[00:00:06.904 --> 00:00:07.545]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:09.246]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:11.127]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:12.548]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:14.309]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:23.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.452]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:49.333]  It, of course, is Tuesday, the ninth day of August 2011.
[00:00:49.393 --> 00:00:53.815]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.775 --> 00:01:01.097]  We have a guest joining us coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:01:02.688 --> 00:01:02.928]  I think?
[00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.652]  The eyewitnesses we've talked to report carjacking, racial attacks.
[00:01:28.593 --> 00:01:30.475]  That's pretty much what's going on here.
[00:01:30.535 --> 00:01:36.742]  But under political correctness, the media is basically refusing to cover that.
[00:01:37.723 --> 00:01:43.809]  But as part of humiliation, whites are made to strip their clothes off and hand them over to the black immigrants.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.082]  And the media occasionally shows it but does not point out what's happening.
[00:01:49.723 --> 00:02:06.994]  And it's the fact that this type of tribal racial warfare is allowed and authorized really shows what the multiculturalist master plan is at the end of the day is to have certain groups that are quote protected and are allowed to carry out these type of actions.
[00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:11.677]  And that's exactly what's going on in England.
[00:02:13.484 --> 00:02:24.852]  Also, it's confirmed that starting on Sunday, we're now into day three of these ongoing riots that have spread all over England, that the police stood down, just like in the Los Angeles riots.
[00:02:25.573 --> 00:02:38.061]  The police completely stood down and allowed the situation to ignite.
[00:02:39.122 --> 00:02:41.804]  And you notice the rioters didn't attack government buildings.
[00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:42.905]  This was not political.
[00:02:43.991 --> 00:03:01.452]  They attacked Gucci handbag stores and electronic stores, desperate for the bling, because the giant welfare state checks, because of currency devaluation, aren't buying people enough swag, and so they're rioting.
[00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:02.553]  Can you imagine?
[00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:15.883]  What is going to happen all over the Western world as we go into the controlled demolition of our economies when the upwards of 50 million people on food stamps and welfare here in the U.S.
[00:03:15.943 --> 00:03:19.265]  alone still get their welfare checks?
[00:03:19.285 --> 00:03:21.547]  You're still going to get them in the mail.
[00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:25.950]  It's just that they're not going to buy what they previously did.
[00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.592]  Now, in the United States,
[00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:35.460]  In areas that have the Second Amendment, you're going to see increased crime, but you're not going to see the mass rioting.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.544]  But I am predicting now, and you're already seeing it start, that in Chicago, in New York City,
[00:03:44.838 --> 00:03:56.943]  And in the few other cities that are victim disarmament zones, I am predicting that as we go deeper into this depression, that in the next two years you are going to see those cities burned to the ground.
[00:03:57.543 --> 00:04:00.625]  You're going to see mass raping, pillage, murder.
[00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:03.666]  And the government, just like in Katrina,
[00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:04.996]  is going to
[00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:42.499]  You let your wives, your husbands be drug out and their clothes torn off their bodies as a sacrament to the multiculturalism.
[00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.121]  As a religious right.
[00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:51.783]  And you will flagellate yourselves with cat or nine tails on your back.
[00:04:53.123 --> 00:04:59.686]  And the globalists will then set up a huge police state to harass law-abiding citizens in response to the riots they allowed.
[00:05:02.492 --> 00:05:05.474]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:10.198]  In August, they celebrate 30 years in the long-term storable food business.
[00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:17.924]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in
[00:05:18.004 --> 00:05:18.504]  We're good to go.
[00:05:39.392 --> 00:05:42.833]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex and get 30% off a one year food supply.
[00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:45.414]  If you have ever considered getting a supply, now is the time.
[00:05:45.434 --> 00:05:45.594]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:47.534]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[00:06:02.472 --> 00:06:07.857]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:13.902]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:21.048]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.332]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:29.376]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:31.343 --> 00:06:35.345]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.227]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:40.748]  Others don't.
[00:06:41.148 --> 00:06:43.029]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:44.790]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.631]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:54.215]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:56.796]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:06:57.276 --> 00:06:59.317]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[00:06:59.657 --> 00:07:00.158]  Others don't.
[00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:07.363]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:13.605]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:07:14.185 --> 00:07:15.925]  Number one, study the past.
[00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:18.206]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:07:18.847 --> 00:07:22.568]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:25.950]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:07:26.791 --> 00:07:30.053]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:35.356]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:07:35.676 --> 00:07:39.118]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:07:39.678 --> 00:07:42.540]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.723]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:07:47.563 --> 00:07:51.806]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:07:52.507 --> 00:07:56.610]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.893]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:08:03.235 --> 00:08:08.720]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.146 --> 00:08:28.954]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is being reported that a giant bet was placed a month ago.
[00:08:30.538 --> 00:08:31.579]  Against the U.S.
[00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:32.039]  dollar.
[00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.560]  We know who's done that in the past.
[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:43.965]  George Soros and the Daily Mail and others are reporting that there are direct links to Soros and it's believed that he led the move to do that.
[00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:52.450]  Now of course S&P is the same criminal organization that knowingly, knowingly certified
[00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:59.867]  That the AAA rated, derivative, totally worthless garbage was pure AAA gold.
[00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:06.070]  And that was sold to the US government, state governments, private individuals, pension funds, you name it.
[00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.472]  And now we are tied to that 1.5 quadrillion.
[00:09:09.872 --> 00:09:14.295]  The American people's 600 plus trillion, supposedly, that we owe.
[00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:21.479]  Now, I don't usually agree with Michael Moore, but he's challenged Obama to arrest the heads of S&P.
[00:09:23.092 --> 00:09:33.115]  I actually talked about that with Webster Griffin Tarpley, economist and historian yesterday, because this is economic sabotage.
[00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:37.656]  If the banks are being rated AAA, then S&P can't rate the U.S.
[00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:39.437]  government less than AAA.
[00:09:39.957 --> 00:09:41.477]  It is a fraud on its face.
[00:09:41.837 --> 00:09:46.139]  The government can create credit out of nothing like Abraham Lincoln or JFK.
[00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:56.346]  And so S&P is engaged in a financial form of terrorism, along with the big banks that pay them to rate their garbage.
[00:09:56.826 --> 00:10:03.791]  So the very groups that have maneuvered us into this position are now downgrading the United States to bankrupt counties, cities, and states.
[00:10:04.252 --> 00:10:14.880]  When we are not bankrupt, if we don't sign on to the fraudulent derivatives, as Naomi Prins, former managing director of Goldman Sachs, agreed yesterday, as Ron Paul has said it, if we say no,
[00:10:16.209 --> 00:10:22.395]  To all of that fraudulent paper that is not our debts, we are not in the red.
[00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:23.816]  We are in the black big time.
[00:10:24.257 --> 00:10:27.299]  We have incredible engines of prosperity.
[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.502]  We still have a good infrastructure.
[00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:30.643]  We still have great minds.
[00:10:31.343 --> 00:10:37.869]  The United States has gone from the greatest creditor nation in the last few decades to the greatest debtor nation by fraud!
[00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.131]  We'll give you the latest on gold.
[00:10:40.551 --> 00:10:43.673]  Turbocharging to 1,780 plus.
[00:10:45.214 --> 00:10:52.079]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others saying they believe it's going to go to 2,500 an ounce in the next three months.
[00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:54.095]  This is huge news.
[00:10:54.916 --> 00:10:56.076]  We told you that was coming.
[00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:57.677]  It's just incredible.
[00:10:58.417 --> 00:11:00.218]  Fed forced to consider fresh stimulus.
[00:11:00.258 --> 00:11:02.139]  We told you that was coming with the Super Congress.
[00:11:02.499 --> 00:11:03.719]  This has all been designed.
[00:11:03.999 --> 00:11:09.401]  We've called it because we've seen them do this in First World, Old World, and Third World countries over and over again.
[00:11:09.701 --> 00:11:12.442]  This is a standard operation.
[00:11:12.843 --> 00:11:13.963]  We've got their playbook.
[00:11:14.003 --> 00:11:15.043]  We know what they're going to call.
[00:11:15.824 --> 00:11:16.064]  Okay.
[00:11:16.524 --> 00:11:16.764]  Okay.
[00:11:16.804 --> 00:11:17.705]  Let me stop right there.
[00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:24.011]  We've got joining us Paul Watson and Steve Watson at the bottom of the hour.
[00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:24.891]  Steve is in London.
[00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:29.173]  Paul Watson now just lives just north of London.
[00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:31.434]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be joining us.
[00:11:31.474 --> 00:11:37.117]  His group's been called terrorists now by the police for criticizing the corruption in courtside.
[00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:44.360]  Mark Moreno on Al Gore admitting that their entire global warming hoax is imploding and throwing fits.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.561]  He's going to be joining us at the very end of the broadcast today.
[00:11:47.621 --> 00:11:47.821]  Now!
[00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:48.562]  Now!
[00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:57.004]  Joining us from Brixton, South London, is Patrick Henningsen, and he's also going to be on RT later today.
[00:11:57.364 --> 00:11:59.426]  He is an amazing documentary filmmaker.
[00:11:59.446 --> 00:12:04.029]  He's provided us with amazing footage that we've used, covering Copenhagen event.
[00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.131]  He's reported for us from there.
[00:12:06.531 --> 00:12:13.417]  He's a graduate of Cal Poly SLO in California, with over a decade's experience in public relations and corporate communications.
[00:12:13.457 --> 00:12:14.137]  He lives in the UK.
[00:12:15.258 --> 00:12:36.130]  And he joins us, and we'll also give you his website, but he had the courage to spend the last two and a half days in the middle of it, and he can confirm, and we'll put the map up for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, of the confirmed fires, riots, women jumping out of burning buildings, carjackings, and he witnessed it.
[00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.631]  And yes, the photos are confirmed.
[00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.052]  Much of this started as racial attacks on white people.
[00:12:42.432 --> 00:12:45.032]  Whites being stripped down naked as a form of humiliation.
[00:12:45.553 --> 00:12:48.273]  And the politically correct media is now being forced to report on it.
[00:12:48.894 --> 00:12:51.274]  This is getting more and more insane by the minute.
[00:12:51.314 --> 00:12:54.315]  This is political correctness gone wild.
[00:12:54.975 --> 00:13:03.238]  And joining us is Patrick Henningsen from South London, Brixton, the epicenter of the situation that's now spread all over
[00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:05.959]  Hey, good to be with you Alex.
[00:13:05.979 --> 00:13:06.499]  Thank you very much.
[00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:39.721]  It wasn't so much I was looking to be in the middle of it, but I live in Brixton, so it was unavoidable, basically.
[00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:46.291]  But I spent most of Sunday night, we're barricaded in a pub on Stockwell Road.
[00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.429]  I'm good.
[00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:19.222]  Okay, we didn't have time to talk much beforehand, so I was just imagining as a reporter that you went down to cover it, but you were actually barricaded in.
[00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:29.149]  Please continue with any detail you've got of the type of carjacking that you witnessed, and we're seeing the photos of whites being stripped down naked.
[00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.851]  In fact, if you guys go to the Daily Mail, we can show folks that.
[00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:32.852]  It's linked on Drudge Report.
[00:14:34.273 --> 00:14:36.855]  And reportedly, it started as racial attacks.
[00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:48.877]  And now that it's expanded out to both black hoodlums and white hoodlums, some of the Western media has tried to spin it that it's Muslims, but Paul Watson and Steve Watson say they haven't seen Muslims involved.
[00:14:49.502 --> 00:14:53.868]  Yeah, well, there's a very odd chain of events that started this ball rolling.
[00:14:54.729 --> 00:14:56.071]  The first one was in Tottenham.
[00:14:56.371 --> 00:14:57.592]  That was on a Saturday evening.
[00:14:57.953 --> 00:15:06.444]  That was a demonstration, a public demonstration against a local resident who had been shot fatally by the local Metropolitan Police.
[00:15:08.306 --> 00:15:10.389]  Allegedly in some sort of a gun sting.
[00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:16.478]  Now, that demonstration went a bit wrong and turned into full-scale riots on Saturday night.
[00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:23.409]  On Sunday, Brixton had its annual carnival, which is called the Brixton Splash, with 30,000 people in attendance.
[00:15:23.889 --> 00:15:35.477]  Now, mind you, Brixton is the site of the 1981 riots, which was the UK's equivalent to the Watts Los Angeles riots in the 80s and also earlier in the late 60s.
[00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:42.482]  So Brixton has always been a flashpoint for social unrest, especially for racial tension.
[00:15:43.022 --> 00:15:45.624]  The majority of the area is Afro-Caribbean.
[00:15:47.086 --> 00:15:47.587]  I'm good.
[00:16:00.054 --> 00:16:02.175]  Well, people need to stop being so passive.
[00:16:03.016 --> 00:16:06.158]  Guns or no guns, I couldn't control myself.
[00:16:06.178 --> 00:16:11.221]  If people were out carjacking folks and I was even disarmed, I would just put nails through baseball bats and go to town.
[00:16:11.561 --> 00:16:16.304]  I mean, this type of stuff, if the police won't protect the people, first they take your guns, then they won't protect you.
[00:16:16.624 --> 00:16:24.669]  You guys barricaded yourself in a bar, so you are confirming that these are basically a race war style attack is how this began?
[00:16:25.336 --> 00:16:31.340]  Well, it began as an anti-police demonstration.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:37.683]  The Brixton riots were what I call the New Riot, which is the retail riot.
[00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:49.430]  Basically, these are just young kids between the age of 12 and 20 out in mass using their BlackBerrys to communicate and to move in groups and to hit specific targets at the same time.
[00:16:50.671 --> 00:16:53.933]  They've caught the police on their back heels over and over and over again.
[00:16:54.253 --> 00:16:55.894]  Okay, so correct me.
[00:16:56.414 --> 00:16:59.716]  It started, so there's a multi-faceted, and that's borne out by the news.
[00:17:00.156 --> 00:17:16.224]  It started as a police demonstration, then a racial, racially motivated style attack, and then it metastasized into, and that's what it shows now, groups of all colors out just looting trinkets and goodies.
[00:17:17.555 --> 00:17:18.075]  I don't know.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.681]  That's another story.
[00:17:37.101 --> 00:17:41.805]  But the majority of the Brixton riots, 99.9% were Afro-Caribbean.
[00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:54.236]  Of course, any police officer that will come down in public on a young black man could face another mob on his back and could create another incident.
[00:17:54.256 --> 00:17:55.837]  So the political correctness gone wrong.
[00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:58.099]  You have actually hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[00:17:58.559 --> 00:18:00.101]  That is one of the reasons why
[00:18:00.761 --> 00:18:07.488]  Um, uh, communities and, uh, emergency services and police and everyone's got their hands tied.
[00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:24.285]  Everyone except these kids who are absolutely running wild, who, by the way, Alex, are being directed, um, by their higher-ups in gangs, um, who are going out, getting retail stuff to order, being told what to get, where to get it, and this is all being coordinated up the gang chain.
[00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.786]  That's now, by the way, everything you're saying has been confirmed.
[00:18:26.826 --> 00:18:35.931]  It's all within just a few hours was for sale on eBay and other places online, and they could follow the Twitter as the gang bosses direct them.
[00:18:36.291 --> 00:18:43.795]  They could instantly follow that back to its geolocation on its computer or phone and arrest these people, but of course they don't.
[00:18:44.195 --> 00:18:49.338]  In every case, the 7-7 bombers run by a known member, Mr. Aswat, of MI6.
[00:18:49.398 --> 00:18:52.379]  That's Fox News, BBC.
[00:18:52.439 --> 00:18:53.380]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:00.724]  LA riots, police stand down, and now the reports we're getting from Steve Watson is this is going to be used against the general public.
[00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:11.431]  Steve Watson, years ago, taking his, you know, very beautiful girlfriend out to dinner, the police come over and ask you questions, look at your ID, ask if you're a terrorist, but they don't dare mess with the gangbangers.
[00:19:11.651 --> 00:19:20.356]  So they use the crime as a pretext to then come and dominate the general public, and the police are trained to only alert on law-abiding type people.
[00:19:20.396 --> 00:19:20.917]  Is that true?
[00:19:22.609 --> 00:19:25.811]  And there's a few results that are going to come out in this, Alex.
[00:19:25.871 --> 00:19:27.371]  I'll tell you, I'll make a prediction.
[00:19:27.892 --> 00:19:46.561]  One, in the media in the next week, when this is calmed down, if it calms down, it's going to be a divide between those who want more security and more police on the ground and heavier law enforcement capability and those who are pro-community and are wanting to actually address the causes of the illness rather than the symptoms.
[00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:48.203]  Patrick, I know you've got to go.
[00:19:48.243 --> 00:19:51.486]  You've got to get down to the RT Studios and do a report.
[00:19:51.506 --> 00:19:52.307]  I'm going to give you a website.
[00:19:52.327 --> 00:19:53.668]  I'm going to do one more segment with you.
[00:19:53.688 --> 00:19:55.710]  The answer is firearms.
[00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.774]  You try to carjack me, you're all going to die.
[00:19:59.814 --> 00:20:00.474]  You understand?
[00:20:02.355 --> 00:20:05.179]  Why is it so many people suffer from so many illnesses today?
[00:20:05.499 --> 00:20:07.121]  Why don't doctors know how to help you?
[00:20:07.362 --> 00:20:12.569]  Could it be that our doctors don't know how because there's a nutrition solution and they only know about drugs?
[00:20:13.069 --> 00:20:16.955]  Over 68 diseases are known to be connected to a deficiency of glutathione.
[00:20:17.355 --> 00:20:21.819]  The missing ingredient to increasing your body's production of glutathione is cysteine.
[00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:34.689]  Raising your glutathione production protects you from cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[00:20:35.109 --> 00:20:38.072]  Nature's richest source of cysteine is unheated whey.
[00:20:38.652 --> 00:20:40.513]  Heating can damage much of the cysteine.
[00:20:40.853 --> 00:20:44.494]  One World Whey is the first undamaged whey protein powder on the market.
[00:20:44.674 --> 00:20:50.936]  Using One World Whey may support optimal glutathione production, unlike any other food or supplement you've ever taken.
[00:20:51.096 --> 00:20:51.576]  Call 888-988-3325.
[00:20:51.636 --> 00:20:51.817]  That's 888-988-3325.

[00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:07.315]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:13.581]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:22:14.122 --> 00:22:15.883]  Number one, study the past.
[00:22:16.404 --> 00:22:18.166]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:22:18.807 --> 00:22:22.530]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:22:23.638 --> 00:22:25.900]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.983]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:22:30.563 --> 00:22:35.286]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:22:35.607 --> 00:22:39.069]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:22:39.629 --> 00:22:42.491]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:22:43.032 --> 00:22:46.614]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:51.762]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[00:22:57.069 --> 00:22:59.233]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:23:01.212 --> 00:23:05.014]  HempUSA.org brings you pure camembert powder.

[00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.591]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:36.154]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:36.334 --> 00:23:42.038]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:23:42.138 --> 00:23:45.560]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.382]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:48.502 --> 00:23:53.405]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:23:53.565 --> 00:23:53.786]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:23:53.806 --> 00:23:55.207]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:14.763 --> 00:24:26.086]  Look, ladies and gentlemen, everyone knows that I despise the racial division issues that are used to divide and conquer us.
[00:24:26.906 --> 00:24:40.129]  But all over the country, including the mayor of Philadelphia and others, are having to come out and, you know, tell black youth to stop rioting, to stop engaging in racial attacks.
[00:24:41.466 --> 00:24:59.816]  And it is, we are so politically correct in the West now that the people doing this think it's their right to pull over a family, jerk people out of the car, strip their clothes off, and then the media, the British media, the UK media that will report on this is being demonized by other media.
[00:25:00.576 --> 00:25:02.717]  Okay, this is very very serious.
[00:25:02.737 --> 00:25:07.278]  That's one reason if it's not a provocateur action that the police are standing down.
[00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:10.319]  They are that afraid, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:10.339 --> 00:25:13.980]  And then of course the higher-level social engineers, they know what they're doing.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.241]  They'll just use this to take everybody's rights.
[00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:18.802]  So this is very very dangerous.
[00:25:19.082 --> 00:25:21.362]  Hundreds of riots and lootings and attacks.
[00:25:21.783 --> 00:25:23.083]  Now talking about
[00:25:23.343 --> 00:25:33.913]  To Patrick Henningsen, who is a reporter of long, renowned, doing a great job reporting for us from Copenhagen at the UN Summit, an impeccable source.
[00:25:34.714 --> 00:25:40.519]  Patrick, going back, because I brought in the break, I said, what color were the people being drug out of the cars?
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.126]  And you told us, please repeat on record exactly what you witnessed.
[00:25:48.174 --> 00:26:04.166]  Yeah, I did witness a white male, age 30, his car was stopped, the street was barricaded with wheelie bins, or rubbish bins, and he was tempted to pull out of the car and another imposter's body came.
[00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:10.871]  He was beaten by six or seven men and left there in the rain as they ran up the street.
[00:26:11.671 --> 00:26:21.603]  Now, this could have been anybody, but it just happened to be there was a color divide in Brixton, and most of the looters and rioters were young black males.
[00:26:22.295 --> 00:26:24.696]  But it's a bigger problem than that, as you well know.
[00:26:24.716 --> 00:26:27.278]  This is a massive problem.
[00:26:27.318 --> 00:26:29.339]  However, it's going to turn into a racial divide.
[00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:31.120]  There's already tension on the streets.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.482]  You can feel it when you're walking down through Brixton.
[00:26:33.882 --> 00:26:37.464]  Half the people are saying in their head, who's responsible for this?
[00:26:37.784 --> 00:26:40.546]  The other half are thinking, why are they looking at me like that?
[00:26:41.106 --> 00:26:42.267]  And that's only going to get worse.
[00:26:43.087 --> 00:27:02.819]  So I can only say that this is a big warning shot out to the government, to David Cameron, and to Tony Blair before him, who were very, very interested in bombing the innocent people of Libya, spending their money and their attention plundering Iraq and Afghanistan, and they've taken their eye off the ball for about 10 or 12 years.
[00:27:05.031 --> 00:27:15.599]  Well, it turns out Tony Blair had a long-term secret immigration plan to actually bring the illegals in as a political constituency.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:29.811]  But to be specific, unless I misheard you, because I want this on record, Patrick Henningsen, you're saying you did witness barricades, black males attempting to pull people out of cars and successfully pulling a white male out and beating him.
[00:27:30.311 --> 00:27:32.513]  Did you witness black males doing that to a white male?
[00:27:33.662 --> 00:27:35.643]  I didn't see the color of the guy in the car.
[00:27:36.603 --> 00:27:38.803]  I couldn't see if they had jumped in the car or not.
[00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:46.645]  But I did see the person who was trying to help him was a white male and he was beaten as a result of his intervention.
[00:27:47.166 --> 00:27:56.108]  Now, it was such a situation that you couldn't even go out in the street to help the person because... No, no, I understand, but he was beaten by, the white man was beaten by what color people?
[00:28:01.138 --> 00:28:06.144]  Yeah, I mean, that's how politically correct we've all gotten.
[00:28:06.524 --> 00:28:09.567]  Myself included, that I had to interrogate you to even get you to say it.
[00:28:10.108 --> 00:28:12.130]  And I'm not criticizing you, Patrick.
[00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.773]  I understand the fact that we all want to get along.
[00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:18.437]  But the only way we're going to stop this is by decrying it.
[00:28:18.877 --> 00:28:21.779]  And that's why I've protested people like the Ku Klux Klan.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:30.206]  But the fact that we have black groups more and more thinking it's their right to beat the daylights out of or rob white people is wrong.
[00:28:30.786 --> 00:28:33.228]  And at the end of the day, it's going to end up hurting black folks.
[00:28:33.248 --> 00:28:33.909]  What do you say to that?
[00:28:34.684 --> 00:28:35.144]  I agree.
[00:28:35.285 --> 00:28:45.194]  And the politicians don't need to be telling black communities to tell their children to not engage in this kind of crime.
[00:28:46.114 --> 00:28:52.921]  Parents, the families of these children in the black community need to take responsibility, which they're clearly not.
[00:28:53.321 --> 00:28:57.385]  At 2 a.m., if your kid's out running around with his police helicopters,
[00:28:58.005 --> 00:28:59.286]  In closing, absolutely.
[00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:01.348]  Give us your website to Patrick Henningsen.
[00:29:25.134 --> 00:29:28.516]  Our website is 21stcenturywire.com.
[00:29:28.996 --> 00:29:34.419]  That's 21stcenturywire.com.
[00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:35.540]  21stcenturywire.com.
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.762]  You get a lot of reports on there, and we're trying to keep up.
[00:29:38.962 --> 00:29:48.047]  In fact, the criminals in North London are issuing leaflets on the streets saying, don't talk to anybody, change your haircut so you won't be identified from CCTV.
[00:29:48.937 --> 00:29:50.237]  We're gonna have to get you back on.
[00:29:50.257 --> 00:29:52.518]  Go do your RT interview and pop in later.
[00:29:52.538 --> 00:29:53.298]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.798 --> 00:29:55.418]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.339 --> 00:29:59.099]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:09.501]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator... Buildings with white people in them set on fire.
[00:30:09.961 --> 00:30:11.782]  White women jumping out of...
[00:30:13.342 --> 00:30:15.183]  Burning buildings to police and firemen.
[00:30:16.644 --> 00:30:19.706]  Whites being drug out of cars, being beaten with an inch of their life.
[00:30:20.327 --> 00:30:24.790]  Whites made to strip down naked and give black immigrants their clothes.
[00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:32.175]  I mean, imagine if white people were going around pulling black people out of cars and beating them up and burning their houses down.
[00:30:33.075 --> 00:30:39.218]  I mean, the average Brit is a politically correct, anti-white worshipper of political correctness.
[00:30:40.058 --> 00:30:41.279]  I mean, I know a lot of Brits.
[00:30:41.479 --> 00:30:44.540]  They are seized by self-loathing and hate.
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.902]  They are worshippers of anything non-European.
[00:30:48.562 --> 00:30:50.403]  And this is what they're now going to get.
[00:30:50.423 --> 00:31:03.028]  Now on the other end, I don't like the globalists who are using all of this to get us at each other's throats while engaging in soft kill eugenics against blacks, Hispanics, Asians, whites, everybody.
[00:31:04.429 --> 00:31:05.989]  I know it's programming.
[00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:12.572]  And I understand that it's what the social engineers, the cultural Marxists, that's what they call themselves,
[00:31:13.928 --> 00:31:15.009]  Do you
[00:31:34.924 --> 00:31:37.045]  Upwards of half the population of the U.S.
[00:31:37.085 --> 00:31:42.609]  survives off a government paycheck, whether it's Social Security, doesn't matter if you paid into it, the government now controls you.
[00:31:43.789 --> 00:31:47.691]  Upwards of 50 million, they said it's 45.9 million on food stamps.
[00:31:47.711 --> 00:31:49.933]  There's another 4 or 5 million that are on supplemental.
[00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:51.594]  There's other forms of state.
[00:31:51.674 --> 00:31:54.275]  It's probably more than 50 million on food stamps.
[00:31:54.375 --> 00:32:00.419]  That's 50 million people every day in a digital food line, a digital soup line.
[00:32:01.962 --> 00:32:04.908]  Uh, this country is degenerating.
[00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.035]  And Madison Avenue MTV culture...
[00:32:09.485 --> 00:32:23.878]  Has sold an idea of gangsterism and crime, and the young white kids dress like gangsters and festoon themselves in the outfits and have their pants hanging down over their hind ends saying, I'm a punk, I'm a sex slave.
[00:32:23.898 --> 00:32:25.179]  That's what that means from prison.
[00:32:26.581 --> 00:32:32.746]  The young males try to dress and act like gangsters as part of their manhood to scare people.
[00:32:33.027 --> 00:32:35.049]  Most of them are completely cowardly jellyfish.
[00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:47.879]  Whites, Hispanics, Blacks, you look at the youth, you go to any restaurant, any store, more than half of them look like absolute, mentally deranged, brain-damaged fools.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.883]  And what's going to happen is, more and more of this is going to happen in the U.S., and they're going to die.
[00:32:53.883 --> 00:33:01.770]  Because some of us are real men, we're not playing games, we got our Second Amendment, our ancestors fought for it, we're not slaves to the Queen of England, and we're not going along with it.
[00:33:02.532 --> 00:33:02.832]  Okay.
[00:33:03.773 --> 00:33:22.485]  And you notice that's why the gangbangers in Chicago, New York, L.A., places where they've really restricted the Second Amendment, where the public can't defend themselves, where politically correct effeminate men are just cowering in fear, that it's the type of places where people are fed on indiscriminately.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.701]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[00:33:24.761 --> 00:33:27.844]  I wouldn't need a gun if a group of people were trying to attack me.
[00:33:28.304 --> 00:33:32.568]  You get five, six people attacking you, folks, that's when Tyrannosaurus Rex comes out.
[00:33:32.768 --> 00:33:34.910]  That's when a big can of you-know-what gets opened up.
[00:33:35.451 --> 00:33:36.732]  And I'm talking about anybody.
[00:33:37.272 --> 00:33:43.978]  If you're not in touch with your instincts, ladies and gentlemen, a little bitty raccoon, if it's cornered, can beat up Mike Tyson.
[00:33:44.761 --> 00:33:45.582]  Because it's cornered.
[00:33:46.122 --> 00:33:46.582]  Believe me.
[00:33:46.743 --> 00:33:48.464]  Raccoons kill big hunting dogs.
[00:33:48.484 --> 00:33:50.766]  They'll get them in the water, grab their ears, push them down.
[00:33:51.286 --> 00:33:53.788]  Any of us could act like a raccoon when cornered.
[00:33:54.148 --> 00:34:01.334]  And I don't know how you've lost your fight, how you've lost your guts, how people could sit there and let people beat them up.
[00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:02.955]  It is pathetic.
[00:34:02.995 --> 00:34:08.479]  I've watched these videos of these cowardly Brits just sit there and pull their clothes off and do whatever they're told.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.740]  And I've been there.
[00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.642]  I've been racially attacked growing up in Dallas.
[00:34:11.962 --> 00:34:12.983]  And let me tell you something.
[00:34:13.043 --> 00:34:14.164]  I gave as good as I got.
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.627]  And bullies don't like it, even in the end, if they start winning, if they get hurt.
[00:34:20.348 --> 00:34:24.150]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, you don't need a gun to kill somebody.
[00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:25.870]  All you gotta have is the will.
[00:34:26.711 --> 00:34:27.251]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:27.391 --> 00:34:31.693]  It really freaks me out to watch how domesticated people have got.
[00:34:32.053 --> 00:34:33.313]  And it really gets my blood up.
[00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:44.298]  Now, that said, I don't know if Watson on Skype and Ted Anderson on the sat line, if we can play that clip of Greenspan.
[00:34:44.318 --> 00:34:45.078]  Are we able to play that?
[00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.385]  We got it, okay.
[00:34:47.725 --> 00:34:50.388]  I'm gonna get back into the riots later in all the details.
[00:34:51.168 --> 00:34:58.115]  But the fact that the media, predominantly, some will cover it, will not get into the fact that this is racial.
[00:34:58.716 --> 00:35:04.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, I get mad when I hear about the Klan lynching some black person, pulling them over on the side of the road and doing it.
[00:35:05.282 --> 00:35:07.583]  I get mad at people being cornered and outnumbered.
[00:35:07.923 --> 00:35:09.063]  That's why I've spoke out against it.
[00:35:09.323 --> 00:35:17.885]  But I'm sick of some black people out there that think it's their right to talk about white people like we're not human beings and like we did something to you.
[00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:20.726]  Most white people, ancestors were slaves.
[00:35:20.946 --> 00:35:22.206]  If you knew your stinking history.
[00:35:22.426 --> 00:35:25.127]  Of course, it's not just black folks that obviously don't know their history.
[00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:29.288]  We're taught all this black history stuff to get us at each other's throats.
[00:35:29.688 --> 00:35:31.909]  And what you're taught in that history is not the full history.
[00:35:32.169 --> 00:35:33.069]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:35:34.062 --> 00:35:35.002]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:35:35.502 --> 00:35:41.444]  And I'm tired of the bankers using this system to get everybody at each other's throats.
[00:35:41.524 --> 00:35:44.585]  Now, I'm going to Watson, Steve Watson, Paul Watson.
[00:35:45.025 --> 00:35:46.425]  First Paul Watson here in a moment.
[00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.766]  But the economy is a whole nother subject.
[00:35:49.986 --> 00:35:51.027]  A whole nother subject.
[00:35:51.647 --> 00:35:56.588]  Now, here is JP Morgan says gold may jump $2,500 an ounce by year's end.
[00:36:01.676 --> 00:36:08.940]  And it says JP Morgan said on Monday it expects spot gold prices to climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher.
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.083]  Okay, they expect it to go even higher.
[00:36:13.103 --> 00:36:14.204]  This is CNBC.
[00:36:18.486 --> 00:36:20.007]  Do you understand what I just read to you?
[00:36:21.228 --> 00:36:29.493]  They are telling, and they're at the top of the pyramid, in the control system, they're saying it's going to go that high or higher.
[00:36:31.001 --> 00:36:34.283]  Fed officials will meet today after the unprecedented downgrades of the U.S.
[00:36:34.323 --> 00:36:36.504]  top credit shook investor confidence.
[00:36:36.744 --> 00:36:48.832]  And in another article I have dealing with this out of CBC Canada, they talked to the JP Morgan analysts and they say because of inflation and dollar devaluation.
[00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:51.504]  They're finally being honest.
[00:36:51.944 --> 00:36:53.625]  Your gas prices aren't really going up.
[00:36:53.705 --> 00:36:55.345]  Your dollar is worse less.
[00:36:55.925 --> 00:37:00.247]  They're paying the same they were paying five years ago in Switzerland for gasoline or petrol.
[00:37:00.647 --> 00:37:02.588]  You're paying higher because your currency's devalued.
[00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:05.049]  Our dollar's becoming like the peso.
[00:37:05.069 --> 00:37:07.971]  Alright, I gotta go to the Watsons here.
[00:37:10.464 --> 00:37:15.047]  Gold is top 1,780 as investors seek safe haven.
[00:37:16.828 --> 00:37:22.011]  Soros, reportedly, somebody made $10 million off that, knowing that S&P was going to downgrade.
[00:37:22.512 --> 00:37:27.655]  Michael Moore, who I hardly ever agree with, says, show some guts, arrest S&P, head to Obama.
[00:37:28.095 --> 00:37:30.357]  S&P is one of the groups that bankrolled Obama.
[00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:44.406]  We're gonna be breaking all that down, but right now I wanted to briefly, and he'll check in with us later in the broadcast, in this guest-studded program today, I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[00:37:46.984 --> 00:37:48.125]  To break down what we're seeing.
[00:37:48.465 --> 00:37:56.289]  Ted, what does it signify to have JPMorgan Chase coming out and saying that they believe it will hit 2500 or higher, revising their 1800 mark?
[00:38:02.509 --> 00:38:03.711]  That they predicted for the end of the year.
[00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:08.297]  Remember when we were kooks to say gold would hit $500 or $800 or $1,000 or $1,500?
[00:38:08.858 --> 00:38:13.504]  Now, once it's broken through the psychological level of $1,700, Ted, $2,500 and above, what in Hades is going on here?
[00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:24.295]  Well, I mean obviously a lot of money being printed and JP Morgan was one of the founders of the Federal Reserve System back in 1913.
[00:38:24.455 --> 00:38:26.516]  I think they're in the know.
[00:38:27.257 --> 00:38:33.502]  What they're doing is they're talking about printing more money, more stimulus as a matter of fact, and there's a lot of pressure on the Fed right now.
[00:38:33.802 --> 00:38:36.725]  Alex, I've never seen so many headlines about gold.
[00:38:37.085 --> 00:38:39.608]  When I was just browsing this morning, it's terrifying.
[00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:41.330]  Last night, I didn't even sleep.
[00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.932]  I was watching the Asian markets.
[00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:47.077]  Gold hitting up there, like you said, in that $1,780 range.
[00:38:47.478 --> 00:38:51.683]  And now we're sitting here at $1,754.60 high in New York.
[00:38:52.103 --> 00:38:54.786]  I mean, I gotta tell you right now, it's been one...
[00:38:55.707 --> 00:39:03.011]  Amazing rollercoaster ride here at Midas Resources, and I'm sure that's happening in every gold dealer out in the entire United States.
[00:39:03.031 --> 00:39:04.732]  I mean, it's like the trading floor.
[00:39:04.952 --> 00:39:06.914]  The phones are ringing, people are writing orders.
[00:39:07.614 --> 00:39:16.599]  People are racing to treasuries right now because they're driving up the value and driving down the yield because they're afraid that that's one of the few safe havens that they can go to.
[00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:22.923]  Meanwhile, Vietnam is looking at picking up five metric tons of gold.
[00:39:23.143 --> 00:39:23.723]  That's the first
[00:39:23.943 --> 00:39:31.209]  Every major university I look at, Ted, like UT bought half a billion, then another billion, then reportedly another 500 million.
[00:39:31.229 --> 00:39:34.152]  So that's two billion in the last year of gold, quietly.
[00:39:34.172 --> 00:39:35.973]  I mean, that's the University of Texas.
[00:39:35.993 --> 00:39:38.956]  They're all dumping their dollars and getting into gold.
[00:39:39.737 --> 00:39:41.958]  And again, we're the bad guys for being right, Ted.
[00:39:41.978 --> 00:39:45.602]  We totally called this a decade ago when they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[00:39:45.622 --> 00:39:46.783]  We knew they were writing on the wall.
[00:39:47.557 --> 00:39:48.157]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:48.197 --> 00:39:57.083]  And thank God that our people that listen to this show are buying gold, because they're going to be doing okay when everybody else is falling apart.
[00:39:57.523 --> 00:39:59.904]  Yeah, then we'll get that line, somebody may come steal it.
[00:40:00.184 --> 00:40:01.305]  Over your dead body!
[00:40:01.625 --> 00:40:03.266]  Yeah, there's nothing perfect in this world.
[00:40:03.506 --> 00:40:06.588]  Why even have children if you think the government might try to take them someday?
[00:40:06.908 --> 00:40:09.470]  The whole point is, when things get bad, have more children.
[00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:11.051]  When things get bad, fight harder.
[00:40:11.271 --> 00:40:13.272]  When things get bad, get up off your hind ends.
[00:40:13.512 --> 00:40:19.516]  Stop watching Dancing with the Stars and American Idol and all this crud, and get awake to what's going on.
[00:40:19.556 --> 00:40:20.496]  Get a second job.
[00:40:20.536 --> 00:40:21.477]  Start saving money.
[00:40:21.497 --> 00:40:22.638]  Start getting yourself ready.
[00:40:22.698 --> 00:40:23.398]  Buy guns.
[00:40:23.418 --> 00:40:24.679]  Because I'm telling you folks...
[00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:31.906]  Our chances are slim to none that we're not going into a total collapse, road warrior situation that these bankers have set up.
[00:40:32.146 --> 00:40:43.938]  When they had a hurricane three or four years ago, hit Houston and flooded out, all the way up at our ranch in Northeast Texas, there were marauding groups, predominantly of illegal aliens, robbing everybody they could, and quite a bit of them got shot.
[00:40:44.218 --> 00:40:48.383]  That's the only thing that turned it back, when five million illegal aliens got flushed out of there.
[00:40:48.783 --> 00:40:54.906]  And what I'm telling you is, ladies and gentlemen, as society continues to degenerate, we're in trouble, Ted.
[00:40:55.206 --> 00:40:59.209]  Look at the riots and looting and racial attacks starting everywhere.
[00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:01.510]  This has been the globalist plan.
[00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:11.755]  What happens when the welfare checks have been devalued through currency devaluation and they don't buy the things that these people need?
[00:41:12.055 --> 00:41:12.796]  What's going to happen?
[00:41:13.436 --> 00:41:14.998]  Well, it's gonna be hunting time!
[00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.562]  And what's the most weak, pathetic creature in the West?
[00:41:17.822 --> 00:41:19.425]  Pathetic, chicken-necked white people!
[00:41:19.665 --> 00:41:20.767]  We are on the dinner table!
[00:41:21.408 --> 00:41:22.549]  Yeah, I know you're right about that.
[00:41:22.809 --> 00:41:30.016]  And one thing for sure, Alex, if people keep their money in paper, you're going to have your money stolen from you through inflation and the printing press.
[00:41:30.336 --> 00:41:32.338]  Because right now, that's what they're turning to.
[00:41:32.639 --> 00:41:42.027]  They're looking for the Fed to pour the printing press on, and we're looking at the type of situation that Weimar Republic was looking at, and also Argentina, Brazil, Mexico.
[00:41:42.288 --> 00:41:43.709]  I mean, the list goes on and on.
[00:41:43.769 --> 00:41:44.650]  And Ted, I'll go back.
[00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.231]  As societies degenerate, people break into gangs.
[00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.012]  Look at prisons.
[00:41:48.492 --> 00:41:49.973]  This is gang mentality.
[00:41:50.674 --> 00:41:58.099]  This isn't going to be the depression in the 30s when most people were agrarian and self-sufficient and Christian, regardless of what color they were.
[00:41:58.499 --> 00:42:06.424]  Pete, we are an immoral, decadent, gang-driven society with 50 years of a prison culture breeding a gang mentality.
[00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:07.745]  The police are a gang.
[00:42:07.785 --> 00:42:08.906]  All the other groups are gangs.
[00:42:09.166 --> 00:42:11.027]  We are going to descend into hell, Ted.
[00:42:11.407 --> 00:42:11.928]  I'm sorry.
[00:42:11.948 --> 00:42:13.649]  I'm just telling folks now what I really think.
[00:42:14.209 --> 00:42:16.951]  We, I mean, I am dug in with firearms and food.
[00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:17.451]  I'm ready.
[00:42:18.292 --> 00:42:19.213]  Don't tread on me!
[00:42:19.253 --> 00:42:20.153]  That's all I gotta say.
[00:42:44.069 --> 00:42:44.930]  Absolutely, Ted.
[00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:45.630]  This in now.
[00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.492]  Police lose control of London streets for third night.
[00:42:48.852 --> 00:42:50.713]  Riots spread across UK.
[00:42:51.033 --> 00:42:51.654]  Hundreds of them.
[00:42:51.734 --> 00:42:55.376]  Burnings, racial attacks, mass burning, riots.
[00:42:56.036 --> 00:42:58.778]  Rioters rob people on street, force them to strip naked.
[00:42:59.918 --> 00:43:02.020]  It just goes on and on and on.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.861]  They're talking about martial law.
[00:43:04.201 --> 00:43:05.862]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:43:05.902 --> 00:43:07.443]  Women jumping out of burning buildings.
[00:43:07.863 --> 00:43:09.064]  And Ted, we ain't seen
[00:43:09.964 --> 00:43:10.545]  Nothing yet.
[00:43:11.125 --> 00:43:23.394]  It's even been in mainstream news that the real rich have all been moving to mountain redoubts, to the Cook Islands, to the middle of nowhere, to the upland jungles of Asia.
[00:43:23.795 --> 00:43:32.441]  The elites have all been pulling out to Wyoming, Montana, heavily armed, building bunkers, because they know they've engineered the total collapse.
[00:43:32.701 --> 00:43:34.703]  They're going to let us all basically burn out and
[00:43:35.183 --> 00:43:37.764]  And then beg for a police state to come in behind it.
[00:43:38.084 --> 00:43:42.665]  People need to get gold and silver now before it is $2,500 an ounce.
[00:43:43.385 --> 00:43:44.985]  Ted, tell, because here's the good news.
[00:43:45.185 --> 00:43:46.666]  You've been buying the gold when it's lower.
[00:43:46.966 --> 00:43:50.747]  The gold and silver you've got right now, when did you purchase most of that?
[00:43:51.007 --> 00:43:55.808]  How big of a discount are you passing on to people right now and give folks today's gold and silver offer?
[00:43:56.048 --> 00:43:59.789]  Then we're going to Paul Watson via video Skype and Steve Watson via telephone.
[00:44:00.129 --> 00:44:06.695]  From the center of Airstrip One, the UK, with their lovely multicultural riots.
[00:44:06.735 --> 00:44:07.115]  Go ahead.
[00:44:17.364 --> 00:44:18.405]  British sovereigns are at 378.
[00:44:19.465 --> 00:44:20.786]  Franks are at 381.
[00:44:20.886 --> 00:44:24.887]  Small pieces of gold are things that you can put into your shoe and walk away with.
[00:44:24.947 --> 00:44:28.149]  I mean, it's so important to have little small pieces of gold.
[00:44:28.489 --> 00:44:30.830]  The other thing you can get into right now is the U.S.
[00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:31.250]  Eagle.
[00:44:31.911 --> 00:44:33.551]  That's a good coin as well.
[00:44:33.591 --> 00:44:37.333]  They're sitting right now at a price, hang on just a second, I just want to make sure, there it is, 1869.78.
[00:44:40.314 --> 00:44:43.976]  I really recommend the survival bags of dimes.
[00:44:44.396 --> 00:44:46.036]  Right now, they're at $2,831.
[00:44:46.196 --> 00:44:49.538]  I mean, there's just an array of different things.
[00:44:49.918 --> 00:44:51.918]  I think that's having your money in U.S.
[00:44:51.958 --> 00:44:56.500]  currency right now is a bad mistake in anybody's portfolio.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:07.584]  I mean, at least get to the Swiss franc or something, but I would suggest that you have gold and silver, because gold and silver has been money for 6,000 years, and the banking system cannot mess with it.
[00:45:07.964 --> 00:45:14.787]  You're going to have something that will hold value and has held value for so many years that, you know, it's outside of their control.
[00:45:15.008 --> 00:45:15.628]  Absolutely.
[00:45:15.688 --> 00:45:26.814]  And, Ted, for folks to get the big discounts, and I know you're going to be going up in prices here soon, on the silver, it's still $88 for two silver dollars, free shipping, a free book, and a video.
[00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:30.155]  You can't get two silver dollars for $88 out there delivered.
[00:45:30.255 --> 00:45:31.216]  I mean, there's no way.
[00:45:31.716 --> 00:45:33.437]  That deal's still going, about to go up.
[00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:35.258]  It was just $70 a month ago or so.
[00:45:36.738 --> 00:45:41.421]  All that gold he's mentioning, when you call, say it's the radio special to take advantage of it.
[00:45:41.441 --> 00:45:41.501]  800-686-2237.
[00:45:41.521 --> 00:45:41.601]  800-686-2237.
[00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:43.282]  We told you to buy gold at $300.
[00:45:43.462 --> 00:45:44.522]  It's $1,780, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:52.466 --> 00:45:54.228]  I'm telling you, get involved today.
[00:45:54.248 --> 00:45:54.288]  800-686-2237.
[00:45:54.808 --> 00:46:04.017]  If you want the biggest discounts, ask for them to read off the list of Alex Jones radio specials of the best deals Midas offers.
[00:46:04.037 --> 00:46:04.077]  800-686-2237.
[00:46:04.097 --> 00:46:04.317]  Do not wait.
[00:46:04.337 --> 00:46:04.377]  800-686-237.
[00:46:04.397 --> 00:46:05.558]  Thank you so much, Jen Anderson.
[00:46:05.598 --> 00:46:07.660]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[00:46:14.446 --> 00:46:19.091]  All right, I take you to the ongoing rioting spreading all over the UK.
[00:46:19.111 --> 00:46:26.099]  The looting, the racial attacks, the burning buildings, the looted stores, the political correct ninnies running around worshipping it.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.223]  It's like the second coming of Valhalla.
[00:46:30.084 --> 00:46:34.849]  And we also have all sorts of racial attacks and rioting breaking out across the United States we're going to be covering.
[00:46:35.389 --> 00:46:39.551]  Joining us from just north of London, Paul Joseph Watson, his brother from London, coming up.
[00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:41.271]  Sorry to get you on late here, Paul.
[00:46:41.592 --> 00:46:42.932]  Got stuck with Henningsen earlier.
[00:46:42.992 --> 00:46:46.854]  Very interesting intel on him being barricaded in the pub and watching the racial attacks.
[00:46:47.894 --> 00:46:50.175]  We're going to break here, but what's coming up, Paul Watson?
[00:46:51.857 --> 00:46:59.299]  Well Alex, I've just written an article entitled, The Rioting Underclass Product of a Diseased Culture.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:09.423]  And it gets into the kind of motivations as to why these Clockwork Orange style droogs have launched this assault.
[00:47:10.203 --> 00:47:10.904]  I don't know.
[00:47:29.403 --> 00:47:33.731]  Police, state, martial law, troops on the streets, curfews, and so forth.
[00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:35.113]  We're going to break it down when we come back.
[00:47:35.153 --> 00:47:38.479]  Then we're going to Steve Watson who's in London.
[00:47:38.879 --> 00:47:41.464]  Paul Watson is our guest from PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:41.484 --> 00:47:41.865]  Stay with us.
[00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:52.231]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:56.692]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:47:56.732 --> 00:47:59.273]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques.
[00:47:59.353 --> 00:48:02.114]  Where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them.
[00:48:02.174 --> 00:48:03.234]  How to create the perfect
[00:48:03.234 --> 00:48:03.674]  We're good to go.
[00:48:31.015 --> 00:48:32.337]  They come for your guns!
[00:48:32.557 --> 00:48:34.799]  HideYourGuns.com right now!
[00:48:37.099 --> 00:48:41.122]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:42.764]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:48:43.024 --> 00:48:51.491]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:48:51.932 --> 00:48:55.114]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:48:55.374 --> 00:48:56.255]  But take heart.
[00:48:56.415 --> 00:48:59.938]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:05.183]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:49:05.583 --> 00:49:09.145]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:49:09.425 --> 00:49:10.885]  The globalists are scared.
[00:49:11.145 --> 00:49:12.166]  They've overreached.
[00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:15.647]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.181]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[00:49:39.342 --> 00:49:44.466]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[00:49:44.666 --> 00:49:54.934]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[00:49:55.154 --> 00:49:56.395]  Forget loan modifications.
[00:49:56.475 --> 00:50:02.678]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[00:50:02.838 --> 00:50:08.101]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[00:50:08.281 --> 00:50:12.243]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[00:50:12.563 --> 00:50:20.967]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[00:50:21.127 --> 00:50:22.668]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[00:50:22.688 --> 00:50:22.728]  800-477-9256.
[00:50:22.788 --> 00:50:22.968]  That's 800-477-9256.
[00:50:22.988 --> 00:50:23.829]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[00:50:23.849 --> 00:50:27.091]  You know, Jaren, somebody tried to rob him and his car a while back and he, um,
[00:50:50.464 --> 00:50:54.287]  Beat him up, and probably has to go to court for the guy for sentencing.
[00:50:55.268 --> 00:51:01.613]  And one of our crew members' wife was in Lubbock, and there was an attempted basically racial carjacking.
[00:51:01.633 --> 00:51:05.356]  I mean, let me tell you folks, everybody's wives especially need to be packing heat.
[00:51:06.017 --> 00:51:09.580]  You keep your car doors locked, and somebody tries to break in, you grease them.
[00:51:10.643 --> 00:51:14.945]  And unfortunately in the UK, there's riots going on everywhere.
[00:51:17.026 --> 00:51:24.090]  You really don't have a recourse instead of going absolutely ape with a baseball bat or I guess you can get a hold of a sword or something.
[00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:26.771]  But people have got to learn to defend themselves.
[00:51:26.851 --> 00:51:27.832]  It's this attitude.
[00:51:27.852 --> 00:51:32.014]  It's like grizzly bears are coming in now and eating people because folks aren't hunting them anymore.
[00:51:32.414 --> 00:51:33.875]  Polar bears are coming in and eating people.
[00:51:33.935 --> 00:51:39.178]  Wolves, coyotes are killing folks all the time now because we're domesticated modern ninnies.
[00:51:40.018 --> 00:51:41.739]  And gangs and criminals are going to feed on us.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.142]  Steve Watson coming up from London, finishing up in this segment.
[00:51:45.182 --> 00:51:46.964]  Paul, you've got big reports up.
[00:51:46.984 --> 00:51:48.785]  They're openly talking about martial law.
[00:51:49.165 --> 00:51:51.407]  Why didn't they just clamp down on this in the first place?
[00:51:51.707 --> 00:51:54.209]  Because they love to use it to go after everybody.
[00:51:54.449 --> 00:51:54.790]  Go ahead.
[00:51:55.765 --> 00:52:15.312]  Well, that's the thing that came out of, you know, dozens of eyewitness reports on the first couple of nights, as well as last night, was the fact that on every occasion when these looters went in to burn a building or loot a, you know, a JD Sports or a Tesco or a Debenhams or even local businesses,
[00:52:15.672 --> 00:52:15.953]  Yeah.
[00:52:32.054 --> 00:52:34.396]  Pressure from above and pressure from below.
[00:52:35.437 --> 00:52:47.969]  But anyone who believes that these nihilistic moron scum who are marauding around with their jeans halfway down their thighs represent the vanguard of some organic revolutionary movement
[00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:50.131]  They're completely asinine.
[00:52:50.171 --> 00:52:56.155]  I mean, they're not rioting around Downing Street, Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace.
[00:52:56.815 --> 00:53:03.680]  They're busy filling trolleys full of tennis shoes, you know, iPods, and booze and cigarettes.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:04.660]  They're not interested in political freedom.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.101]  Here's the deal.
[00:53:05.121 --> 00:53:08.123]  If you're pulling people out of cars and robbing them, you need to die.
[00:53:09.013 --> 00:53:10.014]  You need to die.
[00:53:10.475 --> 00:53:12.276]  People need guns to defend themselves.
[00:53:12.697 --> 00:53:15.900]  And the police witness mob attacks, beating people.
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.502]  They need to put these people down.
[00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:19.183]  That's the type of message.
[00:53:19.203 --> 00:53:22.927]  But government has prisons for colleges of corruption.
[00:53:23.247 --> 00:53:25.530]  They send non-violent there to learn how to be criminals.
[00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.312]  They want crime to menace the general public.
[00:53:28.653 --> 00:53:31.375]  Your brother's told the story with his girlfriend going out to eat.
[00:53:32.216 --> 00:53:37.459]  Clean-cut, college-educated, the secret police come up and put you in a database and ask if you're a terrorist.
[00:53:38.099 --> 00:53:38.439]  Okay?
[00:53:38.919 --> 00:53:43.942]  But then, the welfare hordes they bring in, well, those are actually becoming the new police.
[00:53:44.022 --> 00:53:55.107]  So, this is a perfect setup, and they're gonna use it to throw the book at law-abiding citizens and suck off you, because the government's criminal, the police are criminal, and the thug welfare people are criminal.
[00:53:55.368 --> 00:53:55.928]  Paul Watson.
[00:53:57.512 --> 00:53:58.293]  Oh yeah, completely.
[00:53:58.493 --> 00:54:01.194]  It's like a bad zombie movie, I've called it.
[00:54:01.334 --> 00:54:02.995]  It's, you know, Rise of the Idiots.
[00:54:03.936 --> 00:54:06.538]  And I mean, these people, the establishment loves them.
[00:54:06.598 --> 00:54:13.762]  I mean, that's why the multinational corporations, the entertainment industry, MTV, manufactures these rap icons.
[00:54:15.143 --> 00:54:17.645]  These young people are fed on a putrid diet of
[00:54:18.805 --> 00:54:24.567]  Vapid, amoral football stars who live a lifestyle that they could never hope to attain.
[00:54:24.967 --> 00:54:30.048]  So that's why they're, you know, going in Tescos and filling their boots with 40-inch televisions.
[00:54:30.448 --> 00:54:35.490]  And it's all due to this poison-disease culture that they've been fed by the establishment.
[00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:40.814]  And it creates this army of marauding scum that causes havoc and chaos.
[00:54:41.114 --> 00:54:42.855]  The police sit back and do nothing.
[00:54:43.136 --> 00:54:49.901]  Of course, the police are all too keen to crack heads and kettle legitimate protesters when there's a G20 in London.
[00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:58.968]  But when hundreds of marauding scum looting, burning down local businesses, they were attacking charities, they were attacking... It's worse than that!
[00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:04.855]  They beat the guy to death delivering newspapers and then covered it up for fun.
[00:55:05.235 --> 00:55:12.884]  So a Brit delivering newspapers, he must die, but then the marauding scum must be worshipped.
[00:55:13.685 --> 00:55:16.409]  Why don't they recognize him as the new government of England like in Libya?
[00:55:21.454 --> 00:55:24.496]  Congratulations to our friends at eFoodsDirect.com.

[00:56:31.769 --> 00:56:32.790]  Big Brother.
[00:56:37.208 --> 00:56:38.248]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:38.968 --> 00:56:40.069]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:41.529]  You want answers?
[00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:43.210]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:47.551]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:48.051 --> 00:56:52.152]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:56:53.772 --> 00:57:00.974]  Alright, with us about 15 minutes into the hour are Steve Watson from North London and Paul Watson just north of London.
[00:57:02.898 --> 00:57:04.079]  He no longer lives in Sheffield.
[00:57:04.119 --> 00:57:05.340]  He's moved a bit more south.
[00:57:06.541 --> 00:57:15.148]  And racial attacks leading into just absolute hooligans, white, black, it doesn't matter, running around robbing everything.
[00:57:16.258 --> 00:57:22.661]  And the government, with all the CCT cameras, all the surveillance, all the control, they're doing nothing to stop it.
[00:57:22.701 --> 00:57:25.802]  And that's the headline up at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:57:26.102 --> 00:57:28.683]  Police lose control for third night of riots.
[00:57:29.363 --> 00:57:32.244]  The rioting underclass product of a disease culture.
[00:57:32.264 --> 00:57:33.205]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:57:33.625 --> 00:57:37.747]  Police to use plastic bullets on rampaging youth in Britain.
[00:57:38.947 --> 00:57:40.968]  London rioters were showing the rich
[00:57:42.981 --> 00:57:44.102]  We do what we want.
[00:57:44.142 --> 00:57:45.964]  You know, the real rich actually run you.
[00:57:47.065 --> 00:57:50.809]  Sony UK warehouse set ablaze as violence from London riots escalates.
[00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:53.652]  This whole thing has been allowed to happen.
[00:57:54.272 --> 00:57:57.275]  Paul Watson, Steve Watson, join us right now.
[00:57:57.676 --> 00:58:03.501]  Steve Watson, what's your view from the command base of Britannic Majesty London?
[00:58:03.521 --> 00:58:04.783]  What are you witnessing?
[00:58:04.803 --> 00:58:05.724]  What's your take on this?
[00:58:07.188 --> 00:58:08.269]  Well, hi Alex.
[00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:29.322]  I haven't witnessed anything personally yet where I am, but obviously there's several areas surrounding me where, you know, I've got friends that work in there that said when they went to work this morning all the shop fronts were all smashed and looted.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:36.413]  So this is what's going on around us now, but the fact is it's got no political point to it whatsoever.
[00:58:36.473 --> 00:58:41.344]  It's not a political uprising, but I'm seeing people saying that, you know, it's the start of
[00:58:42.256 --> 00:58:45.258]  A revolution and something needs to be done and it's just not.
[00:58:45.438 --> 00:58:46.619]  Well that's what the bankers want.
[00:58:46.639 --> 00:58:58.928]  They actually want an uncoordinated welfare riot, soup kitchen riot, to then use that as I've said like hundreds of times here Steve that this was coming and it will be used to take all of our liberties and this is only the beginning.
[00:58:58.948 --> 00:59:01.170]  I mean have we not been on target on this subject?
[00:59:02.363 --> 00:59:03.024]  Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:59:03.044 --> 00:59:07.687]  This is what we've been saying, but it's going to be used to beef up the police state, obviously.
[00:59:07.707 --> 00:59:14.412]  We've seen this in the... We've reported on white papers that the government's produced saying that they expect this to happen.
[00:59:14.432 --> 00:59:25.341]  I mean, I'm seeing now lots of reports that are not even going into why this has happened or what needs to be done to sort out the social issues behind it.
[00:59:25.381 --> 00:59:27.943]  They're just worried about what they're going to do about the Olympics.
[00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:38.553]  Because we've got the Olympics in London next year, so, you know, oh, we're going to need thousands of more police on the streets, we're going to need pat-downs everywhere, all this kind of thing.
[00:59:38.573 --> 00:59:48.917]  I mean, you've got an underclass of people who just, no matter how dumbed down they are, they've recognised that they've got no future under this system.
[00:59:49.497 --> 00:59:56.640]  You know, they're indentured to debt and slavery, and they're just striking out, not because they think they can
[00:59:57.552 --> 00:59:59.134]  Turn it around and improve things.
[00:59:59.154 --> 01:00:02.419]  They just want to smash it to pieces.
[01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.782]  It's the dissolution of society.
[01:00:05.563 --> 01:00:08.707]  We've got people that are not addressed in the causes of it.
[01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:12.172]  Their actions are just going to make it worse.
[01:00:13.285 --> 01:00:30.036]  Well that's what it's intended to do, but you know there's a racial core to this, Steve, and it's time for folks to call it out for what it is so that people don't think that it's some type of liberal sacrament to drag a skinny white person out of a car and beat them within an inch of their life.
[01:00:31.737 --> 01:00:37.681]  No, there is a racial element to it, but that's, I mean, that's because a lot of these deprived areas have been
[01:00:38.484 --> 01:00:44.487]  You know, flooded with this multicultural project that the government has ongoing.
[01:00:44.987 --> 01:00:46.107]  And it's just not working.
[01:00:46.128 --> 01:00:47.788]  The communities are breaking down.
[01:00:47.848 --> 01:00:50.489]  The communities are fighting with each other.
[01:00:52.242 --> 01:01:04.158]  The police have adopted completely heavy-handed and very often openly racist tactics towards the people there, which means the people hate the police.
[01:01:04.178 --> 01:01:09.945]  The police on the front lines there, a lot of them are not even based there, they're just
[01:01:10.766 --> 01:01:23.895]  They're just being shipped in there into these deprived areas, so they have basically no, you know, they have no care about... Well, the fires and rampaging and the orgy of racial hatred is spreading.
[01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:25.556]  We're gonna come right back.
[01:01:25.596 --> 01:01:29.258]  Steve Watson joining us from London, command base of Airstrip One.
[01:01:29.618 --> 01:01:30.319]  Paul Watson...
[01:01:32.426 --> 01:01:36.048]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:01:36.448 --> 01:01:39.450]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:01:39.690 --> 01:01:44.473]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:01:44.493 --> 01:01:50.656]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:01:50.876 --> 01:01:55.900]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:02.784]  For the Republic identifies the NFL bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:02:02.865 --> 01:02:04.986]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:02:05.226 --> 01:02:06.527]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:02:06.807 --> 01:02:09.009]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:02:09.249 --> 01:02:13.173]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:02:13.633 --> 01:02:16.196]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:02:16.536 --> 01:02:25.645]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:02:28.806 --> 01:02:30.288]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:02:30.508 --> 01:02:35.534]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:02:35.814 --> 01:02:37.156]  Saving means to make money.
[01:02:37.356 --> 01:02:46.146]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:02:46.867 --> 01:02:53.972]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:02:54.392 --> 01:03:02.017]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:03:02.397 --> 01:03:07.320]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.801]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:03:27.281 --> 01:03:31.524]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:03:31.824 --> 01:03:32.105]  Number 1.
[01:03:32.745 --> 01:03:35.887]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:03:36.168 --> 01:03:36.728]  Number 2.
[01:03:37.028 --> 01:03:41.592]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:03:41.932 --> 01:03:42.372]  It's true.
[01:03:42.672 --> 01:03:47.236]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:03:47.536 --> 01:03:48.076]  Number 3.
[01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:51.639]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:03:51.959 --> 01:03:55.662]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:03:55.842 --> 01:03:56.403]  Number 4.
[01:03:56.643 --> 01:03:59.005]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:03:59.405 --> 01:04:02.789]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:03.629]  Number 5.
[01:04:03.870 --> 01:04:07.793]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:04:08.033 --> 01:04:12.778]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:04:13.078 --> 01:04:17.103]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:04:17.243 --> 01:04:18.805]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:04:19.025 --> 01:04:21.107]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:04:21.288 --> 01:04:23.630]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:04:32.659 --> 01:04:36.883]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:38.325]  You want answers?
[01:04:39.085 --> 01:04:40.046]  Well, so does he.
[01:04:40.627 --> 01:04:44.251]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:44.811 --> 01:04:48.915]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:04:59.614 --> 01:05:01.035]  Okay, here's the deal.
[01:05:01.255 --> 01:05:07.419]  There have been hundreds and hundreds of fires, riots, looting in more than 20 towns and cities in England.
[01:05:10.723 --> 01:05:14.066]  It started over the police shooting somebody.
[01:05:14.526 --> 01:05:15.707]  Then it became racial.
[01:05:16.348 --> 01:05:20.851]  But in many towns in England, the rioters are almost exclusively white.
[01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:25.194]  So it started as a racial issue.
[01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:28.717]  Now it's spread to just thugs.
[01:05:29.117 --> 01:05:31.859]  Gangster culture that knows no bounds.
[01:05:31.919 --> 01:05:32.780]  It's across the board.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:38.064]  Running around, burning down shops, charities, looting, stealing.
[01:05:38.724 --> 01:05:39.884]  And I agree with Steve Watson.
[01:05:39.964 --> 01:05:41.425]  Overall, this is an economic issue.
[01:05:41.465 --> 01:05:47.607]  Now, we can put on screen a key article from Monday, April 9th, 2007.
[01:05:48.067 --> 01:05:49.607]  And we also wrote about this at the time.
[01:05:50.228 --> 01:05:54.529]  London Guardian, and in it they link to the big detailed government report.
[01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:58.051]  There's also a Pentagon report the same year saying basically the same thing.
[01:05:58.071 --> 01:06:09.481]  I don't know who plagiarized who, the British Ministry of Defense or the Pentagon, but revolutions, flash mobs and brain chips, a grim vision of the future.
[01:06:10.281 --> 01:06:22.351]  And in this, the British Ministry of Defense predicts that in the coming years, because of austerity over banking collapse, that there will be flash mobs, rapidly descending criminal gangs.
[01:06:22.831 --> 01:06:24.092]  Go read it for yourself.
[01:06:25.137 --> 01:06:35.785]  And that's in Paul Joseph Watson and Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes and Kurt Nemo's articles that are all up at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com today.
[01:06:36.966 --> 01:06:41.769]  But the point is, people are like, wow, the Pentagon, wow, the British Ministry of Defense, they all predicted this.
[01:06:42.089 --> 01:06:43.170]  Of course they predicted it.
[01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:48.894]  When they got rid of Glass-Steagall 12 years ago, the RAND Corporation said, there's going to be a collapse now.
[01:06:49.214 --> 01:06:50.916]  We're taking over the derivatives.
[01:06:52.030 --> 01:06:53.675]  And the rich are going to dig in.
[01:06:53.695 --> 01:06:54.718]  We'll have mercenaries.
[01:06:55.059 --> 01:06:57.146]  We're going to federalize and militarize police.
[01:06:57.708 --> 01:06:58.089]  It's on!
[01:06:59.246 --> 01:07:00.627]  So that's why we've been here telling you.
[01:07:01.107 --> 01:07:02.827]  They're going to devalue global currencies.
[01:07:02.968 --> 01:07:05.609]  The poor's welfare checks aren't going to go far anymore.
[01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:07.229]  People are going to feel desperate.
[01:07:07.489 --> 01:07:17.333]  They're going to sit there watching TV shows about the rich's yachts and their bling and, you know, the Hollywood people making $100 million a year.
[01:07:17.894 --> 01:07:21.515]  And they're not going to want liberty or freedom or a future.
[01:07:21.895 --> 01:07:25.757]  They're going to want bling or treasure, loot, goodies.
[01:07:27.324 --> 01:07:34.972]  And as the family degenerates, as all this happens, as I've been saying last week, we are going to align into gangs.
[01:07:35.693 --> 01:07:38.896]  Police gangs, black gangs, white gangs, Hispanic gangs.
[01:07:39.477 --> 01:07:40.598]  That's already what's happened.
[01:07:40.638 --> 01:07:43.381]  This is what happens in a Road Warrior scenario.
[01:07:43.401 --> 01:07:47.225]  This is what happens in a Dark Ages type scenario.
[01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:49.546]  And it's happening now.
[01:07:49.986 --> 01:07:56.112]  And the globalists have socially engineered this by design to conquer society.
[01:07:56.172 --> 01:08:01.516]  Now, when they're done, this is just the beginning of years and years of riots, looting, burning.
[01:08:01.896 --> 01:08:03.558]  Every summer is going to be worse than the next.
[01:08:03.898 --> 01:08:08.062]  The depression deepening, the austerity deepening, prices exploding.
[01:08:10.115 --> 01:08:15.979]  Every form of metal being stolen by bands of looters, as we're now seeing all over the world.
[01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:26.726]  Racial attacks in Chicago, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in New York, in Boston, in Miami, in Dallas, in Los Angeles.
[01:08:27.587 --> 01:08:31.390]  American flags can't be flown at many public schools.
[01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:34.832]  Can't wear an American flag shirt, makes the illegal aliens too angry.
[01:08:35.092 --> 01:08:37.754]  They're part of a tribal thing for Mexico.
[01:08:37.794 --> 01:08:38.895]  That's what nationalism is.
[01:08:39.475 --> 01:09:02.267]  If people don't come to America or England and take on the gang of the country, that's how we're designed, nationalism, then we're all at each other's throats, then the bankers who sit above the whole world, dividing and conquering us, will let this scourge burn out society, then come in as the saviors, offering total control, total police state as the answer.
[01:09:03.107 --> 01:09:10.478]  Already Ireland's announced that children must take vaccines to get your tax breaks for having children or to put your kids in school.
[01:09:11.219 --> 01:09:13.182]  All over, total tyranny is coming.
[01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.906]  Paul Watson comments on what Steve was just saying.
[01:09:17.867 --> 01:09:42.107]  Well, related to what you were just covering there, I mean, I wrote an article, several articles in early 2008, again wrote one last year, the one I wrote in June last year said, and this was specifically about the UK, crippling austerity cuts would force the economically deprived to quote, take to the streets with a mindset of nothing to lose if the government handouts they have become dependent on are drastically reduced.
[01:09:42.788 --> 01:09:45.030]  And the system knew this was coming,
[01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:46.831]  They knew they were going to devalue.
[01:09:46.871 --> 01:09:48.852]  Folks are saying, I'm still getting the same welfare.
[01:09:49.432 --> 01:09:50.713]  It's not worth as much.
[01:09:50.813 --> 01:09:53.354]  It doesn't buy as much via inflation.
[01:09:53.594 --> 01:09:56.856]  My grandmother 10 years ago on Social Security could survive.
[01:09:57.156 --> 01:09:58.057]  She can't now.
[01:09:58.417 --> 01:10:03.120]  What's going to happen with gangbangers who aren't well behaved like my 87-year-old grandmother?
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:10.163]  What's going to happen with gangbangers who've been brainwashed by a culture of acting tough and a police force that leaves them alone?
[01:10:10.464 --> 01:10:14.646]  They're going to go wild and feed on people who aren't criminals.
[01:10:14.986 --> 01:10:18.767]  What's going to happen in the UK, Paul, where nobody's got guns to defend themselves?
[01:10:20.528 --> 01:10:24.489]  Well, what's going to happen is an increase of the scenes we've seen over the past few days.
[01:10:24.889 --> 01:10:30.971]  And they knew it was coming because the same thing happened in the 70s when we had the last round of austerity fascism.
[01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:39.433]  The difference between then and now is that we weren't such a rampant consumerist society, whereas then there was less looting because there were less portable
[01:10:39.713 --> 01:10:39.833]  Yeah.
[01:10:54.690 --> 01:10:57.852]  You know who turned around the Los Angeles riots was the Koreans.
[01:10:58.632 --> 01:11:00.573]  The police stood down, as they always do.
[01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:03.195]  Globalist bosses make them do it.
[01:11:03.675 --> 01:11:05.516]  It was the Koreans who finally turned the tide.
[01:11:05.536 --> 01:11:06.917]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:12.801]  If you tried to loot shops here in Austin, you might get to two or three of them, but you'd run to the wrong shop and every one of you would die.
[01:11:13.181 --> 01:11:16.683]  If just a few of these thugs got killed, they would all stop it.
[01:11:17.203 --> 01:11:21.646]  And I'm telling you, none of us are safe if some of these people don't start getting what's coming to them.
[01:11:23.393 --> 01:11:25.215]  Well, it's not just guns, though.
[01:11:25.235 --> 01:11:28.298]  It's generally about broken Britain.
[01:11:28.318 --> 01:11:30.099]  I mean, people don't talk to their neighbours.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:38.427]  If a group of neighbours got together and said, right, we're going to... Because they're raiding off licences and family businesses that have survived two world wars.
[01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:43.892]  So why aren't the neighbours getting together and saying, right, we're going to protect this building tonight, we're going to protect the street?
[01:11:43.973 --> 01:11:46.935]  It's just not happening, because... People are actually doing that now.
[01:11:47.816 --> 01:11:47.996]  Good.
[01:11:49.545 --> 01:11:52.507]  I don't think that's the way to deal with this, though, because it's just going to escalate it.
[01:11:52.527 --> 01:11:55.370]  I mean, people in the communities are coming out and they're trying to
[01:12:10.293 --> 01:12:10.433]  Good!
[01:12:29.634 --> 01:12:30.334]  I don't think so.
[01:12:49.918 --> 01:12:52.539]  They train them to crack heads at G20, though.
[01:12:52.579 --> 01:12:53.879]  They're very proficient at that.
[01:12:54.099 --> 01:12:56.480]  Oh, listen, Steve, tell the story of you and your girlfriend.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:05.982]  I've had it happen to me in England, where they just walk over, give you a clean cut and dress nice, and boss you around the community police, because you're seen as a milk cow, a slave.
[01:13:06.002 --> 01:13:07.822]  They're going to make sure you're properly bowing.
[01:13:09.082 --> 01:13:11.563]  Tell folks what they do to you going out to dinner with your girlfriend.
[01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:14.416]  Well, they just stopped and searched me.
[01:13:14.436 --> 01:13:17.396]  That's what they've been doing for years now.
[01:13:17.816 --> 01:13:28.379]  It's those kind of tactics, in place of proper community policing, that have led to all this kind of social breakdown.
[01:13:28.399 --> 01:13:29.860]  I mean, if they ploughed
[01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:35.379]  Well I know I'm ranting, just the images all over the U.S.
[01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:53.301]  In fact, I forgot to tell the story with one of our crew, with his wife.
[01:13:53.741 --> 01:13:55.182]  These guys were trying to carjack her.
[01:13:55.202 --> 01:13:56.963]  She just pulled her gun out and they ran off.
[01:13:57.623 --> 01:13:59.544]  But the point is, is that this is scary.
[01:13:59.584 --> 01:14:01.225]  And I guess that's why I'm getting all wound up.
[01:14:01.745 --> 01:14:04.587]  At a subconscious level, I want to go ahead and have a fight with these criminals.
[01:14:05.908 --> 01:14:09.049]  Because at an instinctive level, we've got to maintain law and order.
[01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:10.370]  And look at Katrina.
[01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.912]  The military and police wouldn't come help the public.
[01:14:13.232 --> 01:14:18.875]  Then a week later, they came in and went to high and dry areas to loot rich houses and take their guns, Paul, Steve.
[01:14:21.443 --> 01:14:25.587]  Well yeah, I mean Parliament's gonna meet on Thursday for one day.
[01:14:25.647 --> 01:14:37.217]  They've been recalled for the first time in nearly 10 years and they're just gonna pass some draconian piece of legislation that impacts legitimate law-abiding protesters and people going about their business.
[01:14:37.297 --> 01:14:39.259]  Criminals don't obey those kind of laws.
[01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:45.725]  So it's all desire, I mean it's, as I said, it's manipulating both the underclass and the middle
[01:14:45.725 --> 01:14:47.306]  Well you guys need to call for the unthinkable.
[01:14:47.326 --> 01:14:49.687]  The return of your right to keep and bear arms.
[01:14:49.747 --> 01:14:56.772]  It is time for Brits to take control of your government and to hand out the weapons and your crime is going to dissipate overnight.
[01:15:16.127 --> 01:15:23.512]  Believe me, we don't have a lot of home invasions here in Texas compared to like New York or Illinois, because you come in somebody's house around here, you die.
[01:15:24.133 --> 01:15:25.014]  And I'm just telling you.
[01:15:25.514 --> 01:15:36.122]  I mean, it freaks me out to watch people in New York, Chicago, and other areas, wherever the people are liberals, just absolutely being gang raped.
[01:15:36.202 --> 01:15:38.163]  I mean, does it not upset you, Steve?
[01:15:38.463 --> 01:15:39.964]  Steve, what are you going to do if people come to your house?
[01:15:39.984 --> 01:15:40.945]  Are you going to use a butcher knife?
[01:15:41.506 --> 01:15:43.147]  Or I guess you'll try to talk to them?
[01:15:44.796 --> 01:15:46.920]  Well, I don't know what I'm going to do if they come to my house.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.541]  That's the problem.
[01:15:47.601 --> 01:15:51.667]  I think we've gone too far down the line for that.
[01:15:53.010 --> 01:15:56.315]  In theory, that's a good solution, but it's not going to happen.
[01:15:58.183 --> 01:16:02.487]  I think, you know, let's talk about the media hype over this as well.
[01:16:02.507 --> 01:16:03.968]  Alright, let's come back and do that.
[01:16:04.108 --> 01:16:09.973]  Listen, I want you to get to the sporting goods stores and start buying baseball bats.
[01:16:10.673 --> 01:16:14.856]  And what you do is you get some nails and you hammer them through all over with a nice big trudgeon.
[01:16:16.077 --> 01:16:18.319]  And you want to get two of those because you might break one.
[01:16:18.619 --> 01:16:21.962]  That's the first couple people you whack when they assault you.
[01:16:22.182 --> 01:16:25.125]  Somebody comes in your castle, you know what to do to them.
[01:16:25.685 --> 01:16:26.586]  Get fired up!
[01:16:29.878 --> 01:16:41.428]  From the shattered Rust Belt come The Lost Vegas.

[01:17:46.295 --> 01:17:47.376]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:17:47.556 --> 01:17:51.919]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:17:52.099 --> 01:17:57.823]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:17:57.903 --> 01:18:01.325]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:18:04.267 --> 01:18:09.190]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[01:18:16.475 --> 01:18:17.656]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:18:17.917 --> 01:18:28.346]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[01:18:28.566 --> 01:18:31.869]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the
[01:18:31.909 --> 01:18:32.269]  I don't know.
[01:18:54.445 --> 01:18:54.845]  We're good to go.
[01:19:16.696 --> 01:19:17.197]  Question.
[01:19:17.537 --> 01:19:21.461]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[01:19:22.121 --> 01:19:27.546]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[01:19:27.827 --> 01:19:33.292]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:38.457]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[01:19:38.757 --> 01:19:44.778]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[01:19:45.238 --> 01:19:51.739]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.240]  Who has access to it?
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.720]  How is it being used?
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:58.061]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:05.002]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[01:20:05.442 --> 01:20:10.364]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[01:20:10.724 --> 01:20:12.385]  America's new slavery.
[01:20:12.825 --> 01:20:15.026]  All Americans should be concerned.
[01:20:15.046 --> 01:20:31.113]  Folks, it is a fundamental instinct that I have.
[01:20:31.894 --> 01:20:34.295]  When I see criminals, whether they be police,
[01:20:36.215 --> 01:20:45.460]  North Korean Commissars, the Ku Klux Klan, black racists, whoever they are, feeding on defenseless people.
[01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.781]  Remember Reginald Denny, truck driver?
[01:20:47.801 --> 01:20:51.964]  They pull him out and beat his face in with a brick until he basically has no face.
[01:20:51.984 --> 01:20:53.965]  I mean, that is horrible.
[01:20:54.105 --> 01:20:57.747]  And just because Reginald Denny's white doesn't mean he deserves that.
[01:20:58.207 --> 01:21:01.049]  And whether it's groups of white thugs that are doing this,
[01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:07.328]  Black thugs, whatever, they all need to be punished, and the British government will not punish them.
[01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:13.093]  Because governments let violent offenders go, and then they keep non-violent in prison.
[01:21:13.133 --> 01:21:14.515]  That's the globalist model.
[01:21:15.195 --> 01:21:22.462]  Now, talking about how the media is spinning this, yes, they're saying we need TSA pat-downs everywhere, as if that will keep anyone safe.
[01:21:22.742 --> 01:21:25.245]  You can't keep knives away from criminals in a prison.
[01:21:25.865 --> 01:21:29.369]  The only answer is for the people to have a right to defend themselves.
[01:21:29.409 --> 01:21:34.854]  And Steve, you said you're getting intel that folks are banding together and defending their shops.
[01:21:34.914 --> 01:21:35.575]  That's good.
[01:21:36.576 --> 01:21:45.445]  Because as soon as that happens, and as soon as somebody comes in one of these shops and gets their heads clubbed in, you're going to start seeing the criminals have the fear of God in them, Steve.
[01:21:46.803 --> 01:22:05.056]  Yeah, I mean, there's been some announcements on Twitter and stuff that people in certain areas have heard that they're next, you know, their area's being targeted next, so they're trying to organise themselves on Twitter to get prepared for it to, you know, all come outside, not stay inside sort of cowering, which is what all the police
[01:22:05.843 --> 01:22:13.129]  Now, what about the cases of famous, even famous people get assaulted, they're being stabbed, they fight back and the police go ahead and arrest them?
[01:22:13.409 --> 01:22:22.316]  Or the guy who'd been robbed three times and finally got an old shotgun and shot one of the guys and then he, and the guy that defended himself in his house being attacked, he went to prison?
[01:22:24.038 --> 01:22:25.579]  Yeah, there's loads of stories like that.
[01:22:26.119 --> 01:22:30.683]  I mean, I don't know how it's gonna go down if people all, you know, people all come out together.
[01:22:30.843 --> 01:22:33.185]  You know, the law-abiding people all come out together.
[01:22:33.205 --> 01:22:34.186]  I don't know how they're gonna
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.341]  I think it's a bit of both.
[01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:15.327]  You know, as I said, there aren't any senior police there, so the police that are there are thinking, well, my seniors don't seem to care about this, so why should I?
[01:23:15.547 --> 01:23:29.956]  And also, I think they have been ordered to, in the weight of the media coverage and the hype around the heavy-handed tactics that we've seen in London recently, they have been ordered to stand back a little bit, but obviously this is a very different situation.
[01:23:29.976 --> 01:23:30.937]  These are not legitimate protests.
[01:23:31.517 --> 01:23:39.939]  Yeah, but stand back when thugs are doing stuff but then they routinely beat peaceful protesters to death or a guy delivering newspapers at G20?
[01:23:39.959 --> 01:23:41.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:43.120]  But I think they're different sets of police.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:49.982]  I think the police in the suburbs of London are not, you know, they're not the riot police that you see at the G20 cracking heads.
[01:23:50.502 --> 01:23:52.563]  They're not even trained as riot police.
[01:23:52.583 --> 01:23:57.024]  They're just normal police that normally are just out and about walking, you know, on the beat.
[01:23:57.825 --> 01:24:03.049]  They're thinking, you know, it's not my job to go in there and crack heads, and I'm not going to do it.
[01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:07.473]  But how could you control yourself watching people being drug out of cars?
[01:24:07.894 --> 01:24:10.656]  I'm not a cop, and I'm going to tell you right now, and I'm not a tough guy either.
[01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.598]  But if I see innocent people being attacked, I go into action.
[01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:20.064]  And I don't understand people that don't have an instinct to want to stomp criminals into the ground.
[01:24:21.072 --> 01:24:23.694]  Yeah, they need to arm the firemen right now.
[01:24:23.714 --> 01:24:24.615]  I mean, this is asinine.
[01:24:24.635 --> 01:24:27.016]  That's like in the LA riots, shooting firemen.
[01:24:27.036 --> 01:24:27.737]  I mean, I just...
[01:24:48.351 --> 01:24:49.192]  It is insane.
[01:24:49.872 --> 01:24:54.195]  And then it only hurts those communities because the businesses don't generally come back into the area.
[01:24:55.896 --> 01:24:56.796]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:56.836 --> 01:25:01.459]  I mean, and then you've got people saying, well, you know, these drugs are saying, well, it's their fault.
[01:25:01.499 --> 01:25:02.740]  You know, they're the businesses.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:03.860]  They're the rich people.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:04.781]  We don't have any jobs.
[01:25:05.541 --> 01:25:15.987]  And it all goes back to this sort of deep social unrest that's been cemented over these years by governments on both sides of the political spectrum in this country.
[01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:28.560]  Well, Paul brought it up that it's mainly family shops, and in England, for those that don't know, there's thousands of shops in London that are, some of them are 200, 300 years old, that have been handed down, and some of them aren't going to be coming back now, and just little family shops.
[01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:30.602]  We'll continue to cover this.
[01:25:30.662 --> 01:25:31.823]  Financial news coming up.
[01:25:31.843 --> 01:25:40.109]  We've also got Stuart Rose joining us, because our government's busy demonizing conservatives, libertarians, patriots, instead of all the roving gangs we've got here.
[01:25:40.409 --> 01:25:42.111]  Paul Watson, any final comments?
[01:25:43.226 --> 01:25:48.888]  Yeah, the rebels should now, the looters should be recognized as the new legitimate government of the United Kingdom.
[01:25:48.948 --> 01:25:52.589]  David Cameron should step down according to the example that they've set in Libya.
[01:25:54.110 --> 01:26:01.293]  Well there, that's Al-Qaeda looters and they are being handed the bank accounts of the Libyan government and their property in England.
[01:26:01.773 --> 01:26:03.593]  And so actually, that's probably what should happen.
[01:26:03.653 --> 01:26:06.254]  NATO should now invade England and give the looters control.
[01:26:07.335 --> 01:26:08.235]  We're on the march.
[01:26:08.735 --> 01:26:10.216]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:11.261 --> 01:26:14.083]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:17.366 --> 01:26:22.810]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:31.256]  But if the unfortunate diamond gusset chains, they sow pride in every stitch.
[01:26:33.097 --> 01:26:35.179]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:26:37.506 --> 01:26:41.368]  Put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:45.251]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:26:45.931 --> 01:26:46.772]  Others don't.
[01:26:47.172 --> 01:26:49.053]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:26:49.313 --> 01:26:50.814]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:26:51.094 --> 01:26:53.656]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:26:53.976 --> 01:27:00.240]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:02.821]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:27:03.302 --> 01:27:05.343]  Diamond gusset jeans got it.
[01:27:05.683 --> 01:27:06.183]  Others don't.
[01:27:07.950 --> 01:27:11.091]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:27:11.891 --> 01:27:12.851]  Tyranny is here.
[01:27:13.151 --> 01:27:17.072]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:27:17.092 --> 01:27:19.293]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:27:19.313 --> 01:27:24.774]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:31.416]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:27:31.856 --> 01:27:37.401]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:27:37.802 --> 01:27:41.505]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:27:42.025 --> 01:27:45.989]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:27:46.309 --> 01:27:51.814]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:27:52.254 --> 01:27:55.217]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:27:55.797 --> 01:27:57.239]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:27:57.779 --> 01:27:58.220]  It's here.

[01:28:15.867 --> 01:28:23.370]  To celebrate, eFoodsDirect.com is offering the lowest price ever on their one-year Freedom Food Supply, even less than the price in
[01:28:23.490 --> 01:28:23.930]  We're good to go.

[01:28:47.841 --> 01:28:50.163]  If you have ever considered getting a supply, now is the time.
[01:28:50.183 --> 01:28:50.564]  Call 800-409-5633.
[01:28:50.604 --> 01:28:52.985]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[01:29:16.778 --> 01:29:19.541]  Get out!
[01:29:23.044 --> 01:29:25.066]  Eat your ass!
[01:29:25.086 --> 01:29:28.750]  That's just what the people wanted!
[01:29:36.977 --> 01:29:38.779]  Eject from the prison planet.
[01:29:38.799 --> 01:29:40.360]  We're trying to get the planet back.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:49.147]  We're trying to get the spirit of liberty to awaken instead of the spirit of tyranny to spread like a dark cancer across the globe.
[01:29:49.647 --> 01:29:52.249]  Here is the Washington Times Philadelphia mayor.
[01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:56.193]  Talks tough to black teenagers after flash mobs.
[01:29:57.253 --> 01:30:01.116]  The mayor, who reportedly is black-tolled, marauding black youths, you have damaged
[01:30:02.082 --> 01:30:09.164]  Your own race imposing a tougher curfew Monday in response to the latest flash mobs, crimes, racial attacks.
[01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:12.204]  It's happening in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, day after day.
[01:30:12.664 --> 01:30:18.206]  Chicago has been going on for three months with the new mob boss up there, Emmanuel, covering it up.
[01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:20.006]  It's happening in Los Angeles.
[01:30:20.726 --> 01:30:22.667]  It started in England as racial attacks.
[01:30:22.727 --> 01:30:28.108]  Now it's groups of white hoodlums running around in smaller cities, torching and burning and robbing.
[01:30:28.968 --> 01:30:29.629]  Predominantly.
[01:30:30.209 --> 01:30:32.651]  In London it is predominantly, quote, minorities.
[01:30:33.392 --> 01:30:38.916]  But it is this politically correct idea that it's okay to do this type stuff.
[01:30:39.777 --> 01:30:41.959]  And we're breaking down more and more into tribalism.
[01:30:42.039 --> 01:30:44.461]  It's very, very frightening.
[01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:47.623]  And it's going to be used to take law-abiding citizens' rights.
[01:30:48.084 --> 01:30:51.627]  The answer is the general public being armed.
[01:30:52.327 --> 01:30:56.911]  You go to where all these riots are happening, it's everywhere the public is disarmed.
[01:30:57.251 --> 01:31:03.636]  And people know that they're domesticated, liberal populations who will not even physically fight back.
[01:31:04.197 --> 01:31:09.641]  Watching these Brits in these videos, they just basically get down on their hands and knees and allow themselves to be beaten.
[01:31:10.642 --> 01:31:13.164]  It is absolutely pathetic.
[01:31:14.005 --> 01:31:14.446]  Pathetic.
[01:31:14.626 --> 01:31:19.410]  Any red-blooded man does not want to get in a fight, but once it starts, it's enjoyable.
[01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:21.131]  And I don't understand.
[01:31:21.191 --> 01:31:23.133]  It's one of the biggest thrills there is out there.
[01:31:23.673 --> 01:31:25.135]  To crush scum's skulls.
[01:31:25.635 --> 01:31:26.436]  I need to stop.
[01:31:26.456 --> 01:31:27.076]  I need to stop.
[01:31:27.377 --> 01:31:29.899]  At a very primitive level, folks, I get angry.
[01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:40.248]  And I don't like it, and I know that we're going bankrupt, and world government is coming in like a flood, and we've told you there's going to be global disorder.
[01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:55.240]  We read to you the different Pentagon reports back in 2007, the British Ministry of Defense reports, where they said because of derivatives, they were going to have to devalue currencies to pay it off, and that this would cause the underclasses to start going absolutely wild.
[01:31:56.021 --> 01:31:56.941]  And we've covered that.
[01:31:57.802 --> 01:31:59.483]  And it's only going to get worse.
[01:32:00.063 --> 01:32:03.044]  It is only going to get more insane.
[01:32:03.604 --> 01:32:04.964]  Now, here's CBC.
[01:32:05.084 --> 01:32:08.646]  Gold may hit $2,500 in 2011, J.P.
[01:32:08.706 --> 01:32:09.046]  Morgan.
[01:32:09.526 --> 01:32:16.648]  And actually reading from MSNBC, they said it will go to $2,500 or higher by year-end.
[01:32:16.688 --> 01:32:21.790]  That is their prime projection on very high volatility following the downgrade of U.S.
[01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:22.110]  debt.
[01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:24.651]  And they go on here in the report.
[01:32:26.138 --> 01:32:31.521]  Uh, to say that this is because of inflation, rising inflation, weakness in the U.S.
[01:32:31.581 --> 01:32:39.865]  dollar, and it goes on to say that they expect other commodities to also explode in prices.
[01:32:40.425 --> 01:32:42.587]  This is elementary information.
[01:32:43.287 --> 01:32:47.789]  And finally, we're starting to see admissions of what's going on.
[01:32:47.829 --> 01:32:52.632]  Now, that said, I did a special report, 7 o'clock last night,
[01:32:54.113 --> 01:32:56.435]  And we're going to have more special reports in the coming nights.
[01:32:56.996 --> 01:32:59.858]  These are InfoWars.com special reports.
[01:33:00.479 --> 01:33:02.861]  Some will be 10 minutes, some an hour, some two hours.
[01:33:03.381 --> 01:33:09.506]  I did an hour report last week, a two-hour special report with Sheriff Richard Mack in studio and Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[01:33:10.047 --> 01:33:13.269]  We did one last week with Gerald Cilente for an hour.
[01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:16.472]  Those are all at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:17.253 --> 01:33:18.694]  We also stream them out live.
[01:33:19.395 --> 01:33:29.245]  But starting September 1st, on that Thursday, we have a 30-minute show every night at 7 that's going to be absolutely condensed and power-packed with graphics, documents, video clips.
[01:33:30.246 --> 01:33:35.070]  And we're building this 21st century network today.
[01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:47.174]  And we started building Tomorrow's Network ten years ago, and we finally, through years of support and slowly growing, have now reached the point where we're reaching millions of new people a week, conservatively.
[01:33:47.654 --> 01:33:50.455]  Millions new a week, just on YouTube, one format.
[01:33:51.215 --> 01:33:59.957]  If I told you the real projections we've got of actually how many folks we're reaching, I'm sure the government knows, but it is a daunting, incredible number, and it's a great responsibility.
[01:34:00.905 --> 01:34:05.188]  But the point is, we've got to up our attack on the globalists 110%.
[01:34:05.568 --> 01:34:15.456]  We cannot do it without you buying the new camouflage, InfoWars, Don't Tread on Me hat, or buying Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic, Endgame.
[01:34:17.657 --> 01:34:19.699]  Big Brother or William Nightmare Come True book.
[01:34:20.519 --> 01:34:28.645]  We can't do it without you visiting the online video slash apparel store at InfoWars.com and buying war bonds in the Battle for the Republic.
[01:34:28.926 --> 01:34:32.088]  Plus then you get books, videos and tools to show and give others.
[01:34:32.609 --> 01:34:36.091]  They're also very well made and very well documented to up your level of knowledge.
[01:34:37.172 --> 01:34:37.993]  None of us know everything.
[01:34:38.633 --> 01:34:40.915]  So, InfoWars.com, please support us.
[01:34:40.955 --> 01:34:43.396]  Get your PrisonPlanet.tv memberships.
[01:34:43.476 --> 01:34:53.123]  We are pouring our backup reserves into the new studio, the new production, the special reports, the nightly show, trying to hire reporters.
[01:34:53.763 --> 01:34:56.305]  Hiring new writers, bringing people on board.
[01:34:56.946 --> 01:34:59.788]  Many nights now we're working till 10, 11 or midnight.
[01:35:00.288 --> 01:35:08.155]  Many days my children beg me to come home and I tell them, sorry I can't because we are going all in because we understand the globalist program.
[01:35:08.455 --> 01:35:09.255]  We are aware of it.
[01:35:09.316 --> 01:35:10.977]  Now, I want to play this clip.
[01:35:10.997 --> 01:35:15.340]  We're going to Stuart Rhodes until five minutes into the next hour, maybe a little bit longer.
[01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:17.962]  Founder of Oath Keepers, great patriot.
[01:35:18.823 --> 01:35:25.193]  Constitutional lawyer, paratrooper, veteran, Ron Paul, staffer.
[01:35:26.516 --> 01:35:35.184]  To break down some incredible developments on the Super Congress, courtside, these riots, the stealth gun control by Fiat outside of law.
[01:35:35.584 --> 01:35:37.386]  But first, I want to play you a clip.
[01:35:37.646 --> 01:35:41.970]  And I put this in the special report last night, and I had trouble dealing with it mentally.
[01:35:42.371 --> 01:35:47.695]  Because it's so naked, it's so open, it's so arrogant, it's so in your face.
[01:35:47.816 --> 01:35:49.037]  Greenspan giggling.
[01:35:50.328 --> 01:36:03.136]  And they've got Goolsby, the globalist Skull and Bones member who just left the Obama administration, looks at him and can't believe that this was said on Meet the Prostitutes.
[01:36:03.956 --> 01:36:06.317]  Meet the Prostitutes to the Globalist.
[01:36:06.818 --> 01:36:11.881]  Greenspan says it is impossible for us to default because we will just print more money.
[01:36:12.981 --> 01:36:19.005]  That is a technical default through inflation and signals a Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe,
[01:36:20.399 --> 01:36:23.340]  Mexican peso type scenario.
[01:36:23.841 --> 01:36:30.223]  It is so incredible to see something like that said, and it lets you know what they're planning.
[01:36:31.184 --> 01:36:31.484]  Okay?
[01:36:32.004 --> 01:36:36.106]  And again, they're hyperinflating to pay off the derivatives they created that we don't owe.
[01:36:37.166 --> 01:36:39.247]  And the fact that they would flaunt this.
[01:36:39.267 --> 01:36:47.991]  Now remember, just a few months ago, Geithner said on the same Prestitute Show, on Meet the Prestitutes, Meet the Press, he said that we will not lose our AAA rating.
[01:36:49.835 --> 01:36:53.238]  So they are maneuvering us into total collapse.
[01:36:53.638 --> 01:37:09.709]  Now here is Alan Greenspan, who got rid of the Glass-Steagall Act, who brought us to where we are now, an arch-criminal, who told Laird NewsHour that he is above the law two years ago, telling you that it's impossible to default because they'll just print money.
[01:37:10.230 --> 01:37:11.571]  What will that do to your paycheck?
[01:37:11.811 --> 01:37:13.672]  Destroy its spending power, its buying power.
[01:37:13.913 --> 01:37:15.634]  What will it do to fixed income, Social Security?
[01:37:15.794 --> 01:37:16.755]  It will destroy us.
[01:37:17.395 --> 01:37:20.516]  This is how societies are destroyed.
[01:37:20.696 --> 01:37:21.697]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[01:37:22.197 --> 01:37:22.817]  Are U.S.
[01:37:22.917 --> 01:37:26.178]  Treasury bonds still safe to invest in?
[01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:27.679]  Very much so.
[01:37:27.859 --> 01:37:32.960]  I think there's a... This is not an issue of credit rating.
[01:37:33.781 --> 01:37:40.243]  The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that.
[01:37:40.823 --> 01:37:44.144]  So there is zero probability of default.
[01:37:46.721 --> 01:38:00.948]  And Goolsbee, the former Obama advisor sitting there with him, cannot believe, if you're not watching PrisonPlanet.tv, Kurt Neumann wrote an article about it yesterday titled, what Greenspan says, you know, hyperinflation of currency.
[01:38:02.529 --> 01:38:02.589]  Is
[01:38:18.228 --> 01:38:19.150]  Your take on that.
[01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:21.133]  He's the founder and director of Oath Keepers.
[01:38:21.173 --> 01:38:22.154]  He served as a U.S.
[01:38:22.314 --> 01:38:26.741]  Army paratrooper until disabled through a rough terrain parachuting accident during a night jump.
[01:38:27.222 --> 01:38:31.048]  He is a former firearms instructor and former member of Representative Ron Paul's D.C.
[01:38:31.088 --> 01:38:31.348]  staff.
[01:38:33.451 --> 01:38:35.913]  The Monthly Enemy at the Gates column for SWAT Magazine.
[01:38:36.254 --> 01:38:45.621]  Stewart graduated from Yale Law School in 2004, where his paper, Solving the Puzzle of Enemy Combatant Status, won Yale's Miller Prize for Best Paper on the Bill of Rights.
[01:38:46.102 --> 01:38:47.763]  He assisted teaching U.S.
[01:38:47.803 --> 01:38:54.609]  military history at Yale, was a Yale Research Scholar, and is writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people.
[01:38:54.969 --> 01:38:59.313]  Oathkeepers.net is, of course, his greatest accomplishment, in my humble opinion.
[01:38:59.653 --> 01:39:01.174]  Stuart, great to have you here with us.
[01:39:02.335 --> 01:39:09.240]  Everything we foretold knowing history is now unfolding, and we have just begun the plunge into tyranny, my friend.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.084]  So it's now, as you said, time for all of us to girt ourselves in defense of civilization.
[01:39:16.573 --> 01:39:17.093]  Absolutely.
[01:39:17.133 --> 01:39:21.256]  I mean, we're heading down the same path as the Weimar Republic in Germany in the 1920s.
[01:39:21.777 --> 01:39:23.758]  And I guess he's technically correct.
[01:39:23.998 --> 01:39:30.262]  They just keep on printing money to pay their debt, but that'll only go on until the dollar is worthless.
[01:39:30.943 --> 01:39:38.668]  Until, just like in Germany, you have dollars being thrown in the streets, and people stealing the bags the dollars are in, rather than the dollars themselves.
[01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:39.692]  I think so.
[01:39:58.348 --> 01:40:08.772]  And that's why the Feds have now issued public papers in the Von Notaus case and others saying alternative currencies are terrorism and we will be infiltrated and destroyed.
[01:40:08.812 --> 01:40:09.552]  Those are quotes.
[01:40:10.013 --> 01:40:13.514]  So now doing something totally legal, we're being told we're terrorists.
[01:40:14.771 --> 01:40:17.092]  Right, and that's why you want to do it like a swarm of bees.
[01:40:17.112 --> 01:40:25.214]  You want to be thousands and millions of people doing it themselves in small individual transactions rather than one guy having a big warehouse full of silver.
[01:40:25.534 --> 01:40:26.594]  That was his big mistake.
[01:40:26.614 --> 01:40:27.935]  It was very easy to take down.
[01:40:28.475 --> 01:40:34.076]  So you do it quietly among yourselves with barter and with using gold and silver in private exchanges.
[01:40:34.156 --> 01:40:35.797]  They can't possibly regulate all that.
[01:40:35.817 --> 01:40:36.737]  It's impossible.
[01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:39.312]  OK, Stuart, let's continue there.
[01:40:40.112 --> 01:40:47.115]  I mean, chronicling the 10 orders you will never follow, saying that you will keep your oath.
[01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:52.177]  I remember you were here years ago, but just a few months ago saying, get ready for the collapse.
[01:40:52.617 --> 01:40:53.377]  Everybody get ready.
[01:40:53.397 --> 01:40:55.118]  Because you're a historian.
[01:40:55.138 --> 01:40:56.579]  You've won awards at Yale.
[01:40:57.319 --> 01:40:59.520]  And, you know, for being a historian.
[01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:02.981]  If you know history, you know exactly what road we're on.
[01:41:03.001 --> 01:41:12.385]  And now here we are, and the government is now rolling out that Homeland Security is for the gun owners, the veterans, the libertarians, the people that want to end the Fed.
[01:41:12.425 --> 01:41:19.288]  It's now out again today that the Pentagon is surveilling in the Fedders, is surveilling Oath Keepers, Ron Paul.
[01:41:19.608 --> 01:41:23.690]  They know that we know that they're the criminals, and they're coming after us.
[01:41:25.177 --> 01:41:27.178]  Well sure, we're the threat to what they want to do next.
[01:41:27.218 --> 01:41:32.921]  What they want is a collapse where the American people are desperate and hungry and will accept anything.
[01:41:32.941 --> 01:41:35.822]  And the solution is going to be a worldwide version of a Fed.
[01:41:36.322 --> 01:41:41.725]  And so, you know, the people who are not going to buy into that, who are striking at the root and striking at the heart of the beast,
[01:41:42.365 --> 01:41:43.205]  We're good to go.
[01:42:07.879 --> 01:42:08.520]  Absolutely.
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:18.967]  I mean, if England had posse's, and that's where posse started for folks that don't know over a thousand years ago, if they had a posse, you wouldn't have any of this crime going on right now.
[01:42:19.067 --> 01:42:22.690]  It's the same thing where the looting and rioting is starting up here in the U.S.
[01:42:22.990 --> 01:42:24.531]  and the media is trying to keep it quiet.
[01:42:26.032 --> 01:42:30.555]  Right, and you're not going to see that kind of looting and rioting going on in rural areas where folks are well armed.
[01:42:31.015 --> 01:42:31.776]  It just won't happen.
[01:42:32.236 --> 01:42:37.260]  You're going to see it in the cities where they've all been, you know, eurocide and it turned into European.
[01:42:39.784 --> 01:42:40.304]  Incredible.
[01:42:40.344 --> 01:42:43.085]  What do you make of the Super Congress?
[01:42:44.065 --> 01:42:45.686]  What's your view of that monstrosity?
[01:42:46.706 --> 01:42:52.547]  Well, I think it's basically, it's our version of the Enabling Act, or something similar.
[01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:59.349]  It's an absolute destruction of Republican form of government that the Constitution guarantees us.
[01:43:00.049 --> 01:43:03.110]  And so I think our response should be a scorched earth policy.
[01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:06.412]  Of voting out of office anyone who voted for it.
[01:43:06.933 --> 01:43:09.114]  Voting out of office anyone who dares to sit on it.
[01:43:09.495 --> 01:43:13.058]  And voting out of office anybody who dares to vote for anything that comes out of it.
[01:43:13.078 --> 01:43:15.560]  It should just be the third rail they can't touch.
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.161]  And it's up to us to do that.
[01:43:17.181 --> 01:43:21.244]  If we don't do that, then we're telling them that we'll accept anything.
[01:43:21.704 --> 01:43:23.146]  So it's not Congress.
[01:43:23.526 --> 01:43:29.791]  The President has the power to raise the national debt on his own under this new law.
[01:43:30.491 --> 01:43:30.972]  I don't know.
[01:43:46.406 --> 01:43:47.066]  We're good to go.
[01:44:12.154 --> 01:44:12.434]  I think so.
[01:44:36.611 --> 01:44:39.513]  And it's happening with a whimper, not a bang.
[01:44:39.933 --> 01:44:42.054]  This is definitely not just a new committee.
[01:44:42.834 --> 01:44:45.776]  The spending bills will now originate out of this committee.
[01:44:46.336 --> 01:44:47.937]  Reid says it affects all bills.
[01:44:48.638 --> 01:44:51.459]  We've seen the president launch wars without any congressional approval.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:56.782]  We're seeing the ATF launching new gun regulations outside of law.
[01:44:57.002 --> 01:44:58.423]  The NRA is suing him over that.
[01:44:58.863 --> 01:45:03.906]  We're seeing a mad rush for government to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants.
[01:45:05.749 --> 01:45:06.130]  I think so.
[01:45:23.548 --> 01:45:25.310]  Because Congress is not doing their responsibility.
[01:45:25.650 --> 01:45:26.631]  He even ignored that.
[01:45:26.651 --> 01:45:30.774]  He pretended like he's the president of the world, and he went to the World Congress, to the UN.
[01:45:31.155 --> 01:45:32.315]  That's his behavior pattern.
[01:45:32.716 --> 01:45:33.877]  And now it's the same kind of thing.
[01:45:33.897 --> 01:45:37.240]  He doesn't like those pesky freshmen in the Republican Party.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:38.521]  Some of them are actually doing some good.
[01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:40.702]  He doesn't like Graham Paul, certainly.
[01:45:40.722 --> 01:45:44.105]  And so the answer is, well, we'll just go someplace else for the authorities.
[01:45:44.466 --> 01:45:45.506]  We'll create something new.
[01:45:45.967 --> 01:45:48.449]  And we'll call it, you know, democracy.
[01:45:48.959 --> 01:46:06.080]  And then instead of the bills being introduced in the House by individual members and having filibuster and amendments... They originated in this super congress and then the House is only allowed to vote up or down on it.
[01:46:06.641 --> 01:46:09.583]  They're neutered, they're muzzled, they're silenced.
[01:46:10.004 --> 01:46:14.307]  There's no filibuster, there's no debate, no chance for amendment, just up or down.
[01:46:14.567 --> 01:46:19.231]  But that's why every member of Congress should vote no on anything that comes out of that.
[01:46:19.531 --> 01:46:23.975]  I don't care what it is, I don't care how nice it is, how wonderful it might be, they should vote no.
[01:46:24.395 --> 01:46:26.837]  Because it's a destruction of their responsibility.
[01:46:27.217 --> 01:46:32.041]  And they should be like Ron Paul and draw a line in the sand on constitutionality first.
[01:46:32.461 --> 01:46:33.963]  Doesn't make a difference how good the bill is.
[01:46:34.023 --> 01:46:39.670]  If it's unconstitutional, because it comes out of a body that's nowhere in our Constitution, they must vote against it.
[01:46:40.031 --> 01:46:41.753]  If they vote for it, they need to go.
[01:46:41.773 --> 01:46:45.838]  They don't know their oath, they don't know the Constitution, they're violating their oath, they need to go.
[01:46:46.219 --> 01:46:47.500]  That should be the response of the American people.
[01:46:49.855 --> 01:46:52.276]  Alright, let's look at a microcosm of tyranny.
[01:46:52.336 --> 01:47:00.521]  A court site, and the police chief in front of witnesses in a meeting, reportedly saying that you are a terrorist.
[01:47:00.981 --> 01:47:03.343]  We'll be right back with the wicked Stuart Rhodes.
[01:47:03.443 --> 01:47:05.184]  I'm the wicked one as well, Alex Jones.

[01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:43.395]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:47:43.575 --> 01:47:49.303]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:47:49.383 --> 01:47:52.767]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:50:20.482 --> 01:50:23.144]  We are riders on the storm.
[01:50:23.164 --> 01:50:32.870]  An engineered global financial collapse out of which the social engineers want to create a collectivist eugenics world government.
[01:50:33.551 --> 01:50:34.792]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest.
[01:50:34.992 --> 01:50:37.394]  The reason I wanted to get Stuart on a few days ago and we have him now
[01:50:38.434 --> 01:50:58.474]  Is because I saw your press release at Oath Keepers, we posted it at InfoWars.com as well, but it was also at OathKeepers.net, where the king of courtside, the police chief, who the council fired the mayor and most of the police, has declared you and others as terrorists.
[01:51:00.526 --> 01:51:01.126]  Yeah, he did.
[01:51:01.206 --> 01:51:02.666]  He referred to us.
[01:51:02.686 --> 01:51:13.209]  We're holding a rally on August 27th there in support of the Courtside 10, the 10 stand-up police officers who refused his unlawful orders and blew the whistle on him.
[01:51:13.789 --> 01:51:23.731]  And he responded to that by saying that some of the writers, oath keepers, and the Tea Party of Phoenix are, he referred to us as domestic terrorists.
[01:51:24.657 --> 01:51:26.879]  And he said he called the FBI to report us.
[01:51:27.500 --> 01:51:48.801]  And this is something he's been using in his playbook now for many months, trying to scare people by raising the specter of the Guilford shooting and making allegations that people in town who are liberty and freedom fighters have the same mindset as the shooter there, or the same mindset as someone who would use violence.
[01:51:49.381 --> 01:51:57.623]  I mean it's incredible that at a city council meeting in front of witnesses he would say that now people's First Amendment is a terrorist action.
[01:52:11.892 --> 01:52:13.032]  Well, that's what they do.
[01:52:13.072 --> 01:52:13.793]  They demonize.
[01:52:13.833 --> 01:52:21.095]  This is the same playbook as the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and DHS, which Southern Poverty Law Center is now part of.
[01:52:21.135 --> 01:52:27.638]  They're on the advisory panel for DHS, is to make allegations that people who talk that way
[01:52:28.358 --> 01:52:28.799]  I think so.
[01:52:43.568 --> 01:52:44.169]  I don't know.
[01:53:00.843 --> 01:53:06.510]  Well, that's the new rollout, Stuart, and I guarantee you, I've seen this rollout now in the last year intensifying.
[01:53:07.191 --> 01:53:14.660]  They're intensifying it ahead of staging events or provocateuring them to blame on us and then have a big national guilt fest.
[01:53:14.680 --> 01:53:17.444]  Do you agree that these are frightening storm clouds?
[01:53:18.564 --> 01:53:31.051]  Absolutely, and this is the problem with the economic collapse around the corner, is that, you know, if we're unprepared, they're going to capitalize on the social disruptions and the riots, and they'll use that as an excuse for declaring martial law.
[01:53:31.431 --> 01:53:35.414]  And, you know, their answer is always, with a set-aside normal procedure.
[01:53:35.814 --> 01:53:41.397]  Even in this town council, they declare a state of emergency, and so they have to stop having public meetings.
[01:53:41.417 --> 01:53:44.159]  It's a total violation of state law, the open meetings law.
[01:53:44.519 --> 01:53:46.020]  They start having closed meetings.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:47.841]  I don't know.
[01:54:07.959 --> 01:54:20.228]  Just like they blamed S&T for the downgrade, don't blame the riots on you pesky constitutionalists out there who are interfering with the National Guard and FEMA and NORTHCOM doing their job.
[01:54:20.568 --> 01:54:25.171]  So you people need to shut up, disarm, like in Katrina, and just get in line for the camps.
[01:54:26.650 --> 01:54:27.311]  Absolutely.
[01:54:27.331 --> 01:54:39.424]  Stuart, do five more minutes with us and then we are going to get into some of the other financial news and then Mark Moreno with some good news is joining us.
[01:54:41.827 --> 01:54:43.148]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:54:50.302 --> 01:54:51.463]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:54:51.483 --> 01:54:58.149]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:54:58.410 --> 01:55:00.692]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:55:00.972 --> 01:55:06.177]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:55:06.357 --> 01:55:09.119]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:11.522]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:55:11.702 --> 01:55:15.025]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.
[01:55:15.225 --> 01:55:17.626]  And America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:55:17.946 --> 01:55:21.147]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:55:21.327 --> 01:55:26.849]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:55:27.089 --> 01:55:28.409]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:29.910]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:32.571]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:55:32.711 --> 01:55:36.752]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:55:36.932 --> 01:55:39.553]  You can find the video at www.barron.com.

[01:56:12.927 --> 01:56:16.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:21.211]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:56:21.311 --> 01:56:30.416]  You know, I've been talking all day about Brits need to get out and buy as many aluminum baseball bats or wooden baseball bats as they can.
[01:56:31.297 --> 01:56:33.738]  And Drudge Report, always on target,
[01:56:35.365 --> 01:56:36.706]  I bet Drudge is listening.
[01:56:37.346 --> 01:56:38.747]  He's smarter than I am in a lot of ways.
[01:56:38.787 --> 01:56:39.928]  I bet he thought of it himself, too.
[01:56:39.968 --> 01:56:54.735]  But went and checked Amazon, and sure enough, Movers and Shakers and Sports and Leisure, Little Collapsible Nightsticks, are up in sales to the number one sales item in sports to $7,250.
[01:56:57.917 --> 01:56:58.558]  29 times.
[01:56:59.078 --> 01:57:03.923]  So its ranking is up 7,029 times from what it was.
[01:57:04.383 --> 01:57:09.508]  Number two is a aluminum baseball bat, silver, 60 centimeters.
[01:57:10.348 --> 01:57:11.029]  It's up 5,690 percent.
[01:57:13.511 --> 01:57:16.073]  Number three, a wooden baseball bat.
[01:57:16.213 --> 01:57:19.416]  I agree the aluminum is better, not going to break, but you could put nails in the wooden one.
[01:57:20.216 --> 01:57:25.180]  Midwest American Ash wooden baseball bat, RRP.
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:31.244]  See, folks, you can have a hammer in your car, even in places like New York where victims are disarmed, or a baseball bat.
[01:57:31.905 --> 01:57:33.686]  It's, you know, you're playing baseball, you're driving nails.
[01:57:34.727 --> 01:57:37.529]  Bronx 32-inch wooden baseball bat, 3,734% up.
[01:57:42.477 --> 01:57:47.058]  And then next is a Raleigh folding work stand and a tent.
[01:57:47.839 --> 01:57:50.119]  But I tell you, Stewart, that is the answer.
[01:57:50.339 --> 01:57:58.762]  Can you imagine being the poor Brits and not being able to have a gun while the looters set fire to people's businesses and homes and women are jumping out of the tops of buildings?
[01:57:59.302 --> 01:58:03.983]  I mean, I'm sorry, setting fires to buildings is a terrorist action and those people need to be shot.
[01:58:05.044 --> 01:58:09.085]  I mean, isn't that legal and lawful if somebody's setting your house on fire that you shoot them?
[01:58:10.452 --> 01:58:10.952]  I think so.
[01:58:11.052 --> 01:58:13.933]  If it's a threat to life, absolutely.
[01:58:14.133 --> 01:58:16.714]  You can stop them from burning you to death.
[01:58:17.294 --> 01:58:17.694]  You bet.
[01:58:18.954 --> 01:58:25.316]  But I mean, look at these poor domesticated people in England at the mercy of scum.
[01:58:25.336 --> 01:58:28.757]  Well, that's the problem with relying on hand tools.
[01:58:28.797 --> 01:58:31.438]  You're relying on youth and strength, too.
[01:58:31.958 --> 01:58:35.379]  So if you're an old lady, how is she going to use a baseball bat against a young bug?
[01:58:35.399 --> 01:58:37.260]  It's going to be much more difficult.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:37.860]  She needs a gun.
[01:58:39.537 --> 01:58:41.578]  She does, and women need guns.
[01:58:43.178 --> 01:58:47.159]  Well, yeah, that's the whole point of firearms, is they take out the equation of physical strength.
[01:58:47.679 --> 01:58:51.980]  Otherwise, it's the guy that can hold the heaviest shield and the heaviest broadsword.
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:53.360]  That's who's gonna prevail.
[01:58:53.901 --> 01:58:57.401]  You know, youth and strength and skill, you know, will overcome age.
[01:58:58.102 --> 01:58:59.702]  So the old folks better get crafty.
[01:58:59.822 --> 01:59:04.563]  They better start thinking and planning and using force multipliers.
[01:59:04.603 --> 01:59:06.024]  Well, who do criminals target?
[01:59:06.044 --> 01:59:07.384]  They love to target the old.
[01:59:09.508 --> 01:59:10.048]  I don't think so.
[01:59:34.696 --> 01:59:35.116]  Gilded.
[01:59:35.917 --> 01:59:36.738]  Gilded, there you go.
[01:59:36.998 --> 01:59:40.381]  I hope they have mental guilt that they don't have, they have no confidence how to do that.
[01:59:40.501 --> 01:59:41.722]  Hopefully they'll rediscover.
[01:59:42.023 --> 01:59:45.005]  Well, no, no, it's confirmed, and the police don't like it, by the way.
[01:59:45.065 --> 01:59:54.033]  I was looking it up during the break, that the shop owners and communities are banding together with the baseball bats and things, and the police are telling them that's not good.
[01:59:54.354 --> 01:59:59.038]  They need to just let themselves be raped and killed in their houses and businesses burned down, Stewart.
[02:00:00.144 --> 02:00:01.305]  Yeah, England's where we're going.
[02:00:01.645 --> 02:00:14.392]  It's a hyper state with, uh, you got hyper criminals on one side, a hyper state on the other side, and in the middle are totally gilded, um, emaciated, you know, um, Eloi.
[02:00:14.672 --> 02:00:20.615]  It's like out of the movie, what was it called, The Time Machine, where they're just gonna sit around and let each other drown and let each other be eaten.
[02:00:20.815 --> 02:00:27.199]  By some strange twist of fate, we the Eloi had become the prey and the Morlocks the masters.
[02:00:28.524 --> 02:00:28.924]  Exactly.
[02:00:29.305 --> 02:00:30.165]  So that's what they want.
[02:00:30.245 --> 02:00:35.248]  And look, if people want security, they're going to turn to a hyper-state.
[02:00:35.508 --> 02:00:36.969]  They want you to turn to a hyper-state.
[02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:44.654]  They want you to think that your only way of being saved from living out a 28 Days Later or a Mega Man scenario is to have a police state.
[02:00:44.975 --> 02:00:48.537]  That's their solution to create the problem, as you've always said for many years.
[02:00:48.917 --> 02:00:51.860]  Tell you what, restate that for everybody.
[02:00:52.201 --> 02:00:58.668]  When we come back, then we'll let Stuart go, get into some more news, and then open the phones up to England, and then get to our next guest.
[02:01:01.488 --> 02:01:05.793]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:01:06.193 --> 02:01:12.060]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:14.362]  Number one, study the past.
[02:01:14.903 --> 02:01:16.665]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:01:17.305 --> 02:01:21.029]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:01:22.136 --> 02:01:24.397]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:01:25.218 --> 02:01:28.500]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:33.803]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:01:34.123 --> 02:01:37.565]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:01:38.125 --> 02:01:40.987]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:01:41.527 --> 02:01:45.110]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:01:46.010 --> 02:01:50.275]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:01:50.956 --> 02:01:55.062]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:01:55.562 --> 02:01:57.745]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:02:00.999 --> 02:02:04.643]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:02:04.663 --> 02:02:08.026]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:02:08.266 --> 02:02:13.050]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:02:13.070 --> 02:02:19.296]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:02:19.436 --> 02:02:21.699]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:02:22.199 --> 02:02:22.499]  Tim Geithner?
[02:02:22.519 --> 02:02:22.959]  Bernanke?
[02:02:23.019 --> 02:02:23.380]  They're arsonists!
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.140]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:26.501]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:02:41.127 --> 02:02:45.052]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[02:02:45.512 --> 02:02:48.075]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:02:48.396 --> 02:02:57.526]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:03:01.513 --> 02:03:05.134]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:03:05.474 --> 02:03:13.596]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:03:14.336 --> 02:03:18.377]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:03:18.957 --> 02:03:29.779]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:03:30.419 --> 02:03:39.429]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:03:39.929 --> 02:03:41.631]  Very easy to follow step by step.
[02:03:41.651 --> 02:03:44.694]  Learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:03:45.015 --> 02:03:47.417]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:59.873]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:04:00.495 --> 02:04:03.481]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:04:06.698 --> 02:04:16.001]  I've had Patrick Henningsen, who is a longtime reporter and documentary filmmaker, in fact he's reported for us from Copenhagen, Denmark, Climate Summit.
[02:04:16.601 --> 02:04:22.342]  He was there barricaded in the local pub and watched white people being drug out of cars, being beaten up.
[02:04:23.002 --> 02:04:25.363]  It's admitted that many of the riots were racial.
[02:04:25.763 --> 02:04:35.546]  There's also gangs of white kids with black kids running around in other smaller cities who are just looting, using it as an excuse for criminal action.
[02:04:36.977 --> 02:04:42.501]  But, you know, I've gotten some emails, I've seen some comments saying, Alex, this is political.
[02:04:42.901 --> 02:04:46.004]  Well, if this is political, this is not part of the political group I'm with.
[02:04:46.944 --> 02:04:49.026]  I'm sorry, burning down family homes.
[02:04:49.126 --> 02:04:55.610]  In fact, we were just showing a photo of that earlier, and images of women jumping out of their burning homes.
[02:04:56.991 --> 02:04:59.113]  Really, the rioters aren't going down.
[02:05:00.461 --> 02:05:01.101]  To Parliament.
[02:05:01.261 --> 02:05:03.082]  They're not going over to BBC.
[02:05:03.102 --> 02:05:06.064]  They're not going over to Sky Television.
[02:05:07.004 --> 02:05:08.625]  They're not going to MI6.
[02:05:08.825 --> 02:05:11.526]  Because the police would just shoot you there.
[02:05:12.346 --> 02:05:15.748]  No, they're burning down neighborhoods and little shops.
[02:05:16.848 --> 02:05:18.869]  And I guess that's political to some of you.
[02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.910]  And you know what?
[02:05:21.730 --> 02:05:28.259]  I guess at the end of the day that is what we're going to see in this country as the welfare checks don't buy the goods anymore.
[02:05:28.279 --> 02:05:29.340]  You're still going to get your welfare check.
[02:05:29.380 --> 02:05:30.802]  You're still going to get your food stamp card.
[02:05:31.243 --> 02:05:33.266]  It's just that the allotment isn't going to go up.
[02:05:33.326 --> 02:05:35.368]  The cola isn't going to go up.
[02:05:36.670 --> 02:05:38.971]  And I'm not saying you're Social Security's welfare, folks.
[02:05:38.991 --> 02:05:41.051]  The point is, it's an entitlement.
[02:05:41.351 --> 02:05:42.771]  It's something the government controls.
[02:05:43.392 --> 02:05:47.372]  And they're devaluing the dollar, as JP Morgan announced.
[02:05:47.933 --> 02:05:50.433]  Gold's going to go to $2,500 by the end of the year or higher.
[02:05:50.473 --> 02:05:52.454]  That's MSNBC, CBC.
[02:05:52.914 --> 02:05:57.895]  Because the dollar has been devalued.
[02:05:58.735 --> 02:06:02.058]  And other currencies are being devalued by the banking cartel.
[02:06:02.759 --> 02:06:08.764]  And so, was Reginald Denny having, you know, his face clubbed in with a brick because he was white?
[02:06:08.784 --> 02:06:09.645]  Was that political?
[02:06:09.985 --> 02:06:11.926]  Should I have, like, said, kill him!
[02:06:12.307 --> 02:06:13.007]  It's political!
[02:06:13.968 --> 02:06:20.874]  Mindlessly running around and burning things will empower the establishment to crack down and take everyone's rights.
[02:06:21.275 --> 02:06:23.997]  The British Ministry of Defence in 2007 said austerity
[02:06:27.205 --> 02:06:34.716]  Because of the banking crisis, this is before it happened, would cause unrest and that they would set up a police state in response.
[02:06:35.197 --> 02:06:36.659]  The Rand Corporation says it.
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:38.301]  And you've got so many
[02:06:39.449 --> 02:06:49.232]  Uninformed, mental midgets out there who are smart enough to know the government's lying to them, but not sophisticated enough to know that we're a restorationist.
[02:06:49.652 --> 02:07:02.897]  We want to restore law and order, a rule of law, a constitution, private property, sovereignty, and a compact of men and women together to defend individual rights, not the red terror model that is normally
[02:07:04.574 --> 02:07:09.243]  Comes right after a bunch of poor people running around burning things.
[02:07:10.535 --> 02:07:10.875]  Okay?
[02:07:11.675 --> 02:07:14.356]  This is what allows the system to collapse things.
[02:07:14.656 --> 02:07:15.857]  Stuart, you're a historian.
[02:07:16.537 --> 02:07:20.718]  You are a, you know, top of your class lawyer, what, Yale?
[02:07:20.738 --> 02:07:24.460]  You know, worked for Ron Paul, Army paratrooper.
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.881]  You've studied, you've won awards for your papers on history.
[02:07:28.301 --> 02:07:34.563]  I mean, I'm not a rocket science, but, I mean, isn't what I'm saying here just common sense history?
[02:07:36.129 --> 02:07:36.710]  Absolutely.
[02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:37.991]  It's the standard pattern.
[02:07:39.252 --> 02:07:42.315]  It's caused chaos and they capitalize on it.
[02:07:42.935 --> 02:07:46.218]  And this is what's been going on now in this country for decades.
[02:07:46.258 --> 02:07:48.080]  Well, you're not a good revolutionary patriot.
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:49.842]  You don't like burning down family dwellings.
[02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:58.022]  The problem is, like you said, you wind up with the French Revolution rather than the American Revolution.
[02:07:58.082 --> 02:08:03.624]  You wind up with the guillotine and destruction of everyone's rights, and then rule by bosses.
[02:08:04.104 --> 02:08:05.404]  And you wind up with animal farm.
[02:08:05.564 --> 02:08:08.125]  Some animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.
[02:08:08.843 --> 02:08:13.226]  But you're not restoring the republic, you're just tearing it down in a different way.
[02:08:13.266 --> 02:08:27.855]  And notice, we're being singled out by the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, White House, I'm on the White House enemies list, total MSNBC, CNN, Nightline demonization, 24-7, because we're the real Americans.
[02:08:27.935 --> 02:08:29.176]  We want real rule of law.
[02:08:29.196 --> 02:08:30.537]  We want the American system.
[02:08:30.777 --> 02:08:31.878]  We want due process.
[02:08:33.419 --> 02:08:40.844]  We've got the control left saying we're back because we don't want an American Arab Spring that Al Gore called for by the environmentalists burning things.
[02:08:40.864 --> 02:08:42.025]  He said that last week.
[02:08:42.045 --> 02:08:46.028]  I mean, he's calling for that here with his people because we're going to resist that.
[02:08:46.068 --> 02:08:56.675]  We're going to resist government tyranny, military tyranny, police tyranny, because we're for truth and justice, because we are with the founding fathers and follow their genius, their idea.
[02:08:56.775 --> 02:08:59.317]  We're the enemy because we are the hope.
[02:08:59.697 --> 02:09:00.898]  You, the listeners of this show,
[02:09:01.198 --> 02:09:02.098]  We've got history.
[02:09:02.158 --> 02:09:02.918]  We're informed.
[02:09:03.158 --> 02:09:04.999]  We called this coming decades before.
[02:09:05.459 --> 02:09:08.920]  And they know we've got the light of liberty in the gathering darkness.
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:10.640]  And they want to snuff that liberty.
[02:09:10.840 --> 02:09:15.961]  And it's up to you, the listeners, to spread this radio show and the videos and the information.
[02:09:15.981 --> 02:09:18.001]  Infowars.com are the four wins.
[02:09:18.281 --> 02:09:22.042]  Because we've got to stand up now at this critical juncture.
[02:09:22.622 --> 02:09:30.744]  Stuart, explain the historical juncture we're at and the difference between a gelded, disarmed public and an independent, strong yeoman population.
[02:09:32.159 --> 02:09:32.720]  Well just that.
[02:09:33.201 --> 02:09:48.003]  We're supposed to be sovereign citizens in a sovereign state to take personal responsibility for our safety as a militia, as a posse, as our own volunteer fire department, not turning it over to experts and not guilding ourselves.
[02:09:48.563 --> 02:09:52.225]  And the government is always offering you the free lunch.
[02:09:52.685 --> 02:09:54.466]  Just let us professionals handle it.
[02:09:54.526 --> 02:09:55.406]  You just go vote.
[02:09:55.706 --> 02:09:57.287]  But don't have a gun.
[02:09:57.687 --> 02:09:59.328]  Don't organize for your own defense.
[02:09:59.808 --> 02:10:03.590]  Don't take personal responsibility for security of your neighborhood and your community.
[02:10:03.730 --> 02:10:04.590]  Leave it to North Carolina.
[02:10:04.610 --> 02:10:05.331]  Leave it to FEMA.
[02:10:05.591 --> 02:10:06.451]  We'll take care of you.
[02:10:06.831 --> 02:10:07.592]  That's what they want.
[02:10:07.792 --> 02:10:12.654]  They want us to become just like all the other countries throughout history that have gone down the road of tyranny.
[02:10:13.074 --> 02:10:16.075]  And the way to counteract that is to do what they don't want.
[02:10:16.475 --> 02:10:17.496]  Form into posses.
[02:10:18.056 --> 02:10:33.753]  Start a militia in your county, take personal responsibility for your safety, learn how to shoot, go to an Appleseed program rifle class, which is free for $75 for the whole weekend, and learn how to shoot and take personal responsibility and take it back from the ground up.
[02:10:34.153 --> 02:10:34.954]  That's the solution.
[02:10:35.194 --> 02:10:37.056]  And I want to warn folks about militias.
[02:10:37.257 --> 02:10:39.939]  Real, and I want you to continue, real militias are great.
[02:10:40.771 --> 02:10:41.752]  They're constitutional.
[02:10:42.373 --> 02:10:54.047]  But if guys come to you and say, psst, be part of something secret, let's go surveil the police department, that group's being led by a Fed trying to set you up to create the illusion of dangerous secret groups.
[02:10:54.228 --> 02:10:57.451]  Real militias go to the city council and speak out.
[02:10:58.012 --> 02:11:00.193]  Real militias go help run soup kitchens.
[02:11:00.574 --> 02:11:07.738]  Real militias go and educate their police and invite them to be part of it, or go to the sheriff and offer to assist, or run for sheriff.
[02:11:08.078 --> 02:11:16.824]  Real militias are out in the open, or you can, with your cousin, your brother, and one neighbor, have a military history club that is completely secret.
[02:11:17.164 --> 02:11:21.507]  Either go completely secret, still be totally lawful, or be completely public.
[02:11:21.847 --> 02:11:24.509]  Now, I know you've studied special forces operations.
[02:11:24.989 --> 02:11:27.473]  You know, behind any lines in communist situations.
[02:11:27.753 --> 02:11:29.356]  But isn't that the way to go, Stewart?
[02:11:29.396 --> 02:11:30.618]  Don't go either way.
[02:11:30.738 --> 02:11:34.404]  Totally dark, totally secret, or totally political and public, Stewart.
[02:11:35.874 --> 02:11:48.025]  They had the Sons of Liberty, which was a secret organization, and they had their very public militias, because that's the way you get everybody in the community to get trained and united and take responsibility for themselves.
[02:11:48.065 --> 02:11:49.106]  That's what the founders intended.
[02:11:49.146 --> 02:11:51.648]  They did not want to see Kramer and hide.
[02:11:52.389 --> 02:11:56.032]  So yeah, do one or the other, but don't do the thing in the middle like you said.
[02:11:56.052 --> 02:11:56.953]  It's very, very wise.
[02:11:57.435 --> 02:12:07.920]  Well, the minute somebody comes to you and says, let's practice making pipe bombs, that is a fed trying to get you to be involved in criminal activity so other people get scared and don't join real militias.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:14.783]  All it is is a civil defense local posse for the imploding society, and people are ready for this.
[02:12:14.843 --> 02:12:15.463]  They're ready.
[02:12:15.804 --> 02:12:16.364]  They're ready.
[02:12:16.664 --> 02:12:24.388]  We've got to organize now with our neighbors, so if there's a total collapse and a marauding crew of scum comes down the road, we're ready.
[02:12:24.728 --> 02:12:27.089]  When you're out of town working, your neighbor's watching your wife.
[02:12:27.469 --> 02:12:29.170]  When he's out of town, you're watching them.
[02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:31.812]  We've got to get back to being real people.
[02:12:32.032 --> 02:12:34.514]  This is what all our ancestors did in every culture.
[02:12:34.814 --> 02:12:37.115]  You either do this, or you're overrun slaves.
[02:12:38.256 --> 02:12:38.796]  That's correct.
[02:12:38.976 --> 02:12:42.298]  You need community, and I think the first thing you should do is a neighborhood watch.
[02:12:42.959 --> 02:12:45.500]  That will take care of a lot of things all at one time.
[02:12:46.841 --> 02:12:52.365]  And that means a local neighborhood watch, not one run by the feds, where you're watching for people with Ron Paul stickers.
[02:12:54.051 --> 02:13:00.037]  It means, like you just said a minute ago, neighbors looking out for each other, and that can turn into an ad hoc militia when necessary.
[02:13:00.377 --> 02:13:06.483]  And then while you're doing that, you also work to establish a formal official county militia or town militia.
[02:13:06.864 --> 02:13:07.404]  You do both.
[02:13:07.885 --> 02:13:08.946]  But you gotta get going.
[02:13:08.966 --> 02:13:16.573]  That's why I encourage folks to go to OperationSleepingGiant.com, our new initiative to wake up veterans and focus on preparedness.
[02:13:17.853 --> 02:13:20.575]  All right, in closing, as I'm ranting here, these are incredible times.
[02:13:20.975 --> 02:13:28.659]  Everything that's happening, Stuart, is proving that your analysis, mine, Ron Paul's, is 100% dead on because we're following history.
[02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:30.520]  We know the globalist roadmap.
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:31.581]  We know what's coming next.
[02:13:31.981 --> 02:13:34.543]  Are you... Because five years ago, I never got chills.
[02:13:34.683 --> 02:13:38.185]  Are you... When I say chills, I mean hair on the back of my neck.
[02:13:38.685 --> 02:13:43.748]  My spidey sense has been off the chart the last six months, and it's getting more and more intense.
[02:13:43.788 --> 02:13:45.269]  Can you feel what's coming?
[02:13:46.405 --> 02:13:46.825]  Absolutely.
[02:13:46.926 --> 02:13:54.932]  I mean, I'm reading the book When Money Dies right now about the Weimar hyperinflation, and it gets eerie and chilling to see the parallels.
[02:13:55.573 --> 02:13:58.035]  We're doing precisely the same thing that they did.
[02:13:58.495 --> 02:13:59.516]  And look where they wound up.
[02:13:59.576 --> 02:14:01.297]  They wound up with a hyper-dictatorship.
[02:14:01.918 --> 02:14:13.747]  And so if we're going to avoid that, we need to step off the treadmill of the matrix and get back to being what the founders intended, which is sovereign people in sovereign communities.
[02:14:13.868 --> 02:14:14.328]  We have to.
[02:14:15.489 --> 02:14:16.429]  Well, that's it, Stewart.
[02:14:16.589 --> 02:14:27.112]  The system consciously, decades ago, but the real markers 12 years ago, made the decision to hyperinflate, destroy us, and set up the police state as the answer.
[02:14:27.132 --> 02:14:27.772]  They've already got it.
[02:14:28.132 --> 02:14:33.313]  Threat fusion centers, clergy response teams, Emergency Centers Act, all lined up.
[02:14:33.874 --> 02:14:35.694]  They are intending to go forward with this.
[02:14:35.754 --> 02:14:39.475]  That's what's so incredible about the magnitude of what we face.
[02:14:39.495 --> 02:14:42.656]  But the good news is, centralized systems don't work very well.
[02:14:43.616 --> 02:14:48.480]  And we, the patriots, had decades-long jump on them because we saw what they were doing.
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:51.022]  We got laughed at a long time ago, Stuart, but not now.
[02:14:52.383 --> 02:14:53.704]  Well, we're still weak, though.
[02:14:53.724 --> 02:14:59.928]  The problem is a centralized system can kill a lot of people before it finally collapses, and that's the danger.
[02:14:59.948 --> 02:15:08.855]  So what we have to do is make sure that we're as strong as possible in our local communities so that we are not desperate and hungry and starving, and they have less of a justification.
[02:15:08.875 --> 02:15:12.558]  Then you get more of the military and police who will say no and side with us.
[02:15:14.366 --> 02:15:19.414]  Well, you know we're being listened to at military bases all over the world right now, so the military is starting to wake up.
[02:15:21.212 --> 02:15:22.013]  Absolutely.
[02:15:22.073 --> 02:15:34.802]  I get messages all the time from active duty soldiers letting us know that, hey, they're not going to join our organization because they don't want to be purged out of their unit, but they want to let us know that they and at least half the guys in their unit agree completely.
[02:15:35.382 --> 02:15:38.945]  And so they are waking up, but they're still susceptible to human nature.
[02:15:39.325 --> 02:15:46.550]  Like in Katrina, if they believe it's a real emergency, they're more likely to go along with unconstitutional behavior, unconstitutional orders.
[02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:47.551]  And so that's why
[02:15:48.051 --> 02:15:48.932]  Absolutely.
[02:15:49.293 --> 02:15:50.494]  Stewart, great job.
[02:15:50.554 --> 02:15:51.114]  Great job.
[02:15:51.134 --> 02:15:51.795]  We'll be right back.

[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:52.381]  Attention gardeners!
[02:17:52.441 --> 02:17:54.803]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:17:55.043 --> 02:17:59.367]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:17:59.567 --> 02:18:07.454]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:18:07.754 --> 02:18:10.596]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:18:10.876 --> 02:18:18.420]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:24.104]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:18:24.324 --> 02:18:29.887]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:18:30.167 --> 02:18:33.409]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:18:33.709 --> 02:18:37.071]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:18:37.291 --> 02:18:42.334]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:18:42.374 --> 02:18:45.236]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:18:45.256 --> 02:18:45.456]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:18:50.979 --> 02:18:54.581]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[02:18:54.821 --> 02:18:55.522]  Then stop!
[02:18:56.002 --> 02:18:59.044]  Stop buying metal lids and get Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:18:59.444 --> 02:19:06.569]  Made of USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, Tattler Canning Lids let you safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[02:19:06.949 --> 02:19:10.592]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways that contain BPA.
[02:19:10.932 --> 02:19:19.137]  But Tattler canning lids are indefinitely reusable and guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning and contain no BPA.
[02:19:19.417 --> 02:19:29.444]  Tattler lids are dishwasher safe, perfect for standard pressure or water bath canning, eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion, fit standard mason jars, and are proudly made in the USA.
[02:19:29.904 --> 02:19:31.205]  Place orders by phone at 877-747-2793.

[02:19:32.645 --> 02:19:33.986]  Or go to reusablecanninglids.com.
[02:19:34.026 --> 02:19:35.147]  That's reusablecanninglids.com.
[02:19:35.167 --> 02:19:36.467]  Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[02:19:36.507 --> 02:19:37.928]  The original since 1976.
[02:19:55.749 --> 02:20:05.815]  You heard earlier Patrick Henningsen, a reporter from England who was in South London in Brixton and witnessed racial attacks.
[02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:20.193]  If you have been in England and witnessed exactly what type of looting and attacks are going on and arson, and you can get on the line and call us, I would love to hear from you.
[02:20:20.373 --> 02:20:26.695]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[02:20:26.715 --> 02:20:29.756]  1-800-259-9231, and we will get you up and on the air.
[02:20:30.036 --> 02:20:35.818]  I know most people can't call in a toll-free number from England, but if you can call Skype or your country access code, we'd love to hear from you.
[02:20:35.838 --> 02:20:35.878]  800-259-9231.
[02:20:39.759 --> 02:20:44.003]  Mark Moreno of Climate Depot is going to be joining us.
[02:20:44.243 --> 02:20:50.608]  Reporters reported that at the Aspen Institute event last week, Al Gore was screaming, cussing, blowing up.
[02:20:51.408 --> 02:20:52.810]  Mark Moreno first reported that.
[02:20:52.850 --> 02:21:00.335]  I saw it in a bunch of mainstream newspapers, including The Hill today, the big paper on Capitol Hill, that indeed he did do that.
[02:21:01.817 --> 02:21:06.861]  And he basically consented that their entire global warming takeover scam is in deep trouble.
[02:21:07.694 --> 02:21:14.199]  This is the same guy that told us NAFTA and GATT would double our industrial jobs in a decade, when it actually took more than half of those jobs.
[02:21:14.679 --> 02:21:16.541]  This is a good deal, Larry.
[02:21:16.901 --> 02:21:18.502]  I got a good old boy accent.
[02:21:18.983 --> 02:21:19.803]  You can trust me.
[02:21:19.823 --> 02:21:20.964]  Look at that guy's eyes.
[02:21:21.024 --> 02:21:24.907]  I mean, he is just... Would you buy a car or an air conditioner from that guy?
[02:21:25.467 --> 02:21:28.350]  If he knocked on your door trying to sell you encyclopedias, what would you do?
[02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:29.731]  I mean, man-bear-pig.
[02:21:31.109 --> 02:21:33.851]  So it's a real pleasure to watch him crash and burn.
[02:21:34.132 --> 02:21:35.473]  Now Soros is doing a little better.
[02:21:35.533 --> 02:21:46.622]  It's reported that he's probably the guy that bet 800 and something mil, and it was 87 mil, and made 10 billion off of the dollar devaluation.
[02:21:47.043 --> 02:21:57.712]  And if that's true, that he got inside knowledge on S&P, and that he's the one that made that money, as the Daily Mail and others are pointing to, then another reason Soros
[02:21:58.312 --> 02:22:02.375]  He needs to get his bacon in the political fire.
[02:22:02.415 --> 02:22:04.897]  You know, he's the guy that, quote, broke the Bank of England.
[02:22:06.098 --> 02:22:08.399]  Here is some of the other news.
[02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:13.443]  The rioting underclass product of a diseased culture.
[02:22:15.157 --> 02:22:22.325]  BlackBerry website hacked as company pledges to help cops find Brit rioters.
[02:22:22.926 --> 02:22:27.250]  Police to use plastic bullets on rampaging youth in Britain.
[02:22:27.951 --> 02:22:32.917]  Sony UK warehouse set ablaze as violence from London riots escalates.
[02:22:36.255 --> 02:22:42.938]  A 634 point stock market crash and eight more reasons why you should be deeply concerned that the U.S.
[02:22:43.618 --> 02:22:46.139]  government has lost its AAA credit rating.
[02:22:46.159 --> 02:22:50.381]  And then we have this satire article by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:22:51.262 --> 02:22:55.083]  Cameron to step down, recognize rioters as legitimate government.
[02:22:56.504 --> 02:23:00.445]  Because the exact type of activity, Al Qaeda run and funded by the U.S.
[02:23:00.485 --> 02:23:03.647]  and British governments, was launched four months ago in Libya.
[02:23:04.571 --> 02:23:13.510]  And they've been torching, killing, looting, uh, racially, because it's, it's, it's, uh, Qaddafi's teamed up with African, black African Libyans.
[02:23:15.202 --> 02:23:19.426]  And so, there's been a bunch of racial attacks on blacks.
[02:23:19.926 --> 02:23:21.147]  You notice I was against that.
[02:23:21.628 --> 02:23:26.732]  I'm outraged by people racially pulling over black people and shooting them and killing them because they're black.
[02:23:27.353 --> 02:23:29.014]  At a fundamental level, it makes me sick.
[02:23:29.555 --> 02:23:31.937]  Just like it makes me sick that whites are being racially attacked.
[02:23:31.997 --> 02:23:36.081]  It's disgusting behavior to pull over some completely innocent person and do that.
[02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:36.981]  But hey!
[02:23:37.922 --> 02:23:50.970]  Why not have NATO announce a no-fly zone, and have NATO start bombing all of England, blowing up their TV stations, and bombing their electrical power grid, as they're doing in Libya, because a group is rebelling!
[02:23:51.711 --> 02:24:01.116]  And so you need to make them the official diplomatic group, and give them the government, and put crowns on their heads, and move them into Windsor Palace.
[02:24:02.297 --> 02:24:06.360]  So, Cameron to step down, recognize rioters as legitimate government,
[02:24:07.282 --> 02:24:07.542]  U.K.
[02:24:07.602 --> 02:24:11.565]  rebels to be given own embassy as humanitarian intervention looms.
[02:24:12.425 --> 02:24:22.652]  Given the fine example set in Libya, it follows that the rebels who expressed their grievances against the establishment last night by burning and looting half of London and other cities around the U.K.
[02:24:23.072 --> 02:24:28.496]  should swiftly be given their own embassy and declare the legitimate government of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
[02:24:28.516 --> 02:24:29.557]  Yes, that would be very nice.
[02:24:30.666 --> 02:24:39.573]  David Cameron and the Queen need to relinquish power immediately now that their authority to rule has been so clearly and justifiably undermined.
[02:24:40.073 --> 02:24:50.902]  The actions of the police to disperse these rebels also amounts to an international war crime and mandates an immediate humanitarian intervention from NATO powers.
[02:24:51.582 --> 02:24:58.449]  If Cameron and the Queen fail to step down and recognize the Webels as the legitimate government, U.S.
[02:24:58.629 --> 02:25:02.153]  warplanes are on standby to enforce a no-fly zone over Great Britain.
[02:25:02.614 --> 02:25:10.402]  Reports are also circulating that NATO will target the Prime Minister and his entire family for assassination if he refuses to vacate London.
[02:25:11.340 --> 02:25:12.561]  This is what was done with Gaddafi.
[02:25:13.121 --> 02:25:24.928]  The rebels who are attempting to liberate themselves from the corrupt regime by ransacking JD sports clothing outlets should be embraced, commended, and supported by the international community.
[02:25:25.348 --> 02:25:30.612]  Also, they should be praised for burning down family homes and almost killing people saved by fire departments.
[02:25:31.552 --> 02:25:36.137]  The bank accounts of the British government should be seized and handed over to the rebels immediately.
[02:25:36.598 --> 02:25:40.082]  Of course, that was satire, but we're illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[02:25:40.282 --> 02:25:41.043]  We'll be right back.
[02:25:41.063 --> 02:25:41.463]  Stay with us.
[02:25:42.625 --> 02:25:43.546]  We're on the march.
[02:25:44.026 --> 02:25:45.628]  The empire's on the run.
[02:25:46.549 --> 02:25:49.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:25:52.353 --> 02:26:00.199]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:26:00.479 --> 02:26:02.761]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:26:03.021 --> 02:26:08.225]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:26:08.405 --> 02:26:11.187]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:26:11.447 --> 02:26:12.448]  The crazy part is...
[02:26:12.648 --> 02:26:13.548]  He's usually right.
[02:26:13.749 --> 02:26:19.691]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:26:19.991 --> 02:26:23.213]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:26:23.393 --> 02:26:28.915]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:26:29.155 --> 02:26:30.476]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:26:30.796 --> 02:26:31.997]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:26:32.097 --> 02:26:34.658]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:26:34.778 --> 02:26:38.820]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.721]  You can find the video at www.
[02:26:41.781 --> 02:26:43.483]  End of America three dot com.
[02:26:43.603 --> 02:26:44.605]  That's end of America.
[02:26:44.745 --> 02:26:46.066]  The number three dot com.
[02:26:46.207 --> 02:26:49.931]  Watch the free video at www dot end of America three dot com.
[02:26:50.071 --> 02:26:51.814]  That's end of America three dot com.
[02:26:52.414 --> 02:26:55.478]  Congratulations to our friends at e foods direct dot com.
[02:26:55.759 --> 02:26:56.900]  In August, they celebrate
[02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:57.521]  We're good to go.
[02:27:12.017 --> 02:27:12.337]  We're good.
[02:27:29.104 --> 02:27:32.766]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex and get 30% off a one year food supply.
[02:27:32.786 --> 02:27:35.128]  If you have ever considered getting a supply, now is the time.
[02:27:35.148 --> 02:27:35.408]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:27:35.428 --> 02:27:37.469]  That's 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:27:51.798 --> 02:27:56.019]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:27:56.339 --> 02:27:56.619]  Number 1.
[02:27:57.259 --> 02:28:00.400]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:01.240]  Number 2.
[02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:06.082]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:28:06.422 --> 02:28:06.882]  It's true.
[02:28:07.162 --> 02:28:11.723]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:28:12.043 --> 02:28:12.583]  Number 3.
[02:28:12.863 --> 02:28:16.144]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:28:16.444 --> 02:28:20.145]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:28:20.365 --> 02:28:20.905]  Number 4.
[02:28:21.166 --> 02:28:23.527]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:28:23.908 --> 02:28:27.310]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:28.130]  Number 5.
[02:28:28.391 --> 02:28:32.313]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:28:32.534 --> 02:28:37.297]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:28:37.597 --> 02:28:41.598]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:28:41.758 --> 02:28:43.299]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:28:43.539 --> 02:28:45.619]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:28:45.779 --> 02:28:48.140]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:29:19.771 --> 02:29:26.636]  Well, Mark Moreno was the senior advisor to the big committee researching whether climate change was man-made or not.
[02:29:27.156 --> 02:29:35.822]  He runs the preeminent site researching the global crime bosses that want to be able to sabotage a toilet you have, light bulb, federal home inspections.
[02:29:36.763 --> 02:29:47.430]  Obama has announced, outside of law, as our supreme ruler, just like with the carbon taxes and regulations on power plants that aren't part of General Electric's insider operation,
[02:29:48.290 --> 02:29:56.837]  That fire trucks, concrete mixers, semis, heavy-duty pickups, and all trucks in between will for the first time have to trim fuel consumption.
[02:29:57.418 --> 02:30:00.040]  They already do that with all the catalytic converters.
[02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:01.101]  And emissions.
[02:30:01.381 --> 02:30:03.683]  They've always been cutting emissions for two decades.
[02:30:04.243 --> 02:30:05.624]  Of heat-trapping gases.
[02:30:06.585 --> 02:30:07.906]  So that evil carbon dioxide.
[02:30:08.327 --> 02:30:12.070]  Under new efficiency standards announced Tuesday by President Obama.
[02:30:12.670 --> 02:30:16.673]  The White House said the standards will save businesses billions of dollars in fuel costs.
[02:30:16.773 --> 02:30:17.074]  Oh yeah.
[02:30:17.867 --> 02:30:18.448]  Yeah, right.
[02:30:18.788 --> 02:30:21.271]  Help reduce oil consumption and cut air pollution.
[02:30:21.692 --> 02:30:25.576]  Standards also apply to vehicle models after 2014 or three years away.
[02:30:28.587 --> 02:30:29.828]  This is just devastating.
[02:30:30.268 --> 02:30:32.108]  And it's carbon rules.
[02:30:33.969 --> 02:30:46.373]  But the good news is, despite all their fear-mongering and Obama saying, or his mouthpiece Al Gore saying, polar bears can't swim, we've had some huge victories.
[02:30:46.873 --> 02:30:50.015]  We have Mark Moreno here to break that down for us.
[02:30:50.395 --> 02:30:54.756]  Some big, big, big victories have taken place in the last two weeks.
[02:30:55.196 --> 02:30:56.117]  The Hadron Collider,
[02:30:57.097 --> 02:31:04.347]  Found and backed previous science that it's space ions that are forming most of the heat-trapping clouds.
[02:31:05.448 --> 02:31:09.273]  NASA's had to admit that more heat goes out of the atmosphere than they thought.
[02:31:10.876 --> 02:31:17.418]  Others like NASA have had to admit that carbon dioxide follows heat increases, not the other way around.
[02:31:18.758 --> 02:31:26.520]  Three years ago it was found in UK courts that Al Gore had flipped the graph and had carbon dioxide before the heat increases.
[02:31:27.761 --> 02:31:39.784]  So a lot of things are coming out right now, but the best news that Mark Moreno covered at ClimateDepot.com, and today I noticed it's in the Hill newspaper and other mainline publications confirming it,
[02:31:40.484 --> 02:31:48.073]  Was that he began a expletive-laced tirade that we cannot repeat here and all but admitted
[02:31:49.264 --> 02:31:57.706]  That their system is falling apart and that they are not going to be able to get their overt carbon taxes on people.
[02:31:57.786 --> 02:32:10.589]  So they've invested billions in getting the public to have to pay them an indulgence for the sin of breathing, because we put off carbon dioxide just like cars do, that plants then respirate from and live from.
[02:32:11.469 --> 02:32:14.230]  And so their system is being routed
[02:32:14.970 --> 02:32:18.372]  According to the view and research of Mark Moreno and others.
[02:32:19.032 --> 02:32:26.556]  So, Mark, please give us a breakdown of the devastating victories against the carbon mafia that the globe is having.
[02:32:27.276 --> 02:32:29.177]  Well, the first... Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[02:32:29.657 --> 02:32:32.639]  The first victory is science and data.
[02:32:33.319 --> 02:32:34.820]  And this is so compelling.
[02:32:34.860 --> 02:32:39.302]  From A to Z, the entire case for man-made global warming is collapsing.
[02:32:39.382 --> 02:32:41.123]  You can start with Antarctica, the Arctic.
[02:32:41.683 --> 02:32:43.864]  Antarctica is at an air-record sea-ice extent.
[02:32:44.364 --> 02:32:45.044]  The Arctic.
[02:32:45.525 --> 02:32:47.826]  So many new studies have come out on the Arctic.
[02:32:47.906 --> 02:32:48.626]  Are you ready for this?
[02:32:48.706 --> 02:32:49.687]  Drumroll, please.
[02:32:50.227 --> 02:33:00.693]  Andrew Revkin, the mainstream, lefty, environmental reporter for the New York Times, announced yesterday that he no longer believes the Arctic will face a death spiral.
[02:33:01.033 --> 02:33:06.256]  And he actually says, quote, I'm not worried about the resilience of the Arctic and not worried about a tipping point.
[02:33:06.696 --> 02:33:08.437]  And he rejects the idea of a death spiral.
[02:33:08.697 --> 02:33:17.826]  This is a mainstream reporter bailing out on probably the single greatest talking point that the global warmers have had, the frightening and scary loss of the Arctic.
[02:33:17.906 --> 02:33:26.554]  Never mind that the low point of Arctic ice, 2007, was due to high pressure days, unusual winds, ocean currents, and not man-made CO2.
[02:33:26.714 --> 02:33:30.157]  Never mind that we started monitoring the ice in 1979 at the end.
[02:33:31.238 --> 02:33:31.659]  I think so.
[02:33:49.867 --> 02:33:57.137]  Even the polar bear that killed this kid recently was actually, they were talking about how much ice there was in the area.
[02:33:57.618 --> 02:33:59.060]  So, you look at sea level.
[02:33:59.340 --> 02:34:01.863]  Al Gore showed you maps of Florida half underwater.
[02:34:02.304 --> 02:34:06.910]  Sea level now, not only is it not accelerating, what some monitors are showing, sea level decelerating.
[02:34:08.382 --> 02:34:10.485]  It's actually dropping since 2004.
[02:34:10.805 --> 02:34:18.334]  Mount Kilimanjaro gourmeted a huge feature in its film, now gaining ice and snow on every single issue that they have promoted.
[02:34:18.354 --> 02:34:24.542]  They have not only egg on their face, but they are being, it is revealing the utter collapse for their case.
[02:34:24.682 --> 02:34:27.346]  And before you continue, let me just back up what you're saying.
[02:34:27.706 --> 02:34:28.787]  This is four days ago.
[02:34:29.008 --> 02:34:30.850]  Arctic tipping point may not be reached.
[02:34:31.251 --> 02:34:38.680]  BBC, who carry the holy grail of brainwashing and guilting and propaganda,
[02:34:40.302 --> 02:34:49.791]  They say right here, writing in the Journal of Science, the team found evidence that ice levels were 50% lower in the Arctic 5,000 years ago.
[02:34:49.851 --> 02:34:51.733]  We've known that for decades from the ice core.
[02:34:52.193 --> 02:35:05.045]  But they do this scam every year where they show school kids and the general public on the news a satellite shot from the North Pole from space in the summer time-lapse showing upwards of a half of the Arctic disappearing.
[02:35:05.425 --> 02:35:06.906]  It always does that in the summer.
[02:35:07.246 --> 02:35:11.187]  And then Al Gore says there'll be no ice in one year, and he says it every year.
[02:35:11.507 --> 02:35:15.149]  And so again, the route is completely... They knew this decades ago.
[02:35:15.409 --> 02:35:24.872]  Why is the BBC and New York Times now admitting that polar bears can swim, their numbers are up five-fold in 50 years, that the Arctic used to be smaller?
[02:35:25.172 --> 02:35:27.473]  Why is there a complete route happening?
[02:35:28.370 --> 02:35:28.911]  I'm reading.
[02:35:29.432 --> 02:35:30.934]  And I studied this issue in the 90s.
[02:35:30.994 --> 02:35:32.297]  Remember the old deforestation?
[02:35:32.337 --> 02:35:33.418]  The Amazon rainforest?
[02:35:33.458 --> 02:35:34.821]  The Amazon's about to disappear.
[02:35:34.901 --> 02:35:36.423]  It'll be gone by the year 2000.
[02:35:36.684 --> 02:35:39.388]  This was in Disney films and National Geographic and kids shows.
[02:35:39.549 --> 02:35:41.993]  They had children terrified the last tree was going to be cut.
[02:35:43.097 --> 02:35:50.463]  It turns out, in 2009, the New York Times belatedly admitted that for every acre of rainforest cut, 50 may be regenerating.
[02:35:50.643 --> 02:35:54.046]  It was not such an urgent cause.
[02:35:54.186 --> 02:35:57.969]  After all, they quoted a scientist saying, they're calling it the galloping jungle.
[02:35:58.389 --> 02:36:02.933]  Old eco-scares don't just collapse overnight, they have to die a slow death.
[02:36:02.993 --> 02:36:06.896]  And what we're seeing, when you quote it from the BBC, or we're hearing from Andrew Rebkin in the New York Times,
[02:36:07.833 --> 02:36:11.076]  This is actually an accelerated death, but it doesn't collapse overnight.
[02:36:11.096 --> 02:36:19.483]  There's way too much money for man-made global warming to collapse, because the tens of billions of dollars just being poured into this climate con aren't going to go away.
[02:36:19.923 --> 02:36:26.728]  Scientists have made careers out of it, foundations, universities, United Nations, the media has invested, our government's invested in it.
[02:36:27.069 --> 02:36:33.574]  You have, I will say this delicately, people like John Holdren who need remedial science education.
[02:36:33.834 --> 02:36:34.655]  He actually predicted
[02:36:35.115 --> 02:36:37.537]  Pachari said there'd be no ice in the Himalayas with no
[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:55.861]  Let's talk about John Holdren.
[02:36:56.441 --> 02:37:02.406]  John Lennon, the ex-Beatle, made a scientific jump out of people like Paul Ehrlich and John Holdren.
[02:37:02.666 --> 02:37:07.950]  In 1979, he debated Dick Cavett on TV and mocked and ridiculed the overpopulation scare.
[02:37:08.250 --> 02:37:12.213]  And now we know the new population scare is underpopulation.
[02:37:12.413 --> 02:37:18.697]  And even some of the same people who warned of overpopulation are retracting themselves as global population is stabilizing.
[02:37:19.157 --> 02:37:21.719]  So it's just every scare they come up with fades.
[02:37:21.879 --> 02:37:23.841]  What's most shocking now about global warming, Alex?
[02:37:24.281 --> 02:37:28.424]  We have two recent scientists in Australia have now openly dissented.
[02:37:28.844 --> 02:37:34.627]  One of them, Professor Salby, is going to have a peer-reviewed study showing that CO2 follows the temperature rise.
[02:37:34.827 --> 02:37:36.669]  It's actually going to make it in the peer-reviewed journal.
[02:37:36.709 --> 02:37:40.151]  Skeptical scientists have been saying this for years.
[02:37:40.611 --> 02:37:41.812]  And Salby goes further.
[02:37:41.832 --> 02:37:45.514]  He's actually claiming that the recent rise in CO2 isn't even human-caused.
[02:37:45.594 --> 02:37:50.177]  It's all natural that humans don't even have that power to rise CO2 from our human activity.
[02:37:50.757 --> 02:37:53.879]  In one scientist, another one, Judith Curry, who used to be a warmist,
[02:37:53.899 --> 02:37:54.399]  I think.
[02:38:17.606 --> 02:38:29.569]  And there's always going to be extreme weather, and every time there is, he says, pay me money, and I'll fix everything.
[02:38:29.629 --> 02:38:44.153]  Now the problem is, and I want you to get into his tirade at the Aspen Institute, that you first broke from your sources, now confirmed, just blubbering anger by the collectivists that want to be able to run our lives.
[02:38:44.793 --> 02:38:47.634]  Talk about that, but then the problem is, they don't care.
[02:38:48.015 --> 02:38:54.037]  They're going ahead, outside of congressional law, and implementing all this garbage California is.
[02:38:54.678 --> 02:38:56.839]  Let me start with, yes, with your second point.
[02:38:57.899 --> 02:39:04.922]  Our washing machines have been decimated by Energy Star EPA regulations based in climate fares.
[02:39:05.342 --> 02:39:05.963]  And here's what I mean.
[02:39:06.023 --> 02:39:08.844]  No, I bought new ones a few years ago, they broke and wouldn't work.
[02:39:09.144 --> 02:39:10.885]  Bought more new ones, they broke and didn't work.
[02:39:11.145 --> 02:39:12.926]  And now I'm trying to find an old junky one.
[02:39:15.274 --> 02:39:15.875]  We're good to go.
[02:39:33.111 --> 02:39:33.772]  We're good to go.
[02:39:55.092 --> 02:39:58.275]  What, they've only sold like a thousand volts or something?
[02:39:58.375 --> 02:39:59.936]  No one wants their crud.
[02:40:13.587 --> 02:40:22.692]  People will be dying in Minnesota and other places in the winter when their cars run out of juice and they can't refuel them when they're stuck on the side of the road under, you know, 10-foot snow drift.
[02:40:23.232 --> 02:40:24.372]  It's a life-and-death issue.
[02:40:24.392 --> 02:40:30.355]  You have to have a GM calling for a gas tax increase so they can sell their cars that no one wants to buy.
[02:40:30.876 --> 02:40:33.817]  So they've already succeeded in many ways.
[02:40:33.837 --> 02:40:39.240]  And then, of course, we have the EPA regulations lying in wait that's going to regulate what we exhale from our mouth.
[02:40:39.760 --> 02:40:42.503]  We inhale CO2, we inhale oxygen, exhale CO2.
[02:40:42.543 --> 02:40:43.944]  We have those lying in wait.
[02:40:44.024 --> 02:40:53.992]  Obama has wisely decided to wait until after the next presidential election, but we are facing very serious threats, and that is going to be the regulatory nightmare of the world.
[02:40:54.012 --> 02:40:55.894]  We're already talking governments around the world.
[02:40:55.934 --> 02:41:01.038]  The Japanese government is telling their people they have to go to bed an hour early to fight global warming.
[02:41:01.278 --> 02:41:06.723]  The head of the UN climate panel, Rajendra Pachauri, has said that Americans can no longer have ice water in restaurants.
[02:41:07.664 --> 02:41:10.869]  But meanwhile all these guys live in incredible palaces.
[02:41:11.289 --> 02:41:21.444]  Nat Rothschild, you know, over there running the climate exchange has giant yachts, jets, private islands, lavish parties, Prince Charles calling to cut everybody's...
[02:41:22.565 --> 02:41:25.027]  You know, telling old ladies not to take hot baths.
[02:41:25.368 --> 02:41:28.530]  I mean, these people are so incredibly disgusting.
[02:41:28.550 --> 02:41:39.339]  But speaking of that, speaking of John Lennon on national TV talking about overpopulation being a fraud, here is that clip from the TV show you mentioned, Mark Moreno.
[02:41:39.379 --> 02:41:39.899]  Here it is.
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:42.881]  How does Yorker feel about overpopulation?
[02:41:43.182 --> 02:41:44.042]  As a woman, I believe.
[02:41:44.963 --> 02:41:51.068]  Well, I think the problem is not overpopulation as people believe to be, but it's more of
[02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:52.751]  The balance of things.
[02:41:53.291 --> 02:41:55.132]  What, you know, like food.
[02:41:55.612 --> 02:42:00.655]  Some part of the world is wasted of food and some parts, you know, nobody has food.
[02:42:01.275 --> 02:42:06.498]  That kind of balance, if that is solved, I don't think we would be worried so much about overpopulation.
[02:42:07.341 --> 02:42:12.343]  I think it's a bit of a joke the way people have made this overpopulation thing into a kind of myth.
[02:42:12.423 --> 02:42:13.743]  I don't really believe it, you know.
[02:42:14.003 --> 02:42:17.684]  I think whatever happens will balance itself out and work itself out.
[02:42:17.724 --> 02:42:22.646]  It's alright for us all living saying, oh well there's enough of us so we won't have any more, don't let anybody else live.
[02:42:23.186 --> 02:42:23.886]  I don't believe in that.
[02:42:23.926 --> 02:42:33.529]  I think we've got enough food and money to feed everybody and I think the natural balance, even though old people will last longer, I'm sure there's enough room for us and some of them can go to the moon anyway.
[02:42:34.318 --> 02:42:38.242]  You mean you think there's enough... Yeah, I don't believe all the population, you know?
[02:42:38.562 --> 02:42:44.868]  I think that's just a kind of myth that the government have thrown out to keep your mind off Vietnam and Ireland and all the important subjects.
[02:42:45.129 --> 02:42:46.270]  Oh, I think you're wrong about that.
[02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:47.331]  Oh, I don't care.
[02:42:50.580 --> 02:42:51.401]  And there you have it.
[02:42:51.861 --> 02:42:58.565]  John Lennon from the grave making a scientific jump out of Obama's science advisor John Holdren and Paul Ehrlich.
[02:42:58.585 --> 02:43:03.168]  By the way, Paul Ehrlich called for forced sterilization agents in our water to reduce population.
[02:43:03.328 --> 02:43:07.631]  He was called worse than Hitler by his contemporaries in the 1960s and 1970s.
[02:43:08.051 --> 02:43:16.837]  John Holdren opposed the agricultural revolution of Norman Borlaug who won a Nobel Prize by bringing golden rice to Asia and feeding
[02:43:17.237 --> 02:43:20.420]  Billions of people and creating, you know, a better life for people.
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:21.981]  You know why John Holdren opposed it?
[02:43:22.001 --> 02:43:25.104]  Because he didn't want our Earth to support more people.
[02:43:25.384 --> 02:43:33.551]  It is as Patrick Moore, the former founder of Greenpeace said, environmentalism today is the most anti-human agenda and that's what we're fighting in Africa.
[02:43:33.831 --> 02:43:36.193]  We have people like Governor Jerry Brown in California.
[02:43:36.773 --> 02:43:44.960]  Who said at UN conferences, I interviewed him in 2002 at the Earth Conference, the developing world can't emulate Western prosperity because the Earth couldn't handle it.
[02:43:44.980 --> 02:43:47.642]  We need something like 10 or 20 more Earths to handle it.
[02:43:47.882 --> 02:43:59.872]  Here you have white, wealthy Westerners telling people of color, 1.6 billion of them, don't have running water, electricity, living in dire poverty, their children dying in infant mortality, living in huts made
[02:44:00.852 --> 02:44:13.935]  If that is not a racist message, I don't know of anything else that is.
[02:44:14.215 --> 02:44:21.837]  We have people, Ugandan activists in Africa saying that Al Gore uses more electricity in a day than they use in a year.
[02:44:22.217 --> 02:44:24.078]  They recognize what's going on here.
[02:44:24.178 --> 02:44:29.019]  India has said they won't sign on to emission restrictions when 40% of their residents don't have running
[02:44:29.019 --> 02:44:29.720]  We're good to go.
[02:44:44.076 --> 02:44:48.198]  But the good news is, the good news is, we're starting to turn the tide.
[02:44:48.878 --> 02:44:58.883]  And if we continue to realize just how monstrous these people are, we can defeat them and stop letting them have the fake moral high ground from their palaces.
[02:44:59.623 --> 02:45:03.224]  And, you know, you're mentioning the death sentence for over a billion people in the third world.
[02:45:03.765 --> 02:45:05.866]  Lord Monckton's actuaries and others have proven that.
[02:45:05.886 --> 02:45:06.726]  The UN admits it.
[02:45:07.106 --> 02:45:10.628]  Over the next decade, if they put any of these in place, they tell the third world
[02:45:11.624 --> 02:45:20.146]  At the Copenhagen event two years ago, right on the heels of the climate gate coming out, that, hey, don't worry, we're going to tax the West and give you money.
[02:45:20.446 --> 02:45:28.128]  Then they got the treaty, and it was right at double the carbon cuts for them that we would have a total death sentence.
[02:45:28.888 --> 02:45:33.929]  I mean, you know, it's annoying if your gas prices go up and, you know, you can barely live.
[02:45:34.229 --> 02:45:38.090]  But it's one thing if you're an African on $2 a day or less, this is a death sentence.
[02:45:38.831 --> 02:45:43.274]  Yeah, even innocuous things in the UK they were going to buy local and not have food imported.
[02:45:43.654 --> 02:45:44.395]  Who did that affect?
[02:45:44.535 --> 02:45:50.959]  Kenyan farmers in Africa rebelled when the UK tried to do this because their livelihood were these fruit exports.
[02:45:51.259 --> 02:45:53.481]  So every action has a reaction.
[02:45:53.541 --> 02:46:03.828]  And what's most repulsive about the man-made global warming movement is the idea, and this was mentioned by UK scientist Philip Stott, it's a new form of colonialism.
[02:46:04.168 --> 02:46:08.591]  It's white wealthy Westerners going into Africa and South America and telling these governments,
[02:46:09.511 --> 02:46:13.834]  You can't develop, you can't use your natural resources the way you want to.
[02:46:14.134 --> 02:46:21.619]  I interviewed a South African activist a few years ago who said that the developing world should tell the developed world, i.e.
[02:46:21.639 --> 02:46:25.742]  the Western world, the United States, to go to hell if they're telling them they can't develop their resources.
[02:46:26.062 --> 02:46:35.688]  Unless Washington and England and France and Germany are willing to bomb their cities and level them back to swamps, wetlands and forests, we have no business
[02:46:35.708 --> 02:46:36.128]  I don't
[02:46:55.209 --> 02:46:58.973]  But China can build three new ones a week.
[02:46:58.993 --> 02:46:59.914]  We get about three a year.
[02:46:59.934 --> 02:47:06.723]  And Mark, as you know, Al Gore, Lord Rothschild, Rockefellers, Oprah Winfrey, they're not stupid.
[02:47:07.624 --> 02:47:12.369]  When they put these global environmental rules in, they admit it, they're all selectively enforced.
[02:47:12.910 --> 02:47:18.056]  The EPA doesn't let new coal plants open that are clean, unless it's General Electric.
[02:47:18.076 --> 02:47:21.800]  What, seven months ago he gave them a waiver, the day the new stuff went into effect.
[02:47:22.100 --> 02:47:23.962]  He gives his buddies health care waivers.
[02:47:24.663 --> 02:47:30.069]  McDonald's doesn't have to buy it, but a mom and pop does have to buy insurance for their employees, then they go out of business.
[02:47:30.510 --> 02:47:33.213]  So really, it's all just about, they say,
[02:47:35.410 --> 02:47:39.674]  What you can do, how you can live your life, and they selectively enforce however they want.
[02:47:39.734 --> 02:47:45.598]  It's nothing but a green mafia, and it's time to recognize them for the Nazis they are.
[02:47:45.658 --> 02:47:50.502]  You study the Green Movement after Germany fell with Hitler.
[02:47:50.843 --> 02:47:53.325]  The eugenicists started the Green Movement here in the U.S.
[02:47:53.345 --> 02:47:58.309]  and England, as you know, Mark, and I've made the film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and they said
[02:47:58.829 --> 02:48:08.115]  They said, we've got to now pose as environmentalist and conservationist, so we can take control of society and teach people they're bad, so we can have one-child policies.
[02:48:08.836 --> 02:48:18.682]  And that's what they've done, and we need to really recognize just how purely wicked and evil these obese, demonic, man-bear pigs are.
[02:48:19.803 --> 02:48:20.664]  Your comments on that?
[02:48:21.536 --> 02:48:33.443]  Yeah, well, you mentioned Germany, and right now the German climate advisor, a man named Schellenhuber, is proposing a CO2 budget for every man, woman, and child on the planet, monitored by an international agency.
[02:48:33.644 --> 02:48:41.949]  This follows the UK proposal for employees to carry carbon ration cards, where the government monitors your air travel, your thermostat, your car mileage.
[02:48:42.609 --> 02:48:47.134]  This is beyond what George Orwell envisioned in his novel 1984.
[02:48:47.594 --> 02:48:56.222]  You have Nancy Pelosi going to China to warn that we need to complete inventory on every aspect of our lives to fight man-made global warming.
[02:48:56.483 --> 02:48:57.624]  They're telling this openly.
[02:48:57.704 --> 02:49:01.808]  Al Gore talks about the climate bill being key to forwarding global governance.
[02:49:02.348 --> 02:49:03.529]  They want
[02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:09.613]  They want that monitor every aspect of your life, and that is not hyperbole.
[02:49:09.633 --> 02:49:13.095]  That is absolute what they're saying, their verbatim message.
[02:49:13.155 --> 02:49:16.316]  And what's most frightening is you have Republicans infected by this.
[02:49:16.556 --> 02:49:27.262]  You have Mayor Bloomberg in New York, if you can call him a Republican, actually bragging that he's helping with, I think it's the NRDC or one of the environmental groups, stopping hundreds of coal plants from being built in America.
[02:49:27.562 --> 02:49:31.544]  Half of our electricity comes from coal, and we're going to be making big people die in heat.
[02:49:31.624 --> 02:49:32.364]  No, it's incredible.
[02:49:34.105 --> 02:49:41.912]  Chris Christie, who's a Tea Party hero, bragging openly, first of all, that he agrees with Al Gore on man-made global warming, and second of all, that he's...
[02:49:44.366 --> 02:49:46.687]  Well, that's because it's a big business for them.
[02:49:47.047 --> 02:49:48.147]  They know what it's all about.
[02:49:48.207 --> 02:49:49.868]  Mark Moreno, we want to thank you.
[02:49:50.388 --> 02:49:54.789]  And as they continue to squeeze, the resistance is only going to mount thanks to you and others.
[02:49:54.929 --> 02:49:56.810]  Our credibility is exploding.
[02:49:56.830 --> 02:49:58.470]  Their credibility is imploding.
[02:49:58.510 --> 02:50:02.231]  And Al Gore is reduced to a blubbering, cussing, man-bear pig.
[02:50:02.751 --> 02:50:04.752]  Enjoy Al Gore's meltdown.
[02:50:04.812 --> 02:50:05.872]  He's earned it.
[02:50:06.232 --> 02:50:08.713]  He is an utter and complete failure at this point.
[02:50:08.753 --> 02:50:10.294]  And he knows it after spending $300 million.
[02:50:11.514 --> 02:50:13.076]  All right, Mark Moreno, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:50:13.096 --> 02:50:15.759]  All right, there he goes from climatedepot.com.
[02:50:15.799 --> 02:50:18.862]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to beat these green Nazis.
[02:50:19.603 --> 02:50:23.087]  The genetic engineering, all that kind of stuff, are serious threats.
[02:50:24.485 --> 02:50:26.327]  The toxic waste dumping, that's real.
[02:50:27.388 --> 02:50:29.009]  Besphenol A in the plastics.
[02:50:29.609 --> 02:50:30.530]  Fluoride in the water.
[02:50:30.610 --> 02:50:31.791]  That's all real stuff.
[02:50:32.272 --> 02:50:33.233]  I don't want to drink poison.
[02:50:33.753 --> 02:50:39.998]  But the people that run the environmental movement, A, keep you away from real issues, and B, it's all about a power grab.
[02:50:40.038 --> 02:50:41.560]  Now, show's almost over.
[02:50:42.748 --> 02:50:45.950]  The Fed has announced they're going to keep rates low through mid-2013.
[02:50:45.990 --> 02:50:49.432]  That probably means they're getting ready to raise them, because they always lie.
[02:50:50.473 --> 02:50:54.956]  You know that we play Greenspan saying that we can just print money so we won't default.
[02:50:55.616 --> 02:50:56.737]  Now, that's an oxymoron.
[02:50:56.777 --> 02:50:58.758]  That means they will default by hyperinflation.
[02:50:58.998 --> 02:51:00.839]  They just won't officially default.
[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:02.941]  The Dow has been up and down all day.
[02:51:02.961 --> 02:51:04.802]  It's down 51 points right now.
[02:51:04.842 --> 02:51:05.602]  The Nasdaq's up 16.11 at 10,758.80.
[02:51:11.286 --> 02:51:12.187]  That's where the Dow is.
[02:51:12.627 --> 02:51:20.272]  But the biggest news is that JP Morgan came out and said, due to inflation, all major commodities are set to go up.
[02:51:20.672 --> 02:51:22.153]  And here's MSNBC.
[02:51:22.514 --> 02:51:34.582]  JP Morgan, or CNBC, said Monday it expects spot gold prices to climb to $2,500 an ounce or higher by year-end or on very high volatility following the downgrade of U.S.
[02:51:34.642 --> 02:51:34.842]  debt.
[02:51:36.058 --> 02:51:41.922]  That signifies the insiders know they are going with the hyperinflation model.
[02:51:41.962 --> 02:51:44.885]  And that's what low interest rates also signify.
[02:51:45.605 --> 02:51:51.129]  Ted Anderson, I wanted to give people the opportunity here at the end of the broadcast, who've waited and waited and waited.
[02:51:51.670 --> 02:51:53.511]  Oh, gold's 300, that's too much.
[02:51:53.611 --> 02:51:54.692]  Oh, it's 1,000 too much.
[02:51:54.752 --> 02:51:55.733]  It's 1,600 too much.
[02:51:56.133 --> 02:51:59.335]  It's 1,780 and then went down a little today and then back up.
[02:51:59.776 --> 02:52:03.378]  The point is, you bought gold and silver in the last few months.
[02:52:03.518 --> 02:52:05.200]  You're running out of it at the lower prices.
[02:52:05.740 --> 02:52:08.822]  And then it's going to go up next week, but then by then it should be up even more.
[02:52:09.082 --> 02:52:10.302]  So that goal will be a good deal.
[02:52:10.683 --> 02:52:12.023]  People need to take advantage of this.
[02:52:12.043 --> 02:52:14.605]  And people also need to know, you've got 40-something brokers.
[02:52:15.125 --> 02:52:16.245]  The phones are lit up.
[02:52:16.405 --> 02:52:18.426]  If they're busy, leave your name and number.
[02:52:18.467 --> 02:52:19.487]  They'll call you right back.
[02:52:19.507 --> 02:52:22.549]  You've got to call to get the radio specials.
[02:52:22.569 --> 02:52:26.591]  There's one way to get one of the radio specials on the Internet, at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:26.611 --> 02:52:32.314]  There's a banner on the right-hand side near the top that says, get two silver coins, get two gifts free.
[02:52:33.374 --> 02:52:39.942]  You get two silver coins, which is way over an $88 value when you have the shipping, with a free book and a free film.
[02:52:40.362 --> 02:52:42.105]  That is, we're talking $40 off.
[02:52:42.465 --> 02:52:44.347]  That deal is available via the internet.
[02:52:44.387 --> 02:52:48.632]  Link through at Infowars.com to find that special page at MidasResources.com.
[02:52:49.113 --> 02:52:51.856]  But you need to call MidasResources today.
[02:52:52.737 --> 02:52:55.241]  Because they have got great deals on gold and silver.
[02:52:55.281 --> 02:52:56.583]  Ted, we're about to end the show.
[02:52:56.944 --> 02:52:59.307]  Quickly, what are the special radio listener specials?
[02:52:59.548 --> 02:53:03.494]  What are some of the gold and silver coins you've got when they call so they can mention the radio special?
[02:53:04.386 --> 02:53:04.886]  Ranks are at 381.
[02:53:04.967 --> 02:53:06.968]  That's a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[02:53:07.008 --> 02:53:09.010]  British Sovereign's quarter ounce of gold is at 478.
[02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:10.571]  I mean, they're $20 liberties right now.
[02:53:10.591 --> 02:53:10.571]  2171.
[02:53:10.611 --> 02:53:11.652]  Alex, gold ran up to 1775.
[02:53:11.732 --> 02:53:13.253]  Up about 20 bucks since I was on with you this morning.
[02:53:13.273 --> 02:53:14.855]  I mean, it just... Yeah, I saw 1780, man.
[02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:34.515]  Yeah, so everything's just going crazy and I need to say it, if people haven't ordered that book and that DVD by now for 83 bucks, there shouldn't be a single person left in your audience that don't have a copy of that.
[02:53:34.896 --> 02:53:39.242]  You buy the two silver dollars and you get the free shipping, free book, and free video on top of it.
[02:53:39.898 --> 02:53:41.199]  Yeah, you can't beat that.
[02:53:41.219 --> 02:53:42.459]  You're not going to find it anywhere else.
[02:53:42.479 --> 02:53:44.960]  But Ted, folks want to get into gold and other silver.
[02:53:44.980 --> 02:53:47.101]  A lot of them have already got that deal.
[02:53:47.141 --> 02:53:48.542]  Tell folks about the other radio specials.
[02:53:48.782 --> 02:53:49.422]  Oh yeah, sure.
[02:53:49.462 --> 02:53:50.803]  We've got a whole long list of them.
[02:53:50.843 --> 02:53:56.745]  I mean, presently, right now, you can pick up the American Eagle right now at $1869.78.
[02:53:56.985 --> 02:53:58.766]  They've shot up 20 bucks an ounce.
[02:53:58.806 --> 02:53:59.767]  I haven't raised them yet.
[02:54:00.107 --> 02:54:02.848]  Like I said, the British Sovereign at $478.
[02:54:03.228 --> 02:54:04.149]  The Frank right now at $381.
[02:54:05.189 --> 02:54:10.330]  Survival bags of dimes, man, everybody should have one of these.
[02:54:10.350 --> 02:54:11.770]  $2,831 delivered.
[02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:15.711]  You just, I mean, you really need to be moving on this stuff, Alex.
[02:54:15.791 --> 02:54:17.711]  I mean, the dollar's melting as we speak.
[02:54:18.051 --> 02:54:18.471]  Absolutely.
[02:54:18.491 --> 02:54:19.532]  Let me give, well, you know what?
[02:54:19.552 --> 02:54:22.952]  We're going to do a little bit of internet overdrive at PrisonPlanet.tv only for five minutes.
[02:54:22.972 --> 02:54:23.512]  Stay there, Ted.
[02:54:23.532 --> 02:54:24.433]  I want to get into that number.
[02:54:24.833 --> 02:54:25.053]  But 800-686-2237.
[02:54:25.073 --> 02:54:25.113]  800-686-2237.
[02:54:25.133 --> 02:54:25.553]  Give them a call.
[02:54:33.766 --> 02:54:34.546]  See you back live tomorrow.
[02:54:34.846 --> 02:54:36.687]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:54:37.087 --> 02:54:38.707]  Five minutes overdrive internet only.
[02:54:38.747 --> 02:54:39.128]  Coming up.
[02:54:39.188 --> 02:54:40.568]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:54:43.409 --> 02:54:44.909]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:54:45.109 --> 02:54:50.171]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:54:50.431 --> 02:54:51.791]  Saving means to make money.
[02:54:51.971 --> 02:55:00.734]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:55:01.474 --> 02:55:08.581]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:55:09.021 --> 02:55:16.628]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:55:17.028 --> 02:55:21.952]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:55:22.253 --> 02:55:24.355]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800
[02:55:25.155 --> 02:55:30.116]  Call 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap dot com.
[02:55:30.396 --> 02:55:38.398]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five star soap dot com.
[02:55:43.159 --> 02:55:46.080]  Coast to coast direct from Austin.
[02:55:46.740 --> 02:55:49.941]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:56:00.956 --> 02:56:03.037]  Ted, what does it signify?
[02:56:03.057 --> 02:56:04.718]  We're down to overdrive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:05.318 --> 02:56:12.181]  What does it signify to have JP Morgan come out and say, gold 2,500 by the end of the year or higher?
[02:56:12.702 --> 02:56:19.665]  And what does it signify on top of that to have the Federal Reserve come out today and say, we're not going to raise interest rates.
[02:56:20.125 --> 02:56:26.088]  From my research, that will only intensify overall inflation, correct?
[02:56:26.510 --> 02:56:30.854]  The only way that they can keep the interest rates down, they have no other tricks up their sleeve.
[02:56:30.974 --> 02:56:38.721]  The only way they can keep interest rates down is by printing money and pushing it into the system by making loans and mostly buying U.S.
[02:56:38.741 --> 02:56:42.065]  government securities like Treasury bonds, notes, and bills.
[02:56:42.725 --> 02:56:45.067]  And that's how they're going to force the interest rates down.
[02:56:45.407 --> 02:56:46.748]  That means they're printing money.
[02:56:47.008 --> 02:56:50.911]  They're going to destroy the value of people's savings in the United States.
[02:56:51.391 --> 02:56:53.173]  Man, I hope people can wake up to that.
[02:56:53.413 --> 02:56:54.173]  Here's another one.
[02:56:54.253 --> 02:56:56.755]  Bloomberg has a headline right here.
[02:56:56.775 --> 02:57:01.619]  It says, Vietnam Central Bank Allows Gold Imports to Stabilize Market.
[02:57:01.999 --> 02:57:07.323]  And I can tell you right now, that's telling you who's controlling that country, not the Vietnam government.
[02:57:07.643 --> 02:57:09.204]  The Vietnam Central Bank.
[02:57:09.624 --> 02:57:15.008]  How many of our boys did we lose during the Vietnam War because we're fighting it for the central banks?
[02:57:15.288 --> 02:57:16.089]  We did it for them.
[02:57:16.169 --> 02:57:19.691]  We're fighting the wars that we're in right now because of the central banks.
[02:57:20.111 --> 02:57:21.072]  And I'm tired of it.
[02:57:21.372 --> 02:57:23.453]  The United States has a constitution.
[02:57:23.653 --> 02:57:27.676]  We should not be turning our control over a banking cartel.
[02:57:27.776 --> 02:57:37.000]  Yeah, we shouldn't be ruled by foreign criminal banks that have signed us on to all of the debt they created so they could buy up the planet and leave us sitting with the bill.
[02:57:37.020 --> 02:57:49.525]  It's like they had a 100-course banquet and then delivered the bill to our house and have a SWAT team standing by of, we don't pay it, while Lord Rothschild and Al Gore get fatter and fatter telling us they want to put carbon taxes on us.
[02:57:50.305 --> 02:57:51.406]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:57:52.627 --> 02:57:56.914]  Ted, again, you've got a whole list of radio specials.
[02:57:57.355 --> 02:57:59.939]  Mention some more of those for listeners that need to take advantage of it.
[02:58:00.305 --> 02:58:12.854]  Well, like I said, I mean, we were talking about those survival bags of dimes, and man, I tell you, people need survival bags of dimes, because these dimes are real silver, constitutional silver, pre-1964 silver.
[02:58:13.154 --> 02:58:21.761]  For $2,831, you're going to get 1,000 dimes that you're going to be able to use as money when everything falls apart.
[02:58:22.061 --> 02:58:24.362]  And believe me, you'll need small gold, too.
[02:58:24.422 --> 02:58:29.086]  That's why I'm so hot on this franc coin, because it's a fifth of an ounce of gold,
[02:58:29.506 --> 02:58:36.692]  And when it comes down to making change, I mean, for goodness sakes, it's almost $2,000 to buy one-ounce bullion coins now.
[02:58:37.152 --> 02:58:39.374]  You know, you're going to have to buy groceries or something.
[02:58:39.394 --> 02:58:41.096]  That's why I like small gold, too.
[02:58:41.516 --> 02:58:43.718]  You know, people should be moving right now.
[02:58:43.738 --> 02:58:45.980]  I mean, we have the Buffalo coins and the
[02:58:46.240 --> 02:58:50.342]  Quarter-ounce coin that we use to fund the Campaign for Liberty.
[02:58:50.362 --> 02:58:52.422]  I mean, there's just so many different coins that we have.
[02:58:53.083 --> 02:58:55.584]  But what people need to do is they need to get it into their mind.
[02:58:55.864 --> 02:58:57.644]  This is not a fire drill.
[02:58:57.684 --> 02:58:58.725]  This is the real thing.
[02:58:59.005 --> 02:59:01.586]  The United States dollar is losing purchasing power.
[02:59:01.886 --> 02:59:05.668]  Even if you have only $10,000 in the bank, that $10,000 might only buy you $2,000 worth of goods in just a couple of years.
[02:59:09.189 --> 02:59:11.050]  No, absolutely.
[02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:11.110]  800-686-2237.
[02:59:11.371 --> 02:59:15.614]  You've been having to go up on prices.
[02:59:16.674 --> 02:59:19.596]  How long do you have to go up on prices on the gold and silver you just mentioned?
[02:59:19.856 --> 02:59:25.881]  Alex, I'm going to be holding it until midnight, but I can tell you gold increased $50 just today alone.
[02:59:27.822 --> 02:59:28.222]  Today!
[02:59:28.762 --> 02:59:31.323]  So obviously the prices are going to be going up.
[02:59:31.723 --> 02:59:32.563]  I can't hold them.
[02:59:32.603 --> 02:59:36.564]  The market's just driving that direction and so it's gonna happen.
[02:59:36.904 --> 02:59:42.446]  You might as well get your position today because I have to reposition myself and I'm gonna have to pay the higher prices.
[02:59:42.466 --> 02:59:42.526]  800-800-686-2237.
[02:59:42.546 --> 02:59:42.746]  800-686-237.
[02:59:42.766 --> 02:59:44.867]  In closing, Michael Moore to Obama.
[02:59:44.947 --> 02:59:46.207]  Show some guts.
[02:59:46.247 --> 02:59:46.647]  Arrest S&P.
[02:59:54.489 --> 02:59:55.670]  I agree with him at one level.
[02:59:55.870 --> 03:00:07.016]  S&P should be arrested for knowingly being paid by the big banks to certify the derivative fraud three years ago, and before that five years ago, and going back over a decade ago.
[03:00:08.116 --> 03:00:14.780]  But the same mega banks bought and paid for S&P, Moody's, and others many, many years ago.
[03:00:15.480 --> 03:00:17.341]  And so he should love S&P.
[03:00:17.661 --> 03:00:20.123]  They're financed by the very same bankers that put Obama in.
[03:00:21.218 --> 03:00:23.360]  I mean, you've just got to love it, Ted.
[03:00:23.380 --> 03:00:26.282]  I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[03:00:26.362 --> 03:00:27.803]  I'll be back tomorrow, my friends.
[03:00:27.823 --> 03:00:28.723]  11 a.m.
[03:00:28.743 --> 03:00:29.944]  to 2 p.m., Lord willing.
[03:00:29.984 --> 03:00:31.645]  Please pray for this operation.
[03:00:31.665 --> 03:00:33.687]  I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[03:00:33.707 --> 03:00:34.687]  I want to thank you, Ted.
[03:00:34.707 --> 03:00:39.671]  I tell you, I wish we weren't right, though, but I can't believe how right we've been, Ted.
[03:00:40.111 --> 03:00:40.371]  It is.
[03:00:40.431 --> 03:00:45.855]  It's been amazing, and I wish I were wrong, too, because I'd rather have my kids have a stable country to live in.
[03:00:46.215 --> 03:00:48.416]  Well, at least we got a live preserver of gold and silver.
[03:00:48.436 --> 03:00:48.476]  800-686-2237.
[03:00:48.756 --> 03:00:52.378]  We're getting into the riots, coming up.
[03:00:52.818 --> 03:00:53.299]  Question.
[03:00:53.659 --> 03:00:57.581]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[03:00:58.241 --> 03:01:04.625]  Author Jose Collazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery, for more than 13 years.
