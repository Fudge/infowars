[00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:05.812]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:07.533]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:09.374]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.994 --> 00:00:10.815]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:12.536]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:16.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.338 --> 00:00:21.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.280]  Welcome!
[00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:45.365]  It is Monday, February 28th, the final day in February for this 2011.
[00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:49.148]  No leap year this year if I check the calendar properly.
[00:00:49.728 --> 00:00:50.829]  My name is Aaron Dykes.
[00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.150]  I'm filling in for Alex.
[00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.771]  He's up in New York today.
[00:00:54.191 --> 00:01:01.797]  We just saw a segment on The View with ABC with over 30 million viewers talking about the Charlie Sheen incident.
[00:01:02.277 --> 00:01:06.020]  Alex will be popping in on the broadcast later to talk about that clip.
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.461]  We're going to play it for you just after the break.
[00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:20.504]  Of course, we're going to cover everything going on in the Middle East, primarily Libya, and everything about Gaddafi and the Eastern rebel forces, and whether or not the U.S.
[00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:23.805]  is going to intervene on a humanitarian or other pretext.
[00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:32.728]  We will also cover the refugees headed to Egypt and also Tunisia, two countries that just got out of the frying pan.
[00:01:33.388 --> 00:01:38.050]  And later in the broadcast, we will have James Corbett of thecorbettreport.com.
[00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.251]  He's going to help break down the Middle East crisis.
[00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:53.095]  And we're going to talk about the rise of global government, which, of course, the Middle East arc of crisis, destabilization, kind of juicy region is a big part of.
[00:01:53.955 --> 00:02:05.880]  uh... but we will get into that later and then in the third hour we're gonna have a replay of cal catharine austin fits and that is all coming up after the break uh... right now we want to cover
[00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:08.356]  Some of the Libya stuff.
[00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:11.457]  Obama's humanitarian conquest of Libya.
[00:02:11.897 --> 00:02:13.957]  That's Paul Joseph Watson from today.
[00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:21.279]  When his predator drone attack kills 90% innocents, President suddenly develops a conscience for human suffering.
[00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:31.961]  Here we have Obama giving the Nobel Peace Prize supposedly on the idea that he's going to end war in the Middle East, but instead he's just gearing up for a wider war
[00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:38.526]  And we can only pray that doesn't become World War III or Iran or anything really big.
[00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:44.251]  We also have Kurt Nimmo, the Libyans say no thanks to globalist intervention.
[00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:55.441]  These are the rebel forces that are held up in the eastern city of Benghazi and they have said foreign intervention would not be welcome, the Daily Caller reports.
[00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:58.042]  They do not want foreign intervention.
[00:02:58.062 --> 00:03:00.324]  They want to deal with Gaddafi on their own terms.
[00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:03.626]  We have, of course, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:04.046 --> 00:03:05.187]  We have John McCain.
[00:03:05.227 --> 00:03:12.651]  We have Joe Lieberman, all working in the region, trying to kick this thing off under whatever pretext they will walk away with.
[00:03:13.132 --> 00:03:16.514]  Right now, they're going to use the humanitarian buzzword, it appears.
[00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:21.377]  An old favorite, if you go back to, I'll bring this up later, Jim Tucker.
[00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:32.460]  has always talked about how the Bilderbergers love those smaller humanitarian reasons, just like the wars in the Balkans, rather than the bigger wars like Iraq.
[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.584]  They had to fight in Bilderberg for the Iraq war, but they love the smaller scale stuff where the U.S.
[00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:48.272]  and the world government forces, the United Nations and NATO, tend to look better as though they're doing something good, but really it's a you break it, you buy it policy.
[00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:53.343]  And they are shifting everything in the Middle East right now, particularly in Libya.
[00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:57.793]  We also have Egypt bans gold exports.
[00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:04.436]  Egypt is not allowing gold, at least for individuals, to go out of the country at the moment.
[00:04:05.076 --> 00:04:18.404]  A decree banning the export of gold in all of its forms, including jewelry and ornaments, was issued by newly appointed Trade Minister Samir al-Sayyad, and it takes effect immediately until June 30th.
[00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:22.287]  Uh, that will surely have repercussions on the world market.
[00:04:22.347 --> 00:04:23.128]  That's in Reuters.
[00:04:23.788 --> 00:04:30.294]  And of course we have Egypt looking to rewrite its constitution as it's currently under military control.
[00:04:30.314 --> 00:04:33.037]  That will be interesting to see how that develops.
[00:04:33.798 --> 00:04:38.042]  Uh, then we have things like DNA genetic pat-down introduced by airports.
[00:04:39.332 --> 00:04:44.960]  And they're going to be using this on immigrants and other people, but we know it's going to spread wider.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.208]  More on that when we get back, and Alex Jones on The View, injecting real issues through the pop culture.
[00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:55.634]  When we get back, this is InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:56.115 --> 00:04:56.816]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[00:05:00.558 --> 00:05:02.159]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:55.761]  Thank you!
[00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:04.354]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.674 --> 00:06:05.275]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.595 --> 00:06:08.737]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:09.578]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.878 --> 00:06:14.422]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.762 --> 00:06:15.202]  It's true.
[00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:20.066]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.386 --> 00:06:20.926]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.207 --> 00:06:24.489]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.492]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.692 --> 00:06:29.233]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:31.855]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:35.619]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:36.139]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.643]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:45.628]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:45.908 --> 00:06:49.932]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.092 --> 00:06:51.653]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:51.874 --> 00:06:53.956]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:56.458]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.632]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:07:03.912 --> 00:07:04.992]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:07:05.212 --> 00:07:09.395]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:15.257]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:07:15.558 --> 00:07:17.539]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:18.319]  They've begun
[00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:18.519]  I'm good.
[00:07:34.764 --> 00:07:39.766]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:07:40.046 --> 00:07:45.247]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:48.388]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.390]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:09.541]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:10.981]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:12.742]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.302 --> 00:08:16.923]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.504 --> 00:08:21.585]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:40.834]  We are back on InfoWars.com, the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:41.074 --> 00:08:44.277]  I am Aaron Dykes, filling in until Alex gets back.
[00:08:44.317 --> 00:08:46.138]  He's in New York as we speak.
[00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:52.082]  He just came off of The View, the ABC show that has over 30 million viewers.
[00:08:52.522 --> 00:09:02.990]  He was on live talking about the Charlie Sheen celebrity, what would be a distraction, but Alex took the opportunity and really pulled a true InfoWars
[00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:32.231]  uh... interjection of real media issues uh... when they had him on to discuss uh... celebrity you know charlie's drug situation and whether it's off drugs or on drugs and what's going on with the show i don't know i do know charlie sheen has been a good friend to nine eleven truth for all these years it was almost five years ago that he broke in and uh... came on this show and raise some serious questions with his big celebrity name and uh... really
[00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:37.999]  Got a lot of people to take a closer look at 9-11, which of course later led to the C-SPAN conference.
[00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.680]  We'll get back into that in a minute.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:50.147]  Right now, we want to play that clip from The View, Alex Jones, on just this morning, February 28th, only a few minutes ago, and we're going to play that right now and then break it down for you.
[00:09:54.278 --> 00:10:17.309]  You just saw a portion of that interview that Charlie Sheen did with ABC correspondent Amanda Canningan, where he passionately defends his lifestyle of drug use and partying, but it all started with a radio show rant last Thursday that prompted CBS to cancel the rest of the season of his hit sitcom, and we just want to show you a little bit of the clip, and then you'll meet the man he was talking to.
[00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.150]  Take a look.
[00:10:19.016 --> 00:10:25.198]  Haim Levine, yeah, that's Chuck's real name, mistook this rock star for his own selfish exit strategy, bro.
[00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:33.261]  Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind cannot process.
[00:10:34.242 --> 00:10:43.485]  Okay, last I checked, Haim, I've spent, I think, close to the last decade, I don't know, effortlessly and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:51.087]  Well, joining now is the radio show host and close friend of Charlie Sheen, the man he was talking to, Alex Jones.
[00:10:51.508 --> 00:10:51.688]  Welcome.
[00:10:51.708 --> 00:10:52.909]  Thanks for having me.
[00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.932]  If I could just say one thing, I've known Charlie for about six and a half years.
[00:10:57.972 --> 00:11:00.314]  He's never drunk alcohol, used drugs in front of me.
[00:11:00.714 --> 00:11:03.616]  He's been completely clean for almost a decade until about seven months ago.
[00:11:04.077 --> 00:11:08.680]  Now he's come off the drugs and the alcohol, which is almost like, you know, being off your meds.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.541]  It has the same effect.
[00:11:09.561 --> 00:11:10.661]  So he's supercharged.
[00:11:11.062 --> 00:11:11.662]  He's angry.
[00:11:11.722 --> 00:11:12.423]  He's focused.
[00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:16.646]  And I know that when they interviewed him at his house, because I talked to him, they interviewed him for about two hours.
[00:11:16.666 --> 00:11:18.207]  And that's a little kind of joke.
[00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.348]  Uh, that's out of context.
[00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:25.693]  He's tired of being judged and, uh, him being held up as the ultimate demon in this world.
[00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:28.014]  He didn't kill a million people in Iraq.
[00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:31.557]  Uh, he wasn't involved with the takedown of Building 7 here in New York.
[00:11:31.897 --> 00:11:35.180]  And he thinks there's bigger devils out there, uh, than himself.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:43.906]  And Chuck Lorre's put out a whole bunch of these cue cards while having management tell him a month ago, if you speak out against four episodes being cut, we're gonna fire you.
[00:11:44.127 --> 00:11:47.249]  Then he starts putting out all of these, uh...
[00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:57.300]  Yes, Chuck Lorre, he starts putting out vanity cards, not just on Two and a Half Men, but on other shows saying Charlie Sheen is dead inside and soulless.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:05.029]  You didn't show the worst one there, and so Charlie's told, we're tying your hands, now we're going to beat you up for whatever contract negotiations... Let me ask you, so...
[00:12:05.894 --> 00:12:11.118]  The question that I have is, so you're saying Chuck Lorre started this?
[00:12:11.138 --> 00:12:11.978]  With the vanity card.
[00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:12.739]  With the vanity card.
[00:12:12.759 --> 00:12:16.842]  And up front had management, according to Charlie, and I've been there when he's on the phone with his management or his manager comes over.
[00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:18.343]  You're talking too fast for me, baby.
[00:12:18.363 --> 00:12:18.763]  Slow down.
[00:12:18.783 --> 00:12:19.944]  I know we don't have a lot of time.
[00:12:20.004 --> 00:12:20.624]  I'm getting on the record.
[00:12:20.644 --> 00:12:21.305]  Right, right, right.
[00:12:21.545 --> 00:12:26.206]  They told him, before he said a word, they said, we're doing this and if you criticize it, you're going to be fired.
[00:12:26.447 --> 00:12:27.927]  And he said, why are you telling me this?
[00:12:28.247 --> 00:12:30.348]  You know, I'm going through a hard time right now.
[00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:31.748]  But he didn't understand it then.
[00:12:31.768 --> 00:12:36.470]  I think they're trying to make him quit or something, so he doesn't have to pay out his contract or the $100 million in syndication.
[00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.510]  I think there's some shenanigans going on here.
[00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.411]  And then they start putting these things out.
[00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:44.732]  Then they start putting these vanity cards out, trying to prod him and push him.
[00:12:44.752 --> 00:12:46.353]  Show people what vanity cards are.
[00:12:46.373 --> 00:12:47.713]  I don't think people know what they're doing.
[00:12:47.913 --> 00:12:52.016]  Most shows have a logo at the end, like a little dog or the MGM lion.
[00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:56.118]  Chuck Lorre has these big write-ups at the end of his show.
[00:12:56.359 --> 00:12:59.941]  And imagine, at the end of the show with Charlie Sheen and other CBS shows... This is on air.
[00:13:00.081 --> 00:13:03.763]  This is on air, saying this man is soulless, this man is dead inside.
[00:13:04.844 --> 00:13:05.424]  Let me ask you this.
[00:13:05.464 --> 00:13:09.948]  Do you think, because from that clip that we saw, a lot of people would ascertain, okay, or assume that Charlie was on drugs again.
[00:13:09.968 --> 00:13:10.648]  You say he wasn't.
[00:13:10.688 --> 00:13:11.809]  Do you think he's... He's taking blood tests.
[00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:14.851]  Do you think he's... I've been at his house when they come in, take the blood, take the urine.
[00:13:14.871 --> 00:13:15.452]  I take care of that.
[00:13:15.512 --> 00:13:16.373]  I was there two weeks ago.
[00:13:16.393 --> 00:13:17.413]  Do you... I hear you.
[00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:18.754]  Do you think he's manic-depressive?
[00:13:18.774 --> 00:13:20.836]  I mean, as a friend, do you say, okay, this is something else?
[00:13:20.896 --> 00:13:21.776]  You guys are missing the boat.
[00:13:21.817 --> 00:13:22.437]  It's not the drugs.
[00:13:22.457 --> 00:13:25.179]  He's actually suffering from manic-depressive disorder.
[00:13:25.179 --> 00:13:27.001]  Let's just remember, you know, Charlie's been a star.
[00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:28.983]  Charlie's been a star for 30 years.
[00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:33.247]  And all people know about is these episodes where he explodes.
[00:13:33.287 --> 00:13:36.690]  The Charlie Sheen I know is a compassionate guy who's really smart.
[00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:38.232]  What about the episodes where he explodes?
[00:13:38.512 --> 00:13:42.996]  I mean, he was saying, you know, this is the best thing that happened to the people who were with me.
[00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:44.257]  They're never going to regret it.
[00:13:44.297 --> 00:13:45.699]  They had the best time.
[00:13:45.719 --> 00:13:48.221]  You know, this is on drugs, tearing up rooms in hotels.
[00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:49.803]  What about that explosion?
[00:13:50.123 --> 00:13:50.663]  I know this.
[00:13:50.943 --> 00:13:54.465]  I don't use illegal drugs, but when I quit smoking, I've had a long battle with that.
[00:13:54.865 --> 00:14:01.388]  I feel horrible for a week, and about a week later, my wife says, please, just go back to smoking sometimes, because I get so manic.
[00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:03.709]  And I think we have a similar physiology.
[00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:05.229]  A lot of people have that physiology.
[00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.290]  He was not giving it up at that point.
[00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.531]  He was on the drugs and booze.
[00:14:09.111 --> 00:14:10.492]  Oh, you're talking about the last few months.
[00:14:10.612 --> 00:14:13.213]  Do you think there's something underlying here that people are missing, as a friend?
[00:14:13.974 --> 00:14:19.137]  I just think that he's somebody going through a hard time, who got clean, and that's why I went out to California to help him.
[00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:25.561]  And I know that it's wrong for them to be prodding him, yes, and demonizing him, and trying to make him blow up.
[00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:27.202]  That's actually what I believe is going on here.
[00:14:27.402 --> 00:14:37.528]  They should all just shake hands, bury the hatchet, come together for the crew of two and a half men, and try to support Charlie, but also Chuck Lorre, everybody else, but understand what happened.
[00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:38.648]  Okay.
[00:14:38.668 --> 00:14:39.488]  So you're worried about him.
[00:14:39.548 --> 00:14:41.389]  But Charlie's tired of being held up like the devil.
[00:14:41.409 --> 00:14:43.530]  We've got the TSA putting their hand down people's pants.
[00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:45.411]  InfoWars.com covers it all.
[00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:47.491]  We've got the banks bankrupting the U.S.
[00:14:47.531 --> 00:14:48.512]  Wait, wait, wait.
[00:14:48.532 --> 00:14:51.233]  Let's stick with Charlie because that's way too much for me.
[00:14:51.273 --> 00:14:54.234]  Charlie is mad because he's held up as unaccompanied.
[00:14:54.494 --> 00:14:56.715]  He didn't steal $23.7 trillion.
[00:14:56.995 --> 00:15:00.656]  We're just here to figure out what is happening with Charlie.
[00:15:00.696 --> 00:15:02.537]  That's what we're trying to figure out.
[00:15:02.637 --> 00:15:06.038]  And he's doing interviews now, so he has a chance to speak for himself.
[00:15:06.378 --> 00:15:07.739]  But they're taking out a contest.
[00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:10.460]  We're not comparing him to Qaddafi.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.920]  Oh, they've been comparing him to Qaddafi.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.262]  Look, I was just saying, I don't think I've ever heard... Let's compare George Bush, a million dollar Iraqi, to Qaddafi.
[00:15:25.405 --> 00:15:27.446]  I think we were here to talk about Charlie Sheen.
[00:15:27.686 --> 00:15:28.847]  I'm not trying to cut you off.
[00:15:28.887 --> 00:15:31.948]  Charlie says you have a right to kill him, but not to judge him, as Carol Kirk said.
[00:15:32.188 --> 00:15:32.728]  Thank you.
[00:15:33.548 --> 00:15:37.370]  You are certainly a wonderful friend.
[00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.390]  Charlie, stay clean.
[00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:38.871]  We love you.
[00:15:38.891 --> 00:15:40.331]  And everybody else out there, stay clean.
[00:15:40.351 --> 00:15:41.051]  Don't use drugs.
[00:15:41.151 --> 00:15:42.092]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:42.132 --> 00:15:43.092]  That's a good message.
[00:15:43.232 --> 00:15:43.912]  Okay.
[00:15:46.568 --> 00:15:47.969]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:48.029 --> 00:15:54.353]  Okay, that is Alex Jones using the media tool for what it's there for to interject real issues.
[00:15:54.593 --> 00:15:56.834]  There's over 30 million viewers on The View.
[00:15:57.495 --> 00:16:03.038]  You've seen a lot of really influential people go on there even though they just cover celebrity news.
[00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:10.183]  You've got all these people trapped in that false world of celebrity news, you know, petty issues of
[00:16:11.143 --> 00:16:13.204]  Who's dating who and who went where?
[00:16:13.624 --> 00:16:18.325]  And Alex directly took it on and tried to interject, bring people back to the real issues.
[00:16:18.785 --> 00:16:20.226]  Torture, secret arrest.
[00:16:20.946 --> 00:16:24.487]  He mentioned that over a million dead Iraqis.
[00:16:24.807 --> 00:16:27.428]  He mentioned that Building 7 was collapsed.
[00:16:28.188 --> 00:16:31.589]  He mentioned how TSA sticking their hands down people's pants.
[00:16:31.609 --> 00:16:38.731]  He's mentioned how over $23.7 trillion have been looted and stolen through this whole derivative scam.
[00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:44.054]  And he mentioned how Charlie is being compared with Gaddafi.
[00:16:44.394 --> 00:16:46.676]  And here we have petty celebrity issues.
[00:16:47.196 --> 00:16:50.678]  And, you know, we don't know what's going on with Charlie Sheen, but we wish him well.
[00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:51.839]  It's his personal life.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.603]  And then we have real issues going on in the world, Gaddafi and the rest of it.
[00:16:57.043 --> 00:17:00.485]  And somehow Charlie is supposed to be of equal weight.
[00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:03.447]  But that's just the cycle of celebrity news.
[00:17:03.487 --> 00:17:04.368]  That's the way it goes.
[00:17:04.969 --> 00:17:06.810]  But I thought Alex did an amazing job.
[00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:16.272]  Of really trying to bring people back around to what's really important in this world, albeit on a celebrity show that covers these kind of topics day in and day out.
[00:17:17.172 --> 00:17:20.793]  But you have seen The View cover other substantial topics.
[00:17:21.193 --> 00:17:27.234]  Rosie O'Donnell really put herself on the line and used that platform to cover a lot of 9-11 truth issues.
[00:17:27.834 --> 00:17:33.175]  And now Alex, live on the show, is using it to cover 9-11 and other issues, really.
[00:17:34.517 --> 00:17:57.633]  And they, you know, they didn't want to talk about the Bush issues, how controversial it is that Bush just blatantly lied about WMDs, invaded Iraq without a real pretext, why we're still in Afghanistan after almost a decade, why Obama, who supposedly is supposed to be ending these wars, is just expanding them.
[00:17:58.133 --> 00:18:02.076]  And, you know, now we see everything going on in northern Africa.
[00:18:02.936 --> 00:18:05.938]  It's just an expansion of the Mideast tension that's been going on.
[00:18:06.499 --> 00:18:12.784]  And so how refreshing for a bunch of housewives to see questions they may not even be familiar with.
[00:18:12.824 --> 00:18:14.685]  What is he talking about, a million dead Iraqis?
[00:18:14.725 --> 00:18:17.207]  They never reported that on the mainstream news.
[00:18:17.707 --> 00:18:22.211]  Certainly, Building 7 has been little reported except in the alternative news.
[00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:31.799]  It's very interesting, last week we just saw Mankow's, or heard about Mankow's interview with Donald Rumsfeld, said he had never heard about Building 7.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.483]  Certainly a blatant lie, but at least he's being asked these questions.
[00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:45.690]  Just before that he had been asked at the CPAC conference what happened to those missing 2.3 trillion dollars the Pentagon admitted it couldn't account for.
[00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:49.694]  Rumsfeld just lied again and said, well it was always there.
[00:18:51.335 --> 00:18:58.927]  The point is we see these questions still being raised after the Bush administration has faded away as they're trying to rebrand themselves.
[00:18:59.849 --> 00:19:04.175]  Even so, we see that those things are not forgotten.
[00:19:06.388 --> 00:19:11.472]  Anyway, being what it is, The View, I think Alex did an excellent job.
[00:19:11.612 --> 00:19:18.297]  I'm sure he'll be calling in as soon as he can to tell us what happened behind the scenes and what he thought would happen.
[00:19:18.317 --> 00:19:23.841]  But you saw Barbara Walters and Whoopi Goldberg didn't really want to talk about the things Alex brought up.
[00:19:23.861 --> 00:19:26.844]  They just wanted to get back to the Charlie Sheen issues.
[00:19:27.424 --> 00:19:32.008]  And that is what it is, but we need to bring up these other issues as well.
[00:19:32.668 --> 00:19:37.829]  Now, when we get back, we are going to get into the Middle East, and we'll be hearing from Alex soon.
[00:19:37.849 --> 00:19:40.350]  I'm Aaron Dykes for InfoWars.
[00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.511]  Alex will be back tomorrow, and we'll be back in just a couple minutes.
[00:19:45.771 --> 00:19:54.393]  Baby, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.541]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[00:20:02.881 --> 00:20:06.922]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies.
[00:20:07.042 --> 00:20:13.584]  But what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[00:20:13.764 --> 00:20:14.944]  You need a backup plan.
[00:20:15.044 --> 00:20:18.845]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.

[00:20:51.591 --> 00:20:53.713]  Asset protection in financially unsafe times.
[00:21:00.248 --> 00:21:01.409]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:21:01.449 --> 00:21:08.175]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:21:08.436 --> 00:21:10.738]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:16.203]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:21:16.403 --> 00:21:19.205]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:21:19.345 --> 00:21:21.467]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:27.632]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:21:27.972 --> 00:21:31.175]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:21:31.355 --> 00:21:36.919]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:38.500]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:21:38.821 --> 00:21:40.062]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:21:40.142 --> 00:21:42.684]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:21:42.824 --> 00:21:44.245]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:21:44.505 --> 00:21:46.887]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:21:47.047 --> 00:21:51.471]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:21:51.591 --> 00:21:52.592]  That's End of America.

[00:22:59.736 --> 00:23:01.717]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:23:02.318 --> 00:23:02.838]  No kidding!
[00:23:02.998 --> 00:23:07.041]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.

[00:23:42.245 --> 00:23:43.245]  The original since 1976.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.077]  I think so.
[00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:24.391]  We are back at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:24.591 --> 00:24:27.132]  I am Aaron Dykes, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:24:27.772 --> 00:24:37.697]  And as we just heard, he was in New York on ABC's The View, talking to more than 30 million viewers, really about the Charlie Sheen celebrity business.
[00:24:38.198 --> 00:24:45.281]  But he interjected as many real issues as he could, including Building 7, the death toll in Iraq, and more.
[00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:48.323]  And the only other thing I want to say about Charlie Sheen is
[00:24:48.783 --> 00:24:53.165]  He's been fighting this 9-11 issue really for almost five years publicly.
[00:24:53.185 --> 00:25:04.671]  It was in March 2006 when I started here at InfoWars, almost five years ago to the day, tomorrow it will be, and it was only a couple weeks after that that Charlie came on
[00:25:05.471 --> 00:25:29.587]  and first went public for 9-11 truth and ever since he put on the 9-11 conference in Los Angeles that was picked up by C-SPAN and reached millions and then a couple years after that he came out with his 20 minutes to the president a really strong and bold challenge to President Obama to address the outstanding questions on 9-11 to not be the warmonger that he was apparently
[00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:31.588]  I don't
[00:25:51.907 --> 00:25:52.148]  I think so.
[00:26:07.023 --> 00:26:08.284]  That could be good for us in a way.
[00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:22.779]  Is banning
[00:26:40.426 --> 00:26:54.658]  But for the time being, we have Egypt on Sunday banned the export of gold for the next four months, a measure bankers said seemed aimed at preventing businessmen and former government officials who acquired capital illegally from transferring it abroad.
[00:26:55.019 --> 00:27:01.164]  An official from a gold mine in Egypt says he was confident it was not aimed at gold production, but at individual exports.
[00:27:01.604 --> 00:27:05.588]  A decree banning the export of gold in all its forms, including jewelry and ornaments,
[00:27:05.948 --> 00:27:06.128]  Was it
[00:27:25.194 --> 00:27:32.462]  In another area of news, we have this whole thing where Homeland Security now thinks it can take your DNA.
[00:27:32.822 --> 00:27:43.994]  In the name of stopping human trafficking and illegal trade of various kinds, they say DNA genetic pat-down will be introduced to airports by DHS.
[00:27:45.115 --> 00:27:49.616]  Of course, it's going to be targeted at foreigners and immigrants first, but we know better.
[00:27:49.676 --> 00:27:52.717]  It's going to come around to affect almost everyone.
[00:27:53.718 --> 00:28:01.640]  Already, the measures at the airport are far too invasive, but the protests really will only expand into greater technology.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:15.399]  Interesting how that works, that when people say no, they don't want to be patted down, they don't want to go through an x-ray body scanner, they don't think that there's a reason to violate the Fourth Amendment just to fly on a plane.
[00:28:16.923 --> 00:28:33.593]  Here we see, even though they're standing down currently at airports, even at LAX and really big airports across the country, they are mainly not doing pat-downs because of all the backlash of lack of public support, but yet they're rolling out these other measures.
[00:28:33.873 --> 00:28:38.276]  Here we have DNA genetic pat-down introduced by airports by DHS.
[00:28:38.396 --> 00:28:41.978]  A new level of invasive screening is scheduled for airports this summer.
[00:28:42.419 --> 00:28:43.940]  A portable DNA scanner.
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.782]  To conduct on-site real-time genetic testing.
[00:28:48.282 --> 00:28:49.702]  Real-time genetic testing.
[00:28:50.043 --> 00:28:57.546]  This technology is being implemented under the cover of combating human trafficking, illegal immigration, and finding missing persons.
[00:28:58.006 --> 00:29:07.751]  But Richard Selden of NetBio, creator of the scanners, clearly states that DNA information has the potential part of the fabric of day-to-day life.
[00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:12.793]  So first they have x-ray body scanners that they claim they don't save the image.
[00:29:13.213 --> 00:29:15.495]  They claim they can't see your naked genitalia.
[00:29:15.955 --> 00:29:16.575]  All lies.
[00:29:16.915 --> 00:29:19.477]  And now they're going to take actual DNA samples.
[00:29:20.077 --> 00:29:21.918]  This is an activist post reading.
[00:29:22.218 --> 00:29:24.519]  We also have a Mike Adams natural news.
[00:29:24.999 --> 00:29:26.500]  And I see we're coming up on that break.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.201]  So we'll just continue on the other side.
[00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:30.422]  But how dare TSA?
[00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:36.723]  How dare Homeland Security first try to cop a field and then try to get your actual DNA?
[00:29:36.823 --> 00:29:39.524]  How dangerous is this technology going to become?
[00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:42.705]  We're going to talk about some of those questions on the other side.
[00:29:42.725 --> 00:29:46.886]  I'm Aaron Dykes, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:29:47.546 --> 00:29:49.907]  We will be back after the break.
[00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:51.807]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.267 --> 00:29:53.888]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.808 --> 00:29:57.489]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.544 --> 00:30:01.684]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:01.704 --> 00:30:08.367]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:08.647 --> 00:30:10.928]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:11.188 --> 00:30:16.390]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.351]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:19.611 --> 00:30:21.672]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:21.932 --> 00:30:27.857]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:28.177 --> 00:30:31.380]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:37.105]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:37.345 --> 00:30:38.646]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:38.986 --> 00:30:40.187]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:40.287 --> 00:30:42.829]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:42.949 --> 00:30:47.013]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:47.173 --> 00:30:49.214]  You can find the video at www.
[00:30:49.955 --> 00:30:51.656]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:30:51.776 --> 00:30:54.238]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.
[00:30:54.358 --> 00:30:58.061]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:30:58.241 --> 00:30:59.241]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:02.145 --> 00:31:05.767]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:06.107 --> 00:31:14.252]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:31:14.972 --> 00:31:19.014]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:31:19.595 --> 00:31:30.421]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:31:31.061 --> 00:31:40.066]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:40.567 --> 00:31:45.610]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:53.174]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:31:53.494 --> 00:31:55.896]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:32:01.337 --> 00:32:04.978]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.358 --> 00:32:08.359]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:13.380]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:19.602]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:19.782 --> 00:32:22.023]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:22.543 --> 00:32:22.843]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:22.863 --> 00:32:23.283]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.363 --> 00:32:23.703]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:23.723 --> 00:32:24.484]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:24.504 --> 00:32:26.824]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:41.468 --> 00:32:43.308]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:48.370]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:57.852]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:14.754 --> 00:33:18.211]  In constant sorrow, he's there.
[00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.471]  Well, the pleasing odor's half the point.
[00:33:24.731 --> 00:33:25.811]  That's the point upon me.
[00:33:26.491 --> 00:33:28.372]  I really like that movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou?
[00:33:28.852 --> 00:33:30.913]  We are back at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:31.013 --> 00:33:31.953]  I am Aaron Dykes.
[00:33:32.273 --> 00:33:34.894]  That intro music is from O Brother, Where Art Thou?
[00:33:35.375 --> 00:33:39.036]  We're going to be joined by Alex in just about 10 or 15 minutes.
[00:33:39.056 --> 00:33:51.160]  He's going to break down his appearance on The View, and who knows, whatever he saw backstage, I don't know if he got a chance to talk with the talent, but he was just on with over 30 million viewers, and I'm on with
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:57.082]  Probably a fraction of that, but we are still reaching millions around the world and having a big impact.
[00:33:57.642 --> 00:34:00.723]  Some breaking news from the New York Times, February 28th.
[00:34:01.203 --> 00:34:03.784]  Obama set to ease health law requirements.
[00:34:04.544 --> 00:34:17.608]  Seeking to appease disgruntled governors, Obama plans to announce on Monday he supports amending the 210 healthcare law to allow states to opt out of its most burdensome requirements three years earlier than currently permitted.
[00:34:18.041 --> 00:34:29.649]  Senior administration officials said Obama would reveal to the National Governors Association in a speech on Monday morning that he backs the legislation that would enable states to request federal permission to withdraw
[00:34:30.967 --> 00:34:54.569]  from the laws mandates in twenty fourteen rather than twenty seventeen uh... so whatever happens in the grander scheme we definitely see there's a great deal of opposition to the health care law uh... alaska among others has said just outright no we're not going to implement this and right now most of the governors are in washington dc meeting with obama and obviously the health care stuff
[00:34:55.129 --> 00:35:02.375]  is at the top of the list and he is at least nominally caved on certain issues we will see how things play out down the road.
[00:35:03.196 --> 00:35:10.842]  But back in this other issue we have DHS and TSA looking to bring a DNA swab
[00:35:11.862 --> 00:35:25.629]  A DNA test, a live, full DNA scan at the airport if you fall, at least at first, under the foreigner, immigrant, we-don't-know-your-background, you're-unverified kind of status.
[00:35:26.409 --> 00:35:28.891]  But how quickly is that going to branch out into everyone?
[00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:33.293]  We're going to see, because we know there's so much more going on with DNA.
[00:35:34.393 --> 00:35:37.796]  Let's check out Natural News, Mike Adams.
[00:36:05.094 --> 00:36:06.136]  Why would they want to do that?
[00:36:06.176 --> 00:36:07.097]  We can only imagine.
[00:36:07.137 --> 00:36:17.048]  Remember, it was Alex Jones who broke the story about hospitals secretly taking blood samples of babies, handing them over to the federal government for use in national genetic database.
[00:36:17.428 --> 00:36:20.312]  The government routinely steals genetic material for people
[00:36:20.772 --> 00:36:24.855]  For its own nefarious purposes, as does the pharmaceutical industry.
[00:36:25.216 --> 00:36:35.204]  For example, the medical industry's so-called HeLa cells, which have been exploited for decades by vaccine and drug companies, were harvested and stolen decades ago without permission or consent.
[00:36:35.564 --> 00:36:39.307]  It's never without permission or consent, and we know it's not benign.
[00:36:39.327 --> 00:36:46.512]  We know there's been a national DNA registry database going on for almost 40 years, I believe.
[00:36:47.533 --> 00:36:53.137]  And what they're doing with that DNA is unfathomable in some ways.
[00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:58.060]  We know the eugenicists will be using it for race-specific bioweapons.
[00:36:58.841 --> 00:37:11.289]  They'll be using it, sure, for a little bit of ancestry and where did you come from and who are your forebears, but they will also be using it in the military-industrial complex to build very specific, very high-tech weapons.
[00:37:12.089 --> 00:37:13.811]  And that is all scary enough.
[00:37:14.411 --> 00:37:24.561]  Back in the Activist Post, the current focus on DNA extraction and databasing is a well-known globalist initiative stated by the UN to register every newborn.
[00:37:25.162 --> 00:37:29.426]  This initiative has the full support of globalist and population control advocates.
[00:37:29.546 --> 00:37:30.727]  Bill Gates, of course,
[00:37:31.348 --> 00:37:37.251]  Who would like to see a universal birth registry that would presumably tie into his universal vaccine program?
[00:37:37.591 --> 00:37:52.760]  Additionally, globalist behemoths such as the Rand Corporation have issued documents that identify an interest in biotechnology for the purpose of population reduction, cloning, to identify, understand, manipulate, improve, and control living organisms.
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:53.980]  That's right.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.783]  When they build vaccines, it would be very useful to have a large sample of DNA.
[00:37:59.243 --> 00:38:00.284]  And where are they going to get it?
[00:38:01.084 --> 00:38:01.284]  I don't
[00:38:16.929 --> 00:38:17.510]  We're good to go.
[00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:46.178]  Um, then you have to get patted down, have your genitalia touched, and now it's going to come to a genetic pat-down, a DNA test.
[00:38:46.878 --> 00:38:50.302]  And they say they can do it in under an hour, and it'll be very cheap, only $100.
[00:38:51.663 --> 00:38:56.007]  So I'm sure that's all the more reason that lots of people will have to put up with that.
[00:38:56.748 --> 00:38:57.649]  And it's just sickening.
[00:38:59.707 --> 00:39:05.591]  But the far bigger news is definitely going on in the Middle East, and Alex will be joining us momentarily.
[00:39:06.032 --> 00:39:12.536]  But until that time, I wanted to read part of Paul Joseph Watson's Obama's Humanitarian Conquest of Libya.
[00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:21.314]  And this is all about how they're going to use these crises to gain greater control in the region, the Middle East and Northern Africa.
[00:39:21.794 --> 00:39:32.680]  It's really all along what they call an arc of crisis all the way from Eastern Europe down through North Africa, through the Middle East, over into Eastern Asia.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.643]  And it just kind of wraps around crescent shape, conveniently encircling Russia.
[00:39:38.423 --> 00:39:38.723]  I don't
[00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:55.190]  Grand Chess Board.
[00:39:55.811 --> 00:40:01.772]  And here on the microcosm to do with Libya, we see, you know, Gaddafi has really kicked in his heels.
[00:40:01.812 --> 00:40:06.234]  He's standing his ground, while the rebels in the east have really gained steam.
[00:40:07.094 --> 00:40:19.398]  We have before President Barack Obama even took office, we warn that his administration would continue to follow the Bush-era policy of bankrupting both America, both financially and morally, with new wars.
[00:40:19.838 --> 00:40:25.200]  But that these conquests would be done in the name of humanitarian crisis, rather than a preemptive assault.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.000]  Because that's the whole Democrats thing.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.822]  The Republicans always go in strong arm, using the straightforward tactics, preemptive war.
[00:40:33.562 --> 00:40:36.063]  But the Democrats are just as warlike.
[00:40:36.103 --> 00:40:38.284]  They've continued all these things for all these decades.
[00:40:38.664 --> 00:40:45.846]  But they prefer to go in in a Balkan style, as the overseers, the globalist friendlies, if you will.
[00:40:46.346 --> 00:40:55.734]  Just overseeing the splits and the regional divides truly and in just the most direct fashion using divide and conquer to take over the region.
[00:40:56.135 --> 00:41:13.030]  We see that Paul Watson writes, the international crisis that Vice President Joe Biden warned Obama would face has now arrived with the increasingly chaotic situation in Libya, forging a pretext for military intervention on behalf of the United States, NATO and the United Nations.
[00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:14.811]  The prevalence of U.S.
[00:41:14.871 --> 00:41:20.395]  military-industrial complex, even under a government that promised peace, was guaranteed all along.
[00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:24.098]  Under a Democratic administration, wars remain the health of the state.
[00:41:24.278 --> 00:41:26.980]  Only the rhetoric behind their justification is different.
[00:41:27.601 --> 00:41:32.925]  By citing humanitarian concerns as a pretext, the Obama administration could send U.S.
[00:41:32.965 --> 00:41:36.668]  troops into battle safe in the knowledge that they can rely on left cover.
[00:41:37.188 --> 00:41:37.328]  I think?
[00:41:58.963 --> 00:42:07.230]  Do not want the United Nations, do not want NATO, do not want Secretary Clinton in their country telling them how to operate things.
[00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.171]  But then it goes back.
[00:42:09.571 --> 00:42:18.838]  I went to the Bilderberg conference in 2006 and 2008 protesting with Alex Jones meeting with Jim Tucker who has been following this for
[00:42:19.918 --> 00:42:20.198]  I don't know.
[00:42:41.744 --> 00:42:51.773]  But they really liked the humanitarian intervention causes in that area, and they're going to use it again in the Middle East, because it's a lot of mental energy.
[00:42:51.833 --> 00:43:04.444]  It's a lot of... Sure, they have good things when they go in strong for the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, but they do have to have a pretext, and simply put, humanitarian is one of the easiest sells for them.
[00:43:04.944 --> 00:43:07.426]  But they really like how it doesn't draw as much criticism.
[00:43:07.846 --> 00:43:14.511]  But war is war, and Obama was supposed to bring our troops back from the region, and he's brought back a token amount from Iraq.
[00:43:14.811 --> 00:43:16.132]  More contractors went in.
[00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:21.516]  But we really see now how he's expanding a wider regional war.
[00:43:21.576 --> 00:43:26.379]  We can only hope it doesn't involve Iran, although we know they've been eyeing them all along.
[00:43:26.419 --> 00:43:30.763]  We can only hope something like a World War III doesn't come up from this.
[00:43:31.743 --> 00:43:33.165]  More from Kurt Mimmo's article.
[00:43:33.545 --> 00:43:44.377]  Following Secretary of State Clinton's call for intervention, a rebel leader in Libya has stated his country does not want or need any help from the United States and its globalist partners.
[00:43:44.858 --> 00:43:47.821]  Hafiz Goga, a spokesman for the newly formed
[00:43:48.081 --> 00:43:55.005]  National Libyan Council and the rebel-controlled eastern city of Benghazi said foreign intervention would not be welcome.
[00:43:55.345 --> 00:44:04.149]  The Daily Caller reports, the rest of Libya will be liberated by the people and Gaddafi's security forces will be eliminated by the people of Libya.
[00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:14.115]  Now all this stuff is happening while there's over 100,000 what they're calling refugees which feeds right into the humanitarian pretext.
[00:44:14.955 --> 00:44:19.739]  We have something on the order of 55,000 trying to head back to Egypt on the right.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.963]  Another part of that balance headed to Tunisia, the smaller country, to the left of Libya.
[00:44:26.484 --> 00:44:33.749]  It really is interesting how those three countries flared up in a very regional context, all having protests at the same time.
[00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:39.174]  We also see there's protests in Oman, really just all over the place.
[00:44:39.674 --> 00:44:40.695]  They're reporting that
[00:44:41.235 --> 00:44:46.617]  Oman protests will not stop the oil flow, at least not yet.
[00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:51.339]  But we're going to see a lot of pressure on those kind of things coming up in the future.
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:45:10.527]  More on the Egypt situation, behind the scenes of Egypt's revolution, I'm not sure I can pronounce this name, it's out of the Hurriyet Daily News, that's Turkey, and they really call out some of the geo-strategic motives behind the Egypt revolution.
[00:45:14.734 --> 00:45:29.186]  And skipping down a few paragraphs, they really talk about how following the breakup of the Soviet Empire, the proliferation of color revolutions throughout former communist countries also appeared spontaneous and driven by the popular will.
[00:45:29.887 --> 00:45:36.369]  However, in hindsight, it has come to light that their organization and planning was funded by the West.
[00:45:36.849 --> 00:45:44.170]  So, all the things you saw happening after the fall of the Soviet Empire that seemed spontaneous, in hindsight, were not as spontaneous.
[00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:49.452]  Will that be the case with Egypt, with Libya, with Tunisia, with the rest of them?
[00:45:50.192 --> 00:45:52.112]  We'll see, but I think there's a good case for it.
[00:45:52.752 --> 00:45:59.334]  They go on to say, rather than spontaneous and popular, nowadays these revolutions have often been called orchestrated.
[00:45:59.734 --> 00:46:04.518]  The people of Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan were all manipulated by U.S.
[00:46:04.558 --> 00:46:12.544]  intelligence agencies and NGOs like the Freedom House and the Albert Einstein Institute to overthrow their Russian leadership.
[00:46:12.904 --> 00:46:22.992]  And we know the same Freedom House, the same Albert Einstein Institute, the same pro-Western, pro-democracy demonstrations, the thing that happened at Columbia University.
[00:46:23.793 --> 00:46:29.177]  We all know they're part of this online Twitter generation revolution that's happening in the Middle East.
[00:46:29.717 --> 00:46:32.518]  So what's this about the recent events in Egypt?
[00:46:32.679 --> 00:46:38.001]  Is the Middle East now being remade in the shadow of Zbigniew Brzezinski's arc of crisis?
[00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:42.823]  In this context, Gene Sharp and the Albert Einstein Institute appear crucial.
[00:46:43.244 --> 00:46:45.865]  Sharp, also known as the Machiavelli of nonviolence,
[00:46:46.625 --> 00:46:57.473]  Or, the Clausewitz of Nonviolent Warfare has written a great many books on civilian-based defense and democracy that can serve as blueprints from popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes.
[00:46:57.953 --> 00:47:03.717]  On the Institute's website, many books, such as From Dictatorship to Democracy, are available.
[00:47:04.798 --> 00:47:10.502]  So they just go into how the NGOs are really working for NATO and Western interests.
[00:47:12.816 --> 00:47:16.278]  And in particular, how WikiLeaks revealed that the U.S.
[00:47:16.318 --> 00:47:21.081]  had been trying to topple the Egyptian president for more than three years.
[00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:23.971]  And so that stuff is just shocking.
[00:47:24.692 --> 00:47:28.555]  And we also see Egypt aims to alter the voting rules.
[00:47:29.055 --> 00:47:34.619]  So while it's under military dictatorship, they are going to rewrite the Constitution.
[00:47:35.299 --> 00:47:43.165]  They have a committee set up, but there's a lot of critics of that committee who are not happy with the way it's been set up and don't think the reforms are going to go deep enough.
[00:47:43.705 --> 00:47:50.590]  So we have this great revolution happening, and people are wondering if a so-called democracy can be the result.
[00:47:51.492 --> 00:47:52.865]  We'll certainly see, but it's...
[00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:55.819]  You know, tenuous at best.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.320]  I read what Charles Krauthammer had written.
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:17.105]  I don't agree with much of what he says, but he's right in saying that everyone has a right to be happy after the first few days of the revolution, but this isn't 1789, this isn't the French Revolution anymore, and we're a lot wiser to some of the tricks that can happen after the fact, after the cause for celebration.
[00:48:18.006 --> 00:48:22.967]  We see Egypt uprising repudiates Al-Qaeda, so says John McCain.
[00:48:23.647 --> 00:48:24.550]  John McCain and...
[00:48:26.135 --> 00:48:34.600]  None other than Lieberman are visiting the area and trying to influence Egypt after the toppling of Hosni Mubarak.
[00:48:35.241 --> 00:48:44.166]  This revolution is a repudiation of Al-Qaeda, Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said after talks with Arab League chief Amer Moussa.
[00:48:44.526 --> 00:48:54.753]  This revolution has shown the people of the world, not just in the Arab world, that peaceful change can come about from the violence and extremism that is now required in order to achieve democracy and freedom.
[00:48:55.373 --> 00:49:07.753]  So you're going to have democracy not just at the barrel of a gun, but at the barrel of humanitarian aid, at the barrel of Senator McCain, Lieberman, and Clinton's design.
[00:49:08.956 --> 00:49:12.417]  Before the revolution, they said, it was thought there were only two choices.
[00:49:12.557 --> 00:49:14.578]  On the one hand, a secular dictatorship.
[00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:18.900]  On the other hand, a fear of religious extremist dictatorship, Lieberman said.
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.821]  There is a third way.
[00:49:21.221 --> 00:49:27.464]  That Egypt has shown the world that it's a peaceful democratic future and that it's inclusive of the widest range of people.
[00:49:28.344 --> 00:49:33.226]  That certainly is very hopeful, but whether or not it's realistic, we will see in due time.
[00:49:34.639 --> 00:49:39.622]  We have Farrakhan saying that the Middle East uprisings will come to the U.S.
[00:49:40.302 --> 00:49:47.806]  and he has called upon President Obama to allow protesters to march, urging the President not to attack innocent people.
[00:49:48.766 --> 00:49:50.267]  I don't know if that's that extreme.
[00:49:51.227 --> 00:49:56.150]  It comes off almost as a joke because you wouldn't expect Obama to fire on protesters
[00:49:56.630 --> 00:50:02.993]  But there in Wisconsin, we do see the National Guard being mobilized to potentially be used against protesters.
[00:50:03.634 --> 00:50:09.737]  And if Obama would do the same, if things spread to a more national protest, we would really see what happens.
[00:50:10.497 --> 00:50:18.561]  Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, predicted on Sunday that America faces imminent uprisings that mirror those of the Middle East.
[00:50:19.161 --> 00:50:24.064]  What you are looking at in Tunisia, in Egypt, in Libya, in Bahrain, will
[00:50:25.104 --> 00:50:27.365]  Uh, what you see happening there.
[00:50:28.086 --> 00:50:32.388]  You'd better prepare because it will be coming to your door, Farrakhan said in a booming voice.
[00:50:32.888 --> 00:50:34.829]  Thousands of followers cheering in his wake.
[00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.870]  Farrakhan...
[00:50:37.313 --> 00:50:42.836]  Again, asked Obama to allow protesters to march, urging the President not to attack innocent people.
[00:50:43.377 --> 00:50:47.899]  And that is what they do in foreign countries, and we only hope it doesn't come to the U.S.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.361]  But we can see the flare point is coming.
[00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:53.083]  And we will be back after this break.
[00:50:53.243 --> 00:50:55.064]  Alex Jones will be joining us shortly.
[00:50:55.084 --> 00:50:57.565]  I don't know his exact schedule in New York.
[00:50:57.605 --> 00:50:59.146]  He was just on ABC's The View.
[00:51:02.776 --> 00:51:03.917]  This is not a drill.
[00:51:04.017 --> 00:51:05.978]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:51:06.519 --> 00:51:08.120]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:15.545]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[00:51:15.625 --> 00:51:19.988]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[00:51:20.028 --> 00:51:30.356]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[00:51:31.016 --> 00:51:32.077]  Any circumstance.
[00:51:32.157 --> 00:51:39.021]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:40.041]  But listen up.
[00:51:40.061 --> 00:51:46.245]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:51:46.325 --> 00:51:48.126]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:48.166 --> 00:51:50.247]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:51:50.327 --> 00:51:50.807]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:50.827 --> 00:51:52.668]  Before they come for your guns.

[00:52:00.473 --> 00:52:08.358]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:52:08.618 --> 00:52:10.899]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:16.423]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:52:16.583 --> 00:52:19.405]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:52:19.545 --> 00:52:21.606]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:52:21.846 --> 00:52:27.811]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:28.151 --> 00:52:31.374]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:52:31.534 --> 00:52:37.099]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:52:37.359 --> 00:52:38.680]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.201]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:52:40.321 --> 00:52:42.864]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:52:43.004 --> 00:52:44.425]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:52:44.685 --> 00:52:47.048]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[00:54:27.637 --> 00:54:28.858]  Okay, we are back.
[00:54:28.918 --> 00:54:31.580]  It is Aaron Dykes in for Alex.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.242]  We are waiting on him to pop in in the next few minutes.
[00:54:35.063 --> 00:54:40.727]  But until he does, all this stuff going on in Libya is really coming to a flashpoint.
[00:54:40.747 --> 00:54:43.449]  We have world leaders uniting against Gaddafi.
[00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:47.492]  We have Obama calling for Gaddafi's immediate departure.
[00:54:47.933 --> 00:54:51.816]  We have old friend Tony Blair who had a close relationship with Gaddafi.
[00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:52.697]  I don't know.
[00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:08.911]  Or on the same scale.
[00:55:09.111 --> 00:55:13.893]  Of course, firing on protesters is abhorrent and in no way defensible.
[00:55:14.633 --> 00:55:16.634]  But then again, Gaddafi is one of these leaders.
[00:55:16.694 --> 00:55:21.876]  He's now the longest serving current non-royal leader.
[00:55:22.536 --> 00:55:24.517]  And there's so many dictators in Africa.
[00:55:24.957 --> 00:55:26.338]  I have the list somewhere here.
[00:55:26.818 --> 00:55:28.419]  He's on his 41st year and I believe there are
[00:55:32.073 --> 00:55:34.394]  I'm not sure how many other, but I've got my list here.
[00:55:34.794 --> 00:55:37.474]  Gaddafi, 41 years, 180 days.
[00:55:38.715 --> 00:55:43.196]  He's the number one for non-royal leaders, longest serving.
[00:55:43.796 --> 00:55:46.717]  Cameroon, Paul Bia, 35 years.
[00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:51.198]  Ali Abdul Salah in North Yemen, 32 years.
[00:55:52.738 --> 00:55:55.319]  Equatorial Guinea, the leader's name is...
[00:55:56.059 --> 00:55:56.119]  I'm
[00:56:15.134 --> 00:56:26.920]  Cambodia's leader has been in there 26 years, Uganda 26 years, Burkina Faso for 23 years, of course not all in Africa but quite a few of them in Africa.
[00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:39.726]  So there is an issue with dictators and so-called presidents overstaying their welcome and of course on the surface it would be nice if countries like Egypt did take on constitutional amendments
[00:56:40.386 --> 00:56:43.249]  Uh, two term limits, eight year total, very U.S.
[00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:43.729]  style.
[00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:49.955]  Of course, it's good on the surface, but the important thing is, who's manipulating the strings behind the scenes?
[00:56:50.535 --> 00:56:56.201]  And with McCain, Clinton, and the rest of the region, uh, that's, of course, very suspect.
[00:56:57.241 --> 00:57:01.123]  And of course we see McCain and Lieberman are asking the U.S.
[00:57:01.183 --> 00:57:08.445]  to fund the opposition in Libya to put arms and money in the hands of the anti-Qadhafi leaders.
[00:57:09.045 --> 00:57:12.487]  And Qadhafi is no one to love, although he is very colorful.
[00:57:13.407 --> 00:57:19.989]  But I think this whole funding the opposition has gotten us into more trouble than it's worth, particularly in the Mideast region.
[00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:24.631]  The prime example would be Afghanistan, the Taliban leaders, the Mujahideen,
[00:57:25.331 --> 00:57:38.878]  Uh, that Brzezinski funded back in the late 70s covertly, uh, so that they could resist the Russians and the Soviet empire, uh, in its way would break down in the graveyard of empires in Afghanistan.
[00:57:39.198 --> 00:57:48.023]  Uh, but it all comes around what goes around that is, and it's our turn to falter in the Middle East in Afghanistan still after nearly a decade.
[00:57:48.583 --> 00:57:51.384]  And now we're going to be funding more rebel leaders.
[00:57:52.145 --> 00:57:52.205]  Um,
[00:57:53.005 --> 00:58:06.311]  After just being criticized for backing Mubarak and funding him and giving him arms, allowing him to dig in for over 30 years in Egypt, now we want to fund more opposition leaders in Libya just to oust Gaddafi.
[00:58:07.772 --> 00:58:15.235]  Meanwhile, going in there under a humanitarian crisis, I think it might be better to take a Ron Paul stature and just get our troops home.
[00:58:15.295 --> 00:58:17.016]  Let's let that region be.
[00:58:17.116 --> 00:58:18.136]  Let's be friends with them.
[00:58:18.196 --> 00:58:19.037]  Let's advise them.
[00:58:20.537 --> 00:58:23.579]  And we shouldn't allow them to shoot protesters, but let's be very careful.
[00:58:24.259 --> 00:58:25.600]  We'll be back after the break.
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:26.820]  InfoWars.com.

[00:58:54.896 --> 00:58:55.517]  Number one.
[00:58:55.817 --> 00:58:58.959]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:58:59.820]  Number two.
[00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:04.644]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:59:04.984 --> 00:59:05.444]  It's true.
[00:59:05.744 --> 00:59:10.288]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:59:10.608 --> 00:59:11.148]  Number three.
[00:59:11.429 --> 00:59:14.711]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:18.714]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:59:18.914 --> 00:59:19.475]  Number 4.
[00:59:19.715 --> 00:59:22.077]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:59:22.477 --> 00:59:25.860]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:26.701]  Number 5.
[00:59:26.941 --> 00:59:30.864]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:59:31.085 --> 00:59:35.849]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:59:36.149 --> 00:59:40.172]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:40.312 --> 00:59:41.873]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:59:42.093 --> 00:59:44.195]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:59:44.355 --> 00:59:46.936]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:59:46.956 --> 00:59:48.317]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.337 --> 00:59:54.221]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:09.425]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.025 --> 01:00:10.846]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.626 --> 01:00:12.467]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.168 --> 01:00:16.790]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:21.453]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.586 --> 01:00:29.107]  I am not Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.367 --> 01:00:30.347]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[01:00:30.987 --> 01:00:32.428]  But I am filling in for Alex.
[01:00:32.668 --> 01:00:35.309]  And he should be popping in anytime now.
[01:00:35.389 --> 01:00:38.850]  We don't know his schedule precisely up in New York.
[01:00:38.890 --> 01:00:50.774]  He's just been on ABC's The View reaching millions with Sheen information but also a lot of very important globalist information about the takeover and the quest for world government.
[01:00:51.194 --> 01:00:55.556]  And of course that is what's going on as we look to the regional conflicts in the Middle East
[01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:59.797]  Uh, current events unfolding every moment, uh, for the past several weeks.
[01:01:00.418 --> 01:01:07.200]  It may not be immediately apparent to the average speculator, excuse me, to the average spectator.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:17.803]  However, there is a quest for world government and it's difficult to understand at first glance that they get more power, they get more control from chaos.
[01:01:18.483 --> 01:01:22.905]  And that is part of the motivation of what's going on as we see protests flare up.
[01:01:23.605 --> 01:01:25.747]  Uh, why were they really Western backed?
[01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:31.891]  Uh, just like the stuff in former Yugoslavia and other parts of the former Soviet empire.
[01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:37.795]  Uh, all these color revolutions that have happened since the fall of the Soviet empire, uh, throughout the nineties.
[01:01:38.275 --> 01:01:45.860]  Um, and especially right now really have all been Western back globalist, back Bilderberg, back new world order back.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.361]  Uh, but it doesn't make sense.
[01:01:47.421 --> 01:01:49.903]  Why would they foster chaos?
[01:01:49.943 --> 01:01:52.965]  Why would they back dictators, but then back their ousters?
[01:01:53.865 --> 01:01:58.489]  It's complicated but it really amounts to order out of chaos.
[01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:05.734]  That is their creed and through deception they will accomplish this and they will gain more power out of it.
[01:02:05.814 --> 01:02:07.055]  That's what we have to watch for.
[01:02:08.216 --> 01:02:14.401]  Of course the big stories today are Kurt Nimmo, Libyans no thanks to globalist intervention, even
[01:02:14.961 --> 01:02:24.832]  The rebel leaders in Libya do not want the US, NATO, and United Nations forces to come in under humanitarian guise or any other guise.
[01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:26.854]  They want to deal with it themselves.
[01:02:27.034 --> 01:02:27.895]  I think that's fine.
[01:02:28.976 --> 01:02:33.221]  We see Oman protests do not halt oil production shipments.
[01:02:36.218 --> 01:02:48.268]  Shipments of refined crude from Oman's port of Sohar are continuing, a port spokesman said on Monday after anti-government protests blocked roads leading to the key industrial area of Gulf oil producer.
[01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:50.610]  That is for now in Oman.
[01:02:51.431 --> 01:02:52.231]  We also have
[01:02:53.052 --> 01:02:55.955]  Saudi activists eye protests, wait for new cabinet.
[01:02:56.355 --> 01:03:10.348]  Democracy activists in Saudi Arabia say the government is closely monitoring social media to nip in the bud any protest inspired by uprisings that swept Arab countries, toppling leaders in Egypt and Tunisia.
[01:03:10.769 --> 01:03:16.995]  Activists have set up Facebook pages calling for protests on March 11 and 20 with over 17,000 supporters combined.
[01:03:18.336 --> 01:03:28.708]  The police managed to stymie two attempts to stage protests in the Red Sea city of Jeddah last month, highlighting difficulties of such mobilization in the conservative kingdom.
[01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:31.746]  We're good to go.
[01:04:01.225 --> 01:04:13.294]  Excuse me the premier to quit the first step toward reforms is forming a new government under a new prime minister that should be capable of running the country and reforming imbalances and we see in Tunisia
[01:04:14.663 --> 01:04:24.352]  First the president left and now the interim president has named a new president and the prime minister has also stepped down with a new prime minister already named.
[01:04:24.772 --> 01:04:30.877]  So everything is changing in the Middle East but overall we can see it clearly is a regional
[01:04:31.918 --> 01:04:48.272]  Uh, tactic to divide and we're going to talk about that more with James Corbett who's coming up after the break and Alex Jones will be popping in as well as we continue to look at the Middle East what's happening and try to understand how they could divide and conquer.
[01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:01.672]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:05:01.712 --> 01:05:08.356]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:05:08.616 --> 01:05:10.898]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:05:11.158 --> 01:05:16.362]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:05:16.542 --> 01:05:19.324]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:05:19.584 --> 01:05:21.686]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:05:21.906 --> 01:05:27.830]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:31.353]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:05:31.533 --> 01:05:37.057]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:05:37.317 --> 01:05:38.618]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:05:38.958 --> 01:05:40.079]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:05:40.239 --> 01:05:42.780]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.961]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:51.622]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:51.762 --> 01:05:54.203]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:05:54.343 --> 01:05:57.344]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:05:57.364 --> 01:05:57.964]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:03.769]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:06:04.049 --> 01:06:05.130]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:06:05.351 --> 01:06:09.535]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:06:09.736 --> 01:06:15.402]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:06:15.682 --> 01:06:17.685]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:06:17.845 --> 01:06:20.528]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:06:20.868 --> 01:06:27.171]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:06:27.352 --> 01:06:29.173]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:06:29.573 --> 01:06:34.635]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:06:34.916 --> 01:06:39.898]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:06:40.198 --> 01:06:45.401]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:06:45.561 --> 01:06:48.503]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:06:48.743 --> 01:06:51.706]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:06:51.747 --> 01:06:52.507]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:07:03.923 --> 01:07:04.844]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:05.185 --> 01:07:08.769]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.049 --> 01:07:11.372]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:11.512 --> 01:07:16.818]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:17.219 --> 01:07:23.486]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:23.886 --> 01:07:29.430]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:33.533]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.034 --> 01:07:38.037]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:38.337 --> 01:07:43.841]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:44.281 --> 01:07:47.244]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:47.844 --> 01:07:49.265]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:49.805 --> 01:07:50.246]  It's here.

[01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:07.992]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.592 --> 01:08:11.573]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:26.428 --> 01:08:29.530]  Okay, we are back on this Monday, February 28, 2011.
[01:08:31.851 --> 01:08:32.912]  My name is Aaron Dykes.
[01:08:32.972 --> 01:08:38.255]  I'm filling in for Alex, who, incidentally, will be popping in later in the hour.
[01:08:39.035 --> 01:08:41.377]  But right now, we go to James Corbett.
[01:08:41.877 --> 01:08:45.440]  Who's an independent journalist who's been living and working in Japan since 2004.
[01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:50.444]  You may have seen his website, CorbettReport.com.
[01:08:50.864 --> 01:08:59.571]  He's been writing and producing the Corbett Report, an independent listener-supported alternative media and information source since 2007.
[01:08:59.992 --> 01:09:05.636]  His forthcoming book, Reportage Essays on the New World Order, will be available for purchase in early 2011.
[01:09:07.217 --> 01:09:19.142]  And we're going to bring him up right now to get more into the Middle East and what's going on with the New World Order in general as he chronicles nearly all the same subjects we do and in great detail.
[01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:20.003]  James, are you there?
[01:09:21.104 --> 01:09:23.707]  I am here, and thank you so much for having me on.
[01:09:23.787 --> 01:09:29.672]  It's an honor and a privilege to be here, helping to drive the tip of the spear even further into the heart of the New World Order.
[01:09:30.073 --> 01:09:39.302]  And it's so important right now, as you know, as the globalists are upsetting the geopolitical grand chess board so that they can put the pieces back on the board in their own favor.
[01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:41.290]  Well, thanks, James.
[01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:42.891]  It's an honor for me to be here, too.
[01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:46.452]  I'm filling in for rather big shoes, but I'm doing the best I can.
[01:09:46.952 --> 01:10:00.276]  What do you think is most important right now in the Middle East as we see North Africa, the peninsula region, and really that whole area just west of Iraq all unfolding into crisis?
[01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:07.018]  And the looming question, will worldwide rising unrest, you know, culminate?
[01:10:08.396 --> 01:10:25.521]  Well it's a good question and it's one that's absolutely vital for us to deal with right now because although I've seen some great coverage of this in the alternative media that seems to be casting a skeptical eye to what's going on, unfortunately I don't see that filtering down to a lot of the people that I see on a daily basis here.
[01:10:27.502 --> 01:10:44.965]  It's unfortunate to me that there are so many people who are buying into this rather unquizzically, just that they're toppling dictators in the Middle East, so everything's going to be sunshine and rainbows and lollipops, but of course we know that this is part of a much, much greater plan and agenda that's unfolding right now.
[01:10:45.525 --> 01:11:00.662]  And it seems to me that, to take a Hansel and Gretel analogy, the globalist-controlled corporate and foundation-funded media loves to create these houses of candy for us out in the woods because we're lost and starving and we've come across this house made of candy.
[01:11:00.782 --> 01:11:01.663]  Oh, it looks so good.
[01:11:01.723 --> 01:11:03.445]  Let's go and eat it and we'll stay in it.
[01:11:04.025 --> 01:11:11.589]  This nice little old lady comes and invites us in, and of course she just wants to shove us into the oven and eat us, and that to me is the analogy of what's going on here.
[01:11:12.009 --> 01:11:22.134]  Of course they're going to create these wonderful-looking events that are going to be all about peace and democracy, even as they're at the exact same time about bombing people, you know, in other countries.
[01:11:22.855 --> 01:11:24.936]  Exact continuation of the neocon agenda.
[01:11:25.316 --> 01:11:31.079]  But most people on the left side of the false left-right paradigm won't really catch on to that.
[01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:38.303]  And it's unfortunate to me because it seems there is a geopolitical grand chessboard and it is being used to play this great game.
[01:11:38.703 --> 01:11:42.585]  And unfortunately the public is trapped playing checkers while the globalists are playing chess.
[01:11:42.685 --> 01:11:45.587]  And if that's the case, we're going to lose every single time.
[01:11:46.147 --> 01:12:04.610]  But it seems to me there is an elephant in the room here and it's a billion person elephant in the room and it's called China and I think that to me is what a lot of this is aimed at and and we can see it in country after country where this destabilization is happening from from Yemen to Egypt to Libya and I've got some articles here that that
[01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:06.731]  That showcase what's going on pretty well.
[01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:14.754]  All news that's happening in very recent times that has to do with these countries and these dictators that are being toppled now.
[01:12:15.694 --> 01:12:18.655]  Of course, all of these dictators are being propped up by the U.S.
[01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:19.555]  and with U.S.
[01:12:19.655 --> 01:12:23.757]  aid and have been in power because they have been serviceable puppets to the U.S.
[01:12:23.837 --> 01:12:29.039]  But the question is, have they been the greatest puppets and can better puppets be installed?
[01:12:29.859 --> 01:12:37.142]  If you take a look at the Jamestown Foundation, for example, they have an article, uh, burgeoning China-Yemen ties showcase Beijing's Middle East strategy.
[01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:48.666]  And it talks about how Hu Jintao has just invited President Ali Abdullah Saleh over to China for an historic six-day summit to talk about expanding ties between China and Yemen.
[01:12:49.206 --> 01:12:53.308]  And it says here, China's stake in Yemen, however, goes far beyond the energy and trade spheres.
[01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:58.110]  Beijing is determined to strengthen its role as an emerging political and diplomatic player in the Middle East.
[01:12:58.550 --> 01:13:04.172]  Beijing's diplomatic and economic overtures to Yemen provide a glimpse into China's grand strategy in the region.
[01:13:04.772 --> 01:13:08.973]  And surprise, surprise, now Ali Abdullah Saleh is in trouble because people are trying to overthrow him.
[01:13:09.693 --> 01:13:16.095]  You go to Egypt, you have Mubarak, who of course was propped up with USAID, the second largest recipient of USAID, so was a U.S.
[01:13:16.335 --> 01:13:21.557]  serviceable puppet for the, not the Americans of course, but the New World Order that controls the American government.
[01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:32.424]  And you can even go to the State Information Service, cis.gov.eg, and you can get a report, Mubarak-China-Africa Partnership to Achieve Peace Development.
[01:13:32.844 --> 01:13:35.706]  And it talks about a conference that was happening in 2009.
[01:13:35.946 --> 01:13:43.852]  Mubarak hosted Hu Jintao and a Chinese delegation as they're talking about expanded Chinese-African cooperation.
[01:13:44.352 --> 01:14:06.572]  And then when you go to Libya, of course you're talking about oil, and it's not so much that the New World Order needs to control that oil for themselves, it's that they need to stop it from falling into the hands of the Chinese, because obviously China is the billion-person elephant in the room, and it's consuming oil at a great rate, so controlling China's oil reserves is an extremely important part of this game.
[01:14:07.052 --> 01:14:08.673]  So you can go to thestreet.com.
[01:14:08.713 --> 01:14:12.013]  They have an article from the 24th of February of this year.
[01:14:12.674 --> 01:14:14.574]  China oil company attacked in Libya.
[01:14:14.954 --> 01:14:21.356]  So you have these spontaneous protests of, you know, people who want to overthrow the dictator who are also attacking Chinese oil companies.
[01:14:21.816 --> 01:14:26.778]  So it seems to me in country after country, there seems to be a certain direction that these are heading in.
[01:14:27.098 --> 01:14:34.740]  And I'm not saying this is the only thing that this is about, but I think that there is some aspect of the geopolitical great game being played here.
[01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:40.676]  Well, yeah, and there's a lot of aspects because you have China also trying to squelch their own protests right now.
[01:14:41.557 --> 01:14:44.540]  People trying to bring in, I guess, so-called democracy.
[01:14:45.001 --> 01:14:46.042]  But that's really the problem.
[01:14:46.102 --> 01:14:51.348]  It's brand democracy that we're trying to so-called export from our foreign policy.
[01:14:51.748 --> 01:14:53.170]  The Bush had rhetoric about it.
[01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.931]  Excuse me, the Bush administration had rhetoric about it.
[01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:57.871]  Obama's continuing that.
[01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:02.393]  And we see that through these NGOs that we know are on the playing field in the Mideast.
[01:15:02.813 --> 01:15:11.215]  And then we have all the revelations that Lindsey Williams brought to the program last year about how they want to stop the oil trade, let these prices go up.
[01:15:11.255 --> 01:15:14.896]  We've seen some skyrocketing already with the oil prices.
[01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:21.578]  But as you pointed out, it's really this geostrategic plan to hold out for the endgame.
[01:15:21.678 --> 01:15:23.099]  We've got all this stuff in Alaska.
[01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:27.342]  We've got more energy there to last us probably for a millennia.
[01:15:27.962 --> 01:15:35.948]  But as you say, it's about challenging China's authority to that energy, even as we have all our own domestic problems with China and the debt.
[01:15:36.650 --> 01:15:37.471]  Right, exactly.
[01:15:37.751 --> 01:15:41.113]  And to a certain extent, the whole Chinese thing is a smoke screen.
[01:15:41.233 --> 01:15:50.480]  I mean, we run the risk sometimes of being so close up to the painting that we're looking at each brush stroke as it happens so that we understand exactly how the painting is being painted.
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:55.304]  But we have to take a couple steps back to see the bigger picture and see what's actually being painted.
[01:15:55.324 --> 01:15:58.826]  And in this case as well, of course, the Chinese
[01:16:01.067 --> 01:16:25.655]  I hate to even say American because of course it's the New World Order, the globalist control over the American government, but the tensions that are going on and the interplay is to a certain extent a smokescreen because we know that the Chinese have been built up by the New World Order, the very same New World Order who have created the economic collapse, that have created the destabilizations throughout this region and throughout Europe as well.
[01:16:26.235 --> 01:16:38.463]  So it's all a smokescreen at a certain level and we know that Rockefeller gave eulogies to Chairman Mao in the New York Times saying it was a great experiment that, oh by the way, just happened to kill 60 million of his own people conservatively.
[01:16:39.084 --> 01:16:43.767]  Or you have the Clintons back in the 90s of course.
[01:16:44.448 --> 01:16:45.088]  Bill Clinton himself
[01:16:45.148 --> 01:16:49.792]  I'm personally approving the transfer of advanced nuclear technologies to China.
[01:16:50.652 --> 01:17:01.481]  You have all sorts of ways in which the New World Order has been building up China, and now you have Soros going around saying China will be the engine of the New World Order, and he even uses that term.
[01:17:01.501 --> 01:17:04.503]  I mean, if people don't believe me, just Google it, just YouTube it.
[01:17:04.624 --> 01:17:05.484]  It is out there.
[01:17:05.905 --> 01:17:07.166]  Soros, New World Order.
[01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:12.550]  He's talking about China being the engine of the new system that they're working to bring about.
[01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:18.774]  And of course it's Soros and Brzezinski and people like that who were behind these types of color revolutions.
[01:17:18.854 --> 01:17:26.420]  So it's all one big circle that unfortunately is drawing us further and further into the globalist grasp.
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:41.411]  Sure, and you have back in the 70s with Kissinger and the Nixon era, all their diplomacy in China was just about triangulating China to kind of pivot off of Russia as they play for control in that region in the
[01:17:42.211 --> 01:17:45.393]  We're just trying to fit in in terms of playing that actual chess game.
[01:18:03.007 --> 01:18:07.674]  Well, an excellent question, and I think there is the near term and the long term.
[01:18:07.834 --> 01:18:18.149]  I think what we're seeing is the beginnings of a quiet, at this stage it's quiet and behind the scenes, but the beginnings of a type of Cold War situation where I think it's going to be about
[01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.930]  I think
[01:18:48.770 --> 01:19:17.669]  It's a very under-the-radar type of Cold War scenario that's shaping up, but I think the longer term, what we're seeing is in the similar way to the Cold War itself, which to a certain extent was smoke screens, because as we know, the globalists were controlling and funding both sides of that phony crisis as well, in order to perpetuate a system where a, there's a constant threat of outside intervention and force, therefore there has to be the perpetual military-industrial complex.
[01:19:18.269 --> 01:19:30.074]  And then B, at a greater extent, when the Cold War really creates the Hegelian dialectic, where you have two forces playing off against each other, and the result is a synthesis between the two.
[01:19:30.174 --> 01:19:37.357]  So you see the Sovietization of America and the capitalization of the Soviet Union bloc.
[01:19:37.377 --> 01:19:39.518]  And that's the same thing they want to set up with China, I think.
[01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:47.772]  All right, we have the music coming in, but we're going to get more into the geo-strategic game that's going on in the Middle East and the other areas when we get back.

[01:21:02.249 --> 01:21:04.451]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:07.333]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:07.793 --> 01:21:12.537]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:12.898 --> 01:21:17.101]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:17.401 --> 01:21:19.722]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:19.742 --> 01:21:22.283]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:22.303 --> 01:21:25.204]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:25.545 --> 01:21:33.148]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:33.484 --> 01:21:38.746]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:38.866 --> 01:21:41.666]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:41.726 --> 01:21:45.147]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:46.328]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:46.488 --> 01:21:47.788]  You're everyone else.

[01:21:59.246 --> 01:22:02.911]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:22:03.312 --> 01:22:08.740]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:22:09.221 --> 01:22:10.282]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:22:10.322 --> 01:22:14.368]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:22:15.009 --> 01:22:28.440]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.

[01:23:01.538 --> 01:23:02.919]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.561]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:23:05.802 --> 01:23:13.087]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:23:13.367 --> 01:23:14.728]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:23:14.868 --> 01:23:17.530]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:22.674]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:23:22.934 --> 01:23:27.958]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:23:28.138 --> 01:23:33.020]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of Heart and Body Extract.

[01:23:42.363 --> 01:23:45.704]  Folks, I did not expect this at all.
[01:23:45.744 --> 01:23:50.406]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Heart and Body Extract.

[01:24:03.527 --> 01:24:05.448]  We're good to go.
[01:24:22.175 --> 01:24:27.437]  Okay, we are back on this Monday, February 28, 2011 broadcast.
[01:24:27.957 --> 01:24:28.977]  My name is Aaron Dykes.
[01:24:29.037 --> 01:24:34.780]  I'm filling in for Alex, who will be back tomorrow, and he'll be on the show later in this hour.
[01:24:34.860 --> 01:24:39.162]  Right now, we're on with James Corbett of thecorbettreport.com.
[01:24:39.702 --> 01:24:46.685]  And before the break, James raised a very interesting point paralleling this back to the Cold War.
[01:24:47.385 --> 01:25:00.151]  And I really think in many ways the Cold War was not only against the Soviet Union, but it was a classic dialectical excuse to invade all kinds of parts of the third world countries.
[01:25:00.831 --> 01:25:08.714]  You know, most of the countries in Latin America went through revolution, coups, or destabilizations in that Cold War period.
[01:25:09.575 --> 01:25:14.157]  Many, if not most, of the countries in Africa went through the same phase.
[01:25:14.637 --> 01:25:29.043]  Many of the countries in Asia, East Asia, all along the arc of crisis in particular, all suffered regime change and real pressure from both the West and the Soviet sphere during the Cold War.
[01:25:31.784 --> 01:25:32.164]  This isn't
[01:25:49.375 --> 01:25:56.942]  They're not communists or we have to invade this country or the domino effect is going to take over and we're going to see communism spread throughout the region.
[01:25:57.443 --> 01:26:10.456]  That kind of dialectic really gives an easy excuse for the US and NATO, you know, to go into these regions and today it's just as easy with the economic disaster, with
[01:26:10.997 --> 01:26:13.422]  The humanitarian crisis agenda.
[01:26:14.004 --> 01:26:16.951]  And so, James Corbett, what do you think about that?
[01:26:17.132 --> 01:26:19.758]  Can we flush out some more of the Cold War parallels?
[01:26:20.831 --> 01:26:27.035]  Well, exactly right, and it's important for people to understand that it's not just a dialectic, it's a completely false dialectic.
[01:26:27.095 --> 01:26:39.862]  It gives people a false choice, so it might lead some people to think that if I'm against the wave of protests and destabilization happening in the region, that that means that I'm in favor of the dictators or something along those lines.
[01:26:39.902 --> 01:26:45.506]  Of course that's not the case, but it makes everyone choose sides in a phony game that's rigged from the beginning.
[01:26:46.406 --> 01:26:49.809]  No matter which side you choose, you're going to lose.
[01:26:49.929 --> 01:26:54.033]  And that's unfortunately the way they often set these types of things up.
[01:26:54.574 --> 01:26:59.558]  Because they understand, unfortunately, that the majority of the public is playing checkers while they're playing chess.
[01:26:59.678 --> 01:27:02.921]  And when that's the case, we're just going to lose every single time.
[01:27:03.021 --> 01:27:06.485]  So we have to be a bit smarter about this and understand that
[01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:22.778]  When the people in the $3,000 suits being paid $50 million a year with their 10,000 watt smiles get on camera and tell you how wonderful everything in this region is, we know that they are being paid to say that because it serves the interests of the people who are paying them.
[01:27:23.239 --> 01:27:27.362]  And it's a pretty simple point, but it's one that a lot of people don't seem to take into account.
[01:27:28.363 --> 01:27:42.547]  So this destabilization does help, unfortunately, the globalist interests that are really in the long term only interested in melding the entire thing into one united world government, which of course we know is the big endgame of all of this.
[01:27:42.647 --> 01:27:51.590]  So again, it's not in our interest to concentrate too much on the individual things that are happening without taking into account the bigger picture.
[01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:56.711]  And I think that bigger picture is revealed in the institutional framework for world government, which is being set up.
[01:27:57.231 --> 01:28:05.732]  All around us and is already so deeply underway that most people would be shocked if they really started to take a look into it.
[01:28:06.293 --> 01:28:18.995]  And that institutional framework is of course brought in through the governmental organizations, the international governmental organizations that are governmental in all but name, from the IMF to the UN to the World Trade Organization.
[01:28:19.355 --> 01:28:25.996]  And it's represented in things like that story about the TSA with the genetic screening and the genetic pat-downs that of course relates back to the
[01:28:26.636 --> 01:28:47.561]  The newborn babies getting their blood taken at birth for DNA databases going into a Pentagon DNA database that Alex Jones has been talking about for 15 years and the mainstream media is finally catching up to let people know about it and they're the perfect example of a system that's being instituted across the world at the exact same time in country after country
[01:28:48.081 --> 01:28:51.184]  And it's being done by secret agreement.
[01:28:51.344 --> 01:28:59.270]  Handshakes done behind closed doors that the public never sees about, never hears about, and doesn't learn about for until 30 years after it's already started.
[01:28:59.977 --> 01:29:00.537]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:29:00.578 --> 01:29:10.966]  It's a coordinated continuity of agenda that was planned long ago, implemented from the top at the United Nations global level, and implemented in the various countries.
[01:29:11.326 --> 01:29:23.396]  And it's very interesting to me that with the worldwide economic crisis, which was caused through globalism, through all these countries being sinewed together as if they were under the fascist emblem,
[01:29:24.597 --> 01:29:25.598]  And how this has spread.
[01:29:25.638 --> 01:29:29.680]  Now we have the price of food is at the heart of the wave of these revolutions.
[01:29:30.021 --> 01:29:32.943]  How will they use the economic crisis to cause further crisis?
[01:29:33.263 --> 01:29:35.464]  More on that when we get back with James Corbett.
[01:29:35.484 --> 01:29:36.265]  I'm Aaron Dykes.

[01:29:50.775 --> 01:29:51.695]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.176 --> 01:29:53.697]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.691 --> 01:29:57.357]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:03.873]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:30:04.233 --> 01:30:08.276]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:30:08.517 --> 01:30:13.301]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:30:13.421 --> 01:30:18.385]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:30:19.165 --> 01:30:22.328]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:30:22.428 --> 01:30:26.431]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:30:28.957 --> 01:30:34.383]  I'm looking for America.
[01:30:34.463 --> 01:30:35.965]  Wear American and be proud.

[01:30:38.888 --> 01:30:42.892]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:30:43.333 --> 01:30:47.497]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:59.536]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:31:00.077 --> 01:31:04.303]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:04.623 --> 01:31:08.689]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:08.969 --> 01:31:09.450]  Number two,
[01:31:09.810 --> 01:31:14.373]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:14.693 --> 01:31:15.154]  It's true.
[01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:20.858]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.138 --> 01:31:24.440]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.463]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.444 --> 01:31:31.805]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.205 --> 01:31:35.548]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:35.868 --> 01:31:40.569]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:40.809 --> 01:31:45.571]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:54.699 --> 01:32:55.159]  Thank you.
[01:33:15.695 --> 01:33:20.919]  We are back on this Monday, February 28, 2011 broadcast.
[01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:23.381]  I'm Aaron Dykes filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.902 --> 01:33:26.624]  He should be coming on at the end of this segment.
[01:33:26.664 --> 01:33:30.386]  We have James Corbett of the Corbett Report for one more segment.
[01:33:30.767 --> 01:33:32.088]  A couple odds and ends here.
[01:33:32.508 --> 01:33:37.832]  I just want to mention that the last World War I veteran has died, Frank Buckles.
[01:33:38.252 --> 01:33:39.153]  The last U.S.
[01:33:39.374 --> 01:33:41.116]  World War I veteran has died.
[01:33:41.176 --> 01:33:43.779]  A spokesman for the family said Sunday he was 110.
[01:33:44.299 --> 01:33:52.729]  Definitely a milestone, the last survivor of that globalist contrived war, which has led us into the paradigm of global government.
[01:33:53.109 --> 01:33:54.929]  For the 20th and 21st century.
[01:33:55.890 --> 01:34:02.491]  Not only do we have protests throughout the Middle East, we have China uses whistles, water, and police on protesters.
[01:34:03.312 --> 01:34:04.392]  That's in the AP.
[01:34:04.892 --> 01:34:10.714]  We have Madoff, Bernie Madoff, tells New York Magazine, government itself is a Ponzi scheme.
[01:34:11.274 --> 01:34:15.675]  And that brings us into how the globalists have used this economic crisis
[01:34:16.195 --> 01:34:21.739]  To fuel greater revolutions throughout the region that will only come back around on the U.S.
[01:34:21.799 --> 01:34:25.763]  and other Western nations, including the price of food and the price of oil.
[01:34:26.223 --> 01:34:34.990]  James Corbett, what are your takes on how they've used our worldwide economic crisis to fuel greater events?
[01:34:35.993 --> 01:34:39.776]  Well, not just how they've used it, but how they've constructed it, exactly.
[01:34:39.856 --> 01:34:49.304]  You can look back, of course, at the repealing of Glass-Steagall and how that created the derivatives bubble, which unfortunately now is just a mind-boggling number.
[01:34:49.344 --> 01:34:54.949]  Whatever it is, however many quadrillion it is at this point, it's more than all of the assets in the world combined.
[01:34:55.029 --> 01:35:01.855]  So, they have this giant derivatives bubble of totally imaginary wealth that they've created out of nothing, which is now
[01:35:03.156 --> 01:35:08.100]  Set to pop and deflate and be the final straw that breaks the back of the world economy.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.624]  And again, this is something that has been envisioned and thought about for a long time.
[01:35:13.084 --> 01:35:29.698]  And again, I would direct people back to Carol Quigley and writing about how the secret agreements reached with the Bank of International Settlements and its various arms, the Central Bank of Central Banks, as it's referred to, and how a series of secret agreements will
[01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:34.862]  Come to dominate the world system, a complete one-world system of economic control.
[01:35:35.082 --> 01:35:45.468]  And of course now we see it during the economic destabilization, the IMF coming up and saying, oh hey, well we've got the world currency that can bring stability back to the destabilized world order.
[01:35:45.508 --> 01:35:48.550]  We can provide a new world order of a new world currency.
[01:35:49.050 --> 01:35:56.375]  Exactly as people have been talking about in the alternative media for decades and as, unfortunately, reality is just catching up to.
[01:35:57.236 --> 01:35:58.237]  Yeah, and it's a real shame.
[01:35:58.277 --> 01:36:04.921]  There's really no doubt that they are building China to be the next global government engine as the U.S.
[01:36:05.021 --> 01:36:08.764]  winds down, at the expense of the U.S., as the U.S.
[01:36:08.804 --> 01:36:19.791]  will be broken by these energy crises, as they absorb all the remaining independent forces of economic, as they take over everything.
[01:36:19.951 --> 01:36:22.073]  It's just really frightening.
[01:36:24.314 --> 01:36:25.095]  Your thoughts, Corbyn?
[01:36:26.101 --> 01:36:28.203]  Well, I agree with that assessment.
[01:36:28.463 --> 01:36:29.905]  It's unfortunate, but it's true.
[01:36:30.325 --> 01:36:31.906]  It's an analogy that I've heard before.
[01:36:32.747 --> 01:36:45.259]  It's kind of like the elite globalists are these parasites that will go and lay their eggs inside of a country and hatch and infest that country and use it as an engine for itself to go out and spread and propagate.
[01:36:45.459 --> 01:36:50.704]  And then once that host, that carcass, that shell is starting to decay, they'll just
[01:36:51.224 --> 01:37:19.029]  Break out and fly over to some some other new host and invade that and and that's that seems to be exactly what's going on America was the the engine for for the New World Order system to move the the ball further down the field and now that now that America is being taken down by design the the Chinese model is being brought in and of course we know the Chinese model is all about mobile forced abortion vans and complete control and harvesting the organs of prisoners and all of this which
[01:37:19.849 --> 01:37:24.294]  Surprisingly enough, they didn't talk about Hu Jintao's recent state visit to America.
[01:37:24.354 --> 01:37:33.162]  No, no, they put up Chinese flags all down in Washington because he's just such a great, wonderful leader, just like Mao was, right?
[01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:48.195]  But then going back to the Middle East, if this whole thing isn't globalist contrived, somebody sure propped up the dominoes in a very convenient fashion so that all this stuff would trigger itself to all come to the surface at the same time.
[01:37:48.935 --> 01:37:55.758]  Going back to Brzezinski and his plans for geopolitical domination of the Grand Chess Board,
[01:37:56.298 --> 01:37:57.240]  We're good.
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:40.689]  The latter part of 2007-2008, really dealing with how Iran would most likely not see a direct military intervention, but really they would kind of circumvent through a secondary route, really a lot of it dealing with these kind of popular uprisings, and it just matches perfectly with this color revolution tactic, the so-called Twitter protest, and they are happening in Iran, and we know Iran
[01:38:41.349 --> 01:38:54.560]  It is the key piece on that area in the geo, excuse me, on the chessboard in terms of getting to that latter stage where China becomes superior and whatever happens to the US happens.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:58.103]  What do you think about the Brzezinski path to Persia?
[01:38:58.883 --> 01:39:09.506]  Right, well it's important to understand that the Brzezinski method is not to attack your enemy directly, but to use the various pieces on the board to your advantage to get someone else to destabilize your enemy for you.
[01:39:09.886 --> 01:39:12.067]  And of course that's exactly what the color revolutions are.
[01:39:12.467 --> 01:39:18.629]  And of course there are all sorts of other underhanded ways in which war can be waged without being directly at war.
[01:39:18.729 --> 01:39:27.311]  And we see that, for example, with the Stuxnet worm that was created by American-Israeli intelligence and used to destabilize the Iranian weapons program.
[01:39:27.911 --> 01:39:39.487]  So, again, there's all sorts of things that are going on underneath, under the table and behind the scenes that are, of course, more important than what we're being fed through the palatable pap of the mainstream media.
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:40:04.833]  And Stuxnet's a very interesting example because it's an admitted tool of war, albeit non-directly violent, but the response to it is that we're supposed to have cyber security at home now, that they're going to clamp down on the internet and potentially curtail freedoms and direct access because of things like the Stuxnet, which we know are coming right out of foreign policy and the Defense Department and, as you mentioned, U.S.
[01:40:04.913 --> 01:40:05.973]  Israeli intelligence.
[01:40:06.794 --> 01:40:07.154]  It's just
[01:40:07.814 --> 01:40:13.180]  Amazing how they build one crisis upon another, and it's all set to react on this map.
[01:40:13.901 --> 01:40:18.386]  And the things happening in the Middle East are happening here at home, too, in whatever form.
[01:40:18.787 --> 01:40:24.333]  I don't know if it's going to be the way Farrakhan sees things, but it's already happening in Wisconsin and other parts.
[01:40:25.414 --> 01:40:37.300]  It's so right, and it's so important for people to understand that these weapons that are being supposedly constructed to combat the enemies, which themselves are being propped up by the globalists, are always also directed at ourselves.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:51.427]  I mean, that's the point of these types of crises and these types of weaponry and all the things that are being developed, is that whatever you see being used against your enemy, at some point, unfortunately, the globalist-controlled governments are going to try to use against themselves as well.
[01:40:51.767 --> 01:40:53.948]  Because that's the way they construct these crises.
[01:40:53.988 --> 01:40:59.250]  So you see Stuxnetworm being used as a way to say, well, look, these types of things can be constructed.
[01:40:59.310 --> 01:41:05.613]  So now we have to create this overarching cybersecurity bill, which, oh, by the way, can let us have a kill switch over the internet.
[01:41:05.693 --> 01:41:07.554]  But it's bad when Egypt uses it.
[01:41:07.634 --> 01:41:09.615]  It's great if we have that option, though.
[01:41:10.655 --> 01:41:11.876]  So, again, yes, absolutely.
[01:41:11.916 --> 01:41:13.777]  Every crisis is aimed outwards and inwards.
[01:41:13.857 --> 01:41:15.117]  It's like the TSA.
[01:41:15.378 --> 01:41:18.639]  Do they really need genetic screening of people coming into the country?
[01:41:18.999 --> 01:41:19.479]  No, they don't.
[01:41:19.519 --> 01:41:20.420]  But what is that about?
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:33.386]  It's about creating the genetic screening control grid based on these database technologies that, of course, is part of the eugenics program, which I know you're extremely well familiar with because I know some of the articles you've written about the eugenics agenda.
[01:41:34.491 --> 01:41:36.672]  Yeah, the eugenics agenda seems to never end.
[01:41:36.752 --> 01:41:41.113]  It goes back more than a century, and we're just seeing neo-eugenics now.
[01:41:41.874 --> 01:41:43.434]  But of course, that's a whole other topic.
[01:41:43.814 --> 01:41:49.836]  But yeah, the DNA thing is very frightening in TSA, and we know it does fit into larger paradigms.
[01:41:50.817 --> 01:41:55.078]  Particularly to watch is Bill Gates Foundation and everything they're doing with these vaccines.
[01:41:55.958 --> 01:41:58.679]  But what else is on your radar right now, James Corbett?
[01:41:58.699 --> 01:42:00.360]  What else have you been reporting on recently?
[01:42:01.883 --> 01:42:18.210]  Well, there's so much to report on, but even just touching on the Gates Foundation and the things they're doing with the vaccines and the way they're promoting this genetic screening technology and all of that, well, one way to look at that is through the paradigm of what the foundations are and how they came into existence and what they're really about.
[01:42:18.291 --> 01:42:23.633]  So I would urge people who have not done so to take a look at the work, the testimony of Norman Dodd.
[01:42:24.193 --> 01:42:34.922]  And, uh, G. Edward Griffin did such an important, such a landmark interview with him in the early 1980s that's now completely available for free viewing on the net, you know, through YouTube or whatever.
[01:42:34.942 --> 01:42:42.328]  And, and people, unfortunately, it's a travesty that so few people have watched it, but just startling testimony from this man who was on a
[01:42:43.208 --> 01:43:01.758]  The head researcher for a congressional committee in the 1950s called the Reese Committee, which was looking into the tax-exempt foundations of the robber barons, the Carnegies and the Rockefellers and the Fords and the others, who had set up these foundations to use as an arm of control, even as they're hiding under the guise of philanthropy.
[01:43:02.238 --> 01:43:07.961]  And his testimony about what he found in the meeting minutes for the founding of the Carnegie Endowment in 1908,
[01:43:09.282 --> 01:43:15.185]  And what they were talking about and how they decided that the best way to manipulate society is to get America into a war.
[01:43:15.625 --> 01:43:20.388]  So then they started deliberating about what would be the best way to get America into a war.
[01:43:20.848 --> 01:43:28.372]  And of course by 1917, they were involved in World War I. And again, it's just all part of this manipulation that's going on at a scale that
[01:43:28.792 --> 01:43:41.062]  Few people would even begin to imagine unless they're really seeking out this information, but it is there and it is available and people need to start using the tools that we have right now to arm themselves with the knowledge that we need to win.
[01:43:41.082 --> 01:43:44.906]  Yeah, and it's amazing how deep this strategy does go.
[01:43:45.526 --> 01:43:56.575]  By the way, we have an interview exclusive for PrisonPlanet.tv with Charlotte Isherby where she does talk about a lot of these Norman Dodd Tax-Free Foundation hearings, but bottom line,
[01:43:57.376 --> 01:43:58.899]  Our country is basically a farce.
[01:43:58.939 --> 01:44:02.604]  It was taken over long ago by these tax-exempt foundations.
[01:44:02.624 --> 01:44:12.459]  It would be bad enough if they were operating independently, but they are clearly coordinated with the United Nations, which the Rockefeller family themselves helped set up.
[01:44:12.899 --> 01:44:17.260]  Then they have their own foundation and the other foundations that seem to do the work for them.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.041]  They come up with these strategies and then they globally implement them in a coordinated fashion.
[01:44:22.442 --> 01:44:35.165]  Top down into these various countries, particularly all throughout the West, you see things implemented in the US at the same time as Britain, Australia, Canada, other parts of Europe, and it's
[01:44:35.985 --> 01:44:37.886]  We've been taken over by these foundations.
[01:44:38.067 --> 01:44:54.918]  What we think is our constitutional government has been completely thwarted and until we as a larger nation wake up to that, we can't get our constitution back because we think things are still going along hunky-dory, problems here and there, but really we were sold out a long time ago.
[01:44:55.438 --> 01:44:55.718]  James?
[01:44:56.439 --> 01:44:57.800]  Exactly right, exactly right.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:05.645]  So people can look into things like the ID card issue and how the UN has had their conferences and come up with protocols to
[01:45:05.725 --> 01:45:05.985]  Thank you.
[01:45:24.756 --> 01:45:25.116]  Thank you.
[01:45:44.548 --> 01:45:44.868]  Thank you.
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:05.144]  Yeah, and look to Egypt, excuse me, not Egypt at all.
[01:46:05.164 --> 01:46:11.650]  Look to India where they're implementing the biometric thumbprinting and the other DNA-based stuff.
[01:46:11.950 --> 01:46:22.120]  And then you've got Gandhi, his whole revolution started being against thumbprinting, being against biometric and ID cards way back, you know, nearly a hundred years ago.
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.901]  And yet this stuff is happening, and it's true.
[01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:27.343]  It's coordinated all the places you say.
[01:46:28.224 --> 01:46:30.565]  Anyway, we thank you for your time, James.
[01:46:30.645 --> 01:46:33.667]  We have Alex on the line, and we're going to go to him now.
[01:46:34.347 --> 01:46:39.951]  Really appreciate your insights as we try to figure out this Middle East and everything else that's going around the world.
[01:46:40.531 --> 01:46:41.132]  Thank you, James.
[01:46:41.672 --> 01:46:42.092]  Thank you.
[01:46:43.653 --> 01:46:44.734]  Do we have Alex now?
[01:46:47.065 --> 01:46:56.671]  Hey Alex, that was a great job on The View, really turning around the popular culture paradigm and trying to get people back to the real issues that are going on in the world.
[01:46:57.371 --> 01:46:58.852]  Tell us what happened from your point of view.
[01:47:00.073 --> 01:47:02.394]  Well absolutely, that was our plan from the beginning.
[01:47:02.915 --> 01:47:07.077]  I didn't know Charlie was going to go in that direction on the show, but Charlie I know is a calm, focused, loving guy.
[01:47:07.457 --> 01:47:10.259]  I think he's rebelling against AA, trying to quit stuff on his own.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.101]  But that's a whole other issue.
[01:47:13.141 --> 01:47:14.882]  You notice it's all over the news today.
[01:47:15.723 --> 01:47:20.807]  The PSA now wants to take DNA swabs out of your cheek to fly.
[01:47:20.827 --> 01:47:25.832]  This is the beta testing ground for total domestication of the population.
[01:47:25.852 --> 01:47:30.495]  It was in Bill Clinton's executive order back in the mid-1990s and covered in America's Toilet by Design.
[01:47:31.016 --> 01:47:32.717]  I was just talking to Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[01:47:32.737 --> 01:47:41.925]  I had lunch with him just now after I did a couple TV shows with you and another, and he was talking about it's incredible that all over Fox they're talking about, wow, Alex Jones is right about the
[01:47:42.811 --> 01:47:43.071]  I think so.
[01:48:07.745 --> 01:48:09.145]  It sounds good to me, Alex.
[01:48:09.705 --> 01:48:13.066]  I'm not on the board, but as far as I know, the levels are great.
[01:48:13.106 --> 01:48:14.487]  I'm getting a thumbs up over there.
[01:48:14.507 --> 01:48:15.487]  Okay, good.
[01:48:15.527 --> 01:48:16.367]  Continuing here.
[01:48:16.387 --> 01:48:21.148]  The Charlie Scene situation basically blew up in my face.
[01:48:21.688 --> 01:48:28.690]  But I'm not somebody who takes something that's a curveball or a wild card.
[01:48:29.586 --> 01:48:31.548]  And, uh, you know, falls down crying about it.
[01:48:31.628 --> 01:48:33.969]  I was... I've known Charlie for six and a half years.
[01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:35.470]  Whenever I go out to L.A., I stay at his house.
[01:48:35.490 --> 01:48:36.531]  I've been there many times.
[01:48:36.551 --> 01:48:38.272]  I've been there for a week straight before.
[01:48:38.713 --> 01:48:39.253]  No drugs.
[01:48:39.413 --> 01:48:40.074]  No alcohol.
[01:48:40.174 --> 01:48:40.754]  Working out.
[01:48:40.894 --> 01:48:41.395]  Only vices.
[01:48:41.535 --> 01:48:42.455]  Coffee and cigarettes.
[01:48:43.176 --> 01:48:48.159]  And so, when he called me and said, help me stay straight, you know, help me fly out of here, you know, that's why I came out.
[01:48:48.179 --> 01:48:48.860]  I hung out with him.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:54.043]  And I said, listen, if you weren't with bombshell McGee and all these women, there weren't Versace suitcases of cocaine.
[01:48:54.083 --> 01:48:55.024]  Mainly it was alcohol.
[01:48:55.304 --> 01:48:57.126]  The cocaine stuff was completely exaggerated.
[01:48:57.646 --> 01:48:58.667]  He admitted that it was wrong.
[01:48:59.309 --> 01:49:02.650]  We're not quite a break yet, Alex, but why don't you continue there?
[01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:23.496]  He was going to come on the air and talk about how he was clean, how he was straight, and talk about Obama not responding to his 9-11 questions.
[01:49:23.916 --> 01:49:26.278]  And right before the interview he said, I want to get into all these other subjects.
[01:49:26.939 --> 01:49:31.783]  And I knew that once he got on air, especially before it began, that it was going to be a serious controversy.
[01:49:32.263 --> 01:49:41.131]  And so what I've set out to do, especially when the mainstream media comes after me, or comes after Charlie Sheen now, I'm able to get on national TV and talk to the mind-numb sheep.
[01:49:41.571 --> 01:49:41.991]  We're good to go.
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:04.363]  That's what we're doing here, and it's like judo.
[01:50:04.403 --> 01:50:24.382]  We're taking the situation and turning it back around again, so I'm going to try to get everything I could out on The View today, and now I'm going to be on several other big networks tonight, back on a plane this evening, Lord willing, back live tomorrow in studio for all the wonderful listeners out there, but certainly we're all about not being in a celebrity.
[01:50:26.238 --> 01:50:40.107]  Alex, I don't know if you saw it, but Media Matters, two days before they blamed you for trying to take attention from this, were saying they demand they mention how you're a, quote, conspiracy theorist, and how all this Sheen stuff goes back to the conspiracy stuff.
[01:50:40.447 --> 01:50:44.210]  They try to discredit everything, but good job trying to turn it around.
[01:50:44.490 --> 01:50:47.432]  We'll get more details from you right after this break.
[01:50:48.273 --> 01:50:51.415]  I am Aaron, in for Alex, and as you heard, he'll be back tomorrow.
[01:50:51.775 --> 01:50:54.717]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:00.680 --> 01:51:01.942]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:01.982 --> 01:51:07.349]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:12.215]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.596 --> 01:51:17.642]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:18.163 --> 01:51:22.866]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.387 --> 01:51:25.308]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:51:25.708 --> 01:51:30.311]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.511 --> 01:51:31.412]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.612 --> 01:51:34.394]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:34.694 --> 01:51:37.996]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:38.317 --> 01:51:41.158]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:51:41.499 --> 01:51:43.400]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.

[01:51:48.363 --> 01:51:51.985]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:51:52.505 --> 01:51:57.027]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:51:57.347 --> 01:51:59.788]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:00.268 --> 01:52:06.471]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[01:54:24.551 --> 01:54:28.035]  Okay, we are back on this Monday, February 28th.
[01:54:28.215 --> 01:54:29.657]  Alex is waiting in the wings.
[01:54:30.398 --> 01:54:32.921]  He's been under a siege of media blitz.
[01:54:33.562 --> 01:54:39.729]  He's been on all kinds of stations, including The View, ABC's View, with more than 30 million viewers this morning.
[01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:44.054]  Alex, tell us what's happening with this media storm and the other issues you want to cover.
[01:54:44.741 --> 01:54:48.204]  Well, I completely dominated all the view hosts, as you saw.
[01:54:48.224 --> 01:54:50.146]  I shut them down, dominated them.
[01:54:50.166 --> 01:54:52.788]  I talked to the Ed producer, he said they've never been shut down like that.
[01:54:53.249 --> 01:54:55.090]  But they have like instant rating numbers coming in.
[01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:56.291]  They said it was off the charts.
[01:54:56.732 --> 01:54:58.073]  They were super excited about it.
[01:54:58.453 --> 01:55:02.357]  And of course, the crowd, the in-studio audience loved hearing about it.
[01:55:03.309 --> 01:55:05.090]  Building 7 being blown up, how the government did it.
[01:55:05.110 --> 01:55:09.492]  They love hearing about DSA attacking the American people, our slave training.
[01:55:09.512 --> 01:55:13.633]  They love hearing about George W. Bush being a war criminal.
[01:55:13.653 --> 01:55:15.174]  They love me going after Hasselhoff.
[01:55:15.674 --> 01:55:18.075]  Barbara Walters almost had a heart attack.
[01:55:18.195 --> 01:55:19.676]  She was so mad.
[01:55:19.696 --> 01:55:21.257]  I thought she was going to have a heart attack.
[01:55:21.737 --> 01:55:25.058]  So certainly, again, no weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:55:25.578 --> 01:55:28.840]  I was completely blindsided by Charlie, but I know why Charlie's so upset.
[01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:33.568]  They keep putting out these vanity cards while he was away getting better.
[01:55:33.588 --> 01:55:35.071]  Getting clean.
[01:55:35.572 --> 01:55:37.275]  Saying, you know, he's dead inside.
[01:55:37.696 --> 01:55:38.698]  Chuck Lorre's going to outlive him.
[01:55:38.718 --> 01:55:39.740]  There's a whole bunch of these things.
[01:55:40.425 --> 01:55:47.649]  And it's basically, I think, a way to get him to quit from paying all these, you know, tens of millions of dollars that are coming out of his syndication.
[01:55:48.289 --> 01:55:52.371]  And so Charlie is somebody who's coming off addiction after years of being clean.
[01:55:52.791 --> 01:55:54.012]  He's detoxing right now.
[01:55:54.052 --> 01:55:54.912]  He's very manic.
[01:55:55.593 --> 01:55:58.794]  And I know he interviewed 2020 NBC.
[01:55:59.114 --> 01:56:02.056]  They did hours and hours of interviews, and he gets sick of being judged.
[01:56:02.696 --> 01:56:04.637]  And so he just basically makes a joke about it all.
[01:56:04.997 --> 01:56:08.199]  But, you know, he knows it's not good, and he's trying to change his life.
[01:56:08.499 --> 01:56:09.840]  But my issue on the show was,
[01:56:10.771 --> 01:56:13.192]  Charlie's been my friend.
[01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:17.355]  I got him on the show to dispel rumors that weren't true.
[01:56:18.215 --> 01:56:22.517]  I got him on the show to talk about the fact that I've seen him blood tested, urine tested, and he was clean.
[01:56:22.537 --> 01:56:23.138]  He's not done that.
[01:56:23.158 --> 01:56:26.179]  You know, four mainstream news, they've tested, he's totally clean.
[01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:28.861]  And then he kind of went off on a tangent on other issues.
[01:56:29.201 --> 01:56:31.263]  Because he had a fight with his ex-wife the night before.
[01:56:31.283 --> 01:56:33.604]  So this isn't even about Charlie Sheen or Alex Jones.
[01:56:33.624 --> 01:56:38.147]  It's about the information, and it's the greatest example I know, of culture jamming.
[01:56:38.528 --> 01:56:44.252]  Whereas they would just be talking about all this, instead they're hearing information about the New World Order, about 9-11.
[01:56:44.752 --> 01:56:46.493]  These are all these housewives and people.
[01:56:46.834 --> 01:56:50.416]  When we came in this morning and saw the line to go to The View, it was about 98% women.
[01:56:50.676 --> 01:56:55.360]  These are people who've never been exposed to these real issues, who are now actually being
[01:56:56.113 --> 01:56:56.554]  I don't know.
[01:57:08.547 --> 01:57:16.290]  It's a real issue, so we're very, very thankful because I was completely blindsided by what happened last Thursday because I never heard Charlie like that.
[01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:19.311]  But again, he's in a very fired up, manic phase.
[01:57:19.351 --> 01:57:20.972]  He's tired of apologizing to people.
[01:57:20.992 --> 01:57:22.552]  He's tired of being demonized.
[01:57:23.193 --> 01:57:31.916]  And, you know, here's a guy turning down what could potentially be about $100 million of syndication next season as well, just in his boss's face.
[01:57:32.596 --> 01:57:37.158]  But when I got on the airplane to fly here Sunday to New York City,
[01:57:37.892 --> 01:57:41.894]  A few people knew who I was on the plane, but other people were going, winning, winning!
[01:57:41.914 --> 01:57:45.836]  There was like a professional football player in front of me.
[01:57:45.936 --> 01:57:47.437]  One of the biggest banks in the country was there.
[01:57:47.517 --> 01:57:52.780]  I had like a three-hour argument with him about the New World Order as we were flying to New York.
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.782]  And so the point is, it's kind of like Chuck Norris facts.
[01:57:55.822 --> 01:57:59.204]  Chuck Norris, when he does a push-up, he doesn't move.
[01:57:59.244 --> 01:57:59.864]  The Earth does.
[01:58:00.184 --> 01:58:03.566]  Now there's all these Charlie Sheen type Chuck Norris isms.
[01:58:04.066 --> 01:58:04.787]  We're good to go.
[01:58:30.563 --> 01:58:32.064]  We'll be right back Alex.
[01:58:32.104 --> 01:58:34.545]  We're hitting that break and we're going to be on the other side.
[01:58:35.445 --> 01:58:36.426]  InfoWars.com.

[01:58:51.747 --> 01:58:55.368]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:55.769 --> 01:58:58.770]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.010 --> 01:59:03.772]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:03.792 --> 01:59:10.014]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.174 --> 01:59:12.435]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:12.975 --> 01:59:13.255]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:13.275 --> 01:59:13.695]  Bernanke?
[01:59:13.795 --> 01:59:14.375]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:14.395 --> 01:59:15.096]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:15.116 --> 01:59:17.236]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.701]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.002 --> 01:59:38.765]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.145 --> 01:59:49.092]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:00:05.171 --> 02:00:09.353]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.993 --> 02:00:10.793]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.593 --> 02:00:12.534]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.134 --> 02:00:16.775]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.315 --> 02:00:21.377]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.112 --> 02:00:24.853]  Okay, we do have Alex right here.
[02:00:24.953 --> 02:00:32.538]  I'm Aaron Dykes sitting in, and we're going to finish up with Alex, what he saw on The View this morning, and everything else.
[02:00:32.779 --> 02:00:34.780]  I've got at least a few reports.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:45.127]  We've seen some blogs trying to attack you and Charlie, Alex, but the comments themselves are almost exclusively positive, defending Alex Jones InfoWars.
[02:00:45.908 --> 02:00:47.769]  So hopefully this was an important impact.
[02:00:49.735 --> 02:00:50.616]  We're good to go.
[02:01:09.346 --> 02:01:12.128]  Apparently Rumsfeld himself hasn't even heard about that.
[02:01:33.732 --> 02:01:34.433]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:01:34.753 --> 02:01:40.157]  Where would you hear about $23.7 trillion missing from the Spartan Bank?
[02:01:40.177 --> 02:01:42.539]  Where would you hear about a million dead Iraqis?
[02:01:42.960 --> 02:01:46.283]  Where would you hear about the TSA putting their hands on people's pants?
[02:01:46.323 --> 02:01:49.565]  I mean, I jammed it in there so an audience would never hear about that.
[02:01:49.686 --> 02:01:53.449]  I read a couple other big national TV interviews coming up where I'm going to do the same thing.
[02:01:54.369 --> 02:02:02.315]  Unfortunately, their tapes are not live, but I'll do my best to just basically cover nothing but, you know, anti-New World Order information and break in on this transmission.
[02:02:02.376 --> 02:02:03.957]  I had no intention for any of this to happen.
[02:02:03.977 --> 02:02:08.020]  I thought Charlie was going on about, you know, being clean and talking about the New World Order.
[02:02:08.080 --> 02:02:17.627]  But, you know, the bottom line is people love Judge Charlie, who's certainly no, you know, angel, but 35 years of him being a big star, they only focus in on the lapses he's had and the problems he's had.
[02:02:17.707 --> 02:02:18.588]  I know him as a good guy.
[02:02:19.208 --> 02:02:19.889]  That's my friend.
[02:02:19.909 --> 02:02:20.609]  I had him on.
[02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:22.510]  He did an extreme interview I wasn't expecting.
[02:02:22.530 --> 02:02:24.752]  And I can't, you know, make apologies for that.
[02:02:25.352 --> 02:02:26.833]  But bottom line, we've had a huge effect.
[02:02:26.853 --> 02:02:32.137]  At first, Media Matters, you know, four or five days ago, says, I dare the media not point out he's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:02:32.577 --> 02:02:37.421]  Then I start going on the air, talking about real issues, and they say, oh my gosh, media, don't have him on, don't have him on.
[02:02:37.441 --> 02:02:40.743]  In fact, I was going to go on Oberman, whoever the new guy is that does the show.
[02:02:40.763 --> 02:02:42.965]  I was going to go on that slot on MSNBC.
[02:02:43.305 --> 02:02:44.626]  And Media Matters made phone calls.
[02:02:45.279 --> 02:02:46.120]  We're good to go.
[02:02:57.979 --> 02:03:00.561]  To keep me off of the air, but they can't stop the signal.
[02:03:00.581 --> 02:03:01.922]  They can't stop our radio listeners.
[02:03:02.222 --> 02:03:07.326]  They can't stop all the great info warriors, and we are change people out there that are taking action like yourself, Aaron.
[02:03:07.746 --> 02:03:14.471]  I just salute everybody out there who's been battling the globalists and Lord willing, I'll be back in studio live tomorrow.
[02:03:14.511 --> 02:03:18.174]  Coming up, Captain Bronson says key intel on what's happening on the economy.
[02:03:18.194 --> 02:03:25.159]  We'll continue to stay focused on the issues here from the heart of the beast, New World Order capital, New York City, New York.
[02:03:26.139 --> 02:03:26.940]  That's right, Alex.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:30.364]  And as far as Sheen himself, he's always been controversial.
[02:03:30.404 --> 02:03:33.247]  He's always had a microscope on his life.
[02:03:33.887 --> 02:03:39.193]  But he boldly came out for 9-11 five years ago, and he knew they were going to attack him.
[02:03:39.213 --> 02:03:40.494]  They've been waiting to attack him.
[02:03:40.835 --> 02:03:42.997]  They've threatened him on air, and he did it anyway.
[02:03:45.856 --> 02:03:46.737]  We're good to go.
[02:04:12.114 --> 02:04:15.560]  Everybody, Alex Jones signing off from New York City, Times Square.
[02:04:15.940 --> 02:04:17.583]  We are in the face of the beast.
[02:04:17.643 --> 02:04:18.304]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:04:21.397 --> 02:04:24.279]  We thank you, Alex, and we wish you safe journeys back.
[02:04:24.339 --> 02:04:27.422]  Hopefully you'll be on tomorrow, Lord willing, as you say.
[02:04:28.102 --> 02:04:30.004]  And we covered a lot of key intel.
[02:04:30.024 --> 02:04:34.968]  We don't have all the answers, but we do know they're trying to destabilize the Mideast region.
[02:04:35.068 --> 02:04:37.610]  We know they have their sights set on the U.S.
[02:04:37.670 --> 02:04:38.190]  economy.
[02:04:38.530 --> 02:04:41.232]  We try to break it down when we come back and The View.
[02:04:41.593 --> 02:04:42.994]  Katharine Austen Fitz, coming up.
[02:04:43.555 --> 02:04:45.758]  And Mideast breakdown in the replay.
[02:04:45.798 --> 02:04:48.923]  This is InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:04:49.304 --> 02:04:50.646]  I'm Aaron Dyk sitting in.
[02:04:50.967 --> 02:04:52.549]  Don't forget to visit the websites.
[02:04:52.910 --> 02:04:53.911]  We'll be back tomorrow.
