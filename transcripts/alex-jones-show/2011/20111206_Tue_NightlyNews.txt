[00:00:23.686 --> 00:00:30.189]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to an extremely important edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.010]  It is Tuesday, December 6, 2011.
[00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:45.776]  And this is going to be a huge show tonight with so many incredibly important topics covered.
[00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:52.219]  And normally I would mention some of what's coming up, but the news we've got tonight is so incredibly
[00:00:54.895 --> 00:01:05.038]  devastating to our republic and is breaking as we speak that I'm going to cover our top story obviously first here before getting into any of the other news.
[00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:24.284]  I'm holding here in my hand a document that just went up minutes ago at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and we've called the numbers involved, we've checked the individuals listed in this document and the accompanying emails and it is authentic
[00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:29.249]  Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton.
[00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.234]  The story is at InfoWars.com and is breaking at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:46.560]  The headline by Curt Nemo at InfoWars.com is, Exclusive Government Activating FEMA Camps Across the United States.
[00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.463]  Now, in 2006, it was in the Houston Chronicle and Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:51.283 --> 00:02:03.527]  That they got a three hundred plus million dollar contract to build three one million person camps for political dissidents, illegal immigrants, you name it, for economic collapse.
[00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:09.729]  They've introduced legislation to fund more of this and to bring it out in the open.
[00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:18.352]  The Emergency Centers Establishment Act last year that got so much attention that says that they will intern entire families in these facilities.
[00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:29.964]  It also came out earlier in the year that the Army and other private groups are trying to hire around a hundred thousand internment specialists.
[00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:34.428]  When you read, it's domestic and international prison guards.
[00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.791]  And of course our so-called government has camps all over
[00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:39.513]  The world.
[00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:48.699]  Kellogg Brown and Root has been caught with its main company, Halliburton, running slave labor camps in the Philippines and other areas.
[00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.320]  That's in the Chicago Tribune.
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.202]  You cannot make this magnitude of information up.
[00:02:53.702 --> 00:03:01.127]  It is the mainstream media's job, and other people, Comedy Central and others that make fun of us, they did last night, to actually go research this.
[00:03:01.148 --> 00:03:04.110]  This is not a joke, and you'll be seen in history
[00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.473]  Whether we defeat this or it goes through, as sympathizers basically with the likes of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, this is not a joke.
[00:03:14.054 --> 00:03:15.074]  This is not a game.
[00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:21.557]  And the detailed article that Kurt Nemo and I put together today goes through all of this information.
[00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:26.218]  We were sent this by a state employee involved in the program.
[00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:27.279]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:32.006]  And it was basically a hidden link on the KBR site.
[00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:36.127]  We're able to confirm it is there on the KBR site, a non-published link.
[00:03:36.588 --> 00:03:39.289]  And that is in our article where we got the link from and everything else.
[00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.830]  Just unbelievable information here.
[00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.812]  And it says that they need people to set up barbed wire fences and barricades.
[00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:59.160]  And I've been to urban warfare drills across the country where the Marines and the Army practice taking on the American people and do set up the barricades in the towns and the cities and around the camps.
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.401]  Now, again, I want to explain.
[00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:02.781]  These camps are already built.
[00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:04.662]  They admit they're the old military bases.
[00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:19.048]  Now they are preparing, in all 50 states, to activate the camps with laundry, guards, people cooking the food, sentries.
[00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:31.913]  And we've got all the video and photos they've released on the NORTHCOM website where the Army and Marines, and Air Force, Security Forces, you name it, are all training to arrest American citizens.
[00:04:31.973 --> 00:04:41.560]  And the training manuals with law enforcement have sent us to the national news, say it's returning veterans, gun owners, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, anybody who basically understands what freedom is.
[00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:48.825]  This is like in a science fiction movie when the evil corporation takes over the government and orders the good guys arrested.
[00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.888]  But of course those movies are all based on real things that have happened in history.
[00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.591]  So truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:04:55.971 --> 00:04:57.793]  Fiction actually imitates life.
[00:04:58.153 --> 00:05:02.237]  The more I learn, I learn that I always thought that
[00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:06.129]  That life is imitating art.
[00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:06.870]  It's the other way around.
[00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.871]  Art is imitating life.
[00:05:08.632 --> 00:05:09.713]  And this is so incredible.
[00:05:09.973 --> 00:05:16.721]  This article goes over it all and it should not be up to a small independent media operation to be breaking all of this.
[00:05:17.202 --> 00:05:19.785]  The mainline corporate prostitute should be doing it.
[00:05:20.606 --> 00:05:30.031]  But later we've got a sociologist joining us who's broken down the actuaries that actually when the mainstream media endorses something, people run from it like the plague.
[00:05:30.432 --> 00:05:35.815]  We've got new news on the Ron Paul front with a sociologist and statistician joining us in studio.
[00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:37.756]  Again, jam-packed transmission, but...
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.421]  Exclusive.
[00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.743]  Government activating FEMA camps across the U.S.
[00:05:42.763 --> 00:05:43.664]  They're already built.
[00:05:44.244 --> 00:05:45.445]  They now admit they're there.
[00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:51.910]  Now they're going out and saying in all 50 states, they're going to have 300-person staging camps, 1,000-person staging camps.
[00:05:57.885 --> 00:06:02.713]  And again, you can go to Infowars.com and get the full report with the documents, the emails, all of it.
[00:06:03.134 --> 00:06:06.720]  Exclusive government activating FEMA camps across the United States.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.268]  Just a devastating, devastating investigative report up there right now.
[00:06:13.482 --> 00:06:15.625]  I don't even feel worthy to be bringing you this information.
[00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.307]  I hope it's not pearls before swine.
[00:06:18.028 --> 00:06:22.012]  We have the KBR instrumental in establishing the camps that are now to be activated in 2006.
[00:06:22.052 --> 00:06:28.660]  The internment camp service bid arrives after the National Defense Authorization Act.
[00:06:29.434 --> 00:06:36.135]  We have links in here where the government says it's terrorism to protest, and those documents have been leaked by good people in the government.
[00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:39.196]  I mean, this is so creepy, and it's so ridiculous.
[00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.637]  Obviously, protesting is not terrorism.
[00:06:41.977 --> 00:06:43.137]  Terrorists would say that.
[00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:51.659]  And of course, the state is always the greatest progenitor and deliverer and pusher of terror.
[00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:55.155]  As the founder said, it's the state you've got to worry about.
[00:06:55.736 --> 00:06:58.218]  Little people can do horrible things, but not on a mass scale.
[00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:04.103]  Governments bringing the atrocities we saw, 200 plus million killed by governments in the 20th century.
[00:07:04.884 --> 00:07:10.389]  And there's the original Wall Street Journal KBR awarded Homeland Security contract worth up to 385 mil.
[00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.394]  That was in 2006 to build some of these large camps.
[00:07:15.874 --> 00:07:18.056]  Now this is an activation
[00:07:19.058 --> 00:07:24.212]  uh... bid in all fifty states and uh... fema has ten regions but uh...
[00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:27.809]  KBR, you know, the corporations, they like to simplify things.
[00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:31.091]  They've broken it down into five regions.
[00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:34.173]  So, I don't know what you say about this.
[00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:35.794]  All of this is vetted.
[00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:37.175]  All of this is researched.
[00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:41.638]  And I remember Glenn Beck two years ago saying, I'm going to expose the FEMA camps.
[00:07:41.658 --> 00:07:42.178]  They're real.
[00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:49.483]  And then after a month of hype, he comes out and says it's all a fraud and uses known, discredited hoaxes on the Internet
[00:07:50.643 --> 00:08:06.813]  of railway stations and things, where the civilian inmate labor camp program has been declassified, the military with private prisoners in them to prime the pump and train the troops to be jail guards, the emergency centers establishment garbage, Rex 84, the congressional hearings in 86.
[00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:10.275]  I sent all this to Glenn Beck and I happen to know he got it.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:21.082]  And I happen to predict, I waited until the day before so people understood that it wasn't me predicting it and he just decided to do what I predicted, that he would go show fake straw men.
[00:08:22.182 --> 00:08:22.462]  Okay?
[00:08:23.522 --> 00:08:24.403]  And he did just that.
[00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:26.683]  I'm not here to attack Glenn Beck, okay?
[00:08:26.703 --> 00:08:30.544]  You know, he's done some good work and that's why he got too real and they got rid of him.
[00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:35.805]  The point is, is that we don't have time for people to be in
[00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:38.594]  Denial anymore.
[00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:41.039]  We don't have time to play games.
[00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:46.068]  I've given you the legislation, which didn't pass, but is the entire blueprint for what's already built.
[00:08:46.368 --> 00:08:51.037]  Kind of like they've been spying on us for decades, and then, when they got caught, they brought out legislation to legalize it.
[00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:55.418]  Or they get caught torturing them and try to pass laws to make it legal.
[00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:56.479]  Okay?
[00:08:56.499 --> 00:08:57.420]  That's what's going on here.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.722]  And it's pointed at the American people.
[00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:04.086]  I told you they'd have TSA on the streets running checkpoints.
[00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:05.688]  Now it's begun all over the country.
[00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:07.169]  I do my research.
[00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:08.050]  We do our research.
[00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.473]  And I'm getting chills right now for my family.
[00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:14.655]  I've decided to try to defend the Republic, and the globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[00:09:14.675 --> 00:09:17.256]  They've been exposed for their corruption, their drug dealing.
[00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:21.258]  It came out in the New York Times two days ago that the government is laundering drug money.
[00:09:21.498 --> 00:09:26.000]  The government itself, not just running guns into Mexico, that's been in federal court for years.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.882]  Again, these are criminals at the top, and it's time for people in the mid-level of government to say no to it.
[00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:39.245]  You know, Nixon gave orders that were illegal at the end, and people said, you know what, I'm not following your order to fire people that are investigating you.
[00:09:40.721 --> 00:09:42.623]  Just because you're the president doesn't make you king.
[00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:43.724]  This isn't the Third Reich.
[00:09:44.744 --> 00:09:47.086]  And it comes down to fundamental things.
[00:09:47.366 --> 00:09:50.249]  And we've really headed them off at the pass here.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:59.408]  We have from the beginning exposed these dastardly characters and so they don't know how to deal with it.
[00:09:59.869 --> 00:10:10.940]  They were supposed to just build up this whole COG, Continuity of Government Takeover system in the 80s with FEMA and then launch it by the 90s but people exposed it like Congressman
[00:10:12.622 --> 00:10:13.943]  From Texas, Jack Brooks.
[00:10:14.903 --> 00:10:17.385]  Also, Henry B. Gonzalez, Congressman from San Antonio.
[00:10:17.405 --> 00:10:18.425]  It was Texans fighting it.
[00:10:18.445 --> 00:10:20.667]  It's like it's Texans fighting it today.
[00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:22.628]  And we have a clip of that.
[00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:25.029]  This was all sent to Fox News and others.
[00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.970]  Who said they were going to expose it.
[00:10:27.291 --> 00:10:27.891]  Expose it?
[00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:31.553]  This is like seashells at the beach saying you can't find seashells.
[00:10:31.873 --> 00:10:33.394]  There's so much evidence here.
[00:10:33.774 --> 00:10:35.896]  It's like saying you can't find hair on a horse.
[00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:40.996]  I mean, there's so much evidence we can't even cover it all.
[00:10:41.276 --> 00:10:53.040]  Here's from my film out for over a year and a half, The Rise of FEMA, where we show the clip from Congress back in 86 with Jack Brooks, and then in the full film it goes to Henry B. Gonzalez exposing it.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.382]  Here it is.
[00:10:56.462 --> 00:11:00.343]  In the 1980s, the concentration camp program got a big boost.
[00:11:01.304 --> 00:11:03.645]  Colonel North, in your work at the NSC,
[00:11:05.643 --> 00:11:11.728]  Were you not assigned at one time to work on plans for the continuity of government in the event of a major disaster?
[00:11:12.308 --> 00:11:21.395]  Mr. Chairman... I believe that question touches upon a highly sensitive and classified area.
[00:11:22.255 --> 00:11:26.759]  So may I request that you not touch upon that, sir?
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.043]  I was particularly concerned, Mr. Chairman, because...
[00:11:33.544 --> 00:11:49.736]  I read in Miami Papers and several others that there had been a plan developed by that same agency, a contingency plan in the event of an emergency that would suspend the American Constitution.
[00:11:49.756 --> 00:11:54.300]  And I was deeply concerned about it, and wondering if that was the area in which he had worked.
[00:11:56.642 --> 00:12:02.226]  May I most respectfully request that that matter not be touched upon at this stage.
[00:12:03.183 --> 00:12:07.505]  We wish to get into this on certain arrangements can be made for an executive session.
[00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:14.589]  And tragically, the only member who got close was Jack Brooks, and he was stopped by the chairman.
[00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:30.397]  But the truth of the matter is that, yes, you do have those standby provisions, and the plans are there, and the statutory emergency plans are there, whereby you could, in the name of stopping terrorism, apprehend
[00:12:31.326 --> 00:12:38.150]  Invoke the military and arrest Americans and hold them in detention camp.
[00:12:39.831 --> 00:12:44.214]  Now the issue is they've been sneaking around doing this for decades, since the mid-eighties.
[00:12:44.994 --> 00:12:50.618]  The issue is they built these stinking things at old mothballed military bases, exactly as we said.
[00:12:50.998 --> 00:12:54.000]  That's in the Emergency Centers Establishment Act.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.182]  It confirms everything we already knew from our reverse engineering of it.
[00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:12.122]  The thing is, they're now putting the bids out in all 50 states to activate the small sub-camps, 300-person to 1,000-person camps, where they then interrogate you and stuff from our research and singe you off to the big camp.
[00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:14.327]  Three million people.
[00:13:14.907 --> 00:13:17.229]  They've got a camp for three million people.
[00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:19.770]  Three one million man camps that we know of.
[00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:21.412]  They built in 2006.
[00:13:21.792 --> 00:13:23.033]  I showed you Wall Street Journal.
[00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:25.094]  I can show you Houston Chronicle.
[00:13:25.374 --> 00:13:29.437]  And I mentioned that and the trolls and disinfo operatives run around and say we're making it up.
[00:13:29.957 --> 00:13:32.139]  So there's the information ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:32.519 --> 00:13:35.681]  I got to move quick now because we've got to continue with the other news.
[00:13:35.741 --> 00:13:37.302]  But this is so big.
[00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:42.626]  They're now activating the camps right as they pass the laws to use the military on us to secretly arrest us.
[00:13:43.426 --> 00:13:53.494]  And as they list protesters as terrorists, right as all of this is going on, it is so incredibly creepy.
[00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:55.736]  And then they always claim it's popular.
[00:13:55.816 --> 00:13:56.737]  Oh, it's for illegals.
[00:13:57.838 --> 00:14:02.421]  Folks, they just deport illegals in a very small number in show events.
[00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:06.344]  This is about the American people.
[00:14:07.372 --> 00:14:11.996]  That's what this is about, and they're looking at old jails and other facilities all over the country.
[00:14:12.016 --> 00:14:23.446]  When I went to Hardin, Montana, I snuck in when the tour guide wasn't looking for like 40 seconds, jumped into the main office, ran up and shot video, and it said, you know, civilian internment and all the rest of it.
[00:14:23.666 --> 00:14:26.068]  And I shot video and put it in the police state film.
[00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:33.812]  I mean, literally, while she's answering the phone, hold on one moment, I'm gonna answer the phone, I'm like, hmm, into the room, videotaping, I mean, and then popping back out.
[00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:37.214]  This is what we go through to bring you this information.
[00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:40.415]  And this criminal government is geared up to wage war against us.
[00:14:43.197 --> 00:14:44.177]  This is so incredible.
[00:14:44.777 --> 00:14:50.280]  I hope you get this information out to everybody in the headline, exclusive, government activating FEMA camps across the U.S.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.882]  They've denied they're there, now they admit they're there, now they're activating them.
[00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.391]  You understand the magnitude of this?
[00:14:59.332 --> 00:15:00.832]  They are now activating them.
[00:15:02.553 --> 00:15:12.259]  In fact, hit refresh on that, because I've asked Kurt to add the front graphic there of the five regions there, because that's what I want at the top.
[00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:14.300]  If not, give him a call, because that's what I want.
[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.121]  Yep, there it is.
[00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:15.361]  Good.
[00:15:16.321 --> 00:15:17.382]  He's got it all up.
[00:15:18.967 --> 00:15:26.451]  It's an incredibly detailed article that we spent a lot of time on today, and I hope that you get this out to everybody you know.
[00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:28.132]  All right, I've got to move on now.
[00:15:29.838 --> 00:15:30.839]  We've got to move on here.
[00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:34.821]  Again, right as they get ready to implode the economy, launch war with Iran.
[00:15:35.462 --> 00:15:38.364]  China is threatening to have war with us right as all this happens.
[00:15:38.924 --> 00:15:44.428]  And the head of the U.S.-Japanese Citizens Group says they're worried about what happened to them.
[00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:51.492]  People who'd lived here in some cases over a hundred years, business owners, had their property taken, never got it back, worked as slave labor.
[00:15:52.813 --> 00:15:59.338]  They didn't line them up and shoot them in the back of the head like the Nazis, but I'm sorry folks, I'm not going to some camp for four or five years, okay?
[00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.252]  The people that try this are criminals.
[00:16:03.073 --> 00:16:04.495]  And we've tried to warn you.
[00:16:05.216 --> 00:16:07.479]  So, people need to get ready for this.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.523]  We don't need to act like the Germans or the Russians and go along with this.
[00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:18.192]  We need to get the word out right now and use the information war and the power of the pen while we still can, peaceably.
[00:16:19.582 --> 00:16:19.962]  To avert
[00:16:37.674 --> 00:16:37.834]  Yes.
[00:16:55.373 --> 00:16:56.854]  The world is imploding.
[00:16:56.914 --> 00:17:00.477]  China was sold trillions in fake derivatives and fake mortgages.
[00:17:00.497 --> 00:17:01.178]  They're angry.
[00:17:02.018 --> 00:17:02.999]  This is just insane.
[00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:04.601]  Iran says prepare for attack.
[00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:05.501]  Now the U.S.
[00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:09.124]  and Israel admit they've been blowing stuff up in Iran, blowing up their bases.
[00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:14.949]  I mean, it is just getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.572]  And it's no doubt they're now putting the bid out.
[00:17:18.592 --> 00:17:23.196]  They're not going to man emergency camps all over the country to play patty cake.
[00:17:26.508 --> 00:17:28.231]  Oh, just off the charts insane.
[00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:31.216]  All right, shifting gears into the main players, the mega banks.
[00:17:31.716 --> 00:17:35.863]  They've put out public actuaries and reports that we've talked about for years.
[00:17:36.997 --> 00:17:44.987]  Where they've said they're going to first cut people's benefits and social security and similar government pensions around the world, and then they're going to go after private pensions.
[00:17:45.688 --> 00:17:53.837]  And they've already started this spin that, well, your private pension needs to be given as bailout to the mega banks that created the tens of trillions, well, actually 1,500 trillion in fake money.
[00:17:55.259 --> 00:18:04.005]  See, the ones that engineered this, they're always the ones lecturing us, and now you have the United States of Goldman Sachs, is what they're calling it in Europe, and bragging about it.
[00:18:04.665 --> 00:18:08.247]  And now, Portugal raids pension funds to meet deficit targets.
[00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:18.754]  Portugal has raided 5.6 billion euros, or 4.8 billion pounds, of pension fund assets in a controversial scramble to meet deficit targets.
[00:18:19.675 --> 00:18:22.617]  Which are set, the same thing they've done to third world countries, the IMF and World Bank,
[00:18:23.638 --> 00:18:25.480]  They're now doing it to Europe, and they're going to do it here.
[00:18:26.161 --> 00:18:27.602]  We're in worse shape than Europe.
[00:18:27.922 --> 00:18:29.304]  They're just bankrupting them first.
[00:18:29.324 --> 00:18:33.368]  And notice, every country they take over, that supposedly is going to fix it, and then spreads.
[00:18:33.408 --> 00:18:35.811]  We even told you what countries were coming next.
[00:18:36.772 --> 00:18:41.515]  Portugal said it informed EU and IMF and assured them that it would be a one-off.
[00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:43.376]  We're only taking part of your pension this one time.
[00:18:43.596 --> 00:18:51.320]  However, the 2010 budget was met by shipping three pension plans from Portugal Telecom onto the public social security system.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.741]  So, it's what they're going to do here.
[00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:54.602]  They raid your private money.
[00:18:54.642 --> 00:18:59.884]  This isn't calling social security welfare or devaluing your dollar and then saying, so what?
[00:19:00.245 --> 00:19:02.626]  This is taking your private money
[00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.869]  That under government mandates, they make you put in a private fund.
[00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:07.551]  That's why all these plans are bad.
[00:19:08.352 --> 00:19:12.557]  And then, the old-timers knew, don't keep your money in your mattress or in the backyard, buried.
[00:19:13.118 --> 00:19:20.206]  This is, they put it into government, who then takes part of it, as part of the custodial thing, on top of the giant taxes in Europe.
[00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:22.349]  I mean, Portugal's got taxes on average of about 65%.
[00:19:26.257 --> 00:19:27.458]  And the banks are all exempt.
[00:19:27.518 --> 00:19:29.919]  You read about the big mega banks are international.
[00:19:30.099 --> 00:19:31.880]  They write the laws where they pay zero tax.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.982]  And then they lobby all day to raise taxes on middle class, which they're just getting rid of.
[00:19:36.062 --> 00:19:37.643]  I mean, this is coming here.
[00:19:38.483 --> 00:19:39.223]  This is coming here.
[00:19:39.584 --> 00:19:43.686]  In fact, continuing with the news, anxious Greeks
[00:19:44.855 --> 00:19:45.935]  Emptying their bank accounts.
[00:19:46.055 --> 00:19:52.497]  And Der Spiegel, the big German publication, criticizes as, oh, you'll hurt the economy not trusting the banks and the government.
[00:19:52.837 --> 00:19:53.597]  What choice do they have?
[00:19:53.617 --> 00:19:58.438]  They're raising all these dozens of new taxes to pay off the trillions of dollars Greece doesn't owe.
[00:19:59.378 --> 00:20:13.721]  And the people are saying, well, if you're just going to grab my account now, now that Goldman Sachs openly controls all the banks and says they'll take whatever money they want, and they've got EU police going around literally shaking down businesses on new VAT taxes, the people are doing all they can.
[00:20:15.609 --> 00:20:16.730]  I mean, what are you supposed to do?
[00:20:17.932 --> 00:20:19.694]  Again, they always blame the victims.
[00:20:22.939 --> 00:20:25.120]  90 plus percent of Greece's debt not owed by the people.
[00:20:25.521 --> 00:20:28.802]  Their criminal government signed on to the globalist banker's debt.
[00:20:29.583 --> 00:20:30.363]  Iceland's the model.
[00:20:30.383 --> 00:20:32.244]  They're the one country for over a year to say no.
[00:20:32.564 --> 00:20:37.567]  They finally got the finance minister out and found out 90 plus percent of the debt was not theirs.
[00:20:38.147 --> 00:20:44.571]  It was all the mega banks lecturing them and saying they were going to shut down air travel and blockade the tiny country of 400,000 if they didn't
[00:20:47.725 --> 00:20:52.289]  Pay a couple hundred thousand dollars per individual in this bank bailout deal.
[00:20:52.309 --> 00:20:54.931]  I mean, sign on to be total debt slaves.
[00:20:55.692 --> 00:20:57.053]  Again, and you don't owe the money.
[00:20:57.113 --> 00:20:58.094]  I keep harping on this.
[00:20:59.095 --> 00:21:00.756]  There's an Economic Times report.
[00:21:00.776 --> 00:21:02.818]  I also saw it in AFP.
[00:21:03.579 --> 00:21:04.159]  Amazing.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.141]  Is the threat of homegrown U.S.
[00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:08.223]  terror suspects overblown?
[00:21:08.243 --> 00:21:13.127]  The numbers remain relatively small, said German, author of the book, Thinking Like a Terrorist.
[00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:14.868]  That's a former FBI agent.
[00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:19.190]  It's not a non-existent problem, but certainly not something new and growing.
[00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.211]  I want to get him on.
[00:21:20.251 --> 00:21:25.276]  He was also in that Ventura special, talking about the Threat Fusion Centers being a martial law takeover program.
[00:21:26.637 --> 00:21:27.398]  That's important.
[00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:29.880]  Continuing, Paul goes...
[00:21:31.906 --> 00:21:35.747]  On Newt attack, as yet another Iowa poll shows surging support.
[00:21:35.787 --> 00:21:38.148]  Ron Paul is clearly number two in Iowa now.
[00:21:38.208 --> 00:21:41.430]  The media is still trying to ignore him, but that's really an endorsement.
[00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:47.292]  And he's got new videos out exposing the incredible flip-flopping of Newt Gingrich, so that is...
[00:21:48.476 --> 00:22:02.065]  Paramount right now to expose Newt for all of his open borders, amnesty stuff, giant new taxes, doesn't like the family, wants world government, supports Obamacare, government mandate, single payer.
[00:22:03.504 --> 00:22:03.845]  Everything.
[00:22:05.186 --> 00:22:06.428]  Banker bailouts, everything.
[00:22:06.788 --> 00:22:07.710]  So very, very important.
[00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.213]  And another article on Gennrich by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:22:10.573 --> 00:22:16.541]  Newt Gennrich says, let mad scientists terraform the planet, or geoengineer it.
[00:22:16.861 --> 00:22:19.144]  Presidential frontrunner is geoengineering advocate.
[00:22:20.287 --> 00:22:28.651]  While saying this doesn't exist, he and the White House Science Czar and the CFR as well are endorsing the ongoing project to manipulate the weather.
[00:22:28.851 --> 00:22:34.834]  They admit it's going on, but say don't worry about it, don't ask questions, and NASA says the Earth is 22% darker than it was a decade ago.
[00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:45.160]  A presidential frontrunner goes on to say Republican presidential frontrunner Newt Gingrich, geoengineering is a product of the harebrained and potentially catastrophic scientific fringe that postates that
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:54.991]  Using airliners to dump huge amounts of sulfur into the atmosphere, injecting the oceans with nitrogen, and parking giant spaceships above the earth to block out the sun as necessary to avert global warming.
[00:22:55.011 --> 00:22:56.974]  It's really about them playing God.
[00:22:57.514 --> 00:23:04.122]  Now we're going to go to break and come back with anthropologist, sociologist, statistician,
[00:23:05.003 --> 00:23:13.915]  We're going to be talking with Patrick Dew on the other side of this break and ask the question, are the media purposely ignoring Ron Paul?
[00:23:14.456 --> 00:23:18.721]  And he's done his own breakdown with public numbers and found what other scientific researchers have.
[00:23:19.002 --> 00:23:20.323]  He's got some shocking findings.
[00:23:20.684 --> 00:23:21.204]  Stay with us.
[00:23:21.325 --> 00:23:22.046]  We'll be back.

[00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:55.456]  In every order.

[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.901]  It's all there.
[00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:03.182]  InfoWars.com.
[00:24:10.117 --> 00:24:10.998]  And we are back.
[00:24:11.718 --> 00:24:22.625]  It is the second segment of InfoWars Nightly News here every evening, seven o'clock central, streaming out at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:24:23.285 --> 00:24:39.056]  I say that because if you're watching this on YouTube or one of the thousands of other video sites where we have millions of viewers every week, I'd like you to remember that there are moves for internet kill switches, selective enforcement against alternative media, and a whole constellation
[00:24:39.676 --> 00:24:40.056]  I don't know.
[00:24:59.378 --> 00:25:06.523]  The FEMA camps that they admittedly have been building since the 1980s and accelerated the construction of after the staged events of 9-11.
[00:25:06.823 --> 00:25:12.246]  This is incredible information, but being aware of it and speaking out against it can't stop it.
[00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:23.414]  This, of course, all on the heels of the draconian National Defense Authorization Act and the announcement that they'll use the military on the streets of America against the American people in definite detention.
[00:25:24.414 --> 00:25:25.675]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:35.023]  It's come out in several big studies, scientific studies, Pew Research and others, what our lion eyes have already told us.
[00:25:35.444 --> 00:25:38.727]  Ron Paul gets 89 seconds in a presidential CBS debate.
[00:25:39.267 --> 00:25:40.849]  The next candidate gets two and a half minutes.
[00:25:41.069 --> 00:25:42.430]  Others got more than 10 minutes.
[00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:47.274]  That's what is censoring and basically banning from the event.
[00:25:47.995 --> 00:25:53.258]  Without actually doing it, because then he would get some attention being totally blacked out and blacklisted.
[00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:57.561]  Or, you know, a form of McCarthy-type censorship.
[00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:03.344]  And, of course, we've seen the examples of what coverage he does get is incredibly negative.
[00:26:03.504 --> 00:26:15.291]  But our very own director of Infoworks, finally knows, Rob Due's brother is a statistical analysis sociologist and researcher at Texas State University.
[00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:16.312]  He's also working there on his
[00:26:17.012 --> 00:26:21.653]  He's with us because he's taken the numbers in the big Pew Research piece and crunched
[00:26:33.197 --> 00:26:37.141]  Crunched it himself and come up with some other interesting information.
[00:26:37.501 --> 00:26:40.204]  Now, he finished this a few months ago.
[00:26:40.704 --> 00:26:43.787]  Since then, the numbers have even gotten stronger.
[00:26:44.468 --> 00:26:51.194]  But Patrick New joins us today to break this down as a statistician and sociologist.
[00:26:51.474 --> 00:26:52.635]  Amazing findings!
[00:26:52.655 --> 00:26:58.181]  We're going to put some of these on screen, but break down what the original study did and then what you gleaned from the numbers they had.
[00:26:58.661 --> 00:27:07.671]  Well, Tricia Sartor wrote a report for the Pew Research Institute on excellence in journalism, outlining the number of news articles that the candidates received.
[00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:12.035]  And some people weren't candidates at all, but for sake of time, Mitt Romney received 120.
[00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:17.004]  Articles where he was the lead news maker of that article.
[00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:19.566]  In comparison, Ron Paul received 27.
[00:27:20.507 --> 00:27:27.454]  To keep this number in order, the same newspapers produced stories about Barack Obama.
[00:27:27.494 --> 00:27:34.260]  President Obama, he received over 220 articles about, over the same information.
[00:27:34.941 --> 00:27:45.910]  So, what I did was I took this information, I used it as an independent variable to see if this would determine how straw poll results would turn out or how candidates received coverage during debates.
[00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:51.875]  So I took five debates in September and October and broke them down, how many times each candidate was allowed to speak.
[00:27:52.395 --> 00:27:52.575]  I think?
[00:28:07.592 --> 00:28:15.996]  What's fascinating is that there's an inverse relationship between the number of news articles written about the candidates and the number of straw poll victories.
[00:28:16.616 --> 00:28:22.359]  As of October 29th, Ron Paul had won 11 straw polls and Mitt Romney had won 4.
[00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:27.321]  Newt Gingrich hadn't won one, and Herman Cain had won 12.
[00:28:28.021 --> 00:28:30.062]  Since that time, there's been nine more straw polls.
[00:28:30.262 --> 00:28:31.583]  Ron Paul's won six of them.
[00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:36.325]  Herman Cain won two, and Newt Gingrich won one, making him now the new frontrunner.
[00:28:36.405 --> 00:28:38.286]  So Ron Paul is the undisputed leader?
[00:28:38.346 --> 00:28:39.106]  The undisputed leader.
[00:28:39.146 --> 00:28:41.307]  He's got 17 victories out of the 44.
[00:28:41.427 --> 00:28:47.030]  That's 38% of the victories of the straw polls, and yet he's getting no coverage until recently.
[00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:54.136]  Now, you're the analyst and the sociologist and the statistician, but correct me if I'm wrong, what this is showing is there's two different worlds.
[00:28:54.176 --> 00:29:03.283]  There's the mainstream media saying who they think the winner is, and the crowd that follows what the mainstream media says, and then there's the other crowd that's becoming larger every day.
[00:29:03.763 --> 00:29:08.229]  That doesn't go off what the so-called dinosaur media says, who was supporting Ron Paul.
[00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:18.803]  And I saw this in Kentucky, when the media was attacking Rand Paul, the more they attacked him and claimed he was worshipping Buddhas and kidnapping women and wasn't a medical doctor, all of which was lies.
[00:29:19.864 --> 00:29:22.846]  His numbers only went up, and that's what I told Politico last year.
[00:29:22.886 --> 00:29:25.948]  I said, if you want to destroy Rand Paul, endorse him.
[00:29:26.068 --> 00:29:28.090]  The system just doesn't get its discredited.
[00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:32.152]  Now that's what I see as somebody who hasn't scientifically broken down the numbers.
[00:29:32.513 --> 00:29:33.794]  What do you get from this?
[00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:44.029]  This seems like they have had someone that they want to be the leader from, I mean, Mitt Romney, according to Gallup Polls, has been the leader since November 2010.
[00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:53.620]  So, even though he's not, this isn't shown, I mean, straw polls aren't scientific, but they're supposed to be, they're given an idea of what people are thinking, how they would vote.
[00:29:54.281 --> 00:30:03.097]  Again, people could change their votes, but I don't see why people who would go to these straw polls, and usually they're donating money, would put a false vote down.
[00:30:03.117 --> 00:30:05.361]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous that...
[00:30:06.417 --> 00:30:18.063]  I mean, I think it all starts from his 1988 campaign when he ran for president, and then it started this grassroots movement that got him support in 2008, which has just exploded now in 2011 and going into the 2000s.
[00:30:18.104 --> 00:30:19.284]  So it's worlds colliding.
[00:30:19.324 --> 00:30:27.949]  It's real grassroots populism, left, right, across the board, versus the establishment serving up the Obama and Newt Gingrich type candidates.
[00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:29.650]  Absolutely, because he's never had this amount of support.
[00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.471]  Ron Paul has never had this amount of support before, this amount of coverage.
[00:30:32.491 --> 00:30:41.956]  I mean, in 2008 it was, 2007 even, when the Tea Party first originated, you know, being built back up again, and it was all support of Ron Paul, and then it was absorbed by Fox News.
[00:30:42.617 --> 00:30:46.379]  And they're just, they're going to try to take his ideas, is what I'm guessing.
[00:30:46.439 --> 00:30:47.779]  I mean, that's what Rick Perry's done.
[00:30:47.819 --> 00:30:54.643]  He's tried to take Ron Paul's ideas and use them as his own, and try to finagle his way into the race.
[00:30:54.683 --> 00:30:55.964]  But, I mean, he's not...
[00:30:56.724 --> 00:30:58.205]  Well, people discovered he was a fraud.
[00:30:58.285 --> 00:30:58.565]  Right.
[00:30:58.785 --> 00:31:02.947]  I mean, the fact is Ron Paul is who he says he is, and people trying to become Ron Paul are failing.
[00:31:03.227 --> 00:31:04.088]  It's like shark teeth.
[00:31:04.128 --> 00:31:21.176]  You get one candidate, people find out about him, they fall back, another comes forward, and they've said it's whoever comes up last when the primary hits, like a Newt Gingrich, who isn't found out before the primaries that they believe will get it, and that's why they're in a race to beat Paul, but now even CBS has to admit he is in second place now, behind
[00:31:22.444 --> 00:31:34.234]  Uh, Newt Gingrich, but they've now made him the heir apparent, but just amazing that he's now won six more straw polls, so he's the undisputed winner of those, and is now coming up third and second place in all the other scientific polls.
[00:31:35.635 --> 00:31:39.818]  So, so, so we gave this interview a headline from the Pew Research.
[00:31:39.878 --> 00:31:45.482]  I guess it's just, scientific study shows media endorsement, uh,
[00:31:47.797 --> 00:31:52.701]  I mean, what's the bottom line statement you got from this?
[00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:56.524]  Well, I mean, the media, they have something to sell.
[00:31:56.604 --> 00:32:04.070]  They're selling to an audience and they're telling people what they want them to do, how they want them to vote, but people who are paying attention aren't buying into it.
[00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:06.772]  So if we can keep that momentum going, you know, I mean, he's winning
[00:32:07.852 --> 00:32:09.034]  Yeah, 38% of the straw polls.
[00:32:09.054 --> 00:32:10.175]  I mean, there's a reason for that.
[00:32:10.195 --> 00:32:13.558]  It's not just a fluke, you know, but they can disregard it as much as they want.
[00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:16.100]  Yeah, out of eight candidates, he's winning the most.
[00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:22.026]  So what you're really saying from this breakdown is that the public is not buying
[00:32:23.598 --> 00:32:29.045]  The media is losing its endorsement power.
[00:32:29.285 --> 00:32:29.665]  They are.
[00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:41.500]  You still have special interest groups and you have the religious group, not fundamentalists, but you have religious organizations that will vote a certain way and they have their pastors tell people how to vote.
[00:32:42.601 --> 00:32:43.562]  It's spreading.
[00:32:43.642 --> 00:32:46.484]  It's spreading slowly and it takes time but I mean it's happening.
[00:32:48.185 --> 00:32:55.590]  It's an anomaly because there's no reason why someone who receives that much media support should be winning this number of polls.
[00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.331]  That's right.
[00:32:56.451 --> 00:33:02.656]  He's getting the least amount of coverage and he's winning the most and I think what that really shows
[00:33:03.396 --> 00:33:07.199]  It shows a lot of things, is that the mainstream media is not as powerful as it was.
[00:33:07.579 --> 00:33:18.809]  TV viewership's down, newspaper reading is down, more people get their news from the web, the alternative media, and we've crossed the Rubicon the last two years, a lot of studies show this, that alternative media is now the dominant media.
[00:33:19.329 --> 00:33:28.597]  It's just truly diverse and a million different voices, whereas you've got the old media, a hundred different voices, but they are now the smaller part of the market share.
[00:33:28.817 --> 00:33:31.399]  So they can still steer things for a little while.
[00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:36.703]  They can con people in the short term, but their staying power isn't there.
[00:33:36.924 --> 00:33:37.804]  They're out of bullets.
[00:33:38.745 --> 00:33:39.125]  It's over.
[00:33:39.165 --> 00:33:40.226]  The dinosaurs are dying.
[00:33:40.727 --> 00:33:41.127]  I agree.
[00:33:41.147 --> 00:33:41.687]  I agree.
[00:33:45.743 --> 00:33:47.603]  Ron Paul has an opportunity now.
[00:33:47.663 --> 00:33:54.625]  If the Iowa caucus can say anything, if it has a lot of support, then maybe we are making a change.
[00:33:55.665 --> 00:33:57.545]  There can be hope and change in the world again.
[00:33:58.305 --> 00:34:08.487]  But if we can turn that corner and he can win the Republican vote, his problem is that he's not a conventional Republican candidate because he's got too many socially liberal views.
[00:34:08.968 --> 00:34:10.468]  He's not trying to get involved too much.
[00:34:11.388 --> 00:34:15.617]  And he wants to take our military out of foreign land.
[00:34:15.897 --> 00:34:17.521]  He's a constitutionalist.
[00:34:17.881 --> 00:34:20.106]  Which means he's a classical liberal like Thomas Jefferson.
[00:34:22.483 --> 00:34:26.827]  The people that say that they're liberals now are more conservative because they're not going for change.
[00:34:26.847 --> 00:34:33.292]  They're trying to keep everything the same, keep the status quo, keep their pockets full, and he's the only person who's talking about realities.
[00:34:33.312 --> 00:34:34.693]  He's not going for applause points.
[00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:38.176]  He's not going for... Yeah, I know the behind-the-scenes baseball.
[00:34:38.216 --> 00:34:40.358]  He doesn't even want power to be the president.
[00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:41.619]  He knows it's a responsibility.
[00:34:41.959 --> 00:34:48.804]  You know, the exciting thing about this though is, as you pointed out, he got a fraction of the media coverage four years ago that he's getting now
[00:34:50.105 --> 00:34:52.907]  Uh, and it shows the grassroots is what's put him here.
[00:34:53.187 --> 00:34:56.769]  Now he's getting a little more media attention, but still compared to the others, it's the lowest level.
[00:34:57.009 --> 00:35:04.553]  It really shows that the grassroots has grown, and even if he doesn't win, the ideas that he's been a focal point of are growing exponentially.
[00:35:04.753 --> 00:35:05.894]  I think that's his goal, too.
[00:35:05.914 --> 00:35:07.835]  I don't think he cares to win.
[00:35:07.875 --> 00:35:09.496]  I think he's trying to wake people up.
[00:35:09.596 --> 00:35:18.262]  And now it's working, because 10 years ago I was in a band, and now I'm writing papers like this, and I guess being an activist, and trying to get people to pay attention.
[00:35:18.282 --> 00:35:20.703]  Well, that's what the Bilderberg Group said two years ago.
[00:35:21.424 --> 00:35:23.305]  We have inside sources there through Jim Tucker.
[00:35:23.325 --> 00:35:24.546]  They said they're very upset.
[00:35:24.566 --> 00:35:28.548]  I mean, of the actual 130 most powerful people in the world, they're talking about Ron Paul.
[00:35:29.049 --> 00:35:32.291]  And they said it's not that they know they can probably keep him out with election fraud.
[00:35:32.771 --> 00:35:37.172]  It's that on the colleges it's not communism that the kids think or young people think is cool.
[00:35:37.472 --> 00:35:39.793]  It's not right-wing fascist type fake stuff.
[00:35:40.173 --> 00:35:41.573]  It's true libertarian ideas.
[00:35:41.633 --> 00:35:46.494]  They know their gauges show that's the hottest thing and they see that growth rate and they're panicking.
[00:35:46.874 --> 00:35:51.235]  I want to give you four or five minutes Patrick without my interjections to go over your report.
[00:35:51.656 --> 00:35:56.837]  I want to give you the floor to really take your time and break down the different facets of this.
[00:35:56.937 --> 00:36:01.018]  I want to get your report that's boiled down
[00:36:01.778 --> 00:36:08.380]  The reason why I did this report was because I was tired of arguing and campaigning for Ron Paul and telling people that the media was ignoring him and them not believing me because they want to
[00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:50.156]  They use the excuse that the media, they weed through people running for office candidates in order to find the best possible one and they'll focus on that one, but they're not doing their job now and so I wanted to point out why and do it scientifically rather than taking a partisan stance and saying why I'm a supporter of Ron Paul and here's why I like him.
[00:36:52.598 --> 00:36:53.560]  He's got three problems.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:37:01.071]  He's seen as a third party candidate, as a libertarian, so he's not a conventional Republican candidate, and he's not a conventional Democratic candidate either.
[00:37:01.672 --> 00:37:01.912]  Big D.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.805]  His stance on foreign policy is different than any other Republican candidate.
[00:37:08.085 --> 00:37:15.815]  He wants to bring our military home instead of falling in line with the same American exceptionalism and the rest of the world should get in line and follow suit.
[00:37:16.716 --> 00:37:20.540]  And his stance on social issues are another reason why he's so different.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.343]  He's pro-gay rights.
[00:37:22.383 --> 00:37:22.763]  He's not
[00:37:23.744 --> 00:37:31.470]  He's not a supporter of abortion, but he's not the type of individual who wants to tell people how they should live their lives.
[00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:35.974]  So I respect him in that sense, is that he's not trying to dictate people's lives.
[00:37:35.994 --> 00:37:37.635]  So he's an important individual.
[00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:44.100]  And when I came across the Pew Research Report by Tricia Sartor, I thought it was amazing that he was getting so little coverage.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.943]  Because at that time, when I first found that, he had still won seven straw polls.
[00:37:47.963 --> 00:37:49.524]  So he had still had some success.
[00:37:50.425 --> 00:38:02.109]  So, I took five debates from September and October and I broke those down and I looked at the number of times each candidate spoke and the number of, and the minutes that each candidate spoke.
[00:38:03.409 --> 00:38:09.131]  Individuals like Mitt Romney and Rick Perry received over an hour of talking time for those five debates.
[00:38:09.231 --> 00:38:10.892]  Ron Paul received 37 minutes.
[00:38:12.092 --> 00:38:15.233]  He was allowed to talk, I'm sorry, 36 minutes.
[00:38:15.253 --> 00:38:16.994]  He was allowed to talk 37 times.
[00:38:17.074 --> 00:38:18.715]  The other candidates spoke over 60 times.
[00:38:20.055 --> 00:38:22.616]  The next closest one was Herman Cain who spoke 44.
[00:38:24.676 --> 00:38:31.458]  He's just not receiving the fair amount that I would think an individual like him because he's a straight up individual.
[00:38:31.498 --> 00:38:37.520]  He's not using tactics to break down his candidates.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.601]  He's being the type of person I think we should all emulate and try to be like.
[00:38:41.801 --> 00:38:45.482]  And so, looking at the straw poll results, all of them have been
[00:38:48.519 --> 00:38:59.243]  Uh, referenced, and so, through 35 of Mitt Romney has won 4, Rick Perry won 1, Michelle Bachman won, Rick Santorum 2, Ron Paul 11, Herman Cain 12.
[00:39:00.364 --> 00:39:13.429]  Uh, now Herman Cain's not in the race anymore, so, and since then, since 9 more straw polls have happened, and like I said, Ron Paul's won 6, Herman Cain won 2, but he dropped out right after the second one, and Newt Gingrich has won 1.
[00:39:13.729 --> 00:39:15.970]  So we have an individual who's won 17 straw polls,
[00:39:16.889 --> 00:39:22.495]  From over the last 11 plus months that is not receiving any media attention.
[00:39:22.556 --> 00:39:29.203]  So, but I didn't want to say it was a sociological phenomenon known as the hostile media effect because that's all about perception.
[00:39:29.544 --> 00:39:33.248]  And that's where you get tied up is where you start saying there's media bias out there.
[00:39:33.648 --> 00:39:35.210]  Then you have to prove that there's a bias.
[00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:37.332]  And the problem with bias is that it's all about perception.
[00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:50.527]  It's an individual who's a Fox News watcher will say that MSNBC has a liberal bias because they don't have the same viewpoint as someone who's reporting Fox's stance or ideology.
[00:39:52.329 --> 00:39:53.531]  This is cold hard facts!
[00:39:54.795 --> 00:39:55.055]  Yes.
[00:39:55.295 --> 00:39:56.496]  And this isn't about bias.
[00:39:56.716 --> 00:39:57.856]  It clearly shows a bias.
[00:39:58.176 --> 00:40:00.057]  It shows they're scared of Ron Paul.
[00:40:01.057 --> 00:40:03.698]  And since you did this report a few months ago, now they're cutting him even more.
[00:40:04.038 --> 00:40:06.358]  Forget he gets 2 or 3 minutes and Rick Perry gets 10.
[00:40:06.819 --> 00:40:11.220]  Now we're talking about 89 seconds in the televised part of the CBS debate.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.120]  And not even giving him a closing statement.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.521]  You know, just blocking him out.
[00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:15.561]  And they're afraid.
[00:40:15.661 --> 00:40:17.942]  And this is, I mean, they're grasping at straws.
[00:40:17.962 --> 00:40:19.322]  They're trying to stop what's happening.
[00:40:19.342 --> 00:40:21.463]  Well, now he's being outright blocked from some debates.
[00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:27.210]  And they're also making it more of a circus bringing in the establishment ringer Donald Trump.
[00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.011]  Right, to back our boy Newt.
[00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:32.971]  In closing, what are some of these other numbers?
[00:40:33.571 --> 00:40:41.353]  Well, I did a correlation and regression analysis, and the purpose of that is to see the relationship or association that exists between two variables.
[00:40:41.554 --> 00:40:50.776]  I used the Pew Research Report as my independent variable to see if it affected the outcomes of the straw polls or the amount of coverage individuals would receive in debate.
[00:40:50.836 --> 00:40:54.357]  So the debate coverage and the straw polls are my dependent variables.
[00:40:55.697 --> 00:41:10.984]  I found that there's a very weak relationship between the news articles written and the amount of time each candidate had to speak at the debates, but I found a relatively moderate association between
[00:41:12.725 --> 00:41:18.609]  Number of news articles written between January 1st of 2011 through August 14th and the number of straw poll victories.
[00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:21.070]  But this is the inverse relationship that exists.
[00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:27.374]  So it produces an R score or a correlation of negative .482 and that's out of one.
[00:41:27.394 --> 00:41:30.856]  So a one would be, or a negative one would be a perfect correlation.
[00:41:30.916 --> 00:41:36.419]  So we're about at 50% of a, and that's a very small data set.
[00:41:36.459 --> 00:41:40.722]  I mean this is one election over just over eight months.
[00:41:40.762 --> 00:41:42.503]  So quantify that for a lay person.
[00:41:43.283 --> 00:41:54.346]  What it's saying is that as the number of news articles increase, the number of straw poll victories goes down by 0.5, essentially.
[00:41:54.406 --> 00:41:56.947]  So it's not just that people are ignoring the media.
[00:41:57.187 --> 00:41:59.348]  When the media endorses you, people don't trust you.
[00:41:59.508 --> 00:41:59.848]  Correct.
[00:42:00.748 --> 00:42:03.929]  That's what I've already seen in my own observation.
[00:42:05.319 --> 00:42:20.703]  So, I mean, it just goes down to it, and the only thing I can think of is that the establishment, they have a set that this is our conservative candidate, he's going to have this set of views, and Ron Paul doesn't fit into that, so we're going to do whatever we can to keep him out, because he doesn't fall in line with our plan.
[00:42:21.163 --> 00:42:21.383]  Yeah.
[00:42:21.944 --> 00:42:22.544]  Or endgame.
[00:42:22.924 --> 00:42:23.064]  Wow.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.661]  Well, I mean, is this published publicly yet?
[00:42:27.681 --> 00:42:29.483]  Because I can't wait to get it out at InfoWars.
[00:42:29.903 --> 00:42:31.704]  It's on your site as of yesterday.
[00:42:31.724 --> 00:42:32.425]  Oh, good.
[00:42:33.205 --> 00:42:35.547]  So whose article, there's so many articles I can't read them all.
[00:42:36.668 --> 00:42:37.468]  What was it posted in?
[00:42:37.488 --> 00:42:39.089]  Like in articles we put it on screen for folks?
[00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:46.695]  I believe it was on your homepage under local media, I guess, or, not independent, but
[00:42:48.049 --> 00:42:48.850]  I can't think of the name.
[00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:49.890]  This is big news.
[00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.812]  We seem to hide things that are huge.
[00:42:52.212 --> 00:42:56.855]  But we'll find out, and I'll definitely get a bigger article on this tomorrow.
[00:42:56.895 --> 00:43:01.718]  Another scientific study shows media ignoring Ron Paul.
[00:43:02.238 --> 00:43:05.641]  But then, more importantly, a new scientific study
[00:43:06.952 --> 00:43:08.433]  It basically validates what we already know.
[00:43:08.474 --> 00:43:10.796]  When the mainstream media endorses you, you fall like a rock.
[00:43:10.956 --> 00:43:12.157]  And that's all it's trying to do is validate.
[00:43:12.197 --> 00:43:13.999]  So the only other thing they've got is just to block you out.
[00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:14.739]  I'm sorry.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:19.704]  I mean, that's the reason why I did it is because, I mean, everybody has their opinion and we all know that he's being blocked out.
[00:43:19.724 --> 00:43:25.870]  But now we can say, well, scientific, you know, analysis tells us that he's being blocked and people just aren't buying into it.
[00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.151]  But there's a point there, though, because it can get confused.
[00:43:29.171 --> 00:43:30.032]  I mean, even I'm doing it.
[00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:33.953]  There's two things happening, or even more, but two main things.
[00:43:33.973 --> 00:43:44.098]  A, they're cheating him on the time, because that is an effective way to try to hold him down, so new people don't discover him in the controlled old dinosaur media paradigm.
[00:43:45.138 --> 00:44:00.190]  But then it expands from there, from that point, because it's not just that the media is ignoring him and that is effective, it's that for people that are reading that media, they're not covering
[00:44:01.425 --> 00:44:03.667]  Him doesn't matter because people, they endorse it hurts them.
[00:44:03.907 --> 00:44:04.107]  Right.
[00:44:04.127 --> 00:44:07.510]  I mean, I said that in a long-winded way, but wow, just incredible information.
[00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.572]  All right, well, Patrick, dude, thanks a lot for coming in.
[00:44:10.592 --> 00:44:15.876]  Great job, and it's great working with your brother, Rob, and I appreciate the work you're doing.
[00:44:15.936 --> 00:44:23.001]  I hope that more statisticians and more sociologists do what Pew's done, do what you've done, and just continue to show this.
[00:44:23.481 --> 00:44:27.224]  Because I remember a few months ago, they said, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, Ron Paul's being cheated.
[00:44:27.504 --> 00:44:29.846]  And then Pew came out and other studies, and now you've done it.
[00:44:29.906 --> 00:44:32.949]  Everybody forgets that they made that statement, that it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.990]  Exactly.
[00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:39.035]  This shows that the so-called mainstream media is like lead weights on somebody.
[00:44:39.075 --> 00:44:42.158]  I mean, this really shows it's not only that their power's diminished...
[00:44:43.095 --> 00:44:53.567]  It's that unless they want to start endorsing good people, it's a really sophisticated PSYOP, and then that would really confuse people, but that's the only curveball they haven't thrown yet.
[00:44:53.607 --> 00:44:54.268]  You see what I'm saying?
[00:44:54.308 --> 00:44:59.093]  I guess we see if the Tea Party then backs Ron Paul, maybe we'll have a, you know, maybe we'll see him diminish in power.
[00:44:59.153 --> 00:44:59.674]  Exactly!
[00:44:59.694 --> 00:45:03.659]  I think if Fox News started endorsing Ron Paul, he might actually...
[00:45:04.119 --> 00:45:05.720]  They're outsmarting themselves, right?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.382]  Yeah, yeah, but they know that's a dangerous game.
[00:45:08.622 --> 00:45:09.422]  Alright, great having you in.
[00:45:09.602 --> 00:45:10.003]  Thank you, sir.
[00:45:10.323 --> 00:45:10.803]  Thanks a lot.
[00:45:11.223 --> 00:45:14.786]  Alright, folks, we're going to come back and obviously we'll have a bigger article out on this tomorrow.
[00:45:14.806 --> 00:45:15.946]  This is big breaking news.
[00:45:17.487 --> 00:45:18.168]  So many angles.
[00:45:18.588 --> 00:45:21.189]  We're going to come back and get into the second half of the news.
[00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.350]  So much news tonight.
[00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:24.531]  We've got to do this in two different parts.
[00:45:24.852 --> 00:45:26.573]  And then we're going to end the transmission.
[00:45:27.393 --> 00:45:36.457]  With a film review of the 1973 Clockwork Orange by Stanley Kubrick and the parallels to what's happening in our society.
[00:45:36.837 --> 00:45:49.263]  And then we'll also break down the whole Corbett Report that engaged in a psy-op against this show, the InfoWars Nightly News, myself and Jesse Ventura, dealing with the Denver International Airport.
[00:45:49.603 --> 00:45:51.524]  So that's coming up after the news.
[00:45:51.804 --> 00:45:53.045]  Final segment straight ahead.
[00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:58.287]  What's up with these sorry politicians?
[00:45:58.548 --> 00:46:02.210]  Lots of bark, but when it's showtime, whimpering like little shih tzus.
[00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:03.651]  You want big cuts?
[00:46:03.931 --> 00:46:05.872]  Ron Paul's been screaming it for years.
[00:46:06.233 --> 00:46:06.953]  Budget crisis?
[00:46:07.193 --> 00:46:07.894]  No problem.
[00:46:08.094 --> 00:46:09.615]  Got a trillion bucks year one.
[00:46:09.835 --> 00:46:12.857]  That's trillion with a T. Department of Education?
[00:46:13.097 --> 00:46:13.498]  Gone.
[00:46:13.778 --> 00:46:14.318]  Interior?
[00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:14.898]  Energy?
[00:46:15.019 --> 00:46:15.339]  HUD?
[00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:15.939]  Commerce?
[00:46:16.159 --> 00:46:16.540]  Gone.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.141]  Later bureaucrats.
[00:46:18.421 --> 00:46:20.282]  That's how Ron Paul rolls.
[00:46:20.682 --> 00:46:21.943]  Want to drain the swamp?
[00:46:22.103 --> 00:46:22.804]  Ron Paul.
[00:46:23.184 --> 00:46:23.564]  Do it.
[00:46:23.965 --> 00:46:25.906]  I'm Ron Paul and I approve this message.

[00:47:02.295 --> 00:47:02.975]  It's all there.
[00:47:03.396 --> 00:47:04.276]  InfoWars.com.
[00:47:11.172 --> 00:47:17.177]  Welcome back, it is the final segment of InfoWars Nightly News on this Tuesday, December 6th transmission.
[00:47:17.497 --> 00:47:30.007]  Please go to InfoWars.com, please, and email everybody you know, Facebook, Twitter, this article about the federal government, the government activating the FEMA camps.
[00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:35.110]  Now they're moving to put the jail guards, the personnel, the barricades
[00:47:35.951 --> 00:47:38.872]  Out on the roads, the final system.
[00:47:39.712 --> 00:47:43.333]  And they're admitting that they're preparing for domestic unrest and all of this.
[00:47:43.913 --> 00:47:45.494]  This is internal information.
[00:47:46.094 --> 00:47:52.575]  It's extremely important that you understand that these are only sub-camps for delivery to the one million man camps.
[00:47:53.576 --> 00:47:55.216]  Just unbelievable information.
[00:47:55.236 --> 00:47:56.256]  Please get that out to everyone.
[00:47:56.576 --> 00:47:58.357]  Okay, let's race now through the news.
[00:48:01.121 --> 00:48:08.305]  I learned in 1996 from a nurse in San Antonio at one of the three facilities in the U.S.
[00:48:08.325 --> 00:48:09.526]  that holds these blood samples.
[00:48:09.806 --> 00:48:11.087]  And I was sent secret documents.
[00:48:12.187 --> 00:48:13.668]  I showed them on local access TV.
[00:48:13.728 --> 00:48:15.129]  I talked about them on the radio.
[00:48:15.529 --> 00:48:16.710]  I actually got death threats over it.
[00:48:18.062 --> 00:48:20.263]  And no one believed me, so it was never an issue.
[00:48:20.623 --> 00:48:27.405]  That everybody at birth in the Western world, for now 40 years, it's right at 40 years, has their blood taken and put in a database.
[00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:42.010]  And now in court cases, it's come out in the last three years, because now the corporations say, we got your blood samples, we patented it, and when you go to get a breast cancer system that's genetically based, we've patented that.
[00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:43.951]  They're even now patenting individuals.
[00:48:45.094 --> 00:48:46.714]  And it's just a brazen criminality.
[00:48:46.734 --> 00:48:48.895]  It's kind of like Monsanto infects your field.
[00:48:49.295 --> 00:48:50.755]  Clearly, it's them infecting you.
[00:48:50.775 --> 00:48:53.316]  Because it's not their variety 100%.
[00:48:53.956 --> 00:48:59.157]  It's 1 or 2% of your variety that you have a record you bought seeds for infected by them.
[00:48:59.177 --> 00:49:01.937]  Because, you know, plants aren't like you have one dad and one mom.
[00:49:01.977 --> 00:49:03.018]  It could be in some varieties.
[00:49:03.318 --> 00:49:04.438]  Hundreds of different plants.
[00:49:04.558 --> 00:49:05.358]  Pollen goes in.
[00:49:05.378 --> 00:49:07.999]  But I'm getting too technical.
[00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.019]  The point is,
[00:49:10.191 --> 00:49:15.336]  That all over the world they're announcing that they're going to just release everybody's medical records.
[00:49:15.956 --> 00:49:23.543]  Governments in the Western world, it's all standardized under the New World Order, the eugenics system, in the last decade have been collating all your medical records.
[00:49:24.284 --> 00:49:26.065]  What prescriptions you get, everything.
[00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:27.787]  What dentist you visit, what was done.
[00:49:28.147 --> 00:49:31.210]  That's all indentured servitude, but they've got to upload it to them.
[00:49:32.182 --> 00:49:33.823]  But they claim it's protected.
[00:49:34.484 --> 00:49:37.886]  Now they're announcing in England that they're just going to release all of it.
[00:49:38.346 --> 00:49:46.672]  And if you read the fine print of the BBC report, they admit that it's going to be where you live, your name, everything about you.
[00:49:47.272 --> 00:49:53.937]  And so everyone under the health service, under the eugenics guinea pigging, is now to be a quote, research patient.
[00:49:54.317 --> 00:49:56.318]  And they claim this will give great leaps forward.
[00:49:56.598 --> 00:50:01.902]  What it allows them to do is use the scientific algorithms and actuaries they already have
[00:50:02.962 --> 00:50:03.903]  To go public with it.
[00:50:04.783 --> 00:50:10.805]  Kind of like for decades they've been publishing lists of concealed carry owners around the country in newspapers to harass people.
[00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:15.427]  And it's just part of them getting everybody used to your data being public.
[00:50:15.767 --> 00:50:17.108]  Your most intimate data.
[00:50:17.878 --> 00:50:32.107]  Your most intimate datum, that you had an abortion, that you got herpes, that you got HIV, that you got hepatitis, that you had plastic surgery, that you've got dentures, and then all of that can then be used against you.
[00:50:32.147 --> 00:50:33.668]  So it's just unspeakable.
[00:50:34.268 --> 00:50:40.071]  And here is the traitorous David Cameron, the globalist, who says he won't let people in England vote on being part of the Euro.
[00:50:40.211 --> 00:50:41.772]  They're just part of it and are losing their rights.
[00:50:41.852 --> 00:50:42.413]  That's the way it is.
[00:50:42.893 --> 00:50:50.622]  Here is this disgusting blob up there claiming how great all of this is and how the psychiatrists love our brain scans.
[00:50:51.243 --> 00:50:55.107]  So it's just all part of the scientific dictatorship flaunting their tyranny.
[00:50:55.327 --> 00:50:55.748]  Here it is.
[00:50:56.168 --> 00:51:00.793]  Opening up the vast amounts of data generated in our health service.
[00:51:01.653 --> 00:51:05.879]  From this month, huge amounts of new data are going to be released online.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:12.347]  This is the real-world evidence that scientists have been crying out for, and we're determined to deliver it.
[00:51:13.028 --> 00:51:15.732]  We've seen how powerful the release of data can be.
[00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:25.803]  Thanks to the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, the Institute of Psychiatry now has access to a database covering a quarter of a million patients.
[00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:31.308]  It's got their brain scans, their medical records, their notes, a huge wealth of information.
[00:51:32.049 --> 00:51:39.934]  All consented to, all anonymous, and that is helping them to find new answers in the fight against dementia.
[00:51:40.754 --> 00:51:46.078]  It is simply a waste to have a health system like the NHS and not to do this kind of thing.
[00:51:46.838 --> 00:51:48.019]  So we don't want to stop there.
[00:51:48.599 --> 00:52:00.266]  We're going to consult on actually changing the NHS constitution so that the default setting is for patients' data to be used for research, unless of course they want to opt out.
[00:52:03.015 --> 00:52:04.816]  And then of course they later don't let you opt out.
[00:52:05.156 --> 00:52:15.320]  This is a government, in England as well, it's global unified, standardized, for 40 years, almost 40, 39 plus, they take your blood at birth and then lied about it and got caught.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:16.901]  And say they own your body.
[00:52:18.281 --> 00:52:19.182]  These are eugenicists.
[00:52:20.523 --> 00:52:21.123]  They're your enemy.
[00:52:21.223 --> 00:52:21.844]  They're my enemy.
[00:52:22.384 --> 00:52:23.364]  Okay, that's one report.
[00:52:23.404 --> 00:52:24.265]  I've got about 20 more.
[00:52:24.285 --> 00:52:25.545]  I'm never going to get through all this.
[00:52:26.746 --> 00:52:34.469]  There's a new report out that Bill Clinton collected $50,000 per month from MF Global, while Newt Gingrich got millions from, what was it, Freddie Mac.
[00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:35.730]  No, I don't.
[00:52:53.659 --> 00:52:59.105]  With his own customer's private accounts.
[00:52:59.226 --> 00:53:03.190]  Continuing the real reason for Obama's threat to veto indefinite detention bill.
[00:53:03.631 --> 00:53:05.293]  Hint, it's not to protect liberty.
[00:53:06.093 --> 00:53:09.678]  Obama wants to veto indefinite detention bill because it would hold the U.S.
[00:53:10.098 --> 00:53:11.279]  to the Geneva Convention.
[00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:15.563]  And it would give Congress the power, which it rightfully does, to make law.
[00:53:15.943 --> 00:53:18.765]  Obama's already told them, I'll kill citizens, I'll arrest citizens.
[00:53:19.326 --> 00:53:20.667]  The executive holds that.
[00:53:20.967 --> 00:53:27.972]  And his lawyers came out last week and said he may veto the National Defense Authorization Act because he can use the military in America if he wants.
[00:53:28.292 --> 00:53:29.373]  He can do whatever he wants.
[00:53:29.893 --> 00:53:34.497]  So that's the facts there, and that's now coming out weeks after we told you what was really going on.
[00:53:36.252 --> 00:53:41.355]  There's also not a happy ending to Obama's little Hollywood romance.
[00:53:42.215 --> 00:53:44.697]  He can't make up his mind about anything, said Mr. Lear.
[00:53:44.757 --> 00:53:47.498]  He just vacillates like Democrats do generally.
[00:53:47.918 --> 00:53:49.359]  On taxes, he doesn't take a strong stand.
[00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:51.120]  He can't make up his mind about immigration.
[00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:56.123]  I don't even know if he's come clean on waterboarding or torture, any of those things.
[00:53:56.483 --> 00:53:59.805]  And that's prominent Hollywood people are mad at him because
[00:54:00.765 --> 00:54:02.487]  You know, he hasn't taxed the rich enough.
[00:54:02.507 --> 00:54:04.548]  What do you mean he's financed by the mega elite?
[00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:13.857]  And at the same time, because he's continued all the torture and the rest of it, so that love affair is ending with Obama, who's a nothing teleprompter reading puppet.
[00:54:14.337 --> 00:54:22.204]  Continuing here, British Petroleum accuses Halliburton, same folks running Kellogg Brown and Root, of destroying evidence following Gulf Spill.
[00:54:22.244 --> 00:54:23.665]  BP has accused Halliburton of destroying
[00:54:24.606 --> 00:54:35.999]  Damaging evidence about the quality of its cement that came out day one that went into drilling the well that blew out last year and caused the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
[00:54:36.199 --> 00:54:36.580]  history.
[00:54:37.261 --> 00:54:38.903]  So the rats are turning on each other.
[00:54:39.463 --> 00:54:42.924]  Now getting into the incredible Panopticon surveillance grid.
[00:54:43.804 --> 00:54:50.486]  RT interviewed the inventor of the free software movement and legendary programmer and code person.
[00:54:50.847 --> 00:54:55.308]  Facebook is massive surveillance, says Stallman.
[00:54:56.638 --> 00:54:57.358]  Richard Stallman.
[00:54:57.699 --> 00:55:01.000]  This is an example of malicious features in non-free software.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:07.644]  These mobile phones are being run by non-free software, so it's no surprise that they have malicious features in them.
[00:55:07.984 --> 00:55:11.166]  The most commonly used non-free programs do, Stallman sadly pointed out.
[00:55:12.206 --> 00:55:16.048]  You think an application is one thing, but you're really paying to be surveilled.
[00:55:16.508 --> 00:55:21.530]  And the phone companies and others are making more money off selling your data than they are on the phone program.
[00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:23.190]  And they're tracking everything you do.
[00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:29.993]  They're always finding back doors and Trojan horses in them that began with the Telecommunications Act of 96 and have expanded on since then.
[00:55:31.213 --> 00:55:37.595]  So that's basically what the head of Facebook called his customers dumb F-ers that you trust him.
[00:55:38.175 --> 00:55:39.056]  These are just arrogant
[00:55:39.756 --> 00:55:41.016]  Arrogant dirtbags, folks.
[00:55:41.376 --> 00:55:42.177]  These are slimebags.
[00:55:42.197 --> 00:55:48.658]  They've been chosen to be promoted by the system because they are sociopaths at best, some of them psychopaths.
[00:55:49.259 --> 00:55:55.300]  Alright, now some spectacular news and information and great graphics put together by our own Darren McBreen.
[00:55:56.581 --> 00:56:05.023]  But now we look into the limitless universe with the trillions of galaxies and quadrillions of stars and planets.
[00:56:06.448 --> 00:56:08.709]  To new discoveries by NASA.
[00:56:09.129 --> 00:56:13.271]  NASA telescope confirms alien planet inhabitable zone.
[00:56:13.291 --> 00:56:15.792]  A potentially habitable alien world.
[00:56:15.812 --> 00:56:18.533]  A first for Kepler.
[00:56:20.632 --> 00:56:22.853]  Orbits a star very much like our own sun.
[00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:30.775]  The discovery brings scientists one step closer to finding a planet like our own, one which could conceivably harbor life, scientists said.
[00:56:30.795 --> 00:56:36.117]  It goes on, the new found planet is in a habitable zone called Kelper 22b.
[00:56:36.177 --> 00:56:40.058]  It's located about 600 light years away, orbiting a sun-like star.
[00:56:40.659 --> 00:56:42.479]  Amazing information.
[00:56:42.799 --> 00:56:44.300]  What humanity could do if we just
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:48.844]  Stop the psychopaths from taking control of our society and stop being gullible.
[00:56:49.525 --> 00:56:55.411]  Shifting to another sector of the universe, astronomers have discovered the biggest black holes ever.
[00:56:55.832 --> 00:56:59.616]  Scientists have discovered two of the biggest black holes ever observed.
[00:56:59.736 --> 00:57:06.784]  Each has a mass billions of times greater than the sun, according to a study published Monday.
[00:57:07.739 --> 00:57:15.443]  Just to give you an idea of how massive these are, they can swallow up entire galaxy clusters.
[00:57:15.943 --> 00:57:19.825]  What a gorgeous and limitless cosmos we are a part of.
[00:57:20.865 --> 00:57:26.508]  Our consciousness and being alive and able to observe this is an incredible gift from the Creator.
[00:57:27.028 --> 00:57:29.730]  And if you don't think something made all this, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57:31.331 --> 00:57:46.884]  My God, can you imagine our consciousness and our intellect and we are tiny little creatures living in a thin ribbon of life on the surface of a globe which is just microscopic in comparison to the majesty of what's around us.
[00:57:47.044 --> 00:57:57.193]  It is awe-inspiring and we see a bunch of crusty globalists rubbing their hands together, cheating the population and spiking our water with poison.
[00:57:57.233 --> 00:57:59.395]  It's just, you got to feel sorry for them.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:01.621]  In the final equation.
[00:58:02.342 --> 00:58:05.605]  Alright, I want to get to a review of Clockwork Orange.
[00:58:06.806 --> 00:58:08.488]  Guys, what do we have up next in the queue?
[00:58:08.708 --> 00:58:13.933]  The Clockwork Orange or the hit piece on the Corbett Report?
[00:58:16.736 --> 00:58:19.738]  Okay, let's go ahead and do the Corbett Report right now.
[00:58:20.994 --> 00:58:22.555]  Look, I talked about this on the radio today.
[00:58:22.595 --> 00:58:29.537]  I'm not going to spend all day on it right now, because obviously we've got more pressing issues, but this is how they use humor to discredit things.
[00:58:30.397 --> 00:58:32.538]  And simply put, they use a lot of tricks here.
[00:58:32.838 --> 00:58:40.060]  They talk about space aliens at the Denver airport, and cut to video of myself in the background, but I don't talk about space aliens.
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:45.702]  They cut to an old lady who's a greeter at the airport turning into a vampire, implying that we're saying that.
[00:58:46.263 --> 00:58:47.623]  They make fun of Jesse Ventura.
[00:58:47.864 --> 00:58:50.385]  And they cut to a guy who's clearly trying to be goofy.
[00:58:50.985 --> 00:58:56.428]  He's playing a piano out by a rushing river, acting extremely goofy with a bouncing ball.
[00:58:57.168 --> 00:58:58.428]  You know, like in the old cartoons.
[00:58:59.209 --> 00:59:00.369]  I mean, the whole thing's a joke.
[00:59:00.629 --> 00:59:06.431]  Denver Airport, they don't mention, has giant obelisks and weird Egyptian gods like Anubis out front.
[00:59:06.851 --> 00:59:13.453]  It's got murals of Nazis chopping up children and Spanish Civil War fascists chopping people up.
[00:59:15.613 --> 00:59:16.934]  It's got underground bases.
[00:59:17.094 --> 00:59:23.896]  It's based in the state that has the head of NORTHCOM in it with admitted underground bases there at NORAD.
[00:59:24.876 --> 00:59:26.837]  In Colorado Springs, right down the road.
[00:59:27.377 --> 00:59:33.940]  I mean, I flew in there like a year and a half ago to go to Hardin, Montana, and there's bizarre Egyptian pyramids everywhere, and there's Anubis.
[00:59:34.601 --> 00:59:36.682]  I mean, it's just, it's beyond bizarre.
[00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:43.865]  And then they cut to some guy talking about phallic symbols, and they cut to a statue of a stallion's sexual member.
[00:59:44.845 --> 00:59:52.089]  And this is designed for people who've heard us talk about the Denver Airport and all the weird iconography, to just say, oh, that's those crazy people.
[00:59:52.887 --> 01:00:00.189]  And so it's a classic hit piece because it's these illuminous religion to be into all this occultic stuff while we're ignorant of it.
[01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:01.570]  And we're exposing it.
[01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.231]  So they do this straw man guilt by association.
[01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:05.311]  I'm not going to play the whole thing.
[01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.092]  But let's go ahead and play the intro of this.
[01:00:08.412 --> 01:00:09.433]  This aired last night.
[01:00:09.673 --> 01:00:20.156]  This is... Mysteries of the Ancient Unknown.
[01:00:20.176 --> 01:00:20.156]  2012.
[01:00:20.436 --> 01:00:22.197]  End of Times.
[01:00:24.509 --> 01:00:29.417]  America, long may she wave, but how long?
[01:00:29.437 --> 01:00:34.826]  When the end times come, the last words you hear just may be...
[01:00:37.779 --> 01:00:53.149]  And we'll get to her in a minute, but notice they also imply, if you think all the weird murals and obelisks and Egyptian gods that are 50, 60 feet tall, you land and there's pyramids and Egyptian gods and obelisks, and you ask, what is this?
[01:00:53.209 --> 01:00:54.770]  And they say, shut up and get out of here!
[01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:57.131]  Why are there all these Egyptian gods here?
[01:00:57.411 --> 01:00:58.592]  What's up with all these giant tents?
[01:00:58.892 --> 01:01:01.374]  Why do they keep digging over ground there for a decade?
[01:01:01.854 --> 01:01:05.877]  The construction workers say there's a giant underground basis, and they admit they're all over Colorado.
[01:01:06.883 --> 01:01:08.826]  Underground railways, I've talked to whistleblowers.
[01:01:09.067 --> 01:01:11.610]  You're like, why are there all these big pyramids and obelisks, phallic symbols?
[01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:12.512]  Shut up, crazy!
[01:01:12.532 --> 01:01:13.213]  Shut up, crazy!
[01:01:13.513 --> 01:01:14.915]  You think old ladies are vampires!
[01:01:15.937 --> 01:01:17.720]  Alex Jones thinks space aliens are there.
[01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:19.923]  This is the type of stuff they do.
[01:01:20.484 --> 01:01:21.345]  And they're angry about it.
[01:01:22.515 --> 01:01:24.598]  They believe it's on some magical site.
[01:01:24.718 --> 01:01:26.140]  I'm not into all this, the Globalist are.
[01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:28.202]  They believe it's on some ley line.
[01:01:28.763 --> 01:01:30.365]  And they do weird rituals out there.
[01:01:30.445 --> 01:01:34.230]  Maury Strong and Ted Turner, on record, go to their own Bohemian Grove there.
[01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.592]  I'm not Skull and Bones.
[01:01:35.672 --> 01:01:36.673]  I'm not Bohemian Grove.
[01:01:37.034 --> 01:01:38.656]  I'm not doing what our presidents are doing.
[01:01:38.956 --> 01:01:39.917]  They're the weirdos!
[01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:42.119]  And they think they're getting power out of this.
[01:01:42.179 --> 01:01:42.819]  Maybe they are.
[01:01:42.859 --> 01:01:43.539]  They're in power.
[01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:47.160]  And then we're bad and we go, hey man, you're into some weird stuff.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:51.442]  They've got weird masonic cornerstones all over the place.
[01:01:51.462 --> 01:01:54.282]  Alright, let's just go back to the piece.
[01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:58.424]  But they're implying we think the end of the world's coming because we question what's happening there.
[01:01:58.864 --> 01:02:04.586]  And then when the end of the world doesn't come in 2012, as I've said it isn't, I'll be blamed and they'll say I did say this.
[01:02:05.799 --> 01:02:08.362]  So this is just meant for people to go, oh, that's those kooks again.
[01:02:08.862 --> 01:02:09.503]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:02:09.523 --> 01:02:10.864]  You guys are discredited anyways.
[01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.786]  So make your jokes, Colbert.
[01:02:13.107 --> 01:02:14.288]  We'll continue to expose you.
[01:02:14.608 --> 01:02:15.029]  Here it is.
[01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:16.570]  Here just may be.
[01:02:17.111 --> 01:02:19.413]  Welcome to Denver International Airport.
[01:02:22.526 --> 01:02:24.789]  The Denver International Airport.
[01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:33.659]  It may look like a transportation hub, but conspiracy experts have long speculated that there's something more sinister going on.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.783]  There's a lot of strange things about this airport.
[01:02:36.863 --> 01:02:38.865]  Secret bunkers built for a 2012 apocalypse.
[01:02:40.307 --> 01:02:45.513]  To bring Americans in on aircraft, disappear underground, into prisons and execution centers.
[01:02:45.674 --> 01:02:49.098]  Denver Airport's runways have resembled a Nazi swastika.
[01:02:49.278 --> 01:02:52.642]  Many believe it's being used for government cover-up.
[01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:53.864]  Super creepy!
[01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.886]  What the hell is this?
[01:02:56.186 --> 01:02:58.109]  What the hell, indeed.
[01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:02.471]  Obviously, not all of these theories can be true.
[01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:06.711]  So we went to find out what's the real story here.
[01:03:07.091 --> 01:03:10.992]  The real story here at Denver International Airport is we're an airport.
[01:03:11.612 --> 01:03:13.853]  This is airport spokesman, Jeff Keene.
[01:03:13.873 --> 01:03:14.153]  Hit pause.
[01:03:15.273 --> 01:03:15.793]  Hit pause.
[01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:18.994]  Oh, oh, they say, what is going on here?
[01:03:19.314 --> 01:03:20.594]  You notice he goes with the escalator.
[01:03:20.634 --> 01:03:25.715]  You can see in the background naked body scanners that they admit frying you with high-powered radiation.
[01:03:27.352 --> 01:03:28.652]  Look at them, look at the blue scanners.
[01:03:28.953 --> 01:03:29.693]  What's going on here?
[01:03:29.713 --> 01:03:30.033]  I don't know.
[01:03:30.693 --> 01:03:41.917]  My own crew member, Michelle, her one-year-old daughter and seven-year-old daughter, they tried to have a man stick their hands down her pants last year and a half ago, two Novembers ago, it made national news.
[01:03:42.517 --> 01:03:45.618]  The TSA said it didn't happen and then photos came out of them doing it to other people.
[01:03:46.886 --> 01:03:47.826]  They said they'd stop it.
[01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:48.686]  They haven't stopped it.
[01:03:49.126 --> 01:03:51.167]  They're now all over the news groping old ladies.
[01:03:51.187 --> 01:03:52.727]  I don't think I even got to that report yet.
[01:03:53.187 --> 01:03:54.727]  There's so much news I can't even cover it all.
[01:03:55.048 --> 01:03:56.708]  Now dozens of people are coming out.
[01:03:56.768 --> 01:03:57.608]  Videos are coming out.
[01:03:57.808 --> 01:04:00.168]  They're strip-searching old ladies behind closed doors.
[01:04:01.449 --> 01:04:02.729]  So what is going on here?
[01:04:03.149 --> 01:04:13.131]  I mean, you know, Colbert gets into this guy talking about phallic symbols who then obviously is trying to discredit things or doesn't know what he's talking about.
[01:04:14.397 --> 01:04:17.218]  And they don't show any of the big obelisks that are inside and outside.
[01:04:17.238 --> 01:04:20.960]  They don't show... I mean, why are there all these giant Egyptian gods?
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.981]  In fact, put the photo up.
[01:04:22.361 --> 01:04:24.802]  I shot video of this a year and a half ago, never even played it.
[01:04:24.822 --> 01:04:25.802]  You can go land there.
[01:04:25.822 --> 01:04:31.525]  I mean, they've got giant Anubis gods that are 50-something feet tall and pyramids everywhere.
[01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.106]  I mean, what is this in an airport?
[01:04:33.126 --> 01:04:35.027]  They're like, we're not going to discuss that right now.
[01:04:35.447 --> 01:04:38.688]  Why are there giant earth-moving equipment and underground digging going on?
[01:04:39.969 --> 01:04:41.810]  Shut up, crazy man, we don't want to discuss it.
[01:04:43.390 --> 01:04:45.891]  Why are there all these murals of Nazis chopping up children?
[01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:46.951]  We're not going to talk about it.
[01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:53.812]  And there in Colorado Springs, they've got the head of NORAD based right there.
[01:04:54.232 --> 01:04:54.953]  Cheyenne Mountain.
[01:04:55.873 --> 01:04:56.133]  Alright.
[01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.633]  I'm not going to play any more of it.
[01:04:58.673 --> 01:04:59.834]  It just gets more ridiculous.
[01:05:00.834 --> 01:05:09.156]  Well, we have the short clip where they say aliens, and then they show video of me in the background as if I'm seeing aliens at the airport.
[01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.331]  It's so frustrating to see this.
[01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:36.454]  They had a History Channel here last week asking about aliens, and I said, I'm not getting into it.
[01:05:36.935 --> 01:05:39.518]  I cover real issues, real things I can prove.
[01:05:40.179 --> 01:05:42.301]  Okay, totally jam-packed.
[01:05:43.484 --> 01:05:50.368]  I just want to commend the crew and you, the subscribers of PrisonPlanet.tv and InforgedNews.com for making all this possible.
[01:05:50.408 --> 01:05:51.869]  We had big breakthroughs this week.
[01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:55.150]  Most big subscription sites don't even have this.
[01:05:55.731 --> 01:05:59.012]  All of our features now are available on iPhones and iPads and everything.
[01:05:59.553 --> 01:06:00.833]  And we're just going to add more and more.
[01:06:00.853 --> 01:06:03.835]  We're about to hire more reporters, more crew members, more researchers.
[01:06:04.415 --> 01:06:08.738]  If I can find somebody, more hosts, because I've got a few great people that can fill in on the show.
[01:06:10.389 --> 01:06:13.411]  But we want to have just a bigger team, so it's not just Alex Jones here.
[01:06:13.731 --> 01:06:15.752]  We want everybody's research and perspective here.
[01:06:16.713 --> 01:06:18.334]  And I'm just very, very excited about it.
[01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:23.696]  I want to add a feature to the show where we do film reviews.
[01:06:23.837 --> 01:06:25.137]  I thought about doing it for a while.
[01:06:25.197 --> 01:06:27.599]  John Bowne had recommended we do it.
[01:06:28.159 --> 01:06:38.665]  Tomorrow night we're going to do seven days in May about the military using continuity of government programs to launch martial law in the United States.
[01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:43.291]  So we're going to be going over that tomorrow evening.
[01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:51.475]  But I wanted tonight to get into an iconic film, and that of course is Clockwork Orange, based on the novel A Clockwork Orange.
[01:06:52.256 --> 01:06:54.377]  And of course Stanley Kubrick directed this in 1971, I had said 1973.
[01:06:54.497 --> 01:06:56.678]  And so now we'll go ahead and get into that review.
[01:06:56.698 --> 01:06:57.038]  In closing,
[01:07:06.801 --> 01:07:15.604]  In the film A Clockwork Orange, it is a 2015 or so world.
[01:07:16.064 --> 01:07:32.871]  There's a giant welfare class, huge levels of crime, spoiled rotten hippies have given birth to children who then gave birth in turn to kind of a Generation X crowd that just likes to loot and rob and steal and is obsessed with taking psychotropic drugs.
[01:07:34.171 --> 01:07:46.660]  And in the film, there are political dissidents who are aware of the Pavlovian brainwashing that's going on, who are against it, but they end up getting set up and framed and sent to prison for exposing what's happening.
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.503]  It gets into television, being used as an operant conditioning, mind control device.
[01:07:52.804 --> 01:08:00.369]  In this first little clip I have, it's Stanley Kubrick starring Malcolm McDowell, Warner Brothers, based on a novel by Anthony Burgess, 1962.
[01:08:00.409 --> 01:08:01.489]  Again, came out in
[01:08:06.474 --> 01:08:11.278]  71 and we'll go ahead and go to the first part of the movie review.
[01:08:11.779 --> 01:08:15.703]  Again, where you have the thugs out beating the poor old bum.
[01:08:15.723 --> 01:08:20.727]  You've got the society breaking down, nobody caring about anything.
[01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:27.334]  Where I lived was with my dad and mom in Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North.
[01:08:38.737 --> 01:08:45.525]  Okay, so this is basically the social engineers letting you know what they're planning and what they are setting up.
[01:08:47.387 --> 01:08:48.388]  Continuing here...
[01:08:49.780 --> 01:09:05.158]  This is a key clip where the Minister of the Interior is touring the prison, discusses overcrowding and hardening, says government may soon need space for political prisoners, so they need to clean out the actual violent prisoners, wants to release common criminals.
[01:09:06.119 --> 01:09:20.116]  And Alex, that's the name of the gang leader, speaks up and is chosen for the brainwashing MKUltra experiment to cure him of his psychopathic desires.
[01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:23.700]  And of course the movie's all about the state being run by psychopaths.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:24.601]  Let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:09:24.977 --> 01:09:26.818]  Strand criminals together and what do you get?
[01:09:27.298 --> 01:09:28.739]  Concentrated criminality.
[01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.720]  Crime in the midst of punishment.
[01:09:30.980 --> 01:09:31.561]  I agree, sir.
[01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:33.001]  Would we need a larger prison?
[01:09:33.242 --> 01:09:33.722]  More money?
[01:09:34.782 --> 01:09:36.123]  Not a chance, my dear sir.
[01:09:36.143 --> 01:09:40.626]  The government can't be concerned any longer without moaning penological theories.
[01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:44.288]  Soon we may be needing all our prison space for political offenders.
[01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:48.390]  Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis.
[01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:51.091]  Kill that criminal reflex, that's all.
[01:09:51.912 --> 01:09:53.653]  Full implementation in a year's time.
[01:09:56.929 --> 01:10:05.014]  Now, you also notice that there's a subliminal image there, but at the end of this piece I'll point it out.
[01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:12.359]  Nurse explains the Ludovico treatment is about to begin.
[01:10:12.419 --> 01:10:15.801]  Just watch the films and we're going to administer a vitamin injection.
[01:10:16.321 --> 01:10:20.644]  Alex describes straitjacket, lid locks and brain monitor cables.
[01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.025]  So here's a clip of that.
[01:10:22.045 --> 01:10:24.867]  In a few minutes you'll meet Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment.
[01:10:25.831 --> 01:10:28.112]  What exactly is the treatment here going to be, then?
[01:10:28.932 --> 01:10:30.112]  It's quite simple, really.
[01:10:30.132 --> 01:10:32.713]  We're just going to show you some films.
[01:10:33.293 --> 01:10:36.714]  Where I was taken to, brothers, was like no cine I ever videoed before.
[01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:44.256]  I was bound up in a straitjacket, and the gulliver was strapped to a headrest with like wires running away from it.
[01:10:45.397 --> 01:10:50.218]  Then they clamped like lid locks on the eyes, so that I could not shut them, no matter how hard I tried.
[01:10:51.983 --> 01:10:57.167]  Alright, now after the week-long brainwashing, and again, you get a softer form of this in the television.
[01:10:57.567 --> 01:11:01.910]  Some people now have convulsions watching certain shows when they turn the flicker rate up too much.
[01:11:03.711 --> 01:11:07.594]  This is where an actor assaults him and he's unable to resist it.
[01:11:07.974 --> 01:11:11.817]  And this is kind of the learned helplessness that the general public is actually put through.
[01:11:12.918 --> 01:11:14.438]  And that's why this film is so sophisticated.
[01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:28.901]  It shows that this treatment makes good people unable to defend themselves, and that it makes bad people unable, at the low level, to operate as they truly are, so that the super psychopaths above have a group of helpless minions under them.
[01:11:29.201 --> 01:11:29.982]  Let's go to that clip.
[01:11:34.643 --> 01:11:36.683]  I began to feel really sick.
[01:11:38.365 --> 01:11:40.026]  But I could not shut me glasses.
[01:11:40.626 --> 01:11:47.970]  Very soon now, the drug will cause the subject to experience a death-like paralysis, together with deep feelings of terror.
[01:11:48.430 --> 01:12:01.036]  And it is during this period, we've found, the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his catastrophic experience of violence and the violence he sees.
[01:12:02.537 --> 01:12:07.339]  Okay, and then here's the clip where they're testing out his conditioning.
[01:12:09.736 --> 01:12:14.299]  If you wanna get out, you gotta do something for me.
[01:12:14.359 --> 01:12:14.599]  Here.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:15.920]  Is that you?
[01:12:18.102 --> 01:12:19.082]  Well, I want you to lick it.
[01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.166]  Lick it!
[01:12:24.246 --> 01:12:33.151]  Would you believe your faithful friend and long-suffering narrator pushed out his red Yazik a mile and a half to lick the Grasney Vonney boots?
[01:12:34.212 --> 01:12:35.773]  And again!
[01:12:36.213 --> 01:12:38.215]  The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up.
[01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:46.434]  Okay, here's the prison chaplain who's observed this, pointing out that he has lost his free will.
[01:12:47.495 --> 01:12:50.537]  And that he's been rendered indivisibly an automaton.
[01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:54.340]  He ceases to be a wrongdoer!
[01:12:54.781 --> 01:12:58.584]  He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice!
[01:12:59.524 --> 01:13:01.586]  Padre, these are subtleties.
[01:13:02.126 --> 01:13:04.868]  We're not concerned with motives, with a higher ethics.
[01:13:05.549 --> 01:13:08.191]  We are concerned only with cutting down crime!
[01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.006]  ...with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.
[01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:18.613]  He will be your true Christian.
[01:13:19.355 --> 01:13:20.918]  Ready to turn the other key...
[01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:27.454]  Okay, continuing with this teleprompter-free news and film analysis.
[01:13:28.215 --> 01:13:43.107]  Now he's been released after being brainwashed, and he's unable to defend himself when he's assaulted, he's unable to desire a woman, and then they actually have this Pavlovian conditioning aversion treatment, that's what they call it, a subset.
[01:13:44.315 --> 01:13:53.838]  The same homeless alcoholics, the hobos, that he'd beaten up, they find him, they beat him up, and his old gang member friends show up.
[01:13:53.958 --> 01:13:55.679]  They're now police officers.
[01:13:56.039 --> 01:13:57.719]  That's a clip we should have played in the film.
[01:13:58.079 --> 01:14:02.461]  They describe the revolutionaries who are writing the novel A Clockwork Orange.
[01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:05.204]  That's what the film's named after.
[01:14:05.865 --> 01:14:17.842]  They describe how the state and the wedge of authoritarianism and totalitarianism is coming in are hiring the criminals to be the new police force, which is what Stalin and Hitler and others actually did.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.423]  And we'll get to a clip later where he speaks out against this.
[01:14:23.923 --> 01:14:32.969]  You know, the people that are speaking out against this actually get arrested and imprisoned for trying to write the novel exposing the state's general mind control program.
[01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:39.993]  A very sophisticated novel, that's why Kubrick picked it up, because it's based on what was really going on at the time and a projection of where we'd be today.
[01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:48.138]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Alex rescued and then beaten by his old Droog gang, now police.
[01:14:48.158 --> 01:14:48.539]  Here it is.
[01:14:49.299 --> 01:14:50.360]  Back away!
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:52.001]  I'm right with you!
[01:14:52.081 --> 01:14:53.342]  What's your trouble, sir?
[01:14:57.044 --> 01:14:57.644]  Oh no!
[01:14:58.525 --> 01:15:03.868]  Well!
[01:15:03.988 --> 01:15:05.589]  Well, well, well!
[01:15:05.669 --> 01:15:06.409]  It's impossible!
[01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.050]  I don't believe it!
[01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:10.071]  Evidence of the old classes!
[01:15:10.832 --> 01:15:12.333]  Nothing up our sleeves!
[01:15:12.573 --> 01:15:14.294]  No magic, little Alex!
[01:15:15.194 --> 01:15:18.016]  A job for two, who are now of job age!
[01:15:20.131 --> 01:15:25.474]  And we have the next clip where they waterboard him, which we've now been taught is what the good guys do.
[01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:32.799]  One of the oldest forms of torture, simulated asphyxiation via dihydrogen monoxide.
[01:15:32.839 --> 01:15:33.239]  Here it is.
[01:15:58.081 --> 01:15:58.883]  Ah, the good guys.
[01:16:00.887 --> 01:16:01.728]  The good guys, too.
[01:16:07.339 --> 01:16:08.301]  That goes on and on.
[01:16:09.955 --> 01:16:10.735]  Here's another clip.
[01:16:10.895 --> 01:16:27.440]  Minister visits Alex after he's picked up, tortured, breaks his conditioning, near death and reprogramming, says never meant harm, and of course you realize the minister is a psychopath just like little Alex, will provide a good job for Alex if he gives pro-government press.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:41.286]  And they've put away the subversive writer, who in the novel, Clockwork Orange, is writing the novel, A Clockwork Orange, about the giant mind control society, and how the state's hiring criminals, and how the state is run by criminals.
[01:16:42.447 --> 01:16:44.247]  So here is that clip.
[01:16:44.628 --> 01:16:45.908]  Let me help you with that, shall I?
[01:16:46.748 --> 01:16:47.329]  Thank you, sir.
[01:16:47.529 --> 01:16:47.909]  Thank you.
[01:16:48.769 --> 01:16:55.072]  I can tell you with all sincerity that I, and the government of which I'm a member, are deeply sorry about this, my boy.
[01:16:55.432 --> 01:16:56.113]  Deeply sorry.
[01:16:57.369 --> 01:16:58.270]  We tried to help you.
[01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:05.796]  There is also a certain man, a writer of subversive literature, who has been howling for your blood.
[01:17:06.717 --> 01:17:11.240]  He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now.
[01:17:12.321 --> 01:17:13.442]  We put him away.
[01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:17.425]  Now, in closing here at the end of the nightly news,
[01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:20.911]  That we first covered the FEMA camps.
[01:17:21.632 --> 01:17:25.857]  And we started the show, of course, where I was actually live, not just taping this before we went live.
[01:17:25.877 --> 01:17:32.424]  We were so busy covering the news, like a snake eating itself, we meet back, you know, where we began.
[01:17:34.869 --> 01:17:36.390]  We have a couple subliminals from the film.
[01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:41.631]  It's got hundreds of them in it, but I thought I'd point out subliminals that speak to your subconscious from Stanley Kubrick.
[01:17:42.031 --> 01:17:52.133]  First off, we have a pyramid with capstone on prison wall with the pyramid actually being elevated and we'll put that subliminal up on screen.
[01:17:53.413 --> 01:17:54.414]  Multiple scenes of that.
[01:17:54.494 --> 01:17:59.955]  See the pyramid there on the back wall with the risen capstone above it.
[01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:09.707]  And there's another semi-subliminal when he comes in to get his Ludwig van Beethoven music.
[01:18:10.628 --> 01:18:14.273]  You see 2001 Space Odyssey there.
[01:18:14.293 --> 01:18:15.915]  And then of course there's another one.
[01:18:17.102 --> 01:18:27.225]  Officer Dim has badge 665, unavoidably referencing 666, or the beast, or the beast about to be fulfilled.
[01:18:27.285 --> 01:18:34.447]  I mean, it's just absolutely chocked full of it in that 1971 clockwork orange, and that's only the tip of the iceberg, as they say.
[01:18:34.787 --> 01:18:41.568]  Tomorrow night, seven days in May, and more and more, I'm going to just show you where all this is inculcated in our media.
[01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:43.249]  Some people do it to warn you.
[01:18:45.231 --> 01:18:46.572]  Others do it to condition you.
[01:18:46.672 --> 01:18:48.713]  Others do it just to have a laugh with their friends.
[01:18:49.053 --> 01:18:57.117]  But most of it is about revelation of the method, because the establishment believes it's important for you to know what's being done to you, at least at a subconscious level, before they do it.
[01:18:57.497 --> 01:18:58.958]  Alright, incredible job of the crew.
[01:18:59.018 --> 01:19:07.222]  It's a testament to how dedicated we are that these shows end up being two, three hours long sometimes, instead of thirty minutes, because we just care so much.
[01:19:07.282 --> 01:19:11.424]  And because of your support, being subscribers of PrisonPlanet.tv, we are about to hire
[01:19:11.724 --> 01:19:17.349]  More reporters, more editors, more people, so we can even do more quality work for you here at the InfoWars family.
[01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.172]  So again, we do have a special running until Christmas.
[01:19:20.512 --> 01:19:23.735]  You can get 44% off on a year membership, 5.3 months free.
[01:19:24.196 --> 01:19:27.559]  You pay for 6.7 months, obviously, at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:19:27.599 --> 01:19:31.403]  And then you get to see it first, and then we, of course, disseminate it everywhere on the free web.
[01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:33.324]  Millions watch it every single week.
[01:19:33.605 --> 01:19:36.427]  Okay, that's it for InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:19:37.148 --> 01:19:40.430]  And I know you've got a lot of choices out there in media, and I appreciate you watching.
[01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:41.291]  I appreciate my crew.
[01:19:41.311 --> 01:19:43.432]  I don't see much of their family to bring this to you.
[01:19:43.792 --> 01:19:50.877]  And God willing, we'll see you back here tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Central while we still can communicate with you.
[01:19:51.478 --> 01:19:54.440]  If we weren't having an effect, they wouldn't be trying to call for censorship right now.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:56.281]  That's it for InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:20:16.834 --> 01:20:16.937]  Yeah.
