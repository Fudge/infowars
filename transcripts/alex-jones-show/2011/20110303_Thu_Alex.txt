[00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.234]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:10.675]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:12.417]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:16.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.263]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.311]  We're live, my friends.
[00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:33.533]  It is Thursday, the third day of March 2011.
[00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:40.179]  I had to bail out of the broadcast yesterday with a 24-hour stomach bug.
[00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.341]  Now my wife and other children have it.
[00:00:44.482 --> 00:00:50.146]  I guess my oldest daughter brought it home from playing with her friends, but I bailed out yesterday.
[00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:56.051]  I appreciate Paul Watson and Aaron Dykes taking over for us, but I'm about 95% back and
[00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:05.076]  I want to thank you for joining us today because obviously there is so much important information.
[00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:21.062]  I thought about not coming in this morning when I still felt a bit wheezy when I got up about 7 a.m., but I saw the news and knew that I absolutely had to come in here and cover all of this news and information today.
[00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:22.743]  So we're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:01:23.143 --> 00:01:24.324]  Very important broadcast.
[00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:27.265]  Max Keiser was in Beirut, Lebanon.
[00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:33.689]  On Tuesday, today he is in Cairo, Egypt and is joining us later in the broadcast.
[00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.831]  It may even be video Skype, but whatever works better.
[00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:48.199]  We'll be having him either audio or video and audio today with a report from the embattled North African nation of Egypt, the epicenter of the turmoil we're seeing.
[00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.802]  Here's the London Telegraph headline, Saudi Arabia contagion triggers Gulf route.
[00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:56.965]  Oil prices continuing to go up as the
[00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:07.330]  Arab country dumps billions more in welfare and emergency welfare to the public trying to stem riots.
[00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:13.451]  They've also sent tanks to Bahrain, nearby country to Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:20.278]  We have the Wall Street Journal echoing what Porter Stansbury and EndOfAmerica3.com has been covering.
[00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:23.200]  Why the dollar's reign is near an end.
[00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:29.006]  For decades the dollar has served as the world's main reserve currency, but argues Barry
[00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.111]  I can green.
[00:02:31.272 --> 00:02:32.995]  It will soon have to share that role.
[00:02:33.055 --> 00:02:36.761]  Here's why and what it will mean for international markets and companies.
[00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:40.628]  What will it mean for American consumers and purchasers?
[00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.988]  What will it mean for people on fixed incomes?
[00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.409]  I read this article.
[00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:56.576]  They don't really hit the main issue of the fact that the dollar will then accelerate, is the key word, its hyperinflation curve once the other shoe drops.
[00:02:56.756 --> 00:02:58.036]  That's the big issue here.
[00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:01.819]  Not so much what's going to happen in markets around the world.
[00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:10.922]  Uh, and also, uh, we have reports dealing with jobless claims, what's happening in China with their currency.
[00:03:10.942 --> 00:03:13.683]  Uh, that is all coming up today.
[00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:17.405]  I had about an hour and a half talk with Charlie Sheen last night.
[00:03:18.505 --> 00:03:19.686]  Boy, if, uh...
[00:03:20.606 --> 00:03:23.628]  These hills could talk, but I won't be talking about it.
[00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:26.890]  But it does look like there's a light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.612]  In fact, what I'll do is you guys remind me and make me do this.
[00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.275]  At 1.30, we got 30 minutes left in the broadcast.
[00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:37.457]  I'll spend five minutes on what I can tell you about Charlie Sheen.
[00:03:37.477 --> 00:03:38.238]  I've got to think about it.
[00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:43.641]  He didn't tell me not to talk about the things he told me, but I just he talks to me because I never talk about it.
[00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:45.463]  But so much is going on.
[00:03:45.503 --> 00:03:50.086]  If I can talk about it to try to help Charlie and let folks know where he is mentally,
[00:03:51.006 --> 00:03:58.288]  And economically, and we're two and a half men's going, obviously we are the epicenter of what happened with Charlie Sheen starting seven days ago.
[00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.450]  Last Thursday, here on the broadcast, I was blindsided by it, just like you were.
[00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.491]  And now it is still the biggest story, not in the United States, but worldwide.
[00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:11.873]  Bigger than the economic meltdown that we are now going deeper into.
[00:04:12.813 --> 00:04:15.734]  And obviously I don't think that should be the case, but it is the case.
[00:04:16.394 --> 00:04:18.295]  And Charlie didn't ask for any of this to happen.
[00:04:18.495 --> 00:04:22.897]  He just was tired of being harassed and suppressed and quote the AA cult.
[00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:25.798]  But I will give you some tidbits of news.
[00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:32.461]  Mainly because the mainstream media keeps calling here in droves asking me questions or asking for Charlie's number and I'm not giving it to them.
[00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:41.785]  But if the mainstream media and those obsessed with these things want to hear about it, I'll spend five minutes on it at 1.30 Central Standard Time when we come out of break today.
[00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:42.846]  Obviously,
[00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:46.518]  This has turned into some good things.
[00:04:47.198 --> 00:04:51.242]  Millions and millions of people who've never heard of the Alex Jones Show are finding it.
[00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:56.788]  And our numbers across the board are off the charts right now.
[00:04:56.888 --> 00:04:59.711]  So certainly a lot of people are learning about the New World Order.
[00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:04.021]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:08.224]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:13.107]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:18.370]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:26.154]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.261]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:34.422 --> 00:05:35.862]  We're American and be proud.
[00:05:36.062 --> 00:05:38.783]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:38.803 --> 00:05:42.844]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:47.045]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:59.477]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:00.458 --> 00:06:03.780]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.120]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.522]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:06:09.743 --> 00:06:15.385]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:06:15.685 --> 00:06:17.666]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:06:17.827 --> 00:06:20.508]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:06:20.848 --> 00:06:27.153]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:29.155]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:34.640]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.904]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:06:40.185 --> 00:06:45.349]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:48.512]  This will freeze the cost your food while you can still afford it.
[00:06:48.752 --> 00:06:51.694]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:52.515]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:04.888]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:05.228 --> 00:07:09.150]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.371]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:11.391 --> 00:07:16.833]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:17.273 --> 00:07:23.495]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:23.935 --> 00:07:29.478]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:33.600]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.062]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:43.885]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:44.325 --> 00:07:47.266]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:47.887 --> 00:07:49.307]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:49.848 --> 00:07:50.288]  It's here.
[00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:57.976]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:05.545]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.906 --> 00:08:08.188]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.997 --> 00:08:15.360]  There certainly is a war on for your mind.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.182]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:17.342 --> 00:08:21.326]  It is Thursday, the third day of March 2011.
[00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:30.234]  Max Keiser joins us coming up in the next hour from Cairo, Egypt, on all the things that he's witnessing unfolding there.
[00:08:31.215 --> 00:08:35.478]  In other news, first call for impeachment by a member of Congress.
[00:08:36.078 --> 00:08:42.983]  Absolutely, Trent Frankstel's blog, citing abandonment of the DOMA law.
[00:08:43.323 --> 00:08:50.968]  Republican congressman has told a left-leaning blog that there is a collective support he would favor the impeachment of Barack Obama.
[00:08:51.548 --> 00:08:55.150]  Over his decision to stop defending the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.
[00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.971]  Scott Keyes of ThinkProgress.org asked U.S.
[00:08:59.011 --> 00:09:16.079]  Representative Trent Franks of Arizona, a Republican, I know Duke Genrich has come out and said that if they don't reverse course here, we ought to be talking about possibly impeaching either Attorney General Eric Holder or even President Obama to try to get them to reverse course.
[00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:18.720]  Do you think that is something you would support?
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.441]  And the Congressman said yes.
[00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:22.021]  So we have that here.
[00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:26.362]  Hillary Clinton told Congress on U.S.
[00:09:26.402 --> 00:09:31.343]  Foreign Policy Priority Committee yesterday that, quote, we're losing the info war.
[00:09:31.784 --> 00:09:35.564]  That is the globalists that have hijacked this nation and much of the rest of the world.
[00:09:35.904 --> 00:09:39.865]  She used the term info war, saying no one believes the U.S.
[00:09:40.025 --> 00:09:40.946]  media anymore.
[00:09:41.466 --> 00:09:41.886]  That's right.
[00:09:43.044 --> 00:09:47.569]  The only way you can hurt someone is by endorsing them, Hillary.
[00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:54.317]  That's what I told Politico last year about Rand Paul when they were trying to destroy him in the media with lies.
[00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:55.338]  I said, don't you get it?
[00:09:55.878 --> 00:10:00.423]  The only way the mainstream media can defeat Rand Paul is by endorsing him.
[00:10:01.244 --> 00:10:09.627]  When you attack us, you only validate what we're doing because you are completely and totally discredited.
[00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:12.308]  I want to play that clip of Hillary coming up a little bit later.
[00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:15.850]  Also continuing here, top Republicans
[00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.610]  are shying away from presidential bids.
[00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:23.771]  More prominent Republicans have taken themselves out of contention for 2012 U.S.
[00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:27.632]  presidential race and have officially joined the contest to challenge Barack Obama.
[00:10:28.172 --> 00:10:31.373]  And we'll talk more about why they say that that is happening.
[00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:35.954]  Continuing here, the Wisconsin stalemate could drag on for months.
[00:10:35.994 --> 00:10:38.774]  The Associated Press is reporting.
[00:10:39.295 --> 00:10:42.635]  That's just some of the news that we're going to be going over on that front.
[00:10:43.315 --> 00:10:45.696]  And of course the really big news is on the
[00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:49.101]  economic front here today.
[00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:53.890]  Wall Street Journal, why the dollar's reign is near an end.
[00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:57.978]  And they don't really talk about what that means to the American people.
[00:10:58.988 --> 00:11:01.149]  They talk about how it will affect markets.
[00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:04.970]  They're talking about it like it's no big deal and not a bad thing.
[00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:07.471]  And they don't really talk about what's going to be replacing it.
[00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:20.436]  Well, the global SDR Bancorp digital currency that the private Ponzi scheme operating banking families will now have backed up by our tax money and the global carbon tax.
[00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:21.217]  So that's coming up.
[00:11:22.337 --> 00:11:27.618]  Here is another report mirroring the statements in the Wall Street Journal from Time Magazine.
[00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:30.319]  Are America's best days behind us?
[00:11:31.059 --> 00:11:33.539]  That calls up a line from Merle Haggard.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.320]  I wish your buck was still silver.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.601]  It was back when the country was strong.
[00:11:41.121 --> 00:11:44.942]  Back before Elvis and the Vietnam War came along.
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.721]  For the Beatles and yesterday.
[00:11:48.462 --> 00:11:50.503]  So they're telling us America is done.
[00:11:50.563 --> 00:11:51.204]  It's a lie.
[00:11:51.624 --> 00:12:03.013]  We could end this globalist dictatorship any time we wake up and recognize that globalism has de-industrialized this country, that globalism has been a cancer on our republic.
[00:12:03.414 --> 00:12:09.498]  Continuing with the currency issues, Reuters reports China's aim is to settle nationwide trade.
[00:12:10.499 --> 00:12:11.040]  I think?
[00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:27.678]  And so we won't have any industry left.
[00:12:27.698 --> 00:12:29.820]  We won't have any relief and service left.
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.045]  All we'll have is propaganda that's generated out of the mainstream media in this country.
[00:12:35.305 --> 00:12:36.687]  That's discredited and worthless.
[00:12:37.427 --> 00:12:38.668]  No one wants to buy into that anymore.
[00:12:38.688 --> 00:12:39.429]  That's a good thing.
[00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.915]  The globalists have basically sucked us dry and used our name to run their operations and driven us into the dirt.
[00:12:46.796 --> 00:12:52.638]  But we can wake up and rebuke them and tell them, get out of our lives and stand up against them any day we want.
[00:12:53.198 --> 00:13:08.262]  Or we can continue to be diverted and distracted by the false left-right distractionary paradigm that the system is using so successfully still against the population of this country and the planet.
[00:13:08.622 --> 00:13:12.483]  But China aims to settle nationwide trade in yuan this year.
[00:13:13.426 --> 00:13:22.891]  So the move towards completely decoupling the dollar from world reserve currency status is now reaching a fever pace.
[00:13:23.671 --> 00:13:26.292]  Also, Bloomberg reports announced U.S.
[00:13:26.452 --> 00:13:30.374]  job cuts rose 20 percent from a year ago.
[00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:33.075]  And it says employers in the U.S.
[00:13:33.116 --> 00:13:35.737]  announced more job cuts in February than in the last month.
[00:13:36.986 --> 00:13:41.150]  Uh, of this same month last year, led by surge at government agencies.
[00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.655]  Planned firings increased 20% to 50,702 last month from February 2010.
[00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:56.742]  The first year-over-year gain since 2009, according to a report today from Chicago-based Challenger Gray and Christmas, Inc.
[00:13:57.122 --> 00:14:01.386]  Announcements at federal and state-level governments' offices almost tripled from last year.
[00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:12.444]  So, job cuts slowed from last year, but only because of government hiring.
[00:14:13.264 --> 00:14:14.825]  Only government is growing.
[00:14:16.426 --> 00:14:22.909]  Now, some local governments are actually cutting massively, and the police and sheriff's departments are openly stating, oh hey, guess what?
[00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.572]  We are now going to not really respond to crime.
[00:14:27.892 --> 00:14:30.974]  We're now just a revenue generation system.
[00:14:32.967 --> 00:14:34.088]  So employers in the U.S.
[00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:40.235]  announced more job cuts in February than the same month last year, led by a surge at government agencies.
[00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:44.600]  Very confusing article because it says they hired more, but they also let off more.
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.802]  Reading this, it's hard to even understand what they're saying.
[00:14:47.183 --> 00:14:54.291]  More job cuts at federal level are expected in the months ahead as pressure mounts to cut costs and rein in soaring national debt.
[00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.151]  Very strange article.
[00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.192]  I can't even understand what it's saying, really.
[00:15:01.913 --> 00:15:03.453]  Here's some interesting science news.
[00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:07.715]  Tractor beam is possible with lasers, says scientist.
[00:15:08.255 --> 00:15:14.838]  A laser can act as a tractor beam, drawing small objects back towards the laser source, scientists have said.
[00:15:14.878 --> 00:15:15.859]  That's BBC.
[00:15:16.619 --> 00:15:18.760]  Here's another interesting article in the science...
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:46.002]  uh... category and this is from space dot com air force x thirty seven b space plane launching on secret mission tomorrow it's second mission of course more than eighty percent of shuttle and overall nasa missions are secret and our military and most of it has nothing to do with defense it's about offensive weapon systems and it's about surveilling uh... people here in the united states just like it came out a few months ago
[00:15:46.903 --> 00:16:04.875]  Well, in January, that the US-slash-EU-German combine to launch, quote, global warming monitoring satellites had nothing to do with it, that it was all infrared systems to spy on the people of the West.
[00:16:05.435 --> 00:16:15.222]  And once they get your infrared signal on the ground, they can then tell who you are from space biometrically from the heat signature of your shoulders and the top of your head.
[00:16:16.206 --> 00:16:21.228]  Every time I talk about that, I get emails going, they can't see your face from space unless you're looking up.
[00:16:21.268 --> 00:16:22.188]  That's not what I just said.
[00:16:22.208 --> 00:16:26.569]  This is what Bob Woodward three years ago wrote about being the secret weapon in Iraq.
[00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:35.452]  They get a heat resonance scan off of you, off of a heat scanning camera, infrared camera on the street.
[00:16:36.473 --> 00:16:40.394]  They attach that then to your license plate to confirm your identity.
[00:16:41.858 --> 00:16:54.547]  They can also run it through a face scan that the camera also runs, then connect that face scan and sync it up for ID purposes with the heat resonance scan and then track you by space everywhere you go.
[00:16:55.348 --> 00:16:59.130]  Okay, continuing along those lines.
[00:16:59.931 --> 00:17:04.174]  We're going to get more into that later in the broadcast today.
[00:17:05.796 --> 00:17:12.662]  But I do want to continue where we left off yesterday before I had to bail out because of a little stomach bug that developed while I was on air.
[00:17:13.623 --> 00:17:16.606]  Certainly couldn't be here vomiting live.
[00:17:16.626 --> 00:17:19.369]  I'm always vomiting out information.
[00:17:20.009 --> 00:17:22.712]  Pun intended, but had to bail out yesterday.
[00:17:22.732 --> 00:17:23.392]  So I want to
[00:17:24.468 --> 00:17:26.690]  Come back where we left off with your phone calls.
[00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:29.933]  We'll be taking your phone calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:17:30.334 --> 00:17:31.895]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:32.015]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:17:32.035 --> 00:17:38.521]  And I'd love to hear from folks if you can get through from the Middle East on what you're seeing happen there, Saudi Arabia, Yemen.
[00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:54.055]  Egypt, Libya, of course they've cut most of the phone lines there.
[00:17:54.075 --> 00:17:54.275]  800-259-9031.
[00:17:54.675 --> 00:18:01.320]  What do you think of these open announcements of ending the dollar as the world reserve currency?
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.643]  I mean, now it's not a question of if, but when.
[00:18:05.143 --> 00:18:06.484]  What are you doing to get prepared?
[00:18:06.564 --> 00:18:07.685]  Are you warning other people?
[00:18:07.725 --> 00:18:09.247]  Are your neighbors concerned about this?
[00:18:09.767 --> 00:18:14.511]  Or are they only concerned with Justin Bieber, the Charlie Sheen scandal?
[00:18:15.351 --> 00:18:22.880]  Uh, and all the rest of the things that are happening that the media, uh, basically uses as a distraction and an overall, uh, diversion.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:30.969]  And if you're saying, well, Alex, you're being a hypocrite, you always criticize all this obsession with Hollywood and stuff, but then you triggered all of this with Charlie last week.
[00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.991]  Uh, I was, wasn't expecting that.
[00:18:33.732 --> 00:18:40.364]  But if we can use all of this hype to get people to look at real information, which is happening, then God turns it into something good.
[00:18:41.226 --> 00:18:45.434]  Charlie's just my friend who has changed a lot after his seven-month jag.
[00:18:46.830 --> 00:19:11.630]  uh... that he was on and now is completely clean but a bit manic because of all the endorphins and the energy and I just hope he stays clean and comes through this unscathed because I know he's a good man who had a lot of courage uh... to come out for 9-11 truth and when I've known him he's been a very calm focused researching person uh... right now he's kind of going through a wild thing phase and he without sin let him cast the first
[00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:23.693]  Stone and as I mentioned in the first little five-minute segment coming up at the bottom of the last hour coming up in about two hours and 15 minutes from now I will say a little bit about Charlie.
[00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:25.773]  I had about an hour and a half discussion with him.
[00:19:25.793 --> 00:19:33.115]  We've been talking every day since last week but I had a long hour and a half discussion and really know a lot of the things behind the scenes that are going on.
[00:19:33.455 --> 00:19:39.577]  I'm not going to get into any of that because that's private but I can talk about a few things that are public and I can tell you what's real or what isn't.
[00:19:40.217 --> 00:19:41.539]  Uh, out there.
[00:19:41.719 --> 00:19:43.541]  Obviously, a lot of folks are asking us about that.
[00:19:44.062 --> 00:19:46.385]  And it is now bound to this show and what we're doing.
[00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:50.150]  Uh, and so, uh, I think it is proper to talk a little bit about it.
[00:19:51.071 --> 00:19:54.615]  Also, Howard Stern has been attacking me almost on a daily basis.
[00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.279]  And people are like, well, why are you talking about Howard Stern?
[00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:58.901]  Well, now his listeners are learning about this show.
[00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:02.839]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:03.960]  No kidding!

[00:20:43.371 --> 00:20:44.312]  The original since 1976.
[00:21:00.376 --> 00:21:02.719]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:04.961]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:05.081 --> 00:21:08.265]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:08.305 --> 00:21:13.051]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.411 --> 00:21:17.596]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.896 --> 00:21:20.260]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.784]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.804 --> 00:21:25.728]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:26.068 --> 00:21:33.680]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.996 --> 00:21:39.240]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:41.662]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.702 --> 00:21:45.665]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:46.826]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:47.006 --> 00:21:48.287]  You're everyone else.

[00:22:30.283 --> 00:22:34.666]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:34.846 --> 00:22:40.550]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:44.072]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:31.794]  After I take phone calls, I'm going to get back into why the dollar's reign is near an end here in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:24:33.095 --> 00:24:39.342]  Time Magazine coming out and saying, are America's good days behind us now?
[00:24:40.507 --> 00:24:42.988]  Why are they now admitting what they're doing?
[00:24:43.068 --> 00:25:03.459]  I want to go over their whole plan, why they're doing this, and hopefully talk to you, the listeners, about rallying the population of this country around the fact that the private Federal Reserve is completely criminal and is predatory and is the main author of this designed implosion that is now taking place.
[00:25:03.479 --> 00:25:04.880]  This is such a big deal.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.442]  Now, in a separate issue,
[00:25:09.798 --> 00:25:12.419]  I mentioned earlier, Howard Stern's been putting tweets out.
[00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:15.620]  I don't listen to his show very often, even though I have it on XM.
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:21.022]  I haven't heard it myself, but Jason Burmas and others have heard it and told us about it.
[00:25:21.542 --> 00:25:24.443]  He's doing silly things like saying I've got a bad toupee.
[00:25:25.243 --> 00:25:26.744]  If it was a toupee, it would be bad.
[00:25:27.104 --> 00:25:28.464]  No, this is my hair, folks.
[00:25:28.524 --> 00:25:30.085]  It's falling out, and I don't care.
[00:25:31.205 --> 00:25:33.767]  But there's no toupee on earth looks like this.
[00:25:34.328 --> 00:25:35.008]  This is my hair.
[00:25:35.268 --> 00:25:43.054]  But it just shows the infantile nature of what America is basically fed through people like Howard Stern.
[00:25:43.675 --> 00:25:49.099]  He said, never heard of Alex Jones, but listening to Charlie's interview, I'm pretty sure Alex is wackier than Charlie.
[00:25:49.219 --> 00:25:49.860]  Outstanding.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.001]  He tweeted that.
[00:25:51.481 --> 00:25:59.147]  He also put out in a tweet, last year, Jones predicted a coming race war in America to be brought on by the release of Robert Rodriguez's machete.
[00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:00.108]  It didn't happen.
[00:26:00.888 --> 00:26:03.169]  And that's the kind of things that he's putting out.
[00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:05.631]  Really, it didn't happen.
[00:26:06.251 --> 00:26:08.392]  Westlake Unrest dubbed L.A.
[00:26:08.452 --> 00:26:12.475]  machete riots by Immigration Restriction Group.
[00:26:13.235 --> 00:26:22.541]  And a lot of publications did report, and there was a Google map of it, six different riots, including multiple events with men wielding machetes.
[00:26:22.621 --> 00:26:28.064]  One of them had to be shot and killed by police the weekend that it was released.
[00:26:29.639 --> 00:26:39.267]  What I said was, if Robert Rodriguez didn't cut some of the things he had in that film out, it could cause racial tension that could lead to a race war.
[00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:47.273]  We've already seen the illegal aliens pulling down American flags in Texas, Arizona, in Florida, and in California.
[00:26:47.413 --> 00:26:51.276]  If kids wear American flags to school, that's MSNBC Associated Press,
[00:26:51.997 --> 00:27:01.264]  They're told take them off because it enrages the illegal aliens so much who are wearing their Mexican flags and taking down the school's flag and running up the Mexican flag.
[00:27:01.644 --> 00:27:05.187]  You know, my issue is Mexico is a country that lost wars with us.
[00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:20.778]  Mexico teaches its school children that the Southwest was wrongfully taken in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and that if the people coming here wanted to get into liberty and the Second Amendment and free speech, I'd be all for it.
[00:27:21.826 --> 00:27:22.888]  But they don't.
[00:27:22.968 --> 00:27:26.974]  They come from a country that has an incredible history of tyranny and corruption.
[00:27:27.355 --> 00:27:28.397]  And no one can deny that.
[00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:33.946]  And Rodriguez came out in the press, in the Austin American-Statesman, and ain't it cool news?
[00:27:34.972 --> 00:27:41.296]  And said that I wasn't telling the truth, that I didn't have the script, even though I got it directly from inside his operation.
[00:27:41.676 --> 00:27:48.881]  When the movie came out, it was word for word the script, except for two or three scenes they cut that were the scenes we recommended they cut.
[00:27:49.241 --> 00:27:55.245]  But it was still all about a race war, and it was the equivalent of a Hispanic birth of a nation.
[00:27:55.965 --> 00:27:58.868]  Of course, that was the Ku Klux Klan movie promoting race war.
[00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:06.256]  So, I was proven right, but the media, you know, says there's no world government forming as it's forming.
[00:28:07.096 --> 00:28:09.537]  They say fluoride in the water isn't bad for you.
[00:28:09.817 --> 00:28:11.978]  They say flu shots aren't bad for you and that we're wrong.
[00:28:12.058 --> 00:28:13.418]  No, we're right.
[00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:23.862]  And so the film did cause, was linked to some rioting and someone being shot who was wielding a machete.
[00:28:24.523 --> 00:28:27.424]  There's no doubt that that's basically what happened here.
[00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:30.445]  But my point was, we had the script and he said we didn't.
[00:28:30.925 --> 00:28:32.085]  And said that we were making stuff up.
[00:28:32.466 --> 00:28:37.467]  Later, he told Ain't It Cool News, yeah, I may have had too much tequila when I wrote the script.
[00:28:38.208 --> 00:28:39.328]  So he contradicted himself.
[00:28:39.768 --> 00:28:42.729]  And I am going to cut some scenes that will only be on the DVD.
[00:28:43.109 --> 00:28:44.050]  I went a little too far.
[00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:46.518]  So we told the truth.
[00:28:47.118 --> 00:28:49.500]  They cut the really incendiary stuff out.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:53.222]  I mean, they had the gringos crucifying the Catholic priest.
[00:28:53.262 --> 00:29:02.728]  They had the cowboy hat wearing rednecks, Robert De Niro and Don Johnson, little Hispanic women who are pregnant, begging, don't kill my baby.
[00:29:02.968 --> 00:29:06.190]  And then they shoot the woman in the stomach who's pregnant and make fun of it.
[00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:09.391]  You know, dead babies and Hispanics.
[00:29:09.792 --> 00:29:12.493]  I mean, it was total race-baiting division.
[00:29:13.013 --> 00:29:15.034]  Because the globalists don't want us coming together.
[00:29:15.855 --> 00:29:19.356]  Liberal, conservative, black, white, Hispanic against the TSA.
[00:29:19.696 --> 00:29:21.137]  Against the warrantless wiretapping.
[00:29:21.417 --> 00:29:22.518]  Against the illegal wars.
[00:29:23.058 --> 00:29:25.119]  They don't want us coming together against the New World Order.
[00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:31.181]  The Ford Foundation that funds the big universities and all this racial division and liberation theology wants this.
[00:29:31.582 --> 00:29:33.082]  And that's what happened with Rodriguez.
[00:29:33.582 --> 00:29:35.163]  And I know people that know him here in town.
[00:29:35.243 --> 00:29:36.624]  He's into La Reconquista.
[00:29:37.564 --> 00:29:41.466]  I was told he didn't like me a decade ago when his wife gave him my films.
[00:29:41.486 --> 00:29:43.506]  He said, well, that guy's not for my La Raza.
[00:29:44.107 --> 00:29:45.527]  And so it is what it is.
[00:29:45.707 --> 00:29:46.348]  And I'm right.
[00:29:46.768 --> 00:29:48.028]  And Howard Stern is wrong.
[00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:49.189]  But I mean, give me a break.
[00:29:50.663 --> 00:29:53.664]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.585 --> 00:29:57.366]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.407 --> 00:30:02.028]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:30:53.753 --> 00:30:54.213]  Thank you!
[00:30:59.926 --> 00:31:04.169]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:04.749]  Number 1.
[00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:08.551]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.811 --> 00:31:09.372]  Number 2.
[00:31:09.672 --> 00:31:14.235]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.575 --> 00:31:15.015]  It's true.
[00:31:15.315 --> 00:31:19.878]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:20.739]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.019 --> 00:31:24.301]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.601 --> 00:31:28.323]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.504 --> 00:31:28.764]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:31.666]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.067 --> 00:31:35.450]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:35.951]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.531 --> 00:31:40.455]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.675 --> 00:31:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.742]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.882 --> 00:31:51.463]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:51.683 --> 00:31:53.765]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:31:53.925 --> 00:31:56.266]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.344]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:32:03.624 --> 00:32:04.705]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:32:04.925 --> 00:32:09.110]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:14.976]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:32:15.257 --> 00:32:17.239]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:32:17.419 --> 00:32:20.102]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:32:20.442 --> 00:32:26.745]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:32:26.925 --> 00:32:28.746]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:34.208]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:32:34.488 --> 00:32:39.470]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:44.973]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[00:32:45.133 --> 00:32:48.074]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:51.215]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:32:51.235 --> 00:32:52.076]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:52.156 --> 00:32:54.717]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:15.718 --> 00:33:19.699]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:30.220]  This broadcast focuses on reality, what's happening in the world today.
[00:33:30.301 --> 00:33:37.802]  It's about not being a spectator who just accepts whatever is handed to them by the media and the government and the culture controllers.
[00:33:38.302 --> 00:33:44.443]  It's about the people getting involved fundamentally in understanding the dynamics that govern our planet.
[00:33:45.303 --> 00:33:51.408]  And trying to control our own destinies instead of handing our destiny over to others.
[00:33:51.849 --> 00:33:53.350]  It's about truly living.
[00:33:53.911 --> 00:33:56.233]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:33:56.293 --> 00:33:58.675]  Again, we're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:33:58.715 --> 00:33:59.155]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:59.175 --> 00:34:02.858]  Central, back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:03.419 --> 00:34:04.960]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:05.761]  Okay.
[00:34:07.328 --> 00:34:15.193]  The big news here, obviously, is that the situation is continuing to deteriorate in the Middle East and North Africa.
[00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:19.695]  And our inside sources called it, this was going to happen five months ago.
[00:34:21.056 --> 00:34:28.640]  We also have incredible announcements from the Wall Street Journal, why the dollar's reign is near an end.
[00:34:29.621 --> 00:34:36.065]  And they basically announced this situation and this earth-shattering development like it's no big deal.
[00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:41.621]  This will cause massive dollar devaluation.
[00:34:41.801 --> 00:34:50.386]  It will cause the dollar and the countries that hold trillions of dollars, like China, the Middle East, in the aggregate holds trillions.
[00:34:50.887 --> 00:34:52.768]  The European Union holds close to a trillion.
[00:34:53.068 --> 00:34:55.970]  It will cause those holdings to lose value.
[00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:01.216]  It will cause the value of the dollar to plunge, triggering massive inflation.
[00:35:01.657 --> 00:35:09.567]  It will decimate people on fixed incomes like Social Security, or people working near the poverty line, the working poor.
[00:35:10.689 --> 00:35:14.054]  All our country had left was the dollar.
[00:35:15.202 --> 00:35:20.447]  The industry's been shut down by the regulations and control and by the deals that have been signed with China.
[00:35:21.047 --> 00:35:22.849]  Globalism is a disease.
[00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:28.294]  It is a cancer designed to create a race to the bottom, a giant sucking sound.
[00:35:28.674 --> 00:35:31.737]  Remember 16, 17 years ago in 1994?
[00:35:32.838 --> 00:35:37.222]  We have clips of it in my film Fall of the Republic, whenever
[00:35:39.232 --> 00:35:48.148]  Ross Perot went on television and said this will drop wages, this will de-industrialize, this will hurt this country.
[00:35:49.042 --> 00:35:51.484]  He said, the next few decades it will destroy us.
[00:35:51.904 --> 00:35:53.825]  And the media laughed at him.
[00:35:54.205 --> 00:35:58.328]  And Al Gore got up there and said, this is a great deal, Larry.
[00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:01.530]  You need to be quiet, Ross Perot, and kept interrupting him.
[00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:04.812]  Oh, this is such a good deal.
[00:36:05.192 --> 00:36:07.934]  And you could just look at him and know from history he was lying.
[00:36:08.254 --> 00:36:11.256]  But also, not just intellectually, just watching him.
[00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.778]  He was enjoying conning people.
[00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:24.501]  And then he got together a few years later in 96 with Ken Lay at the White House with Enron and wrote up the carbon tax plan that we're now under.
[00:36:26.175 --> 00:36:35.761]  I mean, Al Gore is a criminal, is a treacherous, traitorous gangster setting up scams to make you and your family poor and consolidate wealth.
[00:36:36.141 --> 00:36:37.642]  They want a post-industrial America.
[00:36:38.022 --> 00:36:39.563]  This is their goal.
[00:36:40.324 --> 00:36:41.464]  I want to know what you think about it.
[00:36:41.484 --> 00:36:41.825]  800-259-9231.
[00:36:41.845 --> 00:36:43.646]  Just briefly getting back to Machete.
[00:36:49.085 --> 00:36:57.553]  In Hollywood Reporter, they basically kicked off this narrative a few days ago, the man behind Charlie Sheen's rants meets syndicated radio host Alex Jones.
[00:36:59.214 --> 00:37:09.143]  And at the end of the article, as a way to discredit me, they say, last year Jones predicted a coming race war in America to be brought on by the release of Robert Rodriguez's machete.
[00:37:09.523 --> 00:37:10.124]  It didn't happen.
[00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:21.224]  Really, major newspapers reported on the six riots that happened in the two days after Machete was released in Southern California.
[00:37:22.145 --> 00:37:28.387]  In every case, knife and machete wielding people, including one person, having to be gunned down by police.
[00:37:29.487 --> 00:37:39.751]  And at the very same time, in the videos that they linked to in Hollywood Reporter to discredit me, I talked about beheadings happening in Arizona by the drug cartels.
[00:37:41.405 --> 00:37:46.847]  And how the script for Machete talked about ongoing beheadings with machetes.
[00:37:48.687 --> 00:37:51.328]  And I said this was certainly going to encourage this and increase it.
[00:37:52.448 --> 00:38:09.013]  Then when the movie came out, and there were a bunch of beheadings in California, in Arizona, and in South Texas, I was reading these out of major newspapers and watching it on local TV in different areas of the country, Arizona, Texas, California, a few other areas.
[00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.161]  And it was Mexican drug gangs chopping people's heads off.
[00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:17.282]  And there were news articles that came out at the time saying, Jones is lying.
[00:38:17.622 --> 00:38:20.022]  There's no beheadings going on.
[00:38:20.622 --> 00:38:21.343]  With machetes.
[00:38:22.443 --> 00:38:23.203]  I was like, excuse me?
[00:38:23.223 --> 00:38:24.443]  I have all the mainstream articles.
[00:38:25.104 --> 00:38:26.944]  They were counting on you being stupid.
[00:38:27.984 --> 00:38:31.085]  They were counting on you not going and researching and looking it up.
[00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:35.769]  So, they're always announcing that we're wrong.
[00:38:35.789 --> 00:38:41.770]  They're always announcing that we've told people things that weren't true, twisting what we said.
[00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:50.192]  I said if he didn't cut the particularly race war invocations out of the film, that there was a very good chance it was going to trigger it.
[00:38:50.412 --> 00:38:51.812]  He did cut some of it out.
[00:38:52.432 --> 00:38:53.652]  But I had the exact script.
[00:38:53.772 --> 00:38:54.953]  I knew what areas were cut out.
[00:38:55.273 --> 00:38:57.053]  It was word for word, the exact script.
[00:38:57.313 --> 00:38:58.894]  They lied and said I didn't have the script.
[00:38:59.214 --> 00:39:00.354]  Well, I knew I had the script.
[00:39:01.371 --> 00:39:05.896]  It came from a major Hollywood manager.
[00:39:07.818 --> 00:39:10.421]  It also came out of an Austin office.
[00:39:10.441 --> 00:39:11.542]  I'm not going to say whose office.
[00:39:11.562 --> 00:39:12.283]  I think you can guess.
[00:39:13.123 --> 00:39:14.245]  Where's Rodriguez based?
[00:39:14.545 --> 00:39:20.311]  And then I also was sent a different version, but only slightly, of a rewrite from someone anonymously.
[00:39:22.413 --> 00:39:22.533]  Now,
[00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:27.941]  That said, every week or so, I see new beheading stories.
[00:39:28.561 --> 00:39:30.023]  Here's one today.
[00:39:30.624 --> 00:39:31.045]  Police.
[00:39:31.205 --> 00:39:34.149]  Arizona beheading tied to Mexican drug cartel.
[00:39:35.090 --> 00:39:36.391]  And this is Thursday, March 3rd, 2011.
[00:39:36.432 --> 00:39:37.273]  This is today.
[00:39:39.835 --> 00:39:42.878]  And sometimes I see these multiple times a week.
[00:39:42.918 --> 00:39:43.938]  Sometimes it takes a few weeks.
[00:39:44.379 --> 00:39:47.821]  And when I say I see it every week, I mean that's about how often I see it.
[00:39:48.062 --> 00:39:49.243]  You may be seeing it more often.
[00:39:50.063 --> 00:40:00.712]  But authorities have determined a man who was stabbed and beheaded in a suburban Phoenix apartment was killed for stealing drugs from a Mexican cartel in a gruesome example of drug cartel violence spilling over the border.
[00:40:02.319 --> 00:40:08.063]  And he reportedly stole 400 pounds of marijuana and meth from a drug cartel, and got his head chopped off.
[00:40:08.283 --> 00:40:09.384]  So there's... Oh, oh!
[00:40:09.824 --> 00:40:14.948]  By the way, it wasn't just me who got attacked, and they said I was making up beheadings all over the U.S.
[00:40:15.448 --> 00:40:22.794]  The governor, when I talked about this on video, it got picked up in the news, the governor talked about beheadings in Arizona.
[00:40:24.495 --> 00:40:29.959]  Particularly when the coyotes catch people that didn't pay them to cross, they chop their heads off.
[00:40:31.237 --> 00:40:35.522]  They found whole groups of people in Arizona for years with their heads chopped off.
[00:40:36.943 --> 00:40:39.386]  Women raped, and then they have their heads chopped off.
[00:40:39.686 --> 00:40:41.328]  Children having their heads chopped off.
[00:40:42.269 --> 00:40:50.998]  They find whole barns on the Mexican border with the U.S., in one case just a few months ago, with hundreds of dead, chopped up and shot.
[00:40:52.108 --> 00:40:55.469]  And what did the so-called liberal media do?
[00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.991]  They just came out and said, there's no heads being chopped off.
[00:40:59.571 --> 00:41:01.332]  The Arizona governor is a liar.
[00:41:01.692 --> 00:41:02.752]  Okay, she's a liar.
[00:41:03.013 --> 00:41:03.333]  All right.
[00:41:03.973 --> 00:41:06.274]  Here is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
[00:41:07.034 --> 00:41:08.715]  They just reposted the Associated Press.
[00:41:08.755 --> 00:41:09.335]  It'll be technical.
[00:41:09.695 --> 00:41:11.936]  It's AP Amanda Lee Myers.
[00:41:12.557 --> 00:41:12.937]  Today.
[00:41:13.797 --> 00:41:14.397]  Another beheading.
[00:41:14.837 --> 00:41:15.478]  Doesn't exist.
[00:41:15.638 --> 00:41:15.898]  Okay.
[00:41:18.189 --> 00:41:32.898]  Now, speaking of that whole area of discussion, heads of U.S.-Mexico to meet as tensions rise, and they go on to report that Obama is discussing putting armed U.S.
[00:41:33.098 --> 00:41:34.339]  agents in Mexico.
[00:41:35.499 --> 00:41:38.481]  Guys, that was in my stack, but now I can't find it.
[00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:39.462]  Will you put it on screen?
[00:41:39.542 --> 00:41:41.142]  Obama discussing putting armed U.S.
[00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:42.463]  agents in Mexico.
[00:41:42.503 --> 00:41:42.843]  Thank you.
[00:41:44.044 --> 00:41:46.986]  Which is a horrible, horrible, horrible idea.
[00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:53.639]  Uh, they have had, now in the last two years, over 30,000 Mexicans killed in the drug war.
[00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.585]  Thousands of them are government officials and police and military.
[00:41:59.607 --> 00:42:03.111]  I mean, in one week they killed, a few months ago, what was it, four mayors?
[00:42:04.473 --> 00:42:06.675]  Shot three of them, chopped the head off of another?
[00:42:07.762 --> 00:42:09.003]  Three or four or five.
[00:42:09.403 --> 00:42:10.123]  I can't even remember.
[00:42:10.143 --> 00:42:11.524]  I think it was, maybe it was five.
[00:42:12.205 --> 00:42:12.645]  There it is.
[00:42:13.325 --> 00:42:14.006]  AFP.
[00:42:14.446 --> 00:42:16.487]  Obama to discuss armed U.S.
[00:42:16.567 --> 00:42:17.368]  agents in Mexico.
[00:42:17.388 --> 00:42:19.709]  The United States will discuss the idea of U.S.
[00:42:19.769 --> 00:42:23.812]  armed agents operating inside Mexico, which is being rocked by deadly drug violence.
[00:42:24.112 --> 00:42:28.294]  When President Barack Obama meets his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderon, a U.S.
[00:42:28.314 --> 00:42:32.197]  senior official said yesterday, Obama welcomes Calderon to the White House today.
[00:42:32.737 --> 00:42:34.338]  It's a top priority for the U.S.
[00:42:34.378 --> 00:42:41.300]  government to ensure the measures are being taken to protect our personnel, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:48.283]  Oh yeah, because we've had all those embassy workers shot, killed, stabbed, and beheaded.
[00:42:48.503 --> 00:42:49.563]  Oh, that's been happening too.
[00:42:50.023 --> 00:42:57.166]  But Howard Stern says it's not happening, so because he knows how to make flatulence jokes, it must be true.
[00:42:59.847 --> 00:43:01.429]  I mean, it's crazy.
[00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:10.017]  All these news articles I've seen since I exposed Machete almost a year ago now, or I don't know, nine, ten months ago, have been proven wrong.
[00:43:12.379 --> 00:43:14.801]  We've been proven right, but they don't care.
[00:43:14.841 --> 00:43:19.385]  They just declare that we've lost and hope that people aren't paying attention.
[00:43:19.646 --> 00:43:20.647]  They think you're stupid.
[00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:29.036]  Now continuing, heads of US-Mexico to meet as tensions rise, violence from drug war to top agenda as Calderon visits Obama today.
[00:43:29.136 --> 00:43:30.797]  Now, that's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:43:32.718 --> 00:43:45.648]  If they decriminalize cocaine and heroin and marijuana, which I'm not saying is good to use those things, in every study, in every European country that's done it, it doesn't mean you sell it to school kids.
[00:43:45.668 --> 00:43:46.689]  No, no.
[00:43:47.529 --> 00:43:48.290]  You control it.
[00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:53.197]  And on average, within about two years, drug use drops by half.
[00:43:53.678 --> 00:43:55.578]  It's no longer seen as sexy and cool.
[00:43:55.919 --> 00:43:57.539]  The money isn't involved in it.
[00:43:58.179 --> 00:44:03.181]  And so there aren't all the women and fast cars and mansions associated with it.
[00:44:03.482 --> 00:44:06.263]  Then young people can't be involved in it as a business.
[00:44:07.363 --> 00:44:19.048]  Addicts, crime always plunges again by around 50% on average, because if they can go to the corner clinic and get their heroin for free through a welfare program,
[00:44:20.408 --> 00:44:23.210]  Uh, and it's medical grade and they're given smaller amounts of it.
[00:44:23.930 --> 00:44:29.393]  Um, are they gonna break into your house and steal your jewelry and computer and if they happen to catch you there, kill you?
[00:44:29.413 --> 00:44:33.755]  Uh, because they need to, uh, get their fix by putting a needle in their arm?
[00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:40.633]  Is a crackhead gonna carjack you and your family because they gotta have crack?
[00:44:40.673 --> 00:44:49.439]  The crack zombies that we see running around on the streets of every major city with their hair falling out, looking like something out of Day of the Dead zombies.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:54.163]  I remember growing up in Dallas as a teenager and just seeing the crack zombies.
[00:44:54.523 --> 00:44:56.685]  I mean, you'd see people who
[00:44:58.154 --> 00:45:03.124]  You'd see white people with their hair all falling out who had like green skin, sores all over their face.
[00:45:03.445 --> 00:45:08.234]  You would see black people so, so near the edge of death that they were white.
[00:45:09.821 --> 00:45:15.087]  I mean, they looked like they were dead, like all the blood was out of them, with their hair falling out, no teeth.
[00:45:15.728 --> 00:45:26.261]  They come up to your car window, and a woman with no teeth, with drool running out of her mouth, and what looked like sores all over, who looked like she weighed about 80 pounds, would say, baby, let me in the car.
[00:45:26.582 --> 00:45:27.463]  I'll do all this for $5.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:35.582]  And then you hurriedly wait for the red light to change so you can speed away.
[00:45:36.283 --> 00:45:39.044]  That would all end if you decriminalized it.
[00:45:39.384 --> 00:45:43.866]  And the crime, and the murders, and the corruption, it's a fact.
[00:45:44.707 --> 00:45:45.527]  It's a fact.
[00:45:46.027 --> 00:45:48.549]  Oh, but we have the biggest drug war in the world.
[00:45:49.469 --> 00:45:52.411]  And our country roughly uses half of the illegal drugs in the world.
[00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:53.551]  What an incredible number.
[00:45:53.991 --> 00:45:55.192]  It corrupts the police.
[00:45:55.312 --> 00:45:56.753]  It corrupts the society.
[00:45:57.253 --> 00:45:58.754]  It corrupts our young people.
[00:45:58.834 --> 00:46:00.214]  It's seen as sexy and cool.
[00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:02.055]  Drugs aren't sexy.
[00:46:02.415 --> 00:46:03.716]  Drugs aren't cool.
[00:46:04.096 --> 00:46:04.917]  Don't use them.
[00:46:05.217 --> 00:46:05.877]  Don't take them.
[00:46:05.937 --> 00:46:07.298]  Don't ever start.
[00:46:07.658 --> 00:46:09.559]  Don't ever put that chewing tobacco in your mouth.
[00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:10.940]  Don't ever smoke a cigarette.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.221]  It'll take 30 years off your life.
[00:46:13.301 --> 00:46:13.961]  It's addictive.
[00:46:14.001 --> 00:46:14.701]  It's hard to beat.
[00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.443]  Don't ever take cocaine.
[00:46:17.523 --> 00:46:18.864]  Don't ever take opiates.
[00:46:19.984 --> 00:46:24.267]  If you have your back hurt in a car wreck, tough it out without painkillers.
[00:46:24.987 --> 00:46:27.089]  I'm telling you, you do not want to get addicted.
[00:46:33.292 --> 00:46:34.773]  There is so much going on.
[00:46:34.813 --> 00:46:36.514]  There is so much happening here.
[00:46:37.135 --> 00:46:40.637]  And so, let me give you the larger situation and then we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:46:41.097 --> 00:46:42.158]  And then come up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:46:42.218 --> 00:46:43.819]  Next hour we got popping in from
[00:46:45.356 --> 00:46:47.037]  Cairo, Egypt, Max Keiser.
[00:46:48.177 --> 00:47:00.804]  In the SPP documents that Judicial Watch student got, and I talk about these so much, just like I talk about Governor Ridge eight and a half years ago in a two hour C-Span I watched, saying you're going to have to have a TSA card to have a job.
[00:47:01.264 --> 00:47:03.525]  There's going to be TSA checkpoints on every road.
[00:47:04.185 --> 00:47:05.846]  Local police will be TSA.
[00:47:06.566 --> 00:47:07.487]  Homeland Security.
[00:47:10.117 --> 00:47:11.458]  DHS certified.
[00:47:12.018 --> 00:47:15.940]  Now, here we are almost nine years later and that's all being rolled out.
[00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.521]  It took them that long to get it ready.
[00:47:19.461 --> 00:47:30.246]  There are certain key globalist events that we either sue and get the documents or they go ahead and think nobody's watching and talk about it on C-SPAN that give you total blueprint.
[00:47:32.236 --> 00:47:33.797]  It's like getting the enemy battle plans.
[00:47:34.337 --> 00:47:48.167]  And so there are dozens and dozens and dozens of things I harp on because there's such key information, their manifestos, their blueprints, their battle plans, their programs.
[00:47:49.808 --> 00:47:55.632]  Now, Judicial Watch sued for over a year, got the 1996 Banff Canada SPP meetings.
[00:47:57.077 --> 00:48:08.382]  Nothing in the year and a half previous to that, when Bush signed the SPP secretly with Vicente Fox and also the Canadian Prime Minister in Waco, Texas, no one had ever gotten the info.
[00:48:08.422 --> 00:48:12.684]  It was a secret agreement, secret treaty, high treason on its face.
[00:48:12.764 --> 00:48:17.966]  Even World Net Daily's experts wrote that it's treason to have the President signing secret treaties.
[00:48:18.226 --> 00:48:19.106]  He doesn't even have that power.
[00:48:19.646 --> 00:48:20.747]  The Senate has to ratify it.
[00:48:21.616 --> 00:48:22.337]  But they don't care.
[00:48:22.757 --> 00:48:24.559]  They controlled the bureaucracy.
[00:48:24.939 --> 00:48:34.007]  Now, Judicial Watch was able to sue over and over again and got thousands of pages of it and published much of it at Judicial Watch website.
[00:48:34.027 --> 00:48:35.749]  In fact, I want to get Judicial Watch back on about that.
[00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:37.571]  And what did it say?
[00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:39.232]  They got it in 2007.
[00:48:39.572 --> 00:48:40.473]  I put it in the endgame.
[00:48:40.874 --> 00:48:43.256]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement covers the key areas.
[00:48:43.516 --> 00:48:44.197]  Shows the documents.
[00:48:45.765 --> 00:48:46.645]  They have the meeting.
[00:48:47.065 --> 00:48:50.246]  The first thing they say is this is integration of North America by stealth.
[00:48:50.727 --> 00:48:55.968]  This plan only can succeed with all of you keeping this secret, including members of the press.
[00:48:56.609 --> 00:48:57.469]  We have the minutes of it.
[00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.611]  It's linked on whatistheendgame.com in the bibliography on the website.
[00:49:04.872 --> 00:49:06.192]  This is so important, folks.
[00:49:06.232 --> 00:49:07.013]  Look at what we have.
[00:49:07.653 --> 00:49:09.273]  And they said, we're going to use crises.
[00:49:09.373 --> 00:49:11.954]  We're going to use biological threats like the flu.
[00:49:12.634 --> 00:49:14.195]  We're going to use economic collapse.
[00:49:15.155 --> 00:49:19.796]  And we're going to use the drug war as a pretext to use Mexican and Canadian troops in the U.S.
[00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:22.177]  and vice versa with both other countries.
[00:49:23.629 --> 00:49:24.850]  What was in the news last week?
[00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.732]  Oh, Obama signs North American security perimeter.
[00:49:28.892 --> 00:49:30.293]  That's in the SPP documents.
[00:49:30.713 --> 00:49:37.336]  From Alaska, as we say in Endgame, four years ago, from Alaska down to the Mexican border with Guatemala.
[00:49:38.757 --> 00:49:39.858]  You understand how key this is?
[00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:45.801]  They went on and said, we're going to use the drug war threat and the violence that will increase.
[00:49:46.361 --> 00:49:51.084]  They knew when they were about to put Calderon in to declare war on the drug cartels, they didn't control this would happen.
[00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:55.251]  They create the crisis, just like they start the revolutions in the Middle East.
[00:49:55.551 --> 00:49:57.772]  Doesn't mean they control them, they can start them.
[00:49:58.292 --> 00:50:03.054]  It's easy to set a house on fire, and then show up later saying you're the fire department.
[00:50:03.554 --> 00:50:04.595]  That's what the globalists do.
[00:50:05.455 --> 00:50:14.179]  And so they said, we're going to use the drug war crisis, the flu crisis, and the terror threat, and also economic threat, those four things, to do this.
[00:50:14.839 --> 00:50:16.560]  And what did you see in the Ottawa Citizen?
[00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:18.201]  Let's put it on screen, we come back from break if we can.
[00:50:21.596 --> 00:50:26.020]  Mexican and American troops to be used in Canada, vice versa.
[00:50:26.541 --> 00:50:28.402]  Foreign troops to be in each other's countries.
[00:50:29.243 --> 00:50:30.184]  I forget the exact headline.
[00:50:31.616 --> 00:50:33.718]  Well, that was already going on in drills.
[00:50:33.838 --> 00:50:36.660]  And people are like, oh, they're not going to have Canadian-Mexican troops here.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.521]  And I'm like, well, here's all the SPP documents.
[00:50:38.781 --> 00:50:39.802]  Here's drills they did.
[00:50:40.082 --> 00:50:40.563]  Got U.S.
[00:50:40.603 --> 00:50:42.745]  troops up there last year for the Olympics.
[00:50:43.225 --> 00:50:45.146]  Vice versa, here's NLE09.
[00:50:45.467 --> 00:50:46.908]  FEMA put this out in a press release.
[00:50:47.688 --> 00:50:48.869]  Now they just announced it.
[00:50:48.889 --> 00:50:59.677]  So they're using all this drug war stuff to not just merge the countries by stealth through the bureaucracies, but also now announce gun control in the U.S., harmonizing our laws in Mexico.
[00:51:00.478 --> 00:51:04.720]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.640]  Number one.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.101]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:09.941]  Number two.
[00:51:10.241 --> 00:51:14.783]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:51:15.123 --> 00:51:15.563]  It's true.
[00:51:15.863 --> 00:51:20.425]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:51:20.745 --> 00:51:21.285]  Number three.
[00:51:21.565 --> 00:51:24.847]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:51:25.147 --> 00:51:28.848]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:51:29.048 --> 00:51:29.609]  Number 4.
[00:51:29.849 --> 00:51:32.211]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:51:32.611 --> 00:51:35.994]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:51:36.294 --> 00:51:36.495]  Number 5.
[00:51:37.075 --> 00:51:40.998]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:51:41.239 --> 00:51:45.983]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:05.082]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:05.483 --> 00:52:08.485]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:13.508]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:13.528 --> 00:52:19.772]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:19.912 --> 00:52:22.134]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:22.694 --> 00:52:22.974]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:22.994 --> 00:52:23.415]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.495 --> 00:52:24.115]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.175 --> 00:52:25.436]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.456 --> 00:52:27.698]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.412]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.712 --> 00:52:48.496]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:52:48.857 --> 00:52:57.985]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.376 --> 00:53:04.837]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:54:05.364 --> 00:54:11.411]  So the Globalists told us in their own SPP documents that they didn't want us to see how things really work.
[00:54:12.608 --> 00:54:36.507]  And there were a little over a hundred corporate CEOs from all over the world at that Banff Canada three-day meeting, at that resort, shut down, basically a Bilderberg Group-type meeting, and they had big working groups, and the CEOs then gave orders to the heads of the federal bureaucracies of Canada, Mexico, and the U.S., and then you could see everything in that document then being implemented.
[00:54:37.468 --> 00:54:39.850]  By stealth, this is corporate government.
[00:54:40.839 --> 00:54:54.649]  And when I flew up to New York last week, Sunday, I was on the plane with a major banking CEO and he just basically tried to sell me on we need a corporate government running America.
[00:54:54.669 --> 00:54:56.951]  You mean the ones that create the derivatives and rob everybody?
[00:54:57.291 --> 00:54:58.512]  The ones that want to take our guns?
[00:54:58.552 --> 00:55:00.533]  The ones that are for one-child policies?
[00:55:00.553 --> 00:55:02.454]  You mean you guys should run things?
[00:55:05.216 --> 00:55:08.599]  It was almost like the speech Howard Beale gets that we played last week.
[00:55:10.384 --> 00:55:14.932]  When he says you've meddled with the tidal forges of nature, Mr. Beale, and you will atone!
[00:55:14.952 --> 00:55:16.775]  Am I getting through to you, Mr. Beale?
[00:55:20.442 --> 00:55:30.805]  And I'm watching their battle plan, I'm watching everything they do, and they're down there in Mexico trying to mop up drug cartels that they didn't control with the $500 billion coming into the U.S.
[00:55:30.825 --> 00:55:32.806]  They control most of them, and that's all this is.
[00:55:33.306 --> 00:55:47.091]  And now when it spills over here, they're going to use it, and the Attorney General is saying to try to ban assault weapons and restrict gun purchases to one at a time, all because they have a gun ban in Mexico and the people are living in a nightmare.
[00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:50.654]  And we have to basically harmonize our laws with Mexico.
[00:55:51.335 --> 00:55:51.895]  It's incredible.
[00:55:53.196 --> 00:55:55.459]  And it's all over the news today.
[00:55:56.019 --> 00:56:04.848]  The good news is, though, a whole bunch of states, including Texas, are mulling Arizona-style illegal immigration law.
[00:56:05.703 --> 00:56:13.107]  But I almost called Paul Watson this morning to have him write a blurb or an article saying, Texas mulls Mexican-style immigration law.
[00:56:13.627 --> 00:56:19.930]  It's always, how horrible, if somebody's here illegally and they get caught doing another crime, they might get deported.
[00:56:20.130 --> 00:56:20.870]  Oh, it's so terrible.
[00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:24.272]  Mexico has some of the most draconian immigration laws in the world.
[00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:26.200]  This is mainstream news.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:27.501]  Mexico admits it.
[00:56:27.801 --> 00:56:33.686]  They put people for at least a year in a forced labor camp if they're caught from Latin America coming into Mexico.
[00:56:33.946 --> 00:56:34.847]  I'm not saying do that.
[00:56:35.327 --> 00:56:36.848]  I'm just saying deport illegal aliens.
[00:56:37.369 --> 00:56:41.332]  Especially if they're running around waving their foreign countries' flags saying down with America.
[00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:43.366]  I mean, get out of here.
[00:56:43.506 --> 00:56:46.668]  You have to pledge that you want to be a U.S.
[00:56:46.708 --> 00:56:50.889]  citizen and that you'll follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution and take that oath to become a citizen.
[00:56:51.529 --> 00:56:52.090]  I don't have to.
[00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:52.810]  I was born here.
[00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:58.072]  But the point is, if you declare yourself as an America hater, get out of here.
[00:56:59.031 --> 00:57:04.639]  Okay, but this is all, oh my gosh, Texas might try to have an Arizona-style immigration law.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:08.225]  You mean not have sanctuary cities where the illegal aliens are above the law?
[00:57:08.565 --> 00:57:09.907]  Oh my goodness, that would be terrible.
[00:57:10.288 --> 00:57:14.073]  But the real headline should be here, Texas moles
[00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:17.133]  Mexican immigration law.
[00:57:17.313 --> 00:57:19.936]  But then it would say, well, not actually.
[00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:23.280]  We're not going to put people in forced labor camps and we'll have links to all that.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:27.405]  We're not going to beat them up and suck money out of them and treat them like Mexico does.
[00:57:27.545 --> 00:57:33.232]  No, Texas is mulling the moderate Arizona law.
[00:57:34.321 --> 00:57:41.009]  See, but that's how the media creates all this emotion and says, if you've got brown skin, you're going to get arrested and put in a camp.
[00:57:41.149 --> 00:57:42.390]  Oh, sure you are.
[00:57:42.951 --> 00:57:45.213]  What, half the country has brown skin?
[00:57:45.774 --> 00:57:48.557]  The white people are all out suntanning trying to have brown skin?
[00:57:49.594 --> 00:57:51.096]  I mean, nobody cares.
[00:57:51.677 --> 00:57:56.162]  The media hypes all this race stuff to create the division, and I'm sick of it.
[00:57:56.703 --> 00:58:02.890]  I don't care what color you are, if you believe in private property, family, the Second Amendment, and sovereignty of this country.
[00:58:03.330 --> 00:58:06.814]  If you sign on to the Bill of Rights and realize how good it is and love it, I'm your friend.
[00:58:07.515 --> 00:58:18.061]  But you get so freaked out by an American flag that you send American school children, including Hispanics, home because it's like a vampire seeing a cross when you see an American flag.
[00:58:18.221 --> 00:58:18.961]  Get out of here!
[00:58:19.402 --> 00:58:20.262]  You're seditious.
[00:58:20.662 --> 00:58:21.863]  You're an enemy of this country.
[00:58:22.283 --> 00:58:23.024]  You've declared it.
[00:58:23.524 --> 00:58:25.205]  You see America as an enemy flag.
[00:58:26.175 --> 00:58:26.475]  Good.
[00:58:26.755 --> 00:58:27.356]  Get out of here.
[00:58:27.376 --> 00:58:29.297]  I'm not going to sit here and lick your boots.
[00:58:29.717 --> 00:58:31.638]  And that's the Common Sense Analysis on that.
[00:58:32.078 --> 00:58:35.640]  We're going to be back in one minute with your phone calls and a ton of news.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:39.102]  And Max Keiser coming up in 30 minutes from Cairo, Egypt.
[00:58:43.365 --> 00:58:44.766]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:50.382 --> 00:58:51.523]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.543 --> 00:58:58.231]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.491 --> 00:59:00.774]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.034 --> 00:59:06.220]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:09.201]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.461 --> 00:59:11.562]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:11.762 --> 00:59:17.704]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.025 --> 00:59:21.226]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.386 --> 00:59:26.928]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.188 --> 00:59:28.489]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:29.989]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:32.670]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:34.211]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:59:34.471 --> 00:59:36.831]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.012 --> 00:59:41.492]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:41.632 --> 00:59:42.633]  That's End of America.
[00:59:42.753 --> 00:59:44.073]  The number 3.com.

[00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:55.155]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.615 --> 00:59:58.416]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.983 --> 01:00:09.186]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:10.627]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:12.369]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.949 --> 01:00:16.572]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.132 --> 01:00:21.256]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:30.282]  We are now into our number two.
[01:00:30.322 --> 01:00:31.664]  I've covered a host of key issues.
[01:00:31.724 --> 01:00:32.324]  I'll recap.
[01:00:32.784 --> 01:00:34.386]  Right now, we're going to be going to your phone calls.
[01:00:35.868 --> 01:00:38.190]  Let's talk to Patience in Kansas.
[01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:39.491]  You're on the air.
[01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:39.851]  Welcome.
[01:00:41.752 --> 01:00:42.333]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:42.573 --> 01:00:46.276]  You know, I was listening in on what you're talking about, that Arizona law.
[01:00:46.756 --> 01:00:47.897]  Remember when Obama
[01:00:48.672 --> 01:00:55.195]  Came out and he said that that sounded racist and that was such a horrible law and the way that they were going about it and he was standing up against it.
[01:00:55.795 --> 01:01:10.922]  I don't know what his problem is with that because when Operation Phoenix came out in San Bernardino and cops from Fontana were allowed into San Bernardino along with a lot of other official figures that shouldn't have been there.
[01:01:10.962 --> 01:01:14.504]  They went door-to-door collecting kids for CPS at four o'clock in the morning and stuff.
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:19.804]  These cops from Fontana were running around calling little children the N-word.
[01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:21.205]  Okay?
[01:01:21.606 --> 01:01:30.154]  And apparently, the mayor of that town, the founder of Operation Phoenix in San Bernardino, went and met with Joe Biden.
[01:01:31.112 --> 01:01:34.154]  Okay, and Joe Biden thinks that this Operation Phoenix thing is great for the government.
[01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:34.954]  Oh, no, no, no.
[01:01:34.974 --> 01:01:44.660]  When the police go door-to-door in Boston and New York and Chicago for knock-and-talk and demand to be let in to, quote, look for illegal guns without warrants, that's great.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:47.721]  When the government listens to you without warrants, that's great.
[01:01:48.202 --> 01:01:50.043]  When all of that's happening, it's wonderful.
[01:01:50.363 --> 01:01:58.107]  But, heaven forbid, if we've already arrested an illegal for committing a crime that, when we know they're illegal, we also charge them with that.
[01:01:58.327 --> 01:01:59.088]  Heaven forbid.
[01:02:00.626 --> 01:02:04.250]  Todd, I'm telling you, you combine that with SACWIS and we are in trouble.
[01:02:04.951 --> 01:02:07.433]  Seriously, I want to do a movie about SACWIS.
[01:02:07.473 --> 01:02:09.395]  Would you do a cameo in it, if I did?
[01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:10.637]  A movie about what?
[01:02:11.558 --> 01:02:14.741]  SACWIS, the State Automated Child Welfare Information System.
[01:02:14.801 --> 01:02:16.603]  I wrote the article for it, you put it on your site.
[01:02:16.874 --> 01:02:17.334]  No, I know.
[01:02:17.675 --> 01:02:18.996]  You called in last week about it.
[01:02:19.276 --> 01:02:29.743]  You know, I would love to make a million different movies, but for those that don't know, the state of California and others that's happening all over the country are creating basically licensing for children.
[01:02:29.763 --> 01:02:32.345]  I just think you should write more articles about it, and I wouldn't wait.
[01:02:32.385 --> 01:02:34.507]  I mean, just get up on YouTube yourself and talk about it.
[01:02:34.527 --> 01:02:40.772]  You know, folks always want to have some master stroke right up front, but it's best just to do what you can do now.
[01:02:40.852 --> 01:02:41.712]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:41.752 --> 01:02:42.693]  Good to hear from you, Patience.
[01:02:43.173 --> 01:02:44.314]  George in Washington.
[01:02:44.354 --> 01:02:45.175]  George, you're on the air.
[01:02:48.854 --> 01:02:51.194]  Sounds like you're calling in, George, on an electric shaver.
[01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:55.775]  Is that a Norelco?
[01:02:56.055 --> 01:02:56.795]  There, I just said it.
[01:02:57.115 --> 01:02:57.796]  Norelco.
[01:02:58.456 --> 01:02:59.636]  Oh, your phone's better now, George.
[01:02:59.656 --> 01:03:00.016]  Go ahead.
[01:03:00.036 --> 01:03:01.716]  Yeah, it's the Morphic Field of Residence.
[01:03:01.756 --> 01:03:04.077]  I got the grog that you got yesterday.
[01:03:04.097 --> 01:03:06.157]  I got it also, but I'm trying to fight through it.
[01:03:06.177 --> 01:03:10.018]  Okay, well, what's on your mind today, George?
[01:03:10.038 --> 01:03:11.018]  Oh, too much.
[01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:11.638]  You got an hour?
[01:03:14.379 --> 01:03:15.219]  What do you want to talk about?
[01:03:15.439 --> 01:03:16.899]  We could start... Okay, Bob Chapman.
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:17.940]  Hey Alex!
[01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:43.852]  Hey, what's up, man?
[01:03:44.092 --> 01:03:47.878]  I'm going to keep it short and sweet because I know what a blessing it is to have this time with you here, man.
[01:03:47.998 --> 01:03:49.380]  A couple of things.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:55.809]  One, just like you and Lindsey Williams like to say, they like to put it right in front of our face.
[01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:56.410]  You know what's going on.
[01:03:57.842 --> 01:03:59.984]  I'm not sure if you've ever heard of this, man, but the Illuminati card game.
[01:04:00.004 --> 01:04:00.524]  You ever heard of that?
[01:04:00.864 --> 01:04:01.565]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:04.106]  We've tried to get the inventor of it who lives here in Austin.
[01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:05.747]  What's his name?
[01:04:05.787 --> 01:04:06.608]  Something Jackson?
[01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:12.152]  He lives here in town and that came out like, what, almost 20 years ago?
[01:04:12.172 --> 01:04:14.593]  And it lays out the towers being blown up.
[01:04:14.974 --> 01:04:16.715]  It lays out the anthrax attack.
[01:04:16.795 --> 01:04:17.996]  I mean, it's uncanny.
[01:04:18.716 --> 01:04:21.318]  And I want to get him on to ask, how did you know all this?
[01:04:22.997 --> 01:04:24.958]  Also, man, Monster Energy Drink.
[01:04:25.298 --> 01:04:27.699]  You know, the Arabic 666, man.
[01:04:27.719 --> 01:04:29.280]  It's just everywhere, man.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.200]  This is a battle, man.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.101]  Good and evil, you know?
[01:04:32.701 --> 01:04:35.002]  And a couple other things, man.
[01:04:36.883 --> 01:04:38.963]  You, uh... Hold on one second here.
[01:04:39.784 --> 01:04:41.024]  Looking at my notes.
[01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:45.346]  Man, you are doing such good work for us, man.
[01:04:45.666 --> 01:04:47.947]  As a country, as people, man.
[01:04:49.099 --> 01:04:50.481]  I just wanted you to know that I'm praying for you.
[01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:53.686]  I'm sure that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people are praying for you, man.
[01:04:53.726 --> 01:04:56.150]  You got some superhuman strength, man.
[01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.493]  You got some crazy power behind you.
[01:04:58.814 --> 01:04:59.935]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:05.820]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:14.281]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:19.042]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:19.642 --> 01:05:30.464]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.084 --> 01:05:40.112]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:40.613 --> 01:05:45.657]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.038 --> 01:05:53.224]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:53.524 --> 01:05:56.287]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:01.443 --> 01:06:05.086]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:05.486 --> 01:06:08.468]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:08.709 --> 01:06:13.492]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:19.757]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:19.897 --> 01:06:22.139]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:22.959]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:23.419]  Bernanke?
[01:06:23.499 --> 01:06:24.120]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.380]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.681]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:41.587 --> 01:06:48.530]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:06:48.851 --> 01:06:57.975]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:59.963 --> 01:07:04.185]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.506 --> 01:07:05.106]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.406 --> 01:07:08.548]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.828 --> 01:07:09.388]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.688 --> 01:07:14.251]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.591 --> 01:07:15.031]  It's true.
[01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:19.894]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.214 --> 01:07:20.735]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.035 --> 01:07:24.317]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.617 --> 01:07:28.319]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.519 --> 01:07:29.060]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.682]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:35.446]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.767 --> 01:07:35.967]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.547 --> 01:07:40.472]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.692 --> 01:07:45.457]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.737 --> 01:07:49.758]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.459]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.699 --> 01:07:53.780]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:56.421]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:56.461 --> 01:07:57.641]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:57.661 --> 01:07:58.762]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:23.492]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:08:23.512 --> 01:08:24.753]  We're going right back to your calls.
[01:08:24.833 --> 01:08:32.318]  Max Keiser, TV presenter, a stock market expert, joining us from Cairo, Egypt, via video Skype in the room of his hotel.
[01:08:32.338 --> 01:08:35.960]  It's an amazing shot we've got for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.844]  If you're a member or radio listener, you'll obviously get the audio, and then the video later will be all over the web for everybody.
[01:08:42.544 --> 01:08:51.688]  Of course, the big news here, recapping it, why the dollar's reign is near an end, that is the Wall Street Journal saying the dollar will die in the near future.
[01:08:52.149 --> 01:08:54.790]  But they talk about, oh, it might cause a few market disruptions.
[01:08:54.910 --> 01:08:57.191]  Yeah, like people on fixed incomes being in deep trouble.
[01:08:57.571 --> 01:08:59.152]  Massive dollar devaluation.
[01:08:59.812 --> 01:09:00.213]  The U.S.
[01:09:00.253 --> 01:09:02.994]  won't be able to buy foreign goods cheaply anymore.
[01:09:03.574 --> 01:09:04.855]  This is the equivalent of
[01:09:06.354 --> 01:09:07.840]  A economic Armageddon.
[01:09:08.362 --> 01:09:11.635]  Now not on the horizon, but right down the street.
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.621]  And we're going to be going over that with Kaiser as well when he joins us.
[01:09:18.401 --> 01:09:26.763]  Also, I want to get into some of the other economic news that we are seeing here as well.
[01:09:26.803 --> 01:09:31.044]  Some of the new WikiLeaks information and huge new police state developments.
[01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:34.885]  But even Time Magazine says, are the good times over for America?
[01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:36.045]  That's one of the
[01:09:37.165 --> 01:09:39.887]  Other headlines that is out there.
[01:09:40.508 --> 01:09:42.830]  But right now, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:44.451]  Bill in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[01:09:45.372 --> 01:09:46.093]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:48.114]  I have just four quick bullet points.
[01:09:49.035 --> 01:09:51.918]  Number one, I don't know how anyone could question your credibility.
[01:09:52.758 --> 01:10:02.667]  When, on your program, when I began listening in October, when Lindsey William predicted the explosion, the Middle East exploding in exactly four months.
[01:10:03.888 --> 01:10:04.368]  Number two,
[01:10:06.044 --> 01:10:07.945]  You really shut those women down on The View.
[01:10:07.985 --> 01:10:13.667]  It's the first time that I've seen a guest come in and absolutely hammer the guest house.
[01:10:13.827 --> 01:10:15.567]  Oh, I can hammer anybody if it's live.
[01:10:15.647 --> 01:10:17.988]  I'd love to take down O'Reilly, but he's scared.
[01:10:18.968 --> 01:10:23.010]  Well, those women looked petrified when you were on, which was actually pretty funny.
[01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:35.654]  The third point, if you can talk to perhaps Ron Paul when he's on, you had made a cogent point about saying if the banks had paid all that money back, which they said they have,
[01:10:36.266 --> 01:10:40.033]  Wouldn't the debt be reduced by a commensurate amount?
[01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:44.000]  In other words, wouldn't it be down to 12 trillion instead of 14 trillion?
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:47.245]  Well, and that's only what's due now, and that's only federal.
[01:10:48.007 --> 01:10:49.049]  Look, here's what happened.
[01:10:50.054 --> 01:11:01.686]  They got three different, quote, bailouts that were really takeovers, and the media only focused on the $887 billion that the banks then got at zero interest and loaned out at $10, $20, $30.
[01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:10.616]  CNN reported, I didn't even know this, last month, in fact, let's pull it up for folks, they won't believe it, CNN.com, and then put in after it,
[01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:15.187]  Credit card rates now at 59.9.
[01:11:17.888 --> 01:11:35.320]  So, imagine, they get free money at zero, they loan it out at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, almost 60%, depending on who, as people go into debt, and then they paid some of that money back, but it wasn't talking about the open window, the Federal Reserve creating tens of trillions,
[01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:40.043]  Bloomberg reported over a year ago it was 23.7, then another four plus trillions, that's 28 trillion.
[01:11:40.523 --> 01:11:48.228]  They weren't counting all the secret loans or the secret money transfers to things like MSNBC and hundreds of other U.S.
[01:11:48.268 --> 01:11:48.928]  corporations.
[01:11:49.268 --> 01:11:51.430]  So the media did a strawman
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:53.691]  Or, or lying by omission.
[01:11:54.031 --> 01:12:15.527]  They only focused on one area, but that $887 billion, we now learned about a year after, so now two years into it, or three years into it total, but about a year into it, year and a half into it, we learned that, folks you can look all this up what I'm saying, this is fact, that, oh, that $887 billion was a revolving door of credit.
[01:12:15.807 --> 01:12:19.029]  They were doing it over and over again every few months.
[01:12:19.349 --> 01:12:19.650]  Now,
[01:12:21.109 --> 01:12:26.251]  You see the headlines a month ago out of Davos, Switzerland, at the Davos Public Bilderberg Group meeting.
[01:12:27.751 --> 01:12:29.532]  I'm sorry, let me apologize.
[01:12:29.552 --> 01:12:33.573]  I saw an earlier CNN that said 69.
[01:12:34.274 --> 01:12:37.915]  I'm sorry, my credit card had 79.9 APR.
[01:12:38.395 --> 01:12:40.876]  So, some people are getting 79.9.
[01:12:42.977 --> 01:12:44.497]  Loan sharking is 30%.
[01:12:44.937 --> 01:12:49.159]  But going back to Davos, we'll put that headline up, people won't believe it.
[01:12:50.373 --> 01:12:56.398]  Davos wants $100 trillion in additional liquidity.
[01:12:56.959 --> 01:13:11.151]  Now, they get $100 trillion backed by Western taxpayers, then they leverage it 1 to 10, so that's now $1 quadrillion, $1,000 trillion, and then they leverage it out again through different layer derivatives.
[01:13:11.531 --> 01:13:12.372]  The sky's the limit.
[01:13:12.652 --> 01:13:15.394]  So they're talking about thousands of trillions
[01:13:16.255 --> 01:13:21.919]  Publicly they're talking about a hundred trillion, and we're having debates about banks giving back loans of a few hundred billion.
[01:13:22.419 --> 01:13:23.740]  There's the London Telegraph headline.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.683]  World needs 100 trillion more credit, says World Economic Forum.
[01:13:28.143 --> 01:13:30.104]  Sorry, any other comments, sir?
[01:13:30.805 --> 01:13:32.366]  Well, just two more comments.
[01:13:32.786 --> 01:13:36.629]  But when you say 100 trillion, is that coming out of
[01:13:37.216 --> 01:13:38.617]  The American taxpayer's pocket?
[01:13:38.857 --> 01:13:39.398]  Absolutely.
[01:13:39.418 --> 01:13:40.579]  Do you want me to explain how it works?
[01:13:41.099 --> 01:13:41.839]  Yeah, I would.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:49.125]  Okay, they have all of the major Western nations, Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the EU, England, the U.S.
[01:13:50.246 --> 01:13:52.888]  We contribute the seed money.
[01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.209]  So say the U.S.
[01:13:55.229 --> 01:14:00.894]  pumps a hundred billion, and that's a public number, then we find out about hundreds of billions more in secret.
[01:14:01.594 --> 01:14:03.636]  They then leverage it
[01:14:04.758 --> 01:14:09.499]  But since 1999, they don't have Glass-Steagall anymore, so before they had the rule of about 1 to 10.
[01:14:09.859 --> 01:14:16.580]  For every $1 you put in the bank, the bank, not just the bigger Federal Reserve banks, can loan out $10 more.
[01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:16.960]  You put $1,000 in, $10,000.
[01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:17.440]  You put $1,000,000 in, $10,000,000.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.460]  You put $10,000,000 in, they can put out $100,000,000.
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.301]  You put $100,000,000 in, you see the math.
[01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:22.641]  But in 1999, the bankers always had the global rule of
[01:14:33.433 --> 01:14:34.834]  Eight dollars out for every dollar.
[01:14:34.914 --> 01:14:36.235]  Ten dollars out for every dollar.
[01:14:37.116 --> 01:14:37.896]  Nations varied.
[01:14:38.156 --> 01:14:41.039]  But they always knew that it caused hyperinflation if they went above that.
[01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:43.720]  Or it made the hyperinflation happen too fast.
[01:14:44.721 --> 01:14:51.306]  Any fractional system causes inflation overall, but time hides that inflation tax.
[01:14:51.966 --> 01:14:59.292]  Now they have layered debt structure derivatives that in some cases are over 60 layers deep.
[01:15:00.299 --> 01:15:02.200]  And all of it is counterfeit and fraud.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.481]  So, they're not leveraging it one to ten.
[01:15:04.781 --> 01:15:14.066]  They leverage it ten times, and then they leverage all of that dozens and dozens of times apiece, and then leverage the derivatives of that dozens and dozens of times apiece.
[01:15:14.507 --> 01:15:14.707]  So...
[01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:22.325]  Even mainstream media admits that it's somewhere around a hundred, excuse me, a thousand trillion in derivatives.
[01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:23.686]  That's the too big to fail.
[01:15:24.007 --> 01:15:26.890]  So they get us to bind our pension funds, our countries to that.
[01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:31.316]  It's impossible to pay back, but the public doesn't understand that.
[01:15:31.576 --> 01:15:36.162]  And so it's set up that as things get worse and worse, the bankers absorb everything through fraud.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.221]  And then they get bailed out when they go down.
[01:15:40.101 --> 01:15:43.842]  Or they just blow out a company like Enron, they've already moved the money out the door.
[01:15:44.082 --> 01:15:45.803]  Have you seen the movie Goodfellas?
[01:15:46.183 --> 01:15:58.188]  How they come in, take over the guy's bar and restaurant, never pay for any of the liquor, never pay for any of the veal or the chicken at the restaurant, never pay for insurance, nothing.
[01:15:58.728 --> 01:16:04.550]  And then, a year into this, after they've done nothing but profit, they burn the place down and get the insurance money.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:07.081]  So they burn Enron down.
[01:16:07.461 --> 01:16:12.604]  I told people two years before Enron imploded, it was a narcotics trafficking Ponzi scheme, from my inside sources in Houston.
[01:16:13.044 --> 01:16:16.906]  CNN was saying, invest in Enron, you know, it's the best, they're the smartest guys in the room.
[01:16:17.246 --> 01:16:23.249]  Meanwhile, it was a front, and I saw them moving all their money out to other shell corporations, and warned everybody.
[01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:31.694]  In essence, with this fractional banking, it's basically a Ponzi scheme, and Madoff was right.
[01:16:32.423 --> 01:16:34.644]  Yes, well, it's worse than a Ponzi scheme.
[01:16:34.684 --> 01:16:37.106]  I mean, a Ponzi scheme, the guy has to run at the end.
[01:16:37.646 --> 01:16:40.788]  In this Ponzi scheme, they call in the army and you bow down and lick their boots.
[01:16:41.288 --> 01:16:45.510]  And the public only knows about American Idol and Howard Stern, so they're just going, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:46.190]  See?
[01:16:47.371 --> 01:16:47.611]  Right.
[01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:49.252]  I mean, you know.
[01:16:50.112 --> 01:16:52.854]  No, anyway, yeah, it's just unbelievable.
[01:16:53.754 --> 01:16:54.875]  Just one last comment.
[01:16:56.056 --> 01:17:00.298]  I haven't heard you talk about Mark Phillips or Kathy O'Brien.
[01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:02.111]  Are you familiar with them?
[01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:07.035]  I know that they were... Yes, I met them once at an event in Austin, and I just can't document what they're saying.
[01:17:07.055 --> 01:17:09.758]  And I'm not saying it's true or not true.
[01:17:09.778 --> 01:17:11.800]  I just can't prove it, so I stay away from it.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:12.961]  All right.
[01:17:13.021 --> 01:17:14.362]  Well, that's the end of my comments.
[01:17:14.442 --> 01:17:14.662]  All right.
[01:17:14.682 --> 01:17:15.583]  Thank you so much, Bill.
[01:17:15.603 --> 01:17:16.304]  Appreciate that.
[01:17:16.624 --> 01:17:18.285]  Lauren in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:17:20.247 --> 01:17:20.527]  Hello?
[01:17:20.868 --> 01:17:21.048]  Hey!
[01:17:22.145 --> 01:17:23.587]  Alex, hey, good to talk to you.
[01:17:23.607 --> 01:17:31.018]  I just wanted to reference a couple articles on Prison Planet, the MLK article and the Divide and Conquer article.
[01:17:31.471 --> 01:17:36.492]  I just recently attended a union rally here in Minnesota where Keith Ellison spoke.
[01:17:36.893 --> 01:17:42.314]  He started talking about the Wizard of Oz and Dorothy looking behind the curtain and I just couldn't shut up.
[01:17:42.394 --> 01:17:44.675]  I said, I had to call him out.
[01:17:45.155 --> 01:17:46.455]  I said, follow the money.
[01:17:46.715 --> 01:17:52.857]  And then he started, he got all distracted and you can look it up on YouTube, Ellison at Minnesota Union Rally.
[01:17:53.297 --> 01:18:02.042]  And then he started talking about how back in 2000 we were fighting to defeat Bushism, we got two wars, Obama promised it.
[01:18:03.322 --> 01:18:06.024]  So I just want to say, who are the puppeteers?
[01:18:06.404 --> 01:18:15.589]  Just look up, and this is where people can print these articles, get them to their friends and family, bring the left and the right together, bring families together, bring the communities together.
[01:18:15.589 --> 01:18:16.129]  Exactly.
[01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:18.651]  It's not that some of the unions aren't corrupt and bad.
[01:18:18.712 --> 01:18:28.219]  The point is you could get rid of it all, you could fire all those people, and it wouldn't pay for one one billionth of the fake debt the bankers have created.
[01:18:28.299 --> 01:18:29.080]  It's a distraction.
[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:33.704]  The governor in New Jersey, the governor in Wisconsin, you know, they are scapegoating
[01:18:34.284 --> 01:18:36.086]  the the domesticated people
[01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:50.964]  Going after the banksters.
[01:18:51.304 --> 01:18:52.506]  We can debate stuff later.
[01:18:52.886 --> 01:18:54.448]  We can go after each other later.
[01:18:54.528 --> 01:18:55.710]  We can have debates about it.
[01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.772]  But we have to get our government back.
[01:18:58.053 --> 01:19:00.936]  Get rid of the COG, Continued Government Takeover grid.
[01:19:01.177 --> 01:19:02.819]  We've got to get rid of the private Federal Reserve.
[01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:07.164]  We've got to write off the 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives that we do not owe.
[01:19:07.805 --> 01:19:08.746]  I mean, look at Ireland.
[01:19:08.906 --> 01:19:18.611]  It's admitted in the Irish press, the head of their central bank says the Irish don't owe this money, it's the bankers' debts, but that it's going to be good to have, quote, foreign banks run Ireland.
[01:19:19.051 --> 01:19:21.492]  I mean, you cannot make up those quotes from two months ago.
[01:19:22.292 --> 01:19:23.653]  And same thing in Iceland.
[01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:26.615]  And it came out, the people didn't owe hardly any of it.
[01:19:26.895 --> 01:19:27.375]  It was less than 10%.
[01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.876]  It was all the globalist bankers.
[01:19:29.996 --> 01:19:31.317]  They did these deals.
[01:19:31.777 --> 01:19:32.958]  They set this up.
[01:19:33.938 --> 01:19:35.639]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:36.480]  Anything else?
[01:19:37.304 --> 01:19:38.385]  God bless InfoWars.
[01:19:38.405 --> 01:19:40.387]  This is where the American people can come together.
[01:19:40.427 --> 01:19:50.077]  Look at Charles Lindbergh Sr., the former representative from Minnesota who once ran for governor.
[01:19:50.137 --> 01:19:50.717]  Absolutely.
[01:19:50.978 --> 01:19:51.738]  God bless you, Loren.
[01:19:51.758 --> 01:19:52.659]  We're out of time.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.263]  You can get rid of everything, and it's rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.
[01:19:57.304 --> 01:19:57.664]  Okay?
[01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:58.906]  I mean, it's that simple.
[01:20:00.438 --> 01:20:06.661]  Don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation, bankrupted or being sued?
[01:20:07.021 --> 01:20:12.564]  Zero Debt has a program that stops foreclosure, guaranteed for at least two years, without payments or attorneys.

[01:20:23.249 --> 01:20:24.690]  Loan modification is a joke.
[01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:28.432]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.

[01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:37.050]  We're good.

[01:22:30.027 --> 01:22:31.108]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.268 --> 01:22:35.651]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:41.555]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.655 --> 01:22:45.057]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.297 --> 01:22:47.899]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.119 --> 01:22:52.922]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.063 --> 01:22:53.303]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.363 --> 01:22:54.704]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.227 --> 01:23:03.269]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:10.994]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take lots of quality supplements and in many instances only make minimal progress.
[01:23:11.495 --> 01:23:15.517]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[01:23:16.038 --> 01:23:17.098]  It is glutathione.
[01:23:17.499 --> 01:23:21.161]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:23:21.561 --> 01:23:24.924]  It stops free radicals, keeps cells young, and reduces inflammation.
[01:23:25.544 --> 01:23:30.849]  One World Whey Protein Powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64% or more.
[01:23:31.329 --> 01:23:38.055]  One World Whey is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:38.576 --> 01:23:43.400]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:23:45.001 --> 01:23:47.064]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[01:23:47.404 --> 01:23:47.664]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:23:47.684 --> 01:23:47.985]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:23:48.025 --> 01:23:49.086]  Or visit oneworldway.com.
[01:23:49.146 --> 01:23:50.167]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:08.872]  Announcing a new currency!
[01:24:09.032 --> 01:24:10.714]  Global SDRs!
[01:24:11.114 --> 01:24:13.116]  Run by the IMF and World Bank!
[01:24:13.216 --> 01:24:14.798]  Cobra Currency!
[01:24:17.761 --> 01:24:25.849]  Yeah, they're coming out with their new global cashless currency that all other currencies are going to be denominated in and based on.
[01:24:25.869 --> 01:24:29.813]  Max Keiser joining us from the Middle East, coming up here in about 10 minutes.
[01:24:31.357 --> 01:24:36.258]  We'll get into what's happening with the open announcements of the end of the dollar, what that will mean, what's happening in the Middle East.
[01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:38.198]  More and more talk of the U.S.
[01:24:38.418 --> 01:24:39.278]  via the U.N.
[01:24:39.318 --> 01:24:42.539]  and NATO invading areas of Libya.
[01:24:42.759 --> 01:24:44.819]  Another horrible idea, but good for the globalists.
[01:24:45.260 --> 01:24:46.020]  Why, it's only U.S.
[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:48.520]  taxpayer money and American boy's blood.
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:49.020]  Why not?
[01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:53.261]  After all, Henry Kissinger called them dumb cannon fodder, dumb animals.
[01:24:53.561 --> 01:24:55.141]  Well, I don't think that about our military.
[01:24:55.481 --> 01:24:57.522]  Let's talk to Juan in California.
[01:24:57.562 --> 01:24:58.622]  Juan, thanks for holding.
[01:24:59.386 --> 01:25:04.228]  Hey Alex, it's an honor speaking to you and it was an honor seeing you here last October in Santa Cruz.
[01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:05.509]  Well thank you, sir, for coming out.
[01:25:06.049 --> 01:25:17.735]  Hey, there was a story on the local news last night and it was a young gentleman who's suing the feds because his mechanic found a GPS tracking system while changing the guy's oil.
[01:25:17.775 --> 01:25:22.277]  And the feds ruled that they're allowed to do that, but then another court ruled they couldn't, correct?
[01:25:23.021 --> 01:25:31.488]  Yeah, I mean, and then he gets knocked on the door by a couple guys in a suit saying they need their device back.
[01:25:32.489 --> 01:25:34.751]  I mean, that's pretty scary.
[01:25:35.812 --> 01:25:36.793]  Well, that's what they're doing.
[01:25:36.833 --> 01:25:38.494]  Look, they don't even need the GPS tracker.
[01:25:38.534 --> 01:25:43.439]  They've got license plate reading cameras all over the country that track you as you drive around.
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.104]  Yeah, I mean, just like what you said about the license plate that they're going to be coming up with with the
[01:25:50.265 --> 01:25:51.805]  With that camera or whatever?
[01:25:52.466 --> 01:25:57.087]  Well, it's a digital waterproof screen with messages and propaganda on it, yes.
[01:25:57.727 --> 01:25:59.867]  Yep, I just hope America wakes up.
[01:26:00.187 --> 01:26:05.269]  I mean, we're slowly waking up, but, you know, this is reality.
[01:26:05.429 --> 01:26:06.709]  It's gotta happen faster, Juan.
[01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:07.789]  Appreciate the good points.
[01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:09.790]  Matt in the UK, you're on the air.
[01:26:11.970 --> 01:26:13.091]  Hi, Alex, and good afternoon.
[01:26:13.111 --> 01:26:14.811]  I'm glad to see you back on the radio.
[01:26:15.259 --> 01:26:30.643]  Yeah, my question is basically, I don't know if you've looked in the British BBC News website, basically there's a guy called Johnny Borg who's a local, well, famous children's presenter, science presenter, and basically the Illuminati and the BBC have basically ridiculed him over the climate change fraudness.
[01:26:31.063 --> 01:26:36.504]  He's basically come out to look like it's a total fraud, and basically what we're doing now, obviously in the local schools around where I am,
[01:26:37.894 --> 01:26:44.136]  I don't know, what's your take on that?
[01:26:44.196 --> 01:26:58.319]  Well I know that British courts ruled a few years ago that Al Gore's movie has been proven on what was it 14 different points at least to be a manifest fraud and that it can't be shown in schools because it's known propaganda but the government just continues to ignore the court.
[01:26:59.386 --> 01:27:17.566]  And I have seen the reports of people being persecuted, different presenters, I hadn't heard about that, children's presenter, for talking about how this is a fraud when they produce TV ads that show children being murdered in bloody explosions if they don't accept the carbon taxes.
[01:27:18.167 --> 01:27:19.589]  I mean, who can make this stuff up?
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:30.389]  Yeah, I mean, I've got two young children of my own and basically they've been brainwashed, like I say, about this basically Rothschild book.
[01:27:30.609 --> 01:27:33.092]  They brought it home and it's just basically a lot of lies.
[01:27:33.132 --> 01:27:36.895]  Well, yeah, that's how we got David de Rothschild on three years ago, four years ago.
[01:27:36.955 --> 01:27:43.902]  He had that children's book with the polar bear grounding on the front because they're the best mammal
[01:27:47.008 --> 01:27:52.671]  Yeah, but basically my son brought it home and I was just looking through it and I said, look, you know, you've got to realize this is a total fraud.
[01:28:12.375 --> 01:28:14.477]  It's about giving children a self-loathing of humanity and a self-hatred.
[01:28:27.566 --> 01:28:38.869]  And I've talked to so many parents who I know personally, who after brainwashing at school, their 8-year-old or 7-year-old daughter will break down crying when they see a construction site saying they're killing Bambi, they're killing Bambi.
[01:28:39.869 --> 01:28:47.351]  And this is all about imprinting a guilt on the children that they're like little Nazis or something and that humans are bad and having children are bad.
[01:28:49.372 --> 01:28:52.596]  Yeah, I mean, obviously there's Johnny Ball and another guy called David Bellamy.
[01:28:52.636 --> 01:28:54.719]  Lord Monckton would probably know who these are.
[01:28:54.739 --> 01:28:57.022]  A great bottomist, David Bellamy.
[01:28:57.342 --> 01:29:00.826]  And again, they've ridiculed even him on national British TV.
[01:29:01.407 --> 01:29:04.171]  And just, you know, basically mocked him, basically.
[01:29:05.578 --> 01:29:07.780]  Well, we're going to have to get Lord Monckton back on.
[01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.042]  It hadn't been on in two or three months.
[01:29:09.062 --> 01:29:12.885]  Let's get Lord Monckton back on, a true staple of this broadcast.
[01:29:12.906 --> 01:29:20.713]  Get the latest on the scallywags trying to put in this eco-dictatorship that has zero, zero to do with helping the environment.
[01:29:21.354 --> 01:29:37.546]  As the globalists stampede forward with cross-species rollouts of plant and animal life, as they roll out with super weapons endangering the planet, no controls over heavy superconducting super colliders, doing experiments that they admit could destroy the planet or seriously damage it.
[01:29:37.566 --> 01:29:46.794]  I mean, there's a score of serious issues that threaten this Earth, and it sure isn't carbon dioxide that are part of the carbon cycle on this planet.
[01:29:47.034 --> 01:29:48.415]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[01:29:50.632 --> 01:29:53.601]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.564 --> 01:29:57.231]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.342 --> 01:30:01.462]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:01.502 --> 01:30:08.165]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:08.425 --> 01:30:10.726]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:10.986 --> 01:30:16.188]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:16.368 --> 01:30:19.129]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:19.409 --> 01:30:21.470]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:27.654]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:27.975 --> 01:30:31.177]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.357 --> 01:30:36.881]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.141 --> 01:30:38.442]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:38.782 --> 01:30:39.983]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.063 --> 01:30:42.625]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:42.745 --> 01:30:46.808]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:46.968 --> 01:30:49.010]  You can find the video at www.
[01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:51.452]  End of America 3.com.
[01:30:51.572 --> 01:30:54.035]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:30:54.156 --> 01:30:57.880]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:30:59.122]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:31:00.387 --> 01:31:03.690]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:05.031]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:09.434]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:31:09.654 --> 01:31:15.299]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:31:15.599 --> 01:31:17.581]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:31:17.741 --> 01:31:20.423]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:20.763 --> 01:31:27.066]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[01:31:27.266 --> 01:31:29.067]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:29.467 --> 01:31:34.549]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:34.809 --> 01:31:39.811]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:31:40.111 --> 01:31:45.334]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:31:45.474 --> 01:31:48.415]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:31:48.655 --> 01:31:51.621]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:31:51.661 --> 01:31:52.422]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:32:03.806 --> 01:32:05.387]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:33.966 --> 01:32:37.970]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:38.270 --> 01:32:43.755]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:44.215 --> 01:32:47.198]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:47.759 --> 01:32:49.180]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.241]  It's here.
[01:32:50.881 --> 01:32:57.668]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:01.237 --> 01:33:03.119]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:03.139 --> 01:33:04.080]  A lie!
[01:33:04.521 --> 01:33:06.223]  No man is obsolete!
[01:33:06.523 --> 01:33:08.345]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:33:08.385 --> 01:33:11.269]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:16.735]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:33:17.095 --> 01:33:19.839]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect!
[01:33:20.519 --> 01:33:24.342]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:33:24.943 --> 01:33:26.024]  I am a human being!
[01:33:26.444 --> 01:33:33.670]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:33:34.190 --> 01:33:34.891]  I don't care!
[01:33:35.331 --> 01:33:36.372]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:33:36.392 --> 01:33:38.474]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[01:33:38.554 --> 01:33:41.096]  And if I speak one thought aloud,
[01:33:41.892 --> 01:33:45.154]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:33:45.615 --> 01:33:48.337]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:33:48.777 --> 01:33:56.222]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:33:56.482 --> 01:34:01.866]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your crime!
[01:34:03.507 --> 01:34:07.070]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:09.352]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:21.772]  We are live, and for the rest of the hour, maybe a little bit into the next, joining us via video Skype from high atop a hotel in Cairo, Egypt, is the one, the only Max Keiser.
[01:34:22.513 --> 01:34:27.299]  Talk about the announcement by the Wall Street Journal, why the dollar's reign is nearing an end.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.063]  Time Magazine saying the good times are over for the United States.
[01:34:31.504 --> 01:34:33.366]  Well, yeah, if we don't kick the banksters out.
[01:34:33.867 --> 01:34:35.409]  We'll be talking to Max Keiser in a moment.
[01:34:35.449 --> 01:34:39.814]  But tomorrow, for a full hour, the one and only Mark Dice will be joining us.
[01:34:40.915 --> 01:34:42.577]  The only place to get his new book.
[01:34:42.617 --> 01:34:45.821]  You can pre-order it now, but it starts shipping, what, in like 20 days.
[01:34:47.222 --> 01:34:48.223]  You can pre-order it now.
[01:34:48.363 --> 01:34:51.064]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare.
[01:34:51.104 --> 01:34:54.405]  And I have a beautiful copy of it here in my hot little hands.
[01:34:54.805 --> 01:35:00.588]  You can go to InfoWars.com and link through on the secure online video shopping cart.
[01:35:03.249 --> 01:35:04.449]  And you can find where you can get it.
[01:35:04.469 --> 01:35:08.371]  We've also got some discounts there where you can get videos discounted when you get it.
[01:35:09.131 --> 01:35:10.012]  Big Brother.
[01:35:11.653 --> 01:35:15.498]  And the full title is The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:35:15.899 --> 01:35:18.562]  This is his most powerful book yet.
[01:35:18.923 --> 01:35:21.346]  There is certainly no doubt about that.
[01:35:21.366 --> 01:35:24.310]  We also have the new V for Victory, You Are The Resistance t-shirts.
[01:35:24.651 --> 01:35:25.392]  Very popular.
[01:35:25.432 --> 01:35:29.257]  A great way to meet like-minded people and share the truth about the New World Order.
[01:35:29.617 --> 01:35:30.878]  And to get conversations going.
[01:35:30.918 --> 01:35:43.065]  But in Big Brother, Mark Dyche details actual high-tech spy gadgets, mind-reading machines, emerging artificial intelligence systems and government projects that seem as if they came right out of George Orwell's novel 1984.
[01:35:43.725 --> 01:35:56.953]  Orwell's famous book was first published in 49 and tells the story of a nightmarish future where citizens have lost all privacy and are continuously monitored by the omnipresent Big Brother surveillance system which keeps them obedient to the totalitarian government.
[01:35:57.313 --> 01:36:03.435]  The novel is eerily prophetic, as many of the fictional systems of surveillance described have now become a reality.
[01:36:03.735 --> 01:36:09.897]  Mark Dice shows you the scary documentation that Big Brother is watching you and is more powerful than you could imagine.
[01:36:10.717 --> 01:36:18.040]  Mind-reading machines, Orwellian government programs, Orwellian weapons, data mine, psychotronics, analysis of 1984,
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:29.165]  Facial Recognition Cameras, Cybernetic Organisms, Neural Interfaces, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, The Nanny State, by the author of the Illuminati Facts and Fiction.
[01:36:29.305 --> 01:36:32.507]  All of his books, by the way, are available at InfoWars.com.
[01:36:33.207 --> 01:36:37.250]  But we have the book first, and for three months after it's published.
[01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:40.591]  Publishing its official shipping date coming up in just a few weeks.
[01:36:40.991 --> 01:36:48.114]  The only place to get it is InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:36:48.554 --> 01:36:54.816]  We're helping him with the rollout because we have our own fulfillment system.
[01:36:54.856 --> 01:36:56.036]  He wanted us to team up with him.
[01:36:56.056 --> 01:36:58.077]  We have and so he's the publisher of it.
[01:36:58.657 --> 01:36:59.437]  It's not my book.
[01:36:59.517 --> 01:37:00.878]  I didn't produce it.
[01:37:01.378 --> 01:37:03.699]  I'm not the... I have no rights to it to be clear.
[01:37:04.219 --> 01:37:07.283]  I'm just helping roll the book out because I think it's so powerful.
[01:37:07.683 --> 01:37:08.524]  Buy Mark Dice.
[01:37:09.025 --> 01:37:11.087]  Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:37:11.447 --> 01:37:13.830]  Get it first at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:14.631]  Get your pre-orders in.
[01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:15.932]  What's the official ship date?
[01:37:16.673 --> 01:37:17.614]  I think it's March 21st, isn't it?
[01:37:19.136 --> 01:37:19.837]  I don't think so.
[01:37:34.298 --> 01:37:34.478]  I think?
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:56.183]  You'll have a master degree in Big Brother if you get this book, Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:37:56.523 --> 01:37:58.024]  Again, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:37:58.044 --> 01:38:00.665]  You can also write to us at P.O.
[01:38:00.705 --> 01:38:01.605]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:38:01.665 --> 01:38:02.246]  Again, P.O.
[01:38:02.326 --> 01:38:03.386]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:38:03.426 --> 01:38:06.948]  It's $19.95, $5 shipping and handling to get Big Brother, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice.
[01:38:06.968 --> 01:38:07.908]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:38:20.405 --> 01:38:22.747]  And going to Max Keiser.
[01:38:23.347 --> 01:38:27.490]  Max Keiser is a filmmaker, broadcaster, and former broker on OptionsTrader.
[01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:38.297]  He's known for his invention of the virtual specialist technology that is ubiquitous across stock markets today, a software system used by the Hollywood Stock Exchange, and for his accurate predictions of global economic events.
[01:38:38.737 --> 01:38:43.440]  He correctly predicted the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac years before the breakdown of Iceland's economy.
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:45.061]  He had inside knowledge on that.
[01:38:45.421 --> 01:38:50.225]  And the subprime mortgage-backed securities would cause an 08 recession.
[01:38:50.945 --> 01:38:56.870]  And he also launched the Crash JP Morgan Buy Silver program here on this broadcast.
[01:38:56.890 --> 01:39:03.635]  He has a show on RT, Press TV, BBC, Saturday Morning Show, here on GenesisMaxKaiser.com.
[01:39:03.695 --> 01:39:07.118]  Our sites again, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:07.138 --> 01:39:08.939]  We're going to cover a lot of issues, but
[01:39:09.259 --> 01:39:11.822]  Saudi Arabia contagion triggers Gulf Route.
[01:39:12.743 --> 01:39:18.949]  There's talk of U.N.-backed, NATO-backed invasion of the nearby country.
[01:39:18.989 --> 01:39:20.931]  To you right now, you're in Cairo, Egypt.
[01:39:21.051 --> 01:39:22.652]  They're in Libya.
[01:39:23.073 --> 01:39:26.516]  I want to get your breakdown on what you're seeing on the ground in Cairo.
[01:39:27.016 --> 01:39:29.259]  Max Keiser, thank you for joining us via video Skype.
[01:39:30.287 --> 01:39:32.108]  Yeah, my pleasure, Alex Jones.
[01:39:32.248 --> 01:39:34.569]  Always a pleasure to be on the InfoWars.
[01:39:34.609 --> 01:39:37.110]  Yes, I'm in Cairo, Egypt.
[01:39:37.130 --> 01:39:40.971]  And what I can tell you, Alex, is that revolutions work.
[01:39:41.711 --> 01:39:42.932]  Revolutions work.
[01:39:43.272 --> 01:39:47.173]  The people here have staged a revolution, a people's revolution.
[01:39:47.674 --> 01:39:49.734]  They toppled the dictator Mubarak.
[01:39:49.794 --> 01:39:51.695]  Mubarak tried to put somebody else in.
[01:39:52.035 --> 01:39:52.996]  That guy is now gone.
[01:39:54.236 --> 01:40:00.178]  There's a huge rally here in Tahrir Square Friday for people amassing once again.
[01:40:00.198 --> 01:40:03.739]  The objective is to write a new constitution.
[01:40:04.139 --> 01:40:10.721]  And I urge everybody who listens to your show to take a look at what's happening here in Cairo.
[01:40:11.102 --> 01:40:14.523]  Because you've got a dictator there at the Federal Reserve Bank.
[01:40:14.783 --> 01:40:17.424]  There needs to be a regime change in the U.S.
[01:40:17.684 --> 01:40:21.185]  If Egyptians can revolt and get rid of the dictator,
[01:40:21.545 --> 01:40:24.488]  Why can't Americans revolt and get rid of their dictators?
[01:40:24.968 --> 01:40:27.030]  And it all happened on new media.
[01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:29.292]  It all happened on social networking.
[01:40:29.552 --> 01:40:33.236]  And I was talking to a lot of the demonstrators and the revolutionaries here.
[01:40:33.656 --> 01:40:37.980]  And they just told me that everybody was on Facebook and social networking sites.
[01:40:38.700 --> 01:40:45.727]  And then one day, as if by some spontaneous magic of a revolutionary fever, just gripped the entire country.
[01:40:45.747 --> 01:40:46.608]  And they said, you know what?
[01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:49.110]  Why don't we just topple this government?
[01:40:49.451 --> 01:40:50.492]  And here's the key, Alex.
[01:40:50.932 --> 01:40:55.017]  I had one of the revolutionaries on my show as a guest today, and I asked him straightforward.
[01:40:55.057 --> 01:40:57.159]  I said, who's leading the revolution?
[01:40:57.700 --> 01:40:59.662]  And the answer is, no one.
[01:41:00.183 --> 01:41:02.646]  Because there is no straight leadership.
[01:41:02.726 --> 01:41:05.289]  It's a social network revolution, the first in history.
[01:41:05.689 --> 01:41:07.410]  So there's nobody to go out and attack.
[01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:11.251]  Nobody can say, well, let's get the revolutionary leader and the revolution dies.
[01:41:11.271 --> 01:41:12.231]  It's not going to happen.
[01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:19.114]  This is going to continue until you breed a real, true people's movement here in Egypt.
[01:41:19.254 --> 01:41:21.735]  And what's amazing is that the people here
[01:41:22.635 --> 01:41:29.118]  Well, speak their mind and then they'll try to catch themselves and they say, oh, I wonder if the police are listening.
[01:41:29.478 --> 01:41:34.021]  And then they have that moment of recognition where they realize that, wait a minute, the police aren't listening, I'm free!
[01:41:34.041 --> 01:41:43.845]  To contrast that with people in America now who speak their mind and then have a moment of recognition where they wonder, is the police listening to me?
[01:41:43.905 --> 01:41:44.686]  And then they shut up!
[01:41:45.806 --> 01:41:48.149]  Okay, it's two ships passing in the night, Alex.
[01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:51.353]  America going toward dictatorship and tyranny.
[01:41:51.774 --> 01:41:54.077]  Egypt heading toward democracy and freedom.
[01:41:54.918 --> 01:42:03.509]  Max, a beautiful shot over your shoulder there of the Mediterranean off of your shoulder or is that or is that a
[01:42:04.978 --> 01:42:12.481]  That's the Nile there, so there's a little bit of a reverb because you're talking kind of towards the glass door.
[01:42:12.921 --> 01:42:24.766]  If you can rotate to your right about 10 or 15 degrees and move the laptop, it won't be as cool a shot, but your audio won't be bouncing off that glass door there at your hotel or on the roof or wherever you're at.
[01:42:25.086 --> 01:42:30.989]  I just want to try to be able to really clearly hear you here, Max, but the audio is passable.
[01:42:32.468 --> 01:42:47.574]  I'm not taking issue with you, but there's no doubt that the globalists tracking social networks a month and a half ago, knowing food prices were going up due to dollar devaluation in the Middle East, knew that a revolution was coming, the dominoes were already set up, they tried to trigger it.
[01:42:48.434 --> 01:42:51.196]  Sending in Alberti a few weeks before it began.
[01:42:51.536 --> 01:42:53.718]  There's no doubt the West wants to overthrow Gaddafi.
[01:42:54.038 --> 01:42:59.942]  There's no doubt that the rebellion is real, but I'm worried about the overall aftershocks of this.
[01:42:59.962 --> 01:43:04.965]  But you're saying you have confidence, Max Keiser, that this is real, this is organic?
[01:43:06.158 --> 01:43:07.699]  Yeah, it is real, and it is organic.
[01:43:07.759 --> 01:43:22.788]  I'm on the street, I'm talking to these people directly, I'm doing shows right here, and they have the notion now that they can rebuild this country in their image, and the People's Revolution is on the street, and it's spreading around this whole region, as you know.
[01:43:23.388 --> 01:43:28.773]  And what's beautiful about the social networking sites is part of the info wars, as you know.
[01:43:29.474 --> 01:43:34.058]  What's beautiful about it, as I said, there's no leader to attack.
[01:43:34.138 --> 01:43:35.740]  So it's widespread.
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:37.361]  It's decentralized.
[01:43:37.842 --> 01:43:40.804]  And the idea itself is bigger than any leader.
[01:43:41.665 --> 01:43:43.245]  And so this is happening.
[01:43:43.306 --> 01:43:44.506]  It's gathering speed.
[01:43:44.866 --> 01:43:47.927]  And the people, as I said, it's like two ships passing in the night.
[01:43:47.947 --> 01:43:51.088]  When I'm here in Egypt, there's a feeling of freedom and new freedom.
[01:43:51.448 --> 01:43:57.449]  And when I talk to people in America, it's a freedom of shutting down, heading into the prison state, heading into the gulag state.
[01:43:57.829 --> 01:43:59.590]  So it's a complete opposite feeling.
[01:43:59.610 --> 01:44:01.190]  Here it's genuine freedom.
[01:44:01.250 --> 01:44:02.611]  People really have a taste for it.
[01:44:02.911 --> 01:44:03.711]  And it's remarkable.
[01:44:03.931 --> 01:44:14.017]  So the people are genuinely angry, but there's not a clear leadership, and if the leadership doesn't deliver what the people want, the people now know the power they have.
[01:44:14.037 --> 01:44:21.321]  You're saying the momentum has shifted towards the independent person getting more freedom?
[01:44:22.245 --> 01:44:22.745]  Absolutely.
[01:44:23.886 --> 01:44:26.948]  The power has shifted and exactly right.
[01:44:27.348 --> 01:44:34.673]  No matter what the current leadership in office suggests is what they want to do, the people are responding.
[01:44:34.793 --> 01:44:38.736]  For example, they tried to put in a new Prime Minister recently.
[01:44:38.796 --> 01:44:41.278]  Today he resigned because the people said we don't want that guy.
[01:44:41.838 --> 01:44:50.185]  Now imagine if the people of America had the power to choose who was maybe going to run or not run the Federal Reserve Bank, for example.
[01:44:50.505 --> 01:44:52.146]  I mean, what a remarkable idea!
[01:44:52.366 --> 01:44:52.947]  Democracy!
[01:44:52.987 --> 01:44:54.068]  What a remarkable idea!
[01:44:54.288 --> 01:44:54.968]  People power!
[01:44:55.429 --> 01:45:01.293]  And the key to this whole technologically-enabled, enhanced revolution.
[01:45:01.474 --> 01:45:06.598]  And of course, the government can't shut down the Internet without shutting down the entire country.
[01:45:06.798 --> 01:45:08.079]  So they don't have that option.
[01:45:08.539 --> 01:45:10.220]  So they are beat.
[01:45:10.361 --> 01:45:14.364]  This current leadership in this country and around the region are basically out of business.
[01:45:15.004 --> 01:45:17.627]  And the people now are pushing forward.
[01:45:17.667 --> 01:45:22.631]  And of course it's not based on Islam, it's not based on any politics, it's not based on any religion.
[01:45:22.671 --> 01:45:30.877]  I see Glenn Beck over in the UK and in the US is trying to push this line that this is an Islamist revolution.
[01:45:31.678 --> 01:45:36.702]  Which is completely wrong, and there's nothing religious or theocratic about this People's Revolution.
[01:45:36.722 --> 01:45:53.255]  Well, there's certainly the Muslim Brotherhood element in it, but expanding on that, looking to the West there with what's happening in Libya, what's your view on Muammar Gaddafi with all the British weapons he's got, the open talk of having some type of NATO slash UN slash US
[01:45:54.756 --> 01:45:59.038]  Ad-hoc group going in there currently backing the rebels in the east.
[01:45:59.058 --> 01:46:00.739]  They're on the border with Egypt.
[01:46:00.759 --> 01:46:04.541]  What do you think about the incredible turmoil popping up in Saudi Arabia?
[01:46:04.581 --> 01:46:05.642]  Do you see this thing spreading?
[01:46:06.667 --> 01:46:15.657]  Well, the question with Qaddafi, you have to ask yourself, is they discovered he's got $30 billion parked in banks in the UK and the US.
[01:46:16.098 --> 01:46:25.929]  Now, that money was parked after the Patriot Act was enacted, which supposedly put in rules and force that would prevent that kind of activity from happening.
[01:46:26.289 --> 01:46:29.932]  So, did Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan give Qaddafi a waiver?
[01:46:30.252 --> 01:46:33.675]  Did the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner give Qaddafi a waiver?
[01:46:33.955 --> 01:46:35.536]  He didn't have to comply with the law.
[01:46:35.736 --> 01:46:37.678]  Why doesn't Qaddafi have to comply with the law?
[01:46:37.878 --> 01:46:39.759]  And everyone else does have to comply with the law.
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.461]  What about Tony Blair?
[01:46:41.521 --> 01:46:44.243]  Wasn't he Qaddafi's good friend just two or three years ago?
[01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:48.386]  Selling him arms, cooking up blood for oil deals after the Iraq...
[01:46:48.966 --> 01:46:49.847]  Uh, Fandango?
[01:46:50.127 --> 01:46:51.307]  Where's Blair in all this?
[01:46:51.327 --> 01:46:54.689]  How come Tony Blair's not out there supporting his friend, Colonel Gaddafi?
[01:46:54.989 --> 01:47:00.792]  It's utter lunacy and hypocrisy, uh, that Gaddafi... Well, that's just like a few months ago it came out that one U.S.
[01:47:00.852 --> 01:47:11.557]  bank alone laundered $360-plus billion in Mexican narcotics money, and was even chartering the airplanes and owning the airplanes for them, but the banks don't get in trouble for this.
[01:47:13.536 --> 01:47:14.156]  Exactly right.
[01:47:14.216 --> 01:47:30.804]  So the banks are on a two-speed economy and a two-speed politics, which is a kleptocracy, which is tyrannical, which is why Americans should be revolting, which is why there should be a million people crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and surrounding the Federal Reserve Bank in New York and demanding the current Fed head of the New York Fed comes out!
[01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:31.304]  That's right.
[01:47:31.404 --> 01:47:33.505]  People should be... I mean, people always talk about marching.
[01:47:33.585 --> 01:47:38.607]  Washington is where the castrated ceremonial puppets are.
[01:47:38.967 --> 01:47:41.949]  If people are really going to march, it should be on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
[01:47:43.624 --> 01:47:44.184]  Absolutely.
[01:47:44.204 --> 01:47:46.045]  I mean, that's where the dictatorship is.
[01:47:46.245 --> 01:47:47.586]  Revolutions work, Alex.
[01:47:47.626 --> 01:48:00.311]  That's my message from Cairo, Egypt, is that if it's a decentralized, true, organic people's revolution, the establishment powers, even if they're armed like these regimes are armed, they can't do anything about it.
[01:48:00.551 --> 01:48:03.272]  So the question to Americans are, what are you waiting for?
[01:48:03.573 --> 01:48:04.733]  The time is now.
[01:48:04.773 --> 01:48:06.654]  You're being held hostage by tyrants.
[01:48:07.234 --> 01:48:12.636]  Why are you letting people in this North Africa and the Middle East make you look like you like being in prison?
[01:48:12.756 --> 01:48:14.697]  That you like being ruled over by tyrants?
[01:48:14.757 --> 01:48:15.617]  What are you waiting for?
[01:48:16.838 --> 01:48:23.360]  Max, looking at other areas of the Middle East, the Saudi King pumping out 37 million last week, millions more this week.
[01:48:24.100 --> 01:48:25.621]  Tanks rolling around the streets there.
[01:48:26.141 --> 01:48:27.762]  What's the feeling on the street in Cairo?
[01:48:27.842 --> 01:48:33.044]  Is it that this revolution against the plutocrats and the corrupt royalty and the dictators is going to continue?
[01:48:34.158 --> 01:48:35.220]  Well, it's definitely spreading.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:39.267]  You know, outside of Saudi Arabia is Bahrain, and that has been very active.
[01:48:39.768 --> 01:48:43.255]  And Saudi Arabia is the kingpin in the region.
[01:48:43.455 --> 01:48:46.000]  They're the... You know, there's three big players in the...
[01:48:47.981 --> 01:48:50.982]  North Africa and the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and the United States.
[01:48:51.542 --> 01:48:54.863]  And the Saudi Arabian unrest is percolating.
[01:48:55.443 --> 01:49:02.724]  The royal family is trying to buy off the people by increasing the amount of money they're giving them.
[01:49:03.285 --> 01:49:05.405]  We see this happening in other regimes as well.
[01:49:05.825 --> 01:49:07.186]  They're trying to buy the people off.
[01:49:07.506 --> 01:49:08.846]  But the people at this point
[01:49:09.766 --> 01:49:14.891]  They're feeling that no money, no amount of money can buy them off because they want to feel something more than money.
[01:49:14.931 --> 01:49:16.192]  They want to feel integrity.
[01:49:16.452 --> 01:49:18.254]  They want to feel like their life is worth something.
[01:49:18.294 --> 01:49:36.170]  Well, that's the bigger issue is that in these corrupt, swaggering police states, people are tired of the arrogance and the abuse of the security forces and they always want it to go away and no amount of money by these arrogant bureaucracies, whether it's here or in Saudi Arabia, is going to assuage the people's rage.
[01:49:37.625 --> 01:49:47.890]  No, and remember when Bush took office back when he threw that election back in 2000, and again in 2004, he really sent everybody in America a check for between $600 and $1200.
[01:49:48.810 --> 01:49:55.273]  So he's mimicking these Middle East kings and rulers by giving the peasants a few dollars to shut them up.
[01:49:55.753 --> 01:49:56.974]  I mean, how outrageous is that?
[01:49:57.214 --> 01:49:59.935]  I mean, is that all a life in America is worth?
[01:50:00.835 --> 01:50:03.477]  $600 from Bush, the royal monarch?
[01:50:03.737 --> 01:50:06.158]  I mean, give yourself some kind of self-respect!
[01:50:08.925 --> 01:50:13.586]  Max, when we come back from break, I want to get into more of what's happening in the Middle East.
[01:50:13.626 --> 01:50:15.567]  Maybe keep you a little bit of the next hour if we can.
[01:50:16.567 --> 01:50:20.388]  Joining us again via video link from Cairo, Egypt, right off the Nile there.
[01:50:20.428 --> 01:50:23.529]  Amazing video shot of your PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[01:50:23.849 --> 01:50:26.189]  Radio listeners are again getting to hear his analysis.
[01:50:26.549 --> 01:50:34.271]  I want to get into this sudden announcement in the Wall Street Journal, in Time Magazine, that America's over, that the dollar is going to die.
[01:50:34.591 --> 01:50:36.292]  Why you think they're announcing that now?
[01:50:36.672 --> 01:50:37.752]  What this signifies?
[01:50:38.152 --> 01:50:45.138]  The Chinese openly announcing that they're going to demand all trade by the end of this year be in their currency.
[01:50:46.059 --> 01:50:46.700]  The yuan.
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.702]  These are earth-shattering economic announcements.
[01:50:49.983 --> 01:50:53.686]  It's old news for our audience, but it's big that it's now being announced.
[01:50:54.006 --> 01:50:55.227]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:56.328]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:50:56.348 --> 01:50:58.710]  This is the GCN Radio Network, GCNLive.com.
[01:51:00.484 --> 01:51:01.225]  Nine years.

[01:51:10.011 --> 01:51:10.972]  My name is Crystal.
[01:51:11.332 --> 01:51:13.894]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[01:51:14.274 --> 01:51:17.877]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[01:51:18.237 --> 01:51:22.240]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:23.200]  What did Crystal do?
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:25.622]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[01:51:27.143 --> 01:51:33.445]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[01:51:33.565 --> 01:51:37.165]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[01:52:00.133 --> 01:52:01.393]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.433 --> 01:52:06.777]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.017 --> 01:52:11.639]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:17.063]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.603 --> 01:52:22.284]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.824 --> 01:52:24.745]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.125 --> 01:52:29.746]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:29.926 --> 01:52:30.826]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.046 --> 01:52:33.807]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.107 --> 01:52:37.408]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:52:44.232 --> 01:52:47.234]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:47.714 --> 01:52:49.476]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:53:09.922 --> 01:53:17.590]  Ali-C has been scientifically proven in double-blind studies using low doses to greatly reduce the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[01:53:17.970 --> 01:53:23.353]  Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin, the active ingredient in crushed garlic.
[01:53:23.533 --> 01:53:28.215]  Studies show Ali-C is effective against MRSA, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections.
[01:53:28.755 --> 01:53:32.117]  One tablet of Ali-C has the equivalent of 40 cloves of garlic.
[01:53:32.457 --> 01:53:38.600]  Ali-C supports your body's resistance to all types of conditions and can help lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:43.521]  So boost your body's resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract, Ali-C.

[01:54:13.570 --> 01:54:22.776]  Max Keiser's with us five minutes to the next hour and then I had scheduled from last week an interview part two with Lenny Dykstra who has beaten JP Morgan in court.
[01:54:22.816 --> 01:54:25.138]  He's beaten the SEC over 200 times.
[01:54:25.258 --> 01:54:30.061]  Remember they took his houses, claimed that he was, you know, insolvent.
[01:54:30.842 --> 01:54:32.903]  I want to get him on to talk about mortgage fraud.
[01:54:32.943 --> 01:54:34.544]  We'll also talk about Charlie Sheen some.
[01:54:35.004 --> 01:54:37.106]  I was in a meeting for an hour and a half last night with Lenny and
[01:54:37.466 --> 01:54:39.268]  And Charlie, we won't get into that private meeting.
[01:54:39.668 --> 01:54:43.452]  The point is we're trying to help Charlie out to navigate through all this stuff that's going on.
[01:54:43.492 --> 01:54:46.875]  So that's coming up in about 10 minutes from now.
[01:54:47.196 --> 01:54:48.397]  Going back to Max Keiser.
[01:54:48.697 --> 01:54:54.423]  Max, what do you make of the Wall Street Journal coming out today and saying why the dollar's reign is near an end?
[01:54:55.044 --> 01:54:55.684]  The Chinese...
[01:54:56.585 --> 01:55:04.016]  have come out today and saying by the end of this year they want all trade all purchases of Chinese goods to be in their currency.
[01:55:05.999 --> 01:55:07.901]  Why are they doing this now and how big is this?
[01:55:09.605 --> 01:55:12.729]  Well, they're doing it now because there's no denying it anymore.
[01:55:12.749 --> 01:55:16.633]  They can't hide it anymore, and everybody knows it.
[01:55:17.274 --> 01:55:19.136]  I mean, this is no secret.
[01:55:19.516 --> 01:55:27.446]  The dollar is no longer going to work as a world reserve currency anymore, and we're moving toward a new global currency grid.
[01:55:27.946 --> 01:55:30.289]  The dollar's going to play a lot less of a role.
[01:55:30.509 --> 01:55:41.179]  The key to understand is that when the time for the dollar to devalue comes, it'll happen in one day, and suddenly everything in America will cost two to three times more.
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.423]  And the President will say, well, we had no choice.
[01:55:45.023 --> 01:55:48.066]  We had to devalue the dollar because it's going to help you.
[01:55:48.226 --> 01:55:50.609]  Our export market is going to help you get jobs.
[01:55:50.869 --> 01:55:54.993]  Of course, the jobs that America will be qualified for at that point will be cock-kicking.
[01:55:55.533 --> 01:56:00.095]  So you're going to have 20 million cotton pickers in America competing with cotton pickers around the world.
[01:56:00.835 --> 01:56:01.836]  So it's over.
[01:56:01.936 --> 01:56:04.577]  The Wall Street Journal is stating the obvious.
[01:56:04.597 --> 01:56:08.518]  At some point it's embarrassing for them to pretend like this is not the case.
[01:56:08.578 --> 01:56:12.700]  I mean, they have to at least recognize what's the obvious situation.
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:14.080]  So they can't hide it anymore.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:16.321]  It's exactly what we've been saying on your show.
[01:56:16.581 --> 01:56:18.662]  And it's why gold and silver are hitting new highs.
[01:56:18.962 --> 01:56:23.564]  They'll continue to hit new highs because the fiat currency regime and the U.S.
[01:56:23.604 --> 01:56:23.924]  dollar
[01:56:24.304 --> 01:56:24.765]  Period.
[01:56:25.045 --> 01:56:25.585]  It's finished.
[01:56:25.665 --> 01:56:26.226]  It's that simple.
[01:56:28.888 --> 01:56:38.918]  Max, but the question is, why have they gone from denying that this was a certainty mathematically with what they've done with the dollar globally to now saying, yes, it's coming?
[01:56:41.021 --> 01:56:55.672]  Well, I think that they're now preparing to set up the new banking facilities because, you know, when the dollar crashes and it's replaced with another global currency of some type, an expanded special drawing rights, that's a huge piece of business for the banksters.
[01:56:56.073 --> 01:56:57.754]  They will have to convert U.S.
[01:56:57.774 --> 01:57:00.376]  dollars into SDRs, trade bonds based on that.
[01:57:00.396 --> 01:57:04.619]  Remember, before Davos, they said they needed to create a $100 trillion new credit facility?
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.301]  That's huge fees!
[01:57:06.741 --> 01:57:09.042]  For Morgan and Goldman Sachs are the banksters.
[01:57:09.243 --> 01:57:17.988]  So they're preparing for a huge piece of business and their Christmas bonuses next year will be based on dismantling the dollar and rolling out the new currency.
[01:57:18.208 --> 01:57:28.894]  So I would anticipate that within the next three to six months, the Wall Street Journal will introduce America to the new currency and how great it is and how everyone's going to love it.
[01:57:29.194 --> 01:57:31.876]  And by the way, the banks on Wall Street are going to make a huge killing
[01:57:32.376 --> 01:57:38.660]  In issuing bonds in this new currency and everything's going to be created in this new currency and it's going to be fantastic.
[01:57:38.700 --> 01:57:50.647]  Of course what they won't mention is that it's going to lower the purchasing power of Americans by 50 to 60 percent and America will officially be in the second world and making its way to the third world.
[01:57:52.213 --> 01:58:00.140]  Unless we finally kick the real government, it's illegitimate, but it's the government, this banking cartel, out of the country.
[01:58:01.161 --> 01:58:02.623]  I mean, it's either us or them.
[01:58:03.763 --> 01:58:14.114]  Well, Alex, okay, the bridge right behind me here in Cairo, a million people walked over that bridge four weeks ago and toppled their government without a single shot, without any guns, with nothing.
[01:58:14.594 --> 01:58:18.518]  No money, no military, just with the will to be free.
[01:58:18.598 --> 01:58:19.519]  It happened right here.
[01:58:19.879 --> 01:58:23.583]  So you tell me there's a regime in America and its tyrants are ruling the country.
[01:58:23.844 --> 01:58:24.905]  What are you waiting for?
[01:58:25.405 --> 01:58:27.286]  What are you waiting for, America?
[01:58:27.407 --> 01:58:28.647]  What are you waiting for?
[01:58:28.868 --> 01:58:29.808]  What is it going to take?
[01:58:30.128 --> 01:58:31.349]  How many of you have to go to jail?
[01:58:31.509 --> 01:58:33.351]  How many of you have to have their money stolen?
[01:58:33.491 --> 01:58:37.694]  How many jobs have to be outsourced to Egypt and the rest of the world?
[01:58:37.734 --> 01:58:38.594]  How many lies?
[01:58:38.675 --> 01:58:39.175]  Stay there.
[01:58:41.957 --> 01:58:43.738]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:53.731]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:58:54.091 --> 01:58:58.151]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:58:58.372 --> 01:59:03.012]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:59:03.072 --> 01:59:08.253]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:59:09.013 --> 01:59:12.534]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:59:12.674 --> 01:59:16.095]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:59:18.972 --> 01:59:25.760]  We're American and be proud.

[01:59:53.215 --> 01:59:55.157]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.597 --> 01:59:58.379]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.963 --> 02:00:09.144]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.804 --> 02:00:10.604]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.384 --> 02:00:12.325]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.925 --> 02:00:16.485]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.126 --> 02:00:21.206]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.202 --> 02:00:35.945]  Now into hour number three, talking to Max Keiser, who is on fire.
[02:00:37.306 --> 02:00:54.278]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is a mathematical certainty every economist we've had on for more than 12 years, from George Humphrey right through to Webster Tarpley, has broken down that once they launch derivatives, it's a mathematical certainty that if the bankers can tie us to their fraudulent debt, it's over.
[02:00:54.818 --> 02:01:04.280]  And they've tied the dollar to it and now they're reorganizing this new global SDR basket based in a new fiat system they control so they can buy up the planet through fraud.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:12.602]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if we ever let private bankers control the issuance of currency and credit, our children will wake up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered.
[02:01:13.202 --> 02:01:19.723]  Max, in the four minutes we've got left in this short segment, we better have a revolution of understanding.
[02:01:20.044 --> 02:01:21.904]  You know, Egyptians knew the tyranny they were under.
[02:01:23.305 --> 02:01:25.746]  People in Tripoli knew the tyranny they were under in Libya.
[02:01:26.187 --> 02:01:29.509]  The average American still doesn't understand that the Federal Reserve is the enemy.
[02:01:29.829 --> 02:01:43.038]  Though we've gone from Ron Paul having one co-sponsor to being able to pass his audit to the Fed in the House, and though Gallup polls and others show over 80% do want to abolish it, people need to understand this is the number one issue.
[02:01:44.699 --> 02:01:48.761]  People of Cairo, cross-check Morgan Weisselberg!
[02:01:49.082 --> 02:01:50.623]  People of Cairo, listen to me!
[02:01:52.018 --> 02:01:56.041]  Sorry, Alex, I was just trying to get my part of the revolution started.
[02:01:56.901 --> 02:02:03.386]  Yeah, listen, I was just listening to that commercial for Diamond Gusset Jeans about some people down in America crying.
[02:02:03.486 --> 02:02:04.747]  Woohoo!
[02:02:04.967 --> 02:02:06.768]  America's finished!
[02:02:07.068 --> 02:02:09.410]  Meanwhile, the people of Cairo are dancing in the streets!
[02:02:09.711 --> 02:02:11.753]  Because they just changed this disgusting revolution!
[02:02:12.153 --> 02:02:12.994]  They're dancing here!
[02:02:13.054 --> 02:02:13.655]  They're happy!
[02:02:13.895 --> 02:02:17.639]  They're full of pride and integrity that they overthrew a dictator!
[02:02:17.999 --> 02:02:18.940]  Stop crying!
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.041]  Stop whining!
[02:02:20.322 --> 02:02:22.003]  Stop being a big frickin' baby!
[02:02:22.424 --> 02:02:22.964]  Revolt!
[02:02:23.305 --> 02:02:24.466]  You must revolt now!
[02:02:24.586 --> 02:02:26.108]  Or you're gonna be in prison!
[02:02:26.388 --> 02:02:27.449]  In the prison plant!
[02:02:28.210 --> 02:02:29.131]  You must do it now!
[02:02:31.305 --> 02:02:32.388]  You're calling for revolt.
[02:02:32.428 --> 02:02:37.421]  You mean peaceful mass demonstration, kind of like what they're doing in Wisconsin, taking over the Capitol?
[02:02:38.885 --> 02:02:40.827]  Well, Wisconsin's a great example to people.
[02:02:40.847 --> 02:02:53.280]  I think the people in Wisconsin don't fully understand the issues that are at stake because they're defining their issues in that fake left-wing paradigm that you talk about all the time.
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:03:01.728]  I think they need to understand that everyone in Wisconsin's a loser if Scott Walker, who's a representative of the banking kleptocracy,
[02:03:02.469 --> 02:03:04.490]  The Koch Brothers kleptocracy.
[02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:07.171]  If he wins, everybody loses.
[02:03:07.271 --> 02:03:08.351]  Nobody wins if he wins.
[02:03:08.371 --> 02:03:10.872]  So, they have to understand that mentality.
[02:03:10.892 --> 02:03:14.113]  Their right to march on the Capitol building, 70,000 people did.
[02:03:14.414 --> 02:03:15.634]  That's spreading to Ohio.
[02:03:15.914 --> 02:03:17.455]  I say from Ohio to Cairo.
[02:03:17.875 --> 02:03:20.356]  From Ohio to Cairo, let freedom ring!
[02:03:21.036 --> 02:03:23.258]  And it's a peaceful revolution we saw here.
[02:03:23.278 --> 02:03:25.659]  You don't need to be violently uprising.
[02:03:25.699 --> 02:03:26.680]  You don't even need a leader.
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:28.141]  All you need is an idea.
[02:03:28.521 --> 02:03:32.164]  Let that idea percolate on the social networks and act on that idea.
[02:03:32.464 --> 02:03:34.546]  Literally, it happened overnight here, Alex, in Cairo.
[02:03:34.946 --> 02:03:37.007]  I was talking to a guy, interviewed him for my show today.
[02:03:37.288 --> 02:03:44.693]  He said, one day, we were playing video games on the internet and didn't think at all about this movement or this revolution.
[02:03:44.833 --> 02:03:47.195]  And within one day, it just sparked.
[02:03:47.215 --> 02:03:47.835]  Within a day.
[02:03:47.895 --> 02:03:50.357]  The next day, they were in Tahrir Square
[02:03:50.757 --> 02:03:51.598]  A million strong.
[02:03:51.638 --> 02:03:52.718]  It happened that quickly.
[02:03:53.119 --> 02:04:01.525]  Because if all it takes is an idea now, and the social networking is able to give the voice an action, and it can happen quickly.
[02:04:01.585 --> 02:04:07.489]  So my, again, it was Madison, Wisconsin, Ohio, are all these states and Americans that are going bankrupt.
[02:04:07.649 --> 02:04:09.730]  People are imposing austerity measures.
[02:04:09.770 --> 02:04:14.734]  The bankers want Americans to eat the austerity measures for the mistakes that they made.
[02:04:15.094 --> 02:04:16.154]  Max, we're out of time.
[02:04:16.374 --> 02:04:17.155]  Max, we're out of time.
[02:04:17.195 --> 02:04:19.455]  We appreciate you reporting from the Middle East for us.
[02:04:19.515 --> 02:04:20.636]  Where are you headed next?
[02:04:22.496 --> 02:04:25.737]  I might be going back to Paris or I might be going to Oman.
[02:04:25.877 --> 02:04:26.357]  I'm not sure.
[02:04:26.377 --> 02:04:27.258]  I'll know more tomorrow.
[02:04:27.778 --> 02:04:32.919]  Well, if you do that, we want to have you pop back in this week, even if it's Sunday from the 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:04:32.959 --> 02:04:33.259]  program.
[02:04:33.279 --> 02:04:35.400]  It'll be at like midnight your time.
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:37.321]  But Max, we really appreciate you joining us.
[02:04:37.641 --> 02:04:39.521]  Is this not Buck Rogers science fiction?
[02:04:39.921 --> 02:04:41.862]  He's on a rooftop over the Nile.
[02:04:42.242 --> 02:04:47.771]  Talking to us live time from 8,000, 9,000 miles away from Cairo, Egypt.
[02:04:47.811 --> 02:04:51.117]  And we're here in Austin, Texas, bouncing off satellites all over the world.
[02:04:51.457 --> 02:04:53.360]  Max Keiser, always great hearing from you.
[02:04:53.380 --> 02:04:54.542]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:04:54.843 --> 02:04:55.804]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:55.824 --> 02:04:56.385]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.213 --> 02:05:04.456]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:04.757 --> 02:05:05.037]  Number 1.
[02:05:05.677 --> 02:05:08.820]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.100 --> 02:05:09.660]  Number 2.
[02:05:09.961 --> 02:05:14.524]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:14.864 --> 02:05:15.305]  It's true.
[02:05:15.605 --> 02:05:20.168]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:20.469 --> 02:05:21.009]  Number 3.
