[00:00:04.931 --> 00:00:06.231]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.992]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:09.753]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.753 --> 00:00:11.353]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.353 --> 00:00:12.874]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.874 --> 00:00:17.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:21.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.492]  Well, I am living in the Twilight Zone, and I know you are as well.
[00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:30.293]  It is Thursday, the 20th day of October, 2011.
[00:00:30.293 --> 00:00:34.116]  We're going to get into the whole supposed Qaddafi killing.
[00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:40.860]  If you go to thedrudgereport.com, there is a News Channel 5 story.
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.021]  Tennessee becomes first state to fight terrorism statewide.
[00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:47.463]  The TSA rolls out checkpoints on the highways.
[00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:50.746]  Homeland Security already did this two years ago.
[00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:54.708]  It's in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.630]  And TSA was involved in that.
[00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:02.814]  But I've always told you, we're going to have domestic checkpoints, just like the over 100 they have.
[00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:10.518]  Inside the United States under federal regulations up to 100 miles inside.
[00:01:10.518 --> 00:01:14.440]  I went back through one of these again yesterday and it was explosive.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.322]  I'm going to be airing that tonight on the nightly news.
[00:01:17.322 --> 00:01:19.423]  I just got into the office an hour or so ago.
[00:01:19.423 --> 00:01:23.705]  And they're getting that video off my camera.
[00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.366]  I really got in their face this time.
[00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:31.969]  And I told them that the government are drug dealers and criminals and that I don't respect their unconstitutional activity.
[00:01:33.778 --> 00:01:37.821]  And I just really can't take it anymore.
[00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:39.243]  I'm getting to where I can't handle it anymore.
[00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:51.392]  I mean, the flying, the naked body scanners, the groping, the TSA at high school proms in New Mexico, and now this headline.
[00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:52.653]  I hadn't even seen this.
[00:01:52.653 --> 00:01:54.815]  It's up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:54.815 --> 00:02:01.981]  Drudge also is linked to the report that we posted at Infowars.com that Paul Watson did.
[00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.273]  With the headline that State Department sends in one of the leaders of the Arab Spring from Egypt to run Occupy Wall Street.
[00:02:11.273 --> 00:02:15.055]  It is CIA, State Department, Obama run.
[00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:17.136]  That doesn't mean the people that showed up for it are bad.
[00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.317]  There's a lot of corruption on Wall Street.
[00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:22.118]  That is where most of the problems are emanating from.
[00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:26.300]  But not Wall Street itself generally, but the actual private Federal Reserve.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.141]  That report is up at DrudgeReport.com as well.
[00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:34.806]  But it's just the nightmare just keeps coming more and more true here.
[00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:37.129]  The nightmare just continues to intensify.
[00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.954]  And we are going into an authoritarian nightmare.
[00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:48.081]  And I personally am beyond disgusted, beyond angry, beyond rage right now.
[00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.211]  I don't know.
[00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.471]  And that's back in the news today.
[00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:14.074]  And then meanwhile, I pull up and they're waving everybody through but they want to search my car.
[00:03:14.074 --> 00:03:17.175]  And I've got to tell the Border Patrol I'm going to have to sue you.
[00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:20.637]  This is 98 miles inside the US.
[00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:23.238]  And I'm not against the individual Border Patrol people.
[00:03:23.238 --> 00:03:28.541]  But I literally have to have this stand down, this standoff with them when I get in their face.
[00:03:29.795 --> 00:03:33.077]  And where my kids are sitting there watching this and then they tell me to go.
[00:03:33.077 --> 00:03:35.679]  I mean, they had like six of them flying over.
[00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.180]  They said, pull over there.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.961]  We're going to search you.
[00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.542]  And I said, I'm going to sue you.
[00:03:39.542 --> 00:03:42.925]  You come on here and violate my Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:54.013]  And you know, the Supreme Court has ruled they can have these checkpoints 100 miles in to check immigration status.
[00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:55.454]  And I believe that's unconstitutional.
[00:03:56.892 --> 00:03:59.734]  Besides, the globalists don't want to check immigration status.
[00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:04.256]  Homeland Security's been caught hiring illegals to build part of the Texas border fence that's for show.
[00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:09.299]  That's on record, Associated Press, Fox News.
[00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.581]  But they can't do it for drugs.
[00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:16.503]  And they were sticking, having people open their doors, stick the drug dog in.
[00:04:16.503 --> 00:04:22.407]  This is 98 miles inside the US, inside South Texas.
[00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.188]  And they said, pull over there, we're coming on board.
[00:04:25.188 --> 00:04:25.869]  And I said, look.
[00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:27.677]  We're U.S.
[00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:28.958]  citizens.
[00:04:28.958 --> 00:04:32.021]  You can run the plates of this vehicle.
[00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:36.405]  I said, if I was from Mexico, I'm the best actor in the world, basically.
[00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:39.969]  And I said, you're not going to search my vehicle with that drug dog.
[00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.272]  I said, besides, the government and the Border Patrol have been caught bringing drugs in here.
[00:04:43.272 --> 00:04:45.054]  They all smile.
[00:04:45.054 --> 00:04:47.176]  And then my wife got in their face.
[00:04:47.176 --> 00:04:47.697]  It was just...
[00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.133]  Not even emotionally draining.
[00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:56.905]  I have such clarity now that it's pure torture to have this level of understanding.
[00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:57.446]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.958 --> 00:05:01.138]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:05:01.138 --> 00:05:08.079]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:10.620]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.001]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.041]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.342]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:27.283]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:05:27.603 --> 00:05:30.985]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:05:30.985 --> 00:05:36.768]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:38.409]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.710]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.371]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:46.614]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:05:46.614 --> 00:05:49.235]  You can find the video at www.barronjones.com.
[00:05:49.395 --> 00:05:51.216]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:53.798]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.

[00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:05.605]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:05.605 --> 00:06:07.907]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:06:13.764 --> 00:06:22.887]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, 20th day of October 2011 transmission.
[00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:37.193]  Wayne Madsen, who's recently been inside Libya, investigative journalist, will be joining us coming up in about 25 minutes from now to break down the report that Muammar Gaddafi has been killed hiding in a spider hole.
[00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:50.366]  John B. Wells, syndicated radio host for Coast to Coast AM, who covers a lot of the same issues that we get into with great eloquence, will be joining us for 50 minutes of the second hour.
[00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:59.112]  Webster Tarbley, who was on yesterday, will pop in because he's recently been to Libya to give us his take on this latest Muammar Qaddafi report.
[00:06:59.112 --> 00:07:02.134]  And I'm also going to get a 10-minute pop-in from Steve Pchenik.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:08.121]  Because again, he called us up this morning and saying he thinks it's staged and has some sources.
[00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:18.244]  So we'll just get about a 10-minute pop-in from him and Tarpley coming up here on the broadcast today.
[00:07:18.244 --> 00:07:26.546]  Now also coming up, at least on nightly news tonight, I may air it if Dew has time to get it off my camera and loaded.
[00:07:27.918 --> 00:07:33.163]  I've got to blur out my children's faces and their names and things.
[00:07:33.163 --> 00:07:41.892]  I went to the South Texas beach a few weeks ago over the weekend, drove back 98 miles inside the U.S., and they're now building more of these.
[00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:43.214]  There's over 100 in the country.
[00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:46.457]  There's more than 15 in Texas.
[00:07:46.457 --> 00:07:48.019]  And they wanted to search our car.
[00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:50.411]  I don't
[00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:08.626]  Giving illegals green cards when they do arrest them.
[00:08:08.626 --> 00:08:11.527]  Of course, that's come out for three years, they're doing that.
[00:08:11.527 --> 00:08:18.150]  They've stopped basically all deportations of Mexicans because that's a political client state now.
[00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:26.054]  And I guess for Democratic voters, Salvadorans and others are being shipped out of the country.
[00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:30.275]  In fact, they've got a big Bayview detention center down there by South Padre.
[00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:33.997]  It's got 5,000 Salvadorans, people from El Salvador,
[00:08:35.477 --> 00:08:41.580]  So it's also very discriminatory, but there's a globalist deal with Mexico to basically merge the two countries.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:53.885]  It also came out in the McAllen newspaper after Talk Radio covered it, after Glenn Beck did, that the children are taught to pledge allegiance to Mexico and to salute the Mexican flag.
[00:08:53.885 --> 00:09:02.648]  This goes on all over the United States in any school that's 30 or 40 percent Hispanic, including Puerto Rican schools, schools that are predominantly Puerto Rican.
[00:09:02.648 --> 00:09:04.109]  Puerto Ricans have complained about it.
[00:09:04.449 --> 00:09:06.612]  This is not a new phenomenon.
[00:09:06.612 --> 00:09:08.334]  They say, well, we're not Mexican.
[00:09:08.334 --> 00:09:09.616]  Nothing wrong with being Mexican.
[00:09:09.616 --> 00:09:16.746]  But, you know, the Ford Foundation has said, if you've got brown skin and are Latino, you are now a Mexican.
[00:09:16.746 --> 00:09:18.708]  Because that's the political decision.
[00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:21.552]  They want to play those groups off against each other.
[00:09:22.472 --> 00:09:24.834]  And so that's why I get so angry.
[00:09:24.834 --> 00:09:32.962]  98 miles into the U.S., I've never left the country on the trip, and I pull up with my family, and everybody on board, U.S.
[00:09:32.962 --> 00:09:34.383]  citizens.
[00:09:34.383 --> 00:09:43.291]  And you got a bunch of people with blue eyes and blonde and brown hair, speaking complete Texas accents, going, yeah, we're U.S.
[00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:44.132]  citizens.
[00:09:44.132 --> 00:09:46.474]  They go, pull over, we're searching.
[00:09:46.474 --> 00:09:48.056]  And I'm like, listen, I'm gonna sue you.
[00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:55.692]  Okay, you come on here without a warrant, and then they send over six goons, open the door up, and I explain.
[00:09:55.692 --> 00:10:01.614]  I go, the government's been caught dealing drugs, including the Border Patrol.
[00:10:01.614 --> 00:10:03.775]  And he said, the Supreme Court's ruled we can do this.
[00:10:03.775 --> 00:10:13.419]  And I said, it's ruled 100 miles in, and I believe it's a false ruling, but it's ruled that you can ask immigration status.
[00:10:13.419 --> 00:10:14.860]  You can ask if I'm a citizen or not.
[00:10:16.616 --> 00:10:18.437]  But I said, you're searching for drugs.
[00:10:18.437 --> 00:10:19.558]  He said, no, we're not.
[00:10:19.558 --> 00:10:22.640]  We're searching for narcotics.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.324]  And I looked at the guy, because they know they're outside the law.
[00:10:27.324 --> 00:10:29.245]  And I said, you come on here.
[00:10:29.245 --> 00:10:32.407]  I'm going to sue you, pal.
[00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:34.709]  I said, I do not give consent.
[00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:41.874]  The reason I got so mad yesterday, last time I had my camera going as we pulled up, and they said, turn that off.
[00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:45.076]  And I said, no, you're surveilling me, free speech, First Amendment.
[00:10:47.092 --> 00:11:01.722]  And then they came over and then they just, I opened the door of the RV we were on, the Info Wars mobile, and I talked to the guy and he said, you can go ahead and go.
[00:11:01.722 --> 00:11:11.389]  This time, six of them come over after they've ordered us to pull over, and they all kind of swagger over until I open the door and I'm getting their face with righteous indignation.
[00:11:13.464 --> 00:11:16.025]  And this time, I didn't hold the camera up.
[00:11:16.025 --> 00:11:26.667]  This time, you don't see the camera until, and I've got it down in my lap, until they start saying, no, we're gonna search your vehicle, we're coming aboard.
[00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:30.728]  And that's when I get the camera out, get in their face.
[00:11:30.728 --> 00:11:35.809]  And look, look, this is a planned takedown of America.
[00:11:36.977 --> 00:11:40.039]  The globalists always use the crisis they create.
[00:11:40.039 --> 00:11:54.831]  800 plus sanctuary cities, free tuition, free welfare, above the law, don't get arrested for DWI, don't get arrested for no insurance, get different banking rules, that's even been in the Associated Press, that the illegals get different banking rules than citizens.
[00:11:54.831 --> 00:12:02.997]  It's an incentive to bring them here, then turn them into a political group that will vote for gun control, open borders, basic globalism.
[00:12:05.939 --> 00:12:12.825]  And then as citizens of this country, see what's happening and get upset by it.
[00:12:12.825 --> 00:12:16.888]  Then the system comes in and says, that's okay.
[00:12:16.888 --> 00:12:22.533]  We will set up checkpoints everywhere in a police state.
[00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:26.296]  And then have a few show arrest every year.
[00:12:26.296 --> 00:12:28.418]  And then release the illegal aliens out the back door.
[00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:30.380]  I mean, this is all on record.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.042]  And there's six and a half plus billion people that want to come here.
[00:12:34.144 --> 00:12:35.486]  I mean, could we take them all?
[00:12:35.486 --> 00:12:37.869]  Maybe, if we didn't have welfare.
[00:12:37.869 --> 00:12:42.014]  But these groups do, on average, get on welfare.
[00:12:42.014 --> 00:12:47.340]  The dad goes out and works, but mama, on two or three different identification cards, gets on welfare.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.603]  That's why around Texas, you can tell the illegal aliens when you see them.
[00:12:51.603 --> 00:12:59.711]  Because they got a Western-wear dress, don't speak English, got LaRosa stickers all over their cars, and they're driving vehicles nicer than citizens are.
[00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:05.496]  Because they're not paying taxes on average, mom is on three forms of welfare, and daddy's out there working hard all day.
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.620]  And the babies are free at the hospital?
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.401]  Everything's free.
[00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:14.002]  And citizens, no matter what color you are, are subsidizing it.
[00:13:14.002 --> 00:13:16.182]  California's bankrupt.
[00:13:16.182 --> 00:13:17.122]  48 states are bankrupt.
[00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:19.043]  The country's going down right now.
[00:13:19.043 --> 00:13:21.463]  We're in a stalled depression.
[00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:25.944]  Mexico has been imploded by the globalists, which is designed to then drive them all up here.
[00:13:25.944 --> 00:13:27.604]  It's all been designed.
[00:13:27.604 --> 00:13:29.685]  Nobody's bad in this except the globalists.
[00:13:30.427 --> 00:13:38.189]  I don't blame Mexicans for wanting to come up here, especially now that it's a genocidal Mad Max world, literally, down in Mexico.
[00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:46.051]  And that's how Mexican citizens were describing it to me the five days I was down at the coast doing an investigation.
[00:13:46.051 --> 00:13:48.651]  That's what Hispanic Texans told me.
[00:13:48.651 --> 00:13:51.212]  That's what white and black Texans all told me.
[00:13:51.212 --> 00:13:55.453]  And they were all scared to talk on the radio except one gentleman.
[00:13:55.453 --> 00:13:59.174]  And he completely concurred, a Hispanic gentleman who we had on a few days ago.
[00:14:00.566 --> 00:14:00.946]  I don't know.
[00:14:19.642 --> 00:14:23.966]  Every time this happens, you're always told it's the first time it's happened.
[00:14:23.966 --> 00:14:26.989]  This is not the first time it's happened.
[00:14:26.989 --> 00:14:32.954]  It is in Tennessee and a surrounding four-state area that this happened in 2009.
[00:14:32.954 --> 00:14:36.378]  It's in my film, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[00:14:36.378 --> 00:14:38.700]  I had the state rep on.
[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.642]  The governor put out a statement.
[00:14:40.642 --> 00:14:43.865]  They had 14 federal agencies.
[00:14:43.865 --> 00:14:44.845]  This was in the newspapers.
[00:14:45.782 --> 00:14:55.489]  Fourteen federal agencies shutting up checkpoints on major highways, pulling families over, two hour long waits, shutting down entire highways.
[00:14:55.489 --> 00:15:01.314]  They're putting up the highway divider chains now, now to keep people from being able to flee.
[00:15:01.314 --> 00:15:05.937]  A total control grid is going into place for martial law, for continuity of government.
[00:15:05.937 --> 00:15:09.980]  They have resettlement specialists hired by the hundreds of thousands.
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.203]  They've got the camps built, Houston Chronicle.
[00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:14.324]  This is all going on.
[00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:18.269]  For the total depression they've engineered.
[00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:20.930]  The globalists have been gearing up for this for 15 years.
[00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.071]  But they always say it's the first time.
[00:15:23.071 --> 00:15:28.254]  This is going on in California, Texas, it's going on in every state.
[00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:43.862]  They have TSA checkpoints going back at least 8 years in Florida, 9 years, 10 years in D.C., Dallas about 5 years, Boston, Massachusetts, it's been going on everywhere.
[00:15:51.997 --> 00:15:52.662]  We're good.
[00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:03.461]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:15.753]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoodsDirect and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[00:16:15.753 --> 00:16:22.940]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.241]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:16:27.241 --> 00:16:29.582]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[00:16:29.582 --> 00:16:34.623]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.

[00:16:39.385 --> 00:16:41.045]  And go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:16:41.045 --> 00:16:41.386]  Call 24 hours, 800-409-5633.
[00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:53.550]  We're good to go.
[00:17:02.176 --> 00:17:06.180]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.443]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:17:09.443 --> 00:17:14.247]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:17:14.247 --> 00:17:20.633]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:22.876]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:17:23.396 --> 00:17:23.696]  Tim Geithner?
[00:17:23.696 --> 00:17:24.217]  Bernanke?
[00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:24.877]  They're arsonists!
[00:17:24.877 --> 00:17:26.158]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:17:26.158 --> 00:17:28.419]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:17:42.287 --> 00:17:46.673]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:17:46.673 --> 00:17:49.577]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:17:49.577 --> 00:17:58.709]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:03.647]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:08.949]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:18:08.949 --> 00:18:10.489]  Saving means to make money.
[00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:19.273]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:18:20.013 --> 00:18:27.555]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:18:27.555 --> 00:18:35.557]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:18:35.557 --> 00:18:40.779]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:42.939]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:18:51.306 --> 00:18:53.429]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[00:19:00.472 --> 00:19:05.015]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:19:05.015 --> 00:19:05.936]  Number 1.
[00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:09.358]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:10.219]  Number 2.
[00:19:10.219 --> 00:19:15.102]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:19:15.102 --> 00:19:15.862]  It's true.
[00:19:15.862 --> 00:19:20.726]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:19:20.726 --> 00:19:21.546]  Number 3.
[00:19:21.546 --> 00:19:25.128]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:19:25.128 --> 00:19:28.831]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:29.832]  Number 4.
[00:19:29.832 --> 00:19:32.595]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:19:32.595 --> 00:19:36.279]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:37.059]  Number 5.
[00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:41.224]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:19:41.224 --> 00:19:45.989]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:50.431]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:19:50.431 --> 00:19:52.212]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:19:52.212 --> 00:19:54.453]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:19:54.453 --> 00:19:57.075]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:19:57.075 --> 00:20:03.418]  Coast to Coast.
[00:20:03.418 --> 00:20:05.459]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:08.661]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:15.443 --> 00:20:31.874]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, if you want my view on the whole Muammar Gaddafi situation, it's this.
[00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:44.794]  With Bin Laden, we knew he had kidney failure 10 years ago or more.
[00:20:44.794 --> 00:20:52.697]  We know he was at the American hospital visited by the CIA, CBS News, Le Figaro of France.
[00:20:52.697 --> 00:20:56.898]  We know that his family was awarded giant contracts for U.S.
[00:20:56.898 --> 00:21:01.600]  military bases of the largest construction firm in the Middle East, Bin Laden Construction.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:06.622]  You know, to give you my view on this Qaddafi thing, I have to first give you some history.
[00:21:07.506 --> 00:21:16.871]  The Bin Laden thing was fake because we know Bin Laden was already dead from scores of credible sources, including Madeleine Albright, who came out and told Bush, don't roll him out dead.
[00:21:16.871 --> 00:21:18.972]  We know you've got him on ice.
[00:21:18.972 --> 00:21:22.473]  Walter Cronkite, you don't get more insider than that.
[00:21:22.473 --> 00:21:28.976]  He played footsie with the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, most elite encampment, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg, you name it.
[00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:31.918]  He came out right before the O4 election and said, don't bring him out.
[00:21:32.498 --> 00:21:34.879]  I had Bush administration official sources.
[00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:42.924]  I had Steve Pachinik, Counsel on Foreign Relations, back at the time saying it was all staged in 2002.
[00:21:42.924 --> 00:21:55.890]  So that we knew was fake and we said fake situation room photo, not live video feeds, throwing the body in the water, the way they had the media all ready to go with it and Obama making the announcement.
[00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:58.332]  That's when you know something's fake.
[00:21:58.332 --> 00:21:59.492]  That was fake.
[00:21:59.492 --> 00:22:00.313]  I don't know about this.
[00:22:01.804 --> 00:22:08.115]  The video has the customary super shaky and then there's one video still that they cut to.
[00:22:08.115 --> 00:22:09.797]  We're rolling the video right now.
[00:22:11.161 --> 00:22:17.967]  This person is either the worst camera person in the known galaxy, or this is a staged video.
[00:22:17.967 --> 00:22:22.731]  And we've seen staged videos out of Iran of a young woman shot and bleeding to death.
[00:22:22.731 --> 00:22:23.391]  That was fake.
[00:22:23.391 --> 00:22:25.153]  We've seen fake Bin Laden videos.
[00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:31.378]  The point is, when you have a government and a NATO system that lies incessantly, you don't know what the truth is.
[00:22:31.378 --> 00:22:35.362]  It's like if you have a neighbor or somebody in business you've worked with who lies most of the time.
[00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:37.540]  You never know.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.483]  So it's not bad to question this.
[00:22:40.483 --> 00:22:41.984]  In fact, you should.
[00:22:41.984 --> 00:22:49.653]  Knowing his psychology, knowing where he most likely would be in his own town, knowing about the month and a half long siege.
[00:22:49.653 --> 00:22:52.716]  They claim they killed him before or he ran to Venezuela.
[00:22:52.716 --> 00:22:54.518]  They claim they killed his sons over and over again.
[00:22:54.518 --> 00:22:55.299]  That wasn't true.
[00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.715]  They claim they killed his firstborn in the Shield of Islam.
[00:23:00.715 --> 00:23:02.797]  That's how it translates and they hadn't.
[00:23:02.797 --> 00:23:06.041]  So, I'd say 60-40, my gut.
[00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:10.185]  My gut says that's probably Qaddafi, he's probably dead.
[00:23:10.185 --> 00:23:15.792]  Just doing the MO, staying, fighting, seven months against the Al Qaeda rebels.
[00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:20.382]  It's kind of like, you know, he's the ugly, they're the bad.
[00:23:20.382 --> 00:23:23.563]  I'm not saying Qaddafi's a good guy, but it's good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:23:23.563 --> 00:23:26.165]  And the people running our country certainly aren't the good.
[00:23:26.165 --> 00:23:29.206]  And al-Qaeda certainly isn't the good.
[00:23:29.206 --> 00:23:30.646]  Or the ugly.
[00:23:30.646 --> 00:23:31.727]  They're the bad.
[00:23:31.727 --> 00:23:32.827]  So is Saudi Arabia.
[00:23:32.827 --> 00:23:41.131]  There's no doubting I'll take Qaddafi any day over Saudi Arabia and the unspeakable decadence and evil and British intelligence model they use.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:46.081]  It's true that he was a dictator.
[00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:47.362]  It's true he bucked the system.
[00:23:47.362 --> 00:23:49.724]  It's true he was building up all of Africa.
[00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:56.290]  It's true the guy lived in a little tent with plastic chairs, while everybody thought he was behind his armored compound.
[00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:57.751]  That's why they wanted to get rid of him.
[00:23:57.751 --> 00:24:00.253]  And now they're going to bring in the forced inoculations.
[00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:03.656]  They're going to cut off the water supply, the austerity.
[00:24:03.656 --> 00:24:05.838]  They have put al-Qaeda in control.
[00:24:05.838 --> 00:24:13.064]  They say thousands, upwards of 10,000 different types of missiles, several thousand shoulder-launched, have fallen into the hands of al-Qaeda.
[00:24:14.735 --> 00:24:20.453]  Think about this, put Al Qaeda in charge of Libya.
[00:24:21.721 --> 00:24:23.061]  Call them freedom fighters.
[00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:30.783]  Have the Facebook guy that ran the Arab Spring in Egypt overthrowing the old dictator, Mubarak, bringing in something far worse now.
[00:24:30.783 --> 00:24:35.764]  And then he's now running, with the CIA and State Department, the Occupy Wall Street situation.
[00:24:35.764 --> 00:24:39.085]  I want to get Wayne Madsen's take on that from waynemadsenreport.com.
[00:24:39.085 --> 00:24:42.265]  But I wanted to give you my preface first.
[00:24:42.265 --> 00:24:43.646]  I don't know what's going on here.
[00:24:43.646 --> 00:24:44.946]  People say, tell us, Alex.
[00:24:44.946 --> 00:24:45.326]  I don't know.
[00:24:47.914 --> 00:24:51.118]  Learning to judge from videos, they can fake almost anything.
[00:24:51.118 --> 00:24:55.443]  The Muttalib video was obviously fake with a hood over it.
[00:24:55.443 --> 00:24:57.705]  They just projected his head in and had him turn.
[00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:59.047]  That was clearly a fake.
[00:24:59.047 --> 00:25:01.389]  The Bin Laden videos turned out to be fake.
[00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:03.312]  I could look at them and tell you they were fakes.
[00:25:03.312 --> 00:25:07.837]  One of them was a standard computer-generated dummy model that you can get in even cheap programs.
[00:25:09.645 --> 00:25:14.409]  That was later confirmed with voice print and video analysis to be faked by major universities.
[00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:18.953]  This video, just looking at it with the eye, looks real.
[00:25:18.953 --> 00:25:21.335]  But their CG is getting better.
[00:25:21.335 --> 00:25:24.398]  They could have already killed him somewhere else and just want to release this.
[00:25:24.398 --> 00:25:25.399]  We don't know.
[00:25:25.399 --> 00:25:28.942]  He could have run to Uganda, and that's why special forces went in there.
[00:25:28.942 --> 00:25:30.143]  Then they drug his body back.
[00:25:31.172 --> 00:25:33.373]  We got Pachinik popping in later for 10 minutes on this.
[00:25:33.373 --> 00:25:37.154]  We got Tarpley popping in for 15-20 minutes or so.
[00:25:37.154 --> 00:25:40.376]  We have an article up at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:25:40.376 --> 00:25:45.337]  Killing Qaddafi spares international criminal court embarrassment for US and Britain.
[00:25:45.337 --> 00:25:51.120]  Like Milosevic, Qaddafi would have thrust Western support for al-Qaeda fighters under
[00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:52.692]  Spotlight.
[00:25:52.692 --> 00:26:08.945]  Now, one reason, you know, this whole intelligence mix that I think it could be staged, but my gut says probably not, is that you notice Europe didn't go along with the total private banker takeover and the end of all sovereignty being held hostage by the banksters.
[00:26:08.945 --> 00:26:10.446]  They didn't do that today.
[00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:12.128]  So all Hades is breaking loose there.
[00:26:12.868 --> 00:26:15.830]  Major states are banning cash sales like Louisiana.
[00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.091]  There's a lot of big police state developments.
[00:26:18.091 --> 00:26:20.452]  Checkpoints are popping up nationwide right now.
[00:26:20.452 --> 00:26:23.113]  We're going into another degree of martial law.
[00:26:23.113 --> 00:26:27.615]  So while all this is happening and that's coming up, we're busy looking at Qaddafi.
[00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:32.618]  Now a man who's been brave enough this year to be there, Tarpley's also was there just a few months ago under bombardment,
[00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:41.406]  He joins us to give us his first-look analysis of this Qaddafi situation.
[00:26:41.406 --> 00:26:43.288]  I haven't gotten your view yet, Wayne.
[00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:46.811]  You just heard my first-look analysis.
[00:26:46.811 --> 00:26:57.421]  What's your take as a former NSA analyst, Navy submarine warfare expert, top journalist reporting for some of the biggest publications in the world on Capitol Hill?
[00:26:58.121 --> 00:27:05.803]  As somebody that tracks what these disinfo people do, what's your gut-level first-look analysis, Wayne Madsen?
[00:27:05.803 --> 00:27:07.864]  Well, I also agree with you, Alex.
[00:27:07.864 --> 00:27:27.590]  I think, although it's too soon to tell, and because we've been inundated with all this disinformation before, curveballs, yellow-cake uranium, all these other fakes, you know, the riots in Syria that were actually riots in Bahrain, the fact that Al Jazeera was the first to report this,
[00:27:28.337 --> 00:27:33.620]  We know about their ties to the government of Qatar and what they've done with the CIA in the past.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:41.363]  My gut feeling says he's dead, but I also would point out initial reports were that he was shot in the legs.
[00:27:41.363 --> 00:27:45.025]  There was one photo I saw clearly of a head wound.
[00:27:45.025 --> 00:27:48.827]  It could be that he did try to maybe surrender, maybe they executed him.
[00:27:49.367 --> 00:27:54.831]  It doesn't say a whole lot for Obama's wall of the jungle of foreign policy, because that's what it is.
[00:27:54.831 --> 00:28:06.941]  It's no different than Bush's when we killed Saddam Hussein's two sons, and in a very macabre scene we saw them laid out on some slabs.
[00:28:07.722 --> 00:28:13.550]  Later we saw the photo purportedly of Saddam Hussein after he was executed.
[00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.353]  He still maintained he was president of Iraq.
[00:28:16.353 --> 00:28:19.718]  Qaddafi still maintained that he was the leader of Libya.
[00:28:19.718 --> 00:28:22.282]  I would say that as with Saddam Hussein,
[00:28:22.782 --> 00:28:23.362]  We're good to go.
[00:28:42.114 --> 00:28:52.227]  Uh, assisted in the assassination of a foreign head of state and Mr. Obama should be basically indicted by the House Judiciary Committee that's called impeachment.
[00:28:52.227 --> 00:28:54.831]  He should go before the Senate and he should be tried.
[00:29:01.414 --> 00:29:08.080]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:13.224]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:29:13.224 --> 00:29:21.951]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:29:21.951 --> 00:29:26.035]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:29:26.035 --> 00:29:28.397]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:42.246]  We turned jeans inside out.
[00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:44.026]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:29:44.026 --> 00:29:46.927]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:29:46.927 --> 00:29:51.148]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:29:51.148 --> 00:29:53.549]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:56.250]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.830]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.611]  Got it.
[00:29:58.611 --> 00:29:59.111]  Others don't.
[00:30:00.939 --> 00:30:04.902]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:30:04.902 --> 00:30:06.163]  Tyranny is here.
[00:30:06.163 --> 00:30:09.706]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:30:09.706 --> 00:30:12.329]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:30:12.329 --> 00:30:18.214]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:30:18.214 --> 00:30:24.419]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:30.802]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:30:30.802 --> 00:30:35.004]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:30:35.004 --> 00:30:39.307]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:30:39.307 --> 00:30:45.250]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.812]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:30:48.812 --> 00:30:50.793]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:30:50.793 --> 00:30:51.213]  It's here.

[00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:22.499]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[00:31:22.699 --> 00:31:26.823]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:31:26.823 --> 00:31:29.165]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[00:31:29.165 --> 00:31:33.989]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.

[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.661]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:52.985]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:52.985 --> 00:31:55.347]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:11.041 --> 00:32:16.424]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.424 --> 00:32:19.465]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.465 --> 00:32:21.786]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.786 --> 00:32:28.030]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:31.411]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.411 --> 00:32:32.812]  Recently, he created a video
[00:32:32.952 --> 00:32:33.172]  We're good.
[00:33:01.963 --> 00:33:05.546]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:11.291]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:16.996]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.996 --> 00:33:21.219]  It is Thursday, the 20th day of October 2011, and while the world is busy,
[00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:38.995]  Questioning whether Muammar Gaddafi is dead or not, like other fabled individuals, Osama Bin Laden.
[00:33:38.995 --> 00:33:41.978]  Big developments are taking place in the economy.
[00:33:41.978 --> 00:33:47.644]  We'll talk more about this coming up later in the hour with our guest after we cover some other issues.
[00:33:47.644 --> 00:33:50.087]  But here's CNBC.
[00:33:50.087 --> 00:33:53.210]  A long, steep drop for Americans' standard of living.
[00:33:54.121 --> 00:34:01.149]  And it breaks down that you've got to basically have higher taxes and no future under globalism to pay off the tens of trillions.
[00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:09.558]  Well, it's actually the thousand plus trillion in Ponzi scheme derivatives to the central banks.
[00:34:09.558 --> 00:34:10.999]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:11.760]  Here's another one.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.764]  A city group to pay millions to close a fraud complaint.
[00:34:16.505 --> 00:34:28.095]  Also, the Associated Press is reporting 70 plus trillion dollars in Bank of America derivatives secretly bailed out and backstopped.
[00:34:28.095 --> 00:34:32.359]  We're talking about 70 plus trillion for Bank of America and derivatives.
[00:34:32.359 --> 00:34:35.481]  The entire deficit isn't even 15 trillion.
[00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:36.402]  Okay?
[00:34:36.402 --> 00:34:41.987]  We'll get an idea of how they're inducing us through traders they control in government
[00:34:43.661 --> 00:34:45.543]  Having us sign on to their mega debt.
[00:34:45.543 --> 00:34:46.163]  It's incredible.
[00:34:46.163 --> 00:34:49.586]  I'll talk about that on the nightly news this evening.
[00:34:49.586 --> 00:34:51.848]  This is the most incredible article of the day.
[00:34:51.848 --> 00:34:57.913]  It's even bigger than checkpoints all over the country with TSA jerking families out of their cars we covered in the last hour.
[00:34:57.913 --> 00:35:01.155]  It's up on InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com.
[00:35:01.155 --> 00:35:06.200]  No, this is from KLFY with a straight face, they say.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:08.381]  Bans on cash!
[00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:11.184]  You're only allowed to use cash with major retailers.
[00:35:12.438 --> 00:35:17.522]  You cannot use cash for a second-hand sale.
[00:35:17.522 --> 00:35:21.265]  That includes all garage sales, swap meets, you know, you name it.
[00:35:21.265 --> 00:35:26.009]  This is directly out of the most horrific dictatorships ever seen.
[00:35:26.009 --> 00:35:27.010]  Cold hard cash.
[00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.671]  It's good everywhere you go, right?
[00:35:28.671 --> 00:35:30.833]  You can use it to pay for anything.
[00:35:30.833 --> 00:35:33.255]  But that's not the case here in Louisiana now.
[00:35:33.255 --> 00:35:36.418]  It's a law that passed during this year's busy legislative session.
[00:35:36.818 --> 00:35:43.381]  House Bill 195 basically says those who buy and sell second-hand goods cannot use cash to make those transactions.
[00:35:43.381 --> 00:35:45.001]  They want to kill the underground economy.
[00:35:45.001 --> 00:35:52.164]  That's why they're arresting people selling lemonade all over the country, or tomatoes, or pumpkins, and swat-teaming Amish.
[00:35:52.164 --> 00:35:54.285]  They're just selling milk to their neighbor.
[00:35:54.285 --> 00:35:56.226]  You are guilty until proven innocent.
[00:35:56.226 --> 00:35:58.507]  You can't be trusted in a cash economy.
[00:35:58.507 --> 00:35:59.927]  That's part of the 999 sales tax plan.
[00:36:03.237 --> 00:36:13.692]  That's where they now have a federal sales tax, and the Federal Reserve gets its way, and a VAT, where every transaction's tracked, and you swipe a card, even when you use cash, it's just gonna be a graduated sales tax.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.801]  And they go on to say that's the way it is.
[00:36:18.801 --> 00:36:21.003]  SWAT teams are standing by.
[00:36:21.003 --> 00:36:23.225]  And the checkpoints are being set up as well.
[00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:28.929]  And they're now saying citizens will now be on these Homeland Security pick-up lists, not arrest lists.
[00:36:28.929 --> 00:36:30.410]  You don't get a judge, you don't get a jury.
[00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:34.873]  They can kill you in secret under new federal edicts, not laws.
[00:36:34.873 --> 00:36:35.553]  They can kill U.S.
[00:36:35.553 --> 00:36:36.814]  citizens, that's been announced.
[00:36:36.814 --> 00:36:43.139]  And they just say, under the Enemy Combatant Act, you'll pull up to a checkpoint, you're on the list, you disappear, you're never seen again.
[00:36:44.147 --> 00:36:46.709]  And by the way, you never thought you'd get socialist healthcare.
[00:36:46.709 --> 00:36:48.250]  You never thought they'd ban cash.
[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.852]  Never thought they'd have federal checkpoints on the highways.
[00:36:50.852 --> 00:36:51.793]  It's here.
[00:36:51.793 --> 00:36:52.654]  It's all coming.
[00:36:52.654 --> 00:36:54.816]  It's the new world order.
[00:36:56.092 --> 00:36:59.395]  Never thought you'd see Mexican troops operating inside the U.S.
[00:36:59.395 --> 00:37:00.976]  It's the New World Order.
[00:37:00.976 --> 00:37:13.067]  Now, I'm really honored for the rest of the hour, the next 50 minutes, to be joined by John B. Wells, who is an accomplished composer, musician, writer, actor, martial arts instructor, and aviator.
[00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:21.815]  John B. Wells can be best described as a well-rounded Renaissance man who sabers the pursuit of knowledge and discovery from the arcane to the
[00:37:23.649 --> 00:37:25.410]  And it continues.
[00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:32.375]  Heard on radio and TV stations throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, South Africa, Australia, and South America.
[00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:35.458]  Wells is one of the world's most recognized voice artists.
[00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:45.064]  From network television programs to Lockheed Martin, Aeronautical Company, Joint Strike Fighter, F-22 Raptor projects, museum exhibits such as the Soviet Space
[00:37:46.325 --> 00:37:47.045]  Thanks a lot Alex.
[00:37:47.045 --> 00:37:51.146]  I'll tell you, I think that's the closest I'll ever come to an Academy Award.
[00:37:51.146 --> 00:37:51.406]  Thank you.
[00:38:13.231 --> 00:38:17.013]  And I should add, you're a host on Coast to Coast AM as well.
[00:38:17.013 --> 00:38:21.555]  That's the most fun job a guy could possibly have other than being on your show.
[00:38:21.555 --> 00:38:25.056]  Well, you know I'm a loud mouth who'll take up all the time, so let's get rolling here.
[00:38:25.056 --> 00:38:28.658]  What do you think of laws and moves around the U.S.
[00:38:28.658 --> 00:38:33.180]  to ban cash if you're not a big box globalist store?
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:41.084]  You know, Alex, I've spent so much time, people might wonder why would you want to talk to a voiceover guy, but I'll tell you very quickly, over the course of my career, I've been
[00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:45.807]  I mean, it's a blessing and a curse.
[00:38:45.807 --> 00:39:03.594]  If you subscribe to the theory that ignorance is bliss, I think maybe that's a correct statement, because I've read many, many things about various projects that I had to sign the paper on, many, many projects for what Dwight Eisenhower referred to as the military-industrial complex.
[00:39:03.594 --> 00:39:08.857]  And the fact is that this, in my opinion, is the first move toward the cashless society.
[00:39:09.697 --> 00:39:30.134]  And I suspect it'll only accelerate from here with all of this facial recognition being rolled out and iris scans and all this craziness with the TSA and now, of course, what more innocuous place to kick this off than in Louisiana under the auspices of being able to track, you know, the drug traffickers, you know?
[00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:32.817]  I've spent most of my life being under threat of some sort of a war.
[00:39:33.657 --> 00:39:44.830]  I was born around the time the Korean War ended, and then immediately after that we went into the Vietnam War, and then there was the war on poverty, and then there was the war on drugs, and now there's the war on terror.
[00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:49.495]  So I guess we're all war babies if we were, you know, born any time after World War II.
[00:39:49.495 --> 00:39:50.997]  And I don't see this getting better.
[00:39:50.997 --> 00:39:52.478]  I see it getting much worse.
[00:39:55.407 --> 00:39:58.591]  I think between, I don't know, maybe the Mayans have something.
[00:39:58.591 --> 00:40:05.520]  There's no telling how much damage can be caused in the next year and a couple of months, and I'm gravely concerned about it.
[00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:09.392]  Well, the government is acting like it's the end of the world.
[00:40:09.392 --> 00:40:13.174]  I mean, rolling out checkpoints, sticking their hands down our pants.
[00:40:13.174 --> 00:40:17.017]  They want to set the precedent for forced inoculations.
[00:40:17.017 --> 00:40:21.840]  They've openly promoted that with the Emergency Health Powers Act.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.203]  This is really frightening what this country is turning into.
[00:40:26.203 --> 00:40:32.347]  And then you look at the fact that globalism has de-industrialized our country.
[00:40:32.347 --> 00:40:36.170]  What's your view on this whole new world order system and where it wants to take us?
[00:40:37.851 --> 00:40:43.915]  Well, a friend, you may know him, a fellow named Mr. Vondo Gonzalez wrote a very interesting book.
[00:40:43.915 --> 00:40:49.760]  This is not my book, so I'm not hawking it, but it's called Psychological Warfare in the New World Order.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.422]  This is a really intensive book.
[00:40:53.422 --> 00:41:01.168]  And it's obvious, just like this, it's obvious that, you know, to quote a fictitious Home Secretary from one of my favorite shows,
[00:41:02.237 --> 00:41:08.424]  As I ease into my dotage, I find that timing is everything from lovemaking to the golf swing.
[00:41:08.424 --> 00:41:16.372]  And this taking down, this alleged taking down of Bin Laden followed by Anwar al-Awlaki and now finally with Gaddafi.
[00:41:16.372 --> 00:41:22.018]  It just seems that all of these things, of course, you know, al-Awlaki was a relatively recent player.
[00:41:23.587 --> 00:41:34.350]  But it appears that all of these little, like some sort of an infernal machine, or a tumbler on a safe, you get one click and you go back to the left.
[00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.430]  You can take that as the political left.
[00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:40.371]  You get another click, you go back to the right, you get another click, and then boom, the door opens.
[00:41:40.371 --> 00:41:44.032]  And the door, unfortunately, is the one that opens Pandora's box.
[00:41:44.032 --> 00:41:45.413]  It's escalating rapidly.
[00:41:45.413 --> 00:41:50.434]  In fact, I saw on your site today this Tyrell Corp, this one super corporation run the global economy.
[00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:56.634]  Once upon a time, we read the great books and we learned from those great books.
[00:41:56.634 --> 00:42:05.041]  Now, I think it's the great screenwriters that produce a lot of information that if we'll just allow ourselves to hear it.
[00:42:05.041 --> 00:42:11.125]  I mean, from little goofy things like this Operation Endgame, just a juvenile script.
[00:42:11.125 --> 00:42:20.473]  But if you look deeply into it, you'll see that there's a really much more serious thread of truth running through there, almost like, and I'll just wax silly for a minute,
[00:42:21.193 --> 00:42:29.438]  You know, as Bill was a great fan of comic books in that movie Kill Bill 2, I have been a fan of the Three Stooges.
[00:42:29.438 --> 00:42:34.901]  And in one of them, they have the Axis powers all gathered together, and one of them says, this is not right.
[00:42:34.901 --> 00:42:39.104]  Your minorities are infiltrating our majorities until you've made our majorities minorities.
[00:42:39.104 --> 00:42:43.066]  And of course, you know, Moe, who's playing Hitler, tells him to shut up and hits him with a golf club or something.
[00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:46.470]  Uh, this is, this is all, but, but it's true.
[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:56.281]  But then, which is why, just shifting gears, now if I warn you, I'll go a little bit ADD here, I think, uh, in the, in the mode of firing the short-barreled shotgun out the back door.
[00:43:02.378 --> 00:43:07.061]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:43:07.061 --> 00:43:13.484]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:43:13.484 --> 00:43:15.765]  Number one, study the past.
[00:43:15.765 --> 00:43:18.167]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:43:18.167 --> 00:43:21.889]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:43:23.004 --> 00:43:26.107]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:43:26.107 --> 00:43:29.950]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:38.999]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:42.422]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:43:42.422 --> 00:43:46.045]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:43:46.886 --> 00:43:51.834]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:43:51.834 --> 00:43:56.440]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.145]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:05.493]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:44:05.493 --> 00:44:09.116]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:44:09.116 --> 00:44:13.920]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:20.306]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:44:20.306 --> 00:44:22.569]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:44:23.089 --> 00:44:23.389]  Tim Geithner?
[00:44:23.389 --> 00:44:23.890]  Bernanke?
[00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:24.250]  They're arsonists!
[00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:25.030]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:27.352]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.290]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:58.402]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:45:02.301 --> 00:45:06.262]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:45:06.262 --> 00:45:15.124]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:45:15.124 --> 00:45:19.745]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:45:19.745 --> 00:45:30.567]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:40.710]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:46.132]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:45:46.132 --> 00:45:53.635]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:45:53.635 --> 00:45:56.036]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:46:00.336 --> 00:46:01.517]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:46:01.517 --> 00:46:08.441]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:46:08.441 --> 00:46:11.003]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:46:11.003 --> 00:46:16.387]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:46:16.387 --> 00:46:19.429]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:21.730]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:27.995]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:46:27.995 --> 00:46:28.435]  In fact,
[00:46:28.695 --> 00:46:29.355]  I don't know.
[00:46:49.767 --> 00:46:51.589]  End of America 3.com.
[00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:54.172]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:46:54.172 --> 00:46:58.057]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:46:58.057 --> 00:47:01.961]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:47:01.961 --> 00:47:03.483]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:03.483 --> 00:47:05.546]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:05.546 --> 00:47:08.749]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:18.988 --> 00:47:29.152]  I hope that you guys don't realize that Eternal Play just turned its back on here.
[00:47:29.152 --> 00:47:30.332]  It's 2am here.
[00:47:30.332 --> 00:47:32.813]  It's 2am and the theater is on.
[00:47:32.813 --> 00:47:33.113]  It's 2am.
[00:47:33.113 --> 00:47:34.174]  The show is still on.
[00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:43.749]  We are back live with syndicated talk show host, top voice talent, you name it, John B. Wells.
[00:47:43.749 --> 00:47:46.471]  And he's got another website, not just johnbwells.com.
[00:47:46.471 --> 00:47:49.833]  We'll tell you about that website here in just a moment.
[00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:53.755]  Before I go any further, I want to remind listeners that we are listener supported.
[00:47:53.755 --> 00:47:54.556]  Our sponsors...
[00:47:55.436 --> 00:48:01.261]  People that buy the books, the DVDs, the t-shirts, the films, all of it at InfoWars.com.
[00:48:01.261 --> 00:48:05.364]  Subscribers to InfoWars Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:05.364 --> 00:48:11.769]  This is how we've built this alternative media platform now reaching more than 10 million people a week.
[00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:19.958]  Conservatively, just on YouTube, that's about 25% of our audience is on, you know, stuff on the web like that.
[00:48:19.958 --> 00:48:25.685]  Several million a day on the radio, over a million a day with InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:25.685 --> 00:48:27.587]  Conservatively, we're reaching about...
[00:48:29.935 --> 00:48:34.419]  Conservatively, probably 20 million people a week now, one way or another.
[00:48:34.419 --> 00:48:37.902]  Millions a week just on the podcast, 600,000 a day.
[00:48:37.902 --> 00:48:41.786]  It's very, very, very exciting and it's only growing.
[00:48:41.786 --> 00:48:47.171]  And when each and every one of you spreads the word on Facebook, Twitter, tells your friends, your family, your neighbors about the show.
[00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.553]  I mean, I'm not risking my life for nothing.
[00:48:49.553 --> 00:48:52.795]  I know in my gut, I know historically we can beat these tyrants.
[00:48:52.795 --> 00:48:55.998]  This is a very nasty form of tyranny we've got growing.
[00:48:55.998 --> 00:48:58.840]  This whole scientific New World Order, it's got to be defeated.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.084]  We've got the new InfoWars, because knowing is half the battle, G.I.
[00:49:03.084 --> 00:49:04.265]  Joe-style shirt.
[00:49:04.265 --> 00:49:05.446]  Very, very popular.
[00:49:05.446 --> 00:49:07.627]  That's available at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:07.627 --> 00:49:12.051]  We've got all the In the Fed shirts on sale right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:12.051 --> 00:49:13.192]  People will ask, what is that?
[00:49:13.192 --> 00:49:15.294]  You can explain to them about the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:15.294 --> 00:49:15.994]  We have a new film.
[00:49:16.935 --> 00:49:21.058]  Only available in North America, because this is out of Europe, but it's in English.
[00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.739]  Very powerful, so I made a deal with them.
[00:49:22.739 --> 00:49:23.679]  I got a bunch of them.
[00:49:23.679 --> 00:49:29.703]  Scientists Under Attack, Genetic Engineering, and the facts that are coming out.
[00:49:29.703 --> 00:49:32.845]  We've got that new film available at Infowars.com.
[00:49:34.486 --> 00:49:39.589]  And when you purchase the books, the videos, all of it, it makes this show possible.
[00:49:39.589 --> 00:49:42.610]  But the most important thing is spreading the word.
[00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.691]  You know about the Federal Reserve situation.
[00:49:44.691 --> 00:49:52.375]  We're in contact with the Dallas Police Department about, I'm now talking to other witnesses that indeed there was a provocateur there trying to set us up.
[00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:56.518]  That shows that we're hurting them for them to go to those type of links.
[00:49:56.518 --> 00:50:00.940]  That the fact the Federal Reserve has filed complaints with YouTube trying to take down our videos.
[00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.241]  And YouTube didn't do it, by the way.
[00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:04.543]  Because we called them on it.
[00:50:04.543 --> 00:50:06.885]  Shows were hurting them.
[00:50:06.885 --> 00:50:08.626]  I mean, think about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:08.626 --> 00:50:11.929]  We're reaching tens of millions of people a week now.
[00:50:11.929 --> 00:50:13.651]  And it's only growing.
[00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:14.952]  And they can't really kill me.
[00:50:14.952 --> 00:50:15.793]  I mean, they may still.
[00:50:15.793 --> 00:50:17.134]  I get threats all the time.
[00:50:17.134 --> 00:50:19.316]  Because I'm nothing special.
[00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.778]  This information is out there now.
[00:50:21.934 --> 00:50:23.354]  I mean, go to the Drudge Report today.
[00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:25.575]  Lew Grodowski went and interviewed Alec Baldwin.
[00:50:25.575 --> 00:50:27.255]  He endorsed capitalism.
[00:50:27.255 --> 00:50:29.456]  That's up on the Drudge Report.
[00:50:29.456 --> 00:50:32.377]  Our article about the State Department running Occupy Wall Street.
[00:50:32.377 --> 00:50:33.477]  That's up on Drudge Report.
[00:50:33.477 --> 00:50:36.258]  Number one website in the world for news.
[00:50:36.258 --> 00:50:39.038]  Tens of millions a day.
[00:50:39.038 --> 00:50:40.339]  Truth is contagious.
[00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:41.779]  Truth is popular.
[00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:48.961]  And yes, for some of us that are out at the very tip of the spear, it's dangerous, but it's like the Braveheart line.
[00:50:50.976 --> 00:50:54.379]  Yes, we might go out on this battlefield and lose today.
[00:50:54.379 --> 00:50:59.544]  But what about many years from now, lying in our beds, about to die?
[00:50:59.544 --> 00:51:05.529]  What will we give to just come back here and tell our enemies, you can take our lives, but you can't take our freedom?
[00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:07.871]  I mean, it infuriates me to see this video.
[00:51:07.871 --> 00:51:09.012]  We're going to play a clip later.
[00:51:09.412 --> 00:51:15.479]  Of state police with Homeland Security and TSA looking at people on the highway like we're all guilty and criminals.
[00:51:15.479 --> 00:51:22.667]  Like we're being inducted into a prison and pulling people out of cars and searching vehicles without warrants because they're trying to stop terrorism.
[00:51:22.667 --> 00:51:25.411]  That should make you fight or flight.
[00:51:25.411 --> 00:51:28.594]  It should make you boil with disgust and concern.
[00:51:29.415 --> 00:51:32.417]  That we know where this leads 100% of the time.
[00:51:32.417 --> 00:51:34.838]  Going back to John B. Wells.
[00:51:34.838 --> 00:51:36.819]  John, I mean, you hear the point I'm making.
[00:51:36.819 --> 00:51:40.341]  You went to break making the point about it's all in time.
[00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:47.105]  You had gotten to the point where you had gotten to the point where you thought you would just stay invisible.
[00:51:47.105 --> 00:51:50.047]  Please continue where the break cut into what you were saying.
[00:51:50.047 --> 00:51:53.449]  And then let's get into some other subjects and also talk about your other website.
[00:51:54.326 --> 00:51:58.869]  Well, the thing is, Alex, I used to think invisibility was the key and just run away from it.
[00:51:58.869 --> 00:52:00.030]  There's no place to run.
[00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:01.691]  It will visit you wherever you are.
[00:52:01.691 --> 00:52:04.112]  So I just reversed myself on that.
[00:52:04.112 --> 00:52:05.673]  It's like visibility.
[00:52:05.673 --> 00:52:07.975]  High visibility is the key in that way.
[00:52:07.975 --> 00:52:09.396]  Look, we're all mortal.
[00:52:09.396 --> 00:52:10.877]  We're all going to check out of here one day.
[00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:13.779]  We're all going to begin the final boarding process out of this world.
[00:52:13.779 --> 00:52:22.184]  However, now is the time to stand for something or just cower like little mice and just let the cat take you over.
[00:52:22.184 --> 00:52:23.045]  That's what's going to happen.
[00:52:23.445 --> 00:52:42.055]  However, that said, with all this Occupy Wall Street, Occupy the Fed stuff, I'm beginning to wonder if the apparatus isn't so big and things are not so screwed up, if you will, and so far down the road that, I mean, revolution concerns me because if something like that were ever to happen,
[00:52:43.647 --> 00:52:49.892]  That's when our enemies would fall upon us, because they would see that as the weakest moment.
[00:52:49.892 --> 00:52:50.552]  To what end?
[00:52:50.552 --> 00:52:56.057]  I don't know, because, you know, at least in theory, the rest of the world relies on the United States for so much.
[00:52:56.057 --> 00:53:00.040]  If you'll just indulge me a second here, this came from Patrick Henry, and it's a short piece.
[00:53:01.118 --> 00:53:04.721]  But he said this was his speech on the Stamp Act, March 23rd, 1775.
[00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:07.803]  It is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope.
[00:53:07.803 --> 00:53:15.788]  We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.
[00:53:15.788 --> 00:53:19.871]  Is this the part of a wise man engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty?
[00:53:19.871 --> 00:53:28.437]  Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation?
[00:53:28.997 --> 00:53:37.185]  For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.
[00:53:37.185 --> 00:53:53.980]  You contrast that with George W. Bush, and I actually liked him until I got into it a little bit, and then I'm not so sure, who said, let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th, followed by Gore Vidal, who said, apparently conspiracy stuff is now shorthand for unspeakable truth.
[00:53:54.660 --> 00:54:13.219]  So, I'm just as jacked up and angry about this as you are, and you've been given your gift, I've been given mine, so if we can just bring some people, you don't have to obey us blindly or join our legions blindly, but at least listen and see how these events are affecting your lives.
[00:54:13.219 --> 00:54:13.960]  Bind together.
[00:54:15.201 --> 00:54:18.722]  Such a concerted effort is being made to drive us away from each other.
[00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:25.244]  Black against white, against brown, against Asian, against the federal people, the local people, the state people.
[00:54:25.244 --> 00:54:27.345]  We cannot allow this to happen.
[00:54:27.345 --> 00:54:30.366]  We have to be a nation, not just a country.
[00:54:30.366 --> 00:54:32.307]  Anyplace can be a country.
[00:54:32.307 --> 00:54:34.427]  We need to be a nation.
[00:54:34.427 --> 00:54:36.828]  And that's the end of my rant for the next few seconds anyway.
[00:54:37.312 --> 00:54:45.886]  Well, John beautifully said, and that's why the globalists are trying to break up our sovereignty and bring so many people in and then tell them, don't become Americans.
[00:54:45.886 --> 00:54:49.912]  No, keep your nationality so they can play us off against each other.
[00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:50.573]  That's the real...
[00:54:51.485 --> 00:54:56.047]  The real endgame, and look, people call it a revolution.
[00:54:56.047 --> 00:54:59.789]  I'm involved in an information warfare revolution against lies.
[00:54:59.789 --> 00:55:03.791]  But I've always said, I'm not a revolutionary, I'm a restorationist.
[00:55:03.791 --> 00:55:12.655]  Our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, though not fully lived up to in our country's history, was the greatest flower of renaissance and awakening.
[00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:19.656]  Enlightenment and I want to go forward to the past.
[00:55:19.656 --> 00:55:27.786]  I don't want to be a three four thousand year old thug run tyranny because we're going back before 1776 and 1789.
[00:55:27.786 --> 00:55:31.971]  We're going back to ancient tyranny with a high tech overlay.
[00:55:31.971 --> 00:55:32.492]  I want to go
[00:55:33.553 --> 00:55:37.656]  I want to go forward to the past, to the most advanced thing we've developed.
[00:55:37.656 --> 00:55:39.578]  I want to restore our republic.
[00:55:39.578 --> 00:55:48.565]  That's why when I pulled up to that checkpoint 98 miles into Texas, and they said we're going to search your car, I mean, I righteously had zero fear.
[00:55:48.565 --> 00:55:50.987]  And that actually scared me.
[00:55:50.987 --> 00:55:58.533]  After the fact, even though my little children were with me, I didn't care and didn't even have to pump myself up.
[00:55:58.533 --> 00:56:02.837]  I was so focused and so disgusted with these people that
[00:56:03.809 --> 00:56:08.010]  That at first they thought they scared me, you know, six border patrol guys around me.
[00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.070]  And it was the opposite.
[00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:13.472]  They, I said, I know the government brings in the drugs and I just totally hit them hard.
[00:56:13.472 --> 00:56:15.272]  I'll play it tonight on the nightly news.
[00:56:15.272 --> 00:56:21.514]  But my point is, is that, is that I have to make myself now try to even have some concern.
[00:56:21.514 --> 00:56:25.015]  I mean, because I still want to have that frostiness.
[00:56:25.015 --> 00:56:28.436]  It's like I'm getting, getting to where I have zero fear.
[00:56:28.436 --> 00:56:32.637]  And it's almost the extreme opposite of what a lot of people have.
[00:56:33.499 --> 00:56:35.741]  Do you get where I'm going here?
[00:56:35.741 --> 00:56:36.622]  Oh, I absolutely do.
[00:56:36.622 --> 00:56:53.861]  I mean, did I read that right the other week, that a 747, or I think that was actually the model number of the aircraft, full of cocaine, was allowed to come into this country in exchange for some cooperation against the Zetas, which, as you know, is made up of military deserters and other really hardcore guys.
[00:56:54.929 --> 00:57:06.281]  Yeah, and that's just their cover in the Texas newspapers that, oh, we let in this tonnage of cocaine, and yeah, Wachovia and Wells Fargo run these aircraft with cocaine, and yeah, I mean, it's totally controlled.
[00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:16.031]  And actually, the big banks in the US, not the US government, if you read all the federal documents that are admitted, they're funding all the cartels against each other to try to just keep prices up.
[00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:17.112]  It's so cold-blooded.
[00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:20.792]  And I don't know what the endgame is.
[00:57:20.792 --> 00:57:29.795]  I mean, if they did succeed in destroying the country, reducing us to some sort of a brawling, internally brawling third world nation, I mean, what is to be gained from this?
[00:57:29.795 --> 00:57:30.635]  I just don't know.
[00:57:30.635 --> 00:57:35.237]  I think it might go back to, I mean, I keep quoting movies, but again, it's the brilliant screenwriters.
[00:57:35.237 --> 00:57:35.977]  I think it's true.
[00:57:35.977 --> 00:57:44.740]  I don't think some of these people can be assigned any other motive or initiative other than they just like to see the world burn.
[00:57:51.087 --> 00:57:55.630]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:56.550]  Number 1.
[00:57:56.550 --> 00:57:59.973]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:57:59.973 --> 00:58:00.833]  Number 2.
[00:58:00.833 --> 00:58:05.716]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:58:05.716 --> 00:58:06.477]  It's true.
[00:58:06.477 --> 00:58:11.340]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:12.160]  Number 3.
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.743]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:58:15.743 --> 00:58:19.445]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:58:19.645 --> 00:58:20.445]  Number four.
[00:58:20.445 --> 00:58:23.206]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:58:23.206 --> 00:58:26.888]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:58:26.888 --> 00:58:27.688]  Number five.
[00:58:27.688 --> 00:58:31.830]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:36.872]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:58:36.872 --> 00:58:41.053]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:41.053 --> 00:58:42.834]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:58:42.834 --> 00:58:47.436]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:58:47.756 --> 00:58:50.818]  877-327-0365.
[00:58:50.818 --> 00:58:53.339]  You can bet your life on eFoods Direct.
[00:58:53.339 --> 00:59:05.626]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoods Direct and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:12.790]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:17.116]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:17.116 --> 00:59:19.459]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[00:59:19.459 --> 00:59:24.286]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient portable container.
[00:59:24.286 --> 00:59:25.007]  A $259 value for only $1.99.
[00:59:25.007 --> 00:59:25.107]  Save $60.
[00:59:29.113 --> 00:59:29.513]  I think so.
[00:59:52.034 --> 00:59:53.554]  Coast to coast.
[00:59:53.554 --> 00:59:55.615]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.615 --> 00:59:59.436]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:59:59.436 --> 01:00:06.377]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.377 --> 01:00:08.137]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.137 --> 01:00:09.918]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.918 --> 01:00:11.498]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.498 --> 01:00:13.038]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.038 --> 01:00:17.219]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.219 --> 01:00:21.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:27.474]  John B. Wells has been our guest for the last 50 minutes or so.
[01:00:27.474 --> 01:00:30.417]  He joins us in this first little segment of this hour.
[01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:33.060]  Then Webster Tarpley on the economy on Libya.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:33.900]  He joined us yesterday.
[01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:36.163]  He's popping back in today because of these big developments.
[01:00:36.163 --> 01:00:38.946]  He's recently been to Libya.
[01:00:38.946 --> 01:00:41.429]  We're talking again to John B. Wells.
[01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:41.629]  Look.
[01:00:43.263 --> 01:00:58.542]  Your survival instincts, all of your survival instincts are kicking in, but the mind control system will try to create a conscious fear so you will divert your own instinctive concerns into that.
[01:00:58.542 --> 01:01:01.045]  Go ahead, comment on that.
[01:01:02.597 --> 01:01:12.462]  Well, again, there's a psychological war that's being waged against us, and that's precisely what it is designed to do, is make you subservient to this coming system.
[01:01:12.462 --> 01:01:19.325]  I mean, that thing that George W. Bush said about, out of these troubled times, our objective, a new world order, can emerge today.
[01:01:19.325 --> 01:01:24.147]  That new world order is struggling to be born, a world quite different from the one we have known.
[01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:29.490]  You know, it's like somebody said one time, people will tell you they're bad intentions if you just allow yourself to hear it.
[01:01:30.709 --> 01:01:36.572]  And I think he said that they used the term New World Order over a hundred times in his administration.
[01:01:36.572 --> 01:01:39.874]  That's frightening in itself.
[01:01:39.874 --> 01:01:45.857]  But again, there's no doubt that this is an orchestrated effort.
[01:01:45.857 --> 01:01:48.839]  Look, it's undeniable.
[01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.319]  Nobody wants it.
[01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:55.002]  People just want to live their lives and go along, make a little money, enjoy their families, this and that, but this is what we've got to do.
[01:01:56.448 --> 01:02:03.353]  Well, instead of just pushing back to get them off our backs, we've got to route these parasite control freaks out.
[01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:17.061]  Just like when they try to tell people, you know, your grandpa in World War II veteran dies, and you go to the Houston VA Cemetery, one of the biggest in the country, and they say you can't have a priest or a pastor here to pray, you've got to get aggressive and go after them.
[01:02:17.061 --> 01:02:20.604]  In the federal court, first the Pentagon denied it, turned out they'd ordered it.
[01:02:21.264 --> 01:02:28.248]  Again, they're always behind the scenes trying to create basically a Soviet America for the bankers.
[01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:33.472]  They don't want freedom and they want to have population reduction and they want to shut down our free speech.
[01:02:33.472 --> 01:02:38.094]  That's why it's so important now to support alternative media more than ever.
[01:02:38.094 --> 01:02:45.399]  In closing, what's your view on the internet kill switch and FEMA coming up later this month, next month, testing takeover systems of radio?
[01:02:46.186 --> 01:02:53.294]  Well, it's just they're going to begin rubbing it in our faces now because we haven't been able to stop them from doing it, except in isolated cases.
[01:02:53.294 --> 01:02:57.138]  We haven't been able to stop them from invading our privacy.
[01:02:57.138 --> 01:03:08.170]  Just everybody keep in mind that while they are able to log every keystroke, every email, everything that you do is stored somewhere, including conversations on your cell phone.
[01:03:09.475 --> 01:03:15.639]  Uh, just remember something that an old Chicago criminal lawyer told me one time, who's recently passed away.
[01:03:15.639 --> 01:03:25.786]  Don't ever say anything over a phone or in an email or a text message that you wouldn't want repeated or played back in front of a federal grand jury.
[01:03:25.786 --> 01:03:27.568]  So just let discretion be your guide.
[01:03:28.368 --> 01:03:32.271]  But more than that, reconnect with your true character.
[01:03:32.271 --> 01:03:37.456]  Whatever that is, good character or bad character, pick a side.
[01:03:37.456 --> 01:03:38.757]  We're out of time.
[01:03:38.757 --> 01:03:40.018]  We're out of time.
[01:03:40.018 --> 01:03:41.980]  It's just about game time.
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.722]  So decide what side you're going to be on and go there.
[01:03:44.722 --> 01:03:49.626]  If you're going to be one of these people out there that says, I'm worth more than $7 an hour, you know, I'm not going to do anything.
[01:03:49.626 --> 01:03:50.727]  I want you to give it to me.
[01:03:51.187 --> 01:03:52.008]  Forget about it.
[01:03:52.008 --> 01:03:52.988]  You're not going to get it.
[01:03:52.988 --> 01:03:55.069]  The only thing that you're going to get is what you're given.
[01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:57.571]  You're not going to be able to make a life for yourself.
[01:03:57.571 --> 01:03:59.212]  It's going to be made for you.
[01:03:59.212 --> 01:04:00.133]  And then what?
[01:04:00.133 --> 01:04:02.014]  You're assigned an apartment.
[01:04:02.014 --> 01:04:06.136]  You're assigned a little card as to whether or not you can even drive a car.
[01:04:06.136 --> 01:04:10.759]  If that's the life you want, just sit there and do nothing otherwise.
[01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:13.701]  Participate in this great event.
[01:04:14.401 --> 01:04:16.323]  Put this thing back like it was.
[01:04:16.323 --> 01:04:18.865]  Nobody has improved upon the wheel.
[01:04:18.865 --> 01:04:21.047]  There are always going to be injustices overcome.
[01:04:21.047 --> 01:04:22.168]  Work on that.
[01:04:22.168 --> 01:04:25.170]  But for God's sake, hold on to the foundation.
[01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:28.513]  And that foundation is the United States Constitution.
[01:04:28.513 --> 01:04:35.519]  That is what has enabled us to do what no other nation or combination of nations have been able to do in 235 years.
[01:04:35.519 --> 01:04:41.404]  If you're 50 years old, you've been alive more than 20% of the time that this nation has even been in existence.
[01:04:41.784 --> 01:04:43.085]  Be part of it.
[01:04:43.085 --> 01:04:43.766]  Be part of it.
[01:04:43.766 --> 01:04:51.311]  Breathe life back into the spirit of 1776 and liberty or bow your knee to total tyranny and submit to being a slave.
[01:04:51.311 --> 01:04:53.413]  John B. Wells, incredible interview.
[01:04:53.413 --> 01:04:54.834]  Can't wait to have you back.
[01:04:54.834 --> 01:04:56.095]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:04:56.095 --> 01:04:57.256]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:04:57.256 --> 01:04:57.776]  It was a pleasure.
[01:04:57.776 --> 01:04:58.957]  It was a pleasure having you.
[01:04:58.957 --> 01:04:59.398]  Amazing.
[01:05:01.468 --> 01:05:03.170]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:08.477]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:08.477 --> 01:05:10.020]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:18.831]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:19.532 --> 01:05:27.074]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:27.074 --> 01:05:35.076]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:35.076 --> 01:05:42.458]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:50.641]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:05:50.641 --> 01:05:53.263]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:22.347 --> 01:06:27.212]  It is Friday, the 21st day of October 2011.
[01:06:27.212 --> 01:06:30.055]  We are going to be live here for the next three hours.
[01:06:31.311 --> 01:06:39.780]  Naomi Wolf who was arrested at Occupy Wall Street will give us her perspective in a brief interview coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:50.852]  We'll get her take on it as a Rhodes Scholar and as an establishment leftist who has criticized the police state of George W. Bush and now of Barack Obama.
[01:06:50.852 --> 01:06:52.093]  She's one of the more
[01:06:53.294 --> 01:06:54.735]  Fair people out there.
[01:06:54.735 --> 01:06:58.696]  So we want to get her perspective on it.
[01:06:58.696 --> 01:07:01.778]  The bestselling author joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:01.778 --> 01:07:07.360]  We got Bob Chapman popping in as he does every Friday on the big economic developments in Europe and around the world.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:14.583]  The admission now that this country by more and more economists is in a depression, never left the deep recession.
[01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:17.444]  And this is an engineered implosion of our society.
[01:07:17.444 --> 01:07:19.645]  We'll also talk with Bob about the 79 trillion
[01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:24.347]  That's in even USA Today and Reuters.
[01:07:24.347 --> 01:07:25.707]  Bloomberg broke it two days ago.
[01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:29.288]  I know I've been mentioning it the last few days because it's a big deal.
[01:07:29.288 --> 01:07:42.212]  $79 trillion in additional derivatives now that has been moved over to the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation.
[01:07:42.212 --> 01:07:48.634]  And William K. Black, the former top federal regulator that prosecuted a lot of these crooks in the last round 15 years ago,
[01:07:49.594 --> 01:07:55.896]  He's come out and said this will be the destruction of Bank of America, and with it, the U.S.
[01:07:55.896 --> 01:07:56.396]  economy.
[01:07:56.396 --> 01:08:02.578]  They're going to sign us on to $79 trillion.
[01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:06.339]  And they're going to have Herman Cain on the fake right pushing 9999999.
[01:08:06.339 --> 01:08:08.160]  In fact, there's an article out today.
[01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:14.045]  It's up at Infowars.com.
[01:08:14.045 --> 01:08:22.497]  Peter Schiff of Europacific Capital, I'm going to work on him, getting him on the nightly news tonight, saying the hidden nine of Herman Cain.
[01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:24.260]  That's right, because there's the 9%
[01:08:26.192 --> 01:08:26.312]  That's
[01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:46.894]  26, 27 an hour.
[01:08:46.894 --> 01:08:48.935]  But that money's paid to the government.
[01:08:48.935 --> 01:08:51.936]  Not counting the money they then take out of your check on top of it.
[01:08:51.936 --> 01:08:56.758]  See, it's all this hidden taxation you don't see till you actually write the checks.
[01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.119]  I write the checks.
[01:08:58.119 --> 01:08:59.139]  I see it all.
[01:08:59.139 --> 01:09:06.462]  And a lot of people say, Alex, you ought to just tell the IRS that's private and, you know, works with a private fellow reserve to go to Hades.
[01:09:06.462 --> 01:09:09.043]  We pick our battles here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:09.043 --> 01:09:10.444]  The federal courts have a 98% conviction rate.
[01:09:13.544 --> 01:09:21.426]  Federal courts sentenced black people to death 160, 70 years ago who ran away from their plantations.
[01:09:21.426 --> 01:09:23.927]  So I'm going to pick my battles.
[01:09:23.927 --> 01:09:27.588]  They have rigged juries, total criminals running them.
[01:09:27.588 --> 01:09:28.969]  Most of them on the take.
[01:09:28.969 --> 01:09:35.231]  Most of the government is criminal narcotics traffickers or paid by that 500 billion a year they used to pay their criminal army.
[01:09:35.851 --> 01:09:51.315]  And so I follow all the fake rules, all the fake laws, all the fake garbage, so I can be 100% strong and up front here covering real information.
[01:09:52.456 --> 01:10:20.641]  Now I do confront naked body scanners I do confront internal checkpoints and get in the police face and say no to that because it's an absolute clear and present hardcore manifestation of classical tyranny But when you get down to the Kingsmen and the taxation system That is something that we we we we we languish under but I'm now digressing The point is
[01:10:23.288 --> 01:10:30.691]  That the globalists are basically exempt from taxation and regulation.
[01:10:30.691 --> 01:10:45.556]  And they want to jack up taxes now to pay down the derivatives bubble that they've had their operatives, that they spent decades getting into every power position and every regulatory position at the SEC, Congress, Federal Reserve, and Treasury.
[01:10:48.633 --> 01:10:50.254]  And they're dropping the hammer.
[01:10:50.254 --> 01:10:53.277]  They always intended to saddle us with their debt.
[01:10:53.277 --> 01:11:10.869]  They bought the world through fraud with the Ponzi money, but then, holding the world hostage, they bring us fully under their economic control and give the private banks governance powers, as is now happening with the super congress here in the US, as is now happening with the Euro takeover in Europe.
[01:11:10.869 --> 01:11:11.350]  It's here.
[01:11:11.850 --> 01:11:20.376]  Full bankster occupation, full domination, the end of America, the end of liberty, total tyranny.
[01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:31.204]  And a physical oppression with domestic police, domestic secret police, domestic federal police, local police, federalized deputies, spying threat fusion centers.
[01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.906]  They're in the news now admitting what we've known for 20 years.
[01:11:33.906 --> 01:11:37.889]  The Pentagon's got ground penetrating radar looking through all your walls.
[01:11:37.889 --> 01:11:39.811]  The police departments are getting trucks now.
[01:11:40.151 --> 01:11:48.558]  That look right through your walls and also blast you with high powered radiation and radio waves, sound waves.
[01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:51.300]  There's a bunch of different types of systems they have.
[01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:52.701]  That's in mainstream media today.
[01:11:52.701 --> 01:11:55.684]  They're just getting ready to tell the slaves about it.
[01:11:55.684 --> 01:11:59.307]  Again, they're reporting checkpoints all over the country.
[01:11:59.307 --> 01:12:05.092]  They're just going to continue to roll it out, roll it out, roll it out, and flaunt it in your face.
[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:08.312]  Just Sunday, it happened again.
[01:12:08.312 --> 01:12:11.094]  100 mile, 98 mile into the country checkpoint.
[01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:16.980]  I'm going to play that video later in audio here from what happened Sunday.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:24.607]  Because it integrates in with all this TSA checkpoint news that's in mainstream newspapers and TV stations.
[01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:26.329]  And they're like, we're going to search your vehicle.
[01:12:27.592 --> 01:12:28.733]  98 miles into the U.S.
[01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:32.696]  and I said, this is a violation of my Fourth Amendment.
[01:12:32.696 --> 01:12:34.537]  And they said, the Supreme Court has ruled.
[01:12:34.537 --> 01:12:37.759]  And I said, the Supreme Court has ruled you can check immigration status.
[01:12:37.759 --> 01:12:40.361]  The Supreme Court has also ruled black people weren't humans.
[01:12:40.361 --> 01:12:43.863]  So I don't want to hear it, but I said, you are here with a drug dog.
[01:12:43.863 --> 01:12:46.925]  And you know they haven't ruled you can have drug checkpoints.
[01:12:46.925 --> 01:12:49.527]  And they know that, they know it's illegal.
[01:12:49.527 --> 01:12:52.189]  They know it's official oppression and a civil rights violation.
[01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:54.851]  He says, I'm not looking for drugs, I'm looking for narcotics.
[01:12:57.222 --> 01:13:08.469]  So that's the first thing I want to get into today, but coming up, Union President testifies ICE, and I have the C-SPAN clip, ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest illegals, including fugitives.
[01:13:08.469 --> 01:13:17.135]  You know, I'd say, I don't know, I haven't really ever counted it up, but I'd say about 40% of my crew here at the office is Hispanic.
[01:13:19.658 --> 01:13:20.819]  I don't know.
[01:13:40.539 --> 01:13:41.980]  And it's incredible.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.902]  So this has nothing to do.
[01:13:43.902 --> 01:13:49.206]  They do some show arrest of illegals here and there at a meatpacking plant that isn't part of the inside group.
[01:13:49.206 --> 01:13:53.590]  Or they'll do a raid on a Walmart once and it came out, then give them green cards.
[01:13:53.590 --> 01:13:55.171]  That came out in the news again yesterday.
[01:13:55.171 --> 01:13:56.312]  CNS News had that.
[01:13:57.486 --> 01:13:59.608]  This is all coming out in Congress.
[01:13:59.608 --> 01:14:13.398]  And so they want to search my car, and I'm like, the Border Patrol's been caught in Fast and Furious shipping drugs in, guns out, with the ATF, FBI, and what, six other, it's eight agencies total.
[01:14:13.398 --> 01:14:16.140]  So five other agencies on top of those three.
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:17.561]  And I said, the game's over, bud.
[01:14:18.599 --> 01:14:20.821]  I don't use your products.
[01:14:20.821 --> 01:14:24.484]  I'm not the government that brings the drugs in here, and you're not going to do this.
[01:14:24.484 --> 01:14:29.828]  Folks, they're getting ready under the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act.
[01:14:29.828 --> 01:14:30.969]  This is admitted.
[01:14:30.969 --> 01:14:33.572]  They're getting you used to government putting their hands on you.
[01:14:33.572 --> 01:14:34.592]  You've never been to jail.
[01:14:34.592 --> 01:14:36.854]  You're not a criminal.
[01:14:36.854 --> 01:14:43.420]  You know, you get up and about, you know, a cop walking over and asking you questions at the shopping mall or wherever, you're like, why are you doing that?
[01:14:44.639 --> 01:14:51.665]  You're informed historically, you know that's what happens in third world countries, in Soviet, you know, Russia, places like that.
[01:14:51.665 --> 01:15:03.776]  They're just breaking the ice, getting you used to blood draws at checkpoints, federalization of police, the feds at checkpoints, the feds at proms now.
[01:15:03.776 --> 01:15:07.740]  The feds at the prom now.
[01:15:10.023 --> 01:15:11.945]  This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:18.950]  This is right out of central casting of a corrupt, oppressive, North Korean-style system.
[01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:24.174]  This is the social engineers 100% consciously.
[01:15:24.174 --> 01:15:28.597]  They've announced every airport in the US, every major airport, will get naked body scanners.
[01:15:28.597 --> 01:15:31.900]  And now Austin's getting them next month.
[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.962]  And they're saying everyone will be forced through them.
[01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:40.003]  The TSA said in the Chicago Tribune, they said we will force everyone starting next year.
[01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:43.366]  So first it's opt-out, opt-out, embarrass you, grab on you.
[01:15:43.366 --> 01:15:46.389]  While the idiot TSA says they're frying themselves.
[01:16:03.223 --> 01:16:05.365]  We're subject to public police action.
[01:16:05.365 --> 01:16:06.626]  Tyranny is here.
[01:16:06.626 --> 01:16:10.389]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:16:10.389 --> 01:16:12.791]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:17.956]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:16:18.656 --> 01:16:25.320]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:31.303]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:16:31.303 --> 01:16:34.925]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:16:35.465 --> 01:16:39.769]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:16:39.769 --> 01:16:45.713]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:16:45.713 --> 01:16:49.256]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:51.237]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:16:51.237 --> 01:16:52.358]  It's here.

[01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:22.092]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:17:22.092 --> 01:17:26.153]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:27.091]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.

[01:18:58.519 --> 01:19:17.071]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:19:17.071 --> 01:19:20.754]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:41.797]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.

[01:20:02.108 --> 01:20:08.912]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:10.736 --> 01:20:13.503]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:20:13.503 --> 01:20:16.331]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:32.842 --> 01:20:40.572]  Okay, I want to go to Eric, Tim, Jeff, Robert, Keith, and many others that are patiently holding on this live Friday edition.
[01:20:40.572 --> 01:20:45.057]  But first, I want to get into treason.
[01:20:45.057 --> 01:20:51.205]  As you know, it has come out yet again in congressional testimony, and we covered this yesterday.
[01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:55.421]  The Associated Press carried it, so did CNS News.
[01:20:55.421 --> 01:21:01.625]  Napolitano testified, DHS is authorizing illegal aliens to work in the U.S.
[01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:09.089]  They've been hired to build part of the border fence when they do do raids on dairies and meat packing plants.
[01:21:09.089 --> 01:21:12.992]  In every case, they hire them all on the spot and give them green cards.
[01:21:12.992 --> 01:21:14.372]  It's all for public consumption.
[01:21:15.553 --> 01:21:24.302]  Here's a headline Union President testifies ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest illegals including fugitives.
[01:21:24.302 --> 01:21:27.325]  Now we've heard the Border Patrol come out with this information for years.
[01:21:27.325 --> 01:21:34.813]  We've heard sheriffs come out where they'll arrest a truckload of 10, 15 illegals or more and be ordered to turn them loose.
[01:21:34.813 --> 01:21:35.854]  But then citizens
[01:21:37.119 --> 01:21:39.321]  Get the book thrown at you and they want to search your car.
[01:21:39.321 --> 01:21:43.024]  It's all about using the excuse to invade your life.
[01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:46.287]  I'm not an enemy of the Border Patrol.
[01:21:46.287 --> 01:21:51.791]  Okay, I'm just upset over the fact that they're being used to do unconstitutional things.
[01:21:51.791 --> 01:21:56.696]  And we have that video clip coming up here in just a moment.
[01:21:56.696 --> 01:22:03.842]  But you add all of this together with an article like this one, and this is just coming out today.
[01:22:03.842 --> 01:22:05.063]  I see this stuff every day.
[01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:12.031]  But this is unprecedented because it's Janet Napolitano admitting it in testimony.
[01:22:12.031 --> 01:22:13.191]  And here's the issue.
[01:22:13.191 --> 01:22:15.372]  Federal law is still there.
[01:22:15.372 --> 01:22:16.432]  You aid and abet.
[01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:34.320]  In fact, when I was down in South Padre, I was talking to a business owner, and I actually looked it up, the story he told me about, where one of the owners of the sightseeing boats and dolphin watching and fishing boats, he owned a bunch of them,
[01:22:35.513 --> 01:22:39.154]  And he basically had bought up a lot of the town over decades running it.
[01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:45.757]  He got caught using one of his big boats to bring illegals into Houston, 100 miles north of there or so.
[01:22:45.757 --> 01:22:50.098]  And he got a year in prison and they took all his boats and stuff.
[01:22:50.098 --> 01:22:52.179]  Well, that's just because he was a small fry.
[01:22:52.179 --> 01:22:56.280]  You see, violating that federal law was a felony.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.842]  But they're saying because Obama is the president, he can violate federal laws.
[01:23:01.842 --> 01:23:03.263]  He can order citizens killed.
[01:23:04.565 --> 01:23:06.006]  Oh, but it's just Al-Qaeda.
[01:23:06.006 --> 01:23:08.567]  The precedent's now set.
[01:23:08.567 --> 01:23:11.228]  They say you're Al-Qaeda.
[01:23:11.228 --> 01:23:14.450]  The precedent's now set to set up checkpoints all over the country.
[01:23:14.450 --> 01:23:18.051]  In fact, I have those reports I'm going to get to here in a moment.
[01:23:18.051 --> 01:23:19.792]  But here's another report out of Fox News.
[01:23:19.792 --> 01:23:25.755]  Senators have drafted a bill to give visas to foreigners buying pricey homes.
[01:23:25.755 --> 01:23:28.436]  And I'm not so much even against that if foreigners come with money.
[01:23:28.436 --> 01:23:30.777]  I mean, that's the issue.
[01:23:30.777 --> 01:23:32.438]  If people come here and get put on welfare,
[01:23:34.179 --> 01:23:39.245]  And then the Forge Foundation teaches them to hate America and to vote for gun control.
[01:23:39.245 --> 01:23:45.332]  I mean, you've got to keep the illegals out or they're going to become the majority and vote to take all our liberties away.
[01:23:45.332 --> 01:23:46.073]  Don't you get it?
[01:23:46.073 --> 01:23:48.496]  That's why the megacorporations are for it.
[01:23:48.496 --> 01:23:50.097]  It's not just about driving down wages.
[01:23:52.079 --> 01:23:54.861]  That 500,000 isn't quite nearly enough.
[01:23:54.861 --> 01:23:57.523]  It should at least be a million.
[01:23:57.523 --> 01:24:04.749]  And that you guarantee that you're going to be able to get a job, you got a job waiting for you, or that you're not going to ever seek welfare.
[01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:12.755]  And sign a form, sign an agreement, that if you're going to move here for 10 years, you don't get any free largess.
[01:24:12.755 --> 01:24:14.637]  There's 310 million Americans.
[01:24:14.637 --> 01:24:17.399]  There's almost 7 billion people outside the country.
[01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:24.509]  The census is 7 billion globally, but that was a couple years ago, and it's not entirely accurate to estimate.
[01:24:24.509 --> 01:24:25.190]  It's more like 7,200,000,000.
[01:24:25.190 --> 01:24:34.215]  So there's 6.9 billion people that want to come here.
[01:24:34.215 --> 01:24:36.356]  Well, they won't want to come here very soon if they all get here.
[01:24:36.356 --> 01:24:38.938]  I mean, have you been to a real third world country, folks?
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:45.022]  All these people saying, oh, like Perry, let's give the lowest tuition that's taxpayer-supported.
[01:24:45.022 --> 01:24:48.063]  50% of it at least is paid for by taxpayers.
[01:24:48.063 --> 01:24:52.005]  Let's give in-state tuition, taxpayer-subsidized to the illegals.
[01:24:52.005 --> 01:24:54.846]  You don't have a big heart if you don't.
[01:24:54.846 --> 01:24:56.266]  A big heart?
[01:24:56.266 --> 01:24:58.827]  Most people I know can't afford to send their kids to college.
[01:24:58.827 --> 01:24:59.528]  Who are citizens?
[01:24:59.528 --> 01:25:01.008]  Forget what color they are.
[01:25:01.008 --> 01:25:02.749]  But the illegals, they do.
[01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:07.834]  I mean, this is such a game how they use the big heart of the American people.
[01:25:07.834 --> 01:25:12.899]  Can you go to Mexico or Nicaragua or El Salvador or South Korea?
[01:25:12.899 --> 01:25:18.044]  Can you go anywhere and get free education or close to it?
[01:25:18.044 --> 01:25:18.704]  No, of course not.
[01:25:18.704 --> 01:25:20.386]  You get arrested.
[01:25:20.386 --> 01:25:21.647]  But I digress.
[01:25:21.647 --> 01:25:26.131]  This is the ridiculous mind game the globalists have pulled on us.
[01:25:27.523 --> 01:25:37.791]  The good news is, despite all his claims of being a man of peace, because he's going to pull all the troops out when there's over 100,000 contractors and they're just renaming the troops as non... It's the same trick from two years ago.
[01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:40.193]  They're renaming the troops as non-military.
[01:25:40.193 --> 01:25:45.417]  They're still troops, but it's in a logistics support role.
[01:25:45.417 --> 01:25:46.938]  You didn't read the fine print, huh?
[01:25:46.938 --> 01:25:48.800]  More mind games.
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.342]  Just like they were going to be out of Afghanistan in one year, huh?
[01:25:52.342 --> 01:25:52.903]  Ten years later.
[01:25:55.779 --> 01:26:05.063]  Then you look at Obama's jobs bill, and it admittedly has a free trade deal that's one-sided to move jobs to Latin America and South Korea.
[01:26:05.063 --> 01:26:06.424]  That's the jobs bill.
[01:26:06.424 --> 01:26:07.844]  But wait!
[01:26:07.844 --> 01:26:09.405]  It gets worse.
[01:26:09.405 --> 01:26:10.825]  Let me find it here in my stack.
[01:26:10.825 --> 01:26:12.546]  I already read it earlier.
[01:26:12.546 --> 01:26:14.387]  I already read the headline earlier.
[01:26:18.271 --> 01:26:21.233]  Oh boy, I can't even keep track of all this.
[01:26:21.233 --> 01:26:27.156]  Guys, pull up the headline, General Electric profits increased 57% for me.
[01:26:27.156 --> 01:26:33.760]  So I can read that off the screen and also show that to listeners out there.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:39.284]  Point it out for people, thank you, because I can't seem to find it.
[01:26:39.284 --> 01:26:41.985]  Here in my stack, there's just too much.
[01:26:41.985 --> 01:26:44.187]  The point is, General Electric
[01:26:45.387 --> 01:26:56.435]  Is runs the President's Economic Board, and they have publicly stated they're going to move their x-ray division overseas.
[01:26:56.435 --> 01:27:06.582]  General Motors, with billions of dollars it was given, over $5 billion total, moved plants to Brazil, Eastern Europe, and China.
[01:27:06.582 --> 01:27:11.786]  Your tax money paid to move it out of the country.
[01:27:15.253 --> 01:27:30.385]  But before we get to that, let's go ahead and play that clip from C-SPAN, where the head of the union admits that ICE was ordered to let illegal aliens stay in the country, including criminals.
[01:27:30.385 --> 01:27:30.946]  Here's that clip.
[01:27:32.342 --> 01:27:52.708]  When I last testified before this subcommittee on July 25, 2011, I reported, among other things, that ICE enforcement removal officers and agents in the field alleged that unwritten directives from ICE headquarters had been issued nationwide ordering officers not to arrest aliens unless it was confirmed that the alien had received a prior conviction for a criminal offense.
[01:27:53.931 --> 01:28:08.643]  Aliens who could not be arrested included, but were not limited to, ICE fugitives who had been ordered deported by a federal immigration judge, as well as aliens who had illegally re-entered the United States after deportation, a federal felony.
[01:28:08.643 --> 01:28:22.495]  ICE officers and agents also alleged that they were not permitted to arrest or even speak to confirmed or suspected illegal aliens encountered in the field during operations and were prohibited from running standard criminal records checks for wants and warrants.
[01:29:02.639 --> 01:29:07.322]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:29:07.322 --> 01:29:13.747]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:29:13.747 --> 01:29:16.028]  Number one, study the past.
[01:29:16.028 --> 01:29:18.430]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:22.153]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:26.361]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:29:26.361 --> 01:29:30.202]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:29:30.202 --> 01:29:39.245]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:29:39.245 --> 01:29:42.667]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:29:42.667 --> 01:29:46.288]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:52.071]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:29:52.071 --> 01:29:56.693]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:29:56.693 --> 01:29:59.395]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:02.045 --> 01:30:03.747]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.747 --> 01:30:09.074]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:09.074 --> 01:30:10.597]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.597 --> 01:30:19.388]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:20.129 --> 01:30:27.650]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.650 --> 01:30:35.652]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.652 --> 01:30:40.873]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:30:40.873 --> 01:30:43.053]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:31:00.666 --> 01:31:01.846]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:31:01.846 --> 01:31:08.768]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:08.768 --> 01:31:11.329]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:11.329 --> 01:31:16.710]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:19.751]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:19.751 --> 01:31:22.051]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:22.051 --> 01:31:28.313]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:31:28.313 --> 01:31:28.753]  In fact,
[01:31:29.013 --> 01:31:31.694]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:31.694 --> 01:31:37.475]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:31:37.475 --> 01:31:39.115]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:39.115 --> 01:31:40.415]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:40.415 --> 01:31:43.076]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:43.076 --> 01:31:47.297]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:47.297 --> 01:31:51.938]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:31:51.938 --> 01:31:54.518]  That's endofamerica3.com.

[01:32:02.904 --> 01:32:15.196]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great-tasting, long-term, storable food from eFoods Direct, and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:22.363]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and salmonella?
[01:32:22.563 --> 01:32:26.687]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:32:26.687 --> 01:32:29.030]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:33.855]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.

[01:33:02.253 --> 01:33:05.861]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.861 --> 01:33:09.068]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:40.932 --> 01:33:42.234]  I was tired.
[01:33:42.234 --> 01:33:42.735]  I went down.
[01:33:42.735 --> 01:33:44.337]  We're going to show you video of this tomorrow.
[01:33:44.337 --> 01:33:45.118]  We don't have time today.
[01:33:45.118 --> 01:33:50.886]  I went down to investigate the border and what was happening there with the cartels and things.
[01:33:50.886 --> 01:33:53.970]  I spent a few days with my family with me there at a hotel in South Padre.
[01:33:55.356 --> 01:33:58.959]  And the red tide hit a couple days into it, and they thought, oh, it's no problem.
[01:33:58.959 --> 01:34:00.920]  The hotel told me, don't worry about it.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.162]  But I noticed all the fish dying, and I couldn't breathe.
[01:34:03.162 --> 01:34:05.564]  I didn't know it was a neurotoxin.
[01:34:05.564 --> 01:34:07.585]  And some of my kids got sick.
[01:34:07.585 --> 01:34:09.647]  So on our way back, I'm not feeling too good.
[01:34:09.647 --> 01:34:11.448]  My kids are sick in the back.
[01:34:11.448 --> 01:34:13.210]  I just want to get home.
[01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:15.231]  And 98 miles into the U.S.
[01:34:15.231 --> 01:34:16.752]  I never left the U.S.
[01:34:16.752 --> 01:34:21.176]  I pull up at the same Border Patrol checkpoint I was at three weeks ago.
[01:34:21.176 --> 01:34:23.718]  I wanted to go back down there and cover what was happening at the border.
[01:34:25.183 --> 01:34:31.929]  And I pull up and the guy says, I'm going to direct you over here, I'm going to search your vehicle.
[01:34:31.929 --> 01:34:33.130]  They got drug dogs.
[01:34:33.130 --> 01:34:37.234]  He goes, I'm going to check your immigration status with a drug dog.
[01:34:37.234 --> 01:34:41.398]  And I go over and I say, I know about the Border Patrol dealing drugs.
[01:34:41.398 --> 01:34:44.621]  You can pull it up, just type Border Patrol caught bringing drugs in.
[01:34:44.621 --> 01:34:47.904]  Fashion Furious, Sinaloa Cartel, eight agencies,
[01:34:49.446 --> 01:34:53.990]  involved in Homeland Security in allowing certain cartels to bring drugs in.
[01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:57.313]  They're told, let certain 18-wheelers through.
[01:34:57.313 --> 01:35:03.258]  And I'm not saying the individual who came to the RV was a drug dealer.
[01:35:03.258 --> 01:35:03.959]  No.
[01:35:03.959 --> 01:35:08.202]  I'm saying that this is an agency caught doing it.
[01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.103]  Over and over again.
[01:35:09.103 --> 01:35:14.287]  So they are the ones who should have people searching them.
[01:35:14.287 --> 01:35:15.548]  Not me and my family.
[01:35:16.269 --> 01:35:22.253]  With all their license plate reading cameras that are 200 yards before you get there, they're already running your plates.
[01:35:22.253 --> 01:35:25.795]  You pull in there, and you're guilty, you're bad.
[01:35:25.795 --> 01:35:28.817]  They're the official, they're the authority, like Nazi Germany.
[01:35:28.817 --> 01:35:29.978]  You're gonna be checked.
[01:35:29.978 --> 01:35:31.559]  And I told them, and I meant it.
[01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:36.202]  I'm gonna file suit on the next cop, the next checkpoint, the next garbage.
[01:35:36.202 --> 01:35:40.145]  The next TSA that tries to grab my genitals, I'm suing your butt.
[01:35:40.145 --> 01:35:42.827]  And you may beat the rap, but you're not beating the ride.
[01:35:43.647 --> 01:35:46.929]  It's time to recognize this stuff is going nationwide.
[01:35:46.929 --> 01:35:48.109]  This is a takedown.
[01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:54.612]  They're training you to literally be in a database when you go to a checkpoint they set up.
[01:35:54.612 --> 01:36:02.836]  They set up years ago the plan to have internal checkpoints at state borders, random checkpoints, highway checkpoints, and now they're doing it!
[01:36:02.836 --> 01:36:07.078]  This isn't just 98 miles in, this is in Tennessee!
[01:36:07.078 --> 01:36:08.699]  With the feds out of their jurisdiction.
[01:36:08.699 --> 01:36:10.640]  This is so nightmarish.
[01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:21.308]  Now, this is unedited video, except for the names of my children, and things like that, and video of my children, who were involved, who've been cut out of the video.
[01:36:21.308 --> 01:36:21.888]  But here it is.
[01:36:21.888 --> 01:36:24.850]  Nazi Germany comes to America.
[01:36:24.850 --> 01:36:27.991]  And you're like, but they're just checking you.
[01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:29.912]  Why don't I check them?
[01:36:29.912 --> 01:36:30.912]  I mean, I got an article.
[01:36:30.912 --> 01:36:32.393]  Let's show the other article before we go to this.
[01:36:35.899 --> 01:36:42.642]  Look at that, CNS News, Napolitano DHS authorizing illegal aliens to work in the US.
[01:36:42.642 --> 01:36:44.843]  You can see the clip right there.
[01:36:44.843 --> 01:36:50.425]  It's come out in Associated Press that illegal aliens built the border fence.
[01:36:50.425 --> 01:36:51.346]  Illegal aliens
[01:36:54.068 --> 01:36:57.071]  Are openly allowed to come into the U.S.
[01:36:57.071 --> 01:36:59.974]  And I'm not against, by the way, the folks from Mexico coming in here and wanting a job.
[01:36:59.974 --> 01:37:01.616]  Because the globalists are employing their country.
[01:37:01.616 --> 01:37:04.019]  The point is, they're brought in to drive down wages.
[01:37:04.019 --> 01:37:07.843]  They're brought in by the big corporations to bust the unions and all the systems.
[01:37:07.843 --> 01:37:10.826]  But then the unions are bought off, so they promote open borders.
[01:37:11.707 --> 01:37:20.310]  Instead of folks staying in Mexico and causing an actual downfall of that corrupt system, the globalists use it as a steam valve to then bring down the U.S.
[01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:21.410]  See, it's all divide and conquer.
[01:37:21.410 --> 01:37:24.171]  It's very sophisticated geometry.
[01:37:24.171 --> 01:37:27.152]  That's why the average person who hasn't thought about it does understand it.
[01:37:27.152 --> 01:37:28.873]  But again, I'm digressing.
[01:37:28.873 --> 01:37:34.455]  The point is, illegals, they've frozen all deportations.
[01:37:36.812 --> 01:37:39.934]  of people from Mexico, because it's political.
[01:37:39.934 --> 01:37:44.276]  Everybody else from Honduras, Nicaragua, China, you're gone.
[01:37:44.276 --> 01:37:46.897]  They had camps, by the way, down on the border, filled.
[01:37:46.897 --> 01:37:54.021]  They had 5,000 with Salvadorans, El Salvadorans, just at that particular Bayview Detention Center.
[01:37:54.021 --> 01:37:57.823]  And I did an investigation of that while I was there on the radio that a lot of you watched.
[01:37:57.823 --> 01:38:01.045]  The point is, this is all going on.
[01:38:01.045 --> 01:38:03.246]  And so it's so asinine.
[01:38:03.246 --> 01:38:04.687]  Now watch the video.
[01:38:05.487 --> 01:38:15.473]  This is important, because I know the Supreme Court's rule that 100 miles in, that's about a third of the country, all the way around the nation, you can pull up the maps of this.
[01:38:15.473 --> 01:38:18.455]  In fact, pull up a Constitution Free Zone for folks.
[01:38:18.455 --> 01:38:24.118]  Just type that in and you'll get the official maps.
[01:38:24.118 --> 01:38:27.540]  They are searching people, and I've talked to
[01:38:29.184 --> 01:38:49.160]  A lot of folks here in my office, in fact a couple of the guys that work in the shipping and advertising department, who happen to be Hispanic, and he says when you go through these things, and they do a stereotypical typecasting or whatever, they just wave you through, because they don't want illegals.
[01:38:49.963 --> 01:38:51.064]  They don't want that.
[01:38:51.064 --> 01:38:52.424]  They're there to search vehicles.
[01:38:52.424 --> 01:38:54.385]  They're there to break the will of the American people.
[01:38:54.385 --> 01:38:56.847]  They're there to set the precedent.
[01:38:56.847 --> 01:39:04.331]  100 miles into the country, around a third of our geometric, geographical mass, you were searched.
[01:39:04.331 --> 01:39:06.532]  This is absolute bull.
[01:39:06.532 --> 01:39:12.555]  Now, here's the key to all of this, because I know I'm ranting on and on before I get to the video.
[01:39:12.555 --> 01:39:15.577]  I tell them, I know the Supreme Court's ruled you can do this.
[01:39:15.577 --> 01:39:17.598]  The Supreme Court also ruled black people weren't humans.
[01:39:20.754 --> 01:39:27.017]  So I don't, they rule I can't own private property tomorrow, or I can't own guns, or that I gotta turn my kids over to the state.
[01:39:27.017 --> 01:39:28.778]  I'm not following it.
[01:39:28.778 --> 01:39:31.740]  But they say the Supreme Court's rule we can verify citizenship.
[01:39:31.740 --> 01:39:39.043]  Yeah, they do these internal citizen checkpoints instead of at the border, where they wave everybody through.
[01:39:39.043 --> 01:39:42.345]  And then he says, I say, you're looking for drugs, I'm gonna sue you.
[01:39:42.345 --> 01:39:43.626]  You wanna violate my Fourth Amendment?
[01:39:43.626 --> 01:39:45.907]  He says, no we're not, we're looking for narcotics.
[01:39:47.108 --> 01:39:50.010]  So he plays some little mind game with me.
[01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:53.451]  And they first swaggered over like a gang.
[01:39:53.451 --> 01:39:56.673]  And, you know, again, I have my camera on in my lap.
[01:39:56.673 --> 01:40:00.075]  I wasn't going to hold it up like last time when they said turn your camera off and I didn't.
[01:40:00.075 --> 01:40:01.416]  I said, Richard, you watch.
[01:40:01.416 --> 01:40:02.516]  He's like, this will be a piece of cake.
[01:40:02.516 --> 01:40:03.337]  And I said, no, it won't.
[01:40:04.255 --> 01:40:05.096]  Okay?
[01:40:05.096 --> 01:40:06.418]  They're going to want to pull us over.
[01:40:06.418 --> 01:40:10.483]  Richard went down there with me to help produce the show and drive in the RV.
[01:40:10.483 --> 01:40:14.628]  And I kept the camera in my lap rolling and when I got up and got in his face.
[01:40:14.628 --> 01:40:16.870]  I mean, this is the death of everything.
[01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:19.554]  And folks, a lot of you are saying, hey, we like the Border Patrol.
[01:40:19.554 --> 01:40:20.675]  They're protecting us.
[01:40:20.675 --> 01:40:21.116]  Baloney.
[01:40:23.186 --> 01:40:25.207]  This is nothing to do with our sovereignty.
[01:40:25.207 --> 01:40:27.229]  This is about the Fourth Amendment being killed.
[01:40:53.827 --> 01:40:55.928]  Let's go ahead and go to the report.
[01:40:55.928 --> 01:40:56.629]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:58.310]  We already shot a YouTube video.
[01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:59.431]  This isn't Fast and Furious.
[01:40:59.431 --> 01:41:04.295]  I don't deal in narcotics like the Border Patrol, and Obama, and the ATF, and all you guys.
[01:41:04.295 --> 01:41:05.936]  I just took my family to the beach again.
[01:41:05.936 --> 01:41:08.678]  Okay.
[01:41:08.678 --> 01:41:13.302]  All right, again, we exposed the unconstitutional internal checkpoints here.
[01:41:13.302 --> 01:41:18.906]  And here I was, wanting to go down and check out the border, go down and interview some people.
[01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:22.629]  I shot that from my hotel balcony before the red tide hit.
[01:41:24.358 --> 01:41:25.759]  And made us all basically sick.
[01:41:25.759 --> 01:41:29.021]  The air was just full of that neurotoxin being released by the algae.
[01:41:29.021 --> 01:41:31.162]  It's being fed by all the fertilizer.
[01:41:31.162 --> 01:41:35.224]  Artificial fertilizer pouring out through the rivers into the gulf.
[01:41:35.224 --> 01:41:38.145]  And I pulled up to it and I knew what was coming.
[01:41:38.145 --> 01:41:40.547]  And I decided not to be provocative.
[01:41:40.547 --> 01:41:50.152]  It was just amazing.
[01:41:50.152 --> 01:41:52.333]  Look, we just opened everybody's cars up.
[01:41:53.755 --> 01:41:57.598]  These guys know I already made them a big star earlier.
[01:41:57.598 --> 01:42:00.900]  This is hilarious.
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:07.284]  Again, right here, I'm not filming the drug dog people opening their cars and then going in their cars.
[01:42:07.284 --> 01:42:11.207]  Because I'm, last time I did film that and they said turn your camera off and I refused.
[01:42:11.207 --> 01:42:14.389]  I said I'm just gonna sit here and hold it in my lap just to prove
[01:42:15.697 --> 01:42:19.580]  To Richard, who was thinking, oh no, let's just be nice and see what they do.
[01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:20.701]  It was a test.
[01:42:20.701 --> 01:42:26.586]  I sat there and was talking with the camera in my lap aimed at Richard, down where they couldn't see it.
[01:42:26.586 --> 01:42:31.070]  And I was watching them search the people's cars.
[01:42:31.070 --> 01:42:33.512]  I was watching them pull them over and put the dog in their car.
[01:42:51.403 --> 01:42:55.404]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:42:55.404 --> 01:42:58.665]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:42:58.665 --> 01:43:03.466]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:43:03.466 --> 01:43:09.847]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:09.847 --> 01:43:12.088]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:43:12.628 --> 01:43:12.928]  Tim Geithner?
[01:43:12.928 --> 01:43:13.448]  Bernanke?
[01:43:13.448 --> 01:43:14.109]  They're arsonists!
[01:43:14.109 --> 01:43:15.209]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:43:15.209 --> 01:43:17.630]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:31.536 --> 01:43:35.901]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:43:35.901 --> 01:43:38.804]  we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:43:38.804 --> 01:43:47.934]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:43:51.089 --> 01:43:52.811]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:43:52.811 --> 01:43:58.116]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:43:58.116 --> 01:43:59.658]  Saving means to make money.
[01:43:59.658 --> 01:44:08.427]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:44:09.168 --> 01:44:16.714]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:44:16.714 --> 01:44:24.720]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:44:24.720 --> 01:44:29.943]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:44:29.943 --> 01:44:32.105]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:44:40.417 --> 01:44:42.581]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[01:44:49.619 --> 01:44:54.162]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:54.162 --> 01:44:55.082]  Number one.
[01:44:55.082 --> 01:44:58.505]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:58.505 --> 01:44:59.365]  Number two.
[01:44:59.365 --> 01:45:04.268]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:45:04.268 --> 01:45:05.009]  It's true.
[01:45:05.009 --> 01:45:09.872]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:45:09.872 --> 01:45:10.712]  Number three.
[01:45:10.712 --> 01:45:14.295]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:45:14.295 --> 01:45:17.977]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:45:18.197 --> 01:45:18.978]  Number 4.
[01:45:18.978 --> 01:45:21.741]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:45:21.741 --> 01:45:25.425]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:45:25.425 --> 01:45:26.226]  Number 5.
[01:45:26.226 --> 01:45:30.371]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:45:30.371 --> 01:45:35.136]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:45:35.416 --> 01:45:39.579]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:45:39.579 --> 01:45:41.380]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:45:46.244 --> 01:45:56.631]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:45:56.631 --> 01:46:01.775]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:46:01.775 --> 01:46:03.656]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:46:05.836 --> 01:46:10.498]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:46:10.498 --> 01:46:14.561]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:46:14.561 --> 01:46:16.742]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:46:16.742 --> 01:46:23.585]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:46:23.585 --> 01:46:26.647]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[01:46:28.645 --> 01:46:30.787]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:46:30.787 --> 01:46:32.569]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:46:32.569 --> 01:46:35.472]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:46:35.472 --> 01:46:42.078]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:46:44.801 --> 01:46:47.163]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[01:46:47.163 --> 01:46:48.044]  Others don't.
[01:46:51.041 --> 01:46:54.624]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:46:54.624 --> 01:46:58.547]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:46:58.547 --> 01:47:03.712]  Okay, we're back.
[01:47:03.712 --> 01:47:05.613]  It's InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:47:05.613 --> 01:47:08.936]  We're about to talk to our next guest on the economy.
[01:47:08.936 --> 01:47:14.981]  And we've got another guest on who's kind of an apologist for the congenital liars of the establishment.
[01:47:17.102 --> 01:47:21.344]  I wanted to just talk about the report we covered last night.
[01:47:21.344 --> 01:47:31.509]  $79 trillion of Bank of America derivatives that they're about to have American taxpayers try to pay for and then lecturers all day about our debts.
[01:47:31.509 --> 01:47:32.330]  It's just incredible.
[01:47:33.638 --> 01:47:42.086]  So it's very important to realize that it's the ultra-rich waging war against the middle class, trying to con basically people that aren't aware of it.
[01:47:42.086 --> 01:47:47.952]  So we're going to be talking about Herman Cain's 9-9-9-9 plan.
[01:47:47.952 --> 01:47:51.115]  Where does that extra nine come in?
[01:47:51.115 --> 01:47:54.478]  And with more on the economy and this vital election,
[01:47:55.259 --> 01:47:59.703]  We're joined by the CEO of Euro-Pacific Capital, Peter Schiff.
[01:47:59.703 --> 01:48:06.929]  He's written an excellent article today that Infowars.com picked up, Business Insider, and many other sites.
[01:48:06.929 --> 01:48:11.794]  There's a hidden nine in Herman Cain's 999 plan.
[01:48:11.794 --> 01:48:17.038]  Now obviously my criticism is, we were always told by the fair taxers they would get rid of the income tax.
[01:48:17.679 --> 01:48:19.779]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:48:44.265 --> 01:48:47.548]  So, you've written this article, but break it down.
[01:48:47.548 --> 01:48:51.270]  Where is the hidden nine in Herman Cain's plan?
[01:48:51.270 --> 01:49:01.717]  Well, the fourth nine is the 9% payroll tax that is imposed through what is purported to be a 9% corporate income tax.
[01:49:01.717 --> 01:49:04.119]  It isn't a 9% corporate income tax.
[01:49:04.119 --> 01:49:06.781]  It actually is a gross receipts tax.
[01:49:06.781 --> 01:49:10.624]  And embedded in that gross receipts tax is a 9% tax on payrolls.
[01:49:12.745 --> 01:49:19.672]  And the only way for businesses to recoup that payroll tax is through their workforce.
[01:49:19.672 --> 01:49:33.304]  Now, granted, that represents a reduction of the 15.3% payroll tax that is already in place, where half of it is paid directly by the worker, and the other half is paid indirectly by the worker through reduced wages.
[01:49:33.945 --> 01:49:39.107]  But the problem is Herman Cain is claiming that he completely gets rid of the payroll tax.
[01:49:39.107 --> 01:49:41.007]  That it no longer exists.
[01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:41.768]  That's not true.
[01:49:41.768 --> 01:49:42.788]  It's still there.
[01:49:42.788 --> 01:49:44.268]  It's just not as high.
[01:49:44.268 --> 01:49:58.913]  But the problem is the way Herman is selling his plan to the average worker is that he's going to get a reduction in taxes because he's going to have no payroll taxes and he's going to pay just a 9% income tax and a 9% sales tax.
[01:49:58.913 --> 01:50:00.214]  If that were really the case,
[01:50:00.854 --> 01:50:05.941]  Then pretty much all working Americans would get a tax cut under the Herman Cain plan.
[01:50:05.941 --> 01:50:10.206]  Of course, if you retired, they were going to get a tax hike, but...
[01:50:11.834 --> 01:50:14.815]  If you account for the fourth nine, that's not the case.
[01:50:14.815 --> 01:50:16.115]  That's a game changer.
[01:50:16.115 --> 01:50:29.538]  What the fourth nine means is that the majority of Americans under the 9-9-9-9 plan are going to be paying 27% of their income in taxes, which is much higher than a lot of those people pay now.
[01:50:29.538 --> 01:50:39.020]  So the only way the plan works, the only way it's revenue neutral, is because you have big tax increases on the middle class and lower class to pay for tax cuts
[01:50:39.660 --> 01:50:41.581]  For higher income workers.
[01:50:41.581 --> 01:50:43.422]  Now, it is a pro-growth plan.
[01:50:43.422 --> 01:50:45.563]  We are going to get more economic growth out of this plan.
[01:50:45.563 --> 01:50:47.505]  We're going to get more jobs out of this plan.
[01:50:47.505 --> 01:50:49.165]  Because we're freeing up capital.
[01:50:49.165 --> 01:50:50.506]  We're treating capital a lot better.
[01:50:50.506 --> 01:50:51.927]  We're going to have more investments.
[01:50:51.927 --> 01:50:53.268]  We're going to have more savings.
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:55.069]  We're going to have more job creation.
[01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:59.011]  But we're going to have to pay for that by putting a bill on the middle class.
[01:50:59.011 --> 01:51:04.114]  Now, if we don't want to stick the middle class with a bill, then we need to cut government spending dramatically.
[01:51:04.494 --> 01:51:13.001]  You know, but the government wants to pretend that we can have a growing economy, all this government spending, and stick the bill on the rich.
[01:51:13.001 --> 01:51:13.961]  It ain't gonna work.
[01:51:13.961 --> 01:51:19.746]  Because if we try to put the bill on the high-income earners, then we're not gonna get the economic growth, then we're not gonna get the jobs.
[01:51:19.966 --> 01:51:22.209]  We're just going to have a lot of government and a lot of unemployment.
[01:51:22.209 --> 01:51:25.274]  Sure, Peter, let me interject here because this is important.
[01:51:25.274 --> 01:51:34.347]  I saw the Economic Policy Journal criticize you, why Peter Schiff and Arthur Laffer are wrong about Herman Cain 999 and it's got classic...
[01:51:35.268 --> 01:51:48.675]  Class warfare garbage about, you just don't want rich people taxed, but sales taxes, VAT taxes, from what I've researched, just basic economics, that always hits the poorest people.
[01:51:48.675 --> 01:51:49.676]  So this makes no sense.
[01:51:50.683 --> 01:51:56.904]  And of course, the people that are hurt the most by taxes that discourage job creation are the people who are looking for jobs.
[01:51:56.904 --> 01:52:02.005]  So, by keeping taxes high on the job creators, we're keeping a lot of people unemployed.
[01:52:02.005 --> 01:52:06.986]  They would be better to get a job and then pay some taxes than to be unemployed and pay no taxes.
[01:52:06.986 --> 01:52:13.408]  But, you know, Art Laffer is applauding the 999 plan because he doesn't know about the hidden nine.
[01:52:13.408 --> 01:52:15.148]  See, I have a difference of opinion.
[01:52:15.148 --> 01:52:17.309]  I figured out that there's a fourth nine.
[01:52:17.309 --> 01:52:19.009]  Art Laffer doesn't even know that yet.
[01:52:19.649 --> 01:52:29.377]  But the thing is, I'm in favor of moving towards a tax structure where people are taxed based on what they spend, not based on what they earn.
[01:52:29.377 --> 01:52:37.743]  Now the standard liberal argument is, well that's not fair, because the rich people don't spend everything like the poor people, they save some of their money.
[01:52:37.743 --> 01:52:38.944]  Well precisely!
[01:52:38.944 --> 01:52:43.107]  We want them to save their money, because when they save their money, they're delaying
[01:52:43.507 --> 01:52:45.108]  Gratification for themselves.
[01:52:45.108 --> 01:52:48.190]  They're postponing their consumption into the future.
[01:52:48.190 --> 01:52:50.772]  When they eventually spend, they'll pay the taxes.
[01:52:50.772 --> 01:52:54.314]  But in the meantime, the money is used to grow the economy.
[01:52:54.314 --> 01:52:56.595]  It provides capital for businesses.
[01:52:56.595 --> 01:53:05.261]  Either the individual who's earning the money uses it to grow his own business, or he loans it out either through the banking system or directly to some other entrepreneur.
[01:53:06.081 --> 01:53:14.184]  Why would we want to take money that was going to be used to grow the economy and send it to Washington, where it's going to use it to undermine the economy?
[01:53:14.184 --> 01:53:21.948]  Peter, let me expand on that because, you know, I had read your excellent, there's a hidden nine in Herman Cain's plan today.
[01:53:21.948 --> 01:53:23.708]  I hadn't read this full article.
[01:53:23.708 --> 01:53:29.551]  Now I've actually had a chance, we were talking to scan over it a bit, and they're actually criticizing you in this.
[01:53:31.673 --> 01:53:39.035]  But they're saying you're endorsing his 9-9-9-9 plan, but I follow you closely.
[01:53:39.035 --> 01:53:42.936]  I haven't seen you endorse Kaine's 9-9-9 plan.
[01:53:42.936 --> 01:53:48.478]  No, I haven't endorsed it, and I think it's a loser in the general election.
[01:53:48.478 --> 01:53:53.799]  If Kaine gets the nomination with his 9-9-9 plan, it's going to come out that there's a fourth 9 in there.
[01:53:54.339 --> 01:53:59.306]  And, you know, the public is going to reject it because they're not going to vote for higher taxes on themselves.
[01:53:59.306 --> 01:54:04.894]  But my whole point is, it shows just how much of the tax burden the rich currently bear.
[01:54:04.894 --> 01:54:11.302]  I mean, if you're going to reduce the taxes on the upper income people so that it's the same as people that earn less money...
[01:54:12.083 --> 01:54:13.123]  You can't do that.
[01:54:13.123 --> 01:54:21.385]  So, either you've got to massively cut government spending, or you've got to raise taxes on the middle class in order to cut taxes on Huffington.
[01:54:21.385 --> 01:54:23.005]  Hold on, let me quantify this.
[01:54:23.005 --> 01:54:24.606]  We're not going to get growth.
[01:54:24.606 --> 01:54:30.587]  Let me quantify this, because I had a college student call me today and he said, you don't want to redistribute the wealth, the 1%.
[01:54:30.587 --> 01:54:33.548]  You know, you're basically anti-American.
[01:54:33.548 --> 01:54:35.188]  But it wasn't reality based.
[01:54:36.328 --> 01:54:37.569]  And so quantify that.
[01:54:37.569 --> 01:54:50.075]  You're explaining to people, if you cut the taxes on the rich, yeah, that would speed the economy up, but this plan actually increases it overall on the poor, who aren't paying a lot of taxes right now, and that'll cause issues as well.
[01:54:50.075 --> 01:54:51.056]  That's what you're getting at, right?
[01:54:51.736 --> 01:54:54.837]  But it's also increasing taxes on the middle class.
[01:54:54.837 --> 01:54:58.018]  Most people are going to get a tax hike under this plan.
[01:54:58.018 --> 01:55:00.599]  See, the real problem is government is too big.
[01:55:00.599 --> 01:55:01.980]  Government is too expensive.
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:06.001]  We have to cut government so that we don't have to raise taxes on anybody.
[01:55:06.001 --> 01:55:09.703]  In fact, if we cut enough government, we can lower taxes on everybody.
[01:55:09.703 --> 01:55:13.604]  But if we want all this government that we have now, it is very expensive.
[01:55:13.604 --> 01:55:16.085]  And we can't put the bill just on the rich.
[01:55:16.405 --> 01:55:17.967]  Because then the economy collapses.
[01:55:17.967 --> 01:55:22.893]  So if we want all this government, the truth is the middle class has got to pay for it.
[01:55:22.893 --> 01:55:25.395]  And people think that the rich are getting away with murder.
[01:55:25.395 --> 01:55:28.659]  Look, I'm paying about half my income in taxes right now.
[01:55:28.659 --> 01:55:31.422]  I don't know how much more I can take.
[01:55:31.422 --> 01:55:35.387]  They're trying to pretend that the rich are paying less in taxes than their secretaries.
[01:55:35.387 --> 01:55:36.208]  That's nonsense.
[01:55:36.528 --> 01:55:41.453]  And not only are the rich paying higher rates than their secretaries, but in absolute numbers?
[01:55:41.453 --> 01:55:42.915]  I mean, think about Warren Buffett.
[01:55:42.915 --> 01:55:46.018]  They're saying he's paying less rate than his secretary.
[01:55:46.018 --> 01:55:47.679]  They're saying Warren Buffett is paying 17%.
[01:55:47.679 --> 01:55:50.482]  Yeah, but he's paying like 10 million a year.
[01:55:50.482 --> 01:55:54.486]  I mean, his secretary might be paying a higher rate, but maybe she's only paying 10,000.
[01:55:55.427 --> 01:56:02.209]  Versus his 10 million, but it's also a lie because Warren Buffett is the biggest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:56:02.209 --> 01:56:03.569]  He doesn't even take a salary.
[01:56:03.569 --> 01:56:05.010]  He works for free.
[01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:10.151]  So his income is Berkshire's income and Berkshire Hathaway is paying 35% income tax.
[01:56:10.151 --> 01:56:11.432]  That's Warren's money.
[01:56:11.432 --> 01:56:12.632]  He's paying his taxes.
[01:56:13.012 --> 01:56:14.673]  Through Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:56:14.673 --> 01:56:14.953]  Sure.
[01:56:14.953 --> 01:56:19.656]  So, not only is he paying a lot more in taxes than his secretary, but he's paying a higher rate.
[01:56:19.656 --> 01:56:23.559]  And anybody who says otherwise, including Warren Buffett, is lying.
[01:56:23.559 --> 01:56:24.499]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:56:24.499 --> 01:56:27.401]  Here in Texas, we have a stealth income tax.
[01:56:27.401 --> 01:56:28.662]  That's the franchise tax.
[01:56:28.662 --> 01:56:34.786]  I pay taxes on all the equipment, everything, and a percentage on my profits.
[01:56:34.786 --> 01:56:37.488]  And, I mean, it's taxes on top of taxes.
[01:56:37.488 --> 01:56:39.009]  So let me ask you this question.
[01:56:39.009 --> 01:56:42.051]  Why, then, do we see the ultra-rich, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett,
[01:56:42.691 --> 01:56:43.153]  And others.
[01:56:43.153 --> 01:56:44.938]  I mean, I have my answer for it.
[01:56:44.938 --> 01:56:48.811]  Why do we see them promoting higher taxes?
[01:56:50.489 --> 01:56:59.933]  Well, you know, Warren Buffett, you know, he actually benefits from the estate tax because a lot of businesses have to be sold because they can't survive the estate tax.
[01:56:59.933 --> 01:57:03.574]  And then Warren gets to buy them up on the cheap through Berkshire Hathaway.
[01:57:03.574 --> 01:57:08.916]  So he has an interest in breaking up a lot of these businesses, even though it's a destructive tax.
[01:57:08.916 --> 01:57:12.337]  On the income tax, I don't know, maybe he just wants to be liked.
[01:57:12.337 --> 01:57:14.038]  You know, it's a lot easier to be liked
[01:57:14.438 --> 01:57:22.862]  If you adopt these liberal agenda, it's more difficult to have to explain to people why just taxing the rich is a bad deal.
