[00:00:04.878 --> 00:00:09.701]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:11.282]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:12.843]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.843 --> 00:00:17.046]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:21.109]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:40.966]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition of the Worldwide Transmission.
[00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:54.916]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours and I am surveying western areas of the United States to see for myself how much globalism and the tattletale control-free society has expanded.
[00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:57.538]  I will have reports for you later in the hour.
[00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:01.579]  On basically what I have witnessed while we have been out here.
[00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:11.362]  I am now in southern Utah crossing over from the Grand Canyon in Arizona yesterday and I've already filed some of those video reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:16.444]  I'm going to be filing more as soon as I can get to a spot that has good internet.
[00:01:16.444 --> 00:01:23.366]  I am literally a hundred miles from nowhere as the Dwight Yoakum song says.
[00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.326]  In fact, I'm
[00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:28.634]  I'm probably 500 miles from nowhere, and so all we've got is a landline.
[00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:36.909]  That's another reason I'm engaging in this trip, is I plan to travel around the country a lot next year, giving speeches and visiting our AM and FM affiliates.
[00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:44.896]  And just unfortunately we would try to go up on a mountain top of the RV and it just would not connect so we're here via landline.
[00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:57.828]  We have quite a broadcast lined up for you today to say the very least and we're going to be breaking all that down here in just a moment and just the unbelievable quickening of what's happening.
[00:01:57.828 --> 00:02:02.152]  We have Gerald Salente joining us with an update on what's happening.
[00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:05.464]  We're good to go.
[00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:24.490]  Now saying they don't know where it is, and I guess the federal government, because most of the regulators, including the head of the CFTC, were invested with Mr. Corzine.
[00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.872]  Of course, they all got the warning to get out early, like the Koch brothers.
[00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:34.434]  So this is a new level of where they just take the money out of your segregated personal account.
[00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:35.274]  I've done some research.
[00:02:35.274 --> 00:02:38.115]  Those are supposedly guaranteed as well through another system.
[00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:39.916]  But now they're saying, no, this is a new way to
[00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:44.658]  We're taking your money, so Gerald Cilente is going to be joining us.
[00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:49.880]  Jesse Ventura, you've got to get him while he's hot, because he's about to go back to Mexico, at least for a few months.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.081]  He's going to be joining us.
[00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:54.022]  We'll talk more about will he run for president.
[00:02:54.022 --> 00:02:55.843]  I've now talked to Libertarian Party people.
[00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:58.404]  They certainly would like to entertain that.
[00:02:58.404 --> 00:03:04.806]  We also have Max Keiser joining us about the importance of the MF Global fiasco.
[00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:08.588]  And InfoWars Nightly co-host, Nightly News co-host Aaron Dykes.
[00:03:09.748 --> 00:03:17.850]  We'll also be in Austin, Texas riding shotgun with us as backup in case I have any technical difficulties.
[00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.391]  I'll also be adding quite a bit of his expert analysis and historical commentary to backstop what we're covering here.
[00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:32.292]  We're going to go to break in a moment and I'll come back and run through the unbelievable developments, but here's just some of them.
[00:03:32.292 --> 00:03:37.073]  New York Times tries to blame political film for White House shooting.
[00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:38.233]  Guess what political film?
[00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:42.489]  That's right, the Obama deception.
[00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.190]  Continuing, Egypt's brutal military junta is supported by Obama administration.
[00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.550]  Remember CIA, Anderson Cooper?
[00:03:50.550 --> 00:04:01.972]  Oh, it's so gracious, the democracy in Egypt, as they kicked out the old dictator who wasn't brutal enough, and now just machine gun people en masse and beat their heads in.
[00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:06.733]  And the Egyptian military is saying, look at the police in America, they shoot and kill people.
[00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.353]  So now America is an example of
[00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:08.753]  We're good.
[00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:31.578]  I discovered Forbes did a big article on us a few days ago with the headline, talk show host and guest, talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for run on banks.
[00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:38.363]  What we said is the globalists are going to pick people off one by one and steal your bank accounts outright.
[00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:41.105]  Also put all these crazy fines and fees on it.
[00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:44.727]  And so what MF Global and others are doing is going to destroy confidence.
[00:04:44.727 --> 00:04:47.529]  That's already happening with people getting their money out of the big mega banks.
[00:04:48.496 --> 00:04:49.800]  We'll be right back after the break.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.167]  It is an incredibly jam-packed transmission.
[00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.551]  I'm Alex Jones for Suplanet.TV.
[00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:04.742]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.742 --> 00:05:05.643]  Number one.
[00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:09.066]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:09.926]  Number two.
[00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:14.830]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.570]  It's true.
[00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.454]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:21.275]  Number three.
[00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:24.857]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.540]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.541]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:32.303]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.303 --> 00:05:35.987]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.987 --> 00:05:36.788]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:40.931]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.931 --> 00:05:45.696]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.976 --> 00:05:50.137]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:51.938]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.938 --> 00:05:54.178]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.178 --> 00:05:56.799]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:05:56.799 --> 00:06:01.220]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:08.142]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.142 --> 00:06:10.423]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:16.066]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:19.108]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.430]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.694]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:31.076]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:36.839]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.500]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.621]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:42.442]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.442 --> 00:06:46.663]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:46.663 --> 00:06:51.284]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:53.885]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:57.746]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:05.525]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:14.388]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.388 --> 00:07:19.009]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:29.833]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:39.975]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:39.975 --> 00:07:45.397]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:52.898]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:52.898 --> 00:07:55.639]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:09.958]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:09.958 --> 00:08:11.539]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:12.880]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.283]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.283 --> 00:08:22.126]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:28.311]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:32.154]  Welcome, folks listening all across the world on XM Satellite Global Shortwave W.
[00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.617]  Okay, we have some kind of technical issue.
[00:08:38.617 --> 00:08:54.847]  Alex is going to be back in just a moment, but of course the news is loaded and chief among them is this so-called assassination plot where the accused assassin has been linked to none other than Alex Jones's Obama deception.
[00:08:54.847 --> 00:08:59.610]  They've got the guy who allegedly sold him the gun, quoting that he knows he
[00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.672]  Watched The Obama Deception, produced and written by Alex Jones.
[00:09:03.672 --> 00:09:13.238]  He doesn't recall, however, if Mr. Ortega ever talked of taking violent action, but he does recall the political film he watched online.
[00:09:13.238 --> 00:09:19.162]  So that's a very interesting tie-in, as they've repeatedly tried to demonize this broadcast and other alternative news.
[00:09:19.722 --> 00:09:25.603]  And furthermore, you see a resurgence of this talking point where now you're supposed to watch what you say.
[00:09:25.603 --> 00:09:28.324]  You have to be careful who and how you criticize.
[00:09:28.324 --> 00:09:44.548]  You've got the Christian Post reporting, quoted here in Kurt Nemo's article, that conservatives and faith leaders warn Christians to be more careful of how they criticize political opponents after court documents revealed that the suspect in the White House shooting Oscar Romero Ortega Hernandez
[00:09:45.208 --> 00:09:47.831]  Believe President Obama to be the Antichrist.
[00:09:47.831 --> 00:09:59.766]  So just like in the Tucson shooting and other incidents, you see an attempt to blame the rhetoric in media for actual attempted violent action or in the case of Tucson, actual violent action.
[00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:00.928]  We have Alex back on the line.
[00:10:05.015 --> 00:10:05.656]  We're good.
[00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:25.309]  The searchers in a yellow ribbon.
[00:10:25.309 --> 00:10:28.570]  But we are here basically tracking globalist activities.
[00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.891]  I left the Grand Canyon yesterday.
[00:10:31.891 --> 00:10:36.313]  I'll have reports on that for people coming up in the third hour today.
[00:10:36.313 --> 00:10:39.054]  Again, I join you by phone, not by our crystal clear...
[00:10:40.346 --> 00:10:41.027]  We're good to go.
[00:10:54.999 --> 00:10:56.841]  I think we're good.
[00:11:22.142 --> 00:11:26.406]  The New York Times tries to blame political film for White House shooting.
[00:11:26.406 --> 00:11:28.988]  The political film is the Obama deception.
[00:11:28.988 --> 00:11:34.173]  And we've got all these, quote, conservative Christian leaders coming out and saying, don't criticize the government.
[00:11:34.173 --> 00:11:35.254]  It's not of the Lord.
[00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:38.737]  That's all part of the FEMA clergy response team situation.
[00:11:38.737 --> 00:11:45.523]  Very frightening that they continue to have so-called friends of all these different shooters come out and blame our films.
[00:11:45.523 --> 00:11:48.866]  When my film, The Obama Deception, says Obama is a puppet,
[00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:50.847]  Not even a bad person.
[00:11:50.847 --> 00:11:53.030]  He's a teleprompter reading a minion.
[00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.371]  A nobody.
[00:11:54.371 --> 00:12:00.357]  And then it's the mega banks, the council on foreign relations, the private federal reserve.
[00:12:00.357 --> 00:12:04.100]  We never call for offensive violence.
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.764]  And I don't believe for a minute his so-called friend that's quoted in the
[00:12:09.225 --> 00:12:27.286]  New York Times, just like with Poplowski, the guy that shot three cops, and within two hours, the Southern Poverty Law Center connected writer, who later had to retract, five of her publications had to retract, had said that he shot the cops because of me, when they actually released
[00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:43.672]  His full searching record, and what he was visiting, it was hundreds of sites, including Fox News, CNN, and it turned out Richard Poplosky hated Alex Jones, hated Infowars.com, and posted on all the big white supremacist sites, posted on our site attacking us.
[00:12:44.232 --> 00:12:49.134]  And the system knew it and didn't care within two hours.
[00:12:49.134 --> 00:12:51.235]  The cops weren't even cold yet.
[00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:54.856]  They blamed us when he was drunk with pit bulls.
[00:12:54.856 --> 00:12:59.078]  His mother, he was a mama's boy, he got thrown out of the Marine Corps.
[00:12:59.078 --> 00:13:01.899]  She said, you're not going to have a second dog.
[00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:04.760]  They're crapping all over the floor, excuse my French.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:05.780]  And he threw a fit.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.581]  She said, I'm calling the police to throw you out.
[00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:08.862]  You know, 4 a.m.
[00:13:08.862 --> 00:13:14.286]  in the morning, they showed up and he shot him with his semi-auto AK-47.
[00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:16.067]  Okay, so that's what happened there.
[00:13:16.067 --> 00:13:21.711]  And within two hours of him being in handcuffs, they came out on the news and said he did it for Alex Jones.
[00:13:21.711 --> 00:13:25.274]  They went into his computer and said, look, this guy's attacking Alex Jones.
[00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:27.135]  We'll blame him.
[00:13:27.135 --> 00:13:28.737]  Same thing with Tucson.
[00:13:28.737 --> 00:13:30.238]  I got blamed for it.
[00:13:30.238 --> 00:13:31.919]  Turned out the guy was attacking me.
[00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:33.320]  He was a big liberal.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.483]  And then fried his brain on a bunch of drugs and was connected to psychiatrists, as usual.
[00:13:38.164 --> 00:13:38.885]  We're good to go.
[00:13:55.905 --> 00:14:01.927]  It might not even be a bad person individually, but will still be politically destroyed and blamed for the entire agenda.
[00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:13.130]  This is very, very, very, very dangerous and that's why you have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, the FBI visited us three days before the Obama deception was released.
[00:14:13.959 --> 00:14:24.767]  They delivered a gag order to us, would not say why they were there, but kept asking about the Obama deception in the days after they would call up and ask my employees questions about it.
[00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.309]  And then, of course, I had a gag order.
[00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:32.413]  All I could say is the FBI came here, and then, of course, it later came out in the news that they had indeed been to our office.
[00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.195]  Folks thought that was some stunt.
[00:14:34.195 --> 00:14:37.697]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're on almost 100 AM and FM affiliates.
[00:14:37.697 --> 00:14:39.439]  We're on XM, Global Shortwave.
[00:14:39.439 --> 00:14:41.080]  We have 3 million listeners a day.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.622]  We don't need to pull stunts, okay?
[00:14:43.942 --> 00:15:02.989]  We have the New York Times and all these other giant publications attacking us all over the place right now, trying to set us up for violence so that when they SWAT team us or kill us or do whatever they're going to do to me, that they can basically rationalize the whole thing.
[00:15:02.989 --> 00:15:04.570]  They're trying to paint us as violent.
[00:15:05.874 --> 00:15:08.496]  So they can't have the pretext to come after us.
[00:15:08.496 --> 00:15:11.418]  They've got the internet kill switch bill they're pushing.
[00:15:11.418 --> 00:15:14.221]  They've got all this other legislation coming out.
[00:15:14.221 --> 00:15:17.844]  They've got this legislation where under copyright there's no due process.
[00:15:17.844 --> 00:15:19.525]  They can shut down any website.
[00:15:19.525 --> 00:15:20.606]  It's on.
[00:15:20.606 --> 00:15:23.368]  Why is Infowars.com being attacked?
[00:15:23.368 --> 00:15:25.550]  Why is the Obama deception being attacked?
[00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:27.571]  Why is Alex Jones being attacked?
[00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:29.733]  Because we hit the bullseye.
[00:15:29.733 --> 00:15:30.994]  We're over the target.
[00:15:31.254 --> 00:15:34.816]  We're going head-on into this black hole of the New World Order.
[00:15:34.816 --> 00:15:36.196]  We're going in, through, and beyond.
[00:15:36.196 --> 00:15:38.358]  And nothing is going to stop us at the end of the day.
[00:15:38.358 --> 00:15:40.178]  It doesn't matter what happens to Alex Jones.
[00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:41.599]  It doesn't matter what happens to Infowars.com.
[00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:42.980]  That's the reason we're so attacked
[00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:01.909]  We're good to go.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.761]  Uh, chaff.
[00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:33.646]  Here comes the exploding shells putting all the metal into the air to fly through your engines and blow you out.
[00:16:33.646 --> 00:16:38.490]  We are under globalist attack big time because we are actually having a giant effect.
[00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.751]  We had Forbes Magazine.
[00:16:40.894 --> 00:16:47.282]  Just two days ago, come out and say, talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for run on banks.
[00:16:47.282 --> 00:16:54.510]  What we said is it's going to cause a run on banks as these global mega banks and brokerage firms start stealing people's sequestered accounts.
[00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.132]  But that's how they're trying to spin it.
[00:16:56.132 --> 00:16:57.814]  New York Times, Forbes.
[00:16:57.814 --> 00:16:59.215]  Just the attacks continue.
[00:16:59.215 --> 00:16:59.856]  MSNBC.
[00:17:01.142 --> 00:17:06.964]  Uh, Nightline just pounding and attacking savagely because they don't know how to deal with us.
[00:17:06.964 --> 00:17:11.245]  They'd love to kill me in a New York minute, but they know it'll turn us into a martyr.
[00:17:11.245 --> 00:17:12.646]  They know that I've studied history.
[00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:15.226]  They know that I'm committed and don't care, and they understand that.
[00:17:15.226 --> 00:17:18.688]  They don't know how to deal with it, so they're trying to assassinate our character.
[00:17:18.688 --> 00:17:20.568]  So I hope you all realize what we're facing here.
[00:17:20.568 --> 00:17:22.269]  I want to give you some of the news and throw it to Aaron.
[00:17:22.269 --> 00:17:26.130]  New York Times tries to blame political film for a White House shooting.
[00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.611]  Egypt's brutal military junta is supported by Obama administration.
[00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:30.632]  I don't know.
[00:17:49.221 --> 00:17:54.148]  Curling up in a ball to avoid police violence may be considered active resistance.
[00:17:54.148 --> 00:18:02.038]  There's videos coming out of people curled up in balls being billy clubbed and rubber bulleted and pepper sprayed and the police are saying this is the new freedom.
[00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:04.121]  You are resisting us when you curl up in a ball.
[00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:04.581]  I think so.
[00:18:26.203 --> 00:18:26.383]  I think.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:19:01.621]  We are going to go to break and something I want to get into later is that angle that Egyptian military justifies murder of protesters by pointing to American cops and they routinely use the way they handle civilians to justify things that happen overseas often by
[00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:31.254]  Military and other units trained in America, but more on this alleged attempted assassination attempt when Obama wasn't even in the country is the fact that he's been politically desperate for a long time now and the Democratic establishment is scrambling to either justify a resurgence of Obama's political popularity through some kind of pretext or false flag attack or to rebrand another Democrat, Hillary, one possible name floated.
[00:19:31.974 --> 00:19:41.023]  Weekly, weekly, constantly report on how he has politically dropped so bad in the polls that they are desperate to figure out what to do.
[00:19:41.023 --> 00:19:42.365]  So we'll see which way that goes.
[00:19:42.365 --> 00:19:47.550]  We'll be back, as Alex said, with Gerald Cilente, Jesse Ventura, and more.
[00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:48.771]  Max Keiser coming up.
[00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:50.312]  InfoWars.com.
[00:19:50.312 --> 00:19:50.933]  Stay tuned.
[00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:52.555]  Tonight, the InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:07.545]  Burglars love easy targets, like a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:20:07.545 --> 00:20:09.847]  Don't let your home be the next target.
[00:20:09.847 --> 00:20:13.749]  Make it look like someone is home watching television with Fake TV.
[00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:20.873]  Fake TV is a small electronic device that makes the same light as a real television, so from outside it looks like someone is home watching TV.
[00:20:20.873 --> 00:20:25.295]  Fake TV plugs in just like a lamp on a timer, but is far more convincing to burglars.
[00:20:25.295 --> 00:20:31.999]  Fake TV deters burglars, costs far less than an alarm, comes with AC adapter, and is highly recommended by numerous police departments.
[00:20:32.299 --> 00:20:34.059]  Use it anytime you're away from home.
[00:20:34.059 --> 00:20:39.640]  To order your fake TV for only $34.95, go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:46.382]  Each additional fake TV is only $29.95, so get one for you and give one or more for Christmas.
[00:20:46.382 --> 00:20:49.862]  Now through Christmas, get free standard shipping on any quantity fake TV purchase.
[00:20:49.862 --> 00:20:55.443]  Call 877-5-F-A-K-E-TV or go to faketv.com.
[00:20:55.443 --> 00:20:58.124]  Faketv.com, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:07.644]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.
[00:21:07.644 --> 00:21:16.169]  Microplant powder can help unclog arteries and soften heart valves while removing heavy metals, virus, fungus, bacteria, and parasites.
[00:21:16.169 --> 00:21:19.872]  Plus it cleans and purifies the blood, lungs, stomach, and colon.
[00:21:19.872 --> 00:21:23.154]  Keep your body clean with Microplant Powder.
[00:21:23.154 --> 00:21:26.376]  Visit us at HempUSA.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[00:21:29.875 --> 00:21:31.136]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.136 --> 00:21:35.699]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.699 --> 00:21:41.503]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.503 --> 00:21:45.145]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.145 --> 00:21:47.827]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.827 --> 00:21:52.890]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:53.131]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.131 --> 00:21:54.532]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.935 --> 00:22:01.355]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:12.019]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:22:12.019 --> 00:22:16.120]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.223]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:22:19.223 --> 00:22:30.513]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:22:30.513 --> 00:22:33.676]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:22:33.976 --> 00:22:40.160]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:50.025]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:22:50.025 --> 00:22:51.526]  The war is here.
[00:22:51.526 --> 00:22:53.427]  It's an info war.
[00:22:53.427 --> 00:22:56.189]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:23:00.725 --> 00:23:04.106]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[00:23:04.106 --> 00:23:12.289]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:17.611]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[00:23:17.611 --> 00:23:20.593]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[00:23:20.593 --> 00:23:24.494]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[00:23:24.494 --> 00:23:27.695]  Don't forget, crossbreedholsters.com.
[00:23:30.393 --> 00:23:35.434]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[00:23:35.434 --> 00:23:40.755]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.
[00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:44.496]  Go to MySafeDoor.com right now and watch the amazing video.
[00:23:44.496 --> 00:23:49.937]  At MySafeDoor.com, you'll learn how to turn your home into a fortress with the Door Sentinel.
[00:23:49.937 --> 00:23:54.777]  16 kicks later, and the Door Sentinel is still holding strong.
[00:23:54.777 --> 00:23:56.158]  MySafeDoor.com.
[00:23:56.158 --> 00:23:57.178]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[00:24:18.015 --> 00:24:24.923]  There's nothing like getting connected and about to go live and then getting knocked off and wanting to get back in the ring here.
[00:24:24.923 --> 00:24:35.815]  It's also very, very exciting in a horrifying way to see Forbes and the New York Times coming out and attacking myself by name, InfoWars.com.
[00:24:37.429 --> 00:24:39.371]  The Forbes article, in a way, is almost positive.
[00:24:39.371 --> 00:24:55.284]  I don't know if it's a hit piece or not, because we're called conspiracy terrorists and things, but it does admit that we've been right about gold going up in price, and it does admit that MF Global has disappeared all this money, and so people have a right to be upset, but it uses all the standard clichés.
[00:24:55.284 --> 00:24:56.825]  The headline is not right, though.
[00:24:56.825 --> 00:25:01.609]  We're saying you can't trust the banks, so that's going to elicit the bank run.
[00:25:01.609 --> 00:25:04.171]  That's what always causes the bank run.
[00:25:04.171 --> 00:25:06.173]  You already see people in the last few months pulling their money.
[00:25:07.552 --> 00:25:12.316]  Out of the big six mega banks, and you now see them arresting people that come in and try to get their money out.
[00:25:12.316 --> 00:25:15.719]  When I first heard that a month ago, I thought, this can't be true.
[00:25:15.719 --> 00:25:23.705]  And then I watched YouTube after YouTube after YouTube, where the people would go in, and the cops were waiting, and they would, like, say, you're upset today.
[00:25:23.705 --> 00:25:25.306]  Why are you so upset, ma'am?
[00:25:25.306 --> 00:25:26.347]  They'd be like, I'm not upset.
[00:25:26.347 --> 00:25:27.468]  Give me my money.
[00:25:27.468 --> 00:25:29.129]  They'd be like, you've got to wait.
[00:25:29.129 --> 00:25:29.950]  No, you give it to me now.
[00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.431]  That's a disorderly conduct.
[00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:31.992]  You're out of here.
[00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:43.004]  So many of these poor people that work for the system really think that they're going to hold the system up by engaging in all this tyrannical activity.
[00:25:43.004 --> 00:25:48.046]  The truth is they're going to allow the globalists to end this free republic as it's been known.
[00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:51.428]  Traveling across the West, and I've been out here many times, I've never seen
[00:25:52.208 --> 00:25:53.069]  We're good to go.
[00:26:09.171 --> 00:26:10.272]  We're good to go.
[00:26:39.304 --> 00:26:43.285]  Burger King growling at them, demanding that they give them something to eat.
[00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:45.546]  I mean, it was very, very dystopic.
[00:26:45.546 --> 00:26:47.486]  I've never seen anything like this.
[00:26:47.486 --> 00:26:48.586]  I've been out in the West a lot.
[00:26:48.586 --> 00:26:53.688]  I've never seen the Indian reservations looking more rundown and disheveled.
[00:26:53.688 --> 00:26:57.429]  I've never seen the people looking more dejected and freaked out.
[00:26:57.429 --> 00:27:02.330]  I've never seen more police, more Forest Service people
[00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.410]  Bugging their eyes out.
[00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.251]  The only new cars are government vehicles.
[00:27:07.251 --> 00:27:10.512]  It is really scary.
[00:27:10.512 --> 00:27:12.253]  The things I've seen out here.
[00:27:12.253 --> 00:27:14.313]  And I'm going to be filing more of those reports.
[00:27:14.313 --> 00:27:17.034]  I've probably got 20 video reports I haven't uploaded yet.
[00:27:17.034 --> 00:27:18.715]  You know why?
[00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:20.875]  Because there's no internet out here.
[00:27:20.875 --> 00:27:26.997]  I mean, you get in towns and sit there in a parking lot for an hour trying to upload a four minute clip.
[00:27:26.997 --> 00:27:30.618]  So I'll have to follow most of these as we're driving back to Austin.
[00:27:32.277 --> 00:27:34.138]  Tomorrow evening.
[00:27:34.138 --> 00:27:43.321]  And so I want to challenge everybody out there to be watching Tuesday night at InfoWars.com and Wednesday with the Nightly News.
[00:27:43.321 --> 00:27:47.162]  We've got Mike Adams who's going to be hosting the Nightly News tonight.
[00:27:47.162 --> 00:27:48.342]  It's Aaron Dyche tomorrow.
[00:27:48.342 --> 00:27:50.863]  And I really appreciate the great job they're doing.
[00:27:50.863 --> 00:27:52.303]  Rob Newton did a great job.
[00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:57.385]  It's so good to see other informed people who can in some cases do a better job than I'm doing.
[00:27:57.385 --> 00:27:58.605]  God bless them.
[00:27:58.605 --> 00:27:59.766]  Plus that means more targets.
[00:28:00.806 --> 00:28:05.048]  I don't like being the only B-17 up here dropping bombs on the New World Order.
[00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:28.896]  Aaron, you started getting into the incredible statements by the military regime installed by the globalists, the same folks who have taken our country over for COG, now just machine-gunning men, women, children, arresting anybody that doesn't wear a burka, Sharia law, boy, and putting Al-Qaeda in Libya, and then the new forces say, hey, we're doing what America does.
[00:28:28.896 --> 00:28:29.516]  Incredible, Aaron.
[00:28:30.322 --> 00:28:41.334]  Well, yeah, you've got the tale of two cities going on, because if you're Syria or some other country they want to run over, then every injustice is totally an outrage.
[00:28:41.334 --> 00:28:42.875]  But if you're a U.S.
[00:28:42.875 --> 00:28:51.665]  client state, like Egypt, in the middle of internal civil war, every injustice is just justified because it's just like America.
[00:28:52.205 --> 00:28:54.667]  And the quote here is, we saw the firm stance U.S.
[00:28:54.667 --> 00:29:17.487]  took against Occupy Wall Street people and the German government against green protesters to secure the state, said an Egyptian state television anchor yesterday, and thus the implied justification for what I think now amounts to at least 35 murders just from these recent clashes, all because the military will not give up power in Egypt and they're saying elections would be in 2013 or after?
[00:29:21.173 --> 00:29:34.278]  Amazing, and notice how Anderson Cooper and others endorsed this as the ultimate democracy six months ago, eight months ago, and now they're not even criticizing the mass murder and slaughter because it's purely a globalist system.
[00:29:34.278 --> 00:29:41.501]  Again, every country being taken over by this corporatist Borg, and where all liberties are thrown out the window.
[00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:46.403]  We'll be right back with Gerald Cilente, Aaron Dykes, Jesse Ventura, Max Keiser, and more.
[00:29:46.403 --> 00:29:48.984]  Don't forget InfoWars Nightly News tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.614]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.614 --> 00:29:56.296]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:05.529]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:08.790]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:14.352]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:14.352 --> 00:30:19.973]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:19.973 --> 00:30:22.214]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:23.054]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:23.315]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.315 --> 00:30:23.875]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:24.696]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:24.696 --> 00:30:27.019]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.656 --> 00:30:48.945]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:30:48.945 --> 00:30:58.055]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:06.072]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:12.497]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:31:12.497 --> 00:31:14.779]  Number one, study the past.
[00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:17.161]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:31:17.161 --> 00:31:20.883]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:31:22.017 --> 00:31:25.100]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.943]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:31:28.943 --> 00:31:34.007]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:31:34.007 --> 00:31:38.010]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:41.413]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:31:41.413 --> 00:31:45.296]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:45.896 --> 00:31:50.819]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:31:50.819 --> 00:31:55.442]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:55.442 --> 00:31:59.704]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:31:59.704 --> 00:32:00.885]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:07.829]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:10.131]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.131 --> 00:32:15.534]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:15.734 --> 00:32:18.775]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:18.775 --> 00:32:21.096]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:27.358]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.358 --> 00:32:30.719]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:36.500]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.141]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:39.441]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:39.441 --> 00:32:41.962]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.142 --> 00:32:46.345]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.345 --> 00:32:50.948]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:50.948 --> 00:32:53.550]  That's End of America, the number three dot com.
[00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:57.413]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:57.413 --> 00:32:58.514]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:16.816]  Is it getting better?
[00:33:16.816 --> 00:33:18.481]  Or do you feel the same?
[00:33:22.159 --> 00:33:24.801]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[00:33:24.801 --> 00:33:26.242]  Unless you've got someone to blame.
[00:33:26.242 --> 00:33:28.703]  You've got someone to blame?
[00:33:28.703 --> 00:33:40.531]  Yeah, if you go to InfoWars.com, you can see Forbes blaming Gerald Cilente and I for possible runs on banks and the stock market going down.
[00:33:40.531 --> 00:33:45.575]  Headline, talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for run on banks.
[00:33:45.575 --> 00:33:47.696]  Forbes, they've got someone to blame.
[00:33:47.696 --> 00:33:49.117]  It's not MF Global's fault.
[00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:53.499]  We're good to go.
[00:34:22.335 --> 00:34:26.816]  No, they're blaming the Tucson shooting.
[00:34:26.816 --> 00:34:28.997]  They're blaming Popovsky, the cop killer.
[00:34:28.997 --> 00:34:32.098]  They're blaming this latest thing on the Obama deception.
[00:34:32.098 --> 00:34:36.959]  We've proven over and over again because they're scared to death of it.
[00:34:36.959 --> 00:34:39.580]  They're scared to death of our analysis.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:45.561]  Like the three-year-old saying the emperor's not wearing any clothes and everybody finally points out the obvious.
[00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:47.082]  I'm no rocket scientist.
[00:34:47.082 --> 00:34:50.683]  I know tyranny when it's coming down the road a million miles an hour at me.
[00:34:50.683 --> 00:34:50.943]  Okay?
[00:34:52.105 --> 00:34:58.318]  Now, I want to get Gerald Salente's update on this because as soon as he started blowing the whistle, that caused the dam to break.
[00:34:59.829 --> 00:35:03.791]  It was the straw that broke the camel's proverbial back.
[00:35:03.791 --> 00:35:18.158]  It turned out for almost two weeks, going back to early last week, they had known that massive amounts of money were missing from MF Global that had bought up other solvent firms, like the one that Gerald Cilente had a multi-decade long account with.
[00:35:18.158 --> 00:35:23.500]  By the way, I've now done research, and we have the head of MF Global and others, including federal regulators,
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:32.686]  At the CFTC, who were invested with MF Global, and had to recuse himself, saying that these funds would be guaranteed through a different system, just not FDIC.
[00:35:32.686 --> 00:35:35.068]  So, put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:35:35.068 --> 00:35:37.890]  But here's why Gerald Cilente joins us.
[00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:39.691]  I misspoke at the start of the show.
[00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:45.736]  If you just type MF Global into Google and click News, the first two headlines you get are AP and CNN.
[00:35:45.736 --> 00:35:48.057]  We'll put these on screen.
[00:35:48.057 --> 00:35:50.819]  MF Global missing funds may hit $1.2 billion.
[00:35:52.619 --> 00:35:54.560]  Now that was earlier this morning.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.901]  Now the trustees come out and said, oops, it's more than $1.2 billion.
[00:35:58.901 --> 00:36:01.182]  That's the AP headline.
[00:36:01.182 --> 00:36:12.526]  And I see another one here saying it might be as high as $2 plus billion of the $6 billion that went into bankruptcy with the former globalist Goldman Sachs alumni.
[00:36:12.526 --> 00:36:22.289]  New Jersey mayor with the head of the CFTC invested in it, involved with Corzine, recusing himself a week and a half ago, according to Reuters and Forbes.
[00:36:27.595 --> 00:36:31.479]  TrendsResearch.com and AlexJonesOfInfoWars.com.
[00:36:31.479 --> 00:36:32.640]  It's our fault.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.541]  Aaron Dykes is riding shotgun in the studio.
[00:36:34.541 --> 00:36:35.863]  He'll be popping in.
[00:36:35.863 --> 00:36:38.285]  We've got Gerald till 5 after and then he's leaving.
[00:36:38.285 --> 00:36:40.567]  And then Governor Jesse Ventura is joining us.
[00:36:40.567 --> 00:36:42.008]  Then Max Keiser.
[00:36:42.008 --> 00:36:43.650]  Going to Gerald Cilente.
[00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:49.315]  Gerald, it's now above 1.2 billion and they're telling, now they're talking about more than 50,000 customers.
[00:36:49.315 --> 00:36:49.715]  It was 33,000.
[00:36:49.715 --> 00:36:50.115]  You're not going
[00:36:51.937 --> 00:36:52.378]  We're good to go.
[00:37:03.769 --> 00:37:05.790]  Yeah, I get a kick out of these people.
[00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:07.331]  They say, I should have been smarter.
[00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:08.871]  Yeah, I should have been smarter.
[00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:13.634]  It's like walking down the street and somebody blowing your brains out from behind.
[00:37:13.634 --> 00:37:18.776]  You know, if Jesse James did this, it would be robbery.
[00:37:18.776 --> 00:37:24.719]  But when John Corzine does it, oh, it was just a mistake.
[00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:28.641]  How come this guy isn't being even brought in for questioning?
[00:37:29.506 --> 00:37:37.972]  I just heard Senator Roberts over there saying that it looks like illegal behavior is behind this.
[00:37:37.972 --> 00:37:40.693]  How come he isn't being brought up?
[00:37:40.693 --> 00:37:42.034]  Where's the perp walk?
[00:37:42.034 --> 00:37:47.177]  As I said before, the press is really easy to judge people.
[00:37:48.118 --> 00:37:50.419]  Prejudge them in the media.
[00:37:50.419 --> 00:37:53.761]  You don't even hear Corzine's name come up anymore.
[00:37:53.761 --> 00:38:01.766]  We sent out that press release, Alex, that you have about CME Group, where they said that they guarantee
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.501]  The funds.
[00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:07.104]  And then nobody's ever lost a penny.
[00:38:07.104 --> 00:38:12.929]  It went out to over 45,000 people in the media.
[00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:16.272]  None of the major prostitutes will touch it.
[00:38:16.272 --> 00:38:22.838]  And then I got this letter from this guy, this little worm of a man.
[00:38:22.838 --> 00:38:26.081]  I use the word man loosely.
[00:38:27.495 --> 00:38:32.860]  His name happens to be Jeffrey M. Christensen.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.101]  Christian.
[00:38:34.101 --> 00:38:38.866]  Not to confuse him with Jeffrey Zero Christian.
[00:38:38.866 --> 00:38:45.472]  And here's what he says about me in talking to people like you.
[00:38:45.472 --> 00:38:50.877]  That I'm ignorant, I'm stupid, and I'm delusional.
[00:38:50.877 --> 00:38:52.999]  And self-delusional.
[00:38:54.119 --> 00:39:07.204]  And that Corzine has not done a perp walk because he has not been alleged to have done anything illegal, only incredibly stupid.
[00:39:07.204 --> 00:39:12.306]  Hey, Worm Christian, if you listen, you're incredibly stupid.
[00:39:12.306 --> 00:39:18.289]  And if you want to talk to me like that face-to-face, come on over and let's have a visit.
[00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:20.950]  Because here's the fact, you little worm.
[00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:30.697]  Corzine allegedly has done something that is more than just incredibly stupid.
[00:39:30.697 --> 00:39:33.380]  He has broken the cardinal rule.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:40.806]  You don't go into a customer's private account to go do the firm's gambling.
[00:39:40.806 --> 00:39:41.827]  You get it?
[00:39:42.868 --> 00:39:45.090]  It's as simple as that.
[00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:46.691]  This is robbery.
[00:39:46.691 --> 00:39:49.113]  And no one is calling him out.
[00:39:49.113 --> 00:39:57.720]  Maybe Cosine has, you know, he just held a $35,000 a plate dinner for Obama, a fundraiser.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:03.365]  Maybe he's not showing up because he's preparing a Thanksgiving dinner for us.
[00:40:04.065 --> 00:40:07.886]  You know, so we'll all get a little more turkey to eat.
[00:40:07.886 --> 00:40:13.687]  This little, this little twerp going on and on and on.
[00:40:13.687 --> 00:40:16.027]  And here, you'll love this one, Alex.
[00:40:16.027 --> 00:40:18.588]  This is a beauty.
[00:40:18.588 --> 00:40:32.591]  When anyone stops talking about the trilateral... When a man like him, meaning me, calls others sheeple and speaks of the trilateral commission in the Bilderberg Group,
[00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:36.291]  I know I can stop listening.
[00:40:36.291 --> 00:40:48.383]  Oh, by the way, this little weenie worm guy, Christian, the CPM group, they said gold wasn't going to go up this year.
[00:40:48.383 --> 00:40:49.684]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:49.684 --> 00:40:51.545]  He's so brilliant.
[00:40:51.545 --> 00:40:53.827]  No trilateral commission.
[00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:55.529]  No Bilderberg.
[00:40:55.529 --> 00:40:57.171]  Hey, jerk.
[00:40:58.371 --> 00:41:03.013]  Even go on Wikipedia, look up the names that I was talking about.
[00:41:03.013 --> 00:41:08.296]  Draghi, the new head of the European Central Bank.
[00:41:08.296 --> 00:41:15.259]  Mario Tricodmonte, the new head over there in Italy.
[00:41:15.259 --> 00:41:19.581]  Papademos, over there in Greece.
[00:41:19.581 --> 00:41:22.503]  All members of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:41:23.843 --> 00:41:27.407]  Juan Draghi is a chief cat with the Bilderberg.
[00:41:27.407 --> 00:41:28.789]  It's right there.
[00:41:28.789 --> 00:41:30.531]  This is a conspiracy.
[00:41:30.531 --> 00:41:35.497]  This is guys like him that are probably CIA agents.
[00:41:35.497 --> 00:41:38.861]  Let me stop you right there because this is important.
[00:41:39.642 --> 00:41:41.024]  Here is CNN.
[00:41:41.024 --> 00:41:47.250]  More than 1.2 million in customer funds might be missing from bankrupt broker MF Global.
[00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:49.092]  Now, this is going on three weeks now.
[00:41:49.092 --> 00:41:56.780]  Nearly twice previous estimates of the shortfall, the trustee administering the firm's bankruptcy said Monday.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:59.102]  And that's who they're saying has the accounts.
[00:41:59.102 --> 00:41:59.923]  MF Global is forced
[00:42:00.981 --> 00:42:01.221]  We're good.
[00:42:20.348 --> 00:42:26.436]  All of these Prime Ministers, Presidents, they're all financed or are actual Goldman Sachs operatives.
[00:42:26.436 --> 00:42:32.544]  Even Time Magazine last week said it's a global coup, a coup in Europe by Goldman Sachs, government by banksters.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:57.134]  Four banksters, but again, now here we are three weeks later, going back a week and a half ago, even when we showed these on air, even Reuters and Forbes and others had CFTC acting ahead over this investigation because the head is invested in it, so they had to say, you know, I'm accused, saying this appears to be illegal and something's nefarious.
[00:42:57.874 --> 00:43:06.680]  But now the media just says, well I guess it's more than $700 million, it's more than a billion, it's $1.2 billion, it's more than $1.2 billion.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.843]  And they admit that it's destabilizing the whole market.
[00:43:09.843 --> 00:43:22.352]  If you have over $1.2 billion or whatever it really is, they won't deliver people's money when we're talking about a $800 trillion group in the press release by the CME group that you just mentioned.
[00:43:23.092 --> 00:43:28.820]  Of course they've got to turn it around and have Forbes come out and imply we're the bad guys.
[00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.403]  Folks, no one's bank account is safe.
[00:43:31.403 --> 00:43:33.326]  They've already stolen most of your pension funds.
[00:43:33.326 --> 00:43:35.168]  They've already invested those in derivatives.
[00:43:35.168 --> 00:43:37.011]  Your 401Ks, it's all admitted.
[00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:39.073]  Your Social Security, it was spent decades ago.
[00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:42.136]  Here, everything is falling apart.
[00:43:42.136 --> 00:43:44.258]  We've been in a depression for years.
[00:43:44.258 --> 00:43:45.158]  They keep lying to us.
[00:43:45.158 --> 00:43:48.581]  But going back, Gerald, because I don't want to spend too much time on this guy.
[00:43:48.581 --> 00:43:53.084]  Who is this person you're quoting that was making those asinine statements?
[00:43:53.084 --> 00:43:53.924]  Because over
[00:43:56.726 --> 00:43:59.947]  Some years it's 60, some years it's over 70.
[00:43:59.947 --> 00:44:04.668]  Of the 125 people, 130 or so that are in Bilderberg are Goldman Sachs.
[00:44:04.668 --> 00:44:12.250]  I mean, no one denies now, from the Financial Times of London to Time Magazine, that it's a global government of, for, and by the bankers.
[00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:15.950]  So, I don't want to spend all day on this guy because he's not worth the time.
[00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.751]  Is this some analyst that attacked you?
[00:44:17.751 --> 00:44:18.831]  Who is this person?
[00:44:19.195 --> 00:44:21.578]  This guy's the head of the CPM group.
[00:44:21.578 --> 00:44:22.619]  They're a trading group.
[00:44:22.619 --> 00:44:32.030]  What I'm trying to say, Alex, is they're going to start barraging us with negative news to try to discredit us.
[00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:36.535]  When in the meantime, Corzine, where's Corzine?
[00:44:37.176 --> 00:44:38.957]  Where is this guy?
[00:44:38.957 --> 00:44:54.229]  He's not even... Look, we're, we're... As I said, you know, when Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of allegedly false, you know, uh, of having sex with a maid, boy, the press jumped on that one all over the place, gave him a purple one.
[00:44:54.229 --> 00:44:55.110]  That's how you know it was staged.
[00:44:56.035 --> 00:44:58.417]  Yeah, and now where is Corzine?
[00:44:58.417 --> 00:45:00.458]  How come he's not showing up?
[00:45:00.458 --> 00:45:06.903]  So the reason I'm bringing this up, and you mentioned about Forbes, try this one on everybody.
[00:45:06.903 --> 00:45:10.246]  Go to Forbes, 2009.
[00:45:10.246 --> 00:45:12.588]  They made fun of me then.
[00:45:12.588 --> 00:45:18.012]  One of my assistants at the time cashed out her 401K and bought gold at $700 an ounce.
[00:45:21.055 --> 00:45:23.817]  They said she was overreacting!
[00:45:23.817 --> 00:45:27.220]  Gold is at $1,700 an ounce now!
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.982]  What an overreaction!
[00:45:28.982 --> 00:45:30.783]  And not even a retraction.
[00:45:30.783 --> 00:45:39.531]  They're going to do everything they can do now to try to discredit us, because the whole system is going down, and they misquoted me in there.
[00:45:39.531 --> 00:45:41.572]  It's not really a correction.
[00:45:41.572 --> 00:45:43.414]  You may not have read the Forbes article.
[00:45:43.414 --> 00:45:46.216]  He actually admits that you were right about that.
[00:45:46.216 --> 00:45:48.958]  And so they must be listening and then said, well,
[00:45:50.379 --> 00:45:51.179]  It's a weird article.
[00:45:51.179 --> 00:45:59.141]  I mean, they're kind of framing us for any problems that may come, but then they also admit that you've been right and that I've been right, so you might want to go see that article.
[00:45:59.141 --> 00:46:08.563]  I know you've made a point out of that, but they say that she did it at 900 and that it basically doubled, but I remember it was 700, so it's more than doubled.
[00:46:08.563 --> 00:46:13.624]  But Alex, I want to follow up on this, because it's very important.
[00:46:13.624 --> 00:46:18.365]  They misquoted me and I'm saying this, and the reason I'm going so public with this
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:26.567]  Is that the entire global financial system is melting down?
[00:46:26.567 --> 00:46:28.629]  What's the stocks doing over in Europe?
[00:46:28.629 --> 00:46:31.011]  What are they doing in the United States?
[00:46:31.011 --> 00:46:33.634]  They can't solve these problems.
[00:46:33.634 --> 00:46:34.235]  I said
[00:46:34.895 --> 00:46:47.278]  If your money's with Schwab, if it's with Raymond James, I don't care who it's with, Smith Barney, if this thing collapses, you're gonna get shafted.
[00:46:47.278 --> 00:46:55.359]  Oh, they're gonna tell you that you have insurance, just like the CME said that ours was guaranteed.
[00:46:55.359 --> 00:46:58.520]  Yeah, it'll be guaranteed, and you know when you'll get it?
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.961]  I guarantee you'll get it after you're dead.
[00:47:02.481 --> 00:47:04.826]  Because that's how long it's going to take.
[00:47:04.826 --> 00:47:10.298]  And if you get your money before then, it's going to be devalued into nothing.
[00:47:13.141 --> 00:47:13.381]  I think so.
[00:47:35.194 --> 00:47:38.258]  And this is about physical delivery, as Max Keiser predicted.
[00:47:38.258 --> 00:47:43.425]  They could not deliver the gold to people that had won it in the open market.
[00:47:43.425 --> 00:47:45.107]  And so they simply defaulted.
[00:47:45.107 --> 00:47:49.773]  And instead of even paying you in cash, they just said, you know what?
[00:47:49.773 --> 00:47:50.794]  That's the way it is.
[00:47:50.794 --> 00:47:53.317]  And then now it's kind of creepy to have the biggest
[00:47:54.838 --> 00:48:00.719]  Alex, the CME group, that group over there where that guy Duffy says that they guarantee everything?
[00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:02.080]  They've lost over 2.5 billion dollars.
[00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:21.024]  Inequities share since this thing happens.
[00:48:21.024 --> 00:48:25.005]  I'd like to see it go down to zero.
[00:48:25.005 --> 00:48:26.206]  CME.
[00:48:26.206 --> 00:48:29.987]  Maybe it's the Chicago Mafia enterprise.
[00:48:29.987 --> 00:48:34.688]  Where is the money, Duffy, that you said you were going to guarantee?
[00:48:34.688 --> 00:48:37.909]  How come the prostitutes aren't calling them out on this?
[00:48:37.909 --> 00:48:39.390]  And I'll tell you why.
[00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.311]  Because maybe they don't have the money.
[00:48:42.311 --> 00:48:44.211]  And here's a scenario.
[00:48:44.211 --> 00:48:45.332]  I'm going to give you a scoop.
[00:48:46.452 --> 00:48:58.624]  We're saving this for the top trends of 2011, but I'm letting you know this because of all the listeners there that are faithful to your show and want to know what's going to happen before it happens.
[00:48:58.624 --> 00:49:03.690]  You go back, Alex, to when Obama was elected.
[00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.893]  I said, prepare for a bank holiday.
[00:49:08.399 --> 00:49:12.904]  What happened is I'm doing research in the Corzine thing.
[00:49:12.904 --> 00:49:17.129]  There it pops up with Joe Biden.
[00:49:17.129 --> 00:49:28.202]  You remember he was head of the, he was senator from that state of the loophole state over there in Delaware that gives all these corporations a free ride before he became vice president.
[00:49:28.883 --> 00:49:35.025]  He's out there campaigning for Corzine in his aborted effort to get re-elected as governor.
[00:49:35.025 --> 00:49:47.649]  And Big Joe puts his arm around Corzine and he said, Biden said, you know, it was talk about a bank holiday when we came into office.
[00:49:47.649 --> 00:49:49.130]  They were discussing it.
[00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:53.395]  And we brought in Joe to advise us.
[00:49:53.395 --> 00:49:59.442]  I'm saying this because the entire system is collapsing.
[00:49:59.442 --> 00:50:02.746]  I believe they're going to keep propping it up.
[00:50:03.769 --> 00:50:16.352]  Until after Christmas, so they can sucker everybody in to spending money that they don't have, and buying a lot of Christmas crap that they don't need.
[00:50:16.352 --> 00:50:19.613]  And after that scam is over, BAM!
[00:50:19.613 --> 00:50:21.214]  It's gonna come down.
[00:50:21.214 --> 00:50:29.536]  Because the entire global financial system is collapsing, and if anybody with anything between their heads
[00:50:30.256 --> 00:50:40.640]  Think that Sarkozy, Merkel, Draghi, Papademos are going to solve this problem along with the super committee!
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.861]  I love it!
[00:50:41.861 --> 00:50:43.602]  The super committee!
[00:50:43.602 --> 00:50:47.643]  A house of fools are going to solve this problem.
[00:50:47.643 --> 00:50:50.204]  You're going to get what you deserve.
[00:50:50.204 --> 00:50:51.705]  All right, stay there, Gerald.
[00:50:51.705 --> 00:50:52.705]  Gerald, we'll be right back.
[00:50:52.705 --> 00:50:53.706]  Incredible information.

[00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:57.688]  It's all coming up.

[00:52:00.430 --> 00:52:01.751]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:01.751 --> 00:52:07.337]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:52:07.337 --> 00:52:12.362]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:12.822]  It's true.
[00:52:12.822 --> 00:52:15.645]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:52:15.645 --> 00:52:17.387]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:52:17.907 --> 00:52:23.152]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:52:23.152 --> 00:52:25.455]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[00:52:25.455 --> 00:52:30.259]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:52:30.259 --> 00:52:31.380]  And here's the best part.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.444]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:52:34.444 --> 00:52:37.747]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:52:38.047 --> 00:52:41.248]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:41.248 --> 00:52:43.469]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:52:43.469 --> 00:52:44.409]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:52:44.409 --> 00:52:44.809]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:48.050]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.771]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:00.134 --> 00:53:05.418]  With the economic bad news getting worse each day, are you ready for the hard times ahead?
[00:53:05.418 --> 00:53:08.660]  This is Alex Jones with a special Self Reliance Report.
[00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:22.450]  I've said on this program before that studies show that in a true crisis, 8 out of 10 people will remain sheep-like and passive, frozen like deer in headlights of an oncoming car, waiting for others for help.
[00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.813]  1 out of 10 will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down.
[00:53:27.353 --> 00:53:35.777]  And only 1 out of 10 will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough, dramatically increasing their chances of survival.
[00:53:35.777 --> 00:53:38.778]  Folks, I've just read a new book called Ready for Anything.
[00:53:38.778 --> 00:53:44.540]  It's a must-read for anyone who wants to increase their chances of survival in the coming hard times ahead.

[00:54:12.759 --> 00:54:21.884]  Here's a new headline from The Street.
[00:54:21.884 --> 00:54:24.205]  Super Committee failure won't hit U.S.
[00:54:24.205 --> 00:54:25.726]  rating agency.
[00:54:25.726 --> 00:54:26.807]  Won't lower rating again.
[00:54:26.807 --> 00:54:32.209]  Remember you heard Geithner six months before they lowered it from AAA plus to AAA.
[00:54:32.209 --> 00:54:33.490]  He said there's no way that would happen.
[00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.371]  And of course it did happen.
[00:54:35.371 --> 00:54:37.592]  It just goes on and on.
[00:54:37.592 --> 00:54:40.254]  So this is becoming a huge issue.
[00:54:41.067 --> 00:54:46.411]  And imagine the magnitude of this, where you've got people's own private accounts and they just take them.
[00:54:46.411 --> 00:54:49.214]  And now we learn it's 1.2 billion.
[00:54:49.214 --> 00:54:55.799]  And remember, all these megabanks and brokerage firms have gotten tens of trillions of our taxpayer money, and now they want more, more, more.
[00:54:55.799 --> 00:54:57.620]  At five after, Jesse Ventura is joining us.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:01.523]  We're about to go back to Gerald Celente and get any comments from Aaron Dykes, who's riding shotgun.
[00:55:02.724 --> 00:55:06.627]  But I just also want to point out that Gerald's right.
[00:55:06.627 --> 00:55:10.910]  It's time to support alternative media, which is growing and being attacked, obviously.
[00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:14.632]  It's time to subscribe at TrendsResearch.com.
[00:55:14.632 --> 00:55:23.458]  It's time to get all 18 of my films that are on DVD for $260 off or $99.95 at Infowars.com.
[00:55:23.458 --> 00:55:26.500]  We're on the front lines of the fight against tyranny, and we need your support.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.641]  You know, get The Obama Deception on DVD.
[00:55:28.641 --> 00:55:31.303]  We sell it very inexpensively with expanded extras.
[00:55:31.483 --> 00:55:32.204]  We're good to go.
[00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:58.325]  We've got hosting the Daily News tonight, the health ranger Mike Adams.
[00:55:58.325 --> 00:56:01.346]  He's going to be breaking down some incredible info on the super committee.
[00:56:01.346 --> 00:56:04.487]  Now he's going to control legislation on the farm bill.
[00:56:04.487 --> 00:56:07.048]  Don't need bills originate with individual House members.
[00:56:07.048 --> 00:56:09.488]  We have a 12-member committee with a 13th leader.
[00:56:09.488 --> 00:56:11.069]  Now, Gerald, this is a short segment.
[00:56:11.069 --> 00:56:13.149]  One more coming up.
[00:56:13.149 --> 00:56:20.331]  Looking at this, I mean, it's asinine, the mind job, the con job they do trying to spin it around against us.
[00:56:20.331 --> 00:56:21.532]  Obviously, that's not going to work.
[00:56:23.686 --> 00:56:26.910]  As you said, this is obviously much bigger than what they were first saying.
[00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:28.211]  Where does it go?
[00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:29.772]  How does he get away with this?
[00:56:29.772 --> 00:56:35.858]  You know, they're taking his name out of the news instead of just doing a rehabilitation job because obviously that didn't work.
[00:56:35.858 --> 00:56:45.627]  But when all these heads of federal agencies that protected Madoff for 11 years are caught in bed with Corzine, I mean, I guess at a certain point it's just total criminal takeover.
[00:56:45.627 --> 00:56:46.108]  What do you do?
[00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:54.765]  Well, again, what we're warning is the high probability that there's going to be some type of economic martial law.
[00:56:54.765 --> 00:56:58.929]  And just like I couldn't get my money, this has nothing to do with Corzine.
[00:56:58.929 --> 00:57:02.634]  He's just one of the Goldman Sachs gang.
[00:57:02.634 --> 00:57:07.940]  And the Goldman Sachs gang, as I said on your show, you know, the Rothschilds would be envious.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.124]  To see what the Goldman Sachs reach is.
[00:57:12.124 --> 00:57:15.987]  So what I'm saying is there's going to be some level of martial law.
[00:57:15.987 --> 00:57:17.809]  I'm not economic martial law.
[00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:19.350]  I'm not telling anybody what to do.
[00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:20.671]  I always make this clear.
[00:57:20.671 --> 00:57:21.933]  Think for yourself.
[00:57:21.933 --> 00:57:26.136]  But for me, I'm not having any money where anybody can get their hands on it.
[00:57:26.136 --> 00:57:28.659]  Gold, silver, dollars, I don't care what they are.
[00:57:29.139 --> 00:57:38.246]  And the other thing too Alex, all of those police out there that are beating up and pepper spraying the people, guess what guys?
[00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:39.407]  Now hear this!
[00:57:40.529 --> 00:57:43.271]  You're gonna lose your pensions!
[00:57:43.271 --> 00:57:44.332]  That's right!
[00:57:44.332 --> 00:57:47.595]  You know that retirement that you're looking for?
[00:57:47.595 --> 00:57:49.717]  You're not gonna get it!
[00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:53.040]  Because the whole thing's going down!
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:58:00.066]  And it's not only MF Global, it was Lehman, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, you name it.
[00:58:00.066 --> 00:58:03.389]  One after another that needed to get bailed out or went under.
[00:58:03.389 --> 00:58:05.251]  And your money's gonna go too!
[00:58:05.931 --> 00:58:09.152]  So you're beating up the wrong people!
[00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:18.776]  All you guys that are protecting the Wall Street mob, you should be protecting your family, your friends, and yourself!
[00:58:18.776 --> 00:58:21.717]  Because you're gonna get it, boys!
[00:58:21.717 --> 00:58:31.941]  That baton you're beating people with, you better not send over, because the White Shoe Boys are ready to stick it to you, cops!
[00:58:31.941 --> 00:58:34.162]  They're gonna make mincemeat out of you!

[01:00:01.507 --> 01:00:03.048]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.048 --> 01:00:07.231]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.231 --> 01:00:12.934]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.934 --> 01:00:18.658]  Hi, Jesse Ventura scheduled to be with us with a lot of breaking news and information coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:20.006 --> 01:00:26.890]  Gerald, you were on fire there.
[01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:43.160]  You know what's incredible is they've hired a lot of sociopaths now and I see the police now have an article at InfoWars.com, Gerald, saying that they're now charging people resisting arrest, that if they start beating you with a billy club, you do not cover your face.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.842]  And they're charging people who are in fetal positions now.
[01:00:46.842 --> 01:00:48.443]  That's resisting.
[01:00:48.443 --> 01:00:54.868]  So, I mean, it's like they're trying to put people in life in prison for videotaping cops in public in Illinois.
[01:00:54.868 --> 01:01:00.632]  We have a criminal government, and now the bankers that own it are going to steal everybody's bank accounts.
[01:01:01.292 --> 01:01:09.396]  And even though the cops are going to lose everything, I predict, just because of the uniform and the power trip, a lot of them are going to go ahead and enjoy it and thank their masters.
[01:01:09.396 --> 01:01:14.638]  The good ones are just going to get out, which is part of the plan, so it's a pure army of evil.
[01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:22.221]  I mean, I don't see how, if they put criminals in every position where they can just publicly do all of this, the sky is the limit.
[01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:24.482]  I mean, this is so incredible.
[01:01:24.482 --> 01:01:30.585]  It's so clear, Gerald, that Homeland Security has been set up so the banksters can carry out this orderly gang rape.
[01:01:31.543 --> 01:01:34.945]  You know, Alex, remember the one thing.
[01:01:34.945 --> 01:01:37.847]  People don't like to get it in the pocketbook.
[01:01:37.847 --> 01:01:39.368]  It becomes a gut issue.
[01:01:39.368 --> 01:01:41.009]  An empty gut issue.
[01:01:41.009 --> 01:01:42.090]  Everyone out there.
[01:01:42.952 --> 01:01:44.353]  That's listening.
[01:01:44.353 --> 01:01:52.057]  If you know a cop, let them know that they're not going to be getting their pensions if things continue the way they are.
[01:01:52.057 --> 01:01:57.440]  And the people that are protesting are the ones that are going to save their pensions.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.401]  So just let them know.
[01:01:59.401 --> 01:02:04.344]  The other thing, too, of course, I've been getting warnings, watch for the 3 or 4 a.m.
[01:02:04.344 --> 01:02:07.526]  raid, because they're out to get to take me out.
[01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:21.133]  And then finally, what I really want to make a point on this, Alex, and drive it home, this release we sent out, those CME Group guarantees, there are no guarantees.
[01:02:21.133 --> 01:02:25.115]  Again, it's not the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:28.356]  It appears from what they've written here that the correct
[01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:35.018]  Abbreviation for CME is the Chicago Mafia Enterprise.
[01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:45.448]  Because here's what Duffy, the vice chairman of that company says, I want to make this 100% clear to everyone so you know how you're going to get shafted when it hits you.
[01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:54.090]  Quote, no customer has ever lost a penny as a result of a clearing member default.
[01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:57.712]  More than a penny has been lost, number one.
[01:02:57.712 --> 01:03:13.942]  Number two, quote, since we are the guarantor of every transaction that happens in our markets, we have to guarantee the performance of each and every one of these contracts
[01:03:14.542 --> 01:03:25.490]  To do this, we hold more than $100 billion of collateral to support the transactions that are being done on our markets.
[01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:27.212]  Where's the money?
[01:03:27.212 --> 01:03:29.433]  Where's the guarantee?
[01:03:29.433 --> 01:03:34.137]  I say, either Duffy, put it up, or you don't have it.
[01:03:34.137 --> 01:03:40.822]  Oh, and you cops out there that are beating up people for resisting arrest?
[01:03:40.822 --> 01:03:43.084]  How about going after Corzine?
[01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:45.461]  Mostly warnings.
[01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:06.711]  Mostly warnings.
[01:04:06.711 --> 01:04:08.412]  Watch for the 3 a.m.
[01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:12.114]  raid, because that's when they like to do it.
[01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:16.556]  When you're deep in sleep and your equilibrium is off.
[01:04:16.556 --> 01:04:20.238]  Yeah, there's no suicide in this guy's life.
[01:04:20.238 --> 01:04:21.139]  No, no.
[01:04:21.139 --> 01:04:23.680]  They're gonna come after us, Alex.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:32.185]  The white shoe boys don't like, the money junkies don't like anybody messing with their, to take their fix away from them.
[01:04:32.845 --> 01:04:36.250]  So things are going to get worse before they get better.
[01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:43.979]  And as I said, everyone out there, you know a cop, let them know they're going to get that baton where they're not going to like it.
[01:04:54.696 --> 01:04:55.957]  Tyranny is here.
[01:04:55.957 --> 01:04:59.879]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:04:59.879 --> 01:05:02.281]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:02.281 --> 01:05:07.984]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:07.984 --> 01:05:14.228]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:14.648 --> 01:05:20.630]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:24.811]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:24.811 --> 01:05:29.093]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:35.035]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:35.035 --> 01:05:38.596]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:38.596 --> 01:05:40.557]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:40.997]  It's here.

[01:05:57.482 --> 01:06:02.623]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:02.623 --> 01:06:09.345]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:11.363 --> 01:06:12.305]  We're good to go.
[01:06:19.841 --> 01:06:31.644]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:06:31.644 --> 01:06:33.424]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:33.424 --> 01:06:36.325]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:40.566]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:06:40.566 --> 01:06:42.946]  So you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:06:45.647 --> 01:06:47.227]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:47.227 --> 01:06:48.008]  Got it.
[01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:48.888]  Others don't.
[01:06:50.009 --> 01:06:54.571]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:54.571 --> 01:06:55.492]  Number one.
[01:06:55.492 --> 01:06:58.913]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:58.913 --> 01:06:59.774]  Number two.
[01:06:59.774 --> 01:07:04.656]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:04.656 --> 01:07:05.397]  It's true.
[01:07:05.397 --> 01:07:09.959]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:11.080]  Number 3.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.684]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:14.684 --> 01:07:18.608]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:18.608 --> 01:07:19.389]  Number 4.
[01:07:19.389 --> 01:07:22.151]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:22.151 --> 01:07:25.835]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:26.076]  Number 5.
[01:07:26.616 --> 01:07:30.759]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:30.759 --> 01:07:35.823]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:39.986]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:39.986 --> 01:07:41.787]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:41.787 --> 01:07:46.391]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:52.017 --> 01:07:58.644]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:58.644 --> 01:08:01.628]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:19.971]  I'll be honest with you, ladies and gentlemen, it's pretty creepy to have the New York Times saying my film, The Obama Deception, is responsible for the guy that shot the White House, when all I do is point out that Obama's a puppet and the two-party system's become a fraud.
[01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:32.260]  Or that Forbes has come out and blamed myself and Gerald Salente, saying we're going to cause runs on banks, when mega-brokerage firms are taking people's private accounts, and CNN admits it's destroying confidence.
[01:08:33.285 --> 01:08:34.507]  It's still somehow our fault.
[01:08:34.507 --> 01:08:35.448]  It is so creepy.
[01:08:35.448 --> 01:08:38.754]  I'm going to get Governor Ventura's take on that a lot more.
[01:08:38.754 --> 01:08:42.119]  He joins us to give us the latest on his fight.
[01:08:42.119 --> 01:08:44.163]  Really, it's all of our fight.
[01:08:44.163 --> 01:08:47.127]  Four due process for the 10th Amendment, for the 4th Amendment.
[01:08:47.930 --> 01:08:57.181]  With the TSA now expanding out, they have announced, and I did confirm, we got a tip last week, they are going to be in Mall of America starting next February.
[01:08:57.181 --> 01:09:02.588]  And you'll see this announced in the news probably in January, but I have talked to insiders of Mall of America.
[01:09:02.588 --> 01:09:06.813]  TSA has put out press releases, video press releases, showing them in malls.
[01:09:07.514 --> 01:09:08.095]  I think so.
[01:09:21.397 --> 01:09:27.121]  They're also putting in Jumbotron telescreen saying, don't trust anybody but Big Sis.
[01:09:27.121 --> 01:09:28.342]  So we've got that happening.
[01:09:28.342 --> 01:09:33.185]  We're going to get Governor Ventura's take on the protests, not just here, but overseas.
[01:09:33.185 --> 01:09:38.048]  Egyptian military justifies murder of protesters by pointing to American cops.
[01:09:38.048 --> 01:09:39.689]  That's an actual headline.
[01:09:39.689 --> 01:09:42.291]  Here's another one that breaks it down.
[01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:48.296]  Curling up at a ball to avoid police violence may be considered active resistance.
[01:09:48.296 --> 01:09:59.504]  They've got a police commander here on tape who defended police that beat people in field positions in the head with batons and sprayed them with pepper spray as saying that is resistance to curl up.
[01:09:59.504 --> 01:10:02.987]  If you raise an arm to block when they billy club you, that is resistance.
[01:10:02.987 --> 01:10:05.088]  I mean, this is so comical now.
[01:10:05.088 --> 01:10:05.509]  It's like
[01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:09.078]  Oh, what's that case we saw?
[01:10:09.078 --> 01:10:11.679]  Life in prison for filming police in Illinois.
[01:10:11.679 --> 01:10:15.240]  And I got thrown out of court, but the point is they keep trying it.
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:19.722]  Governor Jesse Ventura, best-selling author, obviously hit TV show Conspiracy Theory.
[01:10:19.722 --> 01:10:24.184]  New season almost complete, being shot coming up next year.
[01:10:24.184 --> 01:10:29.286]  Jesse, what is it like for you, Governor, to... I mean, I feel like I've woken up in the Twilight Zone.
[01:10:31.387 --> 01:10:39.452]  Let me at this from your initial comments of them blaming you and blaming people that take things to the public.
[01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:41.093]  That's an old standard ploy.
[01:10:41.093 --> 01:10:44.394]  That's called kill the messenger, not the message.
[01:10:44.394 --> 01:10:48.137]  You know, they don't want to talk about what you're saying.
[01:10:48.137 --> 01:10:51.499]  They just want to go after you for saying it.
[01:10:51.499 --> 01:10:52.579]  That's a typical ploy.
[01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:55.241]  I don't know.
[01:10:55.241 --> 01:10:57.422]  I'd like to think people are smarter than that.
[01:10:57.422 --> 01:11:00.884]  I'd like to think people see through nonsense like that.
[01:11:00.884 --> 01:11:10.570]  Where when there is a whistleblower, when they attack a whistleblower, well, if there was nothing, if there was no information to give, there wouldn't be whistleblowers.
[01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:14.893]  If there wasn't bad things going on, there wouldn't be whistleblowers.
[01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:18.250]  So, you know, just buckle up on that.
[01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:19.751]  That's the old standard ploy.
[01:11:19.751 --> 01:11:21.491]  Kill the messenger, not the message.
[01:11:21.491 --> 01:11:27.934]  And how they can possibly blame you and people like you who simply, you know, put out information.
[01:11:27.934 --> 01:11:33.556]  Hey, if your information's untrue, well then it'll be untrue and it'll come out through the wash being untrue.
[01:11:33.556 --> 01:11:37.658]  But if it is true, then how can, you know, I wouldn't worry about it.
[01:11:37.658 --> 01:11:39.579]  No, I agree, Governor, but it's just like the National
[01:11:39.599 --> 01:11:39.999]  We're good to go.
[01:12:03.087 --> 01:12:07.172]  Talk show host Alex Jones and guest call for bank runs.
[01:12:07.172 --> 01:12:19.586]  No, we pointed out that they've taken now over a billion two hundred million dollars of people's private accounts at MF Global with the former New Jersey governor Corzine running it and Goldman Sachs all them involved.
[01:12:20.226 --> 01:12:20.606]  I don't know.
[01:12:20.606 --> 01:12:24.808]  I'd like to hope so, but, you know, I'm doing a lot of interviews again dealing with my court case.
[01:12:41.926 --> 01:12:46.048]  And I'm still getting a lot of resistance of people with this attitude.
[01:12:46.048 --> 01:12:53.090]  Well, we haven't been attacked now in 10 years, so it's a good thing what they're doing at airports.
[01:12:53.090 --> 01:12:58.893]  It's a good thing that we're frisking down 95-year-old women and taking their depends.
[01:12:58.893 --> 01:13:06.856]  It's a good thing when we're grabbing in the crotches of little children, because after all, it's keeping us all safe and we haven't been attacked again.
[01:13:07.516 --> 01:13:25.797]  And I mean, these are the people, I don't know if it's the fluoride in the water or what has done it to them, but, you know, they're doing exactly what Ben Franklin warned when Ben Franklin, you know, warned us that those who will give up their liberty for security shall deserve and have neither because
[01:13:26.704 --> 01:13:30.468]  You know, you're not going to be free and be made safe.
[01:13:30.468 --> 01:13:41.899]  People need to understand that that was the great thing about our country, was this Bill of Rights and Constitution that allow you to come here and not be oppressed by government.
[01:13:41.899 --> 01:13:45.203]  Yes, it makes you dependent upon yourself.
[01:13:45.883 --> 01:13:49.768]  You have to have self-reliance to achieve, but that's good.
[01:13:49.768 --> 01:13:55.694]  And for our country to lose that, well then we're nothing special anymore.
[01:13:55.694 --> 01:14:06.186]  And we're losing it because we're allowing judges and we're allowing the judicial system and our elected system and our executive branch to literally trample and destroy.
[01:14:06.206 --> 01:14:07.086]  We're good to go.
[01:14:23.687 --> 01:14:27.771]  And anybody that makes that statement to me, I look at them like they're insane.
[01:14:27.771 --> 01:14:31.153]  Because they obviously, you know, have voices in their heads.
[01:14:31.153 --> 01:14:38.279]  You know, a lot like one of my conspiracies I'm looking into this year is the fact that, are they doing that to people?
[01:14:38.279 --> 01:14:42.643]  Are they putting, you know, sounds and words and thoughts into people's minds?
[01:14:42.643 --> 01:14:44.604]  That's one of our conspiracies.
[01:14:44.604 --> 01:14:46.086]  Well, maybe the answer is true.
[01:14:46.086 --> 01:14:48.708]  Maybe they're doing it to half of the Republican candidates.
[01:14:50.577 --> 01:15:00.020]  They do have systems, as I know you're going to cover on the show, since the 50s.
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:05.682]  In Japan, they have tug machines that, you know, soft drink machines that actually broadcast directly to the inner ear.
[01:15:05.682 --> 01:15:09.644]  And it turns out governments have used those in tests to try to drive people crazy.
[01:15:09.644 --> 01:15:12.525]  But the public's in a trance.
[01:15:12.525 --> 01:15:15.185]  And some of them that have woken up feel powerless.
[01:15:15.185 --> 01:15:16.506]  So they go ahead and say, who cares?
[01:15:16.506 --> 01:15:18.006]  In fact, I'll briefly tell you a story.
[01:15:18.006 --> 01:15:19.367]  I was at the Grand Canyon yesterday.
[01:15:20.444 --> 01:15:21.105]  Governor.
[01:15:21.105 --> 01:15:25.548]  And 14 years ago I've been there and shown how our land had been signed over to the U.N.
[01:15:25.548 --> 01:15:27.709]  as collateral to the big banks.
[01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:29.611]  Just like they've done in Greece and places.
[01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:32.232]  So I went back to the Visitor Center to show the plaque.
[01:15:32.232 --> 01:15:37.957]  They've torn down the old Visitor Center, built a giant sprawling complex, but there's the plaque still.
[01:15:37.957 --> 01:15:43.621]  And I start shooting a video, one minute in, a guy walks up with a blues
[01:15:44.486 --> 01:15:47.949]  Uh, windbreaker on with American flags and stuff all over it.
[01:15:47.949 --> 01:15:49.070]  And he stops.
[01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.911]  There's nobody around me.
[01:15:49.911 --> 01:15:50.852]  I'm out there in the parking lot.
[01:15:50.852 --> 01:15:53.614]  He stops while I'm shooting a video, one minute in.
[01:15:53.614 --> 01:15:55.376]  It's up on YouTube right now.
[01:15:55.376 --> 01:15:57.137]  And he says, hold on, honey.
[01:15:57.137 --> 01:15:58.739]  I gotta see what this guy's saying.
[01:15:58.739 --> 01:16:00.761]  And he goes, oh, this guy needs to shut up.
[01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:02.642]  You know, I want to take a photo of this.
[01:16:02.642 --> 01:16:08.468]  And he steps in front of me because he didn't like hearing me talk about the UN and the global banks.
[01:16:08.468 --> 01:16:09.689]  He didn't want to believe that
[01:16:10.029 --> 01:16:10.831]  I don't want to hear it.
[01:16:23.795 --> 01:16:24.675]  What'd you say, Gus?
[01:16:24.675 --> 01:16:28.496]  I said he believes patriotism is going along to get along.
[01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:29.377]  Yes, that's it.
[01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:31.237]  You know, and that's the worst thing.
[01:16:31.237 --> 01:16:35.599]  I mean, Tom Jefferson told us dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.
[01:16:35.599 --> 01:16:45.342]  I can tell you, in all my experience of being a mayor and a governor, they govern best when the public participates.
[01:16:45.342 --> 01:16:51.484]  They govern best when the public criticizes and puts them under the microscope.
[01:16:51.484 --> 01:16:52.664]  They govern worst
[01:16:53.522 --> 01:16:59.325]  When they're allowed to do what they want and the public becomes apathetic and the public doesn't care.
[01:16:59.325 --> 01:17:02.466]  That's when you will get your worst government.
[01:17:02.466 --> 01:17:06.788]  You get your best government when you hold their feet to the fire.
[01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:09.009]  And people better wake up to that.
[01:17:09.009 --> 01:17:14.112]  If they throw their hands up in the air and say, well, there's nothing I can do about it.
[01:17:14.112 --> 01:17:17.733]  Well, that's exactly the reaction that they want you to do.
[01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:20.795]  You're playing right into their game when you do that.
[01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:32.938]  You know, I saw a film a few months ago called The Conspirators, and it's basically a true story about Robert Redford about the trial after the killing of Lincoln at the Ford Theater.
[01:17:32.938 --> 01:17:35.660]  And I forget the name of the briefing, but callers have made that point.
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:37.081]  It's not popping in my head at the minute.
[01:17:37.521 --> 01:17:52.648]  But there is a system, and it's shown at the end of the film, Governor, where they go ahead and Stanton, the Secretary of Defense, or War, goes ahead and orders the woman executed, even though she's been found not guilty by the military tribunal, and
[01:17:57.330 --> 01:18:07.612]  Basically, it's kicked up past the tribunal to a higher judge to call for another trial, but Stanton ignores that and hangs her.
[01:18:07.612 --> 01:18:11.033]  But they have the term there, and I looked it up in federal law.
[01:18:11.033 --> 01:18:18.155]  There is a way, even if that judge sat on that and claimed that, that your lawyer can kick it up and force the tribunal
[01:18:18.855 --> 01:18:25.499]  To at least respond to it and say they'll hear it or not and then put something public on the record.
[01:18:25.499 --> 01:18:27.140]  Has your lawyer talked about that?
[01:18:27.140 --> 01:18:33.163]  No, because it's a catch-22 because there's also something they don't tell you in my case.
[01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:39.547]  The day you file the lawsuit, you have 60 days in which to appeal it.
[01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:47.317]  Well, the judge sat on it for six months before she had the hearing, and then three more months before she ruled on it.
[01:18:47.317 --> 01:18:51.799]  So if I take it to the Court of Appeals, it gives them the perfect way out.
[01:18:51.799 --> 01:18:58.262]  All they have to do then is rule while the statute of limitations ran out.
[01:18:58.262 --> 01:19:01.924]  Incredible, but I mean, I think it's two years, that's more like a year and a half ago.
[01:19:01.924 --> 01:19:03.324]  You can't win either way.
[01:19:03.324 --> 01:19:06.586]  The point is, Alex, the bottom line is this.
[01:19:06.586 --> 01:19:08.027]  Our government does not
[01:19:08.749 --> 01:19:16.214]  Respect us, the citizens, enough to allow us to make a decision on what's constitutional and what is not.
[01:19:16.214 --> 01:19:16.974]  You're right.
[01:19:16.974 --> 01:19:22.818]  They do not want any constitutional issue going before a jury.
[01:19:22.818 --> 01:19:25.480]  Because they cannot control a jury.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:32.904]  And if a jury rules in the favor in my case, well that could open up Pandora's box on them.
[01:19:32.904 --> 01:19:35.506]  Because then there would be a precedence in court.
[01:19:35.506 --> 01:19:37.227]  So the easiest way to defend
[01:19:37.227 --> 01:19:37.908]  Yes sir, stay there.
[01:19:37.908 --> 01:19:38.429]  Stay there, Gov.
[01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:53.692]  As we age, we lose both strength and muscle mass.
[01:19:53.692 --> 01:19:59.757]  Undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows is nature's most powerful food to gain back lost muscle.
[01:19:59.757 --> 01:20:05.181]  Virtually all whey protein powders or drinks have been damaged during processing or are high in sugar.
[01:20:05.181 --> 01:20:11.306]  This damaged whey causes a significant loss in the ability of the body to build new muscle proteins.
[01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:16.370]  The high sugar content will stop all the benefits of your growth hormone from causing muscle repair.
[01:20:17.131 --> 01:20:17.491]  I think so.
[01:20:34.921 --> 01:20:43.745]  Go to OneWorldWay.com, that's OneWorldWhey.com to read or hear some impressive testimonies to this effect.
[01:20:43.745 --> 01:20:49.468]  Or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[01:20:49.468 --> 01:20:54.390]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:56.251]  Are you gaining fat, feeling tired?
[01:20:56.471 --> 01:20:58.553]  Losing desire in the bedroom?
[01:20:58.553 --> 01:21:00.194]  Get back in the game!

[01:21:22.293 --> 01:21:24.434]  And yes, a healthy sex drive.
[01:21:24.434 --> 01:21:26.735]  The results are life-changing.
[01:21:26.735 --> 01:21:28.415]  Beware of cheap knockoffs.

[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:39.340]  1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:50.504 --> 01:21:55.766]  With the economic bad news getting worse each day, are you ready for the hard times ahead?
[01:21:55.766 --> 01:21:59.007]  This is Alex Jones with a special Self Reliance Report.
[01:21:59.007 --> 01:22:12.791]  I've said on this program before that studies show that in a true crisis, 8 out of 10 people will remain sheep-like and passive, frozen like deer in headlights of an oncoming car, waiting for others for help.
[01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:17.172]  1 out of 10 will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down.
[01:22:17.712 --> 01:22:26.143]  And only one out of ten will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough, dramatically increasing their chances of survival.
[01:22:26.143 --> 01:22:29.146]  Folks, I've just read a new book called Ready for Anything.

[01:23:53.115 --> 01:24:02.323]  We're digging into a host of other issues with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Mattura.
[01:24:02.323 --> 01:24:10.870]  You can get his best-selling book that's amazing, 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read, at Infowars.com or bookstores everywhere.
[01:24:10.870 --> 01:24:14.293]  And by the way, Governor, you've also got your own site.
[01:24:14.293 --> 01:24:15.414]  We'll plug that here in a moment.
[01:24:16.135 --> 01:24:24.798]  The governor hit something key when I was flying out of Las Vegas a month ago and I was out there shooting some interviews and doing some investigations with Ventura, with Jesse.
[01:24:24.798 --> 01:24:31.481]  When I'm flying out, you know, they had me in the business class so I got to go to the short line, but everybody's body scanned at that one.
[01:24:31.481 --> 01:24:32.021]  I didn't know that.
[01:24:32.561 --> 01:24:37.763]  So I come out on the other end of the trap and I say, I'm not body scanning.
[01:24:37.763 --> 01:24:38.723]  So they call me over.
[01:24:38.723 --> 01:24:40.484]  I start telling them that's going to give you cancer.
[01:24:40.484 --> 01:24:41.945]  They're like, no it isn't.
[01:24:41.945 --> 01:24:44.125]  And then he says, I've got to do this.
[01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:45.726]  It's my administrative right.
[01:24:45.726 --> 01:24:50.968]  Or you're going to face the other consequences, which are now they try to arrest you and stuff.
[01:24:51.608 --> 01:24:51.988]  I think so.
[01:25:11.738 --> 01:25:12.418]  Well, that's just it.
[01:25:12.418 --> 01:25:14.499]  It's called, you hit the nail on the head, Alex.
[01:25:14.499 --> 01:25:18.360]  I learned from my court case, it's called an administrative law ruling.
[01:25:34.716 --> 01:25:38.883]  And it was back in the days of Woodrow Wilson when they created the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:38.883 --> 01:25:44.433]  As we all know, our Constitution clearly states there will be no central bank.
[01:25:45.327 --> 01:25:52.590]  So the way they looped that was Wilson back then created these administrative law rulings that the President does.
[01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:58.813]  And apparently our courts have let them stand up to where they looped the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:25:58.813 --> 01:26:10.698]  And that's how their TSA is able to do, and this guy's able to say that to you because what happened was George Bush did the same thing in creating the TSA.
[01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:14.700]  He did it under a presidential thing where he signs it
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:20.542]  And therefore it makes it exempt from the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.
[01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.562]  It allows it to loop the law.
[01:26:22.562 --> 01:26:25.343]  It's called an Administrative Law Ruling.
[01:26:25.343 --> 01:26:34.486]  And that's exactly the essence of my court case of why I am not allowed to go to court to determine whether my Fourth Amendment rights are being violated.
[01:26:34.486 --> 01:26:37.107]  And here's all they do.
[01:26:37.107 --> 01:26:38.908]  The Congress then passes this.
[01:26:39.828 --> 01:26:46.612]  And gives the TSA the ruling of, okay, go make our airports safe.
[01:26:46.612 --> 01:26:51.856]  Well, when they give them that instruction, that means they've got carte blanche.
[01:26:51.856 --> 01:27:02.262]  They can do anything they want to do to allegedly make the airports safe, and you have no control, you have no Constitution or Bill of Rights protection at airports?
[01:27:03.002 --> 01:27:11.165]  And the other thing that's unique about it is, like it was stated by my attorney, and here's another interesting thing, Alex.
[01:27:11.165 --> 01:27:17.987]  When they rule against you, as what Federal Judge Nelson did to me, they don't even do it face to face.
[01:27:17.987 --> 01:27:19.168]  They send you an email.
[01:27:20.623 --> 01:27:23.907]  I mean, how pathetic and how cowardly is that?
[01:27:23.907 --> 01:27:26.610]  They won't even bring you into court.
[01:27:26.610 --> 01:27:30.655]  Sit down, look you in the eye, and tell you why you can't go to court.
[01:27:30.655 --> 01:27:34.639]  They send you an email, but let me read what the order of the mild attorney.
[01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:40.566]  He said, her order dismissing our case for lack of jurisdiction reads much like the government's brief.
[01:27:41.347 --> 01:27:57.834]  And does not directly address the gist of our argument regarding the constitutional absurdity of being subject to a secret order that can be changed in secret at any time and without notice and cannot be challenged in a district court.
[01:27:59.082 --> 01:27:59.963]  Unbelievable.
[01:27:59.963 --> 01:28:02.924]  Now, that's, he ruled in favor of that.
[01:28:02.924 --> 01:28:07.667]  And so, when you go to an airport, you don't even know what the rules are.
[01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:10.369]  They don't even have to tell you.
[01:28:10.369 --> 01:28:17.152]  So you got all these little guys like that guy you ran into, who are kings of their own domain.
[01:28:17.152 --> 01:28:19.374]  In essence, he can do anything he wants there.
[01:28:20.314 --> 01:28:22.936]  And you can't know the rules.
[01:28:22.936 --> 01:28:24.857]  He can grope you anywhere.
[01:28:24.857 --> 01:28:27.479]  He can take you in the back room.
[01:28:27.479 --> 01:28:30.901]  Hey, if I was a pedophile, I'd get a job doing this in a minute.
[01:28:49.974 --> 01:28:51.597]  They have their authorization.
[01:28:51.597 --> 01:28:58.287]  They'll do it with these administrative law rulings until we as a people stand up and tell them enough of this.
[01:28:58.287 --> 01:28:59.489]  Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:28:59.489 --> 01:29:00.410]  We're in a due process.
[01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:01.071]  Russia, China.
[01:29:02.856 --> 01:29:04.017]  What's that?
[01:29:04.017 --> 01:29:15.022]  Exactly, I'm saying no due process, worse than China, and they just say administratively we say you can't fly, and now they're saying they're going to have an administrative no-gun-by list, Governor.
[01:29:15.022 --> 01:29:16.703]  I wouldn't doubt it for a minute.
[01:29:16.703 --> 01:29:25.267]  Every one of our constitutional Bill of Rights is being assaulted by our very elected officials, by them allowing them to do this.
[01:29:25.267 --> 01:29:30.830]  I want to finish up with this to get into JFK anniversary, all this stuff coming up, stay with us.
[01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:31.070]  Jesse?
[01:29:39.827 --> 01:29:43.750]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:51.577]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.577 --> 01:29:53.318]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:29:53.318 --> 01:29:58.622]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:29:58.622 --> 01:30:00.164]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:00.164 --> 01:30:08.931]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:09.671 --> 01:30:17.193]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:17.193 --> 01:30:25.196]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:25.196 --> 01:30:30.437]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:30:30.437 --> 01:30:32.598]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:30:51.457 --> 01:30:55.460]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.722]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:30:58.722 --> 01:31:03.525]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:03.525 --> 01:31:09.889]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:09.889 --> 01:31:12.131]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:12.811]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:12.991]  Bernanke?
[01:31:12.991 --> 01:31:13.512]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:13.512 --> 01:31:14.172]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:14.172 --> 01:31:16.294]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:31.587 --> 01:31:33.429]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:33.429 --> 01:31:35.951]  And right now in Washington D.C.
[01:31:35.951 --> 01:31:38.853]  we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:32:53.667 --> 01:33:05.916]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:33:05.916 --> 01:33:07.497]  We're going to get into a host of other issues.
[01:33:07.497 --> 01:33:10.299]  Aaron Dykstra is also up there at the network riding shotgun.
[01:33:10.299 --> 01:33:15.042]  I know he's going to pop in in a few minutes with a question for Jesse Ventura on the TSA.
[01:33:15.042 --> 01:33:20.226]  Aaron has to fly a lot shooting interviews for my films, and believe me, he used to like to travel.
[01:33:20.226 --> 01:33:22.107]  Now he's like, do I have to go on the road?
[01:33:23.115 --> 01:33:25.859]  At a certain point I have to morally say, no you don't.
[01:33:25.859 --> 01:33:28.222]  Here's the company RV.
[01:33:28.222 --> 01:33:30.445]  But now they're going to set up highway checkpoints.
[01:33:30.445 --> 01:33:37.835]  Now, this dovetails into the protesters being attacked, the Bill of Rights under attack, all of it with Governor Ventura.
[01:33:37.835 --> 01:33:40.158]  But the heart of the matter is this administrative lob.
[01:33:41.224 --> 01:33:48.270]  They set up the CIA in 47 and said it would be reviewable by Congress but would be basically above the law.
[01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:52.794]  Now when the EPA shuts down selective power plants that aren't part of the insiders...
[01:33:54.162 --> 01:34:06.749]  They declare that it's administrative, that Congress has given them a blank check, but all of the common law and all the federal rulings until about the 50s and 60s stated this stuff is not even law, it's a fraud.
[01:34:06.749 --> 01:34:15.754]  So they just have made up, trumped baloney that they then slap on top and do things that the most authoritarian states don't even do.
[01:34:16.754 --> 01:34:19.917]  And now they're saying they're going to have a no-gun-by list, folks.
[01:34:19.917 --> 01:34:20.638]  Are you ready for that?
[01:34:20.638 --> 01:34:21.959]  You didn't do anything wrong.
[01:34:21.959 --> 01:34:22.900]  No judge, no jury.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:24.021]  You're not a felon.
[01:34:24.021 --> 01:34:25.502]  You're on the list.
[01:34:25.502 --> 01:34:32.108]  TSA says they want to have a system where you don't get a job unless they authorize you to have one.
[01:34:32.108 --> 01:34:36.372]  This is a total and complete federal power grab.
[01:34:36.372 --> 01:34:38.934]  Governor Ventura, I mean, how far can this
[01:34:40.916 --> 01:34:42.297]  I would think so, you know.
[01:34:42.297 --> 01:34:45.718]  It'll go as far as we allow them to go with it, because ultimately, Alex, it's our fault.
[01:35:04.352 --> 01:35:04.892]  It is.
[01:35:04.892 --> 01:35:16.418]  You know, and for being laissez-faire, for being asleep at the wheel, whatever you want to say, for not being concerned, for living in our own little lives and not paying attention to what they're doing.
[01:35:16.418 --> 01:35:20.940]  So, whatever happens to this country is ultimately the people's fault.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:23.921]  Now, but you still can't blame them solely.
[01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:30.364]  There are some dastardly people that are running our country, and dastardly people that are in control of the power.
[01:35:31.745 --> 01:35:37.667]  You know, it's very frustrating because you think no one's out there listening.
[01:35:37.667 --> 01:35:43.648]  You think no one cares because everyone just sits back and accepts it like lemmings.
[01:35:43.648 --> 01:35:46.209]  You know, no one voices any concern.
[01:35:46.209 --> 01:35:56.872]  Again, I would love to see the day where everyone would boycott the airport in protest, but you can't get people to do that because they think they've been made safe.
[01:35:57.774 --> 01:36:03.919]  They think that because of 9-11, this is required in airports to keep us safe.
[01:36:03.919 --> 01:36:16.110]  And it's gonna spill out of the airports, and it's gonna spill into everybody's life, and I guess nobody's gonna truly believe it until they come up to your home without a warrant, and they come inside to search it.
[01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:19.973]  And then I've even had people say to me, well, I've got nothing to hide.
[01:36:19.973 --> 01:36:22.135]  Why should I care if they do that?
[01:36:24.016 --> 01:36:28.941]  You know, that's the attitude you got out there amongst a great deal of people, Alex.
[01:36:28.941 --> 01:36:30.783]  Well, I'm not a criminal.
[01:36:30.783 --> 01:36:32.185]  I don't care what they do.
[01:36:32.185 --> 01:36:33.827]  I have nothing to hide.
[01:36:33.827 --> 01:36:42.456]  Exactly, but what about government in history, the horrible things it does when it's not kept on a short leash, as our founders of Common Sense pointed out?
[01:36:42.456 --> 01:36:44.598]  But think about the precept, the idea,
[01:36:45.179 --> 01:36:55.165]  That anywhere there's a potential danger, government has a right to put its hands on you, to stop you, to arrest you, to keep you safe.
[01:36:55.165 --> 01:36:57.546]  I guess you can't ride a horse, you might fall off and get killed.
[01:36:57.546 --> 01:36:58.827]  You can't go surfing.
[01:36:58.827 --> 01:37:01.769]  That used to be the greatness of this country.
[01:37:01.769 --> 01:37:07.432]  The greatness of this country was the fact that you could come here and be self-reliant.
[01:37:07.432 --> 01:37:10.794]  That you wouldn't have a government hovering over your head.
[01:37:11.695 --> 01:37:15.018]  And that yes, we'll stumble and make mistakes.
[01:37:15.018 --> 01:37:16.781]  Yes, things will happen.
[01:37:16.781 --> 01:37:19.944]  But it's like what I used to say when I was governor.
[01:37:19.944 --> 01:37:21.927]  You can't legislate stupidity!
[01:37:23.129 --> 01:37:24.890]  People will do stupid things.
[01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:26.432]  That's also part of freedom.
[01:37:26.432 --> 01:37:28.674]  The freedom to be stupid.
[01:37:28.674 --> 01:37:30.515]  You have freedom to be smart.
[01:37:30.515 --> 01:37:32.697]  And freedom goes both ways.
[01:37:32.697 --> 01:37:38.561]  And you can't sit back and jury pick what you're going to be free and what's not going to be free.
[01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:41.103]  Well, it gives the feds an excuse to go everywhere.
[01:37:41.103 --> 01:37:42.965]  If there's a shadowy enemy they can't defeat.
[01:37:42.965 --> 01:37:44.546]  But let me tell you a quick story and get your take on it.
[01:37:44.546 --> 01:37:49.290]  And then Aaron Dykes has got a question, who's up there in the studio in Austin.
[01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:50.331]  Or I guess down there.
[01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:51.192]  I'm up here in Utah.
[01:37:52.654 --> 01:37:57.635]  I went to Meteor Crater, where one of the biggest meteors ever hit the Earth.
[01:37:57.635 --> 01:38:00.356]  And when I'd been there as a child, they let us hike down to the bottom.
[01:38:00.356 --> 01:38:05.017]  And the guy said, nope, because of lawsuits, even if you sign a form, lawyers still sue.
[01:38:05.017 --> 01:38:08.098]  They've taken the diving boards out of the swimming pools.
[01:38:08.098 --> 01:38:10.058]  They're taking the metal slides out everywhere.
[01:38:10.058 --> 01:38:11.998]  They're taking the merry-go-rounds out.
[01:38:11.998 --> 01:38:13.639]  Then I get to the Grand Canyon.
[01:38:13.639 --> 01:38:15.819]  And I said, these areas were open when I was in college.
[01:38:15.819 --> 01:38:16.559]  They go, not now.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:25.284]  They're even talking about getting rid of the mule rides, where you can't do that because somebody might get hurt sometime.
[01:38:25.284 --> 01:38:35.711]  And then I got to Monument Valley, Utah, and I hadn't read the fine print, and they said, oh, you're not allowed to go in 90-plus percent unless it's on a little truck, and you can't really get off.
[01:38:35.711 --> 01:38:40.134]  You could just go to the front of it and look at them, because somebody might get hurt.
[01:38:40.134 --> 01:38:46.918]  And, I mean, literally, this country is going beyond charities we've seen over the years, and it's this nanny stuff.
[01:38:46.918 --> 01:38:48.279]  Why do you think that was after you in Mexico?
[01:38:49.204 --> 01:38:50.286]  Yeah.
[01:38:50.286 --> 01:38:55.292]  I go to things down there called the bloodless bullfights, where they don't hurt the bull.
[01:38:55.292 --> 01:38:57.355]  You still have the matador.
[01:38:57.355 --> 01:39:02.101]  The matador's in danger, but the bull isn't harmed at all, and so I don't have a problem with that.
[01:39:02.101 --> 01:39:06.708]  Well, one of the things, they do things in Mexico you wouldn't dare do here.
[01:39:07.739 --> 01:39:13.961]  Like, they got a thing where they take two people out of the crowd and they put them on a teeter-totter, you know, that goes up and down?
[01:39:13.961 --> 01:39:14.401]  Yeah.
[01:39:14.401 --> 01:39:19.902]  Only this one also circles like a propeller, and then they let a bull loose.
[01:39:19.902 --> 01:39:24.564]  And the bull charges, so you gotta go up when the bull goes underneath ya.
[01:39:24.564 --> 01:39:25.764]  I mean, it's hilarious.
[01:39:25.764 --> 01:39:31.986]  I turned to my wife, I said, oh my God, could you imagine if somebody proposed this in the United States?
[01:39:33.038 --> 01:39:39.020]  See, I like living in Mexico because down there you're kind of on your own.
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:56.006]  And if you do something stupid, like if I go out surfing alone and I hit my head on the board and I drown out there, all the Mexican people, they're going to feel bad for me and they're going to probably say a prayer for me and all that stuff, but ultimately they're going to say, what a big dummy he was.
[01:39:56.006 --> 01:39:58.107]  Why would you think of going swimming alone?
[01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:00.670]  Exactly.
[01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:02.291]  I mean, that's what freedom is all about.
[01:40:02.291 --> 01:40:04.212]  And as you've said, you'd rather face the danger.
[01:40:04.212 --> 01:40:05.373]  Exactly.
[01:40:05.373 --> 01:40:08.095]  Than lose my freedoms.
[01:40:08.095 --> 01:40:20.983]  I would rather be able to go be stupid and go out into the water alone and kill myself than to have the army or the police on shore saying nobody's allowed to swim because you might kill yourself.
[01:40:20.983 --> 01:40:24.685]  Well, that's always the greatest danger as well.
[01:40:24.685 --> 01:40:27.366]  Aaron Dykes, I believe Aaron's riding shotgun there.
[01:40:27.366 --> 01:40:28.247]  Aaron, you had a question
[01:40:29.588 --> 01:40:53.912]  Yeah I did and I wanted to go back to the great quote from Benjamin Franklin that he brought up regarding if you trade your liberty for security you end up with neither and how many things have we been asked to compromise our liberty on under the name of national security and the rest of it where safety cannot be guaranteed and with that in mind I ask how long has the government known that these x-ray body scanners are dangerous?
[01:40:55.094 --> 01:40:57.657]  I don't think they've ever done proper testing at all.
[01:40:57.657 --> 01:41:00.180]  If it's so sick, you know who put them in?
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:01.241]  Chertoff.
[01:41:01.241 --> 01:41:01.742]  Yeah.
[01:41:01.742 --> 01:41:03.604]  Yeah, but I've got a- He's paid big money.
[01:41:03.604 --> 01:41:05.406]  He works for them now.
[01:41:05.406 --> 01:41:07.869]  This was your typical Halliburton payola.
[01:41:08.476 --> 01:41:21.464]  But the reason I bring that up is because I've got a report here from earlier this month that the government studied these x-ray body scanners in 1998 and found that they were dangerous and could cause up to 100 cases of cancer a year.
[01:41:21.464 --> 01:41:22.925]  How's that for keeping us safe?
[01:41:22.925 --> 01:41:23.986]  Yeah, there you go!
[01:41:23.986 --> 01:41:25.767]  See, they're gonna kill you the slow way!
[01:41:27.489 --> 01:41:38.394]  It's going to be people being multiple x-rayed every week until they finally catch cancer or get a tumor and die within a half a year.
[01:41:38.394 --> 01:41:41.256]  Well, that's what happened in Vegas.
[01:41:41.256 --> 01:41:42.616]  I just abbreviated what happened.
[01:41:42.616 --> 01:41:44.257]  I said, listen, I'm not going through that.
[01:41:44.257 --> 01:41:45.898]  That increases cancer.
[01:41:45.898 --> 01:41:47.819]  I've seen even the articles in the New York Times.
[01:41:48.639 --> 01:41:52.042]  And they're like, no, John Hopkins says it's safe.
[01:41:52.042 --> 01:42:01.250]  And I looked at the guy and I said, John Hopkins, head of radiology, went public and said he never talked to them and did do a study for the government and found massive increases in radiation.
[01:42:01.250 --> 01:42:04.433]  And the guy responds and goes, this is a second generation, it's safe.
[01:42:04.433 --> 01:42:07.135]  And I rattled off the name of it and said, no, you're wrong.
[01:42:07.135 --> 01:42:13.241]  They've got an eight-year study at Boston Logan where they first put these in, a seven-fold increase in cancer clusters.
[01:42:13.641 --> 01:42:18.406]  Well, it's a case, too, of, like, I was so proud of that big Marine during the Wall Street protest.
[01:42:33.260 --> 01:42:44.483]  That stood out there with his Iraq ribbons on, on his shirt, and he looked at those police, the Storm Troopers, who were getting ready to do in the protesters if they could, and he challenged them.
[01:42:44.483 --> 01:42:46.583]  He said, where is your honor?
[01:42:46.583 --> 01:42:47.864]  Where is your honor?
[01:42:47.864 --> 01:42:56.366]  And I say that to any policeman out there, any military person out there, remember you take an oath to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:42:57.842 --> 01:42:59.644]  And always remember your honor.
[01:42:59.644 --> 01:43:03.007]  Is your honor more important or is it your job?
[01:43:03.007 --> 01:43:06.810]  Well, you know, Governor, that's a really good point.
[01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:18.821]  If the Constitution is dead, and that's what they teach now at the federal level, if it's dead, why do they still swear an oath to it to defend it from enemies foreign and domestic?
[01:43:19.622 --> 01:43:21.903]  We've only got some domestic enemies.
[01:43:21.903 --> 01:43:26.265]  Oh, we've got huge domestic enemies against the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:43:26.265 --> 01:43:32.148]  The majority of the leaders of our country seem to be that way, or who's ever in charge running the departments.
[01:43:32.148 --> 01:43:34.249]  It may not be the elected people.
[01:43:34.249 --> 01:43:38.852]  Maybe this feels like Colonel Prouty said in his book, The Secret Team.
[01:43:39.612 --> 01:43:40.874]  Look at Europe, Jesse.
[01:43:40.874 --> 01:43:41.434]  They're saying...
[01:43:54.910 --> 01:43:57.233]  Whatever they want to call it, but I'll tell you.
[01:44:09.927 --> 01:44:14.788]  That's why people got to support this movement against Wall Street.
[01:44:14.788 --> 01:44:17.329]  It's not a movement against capitalism.
[01:44:17.329 --> 01:44:23.670]  It's not a movement to make us communist, which is what mainstream media tries to portray it.
[01:44:23.670 --> 01:44:32.213]  What it simply is, it's a movement stating, Wall Street, stop corporations, stop buying our politicians.
[01:44:32.213 --> 01:44:33.613]  Because unfortunately, Alex,
[01:44:34.253 --> 01:44:38.415]  I'll be the one to say this on the record as a former military person.
[01:44:38.415 --> 01:44:41.376]  You don't serve the people of the United States anymore.
[01:44:41.376 --> 01:44:44.698]  You don't serve the Constitution or the Bill of Rights.
[01:44:44.698 --> 01:44:48.440]  Our military is the muscle for the corporate power.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.922]  If they can't beat them in the corporate boardrooms, then they'll send in the U.S.
[01:44:52.922 --> 01:44:53.122]  Marines.
[01:44:54.457 --> 01:44:56.599]  Well, that's what Smetley Butler said 80 years ago.
[01:44:56.599 --> 01:44:58.061]  Exactly.
[01:44:58.061 --> 01:45:00.824]  It's been going on for a hundred years.
[01:45:00.824 --> 01:45:01.925]  Nothing has changed.
[01:45:01.925 --> 01:45:05.689]  All these wars are not wars for freedom.
[01:45:05.689 --> 01:45:07.711]  They're wars of corporate greed.
[01:45:07.711 --> 01:45:09.493]  Nothing more.
[01:45:09.493 --> 01:45:12.176]  And that's what American corporation is all about.
[01:45:12.176 --> 01:45:15.940]  Why would these people attack us if we weren't over there occupying them?
[01:45:17.819 --> 01:45:18.760]  Well said.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:29.547]  Speaking of the Republican candidates, of course CBS News got caught giving Ron Paul, the televised portion, 89 seconds of giving Romney more than 10.
[01:45:29.547 --> 01:45:36.632]  And then they got a memo where Bachman was only supposed to get two minutes, Paul 90 seconds, Paul was given 89 seconds.
[01:45:36.632 --> 01:45:40.955]  Now when he wins polls, they just remove him from the winner place.
[01:45:40.955 --> 01:45:42.596]  I mean, that shows how scared they are.
[01:45:42.596 --> 01:45:44.177]  Oh, they're scared to death.
[01:45:44.177 --> 01:45:45.638]  Ron Paul's got them on the run.
[01:45:46.638 --> 01:45:54.943]  Hopefully Ron Paul will do something after they won't give him the Republican nomination, because rest assured, he's not going to get it.
[01:45:54.943 --> 01:46:01.686]  And hopefully he'll be courageous enough and take the bold step to become the Libertarian and be our candidate.
[01:46:01.686 --> 01:46:03.868]  But we'll have to wait and see on that.
[01:46:03.868 --> 01:46:07.790]  But the rest of these, I'll tell you, they're disillusional.
[01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:11.632]  How can you take someone serious who gets up there and tells you God told him to run?
[01:46:14.913 --> 01:46:19.037]  Well, that's done cynically to get the evangelical vote.
[01:46:19.037 --> 01:46:23.282]  So that means I guess he's going to be there and God's going to be telling them what to do.
[01:46:23.282 --> 01:46:31.170]  It's kind of like when George Bush was questioned on the invasion of Iraq and they asked him, well, did you consult your father?
[01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:35.675]  And Bush turned around proudly and said, no, I consulted a higher father.
[01:46:36.616 --> 01:46:38.977]  And I almost fell out of the chair.
[01:46:38.977 --> 01:46:45.959]  I said, you mean this SOB wants me to believe he talked to God and God told him to invade Iraq?
[01:46:45.959 --> 01:46:50.000]  Well, that's like the head of Goldman Sachs says he's doing God's work.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:57.762]  Well, any of these evangelical people out there, if you buy into that, you're a bunch of idiots.
[01:46:57.762 --> 01:47:03.764]  If you really and truly believe that these high elected officials have been told by God,
[01:47:04.901 --> 01:47:10.490]  Well, that was Hitler's favorite passage, just do whatever the government says.
[01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:13.414]  You know, throw people in ovens and order to it's of the Lord.
[01:47:13.414 --> 01:47:15.798]  It's very sick.
[01:47:15.798 --> 01:47:19.103]  The JFK anniversary is coming up.
[01:47:19.103 --> 01:47:20.265]  I know you're speaking at a prestigious
[01:47:20.265 --> 01:47:20.725]  We're good to go.
[01:47:49.633 --> 01:48:00.616]  But it's not, Alex, because mainstream media, who have bamboozled us for 50 years, still will not say a word about it, nor will they admit that they were wrong.
[01:48:00.616 --> 01:48:08.458]  That Lee Harvey Oswald did not kill John Kennedy, and if he was involved, he certainly was not alone.
[01:48:08.458 --> 01:48:16.460]  And yet, mainstream media ignores everything you say and continue to do it, and they will never admit it.
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:18.221]  Alex, you could have a film
[01:48:19.258 --> 01:48:22.865]  Of somebody shooting from behind the picket fence.
[01:48:22.865 --> 01:48:26.271]  And they still would not accept it.
[01:48:26.271 --> 01:48:28.635]  You know, you could have one of the shooters come forward.
[01:48:29.355 --> 01:48:33.819]  Well, there's always a bridge to fall of humorous, but I agree with you.
[01:48:33.819 --> 01:48:35.781]  They certainly think they're invincible.
[01:48:55.839 --> 01:48:57.060]  Well, isn't that interesting too?
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:57.340]  And I'm glad.
[01:49:11.526 --> 01:49:12.927]  Isn't he a Democrat?
[01:49:12.927 --> 01:49:13.568]  Yes.
[01:49:13.568 --> 01:49:18.672]  Yeah, see, so it ain't just the Republicans, it's the Democrats also.
[01:49:18.672 --> 01:49:21.034]  And people better wake up to that.
[01:49:21.034 --> 01:49:28.881]  I've been harping on it now for 20 to 25 years, that these two political parties are not the solution, they're the problem.
[01:49:29.521 --> 01:49:32.842]  John Adams warned us way back when they formed the country.
[01:49:32.842 --> 01:49:41.845]  He said the fall of the United States would not come from a force outside, it would come from within, and it would be when political parties take over the government.
[01:49:41.845 --> 01:49:48.028]  He said party factionalization, where we have a two-party dictatorship.
[01:49:48.028 --> 01:49:48.648]  Exactly.
[01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:51.109]  It's just like pro-wrestling, Alex.
[01:49:51.989 --> 01:49:56.697]  People wake up in front of the cameras they don't like each other.
[01:49:56.697 --> 01:50:01.165]  Behind the scenes they're working together and earning money.
[01:50:01.165 --> 01:50:03.288]  That's exactly what pro wrestling is.
[01:50:05.032 --> 01:50:11.175]  And now if you'll believe that for pro wrestling, why won't you believe it for the politicians?
[01:50:11.175 --> 01:50:16.938]  Well, Gov, I'm just glad that you're on this TSA thing because you're bringing a lot of light to it and things are coming to a head.
[01:50:16.938 --> 01:50:19.279]  We had the big opt-out last year on Thanksgiving.
[01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:20.640]  We didn't launch that this year.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:22.181]  We need to get groups pushing.
[01:50:24.761 --> 01:50:30.927]  Final questions and comments for Jesse Ventura.
[01:50:30.927 --> 01:50:36.552]  And of course, we sell his book, 63 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read, at Infowars.com.
[01:50:36.552 --> 01:50:38.835]  We'll also give you his website, if I don't forget.
[01:50:38.835 --> 01:50:41.017]  On the other side, so get your pens and paper ready.
[01:50:41.017 --> 01:50:43.799]  And then Max Keiser's coming up in your phone calls with Aaron Dyke.
[01:50:43.799 --> 01:50:44.200]  Stay with us.
[01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:54.711]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?

[01:51:02.894 --> 01:51:06.515]  A Big Berkey Water Filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals,
[01:51:06.795 --> 01:51:10.558]  Chlorine, fluoride, pesticides and herbicides, VOCs and more.
[01:51:10.558 --> 01:51:16.124]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.

[01:53:43.626 --> 01:53:48.489]  Affinity Health Products, the finest and most innovative natural health products available.
[01:54:00.503 --> 01:54:02.025]  We're good to go.
[01:54:18.426 --> 01:54:24.168]  You know, Ike is a very charismatic guy, I believe what he's saying, and I appreciate his work as well.
[01:54:24.168 --> 01:54:31.910]  It's sad to see what happened, but you never talk about the TV show until it's out, but obviously this information is now out.
[01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:36.011]  So I want to ask you, you went to interview Ike in, what, Pennsylvania?
[01:54:36.011 --> 01:54:36.831]  Cleveland.
[01:54:36.831 --> 01:54:38.012]  Oh, Cleveland, Ohio.
[01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:41.755]  And what happened there between you and David Icke?
[01:54:41.755 --> 01:54:47.540]  Well, he just, I don't know, he got all offended and told me to F off and walked off the interview simply.
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:53.266]  I was asking him questions about his expertise and that's reptilians.
[01:54:53.266 --> 01:54:58.371]  And, you know, I go from a point of, you know, there is no dumb question.
[01:54:58.371 --> 01:55:01.153]  If I don't understand it, it's certainly not dumb to me.
[01:55:01.153 --> 01:55:02.355]  I was trained that way by
[01:55:03.175 --> 01:55:08.560]  I just found him to be one of the worst interviews I've ever possibly done because he's not forthcoming at all.
[01:55:30.925 --> 01:55:48.635]  Well, he had been sick and I almost wish you guys via Skype could do it again and try it one more time because two years ago you guys had a positive interview with him and he's really great on so many issues.
[01:55:49.475 --> 01:55:55.801]  Absolutely.
[01:55:55.801 --> 01:56:05.849]  Everything I did on that episode pointed to going to him to get answers, but getting answers from him is impossible.
[01:56:05.849 --> 01:56:15.257]  I told him, I said, oh no, they want to do an open-minded thing, and you're basically the star of this episode, this interview, but it is reality, so sometimes things get crazy.
[01:56:15.257 --> 01:56:16.738]  There's so few of us that are
[01:56:19.053 --> 01:56:19.593]  I don't know.
[01:56:43.965 --> 01:56:47.169]  You know, we ought to get you and Ike on this radio show for a debate.
[01:56:47.169 --> 01:56:50.773]  That'd be interesting.
[01:56:50.773 --> 01:56:52.595]  I don't think I'd care to.
[01:56:52.595 --> 01:56:58.562]  I don't think it would go anywhere, Alex, because he obviously took great offense to me, and I don't know why.
[01:56:58.562 --> 01:57:02.427]  All I did was ask him questions that were pertinent.
[01:57:03.147 --> 01:57:08.872]  I think he misunderstood reading his article because he said he sat there for an hour and then he wanted to meet you and they didn't bring him in.
[01:57:33.328 --> 01:57:34.109]  We're good to go.
[01:57:49.444 --> 01:57:53.526]  Well, I don't know anything about that, you know, and I'm not going to worry about it.
[01:57:53.526 --> 01:57:56.007]  You know, I was there to interview him.
[01:57:56.007 --> 01:57:59.688]  He clearly didn't want to talk to me about anything.
[01:57:59.688 --> 01:58:01.789]  And when he did, he wouldn't answer any questions.
[01:58:01.789 --> 01:58:02.610]  He attacked me.
[01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:04.090]  Alright, well God bless you.
[01:58:04.090 --> 01:58:05.991]  I want you to have a great time down in Mexico.
[01:58:05.991 --> 01:58:06.471]  Be safe.
[01:58:06.471 --> 01:58:09.713]  And I know you're talking to the Libertarians off record.
[01:58:09.713 --> 01:58:10.593]  You might run, huh?
[01:58:11.133 --> 01:58:13.035]  No, I wouldn't hold my breath on it.
[01:58:13.035 --> 01:58:17.679]  I've just spoken to them and they've spoken to me and the lines of dialogue are open.
[01:58:17.679 --> 01:58:19.360]  It's not anything farther than that.
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:27.707]  They'll have their convention in early May and at that convention they will decide who's going to be their candidate for the 2012 election.
[01:58:27.707 --> 01:58:29.108]  Jesse, thank you so much.
[01:58:29.108 --> 01:58:31.150]  Okay, Alan.
[01:58:31.150 --> 01:58:34.653]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:34.653 --> 01:58:36.714]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:48.747]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:48.747 --> 01:58:51.309]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:58:51.309 --> 01:58:56.673]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:58:56.673 --> 01:58:59.735]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:58:59.735 --> 01:59:01.797]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:02.037 --> 01:59:08.281]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:08.281 --> 01:59:11.663]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:11.663 --> 01:59:17.446]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:17.446 --> 01:59:19.087]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:19.087 --> 01:59:20.387]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:20.387 --> 01:59:22.909]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:23.069 --> 01:59:27.273]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:27.273 --> 01:59:31.898]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:34.501]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:59:45.049 --> 01:59:49.872]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:59:49.872 --> 01:59:51.473]  You want answers?
[01:59:51.473 --> 01:59:53.014]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:53.014 --> 01:59:57.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:57.216 --> 02:00:01.258]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:02.459 --> 02:00:10.981]  Okay, my friends, Greg Palast is coming up to break down the incredible developments with MF Global.
[02:00:10.981 --> 02:00:22.383]  I mean, do people realize how big this is that a company could just say we're keeping 1.2 million or more of people's private, segregated accounts, and that the media hasn't really made a big deal about it?
[02:00:22.383 --> 02:00:24.384]  I mean, it's finally starting to get attention, but...
[02:00:25.749 --> 02:00:36.636]  If you look at how many people in the Republican and Democratic parties, but particularly the Democratic parties, are just out-and-out, villainous, street-thug-type criminals.
[02:00:36.636 --> 02:00:42.280]  A lot of Republican leaders, they do it through big, giant, global contracts, Halliburton, stuff like that.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.802]  It's just as corrupt, or more so.
[02:00:44.802 --> 02:00:48.805]  But with the Democrats, it's a gutter-type thing, like with Bill Clinton.
[02:00:49.645 --> 02:00:52.266]  You know, beating out a mean Arkansas, flying the cocaine in.
[02:00:52.266 --> 02:00:56.146]  I know he was there with his limo, taking delivery.
[02:00:56.146 --> 02:00:59.827]  And, you know, overseeing who would be murdered, and personally raping the women.
[02:00:59.827 --> 02:01:01.908]  Here's another headline.
[02:01:01.908 --> 02:01:09.449]  Political fixer and Obama pal, Tony Resco, gets 10 years in jail.
[02:01:09.449 --> 02:01:11.250]  Isn't that precious?
[02:01:11.250 --> 02:01:13.890]  Again, Obama pardons dope dealers.
[02:01:13.890 --> 02:01:16.011]  Chicago jewel thief pardoned.
[02:01:18.121 --> 02:01:30.388]  Uh, Nancy Pelosi's using Occupy Wall Street to raise cash when she's totally controlled by the corrupt elements of Wall Street that are using big government control and selective enforcement to shut down their competition.
[02:01:30.388 --> 02:01:34.630]  See, it's not either you're for free market, let banks run over you, and let them get banker bailouts.
[02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:39.312]  Well, I guess it's very free market that you have banker bailouts, can mainline conservatives say.
[02:01:39.312 --> 02:01:44.655]  It's mega-banks waging war against the real economy.
[02:01:45.856 --> 02:01:46.617]  Here's another one.
[02:01:46.617 --> 02:01:49.359]  Where's the cash corzine?
[02:01:49.359 --> 02:01:54.484]  Again, the New York Times saying, where is the $1.2 billion plus?
[02:01:54.484 --> 02:02:01.771]  And while MF Global shortfall doubles to over $1.2 billion, anger raises as client C funds frozen.
[02:02:01.771 --> 02:02:03.492]  Farm belt rage.
[02:02:04.642 --> 02:02:07.223]  That's right, Farm Belt Rage!
[02:02:07.223 --> 02:02:17.527]  Well, don't worry that the Farm Belt's just going to be imploded and taken over and bankrupted, because they've now got the Rural Affairs Council under the Department of Defense and onto Homeland, alright?
[02:02:17.527 --> 02:02:19.207]  Security, land security.
[02:02:19.207 --> 02:02:23.149]  I mean, that is going to keep everybody just incredibly safe.
[02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:27.990]  Everything's going to be wonderful, and so what if they don't pay people back and it destroys confidence?
[02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:30.711]  When the markets implode even more, the bankers will just take that over.
[02:02:30.711 --> 02:02:32.072]  It's all part of the fun.
[02:02:33.516 --> 02:02:36.558]  Command destruction, or creative destruction as they call it.
[02:02:36.558 --> 02:02:38.399]  Does it look creative to you?
[02:02:38.399 --> 02:02:41.602]  The economy falling apart and sinking into a depression?
[02:02:41.602 --> 02:02:53.950]  To them, farm belt rage over MF Global could chill markets when the CME Group pledged $300 million of its own money to help former MF Global customers get their cash back faster.
[02:02:53.950 --> 02:03:01.696]  The exchange was likely thinking of customers like Kansas cattle rancher Tim Ritzke.
[02:03:02.634 --> 02:03:03.234]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:03:03.234 --> 02:03:07.196]  The CME Group has already kicked in $300 million.
[02:03:07.196 --> 02:03:09.898]  Oh, but it's above $1.2 billion, I'm afraid.
[02:03:09.898 --> 02:03:24.865]  And the CME Group, we've reissued their press releases from a year ago, promising that they had all these hundreds of trillions in assets and everything was guaranteed while attacking Gerald Celente and his comments on the show.
[02:03:26.508 --> 02:03:36.276]  Fed up and frustrated with his broker's collapse and what he sees as the CME's slow efforts to help him retrieve his $30,000 in stranded capital.
[02:03:36.276 --> 02:03:42.080]  The farmer says his faith in the futures industry has been shaken to its core.
[02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:43.841]  Oh!
[02:03:43.841 --> 02:03:48.785]  I would be edging some feeder cattle right now.
[02:03:48.785 --> 02:03:50.807]  But I'm not going to do it.
[02:03:50.807 --> 02:03:54.590]  I'm leaving them exposed to the cash market and I don't like that.
[02:03:54.590 --> 02:03:55.871]  You know, that'll drop down prices.
[02:03:56.656 --> 02:04:10.352]  He went on to say, Reitsky may reside far from the trading pit in Chicago, but he and thousands of other ranchers and farmers across the country are at the heart of our futures trading.
[02:04:10.352 --> 02:04:15.617]  With billions of dollars locked up in MF Global's October 31st bankruptcy filing,
[02:04:17.327 --> 02:04:24.390]  They are likely a key voice in determining if and when the futures business remains its poise and reputation.
[02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:25.410]  It's poise.
[02:04:25.410 --> 02:04:27.151]  We'll be right back with Greg Palast on this.
[02:04:27.151 --> 02:04:30.992]  This affects everything, even if you're not involved in the futures market.
[02:04:30.992 --> 02:04:32.333]  Even if you don't care.
[02:04:32.333 --> 02:04:32.993]  We'll be back.
[02:04:32.993 --> 02:04:35.714]  InfoWars Nightly News coming up tonight, 7 o'clock.

[02:05:49.538 --> 02:05:51.941]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:51.941 --> 02:05:57.648]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:57.648 --> 02:06:03.876]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:04.296 --> 02:06:10.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:14.462]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:14.462 --> 02:06:18.745]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:18.745 --> 02:06:24.708]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:24.708 --> 02:06:28.250]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:28.250 --> 02:06:30.232]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:30.232 --> 02:06:30.672]  It's here.

[02:07:37.644 --> 02:07:38.525]  Others don't.
[02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:44.184]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:44.184 --> 02:07:47.008]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:55.882 --> 02:08:11.138]  Supposedly Wyoming or Montana or Colorado, those are great beautiful states, but I am here in Utah, southern Utah, about to leave here as soon as the radio broadcast is complete and drive back to Austin.
[02:08:11.138 --> 02:08:11.759]  I'll be back.
[02:08:12.699 --> 02:08:15.920]  Tomorrow, we're going to drive Marathon straight through.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:24.242]  I'll be calling in on my own broadcast tomorrow when the amazing investigative reporter Mike Adams hosts the show.

[02:08:38.806 --> 02:08:43.488]  I want to thank our AM and FM affiliates, Global Shortwave and XM.
[02:08:43.488 --> 02:08:47.069]  You, of course, can subscribe to XM Sirius and listen to us.
[02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:51.470]  We're on different channels on each one, but just go to XM Radio and type in Alex Jones.
[02:08:51.470 --> 02:08:53.231]  You can pull up the channels.
[02:08:53.231 --> 02:08:56.492]  The point is that we're reaching a lot of people.
[02:08:56.492 --> 02:09:00.613]  I also want to thank The Drudge Report for more and more carrying our articles a couple times a week.
[02:09:00.613 --> 02:09:04.975]  They've got one up there today that Paul Watson wrote for InfoWars.com.
[02:09:06.463 --> 02:09:15.849]  Right in the middle of the Drudge Report, the biggest news website in the world, hands down, drives more news traffic than the New York Times and Twitter combined!
[02:09:15.849 --> 02:09:17.590]  And Google!
[02:09:17.590 --> 02:09:18.330]  Gotta love it!
[02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:24.433]  And it's wonderful that Drudge carries a lot of our news and information, so we return the favor right back at him.
[02:09:24.433 --> 02:09:33.759]  If you go over there, and the other great folks that work with him, now we're going to be getting to Powell's in a moment, but again, if you go to InfoWars.com,
[02:09:35.126 --> 02:09:53.506]  You can find the story, but if you go to the middle of Drudge, you can see the article where the dreaded secret police that work for the military dictatorship in Egypt—get rid of the old boss, bring in the new boss, even worse—are now saying they're going to call themselves Homeland Security and rationalizing their activities, pointing at U.S.
[02:09:53.506 --> 02:09:55.628]  police and their brutal crackdowns.
[02:09:56.733 --> 02:10:04.396]  On Occupy Wall Street, that is a diverse group, but even if you disagree with Occupy Wall Street, they have a right to protest and demonstrate.
[02:10:04.396 --> 02:10:23.283]  Now, I'm going to talk to Greg in this segment and the next, but then we're going to take him up to the 51 break where I'm going to take calls, but only on the global derivatives meltdown, only on the brokerage firms, only on Credit Suisse coming out and predicting bank runs and the possible end of the euro.
[02:10:24.773 --> 02:10:27.195]  The destruction of confidence is what we're talking about.
[02:10:27.195 --> 02:10:29.017]  And Greg Palast, I'm so glad we've got him.
[02:10:29.017 --> 02:10:33.280]  His new book just debuted last week.
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:33.981]  It's amazing.
[02:10:33.981 --> 02:10:35.322]  Shooting up the best-selling list.
[02:10:35.322 --> 02:10:38.144]  We're going to be breaking that down as well before he leaves us.
[02:10:38.144 --> 02:10:45.610]  But he was a former top federal white-collar crime investigator, just like William K. Black, who's in my film Fall of the Republic.
[02:10:45.610 --> 02:10:53.216]  And he said a year and a half ago, he said, this is an order of magnitude, that means 10 times bigger, than the biggest SNL scam we've ever seen.
[02:10:53.216 --> 02:10:54.237]  The difference now is,
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.284]  They're not just selling Ponzi schemes, they're stealing money directly out of the accounts.
[02:10:59.284 --> 02:11:09.154]  So he's a BBC, ABC reporter, best-selling author, multi-times over, former federal investigator, and I'm just lauding our guest because he's predicted everything that's come true.
[02:11:09.154 --> 02:11:10.416]  That's the kind of guest we have on here.
[02:11:10.956 --> 02:11:20.189]  I have a whole chapter in my book, Descent to Tyranny, where we, it's a transcript of my interview with him in 2002, looking out into the future with derivatives and breaking down what's now happened.
[02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:25.416]  The model of the global banks imploding third world countries through fraud, buying off their politicians.
[02:11:26.607 --> 02:11:30.049]  Going ahead and killing the gooses that lay golden eggs, so you control it.
[02:11:30.049 --> 02:11:33.892]  If you kill and eat the goose, you know nobody else is going to get the golden eggs.
[02:11:33.892 --> 02:11:36.233]  So, they're going for red meat, not gold eggs.
[02:11:36.233 --> 02:11:37.254]  They don't want a free market.
[02:11:37.254 --> 02:11:38.175]  They don't want true freedom.
[02:11:38.175 --> 02:11:39.496]  They don't want stability.
[02:11:39.496 --> 02:11:41.057]  And here's Reuters, what we told you about.
[02:11:41.057 --> 02:11:44.239]  I'm going to get Greg Powell's take on this.
[02:11:44.239 --> 02:11:53.605]  Farm belt rage over MF Global could chill markets, and it quotes all of these farmers and ranchers that bet on the different commodities.
[02:11:54.417 --> 02:11:55.618]  Because they're experts in it.
[02:11:55.618 --> 02:12:00.700]  And I've got a family that's been involved in cattle futures and corn futures and do pretty good in it.
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:04.142]  They're not involved in it now because they know you can get burned.
[02:12:04.142 --> 02:12:07.103]  Even when you've already taken the money, put it in your account.
[02:12:07.103 --> 02:12:09.305]  It's your money, you even put it in in many cases.
[02:12:09.305 --> 02:12:09.985]  They're taking
[02:12:10.896 --> 02:12:15.019]  These accounts, and here's the key word, that are segregated.
[02:12:15.019 --> 02:12:23.066]  Now, just a week and a half ago, the head of the CFTC, who we now learn was involved in MF Global, has had to recuse himself with Corzine.
[02:12:23.066 --> 02:12:26.969]  He came out and said, this looks, you know, criminal, blah, blah, blah.
[02:12:26.969 --> 02:12:30.953]  Now, there was a week-long cover-up where they didn't want to discuss it.
[02:12:30.953 --> 02:12:36.958]  Now, the New York Times is covering it today, saying it's over $1.2 billion, up from $600 million.
[02:12:36.958 --> 02:12:38.899]  And the CME Group has had to dump $300 million in.
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:48.588]  This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the spark that lights off the fireworks factory, as they say.
[02:12:48.588 --> 02:12:52.812]  And joining us to break this down, how big this could be.
[02:12:52.812 --> 02:12:55.274]  You think we're in a depression now, folks?
[02:12:55.274 --> 02:12:59.138]  Why would the banksters destroy confidence like this?
[02:12:59.138 --> 02:13:02.181]  Greg Palast, who understands their kleptocracy.
[02:13:03.502 --> 02:13:07.785]  They're kleptocratic psychology because he studied them and put a lot of them in jail.
[02:13:07.785 --> 02:13:09.566]  He joins us.
[02:13:09.566 --> 02:13:15.110]  Greg, is this the beginning of a wild orgy of corruption or have we seen the worst?
[02:13:16.957 --> 02:13:21.200]  No, this is the beginning of the exposure of some of the wild orgy of corruption.
[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:22.541]  It's there.
[02:13:22.541 --> 02:13:32.268]  Okay, let's remember, when you're talking about MF Capital and you're talking about John Corzine, this was the guy who was CEO of Goldman Sachs.
[02:13:32.268 --> 02:13:38.393]  So, in other words, this is the guy that lit the fuse and began the fires that, of course, blew up his company.
[02:13:38.393 --> 02:13:39.273]  Not that he cares.
[02:13:39.273 --> 02:13:41.655]  He was already worth about a quarter billion dollars.
[02:13:41.655 --> 02:13:42.676]  So, if you're
[02:13:42.856 --> 02:13:47.941]  If you're out there, don't wring out your hanky for John Corzine.
[02:13:47.941 --> 02:13:53.167]  You know, just a billion bucks is disappearing, a lot of it farmer's money because it's commodities.
[02:13:55.204 --> 02:13:55.784]  And you're right.
[02:13:55.784 --> 02:14:01.267]  And so what I did in Vulture's Picnic, and by the way, just so you know, Alex, one, I want to thank you.
[02:14:01.267 --> 02:14:13.152]  I know they think that the listeners out there in the middle of America are illiterate, but actually, you put Vulture's Picnic on the Times Best Seller list, Alex, so thank you much.
[02:14:13.152 --> 02:14:16.574]  But I have to change the name from Vulture's Picnic to Job Creator's Picnic.
[02:14:16.574 --> 02:14:18.855]  You know, people like John Corzine, right?
[02:14:18.855 --> 02:14:21.436]  But here's one of the things I uncovered there.
[02:14:22.057 --> 02:14:41.814]  These guys, Goldman and the big banks, were running this scam where they're working with the Euro countries, especially Greece, secretly working with the governments and the central bankers to pull money out of the central banks, to convert the currencies into yens, dollars, move them around, where they were Euros at first,
[02:14:42.515 --> 02:14:49.717]  Put them back in and supposedly these big operators like Goldman were taking billions and billions and billions of dollars of losses.
[02:14:49.717 --> 02:14:52.118]  Well, that's on the cover on the surface.
[02:14:52.118 --> 02:14:56.560]  And of course, the TARP program, you are now paying for all their losses.
[02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:02.042]  Goldman Sachs was turned into a commercial bank with public guarantees in 24 hours.
[02:15:02.042 --> 02:15:02.742]  This usually takes
[02:15:03.382 --> 02:15:06.563]  Ten years, and you have to show a strong balance sheet.
[02:15:06.563 --> 02:15:08.524]  Goldman Sachs says, we're bankrupt.
[02:15:08.524 --> 02:15:10.504]  Make us a commercial bank and bail us out.
[02:15:10.504 --> 02:15:12.205]  They do that in 24 hours.
[02:15:12.205 --> 02:15:14.346]  So they're showing losses, but they weren't there.
[02:15:14.346 --> 02:15:15.946]  Those losses weren't there.
[02:15:15.946 --> 02:15:18.767]  They had secret agreements with the Greek government.
[02:15:18.767 --> 02:15:27.730]  They had secret agreements with Italian and Spanish governments, in which Goldman and the other banks' losses, but particularly Goldman, would be made up
[02:15:28.863 --> 02:15:37.791]  Goldman would be basically paid off secretly, and in addition, Goldman got about $340 million in fees.
[02:15:37.791 --> 02:15:42.214]  That's about a third of a billion dollars in fees for this scam.
[02:15:42.214 --> 02:15:51.402]  The purpose was, by the way, so that these governments could say that their deficits were less than 3%, which is what they need to be in the Eurozone.
[02:15:51.402 --> 02:15:56.306]  But of course, being in the Eurozone is like, you know, wanting to be in the leper colony.
[02:15:56.306 --> 02:15:57.067]  But nevertheless,
[02:15:57.794 --> 02:16:07.260]  So you have to understand that what's happening in the world financial markets, it would be wrong to think of this as a financial disaster first.
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:13.725]  It is a crime scene and like many crime scenes where there's bleeding bodies, where there's blown up buildings, where there's arson.
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:16.021]  And this is financial arson.
[02:16:16.021 --> 02:16:26.246]  Yeah, there's destruction, but it's very, to use the foggy term, financial downturn, big recession, is missing the point.
[02:16:26.246 --> 02:16:32.030]  What we have now is a world, is a finance community, which is a crime scene.
[02:16:32.030 --> 02:16:39.133]  Because, you know, when I was a fraud investigator, I mean, what's strange to me, I don't know what, you know, I mean, I've seen the bottom.
[02:16:39.133 --> 02:16:41.014]  I've seen some pretty bad stuff, Alex.
[02:16:41.014 --> 02:16:42.955]  After all, I did racketeering investigations.
[02:16:44.767 --> 02:16:46.511]  This is the type of stuff we used to cuff people for.
[02:16:46.511 --> 02:16:50.820]  I mean, guys like Corzine, guys like Blank Fine from, uh, uh, Goldman.
[02:16:51.562 --> 02:16:58.448]  When they got caught in the scam, we used to cuff these guys and read them their rights and walk them out of the buildings like Ivan Boesky.
[02:16:58.448 --> 02:17:03.311]  I mean, Boesky was a Girl Scout compared to these guys, and he didn't take down entire nations.
[02:17:03.311 --> 02:17:04.392]  Well, that's the question.
[02:17:04.392 --> 02:17:14.640]  Why did Bernie Madoff go to jail for only 50, 75 billion or so, some say 100 billion, when these guys are involved in destroying and tying up trillions?
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:16.402]  I mean, was he kind of an outside player?
[02:17:16.402 --> 02:17:18.964]  I mean, he was the guy that, you know, came up with the NASDAQ.
[02:17:21.365 --> 02:17:27.729]  Well, let's not forget that Madoff was covering for others like Paulson, okay?
[02:17:27.729 --> 02:17:39.137]  And he had guys, there were investors in Madoff's funds who were earning two and three hundred percent when everyone else was getting hosed, because obviously a few billionaires knew.
[02:17:39.137 --> 02:17:41.959]  So either he took the fall for them,
[02:17:43.241 --> 02:17:46.963]  Or, basically, the 1% of the 1% was going down.
[02:17:46.963 --> 02:17:48.164]  He was their toy boy.
[02:17:48.164 --> 02:17:50.325]  He was just a tool.
[02:17:50.325 --> 02:17:52.587]  Someone got that money, and take a look.
[02:17:52.587 --> 02:17:53.567]  It wasn't made off.
[02:17:53.567 --> 02:17:55.288]  That money went somewhere.
[02:17:55.288 --> 02:17:57.410]  It didn't just vanish into outer space.
[02:17:57.410 --> 02:17:58.770]  You know, they say they lost some money.
[02:17:58.770 --> 02:18:00.051]  The money wasn't lost.
[02:18:00.051 --> 02:18:01.412]  Believe me, someone found it.
[02:18:01.412 --> 02:18:03.453]  It went somewhere.
[02:18:03.453 --> 02:18:07.836]  And the guys who got the money are giggling.
[02:18:07.836 --> 02:18:08.356]  Are giggling.
[02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:16.055]  Okay, and there's at least four arbitrageurs that you can name who got the money from that scam.
[02:18:16.055 --> 02:18:17.436]  Why aren't they giving it up?
[02:18:17.436 --> 02:18:25.482]  Only one woman... I mean, how much confidence is this going to destroy?
[02:18:25.482 --> 02:18:31.447]  They look at confidence destruction because it creates more of what's called volatility in the markets, which increases the value of derivatives.
[02:18:31.447 --> 02:18:34.069]  So, volatility, destruction is part of the game.
[02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:35.266]  That's
[02:18:48.214 --> 02:18:49.535]  Fire insurance.
[02:18:49.535 --> 02:18:52.416]  But it's like arsonists selling fire insurance.
[02:18:52.416 --> 02:18:55.117]  The banks that are selling it like Goldman's.
[02:18:55.117 --> 02:18:56.497]  So they keep setting fires.
[02:18:56.497 --> 02:18:59.278]  They keep saying, oh, you need fire insurance.
[02:18:59.278 --> 02:19:00.899]  You know how much they're making?
[02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:04.420]  You know that the average Greek family, for example, and that's where it's worse.
[02:19:04.420 --> 02:19:05.441]  But you're getting it, too.
[02:19:05.441 --> 02:19:07.721]  You know, it's coming to L.A., so don't worry.
[02:19:07.721 --> 02:19:09.162]  Just hang on there.
[02:19:09.162 --> 02:19:10.582]  You think you're that far from Athens?
[02:19:10.582 --> 02:19:11.043]  You aren't.
[02:19:11.043 --> 02:19:13.143]  Not financially.
[02:19:13.143 --> 02:19:14.344]  In Athens right now.

[02:24:09.213 --> 02:24:10.134]  We are back live.
[02:24:10.134 --> 02:24:11.174]  Greg Palance is our guest.
[02:24:11.174 --> 02:24:12.314]  I'll be with you throughout the rest of the hour.
[02:24:12.314 --> 02:24:14.935]  I want to open the phones up in the next segment.
[02:24:14.935 --> 02:24:16.636]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[02:24:16.636 --> 02:24:16.696]  800-259-9231.
[02:24:16.696 --> 02:24:19.496]  On financial questions for Fraud Investigator, best-selling author,
[02:24:28.019 --> 02:24:32.041]  Greg Pallas, former federal white-collar racketeering investigator.
[02:24:32.041 --> 02:24:33.061]  Greg Pallas.
[02:24:33.061 --> 02:24:36.843]  Greg, going into break, I ask the question, how far will it go?
[02:24:36.843 --> 02:24:39.584]  I understand the command destruction, the volatility.
[02:24:39.584 --> 02:24:43.086]  The insiders like volatility because it's like a rigged casino.
[02:24:43.086 --> 02:24:45.507]  They know what's going to happen.
[02:24:45.507 --> 02:24:50.729]  But at a certain point, we're now getting past, you know, mega-minions, mega-gophers like Madoff.
[02:24:51.736 --> 02:25:00.942]  Up to super minions like Corzine, who then works for the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Dutch Royalty, the British Royalty, the Saudi Royalty, folks like that.
[02:25:00.942 --> 02:25:04.824]  Now we're getting up to the... I mean, are they just going to take everybody's money?
[02:25:04.824 --> 02:25:06.044]  And that's just the way it is?
[02:25:06.044 --> 02:25:08.366]  And I guess Homeland Security's standing by?
[02:25:11.044 --> 02:25:28.825]  Well, I thought that there was kind of a bottom to what these guys would do, but I just, you know, and let me be commercial and remind you that my new book is Vulture's Picnic, and if you go to vulturespicnic.org, you can get some of this info, including, by the way, the secret memo between Tim Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury, and
[02:25:30.486 --> 02:25:36.329]  Larry Summers, our economics star, who should be called the typhoid Mary of economics.
[02:25:36.329 --> 02:25:41.752]  I want you to go and see that at vulturespicnic.org and you'll see what's going on.
[02:25:41.752 --> 02:25:43.213]  These guys really have no bottom.
[02:25:43.213 --> 02:25:45.054]  When you look at that, that was a memo.
[02:25:45.054 --> 02:25:55.800]  And by the way, I got that memo verified by the head, the Director General of the World Trade Organization himself, because my position with BBC, I can get to anyone in the world, basically.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:25:57.081]  And they verified this stuff.
[02:25:57.953 --> 02:25:58.354]  This is
[02:26:08.988 --> 02:26:12.010]  Geithner tells Summers, call Corzine.
[02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:14.692]  This is the guy that just took us down for a billion bucks.
[02:26:14.692 --> 02:26:17.494]  And believe me, he ain't gonna be wearing pinstripes.
[02:26:17.494 --> 02:26:18.534]  It ain't happening.
[02:26:18.534 --> 02:26:22.897]  So I thought that there was a bot until I've seen the latest documents, the latest material.
[02:26:22.897 --> 02:26:24.578]  These guys are going for broke.
[02:26:24.578 --> 02:26:26.519]  We go broke and they clean up.
[02:26:26.519 --> 02:26:29.181]  They set the fire in Greece and now they're buying up
[02:26:29.561 --> 02:26:35.506]  The Greek water systems, the Greek ports like Thessalonica, you know, like these are famous old names.
[02:26:35.506 --> 02:26:38.568]  You saw the film 300 or something, you know.
[02:26:38.568 --> 02:26:41.110]  Ancient stuff that they're buying at the beaches, right?
[02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:44.072]  So now they're moving on to Italy, they're moving on to Portugal, Spain.
[02:26:45.667 --> 02:26:50.750]  They're doing this thing all over the world and, of course, picking up oil properties absolutely everywhere.
[02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:53.292]  You set the world on fire.
[02:26:53.292 --> 02:26:56.174]  You're the last guy standing with the cash.
[02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:59.596]  You clean up and pick up everything at the fire sale.
[02:26:59.596 --> 02:27:07.982]  The number one thing that's happening, these so-called austerity programs that are the result of this massive volatility and explosion in cost of derivatives.
[02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:16.018]  The austerity programs begin with privatization, selling off of public properties.
[02:27:16.018 --> 02:27:19.062]  Man, these guys should clean it up.
[02:27:19.062 --> 02:27:21.265]  They're going to be the landlords of the planet.
[02:27:21.265 --> 02:27:22.407]  They'll have everything.
[02:27:22.407 --> 02:27:23.828]  We're just going to be living on their planet.
[02:27:23.828 --> 02:27:24.129]  That's it.
[02:27:25.709 --> 02:27:29.311]  And you can see they're setting up this total police state surveillance grid.
[02:27:29.311 --> 02:27:30.771]  It's standardized worldwide.
[02:27:30.771 --> 02:27:34.553]  And now, Greg, I guess they can't call people like myself a kook.
[02:27:34.553 --> 02:27:40.516]  They admit in Time Magazine, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times of London, London Independent, London Telegraph.
[02:27:41.156 --> 02:27:53.284]  Oh, it's a banking dictatorship by Goldman Sachs who goes in and takes over governments and takes decades to do it and makes money on the way up with derivatives and makes money on the way down and thank God they're there running everything.
[02:27:53.284 --> 02:27:55.726]  It's a global corporate government!
[02:27:55.726 --> 02:27:57.187]  I mean, wow!
[02:27:57.187 --> 02:28:01.850]  And I guess they just think it'll just go on forever, Greg.
[02:28:01.850 --> 02:28:02.730]  Yeah.
[02:28:02.730 --> 02:28:08.554]  I think one of the things that we have to recognize is that, um... Can you hear me?
[02:28:08.554 --> 02:28:08.814]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:10.965 --> 02:28:12.967]  Okay, sorry, I was losing out there.
[02:28:12.967 --> 02:28:13.828]  Hey, that's alright.
[02:28:13.828 --> 02:28:14.508]  What was happening?
[02:28:14.508 --> 02:28:15.229]  Sounds great, my friend.
[02:28:15.229 --> 02:28:17.431]  Go ahead.
[02:28:17.431 --> 02:28:19.032]  Okay, alright, yeah, I came back in to you.
[02:28:19.032 --> 02:28:21.014]  Wait, is this?
[02:28:21.014 --> 02:28:22.515]  Can you, I'm sorry, can you hear me now?
[02:28:22.515 --> 02:28:23.256]  I just want to make sure.
[02:28:23.256 --> 02:28:24.457]  Yes, go ahead, Greg.
[02:28:24.457 --> 02:28:26.319]  I lose you, Alex.
[02:28:26.319 --> 02:28:34.566]  Alright, what's happened is that the, that in the cradle of democracy, Greece,
[02:28:35.296 --> 02:28:41.878]  When the President of Greece said, well, we should let the people vote on the bankers' proposal, the U.S.
[02:28:41.878 --> 02:28:46.199]  and international press went completely hog-nuts wild.
[02:28:46.199 --> 02:28:49.099]  How dare you let people vote on the fate of their economy?
[02:28:49.099 --> 02:28:54.881]  And they got rid of the elected president, and they put in a guy who was a Goldman Sachs advisor, completely unelected.
[02:28:54.881 --> 02:28:56.181]  Same thing happened in Italy.
[02:28:56.181 --> 02:28:59.882]  I wasn't a fan of Berlusconi, but at least he was an elected president.
[02:28:59.882 --> 02:29:01.142]  Now you have... Can you imagine?
[02:29:01.142 --> 02:29:03.483]  The bankers are literally picking presidents.
[02:29:04.003 --> 02:29:18.308]  It's a financial coup d'etat, and we're being told that this is a good idea because only the unelected have the guts to tell us that we have to cut government and cut what we are owed from our taxes.
[02:29:18.308 --> 02:29:20.068]  It's a new type of authoritarianism.
[02:29:20.068 --> 02:29:21.189]  I want you to finish up with that.
[02:29:21.189 --> 02:29:22.769]  Talk about austerity in Greece.
[02:29:22.769 --> 02:29:24.410]  Then we'll go to calls straight ahead.
[02:29:24.410 --> 02:29:24.910]  Stay with us.
[02:29:24.910 --> 02:29:26.510]  Greg Pallast is our guest.
[02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:27.811]  His new book, Vulture's Picnic.
[02:29:27.811 --> 02:29:28.151]  Stay with us.
[02:29:29.775 --> 02:29:33.704]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:33.704 --> 02:29:36.391]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:40.319 --> 02:29:44.881]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:29:44.881 --> 02:29:45.782]  Number one.
[02:29:45.782 --> 02:29:49.203]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:29:49.203 --> 02:29:50.084]  Number two.
[02:29:50.084 --> 02:29:54.966]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:29:54.966 --> 02:29:55.707]  It's true.
[02:29:55.707 --> 02:30:00.249]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:00.569 --> 02:30:01.390]  Number 3.
[02:30:01.390 --> 02:30:04.993]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:04.993 --> 02:30:08.897]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:08.897 --> 02:30:09.697]  Number 4.
[02:30:09.697 --> 02:30:12.460]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:12.460 --> 02:30:16.143]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:16.143 --> 02:30:16.944]  Number 5.
[02:30:16.944 --> 02:30:21.088]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:21.088 --> 02:30:25.852]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:26.112 --> 02:30:30.296]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:30.296 --> 02:30:32.078]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:32.078 --> 02:30:34.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:36.683]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:30:41.246 --> 02:30:42.948]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:42.948 --> 02:30:48.254]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:48.254 --> 02:30:49.795]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:49.795 --> 02:30:58.585]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:59.305 --> 02:31:06.830]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:31:06.830 --> 02:31:14.854]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:31:14.854 --> 02:31:22.238]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:31:25.020 --> 02:31:28.225]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:31:28.225 --> 02:31:30.549]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:31:30.549 --> 02:31:32.733]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:31:41.098 --> 02:31:45.122]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:45.122 --> 02:31:48.366]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:48.366 --> 02:31:53.171]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:53.171 --> 02:31:59.558]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:59.558 --> 02:32:01.801]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:02.341 --> 02:32:02.601]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:02.601 --> 02:32:02.801]  Bernanke?
[02:32:02.801 --> 02:32:03.162]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:03.162 --> 02:32:03.862]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:03.862 --> 02:32:05.543]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:21.232 --> 02:32:28.520]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:37.710]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:32:48.061 --> 02:32:52.002]  Alex Jones here on the road back in Austin tomorrow.
[02:32:52.002 --> 02:32:53.802]  About to have a marathon drive back.
[02:32:53.802 --> 02:33:05.305]  Greg Pallast, former and federal organized crime racketeering investigator, turned journalist with BBC, ABC News, best-selling author, joins us.
[02:33:05.305 --> 02:33:16.688]  And don't forget right now, they're trying to blame us for the guy that shot up the White House, who's a schizophrenic who thinks he's the Christ, reportedly, because he supposedly watched the Obama deception a year ago at the party.
[02:33:17.328 --> 02:33:19.069]  So we got to restrict that free speech.
[02:33:19.069 --> 02:33:30.493]  Boy, let me tell you, be sure and get that film out to everybody as well, because it doesn't really, it gets into Obama, but it shows how he's just a teleprompter reader for the big mega banks and derivatives kingpins bankrupting the planet.
[02:33:30.493 --> 02:33:41.318]  Now I'm going to go to your calls, Frank, Kyle, Lennon, Craig, Tom, and others here in just a moment, but let me just go back to what Greg's saying and give him about five minutes of the floor to really flesh this out.
[02:33:41.318 --> 02:33:46.540]  Understand, I have heard Bloomberg Radio, I have heard
[02:33:47.479 --> 02:33:49.441]  Uh, you name it.
[02:33:49.441 --> 02:33:55.705]  As CNBC, I say heard because I listen to them on XM on a watch bunch of TV, but I listen to TV on radio.
[02:33:55.705 --> 02:34:00.928]  I have heard them all in the last few months demonize freedom, demonize people being able to vote.
[02:34:00.928 --> 02:34:05.812]  Anywhere in Europe, demonize the Germans who might not want to go along with bankrolling all of this.
[02:34:07.348 --> 02:34:14.289]  I've seen them demonize, and I've heard them with assurance say, don't worry, they'll do the right thing with the European bureaucracy.
[02:34:14.289 --> 02:34:17.290]  It's got expert, you know, bankers in there from Goldman Sachs.
[02:34:17.290 --> 02:34:31.253]  They know what to do, and they sell it like Europe's falling apart because none of them ever work, and they're lazy idiots, and they're all just sitting around drinking coffee all day, or, you know, sopping up olive oil on their, you know, baguettes.
[02:34:31.733 --> 02:34:34.194]  These people, they're not doing anything.
[02:34:34.194 --> 02:34:35.515]  Yeah, look at Europe, folks.
[02:34:35.515 --> 02:34:36.435]  Look at the production.
[02:34:36.435 --> 02:34:37.336]  Look what they built.
[02:34:37.336 --> 02:34:39.637]  That's a lie, okay?
[02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:40.698]  That's a lie.
[02:34:40.698 --> 02:34:43.699]  So continuing, I've done the math, but they've admitted this.
[02:34:43.699 --> 02:34:45.720]  Iceland.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:49.362]  91% of the debt not owed by the people.
[02:34:49.362 --> 02:34:52.123]  They said no for over a year, finally got the documents.
[02:34:52.123 --> 02:34:59.187]  Turned out it was all basically the bank's own debt that they've got their own operatives in government to sign on to.
[02:34:59.187 --> 02:35:00.147]  Same thing in Ireland.
[02:35:00.147 --> 02:35:00.948]  Same thing in Greece.
[02:35:01.688 --> 02:35:19.199]  And it's so over the top that the criminals that engineered the derivative fraud get the governments to sign on to it and then golly it that, oh, this is because you've got, you know, too many weeks off a year and because your social security's too big.
[02:35:19.199 --> 02:35:29.366]  I've always been against big government because then they hold people hostage for the benefits and steal most of it, but then people still back the stealing because they've been made dependent.
[02:35:29.366 --> 02:35:30.747]  That's why I've always been against it.
[02:35:31.067 --> 02:35:38.993]  But the point is, tens of trillions of taxpayer money backing up these derivatives in bailouts, you never hear that discussed.
[02:35:38.993 --> 02:35:45.418]  All you hear about the fake neocons is how this is great free market and anybody that doesn't like the bailouts is a commie.
[02:35:45.418 --> 02:35:51.023]  No, no, the fascistic groups are up there using the public's wealth and fake permits
[02:35:51.263 --> 02:35:53.844]  It's not privatization pushed by fake libertarians.
[02:35:53.844 --> 02:36:05.606]  It's not privatization to hand roads over for nothing to a foreign corporation like Centra so they can slap toll roads on it at five times what it's worth, gang raping you financially.
[02:36:05.606 --> 02:36:14.088]  Greg Palast, explain to them what austerity means in Argentina, in all these formerly wealthy countries, moving over to Europe.
[02:36:14.088 --> 02:36:14.908]  What's coming?
[02:36:14.908 --> 02:36:15.968]  What they're going to do?
[02:36:15.968 --> 02:36:18.069]  Because we've seen this handbook before.
[02:36:18.069 --> 02:36:20.089]  What is austerity before we go to these calls?
[02:36:21.833 --> 02:36:24.534]  Okay, well we saw it in Argentina.
[02:36:24.534 --> 02:36:28.816]  And by the way, I checked the inside documents I got from the IMF and the World Bank, worked with the big banks.
[02:36:28.816 --> 02:36:35.079]  I checked it with Joe Stiglitz, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics and was the chief economist of the World Bank.
[02:36:35.079 --> 02:36:36.920]  He's got to come out of the cold.
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:38.200]  He verified this stuff was real.
[02:36:38.200 --> 02:36:46.864]  They had planned in that there was going to be, that they were going to squeeze down the people, take away, as you say, their benefits and, you know, kick up the price of food.
[02:36:46.864 --> 02:36:48.805]  And we ended up with riots in Argentina.
[02:36:49.429 --> 02:36:52.010]  The riots allowed for a repression.
[02:36:52.010 --> 02:36:52.791]  That's what they want.
[02:36:52.791 --> 02:36:54.832]  They want the riots so the tanks can roll.
[02:36:54.832 --> 02:36:56.293]  It's in the plan.
[02:36:56.293 --> 02:36:59.134]  And when I say that, I don't say that stuff lightly, Alex.
[02:36:59.134 --> 02:37:02.116]  I put this stuff at the top of the BBC nightly news.
[02:37:02.116 --> 02:37:04.217]  They're very, very quiet in the document.
[02:37:05.100 --> 02:37:07.221]  Yeah, they write the riot into the document.
[02:37:07.221 --> 02:37:09.542]  Joe Stiglitz called it the IMF riot.
[02:37:09.542 --> 02:37:11.003]  And he said it was right there.
[02:37:11.003 --> 02:37:15.486]  Because they want that riot, so then they bring in the tanks and then they impose this so-called austerity.
[02:37:15.486 --> 02:37:16.346]  What does austerity mean?
[02:37:16.346 --> 02:37:18.387]  It means they cut all your government benefits.
[02:37:18.387 --> 02:37:20.548]  They take the money out of your pension funds.
[02:37:20.548 --> 02:37:23.210]  This is not about whether you think government pension funds are a good idea.
[02:37:23.210 --> 02:37:24.711]  This is about looting them.
[02:37:24.711 --> 02:37:26.952]  Whether it's good or bad, they get looted.
[02:37:26.952 --> 02:37:28.073]  Let's keep in mind what this is about.
[02:37:28.933 --> 02:37:33.016]  The conservatives are going to say, Greg, just briefly, oh good, cut off the welfare queen.
[02:37:33.016 --> 02:37:37.019]  Folks, they took Gerald Salente's account that was his.
[02:37:37.019 --> 02:37:39.221]  They're going to rob everyone.
[02:37:39.221 --> 02:37:46.986]  And they're going to not send the welfare queen the money, they're going to riot and burn the cities, and then they're going to use that to take everybody's liberty.
[02:37:46.986 --> 02:37:48.047]  This is a blueprint.
[02:37:48.047 --> 02:37:49.228]  Listen to Greg Ballast.
[02:37:50.902 --> 02:37:53.525]  Yeah, so then what they did, they started selling off everything in sight.
[02:37:53.525 --> 02:37:57.670]  They had a state oil company, which is bought by the Spaniards, Repsol.
[02:37:57.670 --> 02:38:09.064]  Now, we did a calculation with some other economists, and if the Argentine government had never been forced to basically give away their massive oil fields and oil company,
[02:38:09.464 --> 02:38:13.808]  They would right now have no debt at all.
[02:38:13.808 --> 02:38:16.091]  But instead they were gun to their head.
[02:38:16.091 --> 02:38:17.572]  They gave up the oil company.
[02:38:17.572 --> 02:38:24.159]  They sold the Buenos Aires water system to Enron.
[02:38:24.159 --> 02:38:25.760]  Enron had a water unit.
[02:38:25.760 --> 02:38:28.783]  And of course the first thing Enron did was jack up water prices 400%.
[02:38:29.964 --> 02:38:31.406]  And then there was no water.
[02:38:31.406 --> 02:38:35.990]  And then, of course, Enron evaporates with the water money, of course.
[02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:37.872]  That's the game that's being played.
[02:38:37.872 --> 02:38:38.573]  They ruined us.
[02:38:38.573 --> 02:38:40.475]  There were doctors.
[02:38:40.475 --> 02:38:43.338]  I was getting calls from Argentina.
[02:38:43.338 --> 02:38:49.184]  I knew some doctors and teachers who were hunting in the alleys in garbage cans looking for food.
[02:38:49.184 --> 02:38:51.486]  Until they said, enough!
[02:38:51.486 --> 02:38:52.647]  And the people stood up.
[02:38:53.308 --> 02:39:02.191]  And democratically elected leader, we saw this in Ecuador where they were ruined and the Indians came out of the hills burning the towns, starving, starving.
[02:39:02.191 --> 02:39:04.532]  And in Ecuador, in Brazil, in Argentina, they said enough.
[02:39:04.532 --> 02:39:15.475]  They elected officials who just told these financial jackals, you may not operate here, stick your so-called debts and get out of here.
[02:39:15.475 --> 02:39:17.756]  And they reversed the privatizations.
[02:39:17.756 --> 02:39:21.297]  They took back their own oil companies, kept the wealth for themselves, and now
[02:39:22.037 --> 02:39:26.501]  Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, these are the economies that are growing at 8% a year.
[02:39:26.501 --> 02:39:30.005]  These economies are booming because they told the jackals to get the hell out.
[02:39:30.005 --> 02:39:40.574]  And I gotta tell you, in Brazil, I got a document from the European community, endorsed by our Secretary of State.
[02:39:41.235 --> 02:39:51.724]  Which is a plan to destroy the Brazilian economy through a trade war because Brazil refuses to accept derivatives trades from JP Morgan.
[02:39:51.724 --> 02:39:54.867]  JP Morgan wants to operate in Brazil.
[02:39:54.867 --> 02:39:58.010]  The Brazilian government said, we don't allow toxic financial assets.
[02:39:58.010 --> 02:40:00.472]  We don't allow gambling with banking money.
[02:40:00.472 --> 02:40:03.094]  And the US and the European community have now said, well, you know what?
[02:40:03.234 --> 02:40:13.944]  If you don't let in these bankers with their toxic assets, if you don't decriminalize your banking system like we've done, we're not going to buy your orange juice, we're not going to buy your ethanol, we're going to just wipe you out.
[02:40:13.944 --> 02:40:16.166]  And I have to say that Brazil stood strong on this.
[02:40:16.166 --> 02:40:20.891]  They said, you know what, go ahead, make our day.
[02:40:20.891 --> 02:40:27.457]  And they have been growing at 8% a year, they are booming, and they just say, you know,
[02:40:28.678 --> 02:40:34.041]  We're not inviting, we're not inviting disease here, including financial diseases.
[02:40:34.041 --> 02:40:37.003]  You know, and that's, but now in Europe, they're not doing that.
[02:40:37.003 --> 02:40:54.734]  They're letting the, if you read Vulture's Picnic, the chapter called The Generalism of Globalization, you can see, in fact, at vulturespicnic.org, you can see a little film called The Generalism of Globalization, where I'm in the room with the head of the WTO, and we're going over these documents, these inside documents, and he is saying, well, yeah, he's trying to explain them away, of course.
[02:40:54.734 --> 02:40:57.176]  There's always an explanation, Alex, there's always an explanation.
[02:40:57.956 --> 02:41:02.158]  Uh, the Frenchman is sitting there going, we are not the evil cabal of bankers.
[02:41:02.158 --> 02:41:09.281]  Well, he's head of Credit Lyonnais, the biggest French bank, you know, so it's not a cabal, but they're just secretly meeting and burning down the world for us.
[02:41:09.281 --> 02:41:11.763]  In Europe, the people are not standing up.
[02:41:11.763 --> 02:41:18.246]  Each of these nations has two political major parties, the Socialist Party, the Christian Democratic Party of each nation.
[02:41:18.246 --> 02:41:20.006]  They're all hand in hand.
[02:41:20.006 --> 02:41:25.069]  You can't put, you know, stick a dime between these two parties, and they are all completely mobbed up.
[02:41:25.569 --> 02:41:32.114]  With the banks like Goldman, you know, both Greek parties conducted this fraud with Goldman Sachs, both of them.
[02:41:32.114 --> 02:41:33.795]  They're both dirty on this.
[02:41:33.795 --> 02:41:43.123]  So when it came up for when there was a panic that the God forbid the Greek people should be allowed to vote in the cradle of democracy, the two parties which are involved in the fraud
[02:41:44.370 --> 02:41:46.331]  No, no, no vote.
[02:41:46.331 --> 02:41:49.452]  We're just going to pick this Goldman consultant to be the president.
[02:41:49.452 --> 02:41:50.833]  The guy doesn't even live in Greece.
[02:41:50.833 --> 02:41:52.213]  He's from the States.
[02:41:52.213 --> 02:41:53.234]  He's an American, you know?
[02:41:53.234 --> 02:41:54.194]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:41:54.194 --> 02:41:57.555]  And I don't care if he's American or Greek or whatever.
[02:41:57.555 --> 02:41:58.316]  He's a banker.
[02:41:59.235 --> 02:42:00.637]  And he's not elected.
[02:42:00.637 --> 02:42:02.700]  And you know, they fear democracy.
[02:42:02.700 --> 02:42:08.749]  But I'm telling you that what happened, if you read Vulture's Picnic, I met with the president of Ecuador about this.
[02:42:08.749 --> 02:42:09.931]  He's an economist, by the way.
[02:42:09.931 --> 02:42:10.992]  He taught at the University of Illinois.
[02:42:10.992 --> 02:42:14.437]  He said, I'm not going to let these jackals rip our country apart.
[02:42:15.058 --> 02:42:15.499]  I don't
[02:42:35.714 --> 02:42:36.754]  That's right there, Greg.
[02:42:36.754 --> 02:42:43.056]  Incredible info, and I want to go to callers, but obviously we're going to have to get you back up in the next week or two, because there's so much to cover.
[02:42:43.056 --> 02:42:50.518]  And I want to get into how we beat these people, perhaps if we take a few calls, and where you see things going, and we don't stand up against them.
[02:42:50.518 --> 02:43:00.360]  But going back to what you just pointed out, to hear so-called media in the United States, especially the financial news, actually
[02:43:01.351 --> 02:43:12.358]  Demonizing anybody who is for the people running their own governments and admitting it's a new government where bankers are appointed over your country.
[02:43:12.358 --> 02:43:14.339]  And then now it's not even an issue.
[02:43:14.339 --> 02:43:19.042]  That shows you what they want to set up here with the super committees and everything else.
[02:43:19.042 --> 02:43:24.145]  It is 100% pure confirmation of just how dangerous this system is, Greg.
[02:43:25.936 --> 02:43:27.438]  Yeah, where's the super committee in the Constitution?
[02:43:27.438 --> 02:43:29.641]  I thought we were supposed to elect our Congress.
[02:43:29.641 --> 02:43:31.424]  I mean, I didn't vote for no super committee.
[02:43:31.424 --> 02:43:31.684]  Did you?
[02:43:31.684 --> 02:43:33.086]  I don't remember them on the ballot.
[02:43:33.086 --> 02:43:36.331]  I mean, what is this new thing that now let's turn over?
[02:43:36.331 --> 02:43:41.277]  We're now going to be turning over our finances to unelected committees,
[02:43:41.738 --> 02:43:46.903]  You know, it's deeply dangerous.
[02:43:46.903 --> 02:43:50.146]  It's deeply dangerous and it's financially destructive.
[02:43:50.146 --> 02:43:56.872]  The nations which chose democracy in Latin America are financially, economically soaring.
[02:43:56.872 --> 02:44:00.616]  The nations which have chose the bankers' dictatorship are dying.
[02:44:01.778 --> 02:44:03.498]  Briefly, Senator Jenkins, I want to go to Carl Zier.
[02:44:03.498 --> 02:44:04.799]  Scott was breaking up a bit.
[02:44:04.799 --> 02:44:07.340]  The issue is, this is in our face.
[02:44:07.340 --> 02:44:13.521]  The Constitution says bills come out of the House, introduced by individual members, and they go through a committee process.
[02:44:13.521 --> 02:44:17.282]  Now they take six House, six Senate, and the President and say, we don't need that.
[02:44:17.282 --> 02:44:19.323]  And now they're going to run the Farm Bill.
[02:44:19.323 --> 02:44:23.524]  And now they've got the Pentagon and Homeland Security running the Rural Affairs.
[02:44:23.524 --> 02:44:27.485]  And now there's suddenly federal police everywhere running the Occupy Attacks.
[02:44:27.985 --> 02:44:32.310]  Let's go to calls, but I want to get your take after that on those subjects.
[02:44:32.310 --> 02:44:34.613]  Greg Powell, investigative journalist, is our guest.
[02:44:34.613 --> 02:44:36.495]  Frank in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:44:37.626 --> 02:44:38.627]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:44:38.627 --> 02:44:40.988]  Just two questions, if I may, please.
[02:44:40.988 --> 02:44:47.253]  First of all, with regards to the markets, I mean, the markets are predicated on a certain amount of stability.
[02:44:47.253 --> 02:45:01.502]  And if we've taken a look at, you know, the artificially low interest rates and quantitative easing as a kind of artificial way to prop up the markets, then wouldn't this be counter to that top 1% that owns 80% of the wealth and assets in the markets?
[02:45:01.502 --> 02:45:05.105]  Wouldn't this not serve basically counterproductive to their interests?
[02:45:05.706 --> 02:45:17.563]  They want to keep the quantitative easing in to prop up the general market so they can control the ups and downs and siphon off money because they're involved in total insider accounting level fraud.
[02:45:17.563 --> 02:45:18.604]  It's total insider.
[02:45:18.604 --> 02:45:20.066]  It's beyond insider.
[02:45:20.066 --> 02:45:21.068]  Greg, do you concur with that?
[02:45:23.021 --> 02:45:27.486]  Well yeah, I mean, take a look at when you talk about the very low interest rates.
[02:45:27.486 --> 02:45:29.909]  That's what they're borrowing at, not what we're borrowing at.
[02:45:29.909 --> 02:45:37.277]  They are borrowing at the Fed window, in some cases at actually negative interest rates, but roughly, normally about a quarter percent interest is what the big banks are paying.
[02:45:37.277 --> 02:45:39.580]  Quarter percent, basically nothing, and then they are...
[02:45:40.641 --> 02:45:42.002]  Lending to us.
[02:45:42.002 --> 02:45:43.342]  Look at your credit card rates.
[02:45:43.342 --> 02:45:45.163]  They're at 29% in some cases.
[02:45:45.163 --> 02:45:47.984]  Look at what they're charging the European Union.
[02:45:47.984 --> 02:45:51.445]  They're charging Italy, like, 9% interest.
[02:45:51.445 --> 02:45:53.786]  And they're getting it at a quarter percent interest.
[02:45:53.786 --> 02:45:55.947]  The spread is insane.
[02:45:55.947 --> 02:46:01.149]  And Greg, look at how they're moving to get rid of our credit rating.
[02:46:01.149 --> 02:46:03.630]  Geithner-Singham never happened, knowing they were planning it.
[02:46:03.630 --> 02:46:07.471]  They're maneuvering us, just like a third world country, into complete receivership.
[02:46:09.940 --> 02:46:19.908]  Well yeah, and what's happening is that we have to, so we are lending them money at a quarter percent and then we're borrowing it back at massive interest rates.
[02:46:19.908 --> 02:46:24.312]  I mean, keep in mind that the banks today are holding a trillion and a half, U.S.
[02:46:24.312 --> 02:46:27.875]  banks are holding more than a trillion and a half dollars in cash assets.
[02:46:27.875 --> 02:46:29.076]  What the heck is going on?
[02:46:29.076 --> 02:46:30.117]  That's our money!
[02:46:30.117 --> 02:46:34.681]  We guarantee their fiat currency that they loan it back to us at interest.
[02:46:34.681 --> 02:46:35.781]  Frank, does that answer your question?
[02:46:35.781 --> 02:46:36.302]  What's your other one?
[02:46:36.909 --> 02:46:37.890]  It does, thank you.
[02:46:37.890 --> 02:46:40.152]  And another question for both you gentlemen, please.
[02:46:40.152 --> 02:46:52.361]  With regards to the Occupy movement, no matter what we may think about that, on its effectiveness or not, Mr. Stellante, you know, alluded to something a few days ago, which I think, you know, may be a way of looking at this.
[02:46:52.361 --> 02:47:05.611]  He was talking about the idea of a boycott, that if we just buy local, or in fact, in many cases, not support the system by either, A, withdrawing our funds from the economic system... Yeah, that's what Catherine Austin Fitts says.
[02:47:06.377 --> 02:47:11.740]  Yeah, just buying staples and then taking the money out of the financial system the way we know it.
[02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:16.624]  I mean, that would cause these so-called elites a lot of infighting, wouldn't you gentlemen agree?
[02:47:16.624 --> 02:47:20.686]  Let me briefly get solution ideas from Greg, and we'll go to Kyle and others quickly.
[02:47:20.686 --> 02:47:26.890]  Quickly, what are solutions, and particularly, how about this true local sustainability?
[02:47:26.890 --> 02:47:30.292]  I mean, it's not even so much a solution, it's a survival tactic.
[02:47:30.292 --> 02:47:31.333]  We're going to have to do this.
[02:47:33.524 --> 02:47:41.107]  Well, I think the first simple step is most of America and places like Texas, California, New York have community credit unions.
[02:47:41.107 --> 02:47:46.830]  These are not-for-profit banks that by law must loan all their money into the community.
[02:47:46.830 --> 02:47:47.570]  Move your money there.
[02:47:47.570 --> 02:47:50.471]  Don't feed the snakes that bite you.
[02:47:50.471 --> 02:47:57.054]  I have my money at the New York Community Credit Union, Lower East Side People's Federal.
[02:47:57.654 --> 02:48:06.580]  They were the ones that, by the way, are Occupy Wall Street's banker, and they're the ones that Goldman Sachs is trying to shut down because they're... So that's the interesting thing.
[02:48:06.580 --> 02:48:16.787]  These guys like Goldman and Capital One is going on a warpath against the community credit unions, which means that they're probably a very good idea, a good place to put your money.
[02:48:16.787 --> 02:48:21.750]  They're safe and they're insured, and they loan into the community.
[02:48:21.750 --> 02:48:23.011]  They do not do their...
[02:48:27.534 --> 02:48:27.934]  Hey, Alex!
[02:48:27.934 --> 02:48:28.214]  Alex, Alex!
[02:48:28.214 --> 02:48:28.875]  I apologize.
[02:48:28.875 --> 02:48:31.276]  So much to inquire for, so much to relay to you.
[02:48:52.197 --> 02:49:03.668]  Uh, in terms of the biggest threat, you know, to our children, outside of them being a walking bet, about the vaccines, you know, that's my biggest question for you, a lot of my family.
[02:49:03.668 --> 02:49:04.708]  I'm gonna have to put you on hold.
[02:49:04.708 --> 02:49:06.470]  We're taking financial questions right now, Kyle.
[02:49:06.470 --> 02:49:08.532]  We'll come back to you in a minute after Greg's gone.
[02:49:08.532 --> 02:49:09.353]  Lennon in Oregon.
[02:49:09.353 --> 02:49:12.796]  Lennon, you're on the air.
[02:49:12.796 --> 02:49:14.477]  Hi, uh, Alex.
[02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:15.798]  Yes, sir.
[02:49:15.798 --> 02:49:16.259]  Yes, hi.
[02:49:17.229 --> 02:49:19.631]  I would like to first thank you, gentlemen.
[02:49:19.631 --> 02:49:23.273]  You're two of the best investigative journalists ever.
[02:49:23.273 --> 02:49:25.314]  I'm going to ask my question.
[02:49:25.314 --> 02:49:28.536]  I'd like to just add a comment.
[02:49:28.536 --> 02:49:30.357]  Go ahead.
[02:49:30.357 --> 02:49:34.039]  Off that first question about the interest rates.
[02:49:34.039 --> 02:49:35.320]  This is a corporate takeover.
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:40.944]  There's no other reason for the destabilizing of governments and nation states.
[02:49:40.944 --> 02:49:42.444]  Corporations are taking over.
[02:49:42.444 --> 02:49:44.906]  They're doing it by decreasing the interest rate.
[02:49:45.908 --> 02:49:46.268]  Thank you.
[02:50:06.673 --> 02:50:07.634]  I totally agree with you.
[02:50:07.634 --> 02:50:11.478]  What's your question for Greg so he can answer it when we come back from break?
[02:50:27.125 --> 02:50:32.491]  Well that depends on if these people win, but yeah, let's look to the future with Greg Powell straight ahead.
[02:50:32.491 --> 02:50:36.696]  Hopefully I'll give him a little bit in the next hour, at least five minutes ahead of Gary Franchi joining us.
[02:50:36.696 --> 02:50:42.522]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:50:42.522 --> 02:50:45.766]  From the shattered Rust Belt come the Lost Vegas.
[02:50:47.639 --> 02:50:49.841]  How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
[02:51:19.255 --> 02:51:32.865]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[02:51:32.865 --> 02:51:35.467]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[02:51:35.467 --> 02:51:36.668]  The Lost Vegas.
[02:51:36.668 --> 02:51:39.851]  Now available at Amazon.com and iTunes.
[02:51:40.231 --> 02:51:44.693]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:51:44.693 --> 02:51:46.174]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:51:46.174 --> 02:51:55.057]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:51:55.057 --> 02:51:58.519]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:51:58.519 --> 02:51:59.579]  But take heart.
[02:51:59.579 --> 02:52:03.341]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:52:03.341 --> 02:52:08.323]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:52:08.743 --> 02:52:12.587]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:52:12.587 --> 02:52:14.309]  The globalists are scared.
[02:52:14.309 --> 02:52:15.651]  They've overreached.
[02:52:15.651 --> 02:52:19.174]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:28.303]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[02:52:43.934 --> 02:52:45.495]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[02:52:45.495 --> 02:52:46.856]  Are you feeling tired?
[02:52:46.856 --> 02:52:48.838]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[02:52:48.838 --> 02:52:49.958]  It's not your fault.
[02:52:49.958 --> 02:52:53.001]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[02:52:53.001 --> 02:52:59.045]  And if you are an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[02:52:59.045 --> 02:53:00.566]  Be the man you used to be.

[02:53:47.094 --> 02:53:52.681]  Okay, folks, it's Alex Jones joining you from southern Utah, big sky country.
[02:53:52.681 --> 02:53:53.902]  It's so gorgeous.
[02:53:53.902 --> 02:53:55.043]  I love this republic.
[02:53:55.043 --> 02:54:04.334]  No wonder the globalists want to bankrupt it and steal all the private property, raise property taxes, and siphon that out through county and city investments to be stolen by the globalists.
[02:54:04.694 --> 02:54:14.642]  Greg Pallas is our guest in this little five-minute segment, the next five-minute segment, and we've got a lot of news and key analysis with Aaron Dykes coming up in the third hour today.
[02:54:14.642 --> 02:54:21.467]  Greg, that's pretty much the same question I asked earlier, but you didn't get to answer because we ran out of time going into a break.
[02:54:21.467 --> 02:54:23.809]  What is the financial future going to look like?
[02:54:27.197 --> 02:54:36.651]  A, if we're able to just imprison these guys and turn this around, or B, if they just have their way and keep driving forward, or is it going to be a mix of the two?
[02:54:36.651 --> 02:54:40.417]  I mean, is Argentina the type of situation we're looking at?
[02:54:43.061 --> 02:54:44.622]  Well, it's kind of up to us.
[02:54:44.622 --> 02:54:48.103]  In the case of Argentina, things hit rock bottom as they did in Ecuador.
[02:54:48.103 --> 02:54:51.324]  People, you know, like I say, teachers eating out of garbage cans.
[02:54:51.324 --> 02:54:55.206]  So people went into the streets banging pots and pans and saying that they weren't going to work.
[02:54:55.206 --> 02:54:56.086]  It's all done.
[02:54:56.086 --> 02:54:57.847]  They have to eat.
[02:54:57.847 --> 02:55:00.448]  And democracy took over and the economy soared.
[02:55:00.448 --> 02:55:02.709]  They told the banks to go buzz off and that's that.
[02:55:03.129 --> 02:55:12.057]  I mean, and the guy who's screaming about it, by the way, the number one, you know, in my book, Vulture's Picnic, the number one vulture financier in America is a guy named Paul Singer.
[02:55:12.057 --> 02:55:16.361]  By the way, he was just named as Mitt Romney's top economic advisor.
[02:55:16.361 --> 02:55:17.382]  Uh, hello.
[02:55:17.382 --> 02:55:24.749]  So what's going to happen, and that doesn't mean that Obama's going to be a better choice, because his top economic advisor is Robert Rubin, you know, of Citibank and Cheryl.
[02:55:27.043 --> 02:55:28.244]  They got both parties.
[02:55:28.244 --> 02:55:29.825]  I just wanted to make it official.
[02:55:29.825 --> 02:55:32.307]  Tell you it's official now.
[02:55:32.307 --> 02:55:42.054]  The Uber vulture, who is screaming bloody murder about Argentina, telling the banks, telling him to take his bonds and fly with them, the vulture.
[02:55:42.594 --> 02:55:46.817]  Ecuador did the same thing, and you know, because democracy took hold.
[02:55:46.817 --> 02:55:48.058]  It was pretty painful.
[02:55:48.058 --> 02:55:50.620]  People went into the streets and were burning down the capital.
[02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:55.304]  The Indians came out of the mountains, but they said, we're going to vote our way to freedom.
[02:55:55.304 --> 02:56:01.408]  We're not going to, you know, we're not going to say, oh, we'll just turn over the banks because we know how difficult it is.
[02:56:01.408 --> 02:56:02.449]  We are out of control.
[02:56:02.449 --> 02:56:06.012]  We spend too much money and the money really should go to the bankers.
[02:56:06.012 --> 02:56:07.633]  But unfortunately, I've seen Europe.
[02:56:08.166 --> 02:56:12.128]  There seems to be no organized dissenting force.
[02:56:12.128 --> 02:56:13.709]  And so where does America stand?
[02:56:13.709 --> 02:56:19.212]  Are we going to be... I mean, maybe this is good.
[02:56:19.212 --> 02:56:26.856]  Maybe this is good to let them go all the way and really show people what gangster globalist tyranny is before people finally wake up.
[02:56:26.856 --> 02:56:28.536]  We'll take another call here.
[02:56:28.536 --> 02:56:29.877]  Craig in Connecticut.
[02:56:29.877 --> 02:56:30.978]  You're on the air with Greg Palast.
[02:56:30.978 --> 02:56:31.478]  Go ahead, Craig.
[02:56:32.304 --> 02:56:34.085]  Great, thanks Alex.
[02:56:34.085 --> 02:56:35.306]  Hi Greg, how are you?
[02:56:35.306 --> 02:56:37.087]  Quick question for you.
[02:56:37.087 --> 02:56:42.631]  You've been doing a lot of analogies to the case with Madoff to MF Global.
[02:56:42.631 --> 02:56:58.122]  I think one key difference that I'm seeing right now is that the trustee, Irving Picard, for the bankruptcy with Madoff, he's been doing a phenomenal job in tracing the assets, where they went, clawing them back from people who had the sweetheart deals.
[02:56:58.903 --> 02:57:01.786]  Do you guys have any insight in terms of the trustee that's here?
[02:57:01.786 --> 02:57:02.747]  Is he a globalist?
[02:57:02.747 --> 02:57:04.188]  Is the trustee to be trusted?
[02:57:04.188 --> 02:57:15.958]  I've talked to Salente and others, and now two, three weeks into this, they're saying, we're not going to discuss where the money is, and you're just not going to get it back.
[02:57:15.958 --> 02:57:25.086]  But then we saw that kind of reverse with the CMT group come in and dump $300 million in, but that's not going to satisfy people, because this is a lot bigger amount.
[02:57:29.253 --> 02:57:35.820]  Well, actually, that's one of the things I'm very concerned about is who exactly is going to be on top of this ship.
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:37.021]  There's two types of trustees.
[02:57:37.021 --> 02:57:37.522]  You're right.
[02:57:37.522 --> 02:57:44.970]  Picard on the Madoff deal, I think he shocked everyone by actually saying, wait a minute, there's some guys who got some sweetheart deals, and he's trying to claw them back.
[02:57:44.970 --> 02:57:46.572]  He doesn't have much legal authority to do that.
[02:57:47.416 --> 02:57:52.379]  Uh, just keep in mind, and he's only been, only one of the big billionaires has given back the money.
[02:57:52.379 --> 02:57:55.361]  Actually, the guy who died, his wife gave it back, and she didn't want blood money.
[02:57:55.361 --> 02:58:09.950]  Uh, but in the case of MF Global, I'm worried we're gonna end up with something like the BP situation, where the number, where the trustees, this guy Ken Feinberg, who's usually used as their big trustee, and, uh, he's known, otherwise known as the reptile.
[02:58:09.950 --> 02:58:12.152]  Now, uh, when they use Feinberg...
[02:58:12.892 --> 02:58:14.594]  More about the reptile on the other side.
[02:58:14.594 --> 02:58:16.277]  Great question, caller.
[02:58:16.277 --> 02:58:17.398]  Great question from Craig.
[02:58:17.398 --> 02:58:18.239]  More calls straight ahead.
