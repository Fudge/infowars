[00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:10.035]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.497]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.297 --> 00:00:13.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:17.402]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:22.087]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:31.287]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm in studio, back in Central Texas.
[00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:39.210]  It is Friday, the 25th day of November, 2011, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:47.594]  We're going to have one of our in-house reporters and researchers, Ron Paul activist Richard Reeves, in studio an hour and a half from now, about 10-15 minutes.
[00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:57.701]  Uh, to talk about the fact that Ron Paul is surging into number one or number two place in every major poll, but the media continues to try to ignore that, the so-called media.
[00:00:58.942 --> 00:01:02.364]  And some strategies that can, uh, probably make sure he wins Iowa.
[00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:06.988]  The Iowa caucus, because that's an old-fashioned raise-your-hand type situation.
[00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:10.570]  Very hard for the establishment criminals to steal that.
[00:01:12.515 --> 00:01:16.796]  So we are going to be breaking all of that down today.
[00:01:16.836 --> 00:01:19.317]  Of course, we didn't have him on last Friday, so we'll have a lot to talk about.
[00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:24.719]  Bob Chapman on the MF Global, the Euro controlled meltdown, and more.
[00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.919]  It's all coming up.
[00:01:26.339 --> 00:01:36.663]  We have the normal beatings and pepper springs and attacks as people run around savagely trying to get discounts on Chinese slave goods, deindustrialization goods.
[00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:38.604]  On Black Friday.
[00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:40.785]  I'd like to hear your Black Friday stories.
[00:01:40.845 --> 00:01:46.448]  All I know is there's a lot more traffic and people running around like fools trying to get big discounts.
[00:01:47.388 --> 00:01:49.649]  So we'll be breaking that down today.
[00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.974]  Also, oh I'm sorry, it was $400 million, then $600, $700 million, then $1 billion, then $1.2 billion, then more than $1.2 billion.
[00:01:59.435 --> 00:02:05.738]  Now there's $3 billion missing according to Reuters from MF Global.
[00:02:08.257 --> 00:02:09.618]  And it's people's private accounts.
[00:02:10.598 --> 00:02:14.540]  And nobody's going to get in trouble because this is the new system where they take everything.
[00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:23.665]  And after all, it's not Black Friday, it's not UT versus A&M last night, so why does it even matter?
[00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.167]  It doesn't matter if we have an economy.
[00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:28.591]  Got something in my eye.
[00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:30.672]  That was for talking bad about UT.
[00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:31.652]  I got something in my eye.
[00:02:31.672 --> 00:02:34.153]  I had family over for Thanksgiving last night.
[00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:39.774]  And sure, it was a good game to sit there and watch simulated combat.
[00:02:41.654 --> 00:02:46.215]  One team, soldiers running out of the pit as gladiators, the others running out.
[00:02:46.996 --> 00:02:56.798]  And all the different generals on the sidelines and the young maidens in waiting, cheering them on, all of it archetypal iconography.
[00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:24.907]  All a simulation of manhood and tribal war, a gilded, castrated population, devoid of thought or freedom or liberty, replacing it all with poison culture, poison food, poison water, poison souls, rotting corpses of a society who believes there's nothing more wholesome
[00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:28.373]  Wholesome than empty tyranny.
[00:03:29.574 --> 00:03:31.755]  So that is all coming up today.
[00:03:33.096 --> 00:03:35.237]  We also have an interesting little tidbit here.
[00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:44.302]  Tokyo Electric Power is following what Monsanto has said in court.
[00:03:45.523 --> 00:03:55.229]  That when Monsanto plants a crop that infects your crops, not only do they not have liability, you have the liability.
[00:03:56.972 --> 00:03:58.033]  You have the liability.
[00:03:58.073 --> 00:04:01.736]  You have trespassed on them, even though they trespassed on you.
[00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:02.357]  And why?
[00:04:02.397 --> 00:04:03.157]  Because they say so.
[00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:05.660]  It's like our media says torture is good.
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.361]  And open borders is good.
[00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:10.103]  And people that don't like world government are bad.
[00:04:10.444 --> 00:04:14.327]  Because world government exists, but it also doesn't exist when the media says so.
[00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:22.995]  Well, now they're saying that they don't have liability for radiation released from their reactors on your property.
[00:04:24.082 --> 00:04:28.323]  Or even spent fuel rods that blasted up to two miles away on other people's property.
[00:04:28.763 --> 00:04:31.504]  In fact, you now own it.
[00:04:32.424 --> 00:04:35.465]  And you're radiating everyone, and you're liable.
[00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:38.526]  And the courts, of course, are ruling absolutely.
[00:04:39.566 --> 00:04:43.067]  If fuel rods shot onto your property, you're bad.
[00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:46.779]  And because they said so!
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.681]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:49.663]  Accept it!
[00:04:50.383 --> 00:04:51.024]  Accept it!
[00:04:52.025 --> 00:04:56.731]  And top people in England are saying basically that pedophiles should be able to take care of children.
[00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:57.832]  Yes, I'm not kidding.
[00:04:58.052 --> 00:04:59.073]  That's coming up as well!
[00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:00.195]  Be right back.
[00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.288]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:10.131]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:10.151 --> 00:05:12.773]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:12.793 --> 00:05:18.237]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:18.658 --> 00:05:24.883]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:25.323 --> 00:05:30.846]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:34.969]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.472]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:45.275]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:48.657]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:49.257 --> 00:05:50.698]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:51.238 --> 00:05:51.659]  It's here.

[00:06:02.068 --> 00:06:03.569]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.833]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:06:09.094 --> 00:06:10.455]  Saving means to make money.
[00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:19.403]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:06:20.143 --> 00:06:27.228]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:06:27.668 --> 00:06:35.293]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:06:35.673 --> 00:06:40.596]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.077]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:25.331]  They are the real deal.
[00:07:25.492 --> 00:07:27.074]  Melvin, you're right about one thing, though.

[00:08:02.253 --> 00:08:04.461]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:07.854]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:20.455]  All right, I am back in the saddle again, back here at home base at Central Texas, deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[00:08:21.335 --> 00:08:27.958]  We're going to be live on the air here for at least the next three hours, and then of course there's InfoWorks Nightly News this evening, 7 o'clock.
[00:08:28.818 --> 00:08:32.700]  I want to give the number out here in a moment to talk about any issue you wish to discuss.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.882]  But first, I do want to mention just some of the news that's going to be coming up throughout the broadcast today.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:45.685]  But I've literally probably got more than 200 articles here in front of me and a lot of this I've read over.
[00:08:46.185 --> 00:08:48.146]  Some of this I haven't even gotten to yet.
[00:08:48.206 --> 00:09:04.018]  I was looking up on screen about a minute before we went into this segment and I saw on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com the headline, Green Debacle, Tens of Thousands of Abandoned Wind Turbines Now Litter American Landscape.
[00:09:05.563 --> 00:09:08.625]  And it's funny, because I have footage of this driving out west.
[00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:14.469]  I drove through New Mexico, into Arizona, and then into southern Utah, and then back.
[00:09:15.849 --> 00:09:27.957]  And all along the way, in Texas and other states, I would see wind turbines, the big giant ones, off on the horizon, not turning, even when there was wind.
[00:09:29.558 --> 00:09:32.620]  And then I'd drive a few more miles and see wind turbines that were turning.
[00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:34.042]  When there was wind.
[00:09:34.543 --> 00:09:38.164]  Some days, such high wind, the RV was almost blowing off the road.
[00:09:38.184 --> 00:09:39.685]  About, like, 50 mile an hour winds.
[00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:48.628]  And then, I was going to do some investigating into this when I got back, and I shot some footage of it, and I was going to do a nightly news report, but voila!
[00:09:48.748 --> 00:09:59.393]  November 24th, yesterday, Thanksgiving, natural news, Jonathan Benson, green debacle, tens of thousands of abandoned wind turbines, now litter American landscape.
[00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:11.945]  And it says that 14,000 of them, more than that, and it has links to all the government documents, have been abandoned because it was government programs.
[00:10:11.985 --> 00:10:16.132]  They would just build them, not even service them, get the government handout.
[00:10:17.193 --> 00:10:24.462]  That's why in Spain they said it took at least two jobs, on top of the money it cost, away from the economy to build a wind turbine.
[00:10:25.183 --> 00:10:27.486]  And then they never can transfer the power properly.
[00:10:27.506 --> 00:10:33.654]  You need to build power plants near cities because you lose a lot of the power as you transmit it down the major lines.
[00:10:34.355 --> 00:10:52.445]  So they've got these in England and Europe and the United States and Canada way off the middle of nowhere on mountain ridges and then they're supposed to or on the Texas coast and I've seen them sitting idle on the Texas coast because it's just like all these other big energy companies where they build green buildings and then just never even hire anybody.
[00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:53.866]  It's just all a big scam.
[00:10:54.267 --> 00:11:02.511]  All a big insider deal where Al Gore and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and Clinton and Obama are all heavily invested.
[00:11:02.551 --> 00:11:03.352]  It's a bunch of gangsters.
[00:11:04.699 --> 00:11:11.403]  Literal beacons of the green energy movement, giant wind turbines have been one of the renewable energy sources of choice for the U.S.
[00:11:11.443 --> 00:11:17.447]  government, which has spent billions of taxpayer dollars subsidizing the construction and use across the country.
[00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:30.095]  But high maintenance costs, high rates of failure, and fluctuating weather conditions that affect energy production render wind turbines expensive and inefficient, which is why more than 14,000 of them, or more, have since been abandoned.
[00:11:30.155 --> 00:11:31.116]  And then it goes through all of it.
[00:11:31.998 --> 00:11:33.139]  Now again, here's my frustration.
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.382]  If you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, give me a document cam shot.
[00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:37.924]  No exaggeration.
[00:11:37.964 --> 00:11:46.791]  I bet if I count these articles, there are more than 200 of them on my desk, and each one is more insane than the next.
[00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.033]  I mean, look at this one.
[00:11:48.453 --> 00:11:51.316]  Sex offenders, including pedophiles, should be allowed to adopt.
[00:11:51.976 --> 00:11:54.478]  Top advisors to the government are saying in England.
[00:11:54.799 --> 00:11:55.880]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[00:11:57.038 --> 00:12:05.700]  The Tokyo Electric is saying it's your fault if the radiation got on your property and that you're basically trespassing on that radiation.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.261]  That's out of mainstream news in Japan.
[00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:11.902]  Cannot make it up.
[00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:15.102]  Bonkers, cuckoo, nutcase.
[00:12:16.303 --> 00:12:17.603]  But the judges in
[00:12:18.956 --> 00:12:21.798]  Japan and here are all under a globalist system.
[00:12:22.058 --> 00:12:22.938]  It's all standardized.
[00:12:22.998 --> 00:12:26.020]  And they're gonna, just like Monsanto, infect your crops.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.121]  You have proof you bought your non-GMO seeds.
[00:12:29.442 --> 00:12:30.562]  They infect your crops.
[00:12:30.862 --> 00:12:33.124]  They find 1% of their genetics in your crops.
[00:12:33.744 --> 00:12:36.585]  And then they sue you for them contaminating it.
[00:12:37.366 --> 00:12:44.930]  This would be like if I broke in your house while you were out of town for a month and put 10 dogs in there to go to the bathroom all over the floor.
[00:12:46.516 --> 00:13:05.124]  And I fed them a hundred gallons of Hamburger Helper, and you come back home and there's just urine and feces knee-deep, and then I sue you for trespassing against me when I broke in your house and put twenty, thirty, fifty, a hundred dogs in there, force-feeding them hamburger meat.
[00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:09.752]  Except that's just something that screws your house up.
[00:13:09.952 --> 00:13:10.713]  You gotta clean up.
[00:13:10.933 --> 00:13:14.955]  This is genetic garbage designed to sterilize us and give us cancer.
[00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:19.317]  In all the documents on all, just type in GMO linked to cancer, birth defects.
[00:13:19.337 --> 00:13:22.879]  You'll just have hundreds of studies out the wazoo going back 30 years.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.621]  And here they say, TEPCO, radioactive substances belong to landowners, not us.
[00:13:29.062 --> 00:13:31.543]  But if you actually read the full article, they're spinning it.
[00:13:33.322 --> 00:13:45.709]  During court proceedings concerning a radioactive golf course, Tokyo Electric Power stunned lawyers by saying the utility was not responsible for decontamination because it no longer owned the radioactive substances.
[00:13:47.148 --> 00:14:04.002]  Now, under common law, it goes back to the Bible, if your ox gets out and gores somebody, your big work cow, your cow that pulls trailers, gets out and runs over somebody's kid and kills them off your property, you are 100% responsible.
[00:14:04.222 --> 00:14:05.303]  And it's like that in every culture.
[00:14:05.523 --> 00:14:14.410]  They just say, no, no, and my ox jumped out of the pen and got mad and ran over and killed your wife or husband or child, whatever.
[00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:15.111]  We just don't.
[00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:16.512]  But then they go further.
[00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:21.543]  And they're saying, now you're going to have to clean it up and you've got the liability.
[00:14:21.803 --> 00:14:23.304]  So it's not even as bad.
[00:14:23.484 --> 00:14:24.544]  It's totally insane.
[00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:25.925]  It goes against logic.
[00:14:26.865 --> 00:14:28.746]  But official media said so.
[00:14:28.846 --> 00:14:30.787]  Governments, corporations.
[00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:35.709]  It's not as bad as Montana, because then they actually come in and then say you've stolen their property.
[00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:38.130]  But it's pretty darn close.
[00:14:39.811 --> 00:14:40.492]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:14:40.592 --> 00:14:41.592]  ACLU.
[00:14:42.773 --> 00:14:47.555]  Senators demand military lockup for Americans in Battlefield to find us outside your window.
[00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:58.574]  And yes, the new battlefield for killing Americans without courts, arresting Americans, the military, tribunals, is anywhere in the U.S., anywhere in the world.
[00:15:01.255 --> 00:15:04.516]  And that Americans can be arrested and held without charge or trial.
[00:15:04.556 --> 00:15:06.097]  Just the complete martial law.
[00:15:07.297 --> 00:15:09.918]  I've got that report and it's got quotes from Ron Paul in here.
[00:15:11.299 --> 00:15:13.320]  But hey, does the average American care about this?
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.461]  Is the average American concerned about that?
[00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:15.521]  No!
[00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:30.845]  No, the average American is concerned about getting a discount and I guess getting their paycheck and getting out and buying some Chinese slave goods that break the first time you get it out of the box on average.
[00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:37.430]  They're obsessed with running out and getting into deeper debt or whatever the case is.
[00:15:38.626 --> 00:15:42.629]  They're not worried about cancer tripling and diabetes tripling in the last few decades.
[00:15:43.089 --> 00:15:46.592]  They're not worried about all the new wars.
[00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:57.160]  They're not worried about the hypocrisy, the Arab League meeting in Cairo while Western-backed military system machine guns crowds and puts in surreal law.
[00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:06.648]  They're meeting there to discuss human rights abuses in Syria that, if they are going on, are minimal compared to Egypt.
[00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:08.895]  We're not worried about that.
[00:16:09.175 --> 00:16:17.582]  The Arab League is there saying, yes, we want military action, and the Russians have got warships off the coast to defend, and then the United States has got an aircraft carrier.
[00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:23.588]  They're getting ready to put a peaceful, remember those, non-military, no-fly zone.
[00:16:23.608 --> 00:16:24.929]  That means bombing the whole country.
[00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:32.576]  And then when they put the al-Qaeda rebels in, as they did in Libya, literally flying the al-Qaeda flag, they'll call it humanitarian.
[00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:38.336]  Humanitarian.
[00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:49.286]  It's humanitarian that they've got 7,000 people at least admitted in a concentration camps and they're systematically murdering people.
[00:16:50.066 --> 00:16:50.947]  More than 40,000.
[00:16:52.328 --> 00:16:54.751]  No, it's peaceful and humanitarian.
[00:16:56.664 --> 00:16:57.445]  But this is happening.
[00:16:57.465 --> 00:17:11.259]  I mean, I'm living in 1984, and there's all these news articles I've got about where the government's openly calling for censorship of talk radio, demonizing yours truly for influencing the White House shooter who thought he was Jesus.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.863]  They're really gearing up to take everything.
[00:17:18.683 --> 00:17:21.846]  And I sat there with family last night at my house for Thanksgiving.
[00:17:22.006 --> 00:17:22.767]  We had it at my house.
[00:17:22.827 --> 00:17:23.427]  It was fun.
[00:17:23.888 --> 00:17:26.891]  And I even enjoyed watching the football game.
[00:17:28.012 --> 00:17:28.932]  Two seconds left.
[00:17:29.113 --> 00:17:30.534]  UT field goal.
[00:17:32.556 --> 00:17:33.497]  A movie finish.
[00:17:33.557 --> 00:17:34.598]  A photo finish.
[00:17:35.859 --> 00:17:42.185]  And I sat there and I watched people having a tribal victory of satisfaction that UT had defeated
[00:17:43.592 --> 00:17:48.958]  The ANM hordes festooned in their military regalia.
[00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:51.881]  But the New World Order was still there.
[00:17:51.981 --> 00:17:53.843]  The GMOing of the food was still there.
[00:17:53.903 --> 00:17:56.385]  The cancer viruses and the vaccine was still there.
[00:17:56.646 --> 00:17:57.847]  And I knew all the archetypes.
[00:18:01.209 --> 00:18:06.675]  The home team's army running out of the gladiatorial underground base out to face the enemy.
[00:18:06.895 --> 00:18:11.199]  The young maidens out there presenting themselves to the warriors.
[00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:15.423]  The maidens will be handed to the young men that defeat the foreign tribe.
[00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:39.455]  That's one tribe on one side, the other tribe on the other, University of Texas in the enemy's camp, behind enemy lines, all of its systematic social engineering, archetypal iconography, total programming, intermixed with advertisements and brainwashing and all the rest of it, the last rivalry in 115 years.
[00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:40.275]  Why?
[00:18:40.415 --> 00:18:42.116]  Why am I not concerned with it?
[00:18:42.437 --> 00:18:42.777]  Why?
[00:18:42.897 --> 00:18:44.738]  Something's wrong with me, you see!
[00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:45.979]  I'm not a man!
[00:18:47.952 --> 00:18:54.398]  I shouldn't be concerned about the end of America, the end of the dollar, the attack on the family, World War III being engineered.
[00:18:54.938 --> 00:18:58.301]  Because after all, I was given a football game.
[00:19:02.105 --> 00:19:08.611]  I shouldn't be concerned with all the police state things I saw while I traveled the country that just stunned me, worse than I even thought.
[00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.731]  I shouldn't be concerned.
[00:19:14.851 --> 00:19:21.314]  Oh, oh, MF Global was 400 million, 600 million, 700 million, a billion, 1.2 billion, more than 1.2 billion.
[00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:26.416]  Today, Reuters says it's 3 billion of people's private accounts stolen, and you're not getting them back.
[00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:27.456]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:19:28.257 --> 00:19:29.777]  A new precedent, and so what?
[00:19:31.038 --> 00:19:35.460]  That doesn't matter if they take people's private bank accounts or brokerage accounts.
[00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.742]  After all, Chase McCoy
[00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:44.399]  Defeated the tribe that was wearing purple.
[00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:49.085]  The prunes or whatever the other team's called.
[00:19:49.966 --> 00:19:58.978]  Again, I shouldn't be concerned by this false reality scientifically set up to manipulate our tribal primitive instincts.
[00:20:02.327 --> 00:20:05.290]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:08.553]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:23.748]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[00:20:24.068 --> 00:20:24.588]  We're good to go!
[00:20:41.974 --> 00:20:42.595]  We're good to go.

[00:21:31.953 --> 00:21:36.336]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:36.516 --> 00:21:42.220]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.742]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.140]  Why Ali-C?

[00:24:18.942 --> 00:24:21.062]  Everything the globalists engage in, I study it.
[00:24:22.523 --> 00:24:23.203]  Every move they make.
[00:24:26.124 --> 00:24:38.486]  And when I look at the general public, on average, who is completely unconscious of the fact that they're being bombarded with propaganda, that they're being physically poisoned, those aren't just words.
[00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:40.287]  You're being assaulted.
[00:24:41.707 --> 00:24:42.887]  And it's a mind game, though.
[00:24:43.168 --> 00:24:44.448]  If somebody's dog starts...
[00:24:46.024 --> 00:24:50.207]  digging holes in your yard, to go back to the dog analogies, most people will get angry.
[00:24:51.128 --> 00:24:55.131]  Especially if they learn that the neighbor knows their dog is doing that and doesn't care.
[00:24:56.271 --> 00:25:07.360]  And if you said something to your neighbor about it, nicely, hey Bill, your dog's digging holes in my yard and digging out my plants and killing them, and if the neighbor said, well Bob, I don't care, get out of my face.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:08.420]  Got a problem?
[00:25:08.801 --> 00:25:13.304]  You, even if you were a nice guy, would have to control yourself not to get in a fist fight.
[00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:24.958]  Hey, but the scientists genetically engineered the major food crops to absolutely screw up your endocrine systems, to reduce your fertility.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.281]  The documents are public.
[00:25:28.321 --> 00:25:29.081]  We've published them.
[00:25:29.101 --> 00:25:30.242]  We've written articles about it.
[00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:34.205]  And you tell the average person that, and they're like, yeah, right.
[00:25:34.625 --> 00:25:36.387]  Okay, well, everybody knows the government's doing stuff.
[00:25:36.407 --> 00:25:37.127]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:25:37.427 --> 00:25:38.308]  You see, that's what it is.
[00:25:38.608 --> 00:25:39.769]  You feel powerless.
[00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.292]  The globalists are masters of psychology.
[00:25:45.874 --> 00:25:50.155]  And they have learned how humans tick and how humans operate, whole-bloodedly.
[00:25:51.775 --> 00:26:08.119]  And that's what frustrates me, because yes, it's sophisticated, but when you're aware of it, you still have your instincts, you're still who you are, but those instincts were designed for another system, a primitive system, where humans were in groups of no bigger than 20 or 30.
[00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:15.153]  And now we're in this false technological system that was designed.
[00:26:15.513 --> 00:26:22.218]  Technology was focused for hundreds of years in certain ways to control populations.
[00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:24.499]  And now it's been brought to a high science.
[00:26:26.021 --> 00:26:27.802]  The problem is you reap what you sow.
[00:26:27.842 --> 00:26:29.063]  There is a feedback loop.
[00:26:30.945 --> 00:26:43.048]  And as hard as the ruling class social engineers, the human architects, as hard as they try to stay out of their own system, it is blowing back on them so bad.
[00:26:45.988 --> 00:26:46.829]  And that's the parable.
[00:26:47.609 --> 00:26:48.729]  We see the parable everywhere.
[00:26:49.489 --> 00:26:57.831]  Emperor Palpatine, Revenge of the Sith, tries to try somebody and it blasts back on him.
[00:27:01.264 --> 00:27:03.166]  That's in every major archetype.
[00:27:05.327 --> 00:27:07.649]  And that's basically what the elite are doing.
[00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:14.655]  And I'm watching humanity mutate and fall apart and become stunted right in front of my eyes.
[00:27:15.936 --> 00:27:18.017]  And I talk to the general public and they're in a trance.
[00:27:18.338 --> 00:27:20.799]  Oh, they may even go, yeah, Alex, you're right about the New World Order.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.361]  Now, will you please stop talking about it?
[00:27:22.461 --> 00:27:23.682]  The game is about to begin.
[00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:33.651]  The game, I mean, I should be 24-7 climbing up on top of billboards, spray-painting messages of liberty.
[00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:49.014]  I'm not saying do that, but, you know, I should be doing, and you should be doing, bullhorning on street corners, going to city council every week, running for office, clawing at every point you can to get the word out.
[00:27:52.115 --> 00:27:53.455]  I mean, I've talked a lot about this, but
[00:27:56.206 --> 00:28:11.733]  The fact that now, when Chernobyl happened in 86, for six months, they wouldn't let the children in Europe, Northern, Southern, Eastern, you name it, drink the local milk or eat local vegetables.
[00:28:11.753 --> 00:28:17.996]  They had to be thrown away because they knew that that was where it was raining down on and then bio-accumulating in it.
[00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:29.475]  They didn't want the children getting massive increases in leukemias and other cancers directly connected to radioactive isotopes, or meltdowns.
[00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:40.760]  Today, similar, in some cases higher levels are hitting the United States, much higher levels in Japan, and the same thing in Japan.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.042]  They're not stopping the milk, the produce, they're just saying eat it!
[00:28:45.137 --> 00:28:46.278]  And here they're just saying eat it.
[00:28:46.698 --> 00:28:51.600]  Okay, levels went up from Connecticut to Colorado to California.
[00:28:57.362 --> 00:28:58.002]  We don't care.
[00:29:01.864 --> 00:29:04.445]  We don't care, just we're going to raise the levels of what's safe.
[00:29:05.546 --> 00:29:08.667]  I know I talk a lot about that, but it's a fundamental change.
[00:29:08.727 --> 00:29:10.868]  It's like the common sense
[00:29:12.142 --> 00:29:18.707]  Life preservation, public safety life force, switch, has been flipped off.
[00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:23.270]  The globalists flipped it off in the general public, to a great extent.
[00:29:26.393 --> 00:29:28.454]  But they've now flipped it off in themselves.
[00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:31.316]  Because there's no way the globalists are immune from this.
[00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:35.700]  And then you read their writings, a lot of the higher level ones are actually conscious of that.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.142]  And they say, yes, the goal is to kill everything.
[00:29:38.762 --> 00:29:39.603]  We just want to kill.
[00:29:41.203 --> 00:29:42.324]  We just want to kill humanity.
[00:29:42.344 --> 00:29:48.887]  And then you find out you're literally dealing with demon-possessed creatures.
[00:29:50.528 --> 00:29:51.428]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.928 --> 00:29:53.509]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.449 --> 00:29:57.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.138 --> 00:30:05.361]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.301]  Number one.
[00:30:06.601 --> 00:30:09.743]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:10.584]  Number two.
[00:30:10.884 --> 00:30:15.427]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:16.208]  It's true.
[00:30:16.508 --> 00:30:21.071]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.391 --> 00:30:21.931]  Number three.
[00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:25.493]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.794 --> 00:30:29.496]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.696 --> 00:30:30.257]  Number 4.
[00:30:30.497 --> 00:30:32.859]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:36.643]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.944 --> 00:30:37.484]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.724 --> 00:30:41.649]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:46.634]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.914 --> 00:30:50.937]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.097 --> 00:30:52.658]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:52.878 --> 00:30:54.959]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:55.139 --> 00:30:57.721]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:30:57.741 --> 00:31:02.064]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:02.084 --> 00:31:08.808]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:31:09.048 --> 00:31:11.330]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:16.795]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:31:16.975 --> 00:31:19.758]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:31:20.018 --> 00:31:22.140]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:28.265]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:31.789]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:31:31.969 --> 00:31:37.454]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:31:37.734 --> 00:31:39.055]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:31:39.376 --> 00:31:40.577]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:31:40.677 --> 00:31:43.219]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:47.403]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:31:47.563 --> 00:31:52.067]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:52.207 --> 00:31:54.650]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:57.772]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:31:57.792 --> 00:31:58.413]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.141]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:06.481 --> 00:32:14.602]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:15.342 --> 00:32:19.383]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:19.963 --> 00:32:30.785]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:31.425 --> 00:32:40.428]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:40.928 --> 00:32:45.970]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:53.533]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:53.853 --> 00:32:56.254]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:33:11.565 --> 00:33:13.266]  Alright, I'm going to give you the toll-free number.
[00:33:14.467 --> 00:33:16.929]  We're going to take your calls while we go through the news.
[00:33:18.911 --> 00:33:19.551]  The toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[00:33:19.571 --> 00:33:19.611]  800-259-9231.
[00:33:19.631 --> 00:33:20.912]  We will get you up and on the air.
[00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:23.514]  Here's another article out of the literally 200-plus I have here.
[00:33:38.533 --> 00:33:42.016]  Criminals and cyberbullies to be banned from the web.
[00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:42.856]  London Telegraph.
[00:33:43.517 --> 00:33:46.479]  Well, thank goodness criminals and cyberbullies will be banned.
[00:33:48.701 --> 00:33:54.645]  But worldwide, under the same standardized plan, they've introduced similar legislation here.
[00:33:57.147 --> 00:34:07.075]  If you ever say something bad about someone, including a corrupt dirtbag politician, well, there's no free speech if you hurt someone's feelings.
[00:34:09.781 --> 00:34:12.984]  Then you will be fined or arrested.
[00:34:14.445 --> 00:34:16.908]  They already do this in Europe and now it's coming here.
[00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:30.260]  Criminals who commit offenses online, but it'll all be selectively enforced of course, and cyber bullies will be banned from the internet as part of the government's new cyber security strategy announced today.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.162]  Now, how do they ban you from the Internet?
[00:34:36.362 --> 00:34:39.944]  Oh, what's been built in for, what, five years in all the Microsoft systems?
[00:34:41.365 --> 00:34:42.506]  An Internet ID.
[00:34:42.566 --> 00:34:54.712]  It's just waiting to be implemented, and thumbprinting, and digital face scanning to access the web, to authenticate that you're allowed to be online.
[00:34:56.513 --> 00:34:58.514]  They also are talking about using voice print.
[00:34:59.075 --> 00:35:00.936]  You know about different programs, why?
[00:35:03.174 --> 00:35:14.523]  If you try to upload some music to YouTube that you don't own, within seconds of it going live, it's already been scanned by the software that recognizes it and knows what song it is.
[00:35:15.124 --> 00:35:16.084]  It's voice print.
[00:35:16.605 --> 00:35:18.226]  And now they're moving to voice print.
[00:35:20.088 --> 00:35:25.772]  And Lieberman's back in the news, calling for censorship of the Internet.
[00:35:27.353 --> 00:35:31.597]  It calls for police and courts to make more use of existing cyber sanctions
[00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:39.064]  To restrict access to social networks and instant messaging services in case of hacking, fraud and online bullying.
[00:35:39.664 --> 00:35:46.748]  Sex offenders and those convicted of harassment and other anti-social behavior also face more internet restrictions under the new strategy.
[00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:49.069]  The new strategy, yes.
[00:35:49.429 --> 00:35:51.630]  Oh, but here's another article out of the same telegraph.
[00:35:54.352 --> 00:35:58.574]  Sex offenders, including pedophiles, should be allowed to adopt
[00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:10.541]  That's right, and it says that the government is being advised in the new vetting scheme that, well, let pedophiles adopt children.
[00:36:11.301 --> 00:36:12.983]  Let sex offenders be teachers.
[00:36:13.063 --> 00:36:14.684]  Come on, they've got rights too.
[00:36:16.345 --> 00:36:19.027]  That's right, and you're a bigot.
[00:36:20.068 --> 00:36:22.570]  You're a bigot if you don't like Jerry Sandusky.
[00:36:25.012 --> 00:36:25.993]  You listen to that interview he did?
[00:36:28.725 --> 00:36:31.407]  The reporter asked him, he says, well, are you attracted to children?
[00:36:31.427 --> 00:36:34.110]  He's like, well, I don't know.
[00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:37.654]  In fact, we should play that letter, Jared.
[00:36:37.674 --> 00:36:38.615]  I meant to play that last week.
[00:36:38.635 --> 00:36:39.075]  I never did.
[00:36:39.115 --> 00:36:40.496]  We ought to queue up that creep.
[00:36:40.516 --> 00:36:51.227]  And of course, the reporter who six months ago forced all this out in the paper locally is saying, oh, yeah, this goes into children.
[00:36:52.372 --> 00:36:57.355]  being brought through this system through the second mile and other systems to donors.
[00:36:57.895 --> 00:36:58.676]  Of course!
[00:36:59.956 --> 00:37:03.659]  Who else but this type of garbage would come up with this?
[00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:05.520]  Who else but these people?
[00:37:09.382 --> 00:37:21.509]  The system is run by very sick freaks at the top and then they've got a whole army of mercenaries and compartmentalized
[00:37:23.376 --> 00:37:27.999]  Phony tough, who only want power.
[00:37:28.099 --> 00:37:28.700]  And you know what?
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.261]  The God of this world is going to give it to them.
[00:37:34.844 --> 00:37:40.628]  Especially when those of us that love good and recognize good stand down and do nothing.
[00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:43.870]  I talked about it while I was out of town.
[00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.052]  The corrupt system is opening the gates of hell.
[00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:56.599]  Let me get to these articles and I'll go to your calls and I'm going to come back and go through the rest of it.
[00:37:56.619 --> 00:37:59.922]  But, you know, I don't even think I'm going to cover this today.
[00:37:59.942 --> 00:38:13.310]  This is what I got at the Grand Canyon because I unpacked a lot of stuff and this morning I was in a hurry and I couldn't find a big stack of newspapers and things that I had picked up along the way.
[00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:19.734]  It seemed like everywhere I'd go, I'd walk into a gas station in northern New Mexico and there'd be the local paper.
[00:38:21.977 --> 00:38:23.558]  And it would say, girls night out.
[00:38:24.639 --> 00:38:30.102]  The female, all female police units set up checkpoints on highways and search cars.
[00:38:33.283 --> 00:38:39.787]  And so I said to Richard Reeves in the gas station, he was with me, while we're standing in line, two other people in front of us, I said, look at this.
[00:38:40.367 --> 00:38:41.228]  Look at this checkpoint.
[00:38:41.248 --> 00:38:45.530]  Look how it's all women, how they play men off against women in this compartmentalization.
[00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:48.252]  And there's a Navajo woman behind the counter.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.441]  Because it seems like in Navajo Country, I mean, I know that women run things, but it seems like also women are pretty much the ones that work.
[00:38:55.142 --> 00:38:57.902]  It was just always, everywhere I went, groceries stores, you name it, Navajo women.
[00:38:58.382 --> 00:39:01.183]  Security guards, behind the counter, everywhere, Navajo women.
[00:39:01.903 --> 00:39:03.464]  And she heard me, she goes, that's right!
[00:39:03.644 --> 00:39:05.504]  You'd be surprised what women can get done!
[00:39:05.524 --> 00:39:09.926]  And I went, oh, I know, is that the Navajo culture, where women run things?
[00:39:09.946 --> 00:39:10.806]  She goes, yes it is.
[00:39:12.912 --> 00:39:14.773]  And then I saw her with a guy buying beer in front of me.
[00:39:15.373 --> 00:39:17.494]  The guy looked like he was 45, construction worker.
[00:39:18.295 --> 00:39:22.137]  I saw her take his driver's license, scan it, and then say, be careful out there!
[00:39:22.157 --> 00:39:26.839]  And I went, oh, you're making sure, he's bad buying beer, you're making sure.
[00:39:27.299 --> 00:39:30.681]  And she was like, you know, got all upset with me.
[00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.902]  And I said, so you enjoy the system, you like this in the newspaper right here.
[00:39:34.523 --> 00:39:39.165]  This was a whole case of them right there.
[00:39:41.013 --> 00:39:42.394]  I said, you know, you like this.
[00:39:42.574 --> 00:39:43.334]  She's like, yeah, I do.
[00:39:43.354 --> 00:39:46.096]  I'm like, you like all the power the state gives you.
[00:39:46.396 --> 00:39:47.777]  You like minding everybody, don't you?
[00:39:48.897 --> 00:39:50.738]  And I kind of just shut up there.
[00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:53.180]  And she goes, you be careful out there driving.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.160]  And I said, I will.
[00:39:56.802 --> 00:40:01.304]  But I didn't want to go into the whole thing of anthropology, sociology, psychology.
[00:40:01.984 --> 00:40:05.026]  I didn't go into, did you know there's Roman manuals from 1800 years ago?
[00:40:07.742 --> 00:40:12.826]  That were used all over the Caribbean for slavery, both of the natives and blacks that were shipped in.
[00:40:13.426 --> 00:40:17.309]  And how they would take the women and set them up over the men as the minders.
[00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:20.271]  Do you know about that?
[00:40:20.631 --> 00:40:21.332]  I didn't dare.
[00:40:21.392 --> 00:40:28.077]  I just looked at her and I said, the New World Order that you're empowering is what's destroyed your people and was going to destroy everybody else.
[00:40:28.337 --> 00:40:30.358]  And I turned to the crowd, it was a packed gas station.
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:35.462]  I turned to the whole crowd and I said, this system is going to destroy you.
[00:40:37.054 --> 00:40:39.755]  I said, if you can't recognize it, you deserve to be destroyed.
[00:40:40.536 --> 00:40:45.939]  And I said to her, and I said, you will be judged for serving this system, as we all will be.
[00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:50.641]  See, it's time to let people know, you will be judged.
[00:40:51.062 --> 00:40:52.863]  You have opened the gates of hell.
[00:40:55.904 --> 00:41:02.848]  And she was shaking when I left, and that's good, because I have the light of truth, and any who seek it will have it.
[00:41:04.463 --> 00:41:06.505]  I choose reality and not weakness.
[00:41:06.885 --> 00:41:10.008]  And I spit this modern world out of my mouth.
[00:41:10.688 --> 00:41:13.711]  And all the evil, I repent for my wickedness.
[00:41:15.132 --> 00:41:17.174]  And I'm as wicked as the day is long.
[00:41:17.934 --> 00:41:20.877]  That's why God has chosen me and many other men who've been wicked.
[00:41:21.537 --> 00:41:25.340]  Because we can see and we truly know the bitter burden of evil.
[00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:27.202]  And I want no part of it!
[00:41:28.042 --> 00:41:28.383]  Ever!
[00:41:30.444 --> 00:41:32.026]  All of us are unbelievably evil.
[00:41:33.308 --> 00:41:34.428]  And I want no part of it!
[00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:37.689]  And it's recognizing evil from good that is the beginning!
[00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:47.511]  Goodness is success and beauty and health and creativity and blessings so incredible you can't handle it!
[00:41:49.211 --> 00:41:58.693]  Evil is twisted, stunted, crippled, painful, blinded, humiliated, freezing,
[00:42:00.575 --> 00:42:01.215]  Desperate!
[00:42:01.796 --> 00:42:02.556]  Stinking!
[00:42:03.617 --> 00:42:04.037]  Hurt!
[00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:07.339]  It's rubble!
[00:42:07.419 --> 00:42:08.720]  It's torn down cities!
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:10.181]  It's starving children!
[00:42:10.842 --> 00:42:12.483]  It's the smell of rotten flesh!
[00:42:13.323 --> 00:42:17.346]  It's the evil control freaks turned loose to run over all of us!
[00:42:17.546 --> 00:42:18.347]  FOREVER!
[00:42:21.168 --> 00:42:22.389]  And I will have no part of it!
[00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:24.871]  I will have no part of it!
[00:42:28.234 --> 00:42:29.876]  Everywhere I went, it was police state.
[00:42:30.136 --> 00:42:32.738]  Every newspaper, every magazine, every system.
[00:42:33.198 --> 00:42:41.646]  I walk into the Grand Canyon, every restaurant we went to, whether it was a little cafeteria, or the fancy old lodge.
[00:42:49.092 --> 00:42:51.294]  The Grand Canyon book.
[00:42:52.735 --> 00:42:54.197]  Give me a document cam shot, please, here.
[00:42:55.953 --> 00:42:56.954]  Here's a great idea.
[00:42:57.034 --> 00:42:59.717]  Become a Grand Canyon National Park Junior Ranger.
[00:43:01.439 --> 00:43:02.279]  This is a thick book.
[00:43:02.319 --> 00:43:03.661]  It's full of little jewels.
[00:43:04.842 --> 00:43:11.369]  And I went to multiple gift shops to buy my children some children's clothes.
[00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:16.233]  And they had, literally, in these gift shops, in some cases, hundreds of different variants of adult clothing.
[00:43:17.321 --> 00:43:26.183]  But nothing for children, but three different variants for boys and girls, so six total, of junior ranger little Hitler youth outfits.
[00:43:27.764 --> 00:43:31.805]  And of course the Forest Service people and park rangers, they acted pretty thuggish.
[00:43:32.625 --> 00:43:34.726]  Had a few run-ins with them for no reason.
[00:43:35.106 --> 00:43:37.446]  Saw them bossing others around for no reason.
[00:43:38.046 --> 00:43:40.047]  Anti-human lectures endlessly.
[00:43:42.935 --> 00:43:48.859]  And it says here, complete this booklet, and it's pretty thick, and bring it into them, and they'll give you a badge.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:56.364]  And then, of course, when you get there, it also gives you a discount if you fill it out on coupons to get the little Hitler Youth outfit.
[00:43:58.245 --> 00:44:08.953]  This is the Grand Canyon Activity Book, and it tells you in here how to spy on your parents, only in America and East Germany, and how to not take hot baths, and how to
[00:44:11.189 --> 00:44:16.093]  Tell your parents how to, you know, tattle on them if they don't turn the lights off in their hotel room.
[00:44:29.185 --> 00:44:30.726]  It's better to laugh than to cry, isn't it?
[00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.593]  And as they infect our crops worldwide with death,
[00:44:39.665 --> 00:44:45.630]  Then they have their courts come in when they sue you and rule against you when they infect you.
[00:44:46.271 --> 00:44:50.655]  When their radiation gets on your property, it's your problem they infected you.
[00:44:51.115 --> 00:45:07.069]  The whole law of common sense, of organic galactic law turned on its head where evil has all rights and good is an enemy to be hunted down and exterminated!
[00:45:09.013 --> 00:45:11.194]  Or the parents are to be overthrown!
[00:45:11.214 --> 00:45:13.776]  Or the men are to be overthrown!
[00:45:13.796 --> 00:45:20.981]  Or our women, our servants, dependent on the states.
[00:45:22.142 --> 00:45:30.027]  Or the men are disaffected, frozen in an addled youth state of arrested development.
[00:45:31.991 --> 00:45:42.144]  Where our children are completely given over to the state, and the chemicals, and the brainwashing, and the commercialism, and the soulless video games!
[00:45:43.746 --> 00:45:49.213]  With a simulated murder and rapine endlessly stacked upon evil!
[00:45:54.327 --> 00:46:05.238]  Unmitigated, unparalleled, volcanic, tectonic eruptions of pain and suffering and curses!
[00:46:08.361 --> 00:46:12.745]  Absolute hell on earth just waiting to roll out!
[00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:16.589]  You think these dungeon doors that have flown open to release evil
[00:46:20.335 --> 00:46:26.778]  The simpering vipers turned loose on our world are only the beginning.
[00:46:29.479 --> 00:46:33.500]  They're only the cannon fodder of the true evils that are going to be visited upon us.
[00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:38.582]  And if the establishment media doesn't say something's important, it isn't covered.
[00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:41.803]  Or if it is, it's in the back of the news.
[00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:45.505]  As I told you two days ago,
[00:46:49.088 --> 00:46:55.712]  As I told you on Tuesday, first it was 600 million, on and on and on, 1.2 billion, more than 1.2 billion.
[00:46:56.233 --> 00:47:07.721]  Oh, today, Reuters is reporting that anger mounts as MF Global clients see 3 billion still stuck.
[00:47:10.122 --> 00:47:18.648]  And they're saying some people will get their money back, but most
[00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:23.193]  Will not get their money back.
[00:47:26.756 --> 00:47:41.609]  Because the bankruptcy trustee, regulators, and exchanges have had no comment on the missing funds in weeks, and have given no information as to how much cash they are retaining, customers are left guessing exactly how much might end up in the creditors' process of the bankruptcy.
[00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:43.171]  Well, you know why.
[00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:46.574]  The head of the CFTC's invested in all this with the Corzine.
[00:47:49.414 --> 00:47:51.415]  But I better not call Corzine a criminal.
[00:47:51.776 --> 00:47:54.958]  They might revoke my internet privileges.
[00:47:54.978 --> 00:47:56.819]  Because everything's a privilege.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.903]  To own a gun, to have a right to life, to have a right to your own property is a privilege.
[00:48:01.503 --> 00:48:02.364]  Travel's a privilege.
[00:48:02.384 --> 00:48:05.266]  Of course, none of it's a privilege, but the system says so!
[00:48:06.673 --> 00:48:12.714]  And so, the little enforcers who would have no future but to be a little boss, a little toady of the system.
[00:48:13.254 --> 00:48:18.055]  Every authoritarian society hires sociopaths and thugs, and that conversion's now happening.
[00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:21.476]  The wedge of totalitarianism firmly driven.
[00:48:25.356 --> 00:48:31.817]  And they're just saying, hey, here's another article out of The Independent.
[00:48:32.417 --> 00:48:33.878]  What price new democracy?
[00:48:33.938 --> 00:48:35.298]  Goldman Sachs conquers Europe.
[00:48:36.991 --> 00:48:39.632]  And it goes on to say, Goldman Sachs now runs Europe.
[00:48:40.492 --> 00:48:53.335]  The very group that engineered the collapse, and see, it's so naked, it's so brazen, it's so waddling, just out in the open.
[00:48:54.155 --> 00:49:04.598]  But you look at the public, you try to talk to a man, say a 50-year-old insurance salesman, who makes $300,000 a year, and they think, if you warn them about this, they think you're showing off.
[00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:13.836]  See, if the American people, they like to sit around and talk about sports and show off to each other, how many team members they know, how many plays they know.
[00:49:14.697 --> 00:49:17.899]  And so if you try to warn them about something, hey, are you concerned about this?
[00:49:17.919 --> 00:49:18.660]  What do you think we ought to do?
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:23.884]  Oh, you're showing off about finance stuff.
[00:49:25.686 --> 00:49:27.627]  No, no, no, I'm trying to warn you.
[00:49:28.508 --> 00:49:29.509]  What do you think we ought to do?
[00:49:32.421 --> 00:49:43.270]  It's like I'm at the Grand Canyon and we're about to leave, and I go, let's go find that visitor center on the southeast rim, because that's where they had the UN sign, where they threatened to arrest me a few years, you know, 14 years ago.
[00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.813]  So I go there, they've torn down the old visitor center, they got this giant one there now.
[00:49:48.857 --> 00:49:49.638]  Nobody's around.
[00:49:49.658 --> 00:49:50.959]  There's like ten people inside.
[00:49:50.979 --> 00:49:53.260]  There's like two or three walking by every five minutes outside.
[00:49:53.701 --> 00:49:59.745]  So I get my iPhone out and I start shooting a video of the plaque that they've got off on the side of the building saying it's a U.N.
[00:49:59.765 --> 00:50:00.265]  takeover.
[00:50:00.866 --> 00:50:05.329]  And I'm just really quietly over there talking and I hear an old guy come up behind me and he goes, what's he talking about?
[00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:07.411]  Because the slaves don't talk in America.
[00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:09.352]  It's weird to see somebody talking.
[00:50:09.933 --> 00:50:11.334]  I mean, talking's not patriotic.
[00:50:12.199 --> 00:50:14.820]  And he goes, hold on, I'll be in there in a minute to his wife.
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:18.462]  I'll find out with this guy.
[00:50:18.522 --> 00:50:20.123]  As soon as he's done talking.
[00:50:21.524 --> 00:50:23.044]  Videos up on Infowars.com.
[00:50:23.064 --> 00:50:26.586]  As soon as he's done talking, I'm gonna take a photo of this!
[00:50:28.027 --> 00:50:30.528]  He didn't like the fact I was talking!
[00:50:31.715 --> 00:50:35.498]  Because he heard I was talking about America being taken over by foreign banks and the U.N.
[00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.961]  And he had like American flags and veteran stuff all over it.
[00:50:39.622 --> 00:50:42.664]  And to him it's anti-patriotic to say America's in trouble.
[00:50:43.905 --> 00:50:47.328]  I need to just watch football and wear American flags.
[00:50:47.368 --> 00:50:52.192]  I bet if I'd have said to him, how about them cowboys, he'd have looked at me like I was a good American.
[00:50:52.953 --> 00:50:58.638]  But because I actually know that's been handed over in receivership, like the Greek islands, that was wrong!
[00:50:59.318 --> 00:51:00.139]  And I was bad!
[00:51:01.331 --> 00:51:06.335]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:02.263]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:52:02.543 --> 00:52:12.997]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:52:13.197 --> 00:52:17.283]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:52:17.643 --> 00:52:20.065]  But we can't do that without your help.

[00:52:31.674 --> 00:52:34.837]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:52:35.157 --> 00:52:40.801]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:52:41.281 --> 00:52:50.787]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:52:51.188 --> 00:52:52.368]  The war is here.
[00:52:52.689 --> 00:52:54.110]  It's an info war.
[00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.272]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:53:01.054 --> 00:53:06.799]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible to shop for?
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:14.306]  How would you like the ability to get top-of-the-line, hard-to-find gifts at equally hard-to-beat prices without leaving the comfort of your home?
[00:53:14.727 --> 00:53:15.648]  Why fight the crowd?

[00:53:45.191 --> 00:53:47.131]  A gift that could truly make a difference.
[00:53:47.211 --> 00:53:53.473]  Go to OffTheGridChristmas.com and our Christmas video highlighting perfect gifts for the Off The Grid fans and your family.
[00:53:53.633 --> 00:53:54.313]  Unbeatable gear.
[00:53:54.433 --> 00:53:55.313]  Unbeatable prices.
[00:53:55.413 --> 00:53:56.253]  No more searching.
[00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:57.854]  OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:53:58.074 --> 00:53:59.834]  That's OffTheGridChristmas.com.
[00:54:09.437 --> 00:54:18.262]  Yeah, I'm wound up and I'm in a nasty mood because I want people to start recognizing corruption and evil for what it is and taking it on.
[00:54:19.623 --> 00:54:25.607]  Because evil will grow and take over and you'll get a Nazi Germany, a Soviet Russia, a Communist China.
[00:54:27.428 --> 00:54:28.388]  I mean, that's the norm.
[00:54:28.448 --> 00:54:36.333]  And I'm freaked out, folks, because the globalists have said that's what they're setting up is a high-tech, authoritarian, anti-human system.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:45.564]  And so imagine if you were in 1937 Germany and knew what was going on and we're over here trying to warn people in America and nobody would help you.
[00:54:45.864 --> 00:54:46.344]  That happened.
[00:54:47.265 --> 00:54:52.648]  People knew what the Soviets were doing in the 20s and 30s, but he was called Uncle Joe Stalin on our news.
[00:54:53.508 --> 00:54:55.149]  He'd already killed tens of millions of people.
[00:54:55.669 --> 00:55:01.652]  He'd already killed more people than Hitler had, Lenin, and then Stalin had, before Hitler even got going.
[00:55:03.113 --> 00:55:04.074]  People tried to warn.
[00:55:05.815 --> 00:55:06.335]  And the
[00:55:08.561 --> 00:55:10.442]  Different civil liberties groups will come after you.
[00:55:12.923 --> 00:55:17.666]  And here I am warning people, folks, it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:55:17.726 --> 00:55:19.307]  It's never going to get better from here on out.
[00:55:20.187 --> 00:55:22.509]  It's designed to be post-industrial.
[00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:24.110]  Do I need to quote Ted Turner?
[00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.570]  Bill Clinton?
[00:55:26.391 --> 00:55:27.111]  Jacques Cousteau?
[00:55:27.692 --> 00:55:28.432]  Maurice Strong?
[00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:31.634]  Hanson?
[00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:34.352]  Or Henson at NASA.
[00:55:34.852 --> 00:55:38.035]  Do I need to quote all the documents as I've done over and over again in the video clips?
[00:55:38.495 --> 00:55:40.557]  They want you poor!
[00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:47.763]  Just like what did Russell Means say in that film we did with him, Welcome to the Reservation.
[00:55:48.744 --> 00:55:49.665]  Welcome to the Reservation.
[00:55:50.245 --> 00:55:50.706]  And it's true.
[00:55:51.126 --> 00:55:54.809]  Everything that was tested out on the Native Americans is the worldwide model.
[00:55:55.009 --> 00:55:56.551]  They want you in controlled areas.
[00:55:58.303 --> 00:55:59.444]  Not self-sufficient.
[00:55:59.504 --> 00:56:00.805]  That's why they're targeting Amish.
[00:56:01.205 --> 00:56:11.692]  That's why they're targeting... While I was out West, they're giving the Navajo Homeland Security is setting up a national ID card for them to track them and control them.
[00:56:16.695 --> 00:56:17.996]  And sure enough, I did research.
[00:56:18.056 --> 00:56:19.857]  It's the women contingent.
[00:56:20.117 --> 00:56:21.558]  I'm not even attacking these women.
[00:56:21.738 --> 00:56:22.658]  They're attacking them all.
[00:56:23.159 --> 00:56:26.401]  Hitler said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:35.307]  We have a nation where men are encouraged to act like little boys forever, and where the women are encouraged to be the boss.
[00:56:35.687 --> 00:56:37.829]  And you see it in feminism, you see it everywhere today.
[00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:39.831]  And society is wrecked.
[00:56:41.213 --> 00:56:45.076]  Totally and completely wrecked and falling apart.
[00:56:46.016 --> 00:56:51.339]  Men think manhood is painting themselves up and getting drunk and going and screaming at a football game.
[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.941]  And folks, I'm not judging you because you like a football game.
[00:56:54.241 --> 00:56:55.922]  I sat there last night and enjoyed it.
[00:56:55.942 --> 00:56:56.903]  It was a good football game.
[00:56:57.583 --> 00:57:01.265]  But I knew that it wasn't important at the end of the day.
[00:57:01.826 --> 00:57:11.591]  I mean, I watched people on the sidelines when it was back and forth in the game, totally freaked out on both sides, like their child was under the operating knife.
[00:57:12.572 --> 00:57:15.074]  Like their child was having open-heart surgery and might die.
[00:57:15.094 --> 00:57:22.340]  I mean, I saw the full-grown men and women, everybody just... Meanwhile, they don't care about their bank accounts.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.221]  They don't care about the future of the country.
[00:57:24.461 --> 00:57:25.102]  They don't care.
[00:57:25.402 --> 00:57:26.983]  It's all false.
[00:57:27.564 --> 00:57:29.225]  They create these false avenues.
[00:57:29.585 --> 00:57:31.146]  And the system's using it for that.
[00:57:31.467 --> 00:57:33.048]  And I just want you to be conscious of that.
[00:57:35.757 --> 00:57:38.258]  I just want you to be conscious of what's happened to our society.
[00:57:38.698 --> 00:57:39.979]  And I want to reach more people.
[00:57:40.059 --> 00:57:42.099]  I want you to spread InfoWars.com.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.400]  I want you to get it out to your email list.
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:52.123]  I want you to get it out to your church, your synagogue, your mosque, whatever you're into, your atheist group, whatever.
[00:57:52.543 --> 00:57:54.904]  We've got to get focused, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:56.485 --> 00:57:58.485]  We've got to get these bankers out of here.
[00:57:58.685 --> 00:58:02.387]  They're now admitting a world government run by Goldman Sachs.
[00:58:03.649 --> 00:58:05.090]  And the other members of the Federal Reserve.
[00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:10.072]  It's in AP today that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are really one bank.
[00:58:10.312 --> 00:58:11.212]  I've told you that forever.
[00:58:11.713 --> 00:58:12.913]  It's just the details are secret.
[00:58:13.153 --> 00:58:15.814]  But we know about the original deal.
[00:58:15.894 --> 00:58:16.134]  In 1913.
[00:58:18.335 --> 00:58:20.116]  I told you the bailout went to Europe, mainly.
[00:58:20.596 --> 00:58:22.477]  Folks, we study this.
[00:58:23.798 --> 00:58:25.579]  We know where it's going.
[00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:27.740]  It's not going a nice place.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.481]  We gotta get off this train.
[00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:32.791]  We gotta get off this train.
[00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:34.112]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:58:35.633 --> 00:58:37.214]  And all I want to do is warn the people.
[00:58:37.514 --> 00:58:38.795]  Please, help me!
[00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:47.761]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.432 --> 00:58:56.035]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:58:56.436 --> 00:58:59.438]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:58:59.678 --> 00:59:04.462]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:59:04.482 --> 00:59:10.708]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:59:10.868 --> 00:59:13.110]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:13.930]  Tim Geithner?
[00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:14.371]  Bernanke?
[00:59:14.471 --> 00:59:15.091]  They're arsonists!
[00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:16.332]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:59:16.372 --> 00:59:18.654]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:59:32.546 --> 00:59:34.387]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:59:34.407 --> 00:59:39.449]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:49.754]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:59:54.035 --> 00:59:55.976]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.437 --> 00:59:59.198]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.834 --> 01:00:10.035]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.675 --> 01:00:11.495]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.255 --> 01:00:13.156]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.796 --> 01:00:17.396]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.997 --> 01:00:22.117]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.279 --> 01:00:34.480]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm just so desperate to turn this around.
[01:00:35.686 --> 01:00:36.587]  I'm so desperate.
[01:00:38.408 --> 01:00:49.057]  Man, when you read Rockefeller Foundation documents, where they were developing in the 60s stuff added to vaccines just to reduce fertility, without telling the public, you see the White House science are shooting his mouth off about it.
[01:00:49.878 --> 01:00:52.200]  You understand you're under a geoengineering program.
[01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:56.404]  God, just the stuff we know is so horrible.
[01:00:56.424 --> 01:00:58.746]  I don't even want to imagine.
[01:00:59.963 --> 01:01:05.086]  I don't even want to imagine, because every time I imagine something, I'm able to go do research and discover it's happening.
[01:01:05.146 --> 01:01:06.607]  If you can think of it, they're doing it.
[01:01:09.228 --> 01:01:17.593]  If you can think of it, and that's the key, they say, to military operations and espionage and all of it, is getting into the enemy's mind, and I've done it.
[01:01:18.913 --> 01:01:22.856]  And I can see right through their eyes, and it is unbelievable.
[01:01:25.337 --> 01:01:26.978]  It is hyper-total dominance.
[01:01:29.022 --> 01:01:30.923]  What is the most pure form of dominance?
[01:01:31.063 --> 01:01:31.683]  It is killing.
[01:01:32.684 --> 01:01:34.024]  It is just getting rid of your enemy.
[01:01:34.665 --> 01:01:41.448]  If you exterminate every last creature, then you have dominated it.
[01:01:42.628 --> 01:01:45.690]  Our ancestors in Europe exterminated the giant cave bear.
[01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.791]  Hunted them until extinction.
[01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:51.953]  Once the prey, now the predator.
[01:01:54.834 --> 01:01:56.535]  The same with the big-toothed cats, all of them.
[01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:03.804]  Snakes in many areas of the world have been hunted to extinction.
[01:02:06.266 --> 01:02:07.386]  Many species of shark.
[01:02:10.688 --> 01:02:15.110]  The New World Order are humans that are predators, and the prey is their own species.
[01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:15.710]  They're cannibals.
[01:02:16.311 --> 01:02:18.352]  They're social and psychological cannibals.
[01:02:22.394 --> 01:02:23.635]  And I don't like being the prey.
[01:02:25.355 --> 01:02:26.876]  You may like being prey, I don't.
[01:02:28.257 --> 01:02:30.218]  You may like the enemy feeding on you, I don't.
[01:02:31.906 --> 01:02:33.766]  You may like their designs and think they're cute.
[01:02:33.947 --> 01:02:34.227]  I don't.
[01:02:34.887 --> 01:02:37.768]  I run into so many, and this is really a key point that I'm going to your calls.
[01:02:39.768 --> 01:02:58.593]  I run into so many people who think they're part of the establishment, who will, I run into chemists, biologists, doctors, normally that type of professional in the scientific field, who will say, okay, but there are too many people, Alex.
[01:02:59.778 --> 01:03:00.779]  And that's another argument.
[01:03:01.199 --> 01:03:03.561]  And I look at him for the sake of argument and I say, let's say there is.
[01:03:04.282 --> 01:03:05.102]  So you're for this.
[01:03:05.262 --> 01:03:06.644]  And they're like, well, something's got to be done.
[01:03:07.044 --> 01:03:10.527]  And I look at him and I say, so you like your food and water being messed with?
[01:03:11.027 --> 01:03:12.228]  They're like, no, I didn't say that.
[01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.830]  Well, that's the reality, idiot!
[01:03:19.614 --> 01:03:23.257]  You aren't on the winning team, moron!
[01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:29.322]  And that goes for you, sociopath and psychopath cops and people out there.
[01:03:31.596 --> 01:03:35.179]  You think you're winners working for this?
[01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:39.543]  You think you're allowed to engage in all this crime?
[01:03:39.563 --> 01:03:43.065]  And taser old people to death and stuff just came out this week?
[01:03:44.306 --> 01:03:49.491]  You think they're hiring all these pedophiles and perverts at the TSA because they're gonna stop there?
[01:03:50.552 --> 01:03:59.299]  You think they're converting the police and military over to gangbangers and crooks just because it's fun and because they want to give you some power?
[01:04:09.696 --> 01:04:12.577]  You are sitting there weaving your own rope!
[01:04:14.018 --> 01:04:17.759]  Sticking it around my neck and sticking it around your neck and you're idiots!
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.680]  You're idiot scum!
[01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:21.901]  You're weak!
[01:04:22.981 --> 01:04:25.222]  Someone who's strong wants to build up humanity.
[01:04:25.442 --> 01:04:27.323]  Someone who's strong wants to defend the weak!
[01:04:27.603 --> 01:04:28.924]  Not chew their guts out!
[01:04:29.064 --> 01:04:30.244]  But you'd never know that!
[01:04:30.464 --> 01:04:32.965]  Because you're soulless and you're turned over to wickedness!
[01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:37.347]  And the only satisfaction I have is to know that you're gonna be caught in your own trap!
[01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:40.478]  You're gonna fall into your own pit!
[01:04:41.698 --> 01:04:42.819]  Cowardly trash!
[01:04:42.839 --> 01:04:45.420]  I could break your neck!
[01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.962]  I could sever your head with my two hands!
[01:04:48.202 --> 01:04:49.162]  You scum!
[01:04:52.024 --> 01:04:55.706]  Now we're coming back after this break with phone calls!
[01:04:56.026 --> 01:04:57.987]  And as you can tell, I'm rested!
[01:05:02.392 --> 01:05:06.695]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:05:07.096 --> 01:05:12.960]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:05:13.521 --> 01:05:15.282]  Number one, study the past.
[01:05:15.803 --> 01:05:17.564]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:05:18.205 --> 01:05:21.927]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:05:23.041 --> 01:05:25.302]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:05:26.143 --> 01:05:29.405]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:05:29.985 --> 01:05:34.707]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:05:35.028 --> 01:05:38.469]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:41.891]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:05:42.432 --> 01:05:46.074]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:51.180]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:05:51.861 --> 01:05:55.966]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:05:56.467 --> 01:05:59.171]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.820]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:08.523]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:08.783 --> 01:06:11.084]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:06:11.344 --> 01:06:16.526]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:19.487]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:21.828]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:06:22.068 --> 01:06:27.993]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.313 --> 01:06:31.516]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:37.241]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:06:37.481 --> 01:06:38.802]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:39.122 --> 01:06:40.323]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:06:40.423 --> 01:06:42.965]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:06:43.105 --> 01:06:47.149]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:49.350]  You can find the video at www.
[01:06:50.111 --> 01:06:51.812]  End of America 3.com.
[01:06:51.932 --> 01:06:54.373]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:08:05.987 --> 01:08:10.192]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[01:08:10.812 --> 01:08:11.633]  You want answers?
[01:08:12.394 --> 01:08:13.395]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.936 --> 01:08:17.540]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:22.285]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.369 --> 01:08:27.811]  Alright, I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:35.461]  Then I'll get into all the Mideast News, Climategate, Tube, JFK, Whitewashing, MF Global, 3 billion missing now.
[01:08:36.562 --> 01:08:39.724]  Says the regulators won't tell the public, they say the first time ever.
[01:08:40.164 --> 01:08:42.085]  Reuters reports they won't tell them where the money went.
[01:08:42.405 --> 01:08:43.446]  Well of course they won't!
[01:08:43.966 --> 01:08:45.407]  The regulators are getting the money!
[01:08:46.387 --> 01:08:51.270]  Like four years ago with Henry Paulson getting 200 and something mil of bailout money he gave himself.
[01:08:54.092 --> 01:08:55.913]  We've reached a new twilight zone level where
[01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.479]  GMO crops infect your crops and you get in trouble for it.
[01:09:00.519 --> 01:09:04.721]  Or radiation blows out of a reactor melting down and then you get in trouble for it.
[01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:06.262]  I mean, that's actually in the news today.
[01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:09.023]  We're entering the land of la-la.
[01:09:10.143 --> 01:09:11.103]  The land of criminal.
[01:09:11.123 --> 01:09:14.605]  All right, I'm going to your calls.
[01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:16.906]  I want to show PrisonPlanet.tv or something.
[01:09:17.766 --> 01:09:20.707]  Kurt Nemos here working hard on this post-holiday day.
[01:09:21.227 --> 01:09:22.828]  We were sent this in.
[01:09:23.728 --> 01:09:25.469]  Rob Doo is going to go over and get some footage of it.
[01:09:26.867 --> 01:09:39.370]  But I've talked about these billboards up all over the country pushing get motivated with the war criminal Colin Powell who knowingly got up and lied about anthrax knowing that they were mobile British made hydrogen blimp trucks.
[01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:41.170]  It was in Jane's Weapons Quarterly.
[01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:48.192]  We actually looked at them and saw them on the news and went to Jane's Weapons Quarterly online and made the announcement nine years ago.
[01:09:48.212 --> 01:09:52.693]  About six months before the war started or whatever and actually broke
[01:09:53.998 --> 01:09:59.141]  Uh, that they were hot air balloon artillery directing systems.
[01:10:00.241 --> 01:10:04.823]  They would rig cameras on them and then run them up, you know, 10,000 feet and then direct artillery with it.
[01:10:04.843 --> 01:10:06.104]  The Iran-Iraq War, the U.S.
[01:10:06.124 --> 01:10:06.864]  and England armed them.
[01:10:08.345 --> 01:10:10.906]  McChrystal helped cover up the murder of Pat Tillman.
[01:10:10.926 --> 01:10:14.248]  Giuliani helped cover up the truth of 9-11.
[01:10:17.785 --> 01:10:20.147]  And that they were doing a drill of the towers being attacked that day.
[01:10:20.167 --> 01:10:25.191]  He said they were, then he got caught, then he said that they weren't, then he testified before Congress that they were.
[01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:27.753]  So, 9-11's an inside job, got painted on.
[01:10:27.793 --> 01:10:35.259]  Giuliani, yellow cake, war criminal, lying about the uranium out of Niger, is for Colin Powell.
[01:10:37.361 --> 01:10:46.529]  So Giuliani, Colin Powell, and the other guy, McChrystal, they all got spray-painted, or I don't know, that's signs that are stuck up there, I'm not sure.
[01:10:48.524 --> 01:10:51.306]  But that's, uh, we think it's poster board.
[01:10:52.647 --> 01:10:54.049]  So it's not even spray paint.
[01:10:54.609 --> 01:10:56.671]  Interesting, yeah, and I thought it looked really, really bright.
[01:10:57.792 --> 01:11:02.336]  Uh, but, uh, so I guess they didn't even damage the all-powerful, almighty, uh, billboard.
[01:11:02.356 --> 01:11:04.257]  That's probably a good idea.
[01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:05.598]  You know, what's a bigger crime?
[01:11:05.638 --> 01:11:11.243]  Putting some poster board up on a billboard to make a political statement that's incredibly protected under the First Amendment?
[01:11:11.824 --> 01:11:13.725]  Or to lie to the public to take you to war?
[01:11:15.106 --> 01:11:16.688]  And to tell the public torture is cool.
[01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:32.375]  You know, I watched Clockwork Orange yesterday, and it's a dystopic novel on a police state future, where they hire the thugs, the street gangs, to become the police, and then they waterboard people.
[01:11:34.037 --> 01:11:44.125]  And then the state itself is involved, which is run by psychopaths, in social engineering of the general public, and using operant Pavlovian
[01:11:46.332 --> 01:11:50.815]  Skinner type conditioning on the public, which is what the entire society is.
[01:11:51.055 --> 01:11:53.316]  I mean, do you like being in a Petri dish manipulated?
[01:11:53.336 --> 01:11:54.117]  That's my point.
[01:11:57.328 --> 01:12:04.692]  99% of the political views out there are literal petri dish stimuli, false paradigm, limited spectrum information.
[01:12:04.932 --> 01:12:08.593]  You've got to get full spectrum understanding to see how the world works.
[01:12:09.294 --> 01:12:16.157]  You've got to study sociology, anthropology, psychology, a basic history, military history.
[01:12:17.642 --> 01:12:18.422]  Religious history.
[01:12:19.122 --> 01:12:26.144]  Because humans act the same, and the elites use the same playbooks that have worked, they just soup them up and turbocharge them today.
[01:12:26.564 --> 01:12:27.944]  And then they write books, it's incredible.
[01:12:28.424 --> 01:12:40.167]  All the time I read globalist documents that are public, that are exact things I've thought of word for word, and then it's them, separately, decades before, saying it the same way, but from a position of supporting it.
[01:12:41.716 --> 01:12:50.463]  I have organically seen what they're doing thousands of times and then in hundreds of cases later run into them saying exactly that.
[01:12:55.086 --> 01:12:58.869]  The real science on this planet is human manipulation.
[01:12:59.369 --> 01:13:02.552]  If you know that science, you get everything else.
[01:13:03.769 --> 01:13:12.694]  You get the factories, you get the weapons, you get the women, you get the power, and after you've had total power over civilizations, you start trying to change humans.
[01:13:13.615 --> 01:13:15.896]  And then, you say, why not just get rid of them?
[01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:21.719]  There's too many of them at the Grand Canyon, there's too many of them, you know, in the airways, they're eating up too much of the resources, just kill them.
[01:13:21.979 --> 01:13:22.680]  Well, how do we do that?
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:26.682]  We teach them to hate themselves by feeling sorry for the animals.
[01:13:27.062 --> 01:13:31.545]  We don't really care about the animals and the earth, but we'll have them turn their own
[01:13:33.522 --> 01:13:37.925]  Survival instinct against themselves and think of the earth as what matters and not themselves.
[01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:41.047]  Now watch and learn.
[01:13:41.067 --> 01:13:46.371]  And people will sit there and call for their own destruction.
[01:13:47.912 --> 01:13:49.694]  Thinking it's fashionable and cool.
[01:13:51.435 --> 01:13:54.177]  All the while doing nothing to actually help the earth.
[01:13:54.557 --> 01:13:55.398]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[01:13:55.438 --> 01:13:56.538]  I'm gonna shut up now.
[01:13:57.219 --> 01:13:58.580]  I've got so much more to cover though.
[01:14:00.593 --> 01:14:07.719]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:14:09.341 --> 01:14:14.305]  Well, I would not believe how hard they push vaccines if I hadn't seen it for myself.
[01:14:14.406 --> 01:14:16.788]  My wife and I recently had our second child.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:25.222]  There's three doctors in my hometown of Dover, Pennsylvania that have refused to see my child because I will not vaccinate him.
[01:14:25.302 --> 01:14:26.882]  Oh yeah, that's on InfoWars today.
[01:14:26.902 --> 01:14:35.724]  And then now they're gonna then say, just like they kicked you out of school for not vaccinating, and then charged you with truancy, even though they triggered it.
[01:14:35.824 --> 01:14:36.624]  It's all fraud.
[01:14:37.464 --> 01:14:40.985]  They're now saying if you don't take your kid to the doctor, you're abusive.
[01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:44.291]  But then they're not seeing your child.
[01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:45.892]  You meant to travel 50 miles.
[01:14:46.292 --> 01:14:48.393]  That's what they're more and more doctors that know it's bad.
[01:14:49.354 --> 01:14:50.175]  Where are you calling from?
[01:14:51.115 --> 01:14:52.176]  Dover, Pennsylvania.
[01:14:53.777 --> 01:14:57.419]  How far away is Ohio from Pennsylvania?
[01:14:57.439 --> 01:14:58.059]  Pretty close, isn't it?
[01:14:58.880 --> 01:15:00.201]  No, not from where I'm at.
[01:15:00.261 --> 01:15:02.122]  It's probably 200 plus.
[01:15:02.482 --> 01:15:03.323]  Well, you got to do it.
[01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:08.465]  It's just like organic food wasn't on store shelves 12, 15 years ago, and now it is everywhere.
[01:15:08.485 --> 01:15:11.187]  And of course they make counterfeits, but that's okay.
[01:15:11.247 --> 01:15:12.048]  It's all part of the process.
[01:15:12.368 --> 01:15:15.310]  You've got to support doctors that are non-vaccine.
[01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:22.835]  Look, have you done a search engine for your area and non-vaccinating doctors?
[01:15:24.176 --> 01:15:24.956]  No, I haven't yet.
[01:15:25.257 --> 01:15:27.178]  My son was actually just born over the weekend.
[01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:31.652]  Listen, my children have had zero vaccines.
[01:15:32.092 --> 01:15:36.094]  Have you seen the studies where the flu shot only helps you with their own numbers?
[01:15:36.114 --> 01:15:44.437]  1.4% of the chance or 98.6% of the time it doesn't help you and then it reduces their immunity to the flu the next year by 50%?
[01:15:45.518 --> 01:15:46.578]  Major Canadian studies?
[01:15:47.599 --> 01:15:56.683]  I've taken these documents with me to the doctors and they've literally called me stupid and told me I'm going to kill my child by not vaccinating.
[01:15:58.032 --> 01:15:59.193]  Well, that's because they're desperate.
[01:15:59.493 --> 01:16:02.055]  The public, the majority have turned against them.
[01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.557]  So that's why you're seeing a doubling and tripling.
[01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:12.603]  It's like when a horse tries to throw you, you really dig your spurs in, you start whipping them, with the reins between the eyes.
[01:16:13.363 --> 01:16:16.005]  And right now they're like, you do what I say!
[01:16:16.025 --> 01:16:20.048]  And they've gotten off the horse, and they got that whip, and they're whipping us right now.
[01:16:20.068 --> 01:16:21.549]  They're going, you're going to do what I said!
[01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:24.932]  And they're trying to geld us.
[01:16:24.972 --> 01:16:25.893]  We're still a stallion.
[01:16:26.684 --> 01:16:34.650]  You know, they put Prozac in our water and our food, but that's what the fluoride is, but again, they're beating us right now, going, you listen to me, horse.
[01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:36.612]  You listen to me, like me mule.
[01:16:37.112 --> 01:16:38.754]  You do what I say right now.
[01:16:40.295 --> 01:16:41.176]  So what happened from there?
[01:16:42.757 --> 01:16:44.258]  I pretty much said, have a nice day.
[01:16:44.278 --> 01:16:47.681]  I'll never deal with your practice, and I'll find somebody that believes the way I believe.
[01:16:48.742 --> 01:16:49.803]  Well, sir, I'll say this.
[01:16:50.283 --> 01:16:52.225]  The science of immunization
[01:16:54.315 --> 01:16:56.757]  Does work to a certain extent.
[01:16:57.417 --> 01:16:58.918]  It's been around 500 years at least.
[01:16:59.579 --> 01:17:02.180]  Quantified the last 250 with smallpox and things.
[01:17:04.582 --> 01:17:07.063]  But it carries a lot of other problems with it.
[01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:08.705]  Now, take that out of the equation.
[01:17:10.145 --> 01:17:21.413]  Like it lowers immunity, it's been linked to increases in cancer, because your body doesn't know how to deal with things, and so when you start getting cancer, it doesn't go and kill that itself, because it thinks some outside force is supposed to do it.
[01:17:21.733 --> 01:17:22.854]  There's a lot of studies out there.
[01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:43.042]  But the main issue is, you can bring the stupid doctor all the government documents where they admit they're adding things to vaccines, or the recalls of vaccines, and show that to them, but they don't want to look because they're committed to the cult, and to the power trip, and to you're an idiot and know nothing.
[01:17:45.049 --> 01:17:47.590]  I mean, sir, you know who ran the Aztec kingdoms.
[01:17:47.610 --> 01:17:50.171]  You know who the priests were in the Roman times.
[01:17:50.451 --> 01:17:51.351]  They were the doctors.
[01:17:51.451 --> 01:17:56.193]  The doctors were always part of the priesthood, generally the top of it.
[01:17:57.313 --> 01:17:59.394]  And they also studied psychology.
[01:18:00.514 --> 01:18:03.675]  I mean, look at the sign of medicine going back a couple thousand years.
[01:18:03.795 --> 01:18:05.196]  Double helix snakes.
[01:18:05.236 --> 01:18:05.836]  It's DNA.
[01:18:06.876 --> 01:18:08.657]  This is part of the lower priesthood.
[01:18:09.557 --> 01:18:10.918]  And they practice on you.
[01:18:11.926 --> 01:18:21.409]  I mean, doctors a hundred years ago would just routinely take a small child and ram a ice pick through their eye into their brain in front of students.
[01:18:21.429 --> 01:18:39.376]  You can actually type in, doctor uses ice pick on child, and you'll see photos, mainstream articles, and women, men, whatever, and some of the first recordings were done about a hundred years ago, and you can hear, there's photos with it, laughing as they record the procedure, as the young
[01:18:40.396 --> 01:18:40.796]  Oh yeah.
[01:19:06.854 --> 01:19:08.415]  But there are real doctors out there.
[01:19:08.976 --> 01:19:11.098]  You have to go to Sherry Tenpenny.
[01:19:11.118 --> 01:19:11.578]  Call her.
[01:19:11.999 --> 01:19:14.161]  We need to create an index of good doctors.
[01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:16.022]  Dr. Eisenstein in Illinois.
[01:19:16.703 --> 01:19:25.031]  He's done the studies to show that out of, what is it, 200-something thousand Amish and Mennonites in Illinois, no known cases of autism.
[01:19:26.352 --> 01:19:26.832]  Now it's 1 in 58.
[01:19:26.872 --> 01:19:27.013]  Was 1 in 25,000.
[01:19:30.455 --> 01:19:31.436]  Just about 30 years ago.
[01:19:31.996 --> 01:19:33.177]  It's a epidemic.
[01:19:33.497 --> 01:19:35.198]  It is a cursed plague.
[01:19:36.079 --> 01:19:37.760]  It's all scientific.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:44.164]  See, most children just get a basic stunting and roasting of the higher IQ.
[01:19:44.584 --> 01:19:46.145]  An IQ that would be 140 is now 110.
[01:19:46.526 --> 01:19:49.628]  An IQ that would be 100 is now 80.
[01:19:49.848 --> 01:19:52.069]  To give you a dead reckoning.
[01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:59.134]  But with some children, they have too big an autoimmune inflammation and so then the child is brain damaged to where it's noticeable.
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.302]  Introducing a diabetes breakthrough.
[01:20:03.582 --> 01:20:06.745]  An easy, natural, organic way to bring relief to diabetics.

[01:22:05.290 --> 01:22:06.510]  Everyone can feel it.
[01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:15.233]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[01:22:15.693 --> 01:22:18.834]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[01:22:19.114 --> 01:22:19.995]  But take heart.
[01:22:20.015 --> 01:22:23.676]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:22:23.956 --> 01:22:28.938]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[01:22:29.358 --> 01:22:32.900]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.641]  The globalists are scared.
[01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:35.922]  They've overreached.
[01:22:36.262 --> 01:22:39.404]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[01:23:57.549 --> 01:23:58.029]  Versatile.
[01:23:58.289 --> 01:23:59.009]  Instafire.
[01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:05.012]  Oh lordy, my troubles so hard.
[01:24:06.132 --> 01:24:09.594]  Oh lordy, my troubles so hard.
[01:24:10.014 --> 01:24:12.715]  Don't nobody know my troubles.
[01:24:14.767 --> 01:24:21.252]  When I got upset by watching the football game last night, it was the brainwashing, the commercials.
[01:24:22.713 --> 01:24:27.517]  Watching my family, who are all awake to the New World Order, just easing into the false culture.
[01:24:28.437 --> 01:24:30.759]  See, I've made a real break with this culture.
[01:24:31.279 --> 01:24:32.460]  It's a false culture.
[01:24:32.961 --> 01:24:34.222]  It's a poisonous culture.
[01:24:35.082 --> 01:24:36.683]  It's inviting on the surface.
[01:24:37.444 --> 01:24:41.267]  But it's the death of who we are.
[01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:48.009]  It's simulated combat, it's simulated sex, all of it.
[01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:50.530]  It's Matrix Mind Control.
[01:24:52.851 --> 01:24:59.013]  And to sit there and ease back into a game and let myself be part of it, it's sick.
[01:24:59.773 --> 01:25:03.494]  People would sell it as well, you gotta have some time off, you gotta enjoy yourself.
[01:25:05.626 --> 01:25:15.208]  How about enjoying myself instructing my children, enjoying myself hunting or fishing, or enjoying myself doing something human, not some... Anything the New World Order is selling is poison.
[01:25:16.249 --> 01:25:19.369]  Anything they're pushing, you better believe is bad for you.
[01:25:20.110 --> 01:25:22.150]  They've given themselves totally over to it.
[01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:23.390]  You have to understand that.
[01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:25.731]  They are about being purist.
[01:25:26.671 --> 01:25:30.132]  They are perfectionist in their dark designs.
[01:25:35.251 --> 01:25:39.434]  And when you're awake, the propaganda is everywhere.
[01:25:40.655 --> 01:25:44.938]  And it is unmistakably converting our society into a nightmare system.
[01:25:50.081 --> 01:25:52.323]  Mark and North Carolina are on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:25:53.864 --> 01:25:56.445]  Alex, I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!
[01:25:56.966 --> 01:25:59.587]  Good, I know I'm ranting today, is it making sense?
[01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:01.469]  Nah, it makes sense to me.
[01:26:01.869 --> 01:26:03.370]  I'll tell you what it's got me ticked off.
[01:26:03.982 --> 01:26:18.615]  I try to go get my 401k and convert it to precious metals and come to find out that my wife's Medicare and her Social Security earned from her disability, she will lose it.
[01:26:18.635 --> 01:26:30.405]  I couldn't understand the way the accountant put it, but... You know, they've got it set up that if you leave your money with the bankers so they can steal it through inflation and other things, or then they'll get rid of the quote other benefits.
[01:26:30.705 --> 01:26:31.566]  It's always a trap.
[01:26:32.568 --> 01:26:33.288]  That's it.
[01:26:33.308 --> 01:26:34.489]  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[01:26:34.509 --> 01:26:36.589]  But I've got something that really ticked me off.
[01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:37.970]  I'm watching the debate the other night.
[01:26:38.090 --> 01:26:40.410]  Ron Paul's up there and they're badgering him.
[01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:41.931]  They're talking about Oklahoma City.
[01:26:42.591 --> 01:26:44.272]  And I'm sure you watched as well.
[01:26:44.772 --> 01:26:49.273]  But Newt Gingrich speaks up and turns around and says, eh, see?
[01:26:49.853 --> 01:26:51.074]  But they were talking about the result.
[01:26:51.734 --> 01:26:52.494]  Talking about McVeigh.
[01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:58.236]  I'm just curious as why didn't Ron take the opportunity to turn around and say that McVeigh wasn't the only one there.
[01:26:59.474 --> 01:27:02.179]  I know Ron knows about all this, a lot more than we do.
[01:27:10.424 --> 01:27:15.227]  Here's the New York Times a few days ago before the anniversary of the Kennedy assassination.
[01:27:15.948 --> 01:27:17.729]  What killed JFK?
[01:27:18.129 --> 01:27:19.110]  Not who, but what?
[01:27:19.811 --> 01:27:26.575]  And then it was basically right-wing hatred killed him, and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
[01:27:27.256 --> 01:27:28.277]  And then it continues.
[01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:29.377]  Fox News.
[01:27:29.437 --> 01:27:32.539]  Historians claim new research shows Oswald acted alone.
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:34.181]  It's just totally made up.
[01:27:34.801 --> 01:27:40.825]  And then judge orders psychological tests for alleged White House shooter, and they try to blame the Obama deception for this guy doing this.
[01:27:43.126 --> 01:27:45.688]  They're trying, and yes, I did see it.
[01:27:46.228 --> 01:27:50.251]  They're trying to imply that this Republican's doing this.
[01:27:52.057 --> 01:27:58.840]  Anti-government criticism of the New World Order basically caused Oklahoma City and they're trying to imply Ron Paul's involved in it.
[01:27:59.281 --> 01:28:05.083]  They all know that the internal Homeland Security reports are all about Ron Paul and Alex Jones and people that are awake.
[01:28:05.564 --> 01:28:08.505]  Because we're the real Americans and they're the traitors that want global government.
[01:28:09.366 --> 01:28:13.408]  And so yes, I'm going to try to get to those highlights here in just a moment.
[01:28:13.448 --> 01:28:14.128]  What's your take on it?
[01:28:14.909 --> 01:28:17.650]  Well, my take on it is I'm doing what I can do here.
[01:28:18.090 --> 01:28:25.092]  I'm not far from Fort Bragg and I've got my awards signed and shirts and I go out to Walmart and I see the troops and I talk to them.
[01:28:25.152 --> 01:28:28.213]  I've got my son-in-laws over in Afghanistan right now fighting for this country.
[01:28:28.613 --> 01:28:31.134]  I did my time in the Air Force and my dad was in the Navy.
[01:28:31.774 --> 01:28:33.314]  My family's been in the military.
[01:28:33.815 --> 01:28:34.555]  We've done our time.
[01:28:34.595 --> 01:28:35.375]  We support each other.
[01:28:35.655 --> 01:28:36.355]  I put it this way.
[01:28:36.575 --> 01:28:38.696]  I love my country, but I hate my government.
[01:28:39.039 --> 01:28:42.881]  Well, that's what George Washington would say, and we've got so many good people in the military.
[01:28:42.941 --> 01:28:51.605]  Look at how, just like last time, 70-plus percent of all military donations, Republican and Democrat, in the presidential race go to Ron Paul.
[01:28:52.105 --> 01:28:58.828]  So the military's good, and they're trying to hire the gangbangers, they're trying to hire the illegals and all the rest of it, but it's not working.
[01:28:59.548 --> 01:29:00.749]  And that's what's holding them back.
[01:29:01.089 --> 01:29:15.180]  That's why they're shifting to this new domestic security force that doesn't even go through constitutional training like police, this new federal goon force of the TSA, who think it's their right to rape women, including 14-year-old girls, reportedly.
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.243]  I mean, every day I hear about them being arrested for rape or pedophilia.
[01:29:19.523 --> 01:29:22.686]  Who do you think wants to grab people's genitals all day?
[01:29:23.786 --> 01:29:25.427]  I mean, there's your answer right there, Mark, right?
[01:29:25.827 --> 01:29:26.927]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:29:26.947 --> 01:29:32.169]  We just got to get out there and talk to more police officers and sheriffs and let them, help them see the light.
[01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:32.849]  That's right.
[01:29:32.929 --> 01:29:37.471]  America has been hijacked by the banksters who are using high-tech brainwashing.
[01:29:37.731 --> 01:29:39.391]  Folks, break the brainwashing.
[01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:40.932]  Choose the right side.
[01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:43.052]  Stand with George Washington.
[01:29:43.333 --> 01:29:44.373]  It's that simple.
[01:29:50.305 --> 01:29:53.289]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.231 --> 01:29:56.914]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:05.279 --> 01:30:06.180]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:10.022]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:10.403 --> 01:30:12.704]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.864 --> 01:30:18.128]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:18.568 --> 01:30:24.813]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:25.233 --> 01:30:30.797]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:31.197 --> 01:30:34.880]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:39.362]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.662 --> 01:30:45.606]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:45.626 --> 01:30:48.587]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:49.167 --> 01:30:50.588]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:51.149 --> 01:30:51.629]  It's here.

[01:31:08.121 --> 01:31:12.903]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:13.263 --> 01:31:20.046]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:31:21.987 --> 01:31:24.167]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:31:26.068 --> 01:31:28.349]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:31:30.356 --> 01:31:34.379]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:31:35.099 --> 01:31:38.201]  Blue Diamond Gussets, got it.
[01:31:38.922 --> 01:31:39.722]  Others don't.
[01:31:40.143 --> 01:31:42.044]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:31:42.304 --> 01:31:43.805]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:31:44.085 --> 01:31:46.647]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:31:46.967 --> 01:31:53.211]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[01:31:56.293 --> 01:31:58.335]  Diamond Gusset Jeans, got it.
[01:31:58.675 --> 01:31:59.536]  Others don't.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:04.883]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.203 --> 01:32:05.824]  Number one.
[01:32:06.124 --> 01:32:09.286]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.546 --> 01:32:10.107]  Number two.
[01:32:10.407 --> 01:32:14.950]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:15.750]  It's true.
[01:32:16.051 --> 01:32:20.594]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.914 --> 01:32:21.434]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.735 --> 01:32:25.017]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.317 --> 01:32:29.040]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:29.780]  Number 4.
[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:32.402]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.782 --> 01:32:36.125]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.465 --> 01:32:41.167]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.407 --> 01:32:46.168]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.448 --> 01:32:50.470]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:33:02.356 --> 01:33:03.016]  Eat your eggs!
[01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:03.957]  Let's change from the prison planet!
[01:33:03.977 --> 01:33:04.117]  Get up!
[01:33:04.137 --> 01:33:04.417]  Eat your eggs!
[01:33:04.437 --> 01:33:05.658]  Let's change from the prison planet!
[01:33:05.678 --> 01:33:28.131]  Planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet, planet,
[01:33:31.457 --> 01:33:36.559]  Okay ladies and gentlemen, this is like 15 minutes long because it's got the responses and the other candidates in there.
[01:33:37.079 --> 01:33:45.703]  So I'll play about 5-6 minutes of it now, talk to Richard Rees for a little while, take some of your phone calls, then play another clip when Bob Chapman's on with us so I can comment on it.
[01:33:46.563 --> 01:33:53.746]  But here is some of the debate, and now that it's become such a controversy that Ron Paul got 89 seconds in the
[01:33:55.493 --> 01:33:55.874]  I don't
[01:34:17.475 --> 01:34:21.679]  has written the foreword to two books calling for an end to American sovereignty.
[01:34:22.039 --> 01:34:23.280]  He wants carbon taxes.
[01:34:23.921 --> 01:34:35.271]  We're going to get to George, Sean, Steve, and others here in just a few minutes as well, but let's go ahead and play part of the debate, the CNN debate, a couple nights ago.
[01:34:35.311 --> 01:34:35.571]  Here it is.
[01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:38.713]  I'm Ron Paul, a congressman from Texas.
[01:34:39.693 --> 01:34:43.516]  I am pleased to be here to debate because this is a very important debate.
[01:34:44.116 --> 01:34:47.819]  I am convinced that needless and unnecessary wars are a great detriment.
[01:34:48.259 --> 01:34:50.580]  They undermine our prosperity and our liberties.
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:53.362]  They add to our deficits and they consume our welfare.
[01:34:53.442 --> 01:34:56.564]  We should take a careful look at our foreign policy.
[01:35:00.829 --> 01:35:08.413]  Our lead-off question is from the Honorable Ed Meese, the former Attorney General of the United States, who's representing the Heritage Foundation.
[01:35:10.314 --> 01:35:16.416]  At least 42 terrorist attacks aimed at the United States have been thwarted since 9-11.
[01:35:18.089 --> 01:35:23.251]  Tools like the Patriot Act have been instrumental in finding and stopping terrorists.
[01:35:24.071 --> 01:35:29.353]  Shouldn't we have a long-range extension of the investigative powers contained in that act?
[01:35:29.513 --> 01:35:29.933]  Total bull.
[01:35:29.953 --> 01:35:32.114]  So that our law enforcement officers can have the tools.
[01:35:32.134 --> 01:35:33.194]  Why didn't we have this before?
[01:35:33.214 --> 01:35:35.495]  Paul, I suspect you disagree.
[01:35:36.175 --> 01:35:36.455]  I do.
[01:35:37.076 --> 01:35:37.536]  Tell us why.
[01:35:40.061 --> 01:35:45.287]  I think the patriarchy is unpatriotic because it undermines our liberty.
[01:35:45.707 --> 01:35:48.711]  I'm concerned, as everybody is, about the terrorist attack.
[01:35:48.931 --> 01:35:51.073]  Timothy McVeigh was a vicious terrorist.
[01:35:51.394 --> 01:35:52.174]  He was arrested.
[01:35:52.235 --> 01:35:57.961]  Terrorism, still on the books, internationally and nationally, is a criminal, is a crime, and we should deal with it.
[01:35:58.321 --> 01:36:00.544]  We dealt with it rather well with Timothy McVeigh.
[01:36:01.584 --> 01:36:09.225]  Why I really fear it is we have drifted into a condition that we were warned against because our early founders were very clear.
[01:36:09.285 --> 01:36:12.946]  They said, don't be willing to sacrifice liberty for security.
[01:36:13.006 --> 01:36:21.328]  Today, it seems too easy that our government and our Congresses are so willing to give up our liberties for our security.
[01:36:21.768 --> 01:36:26.609]  I have a personal belief that you never have to give up liberty for security.
[01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:29.109]  You can still provide security without
[01:36:29.309 --> 01:36:35.532]  He got a better chance of dying as I've broken down a million times from honeybee stings than terrorism.
[01:36:35.552 --> 01:36:39.274]  I mean, it's just the way they sap it, the way they push the fear.
[01:36:39.314 --> 01:36:45.937]  And this is one of Ron Paul's only points I disagree with.
[01:36:58.396 --> 01:36:59.256]  Ron Paul's not stupid.
[01:36:59.296 --> 01:37:01.938]  He knows there's the newscast of the bombs being removed at Oklahoma City.
[01:37:01.978 --> 01:37:06.320]  He knows about the Southern Poverty Law Center running the Elohim City compound.
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:07.620]  That's all out there.
[01:37:08.981 --> 01:37:12.783]  And so Ron Paul always goes with this line about, you know, just arrest Bin Laden or whatever.
[01:37:14.123 --> 01:37:16.824]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've put Al-Qaeda in charge of Libya now.
[01:37:17.625 --> 01:37:19.746]  The government got the underwear bomber on the plane.
[01:37:21.607 --> 01:37:24.748]  But see, it's seen as baggage to be for 9-11 truth.
[01:37:25.428 --> 01:37:26.269]  To face reality.
[01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:32.192]  And so it allows them to play these games, where torture will keep us safe.
[01:37:32.232 --> 01:37:32.452]  Really?
[01:37:32.732 --> 01:37:35.533]  What about keeping us safe from a government that can arrest anybody they want?
[01:37:38.494 --> 01:37:51.858]  Continuing here... By the way, Jeremy was just pointing out in my ear, you notice out of all the candidates, whatever, eight of them that are up there, during that comment by Ron Paul, they have Ginrich already in the split screen.
[01:37:52.659 --> 01:37:55.880]  It's all pre-set up, and then they go to Ginrich for a response.
[01:37:56.886 --> 01:37:58.326]  It's all planned to get Gingrich.
[01:37:58.586 --> 01:37:59.887]  Like, ooh, he's smart.
[01:38:00.227 --> 01:38:02.107]  Ooh, he has these pre-scripted things.
[01:38:02.527 --> 01:38:04.608]  We're going to ask Ron Paul about McVeigh.
[01:38:04.968 --> 01:38:05.948]  Ron Paul's going to respond.
[01:38:05.968 --> 01:38:07.028]  We know how he's going to respond.
[01:38:07.968 --> 01:38:10.849]  And then we're going to have Newt Gingrich respond.
[01:38:10.869 --> 01:38:13.690]  I mean, it's all ridiculous.
[01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:17.310]  150-something people die, so America, the Bill of Rights Constitution has to die.
[01:38:17.591 --> 01:38:23.912]  I mean, it's in the news today that the government wants to pass a law where they can kill or arrest citizens anytime they want.
[01:38:25.964 --> 01:38:27.225]  It's just, you get rid of it all!
[01:38:28.265 --> 01:38:30.286]  Let's go back to a little bit more, then we'll go to Richard Reeves.
[01:38:30.806 --> 01:38:31.507]  Uh, here's more of it.
[01:38:32.027 --> 01:38:33.828]  They killed a lot of Americans!
[01:38:34.068 --> 01:38:34.488]  Oh no!
[01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:39.871]  I don't want a law that says, after we lose a major American city, we're sure gonna come and find you.
[01:38:40.411 --> 01:38:44.353]  I want a law that says, you try to take out an American city, we're gonna stop you!
[01:38:44.373 --> 01:38:44.833]  Alright, pause.
[01:38:45.954 --> 01:38:47.835]  Oh, you try to take out an American city?
[01:38:47.875 --> 01:38:50.796]  America's been conquered by the banksters that you work for.
[01:38:51.277 --> 01:38:54.038]  The new Bank of the World Goldman Sachs system, the global government.
[01:38:55.848 --> 01:38:59.069]  Remember Dick Cheney when he was getting grilled on national TV, what was it, Meet the Press?
[01:38:59.449 --> 01:39:01.130]  About a real 9-11 investigation?
[01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:06.552]  He said, you do that, you're gonna distract us from keeping you safe, and a major city will be nuked.
[01:39:06.852 --> 01:39:07.493]  Is that understood?
[01:39:07.513 --> 01:39:09.353]  Yeah, we know you'll nuke a major city.
[01:39:11.574 --> 01:39:15.536]  Al-Qaeda, who they've now given thousands and thousands of shoulder-launched missiles.
[01:39:15.996 --> 01:39:22.919]  And they know the public's so dumb, they'll blow up some planes and say Al-Qaeda did it, and take our rights, and no one will say, why'd you give them missiles?
[01:39:24.838 --> 01:39:35.049]  We'll probably be in Libya, and I say we, that is we being drugged by our hair by the globalists, in Libya, in two years to quote, take out Al Qaeda.
[01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:40.454]  Like they're already in the news saying they gotta go into other countries in Africa to kick out Al Qaeda, which they put in power.
[01:39:43.157 --> 01:39:46.381]  Newt Gingrich, Mr. Carbon Taxes.
[01:39:48.177 --> 01:39:57.922]  I mean, he's like Mitt Romney, who wants open borders, gun control, abortion, carbon taxes, wrote Obamacare, and the Republicans love him, because they're idiots!
[01:39:59.363 --> 01:40:10.829]  Let's play a little bit more of that monster, Newt Gingrich, who divorced his wife while she was dying of cancer.
[01:40:14.005 --> 01:40:17.288]  These are sociopaths that are all about themselves.
[01:40:17.328 --> 01:40:17.988]  Let's go back to it.
[01:40:18.008 --> 01:40:22.792]  I mean, look at him.
[01:40:23.032 --> 01:40:30.978]  This is like saying that we need a policeman in every house, a camera in every house because we want to prevent child beating and wife beating.
[01:40:31.238 --> 01:40:35.121]  You can prevent crimes by becoming a police state.
[01:40:35.341 --> 01:40:37.323]  So if you advocate the police state, yes, you're going
[01:40:37.423 --> 01:40:37.903]  So effeminate.
[01:40:56.974 --> 01:40:57.654]  Yeah, hit pause.
[01:40:58.074 --> 01:40:58.595]  Hit pause.
[01:40:58.615 --> 01:41:00.535]  I'm going to get to more of that next hour with Bob Chapman.
[01:41:01.256 --> 01:41:03.476]  But I want to get to your calls here, at least those that have been holding.
[01:41:04.237 --> 01:41:05.477]  Richard Reeves came in today.
[01:41:05.497 --> 01:41:07.338]  We just got back from our trip around the country.
[01:41:07.658 --> 01:41:12.620]  Hey Richard, do you know where the newspaper is where it says Girls Night Out, all female police checkpoints?
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.521]  I think it is somewhere on the vehicle somewhere.
[01:41:17.541 --> 01:41:19.402]  I'll have to track it down, but I remember seeing that paper.
[01:41:19.422 --> 01:41:21.983]  Because I thought I hauled it off and then I couldn't find it.
[01:41:22.580 --> 01:41:23.460]  I think I've got it somewhere.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.141]  I don't even want to cover this stuff until I get it all together.
[01:41:26.501 --> 01:41:30.603]  Of course, I have the little activity books they give all the kids about how to spy on your parents.
[01:41:30.623 --> 01:41:32.003]  That's nice at the National Parks.
[01:41:32.383 --> 01:41:33.624]  Well, that is nice.
[01:41:34.384 --> 01:41:36.345]  They find every way they can to encroach on us.
[01:41:36.425 --> 01:41:37.825]  Well, the state knows best, Richard.
[01:41:38.945 --> 01:41:42.146]  Now, I've got a document cam shot over here of a printout.
[01:41:42.567 --> 01:41:46.868]  This is the two-sided, one-sheet, Ron Paul 2012 color printout.
[01:41:47.288 --> 01:41:49.369]  I am the champion of the Constitution, Ron Paul.
[01:41:50.533 --> 01:41:52.194]  And it breaks down where he stands.
[01:41:52.234 --> 01:41:55.676]  They want to get this out to all Iowa voters.
[01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:57.177]  Now, we're not going to just talk about this.
[01:41:57.197 --> 01:42:02.520]  We're going to talk about some other Ron Paul strategy, even a big activist and a delegate and all the rest of it, Richard.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:06.462]  But we are trying to get this out to everybody right now.
[01:42:06.542 --> 01:42:13.246]  So we're seeing him in first or second place in scientific polls, and the media is having to admit now he is a top-tier candidate.
[01:42:13.526 --> 01:42:15.247]  So their hoax is really starting to break.
[01:42:15.587 --> 01:42:18.829]  Now they're moving into the attack mode with these set-ups with Genrich and people.
[01:42:19.409 --> 01:42:24.376]  Well, thanks to all the grassroots activists out there, that's why the polls are going so well for them.
[01:42:24.416 --> 01:42:31.586]  As a matter of fact, they're so scared of some of these straw polls, for example, here in Texas, they even cancelled the Texas straw poll earlier this year.
[01:42:32.067 --> 01:42:36.173]  Normally, in September or August, they do a straw poll in Texas for the presidential
[01:42:36.633 --> 01:42:37.314]  I don't know.
[01:42:52.876 --> 01:42:53.437]  The reverse.
[01:42:53.757 --> 01:42:54.698]  It's from the bottom up.
[01:42:55.038 --> 01:42:57.580]  We saw that with the creation of the real Tea Party.
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.103]  The origins of the Tea Party were Ron Paul revolutionaries.
[01:43:02.544 --> 01:43:06.267]  We had the past money bombs like, remember, remember, the 5th of November.
[01:43:06.327 --> 01:43:13.793]  Remember how the news media tried to spin that, oh it was all about a violent thing or whatever, when it was just kind of a rallying cry to push everybody forward.
[01:43:14.433 --> 01:43:25.440]  And all the different money bombs that the volunteers have coordinated and put together and the past meet-up groups that they've done over the years, the meet-up groups that organically sprung up.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:31.644]  So this is yet, oh, and I forgot about the Ron Paul blimp back in 2007-2008 election cycle.
[01:43:31.744 --> 01:43:33.845]  Or Ted Anderson in the Ron Paul Air Force.
[01:43:33.905 --> 01:43:34.565]  That's right.
[01:43:34.946 --> 01:43:40.669]  I mean, the grassroots... And again, look how Ron Paul's probably five times bigger this time.
[01:43:40.689 --> 01:43:42.310]  I told people, don't get mad if he loses.
[01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:43.891]  It's fighting that wins.
[01:43:44.271 --> 01:43:46.092]  Now people have heard about liberty.
[01:43:46.132 --> 01:43:56.518]  Now the hottest movement on campuses, and this is an upset Vildenberg group from Tucker's sources that are impeccable, is that it's not communism or mainline fake right-wing stuff that's popular.
[01:43:56.618 --> 01:43:57.219]  It's liberty.
[01:43:58.484 --> 01:44:00.105]  It's anti-big state ideas.
[01:44:00.585 --> 01:44:01.966]  It's Atlas Shrugged type stuff.
[01:44:02.026 --> 01:44:03.706]  The system is scared.
[01:44:04.467 --> 01:44:11.890]  Well, they should be scared because, like I said, all these other campaigns that you look at, you don't see any grassroots real fervor to them or whatever.
[01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:24.495]  And the Ron Paul campaign is the only one that I've been able to discern and identify that does have that grassroots fervor where people get together, they get their websites together, they get their coalitions together, and they themselves take action.
[01:44:24.535 --> 01:44:25.355]  And that's what really
[01:44:25.835 --> 01:44:25.895]  Yes.
[01:44:56.276 --> 01:45:00.400]  Iowa is especially a key place because that is a caucus state.
[01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:09.689]  And what that means is people literally physically show up to have their bodies and their hands counted as to how they're going to vote in presidential primary.
[01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:10.510]  That's how they vote.
[01:45:10.530 --> 01:45:12.853]  It's kind of like a convention-type process.
[01:45:13.173 --> 01:45:18.599]  And so these things, I know this is just the day after Turkey Day and people are probably still hungover from the UT
[01:45:19.199 --> 01:45:38.819]  A&M game and I know you I heard you on the show talking earlier how they had a photo finish and everything on that game and I didn't even know until I heard you talking about the game so that's how unplugged I am from football but folks the time to start thinking about well I mean it'd be fine to be plugged into football we had our Constitution but I mean literally now MF Globals three billion missing
[01:45:39.502 --> 01:45:39.702]  Really?
[01:45:39.722 --> 01:45:41.043]  And they're just saying you're not getting your money.
[01:45:41.383 --> 01:45:46.606]  And MF Global was such a small outfit that prior to you and Gerald Cilente talking about it, I'd never even heard of it.
[01:45:46.986 --> 01:45:53.850]  Imagine if we see vanguards and fidelities and outfits that are almost household words going down the tubes like that.
[01:45:54.190 --> 01:45:56.011]  Well, that's what the derivatives are going to do.
[01:45:56.592 --> 01:45:58.773]  And at each stage, we're going to give the bankers everything.
[01:45:58.833 --> 01:46:00.114]  Okay, here's 10 trillion more.
[01:46:00.394 --> 01:46:01.574]  Just save my pension fund.
[01:46:01.835 --> 01:46:04.276]  But if you look at it in the aggregate, they're going to steal it all slowly.
[01:46:04.776 --> 01:46:07.358]  First, they cut, you know, half the salami and you keep half.
[01:46:08.168 --> 01:46:14.811]  When they say, give us half again, give us half again, pretty soon you're down to one slice, and you're going, okay, bankers saved me.
[01:46:14.831 --> 01:46:22.514]  And I'm like, okay, you get half a slice, then quarter slice, and then a tenth of a slice, and then a tenth of a tenth of a slice, until it's the size of an atom.
[01:46:23.795 --> 01:46:26.276]  And you're like, thank you, bankers, for my one atom of salami.
[01:46:27.546 --> 01:46:27.826]  Right.
[01:46:27.906 --> 01:46:30.029]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible!
[01:46:30.269 --> 01:46:40.140]  I mean, I've got a stack of news, mainstream saying, the world is now ruled by Goldman Sachs, they control the countries, there's no more freedom in Europe, and they're raising taxes on everyone, and that's the way it is.
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:48.949]  And you just pointed out that in Europe, that's where to look at to see where they're trying to make us go, because in Europe they are really cracking down on
[01:46:49.890 --> 01:46:51.831]  The austerity and putting people out.
[01:46:51.871 --> 01:46:53.652]  Oh, it's all coming here, folks.
[01:46:53.692 --> 01:46:54.753]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:46:54.773 --> 01:46:57.254]  But getting back to Ron Paul, tell us about this mailer.
[01:46:57.634 --> 01:47:14.063]  Because this is, you know, my cousin is here in town and he's in Illinois working and he told me, he said he is doing the phone bank stuff where they give him the numbers and he calls people and, you know, basically asks them questions about the election to get them talking and then brings up Ron Paul and his real issues, which is very effective in Iowa and other key states.
[01:47:14.383 --> 01:47:16.204]  He's talking about physically going to Iowa.
[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:24.223]  Well, and that's what happened last election cycle is a lot of folks did go to Iowa and I predict that this year even more folks will go to Iowa.
[01:47:24.343 --> 01:47:26.244]  We had people from Texas going up to Iowa.
[01:47:26.264 --> 01:47:30.385]  We had people from Texas going up to New Hampshire and working as volunteers up there.
[01:47:30.485 --> 01:47:39.769]  So that's the type of grassroots thing that's going on with the Ron Paul campaign last election and this election that other campaigns really don't have.
[01:47:40.209 --> 01:47:46.833]  Unless they pay big, big, big dollars to all these people to go, which the Ron Paul campaign obviously is not going to have.
[01:47:47.253 --> 01:47:58.179]  But what a lot of Ron Paul activists have done, similar to a Ted Anderson effort, a Ron Paul blimp type effort, is they've put together a great brochure to try to break through the media Berlin Wall.
[01:47:58.539 --> 01:48:03.562]  And their plan is to get those mailed to every Republican, what they call a super voter,
[01:48:04.062 --> 01:48:14.445]  Regular primary voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, they want to mail those out to those targeted primary, past primary voters, and also independent primary voters.
[01:48:14.705 --> 01:48:21.626]  So those are key voters that are going to get these mailers, and they're just at the rock bottom, just cost price.
[01:48:21.986 --> 01:48:27.148]  If you go to that RonPaulProducts.com, RonPaulProducts.com... Is this an official Ron Paul thing?
[01:48:27.328 --> 01:48:27.488]  Right.
[01:48:29.128 --> 01:48:51.667]  Sanctioned by all the, it's an affiliated of like the DailyPaul.com, RonPaulForums.com, all of these groups that are Ron Paul affiliated websites are together on this effort and that's how you can find, as a matter of fact, the way you can do it is you can drill down to where you can go to a specific county in Iowa and you can fund that effort of getting those
[01:48:52.287 --> 01:48:52.667]  We're good to go.
[01:49:14.637 --> 01:49:15.297]  I don't
[01:49:37.202 --> 01:50:00.790]  All these affiliated Ron Paul websites, and as you can see, I showed you on the brochure, they've got the Ron Paul 2012, the official website for Ron Paul, and the Daily Paul and the Ron Paul Forums websites on there, and they fact checked and checked all the data on these brochures, they've carefully gone through them to make them as powerful as they could, and as precise as they could, and as exacting as they could.
[01:50:00.870 --> 01:50:02.871]  So, you can go to the website,
[01:50:03.571 --> 01:50:06.315]  And you can have a look at the brochure for yourself.
[01:50:06.816 --> 01:50:12.042]  And they've also set it up to where you can purchase these and pass out in your own precincts in your own state.
[01:50:12.343 --> 01:50:13.284]  But that's another story.
[01:50:13.364 --> 01:50:21.415]  And regardless, even if Ron Paul doesn't win, which he has a really good chance to, even with all of the election fraud, you're educating people about liberty.
[01:50:21.795 --> 01:50:30.024]  You're educating them about what the Constitution is, not what a bunch of Republican pro-torture, war-mongering, carbon-tax-loving people are saying.
[01:50:30.284 --> 01:50:34.029]  Not what a bunch of, you know, banker-funded, New World War-funded Obama people.
[01:50:34.289 --> 01:50:39.294]  I mean, what about the idiot Occupy Wall Street subgroup protesting Ron Paul?
[01:50:39.955 --> 01:50:43.438]  I mean, I mean, these people are just absolute idgits.
[01:50:43.678 --> 01:50:46.260]  Those guys have pretty much succeeded in demonizing the First Amendment.
[01:50:46.300 --> 01:50:58.910]  I was listening to talk radio today, all the way from Fort Worth, Dallas, down to Austin, and pretty much the two radio stations, 570 and 590, I heard, they're all talking about, hey, you know, forget about First Amendment, let's just charge these guys for what they're doing.
[01:50:59.010 --> 01:50:59.530]  It's incredible.
[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:00.091]  Thank you, Richard.
[01:51:00.511 --> 01:51:00.831]  Thank you.

[01:56:00.368 --> 01:56:02.329]  George in Florida, thanks for holding.
[01:56:03.749 --> 01:56:05.210]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:06.710]  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.
[01:56:07.610 --> 01:56:08.190]  It was all right.
[01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.911]  It was pretty good.
[01:56:09.151 --> 01:56:09.631]  Thanks for asking.
[01:56:09.651 --> 01:56:10.431]  I hope you did as well.
[01:56:11.175 --> 01:56:12.015]  Yeah, I did as well.
[01:56:12.055 --> 01:56:14.216]  Hey, Ben, listen, more to the point here.
[01:56:14.937 --> 01:56:16.457]  You were talking about Ron Paul.
[01:56:17.018 --> 01:56:28.903]  I am a lifelong Republican, you know, and basically my friends told me back in 2008 that Ron Paul, I should have voted for Ron Paul.
[01:56:29.123 --> 01:56:30.884]  I ignored him and regretted it.
[01:56:31.785 --> 01:56:40.169]  And I'll tell you what, I was, and I use this word very carefully here, but I was really in fear when I heard Newt Gingrich
[01:56:45.217 --> 01:57:06.057]  One that, you know, the Bill of Rights and the Constitution only applies to like, you know, stealing and, you know, robbery and theft and murder, but, you know, terrorism is a totally different animal, and... Because they now, under Patriot Act, are charging people for marijuana with it, and waiving their Bill of Rights and Constitution, and I have, even the ACLU out today,
[01:57:07.705 --> 01:57:14.191]  Senators demand Americans be locked up for any reason, and the battlefield is considered your streets anywhere.
[01:57:15.151 --> 01:57:18.074]  Anybody can be arrested without trial by the Army.
[01:57:18.354 --> 01:57:22.798]  Well, the Army admits they're preparing to, quote, pull triggers on the American people.
[01:57:22.858 --> 01:57:25.700]  That was in Stars and Stripes three years ago.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:26.181]  Remember that?
[01:57:27.025 --> 01:57:27.985]  Yeah, yeah, I sure do.
[01:57:28.366 --> 01:57:35.829]  And the thing about it, Alex, is, you know, anything that I could fault Ron Paul on is he actually understates the threat.
[01:57:35.969 --> 01:57:46.354]  He really, and I know he's not pulling punches and he's real polite and everything, but he, I mean, this is not meant to say, you know, I'm going to support him no matter what.
[01:57:46.474 --> 01:57:51.696]  I mean, this, but the only other point that I was going to move on to was about the banking system.
[01:57:52.056 --> 01:57:56.398]  I have a graduate degree in finance, and one of the things they teach you, Alex, and
[01:57:59.104 --> 01:57:59.684]  I don't know.
[01:57:59.784 --> 01:58:00.665]  I don't know.
[01:58:26.175 --> 01:58:27.375]  They told me not to go there.
[01:58:27.635 --> 01:58:29.196]  They told me not to talk about it.
[01:58:29.736 --> 01:58:32.457]  They told me not to leave it alone.
[01:58:32.677 --> 01:58:33.177]  Exactly.
[01:58:33.217 --> 01:58:33.597]  Stay there.
[01:58:33.617 --> 01:58:34.397]  I want to come back to you.
[01:58:34.717 --> 01:58:38.178]  They told you not to stay in the matrix, to stay in the bubble.
[01:58:38.418 --> 01:58:39.579]  Don't get outside the box.
[01:58:41.679 --> 01:58:43.200]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:53.886 --> 01:58:58.908]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:58:59.189 --> 01:59:00.549]  Saving means to make money.

[01:59:10.234 --> 01:59:17.355]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:17.776 --> 01:59:25.397]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:59:25.777 --> 01:59:30.698]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:59:56.486 --> 01:59:59.247]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:09.947]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.587 --> 02:00:11.408]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.188 --> 02:00:13.109]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.729 --> 02:00:17.351]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.931 --> 02:00:22.033]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.614 --> 02:00:27.916]  We're going to get to Sean here in a moment.
[02:00:28.933 --> 02:00:30.454]  First, we've got to get to Steve and others.
[02:00:31.134 --> 02:00:34.496]  We'll take calls while Bob Chapman's on with us, breaking down all the big developments in the economy.
[02:00:35.416 --> 02:00:40.439]  MF Global, the Euro, the open announcement of Bank of the World, what that means, what the next phase will be.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.141]  Finishing up with George in Florida.
[02:00:43.161 --> 02:00:48.524]  He was getting his graduate degree in finance, and I've talked to people who've done this, and the same thing happens.
[02:00:49.104 --> 02:00:52.526]  In fact, they have specialized schools if you get into upper management.
[02:00:53.146 --> 02:00:59.371]  Where you then go to private groups, even above the School of Economics in London, where you're then taught how things really work.
[02:01:00.012 --> 02:01:01.053]  And it's all very simple.
[02:01:01.093 --> 02:01:03.175]  It's all hidden in plain view, but you're just not told about it.
[02:01:03.775 --> 02:01:13.543]  And so George was saying he brought up the big mega central banks, how they control it all, how there was a level above what was being taught, and he was called aside and told.
[02:01:14.384 --> 02:01:15.225]  Do not go there.
[02:01:15.925 --> 02:01:16.886]  Do not bring this up.
[02:01:16.906 --> 02:01:24.912]  See, when you break through, like in the Truman Show, and go, whoa, you mean I'm in a controlled, limited reality and artificial habitat?
[02:01:25.733 --> 02:01:26.613]  And then that's what it is.
[02:01:26.693 --> 02:01:32.097]  It's like, aren't you into the... I was on the trip and we went on a horseback ride and the guy was real nice.
[02:01:33.398 --> 02:01:36.741]  But he was like, how about them cowboys?
[02:01:36.761 --> 02:01:37.361]  You like the cowboys?
[02:01:37.441 --> 02:01:38.082]  I said, not really.
[02:01:38.102 --> 02:01:39.303]  And he went, oh man, I'm a big fan.
[02:01:39.343 --> 02:01:39.543]  Wow.
[02:01:41.587 --> 02:01:45.049]  And I said, it's not that I dislike the Cowboys, it's that I've broken with it.
[02:01:46.509 --> 02:01:49.471]  I can't get excited about something that's meant to be a distraction.
[02:01:49.491 --> 02:01:50.351]  Do you understand that?
[02:01:50.811 --> 02:01:52.292]  And he didn't understand.
[02:01:52.312 --> 02:02:02.757]  I mean, when you figure out that your life is not your own and it's controlled and false, and you see the authoritarianism growing by design, you want to stop it!
[02:02:04.608 --> 02:02:07.190]  And now they're just like, yeah, let's get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:09.752]  Just five years ago, they'd be like, we're not getting rid of that.
[02:02:10.072 --> 02:02:11.673]  Now it's like, yeah, we are getting rid of it.
[02:02:12.194 --> 02:02:12.994]  It's bad.
[02:02:14.356 --> 02:02:17.298]  You see videos of cops going, I don't want to hear about the Constitution.
[02:02:17.358 --> 02:02:18.138]  Taser, bzzz.
[02:02:18.639 --> 02:02:19.479]  Judges saying it.
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:23.783]  Judges ruling the Constitution is not admissible in this courtroom.
[02:02:24.083 --> 02:02:25.224]  I mean, these are criminals.
[02:02:25.604 --> 02:02:27.085]  People are like, I can't believe they're doing it.
[02:02:27.406 --> 02:02:28.526]  Of course they're doing it.
[02:02:29.207 --> 02:02:30.248]  It's a takeover.
[02:02:30.528 --> 02:02:31.249]  They've got to.
[02:02:33.592 --> 02:02:35.693]  They're all going to prison if they don't.
[02:02:37.014 --> 02:02:37.594]  You got it?
[02:02:37.655 --> 02:02:39.396]  They're not gonna back off.
[02:02:40.176 --> 02:02:41.857]  They're trying to take us down.
[02:02:43.858 --> 02:02:45.619]  We're not playing patty cake here.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:48.501]  Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.
[02:02:48.982 --> 02:02:51.363]  Roll em up, roll em up, put em in the pan.
[02:02:51.743 --> 02:02:55.426]  Mark em and prick em, put a B, put it in the oven for baby and me.
[02:02:55.466 --> 02:02:57.547]  We're not playing nursery rhyme here.
[02:03:01.154 --> 02:03:02.555]  Uh, you can't be told.
[02:03:02.615 --> 02:03:04.135]  You just gotta experience it, some of you.
[02:03:04.255 --> 02:03:05.215]  And don't worry, you will.
[02:03:06.316 --> 02:03:07.456]  And that's when we're gonna win.
[02:03:08.977 --> 02:03:10.717]  George in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:03:10.757 --> 02:03:11.217]  Go ahead.
[02:03:11.237 --> 02:03:14.579]  I know, I'm going back to George.
[02:03:14.599 --> 02:03:15.639]  Go ahead and finish up your point.
[02:03:16.539 --> 02:03:16.879]  Yeah, sure.
[02:03:16.919 --> 02:03:18.000]  I'll finish it up, Alex.
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:23.381]  Basically, the thing that I was going to, like, the thing you talk about is that walking around in a gaze.
[02:03:23.441 --> 02:03:25.282]  And when I talk to my friends, it's
[02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:28.047]  Yes.
[02:03:28.107 --> 02:03:29.828]  I appreciate it, George.
[02:03:29.868 --> 02:03:31.089]  Yeah, people are under a grand delusion.
[02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.769]  Steve in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:03:31.809 --> 02:03:32.610]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:32.910]  Hi.
[02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:35.092]  I've been waiting for two and a half years to talk to you.
[02:03:57.202 --> 02:04:08.028]  I just recently graduated from Mass Communications Journalism School, so I understand all the manipulations of the mass media.
[02:04:08.308 --> 02:04:13.071]  I'm not going to wait on anybody to help me do my job for me.
[02:04:13.091 --> 02:04:15.492]  I know what needs to be done.
[02:04:15.512 --> 02:04:16.733]  I need to be exposed.
[02:04:19.254 --> 02:04:21.935]  I'm trying to get that done, but I'm just me.
[02:04:21.955 --> 02:04:26.178]  Alright, I'll tell you how to get an audience of one million people awake right now.
[02:04:27.312 --> 02:04:31.373]  You want to know how to have an audience of 1,000,000 people a week within one year?
[02:04:34.073 --> 02:04:35.294]  You want to hear, Sean, how to get 1,000,000?
[02:04:35.914 --> 02:04:38.934]  Or no, Stephen Michigan.
[02:04:39.474 --> 02:04:43.675]  Stephen Michigan, you want to know how to get 1,000,000 listeners a week within one year, guaranteed?
[02:04:44.616 --> 02:04:45.036]  Yes, I do.
[02:04:45.056 --> 02:04:46.236]  And I have a question also.
[02:04:46.336 --> 02:04:49.356]  I'm going to finish up with you and then go to Bob Chapman, who we just got on the line.
[02:04:49.376 --> 02:04:51.197]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:51.597]  Stay with us.
[02:05:02.395 --> 02:05:06.019]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:05:06.419 --> 02:05:09.423]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.663 --> 02:05:14.448]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:05:14.468 --> 02:05:20.715]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:05:20.855 --> 02:05:23.098]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:05:23.638 --> 02:05:23.918]  Tim Geithner?
[02:05:23.938 --> 02:05:24.358]  Bernanke?
[02:05:24.438 --> 02:05:25.219]  They're arsonists!
[02:05:25.239 --> 02:05:26.379]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:05:26.399 --> 02:05:28.640]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.526 --> 02:05:49.453]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:05:49.814 --> 02:05:58.924]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:07:00.865 --> 02:07:02.006]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:02.046 --> 02:07:08.709]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:08.969 --> 02:07:11.270]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:11.531 --> 02:07:16.713]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:16.913 --> 02:07:19.675]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:19.955 --> 02:07:22.016]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:22.276 --> 02:07:28.181]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:28.501 --> 02:07:31.704]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:31.884 --> 02:07:37.429]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:38.990]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:40.491]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:40.611 --> 02:07:43.173]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:43.293 --> 02:07:47.337]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:47.517 --> 02:07:49.538]  You can find the video at www.
[02:07:50.499 --> 02:08:08.644]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.264 --> 02:08:12.305]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:14.566 --> 02:08:18.907]  Okay, we will continue with your calls with Bob Chapman, the international forecaster.
[02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:22.754]  We're going to look at the economy, look at MF Global.
[02:08:22.774 --> 02:08:25.056]  We haven't gotten Bob's take since this broke last few weeks.
[02:08:25.497 --> 02:08:29.261]  Since he wasn't with us last Friday, we're gonna go to Bob here in just a moment.
[02:08:30.143 --> 02:08:34.027]  Get into the whole Syria situation with Russia and quote U.S.
[02:08:34.047 --> 02:08:34.428]  The U.S.
[02:08:34.488 --> 02:08:35.028]  is bankster.
[02:08:36.198 --> 02:08:37.979]  Bankster-controlled US ships.
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.441]  Bankster-occupied America ships.
[02:08:41.362 --> 02:08:46.926]  Literally, it's occupied America facing off with the crony Russian system.
[02:08:47.866 --> 02:08:48.787]  Another mafia.
[02:08:49.627 --> 02:08:52.810]  But not as powerful or as sophisticated, therefore not as big a threat.
[02:08:53.850 --> 02:09:02.556]  Over the new peacekeeping bombing that the loving West wants to do in Syria, because they care so much about humanitarian things, of course.
[02:09:03.036 --> 02:09:11.902]  That's why they met in Egypt while they're machine-gunning crowds to talk about the rumors about the Syrians might have abused a butterfly or something.
[02:09:12.503 --> 02:09:19.007]  Just all hypocrisy, just not even a veil of cover-up.
[02:09:19.027 --> 02:09:20.308]  They just do it all out in the open now.
[02:09:21.607 --> 02:09:24.469]  With the hyper-hypocrisy on display.
[02:09:25.530 --> 02:09:38.739]  But Stephen Michigan called in, and Steve was getting into, he's graduated with his RTF communications degree, and he was talking about how he's not going to wait if he wants to reach out to people.
[02:09:38.779 --> 02:09:39.600]  He had a question.
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:47.085]  And I don't know what his question is, I haven't gotten to him yet, but I said, Steve, let me tell you how to have a million viewers a week, right now.
[02:09:47.866 --> 02:09:51.028]  It'll take a year, but you will have a million viewers a week.
[02:09:52.867 --> 02:09:56.129]  A million viewers a week on YouTube.
[02:09:56.869 --> 02:10:11.938]  And I've got hundreds of ideas like this that guaranteed I have beta tested in my brain by testing other systems that I haven't even implemented yet.
[02:10:13.439 --> 02:10:13.799]  Okay?
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:20.903]  Now let me tell you, and I've already tested this idea out and not done it because I'm too busy.
[02:10:22.970 --> 02:10:32.418]  I've already talked to local, uh, former rodeo star, uh, talked to his, uh, first talked to his brother.
[02:10:32.458 --> 02:10:34.119]  They've got the big ranch to do it on.
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:35.320]  They're interested.
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:37.722]  And then I got too busy and didn't do it.
[02:10:39.664 --> 02:10:42.967]  And I told them 10 million viewers a week conservatively in one year.
[02:10:43.027 --> 02:10:43.848]  That's what I was doing.
[02:10:45.149 --> 02:10:49.813]  But it would be a whole nother division that they would be the host of, the stars of.
[02:10:50.697 --> 02:10:52.598]  People say, well, why not go straight to TV?
[02:10:53.839 --> 02:10:58.163]  Well, there's a bigger audience online, and you don't have to mess with the limited slots on TV.
[02:10:58.383 --> 02:11:00.324]  There's all this fake prestige goes with it.
[02:11:00.765 --> 02:11:03.787]  You know, some reality show person has three million viewers a week.
[02:11:03.827 --> 02:11:04.908]  They're big mega stars.
[02:11:04.928 --> 02:11:06.769]  That's the system trying to prop itself up.
[02:11:07.110 --> 02:11:09.491]  You get three million viewers a week on YouTube, you're nobody.
[02:11:11.433 --> 02:11:13.695]  Now, I'm gonna go to Bob Chapman here, but I'll finish up with Steve briefly.
[02:11:14.235 --> 02:11:16.557]  Okay, here's the big idea for everybody out there.
[02:11:18.348 --> 02:11:18.688]  Okay?
[02:11:19.328 --> 02:11:21.509]  And quite frankly, you can't even oversaturate this.
[02:11:24.451 --> 02:11:26.372]  Because it'll just sell the culture of liberty.
[02:11:26.692 --> 02:11:43.139]  I've run into all these talk show hosts over the years who would literally bend over backwards to try to make stuff up about me, incredible confabulations, lies, thinking that if they got Alex Jones off the radio that that would somehow my audience would go over to them.
[02:11:43.299 --> 02:11:44.520]  What morons!
[02:11:46.064 --> 02:11:48.546]  Alex Jones makes the Liberty Movement bigger for everybody.
[02:11:49.647 --> 02:11:51.768]  Ron Paul makes the Liberty Movement bigger for everybody.
[02:11:52.388 --> 02:11:53.689]  Bob Chapman makes it bigger.
[02:11:53.970 --> 02:11:54.610]  On and on and on.
[02:11:56.591 --> 02:11:57.672]  You make the pie bigger.
[02:11:57.832 --> 02:12:02.355]  That's a win-win-win, freedom wavelength, not the tyranny.
[02:12:02.936 --> 02:12:05.718]  It's a limited pie, let's cannibalize our self-system.
[02:12:07.182 --> 02:12:10.605]  So see, I'll give you my ideas here, because I don't care.
[02:12:11.305 --> 02:12:12.486]  I care about the information.
[02:12:12.926 --> 02:12:15.728]  And you can implement this, and whoever implements it the best will do the best.
[02:12:15.748 --> 02:12:19.631]  In fact, you could probably get 20 million viewers a week doing this if you did it right.
[02:12:20.892 --> 02:12:29.198]  I guarantee I could have 10 million viewers a week, which is a big TV show by any stretch of imagination, on YouTube platform alone, within one year of implementing this.
[02:12:29.299 --> 02:12:29.559]  Okay?
[02:12:30.179 --> 02:12:30.840]  Ready to hear the idea?
[02:12:32.355 --> 02:12:35.836]  Companies, by the way, major networks have asked me to consult for them and I've said no.
[02:12:35.856 --> 02:12:36.336]  Okay?
[02:12:36.897 --> 02:12:39.057]  The system knows I know how to build an audience, okay?
[02:12:40.318 --> 02:12:41.418]  And I won't work for the enemy.
[02:12:42.599 --> 02:12:44.699]  So I'm gonna give you information here that's extremely valuable.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:48.841]  This is just one of literally unlimited ideas, okay?
[02:12:50.361 --> 02:12:57.464]  You gotta get a piece of property, at least preferably 500 yards, in an area where there's no laws against shooting firearms.
[02:12:59.195 --> 02:13:07.098]  And you've got to shoot cans of Coca-Cola, pumpkins, exploding human targets you call zombies.
[02:13:07.138 --> 02:13:07.918]  Folks are doing that.
[02:13:08.498 --> 02:13:12.800]  People love long shots, 1,000 yards, 2,000 yards, 3,000 yards.
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:19.202]  You can get local gun shops, because they're a sponsor at first, to be on it, and they'll let you borrow the new firearms every week.
[02:13:19.723 --> 02:13:25.845]  You go out, and even if you don't have the skills to shoot, you go find somebody that does, a little gunsmith or something.
[02:13:26.485 --> 02:13:38.872]  And you do that for a year straight, and don't get on power trips and fight with each other and stuff, and have a contract, and you put those up on the internet, you will have a million views a week if you are terrible.
[02:13:40.113 --> 02:13:43.034]  If you name it right and take action, just put basic energy into it.
[02:13:43.395 --> 02:13:46.717]  Power in this universe is about doing things over and over again.
[02:13:46.737 --> 02:13:49.058]  It's about commitment.
[02:13:50.979 --> 02:13:51.619]  Beating a drum.
[02:13:53.300 --> 02:13:54.321]  It's about who wants it the most.
[02:13:55.438 --> 02:13:56.298]  We'll go the longest.
[02:13:58.699 --> 02:14:02.120]  I have watched for years these shooting videos on the internet.
[02:14:03.301 --> 02:14:06.762]  And I mean, some of these things are getting 15 million views apiece, the average about a half million.
[02:14:07.242 --> 02:14:10.383]  I mean, this is stuff that probably costs these videos $100, $200 to produce each one.
[02:14:14.235 --> 02:14:14.915]  And it's unlimited.
[02:14:15.235 --> 02:14:18.237]  There are people with very low talent getting millions of views on there.
[02:14:18.637 --> 02:14:23.419]  Now, once you've established your audience, you slip the Patriot information into it.
[02:14:24.039 --> 02:14:32.022]  Then you start a new political division of the YouTube channel, where you sit around and talk about the New World Order, and then say, next, here's our video.
[02:14:32.803 --> 02:14:35.504]  And now you get those millions of people into the new thing.
[02:14:36.323 --> 02:14:36.864]  There you go.
[02:14:37.664 --> 02:14:42.809]  Valuable consulting information for you right there.
[02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:45.231]  And I could right now launch this.
[02:14:45.592 --> 02:14:46.132]  Right now!
[02:14:48.094 --> 02:14:52.999]  Right now I could launch this with celebrities, you know, in the whole redneck kingdom.
[02:14:54.082 --> 02:15:02.507]  Endlessly, I could have a TV deal within a year from now and wouldn't even take the TV deal because it wouldn't make as much money as a YouTube channel with sponsorship.
[02:15:02.527 --> 02:15:05.029]  You notice my YouTube channel doesn't have sponsors.
[02:15:05.049 --> 02:15:05.809]  I've chosen not to.
[02:15:06.230 --> 02:15:11.433]  This would be a consumer and would also sell the culture of liberty bonanza.
[02:15:12.974 --> 02:15:13.434]  There you go.
[02:15:14.035 --> 02:15:14.595]  So there you go.
[02:15:15.135 --> 02:15:17.397]  Now, Steve, I can only give you about a minute because Bob Chapman's holding.
[02:15:17.657 --> 02:15:18.578]  You said you had a question.
[02:15:18.598 --> 02:15:18.938]  Go ahead.
[02:15:20.165 --> 02:15:32.538]  Yeah, my question is, I've heard you say at least a hundred times in the last two and a half years that Tom Ridge got on C-SPAN and said that the police state was going to be implemented.
[02:15:32.938 --> 02:15:33.959]  It was just a matter of time.
[02:15:35.017 --> 02:15:36.379]  Is that video out there somewhere?
[02:15:36.619 --> 02:15:36.799]  Is it?
[02:15:53.061 --> 02:15:55.402]  And he just said you're going to have an ID to get a job.
[02:15:55.422 --> 02:15:58.304]  We're going to have checkpoints on the highways for your safety.
[02:15:58.644 --> 02:16:00.705]  Homeland Security will run every facet.
[02:16:00.985 --> 02:16:03.346]  And I've been saying that for nine years since I saw it.
[02:16:03.707 --> 02:16:05.988]  Now they announced they're doing all of it.
[02:16:06.028 --> 02:16:08.429]  So it doesn't even really matter if you can't dig up that video.
[02:16:08.749 --> 02:16:11.250]  I've been on air for nine years saying it, and now it's happening.
[02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:12.651]  So there's your answer.
[02:16:12.691 --> 02:16:13.572]  But somebody can dig it up.
[02:16:15.553 --> 02:16:16.793]  Yeah.
[02:16:16.813 --> 02:16:21.376]  Is there also somebody's email there that we can email to?
[02:16:22.864 --> 02:16:27.609]  Maybe ask for links whenever, you know, you just... I sure wish we did.
[02:16:27.629 --> 02:16:31.152]  You know, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:16:31.733 --> 02:16:34.475]  Are you saying you want me to provide you proof of everything I say?
[02:16:34.495 --> 02:16:37.018]  I mean, have my crew send you stuff?
[02:16:37.959 --> 02:16:38.499]  No, no, no.
[02:16:38.559 --> 02:16:40.501]  I just... It's so hard to find links.
[02:16:41.142 --> 02:16:41.342]  Yeah.
[02:16:41.562 --> 02:16:42.903]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:16:44.091 --> 02:16:47.557]  I am busier than a one-legged man in a you-know-what kicking contest.
[02:16:48.359 --> 02:16:52.866]  I am trying to get enough money in here to hire and then train the right crews.
[02:16:54.241 --> 02:17:03.148]  To where I can have ten reporters, not two or three, and to where I can find people that are skilled to basically intensify what I'm doing.
[02:17:03.188 --> 02:17:06.711]  It isn't about making Alex Jones a big kahuna, you know, in media.
[02:17:06.791 --> 02:17:10.554]  It's about a system resisting them, teaching others how to resist.
[02:17:12.276 --> 02:17:13.877]  And then people say, give us a link.
[02:17:13.897 --> 02:17:15.939]  You just asked for a link nine years old.
[02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:23.685]  C-SPAN, just recently in the last year, came up with a system where you can search pretty much anything by name
[02:17:29.403 --> 02:17:30.444]  I mean, I don't even know what to say.
[02:17:30.464 --> 02:17:37.411]  95% of what I've covered here today, I've shown you the news article.
[02:17:38.939 --> 02:17:42.862]  Now, if you ask me for something nine years from now, I'm gonna have to tell you, you have to go find it.
[02:17:42.882 --> 02:17:44.983]  I mean, you're saying it's so hard to find links.
[02:17:45.504 --> 02:17:53.630]  There is a, every day, there's an eruptive amount of information on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:53.650 --> 02:17:57.793]  I mean, at this point, we're not even trying to prove there's a global government anymore.
[02:17:58.273 --> 02:17:59.013]  They're announcing it.
[02:17:59.033 --> 02:17:59.854]  Let's go to Bob Chapman.
[02:17:59.894 --> 02:18:02.496]  Bob, thanks for holding while I tried to answer that guy's question.
[02:18:02.516 --> 02:18:04.237]  You're with us for the next 40 plus minutes.
[02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:25.292]  What do you make of, and I've got the big stacks here, I guess I've got to read them to the fella, where they're announcing banking dictatorship worldwide, and just kind of announcing like it's no big deal, private banks headed up by Goldman Sachs will now rule the planet, and you'll pay your taxes directly to them, and countries can't get out of it, and the Euro will control what the countries do now.
[02:18:25.892 --> 02:18:27.473]  It's an open tyranny, Bob.
[02:18:27.893 --> 02:18:32.715]  Everything we said has come true, and I guess some of the public will probably ask us for links to it.
[02:18:34.844 --> 02:18:38.146]  Well, they're going to have to go look for themselves because we're too busy to do that.
[02:18:38.987 --> 02:18:45.432]  But, uh, I think a lot of that is just first grade propaganda.
[02:18:46.132 --> 02:18:49.935]  I don't think they're really in a position to move into that as yet.
[02:18:50.535 --> 02:18:56.280]  And that is starkly shown up in the situations going on in Europe.
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:59.202]  I mean, these people don't know what to do.
[02:18:59.955 --> 02:19:01.196]  They are really stuck.
[02:19:01.656 --> 02:19:03.536]  They put it all together and it doesn't work.
[02:19:03.576 --> 02:19:03.977]  That's right.
[02:19:03.997 --> 02:19:12.680]  They always sold themselves on they'd wreck the system and then they'd come out on top, but now that they've actually driven the bus off the cliff, things aren't going so well, Bob.
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:17.482]  Well, that is the end of statement of the week, of the year, whatever.
[02:19:18.482 --> 02:19:19.783]  And the point is this.
[02:19:21.043 --> 02:19:22.144]  They created a monster.
[02:19:22.204 --> 02:19:22.684]  What was it?
[02:19:22.824 --> 02:19:24.785]  A natural, unnatural association?
[02:19:26.165 --> 02:19:28.446]  All the members in the Eurozone had to have
[02:19:29.485 --> 02:19:35.688]  Public debt of 3% of GDP or less, and they knew darn right well that half of them couldn't meet that.
[02:19:36.429 --> 02:19:41.291]  Then, they had one interest rate for everybody, which was absolutely ridiculous.
[02:19:41.371 --> 02:19:45.073]  I mean, Germany's paying 3.5%... All right, well, let's talk about that, Bob.
[02:19:45.093 --> 02:19:45.333]  Stay there.
[02:19:45.353 --> 02:19:46.214]  Coming right back to you.
[02:19:46.234 --> 02:19:47.854]  Let's talk about what's happening in Europe.
[02:19:48.275 --> 02:19:49.115]  Will it melt down?
[02:19:49.135 --> 02:19:50.036]  What comes out of that?
[02:19:50.056 --> 02:19:51.736]  You predicted this three years ago or more.
[02:19:52.877 --> 02:19:54.318]  And then we're going to get into MF Global.
[02:19:54.338 --> 02:19:57.279]  Now it's $3 billion missing, and they're saying you're not getting your money back.
[02:19:58.740 --> 02:20:00.822]  We'll be right back at TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:20:01.462 --> 02:20:07.207]  Attention GCN listeners, do you have a patriot on your Christmas list that's nearly impossible to shop for?

[02:21:02.199 --> 02:21:05.863]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:21:06.284 --> 02:21:11.691]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:21:12.171 --> 02:21:13.232]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:21:13.272 --> 02:21:17.317]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:21:17.978 --> 02:21:31.249]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:21:31.789 --> 02:21:37.094]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:21:37.394 --> 02:21:43.218]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:21:47.284 --> 02:21:49.467]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:21:49.487 --> 02:21:49.547]  1-800-686-2237.

[02:23:01.906 --> 02:23:09.193]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan and making its way across the entire U.S.
[02:23:09.233 --> 02:23:12.016]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[02:23:12.256 --> 02:23:15.019]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[02:23:15.259 --> 02:23:19.884]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S.
[02:23:20.044 --> 02:23:22.006]  unless you do something to protect yourself.
[02:23:22.246 --> 02:23:22.547]  How?
[02:23:22.827 --> 02:23:25.730]  With liquid zeolite from RestoreYourHealthNow.com.
[02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:30.575]  Without a doubt, Liquid Zeolite is by far the best product to remove radiation from your body.

[02:24:11.243 --> 02:24:18.008]  They got a lot of nice girls down here.
[02:24:39.978 --> 02:24:52.041]  Alright, we are back live, down on the range, La Grange, going back to our guest, and then your phone calls Bob Chapman.
[02:24:52.561 --> 02:25:07.085]  Bob, I want to get into the euro and what's happening over there, and I've got the quotes here about global takeover by Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs conquers Europe, conquers them, they sold them the fraud, and got their agents in every position.
[02:25:08.209 --> 02:25:10.090]  And now there's riots over austerity.
[02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:12.171]  But I want to get into, then into MF Global.
[02:25:12.211 --> 02:25:13.272]  We haven't gotten your take on this.
[02:25:13.352 --> 02:25:14.692]  I knew it would be big two weeks ago.
[02:25:15.132 --> 02:25:16.833]  Driving down stock markets worldwide.
[02:25:17.634 --> 02:25:19.034]  Farmers getting out of commodities.
[02:25:19.094 --> 02:25:21.135]  Reuters reporting it's causing a crash there.
[02:25:22.476 --> 02:25:25.137]  Why wouldn't they pay back the billion, three billion?
[02:25:25.157 --> 02:25:26.058]  Now it's up to three billion.
[02:25:26.638 --> 02:25:27.699]  Why wouldn't they pay it back?
[02:25:27.719 --> 02:25:29.560]  I mean, they've got to know it's going to destroy confidence.
[02:25:29.880 --> 02:25:30.460]  Bob Chapman.
[02:25:31.741 --> 02:25:34.382]  I think maybe part of the intention here
[02:25:35.137 --> 02:25:38.299]  Was twofold, and there's no way we can prove this at this point.
[02:25:38.859 --> 02:25:43.242]  But I thought from the very beginning that the United States government might have been involved in this.
[02:25:44.523 --> 02:25:52.588]  And Corzine was probably given a guarantee that, look, you do this for us and we'll cover for you and so on and so forth.
[02:25:53.789 --> 02:25:57.091]  Second of all, I think they might have wanted to damage that system.
[02:25:58.052 --> 02:26:00.714]  And it's a system that they can't totally control.
[02:26:00.734 --> 02:26:03.896]  And I think they would like to control it totally.
[02:26:04.765 --> 02:26:08.388]  And the way of doing that is causing problems with the industry.
[02:26:08.888 --> 02:26:09.608]  You're incredible!
[02:26:09.648 --> 02:26:18.574]  So for those that don't know, they want to destabilize the entire derivatives commodity market so they can get more regulatory control, which means more insider trading control.
[02:26:19.195 --> 02:26:21.777]  So they can game the casino even better.
[02:26:22.157 --> 02:26:30.382]  That's why Corzine and the head of the CFTC who's involved in it have been authorized to say, we're keeping the money and that's the way it is, is to destroy confidence.
[02:26:32.364 --> 02:26:32.824]  Exactly.
[02:26:33.806 --> 02:26:45.729]  And as far as the CME is concerned, Gerald Salenti has pointed out with former tapes of Terry whatever his name is, that they were bragging they have a hundred billion dollars.
[02:26:46.509 --> 02:26:48.329]  And they can insure anything.
[02:26:48.369 --> 02:26:49.610]  Well, why aren't they insuring it?
[02:26:50.070 --> 02:26:52.310]  They're obviously part of this.
[02:26:52.871 --> 02:26:56.992]  But I do think it's going to drive a lot of people out of that futures market.
[02:26:57.612 --> 02:26:58.552]  And that's a good thing.
[02:26:59.752 --> 02:27:03.153]  Because the least amount of power they have, the better.
[02:27:03.895 --> 02:27:13.104]  Of course, in those commodity contracts, you've never had any safety whatsoever, because quite frankly, they were never worth the paper they were written on.
[02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:23.975]  And that was because the CME, which owns ComEx, could at any time override anything that was in the rulebook.
[02:27:24.676 --> 02:27:26.558]  And so you really didn't have any protection.
[02:27:27.319 --> 02:27:29.340]  Uh, that doesn't exist in general markets.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:36.023]  So is this a test balloon even though he'd already gotten the money and it was in his sequestered, uh, segregated account?
[02:27:36.764 --> 02:27:39.005]  Uh, they just, I mean, is this a test balloon then?
[02:27:39.185 --> 02:27:43.387]  Because if you're saying it's good to run speculators out, why would the system want to do this then?
[02:27:44.668 --> 02:27:45.188]  I don't know.
[02:27:45.208 --> 02:27:47.729]  Uh, there's a lot of things we don't know yet.
[02:27:48.490 --> 02:27:51.611]  Uh, including will anybody get paid?
[02:27:52.432 --> 02:27:54.893]  Uh, when they just come out and said there's $3 billion missing.
[02:27:56.529 --> 02:28:03.094]  Yesterday they said that they were going to pay 60% of the money back by the 15th of December.
[02:28:04.195 --> 02:28:05.736]  You know, it's one story after another.
[02:28:05.796 --> 02:28:08.218]  It's something you have to watch unfold.
[02:28:09.259 --> 02:28:10.500]  It looks like a rope-a-dope.
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:10.920]  You're right.
[02:28:10.980 --> 02:28:15.764]  I mean, it looks like a rope-a-dope because they said two weeks ago they were going to pay it back that week and didn't.
[02:28:17.306 --> 02:28:21.249]  Yeah, that's another thing, which is the extension of time.
[02:28:22.390 --> 02:28:23.210]  What do we do next?
[02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.771]  We don't know.
[02:28:24.526 --> 02:28:27.167]  And that's the same thing that's going on in Europe as well.
[02:28:28.067 --> 02:28:30.648]  And it's because they just don't know.
[02:28:32.069 --> 02:28:37.091]  And I can't help but think, you know, Corzine is smart.
[02:28:37.991 --> 02:28:38.451]  Obviously.
[02:28:39.191 --> 02:28:41.612]  Because of his background, if nothing else, you know he is.
[02:28:42.272 --> 02:28:47.334]  Why would he make a one-way bet that was an obvious loser?
[02:28:48.294 --> 02:28:49.595]  Now the government could have said, look,
[02:28:50.151 --> 02:28:52.732]  We want you to take that money over there and do this.
[02:28:52.812 --> 02:28:56.093]  Go along those bonds that are in serious trouble.
[02:28:56.113 --> 02:28:57.754]  Yeah, because somebody else gets the money.
[02:28:57.814 --> 02:29:02.595]  So it's just a transfer of all the investors' money to the casino.
[02:29:04.936 --> 02:29:11.878]  To help stabilize that market in Europe that they weren't capable of doing even through the ECB at that time.
[02:29:12.739 --> 02:29:16.300]  And that's what I think the government was originally up to.
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:19.561]  And then they finally said, well, we're going to do these other things.
[02:29:20.037 --> 02:29:23.938]  So we're going to take it down, and don't worry, you'll be well taken care of.
[02:29:24.698 --> 02:29:25.758]  And they do those things.
[02:29:26.479 --> 02:29:28.579]  You know, two years later, everybody forgets.
[02:29:28.599 --> 02:29:31.040]  Stay there.
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:35.041]  I want to see the grand design here with Bob Chapman on the other side of this quick break.
[02:29:35.601 --> 02:29:41.362]  And we'll get more into the other facets of the economy, the war that's building up in Syria, and what that's going to signify.
[02:29:41.402 --> 02:29:43.323]  The Russians saying it's a red line, don't cross it.
[02:29:43.643 --> 02:29:45.023]  And your phone call straight ahead.
[02:29:45.743 --> 02:29:47.204]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:29:47.224 --> 02:29:48.744]  7 o'clock tonight, a special report.
[02:29:50.387 --> 02:29:53.389]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.330 --> 02:29:57.092]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.237 --> 02:30:03.758]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:30:03.978 --> 02:30:09.002]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:30:09.282 --> 02:30:10.643]  Saving means to make money.
[02:30:10.824 --> 02:30:19.591]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:30:20.331 --> 02:30:27.416]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:30:27.856 --> 02:30:35.461]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:30:35.861 --> 02:30:43.265]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:30:46.027 --> 02:30:48.951]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:30:49.232 --> 02:30:51.415]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:30:51.435 --> 02:30:52.837]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:31:02.068 --> 02:31:06.350]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:31:06.751 --> 02:31:12.634]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:31:13.194 --> 02:31:14.935]  Number one, study the past.
[02:31:15.455 --> 02:31:17.216]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:31:17.857 --> 02:31:21.579]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:31:22.717 --> 02:31:24.979]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:29.062]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:31:29.643 --> 02:31:34.366]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:31:34.687 --> 02:31:38.149]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:41.552]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:31:42.113 --> 02:31:45.735]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:46.596 --> 02:31:50.837]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:31:51.517 --> 02:31:55.638]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:31:56.138 --> 02:31:58.898]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:32:01.279 --> 02:32:15.722]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:16.741 --> 02:32:20.463]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:21.443 --> 02:32:33.449]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:34.209 --> 02:32:41.473]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:32:42.153 --> 02:32:51.762]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:32:52.522 --> 02:32:55.785]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:32:56.466 --> 02:32:59.569]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:23.432]  Look, a lot of people say, be optimistic, be positive.
[02:33:24.813 --> 02:33:34.281]  If you're about to be dropped into a pit of piranhas, you need to get out of that situation, not be optimistic of, oh, maybe the piranhas won't eat me today.
[02:33:34.301 --> 02:33:36.302]  Because actually, I've read about piranhas.
[02:33:36.322 --> 02:33:37.323]  Sometimes they don't attack.
[02:33:38.444 --> 02:33:42.027]  You've got like a 50-50 chance you drop into the pit of piranhas and they're not going to start biting.
[02:33:42.447 --> 02:33:47.331]  But if that first one bites and there's blood in the water and they smell it, it's over.
[02:33:52.202 --> 02:34:13.191]  And the elite have written all these books, publications, we talk about them, we read the quotes all the time, we publish them, we make special reports about them, I make films about them, about how we're trash, they're gonna do all this and break up our families and how they're gonna set up a world banking system and implode it to bring in austerity, Club of Rome 1963, and I'm watching them do it all.
[02:34:17.053 --> 02:34:19.014]  And I don't want to go there.
[02:34:19.314 --> 02:34:20.595]  I don't want this to happen.
[02:34:21.758 --> 02:34:25.299]  So I am as negative and nasty sounding as I can be.
[02:34:25.859 --> 02:34:31.941]  Because as negative and nasty as I can be about these people, using the facts, it can't approach the reality.
[02:34:32.281 --> 02:34:33.582]  It's still just words.
[02:34:35.462 --> 02:34:38.503]  You know, living in an African country, most of them, it's absolute hellhole.
[02:34:39.003 --> 02:34:40.984]  They don't have any due process, any basic rights.
[02:34:41.784 --> 02:34:43.605]  Living in many areas of the Middle East is that way.
[02:34:43.645 --> 02:34:45.065]  Living in many areas of Latin America.
[02:34:47.166 --> 02:34:51.347]  Liberty and freedom and rule of law, good law, brings incredible wealth.
[02:34:54.048 --> 02:34:55.349]  You take that away, folks.
[02:34:55.409 --> 02:34:56.991]  It's like taking oxygen out of the room.
[02:34:58.633 --> 02:35:05.700]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, you need to be a leader in your area.
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:07.341]  In fact, we put it back on screen.
[02:35:08.062 --> 02:35:15.630]  Somebody went up and put a bunch of graffiti up on the side of the billboard pushing Colin Powell and Rudy Giuliani with
[02:35:17.128 --> 02:35:21.532]  The stupid Get Motivated events that are $1.95, clearly a big brainwashing session.
[02:35:21.552 --> 02:35:22.733]  I've watched clips of it online.
[02:35:23.313 --> 02:35:25.475]  Somebody went up there and put war criminals, you know, up there.
[02:35:25.815 --> 02:35:27.577]  Put up there a bunch of liars, and that's good.
[02:35:28.698 --> 02:35:29.979]  And that Pat Tillman was killed.
[02:35:29.999 --> 02:35:36.944]  I don't know, Kurt's gonna do a story on Infowars.com about it.
[02:35:37.645 --> 02:35:40.107]  People could say, well, what are you doing, advocating people doing that?
[02:35:40.167 --> 02:35:41.148]  No, I'm not advocating that.
[02:35:43.220 --> 02:35:46.221]  But desperate times mean desperate measures, don't they?
[02:35:46.261 --> 02:35:47.281]  Is that a desperate measure?
[02:35:47.761 --> 02:35:54.083]  We have, like, an oligarchy of Hitlers running our country, and we're not going to do whatever it takes to get attention?
[02:35:54.504 --> 02:36:07.768]  I saw an article out of Phoenix, Arizona, where they did a little banner hang with Republican and Democrats, the donkey and the elephant, and it said, two parties creating tomorrow's problems.
[02:36:08.803 --> 02:36:11.585]  And they're up there peacefully putting it up on an overpass.
[02:36:11.605 --> 02:36:14.667]  They send a SWAT armored vehicle to them.
[02:36:15.728 --> 02:36:19.110]  And the SWAT team jumps out because that's what the SWAT team's for.
[02:36:19.570 --> 02:36:21.852]  They want to clear out the prisons of violent offenders.
[02:36:22.332 --> 02:36:27.716]  There's actually government handbooks on this from Eastern Europe to put the political prisoners in it.
[02:36:27.756 --> 02:36:32.399]  I was watching Clockwork Orange again yesterday and they send in the new Prime Minister.
[02:36:34.281 --> 02:36:42.044]  The Secretary of the Interior's man, and the Secretary of the Interior comes into the prison, they're looking for somebody to do this Pavlovian brainwashing on him to stop violence.
[02:36:43.104 --> 02:36:45.425]  It takes your free will away, it's operant conditioning.
[02:36:47.286 --> 02:36:50.587]  And he says, I don't care, Warden, what you think about this.
[02:36:50.667 --> 02:36:54.849]  We've got to empty these prisons of violent offenders to put political prisoners in them.
[02:36:58.190 --> 02:36:59.991]  That's a Stanley Kubrick film from the 60s.
[02:37:04.665 --> 02:37:06.827]  It's all about psychopaths running government.
[02:37:10.590 --> 02:37:12.831]  What a genius Kubrick was.
[02:37:15.267 --> 02:37:15.947]  This stuff's real.
[02:37:16.287 --> 02:37:17.108]  Going back to Bob Chapman.
[02:37:17.128 --> 02:37:21.049]  Bob, I want to go to some calls here, but continuing to look at this thing.
[02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:23.830]  You predicted this happening, so where does it go from here?
[02:37:25.390 --> 02:37:30.172]  Every time they implode another country and get tens of trillions for that, then it only accelerates to the next country.
[02:37:30.512 --> 02:37:31.612]  So we know they engineered it.
[02:37:31.652 --> 02:37:36.073]  They're being praised as, look at how Goldman Sachs took over a banking dictatorship.
[02:37:36.093 --> 02:37:37.514]  That's Time Magazine today.
[02:37:38.394 --> 02:37:38.834]  Can the U.S.
[02:37:38.854 --> 02:37:41.376]  Federal Reserve help save Europe's banks?
[02:37:41.396 --> 02:37:42.536]  That means taxpayer money.
[02:37:43.157 --> 02:37:57.985]  So while we're being lectured by Republicans about cutting old ladies, you know, Social Security and how great that's going to be, and they're scapegoating welfare queens and people who I'm not for, but they're the least of our problems, what about all this?
[02:37:58.005 --> 02:37:59.626]  I mean, how far are they going to go?
[02:38:00.106 --> 02:38:02.067]  What does this signify for hyperinflation?
[02:38:02.087 --> 02:38:02.628]  Bob Chapman.
[02:38:03.948 --> 02:38:04.669]  Well, first of all,
[02:38:05.305 --> 02:38:06.946]  They brought in this team.
[02:38:07.426 --> 02:38:13.868]  We have three members, Dragne, Monty, and Papalose, or whatever his name is from Greece.
[02:38:14.609 --> 02:38:20.831]  And these people who come in, they call them technocrats, but they are all bankers.
[02:38:20.851 --> 02:38:22.652]  It's just another word for banker.
[02:38:23.512 --> 02:38:26.053]  And they brought them in because they get in serious trouble.
[02:38:27.434 --> 02:38:32.376]  And what they're going to have to do is cut loose the six problem nations.
[02:38:32.816 --> 02:38:34.817]  They'll have to go bankrupt, default,
[02:38:36.074 --> 02:38:41.396]  And come back to their own currency, probably at 50% of what the Euro's worth.
[02:38:43.116 --> 02:38:47.217]  Some of them may choose to go 75% default.
[02:38:49.078 --> 02:39:05.343]  And the reason for that is for the solvent group in the Eurozone, in order for them to take those six countries sideways, say for the next two years,
[02:39:05.874 --> 02:39:07.334]  It's going to cost $6 trillion.
[02:39:07.394 --> 02:39:08.755]  They don't have it.
[02:39:09.335 --> 02:39:11.055]  People in their country don't want to put it up.
[02:39:11.515 --> 02:39:12.636]  It may bankrupt them.
[02:39:13.196 --> 02:39:17.777]  So they're going to have 8 or 10 or 11 members of the Eurozone.
[02:39:17.797 --> 02:39:18.837]  The rest of them will be gone.
[02:39:19.317 --> 02:39:23.558]  And they expect that they're going to be able to put together a stronger Eurozone.
[02:39:24.098 --> 02:39:34.581]  Well, in this crisis period, what Germany is doing, their leadership, Mrs. Merkel and Schaubel, the finance minister, what they're trying to do is interject
[02:39:35.678 --> 02:39:48.944]  Legislation to be passed by the Bundesrat and the Bundestag, and they want them to give up their sovereignty to make fiscal decisions within their own countries.
[02:39:49.864 --> 02:39:56.006]  Once they've got that accomplished, if they can, then they can sort of button down all of Europe.
[02:39:56.767 --> 02:40:04.410]  Well, number one, those other countries that are going to go down, they'll go down over the next, oh, perhaps
[02:40:05.417 --> 02:40:05.918]  Six months.
[02:40:06.198 --> 02:40:07.379]  I mean, maybe it'd take a year.
[02:40:08.059 --> 02:40:11.802]  In the meantime, they'll be trying to bolster what's left of the Eurozone.
[02:40:11.862 --> 02:40:12.583]  It's not going to work.
[02:40:13.003 --> 02:40:19.288]  And the main reason why is that they're going to have to absorb all this debt as these other countries default.
[02:40:19.809 --> 02:40:33.079]  And then on top of that, they're going to have to ring-circle, accumulate the circle of wagons, so to speak, and bail out every bank in Europe.
[02:40:33.499 --> 02:40:34.280]  Because they're all broke.
[02:40:35.228 --> 02:40:41.411]  Now, that alternative is monetizing and extremely inflationary.
[02:40:42.331 --> 02:40:44.612]  And they don't want that, but they're going to get it anyway.
[02:40:45.193 --> 02:40:48.434]  And that should make the wheels fly off the Eurozone.
[02:40:48.934 --> 02:40:49.374]  How long?
[02:40:49.855 --> 02:40:50.915]  Probably a year or two.
[02:40:51.455 --> 02:40:52.656]  Nothing happens overnight.
[02:40:53.163 --> 02:40:55.166]  I keep on reading, oh, the end is near.
[02:40:55.186 --> 02:40:57.009]  Oh, I've been listening to that for years.
[02:41:08.285 --> 02:41:13.309]  But at the same time, all they're doing is enraging the population and waking them up.
[02:41:13.869 --> 02:41:28.680]  And what's this new exercise of Time Magazine Newsweek, Financial Times of London, London Independent, London Telegraph, going, yes, it's global government by the bankers, and yes, the Euro's authoritarian, and yes, it's secretive, and yes, it's deceptive.
[02:41:29.260 --> 02:41:33.343]  I mean, it seems like they're trying to psychologically inoculate us now.
[02:41:33.824 --> 02:41:35.325]  It's like a coming out of the closet
[02:41:36.255 --> 02:41:38.936]  I mean, even if they told him he could do this.
[02:41:50.069 --> 02:41:51.570]  Take now $3 billion.
[02:41:51.610 --> 02:41:53.310]  It was $600 million a week ago.
[02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:55.191]  I told people it would go up.
[02:41:55.251 --> 02:41:59.193]  I mean, it might end up being the whole $6.5 million that they went bankrupt with.
[02:41:59.513 --> 02:42:00.473]  I mean, who knows?
[02:42:01.214 --> 02:42:03.455]  Now they just buy up companies, steal the assets.
[02:42:03.495 --> 02:42:06.816]  The looting has reached crescendo levels, Bob Chapman.
[02:42:07.616 --> 02:42:09.637]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:42:11.318 --> 02:42:13.619]  It's conditioning, exactly the way you put it.
[02:42:14.419 --> 02:42:15.720]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:18.341]  We're running so far ahead of them now.
[02:42:19.204 --> 02:42:22.767]  In informing people throughout the world, they are forced to admit what they're doing.
[02:42:24.128 --> 02:42:26.610]  Goldman Sachs, world government, and so on and so forth.
[02:42:27.410 --> 02:42:39.279]  And one of the things about Europe is that most of the people who are bankers, technocrats, politicians, bureaucrats, they're all for world government.
[02:42:39.699 --> 02:42:41.040]  Almost exclusively.
[02:42:41.861 --> 02:42:44.203]  And they always hark back to the Second World War.
[02:42:44.543 --> 02:42:46.865]  If we have world government, we're not going to have any wars!
[02:42:48.348 --> 02:42:53.372]  Well, they forgot about the guys running around with the machine guns who are herding them into camps.
[02:42:54.313 --> 02:42:55.634]  They've gone through that before.
[02:42:55.914 --> 02:42:58.196]  This is just a different way of getting there.
[02:42:59.137 --> 02:43:13.810]  And so, that's why the docility reigns in Europe, and the bankers are so powerful that they're being allowed to lead people around by the nose, and now it's conditioning time.
[02:43:14.730 --> 02:43:16.592]  Because we've exposed what they're doing,
[02:43:17.182 --> 02:43:21.405]  Now they have to go on and say, well, these people are going to fix everything.
[02:43:21.785 --> 02:43:24.968]  And of course, as you say, Alex, these are the people who caused the problem.
[02:43:24.988 --> 02:43:27.189]  And there's a lot of people who know that now.
[02:43:27.950 --> 02:43:29.611]  And I don't think this is going to fly.
[02:43:30.912 --> 02:43:32.233]  But that's the position they're in.
[02:43:32.613 --> 02:43:34.594]  They have screwed up royally to Europe.
[02:43:35.075 --> 02:43:36.876]  And I don't think it's by design.
[02:43:39.087 --> 02:43:43.810]  Well, they'd always planned to implode things and consolidate power, so they're going with that plan.
[02:43:44.650 --> 02:43:49.093]  But did they not keep control of all their wolves running the hedge funds and Ponzi ops?
[02:43:49.613 --> 02:43:50.994]  Where did they go wrong in all this?
[02:43:51.034 --> 02:43:52.095]  They just got too greedy?
[02:43:52.815 --> 02:43:53.195]  Too much?
[02:43:53.256 --> 02:43:53.896]  Too greedy.
[02:43:54.496 --> 02:44:03.262]  And it's this brazen arrogance that they have that nobody in the world can do what they do because they know more than anybody else about what's going on.
[02:44:04.702 --> 02:44:05.203]  And that's it.
[02:44:05.823 --> 02:44:08.785]  It's a combination of those things, and that's why they do what they do.
[02:44:09.383 --> 02:44:10.744]  I mean, you've talked to these people.
[02:44:10.824 --> 02:44:11.544]  I've talked to them.
[02:44:12.485 --> 02:44:13.866]  I never let them know who I am.
[02:44:13.886 --> 02:44:17.728]  You don't have that advantage.
[02:44:18.849 --> 02:44:24.932]  And you can learn an awful lot from people by they not knowing what your gender is.
[02:44:25.893 --> 02:44:34.498]  And so I just kind of skip around the world and find important people and get them into conversations and I get a lot of information that way.
[02:44:36.363 --> 02:44:38.605]  They're not as arrogant as they used to be, though, Bob.
[02:44:38.625 --> 02:44:45.591]  They put on an arrogant countenance, but I wish they were still arrogant, because that means they're not as aware.
[02:44:45.611 --> 02:44:53.919]  I don't think that they're as arrogant as they used to be, Bob.
[02:44:56.561 --> 02:45:02.767]  Well, I don't very often disagree with you, Alex, but I think they're more arrogant now than they were before.
[02:45:04.082 --> 02:45:11.608]  And they have to put up that facade in order to think that they're the masters of the universe, and you're supposed to accept that.
[02:45:12.788 --> 02:45:19.914]  They're pushing the situation that they're in, and they're powerful control of it as hard as possible.
[02:45:21.175 --> 02:45:22.936]  Well, Bob, sure, sure, sure.
[02:45:22.976 --> 02:45:24.357]  I mean, they're buried.
[02:45:24.377 --> 02:45:28.680]  I mean, there's no way financially they can get out unless more money is created.
[02:45:29.221 --> 02:45:31.543]  And that's the only way they can keep this machine going.
[02:45:31.963 --> 02:45:32.383]  Sure, Bob.
[02:45:32.423 --> 02:45:34.105]  I mean, I know that there's a lot of arrogance.
[02:45:34.345 --> 02:45:35.906]  Mid-level, high-level, low-level.
[02:45:35.926 --> 02:45:41.950]  You got TSA guys who constantly are getting caught raping people in uniform because they think the uniform means, well, I'm above the law.
[02:45:42.251 --> 02:45:44.432]  My administrative right is to sodomize you.
[02:45:44.933 --> 02:45:47.855]  I mean, I understand that that was in the news just the other day.
[02:45:48.575 --> 02:45:50.056]  All of this stuff is going on.
[02:45:50.076 --> 02:45:51.858]  I understand that.
[02:45:53.374 --> 02:45:59.799]  And just like Hitler in the bunker constantly in the last few months thought that, you know, he was saved and some magic thing had happened.
[02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:02.621]  But I don't know.
[02:46:02.661 --> 02:46:07.545]  I mean, I see people like Brzezinski and others raising the alarm and saying we're in trouble.
[02:46:07.965 --> 02:46:12.048]  I mean, I see the White House regulations are saying we're in trouble.
[02:46:13.409 --> 02:46:15.691]  And I do see some of their technocrats warning them.
[02:46:15.731 --> 02:46:16.952]  I mean, certainly that's going on.
[02:46:18.653 --> 02:46:20.955]  Well, the government just came out two weeks ago and said
[02:46:22.122 --> 02:46:26.265]  And this debt was $150 billion in June.
[02:46:26.886 --> 02:46:28.687]  It's now $670 billion.
[02:46:28.727 --> 02:46:29.327]  What is that?
[02:46:29.868 --> 02:46:35.852]  That is the amount of credit default swaps that have been written this year.
[02:46:36.232 --> 02:46:37.914]  That's the total of them.
[02:46:37.934 --> 02:46:38.995]  Now, what do those things do?
[02:46:39.595 --> 02:46:50.443]  They insure bankers who have bought these bonds in Europe, that if they go bankrupt, that those bonds will be paid for by the credit default swipe insurance
[02:46:51.525 --> 02:46:52.846]  Right as in New York City.
[02:46:53.606 --> 02:46:58.508]  Well, if all six of them go under, first of all, the banks in New York are broke.
[02:46:58.548 --> 02:46:59.848]  They're running two sets of books.
[02:47:00.489 --> 02:47:05.751]  Secondly, and more importantly, how are they going to pay this money?
[02:47:06.251 --> 02:47:06.731]  They can't.
[02:47:07.271 --> 02:47:16.515]  Unless, of course, all of a sudden, we have another TARP, and they say, well, you know, the Federal Reserve says, you know, here's $700 billion.
[02:47:17.416 --> 02:47:18.316]  Go fix that thing up.
[02:47:19.690 --> 02:47:20.450]  They may do that.
[02:47:39.725 --> 02:47:41.206]  We really live in Orwellville.
[02:47:42.567 --> 02:47:51.592]  And they met to discuss the unconfirmed crimes of the Syrian regime in Egypt while they're Western-backed military machine guns people on the street and tortures people en masse.
[02:47:52.273 --> 02:47:55.414]  So, I mean, it's now, it's like we're planet hypocrisy or something.
[02:47:55.474 --> 02:47:58.156]  It's reached absurdist levels, Bob.
[02:48:00.057 --> 02:48:08.162]  Well, I think if the United States chooses with NATO to go into Syria, Russia is going to get involved.
[02:48:09.326 --> 02:48:11.408]  And it could be the beginning of a third world war.
[02:48:12.589 --> 02:48:13.609]  So what is Russia gonna do?
[02:48:13.630 --> 02:48:15.331]  I mean, they've said don't cross that red line.
[02:48:15.351 --> 02:48:15.931]  That's a quote.
[02:48:16.071 --> 02:48:17.272]  I mean, what does that mean?
[02:48:18.273 --> 02:48:24.598]  Well, they'll challenge aircraft coming into the country into this no-fly zone that happened to belong to NATO.
[02:48:25.839 --> 02:48:26.840]  And they'll shoot them down.
[02:48:29.142 --> 02:48:34.266]  And incidentally, the Russian equipment of all kinds is just as good as what America's got.
[02:48:34.986 --> 02:48:36.788]  And their pilots are just as good.
[02:48:37.628 --> 02:48:43.894]  So the United States is going to pay a big price for this one, because they send in 20 planes and they lose half of them.
[02:48:44.114 --> 02:48:46.156]  I don't think there's going to be a lot of happy people.
[02:48:47.277 --> 02:48:50.800]  And even if Russia loses half of them, they really could KLS.
[02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:54.303]  This is a very, very important port that they've got here.
[02:48:54.503 --> 02:48:57.206]  It's their jumping-off point.
[02:48:57.931 --> 02:48:59.493]  Uh, for their naval operations.
[02:48:59.693 --> 02:49:06.318]  It's their only Mediterranean, it's their only, it's their only Mediterranean port, and it's, it's, it's absolutely strategic.
[02:49:06.939 --> 02:49:10.782]  Uh, yeah, this, and Russia sees this encirclement that's going on.
[02:49:11.643 --> 02:49:13.604]  And of course, China's teamed up with the globalists.
[02:49:13.624 --> 02:49:14.025]  Do you agree?
[02:49:14.345 --> 02:49:17.127]  Chinese are teamed up with the globalists against Russia?
[02:49:20.270 --> 02:49:22.252]  I suspect it, but I don't know it.
[02:49:22.372 --> 02:49:24.834]  I, it's something I can't firmly say yes.
[02:49:27.682 --> 02:49:28.203]  Amazing.
[02:49:29.044 --> 02:49:34.832]  But, I mean, it just shows they just keep taking country down after country by having rebels that they have attack.
[02:49:34.872 --> 02:49:38.196]  And when the country tries to fight the rebels, they call them peace activists.
[02:49:38.797 --> 02:49:42.142]  I mean, what do you make of them openly giving Libya to Al-Qaeda and admitting it?
[02:49:42.442 --> 02:49:43.864]  And I bring this up to good old boys.
[02:49:44.565 --> 02:49:47.067]  All over the country, I see signs saying, we'll never forget 9-11.
[02:49:47.167 --> 02:49:52.090]  So I go in a barbecue place and they've got, you know, all this stuff festooning everywhere.
[02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:55.693]  And I go in and I say, when I'm getting the barbecue, I say, hey, I see your sign.
[02:49:55.713 --> 02:49:57.794]  Are you concerned about Al-Qaeda being given control of Libya?
[02:49:58.215 --> 02:49:58.915]  They're like, huh?
[02:49:58.935 --> 02:50:01.037]  I don't want to talk about it.
[02:50:01.857 --> 02:50:04.939]  I mean, they just want to act tough and like get upset about Al-Qaeda.
[02:50:04.979 --> 02:50:07.361]  And I'm like, okay, well, our government's working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:50:07.701 --> 02:50:08.862]  They don't want to hear it though, Bob.
[02:50:09.402 --> 02:50:11.224]  They just want Al-Qaeda to be given the basis.
[02:50:12.961 --> 02:50:14.002]  Yeah.
[02:50:14.102 --> 02:50:14.722]  And that's true.
[02:50:15.523 --> 02:50:18.244]  And that's just an extension of the CIA and the U.S.
[02:50:18.284 --> 02:50:18.665]  government.
[02:50:19.625 --> 02:50:24.168]  And that will continue to go on here, there, and everywhere, so to speak.
[02:50:25.089 --> 02:50:29.411]  And they're going to probably push things.
[02:50:29.431 --> 02:50:31.493]  I don't know how quickly it'll happen in Syria.
[02:50:33.214 --> 02:50:37.376]  Things always take longer than you think that they will.
[02:50:38.057 --> 02:50:39.258]  But I expect that
[02:50:40.737 --> 02:50:48.947]  Because they've gone in with this new supply zone, I would think that probably two or three months they might make a move.
[02:50:51.870 --> 02:50:53.672]  Alright, Bob Chapman is our guest.
[02:50:53.692 --> 02:50:56.075]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:50:56.095 --> 02:50:59.759]  We're going to take your phone calls in this segment and the next, and that's it for this broadcast.
[02:50:59.779 --> 02:51:00.180]  Stay with us.
[02:51:01.733 --> 02:51:04.936]  Smokers, are you still smoking traditional cigarettes?
[02:51:05.256 --> 02:51:10.681]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[02:51:11.282 --> 02:51:11.602]  Why?
[02:51:11.942 --> 02:51:15.906]  When you could be smoking or vaping with e-cigarettes by Le Cig.

[02:54:09.328 --> 02:54:11.989]  The social engineers don't want us to realize that
[02:54:13.266 --> 02:54:14.887]  You can't make a deal with this system.
[02:54:16.408 --> 02:54:17.869]  It is attacking everybody.
[02:54:20.751 --> 02:54:22.292]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls here.
[02:54:22.312 --> 02:54:25.174]  Sean in Tennessee, thanks for holding patiently.
[02:54:25.194 --> 02:54:26.395]  Good to hear from you worldwide.
[02:54:26.435 --> 02:54:26.755]  Welcome.
[02:54:27.635 --> 02:54:28.456]  Hey guys, how you doing?
[02:54:28.656 --> 02:54:28.876]  Good.
[02:54:28.896 --> 02:54:30.877]  I talked to you back in August.
[02:54:30.937 --> 02:54:35.420]  I was in law enforcement for about 10 years and I just wanted to make a couple quick points.
[02:54:36.121 --> 02:54:40.724]  It might help the protesters or other people when they protest to quit asking for their rights.
[02:54:41.465 --> 02:54:56.973]  Maybe if they put up billboards or something at their protests stating the first, second, fourth, fifth amendments on the billboards so that it's plain for the officers to see so that they cannot act in good faith and violate those laws without it being in the forefront of the media.
[02:54:57.294 --> 02:55:03.217]  Well, yeah, and then they're also having elements of Occupy Wall Street that's been proven to be George Soros controlled.
[02:55:04.042 --> 02:55:15.364]  And he's now admitting he's funded a bunch of the stuff in the Middle East going on to where they ban my website and things and they ban Ron Paul's stuff so they're just as bad as the police arresting him for their First Amendment.
[02:55:16.013 --> 02:55:23.317]  And they also do things like trying to occupy stores, go into private events with Ron Paul, to then make everybody turn against them.
[02:55:23.597 --> 02:55:27.079]  See how it's designed to turn everybody against the First Amendment?
[02:55:27.539 --> 02:55:34.763]  It's just like they hired fake hippie groups to spit on troops getting off airplanes for photo ops in the 60s and 70s.
[02:55:35.203 --> 02:55:36.323]  This is a psy-op.
[02:55:36.443 --> 02:55:36.844]  Go ahead.
[02:55:38.284 --> 02:55:43.347]  Well, again, if you put the wall right there in front of everybody for any camera to catch it,
[02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:45.121]  It takes the argument away.
[02:55:45.181 --> 02:55:47.882]  Everybody always argues the First Amendment or Second Amendment.
[02:55:47.922 --> 02:55:49.763]  Most people don't even read the Constitution.
[02:55:49.783 --> 02:55:52.865]  The case in point of that would be my father-in-law yesterday.
[02:55:52.885 --> 02:56:03.631]  I was over at his house, and I'd send him an email through Facebook about a 9-11 director's cut, and I asked him if he'd even seen it, and he said, oh, that's all a bunch of crap.
[02:56:03.671 --> 02:56:04.672]  I said, oh, do you watch it?
[02:56:04.732 --> 02:56:06.173]  He said, no, I don't need to watch it.
[02:56:06.193 --> 02:56:07.113]  It's all a bunch of crap.
[02:56:07.133 --> 02:56:11.916]  But they, you know, they shut the dialogue down before they even entertain the other part of the view.
[02:56:12.679 --> 02:56:21.263]  So, I mean, to get the information out to force the conversation is what's needed, because most people don't even want to entertain the thought.
[02:56:21.283 --> 02:56:23.944]  Well, the way to approach it is to explain that it's the truth.
[02:56:23.984 --> 02:56:27.386]  There are criminal elements that are financing terrorist groups.
[02:56:27.886 --> 02:56:31.148]  Hey, father-in-law, you heard they've given Libya to Al-Qaeda.
[02:56:31.348 --> 02:56:33.629]  Let me show you a CBS News headline.
[02:56:34.289 --> 02:56:36.131]  Al Qaeda flag flying over Libya.
[02:56:36.711 --> 02:56:39.514]  Show him that first, and then he'll be like, wow.
[02:56:39.874 --> 02:56:41.335]  Now he'll do one of two things.
[02:56:41.355 --> 02:56:45.339]  He'll either get mad and say, I still don't care, or he'll say, wow, tell me more.
[02:56:45.659 --> 02:56:47.200]  But you've at least got a chance.
[02:56:48.377 --> 02:56:49.738]  Showing them something like that.
[02:56:49.778 --> 02:56:59.648]  I mean, that's one thing that concerned Bilderberg Group this last meeting, this year in Switzerland, we got from Jim Tucker, is the fact that it's come out that their force on the ground is Al Qaeda.
[02:57:00.008 --> 02:57:00.609]  That they do.
[02:57:00.649 --> 02:57:04.032]  They are scared of that, that Al Qaeda works for NATO.
[02:57:04.913 --> 02:57:05.894]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:57:06.869 --> 02:57:12.831]  Well, yeah, just real quick, also, I haven't seen this guy for about three years, but he was a DA buddy of mine.
[02:57:12.851 --> 02:57:16.171]  He's a real good guy, but he saw me in the store, and he didn't say, hey, how you doing, man?
[02:57:16.191 --> 02:57:17.072]  I haven't seen you in a while.
[02:57:17.112 --> 02:57:20.493]  He said, I noticed you post all that Ron Paul stuff on your Facebook.
[02:57:20.513 --> 02:57:21.393]  And I said, well, I like him.
[02:57:21.433 --> 02:57:21.953]  He's a good guy.
[02:57:21.973 --> 02:57:23.513]  And he said, well, somebody has to.
[02:57:23.593 --> 02:57:26.194]  And I said, well, he believes in freedom, the Second Amendment.
[02:57:26.354 --> 02:57:27.534]  He wants to bring the troops home.
[02:57:27.574 --> 02:57:29.415]  He wants to correct our financial issue.
[02:57:29.835 --> 02:57:30.955]  I said, are those not good things?
[02:57:31.015 --> 02:57:32.996]  He said, I believe in some of that.
[02:57:33.636 --> 02:57:34.817]  I'm thinking some of that.
[02:57:34.897 --> 02:57:36.278]  How can you just believe in some of those things?
[02:57:36.559 --> 02:57:42.464]  Well, a lot of people that work for the system have been sold that we've got to have a little tyranny to keep things going.
[02:57:42.504 --> 02:57:42.924]  Yeah.
[02:57:43.785 --> 02:57:48.729]  Again, you've seen the law enforcement magazines where do you torture somebody to stop a terror attack?
[02:57:48.969 --> 02:57:57.356]  It's all this fantasy that the video games are where now you kill cops to stop them from making a mistake and detonating the bomb.
[02:57:58.297 --> 02:57:59.638]  It's his situational ethics.
[02:57:59.998 --> 02:58:00.838]  I appreciate your call.
[02:58:00.858 --> 02:58:03.119]  Bob Chapman, take us out to the next segment here.
[02:58:03.159 --> 02:58:04.560]  What's your take on what he was just saying?
[02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:08.782]  Well, I think there's some validity to it.
[02:58:09.622 --> 02:58:14.684]  And I think law enforcement in general understands these things.
[02:58:14.744 --> 02:58:19.787]  You've got certain people in there, you've always had them in there, that are going to cause problems.
[02:58:20.727 --> 02:58:22.908]  And whether they're sent to do that or
[02:58:23.653 --> 02:58:26.776]  Uh, whether that's, uh, their own making remains to be seen.
[02:58:27.076 --> 02:58:28.777]  And it's probably a combination of both.
[02:58:28.797 --> 02:58:39.545]  Uh, and, uh, I, I, you know, the... The exposure that is being given to the Bilderberger types, uh, Goldman Sachs... Stay there, stay there.
[02:58:39.585 --> 02:58:40.126]  Back in one minute.
[02:58:40.146 --> 02:58:40.666]  I wanna hear this.

[03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:19.781]  I'm out of control today.
[03:00:19.801 --> 03:00:21.262]  I don't want to get to all your calls.
[03:00:21.282 --> 03:00:22.282]  I've got to move quick now.
[03:00:22.302 --> 03:00:26.345]  Deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas.
[03:00:26.685 --> 03:00:30.547]  Transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.068 --> 03:00:33.089]  Man, that's a cool liner.
[03:00:33.109 --> 03:00:34.069]  We've got to play that more.
[03:00:35.590 --> 03:00:38.092]  I want to play that this Sunday.
[03:00:39.493 --> 03:00:40.433]  On the Sunday Show 4 to 6.
[03:00:40.553 --> 03:00:42.654]  Alright, I want to jam in a few more calls from Bob Chapman.
[03:00:43.095 --> 03:00:46.337]  Bob, you were raising the exposure the Bilderberg Group and others are getting.
[03:00:46.377 --> 03:00:46.677]  Go ahead.
[03:00:48.180 --> 03:00:51.102]  And yeah, and they're very, very disturbed about this.
[03:00:51.162 --> 03:00:52.083]  They can't avoid it.
[03:00:53.003 --> 03:01:02.730]  And we talked earlier about conditioning that, yes, this world government sort of thing is going on, and we're the best people to run it.
[03:01:02.770 --> 03:01:13.177]  But on the other side, you've got these people talking about what they're doing, what they caused, and who's the culprit in this whole thing.
[03:01:13.757 --> 03:01:17.920]  And so they're having a hard time handling both sides.
[03:01:18.889 --> 03:01:27.132]  And they're not being successful at muting what needs to be muted for their side, so to speak.
[03:01:28.072 --> 03:01:37.175]  And so I think the gains that they're trying to make, they're paying for extremely painfully.
[03:01:39.776 --> 03:01:41.217]  Let's talk to Mike in New Jersey.
[03:01:41.257 --> 03:01:42.097]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[03:01:43.777 --> 03:01:44.598]  Yeah, can you hear me good?
[03:01:44.778 --> 03:01:45.058]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:46.508 --> 03:01:48.369]  Okay, um, I'm looking at a PDF.
[03:01:48.589 --> 03:01:53.830]  It says, Civil Action 8500, and it was filed in the Southern District of New York.
[03:01:54.110 --> 03:02:00.312]  And it seems to be that it's against, uh, the UN, Ban Ki-moon, the Republic of Italy, and Berlusconi.
[03:02:00.392 --> 03:02:03.853]  And they're accusing them of stealing bonds worth over a trillion dollars.
[03:02:04.414 --> 03:02:07.775]  I was wondering if you guys have heard of this, and the judge is Judge Howell.
[03:02:08.475 --> 03:02:08.975]  H-O-L-W-E-L.
[03:02:09.075 --> 03:02:12.696]  I know there's a lot of actions going on with stolen bonds all over the world.
[03:02:12.736 --> 03:02:14.737]  I heard about this Italy thing a while back, Bob.
[03:02:16.710 --> 03:02:21.654]  I've heard it from time to time, but I don't have knowledge of what the gentleman's speaking of.
[03:02:21.914 --> 03:02:23.455]  Yeah, who's bringing the civil action?
[03:02:23.475 --> 03:02:26.297]  We've had a lot of bogus bonds over the last number of years.
[03:02:27.018 --> 03:02:28.899]  It says Neil F. Keenan.
[03:02:29.079 --> 03:02:31.501]  The last name is K-E-E-N-A-N.
[03:02:32.162 --> 03:02:36.605]  And the law firm is Bleakley, Pratt & Schmidt, LLP.
[03:02:37.686 --> 03:02:39.728]  Do me a favor, email that to Showtips.
[03:02:40.268 --> 03:02:41.589]  That's very interesting, sir.
[03:02:42.630 --> 03:02:43.711]  Okay, I will.
[03:02:44.491 --> 03:02:44.932]  Anything else?
[03:02:46.041 --> 03:02:47.061]  Yeah, one more thing.
[03:02:47.081 --> 03:02:54.084]  Have you ever heard of the Act of 1871 in which they created a corporate government for the United States Corporation?
[03:02:55.185 --> 03:02:55.825]  Yes, I have.
[03:02:55.885 --> 03:02:56.445]  Bob Chapman?
[03:02:59.186 --> 03:02:59.766]  No comment.
[03:02:59.806 --> 03:03:03.708]  I'm not familiar enough with it to make intelligent commentary.
[03:03:04.212 --> 03:03:11.814]  They definitely operate under two different laws, and now they're removing the Republic and phasing in this corporate administrative law system.
[03:03:12.094 --> 03:03:12.935]  There's no doubt about that.
[03:03:12.975 --> 03:03:13.655]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:13.715 --> 03:03:16.076]  One more for Bob Chapman here, and I'm sorry to the others.
[03:03:16.136 --> 03:03:18.056]  I'll see you this Sunday, 4 to 6, I'll be live.
[03:03:19.377 --> 03:03:21.097]  Byron in Alabama, go ahead.
[03:03:23.178 --> 03:03:23.838]  Byron, go ahead.
[03:03:23.858 --> 03:03:25.779]  Can you hear me okay?
[03:03:26.259 --> 03:03:26.839]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:03:29.002 --> 03:03:30.703]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[03:03:30.943 --> 03:03:32.764]  We were actually filming something before.
[03:03:33.084 --> 03:03:34.365]  I actually can't understand you.
[03:03:34.385 --> 03:03:35.646]  Your speakerphone's too bad.
[03:03:36.066 --> 03:03:37.247]  Can you actually pick the phone up?
[03:03:38.547 --> 03:03:39.588]  Can you hear me better now?
[03:03:39.888 --> 03:03:40.408]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:03:41.669 --> 03:03:51.715]  Yeah, so the question that I have basically, you touched on how people kind of go running from the truth when you try to confront people about things, right?
[03:03:52.235 --> 03:03:56.938]  So there's two types of people out there that one go running and the other type basically have to
[03:03:58.524 --> 03:03:59.585]  At whatever their pace is.
[03:04:00.386 --> 03:04:08.053]  Now, what I've done, you basically inspired me to start my own website, basically amplifying your message.
[03:04:08.093 --> 03:04:09.794]  I've emailed a couple of times.
[03:04:10.515 --> 03:04:12.296]  I've actually put up a couple of videos.
[03:04:13.197 --> 03:04:23.506]  One about how on the Brooklyn Bridge, that day that they marched, the Occupy Wall Street protest, snatched an InfoWars.com sign down from in front of the live stream camera.
[03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:28.833]  Yeah, somebody said for me to come watch a video of that, and then I forgot to never point it out.
[03:04:28.873 --> 03:04:33.596]  But yeah, the Occupy leadership doesn't like Ron Paul or Infowars.com.
[03:04:33.636 --> 03:04:34.837]  They banned us on their websites.
[03:04:35.117 --> 03:04:35.897]  We're almost out of time.
[03:04:35.957 --> 03:04:36.698]  Finish up the story.
[03:04:38.019 --> 03:04:47.364]  Okay, so my basic point was that they seem to be pulling all of these stunts to basically where they're trying to slow down the awakening.
[03:04:48.877 --> 03:04:56.223]  I want to know what you see coming as far as the economy, because they seem to be slowing the economy down, but speeding everything else up, like the wars, the police... No, I hear you.
[03:04:56.243 --> 03:04:57.244]  I'll have to talk about it, Sonny.
[03:04:57.284 --> 03:04:58.085]  Thank you, Bob Chapman.
[03:04:58.105 --> 03:04:59.666]  We'll see you back, Sonny, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:59.927 --> 03:05:01.028]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:05:01.788 --> 03:05:05.992]  George Washington said, government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force.
