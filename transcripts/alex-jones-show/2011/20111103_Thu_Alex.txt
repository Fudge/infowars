[00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.423]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.103 --> 00:00:08.144]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:10.005]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:11.445]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:13.146]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:17.348]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:22.010]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:33.383]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:33.503 --> 00:00:34.644]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:42.328]  It is 11-3-11, the third day of November 2011 on this Thursday transmission.
[00:00:43.088 --> 00:00:46.950]  And we are going to now broadcast for 27 hours.
[00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.791]  I will be here.
[00:00:50.814 --> 00:00:53.376]  For I think, what is it, comes out to about 18 of those hours.
[00:00:54.397 --> 00:01:05.387]  We'll take a nap for about three or four hours in the middle of the night, but Aaron Dykes will be live, Paul Watson will be live, we have an incredible lineup of guests.
[00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.590]  This is our second annual 24-hour plus transmission.
[00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.031]  It was actually Jaron's idea.
[00:01:12.153 --> 00:01:34.252]  Last year and obviously we are having our fourth annual money bomb and I'm going to break down briefly coming up at the start of the next segment who's coming up in the next 27 hours and exactly why we're having a money bomb to try to fund the expansion of this operation obviously what your previous support has gone towards predominantly.
[00:01:35.013 --> 00:01:36.454]  Also we are going to
[00:01:38.642 --> 00:01:42.545]  Uh, be premiering the second part of the Charlotte Isserby interview.
[00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:48.189]  The first part blew people away, uh, getting into, uh, education.
[00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:52.292]  Uh, the second part is skull and bones being exposed.
[00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:56.775]  And so that is coming up in the lineup as well.
[00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:04.320]  There is just so much, uh, that we're going to be doing here in the next 24 plus hours, uh, today into Friday.
[00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.125]  And of course I woke up at 4 a.m.
[00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:13.929]  this morning after going to bed at about midnight and then couldn't go back to sleep till about...
[00:02:15.942 --> 00:02:18.463]  Seven for some reason, and I usually am a good sleeper.
[00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:24.906]  And then I slept till about nine, hung out with my children some, and barely got here on time.
[00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:28.688]  So that's why you never see me if my hair is still wet.
[00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:32.690]  Actually, I tend to wake up, eat breakfast, hang out with the family, and then take a shower.
[00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.573]  I am certainly just now jumping in the saddle, and I guess that's good in a way, because I was just going to stay up once I got up at four.
[00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:42.874]  And I was like, no, I better try to go back to sleep.
[00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:43.715]  I'm about to be up.
[00:02:44.515 --> 00:03:10.487]  uh... here for uh... most of the day it's really easy to do this compared to what's the record filibuster it's it's from texas in the legislature over two days can't sit down can't go to the bathroom and can't eat and have to continually talk and cannot lean on anything people are like wow you're gonna broadcast eighteen hours out of twenty seven
[00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.592]  Or I guess more than that, because I'm going to do two hours of the three-hour show on Friday.
[00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:18.773]  I haven't done the math, so I guess it's more like 20 hours.
[00:03:19.273 --> 00:03:20.574]  That is a piece of cake!
[00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:30.798]  Now, where it gets tedious, though, is taking the calls, talking to the interesting guests, because I won't just be up here muttering, like a lot of filibusters do.
[00:03:31.918 --> 00:03:40.382]  I've got to really be thinking, and I'm intrigued, just like the audience is, on all the guests, so I'm listening, I'm thinking, and that's actually what's really, really tiring about it.
[00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:42.454]  It's going over all the news.
[00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:44.635]  Boy, it is wild.
[00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:56.978]  I've got like 10 articles here, mainstream news, where, and of course yesterday you saw Sky Television, London Guardian, Israel set to hit Iran, Netanyahu goes before the cabinet, he says he's getting ready to hit them.
[00:03:57.778 --> 00:03:58.919]  I don't know if they're going to attack.
[00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.899]  All I know is troops are massing in Kuwait.
[00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:07.741]  I've talked to a bunch of military on and off record who say the word they've got is Israel is going to strike.
[00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:10.924]  And they're set in the next few weeks to load that reactor.
[00:04:11.425 --> 00:04:15.730]  Now what I said, some of my folks said it could happen any time in the next two weeks.
[00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.652]  And by that I mean two weeks out.
[00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:19.334]  It could happen any time two weeks out.
[00:04:20.191 --> 00:04:20.371]  I think
[00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:53.328]  Iranian used car salesman in South Texas wanting to attack this shouting ambassador and bombing at the embassy did turn out to be completely phony as a $3 bill.
[00:04:54.088 --> 00:04:57.089]  But still, we've got to talk about what this signifies.
[00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.050]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:03.666]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:08.908]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:10.549]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:19.514]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:27.336]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.776 --> 00:05:35.379]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:43.161]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.942 --> 00:05:48.846]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.

[00:06:02.006 --> 00:06:05.630]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.033]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.274 --> 00:06:14.039]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:20.285]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.465 --> 00:06:22.708]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:23.508]  Tim Geithner?
[00:06:23.548 --> 00:06:23.968]  Bernanke?
[00:06:24.048 --> 00:06:24.668]  They're arsonists!
[00:06:24.728 --> 00:06:25.989]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:28.249]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.133 --> 00:06:49.075]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.415 --> 00:06:58.517]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:08.940]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:23.559]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[00:08:23.579 --> 00:08:24.339]  It is Thursday, 11-3-11.
[00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:28.003]  It is the third day of November, 2011.
[00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:30.585]  We're going to be live here for the next 27 hours.
[00:08:37.952 --> 00:08:38.432]  That's right.
[00:08:39.112 --> 00:08:46.494]  I will do at least 20 hours live here on air, but we also have Paul Watson sitting in for a few hours in the early morning hours.
[00:08:47.094 --> 00:08:48.314]  We have Aaron Dyke sitting in.
[00:08:48.354 --> 00:08:54.075]  We're going to premiere Skull & Bones expose with one of the only witnesses out there.
[00:08:54.795 --> 00:08:58.936]  We are going to have quite a transmission lined up for you.
[00:08:58.976 --> 00:09:01.277]  This is our second annual 27-hour transmission.
[00:09:03.837 --> 00:09:05.778]  Hour number one, I'm going to cover the news.
[00:09:05.918 --> 00:09:18.265]  Then we have historian and geopolitical researcher Joel Skousen joining us in the second hour to talk about Iran, the election, and so much more.
[00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:21.728]  Webster Griffin Tarpley will join us in the third hour.
[00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:36.793]  Catherine Albrecht, Dr. Catherine Albrecht will be joining us to talk about all these announcements to censor the internet, to restrict free speech, and this panoptagon of research control grid the government's put in place.
[00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:44.036]  Of course, the number two talk show host in the world, George Norrie, will be joining us, host of Coast to Coast AM.
[00:09:44.596 --> 00:09:48.938]  David Icke will then be joining us coming up, so that's from 4 to 5 30.
[00:09:49.038 --> 00:09:49.478]  Then at 6 o'clock,
[00:09:52.259 --> 00:09:57.840]  We've got Mike Adams sitting in for my first break from 6 to 8 o'clock.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.441]  Then I return.
[00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:01.761]  Alfred Adask will be joining us.
[00:10:02.321 --> 00:10:04.822]  And Mike Adams has got a bunch of guests lined up as well when he's on.
[00:10:04.842 --> 00:10:05.742]  He'll be in studio.
[00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.023]  We appreciate him doing that.
[00:10:07.863 --> 00:10:12.144]  Tex Mars is going to be popping in with us as well.
[00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:17.522]  At 10 o'clock tonight, that should be always interesting and informative.
[00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:24.628]  We also have Mr. Corbett of the Corbett Report, always informative and interesting, as well, is going to be joining us.
[00:10:25.008 --> 00:10:30.893]  Fritz Springmeier, fresh out of prison, now first breaking his silence here after being shot up for bank robbery.
[00:10:31.433 --> 00:10:34.716]  The author will be joining us coming up at 1 a.m.
[00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:35.156]  Central.
[00:10:35.497 --> 00:10:36.718]  All these times are central.
[00:10:37.598 --> 00:10:46.563]  Uh, and then of course, uh, we also then have Aaron Dykes from two to four, and he's got some guests and a bunch of premier videos he's going to be playing.
[00:10:46.983 --> 00:10:47.664]  Paul Watson.
[00:10:48.803 --> 00:10:48.983]  I don't
[00:11:09.682 --> 00:11:12.143]  We air the Izzard because that's what people want to see.
[00:11:12.543 --> 00:11:13.483]  Baggage is great as well.
[00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:17.684]  We can just put that up on PrisonPlanet.tv or premiere it on the news, Nightly News or something.
[00:11:18.284 --> 00:11:20.504]  Gerald Salente then joins us at 8 a.m.
[00:11:20.544 --> 00:11:20.984]  Central.
[00:11:22.105 --> 00:11:25.845]  Then we're working on Alan Watt, Jim Mars, and of course Bob Chapman.
[00:11:27.406 --> 00:11:31.067]  And I guess only one of these has question marks and that's Alan Watt, but that'll probably come through.
[00:11:31.447 --> 00:11:33.287]  So that's the only question mark on here.
[00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:36.848]  So, wow, what a lineup that we have.
[00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:40.748]  Great job of the crew getting this together.
[00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:45.450]  Because these are incredible times that we live in.
[00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:50.273]  And unfortunately, our political analysis has been spot on.
[00:11:51.314 --> 00:12:17.012]  It's unfortunate in that we were right, because this is scary stuff, it's horrible, it's disgusting, it's dangerous, I would rather reality be different than we have a tyrannical, maniacal, eugenics-based, anti-human, anti-life culture and system and college and association and society of psychopathic control freaks
[00:12:19.963 --> 00:12:34.748]  Who are protected by a bunch of well-meaning idiots, compartmentalized fools, useful idiots, but also sociopaths, mercenaries, control freaks, scum, sadists, and others.
[00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:42.520]  And they are weaving a web, like a spider weaves a web, of control.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:13:03.149]  The same web that tyrants and control freaks have woven throughout history, but now so much more disgusting and filthy, and the numbers of killed are much higher because the population is larger, and there's a technological overlay, there's a psychotronic overlay, a chemical overlay, a spiritual overlay, a psychological warfare overlay,
[00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:12.033]  Uh, from the flicker rates with the TVs, to the sodium fluoride in the water, and the Prozac in the water, and that's basically what fluoride is, as Ventura pointed out yesterday.
[00:13:12.053 --> 00:13:13.674]  I mean, it's just wild.
[00:13:15.175 --> 00:13:18.437]  Tyrants have always tried to fully dominate, and they've always failed.
[00:13:18.737 --> 00:13:24.040]  And they hate the fact that they can't turn us into slaves, biological androids.
[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.281]  They don't want us to have free will.
[00:13:28.951 --> 00:13:30.893]  Now we got a lot of interesting news.
[00:13:30.913 --> 00:13:36.320]  The White House is being subpoenaed, as you know, over just legalizing illegal aliens, including felons.
[00:13:37.702 --> 00:13:39.404]  And not even deporting felons now.
[00:13:40.812 --> 00:13:50.735]  They're also being subpoenaed over the different energy companies that they publicly gave hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars.
[00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:57.678]  It's billions in total, but 500 plus million to one of the main companies that is made up of his campaign contributors.
[00:13:57.738 --> 00:13:59.138]  They never basically built anything.
[00:13:59.178 --> 00:14:00.819]  It was just a complete scam.
[00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:04.260]  And why would they commit crimes of this magnitude?
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.722]  Because they know the rest of the government at the top is so corrupt that if anybody tries to actually bust them,
[00:14:11.107 --> 00:14:13.748]  They'll just rat them out for all the other issues.
[00:14:14.388 --> 00:14:17.089]  This is the corruption factor once it gets to a certain point.
[00:14:19.329 --> 00:14:26.211]  They also hold the rest of the system hostage because Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others control the derivatives, they control the Social Security.
[00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:27.312]  They run it all.
[00:14:29.692 --> 00:14:31.693]  They're now taking over the Internet as we know it.
[00:14:31.733 --> 00:14:33.473]  They're now taking over free speech as we know it.
[00:14:33.533 --> 00:14:38.675]  This is a group of conscious criminals who have been told they can do whatever they want by their masters.
[00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:50.545]  And if the Republicans get uppity about Fast and Furious, they'll just expose government shipments of guns under Bush to Mexico, and narcotics shipped in that are already in federal court, and the feds have admitted it's true and we've covered it.
[00:14:51.025 --> 00:14:52.526]  El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune.
[00:14:53.786 --> 00:15:01.509]  It is a group of absolute criminals blackmailing each other, and so when you reach that point, the sky is the limit.
[00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.651]  You know, I saw a cop car last night on 290, pushing
[00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:10.880]  Because they've got that little metal bumper, which is useful.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.042]  Pushing... I slowed down to even make sure I was seeing what I was seeing.
[00:15:16.362 --> 00:15:25.286]  Pushing some old man with a broke down pickup truck, looked like a pickup truck from the 60s, up the ramp, up out of the highway.
[00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:32.269]  Not calling a bunch of city trucks, not getting 20 bureaucrats out there to shut down the highway.
[00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:37.391]  Pushing somebody's car up the ramp, up the road to the gas station at the top of the hill.
[00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:42.375]  I actually see police now more than I've seen in years.
[00:15:43.156 --> 00:15:44.858]  I used to see this all the time when I was a child.
[00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:46.861]  Changing people's tires.
[00:15:47.662 --> 00:15:48.523]  Helping them.
[00:15:49.604 --> 00:15:52.689]  Look, I know the average police officer is not a bad person.
[00:15:54.002 --> 00:16:03.008]  But I also know the system is trying to hire bad people, trying to train them to be corrupt, trying to train them that it's a tough guy to violate people's rights.
[00:16:03.368 --> 00:16:04.729]  In fact, I have an article right here.
[00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.372]  This is out of the Sacramento Bee, that's the major paper of Sacramento.
[00:16:09.392 --> 00:16:14.955]  If you guys give me a document cam shot, I'll show people this for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, but this is...
[00:16:16.536 --> 00:16:18.697]  This is up on Infowars.com now.
[00:16:19.657 --> 00:16:42.567]  Controversial t-shirt puts Twin Rivers Police Department in the spotlight, and it shows what looks like a five-year-old child, almost toddler-like, maybe four, four or five-year-old little boy looking out from a grimy prison cell with grimy bars, and it says, you raise them, we cage them.
[00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:50.313]  This t-shirt is on the Twin Rivers Police Officers Association.
[00:16:51.254 --> 00:16:54.036]  And it just shows the sick attitude.
[00:16:54.056 --> 00:16:59.461]  You know, I've heard the police radio transmissions that have made the news across the country where they talk about hunting people.
[00:17:01.161 --> 00:17:04.542]  And where they talk about all this, and it's this dehumanizing attitude.
[00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:09.984]  What police do to the rest of the public ends up coming back on them.
[00:17:10.044 --> 00:17:17.286]  It's like this retired police officer owns this big Trudy's down on Congress, and the city tried to shut it down.
[00:17:17.366 --> 00:17:25.208]  Gave him the permit to build the $150,000 giant deck, then said we're revoking it after it was built, and tried to harass him out of business.
[00:17:25.808 --> 00:17:29.470]  And then tried to send cops in to do stuff to him once they were suing him.
[00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:32.411]  My lawyer is the lawyer that sued him, Eric Taub.
[00:17:33.272 --> 00:17:39.294]  And won, by the way, and now Tab has city people basically making little snide comments and little veiled comments to him.
[00:17:39.875 --> 00:17:42.596]  But that came back on you.
[00:17:43.616 --> 00:17:50.580]  This schizophrenic guy who later came out on the videos, what, there in a suburb of L.A., didn't do anything to the police.
[00:17:52.129 --> 00:17:56.832]  They beat him to death and would do knee drops on his head over and over again for more than 10 minutes.
[00:17:57.272 --> 00:17:58.413]  He killed somebody with one of those.
[00:17:59.093 --> 00:17:59.674]  They killed him.
[00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:01.815]  Then tried to cover it up.
[00:18:01.855 --> 00:18:04.657]  Now the police did charge one of the cops with murder.
[00:18:07.118 --> 00:18:09.459]  One of them murder, two of the other just basic murder.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.423]  You know, the point is that
[00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:22.814]  They're selling you on macho-ness and on corruption and that it's tough and cool.
[00:18:23.134 --> 00:18:23.815]  It's not cool.
[00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:25.196]  It's not cool.
[00:18:26.297 --> 00:18:28.319]  With great power comes great responsibility.
[00:18:28.619 --> 00:18:30.300]  It's honorable to be a servant.
[00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:37.446]  It's honorable if somebody, you know, gets in your face to be in control.
[00:18:38.307 --> 00:18:42.631]  It's honorable to push an old man's truck up the road.
[00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:45.093]  Instead of just saying, I got better things to do.
[00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:48.897]  And see, government is trying to make it where police can't do things like that.
[00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:53.581]  All over the country, they've told police, it's come out in the news, don't respond to crime, go revenue generate.
[00:18:53.902 --> 00:18:56.404]  Don't help people, let them help themselves.
[00:18:58.006 --> 00:19:00.508]  Because they want the people separate from you.
[00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:03.912]  They want the people to see you as the enemy.
[00:19:05.285 --> 00:19:12.693]  Because they want us at each other's throats, when it's just common sense that what happens in society affects police.
[00:19:13.033 --> 00:19:21.261]  You go to, your children go to the same schools as everybody else, same churches, same shopping malls, same shooting ranges, same lakes to go fishing.
[00:19:21.602 --> 00:19:26.907]  Do you want to live in a society with microphones in streetlights and with, they've now announced,
[00:19:27.748 --> 00:19:37.794]  In hotel rooms saying, watch your neighbor, don't trust anybody, and the hotel guests may be terrorists, and we need, it says paying with cash, suspicious, and spy on people's bags in their rooms.
[00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:40.576]  I mean, this is beyond the Soviet Union.
[00:19:40.616 --> 00:19:42.918]  I mean, is this, you really think we'll be safe?
[00:19:43.943 --> 00:19:45.385]  Look at the government at the top.
[00:19:45.745 --> 00:19:46.706]  They're a bunch of crooks.
[00:19:47.447 --> 00:19:50.411]  Only crooks set up governments like this.
[00:19:51.132 --> 00:19:55.116]  And people that work for the government have to ask themselves which side they're on.
[00:19:55.597 --> 00:19:56.057]  Stay with us.
[00:19:56.097 --> 00:19:57.299]  Big news coming up on Israel.

[00:21:34.632 --> 00:21:40.277]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:21:40.797 --> 00:21:50.265]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:21:50.685 --> 00:21:51.846]  The war is here.
[00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:53.588]  It's an info war.
[00:21:54.068 --> 00:21:56.010]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:22:00.584 --> 00:22:07.749]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.

[00:22:31.407 --> 00:22:35.790]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:41.694]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:45.196]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:24:21.604 --> 00:24:24.005]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:26.966]  It is Thursday, the third day of November, 2011.
[00:24:27.526 --> 00:24:34.009]  We're going to be live here for the next 27 hours if you just joined us.
[00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:35.549]  I'm going to get into the economy.
[00:24:35.609 --> 00:24:36.790]  I'm going to get into U.S.
[00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:37.830]  news, world news.
[00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:44.853]  I'm going to get into the incredible announcements by the Israeli government that they are getting ready to strike Iran.
[00:24:44.873 --> 00:24:47.214]  And I told you two and a half weeks ago that
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:52.761]  After the two-week period, I was saying any time after two weeks from now, they could strike.
[00:24:53.861 --> 00:25:02.543]  Because that's what my military sources have said, that's what Ray McGovern said, that's what Bob Baer said of the CIA, that's what all of these people came out and said.
[00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:10.004]  Of course, I was saying it the day before because I have sources, and Israel's trying to sell the idea of striking Iran.
[00:25:10.244 --> 00:25:13.605]  And so I think we should talk about what's going to probably happen if Iran is attacked.
[00:25:15.594 --> 00:25:16.935]  They've got polls in Israel.
[00:25:16.995 --> 00:25:19.638]  Some polls show 50-50 for and against.
[00:25:19.678 --> 00:25:22.300]  Some polls show 70 plus percent against.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.581]  So it's not just monolithic in Israel.
[00:25:24.642 --> 00:25:32.468]  Netanyahu got rid of his Mossad chief, a bunch of other folks earlier in the year because they were saying they're not going along with it.
[00:25:32.808 --> 00:25:34.329]  Now why are they saying that?
[00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.473]  Why are people that are in Israel and in the government saying it's not a good idea?
[00:25:39.874 --> 00:25:41.455]  Why is the US government saying that?
[00:25:43.215 --> 00:25:45.297]  And again, our government's really the big megabanks.
[00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:48.260]  They're not against wars.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.062]  They love to bomb stuff and take stuff over.
[00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:56.969]  It's because Iran, through proxies, is going to attack Israel on all sides.
[00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:05.175]  And the different sides have gotten high-tech weapons out of China and Russia.
[00:26:05.896 --> 00:26:16.464]  And three and a half years ago, you saw in Lebanon, and the Israelis, by the way, have gone back in there, quote, stop rockets, so there's already a force going in there to try to push back, you know, in case there's a full-on war.
[00:26:18.145 --> 00:26:27.993]  The Israeli tanks and troops got pushed back, got defeated, because the people they're fighting do have some high-tech weapons.
[00:26:29.312 --> 00:26:34.114]  They do have some anti-tank, shoulder-fired missiles and other nasty things.
[00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:41.477]  And so any way you slice it, the Straddlehorn Moose getting closed, I'm going to talk more about it later.
[00:26:41.497 --> 00:26:45.178]  This is a very, very serious time.
[00:26:45.878 --> 00:26:47.339]  And for those of you still in denial,
[00:26:48.934 --> 00:27:01.901]  When neocon groups or pro-war groups or government operatives on the internet come out and attack myself and others and say they're lying, there's no way they're going to attack Iran, no one's saying this, it's crazy.
[00:27:02.141 --> 00:27:08.145]  I mean, I noticed two and a half weeks ago when I said the word is they're getting ready to hit Iran any time from two weeks out.
[00:27:10.146 --> 00:27:12.367]  But they want to hit them before the winter comes the next few months.
[00:27:12.727 --> 00:27:14.248]  That's what all my guests concurred with me.
[00:27:16.368 --> 00:27:24.396]  I've never seen just so many internet attacks, media attacks, the usual suspect attacks, because they're getting the order.
[00:27:24.896 --> 00:27:33.264]  By the way, we see this all the time in the IP addresses, because we don't really moderate very much on InfoWars and Prison Planet in the comments, except for calls for violence or
[00:27:33.684 --> 00:27:37.167]  Posting somebody's phone number, you know and say here's their house go after them.
[00:27:37.527 --> 00:27:55.720]  We take stuff like that down But Tim's been trying to get me to he's right to do a YouTube video or report about this and show the IP addresses There'll be one person with ten different identities having fake conversations with themselves and it's all government tactics So we kind of find it interesting as a laboratory
[00:27:56.821 --> 00:28:10.117]  But I think I'm going to start showing the IP address and actually do some reports because they'll have in 10 different handles conversations with themselves and then say, looks like people are waking up to Alex Jones being a fraud.
[00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:13.392]  And it's one guy posing as 10 people.
[00:28:14.012 --> 00:28:16.693]  That's government megaphone program, they call it.
[00:28:17.334 --> 00:28:18.734]  They also call it sock puppets.
[00:28:18.774 --> 00:28:20.875]  I mean, they've admitted for a decade the Pentagon does this.
[00:28:21.176 --> 00:28:23.497]  They have hundreds of PR firms hired to do it.
[00:28:23.797 --> 00:28:25.197]  And of course, we've got them after us.
[00:28:25.217 --> 00:28:27.198]  That's actually come out before.
[00:28:28.639 --> 00:28:34.902]  But wow, I mean, it's actually still incredible to see them doing it.
[00:28:36.462 --> 00:28:43.367]  So we're going to do some reports on that soon, so come on trolls, come on in and show people, because you're also illustrating this for everybody.
[00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:49.852]  People commenting on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, they see it too, they can tell by the writing style.
[00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:58.940]  And I've done this for years, and I don't know why I haven't done a report on it, because it's very interesting to see one person posing as as many as 20 people sometimes.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:10.056]  But they'll use different, and all the same IP addresses, because that's what we, you know, at a certain point we're like, alright, this person has 20 identities, and they're, you know, they're spewing racism all day.
[00:29:11.323 --> 00:29:13.165]  Alex is great because he hates black people.
[00:29:13.825 --> 00:29:18.069]  They'll say stuff like that so people who come to the site feel like they're not wanted there if they're black.
[00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.491]  It's all divide and conquer.
[00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:20.752]  It's all these tricks.
[00:29:20.812 --> 00:29:21.452]  It's all these things.
[00:29:22.313 --> 00:29:31.221]  But I saw the biggest push ever that I've ever seen in Come and Tell Bro and Disinfo when I came out two and a half weeks ago and said,
[00:29:33.541 --> 00:29:37.802]  I guess it was October 13th, and said they've green-lighted an attack on Iran.
[00:29:38.102 --> 00:29:39.663]  Now, of course, you have the news today.
[00:29:40.443 --> 00:29:42.643]  Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[00:29:43.403 --> 00:29:45.824]  Netanyahu goes before Knesset, says he wants to attack.
[00:29:45.924 --> 00:29:47.144]  Israel test-fires missile.
[00:29:47.164 --> 00:29:48.145]  It's all over the news.
[00:29:48.165 --> 00:29:49.505]  They're going to probably attack.
[00:29:50.425 --> 00:29:51.325]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.825 --> 00:29:53.426]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.346 --> 00:29:57.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.158 --> 00:30:02.298]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:30:02.338 --> 00:30:09.001]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:30:09.261 --> 00:30:11.562]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:30:11.822 --> 00:30:17.004]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:30:17.204 --> 00:30:19.965]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:30:20.245 --> 00:30:22.306]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:30:22.546 --> 00:30:28.489]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.011]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:30:32.172 --> 00:30:37.715]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:30:37.975 --> 00:30:39.276]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:30:39.596 --> 00:30:40.776]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:30:40.897 --> 00:30:43.458]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:30:43.578 --> 00:30:44.999]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:30:45.259 --> 00:30:47.622]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:30:47.782 --> 00:30:52.307]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:30:52.427 --> 00:30:54.870]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:30:58.874 --> 00:30:59.955]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:31:01.977 --> 00:31:03.479]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.699 --> 00:31:08.726]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:09.006 --> 00:31:10.368]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:19.320]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:20.061 --> 00:31:27.164]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:27.584 --> 00:31:35.207]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:35.587 --> 00:31:40.509]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:42.990]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.182]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[00:32:06.582 --> 00:32:12.445]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:32:13.026 --> 00:32:14.766]  Number one, study the past.
[00:32:15.287 --> 00:32:17.048]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:21.410]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:32:22.526 --> 00:32:24.788]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:28.892]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:32:29.473 --> 00:32:34.198]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:32:34.518 --> 00:32:37.922]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:32:38.502 --> 00:32:41.383]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:32:41.923 --> 00:32:45.884]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:46.404 --> 00:32:50.666]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[00:32:51.346 --> 00:32:55.467]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:32:55.967 --> 00:32:58.128]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:33:30.128 --> 00:33:35.990]  Rusted chains of prison moons are shattered by the sun.
[00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:42.912]  I walk a road, horizons change, the tournament's begun.
[00:33:43.952 --> 00:33:50.254]  The purple piper plays his tune, the choir softly sing.
[00:33:50.294 --> 00:33:56.356]  Through lullabies and an ancient tongue, through the court of the crimson king.
[00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:07.999]  We are live.
[00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:08.579]  It is 11-3-11.
[00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:10.760]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:19.683]  I'm going to mention again the unbelievably powerful lineup of guests and information that we have coming up today.
[00:34:19.703 --> 00:34:30.707]  I want to go back through that list for people that are just now joining us here in a moment.
[00:34:36.536 --> 00:34:55.728]  Now, continuing here with the situation in Israel, the fact that the system tried to come out and say that that used car salesman, marijuana dealer, was going to blow up the Saudi embassy in D.C.
[00:34:58.956 --> 00:35:17.128]  The fact that it later came out, even in mainstream news, buried in the newspaper, that it was anti-Iranian government opposition groups that were in contact with him, and Mexican drug cartels, and all of these former and current government experts came out and said, this is phony, this is an excuse to attack Iran.
[00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:19.550]  That's what was happening two and a half weeks ago.
[00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:25.994]  As troops are moved into Kuwait, as the buildup happens, as our military bases go on secret alert,
[00:35:27.975 --> 00:35:32.820]  And now Netanyahu goes before the Knesset yesterday and says, I want to hit them.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:38.385]  Last Friday, Washington Times reports they've done the prisoner exchange to get rid of their Palestinian prisoners.
[00:35:38.765 --> 00:35:42.088]  Give up a thousand of them for one Israeli soldier.
[00:35:42.949 --> 00:35:45.051]  All of this is going on.
[00:35:45.872 --> 00:35:50.056]  All of this is happening right now.
[00:35:52.583 --> 00:35:53.904]  In a game of brinksmanship.
[00:35:53.924 --> 00:35:56.045]  They're coming in with more sanctions against Iran.
[00:35:56.165 --> 00:36:05.912]  Iran is scheduled in the next two weeks to load and fuel their reactors and to start purifying uranium.
[00:36:06.572 --> 00:36:22.183]  Now the UN inspectors have been there and they've said that they can't make weapons with this grade, but there's reportedly coming out next week an IAEA, International Atomic Energy Agency report, saying that Iran is secretly making fissile material.
[00:36:23.424 --> 00:36:26.605]  And Russia and China are protesting saying the report is a fraud.
[00:36:26.885 --> 00:36:28.466]  That was in the news last night and today.
[00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.087]  This is all happening right now.
[00:36:31.928 --> 00:36:35.070]  You've got the fake report of the guy wanting to blow up the Saudi embassy.
[00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:39.887]  And you had Congressman King and others saying, hit Iran.
[00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:40.948]  It's on.
[00:36:41.428 --> 00:36:42.949]  So stop living in denial.
[00:36:43.289 --> 00:36:47.952]  Why would the government COINTELPRO want to come out and say there's no danger of Iran being hit?
[00:36:48.412 --> 00:36:48.932]  Shut up.
[00:36:49.332 --> 00:36:50.253]  It's not happening.
[00:36:50.553 --> 00:36:51.294]  It's all made up.
[00:36:51.674 --> 00:36:55.056]  Even now, as the Israelis, and they were doing this two and a half weeks ago.
[00:36:55.736 --> 00:36:58.458]  Panetta, the Defense Secretary, came back and said they're getting ready to hit.
[00:36:59.478 --> 00:37:00.439]  They're probably going to hit them.
[00:37:00.459 --> 00:37:02.140]  They're totally diplomatically isolated.
[00:37:04.206 --> 00:37:10.512]  The Washington Times, who's pro-war, talks to insiders last Friday and says Netanyahu wants to be seen as Churchill.
[00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:12.815]  He's politically a dead duck right now.
[00:37:13.055 --> 00:37:14.296]  He's not going to get re-elected.
[00:37:14.516 --> 00:37:15.578]  This will get him re-elected.
[00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:25.142]  And they're all right here in the news, and again, it's not that I get lied about and people say, oh, you know, Jones is crazy just making it up that there's probably going to be an attack on Iran.
[00:37:25.442 --> 00:37:34.050]  I said the green light's been given, it's going to happen unless we expose this plot as a fraud of this Iranian car salesman in South Texas to do all this.
[00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.132]  Unless this is proven as a fraud now, they're going to use this to attack.
[00:37:38.534 --> 00:37:40.095]  And sure enough, it got proven as a fraud.
[00:37:40.355 --> 00:37:42.097]  So see, the government's doing two things here.
[00:37:42.697 --> 00:37:44.139]  The fact that I get attacked on this,
[00:37:45.939 --> 00:37:50.803]  It's not that it worries me that I'm being attacked over it, it shows me just how accurate we are.
[00:37:51.304 --> 00:37:57.168]  That they don't want Americans having a debate about the worst war yet of the five wars going on.
[00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:08.498]  So it's just, it's a military tactic, like when they're ramming into the Branch Davidians church with those tanks, and saying this is not an assault, come out with your hands up, and they ran out and they mowed them down.
[00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:13.122]  We have the flare footage of the guys behind the tanks, in an infantry tactic, just shooting them.
[00:38:14.087 --> 00:38:27.849]  And then running over their bodies and then bulldozing them with a Bradley fighting vehicle with a scoop on the front later back into the fire and the ATF and army posing with skulls and all the rest of it and blowing the little kids up inside the church records vault.
[00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:31.441]  That's the tactic, is we are not assaulting.
[00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:34.083]  So we're like, hey, you're getting troops ready.
[00:38:34.663 --> 00:38:36.925]  Israel's saying in their newspapers they're getting ready to hit.
[00:38:37.685 --> 00:38:38.065]  The U.S.
[00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:39.646]  is saying Israel don't attack.
[00:38:40.627 --> 00:38:44.230]  And they're moving troops into Kuwait, telling them there's about to be an attack.
[00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:49.751]  And now you've staged this thing saying Iran was going to do this, clearly as a fake provocation.
[00:38:50.051 --> 00:38:51.952]  Hey folks, they're green lighting the attack.
[00:38:52.252 --> 00:38:53.752]  We better get the word out and stop it.
[00:38:54.052 --> 00:39:01.254]  They want to deny this is getting ready to happen so you don't politically put pressure on Washington to stop this.
[00:39:03.294 --> 00:39:06.795]  They don't want to debate about hitting Iran or not hitting Iran.
[00:39:06.835 --> 00:39:08.135]  They just want us out of the game.
[00:39:08.175 --> 00:39:09.916]  They don't want Americans having a debate.
[00:39:11.124 --> 00:39:15.025]  Because we've already come three times in the last six, seven years within an inch.
[00:39:15.965 --> 00:39:28.589]  In 2007, Dick Cheney, now on record, and he admits it in his new book, ordered Fox Fallon, the head of CENTCOM, to attack, to attack, let me say this again, to attack
[00:39:29.529 --> 00:39:31.791]  Iran and he didn't do it and they had to resign.
[00:39:32.491 --> 00:39:38.955]  Then Cheney wanted to paint up blue patrol boats to attack US ships there in the Gulf as a pretext.
[00:39:38.975 --> 00:39:41.317]  This has all come out and the government said no again.
[00:39:41.637 --> 00:39:44.018]  So they're always trying to get this war going.
[00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:44.879]  Always trying.
[00:39:45.199 --> 00:39:46.900]  Iran's almost 80 million people.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.462]  They've got a lot more high-tech weapons than Iraq had.
[00:39:49.842 --> 00:39:56.887]  They weren't under decades and decades of sanctions and inspectors all over their country for 15 years and a bombed out nation.
[00:39:58.709 --> 00:39:59.890]  And it is going to wreak havoc.
[00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:02.272]  I mean, they're going to block the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:40:02.292 --> 00:40:03.593]  Oil prices are going to explode.
[00:40:03.873 --> 00:40:09.858]  It's going to be a political diversion for the banksters to steal more rights and more money and set up checkpoints.
[00:40:10.058 --> 00:40:14.061]  They're going to use the Iranian war threat to start setting up the domestic checkpoints.
[00:40:14.301 --> 00:40:22.928]  Notice they're rolling out the EAS takeover alert in November 9th.
[00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:28.392]  First time ever FEMA and Homeland Security totally take over the media, whether you like it or not.
[00:40:31.713 --> 00:40:40.638]  Notice they've got the TV ads, the PSAs, all the stuff rolling, TSA popping up on the street corners, telling you, you know, we're surveilling you.
[00:40:40.858 --> 00:40:44.440]  This is all being geared up and prepared for something big.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:51.904]  But the globalists aren't going to move with this plan if we have a debate about it and talk about it and point out how it's all a setup.
[00:40:52.404 --> 00:40:56.686]  So they just want to treat us like we're idiots and say there's no talk about hitting Iran.
[00:40:57.087 --> 00:41:00.408]  Anybody that says we're going to hit Iran is a crazy conspiracy terrorist.
[00:41:00.668 --> 00:41:06.291]  But wait a minute, Netanyahu's before the Knesset saying he's getting ready to hit and he's trying to get their support because it's a pretty big deal.
[00:41:07.692 --> 00:41:08.873]  No, he's not, Alex.
[00:41:08.893 --> 00:41:09.913]  Shut up, conspiracy terrorist.
[00:41:10.253 --> 00:41:11.434]  But wait, I have AP.
[00:41:12.094 --> 00:41:13.515]  I have Sky.
[00:41:13.535 --> 00:41:18.978]  I have London Guardian.
[00:41:19.138 --> 00:41:20.359]  They all say they're getting ready to hit.
[00:41:21.758 --> 00:41:22.158]  Right here.
[00:41:22.839 --> 00:41:25.401]  I was right again that they're moving to... And they're like, no!
[00:41:25.922 --> 00:41:27.183]  Iran doesn't even exist!
[00:41:29.104 --> 00:41:32.807]  I mean, that's basically the mind game they play with us.
[00:41:34.008 --> 00:41:35.349]  And that's what really scares me.
[00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:44.237]  Is if I would have come out two and a half weeks ago and said they're green-lighting an attack on Iran, any time, you know, two weeks out and then on from that point,
[00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:50.484]  If I wasn't credible, the system wouldn't even care.
[00:41:51.025 --> 00:41:53.927]  That's why I'm... We know they're getting ready to hit them now.
[00:41:53.947 --> 00:41:54.728]  I mean, they're admitting it.
[00:41:54.948 --> 00:41:56.009]  We know we've been proven right.
[00:41:56.249 --> 00:42:01.594]  So it's that we're so right, we're so accurate, we have our finger on the pulse of the geopolitical system.
[00:42:02.435 --> 00:42:04.116]  That's why we're bad.
[00:42:05.958 --> 00:42:08.320]  That's why we have to be demonized.
[00:42:09.108 --> 00:42:09.368]  U.K.
[00:42:09.388 --> 00:42:13.069]  military steps up plans for Iran attack amid fresh nuclear fears.
[00:42:13.569 --> 00:42:15.789]  And what do they say at the end of the Sky Television article?
[00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:16.750]  It says U.S.
[00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:20.190]  troops are being moved into Kuwait, as I told you two and a half weeks ago.
[00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:21.711]  It was not in the news at that time.
[00:42:23.051 --> 00:42:28.112]  I even told you they were going to try the invasion against Qaddafi, NATO-backed, in September, October.
[00:42:28.372 --> 00:42:29.232]  And of course it happened.
[00:42:30.173 --> 00:42:31.453]  Because I had military sources.
[00:42:32.355 --> 00:42:33.397]  And then you saw that happen.
[00:42:33.637 --> 00:42:37.003]  And then it got spun back and they said, Alex is crazy, U.S.
[00:42:37.023 --> 00:42:37.945]  troops were never on the ground.
[00:42:38.145 --> 00:42:39.307]  They were admittedly on the ground.
[00:42:39.928 --> 00:42:41.531]  See, Obama says U.S.
[00:42:41.551 --> 00:42:42.432]  troops were never on the ground.
[00:42:43.459 --> 00:42:43.759]  You know why?
[00:42:43.779 --> 00:42:45.360]  Because they were under NATO flag.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:49.142]  It's like saying our troops weren't in Bosnia, it was a UN operation.
[00:42:49.782 --> 00:42:51.163]  You see these little semantic games?
[00:42:51.523 --> 00:42:54.985]  It's kind of like Napolitano is now saying, I didn't perjure myself on Fast and Furious.
[00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:57.567]  We didn't call it that then, we called it Gunrunner.
[00:42:58.147 --> 00:43:03.070]  So I didn't lie when I said I didn't know about Fast and Furious, because we weren't calling it that yet.
[00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:04.810]  I knew about Gunrunner.
[00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.271]  But they said, you did this Gunrunning Fast and Furious.
[00:43:07.531 --> 00:43:08.711]  I know nothing about Gunrunning.
[00:43:08.891 --> 00:43:09.571]  Then she gets caught.
[00:43:09.871 --> 00:43:12.052]  Oh, I meant, I knew about Project Gunrunner.
[00:43:12.452 --> 00:43:13.872]  I didn't know about Fast and Furious.
[00:43:13.932 --> 00:43:15.852]  Same program, they just gave it another name.
[00:43:16.032 --> 00:43:18.213]  They play these games with you like you're an idiot.
[00:43:20.273 --> 00:43:24.854]  Because it does scare the system that we've got our hand on the pulse so closely.
[00:43:25.954 --> 00:43:27.534]  That we know what they're doing.
[00:43:27.794 --> 00:43:30.995]  I saw articles attacking us eight months ago.
[00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:40.496]  When we were predicting that they would use a ground rebel force in Libya next, and then call those the legitimate government and back it up with a NATO attack.
[00:43:41.176 --> 00:43:43.097]  I saw our articles in my videos.
[00:43:43.858 --> 00:43:44.298]  Where was it?
[00:43:44.318 --> 00:43:56.284]  I think it was on Little Green Football, one of the Neoton sites, attacking me at the time, going, look at this loon saying they're going to attack through proxies Libya.
[00:43:56.524 --> 00:43:58.846]  And then exactly what I said happened.
[00:43:59.753 --> 00:44:03.055]  That scares the system that I know what they're up to.
[00:44:04.095 --> 00:44:14.440]  Spending dozens of hours every day with all these top experts and guests, reading hundreds of news articles a day, poring over data and history and strategies and proxy warfare.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.441]  Obviously, this is not hard.
[00:44:16.481 --> 00:44:17.401]  It's all telegraphed.
[00:44:20.222 --> 00:44:21.423]  Okay, let's continue here now.
[00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:30.594]  You have just joined us during the kickoff of the 27-hour marathon transmission, second annual marathon transmission.
[00:44:31.074 --> 00:44:35.036]  I want to ask all listeners to go to InfoWars.com.
[00:44:35.516 --> 00:44:38.857]  In fact, we'll put this on screen.
[00:44:39.297 --> 00:44:48.701]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you will see there in the featured news area a link
[00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:51.152]  I need to restart my computer in here.
[00:44:51.172 --> 00:44:53.416]  I don't think it's been restarted in a week or two, and it's just not working.
[00:44:53.957 --> 00:44:55.239]  So I'm unable to use my computer.
[00:44:55.259 --> 00:44:56.521]  I need somebody to fix that for me.
[00:44:56.541 --> 00:44:57.282]  If you can, thank you.
[00:44:57.662 --> 00:44:59.325]  Or during the break, I can run over and do it, I guess.
[00:45:01.508 --> 00:45:01.709]  Great.
[00:45:03.263 --> 00:45:07.784]  But the point I'm here making is if you go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, that's the best place to find it.
[00:45:07.804 --> 00:45:09.864]  I was trying to tell you on InfoWars where it's at.
[00:45:10.144 --> 00:45:11.345]  Yeah, there's InfoWars.com.
[00:45:11.365 --> 00:45:20.146]  Scroll down, and then there's a link there that says InfoWars launches 24-hour plus offensive against tyranny.
[00:45:20.506 --> 00:45:31.729]  And if you scroll down there, you see our video feed of the next 27 hours, and then you see our other backup, and then you see our Justin TV, and you see our Ustream and other systems.
[00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:32.409]  And we've had
[00:45:33.792 --> 00:45:37.155]  Over a million people in one day before tune into the free streams.
[00:45:37.195 --> 00:45:43.080]  In a three day period we had 3.5 million during our Bilderberg coverage.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.743]  And obviously our servers can't handle millions of people tuning in.
[00:45:45.763 --> 00:45:51.668]  So if our servers go down, if those top links go down, you'll be able to watch on Justin.TV and Ustream and other areas.
[00:45:51.688 --> 00:45:56.833]  Though we did crash Justin.TV during that Bilderberg coverage in June.
[00:45:59.082 --> 00:46:00.703]  So that is all available there.
[00:46:00.803 --> 00:46:02.645]  Please get that link and share it with everyone.
[00:46:03.105 --> 00:46:06.848]  But really, the easiest place to find it is InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:46:07.188 --> 00:46:13.292]  If you go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, you see Live Feed 1, Live Feed 2, Live Feed 3.
[00:46:14.793 --> 00:46:16.634]  And then we have backup feeds under that.
[00:46:17.394 --> 00:46:25.077]  And you can check out the entire transmission right there and all these guests that are coming up.
[00:46:25.137 --> 00:46:25.797]  And who's coming up?
[00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:31.139]  Joel Skousen of World Affairs Brief to break down Iran, the economy, give us his view on that.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.281]  Webster Griffin Tarpley, geopolitical expert, will also be joining us.
[00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:35.061]  Katherine Albrecht,
[00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:38.865]  George Norrie, the icon, number two talk show host in the world.
[00:46:39.245 --> 00:46:41.447]  David Icke, needs no introduction.
[00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:46.172]  Mike Adams will end 5 to 7 central, sit in with a bunch of guests coming up so I can get a break.
[00:46:46.693 --> 00:46:49.035]  Then we have Alfred Adash joining us, always amazing.
[00:46:49.796 --> 00:46:53.821]  Tex Mars, we have Mr. Corbett joining us, always informative.
[00:46:54.641 --> 00:46:58.683]  We've got Fritz Springmeier fresh out of being a political prisoner joining us.
[00:46:59.163 --> 00:47:02.085]  Aaron Dykes then sits in for a couple hours, two to four.
[00:47:02.145 --> 00:47:04.906]  He's got some guests as well that are going to be very informative.
[00:47:05.186 --> 00:47:06.907]  Paul Watson then sits in for a couple hours.
[00:47:06.927 --> 00:47:07.747]  Then Richard Reeves.
[00:47:08.088 --> 00:47:09.568]  Then I'm back at 7 a.m.
[00:47:09.588 --> 00:47:11.809]  So I'll do 20 hours out of 27.
[00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:16.271]  And this says we're going to do the baggage video.
[00:47:16.331 --> 00:47:19.133]  No, I've told him I want to do, told him I want to do Izzerby.
[00:47:19.847 --> 00:47:22.472]  Begich is great, but this Isserby is breaking stuff.
[00:47:23.414 --> 00:47:24.797]  We may do the Begich later if we have time.
[00:47:24.837 --> 00:47:25.779]  That's a premiere video.
[00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:30.007]  Then Gerald Cilente joins me live, then Alan Watt, then...
[00:47:31.638 --> 00:47:33.299]  Jim Mars and then Bob Chapman.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:37.483]  So you talk about powerful 27-hour transmission.
[00:47:37.883 --> 00:47:48.912]  And if you're listening on AM and FM and want to be able to watch the show as well, just go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or InfoWars.com to find those free audio and video feeds.
[00:47:49.353 --> 00:47:53.536]  Also, you can get 15 days free at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, free trial subscription.
[00:47:54.637 --> 00:47:58.821]  And your memberships also support this truly alternative grassroots media organization.
[00:48:00.686 --> 00:48:02.688]  Now let me tell you why we're doing this money bomb.
[00:48:02.848 --> 00:48:03.849]  It's really elementary.
[00:48:05.771 --> 00:48:13.979]  It was listeners four years ago that had the idea for money bombs that helped move us into this bigger operation, buy more equipment, and spurred me to go to the next level.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.764]  And by doing that, we've been able to radically expand
[00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:21.800]  Our reach.
[00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:26.864]  Four years ago I was probably reaching five and a half, six million people a week total.
[00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:29.106]  It's 15 million conservatively.
[00:48:29.346 --> 00:48:31.848]  That's extremely conservative.
[00:48:31.868 --> 00:48:35.711]  15 million people a week.
[00:48:35.731 --> 00:48:36.412]  15 million.
[00:48:37.313 --> 00:48:42.457]  I have films seen online with over 35 million views per film.
[00:48:42.477 --> 00:48:43.418]  35 million.
[00:48:45.754 --> 00:48:47.155]  Who else is at this level?
[00:48:47.735 --> 00:48:50.257]  Who else is opposing the globalists at this level?
[00:48:50.677 --> 00:48:51.858]  Who else is exposing them?
[00:48:52.058 --> 00:48:53.279]  Who else understands them?
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:01.244]  Who else has this incredible spectrum of guests with different perspectives so you can come to your own decision like I do?
[00:49:02.805 --> 00:49:03.225]  Who else?
[00:49:03.866 --> 00:49:06.227]  We have to go to the next level and we have to be strong.
[00:49:06.507 --> 00:49:08.849]  In case, knock on wood, we get sued.
[00:49:10.293 --> 00:49:13.595]  In case I get killed or imprisoned, this operation's got to continue.
[00:49:13.875 --> 00:49:17.577]  I'm trying to groom the reporters, the researchers, the people that know what they're doing.
[00:49:18.197 --> 00:49:20.299]  I've got a plan in place if something happens to me.
[00:49:20.579 --> 00:49:23.780]  Believe me, I take the threat serious.
[00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:24.841]  These are criminals we're fighting.
[00:49:26.922 --> 00:49:27.943]  So it's very simple.
[00:49:28.523 --> 00:49:31.605]  And we've got some reserve backup capital.
[00:49:33.171 --> 00:49:43.674]  To try to run this operation regardless, but to hire a couple of reporters and a second line of people to help us on the nightly news show.
[00:49:44.514 --> 00:49:46.635]  And I quite frankly think we need one more person in the radio area.
[00:49:46.675 --> 00:49:48.995]  We got two people, but when emergencies come up, we're short-handed.
[00:49:49.015 --> 00:49:50.396]  We got one person right now.
[00:49:50.416 --> 00:49:52.896]  And we're gonna do that too.
[00:49:52.916 --> 00:49:54.217]  We're gonna get one more person in the radio.
[00:49:54.237 --> 00:49:54.697]  We need that.
[00:49:54.717 --> 00:49:56.217]  I'm making that decision right now.
[00:49:56.937 --> 00:49:58.978]  But the issue is that
[00:50:00.396 --> 00:50:04.157]  We need to get the personnel, we need some equipment, and so we're trying to raise $500,000.
[00:50:04.217 --> 00:50:11.639]  Sounds like a lot when you're running a big operation, when you actually run something with 30-plus people, you find out it's not jack squat.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:15.320]  It's a lot, though, for a country falling apart.
[00:50:15.661 --> 00:50:23.403]  But look, when you give to Ron Paul and you give to alternative media, when you buy organic food, you are voting with your dollars.
[00:50:24.663 --> 00:50:26.864]  And other revolutionaries rob banks.
[00:50:28.983 --> 00:50:29.383]  I don't know.
[00:50:41.351 --> 00:50:45.975]  Get the public to give to all their anti-gun charities and things and to NPR and things.
[00:50:46.275 --> 00:50:47.296]  Why shouldn't we?
[00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:48.396]  That's another thing.
[00:50:48.416 --> 00:50:51.659]  They don't like me talking about a strike on Iran and they hate this money bomb.
[00:50:51.999 --> 00:50:53.340]  Not just because of Alex Jones.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:51:01.006]  They don't like the idea of people giving to patriot political causes because if you did give across the board, we'd beat these people.
[00:51:01.426 --> 00:51:06.472]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next disaster hits?
[00:51:06.772 --> 00:51:12.999]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after a big disaster strikes!
[00:51:13.159 --> 00:51:17.504]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now!
[00:51:17.985 --> 00:51:21.549]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video
[00:51:21.989 --> 00:51:27.376]  Inside information on the 37 food items that will sell out first when the next disaster strikes.
[00:51:27.396 --> 00:51:36.527]  The video on 123survivalplan.com has crucial information you and your family need to prepare for any disaster, natural or man-made.
[00:51:36.847 --> 00:51:41.513]  And you won't have to be afraid of going hungry or being sent to a FEMA refugee camp.
[00:51:41.733 --> 00:51:46.877]  See the video that over one million other smart patriots have already seen in the last four months.
[00:51:47.138 --> 00:51:48.038]  Prepare now.
[00:51:48.379 --> 00:51:53.983]  Go to 123survivalplan.com and learn which 37 food items you should hoard.
[00:51:54.243 --> 00:51:55.024]  Easy to remember.

[00:51:55.625 --> 00:51:56.906]  Again, that's 123survivalplan.com.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:02.960]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[00:54:27.603 --> 00:54:29.404]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:54:29.464 --> 00:54:30.404]  I am fired up!
[00:54:30.964 --> 00:54:33.705]  Getting ready for this 27-hour transmission!
[00:54:34.266 --> 00:54:39.527]  Joel Skelton coming up to break down his perspective, his view on world events.
[00:54:40.908 --> 00:54:43.509]  Then we got Webster Tarpley joining us and a lot more today.
[00:54:44.049 --> 00:54:46.650]  But getting back to this money bomb, the idea
[00:54:48.416 --> 00:55:13.362]  The idea of people giving, the idea of people all in, like in my mother's side of the family, William Ayers, selling his land in New York and buying a ship full of Bibles, very expensive, he was a wealthy man, and coming to Texas to preach the gospel, but he believed in protestantism as a protestant because he didn't like the fact that everybody was being forced to convert to Catholicism.
[00:55:13.802 --> 00:55:15.022]  That helped create
[00:55:15.202 --> 00:55:18.366]  Texas today, and I'm not getting into some Catholic-Protestant fight here.
[00:55:18.666 --> 00:55:21.069]  I'm just saying history's made by people that take action.
[00:55:21.409 --> 00:55:23.351]  History's made by people that step into the gap.
[00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:25.354]  People who step up and take action.
[00:55:25.634 --> 00:55:27.936]  And that's what I've done in the last 17 years.
[00:55:30.319 --> 00:55:34.561]  And I want to thank all of you that have donated at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[00:55:34.921 --> 00:55:36.562]  We've raised over $60,000 now.
[00:55:36.602 --> 00:55:48.529]  We need to get all the way up to $500,000 by the end of the show tomorrow in this 27-hour transmission money bomb to be able to continue to expand our operation at the levels we need to.
[00:55:49.449 --> 00:55:51.992]  And to buy the equipment we need to.
[00:55:52.992 --> 00:55:58.898]  Go watch the videos of what we've built in the last three and a half, four years, thanks to your support.
[00:55:59.258 --> 00:56:07.065]  It allowed us to not gamble as much and to be able, by gamble I mean hire people and then go bankrupt.
[00:56:07.365 --> 00:56:10.688]  It allowed us to grow and to be safe about that growth.
[00:56:11.529 --> 00:56:13.491]  Because I don't want to be reckless with this operation.
[00:56:14.989 --> 00:56:21.948]  Okay, because it's such an important research facility, a system for reaching out to people.
[00:56:23.055 --> 00:56:25.577]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:25.617 --> 00:56:29.060]  You can support us by getting a PrisonPlanet.TV membership.
[00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.922]  You get 15 days, anyways right now, free.
[00:56:32.862 --> 00:56:35.444]  You support us by going to InfoWarsMoneyBomb and donating.
[00:56:36.005 --> 00:56:47.674]  Again, think about the fact that NPR gets up there, though it's government-funded and Rockefeller-funded, listen to who funds it, and then they also beg for money three or four times a year, every day.
[00:56:48.948 --> 00:56:53.672]  So they can sit there and put out anti-family, anti-gun, anti-freedom garbage.
[00:56:54.812 --> 00:56:58.775]  Now there's some good PBS facilities in the country run by good people.
[00:56:59.696 --> 00:57:01.818]  So I'm not even trying to bash public television.
[00:57:01.838 --> 00:57:03.399]  I've actually seen some good out of that.
[00:57:03.799 --> 00:57:12.586]  But the point is they still have government funding and then big mega-banker funding, foundation funding, and then viewers like you.
[00:57:13.749 --> 00:57:14.810]  So it's very elementary.
[00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:20.916]  If you believe in what we're doing and you believe it's good to give to a cause of waking people up, please donate.
[00:57:20.956 --> 00:57:26.561]  But listen, I do not want little old ladies who aren't doing well to give me one dime.
[00:57:26.922 --> 00:57:29.764]  I don't want young people who aren't doing well to give me anything.
[00:57:30.145 --> 00:57:31.226]  Spread the word about the show.
[00:57:31.246 --> 00:57:32.507]  Spread the word about the information.
[00:57:32.707 --> 00:57:33.668]  That's the most important thing.
[00:57:33.908 --> 00:57:38.593]  Spread the word about this transmission that's taking place right now for 27 hours straight.
[00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:48.477]  But for those of you that own businesses, those of you who don't like collectivism and tyranny and the banksters, who else is going to call for the arrest of the banksters?
[00:57:48.957 --> 00:57:51.019]  Who else is going to really point out what's happening?
[00:57:51.299 --> 00:57:53.041]  Who else is going to expose the system?
[00:57:53.361 --> 00:57:56.323]  Who else is going to expose the left-right paradigm and how they operate?
[00:57:56.564 --> 00:58:00.627]  Who else is going to give you results like you've seen here with the Infowars family?
[00:58:02.005 --> 00:58:13.135]  So I'm going to tell you right now, go to Infowarsmoneybomb.com if you want to make us stronger, if you want to see us grow even faster, if you want to see us expand what we're doing.
[00:58:13.195 --> 00:58:15.117]  We are doing the best job we can.
[00:58:15.677 --> 00:58:17.279]  We are busting our hind ends.
[00:58:17.339 --> 00:58:19.621]  I didn't leave here until 9.30 last night.
[00:58:21.381 --> 00:58:22.222]  And you know what?
[00:58:22.262 --> 00:58:24.264]  I'm not even seeing my family hardly now these days.
[00:58:24.284 --> 00:58:25.105]  But you know what?
[00:58:25.165 --> 00:58:29.328]  It's worth it because they have no future if we don't do this.
[00:58:29.408 --> 00:58:32.070]  So, spread the word about InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:58:32.271 --> 00:58:34.893]  Tell folks about the incredible 27-hour transmission.
[00:58:34.933 --> 00:58:38.996]  Spread that link out to everybody and donate now at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:58:39.036 --> 00:58:47.764]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.025 --> 00:59:06.499]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:11.184]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:12.185 --> 00:59:24.196]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:59:24.957 --> 00:59:32.223]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:59:32.904 --> 00:59:42.510]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:59:43.271 --> 00:59:46.553]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.

[00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:55.959]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.439 --> 00:59:59.161]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.751 --> 01:00:06.372]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.052 --> 01:00:08.093]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:09.974]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.594 --> 01:00:11.415]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:13.096]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.716 --> 01:00:17.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.919 --> 01:00:21.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:41.512]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[01:00:41.973 --> 01:00:43.353]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:43.393 --> 01:00:45.435]  Joel Skousen coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.156]  We got Webster Griffin Carpley coming on.
[01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:50.557]  We're going to get into all this incredible police state geopolitical news.
[01:00:51.058 --> 01:00:52.899]  All of it is coming up now.
[01:00:54.468 --> 01:01:06.556]  Continuing here today, we're having the fourth annual money bomb, which is added treasure, as the founding fathers would say, to fund our info war against the globalists.
[01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:13.480]  You know, a couple of their Hellfire missiles cost a half million dollars that they're dropping on people.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:21.705]  And the government takes your money, forces you to then give it to their systems, which are given to offshore banks.
[01:01:21.785 --> 01:01:22.826]  They don't give you a choice.
[01:01:24.124 --> 01:01:24.905]  We give you a choice.
[01:01:24.965 --> 01:01:33.510]  If you want to give your money in a place where it has more bang for its buck than anywhere else, then it's InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just go to InfoWars.com.
[01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:35.992]  There's a big giant banner on the top of the screen.
[01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:42.516]  You click on that and it takes you over there to the site where you can donate on PayPal, credit card, you name it.
[01:01:42.997 --> 01:01:43.337]  Also,
[01:01:44.912 --> 01:01:47.114]  I was going to do a bunch of pen and inks and even some acrylic.
[01:01:47.754 --> 01:01:49.216]  And I got so busy I never did it.
[01:01:49.356 --> 01:01:58.023]  But, during my two hour break tonight when Mike Adams is doing the show, I'm going to have him go over to Hobby Lobby or wherever and get me the art supplies.
[01:01:58.043 --> 01:01:59.224]  The problem is I know what I need.
[01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:01.727]  And maybe I'll just run over there.
[01:02:03.047 --> 01:02:05.829]  And, uh, just because it's an idea, I've always wanted to do it.
[01:02:05.849 --> 01:02:11.614]  Just some fast, quick paintings of different things, some political stuff, and then we're going to sell those on the eBay.
[01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:15.597]  There's a big link at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com to our eBay selection.
[01:02:15.857 --> 01:02:16.918]  It's got Tyranny Crusher 2.
[01:02:17.018 --> 01:02:20.101]  We've actually used this for more than two years.
[01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:23.083]  It says on the eBay, we've been using it for two years.
[01:02:24.144 --> 01:02:25.405]  Actually, this was my spare.
[01:02:25.785 --> 01:02:27.046]  We've had this, I think, five years.
[01:02:28.047 --> 01:02:33.249]  And the other one got broken four years ago at the DNC when the MSNBC people attacked me with a knife.
[01:02:33.769 --> 01:02:35.130]  And it's all on video and cut it.
[01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:36.330]  This is Tyranny Crusher 2.
[01:02:36.550 --> 01:02:41.272]  It's been used for five years off and on, totally in the last three and a half, four years.
[01:02:41.572 --> 01:02:43.873]  And it's signed by me, yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:02:44.273 --> 01:02:45.974]  And it has the 2011 on it.
[01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:50.315]  And it says TC2, Tyranny Crusher 2 on it.
[01:02:50.655 --> 01:02:53.056]  It's also got a pig on it that says In The Fed.
[01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:55.257]  And this is up there for bid.
[01:02:56.897 --> 01:03:08.744]  Right now, on the eBay site, we got a bunch of other... We printed out a bunch of Obama Deception, Fall of the Republic color printouts to cover the wall with them to shoot promo videos for the films.
[01:03:09.004 --> 01:03:12.446]  And they've hung here in the office for three years and a year and a half, respectively.
[01:03:12.806 --> 01:03:16.929]  We're now signing those, I'm signing those, and pulling them down off the wall.
[01:03:17.169 --> 01:03:18.549]  So we're now pulling them down off the wall.
[01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.150]  We're gonna be, I mean, whatever.
[01:03:20.351 --> 01:03:25.834]  Whatever raises capital so that I can hire four or five more people and buy some more equipment.
[01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:40.620]  And because, again, with the Nightly News, I need to hire at least two or three more people to have a second string to be trained so that when people go on vacation, when things happen, so that we basically have that cushion.
[01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:42.141]  It's not even a cushion.
[01:03:42.161 --> 01:03:43.402]  You have to have it or you go crazy.
[01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:46.405]  That's why I'm grooming Aaron into the Nightly News some.
[01:03:46.845 --> 01:03:49.327]  Mike Adams also does a great job, comes in some and does it.
[01:03:50.147 --> 01:03:57.311]  Uh, I'm trying to get McBreen, who's a really smart, good guy, great reporter, to also do the nightly news sometimes, to where I'm doing it about four nights a week and somebody else is doing it one night a week.
[01:03:58.172 --> 01:04:00.293]  Uh, because I also then have a plan to start other shows.
[01:04:00.313 --> 01:04:05.356]  I want to start a shooting show, uh, maybe even five nights a week, about the Second Amendment.
[01:04:05.416 --> 01:04:07.377]  I-I-I got all these ideas I want to launch.
[01:04:08.718 --> 01:04:10.118]  And if we build it, they will come.
[01:04:10.178 --> 01:04:10.759]  You have come.
[01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:11.779]  We've done incredible things.
[01:04:11.799 --> 01:04:17.381]  But in the face of this new world order onslaught, I know that it is my responsibility to do even more.
[01:04:17.881 --> 01:04:18.601]  And that's what I'm doing.
[01:04:18.761 --> 01:04:19.961]  And you understand that.
[01:04:20.001 --> 01:04:20.802]  You resonate with that.
[01:04:20.842 --> 01:04:21.502]  You realize that.
[01:04:21.522 --> 01:04:26.443]  If you want to be part of this incredible historical thing we're doing together, donate today.
[01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:28.264]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:04:28.444 --> 01:04:32.145]  But even more important, for this 27-hour transmission, get that link.
[01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:47.696]  To InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and send to everybody and say there is a 27 hour broadcast happening here or send them the InfoWars link that we've got as well because it's so important to get this out to people.
[01:04:47.976 --> 01:04:52.860]  It is so important that they know this is coming up and we're already into the second hour of it.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:53.780]  Stay with us.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:54.461]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:01.144 --> 01:05:02.366]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:02.746 --> 01:05:08.553]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[01:05:09.034 --> 01:05:12.659]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[01:05:13.079 --> 01:05:17.705]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious
[01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:18.125]  I think so.
[01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:33.663]  We're good to go.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:06.801]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:12.803]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:06:13.183 --> 01:06:20.204]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:06:21.905 --> 01:06:24.085]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:06:25.985 --> 01:06:27.926]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:06:40.071 --> 01:06:41.952]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:06:42.212 --> 01:06:43.713]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:43.993 --> 01:06:46.554]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:06:46.874 --> 01:06:50.936]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[01:06:51.116 --> 01:06:53.137]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:06:53.497 --> 01:06:55.698]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:06:56.198 --> 01:06:57.639]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:06:57.799 --> 01:06:58.239]  Got it.
[01:06:58.579 --> 01:06:59.080]  Others don't.
[01:07:04.853 --> 01:07:05.773]  Tyranny is here.
[01:07:06.113 --> 01:07:09.754]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:07:09.974 --> 01:07:12.274]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:07:12.434 --> 01:07:17.715]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:24.396]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:07:24.796 --> 01:07:30.357]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:07:30.777 --> 01:07:34.478]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:38.942]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:07:39.242 --> 01:07:44.767]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:07:45.188 --> 01:07:48.151]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:50.172]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:51.233]  It's here.

[01:08:02.205 --> 01:08:04.407]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.427 --> 01:08:07.889]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.255 --> 01:08:23.899]  We are now into hour number two of the 27-hour live transmission.
[01:08:25.721 --> 01:08:27.902]  It's the fourth annual InfoWars.com
[01:08:30.017 --> 01:08:32.719]  Money Bomb to buy equipment and hire more personnel.
[01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:35.741]  You've seen the nightly news we've launched in the beta testing phase.
[01:08:36.101 --> 01:08:40.884]  Now we're going to start moving it into syndication to select cable and TV systems that want it.
[01:08:41.124 --> 01:08:43.846]  It won't be like a big national show on one big giant network.
[01:08:43.866 --> 01:08:48.309]  We'll have to deliver it here and there, but we've already got folks in different parts of the world and here in the U.S.
[01:08:48.389 --> 01:08:48.970]  ready to get it.
[01:08:49.030 --> 01:08:56.795]  Some TV stations already grabbing the internet stream or downloading the higher quality file after it's over every night and airing it, like down in Houston, Texas.
[01:08:56.835 --> 01:08:59.437]  I need to create a whole list of where we're on as well.
[01:09:00.598 --> 01:09:08.326]  We have the syndicated radio show, we have the films we make, we have the news websites, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:08.927 --> 01:09:12.551]  It has been my goal to start an internet TV network for a decade.
[01:09:12.952 --> 01:09:15.775]  And now you see it proliferating because the technology has gotten here.
[01:09:16.175 --> 01:09:36.340]  We've been streaming this radio show out as a type of television show with videos and documents and articles and guests, but now we're moving even deeper into that with reporters, investigative journalists, people flying all over the country, doing dozens of interviews a month via Skype, several a month in person, traveling around the country.
[01:09:37.828 --> 01:09:44.434]  We are moving into the next level, and it's the book sales, the video sales, the sponsors that make this show possible.
[01:09:44.474 --> 01:09:49.019]  But also, listeners four years ago had the idea for a money bomb.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:55.465]  And I was like, no, I'm just going to stay here at my little 4,000 square foot office, make films, do the radio show.
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.402]  But they got all these people to pledge, and all these donations came in, so I said, okay.
[01:10:02.442 --> 01:10:09.805]  And that pushed us to do what we've now done, and gave me the idea to really try to grow, in the face of the globalists, to give it all I can.
[01:10:10.405 --> 01:10:11.025]  And we've done that.
[01:10:11.065 --> 01:10:13.726]  You know, most revolutionaries rob banks to fund themselves.
[01:10:14.006 --> 01:10:15.887]  Well, I'm not a revolutionary, I'm a restorationist.
[01:10:16.187 --> 01:10:23.030]  I want our republic, the rule of law, common law, the constitution that our forebearers set up, I want that back.
[01:10:24.341 --> 01:10:30.206]  And, but I noticed when they were doing the money bomb four years ago, the COINTELPRO operatives screamed with anger.
[01:10:30.987 --> 01:10:40.715]  Because it's not just attacking Alex Jones, the idea of patriots, constitutionalists, libertarians, Christians, giving money to anti-New World Order groups.
[01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:47.315]  That idea frightens the New World Order because they got all the rich and powerful to pull their money to set up world government.
[01:10:47.955 --> 01:10:56.503]  They got your tax money on top of Rockefeller money and on top of begging locally to fund all this NPR to push anti-gun, anti-family trash.
[01:10:57.003 --> 01:10:58.244]  They've set up their own system.
[01:10:58.464 --> 01:11:04.470]  They have United Way and others raise billions of dollars on 9-11 and then keep half the money and spend most of it on gun control.
[01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:09.292]  See, that's why the system screams in anger.
[01:11:09.833 --> 01:11:12.054]  Just like 10 years ago, you couldn't buy organic food anywhere.
[01:11:12.354 --> 01:11:13.415]  Going to Joel Scowls in a moment.
[01:11:13.675 --> 01:11:14.956]  You couldn't buy organic food anywhere.
[01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:18.439]  Now, because people wanted it in the market, it's displacing the garbage.
[01:11:18.839 --> 01:11:20.780]  People won't buy milk now with, uh...
[01:11:21.801 --> 01:11:23.902]  The bovine synthetic hormone in it.
[01:11:24.522 --> 01:11:25.742]  You see, it's happening.
[01:11:26.002 --> 01:11:27.322]  We're voting with our dollars.
[01:11:27.582 --> 01:11:36.344]  When you spread the word about InfoWars.com, when you go to InfoWars.com and get the video links, because we're streaming all this out for free right now, the next 27 hours, and send that out to others.
[01:11:37.185 --> 01:11:46.967]  We sent folks to Bilderberg, and just on Justin.TV, in three and a half days, we had 3.5 million views on one little channel we just set up.
[01:11:49.426 --> 01:11:54.989]  Not just the three million that tune into this show every day, three million extra, just on one little internet system.
[01:11:56.589 --> 01:11:59.971]  Bill O'Reilly's the king of TV because he has two million viewers every night.
[01:12:01.251 --> 01:12:02.252]  They're paper tigers.
[01:12:03.593 --> 01:12:04.333]  That's my point.
[01:12:04.393 --> 01:12:08.015]  We've reached 300 million people in the last two and a half years on YouTube alone.
[01:12:08.035 --> 01:12:13.797]  By the way, we've now caught them with Ron Paul and myself, not letting our new videos be searchable, but Obama's are.
[01:12:15.018 --> 01:12:16.578]  Oh yeah, there's something going on at YouTube right now.
[01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:17.439]  You can check it for yourself.
[01:12:18.732 --> 01:12:23.055]  There's all sorts of things going on that are very sneaky because the system's scared.
[01:12:23.075 --> 01:12:25.017]  They're coming out saying they want to start censoring the web.
[01:12:25.337 --> 01:12:26.498]  In England, they're calling for it.
[01:12:26.718 --> 01:12:33.023]  They have this piracy bill that even members of Congress say will end the web as we know it, in due process.
[01:12:33.403 --> 01:12:37.226]  They're getting ready to launch a false flag on the web to try to start cracking down on it more.
[01:12:38.907 --> 01:12:39.788]  It's all coming down.
[01:12:39.828 --> 01:12:43.451]  We need to energize the alternative media now more than ever.
[01:12:44.728 --> 01:12:52.796]  Quite frankly, I could probably run around and add more ads to the show and do stuff and fund our growth, but people like a chance to give.
[01:12:52.936 --> 01:13:00.524]  And the fact that the system is so scared of this and comes out of the woodwork when we talk about a money bomb and a taxes, that shows I need to be doing this.
[01:13:00.804 --> 01:13:01.565]  Perhaps more.
[01:13:02.205 --> 01:13:04.547]  Also, support our local AM and FM affiliates.
[01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.831]  If you're a local business, sponsor the stations I'm on.
[01:13:08.894 --> 01:13:12.076]  If you're listing a local station, call them.
[01:13:12.176 --> 01:13:12.636]  Thank them.
[01:13:13.077 --> 01:13:14.137]  Thank their sponsors.
[01:13:14.878 --> 01:13:24.063]  Put your money where your mouth is, like our founders did when they pledged their names, their honor, their treasure, their family, their sacred honor.
[01:13:24.563 --> 01:13:26.024]  All of it on the cause.
[01:13:26.225 --> 01:13:29.727]  All we're doing in the InfoWar is saying, spread the word about us, support us.
[01:13:30.587 --> 01:13:32.869]  Donate at Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[01:13:33.069 --> 01:13:36.533]  Got a lot of items up at eBay, too, and the auction that also support us.
[01:13:36.553 --> 01:13:37.994]  I'm going to add some more stuff there today.
[01:13:38.394 --> 01:13:42.258]  It's all at Infowars.com or Infowarsmoneybomb.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:49.875]  Coming up in the next 47 minutes or so, we're going to get into Israel considers preemptive attack on Iran.
[01:13:50.475 --> 01:13:51.676]  Is this more saber-rattling?
[01:13:52.797 --> 01:13:54.538]  They've hit Iraq before.
[01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:57.661]  They hit Syria three years ago, hit one of their nuclear facilities.
[01:13:58.141 --> 01:13:59.822]  In 1981, they hit Iraq.
[01:14:00.343 --> 01:14:02.664]  Netanyahu's asking for permission right now in the Cabinet.
[01:14:02.805 --> 01:14:03.665]  They're arguing about it.
[01:14:04.346 --> 01:14:05.907]  And I've got family in the military and others.
[01:14:05.927 --> 01:14:09.329]  They say they've been told it's going to happen, that Israel's going to attack and the U.S.
[01:14:09.369 --> 01:14:09.750]  will have to
[01:14:10.931 --> 01:14:13.512]  Mop it up or have, you know, anti-missile cruisers in the area.
[01:14:14.192 --> 01:14:15.392]  But that doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[01:14:15.412 --> 01:14:16.633]  If we get the word out, we can stop it.
[01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:18.053]  I want to get Joel Scalza's take on that.
[01:14:18.693 --> 01:14:20.974]  I want to get his take on the economy.
[01:14:21.514 --> 01:14:35.879]  I want to get his take on what's happening in the White House, Fast and Furious, this accelerated rollout of EAS alert, first-time takeover, November 9th, where the government's going to take over all the communications for the first time without stations voluntarily going over to it.
[01:14:37.245 --> 01:15:01.423]  I want to get into all of this with Joel Scalzen, but coming up, Scalzen, Tarpley, Albrecht, Norrie, Ike, Adams, Robert Scott Bell, so many others, Corbett, Tex Mars, we've got Jim Mars, Bob Chapman, Richard Reeves, Aaron Dykes, Fritz Springmeier, Paul Joseph Watson, and others.
[01:15:01.443 --> 01:15:03.905]  And we're going to premiere a Skull and Bones video.
[01:15:04.545 --> 01:15:06.866]  Here, with Charlottesville, never before seen.
[01:15:06.906 --> 01:15:09.027]  We aired part one earlier in the year.
[01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:11.248]  It took us this long to get it together and edit the new part.
[01:15:11.568 --> 01:15:13.929]  And it's stuff never before seen or heard, some of this stuff.
[01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:14.709]  Okay?
[01:15:14.729 --> 01:15:16.650]  I know Aaron's been staying up for two days to finish it.
[01:15:18.471 --> 01:15:20.211]  Point is, that's all coming up today.
[01:15:20.632 --> 01:15:21.112]  All here.
[01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:23.613]  And the free video streams are at Infowars.com.
[01:15:23.873 --> 01:15:25.454]  Get them, get that out to everybody.
[01:15:25.474 --> 01:15:27.915]  That's how you can donate right there, is just spreading the word.
[01:15:28.715 --> 01:15:29.975]  And I see the donations are pouring in.
[01:15:29.995 --> 01:15:31.236]  Let me give you the number, then we're going to Joel.
[01:15:32.637 --> 01:15:32.737]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:32.757 --> 01:15:34.519]  If you want to call in and donate.
[01:15:34.539 --> 01:15:34.579]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:34.599 --> 01:15:34.639]  888-253-3139.
[01:15:34.679 --> 01:15:36.181]  We got 8 people back there to take your calls.
[01:15:36.201 --> 01:15:37.662]  They're going to be there throughout the night.
[01:15:37.682 --> 01:15:38.883]  And I'm going to be up.
[01:15:38.964 --> 01:15:40.725]  I'm going to go to sleep at 2 until about 5.
[01:15:40.805 --> 01:15:42.727]  I'm going to get up, read more of the news at 5.
[01:15:53.138 --> 01:15:58.362]  Take a shower and stuff, and then I'll be back, you know, on the air, of course, until the show ends tomorrow at two o'clock.
[01:15:58.382 --> 01:15:59.122]  That's 27 hours.
[01:15:59.463 --> 01:16:04.026]  But live overnight for those four or five hours, we're gonna have Watson and Aaron Dykes with some guests.
[01:16:04.046 --> 01:16:04.787]  You don't want to miss that.
[01:16:05.087 --> 01:16:05.447]  So again, 888-253-3139.
[01:16:05.467 --> 01:16:06.708]  It's the fourth annual InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:16:11.131 --> 01:16:17.879]  The idea of the restorationists using the free market and your free will donating to build this.
[01:16:18.019 --> 01:16:22.944]  We're not like the government that takes your money and then bail out money and then gives it to MSNBC secretly.
[01:16:23.244 --> 01:16:23.905]  That's now come out.
[01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:25.066]  We don't do that.
[01:16:25.387 --> 01:16:27.349]  We're saying, if you believe in this, donate to us.
[01:16:27.409 --> 01:16:32.514]  Now, going to the balance of the hour and a little bit of the next, if we can do it, because TARP is coming up at 8 after.
[01:16:33.749 --> 01:16:36.791]  We're joined by Joel Skousen, a political scientist by training.
[01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:40.754]  He, of course, was also a fighter pilot.
[01:16:40.974 --> 01:16:45.797]  We've gone over his bio many, many times here on air.
[01:16:47.279 --> 01:16:53.843]  And he is a world-renowned expert on strategic relocation, I guess, bunker housing type systems.
[01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:55.885]  He publishes the World Affairs Brief.
[01:16:56.225 --> 01:16:57.266]  We also sell his book.
[01:16:57.286 --> 01:17:00.828]  It's one of our bestsellers, Strategic Relocation, the latest edition.
[01:17:00.888 --> 01:17:01.148]  I don't know.
[01:17:25.759 --> 01:17:26.920]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.023]  It's really a privilege to be on this very worthy cause, and thanks for the call.
[01:17:33.304 --> 01:17:35.606]  Things are really starting to move rapidly.
[01:17:35.726 --> 01:17:42.771]  One of the key elements that I saw was this decision to pull out of Iraq when they had no intention of pulling out.
[01:17:42.851 --> 01:17:52.298]  They were really stymied by the Iraqi opposition, but I think this Iran war is going to be there, and it's the only reason I can see why they're pushing up
[01:17:52.998 --> 01:18:07.298]  All of this propaganda, which lets the Iranians know this is coming very, very soon, and sacrificing military secrecy, which normally accompanies a preemptive strike, so it's a surprise.
[01:18:08.271 --> 01:18:19.455]  We'll talk a little bit more about the background I have on what I think the various parties are up to on this, but we are facing a major crisis right now in the economy because of the European debt situation.
[01:18:19.475 --> 01:18:26.557]  Greece has thrown a monkey wrench into the European debt resolution and bailout.
[01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.858]  The markets are responding extremely negatively.
[01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:40.787]  I think what's coming up that we really need to look at and talk about is what's coming up in November when the super committee brings out its report relative to
[01:18:42.403 --> 01:18:45.804]  The cuts that they're going to propose, I don't think Congress is going to be able to vote for those cuts.
[01:18:45.824 --> 01:19:02.251]  The automatic cuts will then trigger in, and I think this Occupy Wall Street movement, even though it's beneficial to our movement in the sense that it's attacking Wall Street, it is a leftist-based organization, and I think that they're going to trigger a great deal of
[01:19:03.692 --> 01:19:08.057]  Extreme violence and other further unrest when these automatic trigger cuts come in.
[01:19:08.137 --> 01:19:20.111]  So far, they really haven't got the wherewithal to do a major escalation of these demonstrations until that November report comes out.
[01:19:20.151 --> 01:19:21.293]  So that's coming up this month.
[01:19:25.418 --> 01:19:28.421]  Well, Joel, that's extremely interesting, and I concur with your breakdown.
[01:19:28.821 --> 01:19:30.583]  Let's go through all of this on the other side.
[01:19:30.623 --> 01:19:34.086]  We've got Joel joining us via Skype from his home.
[01:19:34.746 --> 01:19:40.852]  We may go to telephone here in a moment, though, because his audio is really, really low for radio listeners out there.
[01:19:41.573 --> 01:19:43.855]  But this will be important information, obviously, straight ahead.
[01:19:44.295 --> 01:19:47.138]  My sources are Israel is planning to attack Iran.
[01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:48.839]  And I said that two and a half weeks ago.
[01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.981]  Now you see them openly saying they want to.
[01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:52.322]  So we're proving right again.
[01:19:52.342 --> 01:19:56.166]  And we'll get Joel's take on all of this on the other side.
[01:19:56.206 --> 01:19:57.387]  We could still stop it though.
[01:19:57.868 --> 01:20:00.910]  Or we'll get Joel's take on it if he thinks we can still stop it.
[01:20:01.211 --> 01:20:04.954]  Hey guys, are weaker testosterone levels taking you out of the game?
[01:20:05.194 --> 01:20:06.155]  Are you gaining fat?
[01:20:06.295 --> 01:20:07.056]  Feeling tired?
[01:20:07.256 --> 01:20:09.078]  Losing desire in the bedroom?
[01:20:09.338 --> 01:20:10.719]  Get back in the game!
[01:20:10.999 --> 01:20:20.507]  Call now for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.
[01:20:20.808 --> 01:20:22.569]  No injections, no appointments.
[01:20:22.809 --> 01:20:27.153]  Just take Ageless Male every day and boost your testosterone by 61%.
[01:20:28.614 --> 01:20:32.838]  When your levels are healthy, you can feel energy again, a great outlook again,
[01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.959]  And yes, a healthy sex drive.
[01:20:35.219 --> 01:20:37.201]  The results are life-changing.
[01:20:37.521 --> 01:20:39.002]  Beware of cheap knockoffs.
[01:20:39.222 --> 01:20:46.206]  Ageless Male is an exclusive formula and the only one proven in research to boost testosterone 61%.
[01:20:47.026 --> 01:20:49.068]  Try Ageless Male, risk-free.
[01:20:49.408 --> 01:20:49.948]  Just call 1-800-497-8345.
[01:20:49.968 --> 01:20:50.048]  1-800-497-8345.
[01:20:50.068 --> 01:20:50.128]  1-800-497-8345.
[01:21:01.335 --> 01:21:03.496]  Hey everybody, Jason Lewis here once again.
[01:21:03.576 --> 01:21:06.278]  These are hard times for investors.
[01:21:06.338 --> 01:21:11.801]  If you're like me, you just don't know where to put your money, because there's a downside to every possible scenario.
[01:21:12.141 --> 01:21:15.343]  Now look, every portfolio needs a hedge for inflation.
[01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:16.923]  Gold has been the classic.
[01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:19.985]  I want to tell you, I want to be honest with you, commodities fluctuate.
[01:21:20.085 --> 01:21:21.146]  So you could lose money.
[01:21:21.246 --> 01:21:22.346]  Gold goes up and down.
[01:21:22.707 --> 01:21:29.010]  But every stable portfolio usually has an inflation hedge, and gold is, well, the gold standard.
[01:21:29.210 --> 01:21:32.812]  Washington is not going to get us out of this recovery, so you've got to protect yourself.
[01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:00.451]  Then tell him Jason Lewis sent ya!
[01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:19.809]  But we can't do that without your help.
[01:22:20.129 --> 01:22:30.996]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[01:22:31.396 --> 01:22:34.578]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[01:22:34.878 --> 01:22:40.522]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[01:22:41.023 --> 01:22:50.510]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[01:22:50.931 --> 01:22:52.091]  The war is here.
[01:22:52.412 --> 01:22:53.833]  It's an info war.
[01:22:54.333 --> 01:22:56.255]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[01:23:01.664 --> 01:23:04.626]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[01:23:05.046 --> 01:23:07.888]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[01:23:08.188 --> 01:23:23.118]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[01:23:23.498 --> 01:23:24.478]  In all at least 68 diseases,
[01:23:25.419 --> 01:23:29.523]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production?
[01:23:30.004 --> 01:23:32.807]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:36.590]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein.
[01:23:37.091 --> 01:23:40.755]  All other whey protein powders are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[01:23:41.235 --> 01:23:41.696]  We're good.
[01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:28.052]  All right, Joel Skelton is our guest for five minutes into the next hour that Webster Tarpley joins us to give us his geopolitical perspective.
[01:24:28.573 --> 01:24:34.354]  Joel, so, wow, this is really news I don't like to hear because I respect your geopolitical analysis and view.
[01:24:35.775 --> 01:24:40.936]  Just to get it straight, you're concurring that they pretty much have green-lighted an attack on Iran.
[01:24:41.516 --> 01:24:42.057]  How long ago
[01:24:43.544 --> 01:24:45.328]  You know, B, were you aware of this?
[01:24:45.909 --> 01:24:49.578]  And then you were getting into what this means militarily to be announcing it.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.404]  And what the whole point of that is.
[01:24:52.605 --> 01:24:53.266]  Please continue.
[01:24:53.951 --> 01:25:02.859]  Well, it's kind of an interesting story, and it's going to be the lead story on the World Affairs Brief coming out this Friday about this really difficult military decision.
[01:25:02.879 --> 01:25:09.606]  Now, this story has been green-lighted, or at least the attack on Iran has been green-lighted, clear back to 2004.
[01:25:10.727 --> 01:25:19.255]  We know that because there was a major break in security in an insider meeting in the City of London that I reported on in the World Affairs Brief whereby
[01:25:20.248 --> 01:25:34.854]  One of the persons who wasn't supposed to be there at the meeting was inadvertently invited, and they talked openly about the fact of how displeased the globalists were that Israel had not gone forward in their strike on Iran, and that was clear back in 2004.
[01:25:34.894 --> 01:25:37.195]  So this isn't something new.
[01:25:37.635 --> 01:25:38.515]  But what's interesting, in 2007,
[01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:44.365]  The establishment had to reverse its attack on Iran.
[01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:49.328]  They had three carrier task forces off of Iran ready to do it in the fall of 2007.
[01:25:49.388 --> 01:25:53.150]  You were covering that, I was covering that.
[01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:57.592]  And all of a sudden, they came out with a National Intelligent Estimate, the NIE.
[01:25:59.676 --> 01:26:06.061]  Which said suddenly that Iran had dropped their nuclear program, they were no longer a threat, and people said, what's going on here?
[01:26:06.762 --> 01:26:24.896]  And of course this was because, I believe, and that was my analysis, that Ron Paul, who was the only Republican running in 2008 on a very strong anti-war platform that was gaining popularity fast, the United States knew that they couldn't do a preemptive strike on Iran without engendering a great deal of anti-war
[01:26:26.759 --> 01:26:30.983]  Feeling in the United States that would accrue to the political benefit of Ron Paul.
[01:26:31.643 --> 01:26:41.071]  So suddenly, as soon as Ron Paul was defeated in the nomination process and really manipulated out of the show, suddenly the NIE reversed itself.
[01:26:41.411 --> 01:26:42.091]  So go figure.
[01:26:42.612 --> 01:26:48.016]  Obviously they were back on track, but Iran is now a threat and they've been pounding that drum ever since.
[01:26:48.116 --> 01:26:49.858]  But we've never seen a crescendo
[01:26:50.778 --> 01:26:55.520]  Of propaganda and war, beating of the drums, as we've seen in the last two weeks.
[01:26:56.421 --> 01:27:03.604]  Every mainstream newspaper is touting all of the Israeli stories about the things that you mentioned in the cabinet.
[01:27:04.591 --> 01:27:09.134]  This really isn't a matter of straining negotiation with the cabinet.
[01:27:09.254 --> 01:27:10.375]  All of them are on board.
[01:27:12.136 --> 01:27:16.840]  And what's interesting, though, is that there's a bunch of propaganda coming out of the U.S.
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:28.708]  press about the trip of Leon Panetta to Israel, saying that he was going there to stop Iran from... You're saying that's a show of deliberation to act like they thought things through?
[01:27:28.968 --> 01:27:34.273]  That's absolutely true, and it's absolutely false, and so is the propaganda that Leon Panetta tried to stop this.
[01:27:34.353 --> 01:27:37.136]  He was going there to coordinate US strategy.
[01:27:37.516 --> 01:27:43.562]  You go first, we'll come in and finish things up in a big way so that we can take the heat off of Israel.
[01:27:43.742 --> 01:27:53.571]  But they'll need to stage something after, well I know, I've had families sent to Kuwait, I've talked to others, they're being told Israel will strike, and I don't want to give up too many sources.
[01:27:54.272 --> 01:27:59.695]  But they're at least telling mid-level military people that it's on and before the winter gets too deep.
[01:28:00.336 --> 01:28:04.918]  So that's why I said two and a half weeks ago, I said within two weeks, then that's the danger zone.
[01:28:05.279 --> 01:28:09.021]  And now, of course, it's all over the news that they're going ahead with this attack.
[01:28:09.381 --> 01:28:12.123]  Joel, is there any way from your view to stop it?
[01:28:14.668 --> 01:28:15.989]  No, I really don't believe so.
[01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:25.416]  The only thing that has stopped it up at this point is the failure to get, to induce Iran to do or to succumb to a Gulf of Tonkin episode.
[01:28:25.436 --> 01:28:28.379]  They tried to do it a couple of years ago when the U.S.
[01:28:28.439 --> 01:28:34.443]  Navy went into the Gulf of Hormuz and they had the Iranian speedboats harassing them and they came on U.S.
[01:28:34.503 --> 01:28:43.971]  black operations on the radio on their frequency speaking, you know, with Iranian people speaking as if the speedboats were going to attack the U.S.
[01:28:44.731 --> 01:28:46.233]  We're good to go.
[01:29:05.578 --> 01:29:05.978]  The U.S.
[01:29:06.018 --> 01:29:08.119]  will beat the drums for U.N.
[01:29:08.279 --> 01:29:09.219]  increased sanctions.
[01:29:09.279 --> 01:29:22.243]  They may try to get the cut off of gasoline, which ends up being a similar act of war to what produced the Pearl Harbor attack on Japan when Britain cut off their sources of fuel and gasoline to Japan.
[01:29:22.263 --> 01:29:23.243]  It's a very similar...
[01:29:24.644 --> 01:29:25.404]  Joel, stay there.
[01:29:25.484 --> 01:29:26.565]  Long segment coming up.
[01:29:26.645 --> 01:29:28.646]  I concur with your analysis, unfortunately.
[01:29:28.706 --> 01:29:30.828]  I wish this wasn't what we're moving into.
[01:29:30.848 --> 01:29:37.292]  And so I want to look at, if the strike comes, which is probably 95% chance now, barring a miracle.
[01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:41.455]  We saw that with Fox Fallon refused as well, as you said in 2007, 2008.
[01:29:42.536 --> 01:29:44.537]  Barring a miracle, then what's going to happen?
[01:29:44.817 --> 01:29:46.578]  What do you think the aftermath will be of that?
[01:29:46.598 --> 01:29:48.179]  How does China tie in?
[01:29:48.219 --> 01:29:49.340]  How does Russia tie in?
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:50.101]  Stay with us.
[01:29:54.343 --> 01:29:57.106]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:35.356]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[01:32:00.523 --> 01:32:04.746]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:05.067 --> 01:32:05.667]  Number 1.
[01:32:05.987 --> 01:32:09.130]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.970]  Number 2.
[01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:14.814]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:15.154 --> 01:32:15.615]  It's true.
[01:32:15.895 --> 01:32:20.458]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:20.779 --> 01:32:21.319]  Number 3.
[01:32:21.599 --> 01:32:24.882]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:25.182 --> 01:32:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:29.626]  Number 4.
[01:32:29.886 --> 01:32:32.248]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:32.649 --> 01:32:36.032]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:32:36.333 --> 01:32:36.533]  Number 5.
[01:32:37.113 --> 01:32:41.038]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:32:41.258 --> 01:32:46.023]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:32:46.303 --> 01:32:50.325]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:33:19.309 --> 01:33:21.391]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:33:21.411 --> 01:33:22.112]  to 2 p.m.
[01:33:22.192 --> 01:33:24.775]  we are here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:24.815 --> 01:33:26.276]  and of course weeknights.
[01:33:26.376 --> 01:33:27.057]  That's not enough.
[01:33:27.718 --> 01:33:30.400]  We're back weeknights 7 o'clock in Full Wars Nightly News.
[01:33:30.881 --> 01:33:32.702]  Why it's two hours long sometime.
[01:33:33.283 --> 01:33:39.689]  You know soon I'm gonna add a few commercials in and get it up to different network specs and button it down.
[01:33:40.290 --> 01:33:45.992]  But I'm actually enjoying this whole beta testing phase to figure out what I want to do with the show.
[01:33:46.433 --> 01:33:49.674]  I may even use the other set we've got built that hasn't been seen.
[01:33:51.015 --> 01:33:53.496]  I'm putting in another voiceover studio right now.
[01:33:53.896 --> 01:33:55.436]  I mean, I want to get more reporters.
[01:33:55.537 --> 01:33:56.677]  I want to get more hosts.
[01:33:57.177 --> 01:33:59.578]  I mean, I've got TV systems I can get on right now.
[01:34:00.239 --> 01:34:02.840]  The big dirty secret, though, is you get on
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:05.061]  A British satellite system?
[01:34:05.101 --> 01:34:08.183]  I've got one offering an hour show right now, years ago.
[01:34:08.603 --> 01:34:09.164]  Offering again.
[01:34:09.944 --> 01:34:10.985]  You get on U.S.
[01:34:11.025 --> 01:34:17.289]  systems or Channel 2000-something on one of the DISH systems, you might have 50,000, 100,000 viewers.
[01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:18.030]  Maybe.
[01:34:18.650 --> 01:34:21.292]  If the show's been on for six, seven months and people get used to it.
[01:34:22.793 --> 01:34:31.999]  Again, we have millions and millions a day and it's growing through the Internet and good old-fashioned AM and FM, but also XM, Channel 166.
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:53.989]  Which is a lot of people so what's happening is basically I'm developing the TV show I will package it for TV and so it's formatted that way and then we'll get it on this cable system that system and I think it'll probably end up reaching four or five million more people a week totally get on a bunch of different systems that's just a new audience they need to be reached
[01:34:55.427 --> 01:34:58.530]  But overall, it's about the investigative journalist teams.
[01:34:58.691 --> 01:35:03.816]  It's about the constant news and constant reports and condensing it down to 30 minutes or an hour a night.
[01:35:03.856 --> 01:35:04.937]  I haven't really decided yet.
[01:35:05.358 --> 01:35:09.462]  I'm leaning towards 30 minutes just so it's quick and easy, but has all the information people need.
[01:35:10.804 --> 01:35:16.129]  More of a discipline type format, which is hard for me to do, obviously, because I just, I love knowledge and love information.
[01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:18.611]  But we're doing all of this because of you.
[01:35:18.911 --> 01:35:24.073]  So if you haven't donated yet at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com, please do today.
[01:35:24.634 --> 01:35:27.595]  Again, NPR gets government money and then begs for money.
[01:35:28.015 --> 01:35:29.135]  And nobody says that's wrong.
[01:35:29.416 --> 01:35:36.879]  But when people that are patriots do it, there's this system-wide stigma because they're scared of good people giving.
[01:35:37.339 --> 01:35:39.162]  And pooling our resources together.
[01:35:39.502 --> 01:35:41.565]  Look at all the other people I bring on as a platform.
[01:35:41.846 --> 01:35:50.979]  All the other activist groups and organizations and the systems we've helped launch from We Are Change to Ron Paul saying half his first-run support came from this show.
[01:35:51.239 --> 01:35:52.981]  He said that here on air four years ago.
[01:35:54.057 --> 01:35:55.418]  This is an important platform.
[01:35:55.438 --> 01:35:56.138]  It's not perfect.
[01:35:56.479 --> 01:36:00.461]  In fact, I don't have a high view of myself at the end of the day.
[01:36:00.481 --> 01:36:04.464]  I mean, I know we're all fallen creatures, but the message is what is important.
[01:36:05.224 --> 01:36:07.446]  Be part of this fourth annual Money Bomb.
[01:36:07.506 --> 01:36:11.428]  Help us get the new crew we need, the expanded crew, three or four more people.
[01:36:12.109 --> 01:36:18.633]  Help us, five people if we can afford it, and help us get the extra equipment we need to actually syndicate the show now.
[01:36:19.093 --> 01:36:22.916]  By the way, the free streams are at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:36:23.477 --> 01:36:31.244]  Right now, you can go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv or InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and there's the mainstream from our system that's high quality.
[01:36:31.544 --> 01:36:37.429]  We've got the backup systems on JustinTV, Ustream, and other systems that are moderate quality.
[01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:40.172]  It's all there right now.
[01:36:40.292 --> 01:36:42.694]  Get that link out to everyone you know.
[01:36:43.034 --> 01:36:44.736]  Since we started the show an hour and a half ago,
[01:36:45.296 --> 01:36:46.136]  We've raised an additional $20,000.
[01:36:46.276 --> 01:36:49.578]  It's up to $74,000 right now.
[01:36:49.598 --> 01:36:51.499]  We need to go all the way to the top.
[01:36:52.079 --> 01:36:58.922]  $500,000 to hire the four or five people to buy that equipment and to not have to eat into our emergency reserve.
[01:36:59.822 --> 01:37:01.923]  Frankly, to expand everything like I've done,
[01:37:03.679 --> 01:37:08.424]  I've had to eat into our reserves where this company barely has any reserves now, which I don't like to do.
[01:37:08.985 --> 01:37:11.588]  But everything's coming down right now and it's just going to get crazier.
[01:37:11.628 --> 01:37:13.210]  So the banks can't be trusted.
[01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:16.994]  So instead of having four or five months of backup, we've got like two months of backup.
[01:37:19.476 --> 01:37:22.779]  I wasn't going to do a money bomb until I was being attacked a few months ago.
[01:37:22.799 --> 01:37:26.921]  And I realized, you know, the system is attacking me for doing this because they're scared of it.
[01:37:27.362 --> 01:37:28.342]  We should do this.
[01:37:28.803 --> 01:37:31.004]  But I'm going to shut up now and try to give Joel Scalzen the floor.
[01:37:31.345 --> 01:37:35.748]  Joining us from his home via video Skype, Joel Scalzen again, fighter pilot.
[01:37:36.708 --> 01:37:58.283]  Decorated what I think a Marine Corps fighter pilot I haven't scanned over his whole bio today and worked in so many areas is of course uncle Cleon Skousen wrote really some of the original handbooks that did accurately map what the globalists were up to this whole crony anti free market system but Joel you were getting to the critical juncture here
[01:37:59.003 --> 01:38:01.184]  That you believe they are?
[01:38:01.204 --> 01:38:03.305]  I mean, obviously they're flaunting it publicly.
[01:38:03.926 --> 01:38:07.768]  So this isn't just some political saber-rattling to make Iran back off?
[01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:08.648]  I mean, is that what you're saying?
[01:38:08.668 --> 01:38:11.330]  They're about to fuel the reactors in the next two weeks?
[01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:17.253]  When would you expect, and from your sources, what are you hearing is going to happen in the strike?
[01:38:17.693 --> 01:38:18.894]  My family, others.
[01:38:20.115 --> 01:38:29.161]  And of course public sources as well have said the US is planning that once Iran is hit to quote back it up as you said finish it off out of Kuwait.
[01:38:30.862 --> 01:38:36.246]  Give us your details on that and then from bad to worse the ramifications of this.
[01:38:36.366 --> 01:38:40.429]  What what you think is going to unwind and why the global elite are doing this?
[01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:43.451]  Is it more about a diversion for the new Bank of the World?
[01:38:43.772 --> 01:38:46.354]  Vatican calling for Bank of the World?
[01:38:47.154 --> 01:38:49.217]  Uh, and, uh, calling for a global currency.
[01:38:49.418 --> 01:38:55.326]  I mean, as you said, the quickening is happening, but you said you believe it really gets crazy in the next 10 years out.
[01:38:55.647 --> 01:38:58.992]  So if this is just a birth pain, my God, what's coming next?
[01:38:59.272 --> 01:39:00.974]  So kind of cover that spectrum.
[01:39:00.994 --> 01:39:01.655]  You've got the floor.
[01:39:02.247 --> 01:39:02.867]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:02.907 --> 01:39:04.948]  Let me give some background here.
[01:39:05.028 --> 01:39:10.211]  There are two major agendas in this global vice that is squeezing the world.
[01:39:10.311 --> 01:39:11.412]  One is going to be military.
[01:39:11.472 --> 01:39:19.596]  Military is able to conjure up the worst propaganda in terms of false patriotism and get even conservatives to go along with what the government wants.
[01:39:20.077 --> 01:39:22.258]  And squeezing people financially does another thing.
[01:39:22.298 --> 01:39:25.700]  Those are the two primary thrusts of the New World Order.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.882]  Military squeezing of people to give them power to resolve military conflicts.
[01:39:30.542 --> 01:39:36.847]  And then squeezing them financially with a massive catastrophe that they themselves created and giving them the power then to so-called resolve it.
[01:39:37.787 --> 01:39:41.029]  I'll cover the economy later, but let's go to the war pincer movement.
[01:39:43.697 --> 01:40:02.268]  It's been well documented on your show and your researchers as well as mine that strategically, this war in Iran is the reason why the United States government, black operations and everything, had focused on Iraq, attacking Iraq and attacking Afghanistan even before the false flag 9-11 operation.
[01:40:02.308 --> 01:40:04.269]  Those were the two nations they wanted to go into.
[01:40:04.809 --> 01:40:05.110]  Why?
[01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:08.592]  One of the reasons is not only to capture Iraqi oil.
[01:40:09.532 --> 01:40:14.618]  And to continue to aggravate the Muslim world by entering Pakistan and Afghanistan.
[01:40:15.379 --> 01:40:18.002]  But ultimately there's going to be a pincer movement on Iran.
[01:40:18.042 --> 01:40:19.724]  Iran is a huge pot of oil.
[01:40:19.824 --> 01:40:24.109]  Iran is a huge power structure, both military and intellectual.
[01:40:25.109 --> 01:40:25.349]  I think?
[01:40:44.627 --> 01:40:54.837]  At the beginning of the next year, and I think that is why they pushed up this schedule on Iran, because they've always intended to build these huge five major bases.
[01:40:55.217 --> 01:41:02.864]  There's 14 total bases in Iraq, but the five major bases were built and oversized specifically for what's coming up on attack on Iran.
[01:41:03.345 --> 01:41:05.367]  And that's why I think they've had to raise the schedule.
[01:41:05.427 --> 01:41:09.611]  And as I said, that's the reason why they sacrificed military secrecy
[01:41:10.311 --> 01:41:18.917]  In order to justify this in the public eye, there's a tremendous anti-war sentiment in the United States because of the budgetary problems.
[01:41:18.937 --> 01:41:21.439]  Ron Paul's message is resonating with people.
[01:41:21.819 --> 01:41:23.880]  We cannot afford another trillion dollar war.
[01:41:24.481 --> 01:41:28.584]  So they've got to have a major excuse to pull this off.
[01:41:28.664 --> 01:41:37.590]  And as I said, I think they're going to work through the UN, they're going to work through increased sanctions, gasoline cut off of Iran to try to get Iran to react militarily.
[01:41:38.567 --> 01:41:39.828]  I don't think this is going to happen.
[01:41:39.928 --> 01:41:48.713]  I think Iran has decided they're going to wait for a preemptive strike so that they've got the appearance of non-aggression on their side when they retaliate.
[01:41:49.473 --> 01:41:50.854]  Here's how I think this is going to play out.
[01:41:50.894 --> 01:42:01.920]  Let me just first of all cover Russia and China's view on this because a lot of people are focusing on the fact that Russia and China are both still sending over a great deal of military technology to Iran.
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:07.924]  And they've decried this report that they've already seen that comes out next week claiming Iran's secretly developing nukes.
[01:42:08.444 --> 01:42:09.024]  That's correct.
[01:42:09.604 --> 01:42:25.411]  So, but as happened in Iraq, and it's very important, even though Russia was military supporting Iraq, during the first Gulf War they were sending in transport airplanes with military reinforcements during the entire, and they weren't touched by American pilots.
[01:42:26.771 --> 01:42:31.532]  They're still going to play that game as if we're going to support you, Iran, but I don't think they will.
[01:42:31.572 --> 01:42:35.854]  I think they're going to pull out and let Iran fall to this attack.
[01:42:35.874 --> 01:42:52.478]  So I don't think we're going to be able to... They're going to support them in the UN, they're going to veto any sanctions, but they're not going to support Iran when it comes to... Well, I tend to agree, because there's actually been, for those that don't know, historically, a lot of enmity between the Russians and the Iranians.
[01:42:53.729 --> 01:42:57.891]  Well, that's because the Iranians don't want to be controlled by either the Chinese or the Russians.
[01:42:58.011 --> 01:43:00.092]  And the Russians don't like that, and the Chinese don't like that.
[01:43:00.172 --> 01:43:05.854]  But nevertheless, there's a longer-term agenda here that's very important, and I made this point on previous shows.
[01:43:06.795 --> 01:43:14.278]  This is not going to lead to the World War III scenario that I'm predicting, the nuclear war that Russia and China are preparing for long-term.
[01:43:14.298 --> 01:43:15.838]  They're at least 10 years out on that.
[01:43:16.459 --> 01:43:20.200]  But they must prepare the world for the image that the U.S.
[01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.401]  is the bully of the world.
[01:43:21.901 --> 01:43:30.223]  Every time they allow the United States to come in and wipe out a nation like Iraq, take over and oppress it, and Afghanistan, they gain points in the world.
[01:43:30.263 --> 01:43:32.464]  They create hatred against the United States.
[01:43:32.584 --> 01:43:36.125]  We ourselves are creating that hatred by our intervention.
[01:43:36.865 --> 01:43:42.226]  This is building the excuse for this great war that they're planning.
[01:43:42.586 --> 01:43:47.107]  And I think that explains why North Korea is being pampered while Iran is being attacked.
[01:43:47.507 --> 01:43:49.968]  North Korea is being carefully kept
[01:43:50.763 --> 01:43:53.967]  In position as a nuclear power, as a trigger for World War III.
[01:43:54.027 --> 01:43:55.709]  As I say, I think that's a long-term op.
[01:43:56.490 --> 01:44:02.057]  But the important point is to realize that Russia and China have a real purpose in allowing the U.S.
[01:44:02.097 --> 01:44:03.579]  to come in and devastate Iran.
[01:44:03.619 --> 01:44:05.041]  And here's how I think it's going to play out.
[01:44:05.968 --> 01:44:16.775]  I think Israel is going to do a preemptive nuclear strike, not nuclear strike, but a preemptive conventional strike on nuclear facilities, just enough to trigger Iranian retaliation.
[01:44:17.315 --> 01:44:24.940]  Now, they sent out a warning to Iran and the rest of the world by testing a long-range Jericho missile, which is capable of carrying nuclear weapons.
[01:44:25.320 --> 01:44:33.185]  I think they're telegraphing a message to Iran, don't even think about throwing any big weapons at us, or we'll retaliate with missiles.
[01:44:33.985 --> 01:44:46.407]  But we have to remember that it is my analysis that this exchange between Iran and Israel will lead, first of all, to an American intervention, and that intervention will be massive.
[01:44:47.432 --> 01:44:53.235]  I think the caretaker facilities in the Iraqi bases will immediately be downloaded from U.S.
[01:44:54.175 --> 01:45:03.099]  troops in the United States and will start to launch a massive interdiction in Iran if they retaliate at all or in the least either to Israel or to U.S.
[01:45:03.159 --> 01:45:04.480]  bases in Iraq.
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:06.541]  But the U.S.
[01:45:06.581 --> 01:45:10.243]  retaliation will be more than just the nuclear facilities.
[01:45:10.303 --> 01:45:14.725]  Just as they went into Libya on false pretenses of humanitarian action.
[01:45:15.225 --> 01:45:18.266]  They went in to physically interdict militarily.
[01:45:18.527 --> 01:45:21.368]  They're going to do this in a way that we haven't seen before.
[01:45:21.548 --> 01:45:28.130]  And they'll trigger all of their disruption rebel groups, and then call that the opposition.
[01:45:28.170 --> 01:45:29.590]  That's their new model.
[01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:39.613]  It's really almost like the Soviet model, where they would, in Eastern Europe, would foment terrorist groups, then call them the legitimate government, then the Russians would roll in.
[01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:46.435]  I mean, this is really almost a Red Army-type tactic like we saw in the, you know, 40s, 50s, 60s.
[01:45:47.155 --> 01:45:48.736]  But now expanding on that,
[01:45:50.885 --> 01:45:52.266]  What was it just four years ago?
[01:45:52.326 --> 01:45:57.729]  They purposefully leaked in even Time Magazine the two different U.S.
[01:45:57.769 --> 01:46:00.071]  plans of what they're going to hit in Iraq.
[01:46:00.371 --> 01:46:01.952]  And one of them was hundreds of sites.
[01:46:01.992 --> 01:46:03.112]  The other was thousands.
[01:46:03.473 --> 01:46:07.115]  Their entire infrastructure, their bridges, their airports, their power.
[01:46:07.875 --> 01:46:13.058]  Anything, quote, that can aid the military, their entire infrastructure, bombing it to the Stone Age.
[01:46:13.558 --> 01:46:17.099]  I mean, what a humanitarian crime that will be.
[01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:21.581]  Why, Joel, would they put out the different attack plans?
[01:46:22.282 --> 01:46:24.623]  And what's the point of putting the attack plan out today?
[01:46:28.852 --> 01:46:31.153]  They're not really putting out the detailed attack plan.
[01:46:31.213 --> 01:46:37.175]  I personally think, for example, that Israel has a problem in that it wants to avoid going over Syria.
[01:46:37.215 --> 01:46:41.377]  Syria has serious Russian anti-aircraft missile batteries.
[01:46:41.877 --> 01:46:47.079]  And so that's why Israel has gotten permission from Saudi Arabia to overfly their nation.
[01:46:47.099 --> 01:46:55.943]  They're going to take the southern route over to Iran, overflying Saudi Arabia, and trying to thread the needle down between Jordan and Egypt so that they
[01:46:56.743 --> 01:47:01.747]  You know, don't get into trouble or try to trigger any wars by these strikes that are going out there.
[01:47:02.187 --> 01:47:08.151]  But I think what's going to happen, they're going to have that preemptive strike using the bunker-busting bombs that the U.S.
[01:47:08.171 --> 01:47:10.973]  has recently transferred to Israel on the nuclear facilities.
[01:47:10.993 --> 01:47:12.834]  There'll be a retaliation against U.S.
[01:47:13.254 --> 01:47:14.215]  and Israeli targets.
[01:47:14.735 --> 01:47:17.237]  And then I think all hell's going to break loose in the Middle East.
[01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:23.842]  I think that's going to be the trigger event that Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt will all universally join forces and launch
[01:47:24.542 --> 01:47:29.187]  But Israel, the worst nightmare they could face is the barrage missile attack.
[01:47:29.528 --> 01:47:33.613]  You know, there's over 3,000 missiles aimed at Israel and these other three countries around them.
[01:47:33.933 --> 01:47:40.721]  And if they launch them in barrages, the aero-anti-ballistic missile system that Israel has will simply be overwhelmed.
[01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.983]  It might be lucky to take out a dozen.
[01:47:43.928 --> 01:47:44.168]  I think?
[01:48:02.583 --> 01:48:08.285]  As they did in Iraq, they're going to devastate infrastructure to bring Iran to its knees.
[01:48:08.365 --> 01:48:10.846]  They do not want to have to occupy Iran.
[01:48:10.866 --> 01:48:11.747]  We don't have the troops.
[01:48:11.807 --> 01:48:13.868]  There's no tolerance for occupying Iran.
[01:48:14.308 --> 01:48:24.772]  So they must bring it completely to the knees so that the Iranian government simply gives up and lets the New World Order impose its will upon Iran without occupation.
[01:48:25.352 --> 01:48:26.933]  And that's the difference between now and Iraq.
[01:48:27.645 --> 01:48:37.731]  Now, we know the Iranians, twenty-something years ago, when they had tinker toy weapons compared to what they have now, put up an incredible seven-year fight against Saddam in the full U.S.
[01:48:37.811 --> 01:48:40.092]  backing, and over a million of them died.
[01:48:40.112 --> 01:48:53.240]  I mean, looking at the different profiles of the Iranians, and there's 80 million of them instead of 25 million Iraqis, I mean, this is probably going to get super nasty.
[01:48:54.448 --> 01:48:54.908]  The U.S.
[01:48:54.989 --> 01:49:02.736]  attack plans plan to fight this war at a suitable distance, specifically because of this vastly increased Iranian arsenal.
[01:49:03.117 --> 01:49:13.787]  You are not going to see any of our ships go into the Straits of Hormuz until we have devastated first all of the naval assets of Iran, which have potent sea-skimming missiles which could be devastating.
[01:49:14.668 --> 01:49:22.991]  And Iran does have long-range missiles, or I'm sorry, medium-range missiles that can reach Israel and can reach naval forces.
[01:49:23.031 --> 01:49:23.751]  So the U.S.
[01:49:23.771 --> 01:49:26.952]  is going to do a stand-back, long-distance attack.
[01:49:27.812 --> 01:49:32.734]  Certainly, but what about the proxy forces, Hezbollah, other sleeper cells?
[01:49:32.754 --> 01:49:42.317]  I mean, that's the Iranian tactic, is going to be not just missiles, but they're going to undoubtedly turn loose asymmetrical squads in Israel and other areas.
[01:49:42.377 --> 01:49:43.938]  I mean, all hell is going to break loose.
[01:49:44.458 --> 01:49:44.998]  Absolutely.
[01:49:45.018 --> 01:49:48.379]  We're going to see a total Hezbollah attack into Israel.
[01:49:48.399 --> 01:49:50.439]  We're going to see it crossing the border.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:53.860]  Israel's going to have its hand full, especially with missiles raining down.
[01:49:53.940 --> 01:49:56.001]  I think Syria's going to unleash all of their missiles.
[01:49:56.761 --> 01:49:57.821]  And they have ground forces.
[01:49:57.861 --> 01:49:58.881]  They have tanks.
[01:49:59.321 --> 01:50:02.862]  This is going to be a massive Middle East war, in my opinion.
[01:50:03.022 --> 01:50:05.843]  It's not going to end soon, and it's not going to end easily.
[01:50:05.883 --> 01:50:10.604]  It's not going to be like a cakewalk that relatively Iraq was for U.S.
[01:50:10.644 --> 01:50:10.924]  forces.
[01:50:11.223 --> 01:50:14.465]  Yeah, I've talked to military people I know who are usually, oh, it's no problem.
[01:50:14.806 --> 01:50:16.967]  For years they've said, we don't want to attack Iran.
[01:50:17.047 --> 01:50:21.570]  And now they're really concerned because they realize this is going to be a big, nasty war.
[01:50:22.131 --> 01:50:24.232]  And the Iranians aren't going to give up.
[01:50:24.412 --> 01:50:32.278]  And I think the people that think that they're going to bomb them, and then they're going to have an uprising of, you know, the young people that want to listen to rock and roll, that's not going to happen.
[01:50:32.318 --> 01:50:36.121]  When their own country's bombed, most of those peaceniks are going to end up joining the mullahs.
[01:50:37.128 --> 01:50:37.568]  Absolutely.
[01:50:37.588 --> 01:50:41.510]  There's going to be a tremendous patriotic rebellion against the West, against Israel in Iran.
[01:50:41.530 --> 01:50:45.373]  All right, well let's come back, Joel, in the next two short segments with you.
[01:50:45.413 --> 01:50:46.553]  Wow, I could talk to you all day.
[01:50:46.593 --> 01:50:47.814]  We really appreciate you joining us.
[01:50:48.494 --> 01:50:51.156]  And get your view on why they're doing this now.
[01:50:51.796 --> 01:50:57.299]  Obviously for the political distractions for this new Bank of the World being set up that the Vatican and others are talking about.
[01:50:57.639 --> 01:50:59.840]  Joel Scalz is our guest, World Affairs Briefs' website.
[01:50:59.860 --> 01:51:01.121]  We'll tell you the website when we come back.
[01:51:01.201 --> 01:51:04.743]  If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.
[01:51:05.043 --> 01:51:06.384]  Are you gaining more body fat?
[01:51:06.624 --> 01:51:07.745]  Are you feeling tired?
[01:51:07.985 --> 01:51:09.586]  Are you losing your sex drive?
[01:51:09.946 --> 01:51:10.846]  It's not your fault.
[01:51:11.067 --> 01:51:13.948]  After 40, your body's testosterone may start dropping.
[01:51:14.108 --> 01:51:19.892]  And if you're an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.
[01:51:20.152 --> 01:51:21.493]  Be the man you used to be.
[01:51:21.673 --> 01:51:25.375]  Call for a risk-free trial of Ageless Male, a natural supplement.
[01:51:25.555 --> 01:51:31.017]  Shown to raise testosterone by 61% and maintain healthy, normal levels.

[01:51:37.398 --> 01:51:38.999]  No injections or appointments.

[01:51:49.665 --> 01:51:49.885]  That's 1-800-497-8345.
[01:52:02.344 --> 01:52:06.647]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:07.027 --> 01:52:12.911]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:13.471 --> 01:52:15.212]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:15.733 --> 01:52:17.494]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:18.134 --> 01:52:21.857]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:25.252]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:26.073 --> 01:52:29.336]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:52:29.916 --> 01:52:38.424]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:38.965 --> 01:52:41.827]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:45.831]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:46.852 --> 01:52:51.094]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:52:51.794 --> 01:53:05.641]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:12.204]  That's the sound of the same door now protected by the Door Sentinel at MySafeDoor.com.

[01:53:26.354 --> 01:53:27.675]  MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:27.755 --> 01:53:29.397]  That's MySafeDoor.com.
[01:53:29.977 --> 01:53:32.119]  We want to know, how do you use Webex?
[01:53:33.311 --> 01:53:35.933]  I use Webex anytime I need to meet with clients.
[01:53:36.273 --> 01:53:39.716]  With the new Webex High Quality Video, it's like meeting face-to-face.
[01:53:40.897 --> 01:53:44.239]  Connect online and share what's on your computer screen with others.
[01:53:44.599 --> 01:53:45.860]  Anytime, anywhere.

[01:53:49.423 --> 01:53:50.784]  How do you use Webex?
[01:53:51.364 --> 01:53:55.007]  Go to Webex.com right now and try Webex free.
[01:53:55.727 --> 01:53:57.088]  Webex from Cisco.
[01:53:57.849 --> 01:53:59.590]  W-E-B-E-X dot com.
[01:54:13.396 --> 01:54:18.819]  We are fueling our tanks right now to launch another attack on the New World Order and the Info War.
[01:54:18.839 --> 01:54:22.061]  And the pen is mightier than the sword.
[01:54:22.822 --> 01:54:29.326]  That's why when the Globalists weren't ready for this to be public three weeks ago, they attacked me big time when I said they were green-lighting the attack on Iran.
[01:54:29.346 --> 01:54:32.648]  Because they don't want you to have a debate about that.
[01:54:32.668 --> 01:54:34.229]  They just want to sell you the propaganda.
[01:54:35.029 --> 01:54:39.432]  But it did basically blow up in their face that fake Iranian thing with the used car salesman.
[01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:41.193]  That came out and turned out to be fake.
[01:54:42.168 --> 01:54:42.668]  They don't care.
[01:54:42.688 --> 01:54:45.610]  They're moving along with this new report that they're developing nukes.
[01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:52.794]  If you want to learn about Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places, 3rd Edition, we sold out of this for a while, but we've got it back in.
[01:54:52.834 --> 01:54:54.555]  It's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:54.955 --> 01:54:56.315]  Jill Skousen's excellent book.
[01:54:57.336 --> 01:55:03.139]  And Purchase of Books videos, not just, you know, only supports our operation, but the authors themselves.
[01:55:03.539 --> 01:55:04.400]  We've also got a deal.
[01:55:05.776 --> 01:55:09.518]  Because of all this stuff coming down where I'm selling our bumper sticker packs at cost.
[01:55:10.018 --> 01:55:11.479]  This is at cost.
[01:55:13.179 --> 01:55:17.521]  It was $25 to get the 25 pack of bumper stickers.
[01:55:17.601 --> 01:55:17.961]  Now it's $5.95.
[01:55:18.042 --> 01:55:19.802]  That's at cost.
[01:55:24.509 --> 01:55:26.950]  We've got the patriotic Don't Tread on Me flags.
[01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:29.811]  We've got the Alex Jones Essential Special.
[01:55:30.571 --> 01:55:32.612]  Five of my best films for $24.95.
[01:55:32.672 --> 01:55:35.573]  We have the Alex Everything Special.
[01:55:36.873 --> 01:55:37.674]  How many films is that?
[01:55:37.714 --> 01:55:39.214]  It's like 12, 13, 14 films.
[01:55:39.674 --> 01:55:41.055]  You can go look it up.
[01:55:41.075 --> 01:55:41.855]  Normally $349.
[01:55:41.935 --> 01:55:43.696]  It's $99.95 right now.
[01:55:44.136 --> 01:55:45.896]  The Alex Jones Everything Special.
[01:55:46.036 --> 01:55:46.797]  All of my films.
[01:55:47.397 --> 01:55:49.718]  So that's available as well.
[01:55:49.738 --> 01:55:51.718]  And don't forget InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:55:51.738 --> 01:55:52.799]  We only do this once a year.
[01:55:53.499 --> 01:55:59.525]  We fight back against NPR and the rest of them by saying, hey, why not donate to help build our larger media operation?
[01:55:59.545 --> 01:56:04.169]  We're not just doing a radio show here, but the films, the news websites, all of it.
[01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:10.416]  Going back to Joel Skousen, Joel, I was getting into the point of why are they doing this?
[01:56:10.436 --> 01:56:12.578]  We've talked about it looks like they're going to do it.
[01:56:12.958 --> 01:56:14.399]  This is what will happen militarily.
[01:56:15.441 --> 01:56:19.166]  But why is the establishment doing it right now?
[01:56:19.347 --> 01:56:29.702]  I mean, clearly it's because they're openly bringing the world into global receivership, announcing the Bank of the World, the global currency, or at least the beginnings of it, or are there other factors?
[01:56:30.658 --> 01:56:35.984]  Personally, Alex, I do not believe that the global currency is anywhere near in the offing.
[01:56:36.164 --> 01:56:38.486]  They keep talking about it's going to take years of talk.
[01:56:38.687 --> 01:56:45.654]  You just don't have enough money creation power in the world to replace what the dollar has spewed forth around the world.
[01:56:45.694 --> 01:56:46.835]  We've spread our inflation.
[01:56:48.337 --> 01:56:50.539]  It's a hundred times larger than any other currency.
[01:56:50.559 --> 01:56:52.001]  Sure, why launch the war now then?
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:57:01.829]  I believe the war is being launched now specifically because their major kingpin in this pincer attack on Iran is losing the bases in Iraq.
[01:57:02.089 --> 01:57:06.234]  They want to move this before they actually have to go through with the Iraq withdrawal.
[01:57:06.774 --> 01:57:10.978]  I've been predicting this for years, that the U.S.
[01:57:11.079 --> 01:57:14.462]  would do anything to keep from having to abandon those bases there.
[01:57:14.863 --> 01:57:16.325]  And I think this is why it's happening.
[01:57:16.766 --> 01:57:17.928]  It's a short-term approach.
[01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:24.540]  They've been trying to get this Iran attack off the road a long time and that's why they're beefing up the propaganda.
[01:57:25.603 --> 01:57:31.485]  But that attack, I think, is going to go forward regardless, even if they have to do it completely, preemptively.
[01:57:31.505 --> 01:57:38.808]  And that's why Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel, keeps beating the drums about Iran as our biggest threat, and that threat is growing.
[01:57:39.008 --> 01:57:45.371]  And by the way, that'll help him politically, and also the neocons have told Obama, do this and we'll stop attacking you.
[01:57:46.909 --> 01:57:56.412]  That's right, and of course it's not going to happen, but remember the large, the big picture here is that war is the only thing that's really going to give us a new world currency.
[01:57:56.432 --> 01:58:01.274]  There is no mechanism to voluntarily place with a basket currency or anything else.
[01:58:01.354 --> 01:58:02.835]  I've explained that in my world affairs brief.
[01:58:02.855 --> 01:58:06.256]  You can't have an EU type of agreement between the basket of currencies.
[01:58:06.736 --> 01:58:07.837]  We're good to go.
[01:58:24.625 --> 01:58:25.785]  Eight to ten years, I believe.
[01:58:25.945 --> 01:58:26.806]  All right, Joel, stay there.
[01:58:26.826 --> 01:58:28.446]  We're gonna come back with five more minutes with you.
[01:58:28.486 --> 01:58:29.307]  Wish we had more time.
[01:58:29.627 --> 01:58:32.008]  And Webster Tarpley's coming up, and we'll take some calls then.
[01:58:32.308 --> 01:58:35.469]  Worldaffairsbrief.com is Joel's website.
[01:58:35.789 --> 01:58:38.230]  We're gonna be broadcasting for 27 hours straight.
[01:58:38.590 --> 01:58:39.050]  Stay with us.
[01:58:41.591 --> 01:58:43.371]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:51.158 --> 01:58:52.319]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:52.339 --> 01:58:59.002]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:59.262 --> 01:59:01.543]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.824 --> 01:59:07.026]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:07.186 --> 01:59:09.968]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:10.248 --> 01:59:12.309]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.549 --> 01:59:18.473]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.793 --> 01:59:21.995]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:22.175 --> 01:59:27.718]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.958 --> 01:59:29.279]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.599 --> 01:59:30.760]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:33.442]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.582 --> 01:59:37.624]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:37.804 --> 01:59:39.846]  You can find the video at www.

[01:59:42.408 --> 01:59:43.409]  That's End of America.

[02:00:05.799 --> 02:00:10.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:11.440]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.201 --> 02:00:13.121]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.761 --> 02:00:17.342]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.942 --> 02:00:22.023]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.350 --> 02:00:33.513]  I agree with Joel Skousen that we're not going to see the new cashless world currency next month or next year.
[02:00:33.994 --> 02:00:35.975]  The point is they're moving into these SDRs.
[02:00:36.015 --> 02:00:37.796]  They're getting the governments under one authority.
[02:00:38.156 --> 02:00:43.699]  The European Union is collapsing more of the sovereignty of the nations into its own system.
[02:00:44.539 --> 02:00:46.621]  And they admit it's undemocratic, but the Greeks...
[02:00:47.641 --> 02:00:49.682]  Boy, it's confusing what's going on over there.
[02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:52.923]  First they're going to have a referendum, then they aren't, then they are, then they aren't, now they are.
[02:00:52.943 --> 02:00:55.304]  They're talking about getting, firing their military.
[02:00:55.744 --> 02:00:59.545]  Joel, just briefly from your research, what's going on in Greece right now?
[02:01:00.265 --> 02:01:06.927]  Well, Prime Minister Papandreou is the son of the former communist, great Prime Minister Papandreou.
[02:01:07.588 --> 02:01:09.408]  And, but he still has to play to the left.
[02:01:09.488 --> 02:01:10.429]  But he is a globalist.
[02:01:11.209 --> 02:01:11.369]  And,
[02:01:12.614 --> 02:01:21.979]  He was in a pincer, a political pincer, because of the globalists wanting no referendum and his own coalition saying, look, we've got to take the heat off of us or we're going to lose this election.
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:30.124]  And so they wanted the referendum, in essence, to put the blame on the people, so that when they rejected the Greek, they would be the people.
[02:01:30.404 --> 02:01:40.670]  But the breaking news was, just this last hour while we were talking, Papandreou finally acceded to the globalists' demands and called off the referendum, and that looks permanent now.
[02:01:42.845 --> 02:01:43.386]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:43.406 --> 02:01:48.670]  What do you think about this new, quote, economic union where the countries are, quote, never allowed to leave?
[02:01:48.710 --> 02:01:51.132]  I mean, that's, that's financial dictatorship.
[02:01:51.152 --> 02:02:08.906]  Yeah, that's the new Soviet version of the European Union, of which, you know, the Socialist International, which is the Moscow front, has been, and is very much a part of the European Union, has been pushing for this Sovietized version, whereby, you know, we can't let people run off and just leave their obligations to leave us standing.
[02:02:08.946 --> 02:02:10.067]  And this will happen, of course,
[02:02:10.507 --> 02:02:11.308]  We're good to go.
[02:02:29.025 --> 02:02:30.867]  No, they're only using this to get more power.
[02:02:30.887 --> 02:02:33.690]  They always, like the Banker Bailout here, it's all stage.
[02:02:33.730 --> 02:02:34.271]  They admit it is.
[02:02:34.671 --> 02:02:35.112]  Exactly.
[02:02:35.532 --> 02:02:36.914]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[02:02:36.954 --> 02:02:41.960]  The EU G20 meeting going on right now, there's a lot of arms being twisted.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:49.688]  They're looking at Greece and that's, I think there were some behind the scenes stuff going on at the G20 meeting that turned
[02:02:50.970 --> 02:02:54.412]  Papandreou around, but we're going to see Greece stay in there.
[02:02:54.932 --> 02:02:57.153]  We're going to see, and they've got to do this to save Italy.
[02:02:57.573 --> 02:03:03.916]  Italy is very nearing the basket case that Greece is in, and it's five times larger than Greece.
[02:03:03.996 --> 02:03:05.417]  This is a major problem.
[02:03:05.837 --> 02:03:07.738]  So they don't want a domino effect going on.
[02:03:08.478 --> 02:03:18.103]  And right now I think they're moving towards condensing a lot more Eurosceptics to join and giving the EU much greater power to control finances.
[02:03:19.454 --> 02:03:22.218]  Joel, we've got Webster Tarbly coming up, who's been in Libya.
[02:03:22.278 --> 02:03:24.100]  We're going to get his take on what happened in Libya.
[02:03:24.140 --> 02:03:26.703]  We're going to get his take on the economy and more.
[02:03:27.524 --> 02:03:30.888]  We're doing a 27-hour transmission here, but if you can, we've got a break.
[02:03:30.909 --> 02:03:36.936]  I want to hold you just two or three minutes on the other side and get your view on Election 2012, the different candidates.
[02:03:39.341 --> 02:03:40.342]  We've got about a minute and a half now.
[02:03:40.362 --> 02:03:41.062]  Go ahead and start.
[02:03:41.543 --> 02:03:47.027]  Well, it's been amazing to see the manipulation of the Republican nomination process.
[02:03:47.948 --> 02:03:55.174]  It's even worse than 2008 when Rudolph Giuliani, a cross-dressing, non-conservative person, was trying to foist it on the people.
[02:03:55.754 --> 02:04:00.158]  He wasn't hacking the polls, even though they were claiming he had 30% support.
[02:04:00.778 --> 02:04:05.221]  They pulled him out of the first two primaries so that they wouldn't document his low reading.
[02:04:06.082 --> 02:04:09.445]  And resurrected John McCain with six newspaper endorsements.
[02:04:10.045 --> 02:04:13.028]  Now the problem is that Romney got a head start in 2008.
[02:04:13.408 --> 02:04:17.811]  They brought out Huckabee to kill Romney's chances with the Fundamentalist Christians.
[02:04:18.632 --> 02:04:29.681]  Huckabee wasn't in for it this time, and so they brought in Herman Cain to do that, to pull off the Christian vote and to bring up the Mormon versus Evangelical arguments all over again.
[02:04:30.081 --> 02:04:34.825]  They tried to resurrect Rick Perry, who's a globalist masquerading as a conservative.
[02:04:35.405 --> 02:04:41.870]  Yeah, let's break down your view on that, and then we'll get Webster Tarpley up right after that.
[02:04:41.890 --> 02:04:43.672]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[02:04:43.732 --> 02:04:44.432]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[02:05:03.018 --> 02:05:06.621]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:06.981 --> 02:05:15.107]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:15.848 --> 02:05:19.871]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:20.471 --> 02:05:31.300]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:40.923]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:41.423 --> 02:05:46.465]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[02:05:54.328 --> 02:05:56.749]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:06:02.228 --> 02:06:05.871]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:06.251 --> 02:06:09.253]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:09.494 --> 02:06:14.277]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:14.297 --> 02:06:20.562]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.702 --> 02:06:22.924]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:23.464 --> 02:06:23.744]  Tim Geithner?
[02:06:23.764 --> 02:06:24.184]  Bernanke?
[02:06:24.285 --> 02:06:24.885]  They're arsonists!
[02:06:24.945 --> 02:06:26.206]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:26.226 --> 02:06:28.467]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:42.375 --> 02:06:44.196]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:06:44.496 --> 02:06:49.317]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:06:49.637 --> 02:06:58.820]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:02.119 --> 02:07:06.423]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[02:07:06.823 --> 02:07:12.688]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:07:13.248 --> 02:07:15.010]  Number one, study the past.
[02:07:15.510 --> 02:07:17.272]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:07:17.912 --> 02:07:21.656]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:25.029]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:07:25.849 --> 02:07:29.130]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:07:29.690 --> 02:07:34.432]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:07:34.752 --> 02:07:38.193]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:07:38.753 --> 02:07:41.614]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:07:42.155 --> 02:07:46.036]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:46.636 --> 02:07:50.899]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[02:07:51.559 --> 02:07:55.682]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:07:56.202 --> 02:07:58.564]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:08:05.984 --> 02:08:10.166]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:08:10.807 --> 02:08:11.627]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.408 --> 02:08:13.368]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.928 --> 02:08:17.570]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:22.253]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.114 --> 02:08:26.495]  Well, I always enjoy talking to Joel Skelton.
[02:08:26.876 --> 02:08:29.057]  Webster Tarpley's coming up here in about five minutes.
[02:08:33.115 --> 02:08:34.036]  So much is happening.
[02:08:34.076 --> 02:08:36.518]  I mean, this is an incredible time we're living through.
[02:08:37.138 --> 02:08:43.383]  World governments being unveiled publicly, the Vatican's calling for the Bank of the World, global currency.
[02:08:43.403 --> 02:08:48.487]  The point is, all those people that called us kooks and things, you know, who's laughing now?
[02:08:49.348 --> 02:08:56.094]  And just like I told you two and a half weeks ago, I said, the word is I've got within two weeks, and then out from that point, there could be an attack.
[02:08:56.154 --> 02:08:57.515]  Briefly, before we get back into politics,
[02:08:58.939 --> 02:09:03.041]  Because I know you spoke to this, but specifically with any of your sources, I know you have a lot of them, Joel.
[02:09:03.961 --> 02:09:11.545]  I've been told any time from three or four days ago up until the middle of December, that's the window to strike.
[02:09:12.345 --> 02:09:17.868]  Because the US troops have to leave in December, that's what I've been told by the military sources, multiple, just what you said.
[02:09:17.888 --> 02:09:26.852]  They're also looking at Kuwait as a command base to launch US attacks, aircraft, including helicopters flying around over the ocean, shooting up their patrol boats.
[02:09:28.895 --> 02:09:33.665]  And what's the time frame on an Israeli then backed up by a U.S.
[02:09:33.685 --> 02:09:34.406]  strike on Iran?
[02:09:35.404 --> 02:09:44.952]  Well, my military sources indicate that indeed they are transferring assets right now to Kuwait, and they're also, it's a steady stream of shipments going into Israel.
[02:09:44.992 --> 02:09:48.715]  That means they're beefing up their supplies of military hardware for this attack.
[02:09:49.255 --> 02:09:55.581]  I can't say, and I don't know of any of my military sources, know that it, when the date's coming, because I think it's still in flux.
[02:09:56.081 --> 02:10:00.285]  They're still trying to wait for a political justification or a public
[02:10:00.985 --> 02:10:02.385]  Propaganda justification.
[02:10:02.845 --> 02:10:05.546]  Short of that though, it's going to happen before January.
[02:10:06.586 --> 02:10:06.766]  Yeah.
[02:10:07.086 --> 02:10:08.666]  Why do you think, when the U.S.
[02:10:08.726 --> 02:10:17.168]  is forced to leave Iraq, why do you think they're doing an emergency EAS takeover drill for the first time in history to not work in radio?
[02:10:17.528 --> 02:10:21.489]  This is the first time where the government takes over the radio and TV.
[02:10:21.849 --> 02:10:23.869]  That system's been in place since 96.
[02:10:23.909 --> 02:10:25.549]  The overall system since the 50s.
[02:10:26.249 --> 02:10:27.710]  Part of, you know, obviously
[02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:39.359]  Nuclear attack civil defense system, but but now they're even talking about cell phones in the future will be taken over by the government Telescreens everywhere, but November 9th.
[02:10:39.679 --> 02:10:48.707]  They're doing a FEMA FCC martial law takeover drill and I've learned they're also going to have nationwide TSA checkpoints on the same day.
[02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:52.811]  This is clearly an internal defense martial law drill, Joel.
[02:10:53.479 --> 02:10:57.640]  Well, I would be careful not to make too much of this one coming November 9th.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:00.020]  They're not going to do that much that quick.
[02:11:00.641 --> 02:11:07.222]  I think what they're doing, the major change is they're intervening in daytime, in the afternoon, which is going to impact television.
[02:11:07.262 --> 02:11:12.263]  They're going to get up front and noticed by people, but they won't take it to any extremes.
[02:11:12.823 --> 02:11:18.204]  I think this is an incremental step up of just what you're talking about, but it's not going to happen this time.
[02:11:18.684 --> 02:11:19.905]  It's going to get in your face.
[02:11:19.945 --> 02:11:21.725]  People are getting used to the inconvenience.
[02:11:22.165 --> 02:11:25.110]  But it's further down the line when this other stuff gets really big.
[02:11:25.291 --> 02:11:25.792]  But you're right.
[02:11:26.032 --> 02:11:27.475]  This is the track that they're heading on.
[02:11:27.815 --> 02:11:29.758]  But let's not make too much out of the ninth one.
[02:11:29.799 --> 02:11:31.802]  I think we'll disappoint people like Y2K.
[02:11:33.174 --> 02:11:34.094]  No, no, I agree with you.
[02:11:34.675 --> 02:11:40.578]  They're beta testing it, just like they're now going to have PSAs on hotel TV saying, look for terrorists.
[02:11:40.898 --> 02:11:44.059]  It's just all part of this Stasi society.
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:51.002]  If Americans, Joel, could see this, get in a time machine from 50 years ago and come to this time, what would they think?
[02:11:51.022 --> 02:11:54.084]  I mean, this is classic authoritarianism being set up.
[02:11:54.344 --> 02:11:57.646]  They'd be in rebellion if they saw it now, but gradually they get to accept it.
[02:11:57.666 --> 02:12:07.753]  That's the only reason that it can explain why the TSA continues to needle people at the airport, which violates their basic principle of don't bother people unless they rebel against you.
[02:12:07.773 --> 02:12:13.037]  But they're determined to get people used to this kind of needling, used to this kind of interference.
[02:12:13.477 --> 02:12:15.519]  And that's why we're going to get more of it on television.
[02:12:15.639 --> 02:12:16.800]  But it's going to be incremental.
[02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:22.304]  And if they get too much resistance, they'll back off a little bit, just like TSA always
[02:12:23.064 --> 02:12:29.181]  Pretends to back off like they did when they said they won't gonna shake down children anymore, and then they went back to it again
[02:12:30.131 --> 02:12:31.793]  That's right, it's all military tactics.
[02:12:32.073 --> 02:12:34.355]  And people say, well, at least America's America.
[02:12:34.375 --> 02:12:35.977]  We're run by global banks, folks.
[02:12:36.518 --> 02:12:40.542]  So, again, people either say Russia's good or we're bad, or we're good, Russia's bad.
[02:12:40.602 --> 02:12:40.802]  No.
[02:12:41.162 --> 02:12:43.385]  It's all crook-run, as Joel's pointed out.
[02:12:43.425 --> 02:12:51.613]  It's just different factions of crooks, but they all use the same systems, all use the latest developments in manipulation.
[02:12:51.953 --> 02:12:52.714]  Now, in two minutes,
[02:12:53.975 --> 02:13:00.281]  Joe, you were breaking down your view of how they are playing the candidates off against each other to suppress Ron Paul.
[02:13:00.301 --> 02:13:03.304]  Finish up your point about Mitt Romney.
[02:13:03.464 --> 02:13:17.036]  Well, the point is that Mitt Romney has tried for years, anybody but Mitt Romney, but he's continued to stay there despite bringing up, you know, John Huntsman, Chris Christie, Herman Cain, he's outlasted them all.
[02:13:17.556 --> 02:13:20.399]  And what that does, it puts Ron Paul in second place.
[02:13:20.879 --> 02:13:22.179]  They don't want him in second place.
[02:13:22.199 --> 02:13:24.700]  They don't want to have a convention battle with Ron Paul.
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:33.782]  They still have enough time to bring out another candidate, may try to resurrect Huntsman again, but ultimately they are preparing big time to control him.
[02:13:34.082 --> 02:13:35.422]  Romney is not a globalist.
[02:13:36.062 --> 02:13:45.664]  He's trying, bending over backwards to be one, but because he hasn't bought into the system in terms of compromise and moral indiscretions with his wife, things they can use to twist arms.
[02:13:46.604 --> 02:13:50.127]  Well, look at Herman Cain, the former head of the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:14.429 --> 02:14:14.830]  I don't
[02:14:33.152 --> 02:14:37.219]  And now we learn it's reportedly Rahm Emanuel leaking the stuff on Cain.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.462]  It's just an amazing free-for-all.
[02:14:39.983 --> 02:14:45.272]  Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com, the editor-in-chief over there, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:14:45.615 --> 02:14:48.516]  My pleasure, Alex, and good luck on your show today.
[02:14:48.676 --> 02:14:49.377]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:49.457 --> 02:14:53.219]  Yes, if you just joined us, we're doing a 27-hour transmission.
[02:14:53.239 --> 02:14:58.081]  We're two hours and 15 minutes into this one, and there's free audio and video streams.
[02:14:58.101 --> 02:15:03.563]  There's always free audio streams, but free video streams at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:15:03.583 --> 02:15:04.264]  You can't miss them.
[02:15:04.664 --> 02:15:05.764]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:15:05.804 --> 02:15:06.885]  We've got them everywhere.
[02:15:07.525 --> 02:15:11.007]  We've been streaming the nightly news since it was live last night through to this morning.
[02:15:11.867 --> 02:15:15.669]  We'll be doing nightly news tonight or tomorrow, because we're going to be basically live at those times.
[02:15:16.689 --> 02:15:18.770]  But just so much going on here.
[02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:31.877]  If you just joined us, I would encourage everybody to go up to InfoWars.com and to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and go into the press release section area.
[02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:34.430]  And you can see the schedule.
[02:15:52.469 --> 02:16:03.521]  Um, Mr. Jim Mars, Fritz Springmeier, Aaron Dykes, Watson, Paul Watson, Richard Reeves, Alan Watt, Jim Mars, Bob Chapman.
[02:16:05.383 --> 02:16:11.429]  And yes, we're either going to premiere an incredible interview up in Anchorage, Alaska, we did.
[02:16:11.450 --> 02:16:13.392]  It's never before been seen with, um,
[02:16:15.407 --> 02:16:21.010]  The individual who's of course exposed so much of the heart system and more, and that's Dr. Nick Magich.
[02:16:21.451 --> 02:16:25.153]  Where we're going to premiere, and I think it's going to be the skull and bones side.
[02:16:25.173 --> 02:16:29.716]  You know, you saw part one, Charlotte Isabel on education, her dad was skull and bones.
[02:16:31.244 --> 02:16:39.651]  And other family as well, but the point is Skull and Bones and she was high-level government and she showed us stuff never before seen on Skull and Bones.
[02:16:40.091 --> 02:16:44.294]  And we're looking to premiere that coming up as well.
[02:16:45.155 --> 02:16:49.759]  That is set to happen tomorrow morning.
[02:16:49.779 --> 02:16:53.081]  What time is that set to happen?
[02:16:53.101 --> 02:16:53.402]  7 a.m.
[02:16:55.339 --> 02:16:57.701]  Who knows, though, I might air it in the middle of the night when Aaron's on as well.
[02:16:57.741 --> 02:16:58.601]  It's just so powerful.
[02:16:59.322 --> 02:17:01.083]  And then, of course, it'll be archived at the end.
[02:17:01.103 --> 02:17:04.746]  I've noticed we've been putting the special reports in the nightly news section.
[02:17:05.166 --> 02:17:07.228]  So that's got all the reports and special reports.
[02:17:07.248 --> 02:17:10.791]  We're going to start moving those over to the special reports section, which hasn't been updated in a month.
[02:17:10.811 --> 02:17:11.751]  That's just an oversight.
[02:17:12.132 --> 02:17:17.296]  And I'm going to be putting some things in the rant section as well over at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:17:17.856 --> 02:17:20.238]  Now, this is the fourth annual InfoWars Money Bomb.
[02:17:21.377 --> 02:17:25.119]  You give money to United Way, they give a bunch of it to gun control groups.
[02:17:25.139 --> 02:17:31.083]  If you give money to NPR, they use it to sell, you know, anti-gun, anti-family garbage to the public.
[02:17:32.063 --> 02:17:41.669]  We have sponsors, we have video sales, stuff like that, but to do capital improvements, to hire more people, and guarantee their jobs, and to buy the very expensive equipment.
[02:17:41.689 --> 02:17:44.611]  I mean, I gotta buy equipment that costs what houses cost.
[02:17:45.371 --> 02:17:48.933]  You know, bandwidth costs every month.
[02:17:48.993 --> 02:17:49.514]  I could live in a
[02:17:50.968 --> 02:17:52.189]  Sixty bedroom mansion.
[02:17:53.289 --> 02:17:54.970]  We spend a lot of money around here.
[02:17:56.010 --> 02:17:56.991]  On the bandwidth, on everything.
[02:17:57.011 --> 02:17:57.791]  We have a lot of cost.
[02:17:57.851 --> 02:17:59.312]  And we're giving the globals a run for their money.
[02:17:59.512 --> 02:18:03.294]  And you can see the fruits of it, how fast we're growing, the people we've reached.
[02:18:03.714 --> 02:18:09.477]  But as the country goes into depression, our audience goes straight up, but our funding basically planes out.
[02:18:10.237 --> 02:18:14.219]  And so, it is the Money Bombs that help push us over the edge to be able to grow.
[02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:17.100]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com, infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:25.164]  A lot of the hours, also, we're going to have open hours for phones and people who view on the world and other news and your calls on the Money Bomb.
[02:18:26.004 --> 02:18:36.609]  We've got also at infowarsmoneybomb.com, down at the bottom, a link to our eBay store with a lot of, you know, Tyranny Crusher 2, Bullhorn, a sledgehammer I use to break up on the wall to the next side of the office.
[02:18:37.645 --> 02:18:39.827]  And it was used to actually tear open the hole on the other side.
[02:18:40.147 --> 02:18:42.829]  People are like, you're bashing out a wall that's an internal wall.
[02:18:42.849 --> 02:18:43.209]  Well, yeah.
[02:18:43.689 --> 02:18:47.152]  We started tearing that out first because I didn't want to mess up the electrical equipment in the wall.
[02:18:47.192 --> 02:18:48.953]  But the point is, we got a video of that.
[02:18:49.473 --> 02:18:51.155]  We did build the studio over there is the point.
[02:18:51.575 --> 02:18:53.456]  And so there's that sledgehammer.
[02:18:53.536 --> 02:18:54.077]  It's available.
[02:18:54.517 --> 02:18:58.998]  I'm going to do some pen and inks that are one time only and some acrylic paintings.
[02:18:59.318 --> 02:19:04.779]  It'll be more impressionistic probably because I can do those and kind of turn my brain off and even do better paintings when I just relax.
[02:19:05.039 --> 02:19:07.059]  If I do technical things, it takes me time.
[02:19:07.079 --> 02:19:07.559]  I won't have time.
[02:19:07.779 --> 02:19:08.820]  But tonight I'm going to do some of those.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:09.880]  I'm going to videotape that.
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:14.721]  Then we'll put those up for auction as well tomorrow for the Money Bomb.
[02:19:14.741 --> 02:19:16.421]  The Money Bomb will go right through into the weekend.
[02:19:16.441 --> 02:19:19.061]  We need to raise that half million dollars right now.
[02:19:19.081 --> 02:19:21.442]  We're going to go to break and come back for the balance of the hour.
[02:19:22.677 --> 02:19:31.159]  With Webster Griffin Tarpley of Tarpley.net to get his view on Libya, his view on the Iran strike, his view on all of it.
[02:19:31.299 --> 02:19:39.221]  It was Tarpley back in 2007 said the Iran strike is on and we later learned Cheney did have it on until Fox Fallon and others resigned and it didn't happen.
[02:19:39.581 --> 02:19:42.242]  But we're right back to that point again as I told you two and a half weeks ago.
[02:19:42.862 --> 02:19:45.563]  And now it's admitted Israel's getting ready to strike.
[02:19:45.843 --> 02:19:46.703]  Can it be stopped?
[02:19:46.743 --> 02:19:48.323]  We'll get to our police take on that.
[02:19:48.463 --> 02:19:50.624]  What will the ramifications of this new war be?
[02:19:51.284 --> 02:19:53.985]  The accelerating police state rollout and more.
[02:19:54.045 --> 02:20:00.426]  But whatever you do, get that URL and send it out to everybody to be part of this special 27-hour transmission.
[02:20:00.726 --> 02:20:01.466]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:20:01.486 --> 02:20:05.007]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:20:05.287 --> 02:20:08.808]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:20:09.108 --> 02:20:17.952]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[02:20:38.300 --> 02:20:39.721]  So, what are you waiting for?
[02:20:39.941 --> 02:20:45.363]  Get the fax and call Midas Resources toll free at 888-292-2709.

[02:21:01.360 --> 02:21:02.621]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.662 --> 02:21:08.008]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:21:08.248 --> 02:21:12.893]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:21:13.274 --> 02:21:13.674]  It's true.
[02:21:13.754 --> 02:21:18.320]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:23.542]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:21:24.062 --> 02:21:25.983]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:21:26.363 --> 02:21:30.985]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:21:31.185 --> 02:21:32.065]  And here's the best part.
[02:21:32.285 --> 02:21:35.067]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:21:35.367 --> 02:21:38.648]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:21:38.968 --> 02:21:41.809]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:42.169 --> 02:21:44.049]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:44.370 --> 02:21:45.250]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:45.470]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:48.471]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:21:48.971 --> 02:21:50.691]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:22:01.792 --> 02:22:02.872]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.

[02:23:00.603 --> 02:23:02.905]  Big Berkey Water Filters are in high demand.
[02:23:03.125 --> 02:23:04.966]  Storable foods are also in high demand.
[02:23:05.187 --> 02:23:10.050]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com has always kept our focus on the Berkey Water Filter products.
[02:23:10.231 --> 02:23:13.653]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[02:23:30.186 --> 02:23:39.131]  Combine our Berkey water filters, which are powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water with our storable foods, and you have a winning combination.

[02:24:06.601 --> 02:24:08.501]  Okay, we're going to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:24:08.561 --> 02:24:10.222]  I guess this is a good problem to have.
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:15.142]  But the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com site is crashed right now.
[02:24:15.743 --> 02:24:19.285]  We've got it on big server CDN systems.
[02:24:19.945 --> 02:24:23.748]  InfoWars.com is up, but it's getting massive traffic right now as well.
[02:24:24.348 --> 02:24:26.690]  And so you can update.
[02:24:27.802 --> 02:24:32.544]  And you can donate right on the front page of Infowars.com, PayPal, credit card, however you want.
[02:24:33.464 --> 02:24:35.025]  So the donations are really starting to come in.
[02:24:35.045 --> 02:24:36.706]  I want to thank all of you who have donated.
[02:24:36.726 --> 02:24:39.187]  I want to thank all of you who spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:24:39.527 --> 02:24:44.989]  I want to thank all of you who've been demonized and laughed at and told you're a liar when you warn folks about global government.
[02:24:45.049 --> 02:24:46.070]  Now it's all being announced.
[02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:49.431]  Because you cared about the truth more than being trendy.
[02:24:50.051 --> 02:24:51.452]  And you cared about free humanity.
[02:24:53.786 --> 02:24:58.207]  I told you NATO in September to early October was going to launch a ground offensive backing rebels.
[02:24:58.287 --> 02:24:58.708]  It happened.
[02:24:59.328 --> 02:25:01.429]  I told you they were getting ready for Iran two and a half weeks ago.
[02:25:01.469 --> 02:25:02.129]  Now they're admitting it.
[02:25:02.569 --> 02:25:03.609]  We know what we're talking about.
[02:25:03.649 --> 02:25:04.470]  This is a treasure.
[02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:05.870]  This show, our guest.
[02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:11.932]  I take you now to Webster Griffin-Tarpley, joining us via video Skype until five minutes into the next hour when Catherine Albrecht joins us.
[02:25:12.332 --> 02:25:13.633]  Webster, great to have you here.
[02:25:13.653 --> 02:25:14.673]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:25:14.693 --> 02:25:15.353]  How are you doing?
[02:25:15.513 --> 02:25:15.693]  Good.
[02:25:15.733 --> 02:25:18.114]  Give us your analysis on the Iran situation.
[02:25:18.854 --> 02:25:20.535]  Is it moving into green light phase?
[02:25:21.616 --> 02:25:22.796]  Well, it may be.
[02:25:23.417 --> 02:25:30.459]  We know that the Anglo-Americans, the imperialists, are appalled that their attack on Syria has broken down.
[02:25:30.539 --> 02:25:31.520]  It's going nowhere.
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:40.023]  Their design for this autumn was to have Libya go down, and they've succeeded maybe partially there, but not completely by any means.
[02:25:40.783 --> 02:25:42.523]  And now there's the question of Syria.
[02:25:42.763 --> 02:25:55.686]  And we know that this is difficult not to crack for them, because you've got this Russian naval base there at the port of Tartus, and you've got Iran next door, and you've got Hezbollah next door.
[02:25:55.766 --> 02:26:04.428]  So the goal is to smash the government of President Assad of Syria, using a group of really contemptible NATO
[02:26:04.428 --> 02:26:04.828]  We're good to go.
[02:26:27.003 --> 02:26:31.524]  I mean, it'd be like Americans in the streets going, Russia, please bomb America!
[02:26:31.925 --> 02:26:32.785]  It's unbelievable.
[02:26:33.125 --> 02:26:38.387]  And basically they're saying, we want civil war, we want NATO bombing, because that's what you get.
[02:26:38.547 --> 02:26:42.768]  As Secretary Gates said in a rare moment of candor before he left,
[02:26:43.268 --> 02:26:52.272]  The beginning of a no-fly zone is a comprehensive aerial bombardment with thousands and thousands of sorties of the country involved.
[02:26:52.332 --> 02:26:54.032]  So, this is now the problem.
[02:26:54.352 --> 02:26:58.754]  The Anglo-Americans, again, we're talking Obama, Hillary, Panetta.
[02:26:58.794 --> 02:27:02.756]  Remember, this country is now being run by the Principals Committee.
[02:27:03.176 --> 02:27:06.817]  Panetta, Hillary, General Petraeus.
[02:27:06.837 --> 02:27:07.598]  Be respectful!
[02:27:07.618 --> 02:27:10.379]  That's President Obama, Nobel Laureate for Peace.
[02:27:11.491 --> 02:27:15.254]  But again, the Principals Committee is where the stuff is really happening.
[02:27:15.334 --> 02:27:17.216]  Obama, by most accounts, is out of it.
[02:27:17.576 --> 02:27:30.406]  He simply, he gets his adulation when and where he can, and otherwise he retreats to the family living quarters of the White House and focuses on whatever sports event is on, or insulting people in his entourage.
[02:27:30.807 --> 02:27:31.907]  The question therefore is,
[02:27:32.688 --> 02:27:45.818]  Panetta, Hillary, General Petraeus, whom I regard as the dominant personality of this clique, along with Donilon, the head of the National Security Council, along with a couple of others, they're running the government.
[02:27:45.838 --> 02:27:46.959]  That's the Principals Committee.
[02:27:46.999 --> 02:27:48.000]  Now, what will they do?
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:53.844]  If you attack Syria, Syria has said they will retaliate directly against Israel.
[02:27:54.184 --> 02:27:56.946]  And they have very serious means of doing this now.
[02:27:57.007 --> 02:27:58.368]  They have heavy-duty
[02:27:59.108 --> 02:28:09.173]  Conventionally armed ballistic missiles, at least thought to be conventionally armed, maybe there's more that would show up on these missiles, and Iran would immediately therefore be involved.
[02:28:09.213 --> 02:28:14.576]  So this gets to look much more like World War III than the Libyan adventure that we've just seen.
[02:28:14.716 --> 02:28:22.980]  Although the Libyan adventure was a stepping stone, the problem for the Anglo-Americans is that they wanted to take Qaddafi out back in March, April, May.
[02:28:23.441 --> 02:28:23.981]  They failed.
[02:28:24.181 --> 02:28:32.484]  And Gaddafi with his blocking position has basically saved everybody else, Algeria and Syria in particular.
[02:28:32.985 --> 02:28:34.765]  So this is now the situation.
[02:28:34.825 --> 02:28:42.388]  Now, I would say this ruling class, this imperialist ruling elite that we have, are mad as hatters.
[02:28:42.468 --> 02:28:44.749]  They're about as crazy as crazy can be.
[02:28:45.209 --> 02:28:46.110]  They're crazed
[02:28:46.890 --> 02:28:50.832]  Precisely because their derivatives castle is coming down, right?
[02:28:50.852 --> 02:28:56.033]  This huge, monstrous edifice of quadrillions of dollars worth of derivatives.
[02:28:56.434 --> 02:29:04.856]  And they're also, I think, aware that their hold on power is now a little bit less firm than it had been before.
[02:29:05.297 --> 02:29:07.717]  In particular, I think we have to look at the mass strike.
[02:29:08.118 --> 02:29:08.598]  What the
[02:29:09.198 --> 02:29:09.318]  Yeah.
[02:29:24.352 --> 02:29:26.273]  All right, stay there, but I want to go around the world.
[02:29:26.673 --> 02:29:27.833]  You've been to Libya recently.
[02:29:27.853 --> 02:29:29.594]  I want to look at that, what happened there.
[02:29:30.154 --> 02:29:33.055]  I want to look at Iran coming up and what will follow that.
[02:29:33.555 --> 02:29:40.157]  I want to look then at the economy, what's happening in Greece, what's happening in Europe with Dr. Tarpley, doctor of history, he's also an economist.
[02:29:40.617 --> 02:29:46.339]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or donate at InfoWars.com if you can't get on the Money Bomb website.

[02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:50.401]  InfoWars.com.
[02:29:50.441 --> 02:29:51.301]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.801 --> 02:29:53.322]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.329 --> 02:29:57.131]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.094 --> 02:30:02.215]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:02.235 --> 02:30:08.939]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:09.180 --> 02:30:11.481]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:11.741 --> 02:30:16.905]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:17.105 --> 02:30:19.886]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:20.146 --> 02:30:22.246]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.466 --> 02:30:28.387]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:28.707 --> 02:30:31.908]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:32.088 --> 02:30:37.609]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:37.869 --> 02:30:39.190]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:40.690]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:40.810 --> 02:30:43.351]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.491 --> 02:30:44.911]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:30:45.171 --> 02:30:47.534]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:47.714 --> 02:30:52.220]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:05.760]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:09.641]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:10.041 --> 02:32:12.242]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.262 --> 02:32:17.723]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:18.143 --> 02:32:24.365]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.805 --> 02:32:30.329]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.749 --> 02:32:34.452]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.952 --> 02:32:38.935]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:39.255 --> 02:32:44.759]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:48.142]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.742 --> 02:32:50.183]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.723 --> 02:32:51.164]  It's here.

[02:33:13.521 --> 02:33:16.283]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here live!
[02:33:17.824 --> 02:33:21.007]  Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm, and normally we'd only have
[02:33:22.403 --> 02:33:38.009]  27 minutes left in transmission until this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.. But no no my friends We are going to be here live until 2 p.m.. Tomorrow, and we're just now getting as we've been booking people around for the last minute
[02:33:38.905 --> 02:33:41.847]  We're just now up at InfoWars.com and PrisonBanda.com.
[02:33:42.687 --> 02:33:46.009]  Here soon, be able to send out a schedule of who's coming up.
[02:33:46.029 --> 02:33:48.010]  But let me just read to you who's coming up.
[02:33:48.290 --> 02:33:54.873]  Joel Scalzin was on, Webster Tarpley's on now, Dr. Katherine Albrecht getting into all the internet censorship, the control grid, the spying systems.
[02:33:54.933 --> 02:33:56.174]  It's really exploded.
[02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.115]  George Norey needs no introduction.
[02:33:58.155 --> 02:34:00.216]  He's going to be joining us on Coast2CoastAM.com.
[02:34:00.556 --> 02:34:01.877]  David Icke needs no introduction.
[02:34:01.957 --> 02:34:07.520]  Mike Adams, Alfred Adask, Tex Mars, the Corbett Report.
[02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:19.823]  We've got Springmeyer, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Reeves, a special on Skull & Bones, never-before-seen information, Gerald Cilente, Alan Watt, Jim Mars, Bob Chapman, and more.
[02:34:20.163 --> 02:34:21.523]  Dan Dix, the list goes on and on.
[02:34:21.863 --> 02:34:28.525]  Great job to the crew, and great job to all the listeners out there who are helping get all this information out to everyone.
[02:34:29.585 --> 02:34:33.809]  And of course, in the run-up to this, we had Jesse Ventura and Dave Mustaine of Megadeth on yesterday.
[02:34:33.829 --> 02:34:37.993]  Jesse Ventura said the TSA is setting up martial law and he's lived under it in the Philippines.
[02:34:38.553 --> 02:34:42.237]  He said people ought to riot in the streets if they keep Ron Paul out of a third party debate.
[02:34:42.277 --> 02:34:45.400]  He said he probably would run with Ron Paul if he asked him in a third party.
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:47.542]  Ron Paul said if he doesn't win the nomination, he may do that.
[02:34:48.082 --> 02:34:48.643]  He may run.
[02:34:49.603 --> 02:34:51.665]  The question is, will Ventura be involved?
[02:34:51.865 --> 02:34:52.066]  Wow!
[02:34:53.166 --> 02:34:54.587]  Also, he wrote a bunch of other stuff.
[02:34:54.607 --> 02:34:57.428]  That's all at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:57.768 --> 02:35:08.033]  Today, the InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com has the main free video stream of this 27-hour TV slash radio extravaganza against tyranny.
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:14.122]  But, and there's also three or four backups on there that isn't just our servers, but backups.
[02:35:14.943 --> 02:35:18.244]  The Moneybomb site has been up and down a little bit because of massive traffic.
[02:35:18.525 --> 02:35:22.727]  And I want to thank all those that are donating right now at InfoWarsMoneybomb.com.
[02:35:23.147 --> 02:35:25.148]  We will have open phones coming up later as well.
[02:35:25.408 --> 02:35:27.309]  Okay, getting back to Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[02:35:27.949 --> 02:35:33.512]  Webster, looking at all this, again, I'm asking you to make the call.
[02:35:34.013 --> 02:35:38.175]  We now learn, you were right in 2007 when you said it's been green-lighted the next month.
[02:35:38.815 --> 02:35:43.857]  But we now know the green light was taken off, Cheney was countermanded, so was certain elements in Israel.
[02:35:44.338 --> 02:35:54.883]  Now you got Netanyahu before the cabinet, you got the media, that hoax two and a half weeks ago of the Iranian used car salesman in Corpus Christi, Texas, turned out totally fake, run by...
[02:35:56.063 --> 02:35:56.604]  I don't know.
[02:36:15.353 --> 02:36:16.094]  We're good to go.
[02:36:35.720 --> 02:36:42.844]  Well, the problem with attacking Iran right now that makes it more complicated than it might have been six months ago or eight months ago is that Putin is back.
[02:36:43.444 --> 02:36:47.626]  And I think if you go back to 2007, the incident that you're referring to, right?
[02:36:47.646 --> 02:36:52.029]  Cheney had been demanding an attack on Syria starting in June.
[02:36:52.549 --> 02:36:59.196]  I made this public based really just on analysis, no inside sources, just the pattern of events.
[02:36:59.917 --> 02:37:10.368]  By July, I was putting out this newspaper article, Cheney determined to strike in U.S., and then we had the Rogue B-52 at the end of August and the beginning of September.
[02:37:10.768 --> 02:37:28.346]  Which was an attempt by Cheney and the group that he speaks for to hijack a B-52 with six nuclear cruise missiles on board, fly that to the Middle East outside of the command and control of the United States, but in the command and control of the Wall Street invisible government, and start a war.
[02:37:29.287 --> 02:37:39.395]  What stopped that, when that B-52 reached the Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, was the concern, I think, about Putin.
[02:37:39.455 --> 02:37:40.816]  How would Russia respond?
[02:37:40.876 --> 02:37:41.597]  What would they do?
[02:37:42.218 --> 02:37:50.504]  Not likely they're going to start World War III, but they would respond in some way that could be very, very painful and uncomfortable for the Anglo-Americans.
[02:37:50.544 --> 02:37:52.586]  So this is now a factor.
[02:37:52.606 --> 02:37:53.767]  But now we have a new factor.
[02:37:54.187 --> 02:37:55.628]  Let's look at the Port of Oakland.
[02:37:55.708 --> 02:37:58.129]  I believe it's the fifth largest port in the United States.
[02:37:58.189 --> 02:38:01.691]  That was shut down yesterday by people who were fighting Wall Street.
[02:38:01.731 --> 02:38:07.034]  Now, whatever the particular program is or was not, I recommend a program.
[02:38:07.054 --> 02:38:13.517]  The general idea is, we don't like the banks, we don't like Wall Street, and this is already a big step forward.
[02:38:13.557 --> 02:38:17.539]  Because indeed, finance capital is everybody's public enemy, number one.
[02:38:17.599 --> 02:38:18.940]  Wall Street is the enemy.
[02:38:19.660 --> 02:38:36.592]  So if the port of Oakland is shut down, even for a few hours, suppose other ports were shut down, what does that mean when the ruling class says, are we going to mount a large military operation in the Eastern Mediterranean in the face of a movement that has now shown that it can shut down a port?
[02:38:37.153 --> 02:38:39.014]  There are plenty of historical examples for this.
[02:38:39.174 --> 02:38:41.736]  Mass strikes can stop foreign wars.
[02:38:42.416 --> 02:38:50.245]  You could say the attempt of the Allies after World War I to invade Soviet Russia was stopped by revolutionary ferment.
[02:38:50.325 --> 02:38:57.633]  Mass strikes with working class demands in countries of Europe and also to some extent in the United States.
[02:38:57.854 --> 02:38:58.174]  But now...
[02:38:59.675 --> 02:39:03.637]  Therefore, we have to say, what will Putin do, say?
[02:39:03.737 --> 02:39:05.758]  Will there be some kind of a move by Russia?
[02:39:06.059 --> 02:39:16.744]  There's already been the joint Russian-Chinese veto of the US-British attempt to get the attack on Syria approved in some form in the UN Security Council.
[02:39:16.784 --> 02:39:18.505]  But that is obviously not enough.
[02:39:18.525 --> 02:39:21.847]  The hysteria of the Anglo-Americans is even greater.
[02:39:22.307 --> 02:39:25.930]  Now, I have to pull back a little bit and move to another part of the Mediterranean.
[02:39:25.950 --> 02:39:27.571]  Now, we've got to talk about Greece for a minute.
[02:39:28.151 --> 02:39:29.892]  And we've got to talk about Cannes, right?
[02:39:29.932 --> 02:39:31.854]  We've got to talk about the G20, right?
[02:39:31.874 --> 02:39:37.457]  The heads of every top 20 countries in the world are now meeting on the French Riviera, right?
[02:39:37.477 --> 02:39:38.178]  The Côte d'Azur.
[02:39:38.498 --> 02:39:39.779]  So what's going on here?
[02:39:39.839 --> 02:39:43.061]  I think this is really interesting, what's happened in the last couple of days there.
[02:39:43.461 --> 02:39:46.544]  And it allows us to see what might be coming inside the United States.
[02:39:47.384 --> 02:40:02.367]  Greece, of course, is in financial trouble because it's being attacked by zombie bankers and hedge fund hyenas using credit default swaps and other means, with the help of the ratings agencies, which have to be regarded as an arm of intelligence.
[02:40:02.447 --> 02:40:07.008]  In other words, they're an arm of the intelligence community, and what they do is strategically targeted.
[02:40:07.048 --> 02:40:08.529]  They're also very corrupt.
[02:40:08.549 --> 02:40:10.269]  They do insider trading and all the rest of it.
[02:40:10.569 --> 02:40:11.809]  So Greece is in trouble.
[02:40:11.929 --> 02:40:14.310]  It is a somewhat artificial crisis, although
[02:40:14.890 --> 02:40:21.415]  Probably the Greek debt is somewhat larger than it needs to be, but it doesn't need to be this kind of a life-and-death crisis.
[02:40:22.376 --> 02:40:27.960]  Papandreou is the socialist Prime Minister of Greece, and he's been running this crisis the whole time.
[02:40:28.260 --> 02:40:30.942]  He's an agent of the International Monetary Fund.
[02:40:31.222 --> 02:40:34.925]  He represents the London and New York and other banks.
[02:40:35.586 --> 02:40:40.930]  It is impossible to run class defense when you've got an IMF agent
[02:40:41.690 --> 02:40:44.553]  Sitting at the top of the so-called progressive coalition.
[02:40:44.593 --> 02:40:46.515]  That's what the Greeks actually have.
[02:40:46.555 --> 02:40:49.657]  So the Greek labor movement has been wonderful.
[02:40:50.038 --> 02:40:56.143]  They've come up with a dozen or maybe fifteen general strikes, but they haven't been able to even get Papandreou out.
[02:40:56.263 --> 02:40:58.025]  Partly because of this stuff.
[02:40:58.145 --> 02:41:03.109]  Anarchists have come in and said, no, we want to have general assemblies and facilitators and all the rest of this.
[02:41:03.130 --> 02:41:04.451]  Well, let me stop you there, Webster.
[02:41:04.471 --> 02:41:05.732]  Webster Tarpley joining us.
[02:41:05.792 --> 02:41:07.654]  I mean, let's look at this here.
[02:41:08.234 --> 02:41:12.337]  What's going on with Papandreouf saying we're going to have a referendum or not?
[02:41:12.417 --> 02:41:13.878]  We are, we aren't, now we aren't.
[02:41:13.898 --> 02:41:24.826]  And we know he's a globalist, we know he's Goldman Sachs handled, we know that Greece supposedly owes a hundred billion but they need 1.4 trillion, leveraged three times, almost to five trillion.
[02:41:25.246 --> 02:41:34.292]  We know this is all a giant stinking fraud and then you've got the Vatican saying we need to punish those bankers with a new Bank of the World and giving the bankers more power.
[02:41:36.733 --> 02:41:38.054]  Let's be granular, okay?
[02:41:38.094 --> 02:41:43.436]  Let's get into the details on that, because the idea of taxing Wall Street is the obvious thing to do.
[02:41:43.796 --> 02:41:45.156]  The question is, who gets the money?
[02:41:45.536 --> 02:41:47.177]  Now, there's a Delphic version of it, right?
[02:41:47.197 --> 02:41:54.379]  By the way, they then call that collectivism, but we're all paying tens of trillions in banker bailouts that's stolen.
[02:41:54.700 --> 02:41:58.461]  You're saying, actually claw back the money from these offshore crooks.
[02:41:58.761 --> 02:42:00.481]  And then they say, no, that's not free market.
[02:42:00.722 --> 02:42:04.523]  And Rush Limbaugh says, what is free market is giving all your money in banker bailout to them.
[02:42:05.428 --> 02:42:23.072]  The big issue going into this G20 in Cannes was that everybody in Europe, France, Germany, the European Commission, the Pope, you name it, as well as the whole trade union movement, they're demanding a tax on speculation, on speculative turnovers.
[02:42:23.592 --> 02:42:26.233]  Now naturally, since these people are bad,
[02:42:26.773 --> 02:42:29.696]  They have a version of this which is not quite the right one.
[02:42:30.336 --> 02:42:35.380]  Nevertheless, the idea of bringing this forward is letting a powerful genie out of the bottle.
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:51.975]  And you can tell that the controlled media, the so-called mainstream media in the United States, never talk about the demand for the Tobin tax, the Wall Street sales tax, the Robin Hood tax, I guess some people call it, not a good term for it, the financial transaction tax.
[02:42:52.735 --> 02:43:01.304]  The point is, you put a 1% tax on Wall Street turnover, which is in the quadrillions, and you get trillions of dollars for the public till.
[02:43:01.584 --> 02:43:04.427]  That means you don't need genocidal budget cuts.
[02:43:04.447 --> 02:43:09.211]  You don't need to kill your own people in the name of a balanced budget that you're not going to get to anyway.
[02:43:09.432 --> 02:43:12.354]  But now, the news of the past six hours or so,
[02:43:12.975 --> 02:43:18.637]  Papandreou had said, since my government is about to collapse, I'm going to call for a referendum.
[02:43:18.717 --> 02:43:20.198]  I'm going to let the Greeks vote on this.
[02:43:20.598 --> 02:43:36.625]  And this was a blackmail referendum, because it basically says, either you embrace genocidal austerity and years and years of suffering and grinding poverty and want and misery for the sake of the zombie bankers in Germany and France and Britain and Wall Street,
[02:43:37.325 --> 02:43:39.946]  Or, you're going to be cast into the outer darkness, right?
[02:43:39.966 --> 02:43:50.471]  You're going to be kicked out of the Euro, you're going to be kicked out of the European Union, and with your drachma, your drachma will go to zero, and your living standard will also go to zero, because that's what happens.
[02:43:50.851 --> 02:43:53.132]  Leaving a currency like this is catastrophic.
[02:43:53.712 --> 02:43:57.635]  Now this was, it's clear now, this was a maneuver by Papandreou, the IMF agent.
[02:43:58.015 --> 02:44:09.724]  Today he makes a speech in the Greek Parliament saying, I don't need to have a referendum as long as I can get the Greek right-wing opposition to agree with me in a national unity government.
[02:44:09.764 --> 02:44:10.504]  So let me stop you.
[02:44:10.544 --> 02:44:20.612]  What you're saying here is the banksters didn't want Greece to default until the Euro deal had gone through to give the banksters five trillion and more power over the states.
[02:44:21.352 --> 02:44:26.154]  Now that they've done that, now they do want to have it default to create even more carnage.
[02:44:26.814 --> 02:44:28.155]  No, I wouldn't put it that way.
[02:44:28.395 --> 02:44:39.419]  They're trying to stave off default by, as you say, this whole idea of the European Financial Stability Fund, which is about 500 trillion, sorry, 500 billion, and they want to use
[02:44:42.741 --> 02:44:46.723]  They want to use credit default swaps and other derivatives, which is the cause of the crisis.
[02:44:47.023 --> 02:44:53.367]  They want to use that to increase the firepower, as they say, of the EFSF, European Financial Stability Fund.
[02:44:53.387 --> 02:44:54.228]  This is all crazy.
[02:44:54.848 --> 02:44:58.270]  It's physically impossible for the Greeks to pay that debt.
[02:44:58.330 --> 02:44:59.211]  Exactly, Webster.
[02:44:59.251 --> 02:45:02.553]  It's physically impossible, and we've covered all this ground before.
[02:45:02.793 --> 02:45:23.449]  No, wait, wait, the new thing, this is what's coming at you, right, coming at all of us right now is this model where Papandreou says to the head of the New Democracy Party, who are the reactionaries, right, they're like the Republicans, this is a party that has been sitting on the sidelines and sniping, that's sort of what the Republicans do in Congress.
[02:45:23.869 --> 02:45:32.236]  Now, Papandreou turns to this guy Samaras and says to him, join me in a national unity government, it's going to be the
[02:45:32.816 --> 02:45:35.980]  PASOK, the socialists, and the reactionaries together.
[02:45:36.080 --> 02:45:38.624]  Now, what would that mean here in the U.S.?
[02:45:38.984 --> 02:45:44.371]  It would mean a national unity government of Obama and the Republicans.
[02:45:45.773 --> 02:45:47.035]  And where would that occur?
[02:45:47.175 --> 02:45:48.256]  Where could that take shape?
[02:45:49.277 --> 02:45:50.278]  The 12 tyrants.
[02:45:50.418 --> 02:45:51.099]  This is the thing.
[02:45:51.519 --> 02:45:55.261]  The 12 tyrants are going on behind the scenes, right?
[02:45:55.321 --> 02:46:06.028]  I'm talking about the Congressional Super Committee created by this rotten, despicable compromise that both parties agreed to after the debt crisis, right?
[02:46:06.068 --> 02:46:12.232]  At the end of July, beginning of August, with the threat by the reactionaries to drive the country into bankruptcy.
[02:46:12.573 --> 02:46:14.834]  One of the results of that was to create this group of 12
[02:46:16.515 --> 02:46:26.318]  Members of Congress, right, six Republican hacks, six Democratic hacks, right, six reactionary Republicans, and six Wall Street Democrats, and they're now working behind the scenes.
[02:46:26.358 --> 02:46:35.360]  The chairs are Patty Murray of Washington State, Wall Street Democrat, and Hen Sirling, Congressman from Texas, reactionary Republican.
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:41.522]  Now, if you look at the model that's being launched for Greece, of the national unity government,
[02:46:42.162 --> 02:46:47.388]  To push genocidal austerity, to ram genocidal austerity down the throats of people.
[02:46:47.848 --> 02:47:04.746]  The form in which this would occur here in the United States is on November 23rd, the 12 tyrants, the super committee, come forward with their solution, and they say, well, we were supposed to come up with 1.2 trillion of genocidal budget cuts against the American people, but
[02:47:04.946 --> 02:47:05.647]  That's not enough.
[02:47:05.887 --> 02:47:13.594]  We're going to have 4 trillion, 5 trillion of genocidal budget cuts so that we can please Standard & Poor's and Moody's and Fitch.
[02:47:14.015 --> 02:47:18.759]  And that would then be the precursor for some kind of a rotten deal along these lines.
[02:47:19.280 --> 02:47:22.943]  But Webster, we need to quantify this for new listeners.
[02:47:23.624 --> 02:47:33.996]  The point is, you can't pay back the $1,500 plus trillion in garbage that criminal government has signed us onto that isn't our debts.
[02:47:34.376 --> 02:47:36.218]  That zombie banks have created!
[02:47:36.339 --> 02:47:37.119]  Zombie banks!
[02:47:39.402 --> 02:47:47.369]  What the government did was to deregulate it, because again, from 1936 to 1982, derivatives were strictly illegal, and they should stay illegal.
[02:47:47.409 --> 02:47:53.955]  Yes, but then expanding on that, the bipartisan crooks that did this, bought and paid for by these criminal elements in Wall Street,
[02:47:54.796 --> 02:48:12.984]  They've now done this, and now they've got the Super Congress, and you notice they're slashing all the infrastructure, but then raising taxes to pay it to them, and the destination is the journey they mean to impoverish us in the post-industrial eugenics religion that they publicly follow.
[02:48:13.384 --> 02:48:18.906]  The tropism, as you've called it, the suicide bankers, who are just destroying the system in the name of total power.
[02:48:19.266 --> 02:48:20.467]  So the question is,
[02:48:21.699 --> 02:48:24.761]  Expanding on this, why do they want the war now?
[02:48:25.101 --> 02:48:26.562]  To make it a political diversion?
[02:48:26.862 --> 02:48:27.902]  I mean, what do you make of this?
[02:48:27.922 --> 02:48:30.924]  I have to keep going back to this Iran thing, because that's the big immediate deal.
[02:48:31.304 --> 02:48:40.009]  It'll be the patriotic diversion while we're in a new big war, while the bankers can, you know, rob us blind while we're busy watching this.
[02:48:40.369 --> 02:48:41.470]  The Israeli Prime Minister
[02:48:42.370 --> 02:48:45.153]  It's ordered an investigation into Iran leak.
[02:48:45.473 --> 02:48:51.739]  Kuwait paper says Benjamin Netanyahu believes the heads of the Mossad and Shin Bet may have leaked plans for an attack.
[02:48:52.519 --> 02:49:00.807]  Skousen's saying that's all just part of theater to act like all of Israel isn't involved in this so they can flush Netanyahu if they, you know, if this goes bad.
[02:49:01.087 --> 02:49:03.669]  But Netanyahu's gone and is basically saying they're getting ready to hit.
[02:49:03.970 --> 02:49:07.293]  So my question is, why do they want this war now?
[02:49:08.715 --> 02:49:14.719]  Well, whether they want it 100% beyond the theater, I think, is still a bit of an open question.
[02:49:14.739 --> 02:49:22.084]  And again, it's harder for them to do it, because we got rid of, at least we're on the way to getting rid of the weak, lame duck, Medvedev.
[02:49:22.484 --> 02:49:30.830]  And indeed, part of this whole scenario may be to prevent Putin from making the full comeback that they also hate and fear.
[02:49:31.290 --> 02:49:32.111]  But here's the idea.
[02:49:32.771 --> 02:49:38.636]  If you have such a war with Iran, the response of Iran is to close the Straits of Hormuz, right?
[02:49:38.676 --> 02:49:39.576]  Cutting off oil.
[02:49:40.137 --> 02:49:42.779]  That oil, if it's cut off, destroys who?
[02:49:43.079 --> 02:49:46.362]  It destroys Europe, Japan, and above all, China.
[02:49:47.022 --> 02:49:49.144]  And it drives up the price of the dollar.
[02:49:49.224 --> 02:49:55.508]  It creates a huge increase in the price of oil, and since the dollar is still a reserve currency,
[02:49:56.269 --> 02:50:07.076]  This means that you have a tremendous artificial demand for dollars, and they say, well, if we have a nice little war in the Persian Gulf, then the Iranians will do us the favor of cutting off the tanker traffic.
[02:50:07.676 --> 02:50:18.464]  That will mean the price of oil goes to $500 or $1,000 a barrel, and at that point the dollar overhang is absorbed out of the liquidity that's sloshing around.
[02:50:18.504 --> 02:50:20.205]  Yeah, all roads lead to war.
[02:50:21.045 --> 02:50:22.708]  It's the health of the state, as they say.
[02:50:22.728 --> 02:50:27.394]  This is what these type of crooks always do.
[02:50:27.674 --> 02:50:29.797]  Do you believe it's imminent, or are you saying it's not?
[02:50:30.663 --> 02:50:42.295]  To coin a phrase, turn the imperialist foreign war into a revolutionary civil conflict, let's say, to a revolutionary social movement at home, to embroider a previously existing phrase.
[02:50:42.736 --> 02:50:51.845]  In other words, the answer to all this, if you want to build mass resistance to this, you've got to do it with demands that have actual mass traction, and that's where you get
[02:50:52.566 --> 02:50:56.128]  The Wall Street sales tax of 1% means no cuts!
[02:50:56.749 --> 02:50:59.570]  No to the recipes coming from the 12 tyrants!
[02:50:59.590 --> 02:51:00.631]  Alright, stay there!
[02:51:01.051 --> 02:51:08.335]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan, and making its way across the entire U.S.
[02:51:08.375 --> 02:51:11.157]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[02:51:11.397 --> 02:51:14.159]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[02:51:14.399 --> 02:51:21.123]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S., unless you do something to protect yourself.
[02:51:21.383 --> 02:51:21.663]  How?

[02:52:06.838 --> 02:52:12.700]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[02:52:13.260 --> 02:52:15.021]  Number one, study the past.
[02:52:15.541 --> 02:52:17.302]  History really does repeat itself.
[02:52:17.942 --> 02:52:21.664]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:52:22.782 --> 02:52:25.064]  Number three, take decisive action.
[02:52:25.865 --> 02:52:29.147]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[02:52:29.728 --> 02:52:34.451]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[02:52:34.772 --> 02:52:38.214]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[02:52:38.775 --> 02:52:41.637]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[02:52:42.178 --> 02:52:45.820]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[02:52:46.661 --> 02:52:50.927]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[02:53:00.387 --> 02:53:04.610]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:53:04.930 --> 02:53:05.531]  Number 1.
[02:53:05.851 --> 02:53:08.993]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:53:09.274 --> 02:53:09.814]  Number 2.
[02:53:10.134 --> 02:53:14.678]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:53:15.018 --> 02:53:15.458]  It's true.
[02:53:15.758 --> 02:53:20.322]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:53:20.642 --> 02:53:21.182]  Number 3.
[02:53:21.463 --> 02:53:24.745]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:53:25.045 --> 02:53:28.748]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:53:28.948 --> 02:53:29.488]  Number 4.
[02:53:29.749 --> 02:53:32.110]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:53:32.511 --> 02:53:35.893]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:53:36.174 --> 02:53:36.394]  Number 5.
[02:53:36.974 --> 02:53:40.877]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:53:41.117 --> 02:53:45.881]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:53:46.161 --> 02:53:50.187]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:50.347 --> 02:53:51.909]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:53:52.129 --> 02:53:54.192]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:53:54.392 --> 02:53:56.716]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:54:28.733 --> 02:54:32.717]  I'm taking the fight, I said I'll never give it up
[02:54:47.359 --> 02:54:49.442]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:54:49.502 --> 02:54:53.867]  By the way, we had the donation line where it kind of went into voicemail Hades.
[02:54:54.327 --> 02:54:59.333]  Now it just goes directly to the InfoWars crews if you want to donate to the InfoWars 2011.
[02:55:01.275 --> 02:55:03.037]  Moneybomb, it is available right now.
[02:55:03.057 --> 02:55:05.480]  Infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:09.284]  You can also go to Infowars.com and donate if you believe in this operation.
[02:55:09.644 --> 02:55:10.105]  It's simple.
[02:55:10.125 --> 02:55:12.267]  The globalists take your money and use it against you.
[02:55:12.527 --> 02:55:19.014]  We're saying donate if you want us to expand the nightly news, expand the shows, expand the reporters and everything we're doing.
[02:55:19.835 --> 02:55:31.243]  The most important thing to do, and a lot of folks are watching it right now, is to go to InfoWars.com and send the link out that talks about the 24 or 27 hour transmission out to everyone you know.
[02:55:31.823 --> 02:55:36.526]  Again, it is available right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:36.786 --> 02:55:40.069]  And let me just tell you the schedule verbally here for everybody.
[02:55:40.109 --> 02:55:41.109]  Joel Scalzon was on.
[02:55:41.129 --> 02:55:42.110]  We're with Webster Tarpley.
[02:55:42.370 --> 02:55:43.571]  Catherine Albrecht's coming up.
[02:55:43.631 --> 02:55:47.694]  George Norrie, David Icke, Mike Adams, Tex Mars,
[02:55:50.015 --> 02:56:01.059]  Corbett Report folks, Springmeyer, Aaron Dykes, Paul Watson, Richard Reeves, Gerald Salente, Alan Watt, Jim Mars, and Bob Chapman, and many others.
[02:56:01.079 --> 02:56:11.283]  We're broadcasting right through, right through until 2 o'clock tomorrow, 2 o'clock tomorrow, 2 o'clock tomorrow, and then of course 2 p.m.
[02:56:11.303 --> 02:56:15.024]  Central, and then of course we have a Sunday transmission 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:15.044 --> 02:56:16.445]  and back on Monday.
[02:56:17.423 --> 02:56:17.603]  here.
[02:56:47.984 --> 02:56:50.426]  You know Webster, I've studied what the Communist Chinese do.
[02:56:51.066 --> 02:56:52.628]  I don't know why the left loves them so much.
[02:56:52.668 --> 02:56:54.349]  They execute homosexuals over there.
[02:56:54.369 --> 02:57:02.777]  I saw some person dressed up in a Mao outfit at an Occupy Wall Street deal saying he loves Mao because he's gay and America doesn't like him.
[02:57:02.817 --> 02:57:03.998]  They go over there, they murder him.
[02:57:04.018 --> 02:57:06.881]  I'm not talking about the general Chinese people, but the government.
[02:57:07.761 --> 02:57:11.344]  Uh, we've got, uh, you've got Russia, incredibly corrupt.
[02:57:11.364 --> 02:57:13.105]  I mean, I don't romanticize any of this.
[02:57:13.466 --> 02:57:15.127]  You've got the corrupt banks running us.
[02:57:15.187 --> 02:57:19.350]  It's just all a bunch of crooks fighting with each other, while we the people are on the bottom of it.
[02:57:19.590 --> 02:57:22.753]  You've got the Iranians that have had their government overthrown over and over again.
[02:57:23.173 --> 02:57:24.714]  You've got all this stuff happening.
[02:57:25.775 --> 02:57:31.560]  Uh, and, uh, I agree the Western elite is in crisis, but so are the others, Webster.
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:33.521]  And I just see this going from bad to worse.
[02:57:33.561 --> 02:57:34.382]  What's your comment on that?
[02:57:34.980 --> 02:57:37.541]  Let's look at the tactical and strategic situation.
[02:57:37.982 --> 02:57:39.362]  We have the bad, right?
[02:57:39.482 --> 02:57:47.387]  The bad would be Sarkozy, Merkel, and this crew with lots and lots of others attached to them.
[02:57:47.807 --> 02:57:48.888]  And then we have the worst.
[02:57:49.368 --> 02:57:53.190]  And the worst are Obama, Hillary, Geithner, Bernanke,
[02:57:53.610 --> 02:57:57.452]  We've got Cameron in London, we've got Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
[02:57:57.652 --> 02:58:05.636]  Those guys are the worst, because they represent the most virulent, destructive form of speculative finance capital the world has ever seen, right?
[02:58:05.916 --> 02:58:07.697]  The Derivative Centre, London.
[02:58:07.757 --> 02:58:13.700]  I was on TV yesterday with a guy who said, London is the centre, the premier financial centre of the world.
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:16.722]  And they mean to keep that, okay?
[02:58:16.842 --> 02:58:18.082]  And the world be damned.
[02:58:18.443 --> 02:58:27.609]  So, when you see the bad fighting the worst, it's something good, first of all, because it diminishes the net amount of evil in the world.
[02:58:27.949 --> 02:58:32.492]  But at that point, it's better to see the bad win out over the worst.
[02:58:32.972 --> 02:58:37.735]  And specifically, the fight is about this Wall Street sales... Stay there five more minutes, Webster.
[02:58:37.775 --> 02:58:38.356]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:38.376 --> 02:58:38.736]  Stay with us.
[02:58:42.660 --> 02:58:44.521]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.122 --> 02:58:48.384]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.666 --> 02:58:57.129]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:58:58.310 --> 02:59:03.073]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:59:03.453 --> 02:59:10.258]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:59:12.182 --> 02:59:28.332]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit They put a diamond gusset in the crotch Where you need it most Blue diamond gussets got it

[02:59:34.252 --> 02:59:36.813]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:59:37.133 --> 02:59:43.394]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.

[02:59:48.836 --> 02:59:49.696]  Others don't.
[02:59:52.048 --> 02:59:54.913]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.635 --> 02:59:58.861]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:24.793 --> 03:00:27.954]  We are into our number four, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:28.434 --> 03:00:31.074]  Katherine Albrecht is going to be joining us.
[03:00:31.554 --> 03:00:34.275]  She's an expert on the Big Brother Takeover of Society.
[03:00:34.295 --> 03:00:37.976]  I want to cover the waterfront with her joining us.
[03:00:38.016 --> 03:00:43.877]  And then we've got Mike Adams coming up, David Icke, George Norrie, Tex Mars, Alfred Adask.
[03:00:43.897 --> 03:00:48.678]  I mean, the list just goes on and on with this 27-hour marathon worldwide transmission.
[03:00:49.940 --> 03:00:53.122]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.com.
[03:00:53.422 --> 03:00:54.483]  Finishing up with Webster.
[03:00:54.503 --> 03:00:57.666]  Webster, yes, I understand the tax on Wall Street.
[03:00:58.406 --> 03:00:59.707]  But see, that's a general thing.
[03:00:59.727 --> 03:01:03.490]  When I go down to these Wall Street events, they tell me, get your Ron Paul signs out of here.
[03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:04.510]  This is freedom.
[03:01:04.911 --> 03:01:06.232]  And we love George Soros.
[03:01:06.792 --> 03:01:09.434]  And we're going to tax anybody making $100,000 or more.
[03:01:09.994 --> 03:01:13.037]  I understand some of the groups are saying a speculation tax.
[03:01:13.757 --> 03:01:15.698]  Those guys are on the Soros payroll.
[03:01:15.898 --> 03:01:18.240]  Look, I would suggest people to do three things.
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:22.723]  Let's highlight one election next week, right?
[03:01:23.523 --> 03:01:25.024]  Election day next Tuesday.
[03:01:25.645 --> 03:01:26.685]  City of Philadelphia.
[03:01:26.765 --> 03:01:27.806]  County of Philadelphia.
[03:01:28.246 --> 03:01:28.627]  Sheriff.
[03:01:29.307 --> 03:01:32.350]  Sherry Hunkala running for Sheriff of Philadelphia.
[03:01:32.390 --> 03:01:33.871]  What's the problem she sees?
[03:01:34.311 --> 03:01:36.553]  Bank of America steals people's homes.
[03:01:36.874 --> 03:01:40.517]  They have robo-judges, robo-cops, robo-signers, robo-sheriffs.
[03:01:40.897 --> 03:01:42.238]  They come and steal your home.
[03:01:42.499 --> 03:01:43.760]  Maybe you have no mortgage.
[03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:45.141]  Maybe you missed one payment.
[03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:47.022]  They're there to steal it, right?
[03:01:47.122 --> 03:01:50.263]  Private property at risk from the attacks of Bank of America.
[03:01:50.623 --> 03:01:53.484]  So Sherry Hunkle is running for Sheriff of Philadelphia.
[03:01:53.844 --> 03:01:57.085]  Her platform is no foreclosures, no evictions.
[03:01:57.105 --> 03:01:57.805]  No, no, I love it.
[03:01:57.845 --> 03:01:58.705]  That's solutions.
[03:01:58.785 --> 03:02:02.287]  When banks break the law, grand juries should indict them and they should go to prison.
[03:02:02.847 --> 03:02:03.207]  Right.
[03:02:03.467 --> 03:02:07.928]  And they should have the tens of trillions they've stolen clawed back and paid back into the Treasury.
[03:02:08.068 --> 03:02:09.329]  I totally agree with you.
[03:02:09.709 --> 03:02:11.289]  That's a real solution.
[03:02:11.650 --> 03:02:12.610]  Arrest the bankers.
[03:02:13.203 --> 03:02:19.427]  Alright, but this is also, don't carry out their orders to steal people's homes and throw American families out on the streets.
[03:02:19.487 --> 03:02:21.349]  This is a lady who's been homeless herself.
[03:02:21.649 --> 03:02:22.770]  She's a long-term activist.
[03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:26.973]  So I urge people to support Sherry Hunkala for Sheriff of Philadelphia.
[03:02:27.013 --> 03:02:28.594]  She needs money, she needs volunteers.
[03:02:28.614 --> 03:02:34.558]  Yeah, but I'm saying that general idea, Webster, of getting good sheriffs in, Sheriff Mack has, of course, pioneered that idea.
[03:02:34.858 --> 03:02:35.999]  That's a great idea.
[03:02:36.658 --> 03:02:40.101]  Okay, number two, if you're in Ohio, vote against Kasich.
[03:02:40.181 --> 03:02:42.022]  Kasich wants to bust all the unions.
[03:02:42.402 --> 03:02:48.767]  If you bust all the unions, for God's sake, then there are no mass organizations that can resist totalitarian government.
[03:02:49.007 --> 03:02:54.071]  What kind of a logic is it that says, smash the unions, and then everything will be hunky-dory?
[03:02:54.291 --> 03:03:03.198]  Those are the only things that come even close to being mass organizations that could call a general strike to stop a war, to stop a fascist coup, or God knows what.
[03:03:03.738 --> 03:03:10.081]  And the third thing, if you're a Democrat in particular, or an Independent, and you're interested in the Obama question, right?
[03:03:10.101 --> 03:03:20.826]  If you want to register your opposition to Obama, that he should be dumped as a failure in a Wall Street puppet, primaryobamanow.com, primaryobamanow.com.
[03:03:21.186 --> 03:03:27.509]  So there, I think, between those, among those three things, just about, there's something for everybody that they can do, right?
[03:03:27.529 --> 03:03:29.430]  Because the big thing is action.
[03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.910]  And again,
[03:03:30.250 --> 03:03:37.480]  If you don't like the fact that Soros' facilitators are dominating the Occupy where you are, get out there with the program!
[03:03:37.620 --> 03:03:46.153]  Wall Street sales tax, stop foreclosures, student loan amnesty, cancel it all, no cuts, no to the 12 tyrants, and
[03:03:46.633 --> 03:03:48.014]  Seize the Federal Reserve!
[03:03:48.074 --> 03:03:50.555]  Let's start laying a glove on the Federal Reserve!
[03:03:50.935 --> 03:03:51.915]  Nationalize them!
[03:03:52.195 --> 03:03:56.757]  Make them cough up $1 trillion of 0% 100-year credit.
[03:03:57.057 --> 03:04:01.139]  We can rebuild the United States with successive blocks of those trillions.
[03:04:01.179 --> 03:04:05.400]  We need to create 30 million new productive jobs at union wages.
[03:04:05.500 --> 03:04:09.202]  And we're sick of austerity, because the austerity goes to the bankers, right?
[03:04:09.242 --> 03:04:11.843]  We don't want genocide against the American people.
[03:04:12.383 --> 03:04:14.964]  The budget will never be balanced with those methods, right?
[03:04:14.984 --> 03:04:17.684]  The champion of that austerity is Papandreou.
[03:04:17.944 --> 03:04:20.785]  The more he cuts, the bigger the deficit gets.
[03:04:20.885 --> 03:04:25.026]  How many times, how many people do we have to kill before that becomes obvious, right?
[03:04:25.066 --> 03:04:26.546]  Schwarzenegger, the same story.
[03:04:26.806 --> 03:04:32.748]  And remember, today is the day called by the National Nurses United and other groups
[03:04:33.268 --> 03:04:36.570]  Get out there and fight for the Wall Street sales tax, whatever you want to call it.
[03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:38.531]  The main thing is, it goes to the U.S.
[03:04:38.571 --> 03:04:42.854]  Treasury, and it goes to the states, so that the states can maintain vital services.
[03:04:43.154 --> 03:04:51.198]  We don't need to have cops, teachers, healthcare workers, first responders fired, simply because Koch and Soros want their bailouts.
[03:04:51.338 --> 03:04:53.560]  Alright, Webster, thanks for spending time with us.
[03:04:53.620 --> 03:04:55.141]  Ladies and gentlemen, Catherine Albrecht.
[03:04:55.161 --> 03:04:55.881]  Best of luck, Alex.
[03:04:56.081 --> 03:04:56.982]  Thank you, Webster.
[03:04:57.062 --> 03:04:57.902]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:58.503 --> 03:04:59.203]  We'll be right back.

[03:05:51.753 --> 03:05:54.154]  Taking back America's healthcare, one American at a time.
[03:06:00.999 --> 03:06:05.021]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[03:06:05.441 --> 03:06:06.681]  Everyone can feel it.
[03:06:06.942 --> 03:06:15.385]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[03:06:15.845 --> 03:06:18.987]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[03:06:19.267 --> 03:06:20.167]  But take heart.
[03:06:20.187 --> 03:06:23.829]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[03:06:24.109 --> 03:06:29.091]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[03:06:29.511 --> 03:06:33.054]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[03:06:33.354 --> 03:06:34.795]  The globalists are scared.
[03:06:35.076 --> 03:06:36.076]  They've overreached.
[03:06:36.417 --> 03:06:39.559]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:41.961]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:06:42.181 --> 03:06:48.146]  Download the thousands of special video reports, e-books, and more, and get them out to everyone you know.
[03:06:48.346 --> 03:06:55.052]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and every other globalist propaganda platform.
[03:06:55.312 --> 03:06:57.414]  We are going to use their system against them.
[03:06:57.554 --> 03:07:00.536]  The InfoWar now goes into high gear!
[03:07:00.937 --> 03:07:02.918]  Is your credit card debt out of control?
[03:07:03.098 --> 03:07:05.580]  Are you in over your head dealing with monthly payments?
[03:07:05.881 --> 03:07:09.423]  There's a powerful secret that credit card companies don't want you to know.
[03:07:09.704 --> 03:07:16.629]  If you have credit card debt, you have the power to settle that debt for a fraction of what you owe, cutting your payments by up to half or more.
[03:07:16.849 --> 03:07:22.454]  That's bad news for credit card companies, but it's great news for you, and we'd like to offer you free information
[03:07:22.714 --> 03:07:23.195]  We're good to go.
[03:07:40.435 --> 03:07:45.057]  For the secret your credit card companies don't want you to know, call National Debt Relief today at 1-800-460-5733.
[03:07:45.077 --> 03:07:45.217]  1-800-460-5733.
[03:07:45.257 --> 03:07:47.978]  This free information is available only for a limited time.
[03:07:47.998 --> 03:07:48.378]  Change your life.
[03:07:48.438 --> 03:07:48.938]  Call 1-800-460-5733 today.
[03:08:02.526 --> 03:08:08.558]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.159 --> 03:08:12.145]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:25.825 --> 03:08:32.309]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into the fourth hour of this 27-hour transmission.
[03:08:33.149 --> 03:08:42.175]  I am your guest host, I guess, for this hour, Alex Jones, because coming up later in the middle of the night, we're going to have Aaron Dykes as a guest host.
[03:08:42.195 --> 03:08:46.357]  We're going to have Paul Watson as a guest host as well.
[03:08:47.078 --> 03:08:51.380]  But guest hosting with us this hour is Katherine Albrecht, Dr. Katherine Albrecht.
[03:08:51.880 --> 03:08:53.601]  Her website's katherinealbrecht.com.
[03:08:54.827 --> 03:08:58.430]  She's a popular commentator and, of course, radio personality here on Genesis.
[03:08:58.890 --> 03:09:01.573]  She's authored and co-authored six books and films.
[03:09:02.293 --> 03:09:07.578]  And, of course, she's also a Harvard graduate studying all of this garbage.
[03:09:07.898 --> 03:09:12.041]  She's helped really expose the whole RFID system, the police state control grid.
[03:09:13.783 --> 03:09:20.789]  My only problem today is really getting into the full magnitude
[03:09:23.753 --> 03:09:31.221]  Of just open flaunting of classical Big Brother corruption and tyranny in this country.
[03:09:33.343 --> 03:09:36.966]  It really is staggering to behold it.
[03:09:39.429 --> 03:09:45.235]  All over the nation, I've known for 13 years, they've put up street lights that have cameras and microphones hidden in them.
[03:09:47.265 --> 03:09:52.809]  For 17 years they've listened to all the cell phones in real time and tracked everywhere you go for for 40 years.
[03:09:52.849 --> 03:09:54.310]  It'll be 40 years next year.
[03:09:55.231 --> 03:10:00.254]  Worldwide and industrialized nations they've taken blood at birth and put it in a secret UN database.
[03:10:00.554 --> 03:10:02.896]  We of course broke that 16 years ago with the documents.
[03:10:02.936 --> 03:10:04.117]  Now it's news the last three.
[03:10:06.761 --> 03:10:19.414]  RFID, tracker chips, smart dust, Google watching people over microphones and cameras on phones, schools watching children, telescreens everywhere saying spy on your neighbors, only trust the government.
[03:10:20.135 --> 03:10:24.419]  It's like waking up in a nightmare science fiction movie is the way I've described it.
[03:10:25.393 --> 03:10:30.417]  And now they've gone from denying they were spying on us without warrants to just saying, this is the way it is.
[03:10:30.517 --> 03:10:37.623]  And Katherine Albrecht has a great way, you know, with words to really break down how you're not just going to Google and getting something from them.
[03:10:37.983 --> 03:10:40.085]  They're finding out who you are, what you're doing.
[03:10:40.105 --> 03:10:42.487]  They're creating algorithms on you.
[03:10:42.527 --> 03:10:46.390]  They're integrating with larger systems and literally be able to predict the future.
[03:10:48.692 --> 03:10:49.933]  All of that is going on.
[03:10:51.548 --> 03:10:53.511]  And that's why the elite are on such power trips.
[03:10:53.531 --> 03:11:01.361]  They admit now they see it as a type of crystal ball system to control the population.
[03:11:03.581 --> 03:11:04.842]  I also saw a report yesterday.
[03:11:04.882 --> 03:11:05.962]  Richard Reeves brought it to me.
[03:11:05.982 --> 03:11:09.044]  I was going to cover it on the nightly news and then it disappeared out of my stack.
[03:11:09.804 --> 03:11:17.228]  But he had reports that they're actually talking about pulling the smart meters in California because they use wireless cell phone technology type systems because of the health effects.
[03:11:17.248 --> 03:11:23.491]  California has been forced, along with a lot of Europe, to admit that they're causing problems and cell phones are linked to cancer.
[03:11:25.665 --> 03:11:32.270]  Also, we'll get into just a lot of other technological developments that have taken place and towards the end of the hour, we'll open the phones up.
[03:11:32.290 --> 03:11:37.654]  We're going to have some sections over the next 24 hours we've got left in the 27-hour transmission.
[03:11:38.951 --> 03:11:42.733]  Where we are going to just have nothing but phones that are open.
[03:11:43.613 --> 03:11:45.614]  But going to Catherine Albrecht.
[03:11:47.034 --> 03:11:51.736]  She's also fighting and praise God, hopefully winning a fight against breast cancer right now.
[03:11:52.497 --> 03:11:55.378]  So she might give us an update on that today as well.
[03:11:55.678 --> 03:11:57.219]  Catherine, good to have you here with us today.
[03:11:58.479 --> 03:12:01.080]  Well hey Alex, it's terrific to be on with you.
[03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:03.180]  I can't believe you're doing 27 hours.
[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:04.680]  I think it's fantastic.
[03:12:04.780 --> 03:12:07.401]  You could probably do 100 hours and keep going.
[03:12:08.201 --> 03:12:13.142]  You're like the Energizer Buddy out there and I love it because there's just so much we've got to be covering.
[03:12:13.522 --> 03:12:20.784]  You know, I'm out here in New Hampshire where we got hit by this October, what they're calling a great Halloween power outage.
[03:12:22.485 --> 03:12:24.827]  I'm on day six of no power.
[03:12:25.488 --> 03:12:29.050]  And the reason I bring that up, I'm actually broadcasting, I'm not out of my studio.
[03:12:29.130 --> 03:12:36.056]  I had to actually find somebody with power and get an opportunity to get online and connect to you this way.
[03:12:36.496 --> 03:12:40.199]  But there's a couple of things about this power outage I want to bring to people's attention.
[03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:49.547]  That when the powers that be choose to shut off our power, and I'm not implying that's what happened up here because we've got downed trees across our power lines.
[03:12:49.987 --> 03:12:57.896]  But if someone at some point says, hey, you know what, we're going to turn off your internet, we're going to turn off your power, we are going to be helpless.
[03:12:58.457 --> 03:13:06.566]  It is amazing to me watching what happens when we had about two-thirds of the state of New Hampshire and virtually all of New England without power.
[03:13:07.006 --> 03:13:09.308]  How everybody goes crazy.
[03:13:09.448 --> 03:13:16.933]  And you know, even those generators, people say, you get prepared to get a generator, the lines at our gas stations are stretching a half a mile.
[03:13:17.293 --> 03:13:23.117]  People were saying it was taking 45 minutes to an hour just to get gasoline because everybody's got to refill.
[03:13:23.157 --> 03:13:26.359]  I mean, those generators to take in 10, 15 gallons of gas a day.
[03:13:26.499 --> 03:13:28.901]  And if they shut that off, people are going to be in the dark.
[03:13:28.961 --> 03:13:29.822]  They're going to be cold.
[03:13:30.242 --> 03:13:34.245]  And let me tell you, more importantly, they're not going to have access to the internet.
[03:13:34.325 --> 03:13:34.565]  And that's
[03:13:34.565 --> 03:13:35.886]  That's been the hardest part for me.
[03:13:36.287 --> 03:13:47.556]  I've got kerosene, I've got heat, I've got water, I've got all the stuff I need, but boy, I'll tell you, when you are out of communication range and you cannot use that internet, it is mind-blowing what they can do.
[03:13:48.117 --> 03:13:49.858]  And then you take a look at the smart meters.
[03:13:50.139 --> 03:13:53.462]  You mentioned that at the opening of the show, which is such an important topic.
[03:13:53.942 --> 03:14:01.064]  Because the smart meters are about more than just making it easier for the power company to read your electric meter and send you a bill.
[03:14:01.504 --> 03:14:15.727]  The smart meters have an incredible amount of power to selectively shut off appliances in your home, to communicate with and have your appliances communicate back with the power company and say, hey, she ate three pieces of toast.
[03:14:16.147 --> 03:14:33.987]  Today instead of one what's going on did she have a visitor over I mean that level of invasiveness and now we just had a new story come out telling us that the smart meter can even determine what show you're watching on TV or what DVD that they actually monitor the amount of power that
[03:14:34.447 --> 03:14:44.735]  That goes through your television to make light and dark images, and on the basis of that they could run an algorithm and say exactly what TV show or movie you're watching.
[03:14:45.256 --> 03:14:47.197]  Unbelievable, and that's all coming.
[03:14:47.277 --> 03:14:50.260]  So, you know, when the power goes out, you start really thinking about that grid.
[03:14:51.946 --> 03:14:57.351]  Well, first they came out with smart meters five, six years ago and said, don't worry, we won't control your thermostat.
[03:14:57.411 --> 03:14:59.112]  Now they admit they're going to be doing it.
[03:14:59.652 --> 03:15:05.317]  And then they're also coming out with, as you know, data transmission down power lines.
[03:15:05.377 --> 03:15:13.184]  They're now building circuits in different appliances where that data transmission over power line couples in and spies on what you're doing.
[03:15:13.604 --> 03:15:16.125]  They're coming out and government buildings are testing it, of course.
[03:15:16.505 --> 03:15:20.926]  A flicker rate with fluorescent light bulbs that communicates with your computer.
[03:15:20.986 --> 03:15:22.226]  That's Associated Press.
[03:15:22.827 --> 03:15:25.107]  But let's get into the free speech issues first.
[03:15:25.547 --> 03:15:28.768]  Now we've seen David Cameron come out and say we're going to have to restrict free speech.
[03:15:29.268 --> 03:15:32.929]  We've seen the bill introduced, even CNET News, as you know, on Monday admitted.
[03:15:32.949 --> 03:15:39.331]  They have members of Congress saying this new piracy bill is the end of the Internet.
[03:15:39.391 --> 03:15:40.431]  No judge, no jury.
[03:15:40.471 --> 03:15:41.852]  They just shut down your website.
[03:15:42.916 --> 03:15:43.477]  I don't know.
[03:16:00.729 --> 03:16:03.212]  Under law, fair use, everything.
[03:16:03.552 --> 03:16:04.373]  It's commentary.
[03:16:05.514 --> 03:16:11.600]  Companies are registering even their commercials and things and it automatically flags it and won't let us post it.
[03:16:11.980 --> 03:16:18.026]  I mean that's the kind of smart systems they've got to surveil AI everything we're doing.
[03:16:18.066 --> 03:16:23.252]  An example is police are saying they're gonna get the system that's built that's being built into the new iPhones where
[03:16:24.873 --> 03:16:34.835]  They just broadcast a feed or a certain type of light to where they take control of your smartphones where you can't videotape them.
[03:16:35.955 --> 03:16:37.336]  That's what the globalists are doing.
[03:16:37.636 --> 03:16:47.258]  They're engineering into all the tech through global conventions the systems that surveil, control us, and then we pay for it when we purchase the product.
[03:16:47.538 --> 03:16:48.818]  I mean, it's so diabolical.
[03:16:49.946 --> 03:16:52.867]  Yeah, they built it in, and you know what I always clarify, Alex?
[03:16:52.947 --> 03:17:02.849]  Because as a privacy advocate, somebody who really works on those privacy issues, I always make it clear to people, listen, privacy is not an end, it's a means.
[03:17:03.450 --> 03:17:08.631]  You know, privacy, or taking your privacy away, is a means of achieving something else.
[03:17:09.171 --> 03:17:14.193]  And in the case of us, the citizens, what your privacy does is it gives you independence.
[03:17:14.513 --> 03:17:16.033]  It gives you anonymity.
[03:17:16.453 --> 03:17:18.514]  It gives you freedom of action.
[03:17:18.654 --> 03:17:19.654]  It gives you freedom.
[03:17:20.175 --> 03:17:23.576]  And so, you know, when people say, well, why do you really care who knows blah blah blah?
[03:17:23.636 --> 03:17:27.517]  I see that, you know, I personally care, but even if you don't care, that's not the point.
[03:17:28.077 --> 03:17:30.860]  Privacy is a form of power.
[03:17:30.980 --> 03:17:32.402]  It is a means to an end.
[03:17:32.602 --> 03:17:37.527]  And if someone takes away your privacy, the next thing they will take away is your freedom.
[03:17:37.547 --> 03:17:38.508]  And I'll give you an example.
[03:17:38.888 --> 03:17:42.552]  Why is it people are so up in arms about gun registration?
[03:17:43.012 --> 03:17:52.323]  The reason people get upset about gun registration is they know that once the government knows who has the guns, then when the time comes, they'll go knocking on those people's doors and take the guns.
[03:17:52.764 --> 03:17:53.765]  Exactly, let me stop you.
[03:17:53.785 --> 03:17:58.230]  They'll come take them, and that's happened in every country where this has happened, from Nazi Germany to Australia.
[03:17:59.284 --> 03:17:59.864]  Exactly.
[03:18:00.705 --> 03:18:08.688]  Privacy is really your safety and governments that want your privacy are always building intelligence on you.
[03:18:08.968 --> 03:18:10.808]  It doesn't matter you did nothing wrong.
[03:18:11.049 --> 03:18:12.289]  Maybe they want your farm.
[03:18:12.529 --> 03:18:13.630]  Maybe they want your wife.
[03:18:14.090 --> 03:18:18.591]  Maybe they want to kill you and take your kids and press them into the Roman army.
[03:18:18.611 --> 03:18:23.153]  You know, the point is that it's not that we want our privacy because we're bad.
[03:18:23.453 --> 03:18:27.455]  It's because historically the bad guys want the intelligence on you.
[03:18:29.261 --> 03:18:40.968]  Well, that's beautifully said, and in the same way that you want to hang on to your privacy so you can hang on to your independence and your belongings and your freedoms, they want to take it away for the same reason.
[03:18:40.988 --> 03:18:44.470]  The reason people want to know everything you buy is not because they want to know everything you buy.
[03:18:44.490 --> 03:18:56.497]  It's because at some point in the future, they're going to want to be able to do exactly what Hitler did during World War II, or leading up to it, which is to say certain people just don't qualify to buy food.
[03:18:56.917 --> 03:19:01.442]  You know, they said the Jews are not allowed to buy bread and milk and eggs.
[03:19:01.783 --> 03:19:06.528]  Yeah, you can go buy other stuff, but, you know, the basic foodstuffs, if you're Jewish, you couldn't buy them.
[03:19:06.548 --> 03:19:08.090]  Well, it's currency controls.
[03:19:08.550 --> 03:19:11.233]  It's always an internal control system.
[03:19:11.274 --> 03:19:14.117]  Now the TSA's asking about a few silver coins.
[03:19:14.778 --> 03:19:17.621]  But if you expand into that, now they've passed a law
[03:19:17.881 --> 03:19:18.021]  We're
[03:19:36.027 --> 03:19:38.128]  Who cares if the government knows everything I'm doing?
[03:19:38.388 --> 03:19:40.609]  The point is they want to destroy you.
[03:19:40.949 --> 03:19:42.530]  They want to shut you down.
[03:19:42.850 --> 03:19:44.291]  This is scorched earth.
[03:19:44.311 --> 03:19:45.011]  Catherine, stay there.
[03:19:45.031 --> 03:19:45.412]  Incredible.
[03:19:45.632 --> 03:19:48.973]  I want you to continue along that point about why this is so important.
[03:19:49.574 --> 03:19:51.355]  Dealing with the currency controls.
[03:19:51.395 --> 03:19:52.695]  I'm calling it currency controls.
[03:19:53.176 --> 03:20:00.019]  What's the term called where they start tracking all the money and transactions in a country always during inflationary periods?
[03:20:00.259 --> 03:20:01.280]  It'll pop in my head in a moment.
[03:20:01.300 --> 03:20:01.640]  Gold.
[03:20:02.001 --> 03:20:03.282]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[03:20:03.522 --> 03:20:09.607]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[03:20:09.808 --> 03:20:13.631]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[03:20:13.991 --> 03:20:15.873]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[03:20:15.933 --> 03:20:18.215]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[03:20:18.355 --> 03:20:25.862]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[03:20:25.902 --> 03:20:26.743]  We're good to go.
[03:20:41.218 --> 03:20:46.839]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report of Fed hopes you'll never see.

[03:21:01.468 --> 03:21:09.655]  Whatever winter activity you enjoy, from snowmobiling, snowshoeing, skiing, or camping, there's inherent danger that you may find yourself having to stay warm.
[03:21:09.936 --> 03:21:14.320]  Be ready with Instafire, a revolutionary safe, simple, and versatile fire starter.
[03:21:14.540 --> 03:21:16.862]  Instafire is a patented blend of volcanic rock,
[03:21:17.042 --> 03:21:17.322]  I think so.
[03:21:47.022 --> 03:21:48.122]  We're good to go.
[03:22:00.034 --> 03:22:05.539]  There are limitless ways to go into business for yourself, but most involve substantial capital and risk.
[03:22:05.879 --> 03:22:09.002]  Our InfoWarsTeam.com operation is different.

[03:22:50.636 --> 03:22:52.920]  That's MZ and Infowarsteam.com.
[03:22:53.120 --> 03:22:56.827]  I only promote products that I truly believe in, and these are phenomenal.
[03:22:56.907 --> 03:22:59.391]  Whatever you do, visit Infowarsteam.com.
[03:23:00.546 --> 03:23:01.666]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:23:02.026 --> 03:23:07.407]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[03:23:07.847 --> 03:23:11.208]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[03:23:11.588 --> 03:23:14.548]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift.

[03:24:34.385 --> 03:24:36.886]  Then, when we start the next hour, it's going to be open phones.
[03:24:36.906 --> 03:24:39.268]  We'll go to our phone system here in-house.
[03:24:39.288 --> 03:24:40.729]  This is going to be commercial-free.
[03:24:51.594 --> 03:24:56.198]  And for breaks, I'll play little special reports by Darren McBreen.
[03:24:56.879 --> 03:25:00.222]  We've got some other things lined up so I can take breaks from time to time.
[03:25:00.242 --> 03:25:13.073]  And we do have David Icke, George Norrie coming up, Mike Adams, Tex Mars, and so many others, Gerald Cilente, you name it, Fritz Springmeier, Jim Mars, Chapman, Alan Watt.
[03:25:14.252 --> 03:25:15.533]  The list goes on and on.
[03:25:15.553 --> 03:25:20.938]  And we're going to premiere some videos, special interviews here as well coming up.
[03:25:21.759 --> 03:25:25.121]  It is the 2011 Money Bomb.
[03:25:25.141 --> 03:25:26.723]  I think I should have brought up to Tarpley.
[03:25:26.743 --> 03:25:27.323]  He's been down here.
[03:25:27.363 --> 03:25:27.784]  He's seen it.
[03:25:28.184 --> 03:25:33.409]  Our full studios and what we've built in the last four years with your support with the last three Money Bombs.
[03:25:34.049 --> 03:25:35.591]  And we've got a lot of donations coming in.
[03:25:35.631 --> 03:25:36.912]  People are calling to donate at 888.
[03:25:38.473 --> 03:25:39.113]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[03:25:39.133 --> 03:25:45.335]  I'd like to thank you for your donation and your continued support of InfoWars and what we're doing here.
[03:25:45.355 --> 03:25:46.256]  We're all in this together.
[03:25:46.276 --> 03:25:47.796]  888-2-5-3-3-1-3-9.
[03:25:47.816 --> 03:25:55.099]  And, of course, you can also go donate at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com or just InfoWars.com.
[03:25:55.119 --> 03:25:56.439]  You can find it right there.
[03:25:56.459 --> 03:26:01.721]  And you can also spread the link to the 27-hour broadcast of the video feed.
[03:26:02.181 --> 03:26:03.662]  That's up at InfoWars.com.
[03:26:03.682 --> 03:26:05.982]  So please help spread the word about that as well.
[03:26:06.043 --> 03:26:06.523]  Now, Catherine,
[03:26:07.663 --> 03:26:08.644]  You just went to the heart of this.
[03:26:08.684 --> 03:26:11.187]  They're setting up capital controls inside the country.
[03:26:11.527 --> 03:26:13.889]  They're making it hard to get your money outside the country.
[03:26:14.750 --> 03:26:16.392]  They're tracking everything we do.
[03:26:16.692 --> 03:26:18.334]  There's a reason we had privacy.
[03:26:18.354 --> 03:26:20.576]  There's a reason we had a Fourth Amendment.
[03:26:20.896 --> 03:26:22.918]  And now it's basically completely gone.
[03:26:22.959 --> 03:26:26.722]  I mean, the stuff that we were worried about 10 years ago, it's already surpassed that.
[03:26:26.742 --> 03:26:28.064]  And you were bringing up this fact that
[03:26:29.520 --> 03:26:31.321]  Again, it's not us that has something to hide.
[03:26:31.861 --> 03:26:33.461]  Look at how secretive government is.
[03:26:33.881 --> 03:26:40.123]  As it more and more wants to know everything we're doing, and it's caught framing us as well, that's another issue of privacy.
[03:26:40.863 --> 03:26:45.445]  Now, now, they want to be completely secret.
[03:26:45.485 --> 03:26:46.085]  Please continue.
[03:26:47.219 --> 03:26:49.581]  Yeah, well, that's for darn sure, isn't it?
[03:26:50.041 --> 03:26:59.609]  And, you know, this E-Parasites Act that you were talking about, this act that basically says you can shut down a website if there's something on it that somebody says is copyrighted.
[03:26:59.629 --> 03:27:08.196]  You know, I was thinking you can go on my website, katherinealbert.com, or spychips.com, or even nocards.org, my ancient website where we were fighting
[03:27:08.636 --> 03:27:22.725]  Shopper Cards, and on those websites, it occurred to me, under this new e-parasites bill, if it passes, you could have a picture of me in a protest, right, with a big stop RFID sign, standing under a Walmart sign in the snow.
[03:27:23.165 --> 03:27:27.288]  I did that in Amherst, New Hampshire, I've done that in Texas, in Dallas, I've done it all over the country.
[03:27:27.688 --> 03:27:34.172]  But you could take that picture and make the argument that because I've got Walmart's logo up there, in the
[03:27:34.432 --> 03:27:34.832]  We're good.
[03:27:51.237 --> 03:27:52.778]  Well, there's a couple catches here, though.
[03:27:52.798 --> 03:27:55.781]  You can't shut down a website that's based in another country.
[03:27:55.821 --> 03:28:08.191]  So the first thing I would do, or if they did that to InfoWars.com, first thing I would do, of course, is I would say, well, let me get an offshore ISP, or an offshore hosting service, and talk to you over there.
[03:28:09.332 --> 03:28:10.734]  So they're doing a global treaty though.
[03:28:10.754 --> 03:28:12.396]  The Russians and the Chinese do this everywhere.
[03:28:12.416 --> 03:28:17.662]  And again, just like Righthaven, the copyright troll, just had their assets seized by federal marshals.
[03:28:19.184 --> 03:28:24.851]  They claim similar things and were defeated roundly in every court case that we've seen so far that went to court.
[03:28:25.592 --> 03:28:26.954]  But it's a fraud.
[03:28:27.014 --> 03:28:27.714]  It's made up.
[03:28:27.754 --> 03:28:36.503]  The lawyers are attempting to tell people, you've got to have permission to shoot video of a street corner if there's a McDonald's sign.
[03:28:36.543 --> 03:28:41.028]  No, as long as you're under news and information and free speech, you're covered.
[03:28:42.089 --> 03:28:47.050]  So it's a fraud, but they tell you you can't show an image of Walmart that you took.
[03:28:47.370 --> 03:28:48.491]  That's our copyright.
[03:28:49.031 --> 03:28:50.951]  And then there's no judge, no jury, no nothing.
[03:28:50.991 --> 03:28:52.471]  They just take your website down.
[03:28:53.452 --> 03:28:58.073]  It's the incredible arbitrary fraud of this, and it's all just a power grab.
[03:28:58.093 --> 03:29:02.754]  It's like when McDonald's tried to take the name from the McDonald family and said, you can't use this.
[03:29:03.374 --> 03:29:08.457]  On your castle in Scotland, you know, that pays for itself by having a bed and breakfast in it.
[03:29:08.757 --> 03:29:10.478]  You can't call it Macdonald Castle.
[03:29:10.738 --> 03:29:13.359]  And they said, well, this name is 1,600 years old.
[03:29:13.919 --> 03:29:14.580]  And they sued him.
[03:29:14.600 --> 03:29:16.281]  The Macdonalds had to fight him and win.
[03:29:16.621 --> 03:29:18.622]  But it's this attempt to bring in this tyranny.
[03:29:19.704 --> 03:29:21.586]  Yeah, that they own everything.
[03:29:21.626 --> 03:29:35.096]  And of course, the internet, and I'm discovering this after six days of being out of power and off the internet, the internet, I don't think we recognize how much we've come to rely on it and how much we've almost eliminated other means of communication.
[03:29:35.557 --> 03:29:45.565]  And that's when I get a little bit nervous, when I start saying, okay, so we've got this system, it works really well for us advocates to find each other, but if they take it away, we don't have backup systems.
[03:29:45.785 --> 03:29:47.066]  Stay there, let's talk about that.
[03:29:47.106 --> 03:29:49.148]  Long segment coming up with Dr. Kathryn Albright.
[03:29:50.390 --> 03:29:53.373]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.294 --> 03:29:56.976]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.334 --> 03:30:06.338]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[03:30:06.558 --> 03:30:15.686]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey Water Filtration Systems.

[03:31:01.130 --> 03:31:02.291]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:31:02.551 --> 03:31:12.999]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[03:31:13.220 --> 03:31:17.303]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[03:31:17.663 --> 03:31:20.104]  But we can't do that without your help.
[03:31:20.424 --> 03:31:31.287]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:31:31.687 --> 03:31:34.848]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:31:35.188 --> 03:31:40.811]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:31:41.331 --> 03:31:50.817]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[03:31:51.217 --> 03:31:52.397]  The war is here.
[03:31:52.718 --> 03:31:54.138]  It's an info war.
[03:31:54.619 --> 03:31:57.420]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:32:00.922 --> 03:32:05.963]  If the government is busy secretly stockpiling emergency food supplies, shouldn't you be too?
[03:32:06.343 --> 03:32:14.705]  In any emergency food situation, when the local grocery stores and your kitchen cabinets are empty, the first 72 hours are critical to you and your family.
[03:32:15.005 --> 03:32:21.047]  With the 72-hour emergency meal kit from Solutions from Science, you will be prepared for the troubled times ahead.
[03:32:21.407 --> 03:32:30.249]  These flavorful and filling 12 prepackaged meals come in a variety of dishes, have a 25-year shelf life, and simply require water to make them ready to eat.
[03:32:30.569 --> 03:32:34.652]  Are the cans of soup and extra jar of peanut butter going to see you through?
[03:32:34.792 --> 03:32:38.354]  The 72 Hour Emergency Meal Kit is now on sale for $39.97.
[03:32:39.515 --> 03:32:42.117]  A small investment for tremendous peace of mind.

[03:32:47.981 --> 03:32:48.901]  That's 72Survival.com.
[03:32:49.021 --> 03:32:49.482]  Or call 800-208-9491.
[03:32:49.522 --> 03:32:49.862]  That's 800-208-9491.
[03:32:49.982 --> 03:32:52.103]  Why face the next emergency on an empty stomach?
[03:33:14.055 --> 03:33:18.197]  My friends, it is so incredible to see what's happening in our society.
[03:33:19.978 --> 03:33:25.880]  To witness world government being announced, global currencies being pushed as a solution to all the world's problems.
[03:33:26.720 --> 03:33:29.762]  Imminent attack on Iran unless we get the word out and stop this.
[03:33:30.990 --> 03:33:33.232]  Total surveillance.
[03:33:33.392 --> 03:33:37.175]  Lamp posts going up all over the country with microphones and cameras in them.
[03:33:37.655 --> 03:33:39.677]  This was already happening 13 years ago.
[03:33:41.158 --> 03:33:43.260]  It's in my film Police State 2000 I put out in 99.
[03:33:43.820 --> 03:33:46.062]  I have the documents from 1998.
[03:33:46.442 --> 03:33:52.848]  This is a criminal group that has set up a fraud.
[03:33:52.868 --> 03:33:59.153]  The public is living in a false reality and they are setting up a giant DARPA controlled grid
[03:34:00.860 --> 03:34:08.973]  Known as the internet that is meant to absorb society, make it cashless, track everything, and then add fines and fees.
[03:34:08.993 --> 03:34:10.896]  That's another problem with cashless society.
[03:34:11.257 --> 03:34:13.460]  Oh, we'll put a $5 fee on all your transactions.
[03:34:14.454 --> 03:34:16.056]  Now you pay to keep your money with us.
[03:34:16.397 --> 03:34:19.141]  Now companies make you get automatic transfer.
[03:34:19.662 --> 03:34:22.786]  Now you can't use that cash in that second-hand transaction.
[03:34:23.026 --> 03:34:28.254]  Now Homeland Security came out yesterday and said paying with cash is suspicious.
[03:34:28.835 --> 03:34:30.657]  And they told hotels, spy on people.
[03:34:31.738 --> 03:34:35.259]  Dig through your luggage, but nobody dig through the Fed's luggage.
[03:34:35.579 --> 03:34:36.999]  All caught bringing in narcotics.
[03:34:37.399 --> 03:34:43.820]  Catherine, you were getting in, and we're going to go to some calls here, but I want to kind of shut up for 10 minutes or so and give you the floor here.
[03:34:44.381 --> 03:34:53.602]  I want you to run through for people, because you were getting into the fact that it's being set up to where we can't operate without it, and old communication systems are going away.
[03:34:54.223 --> 03:34:57.323]  Like, a lot of people want to continue to have Pirate FM, Micro-FM.
[03:34:57.343 --> 03:35:00.444]  I think it's a great idea, as long as it doesn't interfere with the commercial spectrum.
[03:35:01.553 --> 03:35:07.198]  Now they're handing FM translators to all the big companies to put on mindless stuff like comedy or whatever.
[03:35:07.318 --> 03:35:08.539]  No local programming.
[03:35:08.940 --> 03:35:09.861]  No local interest.
[03:35:10.261 --> 03:35:11.602]  Nothing that serves the community.
[03:35:12.483 --> 03:35:15.206]  And now the FCC's been talking about making it to where...
[03:35:16.775 --> 03:35:24.940]  You can't pick up a reception in your new digital radio with all the cars coming out unless it's got a code authorizing it.
[03:35:25.180 --> 03:35:32.685]  So even if you put up, like they used against the Soviets, a pirate FM and say Romania, it won't even be picked up by the phone.
[03:35:33.105 --> 03:35:35.147]  Just like they can blacklist InfoWars.com.
[03:35:36.007 --> 03:35:36.968]  Or alternative media.
[03:35:37.068 --> 03:35:41.872]  People need to realize we're entering a time where you're not just going to be able to tune in to all this.
[03:35:42.272 --> 03:35:43.754]  People need to appreciate it.
[03:35:44.034 --> 03:35:45.715]  They need to understand how important it is.
[03:35:45.975 --> 03:35:56.064]  They need to tell everybody now about InfoWars.com, about the 27-hour transmission and the free video streams that are up there right now to create a viral spread of this information.
[03:35:56.384 --> 03:35:58.966]  They donated InfoWars money bombs so we can
[03:35:59.887 --> 03:36:14.936]  I told people to sign up at the Infowars Insider because we've been told by our experts that email is something that even if they shut us all down with that list, I could still write articles or with compression do short audios or videos and encode that and send that out to people.
[03:36:15.396 --> 03:36:17.678]  So we need people to sign up there for that free newsletter.
[03:36:17.938 --> 03:36:24.742]  I mean, we really are mounting an assault against the globalists who've created this artificial habitat for us that they're now phasing us into.
[03:36:24.762 --> 03:36:26.203]  So Catherine, you've got the floor.
[03:36:27.122 --> 03:36:37.276]  I want you to break down what you were getting into, the threats you see, other facets, other areas, the whole Futurist system, what's driving this, what the master plan is, then we'll go to calls.
[03:36:38.274 --> 03:36:41.055]  Well, and that's what I want to get into with some of the solutions.
[03:36:41.075 --> 03:36:45.597]  You're talking about, you know, sending out encrypted email, getting people onto InfoWars.
[03:36:45.737 --> 03:36:48.018]  These are all things that people should be doing.
[03:36:48.699 --> 03:36:52.040]  And, you know, I'll send anybody who'll ask me, hey, where do I get the information?
[03:36:52.100 --> 03:36:54.001]  I'll say, you know, InfoWars.com.
[03:36:54.041 --> 03:36:55.321]  I've got my websites up.
[03:36:55.342 --> 03:36:57.703]  You know, there's a lot of places out there where people can go.
[03:36:58.243 --> 03:37:02.144]  You do an extraordinary job of being a clearinghouse for a lot of that.
[03:37:02.625 --> 03:37:05.066]  But let me also tell you, in terms of encryption,
[03:37:06.226 --> 03:37:21.029]  And when we start talking solutions, what drives me crazy is when people on our team, people who ought to know better, are sending those emails through Gmail, for example, or signing up for Google Voicemail, for example, because Google is reading all those emails.
[03:37:21.389 --> 03:37:30.811]  And if they're using Google as their search engine, and I've told your listeners many times before, StartPage.com is the company that I recommend as an alternative to Google.
[03:37:31.411 --> 03:37:35.595]  Yeah, because Google is reading all of the searches that you do.
[03:37:35.675 --> 03:37:50.927]  So if you go in there and you search for global control grid, or you search for offshore tax havens, or you search for smart meter opposition, whatever it is you're putting in there, the fact that you typed it in, Google is using and they are creating these incredible
[03:37:51.007 --> 03:37:51.788]  We're good to go.
[03:38:10.441 --> 03:38:14.463]  Because that's where you go if you want to figure out, you know, ask your question.
[03:38:14.503 --> 03:38:21.565]  Hey, give me a recipe for cinnamon toast or tell me what's the latest on the power outage or whatever it might be.
[03:38:21.626 --> 03:38:23.466]  People log on to Google unthinkingly.
[03:38:23.986 --> 03:38:26.828]  So there are some tools out there that people can use.
[03:38:27.188 --> 03:38:29.709]  One of them is SSL encryption.
[03:38:29.829 --> 03:38:35.411]  And the reason this is important, and I'm going to take a minute and I usually don't like to get too technical on people, so I'll explain this.
[03:38:36.151 --> 03:38:39.553]  SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer Encryption.
[03:38:40.233 --> 03:38:40.413]  I don't
[03:38:56.688 --> 03:39:13.552]  Or you log onto a website, you are essentially sending a postcard to your internet service provider, that's your charter, your AT&T, your Verizon, whoever's giving you your net connection, is monitoring where you go, they're monitoring what you send, they have the capability of reading your email.
[03:39:14.153 --> 03:39:19.814]  If you are sending from or to a Gmail account, a Yahoo account, or a Hotmail account,
[03:39:20.034 --> 03:39:20.314]  We're good.
[03:39:38.812 --> 03:39:39.153]  No, we're good.
[03:39:54.352 --> 03:40:02.334]  Startpage is working on an email program that will be totally private, totally encrypted, and will incorporate PGP.
[03:40:02.374 --> 03:40:03.854]  It's going to be called Startmail.
[03:40:04.374 --> 03:40:05.895]  It's coming out probably the end of 2012.
[03:40:07.135 --> 03:40:14.757]  But in the meantime, Startpage, and if people don't know what that is, Alex, you know, it's the private search engine that people need to be using instead of Google.
[03:40:15.297 --> 03:40:15.897]  We're good to go.
[03:40:31.123 --> 03:40:37.147]  Just made an announcement this week that they have switched over to complete SSL encryption.
[03:40:37.828 --> 03:40:48.615]  And now what that means is that when you log on to start page and you make a search, so let's say you look up offshore tax havens, or you look up InfoWars, or you know the latest story that we've got out there.
[03:40:49.355 --> 03:40:50.596]  I don't know maybe those
[03:40:51.196 --> 03:40:51.977]  Electric lights.
[03:40:53.078 --> 03:40:54.839]  The street lights that can listen to you.
[03:40:55.340 --> 03:40:57.962]  So when you search for that in Google, they know it.
[03:40:58.102 --> 03:41:00.584]  Or you look for Juan Paul, they know who all the supporters are.
[03:41:00.984 --> 03:41:13.875]  But if you go to Startpage and you search for that, what is new is now not only does Startpage not record you, it's Startpage.com, but your ISP can't see what you're doing with Startpage.
[03:41:14.215 --> 03:41:17.478]  So your ISP no longer can record your searches.
[03:41:18.118 --> 03:41:30.146]  Now, the thing that has people a little confused, though, is if you click on a link, so let's say you go on, it's just like Google, by the way, and in fact, Start Page Now returns 100% Google results totally privately.
[03:41:30.727 --> 03:41:36.771]  So we go to Google, we grab Google's results, we strip everything away from them, and then we re-serve them to you.
[03:41:37.331 --> 03:41:41.594]  So when you go there, if you click on a link, now you're leaving the SSL encryption.
[03:41:41.634 --> 03:41:43.455]  You lose that encrypted protection.
[03:41:43.935 --> 03:41:47.398]  Unless you do one thing, and we're the only search engine that offers this,
[03:41:47.998 --> 03:41:49.699]  Click the word proxy.
[03:41:49.719 --> 03:41:55.402]  There's actually a little link under your search results for the outside third-party website.
[03:41:55.802 --> 03:41:58.123]  It'll say view through Ixquik proxy.
[03:41:58.643 --> 03:42:02.145]  Now if you click that, so let's say you want to go to a government website.
[03:42:02.525 --> 03:42:10.169]  You know I tried to go to just the National Weather Service website and I have a whole bunch of things on my computer that alert me when they're doing stuff.
[03:42:10.909 --> 03:42:17.652]  And I had something saying, they're running a script on this page, they're loading cookies into my browser.
[03:42:17.712 --> 03:42:19.173]  I was like, get me out of here!
[03:42:19.653 --> 03:42:24.796]  So I went to StartPage.com, I punched in National Weather Service... And you were able to get there?
[03:42:24.816 --> 03:42:27.237]  Go ahead and finish up.
[03:42:28.393 --> 03:42:35.615]  Well, what they do is Startpage gets the National Weather Service, loads it for me, and the National Weather Service never sees me.
[03:42:35.715 --> 03:42:45.417]  Can't put a cookie on my browser, can't run a script, doesn't even know that I was there, and my ISP doesn't know I went to the National Weather Service because everything is now encrypted.
[03:42:45.917 --> 03:42:50.978]  So, it's pretty much the most private way you can surf the Internet, and I'm excited.
[03:42:51.299 --> 03:42:52.579]  It certainly is.
[03:42:52.619 --> 03:42:56.740]  Now, going back here, though, we all know that authoritarian regimes
[03:42:57.944 --> 03:42:58.885]  Go through your mail.
[03:42:59.905 --> 03:43:04.128]  And people would get mad if the post office was going through their mail, which they now do.
[03:43:04.988 --> 03:43:11.612]  But if it's digital mail, oh, we're just gonna have an AI computer read that, scan that, put it in your algorithm.
[03:43:12.133 --> 03:43:13.754]  And these companies are all on record.
[03:43:15.003 --> 03:43:22.564]  Doing this, and then you learn they have a partnership with the government because you, when you sign up the terms, don't understand you're waiving your rights.
[03:43:22.584 --> 03:43:24.085]  Now that's given to the government.
[03:43:24.765 --> 03:43:31.126]  And now we see the big megacorporations basically trying to get government to just fully sign government power over to them.
[03:43:31.226 --> 03:43:32.786]  It is completely predatory.
[03:43:33.206 --> 03:43:37.087]  I want to go to some phone calls, but Catherine, I know you've been tracking this.
[03:43:37.647 --> 03:43:42.688]  Is it even kind of still amazing you to actually see it happening where there's all these calls now?
[03:43:44.096 --> 03:43:46.538]  To start censoring the alternative media?
[03:43:46.558 --> 03:44:07.979]  I mean, I see that as a real coming of age for the alternative media, becoming the true dominant media, but it's also scary the perfect storm of government, major corporations, and media that are all on the hot seat, getting together now, spinning the end of the internet as we know it, as members of Congress that have read this bill have said.
[03:44:09.565 --> 03:44:21.177]  The Internet is the biggest threat that they have ever faced, because for the first time in all of history, in the history of humanity, millions of people can communicate with one another instantaneously.
[03:44:21.657 --> 03:44:23.179]  And the government hates that.
[03:44:23.219 --> 03:44:29.706]  Now, they're more than happy if you want to communicate and say, oh, how much you really love their, you know, President Obama's latest bill.
[03:44:30.106 --> 03:44:36.628]  But if you're going to get on there and talk about how much you know what's really going on, then they ought to put an end to that.
[03:44:36.728 --> 03:44:46.611]  So they are coming up with, you know, whether it's terrorism or shutting down on financial crimes, they're going to come up with a reason, they're going to have an excuse, and they're going to find ways, first of all, to monitor.
[03:44:46.651 --> 03:44:48.451]  This is what I was saying at the beginning of the show.
[03:44:48.932 --> 03:44:49.772]  You monitor first.
[03:44:50.692 --> 03:44:52.433]  And then you start clamping down.
[03:44:52.453 --> 03:44:54.835]  And that is why, again, I'm just going to repeat it.
[03:44:54.895 --> 03:44:59.018]  People need to find ways to use the Internet and get out of the monitoring.
[03:44:59.538 --> 03:45:03.461]  Anybody writing... I'm to the point where I almost won't even answer a Gmail.
[03:45:03.841 --> 03:45:12.407]  If you write to me from a Gmail account, I don't want to write you back because I know that everything I say to you, I may as well be saying into a megaphone to Google.
[03:45:14.008 --> 03:45:15.049]  Let me expand on that.
[03:45:15.569 --> 03:45:22.654]  We have people that sign up for our emails, but if they're with Gmail or others, Gmail will complain and call our mail spam.
[03:45:23.094 --> 03:45:25.736]  So, I mean, they're just total Nazis.
[03:45:26.236 --> 03:45:27.357]  They're out of control.
[03:45:27.377 --> 03:45:35.562]  And I agree we should try to do alternative systems and develop those systems outside of Big Brother's purview, but we should politically and legally
[03:45:35.922 --> 03:45:39.967]  Try to challenge the entire unconstitutional action on its face as well.
[03:45:40.307 --> 03:45:44.872]  Catherine, I want to get an update on your health, because everybody's obviously praying for you and concerned about you here in a moment.
[03:45:44.892 --> 03:45:51.459]  But let's start getting the calls now, because I think we've got to leave at the end of the hour, because we're going to leave the Genesis Network at that point, and that's how you're connected to us.
[03:45:52.040 --> 03:45:59.183]  And then we are going to transfer over to the rest of the 27-hour plus live transmission with George Norrie, David Icke, and many others coming up today.
[03:45:59.203 --> 03:46:02.185]  If you want to donate, it's infowarsmoneybomb.com.
[03:46:02.205 --> 03:46:06.027]  You can also call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[03:46:06.167 --> 03:46:14.451]  And we have deals going where you can get, what is this, all 14 of my films that are on DVD for
[03:46:17.097 --> 03:46:18.518]  $99.95 instead of $349.
[03:46:19.139 --> 03:46:21.680]  That's the Alex Jones Everything Special.
[03:46:21.700 --> 03:46:23.081]  We never offered it at that price.
[03:46:23.101 --> 03:46:28.184]  It's a Money Bomb special, so you get great tools to wake yourself up more and those around you and support us.
[03:46:28.845 --> 03:46:35.069]  Also, you've got the Alex Jones Classic DVD Special, and that is five films for $29.95.
[03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:39.792]  It's actually six films because one of them has two films on it.
[03:46:40.592 --> 03:46:44.695]  Then we've got also the Patriot Flags.
[03:46:45.755 --> 03:46:48.817]  We've got all of those to help spread the word with your neighbors and others.
[03:46:48.837 --> 03:46:55.320]  We have the essential Alex Jones, my five best-selling films for $24.95, all available at Infowars.com.
[03:46:55.680 --> 03:47:01.923]  We've now cut the bumper stickers down to absolute cost, normally $25 for the variety pack.
[03:47:01.963 --> 03:47:06.145]  Now $5.95, certainly get the word out against the globalists with that.
[03:47:06.525 --> 03:47:08.186]  We are pulling out all the stops.
[03:47:08.226 --> 03:47:11.567]  For $19.95, you can get my four films on 9-11, the 9-11 documentary special.
[03:47:13.348 --> 03:47:14.550]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:47:14.971 --> 03:47:16.173]  We'll take a lot more as the 27 hours.
[03:47:17.898 --> 03:47:26.704]  continues a lot of folks would just Let the guests talk and as I've been doing a little bit today and not and mainly take calls But we've got so much info.
[03:47:27.485 --> 03:47:42.396]  I tend to not be like most talk show hosts that just rely on calls It probably would be better though to take more calls because I always hear the calls and rebroadcast and wish I took more So we'll do that for the rest of this hour and the entire next hour and then more coming up We've also got some other surprises coming up.
[03:47:42.416 --> 03:47:43.036]  So stay with us.
[03:47:43.617 --> 03:47:44.137]  Let's talk to
[03:47:45.678 --> 03:47:48.259]  Mike in Wisconsin, you're on the air with Dr. Kathryn Albrecht.
[03:47:48.279 --> 03:47:48.639]  Go ahead.
[03:47:48.659 --> 03:47:51.100]  Hello, Kathryn.
[03:47:51.120 --> 03:47:51.941]  It's a pleasure.
[03:47:52.221 --> 03:47:53.121]  Alex, you're the man.
[03:47:53.161 --> 03:47:53.601]  What's up?
[03:47:54.622 --> 03:47:55.642]  I'm doing well, sir.
[03:47:55.902 --> 03:47:56.802]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:47:56.882 --> 03:48:01.284]  Are you watching us on the free video streams at InfoWars.com or are you listening?
[03:48:01.384 --> 03:48:02.085]  Yes, I am.
[03:48:03.265 --> 03:48:10.628]  I'm watching online right now and also I'm glad you guys are talking about online communication because
[03:48:11.235 --> 03:48:17.649]  I'm in my mid-twenties and I've learned there's lots of other ways to communicate online.
[03:48:17.709 --> 03:48:21.057]  I don't know if Catherine's ever heard of Internet Relay Chat?
[03:48:22.285 --> 03:48:23.506]  Oh yeah, you know, it's funny.
[03:48:24.087 --> 03:48:27.929]  IRC was my big addiction back in graduate school.
[03:48:27.949 --> 03:48:29.471]  So yeah, I'm a huge fan of IRC.
[03:48:29.571 --> 03:48:31.352]  Internet relay chat, absolutely.
[03:48:31.452 --> 03:48:36.135]  Are you talking about like VBS systems and then you've got all... Exactly.
[03:48:36.456 --> 03:48:41.199]  And the nice thing about it, you can actually set them up from computer to computer.
[03:48:41.299 --> 03:48:46.163]  So if you've got the skills or have a friend with the skills, you can actually set up a
[03:48:46.783 --> 03:48:47.124]  Thank you.
[03:49:03.089 --> 03:49:12.274]  I'm glad that you're aware of it because, you know, there are a lot of us out there that still know how to use programs like that and, you know, we'll try to keep it alive and keep the word out for things like that.
[03:49:12.754 --> 03:49:20.459]  But real quick, Alex... Yeah, and, you know, keep developing the new systems because what we need to be doing, and this is what I love about Startpage,
[03:49:20.919 --> 03:49:32.128]  You know, when they passed this thing that said, hey, we want to start, all of the ISPs have to log all the traffic that people do, all the websites you go to, we were like, whoa, time out!
[03:49:32.608 --> 03:49:45.658]  How can we technologically, in this era where we've got so many skills, you know, we've got great technology on our team, on the Freedom Team, and so the team there at StarPage, we got together and said, alright, so how do we get around it?
[03:49:46.118 --> 03:49:47.920]  And so that's how we came up with the proxy.
[03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:50.023]  We said, yeah, log away ISPs.
[03:49:50.083 --> 03:49:50.703]  Be my guest.
[03:49:50.764 --> 03:49:54.928]  You record every place I go because you won't be able to see a darn thing.
[03:49:54.948 --> 03:49:58.412]  I can go to a hundred websites in a day and you won't know.
[03:49:58.473 --> 03:50:01.196]  Well, here's a San Francisco Chronicle article today.
[03:50:01.616 --> 03:50:04.498]  Smart meters send almost 10,000 signals a day.
[03:50:04.518 --> 03:50:11.243]  I mean, yeah, instead of a guy coming by once a week to find out what you used, oh, we're Greeks bearing gifts, Troy.
[03:50:11.543 --> 03:50:19.809]  Take our Trojan horse, and then it's tagged onto your bill to pay for something, spying on what you watch on TV, and you tell somebody this.
[03:50:20.110 --> 03:50:22.131]  I tell people this stuff 10 years ago, they laugh at me.
[03:50:22.471 --> 03:50:23.492]  Now it's in their face.
[03:50:23.592 --> 03:50:26.334]  I mean, this is such an out-of-control system.
[03:50:26.354 --> 03:50:27.095]  Sir, you had a question?
[03:50:29.079 --> 03:50:34.121]  I actually run We Are Change Milwaukee, and I know this is a little off topic, but I'm going to be quick.
[03:50:34.921 --> 03:50:42.423]  The General Assembly in Milwaukee, I offered to debate some of the leaders on camera, in the public eye.
[03:50:44.204 --> 03:50:59.089]  They denied me, and I started to investigate deeper into the leadership of the Occupy Milwaukee movement, and I found out that one of the leaders is actually part of the Freedom Road Socialist Organization.
[03:50:59.249 --> 03:51:00.670]  No, no, almost, listen, listen.
[03:51:00.910 --> 03:51:11.114]  The socialists know they're not popular, so they call for a demonstration against Wall Street corruption that's actually funding socialism, and then the well-meaning people show up,
[03:51:12.048 --> 03:51:14.790]  And then the socialists come and don't say who they are and try to co-opt it.
[03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:16.511]  But they've pretty much failed.
[03:51:16.871 --> 03:51:18.673]  That's why they're now going to billy club them.
[03:51:19.533 --> 03:51:23.236]  It may be, actually, maybe we'll have sympathy for them to get some more come out.
[03:51:23.256 --> 03:51:23.836]  I'm not sure.
[03:51:23.896 --> 03:51:27.379]  But, Catherine, what's your view on the whole Occupy Wall Street situation?
[03:51:28.561 --> 03:51:31.003]  Well, you know, they're not our team, that's for sure.
[03:51:31.023 --> 03:51:33.064]  The people out there.
[03:51:33.544 --> 03:51:43.971]  And, you know, the more they call for socialism, the more the big corporations are going to say, oh, please don't throw me in the briar patch, anything but the government takeover of our business.
[03:51:44.051 --> 03:51:58.441]  They'd love nothing more for the government and the corporations to become one, because then it'll be them against us, and they're going to be like the 800-pound gorilla on their end of the teeter-totter, and we'll just be the little tiny, you know, five-pound public.
[03:51:58.901 --> 03:52:16.028]  So they would love, you know, George Soros, it's been said, is behind a lot of this stuff because they would totally love total fascism where the government takes over all the banks, creates a big world bank, takes over all the businesses, all the petroleum companies, creates one big global system.
[03:52:16.348 --> 03:52:23.651]  The fat cats will eat at the trough and we little guys will have zero power because they'll control everything, all consolidated.
[03:52:24.051 --> 03:52:29.232]  Well, Jesse Ventura was on yesterday, and he's like, I think Occupy Wall Street's good, at least the folks he's talked to, and I've run into a lot of them.
[03:52:29.552 --> 03:52:32.053]  You know, they're tired of Wall Street taking over Washington.
[03:52:32.413 --> 03:52:38.875]  Well, it's actually certain elements, the megabanks, the globalists that have taken it over, who've gotten the tens of trillions.
[03:52:39.175 --> 03:52:44.456]  It's not more money that's needed in taxes, it's that we need our money back that's gone offshore.
[03:52:44.476 --> 03:52:48.717]  You know, the big banks won't loan our own money we gave them, and then we pay them back
[03:52:49.688 --> 03:52:51.610]  Interest on the bailout we gave them.
[03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:53.852]  I mean that's the message you've got to get it.
[03:52:53.952 --> 03:53:11.810]  I've tried to go to Occupy Wall Street Rob Jacobson has so many others and their leaders come over and they say listen you get out of here with that Okay, we want socialism now the crowds themselves are good people and they always say there's no leader here But it turns out time and time again It is the Democratic Party.
[03:53:11.850 --> 03:53:12.331]  Sorry go ahead
[03:53:13.376 --> 03:53:22.459]  Well, I gotta say, you know, I'm all for the crowds out there, because they're doing the right thing, they're standing up, and they're trying to get up, and trying to say enough is enough, we're sick of it.
[03:53:22.919 --> 03:53:26.920]  What is disgusting to me is what always happens.
[03:53:26.940 --> 03:53:28.221]  We saw it over in Egypt, too.
[03:53:28.261 --> 03:53:39.064]  You have the public rise up and say no, and then crafty powers that be are working behind the scenes to figure out how to take that momentum and turn it into something ugly.
[03:53:39.464 --> 03:53:42.365]  So I would say to all the Occupy folks, you guys rock!
[03:53:42.825 --> 03:53:50.287]  But be very careful who you're listening to, because if you're listening to people who say the government has to take over the corporations, you're hearing the wrong message.
[03:53:50.787 --> 03:53:52.207]  That's not going to be the solution.
[03:53:52.247 --> 03:53:58.809]  That's going to leave you even more powerless when those two forces consolidate and then together work against you.
[03:53:58.829 --> 03:54:00.089]  We're really going to be in trouble.
[03:54:00.109 --> 03:54:00.509]  You're right.
[03:54:00.529 --> 03:54:01.690]  Let's go quickly to calls.
[03:54:02.370 --> 03:54:04.330]  Ivan in Florida.
[03:54:04.370 --> 03:54:04.750]  Welcome.
[03:54:05.811 --> 03:54:06.631]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:54:06.891 --> 03:54:07.311]  Good, brother.
[03:54:08.587 --> 03:54:17.651]  Uh, I wanted to take a minute because you have, uh, Captain Albright on the show, and let's do the next part, and, uh, RFID technology and things of that nature.
[03:54:18.491 --> 03:54:18.751]  Right.
[03:54:20.292 --> 03:54:21.272]  Yeah, I noticed... Go ahead.
[03:54:21.813 --> 03:54:29.416]  You know, in the toll roads, how you have the, uh, scanners that, that read the... You can buy a SunPass, things of that... Yeah.
[03:54:29.436 --> 03:54:31.197]  ...and you don't have to pay the tolls?
[03:54:31.217 --> 03:54:32.577]  Well, I've noticed... Right.
[03:54:32.777 --> 03:54:37.059]  ...in, uh, in Orlando here, they've, they've been putting those on public roads.
[03:54:37.984 --> 03:54:43.368]  I was wondering if that's just like a local phenomenon, or have you noticed that?
[03:54:43.428 --> 03:54:44.529]  No, it's nationwide.
[03:54:44.549 --> 03:54:50.213]  No, but let me tell you, you SunPass people were the guinea pigs, in fact.
[03:54:50.313 --> 03:55:00.000]  You guys were the very first, the SunPass down in Florida, was the first state that had those toll transponders used to experiment with traffic surveillance.
[03:55:00.440 --> 03:55:02.322]  And so what's happening now is anybody
[03:55:02.862 --> 03:55:11.930]  Stupid enough and lazy enough to have a toll transponder on their windshield instead of stopping and paying cash like all good Americans who value their freedom ought to do.
[03:55:11.950 --> 03:55:17.635]  You guys are the vanguard of total automobile tracking and it's happening right now.
[03:55:17.675 --> 03:55:20.498]  They can put a reader for that anywhere in the country.
[03:55:20.518 --> 03:55:25.542]  They're putting them in gantries, that's the overpasses on the freeway, miles from the toll roads.
[03:55:25.882 --> 03:55:29.746]  I saw an article, Catherine, ten years ago where San Francisco was doing it.
[03:55:30.794 --> 03:55:31.174]  That's right.
[03:55:31.454 --> 03:55:32.155]  They're doing it.
[03:55:32.455 --> 03:55:34.617]  And, you know, you want to speak about RFID.
[03:55:34.657 --> 03:55:37.799]  The other thing you don't want to do, please don't get a toll transponder.
[03:55:37.859 --> 03:55:39.300]  If you have one, get rid of it.
[03:55:39.861 --> 03:55:41.902]  My husband and I call it the privacy tax.
[03:55:41.942 --> 03:55:43.544]  We spend a little longer in line.
[03:55:43.904 --> 03:55:48.287]  We have to actually carry cash with us, but that's what protects your privacy.
[03:55:48.647 --> 03:55:55.873]  The other thing you don't want to get, and if you have one, tear it up, is an enhanced driver's license to get into Canada or Mexico.
[03:55:55.913 --> 03:55:56.873]  It's got an RFID.
[03:55:57.194 --> 03:55:59.716]  Same thing with the passport, but expanding on that, Catherine.
[03:56:00.436 --> 03:56:05.617]  It's not only that, we've got to keep using cash as much as we can, or they're going to totally phase it out.
[03:56:06.678 --> 03:56:07.978]  Amen, amen.
[03:56:08.098 --> 03:56:11.659]  So, you know, start doing your grocery shopping with cash, folks.
[03:56:11.799 --> 03:56:13.960]  Start doing everything you do with cash.
[03:56:14.300 --> 03:56:16.800]  You know, they always say use it or lose it with your muscles.
[03:56:16.940 --> 03:56:19.701]  Use it or lose it with your privacy, and especially with your cash.
[03:56:20.241 --> 03:56:26.323]  One thing I want to say, though, the passports, the booklet passports, have a re-range of about two inches.
[03:56:27.303 --> 03:56:33.467]  Um, the enhanced driver's licenses, though, have a re-range of 35 feet.
[03:56:33.927 --> 03:56:49.076]  They're not encrypted, and in fact, every Walmart that is using RFID to read the underwear shelf, not making this up, the actual underwear, can read your enhanced driver's license right through your purse or pocket as you stand there in front of the underwear.
[03:56:49.496 --> 03:56:54.919]  No exaggeration, absolutely 100%- And by the way, the globalists- Walmart can't even prevent it.
[03:56:55.478 --> 03:56:57.999]  The globalists are super ultra bold.
[03:56:58.760 --> 03:57:02.481]  And they know that with all this RFID, it's going to cause a rash of identity theft.
[03:57:02.901 --> 03:57:06.823]  Their answer will then be RFID with a biometric print.
[03:57:07.864 --> 03:57:10.225]  That's how they're going to force this in.
[03:57:10.245 --> 03:57:13.746]  I appreciate your call there from Florida.
[03:57:14.207 --> 03:57:14.927]  Good to hear from you.
[03:57:15.267 --> 03:57:16.648]  Catherine, how's your health?
[03:57:17.915 --> 03:57:19.076]  Well, you know, I'm doing good.
[03:57:19.116 --> 03:57:21.057]  I've got a new blog to let people know.
[03:57:21.097 --> 03:57:30.464]  My regular website is katherinealbrecht.com, where all my radio archives are, but I just started a blog at wordpress.katherinealbrecht.com.
[03:57:30.524 --> 03:57:33.106]  Love to hear from people, but I'm posting updates on my health.
[03:57:33.786 --> 03:57:42.112]  I am almost done with chemotherapy, starting radiation therapy, feeling actually really strong and really fantastic, so I think I'm going to beat this thing.
[03:57:43.342 --> 03:57:46.067]  Well, praise God for that and the prayers certainly won't hurt.
[03:57:46.969 --> 03:57:53.322]  Catherine, I really appreciate you spending time with us here on the fourth annual InfoWars Money Bomb.
[03:57:53.782 --> 03:57:55.225]  I look forward to speaking to you in the future.
[03:57:56.414 --> 03:57:58.535]  Hey, congrats with that 27-hour thing.
[03:57:59.195 --> 03:57:59.876]  You go, Alex.
[03:58:00.056 --> 03:58:00.956]  Hey, I just ate something.
[03:58:00.976 --> 03:58:01.836]  I'm feeling good now.
[03:58:03.317 --> 03:58:04.137]  Thank you, Catherine.
[03:58:04.698 --> 03:58:08.019]  All right, now we've got a bunch of other guests coming up, but this hour is going to be wide open.
[03:58:08.579 --> 03:58:19.824]  Michael, Tommy, and Patrick, and Jared, they need to be given off-air, John, the call-in number at our studio so I can go to them first before I give out the general number for everybody else.
[03:58:20.285 --> 03:58:20.945]  I'm going to come back.
[03:58:21.405 --> 03:58:25.427]  Into the fifth hour of the 27-hour transmission on the other side.
[03:58:25.467 --> 03:58:27.408]  It won't be on Genesis or the satellite.
[03:58:27.728 --> 03:58:34.371]  You've got to go to InfoWars.com to find the free audio and video streams right now.
[03:58:35.572 --> 03:58:37.693]  20 plus hours more coming up.
[03:58:38.133 --> 03:58:39.533]  22 hours straight ahead.
[03:58:39.553 --> 03:58:45.156]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.176 --> 03:58:47.097]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:52.529 --> 03:58:56.811]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[03:58:57.232 --> 03:59:03.095]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[03:59:03.655 --> 03:59:05.416]  Number one, study the past.
[03:59:05.936 --> 03:59:07.697]  History really does repeat itself.
[03:59:08.318 --> 03:59:12.060]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[03:59:35.695 --> 03:59:38.698]  You can run on for a long time.
[03:59:38.718 --> 03:59:41.620]  Run on for a long time.
[03:59:42.281 --> 03:59:44.422]  Run on for a long time.
[03:59:45.123 --> 03:59:47.545]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:59:48.105 --> 03:59:50.527]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[03:59:52.734 --> 04:00:07.365]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
