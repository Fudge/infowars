[00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.987]  My friends, Alex Jones here with key breaking news.
[00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:09.670]  It is April 18th, 2011.
[00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:23.480]  I told you more than two months ago, when this whole Libya situation kicked off, that NATO and the UN were planning to get us involved in another war and were preparing ground troops to invade Libya.
[00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:35.983]  When the UN passed their resolution, within 36 hours, President Obama had followed their orders, not consulted Congress, and launched a war, an air war against Libya.
[00:00:36.283 --> 00:00:49.165]  And when the public pointed out that you've got to get congressional approval under the Constitution to do that, or we might as well just have a Caesar or a Fuhrer, Obama's people came out and said, it's kinetic action, it's not a war.
[00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.766]  Now, even before this conflict started,
[00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:53.199]  U.S.
[00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:10.363]  and British-backed forces, SAS and others, CIA commandos, were on the ground in eastern Libya working with the admitted al-Qaeda-affiliated groups against Qaddafi, who tried to make deals, and did make deals, six years ago to give up his WMDs and make nice with the West.
[00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.043]  But none of that even matters.
[00:01:12.063 --> 00:01:14.104]  Let's say you love Qaddafi, hate Qaddafi.
[00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:19.945]  The issue is the system thinks we're so dumb that they launched this new war.
[00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:33.370]  and had the nerve to tell us that it wasn't a war and promised and swore there would never be a ground invasion when you read the UN resolution it talks about whatever force is necessary and they've been massing
[00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:36.849]  Troop ships with British and U.S.
[00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:40.250]  Marines off the coast going back into even early March.
[00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.313]  On March 2nd, more ships launched from the United States with Marines on board saying they're ready for ground operations in Libya.
[00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:52.495]  And this is what's so sick about this new level of deception and how dumb the system thinks we are.
[00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:59.538]  They're saying it's a humanitarian force of a thousand that's going to land and help the rebels in a humanitarian way
[00:01:59.998 --> 00:02:01.540]  Open up roads and the seaways.
[00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:14.737]  And if the Libyan government gets in their way in any way, then they'll have to be a larger ground force because that evil Qaddafi dare attack the globalist military that was there helping the rebels attack them.
[00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:28.720]  They think the public is so stupid that if Libya fights back against bombardment from the air or ground troops, giving munitions and logistics to the Al Qaeda forces attacking Gaddafi, that that is some form of terrorism.
[00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:38.088]  This is the new model of imperial world government, where the UN, owned by the big central banks, launches rebel forces inside
[00:02:39.227 --> 00:02:39.568]  Egypt.
[00:02:39.908 --> 00:02:45.234]  When Egypt stands up against them, the West comes in and backs the overthrow of Mubarak, their old dictator.
[00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:49.058]  Same thing is being done in other Middle Eastern and North African countries.
[00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:51.520]  And the world realizes what's happening.
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.829]  That's why Saudi Arabia is running away in fear to Russia and China now and slashing oil production because they understand the West has turned on them.
[00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.670]  I'm not a fan of the corrupt Saudis either.
[00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.572]  The point is, why are the globalists destabilizing the world now?
[00:03:05.992 --> 00:03:20.861]  And why do the globalists think we are so stupid that Obama and the UN and the rest of them swore there'd never be ground forces when they already had SAS commandos and CIA advisors on the ground from before the conflict?
[00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.419]  This is amazing.
[00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:34.623]  So the ground force is getting ready, and now with Orwellian-type terms, they're telling us that this itself isn't a ground invasion, just like the air bombardment was not an air war.
[00:03:35.123 --> 00:03:38.064]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's breaking at Infowars.com.
[00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:40.164]  The London Guardian's also reporting on it.
[00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:49.227]  The EU is moving ahead with their invasion under UN authority, and all of this to legitimize the world government.
[00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:52.347]  This is how the imperial system invades countries.
[00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:58.874]  They have their rebels attack, and if their rebels aren't successful in taking over the nation, then the air power and the ground troops are brought in.
[00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:00.395]  This is incredible.
[00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:12.468]  And you've all been lied to arrogantly the whole time they knew that they were going to have this ground invasion, and swore they'd never do it, treating us all like a bunch of idiots and trying to break our will and condition us
[00:04:12.788 --> 00:04:16.311]  to accept the fact that Western governments are a pack of liars.
[00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:19.193]  And they don't just want to enslave the Libyans or the Egyptians.
[00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:25.618]  Since they put in a new government in Egypt, they've banned protest entirely and have the modesty police out in force.
[00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:28.580]  They want to take our liberties here at home as well.
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.284]  This is a global, corporate government that wages war against any form of human liberty.
[00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:45.394]  And if we don't speak out against this new war, they're going to launch more and more and more, just like the French have now invaded the Ivory Coast and overthrown the government and brought in the rebels that were hacking people up with machetes.
[00:04:46.314 --> 00:04:50.578]  If we don't say no to this system, the globalists are not going to stop.
[00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:54.801]  They are launching a takeover all over the planet, and it's very dangerous.
[00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:59.245]  And it marks a major escalation in the neo-imperial takeover of the planet.
[00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:07.802]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.445]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:12.948]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoots Direct.
[00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:17.333]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:19.015]  You must act automatically.
[00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.418]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:05:22.758 --> 00:05:25.220]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.486]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:36.649]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:46.579]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.661]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:51.184]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:05.775]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:06.135 --> 00:06:09.777]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:09.997 --> 00:06:12.258]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:17.740]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.402]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:30.365]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:30.805 --> 00:06:34.467]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:38.989]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.772]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:48.194]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:50.195]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:50.736 --> 00:06:51.176]  It's here.

[00:07:58.978 --> 00:07:59.399]  Thank you.
[00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:03.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.841]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.257 --> 00:08:22.824]  Well, we have a completely jam-packed and vitally important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:28.389]  As I said yesterday at the beginning of the broadcast, no, it's not your imagination.
[00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:31.232]  The news is quickening.
[00:08:31.753 --> 00:08:40.101]  Events are intensifying and accelerating at every level, economically, societally, culturally.
[00:08:41.013 --> 00:08:43.514]  And we're going to break it down today.
[00:08:43.954 --> 00:09:00.782]  The social engineers of the planet who are eugenicists in their own stated goals for world hegemony to then carry out forced population reduction are attempting to take control of the planet through fiat issuance of currency and credit.
[00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:10.869]  That they create out of nothing and pay politicians and political classes off to accept and back up with military and police force.
[00:09:11.369 --> 00:09:19.916]  With this unlimited capital, their stated goal in every third world nation in Europe and here in the United States has always been, i.e.
[00:09:20.596 --> 00:09:29.302]  the 2002 IMF World Bank documents that got leaked, to position societies out of free market, free systems, into
[00:09:30.103 --> 00:09:42.386]  False free market, controlled, vertically integrated, command and control, rigged, tilted playing field inside crony capitalist systems.
[00:09:43.227 --> 00:09:46.207]  They want you to be debtor slaves.
[00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:55.430]  And so of course, Geithner says, if you don't increase the debt limit, the debt ceiling, if you don't raise taxes, if you don't bring in more money, we will default.
[00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:01.272]  Because he was the former head of the private Federal Reserve, now the Treasury agent.
[00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:19.901]  The previous head of the Treasury was the former head of Goldman Sachs, shareholders in the private Federal Reserve, who positioned the tens of trillions of dollars of taxpayer money delivered to the private banks so they could shut down loans and use the money to consolidate even more power.
[00:10:20.822 --> 00:10:27.697]  So of course these Bernie Madoff, Ken Lay type scammers want us to be bankrupt.
[00:10:27.997 --> 00:10:29.821]  This has always been what they want.
[00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:32.906]  Now, the Republicans are riding in as the saviors.
[00:10:33.347 --> 00:10:44.012]  But remember, they went along with the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999, allowing the fractional reserve banking to go from 10 to 1 leveraging to nearly unlimited.
[00:10:44.072 --> 00:10:48.274]  They can create thousands of layers of leveraging.
[00:10:48.734 --> 00:10:53.317]  One dollar of deposits can be leveraged out into thousands of dollars.
[00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:56.098]  A million dollars can be leveraged into billions.
[00:10:56.558 --> 00:10:59.500]  Billions can be leveraged into trillions.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:12.171]  And when you go to the Davos own website, when you watch the announcements made by the Globalist in their public Bilderberg Group meetings, like Davos and Bretton Woods too, they openly say the American people can take on more debt.
[00:11:12.652 --> 00:11:13.733]  That is prosperity.
[00:11:14.393 --> 00:11:25.243]  This is a debt black hole set up in 1913, set up in other countries at different times, in Europe earlier, and most third world nations later, where for every dollar or euro
[00:11:26.184 --> 00:11:30.274]  Or yin or yan that is created for every peso that's created.
[00:11:30.354 --> 00:11:31.517]  Mexico does the same scam.
[00:11:31.537 --> 00:11:34.283]  They've devalued their currency and robbed their people many times.
[00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:47.529]  Every dollar or peso or euro that's created, a dollar or peso or euro or yen in debt is created to the private banking cartels.
[00:11:47.849 --> 00:11:51.012]  That's why the globalists launched the attacks on the Serbs in the 90s.
[00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:58.258]  Not that the Serbs were perfect, most governments are corrupt, but the point is they were a sovereign nation with their own factories, a growing population.
[00:11:59.119 --> 00:12:09.527]  And they had their own government bank issuing currency and credit as a way to supercharge the economy, not a monetarist system.
[00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:10.668]  Had to be attacked.
[00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:12.069]  Same thing with Libya.
[00:12:12.109 --> 00:12:19.936]  Had their own bank building up the country, using the water out of the aquifers, population exploding, building skyscrapers, building highways.
[00:12:21.016 --> 00:12:23.098]  Over half the graduates in college, women.
[00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:25.220]  Women not wearing hoods over their heads.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.140]  Had to be overthrown by Al Qaeda.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.041]  Happening now.
[00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:29.501]  Same thing in Egypt.
[00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:34.262]  Now they've got the modesty police in.
[00:12:34.322 --> 00:12:37.603]  They've banned all protest with the globalist-run new government.
[00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:38.883]  Same thing in Iraq.
[00:12:38.943 --> 00:12:42.164]  Throw out the old CIA chief who built up the country.
[00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:43.565]  Population more than doubled.
[00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:45.565]  Skyscrapers, rock and roll music.
[00:12:46.885 --> 00:12:48.506]  62% of college graduates women.
[00:12:49.466 --> 00:12:51.147]  Now they're wearing the headdresses.
[00:12:51.427 --> 00:12:52.408]  Now they're being taught.
[00:12:52.668 --> 00:12:57.251]  They're learning who Al-Qaeda is, the sword of the banking cartel.
[00:12:57.691 --> 00:13:00.353]  Al-Qaeda is then used to menace the United States.
[00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.035]  Then the globalists use it to crack down and take our liberties.
[00:13:03.495 --> 00:13:04.836]  This is the strategy.
[00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:28.742]  And so the Republicans coming in, all they're doing is ensuring we sign on to this fraudulent $14 trillion debt, itself a small unit of the $1.5 quadrillion, over 60% of that reportedly owed by the U.S., because the private bankers paid off our Congress to sign on to it through financial terrorism and threats of depression, October 3rd, 2008.
[00:13:31.004 --> 00:13:45.127]  Now, Geithner's back last week, and this weekend, and yesterday, saying, you will raise the debt ceiling, you will go into deeper debt to us, the private banks that he represents, or we're going to have a depression, and it's going to cause the default on the dollar.
[00:13:45.507 --> 00:13:48.928]  Technically, they're already monetizing over 70% of the debt.
[00:13:49.268 --> 00:13:51.068]  China's backing out of buying even more.
[00:13:51.309 --> 00:13:54.189]  The Saudis are moving away from buying it, knowing they're being double-crossed.
[00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:56.810]  And so we're rapidly, that's an old number of 70%.
[00:13:58.071 --> 00:14:06.332]  They're estimating in the Wall Street Journal will now be over 75% with the Chinese announcing they're going to cut how many T-bills they're buying even more and dump T-bills they've got.
[00:14:07.321 --> 00:14:12.383]  And so they're technically defaulting by hyperinflation of the dollar.
[00:14:12.724 --> 00:14:21.207]  And they're getting ready to scapegoat anybody who tries to tell the bankers, we don't owe you these hundreds and hundreds of trillions you've gotten us to sign on to.
[00:14:22.008 --> 00:14:30.992]  And a great case point example of this, this is so central is why I'm covering it first, not the open announcement of the ground invasion of Libya.
[00:14:31.392 --> 00:14:38.734]  It's already been going on for over a month and a half, but now they're just announcing it and got the troop ships and the Marines ready to land, as we told you five weeks ago.
[00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:44.095]  That's right, before the UN resolution, we told you, U.S.-British Special Forces were there.
[00:14:44.435 --> 00:14:45.955]  Now the State Department's admitting that.
[00:14:46.315 --> 00:14:47.716]  Now they're putting in more troops.
[00:14:48.336 --> 00:14:50.716]  It's incredible, and that's all part of this larger empire.
[00:14:51.217 --> 00:14:57.058]  But before I get to that, I want to continue on the rest of this segment on the banking cartel takeover.
[00:14:58.203 --> 00:15:23.904]  So the Democrats, they're playing the left-wing part of the New World Order fraudulent choice deception, and they are saying it's going to take Social Security, it's going to take Medicare and Medicaid, it's going to starve old people to death, it's going to kill them with no medical care if we don't raise the debt ceiling and get deeper into this unsustainable, crippling system that was built by design.
[00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.670]  I don't
[00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:53.039]  Not just some of the real debt that's small in comparison to the derivatives that our system actually owes, but the overall Ponzi scheme of the 1.5 quadrillion globally.
[00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:55.761]  Again, over 60% of that our government signed on to.
[00:15:57.628 --> 00:16:00.090]  And so they're not addressing the private Federal Reserve.
[00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:15.501]  And Ron Paul's got a new article out today at InfoWars.com, where he says, all of this spending cutting, all of the discussions of it, all the budget talk, means nothing if you don't get transparency and audit the Fed and shut down this system.
[00:16:15.862 --> 00:16:23.908]  It is a financial black hole where a dollar of debt, let me explain this, is created every time a dollar is issued.
[00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:42.760]  So, as the Federal Reserve says, okay, Treasury, we'll buy, with fiat made-up digits and a computer, we'll buy your 70-plus percent of monetized T-bills, and that's how they create the debt system to issue the currency, and we'll do it by making you go more into debt to us.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.283]  It's all made up, but they get our tax money and real assets.
[00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:49.948]  This is exactly what the banksters want, and they're on record.
[00:16:50.229 --> 00:17:14.942]  So they've been getting more power, using their control of issuance of currency and credit for decades to maneuver the United States from the greatest creditor nation, wealthiest nation, the most patents, 10% growth rates on average for the first 160 years of our nation, to now where we are, where we work more hours than anybody else in the world, we have the highest corporate private government debt,
[00:17:16.761 --> 00:17:18.322]  And things are just unraveling.
[00:17:19.363 --> 00:17:33.233]  And their answer is, oh, we do owe this debt, when the truth is, the money system is designed under the private federal reserve to reduce you to absolute serfs, as Thomas Jefferson said 230 years ago.
[00:17:33.254 --> 00:17:40.079]  In fact, pull me the Thomas Jefferson quote about waking up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[00:17:40.739 --> 00:17:43.121]  And same thing Andrew Jackson talked about.
[00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:44.362]  Same thing Lincoln talked about.
[00:17:45.185 --> 00:17:46.846]  Lincoln wouldn't take loans from these people.
[00:17:46.866 --> 00:17:50.630]  He issued his own government currency, and they shot him in the head for it.
[00:17:52.251 --> 00:17:55.974]  This is the fight that any nation is going to face.
[00:17:56.155 --> 00:17:57.035]  Any free nation.
[00:17:57.356 --> 00:18:01.719]  Or even if it's not a free nation like Libya, any sovereign nation is going to face.
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.001]  Like Serbia.
[00:18:03.971 --> 00:18:09.013]  If you try to not let this offshore global corporate cartel run your life, it's over.
[00:18:09.413 --> 00:18:20.218]  Now, meanwhile, the Democrats are out there who help build the unsustainable system, help get rid of Glass-Steagall, know full well what they're doing at the leadership levels, taking their orders from the private central banks.
[00:18:20.618 --> 00:18:25.360]  They're now going to sick the giant dependent class around half the country.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.061]  And that includes defense contractors.
[00:18:27.081 --> 00:18:28.322]  You live off government contracts.
[00:18:28.643 --> 00:18:29.603]  The welfare queens.
[00:18:30.184 --> 00:18:31.285]  The corporate welfare people.
[00:18:31.405 --> 00:18:31.745]  All of you.
[00:18:32.045 --> 00:18:48.118]  They're going to sick this coalition on what's left of the middle class to not fund us into the future, because it'll only fund things for a few months, but to destroy that group of politically independent, motivated thinkers who aren't dependent.
[00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:52.302]  So right now the globalists aren't just mopping up what's left of sovereign nations.
[00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:56.374]  They are now mopping up middle classes worldwide.
[00:18:56.394 --> 00:18:58.936]  Let me read you this quote, 200 plus years ago.
[00:18:58.956 --> 00:19:19.014]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation, you're seeing that, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them, Federal Reserve secretly funding private media and corporations everywhere with your tax money, again, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property.
[00:19:19.701 --> 00:19:26.465]  Again, they get property taxes, state taxes passed, and then that money's paid in corporate welfare to them, and debt to be able to use the currency.
[00:19:26.866 --> 00:19:28.987]  See, this is the same war!
[00:19:30.208 --> 00:19:46.679]  If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered.
[00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:52.083]  I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.
[00:19:52.364 --> 00:19:57.728]  The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.
[00:19:57.969 --> 00:19:59.130]  That means the Congress.
[00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:00.010]  Stay with us!

[00:20:30.413 --> 00:20:39.679]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.739 --> 00:20:40.480]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:46.684]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.804 --> 00:20:47.625]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:50.767]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[00:23:46.608 --> 00:23:48.129]  Lecig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[00:24:12.486 --> 00:24:24.441]  The system is only getting away with what they're doing because it is somewhat sophisticated what's happening.
[00:24:25.455 --> 00:24:32.958]  But when you study history, you realize that every society, going back to Rome, goes through this money manipulation.
[00:24:33.018 --> 00:24:39.340]  Because insider elites learn that they can take the gold and the silver out of the coins and put out copper.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.241]  And then they can debase the copper.
[00:24:42.141 --> 00:24:44.522]  And they can come out with clay coins.
[00:24:45.522 --> 00:24:51.946]  They learn that they can, when people deposit their gold at the bank, that they can issue checks.
[00:24:52.426 --> 00:24:55.068]  People don't want to carry their gold around with them and get conked on the head.
[00:24:55.088 --> 00:25:00.911]  And then they can start loaning out ten times the real gold they have and buying real things with it.
[00:25:01.291 --> 00:25:04.353]  And getting people into debt for paper that costs nothing.
[00:25:05.404 --> 00:25:27.411]  But the globalists have taken that multi-thousand-year-old money-changing manipulation that angered Christ so much at the temple, because it was going on in ancient Israel as well, going on in ancient China, and every time a culture deploys this and allows an elite to do this, they basically have a money machine to take over.
[00:25:28.342 --> 00:25:31.164]  But see, they don't just want to buy things with their free money.
[00:25:31.464 --> 00:25:32.885]  They want to loan it to you at 10%, 30%.
[00:25:34.426 --> 00:25:41.130]  Now many credit cards, CNN reports, 79.9 APR annual percentage.
[00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.431]  I mean, that's more than double.
[00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:44.692]  Loan sharking is 25 to 30.
[00:25:47.333 --> 00:25:48.994]  More than double loan sharking.
[00:25:50.115 --> 00:25:53.557]  That was the credit card reform legislation a year and a half ago with Obama.
[00:25:55.595 --> 00:26:05.165]  He'd read off the teleprompter he was going to lower your credit card rates and it went up to past 79.9!
[00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:08.348]  I mean, that is incredible!
[00:26:09.129 --> 00:26:17.337]  And that's what's so amazing about this, is that they've gotten this dependent, they've gotten an army of people who live off the government,
[00:26:19.918 --> 00:26:21.719]  And they don't understand what's going on.
[00:26:21.819 --> 00:26:26.903]  You've got the mega-rich, who are many wealthy, that are way above.
[00:26:26.923 --> 00:26:33.367]  I mean, the Rockefellers, a hundred plus years ago on record, had four or five billion dollars per family member.
[00:26:33.627 --> 00:26:38.371]  And that was billions of dollars in 1906 numbers, when there was an audit done by Congress of them.
[00:26:39.366 --> 00:26:42.028]  And you think Bill Gates with 60 billion is the richest man in the world?
[00:26:42.348 --> 00:26:44.470]  A billion today is what a million was back then.
[00:26:45.151 --> 00:27:04.006]  These people, the Russian government, what, a decade ago, put out a prospectus on Western money and said that there's a private group basically managing Europe and the Anglo-American system that has over 300 trillion in liquid gold and other liquid assets.
[00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:08.228]  Three hundred trillion dollars!
[00:27:08.508 --> 00:27:09.829]  That was a decade ago!
[00:27:12.551 --> 00:27:15.533]  Because... Here's what's exciting.
[00:27:15.713 --> 00:27:16.954]  I monitor talk radio.
[00:27:17.314 --> 00:27:18.275]  I monitor it in the morning.
[00:27:18.335 --> 00:27:19.876]  I monitor it on XM at my house.
[00:27:19.976 --> 00:27:23.158]  I monitor TV shows, but I mainly listen.
[00:27:23.278 --> 00:27:24.379]  That way I can be doing other things.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:31.804]  And now suddenly, not just Michael Savage last week, but I was listening to 1370 last night, driving home
[00:27:35.464 --> 00:27:45.192]  and and doing some errands off and on over an hour and I was listening to WAI out of San Antonio as well and I heard all the local hosts and national hosts
[00:27:48.087 --> 00:27:59.711]  Openly having guessed on, one guy had pulled surprise winners on, talking about how it's not just poor people that aren't paying taxes, or income taxes.
[00:27:59.891 --> 00:28:01.231]  Poor people do pay a lot of other taxes.
[00:28:01.972 --> 00:28:07.834]  That the mega-elite have written the rules offshore to not pay taxes, but they went one step further.
[00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:08.934]  That's been known for a long time.
[00:28:09.374 --> 00:28:13.996]  That those mega-rich and mega-corporations lobby government
[00:28:14.756 --> 00:28:18.199]  To put restrictions on the middle class to shut down their competition.
[00:28:18.739 --> 00:28:20.861]  I was almost crying with joy.
[00:28:21.841 --> 00:28:24.964]  Because suddenly once people get something, it spreads like wildfire.
[00:28:25.404 --> 00:28:27.085]  This is such positive news.
[00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:31.148]  For my children's future, for your children's future.
[00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:32.949]  But we're not going to have to wait for this to hurt our children.
[00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.130]  This is hurting us now.
[00:28:34.551 --> 00:28:37.513]  People always say, well, we're putting this debt off on the next generation.
[00:28:37.713 --> 00:28:38.213]  Well, guess what?
[00:28:38.233 --> 00:28:39.274]  We've been hearing that for 30 years.
[00:28:39.554 --> 00:28:40.715]  Here we are, next generation.
[00:28:41.015 --> 00:28:41.696]  It's happening now.
[00:28:43.339 --> 00:28:54.861]  But I'm just listening all over the place and I'm hearing former neocons and mainline conservatives breaking it down and saying this is a rigged insider deal.
[00:28:56.553 --> 00:29:16.404]  And explaining that the ultra-rich are using government and the dumbed-down, you know, domesticated welfare people as a weapon against the middle class, and that if you took all of the middle class, from 100,000 up to, you know, billions a year, the wealthiest, who are still paying the tax system and live here domestically.
[00:29:17.688 --> 00:29:25.389]  That if you took all their money and run the country for three and a half months, now if you took the bankers' money, it's unlimited and unknown, then all our problems would be solved.
[00:29:26.129 --> 00:29:32.070]  I'm not even saying, quote, take their money, write it off, say this is your fiat, black hole, fake garbage, we don't owe you this.
[00:29:32.531 --> 00:29:44.833]  I mean, they admitted in Greece, and in Ireland especially, Ireland and in Iceland, the people owed less than 10% of those actual debts, all the rest of it was derivatives the private banks had created, who were offshore.
[00:29:45.353 --> 00:29:46.453]  But they owned the government.
[00:29:47.213 --> 00:29:49.135]  Officials, so they sign them on to it.
[00:29:49.495 --> 00:29:49.875]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.116 --> 00:29:52.017]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.518 --> 00:29:54.119]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.722]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.903]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:05.223 --> 00:30:05.823]  Number 1.
[00:30:06.123 --> 00:30:09.285]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.546 --> 00:30:10.106]  Number 2.
[00:30:10.406 --> 00:30:14.969]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.309 --> 00:30:15.750]  It's true.
[00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:20.613]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.913 --> 00:30:21.473]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.753 --> 00:30:25.035]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:29.038]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.238 --> 00:30:29.778]  Number 4.
[00:30:30.038 --> 00:30:32.399]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:36.181]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:36.681]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:41.183]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.403 --> 00:30:46.165]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:00.794 --> 00:31:07.460]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:31:07.741 --> 00:31:10.103]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:31:10.383 --> 00:31:12.605]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:31:12.825 --> 00:31:16.989]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:31:17.189 --> 00:31:18.671]  You must act automatically.
[00:31:18.891 --> 00:31:22.074]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:31:22.394 --> 00:31:24.877]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:31:25.177 --> 00:31:33.165]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:31:33.525 --> 00:31:36.328]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:31:36.568 --> 00:31:46.214]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[00:31:48.336 --> 00:31:50.837]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[00:32:00.323 --> 00:32:01.444]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.484 --> 00:32:08.167]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.427 --> 00:32:10.708]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.968 --> 00:32:16.151]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.351 --> 00:32:19.133]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.393 --> 00:32:21.514]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.715 --> 00:32:27.638]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.959 --> 00:32:31.161]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.341 --> 00:32:36.864]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.124 --> 00:32:38.425]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.765 --> 00:32:39.926]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:40.066 --> 00:32:42.588]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.728 --> 00:32:46.790]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:51.432]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:32:51.572 --> 00:32:54.033]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:32:54.173 --> 00:32:57.874]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.

[00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:09.439]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.952]  Dick Russell, the co-author of Jesse Ventura's new best-selling book
[00:33:24.309 --> 00:33:30.375]  Sixty-three documents the government doesn't want you to read is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:33:30.895 --> 00:33:32.717]  And I agree with about 98% of the book.
[00:33:33.738 --> 00:33:47.431]  The fact that they go after the Koch brothers in this book, I just think compared to government-sponsored terror, government-sponsored drug dealing, and things like that, the Koch brothers having meetings that are publicly advertised
[00:33:48.612 --> 00:34:08.325]  uh... you know trying to quote restore the republic in the second amendment and property rights uh... you know act like this is some frightening horrible evil uh... it just doesn't fit in with the rest of the book but but again the book is available at info wars dot com excellent page turner and very informative
[00:34:08.905 --> 00:34:20.288]  You can also get it discounted with Mark Dice's new great book, Big Brother The Orwellian Nightmare Come True, and get one of my films of your choice free at Infowars.com.
[00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:30.391]  Okay, I've been ranting in the first couple segments dealing with the situation we've now reached.
[00:34:31.551 --> 00:34:34.072]  But as we went to break, I talked about how suddenly
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:44.642]  Almost every mainline, neocon, slash libertarian, conservative, whatever you want to call them, talk show, that I now monitor.
[00:34:44.662 --> 00:34:56.824]  Because I'll listen to one for 15 minutes and flip, or while I'm busy helping cook dinner, or while I'm busy, you know, researching news, I'll have it on in the background when I'm stuck in traffic.
[00:34:57.405 --> 00:34:58.805]  I'm seeing a major shift.
[00:34:58.845 --> 00:35:00.425]  This is very, very positive.
[00:35:01.245 --> 00:35:03.906]  I mean, this morning I listened to Laura Ingram for about 10 minutes.
[00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:23.470]  And she was explaining to mainline libertarians that there are elite corporations and insiders that sign trade deals that are unfair and that aren't a level playing field through globalism that's de-industrialized the United States.
[00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:31.972]  And she was saying, you libertarians that are for complete open and free trade, it doesn't work if it's only called free and open trade.
[00:35:33.055 --> 00:35:40.025]  If there are tax incentives to move out of the U.S., and China lowers their currency, and China has slave labor,
[00:35:41.124 --> 00:35:43.526]  Then that isn't free or open or fair trade.
[00:35:44.567 --> 00:35:50.231]  Or if insiders like General Electric lobby to be able to build power plants in the U.S.
[00:35:50.391 --> 00:36:02.160]  and China, but then lobby to shut down their competition, and they actually run the White House through the Economic Board, she didn't go that far, but she was explaining it in layman's terms, that that's not libertarian.
[00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:04.822]  I mean, it's so simple to say, I'm libertarian!
[00:36:06.494 --> 00:36:08.435]  Yes, get rid of our borders completely.
[00:36:08.455 --> 00:36:10.395]  You know, have no tariffs in trade.
[00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:13.416]  Well, what if all the other countries don't play along with that?
[00:36:13.976 --> 00:36:15.036]  You shut down.
[00:36:17.356 --> 00:36:19.097]  So they're not living in the real world.
[00:36:20.257 --> 00:36:22.737]  I am what you could call a constitutionalist.
[00:36:22.797 --> 00:36:24.218]  I believe in libertarian ideas.
[00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:31.799]  But at the same time, you have to be a big boy and actually understand the players you're dealing with.
[00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:35.240]  I mean, a lot of libertarians I know say get rid of the military entirely.
[00:36:37.244 --> 00:36:49.821]  Well, the problem is there are other big corrupt status regimes like Russia and China who guaranteed would try to come in here and take control, at least of the countries around us, because that's how systems work.
[00:36:50.382 --> 00:36:53.466]  It needs to be a global culture of liberty that
[00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:57.874]  has an idea whose time has come and no army can stop that.
[00:36:58.635 --> 00:37:13.181]  And we need to, through the peaceful means, take control of every nation on earth and change our minds about the systems of government and restore liberty for a global spirit of 1776 and take back each nation.
[00:37:13.661 --> 00:37:18.984]  And the nations that respect freedom and liberty and who are libertarian, we then trade with them.
[00:37:22.805 --> 00:37:23.025]  All right.
[00:37:23.666 --> 00:37:26.088]  I'm now digressing, and this happens every day.
[00:37:26.148 --> 00:37:27.008]  I've got all this.
[00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:34.955]  I mean, in the old days, 15 years ago, 16 years ago, I would talk for probably two, three hours just on one of these articles I've got here in front of me.
[00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:41.300]  And now, every stack, I could talk for three hours about.
[00:37:42.881 --> 00:37:44.162]  Every single stack.
[00:37:44.563 --> 00:37:46.664]  Later in the third hour, I want to get into more Gellons.
[00:37:47.185 --> 00:37:50.567]  I've never really talked about this disease
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:38:01.186]  This parasitic type disease that scientists in Germany, the United States, major universities have pulled out the fibers.
[00:38:01.266 --> 00:38:03.147]  It appears to be some type of nanotech.
[00:38:03.768 --> 00:38:07.870]  Certainly there are schizophrenics and others who then hear about it and then decide they have it.
[00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.392]  But that doesn't mean that everybody's crazy who's getting it.
[00:38:11.773 --> 00:38:14.895]  And I've done a lot of research over the years trying to decide
[00:38:16.223 --> 00:38:29.088]  Whether I believe it's real or not, but now researching nanotech, there are systems hiding in plain view that clearly fit the bill of Morgellons, or Morgellons-type nanotech technologies.
[00:38:29.488 --> 00:38:41.593]  Just like the old-timers back in the mid-90s, scientists, environmental researchers, forest service, toxicologists, I mean, so many of them that came out, like Clifford Carnicom and others,
[00:38:42.759 --> 00:38:50.648]  They did the samples, got the aircraft, flew behind Kim trailing aircraft, said it's barium salts, aluminum dioxide, and a list of things.
[00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:57.356]  And now two years ago, the White House Science Czar comes out and says, yeah, we've been doing secret testing since the early 90s.
[00:38:58.497 --> 00:39:01.661]  He mentioned the guy that got a Nobel Prize in, what, 92 for it.
[00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:10.873]  We have been testing spraying the atmosphere to protect you from radiation from the sun because of global warming and our deteriorating atmosphere.
[00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:15.815]  And all the giant programs we've had are still classified, but we can tell you they've been going on.
[00:39:15.835 --> 00:39:20.917]  And then he listed the exact things that people 16, 17 years ago broke down that it was.
[00:39:24.429 --> 00:39:33.920]  And they admit that all of these huge programs have just been the test, and now they're debating going public with massive global geoengineering terraforming weather modification.
[00:39:35.122 --> 00:39:40.488]  CFR two years ago put out a big 30-something page report admitting it's been going on and trying to sell it.
[00:39:40.528 --> 00:39:41.409]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:43.452]  Bill Gates has invested billions in it.
[00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:48.734]  The Arab countries are putting up antenna farms, manipulating the weather.
[00:39:48.834 --> 00:39:50.056]  I mean, it's on.
[00:39:50.576 --> 00:39:52.499]  But the American people were told it doesn't exist.
[00:39:52.779 --> 00:39:54.120]  Conspiracy theorists talk about it.
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:54.881]  It doesn't exist.
[00:39:55.161 --> 00:39:57.904]  So most Americans still don't even know there's weather modification.
[00:39:58.405 --> 00:40:01.448]  It doesn't matter that it's totally admitted and going on globally.
[00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:03.250]  They just say, no, it doesn't exist.
[00:40:04.147 --> 00:40:06.488]  A lot of Americans say there's not a private fellow reserve still.
[00:40:06.749 --> 00:40:07.809]  Or there's not a Bilderberg group.
[00:40:08.169 --> 00:40:10.871]  I still have occasionally a waiter come up and laugh at me.
[00:40:10.911 --> 00:40:12.432]  You know, generally they're a listener and supportive.
[00:40:12.852 --> 00:40:21.417]  But maybe one time out of 20, the waiter comes up or the lady at the checkout line at the grocery store and says, are the black helicopters going to get me?
[00:40:21.697 --> 00:40:23.278]  Are they manipulating the weather?
[00:40:23.718 --> 00:40:26.740]  Oh, is the Bilderberger hamburger group going to get me?
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.381]  And they giggle and I just giggle back and go, that's right.
[00:40:29.401 --> 00:40:30.442]  It's real funny, isn't it?
[00:40:30.822 --> 00:40:31.943]  It's real funny.
[00:40:33.476 --> 00:40:38.082]  But here's an article out of Science Newsline.
[00:40:39.004 --> 00:40:41.187]  University of Michigan has put this report out.
[00:40:41.247 --> 00:40:48.416]  Researchers inject nanofiber spheres carrying cells into wounds to grow tissue.
[00:40:49.924 --> 00:41:01.415]  And the system is a nanotech tissue growth system that is little strands and researching it, it looks exactly like and behaves exactly like Morgellons.
[00:41:01.695 --> 00:41:09.142]  Little strings that then form balls that then other little metastasizing strings grow out of.
[00:41:09.722 --> 00:41:15.267]  And it uses the energy in the tissue, it uses the vitamins and minerals and oxygen to grow.
[00:41:16.152 --> 00:41:30.020]  And then I think back to just News 8 Austin just a few weeks ago, here in Austin with a Morgellons conference that I meant to go to but I shouldn't have time, interviewing medical doctor after medical doctor going, we believe it's a form of nanotech, it grows, it forms these spheres and then grows.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.860]  And then here it is, University of Michigan.
[00:41:31.881 --> 00:41:34.362]  Folks, there's all these companies developing this stuff.
[00:41:34.782 --> 00:41:37.664]  What do you think happens when you have thousands of biotech companies all over the world?
[00:41:38.664 --> 00:41:45.271]  Open air, planting, part insect, part plant, part mammal, part insect, part fish, part insect.
[00:41:46.032 --> 00:41:58.404]  I mean, there are hundreds of different GMO salmon that are part insect, part human, cows that are part human that produce human milk, BBC, goats that are part human, chimpanzees that are part human.
[00:41:58.904 --> 00:42:09.089]  And this is all news, and I know yuppies are driving along that only know about the Final Four and all this, or about baseball season and the Rangers beating the Yankees, and they're like, this guy's crazy, Marge.
[00:42:09.369 --> 00:42:11.490]  He's talking about part spider, part human.
[00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:25.596]  Look, if you won't Google goats that are part human, goats that are part spider, chimpanzees that are part human, I remember the Washington Post nine years ago said, well, the laboratories won't allow people to see it.
[00:42:26.954 --> 00:42:29.756]  And a few years later, I even read the article on Ian Punnett's show on Costa Costa.
[00:42:29.776 --> 00:42:31.377]  He had trouble believing it until he pulled it up.
[00:42:32.818 --> 00:42:38.042]  And it said, but yes, down in Costa Rica, there's some of the labs, and they have part chimpanzee, part human creatures.
[00:42:38.303 --> 00:42:40.624]  But they won't let people in to see them, but there's some U.S.
[00:42:40.664 --> 00:42:41.625]  government funding for it.
[00:42:41.645 --> 00:42:42.666]  They do it outside the U.S.
[00:42:42.686 --> 00:42:43.266]  where it's legal.
[00:42:43.927 --> 00:42:47.029]  And the question is, do these chimpanzees that are now part human have rights?
[00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:49.251]  And of course, if they're doing it for organ harvesting.
[00:42:50.353 --> 00:42:56.196]  They've got pigs that they, I remember 12 years ago, BBC, that are part human that grow human hearts, and they're testing them.
[00:42:56.456 --> 00:43:02.980]  You know, the issue here is, what do you think all this mad science splicing is going to do?
[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.982]  Well, there are already cases of oak trees in the U.S.
[00:43:06.002 --> 00:43:08.463]  with corn growing out of the side of them, from GMO.
[00:43:09.183 --> 00:43:11.605]  Just corn stalks start growing out of the ends of the oak buds.
[00:43:13.544 --> 00:43:13.724]  They're
[00:43:28.704 --> 00:43:40.713]  A plant with fungus, pesticide that grows at 1,000 times normal levels inside of it, or that has insect genes, or that's pharmacological, thousands of those crops.
[00:43:41.913 --> 00:43:45.636]  Protea gene came out with one that had HIV in the corn.
[00:43:46.977 --> 00:43:49.859]  AP, 2002, planted it open air in several areas of the U.S.
[00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:52.541]  until the government found out and made them burn it.
[00:43:54.394 --> 00:44:01.983]  I mean, I could go on for 10 hours, and anything I say, you can just Google the term I use, and it'll come right up, mainstream news.
[00:44:03.145 --> 00:44:04.767]  But never telling you it's dangerous.
[00:44:05.688 --> 00:44:13.677]  So of course there's all these companies and universities and labs looking at nanotech within the body, and injecting it in people that are part of trials.
[00:44:14.878 --> 00:44:24.921]  I mean, the government has tacitly admitted that Lyme's disease was a Nazi invention, weaponized Lyme's disease, brought, admittedly run by Nazis, at Plum Island.
[00:44:26.642 --> 00:44:42.527]  The head of the Nazi bioweapons system was brought there, and that deer, because it's not too far away from the East Coast coastline, when deer start starving, they'll swim miles, swam in with the Lyme's disease, and then now we have that.
[00:44:42.907 --> 00:44:43.628]  Also, that
[00:44:45.131 --> 00:44:46.692]  The West Nile came from Plum Island.
[00:44:48.453 --> 00:44:54.236]  I mean, you know about the government injecting black people with syphilis, but now it comes out they're injecting people all over the world with syphilis.
[00:44:54.716 --> 00:44:55.657]  The UN's been caught.
[00:44:56.137 --> 00:45:02.481]  The UN's been caught adding to the Dr. Salk polio vaccine, a live cancer virus, knowingly.
[00:45:03.979 --> 00:45:05.340]  It's estimated by the U.S.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:15.707]  government, pull it up, that over a hundred million Americans from the 1950s until the latest numbers that came out a few years ago died from what were previously unknown or rare cancers.
[00:45:17.861 --> 00:45:22.465]  They described some of the cancers as, like, purple yogurt pouring out of the nose.
[00:45:23.005 --> 00:45:24.546]  You know, cancers in the sinus.
[00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:26.668]  I mean, just listing hundreds of these things.
[00:45:27.789 --> 00:45:32.492]  And so, oh, they're testing nanotech injected into the body that grows little strands.
[00:45:32.973 --> 00:45:41.279]  Oh, jeepers creepers, other scientists have found citizens in the last decade with this all over the world that have it, and that's exactly what the scientists said they thought it was.
[00:45:41.619 --> 00:45:45.683]  And then magically, it turns out there's a whole class of research going on for decades.
[00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:48.862]  Let's inject people with nanotech!
[00:45:53.565 --> 00:46:04.071]  Do you realize that almost every corn variety in Latin America, some of them thousands of years old, has been infected by the GMO crops?
[00:46:05.551 --> 00:46:10.554]  The entire system is being butchered and assaulted and attacked.
[00:46:10.574 --> 00:46:11.955]  See, I said I'd cover this later in the show.
[00:46:13.188 --> 00:46:14.589]  And I will get to it more in the third hour.
[00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:19.314]  That is one article, out of no exaggeration, I've got to have 50 or 60 here in front of me.
[00:46:20.855 --> 00:46:22.477]  Oh, let me tell you what else is going on.
[00:46:22.757 --> 00:46:26.981]  I haven't even gotten in to the top news story today.
[00:46:28.142 --> 00:46:36.250]  Something off the charts, incredible, but we knew it was already going on and coming, but it's incredible to see them again do exactly what we knew they would do.
[00:46:38.442 --> 00:47:00.226]  Going back more than six months ago, and previously four years before that, U.S.-British Special Forces, CIA, MI6, were in eastern Libya with the breakaway al-Qaeda, Wahhabist-connected, Saudi Arabian-funded groups, getting ready to try to overthrow Gaddafi while the globalists made peace deals with him.
[00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:05.553]  It's now admitted that from day one, British Special Forces, U.S.
[00:47:05.593 --> 00:47:07.855]  Special Forces, and CIA have been there.
[00:47:08.035 --> 00:47:09.236]  That came out before the U.N.
[00:47:09.256 --> 00:47:11.037]  resolution, buried in newspapers.
[00:47:12.638 --> 00:47:14.400]  Now, it's in the L.A.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.861]  Times today.
[00:47:18.643 --> 00:47:18.863]  L.A.
[00:47:18.963 --> 00:47:20.024]  Times today.
[00:47:20.784 --> 00:47:27.669]  Now, again, over a month ago, we wrote almost the exact headline with the links to the State Department's admissions.
[00:47:28.516 --> 00:47:29.276]  But here it is.
[00:47:29.937 --> 00:47:30.737]  This is L.A.
[00:47:30.817 --> 00:47:31.218]  Times.
[00:47:31.618 --> 00:47:32.919]  Again, not tooting our horn.
[00:47:33.019 --> 00:47:34.920]  How many times are we 100% right?
[00:47:36.381 --> 00:47:39.843]  Libyan rebel story shows links to Taliban, Al-Qaeda, NATO.
[00:47:40.343 --> 00:47:44.585]  And they go on to admit from the beginning it was launched by NATO with Al-Qaeda and Taliban help.
[00:47:44.785 --> 00:47:44.926]  L.A.
[00:47:44.946 --> 00:47:45.186]  Times.
[00:47:45.766 --> 00:47:46.787]  Nothing new to this audience.
[00:47:48.428 --> 00:47:48.688]  Okay?
[00:47:49.808 --> 00:47:52.170]  This just came out a day ago in the L.A.
[00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:52.490]  Times.
[00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.712]  Now, what did the EU announce yesterday?
[00:47:57.210 --> 00:47:57.750]  The EU!
[00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:58.410]  Callin' the shots!
[00:47:58.850 --> 00:48:00.571]  The EU tells the UN to do a resolution.
[00:48:00.751 --> 00:48:01.551]  They have a resolution.
[00:48:01.591 --> 00:48:05.172]  Within 36 hours, Obama doesn't even consult Congress, launches an attack.
[00:48:06.293 --> 00:48:07.033]  Remember all of that.
[00:48:08.173 --> 00:48:12.134]  Openly establishing the UN as the world government, and the EU giving them the orders.
[00:48:13.194 --> 00:48:16.015]  Now, and who owns the majority of our private Federal Reserve?
[00:48:16.575 --> 00:48:17.516]  EU-based banks.
[00:48:17.576 --> 00:48:18.396]  Not American banks.
[00:48:18.656 --> 00:48:19.976]  Where did most of the bailout money go?
[00:48:20.196 --> 00:48:20.877]  Foreign banks.
[00:48:21.257 --> 00:48:22.337]  And to buy off corporations.
[00:48:23.953 --> 00:48:27.375]  Remember, we're being colonized again through economic slavery.
[00:48:27.475 --> 00:48:29.476]  Now, what did the EU announce last night?
[00:48:30.917 --> 00:48:32.038]  And I'm very proud of Watson.
[00:48:32.158 --> 00:48:35.040]  Even before The Guardian had their report out, Watson added his out.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:48.288]  Then he later added The Guardian's link in there when they came out with it off the YouTube video a listener sent him of the EU announcing they are going to the UN with the authorization to put in a thousand or more humanitarian troops who will help
[00:48:49.301 --> 00:48:55.584]  Take over the country, the roads and infrastructure, and if Qaddafi resists them, it's called terrorism.
[00:48:55.924 --> 00:49:06.570]  So, they're bombing them from the air, coming in with al-Qaeda, the advisors, the troops, the weapons being brought in out of Egypt that first had to be taken down because Mubarak wouldn't go along with this.
[00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:08.531]  Saudi Arabia bringing weapons and fighters in.
[00:49:11.377 --> 00:49:12.378]  The whole time, U.S.
[00:49:12.458 --> 00:49:15.659]  ships massed off the coast with Marines, British ships with Marines.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:20.903]  March 2nd, the Marine Corps commander, Camp Lejeune, said, we're preparing for ground invasion.
[00:49:21.423 --> 00:49:22.864]  And more ships shipped out.
[00:49:22.924 --> 00:49:23.764]  They've now arrived.
[00:49:24.144 --> 00:49:25.305]  They're massing the fleet off.
[00:49:25.545 --> 00:49:27.806]  And Obama said, in fact, look for this clip, I meant to tell you.
[00:49:27.827 --> 00:49:31.849]  Now go to YouTube, type in something like, Obama pledges we will never have ground troops.
[00:49:31.869 --> 00:49:36.952]  Remember he said just four weeks ago, we will never, never have ground troops.
[00:49:37.252 --> 00:49:38.693]  You have my promise on that.
[00:49:38.993 --> 00:49:39.193]  U.S.
[00:49:39.213 --> 00:49:40.514]  ground troops were already in there.
[00:49:42.148 --> 00:49:42.648]  He knows that.
[00:49:42.669 --> 00:49:47.333]  I mean, it's just... I mean, I thought Bill Clinton was bad, saying, How dare you?
[00:49:47.393 --> 00:49:49.775]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:49:49.815 --> 00:49:52.277]  How dare you?
[00:49:53.118 --> 00:49:55.200]  Just brazen lying doesn't get in trouble for it.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:01.185]  Well, this is lying about this war, regardless of what you think of Gaddafi and his clown suits.
[00:50:01.686 --> 00:50:06.030]  The point is, he made a deal six years ago, gave up his WMDs, played nice,
[00:50:07.492 --> 00:50:21.645]  And now they're trying to have Al-Qaeda back groups overthrow him and our stinking government takes you in orders to do it, lies to us and says bombing every square inch of the infrastructure, the government buildings, the military bases, all of it.
[00:50:22.878 --> 00:50:23.819]  That's not war.
[00:50:24.339 --> 00:50:25.500]  That's a kinetic action.
[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.743]  Then there's advisors all over, helping organize and give weapons to the rebels.
[00:50:30.244 --> 00:50:32.365]  And they admitted a month ago, U.S.
[00:50:32.425 --> 00:50:38.370]  and British forces on the ground, lazing Qaddafi government targets, targeting them.
[00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:40.131]  They call that, that's not a war.
[00:50:41.112 --> 00:50:44.995]  Somebody aims a laser at your house, and they drop a 2,000 pound bomb on it, that's not war.
[00:50:45.984 --> 00:50:46.865]  That's humanitarian.
[00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:50.708]  Now they admit, yes, they're getting the ground invasion ready.
[00:50:51.228 --> 00:50:52.790]  And then it gets even more insane.
[00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:55.252]  I told you about this all over the country.
[00:50:55.712 --> 00:50:59.636]  New York's moving to ban dodgeball, tag, King of the Hill.
[00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:05.511]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[00:51:05.911 --> 00:51:06.411]  The U.S.
[00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:13.214]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[00:51:13.754 --> 00:51:16.395]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[00:51:16.475 --> 00:51:18.676]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation,
[00:51:19.116 --> 00:51:19.716]  And the U.S.
[00:51:19.797 --> 00:51:22.858]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators.
[00:51:23.138 --> 00:51:26.400]  The Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.062]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[00:51:29.102 --> 00:51:29.562]  Treasuries.
[00:51:29.982 --> 00:51:33.424]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[00:51:33.484 --> 00:51:39.047]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[00:51:39.428 --> 00:51:41.569]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans.
[00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:47.435]  To sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[00:51:47.875 --> 00:51:57.245]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[00:52:00.339 --> 00:52:04.801]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:13.665]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.

[00:52:59.944 --> 00:53:01.204]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.264 --> 00:53:06.606]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:06.846 --> 00:53:11.467]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:11.867 --> 00:53:12.267]  It's true.
[00:53:12.327 --> 00:53:14.908]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[00:53:15.148 --> 00:53:16.889]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.429 --> 00:53:22.134]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:22.655 --> 00:53:29.583]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:29.783 --> 00:53:30.664]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:30.905 --> 00:53:37.252]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.572 --> 00:53:40.413]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:40.753 --> 00:53:42.654]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[00:53:42.974 --> 00:53:43.895]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:43.935 --> 00:53:44.135]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:44.175 --> 00:53:47.056]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:47.556 --> 00:53:49.297]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:54:17.455 --> 00:54:21.236]  Again, it doesn't matter what you think of war.
[00:54:21.336 --> 00:54:27.778]  Some of you probably feel manly when you watch CNN or Fox and see mushroom clouds, burning cities.
[00:54:28.158 --> 00:54:29.319]  Boy, America's getting them.
[00:54:29.439 --> 00:54:30.379]  America's showing them.
[00:54:30.959 --> 00:54:43.543]  The very same banking cartel using our military, our tax money, our power that we paid for and our name to invade and attack all these countries could care less about you, just like they could care less about Iraqis.
[00:54:44.003 --> 00:54:45.764]  They could care less about the Chinese people.
[00:54:46.704 --> 00:54:51.526]  The globalists pride themselves on being sadomasochistic and very ruthless.
[00:54:52.626 --> 00:54:59.849]  But remember, all of those promises, over and over and over again, in fact we'll just put it into the search engine and put a news article on screen.
[00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:06.652]  White House promises, pledges, I think that was the headline, White House pledges no ground troops in Libya.
[00:55:07.712 --> 00:55:10.514]  Their US commandos were there at the time they said that.
[00:55:11.674 --> 00:55:13.815]  They lie to you as a course of action.
[00:55:15.114 --> 00:55:16.535]  There it is, Obama, no U.S.
[00:55:16.575 --> 00:55:19.457]  forces on the ground in Libya except for those guys.
[00:55:20.158 --> 00:55:20.999]  That's NPR.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.161]  And that was a March 23rd article.
[00:55:26.002 --> 00:55:30.386]  This is the essence of just a wall of lies and deception.
[00:55:33.254 --> 00:55:40.778]  And now the EU is going to the UN for another resolution saying they're prepared to invade.
[00:55:40.798 --> 00:55:44.680]  And then there's more Orwellian lies.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:56.046]  They say, oh, it's a peace group that's going to take over the waterways and the highways, and they're going to basically demand to roll into cities for humanitarian purposes in a war they started.
[00:55:56.946 --> 00:55:57.306]  a war
[00:56:26.906 --> 00:56:32.188]  And then they tell our public, oh, we're just being humanitarian dropping bombs on them.
[00:56:32.448 --> 00:56:34.329]  There's no ground troops but the ground troops.
[00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:38.851]  And the Marine Corps commander at Lejeune goes, no, we're invading.
[00:56:38.871 --> 00:56:40.012]  We're getting on ships to go invade.
[00:56:40.032 --> 00:56:40.592]  That's the plan.
[00:56:42.813 --> 00:56:43.553]  March 2nd.
[00:56:44.414 --> 00:56:46.675]  That's a month and 17 days ago.
[00:56:48.475 --> 00:56:50.256]  A month and 17 days ago.
[00:56:50.276 --> 00:56:54.478]  That's almost six weeks ago.
[00:56:56.035 --> 00:56:58.056]  The Marines are loading on ships to ship out.
[00:56:58.276 --> 00:57:00.298]  There's other ships already there with Marines.
[00:57:00.318 --> 00:57:01.698]  2,000 of them.
[00:57:02.119 --> 00:57:04.780]  2,000 Brits on another amphibious attack craft.
[00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:08.062]  These floating amphibious invasion ships.
[00:57:10.745 --> 00:57:11.765]  They call this peace!
[00:57:12.526 --> 00:57:13.806]  This is directly out of 1984.
[00:57:13.846 --> 00:57:17.047]  And let me just read to you some of these headlines.
[00:57:17.368 --> 00:57:17.788]  Breaking!
[00:57:17.888 --> 00:57:19.928]  EU preparing to launch ground invasion in Libya.
[00:57:20.269 --> 00:57:25.871]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, Paul Watson's new key article, Pretext for War on Libya.
[00:57:26.271 --> 00:57:28.532]  Proven fraudulent by casualty figures.
[00:57:29.372 --> 00:57:35.815]  And the government of NATO, a system, even admits that the Western powers are the ones racking up the real casualties.
[00:57:36.375 --> 00:57:42.198]  And the Qaddafi didn't strafe crowds, and it was almost all lies, but he didn't run to Venezuela.
[00:57:42.218 --> 00:57:42.898]  That was lies.
[00:57:43.218 --> 00:57:44.119]  His son wasn't killed.
[00:57:44.139 --> 00:57:44.759]  That was a lie.
[00:57:45.019 --> 00:57:45.919]  They don't care.
[00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:49.961]  Here's the sun.
[00:57:50.061 --> 00:57:52.022]  Brits join ground fight in Libya.
[00:57:52.082 --> 00:57:53.983]  They've always been there since this started.
[00:57:55.538 --> 00:57:58.679]  Here's another one with my breakdown and video, InfoWars.com.
[00:57:58.739 --> 00:58:01.140]  Alex Jones on the EU ground invasion of Libya.
[00:58:02.401 --> 00:58:03.481]  Here's the LA Times.
[00:58:04.621 --> 00:58:11.644]  Yesterday, Libyan rebels' story shows links to Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and NATO.
[00:58:14.845 --> 00:58:21.748]  And then they go on to admit the main core group is Al-Qaeda and Taliban, backed by NATO from the start.
[00:58:24.195 --> 00:58:25.116]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:58:25.156 --> 00:58:26.016]  Libyan conflict.
[00:58:26.116 --> 00:58:29.638]  EU awaits UN approval for deployment of ground troops.
[00:58:30.399 --> 00:58:31.439]  But it's humanitarian.
[00:58:31.759 --> 00:58:33.100]  Yes, they're bringing in arms.
[00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:34.901]  Yes, they're advising on how to attack.
[00:58:35.181 --> 00:58:36.142]  But it's not military.
[00:58:37.363 --> 00:58:38.603]  Bombs dropping from the sky.
[00:58:38.703 --> 00:58:39.404]  Not military.
[00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:48.429]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:52.674 --> 00:58:56.295]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:58:56.635 --> 00:59:04.756]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:59:05.496 --> 00:59:09.537]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:59:10.137 --> 00:59:20.939]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:59:21.579 --> 00:59:30.581]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:31.101 --> 00:59:36.162]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:59:36.523 --> 00:59:43.684]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:59:44.004 --> 00:59:46.765]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:59:53.669 --> 00:59:55.615]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.076 --> 00:59:58.845]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.472 --> 01:00:09.675]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.315 --> 01:00:11.116]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.897 --> 01:00:12.817]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.438 --> 01:00:17.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.641 --> 01:00:21.704]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.842 --> 01:00:30.805]  Okay, we're going to have a completely jam-packed third hour coming up in T-minus 60 minutes.
[01:00:31.606 --> 01:00:34.288]  We're going to get into the ground troops that are already in Libya.
[01:00:34.648 --> 01:00:42.313]  And now the announcement by the EU, they're getting ready to send in a larger force who will attack, if you actually read the fine print, the Libyan government.
[01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.715]  If they fight back, it'll be outrageous.
[01:00:45.195 --> 01:00:48.217]  If they fight back against the bombs dropping out of the sky, it's outrageous.
[01:00:48.617 --> 01:00:52.620]  And it's going to be build terrorism and to fight back against the imperial forces.
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.322]  And then a larger invasion force will go in.
[01:00:56.382 --> 01:00:59.564]  Also, Standard & Poor's saying it looks like the U.S.
[01:00:59.584 --> 01:01:05.508]  will lose its AAA rating and that basically they're defaulting, the Treasury is, by hyperinflation.
[01:01:06.508 --> 01:01:07.709]  Also, the nanny state.
[01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:12.072]  You know, last week, Chicago's school district said no school lunches allowed.
[01:01:13.112 --> 01:01:16.054]  Parents, they said, cannot be trusted to pack lunches.
[01:01:16.894 --> 01:01:22.178]  All over the country, the Department of Education has shut down TAG, Dodgeball, Kickball,
[01:01:23.078 --> 01:01:27.482]  Capture the flag, and now even shaking hands or patting on the back.
[01:01:28.463 --> 01:01:31.346]  Now New York State, it says school will soon be out.
[01:01:32.107 --> 01:01:36.451]  If it's up to New York State Health Department, a lot of city kids might be spending their time indoors.
[01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:39.260]  And it's total bureaucracy.
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:47.724]  They're saying, you've got to do a management plan, a risk assessment, your chess club, that, you know, 50, 60, 100-year-old camp for kids.
[01:01:49.384 --> 01:01:50.385]  You're not going to canoe.
[01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:51.145]  It's too dangerous.
[01:01:51.225 --> 01:01:53.046]  You're not going to wrestle.
[01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:54.587]  You're not going to play baseball.
[01:01:55.227 --> 01:01:56.288]  I mean, you're just prisoners.
[01:01:56.668 --> 01:01:59.629]  Sit in the corner, take Prozac, worship world government.
[01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:02.610]  And this seems crazy.
[01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:05.572]  Bloomberg saying, put a tax on salt or arrest people.
[01:02:06.542 --> 01:02:09.423]  It's all about breaking your will that you're a total prisoner.
[01:02:10.263 --> 01:02:22.968]  While the big megabanks launder $376 billion, as Bloomberg itself reports, and no one gets in trouble, as they launch new wars, as they kill a million Iraqis, it's just, you are prisoners.
[01:02:23.028 --> 01:02:24.188]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:02:24.628 --> 01:02:25.789]  Kids can't climb trees.
[01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:27.509]  Gotta get rid of jungle gyms.
[01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:28.570]  Gotta get rid of slides.
[01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:29.430]  Somebody could get hurt.
[01:02:30.010 --> 01:02:31.611]  The total nanny state is here.
[01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:38.090]  But if the police taser people and they die every week from it, they're now announcing they're going to up the power of tasers.
[01:02:39.111 --> 01:02:43.836]  So, total tyranny from government, total abuse, but then if you
[01:02:45.777 --> 01:02:50.581]  engage in anything that the state says could hurt their cattle, hurt their property.
[01:02:50.821 --> 01:02:55.985]  But 300 plus thousand die from bad drug interactions, thousands conservatively from vaccine interactions.
[01:02:56.365 --> 01:02:57.666]  That's fine.
[01:02:57.706 --> 01:03:06.193]  And when the government's caught all over the world injecting school kids with syphilis, that's radiating foster children in the U.S., killing a million Iraqis.
[01:03:06.313 --> 01:03:07.434]  That is wonderful.
[01:03:07.854 --> 01:03:09.135]  That is humanitarian.
[01:03:09.936 --> 01:03:14.699]  Fukushima, 7.5 million times normal levels of radiation, Associated Press.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:18.803]  Mambiat says that's fine, on the left and on the right.
[01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:23.447]  Good old Ann Coulter says the Japanese ought to be thankful.
[01:03:24.227 --> 01:03:28.471]  So they're training us to just an unreality of where they give us crazy orders.
[01:03:28.751 --> 01:03:31.053]  You know, in the Marine Corps, that's what military training is.
[01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:37.399]  The Prussians developed modern military brainwashing, they said, to make mindless people that will follow orders, in their words.
[01:03:38.672 --> 01:03:41.933]  Shave the head, sleep deprivation, uniforms, marching.
[01:03:41.993 --> 01:03:43.473]  I mean, it is a Jim Jones system.
[01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:47.774]  And once you've been through it, you feel like you now have, first you're torn down, then you're built up.
[01:03:48.014 --> 01:03:49.614]  I know you don't want to hear this, but it is what it is.
[01:03:49.934 --> 01:03:51.254]  Prussian brainwashing.
[01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:56.756]  They would send Hessian slaves all over the world, military slaves, didn't have to be chained up, who didn't run away.
[01:03:57.356 --> 01:04:04.157]  Because they were torn down for years as children, built up as warriors, and they would just march right into gunfire like nobody else.
[01:04:05.336 --> 01:04:08.719]  And they shipped them over here to have war upon us during the Revolutionary War.
[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.401]  And so that's the system.
[01:04:12.483 --> 01:04:14.505]  And that's what the schools are, that's what everything is.
[01:04:14.765 --> 01:04:20.250]  They'll give you ridiculous orders in the Marine Corps, in the Army, and if you say, Sir, why are you giving me a dumb order?
[01:04:20.831 --> 01:04:23.333]  In the old days, they'd punch you right in the face or punch you in the stomach.
[01:04:23.354 --> 01:04:24.655]  Full Metal Jacket's very accurate.
[01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:26.937]  You don't ask me if that's a stupid thing to do!
[01:04:26.957 --> 01:04:27.778]  You do what I say!
[01:04:27.838 --> 01:04:28.418]  You don't think!
[01:04:29.139 --> 01:04:31.439]  We will have the TSA stick their hands down your pants.
[01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:33.560]  We will put sodium fluoride in your water.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:37.761]  We will not let parents pack lunches for their parents, because you're not trusted, maggot!
[01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.761]  And you will not play dodgeball.
[01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:41.421]  You will not play King of the Hill.
[01:04:41.741 --> 01:04:42.902]  You will not play kickball.
[01:04:42.942 --> 01:04:44.482]  You will not play volleyball.
[01:04:44.962 --> 01:04:45.582]  It's dangerous.
[01:04:46.122 --> 01:04:55.324]  But, if you want to join the Paramilitary Youth Corps, which they now have with the Explorer Scouts, we will train you to take on disgruntled veterans with live firearms!
[01:04:56.024 --> 01:04:58.185]  You're not allowed to be rough unless you join us!
[01:04:58.205 --> 01:05:00.186]  Then you can rough everybody else up!
[01:05:00.426 --> 01:05:00.926]  Dick Russell!
[01:05:02.047 --> 01:05:05.689]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:09.070]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:14.093]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:05:14.113 --> 01:05:20.336]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:05:20.496 --> 01:05:22.737]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:05:23.277 --> 01:05:23.557]  Tim Geithner?
[01:05:23.577 --> 01:05:23.997]  Bernanke?
[01:05:24.098 --> 01:05:24.718]  They're arsonists!
[01:05:24.758 --> 01:05:26.019]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:05:26.039 --> 01:05:28.280]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:05:42.168 --> 01:05:49.075]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:05:49.455 --> 01:05:58.564]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:06:00.526 --> 01:06:04.749]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:05.669]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:09.132]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:09.972]  Number 2.
[01:06:10.273 --> 01:06:14.816]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.156 --> 01:06:15.596]  It's true.
[01:06:15.896 --> 01:06:20.459]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:21.320]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.882]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:28.885]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:29.645]  Number four.
[01:06:29.885 --> 01:06:32.246]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.646 --> 01:06:36.027]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.327 --> 01:06:36.867]  Number five.
[01:06:37.107 --> 01:06:41.028]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.248 --> 01:06:46.030]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:50.331]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.491 --> 01:06:52.052]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.272 --> 01:06:56.873]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:00.374 --> 01:07:01.514]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:07:01.554 --> 01:07:08.217]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:08.477 --> 01:07:10.757]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:11.018 --> 01:07:16.219]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:19.180]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.501]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:21.761 --> 01:07:27.684]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:28.005 --> 01:07:31.206]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:31.387 --> 01:07:36.910]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:38.471]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:40.032]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:40.112 --> 01:07:42.653]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:42.773 --> 01:07:44.194]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:07:44.454 --> 01:07:46.816]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:51.499]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:54.081]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:07:54.202 --> 01:07:57.924]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:07:58.085 --> 01:07:59.826]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:08:00.947 --> 01:08:05.871]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:06.211 --> 01:08:08.493]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.318 --> 01:08:36.541]  My friends, we don't normally cover Little Green Men here on the broadcast, but when it's in the London Guardian, when it's in USA Today, AOL News, headlines, 10 days before JFK was killed in 63, he requested the MJ-12 documents.
[01:08:36.621 --> 01:08:48.244]  Now we know he did write a letter requesting, and we know that part's true, the FBI is now declassifying a lot of this stuff, but we don't know if the MJ-12 is real, but one of the leading JFK
[01:08:49.344 --> 01:08:50.845]  Researchers is Dick Russell.
[01:08:50.885 --> 01:08:52.025]  He's a best-selling author.
[01:08:52.426 --> 01:08:54.147]  Really needs no introduction.
[01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:55.427]  DickRussell.org.
[01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:59.389]  And he has co-authored many of Jesse Ventura's latest best-selling books.
[01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.210]  I think it's his best book yet.
[01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:02.231]  63 documents.
[01:09:02.651 --> 01:09:04.152]  The government doesn't want you to read.
[01:09:04.572 --> 01:09:05.773]  A total page-turner.
[01:09:05.793 --> 01:09:07.274]  You want to wake somebody up, this is it.
[01:09:07.734 --> 01:09:10.415]  We're going to walk through the 9-11 stand-down order.
[01:09:10.435 --> 01:09:12.977]  We're going to walk through government drug-dealing documents.
[01:09:13.777 --> 01:09:14.637]  We're going to talk about it all.
[01:09:14.997 --> 01:09:30.161]  And one document that I think bears inspection, I don't think it's bad it's in there, I just think it doesn't compare to the rest, the Koch brothers, you know, that George Soros is so obsessed with, you know, meeting with other conservatives to try to organize, you know, a free market system.
[01:09:30.461 --> 01:09:32.262]  I don't know why folks are so scared of the Koch brothers.
[01:09:33.762 --> 01:09:43.208]  I mean, I don't like the mainline Republicans that are always warmongering and telling us about the Bill of Rights and Constitution when they love torture and secret arrest, but Obama's continuing all that as well.
[01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:49.913]  But I want to get Dick Russell, because he's a studied hand at history, his view on the incredible
[01:09:51.195 --> 01:10:05.680]  It's incredible because we knew it was coming, and it's incredible because it's so naked and brazen and Orwellian that they, before the war against Gaddafi began, whether you love him or hate him, the point is, he made deals with the West and got double-crossed, just like Mubarak in Egypt.
[01:10:06.451 --> 01:10:08.312]  That they're using Al Qaeda against them.
[01:10:08.332 --> 01:10:08.972]  That's the core.
[01:10:09.012 --> 01:10:10.533]  That's in the LA Times yesterday.
[01:10:10.553 --> 01:10:12.373]  Again, we told you a month ago.
[01:10:13.174 --> 01:10:19.556]  But there's this new system where rebels attack the government in the Ivory Coast with machetes, killing men, women, and children.
[01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:23.518]  The French invade, come in, take over the president, throw him out, put him in.
[01:10:24.738 --> 01:10:26.319]  Same stuff going on in Egypt.
[01:10:26.379 --> 01:10:28.219]  Same stuff going on in Libya.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.261]  And they said, Obama said, we will never have ground troops.
[01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:31.741]  Period.
[01:10:32.469 --> 01:10:32.729]  There.
[01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:40.512]  Even NPR admitted at the time he said that on March 23rd of last month, there were already U.S.
[01:10:40.532 --> 01:10:44.653]  Special Forces and advisors lazing bombing targets on the ground.
[01:10:45.234 --> 01:10:51.296]  And they said, well, that's not combat, to have Special Forces lazing targets for bombs and missiles and cruise missiles.
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:11:05.050]  Now, the UN has said, and the EU has said they're going with a resolution to put more ground troops in who are humanitarian to organize the cadres and to launch them and to arm them, and that that's not military.
[01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:07.913]  So bombing's not military, it's kinetic action.
[01:11:08.473 --> 01:11:11.255]  I mean, regardless of what you think about this, they lie to you.
[01:11:11.575 --> 01:11:21.241]  Here's a clip of Obama in what, specifically the 22nd of March, NPR reported on the 23rd, telling people there will be no ground troops.
[01:11:21.321 --> 01:11:24.143]  Now, there were already ground troops there when he said this.
[01:11:24.183 --> 01:11:25.383]  The Marines are off the coast.
[01:11:25.884 --> 01:11:26.924]  More Marines are coming.
[01:11:27.345 --> 01:11:27.785]  It's on.
[01:11:28.445 --> 01:11:30.327]  And as our troops fight and die there,
[01:11:31.267 --> 01:11:40.173]  I guess, just like Vietnam was a secret war from 60 to 64, with just advisors, they're going to say, well those aren't deaths, those are kinetic actions.
[01:11:40.673 --> 01:11:43.135]  So, a new level of deception.
[01:11:43.435 --> 01:11:44.036]  Here's the clip.
[01:11:44.676 --> 01:11:56.784]  Today, I authorize the Armed Forces of the United States to begin a limited military action in Libya, in support of an international effort to protect Libyan civilians.
[01:11:57.725 --> 01:11:59.186]  That action has now begun.
[01:12:00.237 --> 01:12:05.079]  Actions have consequences, and the writ of the international community must be enforced.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:07.880]  That is the cause of this coalition.
[01:12:09.001 --> 01:12:22.687]  As a part of this effort, the United States will contribute our unique capabilities at the front end of the mission to protect Libyan civilians and enable the enforcement of a no-fly zone that will be led by our international partners.
[01:12:23.595 --> 01:12:28.898]  And as I said yesterday, we will not, I repeat, we will not deploy any U.S.
[01:12:28.938 --> 01:12:29.919]  troops on the ground.
[01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:33.280]  Okay, at the time, there were U.S.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:39.744]  Special Forces and CIA, and now the Marines, even before that, said they're preparing to invade.
[01:12:40.164 --> 01:12:45.387]  Dick Russell, I mean, is it just me, or is stuff getting more and more obviously deceptive?
[01:12:45.467 --> 01:12:46.768]  Why are they so brazen?
[01:12:47.859 --> 01:12:55.945]  Well, you know, I mean, it sounds to me like a classic case of double speak, and I mean, the Libyan situation is a tough one, admittedly.
[01:12:56.005 --> 01:13:04.952]  I mean, you know, you don't want Qaddafi killing hundreds of thousands of people, which it looked like, according to what the news was showing us anyway in the beginning, was going to happen.
[01:13:05.832 --> 01:13:07.854]  In the cities that the rebels have taken.
[01:13:07.914 --> 01:13:14.138]  But now, I mean, we're already involved in, we're trying to get out of Iraq, which I'm sure we're not completely.
[01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:16.079]  Afghanistan, we're still mired down.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:33.011]  If we start sending ground troops into Libya, I mean, at a time when the budget deficit is already insane and the military spending is what's really responsible for so much of this, I just think it's crazy and we're not being leveled with about it.
[01:13:33.663 --> 01:13:34.083]  That's right.
[01:13:34.103 --> 01:13:45.105]  We're hearing no Republicans except for Rand Paul and Ron Paul talk about making cuts to the military when it's 1.1 trillion on budget, 800 plus billion supplemental.
[01:13:45.226 --> 01:13:47.246]  That's just shy of 2 trillion.
[01:13:47.926 --> 01:13:49.907]  And we're hearing nothing about that.
[01:13:50.007 --> 01:13:51.467]  Nothing about banker bailouts.
[01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.887]  All we're hearing about is welfare queens.
[01:13:54.368 --> 01:14:00.829]  You could send all the welfare queens to Mars and it wouldn't put a scratch on this debt.
[01:14:01.573 --> 01:14:16.065]  Yeah, I mean, it's totally insane what we're being told, and, you know, the Republicans won't talk about it because, you know, they're being funded by the big banks, and all the people that we've just realized have just been seeing this week are not paying any taxes.
[01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:18.287]  Wow!
[01:14:33.337 --> 01:14:38.922]  Wow, you just hit it on the head and suddenly I'm hearing liberals and conservatives and libertarians get it right.
[01:14:39.762 --> 01:14:44.346]  The left was always, raise taxes on the rich, $125,000 or more.
[01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:45.186]  That's not the rich.
[01:14:45.667 --> 01:14:47.909]  And Republicans were always, leave all the rich alone.
[01:14:48.309 --> 01:14:52.913]  Finally, I'm hearing Republicans go, wow, there's these offshore corporations that wrote the loopholes.
[01:14:53.753 --> 01:15:11.389]  And they get out of almost all the taxes, in some cases all of them, and then it turns out the Federal Reserve and others, they're actually lobbying to raise taxes on the middle class, posing as Obamanoid liberals, and if people just figure out that slightly sophisticated deception, game over.
[01:15:12.182 --> 01:15:26.511]  Yeah, and now, of course, people are starting to be very concerned because of what you mentioned briefly earlier, that Standard & Poor's has suddenly, you know, sent the American credit rating, you know, devalued us, and so the stock market's going down.
[01:15:26.551 --> 01:15:30.474]  I mean, people are justifiably scared of where this economy's going.
[01:15:31.154 --> 01:15:38.279]  And, you know, the fact is that the rich are still getting richer and the big banks that got bailed out are making more money than they ever did.
[01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:49.506]  There's a new book out, I haven't read it yet, but on Goldman Sachs that shows, you know, how they basically are one of the big controllers of... I mean, we're being run by these... we're a corporate oligarchy.
[01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:50.847]  That's what's happened to us in America.
[01:15:51.886 --> 01:15:54.707]  Absolutely, but the corporate oligarchy is sophisticated.
[01:15:54.747 --> 01:16:09.151]  They pose as the left and the right, and they play the blue-collar off against the middle class, because a blue-collar guy busting his hind end and repairing cars all day, they think of somebody making a million bucks as rich, or a hundred thousand as rich.
[01:16:09.672 --> 01:16:16.954]  The truth is, it's that middle class that actually funds the economy, and the true billionaires, to a man, they're almost completely tax-exempt.
[01:16:16.974 --> 01:16:20.595]  I mean, Warren Buffett admits he pays about eight percent in tax,
[01:16:21.215 --> 01:16:25.136]  Meanwhile, the CPAs are controlled by the IRS now.
[01:16:25.236 --> 01:16:34.139]  It costs $431 billion a year just to pay the CPAs, or roughly 30% of the tax revenue, and it turns out they're kept creatures.
[01:16:34.479 --> 01:16:46.423]  So somebody like Jesse Ventura, Dick Russell, Ron Paul, Alex Jones, people who are really middle class, or upper middle class, folks like Jesse Ventura, I've talked to Ventura, he's paying something like 40-something percent.
[01:16:46.663 --> 01:16:50.144]  The real tax rate isn't 35, because they've gotten rid of most of the write-offs.
[01:16:50.464 --> 01:16:51.165]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:54.147]  I mean, it's, well, it's out of whack.
[01:16:54.347 --> 01:16:55.248]  Completely out of whack.
[01:16:55.268 --> 01:16:58.871]  You mentioned the Koch brothers earlier, and you're not too worried about them, Alex, but I am.
[01:16:58.911 --> 01:17:08.038]  And, you know, the fact is that they're, you wonder who's out there that the Koch brothers, nobody knew anything about them until the New Yorker did this profile almost a year ago now.
[01:17:08.078 --> 01:17:14.043]  And here are these guys, some of the richest people in the world who basically, I mean, they have funded the Tea Party.
[01:17:14.543 --> 01:17:22.449]  They have set up these so-called non-profits that are paying scientists to debunk the fact that the climate is changing.
[01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:30.496]  These guys are dangerous and I'm sure there's a lot more that we have no idea who they are that are really calling the shot.
[01:17:32.435 --> 01:17:37.820]  Well, I'm not saying that the Koch brothers are perfect angels.
[01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:51.712]  I mean, I read the documents in your book that were gotten by Soros Outfit, a Soros website, a Soros-funded site, and it's about liberty and freedom and free market and how do we restore the republic.
[01:17:52.073 --> 01:17:55.095]  Sounds great, but then a lot of the speakers that they have there
[01:17:56.132 --> 01:17:57.713]  Some of them I like, like Peter Schiff.
[01:17:58.093 --> 01:18:01.175]  It's not like it's even a secret meeting, it's just a private meeting, a conference.
[01:18:02.756 --> 01:18:04.237]  Some of them are good, some of them are bad.
[01:18:04.697 --> 01:18:12.542]  But the point is, is that sure, you don't hear the Republicans of this group against the torture, most of them the wars.
[01:18:12.622 --> 01:18:15.885]  So they like to talk a liberty game, but they're not actually involved in it.
[01:18:15.925 --> 01:18:22.689]  But the Koch brothers and their amount of spending, compared to George Soros, I mean, are you concerned about George Soros?
[01:18:23.663 --> 01:18:24.483]  You know, I don't know.
[01:18:24.504 --> 01:18:25.624]  I mean, he's got a lot of money.
[01:18:26.104 --> 01:18:30.667]  I'm more of a liberal Democrat than anything else.
[01:18:30.727 --> 01:18:38.051]  And I, you know, I mean, not everything Soros does is... I haven't followed him that closely, but the Koch brothers worry me.
[01:18:38.091 --> 01:18:43.435]  They're far-right people that it seems to me are not doing our democracy any good.
[01:18:43.715 --> 01:18:45.416]  Well, tell me about them then.
[01:18:45.436 --> 01:18:48.317]  Let's go over some of the documents in the book.
[01:18:48.358 --> 01:18:50.619]  Let's start covering the Koch brothers.
[01:18:51.411 --> 01:18:58.275]  Well, the documents that we put in the book for the Koch brothers is basically just a story of this.
[01:18:59.015 --> 01:19:05.758]  They have this every year, and the one this year, I think, was in Rancho Mirage, California, was picketed by a lot of people.
[01:19:05.838 --> 01:19:15.724]  I mean, they bring together a lot of the rich and powerful, and they talk about their plan to basically, you know, let's take over the country.
[01:19:16.924 --> 01:19:21.608]  Let's get our agenda through, and they'll do it in any way that they can.
[01:19:21.628 --> 01:19:25.170]  I mean, well, they have people like Glenn Beck, and I'm not a big Glenn Beck fan.
[01:19:25.190 --> 01:19:27.712]  I mean, I think the guys, well, even Fox let him go.
[01:19:27.812 --> 01:19:35.738]  So, you know, they've been under the radar for a long time, setting up, as I say, these non-profit organizations to
[01:19:36.859 --> 01:19:38.881]  We're good to go.
[01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.858]  If you suffer from poor sleep, you need MyPillow.

[01:21:00.674 --> 01:21:02.214]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:02.474 --> 01:21:17.978]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[01:21:18.038 --> 01:21:18.338]  dollar.
[01:21:18.378 --> 01:21:28.041]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the U.S.
[01:21:28.101 --> 01:21:29.041]  economy and inflation.
[01:21:29.281 --> 01:21:39.074]  I urge you to sign up at the NIA's free newsletter at www.inflation.us to learn how you can not only survive, but prosper during the upcoming hyperinflation crisis.
[01:21:39.374 --> 01:21:44.981]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.

[01:22:00.555 --> 01:22:03.077]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as 1-2-3.

[01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:31.235]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.395 --> 01:22:35.778]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.978 --> 01:22:41.682]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.782 --> 01:22:45.184]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[01:23:47.233 --> 01:23:48.514]  Day after day, alone on a hill
[01:24:12.433 --> 01:24:25.178]  Okay, look, I love Dick Russell's research into JFK, the 9-11 information, and I'm not here trying to beat him up on air.
[01:24:25.438 --> 01:24:29.740]  I just like to have an honest debate, because I'm not funded by the Koch brothers.
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:39.765]  I'm funded by my listeners, my sponsors, and I see General Electric getting waivers to build new plants and not upgrade to clean burning with their other plants.
[01:24:40.856 --> 01:24:41.997]  I see him building in China.
[01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:45.699]  The head of GE is the head of his economic council.
[01:24:46.039 --> 01:24:58.288]  Day one, when the new EPA regulations went in that Congress didn't pass, he gave a waiver to General Electric, while the head of the Energy Department says they're going to shut down hundreds of other plants that aren't part of the inside group.
[01:24:58.308 --> 01:25:02.690]  It's like Obama's people giving waivers to a thousand-plus groups like McDonald's.
[01:25:02.991 --> 01:25:06.133]  They don't have to get government health care, but
[01:25:06.713 --> 01:25:07.734]  Paying Al Gore a tax?
[01:25:07.774 --> 01:25:07.974]  You mean?
[01:25:29.531 --> 01:25:42.364]  Okay, well, you know, I want to just... In the book, 53 Documents the Government Doesn't Want You to Read, the one document on climate change that I found very telling was a military study that was done in 2006.
[01:25:42.964 --> 01:25:43.925]  Didn't get much attention.
[01:25:43.985 --> 01:25:45.627]  The Center for Navy Analysis did it.
[01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:51.491]  I'm not a big backer of a lot of things that the military comes out with in this country, but in this case I think they're telling the truth.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.762]  And, you know, of course, at the same time, you've got all these big polluting industries that are getting off the hook.
[01:26:11.823 --> 01:26:16.905]  I mean, the Obama administration is still allowing offshore oil drilling to start up again in the Gulf.
[01:26:16.945 --> 01:26:24.407]  Now, of course, that kind of pressure is coming from these, you know, mega oil and gas corporations backing clean coal technology.
[01:26:24.448 --> 01:26:30.130]  I mean, that's obviously only going to benefit the big coal companies like Peabody and others.
[01:26:30.210 --> 01:26:32.011]  And, you know, that's crazy.
[01:26:33.711 --> 01:26:34.612]  I think?
[01:26:51.604 --> 01:27:01.746]  Well, Dick, just to briefly interrupt, I'm all for people putting in their own wind, their own solar, but I can't get a tax break by the county, the state, or the feds to put in my own solar.
[01:27:01.886 --> 01:27:05.767]  I've got to put it in and then share it with the grid and not use my own power.
[01:27:05.807 --> 01:27:13.989]  They want me under their control and that's my problem is that so many of these green initiatives are just payoff to insider cronies.
[01:27:14.616 --> 01:27:19.579]  Well, that's true, and you should be able to get a tax break for that, and it should, you know, this should be mandated.
[01:27:19.839 --> 01:27:25.682]  And, you know, it's crazy that people have to stay as part of this grid system if they don't want to be.
[01:27:25.702 --> 01:27:30.725]  They should be able to, I mean, you know, millions of people would go forward with this if they had the opportunity.
[01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:31.785]  So I'm right with you on that.
[01:27:32.906 --> 01:27:35.127]  But Obama, he wants to be part of the grid.
[01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:40.170]  I mean, what about General Electric getting waivers, but then their competition doesn't?
[01:27:40.868 --> 01:27:41.248]  Well, yeah.
[01:27:41.368 --> 01:27:45.309]  I mean, obviously they've got friends in high places that they're paying a lot of money to.
[01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:54.753]  And, you know, we know the political system is completely beholden to these big corporations and people with a ton of money.
[01:27:54.773 --> 01:27:57.793]  I mean, who was the biggest contributor to Obama in the 2008 election?
[01:27:57.813 --> 01:27:58.634]  It was Goldman Sachs.
[01:27:59.694 --> 01:28:10.358]  By the way, Goldman Sachs, one of the biggest funders of climate change initiatives.
[01:28:11.018 --> 01:28:12.279]  BP, one of the biggest.
[01:28:12.619 --> 01:28:16.140]  I mean, you know, the oil companies aren't just one monolithic group.
[01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.782]  No, no, they're not, of course.
[01:28:18.002 --> 01:28:20.825]  And, yeah, Goldman Sachs, I've read about that.
[01:28:20.865 --> 01:28:26.531]  It's been looking for ways to profit from certain areas of this whole climate change.
[01:28:26.591 --> 01:28:29.435]  Well, it was Ken Lay came up with the whole carbon tax idea.
[01:28:30.556 --> 01:28:30.816]  Was it?
[01:28:31.177 --> 01:28:32.018]  I'm not aware of that, yeah.
[01:28:32.918 --> 01:28:36.920]  I mean, look, I'm not saying, Dick, my concern is genetic engineering.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:46.705]  I mean, they've got thousands of different open air animals, plants, that are multiple species, openly giving rise to super viruses, bacteria.
[01:28:46.965 --> 01:28:50.787]  Don't get me wrong, I just think worrying about carbon dioxide is a red herring.
[01:28:51.533 --> 01:29:03.547]  Well, I don't think so, but with you I am totally, you know, I mean this whole genetic engineering, the Monsanto world and the way that they screw over the organic farming
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:05.261]  We're good to go.
[01:29:23.184 --> 01:29:30.987]  That I put together with Governor Ventura this book of 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read is because people have got to wake up.
[01:29:31.027 --> 01:29:37.969]  They've got to realize, number one, there's an awful lot going on today that you may have no idea about because it's not in the mainstream media.
[01:29:38.009 --> 01:29:38.870]  Nick Russell, stay there.
[01:29:38.890 --> 01:29:40.050]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[01:29:40.070 --> 01:29:43.812]  We're going to get into the book and the 63 documents they don't want you to read on the other side.
[01:29:43.832 --> 01:29:45.712]  The book's available at InfoWars.com.
[01:29:45.772 --> 01:29:47.313]  Listeners, excellent information.
[01:29:51.075 --> 01:29:51.976]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.456 --> 01:29:54.057]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.997 --> 01:29:57.759]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:07.704]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:30:07.984 --> 01:30:10.345]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:12.827]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with eFoods Direct.
[01:30:13.067 --> 01:30:17.249]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:30:17.449 --> 01:30:18.930]  You must act automatically.
[01:30:19.150 --> 01:30:22.333]  What does the pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:30:22.653 --> 01:30:25.116]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:30:25.416 --> 01:30:33.404]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:30:33.784 --> 01:30:36.567]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:30:36.807 --> 01:30:46.477]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:05.601]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:09.623]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.684 --> 01:31:12.105]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:17.569]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:31:17.989 --> 01:31:24.234]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.654 --> 01:31:30.199]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.639 --> 01:31:34.322]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.802 --> 01:31:38.826]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.106 --> 01:31:44.610]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.051 --> 01:31:47.973]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.614 --> 01:31:50.035]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.575 --> 01:31:51.016]  It's here.

[01:32:07.479 --> 01:32:12.240]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:32:12.621 --> 01:32:19.322]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:21.343 --> 01:32:27.795]  They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[01:32:29.841 --> 01:32:33.702]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:34.422 --> 01:32:37.543]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:32:38.263 --> 01:32:39.103]  Others don't.
[01:32:39.503 --> 01:32:41.384]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:41.644 --> 01:32:43.144]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:43.424 --> 01:32:45.985]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:32:55.647 --> 01:32:57.668]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[01:32:58.008 --> 01:32:58.868]  Others don't.
[01:33:09.423 --> 01:33:15.704]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:18.445 --> 01:33:23.306]  Okay, in the next hour, all over the country, they're following Chicago's move.
[01:33:23.746 --> 01:33:28.687]  Parents, you're prisoners, you can't make school lunch for your prisoner children.
[01:33:30.249 --> 01:33:36.880]  Also, the state's coming in, not just at public schools now, but they're telling private camps, you're not playing softball.
[01:33:37.201 --> 01:33:38.223]  You're not playing tag.
[01:33:38.363 --> 01:33:39.064]  You're prisoners.
[01:33:39.825 --> 01:33:41.107]  But it's because we care about you.
[01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:48.574]  We've got a video coming out tomorrow that we've done a lot of research on that's going to blow you away at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:48.594 --> 01:33:49.535]  It's going to break that down.
[01:33:50.075 --> 01:33:52.616]  Now, again, Dick Russell, I read his books years ago.
[01:33:52.637 --> 01:33:54.318]  He doesn't really toot his horn.
[01:33:54.618 --> 01:33:57.900]  He's one of the preeminent researchers into JFK.
[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:04.844]  And we're also going to, if we talk about the book, get into this amazing AP, Reuters, Daily Mail headlines.
[01:34:05.444 --> 01:34:09.187]  JFK, 10 days before he was killed, demanded files on aliens.
[01:34:09.707 --> 01:34:14.528]  And the FBI's released this stuff, and I don't cover aliens, but except when it's out in the open.
[01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:16.769]  Is this part of some weird psy-op?
[01:34:16.789 --> 01:34:19.890]  We'll get Dick Russell's take on that coming up in the last segment.
[01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:21.551]  But now let's get into the book.
[01:34:21.591 --> 01:34:28.953]  I just want to point out to listeners, you support Jesse, you support alternative media, Dick Russell, and the work that they're doing.
[01:34:29.413 --> 01:34:35.295]  The book American Conspiracy was powerful, so was Don't Start the Revolution Without Me, co-authored with Dick Russell.
[01:34:36.158 --> 01:34:38.998]  But this new one really gets people thinking.
[01:34:39.359 --> 01:34:44.739]  And, you know, of the 63, there's one or two documents that I don't 100% agree with the perspective on.
[01:34:44.759 --> 01:34:45.500]  But that doesn't matter.
[01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:46.820]  It's all about knowledge.
[01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.420]  But it's a very bold book to be put out by somebody like Jesse Ventura.
[01:34:50.460 --> 01:35:00.162]  I mean, they've got the 9-11 stand-down order, the government drug dealing, the torture, shady White House, 9-11, government, military, corporate secrets, our scandalous post-war history.
[01:35:01.402 --> 01:35:02.423]  It's just got it all.
[01:35:02.723 --> 01:35:04.743]  And it's the type of book that when I got it a month ago,
[01:35:05.143 --> 01:35:08.506]  Before it came out, I couldn't start shipping them yet because we sell them at Infowars.com.
[01:35:08.526 --> 01:35:13.031]  I had to wait until it officially kicked off in early April.
[01:35:13.071 --> 01:35:15.834]  But again, you can get it at Infowars.com.
[01:35:16.234 --> 01:35:19.758]  The War on Terror, you can't put it down because it's the documents.
[01:35:19.878 --> 01:35:23.962]  And then it's the comments and the research on it with the graphics, the photos.
[01:35:26.164 --> 01:35:27.885]  Really down my alley.
[01:35:27.905 --> 01:35:28.866]  This is right up my alley.
[01:35:29.186 --> 01:35:31.887]  A great way to wake up skeptics, because the proof is there.
[01:35:32.267 --> 01:35:33.708]  Every document in here is admitted.
[01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:35.809]  And I'm going to give Dick Russell the floor here in a moment.
[01:35:36.210 --> 01:35:45.655]  But if you want to support the alternative media and what we're doing, and get a book that will inform you to a higher level that you can pay forward and give to others, you can get the book discounted at InfoWars.com.
[01:35:46.515 --> 01:35:53.119]  And you can also get with it discounted the new book that's only available at InfoWars.com by Mark Dice.
[01:35:54.039 --> 01:35:56.103]  Title, Big Brother the Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:35:56.464 --> 01:36:05.722]  Paralleling 1984 that we know is a vision of a tyranny by somebody that witnessed it via the Soviets and the British and the Nazis, Eric Blair, aka George Orwell.
[01:36:06.874 --> 01:36:09.996]  With what's now currently been put into place, and then what's coming in the future.
[01:36:10.177 --> 01:36:11.097]  Very powerful book.
[01:36:11.437 --> 01:36:17.142]  When you get both books together, you can get one of my best-selling films of your choice, Obama Deception, Endgame, Fall of the Republic.

[01:36:23.527 --> 01:36:26.329]  Also, we're not going to print any more of these.
[01:36:26.389 --> 01:36:27.490]  When they're gone, they're gone.
[01:36:28.576 --> 01:36:29.678]  Uh, it's a limited edition.
[01:36:29.839 --> 01:36:30.660]  V for Victory.

[01:36:33.304 --> 01:36:35.468]  But I said it's a limited edition, so I follow my word.
[01:36:35.808 --> 01:36:37.652]  If you want it, we still got it in in all sizes.
[01:36:38.052 --> 01:36:39.234]  Also, the draft Ron Paul 2012.
[01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:42.556]  He's gonna pretty much be announced in the next few weeks.
[01:36:43.156 --> 01:36:46.099]  As soon as he announces, we'll sell out of what we got and that's it.

[01:37:07.073 --> 01:37:09.934]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[01:37:10.154 --> 01:37:14.656]  And we're also streaming live video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:37:14.976 --> 01:37:18.417]  Going back to Dick Russell, co-author of 63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[01:37:18.697 --> 01:37:19.638]  DickRussell.org.
[01:37:19.978 --> 01:37:20.938]  Dick, you've got the floor.
[01:37:20.998 --> 01:37:25.960]  Break down the book, why you wrote it, what you think is the most powerful info in the book.
[01:37:26.997 --> 01:37:29.699]  Yeah, thanks, Alex, and thanks for your kind words about it.
[01:37:29.719 --> 01:37:37.925]  I mean, we started thinking about doing a book like this long before WikiLeaks happened, which was, of course, about four or five months ago.
[01:37:38.365 --> 01:37:41.347]  And the big thing is the tremendous secrecy in our government.
[01:37:41.367 --> 01:37:49.553]  I mean, there are, I don't know if people know this, but there are 16 million documents being classified top secret by our government every single year.
[01:37:50.365 --> 01:37:50.766]  I don't know.
[01:38:05.527 --> 01:38:08.510]  Crazy what's being kept from us.
[01:38:08.530 --> 01:38:16.496]  What Jesse Ventura and I did with this book was to go through the, this is all public domain material.
[01:38:16.816 --> 01:38:24.543]  In other words, we're not reprinting except for the WikiLeaks documents that are in the book, and there are some of those documents that are, you know,
[01:38:25.223 --> 01:38:26.564]  We stole from the government or something.
[01:38:26.604 --> 01:38:27.084]  I mean, we didn't.
[01:38:28.125 --> 01:38:29.125]  But it's all online.
[01:38:29.145 --> 01:38:43.193]  But when you put it together, when you put the picture together of what began happening with the CIA after World War II, there's documents in here from the mind control programs, Artichoke and MKUltra.
[01:38:44.133 --> 01:38:46.475]  Documents about bringing the Nazis over.
[01:38:46.575 --> 01:38:58.201]  I think I call it a pact with the devil, really, to work with bringing their, not just their rocket scientists, but their people who have been involved in germ warfare, a lot of these kinds of things, over to this country right after World War II.
[01:38:58.261 --> 01:39:11.809]  And if you look at the CIA's assassination manual that was drawn up in the mid-50s, you start to see the roots of what happened to the country increasingly through the assassination of President Kennedy and the other great leaders of the 60s.
[01:39:12.849 --> 01:39:18.551]  And then, you know, on up through the Reagan years and the Bush years and 9-11.
[01:39:18.671 --> 01:39:21.471]  And not all the book is historical.
[01:39:21.631 --> 01:39:30.454]  I mean, there's a lot of early documents that show the roots of what's happened to the country, but then a lot of it is about what's going on today.
[01:39:32.173 --> 01:39:35.156]  Today being the things that you mentioned earlier.
[01:39:35.176 --> 01:39:45.385]  I mean, what's the origins of the civil disturbance plan for this country to possibly impose martial law if it became, quote, necessary because of terrorism?
[01:39:46.166 --> 01:39:52.972]  The emergency detention camps and the civilian inmate labor program that exists.
[01:39:53.032 --> 01:39:57.055]  These are real things, and the documents behind them are in the book.
[01:39:58.334 --> 01:40:15.389]  The synthetic biological agents that the military was looking at way back in 1969 and talking about in congressional hearings that could have led to things like the creation of Lyme disease or even AIDS in laboratories.
[01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:19.432]  The testing that's being done on our own troops.
[01:40:21.314 --> 01:40:22.275]  Gulf War syndrome.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:26.121]  A quarter of a million veterans affected by Gulf War Syndrome.
[01:40:27.622 --> 01:40:29.323]  The government, they've known about this.
[01:40:29.383 --> 01:40:34.645]  They knew what these kind of chemicals were going to do and yet this has gone on.
[01:40:35.466 --> 01:40:39.848]  The book covers, I don't know how many documents are in it, well it's 63 of course.
[01:40:39.968 --> 01:40:48.272]  And we chose the title 63 because that was the year that John F. Kennedy was assassinated and things really began to change.
[01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:49.212]  We're good.
[01:41:13.191 --> 01:41:18.675]  And that's common sense for anyone that studied modern civilization, ancient civilization.
[01:41:19.276 --> 01:41:31.605]  We know the path we've gone down, and now we're very deep into it, is classical tyranny and the most vicious, oppressive, ruthless, Orwellian version I've ever seen.
[01:41:32.506 --> 01:41:35.608]  And people like Obama, Bush, these are just front puppets.
[01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:40.112]  This private, corporate oligarchy that you talked about
[01:41:41.513 --> 01:41:44.236]  Their endgame, Dick, is population reduction.
[01:41:45.477 --> 01:41:58.070]  And I know your book gets some into the secret experimentation, but going back to one of the issues that you mentioned earlier on, and that was all these Nazi scientists brought over here to places like Plum Island.
[01:41:58.581 --> 01:42:00.442]  Yeah, that's absolutely true.
[01:42:00.582 --> 01:42:03.203]  And Plum Island was created by a Nazi scientist.
[01:42:03.224 --> 01:42:10.207]  Plum Island is this little island that the top secret Pentagon experiment is going on off the coast of Lyme, Connecticut.
[01:42:10.447 --> 01:42:21.433]  And in the paperback of American Conspiracies, which just came out, there's a new chapter about the likelihood that Lyme disease was in fact created on Plum Island.
[01:42:21.533 --> 01:42:24.575]  And Jesse Ventura did one of his TV shows, Conspiracy Theory, about that.
[01:42:24.835 --> 01:42:26.515]  And it showed up in Lyme, Connecticut.
[01:42:27.376 --> 01:42:29.516]  And now they've got Morgellons.
[01:42:30.397 --> 01:42:34.218]  And certainly a lot of the folks that think they have it are paranoid schizophrenics.
[01:42:34.278 --> 01:42:36.858]  But now we have the University of Michigan.
[01:42:36.898 --> 01:42:41.940]  Researchers inject nanofiber spears carrying cells into wounds to grow tissue.
[01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:51.462]  And then you look at this and it looks exactly like basically what the scientists and medical doctors that have looked and removed this Morgellons stuff.
[01:42:51.762 --> 01:42:53.403]  It looks like that's exactly what this is.
[01:42:54.278 --> 01:42:57.480]  You know, I've read a little about that, and it's scary as hell, what I've read.
[01:42:57.540 --> 01:43:00.383]  So I would like to look into that further myself.
[01:43:00.423 --> 01:43:02.284]  And, yeah, it's terrifying.
[01:43:02.304 --> 01:43:10.710]  Well, the point is, what you prove in the book, people always say, well, if 1% of what Alex Jones says is true, we're in deep trouble.
[01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:11.951]  Try 98%, folks.
[01:43:11.971 --> 01:43:12.892]  We do our research here.
[01:43:12.932 --> 01:43:15.374]  Sometimes we make mistakes, and we come back and correct them.
[01:43:15.814 --> 01:43:18.997]  But, I mean, your book, this is all admitted stuff going on here.
[01:43:19.617 --> 01:43:24.762]  And it just shows that they have gotten away with murder, and now the system is emboldened.
[01:43:25.543 --> 01:43:32.289]  When you talked about this global corporate fascist oligarchy, who do you see at the head of this New World Order from your decades of research?
[01:43:32.730 --> 01:43:34.552]  And what do you think their endgame is, Dick Russell?
[01:43:35.731 --> 01:43:42.556]  You know, I don't think we know who the real powers that be are that are at the bottom or at the top.
[01:43:42.596 --> 01:43:53.283]  I mean, you know, we know of certain well-known people who have billions of dollars, but I don't think the real guys are going to come out and let themselves be exposed.
[01:43:53.323 --> 01:43:59.547]  Now, that could be the whole, you know, Bohemian Grove idea of those people that meet there secretly.
[01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:04.510]  And the endgame, you know, the top 1% survive no matter what.
[01:44:04.630 --> 01:44:04.870]  I mean...
[01:44:05.911 --> 01:44:07.432]  That's what it's looking like to me.
[01:44:07.753 --> 01:44:09.894]  And, you know, they will stop at nothing.
[01:44:10.214 --> 01:44:30.090]  And in the book, there's a section on 9-11, which I would like to touch on a little bit, starting with the big think tank, the Project for a New American Century, anticipating 9-11 not too long before it happens, saying, you know, what's really needed to advance the agenda of, which was then the Bush administration.
[01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:31.691]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:44:53.333 --> 01:44:54.454]  We're good to go.
[01:45:09.151 --> 01:45:29.165]  The change that happened in June of 2001, a few months before the Twin Towers came down, where the Joint Chiefs of Staff issued this new instruction, superseding one that had happened in 1997, which required approval by the Secretary of Defense for any potentially lethal support in the event of an aircraft piracy or hijacking.
[01:45:29.826 --> 01:45:36.154]  So, you know, that's what Rumsfeld is doing and Rumsfeld is suddenly not available on 9-11.
[01:45:36.174 --> 01:45:36.535]  That's right.
[01:45:36.555 --> 01:45:46.328]  They took the default in early June that had been there since 57 away from generals and admirals and officers having the default with an aircraft that was going to crash into a city.
[01:45:46.869 --> 01:45:49.170]  They could put AIM-9 Sidewinders into it.
[01:45:49.490 --> 01:46:11.056]  They took the default power away from the actual commanders, gave it only to Rumsfeld, and then he stood down that day, and we have the Transportation Secretary, Mr. Mineta, in the bunker, and Cheney lying later about how early he got there, witnessing him tell the aide the order for the stand-down basically still stands.
[01:46:11.156 --> 01:46:11.817]  Very powerful.
[01:46:12.117 --> 01:46:13.097]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:46:13.649 --> 01:46:14.009]  Exactly.
[01:46:14.029 --> 01:46:16.110]  And by the way, Ventura has incredible courage.
[01:46:16.150 --> 01:46:16.630]  So do you.
[01:46:16.690 --> 01:46:20.151]  But, I mean, we've been covering the stand-down order since it came out months after 9-11.
[01:46:20.651 --> 01:46:28.754]  But the issue is to have prominent people come out and to have him on CNN say, I believe Dick Cheney was involved, and here's the evidence of the stand-down.
[01:46:29.114 --> 01:46:32.176]  I mean, that is life-risking actions.
[01:46:32.216 --> 01:46:32.556]  Go ahead.
[01:46:33.176 --> 01:46:38.198]  Yeah, I have great admiration for Governor Ventura getting out and talking about these things, too.
[01:46:39.682 --> 01:46:44.283]  Thought he held his own pretty damn well against some of the media people that were trying to shoot him down.
[01:46:45.403 --> 01:46:54.466]  We also get into, in the book, the freefall, as it's called, of Building 7, the third skyscraper that came down that day.
[01:46:54.626 --> 01:46:58.327]  And NIST has had to admit now that it did freefall after eight years of denying it.
[01:46:58.427 --> 01:46:58.927]  That's right.
[01:46:59.127 --> 01:47:05.308]  And we include that document in the book, which completely violates the laws of physics.
[01:47:05.708 --> 01:47:08.289]  In other words, a freefall descent for about eight stories
[01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:15.193]  Uh, where there's nothing that can only happen if there's zero resistance to the motion.
[01:47:15.293 --> 01:47:22.058]  So, uh, the NIST report is finally admitting, yeah, that could only be a controlled demolition of some kind.
[01:47:22.498 --> 01:47:29.503]  You know, it's not being caused by the fires or whatever that they were claiming had finally brought the building down.
[01:47:29.543 --> 01:47:32.045]  So, that's very clear stuff.
[01:47:33.511 --> 01:47:55.705]  And, you know, my hope is that people will read the book and scratch their heads and say, wow, I had no idea that we had reached this scale of, not just secrecy, but this is where the country has come to today and our liberties are being threatened in a way that they never have in the history of the country.
[01:47:56.556 --> 01:48:06.984]  And if we have new listeners, as we have a lot of AM and FM affiliates out there who were angered or shocked by us talking about controlled demolitions in the towers, despite the fact that thousands of architects and engineers are on record.
[01:48:07.024 --> 01:48:09.386]  We have the footage of police saying, get back from 7.
[01:48:09.846 --> 01:48:10.686]  They're going to bring it down.
[01:48:10.706 --> 01:48:11.547]  They're going to blow it up.
[01:48:11.987 --> 01:48:15.730]  I heard them on the news that day say they're going to blow up Building 7 to protect the other buildings.
[01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:18.392]  Then people ask, well, how'd you put bombs in there?
[01:48:19.153 --> 01:48:21.454]  You know, when normally it takes weeks and sometimes they still
[01:48:22.611 --> 01:48:22.771]  Don't
[01:48:40.433 --> 01:48:41.513]  We'll put that on screen.
[01:48:41.773 --> 01:48:44.914]  From your research, Dick Russell, I mean, do you concur with my analysis?
[01:48:45.294 --> 01:48:51.556]  Al Qaeda is admittedly set up by Zbigniew Brzezinski, used as a client operation against groups the globalists want to overtake.
[01:48:52.056 --> 01:48:55.757]  Serbia, southern Serbia, Libya, start a war with the Russians.
[01:48:56.057 --> 01:48:57.658]  I mean, Brzezinski brags.
[01:48:58.098 --> 01:49:01.801]  That Al-Qaeda, these Muslim Brigade people, were set up and used.
[01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:05.104]  The Al-Qaeda commanders are New World Order controlled.
[01:49:05.124 --> 01:49:08.507]  A lot of times their low-level fighters don't know that.
[01:49:08.587 --> 01:49:10.069]  They're really Islamist jihadis.
[01:49:10.848 --> 01:49:16.370]  Well, there's certainly plenty of evidence that, you know, Bin Laden and others worked for the U.S.
[01:49:16.410 --> 01:49:17.290]  government in the past.
[01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:18.750]  There's just no doubt about it.
[01:49:19.091 --> 01:49:21.571]  Bin Laden was employed by the CIA in Afghanistan.
[01:49:21.591 --> 01:49:27.753]  I mean, you know, people could say, oh, well, then they turned and, you know, used their knowledge and turned it back on us.
[01:49:27.833 --> 01:49:30.374]  But, you know, I've got grave doubts about that.
[01:49:30.494 --> 01:49:35.116]  I mean, I don't know that I would go quite as far as you, Alex, but I wouldn't rule it out.
[01:49:35.236 --> 01:49:36.576]  They've had special forces.
[01:49:36.656 --> 01:49:38.797]  Delta Force Commander had him, knew where he was at.
[01:49:39.617 --> 01:49:40.938]  And wasn't allowed to kill him.
[01:49:40.998 --> 01:49:42.359]  I mean, it's endless.
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:47.284]  Yeah, and of course, I'm pretty sure they've known where he is for a long time, but he's the boogeyman.
[01:49:47.324 --> 01:50:03.678]  You know, he's, well, he was the big boogeyman until Julian Assange came along and Wikileaks and, and really, I mean, it's just absurd what it's, here we're torturing this guy, Bradley Manning, who apparently, you know, gave the, all these documents to, to Wikileaks.
[01:50:03.758 --> 01:50:04.739]  Which is impossible.
[01:50:04.819 --> 01:50:06.040]  He's the, he's the scapegoat.
[01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:07.201]  Yeah, he's the scapegoat.
[01:50:07.221 --> 01:50:16.150]  He's this, you know, 22-year-old young military guy that is facing 52 years in prison, being held in solitary in Quantico.
[01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:17.231]  Freezing naked!
[01:50:17.251 --> 01:50:18.793]  That's one of the worst forms of torture.
[01:50:18.813 --> 01:50:19.274]  Absolutely.
[01:50:19.314 --> 01:50:21.416]  They keep him in a freezing cell naked for months.
[01:50:21.636 --> 01:50:29.284]  It's outrageous, and it's outrageous that, you know, this guy, one of the people in the administration speaks up about it, and he's suddenly gone.
[01:50:30.325 --> 01:50:41.216]  And they're torturing him if it takes ten years, like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, until he confesses to killing Kennedy, Jesus, crucifying him, and singing the Lusitanian.
[01:50:42.355 --> 01:50:44.496]  Well, they're driving the guy crazy, there's no doubt about it.
[01:50:44.556 --> 01:50:48.899]  And of course, they're trying to get Assange over here, extradited, to do the same thing to him.
[01:50:49.359 --> 01:50:54.802]  With those two CIA-connected women, those honeypots, a lot of news has reported they may be honeypots.
[01:50:55.082 --> 01:50:57.143]  We'll be right back with Dick Russell on the other side.
[01:50:57.563 --> 01:50:59.565]  Stay with us, we'll look at JFK and the Green Men.
[01:51:00.919 --> 01:51:02.181]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.221 --> 01:51:07.568]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:07.808 --> 01:51:12.454]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:12.835 --> 01:51:13.235]  It's true.
[01:51:13.315 --> 01:51:15.899]  Seeds had outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:51:16.139 --> 01:51:17.881]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:51:18.402 --> 01:51:23.083]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:23.623 --> 01:51:25.544]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:51:25.924 --> 01:51:30.545]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:30.725 --> 01:51:31.625]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:31.845 --> 01:51:34.606]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.

[01:51:45.294 --> 01:51:48.037]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.

[01:52:58.098 --> 01:52:58.398]  Tough.
[01:52:58.678 --> 01:52:59.038]  Rugged.
[01:52:59.238 --> 01:52:59.899]  Reliable.
[01:53:04.690 --> 01:53:06.772]  Concerned about nuclear contamination?
[01:53:07.132 --> 01:53:07.912]  You're not alone.
[01:53:08.293 --> 01:53:15.878]  If you understand the risk of today's food being contaminated from nuclear fallout, you would not only trust wild food for survival, you'd count on it.
[01:53:16.278 --> 01:53:19.441]  Wild food is the most prolific, fastest growing food available.
[01:53:19.721 --> 01:53:26.746]  It's fresh, because it doesn't sit in the field for 8 to 10 weeks being fertilized or sprayed with pesticides, accumulating radiation.
[01:53:27.146 --> 01:53:29.228]  And wild food is not genetically altered.
[01:53:29.568 --> 01:53:36.654]  Ounce for ounce, wild food has more nutrition and less harmful elements than any animal or commercial agriculturally grown food.
[01:53:37.034 --> 01:53:38.575]  It can detoxify the body.
[01:53:38.775 --> 01:53:39.596]  And the best part?
[01:53:39.816 --> 01:53:41.737]  Wild food is free for the taking.
[01:53:42.038 --> 01:53:48.282]  Let author Linda Runyon show you how to identify, harvest, prepare, eat, and store wild food.
[01:53:48.563 --> 01:53:50.924]  Go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[01:53:50.945 --> 01:53:52.826]  That's 888-513-2837 or visit ofthefield.com for your survival.
[01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:06.633]  Yeah, we've got the Obama people now worse than Cheney.
[01:54:06.874 --> 01:54:08.896]  Of course, it's just a progression of tyranny.
[01:54:09.396 --> 01:54:14.662]  Arresting reporters in the U.S., charging them for talking to whistleblowers.
[01:54:14.722 --> 01:54:18.485]  I mean, the fundamentals of the First Amendment are under attack.
[01:54:19.166 --> 01:54:24.412]  And even if you don't think 9-11 is an inside job, they're certainly using it to go after our liberties and freedoms.
[01:54:24.432 --> 01:54:26.514]  And we've got the internal government documents where they admit that.
[01:54:28.274 --> 01:54:33.103]  Now going back to Dick Russell, he'll be with us five minutes to the next hour, then I'm getting into all the other news.
[01:54:33.123 --> 01:54:35.146]  I didn't even scratch the surface in the first hour.
[01:54:36.589 --> 01:54:40.956]  But this Mail Online story, it's also, well it's all over the news.
[01:54:42.076 --> 01:54:44.998]  Was JFK killed because of his interest in aliens?
[01:54:45.038 --> 01:54:49.621]  Secret memo shows President demanded UFO files 10 days before death.
[01:54:50.181 --> 01:54:52.183]  Now the question is, did he send this letter?
[01:54:52.263 --> 01:54:52.743]  Is it real?
[01:54:52.783 --> 01:54:53.584]  The FBI is saying.
[01:54:53.864 --> 01:54:57.927]  Then you have these Majestic or Majesty 12 type stuff.
[01:54:58.747 --> 01:55:04.472]  And Dick's been sent the documents before by people saying they're fake, so why is the FBI now putting them out on this site?
[01:55:04.952 --> 01:55:09.636]  This wouldn't be the first time the government puts out secret documents about WMDs in Iraq.
[01:55:09.656 --> 01:55:18.944]  I know about Project Blue Beam that's been partially declassified to have giant fake alien landings or have Muhammad or Christ come back or they could project a giant
[01:55:20.461 --> 01:55:26.403]  Ninja Turtle, Easter Bunny, whatever they wanted to, you know, to freak folks out, along with spring LSD in the air.
[01:55:26.904 --> 01:55:29.925]  Basically, a fake UFO landing's been on the cards for a long time.
[01:55:30.265 --> 01:55:32.106]  Dick Russell, I don't know your view on this.
[01:55:32.446 --> 01:55:35.707]  Give me your view on this pretty big news item.
[01:55:36.513 --> 01:55:53.496]  Yeah, well I've been curious, because in the last week or so, first there was this release of an FBI document about Roswell in 1947, which a few years later, in saying yes, there were several alien bodies recovered from this crash site.
[01:55:53.516 --> 01:55:54.736]  So that was the first thing that happened.
[01:55:54.756 --> 01:56:03.518]  And then yesterday, the CIA apparently released to this researcher named William Lester, who's doing a book on the Kennedy era,
[01:56:04.578 --> 01:56:18.051]  And this is these letters that JFK wrote to the CIA requesting that he see these highly confidential documents about UFOs, and the date is November 12th of 1963.
[01:56:19.992 --> 01:56:25.537]  Now, you know, this looks fascinating on the face of it, but I've got to say that when I was putting together
[01:56:27.098 --> 01:56:33.122]  Uh, this book, 63 Documents, uh, book with Governor Ventura, I thought of, we thought of including a section on UFOs.
[01:56:33.862 --> 01:56:46.730]  And then, uh, and some of these, in fact, the two that were just released, supposedly just released by the CIA, I've got these documents and I've had them for some time and they're part of this whole MJ-12, uh, majestic, uh,
[01:56:48.391 --> 01:57:16.611]  Situation where a researcher was sent all these supposedly secret documents a number of years ago, and that same researcher told me that there's grave doubt about whether these are real or not, and therefore, you know, you'd be advised not to use them, including this famous burn document, which supposedly was dug out of a fireplace, James Angleton's fireplace, head of counterintelligence for CIA, and that indicates that JFK had to be bumped off because he was trying to
[01:57:17.932 --> 01:57:28.738]  Well, there's no doubt.
[01:57:28.778 --> 01:57:30.139]  Have you seen the Battle of L.A.?
[01:57:30.239 --> 01:57:35.302]  It is a pure Marine Corps recruitment ad with kids saying, oh, I'm going to be a big Marine when I grow up.
[01:57:35.742 --> 01:57:36.943]  And they fight the aliens.
[01:57:37.043 --> 01:57:38.504]  And there's this full court press.
[01:57:39.224 --> 01:57:44.568]  You know, that aliens are going to attack us, and Kissinger said that if we ever had this happen, it'd be a great unifier.
[01:57:44.628 --> 01:57:46.729]  Ronald Reagan said similar things.
[01:57:46.890 --> 01:57:52.914]  I think this is the beginning of a major psy-op, and I've been saying this for years, but it's really starting to get creepy.
[01:57:53.911 --> 01:57:59.573]  It's very weird that all of a sudden this stuff is being released to the public and people should begin thinking aliens are real.
[01:57:59.633 --> 01:58:01.094]  And, you know, I'm not saying they're not.
[01:58:01.134 --> 01:58:03.195]  I mean, I've studied UFO literature.
[01:58:03.235 --> 01:58:08.597]  But right as the global meltdown begins, the FBI, CIA, the Green Men are real.
[01:58:08.897 --> 01:58:15.720]  My grandmother, because my grandfather was a leasehound, in 47, was in Roswell.
[01:58:15.780 --> 01:58:20.842]  And she did see troops, big trucks with things under tarps, troops with guns.
[01:58:21.582 --> 01:58:22.542]  So she did see that.
[01:58:22.562 --> 01:58:23.903]  I never even knew this until we were driving.
[01:58:23.943 --> 01:58:24.983]  And we're going to break one minute.
[01:58:25.003 --> 01:58:26.364]  We'll come right back for five more minutes, Dick.
[01:58:26.584 --> 01:58:29.585]  But to finish the story, we're driving back a few days after Christmas.
[01:58:30.025 --> 01:58:31.006]  We're going skiing.
[01:58:31.666 --> 01:58:33.427]  We took an RV out in New Mexico.
[01:58:33.527 --> 01:58:35.188]  We stopped at a Denny's in Roswell.
[01:58:35.628 --> 01:58:37.368]  My grandmother's like, there's the petroleum building.
[01:58:37.388 --> 01:58:38.769]  That's where my husband worked.
[01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:40.710]  And then we learned about the Roswell.
[01:58:42.290 --> 01:58:44.071]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.792 --> 01:58:47.152]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.711 --> 01:58:54.934]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.254 --> 01:58:55.855]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.175 --> 01:58:59.317]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.598 --> 01:59:00.158]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.458 --> 01:59:05.002]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.342 --> 01:59:05.782]  It's true.
[01:59:06.082 --> 01:59:10.646]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.966 --> 01:59:11.506]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.787 --> 01:59:15.069]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.369 --> 01:59:19.072]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.272 --> 01:59:19.812]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.073 --> 01:59:22.434]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.835 --> 01:59:26.217]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.518 --> 01:59:26.718]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.298 --> 01:59:31.221]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.441 --> 01:59:36.205]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.505 --> 01:59:40.527]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.667 --> 01:59:42.228]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.448 --> 01:59:44.549]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:47.311 --> 01:59:48.671]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.691 --> 01:59:54.554]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.441 --> 02:00:09.625]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.285 --> 02:00:11.086]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.867 --> 02:00:12.768]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.408 --> 02:00:17.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.612 --> 02:00:21.656]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.898 --> 02:00:26.040]  Jesse Ventura with Dick Russell, New York Times best-selling authors.
[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:28.902]  63 documents the government doesn't want you to read.
[02:00:28.922 --> 02:00:32.284]  The perfect book tool for those that still read.
[02:00:32.884 --> 02:00:35.826]  Someday it'll be a conspiracy theory that we could ever read or walk.
[02:00:36.366 --> 02:00:38.248]  Trying to ban dodgeball all over the country.
[02:00:38.268 --> 02:00:43.951]  We're gonna be breaking that down as we're turning the little servile prisoners to be inserted into the Matrix for our safety.
[02:00:43.971 --> 02:00:45.692]  There's actually a Pentagon document on that.
[02:00:45.712 --> 02:00:47.273]  It got declassified in 2001.
[02:00:48.134 --> 02:00:51.376]  The whole Matrix movie is based on that, but that's a whole other subject.
[02:00:52.332 --> 02:00:54.233]  They got some really weird theoretical plans.
[02:00:55.054 --> 02:00:58.917]  But there will be peace once you're inserted into the tank.
[02:00:59.437 --> 02:01:00.798]  They ought to pull that article up.
[02:01:00.838 --> 02:01:01.699]  People won't believe that.
[02:01:02.119 --> 02:01:06.462]  Federation of American Scientists leaked it in 2001, actually, and the Pentagon got real mad.
[02:01:06.842 --> 02:01:08.564]  That's a document for you to look up, Dick.
[02:01:08.604 --> 02:01:11.626]  Pretty wild stuff, but truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:01:11.666 --> 02:01:16.449]  Who would have thought we would have cows that have human genes to produce baby milk for humans?
[02:01:17.130 --> 02:01:20.933]  Who would think we had part spider, part goats 15 years ago creating body armor?
[02:01:21.773 --> 02:01:27.854]  Who would have thought we'd have salmon that are insect and that they say will part insect and part other fish.
[02:01:28.294 --> 02:01:33.095]  I mean we're living in a crazy world and thank God you've written this book available at InfoWars.com.
[02:01:33.996 --> 02:01:49.279]  Well thanks very much Alex, I appreciate that and I just hope, I know a lot of people are buying it and at least the reviews on Amazon say that they think it should be required reading for students and all over the country and that's heartening because I really think
[02:01:49.899 --> 02:02:09.923]  You know, people have got to understand what has happened to the country and get some historical perspective and realize that people like Julian Assange, WikiLeaks, who was willing to publish things that the major media wouldn't until he released them to the New York Times and others.
[02:02:10.403 --> 02:02:14.784]  But we're finding out about the secret army in Afghanistan and the knowledge of the drug corruption.
[02:02:15.604 --> 02:02:16.064]  We're good to go.
[02:02:28.407 --> 02:02:28.947]  Well, that's right.
[02:02:28.968 --> 02:02:39.197]  For those that don't know, they have a trick in the last eight years where if they fly you out and you die at Rammstein in Germany, your death doesn't count as a combat casualty.
[02:02:39.217 --> 02:02:42.539]  I mean, just incredible deception.
[02:02:42.559 --> 02:02:44.201]  And now war isn't war.
[02:02:44.261 --> 02:02:46.563]  It's a kinetic military action.
[02:02:46.583 --> 02:02:49.345]  You know, something Jesse said that 20 years, 100 years from now,
[02:02:51.167 --> 02:03:02.771]  He wants these books that you guys have painstakingly researched and put together in a very presentable, powerful read, that it be a record that people understand that we did know what was happening.
[02:03:03.091 --> 02:03:12.955]  Not all of us did go along with this global fascist move, but I see a big awakening happening right now, and that's why the system's panicking.
[02:03:13.355 --> 02:03:14.915]  I don't think we'll have to wait 20, 30, 40, 50 years, but they set up
[02:03:17.156 --> 02:03:21.320]  The National Security Act in 47 and said don't worry in 10-20 years we'll release stuff.
[02:03:21.721 --> 02:03:28.648]  Now they're pushing Kennedy back to 2020 something because they've got something to hide and they shouldn't be arresting people that leak things.
[02:03:28.688 --> 02:03:29.429]  They should get medals.
[02:03:30.521 --> 02:03:31.081]  Absolutely.
[02:03:31.781 --> 02:03:36.423]  But, you know, there's a lot of people in high places that obviously don't want this information out there.
[02:03:36.443 --> 02:03:48.267]  At the same time, our, you know, the Bill of Rights that was set up by our founding fathers is in peril from all the Patriot Act and all these other things that have happened since 9-11.
[02:03:48.867 --> 02:03:51.088]  And, you know, it's just
[02:03:52.342 --> 02:04:03.829]  Just in the book on page 12, I should mention, I'm not going to read them all here, but it goes through the amendments and what has been changed by the Patriot Act in terms of what our rights and freedoms are as Americans.
[02:04:21.681 --> 02:04:45.757]  There will be one more book that we're doing together and it's going to look at the political system and the fact that the two-party system is a complete fiasco and failure and it's not really a call for a third party so much as a whole new way of electing our leaders and trying to get away from this complete monopolization of the political system by the corporate powers.
[02:04:45.837 --> 02:04:48.239]  And it's got a great title but we can't reveal that, can we?
[02:04:48.519 --> 02:04:52.902]  I don't think we can talk it yet, so it's going to be a year from now when the book comes out.
[02:04:52.982 --> 02:04:53.282]  All right.
[02:04:53.342 --> 02:04:56.224]  Dick Russell, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:04:56.504 --> 02:04:57.545]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:58.005 --> 02:04:59.566]  Alex, thanks so much for having me on today.
[02:04:59.666 --> 02:04:59.907]  You bet.
[02:04:59.947 --> 02:05:00.467]  Great having you.
[02:05:00.487 --> 02:05:00.847]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.887 --> 02:05:01.448]  Hello, friends.

[02:05:53.014 --> 02:05:53.414]  Thank you!
[02:06:01.696 --> 02:06:05.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:08.723]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:06:08.964 --> 02:06:13.749]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:06:13.769 --> 02:06:19.995]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.155 --> 02:06:22.398]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:06:22.918 --> 02:06:24.039]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:06:24.059 --> 02:06:24.839]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:06:24.859 --> 02:06:26.540]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:06:41.829 --> 02:06:48.737]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:06:49.117 --> 02:06:58.467]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:07:00.606 --> 02:07:07.272]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:09.915]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[02:07:10.195 --> 02:07:12.397]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[02:07:12.637 --> 02:07:16.801]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[02:07:17.021 --> 02:07:18.483]  You must act automatically.
[02:07:18.703 --> 02:07:21.886]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[02:07:22.226 --> 02:07:24.689]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[02:07:24.989 --> 02:07:32.977]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:07:33.357 --> 02:07:36.120]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:46.044]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[02:07:46.064 --> 02:07:48.125]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:07:48.145 --> 02:07:50.645]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[02:08:01.914 --> 02:08:04.115]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:04.135 --> 02:08:07.657]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.498 --> 02:08:26.927]  It was four years ago under Bush that the Associated Press and others confirmed that in the stage roundups that they do a couple of a year of illegal aliens at meat packing plants and textile facilities, that they would then be taken to ICE facilities and given green cards and released.
[02:08:28.877 --> 02:08:44.740]  Also, we've interviewed many sheriffs and former Border Patrol agents who quit over the fact that in the last two years, under Obama, they have been ordered to not arrest illegal aliens except for during small quota times for PR purposes.
[02:08:46.101 --> 02:08:51.382]  Well, I mean, the banks give illegals bank accounts with no ID, but citizens have to show three forms.
[02:08:52.962 --> 02:08:57.263]  All over the country, sheriffs have gone public who arrest illegals and bring them to the feds, and the feds won't take them.
[02:08:59.114 --> 02:09:00.615]  There's 800 plus sanctuary cities.
[02:09:02.435 --> 02:09:20.863]  What, seven years ago, it's in my minifilm, Battle for the Republic, Vicente Fox came to Austin and gave an award to the state, Wells Fargo, and the Austin Police Department for not arresting illegals for drunk driving, you name it.
[02:09:21.852 --> 02:09:23.153]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[02:09:23.733 --> 02:09:30.319]  Exclusive Arizona Sheriff Cites Flood of Border Agents Confirming Fed's No Apprehension Policy.
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:38.065]  And he says that he's got all these border agents and others confirming that absolutely they're told to let them go.
[02:09:38.085 --> 02:09:46.772]  Remember Bush made it where they had to sit in one site in a truck on hilltops and then they'd only be allowed to look left or right
[02:09:47.694 --> 02:09:49.515]  But not left or right.
[02:09:50.136 --> 02:09:53.458]  And that their main job was picking up garbage on the side of the road.
[02:09:54.358 --> 02:09:56.059]  So, it's the North American Union.
[02:09:56.099 --> 02:09:57.280]  They're merging the countries.
[02:09:57.941 --> 02:10:05.285]  It just shows you the treason of government that we are basically dealing with here.
[02:10:05.866 --> 02:10:09.188]  Also, Obama administration eases pain of Medicare cuts.
[02:10:09.753 --> 02:10:11.815]  Well, I thought it was free health care for everybody.
[02:10:12.395 --> 02:10:15.358]  Oh, it turns out his bill cut people's Medicare.
[02:10:15.398 --> 02:10:18.781]  I thought it was the Republicans that were going to throw seniors out in the street.
[02:10:19.381 --> 02:10:26.348]  But it's the Democrats in Newsweek reporting the case for killing Granny with an image of an old woman unplugged from the wall.
[02:10:27.389 --> 02:10:30.912]  And Bill Gates saying we can hire ten teachers if we don't give Grandma treatment.
[02:10:31.432 --> 02:10:34.054]  Once they collectivize things, they play us off against each other.
[02:10:34.515 --> 02:10:35.416]  I want to break that down.
[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:42.583]  And of course, the huge news that I haven't even gotten to, I've mentioned it, it blows me away, but it doesn't blow me away.
[02:10:43.263 --> 02:10:57.749]  The feds are already making public schools, coast to coast, almost all of them, not play dodgeball, then it's tag, then it's running, then it's shaking hands, then it's wrestling, then it's capture the flag, then it's even jogging.
[02:10:59.450 --> 02:11:04.192]  Well, now New York State's got legislation to basically shut down all of the
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:05.745]  Camps.
[02:11:05.826 --> 02:11:06.455]  Summer camps.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.942]  They're just saying, no, you're not going to be allowed to do that, you will stay indoors.
[02:11:12.162 --> 02:11:19.447]  It says, school will be out, but if it's up to New York State Health Department, a lot of city kids might be spending their time indoors.
[02:11:19.487 --> 02:11:31.235]  New York State Health Department created a list of what they deemed risky recreational activities and forcing many summer programs to ban these games unless they shell out extra funds to be recognized as an official summer camp.
[02:11:31.575 --> 02:11:35.718]  And then they've got to be under the control and then it'll finally be banned.
[02:11:37.364 --> 02:11:38.586]  I've read the legislation.
[02:11:40.769 --> 02:11:44.213]  I was watching Fox this morning and they were kind of reporting it like it might be positive.
[02:11:44.994 --> 02:11:46.496]  CNN was saying it was good.
[02:11:47.437 --> 02:11:53.125]  I mean, if this is the Patriot-Conservative group we've got, gimme Joe Stalin.
[02:11:55.419 --> 02:11:58.961]  And it's just like parents can't pack lunches for their kids in Chicago.
[02:11:59.242 --> 02:12:02.704]  And they've hired the former head of Chicago schools now to be part of the Department of Education.
[02:12:03.364 --> 02:12:08.247]  This is the total tyranny where they give us asinine orders to see if we'll follow them.
[02:12:09.748 --> 02:12:10.949]  I mean, I've had district attorneys on.
[02:12:11.249 --> 02:12:14.131]  It's illegal when they stick their hands on the outside of your pants or in them.
[02:12:14.191 --> 02:12:14.791]  It's a felony.
[02:12:15.792 --> 02:12:17.273]  Homeland Security says we're above the law.
[02:12:19.114 --> 02:12:21.516]  It's illegal that they don't calibrate the radiation scanners.
[02:12:22.591 --> 02:12:24.191]  Congress a year ago demanded those numbers.
[02:12:24.512 --> 02:12:25.972]  They denied them, USA Today.
[02:12:26.232 --> 02:12:28.813]  Finally they got leaked 10 times the radiation they claimed.
[02:12:29.513 --> 02:12:32.454]  On top of the 20 to 50 times what they claimed before.
[02:12:34.134 --> 02:12:36.115]  I mean it's just frying those TSA agents.
[02:12:37.655 --> 02:12:39.335]  They don't care if there's highway checkpoints.
[02:12:41.276 --> 02:12:48.838]  With the Army and the National Guard of State New York, 2000 arrests, Fox News last year of guns and drugs, not on the border, in the middle of the state.
[02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:57.645]  And they showed the military with local police standing beside the giant x-ray scanners with families being told to drive under them.
[02:12:58.066 --> 02:13:06.610]  Just a couple years ago, the Border Patrol got behind lead shielding and put cars on special lifts that, you know, like a car wash that rolled the car through.
[02:13:07.170 --> 02:13:08.791]  Now they just stand... You know what?
[02:13:08.831 --> 02:13:10.272]  Government says magic wand.
[02:13:10.832 --> 02:13:12.193]  This war in Libya isn't a war.
[02:13:12.912 --> 02:13:14.813]  Government weighs Magic Wand.
[02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:17.555]  Yeah, we're cutting your Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.
[02:13:17.595 --> 02:13:18.255]  It's not a cut.
[02:13:18.315 --> 02:13:18.936]  Magic Wand.
[02:13:19.316 --> 02:13:21.017]  Yeah, we're taking the veterans' death benefits.
[02:13:21.057 --> 02:13:21.677]  Magic Wand.
[02:13:21.897 --> 02:13:26.100]  We're not counting troops that die from wounds in Iraq if they're being flown out of the country at the time.
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:27.661]  Magic Wand.
[02:13:29.902 --> 02:13:33.244]  We haven't shown Obama's actual original birth certificate, but it doesn't matter.
[02:13:33.464 --> 02:13:34.465]  We've shown his certificate.
[02:13:34.505 --> 02:13:35.225]  Magic Wand.
[02:13:35.945 --> 02:13:37.566]  Sodium fluoride in your water is good for you.
[02:13:37.606 --> 02:13:38.267]  Magic Wand.
[02:13:40.325 --> 02:13:42.386]  Magic Wand, Magic Wand, Magic Wand.
[02:13:42.746 --> 02:13:44.906]  They just sit there and throw it in our face.
[02:13:44.926 --> 02:13:48.527]  But I just want to spend three or four minutes with Ted, because then I've got to get to the news.
[02:13:49.167 --> 02:13:55.629]  And then coming up, at least for the last half hour of the transmission, your phone calls on any of these items, any of these issues.
[02:13:55.649 --> 02:13:55.989]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:13:56.009 --> 02:13:56.089]  800-259-9231.
[02:13:56.109 --> 02:13:57.809]  And we will get you up and on the air today.
[02:13:57.869 --> 02:13:58.109]  Now,
[02:14:10.936 --> 02:14:11.916]  Here is the headline.
[02:14:12.276 --> 02:14:17.298]  Gold tops $1,500 on Outlook for escalating U.S.
[02:14:17.378 --> 02:14:17.658]  debt.
[02:14:18.478 --> 02:14:20.819]  Geithner says, up the U.S.
[02:14:20.879 --> 02:14:22.699]  debt or we'll have a default.
[02:14:23.119 --> 02:14:36.943]  But S&P, Standard & Poor's pointed out that we're having the default because of the increased debt and that they're defaulting by hyperinflation.
[02:14:38.471 --> 02:14:44.101]  And, meanwhile, they're saying it doesn't matter if China doesn't buy our debt, the Federal Reserve will.
[02:14:44.481 --> 02:14:50.292]  I mean, this is Weimar Republic-type stuff that is now happening, now unfolding today.
[02:14:51.909 --> 02:14:54.531]  This stuff, this stuff is hardcore.
[02:14:54.591 --> 02:14:56.613]  And I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up very briefly.
[02:14:56.993 --> 02:14:59.776]  Gold tops $1,500 on Outlook.
[02:15:00.256 --> 02:15:04.980]  Gold futures rose to a record $1,550 an ounce as U.S.
[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:09.404]  debt concerns weighed on the dollar, boosting demand for precious metals and an alternative investment.
[02:15:09.825 --> 02:15:13.267]  The ultra-elite universities like UT just bought a billion bucks of gold.
[02:15:13.928 --> 02:15:20.871]  They know gold and silver are way undervalued because globally every major currency is being devalued.
[02:15:21.211 --> 02:15:28.395]  Ted, 30 plus years in the gold and silver business, the creator and owner of Genesis Communications, explain to people what's happening.
[02:15:29.107 --> 02:15:33.369]  Well, Alex, it's the hottest market that I've ever seen in both gold and silver.
[02:15:33.509 --> 02:15:44.754]  I mean, Barclays, Barclays is saying that we'll see $1,520 an ounce within the next couple of weeks, and then calling for $1,600 an ounce within the next six months.
[02:15:45.115 --> 02:15:48.596]  What's happening right now is the Federal Reserve is buying U.S.
[02:15:48.636 --> 02:15:49.657]  government treasuries.
[02:15:50.177 --> 02:15:59.123]  Financing the expenditures of the United States government at the expense of everyone's savings, including the people in China, but also here in the United States.
[02:15:59.504 --> 02:16:12.413]  Because there's so much money being pumped into the system, that's why S&P is saying, hey, what you're doing is you're creating massive inflation, you're creating an incredible bubble in the currency market.
[02:16:12.953 --> 02:16:15.055]  And the value of the currency is going to go downhill.
[02:16:15.376 --> 02:16:23.304]  You're going to either default by not paying off the debt, by not raising the debt ceiling, or you're going to default by allowing the Fed to buy U.S.
[02:16:23.344 --> 02:16:24.365]  government treasuries.
[02:16:24.745 --> 02:16:25.366]  Doesn't matter.
[02:16:25.426 --> 02:16:29.370]  Either way, the United States dollar is doomed and this country is going right down the hill.
[02:16:29.390 --> 02:16:31.652]  You know, I mean, gold went to $1,500 an ounce.
[02:16:31.672 --> 02:16:32.133]  My goodness, Alex.
[02:16:34.235 --> 02:16:37.879]  Right now, we are so close to $44 silver.
[02:16:37.899 --> 02:16:40.121]  I mean, it's like two cents away.
[02:16:40.141 --> 02:16:43.204]  I mean, that's how things are going right now.
[02:16:43.544 --> 02:16:46.227]  The value of the dollar is going down very fast.
[02:16:46.307 --> 02:16:47.328]  Foreigners can see it.
[02:16:47.688 --> 02:16:54.775]  And the people of the United States, if you haven't woken up to the fact that your savings is going right down the tubes, man,
[02:16:55.656 --> 02:17:06.486]  You know, people that have not acquired a position in gold and silver who are sitting there with 401k plans, money in the bank, invested in the stock market.
[02:17:06.587 --> 02:17:08.188]  I mean, I don't care what it is.
[02:17:08.568 --> 02:17:11.932]  If it's in dollar-denominated assets, you're in trouble.
[02:17:12.532 --> 02:17:14.173]  And you better do something different.
[02:17:14.213 --> 02:17:21.298]  The reason why these big institutions are buying gold and silver is because they can see the handwriting on the wall.
[02:17:21.618 --> 02:17:26.141]  And typically these types of institutions wouldn't even touch gold and silver.
[02:17:26.661 --> 02:17:32.925]  And only about 1% of Americans, it's more with the Chinese, Indians and Europeans, own physical gold or silver.
[02:17:33.626 --> 02:17:34.507]  Once the yuppies
[02:17:35.327 --> 02:17:35.407]  Yes.
[02:17:56.212 --> 02:17:58.655]  Currency system, but Ted, we've only got about a minute and a half left.
[02:17:58.675 --> 02:18:02.920]  I'm going to come back, go to some phone calls, and then I'll get into the news, because I want to go to calls.
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:06.564]  But I wanted to get you on to list people, because these are the best deals out there.
[02:18:06.844 --> 02:18:10.268]  And everybody says that, folks, but if you research it, you'll be blown away.
[02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:13.112]  The three silver dollars, the free shipping, three of my films, $115.
[02:18:13.452 --> 02:18:13.692]  That's $70 off.
[02:18:16.135 --> 02:18:22.057]  I mean, that's below where you can get these three silver dollars for anywhere, $115 with the free shipping and the three films.
[02:18:22.898 --> 02:18:28.120]  But you've also got a bunch of other gold coins that are the radio specials because you bought them when it was lower.
[02:18:28.380 --> 02:18:29.400]  You're holding the price.
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:32.422]  You're not doing what other brokers do, going up, which is reasonable.
[02:18:32.682 --> 02:18:33.762]  Buy it low, take the risk.
[02:18:34.122 --> 02:18:35.123]  When it goes up, go up.
[02:18:35.503 --> 02:18:36.503]  You're not doing that.
[02:18:39.329 --> 02:18:43.573]  You know, going even further, it's like letting folks get in a time machine and go back and get this gold and silver.
[02:18:43.873 --> 02:18:51.679]  Plus, most brokers, and I'm not trying to be mean, it's well known, they wait and get your order, most big companies, and then they go out and get the gold.
[02:18:51.859 --> 02:18:52.980]  No, no, no, not Ted Anderson.
[02:18:53.020 --> 02:18:55.603]  It's all in stock, on hand.
[02:18:56.203 --> 02:18:57.644]  That's why you gotta get these deals now.
[02:18:57.724 --> 02:19:00.707]  Ted, list a cornucopia of the special radio deals.
[02:19:01.332 --> 02:19:13.503]  You know, the things that we have in our safe are like buffaloes and eagles and older $20 gold pieces and the British Sovereigns, the Franks, just a whole list of various different gold coins.
[02:19:13.543 --> 02:19:16.446]  If you want to get really close to melt, buy the bars.
[02:19:17.467 --> 02:19:23.132]  The gold bars right now are about the only thing that hasn't pushed up in real high premiums.
[02:19:23.372 --> 02:19:24.834]  That would be where I'd suggest that you go.
[02:19:25.454 --> 02:19:41.061]  And without a question, I mean, if you haven't taken advantage of the three silver dollars and the videos for 115 bucks, I mean, I don't know, you know, other than giving, walking from door to door and giving these things away for free, I don't know how I could make a better deal than that.
[02:19:41.341 --> 02:19:41.861]  Absolutely.
[02:19:41.901 --> 02:19:43.542]  Here's the toll-free number 800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.562 --> 02:19:45.883]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.103 --> 02:19:54.448]  There on screen for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, for radio listeners.
[02:19:54.468 --> 02:19:54.668]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:55.248 --> 02:19:56.689]  Protect yourself from the globalists.
[02:19:56.909 --> 02:19:59.350]  They're buying gold and silver, but they're telling you not to.
[02:19:59.770 --> 02:20:00.671]  Use your heads, folks.
[02:20:01.491 --> 02:20:01.952]  The U.S.
[02:20:02.012 --> 02:20:03.653]  economy is at a tipping point.
[02:20:04.034 --> 02:20:06.776]  Forty cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed.
[02:20:07.137 --> 02:20:15.545]  The President of the Federal Reserve in Dallas was recently quoted saying, this path will lead to insolvency, resulting in the collapse of our government and our economy.
[02:20:15.926 --> 02:20:19.009]  Our country can't function like this, and neither can your household.
[02:20:19.329 --> 02:20:22.692]  That's why you need to prepare, and priority one is your food supply.
[02:20:23.353 --> 02:20:26.514]  Definitely, it's easy and affordable with the help of Ready Reserve Foods.

[02:21:01.232 --> 02:21:02.433]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:21:02.673 --> 02:21:03.593]  The real U.S.
[02:21:03.734 --> 02:21:08.857]  unemployment rate is now 22%, and not 9% like what we are told by the mainstream media.
[02:21:09.037 --> 02:21:13.700]  The primary instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education.
[02:21:13.840 --> 02:21:19.443]  But all across America, students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs.
[02:21:19.823 --> 02:21:27.588]  Most college graduates are now admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having their lives destroyed by student loans.
[02:21:27.988 --> 02:21:37.791]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association are getting ready to release College Conspiracy, the world's most comprehensive documentary ever produced about America's college education system.
[02:21:38.031 --> 02:21:45.533]  To be among the first to see College Conspiracy, sign up for the free NIA newsletter today at www.inflation.us.
[02:21:45.853 --> 02:21:49.775]  NIA believes that college education is the largest scam in American history.
[02:21:49.995 --> 02:21:54.416]  College Conspiracy will expose the facts and truth about the education system here in the U.S.
[02:21:54.716 --> 02:21:59.560]  Sign up for free today at inflation.us to be among the first to see College Conspiracy.
[02:21:59.941 --> 02:22:04.505]  Earthquakes, hurricanes, nuclear accidents, terror attacks, and all out social collapse.
[02:22:04.605 --> 02:22:08.908]  With the world today more volatile than ever, the future has never looked more uncertain.
[02:22:09.009 --> 02:22:12.832]  Survivalist Magazine is the one resource you can't afford to be without.

[02:22:24.923 --> 02:22:26.184]  Your survival may depend on it.
[02:22:30.228 --> 02:22:34.190]  If you breathe, eat, or drink, your body's pH balance is at risk.
[02:22:34.471 --> 02:22:44.197]  Micronized activated zeolite is the only product of its kind on the market that can balance pH levels and offset immediate and long-term effects of nuclear fallout.
[02:22:44.217 --> 02:22:47.899]  100% natural, safe, and gentle enough for children, animals, and pregnant women.
[02:22:48.059 --> 02:22:51.461]  Activated zeolite available at RadiationFix.com or call 619-249-2574.

[02:23:00.026 --> 02:23:01.287]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:01.327 --> 02:23:06.671]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:23:06.911 --> 02:23:11.534]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:23:11.934 --> 02:23:12.335]  It's true.
[02:23:12.415 --> 02:23:16.958]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:23:17.498 --> 02:23:22.200]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[02:23:22.720 --> 02:23:24.661]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[02:23:25.041 --> 02:23:29.643]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[02:23:29.843 --> 02:23:30.743]  And here's the best part.
[02:23:30.963 --> 02:23:33.725]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:37.306]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[02:23:37.626 --> 02:23:38.206]  We're good to go!
[02:24:06.573 --> 02:24:08.715]  I wish we could kick the globalists out of this country.
[02:24:08.735 --> 02:24:15.000]  But first, we've got to identify them for the public.
[02:24:15.080 --> 02:24:18.423]  And we're engaged in that process right now.
[02:24:18.783 --> 02:24:19.443]  Here's what I want to do.
[02:24:19.463 --> 02:24:21.125]  I want to take ten phone calls or so.
[02:24:21.145 --> 02:24:24.427]  Then I'll get to all the other news I haven't covered yet.
[02:24:25.949 --> 02:24:31.173]  And there's a lot of it on Fukushima, on Morgellons, on health care.
[02:24:32.418 --> 02:24:34.218]  Is something going on with the gate in there today?
[02:24:34.238 --> 02:24:36.199]  I keep hearing my microphone cut in and out.
[02:24:36.839 --> 02:24:37.999]  Kind of like a gate's closing.
[02:24:38.019 --> 02:24:41.960]  You might get the IT guys in there or the engineer in there to look at that.
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:43.121]  Are you guys hearing that?
[02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:46.321]  I hear like the audio go up and then pop when it cuts back in.
[02:24:49.622 --> 02:24:51.182]  Harmon says he's not hearing any changes.
[02:24:51.603 --> 02:24:52.923]  I'm hearing something going on with this mic.
[02:24:54.223 --> 02:24:55.583]  I'll guarantee you something's been changed.
[02:24:55.984 --> 02:24:56.424]  No big deal.
[02:24:56.464 --> 02:24:57.084]  We'll figure it out.
[02:24:57.324 --> 02:24:58.864]  But let's go to your phone calls right now.
[02:24:59.024 --> 02:25:00.305]  Bill in Connecticut.
[02:25:00.765 --> 02:25:01.665]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:25:03.427 --> 02:25:04.128]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:25:04.848 --> 02:25:19.940]  Um, I was watching television and a commercial came on for Homeland Security and it shows a train coming into a train station and there's a young guy just standing on the train, you know, next to the, on the, um, the platform there.
[02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:22.201]  And so I wrote down what it said.
[02:25:22.261 --> 02:25:26.284]  In fact, I recorded it, but first I'd like to read what it says.
[02:25:28.006 --> 02:25:32.269]  You never know when you'll see something suspicious, but you,
[02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:34.431]  But you know your daily routine.
[02:25:35.331 --> 02:25:38.512]  If you say something, if you see something, say something.
[02:25:39.313 --> 02:25:41.013]  Yes, it could turn out to be nothing.
[02:25:41.614 --> 02:25:43.194]  But what if it is something?
[02:25:43.995 --> 02:25:48.556]  And then you hear a phone dialing and it says, Connecticut Homeland Security, tip line.
[02:25:49.257 --> 02:25:54.359]  And then you hear a young, young man's voice say, I want to report something.
[02:25:55.459 --> 02:26:01.102]  So they leave it very vague and nebulous so that, you know, it's basically right out of Orwell's 1984.
[02:26:02.429 --> 02:26:04.930]  Report anything that you see, basically.
[02:26:05.070 --> 02:26:06.391]  Well, it's don't trust anyone.
[02:26:06.431 --> 02:26:10.512]  That's what airs on the telescreens at 9,000 locations, public parks.
[02:26:11.193 --> 02:26:15.254]  Don't trust anyone but Janet Napolitano, who works for the bankers that are robbing us.
[02:26:15.874 --> 02:26:16.975]  Don't trust each other.
[02:26:16.995 --> 02:26:18.215]  The terrorists are everywhere.
[02:26:18.315 --> 02:26:19.496]  Ignore the drug cartels.
[02:26:19.576 --> 02:26:21.857]  Ignore the banks laundering money.
[02:26:22.437 --> 02:26:23.637]  I haven't seen the ad.
[02:26:23.717 --> 02:26:27.359]  I've heard radio ads about what are those guys doing in that work truck?
[02:26:27.779 --> 02:26:30.020]  See something, say something, and then they call.
[02:26:30.261 --> 02:26:34.243]  But you notice, we've called all the Homeland Security numbers, and no one answers.
[02:26:34.263 --> 02:26:41.207]  The one time they did, they wouldn't take my report on Anwar al-Awlaki, the head of Al-Qaeda, admittedly hanging out at the Pentagon.
[02:26:41.867 --> 02:26:44.048]  So, again, it's all a joke.
[02:26:44.609 --> 02:26:48.891]  But police have been calling all over the country, raiding people's houses and snooping events.
[02:26:49.452 --> 02:26:54.154]  It's also in the Patriot Act, Section 213, sneak and peek, claiming that, oh, we had a 911 call.
[02:26:55.695 --> 02:27:00.357]  And so that's, this is just the excuse to, well we're here, somebody thought they saw something.
[02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:02.659]  So yes, it's the Stasi Society, Bill.
[02:27:03.979 --> 02:27:06.561]  Would you like, I recorded it, I don't know how well it came out.
[02:27:06.581 --> 02:27:07.221]  Yeah, crank it up.
[02:27:07.561 --> 02:27:09.802]  Hold the phone right up to the speaker if you're going to do it though.
[02:27:10.323 --> 02:27:13.244]  Okay, it may be a little garbled because you hear the train coming.
[02:27:13.304 --> 02:27:14.345]  No, I understand.
[02:27:14.365 --> 02:27:15.045]  Hold on.
[02:27:19.619 --> 02:27:20.299]  I don't think so.
[02:27:45.344 --> 02:27:53.548]  Yeah, well also they have local threat fusion centers that are really federal, answer the phone with local cops, training them at their homeland security.
[02:27:54.188 --> 02:27:59.171]  And now they've got the goon force sticking their hands down your pants, so they're setting the precedent here.
[02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:02.111]  Yeah, it's absolutely amazing.
[02:28:02.612 --> 02:28:03.512]  It's really amazing.
[02:28:03.972 --> 02:28:05.752]  But it's not 1984, Bill.
[02:28:05.812 --> 02:28:06.393]  Don't worry.
[02:28:06.813 --> 02:28:08.873]  It is a war in Libya, but it isn't a war.
[02:28:09.153 --> 02:28:11.794]  And they were never going to put ground troops in, but they were there the whole time.
[02:28:12.114 --> 02:28:12.834]  Everything's fine.
[02:28:13.134 --> 02:28:14.595]  The bankers are going to take care of you.
[02:28:15.035 --> 02:28:17.775]  If we don't go bankrupt, we're going to go bankrupt, Geithner says.
[02:28:18.896 --> 02:28:21.036]  If we don't get into more debt, we're going to default.
[02:28:21.736 --> 02:28:23.177]  Let's talk to Tony in Iowa.
[02:28:23.217 --> 02:28:24.017]  Tony, you're on the air.
[02:28:24.037 --> 02:28:27.118]  Hey, Alex.
[02:28:27.138 --> 02:28:27.538]  How are you?
[02:28:27.718 --> 02:28:27.958]  Good.
[02:28:28.018 --> 02:28:28.318]  Welcome.
[02:28:29.366 --> 02:28:30.447]  Thanks for taking my call Alex.
[02:28:30.567 --> 02:28:31.667]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:28:32.528 --> 02:28:53.640]  I've got to thank my friend Jake for getting me to tune in to you a couple years back and now I've been a Prison Planet subscriber for about two years and I just want to encourage people, if they haven't already done so, check that out because it's not just what we're seeing on the TV every day, or on Prison Planet TV, but it's the library, the archive of stuff that's there too, and I've just spent hours on end, you know, educating myself.
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:54.421]  I want to thank you there.
[02:28:55.097 --> 02:29:01.823]  Well, I want to thank you, but aren't you excited that Janet Napolitano is going to have a new TV show, directly telling us how she's saving us?
[02:29:01.843 --> 02:29:06.147]  I mean, that's freedom, to have the Homeland Leader with her own TV show!
[02:29:07.588 --> 02:29:08.769]  Alex, that stuff is crazy.
[02:29:08.929 --> 02:29:15.115]  And I, you know, it used to be a situation you could walk into a Walmart, pick up some ammunition for your rifle, shotgun.
[02:29:15.656 --> 02:29:19.899]  Now, with all of this crap going on... We must swipe your license to buy that!
[02:29:19.999 --> 02:29:21.341]  You are, you are the enemy!
[02:29:22.517 --> 02:29:23.577]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:29:23.878 --> 02:29:24.438]  We'll stay there.
[02:29:24.458 --> 02:29:26.679]  I'm going to come back to you on the other side and then some other calls.
[02:29:27.039 --> 02:29:29.740]  And I'm getting into a news blitz here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:30.441 --> 02:29:32.181]  But crooks took over America.
[02:29:33.302 --> 02:29:40.385]  They've got to totally turn us into a police state or we'll take the government back and stop them from their total takeover.
[02:29:40.945 --> 02:29:42.146]  And then they'll be brought to justice.
[02:29:42.186 --> 02:29:43.947]  See, they're not going to give us quarter.
[02:29:44.267 --> 02:29:44.887]  They're coming.
[02:29:45.447 --> 02:29:46.728]  We got to stand up and meet them.
[02:29:47.088 --> 02:29:47.829]  It's very simple.
[02:29:48.069 --> 02:29:48.489]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.155 --> 02:29:54.159]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.081 --> 02:29:57.765]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.806 --> 02:30:01.927]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:30:01.968 --> 02:30:08.635]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:30:08.895 --> 02:30:11.198]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:30:11.458 --> 02:30:16.664]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:30:16.844 --> 02:30:19.607]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:30:19.888 --> 02:30:21.950]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:30:22.170 --> 02:30:28.113]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:30:28.433 --> 02:30:31.635]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:30:31.815 --> 02:30:37.337]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:30:37.598 --> 02:30:38.898]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:30:39.238 --> 02:30:40.399]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:30:40.539 --> 02:30:43.080]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:44.621]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:30:44.881 --> 02:30:47.242]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:30:47.422 --> 02:30:51.904]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:52.044 --> 02:30:54.485]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:30:54.625 --> 02:30:58.326]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:30:58.486 --> 02:30:59.467]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:00.487 --> 02:31:04.450]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:31:04.690 --> 02:31:10.735]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:31:11.095 --> 02:31:18.201]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[02:31:18.481 --> 02:31:23.064]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:31:23.365 --> 02:31:27.548]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com.
[02:31:32.011 --> 02:31:35.713]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter and see what he has to say.
[02:32:01.072 --> 02:32:15.544]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:32:16.545 --> 02:32:20.208]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:32:21.229 --> 02:32:33.221]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:32:34.001 --> 02:32:41.248]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:32:41.949 --> 02:32:51.542]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:32:52.323 --> 02:32:55.608]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:32:56.248 --> 02:32:59.353]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:33:23.291 --> 02:33:30.735]  Yeah, more and more they have TV shows about the government and what Heroes Homeland Security is.
[02:33:31.396 --> 02:33:36.719]  The New York Times reports, though, that race issues rise for Miami police.
[02:33:37.619 --> 02:33:46.445]  On the TV show produced dealing with the Miami police, they said on tape, we hunt, one officer says in a five and a half minute clip.
[02:33:46.565 --> 02:33:48.326]  I like to hunt, hunt people.
[02:33:49.781 --> 02:33:58.276]  And it says McNeil was the 7th African American to be shot and killed by Miami police in those months while the TV show was being filmed.
[02:33:58.336 --> 02:33:59.117]  Shot in the back.
[02:33:59.598 --> 02:34:00.380]  All part of the hunting.
[02:34:04.085 --> 02:34:08.226]  But don't worry, you can learn how to worship our new leader, Janet Napolitano.
[02:34:08.406 --> 02:34:20.569]  AMC plans real-life Don Draper Homeland Security reality shows on the cable network AMC labeled Mad Men, The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad.
[02:34:20.609 --> 02:34:24.110]  Plans to launch a pair of reality shows exploring the high-pressure world.
[02:34:24.870 --> 02:34:28.772]  of advertising the behind-the-scenes drama of the Department of Homeland Security.
[02:34:28.832 --> 02:34:30.053]  How they're keeping us safe.
[02:34:30.333 --> 02:34:30.953]  Oh, yes.
[02:34:31.374 --> 02:34:37.377]  When they're not meeting with Anwar al-Awlaki, the number two of Al-Qaeda, who runs all the terror attacks.
[02:34:37.857 --> 02:34:40.979]  Oh, he's very helpful when he launches those attacks, then they can take our rights.
[02:34:41.519 --> 02:34:46.502]  In fact, we'll put that Fox News piece back up there for folks who are out there in denial.
[02:34:48.263 --> 02:34:49.524]  Going back to Tony in Iowa.
[02:34:49.564 --> 02:34:51.045]  Tony, go ahead and make your point.
[02:34:51.886 --> 02:35:03.912]  Well, you know, Alex, what's really laughable about DHS, Janet Napolitano, they consistently try to stigmatize patriots or patriot-related groups as being paranoid, right?
[02:35:04.452 --> 02:35:08.014]  How much more paranoid can you get than the very concept of this campaign?
[02:35:08.627 --> 02:35:11.148]  If you see something, say, I called to report something.
[02:35:11.829 --> 02:35:13.589]  How much more paranoid can you get than that?
[02:35:13.629 --> 02:35:14.630]  It's a freak state.
[02:35:16.251 --> 02:35:17.651]  I'd actually call to make a comment.
[02:35:17.731 --> 02:35:22.454]  We're historically paranoid and upset about the open tyranny being set up.
[02:35:22.494 --> 02:35:24.495]  And they're saying, no, don't look at that.
[02:35:24.855 --> 02:35:25.915]  Look at your neighbors.
[02:35:26.256 --> 02:35:27.376]  Al-Qaeda is everywhere.
[02:35:27.396 --> 02:35:33.059]  But don't look at them at the Pentagon, or being trained at US bases, or being protected, or attacking Gaddafi and working for the globalists.
[02:35:33.319 --> 02:35:34.360]  Ignore all that.
[02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:35.940]  They're under your chair.
[02:35:35.960 --> 02:35:37.061]  They're in the backyard.
[02:35:37.421 --> 02:35:43.604]  Not at the Pentagon, not at the Defense Language School, even though the Dean quit and said they were training the 9-11 hijackers.
[02:35:44.864 --> 02:35:46.285]  I'm sorry, you called about something else.
[02:35:47.806 --> 02:35:49.647]  It was your interview with Dick Russell earlier.
[02:35:49.727 --> 02:35:55.049]  One of your topics was the recently declassified NSA memorandum number 271.
[02:35:55.629 --> 02:35:56.830]  Yeah.
[02:35:57.450 --> 02:36:03.273]  Pertaining to, in essence, the cooperation with the Soviet Union on outer space matters.
[02:36:04.031 --> 02:36:26.211]  And I think that that, if nothing else, if people can set aside the UFO possible connection about this information and what it really means to us, it's the geopolitical significance of that memo and Kennedy's assassination in that short window following that really kind of points toward the military-industrial complex and what they're willing to do to get rid of any possible obstruction to the agenda.
[02:36:26.611 --> 02:36:27.452]  Monetary agenda.
[02:36:27.912 --> 02:36:28.773]  You understand, of course.
[02:36:29.631 --> 02:36:32.893]  Um, and just a quick question for you, Alex, maybe before I leave.
[02:36:33.433 --> 02:36:38.076]  On Proven Planet TV here, on the previous commercial break, I saw something I don't think I've seen before.
[02:36:38.096 --> 02:36:40.137]  It was like a live peek-in in the studio.
[02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:43.959]  Will we be able to see that filthed man-calf again sometime, Alex?
[02:36:44.079 --> 02:36:45.740]  Thanks for taking my call, buddy.
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:47.200]  Alright, take care, buddy.
[02:36:47.661 --> 02:36:49.802]  Yeah, no, I have never worn shorts.
[02:36:51.158 --> 02:36:51.238]  Yeah.
[02:37:21.198 --> 02:37:21.598]  Afternoon.
[02:37:40.217 --> 02:37:41.998]  I think I'm gonna do it like seven days a week.
[02:37:42.038 --> 02:37:47.959]  I mean, there's just, there's gotta be one way to, you know, get the little, the 20 or so pounds I've got on me off.
[02:37:48.499 --> 02:37:51.540]  Cause I'm, I mean, I'm in okay cardiovascular shape and I can run a couple of miles.
[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:53.561]  I can swim two miles, three miles when needed to.
[02:37:54.301 --> 02:37:56.421]  I can lift a little weights, but I'm still just a blob.
[02:37:57.022 --> 02:37:58.742]  And, uh, so that's what's going on there.
[02:37:58.782 --> 02:37:59.982]  And I was screwing around during the break.
[02:38:00.042 --> 02:38:03.503]  I was gonna, we were testing cameras during the break is how it started.
[02:38:03.563 --> 02:38:05.704]  Cause I said, this camera looks a little darker than usual.
[02:38:07.119 --> 02:38:10.542]  And the guys are like, no, we're looking at the calibration system, doesn't look like it is.
[02:38:10.562 --> 02:38:12.063]  I said, well, let me just walk in there.
[02:38:12.524 --> 02:38:14.025]  And I thought, hey, I'll just act silly.
[02:38:14.385 --> 02:38:15.326]  Something I show out.
[02:38:15.707 --> 02:38:17.568]  Okay, enough side issues.
[02:38:18.429 --> 02:38:25.335]  Tony, Tony did see the PresentPlanet.TV during the commercial break cut in of me with my hard little legs.
[02:38:26.056 --> 02:38:28.758]  Tom in PA, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:38:29.639 --> 02:38:30.379]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:30.960]  Good, sir.
[02:38:32.026 --> 02:38:34.087]  I'm wondering if you read the U.S.
[02:38:34.207 --> 02:38:39.110]  government printing document that was released yesterday for the 221,367 national DTD handbooks?
[02:38:47.336 --> 02:38:56.261]  No, I didn't see that, but I know that the Houston Chronicle, Wall Street Journal, five years ago admitted the FEMA camps have been built for citizens.
[02:38:56.301 --> 02:39:05.225]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act states that it's all with their own documents in Dick Russell's book, but Glenn Beck told us it doesn't exist, so everything's fine.
[02:39:05.545 --> 02:39:06.446]  Give me the headline.
[02:39:06.466 --> 02:39:10.248]  I mean, I did see last year the internment camp jail guard ads.
[02:39:11.088 --> 02:39:34.229]  For the US because the government cares so much about us during the economic implosion they've engineered But give me the name of the article you read that had the link or give me the name of the actual printing order And I'll search that right now Okay, I have it on the web cache a Google user content and calm They are the GPO already pulled it
[02:39:34.639 --> 02:39:38.260]  But they didn't pull it off of the user content.
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:39.181]  Listen, do me a favor.
[02:39:39.201 --> 02:39:39.641]  Do me a favor.
[02:39:39.661 --> 02:39:40.581]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:39:41.081 --> 02:39:46.623]  You have email, because it's hard to go search a whole Google system, Google Wayback or Archive.
[02:39:46.943 --> 02:39:48.884]  I want you to send it to my producer right now.
[02:39:49.984 --> 02:39:51.025]  How fast can you send me an email?
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:52.861]  I could have it there.
[02:39:52.901 --> 02:39:54.743]  Matter of fact, just give me the address.
[02:39:55.223 --> 02:39:58.847]  I have the link already in and I already made a photo.
[02:39:59.047 --> 02:40:00.108]  Okay, well hold on.
[02:40:00.148 --> 02:40:01.569]  I want to put you on hold for a minute.
[02:40:02.490 --> 02:40:05.393]  Give him the producer's email and then put him back on air with me.
[02:40:05.754 --> 02:40:08.436]  But give him my producer's private email, John, please.
[02:40:10.618 --> 02:40:14.222]  Okay, just give him Jaron's email and then we'll put him back on air.
[02:40:15.612 --> 02:40:19.598]  Because this sounds important enough and it fits in with all the other stuff we've got.
[02:40:19.618 --> 02:40:22.723]  I want to make sure I get it right now before this transmission ends.
[02:40:25.668 --> 02:40:26.770]  Okay, John, did you give him that info?
[02:40:26.790 --> 02:40:29.214]  Did you spell it for him?
[02:40:31.573 --> 02:40:33.534]  Okay, so he's taking care of that right now.
[02:40:33.554 --> 02:40:34.435]  We're gonna bring him back up.
[02:40:35.476 --> 02:40:41.760]  But there are... Look, I've been to the urban warfare drills, and I've talked to police all over the country.
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:48.824]  I've had emergency managers on from Texas and Indiana, and they have been training for years for mass arrest.
[02:40:49.665 --> 02:40:52.147]  And an army truck drives around, and there's a SWAT team up the street.
[02:40:52.227 --> 02:40:53.808]  We don't come out and get on it, and that's the end of it.
[02:40:54.348 --> 02:40:55.529]  Mr. Jones, we're here to pick you up.
[02:40:56.830 --> 02:40:57.810]  And we'd like you to resist.
[02:40:57.850 --> 02:40:58.471]  We'd like to hunt.
[02:40:59.718 --> 02:41:01.360]  We're here to make sure the banks destroy America.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:04.302]  Now the question is, will the troops follow the orders?
[02:41:04.362 --> 02:41:05.584]  Most of them did in Katrina.
[02:41:06.144 --> 02:41:07.786]  They didn't bring the food and water in under orders.
[02:41:07.806 --> 02:41:12.510]  They went to the high and dry areas and went into the houses and busted open the gun safes and took people's guns with them.
[02:41:12.811 --> 02:41:14.372]  Went ahead and put them in handcuffs while they were at it.
[02:41:15.073 --> 02:41:15.954]  Law-abiding citizens.
[02:41:15.974 --> 02:41:16.955]  That's what the military's for.
[02:41:18.058 --> 02:41:19.718]  And people better wake up, just like in Germany.
[02:41:19.778 --> 02:41:21.579]  Germans said, we can't say our military's bad.
[02:41:21.599 --> 02:41:22.479]  Heil Hitler.
[02:41:22.879 --> 02:41:26.360]  Well, you better learn to not say, Heil Obama, Heil New World Order.
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:27.600]  Heil UN.
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:29.500]  Going back to the caller.
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:34.001]  Caller, I can probably search it right now, even though you're emailing it to us, Tom.
[02:41:35.302 --> 02:41:37.262]  I can probably search it right now.
[02:41:37.342 --> 02:41:44.443]  What's the name of the government printing office number that you're seeing for this US internment handbooks?
[02:41:47.688 --> 02:41:49.249]  It's jacket number 735-412-413.
[02:41:49.269 --> 02:41:53.971]  And it's for National Detainee Handbook in Spanish and in English.
[02:42:15.073 --> 02:42:21.415]  221,367 copies, plus two GPO Chicago inspection samples.
[02:42:21.995 --> 02:42:29.437]  Yeah, well they've also, that's why they had later admitted, I remember three years before it happened, the rumors came out, GPSing every front door.
[02:42:29.778 --> 02:42:32.798]  And then they've got the census asking, when are you home, what do you do?
[02:42:33.139 --> 02:42:35.979]  So they can come in with their little, you know, file on you.
[02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:38.240]  Oh, it's a criminal hardcore group.
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:40.441]  Let me search that term right now.
[02:42:42.052 --> 02:42:43.433]  And, uh, here it is.
[02:42:43.533 --> 02:42:46.796]  It's, uh, quite a bit of news reporting on it.
[02:42:47.777 --> 02:42:49.438]  National Detainee Handbook.
[02:42:50.779 --> 02:42:52.921]  And, uh, it looks like I found it right here.
[02:42:52.941 --> 02:42:55.963]  Uh, and you just sent that email off, right?
[02:42:56.764 --> 02:42:57.164]  Yeah, I did.
[02:42:58.405 --> 02:42:58.825]  Okay.
[02:42:59.746 --> 02:43:04.550]  I even took a, like, a photocopy and sent it as an attachment as well, along with the link.
[02:43:05.491 --> 02:43:07.833]  Yeah, this was uploaded 13 hours ago to YouTube.
[02:43:08.695 --> 02:43:09.136]  I'm trying to.
[02:43:23.069 --> 02:43:24.730]  Jaron, in fact, here it is.
[02:43:24.810 --> 02:43:25.070]  U.S.
[02:43:25.090 --> 02:43:26.111]  Government Printing Office.
[02:43:26.812 --> 02:43:27.632]  And I'm looking at it.
[02:43:27.652 --> 02:43:29.373]  I'm looking at a YouTube copy of it.
[02:43:29.393 --> 02:43:30.574]  It says G20.
[02:43:31.335 --> 02:43:34.837]  Oh, the G20 was a model where they wouldn't let anybody protest or even be on the streets.
[02:43:35.158 --> 02:43:39.741]  Then they had snatch and grabs there to scare the public with plainclothes and military people.
[02:43:39.761 --> 02:43:42.583]  And then they also did the same thing in Toronto and in London.
[02:43:43.123 --> 02:43:48.267]  So this is all part of their conditioning system, yes, for mass arrests and roundups.
[02:43:49.070 --> 02:43:50.911]  The unauthorized assembly.
[02:43:51.371 --> 02:43:53.272]  I mean, you hear that here in America.
[02:43:53.712 --> 02:43:54.753]  Unauthorized assembly.
[02:43:54.793 --> 02:43:55.593]  I couldn't get over that.
[02:43:57.234 --> 02:43:59.896]  We didn't have more of a waking at that point.
[02:43:59.916 --> 02:44:01.176]  Well, they had the army involved.
[02:44:01.196 --> 02:44:07.380]  They arrested Rob Dube for videotaping at a college campus because they couldn't find anybody who would go out and shop or go on the street.
[02:44:07.740 --> 02:44:11.662]  So they knew a few miles away a college had a park where people eat lunch.
[02:44:12.222 --> 02:44:16.064]  And we've got all the footage of that and they just showed up and the students are like, we're not even, we're here.
[02:44:16.464 --> 02:44:19.005]  And they chased him even into the dorms and Billy clubbed him.
[02:44:19.385 --> 02:44:22.486]  And they saw Rob up on a hilltop videoing, so they took him in.
[02:44:23.086 --> 02:44:29.049]  They had detainees with bags over their heads and he said the cops and military were just seething with evil love.
[02:44:29.409 --> 02:44:33.851]  I mean, they were just screaming at people, laughing at people, strip searching them.
[02:44:33.911 --> 02:44:36.712]  It was just an orgy of death of America.
[02:44:36.752 --> 02:44:37.372]  And don't worry.
[02:44:38.092 --> 02:44:40.053]  Don't worry, cops and military that are into this stuff.
[02:44:40.073 --> 02:44:41.294]  You're going to get everything you want.
[02:44:41.894 --> 02:44:46.938]  You're going to be judged, right along with the 50 million babies that have been aborted, all of it.
[02:44:47.059 --> 02:44:48.019]  You want evil?
[02:44:48.059 --> 02:44:48.760]  You think it's tough?
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:49.621]  You're going to get it.
[02:44:49.641 --> 02:44:53.844]  I know most cops and military are not evil, but I'm telling you, they need to make a choice right now.
[02:44:54.925 --> 02:44:55.986]  Jared, did you get that email yet?
[02:44:58.128 --> 02:45:00.390]  I'm hitting print on it right here so you guys can get it.
[02:45:01.371 --> 02:45:02.912]  I just entered it in while he was reading it.
[02:45:03.653 --> 02:45:05.815]  What else struck your fancy in that article you were reading?
[02:45:07.145 --> 02:45:08.466]  Oh, well, it really wasn't the article.
[02:45:08.546 --> 02:45:10.347]  I'm looking at the document itself.
[02:45:10.507 --> 02:45:11.948]  No, that's what I meant, the article, yeah.
[02:45:12.809 --> 02:45:20.674]  Yeah, well, just the idea that there are, you know, 221,000, what I'm figuring is that this will be the first actual prison city.
[02:45:21.274 --> 02:45:25.537]  I mean, Rahm Emanuel's in there now, just like Giuliani was in New York when 9-11 happened.
[02:45:25.637 --> 02:45:30.700]  Oh, they had Blagojevich say that they're going to use the Army for door-to-door gun confiscation three years ago.
[02:45:31.521 --> 02:45:34.483]  Sure, and that's why he got in trouble and he's out, you know?
[02:45:34.503 --> 02:45:36.304]  I mean, you know, it's...
[02:45:37.092 --> 02:45:39.452]  I just get worried for the people of Chicago.
[02:45:39.672 --> 02:45:40.513]  You know, I really do.
[02:45:40.553 --> 02:45:44.373]  And now all of a sudden there's 160 nuke bombs hitting around America, you know?
[02:45:44.673 --> 02:45:52.635]  If you remember a few years back, they had claimed a bunch of Al Qaeda members escaped with high security clearance.
[02:45:52.875 --> 02:45:53.695]  Do you recall that?
[02:45:54.775 --> 02:45:57.095]  This was maybe back five, six, seven years ago.
[02:45:57.115 --> 02:46:01.036]  I'm sorry, caller, what were you saying?
[02:46:02.056 --> 02:46:06.177]  Do you remember several years back where they announced that a bunch of
[02:46:06.718 --> 02:46:12.502]  Members of Al Qaeda had escaped, and they had high clearance cards.
[02:46:14.083 --> 02:46:15.524]  This was back some years ago.
[02:46:15.604 --> 02:46:16.445]  Yes, I remember it.
[02:46:17.165 --> 02:46:17.385]  Right.
[02:46:17.425 --> 02:46:18.466]  They wanted to prep us.
[02:46:18.866 --> 02:46:23.890]  Now they're saying that there's 160 nuclear bombs hidden around America.
[02:46:24.574 --> 02:46:28.035]  You know, it's sort of, you know, like the frog in the pot.
[02:46:40.479 --> 02:47:07.350]  uh... the actual document and write a blurb on that right now at Infowars.com but for now Marley we just go ahead and get the document up so we have a page with it linked with our own copy off of uh... google before they take it down off google and uh... then we'll have Kurt and his story that he writes about it uh... link into that uh... dealing with it but but what is suspicious is I'm now seeing the news reports on it that this went people found this yesterday and they pulled it today why would the U.S.
[02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:08.571]  printing office pull that?
[02:47:09.011 --> 02:47:11.153]  Because they don't want the public knowing about this.
[02:47:11.873 --> 02:47:12.754]  Right, exactly.
[02:47:12.774 --> 02:47:17.337]  You know, I have a, I open a website, my name's Thomas Gilroy, it's thomasgilroy.com.
[02:47:17.397 --> 02:47:25.483]  I put, um, like the House Resolutions, Senate Bills, I have all your documentaries at the top, and then right below them I have the documents to cross-reference.
[02:47:26.058 --> 02:47:29.261]  You know, I'm going to try to post it, but I'm kind of leery about them.
[02:47:29.301 --> 02:47:30.622]  They've been pulling a lot of stunts.
[02:47:30.782 --> 02:47:31.363]  Oh, you know what?
[02:47:31.403 --> 02:47:32.324]  Post it everywhere.
[02:47:32.364 --> 02:47:34.226]  When they pull stuff, everybody should post it.
[02:47:34.826 --> 02:47:36.828]  You know, they put this stuff out and they don't want us to know.
[02:47:36.848 --> 02:47:38.750]  Look, we can't give in to them.
[02:47:39.090 --> 02:47:40.491]  They are murdering criminals.
[02:47:40.531 --> 02:47:43.414]  That's why we have to stand up and call them for what they are.
[02:47:43.454 --> 02:47:45.035]  They're going to win, and we can't let them win.
[02:47:45.055 --> 02:47:45.996]  I mean, this is life and death.
[02:47:46.357 --> 02:47:47.338]  All we can do is fight.
[02:47:48.177 --> 02:47:50.819]  in the info war and get everybody ready and that's all we can do.
[02:47:50.859 --> 02:47:51.399]  We're committed.
[02:47:51.779 --> 02:47:52.279]  It's on.
[02:47:52.460 --> 02:47:53.080]  That's the way it is.
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:53.880]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:53.900 --> 02:47:55.101]  That's why I love taking calls.
[02:47:55.121 --> 02:47:57.222]  They bring up stuff like that every time I, you know, take calls.
[02:47:57.663 --> 02:47:59.284]  David in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:47:59.324 --> 02:47:59.644]  Welcome.
[02:48:00.644 --> 02:48:01.485]  Hey, thank you very much.
[02:48:01.505 --> 02:48:06.908]  I've been watching on President Planet TV for a while now and I echo the previous caller who said, yeah, sign up everybody.
[02:48:07.989 --> 02:48:10.110]  Alex, maybe you can make a comment about this.
[02:48:10.150 --> 02:48:11.651]  You alluded to it a few weeks ago.
[02:48:12.518 --> 02:48:25.474]  That a lot of modern, let's say, Christianity in the last 150 years has had this relatively new notion of the End Times, Mark of the Beast, Antichrist, where
[02:48:25.982 --> 02:48:32.123]  A lot of Christians that I talk to, I am a Christian, but I don't believe this form of... No, it's a total cop-out.
[02:48:32.443 --> 02:48:38.785]  They get real happy when they hear about people being arrested or tortured or implantable chips, and they go, praise the Lord, the end is near.
[02:48:39.105 --> 02:48:43.325]  Well, even if it was, what's God going to think about you for not speaking out against it?
[02:48:43.345 --> 02:48:45.106]  But the truth is, they're going to go through it all.
[02:48:45.606 --> 02:48:47.066]  They're totally brainwashed.
[02:48:47.086 --> 02:48:51.047]  The Globalist, on record, really the last hundred, taught all this as a cop-out.
[02:48:51.587 --> 02:48:53.509]  And that's why most Christians are not Christians.
[02:48:53.529 --> 02:48:55.090]  They go to church for a social group.
[02:48:55.390 --> 02:48:58.493]  Their church is a 501c3 government charity, not a church.
[02:48:58.913 --> 02:49:00.515]  That's how it's under government regulations.
[02:49:01.135 --> 02:49:02.937]  And they are in deep, deep trouble.
[02:49:04.138 --> 02:49:08.822]  Yeah, and if we took another view, I mean, let's just say we're going to be here another 10,000 years.
[02:49:08.982 --> 02:49:10.523]  Don't you want to have done something positive?
[02:49:10.983 --> 02:49:11.444]  I'd rather
[02:49:12.037 --> 02:49:15.459]  I'd go down swinging and have my children have a fighting chance.
[02:49:15.479 --> 02:49:17.720]  Look, most Christians won't even... No, I hear you.
[02:49:17.761 --> 02:49:21.523]  Most Christians won't even criticize abortion because they think it's politically incorrect.
[02:49:21.883 --> 02:49:22.824]  I mean, they're not Christians.
[02:49:22.864 --> 02:49:26.426]  They're Christianoid people, and they're fakes, and they're cowards.
[02:49:26.466 --> 02:49:27.807]  And that's what they want, and that's what they get.
[02:49:28.067 --> 02:49:30.508]  You know, the way is not wide, it's narrow.
[02:49:31.209 --> 02:49:32.389]  And I'm not here on a high horse.
[02:49:32.429 --> 02:49:33.370]  I mean, you know what?
[02:49:33.430 --> 02:49:36.312]  People want to see this great evil unfolding and lay down to it?
[02:49:36.632 --> 02:49:37.873]  Well, I know which side they're on.
[02:49:38.733 --> 02:49:40.634]  They were hot nor cold, spit them out of the mouth.
[02:49:40.914 --> 02:49:43.415]  But you were saying you'd rather stand and fight.
[02:49:44.415 --> 02:49:44.995]  Yeah.
[02:49:45.576 --> 02:49:47.236]  What am I going to leave my children with?
[02:49:47.817 --> 02:49:53.819]  If I'm wrong and there's nothing I can do about it and we're all going to get raptured out, okay, what did I lose?
[02:49:53.879 --> 02:49:56.020]  But if I'm right... Well, it's a test.
[02:49:56.060 --> 02:50:01.822]  Besides, if you read Revelation, the beast makes war on the saints, cutting their heads off.
[02:50:02.142 --> 02:50:03.843]  How is this happening if they're all raptured?
[02:50:04.123 --> 02:50:14.289]  The rapture is the dead in Christ after Christ comes back, and the archangel ties up the devil and throws him into the pit and puts him on display for a thousand years and all the rest of it.
[02:50:14.329 --> 02:50:23.275]  I mean, it's clear English, and these fake churches are New World Order, controlled by the Rockefeller World Council of Churches, and it's not in the Bible.
[02:50:23.335 --> 02:50:27.157]  It says the dead in Christ are lifted up, and then... I mean, it's all right there.
[02:50:27.637 --> 02:50:31.520]  It's all right there, but they don't want to see it because it's too scary for them.
[02:50:32.888 --> 02:50:37.874]  I mean, most mainline Christians think it's of the Lord to have Al-Qaeda working for the globalists attacking Gaddafi.
[02:50:39.031 --> 02:50:41.352]  I mean, you know, they've been given strong delusion.
[02:50:41.412 --> 02:50:42.033]  They want it.
[02:50:42.413 --> 02:50:43.273]  They're going to get it.
[02:50:43.514 --> 02:50:45.555]  They're going to think the Antichrist is Jesus.
[02:50:45.635 --> 02:50:46.015]  Watch!
[02:50:46.715 --> 02:50:49.617]  Oh, they're going to... the Antichrist is going to say he's Christ.
[02:50:49.937 --> 02:50:51.278]  They're going to say, oh, he came back.
[02:50:51.738 --> 02:50:54.880]  Oh, oh, Jesus wants me to take this chip.
[02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:56.841]  Oh, oh, I love you, Jesus.
[02:50:57.141 --> 02:50:58.242]  What nice horns you have.
[02:50:58.422 --> 02:50:59.603]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:50:59.643 --> 02:51:00.563]  I love you so much.
[02:51:00.863 --> 02:51:03.265]  My name is Megan, and this is my LifeLock story.
[02:51:03.625 --> 02:51:08.628]  Imagine opening your door and coming face to face with your identity thief.
[02:51:08.948 --> 02:51:12.450]  Identity thieves use my identity to buy cell phones and computers online.
[02:51:12.670 --> 02:51:17.473]  They shipped the stolen phones to my home, where they actually staked out my house waiting for the delivery.
[02:51:17.713 --> 02:51:23.276]  Fortunately, Megan had advanced warning from LifeLock, and a potential tragedy was averted.
[02:51:23.496 --> 02:51:30.399]  I believed LifeLock would protect me from identity theft, but when thieves showed up at my home, LifeLock just may have saved more than money.
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:32.741]  LifeLock's services are amazing.
[02:51:32.921 --> 02:51:35.062]  They do what they say they'll do, and it's worth it.
[02:51:35.442 --> 02:51:40.346]  LifeLock is on a mission to help stop identity theft, but they can't protect you if you're not a member.
[02:51:40.566 --> 02:51:44.370]  The call takes just minutes, plus you'll get 60 days of LifeLock risk-free.
[02:51:44.570 --> 02:51:48.613]  If you're not delighted, call LifeLock within 60 days of enrollment and you won't pay a cent.
[02:51:48.753 --> 02:51:49.674]  Restrictions apply.
[02:51:49.754 --> 02:51:51.415]  See LifeLock.com for details.
[02:51:51.616 --> 02:51:51.856]  Call 1-800-560-0031.
[02:51:51.876 --> 02:51:51.936]  1-800-560-0031.
[02:51:51.956 --> 02:51:52.016]  1-800-560-0031.
[02:52:03.331 --> 02:52:05.253]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:52:05.653 --> 02:52:06.153]  The U.S.
[02:52:06.233 --> 02:52:12.958]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:52:13.499 --> 02:52:16.141]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:52:16.221 --> 02:52:19.463]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:52:19.563 --> 02:52:26.148]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:52:26.208 --> 02:52:28.810]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:29.311]  Treasuries.
[02:52:29.711 --> 02:52:33.173]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[02:52:33.213 --> 02:52:38.795]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:52:39.155 --> 02:52:47.159]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:52:47.619 --> 02:52:56.983]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:53:00.376 --> 02:53:05.358]  Freedom, the blistering anti-globalist anthem from the rock band Ravelin.
[02:53:18.565 --> 02:53:20.728]  Spring and a new growing season are here.

[02:53:36.664 --> 02:53:46.988]  Easy, because OrganicaSeed.com offers one of the largest online selections of organic, heirloom, non-hybrid, and untreated seeds, as well as tobacco and cotton seeds at low prices.
[02:53:47.228 --> 02:53:49.029]  Go to OrganicaSeed.com.

[02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:05.447]  Okay, we only got like five minutes left.

[02:55:12.917 --> 02:55:18.479]  And we've also been promoting a great song that they got behind in finance that's hit number four on the GAC charts.
[02:55:18.879 --> 02:55:19.879]  You heard it here first.
[02:55:20.380 --> 02:55:23.201]  And of course, that's Looking for America by Mark Wills.

[02:55:35.185 --> 02:55:39.647]  gusset.com g-u-s-s-e-t.com forward slash sale to
[02:55:39.787 --> 02:55:43.972]  Would you be surprised if we had aliens from outer space?
[02:56:01.374 --> 02:56:02.895]  That would be a question for you.
[02:56:02.915 --> 02:56:04.236]  Would you be surprised?
[02:56:04.256 --> 02:56:16.164]  You know, I've seen the globalists in Hollywood hyping this forever as part of a PSYOP, and I've got documents, and I think they're going to have a bunch of guys in rubber suits land and tell us to worship, you know, worship Al Gore or something.
[02:56:16.184 --> 02:56:18.626]  I mean, I just go off what I can prove.
[02:56:18.646 --> 02:56:22.169]  And yeah, the government's putting out all these documents saying little green men are running around everywhere.
[02:56:22.189 --> 02:56:29.814]  I would like to say that in the Bible, it states that God made the world with an S on the end of it.
[02:56:30.535 --> 02:56:34.181]  And it's in King James, Hebrews, second verse.
[02:56:35.282 --> 02:56:41.051]  And when I was in service, it was rumored that they was at Wright-Patterson.
[02:56:44.110 --> 02:57:04.698]  Well, they report that, and they've made deals with them, and they're basically advising the globalists how to poison us and how to do all these horrible things to us, and it'd be great to believe it was little green men doing this to us instead of our own species, but I never talk about stuff like this, but now it's becoming so mainstream and so out in the open that it's almost passe.
[02:57:05.978 --> 02:57:10.220]  All I know is my grandfather and grandmother, because he got sent different places for like a year, 47, lived in Roswell.
[02:57:13.407 --> 02:57:20.370]  I think that they were possible and I believe that they're not harmful to us because they could have done great harm to us a long time ago and they have not.
[02:57:41.064 --> 02:57:43.366]  So, I don't think they're upset at all.
[02:57:44.207 --> 02:57:47.450]  Well, those that believe in all this and research it say there's a lot of different groups.
[02:57:48.070 --> 02:57:52.274]  So, uh... Again, I can't believe I'm even discussing this.
[02:57:52.354 --> 02:57:54.917]  I can't get people to admit there's FEMA camps when it's all public.
[02:57:55.797 --> 02:57:59.461]  Or that the government's putting sodium fluoride with a seven-fold increase in bone cancer in the water.
[02:57:59.861 --> 02:58:00.401]  So, I don't know.
[02:58:00.442 --> 02:58:05.206]  With the CIA and FBI coming out saying little green men are real and they're hanging out with the government.
[02:58:05.306 --> 02:58:06.227]  I mean, I don't know, man.
[02:58:07.148 --> 02:58:12.274]  I guess Dave Mustaine of Megadeth is right again with his Rust in Peace record.
[02:58:12.775 --> 02:58:13.656]  I appreciate your call.
[02:58:13.676 --> 02:58:17.561]  I had a nice talk with Dave Mustaine yesterday, not name-dropping.
[02:58:17.581 --> 02:58:21.025]  He invited me out to that big Megafour rock concert in the desert.
[02:58:21.446 --> 02:58:22.868]  He was in Israel for
[02:58:24.346 --> 02:58:24.887]  Passover.
[02:58:25.107 --> 02:58:25.747]  Christian guy.
[02:58:25.767 --> 02:58:28.790]  I don't think I'll be going to that next week.
[02:58:28.810 --> 02:58:29.391]  He's probably listening.
[02:58:29.411 --> 02:58:30.312]  Hi Dave and your wife.
[02:58:30.332 --> 02:58:30.833]  Great folks.
[02:58:30.853 --> 02:58:32.654]  I don't know why I just brought up Dave Mustaine.
[02:58:32.674 --> 02:58:35.878]  It's just funny how prophetic all of his music is.
[02:58:36.298 --> 02:58:37.619]  Retransmission starts now.
[02:58:37.719 --> 02:58:39.221]  Infowars.com.
[02:58:39.241 --> 02:58:39.741]  Stay with us.
