[00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:10.069]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:11.509]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.230]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.451]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:22.132]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.306]  We are live.
[00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.929]  It is a worldwide transmission.
[00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.172]  It is Wednesday, the 16th day of November 2011.
[00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:42.016]  And we got some grave news yesterday.
[00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:51.406]  It's now up at DrugsReport.com and Paul Watson has got a big breaking report coming out at Infowars.com in the next few minutes.
[00:00:52.782 --> 00:00:56.487]  Gerald Salente's gold account was emptied out over $100,000.
[00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:59.251]  He's just saying over six figures.
[00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:03.077]  He doesn't want to say how much over $100,000 it was.
[00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:07.363]  And Watson's article just went live seconds ago.
[00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:12.547]  MF Global looted customers accounts via internal bank run.
[00:01:12.848 --> 00:01:15.710]  This was getting almost no attention in the last few days.
[00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.713]  They were just talking about its bankruptcy because it has the former New Jersey Governor Corzine running it.
[00:01:21.134 --> 00:01:22.555]  It's tied all into the Globalist.
[00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:24.496]  It's a front group for Goldman Sachs.
[00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:26.317]  That's admitted here in all the articles.
[00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:30.821]  But it isn't just Gerald Salente's gold account that was his private segregated account.
[00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:38.411]  No, they looted their customers regular cash accounts and the neocons are spending it.
[00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:41.793]  That's free market to lose your money.
[00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:43.174]  No, it's not.
[00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:51.560]  Not when you have a bank account and they declare bankruptcy and then take $900 million of it and give it to JP Morgan.
[00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.932]  And all of you neocons, because I heard neocon this morning on the radio defending it.
[00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:03.861]  All of you guys pushing this and defending it and calling $27 trillion in banker bailout to foreign banks, free market.
[00:02:04.882 --> 00:02:07.286]  They're going to take your bank accounts and your pensions too.
[00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:11.091]  And whatever you've got left, they're going to devalue it through hyperinflation.
[00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:16.315]  I'm seeing Democrats defend this as well.
[00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.997]  It is truly disgusting.
[00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:21.498]  And I've got a Twitter here that Drudge is linked to.
[00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:25.340]  We have the man himself joining us, Gerald Cilente, coming up 20 minutes from now.
[00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:31.684]  This is from Gerald Cilente's Twitter, Gerald Cilente, twitter.com forward slash Gerald Cilente.
[00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:34.725]  I'm going to retweet this at Real Alex Jones.
[00:02:35.426 --> 00:02:37.687]  We should tweet it right now that Cilente's coming on.
[00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:40.689]  Bankrupt MF Global.
[00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:46.329]  Fires entire 1066 workforce.
[00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.894]  He goes on to say, by the way, I got hammered by MF Global 2.
[00:02:52.375 --> 00:02:55.057]  Too bad Corzine didn't die in his car accident.
[00:02:55.898 --> 00:03:00.922]  And by the way, Salente was on with us on the nightly news last night.
[00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:04.866]  And that restreamed after it first aired over and over again every once in a while.
[00:03:04.886 --> 00:03:07.248]  The upload of the MP4 archive fails.
[00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:09.250]  So it isn't on our YouTube channel yet.
[00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.571]  Or you better believe it'd be on Drudge right now.
[00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.954]  But he's linked to the RT piece, which is great.
[00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:24.181]  It's just that he went into more detail in our interview last night, and we are going to stream, re-stream, re-air part of that coming up in the next segment.
[00:03:24.321 --> 00:03:26.943]  Then, Gerald Salente will join us live.
[00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:31.147]  But why is this such a big deal?
[00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:33.803]  Why is this so huge?
[00:03:34.704 --> 00:03:40.189]  Because it turns out the SEC and the CFTC knew about this three weeks ago.
[00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.032]  I have all the mainstream Reuters forms all right here.
[00:03:44.153 --> 00:03:51.840]  They all knew about it and no one was warned and this was basically allowed to be done.
[00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.003]  Now that people are screaming bloody murder, by the way this didn't start breaking
[00:03:56.144 --> 00:04:00.666]  about the missing accounts until yesterday when Salente went on RT in the morning.
[00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:05.008]  Then that forced the business channels and Bloomberg and others to start covering it.
[00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:15.472]  This is a big deal because it shows that, well they're admitting it, it shows the start of a new 2008 style crisis and this is a new type of bank run.
[00:04:15.512 --> 00:04:20.915]  This is an internal bank run by these big hedge funds and people that are now in banking.
[00:04:21.795 --> 00:04:23.176]  That's what getting rid of Glass-Steagall did.
[00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:31.711]  MF Global gobbled up, Salente's been doing this for close to 40 years, what he said, since 1972.
[00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:47.749]  So they gobbled up the gold trading company, where he actually was getting physical delivery, and then took the money out of his account, and then contacted him saying, oh there's no money in your account, put more in, obviously with the intent of grabbing that up.
[00:04:49.167 --> 00:04:51.788]  And so this signifies the accelerating collapse.
[00:04:51.808 --> 00:04:54.989]  I mean, I cannot describe to you how big this is.
[00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.729]  We're going to break it down on the other side.
[00:04:56.749 --> 00:04:57.410]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.511]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:02.871 --> 00:05:08.673]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.
[00:05:09.173 --> 00:05:12.794]  So now is the time to express the holiday spirit more than ever.
[00:05:13.194 --> 00:05:18.456]  Consider helping those you love with the most important gift, a supply of delicious, easy

[00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:07.012]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:06:08.212 --> 00:06:12.974]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:20.156]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:24.378]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:06:24.418 --> 00:06:28.419]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:06:30.578 --> 00:06:34.440]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.281]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[00:06:39.001 --> 00:06:39.822]  Others don't.
[00:06:40.242 --> 00:06:42.123]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:06:42.383 --> 00:06:43.903]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:06:44.164 --> 00:06:46.725]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:06:47.045 --> 00:06:51.106]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.

[00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:58.409]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it.
[00:06:58.749 --> 00:06:59.630]  Others don't.
[00:07:05.094 --> 00:07:05.995]  Tyranny is here.
[00:07:06.355 --> 00:07:09.876]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:07:09.916 --> 00:07:12.498]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:07:12.518 --> 00:07:17.961]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:24.624]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:07:25.024 --> 00:07:30.565]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:07:31.005 --> 00:07:34.686]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:07:35.186 --> 00:07:39.187]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:07:39.487 --> 00:07:44.988]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:07:45.428 --> 00:07:48.388]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:07:48.988 --> 00:07:50.409]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:51.389]  It's here.
[00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:59.092]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:02.693 --> 00:08:08.715]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.316 --> 00:08:12.337]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.220]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:21.957 --> 00:08:37.464]  Folks listening all across the world on XM Radio, Global Shortwave, and over the internet at InfoWars.com, to all of our AM and FM listeners here in the United States and Canada, we have two affiliates on AM and FM in Canada, to all of you, thank you so much for tuning in today.
[00:08:38.752 --> 00:08:56.400]  We have broken down the fact that there is a global concerted effort by the six big megabanks to implode the global economy by design with the six big megabanks that have bought off the major legislatures, the Congress, and the Parliaments of Europe to then publicly pose as the saviors
[00:08:58.177 --> 00:09:13.883]  During each leg of the engineered implosion and then always the answer to the last crisis is more power to the globalist, more global government, more tyranny, more taxes, more trillions paid to the offshore banks who engineered the whole thing.
[00:09:15.624 --> 00:09:23.667]  European technocratic dictatorship now announced on every news channel and they're telling yuppies, technocracy and tyranny will keep your stock market up.
[00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:26.648]  We are now being fully bathed in evil.
[00:09:28.882 --> 00:09:31.244]  They have now come out and said, oh, it's soft corruption.
[00:09:32.726 --> 00:09:49.023]  It's no big deal that the Congress, the leadership of the Congress, insider trades, knowing how bills are going to be voted on, knowing what funding, what companies are going to get, and actually
[00:09:50.051 --> 00:09:59.777]  Passing government funding and port barrel directly to companies, in some cases, their wives, husbands, fathers, mothers, children own.
[00:10:00.638 --> 00:10:08.323]  And they just have Nancy Pelosi come out and say, yeah, my wealth doubled in four years, gone up 60 plus percent in two, yours has gone down 20 plus percent.
[00:10:08.803 --> 00:10:10.544]  I'm allowed to insider trade.
[00:10:11.285 --> 00:10:18.650]  And 60 Minutes announces it and calls it soft corruption when it's the most hardcore type there is.
[00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:26.116]  This is the essence of corporate globalist fascism, crony capitalism at the barrel of a gun.
[00:10:26.456 --> 00:10:30.200]  Homeland Security is the prison planet takeover of America.
[00:10:31.241 --> 00:10:39.888]  It is the system of making Americans prisoners and even giving us prisoner induction training with checkpoints and TSA now on the highways.
[00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:47.777]  We have Denver Post and others promoting how great it is that citizens are being taught to not even trust their best friends and family.
[00:10:48.477 --> 00:10:49.738]  We have a report out on that today.
[00:10:50.178 --> 00:10:52.858]  No one can be trusted but government.
[00:10:53.439 --> 00:10:58.240]  Giant telescreens going up all over the place saying, trust no one but government.
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.261]  Terrorists are everywhere.
[00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:05.422]  The only people who aren't terrorists are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, the New World Order.
[00:11:05.702 --> 00:11:06.582]  They're here to help you.
[00:11:06.963 --> 00:11:08.003]  Everybody else is bad.
[00:11:09.088 --> 00:11:14.553]  Al Qaeda wants to get you, but never mind the fact that the bankers put them in over Libya, and are trying to put them in Syria.
[00:11:14.953 --> 00:11:15.754]  I mean, this is it!
[00:11:17.535 --> 00:11:19.056]  And then the other shoe dropped.
[00:11:19.237 --> 00:11:21.839]  A major sign in the acceleration.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:31.827]  I have never, since the Great Depression, seen banks run off with people's secured accounts.
[00:11:32.388 --> 00:11:35.991]  People's segregated bank accounts, gold accounts, you name it.
[00:11:37.256 --> 00:11:43.057]  And since I learned about this yesterday, I'm now discovering other companies are doing this right now.
[00:11:43.977 --> 00:11:53.059]  And I know why the system in the last two weeks didn't make a big deal out of this and kept it very quiet until Solente was finally the straw that broke the camel's back yesterday morning on RT.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.181]  Because when people figure out that they're not just going to devalue your currency, they may just not even let you have your money.
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:07.085]  They may just snatch your safety deposit boxes, and I'm seeing more and more of that by the feds, but now they're just talking about taking it all.
[00:12:09.927 --> 00:12:14.631]  And you can type into the search engine, more municipalities seizing safety deposit boxes.
[00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:16.173]  I mean, there's a lot of weirdness going on.
[00:12:16.963 --> 00:12:17.423]  Why not?
[00:12:17.463 --> 00:12:23.384]  They already took the veterans' death benefits 12 years ago, made deals with the insurance companies to take them when the people try to collect them.
[00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:24.945]  They can keep that quiet.
[00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:27.325]  So Gerald Salente is coming up.
[00:12:27.765 --> 00:12:28.946]  Imagine, he has over $100,000.
[00:12:29.066 --> 00:12:39.028]  He won't say how much more, but he says it's six figures of his money in his account at MF Global.
[00:12:39.108 --> 00:12:44.709]  MF Global had bought the commodity company that he was with, that he had an account with,
[00:12:46.354 --> 00:12:48.616]  And they just took it out of the segregated account.
[00:12:49.617 --> 00:12:53.140]  And I've got all the reports here where they just in plain view admit it.
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.022]  Commissioner views MF Global darkly.
[00:12:58.604 --> 00:13:02.127]  This just came out yesterday and it turns out for upwards of three weeks they knew.
[00:13:02.207 --> 00:13:04.128]  Now guess who the commissioner is?
[00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:05.910]  Guess who the head is?
[00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:06.550]  Listen to this.
[00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:07.611]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:13:08.092 --> 00:13:12.315]  CFTC head didn't want to distract from MF Probe.
[00:13:12.655 --> 00:13:13.716]  This is November 7th.
[00:13:14.777 --> 00:13:15.818]  This is more than a week ago.
[00:13:17.711 --> 00:13:18.433]  And you know why?
[00:13:18.613 --> 00:13:26.912]  Buried in the article, it says the head of the CFTC, the Commodities Federal Commission,
[00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:39.139]  It turns out that he has close ties with MF Global's former chief executive, John Corzine, and Goldman Sachs.
[00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:40.940]  They're all in business together.
[00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:42.502]  That's why they're doing this.
[00:13:42.722 --> 00:13:47.167]  Let's go to the Gerald Solenta interview from last night that he's coming up live on the other side of this break.
[00:13:47.727 --> 00:13:48.909]  InfoWars.com.
[00:13:53.373 --> 00:13:56.939]  Gerald Solente, I mean, this is off the charts insane.
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.202]  Did I get it right?
[00:13:58.282 --> 00:13:59.664]  Correct anything if I was wrong?
[00:14:00.683 --> 00:14:02.705]  Yes, you got it essentially right.
[00:14:03.305 --> 00:14:10.690]  And I've been saying this a long time, you know that, that they're going to impose some level of economic martial law.
[00:14:11.271 --> 00:14:18.376]  And I thought, of course, it would be in the banks that they're going to call a bank holiday of some sort and devalue the dollar.
[00:14:19.076 --> 00:14:24.000]  But what I did is I had an account, and I've been trading gold, by the way, Alex, since 1978.
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.341]  I've never had a problem.
[00:14:28.323 --> 00:14:33.426]  What I do is like airlines and grain companies, you buy futures.
[00:14:34.187 --> 00:14:36.188]  And I buy gold futures.
[00:14:36.768 --> 00:14:42.992]  Some people speculate with them, I buy futures with the intention of taking delivery.
[00:14:43.792 --> 00:14:54.079]  So I had enough money in my account, and I had contracts that were coming due in December, which is next month.
[00:14:55.103 --> 00:14:57.469]  Last Monday I get a telephone call.
[00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:02.039]  Again, the company I used to deal with was called Lindwaldach.
[00:15:03.294 --> 00:15:04.174]  Bypassed me.
[00:15:04.234 --> 00:15:07.876]  I never realized that they got bought out by MFGlobal.
[00:15:08.096 --> 00:15:09.236]  Didn't make any difference.
[00:15:09.516 --> 00:15:11.117]  Been dealing with them for years.
[00:15:11.737 --> 00:15:15.299]  I've been, as I said, I've been around commodities a long time.
[00:15:15.899 --> 00:15:18.260]  Nothing of this type ever happened.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.680]  So I get a call.
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.161]  I have a margin call.
[00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:25.843]  That means I don't have enough money in my account to support my goal positions.
[00:15:25.863 --> 00:15:27.864]  I said to the guy, what are you talking about?
[00:15:27.884 --> 00:15:29.764]  I'm taking delivery at the end of the month.
[00:15:29.784 --> 00:15:31.125]  I got a ton of money in my account.
[00:15:31.716 --> 00:15:33.638]  Oh no you don't, Mr. Salenti.
[00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.822]  The money has been taken out of your account.
[00:15:36.862 --> 00:15:38.023]  I said, who agreed to take the money?
[00:15:38.043 --> 00:15:38.984]  What are you talking about?
[00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:47.174]  He said, well, Lynn Waldock is owned by MF Global, and they decided, the CME Group and another party,
[00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:50.457]  That they're going to take the money and put it with a trustee.
[00:15:50.477 --> 00:16:06.573]  I said, oh yeah, you mean the Maya Lansky group and the Al Capone group decided to take all of my money out of my account and then ask me for a margin call to put in more money into a sinking ship?
[00:16:06.594 --> 00:16:08.115]  I said, what are you, out of your mind?
[00:16:09.178 --> 00:16:11.980]  I'm sorry Mr. Salenti, that's all we know.
[00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:17.664]  If you don't come up with more money, we're going to close your accounts.
[00:16:18.565 --> 00:16:19.506]  Your positions.
[00:16:20.306 --> 00:16:28.872]  So now Alex, they have my money, they closed my positions, and I can't get any of it.
[00:16:29.092 --> 00:16:30.854]  Now let's put this into perspective.
[00:16:31.857 --> 00:16:36.358]  The guy that was running this operation, John Corzine.
[00:16:36.858 --> 00:16:38.839]  Hey, where did John Corzine come from?
[00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:42.540]  Well, he's originally a Goldman Sachs guy.
[00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:45.841]  You know, one of those fine people out there.
[00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:50.202]  And then he became governor, senator of New Jersey.
[00:16:50.222 --> 00:16:51.662]  That wasn't good enough for him.
[00:16:52.462 --> 00:16:54.583]  Gave it to New Jersey really good.
[00:16:54.663 --> 00:16:57.964]  I'm gonna become... I'm gonna become governor.
[00:16:58.973 --> 00:17:01.634]  See, he becomes governor and senator in New Jersey.
[00:17:01.694 --> 00:17:03.315]  Runs that place into the ground.
[00:17:03.615 --> 00:17:10.179]  And by the way, Corzine, if you're listening, you know that car accident you got into a while ago and you almost died?
[00:17:10.199 --> 00:17:13.320]  You SOB, you should have died!
[00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.502]  Because you ruined a lot of people's lives.
[00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:19.284]  Stealing their money.
[00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.345]  You know what he was doing, Alex?
[00:17:22.543 --> 00:17:25.104]  Because he's connected with the boys!
[00:17:25.164 --> 00:17:28.726]  You know, they give him preferential treatment, trading rights.
[00:17:29.347 --> 00:17:32.748]  Oh, the guy that runs the Commodities Future Trading Commission?
[00:17:33.449 --> 00:17:34.830]  Gary Gensler!
[00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:36.591]  Gary Gensler!
[00:17:36.611 --> 00:17:42.614]  Hey, he gave CauseLine, I think, $10,000 for his campaign!
[00:17:43.414 --> 00:17:45.976]  It's a contribution, God be sure!
[00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:48.097]  Yeah, it's a bribe and a payoff!
[00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:55.105]  Gary Gensler runs the Commodities Future Trading Commission for the United States of America!
[00:17:55.125 --> 00:18:02.753]  And they let these guys get away with all these dirty deals as they're pulling them off and bringing everybody down.
[00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:08.680]  So now Corzine, he's going to play according to reports that I read.
[00:18:10.151 --> 00:18:21.195]  You go to Las Vegas over there, Alex, and you go put a dollar down on the table, and you say to the guy dealing the cards, that's not a dollar, that's $40!
[00:18:23.556 --> 00:18:26.036]  That's right, that's what the house said I could bet.
[00:18:26.477 --> 00:18:29.758]  Every dollar down, I can make a $40 bet.
[00:18:30.558 --> 00:18:31.879]  That's what he was doing.
[00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:35.640]  So now what happens is, brilliant
[00:18:36.735 --> 00:18:41.197]  Brilliant corzines betting on European bonds.
[00:18:41.657 --> 00:18:43.618]  You know what's going on in Europe.
[00:18:43.938 --> 00:18:46.179]  The bond market's going berserk.
[00:18:46.719 --> 00:18:51.961]  Italy's on the verge of going Greek, with the bonds hitting over 7%.
[00:18:54.437 --> 00:18:59.819]  You look at what's going on, he bet on Portuguese, Irish, all the losing bonds, Spain.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:08.983]  So now, the bet, in total, as I read it, it's about $40 billion that this guy's controlling.
[00:19:10.216 --> 00:19:15.198]  The shortfall that they can't find is $600 million.
[00:19:16.119 --> 00:19:23.742]  The CME group that runs the commodities game, they've come up and they said, we'll cover $300 million.
[00:19:24.482 --> 00:19:35.387]  So now we're talking about a $300 million shortfall out of a $40 billion pie, and they steal everybody's money out of their account.
[00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:38.066]  You tell me what's going on.
[00:19:38.446 --> 00:19:46.071]  Because my suspicion is they don't have the gold and silver to deliver.
[00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:46.672]  That's it.
[00:19:47.112 --> 00:19:51.975]  Well, that's what Max Keiser and you and many others predicted was that they were going to end up being short.
[00:19:52.415 --> 00:19:54.757]  But my God, the boldness of this.
[00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:08.096]  Iodine Protection Packs from HempUSA.org are now in stock for immediate delivery worldwide.
[00:20:08.377 --> 00:20:19.105]  Our Iodine Protection Packs include Micro Plant Powder, Green Life Kelp, Red Palm Oil, and our clear Roll-On Iodine that will feed the body the iodine it needs.

[00:20:30.874 --> 00:20:40.120]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.921]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:47.145]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:48.086]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:48.126 --> 00:20:51.248]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:20:51.388 --> 00:20:52.168]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:53.229]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:54.190]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:05.176]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[00:21:05.576 --> 00:21:06.817]  Everyone can feel it.
[00:21:07.077 --> 00:21:15.521]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[00:21:15.981 --> 00:21:19.163]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.283]  But take heart.
[00:21:20.303 --> 00:21:23.965]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:21:24.245 --> 00:21:29.228]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[00:21:29.648 --> 00:21:33.191]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:34.912]  The globalists are scared.
[00:21:35.212 --> 00:21:36.213]  They've overreached.
[00:21:36.553 --> 00:21:39.695]  The future of the info war is in your hands.

[00:24:01.707 --> 00:24:03.894]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:07.264]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:27.918 --> 00:24:29.958]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:24:30.018 --> 00:24:31.139]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:42.081]  You just heard six minutes from our lengthy 35-minute in-depth interview last night on InfoWars Nightly News at PrisonPlanet.TV with Gerald Cilente.
[00:24:42.621 --> 00:24:47.842]  Now we've learned more in just the last 14 hours or so since last night.
[00:24:48.683 --> 00:24:53.904]  Reuters is now reporting that the federal government regulator
[00:24:55.032 --> 00:25:02.576]  Involved in overseeing this as long ago as a few weeks ago, two and a half weeks ago, knew about all this and basically kept it quiet.
[00:25:03.397 --> 00:25:15.184]  But they went on to say, don't worry though, even though he's, quote, involved with John Corzine and involved with Goldman Sachs, who basically is using this as a front company, it's okay.
[00:25:15.224 --> 00:25:17.905]  His underlings can still carry out a good investigation.
[00:25:18.366 --> 00:25:21.888]  CFTC head didn't want to distract from MF
[00:25:22.714 --> 00:25:32.183]  Probe, the top US futures regulator, said he was not participating in the investigation of MF Global Holdings, the brokerage that filed for bankruptcy.
[00:25:32.663 --> 00:25:34.285]  So he would not become a distraction.
[00:25:34.725 --> 00:25:36.147]  And it goes on to say that...
[00:25:37.386 --> 00:25:43.328]  Gensler has had close ties with MF Global's former chief executive, John Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey.
[00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.449]  Both men worked at Goldman Sachs Group.
[00:25:45.889 --> 00:25:57.913]  And then it goes on to say that of the $900 million, it was $600 million last night, $900 million of customers' money out of cash accounts, not just gold accounts and other accounts, they say regular accounts, that was just taken, segregated accounts.
[00:25:59.053 --> 00:26:01.294]  I mean, they're making no bones about it.
[00:26:01.314 --> 00:26:03.855]  This is unprecedented to actually grab customer accounts.
[00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:14.693]  Now what they're doing is they're admitting, and we're going to go to Gerald Cilente on this, joining us via video Skype from New York at the Trends Research Center headquarters.
[00:26:14.713 --> 00:26:18.215]  I mean, I'm almost speechless right now.
[00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:19.136]  This is so incredible.
[00:26:20.417 --> 00:26:25.541]  They are now announcing that most of the money
[00:26:27.052 --> 00:26:35.698]  500 plus million of the 900 million was given to JP Morgan, and there's now an investigation of how they claim those bank accounts were theirs.
[00:26:36.459 --> 00:26:37.899]  And those brokerage accounts were theirs.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:44.444]  Gerald Cilente, I know you learned about this last week, but they didn't even explain what was happening.
[00:26:44.784 --> 00:26:46.865]  It came into focus just in the last 48 hours.
[00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:48.407]  Now we're learning more by the minute.
[00:26:48.707 --> 00:26:54.411]  What is the latest on your six-plus figures that's disappeared into a black hole?
[00:26:55.251 --> 00:26:59.534]  I just got off the phone with the broker, the account that they've taken it over to.
[00:26:59.554 --> 00:27:01.655]  The new brokerage firm.
[00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:03.296]  Zero.
[00:27:03.816 --> 00:27:05.157]  They know nothing.
[00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:12.149]  And of course, you know, a lot of people from NF Global have got, you know, MF'd by Corzine.
[00:27:12.189 --> 00:27:13.449]  They lost their jobs.
[00:27:13.889 --> 00:27:17.670]  So a few guys that were brought over are now with the new firm.
[00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:21.111]  And they can't tell me one thing.
[00:27:21.691 --> 00:27:25.892]  This is criminality, clear and simple.
[00:27:26.312 --> 00:27:27.853]  And you know, here's the rub, Alex.
[00:27:28.473 --> 00:27:35.356]  You get caught driving, you're like a fraction over that limit for alcohol.
[00:27:35.776 --> 00:27:38.478]  Boy, the goons put the handcuffs on you.
[00:27:38.858 --> 00:27:44.120]  Look how they rough up the kids in these Occupy Wall Street in Oakland scenes.
[00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:50.583]  But boy, oh boy, nobody touches the White Shoe Boys.
[00:27:51.123 --> 00:27:53.985]  And I want to say this, and I'm going to keep saying it.
[00:27:55.416 --> 00:28:12.596]  I am sick and tired of all these derogatory Italian shows that Sumner Redstone on Viacom puts out there like The Sopranos and Jersey Shore and all these other ones debasing my ethnicity.
[00:28:13.377 --> 00:28:16.799]  Why don't they go after the people on Wall Street?
[00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:19.961]  Why are they hands-off with them?
[00:28:20.561 --> 00:28:29.846]  Why are the biggest criminals walking the face of the earth that have robbed people's homes, foreclosed on them illegally?
[00:28:30.646 --> 00:28:34.348]  Have taken segregated funds and put them in their pockets.
[00:28:34.768 --> 00:28:37.189]  How come there's nothing about this?
[00:28:37.909 --> 00:28:45.053]  Why are the White Shoe Boys so sacrosanct that no one could talk about them?
[00:28:45.673 --> 00:28:47.134]  Only the Italians!
[00:28:47.694 --> 00:28:55.541]  If the Italians were doing this, some of the Redstone would be having a ball putting it on HBO.
[00:28:56.041 --> 00:28:58.183]  Why isn't Corzine in jail?
[00:28:58.543 --> 00:29:00.485]  Until we can straighten this out.
[00:29:01.786 --> 00:29:03.487]  Why do all of these groups?
[00:29:03.868 --> 00:29:04.568]  You look it up.
[00:29:04.929 --> 00:29:10.873]  Two weeks ago, three weeks ago, Citigroup is fined $285 million for doing dirty deals.
[00:29:15.177 --> 00:29:17.239]  Who was the CEO at the time?
[00:29:17.879 --> 00:29:19.460]  Charles Prince!
[00:29:20.141 --> 00:29:21.762]  A prince of a man!
[00:29:21.782 --> 00:29:23.243]  Oh no, he's not!
[00:29:23.524 --> 00:29:24.705]  He's not indicted!
[00:29:25.145 --> 00:29:26.926]  He's not brought into custody!
[00:29:27.447 --> 00:29:28.768]  He's not questioned!
[00:29:29.248 --> 00:29:33.752]  Only we get the screws when we just jaywalk!
[00:29:33.892 --> 00:29:37.335]  Gerald Filente, stay there, let's come back and get back into this.
[00:29:38.211 --> 00:29:45.355]  And talk about this above-the-law situation because they've got their operatives in every power position, regulatorily and in law enforcement.
[00:29:45.655 --> 00:29:47.136]  I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[00:29:47.156 --> 00:29:47.997]  They're gonna steal everything.
[00:29:48.257 --> 00:29:48.857]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:50.618 --> 00:29:51.519]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:53.620]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.222]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.752]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.952 --> 00:30:08.999]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.621]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:10.802 --> 00:30:19.593]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:20.314 --> 00:30:27.437]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:27.857 --> 00:30:35.480]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.782]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:04.746]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:05.066 --> 00:32:05.687]  Number one.
[00:32:05.987 --> 00:32:09.149]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.970]  Number two.
[00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.833]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.153 --> 00:32:15.613]  It's true.
[00:32:15.914 --> 00:32:20.457]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.757 --> 00:32:21.297]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.598 --> 00:32:24.880]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:28.903]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:29.103 --> 00:32:29.643]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.883 --> 00:32:32.265]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.645 --> 00:32:35.988]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:36.328 --> 00:32:41.029]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.249 --> 00:32:46.030]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:46.311 --> 00:32:50.332]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:50.492 --> 00:32:52.032]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:52.272 --> 00:32:56.873]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:13.373 --> 00:33:22.842]  By the way, if you go to Infowars.com, you can find our articles.
[00:33:22.902 --> 00:33:27.186]  Gerald Salente's gold account has been emptied by MF Global.
[00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:30.489]  That's the RT video and our interview with him last night.
[00:33:30.869 --> 00:33:32.391]  It did actually get up.
[00:33:33.396 --> 00:33:40.078]  I got posted a little bit quicker than I thought it would, so it's now up there and available if you want to see that in-depth interview.
[00:33:40.098 --> 00:33:42.980]  But we do have Gerald Cilente joining us live here.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:52.123]  And then, of course, we have our new top story by Paul Joseph Watson that accurately breaks down exactly what's happening here.
[00:33:52.843 --> 00:33:56.485]  And that's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:59.806]  We need to get this out to everybody on Twitter, everybody on Facebook.
[00:34:00.626 --> 00:34:00.866]  I think?
[00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:22.860]  We need more money.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.661]  Your account's empty for trading gold.
[00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:26.102]  He's like, but I've got an account.
[00:34:26.142 --> 00:34:27.603]  I'm taking delivery at the end of the month.
[00:34:27.643 --> 00:34:28.223]  It's my money.
[00:34:28.843 --> 00:34:29.784]  They go, I'm sorry.
[00:34:29.904 --> 00:34:30.565]  That's gone.
[00:34:31.705 --> 00:34:33.446]  Again, they don't call it apologizing.
[00:34:33.507 --> 00:34:35.268]  They know how to just throw it in your face.
[00:34:35.488 --> 00:34:38.610]  And they bought the company that he'd been trading with since the 70s.
[00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:40.151]  First time this has ever happened.
[00:34:40.571 --> 00:34:41.132]  This is important.
[00:34:41.152 --> 00:34:44.254]  It's not like he's some little old lady that didn't know what she was doing and this happened.
[00:34:45.034 --> 00:34:49.537]  This is going after people's personal accounts.
[00:34:49.597 --> 00:34:50.678]  This is raiding them.
[00:34:51.587 --> 00:34:55.669]  And here it is, MF Global looted customers' accounts via internal bank run.
[00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:57.409]  That's what this is.
[00:34:57.969 --> 00:35:02.791]  And now I'm reading over Reuters and others, it turns out it's other people's separate cash accounts.
[00:35:03.311 --> 00:35:09.494]  People that had cash accounts with them, even had credit cards attached to it, or debit cards, gone!
[00:35:10.494 --> 00:35:19.617]  900 million dollars, and it turns out the CFTC knew about this three weeks ago, and let them, let me just read you these headlines, we're going back to Gerald.
[00:35:20.118 --> 00:35:20.658]  Here's Reuters.
[00:35:22.139 --> 00:35:26.403]  CFTC, that's the federal agency, Commissioner views MF Global darkly.
[00:35:26.803 --> 00:35:29.166]  This is yesterday saying it looks like fraud, looks criminal.
[00:35:30.207 --> 00:35:31.708]  You know, the money is not where it should be.
[00:35:32.088 --> 00:35:33.490]  Something nefarious has happened.
[00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.391]  Potentially something illegal.
[00:35:35.992 --> 00:35:36.593]  Oh really?
[00:35:36.873 --> 00:35:38.835]  You're just now saying that as you get scared.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:47.006]  Continuing analysis, SEC targets low-level bankers, spares top execs, Reuters.
[00:35:47.566 --> 00:35:55.273]  Of course, we've always, they go after people who've done nothing, but if you steal the whole farm, it's fine because these mega companies put their people in as all the regulators.
[00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:58.256]  Purgatory for MF Global customers.
[00:35:58.616 --> 00:36:02.439]  Wall Street Journal, at least 33,000 account holders can't get their cash.
[00:36:02.779 --> 00:36:04.621]  My entire business has come to a halt.
[00:36:05.061 --> 00:36:06.303]  That's a quote, Wall Street Journal.
[00:36:07.369 --> 00:36:09.229]  They're grabbing cash, gold, everything.
[00:36:09.789 --> 00:36:12.730]  MF Global clients accuse JP Morgan of overreach and bankruptcy.
[00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:13.930]  And it goes on.
[00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.151]  500 plus million of the 900 million JP Morgan got.
[00:36:18.291 --> 00:36:19.611]  Oh, those accounts, we'll take those.
[00:36:19.631 --> 00:36:20.251]  Those are ours.
[00:36:21.032 --> 00:36:31.253]  CFTC head didn't want to distract from MF Global probe, because it turns out Gensler is, quote, heavily connected to John Corzine and Goldman Sachs, where they both came from.
[00:36:31.473 --> 00:36:32.734]  It's always Goldman Sachs.
[00:36:33.354 --> 00:36:33.894]  Continuing.
[00:36:34.574 --> 00:36:35.934]  Launches investigation.
[00:36:36.014 --> 00:36:40.856]  Now the CFTC launches an investigation to bankrupt MF Deal after the money's already been gotten out.
[00:36:41.336 --> 00:36:43.956]  Koch Brothers and MF Global, friends to the end.
[00:36:44.597 --> 00:36:45.157]  Here's another one.
[00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:48.438]  MF Global judge sets hearing on cash transfers.
[00:36:48.478 --> 00:36:50.138]  This is just out this morning.
[00:36:50.178 --> 00:37:02.061]  A federal bankruptcy judge scheduled a Thursday hearing on the request of the trustee overseeing the bankruptcy of MF Global Holdings, LTD's broker-dealer unit, and returned $520 million of cash to customers.
[00:37:04.619 --> 00:37:10.121]  So they're now meeting about the 520 of the 590 different articles that JP Morgan's got.
[00:37:11.841 --> 00:37:13.982]  And the hearing's set for later this afternoon.
[00:37:14.102 --> 00:37:14.942]  We'll go over all of this.
[00:37:14.962 --> 00:37:15.483]  Here's another one.
[00:37:15.663 --> 00:37:16.543]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:37:16.643 --> 00:37:23.325]  CME knew of MF Global fund shortfall before CFTC regulators.
[00:37:23.885 --> 00:37:24.286]  They knew!
[00:37:26.411 --> 00:37:29.794]  This is, break down why this happened and what this signifies.
[00:37:29.834 --> 00:37:32.356]  For me, you were getting into the heart of this.
[00:37:33.076 --> 00:37:35.278]  They arrest people for lemonade stands.
[00:37:35.318 --> 00:37:37.280]  Don't let people have organic cookouts.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.301]  They come and grab stuff.
[00:37:38.321 --> 00:37:41.443]  They're arresting Amish people in a year and a half.
[00:37:41.783 --> 00:37:43.024]  I keep saying a year, I've been corrected.
[00:37:43.044 --> 00:37:45.466]  A year and a half long, million dollar secret sting.
[00:37:45.647 --> 00:37:47.388]  When he was just publicly selling it to his neighbors.
[00:37:47.868 --> 00:37:51.111]  And the undercover cops begged him for months to sell them the whole milk.
[00:37:51.171 --> 00:37:52.432]  By the way, I got raw milk in my refrigerator.
[00:37:52.432 --> 00:37:52.813]  We're good to go.
[00:38:06.058 --> 00:38:10.679]  And I imagine you're... You're not ranting, you're putting a lot of pieces together that are very important.
[00:38:11.319 --> 00:38:19.161]  Especially the line from Gary Gensler, the Commodities Future Trading Commission head.
[00:38:19.701 --> 00:38:21.822]  He doesn't want to interfere!
[00:38:22.222 --> 00:38:26.323]  He's been shoveling money into Corzine's campaign fund.
[00:38:26.803 --> 00:38:32.364]  When the loser used to run New Jersey, Corzine, the former senator and governor,
[00:38:33.084 --> 00:38:35.326]  It's the Goldman Sachs gang!
[00:38:35.867 --> 00:38:37.849]  It's the Merrill Lynch mob!
[00:38:38.449 --> 00:38:40.371]  It's the Citigroup criminals!
[00:38:40.732 --> 00:38:42.533]  And I want to make this clear, Alex.
[00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:44.515]  I'm reading some of these comments.
[00:38:44.595 --> 00:38:46.577]  Oh, how stupid Solenti is.
[00:38:47.038 --> 00:38:52.483]  You know, he talks about having physical gold, and here he gets stung buying paper gold.
[00:38:52.943 --> 00:38:53.864]  No, idiots!
[00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.606]  It goes like this.
[00:38:57.027 --> 00:38:58.649]  I had a contract.
[00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:05.254]  The contract was an agreement that I would pick my gold up in December.
[00:39:06.414 --> 00:39:17.522]  They took my money out of my savings, out of my account with Lynn Waldock, and won't give me the money to buy the gold.
[00:39:17.882 --> 00:39:24.006]  That's like you going to any gold dealer, and I go to other gold dealers.
[00:39:24.267 --> 00:39:28.690]  For the record, I buy coins and I buy bullion.
[00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.632]  It's like calling up one of the ones like Kitco.
[00:39:33.233 --> 00:39:34.334]  That's everywhere.
[00:39:35.134 --> 00:39:40.496]  And sending them money for your gold, and they don't send it to you.
[00:39:40.896 --> 00:39:42.776]  It's as simple as that.
[00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:45.577]  So no, I'm not an imbecile.
[00:39:46.037 --> 00:39:48.698]  No, I wasn't buying paper gold.
[00:39:49.178 --> 00:39:53.219]  I had bought an agreement to deliver the gold in December.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.200]  Now hear this!
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.881]  You have money with Charles Schwab?
[00:39:57.681 --> 00:40:00.242]  You got your money in Wells Fargo?
[00:40:00.802 --> 00:40:03.424]  You got it with the Shitty Group Criminals?
[00:40:04.044 --> 00:40:08.726]  You trade with Fidelity or Raymond James?
[00:40:10.233 --> 00:40:15.095]  You have your money anywhere, they'll do the same thing to you.
[00:40:15.556 --> 00:40:17.096]  No, I'm not a dupe.
[00:40:17.537 --> 00:40:19.057]  No, I'm not a jerk.
[00:40:19.538 --> 00:40:24.160]  I've been robbed by the CauseLine criminal group.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:27.341]  Do you remember, Alex, when that guy
[00:40:28.642 --> 00:40:32.543]  Strauss-Kahn, you know the head of the IMF guy?
[00:40:32.923 --> 00:40:35.504]  The International Mafia Federation?
[00:40:35.904 --> 00:40:44.326]  When he was arrested in New York for allegedly forcing the maid to have oral sex with him?
[00:40:44.906 --> 00:40:49.987]  Do you remember the perp walk that those brave New York City cops
[00:40:50.467 --> 00:40:55.888]  Who are out there beating up little kids and grabbing them out of Occupy Wall Street.
[00:40:56.209 --> 00:41:02.430]  Do you remember when all those dick-tectives were arresting Khan?
[00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.831]  Where's the perp walk for Corzine?
[00:41:06.511 --> 00:41:08.352]  How come he doesn't get one?
[00:41:08.752 --> 00:41:17.114]  He screwed a lot more people than Dominique Strauss-Kahn could ever have a wet dream about.
[00:41:18.203 --> 00:41:20.104]  All right, Gerald, and I understand you're angry.
[00:41:20.124 --> 00:41:22.485]  You won't say, but it's well over six figures, well over $100,000.
[00:41:23.465 --> 00:41:32.569]  And I did see in the Infowars.com story posted on Drudge, DrudgeReport.com, that there were people in there snickering and laughing.
[00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:38.211]  Those are trolls that live in their mother's basement who don't understand commodities, who don't understand what's happening.
[00:41:39.011 --> 00:41:41.873]  I want to point something out, so just ignore them, it just gives them attention, that's what they love.
[00:41:42.173 --> 00:41:42.973]  Here's what's happening.
[00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:46.495]  People don't want to admit how late in the game it is.
[00:41:47.055 --> 00:42:00.042]  They don't want to admit they're setting up a banking dictatorship, in Time Magazine's own words, in Europe, out of the crisis, the very same Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citibank, Wells Fargo, same group, six big megabanks.
[00:42:00.462 --> 00:42:03.624]  They set all this up, they're doing it again.
[00:42:04.304 --> 00:42:06.604]  And they've already been stealing our money by devaluing it.
[00:42:06.885 --> 00:42:11.105]  They're already jacking up our taxes to pay more and more to them in banker bailouts.
[00:42:11.866 --> 00:42:19.187]  They're already doing this, and you are taking physical delivery of gold you have paid for, and they literally grab your account.
[00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:22.888]  Even Reuters, Bloomberg, and Forbes, they admit.
[00:42:24.128 --> 00:42:28.429]  Even the federal agency, the CFTC,
[00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:33.622]  Says this is illegal and they've grabbed people's personal accounts.
[00:42:33.662 --> 00:42:35.725]  This is never done in bankruptcy.
[00:42:35.885 --> 00:42:38.048]  How come Corzine isn't in jail?
[00:42:38.609 --> 00:42:40.732]  What makes him better than everybody else?
[00:42:41.513 --> 00:42:43.776]  How come they're not doing a perp walk with him?
[00:42:44.878 --> 00:42:48.061]  And that's what my anger is about, besides stealing my money.
[00:42:48.361 --> 00:42:51.183]  As I said, look at all the lives that this guy's ruined.
[00:42:51.603 --> 00:42:54.045]  I had friends that all lost their jobs.
[00:42:55.046 --> 00:42:57.989]  The people that you were reading about have lost their businesses.
[00:42:58.789 --> 00:43:01.131]  And you're talking about what's going on in Europe.
[00:43:01.551 --> 00:43:02.933]  Let's get this straight.
[00:43:03.353 --> 00:43:04.434]  It's fascism.
[00:43:04.854 --> 00:43:09.478]  The top of the corporate line, the bankers, have taken over.
[00:43:10.078 --> 00:43:12.781]  Super Mario, they call the guy in Italy.
[00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:15.042]  Super Mario Monty.
[00:43:15.163 --> 00:43:16.584]  Three-card Monty.
[00:43:16.884 --> 00:43:18.525]  He's running the show now.
[00:43:18.926 --> 00:43:19.987]  Where is he from?
[00:43:20.687 --> 00:43:24.811]  He was the European head of the Trilateral Commission.
[00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:25.891]  That's right.
[00:43:26.292 --> 00:43:27.633]  Go to Wikipedia.
[00:43:27.953 --> 00:43:28.974]  It's right there.
[00:43:29.534 --> 00:43:32.177]  Oh, he's an international advisor, too.
[00:43:32.197 --> 00:43:34.519]  Oh, this is gonna shock you, Alex.
[00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:36.420]  Goldman Sachs.
[00:43:36.961 --> 00:43:37.101]  Oh!
[00:43:37.441 --> 00:43:40.223]  Look at the guy that they put in over there in Greece.
[00:43:40.903 --> 00:43:41.784]  The same thing.
[00:43:41.804 --> 00:43:43.085]  Goldman Sachs.
[00:43:43.145 --> 00:43:44.726]  A former vice president.
[00:43:44.826 --> 00:43:49.809]  Argentina, Costa Rica, New Zealand, Australia, England, Germany, France.
[00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.091]  Every country's run by Goldman Sachs.
[00:43:52.511 --> 00:43:53.552]  Every major company.
[00:43:54.373 --> 00:43:55.353]  Goldman Sachs.
[00:43:55.954 --> 00:43:57.275]  Government Sachs.
[00:43:57.875 --> 00:44:00.137]  That's what we're all under the thumb of.
[00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:02.618]  Hey, Murray Rothstein.
[00:44:03.059 --> 00:44:05.480]  Over there at, what's your name, Redstone.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.001]  That's it.
[00:44:06.921 --> 00:44:08.223]  Sum the Redstone!
[00:44:08.743 --> 00:44:12.528]  Let's do a deal on the Wall Street Mob!
[00:44:12.908 --> 00:44:16.913]  I'm sick and tired of you going after Italians!
[00:44:17.453 --> 00:44:21.638]  And if you have a problem with it, Murray, come over and visit me!
[00:44:22.038 --> 00:44:24.701]  We could talk about it man to man!
[00:44:27.096 --> 00:44:28.857]  Gerald, again, we need you.
[00:44:29.157 --> 00:44:30.737]  I've never seen you this angry.
[00:44:30.797 --> 00:44:31.858]  You're going to get your money back.
[00:44:32.698 --> 00:44:34.699]  I don't know if I'm getting my money back.
[00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:39.841]  I just talked to my broker over there, and they don't know if I'm getting my money back.
[00:44:40.181 --> 00:44:42.042]  And they've been holding it for two weeks.
[00:44:42.622 --> 00:44:46.303]  I want to see a perp walk for Corazon.
[00:44:46.363 --> 00:44:46.803]  Exactly.
[00:44:46.864 --> 00:44:47.844]  That's what I want to see.
[00:44:47.884 --> 00:44:48.324]  Exactly.
[00:44:48.344 --> 00:44:50.945]  But let me just stop you right there, because this goes to the heart of the matter.
[00:44:50.965 --> 00:44:52.886]  This is what I'm asking you right now.
[00:44:52.906 --> 00:44:53.726]  This is the key.
[00:44:54.226 --> 00:44:55.487]  This is the key I'm asking you.
[00:44:57.147 --> 00:45:04.009]  Yes, Goldman Sachs and the other five big banks and a few subsidiaries, they literally can get away with anything now.
[00:45:04.369 --> 00:45:06.030]  They've got both parties' leadership.
[00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:07.310]  They've got all the regulators.
[00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.971]  That's admitted right here in the news.
[00:45:09.531 --> 00:45:16.793]  They, 12 years ago, took all the veterans' death benefits, and as they die, they let the widow know, sorry, we're not paying you.
[00:45:17.113 --> 00:45:18.233]  Government says we can steal.
[00:45:18.773 --> 00:45:23.194]  You know, you might have put in hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years when your husband was in the military 25 years.
[00:45:23.494 --> 00:45:24.815]  You don't get it, okay?
[00:45:25.595 --> 00:45:29.717]  So my issue is, won't this totally destroy confidence?
[00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:32.779]  Because they're certainly trying to keep the lid on this right now.
[00:45:32.839 --> 00:45:35.080]  It's not getting the attention it should, but it's starting to come out.
[00:45:35.681 --> 00:45:47.767]  Won't this totally destroy confidence when we learn that it doesn't matter if it's stocks, bonds, portfolios, physical gold, bank accounts, safety deposit boxes, they will take it.
[00:45:47.827 --> 00:45:48.988]  They will take it all.
[00:45:49.468 --> 00:45:53.090]  And they're now admitting this signals an even bigger collapse than 2008.
[00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:54.691]  We can see it all happening.
[00:45:55.091 --> 00:45:56.892]  How much do they think they can get away with?
[00:45:57.212 --> 00:45:59.433]  How much do they think the cops will carry out for them?
[00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:01.634]  When the cops' families are going to lose everything.
[00:46:01.854 --> 00:46:03.695]  When the cops are going to lose their pension funds.
[00:46:04.055 --> 00:46:04.955]  It's already happening.
[00:46:05.255 --> 00:46:08.477]  I mean, how do they think they're going to get away with this?
[00:46:08.797 --> 00:46:11.798]  Or are they just so greedy, they don't care.
[00:46:12.278 --> 00:46:16.160]  They're basically like cancer destroying the body that it lives in.
[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.280]  I mean, that's my question.
[00:46:18.081 --> 00:46:21.062]  Couldn't this trigger, because a lot of people I know, and I was already doing this,
[00:46:21.542 --> 00:46:23.823]  I'd already been warning about this lately because I feel it in my gut.
[00:46:24.083 --> 00:46:24.884]  You've been warning about it.
[00:46:25.304 --> 00:46:32.307]  I know a lot of people now who are already getting everything out of the banks and out of the stock market and out of everything.
[00:46:32.627 --> 00:46:37.729]  What are these parasites going to do when people all start pulling their money out of the system?
[00:46:37.789 --> 00:46:47.674]  I mean, that doesn't send confidence when the inside banksters and the big commodity houses buy up companies that you're working with and steal your money and then just say,
[00:46:48.314 --> 00:46:49.635]  You know, that's the way it is.
[00:46:50.075 --> 00:46:51.815]  You just need to go ahead and accept it.
[00:46:52.176 --> 00:46:59.238]  Won't that force people to pull their money out of the system when they learn the insiders are already engaged in internal bank runs?
[00:46:59.919 --> 00:47:01.499]  Of course, and that's what they're doing.
[00:47:01.579 --> 00:47:03.240]  So what do the fascists do?
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.281]  They come up with a new line.
[00:47:05.701 --> 00:47:06.241]  I got it.
[00:47:06.541 --> 00:47:08.602]  We'll call it Austerity Measures.
[00:47:09.182 --> 00:47:19.684]  And what they'll do is they'll send a false flag out there, blame it on somebody else, and say that because of these difficult times, we have to impose austerity measures.
[00:47:20.044 --> 00:47:21.505]  We're already living under them!
[00:47:22.045 --> 00:47:22.525]  Hey, you look!
[00:47:22.885 --> 00:47:25.025]  Remember when real estate prices were going up?
[00:47:25.485 --> 00:47:30.366]  They'd raise your real estate taxes, because real estate prices were going up.
[00:47:30.846 --> 00:47:33.667]  Now real estate prices are down in the tubes!
[00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:36.168]  You know, land has gone down, what, some 70%!
[00:47:38.428 --> 00:47:39.229]  And what do they do?
[00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:41.890]  They raise your taxes on real estate!
[00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.811]  They raise your school taxes!
[00:47:44.171 --> 00:47:46.552]  They raise every tax across the board!
[00:47:46.913 --> 00:47:49.194]  So yes, do they have a conscience?
[00:47:49.594 --> 00:47:50.775]  Do they understand?
[00:47:50.795 --> 00:47:52.796]  They're money junkies!
[00:47:53.556 --> 00:47:55.236]  Just like a heroin addict!
[00:47:55.537 --> 00:47:57.717]  They have no bounds or boundaries!
[00:47:58.017 --> 00:47:58.837]  They need more!
[00:47:58.897 --> 00:47:59.738]  They need more!
[00:47:59.998 --> 00:48:02.878]  And they will do anything to get it, and they're doing it!
[00:48:03.158 --> 00:48:04.359]  They're starting wars!
[00:48:04.679 --> 00:48:05.939]  Look what they've done in Libya!
[00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:07.819]  Look what's going on around the world!
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:11.040]  They are going- They're- Take that- I've said this from the beginning.
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:16.241]  When they first bailed out on the- The Goldman Sachs guy over there!
[00:48:16.742 --> 00:48:18.762]  Frankenstein Paulson!
[00:48:19.022 --> 00:48:19.722]  Remember him?
[00:48:19.862 --> 00:48:20.463]  Our U.S.
[00:48:20.543 --> 00:48:21.863]  Treasury Secretary?
[00:48:22.563 --> 00:48:25.444]  The guy was the former CEO of Goldman Sachs.
[00:48:25.784 --> 00:48:27.265]  Remember the TARP one?
[00:48:27.745 --> 00:48:29.206]  Yeah, TARP all right.
[00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:33.767]  They took our money, gave it to Goldman Sachs for making a bad bet with AIG.
[00:48:33.947 --> 00:48:39.449]  And I have the clip, Gerald, I have some breaking news here I want your take on that's in Obama deception and fall of the republic that you're in.
[00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:48.093]  He actually says to him in there, Congressman Stern from Florida says, how did you give yourself two hundred something million of the bailout money?
[00:48:48.433 --> 00:48:49.333]  And he said, I got a waiver.
[00:48:49.373 --> 00:48:50.354]  He goes, who gave you the waiver?
[00:48:50.574 --> 00:48:50.914]  I did.
[00:48:51.798 --> 00:48:56.561]  I mean, literally, Paulson said, I gave myself a waiver to give myself the citizens' money.
[00:48:56.761 --> 00:48:57.722]  Now, let's stop right there.
[00:48:57.902 --> 00:48:58.823]  This is breaking, Gerald.
[00:48:59.023 --> 00:49:00.644]  This just came out 10 minutes ago.
[00:49:00.724 --> 00:49:02.685]  Jarron just found it, scanning.
[00:49:02.825 --> 00:49:07.088]  MF Global Brokerage Trustee to return some customer money.
[00:49:07.148 --> 00:49:08.849]  But guess why they say it's happening?
[00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.812]  They say it's already screwing up the stock market and the commodities.
[00:49:12.892 --> 00:49:21.338]  No one globally now, within 24 hours that this broke, I think because you finally pushed it out there, now they are announcing
[00:49:22.518 --> 00:49:28.581]  That it's affecting global trading in futures all over the world by shaking public confidence.
[00:49:28.902 --> 00:49:29.602]  That's a quote.
[00:49:29.862 --> 00:49:35.545]  So what we were just talking about is now happening and they're panicking and they're saying, okay, we'll give you your money back.
[00:49:35.585 --> 00:49:39.367]  We tried to take it, but don't keep everybody from pulling their money out.
[00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:44.351]  Alex, the global system is collapsing.
[00:49:45.131 --> 00:49:52.094]  The fascist bankers that they just brought in to solve the problems and the prostitutes calling them technocrats.
[00:49:52.594 --> 00:49:53.774]  Yeah, technocrat.
[00:49:53.794 --> 00:49:54.894]  You know what a technocrat is?
[00:49:55.255 --> 00:49:59.456]  That's a bureaucrat that knows how to use a computer to cook the books.
[00:50:00.296 --> 00:50:03.137]  These are the brilliant economists, yeah.
[00:50:03.577 --> 00:50:05.298]  They're not going to save the day.
[00:50:05.538 --> 00:50:08.219]  You look at where bond yields are going in Europe.
[00:50:08.439 --> 00:50:09.860]  They're going through the roof.
[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.600]  There's no saving it.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.201]  The system is in collapse.
[00:50:13.641 --> 00:50:15.442]  And as I said yesterday,
[00:50:16.142 --> 00:50:23.807]  Why do you think we heard all those stories about people taking their money and putting it under the mattress?
[00:50:24.628 --> 00:50:26.749]  Because they'll rob it from you.
[00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:32.753]  And let's stop this proper language of calling them bankers.
[00:50:33.214 --> 00:50:34.555]  They're loan sharks.
[00:50:34.935 --> 00:50:35.695]  That's all they are.
[00:50:36.696 --> 00:50:37.656]  And that's what this is.
[00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:44.779]  And the loan sharks will do anything to take your money so they don't take any loss.
[00:50:44.799 --> 00:50:45.559]  Gerald, stay there.
[00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:47.120]  Do just a couple more segments with us.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.040]  I know you've got to go.
[00:50:48.581 --> 00:50:49.041]  We'll understand.
[00:50:49.061 --> 00:50:50.021]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:52.002]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[00:50:52.022 --> 00:50:53.923]  We'll give you his website and more on the other side.
[00:50:54.943 --> 00:50:55.343]  Wow!
[00:50:55.403 --> 00:50:59.925]  They have stolen more than six figures from him and it's causing the markets to begin a meltdown.
[00:51:01.263 --> 00:51:05.849]  With new financial dominoes falling each day, do you know who really runs this country?
[00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.774]  This is Alex Jones with a special message about the gangster economy.
[00:51:10.055 --> 00:51:16.203]  Folks, if you're lucky enough to have a little money set aside for a rainy day, this could be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:51:16.223 --> 00:51:16.864]  We're good.
[00:51:39.825 --> 00:51:43.449]  Learn ingenious ways to profit in the new gangster economy.
[00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.632]  To read more about this amazing new book, don't wait.
[00:51:46.853 --> 00:51:48.635]  Go to gangster economy dot com.

[00:52:01.027 --> 00:52:05.909]  With the economic bad news getting worse each day, are you ready for the hard times ahead?
[00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:09.130]  This is Alex Jones with a special self-reliance report.
[00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:22.816]  I've said on this program before that studies show that in a true crisis, 8 out of 10 people will remain sheep-like and passive, frozen like deer in headlights of an oncoming car, waiting for others for help.
[00:52:23.336 --> 00:52:27.698]  1 out of 10 will actually panic and endanger family and friends as they melt down.
[00:52:28.238 --> 00:52:36.441]  And only one out of ten will take swift and decisive action when the going gets tough, dramatically increasing their chances of survival.
[00:52:36.661 --> 00:52:39.402]  Folks, I've just read a new book called Ready for Anything.
[00:52:39.662 --> 00:52:45.144]  It's a must-read for anyone who wants to increase their chances of survival in the coming hard times ahead.

[00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:29.169]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and recleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[00:54:20.592 --> 00:54:21.193]  Okay, folks.
[00:54:21.493 --> 00:54:22.733]  Here is the deal.
[00:54:23.033 --> 00:54:26.414]  Gerald Cilente has graciously agreed to be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[00:54:26.434 --> 00:54:30.075]  We're going to take a few phone calls with him in that last segment.
[00:54:30.455 --> 00:54:32.415]  Quick comments or questions for Gerald Cilente.
[00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:32.475]  800-259-9231.
[00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:38.854]  I need to put a plug in here.
[00:54:39.295 --> 00:54:46.517]  We are offering until Christmas all 18 of my films on DVD for $99.95.
[00:54:46.677 --> 00:54:47.797]  That's a $260 discount.
[00:54:47.817 --> 00:54:48.657]  And it's just an amazing deal.
[00:54:48.677 --> 00:54:49.418]  You can shop for 17 people.
[00:54:57.965 --> 00:55:00.748]  A couple of the DVDs have, you know, multiple DVDs in the pack.
[00:55:01.428 --> 00:55:07.934]  But you can shop for 15, 16, 17 people at one fell swoop and support our broadcast and get the word out.
[00:55:08.415 --> 00:55:09.716]  InfoWars.com.
[00:55:10.036 --> 00:55:13.319]  You can watch the films yourself, make copies of them, give them to people for stocking stuffers.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.141]  I just want to get the information out.
[00:55:15.161 --> 00:55:16.823]  It comes with bumper stickers, that is some rule book.
[00:55:17.719 --> 00:55:22.502]  And of course, the music of Terror Storm and Endgame with a bunch of my rants on the CD.
[00:55:23.062 --> 00:55:26.224]  It's just an amazing deal, 9995infowars.com.
[00:55:26.544 --> 00:55:34.949]  Don't forget, until the end of the month we're running a 15-day free trial for PrisonPlanet.tv and today we're launching two new specials.
[00:55:35.529 --> 00:55:36.310]  We have 44% off the Patriot.
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:44.385]  Where you can now get an entire year instead of $71.40 for $39.95.
[00:55:44.766 --> 00:55:47.869]  That's called The Patriot at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:55:47.969 --> 00:55:55.376]  All my films, my book, the higher quality podcast, my weeknight TV show, the daily radio show, all of it.
[00:55:56.482 --> 00:55:58.323]  That's all at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:55:58.343 --> 00:56:00.965]  We only offer this in the month of November and December every year.
[00:56:01.065 --> 00:56:02.165]  It's the Patriot, $39.95 instead of $71.40.
[00:56:02.205 --> 00:56:07.828]  Or get the Info Warrior, 70% off, normally $430, now $129 a year membership and all 18 of my films that are on DVD for $129.95.
[00:56:08.449 --> 00:56:10.210]  That's what also funds this truly alternative media system.
[00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.570]  We're not like
[00:56:23.752 --> 00:56:28.378]  JPMorgan that just goes into MF Global and takes your bank account.
[00:56:28.398 --> 00:56:30.200]  You actually support us if you believe in us.
[00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:35.266]  Speaking of Gerald Salente, Gerald, I hope the Trench Journal can continue after they've robbed you.
[00:56:36.428 --> 00:56:37.489]  Incredible information.
[00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:39.351]  How do folks subscribe over at the Trench Journal?
[00:56:39.932 --> 00:56:41.214]  TransJournal.com.
[00:56:41.394 --> 00:56:42.435]  That's the easiest way to go.
[00:56:42.495 --> 00:56:43.677]  TransJournal.com.
[00:56:44.357 --> 00:56:59.135]  And actually, you know, I urge everyone out there to get your CDs because when you see what you said long before anyone else did, particularly in the Obama deception, which I'm so familiar with,
[00:56:59.913 --> 00:57:04.799]  Everybody will think twice when they vote this coming November.
[00:57:05.139 --> 00:57:07.202]  Because we really don't have a choice.
[00:57:07.783 --> 00:57:10.426]  It's, you know, they talk about this guy, you know, this guy Romney.
[00:57:10.766 --> 00:57:11.547]  You know, Mittens.
[00:57:11.647 --> 00:57:12.909]  Mittens Romney over there.
[00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.911]  The tough guy who wants to go to war all the time.
[00:57:15.272 --> 00:57:17.634]  That was hiding in France during the Vietnam War.
[00:57:18.035 --> 00:57:18.696]  You know, trying to...
[00:57:18.976 --> 00:57:29.915]  Petal Mormonism to the almost all-Catholic, wine-drinking, cigarette-smoking, coffee-drinking, Brigitte Bardot-loving French.
[00:57:30.276 --> 00:57:31.037]  That mittens!
[00:57:32.253 --> 00:57:36.955]  He's now, you know, this guy is the kind of guy that's a Corzine character.
[00:57:37.535 --> 00:57:40.077]  You know, he talks about creating jobs.
[00:57:40.497 --> 00:57:43.678]  He's just one of these hedge fund guys with Bain Capital.
[00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:46.460]  They don't create jobs, they destroy them.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:55.624]  They buy up companies, pull out the money they can, get multi-millions from it, become, you know, half a billionaires.
[00:57:56.184 --> 00:57:59.709]  And then everybody loses their job as they walk away.
[00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:10.263]  So when you look at the Obama deception, when you look at your other pieces of work, you better unite for a cause that has morality.
[00:58:11.264 --> 00:58:13.104]  And that's what you're doing, Alex.
[00:58:13.505 --> 00:58:21.887]  You're telling the truth out there and uncovering these criminal activities like no one else is doing in the media.
[00:58:22.347 --> 00:58:29.589]  So everyone out there that if you want to live free before you die, you better come up with a little bit of cash.
[00:58:29.989 --> 00:58:31.969]  Do something positive for Christmas.
[00:58:32.009 --> 00:58:32.589]  Gerald, you're awesome.
[00:58:32.609 --> 00:58:33.409]  We're back in one minute.
[00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:36.690]  I want to get into how the global meltdown is going to take place.
[00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.811]  Phone calls and more with Gerald Cilenti.
[00:58:44.054 --> 00:58:47.815]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.216 --> 00:58:52.357]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:52.377 --> 00:58:59.059]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:59.319 --> 00:59:01.620]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:07.061]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:07.241 --> 00:59:10.022]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:10.282 --> 00:59:12.343]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.603 --> 00:59:18.527]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.848 --> 00:59:22.050]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:27.754]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:28.014 --> 00:59:29.315]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.655 --> 00:59:30.876]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.956 --> 00:59:33.498]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.618 --> 00:59:37.681]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:40.463]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:59:40.623 --> 00:59:42.324]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:42.444 --> 00:59:43.445]  That's End of America.
[00:59:43.585 --> 00:59:44.886]  The number 3.com.

[00:59:54.091 --> 00:59:56.033]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.493 --> 00:59:59.275]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.919 --> 01:00:10.104]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.765 --> 01:00:11.566]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.347 --> 01:00:13.209]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:17.554]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:22.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.041 --> 01:00:25.622]  Gerald Cilente for another 20 minutes is our guest.
[01:00:25.662 --> 01:00:29.884]  TrendsResearch.com for the daily updates and also if you want to subscribe.
[01:00:29.984 --> 01:00:31.865]  Really invaluable information.
[01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:34.606]  Top Trends Forecaster, Gerald Cilente.
[01:00:34.626 --> 01:00:36.127]  Well, this is a short 5-minute segment.
[01:00:36.147 --> 01:00:39.408]  A little 12-minute segment coming up with your calls after this quick break.
[01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:40.809]  Gerald...
[01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:51.215]  Bank of America, as you know, three weeks ago, four weeks ago, said, we're moving our 79 trillion in derivatives that are bad over into an area that's going to be taxpayer backed.
[01:00:51.235 --> 01:00:52.456]  So that's another way they rob us.
[01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:57.980]  But now, as you mentioned, these hedge funds go in, buy up companies, steal the pension funds, the employees, whatever.
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.323]  Now they're just grabbing people's bank accounts of brokerage firms they take over.
[01:01:03.183 --> 01:01:06.105]  I mean, as you said, why aren't they getting in trouble?
[01:01:06.426 --> 01:01:09.428]  And I think as they get away with more and more incredible things,
[01:01:10.308 --> 01:01:12.109]  That that only encourages the others.
[01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.970]  I mean, how far will they go?
[01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:15.891]  Where do you see this ending?
[01:01:16.832 --> 01:01:19.053]  Well, the system is collapsing, as I said.
[01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:20.754]  I really want to warn everyone.
[01:01:21.474 --> 01:01:24.976]  I don't care who your money is with, whatever kind of account you have.
[01:01:25.657 --> 01:01:31.080]  Savings account, checking account, a stock account, and I'll name the names.
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.223]  Whether it's with Charles Schwab, you know that friendly looking guy.
[01:01:37.003 --> 01:01:39.024]  Or Mr. Raymond James?
[01:01:39.605 --> 01:01:40.885]  Or with ETFs?
[01:01:41.746 --> 01:01:43.887]  Or with Fidelity?
[01:01:44.308 --> 01:01:44.988]  Fidelity?
[01:01:45.348 --> 01:01:48.550]  When they crash, you're gonna see some good infidelity.
[01:01:49.331 --> 01:02:00.257]  They're going to screw you at any level they can, and they'll do whatever they can, if this system continues to collapse in the rate that it is.
[01:02:00.658 --> 01:02:03.599]  There's a panic over in Europe.
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.220]  Here's the deal.
[01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:16.304]  The French and German banks are heavily loaded with these worthless Italian, Greek, and other bonds.
[01:02:16.784 --> 01:02:18.565]  So too with other countries.
[01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:23.006]  Hungary right now is going through a panic.
[01:02:23.586 --> 01:02:28.667]  You're looking at one country after another that's beginning to fail.
[01:02:29.048 --> 01:02:30.168]  So here's what they do.
[01:02:31.482 --> 01:02:36.684]  They bring in now, they're bringing in those so-called technocrats to build confidence.
[01:02:37.544 --> 01:02:39.505]  Think of the word confidence.
[01:02:40.545 --> 01:02:41.426]  Con men.
[01:02:42.086 --> 01:02:43.346]  Confidence game.
[01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.207]  Con.
[01:02:45.807 --> 01:02:47.208]  That's all it is.
[01:02:47.728 --> 01:02:49.529]  The system is collapsing.
[01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:55.151]  I'm warning everyone to use your own good judgment.
[01:02:56.084 --> 01:03:07.786]  And understand why you heard over and over again that people used to take the money out of the banks and put it under the mattress.
[01:03:08.426 --> 01:03:15.688]  Because they're going to steal it in other forms just as they stole it from me.
[01:03:16.248 --> 01:03:21.189]  And then you have a clown like Gary Gensler
[01:03:21.869 --> 01:03:46.681]  Who is the head of the Commodities Future Trading Commission that's supposed to be the watchdog over the CME group to make sure that companies like MF aren't taking your money out of segregated funds saying, oh I don't want to get involved in it now, oh no no, because you know it may disrupt things.
[01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:49.042]  Hey Gary, where were you before?
[01:03:50.503 --> 01:03:52.424]  You know, who are they kidding over here?
[01:03:52.764 --> 01:03:55.946]  The whole thing is a game that's rigged by Wall Street.
[01:03:56.347 --> 01:03:57.367]  Look at the names.
[01:03:57.808 --> 01:04:01.110]  Who was the Treasury Secretary under Clinton?
[01:04:02.216 --> 01:04:02.616]  Rubin!
[01:04:02.656 --> 01:04:03.097]  Rubin!
[01:04:03.577 --> 01:04:04.397]  Where was he from?
[01:04:04.817 --> 01:04:05.978]  Hey, Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:06.558 --> 01:04:07.859]  Who's the one under Clinton?
[01:04:08.479 --> 01:04:10.220]  Oh, I mean under Bush.
[01:04:10.761 --> 01:04:12.081]  It was, oh, Henry Paulson.
[01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:12.962]  Where was he from?
[01:04:13.042 --> 01:04:13.762]  Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:14.003 --> 01:04:15.023]  Where's Gensler from?
[01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:15.723]  Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:15.944 --> 01:04:17.084]  Where's Corzine from?
[01:04:17.144 --> 01:04:17.905]  Goldman Sachs.
[01:04:18.325 --> 01:04:24.909]  Mr. Sollenti, are you inferring that there's a connection between criminality and Goldman Sachs?
[01:04:25.409 --> 01:04:26.429]  Oh, no, no.
[01:04:26.890 --> 01:04:28.090]  No, they're wonderful people.
[01:04:28.591 --> 01:04:29.171]  After all,
[01:04:29.571 --> 01:04:35.315]  Lloyd Blankfein, I heard him say with my own two ears, he's doing God's work.
[01:04:35.836 --> 01:04:40.479]  Boy, I'll tell you, God's playing a dirty trick if he's doing God's work.
[01:04:40.499 --> 01:04:43.241]  Well, he's talking about Beelzebub, not the God we worship.
[01:04:43.281 --> 01:04:44.562]  I know, I know.
[01:04:44.742 --> 01:04:45.843]  Yeah, he's doing Satan's work.
[01:04:46.303 --> 01:04:46.684]  Stay there.
[01:04:46.724 --> 01:04:47.584]  Let's come back then.
[01:04:48.045 --> 01:04:48.405]  Stay there.
[01:04:48.445 --> 01:04:49.706]  Final segment with Gerald Cilente.
[01:04:50.406 --> 01:04:52.408]  Finish up with this information straight ahead.
[01:04:52.448 --> 01:04:52.908]  Amazing.
[01:04:53.609 --> 01:04:54.189]  What's going on?
[01:04:54.209 --> 01:04:54.770]  What's happening?
[01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:56.451]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:04:56.491 --> 01:04:57.191]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:57.211 --> 01:04:57.632]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:06.687]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:07.027 --> 01:05:15.149]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:05:15.889 --> 01:05:19.930]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:31.332]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:05:31.972 --> 01:05:40.995]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:41.495 --> 01:05:46.557]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:54.100]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.821]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:06:02.395 --> 01:06:05.978]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:06:06.398 --> 01:06:09.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.424]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:06:14.444 --> 01:06:20.648]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:06:20.828 --> 01:06:23.070]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.810]  Tim Geithner?
[01:06:23.830 --> 01:06:24.010]  Bernanke?
[01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:24.431]  They're arsonists!
[01:06:24.451 --> 01:06:25.091]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:06:25.151 --> 01:06:26.813]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:06:42.506 --> 01:06:44.327]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:06:44.347 --> 01:06:49.469]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:58.973]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:02.239 --> 01:07:06.523]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:07:06.943 --> 01:07:12.808]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:15.130]  Number one, study the past.
[01:07:15.651 --> 01:07:17.412]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:21.776]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:07:22.887 --> 01:07:25.169]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:29.253]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:07:29.814 --> 01:07:34.558]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:07:34.879 --> 01:07:38.322]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:07:38.883 --> 01:07:41.745]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:07:42.286 --> 01:07:45.929]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:46.750 --> 01:07:51.012]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:07:51.692 --> 01:07:55.814]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:56.315 --> 01:07:59.096]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:07.200]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.665 --> 01:08:12.788]  Okay, I want to go to your phone calls here for Gerald Cilente.
[01:08:12.808 --> 01:08:14.989]  Quick questions, quick comments, quick answers from him.
[01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:19.573]  But I wanted to bring up something that he mentioned last night on InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:08:20.234 --> 01:08:22.556]  By the way, that whole thing is now posted in the article.
[01:08:22.976 --> 01:08:26.579]  MF Global Looted Customer's Accounts via Internal Bank Run.
[01:08:27.039 --> 01:08:29.321]  If you want to find that video, it's at the bottom of the article.
[01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:33.405]  The video itself is titled, Zombie Banks Drain Cilente's Account.
[01:08:34.085 --> 01:08:34.285]  I think?
[01:08:53.553 --> 01:08:54.294]  I really don't.
[01:09:13.432 --> 01:09:17.376]  I don't think they have the gall to give out.
[01:09:17.917 --> 01:09:31.992]  And I've also heard, and I don't know if this is a fact, but I've heard this before, that for example with ETFs, the GLD, it's supposed to be being held by HSBC in their vaults.
[01:09:32.592 --> 01:09:38.795]  And I've heard that HSBC is one of the biggest shorts, taking the biggest short positions on gold.
[01:09:39.195 --> 01:09:44.658]  So in other words, they're supposed to be holding gold, but they're betting that the prices are going to go down.
[01:09:44.998 --> 01:09:55.403]  And this is important, Alex, because when I say take your money out of the banks, and why they put it in the mattress, I'm not saying to keep it in that phony paper money.
[01:09:56.003 --> 01:09:58.444]  For me, I'm not giving anyone advice.
[01:09:58.904 --> 01:09:59.325]  For me,
[01:10:00.225 --> 01:10:02.587]  When I take it out, I buy gold.
[01:10:03.187 --> 01:10:04.568]  I buy it in coins.
[01:10:05.309 --> 01:10:07.711]  I used to buy it in contracts.
[01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:11.814]  And I used to buy it from reputable companies.
[01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:20.761]  So when I'm saying, for me, when I'm saying I take my money out of the bank, I buy gold and I buy silver.
[01:10:21.162 --> 01:10:23.724]  And it goes back to GC's 3G's.
[01:10:24.404 --> 01:10:26.446]  Goals, guns, and a getaway plan.
[01:10:26.746 --> 01:10:28.968]  This thing is collapsing around us.
[01:10:29.628 --> 01:10:35.673]  Oh, I was mentioning about three-card Monty over there that's taking over Italy for Berlusconi.
[01:10:36.574 --> 01:10:38.695]  He's also a member of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:10:38.855 --> 01:10:39.176]  Of course.
[01:10:39.196 --> 01:10:39.936]  Son of a gun.
[01:10:40.797 --> 01:10:42.919]  Who would have ever thought that?
[01:10:42.979 --> 01:10:49.324]  Listen, of the last year, of the 130 guests there, more than 60 were Goldman Sachs.
[01:10:49.404 --> 01:10:51.926]  I mean, I don't remember the exact number, I think 67.
[01:10:52.206 --> 01:10:53.687]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:10:53.747 --> 01:10:55.348]  This is the inner coterie.
[01:10:56.383 --> 01:11:01.491]  I wanted to raise one more point with you, dealing with the economy and everything that's happening.
[01:11:01.992 --> 01:11:08.643]  You mentioned individuals digging in, not because we're in fear, but because we're empowered and ready for whatever the situation is.
[01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:13.615]  Look at what governments are doing for a decade since they got rid of Glass-Steagall.
[01:11:13.655 --> 01:11:14.615]  They've been digging in.
[01:11:14.635 --> 01:11:15.456]  They've been getting ready.
[01:11:15.676 --> 01:11:18.838]  The Pentagon admits they've been preparing a decade ago for collapse.
[01:11:18.918 --> 01:11:20.199]  They knew all this was coming.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.121]  They think they're going to ride the crisis they created.
[01:11:23.462 --> 01:11:26.444]  They're going to bring down the world just like they bring down companies.
[01:11:26.704 --> 01:11:29.346]  They go in and liquidate and steal the pension funds and butcher it.
[01:11:29.686 --> 01:11:36.311]  This is really a hostile takeover, a thousand times worse than the, you know, Charlie Sheen Wall Street that came out in the 80s.
[01:11:36.691 --> 01:11:37.792]  This is what they're doing.
[01:11:38.192 --> 01:11:45.439]  And they really are so arrogant up there in their big high-rises and all their armed guards, they think they're going to get away with this, Gerald.
[01:11:45.479 --> 01:11:49.503]  And I tell you, like Ron Paul said, if they get away with this, we deserve it.
[01:11:49.763 --> 01:11:55.149]  And we sit here when they destroy the dollar, steal our accounts, set up checkpoints, grope our wives.
[01:11:56.417 --> 01:11:57.919]  Then I guess we do deserve it, Gerald.
[01:11:58.639 --> 01:11:59.380]  I agree with you.
[01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:02.944]  When are the people going to find some courage and self-respect?
[01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:05.687]  And stop looking up to politicians.
[01:12:06.287 --> 01:12:09.971]  How can an adult actually behave like this is beyond me?
[01:12:10.412 --> 01:12:14.336]  And you have to take the future in your own hands and create the future.
[01:12:14.836 --> 01:12:15.657]  And it's, you know...
[01:12:16.698 --> 01:12:19.200]  We're going to be doing a documentary.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.322]  And there's a short out there now about me talking.
[01:12:22.722 --> 01:12:25.043]  And I say it's all about morality.
[01:12:25.604 --> 01:12:26.684]  That's all it is.
[01:12:27.205 --> 01:12:28.525]  It's due unto others.
[01:12:29.006 --> 01:12:30.907]  And there's no morality anymore.
[01:12:31.247 --> 01:12:43.094]  Whether it's at the top of the game with the Goldman Sachs gangs and the others and starting phony wars, or down to the welfare cheat of the person trying to go on disability.
[01:12:43.495 --> 01:12:45.476]  Everybody's gaining the system.
[01:12:45.936 --> 01:12:47.837]  So it goes back to morals.
[01:12:48.257 --> 01:12:50.139]  And I'm not talking about religion.
[01:12:50.159 --> 01:12:53.060]  I'm talking about spirituality, the individual.
[01:12:53.461 --> 01:13:02.906]  So, and as I said this before, Alex, there's that wonderful Hindu-Buddhist saying, whichever one, when the student's ready, the teacher appears.
[01:13:03.427 --> 01:13:05.088]  The people have to get ready.
[01:13:05.468 --> 01:13:07.809]  They have to find the morality within them.
[01:13:08.169 --> 01:13:12.052]  Because when enough find it, then the future will change.
[01:13:12.572 --> 01:13:13.752]  Only until that happens.
[01:13:13.912 --> 01:13:14.433]  That's right.
[01:13:14.773 --> 01:13:19.274]  People think America's too big to fail, and okay, we're corrupt, but it'll be okay.
[01:13:19.334 --> 01:13:19.534]  No.
[01:13:19.874 --> 01:13:21.535]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[01:13:22.175 --> 01:13:24.276]  And, I mean, folks, I'm concerned.
[01:13:24.316 --> 01:13:25.196]  I mean, this is real.
[01:13:25.776 --> 01:13:27.877]  This is another big signpost what's happened to Gerald.
[01:13:28.997 --> 01:13:31.239]  30 plus thousand other people and it's just going to get worse.
[01:13:31.319 --> 01:13:34.340]  It shows, this is the former New Jersey governor.
[01:13:34.761 --> 01:13:38.443]  This is the guy invested with the head of the commission that controls it.
[01:13:38.743 --> 01:13:42.005]  These people, like Bernie Madoff said, he said, I do what everybody does.
[01:13:42.065 --> 01:13:42.826]  And it's true!
[01:13:43.326 --> 01:13:45.987]  At that level, they're all like Bernie Madoff.
[01:13:46.988 --> 01:13:47.528]  That's right.
[01:13:48.109 --> 01:13:50.710]  And by the way, you know, there's this February 27th
[01:13:52.586 --> 01:13:57.990]  New York Magazine story that Bernie did out of his cell over the telephone.
[01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:01.933]  And there were two things that he said in this otherwise worthless story.
[01:14:02.774 --> 01:14:08.798]  One, that he learned that the game was rigged for the members of the club.
[01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:10.359]  Those are his words.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:15.783]  And number two, it's all one big Ponzi scheme.
[01:14:16.684 --> 01:14:17.645]  He said this.
[01:14:18.145 --> 01:14:19.646]  The King of Ponzi.
[01:14:20.386 --> 01:14:23.208]  Everybody open your eyes.
[01:14:23.688 --> 01:14:27.070]  It's collapsing worldwide.
[01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:30.992]  They're not going to be able to save the day.
[01:14:31.012 --> 01:14:33.714]  Do you know what the solution they're trying to come up with Europe?
[01:14:34.294 --> 01:14:36.536]  Is to have the European Central Bank
[01:14:37.176 --> 01:14:38.337]  Print money!
[01:14:38.857 --> 01:14:39.757]  Brilliant!
[01:14:40.297 --> 01:14:42.218]  Print more worthless money!
[01:14:42.618 --> 01:14:44.639]  Just like they're doing in the U.S.
[01:14:44.999 --> 01:14:48.000]  That's why I say, go!
[01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:51.662]  Absolutely, let's go to, you're absolutely right, let's go to some calls here.
[01:14:52.302 --> 01:14:54.683]  Bill in Connecticut, you're on the air with Gerald Cilenti, go ahead.
[01:14:56.084 --> 01:14:57.885]  Yes, hi Alex, hi Mr. Cilenti.
[01:14:59.485 --> 01:15:06.228]  What I'm wondering is, you know, we've looked, this definitely is a major signpost in the collapse, and in light of that,
[01:15:06.894 --> 01:15:23.293]  Do either of you two gentlemen see anyone within Congress that can form a committee with sub-subpoena power and prosecutorial power with real teeth that can call a guy in like Corzine and question him before the American public?
[01:15:24.431 --> 01:15:25.732]  Well, that's a good start.
[01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:26.452]  No, it's not.
[01:15:26.532 --> 01:15:27.953]  Who are you going to call in?
[01:15:27.973 --> 01:15:30.134]  What, are you going to go to the mob members?
[01:15:30.514 --> 01:15:33.935]  You know, are you going to go to the Dons and ask them to be nice?
[01:15:34.756 --> 01:15:36.056]  No, it's a whole thing.
[01:15:36.337 --> 01:15:37.837]  Look at the numbers that just came out.
[01:15:37.877 --> 01:15:49.923]  We were talking about it last night, on how these congressmen and senators know the inside deal of what's going to happen, and then they place bets on them and become, you know, multi-millionaires.
[01:15:50.183 --> 01:15:50.503]  Sure, sure.
[01:15:50.543 --> 01:15:54.807]  I mean, specifically, he was just saying... No, Congress is totally corrupt.
[01:15:55.067 --> 01:15:59.190]  There's a few good people in there, like Ron Paul and a few others.
[01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:01.552]  The rest of them, you know, forget it.
[01:16:01.692 --> 01:16:02.613]  No, no, I agree with you.
[01:16:02.653 --> 01:16:06.536]  He was just saying, specifically, is there anybody in a position of power?
[01:16:06.556 --> 01:16:07.957]  Ron Paul's over... No!
[01:16:08.017 --> 01:16:08.417]  No!
[01:16:08.938 --> 01:16:10.559]  Paul's not over one of the big committees.
[01:16:10.579 --> 01:16:11.400]  They've kept him out of it.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.220]  No, they're not going to do it!
[01:16:13.541 --> 01:16:15.641]  They put on these phony shows!
[01:16:16.302 --> 01:16:21.363]  They bring them in, they're all, they're in every... Well, Gerald, let me say this, because I think you're right.
[01:16:21.563 --> 01:16:31.667]  That's why they've gotten so bold to steal people's bank accounts now, is that they know, as Congress... Congress is so arrogant, they come out and they go, it's not insider trading when we do it.
[01:16:32.387 --> 01:16:34.569]  And 60 Minutes goes, it's soft corruption.
[01:16:34.609 --> 01:16:37.751]  No, it's hardcore, total insider trading.
[01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:40.593]  And it's not just insider trading, it's fraud.
[01:16:40.893 --> 01:16:44.836]  They are giving government bills and money to companies they're invested in.
[01:16:46.909 --> 01:16:47.490]  I know!
[01:16:47.650 --> 01:16:49.991]  I love that language, like you said, soft.
[01:16:50.732 --> 01:16:52.413]  That's prostitute language.
[01:16:52.693 --> 01:16:53.994]  Here, let me make this straight.
[01:16:54.914 --> 01:17:05.100]  The politicians are nothing more than enablers and enforcers for the financial and military crime bosses.
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:15.086]  So to ask the enablers and enforcers to bring the guys that put them in power, to put them
[01:17:15.627 --> 01:17:17.054]  It's not gonna happen!
[01:17:17.456 --> 01:17:18.823]  It never happens!
[01:17:21.494 --> 01:17:21.794]  Wow.
[01:17:22.535 --> 01:17:23.976]  Gerald, I know you've got to go here in a few minutes.
[01:17:23.996 --> 01:17:30.180]  Let's take a few more calls and maybe, I know you've got to go, but maybe bring in to the bottom of the hour so she can talk about some of your solution ideas in a moment.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.781]  Let's race through these calls.
[01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:33.062]  Gerald Cilente is our guest.
[01:17:33.363 --> 01:17:35.004]  He's not being negative, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:35.024 --> 01:17:36.225]  He's just facing facts.
[01:17:36.305 --> 01:17:38.566]  And they wouldn't be publicly going.
[01:17:38.726 --> 01:17:44.611]  We're allowed to insider trade and you're not if they weren't trying to inoculate us psychologically.
[01:17:44.651 --> 01:17:45.992]  But I appreciate the caller's point.
[01:17:46.892 --> 01:17:49.114]  Joe in Pennsylvania, you're on the air with Gerald Cilente.
[01:17:49.887 --> 01:17:50.347]  Oh, hello.
[01:17:50.647 --> 01:17:50.988]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:51.488 --> 01:17:52.408]  Yeah, hello, Mr. Salenti.
[01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:53.509]  I just want to make a point.
[01:17:53.949 --> 01:17:55.630]  I'm sorry this happened to Salenti.
[01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:59.032]  He's a great guy, but just a little guy on the post.
[01:17:59.052 --> 01:18:00.313]  I've been noticing my bank account.
[01:18:00.353 --> 01:18:01.734]  He missed his $60 here.
[01:18:01.754 --> 01:18:03.895]  The account is perfectly balanced out.
[01:18:04.395 --> 01:18:09.478]  I know what I spent, and I'm saying if they're going to take the big guys down, they've been probably playing with us for quite a while.
[01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:13.922]  Well that's what I was going to say is that everybody I know has companies overcharging them.
[01:18:14.203 --> 01:18:16.785]  I go to restaurants, I thought it was an accident the first ten times.
[01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:20.629]  Now restaurants will cheat you and add things you didn't buy.
[01:18:20.649 --> 01:18:22.351]  Like I didn't buy a bottle of wine.
[01:18:22.491 --> 01:18:23.292]  Oh well, never mind.
[01:18:23.873 --> 01:18:25.555]  Because they can tell you're not paying attention.
[01:18:26.215 --> 01:18:29.518]  And again, it's a culture of crooks, and it's permeating.
[01:18:29.558 --> 01:18:32.420]  A lot of people get cheated, and they don't decide to fight corruption.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.842]  They decide, well, I'll cheat somebody since it happened to me.
[01:18:35.282 --> 01:18:36.723]  And that's what Gerald was just getting to.
[01:18:36.763 --> 01:18:42.227]  Yes, banks are trying to charge all these new fees to keep your money, but they're also cheating people.
[01:18:42.507 --> 01:18:43.568]  So are other companies.
[01:18:43.608 --> 01:18:44.669]  Gerald, can you speak to that?
[01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:46.810]  Yes, that's what I was saying before.
[01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:48.672]  It all comes down to morality.
[01:18:49.192 --> 01:18:50.673]  And it goes beyond the money.
[01:18:51.074 --> 01:18:52.415]  I mean, look at this country.
[01:18:53.342 --> 01:18:56.625]  You know, the Founding Fathers would be turning in their graves.
[01:18:56.965 --> 01:19:03.932]  You got a clown like Bush and Cheney going out there, taking the country to war for fake reasons.
[01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:09.637]  That, you know, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[01:19:10.077 --> 01:19:14.322]  And in other countries, you know, they had a thing called the Nuremberg Trials.
[01:19:14.722 --> 01:19:24.213]  In this country, they put them out there on the media circuit, the prostitutes ask them softball questions, and they sell their books!
[01:19:24.974 --> 01:19:28.655]  Look what's going on at every level of immorality.
[01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:49.884]  Look at how they're letting these gas companies and oil companies frack the hell out of this country, pumping in millions and millions of gallons of chemicals into the earth and saying that, oh it doesn't do anything to poison the water.
[01:19:50.504 --> 01:20:02.419]  You know, I mean, it's one immorality after another, and as I said, all the politicians are, are enablers and enforcers for the crime bosses.
[01:20:02.599 --> 01:20:02.919]  I agree.
[01:20:02.959 --> 01:20:06.143]  Now, now, before we take a few more calls, I just want to add here,
[01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:15.962]  That, uh, if you look at all the other forms of immorality, I watched Ron Paul when he was given 89 seconds during the televised portion of the CBS debate.
[01:20:15.982 --> 01:20:16.782]  89 seconds.
[01:20:16.802 --> 01:20:18.884]  Turned out there was a memo saying only give him 90.
[01:20:19.284 --> 01:20:26.489]  So they cheated him even out of one second when, you know, the establishment hedge fund guy, you know, Romney, you know, he's getting 10 minutes plus.
[01:20:26.809 --> 01:20:33.113]  But expanding on that, Gerald, Ron Paul, when he said he was against torture, a bunch of people clapped, but a bunch didn't.
[01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:36.696]  And I watched all these soft men and women and I slowed it down.
[01:20:37.196 --> 01:20:42.517]  And watched it like 10 times because I was intrigued by it Sunday afternoon watching it via YouTube.
[01:20:42.957 --> 01:20:54.140]  And they shook their heads with satisfaction and anger and disgust and would look at each other and stick their chins out when Ron Paul said waterboarding is torture and it's wrong.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:56.441]  They think torture is sexy and cool.
[01:20:56.701 --> 01:20:58.921]  They think killing people without warrants is cool.
[01:20:59.302 --> 01:21:02.322]  They think lawlessness is cool because the government's their friend.
[01:21:02.362 --> 01:21:04.663]  I hear people on Mainline Talk Radio, they sound like
[01:21:04.963 --> 01:21:07.244]  Little goofy children that call in.
[01:21:07.264 --> 01:21:08.084]  They're not serious.
[01:21:08.104 --> 01:21:09.004]  They're not hard.
[01:21:09.465 --> 01:21:11.565]  And it is like lambs to the slaughter.
[01:21:11.605 --> 01:21:21.529]  And that's why they're doing this, is because I saw those soft, gullible people hissing at Ron Paul, begging for torture, begging for the rule of law to be taken.
[01:21:21.749 --> 01:21:27.130]  They have no idea that as the rule of law is taken, that's the oxygen leaving the room.
[01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:28.351]  Can you speak to that?
[01:21:29.011 --> 01:21:30.732]  Well, you're 100% right.
[01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:31.692]  That's very well put.
[01:21:31.712 --> 01:21:33.293]  The oxygen leaving the room.
[01:21:34.033 --> 01:21:36.774]  And again, as I said, it all comes back down to morality.
[01:21:37.154 --> 01:21:44.577]  And I love, as I said, I love... I just heard what's-his-name too, this other guy, the other tough guy out there.
[01:21:44.657 --> 01:21:45.797]  John Huntsman.
[01:21:45.957 --> 01:21:46.417]  Huntsman.
[01:21:46.758 --> 01:21:47.578]  Yeah, Huntsman.
[01:21:48.098 --> 01:21:53.841]  Another, you know, guy that's never probably been in a schoolyard fight, let alone a barroom brawl.
[01:21:54.582 --> 01:21:58.444]  He can't live with a nuclear-armed Iran.
[01:21:58.904 --> 01:22:00.785]  Oh, you can't, Johnny boy?
[01:22:01.165 --> 01:22:02.446]  I'll tell you what you do.
[01:22:03.266 --> 01:22:13.392]  Pack up your gear, take your old man's billions of dollars, take your wife, take your kids, and go fight against Iran.
[01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:15.633]  Or shut your fat mouth.
[01:22:17.702 --> 01:22:18.563]  And with all of them!
[01:22:18.884 --> 01:22:25.833]  Anybody out there that talks tough that wants to go to war, leave the charge or shut your mouth!
[01:22:26.534 --> 01:22:29.538]  And that's what really gets... Like that Gingrich!
[01:22:29.558 --> 01:22:31.200]  Oh, did you see this one?
[01:22:31.561 --> 01:22:33.664]  Gingrich made a million six!
[01:22:34.104 --> 01:22:35.146]  Advising!
[01:22:35.686 --> 01:22:47.736]  Freddie and Fannie, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, another fat boy who couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag that wants to get tough with Iran.
[01:22:48.456 --> 01:23:00.086]  All you big mouths out there, all you flabber mouths, send your kids, send your wife, send yourself, and send your money, or shut your mouth.
[01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:06.214]  No, they're going to try to use our money, and let's take a few more calls and we'll let Gerald go here and talk about some of his solutions before he goes.
[01:23:06.795 --> 01:23:09.318]  Let's talk to Steve in Oklahoma.
[01:23:09.338 --> 01:23:11.802]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente of TrendsResearch.com.
[01:23:13.695 --> 01:23:19.999]  Gerald, I just want to say I'm a member of your newsletter and I love it and feel sorry for you on what happened.
[01:23:20.039 --> 01:23:21.540]  I hope you get your money back.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.262]  But my comment is... Hold on, I feel sorry for us all.
[01:23:25.582 --> 01:23:28.323]  This means that the criminals are getting ten times more bold.
[01:23:28.984 --> 01:23:31.525]  I mean, this means the ball game is moving fast.
[01:23:31.565 --> 01:23:33.987]  So again, go ahead and make your point.
[01:23:34.007 --> 01:23:34.347]  I'm sorry.
[01:23:35.117 --> 01:23:43.103]  Okay, yeah, my comment was is that the, you know, I see the two political parties as nothing more than organized crime families who happen to tolerate each other.
[01:23:43.123 --> 01:23:48.487]  But one of these days, one of them's going to decide they want it all and they're going to get rid of the other one.
[01:23:48.867 --> 01:23:55.992]  And I think that John Gotti's only crime is that he tried to operate outside the two big political crimes.
[01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:56.973]  No, no, you just said it!
[01:23:57.453 --> 01:23:59.856]  The whole government brings in the drugs, all of it.
[01:24:00.156 --> 01:24:03.399]  They only bust people that don't pay their cut or launder their money through them.
[01:24:04.179 --> 01:24:14.669]  The head of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Grasso, back in 99 was in Reuters, went to the head of the FARC guerrillas in Colombia and said, invest your money with us or we're going to have you invaded.
[01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:16.411]  And they said no, so the U.S.
[01:24:16.751 --> 01:24:17.672]  covertly invaded.
[01:24:17.912 --> 01:24:18.673]  Gerald Cilente.
[01:24:19.568 --> 01:24:22.130]  Well, yeah, and that's this covert action thing.
[01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:24.171]  Well, first of all, thank you for subscribing.
[01:24:24.211 --> 01:24:26.032]  I'm glad you're enjoying the Trends Journal.
[01:24:26.593 --> 01:24:45.385]  And Alex made a point also, before I go on to the second one, that yeah, I'm losing money, but what I'm warning everybody is that every financial institution is under the same kind of pressure.
[01:24:46.246 --> 01:24:49.008]  Because the systems are collapsing.
[01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:58.574]  So, if you think your money is safe with any of those big names, you're making a big mistake.
[01:24:59.315 --> 01:25:07.481]  MF Global was one of the biggest of the 120-something trading groups out there, in the commodities end.
[01:25:08.241 --> 01:25:18.308]  And going back to what you were saying about the drug deals, now what they're doing is, against the law, they're sending in
[01:25:19.429 --> 01:25:29.414]  The United States troops, under one of their agency names, to go fight these phony drug wars in countries around the globe.
[01:25:29.714 --> 01:25:32.135]  And that's just to keep the prices up and knock out their competition.
[01:25:32.535 --> 01:25:34.936]  One more call, we'll come back to your calls after the break, but Gerald's gotta go.
[01:25:35.276 --> 01:25:37.197]  Here in a moment, let's talk to Sue in Georgia.
[01:25:37.457 --> 01:25:38.938]  You're on the air with Gerald Cilente, go ahead.
[01:25:41.733 --> 01:25:42.414]  Hi, Gerald.
[01:25:42.734 --> 01:25:50.119]  I'm sorry about what's happened to you, but if it's any consolation, I'm sure it's not.
[01:25:50.539 --> 01:25:53.921]  You're helping other people immensely.
[01:25:53.961 --> 01:25:54.942]  Sure, no, no, that's his point.
[01:25:54.962 --> 01:25:56.203]  He's not even talking about himself.
[01:25:56.423 --> 01:25:59.185]  He's saying this shows that the wolves are getting bold.
[01:26:01.681 --> 01:26:20.129]  Well, I understand that you are not a registered investment advisor, so you can speak to what your friends are doing, and I want to be very, very clear that they should be, or are, your friends.
[01:26:20.169 --> 01:26:21.269]  Ma'am, we're almost out of time.
[01:26:21.289 --> 01:26:22.550]  Just real quick, what's your question?
[01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:27.612]  401Ks, pay penalties, pay taxes, get everything out.
[01:26:28.388 --> 01:26:35.075]  I can tell you there's a story in Forbes Magazine, Laura Martin, I believe it was 2009.
[01:26:35.695 --> 01:26:38.818]  She was my assistant at the time, her company went bankrupt.
[01:26:39.339 --> 01:26:40.060]  One of these, uh...
[01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:43.552]  And she more than doubled her money!
[01:27:04.233 --> 01:27:06.454]  They said she overreacted.
[01:27:06.494 --> 01:27:09.515]  Now remember, now her money is more than doubled.
[01:27:09.835 --> 01:27:18.098]  So only speaking for myself, I will not trust one penny anywhere because there's a bigger story.
[01:27:18.518 --> 01:27:22.479]  And the bigger story is the devaluation of the dollar.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:29.502]  As the Europeans print more, as the Americans print more, the devaluation is going to continue.
[01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:32.043]  So only speaking for myself,
[01:27:32.623 --> 01:27:35.605]  Gold mostly, and silver as a hedge.
[01:27:36.066 --> 01:27:36.526]  That's right.
[01:27:36.986 --> 01:27:42.690]  And Jim Rogers said the same thing two nights ago on the show, that he thinks silver's even better because it hasn't moved up as much as gold.
[01:27:43.131 --> 01:27:44.332]  Ma'am, I hope that answers your question.
[01:27:44.352 --> 01:27:45.953]  Sorry, I was hurrying and we're just almost out of time.
[01:27:45.973 --> 01:27:48.615]  I've already kept Gerald longer than he said he could.
[01:27:49.295 --> 01:27:51.997]  Gerald, you've got the floor in the last two minutes as we go to break here.
[01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:53.618]  Solutions.
[01:27:53.779 --> 01:27:54.919]  I mean, where do you see this going?
[01:27:54.939 --> 01:27:59.503]  I think it's time for folks to get angry and really wake up and realize we've got a criminal government.
[01:28:00.063 --> 01:28:02.126]  Well, I tell you, we have a criminal government.
[01:28:02.166 --> 01:28:07.753]  I've told you my only solution that I know of this time, and that's directdemocracynow.org.
[01:28:08.514 --> 01:28:12.919]  And as I mentioned to you, oddly, of all the people in the world,
[01:28:14.228 --> 01:28:32.737]  This week and last week, in the Wall Street Journal, and in, I believe it was Monday's Financial Times, Vladimir Putin, the Prime Minister of Russia, is saying that now is a possible time to look at, quote, direct democracy.
[01:28:33.197 --> 01:28:46.506]  We have to take the power out of the hands of the 535 gangsters that are telling 312 million of us how to tie our shoes and put it back in the hands of the people.
[01:28:46.966 --> 01:28:48.768]  Let the people run the country.
[01:28:49.108 --> 01:28:53.331]  I'm sick of these politicians telling me they're public servants.
[01:28:53.931 --> 01:28:56.353]  They haven't cleaned my toilet lately.
[01:28:56.813 --> 01:29:00.216]  How about doing what we tell you to do, Nancy?
[01:29:01.579 --> 01:29:06.803]  Nancy Pelosi, instead of you telling me what to do.
[01:29:06.823 --> 01:29:14.049]  Hey, Mitch McConnell, I'm tired of hearing your flabby mouth telling me what's good for me.
[01:29:14.409 --> 01:29:16.190]  You do what I want you to do.
[01:29:16.211 --> 01:29:20.134]  Hey, all of you out there, Mr. President.
[01:29:20.814 --> 01:29:22.675]  Listen to the voice of the people.
[01:29:22.975 --> 01:29:24.916]  We're supposed to have a democracy.
[01:29:24.956 --> 01:29:26.356]  It's a kleptocracy.
[01:29:26.737 --> 01:29:27.817]  It's fascism.
[01:29:28.137 --> 01:29:31.999]  Let's have a real democracy, a direct democracy.
[01:29:32.439 --> 01:29:34.260]  Let the people vote.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.361]  DirectDemocracyNow.org.
[01:29:36.761 --> 01:29:40.042]  Gerald Solente, obviously we'll continue to talk to you as things develop.
[01:29:40.062 --> 01:29:41.163]  TrendsResearch.com.
[01:29:41.443 --> 01:29:42.483]  Thank you so much for your time.
[01:29:42.503 --> 01:29:43.364]  I know you're very busy.
[01:29:43.784 --> 01:29:48.266]  God bless and hopefully we'll all be able to defend ourselves from these criminals.
[01:29:50.492 --> 01:29:53.481]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.444 --> 01:29:57.113]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.232 --> 01:30:02.373]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:30:02.413 --> 01:30:09.096]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:30:09.336 --> 01:30:11.617]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:30:11.637 --> 01:30:17.100]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:20.062]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:30:20.322 --> 01:30:22.383]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:30:22.623 --> 01:30:28.566]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.886 --> 01:30:32.087]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.267 --> 01:30:37.790]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:39.350]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:40.951]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.991 --> 01:30:43.512]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.652 --> 01:30:47.714]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.874 --> 01:30:49.915]  You can find the video at www.
[01:30:50.615 --> 01:30:51.376]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:51.416 --> 01:30:56.020]  This holiday season, more than half of our nation is in need of help due to the shattered economy.

[01:31:57.168 --> 01:32:03.813]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:32:04.954 --> 01:32:05.875]  Tyranny is here.
[01:32:06.235 --> 01:32:09.938]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:10.098 --> 01:32:12.380]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:17.865]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:18.265 --> 01:32:24.510]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:30.452]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:30.892 --> 01:32:34.573]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:35.073 --> 01:32:39.054]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.354 --> 01:32:44.856]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:45.296 --> 01:32:48.277]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:48.857 --> 01:32:50.278]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.818 --> 01:32:51.258]  It's here.

[01:33:32.261 --> 01:33:37.727]  No one believed that the Soviets would invade so many countries and do so many horrible things.
[01:33:38.928 --> 01:33:42.872]  And they started small, they got more and more bold.
[01:33:45.235 --> 01:33:49.279]  Well, it's the same thing as the Nazis or any other authoritarian group.
[01:33:51.761 --> 01:33:57.043]  And societies, media, universities, everybody's geared around facing a military threat.
[01:33:58.203 --> 01:34:03.726]  We all know some weird leader in a uniform strutting around and screaming is bad news.
[01:34:04.846 --> 01:34:16.410]  Well, these guys are little old ball-headed men who talk in weird financial languages designed... Their emails have all come out where they're cussing and laughing and calling us scum and recordings of it.
[01:34:16.890 --> 01:34:17.271]  Ha ha!
[01:34:17.291 --> 01:34:19.051]  These idiots will buy all the stuff we do!
[01:34:19.171 --> 01:34:20.212]  We're stealing everything!
[01:34:20.272 --> 01:34:20.752]  Ha ha ha!
[01:34:21.346 --> 01:34:22.167]  That's what's going on behind
[01:34:40.009 --> 01:34:55.289]  Strengthening in the second quarter if we continue growth and all other systems are not stagnant that the overall driver could show some concern by the third quarter if we do not move up in the systematic overlay system.
[01:34:55.569 --> 01:34:57.211]  I mean, just total bull.
[01:34:57.591 --> 01:35:00.174]  They're selling pure derivatives garbage to people.
[01:35:00.515 --> 01:35:04.920]  They're coming in, buying off your local politicians to raise big bonds and invest them in crud.
[01:35:05.401 --> 01:35:07.583]  They're coming in and going, it's for the earth, for the earth!
[01:35:07.863 --> 01:35:10.366]  Taking property, 20,000 acres plus in Austin.
[01:35:10.627 --> 01:35:13.150]  Years later, handing it over to the big banks to build on.
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.820]  Some of the farmers outside Austin wouldn't sell their property.
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:23.222]  They actually sent the SWAT teams out there and got on bullhorns a decade ago, or more, and said, come out, come out.
[01:35:23.242 --> 01:35:25.282]  They were like, extremists won't leave their property.
[01:35:25.522 --> 01:35:27.482]  It's for the Earth, a biosphere.
[01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:33.603]  Five years later, they go, we're taking the biosphere off and selling it to the former mayor's best friends that contributed.
[01:35:33.943 --> 01:35:37.604]  Here's the $300 million in property for $5 million.
[01:35:37.924 --> 01:35:38.484]  It's yours.
[01:35:38.704 --> 01:35:39.124]  Thank you.
[01:35:39.604 --> 01:35:42.985]  Now the former mayor will set up a bank that gets all the business deals.
[01:35:45.363 --> 01:35:47.063]  And they're like, well, they're letting us do this.
[01:35:47.483 --> 01:35:48.824]  Start taking the bank accounts.
[01:35:49.444 --> 01:35:49.984]  Don't like it?
[01:35:50.004 --> 01:35:51.224]  SWAT teams are standing by.
[01:35:52.604 --> 01:35:54.925]  By the way, if you get too uppity, Al-Qaeda might hit.
[01:35:55.905 --> 01:35:57.325]  You know, Al-Qaeda could hit any minute.
[01:35:57.365 --> 01:36:02.306]  We have to take all your rides and have to grab your wife's genitals and your children's genitals and your genitals.
[01:36:05.607 --> 01:36:09.847]  Because if we don't, if we don't, it's all over.
[01:36:10.988 --> 01:36:12.328]  You see, because Al-Qaeda will get us.
[01:36:13.803 --> 01:36:15.184]  Now, I want to get into the financial news.
[01:36:15.204 --> 01:36:17.526]  I want to get into all this other crazy news and continue with your phone calls.
[01:36:17.546 --> 01:36:18.846]  I want to do what we did yesterday again.
[01:36:18.866 --> 01:36:21.488]  That was fun, giving each caller 30 seconds.
[01:36:22.269 --> 01:36:25.051]  And then myself only 10, because we got to a lot of people.
[01:36:25.071 --> 01:36:25.731]  800-259-9231.
[01:36:25.751 --> 01:36:26.251]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:27.132]  People ask, why do I know so much?
[01:36:27.192 --> 01:36:28.733]  People ask, why do I predict things so accurately?
[01:36:38.735 --> 01:36:41.918]  What has every historian and philosopher said in different ways?
[01:36:42.818 --> 01:36:45.741]  Old, wise men, from every culture.
[01:36:46.521 --> 01:36:49.424]  If you don't study history, you are going to be a slave.
[01:36:50.124 --> 01:36:52.206]  If you don't study history, you're doomed to repeat it.
[01:36:53.416 --> 01:36:57.818]  Great wisdom comes with studying human history, because humans do the same things over and over again.
[01:36:58.498 --> 01:37:10.504]  I, back when I had time, it's one of the few things I miss, because I read so many news articles, so many documents, that by the time I'm done working at 7, 8, 9 o'clock at night, some nights even later, I cannot read history books anymore.
[01:37:11.504 --> 01:37:15.626]  My eyes, if I do, are bloodshot the next day, and I actually get eye strain.
[01:37:15.666 --> 01:37:16.427]  I just can't do it anymore.
[01:37:17.127 --> 01:37:17.607]  I can't do it.
[01:37:18.488 --> 01:37:20.509]  But, up until just a few years ago,
[01:37:21.716 --> 01:37:23.837]  I would read a history book every week.
[01:37:25.117 --> 01:37:26.358]  Read a couple chapters, go on to bed.
[01:37:27.558 --> 01:37:29.679]  And humans act the same over and over again.
[01:37:29.899 --> 01:37:34.040]  I know every globalist trick, inside and out, because they study history.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.822]  They've just reworked every other game plan, every other blueprint.
[01:37:37.962 --> 01:37:40.423]  I know them, because I know humanity.
[01:37:41.483 --> 01:37:42.383]  I know the species.
[01:37:42.483 --> 01:37:44.324]  I know the good, I know the bad, I know the ugly.
[01:37:44.584 --> 01:37:46.585]  I know myself, and I know the enemy.
[01:37:49.005 --> 01:37:50.226]  The average person grew up
[01:37:51.772 --> 01:37:52.873]  Got hardly any schooling.
[01:37:52.913 --> 01:37:55.134]  If they did, it was mind-numbing garbage.
[01:37:55.634 --> 01:37:57.695]  And they just learned how to do a specialized task.
[01:37:58.255 --> 01:37:59.976]  They go hate that task all day.
[01:38:00.297 --> 01:38:02.698]  The beginning of degradation of the mind is not liking your work.
[01:38:04.315 --> 01:38:10.597]  And then they just want to go blow their mind on sports, drugs, alcohol, whatever it is, when they get off work.
[01:38:10.777 --> 01:38:11.657]  And I don't blame people.
[01:38:12.217 --> 01:38:20.660]  You worked all day at some job you hate, you want to go spend that time you got, you let your kids run wild because you want a few hours, and the TV's there creating the new culture.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.360]  We don't have a culture anymore.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.821]  You notice political correctness attacks every culture?
[01:38:26.101 --> 01:38:52.928]  Pushes the plastic corporate culture which is an anti-human culture in all their textbooks by Design because humanity and goodness is not compatible with the new world order But if we ever rediscover being men being women If we ever does rediscover the normal proper roles if we ever rediscover What it's all about
[01:38:56.187 --> 01:38:57.447]  It's pure milk and honey.
[01:38:58.348 --> 01:38:58.968]  Life is great.
[01:38:59.008 --> 01:39:00.068]  This is a beautiful planet.
[01:39:01.188 --> 01:39:02.309]  Every moment is a gift.
[01:39:02.809 --> 01:39:03.649]  Every day a blessing.
[01:39:06.050 --> 01:39:08.171]  God has laid out so many wonderful things for us.
[01:39:08.251 --> 01:39:08.851]  It's incredible.
[01:39:09.811 --> 01:39:15.073]  The world is so beautiful and so good and so full of electric life and energy and
[01:39:18.542 --> 01:39:19.003]  Magic.
[01:39:20.325 --> 01:39:21.947]  That's why I hate evil.
[01:39:22.327 --> 01:39:23.489]  That's why I hate corruption.
[01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:35.246]  Because I hate pain, I hate sickness, I hate those that wish to vandalize beauty, those that wish to attack goodness, those who wish to dominate the weak.
[01:39:40.726 --> 01:39:52.682]  I have an overriding desire to energize and set bushfires in the minds of good men and women and see you rise together and we will crush evil with God's help.
[01:39:52.962 --> 01:39:56.447]  We will absolutely overdrive it and annihilate it.
[01:39:58.615 --> 01:40:11.125]  And then a great time of blessing will come, and then our grandchildren will become decadent again, and evil will creep back in, and people will say, oh, the old-timers, they say, fight corruption, put up with no forms of corruption, because they don't want you to have a good time.
[01:40:12.305 --> 01:40:15.468]  Let us not forget what we've been through over and over again.
[01:40:15.968 --> 01:40:17.670]  We've been through all this over and over again.
[01:40:18.290 --> 01:40:20.051]  Over and over and over and over again.
[01:40:20.352 --> 01:40:21.412]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:40:21.653 --> 01:40:25.556]  But now, because of the high-tech weapons and systems, we can't go through this again.
[01:40:25.816 --> 01:40:27.157]  We're not going to make it.
[01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:39.200]  If we go through this again... Now, they've taught through the globalist churches the last 150 years that it's the end of the world every five minutes and there's no reason to fight evil because God's coming back.
[01:40:39.601 --> 01:40:44.646]  Even if God was coming back in five minutes, it's our responsibility to fight evil or God's gonna say he knows it's not.
[01:40:45.953 --> 01:40:49.617]  And if you don't believe in God, my point is, it's a giant scapegoat.
[01:40:49.998 --> 01:40:59.007]  And I've gone over it, I've had experts on it show where the globalists funded this, where the Illuminati funded the idea that the end of the world is always coming, so why fight evil?
[01:40:59.288 --> 01:41:00.429]  Romans 13, all that.
[01:41:01.130 --> 01:41:02.912]  Well, I could quote the Bible to you all day.
[01:41:03.072 --> 01:41:04.554]  None of us 100 year reprieve.
[01:41:04.874 --> 01:41:05.775]  The list goes on and on.
[01:41:05.795 --> 01:41:07.136]  The times Israel did repent.
[01:41:07.935 --> 01:41:12.216]  And was spared, and blessed, and warned over and over again.
[01:41:12.356 --> 01:41:15.197]  It's a lie that everything is set in stone.
[01:41:15.597 --> 01:41:24.639]  It's set in stone in the vision of the Creator, but God then lets us make the decisions on this plane about which way we go.
[01:41:24.679 --> 01:41:28.239]  It's almost like, you ever seen those children's books that came out in the 80s?
[01:41:29.640 --> 01:41:35.281]  I know I read them, where there's like two or three different outcomes, depending on how you read the book.
[01:41:36.121 --> 01:41:37.942]  You see, you see, the book's written.
[01:41:38.843 --> 01:41:41.965]  Every one of those possible realities is in the mind of the Creator.
[01:41:42.666 --> 01:41:43.306]  Like a crystal.
[01:41:44.026 --> 01:41:45.708]  But, like a hologram.
[01:41:46.208 --> 01:41:50.071]  But we, free will, decide.
[01:41:52.272 --> 01:41:54.594]  So things are predestined, but they're not.
[01:41:54.614 --> 01:41:55.574]  You see, that's the riddle.
[01:41:55.614 --> 01:41:57.656]  That's 3, 4, 5 dimensional thinking.
[01:41:59.637 --> 01:42:03.500]  And it doesn't matter, because the body and all of this is transitory.
[01:42:04.895 --> 01:42:07.657]  Fear not he who can kill the body, fear he who can kill the soul.
[01:42:08.698 --> 01:42:11.460]  The globalists don't want money, they use that to get us to sell out.
[01:42:14.687 --> 01:42:20.270]  They use that as their false form of energy that's actually just a symbol that they get us to sell out for.
[01:42:20.530 --> 01:42:21.551]  That they control society.
[01:42:21.831 --> 01:42:25.093]  The globalists, at the end of the day, are obsessed with your mind.
[01:42:25.553 --> 01:42:27.334]  They are obsessed with your intellect.
[01:42:27.634 --> 01:42:30.876]  They are obsessed with how you're raised and what you believe.
[01:42:31.156 --> 01:42:34.879]  They traffic, as Revelation says, in the souls of men.
[01:42:34.899 --> 01:42:37.160]  In fact, my uncle gave me a Bible verse.
[01:42:38.237 --> 01:42:42.202]  I wrote it down about they kill souls, they destroy from, I think, Ezekiel.
[01:42:42.782 --> 01:42:43.944]  And I had it in here last week.
[01:42:44.664 --> 01:42:45.666]  And I guess it got taken out.
[01:42:45.706 --> 01:42:46.206]  I lost it.
[01:42:46.306 --> 01:42:48.449]  I was going to read it, but it was another passage that said the same thing.
[01:42:48.809 --> 01:42:51.192]  The point is, even if you don't believe the Bible, it's history.
[01:42:51.693 --> 01:42:53.475]  It's people seeing the same things.
[01:42:53.815 --> 01:42:55.237]  We've gone through the same things.
[01:42:55.617 --> 01:42:56.859]  It's happened over and over again.
[01:42:58.407 --> 01:43:05.695]  Now I'm going to get into the economy a little bit here, and then I'm going to get into, you can't make this up, and I think Kerr ought to send this to Drudge because this is pretty powerful.
[01:43:06.016 --> 01:43:09.319]  DOJ says make it a federal crime to lie on the internet.
[01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.502]  But they'll decide what's a lie.
[01:43:11.922 --> 01:43:13.244]  The liar of liars.
[01:43:13.664 --> 01:43:14.766]  The king of liars.
[01:43:15.927 --> 01:43:18.169]  This system will tell us what a lie is.
[01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:19.251]  And you've heard them.
[01:43:20.683 --> 01:43:24.565]  They've said if you don't believe in man-made global warming and don't want to pay Al Gore money, you should be arrested.
[01:43:24.845 --> 01:43:27.647]  That's the White House regulations are coming up with this stuff.
[01:43:27.907 --> 01:43:29.208]  Coming up with this new regulation.
[01:43:29.448 --> 01:43:30.588]  This is Cass Sunstein.
[01:43:32.029 --> 01:43:32.709]  Gonna cover that.
[01:43:35.611 --> 01:43:38.393]  Super Congress is now to decide the new farming bill in secret.
[01:43:39.053 --> 01:43:42.695]  Not the regular Congress, but the appointed High Court of Satan.
[01:43:44.434 --> 01:43:47.095]  I don't know, 12 people with a 13th head?
[01:43:47.916 --> 01:43:49.796]  Don't you see all the Illuminati stuff in your face?
[01:43:49.816 --> 01:43:51.857]  12 disciples, Christ the 13th.
[01:43:53.058 --> 01:43:54.959]  Oh boy, these people are out of control.
[01:43:55.579 --> 01:43:57.080]  Let's go ahead and, uh...
[01:43:58.353 --> 01:44:00.174]  Go to Ted Anderson here on The Economy.
[01:44:00.575 --> 01:44:02.756]  Wow, you heard Gerald Solente earlier, what he's doing.
[01:44:03.176 --> 01:44:08.080]  And he was taking delivery of his six figures plus of gold, and they just said, we're taking it.
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.161]  And now that's a big national news story.
[01:44:11.022 --> 01:44:12.543]  The whole markets are melting down.
[01:44:13.523 --> 01:44:18.427]  Bank of America is getting ready to go to the public for 79 trillion in derivatives.
[01:44:19.408 --> 01:44:24.171]  Folks, the entire budgets of this country's not even, you know, one-tenth of that.
[01:44:27.333 --> 01:44:29.356]  The military budget is $1,800,000,000 on budget, off budget, supplemental.
[01:44:33.766 --> 01:44:35.367]  I mean, we're talking about a joke here.
[01:44:36.227 --> 01:44:40.269]  And they're going to convince you somehow you owe it and say, well, the public needs to pay their fair share.
[01:44:40.309 --> 01:44:41.350]  America got lazy.
[01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:42.350]  America deserves it.
[01:44:42.390 --> 01:44:56.458]  And the public's like, I guess I've got to have my taxes raised and live in a shack because America owes, you know, this stuff for Bank of America, this globalist company financing open borders, anti-gun movements, New World Order garbage, Federal Reserve shareholders.
[01:44:56.998 --> 01:45:02.361]  Ted Anderson, what do you make of Gerald Cilenta and your 34 years in gold and silver brokering to have
[01:45:03.842 --> 01:45:10.791]  The company he was involved with bought up by MF Global and then they seized his private account with over six figures in it.
[01:45:11.932 --> 01:45:13.294]  And at first people didn't believe this.
[01:45:13.374 --> 01:45:15.317]  Now it's in Bloomberg, AP, everywhere.
[01:45:15.337 --> 01:45:17.740]  They're going, yeah, it looks like it's illegal.
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:19.942]  They took people's private accounts, Ted.
[01:45:20.243 --> 01:45:21.685]  What does this signify to Ted Anderson?
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:25.103]  Well, Alex, I think we're going to see a lot more of that kind of thing.
[01:45:25.143 --> 01:45:27.946]  I mean, I've been warning about that for quite some time here.
[01:45:27.986 --> 01:45:42.462]  I mean, the United States is becoming desperate, and so the corporations that are, you know, that are sort of in the too-big-to-fail category for the United States, I mean, they're going to be doing more of that kind of thing.
[01:45:42.922 --> 01:45:45.346]  And it doesn't surprise me a bit that they're trying to do that.
[01:45:45.366 --> 01:45:49.292]  So now Gerald has taken physical delivery of gold and silver.
[01:45:49.352 --> 01:45:50.914]  I can't think of a better thing to do.
[01:45:51.274 --> 01:45:58.986]  People, you just have to realize that if you're putting your money into an institution and these institutions are in such great trouble,
[01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:00.508]  What do you think's going to happen?
[01:46:00.728 --> 01:46:03.632]  I mean, the government's going to come in and, you know, they're going to ask for bailouts.
[01:46:03.933 --> 01:46:10.242]  But part of this is, you know, just to nationalize and to be able to grab a hold of and seize these assets.
[01:46:10.542 --> 01:46:13.206]  They can't do that when you have physical gold and silver.
[01:46:13.486 --> 01:46:15.349]  When you own it, they don't control it.
[01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:17.892]  That's why it's such a good idea to do this, Alex.
[01:46:18.192 --> 01:46:21.135]  People are going to see more of this.
[01:46:21.216 --> 01:46:22.337]  It happened in Argentina.
[01:46:22.597 --> 01:46:23.478]  It happened in Brazil.
[01:46:23.498 --> 01:46:26.582]  It certainly happened during the Weimar Republic in Germany.
[01:46:26.602 --> 01:46:29.185]  I mean, you were lucky to be able to get out of that country.
[01:46:29.825 --> 01:46:30.486]  The only way you were able
[01:46:30.486 --> 01:46:30.646]  I think?
[01:46:54.431 --> 01:46:56.832]  Ted, I want to get to that in a moment, but I want to point something out here.
[01:46:56.852 --> 01:46:59.092]  People keep asking, how are we always right?
[01:46:59.432 --> 01:47:05.914]  How do we know Greece was going to go down, and Ireland, and then Italy, and then Spain?
[01:47:06.354 --> 01:47:08.415]  Because the globalists planned it.
[01:47:08.815 --> 01:47:09.615]  It's a playbook.
[01:47:09.675 --> 01:47:12.876]  They've done it all over the third world, all over Eastern Europe.
[01:47:13.596 --> 01:47:20.382]  We got the documents 11 years ago, 2002, I guess 10 years ago, where they said that they would do all this.
[01:47:20.462 --> 01:47:22.985]  I've been screaming bloody murder every day since then.
[01:47:23.465 --> 01:47:29.510]  I told you they'd announce a Bank of the World, that it would be dictatorial, and Time Magazine says, Banker Goldman Sachs Coup!
[01:47:29.851 --> 01:47:32.033]  Goldman Sachs rules Europe like it's good!
[01:47:33.214 --> 01:47:34.875]  Technocrats, get rid of freedom!
[01:47:35.356 --> 01:47:37.698]  And the media's like, yeah!
[01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:40.161]  Actual Wall Street folks are, we've got power!
[01:47:40.401 --> 01:47:42.604]  They've signed on to like a new Nazi party.
[01:47:43.105 --> 01:47:44.206]  Don't you idiots get it?
[01:47:44.367 --> 01:47:46.369]  And they're going to blame capitalism for all this.
[01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:51.436]  I mean, Ted, we've been right about this because it's historical what's happening.
[01:47:52.363 --> 01:47:53.584]  That's really what's going on, Alex.
[01:47:53.664 --> 01:47:55.544]  It's just a repeat of history.
[01:47:55.564 --> 01:48:02.127]  You know, what has happened in the past is what our current government is trying to do to solve problems.
[01:48:02.407 --> 01:48:09.590]  When they're jumping to the printing press, when they're seizing assets like Gerald was talking about, I mean, that's the direction where this country's heading.
[01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:16.373]  We're going away from liberty, we're going away from freedom, we're going away from property rights and the individual's
[01:48:16.533 --> 01:48:17.855]  And it's premeditated, Ted.
[01:48:18.195 --> 01:48:20.638]  They're following, they want total collapse.
[01:48:20.698 --> 01:48:24.362]  They don't want people to have confidence in the systems anymore.
[01:48:24.703 --> 01:48:25.564]  This is the end.
[01:48:25.984 --> 01:48:28.347]  If we let these crooks get away with it, they are so bold.
[01:48:28.747 --> 01:48:30.590]  People, I believe in gold and silver.
[01:48:30.610 --> 01:48:33.273]  I've been recommending silver since it was $5, gold since it was $260 something.
[01:48:35.253 --> 01:48:36.415]  Gold and silver are rising.
[01:48:36.695 --> 01:48:38.297]  They can drive it down short term.
[01:48:38.538 --> 01:48:42.043]  But as I said months ago when they did, I said when it's lower is a buying opportunity.
[01:48:42.083 --> 01:48:42.964]  Now it's gone back up.
[01:48:43.424 --> 01:48:45.888]  Because globally they're devaluing currencies.
[01:48:46.288 --> 01:48:47.490]  Globally this is happening.
[01:48:48.413 --> 01:48:50.655]  Ted Anderson's got the gold and silver on hand.
[01:48:50.995 --> 01:48:52.696]  He will ship it directly to you.
[01:48:53.057 --> 01:48:54.918]  That's why I'm hooked up with this company.
[01:48:55.138 --> 01:48:57.320]  Ted, briefly, as we're about to go to break, I'm gonna come back with calls.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:07.047]  Tell folks about your spectrum of specials, the radio specials, that again, this is gold you bought in the last month, you ran out of the stuff you bought two months ago, so you're buying it at a lower price.
[01:49:07.427 --> 01:49:08.588]  Ted doesn't raise prices.
[01:49:08.888 --> 01:49:12.651]  As the market goes up, he locks it in and gives you that saving.
[01:49:13.151 --> 01:49:14.973]  Ted, give folks the loss leaders for the day.
[01:49:15.353 --> 01:49:15.854]  Yeah, sure.
[01:49:15.894 --> 01:49:16.755]  I mean, let's talk about it.
[01:49:16.775 --> 01:49:19.299]  I mean, real quick, we're still offering the video and book deal.
[01:49:19.659 --> 01:49:23.104]  I think there's about 500 copies of that book left, and then it's done.
[01:49:23.265 --> 01:49:24.246]  We're not going to have any more.
[01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:30.054]  That two silver dollars book video, the silver dollars that cost with the free book video and shipping, 500 of those left.
[01:49:30.074 --> 01:49:31.757]  That'll go probably by next week.
[01:49:32.037 --> 01:49:33.638]  Yeah, $73 a piece.
[01:49:33.678 --> 01:49:40.980]  I mean, you just can't beat that deal with two silver dollars, the book, and the video that explains what's going on in our economy, and the book.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:42.961]  You know, it's just a great deal put together.
[01:49:43.761 --> 01:49:45.882]  We have Frank's currently right now at $3.86.
[01:49:46.302 --> 01:49:47.263]  Walking Liberty's are at $16.58.
[01:49:48.963 --> 01:49:50.764]  All this stuff is for physical delivery.
[01:49:51.104 --> 01:49:54.708]  I still think it's a good idea to take a look at the older $10 Liberties.
[01:49:54.728 --> 01:49:56.429]  They're at $1,050 right now.
[01:49:56.690 --> 01:50:01.134]  There's just a lot of things that are in that right buying range right now.
[01:50:01.154 --> 01:50:03.957]  I mean, I saw a little bit of a decrease in gold today.
[01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:10.523]  It hit down to as low as $1,752.10, and then it came racing right back up again, and right now we're at $1,778.
[01:50:10.943 --> 01:50:14.167]  You know, I try to buy in those little dips.
[01:50:14.747 --> 01:50:24.156]  They're just, I mean, the opportunities to be able to accumulate a good quantity of good material to sell, it's just getting harder to do.
[01:50:24.457 --> 01:50:33.645]  There's just not as much material to go around nowadays, and shortages and supply drive up premiums, and that's just the way the market's been.
[01:50:33.986 --> 01:50:37.329]  But if you do want to get involved at this time, I can't suggest that.
[01:50:37.329 --> 01:50:38.850]  Let me give folks the number.
[01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.910]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:41.691 --> 01:50:42.612]  Gold and silver, folks.
[01:50:42.632 --> 01:50:43.672]  They can answer your questions.
[01:50:43.712 --> 01:50:44.392]  The brokers are there.
[01:50:44.412 --> 01:50:46.573]  Tell them to read you the list of radio specials.
[01:50:46.934 --> 01:50:51.676]  Gold, silver, bullion, you name it.
[01:50:51.696 --> 01:50:51.996]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:52.016 --> 01:50:53.317]  The brokers are there until midnight.
[01:50:53.877 --> 01:50:55.558]  And Ted can't hold these deals very long.
[01:50:55.578 --> 01:50:56.558]  The prices will go up.
[01:50:56.578 --> 01:50:57.018]  800-686-2237.
[01:50:57.038 --> 01:50:58.219]  Your call straight ahead.

[01:54:26.443 --> 01:54:29.546]  EMF Global looted customers' accounts via internal bank run.
[01:54:29.966 --> 01:54:34.109]  Big players got warning ahead of time that financial broker was set to collapse.
[01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:39.393]  We've got links to all the documents, all the admissions there, and then Gerald Salente's interview last night with us.
[01:54:40.414 --> 01:54:45.338]  Very, very powerful, powerful information at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:46.339 --> 01:54:48.841]  And this just shows how ruthless they are.
[01:54:49.541 --> 01:54:52.584]  Now, because people are complaining, they say they might give people some of their money back.
[01:54:53.499 --> 01:54:54.780]  And no, it's not insured.
[01:54:55.601 --> 01:55:00.786]  Well, as they bankrupt the other big banks and systems, they're just going to insure it by printing more money.
[01:55:00.806 --> 01:55:01.827]  And that's what's happening in Europe.
[01:55:02.127 --> 01:55:02.888]  That's what's happening here.
[01:55:02.908 --> 01:55:05.711]  That's why inflation's going up as the real economy depresses.
[01:55:05.751 --> 01:55:11.617]  I'm going to go to your calls here, the folks that are patiently holding here in just a moment, Mike and others.
[01:55:11.657 --> 01:55:12.457]  But briefly,
[01:55:13.558 --> 01:55:16.380]  Ted, final comments on this.
[01:55:16.481 --> 01:55:24.046]  I mean, how big of a deal is this for you to see the former New Jersey governor, the little darling of the establishment, running this operation?
[01:55:25.567 --> 01:55:29.790]  Well, I mean, again, you have major institutions that are in trouble.
[01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:41.739]  This is one institution that's failing, Alex, and to have the corruption that you're seeing, I mean, you're just scratching the surface on what's actually going on out there in the financial community.
[01:55:42.179 --> 01:55:48.464]  And there's going to be more of this going on, and it's going to affect the people that are invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds.
[01:55:48.865 --> 01:55:49.825]  I mean, you name it.
[01:55:50.226 --> 01:55:55.470]  All these institutional type investments are at risk because of this type of activity.
[01:55:55.991 --> 01:56:03.777]  And just the very fact that the United States dollar has been printed to solve our economic issues is a big problem in and of itself.
[01:56:03.837 --> 01:56:07.420]  And then you add in these institutions that are crumbling and falling apart.
[01:56:07.900 --> 01:56:11.263]  Absolutely, and that's what Jim Rogers said a few days ago on the show.
[01:56:11.283 --> 01:56:14.125]  Farmland, gold, silver, firearms, food, friends you can trust.
[01:56:14.145 --> 01:56:15.346]  That's what's valuable.
[01:56:15.446 --> 01:56:16.967]  And of course, a relationship with God.
[01:56:37.443 --> 01:56:39.065]  Ted Anderson, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:40.366]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.

[01:57:01.785 --> 01:57:04.106]  The American Dream and of course Mark Dice's new book.
[01:57:04.746 --> 01:57:08.247]  Mike in New York, we'll come back in the third hour with full news and your calls.
[01:57:08.607 --> 01:57:09.668]  Mike in New York, go ahead.
[01:57:10.458 --> 01:57:12.519]  Hey, nice to speak with you, Alec.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.321]  Nice to share a dialogue with you.
[01:57:15.381 --> 01:57:17.562]  I have a story to share.
[01:57:18.322 --> 01:57:25.286]  Well, Gerald, I live actually one county south of him, but I had a story ten years ago.
[01:57:25.306 --> 01:57:33.171]  I became a day trader part-time in the late 90s, which would often bring up the illegitimate family courts.
[01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:42.097]  My goodness, they created a different department, a property execution department in there, and my checks never made it there on time.
[01:57:42.138 --> 01:57:49.984]  By the time the notification mailed up to our state capitol and the information was transferred down to this department New York State created.
[01:57:50.084 --> 01:57:56.369]  Anyways, to make a long story short, they restrained all my checking counts, banking counts, suspended my driver's license.
[01:57:56.989 --> 01:58:18.215]  I mean it goes on endless but at that time I had six figures close to half a million dollars as a day trader in the stock market and what they did to me prior to right before 9-11 just restrained my account and it wasn't for a couple weeks or just take the money out of the account but they restrained them for eight months and virtually I lost $450,000 in that
[01:58:20.155 --> 01:58:21.596]  Hold on, I gotta hear more about this.
[01:58:21.656 --> 01:58:22.077]  Incredible.
[01:58:22.357 --> 01:58:23.258]  I've seen these reports.
[01:58:23.278 --> 01:58:24.539]  And again, sounds good.
[01:58:24.879 --> 01:58:26.981]  Make the dead beat dads pay the child support.
[01:58:28.302 --> 01:58:29.723]  But notice the moms never have to.
[01:58:29.763 --> 01:58:35.207]  But the issue is, then they set up grids to shut down all your accounts, all your business, all your commerce.
[01:58:35.607 --> 01:58:37.769]  Now that can be used against everybody.
[01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:39.670]  He will buy nor sell without it.
[01:58:41.812 --> 01:58:43.634]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:59:03.483 --> 01:59:10.286]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:12.187 --> 01:59:14.488]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:59:16.269 --> 01:59:18.570]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[01:59:20.683 --> 01:59:24.566]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:59:25.287 --> 01:59:28.409]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.930]  Others don't.
[01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:32.232]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:59:54.065 --> 01:59:55.967]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.987 --> 01:59:59.230]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.902 --> 02:00:10.105]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.745 --> 02:00:11.566]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.326 --> 02:00:13.307]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.887 --> 02:00:17.469]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.070 --> 02:00:22.212]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.272 --> 02:00:24.774]  Alright, we're into hour number three.
[02:00:24.814 --> 02:00:25.534]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:00:25.554 --> 02:00:28.876]  I have massive, tons of key news we're going to cover today.
[02:00:29.617 --> 02:00:34.560]  First, I want to continue to go into a bunch of your calls, because you always bring up interesting points, news, and information.
[02:00:36.325 --> 02:00:37.305]  Take Gerald Solente.
[02:00:37.385 --> 02:00:39.366]  He had more than six figures coming to him.
[02:00:39.426 --> 02:00:40.306]  It was in his account.
[02:00:40.886 --> 02:00:43.347]  But he was also trading in gold futures.
[02:00:44.127 --> 02:00:46.388]  And so that messes up all his other positions.
[02:00:46.448 --> 02:00:47.908]  Now they're saying there's no money in his account.
[02:00:48.909 --> 02:00:51.469]  And so that's going to damage him that way, he told me last night on air.
[02:00:52.430 --> 02:01:01.912]  And Mike brings up that for eight months, because the checks didn't get to the right department, I've seen this in the news too, where they won't process the child support payments right that the government takes.
[02:01:03.053 --> 02:01:04.013]  And then they penalize you.
[02:01:04.983 --> 02:01:13.965]  Well, I've seen cases of where a father even has custody and the wife of another state decides to go ahead and go get, lie and say she needs child support and they'll give it to her.
[02:01:15.188 --> 02:01:17.070]  It's all part of breaking up the family.
[02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:26.139]  And you can always find some deadbeat examples of dads, but that's like taking people's kids because they're, you know, poor, and then giving them to CPS, who's the most abusive group out there.
[02:01:26.179 --> 02:01:27.941]  It's like, well, you might be a problem.
[02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:29.062]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[02:01:29.343 --> 02:01:32.226]  So we'll just give you to a group of known perverts and scumbags.
[02:01:32.446 --> 02:01:36.009]  Here, who's on record being a bunch of pedophiles, but here it is.
[02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:38.671]  But Mike, if you just tuned in, was telling the story.
[02:01:39.291 --> 02:01:45.294]  For eight months, he had $600,000 in the account, I think he said, of day trading.
[02:01:45.314 --> 02:01:46.415]  He'd done a really great job.
[02:01:47.115 --> 02:01:49.936]  And they just restrained it so that he couldn't make decisions.
[02:01:50.797 --> 02:01:52.878]  And it all went to Hades in a handbasket.
[02:01:53.598 --> 02:01:55.559]  And that's what's happening to this society.
[02:01:55.579 --> 02:02:00.802]  And then business isn't safe to conduct, and your society collapses because nobody trusts anybody.
[02:02:01.502 --> 02:02:04.766]  This is being done by design to create a post-industrial world.
[02:02:05.126 --> 02:02:09.312]  The bankers are stealing all the money and assets in the process of destroying the free market.
[02:02:09.612 --> 02:02:16.020]  They will then blame the free market for wrecking everything and offer communism as the answer, as the bankers said offshore.
[02:02:17.161 --> 02:02:18.503]  That's the New World Order in essence.
[02:02:18.983 --> 02:02:20.125]  Mike in New York.
[02:02:20.345 --> 02:02:20.966]  Finish your story.
[02:02:21.724 --> 02:02:23.444]  Yeah, you're correct, Alex.
[02:02:23.784 --> 02:02:27.545]  Just to mention a couple other things that go with that.
[02:02:27.605 --> 02:02:29.326]  I mean, triple your insurance rates.
[02:02:30.286 --> 02:02:39.368]  The bank charged me with each bounced check besides the regular $30 fee, a $100 legal fee besides that.
[02:02:40.028 --> 02:02:49.870]  Let me change the subject a little bit and bring you back another highlight that I learned from you maybe four or five years ago, and that was a comprehensive annual financial report.
[02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:59.433]  And I looked and dug deep into it in my county where I live, and I spoke with the county exec, the assistant anyways, to the county exec.
[02:02:59.973 --> 02:03:12.638]  And just to remind your listeners out there, the comprehensive financial report just lists the incomes and expenditures for each county throughout the United States, and typically
[02:03:12.978 --> 02:03:34.905]  Taking the point that you raised, the gentleman you had on, and I think you even did a video, a short video with that, is of course we have sales tax and property taxes, but the third omni-appointment thing was that each county, you know, has between $100 and maybe $300 or $400 million that they invest.
[02:03:35.366 --> 02:03:39.427]  And that's basically the main job of the county exec, is reinvest every year.
[02:03:39.667 --> 02:03:43.471]  But do they never put that on the budget and then they basically end up siphoning it off?
[02:03:43.511 --> 02:03:45.232]  It's a giant double set of books.
[02:03:45.252 --> 02:03:50.538]  They actually learn it from Al Capone, the Chicago 1313 model then adopted by the US government.
[02:03:51.207 --> 02:04:03.137]  And we cover it in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report's exposed DVD, which is one of the 18 films you get with the Everything Special, I should add, we're only running until Christmas, of 99 bucks, get them all.
[02:04:03.177 --> 02:04:06.259]  But, yeah, I tell you, that's what's dangerous about this cashless society.
[02:04:06.299 --> 02:04:17.729]  They can take your money, they can shut your accounts off for no reason, they can also, now with this cashless system, not let you use your money to buy or sell, they can track everything you're doing, they can put all these new fines and fees on it.
[02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:20.150]  The cashless society
[02:04:21.112 --> 02:04:25.245]  Is about the bankers being able to absolutely rob you and there's nothing you can do.
[02:04:26.676 --> 02:04:39.866]  With the rate of returns anymore throughout the country, I think that's going to be a critical number that's going to be missed, and you're going to damage municipalities, as one of your listeners pointed out to you, Alabama, declaring one of the counties down there.
[02:04:39.886 --> 02:04:40.867]  It's all designed.
[02:04:40.887 --> 02:04:46.371]  They bankrupt the counties, the states, then the national government, and the bankers that engineered it all will then pose as saviors.
[02:04:46.711 --> 02:04:55.258]  The corporate paid whores will call them God and say they are the ones that help us, and the bankers will then just continue crisis after crisis until we're all homeless.
[02:04:55.478 --> 02:04:56.319]  That's their plan.
[02:04:56.459 --> 02:04:57.619]  Total criminal takeover.
[02:05:01.042 --> 02:05:05.284]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:05:05.605 --> 02:05:06.225]  Number one.
[02:05:06.505 --> 02:05:09.667]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:09.927 --> 02:05:10.508]  Number two.
[02:05:10.808 --> 02:05:15.351]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:15.691 --> 02:05:16.131]  It's true.
[02:05:16.432 --> 02:05:18.393]  Total government control of electricity.
[02:05:18.533 --> 02:05:20.994]  In the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:21.295 --> 02:05:21.835]  Number 3.
[02:05:22.115 --> 02:05:25.397]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:25.697 --> 02:05:29.419]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:29.619 --> 02:05:30.180]  Number 4.
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:32.781]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:33.181 --> 02:05:36.563]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:36.863 --> 02:05:37.064]  Number 5.
[02:05:37.644 --> 02:05:41.566]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:41.786 --> 02:05:46.549]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:46.829 --> 02:05:50.852]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:51.012 --> 02:05:52.574]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:52.794 --> 02:05:54.855]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:55.036 --> 02:05:57.397]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:06:01.926 --> 02:06:03.428]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.628 --> 02:06:08.673]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:08.953 --> 02:06:10.295]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:10.475 --> 02:06:19.264]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:20.004 --> 02:06:27.109]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:27.530 --> 02:06:35.155]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:35.536 --> 02:06:42.941]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:45.703 --> 02:06:48.606]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:06:48.907 --> 02:06:51.229]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:51.289 --> 02:06:53.432]  Or see Calvin on the web at FiveStarSoap.com.
[02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:05.371]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:07:05.771 --> 02:07:08.772]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:07:09.012 --> 02:07:13.813]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:07:14.173 --> 02:07:20.054]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:07:20.194 --> 02:07:22.435]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:07:22.895 --> 02:07:23.175]  Tim Geithner?
[02:07:23.195 --> 02:07:23.356]  Bernanke?
[02:07:23.376 --> 02:07:23.796]  They're arsonists!
[02:07:23.816 --> 02:07:24.457]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:07:24.517 --> 02:07:26.199]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:07:41.877 --> 02:07:48.782]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:07:49.162 --> 02:07:58.529]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:08:01.257 --> 02:08:06.262]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:06.622 --> 02:08:08.964]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:08.984 --> 02:08:13.428]  Okay, I'm gonna go back to your calls and all this other incredible news.
[02:08:13.468 --> 02:08:19.233]  DOJ says make it a federal crime to lie on the internet, but the chief liars will decide what lying is.
[02:08:20.354 --> 02:08:30.057]  Just total police state coming to America as the criminals steal everything publicly and militarize the police, checkpoints, black uniforms, cameras, microphones hanging out of trees.
[02:08:30.577 --> 02:08:33.979]  Just every form of classical evil now manifesting and this is only the beginning.
[02:08:34.279 --> 02:08:42.821]  The army of evil is only gathering around us and brainwashing its servants and baptizing them in more Satanism and more evil and more TSA pedophilia.
[02:08:42.841 --> 02:08:44.102]  Just absolute wickedness.
[02:08:44.682 --> 02:08:46.143]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:08:46.703 --> 02:08:50.325]  By the way, people say, oh, this is, you know, this guy's sitting here, it's gloom and doom.
[02:08:50.785 --> 02:08:53.947]  Reality is so much more than I can even tell you, okay?
[02:08:54.547 --> 02:08:57.309]  We've gotten too comfortable accepting corruption and evil.
[02:08:58.269 --> 02:08:58.549]  Okay?
[02:08:59.049 --> 02:09:00.030]  That's what's happening right now.
[02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:02.691]  Yeah, we're going to take your bank account for no reason and keep it.
[02:09:03.752 --> 02:09:05.793]  Yeah, we're going to give Al-Qaeda control of Libya.
[02:09:06.173 --> 02:09:09.475]  Yeah, the TSA is going to be able to check points and grab your genitals on the highway.
[02:09:11.946 --> 02:09:14.068]  See how it's all just getting crazier and crazier?
[02:09:14.369 --> 02:09:16.050]  And it's gonna get even crazier still!
[02:09:16.391 --> 02:09:17.172]  And then crazier!
[02:09:17.452 --> 02:09:20.835]  Because the crooks run everything now, and they're going wild!
[02:09:21.776 --> 02:09:25.440]  And they don't like us on air talking about them, so they're talking about censorship right now.
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:31.467]  Now before I go to Joe, and everybody else that's holding, I want to do a program note here.
[02:09:32.508 --> 02:09:34.249]  I'll be doing the show live Friday.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:37.722]  Maybe even Sunday and then Monday, Tuesday.
[02:09:38.483 --> 02:09:42.006]  But I'm going to be out of town, so I'm going to be doing it from the road via video Skype.
[02:09:42.487 --> 02:09:46.270]  Aaron Dyches will be here waiting in the wings if there's any technical problems he can pop in.
[02:09:47.251 --> 02:09:49.633]  But Aaron is doing the show by himself tomorrow.
[02:09:49.693 --> 02:09:54.097]  Aaron Dyches, who also from time to time does a great job hosting InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:09:54.884 --> 02:09:57.985]  I'll be filing reports from the road that'll be aired here.
[02:09:58.485 --> 02:10:07.427]  I'll be filing reports from the road separate from the Skype interviews and the Skype broadcast to the radio network for the nightly news as well.
[02:10:08.047 --> 02:10:23.411]  And I've decided before next year starts and I start traveling to our AM and FM affiliates and doing speaking engagements and broadcasting from their studios that I'm going to do a quick trip to the Southwest and up into those areas because in
[02:10:26.361 --> 02:10:36.553]  In 2000, well, in 1997, I traveled to some of the national parks and would just politely ask about the UN marker saying it was UN property.
[02:10:36.573 --> 02:10:37.954]  They would blow up and freak out on us.
[02:10:38.635 --> 02:10:47.104]  So I thought that I would go and revisit America Destroyed by Design and illustrate where we are 14 years later from my first film.
[02:10:47.785 --> 02:10:57.810]  We're going to shoot a special report on that, but there'll be reports on the ground, filed at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and here on the radio, but then I'll also put together a big report when I get back.
[02:10:58.610 --> 02:11:07.114]  So that is all coming up from the road, but tomorrow Aaron Dykes is going to be here.
[02:11:08.462 --> 02:11:22.686]  And Aaron Dykes is going to do a special report in the first hour, live, but also airing excerpts of last night's special, truly revealing chemtrails with all the documents, how they do it, the patents, the declassified documents.
[02:11:23.346 --> 02:11:27.707]  All of it is being basically broken down in great detail.
[02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:34.629]  That is going to air during the first hour with Aaron bringing in even more information we didn't get to last night.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:39.663]  Then we're going to have a FEMA camp breakdown.
[02:11:39.743 --> 02:11:51.375]  Homeland Security, National Security State, John Warner Defense Authorization Act, Governor's Council, Rural Affairs takeover piece.
[02:11:51.995 --> 02:11:55.459]  That'll be the entire second hour and then Aaron has guests in the third.
[02:11:57.048 --> 02:12:00.389]  And I'll undoubtedly call in sometime tomorrow as well and file some reports.
[02:12:01.109 --> 02:12:06.871]  So tomorrow, very special broadcast and I'll host the entire three hours on Friday.
[02:12:07.371 --> 02:12:10.732]  So that is all coming up tomorrow.
[02:12:10.812 --> 02:12:11.832]  Please spread the word about it.
[02:12:16.674 --> 02:12:18.414]  Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[02:12:18.834 --> 02:12:20.855]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California.
[02:12:20.895 --> 02:12:21.455]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:12:26.294 --> 02:12:26.954]  Hey Joe!
[02:12:28.135 --> 02:12:29.016]  How you doing my friend?
[02:12:29.036 --> 02:12:30.617]  Okay, Joe's gone.
[02:12:30.637 --> 02:12:32.238]  Let's talk to Garrett in Mississippi.
[02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:33.118]  Garrett, you're on the air.
[02:12:33.778 --> 02:12:34.999]  Hey Alex, how you doing man?
[02:12:35.119 --> 02:12:35.680]  Good my friend.
[02:12:35.700 --> 02:12:41.543]  Alright, it's a long time no see, but I just wanted to make a statement about Silver and Gold.
[02:12:41.823 --> 02:12:44.605]  I started buying it back when you told us 14 years ago.
[02:12:44.625 --> 02:12:47.747]  I'm picking up $5 here and there now.
[02:12:48.347 --> 02:12:51.569]  But I'm giving this as a cautionary statement to anybody out there.
[02:12:52.389 --> 02:12:54.731]  Get your money out of the system now.
[02:12:56.041 --> 02:12:59.965]  Put it in silver, because right now it's sitting at $35.
[02:13:00.465 --> 02:13:04.989]  But my statistical analysis, we're looking at $65 by, you know, first quarter of next year.
[02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:06.451]  Well, I know this.
[02:13:06.551 --> 02:13:09.834]  It hasn't moved up as much via inflation as gold.
[02:13:10.174 --> 02:13:14.058]  Gold, in my gut, and this is my personal opinion, is still a really safe move.
[02:13:15.039 --> 02:13:18.101]  But it's gotten closer to its bubble than silver.
[02:13:18.762 --> 02:13:20.363]  And Jim, Roger, and others agree.
[02:13:20.764 --> 02:13:21.665]  Silver is the way to go.
[02:13:24.015 --> 02:13:26.958]  If you do buy gold, that's what I tell people to buy is 10 ounces.
[02:13:27.758 --> 02:13:31.281]  Because it is easier to transfer into smaller quantities.
[02:13:32.162 --> 02:13:37.206]  Just like in Raul's book, a guy had a Corvette for sale for two, you know, two $50 gold pieces.
[02:13:37.766 --> 02:13:39.087]  You know, it's too big.
[02:13:39.788 --> 02:13:45.652]  But people have got to realize, and the people that's going to hurt when this stuff goes down is people like my parents that are on fixed incomes.
[02:13:46.273 --> 02:13:49.095]  You know, get your money out of the bank.
[02:13:49.727 --> 02:13:52.328]  The only thing I use a bank for is to pay my bills.
[02:13:52.928 --> 02:14:02.572]  Anything left over goes in the safe as greenbacks or I, you know, I keep, you know, catch a special like Midas puts out or something like that.
[02:14:02.712 --> 02:14:05.253]  But Alex, I appreciate you taking my call and I want to tell you this.
[02:14:05.273 --> 02:14:06.994]  Folks have got to get prepared.
[02:14:07.731 --> 02:14:09.333]  The snowball is rolling downhill.
[02:14:09.913 --> 02:14:12.576]  If it wasn't for you, it would have happened about 10 years ago.
[02:14:12.596 --> 02:14:13.497]  Alright?
[02:14:14.158 --> 02:14:17.221]  And everybody out there, get the information out.
[02:14:17.621 --> 02:14:19.663]  You know, forget about Christmas this year.
[02:14:19.683 --> 02:14:22.085]  Get your pantries full.
[02:14:22.506 --> 02:14:24.728]  Get your cartridge boxes filled up.
[02:14:25.309 --> 02:14:28.172]  And just get ready for the storm that's coming probably next year.
[02:14:28.772 --> 02:14:29.793]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:14:30.073 --> 02:14:34.696]  And you know what, if somehow we make it out of this without a total collapse, good, then we were prepared.
[02:14:34.716 --> 02:14:39.138]  You know, you've got insurance, just in case, you know, something bad happens.
[02:14:39.479 --> 02:14:44.281]  But unfortunately, more and more, it looks like it runs from bad to worse.
[02:14:44.442 --> 02:14:48.164]  The best case scenario is long, stagnating depression.
[02:14:48.544 --> 02:14:50.345]  Worst case is road warrior collapse.
[02:14:50.445 --> 02:14:52.546]  And we're so decadent and spoiled on average now.
[02:14:53.707 --> 02:14:55.369]  People are so out of it on average.
[02:14:57.512 --> 02:15:01.837]  That's what you've got to worry about in a collapse, is the zombie-like population throwing fits.
[02:15:02.758 --> 02:15:07.343]  And all the family and people, even if they're awake, where are they going to get food?
[02:15:07.403 --> 02:15:08.424]  Where are they going to get money?
[02:15:09.461 --> 02:15:13.204]  I mean, again, folks, you don't need just food and money for yourself.
[02:15:13.624 --> 02:15:20.429]  You need to be able to get ready to take care of those in-laws and people, because even though they laugh at you and stuff, they're going to end up asking for help.
[02:15:21.389 --> 02:15:30.956]  And I don't even know, if people laugh at you too much, you might not want to help them, because they'll get in your house while you're helping them and say they saw something illegal, make it up, and call the cops to move into your house.
[02:15:31.016 --> 02:15:32.917]  I mean, the yuppies are deadly.
[02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:35.399]  They will serve evil until the end.
[02:15:36.656 --> 02:15:39.937]  And I'm not talking about my in-laws, but I'm guessing some people's in-laws.
[02:15:40.657 --> 02:15:45.378]  And people who are into this world, they are into it, and they're going to hold on to it forever.
[02:15:46.098 --> 02:15:48.158]  And no amount of trendiness is going to protect them.
[02:15:49.078 --> 02:15:50.378]  I understand trendiness is fine.
[02:15:50.418 --> 02:15:54.899]  It's really just a brainwashing of the establishment of false worth.
[02:15:55.459 --> 02:15:56.819]  And I feel sorry for these people.
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:15:59.420]  Anything else, Garrett?
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:01.780]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:05.621]  If you recall, I went through Katrina, the aftermath of it.
[02:16:06.377 --> 02:16:14.939]  If we got to depend on the federal government to come down there to help us in this coming economic storm, you can forget about it.
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:19.261]  It took them two weeks to mobilize to even think about doing something.
[02:16:19.761 --> 02:16:25.382]  The people that did stuff for us in South Mississippi when I was living down there was the Ohio National Guard.
[02:16:25.702 --> 02:16:29.803]  They loaded up the trucks with MREs and water and they came on their own accord.
[02:16:30.223 --> 02:16:35.605]  The federal government is just a bunch of yahoos and if Ron Paul doesn't get elected next year,
[02:16:37.021 --> 02:16:37.842]  Uh, Katie Bartador.
[02:16:38.763 --> 02:16:39.183]  I hear you.
[02:16:39.203 --> 02:16:39.763]  God bless you.
[02:16:39.783 --> 02:16:40.344]  I appreciate you.
[02:16:40.364 --> 02:16:44.967]  Yeah, when they had fires all over Texas, FEMA would block other fire departments and people from helping.
[02:16:45.728 --> 02:16:56.596]  And I had, uh, I have a friend who manages one of the biggest apartment complexes, and she went down to give them free apartment complexes for six months, and FEMA wouldn't, said, we don't want your help, even though they saw people that needed help.
[02:16:57.076 --> 02:16:59.278]  It's just all about a federal power grab.
[02:17:00.339 --> 02:17:02.920]  It's just, this government is run by a bunch of rats.
[02:17:03.781 --> 02:17:05.963]  Uh, Johnny in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:17:07.999 --> 02:17:09.702]  You think it's bad down there?
[02:17:09.722 --> 02:17:11.085]  It's bad up here in Canada too.
[02:17:11.746 --> 02:17:13.530]  You want a good example of the New World Order?
[02:17:13.570 --> 02:17:15.553]  Come and live in Alberta.
[02:17:17.838 --> 02:17:24.423]  You can't go anywhere without there being photo radar cameras, sheriffs, this, that, and you're always trying to get money out of your pocket.
[02:17:25.044 --> 02:17:25.604]  All the time.
[02:17:26.004 --> 02:17:28.887]  I've listened to your show for quite a while and I have to thank you.
[02:17:28.947 --> 02:17:32.289]  I've managed to save myself from losing a lot of cash.
[02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:35.511]  Some of your guests were very informative.
[02:17:35.712 --> 02:17:43.678]  I pulled out on RRSPs and put into a little bit of silver and bought a horse and made sure I had enough ammunition and I got a little bit of food.
[02:17:43.718 --> 02:17:45.939]  So I just keep up the good work.
[02:17:47.526 --> 02:17:50.227]  It's not just in America, it's all over the world.
[02:17:50.807 --> 02:17:54.188]  And it's, unfortunately, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[02:17:54.348 --> 02:17:55.528]  I don't think it's even going to get better.
[02:17:55.748 --> 02:17:56.528]  You're right, Johnny.
[02:17:56.608 --> 02:17:57.769]  It's a new world order.
[02:17:57.829 --> 02:18:02.910]  It's the same system, the same Goldman Sachs everywhere, doing the exact same thing.
[02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:03.950]  And it's a plan.
[02:18:04.270 --> 02:18:06.071]  People are like, oh, the government's trying to fix it.
[02:18:06.151 --> 02:18:06.751]  No, they're not.
[02:18:07.231 --> 02:18:08.912]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:18:08.952 --> 02:18:13.113]  It's all been actuaried and planned out to the finest detail.
[02:18:15.066 --> 02:18:18.707]  That's why, one reason this show is so popular, people put up with me and all the things I do.
[02:18:19.247 --> 02:18:21.228]  As Lord knows people, I can hardly listen to my own show.
[02:18:21.648 --> 02:18:22.889]  It's because we've been right.
[02:18:23.009 --> 02:18:24.069]  We've helped a lot of people.
[02:18:24.409 --> 02:18:25.930]  The globalists could have helped you.
[02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:27.190]  They could have given you good advice.
[02:18:27.530 --> 02:18:28.711]  They do what we say.
[02:18:29.411 --> 02:18:31.051]  They're buying gold and silver.
[02:18:31.372 --> 02:18:32.192]  They're digging in.
[02:18:32.232 --> 02:18:34.553]  They've always been digging in.
[02:18:34.593 --> 02:18:36.233]  They give you bad advice.
[02:18:36.593 --> 02:18:39.274]  It's not that we're smart and have all the answers.
[02:18:39.514 --> 02:18:41.395]  It's that we're just giving you common sense.
[02:18:42.435 --> 02:18:43.276]  I appreciate your call.
[02:18:43.296 --> 02:18:44.196]  Let's jam in another here.
[02:18:45.063 --> 02:18:46.568]  Al in Delaware, you're on the air.
[02:18:47.799 --> 02:18:52.201]  Hi Alex, I have to tell you, you saved many, many lives, including my own.
[02:18:53.101 --> 02:18:55.202]  Some years ago, I started giving up on real estate.
[02:18:55.222 --> 02:18:56.643]  I've been a builder for 30 years.
[02:18:57.063 --> 02:18:59.084]  I told my friends to start getting out.
[02:18:59.624 --> 02:19:01.525]  Start preparing for scorched earth.
[02:19:01.865 --> 02:19:04.826]  The government is attacking us at every angle.
[02:19:05.406 --> 02:19:11.849]  I mean, I really believe that these chemtrails are designed to keep us from being able to sustain.
[02:19:12.129 --> 02:19:17.251]  They're eating out our sustenance, poisoning groundwater, and you can't imagine.
[02:19:17.771 --> 02:19:26.401]  And everything that we're seeing out here in the news times ten, and when you see Obama come on the news, do the opposite of what this man drives us to do.
[02:19:26.561 --> 02:19:27.482]  He's a liar!
[02:19:28.504 --> 02:19:29.725]  Okay, he's a manipulator.
[02:19:29.765 --> 02:19:30.806]  No, he is an enemy.
[02:19:30.826 --> 02:19:35.650]  He is an enemy spokesman like Baghdad Bob up there be lying to people.
[02:19:35.930 --> 02:19:36.270]  Stay there.
[02:19:36.290 --> 02:19:42.976]  I want to have you finish on the other side and then we'll come back with Steve and Scott, Mike, George and others.
[02:19:43.276 --> 02:19:45.978]  We're talking to Al in Delaware right now.
[02:19:46.318 --> 02:19:47.479]  So everybody stay right there.
[02:19:47.499 --> 02:19:49.741]  We're going to come right back on the other side of the break.
[02:19:49.821 --> 02:19:53.724]  And yes, that's what most governments end up doing is attacking their people.
[02:19:54.585 --> 02:19:55.726]  This is world history!
[02:19:56.106 --> 02:19:59.929]  These are conscious, hardcore, sociopath criminals!
[02:20:01.390 --> 02:20:02.671]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:02.711 --> 02:20:08.055]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[02:20:08.295 --> 02:20:12.918]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[02:20:13.319 --> 02:20:18.382]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[02:20:18.883 --> 02:20:20.724]  So our friends at Solutions from Science
[02:20:20.964 --> 02:20:21.484]  We're good to go!
[02:20:49.011 --> 02:20:52.696]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:20:53.237 --> 02:20:57.744]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:20:58.064 --> 02:21:00.448]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:03.552]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[02:21:03.812 --> 02:21:05.794]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[02:21:05.834 --> 02:21:06.555]  debt crises.
[02:21:06.755 --> 02:21:07.536]  You heard me right.
[02:21:07.776 --> 02:21:10.218]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[02:21:10.258 --> 02:21:13.661]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[02:21:13.921 --> 02:21:20.787]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[02:21:21.287 --> 02:21:22.448]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:22.548 --> 02:21:29.551]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[02:21:29.731 --> 02:21:37.154]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[02:21:37.574 --> 02:21:41.276]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[02:21:41.516 --> 02:21:47.178]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[02:21:47.398 --> 02:21:53.460]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:55.941]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[02:21:56.121 --> 02:21:56.401]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.771 --> 02:22:02.193]  Storable foods, check.
[02:22:02.594 --> 02:22:03.795]  Water filters, check.
[02:22:04.176 --> 02:22:05.517]  Gold and silver, check.
[02:22:05.918 --> 02:22:07.120]  Tactical gear, check.
[02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:09.723]  What's missing from your survival checklist?
[02:22:10.084 --> 02:22:12.507]  An essential that should not be taken for granted.
[02:22:12.667 --> 02:22:14.890]  Storable vitamins and nutritional supplements.
[02:22:15.711 --> 02:22:18.973]  Most foods do not contain the essential micronutrients your body needs.
[02:22:19.213 --> 02:22:24.835]  You need Survival RX, the world's first ultra-long-term storable vitamins and nutritional supplements.
[02:22:25.135 --> 02:22:25.696]  How long?

[02:22:52.848 --> 02:22:56.169]  That's survival, the letter R, the letter X, dot com.
[02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:59.731]  Add survivalrx.com to your preparedness checklist today.
[02:23:01.511 --> 02:23:04.473]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:23:04.893 --> 02:23:07.735]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[02:23:08.035 --> 02:23:22.964]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:23:23.344 --> 02:23:24.365]  In all at least 68 diseases,
[02:23:25.245 --> 02:23:25.705]  We're good to go.
[02:23:46.511 --> 02:23:48.752]  You know, people over the years have asked, why are you so frantic?
[02:23:48.772 --> 02:23:49.833]  Well, I was a student of history.
[02:24:15.976 --> 02:24:27.740]  I began to read what governments were putting out about a global government, the end of families, a cashless society, bankrupting everybody, forced abortion.
[02:24:27.900 --> 02:24:30.261]  And I was like, man, this is hardcore authoritarianism.
[02:24:31.601 --> 02:24:32.461]  I want to fight this.
[02:24:33.282 --> 02:24:37.083]  They were trying to pass all sorts of gun bans, restricting guns in Texas.
[02:24:37.663 --> 02:24:39.143]  They were property grabbing.
[02:24:40.604 --> 02:24:41.884]  They were doing it nationally.
[02:24:41.964 --> 02:24:43.745]  And I said, I'm going to stand up against these people.
[02:24:44.978 --> 02:24:47.319]  And in 17 years, seems like a long time.
[02:24:47.379 --> 02:24:49.319]  That is just a flash in the pan.
[02:24:49.939 --> 02:24:53.400]  A twinkling of the eye in the scheme of time.
[02:24:55.401 --> 02:24:59.102]  And think of how much America's changed in 17 years, just since I got in the fight.
[02:24:59.682 --> 02:25:03.463]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're going to see more change now in the next five than we've seen in the last 50.
[02:25:04.986 --> 02:25:06.607]  And it's not going to be for the good.
[02:25:06.747 --> 02:25:08.829]  I mean, the system has done this consciously.
[02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:16.995]  And the realization that vicious, wicked people who want to do bad are in control.
[02:25:17.015 --> 02:25:19.016]  Now, old-timers always knew that.
[02:25:20.497 --> 02:25:22.018]  The Founding Fathers said that.
[02:25:22.699 --> 02:25:26.602]  And they try to train cops in these training seminars and stuff that, you know, we're dangerous, we're crazy.
[02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:32.222]  Those that talk about government being big and dangerous, they're bad, like the founding fathers.
[02:25:32.242 --> 02:25:35.063]  I mean, I have that on video, FEMA teaching police that.
[02:25:35.483 --> 02:25:36.723]  And the cops believe it, a lot of them.
[02:25:36.763 --> 02:25:42.745]  They're like, the people talking about freedom and the Constitution, they're the ones that blew up Oklahoma City!
[02:25:43.045 --> 02:25:43.785]  Yeah, right.
[02:25:44.046 --> 02:25:45.206]  That was Bill Clinton's people.
[02:25:46.106 --> 02:25:48.267]  So, this isn't a game.
[02:25:49.906 --> 02:25:58.329]  This isn't a game, and all of you that thought you'd sit on the bench, you'd sit on the sidelines, you'd stay out of the fight, you're the ones they're gonna gobble on first.
[02:25:58.949 --> 02:26:04.831]  And those of you that serve the evil, from my historical study, you are in the most dangerous position there is.
[02:26:05.271 --> 02:26:09.072]  The system eats its own more often than any other group.
[02:26:09.092 --> 02:26:13.154]  Alright, going back to Al and then others.
[02:26:13.354 --> 02:26:14.314]  Al, finish up your point.
[02:26:15.014 --> 02:26:17.976]  What they're doing, Alex, is they're eating out our sustenance, okay?
[02:26:18.036 --> 02:26:22.860]  People think that they're going to be pushing buttons and looking at computers the rest of their lives, and they're going to have it made.
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:23.800]  Let me tell you something.
[02:26:24.181 --> 02:26:27.523]  God, guns, and tools.
[02:26:27.843 --> 02:26:29.104]  You better know how to use them.
[02:26:29.124 --> 02:26:34.108]  You better know how to get out of the ground with some shelter if you really care about saving your family.
[02:26:34.128 --> 02:26:35.969]  And I have to tell you something.
[02:26:36.350 --> 02:26:43.395]  These colleges, Harvard, Oxford, Columbia, are indoctrinating and really putting out
[02:26:43.715 --> 02:26:46.037]  The nastiest kind of progressive leftists.
[02:26:46.558 --> 02:26:47.779]  Dangerous.
[02:26:47.819 --> 02:26:49.980]  Like I said, they're after us.
[02:26:50.921 --> 02:26:51.642]  It's not a game.
[02:26:52.122 --> 02:26:53.003]  It's not a joke.
[02:26:53.283 --> 02:26:55.525]  And it's not, you know, some psy-op.
[02:26:55.785 --> 02:26:59.589]  This is a real takedown of the human species all over the world.
[02:27:00.369 --> 02:27:01.991]  I really believe that Britain
[02:27:02.771 --> 02:27:03.091]  I think?
[02:27:21.007 --> 02:27:26.029]  And people need to know, this is not a guy in a Hitler outfit who, oh, there's the enemy, beat him.
[02:27:26.369 --> 02:27:33.031]  This is a system where they scientifically study us, and as you said, try to bring down the species itself.
[02:27:33.411 --> 02:27:35.432]  It is a rewriting of humanity.
[02:27:35.492 --> 02:27:39.693]  It is a final revolution of absolute pit-of-hell evil.
[02:27:40.413 --> 02:27:44.955]  I mean, this is unspeakable end of humanity as we know it if they win.
[02:27:45.695 --> 02:27:49.037]  I mean, this is absolute... It can only be Satan.
[02:27:49.458 --> 02:27:50.638]  I mean, it is Satan.
[02:27:52.099 --> 02:27:56.162]  Even if you don't believe in the devil, it might as well be a 5,000 foot black demon.
[02:27:56.262 --> 02:27:59.364]  I mean, you know, it's here, it's real, it wants death.
[02:28:00.045 --> 02:28:02.766]  The globalists want pain, suffering, death.
[02:28:03.026 --> 02:28:03.907]  They like to kill.
[02:28:03.947 --> 02:28:04.868]  They like ugliness.
[02:28:04.888 --> 02:28:05.668]  They like war.
[02:28:06.088 --> 02:28:06.769]  It's death.
[02:28:07.569 --> 02:28:12.032]  People just... I mean, I listen to how gullible and soft talk radio listeners are.
[02:28:12.052 --> 02:28:14.034]  How they call in and try to be cutesy and...
[02:28:15.596 --> 02:28:17.959]  How the talk shows talk to them like they're five years old.
[02:28:18.499 --> 02:28:24.226]  It's just so, I mean, oh, to see what they've done with TV and fluoride to the American people.
[02:28:24.686 --> 02:28:25.847]  Because the globalists hated us.
[02:28:25.867 --> 02:28:28.690]  We were the freest, most aggressive, most inventive people.
[02:28:28.770 --> 02:28:29.651]  We were the enemy.
[02:28:30.072 --> 02:28:34.677]  And now they took us over, they sold us out, and they turned us into jellyfish creatures.
[02:28:35.277 --> 02:28:40.921]  And then those of us that aren't jellyfish creatures, not that I'm some great guy, but compared to them, you know, we're in better shape.
[02:28:41.222 --> 02:28:47.767]  We are being absolutely demonized and giant armies of just murdering psychos are being ready for war with us.
[02:28:48.247 --> 02:28:58.194]  And the thing is, these control freaks, the murdering psychos, the Dudley Do-Right idiot robots, all of these different types they've got working for them, I don't even, they're just minions.
[02:28:58.735 --> 02:29:00.336]  They're not even worth anything.
[02:29:00.436 --> 02:29:02.458]  I don't, I'm not looking for some fight with them.
[02:29:03.323 --> 02:29:05.605]  I wish I could free their minds, free their souls.
[02:29:06.066 --> 02:29:09.149]  They are just fallen goblins.
[02:29:09.769 --> 02:29:12.672]  I mean, they are literally just tread grease to the New World Order.
[02:29:14.594 --> 02:29:15.395]  It's just so sad.
[02:29:15.415 --> 02:29:16.596]  It's so sad.
[02:29:16.616 --> 02:29:19.198]  And America is being judged.
[02:29:19.218 --> 02:29:21.180]  This is the beginning of the judgment of this country.
[02:29:21.661 --> 02:29:23.602]  And it is going to be absolute hell.
[02:29:24.323 --> 02:29:25.304]  I appreciate your call.
[02:29:25.504 --> 02:29:26.205]  Take a shot to break.
[02:29:26.245 --> 02:29:26.865]  Anything else, Al?
[02:29:28.203 --> 02:29:28.423]  Alex?
[02:29:28.864 --> 02:29:29.044]  Yeah?
[02:29:29.064 --> 02:29:30.625]  They're following the Hitler handbook.
[02:29:31.265 --> 02:29:33.547]  Anybody who doesn't know history better get into it.
[02:29:34.087 --> 02:29:34.728]  It's here.
[02:29:35.188 --> 02:29:36.088]  It's not coming.
[02:29:36.209 --> 02:29:37.309]  It's already here.
[02:29:37.369 --> 02:29:38.910]  It's been 30 years in the works.
[02:29:39.811 --> 02:29:43.013]  We are down on the back, on the mat.
[02:29:43.514 --> 02:29:44.134]  This is it.
[02:29:44.914 --> 02:29:49.658]  And the vampires are putting on their napkins around their necks and rubbing their hands together like giant rats.
[02:29:50.518 --> 02:29:51.419]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.919 --> 02:29:53.540]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.441 --> 02:29:57.143]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:01.036 --> 02:31:02.157]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:31:02.197 --> 02:31:08.884]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:31:08.904 --> 02:31:11.446]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:31:11.706 --> 02:31:16.871]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:31:17.071 --> 02:31:19.852]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:31:20.112 --> 02:31:22.233]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:31:22.433 --> 02:31:28.354]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:31:28.675 --> 02:31:31.896]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:31:32.056 --> 02:31:37.577]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:31:37.837 --> 02:31:39.158]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:31:39.478 --> 02:31:40.678]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:31:40.778 --> 02:31:43.299]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:31:43.459 --> 02:31:47.502]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:31:47.662 --> 02:31:52.165]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:52.285 --> 02:31:54.747]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:31:54.887 --> 02:31:58.590]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:31:58.750 --> 02:31:59.750]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:01.809 --> 02:32:03.291]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:03.511 --> 02:32:08.556]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:08.817 --> 02:32:10.178]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:10.358 --> 02:32:19.128]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:19.868 --> 02:32:26.973]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:27.413 --> 02:32:35.019]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:35.399 --> 02:32:40.342]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:40.643 --> 02:32:42.804]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:45.566 --> 02:32:48.470]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:32:48.791 --> 02:32:51.094]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:51.174 --> 02:32:53.277]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[02:33:12.999 --> 02:33:23.261]  Okay, I want to race through your calls so I can go through the rest of the news I haven't hit yet.
[02:33:25.082 --> 02:33:28.022]  And then we'll be back tonight with InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock.
[02:33:28.763 --> 02:33:29.983]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:33:30.103 --> 02:33:31.103]  I'm trying to be honest.
[02:33:31.843 --> 02:33:39.845]  And see, the Globalist, you can have 300 and something thousand people die from bad drug interactions every year, the media doesn't really report it, so nobody's worried about it.
[02:33:41.223 --> 02:33:45.390]  You can have a 3,000% increase in most forms of cancer in the last 30 years.
[02:33:45.951 --> 02:33:48.435]  Media has it as a footnote so people aren't worried about it.
[02:33:50.439 --> 02:33:53.504]  You can have governments stealing bank accounts and other things.
[02:33:54.983 --> 02:33:56.945]  Media doesn't make a big deal out of it, nobody cares.
[02:33:57.525 --> 02:34:05.451]  But they start hyperventilating about terrorist attacking and you got a better chance of being killed by honey bees or snake bites or whatever.
[02:34:06.312 --> 02:34:12.077]  It's way down the list of dangers, but it's so much fun to get scared and hate the foreigner.
[02:34:12.537 --> 02:34:13.898]  It's all manipulation.
[02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:20.584]  And then you look at who's actually funding Al Qaeda, and it's the globalists, the same banks that run us.
[02:34:21.687 --> 02:34:22.788]  And it's hidden right there.
[02:34:23.709 --> 02:34:26.711]  And a lot of good old boys, they don't really care about America.
[02:34:27.131 --> 02:34:30.094]  As long as they can hate Arabs, that's all they want.
[02:34:30.414 --> 02:34:32.116]  The government could take everything from them.
[02:34:32.316 --> 02:34:33.797]  Their children, their lives.
[02:34:34.277 --> 02:34:36.960]  As long as they can hate Arabs, they're happy.
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:45.306]  Of course, if they ever actually met the average Arab, they'd like them.
[02:34:45.366 --> 02:34:47.428]  It's pretty much like a Middle Eastern redneck or something.
[02:34:47.768 --> 02:34:49.109]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:34:50.174 --> 02:34:58.257]  That's what they want is that tribalism, because 5,000 years ago, if you didn't stick with your tribe when it was under attack, your tribe didn't survive.
[02:34:58.317 --> 02:34:59.858]  It is one of the strongest instincts.
[02:35:00.458 --> 02:35:00.859]  I get it.
[02:35:02.099 --> 02:35:06.541]  My country right or wrong, Al-Qaeda hit us, murder every brown person, they did it.
[02:35:09.122 --> 02:35:10.383]  And that is why we failed.
[02:35:11.783 --> 02:35:17.906]  And now they're going with tribalism with all these TV ads where every terrorist is white, middle-aged conservative white male or woman.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:20.341]  And the minorities like it just as much.
[02:35:20.361 --> 02:35:21.782]  They've been taught Whitey's out to get them.
[02:35:21.822 --> 02:35:23.904]  Whitey's been taught they're out to get them.
[02:35:23.944 --> 02:35:27.527]  And now, first they teach Whitey, the brown people are terrorists.
[02:35:27.567 --> 02:35:28.748]  Give your rights up to get them.
[02:35:28.828 --> 02:35:29.969]  Okay, get the brown people.
[02:35:30.510 --> 02:35:32.531]  Even if you're not even racist, it's more of a tribalism.
[02:35:33.192 --> 02:35:34.333]  Then they've gone to the brown people.
[02:35:34.393 --> 02:35:35.394]  Okay, now it's Whitey.
[02:35:35.614 --> 02:35:37.475]  They're like, all right, I understand Whitey's a terrorist.
[02:35:37.515 --> 02:35:38.176]  Now you're talking.
[02:35:38.896 --> 02:35:40.418]  Now see, everybody's a terrorist.
[02:35:40.458 --> 02:35:41.278]  And we have this article.
[02:35:41.298 --> 02:35:43.740]  In fact, I don't think we printed it.
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:45.061]  I've gone through all my news.
[02:35:46.287 --> 02:35:47.768]  I don't think so.
[02:35:57.952 --> 02:35:58.893]  Tell ya, he could win, folks.
[02:35:58.913 --> 02:36:00.273]  He could win the Republican nomination.
[02:36:00.474 --> 02:36:03.515]  MF Global looted customers' accounts via internal bank run.
[02:36:04.076 --> 02:36:08.178]  DOJ make it a federal crime to lie on the internet.
[02:36:08.598 --> 02:36:11.260]  Jim Rogers on why there's no way to stop global meltdown.
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:16.023]  DHS link group trains citizens their best pal could be a terrorist.
[02:36:16.043 --> 02:36:16.883]  Yeah, that's the article.
[02:36:18.784 --> 02:36:23.187]  And there it is, telling you that you can't trust anybody but government.
[02:36:25.566 --> 02:36:28.207]  You can't trust anybody, and that's what the telescreens tell you now.
[02:36:28.547 --> 02:36:29.708]  They're putting up in public places.
[02:36:30.088 --> 02:36:31.889]  No one can be trusted but the government.
[02:36:32.269 --> 02:36:35.511]  You mean the government that got the underwear bomber on the plane on Christmas Day?
[02:36:35.531 --> 02:36:36.671]  You mean that's on record?
[02:36:36.691 --> 02:36:39.233]  That's on record?
[02:36:40.133 --> 02:36:44.035]  You mean the government that got the shoe bomber on the plane on record?
[02:36:44.055 --> 02:36:51.759]  The government that protected Major Hassan for two years when they knew what he was planning and declared national security on it?
[02:36:51.779 --> 02:36:52.459]  You mean that government?
[02:36:54.517 --> 02:36:55.537]  Yeah, I mean that government.
[02:36:57.038 --> 02:37:04.921]  It's not a government, it's a collection of criminals that took over the government and are now disassembling checks and balances, the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:37:08.182 --> 02:37:16.545]  And then the last 40 years they did psychological tests to not hire tough guys like they used to to be cops, but now they've hired
[02:37:18.211 --> 02:37:18.992]  Sociopaths.
[02:37:19.553 --> 02:37:23.016]  Brutal people who enjoy the raw exercise of power.
[02:37:23.377 --> 02:37:25.659]  And our journey into hell is almost complete.
[02:37:29.824 --> 02:37:30.765]  Almost complete.
[02:37:33.408 --> 02:37:37.572]  If they keep moving this fast, there'll be a day you're not going to hear me or anybody else on the air.
[02:37:37.993 --> 02:37:39.595]  And the real darkness is going to settle.
[02:37:40.555 --> 02:37:42.376]  And they're going to scare you with bioweapon releases.
[02:37:42.396 --> 02:37:45.617]  They're going to have a whole cocktail of ways to get you lined up.
[02:37:45.637 --> 02:37:48.798]  And they're going to blame those that won't take the vaccines for it spreading.
[02:37:49.899 --> 02:37:51.379]  I can foresee their entire plan.
[02:37:51.419 --> 02:37:52.460]  Just think like the enemy.
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:53.700]  Study the enemy.
[02:37:53.980 --> 02:37:54.761]  Think like the enemy.
[02:37:54.881 --> 02:37:55.821]  I'm in their mind.
[02:37:55.881 --> 02:37:56.942]  I see through their eyes.
[02:37:57.502 --> 02:37:58.602]  And it is horrible.
[02:37:59.362 --> 02:38:01.443]  And all they see is all the innocents they get to hurt.
[02:38:01.823 --> 02:38:02.944]  All the people they get to torture.
[02:38:03.384 --> 02:38:05.445]  The journey is the destination for these people.
[02:38:06.274 --> 02:38:10.916]  They're priests of power, always pressing on the nerve of power, always trampling and being trampled.
[02:38:11.536 --> 02:38:17.399]  A society that measures success by how much they degenerate, how much they fall apart.
[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:21.941]  You're like, that's an extreme view of history.
[02:38:21.961 --> 02:38:22.181]  Really?
[02:38:22.501 --> 02:38:26.263]  That's the norm when good people don't stand up and band together.
[02:38:26.783 --> 02:38:28.704]  That's the norm when you don't have morals.
[02:38:31.550 --> 02:38:35.091]  We have allowed evil in, it has grown, it has taken over the high places.
[02:38:35.451 --> 02:38:38.011]  America is now a command base of pure evil.
[02:38:39.371 --> 02:38:40.492]  And so are most other countries.
[02:38:40.512 --> 02:38:45.653]  You know, one of their most elementary manipulations is to point out some other evil country and say, well, choose a side.
[02:38:46.033 --> 02:38:51.114]  Choose a side, it's all... Give up my rights or whatever because of some foreign enemy?
[02:38:52.474 --> 02:38:55.274]  As if, if I'm against a new war, I'm for that enemy?
[02:38:55.594 --> 02:38:55.834]  No!
[02:38:56.895 --> 02:38:59.035]  I'm not for that enemy and I'm not for you either!
[02:39:07.056 --> 02:39:09.419]  We'll go to your calls here in a moment and then back into that news.
[02:39:09.779 --> 02:39:10.861]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[02:41:21.863 --> 02:41:24.344]  Hey Alex, you're a true American patriot and humanity's best friend.
[02:41:50.339 --> 02:41:52.340]  Hey, I have a question and a couple comments.
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:59.422]  I've been trying to figure out if something is true, so I had framed this question in a way that if it is, all you have to do is answer yes or no.
[02:41:59.622 --> 02:42:00.442]  I know for sure.
[02:42:01.542 --> 02:42:05.583]  Are you under a gag order to not mention anything about the Nassara Law?
[02:42:06.263 --> 02:42:06.504]  No.
[02:42:07.384 --> 02:42:07.624]  No?
[02:42:08.564 --> 02:42:18.827]  Well, I talked to Kurt about this during the Money Bomb, and there's a movie, a documentary on YouTube called Changes on the Horizon.
[02:42:20.425 --> 02:42:22.207]  And it's quite interesting.
[02:42:22.247 --> 02:42:26.912]  I highly recommend you watch that and then kind of report and do some research.
[02:42:27.012 --> 02:42:28.674]  I'm trying to figure out if it's true or not.
[02:42:28.734 --> 02:42:31.737]  No, I can tell you right now, Nassera is not real.
[02:42:31.798 --> 02:42:32.959]  It's been around 15 years.
[02:42:32.999 --> 02:42:38.565]  They always say there's a secret group, a reorganization America, that's going to fix everything.
[02:42:38.585 --> 02:42:41.788]  And that's a globalist disinfo that good people pick up and repeat.
[02:42:42.449 --> 02:42:46.452]  So that when they reorganize America, people will believe that that's Nassera.
[02:42:46.912 --> 02:42:58.139]  This is a planted, kind of Missionaria Protectorate type plan where they pre-plant the legends so that people then accept them once it's announced.
[02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:03.963]  So it's just like the infiltration of Christianity and planting false doctrine so people stand down.
[02:43:03.983 --> 02:43:07.986]  But listen, I've been under one gag order
[02:43:09.079 --> 02:43:11.061]  And I've told people I was under a gag order.
[02:43:11.101 --> 02:43:14.684]  That was a week before the Obama deception was set to come out.
[02:43:15.104 --> 02:43:17.867]  The FBI showed up here asking about the Obama deception.
[02:43:17.887 --> 02:43:20.169]  Well, they asked about it over the phone, then they showed up.
[02:43:20.810 --> 02:43:21.770]  And I said, what's this about?
[02:43:21.810 --> 02:43:23.272]  And they said, here's the federal court order.
[02:43:24.873 --> 02:43:25.374]  We want
[02:43:26.613 --> 02:43:33.939]  These particular IP addresses, here's the court order, had my lawyer checked it, and they want to know about Obama deception and these IP addresses.
[02:43:33.959 --> 02:43:37.362]  Then I went on air and I said the FBI was here, but it's a gag order.
[02:43:37.783 --> 02:43:42.507]  And then the disinfo said I was lying and you know that I was making it up to promote Obama deception.
[02:43:42.527 --> 02:43:46.150]  And then six months later it came out in the Associated Press, gag order was lifted.
[02:43:46.730 --> 02:43:58.841]  I guess it was lifted because it was in the Associated Press that some idiot listener was saying kill cops and giving the home address of the cop that shot the guy in the back and tried to cover it up out in San Francisco on the train platform.
[02:43:59.802 --> 02:44:03.605]  And he gave his name, everything, and it turned out he'd been in some crazy trouble before.
[02:44:03.866 --> 02:44:06.728]  Probably not all there.
[02:44:07.068 --> 02:44:08.890]  But the cops were using it as an excuse.
[02:44:09.451 --> 02:44:11.633]  Why do you got posters of Obama up on the wall?
[02:44:12.173 --> 02:44:14.255]  And I was like, well, that's for promotion of the new movie coming out.
[02:44:14.315 --> 02:44:14.495]  Really?
[02:44:14.515 --> 02:44:15.336]  You promote things in here?
[02:44:15.356 --> 02:44:16.877]  And I go, yeah, I shoot video in front of it.
[02:44:17.617 --> 02:44:19.839]  And I said, and then they were trying to ask my employees questions.
[02:44:19.859 --> 02:44:21.741]  And I said, they'll twist it and say you're lying to them.
[02:44:21.981 --> 02:44:22.942]  Don't answer their questions.
[02:44:22.962 --> 02:44:27.225]  I said, the government, it's drug dealers and murderers and ships guns into Mexico.
[02:44:27.445 --> 02:44:29.026]  And the FBI guys were looking at me like this.
[02:44:29.046 --> 02:44:30.768]  He had an Austin cop with him, a detective.
[02:44:31.068 --> 02:44:34.050]  And that guy was playing good cop with me and all this crud.
[02:44:34.651 --> 02:44:35.872]  They were like little children.
[02:44:35.892 --> 02:44:37.613]  They had the eyes of five-year-olds.
[02:44:37.633 --> 02:44:38.173]  They were weak.
[02:44:38.934 --> 02:44:40.777]  I wanted to see life in them and liberty.
[02:44:40.817 --> 02:44:42.279]  Instead they were like little children here.
[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:45.223]  And here's your gag order and all this crud.
[02:44:45.263 --> 02:44:46.845]  Some other FBI guy called me the next day.
[02:44:47.045 --> 02:44:48.147]  Now don't talk about it.
[02:44:48.207 --> 02:44:49.148]  Don't say anything.
[02:44:50.390 --> 02:44:54.035]  So they were using one thing as an excuse to make me think it was about another.
[02:44:54.836 --> 02:44:58.277]  And it didn't matter, because it did turn into hype for Obama deception.
[02:44:58.357 --> 02:45:09.301]  I came out and said, film isn't exactly ready, but we're going to go ahead and release it a couple days early, because the FBI was just here, and everybody went crazy, so it got more views than any other film I've ever put out for free online.
[02:45:09.921 --> 02:45:11.862]  It's over 35 million last time I counted them all up.
[02:45:12.522 --> 02:45:14.983]  You know, one video alone has nine and a half million.
[02:45:15.603 --> 02:45:19.565]  And, you know, and they were trying to intimidate us at first, and I just started basically
[02:45:20.205 --> 02:45:21.646]  Yes sir, and a couple comments I have is...
[02:45:41.435 --> 02:45:46.257]  G. Edward Griffin's got a project going that I think you should promote.
[02:45:46.617 --> 02:45:50.518]  It's Project City Hall at blogspot.com.
[02:45:51.258 --> 02:46:00.201]  And also I think you ought to promote phone.ronpaw2012.com because people could do phone bank for him from home.
[02:46:00.221 --> 02:46:01.581]  That'd help out getting him
[02:46:01.861 --> 02:46:02.441]  Absolutely.
[02:46:02.481 --> 02:46:03.442]  He's getting close.
[02:46:03.482 --> 02:46:05.563]  He's winning first and second place now.
[02:46:05.863 --> 02:46:08.245]  They're freaking out and it's barely getting attention.
[02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:10.946]  We've got articles at InfoWars.com about it right now.
[02:46:10.986 --> 02:46:11.567]  Thank you, Scott.
[02:46:13.588 --> 02:46:14.268]  Or was that Mike?
[02:46:14.428 --> 02:46:16.409]  I can't even keep track of it.
[02:46:16.670 --> 02:46:17.690]  Who was that I was just talking to?
[02:46:17.710 --> 02:46:19.691]  Okay, that was Scott.
[02:46:19.711 --> 02:46:20.192]  I got it right.
[02:46:20.272 --> 02:46:21.673]  Okay, now it's Mike in Oklahoma.
[02:46:22.013 --> 02:46:23.634]  This new phone system confuses me.
[02:46:24.054 --> 02:46:24.814]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:46:24.854 --> 02:46:25.255]  Go ahead.
[02:46:26.575 --> 02:46:26.835]  Alec.
[02:46:27.276 --> 02:46:27.516]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:29.102 --> 02:46:30.463]  I can't believe I'm talking to you.
[02:46:30.504 --> 02:46:31.945]  Hey, excellent show.
[02:46:32.445 --> 02:46:33.567]  Never heard nothing like it.
[02:46:35.448 --> 02:46:36.329]  I got a question.
[02:46:36.590 --> 02:46:39.172]  How do I contact you?
[02:46:40.213 --> 02:46:41.475]  Because I cannot see.
[02:46:42.576 --> 02:46:45.398]  And I'm listening to you on shortwave.
[02:46:46.800 --> 02:46:48.702]  Chemtrails, fluoride.
[02:46:51.218 --> 02:46:52.839]  I've never heard nothing like ya.
[02:46:52.879 --> 02:46:54.339]  Well, you're asking how you contact me.
[02:46:54.379 --> 02:46:55.500]  By the way, you can see.
[02:46:55.780 --> 02:46:56.941]  Your soul can see.
[02:46:57.421 --> 02:46:59.882]  You have discernment, and you can see better than most.
[02:47:00.742 --> 02:47:02.123]  But you say, how do you contact me?
[02:47:02.163 --> 02:47:08.106]  Sir, I literally, on average, work from 6 a.m.
[02:47:08.246 --> 02:47:10.167]  until 8 p.m.
[02:47:10.747 --> 02:47:12.568]  So, however many hours that is a day.
[02:47:12.728 --> 02:47:14.669]  You know, 15 hours, 16 hours.
[02:47:15.209 --> 02:47:17.030]  So, I don't have time to be on the phone with people.
[02:47:17.730 --> 02:47:18.930]  But we're talking here right now.
[02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.771]  Go ahead and talk to me.
[02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:22.292]  Can you put the number on the radio?
[02:47:22.312 --> 02:47:23.553]  I can't see.
[02:47:24.173 --> 02:47:26.715]  Oh, you mean the number to call in or the number to... What number?
[02:47:27.456 --> 02:47:29.257]  To contact you.
[02:47:29.398 --> 02:47:31.800]  I want stickers and t-shirts and hats.
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:32.740]  Oh, I understand.
[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.862]  Well, I'll tell you what, sir.
[02:47:36.003 --> 02:47:42.188]  If you call right now... This is... I know what it is.
[02:47:42.208 --> 02:47:44.290]  The phone system keeps moving the callers around.
[02:47:44.310 --> 02:47:45.171]  That's driving me crazy.
[02:47:45.591 --> 02:47:46.972]  Mike in Oklahoma, I'll be happy.
[02:47:47.952 --> 02:47:51.056]  Just send you some free hats and bumper stickers.
[02:47:51.096 --> 02:47:51.697]  How does that sound?
[02:47:52.839 --> 02:47:54.341]  That's alright, but I'll pay for them.
[02:47:54.381 --> 02:48:00.469]  But anyway, I listened to you on shortwave and I never heard nothing like it.
[02:48:03.557 --> 02:48:04.238]  Keep going, Dave.
[02:48:04.438 --> 02:48:08.521]  Well, this is what somebody who's not doing a fake entertainment radio show sounds like.
[02:48:08.921 --> 02:48:15.706]  I'm here, the evil's closing in, and liberty's rising as well, but not fast enough, and I'm just in here wartime broadcaster.
[02:48:15.906 --> 02:48:17.987]  Enemy forces are doing this, now they're doing that.
[02:48:18.228 --> 02:48:20.549]  Try to awaken whoever you can who isn't under their trance.
[02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:23.031]  I'm Alex Jones reporting for InfoWars.com.
[02:48:23.211 --> 02:48:25.173]  I mean, this is what it's like to have chills.
[02:48:25.213 --> 02:48:26.814]  This is what it's like to be real.
[02:48:26.854 --> 02:48:29.436]  This is what it's like to ask God to give you discernment.
[02:48:29.756 --> 02:48:32.558]  This is what it's like to really lift the veil of mind control.
[02:48:32.938 --> 02:48:35.160]  That's why you're hearing something so new.
[02:48:35.540 --> 02:48:36.801]  Because it's desperation.
[02:48:37.242 --> 02:48:39.103]  It's the Alamo writing letters every day.
[02:48:39.364 --> 02:48:40.965]  Help us, we can't hold out long.
[02:48:41.385 --> 02:48:42.787]  You know, America's going down.
[02:48:43.087 --> 02:48:46.330]  Please, please, please, help America, help the world.
[02:48:46.630 --> 02:48:55.678]  And the yuppies are still partying and giggling and snickering and, you know, the liberals are running around loving communism and the mainline Republicans are loving their globalist handlers.
[02:48:56.138 --> 02:48:56.699]  It's a nightmare.
[02:48:56.739 --> 02:48:58.981]  But let me give you the toll-free number for folks that want to call and order stuff.
[02:49:01.608 --> 02:49:04.871]  Mike, I'll send you a free bumper sticker and some ball caps.
[02:49:05.471 --> 02:49:05.651]  It's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:05.671 --> 02:49:05.711]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:05.731 --> 02:49:06.312]  Did you get that?
[02:49:06.332 --> 02:49:06.452]  2-5-8-3-1-3-9?
[02:49:06.472 --> 02:49:06.512]  888-253-3139.
[02:49:06.532 --> 02:49:08.955]  I'd love to give everybody everything free.
[02:49:21.485 --> 02:49:21.845]  I like orange.
[02:49:21.885 --> 02:49:22.745]  Hey, I'm right up the street.
[02:49:22.765 --> 02:49:22.865]  Delta.
[02:49:48.473 --> 02:49:54.678]  I never heard nobody like you and I'm right here waiting to back you up.
[02:49:55.218 --> 02:49:56.919]  Well thank you my friend, God bless you.
[02:49:58.501 --> 02:49:59.842]  Let's jam in another one as we got a break.
[02:49:59.882 --> 02:50:01.343]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:50:03.084 --> 02:50:07.707]  Hello Alex, I just wanted to give you two points and one question maybe you can direct us.
[02:50:08.568 --> 02:50:12.651]  I wanted to let you know I had a revelation about a year ago that we had a
[02:50:15.845 --> 02:50:19.127]  I want to hear this because I don't get into this on air but

[02:52:06.134 --> 02:52:06.574]  What then?

[02:53:04.763 --> 02:53:10.165]  Are you still smelling up your clothes and car interior, staining your teeth, and getting ashes everywhere?
[02:53:10.785 --> 02:53:11.086]  Why?

[02:54:11.343 --> 02:54:12.563]  George in Connecticut.
[02:54:12.583 --> 02:54:14.104]  Go ahead and finish up your point.
[02:54:37.034 --> 02:54:39.556]  Well, I was told that they had already lost.
[02:54:39.596 --> 02:54:44.099]  We won't see the time or the hour yet, but they've already basically lost.
[02:54:44.659 --> 02:54:47.101]  And the confirmation came when I was sitting in a library.
[02:54:47.121 --> 02:54:59.629]  It says, turn around, and there was a line of Russian authors, and the one author, Vladimir Nabokov, I pulled it out as directed, and the name of the book was Tyrants Destroyed.
[02:55:00.129 --> 02:55:08.417]  The confirmation, it says open the book and the chapter I opened with my last name, the same name of Michelle Bachman.
[02:55:08.757 --> 02:55:10.239]  The chapter is named Bachman.
[02:55:10.599 --> 02:55:12.901]  Anybody can confirm it who doesn't believe it.
[02:55:14.903 --> 02:55:15.183]  Hello?
[02:55:15.484 --> 02:55:16.505]  No, I'm just listening to you.
[02:55:16.525 --> 02:55:17.305]  I'm just thinking about it.
[02:55:17.345 --> 02:55:17.786]  Amazing.
[02:55:18.126 --> 02:55:19.087]  That's a great title.
[02:55:19.127 --> 02:55:20.108]  Tyrants Destroyed.
[02:55:20.148 --> 02:55:20.829]  I want to read that.
[02:55:21.954 --> 02:55:36.579]  Yeah, and the other point I wanted to make is that there was a great, Catherine Orpshon-Fifth had done a two-part, hour-long thing with a gal, I can't remember the gal's name unfortunately, but her radio show's called Guns and Butter.
[02:55:37.019 --> 02:55:40.360]  It's broadcast on the West Coast and the East Coast on WBAI.
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:49.923]  I think you should get her on because it was so fantastic how she laid out how the whole financial situation was fabricated, how they did it, how they manipulated
[02:55:50.223 --> 02:55:55.947]  No, I'm gonna get Fitz back on and then she's also got ideas for citizens legally to be able to defeat it.
[02:55:55.967 --> 02:55:57.568]  In fact, let's get Fitz on next week.
[02:55:57.988 --> 02:56:05.112]  Tell her I heard like two weeks ago on Riley getting into these different ways for the citizens to demand the debts be written off of the counties and cities.
[02:56:05.572 --> 02:56:07.494]  I'm gonna get Fitz on for an hour next week sometime.
[02:56:07.794 --> 02:56:08.994]  Great points, good to hear from you.
[02:56:09.935 --> 02:56:10.876]  Who's up next here?
[02:56:11.476 --> 02:56:13.277]  Steve in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:56:14.418 --> 02:56:15.799]  Hey, how's it going Alex, can you hear me?
[02:56:15.939 --> 02:56:16.199]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:17.182 --> 02:56:26.789]  Hey, I just wanted to call and let you know about the conference we had at Chattanooga, University of Tennessee Chattanooga, with architects and engineers.
[02:56:28.010 --> 02:56:29.612]  Basically, it was standing room only.
[02:56:30.592 --> 02:56:34.615]  The students were doing it for extra credit, and they had a debate.
[02:56:35.676 --> 02:56:46.485]  Had an engineer there that apparently didn't do his homework, because he was easily put in his place when he tried to debunk the whole 9-11 theory.
[02:56:47.968 --> 02:56:56.182]  Um, but basically, I'm with Weird Change of Tennessee, and, you know, if we can get more Weird Change groups across the country...
[02:56:58.326 --> 02:57:14.580]  Sure, you can call it whatever you want, but political activism, exposing the globalist crimes, that's the key.
[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:15.241]  Great idea.
[02:57:15.261 --> 02:57:19.824]  I want to jam in everybody here, because I've got to do a TV interview after this, so I've got to end here in just a moment.
[02:57:20.565 --> 02:57:22.247]  Let's talk to Otter Enmasse.
[02:57:22.427 --> 02:57:23.247]  Otter, you're on the air.
[02:57:23.287 --> 02:57:23.588]  Go ahead.
[02:57:24.861 --> 02:57:26.242]  Hey, you broke up there.
[02:57:26.262 --> 02:57:26.763]  You're still there?
[02:57:27.063 --> 02:57:27.523]  Yes, Otter.
[02:57:27.583 --> 02:57:27.944]  Welcome.
[02:57:28.144 --> 02:57:28.644]  All righty.
[02:57:29.084 --> 02:57:29.965]  How are you today?
[02:57:29.985 --> 02:57:30.826]  I'm good.
[02:57:30.846 --> 02:57:31.887]  Fired up.
[02:57:33.108 --> 02:57:34.709]  Uh, Gerald, my God.
[02:57:35.610 --> 02:57:35.730]  Um...
[02:57:36.849 --> 02:57:41.291]  I like the idea you have in a recent show about IP addresses and the feedback that you get.
[02:57:41.331 --> 02:57:44.113]  I read a lot of the feedback on the InfoWars page.
[02:57:44.873 --> 02:57:49.895]  And a lot of the disinformation lists and the multiple posts and maybe multiple individuals.
[02:57:49.915 --> 02:57:58.139]  Yeah, I need to do a report on that showing how it'll be one IP address with 20 different names having fake conversations with themselves to create false consensus.
[02:57:58.499 --> 02:58:00.560]  And a lot of times they don't even shield the IPs.
[02:58:00.841 --> 02:58:03.482]  They go to governments, think tanks, PR firms.
[02:58:05.472 --> 02:58:05.873]  I don't know.
[02:58:05.953 --> 02:58:08.055]  Some kind of software programs, I believe.
[02:58:08.756 --> 02:58:12.701]  It seems like... I see a number of these across the internet.
[02:58:12.801 --> 02:58:14.183]  Yeah, they call them shot puppets.
[02:58:14.223 --> 02:58:15.264]  The Pentagon runs those.
[02:58:15.604 --> 02:58:17.186]  And they attack anything pro-America.
[02:58:17.527 --> 02:58:20.010]  While the Pentagon wraps itself in the American flag all day.
[02:58:21.015 --> 02:58:21.435]  I agree.
[02:58:21.755 --> 02:58:23.956]  So, Oklahoma City was the other thought I had.
[02:58:23.996 --> 02:58:31.060]  I'm wondering why there hasn't been more of, like, 9-11 change, and 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:37.643]  Why more haven't... Because that happened before the true awakening to government-sponsored terror began.
[02:58:37.903 --> 02:58:40.264]  See you tonight, 7 o'clock Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:58:41.765 --> 02:58:42.565]  Great job, crew.
