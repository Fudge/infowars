[00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:05.773]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:07.495]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:09.356]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:10.797]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.557 --> 00:00:13.039]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.721]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.302 --> 00:00:21.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:29.483]  It is Thursday, the 25th day.
[00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:33.001]  of August 2011.
[00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.783]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:53.291]  Nomi Prins, who was a managing director at Goldman Sachs, and has written a recent article dealing with the fact that there are reports that the head of Goldman Sachs may be on the verge of being indicted after he hired the former head Enron defense attorney.
[00:00:53.811 --> 00:01:00.295]  Nomi Prins, with all of her inside knowledge, will be joining us for 30 minutes, coming up in about an hour and a half from now.
[00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:07.438]  And also looking at the economy, and a big report that he's written ten years later, what we've learned about 9-11.
[00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:10.359]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will also be popping in.
[00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:20.403]  But we're going to have wide open phones, and I do want to try to go to your calls early in this hour, so I will open the phones up when we start the next segment.
[00:01:20.423 --> 00:01:21.264]  They're not open yet.
[00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:25.105]  On all the news we've got here, some interesting news.
[00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:28.447]  You know, I already knew this, but when we would talk about it,
[00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:32.309]  People would act like we were making it up or something.
[00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:35.330]  But it's official.
[00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.611]  Human activity can cause earthquakes.
[00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:47.696]  And this is a statement by the USGS, the New York Times, and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
[00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:53.474]  And there's a nice boil down by Washington's blog that we've got linked at Infowars.com.
[00:01:54.335 --> 00:02:07.519]  And yesterday I read, buried in a Denver Post article, they had the USGS mentioning the fact that earthquakes
[00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:11.978]  Can be triggered by human activity, so we'll go over the different types of that.
[00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:15.219]  Also, more cracks found in Washington Monument.
[00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.939]  That's being reported on by the D.C.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880]  Park police and officials.
[00:02:23.801 --> 00:02:31.623]  Also, there were more aftershocks yesterday, as big as 4.5 after the 5.8 that hit two days ago.
[00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:36.524]  So we're going to be looking at those interesting articles as well.
[00:02:37.364 --> 00:02:40.425]  This is a hurricane prepares to slam into the East Coast.
[00:02:41.245 --> 00:02:43.766]  Obviously, we have the financial news I want to get into.
[00:02:44.707 --> 00:02:53.230]  Steve Jobs, who's been battling and looked like defeating cancer, pancreatic cancer, that 95% of people die in about a year from.
[00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.853]  He's lived, what, six, seven years ever supposedly defeating it and getting a liver transplant and other things, though he's looked very, very thin and unhealthy.
[00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:13.092]  Has now said that the time has come for him to step down as the CEO of one of the biggest corporations in the world, second largest public corporation, and that of course is Apple.
[00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:18.960]  And he says the time has come for him not to be, because he can't continue his duties to step down.
[00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:28.789]  I started doing an open letter to Steve Jobs this morning and then handed it off to Paul Watson to try to codify it because I ran out of time.
[00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:31.412]  And so Watson's working on that.
[00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:34.335]  It should be done by the end of the broadcast today or earlier.
[00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:38.158]  And so I'll cover it today during the show if we're able to.
[00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:42.543]  If not, I will cover it tonight during the special report.
[00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:47.257]  Now special reports can be 10 minutes long, 30 minutes long, two hours long.
[00:03:47.297 --> 00:03:53.622]  We've basically are beta testing some of the new systems in the new studio.
[00:03:55.064 --> 00:03:57.085]  We have several different studio setups over there.
[00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:00.709]  So these are really preludes to the nightly news that kicks off.
[00:04:02.552 --> 00:04:06.915]  Thursday September 1st next Thursday and many days.
[00:04:06.975 --> 00:04:24.207]  It'll just be the 30-minute condensed focused hard-hitting transmission But at other times we'll tag on special reports to the end of it as well But we do have some interviews coming up this evening Also during the special report 7 o'clock central 8 p.m.
[00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:31.491]  Eastern what six mountain five Pacific at prison planet dot TV
[00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:41.657]  Because we have the responsibility to really condense the information we cover in a long form on three hours on the radio every day and cover breaking news at night.
[00:04:41.697 --> 00:04:43.477]  We also come in Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:04:43.497 --> 00:04:52.602]  with the radio show because we're fully dedicated to chronicling and tracking the globalist activities and trying to organize peaceful resistance and awakening to what they're doing.
[00:04:53.282 --> 00:04:55.804]  With the latest on Libya and a lot more, straight ahead.
[00:04:55.824 --> 00:04:56.264]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:02.930]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.196]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.456 --> 00:05:09.838]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:18.788]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:26.614]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.054 --> 00:05:34.659]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:39.982]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:01.170]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.893]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:10.414]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:10.695 --> 00:06:15.897]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:18.859]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:21.180]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.364]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:30.887]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.047 --> 00:06:36.591]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:38.152]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:39.693]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:39.773 --> 00:06:42.335]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:42.455 --> 00:06:46.518]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:46.678 --> 00:06:49.300]  You can find the video at www dot
[00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.161]  Endofamerica3.com.
[00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:53.742]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:06:59.784 --> 00:07:03.125]  Hi folks, Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.
[00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:08.347]  In August, we're celebrating our 30-year anniversary in the long-term food supply industry.

[00:07:22.593 --> 00:07:25.574]  That's lower than 1981 prices.
[00:07:25.874 --> 00:07:29.436]  If you ever thought about getting a year's supply of food, now is the time.

[00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.439]  You know you need your own food.

[00:07:47.183 --> 00:07:50.085]  Call 800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.903]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.503 --> 00:08:11.505]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.242 --> 00:08:20.064]  It is Thursday, the 25th day of August 2011.
[00:08:20.604 --> 00:08:26.148]  Nomi Prins, former managing director of Goldman Sachs, will be joining us.
[00:08:26.788 --> 00:08:41.098]  She's got a lot of the inside baseball on whether the head of Goldman Sachs is going to be indicted for the admitted crimes committed by Goldman Sachs, selling fraudulent derivatives into the world market to private investors and government alike.
[00:08:41.558 --> 00:08:46.822]  She's going to be joining us coming up in about an hour and a half from now, and then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts via video, Skype,
[00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:54.627]  We'll also be joining us former head of policy at the Department of the Treasury, former Wall Street Journal editor.
[00:08:55.208 --> 00:09:03.214]  He's written a new article today that appears at InfoWars.com and it's titled 9-1-1
[00:09:05.134 --> 00:09:07.878]  After a decade, have we learned anything?
[00:09:08.419 --> 00:09:12.184]  Again, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts will be joining us.
[00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:13.666]  Here's the article by Nomi Prince.
[00:09:13.726 --> 00:09:15.909]  Could Blankfein face prison?
[00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.054]  Show that is coming up today.
[00:09:21.414 --> 00:09:25.356]  Ron Paul was on Lou Dobbs last night, and Real Clear Politics has it.
[00:09:25.736 --> 00:09:26.797]  We may play the clip later.
[00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:30.539]  If not, it's also up at Infowars.com.
[00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:41.084]  And he was asked by Lou Dobbs on Fox Business whether he thinks there's going to be riots in this country because of the inflation tax, because of dollar devaluation.
[00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:50.069]  And Ron Paul goes on to say, yes, the inflation tax will end up triggering, he believes, civil unrest in this country, mainly from the welfare class,
[00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:56.436]  When their welfare checks are still delivered but are devalued.
[00:09:57.277 --> 00:10:04.985]  And of course over the weekend we wrote an article and it got a lot of attention with Ron Paul talking about the fact that the FEMA camps are for
[00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:10.708]  The imploding of society and that's basically what Homeland Security wants.
[00:10:10.788 --> 00:10:15.329]  So Ron Paul has basically commented more on that issue.
[00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:21.411]  Ron Paul is, as Lou Dobbs pointed out last night, is number one, number two or number three in all the polls.
[00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:32.334]  But Rick Perry in a new Gallup poll has surged with a big lead into the first place, which shows with a lot of Americans, they still go off, quote, looks.
[00:10:33.864 --> 00:10:40.089]  I mean, I guess to some people, the Captain Morgan-esque look of Rick Perry looks better than Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.592]  It just shows you that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
[00:10:46.513 --> 00:10:53.358]  But there's no doubt that in the last few months of the media, as Pew Research documented, has totally ignored Ron Paul.
[00:10:53.978 --> 00:10:58.942]  When they do cover him, and he gets the least coverage of any candidate, it's almost all negative.
[00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:06.451]  Unless it's a Lou Dobbs or an Alex Jones or a Judge Andrew Napolitano.
[00:11:07.898 --> 00:11:12.922]  And that shows how the image makers are still trying to cram their candidates down our throat.
[00:11:13.263 --> 00:11:17.106]  But Ron Paul is getting a lot more attention than he did three and a half years ago.
[00:11:17.546 --> 00:11:22.491]  So that is extremely positive, and we've got to get the word out about Rick Perry.
[00:11:22.571 --> 00:11:25.053]  I told you he was going to run for president.
[00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:27.735]  I told you the pledge was fake, that he would break it.
[00:11:27.755 --> 00:11:28.736]  He always intended to.
[00:11:28.756 --> 00:11:31.278]  I told you he would go into the lead.
[00:11:32.319 --> 00:11:34.980]  And that's what the top Republican strategists believe.
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.100]  And that's what some of them have told me.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.281]  I live here in Austin, Texas, where Rick Perry has been the governor for 10 years.
[00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:43.922]  I live in the Capitol.
[00:11:44.602 --> 00:11:45.762]  I do have a lot of sources.
[00:11:46.402 --> 00:11:54.884]  And I'm told that not only is he going to be the frontrunner, which he is now, that he would run, be the frontrunner, and that he was designed to knock Ron Paul out.
[00:11:55.905 --> 00:12:02.208]  He's a weapon system to co-opt the Tea Party and true conservatives and libertarians and constitutionalist ideas.
[00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:04.890]  That's why he's taking on the Federal Reserve.
[00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:07.591]  That's why he's talking about the New World Order and stuff.
[00:12:08.071 --> 00:12:13.154]  It is pure, pure camouflage for what he really is and what he really stands for.
[00:12:13.514 --> 00:12:16.616]  And we've got to get the real record of Rick Perry out now.
[00:12:17.857 --> 00:12:22.219]  But if mainline Republicans embrace Mitt Romney or Rick Perry, as some of them are doing,
[00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:25.471]  You've got to say they get what they deserve.
[00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:28.734]  The problem is, though, they're dragging us all along with them.
[00:12:28.894 --> 00:12:41.445]  I mean, we have got to continue to reach out to people with the fact that Mitt Romney wrote Obamacare and that his model that he wrote for Massachusetts, well, was adopted by the White House.
[00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:42.126]  That's confirmed.
[00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:54.954]  We've got to get the word out that Romney openly supports carbon taxes and paying the Rothschilds, Rockefellers and Al Gore money to drive a car or to have electricity.
[00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:57.276]  A indulgence tax to them.
[00:12:58.191 --> 00:13:05.215]  We've got to get the word out about Rick Perry on forced inoculations and the fact that he knew it was killing people and still went ahead with it.
[00:13:05.255 --> 00:13:08.536]  We've got to get out the fact that he went to Bilderberg and was anointed.
[00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:16.000]  We've got to get the fact out that he tried to hand over 8,000 miles of Texas roads to Centra of Spain and that it violated the law.
[00:13:16.741 --> 00:13:22.104]  We've got to get the word out that he gave illegals in-state tuition and got awards from the Mexican government.
[00:13:22.944 --> 00:13:25.006]  This guy is a monster.
[00:13:26.066 --> 00:13:48.343]  And even if you support some of those things, maybe you're a socialist or hate this country and think it's fun that we're being bankrupted and somehow buy into the fact that open borders is good and handing our roads over to foreign corporations to rape us and rob us is good, you need to understand Rick Perry is a person who will do and say whatever he's paid to do and say.
[00:13:50.217 --> 00:13:51.138]  And that's the issue.
[00:13:51.578 --> 00:13:55.862]  Now, I'm going to open the phones up, because I've been striving to get to more of your calls.
[00:13:56.463 --> 00:14:01.168]  And while the phone calls stack up, I'm going to cover some of the news.
[00:14:01.228 --> 00:14:06.573]  But any issue you want to discuss, Libya, the economy, Rick Perry being the leader.
[00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:08.775]  I told you he was going to run.
[00:14:08.795 --> 00:14:10.897]  I told you he was going to pledge not to run.
[00:14:10.917 --> 00:14:12.879]  I told you he'd immediately be the frontrunner.
[00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:14.520]  I mean, that's...
[00:14:15.925 --> 00:14:17.226]  Not just our inside information.
[00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:21.667]  It was obvious when Limbaugh and Dorsteinman said, I'm drafting you, our reluctant hero.
[00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:26.009]  The whole thing is horrific.
[00:14:26.349 --> 00:14:37.054]  And I have to put up with the emails and comments and calls by Rick Perry supporters saying that I'm an Obama supporter and that I'm going after Rick Perry because I'm a communist.
[00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:40.775]  There's really no end to these people's wanton ignorance.
[00:14:41.196 --> 00:14:43.677]  A lot of them are political operatives, but
[00:14:45.589 --> 00:15:00.951]  I have learned some more things about Rick Perry that just add a little more weight to all the wild stories about him, but then I don't even know if I should
[00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:12.163]  Dignify any of it because that's not the type of issues I get into, but at the same time it just shows how the guy is the opposite of what you're told he is and what he presents.
[00:15:12.624 --> 00:15:17.448]  And that's why the establishment likes Rick Perry because they can blackmail him.
[00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:22.052]  Even if all the sex stories aren't true, they can blackmail him with his record.
[00:15:23.809 --> 00:15:30.694]  And anytime they want, they can bring him down with his MFR comments that have been recorded.
[00:15:30.714 --> 00:15:32.655]  That's not presidential.
[00:15:32.675 --> 00:15:37.899]  It could be running ads with his being stopped by the police and saying, get out of here.
[00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:38.740]  I'll do what I want.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.460]  I'm the governor.
[00:15:40.081 --> 00:15:41.462]  That's not very presidential.
[00:15:43.507 --> 00:15:47.710]  With his forced inoculations, that's not presidential or American.
[00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:57.697]  With his toll road activity and eminent domain, they were going to try to take hundreds of thousands, conservatively, of people's property and not pay them even what it was worth.
[00:15:57.717 --> 00:16:00.018]  I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:16:00.318 --> 00:16:11.706]  And so the biggest obstacle to Ron Paul winning is the dinosaur corporate whore media ignoring him, but when they're forced to cover him, lying about him or saying he can't win,
[00:16:12.386 --> 00:16:12.706]  I don't know.
[00:16:32.945 --> 00:16:33.746]  This is what I do.
[00:16:34.546 --> 00:16:35.687]  I study this information.
[00:16:35.987 --> 00:16:37.468]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:16:37.488 --> 00:16:37.528]  800-259-9231.
[00:16:37.548 --> 00:16:42.490]  Well, the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard and Haas, their president, this is a group sworn to get rid of the U.S.
[00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:42.950]  sovereignty.
[00:16:53.856 --> 00:16:54.296]  I think so.
[00:17:13.817 --> 00:17:19.622]  U.S., British, and other NATO special forces were in the country giving them weapons and advising them.
[00:17:20.142 --> 00:17:23.124]  And it wasn't a demonstration or a peaceful uprising.
[00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:29.649]  It was a paramilitary junta against the government of Libya.
[00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:32.832]  Whether you like Qaddafi or not, facts are facts.
[00:17:32.852 --> 00:17:34.113]  We were lied to again.
[00:17:34.673 --> 00:17:36.074]  We told you you were lied to.
[00:17:36.895 --> 00:17:38.036]  And now it's been confirmed.
[00:17:39.372 --> 00:17:39.713]  S.A.S.
[00:17:39.733 --> 00:17:50.073]  troops dressed in Arab clothes join hunt for Gaddafi as the one million pound or close to two million dollar reward is offered for dictator's head.
[00:17:51.345 --> 00:17:59.474]  And there's a photo in this article, if you guys zoom in on my article, where there's a guy that looks like Osama Bin Laden, who we're told is one of the great heroes.
[00:18:00.214 --> 00:18:02.737]  He kind of looks like an Osama Bin Laden double.
[00:18:03.478 --> 00:18:06.841]  There's one of the good guys that they've brought into the country.
[00:18:07.462 --> 00:18:10.565]  One of the Wahhabis to go after him.
[00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:15.823]  So just amazing.
[00:18:16.263 --> 00:18:18.125]  Continuing regime change in Libya.
[00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:20.067]  Good for business, picking up the spoils of war.
[00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:21.288]  Excellent article.
[00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:22.369]  Another one.
[00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:24.510]  Rebels claim to have Qaddafi surrounded.
[00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:25.831]  Financial Times of London.
[00:18:26.172 --> 00:18:31.516]  They claim he's in apartment buildings where secret tunnels feed out around his main compound.
[00:18:31.856 --> 00:18:32.797]  Who knows if that's true?
[00:18:32.837 --> 00:18:34.138]  We'll probably find out soon.
[00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:35.579]  They could also kill him.
[00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:51.598]  Throw his body down a mineshaft or put it in a vat of acid, and then claim for decades that Qaddafi's creeping around staging terror attacks, and then, you know, in 2020, claim the Navy SEALs killed him, and then if the Navy SEALs talk, they'll just blow their helicopter up.
[00:18:52.139 --> 00:18:52.639]  But, um...
[00:18:53.786 --> 00:18:55.467]  By the way, that is what the Navy SEALs think.
[00:18:56.007 --> 00:19:04.250]  I've actually talked directly to the father of a Navy SEAL, a person I've known, well, I'm not going to even say how long, because that could give it away.
[00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.071]  And then I've talked to others that know Navy SEALs, and that's the word.
[00:19:07.471 --> 00:19:08.832]  So they're living in reality.
[00:19:08.872 --> 00:19:09.312]  That's good.
[00:19:09.972 --> 00:19:12.273]  Libya's deadliest weapons not yet corralled.
[00:19:12.313 --> 00:19:14.474]  Again, they're saying he's got all these secret weapons.
[00:19:14.534 --> 00:19:16.055]  He might elude them for years.
[00:19:16.435 --> 00:19:17.796]  The fight will go on for years.
[00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:20.077]  You have a civil war, and then they'll claim that
[00:19:21.377 --> 00:19:27.443]  Qaddafi, they could claim that Qaddafi is still alive and that way they're not just fighting Libyans that don't want to be slaves.
[00:19:27.503 --> 00:19:28.644]  No, no, they're fighting Qaddafi.
[00:19:29.324 --> 00:19:30.806]  That's only a possibility.
[00:19:30.826 --> 00:19:33.528]  I'm not saying they're going to go with that, but I'll guarantee you that's being weighed.
[00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:34.829]  They could kill him.
[00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.910]  They could kill him.
[00:19:39.267 --> 00:19:41.648]  And again, say he's still alive like the boogeyman.
[00:19:42.308 --> 00:19:42.868]  Here's another one.
[00:19:42.928 --> 00:19:50.030]  Media openly admits foreign special forces behind overthrow of Qaddafi and that they've been there for six months.
[00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.290]  That's two months before the U.S.
[00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.071]  openly started getting involved.
[00:19:54.671 --> 00:19:55.431]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.211]  Stay with us.
[00:19:56.231 --> 00:19:57.351]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[00:19:57.711 --> 00:19:58.592]  Financial news.

[00:19:59.912 --> 00:20:00.392]  And a lot more.
[00:20:00.552 --> 00:20:05.555]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:21:30.716 --> 00:21:35.099]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:40.983]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.083 --> 00:21:44.485]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[00:22:05.561 --> 00:22:11.426]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[00:22:12.007 --> 00:22:13.768]  Number one, study the past.
[00:22:14.269 --> 00:22:16.030]  History really does repeat itself.
[00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:20.414]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[00:22:21.522 --> 00:22:23.784]  Number three, take decisive action.
[00:22:24.605 --> 00:22:27.867]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[00:22:28.448 --> 00:22:33.172]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[00:22:33.492 --> 00:22:36.955]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[00:22:37.495 --> 00:22:40.358]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[00:22:40.918 --> 00:22:44.541]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:45.402 --> 00:22:49.649]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.120]  That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[00:22:59.144 --> 00:23:00.085]  What happened, man?
[00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:04.268]  You used to be energetic, happy, and wow, did the ladies love you.
[00:23:04.588 --> 00:23:07.811]  Now, you fall asleep on the couch, irritable, and out of shape.
[00:23:08.131 --> 00:23:09.152]  Don't be that guy!

[00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:43.468]  Be the guy you used to be.
[00:23:43.868 --> 00:23:44.348]  Just call 1-800-847-6170.
[00:23:44.368 --> 00:23:45.248]  Don't wait another day.
[00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.111]  Just call 1-800-847-6170.
[00:23:51.151 --> 00:23:51.391]  Again, 1-800-847-6170.
[00:24:18.024 --> 00:24:33.556]  I've got a special report coming up where I really focus in and codify the facts that the first responders are being denied access to any of the events on September 11th's 10th anniversary.
[00:24:33.876 --> 00:24:37.079]  They're talking about having maybe a fire chief and a police chief, but that's it.
[00:24:37.699 --> 00:24:47.046]  Because the firemen and police officers and others cannot be trusted there at the event to not say something about the deadly dust or 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:24:47.166 --> 00:24:57.873]  They are now basically Al Qaeda and have to go through a terror database, Patriot Act database, to get access to health care after a nine and a half year fight to get them the health care.
[00:24:58.274 --> 00:25:01.296]  The government would just say, nope, no insurance, no payment for you.
[00:25:01.736 --> 00:25:02.837]  Just go home and die.
[00:25:03.437 --> 00:25:05.159]  After all, the dust is nutritious.
[00:25:06.019 --> 00:25:09.540]  Also, I'll get into Steve Jobs quits as Apple CEO.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:16.022]  I've got a message that I want to relay in written form and here on the radio slash TV show to them.
[00:25:16.882 --> 00:25:21.523]  All right, let's go to Angel, Curtis, Verna, Barney, Scott, and many others.
[00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.544]  Angel in Tennessee, welcome.
[00:25:24.944 --> 00:25:25.544]  Hi, thank you.
[00:25:26.244 --> 00:25:27.425]  I just have a quick question.
[00:25:27.525 --> 00:25:28.665]  I just saw a clip from
[00:25:29.249 --> 00:25:34.891]  The O'Reilly factor, maybe it was last night, saying that Fox News invited Ron Paul on and he declined.
[00:25:34.971 --> 00:25:36.612]  I was just wondering if you heard anything about that.
[00:25:37.732 --> 00:25:39.653]  Well, that's just obviously ridiculous.
[00:25:40.273 --> 00:25:46.456]  Ron Paul is on Fox News two or three times a week, generally on Fox Business where they'll have him.
[00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:50.897]  Ron Paul does most of the interviews he can.
[00:25:53.143 --> 00:26:03.674]  Fox has been caught doing things like playing tapes from a year before with people booing Ron Paul when he won the CPAC poll this year.
[00:26:04.154 --> 00:26:15.986]  He won it the year before, and a small group of Republicans that were for another candidate admittedly were given the microphone to boo two years ago into it.
[00:26:16.627 --> 00:26:25.295]  So that was a hoax too, and it came out that they'd been given the microphone whenever he was announced so they could boo, a small group, because there were so many people cheering.
[00:26:26.056 --> 00:26:32.902]  But still the cheers were louder than the boos, but Fox basically cranked it up to sound like he was being booed.
[00:26:33.162 --> 00:26:40.288]  Well this year when he won, and they had to quote apologize and said it was a mistake, they aired the tape from the year before.
[00:26:41.529 --> 00:26:43.611]  Uh, and said, oh, look, he got booed.
[00:26:44.131 --> 00:26:48.634]  And so I would imagine, I haven't seen this, so I don't want to accuse him, but you're saying you saw this.
[00:26:48.954 --> 00:26:50.855]  They probably called and said, can he do it right now?
[00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:52.557]  Or can he do it in two hours?
[00:26:52.637 --> 00:27:00.182]  And if he already had, uh, I know for a fact Ron Paul before has turned down TV interviews because he's scheduled on this show.
[00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:04.523]  And I've, you know, had him pop on and say, all right, I got to vote in 10 minutes.
[00:27:04.543 --> 00:27:05.924]  Sorry, can't give you 30, Alex.
[00:27:06.864 --> 00:27:09.565]  Or I got to go in 15 because I've got to squeeze another interview in.
[00:27:09.905 --> 00:27:15.087]  So I'll guarantee you that if they did say that, it's probably not true.
[00:27:16.807 --> 00:27:21.408]  So now I know he doesn't really trust the O'Reilly factor and he's called Glenn Beck a demagogue.
[00:27:21.728 --> 00:27:27.150]  So I know that he may have had the stipulation that, hey, it's got to be live.
[00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:29.751]  But again, I don't want to speculate for Ron Paul.
[00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:31.411]  What did Lord O'Reilly say?
[00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:38.093]  It was well, he was saying it was actually a response to when Ron Paul was on with Megyn Kelly.
[00:27:39.125 --> 00:27:49.269]  And they were talking about him being ignored by the media and so on and so he was saying well there you know he was whining because he was being ignored so we invited him on and he ignored us.
[00:27:49.289 --> 00:27:56.012]  Yeah well I'll say this about sure I'll say this about Bill O'Reilly he had a lot better show until the
[00:27:58.024 --> 00:28:13.324]  Reports that he reportedly settled on of his sexual bullying and pervert talk came out and we got a totally new O'Reilly after that but he kept his job and suddenly O'Reilly supports VAT taxes.
[00:28:14.145 --> 00:28:15.846]  And I've seen him support carbon taxes.
[00:28:16.907 --> 00:28:25.253]  So, I mean, this is our great independent Fox News leader telling us how great value-added taxes are, you know, to get us out of debt.
[00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:27.414]  Bill O'Reilly's a really smart guy.
[00:28:27.734 --> 00:28:36.320]  Bill O'Reilly knows that we could have 100% taxes and it wouldn't pay off these derivatives that we've been fraudulently signed on to.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.462]  How do I know Bill O'Reilly's really smart?
[00:28:39.298 --> 00:28:49.543]  Well, when he worked at some of the weeknight news shows, and of course some of those famous clips have been leaked where he says, bleep it, I'll do it live.
[00:28:50.083 --> 00:28:54.285]  I've talked to reporters that worked with him and shot packages.
[00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:57.427]  I talked to a guy that was one of his producers.
[00:28:58.027 --> 00:28:59.848]  And he laughed and said, oh yeah, that's Bill.
[00:29:00.148 --> 00:29:02.710]  Bill was a big conspiracy theorist like you.
[00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:09.634]  And then I went and found the news clips of him saying JFK was murdered by the government, E. Howard Hunt did it, here's the proof.
[00:29:09.914 --> 00:29:16.037]  And he was a totally different O'Reilly, really seeming friendlier and nicer and really excited to be reporting it.
[00:29:16.318 --> 00:29:24.983]  Bill O'Reilly, when I first saw him on Fox, I don't know, it had to be 10, 12, 13 years ago, he would talk about the Illuminati and have Tony Brown on.
[00:29:25.823 --> 00:29:31.667]  Okay, so he... Bill O'Reilly is a smart guy, okay?
[00:29:31.927 --> 00:29:34.468]  He knew this stuff when I was in high school.
[00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:38.351]  There are newscasts of him when I was in high school.
[00:29:39.651 --> 00:29:43.073]  And reportedly, he could never get really bigger jobs because he knew the truth.
[00:29:43.454 --> 00:29:45.034]  Bill O'Reilly is a sellout.
[00:29:45.335 --> 00:29:46.435]  He is disgusting.
[00:29:46.796 --> 00:29:47.496]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.536 --> 00:29:47.936]  Thank you.
[00:29:50.798 --> 00:29:51.698]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.199 --> 00:29:53.700]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.688 --> 00:29:57.490]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.652 --> 00:30:05.274]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.674 --> 00:30:08.676]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:08.916 --> 00:30:13.719]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:14.079 --> 00:30:19.922]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.102 --> 00:30:22.344]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:22.884 --> 00:30:23.164]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.184 --> 00:30:23.604]  Bernanke?
[00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:24.465]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.485 --> 00:30:25.746]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.766 --> 00:30:27.887]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.775 --> 00:30:48.700]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:58.167]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:01.328 --> 00:31:02.810]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:08.076]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:08.356 --> 00:31:09.698]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:09.878 --> 00:31:18.668]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:19.409 --> 00:31:26.493]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:34.557]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:34.938 --> 00:31:39.860]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.342]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:04.098]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:04.418 --> 00:32:05.039]  Number one.
[00:32:05.339 --> 00:32:08.481]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:08.762 --> 00:32:09.342]  Number two.
[00:32:09.622 --> 00:32:14.166]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:14.506 --> 00:32:14.946]  It's true.
[00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:19.830]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:20.670]  Number three.
[00:32:20.951 --> 00:32:24.233]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:28.236]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:28.436 --> 00:32:28.977]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.237 --> 00:32:31.599]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:31.999 --> 00:32:35.383]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:35.683 --> 00:32:36.223]  Number 5.
[00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:40.387]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:40.627 --> 00:32:45.372]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:45.652 --> 00:32:49.693]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:49.833 --> 00:32:51.394]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:32:51.614 --> 00:32:53.694]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:32:53.874 --> 00:32:56.215]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:33:21.235 --> 00:33:21.896]  That's right.
[00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:24.840]  We got to eject from the prison planet.
[00:33:25.621 --> 00:33:36.353]  Alright, I don't want to get off in bashing Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity or any of these people, but when folks ask me about them, I will
[00:33:37.813 --> 00:33:38.853]  I'll tell you what I really think.
[00:33:38.873 --> 00:33:39.994]  I mean, I'll be honest with you.
[00:33:40.754 --> 00:33:54.957]  To see all these old news reports of 15, 20 years ago with Bill O'Reilly on news shows doing whole news packages about the Illuminati and the New World Order and secret government operations.
[00:33:55.077 --> 00:33:56.898]  Oh, Iran-Contra drug dealing.
[00:33:58.378 --> 00:33:59.678]  JFK being murdered.
[00:34:00.439 --> 00:34:01.279]  And by who?
[00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:05.300]  You actually watch those newscasts 20 years later, they're all very accurate.
[00:34:05.921 --> 00:34:14.225]  And reportedly, and the proof's there, O'Reilly was chomping at the bit, always fighting to get these type of stories on the air.
[00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:15.625]  And now look at him.
[00:34:16.246 --> 00:34:19.827]  Oh, these conspiracy theorists think there's a move for a world government.
[00:34:20.548 --> 00:34:23.689]  Oh, these 9-11 truthers are dangerous.
[00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:31.013]  And you're looking at somebody who you know is awake and is consciously up there doing this.
[00:34:32.148 --> 00:34:43.877]  And I guess what happens is these guys get older, they want success, or somebody who they know that they're more talented than has gotten the promotion, and they just say, that's it, I'm joining the dark side.
[00:34:45.718 --> 00:34:46.779]  And I understand that.
[00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:52.103]  I don't care about money, fame, fortune, things like that.
[00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:55.086]  But I am competitive.
[00:34:56.375 --> 00:35:16.621]  And to see lesser men, people like that, sit up there and attain incredible success and notoriety by compromising, that's one of the few areas that makes you just think, just for a moment, wow, I could sell out and absolutely dominate all these people.
[00:35:17.402 --> 00:35:21.343]  But why gain the whole world and lose your soul?
[00:35:23.029 --> 00:35:25.049]  That's really going to be my message to Steve Jobs.
[00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:27.530]  It's not too late to turn back, buddy boy.
[00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:28.630]  I know all about you.
[00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:30.430]  All about your co-founder.
[00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.530]  Bunch of transhumanists.
[00:35:32.331 --> 00:35:36.891]  I know all about the big suicide operations there in China.
[00:35:36.951 --> 00:35:38.052]  Your horrible factories.
[00:35:38.732 --> 00:35:41.212]  I know all about your carbon tax ideas.
[00:35:41.252 --> 00:35:42.532]  I know all about IBM.
[00:35:42.552 --> 00:35:44.193]  I know all about Bill Gates.
[00:35:44.233 --> 00:35:45.773]  I know all about you boys.
[00:35:46.993 --> 00:35:51.954]  And yeah, most people don't live more than a year with the type of pancreatic cancer you had.
[00:35:53.044 --> 00:35:54.605]  You have lived, what, seven years?
[00:35:55.345 --> 00:35:55.846]  Or longer?
[00:35:57.307 --> 00:36:06.592]  And they've sure kept you alive, but, uh... By the way, they say they found the Bill O'Reilly.
[00:36:06.632 --> 00:36:10.594]  I told them go to YouTube and type in Bill O'Reilly on JFK.
[00:36:10.614 --> 00:36:14.917]  Uh, and I... We hadn't found it by the time I went live again.
[00:36:14.937 --> 00:36:16.858]  Uh, is it old?
[00:36:16.878 --> 00:36:20.460]  Uh, what newscast is it?
[00:36:22.892 --> 00:36:24.212]  Because he worked a bunch of different places.
[00:36:24.292 --> 00:36:25.052]  Is it hard copy?
[00:36:25.172 --> 00:36:25.493]  Extra?
[00:36:27.833 --> 00:36:31.414]  Is it a local news station?
[00:36:31.434 --> 00:36:32.294]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:36:38.035 --> 00:36:41.816]  Well, I'll tell you what, I'll just wait till later.
[00:36:42.316 --> 00:36:43.596]  I'll come in and look and see what it is.
[00:36:43.616 --> 00:36:46.297]  Because the one I'm talking about, you can tell which one it is.
[00:36:47.857 --> 00:36:50.278]  I don't want to just sit here and say that Bill O'Reilly
[00:36:52.372 --> 00:37:00.238]  ...did all these countless newscasts about government assassinations, government drug dealing, JFK being murdered by the government, and then not prove it to you.
[00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:02.820]  Well, let's just blind play it.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.881]  I don't know what they're about to play, what they found, but here it is.
[00:37:07.703 --> 00:37:10.445]  ...who have covered their tracks for almost 28 years.
[00:37:10.825 --> 00:37:16.129]  But the most comprehensive study of the assassination found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.
[00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:21.313]  And as Jeff Cole tells us in this special report, the government stands by that study.
[00:37:27.674 --> 00:37:29.335]  They're making a movie in Dallas.
[00:37:30.756 --> 00:37:34.198]  A movie about the crime of the century.
[00:37:34.738 --> 00:37:36.319]  Some say it's never been solved.
[00:37:36.699 --> 00:37:39.021]  Others claim they know the truth.
[00:37:39.081 --> 00:37:43.143]  The course of American history was forever changed in a matter of seconds.
[00:37:43.744 --> 00:37:47.586]  But what happened is still being questioned some 28 years later.
[00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:50.628]  Who really shot President John F. Kennedy?
[00:37:55.166 --> 00:38:00.691]  Since the assassination, conspiracy theories have captured the attention of the American public.
[00:38:00.771 --> 00:38:02.493]  Could it have been a mafia hit?
[00:38:03.053 --> 00:38:04.955]  Was it ordered by Fidel Castro?
[00:38:05.495 --> 00:38:09.279]  Or was it a coup from a subversive element of our own government?
[00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:14.183]  It was the responsibility of the specially appointed Warren Commission to find out.
[00:38:15.133 --> 00:38:22.141]  In a 26-volume report, they concluded only one gunman, 24-year-old Lee Harvey Oswald, assassinated the president.
[00:38:22.582 --> 00:38:26.767]  But critics over the years have branded that report as a blue-ribbon cover-up.
[00:38:27.087 --> 00:38:30.571]  I think the people that alleged that this has been a major cover-up
[00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:33.743]  Basically, are intellectually dishonest.
[00:38:34.064 --> 00:38:36.947]  Attorney David Bellin was counsel to the Warren Commission.
[00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:42.211]  It was his investigation that led to many of the findings that are still under fire today.
[00:38:42.552 --> 00:38:48.818]  There is not one claim that any one of them makes that I cannot answer completely if given the opportunity.
[00:38:53.231 --> 00:38:54.771]  No, I've not been charged with that.
[00:38:54.831 --> 00:38:56.772]  In fact, nobody has said that to me yet.
[00:38:57.312 --> 00:39:02.734]  There have been claims that B. Harvey Oswald was a patsy, set up by others to take the blame.
[00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:11.537]  But one little-known discovery uncovered by the Warren Commission suggests that this was not the first time Oswald tried to commit a political assassination.
[00:39:12.518 --> 00:39:16.139]  Okay, that's one I've never seen and looks even earlier.
[00:39:16.179 --> 00:39:18.400]  He looks like he's 28 years old.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:27.182]  I've got some others from the early 90s where he comes right out and basically shows who killed Kennedy and talks about E. Howard Hunt and things.
[00:39:27.542 --> 00:39:29.823]  But that's just what the guys found in a quick search.
[00:39:30.543 --> 00:39:31.563]  There's so many of these.
[00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:34.224]  You can look up Bill O'Reilly on CIA drug trafficking.
[00:39:34.744 --> 00:39:36.285]  And they're hard-hitting reports.
[00:39:36.545 --> 00:39:37.405]  Now I've digressed.
[00:39:37.986 --> 00:39:40.287]  I love taking calls, but that's what always happens when I take them.
[00:39:40.327 --> 00:39:41.367]  I'll run down rabbit trails.
[00:39:41.407 --> 00:39:43.908]  But that makes the show more interesting and more informative.
[00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:45.629]  Who would have known we'd go in that direction?
[00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:49.191]  Let's go to Curtis in Virginia.
[00:39:49.231 --> 00:39:50.151]  Curtis, you're on the air.
[00:39:50.491 --> 00:39:51.132]  Thanks for holding.
[00:39:51.152 --> 00:39:53.493]  Hey Alex, how are you today?
[00:39:53.573 --> 00:39:53.833]  Good.
[00:39:54.773 --> 00:39:55.213]  Alright.
[00:39:55.534 --> 00:40:00.176]  I'm interested in a couple things.
[00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:02.897]  One is direct
[00:40:04.546 --> 00:40:11.008]  Um, uh, protests and non violent action.
[00:40:12.029 --> 00:40:19.191]  Uh, but I would like to see, uh, your listeners as well as yourself, especially with you being such a strong example.
[00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:32.115]  Why don't we cut all our credit cards, destroy all credit cards that's in the global system, actually destroy them and focus more on
[00:40:33.021 --> 00:40:34.762]  Credit unions and so forth and so forth.
[00:40:35.182 --> 00:40:36.383]  I think that's a great idea.
[00:40:36.403 --> 00:40:42.686]  You know, I myself end up using big banks with our business system because it makes it easier to operate and get things done.
[00:40:42.726 --> 00:40:47.628]  And it's approaching the point that I use smaller banks privately.
[00:40:48.128 --> 00:40:51.850]  It's approaching the point where I won't even be able to use small banks if this continues.
[00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:56.032]  And so we're getting to that point where they're trying to force everybody into mega banks
[00:40:57.212 --> 00:41:04.238]  And they're trying to force everybody into a cashless system, and they're always demonizing cash and demonizing local banks.
[00:41:04.338 --> 00:41:12.204]  And the private Federal Reserve controls the federal regulators that are harassing credit unions, smaller local and regional banks.
[00:41:12.664 --> 00:41:21.891]  So absolutely, that is a big thing you can do, is get your money out of the big mega banks and get it into smaller banks.
[00:41:21.911 --> 00:41:23.272]  And that's something we need to do here.
[00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:33.894]  I mean, I've done that to a great extent, but still, uh, I've got, we've got some funds here in a big Texas bank that's really connected to some big ones.
[00:41:33.914 --> 00:41:34.434]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:41:35.876 --> 00:41:39.919]  Well, no, I just, I just think that that can have an immediate impact.
[00:41:40.179 --> 00:41:42.901]  Uh, if you could imagine you, you have millions of listeners.
[00:41:43.302 --> 00:41:51.588]  If only 10% of your listeners destroyed all their credit cards, they would see a drastic impact within a 24, 40 hour timeframe.
[00:41:51.628 --> 00:41:52.669]  You know, um,
[00:41:55.931 --> 00:41:58.072]  I just think it's time for us to start attacking.
[00:41:58.112 --> 00:41:59.353]  Right now we're on the defense.
[00:42:00.213 --> 00:42:08.397]  If we attack by cutting the money line to the Giants that we're feeding, they're going to have to react.
[00:42:08.417 --> 00:42:10.138]  They're going to have to change their game plan.
[00:42:10.418 --> 00:42:12.820]  We got to get off of the defense and get on the offense.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:19.043]  And that's one strategic way that each individual can have some type of input.
[00:42:19.483 --> 00:42:21.364]  I've already destroyed all my credit cards.
[00:42:22.104 --> 00:42:23.705]  If I do anything, it's debit.
[00:42:24.565 --> 00:42:29.086]  And money that I already have in the bank that I'm spending.
[00:42:29.126 --> 00:42:36.147]  Well, that is a good point, that credit cards are bad to begin with, unless you have one for an emergency.
[00:42:37.227 --> 00:42:38.688]  It's good to live within your means.
[00:42:39.288 --> 00:42:51.710]  Look, when I was going to college, I got credit cards in the mail, sometimes three, four times a week, but always at least one a week, offering me a new credit card, but with outrageous interest.
[00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:58.987]  Now, as soon as I became solvent, I don't get all these credit cards in the mail anymore.
[00:42:59.367 --> 00:43:03.851]  But I've talked to college students and people that are broke and others, they get them all the time.
[00:43:04.192 --> 00:43:06.514]  Because it's all made up fiat currency.
[00:43:06.854 --> 00:43:10.417]  To explain what fractional reserve banking is, a Bank of America, a Wells Fargo...
[00:43:11.616 --> 00:43:16.577]  You know, both of those Warren Buffett outfits, he's a large part of each one of them.
[00:43:17.118 --> 00:43:22.559]  When you have one of those credit cards, they are loaning you money that doesn't even exist.
[00:43:22.579 --> 00:43:23.399]  They're getting interest.
[00:43:24.059 --> 00:43:27.060]  They get $1 of a depositor's money, they can loan out $10.
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:34.742]  But since the end of Glass-Steagall, they can loan out a trillion dollars out of nothing, if they can get away with the fraud.
[00:43:35.282 --> 00:43:37.583]  That's what's happening with the too-big-to-fail derivatives.
[00:43:38.023 --> 00:43:40.264]  They've been caught, and instead of going to jail,
[00:43:41.391 --> 00:43:44.012]  Our credit and faith and our tax money is pledged to them.
[00:43:44.613 --> 00:43:49.855]  Then they have Bill O'Reilly come out and say, oh, I think we may need to get some more taxes.
[00:43:50.175 --> 00:43:55.358]  Mitt Romney came out yesterday and said he's not adverse to new revenue streams, meaning new taxes.
[00:43:56.499 --> 00:44:02.561]  They doubled the size of Texas government, got a bunch of new taxes passed when Rick Perry was governor for 10 years.
[00:44:02.622 --> 00:44:04.963]  And I've got to hear idiots outside Texas
[00:44:05.723 --> 00:44:14.811]  When I've covered Texas policy closely, down at the Capitol all the time when it's in session, and they lecture me about Rick Perry made Texas great?
[00:44:15.691 --> 00:44:15.992]  What?
[00:44:16.072 --> 00:44:18.514]  I mean, these people are really collectivists.
[00:44:18.554 --> 00:44:24.519]  They're like these idiot Obama supporters that think he was going to give them free gas and a car and a house.
[00:44:24.799 --> 00:44:32.225]  Remember all those people going, oh, thank you, Mr. President, right when he got elected, before he was actually in office, when he was president-elect, saying, all my problems are solved?
[00:44:32.265 --> 00:44:34.327]  And Obama didn't say, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:44:34.827 --> 00:44:36.528]  I'm not going to be able to wave a magic wand.
[00:44:36.588 --> 00:44:37.308]  They believe it.
[00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:43.710]  They believe Rick Perry is going to go into office and magically fix everything for them, my friend.
[00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:44.330]  What do you think of that?
[00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:45.390]  Right.
[00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:47.591]  It's all BS.
[00:44:47.831 --> 00:44:48.291]  It really is.
[00:44:48.551 --> 00:44:50.892]  One last point, Alex, because I know you got all the callers.
[00:44:52.393 --> 00:44:56.214]  The same giant that we're complaining about every day on your show,
[00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.013]  It's the same giant we're feeding every time we use a credit card.
[00:45:00.373 --> 00:45:00.974]  I agree with you.
[00:45:00.994 --> 00:45:02.836]  I absolutely agree.
[00:45:02.936 --> 00:45:06.439]  We gotta stop feeding the giant if we're ever gonna fight back.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:12.985]  As long as they have power and money, our money, and keep putting us in debt, they're winning.
[00:45:13.566 --> 00:45:15.708]  So we can complain until we're blue in the face.
[00:45:16.208 --> 00:45:17.830]  We gotta cut off the money supply.
[00:45:18.547 --> 00:45:20.168]  Curtis, well said.
[00:45:20.789 --> 00:45:22.210]  We've got to come out of Babylon.
[00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:24.492]  And that doesn't mean you have to do it 100%.
[00:45:24.552 --> 00:45:25.352]  Nobody can do that.
[00:45:25.973 --> 00:45:29.535]  Unless you're independently wealthy and just want to go hide out in Montana.
[00:45:30.396 --> 00:45:32.558]  We've got to do what we can do.
[00:45:33.519 --> 00:45:35.360]  We've got to do as much as we can do.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.803]  Or if we do something hypocritical, point out we're doing it.
[00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:45.568]  You know, when I criticized Steve Jobs later, I'm going to stay on record, I'm a hypocrite.
[00:45:47.146 --> 00:45:49.290]  I have used Apple products for 20 years.
[00:45:51.255 --> 00:45:55.497]  I mean, it's all made in slave facilities.
[00:45:55.917 --> 00:45:59.378]  It's all assembled in slave-style facilities.
[00:45:59.398 --> 00:46:03.240]  There's some smaller companies that aren't, based in the U.S., Canada, and other areas.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:10.762]  But at the end of the day, when we buy goods made by slaves, we move ourselves a degree closer to those slaves.
[00:46:11.182 --> 00:46:13.263]  It's the giant sucking sound.
[00:46:13.924 --> 00:46:19.926]  It's the problems that Ross Perot talked about and got laughed at by Al Gore.
[00:46:20.822 --> 00:46:23.389]  A guy that sold the public that carbon dioxide is going to kill him.
[00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:28.262]  You know, we're going to send reporters out today.
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:34.541]  For the special report tonight in Austin to ask folks if carbon dioxide is evil.
[00:46:35.301 --> 00:46:39.463]  And we'll see how many Austinites get scared when they even hear the word.
[00:46:40.123 --> 00:46:41.783]  Because I've seen other newscasters do it.
[00:46:41.903 --> 00:46:42.763]  I've done it before.
[00:46:43.184 --> 00:46:45.504]  You can come up and say, should we ban dihydrogen monoxide?
[00:46:46.264 --> 00:46:47.265]  It's in a lot of things.
[00:46:48.425 --> 00:46:49.065]  Should we ban it?
[00:46:49.165 --> 00:46:52.186]  And over 90% of the people, when I've done it, say ban it right now.
[00:46:52.206 --> 00:46:55.387]  Of course, dihydrogen monoxide is water, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:56.127 --> 00:46:59.168]  Nine out of ten people or more will say ban sodium chloride.
[00:47:01.032 --> 00:47:01.773]  It's table salt.
[00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:04.835]  It's table salt.
[00:47:05.916 --> 00:47:09.238]  So they just prey on people's ignorance, and I'm tired of it.
[00:47:10.459 --> 00:47:24.630]  When you've got a group of people totally ignorant, and you've got a bunch of criminals running them through a high-tech slick media, with political prostitutes that'll sit up there and say whatever they're told off that teleprompter for 30 pieces of silver, your society goes over the edge.
[00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:28.133]  See, this is my message to mid-level corrupt people.
[00:47:28.453 --> 00:47:30.015]  The big social engineers know this.
[00:47:31.377 --> 00:47:35.379]  But my message to mid-level people who never really think about it, you're just getting the money and running.
[00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:40.943]  Corruption doesn't just sit at one spot.
[00:47:42.523 --> 00:47:45.285]  You don't just buy into a little bit of corruption and that's the end of it.
[00:47:46.306 --> 00:47:49.347]  There's always somebody willing to do something even more corrupt.
[00:47:50.068 --> 00:47:51.168]  More out of control.
[00:47:51.969 --> 00:47:53.070]  And it's a race to the bottom.
[00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:57.112]  I've seen sociological reports on pornography.
[00:47:59.893 --> 00:48:09.459]  And how it just gets more disgusting, more degenerate, more dehumanizing to the women, more circus oriented, because nothing shocks people anymore.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:15.683]  Until it's just the most horrible things you can imagine.
[00:48:16.303 --> 00:48:17.724]  Because we've been dehumanized.
[00:48:17.804 --> 00:48:18.785]  We've been programmed.
[00:48:19.465 --> 00:48:20.786]  And this has been done consciously.
[00:48:23.548 --> 00:48:26.770]  Consciously to make us more easy to control and more dumbed down.
[00:48:28.817 --> 00:48:30.778]  Let's go ahead and talk to Verna in Canada.
[00:48:30.798 --> 00:48:31.858]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[00:48:33.038 --> 00:48:33.738]  Oh, hi Alex.
[00:48:33.778 --> 00:48:35.219]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:41.241]  Listen, a while ago I had a chance meeting with a young Canadian soldier, right?
[00:48:42.101 --> 00:48:46.442]  And it turned to politics and I asked him and he heard of the New World Order.
[00:48:46.942 --> 00:48:48.163]  And he said, oh sure.
[00:48:48.663 --> 00:48:50.363]  And he said, do you know about the camps?
[00:48:51.004 --> 00:48:52.124]  And I said, what camps?
[00:48:52.904 --> 00:48:57.989]  And he said, well, the Canadian government built 12 of them in the north of Canada, right?
[00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:03.815]  He said there were three in the Yukon, six in the Northwest Territories, and three in Labrador.
[00:49:04.616 --> 00:49:07.318]  So I said, under whose watch did they build those?
[00:49:07.899 --> 00:49:09.941]  And he said, Pierre Trudeau.
[00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:14.666]  Well, any Canadian worth his salt knows that Trudeau was an ardent communist, right?
[00:49:15.279 --> 00:49:17.080]  And I said, are they still functioning?
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.081]  And he said, oh yeah.
[00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:19.862]  He said, I flew supplies into them.
[00:49:20.443 --> 00:49:23.025]  And he said, and I could go to jail for telling you this.
[00:49:23.085 --> 00:49:26.087]  He said, I had to sign a sworn statement on it.
[00:49:26.367 --> 00:49:27.168]  Well, of course they do.
[00:49:27.188 --> 00:49:30.150]  But let me add, we have the congressional hearings and it's the same program.
[00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:31.851]  In every industrialized nation.
[00:49:32.251 --> 00:49:35.213]  Just like for 39 years, all babies at birth have their blood taken.
[00:49:35.513 --> 00:49:38.575]  Whether it's Australia or the US, you're told the same cover story.
[00:49:38.995 --> 00:49:40.656]  Oh, the health department does a blood test.
[00:49:40.696 --> 00:49:42.597]  Notice we all have health departments.
[00:49:42.957 --> 00:49:47.740]  They were set up under eugenics 1910 through 1925 or so.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:50.382]  England, Germany, Canada, Mexico had them.
[00:49:50.842 --> 00:49:53.904]  Australia, New Zealand, Northern Europe.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.321]  It's all standardized.
[00:49:57.042 --> 00:50:01.846]  And now they just admit with the Emergency Centers Establishment Act what we already knew.
[00:50:01.926 --> 00:50:03.868]  It's the old military bases, they list them.
[00:50:04.188 --> 00:50:06.810]  It's just further funding and going public with it.
[00:50:07.411 --> 00:50:09.673]  Because these are for your own good during emergencies.
[00:50:09.993 --> 00:50:12.495]  Don't you want to go to a government camp, Verna?
[00:50:13.396 --> 00:50:14.877]  No, no, not a chance.
[00:50:15.017 --> 00:50:16.258]  You know what?
[00:50:16.478 --> 00:50:21.643]  My Newfoundland fisherman father taught me it's better to die on my feet than live on my knees.
[00:50:22.518 --> 00:50:25.240]  Absolutely, that's a true credo of any free human.
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:28.061]  Did he say anything else about the loving facilities?
[00:50:29.122 --> 00:50:34.385]  Yes, he said that each one accommodates 15,000 people, right?
[00:50:35.065 --> 00:50:43.730]  And you know, when I was a kid, my father was a Newfoundland fisherman, and when I was a kid, he used to fish in Labrador, and we'd go up there in the summertime.
[00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:45.931]  And let me tell you, Alex,
[00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:54.223]  When you cross the Straits of Belisle and you hit Labrador, about two miles past there, the earth drops off.
[00:50:54.743 --> 00:50:58.184]  It is the most desolate, God-forsaken place on earth.
[00:50:58.284 --> 00:50:59.765]  It's like a Soviet gulag.
[00:51:00.405 --> 00:51:01.265]  You've been lied to.
[00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:05.946]  Lied to by the Wall Street propaganda machine, the government, and the talking heads in the media.
[00:51:06.026 --> 00:51:09.588]  The market has proven that it's more like a casino than an investment.
[00:51:09.948 --> 00:51:14.489]  And if you've had enough and want to keep your hard-earned money safe, this message is for you.
[00:51:15.049 --> 00:51:20.977]  My name is Brett Kitchen, and after losing 35% of my money when the market crashed several years ago, I said enough.
[00:51:21.097 --> 00:51:30.409]  Since then, I discovered a way to safely grow your money, cut taxes dramatically, get potential double-digit gains, but also have my money protected when the crashes come.
[00:51:30.709 --> 00:51:36.933]  Get a free copy of my new book, Safe Money Millionaire, where I share this powerful tool that people like Walt Disney and J.C.
[00:51:36.973 --> 00:51:39.215]  Penney used to safely grow their wealth.
[00:51:39.615 --> 00:51:40.216]  Just call 1-800-675-1640.
[00:51:40.236 --> 00:51:40.776]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[00:51:40.796 --> 00:51:43.898]  On the web, go to safemoneybook.com or just call 1-800-675-1640.
[00:51:43.918 --> 00:51:44.338]  Again, that's 1-800-675-1640.
[00:52:00.089 --> 00:52:05.394]  Infowars.com for 16 years has led the charge against the technocrats.
[00:52:05.654 --> 00:52:13.621]  We have had unrivaled success in unlocking minds, expanding paradigms, and rallying the people to face the new world order.
[00:52:13.922 --> 00:52:21.869]  No one can deny that our media operation is the tip of the spear and it's because of our success that we have a responsibility to
[00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:25.630]  To intensify our operations against the globalist 110%.
[00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:30.751]  We're only a month away from launching a weeknight news broadcast.
[00:52:30.911 --> 00:52:33.212]  The social network is nearing completion as well.

[00:54:22.952 --> 00:54:24.914]  Mommy, where did Daddy go?
[00:54:24.974 --> 00:54:27.556]  Shh, honey, don't talk about it.
[00:54:28.177 --> 00:54:29.398]  He had to go bye-bye.
[00:54:29.418 --> 00:54:34.122]  He said bad things about the homeland and our leaders.
[00:54:35.403 --> 00:54:37.425]  But Mommy, Daddy was nice.
[00:54:38.486 --> 00:54:40.328]  Honey, Daddy's never coming back.
[00:54:42.009 --> 00:54:43.490]  But he was a good man.
[00:54:43.510 --> 00:54:46.053]  Don't let anybody hear you say that.
[00:54:46.633 --> 00:54:48.535]  They'll take you away from Mommy, too.
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:55.644]  Whatever you do, never talk bad about the dear leader and the banker guardians.
[00:54:56.625 --> 00:55:00.008]  Never talk bad about the head of Google, Lord Schmidt.
[00:55:01.128 --> 00:55:02.389]  Never talk about them.
[00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.552]  They protect us from the Al Qaeda scourge.
[00:55:09.014 --> 00:55:14.699]  Mommy, the neighbor told me that Ron Paul, Ron Paul would have stopped them.
[00:55:15.399 --> 00:55:16.940]  Don't ever say his name.
[00:55:17.641 --> 00:55:18.582]  He's just as evil.
[00:55:37.202 --> 00:55:37.942]  That was weird.
[00:55:37.962 --> 00:55:49.545]  I was doing a little bit about the FEMA camps and suddenly my microphone and everything went... I thought they were like playing thunderstorms in the distance and it's some technical difficulty.
[00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:53.426]  Guess I'm not allowed to... Who knows if the listeners are even hearing that.
[00:55:53.446 --> 00:55:55.387]  Maybe I'm not allowed to talk bad about Big Brother here.
[00:55:55.987 --> 00:55:57.748]  Maybe I've committed some type of thought crime.
[00:55:59.728 --> 00:56:00.468]  Do you guys hear that?
[00:56:03.209 --> 00:56:03.609]  Well, they don't.
[00:56:05.129 --> 00:56:06.730]  Yeah, you hear the rumble too, John?
[00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:10.410]  Oh, well, whatever.
[00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:13.071]  We got a rumble in the background of the show now.
[00:56:13.111 --> 00:56:15.791]  Let's go ahead and talk to Barney in Texas.
[00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:16.791]  Barney, good to hear from you.
[00:56:16.831 --> 00:56:17.151]  Welcome.
[00:56:18.432 --> 00:56:19.652]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:56:20.192 --> 00:56:32.674]  I wanted to bring up about the 9-11 memorial coming up, and it seemed really strange to me that they announced that Obama would be there, you know, like a month ago in the news on a Google article.
[00:56:32.694 --> 00:56:36.855]  Well, aren't you glad that the terrorists, firefighters, and police aren't allowed to be there?
[00:56:36.875 --> 00:56:38.395]  The first responders?
[00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.491]  Well, yeah, that's kind of sick, but it just felt kind of strange.
[00:56:41.571 --> 00:56:52.475]  Like that same feeling I had, you know, that gut-wrenching feeling you were talking about yesterday that I had on 9-11 and when and during Obama's, uh, his speech, his first speech when he got elected.
[00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:55.176]  That's the same feeling I got when I saw this article.
[00:56:55.597 --> 00:56:58.258]  So it seems like that would be a perfect time for them.
[00:56:58.278 --> 00:57:02.960]  You know, I just saw an article today that they said it would be about 300,000 people at this memorial.
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.401]  That'd be a perfect time for them to stage a false flag attack.
[00:57:07.021 --> 00:57:08.822]  The other thing I wanted to mention
[00:57:09.321 --> 00:57:12.424]  Was it now listening to you since 2009?
[00:57:13.045 --> 00:57:15.348]  You should let people know they can't enjoy movies anymore.
[00:57:15.508 --> 00:57:19.732]  That's what I used to do and enjoy just going to the movies and forgetting about everything.
[00:57:19.772 --> 00:57:27.781]  But now, like I went and saw that about six months ago, I saw that movie Limitless about where the guy takes the pill and can do anything.
[00:57:27.841 --> 00:57:29.062]  It opens up his mind or whatever.
[00:57:29.143 --> 00:57:31.205]  And before the whole Libya
[00:57:32.188 --> 00:57:32.769]  I don't think so.
[00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:48.800]  Oh, well, insiders love to also brag to each other, but also precondition the subconscious mind, because if your mind's already seen it, you then expect it.
[00:57:49.461 --> 00:57:59.648]  Most of the big modern warfare video games that come out will, a year or two before, have the exact conflict and the real battles in it precisely in order.
[00:58:00.228 --> 00:58:01.549]  And they do that in all the movies.
[00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:04.271]  And there's hundreds of examples, but six months before 9-11,
[00:58:05.572 --> 00:58:16.659]  They aired the lone gunman spinoff of The X-Files, where the government hijacks a jumbo jet to fly it in the World Trade Center using remote control technology and uses a drill to make NORAD stand down.
[00:58:17.439 --> 00:58:21.602]  And then that exactly happened on 9-11, and they even attack Afghanistan.
[00:58:21.622 --> 00:58:23.162]  That's the target in that episode.
[00:58:23.963 --> 00:58:30.207]  And then Dean Hagelin, the star of the show, contacts me, shows up at my house and says, it's really weird.
[00:58:30.727 --> 00:58:33.789]  The CIA planted that story on us.
[00:58:35.031 --> 00:58:36.213]  Haha, I mean, yeah!
[00:58:36.534 --> 00:58:38.156]  They just love to let everybody know!
[00:58:38.437 --> 00:58:39.298]  Hey, we did it!
[00:58:44.007 --> 00:58:47.994]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.822 --> 00:58:56.246]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:58:57.466 --> 00:59:02.230]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:17.720]  There's a place down in Tennessee Where they make blue diamond gusset jeans They sew pride in every stitch Guarantee you'll love the way they fit
[00:59:29.489 --> 00:59:31.370]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:33.150]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:35.971]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:40.352]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:59:40.532 --> 00:59:42.552]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:59:42.932 --> 00:59:45.133]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:59:45.633 --> 00:59:47.053]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:59:47.213 --> 00:59:47.654]  Got it.
[00:59:47.994 --> 00:59:48.494]  Others don't.
[00:59:53.368 --> 00:59:55.269]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.749 --> 00:59:58.610]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.093 --> 01:00:05.733]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.393 --> 01:00:07.434]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.174 --> 01:00:09.255]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.915 --> 01:00:10.735]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.516 --> 01:00:13.416]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.436 --> 01:00:16.658]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:21.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:28.794]  Okay, we are continuing with your phone calls.
[01:00:28.814 --> 01:00:37.665]  Nomi Prins, former managing director of Goldman Sachs, is going to be joining us because there's a lot of even mainstream media discussion about the head of Goldman Sachs.
[01:00:38.146 --> 01:00:40.288]  Will he be indicted for the admitted crimes?
[01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:44.653]  He's hired the former Enron defense attorney, so...
[01:00:45.154 --> 01:00:47.676]  We're going to be breaking all of that down.
[01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:50.778]  Also, we've got, under plug, Craig Roberts joining us.
[01:00:50.858 --> 01:00:55.701]  I've got a lot of other news I want to get into, dealing with Libya, obviously, as that unfolds.
[01:00:56.221 --> 01:01:05.868]  We've got some interesting earthquake news that I'll also get to, where even the New York Times and the USGS, the Geological Survey, admits human activity is causing earthquakes.
[01:01:06.368 --> 01:01:08.830]  Thought that was the stuff of conspiracy theories.
[01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:12.312]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Scott in Idaho.
[01:01:13.012 --> 01:01:13.773]  Welcome, Scott.
[01:01:14.568 --> 01:01:15.769]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:30.379]  Just about those earthquakes, I was wondering if you've ever seen the Navy, the map that was done by the Navy that shows the East and West Coast flooded and basically the United States broken in half along the New Madrid fault line?
[01:01:30.399 --> 01:01:35.082]  Yeah, I've seen different simulation maps, yes.
[01:01:35.603 --> 01:01:37.064]  I don't know if I've seen the one you're talking about.
[01:01:37.847 --> 01:01:46.190]  Yeah, you can just Google a future Navy map, and it was actually a map done by the United States Navy.
[01:01:46.830 --> 01:02:04.717]  But what I want to talk about was another way that we can cut off the money supply to the New World Order, and that would be by way of curtailing the law enforcement growth industry and learning, exercising our rights, knowing our rights in the courts.
[01:02:05.477 --> 01:02:13.221]  For instance, the Rossum food raid, I read where they had to pay quite a substantial amount in bail.
[01:02:13.822 --> 01:02:20.705]  Nobody in this country has to pay bail, Alex, unless they've committed a capital crime.
[01:02:21.065 --> 01:02:24.587]  There's a law in all the court rule books of all the states.
[01:02:24.987 --> 01:02:26.408]  It's called the bail rule.
[01:02:26.548 --> 01:02:27.389]  No, sir, I know.
[01:02:27.909 --> 01:02:28.769]  But the public doesn't.
[01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:29.810]  I'm glad you raised that.
[01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:44.480]  I have been arrested before for political protest here in Austin and they come to you and say, well, a bail bondsman can get here or you can sign this form and both are fraud because it's for a misdemeanor.
[01:02:45.339 --> 01:02:58.322]  And when you sign the form, you waive your rights, and agree you're guilty, and agree to a deferred judification right there, if they choose, and agree to go to all these classes for drug, alcohol abuse, violence.
[01:02:58.882 --> 01:03:01.262]  And so, and the general public's not taught any of this.
[01:03:01.662 --> 01:03:02.863]  They just fill the form out.
[01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:06.803]  I mean, it's all just done by compliance.
[01:03:07.364 --> 01:03:07.984]  Comply.
[01:03:08.004 --> 01:03:12.405]  You know, retina scan to get into your business.
[01:03:12.885 --> 01:03:14.185]  Hand scan to get into
[01:03:16.428 --> 01:03:18.712]  Places like SeaWorld or Disneyland.
[01:03:19.093 --> 01:03:21.897]  We've got to start saying no to this garbage.
[01:03:22.238 --> 01:03:26.064]  Not just like cattle going into the gas chambers.
[01:03:27.965 --> 01:03:36.711]  It's actually a battleground, and the judge and your lawyer and the prosecutor, none of them are on your side.
[01:03:36.931 --> 01:03:43.536]  The Supreme Court decided many years ago that any rights not timely demanded are deemed to be waived.
[01:03:43.876 --> 01:03:49.760]  So unless we're in court demanding our rights, we're continually waiving those rights, and one of those rights
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:51.521]  We're good to go.
[01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:14.072]  You have family in the community, you're employed in the community, and you've never failed to miss a court appearance.
[01:04:14.132 --> 01:04:22.116]  Those four things alone would qualify anybody in any criminal court in this country to be released on their O.R.
[01:04:22.156 --> 01:04:25.718]  But the judge is not going to tell you about that option.
[01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:28.059]  It's all a racket.
[01:04:28.479 --> 01:04:29.320]  It's all a scam.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:31.661]  And they get judges to do little corrupt things at first.
[01:04:32.021 --> 01:04:33.762]  And if they'll agree to it, they move up.
[01:04:34.363 --> 01:04:35.323]  They get support.
[01:04:35.783 --> 01:04:37.725]  They get nominated.
[01:04:38.005 --> 01:04:40.566]  They get elected, depending on what type of court system it is.
[01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:41.527]  You're absolutely right.
[01:04:41.927 --> 01:04:43.028]  We've got to rediscover
[01:04:43.968 --> 01:04:44.529]  The law.
[01:04:44.709 --> 01:04:46.392]  Not say, oh, the courts are corrupt.
[01:04:46.412 --> 01:04:47.294]  Well, yeah, they are corrupt.
[01:04:47.694 --> 01:04:52.242]  But you've got to learn just how corrupt they are to continue to educate the public about it.
[01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:53.644]  They can't stop all of us.
[01:04:54.005 --> 01:04:54.606]  More calls.
[01:04:54.686 --> 01:04:55.367]  A ton of news.
[01:04:55.768 --> 01:04:56.389]  Straight ahead.
[01:04:56.429 --> 01:04:56.930]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.511 --> 01:05:05.432]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:05.772 --> 01:05:09.315]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.335 --> 01:05:11.917]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:11.937 --> 01:05:17.381]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:17.821 --> 01:05:24.026]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.466 --> 01:05:30.008]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.449 --> 01:05:34.130]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:38.632]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:38.912 --> 01:05:44.434]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:44.854 --> 01:05:47.836]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.416 --> 01:05:49.836]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.397 --> 01:05:50.817]  It's here.

[01:06:00.204 --> 01:06:03.547]  Hi folks, Steve Shank and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.
[01:06:03.707 --> 01:06:08.791]  In August, we're celebrating our 30-year anniversary in the long-term food supply industry.
[01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:14.296]  To celebrate, the biggest sale ever, our most popular premier one-year food supply for 30% off.
[01:06:15.737 --> 01:06:18.699]  That's 30% off of our Freedom Food Supply.
[01:06:18.959 --> 01:06:22.861]  You save $536 on each one-year supply.
[01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:25.983]  That's lower than 1981 prices.

[01:06:35.948 --> 01:06:37.869]  You know you need your own food.
[01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:39.190]  But time is running out.

[01:06:59.942 --> 01:07:01.083]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:07:01.103 --> 01:07:07.788]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:07:08.048 --> 01:07:10.329]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:15.793]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:07:15.973 --> 01:07:18.755]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:21.077]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:07:21.337 --> 01:07:27.262]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:07:27.582 --> 01:07:30.784]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:36.508]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:07:36.749 --> 01:07:38.050]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:39.551]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:07:39.691 --> 01:07:42.233]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:07:42.353 --> 01:07:46.416]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:46.576 --> 01:07:48.618]  You can find the video at www.
[01:07:49.378 --> 01:07:51.060]  End of America 3.com.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:53.642]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:07:53.762 --> 01:07:57.506]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:07:57.646 --> 01:07:59.387]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:03.111]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:06.394]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:32.472 --> 01:08:37.354]  We are back live eight minutes into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:08:37.754 --> 01:08:43.476]  Former Goldman Sachs insider Nomi Prins will join us about all the scuttlebutt in the media.
[01:08:43.896 --> 01:08:50.478]  Why has the head of Goldman Sachs, who's been subpoenaed in the last few months by state and federal government,
[01:08:51.238 --> 01:08:58.459]  Why has he gone out and hired the high-powered criminal defense attorney that represented Enron and Ken Lay?
[01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:04.020]  We're going to be going over that with her coming up in about 23 minutes from now.
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:12.462]  I want to go back to your calls, but first let me get into some really interesting news because I've seen a lot dealing with these new chips.
[01:09:13.002 --> 01:09:17.523]  Hospital patients now being microchipped with electronic tattoos.
[01:09:18.553 --> 01:09:22.761]  And many of these are so thin that you can't even see it.
[01:09:22.821 --> 01:09:25.366]  And obviously IBM is coming out with systems.
[01:09:26.468 --> 01:09:27.128]  That's right.
[01:09:54.916 --> 01:10:07.631]  Of this bodily invasion with a trendy high-tech appearance, microchipping sensors are being referred to as electronic tattoos that can even attach to human skin and stretch and move without breaking.
[01:10:07.972 --> 01:10:13.338]  They also have the physical barcodes and high-tech barcodes that are being physically tattooed on.
[01:10:14.019 --> 01:10:15.761]  They're talking about making the military do it.
[01:10:16.141 --> 01:10:19.044]  You can even pull up mainstream news articles about tests with the U.S.
[01:10:19.204 --> 01:10:21.626]  Army where they've had them implanted with chips.
[01:10:22.227 --> 01:10:35.659]  Supposedly, the comparisons of this hair-thin electronic patch like to the chip of an electronic tattoo are being made because of how it adheres to the skin like a temporary tattoo using only water.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:43.022]  The small chip is less than 50 micrometers thick, which is thinner than the diameter of a human hair.
[01:10:43.543 --> 01:10:54.346]  It is being marketed as safe and easy way to temporarily monitor the heart and brain in patients while replacing bulky medical equipment currently being used in hospitals.
[01:10:55.347 --> 01:10:57.407]  And again, all of this has positive uses.
[01:10:59.148 --> 01:11:04.950]  The problem is that it also has oppressive uses, and I'll get to some of those in a moment.
[01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:25.147]  The devices use microelectronics technology called Epidermal Electronic Systems, or EESs, and is said to be a development that will, quote, transform medical sensing technology, computer gaming, and even spy operations, according to a study published last week.
[01:11:26.128 --> 01:11:32.351]  Yeah, they've had some of the big video game heads come out and say, soon, if you want to play on our platforms, you'll have to have a chip.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:34.940]  Including one in your brain!
[01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:38.141]  And it'll be so quick, so easy, because it won't be brain surgery.
[01:11:38.201 --> 01:11:41.682]  It'll be an injection, and it will go to that area of your brain.
[01:11:42.382 --> 01:11:43.982]  This is what they're coming out with.
[01:11:44.622 --> 01:11:55.165]  And as long as it's trendy and cool, and they want to be part of that community, and ooh, the rock stars get it, and the supermodels get it, and you get to interface and game with your favorite supermodel,
[01:11:55.965 --> 01:11:57.706]  Or at least a simulation of her.
[01:11:58.366 --> 01:11:59.247]  You're going to do it.
[01:11:59.327 --> 01:12:05.650]  Oh, you get in the VIP area with the bimbos at the club.
[01:12:05.690 --> 01:12:07.031]  They've had that now for 10 years.
[01:12:07.371 --> 01:12:13.855]  Gotta take the chip at the Baja Beach Club in Barcelona, Spain or we're in Miami, Florida.
[01:12:15.899 --> 01:12:17.080]  This is how they're going to sell it.
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:31.730]  The Pentagon, back in the 70s, was declassified in 2001, said, we're going to make troops take it, make prisoners take it, but also sell it as a security function for children, and we're then going to basically make it trendy and then make it the law.
[01:12:32.642 --> 01:12:38.426]  And they predicted that by 2020, 2025, that almost all Americans will have brain chips.
[01:12:38.926 --> 01:12:40.627]  That's actually in my book, Dissent into Tyranny.
[01:12:40.987 --> 01:12:50.554]  Now out of print, but I have the government documents, but it's available with the PDFs and documents at PrisonPlanet.tv if you'd like to read 9-11 dissent into tyranny.
[01:12:52.975 --> 01:12:54.156]  And print that off and show people.
[01:12:54.176 --> 01:13:01.379]  It actually has the URLs, too, to the Federation of American Scientists, who released the, quote, declassified document.
[01:13:01.859 --> 01:13:06.581]  Then the Army requested them to reclassify it.
[01:13:07.982 --> 01:13:19.347]  Kind of like the Sunshine Project got a declassified document about the Marine Corps testing lethal and non-lethal sprays out of helicopters to wipe out the population.
[01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:21.401]  or not.
[01:13:35.089 --> 01:13:36.991]  Other threats and pressure they did remove it.
[01:13:37.732 --> 01:13:51.028]  Not before it went on the different digital archives out there and we dug that back up again a few weeks ago and I meant to do a report on it but that's the type of stuff all these hundreds of reports that I've mentioned or barely covered on the radio
[01:13:51.869 --> 01:13:53.809]  It's not just going to be whatever the big news of the day is.
[01:13:53.869 --> 01:13:58.070]  It's not just going to be on the show the latest information.
[01:13:58.110 --> 01:14:03.052]  Though that will be there too with my analysis, my view, my take, and my guest analysis.
[01:14:03.712 --> 01:14:07.913]  But it's going to be a lot of big, key issues that aren't getting attention.
[01:14:07.953 --> 01:14:10.393]  That's what we're going to be covering on the show as well.
[01:14:10.553 --> 01:14:13.334]  Analyzing media propaganda and so much more.
[01:14:13.374 --> 01:14:14.294]  I'm so excited about it.
[01:14:14.634 --> 01:14:16.355]  And it's your membership at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:14:17.575 --> 01:14:23.639]  That is the financial support to grow and build this system that's just going to get better and better.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:28.483]  We're going to have a special report tonight, seven o'clock central, at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:14:28.523 --> 01:14:30.684]  So if you're not a member, please become one today.
[01:14:31.165 --> 01:14:39.711]  And starting next week, we're going to roll out some new features on PrisonPlanet.TV as well.
[01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:54.515]  Now continuing, imagine, it says the hair thin chip was developed by an international team of scientists, researchers from the United States, China and Singapore and is described in the Journal of Science and then it goes through it.
[01:14:55.095 --> 01:14:58.919]  Imagine the spy capabilities of this.
[01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:11.589]  You think there's already problems with perverts that own salons or tanning places or gyms where good-looking women are working out who are videotaping women in the shower?
[01:15:12.851 --> 01:15:13.512]  Or getting dressed?
[01:15:13.532 --> 01:15:19.836]  You think there's a problem with public schools under federal grants watching kids over their laptops at home and admitting it?
[01:15:20.356 --> 01:15:25.860]  Or putting them in the school bathrooms just to see if they can get away with it?
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.661]  And in most places they do.
[01:15:28.001 --> 01:15:30.082]  You ever watch your sons and daughters shower?
[01:15:30.743 --> 01:15:31.643]  It's for their security.
[01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:39.048]  And then from Tennessee to California, it's come out in mainstream news that it's hooked into federal nets.
[01:15:39.689 --> 01:15:41.310]  And the feds are watching your kids.
[01:15:43.815 --> 01:15:46.097]  Stick their hands down your pants at the airport.
[01:15:46.438 --> 01:15:47.399]  Microwave you.
[01:15:47.699 --> 01:15:49.100]  It's all about pimping.
[01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:51.903]  It's all about the pimp game.
[01:15:51.923 --> 01:15:56.808]  It's all about dominating, breaking your will, training you to accept more and more.
[01:15:57.549 --> 01:15:58.910]  Moving the Overton window.
[01:16:00.071 --> 01:16:01.152]  What's the Overton window?
[01:16:01.392 --> 01:16:02.974]  We've talked about it for more than a decade.
[01:16:03.715 --> 01:16:05.016]  Len Beck's got a book out about it.
[01:16:06.684 --> 01:16:07.785]  That's why I'm mad at Glenn Beck.
[01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:14.210]  Because the book is so accurate and so good, how can he then not tell the whole truth once he's on the air?
[01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:16.572]  Well, I guess he did start telling the truth and got fired.
[01:16:17.853 --> 01:16:19.594]  I don't want to get off into Glenn Beck.
[01:16:20.134 --> 01:16:24.498]  The point is, is that the Overton window is what is politically acceptable.
[01:16:25.478 --> 01:16:29.822]  Fifty years ago, America was a different, safer place in many respects.
[01:16:31.581 --> 01:16:33.821]  But the family's a thing of the past in many cases.
[01:16:33.901 --> 01:16:35.282]  It's under assault where it's left.
[01:16:35.702 --> 01:16:36.642]  Crime has exploded.
[01:16:36.722 --> 01:16:37.962]  Society's degenerated.
[01:16:38.442 --> 01:16:40.663]  They have moved the Overton window.
[01:16:42.383 --> 01:16:44.063]  They have gotten you to accept anything.
[01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:47.964]  And that's why they're going, yeah, there are some camps for your safety now.
[01:16:48.284 --> 01:16:50.565]  But you're still a conspiracy theorist if you think they're bad.
[01:16:50.585 --> 01:16:51.725]  They're there to help you.
[01:16:53.645 --> 01:16:53.985]  Okay?
[01:16:55.186 --> 01:16:57.086]  Now, speaking of drones,
[01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:08.861]  Big Sis gives green light for drone that tazes suspects from above.
[01:17:11.989 --> 01:17:15.191]  Mini-chopper, and we have some video of this for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:17:15.651 --> 01:17:16.971]  Let's roll that in the background.
[01:17:17.372 --> 01:17:23.795]  Big Sis gives green light for drone that tazes suspects from above.
[01:17:24.535 --> 01:17:31.518]  Now, I remember a decade ago in Jane's Weapons Quarterly seeing these drones that look like flying saucers.
[01:17:31.598 --> 01:17:34.560]  It's just a helicopter blade inside a protective dome.
[01:17:35.899 --> 01:17:42.308]  That have long distance taser rockets they fire at you, similar to what police have fired out of shotguns.
[01:17:45.974 --> 01:17:47.736]  Nerve gas, knockout gas.
[01:17:49.173 --> 01:17:52.456]  Regular shotgun rounds, poison darts, you name it.
[01:17:52.857 --> 01:17:58.923]  Now, they've got a new helicopter out that Big Sis is bellying up to and saying they're going to purchase some of.
[01:17:58.943 --> 01:18:06.871]  Remember a couple of years ago, a company came out with taser bracelets for all air traffic, for all commercial flyers.
[01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:10.855]  Every man, woman, and child will wear a taser bracelet around their
[01:18:13.513 --> 01:18:16.815]  The Shadowhawk is a 50 pound mini drone chopper that can be fitted with the X-ERP taser
[01:18:28.883 --> 01:18:38.830]  With the ability to fire four barbed electrodes that can be shot at a distance of 100 feet, delivering the neuromuscular incapacitation of the victim.
[01:18:39.531 --> 01:18:47.677]  The drone can travel a top speed of 70 miles per hour and can operate for 3.5 hours over land and sea.
[01:18:48.237 --> 01:18:55.923]  And it shows them chasing the evil patriots here in the videos, the company videos, very proud of it, chasing them down.
[01:18:57.972 --> 01:19:00.713]  And catching them, that way the officers don't have to get in danger.
[01:19:00.973 --> 01:19:04.994]  Ah, yes, but is it a crack dealer selling government crack shipped in?
[01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.534]  No, it's not that type of criminal.
[01:19:07.254 --> 01:19:12.736]  No, it's the person who was trying to run to the hills to get away from the system.
[01:19:12.756 --> 01:19:13.876]  They didn't want to take the chip.
[01:19:13.896 --> 01:19:18.337]  They didn't want to turn their kids over for the new behavioral injection.
[01:19:18.897 --> 01:19:24.881]  That they are now rolling out and announcing that you'll take these shots and never get angry at the government again, never be depressed again.
[01:19:25.322 --> 01:19:29.124]  Times of London, Associated Press, he doesn't want to take the shot.
[01:19:29.524 --> 01:19:39.671]  Oh, you better believe those operating the helicopter or the computer systems that will operate them in the future, without the need of man, you know they've had their injections in this near-future dystopia.
[01:19:40.612 --> 01:19:46.276]  But did the near-future dystopia deliver the life extension that Steve Jobs was looking for?
[01:19:48.519 --> 01:19:49.700]  No, it didn't deliver it.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:55.303]  You can keep somebody alive for seven years that would normally die in one year from that form of cancer.
[01:19:56.644 --> 01:20:00.686]  So see, all the evil arrived, but all the goodies that were to be for you, it's not going to.

[01:21:15.501 --> 01:21:16.762]  For a limited time, you get 30% off.
[01:21:19.385 --> 01:21:19.885]  I don't know.
[01:21:36.852 --> 01:21:37.212]  Call 800-409-5633
[01:22:00.521 --> 01:22:06.004]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack.
[01:22:06.245 --> 01:22:09.206]  The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994.
[01:22:10.407 --> 01:22:15.690]  Governments are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable price.
[01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:21.774]  Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised growing conditions.
[01:22:22.094 --> 01:22:28.381]  Storable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies.
[01:22:28.681 --> 01:22:36.068]  Go to SurvivalRx.com today and see the amazing line of storable supplements they have to protect the ones you love.
[01:22:36.389 --> 01:22:45.218]  The owners of SurvivalRx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize the need for long-term storable vitamins.
[01:22:45.618 --> 01:22:51.622]  The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades.
[01:22:51.982 --> 01:22:54.903]  Again, go to survivalrx.com.
[01:22:55.164 --> 01:22:57.145]  That's survivalrx.com.
[01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:02.712]  Are you tired of spending money for metal canning lids year after year?
[01:23:02.953 --> 01:23:03.653]  Then stop!
[01:23:04.153 --> 01:23:07.175]  Stop buying metal lids and get Tattler reusable canning lids.
[01:23:07.576 --> 01:23:14.740]  Made of USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, Tattler canning lids let you safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[01:23:15.081 --> 01:23:18.743]  Traditional metal lids are single use throwaways that contain BPA.
[01:23:19.083 --> 01:23:25.388]  But Tattler canning lids are indefinitely reusable and guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[01:23:25.748 --> 01:23:27.289]  And contain no BPA.
[01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.070]  Tattler lids are dishwasher safe.
[01:23:29.310 --> 01:23:37.673]  Perfect for standard pressure or water bath canning, eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion, fit standard mason jars, and are proudly made in the USA.
[01:23:38.033 --> 01:23:39.333]  Place orders by phone at 877-747-2793.
[01:23:39.353 --> 01:23:40.894]  Or go to reusablecanninglids.com.
[01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:41.374]  That's 1-877-747-2793.
[01:23:41.394 --> 01:23:42.474]  Or go to reusablecanninglids.com.
[01:23:42.494 --> 01:23:43.294]  That's reusablecanninglids.com.
[01:23:43.314 --> 01:23:44.595]  Tattler Reusable Canning Lids.
[01:23:44.635 --> 01:23:45.215]  The original since 1976.
[01:24:21.002 --> 01:24:30.736]  I would warn people 16 years ago about the military training police, working with police, secretly being involved in law enforcement activities.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.662]  And folks would say, that's insane.
[01:24:33.682 --> 01:24:34.984]  We're not a third world country.
[01:24:36.145 --> 01:24:37.527]  We're not Soviet Russia.
[01:24:38.088 --> 01:24:39.349]  Come on, that's crazy.
[01:24:39.369 --> 01:24:40.431]  And I'm like, well, here's the proof.
[01:24:40.771 --> 01:24:41.873]  Here's the Rand Corporation.
[01:24:41.913 --> 01:24:42.674]  Here's documents.
[01:24:43.134 --> 01:24:44.155]  Here's eyewitnesses.
[01:24:44.556 --> 01:24:50.523]  Here's an emergency manager from Kingsville, Texas, who's a veteran who was approached about martial law preparations.
[01:24:51.991 --> 01:24:58.798]  I mean, this stuff is going on, and it's been going on for a long time as the banker's eye taking this country down.
[01:24:59.078 --> 01:25:05.465]  They're making great profits creating the derivatives in the last 15 years to buy the world up through their fraud.
[01:25:06.265 --> 01:25:13.453]  But in the final equation, if they don't then put in a dictatorship of the military-industrial complex,
[01:25:14.594 --> 01:25:18.777]  Then the oligarchs will end up getting in trouble for wrecking the society.
[01:25:19.298 --> 01:25:23.641]  But if they wreck it, then they get to take it over if they stay in charge.
[01:25:24.081 --> 01:25:24.882]  It's very simple.
[01:25:25.182 --> 01:25:27.784]  That's why they will bring in hardcore tyranny.
[01:25:28.144 --> 01:25:29.505]  Because they know you've woken up.
[01:25:29.885 --> 01:25:31.667]  They know you're only going to get more and more awake.
[01:25:31.947 --> 01:25:37.251]  So they're racing to try to find police and military that will engage in thuggism.
[01:25:38.544 --> 01:25:52.089]  And they know a lot of police and military won't do it in person to person, so they're going to robots, they're going to drones, they're going to combat remote control mini-tanks that pack incredible firepower.
[01:25:52.809 --> 01:26:02.773]  And they're now moving towards pre-programmed, where if you don't have the right transponder code, they just send these weapons in and send these robots in, and they've been using them for
[01:26:03.519 --> 01:26:06.481]  At least eight years in Iraq, in Fallujah and other areas.
[01:26:07.062 --> 01:26:09.504]  I mean, here come robots that kill you dead in a hammer.
[01:26:10.084 --> 01:26:13.247]  And they're only showing the public 30-year-old technology.
[01:26:13.888 --> 01:26:21.534]  I'm going to tell you again, I had family involved in development 40-plus years ago in robots for crowd control.
[01:26:23.376 --> 01:26:28.020]  My grandfather was given a government contract for it, but they only bought the prototypes.
[01:26:28.841 --> 01:26:30.462]  This is what they've been obsessed with.
[01:26:30.942 --> 01:26:35.506]  They do not want to have to rely on humans.
[01:26:36.447 --> 01:26:50.959]  They're moving into systems where robots work on the robots, where a remote-control robot 18-wheeler goes out and picks up the broken-down robot, drives it back to a robot facility with robots working on robots.
[01:26:51.559 --> 01:26:52.740]  They don't have it down yet.
[01:26:53.221 --> 01:27:00.750]  They've got the truck that'll go, they've got the assembly line that works, they've got robots that work on the robots, but they still gotta have humans that then work on that.
[01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:04.073]  But they're getting very close to not needing us.
[01:27:04.634 --> 01:27:09.520]  And that's why the founder of Apple talked about, we're gonna be computers' pets.
[01:27:10.592 --> 01:27:15.336]  We're going to be the elite's pets who've programmed the computers to program us.
[01:27:15.796 --> 01:27:20.740]  It's come out that computer games, TV, all these iPads, they're programming us.
[01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:22.781]  They're changing the way we think.
[01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:24.582]  That's why they call it programming.
[01:27:25.663 --> 01:27:26.724]  This is the reality.
[01:27:27.765 --> 01:27:35.010]  And so, of course, at an instinctive level and at an intellectual level, I see the balance of power way out of whack.
[01:27:36.171 --> 01:27:37.132]  I see predatory.
[01:27:38.613 --> 01:27:47.758]  Anti-human, very sadistic, psychopathic elites, bare minimum sociopathic, and they enjoy their work.
[01:27:50.159 --> 01:27:57.603]  I see them coming in and amassing this giant arms race against humanity.
[01:27:58.663 --> 01:28:05.667]  Weaponizing the food, building in systems to reduce fertility and increase cancer, on record, every major GMO crop.
[01:28:06.653 --> 01:28:08.254]  Has had that engineered into the back door.
[01:28:09.014 --> 01:28:14.257]  You think the function is to use less water, or be able to live in this certain herbicide?
[01:28:14.278 --> 01:28:15.018]  Uh-uh.
[01:28:15.518 --> 01:28:16.879]  That's only one of the functions.
[01:28:16.939 --> 01:28:18.180]  It has multiple traits.
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:21.062]  They go, it's a side effect that's killing honeybees.
[01:28:21.122 --> 01:28:23.303]  It's a side effect that's reducing fertility.
[01:28:23.603 --> 01:28:26.805]  It's a side effect Bt corn being eaten all over the world.
[01:28:27.345 --> 01:28:31.748]  Soon it'll be the majority corn that you're eating is causing birth defects.
[01:28:33.505 --> 01:28:35.846]  Is causing massive cancer increases.
[01:28:35.866 --> 01:28:36.446]  Don't believe me?
[01:28:37.147 --> 01:28:40.728]  Just type in BT corn linked to cancer.
[01:28:41.268 --> 01:28:41.908]  Infertility.
[01:28:42.089 --> 01:28:43.149]  You'll get mainstream news.
[01:28:43.769 --> 01:28:46.330]  It's a trait engineered on purpose.
[01:28:48.051 --> 01:28:51.472]  This is the situation that we're facing.
[01:28:51.532 --> 01:28:56.634]  This is the situation that we're dealing with as a society and a civilization.
[01:28:56.674 --> 01:28:57.655]  We're under attack.
[01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:04.270]  You know, I told you years ago that they're putting different radioactive isotopes in the water supplies.
[01:29:04.410 --> 01:29:09.933]  I beat the drum loud enough, suddenly I saw newscasts all over the country going, we don't know why there's radiation in the water.
[01:29:10.353 --> 01:29:11.554]  The government covered it up.
[01:29:11.874 --> 01:29:13.575]  Rick Perry covered it up in Texas.
[01:29:14.296 --> 01:29:17.538]  And they go, oh gee, it must be in the aquifers, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:18.198 --> 01:29:20.199]  It's in the sodium fluoride.
[01:29:20.479 --> 01:29:22.901]  They mine it out of phosphate mines where it comes from.
[01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:25.242]  That alone, does it tell you?
[01:29:25.942 --> 01:29:28.064]  They've been doing this for 50-something years.
[01:29:29.622 --> 01:29:30.662]  The IQs have dropped.
[01:29:31.923 --> 01:29:33.123]  The diseases have gone up.
[01:29:34.084 --> 01:29:37.425]  That one piece of evidence, does it give you an idea how evil they are?
[01:29:38.685 --> 01:29:41.706]  And so they're amassing all this firepower against us right now.
[01:29:42.407 --> 01:29:45.188]  They're gearing up for their war against humanity.
[01:29:45.608 --> 01:29:47.728]  The Globalist, with the machines.
[01:29:47.828 --> 01:29:48.509]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:50.749 --> 01:29:51.670]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.150 --> 01:29:53.751]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.671 --> 01:29:57.392]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.559 --> 01:30:05.840]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:12.102]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:30:12.682 --> 01:30:14.422]  Number one, study the past.
[01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.703]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:30:17.343 --> 01:30:21.064]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:30:22.205 --> 01:30:24.467]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:30:25.287 --> 01:30:28.549]  A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:30:29.130 --> 01:30:33.853]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves.
[01:30:34.173 --> 01:30:37.635]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:30:38.176 --> 01:30:41.058]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:30:41.598 --> 01:30:45.220]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:30:46.061 --> 01:30:50.325]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.
[01:30:51.005 --> 01:30:57.811]  Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com
[01:31:01.118 --> 01:31:04.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:08.142]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.382 --> 01:31:13.165]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.185 --> 01:31:19.408]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:19.569 --> 01:31:21.810]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:23.771]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:31:23.831 --> 01:31:24.612]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:24.952 --> 01:31:27.354]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.246 --> 01:31:48.148]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:48.528 --> 01:31:57.631]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:01.547 --> 01:32:05.188]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.508 --> 01:32:13.650]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.370 --> 01:32:18.411]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:19.011 --> 01:32:29.813]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.453 --> 01:32:39.455]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.955 --> 01:32:44.996]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.397 --> 01:32:52.558]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:52.878 --> 01:32:55.639]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:00.031 --> 01:33:00.591]  We've got it.
[01:33:00.631 --> 01:33:07.056]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:33:07.156 --> 01:33:11.259]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:11.539 --> 01:33:19.925]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:25.853 --> 01:33:36.097]  Alright, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:36.117 --> 01:33:37.077]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:33:37.097 --> 01:33:41.479]  Coming up in the last 30 minutes of the next hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be on.
[01:33:42.039 --> 01:33:46.701]  For those of you that are holding, I promise I'll get to your calls at the start of the next hour if you don't want to hold for 30 minutes.
[01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:51.984]  For 27 minutes, technically, you can hang up and call back later.
[01:33:52.004 --> 01:33:55.687]  800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[01:33:56.507 --> 01:33:59.769]  I haven't gotten to this news yet, but I'll also cover it in the next hour.
[01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:01.571]  It's official.
[01:34:01.651 --> 01:34:03.932]  Human activity can cause earthquakes.
[01:34:04.192 --> 01:34:11.638]  Excellent boil-down at Infowars.com by the USGS, New York Times, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.
[01:34:12.618 --> 01:34:22.442]  I mentioned this, of course, yesterday and the day before that, that the Denver Post quoted USGS admitting that humans can trigger earthquakes.
[01:34:23.223 --> 01:34:29.966]  You can trigger earthquakes with pretty small explosives if they're drilled in at a key computer model juncture.
[01:34:30.922 --> 01:34:33.504]  And I mentioned this, we'll cover it next hour.
[01:34:33.524 --> 01:34:35.926]  I should do a special report on this actually.
[01:34:36.427 --> 01:34:41.811]  An Israeli company bragged and has proven that they can drop little bomblets.
[01:34:42.992 --> 01:35:02.909]  On the ground that then detonate and then they've got systems that then measure the bomblets as they like sonar bounce down through the earth into the fault lines and show them the absolute computer model where even a couple hundred pounds of plastic explosives if drilled they've got a drill like an oil well
[01:35:03.610 --> 01:35:07.033]  Sometimes tens of thousands of feet, but normally it's more shallow.
[01:35:08.134 --> 01:35:09.435]  There's diagrams on all this.
[01:35:10.436 --> 01:35:11.336]  They drill in.
[01:35:11.356 --> 01:35:14.579]  The Russians can do it, but the Israelis are more open about it.
[01:35:15.339 --> 01:35:18.002]  They drill in, detonate the plastic explosive.
[01:35:18.362 --> 01:35:18.842]  Voila!
[01:35:18.902 --> 01:35:19.343]  Earthquake.
[01:35:19.723 --> 01:35:25.988]  Now, they've got systems where smaller nukes can be placed that could cause above tens on the Richter scale.
[01:35:26.488 --> 01:35:28.090]  I'm talking end-of-the-world type stuff.
[01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:30.371]  Mountains shooting up, you know, in seconds.
[01:35:31.696 --> 01:35:33.057]  Wild stuff going on.
[01:35:33.958 --> 01:35:35.779]  Now, that's only with explosives.
[01:35:36.279 --> 01:35:37.580]  And the USGS admits this.
[01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.761]  I'm going to get to it later, as I said.
[01:35:39.361 --> 01:35:40.742]  That's only with explosives.
[01:35:42.003 --> 01:35:50.029]  What you can do with these HAARP systems, and that's in the original patents from the 50s, is it's just like banging a metal barn.
[01:35:50.069 --> 01:35:52.050]  You find the perfect oscillation.
[01:35:52.330 --> 01:35:53.451]  Bang, bang, bang.
[01:35:53.771 --> 01:35:55.613]  You can get the whole building shaking.
[01:35:56.053 --> 01:35:57.294]  I've done it before on accident.
[01:35:58.470 --> 01:36:05.231]  Earlier I was, you know, making some funny voices into the microphone and it caused some weird harmonic thing and made the equipment go crazy.
[01:36:06.812 --> 01:36:11.613]  I've seen at a party an opera singer break a crystal glass hitting that perfect note.
[01:36:12.353 --> 01:36:13.473]  And that's what harp does.
[01:36:13.733 --> 01:36:19.815]  And, well, they can just energize the atmosphere and then bounce it back at the earth and do a lot of crazy stuff.
[01:36:20.175 --> 01:36:24.135]  So I'll be covering that for 10 minutes or so in the next hour after I take your phone calls.
[01:36:24.436 --> 01:36:26.176]  We're tracking what's happening in the economy.
[01:36:26.716 --> 01:36:31.519]  There's been a massive plunge, as you know, in the last day or two of Bank of America.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:44.768]  But now it's gone up a bit today because the consummate insider, the Rothschild agent, Warren Buffett, has been running around saying that he's investing heavily in it and bought a bunch of stock in it.
[01:36:44.788 --> 01:36:45.508]  So now it's gone up.
[01:36:45.528 --> 01:36:50.852]  So Mr. Wells Fargo now running over to one of the other big six megabanks and trying to prop it up.
[01:36:51.272 --> 01:36:54.234]  And a real expert on this is Nomi Prins.
[01:36:54.774 --> 01:37:00.077]  Author of It Takes a Pillage, Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.
[01:37:00.978 --> 01:37:02.719]  And she's got a new book coming out.
[01:37:03.439 --> 01:37:04.259]  Nomi Prins.
[01:37:04.279 --> 01:37:05.780]  People keep calling me going, it's Naomi.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:06.661]  No, it's Nomi.
[01:37:06.901 --> 01:37:07.982]  N-O-M-I.
[01:37:08.322 --> 01:37:08.802]  Prins.
[01:37:08.862 --> 01:37:09.883]  P-R-I-N-S.
[01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:23.630]  She of course was a managing director at Goldman Sachs and also ran a lot of the key groups breaking down global trends and actuaries, so quite the brain.
[01:37:24.931 --> 01:37:32.115]  And she joins us to go over the Bank of America situation, but also her article that's gotten a lot of attention out of the Daily Beast.
[01:37:32.815 --> 01:37:33.196]  I've seen
[01:37:34.076 --> 01:37:38.580]  Other mainstream reports saying, is Blankfein about to be indicted?
[01:37:38.901 --> 01:37:40.702]  Because there's been some subpoenas and things.
[01:37:41.023 --> 01:37:46.247]  He's hired the biggest criminal defense lawyer you can hire for corporate fraud and corruption.
[01:37:47.386 --> 01:37:48.807]  The former big Enron lawyer.
[01:37:49.427 --> 01:37:52.709]  And so he may not just be worried about an SEC wrist slap.
[01:37:52.970 --> 01:37:55.511]  She'll break that down for us as well.
[01:37:55.631 --> 01:37:59.234]  So Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway invests $5 billion to Bank of America.
[01:37:59.714 --> 01:38:02.316]  We're going to get that inside take from her.
[01:38:02.536 --> 01:38:03.797]  And could blank fine.
[01:38:03.837 --> 01:38:09.540]  She used to, again, be one of the big head honchos in the power structure over there at Goldman Sachs.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.341]  And Nomi Prins.
[01:38:10.381 --> 01:38:11.722]  Nomi, thank you for joining us.
[01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:13.521]  Thanks a lot for having me back, Alex.
[01:38:28.761 --> 01:38:29.922]  It's all up there.
[01:38:30.222 --> 01:38:37.048]  Let's start with Buffett, because, you know, this, yeah, she started with a $5 billion deal with Bank of America.
[01:38:37.068 --> 01:38:38.430]  Of course, it's related to Goldman.
[01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:45.056]  Buffett put a $10 billion deal together with Goldman Sachs, which is very similar to this, when Goldman was facing
[01:38:46.497 --> 01:38:46.738]  I think so.
[01:39:01.630 --> 01:39:10.415]  Doing the same thing, the same thing, not just putting money into Bank of America for preferred stock, meaning if Bank of America fails, he's there first.
[01:39:10.455 --> 01:39:11.716]  He gets his money out first.
[01:39:11.756 --> 01:39:12.896]  That's how that deal works.
[01:39:13.036 --> 01:39:16.198]  And he's going to get 6% dividend interest on it in the meantime.
[01:39:16.218 --> 01:39:21.441]  He's betting, really, that the government will not let Bank of America fail.
[01:39:22.041 --> 01:39:22.322]  Again.
[01:39:22.342 --> 01:39:26.264]  Now, this is after the government has
[01:39:27.481 --> 01:39:40.804]  Propped up, Bank of America had forced a deal where Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch, which no one cares about anymore, which had a ton of toxic assets in it, and is dealing with the countrywide investigations and everything else.
[01:39:41.164 --> 01:39:47.966]  And the government had infused Bank of America with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of guarantees and subsidies and bailouts and everything else.
[01:39:48.326 --> 01:39:52.647]  A lot of which has gone away or been paid back, but that is why Bank of America has floated so long.
[01:39:53.107 --> 01:40:13.401]  Buffett is coming in right now and saying, you know what, even with those billions of dollars, even with the fact that Bank of America's stock is back down to where it was in early 2009 when the feds started opening up coffers and there started being all this extra guarantee after TARP coming from the government to help it, even now that it's back at those levels, down back at those levels, he's betting the government won't let it fail again.
[01:40:13.421 --> 01:40:18.245]  That after all of that money that was put in, there will be more put in, if need be, or more
[01:40:20.326 --> 01:40:21.167]  We're good to go.
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:49.806]  Even though, that being said, the market went up, Bank of America stock went up on Buffett's thing, and then it basically, it kind of faltered a bit after that.
[01:40:50.307 --> 01:41:02.055]  So, that shows us that even given that logic, even given Buffett, even given the fact that the government will not let this big bank fail, though it should, that the market doesn't believe it.
[01:41:03.236 --> 01:41:20.954]  That just like a question what was going on back in fall of 2008 and spring of 2009, there's a lot of pain that will still be inflicted upon us by these banks as they continue to show us that they are not stable, that they don't do business appropriately, and that they are
[01:41:22.359 --> 01:41:23.140]  Zombie banks.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.961]  And that's what's going on right now.
[01:41:24.981 --> 01:41:32.344]  So Buffett came in, but I think that's gonna... That will be bad for us, I think, and good for Buffett.
[01:41:32.385 --> 01:41:37.447]  Buffett, of course, is also going to be hosting a big fundraiser for Obama going forward.
[01:41:37.487 --> 01:41:44.391]  So, I mean, I think he knows very well that the government won't let this institution fail, and that's why he's in there.
[01:41:44.811 --> 01:41:55.202]  Sure, so they're just loading more of their stolen loot from derivatives and things into the bigger zombie banks, and at the same time, they think that'll prop them up.
[01:41:55.983 --> 01:42:00.067]  Nomi, how do you see this global financial meltdown unfolding?
[01:42:00.087 --> 01:42:05.192]  Because, you know, the German stocks are way down today, and gold, of course, went above $1,900 in the last few days.
[01:42:07.114 --> 01:42:18.002]  Clearly, we're sliding deeper into the global abyss, but the parasitic central banks, they're getting record bonuses, so I guess they're doing okay.
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:35.145]  And the central banks, from the Fed to the ECB, these are institutions that are continuing to prop up the illusion that these banks are doing something good for the rest of us, or are viable, or should be helped.
[01:42:35.665 --> 01:42:48.389]  And what we're seeing in Europe, and what we're seeing with Bank of America and other things here, is that you can throw in all the money you want, at some point the illusion of puffiness that that cheap money creates, that those guarantees and backing creates,
[01:42:48.789 --> 01:42:51.211]  Because it isn't real, will implode.
[01:42:51.251 --> 01:42:56.796]  And what's being seen right now in Europe is that the European banks, and they have the same issues that the U.S.
[01:42:56.876 --> 01:43:01.940]  banks had, you know, for different reasons, different timing, it unfolded sort of more slowly.
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:11.429]  But what we're seeing there now is that these institutions are simply not viable, and yet the central banks continue to dump money into them, extracting it with deals against
[01:43:12.498 --> 01:43:25.983]  Populations, you know, inflicting austerity measures on populations in order to fund and create more debt in order to float these countries and their banking systems so that investors in these banks and senior executives in these banks will continue to get paid.
[01:43:26.203 --> 01:43:27.084]  That's what's going on here.
[01:43:27.104 --> 01:43:36.147]  That transfer of wealth to investors and to senior executives of banks by central banks, by federal institutions continues to go on.
[01:43:36.187 --> 01:43:37.528]  We're now into year three of this.
[01:43:38.488 --> 01:43:39.889]  It's completely a disaster.
[01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:42.091]  What we're seeing unfold will continue to unfold.
[01:43:42.151 --> 01:43:43.533]  I've talked about this on your show.
[01:43:43.593 --> 01:43:44.493]  I continue to believe it.
[01:43:44.874 --> 01:43:49.838]  I saw a clip of myself talking about this three and a half years ago, that this is 1929 going into the 30s.
[01:43:49.858 --> 01:43:52.140]  This is what we're dealing with right now.
[01:43:52.740 --> 01:43:58.005]  And our governments and European governments are playing into that.
[01:43:58.545 --> 01:44:01.228]  And it's very negative for main populations.
[01:44:01.868 --> 01:44:05.051]  And I don't see them changing what they're doing.
[01:44:05.111 --> 01:44:05.611]  We're good to go.
[01:44:35.254 --> 01:44:41.596]  A value that is attached to some actual real commodity, which is gold.
[01:44:41.656 --> 01:44:57.681]  And that's why we're seeing the gold price go up, and that's why we'll continue to see the gold price go up, because there is no viable solution coming from those that have the money to print or the money to spend throwing good money or good printed money after bad.
[01:44:59.704 --> 01:45:02.385]  Well, Nelmie... It's very annoying.
[01:45:02.725 --> 01:45:04.126]  It's very, you know, we talk about it.
[01:45:04.666 --> 01:45:24.814]  It could be so simple and what is happening and the decisions being made and the way that money is being printed and the way that it's being used to float a non-viable financial system continues to implode before our eyes and yet those in power do nothing and recognize none of this as it continues to unfold.
[01:45:25.404 --> 01:45:28.187]  Well, they consciously understand what they're doing.
[01:45:28.227 --> 01:45:30.249]  It's not just that they fail to recognize it.
[01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:43.701]  They plan on imploding the global economy, consolidating it, setting up tax systems to destroy industrial bases in the West, and then basically making us all welfare slaves to their largesse.
[01:45:46.617 --> 01:45:52.819]  And they intend to get away with their great crimes by installing a paramilitary tyranny over us.
[01:45:53.239 --> 01:45:55.979]  The only question is, will they get away with that?
[01:45:56.140 --> 01:46:00.581]  Are we going to let them get away with this?
[01:46:00.741 --> 01:46:05.202]  Now let's talk about the head of Goldman Sachs, the guy that says
[01:46:06.022 --> 01:46:08.564]  Uh, he's doing God's work, or was that Jamie Dimon?
[01:46:08.584 --> 01:46:10.225]  Was it Blankfein who said he was doing God's work?
[01:46:10.285 --> 01:46:12.647]  No, it was Blankfein who said he was doing God's work.
[01:46:12.707 --> 01:46:18.671]  Yeah, so he's doing God's work here, and they've had Senate committees, as you know, come out and say, yes, this is all illegal.
[01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:22.353]  They knowingly created and packaged up that was, uh...
[01:46:23.254 --> 01:46:30.656]  Totally worthless and sold it to the world and then held everybody hostage saying prop us up or or we'll take you down with us.
[01:46:31.396 --> 01:46:38.638]  And then now they've gotten the bailout money and they've continued the same old activities and are saying we'll bail us out again while we get record bonuses.
[01:46:39.038 --> 01:46:49.480]  I mean somebody has got to take the wheel of this car, this train away from these people, Nomi.
[01:46:50.921 --> 01:46:52.101]  So let's go over your article.
[01:46:53.021 --> 01:46:54.588]  And the reports that he's hired this big lawyer.
[01:46:55.726 --> 01:47:04.192]  Yeah, so basically this April, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the PSI, came out with a report, a 650-page report.
[01:47:04.752 --> 01:47:09.035]  It mentions Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman, about 79 times.
[01:47:09.676 --> 01:47:13.559]  And about 250, 270 pages of this report is just on Goldman.
[01:47:13.579 --> 01:47:21.424]  The report's supposed to be about all of the abuses and crimes of the banking system at large, but it is about a third to more than that specifically on Goldman.
[01:47:21.444 --> 01:47:25.087]  So a fairly large chunk falls upon three major deals.
[01:47:26.127 --> 01:47:32.769]  I mean, I encourage people to look at it.
[01:47:32.849 --> 01:47:33.769]  It's long, but it's damning.
[01:47:33.789 --> 01:47:50.073]  You know, they basically knowingly took crappy assets and stuffed them into client investment vehicles, into things called CDOs, and they basically didn't give all the information to their clients as to what was going on on the other side, which is that they were shorting or betting against
[01:47:50.874 --> 01:47:55.739]  Not just the market, which is what Lloyd Blankfein continued to say, that we are just market makers.
[01:47:55.799 --> 01:47:56.640]  We are doing our job.
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.723]  If some people want to short the market, we'll short it.
[01:47:58.763 --> 01:48:00.505]  If some people want to go long, we'll go long.
[01:48:00.765 --> 01:48:04.129]  If some investors wanted to take more risk, they knew what they were doing.
[01:48:04.169 --> 01:48:05.730]  They paid for that risk back then.
[01:48:06.031 --> 01:48:06.631]  They took it.
[01:48:06.952 --> 01:48:07.773]  They're big boys.
[01:48:08.033 --> 01:48:09.355]  You know, we're just doing our job.
[01:48:09.795 --> 01:48:21.907]  But the problem is, that only works if you're not committing fraud or misleading your investors by not indicating the true value that you attribute to those assets you're stuffing into their security.
[01:48:22.427 --> 01:48:32.197]  And the report, in a lot of different detail, shows emails and exchanges and internal documentation going on at Goldman that is indirect.
[01:48:32.717 --> 01:48:33.117]  We're good to go.
[01:48:55.029 --> 01:49:08.956]  The value, not 100% as blank, they were not fortune tellers, but they had more information on the value of the assets they stuffed, that they were called cats and dogs at the Senate Subcommittee, into these securities that they did not tell their clients.
[01:49:09.416 --> 01:49:10.676]  And that's fraud.
[01:49:11.117 --> 01:49:20.401]  You know, if someone sells you a car, and the engine doesn't work, and the brakes don't work, and they don't tell you to get out of the lot, and maybe you didn't try the brakes and you shouldn't, but all of a sudden you tried and you slammed
[01:49:20.461 --> 01:49:31.445]  That's the crux of why he ultimately, under subpoena for the Department of Justice, went and hired a big-time defense lawyer, a guy who has represented Bernie Ebers, who by the way is in jail, WorldCom CEO, for 25 years, a 25-year sentence.
[01:49:49.225 --> 01:49:54.029]  Uh, Richard Causey, who was the senior accountant in Ron, um, who was also in jail.
[01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:58.553]  Um, and a number of other, uh, big high-profile criminals.
[01:49:59.354 --> 01:50:02.396]  Um, and that's the guy that is now representing Lloyd Blankfein.
[01:50:02.416 --> 01:50:03.958]  That's not a good pack to be with.
[01:50:05.489 --> 01:50:07.149]  Well, we know he's been subpoenaed.
[01:50:07.410 --> 01:50:19.753]  The problem is, as you state in your article, the SEC is a revolving door made up of crooks from Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America, all these big insiders.
[01:50:20.473 --> 01:50:25.955]  And so, it came out last week that they destroyed thousands of documents.
[01:50:26.015 --> 01:50:31.816]  Anytime a whistleblower brought them stuff about the big guys being corrupt, it got shredded, it got destroyed.
[01:50:31.856 --> 01:50:34.277]  We know for 11 years they covered up for Bernie Madoff.
[01:50:35.097 --> 01:50:39.339]  And Madoff has rightly said, hey, I did this because that's how business is done here.
[01:50:39.699 --> 01:50:41.900]  And to be competitive, I had to engage in fraud.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:44.121]  This is all Ponzi schemes.
[01:50:44.201 --> 01:50:45.641]  Why am I the one going to jail?
[01:50:45.961 --> 01:50:47.742]  Well, he was lower down the totem pole.
[01:50:48.042 --> 01:50:53.284]  Sure, he founded Nasdaq and was high powered, but not at that super big six bank level.
[01:50:53.704 --> 01:50:58.046]  So only Lloyd Blankfein and people like that are allowed to do this and Ben Bernanke.
[01:50:58.486 --> 01:50:59.227]  Not Madoff.
[01:50:59.267 --> 01:50:59.887]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:00.387 --> 01:51:07.671]  Did you know nuclear radiation is still spewing out of the melted-down reactors in Fukushima, Japan, and making its way across the entire U.S.
[01:51:07.711 --> 01:51:10.492]  continent, contaminating the air, water, and food?
[01:51:10.732 --> 01:51:13.493]  Dangerously high levels of radiation are a reality here.
[01:51:13.734 --> 01:51:20.437]  As a result, radiation poisoning is a distinct possibility for anyone living in the U.S., unless you do something to protect yourself.
[01:51:20.737 --> 01:51:20.997]  How?
[01:51:21.297 --> 01:51:24.258]  With Liquid Zeolite from RestoreYourHealthNow.com.

[01:52:01.488 --> 01:52:05.772]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply.
[01:52:06.192 --> 01:52:12.038]  Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:52:12.619 --> 01:52:14.360]  Number one, study the past.
[01:52:14.901 --> 01:52:16.662]  History really does repeat itself.
[01:52:17.283 --> 01:52:21.026]  Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:52:22.136 --> 01:52:24.398]  Number three, take decisive action.
[01:52:25.218 --> 01:52:28.501]  A perfect storm is brewing for a global food crisis.
[01:52:29.061 --> 01:52:37.567]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves, warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history.
[01:52:38.127 --> 01:52:40.989]  Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits.
[01:52:41.530 --> 01:52:45.132]  This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:52:46.013 --> 01:52:50.254]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, How to Cut Your Grocery Bills in Half.

[01:53:00.437 --> 01:53:04.599]  Life Before the Collapse, Final LP by The Lost Vegas.
[01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:14.902]  How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
[01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:29.435]  I think so.
[01:53:39.378 --> 01:53:48.509]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas on 180 gram vinyl and mastered especially for vinyl by legendary audio engineer Steve Hall.
[01:53:52.974 --> 01:53:58.661]  Life Before the Collapse by The Lost Vegas now available at Amazon.com
[01:54:11.678 --> 01:54:14.301]  Coming up...
[01:54:31.007 --> 01:54:34.272]  In the last 30 minutes of the next hour, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is joining us.
[01:54:34.312 --> 01:54:38.358]  He's got a great article out that was published at InfoWars.com last night.
[01:54:38.378 --> 01:54:42.464]  9-1-1, after a decade, have we learned anything?
[01:54:42.504 --> 01:54:45.368]  We'll talk about the anniversary coming up, then we'll shift gears.
[01:54:46.369 --> 01:54:47.110]  Into the economy.
[01:54:47.610 --> 01:54:58.656]  In the meantime, I'm going to take some of your phone calls that I've been holding and get into this earthquake news where the mainstream media and the USGS admits the government, private institutions can trigger earthquakes.
[01:54:59.196 --> 01:54:59.716]  Really?
[01:54:59.736 --> 01:55:09.542]  Oh, so Secretary of Defense Cohen was being truthful in 1997 when he gave a press conference and it was in the Army Times that our government and other governments can trigger earthquakes.
[01:55:10.062 --> 01:55:10.282]  Really?
[01:55:10.342 --> 01:55:11.643]  I've got documents they could do it in the 50s.
[01:55:11.923 --> 01:55:12.143]  The 50s.
[01:55:15.009 --> 01:55:19.274]  Okay, going back though, they even had geologists working on it in World War II.
[01:55:19.294 --> 01:55:22.578]  They're thinking about using a tsunami bomb on Japan.
[01:55:22.598 --> 01:55:24.340]  Oh yeah, that's the 40s.
[01:55:25.141 --> 01:55:26.823]  So that is coming up.
[01:55:27.103 --> 01:55:32.790]  Also, we have an article, and really it was going to be an open letter, but it turned into an article.
[01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:34.072]  We're going back to Nomi here in a moment.
[01:55:36.597 --> 01:55:38.298]  At Infowars.com.
[01:55:38.318 --> 01:55:40.339]  And it asks the question, is Apple evil?
[01:55:40.879 --> 01:55:42.540]  Now that Steve Jobs is leaving.
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.881]  And I'm probably shoot a video in the next few days.
[01:55:44.941 --> 01:55:46.461]  It's an open letter to Steve Jobs.
[01:55:47.402 --> 01:55:51.504]  Because I know a lot about Apple, a lot about Microsoft, a lot about Google.
[01:55:51.944 --> 01:55:56.206]  And let me tell you, it is not as trendy and liberal as they would have you believe.
[01:55:56.906 --> 01:55:59.330]  It's a big part of the conditioning of the population.
[01:55:59.350 --> 01:56:01.733]  So the articles up there is Apple evil.
[01:56:02.094 --> 01:56:05.278]  Going back to Nomi Prins, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs.
[01:56:05.719 --> 01:56:07.081]  Something's got to give Nomi.
[01:56:07.682 --> 01:56:11.187]  Just in your gut or in your political savvy.
[01:56:12.448 --> 01:56:13.949]  Do you think they're going to get away with this?
[01:56:14.009 --> 01:56:27.595]  I mean, sure, they've got the military, the government, the so-called mainstream media, but at a certain point, is the system at large just going to let a handful of banking families completely wreck the entire global economy?
[01:56:29.505 --> 01:56:31.866]  The optimistic side of me wants to say no.
[01:56:32.566 --> 01:56:58.791]  But the problem is that to get to a point where we are so wrecked because of this, that there is absolutely no alternative but to slap these banks back, to let the ones fail that need to fail, to break up the speculative aspects of them to the ones that actually deal with real people and real mortgages and real small business loans and actually create productive capital to grow this country, I think we're not at that point
[01:56:58.871 --> 01:56:58.971]  Yeah.
[01:57:29.011 --> 01:57:29.271]  I don't
[01:57:47.922 --> 01:57:57.430]  Invested with their own money, invested with their philosophies, invested with who they do business for and how, but I don't see that changing anytime in the near future.
[01:57:57.690 --> 01:58:04.095]  And going back to Bank of America and Buffett, again Buffett was the guy who invested also in Goldman and today in Bank of America,
[01:58:04.455 --> 01:58:18.961]  One of the other things that happened today in Bank of America is that the one Attorney General who was looking into all the fraud that was committed with respect to foreclosures and robo-signing and everything else that not just hurts people facing foreclosure, but anyone who's trying to sell a house.
[01:58:18.981 --> 01:58:28.005]  This documentation stuff isn't even just about foreclosures, but all the stuff banks have lost and defrauded people of has just gotten removed from dealing with settling the case.
[01:58:28.025 --> 01:58:33.688]  So those kind of signs show me that this is still unfortunately going on and getting worse.
[01:58:33.888 --> 01:58:34.389]  That's right.
[01:58:34.429 --> 01:58:37.232]  Anybody that tries to oppose these people gets destroyed.
[01:58:37.252 --> 01:58:39.195]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:41.878 --> 01:58:43.400]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:51.491]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:51.511 --> 01:58:58.196]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.457 --> 01:59:00.758]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.019 --> 01:59:06.203]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.383 --> 01:59:09.165]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:09.445 --> 01:59:11.487]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:11.747 --> 01:59:17.670]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:21.191]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.371 --> 01:59:26.894]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.154 --> 01:59:28.454]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:28.795 --> 01:59:29.955]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.095 --> 01:59:32.636]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:32.756 --> 01:59:34.177]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:59:34.457 --> 01:59:36.819]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:59:36.979 --> 01:59:41.482]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:41.602 --> 01:59:44.043]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[01:59:44.183 --> 01:59:47.906]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:48.066 --> 01:59:49.807]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:59:53.249 --> 01:59:55.191]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.671 --> 01:59:58.453]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.031 --> 02:00:09.214]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.854 --> 02:00:10.654]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.455 --> 02:00:12.375]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.996 --> 02:00:16.818]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.178 --> 02:00:21.241]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.897 --> 02:00:28.021]  All right, finishing up with former managing director at Goldman Sachs, Nomi Prince.
[02:00:29.082 --> 02:00:39.352]  Nomi, you got a new book coming out in October talking about Black Tuesday and you're saying we could end up having one of those by October, but you were finishing up by saying we need to stand behind
[02:00:40.092 --> 02:00:45.757]  Uh, investigators at state and federal level that do try to go up against the incredibly arrogant creatures.
[02:00:46.137 --> 02:00:52.162]  I mean, we've seen a couple years ago on Laird NewsHour, uh, Greenspan say, we're above the law.
[02:00:52.522 --> 02:00:54.003]  Government has no jurisdiction.
[02:00:54.043 --> 02:00:54.984]  We can do whatever we want.
[02:00:55.264 --> 02:00:57.506]  We're our own branch of government when they're not government.
[02:00:58.146 --> 02:01:01.129]  Uh, we've seen, uh, Bernanke say gold is not money.
[02:01:01.749 --> 02:01:04.291]  Uh, we've seen Bernanke say, I won't tell you where the trillions went.
[02:01:04.331 --> 02:01:07.373]  Some of it to him, him himself, just like with, uh, Paulson.
[02:01:08.824 --> 02:01:14.048]  Uh, we've seen on top of that, uh, Bern, uh, Bernanke say, we'll just print money.
[02:01:14.088 --> 02:01:18.131]  We've seen Greenspan go on Meet the Press and say, we won't default, we'll just print money.
[02:01:18.651 --> 02:01:24.095]  And that's why even Goolsbee, you know, big skull and bones Obama globalist, started, turned red.
[02:01:24.115 --> 02:01:29.940]  He actually blushed and smiled and looked like he was about to cough or spit something up because it was so outrageous.
[02:01:30.820 --> 02:01:37.568]  They're telling the Chinese, we're not going to hyperinflate, we're not going to hyperinflate, they are hyperinflating, and here he is just arrogantly saying it.
[02:01:37.608 --> 02:01:41.453]  I mean, these guys, these guys act like they are God.
[02:01:41.513 --> 02:01:49.743]  I mean, they just waddle around, a bunch of chicken-neck, corrupt old men, ruining our dollar, ruining our future, and I've had enough of them!
[02:01:51.657 --> 02:02:16.450]  And we all, I think we all have, and that's why I, you know, as we were saying before the debate, I think everyone, you know, listening to Joe, everyone out there who is looking for information and wherever it comes from, you know, whoever is providing the truth, you know, whether they call themselves in a certain party but they're different from their party, whether they're individuals, whether they're attorney generals who are like out there relative to like the other 49 that are basically
[02:02:16.910 --> 02:02:17.230]  I don't
[02:02:37.841 --> 02:02:38.201]  We're good.
[02:02:54.053 --> 02:02:58.937]  They are only floating the financial system in the corrupt manners in which it operates.
[02:02:59.017 --> 02:03:02.760]  And that is something that has to stop for all of our goods.
[02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:11.366]  And so I just continue to feel that the people who are out there talking about this stuff, bringing up these issues, really should be listened to.
[02:03:11.667 --> 02:03:19.433]  Agree or not agree, at least examine what they're saying and realize that there are alternative opinions on any spectrum, in any belief, that are at least showing
[02:03:20.774 --> 02:03:28.121]  The corruption that's in the financial system and the devastation that it does for most of the general people in the country and in the world.
[02:03:28.741 --> 02:03:30.783]  And that that has to change and that has to stop.
[02:03:30.843 --> 02:03:41.113]  And we, unfortunately, have to be the voices from the ground up because the voices in Washington and the voices, the people that are running the show, don't care.
[02:03:42.455 --> 02:03:45.058]  Well, that's the truth, and then some.
[02:03:45.098 --> 02:03:50.243]  They actually love wrecking society, love consolidating it, and think their police state's gonna save them.
[02:03:50.263 --> 02:03:53.026]  They can just blow something up, say terrorists did it.
[02:03:53.707 --> 02:03:58.452]  Everybody grandstand around them and say, oh, please save me, Bernanke, from the terrorists.
[02:03:59.053 --> 02:04:01.815]  It's truly disgusting how transparent they are when you're aware of them.
[02:04:02.156 --> 02:04:04.178]  Nomi Prince, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:04:04.198 --> 02:04:04.959]  Thank you.
[02:04:05.922 --> 02:04:10.683]  All right, we're going to come back and, because I've got a lot of news, I've got to get to Is Apple Evil?
[02:04:11.123 --> 02:04:14.284]  I've got to get to the earthquake news where they're admitting it can be man-made.
[02:04:14.804 --> 02:04:18.725]  I've got to get to Ron Paul is in the top tier.
[02:04:18.765 --> 02:04:21.086]  More big polls out showing he is in the top three.
[02:04:21.106 --> 02:04:25.947]  Important article to get out by Steve Watson that's at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:04:26.867 --> 02:04:27.468]  We've also
[02:04:28.948 --> 02:04:31.810]  Got some other Qaddafi news I want to get to and some other economic news.
[02:04:32.251 --> 02:04:34.573]  So much, it starts breaking by the third hour every day.
[02:04:34.653 --> 02:04:39.237]  And Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is going to be joining us via video Skype coming up.
[02:04:40.157 --> 02:04:41.218]  So stay with us for that.
[02:04:41.639 --> 02:04:43.680]  And then tonight, 7 p.m.
[02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:44.641]  Central, 8 p.m.
[02:04:44.681 --> 02:04:52.588]  Eastern, we're going to have a special report with field reporters and so much more.
[02:04:53.934 --> 02:04:55.299]  On a host of key issues.
[02:04:56.022 --> 02:04:59.354]  And I may tag my special message on to Steve Jobs then.
[02:05:00.424 --> 02:05:03.765]  Hi folks, Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.
[02:05:03.945 --> 02:05:09.006]  In August, we're celebrating our 30-year anniversary in the long-term food supply industry.

[02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:30.070]  If you ever thought about getting a year's supply of food, now is the time.

[02:05:36.192 --> 02:05:38.113]  You know you need your own food.
[02:05:38.273 --> 02:05:39.433]  But time is running out.

[02:06:00.199 --> 02:06:04.422]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:04.742 --> 02:06:05.022]  Number 1.
[02:06:05.662 --> 02:06:08.804]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:09.085 --> 02:06:09.645]  Number 2.
[02:06:09.945 --> 02:06:14.488]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:14.828 --> 02:06:15.289]  It's true.
[02:06:15.589 --> 02:06:20.132]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:20.452 --> 02:06:20.992]  Number 3.
[02:06:21.272 --> 02:06:24.554]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:24.855 --> 02:06:28.557]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:28.757 --> 02:06:29.318]  Number 4.
[02:06:29.558 --> 02:06:31.921]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:32.321 --> 02:06:35.705]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.005 --> 02:06:36.546]  Number 5.
[02:06:36.806 --> 02:06:40.710]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:40.951 --> 02:06:45.716]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:07:01.075 --> 02:07:02.557]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.777 --> 02:07:07.803]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:07:08.083 --> 02:07:09.445]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:09.625 --> 02:07:18.415]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:19.136 --> 02:07:26.239]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:07:26.679 --> 02:07:34.283]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:34.683 --> 02:07:39.605]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:07:39.905 --> 02:07:42.066]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:08:00.494 --> 02:08:05.576]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:05.916 --> 02:08:08.197]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:19.261 --> 02:08:21.863]  We'll race through five, six of your calls right now.
[02:08:22.623 --> 02:08:27.407]  And then I'm getting into the man-made earthquake news that's even in the New York Times.
[02:08:28.548 --> 02:08:33.091]  We're going to get into Is Apple Evil?
[02:08:33.191 --> 02:08:38.054]  article that we just launched at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com that is very important.
[02:08:38.515 --> 02:08:41.997]  Don't forget tonight, 7 o'clock, a special report.
[02:08:42.518 --> 02:08:44.319]  How is that different than a newscast?
[02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:49.841]  A newscast is 30 minutes every weeknight starting September 1st.
[02:08:50.341 --> 02:08:56.967]  A lot of nights, though, there's going to be a special report that's an extended interview or report or a documentary.
[02:08:56.987 --> 02:09:03.953]  We're going to be premiering documentaries we've been quietly working on in the next few months live on the show.
[02:09:04.734 --> 02:09:11.640]  And the real reason we're doing it is we need to have our own media system, force ourselves to boil information down so it can be even more effective.
[02:09:12.582 --> 02:09:15.651]  ...than just a long-form radio show that's also extremely effective.
[02:09:16.112 --> 02:09:18.680]  It's effective in a different way, and I've had...
[02:09:19.892 --> 02:09:20.593]  Here's an example.
[02:09:21.173 --> 02:09:28.339]  A year ago, and then again six months ago, and then a month ago, I've had a Sky Television channel in England, potentially reaching, you know, millions a month.
[02:09:28.679 --> 02:09:39.408]  That one channel, hundreds of thousands a day, is the viewers that channel has, and they said, we want you to edit your TV show every day, because this radio show is also slash a TV show.
[02:09:39.428 --> 02:09:42.170]  I'm sitting here videotaping, and it's not just a webcam.
[02:09:42.530 --> 02:09:45.193]  There's five cameras shooting here with video clips and everything else.
[02:09:45.653 --> 02:09:46.614]  They said, we'd like to air that.
[02:09:47.045 --> 02:09:49.747]  And I said, you can edit pieces of it and put it on if you want.
[02:09:50.147 --> 02:09:51.488]  I know some channels do do that.
[02:09:51.988 --> 02:09:53.829]  But I don't have the time, the energy, the money.
[02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:59.172]  I said, but I am planning my own weekday news show.
[02:09:59.932 --> 02:10:00.793]  And so that's what it is.
[02:10:00.913 --> 02:10:02.534]  And it's going to be good up front.
[02:10:02.834 --> 02:10:04.095]  You've seen these special reports.
[02:10:04.115 --> 02:10:05.396]  They're similar to what it's going to be like.
[02:10:05.416 --> 02:10:06.816]  And they're just going to get better and better.
[02:10:07.237 --> 02:10:12.440]  And we've really been working hard here, putting a lot of work, a lot of investment, a lot of time, a lot of money.
[02:10:13.513 --> 02:10:17.436]  And so, if you want to support us, become a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[02:10:17.716 --> 02:10:18.456]  You'll get it first.
[02:10:18.476 --> 02:10:21.838]  You'll get it exclusively until it goes on television.
[02:10:21.878 --> 02:10:26.001]  But still, that's going to be spotty on this channel or that channel.
[02:10:26.021 --> 02:10:30.103]  We're going to be relegated to, you know, channel 1,000 or whatever.
[02:10:30.444 --> 02:10:32.905]  But still, get on a lot of channels around the world.
[02:10:33.626 --> 02:10:34.766]  It starts reaching some people.
[02:10:35.207 --> 02:10:37.128]  So it's just another venue, another outlet.
[02:10:37.168 --> 02:10:38.669]  Really, it's just news for the Internet.
[02:10:39.931 --> 02:10:45.814]  And we couldn't have done any of it without you, and we're going to cover and tackle the big topics, not just the latest news.
[02:10:47.074 --> 02:10:48.174]  It's going to be power-packed.
[02:10:48.535 --> 02:10:50.555]  So PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:10:51.096 --> 02:10:54.877]  If you're not a member or you were a member and aren't anymore, we've added a lot of new features.
[02:10:54.957 --> 02:10:57.178]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:10:57.998 --> 02:11:02.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason, who's been holding the longest.
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:05.761]  Let's talk to John in Maryland.
[02:11:05.822 --> 02:11:06.622]  John, you're on the air.
[02:11:07.642 --> 02:11:09.304]  Hi, yeah, hi Alex.
[02:11:09.544 --> 02:11:16.072]  I hope to God I'm wrong about this, but I may know where and when the next false flag terrorist attack is going to take place.
[02:11:16.793 --> 02:11:23.842]  On September 2nd through 4th, Baltimore City is going to host its first ever IndyCar Grand Prix race.
[02:11:24.377 --> 02:11:24.597]  I think?
[02:11:43.294 --> 02:11:44.736]  Shareholders target themselves.
[02:11:45.237 --> 02:11:47.319]  They will try to target kids.
[02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:50.102]  And there's not usually children at the Federal Reserve Building.
[02:11:50.143 --> 02:11:54.708]  So look for the bombs to be in the daycare area, just like Oklahoma City.
[02:11:55.389 --> 02:11:57.271]  They really like to kill kids.
[02:11:57.832 --> 02:11:59.494]  And so I've analyzed their attack pattern.
[02:11:59.514 --> 02:12:02.357]  I said you're going to have riots, shootings, bombings.
[02:12:03.559 --> 02:12:11.325]  And more and more of the system will target itself, but they'll also have riots to target the general public, so the public comes running to the system to take their rights.
[02:12:11.365 --> 02:12:11.866]  But you know what?
[02:12:11.966 --> 02:12:13.147]  I hope that's not the case.
[02:12:13.527 --> 02:12:14.968]  Please don't give them any ideas.
[02:12:15.909 --> 02:12:24.136]  Colin Powell, of all people, is going to be the grand marshal of this race, so he would be there to shape the narrative.
[02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.958]  And grandstand, absolutely.
[02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:26.958]  Oh, that is.
[02:12:27.319 --> 02:12:28.480]  Oh, any other little chiblets?
[02:12:29.393 --> 02:12:35.777]  Well, they've got special areas specifically designated for children under 12 years of age and younger.
[02:12:36.278 --> 02:12:38.639]  One is called the Family Fun Zone.
[02:12:38.679 --> 02:12:40.921]  Please look at this online because it's really spooky.
[02:12:41.261 --> 02:12:43.383]  The other is called the Interactive Racing Zone.
[02:12:43.943 --> 02:12:51.608]  It's going to be full of go-kart racing, remote control, car racing, rides, games, people dressed up like giant Hershey Kisses.
[02:12:52.309 --> 02:12:59.053]  I keyed on this because I was listening to what you were saying last week, that it's going to be something like a daycare in a Federal Reserve building.
[02:13:00.634 --> 02:13:03.835]  Well, I mean, I get inside their head, and that's the kind of sick stuff they do.
[02:13:03.855 --> 02:13:09.218]  I mean, they follow that, because then they'll have, again, camera people waiting when the firemen have got a bloody kid.
[02:13:09.518 --> 02:13:11.199]  But let's not say it's going to happen there.
[02:13:11.239 --> 02:13:12.680]  We don't have any proof, any evidence.
[02:13:13.020 --> 02:13:16.682]  There's a lot of other permutations of events where they could do something similar.
[02:13:17.242 --> 02:13:22.744]  I just look at all the White House memos and advisers saying, we need a terror attack.
[02:13:22.805 --> 02:13:23.865]  Boy, it would sure help us.
[02:13:24.205 --> 02:13:27.447]  I mean, they operate out in the open like we're morons.
[02:13:28.047 --> 02:13:36.334]  And so to get the banks to look like victims, this is something that's in the constellation of events they could stage.
[02:13:37.374 --> 02:13:42.598]  But they could just bomb a federal building and then say the guy that did it didn't like the Federal Reserve.
[02:13:42.658 --> 02:13:45.160]  I mean, there's a lot of different things they can do.
[02:13:46.301 --> 02:13:55.428]  It's just if you're like Jane Graham, who we've interviewed many times, who was the head of HUD there in the building, and she saw McVeigh and other feds planting plastic explosives.
[02:13:55.448 --> 02:13:59.191]  She thought they were gray sticks of butter used by the telephone company.
[02:13:59.531 --> 02:14:01.033]  She was told we're the telephone company.
[02:14:01.533 --> 02:14:02.394]  You know, the day before.
[02:14:02.414 --> 02:14:07.120]  And it's just, if you ever see something like that, if you see something, say something.
[02:14:07.420 --> 02:14:12.065]  The problem is, if you report the feds about to bomb themselves, they're not going to stop it.
[02:14:12.406 --> 02:14:15.449]  So the only thing you can do is do a YouTube video or something.
[02:14:15.850 --> 02:14:16.791]  Because that's the problem.
[02:14:17.051 --> 02:14:17.271]  Hi Alex.
[02:14:46.579 --> 02:14:50.521]  Okay, I'm a first-time caller and new member of Planet TV.
[02:14:51.121 --> 02:14:52.482]  I have two questions and a comment.
[02:14:53.082 --> 02:15:05.168]  Do you think with all this shenanigans going on with Obama, the body of Obama, do you think that he would dare declare martial law to stop the presidential election in 2012?
[02:15:05.909 --> 02:15:08.110]  I don't know.
[02:15:08.130 --> 02:15:10.471]  I mean, the globalist
[02:15:11.843 --> 02:15:21.132]  Could simply remove him and put a new puppet in like Rick Perry, and then Rick Perry will get demonized and attacked in the narrative, and then they'll put another puppet in.
[02:15:21.152 --> 02:15:26.937]  I mean, Obama, I said, in Obama Deception, in fact, we ought to re-air the first ten minutes of Obama Deception.
[02:15:27.477 --> 02:15:31.921]  I said, he will plunge, he will be destroyed, he will be like toilet paper.
[02:15:32.061 --> 02:15:32.882]  Use toilet paper.
[02:15:33.583 --> 02:15:34.344]  Absolutely
[02:15:35.686 --> 02:15:36.708]  ...political garbage.
[02:15:37.168 --> 02:15:38.450]  But that's how it works.
[02:15:38.871 --> 02:15:42.536]  The office of the presidency already operates as a dictatorship.
[02:15:42.977 --> 02:15:44.619]  Wars without congressional approval...
[02:15:46.055 --> 02:15:48.096]  Carbon taxes without congressional approval.
[02:15:48.977 --> 02:15:50.598]  Selective enforcement of laws.
[02:15:51.619 --> 02:15:53.120]  Gun control without laws.
[02:15:55.501 --> 02:15:56.002]  Amnesty.
[02:15:56.022 --> 02:16:00.625]  They're saying, well, the 300,000 illegals, we'll just go ahead and release most of them out of prison.
[02:16:01.165 --> 02:16:06.369]  And we might keep a few of the felons back, but most of them we're just going to release on the streets of America.
[02:16:06.669 --> 02:16:07.589]  We're not going to deport them.
[02:16:07.749 --> 02:16:09.651]  Well, that violates federal immigration law.
[02:16:10.416 --> 02:16:17.019]  So, he's already a dictator, but he's a power slave, just like George W. Bush was.
[02:16:17.379 --> 02:16:23.361]  He's got all this power, but he's like a switch that a trillion watts is running through.
[02:16:23.621 --> 02:16:24.762]  He's still just a switch.
[02:16:25.182 --> 02:16:26.062]  He's not the power.
[02:16:26.702 --> 02:16:28.743]  He's like a power line carrying the power.
[02:16:29.023 --> 02:16:30.584]  He's not the electricity itself.
[02:16:31.224 --> 02:16:34.946]  He's a front man who's meant to be built up and then destroyed.
[02:16:36.046 --> 02:16:37.807]  Instead of Obama canceling election,
[02:16:38.883 --> 02:16:42.746]  I've said many times in the constellation of things I see them.
[02:16:42.766 --> 02:16:44.427]  I mean, I know their hand of cards.
[02:16:44.827 --> 02:16:45.307]  I know them.
[02:16:46.128 --> 02:16:48.149]  Eat, drink and sleep the globalist operation.
[02:16:49.110 --> 02:16:49.630]  Tracking it.
[02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:54.033]  So I'm inside the operation because I'm tracking it, I'm watching it, I'm looking through their eyes.
[02:16:54.433 --> 02:17:05.521]  And in their fist of cards, in their little hand, in their grimy little hands, is the assassination of Obama to be blamed on a patriot.
[02:17:06.445 --> 02:17:08.806]  Or what the establishment calls a paltard.
[02:17:09.526 --> 02:17:11.166]  And so that's in their grimy fist.
[02:17:11.206 --> 02:17:13.287]  And let me tell you, that can happen.
[02:17:14.728 --> 02:17:15.848]  So that's in the cards.
[02:17:16.488 --> 02:17:19.609]  Staging a failed assassination attempt against Obama.
[02:17:19.869 --> 02:17:21.069]  That's really in the cards.
[02:17:22.650 --> 02:17:23.850]  Staging other events.
[02:17:24.010 --> 02:17:25.371]  I mean, it's all there, man.
[02:17:25.391 --> 02:17:26.111]  Does that answer your question?
[02:17:27.116 --> 02:17:32.020]  Yes, I keep having this recurring dream that I see Obama being walked out of the White House in handcuffs.
[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:33.621]  I hope that happens real soon.
[02:17:34.041 --> 02:17:41.947]  But my comment is that I know that you have inspired me and opened my eyes, so have Dr. Savage and Reverend Manning.
[02:17:42.748 --> 02:17:54.897]  And the other night, two nights ago, I was listening to Dr. Savage, and he's on, you know, he's trying to analyze people and he's pretty good at it, but he's got it in his head that Rick Perry
[02:17:55.418 --> 02:18:01.210]  He seems to be a great candidate to lead this country and turn it around.
[02:18:01.370 --> 02:18:03.315]  And I couldn't get through on the line.
[02:18:03.475 --> 02:18:04.377]  I wanted to warn him.
[02:18:04.947 --> 02:18:07.608]  And maybe you need to talk to him and pull his coattail.
[02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:15.712]  I've tried to talk to Michael Savage, and I was critical of him years ago when he was pushing a police state for the Muslims.
[02:18:16.512 --> 02:18:20.054]  Folks, it's going to be used against everybody, and it is now.
[02:18:20.814 --> 02:18:22.595]  He has talked about false flag terror.
[02:18:22.655 --> 02:18:25.436]  That really makes the respect level for him go up.
[02:18:28.004 --> 02:18:29.085]  He doesn't live in Austin.
[02:18:29.105 --> 02:18:30.166]  He doesn't know Rick Perry.
[02:18:30.186 --> 02:18:31.327]  But he'll get educated.
[02:18:31.867 --> 02:18:33.108]  Forced inoculations.
[02:18:34.029 --> 02:18:37.852]  Eminent domain power grabs for foreign companies of farms and ranches.
[02:18:39.013 --> 02:18:42.576]  I mean, to go over Rick Perry... But again, Rush Limbaugh.
[02:18:43.177 --> 02:18:43.737]  Ask him this.
[02:18:43.797 --> 02:18:45.539]  Hey, Savage, you're always attacking Limbaugh.
[02:18:46.792 --> 02:18:55.468]  And calling him an empty suit and a front man and all this stuff, well, I mean, this guy's being totally endorsed by Limbaugh.
[02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:59.375]  I mean, Rick Perry, ladies and gentlemen, is as phony as a $3 bill.
[02:19:00.802 --> 02:19:02.984]  I mean, the guy is an absolute joke.
[02:19:03.804 --> 02:19:06.566]  And just like people thought, oh, Obama, he's real, he'll save us.
[02:19:07.226 --> 02:19:09.148]  Oh, Rick Perry, he's going to save us.
[02:19:09.328 --> 02:19:09.668]  No!
[02:19:10.268 --> 02:19:15.732]  The only person who's real, and it doesn't mean he can save us, but he'll certainly get us in the right direction, is Ron Paul.
[02:19:16.112 --> 02:19:17.053]  I appreciate your call.
[02:19:17.093 --> 02:19:17.773]  Good to hear from you.
[02:19:18.794 --> 02:19:19.134]  All right.
[02:19:19.435 --> 02:19:21.136]  Those callers have been holding the longest.
[02:19:21.676 --> 02:19:25.479]  And I got Dr. Roberts coming up, and I've got to get to these other news items.
[02:19:25.499 --> 02:19:27.080]  So I'm going to come back into the earthquake.
[02:19:27.972 --> 02:19:31.217]  News mainstream media and government admitting earthquakes can be man-made.
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:36.225]  And I think I'm gonna have a special comment at the end of the news tonight.
[02:19:37.267 --> 02:19:41.513]  Really, tonight's special report format.
[02:19:42.808 --> 02:19:45.951]  Is really a kind of a beta test for the nightly news.
[02:19:46.151 --> 02:19:52.798]  There'll be some differences and we're gonna, the nightly news, we're gonna try different variants of what I end up thinking is most effective to get the word out.
[02:19:53.759 --> 02:19:57.442]  But again, seven o'clock tonight, seven o'clock, PrisonPlanet.TV
[02:20:00.623 --> 02:20:01.464]  Attention gardeners!
[02:20:01.524 --> 02:20:03.887]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:20:04.127 --> 02:20:08.451]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:20:08.651 --> 02:20:16.540]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:20:16.860 --> 02:20:19.681]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:20:19.961 --> 02:20:27.502]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:20:27.602 --> 02:20:33.183]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:20:33.423 --> 02:20:38.984]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:20:39.264 --> 02:20:42.505]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:20:42.805 --> 02:20:46.169]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:51.436]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:54.339]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:20:54.379 --> 02:20:54.559]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:21:00.091 --> 02:21:04.452]  If you drive for a living, you don't get paid to stop or wait in line.
[02:21:05.333 --> 02:21:07.493]  Keep your wheels moving with PrePass.
[02:21:07.913 --> 02:21:17.276]  Bypass way stations, fly by port of entry facilities, stay moving at highway speed, while the guy without PrePass waits in line.
[02:21:19.677 --> 02:21:21.417]  Save time, save money.
[02:21:21.658 --> 02:21:26.219]  Call 888-401-PASS to try PrePass free.
[02:21:26.619 --> 02:21:27.019]  That's 888-401-PASS.
[02:21:31.152 --> 02:21:34.314]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:21:34.534 --> 02:21:42.559]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:21:42.719 --> 02:21:47.863]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:21:48.043 --> 02:21:50.945]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.
[02:21:51.025 --> 02:21:53.806]  Visit us at crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:21:54.927 --> 02:21:55.708]  Don't forget.
[02:21:56.188 --> 02:21:59.210]  Crossbreedholsters.com.
[02:21:59.550 --> 02:22:03.572]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[02:22:03.992 --> 02:22:05.213]  Everyone can feel it.
[02:22:05.473 --> 02:22:13.938]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[02:22:14.378 --> 02:22:17.560]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising.
[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:18.701]  But take heart.
[02:22:18.721 --> 02:22:22.323]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[02:22:22.643 --> 02:22:27.707]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[02:22:28.047 --> 02:22:31.610]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[02:22:31.891 --> 02:22:33.352]  The globalists are scared.
[02:22:33.612 --> 02:22:34.633]  They've overreached.
[02:22:34.953 --> 02:22:38.096]  The future of the info war is in your hands.
[02:22:38.476 --> 02:22:40.477]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:44.080]  We're good.
[02:22:59.594 --> 02:23:05.978]  What you're about to hear are the real experiences of women over 40 who finally lost weight by becoming hormonally balanced again.
[02:23:05.998 --> 02:23:07.319]  I lost 20 pounds.
[02:23:07.439 --> 02:23:08.900]  I lost 40 pounds.
[02:23:09.141 --> 02:23:11.242]  I lost 55 pounds.
[02:23:11.402 --> 02:23:12.783]  I went from a size 14 to a size 8.
[02:23:14.306 --> 02:23:20.868]  Their secret is Amberin, the revolutionary formula for women over 40 that balances hormones naturally.
[02:23:21.188 --> 02:23:24.628]  The leading cause of weight gain over 40 is hormonal imbalance.
[02:23:24.829 --> 02:23:28.669]  Until you balance your hormones, losing weight can be practically impossible.
[02:23:28.909 --> 02:23:35.491]  But Amberin restores hormonal balance naturally, so the weight can just fall right off, even that stubborn belly fat.
[02:23:35.831 --> 02:23:43.673]  Plus, Amberin eliminates other symptoms of hormonal aging, like hot flashes, night sweats, low libido, difficulty concentrating, and more.

[02:23:50.295 --> 02:23:50.515]  Free.
[02:23:50.535 --> 02:23:50.715]  Call 1-800-737-9107.
[02:23:50.735 --> 02:23:50.935]  That's 1-800-737-9107.
[02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:51.015]  1-800-737-9107.
[02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:14.681]  Okay, it's official.
[02:24:15.161 --> 02:24:17.723]  Human activity can cause earthquakes.
[02:24:18.564 --> 02:24:26.049]  A great boil-down article, that's really what Washington Blog excels at, is linked up at InfoWars.com today.
[02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:27.451]  It's official.
[02:24:27.531 --> 02:24:29.952]  Human activity can cause earthquakes.
[02:24:29.992 --> 02:24:33.715]  Human activity is officially acknowledged to cause earthquakes.
[02:24:33.775 --> 02:24:35.456]  The United States Geological Survey
[02:24:36.477 --> 02:24:38.741]  ...is America's official expert on earthquakes.
[02:24:39.301 --> 02:24:47.693]  It's the federal agency charged with monitoring, reporting on, researching, and stressing preparedness for earthquakes.
[02:24:48.953 --> 02:24:53.137]  So I was surprised to read the following statement on the USGS.
[02:24:53.238 --> 02:24:56.441]  And again, this was reported the last few days by the Denver Post as well.
[02:24:57.122 --> 02:24:58.984]  That's why we covered it the day of the quake.
[02:24:59.384 --> 02:25:06.091]  Earthquakes induced by human activity have been documented in a few locations in the United States, Japan, and Canada.
[02:25:06.852 --> 02:25:17.304]  The cause was injection of fluids into deep wells for waste disposal and secondary recovery of oil, fracking, and the use of reservoirs for water supplies.
[02:25:17.825 --> 02:25:19.507]  Most of these earthquakes were minor.
[02:25:19.907 --> 02:25:26.415]  The largest and most widely known resulted from fluid injection at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal near Denver, Colorado.
[02:25:27.443 --> 02:25:33.546]  In 1967, an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 followed a series of smaller earthquakes.
[02:25:34.007 --> 02:25:44.992]  Injection had been discounted at the site in previous years once the link between the fluid injection and the earlier series of earthquakes was established.
[02:25:45.012 --> 02:25:47.914]  So they discontinued it once they confirmed it was happening.
[02:25:48.394 --> 02:25:50.316]  Nicholas Craig and Weston R.L.
[02:25:50.777 --> 02:25:56.223]  1990, Earthquake Hazard Associated with Deep Well Injection, a report to the U.S.
[02:25:56.283 --> 02:25:58.445]  Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.
[02:25:58.465 --> 02:26:00.828]  Geological Survey, Bulletin, 1951, page 74.
[02:26:03.991 --> 02:26:05.532]  And again, I should do a report on this.
[02:26:05.552 --> 02:26:09.334]  This is the type of thing I'll do on the nightly news.
[02:26:09.834 --> 02:26:11.395]  Little nuggets of info.
[02:26:11.475 --> 02:26:16.678]  I'll go pull the Israeli companies bragging that they can inject explosives and cause big earthquakes.
[02:26:17.218 --> 02:26:19.260]  Or I can pull up the Russians admitting they can do it.
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.222]  I can pull up the tsunami bomb from the 1950s out of the Australian newspapers.
[02:26:24.863 --> 02:26:30.446]  I can pull up then the Eastman HAARP
[02:26:33.083 --> 02:26:41.965]  Patent where they admit using these systems to oscillate the atmosphere and bounce back to the earth and just then tag it all off.
[02:26:43.399 --> 02:26:51.065]  With the Secretary of Defense William Cohen, 1997, April 28, saying, yes, we can create earthquakes and other governments can as well.
[02:26:51.725 --> 02:27:06.397]  Continues the New York Times noted in February, researchers with the Arkansas Geological Survey say that while there is no discernible link between earthquake and gas production, there is strong temporal and spatial evidence for relationship between these quakes and the injection wells.
[02:27:07.725 --> 02:27:16.409]  So they may just try to use these tremors caused by shifting what's going on under the ground with gas and oil wells to restrict everybody.
[02:27:16.449 --> 02:27:19.450]  Say, that'll be another thing to keep us from developing our own oil.
[02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:24.232]  For decades, scientists have been researching induced
[02:27:25.692 --> 02:27:29.553]  Seismicity, or how human activity can cause earthquakes.
[02:27:30.233 --> 02:27:30.873]  And it goes on.
[02:27:30.913 --> 02:27:35.834]  There's a Lawrence Berkeley laboratory points out that ever since the 1930s this had been observed.
[02:27:36.394 --> 02:27:41.115]  And then it goes through the different maps of water injection and fracking.
[02:27:41.156 --> 02:27:45.797]  We'll show folks a document cam shot of that if they're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:27:45.837 --> 02:27:47.657]  But again, you can go read this article.
[02:27:48.637 --> 02:27:50.598]  It's pretty pretty darned
[02:27:52.578 --> 02:28:00.025]  Detailed, and you can see it there on the site.
[02:28:00.065 --> 02:28:02.968]  But again, we'll be covering that more.
[02:28:03.088 --> 02:28:07.872]  Now, this is just a mild, mild admission.
[02:28:07.912 --> 02:28:09.453]  The point is, this stuff does exist.
[02:28:09.493 --> 02:28:10.194]  It can happen.
[02:28:10.654 --> 02:28:17.481]  And I saw reports in the Washington Post, Associated Press, and others in the last few days saying, well, this is a very rare earthquake.
[02:28:18.464 --> 02:28:21.409]  That is hit Virginia and surrounding states.
[02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:25.997]  Then they had aftershocks, a 4.5 magnitude aftershock.
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:29.583]  Now more cracks found at the Washington Monument.
[02:28:31.587 --> 02:28:38.714]  It's probably a natural earthquake, but if it continues or more happens and we continue to see major population centers hit, that's the thing.
[02:28:38.774 --> 02:28:45.160]  So many of these big quakes now are hitting major population centers, where before it hit a major center and then out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:50.385]  Then it hit another major population center and then out in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle of nowhere.
[02:28:50.725 --> 02:28:52.206]  Then it hit a major population center.
[02:28:52.647 --> 02:28:55.069]  Now it's population center, population center.
[02:28:55.089 --> 02:28:55.570]  I was looking at
[02:28:56.070 --> 02:29:04.036]  Analysts breaking this down the last few years that so many of the big quakes now are right there in key areas, right there in major population centers.
[02:29:04.817 --> 02:29:10.681]  And a lot of that's because people do tend to build on coastlines that tend to be along tectonic fault lines.
[02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:13.684]  So, you know, you don't want to get caught up in the same thing.
[02:29:14.867 --> 02:29:18.529]  Like they do with Al Gore, when there's a hot day, it's global warming.
[02:29:18.569 --> 02:29:20.470]  When it's a cold day, it's global warming.
[02:29:20.510 --> 02:29:26.434]  Because there's thousands of micro-climates around the world, and there's always going to be extreme weather happening somewhere.
[02:29:27.414 --> 02:29:29.736]  I mean, we know 150 years ago there was a drought in Texas.
[02:29:30.606 --> 02:29:31.767]  In the fifties there was a drought.
[02:29:31.807 --> 02:29:32.608]  There's a drought now.
[02:29:33.649 --> 02:29:37.232]  And there's a reason a lot of Texas looks like the desert.
[02:29:37.792 --> 02:29:44.839]  It's not like, it's the jungle and suddenly we've got a drought from central Texas down to the west.
[02:29:45.359 --> 02:29:46.960]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts coming up.
[02:29:46.980 --> 02:29:47.461]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.764 --> 02:29:51.645]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.145 --> 02:29:53.766]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.687 --> 02:29:57.370]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.494 --> 02:30:05.415]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:05.755 --> 02:30:09.278]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:09.318 --> 02:30:11.900]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:17.384]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:17.804 --> 02:30:24.069]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:30.034]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:30.454 --> 02:30:34.117]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:30:34.597 --> 02:30:38.581]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:38.901 --> 02:30:44.406]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:44.847 --> 02:30:47.830]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:49.812]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:50.372 --> 02:30:50.853]  It's here.

[02:31:00.305 --> 02:31:03.648]  Hi folks, Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg here for eFoods Direct.
[02:31:03.808 --> 02:31:08.893]  In August, we're celebrating our 30-year anniversary in the long-term food supply industry.
[02:31:09.133 --> 02:31:11.275]  To celebrate, the biggest sale ever.
[02:31:11.595 --> 02:31:14.398]  Our most popular premier one-year food supply for 30% off.
[02:31:15.839 --> 02:31:18.820]  That's 30% off of our Freedom Food Supply.

[02:32:12.316 --> 02:32:19.121]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:32:21.043 --> 02:32:23.344]  They sew pride in every stitch.

[02:32:29.397 --> 02:32:33.419]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:37.241]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[02:32:37.962 --> 02:32:38.782]  Others don't.
[02:32:39.202 --> 02:32:41.063]  We turn jeans inside out.

[02:32:57.712 --> 02:32:58.573]  Others don't.
[02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.831]  Big Brother.
[02:33:08.192 --> 02:33:09.753]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:10.974 --> 02:33:12.095]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:13.516 --> 02:33:14.536]  You want answers?
[02:33:15.477 --> 02:33:16.478]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:17.399 --> 02:33:23.703]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.021 --> 02:33:35.826]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, and last night we posted an article written by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:33:35.846 --> 02:33:40.469]  9-1-1, after a decade, have we learned anything?
[02:33:40.950 --> 02:33:49.676]  So we have him joining us via video Skype, if you happen to be a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer, and for all of our great radio listeners out there, I also want to get his take.
[02:33:50.792 --> 02:33:51.773]  All right.
[02:34:06.648 --> 02:34:11.611]  Austin Gouldsby of the Obama administration just double-taking and actually blushing.
[02:34:11.671 --> 02:34:20.037]  It was so, so incredible to hear that statement because that's obviously another form of default is to inflate and devalue the currency.
[02:34:20.677 --> 02:34:27.421]  But joining us to break down 9-1-1 after a decade is Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, best-selling author, former Wall Street Journal.
[02:34:28.442 --> 02:34:28.642]  Right.
[02:34:28.682 --> 02:34:29.243]  A decade later.
[02:34:43.919 --> 02:34:46.743]  Well, Alex, what I did, I just did a little reporting.
[02:34:46.843 --> 02:34:49.106]  I didn't express my opinion.
[02:34:50.287 --> 02:34:52.930]  And I asked the question, how well has the U.S.
[02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:56.895]  government's account held up over the decade?
[02:34:56.976 --> 02:34:59.899]  And it looks like not very well.
[02:35:02.142 --> 02:35:02.882]  A number of reasons.
[02:35:02.922 --> 02:35:30.787]  We've had the chairman and vice chairman and the senior legal counsel of the 9-11 Commission write books in which they say that the commission was set up to fail, that information was withheld, that Pentagon and FAA officials lied to them, that Bush and Cheney refused to testify under oath,
[02:35:32.808 --> 02:35:36.789]  And this didn't arouse any curiosity.
[02:35:36.829 --> 02:35:48.493]  People never wanted to know why the Pentagon would lie, or why the FAA would lie, or why information was withheld, or why the President was afraid to testify on the oath.
[02:35:49.787 --> 02:35:52.149]  None of this ever came up.
[02:35:52.229 --> 02:35:56.092]  It just sort of came out and dropped into the memory hole.
[02:35:56.792 --> 02:36:12.944]  And then, of course, we had had, prior to that, one of the Commission members, Max Cleland, had resigned from the Commission on the grounds that the constraints placed on it by the White House meant that the Commission was compromised.
[02:36:14.125 --> 02:36:16.387]  And so he simply resigned.
[02:36:19.545 --> 02:36:31.955]  And then, of course, we've had, now let me be clear, none of these people said or implied that they thought the U.S.
[02:36:31.995 --> 02:36:35.338]  government was involved in causing 9-11.
[02:36:38.015 --> 02:36:46.463]  The legal counsel and the chairman of the commission simply say that they don't know why the government lied to them.
[02:36:47.324 --> 02:36:50.006]  But the question is, why would the government lie?
[02:36:52.749 --> 02:36:58.294]  If it's lying to cover up its incompetence, that's one thing, but we at least should find out.
[02:36:58.334 --> 02:37:00.476]  But nobody bothered to find out.
[02:37:01.698 --> 02:37:14.647]  Then, the other thing that's happened that's sort of major is that a whole slew of 9-11 truth organizations have grown up.
[02:37:15.948 --> 02:37:26.315]  And it's fashionable in some circles to present these people as kooks, but they consist of 1,500 architects and engineers.
[02:37:29.485 --> 02:37:32.706]  Who put their professional reputation on the line.
[02:37:32.806 --> 02:37:39.269]  They consist of firefighters, including those present at the towers.
[02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:48.913]  They consist of pilots for 9-11 Truth, both commercial and military pilots.
[02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:51.754]  These organizations also include scholars.
[02:37:52.514 --> 02:37:56.276]  So there's all kinds of educated
[02:37:57.766 --> 02:38:05.432]  knowledgeable, professional people who have brought serious doubts about the explanation.
[02:38:06.773 --> 02:38:22.505]  And yet still, there's been no response from the government except for the one member of the Obama administration that proposed to infiltrate the 9-11 truth groups in order to discredit them.
[02:38:23.346 --> 02:38:29.990]  So, you know, why can't you discredit them publicly on the basis of the facts?
[02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:35.794]  No, Sunstein says infiltrate and then put out outrageous conspiracy theories to discredit all the rest.
[02:38:36.774 --> 02:38:39.556]  This was not invented by Obama.
[02:38:40.457 --> 02:38:42.318]  This has been going on for a very long time.
[02:38:42.978 --> 02:38:44.579]  But he's a member of the Obama administration.
[02:38:44.599 --> 02:38:44.980]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:51.684]  So, but you see, what should strike us is, why is it
[02:38:53.355 --> 02:39:02.265]  The administration, this is a successor administration, this is not the administration during whose term 9-11 happened.
[02:39:02.886 --> 02:39:10.073]  Why is it they feel they can't confront the architects and engineers and the pilots and the firefighters and the scholars?
[02:39:11.451 --> 02:39:13.092]  Publicly, with evidence!
[02:39:13.892 --> 02:39:20.476]  Why do they think that they have to infiltrate them and discredit them so repetitiously?
[02:39:21.416 --> 02:39:33.303]  You know, all these things raise questions, and to me, what the importance of this is, it shows that an amazing lack of inquisitiveness
[02:39:34.522 --> 02:39:43.046]  Not just on the part of the American people, but a part of the media, the Congress, the government itself, even the securities agencies.
[02:39:43.427 --> 02:39:45.148]  You would think the securities agencies.
[02:39:45.948 --> 02:39:52.671]  Doc, this is not a lack of curiosity like your cat there in the background.
[02:39:53.232 --> 02:39:55.413]  This is fear.
[02:39:55.693 --> 02:40:00.736]  People deep down know this is scary and I've talked to big reporters who are debunkers
[02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:09.133]  And I tell them, I say, I heard local CBS and ABC radio that day say they were going to blow up Building 7.
[02:40:09.513 --> 02:40:10.714]  I even have the tapes now.
[02:40:11.054 --> 02:40:12.795]  A cop saying, get back there, blowing it up.
[02:40:13.375 --> 02:40:15.716]  And I said, and now NIST has been proven wrong.
[02:40:15.736 --> 02:40:20.058]  They have to admit that there was free fall and their other five reasons didn't happen.
[02:40:20.538 --> 02:40:24.000]  And there was a NORAD stand down and the hijackers were trained at bases.
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:30.708]  And every one of the reporters says, I just can't believe the government is that evil.
[02:40:31.148 --> 02:40:39.779]  And we've seen liberal academics in the Toronto Star and other places say, even if it's true, it'll bring down the whole system so we can't go there.
[02:40:40.020 --> 02:40:43.003]  So at the end of the day, Dr. Roberts, these people are cowards.
[02:40:44.278 --> 02:40:55.002]  Well, that may be, but I just kind of raised this question in a very mild way.
[02:40:56.282 --> 02:41:09.367]  And I think that what we are faced with and what you're really saying is that facts are no match for emotions.
[02:41:11.093 --> 02:41:16.897]  And so when the facts threaten our emotions, we just sweep the facts under the rug.
[02:41:17.797 --> 02:41:21.840]  And it does look like that that is what's going on.
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:27.023]  But you see, the point that I make in here is that
[02:41:30.610 --> 02:41:35.831]  9-11 is the determinant event, the defining event of our time.
[02:41:36.632 --> 02:41:48.294]  And it's led to this decade of ever-expanding wars, to the economic deficits, the pending bankruptcy.
[02:41:48.895 --> 02:41:50.235]  It's led to a police state.
[02:41:52.279 --> 02:42:06.499]  You're aware that Justin Raimondo and Antiwar.com are being monitored by the FBI as possible threats to national security, working in behalf of a foreign power?
[02:42:08.037 --> 02:42:24.711]  We know the distinguished attorney Francis Boyle is placed on a terrorist watch list because he refused to violate the attorney-client privilege and spy on his clients for the FBI-CIA.
[02:42:25.771 --> 02:42:31.296]  These are all Gestapo operations, as you emphasized many times.
[02:42:32.722 --> 02:42:48.291]  And one would think that if the consequences of 9-11 is open-ended war and a police state and an economic bankruptcy, that this would be a bigger threat, a more fearful thing.
[02:42:49.429 --> 02:43:00.321]  And that this should drive some sort of demand for accountability as to what actually happened on 9-11.
[02:43:00.501 --> 02:43:10.032]  If we simply, the implication of the chairman and vice chairman and legal counsel's books are that the government
[02:43:10.912 --> 02:43:15.896]  I knew a lot more about the operation than it said.
[02:43:16.437 --> 02:43:28.747]  And what they seem to mean is that the various intelligence agencies were so much in competition with one another that they wouldn't share any information.
[02:43:28.847 --> 02:43:34.832]  And so even though they knew about these alleged Al Qaeda guys,
[02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:41.296]  Nobody would share his information with the other, and so they weren't able to put the picture together.
[02:43:42.057 --> 02:43:47.701]  That seems to be what the Commission doubters.
[02:43:48.162 --> 02:43:55.247]  We now have, you know, soon we'll have the 9-11 Commission for 9-11 Truth.
[02:44:04.031 --> 02:44:08.656]  Once you start looking into it, you know, it may be a can of worms.
[02:44:08.776 --> 02:44:12.419]  And so no one has looked into it.
[02:44:12.439 --> 02:44:13.320]  The media hasn't.
[02:44:14.261 --> 02:44:16.323]  And the Congress hasn't.
[02:44:16.603 --> 02:44:19.046]  And even if it did involve the U.S.
[02:44:19.086 --> 02:44:22.089]  government, it probably did not include the Congress.
[02:44:23.972 --> 02:44:26.694]  No one wants to take this on.
[02:44:26.754 --> 02:44:31.518]  In fact, I get hate mail from the right wing just for reporting on it.
[02:44:31.658 --> 02:44:36.281]  You know, I've never made any independent finding about 9-11.
[02:44:36.321 --> 02:44:41.525]  I've just simply reported what people are saying.
[02:44:42.285 --> 02:44:42.746]  Experts.
[02:44:42.986 --> 02:44:45.748]  And you've got this critical event that our entire
[02:44:47.156 --> 02:44:59.236]  Change in civilization, for the worse, is built on and you're not supposed to look at it and they want to infiltrate groups and destroy them from within if they dare talk about it because...
[02:45:00.370 --> 02:45:02.992]  It strikes at the heart of everything.
[02:45:03.532 --> 02:45:06.774]  If this comes out, it's going to bring these people down.
[02:45:07.114 --> 02:45:12.978]  But if it doesn't come out, it's going to lead them to Pax Americana that Dick Cheney wrote about.
[02:45:13.378 --> 02:45:20.182]  America is a global enforcer for these megabanks and this intercoterie of corporations.
[02:45:20.223 --> 02:45:23.004]  And if it ever comes out that these guys were U.S.
[02:45:23.024 --> 02:45:28.348]  government minions, which they were, taking part in drills, which they were, just like the underwear bomber,
[02:45:29.008 --> 02:45:30.229]  And we have the witnesses there.
[02:45:30.629 --> 02:45:33.411]  If it ever comes out, this will bring them down.
[02:45:33.471 --> 02:45:34.512]  So it's a double-edged sword.
[02:45:34.552 --> 02:45:35.873]  But look at Fast and Furious.
[02:45:37.294 --> 02:45:39.836]  Thousands of guns shipped into Mexico for two years.
[02:45:40.356 --> 02:45:43.218]  Over 3,000 dead confirmed connected to those guns alone.
[02:45:43.678 --> 02:45:46.140]  And the government knew and did it on purpose.
[02:45:46.700 --> 02:45:47.821]  And nobody gets in trouble.
[02:45:47.881 --> 02:45:50.203]  And it's admitted the Attorney General lied to Congress.
[02:45:52.113 --> 02:45:53.374]  Well, that's true.
[02:45:54.154 --> 02:45:56.515]  You can find so many of these examples now.
[02:45:59.457 --> 02:46:04.439]  So, it looks pretty dark, and I agree with you.
[02:46:05.400 --> 02:46:12.103]  The government is actually going to bring us down just from all its overreach.
[02:46:14.585 --> 02:46:18.947]  We are not capable of being a world hegemon.
[02:46:21.255 --> 02:46:26.177]  Areas of the world seeing what's happening and what we're doing is starting to organize against us.
[02:46:27.397 --> 02:46:32.078]  And once that happens, the power distribution changes.
[02:46:32.358 --> 02:46:43.262]  So what we really are facing is these people in Washington eventually resorting to nuclear weapons.
[02:46:44.785 --> 02:46:55.173]  And so this is, of course, a far greater threat than having to face the possibility that the government lied about 9-11.
[02:46:55.473 --> 02:46:56.274]  It'd be much better.
[02:46:57.299 --> 02:46:59.039]  You know how they'll do that, Dr. Roberts.
[02:46:59.079 --> 02:47:16.364]  They'll blow a city up, say that a Muslim country did it with Russian support, they'll track the isotope to Russia, and then they'll have a stalemate and say, totally capitulated, we're going to nuke you, we're an underground basis, we don't care about the general population, and Russia may roll over.
[02:47:16.784 --> 02:47:20.445]  Now these same globalists are somewhat teamed up with China, but whenever you look at
[02:47:21.145 --> 02:47:40.313]  And this is my next question, with bizarre statements like Greenspan saying we'll just print money and other things, and there was a certain doddering craziness in his eyes, and even the host of the show and even insider Goolsbee were clearly shocked by such a statement.
[02:47:40.713 --> 02:47:47.776]  And as an economist who understands these things, why do you think Goolsbee and the host were so shocked by the
[02:47:48.636 --> 02:47:55.031]  Almost nattering, giggling, child-like way Greenspan said it.
[02:47:55.984 --> 02:48:00.465]  Well, I don't know, but I think Greenspan is right.
[02:48:01.845 --> 02:48:11.988]  The United States government cannot default because its bonds are in its own currency and it can always redeem the bonds by printing money.
[02:48:12.688 --> 02:48:17.889]  So I do not think there's any possibility of defaulting on paying the bonds.
[02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:23.331]  Now, of course, if they print enough money to redeem enough bonds,
[02:48:24.532 --> 02:48:25.193]  I don't know.
[02:48:42.443 --> 02:48:45.965]  But before they would never talk like that, at least when I've seen them now.
[02:48:46.446 --> 02:48:49.487]  Now they're getting more and more out in the open and he just said it like it was.
[02:48:49.508 --> 02:48:51.209]  But Alex, it's what they're doing, isn't it?
[02:48:51.309 --> 02:48:53.750]  I mean, that's what Quantitative Easing 1 was.
[02:48:53.770 --> 02:48:56.512]  That's what Quantitative Easing 2 was.
[02:48:56.612 --> 02:49:03.316]  It was printing money to purchase the newly issued debt of the Treasury.
[02:49:03.536 --> 02:49:07.319]  Do you think they'll announce QE3 at that event with Bernanke tomorrow?
[02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:13.004]  I don't know whether they'll announce it, but I'm fairly confident they're going to do it.
[02:49:14.225 --> 02:49:21.173]  And whether they will decide if they announce it, it's more troublesome than not announcing it and just doing it.
[02:49:22.834 --> 02:49:25.337]  I don't know how they'll judge that.
[02:49:28.813 --> 02:49:33.296]  If they stop buying the bonds, you have to ask yourself, who's going to buy them?
[02:49:34.136 --> 02:49:41.741]  Now, if the stock market keeps tumbling and going down, then you'll have a lot of flight from stocks to bonds.
[02:49:41.821 --> 02:49:44.262]  And that will finance the deficit.
[02:49:44.863 --> 02:49:49.585]  As long as that flight goes on, there's a tremendous amount of money in the stock market that can exit.
[02:49:52.287 --> 02:50:04.250]  Or if the top is taking off gold and everybody starts saying, oh my gosh, it's going down, you may have a flight from gold in the bond.
[02:50:04.270 --> 02:50:07.031]  So different things like that can finance it.
[02:50:07.671 --> 02:50:14.633]  Or if they get the rumor established that the Euro is going to collapse because of sovereign debt problems, then you'll have all the flight from Europe.
[02:50:15.633 --> 02:50:17.114]  How long can the juggling last?
[02:50:35.196 --> 02:50:37.677]  That might take high inflation.
[02:50:38.598 --> 02:50:53.726]  Or it might just result from people saying, look, they can't get their deficit under control and they're going to continue to print money and we're holding all these huge numbers of bonds and we need to start getting out of it.
[02:50:53.966 --> 02:50:56.127]  Let's finish up with the endgame on the other side.
[02:50:56.187 --> 02:50:57.508]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:50:57.528 --> 02:50:58.048]  Stay with us.
[02:51:00.370 --> 02:51:03.412]  What nutrition are you missing that's leading to the four major diseases?
[02:51:03.752 --> 02:51:06.575]  Cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and Parkinson's.
[02:51:06.935 --> 02:51:22.406]  There are at least 80,000 medical studies that show a lack of the protein glutathione to be linked to cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, macular degeneration, lung disease, digestive diseases, diabetes, Alzheimer's, ALS, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus.
[02:51:22.926 --> 02:51:24.047]  In all, at least 68 diseases.
[02:51:25.208 --> 02:51:29.793]  What is the number one food by which your body is most empowered to increase its glutathione production?
[02:51:30.133 --> 02:51:33.036]  It is undamaged whey protein from grass-fed cows.
[02:51:33.597 --> 02:51:37.661]  One World Whey is truly the first undamaged whey protein powder on the market.
[02:51:38.242 --> 02:51:41.986]  All other whey proteins are damaged by heat, chemicals, and filtration.
[02:51:42.606 --> 02:51:47.430]  One World Whey is now the standard by which all other whey protein powders can be measured.
[02:51:47.851 --> 02:51:48.111]  Call 888-988-3325.
[02:51:48.131 --> 02:51:48.491]  That's 888-988-3325.

[02:54:11.237 --> 02:54:17.110]  We're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts about where does all this end?
[02:54:18.154 --> 02:54:21.736]  Because we're already living the horrible recession going into depression.
[02:54:21.756 --> 02:54:24.798]  We're already experiencing inflation and a lot of commodities.
[02:54:25.398 --> 02:54:30.882]  The dollar being devalued, QE1, QE3, is already causing increased inflation worldwide.
[02:54:30.902 --> 02:54:38.106]  But the banks are hoarding the bailout money, most of it, so it's not really causing the hardcore inflation.
[02:54:38.587 --> 02:54:40.588]  But we do see the Chinese lecturing us.
[02:54:41.548 --> 02:54:44.290]  We do see Putin saying America's a parasite.
[02:54:44.310 --> 02:54:46.812]  How about the parasites took over America?
[02:54:47.805 --> 02:54:54.669]  I mean, that's more like it, but I guess we are parasites at the end of the day if we let these parasites run us and control us.
[02:54:55.109 --> 02:55:05.555]  So, Dr. Roberts, am I right in your view that we're really starting to get closer to the point of where it's almost a foregone conclusion that the dollar is going to die?
[02:55:05.595 --> 02:55:07.496]  The unthinkable is now thinkable.
[02:55:07.536 --> 02:55:10.378]  The only question is, how will that transition happen?
[02:55:11.819 --> 02:55:12.639]  I think that's right.
[02:55:14.941 --> 02:55:23.828]  You know, the only way they can save the dollar, they would have to be able to greatly reduce the trade deficit.
[02:55:24.709 --> 02:55:27.931]  And they can't do that because of all the offshoring of jobs.
[02:55:29.132 --> 02:55:38.180]  And to get the budget deficit under control, they would have to be able to stop the wars and dramatically cut the defense budget.
[02:55:39.188 --> 02:55:49.820]  But the power of the military security complex is just too high, and the propaganda and terrorist scare has been effective for so much of the population.
[02:55:50.541 --> 02:55:59.071]  So if you can't get your trade deficit under control, and you can't get your budget deficit under control, there's no way the dollar can survive.
[02:56:00.646 --> 02:56:11.331]  Now, the train wreck can be slow and gradual, or just one day everybody could wake up and say, my God, what am I doing holding all these dollar-denominated assets?
[02:56:12.171 --> 02:56:13.152]  And it could be fast.
[02:56:13.372 --> 02:56:14.753]  I have no way of knowing.
[02:56:15.073 --> 02:56:16.513]  No one has any way of knowing.
[02:56:17.054 --> 02:56:24.157]  But I think it is true that they've got no way to control the budget deficit or the trade deficit.
[02:56:24.277 --> 02:56:26.378]  And therefore, there will be a train wreck.
[02:56:29.275 --> 02:56:33.658]  So just a few years ago you were saying that there were some things we could do to reverse this.
[02:56:34.258 --> 02:56:41.803]  Are you saying that this couldn't be reversed even if the right policies were put in place because we've just been too de-industrialized?
[02:56:42.323 --> 02:56:44.765]  If I was in charge I could reverse it still.
[02:56:45.984 --> 02:56:51.968]  But the powers that be will not let politicians reverse it.
[02:56:52.289 --> 02:56:59.194]  Offshoring benefits the corporations and shareholders because it increases profits.
[02:57:00.294 --> 02:57:08.761]  And so if you go in there and say, well, we're not going to let you increase your profits this way anymore, you're going to be up against the powerful financial interest.
[02:57:10.082 --> 02:57:22.630]  Similarly, if you say, okay, we've had enough of these wars, we can't afford them, they're undermining us, and so we're stopping the wars and we're cutting back defense, you'd be up against the military security complex.
[02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:30.356]  Yeah, they'll just send hitmen to kill a few people to scare Congress, or they'll blow up a new building and say, guys with turbines did it, everybody will fall down and worship them.
[02:57:32.137 --> 02:57:37.681]  Probably either of these private interest groups are stronger than the President.
[02:57:39.754 --> 02:57:54.859]  And unless the President had a movement behind him, which included the security agencies, you know, if the CIA and the FBI and all this are going to stand behind the President, then he could get away with it.
[02:57:54.999 --> 02:57:56.819]  Otherwise, he hasn't a chance.
[02:57:57.079 --> 02:57:58.200]  And there'd still be a war.
[02:58:00.447 --> 02:58:04.133]  These entrenched bureaucracies and corporate interests, they're not going away.
[02:58:04.153 --> 02:58:06.376]  They're not going to just give up, you're right.
[02:58:07.698 --> 02:58:10.683]  They would test the strength of the president.
[02:58:13.153 --> 02:58:16.934]  In my opinion, the way things stand, the president would not prevail.
[02:58:17.794 --> 02:58:21.014]  And anybody in the office knows that, and so he's not going to try.
[02:58:21.975 --> 02:58:28.996]  Plus, they're brought up through politics from the beginning as stabled whores of these people, so they've got them on both ends of it.
[02:58:29.256 --> 02:58:31.636]  Dr. Roberts, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:58:31.676 --> 02:58:34.257]  You can just Google his name and check out all the books he's written.
