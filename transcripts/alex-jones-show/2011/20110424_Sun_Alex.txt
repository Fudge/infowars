[00:00:05.312 --> 00:00:06.613]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.613 --> 00:00:08.394]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:10.155]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:11.736]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:13.277]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.277 --> 00:00:17.459]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:21.562]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:33.876]  Well, we knew we had him coming on a couple days ago, but I like to surprise the listeners, so out of the gates for the first 30 minutes of the live transmission today.
[00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:51.901]  Lou Dobbs, of course, syndicated radio host, former CNN host, host of Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Channel, one of their number one programs over there, is our guest for the next 30 minutes, and I can't wait to pick his brain and get his take on the economy, the new war in Libya,
[00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:54.322]  The inflation.
[00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:55.902]  Who is Glenn Beck's replacement going to be?
[00:00:55.902 --> 00:00:58.663]  Could it be Lou Dobbs or Andrew Napolitano?
[00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:03.005]  I hear they're certainly being looked at right now from some of the Fox Insiders.
[00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:04.925]  But we're going to discuss it all.
[00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:13.508]  But in this short few minutes we have in this opening segment, Lou, of all the things going on, what do you think is most important in the world today?
[00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:15.769]  What's number one on your radar screen?
[00:01:16.363 --> 00:01:22.685]  Well, number one, first of all, Alex, great to be with you again and have an opportunity to talk with you about these issues.
[00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:35.330]  The number one issue, as far as I'm concerned right now, is restoring the rule of the majority to our government and making sure this great constitutional republic is led and conducts itself
[00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:55.440]  In concert with our national values and ideals, whether we're talking about foreign policy, whether we're talking about the wars that are underway in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, or whether we're talking about how to restore prosperity to this country and to create jobs and wealth and to get this great country moving.
[00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:13.976]  Well, when you talk about the Constitution under assault, undoubtedly, I mean, out of the gates, going back now four weeks ago, the UN comes out and says, we have a resolution to stop, to start bombing Libya, and Obama didn't even, the President didn't even consult with Congress.
[00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:16.719]  At least Bush went and got a resolution for force.
[00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:36.554]  Exactly, and by the way, the man whom this president is a candidate, accused of being a unilateralist, went before the United Nations and got their approval, support, and cooperation, as well as the United States Congress, and they did it twice, both in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:02:36.554 --> 00:02:42.579]  If you will, the contradiction is stunning on the part of Mr. Obama.
[00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:54.423]  And now it's a stalemate and they say it's not going well, so there's more and more discussions by top generals of putting ground troops in, not just CIA advisors.
[00:02:54.423 --> 00:02:56.164]  Unfortunately, that's exactly right.
[00:02:56.164 --> 00:03:06.450]  The military analyst with whom I've spoken and a number of former generals who are very close to obviously the general staff of the Pentagon.
[00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:18.187]  Uh, saying point blank that they cautioned this administration against taking on, uh, Muammar Gaddafi and opening, uh, hostilities against Libya.
[00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:27.074]  Uh, and now they are cautioning against the ground troops, uh, because they have said from the outset that nothing can be assured without our forces on the ground.
[00:03:27.074 --> 00:03:33.159]  Uh, and as we know, particularly the instance of Afghanistan, Alex,
[00:03:34.263 --> 00:03:39.224]  We know that doesn't assure a timely outcome either.
[00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:40.285]  No, it certainly doesn't.
[00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.525]  And that's four different major conflicts.
[00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:45.886]  Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, and now Libya.
[00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:46.266]  Right.
[00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:59.689]  And we have the French pouring into the Ivory Coast, removing one thug, and now openly installing the other rebel leader, who they admit has been running around with his people with machetes, chopping up men, women, and children.
[00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:13.078]  The involvement of the French in the Ivory Coast, wherever the French have gone over history, as you well know, they have left independent nations that were former French colonies in horrible shape.
[00:04:13.078 --> 00:04:20.123]  The Ivory Coast is being exploited by the West for its natural resources, most prominently oil.
[00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:34.104]  This is a mess, and whether one styles it as NATO or the French or the United Kingdom or the United States and NATO or just the United States, somebody needs to take a very deep breath and say, wait a minute.
[00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:37.081]  Is this who America is?
[00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:39.302]  Is this who Americans are?
[00:04:39.302 --> 00:04:42.403]  Is this the nation that we want to be?
[00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:46.263]  And I think most Americans would say absolutely not.
[00:04:46.263 --> 00:04:46.804]  Absolutely.
[00:04:46.804 --> 00:04:47.644]  The polls show that.
[00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:51.865]  Lou Dobbs, host of Lou Dobbs Tonight on Fox Business Network.
[00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:52.705]  LouDobbs.com.
[00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:56.386]  We'll be right back with him to continue along this important line of discussion.
[00:04:56.386 --> 00:04:57.066]  These U.N.
[00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:57.866]  wars.
[00:04:57.866 --> 00:04:58.326]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.448 --> 00:05:03.170]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.476]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:10.018]  Saving means to make money.
[00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:18.808]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:27.073]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:05:27.073 --> 00:05:35.077]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:40.300]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.461]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:05:45.182 --> 00:05:50.626]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:05:50.626 --> 00:05:53.248]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:06:18.015 --> 00:06:34.245]  It is Friday the 15th day of April 2011 and we've got a real treat as far as those that want to know what's really happening in the world with a wide breadth of analysis on the economy, geopolitical developments.
[00:06:34.245 --> 00:06:34.766]  He was one of the
[00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:41.527]  Founding members there at CNN when it kicked off in the early 1980s.
[00:06:41.527 --> 00:06:46.588]  He, of course, needs no introduction, Lou Dobbs, and he's the host at, what, 7 p.m.
[00:06:46.588 --> 00:06:50.389]  Eastern on Fox Business Network of Lou Dobbs Tonight.
[00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.249]  He also, from 2 p.m.
[00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:56.730]  Eastern on, also hosts a very successful syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.810]  The website's loudobbs.com.
[00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.851]  Of course, our websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and gcnlive.com.
[00:07:05.371 --> 00:07:05.471]  Yes.
[00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:25.923]  A decade or more, I remember watching you on CNN.
[00:07:25.923 --> 00:07:30.425]  You're the real trailblazer on mainline cable television.
[00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:42.630]  You were just going off their own statements, the UN's own statements, the Council on Foreign Relations' own statements about a supernational private corporate banking world government eroding national sovereignty.
[00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.370]  No, I understand.
[00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:04.896]  I don't know.
[00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:29.015]  Just Obama following the orders of the UN, not even consulting Congress to start this new war.
[00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:30.896]  Now they're talking about ground troops.
[00:08:30.896 --> 00:08:47.767]  What is it like, a decade after you began to be the first to expose this on mainline TV, to be demonized, to be attacked, to have somebody shoot at your house, to go through all of this, to expose the North American Union, and now it's almost passe, but you were demonized for it.
[00:08:48.616 --> 00:08:54.679]  And of course, as you know, Alex, that's the reflex of the left in this country.
[00:08:54.679 --> 00:09:03.543]  And I expect to be attacked or take positions that aren't popular with the left, and that's fine.
[00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:06.884]  Because my interest is America and America.
[00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:16.311]  You know, that is just where I happen to reside intellectually, emotionally, physically.
[00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:22.036]  And I make no apology for being an American who is concerned most about America and America.
[00:09:22.036 --> 00:09:23.537]  It's that straightforward.
[00:09:23.537 --> 00:09:34.826]  And to see whether... My great concern in all of this over the years has been, aside from a position on any one of these developments, so that our audience understands
[00:09:35.447 --> 00:09:55.102]  That when we make a deal with the United Nations, when we sign on to the World Trade Organization, for that matter, when we're part of NATO, we are at some margin, at some level, and in some cases, at an extreme level, consigning away this nation's sovereignty.
[00:09:55.102 --> 00:10:04.088]  And we are deferring national interests to a broader interest, whether it be a European interest, whether it be a global interest, or whether it be an Asian interest.
[00:10:04.088 --> 00:10:04.769]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:06.488 --> 00:10:23.917]  Our leaders, our elite, have on too many occasions sought to obfuscate that reality and to act to pretend as though there's no consequence or implication for the well-being of the American people or the national interest.
[00:10:23.917 --> 00:10:28.580]  And I find that to be not only hypocrisy, but frankly, un-American.
[00:10:29.775 --> 00:10:30.935]  Lou Dobbs is our guest.
[00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:44.620]  Lou, when you, over the last decade, talk about globalists, talk about elitists, you would put up quotes from the Council on Foreign Relations, from Robert Pasteur, from the internal SPP documents that Judicial Watch sued and got.
[00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:54.787]  Judicial Watch and others you had on your show had the documents, but still Media Matters and others would imply it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:59.049]  But from your research, who are these international interests?
[00:10:59.049 --> 00:11:00.450]  Who are these elitists?
[00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.212]  And what is their overall goal?
[00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:11.057]  And from your research, why is that basically in direct opposition to the interest of our free republic?
[00:11:13.209 --> 00:11:17.732]  Let me answer the latter part first, if I may, Alex.
[00:11:17.732 --> 00:11:30.100]  This free republic, this great constitutional republic, is utterly dependent on an informed citizenry and an engaged and participatory citizenry.
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.283]  What is occurring now is a constraint of information.
[00:11:35.283 --> 00:11:42.127]  One would think that given the internet, all of the various media, all of the vehicles of communication,
[00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:46.423]  That American citizens would be better informed than ever.
[00:11:46.423 --> 00:11:56.409]  Know far more about the public policy choices that are being made, whether it's in Congress, whether it's in the bureaucracy of the executive, whether it's in the judiciary.
[00:11:56.409 --> 00:12:01.632]  But in point of fact, we know less today than we did 50 years ago about what our government is doing.
[00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:28.970]  And the reasons for it are many, but among them, it's been a decision among elites, and by the way, I'm talking about frankly both political parties, in one way or another, being involved in an effort to simply preside rather than to represent, and to do so with a view that they somehow are ordained to lead rather than dependent upon the consent of the government.
[00:12:29.608 --> 00:12:44.581]  So when we start talking about the elites that are, if you will, not necessarily conspiring, but certainly acting as if they were in a collusion and concert to create the North American Union,
[00:12:46.063 --> 00:12:47.604]  It's an empirical statement.
[00:12:47.604 --> 00:12:48.785]  It's based on fact.
[00:12:48.785 --> 00:12:51.126]  It's not a question of ideology.
[00:12:51.126 --> 00:12:53.888]  It's not a question of philosophy or partisanship.
[00:12:53.888 --> 00:13:02.414]  The reality is that the Security and Prosperity Partnership is the foundation and was intended as the foundation to bring three countries together.
[00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:04.356]  Mexico, the United States, and Canada.
[00:13:04.896 --> 00:13:30.651]  And that harmonization, as they like to call it, and I'm talking about the elites of the United States military, that of the Canadians at Mexico, our business elites, our political elites, and frankly they're represented again by both political parties, are working to bring about not only a custom union, not only a common currency, but an actual
[00:13:33.783 --> 00:13:37.786]  Our consolidation of three nations into one.
[00:13:37.786 --> 00:13:53.736]  Well that's what's so frustrating is that you are covering real information like if you were a weatherman and a thunderstorm blew through and the water measuring meter said an inch and a half of rain fell and you're sitting there with the rain gauge showing the rain.
[00:13:53.736 --> 00:13:58.759]  Everybody knows this is happening and then they're moving forward these elites with these programs
[00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:19.778]  But then they have no respect for the general public and play this deceptive game of saying Lou Dobbs is lying to you when we have this ruling political international class that, as you said, tries to rule by deception and doesn't want the people involved in governing through their representatives.
[00:14:19.778 --> 00:14:24.322]  If you use the word rule, I would use the word attempt to end the plot.
[00:14:25.625 --> 00:14:43.156]  And, you know, the effect in some instances may be the same, Alex, but what we are truly watching is an effort on the part of a group of elites worldwide who wish to bring about a One World Order.
[00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:54.143]  It may not be particularly a New World Order, since the effort has been underway for some time, but that is one of the tensions that obviously work in our global society.
[00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.093]  And you look at this global order they're trying to establish.
[00:14:59.093 --> 00:15:00.994]  It's very undemocratic.
[00:15:00.994 --> 00:15:03.576]  It is against sovereignty.
[00:15:03.576 --> 00:15:06.478]  It is always openly anti-family.
[00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:11.903]  Anything that is independent, anything that they can't control, they want us dependent.
[00:15:11.903 --> 00:15:15.786]  That's what these elites want, these mega corporations that aren't free market.
[00:15:15.786 --> 00:15:16.586]  That's their goal.
[00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:20.513]  I want to read to you a headline, if we can put it back on screen.
[00:15:20.513 --> 00:15:27.325]  And I first saw this in the news in 2002, and when I would cover it, even in the Washington Post as a footnote, people couldn't believe it.
[00:15:27.325 --> 00:15:28.427]  But here is the Ottawa...
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.784]  Citizen, one of the big papers in Canada for those that don't know, February 22nd, 2008.
[00:15:34.784 --> 00:15:36.785]  This is three years ago.
[00:15:36.785 --> 00:15:40.367]  And there's new articles on this as well as part of the Continental Security Perimeter.
[00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:42.089]  And it says, Canada, U.S.
[00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:45.071]  agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies.
[00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:52.255]  And if you read the Pentagon Agreement with Canada and Mexico, it says we will aid each other during civil unrest.
[00:15:52.255 --> 00:15:57.039]  So, and I've had generals on who are retired that say, yes, this has been in the works for a long time.
[00:16:01.343 --> 00:16:16.817]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[00:16:16.817 --> 00:16:20.501]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:34.273]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[00:16:34.273 --> 00:16:41.538]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[00:16:42.219 --> 00:16:52.605]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[00:16:52.605 --> 00:16:56.528]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[00:16:56.528 --> 00:16:59.650]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:04.852]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:17:04.852 --> 00:17:05.772]  Number one.
[00:17:05.772 --> 00:17:09.193]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:17:09.193 --> 00:17:10.053]  Number two.
[00:17:10.053 --> 00:17:14.955]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:15.695]  It's true.
[00:17:15.695 --> 00:17:20.557]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:17:20.557 --> 00:17:21.377]  Number three.
[00:17:21.377 --> 00:17:24.979]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:17:24.979 --> 00:17:28.680]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.680]  Number 4.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.441]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:36.122]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:17:36.122 --> 00:17:36.902]  Number 5.
[00:17:36.902 --> 00:17:41.043]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:17:41.043 --> 00:17:46.105]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:04.010]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:08.292]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:18:08.292 --> 00:18:13.115]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:18:13.115 --> 00:18:18.938]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:18:18.938 --> 00:18:25.941]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:18:28.736 --> 00:18:34.238]  I'm looking for America.
[00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:36.219]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:18:36.219 --> 00:18:38.479]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:43.101]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[00:18:43.101 --> 00:18:47.022]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:18:54.679 --> 00:19:00.284]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:07.230]  Over the last year Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:09.872]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:19:09.872 --> 00:19:12.314]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with eFoots Direct.
[00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:16.698]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:18.179]  You must act automatically.
[00:19:18.399 --> 00:19:21.901]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:24.663]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:33.028]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:19:33.028 --> 00:19:35.810]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:45.740]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[00:19:47.842 --> 00:19:50.305]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:50.345]  800-409-5633.
[00:20:01.317 --> 00:20:02.858]  Coast to coast.
[00:20:02.858 --> 00:20:04.900]  Direct from Austin.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:13.527]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:13.527 --> 00:20:18.492]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:18.492 --> 00:20:19.733]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:32.219]  And I've had generals on who retired that say, yes, this has been in the works for a long time.
[00:20:32.219 --> 00:20:32.520]  Right.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:40.865]  To use foreign troops in America and vice versa, I mean, it doesn't get any more crazy or New World Order than that.
[00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:47.588]  And it is, again, for the very reason to state it, it is not a matter of public knowledge.
[00:20:47.588 --> 00:20:53.472]  It is not a part of the consciousness of American society and the voting public.
[00:20:54.282 --> 00:21:19.555]  And this reflect that has grown up over the course of the last, particularly the last 30 years in this country, speaking only about America, that either political party, leaders, elected leaders of this country, would in any way seek to deny a larger body of public knowledge is to be contemptible.
[00:21:19.555 --> 00:21:22.197]  And the national media has too often
[00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:24.300]  I don't know.
[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:50.525]  And that's unfortunate, because we need watchdogs on our 4th Estate, not lapdogs.
[00:21:50.525 --> 00:21:58.010]  And unfortunately, most of the national liberal media is actually focused on performing that role.
[00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.374]  The role of lapdog and helper, rather than watchdog.
[00:22:03.234 --> 00:22:04.935]  Well, that was my next issue.
[00:22:04.935 --> 00:22:30.655]  As the establishment media kind of circles the wagons with the political class, we're seeing Jay Rockefeller, we're seeing Lieberman, we're seeing all these statements, Cass Sunstein, about restricting the free press, fairness doctrine, taxes on what they call conspiracy theories, things that they, and Cass Sunstein, of course, the regulations are listed, not believing in man-made global warming.
[00:22:31.555 --> 00:22:35.138]  Well, we see Arianna Huffington saying, how do we shut down Fox News?
[00:22:35.138 --> 00:22:37.199]  How do we shut down Glenn Beck?
[00:22:37.199 --> 00:22:47.246]  We see two weeks ago in Politico, I don't know if you saw it, the chilling memos from the head of Media Matters saying we are going to guerrilla infiltrate with spies and organizations.
[00:22:47.246 --> 00:22:51.849]  We're going to destroy not just Fox News, but this list of conservative sites.
[00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:56.072]  And you go there, you're being demonized, I'm being demonized, Judge Napolitano.
[00:22:56.072 --> 00:22:59.794]  I mean, these people aren't what even you'd call liberal.
[00:22:59.794 --> 00:23:00.735]  I mean, they're more like
[00:23:01.555 --> 00:23:02.956]  Joe Stalin or something!
[00:23:02.956 --> 00:23:06.317]  I mean they really are authoritarian and scary!
[00:23:06.317 --> 00:23:15.539]  They are authoritarian in outlook and I think in value structure which makes them extraordinarily dangerous.
[00:23:15.539 --> 00:23:21.001]  Not necessarily to Fox News but to the country.
[00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:27.263]  When media takes on a role that is utterly destructive in intent and purpose
[00:23:28.348 --> 00:23:39.154]  And that is precisely what many of these advocacy organizations do, and they pretend to be some sort of watchdog organization.
[00:23:39.154 --> 00:23:45.677]  But they pretend to be forming that role when they are in fact advocacy and activist organizations.
[00:23:45.677 --> 00:23:51.360]  But the great thing, Alex, is that the American people are getting a very clear look at who and what they are.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.321]  And what their designs are.
[00:23:54.321 --> 00:24:01.945]  That's healthy for the nation and I'm delighted to see that light shine very brightly on who they are and what they're up to.
[00:24:02.964 --> 00:24:17.297]  Well, I don't want to spend all our time on that group, but, I mean, they are 501c3, and I know mild libertarian groups who have their 501c3 jerked for just getting involved, you know, in stating their opinion.
[00:24:17.297 --> 00:24:26.085]  How can they be a pure House organ of George Soros, openly calling for the end of free speech in America, and then be given 501c3?
[00:24:26.085 --> 00:24:28.147]  I mean, that is very discriminatory.
[00:24:28.955 --> 00:24:30.317]  It is.
[00:24:30.317 --> 00:24:43.490]  It's at the very least curious and the use of 5013Cs in our society is something I think that ought to be looked at irrespective of the ideology or the intent.
[00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.831]  We have become a nation of
[00:24:45.892 --> 00:24:52.196]  of non-profits that are starting to supplant in many ways to be Alex.
[00:24:52.196 --> 00:25:04.063]  Traditionally, the functions of government, particularly at the local, county, and state level, I worry less about the federal level, honestly, the national level.
[00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:09.527]  But we need to understand what the implications are for all of these non-profits that have grown up over the years.
[00:25:09.527 --> 00:25:11.888]  That they've grown up, by the way, they number in the billions.
[00:25:12.683 --> 00:25:26.440]  Some of them with the very best of purposes, but the fact is we are diluting our system of government through those non-profits, NGOs, and other entities that have been created.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.405]  I'd much prefer people turn to government for the services
[00:25:31.185 --> 00:25:33.287]  Well, isn't that an unfair playing field, too?
[00:25:33.287 --> 00:25:35.469]  I mean, the UN model is these NGOs.
[00:25:35.469 --> 00:25:36.269]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:37.450]  I want your take on this.
[00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:45.436]  Thousands of waivers handed out to Fortune 500, but even smaller groups that have given campaign contributions to the Democrats and Obama.
[00:25:45.436 --> 00:25:50.400]  With its hundreds of thousands of employees, McDonald's gets a waiver on buying insurance for its employees.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.505]  But I'm, if this stuff gets implemented, I've got to get insurance for all of my employees, and I will take part of their check to do it.
[00:25:57.805 --> 00:26:05.829]  So, isn't that an unfair trade advantage that a hamburger place right next to McDonald's, a mom and pop, they've got to get insurance, but McDonald's doesn't?
[00:26:05.829 --> 00:26:12.131]  So if you go, you know, pay money to the emperor, he then waves his wand and gives you an unfair trade advantage?
[00:26:12.131 --> 00:26:14.493]  I don't think there's any question about it whatsoever.
[00:26:14.493 --> 00:26:22.196]  It is not only unfair, but so transparently patronage that it's nauseating.
[00:26:22.196 --> 00:26:26.318]  When you look at the principal beneficiary of these waivers.
[00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:30.850]  The United Auto Workers.
[00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.437]  What is the principal beneficiary of these waivers?
[00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:49.095]  You go beyond that, it's the supporters of this administration who received the greatest amount of money, which by the way wasn't even revealed publicly by the administration of the Democratic leadership and Obamacare.
[00:26:49.095 --> 00:26:57.297]  The principal beneficiary of the early retirement support program, which amounts to $5 billion, goes to the United Auto Workers here.
[00:26:57.297 --> 00:26:58.858]  So I mean, it just goes on and on.
[00:27:00.296 --> 00:27:01.316]  Incredible.
[00:27:01.316 --> 00:27:05.057]  A lot of other questions in the limited time we've got left for you.
[00:27:05.057 --> 00:27:07.378]  What do you see coming up in this next election?
[00:27:07.378 --> 00:27:09.519]  We see the $40 billion cut.
[00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:15.941]  Ron Paul has come out and said that it was all basically stuff that had already been agreed to cut and what was left over from highway funds.
[00:27:15.941 --> 00:27:19.442]  He's even saying Ryan's budget isn't going to fix things.
[00:27:19.442 --> 00:27:19.922]  If we don't
[00:27:20.342 --> 00:27:29.455]  Stop the banker bailouts and deal with what the Federal Reserve's doing, monetizing the debt and devaluing the currency, that all of this is window dressing.
[00:27:29.455 --> 00:27:32.999]  Lou Dobbs is a real financial expert, decades in the trenches.
[00:27:32.999 --> 00:27:35.403]  What's your view on what's happening with the budget?
[00:27:35.831 --> 00:27:42.997]  Well, I had the opportunity to talk with a congressman two days ago, and we discussed exactly these issues, Alex.
[00:27:42.997 --> 00:27:56.429]  And the congressman does question whether or not any of this is sufficient, given that there are larger issues than his views, and of course, the principle among those is the Federal Reserve and the banking system.
[00:27:57.429 --> 00:28:09.654]  And the reforms that are necessary, it's unquestionable that we need to reform our banking system, that we need to take a very strong look and reorganize, in my judgment, the Federal Reserve.
[00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:12.795]  But that is a long-term effort.
[00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:15.056]  It's going to take years to accomplish.
[00:28:15.056 --> 00:28:23.239]  What I am so pleased with is that Congressman Paul Ryan has come forward with the boldest, most effective, in my opinion,
[00:28:23.968 --> 00:28:24.329]  I think so.
[00:28:32.148 --> 00:28:33.569]  In history.
[00:28:33.569 --> 00:28:41.093]  Unfortunately, that's the kind of plan that is necessary because we've got, as you know, the greatest debt and the most tremendous deficits in our history.
[00:28:41.093 --> 00:28:49.357]  But he has, I think, with an opening stake, set the bar very high.
[00:28:49.357 --> 00:28:59.102]  And as we watched, the President couldn't come close to it with a rather evil fiscal policy speech that he gave at George Washington University Wednesday.
[00:29:00.712 --> 00:29:04.633]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[00:29:04.633 --> 00:29:05.894]  Tyranny is here.
[00:29:05.894 --> 00:29:09.615]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:12.056]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:29:12.056 --> 00:29:17.918]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:29:17.918 --> 00:29:24.160]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:30.563]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:29:30.563 --> 00:29:34.745]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:29:34.745 --> 00:29:39.028]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:29:39.028 --> 00:29:44.991]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:48.533]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:29:48.533 --> 00:29:50.514]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:29:50.514 --> 00:29:50.954]  It's here.

[00:30:01.378 --> 00:30:03.099]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.099 --> 00:30:08.401]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:30:08.401 --> 00:30:09.942]  Saving means to make money.
[00:30:09.942 --> 00:30:18.706]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:26.989]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:30:26.989 --> 00:30:34.993]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:30:34.993 --> 00:30:40.215]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:30:40.215 --> 00:30:42.376]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:04.435]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:04.435 --> 00:31:05.355]  Number one.
[00:31:05.355 --> 00:31:08.778]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:09.638]  Number two.
[00:31:09.638 --> 00:31:14.521]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:14.521 --> 00:31:15.282]  It's true.
[00:31:15.282 --> 00:31:20.145]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:20.965]  Number three.
[00:31:20.965 --> 00:31:24.568]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:24.568 --> 00:31:28.250]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:29.250]  Number 4.
[00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:32.011]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:35.693]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:36.493]  Number 5.
[00:31:36.493 --> 00:31:40.635]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:40.635 --> 00:31:45.677]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:31:45.677 --> 00:31:49.858]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:31:49.858 --> 00:31:51.639]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[00:32:00.064 --> 00:32:07.010]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.653]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:32:09.653 --> 00:32:12.095]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:32:12.095 --> 00:32:16.479]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:17.940]  You must act automatically.
[00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:21.682]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:32:21.682 --> 00:32:24.444]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:32:24.444 --> 00:32:32.809]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:32:32.809 --> 00:32:35.591]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:45.521]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[00:32:47.683 --> 00:32:50.066]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[00:32:50.066 --> 00:32:50.106]  800-409-5633.
[00:33:01.331 --> 00:33:04.932]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[00:33:04.932 --> 00:33:12.335]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:12.335 --> 00:33:18.377]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:18.377 --> 00:33:20.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:29.741 --> 00:33:32.443]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:32.443 --> 00:33:33.944]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:33.944 --> 00:33:37.366]  It is Wednesday, the 20th day of April, 2011.
[00:33:37.366 --> 00:33:42.610]  And for a little bit into the next hour, Lord Christopher Monckton is going to be our guest.
[00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:46.772]  Then I'm going to get into the latest incredible economic news.
[00:33:46.772 --> 00:33:51.596]  It turns out the Associated Press is confirming the White House tried to get Standard & Poor's
[00:33:52.216 --> 00:33:53.497]  We're good to go.
[00:34:17.753 --> 00:34:23.619]  And they're also demanding at checkpoints to grab your phone and plug them in and download everything off of it without warrants.
[00:34:23.619 --> 00:34:31.349]  I mean, this is total 1984 and the phones have been designed under federal law to have the back door for them to do it.
[00:34:32.858 --> 00:34:34.379]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:34:34.379 --> 00:34:39.342]  Brent crude climbs above $122 on week dollar.
[00:34:39.342 --> 00:34:41.864]  There's the Washington Post article, actually.
[00:34:41.864 --> 00:34:42.724]  AP also has it.
[00:34:42.724 --> 00:34:46.967]  Obama administration officials tried to keep S&P rating at stable.
[00:34:46.967 --> 00:34:56.633]  And they have the nerve to say upping budgets and raising the debt ceiling, that that will stop a default when S&P and every other major economic institution with common sense.
[00:34:56.633 --> 00:34:57.214]  It's not hard.
[00:34:57.214 --> 00:34:59.455]  It's like saying up is up, down is down.
[00:34:59.455 --> 00:35:01.216]  Left is right.
[00:35:01.216 --> 00:35:01.897]  Black is white.
[00:35:02.857 --> 00:35:03.857]  It's simple.
[00:35:03.857 --> 00:35:04.758]  We're saying up is up.
[00:35:04.758 --> 00:35:06.278]  They're saying up is down.
[00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.759]  It's amazing.
[00:35:07.759 --> 00:35:17.182]  And then meanwhile, they're saying no more debt will keep us from defaulting when we're actually technically defaulting because they're now hyperinflating and monetizing over 70% of the T-bills.
[00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:18.863]  But that's coming up next hour.
[00:35:18.863 --> 00:35:25.025]  And then Steve Watson, writer for InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com joins us from London via video Skype as well.
[00:35:25.325 --> 00:35:31.770]  To break down things like the Royal Wedding and the Republicans aren't allowed to go out and protest, but everybody else is allowed to celebrate.
[00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:41.198]  We'll also get his view as a political scientist on what's happening with the situation in Libya and in the Middle East.
[00:35:41.198 --> 00:35:53.789]  But Lord Christopher Monckton III, Viscount of Monckton and Brentley, is the leading, there's no doubt, defender of science and reality when it comes to the fraud that is man-made global warming and the
[00:35:54.329 --> 00:35:58.012]  Ken Lay Al Gore plan to tax all human activity.
[00:35:58.012 --> 00:36:04.216]  He's a British politician, public speaker, former newspaper editor, and hereditary peer, formerly a member of the Conservative Party.
[00:36:04.216 --> 00:36:07.139]  He now formerly also headed up the UK Independence Party.
[00:36:08.439 --> 00:36:14.084]  He served in the Conservative Central Office, also worked as one of the top advisors on science to Margaret Thatcher at No.
[00:36:14.084 --> 00:36:16.706]  10 Policy Unit in the 1980s.
[00:36:16.706 --> 00:36:20.649]  He also worked for the Universe, the Sunny Telegraph, Today and the Evening Standard.
[00:36:20.649 --> 00:36:25.954]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org or ukip.org.
[00:36:25.954 --> 00:36:27.715]  And here are the headlines today.
[00:36:27.715 --> 00:36:32.760]  We'll cover this first before we get into the latest on the social engineers trying to seize the energy sources.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:33.721]  I don't know.
[00:36:56.437 --> 00:36:58.480]  Alex, as always, it's a pleasure.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:03.648]  I'm sitting here in Edinburgh in my apartment overlooking Edinburgh Castle.
[00:37:03.648 --> 00:37:08.314]  The sun is shining, the weather is good, and the politics are lousy.
[00:37:10.868 --> 00:37:26.937]  For those that don't know who the UK Independence Party is in the US, it's basically similar to the Tea Party or the Ron Paul type folks that openly speak out against the global government, openly quote the scallywags on their plans and openly fight them.
[00:37:26.937 --> 00:37:33.100]  And your party, not just in the UK, but in Europe, similar groups are exploding and gaining ground.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.683]  Tell us about this new D-Day invasion of the New World Order system.
[00:37:39.107 --> 00:37:48.197]  Well what is happening now is that in Britain the United Kingdom Independence Party is very much on the march.
[00:37:48.197 --> 00:37:58.789]  We only were founded 17 years ago by an academic and now suddenly we have grown into being the second biggest party in
[00:37:59.189 --> 00:38:05.573]  In British politics, in European Parliament elections, because the European Parliament isn't a real Parliament.
[00:38:05.573 --> 00:38:07.094]  It's not like your Congress.
[00:38:07.094 --> 00:38:08.534]  It can't make laws.
[00:38:08.534 --> 00:38:12.577]  It's just a kind of talking shop, like the Duma of John Nicholas II.
[00:38:12.577 --> 00:38:14.558]  But it shows the will of the British people.
[00:38:16.064 --> 00:38:39.337]  So the will of the British people, it does show the will because we came second, we beat everybody except the Conservatives that time and then in the recent by-election for the British Parliament in the seat of Barnsley where the former Labour member is now serving time in prison for having fiddled his expenses, we came second beating the Conservative and
[00:38:39.497 --> 00:38:39.877]  We're good.
[00:38:55.127 --> 00:38:59.470]  Now we're fighting local government elections all around Britain.
[00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:02.132]  We have local government elections in England.
[00:39:02.132 --> 00:39:07.456]  We have Scottish Parliament elections in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly elections in Wales.
[00:39:07.456 --> 00:39:09.777]  UKIP are contesting all three.
[00:39:09.777 --> 00:39:16.542]  I am leading the UKIP effort in Scotland and in particular we're beginning to make some headway because the
[00:39:17.523 --> 00:39:27.593]  Scottish National Party, which effectively is communist, they are at present the ruling clique in the Scottish Parliament.
[00:39:27.593 --> 00:39:38.824]  And they came out with a manifesto earlier in the week in which they said that they were going to generate 100% of Scotland's electricity by so-called renewable means, which they mainly mean windmills.
[00:39:39.444 --> 00:39:41.506]  In just nine years' time.
[00:39:41.506 --> 00:39:54.094]  And I found myself at a Hustings just a few days ago, opposite Rosanna Cunningham, who is the so-called environment so-called minister for the so-called Scottish so-called government.
[00:39:55.157 --> 00:39:57.498]  And she knows nothing about the environment.
[00:39:57.498 --> 00:39:59.599]  Of course, most politicians don't.
[00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:02.320]  And she was saying, well, it is necessary to save the planet.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.781]  And, of course, it isn't.
[00:40:03.781 --> 00:40:19.948]  But I said, look, if you believe that, if you really believe that in nine years' time you're going to have enough windmills doing their thing to generate all of Scotland's electricity, you only have to go back as far as last December, when we had no wind for an entire month.
[00:40:19.948 --> 00:40:21.169]  We had the second coldest
[00:40:21.169 --> 00:40:25.230]  It's the coldest winter in Britain since records began in 1659.
[00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:29.171]  That's what global warming means to us at the moment.
[00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:42.374]  It was very, very cold and the percentage of UK and Scottish electricity contributed by all the wind farms that we have over that bitterly cold month, and we needed all the electricity we could get, was at 0.0%.
[00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:45.601]  Amazing.
[00:40:45.601 --> 00:40:50.230]  But to be clear, you are now standing for the Scottish Parliament.
[00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.213]  You are now running for office.
[00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:53.957]  That's right.
[00:40:53.957 --> 00:40:56.658]  It's most unlikely that I'll succeed this time round.
[00:40:56.658 --> 00:41:00.438]  We're not the kind of politicians that pretend we're going to win when it's clear we're not.
[00:41:00.438 --> 00:41:04.439]  We're too new in Scotland to expect to storm the gates yet.
[00:41:04.439 --> 00:41:07.820]  And the press here are terrified of us.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:18.642]  But here they are with the SNP, the ruling faction here, coming out with this mad, I mean, heroically lunatic policy of generating electricity with the wind.
[00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:22.272]  And at huge cost to taxpayers, of course.
[00:41:25.353 --> 00:41:36.721]  That has from the outset opposed all these stupid windmills is the United Kingdom Independence Party and can we get ourselves onto a television program or into a newspaper?
[00:41:36.721 --> 00:41:38.202]  Virtually not at all.
[00:41:38.202 --> 00:41:40.864]  They will not let us anywhere near the media here.
[00:41:40.864 --> 00:41:42.345]  It's a closed shop.
[00:41:42.345 --> 00:41:52.533]  It's a little kind of Marxist cozy between the liberals and the socialists and the SNP and which of them is more communist is not for me to say but they're all pretty far to the left.
[00:41:53.193 --> 00:41:55.094]  And the media up here are exactly the same.
[00:41:55.094 --> 00:41:56.754]  They don't want the truth told.
[00:41:56.754 --> 00:41:59.335]  They don't want the voice of democracy to be heard.
[00:41:59.335 --> 00:42:02.395]  And I'll give you a little vignette, which will really make you laugh, Alex.
[00:42:02.395 --> 00:42:04.096]  This was absolutely wonderful.
[00:42:04.096 --> 00:42:13.758]  When Nigel Farage, who's a regular guest on your show, came up very kindly to support me and do the launch in Edinburgh of UKIP's manifesto,
[00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:22.356]  One of the topics on that manifesto is that we want to give people the same right as they have in Switzerland.
[00:42:22.356 --> 00:42:36.849]  So that if the people think that the governing class is not representing them on a particular subject that matters to the people, they can call a referendum if 1% of them sign a request saying we want a referendum.
[00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:37.409]  A recall!
[00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:53.044]  Yeah, exactly that, and then that referendum on any subject they like has to be held, and the result is binding on the Scottish Parliament, the Westminster Parliament, and of course the unelected Dismal Commissars of Europe.
[00:42:53.044 --> 00:42:53.925]  And that was our policy.
[00:43:00.592 --> 00:43:01.773]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:43:01.773 --> 00:43:08.698]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:43:08.698 --> 00:43:11.260]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.424]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:43:16.624 --> 00:43:19.665]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:43:19.665 --> 00:43:21.986]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:43:21.986 --> 00:43:28.248]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:43:28.248 --> 00:43:31.629]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:43:31.629 --> 00:43:37.411]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:43:37.411 --> 00:43:39.051]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:40.332]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:43:40.332 --> 00:43:43.012]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:43:43.012 --> 00:43:44.433]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:43:44.713 --> 00:43:47.035]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:44:02.213 --> 00:44:06.174]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:06.174 --> 00:44:15.037]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:44:15.037 --> 00:44:19.658]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:44:19.658 --> 00:44:30.481]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:44:31.121 --> 00:44:40.630]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:46.075]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:44:46.075 --> 00:44:53.561]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:44:53.561 --> 00:44:56.324]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[00:45:01.437 --> 00:45:05.458]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:08.699]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:45:08.699 --> 00:45:13.480]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:19.881]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:45:19.881 --> 00:45:22.122]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:45:22.662 --> 00:45:22.962]  Tim Geithner?
[00:45:22.962 --> 00:45:23.483]  Bernanke?
[00:45:23.483 --> 00:45:24.083]  They're arsonists!
[00:45:24.083 --> 00:45:25.244]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:45:25.244 --> 00:45:27.665]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:45:41.573 --> 00:45:45.935]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:45:45.935 --> 00:45:48.836]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:45:48.836 --> 00:45:57.959]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:46:00.011 --> 00:46:04.554]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:46:04.554 --> 00:46:05.475]  Number 1.
[00:46:05.475 --> 00:46:08.897]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:46:08.897 --> 00:46:09.758]  Number 2.
[00:46:09.758 --> 00:46:14.661]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:46:14.661 --> 00:46:15.401]  It's true.
[00:46:15.401 --> 00:46:20.265]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:46:20.265 --> 00:46:21.105]  Number 3.
[00:46:21.105 --> 00:46:24.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:46:24.687 --> 00:46:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:29.370]  Number 4.
[00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.131]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:35.813]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:46:35.813 --> 00:46:36.613]  Number 5.
[00:46:36.613 --> 00:46:40.755]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:46:40.755 --> 00:46:45.797]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:46:45.797 --> 00:46:49.978]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:49.978 --> 00:46:51.779]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:46:51.779 --> 00:46:56.381]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[00:46:56.801 --> 00:46:56.961]  877-327-0365.
[00:46:56.961 --> 00:47:03.025]  Coast to Coast.
[00:47:03.025 --> 00:47:05.087]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:05.087 --> 00:47:08.289]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:18.849 --> 00:47:28.858]  Now, I was interviewed by a BBC reporter who, it was quite clear, was, again, from the Marxist wing of the BBC, which means about 99.9% of it.
[00:47:28.858 --> 00:47:35.064]  And I said to her, just out of interest, what did you think of the idea of letting the people decide what matters to them?
[00:47:35.064 --> 00:47:36.585]  And this was her reply.
[00:47:36.585 --> 00:47:44.432]  It's classic BBC, it's classic Marxism, and it really illustrates the problem that democracy now faces, really, worldwide.
[00:47:44.432 --> 00:47:44.933]  She said, well,
[00:47:45.553 --> 00:47:46.714]  Of course you do.
[00:47:46.714 --> 00:47:53.099]  The thing about the people is that if you let them decide what matters, they will vote for trivialities, won't they?
[00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:56.322]  They'll vote for trivial things, things that don't matter.
[00:47:56.322 --> 00:48:00.785]  That was the absolute, instinctual, profound, deeply held contempt
[00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:10.540]  That the BBC and the person of this dopey little reporter had for the rights and freedoms and democracy of ordinary people.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.302]  That's what we're up against, Alex.
[00:48:12.302 --> 00:48:19.870]  This governing class which is sort of taking over and is gradually dismantling democracy everywhere as we speak.
[00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:21.712]  It's largely gone, as you know, in the UK.
[00:48:21.712 --> 00:48:22.674]  We've talked to this before.
[00:48:23.494 --> 00:48:33.506]  Well, I want you to go over that, Lord Monckton, but first digressing back, since you raised this, same thing here in the U.S.
[00:48:33.506 --> 00:48:43.897]  They create regional governments that are basically appointed by the federal bureaucracy, and then they tell the counties, the cities, the states what to do.
[00:48:44.838 --> 00:48:56.305]  And you've got Obama telling the EPA to shut down coal power plants and other plants and even hydroelectric dams with no law behind him.
[00:48:56.305 --> 00:48:58.587]  And then when states stand up against them.
[00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:02.227]  The feds will come in and even seize the facilities.
[00:49:02.227 --> 00:49:08.451]  But then meanwhile, General Electric, who paid no taxes last year, they head up the President's Economic Council.
[00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:14.194]  Obama has given them waivers to open new plants and not upgrade their dirty coal plants.
[00:49:14.194 --> 00:49:19.798]  But everyone else, basically, the head of the Energy Department, has said they're going to start shutting down.
[00:49:19.798 --> 00:49:24.081]  I mean, people call them mindless environmentalists or well-meaning idiots.
[00:49:24.081 --> 00:49:24.981]  They're not idiots.
[00:49:24.981 --> 00:49:25.942]  They're gangsters.
[00:49:26.522 --> 00:49:31.265]  Creating oligopolies, creating monopolies, shutting down their competition.
[00:49:31.265 --> 00:49:37.509]  And it's the same thing in England, where you have government-funded media, and then they won't let the UK Independence Party get on TV.
[00:49:37.509 --> 00:49:45.715]  But regardless, you guys run a couple times in every new area, and then start winning as people hear your common sense being injected.
[00:49:45.715 --> 00:49:56.442]  So for those that don't know, describe how over 70% of UK laws are handed down from the EU, because this is something a lot of Americas don't understand.
[00:49:57.663 --> 00:49:59.664]  That's a very good point, and it's actually 83%.
[00:49:59.664 --> 00:50:07.188]  It's five laws in six handed down by the unelected commissars.
[00:50:07.188 --> 00:50:09.669]  That is the official German title for them.
[00:50:09.669 --> 00:50:16.013]  The commissars, that hated communist term for the people who ran the Soviet government.
[00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:18.114]  The commissars, the whole Soviet constitution
[00:50:18.314 --> 00:50:19.655]  We're good to go.
[00:50:34.285 --> 00:50:37.308]  These people are the enemies of freedom and democracy.
[00:50:37.308 --> 00:50:47.498]  They have their own agenda, which is not an agenda which you or I or the vast majority of good red-blooded Americans, Alex, would ever dream of going along with.
[00:50:47.498 --> 00:50:49.420]  And they make the laws.
[00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:51.523]  And shall I describe how they do it?
[00:50:51.523 --> 00:50:53.785]  Because it is a fascinating process.
[00:50:53.785 --> 00:50:57.789]  And it starts by them meeting in secret.
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.521]  And directive, as you know, is the root of dictator.
[00:51:26.846 --> 00:51:27.426]  That's it.
[00:51:27.426 --> 00:51:33.690]  It is an instruction from our new masters on how we are to behave.
[00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:47.798]  And the so-called parliaments of the individual member states, like the Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Parliament, it is their duty to enact these directives into the law of the individual member states.
[00:51:47.798 --> 00:51:55.963]  And if they don't, then the government can be fined unlimited amounts of money by the commissars until they do comply.
[00:51:57.003 --> 00:52:03.110]  And so what happens is that the first stage of the law is directives proposed in secret.
[00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:14.863]  Then it is passed from the Commissars to another secret committee, indeed a committee so secret that until just a few months ago, its very existence was not even mentioned.
[00:52:15.403 --> 00:52:17.845]  On the European Union's own website.
[00:52:17.845 --> 00:52:20.727]  And this is the Committee of Permanent Representatives.
[00:52:20.727 --> 00:52:24.349]  By the very phrase permanent, you can tell that they're not elected.
[00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:27.171]  Because election is not a permanent state.
[00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:30.193]  But they are appointed bureaucrats.
[00:52:30.193 --> 00:52:31.674]  Nobody knows who they are.
[00:52:31.674 --> 00:52:38.498]  They meet in secret to do what you in Congress would call a mark-up, which is the detailed consideration of the legislation.
[00:52:38.498 --> 00:52:39.879]  And we would call the committee stage.
[00:52:40.797 --> 00:52:43.119]  And that, again, we would do it in public.
[00:52:43.119 --> 00:52:44.400]  You do it in public.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.541]  They do it in secret.
[00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:47.802]  And they are not elected to do it.
[00:52:47.802 --> 00:52:54.927]  Then it goes from them to, would you believe, a third body also meeting in secret.
[00:52:54.927 --> 00:52:56.909]  This one is called the Council of Ministers.
[00:52:56.909 --> 00:52:58.170]  You think, aren't ministers?
[00:52:58.170 --> 00:52:59.451]  Perhaps they're elected.
[00:52:59.451 --> 00:53:00.251]  Yes, they are.
[00:53:00.251 --> 00:53:02.313]  But they don't sit on the Council of Ministers.
[00:53:02.313 --> 00:53:04.034]  Well, not very often, anyway.
[00:53:04.034 --> 00:53:09.418]  Normally, the Council of Ministers is, you've guessed it, another group of unelected bureaucrats meeting
[00:53:09.958 --> 00:53:11.200]  We're good to go.
[00:53:24.443 --> 00:53:32.114]  If they say yes, then and only then, it is put in front of the only elected institution in Europe.
[00:53:32.114 --> 00:53:35.299]  This is the European Talking Shop, or it's called a parliament.
[00:53:35.299 --> 00:53:37.182]  That's a joke word for it, really.
[00:53:37.182 --> 00:53:39.505]  And the Talking Shop can express an opinion.
[00:53:40.086 --> 00:53:42.027]  But it cannot decide the legislation.
[00:53:42.027 --> 00:53:44.448]  It cannot either decide in favour or against.
[00:53:44.448 --> 00:53:46.550]  All it can do is express an opinion.
[00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:52.413]  If it says yes, then the legislation, even then, doesn't necessarily go through.
[00:53:52.413 --> 00:53:57.856]  Because the Commissars have been known to put forward kind of stalking horse legislation they don't want to go through.
[00:53:57.856 --> 00:54:00.977]  So then it goes through all these stages, wasting everybody's time.
[00:54:00.977 --> 00:54:06.300]  Then the Commissars say, we want to show who's boss, and we're going to not let that legislation proceed.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:09.462]  And so they can then overrule the European elections.
[00:54:09.762 --> 00:54:15.545]  And it goes on and on, but the reason this is important for people in North... I'm asking you the next stage.
[00:54:15.545 --> 00:54:16.146]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:54:16.146 --> 00:54:17.126]  One more stage.
[00:54:17.126 --> 00:54:22.089]  It then goes to the Parliament of the Member States for debate.
[00:54:22.089 --> 00:54:25.471]  But of course, we don't get debate in our Parliament on this.
[00:54:25.471 --> 00:54:36.177]  It goes to the Legislative Scrutiny Committee of the House of Commons, and you've guessed it, that's the only committee of the House of Commons that meets behind closed doors in secret.
[00:54:36.177 --> 00:54:37.778]  Now if you read the Madison Papers,
[00:54:38.318 --> 00:55:02.911]  And you see how insistent they were that the Congress that they created with Article 1, Section 1 of your great Constitution of Liberty, was to meet in public so that those who had elected the members of both houses of Congress, of course it was one house originally, but now both houses of Congress, could see what it was that those whom they had elected were doing and saying on their behalf.
[00:55:02.911 --> 00:55:07.314]  Democracy doesn't work unless legislation is considered in public.
[00:55:07.774 --> 00:55:15.240]  But every state of the legislation that is now imposed upon us from Europe is conducted in secret.
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:17.501]  Lord Monckton studying these systems.
[00:55:17.501 --> 00:55:21.705]  Is there not a continuity of agenda through the bureaucratic class?
[00:55:23.129 --> 00:55:23.650]  Yes, there is.
[00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:33.378]  I mean, it's very clear that the European model, which is tyranny by Clark, as we call it, is that's the model they're now going to try and spread worldwide.
[00:55:33.378 --> 00:55:35.280]  They've grown tired of democracy.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.845]  They don't like voters coming along and saying, we don't like the arrangements you have made for us.
[00:55:40.845 --> 00:55:42.506]  We want another lot to take charge.
[00:55:42.506 --> 00:55:43.267]  They hate that.
[00:55:43.934 --> 00:55:51.662]  They hate being thrown out after they've had all the trappings and motorcars and red boxes and everybody calling them Minister and Secretary of State.
[00:55:51.662 --> 00:55:53.083]  They love all that.
[00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:55.085]  And they don't like it taken away.
[00:55:55.085 --> 00:56:00.530]  And they realise the way to make sure it never gets taken away again is simply to take democracy away.
[00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:07.177]  And so the European Union was set up right from the start with elaborate care to make sure that at no point
[00:56:07.757 --> 00:56:11.700]  Did democracy get anywhere near the real decision-making?
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:33.859]  And so when it came to setting up the world government which the UN would like to set up to save the planet from supposed climate change, they used EU advisors and their fingers were all over the documents I read in Cancun last December at the latest round of this kind of rolling international conference they have.
[00:56:33.859 --> 00:56:34.780]  And it's quite clear
[00:56:35.646 --> 00:56:43.368]  That they've decided the way to go is the EU way, without even bothering to have the fig leaf of an elected parliament.
[00:56:43.368 --> 00:56:45.348]  They're not even going to have it as a fig leaf.
[00:56:45.348 --> 00:56:48.569]  It's going to be openly anti-democratic.
[00:56:48.569 --> 00:56:50.970]  And they reckon they're going to get away with it.
[00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:52.430]  Well, I reckon they're not.
[00:56:52.430 --> 00:57:01.832]  Because one of the things that's happening is that when I first began talking about world government, people said to me, oh yes, you're another world government conspiracy theorist.
[00:57:01.832 --> 00:57:02.813]  Pointy head.
[00:57:02.813 --> 00:57:04.273]  Don't you have more sense than that?
[00:57:05.093 --> 00:57:16.329]  So the first person that sent this to me was Kevin Libin, who was a journalist, a distinguished journalist actually, on the National Post in Canada, which is a very major newspaper.
[00:57:16.329 --> 00:57:20.135]  And I had been speaking to the Petroleum Club of Calgary about two years ago.
[00:57:20.735 --> 00:57:21.276]  Three years ago.
[00:57:21.276 --> 00:57:24.037]  And I said, this world government is coming.
[00:57:24.037 --> 00:57:25.578]  The treaty is already in draft.
[00:57:25.578 --> 00:57:28.960]  This was the draft Copenhagen treaty that eventually failed.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.302]  But I said, it's quite clear that what they want is world government.
[00:57:31.302 --> 00:57:33.463]  He came up after me and said, oh, world government, world government.
[00:57:33.463 --> 00:57:35.945]  This is not, you know, this is just a conspiracy theory.
[00:57:35.945 --> 00:57:37.646]  I said, I have three words for you, Kevin.
[00:57:37.646 --> 00:57:38.226]  He said, what?
[00:57:38.226 --> 00:57:40.168]  I said, read the treaty.
[00:57:41.269 --> 00:57:42.310]  She said, you mean there is one?
[00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.053]  I said, do you think I'd just sit here and make stuff up?
[00:57:45.053 --> 00:57:47.977]  So I sent him a copy of it, and an hour later he rang back.
[00:57:47.977 --> 00:57:50.700]  He said, this is ten times worse than you ever told me.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:57.949]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:01.332]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:58:01.332 --> 00:58:06.695]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:58:06.695 --> 00:58:09.757]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:58:09.757 --> 00:58:12.059]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:18.323]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:58:18.323 --> 00:58:21.705]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:58:21.705 --> 00:58:23.086]  Recently, he created a video
[00:58:23.226 --> 00:58:23.446]  We're good.
[00:58:50.647 --> 00:58:57.610]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:58:57.610 --> 00:59:00.251]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:02.672]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with EFOOTS Direct.
[00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:07.054]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:59:07.054 --> 00:59:08.535]  You must act automatically.
[00:59:08.775 --> 00:59:12.279]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:59:12.279 --> 00:59:15.042]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:59:15.042 --> 00:59:23.411]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:59:23.411 --> 00:59:26.194]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:59:26.434 --> 00:59:36.120]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:38.202]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:38.202 --> 00:59:40.703]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[00:59:51.502 --> 00:59:54.345]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[00:59:54.345 --> 00:59:58.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:05.558 --> 01:00:10.402]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.402 --> 01:00:11.983]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.525]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.525 --> 01:00:17.708]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:23.033]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:31.480]  Well, we were going to have Lord Mongeon for just 30 minutes, but he's graciously staying with us another 20 because I've got a bunch of questions we haven't even gotten into.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.522]  I constantly study the
[01:00:34.872 --> 01:00:46.177]  We've got megacorporations that are not free market teamed up with government bureaucracies trying to set up a mafia system where you've got to get an imperial seal from them to be able to do business.
[01:00:46.177 --> 01:00:47.138]  And that's what this is all about.
[01:00:47.138 --> 01:00:53.061]  So in the next segment we'll talk about the fact that they're down but they're not out, exposed by Climategate now two years ago.
[01:00:54.264 --> 01:01:01.212]  How they're trying to counter-strike back at the forces of liberty with literally the leading mind.
[01:01:01.212 --> 01:01:02.674]  And believe me, I do a lot of research, folks.
[01:01:02.674 --> 01:01:11.384]  He's the leading guy who's been 100% spot on in all his mathematical calculations on what he broke down about what were frauds the UN had put out.
[01:01:11.384 --> 01:01:13.366]  I mean, almost like he has a crystal ball.
[01:01:13.366 --> 01:01:14.467]  Lord Christopher Monckton.
[01:01:15.388 --> 01:01:16.990]  Eighteen months ago, Jason McGoldrick
[01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:43.445]  Who had gone over to Hungary to set up a company there, which had failed.
[01:01:43.445 --> 01:01:44.506]  Came back to the UK.
[01:01:44.506 --> 01:01:56.560]  A few months after that, the Serious Organized Crime Agency, that's RKGB, kicks down the door of his house at three in the morning.
[01:01:57.662 --> 01:02:02.843]  Took him away without telling his wife and family where they were taking him.
[01:02:02.843 --> 01:02:08.545]  Took him in front of a judge in London who had no power to stop what was happening next.
[01:02:08.545 --> 01:02:15.547]  And put him on a plane to Hungary at the request of the prosecuting authorities there who said they were ready to prosecute him for fraud.
[01:02:16.527 --> 01:02:22.831]  They, there was no hearing to discover whether there was any evidence against him before he was shipped off overseas.
[01:02:22.831 --> 01:02:33.757]  Habeas Corpus, which is written into Magna Carta, I was reading it in the original Latin only the other day, has now been taken away by this procedure called the European Arrest Warrant.
[01:02:33.757 --> 01:02:40.101]  He was flung into jail without his parents or anybody or his children knowing or his wife knowing where he was.
[01:02:40.101 --> 01:02:45.564]  He was fed on rancid pork fat three times a day, which is effectively torture.
[01:02:46.344 --> 01:02:52.386]  Under UK law, anyone who did that to you would be prosecuted for torture, and that's a very serious criminal offence.
[01:02:52.386 --> 01:02:59.649]  And he was kept there for four months, and he got in touch with a Conservative Member of the European Parliament.
[01:02:59.649 --> 01:03:05.251]  And now you'll know why I'm not a Conservative, because that Conservative Member of the European Parliament said to him, I don't care.
[01:03:06.171 --> 01:03:14.218]  Whether you say you're innocent or not, if one of our fellow governments in the European Union says you're guilty, that's enough for me.
[01:03:14.218 --> 01:03:16.881]  We don't need trials these days.
[01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:20.164]  And you can stay right where you are and I'm not lifting a finger to help you.
[01:03:21.144 --> 01:03:24.688]  And that was the extraordinary reply this man got, eventually, in prison.
[01:03:24.688 --> 01:03:32.978]  So he got in touch with my noble friend, the Earl of Dartmouth, who is a sitting member of the European Parliament, in the UKIP interest, United Kingdom Independence Party.
[01:03:32.978 --> 01:03:34.099]  He said to him, will you help?
[01:03:34.099 --> 01:03:39.926]  And Dartmouth got on the next plane, went to the prison, and got him out.
[01:03:39.926 --> 01:03:40.667]  And got him out.
[01:03:42.023 --> 01:03:43.664]  I've got to stop you, sir.
[01:03:43.664 --> 01:03:45.124]  Sir, I was not aware of this.
[01:03:45.124 --> 01:03:46.265]  I knew this was going on.
[01:03:46.265 --> 01:03:55.108]  I have seen on our local news, they bring Japanese police here and are signing deals to allow them to grab US citizens.
[01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:56.949]  They bring EU police here.
[01:03:56.949 --> 01:03:58.670]  They send our police there.
[01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:59.550]  It's unelected.
[01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:01.691]  There are no laws.
[01:04:01.691 --> 01:04:03.492]  They just do whatever they want.
[01:04:03.492 --> 01:04:05.833]  And this is this new world order system.
[01:04:06.823 --> 01:04:16.790]  Well, as long as it's a EU-UN member, you are now under their laws, and they're now saying Americans will be under the anti-free speech laws of Canada via this SPP.
[01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:31.380]  We're going to break, but I want to come back and give you the floor, because some stations don't carry this segment, to recap this story in great detail and get into it, because there's so many facets to this, and you bring them all up, and for those that aren't concerned,
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:52.046]  This is one of the main reasons we had 1776 in this country is because they had kangaroo courts and the king and bureaucrats would haul colonists, who were British citizens, onto boats and deprive them of English law and Magna Carta and take them to these kangaroo courts, sometimes in other possessions.
[01:04:52.046 --> 01:04:54.407]  I mean, this is as tyrannical as it gets.
[01:04:54.407 --> 01:04:57.148]  Lord Christopher Monckton, this is unbelievable.
[01:04:57.148 --> 01:04:59.689]  We're going to pull some news articles up on this when we come back.
[01:04:59.689 --> 01:05:00.169]  Unbelievable.
[01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:06.131]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:10.052]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:10.052 --> 01:05:12.294]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.294 --> 01:05:18.156]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.156 --> 01:05:24.819]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.819 --> 01:05:30.782]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.782 --> 01:05:34.504]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:05:34.984 --> 01:05:39.268]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:45.213]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.213 --> 01:05:48.775]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:48.775 --> 01:05:50.757]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:50.757 --> 01:05:51.878]  It's here.
[01:05:51.878 --> 01:05:58.684]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:06:01.966 --> 01:06:08.613]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:08.613 --> 01:06:20.624]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:20.624 --> 01:06:25.069]  By the way, Dr. Jerome Corsi's got a book coming out on Obama.
[01:06:27.196 --> 01:06:33.400]  And he's gone all over the world, Indonesia, Kenya, you name it, and they've expunged the records.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:39.444]  The one school record we got does confirm he changed his name to Barry Sotero, did give up his US citizenship.
[01:06:39.444 --> 01:06:45.449]  Well, that's all over the news today, but I just want to point out that Webster Tarpling, we carry both of his books, by the way,
[01:06:46.309 --> 01:07:01.958]  Reported this years ago and in total detail the full spectrum with Barack H Obama the unauthorized biography But going to Webster Griffin Tarpley, it was Tarpley Several months ago when the Libyan rebellion began that wrote the articles at Tarpley.net.
[01:07:01.958 --> 01:07:03.599]  We posted them at Infowars.com
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.240]  We're good to go.
[01:07:28.228 --> 01:07:30.050]  Then they're going to have to bring in a larger ground force.
[01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:45.203]  So, we've actually entered 1984, and there's a lot of mainstream news articles now admitting that the full ground invasion is on, with the UN ordering the United States to contribute troops, the Marine Corps ships that are already there, more getting into place.
[01:07:45.203 --> 01:07:47.064]  So, Webster Tarpley, a huge development.
[01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:50.047]  Over a month ago you said the Saudis are being double-crossed.
[01:07:50.647 --> 01:07:52.548]  The globalists are devaluing the dollar.
[01:07:52.548 --> 01:07:54.969]  This is a system to overthrow the entire Middle East.
[01:07:54.969 --> 01:08:00.992]  Now the Saudis, as you said months ago, except this last year, are running to the Russians, running to the Chinese.
[01:08:00.992 --> 01:08:06.434]  I mean, it's incredible, Dr. Tarpley of history and also an economist, that you broke all this down.
[01:08:06.434 --> 01:08:08.895]  Now it's all evident there.
[01:08:08.895 --> 01:08:10.236]  What does this signify?
[01:08:10.236 --> 01:08:16.759]  And there's also some mainstream articles today that the Arab Spring is not going completely well for the globalists.
[01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:18.765]  Precisely.
[01:08:18.765 --> 01:08:27.027]  The basic idea is that you had all of these countries, be it Libya, be it Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and others.
[01:08:27.027 --> 01:08:35.729]  Lots and lots of countries in the empire that were trying to get out from under this suffocating US-British IMF domination.
[01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:42.791]  And in order to do that, they were playing the Russian card, the China card, the Iranian card, or trying to build themselves up.
[01:08:42.791 --> 01:08:43.531]  The Brexit card!
[01:08:44.331 --> 01:08:48.494]  Um, BRICS is not quite going to do it, because it's a little bit heterogeneous.
[01:08:48.494 --> 01:08:50.015]  But yes, something like that.
[01:08:50.015 --> 01:08:56.079]  Individually, the BRICS, although the BRICS as an entity is not really coherent.
[01:08:56.079 --> 01:08:58.540]  But specifically now, the news is this.
[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.402]  Saudi Arabia, of course, is a huge target of
[01:09:01.682 --> 01:09:10.252]  They had to get Egypt out of the way to go into Libya to bring the weapons in.
[01:09:10.252 --> 01:09:12.875]  You said months ago Mubarak wasn't playing ball on that.
[01:09:12.875 --> 01:09:15.017]  Then Saudi Arabia, then Iran.
[01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:15.818]  It's the whole deal.
[01:09:16.459 --> 01:09:31.195]  Right now, here's what we've got, is an attempt by the Saudis to defend themselves, to maintain their national independence and to stop this tremendous CIA intervention and National Endowment for Democracy intervention into their internal affairs.
[01:09:31.195 --> 01:09:31.876]  At the end of March,
[01:09:32.797 --> 01:09:51.816]  We have Prince Bandar, the head of the National Security Council, and as far as I can see, the dominant personality of the whole regime, of the royal family, going to Pakistan and meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Gilani, but I'm sure also with the Pakistani army and the ISI.
[01:09:51.816 --> 01:09:55.920]  And the Washington Post has had a couple of freak-out articles about this, one by
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:58.362]  Martin Indyk, the former U.S.
[01:09:58.362 --> 01:09:59.603]  ambassador to Israel.
[01:09:59.603 --> 01:10:04.247]  This is a guy who, remember, is an Australian, nationalized here, very, very strange guy.
[01:10:04.247 --> 01:10:09.651]  The idea is that Prince Bandar has arranged that if the U.S.
[01:10:09.651 --> 01:10:18.199]  starts a color revolution inside the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Pakistanis will send a division or more of troops to put it down.
[01:10:18.599 --> 01:10:19.979]  There is a tradition for this.
[01:10:19.979 --> 01:10:33.023]  In the 1970s, 1980s, at various times, the Saudis kept a division of Pakistani troops inside Saudi Arabia for security, to put down any eventual rebellions.
[01:10:33.023 --> 01:10:38.144]  And those were the people, I think, that went into the holy places during the Hajj in 1978, 1979, when there were some violent incidents there.
[01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:53.811]  But you can see the idea that Bandar is turning to an alliance with Pakistan in order to defend Saudi Arabia against the U.S.
[01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:55.993]  is a kind of strategic revolution.
[01:10:55.993 --> 01:11:00.135]  Up to now, Saudi Arabia has relied on the United States for security.
[01:11:00.135 --> 01:11:06.939]  But now, the people around Bandar see, obviously, that Obama is the main threat, that the U.S.
[01:11:06.939 --> 01:11:07.299]  regime
[01:11:07.639 --> 01:11:14.380]  The CIA, the NED, are the main threat to the internal security of Saudi Arabia, so they're looking for an option.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:18.901]  Now, once you say Pakistan, of course, you're also saying nuclear weapons.
[01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:28.223]  You can say in a certain way, it's quite possible that Bandar has arranged that Saudi Arabia is now under the Pakistani nuclear umbrella.
[01:11:28.223 --> 01:11:31.583]  This is quite a new thing in world affairs.
[01:11:31.583 --> 01:11:35.424]  These are two countries, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, who have been under the U.S.
[01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:35.704]  yoke
[01:11:36.144 --> 01:11:41.647]  Totally dominated by the U.S., bombed in the case of Pakistan, who are trying to make a jailbreak.
[01:11:41.647 --> 01:11:57.296]  And because of globalist treachery, they were fully under the Anglo-American system, but because of the attempted overthrows and assassinations of Benazir Bhutto and others, and I've had the former head of Pakistani intelligence on confirming this, Hamid Gul, folks, doesn't get any more high-powered out of Pakistan.
[01:11:57.296 --> 01:11:59.357]  He concurs with what Dr. Tarpley is saying.
[01:11:59.717 --> 01:12:01.238]  They now know they've been double-crossed.
[01:12:01.238 --> 01:12:03.278]  The Saudis, and again, you said this last year.
[01:12:03.278 --> 01:12:06.940]  I'm blown away by your foresight.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.721]  They now admit they're being double-crossed.
[01:12:09.721 --> 01:12:15.342]  Same thing six months ago said by our oil company connections through Lindsey Williams.
[01:12:15.342 --> 01:12:27.667]  And so the globalists were attempting, through the RAND Corporation Brzezinski model, for a global destabilization from North Africa, Middle East, into Central Asia as a pretext to move giant forces in to then menace China and Russia.
[01:12:28.547 --> 01:12:31.529]  I mean, this is an incredibly bold move.
[01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:38.893]  Actually, the first attempt of Bandar, the first thing that at least I learned about, was in July of 2009.
[01:12:38.893 --> 01:12:44.276]  I was on your program to call attention to the fact that Bandar was playing the Russian card.
[01:12:44.276 --> 01:12:46.597]  He had made numerous visits to Russia.
[01:12:46.597 --> 01:12:47.978]  He had been meeting with Putin.
[01:12:47.978 --> 01:12:52.681]  They were talking about Russian military assistance, also there for Saudi Arabia.
[01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:58.965]  So that goes back almost two years, and in reality more, most likely.
[01:12:58.965 --> 01:13:06.209]  Since then, there was a period of about a year when Bondar disappeared from view, and we weren't exactly sure what had happened to him.
[01:13:06.209 --> 01:13:10.111]  But now the word in various publications is, Bondar is back.
[01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:20.538]  And I have to remind people, you may still have the idea that Bondar is this guy who's basically a slave of George Bush, the younger Bondar Bush, close friend of the Bush family.
[01:13:20.538 --> 01:13:22.599]  This is ultimately all irrelevant.
[01:13:22.879 --> 01:13:27.841]  He's a survivor, and now it's even in Reuters that the Saudis are saying they're being double-crossed.
[01:13:27.841 --> 01:13:30.922]  So he leaves house arrest, he's now back.
[01:13:30.922 --> 01:13:35.123]  Right, and the house arrest, we have to see whether that was really house arrest or not.
[01:13:35.123 --> 01:13:38.325]  But the idea now is that if the U.S.
[01:13:38.325 --> 01:13:42.486]  starts this color revolution, that there will be Pakistani assistance.
[01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:43.766]  Look at how the U.S.
[01:13:43.766 --> 01:13:45.027]  is attacking Saudi Arabia.
[01:13:45.607 --> 01:13:47.249]  One way is through Yemen.
[01:13:47.249 --> 01:13:50.852]  That entire thing in Yemen is basically a sideshow.
[01:13:50.852 --> 01:13:54.795]  The target of everything that happens in Yemen is Saudi Arabia.
[01:13:54.795 --> 01:14:07.747]  If you have the split up of Yemen, above all, the emergence of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, led by Shiri, a Guantanamo six-year alumnus brought in by the United States,
[01:14:08.167 --> 01:14:08.568]  And now the
[01:14:28.251 --> 01:14:31.055]  Well, that's even admitted in the LA Times and Washington Post.
[01:14:31.055 --> 01:14:33.538]  They're not even denying this.
[01:14:33.538 --> 01:14:35.380]  Brazenly, they think we're so done.
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:43.130]  They say bombs are humanitarian, ground troops are humanitarian, Al-Qaeda is bad when we say, good when we say, simultaneously.
[01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:46.475]  I mean, do you think they can really sell this to people?
[01:14:47.031 --> 01:14:48.912]  Well, they're trying hard.
[01:14:48.912 --> 01:14:51.632]  I just wanted to mention the other angle is Bahrain.
[01:14:51.632 --> 01:14:53.413]  Now, Bahrain is this island, right?
[01:14:53.413 --> 01:15:02.896]  It's one of these little emirates along what amounts to the coast of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Coast, the Persian Gulf, Arabian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia.
[01:15:02.896 --> 01:15:10.858]  Now, there we have the Saudi troops have intervened in support of the Sunni royal family against the Shiite
[01:15:11.579 --> 01:15:19.928]  This is obviously intended, not just, it's not really a destabilization of Bahrain because the 5th Fleet base is there.
[01:15:19.928 --> 01:15:25.915]  There is an angle of putting pressure on the Royal Family because they don't want the base to be used for a war with Iran.
[01:15:26.135 --> 01:15:27.255]  Well, Webster, I want to be clear.
[01:15:27.255 --> 01:15:28.296]  It's a soft underbelly.
[01:15:28.296 --> 01:15:29.356]  I want to be clear.
[01:15:29.356 --> 01:15:31.036]  And it's spread the contagion to Saudi Arabia.
[01:15:31.036 --> 01:15:34.878]  I can't stand the corrupt Saudis put in by British Intel a hundred plus years ago.
[01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:36.718]  I can't stand Qaddafi.
[01:15:36.718 --> 01:15:41.019]  The point is, why are the globalists moving against their allies, their old enemies?
[01:15:41.019 --> 01:15:44.721]  They now admit, it's all over the news, that they are destabilizing.
[01:15:44.721 --> 01:15:48.362]  And the Saudis respond by saying, we're going to slash oil production.
[01:15:48.362 --> 01:15:55.604]  And yes, two days after they met with Gates and tried to make a deal, the Secretary of Defense, they did run to Russia and China.
[01:15:56.084 --> 01:16:01.207]  And so this could be a big miscalculation by the Anglo-American globalist.
[01:16:01.207 --> 01:16:07.871]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:13.014]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:16:13.014 --> 01:16:21.738]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:16:21.738 --> 01:16:23.740]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:16:25.796 --> 01:16:26.837]  We're good to go.
[01:16:39.882 --> 01:16:42.024]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:16:42.024 --> 01:16:43.806]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.

[01:17:00.404 --> 01:17:04.967]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:17:04.967 --> 01:17:05.867]  Number 1.
[01:17:05.867 --> 01:17:09.290]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:10.150]  Number 2.
[01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:15.053]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:17:15.053 --> 01:17:15.794]  It's true.
[01:17:15.794 --> 01:17:20.657]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:17:20.657 --> 01:17:21.497]  Number 3.
[01:17:21.497 --> 01:17:25.080]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:28.782]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:29.782]  Number 4.
[01:17:29.782 --> 01:17:32.523]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:36.225]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:17:36.225 --> 01:17:37.005]  Number 5.
[01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:41.147]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:17:41.147 --> 01:17:46.209]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:50.370]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:52.171]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:17:58.034 --> 01:18:03.078]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:08.383]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:09.924]  Saving means to make money.
[01:18:09.924 --> 01:18:18.712]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:18:19.432 --> 01:18:26.974]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:18:26.974 --> 01:18:34.977]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:40.198]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:18:40.198 --> 01:18:42.359]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:05.208]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:08.451]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:19:08.451 --> 01:19:13.255]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:19:13.255 --> 01:19:19.661]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:19:19.661 --> 01:19:21.883]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:19:22.423 --> 01:19:23.904]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:19:23.904 --> 01:19:25.004]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:19:25.004 --> 01:19:27.425]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:43.191]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:48.613]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.

[01:20:03.156 --> 01:20:05.217]  Direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:08.418]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:30.410]  The idea I think is that these countries are targeted, not because of their internal regimes, and of course the Saudi internal regime is quite distasteful, to put it mildly.
[01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:36.152]  But the main issue is that they're attempting to rebel against Anglo-American domination.
[01:20:36.152 --> 01:20:39.013]  I think globalism is not exactly the right term.
[01:20:39.013 --> 01:20:39.873]  This is US-British
[01:20:40.253 --> 01:20:40.453]  Yeah.
[01:20:40.453 --> 01:20:45.077]  Well, Webster, we're gonna skip this network break, so stations should carry this, and I don't wanna get...
[01:20:58.749 --> 01:21:19.470]  Fighting going on here, but I really respect your foresight your understanding, but it's admitted now again We read three mainstream news articles yesterday La Times you name it admitting that okay the West did orchestrate this in Egypt in Libya in Syria the State Department admits I mean they're doing all of this and
[01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:20.371]  Yes.
[01:21:35.069 --> 01:21:37.491]  This was all a Western destabilization program.
[01:21:37.491 --> 01:21:41.433]  At the time it was admitted it was, he basically said it was a real revolution.
[01:21:41.433 --> 01:21:51.559]  Now, I understand that people have real reasons to be upset and the globalists recognize that climate politically and then triggered it, but it's not debatable that they've triggered it.
[01:21:51.559 --> 01:21:53.420]  And off air, you were mentioning that to me.
[01:21:53.420 --> 01:21:54.441]  Do you have any statements about it?
[01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:56.198]  Certainly.
[01:21:56.198 --> 01:22:03.680]  The thing that LaRouche was saying was that this was all genuine and spontaneous, and I think that is absolutely wrong.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.001]  The grievances are real.
[01:22:06.001 --> 01:22:13.823]  The potential was real, just as the potential under Metternich in Europe in 1848 was real.
[01:22:13.823 --> 01:22:19.204]  But the detonation, and then the shaping, the leadership, the program,
[01:22:20.024 --> 01:22:26.791]  And the general direction of these things is totally provided by the CIA, MI6, and NED.
[01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:29.314]  I thought it was interesting when you asked LaRouche that.
[01:22:29.314 --> 01:22:30.816]  He immediately dodged the question.
[01:22:30.816 --> 01:22:34.620]  He said, the only thing I can say about it is it's all totally spontaneous.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.841]  And in 1782, the King of France made a mistake.
[01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:51.146]  Now, the 1782 King of France made the mistake actually leads to an argument that the French Revolution was actually a destabilization of France provoked and promoted by
[01:22:51.226 --> 01:22:51.766]  The British.
[01:23:13.175 --> 01:23:14.376]  Uh, you know, was never an issue.
[01:23:14.376 --> 01:23:17.418]  That's just a, a, a, a, a modern fiction.
[01:23:17.418 --> 01:23:24.602]  But the British were in there openly manipulating the South and then stationing troops in Canada, threatening to invade.
[01:23:24.602 --> 01:23:25.923]  That's all mainline history.
[01:23:25.923 --> 01:23:29.145]  This is the grand stratagem great game.
[01:23:29.145 --> 01:23:29.385]  Right.
[01:23:29.385 --> 01:23:39.191]  And now I was actually talking about, about the French Revolution, not, not so much the American Civil War, but... No, I know, but I, I, I mentioned the French and then I shifted gears into the, uh, yeah.
[01:23:39.651 --> 01:23:51.758]  Yes, and of course, the Confederate States of America was a project that was detonated and promoted by Lord Palmerston, Lord John Muscle, British Intelligence, and so forth.
[01:23:51.758 --> 01:23:55.120]  Support for this, in a certain way, comes from unexpected quarters.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.363]  Jeff Steinberg, that you recently had on your program, has been following Bandar for two years.
[01:24:00.363 --> 01:24:06.527]  Back in July of 2009, when Bandar was playing the Russian card and beginning this attempt
[01:24:06.827 --> 01:24:09.409]  To free Saudi Arabia from total U.S.
[01:24:09.409 --> 01:24:11.030]  domination.
[01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:19.997]  This is precisely the moment that Steinberg chose to attack Bandar for various issues about scandals and 9-11 and so forth.
[01:24:19.997 --> 01:24:24.581]  Really, those pretexts meaning not very much, but mainly the idea, attack Bandar.
[01:24:24.581 --> 01:24:34.068]  And now precisely at the time when Bandar is preparing his trip to Pakistan, which really means an opening to China, we have Steinberg again attacking him.
[01:24:34.889 --> 01:24:43.300]  In the pages of that magazine, in this case it's an article that says the two worst guys in the Middle East are Bandar and Gaddafi.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:44.782]  Now isn't that interesting?
[01:24:44.782 --> 01:24:50.650]  This coincides precisely with the two main people that the US and the British are concerned about.
[01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:51.891]  In the region.
[01:24:51.891 --> 01:24:55.535]  So that's a very, very interesting pattern that we have there.
[01:24:55.535 --> 01:24:58.177]  But the general idea I think is clear.
[01:24:58.177 --> 01:25:03.002]  If Bandar goes to Pakistan, this is a little bit like Nixon going to China, right?
[01:25:03.002 --> 01:25:05.465]  The way you go to China is sometimes through Pakistan.
[01:25:05.465 --> 01:25:07.107]  That's how Nixon did it 40 years ago.
[01:25:07.107 --> 01:25:10.130]  Maybe that's how Bandar is doing it in a certain sense.
[01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:17.898]  Once you're in an alliance with Pakistan, you're also then connected to Pakistan's ally, China.
[01:25:17.898 --> 01:25:22.624]  And I would assume that Bandar has kept up his connections to Putin and to Russia.
[01:25:22.624 --> 01:25:27.269]  Now this gives us Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China.
[01:25:27.269 --> 01:25:29.151]  Now that's a coherent alliance.
[01:25:29.611 --> 01:25:36.036]  That's a step beyond the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and certainly way beyond the Brits.
[01:25:36.036 --> 01:25:46.405]  The Brits that have just been meeting, that's an interesting group, but in terms of strategy, you've got the fact that India, sitting right in the middle, is essentially an ally of the U.S.
[01:25:46.405 --> 01:25:52.150]  against China, so they may agree economically, but strategically, I don't see how they will.
[01:25:52.150 --> 01:25:58.435]  If we have Russia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and China, that could become something that would be strategic and military,
[01:25:58.835 --> 01:26:01.538]  But it could also become monetary and economic.
[01:26:01.538 --> 01:26:06.003]  That is an alliance with real world-shaping potential.
[01:26:06.003 --> 01:26:11.389]  And again, it's much stronger than these sort of things that we've seen so far.
[01:26:11.389 --> 01:26:16.795]  Now, we are seeing press reports admitting that the West is involved in all this, but that it's not going well.
[01:26:16.795 --> 01:26:18.938]  How do you see this ending right now?
[01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:24.092]  Well, let me just... One other scenario is this guy Michael Shoyer from the CIA, of course.
[01:26:24.092 --> 01:26:26.794]  CIA veteran, was the Bin Laden desk.
[01:26:26.794 --> 01:26:30.376]  I've always called him the head of the Bin Laden fan club in Langley.
[01:26:30.376 --> 01:26:37.080]  He's on television saying that if the Saudis crack down in Bahrain and start killing Shiites,
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:47.231]  Then the Iranians will invade Bahrain and essentially be at war with Saudi Arabia and therefore the US will have to intervene against Iran.
[01:26:52.797 --> 01:26:53.898]  You can see what he's doing.
[01:26:53.898 --> 01:26:59.621]  He's speaking very bluntly, but the whole idea of this is to scare Saudi Arabia back onto the plantation, right?
[01:26:59.621 --> 01:27:01.543]  Back onto the U.S.
[01:27:01.543 --> 01:27:04.544]  imperial ship.
[01:27:04.544 --> 01:27:16.772]  The thing in Libya that you've been mentioning in the news this morning is that British, French, and Italian advisors are going to be present on the ground in Libya with this al-Qaeda infantry, right?
[01:27:16.772 --> 01:27:17.993]  But they've always been there.
[01:27:17.993 --> 01:27:19.414]  Now they're beefing the force up.
[01:27:19.414 --> 01:27:19.734]  Right.
[01:27:20.498 --> 01:27:21.038]  Precisely.
[01:27:21.038 --> 01:27:22.700]  Now they're going to be there openly.
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:28.164]  They've been there for six or seven weeks since probably the middle of February and even earlier.
[01:27:28.164 --> 01:27:30.386]  So this looks like Mission Creep.
[01:27:30.386 --> 01:27:31.647]  Very interesting anniversary.
[01:27:31.647 --> 01:27:34.929]  We just had the 50th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs.
[01:27:34.929 --> 01:27:36.351]  And it's exactly parallel.
[01:27:36.351 --> 01:27:42.996]  Except that when Alan Dulles and his crackpots of the CIA invaded Cuba in April of 1961,
[01:27:44.777 --> 01:27:51.963]  When the first phase failed, when the irregular forces failed to get an insurrection in Cuba,
[01:27:52.682 --> 01:28:05.229]  Kennedy was then asked by Allen Dulles, you know, we need air support, we need actual invasion with Marines, and Kennedy said to him, no, I'm not giving you the air support, I'm not giving you the Marines, and by the way, you're fired.
[01:28:05.229 --> 01:28:06.389]  That was a real president.
[01:28:06.389 --> 01:28:18.176]  Well, it came out even on Nightline, excuse me, Frontline, that they fired him, he fired that whole group when they brought him northwards and said, let's stage terror attacks and blame it on Cuba to invade.
[01:28:18.636 --> 01:28:25.159]  Right, a number of causes, but certainly within, what, a year after the Bay of Pigs, Alan Dulles was out on his ear.
[01:28:25.159 --> 01:28:28.560]  Tremendous hatred in the CIA for Kennedy ever since.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.361]  But what happens now, in this case, Libya is the same example.
[01:28:31.361 --> 01:28:41.705]  You've got a secret army, in this case stashed by al-Qaeda terrorists, that you've released from Guantanamo, and they failed to overwhelm Qaddafi.
[01:28:41.705 --> 01:28:42.425]  So now we have
[01:28:42.605 --> 01:28:47.429]  The second phase, what you never saw in the Bay of Pigs, you are seeing now.
[01:28:47.429 --> 01:28:55.997]  You are seeing the mission creep that happens when you don't have a real president, and the CIA comes back and says, look, our secret army is not working.
[01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:57.799]  We need boots on the ground.
[01:28:57.799 --> 01:28:58.419]  We need airstrikes.
[01:28:58.419 --> 01:28:59.340]  We need all this stuff.
[01:29:01.084 --> 01:29:08.027]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:29:08.027 --> 01:29:10.668]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:29:10.668 --> 01:29:13.109]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:17.491]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:29:17.491 --> 01:29:18.972]  You must act automatically.
[01:29:19.212 --> 01:29:22.717]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:29:22.717 --> 01:29:25.480]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:33.851]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:29:33.851 --> 01:29:36.635]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:29:36.855 --> 01:29:46.542]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:30:01.834 --> 01:30:02.814]  He's usually right.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:28.284]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.284 --> 01:30:31.646]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:31.646 --> 01:30:37.429]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:30:37.429 --> 01:30:39.070]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.070 --> 01:30:40.370]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:30:40.370 --> 01:30:42.892]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.052 --> 01:30:47.255]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:31:01.445 --> 01:31:03.167]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:08.473]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:31:08.473 --> 01:31:10.015]  Saving means to make money.
[01:31:10.015 --> 01:31:18.805]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:31:19.526 --> 01:31:27.070]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:35.074]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:31:35.074 --> 01:31:40.297]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[01:32:00.967 --> 01:32:16.453]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:32:16.453 --> 01:32:20.115]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:21.144 --> 01:32:33.918]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:32:33.918 --> 01:32:41.185]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:32:41.866 --> 01:32:52.232]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:32:56.155 --> 01:33:01.698]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:01.698 --> 01:33:03.239]  Coast to Coast.
[01:33:03.239 --> 01:33:05.301]  Direct from Austin.
[01:33:05.301 --> 01:33:08.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:14.941 --> 01:33:25.519]  I remember, I remember when I lost my mind There was something so pleasant about that place Even your emotions had an echo in so much space
[01:33:37.762 --> 01:33:41.364]  We're going to Gerald Solente for the balance of the hour.
[01:33:41.364 --> 01:33:43.605]  He may go a little bit into overdrive if he can do it.
[01:33:43.605 --> 01:33:45.206]  I haven't asked him yet.
[01:33:45.206 --> 01:33:48.508]  Before we go back to him, I want to give you a few program notes.
[01:33:48.508 --> 01:33:54.331]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers and InfoWars.com readers, there's a new article.
[01:33:55.251 --> 01:33:56.432]  We're good to go.
[01:34:11.087 --> 01:34:17.492]  Yesterday morning, we put out a video that's got more honors than any recent video we've put out.
[01:34:17.492 --> 01:34:26.818]  It's got more than 20 honors all over the world, and is one of the top videos on the front page of YouTube right now, approaching 100,000 views in one day.
[01:34:26.818 --> 01:34:29.781]  So that means it'll probably get about a million in the next month.
[01:34:29.781 --> 01:34:32.383]  And it's titled, Alex Jones Joins the New World Order.
[01:34:33.243 --> 01:34:38.645]  And it says at the bottom of the video that it's satire, and it's clearly satire.
[01:34:38.645 --> 01:34:43.826]  And some of my detractors, of course, have picked it up and say it's real.
[01:34:43.826 --> 01:34:45.027]  They know it's not real.
[01:34:45.027 --> 01:34:46.947]  They're going after weak-minded people.
[01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.888]  I didn't join the New World Order.
[01:34:48.888 --> 01:34:49.568]  It's satire.
[01:34:50.188 --> 01:35:02.259]  But if you want to see what I'm talking about, it's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or just go to our YouTube channel by clicking the links that are on the top of every article to go to our YouTube channel and you can watch it there.
[01:35:02.259 --> 01:35:04.721]  It's called Censored Video because it's satire.
[01:35:04.721 --> 01:35:12.068]  Censored Video, Alex Jones joins the New World Order if you want to see that viral video.
[01:35:12.068 --> 01:35:14.450]  Before we go to Gerald, a few of the sponsors that have made today's
[01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:16.211]  Radio show possible.

[01:36:02.353 --> 01:36:03.534]  25 years.
[01:36:03.534 --> 01:36:04.235]  Made in America.
[01:36:04.235 --> 01:36:05.576]  Regular jeans.
[01:36:05.576 --> 01:36:06.317]  They're high quality.
[01:36:06.317 --> 01:36:07.738]  They last longer than regular jeans.

[01:37:06.932 --> 01:37:12.614]  Okay, shifting gears now to Gerald Solente.
[01:37:12.614 --> 01:37:23.418]  And Gerald Solente is one of the leading, if not the leading, long-term trend forecasters.
[01:37:23.418 --> 01:37:28.460]  And he said, early last year, he said by the end of 2010, the U.S.
[01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:30.841]  will be technically bankrupt and will be in a depression.
[01:37:32.668 --> 01:37:37.830]  Most of the other economists and analysts we interviewed at that time said, yes, we are now at the point of no return.
[01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:39.450]  The dollar has been devalued.
[01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:41.171]  Commodities are going up.
[01:37:41.171 --> 01:37:42.471]  We never left the recession.
[01:37:42.471 --> 01:37:44.352]  We're in a depression.
[01:37:44.352 --> 01:37:54.796]  But we're now under 21st century mind control, where they tell us the economy's rebounded and is great, even though S&P has come out and said that it's a negative outlook on the U.S.
[01:37:54.796 --> 01:37:56.136]  keeping its credit rating.
[01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:57.757]  We'll basically become like a third world nation.
[01:37:58.317 --> 01:38:01.843]  The Chinese are dumping the dollar at record rates.
[01:38:01.843 --> 01:38:07.833]  The Saudis know they've been double-crossed with the attempted military overthrow by the globalists there and surrounding them, so they've said...
[01:38:10.748 --> 01:38:15.231]  That demand is low, so they're cutting production when demand's at an all-time high.
[01:38:15.231 --> 01:38:21.534]  There's no doubt we're in the first stages of a serious economic depression, and General Cilente was right.
[01:38:21.534 --> 01:38:26.918]  But, it's just like people send me emails and media makes jokes, Jones says buy gold.
[01:38:26.918 --> 01:38:27.518]  What a kook!
[01:38:27.518 --> 01:38:28.699]  They actually say this.
[01:38:28.699 --> 01:38:30.079]  He first said buy it at $2.60, now it's $1,510.
[01:38:32.961 --> 01:38:37.064]  He said buy silver when it was 5, now it's 46 plus.
[01:38:37.064 --> 01:38:43.189]  It's like saying, man, this guy, you know, told you your house was on fire and it was on fire.
[01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:44.270]  He's a nut.
[01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:54.117]  I mean, we've entered a la-la land world where they tell us the war in Libya isn't a war, ground troops on the ground isn't a ground war, and there won't be a ground war, though they say it's a ground war.
[01:38:54.938 --> 01:38:57.279]  But it isn't a ground war.
[01:38:57.279 --> 01:39:09.927]  They've raised the radiation levels between 1,000 to 100,000 times what they say was safe previously, because we have over 500 times safe levels in cesium, cesium, and radioactive iodine-131.
[01:39:09.927 --> 01:39:21.294]  We are now entering a la-la land Orwellville that is so bizarre, where they knowingly think the public's dumbed down and continue to tell us
[01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:24.612]  That up is down, down is up, black is white.
[01:39:24.612 --> 01:39:27.693]  Gerald Cilente, how do you quantify what's happening?
[01:39:27.693 --> 01:39:30.555]  Is civilization gone crazy?
[01:39:30.555 --> 01:39:34.698]  Everything is the presidential reality show.
[01:39:34.698 --> 01:39:36.319]  People have lost their minds.
[01:39:36.319 --> 01:39:42.943]  They become prescription drug addicted and fast food fattened.
[01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:45.365]  America doesn't have a fight anymore.
[01:39:45.365 --> 01:39:48.687]  As I mentioned to you, you know, people say, oh, you're a gloom and doomer.
[01:39:49.247 --> 01:39:55.332]  I came out with Trends 2000, my book, back in 1997.
[01:39:55.332 --> 01:39:56.733]  A Warner book.
[01:39:56.733 --> 01:39:59.396]  And I was so optimistic about the nation.
[01:39:59.396 --> 01:40:03.239]  People were talking about moving forward in positive ways.
[01:40:03.239 --> 01:40:06.362]  And as you said, up is down and down is up.
[01:40:06.362 --> 01:40:10.085]  They don't call a war in Libya a war.
[01:40:10.085 --> 01:40:13.308]  It's a time-limited, scope-limited action.
[01:40:13.928 --> 01:40:20.533]  The UK is now sending over, quote, advisors and Italy and France officers.
[01:40:20.533 --> 01:40:22.354]  You know, what am I, six years old?
[01:40:22.354 --> 01:40:23.955]  And they were already there months ago.
[01:40:23.955 --> 01:40:25.617]  They were there before it started.
[01:40:25.617 --> 01:40:27.698]  Well, I know, but now they're admitting it.
[01:40:27.698 --> 01:40:30.680]  But they're putting these white shoe boy names on them.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:32.102]  You know, advisors.
[01:40:32.102 --> 01:40:34.323]  That's what they call the Vietnam War.
[01:40:34.323 --> 01:40:36.245]  Hey, remember Korean War?
[01:40:36.245 --> 01:40:37.786]  That was a police action.
[01:40:38.246 --> 01:40:41.428]  You know, nothing's really changed, it's only getting worse.
[01:40:41.428 --> 01:40:47.271]  And as you're talking about the economy, you know, I read something from Jim Sinclair, he really put it well.
[01:40:47.271 --> 01:40:55.556]  He said something to the effect of Orwell's 1984, you know, how they used to keep blasting out these messages and putting them on the big screen.
[01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:58.898]  He said, now, you know, the business networks are the 1984, putting out the propaganda.
[01:41:01.659 --> 01:41:03.180]  And that's all it is.
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:06.723]  It's more propaganda on top of all propaganda.
[01:41:06.723 --> 01:41:09.024]  They won't call a spade a spade.
[01:41:09.024 --> 01:41:18.031]  Everybody knows that the only reason that this economy is keeping up at any level at all is because of all the digital money that they've dumped into the system.
[01:41:18.031 --> 01:41:19.172]  The trillions.
[01:41:19.172 --> 01:41:20.373]  Look what gold is doing.
[01:41:20.373 --> 01:41:22.194]  You mentioned I called gold a 275.
[01:41:22.194 --> 01:41:22.774]  You called it a 260.
[01:41:25.356 --> 01:41:26.437]  And look where it is now.
[01:41:26.437 --> 01:41:29.759]  Oh, and by the way, here's one for you.
[01:41:29.759 --> 01:41:32.401]  Go to Forbes Magazine.
[01:41:32.401 --> 01:41:34.082]  They did a big story on me.
[01:41:34.082 --> 01:41:34.922]  You know what they called it?
[01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:39.205]  They called it something about doomsayers forecasting.
[01:41:39.205 --> 01:41:45.229]  And we had forecast at that time gold was around $720 an ounce.
[01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:51.213]  They interviewed my assistant, but when she came to work for us, her bond company went bust.
[01:41:51.213 --> 01:41:54.976]  She cashed out all her 401ks and put it into gold.
[01:41:55.817 --> 01:41:59.643]  And then, now remember, gold is about $7.25 at the time.
[01:41:59.643 --> 01:42:02.527]  It's more than doubled since then a few years ago.
[01:42:02.527 --> 01:42:03.589]  Exactly.
[01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:04.871]  So now they write this.
[01:42:05.871 --> 01:42:13.358]  Well, you know, Salenti's a doom and gloomer, and gold could go down as easily go down below five bucks.
[01:42:13.358 --> 01:42:14.539]  No, that's what I'm saying!
[01:42:14.539 --> 01:42:17.402]  We're bad because we're right!
[01:42:17.402 --> 01:42:27.132]  So now we contacted these little weasels that Forbes, this guy would be nothing if his daddy didn't have any money, right?
[01:42:27.132 --> 01:42:29.254]  Now, you know, he's the big mouth out there.
[01:42:29.594 --> 01:42:31.957]  Do you know they won't even write a retraction?
[01:42:31.957 --> 01:42:34.200]  They won't even say that we're right.
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:43.031]  After they took a cheap shot at me, that flabbermouth out there, he's all over the place, select he was right, Forbes is wrong.
[01:43:00.947 --> 01:43:05.510]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:06.410]  Number 1.
[01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:09.853]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:09.853 --> 01:43:10.713]  Number 2.
[01:43:10.713 --> 01:43:15.596]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:43:15.596 --> 01:43:16.337]  It's true.
[01:43:16.337 --> 01:43:21.220]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:22.040]  Number 3.
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.623]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:25.623 --> 01:43:29.325]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:29.525 --> 01:43:30.325]  Number 4.
[01:43:30.325 --> 01:43:33.087]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:33.087 --> 01:43:36.768]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.

[01:45:07.749 --> 01:45:10.390]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:12.830]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:17.212]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:45:17.212 --> 01:45:18.912]  You must act automatically.
[01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:22.413]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:45:22.413 --> 01:45:24.854]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:45:25.194 --> 01:45:33.544]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:45:33.544 --> 01:45:36.588]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.

[01:46:04.514 --> 01:46:05.755]  Tyranny is here.
[01:46:05.755 --> 01:46:09.637]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:46:09.637 --> 01:46:11.918]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:46:11.918 --> 01:46:17.801]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:46:17.801 --> 01:46:24.044]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:46:24.464 --> 01:46:30.408]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:46:30.408 --> 01:46:34.611]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:46:34.611 --> 01:46:38.914]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:46:38.914 --> 01:46:44.859]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:46:44.859 --> 01:46:48.421]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:46:48.421 --> 01:46:50.382]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:46:50.382 --> 01:46:50.823]  It's here.

[01:47:20.731 --> 01:47:24.597]  March, the Empire is on the run.
[01:47:24.597 --> 01:47:28.302]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:41.490]  Look at the numbers.
[01:47:41.490 --> 01:47:45.913]  Home real estate values are down to worse than Great Depression levels.
[01:47:45.913 --> 01:47:48.074]  How's that for a Depression-era level?
[01:47:48.074 --> 01:47:51.036]  Go to John Williams' shadow statistics.
[01:47:51.036 --> 01:47:52.997]  Look up the unemployment rate.
[01:47:52.997 --> 01:47:53.598]  It's around 22%.
[01:47:53.598 --> 01:47:57.100]  Here, try this one on, Alex.
[01:47:57.100 --> 01:47:58.661]  Yeah, there's a recovery.
[01:47:58.661 --> 01:48:00.242]  You know where the recovery's coming from?
[01:48:00.242 --> 01:48:05.945]  10% of the population in the United States owns 90% of all the stocks
[01:48:08.727 --> 01:48:16.529]  All the bonds, all the mutual funds, 5% on 63% of everything.
[01:48:16.529 --> 01:48:18.789]  No, there's not a depression.
[01:48:18.789 --> 01:48:24.450]  Oh, in the meanwhile out there, everybody's wages have declined.
[01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:27.091]  Oh, but there's not inflation out there.
[01:48:27.091 --> 01:48:29.491]  Oh no, they cooked those numbers too.
[01:48:29.491 --> 01:48:31.952]  Of course there's a depression going on.
[01:48:31.952 --> 01:48:33.552]  People are losing everything.
[01:48:33.552 --> 01:48:34.212]  All right, I want to go back.
[01:48:34.352 --> 01:48:41.476]  Because you can always remember what journal, what date, and people can go to your website and pull it up and see it for themselves.
[01:48:41.476 --> 01:48:52.081]  But I remember over a year ago, because it was early 2010, you said it's going to be clear that it's a depression by the end of the year, and it's clear a few months ago.
[01:48:52.081 --> 01:48:59.145]  And you said there's going to be war, and it's going to be in the Middle East, it's going to be in Central Asia, and you absolutely called it.
[01:48:59.145 --> 01:49:00.526]  What journal was that?
[01:49:00.526 --> 01:49:02.287]  So people can go to Trends Research.
[01:49:03.027 --> 01:49:08.568]  The Spring 2010 Trends Journal, it was the Great War.
[01:49:08.568 --> 01:49:14.430]  And then this past autumn we came out with Off With Their Heads 2.0.
[01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:22.472]  And the Trends Journal, it just came out yesterday, the whole issue is devoted to the First Great War
[01:49:23.052 --> 01:49:25.354]  of the 21st century.
[01:49:25.354 --> 01:49:34.220]  You put all the pieces together, Alex, when you're talking about the police state we're living in, because they know it's happening.
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:40.324]  It's out of control, and the last thing they're going to do is to control us.
[01:49:40.324 --> 01:49:42.585]  That's all the plan.
[01:49:42.585 --> 01:49:44.747]  Look, Libya's not a one-off.
[01:49:45.532 --> 01:49:54.615]  Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Yemen, Algeria, Morocco, Syria, Jordan... How did you know?
[01:49:54.615 --> 01:49:56.495]  How did you know?
[01:49:56.495 --> 01:49:59.136]  Because the whole... You know how I know?
[01:49:59.136 --> 01:50:01.997]  For the same reason Bernie Madoff knew.
[01:50:01.997 --> 01:50:06.938]  Bernie Madoff did an interview recently and he said what we've been saying all along.
[01:50:08.516 --> 01:50:11.679]  It's nothing more than one big Ponzi scheme.
[01:50:11.679 --> 01:50:17.283]  When they came out with the TARP bailouts in 2008, we sent out a trend alert.
[01:50:17.283 --> 01:50:23.428]  And we said in that trend alert that when all else fails, they take you to war!
[01:50:24.389 --> 01:50:26.390]  That's what's going on.
[01:50:26.390 --> 01:50:29.511]  They can't bail out any more European banks.
[01:50:29.511 --> 01:50:31.711]  Oh, and by the way, this hardly made the news.
[01:50:31.711 --> 01:50:35.292]  As you know, Finland just voted in a new party.
[01:50:35.292 --> 01:50:37.733]  They're not going to be party to the bailouts.
[01:50:37.733 --> 01:50:43.275]  If all the European nations, the EMU nations, don't go into the bailouts, it doesn't happen.
[01:50:43.695 --> 01:50:45.817]  What's a bailout, by the way?
[01:50:45.817 --> 01:50:47.279]  Oh, here's a bailout for you.
[01:50:47.279 --> 01:50:48.140]  What bailout?
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:49.881]  How about bailing in?
[01:50:49.881 --> 01:50:52.504]  They give you more debt.
[01:50:52.504 --> 01:50:54.706]  They cannot handle the debt load.
[01:50:54.706 --> 01:51:00.772]  Well, the bankers get the money, and then we get to pay them interest for the right to give them money.
[01:51:00.772 --> 01:51:02.634]  That's how sick this is.
[01:51:02.634 --> 01:51:05.076]  The Wall Street Journal reports today a 77% profit.
[01:51:07.859 --> 01:51:07.899]  In
[01:51:23.908 --> 01:51:32.073]  Scapegoating the middle class, Alex Jones, Gerald Solente, you know, doctors, lawyers, professors.
[01:51:32.073 --> 01:51:39.417]  We're being scapegoated and told we've got to pay more to quote fix the debt, but the money that we pay goes right to the bankers.
[01:51:40.117 --> 01:51:46.423]  Exactly, and that's why we came off with their heads transjournal.
[01:51:46.423 --> 01:51:48.825]  And that's what's going on in Europe.
[01:51:48.825 --> 01:51:59.013]  The only reason why Europe hasn't imploded yet, like the Middle East, is because there, in the Middle East, people have their autocrats, the monarchs, the dictators.
[01:52:01.255 --> 01:52:07.723]  Europe, they're still living under the illusion that they have a democracy.
[01:52:07.723 --> 01:52:14.410]  So like in Ireland, they just put in another criminal group to replace the other criminal group.
[01:52:14.410 --> 01:52:17.133]  They're still living under the illusion
[01:52:17.894 --> 01:52:20.818]  That you can change it in the ballot box.
[01:52:20.818 --> 01:52:21.639]  Let me stop you.
[01:52:21.639 --> 01:52:24.883]  The system knows the illusion is wearing thin.
[01:52:24.883 --> 01:52:28.828]  And so now everything we've told people about, because it was public, is now being announced.
[01:52:28.828 --> 01:52:33.374]  Not just Apple, all smartphones under federal law, Telecommunications Act of 96.
[01:52:34.776 --> 01:52:36.638]  Track you in real time.
[01:52:36.638 --> 01:52:38.179]  Upload your location.
[01:52:38.179 --> 01:52:39.260]  Give them all your data.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:44.004]  Police all over the country have wireless systems with back doors.
[01:52:44.004 --> 01:52:44.884]  They don't even hack it.
[01:52:44.884 --> 01:52:47.547]  They get into your phone and steal everything off of it.
[01:52:47.547 --> 01:52:48.447]  They're just doing it.
[01:52:48.447 --> 01:52:49.788]  They pull you over for speeding.
[01:52:50.649 --> 01:52:52.530]  Grab your phone without a warrant.
[01:52:52.530 --> 01:52:53.591]  Plug it in.
[01:52:53.591 --> 01:52:54.531]  Steal your data.
[01:52:54.531 --> 01:52:56.953]  TSA doing the same thing when you try to fly.
[01:52:56.953 --> 01:52:59.294]  Steal your laptop data.
[01:52:59.294 --> 01:53:02.836]  I mean, they are so criminal, Gerald.
[01:53:02.836 --> 01:53:07.839]  And you go back last year, Bloomberg reports, 11 years ago, secret deal signed, Veterans Affairs.
[01:53:08.439 --> 01:53:15.266]  With the big insurance companies to secretly steal the life insurance money of World War II vets through current vets.
[01:53:15.266 --> 01:53:28.559]  I mean, to even get my mind around how unbelievably criminal they are and that they've been authorized to do it, it staggers the imagination that they're going for broke.
[01:53:28.559 --> 01:53:31.142]  They've committed so many crimes, Gerald, they're not going to stop.
[01:53:32.199 --> 01:53:43.715]  Alex, you know that I was one of the first people, when they started all these bailouts under Bush, and then continued under Obama, and they call it socialism and Marxism.
[01:53:43.715 --> 01:53:45.076]  I said, no it's not.
[01:53:45.076 --> 01:53:46.078]  It's fascism.
[01:53:47.039 --> 01:53:49.441]  Fascism has come to America.
[01:53:49.441 --> 01:53:52.024]  The merger of state and corporate powers.
[01:53:52.024 --> 01:53:53.826]  You just talked about GE.
[01:53:53.826 --> 01:53:56.589]  Do you have to go any further than that?
[01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:58.691]  You could keep going down the line.
[01:53:58.691 --> 01:54:06.198]  You're talking about all the apps and everything else with how the companies are all working in tandem together to rob us.
[01:54:06.198 --> 01:54:08.721]  Fascism has come to America.
[01:54:08.721 --> 01:54:10.022]  Here, try this one on.
[01:54:11.386 --> 01:54:20.595]  I unilaterally decided that our core interests and that of our allies are at stake.
[01:54:20.595 --> 01:54:23.898]  So we're going to bomb Libya.
[01:54:23.898 --> 01:54:26.000]  Whatever happened to we the people?
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.863]  That's a really, you know, an arcane concept.
[01:54:28.863 --> 01:54:29.924]  Whatever happened to Congress?
[01:54:29.924 --> 01:54:30.405]  Is he legal?
[01:54:31.025 --> 01:54:35.290]  Exactly, but I'm saying it's gone, it's over.
[01:54:35.290 --> 01:54:38.013]  And that's what our issue is.
[01:54:38.013 --> 01:54:48.363]  The first great war, and what we're telling people to do is to prepare, survive, and prevail.
[01:54:48.363 --> 01:54:51.226]  Because people better grow up here.
[01:54:51.226 --> 01:54:52.308]  The game is over.
[01:54:53.612 --> 01:54:54.953]  Look what they're doing.
[01:54:54.953 --> 01:55:00.735]  Now they're putting the guise of war as humanitarian missions.
[01:55:00.735 --> 01:55:05.036]  You know, at least Bush called it a pre-emptive issue.
[01:55:05.036 --> 01:55:09.518]  Now they're taking us to war under the guise of humanitarian.
[01:55:09.518 --> 01:55:12.979]  And they're using that again as part of the nomenclature.
[01:55:12.979 --> 01:55:15.120]  And it's exactly right.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.781]  The traitors are amongst us.
[01:55:17.962 --> 01:55:21.605]  And the people, again, the people have lost the fight in this country.
[01:55:21.605 --> 01:55:32.857]  I just read an article about in Ohio, for example, there are more kids dying from overdosing on prescription drug painkillers than
[01:55:33.377 --> 01:55:36.359]  Then auto accidents, or drunk driving.
[01:55:36.359 --> 01:55:42.182]  You know, so that the whole morality of the nation is being rotted out.
[01:55:42.182 --> 01:55:45.724]  I was mentioning before the break about what I read today.
[01:55:45.724 --> 01:55:52.668]  Hillary Clinton chastising Gaddafi for using, allegedly using, cluster bombs.
[01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:55.814]  And I said to myself, wow, that's interesting.
[01:55:55.814 --> 01:56:00.256]  How about all that depleted uranium the United States dumped all over Iraq?
[01:56:00.256 --> 01:56:01.856]  Oh, that's OK.
[01:56:01.856 --> 01:56:03.737]  And now Libya.
[01:56:03.737 --> 01:56:04.297]  Oh, yeah.
[01:56:04.297 --> 01:56:09.059]  And how about Israel, you know, bombing Lebanon with cluster bombs?
[01:56:09.059 --> 01:56:10.480]  Oh, not a peep about that.
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:14.443]  Oh, and how about those Predator drones?
[01:56:14.443 --> 01:56:16.705]  Listen, Gaddafi's a rookie.
[01:56:16.705 --> 01:56:19.968]  I mean, he should be picking up America's atrocities.
[01:56:19.968 --> 01:56:25.693]  Could you imagine if they had Abu Ghraib in Libya?
[01:56:25.693 --> 01:56:28.955]  How they would be talking about that?
[01:56:28.955 --> 01:56:30.697]  And the mainstream media, you know what?
[01:56:30.697 --> 01:56:32.639]  I've come up with a name for them.
[01:56:32.639 --> 01:56:34.660]  They're nothing more than prostitutes.
[01:56:35.501 --> 01:56:40.346]  They're whores for the people in power.
[01:56:40.346 --> 01:56:42.688]  It's the revolving door.
[01:56:42.688 --> 01:56:49.135]  You have this guy, Carney, James Carney, the White House spokesperson.
[01:56:49.135 --> 01:56:50.516]  Hey, where did he come from?
[01:56:50.516 --> 01:56:52.498]  It's just Time Magazine.
[01:56:52.498 --> 01:56:55.601]  He couldn't have been a Yalie, could he?
[01:56:55.601 --> 01:56:58.984]  You really mean Harvard, Princeton, Yale, bullets, bombs, and banks?
[01:56:59.798 --> 01:57:04.161]  So the whole thing, Alex, it is a world order.
[01:57:04.161 --> 01:57:14.948]  And all you have to do to see the proof is to see who took most of the money from the Fed discount window.
[01:57:14.948 --> 01:57:16.629]  Foreign banks.
[01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:20.832]  What's Fed money going to bail out foreign banks?
[01:57:20.832 --> 01:57:29.498]  20 trillion dollars worth of back-end deals on the other end going to Bank of Scotland, Japan, to the Deutsche Bank.
[01:57:30.058 --> 01:57:31.018]  On and on.
[01:57:31.018 --> 01:57:35.880]  So anybody that, I, you know, I used to say, ah, this new world order, come on.
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:39.461]  The golden rule, those who have the gold rule.
[01:57:39.461 --> 01:57:50.664]  And the gold is coming out of our pockets, stealing, stolen by the Fed, and spread over to the other world banks that are running the show.
[01:57:51.994 --> 01:57:53.716]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:57:53.716 --> 01:57:59.021]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:57:59.021 --> 01:58:00.563]  Saving means to make money.
[01:58:00.563 --> 01:58:09.351]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:58:10.092 --> 01:58:17.615]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:58:17.615 --> 01:58:25.618]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:58:25.618 --> 01:58:30.840]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:33.001]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:58:50.486 --> 01:58:55.050]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.050 --> 01:58:55.950]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:59.373]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.373 --> 01:59:00.234]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.234 --> 01:59:05.137]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.137 --> 01:59:05.878]  It's true.
[01:59:05.878 --> 01:59:10.742]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.742 --> 01:59:11.582]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.582 --> 01:59:15.165]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.165 --> 01:59:18.868]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.048 --> 01:59:19.848]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.848 --> 01:59:22.609]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:26.290]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.290 --> 01:59:27.090]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.090 --> 01:59:31.231]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.231 --> 01:59:36.293]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.293 --> 01:59:40.454]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
