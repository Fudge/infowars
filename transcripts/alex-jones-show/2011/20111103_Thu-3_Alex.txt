[00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:18.139]  Tyranny is here.
[00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.641]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:30.083]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:00:30.523 --> 00:00:36.805]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:42.747]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:00:43.167 --> 00:00:46.848]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:00:47.328 --> 00:00:51.332]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:57.557]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:00:57.577 --> 00:01:00.560]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:02.542]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:03.623]  It's here.

[00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:31.118]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:37.944]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.851]  All right, welcome folks.
[00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.893]  Hey, welcome back to the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:01:58.933 --> 00:02:04.196]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, now going to be filling in for the next two hours.
[00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:06.378]  And thank you for your patience.
[00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:12.242]  I was scheduled to jump in about a half an hour ago, but of course David Icke called in and it wasn't that a fascinating interview.
[00:02:12.722 --> 00:02:19.187]  You know, I've read all of David Icke's books and I find him just to be a fascinating person, just a tremendous
[00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:29.253]  Researcher and I hope you enjoyed that interview segment some really I mean every time I think I've got things Sort of at least a little bit figured out out there in the industry.
[00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:30.454]  What's going on with GMOs?
[00:02:30.494 --> 00:02:31.835]  What's going on with vaccines?
[00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:47.125]  I just opened up David Icke's book and then whoa, there's a whole nother layer behind that So that was a great interview and thank you for for waiting and thank you for your patience now what we have coming up for you in the next few minutes actually over the next hour or two is
[00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:52.686]  We've got an interview with Pam Larry coming right up in just a couple of minutes.
[00:02:52.947 --> 00:02:58.908]  And she is the woman who began the GMO labeling initiative in California.
[00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.809]  She's the one who started the whole thing.
[00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:03.390]  Really cool.
[00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.910]  What a great idea.
[00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.591]  It's really important because California can set the precedent.
[00:03:08.436 --> 00:03:18.145]  That could then just spread across the country and get GMOs labeled on foods and of course that would very quickly cause people to start avoiding GMOs and that's what we want.
[00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:19.867]  I mean we want choice, right?
[00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:22.669]  We want honesty in the labels so that we can make a choice.
[00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.972]  And avoid GMOs if that's what we wish to do.
[00:03:26.012 --> 00:03:30.496]  And I think most people wish to avoid genetically modified food, so that would be a big deal.
[00:03:30.516 --> 00:03:33.960]  So we're going to have her on in just probably 60 seconds or so.
[00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.425]  We've also got another guest following her, Rachel Pachivas from California.
[00:03:41.226 --> 00:03:49.453]  She's also part of the GMO initiative, but in addition she has some information about the Occupy Oakland situation.
[00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.315]  As you know, there was some violence erupted yesterday that was covered on Drudge Report, in fact.
[00:03:57.076 --> 00:04:01.680]  And after that, we're going to be talking briefly, if we can get him on, Michael Badar, who was there on the scene.
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:10.708]  And then finally, later on, about an hour from now or so, Robert Scott Bell will be joining us to give us an update on the Raw Milk Freedom Riders event.
[00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:20.775]  That just took place a few days ago, a couple of days ago, where a caravan of moms drank raw milk in front of the FDA.
[00:04:20.795 --> 00:04:26.339]  In fact, they dipped the cookies in it, and they had raw milk and cookies in front of the FDA.
[00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:32.563]  And the FDA responded to that with a letter, and we'll be going over the FDA's response and what it means.
[00:04:32.623 --> 00:04:34.925]  It's really quite fascinating, and good job.
[00:04:35.345 --> 00:04:40.489]  Big shout-out to all those wonderful moms who took part in that peaceful protest.
[00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:43.091]  Yeah, they didn't have to fire bullets or anything.
[00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.533]  They just drank raw milk and ate some cookies.
[00:04:46.573 --> 00:04:51.357]  What a wonderful message for peace, but also liberty and courage at the same time.
[00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:54.720]  Now, as I promised, coming up, Pam Larry right here.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.262]  In fact, she should be on the phone joining us to talk about this.
[00:04:57.562 --> 00:05:01.225]  We've got Pam for about 10 to 15 minutes.
[00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:02.686]  Pam, are you on the phone?
[00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:03.127]  Can you hear me?
[00:05:03.832 --> 00:05:05.012]  I am, and I can hear you.
[00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:05.553]  How are you doing?
[00:05:05.673 --> 00:05:06.153]  Okay, great.
[00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:07.113]  I'm doing fantastic.
[00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:10.614]  Thank you for joining us here on the InfoWars Money Bomb Edition.
[00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:14.196]  Give people a little bit of background about this.
[00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:20.238]  Why did you begin the GMO Labeling Initiative drive, the petition drive, in California?
[00:05:21.007 --> 00:05:46.232]  Sure, well I had been studying about genetically engineered foods for about 7-8 years and was getting increasingly depressed about the whole thing and just like looking at the legislative efforts that never went anywhere and you know petition after online petition yada yada and finally I mean I was just getting actually quite depressed about it and I just really kind of had an epiphany one morning lying in bed in San Francisco
[00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:54.815]  Then it was time for the people of California to vote on genetically engineered food so that we'd remember how powerful we are when we take back our food.
[00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:56.835]  So that's how it started.
[00:05:57.155 --> 00:05:59.156]  And that was on January 20th.
[00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.357]  Okay, so January 20th.
[00:06:01.397 --> 00:06:05.998]  But since then, you've had all kinds of support, not just support in the press.
[00:06:06.238 --> 00:06:08.039]  Tell us about that, and the financial support too.
[00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:18.401]  Sure, so I took about six weeks to learn how to do an initiative, got a website up, made a Facebook page, and just kind of started reaching out.
[00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:29.224]  Started down in Southern California because that's where the most population is, went to small meetings, people came on board, said they'd leave their communities, and slowly it just started to snowball.
[00:06:29.964 --> 00:06:37.066]  And then late in June, I got contacted by Dr. Bronner's magical folk, David Bronner,
[00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:41.409]  I can talk about this now because they've wanted to keep a lot of this under wraps for a long time.
[00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:47.192]  And he said that they wanted to get involved and do a feasibility study, so that was done.
[00:06:47.232 --> 00:06:48.173]  A survey was done.
[00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.694]  All sorts of great stuff was done.
[00:06:49.934 --> 00:06:52.376]  And just more and more people.
[00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:53.817]  We've got other organizations.
[00:06:53.877 --> 00:06:57.299]  The Organic Consumers Association has always been supportive.
[00:06:58.004 --> 00:07:14.803]  Jeffery Smith is supportive, um, Center for Food Safety, um, let me see, gosh, there's the Food Democracy Now, we've got different businesses on board now, Nature's Path, Mercola, you guys, all sorts of, it's just amazing what's happening and exploding right now.
[00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:16.104]  It's across the industry.
[00:07:16.164 --> 00:07:19.586]  I mean, the names you just named there, that's across the industry.
[00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:22.548]  It's really a coalition, you might say, of all these groups.
[00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:27.351]  The publishers, the cereal company you mentioned, Nature's Path, the Organic Consumers Association.
[00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:29.192]  And this crosses all political lines.
[00:07:29.272 --> 00:07:32.074]  It's left, right, it's libertarian, it's conservative, it's everything.
[00:07:32.134 --> 00:07:32.714]  It's independent.
[00:07:33.655 --> 00:07:35.516]  But isn't it wonderful that it has come to this?
[00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:37.777]  But you've got all that support.
[00:07:37.857 --> 00:07:39.158]  What about the opposition?
[00:07:39.238 --> 00:07:40.519]  What are you now anticipating?
[00:07:41.109 --> 00:07:43.733]  Well, we're anticipating quite a bit of opposition, actually.
[00:07:43.793 --> 00:07:45.795]  I mean, that's pretty much a no-brainer.
[00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:57.571]  You know, they have started with some blogs already, you know, totally misrepresenting the issues, you know, that we've had this for 2,000 years, blah, blah, blah, you know the whole story.
[00:07:58.472 --> 00:08:03.858]  Um, they've been, you know, pooh-poohing it as we're Luddites, you know, all that kind of stuff.
[00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:06.441]  Or that it's a crazy California thing.
[00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:12.227]  But, you know, and we anticipate that the mudslinging will get, you know, will increase and get worse.
[00:08:12.987 --> 00:08:17.112]  Um, you know, because that's what you do when you're trying to hold on to something that, you know, is a losing proposition.
[00:08:18.473 --> 00:08:24.718]  Well, at least if they're going to have integrity, they should sling genetically modified mud and not just the regular earth mud.
[00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:27.501]  You know, I mean, come on, people.
[00:08:27.901 --> 00:08:33.546]  They're saying we're Luddites because we don't want to have our food engineered by a bunch of evil scientists?
[00:08:33.686 --> 00:08:34.727]  That seems strange.
[00:08:35.187 --> 00:08:38.310]  Yeah, and one of our things is if they're so wonderful, why not label them?
[00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.552]  Because you should be advertising and want them labeled.
[00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:41.813]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:08:41.873 --> 00:08:45.416]  It should say, now featuring extra GMOs, right on the package.
[00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:46.537]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:47.623 --> 00:08:48.343]  Pretty cool, yeah.
[00:08:48.684 --> 00:08:51.025]  But just the ground full of support has been amazing.
[00:08:51.085 --> 00:08:53.866]  I mean, we started with one person on March 10th.
[00:08:54.326 --> 00:09:04.351]  We now, on a grassroots level, have over 100 leaders throughout the state organizing their communities, going to events, showing movies, having tabling, you know, information to give out.
[00:09:04.791 --> 00:09:07.692]  We're gearing up for Signature Gathering, which should start soon.
[00:09:07.712 --> 00:09:09.933]  You know, having trainings about that.
[00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:13.375]  You can visit our website, it's at labeledgmos.org.
[00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:14.655]  Wait a minute, what is the site again?
[00:09:14.696 --> 00:09:15.516]  I didn't get that.
[00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:18.012]  LabelGMOs.org.
[00:09:18.393 --> 00:09:20.333]  Okay, LabelGMOs.org.
[00:09:20.773 --> 00:09:31.695]  Yeah, and we have our different events at the official grassroots campaign site, and we have our events up there, on there, for people throughout the state to join us.
[00:09:32.336 --> 00:09:33.516]  We're inviting everybody.
[00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:38.157]  I mean, this is going to take, as I call it, not just a large village, but a large universe.
[00:09:39.398 --> 00:09:45.202]  To get voted in on groups large and small, individuals, companies, organizations.
[00:09:45.702 --> 00:09:47.684]  We've all got to come together because this is big.
[00:09:48.497 --> 00:09:57.379]  It is big, and we are coming together, and one of the things that's really cool about that is here at InfoWars, Alex Jones has been covering this issue, giving it a lot of coverage.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.960]  He gets it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.501]  He recognizes the threat that this is to our food, to our fertility.
[00:10:03.521 --> 00:10:05.002]  I mean, he was just interviewing David Wolfe.
[00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:06.382]  I'm sorry, David Icke.
[00:10:06.402 --> 00:10:07.022]  Excuse me.
[00:10:07.902 --> 00:10:08.983]  I was talking to David earlier.
[00:10:09.223 --> 00:10:13.744]  He was just interviewing David Icke about genetics and the future of the human race.
[00:10:14.284 --> 00:10:20.430]  And so he's on board with it, InfoWars is on board with it, and now you've got this petition coming in.
[00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.751]  It's really incredible.
[00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:29.798]  Can you talk about the importance of now using this petition to bypass Congress, in a sense?
[00:10:30.178 --> 00:10:31.960]  Or bypassing the politicians with this?
[00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:32.800]  Yes.
[00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:44.150]  So, you know, there are certain things that we have to be really sure that we cover because, you know, labeling food is something that happens all around the country, you know, not just in the state of California.
[00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.292]  So, people often have questions about that.
[00:10:46.332 --> 00:10:47.313]  It's called preemption.
[00:10:48.574 --> 00:10:49.916]  You know, but we've got that covered.
[00:10:49.996 --> 00:10:56.285]  We believe that we have a right in California to have labeling that supersedes any policy.
[00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:59.109]  Not regulation, because labeling is not regulated.
[00:10:59.169 --> 00:10:59.850]  It's a policy.
[00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:03.856]  We feel that we've got really great legal arguments.
[00:11:04.677 --> 00:11:09.945]  To counter any kind of challenge or anything that might come up against it once it's voted in.
[00:11:09.965 --> 00:11:16.054]  We've had an amazing team working on this and it's really pretty monumental.
[00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:19.479]  I mean, this will change the course of food history in this country.
[00:11:20.474 --> 00:11:28.740]  Absolutely, it will change the course of food history and it's going to be really interesting to see what kind of arguments they come out with to fight this.
[00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:45.833]  All kinds of scare campaigns, but really, if people had an accurate assessment of what is safe versus what is scary, you know, what's safe is non-genetically modified food and what is scary is this playing God with the genes and, you know, putting spider genes in plants and putting
[00:11:47.094 --> 00:11:49.796]  Animal genes in plants and pesticide genes in plants.
[00:11:50.357 --> 00:11:52.398]  What could be more frightening than that?
[00:11:52.418 --> 00:11:55.141]  Especially if you understand anything about science, really.
[00:11:55.161 --> 00:12:00.225]  The neat part is that we're really focusing on our right to know.
[00:12:03.648 --> 00:12:09.252]  No matter where you come down, I mean, there are quite a few people who are pro-GMO who are also pro-labeling.
[00:12:09.453 --> 00:12:14.157]  Because, you know, one of our other sayings is, you know, farmers' right to grow, our right to know.
[00:12:14.257 --> 00:12:18.120]  Because that's the way that the law reads right now, is that people can plant this stuff.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.282]  But we're saying, okay, fine.
[00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:22.604]  You know, the law supports you in doing that.
[00:12:22.664 --> 00:12:30.931]  Well, we believe that, you know, informed consumer rights should supersede corporate, you know, non-transparent profit.
[00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:34.555]  You know, their ability to make money by hiding things from us.
[00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:38.577]  Yeah, there's a lot of money that has been made by hiding things from people.
[00:12:39.437 --> 00:12:44.000]  Now, we've got Rachel Pachivas coming on in just a couple of minutes following you here, Pam.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:54.786]  And by the way, I want to say, even before recently, I wasn't aware that you were the person who started this petition, so kudos to you, and I think you deserve tremendous credit.
[00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:56.387]  Well, thank you very much.
[00:12:56.447 --> 00:12:59.688]  You know, but if it just stayed me, it wouldn't be going anywhere.
[00:13:00.229 --> 00:13:04.150]  It's like, you know, I was kind of like the spark and everybody kind of went, yeah, good idea.
[00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.071]  And so everyone's coming on board and it's been really, really great.
[00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:08.831]  Yeah, large and small.
[00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:16.834]  If you think about it, you are a great example of being an effective, what we might call here, an info warrior, because I don't know if you use that metaphor.
[00:13:17.214 --> 00:13:19.915]  Maybe you're an info educator, whatever metaphor you use.
[00:13:20.915 --> 00:13:26.181]  This shows the power of one individual to initiate, to catalyze change that can change the world.
[00:13:26.701 --> 00:13:30.005]  Yeah, and it's just one of the things is that I just keep going.
[00:13:30.545 --> 00:13:34.109]  You just keep going because a lot of times, I mean, I didn't know where this was going to end up.
[00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:40.736]  I had no idea, you know, but you know, once you feel the call, you just got to keep going and that's the advice that I give folks.
[00:13:40.836 --> 00:13:41.337]  If you have
[00:13:41.857 --> 00:13:42.597]  You know, join us.
[00:13:42.837 --> 00:13:47.419]  Get your, you know, invite your community to keep coming, you know, and just keep going.
[00:13:47.479 --> 00:13:48.719]  Maybe you get a few no's.
[00:13:48.779 --> 00:13:55.281]  Maybe everybody says no at the beginning, but you just keep going and pretty soon people start going, yeah, yeah, this sounds like a good idea.
[00:13:55.341 --> 00:13:55.902]  We could do this.
[00:13:56.422 --> 00:14:04.204]  You know, we've got a few people that were, you know, pretty adamantly against this when we started, you know, within the industry because they were afraid and now they're on board.
[00:14:04.224 --> 00:14:06.125]  I mean, it's just been amazing to watch.
[00:14:06.365 --> 00:14:06.625]  Yeah.
[00:14:06.725 --> 00:14:10.588]  So yeah, my main message is to be any kind of a peaceful warrior.
[00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:13.290]  It's just to keep going and to keep listening to your heart.
[00:14:14.091 --> 00:14:14.851]  Absolutely.
[00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:15.712]  Well said, Pam.
[00:14:15.892 --> 00:14:19.415]  I want to thank you for taking a few minutes to join us here on the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:23.478]  And by the way, I'd really love to have you on Natural News as a guest later on.
[00:14:23.538 --> 00:14:26.320]  So let's plan to exchange some texts after this.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:30.563]  I think more people need to hear an extended interview with you, a lot more details.
[00:14:30.723 --> 00:14:31.364]  So thank you, Pam.
[00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:32.184]  Much appreciated.
[00:14:32.224 --> 00:14:33.465]  Can I just, one more thing.
[00:14:33.485 --> 00:14:34.286]  Can I just invite people
[00:14:34.326 --> 00:14:34.586]  Thank you.
[00:14:49.833 --> 00:14:50.774]  Really good point, Pam.
[00:14:50.874 --> 00:14:52.775]  Label GMOs dot org.
[00:14:53.395 --> 00:14:54.396]  And that's plural.
[00:14:54.436 --> 00:14:56.837]  Label GMOs, plural, dot org.
[00:14:56.857 --> 00:14:58.118]  Because we don't want to label just one of them.
[00:14:58.618 --> 00:14:59.859]  Ah, that apple, that's modified.
[00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:01.239]  But the rest, you don't know.
[00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:02.340]  No, we want to label them all.
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.801]  That's what this petition is all about.
[00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:09.084]  All right, now I believe we have on the line joining us is Rachel Pachivis.
[00:15:09.864 --> 00:15:10.605]  Not ready yet.
[00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:11.005]  Okay.
[00:15:11.565 --> 00:15:18.910]  She will be joining us here in a couple of seconds, but along the lines here, by the way, I mentioned the importance of InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:35.581]  Well, of course, this is a fundraising broadcast for InfoWars, which continues to fight the frontline battles right here on many issues, not just GMOs, but also free speech and politics and Federal Reserve and all of these issues that affect you and your children's future.
[00:15:36.121 --> 00:15:39.163]  So, please consider supporting InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:42.264]  I'm here as a volunteer also.
[00:15:42.364 --> 00:15:45.166]  In fact, I was here juicing for the whole crew.
[00:15:45.186 --> 00:15:46.606]  I'll talk about that more later.
[00:15:46.887 --> 00:15:49.968]  Got a big bag of carrots right here under the seat, believe it or not.
[00:15:51.029 --> 00:15:52.249]  Seriously, here we go.
[00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:53.930]  15 pounds of carrots.
[00:15:54.511 --> 00:15:57.912]  This is what we have yet to juice here for the crew.
[00:15:57.932 --> 00:16:04.336]  We're going to try to keep everybody powered up, juiced up with some good, fresh, organic, non-GMO produce.
[00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:06.856]  So, Rachel is on the line.
[00:16:06.897 --> 00:16:08.137]  Rachel, thank you for joining us.
[00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:10.157]  Welcome to the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:16:10.177 --> 00:16:12.078]  Thank you for having me.
[00:16:12.158 --> 00:16:12.778]  Thank you so much.
[00:16:13.118 --> 00:16:14.259]  It's great to have you on.
[00:16:14.299 --> 00:16:17.800]  Sorry about the delay there, Rachel, and I know you only have a few minutes to join us.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:19.580]  That's okay.
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.881]  Let's jump right into it then.
[00:16:21.221 --> 00:16:32.004]  Tell us what has been happening there in Oakland with GMOs, with the GMO petition, but also with some of what you observed over the last couple of days with the Occupy protest.
[00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:35.103]  Yeah, so I went the other night, Tuesday night.
[00:16:35.143 --> 00:16:37.725]  I have some friends who have a traveling tea bus.
[00:16:38.545 --> 00:16:54.217]  And we just pulled up and we started serving tea to everyone and everyone was just really, really open and everyone was really welcoming and it was really nice to see such an eclectic group and there's just people of all different kinds hanging out, sitting in circles, drinking tea together.
[00:16:54.237 --> 00:16:58.701]  So it was really eye-opening to see all of it and envision something so amazing.
[00:16:59.201 --> 00:17:08.304]  So you get a good feeling of community involvement there and a lot of people peacefully working in a common direction?
[00:17:08.364 --> 00:17:10.464]  Is that kind of the takeaway that was your experience?
[00:17:10.484 --> 00:17:11.245]  Oh my goodness!
[00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:12.165]  Yes, it was so amazing.
[00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:18.307]  Like, one of my girlfriends and I were walking through and there's a tent for a library and a media center and a prayer center.
[00:17:18.327 --> 00:17:19.367]  There's a children's tent.
[00:17:19.947 --> 00:17:26.131]  There is meditation and grounding, there is a garden, there is like a kitchen and sanitary and composting and recycling.
[00:17:26.551 --> 00:17:31.174]  And everyone, everyone's thanking everyone all the time and just really appreciating everyone who's there.
[00:17:31.194 --> 00:17:44.643]  And they're just such lovely people and you see stuff on the TV and YouTube and everything and you're not really sure what their goal is and what everything's going on, but when you go there and you talk to people, all they want is equality.
[00:17:44.783 --> 00:17:46.644]  You know, all everyone wants is to be the
[00:17:46.664 --> 00:17:47.765]  It's the same as everyone else.
[00:17:47.785 --> 00:17:48.905]  We just see one with everyone.
[00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:51.947]  And it was really, really nice to be a part of it for a few hours.
[00:17:52.027 --> 00:17:55.950]  Well, um, but there was some violence reported there.
[00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:03.974]  Uh, there, let's see, the report, city officials said that there were protesters hurling rocks, explosives, bottles.
[00:18:04.015 --> 00:18:08.277]  I mean, these are their own words, but that apparently that was a completely different group.
[00:18:08.317 --> 00:18:10.819]  Did you, uh, did you see that group?
[00:18:11.239 --> 00:18:12.660]  Did you have any knowledge of that group?
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.182]  You know, what I experienced was nothing like that.
[00:18:15.282 --> 00:18:25.412]  And I spoke with a few people who were brutalized by the police and they were saying how they feel the police is hiring people to come in and start arguments and start mayhem and chaos going on in the camp.
[00:18:26.072 --> 00:18:33.980]  And what I experienced was just everyone, everyone is helping everyone and there's a few people on the outskirts who kind of just hang out and they're not really a part of it.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.702]  But those people kind of, they go away because they feel that that's not what is going on there.
[00:18:38.762 --> 00:18:45.546]  And the people that are there for the right reasons are all working together and they're working at, you know, it's 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock at night.
[00:18:45.966 --> 00:18:52.250]  They were nailing in garden beds and creating bins and organizing for compost and creating an altar.
[00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:58.213]  That's the general reason I went there was because I wanted to have some GMO info on one of the altars there.
[00:18:58.933 --> 00:19:01.555]  One of our volunteers mentioned to me that they're creating an altar in
[00:19:03.544 --> 00:19:06.546]  Well, I'm curious, I mean, an altar, what kind of altar?
[00:19:07.327 --> 00:19:08.908]  What symbols were being used there?
[00:19:08.968 --> 00:19:22.298]  What was it being, what was the... You know, there were peace signs, there were flowers, there was the American flag, there were people holding hands, there was just people loving people, pretty much is what I can say.
[00:19:22.338 --> 00:19:25.841]  Just all these different movements had little flowers at the altar.
[00:19:25.861 --> 00:19:33.387]  Just every one of small, small quantities was recognized at this altar that usually isn't recognized.
[00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:35.012]  Wow, very interesting.
[00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:39.695]  What about, you said you were aware of some people being brutalized by police.
[00:19:39.735 --> 00:19:42.838]  Was that something you saw yourself, or was that something you heard?
[00:19:42.858 --> 00:19:44.739]  No, he was telling me something I heard.
[00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:46.380]  He was sitting in the T-Bus with us.
[00:19:46.941 --> 00:19:57.689]  At one point in the night, we were sitting in the T-Bus, all kind of telling stories, and he was talking about how he was taken and handcuffed and thrown into the back of a car, and it was completely black and pitch black and dark.
[00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.752]  And he was scared, and he had no idea why he was being arrested.
[00:20:02.953 --> 00:20:10.576]  I didn't really get into the full conversation with him because I was serving tea, but it sounded awful, it sounded ridiculous, but that's actually going on.
[00:20:11.016 --> 00:20:13.116]  And you wonder, why is this happening?
[00:20:13.297 --> 00:20:14.757]  Why does this need to happen?
[00:20:14.997 --> 00:20:26.321]  Do you believe, as a person who has been there on the scene, on the front lines, talking with the people, you've been part of these groups, the drinking of tea, the holding hands, these kinds of things.
[00:20:26.801 --> 00:20:35.670]  Do you think that the acts of violence that were going on, or the police brutality, are these things that are being injected into the group from outside forces?
[00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:37.592]  Is this something that's being engineered?
[00:20:37.612 --> 00:20:39.614]  Do you have any sense of... Definitely.
[00:20:39.694 --> 00:20:41.456]  They are not violent people.
[00:20:41.476 --> 00:20:44.399]  I did not get any... or else I wouldn't have been there.
[00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:45.760]  I don't like to be in violent places.
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.362]  I don't like to be around people like that.
[00:20:47.802 --> 00:20:48.142]  We're good to go.
[00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.011]  Hey, what can I help you with, you know?
[00:21:20.208 --> 00:21:20.909]  I heard about that.
[00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.030]  I was not there.
[00:21:23.471 --> 00:21:26.534]  I heard that doors were smashed in, but I was not there.
[00:21:26.574 --> 00:21:27.655]  I don't know what happened.
[00:21:29.357 --> 00:21:31.158]  To me, that's a sign that this doesn't make sense.
[00:21:31.439 --> 00:21:38.165]  The group that you're talking about, the peace altar people, they would never smash down the doors of a Whole Foods, it seems.
[00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:41.468]  What kind of a group would attack the Whole Foods front doors?
[00:21:43.951 --> 00:21:52.842]  Yeah, I don't know if there's different groups going on here or if there's something may have happened where they did something to them and they're just retaliating.
[00:21:53.223 --> 00:22:01.473]  You know, I'm not really sure, but definitely the people I saw were just inspiring and they're all prepping for their march on the following day on Wednesday the 2nd.
[00:22:02.372 --> 00:22:09.896]  Alright, so Rachel, one of the things that you were doing there was helping to spread the word about GMOs, and were you getting signatures for the GMO labeling initiative?
[00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:10.356]  I was not.
[00:22:10.597 --> 00:22:10.977]  I was not.
[00:22:11.017 --> 00:22:12.778]  We're not yet in the signature gathering process.
[00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:13.138]  Oh, okay.
[00:22:13.158 --> 00:22:14.679]  We're still waiting until the end of December.
[00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:23.444]  So right now we're just, I mean, we're recruiting pledges and volunteers, but I just wanted to get an idea of what everyone was doing.
[00:22:24.204 --> 00:22:33.250]  The key message that we're trying to get across here with Label GMOs is that we support Occupy Oakland and we support all of the Occupies and we're all in this together.
[00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:40.715]  We want truth as Label GMOs because we deserve the right to know as human beings and we want justice and we want equality.
[00:22:42.943 --> 00:22:49.725]  Well, I mean, gosh, you can only be on I Know for another few minutes, but some of those are tricky terms.
[00:22:49.765 --> 00:22:57.088]  I mean, obviously we want justice, but when you start saying we want equality, I think it sort of depends on your interpretation of that.
[00:22:57.368 --> 00:22:59.989]  Like, we don't want to force everybody to be the same.
[00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:01.989]  We want to respect individuality, right?
[00:23:02.249 --> 00:23:06.291]  But we want to give everybody an equal opportunity to express who they are.
[00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:07.331]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:23:08.106 --> 00:23:19.973]  Absolutely, and we, with equality I mean that, uh, I hope I don't get in trouble here, that politicians, they, we want the same as, like we all deserve the same.
[00:23:20.374 --> 00:23:20.794]  You know what I mean?
[00:23:20.814 --> 00:23:21.855]  We're all people.
[00:23:21.935 --> 00:23:36.744]  We're all people on this earth together and, um, one of the things that I was also hearing about was how the Mayor of Oakland went out and she wanted to speak and some of the key people in the Occupy camp, they're like, you know, she can speak but she's gonna wait in line like everybody else.
[00:23:37.384 --> 00:23:37.965]  Well, the same.
[00:23:37.985 --> 00:23:41.968]  And police can come here and hang out and participate, but they're not going to wear their uniform.
[00:23:41.988 --> 00:23:45.752]  They're not going to inflict this fear, you know?
[00:23:45.832 --> 00:23:48.434]  And everyone's the same, and you have to treat it like that.
[00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:51.037]  And that's what I think of when I think of equality.
[00:23:51.994 --> 00:23:53.895]  Yeah, some really good points.
[00:23:53.955 --> 00:24:01.640]  And a lot of this, of course, up for discussion and being discussed on a national scale with all of these Occupy protests.
[00:24:03.382 --> 00:24:06.804]  I'm really glad that a lot of these issues are coming to the forefront and being talked about.
[00:24:07.264 --> 00:24:12.147]  And because, really, if you look at the GMO issue, Rachel, the GMO issue is about transparency.
[00:24:12.167 --> 00:24:14.209]  It's really about corporate transparency, right?
[00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:15.870]  Let's know what's in our food.
[00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.892]  What if we had corporate transparency with the Federal Reserve, too?
[00:24:19.372 --> 00:24:21.894]  Let's know what's in our money, so to speak.
[00:24:22.074 --> 00:24:24.075]  Absolutely, yeah.
[00:24:24.155 --> 00:24:28.077]  Do you find a lot of resonance with that kind of issue with the people that you've been hanging out with too?
[00:24:28.337 --> 00:24:29.257]  Do they talk about the Fed?
[00:24:30.618 --> 00:24:39.222]  I haven't heard much about it, but I'm sure that it's in the back of their minds and they think about it and I think it kind of correlates with everything that's going on.
[00:24:39.322 --> 00:24:43.304]  All of the occupies, you know, all over the country and that's kind of where it all stems from.
[00:24:43.344 --> 00:24:49.967]  It stems from corporate power and it's just not okay and people are finally standing up to it and finally doing something about it.
[00:24:50.489 --> 00:24:51.349]  Yeah, isn't that fascinating?
[00:24:51.369 --> 00:24:55.790]  The corporate power has infiltrated every little corner of society.
[00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.031]  It's infiltrated politics.
[00:24:57.071 --> 00:24:58.691]  It's infiltrated food and farming.
[00:24:59.071 --> 00:25:00.392]  It's infiltrated medicine.
[00:25:00.412 --> 00:25:02.112]  It has infiltrated war.
[00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:02.972]  I mean, war?
[00:25:03.052 --> 00:25:10.734]  What is war but really an excuse to funnel more money to more corporations that are building more bombs and making more bullets and then causing more war?
[00:25:10.754 --> 00:25:12.115]  Absolutely.
[00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:13.315]  It's insane.
[00:25:14.147 --> 00:25:31.540]  It's ridiculous, it's awful, it's so sad and it's like you want to sit here and you want to be happy that you're living in this great country and it's amazing but there's all this craziness going on and you wonder why is this happening and why don't people do something and Occupy, Occupy Everything, they're all starting to do something.
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.682]  Some people, you know, I have conversations with
[00:25:34.042 --> 00:25:37.343]  Co-workers and people that I see on the streets and they're like, you know, they don't really want anything.
[00:25:37.383 --> 00:25:38.424]  What are they working for?
[00:25:38.464 --> 00:25:39.264]  What is their goal?
[00:25:39.544 --> 00:25:41.045]  And I actually had that view in the beginning.
[00:25:41.085 --> 00:25:42.306]  I was like, well, what are they doing?
[00:25:42.846 --> 00:25:58.553]  But you think about it and it takes a while for a group of people with so much motivation and so much hype to actually find a common goal and like to think about everyone having one little goal and how they all kind of have this correlation with each other.
[00:25:58.573 --> 00:25:59.873]  That's the goal.
[00:25:59.993 --> 00:26:01.794]  You know that there's all these different requests.
[00:26:02.898 --> 00:26:09.480]  Yeah, well, I gotta admit, too, some of the actions are a little... I'm not sure where they're going with it.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.240]  For example, blocking the port.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:20.162]  I mean, I understand blocking the port may be a statement against some corporations, but, you know, import and export is crucial to national trade.
[00:26:21.522 --> 00:26:24.863]  Ultimately, I would hope these people don't want to block the port forever.
[00:26:24.903 --> 00:26:26.344]  It's sort of just a symbolic thing.
[00:26:26.724 --> 00:26:27.664]  Why would they block a port?
[00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.090]  I think so.
[00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.892]  I think it's just a temporary thing.
[00:26:30.952 --> 00:26:37.117]  I think they say they need to see that it's people who are creating this impossible.
[00:26:37.277 --> 00:26:38.298]  You know what I mean?
[00:26:38.338 --> 00:26:40.619]  So if you don't have your people with you, you don't have it.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:46.184]  And corporations start to have to realize that because we are the power.
[00:26:47.025 --> 00:26:50.206]  Well, you know folks, the easiest way to block the port is just buy American.
[00:26:50.226 --> 00:26:52.447]  Absolutely.
[00:26:52.507 --> 00:26:53.268]  Buy local.
[00:26:53.308 --> 00:26:54.528]  Buy local organic.
[00:26:54.708 --> 00:26:54.929]  Right.
[00:26:54.969 --> 00:26:55.529]  Buy local.
[00:26:55.589 --> 00:26:57.210]  Buy your food from your local farmers.
[00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.311]  You don't need to get your food imported on a ship from China.
[00:27:00.591 --> 00:27:04.733]  Now, I see you've only got a couple of minutes left, Rachel.
[00:27:06.014 --> 00:27:11.156]  What other thoughts you think are important from what you observed there on the scenes in Oakland yesterday and the day before?
[00:27:12.062 --> 00:27:19.247]  You know, um, I would say, like, I actually want to go down there one day on my day off and just contribute a few hours and help out.
[00:27:19.307 --> 00:27:20.809]  Just be a part of the community.
[00:27:20.829 --> 00:27:21.909]  Because it's not scary.
[00:27:21.929 --> 00:27:24.471]  And, like, I talked to my dad and he was like, oh, you know, it's kind of scary.
[00:27:24.491 --> 00:27:24.972]  Be careful.
[00:27:25.032 --> 00:27:25.612]  It's dangerous.
[00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:26.713]  And I went down there.
[00:27:26.733 --> 00:27:27.534]  It wasn't dangerous.
[00:27:27.754 --> 00:27:28.094]  It was so
[00:27:28.234 --> 00:27:28.754]  It was so peaceful.
[00:27:28.774 --> 00:27:29.475]  It was so calm.
[00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:32.316]  It was people working together and it felt so good.
[00:27:32.376 --> 00:27:34.037]  It felt like that's what life should be about.
[00:27:34.057 --> 00:27:38.340]  As long as the police aren't there hurting people, then it won't be dangerous.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.641]  But, you know, if someone wants to go down there, you don't have to sleep there.
[00:27:41.661 --> 00:27:43.282]  You don't have to camp out and get a tent.
[00:27:43.342 --> 00:27:47.305]  Just go down there and help out and contribute and see what you can do.
[00:27:47.325 --> 00:27:50.867]  Just for a few hours, you know, whatever you can do will help them.
[00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:55.832]  It'll be real interesting to see where this goes, Rachel.
[00:27:56.092 --> 00:27:59.894]  Do you have a blog or anything like that where people can follow your perspective on this?
[00:28:00.714 --> 00:28:01.114]  I don't.
[00:28:01.134 --> 00:28:02.355]  I'm actually working on one.
[00:28:02.395 --> 00:28:06.477]  I never thought to do one, but someone mentioned it to me last week, so I'm working on one now.
[00:28:06.577 --> 00:28:13.379]  I do have an email if people want to email me and contact me either about this or about the label... Okay, yeah, go ahead with that.
[00:28:13.519 --> 00:28:14.100]  What's the email?
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:18.902]  It's berkeley.labelgmo at gmail.com
[00:28:19.927 --> 00:28:27.975]  I'm also on Facebook, so you can search my name or you can search the Label GMO's Berkeley campaign.
[00:28:35.273 --> 00:28:40.496]  Okay, so you can search Rachel Pachivas at Facebook to get your Facebook page.
[00:28:40.976 --> 00:28:42.357]  Well, thank you, Rachel.
[00:28:42.517 --> 00:28:43.838]  Really appreciate you joining us here.
[00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:47.300]  Thank you for your time and for what you're doing out there, for your observations.
[00:28:47.901 --> 00:28:50.062]  And thanks for spending a few minutes with us.
[00:28:50.082 --> 00:28:52.163]  Sorry it was such a late joining.
[00:28:52.183 --> 00:28:52.784]  Oh, thank you so much.
[00:28:53.004 --> 00:28:54.385]  It was such a pleasure to actually be on here.
[00:28:54.405 --> 00:28:54.945]  It's great.
[00:28:55.384 --> 00:28:55.624]  Great.
[00:28:55.744 --> 00:28:56.204]  Well, thank you.
[00:28:56.465 --> 00:28:56.785]  Take care.
[00:28:57.465 --> 00:28:57.845]  So there you go.
[00:28:57.905 --> 00:29:00.987]  Rachel Pachivas here on the InfoWars Money Bomb Edition.
[00:29:01.747 --> 00:29:19.857]  And once again, if you want to help support InfoWars and its ongoing mission for free speech, real journalism, real investigations being brought to you every day and even every evening on the InfoWars Nightly News, then please consider going to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and consider making a
[00:29:20.157 --> 00:29:20.417]  I don't
[00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:38.931]  We've got a four-minute segment coming up here.
[00:29:39.011 --> 00:29:41.993]  We've got Crazy Like Alex Jones.
[00:29:42.093 --> 00:29:44.194]  A bit of a funny video coming up here.
[00:29:44.214 --> 00:29:45.734]  We're going to start that in just a few seconds.
[00:29:45.774 --> 00:29:46.515]  It's a music video.
[00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:48.256]  Crazy Like Alex Jones.
[00:29:48.296 --> 00:29:49.596]  I can't wait to see that one myself.
[00:29:49.636 --> 00:29:50.597]  That should be quite interesting.
[00:29:51.137 --> 00:29:58.361]  And also for those of you who are going to tune into the InfoWars Nightly News at the top of the hour, this broadcast preempts that news show.
[00:29:58.681 --> 00:29:59.561]  So thank you for joining us.
[00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:01.282]  Watch this video right now.
[00:30:01.322 --> 00:30:05.044]  We'll be right back in a few minutes with more here on InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:30:06.969 --> 00:30:10.591]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:10.991 --> 00:30:13.993]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:14.233 --> 00:30:18.995]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:19.015 --> 00:30:25.279]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:27.660]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:28.480]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:28.921]  Bernanke?
[00:30:29.001 --> 00:30:29.662]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:29.682 --> 00:30:30.943]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:30.963 --> 00:30:33.206]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:47.102 --> 00:30:48.944]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:30:49.225 --> 00:30:54.011]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:54.371 --> 00:31:03.502]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:08.723 --> 00:31:09.923]  We even sell guns.
[00:31:10.043 --> 00:31:14.024]  We even, we, well... Oh, God, another rabble slave with a weapon!
[00:31:14.104 --> 00:31:15.225]  Disarming him!
[00:31:15.505 --> 00:31:16.465]  Get the guards!
[00:31:16.565 --> 00:31:18.406]  Disarm him immediately!
[00:31:18.466 --> 00:31:19.846]  Where's one of the slaves?
[00:31:19.906 --> 00:31:20.846]  Have a weapon!
[00:31:20.946 --> 00:31:21.326]  Crazy!
[00:31:21.466 --> 00:31:28.168]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[00:31:28.408 --> 00:31:34.130]  And yet have an incumption without resumption to know what's going on.
[00:31:36.092 --> 00:31:41.340]  Then I can throw bananas at the global clowns and hear aristocratic moans.
[00:31:42.202 --> 00:31:45.888]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[00:31:47.742 --> 00:32:13.184]  I went looking one day on the internet just to see what I could find When I heard this talk show maniac just proudly speak in his mind It was really wild but the more I heard it made a whole lot of sense to me I want to thank you Alex for opening my eyes and helping the blind to see I want to be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones
[00:32:15.163 --> 00:32:20.005]  You can have an abduction without a preception to know what's going on.
[00:32:21.745 --> 00:32:26.267]  Then I can roll bananas at the global clowns and hear aristocratic moans.
[00:32:27.828 --> 00:32:31.529]  I want to be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones.
[00:32:56.838 --> 00:33:16.627]  All the talking heads on the TV screen with an arrogance of this generation Talking about what's been going on around the world and here in the nation They all seem to turn like a pack of wolves when Alex goes on the air It's live in the facts, they launch their attacks and I just don't like it
[00:33:17.127 --> 00:33:45.035]  I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones And yet have an adoption without a presumption that no one's a-goin' on Then I patrol bananas at the Global Clowns and hear aristocratic moans I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones Yeah, I wanna be crazy, crazy like Alex Jones
[00:33:50.837 --> 00:33:52.338]  I'm your Christian leader!
[00:33:52.658 --> 00:33:54.619]  Never mind skull and bones!
[00:33:55.059 --> 00:33:56.800]  Never mind bohemian growth!
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.481]  Never mind my actual policies!
[00:33:59.961 --> 00:34:04.584]  Just buy my rhetoric, buy my lies, because you're my slaves!
[00:34:05.064 --> 00:34:09.866]  We're going to put in a Democrat leader who works for the exact same people, and you're going to love it when they do it!
[00:34:10.106 --> 00:34:15.349]  All you Democrats that hate the Patriot Act, and all you Democrats that hate the police state, you're certainly going to love it!
[00:34:16.749 --> 00:34:17.469]  This is our land.
[00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:18.690]  These are our people.
[00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:20.031]  The workers.
[00:34:20.051 --> 00:34:20.431]  The strivers.
[00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:21.032]  The builders.
[00:34:26.855 --> 00:34:28.617]  These are our people.
[00:34:29.057 --> 00:34:31.659]  Who are they?
[00:34:48.132 --> 00:34:50.254]  They are the dark armies.
[00:34:50.934 --> 00:34:55.458]  The dark murdering armies whose only honor is atrocity.
[00:34:55.478 --> 00:34:57.519]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:34:57.559 --> 00:35:03.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:21.503 --> 00:35:32.338]  And we are back on the InfoWars Money Bomb Edition 24-hour or more broadcast taking place here at the InfoWars studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:35:32.418 --> 00:35:34.601]  I'm filming in for the next hour or so.
[00:35:36.203 --> 00:35:36.923]  Maybe an hour and a half.
[00:35:37.664 --> 00:35:45.508]  I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger, the editor of Natural News, a frequent contributor to InfoWars.com website, and an occasional fill-in host here.
[00:35:46.108 --> 00:35:51.011]  So, very happy to be part of this organization today, just volunteering some time.
[00:35:51.051 --> 00:35:58.174]  In fact, I want to give you a little bit of a behind-the-scenes observation of what's going on here, because it's really fascinating.
[00:35:58.215 --> 00:35:58.515]  This is a
[00:35:59.295 --> 00:36:00.436]  This is a fantastic crew.
[00:36:00.876 --> 00:36:04.299]  Oh, and by the way, what a funny video there of Alex.
[00:36:04.939 --> 00:36:09.663]  I hadn't seen some of that footage, and if you're seeing that for the first time, you might think, wow, that looks pretty wild.
[00:36:10.743 --> 00:36:12.725]  Well, it is called Crazy Like Alex Jones.
[00:36:12.785 --> 00:36:19.170]  It's sort of a fun look at the highlights of some of the craziest, most hilarious stuff that he's done over the years.
[00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.113]  But behind the scenes, Alex Jones is a very authentic, very genuine person.
[00:36:24.973 --> 00:36:28.775]  In fact, he's actually very humble behind the scenes.
[00:36:28.815 --> 00:36:34.439]  He was over here apologizing to me for the delay in having me on because David Icke called in.
[00:36:34.459 --> 00:36:36.280]  I said, you know, Alex, don't worry about it.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.460]  This is a dynamic thing.
[00:36:38.301 --> 00:36:39.061]  Things are flowing.
[00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:40.562]  Things are shifting here all the time.
[00:36:40.582 --> 00:36:42.904]  That's live broadcast.
[00:36:42.924 --> 00:36:44.885]  That's live radio, live internet.
[00:36:45.385 --> 00:36:46.826]  That's what happens, so don't worry about it.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.541]  I brought in, on another topic, I brought in some juicing equipment today.
[00:36:53.561 --> 00:36:56.062]  I already showed you the big bag of carrots over here.
[00:36:56.082 --> 00:36:58.163]  15 pounds of carrots.
[00:36:58.223 --> 00:36:59.043]  Okay, one more shot.
[00:36:59.743 --> 00:37:01.264]  This is still going to be juiced tonight.
[00:37:01.284 --> 00:37:05.805]  We also brought in a bunch of organic apples, organic celery, and parsley.
[00:37:05.985 --> 00:37:11.307]  And we've been working the juicing machine over there to get everybody some juice.
[00:37:11.327 --> 00:37:11.887]  Yeah, there we go.
[00:37:11.907 --> 00:37:12.987]  Nice, nice big shot of it.
[00:37:13.027 --> 00:37:15.188]  This is InfoWars power right here.
[00:37:15.808 --> 00:37:17.129]  Because the reason I did this...
[00:37:18.329 --> 00:37:18.850]  I don't know.
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:39.863]  Everybody here behind the scenes is really interested in health and nutrition.
[00:37:39.903 --> 00:37:42.585]  It's one of the fascinating things about Infowars.
[00:37:42.845 --> 00:37:49.751]  For example, every time that I come here, people walk up to me here, staff members, and they ask me questions about health.
[00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:54.174]  In fact, one of the guys here today was just asking me, what do you think about the Paleolithic diet?
[00:37:55.075 --> 00:37:59.497]  And I said, yeah, that's really good because it's all about no processed food.
[00:38:00.118 --> 00:38:03.539]  It's all about getting back to the basics of where we came from as human beings.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:08.362]  If we could rewind our food a couple hundred years, we would be a lot healthier.
[00:38:08.882 --> 00:38:14.245]  Other people ask me about sometimes food allergies or recipes for different kinds of things.
[00:38:14.285 --> 00:38:16.166]  So I'm always chatting with the crew here.
[00:38:16.466 --> 00:38:19.107]  They're really open to being super healthy and improving their health.
[00:38:19.647 --> 00:38:24.030]  And then sometimes I come in and Jaren's got like two dozen donuts just sitting there.
[00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:30.294]  On his desk, with the orange sparkles, the sprinkles on him.
[00:38:30.854 --> 00:38:35.178]  And I just look at him, I say, Jaren, man, look at that, two dozen donuts.
[00:38:35.998 --> 00:38:41.142]  He says, no, Mike, no, the orange sprinkles, that's vitamin C, right there, right there for you, see?
[00:38:41.862 --> 00:38:44.364]  Clever, clever nutritional knowledge.
[00:38:44.764 --> 00:38:53.130]  No, these guys, Jaren and the rest of the crew, they have their own little scene going on back here behind the glass, behind the camera, behind what you're seeing.
[00:38:54.111 --> 00:39:05.757]  And it is so hilarious to stand there and watch what they do, watch these guys because they're super sharp, they have a great sense of humor, and they joke about all kinds of things.
[00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:12.400]  I said, you know, you should put a camera in that room and simul-broadcast that as a whole separate show.
[00:39:13.161 --> 00:39:14.161]  That would be a big hit.
[00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:17.443]  But then, of course, they probably wouldn't be as funny because some of it's not
[00:39:18.743 --> 00:39:20.183]  Maybe you wouldn't want to air some of that.
[00:39:20.663 --> 00:39:22.804]  But it is very entertaining.
[00:39:23.004 --> 00:39:24.804]  And the guys really, really know what they're doing here.
[00:39:24.844 --> 00:39:25.804]  So, it's a great crew.
[00:39:25.824 --> 00:39:39.767]  One of the other behind-the-scenes things that's going on here is if you walk around the InfoWars studios right now, you start noticing that people are rolling out camping gear, like sleeping bags, things like that, hammocks.
[00:39:40.967 --> 00:39:46.188]  I have a feeling that in another, what, six or eight hours, maybe ten hours, this is going to be
[00:39:47.448 --> 00:39:48.149]  A sleep-in.
[00:39:48.549 --> 00:39:50.370]  It's going to be by InfoWars around here.
[00:39:50.851 --> 00:39:55.014]  We're going to probably turn a corner and there's going to be some homeless guy sleeping there for all we know.
[00:39:55.034 --> 00:39:56.715]  No, I kid.
[00:39:57.095 --> 00:40:00.858]  But the people are really in here, they're really committed for the long haul.
[00:40:01.438 --> 00:40:05.481]  And you can help support them by going to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[00:40:06.162 --> 00:40:12.066]  And if you can help contribute to this organization that's doing such great work, it will be greatly, greatly appreciated.
[00:40:12.867 --> 00:40:20.064]  That's that's that's why I'm here just to just to fill in and help support the work that they're doing for free speech Now joining us in this next segment.
[00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:21.868]  We have another guest coming right up
[00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:38.415]  Michael Badar is on the phone with us, and Michael Badar is... He's... He worked with Dr. Gabriel Cousins at the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center, and he's into all kinds of interesting things, including healthy living, raw foods, things like that.
[00:40:38.515 --> 00:40:46.918]  But the reason he's joining us today is to talk about the Occupy Oakland situation from a slightly different perspective as what you just heard in the previous segment.
[00:40:47.758 --> 00:40:49.799]  So, Michael Badar, are you with us?
[00:40:52.413 --> 00:40:53.333]  I'm doing great, Michael.
[00:40:53.373 --> 00:40:55.135]  Thanks for joining us on the phone.
[00:40:55.155 --> 00:40:56.917]  Good to be here.
[00:40:56.937 --> 00:40:59.319]  Yeah, thanks.
[00:40:59.399 --> 00:41:04.043]  You're now an info warrior here on InfoWarsMoneyBomb.
[00:41:04.443 --> 00:41:06.585]  So what did you see yesterday going on?
[00:41:06.906 --> 00:41:09.328]  Weren't you there at the Whole Foods when some of that scene was happening?
[00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:11.249]  Well, I was.
[00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:16.995]  First, I was just there shopping, and I actually prefer to shop at the local farmer's market
[00:41:19.773 --> 00:41:23.738]  Saturdays and the Oakland DMV Farmer's Market on Sundays.
[00:41:23.758 --> 00:41:24.800]  Everyone should know about that.
[00:41:26.061 --> 00:41:27.503]  The Fat Beats Farmer's Market.
[00:41:27.523 --> 00:41:32.089]  The P-H-A-T-E-E-T-S Farmer's Market.
[00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:33.732]  I was shopping at Whole Foods.
[00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:44.420]  Sometimes I shop there and I was getting some organic oranges and I just walked out into the front of the store after I passed the cashier.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:51.426]  And I had thought maybe I'd walk just to see what was happening at Occupy Oakland while that energy is happening here.
[00:41:51.446 --> 00:41:53.987]  Kind of the quickening that David Icke and Alex were talking about.
[00:41:54.007 --> 00:41:56.249]  Kind of a lot happening at the same time.
[00:41:56.970 --> 00:42:01.973]  But before I could even start walking down towards where I thought the main protests were,
[00:42:02.894 --> 00:42:13.561]  Um, I heard some loud sounds, and I turned, and then there was, um, a relatively small but, you know, significant crowd of people, um, coming over.
[00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:21.907]  Um, and mostly dressed in black and some masks and hiding their identity, and... Wait, wait, wait a minute.
[00:42:22.207 --> 00:42:23.308]  Uh, describe more.
[00:42:23.328 --> 00:42:27.291]  I'm sorry, Michael, didn't mean to interrupt, but you said they were dressed in black and wearing masks?
[00:42:29.045 --> 00:42:30.386]  Well, uh, it's I guess...
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.201]  I mean, their actions said a lot more than their clothing.
[00:42:49.662 --> 00:42:56.565]  I mean, I guess it's the style of the people that kind of unite to do these kinds of actions.
[00:42:57.365 --> 00:43:03.667]  I'm sure they're a small number because they were far fewer than the thousands that were rallying in the peaceful way that Rachel was talking about.
[00:43:03.887 --> 00:43:04.428]  But it's odd.
[00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:09.470]  I mean, a group of people dressed in black wearing masks just assaulting Whole Foods.
[00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:17.012]  There were maps kind of like covered up their nose and down kind of like they wrapped a black kind of sweater around their face.
[00:43:17.533 --> 00:43:17.993]  Okay.
[00:43:18.013 --> 00:43:20.534]  It was so, I'm not sure what the goal is.
[00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:23.055]  I mean they were so immature to not be seen.
[00:43:23.275 --> 00:43:30.657]  I think maturity is like having mutuality and respect and constructive relationships with one another.
[00:43:30.677 --> 00:43:34.859]  I feel like these people, I didn't sense any maturity from them.
[00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:35.819]  What did they do?
[00:43:35.919 --> 00:43:37.180]  What were their actions, Michael?
[00:43:38.609 --> 00:43:42.051]  Well, um, baby, here's what I saw.
[00:43:42.691 --> 00:43:59.281]  Kicking in the little fence that had separated the sort of outdoor eating cafe at the Whole Foods from the sidewalk, kicked in that fence, then started kind of tossing buckets of paint at the windows and walls of the outside of the Whole Foods.
[00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:09.691]  And then hitting the windows and throwing the tables and chairs from that little outdoor cafe past the Whole Foods glass front and shattered one of them.
[00:44:10.632 --> 00:44:22.505]  This left the security of Whole Foods inside, closing the door, shutting it down, and keeping customers inside who were there for about 20 minutes inside and couldn't leave the Whole Foods.
[00:44:24.254 --> 00:44:25.375]  Trapped in Whole Foods.
[00:44:26.575 --> 00:44:28.376]  It's like a cheap horror film.
[00:44:28.396 --> 00:44:32.717]  Alright, so they were smashing in the windows.
[00:44:32.737 --> 00:44:34.177]  I mean, it's not, I don't know why I'm laughing.
[00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:37.138]  I mean, it's a little, it's very strange that this was going on.
[00:44:37.359 --> 00:44:38.879]  Number one, why would they target Whole Foods?
[00:44:39.219 --> 00:44:41.180]  Why would they wear masks?
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:46.402]  I mean, Whole Foods seems like it's the place where a lot of the people who are protesting would be customers.
[00:44:46.502 --> 00:44:47.682]  Why would they target Whole Foods?
[00:44:47.702 --> 00:44:50.143]  Why wouldn't they go attack a bank or something?
[00:44:52.219 --> 00:44:57.664]  I don't think we can connect the people that were mainly marching and rallying and participating with these individuals.
[00:44:57.764 --> 00:44:59.266]  I don't think they have the same philosophy.
[00:44:59.286 --> 00:45:01.988]  I don't think they have... I think this is very opportunistic.
[00:45:02.008 --> 00:45:06.993]  It's just not what I've seen on TV at any other city's Occupy protests.
[00:45:08.014 --> 00:45:18.043]  And I don't believe they share the respect for life and it's respect for one another that the whole Occupy protest
[00:45:19.158 --> 00:45:22.860]  Did you get any sense of how old the members of this group were?
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.682]  Did they look like teenagers in the way they moved and the way they walked?
[00:45:26.722 --> 00:45:28.603]  Or did they look older?
[00:45:28.623 --> 00:45:32.385]  I'd say teenagers, maybe early 20s at the most.
[00:45:32.465 --> 00:45:33.926]  That's what I sense.
[00:45:33.966 --> 00:45:37.988]  Like rebellious college students or high school dropouts.
[00:45:38.484 --> 00:45:49.778]  Okay, so maybe some of what we saw in London a few months ago with the UK riots and the burning of their own city, is that, did it seem like it was just an expression of destructive outrage?
[00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:52.041]  Yeah, that's a far better comparison.
[00:45:53.314 --> 00:45:54.895]  Wow, well that's really weird.
[00:45:55.395 --> 00:46:08.603]  I mean, so you got this one group that's setting up an altar and drinking tea and they've got peace signs and all this, and then you have this other group of kids wearing black and black masks that are bashing in windows at Whole Foods.
[00:46:09.804 --> 00:46:11.105]  Were there any police there?
[00:46:11.125 --> 00:46:11.825]  What happened next?
[00:46:13.526 --> 00:46:15.667]  Well, there weren't police until way later.
[00:46:16.047 --> 00:46:17.108]  I actually stayed around.
[00:46:17.308 --> 00:46:18.749]  Actually, I did some other news interviews.
[00:46:21.229 --> 00:46:32.215]  I did these news interviews and the police eventually came to investigate and get evidence to see what they could get.
[00:46:32.295 --> 00:46:33.675]  I thought it was weird that there were no police there.
[00:46:33.695 --> 00:46:36.036]  The whole thing felt like a mob.
[00:46:36.157 --> 00:46:40.439]  I actually backed away when I thought what was going to happen.
[00:46:41.179 --> 00:46:47.122]  It was a little bit startling and the police might have actually put a purpose there.
[00:46:48.117 --> 00:46:48.938]  Yeah, that does seem odd.
[00:46:48.978 --> 00:46:50.460]  I mean, you did have a bag of oranges, though.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:53.203]  You could have started to throw those in your defense.
[00:46:53.283 --> 00:46:54.945]  You're armed with oranges in Oakland.
[00:46:56.586 --> 00:46:57.467]  Organic oranges.
[00:46:57.548 --> 00:47:00.110]  Hit them upside the head with some non-GMO oranges.
[00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:01.952]  That might knock some sense into them, huh?
[00:47:02.673 --> 00:47:03.594]  Yeah, armed with oranges.
[00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.816]  At least it's alliteration.
[00:47:07.236 --> 00:47:07.756]  Yeah, indeed.
[00:47:07.796 --> 00:47:08.497]  That's what we gotta do.
[00:47:08.737 --> 00:47:09.797]  It's like a food fight now.
[00:47:09.817 --> 00:47:14.360]  They smash in a window, you hit them with some celery bunches right over the head.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.301]  That way you're stalking them.
[00:47:15.321 --> 00:47:16.021]  You see how that works?
[00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:16.841]  Oh, right.
[00:47:17.242 --> 00:47:18.202]  Cheap humor.
[00:47:18.262 --> 00:47:19.183]  Okay, sorry about that.
[00:47:19.463 --> 00:47:25.706]  I know that a lot of, even amongst this small group, some people try to stop them from being so destructive.
[00:47:26.227 --> 00:47:33.411]  So, I think, I don't know, maybe we need a lot better way to channel energy that young people have.
[00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:35.812]  I mean, just, I don't know.
[00:47:37.165 --> 00:47:50.698]  Well yeah, it does seem very odd, and you may not like this comment, but all you need to stop that is one Whole Foods employee with a pack and a concealed weapon, and that would take care of the whole thing right there.
[00:47:51.739 --> 00:47:52.300]  I know that's not...
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:48:00.361]  That's not the Oakland way to address issues, but, uh, since I'm talking to you from Texas, that's, that's the Texas way to address, uh, uh, violence.
[00:48:00.761 --> 00:48:05.202]  But, um, uh, obviously none of us want to promote violence, so I, I sort of say that in jest.
[00:48:05.242 --> 00:48:08.623]  But, so, uh, where do you think this is all heading, though, in Oakland, Michael?
[00:48:10.603 --> 00:48:14.304]  Well, um, kind of like, pfft, death and taxes.
[00:48:14.384 --> 00:48:18.565]  I don't think this small group of, they wrote this anarchy symbol on the Whole Foods, too.
[00:48:18.585 --> 00:48:19.845]  I don't think they're gonna go anywhere.
[00:48:20.525 --> 00:48:20.945]  So it's like,
[00:48:22.219 --> 00:48:40.449]  I think I focus my energy on what's important and what I think is constructive and I think the labeling GMO campaign in California, I'm a definite activist in that where I'll be helping get people who are inspired by the vision of labeling GMOs in California to then collect signatures
[00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:49.271]  We need 800,000 signatures in this state between the first day we can start, January 1st, and some days shortly after that.
[00:48:49.971 --> 00:48:50.611]  So it's important.
[00:48:50.631 --> 00:48:52.672]  That's where I'm, I mean, that's where I want to go.
[00:48:52.852 --> 00:48:53.912]  I heard something really interesting.
[00:48:53.932 --> 00:49:04.295]  I heard a guy named Woody Tash say something that GMOs are the derivatives of basically exploitation of food.
[00:49:04.315 --> 00:49:09.496]  Just like derivatives were like the tool that created all this financial crash.
[00:49:09.656 --> 00:49:09.816]  Yeah.
[00:49:10.874 --> 00:49:17.578]  Uh, GMOs are like tinkering and toying with a system that has naturally integrity.
[00:49:17.598 --> 00:49:27.544]  You know, food is naturally integrated, but when you do GMOs, you create a system that skews it off its integrity and can lead to the whole collapse of life.
[00:49:28.288 --> 00:49:29.509]  Yeah, that's a good metaphor.
[00:49:29.609 --> 00:49:33.471]  If money is like food, then derivatives are like GMOs.
[00:49:33.511 --> 00:49:35.452]  Yeah, that sounds good.
[00:49:35.872 --> 00:49:37.053]  That makes a lot of sense.
[00:49:37.393 --> 00:49:40.915]  Michael, I want to thank you for taking your time to join us here.
[00:49:40.935 --> 00:49:43.136]  Appreciate all your comments.
[00:49:43.176 --> 00:49:48.659]  By the way, is there a blog or something you have where people can follow more of your observations there?
[00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:50.340]  Yeah, I have a blog.
[00:49:51.735 --> 00:49:56.637]  It's actually at www.rawalityhouse.us.
[00:49:58.158 --> 00:50:05.922]  That's like a reality, but it's rawalityhouse.us.
[00:50:07.963 --> 00:50:09.704]  And that's our project for helping action.
[00:50:15.566 --> 00:50:15.806]  Alright.
[00:50:16.386 --> 00:50:17.167]  Alright, very good.
[00:50:17.207 --> 00:50:17.767]  Fantastic.
[00:50:18.207 --> 00:50:20.468]  Hopefully people got that URL.
[00:50:21.108 --> 00:50:22.209]  I didn't catch it all.
[00:50:22.249 --> 00:50:29.872]  Ever since you interviewed me about Occupy, I might as well tell you that just for the fun of it, I got the other website that also goes to the same site.
[00:50:29.892 --> 00:50:34.994]  It's called RawCupieOakland.com.
[00:50:35.154 --> 00:50:36.995]  RawCupieOakland.com?
[00:50:37.055 --> 00:50:38.675]  Okay, that sounds pretty cool.
[00:50:38.755 --> 00:50:40.256]  But it also goes to the RAL if you have it.
[00:50:41.007 --> 00:50:41.227]  Okay.
[00:50:41.628 --> 00:50:42.108]  Well, very good.
[00:50:42.308 --> 00:50:44.350]  I want to thank you, Michael, for joining us.
[00:50:44.370 --> 00:50:47.272]  It's been a pleasure chatting with you here on the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[00:50:48.213 --> 00:50:49.334]  Thank you so much for having me, Mike.
[00:50:49.915 --> 00:50:50.695]  Keep up the good work.
[00:50:50.895 --> 00:50:51.136]  All right.
[00:50:51.176 --> 00:50:51.636]  Thank you, man.
[00:50:52.016 --> 00:50:52.357]  Take care.
[00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:53.498]  All right.
[00:50:53.658 --> 00:51:03.926]  And for all the regular InfoWars listeners, the Alex Jones fans, I know we just did three segments there talking to people from Oakland, three different guests we have lined up.
[00:51:06.294 --> 00:51:10.478]  You know, I think it's really important to bring in their frontline perspective on exactly what's happening there.
[00:51:13.442 --> 00:51:25.234]  These are people who are in the raw foods community, they're in the healthy eating community, and they believe in liberty, and they believe in freedom, and they believe in honesty, especially corporate transparency.
[00:51:26.275 --> 00:51:41.717]  What's wonderful about all of this is that these are the same people who, once they understand issues like the Federal Reserve, they will naturally oppose that kind of fraudulent modification of the money supply that the Fed is doing.
[00:51:42.734 --> 00:51:47.796]  So really, this is not about left versus right, this is not about progressive versus conservative.
[00:51:48.436 --> 00:52:06.743]  This is about, really, reality versus the fictions that the corporations and the controllers and the globalists are trying to weave into your heads, like a mental viral infection, like a mental inoculation of a deadly cognitive meme of sorts.
[00:52:06.783 --> 00:52:10.304]  I mean, it's really about truth versus fiction.
[00:52:11.064 --> 00:52:16.545]  And the truth is that the controllers out there don't want us to wake up.
[00:52:16.645 --> 00:52:22.867]  They don't want us to do what we're doing, which is to spread truth, to spread information, to ask great questions.
[00:52:23.247 --> 00:52:25.227]  They don't want InfoWars to succeed.
[00:52:25.567 --> 00:52:26.668]  You can bet on that.
[00:52:27.048 --> 00:52:36.750]  And what more, what better reason to go to InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com and you can help defeat the globalists by supporting this organization and the work that it does.
[00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:39.451]  Again, it's a fantastic group.
[00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:48.175]  It's just a super dedicated group of people who are going to be here for the next just many, many hours coming up here, bringing you more great information.
[00:52:48.816 --> 00:53:03.943]  And I really hope to be working with this group long term to help spread the word about vaccines, the dangers of vaccines, the GMOs, food freedom, health freedom, all of these crucial issues that they have been gracious enough to invite me in to comment on.
[00:53:04.463 --> 00:53:08.946]  It's always an honor to be here as part of InfoWars, bringing you that important information.
[00:53:09.466 --> 00:53:11.067]  Now I've got a couple of news items for you.
[00:53:11.087 --> 00:53:12.768]  Some of these will really give you quite a chuckle.
[00:53:12.808 --> 00:53:16.230]  And then we're going to go in a few minutes to Robert Scott Bell.
[00:53:17.051 --> 00:53:19.212]  He's also on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:53:19.412 --> 00:53:22.054]  He has a Sunday show there called the Robert Scott Bell Show.
[00:53:22.514 --> 00:53:26.957]  And he's going to be joining us to give us an update on the Raw Milk Freedom Riders event.
[00:53:27.637 --> 00:53:36.992]  That just took place two days ago in front of the FDA, where courageous raw milk moms were eating milk and cookies in front of the FDA.
[00:53:37.553 --> 00:53:41.279]  Or as Alex would say, Al-Qaeda cookies in front of the FDA.
[00:53:42.575 --> 00:53:44.797]  And that's something that we did.
[00:53:44.877 --> 00:53:48.201]  We also announced InfoWars covered that before it took place.
[00:53:49.182 --> 00:53:53.025]  A lot of very important news about what took place there and the FDA's response to that.
[00:53:53.085 --> 00:53:55.888]  But first, but first, we've got some interesting news.
[00:53:55.948 --> 00:53:56.529]  Here's something.
[00:53:56.909 --> 00:54:01.333]  A couple was lost in an apple orchard and they had to call 911.
[00:54:01.794 --> 00:54:05.037]  Now, I don't know if this was mentioned on the show in the last couple of days.
[00:54:05.257 --> 00:54:06.398]  This news is about two days old.
[00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:09.400]  But the reason I'm mentioning this, check this out.
[00:54:09.761 --> 00:54:15.364]  A couple from, guess what, Massachusetts got lost in an apple orchard.
[00:54:15.944 --> 00:54:16.745]  Oh yeah, here we go.
[00:54:17.265 --> 00:54:18.186]  Show the picture, there it is.
[00:54:18.666 --> 00:54:19.987]  There's the apple orchard.
[00:54:20.687 --> 00:54:25.670]  It is about 200 acres of apples, apple trees.
[00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.792]  And 200 acres is not that big of an orchard.
[00:54:31.142 --> 00:54:33.948]  Jaren says, couldn't you just eat your way out of it?
[00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:36.152]  Right, exactly.
[00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:39.178]  Yeah, follow the trail as long as you can.
[00:54:39.479 --> 00:54:41.382]  Well, they got lost in the apple orchard.
[00:54:42.423 --> 00:54:43.744]  And they called 911.
[00:54:44.124 --> 00:54:45.885]  I saw some of the comments under this story.
[00:54:46.145 --> 00:54:51.369]  The first commenter says, how did I know they were from Massachusetts?
[00:54:51.629 --> 00:54:53.030]  That might be a little uncalled for.
[00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:56.852]  I mean, come on, not everybody in Massachusetts loses their way in an apple orchard.
[00:54:56.892 --> 00:55:05.098]  But the reason that this is funny is because it shows just how much people have lost touch with reality.
[00:55:05.118 --> 00:55:10.101]  I mean, here in Texas, all right, the idea of getting lost on 200 acres
[00:55:12.064 --> 00:55:12.744]  It's hilarious.
[00:55:13.245 --> 00:55:18.006]  I mean, everybody's got a 200-acre ranch or knows somebody with a 200-acre ranch somewhere.
[00:55:18.406 --> 00:55:20.367]  Some people have a 5,000-acre ranch.
[00:55:20.407 --> 00:55:24.348]  Yeah, you could get lost on that, but even then, follow the fence line, people.
[00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.389]  Follow the sun.
[00:55:26.889 --> 00:55:28.509]  You know, don't you know East from West?
[00:55:29.790 --> 00:55:30.990]  They parked their car.
[00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.551]  The news says their car was parked about only half a mile away.
[00:55:34.571 --> 00:55:34.631]  Wow.
[00:55:38.112 --> 00:55:44.339]  And then, as night began to fall, they became frightened that they wouldn't be able to find their way back.
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.702]  Well, that's what the breadcrumbs are for, people.
[00:55:46.742 --> 00:55:47.643]  You should leave breadcrumbs.
[00:55:48.364 --> 00:55:52.048]  And so they called 911 and had to get rescued out of an apple orchard.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:56:01.966]  Folks, if you get lost picking fruit, you're going to have a real hard time dealing with the globalists and the global economic collapse that's coming, believe me.
[00:56:02.386 --> 00:56:04.868]  Maybe you should carry a flashlight with you.
[00:56:04.888 --> 00:56:07.510]  A flashlight, you know?
[00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:11.413]  A magical little device that turns batteries into light.
[00:56:11.633 --> 00:56:12.614]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:56:12.894 --> 00:56:13.535]  Photons.
[00:56:14.115 --> 00:56:16.837]  Right out of the front of that little beam-delivering device.
[00:56:18.678 --> 00:56:19.559]  It works wonders.
[00:56:19.619 --> 00:56:21.100]  And you could also carry a compass, maybe.
[00:56:21.721 --> 00:56:22.942]  But they did have their cell phone.
[00:56:23.562 --> 00:56:24.162]  Yes, indeed.
[00:56:24.202 --> 00:56:26.504]  They did have their cell phones, so they could call 9-1-1.
[00:56:26.784 --> 00:56:29.165]  And I wonder what that call must have been like.
[00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:30.766]  Hello, 9-1-1 operator.
[00:56:31.647 --> 00:56:32.427]  Can we take your call?
[00:56:32.447 --> 00:56:32.687]  Yes.
[00:56:33.147 --> 00:56:34.388]  I'm surrounded by apples.
[00:56:35.649 --> 00:56:38.170]  It's like being attacked by the ghost of Steve Jobs.
[00:56:40.472 --> 00:56:41.492]  How did they get out of that?
[00:56:42.253 --> 00:56:42.753]  Oh, my.
[00:56:44.054 --> 00:56:45.334]  Lost in an apple orchard.
[00:56:46.135 --> 00:56:48.036]  And then in a related story, here we go.
[00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:52.475]  We're going to have Robert Scott Bell on here in a few minutes.
[00:56:52.515 --> 00:56:53.897]  I can't wait for his comments on this.
[00:56:54.758 --> 00:57:02.946]  In a related story, the Bay Area experts weigh in on GPS shoes for Alzheimer's patients.
[00:57:02.966 --> 00:57:04.387]  I don't really have a picture for that, sorry guys.
[00:57:05.148 --> 00:57:07.610]  GPS shoes for Alzheimer's patients.
[00:57:08.476 --> 00:57:14.442]  Alright, so the idea is that your parents or your grandparents, they've got Alzheimer's.
[00:57:15.062 --> 00:57:15.362]  Why?
[00:57:15.623 --> 00:57:24.191]  Well, because they've been drinking all the metals in the water supply and being injected with all the metals from the vaccines and they've been drinking the fluoride and so on and so forth.
[00:57:25.332 --> 00:57:29.115]  We know all about that stuff that people do to give themselves Alzheimer's.
[00:57:30.336 --> 00:57:34.060]  But then these Alzheimer's patients, they tend to wander off.
[00:57:35.798 --> 00:57:39.101]  Of course, if you're this couple in the apple orchard, you don't even need Alzheimer's to do that.
[00:57:39.642 --> 00:57:42.044]  You just go out and start picking apples and it's over.
[00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:43.966]  It's like Dementia City, I guess.
[00:57:44.586 --> 00:57:52.614]  But these people, these Alzheimer's patients, they wander off, and that's dangerous, because they don't know where they are sometimes, they don't know how to get back.
[00:57:52.654 --> 00:57:54.896]  So now, they're pushing GPS shoes.
[00:57:56.317 --> 00:57:57.439]  So that you can track them.
[00:57:57.939 --> 00:58:01.384]  You can bring up a website and you can say, oh, there's Grandpa.
[00:58:01.965 --> 00:58:05.049]  Yeah, on the corner of 4th and Main, once again.
[00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:07.432]  Chugging shots at the Irish bar.
[00:58:07.532 --> 00:58:08.474]  That's not Alzheimer's.
[00:58:08.914 --> 00:58:10.156]  That's something else entirely.
[00:58:12.412 --> 00:58:14.173]  So now they want to push the shoes on us.
[00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:16.673]  Now, Alex warned you about this, if you recall.
[00:58:16.833 --> 00:58:19.294]  Alex warned you about exactly this thing.
[00:58:19.314 --> 00:58:24.175]  He said, look, first they're going to roll out the RFID tracking chips in your pets.
[00:58:24.935 --> 00:58:31.177]  And then they're going to push them on your parents and your grandparents and your Alzheimer's, your senior citizens people.
[00:58:31.617 --> 00:58:35.538]  And then they're going to push them on on your children, because children might get lost too.
[00:58:36.158 --> 00:58:41.400]  And then finally, it's going to be, well, if they're good enough for your children and your grandparents and your dog, then they're going to
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.740]  Push them on to everybody!
[00:58:42.861 --> 00:58:44.121]  Everybody should be tracked!
[00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:45.542]  What if you got lost?
[00:58:46.442 --> 00:58:49.684]  What if you went on a fruit-picking expedition and couldn't find your way back?
[00:58:50.144 --> 00:58:54.066]  Wouldn't you want to be able to press a button and have the authorities locate you by your shoes?
[00:58:56.708 --> 00:58:57.368]  Oh, that's a good one.
[00:58:58.368 --> 00:59:00.509]  Why not just have GPS underwear, for that matter?
[00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:01.470]  I mean, you could lose a shoe.
[00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:05.192]  At least, for the most part, you would probably still have your underwear on.
[00:59:06.516 --> 00:59:11.297]  No matter what kind of fruit you were picking out there in the orchards, gpsunderwear.com.
[00:59:11.597 --> 00:59:14.618]  Somebody patent that before it gets taken by the globalists.
[00:59:16.278 --> 00:59:18.019]  Alright, a little bit of humor here.
[00:59:19.499 --> 00:59:20.019]  Unbelievable.
[00:59:20.199 --> 00:59:25.581]  Alright, Robert Scott Bell is on the phone with us, or I think he's joining us by Skype.
[00:59:25.881 --> 00:59:26.261]  That's great.
[00:59:26.821 --> 00:59:34.143]  So, let's go to Robert now and let's have some coverage of the Raw Milk Freedom Riders event that just took place a couple days ago.
[00:59:36.423 --> 00:59:37.924]  Robert, are you with us, man?
[00:59:37.944 --> 00:59:40.064]  Yeah, Mike, I'm here.
[00:59:40.144 --> 00:59:48.267]  Thanks for having me on board tonight to report on an amazing event, traveling from Pennsylvania on down to the FDA in Washington, D.C.
[00:59:48.327 --> 00:59:56.991]  It was actually quite historic to see what a group of courageous, somewhat angry, but really pleasant moms can do to change the world.
[00:59:57.991 --> 00:59:59.332]  Yeah, well, you were right there.
[00:59:59.372 --> 01:00:03.194]  You were an embedded reporter in that whole caravan.
[01:00:03.634 --> 01:00:05.195]  What was it like there, Robert?
[01:00:05.555 --> 01:00:06.716]  Describe the energy.
[01:00:06.736 --> 01:00:10.638]  I know that Adam Kokesh from Adam vs. the Man was there as well.
[01:00:10.918 --> 01:00:12.418]  Describe the people that you saw.
[01:00:12.578 --> 01:00:19.082]  What actually took place during that really historic protest for food freedom?
[01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.624]  They were really quite revolutionary.
[01:00:21.684 --> 01:00:30.514]  I mean, on one hand, it was really kind of interesting because when you think about doing a revolution, you think of, you know, serious warriors armed to the teeth, etc.
[01:00:30.915 --> 01:00:34.319]  And here I was with a bunch of, you know, homeschooled
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.701]  I mean, these people were amazing.
[01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:48.065]  We get up to Pennsylvania to grab the raw milk, or the illegal FDA contraband, as it's called, and at this point, they're starting to decorate the vans.
[01:00:48.386 --> 01:00:54.989]  I mean, this is not like a revolution I think they would have envisioned back at the time of Patrick Henry or anybody, but it worked nonetheless.
[01:00:55.289 --> 01:01:01.732]  And they start postering the vans, writing, I almost felt like I was back in high school getting ready for the homecoming.
[01:01:02.072 --> 01:01:09.055]  And I was just amused by the scene, because it was so peaceful and so not intimidating.
[01:01:09.356 --> 01:01:15.138]  Yet at the same time, these women had contacted the FDA and said, listen, come and get us.
[01:01:15.358 --> 01:01:16.619]  We're going to get the raw milk.
[01:01:16.699 --> 01:01:24.803]  We know it's a violation of your federal law, and you're going to call us criminals, but we're taking this stuff off the border, over the border, and you come and get us.
[01:01:24.943 --> 01:01:33.210]  Well, yeah, that's a really important point, is that wasn't it Max Cain who called to report a crime to the FDA, right?
[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:40.016]  Yeah, they reported the crime and everything, so it wasn't like these women were sneaking around and hopefully they weren't going to get caught.
[01:01:40.036 --> 01:01:42.398]  I mean, they were literally prepared.
[01:01:42.978 --> 01:01:47.684]  To get arrested and not see their family for 24 hours or however long it would take.
[01:01:48.164 --> 01:01:51.508]  I had the great fortune and opportunity to meet with these women.
[01:01:51.888 --> 01:01:54.291]  Many in their homes, met their little children.
[01:01:54.591 --> 01:01:56.674]  These were kids, none of them were unhealthy.
[01:01:56.694 --> 01:01:58.977]  They were all drinking raw, real milk.
[01:01:59.617 --> 01:02:03.702]  Uh, you know, eating, some of them a pretty paleolithic diet, but the kids were fine.
[01:02:04.142 --> 01:02:08.987]  And I was just amused by the whole scene, at the same time, recognizing the serious nature of it.
[01:02:09.007 --> 01:02:14.493]  I mean, there was two things going on, and being embedded in there, Mike, it was just, just an amazing thing to be part of that history.
[01:02:15.474 --> 01:02:16.915]  Carry on down right to the border.
[01:02:16.955 --> 01:02:23.559]  We fully expected to have state troopers or FDA agents right at the border with Pennsylvania and Maryland stopped.
[01:02:23.579 --> 01:02:27.182]  They took pictures, interviewed by some reporters that were there.
[01:02:27.662 --> 01:02:29.583]  Of course, Adam Kokesh was also filming.
[01:02:29.984 --> 01:02:37.249]  And that was really quite... I stayed in the van because I was literally broadcasting live during this whole event, including through, you know, TV uploads.
[01:02:37.769 --> 01:02:39.490]  And so we continued on down.
[01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:41.592]  We passed a number of troopers along the way.
[01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:43.153]  But the spirits were high.
[01:02:43.213 --> 01:02:44.514]  I was interviewing some of these moms
[01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:45.675]  Wait a minute, wait a minute, Robert.
[01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:54.845]  The troopers did not stop you and search your vans even though they had pre-knowledge that this was a criminal event taking place?
[01:02:55.545 --> 01:03:02.593]  We were nervous a little bit as we approached some troopers on the side of the road, but apparently they were just setting speed traps.
[01:03:02.793 --> 01:03:06.978]  You know, more or less interested in making a ticket quota than they were in these moms.
[01:03:06.998 --> 01:03:09.121]  And it was, you know, literally all over their vans.
[01:03:09.422 --> 01:03:11.544]  There was no question about what was going on here.
[01:03:12.065 --> 01:03:18.113]  And these women actually had their own handcuffs and they were going to handcuff themselves to the milk that they were bringing.
[01:03:19.935 --> 01:03:21.176]  Oh man, that's great stuff.
[01:03:21.456 --> 01:03:25.959]  But, okay, so they went across state lines, they bought the raw milk in Pennsylvania, right?
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:26.640]  Yeah.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.902]  And then they were carrying it across state lines into Maryland.
[01:03:29.922 --> 01:03:32.644]  Now that is a violation of FDA regulations.
[01:03:33.264 --> 01:03:39.569]  Yeah, the prohibition of interstate transport of not drugs, but raw milk, food.
[01:03:39.769 --> 01:03:48.975]  In fact, food that has sustained life on planet Earth for perhaps thousands of years that suddenly, in the span of the last 20 or 30, became illegal and dangerous.
[01:03:49.775 --> 01:03:52.637]  So these women were really, you know, like I said, courageous women.
[01:03:52.677 --> 01:03:59.382]  Let the women lead you in this case, as they have also in the vaccine awareness arena with all the children that are being harmed there.
[01:04:00.022 --> 01:04:02.264]  So yeah, we were witnessing, we were part of this history.
[01:04:02.304 --> 01:04:04.565]  We made our way down to Silver Spring, Maryland.
[01:04:05.026 --> 01:04:09.769]  And as we approached the FDA, that's where it became a little bit nerve-wracking.
[01:04:10.089 --> 01:04:18.975]  The ladies were looking around within the vehicles and we saw lines of police cars and Homeland Security outside the not-Pearly Gates.
[01:04:19.495 --> 01:04:22.178]  Okay, let's get to that in just a second.
[01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:39.076]  But first, how could the FDA have neglected to arrest these raw milk criminals, given that the FDA's position is that raw milk is so dangerous that transporting it across state line for the intent to consume it is such a criminal act?
[01:04:40.598 --> 01:04:42.640]  That it can kill little children?
[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:47.885]  How on earth could they have not arrested these terrible criminals?
[01:04:48.786 --> 01:04:53.591]  Isn't that a gross violation of the FDA's commitment to public safety or something?
[01:04:54.383 --> 01:04:55.344]  Well, you would think so.
[01:04:55.384 --> 01:05:13.682]  I mean, literally, it's on the books, although we would call that law unconstitutional, but the reality is they've, you know, taken part in horrific sting operations, multi-jurisdictional, from federal, state, and local authorities, whether it be in Rossum in California, or whether it be Dan Alger, the Amish farmer in the Baltimore, Maryland area.
[01:05:14.162 --> 01:05:17.784]  Uh, so, you know, you fully expect that they were going to take a hard line on this.
[01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:18.985]  So why didn't they?
[01:05:19.025 --> 01:05:19.765]  It's a good question.
[01:05:19.805 --> 01:05:22.427]  Now, these women did not look like hardened criminals.
[01:05:22.487 --> 01:05:25.368]  They were tenacious in defense of their family and their children.
[01:05:25.729 --> 01:05:27.550]  But they were, you know, absolute sweethearts.
[01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.511]  You know, couldn't have had better hospitality being up there with them.
[01:05:30.531 --> 01:05:31.432]  But as we approached
[01:05:32.032 --> 01:05:33.192]  It was a little nerve-wracking.
[01:05:33.232 --> 01:05:34.392]  Were they going to arrest us?
[01:05:34.672 --> 01:05:38.833]  We pulled up into the park to try and go down into the parking lot.
[01:05:39.093 --> 01:05:41.234]  They stopped us and said, no, you're not allowed in.
[01:05:41.254 --> 01:05:42.074]  You got to turn around.
[01:05:42.454 --> 01:05:44.914]  And they basically sent us across the street into the neighborhood.
[01:05:44.954 --> 01:05:47.855]  So they were not interested in arresting these women at all.
[01:05:47.915 --> 01:05:54.176]  In fact, you know, 100, 150 people were already there with raw milk and, you know, speaking, protesting.
[01:05:54.256 --> 01:05:56.436]  Signs were waving as people were going by.
[01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:59.537]  There was more milk to give away than I ever imagined would be there.
[01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:01.477]  It was like a milk fest.
[01:06:02.118 --> 01:06:03.158]  It was!
[01:06:03.198 --> 01:06:22.383]  I think they were intimidated, honestly, and as we find out, the FDA themselves wrote, you know, made a release, a major release on this day, and we learned that in fact they talked to Liz Reitzig, one of the developers, or let's say the organizers of this event, and they basically said, we're not going to arrest you.
[01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:27.105]  Alright, hold on Robert, we'll get to that, we'll get to that letter in just a second.
[01:06:28.012 --> 01:06:28.952]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:30.273]  Let's get to that letter in just a second.
[01:06:30.293 --> 01:06:38.815]  But first, the issue why they did not arrest these women, let's make sure that this is well understood by those watching and listening.
[01:06:39.255 --> 01:06:43.276]  It is because the FDA operates in darkness, okay?
[01:06:43.517 --> 01:06:44.717]  The FDA operates
[01:06:45.157 --> 01:06:46.438]  They're shrouded by secrecy.
[01:06:46.758 --> 01:06:54.182]  They have a network of spies who infiltrate the raw milk community and try to purchase raw milk from these farmers.
[01:06:54.222 --> 01:06:58.245]  I mean, it is an infiltration network of spies.
[01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:04.368]  This is, with covert cameras, with giving a secret testimony behind the scenes.
[01:07:04.428 --> 01:07:08.631]  Oh yeah, we caught this store, or this farmer selling raw milk.
[01:07:08.671 --> 01:07:11.633]  We caught, these eggs weren't refrigerated.
[01:07:12.213 --> 01:07:12.974]  All these terrible things.
[01:07:13.014 --> 01:07:26.666]  But when you go face to face with the FDA and you say, come arrest us, we're going to drink this milk or even sell this milk right in front of you, right in front of your headquarters, they say, what?
[01:07:26.866 --> 01:07:27.066]  Huh?
[01:07:27.286 --> 01:07:27.527]  What?
[01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:28.668]  What are you talking about?
[01:07:28.868 --> 01:07:30.129]  There's nothing going on.
[01:07:30.669 --> 01:07:31.390]  Nothing to see here.
[01:07:32.751 --> 01:07:38.834]  It shows they're cowardice, and the reality also is that they know how absurd these laws are as well.
[01:07:38.954 --> 01:07:42.735]  You know, we've talked about this would be one thing, because these women don't want war.
[01:07:42.775 --> 01:07:43.876]  They just want to be left alone.
[01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:44.536]  Leave us alone.
[01:07:44.576 --> 01:07:46.877]  Let us care for our kids the way we believe is right.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:49.041]  Well, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:07:49.061 --> 01:07:55.686]  I mean, that's what America is founded on, this fundamental freedom to not have our lives interfered with by the government.
[01:07:55.706 --> 01:08:03.611]  But of course, you know, the raw milk thing, it is the pivotal point of food freedom in America, and that's why this was so important.
[01:08:04.212 --> 01:08:15.941]  Now, let's get to the letter and the conclusion of what the FDA did in this case, because the FDA, essentially, they refused to arrest the women, even though they say they're criminals.
[01:08:17.481 --> 01:08:27.824]  In the letter, then, they revealed, well, we will selectively not arrest certain individuals if we don't want to, but you're still a criminal.
[01:08:28.144 --> 01:08:29.344]  Isn't that what their letter said?
[01:08:29.924 --> 01:08:41.447]  Basically, they said, you know, with interstate sale and commerce distribution of raw milk, the FDA has never taken, now they're going back and saying never, nor does it intend to take, enforcement action against an individual.
[01:08:41.687 --> 01:08:46.471]  Who purchased and transported raw milk across state lines solely for his or her own personal consumption.
[01:08:46.511 --> 01:08:49.633]  Now, I was not aware of this exception to the rule.
[01:08:50.094 --> 01:08:52.256]  I think, as we know, they make it up as they go along.
[01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:58.761]  And I think they realized that had they arrested, because we were, you know, the women were sort of saying it might be good if we were arrested.
[01:08:58.781 --> 01:08:59.802]  Not that they wanted to be.
[01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:07.208]  But if they were, it would have been the greatest embarrassment that the FDA has ever faced among many that are yet to even be revealed.
[01:09:07.728 --> 01:09:09.870]  And at that point, I think it would have been all over for them.
[01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:19.196]  I mean, they're rapidly losing out on the, let's say, the sympathy or empathy of a public that believes still that they might be doing some level of good to protect the public.
[01:09:19.236 --> 01:09:24.220]  I mean, you know, Ron Paul in his wisdom saying, I want to cut them 40% in the first year.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:33.326]  My perspective is they need to be cut 100% at this point because the states can handle food safety much better than a federal bureaucracy could ever do.
[01:09:34.047 --> 01:09:36.690]  I love Ron Paul's strategy of cuts.
[01:09:37.190 --> 01:09:37.791]  It's awesome.
[01:09:38.392 --> 01:09:44.199]  If we could get him into the White House, man, all the bureaucrats in Washington would be looking for new jobs.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.725]  And that might be a very good thing indeed, to get him off of our backs for the most part.
[01:09:48.745 --> 01:09:49.506]  Absolutely.
[01:09:50.067 --> 01:09:51.288]  No, go ahead, Robert, with a comment.
[01:09:51.969 --> 01:10:00.471]  Mike, this strategy is astounding because it showed me firsthand the power of the individual, but also the power of moms.
[01:10:00.671 --> 01:10:05.332]  Unarmed moms that simply carried the weapon, if you will, of raw, real milk.
[01:10:05.772 --> 01:10:17.175]  And how it, you know, a multi-billion dollar agency backed down to this peaceful, non-violent, Gandhi-like demonstration simply to provide food to their fellow man and woman and child.
[01:10:17.835 --> 01:10:19.956]  And that shows, I think it should show,
[01:10:20.436 --> 01:10:30.886]  That the enemy, although it is intimidating, and they, you know, they have some level of guns, and they are willing to utilize violence, when confronted in this peaceful way, can be pushed back.
[01:10:30.966 --> 01:10:37.272]  Now, I'm not under the illusion that this is all over at this point, but I think this victory is something that is not pyrrhic.
[01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:45.280]  It's a very real victory that should really be a lightning rod for others around the country to recognize that the most powerful tool we have is our consent.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:53.162]  And withdrawing that consent, as these moms have, to say, listen, we don't care what you say the law is, we're going across the border, we're coming back, come and get us.
[01:10:53.782 --> 01:10:57.443]  It puts these bureaucrats in a state of recognition of who they really are.
[01:10:57.903 --> 01:10:58.443]  Cowards.
[01:10:58.923 --> 01:11:07.666]  Abject cowards who do not deserve to be labeled Americans as long as they're enforcing these illegal, unconstitutional provisions within the law.
[01:11:08.086 --> 01:11:10.666]  Well yeah, because where do they stop with all of this?
[01:11:11.306 --> 01:11:13.027]  It gets pretty crazy, and yet,
[01:11:14.244 --> 01:11:24.453]  It comes back to the importance of having the freedom to speak out, having the freedom to have the real journalism, like what you just did, Robert, by being embedded with that group of moms.
[01:11:24.873 --> 01:11:25.954]  That's real journalism.
[01:11:25.974 --> 01:11:32.460]  I mean, you'll notice, hey, CNN wasn't there, ABC wasn't there, Fox News wasn't there.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.581]  How come they didn't have reporters riding along?
[01:11:34.782 --> 01:11:38.244]  Because they don't want to draw attention to the fact that we should have food freedom, you see.
[01:11:39.225 --> 01:11:42.788]  It was you and Russia TV and Natural News and InfoWars.
[01:11:42.868 --> 01:11:46.371]  I mean, folks, this is why your support is really crucial.
[01:11:47.352 --> 01:11:52.075]  The fundraising right now at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com is up to, I believe, $142,000.
[01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:58.820]  There's still a lot to go, so please consider your support at that website.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.481]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:00.462]  You can check it out.
[01:12:01.182 --> 01:12:01.883]  And yeah, look at that, $142,000.
[01:12:03.664 --> 01:12:06.405]  A thousand dollars and much more to go.
[01:12:06.445 --> 01:12:21.532]  This is money that's going to be well spent around here at InfoWars.com on bringing you more truth and asking more questions of the globalists and the Federal Reserve and the FDA and all of those who say they're protecting us when in fact they tend to be taking away our rights instead.
[01:12:21.572 --> 01:12:25.914]  Now, Robert, I'm going to get a little wild with you here on this topic.
[01:12:27.615 --> 01:12:29.156]  How far are they going to push this?
[01:12:29.216 --> 01:12:40.004]  Because technically, technically, if you had moms with infants who are breastfeeding, if they drive across state lines, aren't they carrying raw milk in their own breasts?
[01:12:40.144 --> 01:12:44.267]  Is the FDA going to outlaw women's breasts next?
[01:12:44.847 --> 01:12:59.203]  Well, we see that the issue of pasteurization is really the issue because women's breasts, in fact, engorged with milk, present some level of competition to the agribusiness, big agribusiness farming practices, if you will.
[01:12:59.804 --> 01:13:04.088]  So it isn't too far afield this idea of pasteurizing breast milk, mandating it.
[01:13:04.429 --> 01:13:12.677]  In fact, because there are, let's say, moms who are not able to produce milk and there are actually communities where moms get together and provide breast milk for other babies.
[01:13:13.077 --> 01:13:20.585]  And there has been some push to have that forced pasteurization impact on human breast milk before it can be given to another baby.
[01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.327]  Of course, that would utterly destroy
[01:13:22.887 --> 01:13:35.293]  The nutritional integrity of the product, if you will call it a product, so it isn't too far afield of what has been already proposed within a federal or state guidelines in regards to human breast milk.
[01:13:35.753 --> 01:13:36.854]  How far will they push it?
[01:13:36.894 --> 01:13:43.057]  I think right now, you know, is this the, you know, the shot heard around the world for food freedom?
[01:13:43.477 --> 01:13:48.900]  And this leads to something far bigger because if people see how a few women, I mean it wasn't a lot,
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:58.026]  A few women have taken down, to some degree, that multi-billion dollar federal agency, with very little money, a shoestring budget.
[01:13:58.046 --> 01:14:10.814]  And when you talk about, you know, what the new media is doing, like what you do with Natural News, like what Alex Jones does with InfoWars, my gosh, on a shoestring, the world is changing because the First Amendment, the free press, is being restored.
[01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:14.016]  Not because we're asking permission of the government or any
[01:14:14.196 --> 01:14:14.676]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:14:14.696 --> 01:14:16.217]  People are hungry for the truth.
[01:14:16.277 --> 01:14:17.478]  That's why there is so much support.
[01:14:17.538 --> 01:14:18.358]  It's incredible.
[01:14:18.418 --> 01:14:19.159]  People are donating.
[01:14:19.179 --> 01:14:22.140]  By the minute right now, there is an 800 number you can call.
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:22.960]  It's triple eight.
[01:14:34.506 --> 01:14:51.614]  That is 888-253-3139 to offer your support to the InfoWars media system here that is bringing you not just the InfoWars nightly news every weeknight, but of course also the Alex Jones Radio Show every single weekday.
[01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.935]  And Robert just mentioned that we're doing this on a shoestring.
[01:14:55.275 --> 01:15:01.218]  Well, really, yeah, compared to the globalists who are tossing around not just billions of dollars, but even trillions of dollars,
[01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:11.687]  If you consider what's going on here at Infowars, the power and the reach of this information with just a few hundred thousand dollars in an event like this, it's amazing!
[01:15:12.428 --> 01:15:15.091]  Your donation is highly leveraged.
[01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:22.818]  And you know, as the guy who runs Natural News, I know what it takes in terms of money to just tell the truth.
[01:15:22.878 --> 01:15:23.759]  It's not free.
[01:15:24.299 --> 01:15:28.962]  Okay, the bandwidth that you're using right now to watch this, it isn't free, it costs something.
[01:15:29.343 --> 01:15:31.604]  The cameras in this studio, they're not free.
[01:15:31.644 --> 01:15:33.666]  Some of them are over $5,000 each.
[01:15:34.066 --> 01:15:36.347]  You know, the employees, they gotta be paid too.
[01:15:36.768 --> 01:15:42.392]  I mean, everything costs money just to tell you the truth, and you don't see the government showing up, hey, have some grant money.
[01:15:42.952 --> 01:15:44.593]  You know, like they do with the mainstream media.
[01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:49.097]  They pay them off to make sure they keep running the White House version of the news.
[01:15:49.377 --> 01:15:55.462]  You don't see, there's no big checks coming in to InfoWars from the government or the Rockefeller Foundation or anything like that.
[01:15:55.823 --> 01:15:56.864]  This is up to you!
[01:15:56.884 --> 01:16:02.108]  If you wanted to continue, please consider supporting it at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com.
[01:16:02.468 --> 01:16:03.329]  Now back to you, Robert.
[01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:07.512]  By the way, I really want to thank you for covering that event.
[01:16:08.493 --> 01:16:12.975]  What do you think about this issue of this couple that got lost in the apple orchard in Massachusetts?
[01:16:12.995 --> 01:16:14.416]  Have you ever heard of that happening before?
[01:16:15.177 --> 01:16:19.059]  Well, you know, you and I talked earlier about heavy metals.
[01:16:19.259 --> 01:16:25.062]  And I have to assume that these people may be loaded with heavy metals if they can't find their way out of an apple orchard.
[01:16:25.102 --> 01:16:28.644]  And we're going to have to look at detoxifying this couple if they've survived their ordeal.
[01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:32.851]  Well, yeah, maybe.
[01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:35.873]  Copper toxicity, aluminum toxicity, mercury.
[01:16:35.913 --> 01:16:39.276]  Well, hey, there's mercury and aluminum in many vaccines.
[01:16:39.316 --> 01:16:41.398]  There's copper in your water pipes.
[01:16:41.438 --> 01:16:42.659]  There's lead.
[01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:48.743]  I mean, wasn't even the Halloween face paint for children, a lot of that was found to have high levels of lead in it.
[01:16:49.184 --> 01:16:51.466]  What a wonderful little Halloween gift for your children, huh?
[01:16:52.046 --> 01:16:52.927]  Yeah, well, exactly.
[01:16:52.967 --> 01:17:08.377]  I mean, listen, I understand some people can be absent-minded and get lost in places, but, you know, the idea or the understanding here is that the entire American continent, the people, most of them, if you will, not those that tend to, you know, listen to you or Alex or others that listen to the show,
[01:17:09.597 --> 01:17:26.704]  They have an awareness, I think partly or maybe a large part due to the fact that they're choosing better foods, they're detoxifying their bodies, they can start seeing clearly, they're unraveling the dangerous vaccines and undoing them or even not giving them to their children so that they have a chance to actually see and think and act clearly.
[01:17:28.425 --> 01:17:32.568]  Look at the insanity, and you wrote about this on Natural News, the insanity of people.
[01:17:32.868 --> 01:17:34.690]  What are they politically choosing?
[01:17:34.750 --> 01:17:36.011]  A Democrat or Republican?
[01:17:36.431 --> 01:17:39.374]  Outside of Ron Paul, I mean, they're choosing the same disaster.
[01:17:39.694 --> 01:17:42.857]  How could this be explained except by heavy metal toxicity?
[01:17:43.457 --> 01:17:44.678]  I do not know, Robert.
[01:17:44.778 --> 01:17:45.298]  I do not know.
[01:17:45.338 --> 01:17:49.060]  I mean, maybe heavy metals is part of the explanation.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:56.704]  It certainly brought down the Roman Empire, or at least played a big part in the poisoning of the minds of the Roman people, lead poisoning through the aqueducts.
[01:17:56.724 --> 01:17:58.505]  That's a classic example out of history.
[01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:05.588]  Could it be that our modern civilization is obviously suffering a downfall right now?
[01:18:05.988 --> 01:18:09.110]  Things are crashing in many ways.
[01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:14.972]  You know, the money supply, the ethics, the corporate ethics out there, the agricultural system, and so on.
[01:18:15.592 --> 01:18:23.156]  Could it be that we're suffering our planet's second major metals toxicity crisis after the Roman Empire?
[01:18:24.016 --> 01:18:27.237]  There are probably more in history that we just aren't aware of at the moment.
[01:18:27.277 --> 01:18:31.378]  Are you aware of any more in history of metals destroying a civilization?
[01:18:31.958 --> 01:18:41.841]  Yeah, not on the scale of ancient Rome, but certainly from the standpoint of historical records or reference points to other heavy metals like uranium and nuclear downfall.
[01:18:42.461 --> 01:18:44.202]  That may be in evidence, if you will.
[01:18:44.862 --> 01:18:59.248]  But certainly we've seen, you know, in a contemporary sense, those that work in the metal and smelting industry or those that were the so-called hatters of centuries past, the mad hatters as they were called, working with mercury on the felt.
[01:18:59.708 --> 01:19:08.812]  And of course the dental profession, which still has the highest suicide rate of any profession, medical profession, not too far behind, but the dental profession is still working with mercury.
[01:19:09.292 --> 01:19:13.274]  Of course, those that still embrace mercury and vaccinations.
[01:19:13.594 --> 01:19:20.056]  I mean, these people have to be going mad also because of the damage that they're doing to these children, whether they are consciously aware of it or not.
[01:19:20.517 --> 01:19:21.917]  I mean, it is a brutal thing.
[01:19:21.997 --> 01:19:30.621]  It is reducing, purposefully, I think, the consciousness of these children so that they grow up to be slaves, not free humans, not free sovereign humans.
[01:19:31.261 --> 01:19:42.255]  And we can see that the use of metals in this way, fluoride as well, increasing the uptake of heavy metals, increasing or lowering, I should say, the awareness potential of any human at any age.
[01:19:42.836 --> 01:19:48.763]  And so these, as well, we see the controversy of the Gardasil against the HPV that doesn't cause cervical cancer.
[01:19:49.824 --> 01:19:54.987]  We've covered that on the air and of course Alex Jones covered that so well with Infowars.
[01:20:05.953 --> 01:20:06.593]  Wait a second, Robert.
[01:20:06.613 --> 01:20:09.054]  There's another breaking story I want to get your comments on.
[01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:20.978]  Just broke, what was it, two nights ago, the CDC has been caught covering up and distorting some data linking mercury-containing vaccines to autism.
[01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.759]  That was some big breaking news.
[01:20:22.779 --> 01:20:24.360]  Can you give us a quick rundown on that story?
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.260]  Because I know you covered it.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.440]  Huge, yeah.
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.402]  I interviewed Brian Hooker, the Ph.D.
[01:20:28.442 --> 01:20:32.284]  last week, who's been gathering through Freedom of Information Act requests.
[01:20:32.324 --> 01:20:35.185]  In fact, on the show, I said, how did you do this?
[01:20:35.225 --> 01:20:41.469]  Because after you set up a pattern of FOIAs, they start basically denying them, because they see it's coming from the state.
[01:20:41.489 --> 01:20:46.211]  He says he enlisted every one of his family members to distant relatives, and they were going after this for years.
[01:20:46.772 --> 01:20:52.315]  And he found out, in fact, that the five studies that the CDC claims cleared
[01:20:53.015 --> 01:21:08.004]  Mercury-based orthomerosol, that preservative in vaccines, and vaccines in general as the cause of autism, or the autism spectrum, all five in fact, not four, not three, not two, not one, all five were in fact fraudulent.
[01:21:08.524 --> 01:21:17.310]  They're devoid of real science, and in fact the entire CDC may come crashing down with this revelation as it becomes more and more obvious.
[01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:19.271]  Now, the old media, as you know, is not
[01:21:19.491 --> 01:21:29.536]  Going to cover this, let's say, reluctantly, if anything they will eventually, but we are now, you know, breaking it, you're breaking it, Alex Jones is breaking it, and this is a story that is not going away.
[01:21:29.576 --> 01:21:36.380]  The entire vaccine complex is going to come crumbling down eventually when we'll look back and say how barbaric that we ever fell for their lies.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.441]  Yeah, well, wait a minute, Robert.
[01:21:37.521 --> 01:21:40.402]  How were the data altered in those five studies?
[01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.943]  Specifically, what did they do?
[01:21:41.983 --> 01:21:42.904]  Did they remove
[01:21:43.684 --> 01:21:44.044]  Data?
[01:21:44.104 --> 01:21:45.804]  Did they change the data?
[01:21:45.824 --> 01:21:46.985]  Did they massage the data?
[01:21:47.225 --> 01:21:49.945]  As you know, they like to massage data there at the CDC.
[01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:51.746]  They're like massage therapists, almost.
[01:21:52.166 --> 01:21:55.366]  Brian Hooker, in fact, went through that and detailed it.
[01:21:55.706 --> 01:22:09.489]  Indeed, they eliminated certain data pools that showed what they didn't want to show because these were preordained reports, much like the Flexner Report of 1910 that ushered in petrochemical, pharmaceutical, pseudoscientific medicine in the 20th century.
[01:22:09.829 --> 01:22:13.050]  These were reports designed to prove something that they had to prove
[01:22:13.530 --> 01:22:24.757]  In order to throw off the hunt, throw off the scent, because even in the 90s, as increases in autism were becoming evidenced, many parents were beginning to be much more reluctant to allow their children to be vaccinated.
[01:22:24.777 --> 01:22:30.960]  Of course, with the work of, you know, you've interviewed him, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, and this had to be shut down.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.562]  And so there had to be preordained reports that they could point to.
[01:22:34.862 --> 01:22:36.343]  And in fact, Thorson, remember him?
[01:22:36.403 --> 01:22:37.264]  He was one of the guys.
[01:22:37.824 --> 01:22:46.206]  Thorson, a CDC investigator, indicted by a federal grand jury in Atlanta for accusations of money laundering of CDC grant money, correct?
[01:22:46.766 --> 01:22:56.448]  Yeah, now imagine if that were someone on our side of the scientific realm, like the Geyers, this father-son team, PhD medical doctors, that had found this out.
[01:22:56.508 --> 01:23:03.130]  Had they, you know, money laundered and left the country, do you think that would have been front page news in every paper around the world?
[01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:04.070]  Oh yeah, of course.
[01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:06.431]  And they completely ignored Thorson.
[01:23:07.423 --> 01:23:07.963]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:08.544 --> 01:23:08.984]  Exactly.
[01:23:09.004 --> 01:23:15.208]  They just decide that that's not news, it's not important, they don't want people to cover it, just like they didn't have any reporters at the Raw Milk event.
[01:23:15.609 --> 01:23:21.833]  They're not covering the CDC data alteration story, but boy, they sure go after Wakefield.
[01:23:21.893 --> 01:23:26.837]  Even when he didn't, when he did not alter his data, they still accuse him of doing so.
[01:23:27.947 --> 01:23:47.854]  And that brings to light, again, Mike, the reason why what you're doing is so important, what Alex Jones is doing is so important, and why people need to support these efforts, because, again, no grants from government, no quarter from government, and certainly no pharmaceutical money, no oil money is supporting this, there are no special, I mean, it's literally people, it's like the Ron Paul campaign to wake people up.
[01:23:48.134 --> 01:23:51.155]  It's a lot of people that are waking up and saying, I've had enough of it!
[01:23:51.475 --> 01:23:57.337]  I'm not waiting, I'm not asking for permission, it's time to take it over, and we're doing it with an end around.
[01:23:57.597 --> 01:24:07.526]  Through creating the new media, which is like the old, old media when it was a free press, it is a free press right here, right now, what you're hearing on this InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:24:08.187 --> 01:24:09.268]  Yeah, it's really crucial.
[01:24:09.308 --> 01:24:15.113]  In fact, I wanted to get your comments about the role of independent media today, so let's shift to that topic.
[01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:25.363]  As we've already covered the CDC in some detail there, but I know we're going to be covering that more on naturalnews.com later on if you're interested in covering it.
[01:24:25.463 --> 01:24:28.405]  Probably you'll see some of those articles on infowars.com as well.
[01:24:28.906 --> 01:24:35.552]  I know Kurt Nimmo is always interested in some of the more investigative reports that we're turning up and we share them here.
[01:24:37.433 --> 01:24:46.578]  Robert, let's get to the big issue of why the independent new media is crucial for the protection of freedom in our nation.
[01:24:47.158 --> 01:24:50.960]  You are a significant operator in the new media.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.602]  You're part of the GCN, the Genesis Communications Network with Ted Anderson.
[01:24:55.722 --> 01:24:59.144]  You work with Natural News on a radio show.
[01:24:59.785 --> 01:25:02.526]  You've been in the industry a long time.
[01:25:02.546 --> 01:25:05.448]  You watch and listen to Alex Jones.
[01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:07.429]  You see what I'm doing and others out there.
[01:25:07.989 --> 01:25:18.775]  In your opinion, Robert, why is it crucial that we continue, Infowars in particular, because that's the focus here today, have the financial support to continue?
[01:25:18.915 --> 01:25:21.617]  Why does that matter to our collective future, Robert?
[01:25:22.523 --> 01:25:27.687]  Well, the first amendment for a free press was really what kept, you know, the government in check.
[01:25:27.727 --> 01:25:31.450]  And government, of course, was the, you know, the great threat to liberty.
[01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:33.132]  It always was from the very foundation.
[01:25:33.192 --> 01:25:37.435]  It was a risky proposition to, you know, basically have a federal government.
[01:25:37.515 --> 01:25:38.536]  And our founders knew it.
[01:25:38.576 --> 01:25:39.577]  The framers knew it, even.
[01:25:40.117 --> 01:25:59.972]  And the free press was able to call things out that, you know, the crony, if you will, capitalism as we call it now, which is what the press is today, part of that crony capitalistic structure, is such that these, let's say, illicit, illegal activities and sometimes life-terminating activities of government are covered up or applauded even.
[01:26:00.612 --> 01:26:08.077]  By that old media, you know, the media conglomerates that, you know, can trace back up to the, you know, the few families that are controlling a lot of these things and on beyond that.
[01:26:08.718 --> 01:26:22.568]  And so, supporting this is all, you know, I'll give you one example, not to toot your own horn, Mike, but, you know, it's something that's very recent, fresh in my mind, is your coverage of this product recently, and, you know, you can mention if you want, but basically, that the FDA supposedly,
[01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:34.574]  If we go back to the dawn of the FDA, we have Harvey Wiley, who was really sincere about his efforts, the Pure Food and Drug Act, to keep adulterated toxic poisons out of the food supply, which may have been a legitimate role.
[01:26:35.054 --> 01:26:42.437]  But of course it was corrupted and bought out by the pharmaceutical interests as well, the German chemical companies as well, and that took everything out of the equation.
[01:26:42.477 --> 01:26:45.479]  Now the FDA became the opposite of what it may have been initially.
[01:26:45.879 --> 01:26:46.400]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:51.864]  I mean, we look to the FDA to, or at least the mainstream people look to the FDA to protect them.
[01:26:52.305 --> 01:26:54.267]  That's what they think the FDA is doing.
[01:26:54.747 --> 01:26:58.831]  But in reality, the FDA is in bed with the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:26:58.911 --> 01:27:00.192]  It's in bed with the vaccines.
[01:27:00.552 --> 01:27:09.000]  Now, there's a certain segment of the FDA, the Office of Criminal Investigations, let's say, that is nailing, let's say, doctors who are injecting people with
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:10.581]  Fraudulent vaccines.
[01:27:10.961 --> 01:27:11.782]  That's going on.
[01:27:12.123 --> 01:27:13.184]  They catch those people.
[01:27:13.504 --> 01:27:17.968]  Or people who are importing fraud, you know, counterfeit drugs or things like that.
[01:27:17.988 --> 01:27:28.057]  There's some really wacky stuff that goes on out there and the OCI actually serves some, you know, some useful role in going after the real hardcore criminal crooks.
[01:27:28.117 --> 01:27:34.844]  But by and large, the FDA is just out there pounding vitamins and pounding supplements and trying to
[01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:41.386]  Make them illegal, and then pushing drugs and keeping them on the market even though those drugs are killing people.
[01:27:41.426 --> 01:27:52.410]  So, you know, the FDA, it's sort of, it has abandoned its core principles and left us with, like, we gotta walk through the minefield now ourselves and figure it out because they're not really helping us.
[01:27:53.055 --> 01:27:54.556]  Yeah, long ago they abandoned it.
[01:27:54.596 --> 01:27:57.177]  Now the American people are finally waking up to that reality.
[01:27:57.477 --> 01:27:59.138]  And you mentioned about counterfeit drugs.
[01:27:59.278 --> 01:28:06.221]  I thought one of the funniest things I remember hearing in recent years was that they were warning Americans against drugs imported from Canada, right?
[01:28:06.241 --> 01:28:07.702]  That they were really... Yeah.
[01:28:08.582 --> 01:28:15.224]  And I was like, what about the drugs here in America that you approve that are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans every year?
[01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:17.224]  What is not dangerous about that?
[01:28:17.844 --> 01:28:19.845]  And so, you know, that's where they've lost their mind.
[01:28:19.885 --> 01:28:23.886]  They don't understand real issues of safety when we know what is really harming.
[01:28:23.906 --> 01:28:27.687]  And of course, the supplements themselves are, by and large, not killing anybody.
[01:28:27.727 --> 01:28:32.928]  But on the occasion, on the chance that somebody does something that adulterates a supplement,
[01:28:33.328 --> 01:28:35.289]  The free press calls it out.
[01:28:35.329 --> 01:28:50.835]  That happened recently with Natural News and my goodness, within 24 hours, 36 hours, what happened with the free press is that it would have taken a year or two and millions of dollars of taxpayer funds to do what was done by a free press calling danger where danger really existed.
[01:28:51.055 --> 01:28:52.196]  Yeah, yeah, clearly.
[01:28:52.216 --> 01:28:59.064]  I mean, it's crucial that the free press, the new media here exists to be able to ask these questions.
[01:28:59.104 --> 01:29:09.216]  And again, some of the things that InfoWars is focused on is asking those questions like, hey, how come Ron Paul isn't being given the airtime that he deserves as really the only
[01:29:11.258 --> 01:29:15.499]  An intelligent presidential candidate who can lay out a plan for a balanced budget.
[01:29:15.819 --> 01:29:17.660]  Now, you've interviewed Ron Paul before.
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:32.623]  What are your thoughts, to shift a bit to politics, we've only got a few minutes left here with you, Robert, but on the political side, what's your take on now Cain, Herman Cain being pushed out there as a solution, even though he's a Federal Reserve insider?
[01:29:32.643 --> 01:29:34.444]  Yeah, Cain is funny.
[01:29:34.464 --> 01:29:40.245]  He's the only guy in one minute that can reverse his position every ten seconds and not realize it.
[01:29:41.306 --> 01:29:42.726]  You know, I don't know how he does that.
[01:29:42.766 --> 01:29:44.127]  I don't know if it's a talent or a fault.
[01:29:44.227 --> 01:29:49.328]  I can't make out, but yes, he should be disqualified just on the basis that he was a former Federal Reserve Chairman.
[01:29:49.368 --> 01:29:50.228]  That alone should do it.
[01:29:50.869 --> 01:29:57.510]  But yeah, I've had the great fortune of interviewing Ron Paul over the years as well, and I tell you, he's always been in the corner of freedom.
[01:29:57.670 --> 01:30:06.873]  Of course, me as a homeopath, someone who supported me in my efforts and endeavors to get natural medicine out to the people, and he's an MD, didn't bother him in the least.
[01:30:07.393 --> 01:30:12.197]  And he, you know, the man of integrity like no other that I'd ever met in politics for sure.
[01:30:12.777 --> 01:30:14.799]  And certainly they don't want him to be president.
[01:30:15.379 --> 01:30:27.808]  But as we've seen, a few mobs can roll back the federal bureaucracy by standing up for liberty, by not cowering in fear, by being willing to be arrested through their civil disobedience.
[01:30:28.309 --> 01:30:30.730]  And more of that needs to be done in consciousness.
[01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:32.592]  These women were not unconscious at all.
[01:30:33.112 --> 01:30:38.877]  Whereas some of the Occupy Wall Street people are not fully conscious, although they have a discontent that may be legitimate.
[01:30:39.357 --> 01:30:48.465]  What we've got to do is really stop believing anything that is said in the old media and support these new media outlets like InfoWars as well in this way.
[01:30:48.806 --> 01:30:54.390]  And then a Ron Paul for President becomes a reality, not something that's just a fantasy.
[01:30:55.356 --> 01:30:56.697]  Yeah, well said, Robert.
[01:30:57.157 --> 01:31:02.180]  You were right on the money on that issue, and I really appreciate you joining us here.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:07.043]  Thanks for taking the time to offer us your ideas here on the InfoWars Money Bomb, Robert.
[01:31:07.063 --> 01:31:07.983]  Good to check in with you.
[01:31:08.524 --> 01:31:11.946]  Thanks, Mike Adams, and say thanks to Alex Jones for all his good work for me.
[01:31:12.026 --> 01:31:13.927]  I really appreciate everything that's being done.
[01:31:14.347 --> 01:31:16.348]  I certainly will if we can find him.
[01:31:16.368 --> 01:31:21.931]  He got out of his chair here and just vanished.
[01:31:21.951 --> 01:31:30.554]  I'm not sure where he is, but obviously he's taking a break because he's got a lot ahead, a lot of hard work, and thank you, Robert, for your segment there.
[01:31:30.594 --> 01:31:32.215]  Great information from Robert Scott Bell.
[01:31:32.655 --> 01:31:38.118]  Now, before we get to the top of this hour, can you give us an overhead shot here, guys?
[01:31:38.238 --> 01:31:40.519]  A couple of videos that are in the warehouse back there.
[01:31:40.539 --> 01:31:42.700]  I actually went through the warehouse.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:50.389]  To find what videos that I would personally recommend if a friend came to me and they said, hey, what should I be watching?
[01:31:50.409 --> 01:31:52.010]  Here are a couple of them.
[01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:53.672]  A little reflection on that one.
[01:31:53.973 --> 01:31:55.895]  The World According to Monsanto here.
[01:31:56.356 --> 01:31:58.919]  And then also Scientists Under Attack.
[01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:01.342]  And this one has Jeffrey Smith in it.
[01:32:01.382 --> 01:32:02.783]  This is a very important film.
[01:32:03.604 --> 01:32:06.867]  And, uh, The World According to Monsanto is by Marie Monique Robin.
[01:32:06.887 --> 01:32:11.491]  Uh, this is, uh, here it says right here, from Agent Orange to Genetically Modified Crops.
[01:32:12.231 --> 01:32:18.096]  Uh, these two films will absolutely blow your mind and open your mind on these issues.
[01:32:18.136 --> 01:32:27.224]  And if you're looking for something to give to someone, uh, as the, the holiday season is coming up, uh, you, you may want to consider getting a few of these from the Info Wars store.
[01:32:28.044 --> 01:32:31.106]  And the guys are in the back there ready to ship these out to you.
[01:32:31.126 --> 01:32:34.468]  They've got inventory on both of these films as well as many others out there.
[01:32:35.128 --> 01:32:37.509]  Many of Alex Jones' documentaries.
[01:32:38.190 --> 01:32:39.770]  And they are ready to ship those out.
[01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:43.112]  That's another way that you can help support the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:32:43.412 --> 01:32:47.014]  It's not just about making a donation, although that's a good idea as well.
[01:32:47.415 --> 01:32:50.036]  But you can also support the store here.
[01:32:50.556 --> 01:32:51.117]  And by the way,
[01:32:52.402 --> 01:32:58.749]  Just so you know, I don't have any financial ties whatsoever to these movies or even this organization.
[01:32:59.029 --> 01:33:00.731]  I'm always here on a volunteer basis.
[01:33:01.231 --> 01:33:05.916]  That's because I believe in the mission of what Alex is doing here and what the Infowars team is doing.
[01:33:06.337 --> 01:33:07.618]  I believe in freedom of the press.
[01:33:07.978 --> 01:33:08.819]  I believe in liberty.
[01:33:08.959 --> 01:33:10.060]  I believe in the Bill of Rights.
[01:33:10.461 --> 01:33:11.722]  I believe in the Constitution.
[01:33:12.083 --> 01:33:13.184]  I believe in Ron Paul.
[01:33:13.684 --> 01:33:21.507]  All right, I believe in everything, the core principles of what InfoWars stands for, and that's exactly why I'm here.
[01:33:21.847 --> 01:33:29.949]  In fact, that's the only reason why I'm here, because principle is what we've got to stand up for today in this InfoWar that is taking place.
[01:33:29.989 --> 01:33:36.511]  All right, now coming up, I'm going to go to a video, let's see, Homeland Security taking over Walmart.
[01:33:36.551 --> 01:33:39.752]  That's a little video segment coming up here in just a few seconds.
[01:33:40.412 --> 01:33:41.733]  I'm not sure if I'm coming back
[01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:45.311]  All right, Alex will be back in five minutes.
[01:33:45.671 --> 01:33:50.294]  So if Alex is back, then I'm saying goodbye and thanks for having me on.
[01:33:50.334 --> 01:33:54.817]  If Alex doesn't make it back, I might be on for just a couple of minutes to turn it back over to Alex.
[01:33:54.857 --> 01:34:01.781]  But in either case, it has been my honor and my pleasure to host the last hour and a half for you here on the InfoWars Money Bomb.
[01:34:01.821 --> 01:34:02.661]  I hope you enjoyed it.
[01:34:02.921 --> 01:34:04.322]  Thanks for staying tuned.
[01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:05.443]  Watch this segment.
[01:34:08.422 --> 01:34:12.046]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:15.450]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:34:15.690 --> 01:34:20.455]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:34:20.475 --> 01:34:26.742]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:34:26.882 --> 01:34:29.125]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:34:29.645 --> 01:34:30.805]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:34:30.825 --> 01:34:31.546]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:34:31.566 --> 01:34:33.826]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:34:33.866 --> 01:34:35.147]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:34:35.387 --> 01:34:38.067]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
