[00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:09.711]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:11.173]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:12.855]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:17.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.765]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.002]  It's May 5th, 2011.
[00:00:27.722 --> 00:00:29.563]  It's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:36.186]  I'm your host, Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for PrisonPlanet.com, filling in for Alex today.
[00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:53.633]  And we've got two huge guests coming up over the course of the next 90 minutes to discuss this unraveling Osama Bin Laden fable, both of whom held highly influential positions within the US government and both of whom have
[00:00:54.193 --> 00:01:03.135]  vocally savaged this Bin Laden narrative that has been put out by the White House for the fairytale that it is.
[00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:22.079]  The guests are former Assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts, and of course, the third installment of our interview with Steve R. Pachenik, who worked as a top spymaster in no less than five US administrations.
[00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:30.923]  Cannot be called a black helicopter conspiracy fantasist, as the Time Magazine article yesterday would have it, of course.
[00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:38.747]  They're afraid to address any of the issues that Pchenik has raised over the course of the last two days on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:59.245]  We've got InfoWars video guru Rob Jacobson coming up live reporting from Ground Zero later on in this, actually in the next segment, as Obama gets ready to pull off his contrived photo op, mimicking how George W. Bush stood on the rubble of the Twin Towers shortly after 9-11.
[00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:12.309]  And what amounts to basically a desperate PR stunt to contrive a political turnaround for his ailing aspirations to get a second term in the Oval Office.
[00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:26.873]  Second half of the show will be hosted by Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes and then Alex Jones himself will be calling in from the road to give his take on the unfolding, collapsing, crumbling Bin Laden fable.
[00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:37.887]  And the Bin Laden hoax really is collapsing now, whether you believe he was killed recently or, you know, he was killed nine years ago, as Pchenik has asserted.
[00:02:38.648 --> 00:02:47.796]  The fact is that this whole narrative they've manufactured around the alleged raid and assassination of Bin Laden at his compound there in Pakistan,
[00:02:48.837 --> 00:02:50.938]  It's totally crumbling to the ground.
[00:02:51.138 --> 00:02:57.902]  It's beginning to resemble more and more a Jerry Bruckheimer-style Jessica Lynch fable.
[00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:07.208]  We had the photo of Obama giving the address to the nation on Sunday night, which appeared the next morning in US newspapers.
[00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.849]  Completely staged after the event.
[00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.350]  That has now been admitted.
[00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.391]  That's on the record.
[00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:26.379]  But more importantly, the photos released just a couple of days ago by the White House, the so-called Situation Room photos that people have said depict the, quote, defining moment of Obama's presidency.
[00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:35.745]  And these were the photos that the mainstream media reported illustrated Obama, Hillary Clinton and their White House security team
[00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:48.097]  Grimacing their faces with these stern looks, watching the raid on the Bin Laden compound and watching his assassination unfold live on the big screen in front of them.
[00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:53.563]  And we've got a photo of those pictures that the White House released that we're showing now.
[00:03:54.924 --> 00:04:03.608]  And you had this shot of a shocked Hillary Clinton, a hand anxiously over her mouth as if reacting to, you know, some crucial event.
[00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:14.332]  You had the news telling us that this depicted the moment when, quote, the leader of the free world saw the terror chief shot in the left eye.
[00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:15.913]  That's what they actually told us.
[00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:25.184]  Uh, we were told that this photograph depicted Obama, Clinton and Biden, quote, watching intently as the raid takes place.
[00:04:25.945 --> 00:04:32.233]  And you had the White House counter-terrorist czar, John Brennan, come out and say that, uh, this was evidence of the fact that...
[00:04:32.774 --> 00:04:38.878]  Obama and Clinton were provided with quote, ongoing coverage of the raid as it unfolded.
[00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:47.463]  And so this was told to us as a dramatic part of the Bin Laden narrative and of course it turns out to be a complete hoax, a completely staged fable.
[00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:55.628]  And we'll be back after the break to detail how this whole Bin Laden fraud is collapsing at warp speed.
[00:04:55.668 --> 00:04:57.689]  Stay tuned, it's the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:07.766]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:05:08.046 --> 00:05:10.408]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:05:10.688 --> 00:05:12.930]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.314]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:18.995]  You must act automatically.
[00:05:19.215 --> 00:05:22.399]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:25.202]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:05:25.482 --> 00:05:33.471]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:05:33.852 --> 00:05:36.635]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:46.541]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[00:05:51.104 --> 00:05:51.144]  800-409-5633.
[00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.790]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:08.473]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:11.033]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:06:11.294 --> 00:06:16.495]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:19.456]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:06:19.716 --> 00:06:21.777]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:06:22.037 --> 00:06:27.961]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:31.484]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:06:31.664 --> 00:06:37.188]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:38.749]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:40.250]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.932]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:47.115]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:48.996]  You can find the video at www.
[00:06:50.057 --> 00:06:51.758]  End of America 3.com.
[00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:54.339]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.885]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:11.326]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.107 --> 00:08:13.108]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.649 --> 00:08:17.333]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.853 --> 00:08:21.918]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.088 --> 00:08:27.290]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show this May 5th, 2011.
[00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.631]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:29.991 --> 00:08:37.295]  Paul Craig Roberts coming up at the bottom of the hour and shortly we'll be joined by Rob Jacobson, InfoWars video guru.
[00:08:37.796 --> 00:08:44.099]  Live from Ground Zero, New York as Obama prepares to descend for his staged photo op.
[00:08:44.619 --> 00:08:52.724]  And speaking of photo ops, we had the dramatic release of these Situation Room images by the White House a couple of days ago.
[00:08:53.484 --> 00:09:04.736]  Which the media told us depicted Obama and his staff, including Hillary Clinton, reacting live as the assassination of Bin Laden unfolded on the big screen in front of them.
[00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:14.006]  They said that these Navy SEALs had cameras attached to their helmets and that Obama was able to watch the whole episode go down live.
[00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:37.089]  It actually turns out that there was no moment at all when Obama saw Bin Laden assassinated, supposedly shot in the head, because according to Leon Panetta, the CIA director, the video feed on these cameras was completely cut off before the Navy SEALs even entered the building.
[00:09:37.789 --> 00:09:52.841]  So for all the stern faces and shocked expressions that the media told us were going on in these photos as a result of Clinton and Obama witnessing the raid live, they actually saw nothing whatsoever.
[00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:56.164]  They didn't find out what had happened until it was all over.
[00:09:57.233 --> 00:10:12.540]  And these photos were basically staged in a PR stunt for public consumption, just as the rescue, rescue, in quotations, of Jessica Lynch and the death of Pat Tillman were also manufactured for public consumption.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:29.434]  Fables to generate this contrived jingoism, this phony pro-war sentiment that Obama is now desperately trying to capitalize on in an effort to rebrand himself as this tough, respected leader.
[00:10:30.374 --> 00:10:35.579]  You know, all the Republicans are now clicking their heels because Obama was tough, he got the job done.
[00:10:37.628 --> 00:10:43.693]  He got the job done in basically lying to the American people in front of tens of millions of viewers.
[00:10:43.973 --> 00:10:52.721]  On Sunday night, Obama said that the assassination of Bin Laden followed a, quote, 40-minute shootout.
[00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:59.887]  Now, bear in mind, Obama never saw this took place because the live feed from the cameras had been cut.
[00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:04.967]  And now after the fact it's been admitted that there was no shootout.
[00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:10.471]  There was one individual in the whole compound that was armed and he wasn't even in the house.
[00:11:10.511 --> 00:11:12.033]  He was at a house across the street.
[00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:19.158]  We had these lurid tales about Bin Laden throwing his wife in front of himself as a human shield.
[00:11:19.579 --> 00:11:20.699]  Complete fallacy.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.881]  Made up, contrived.
[00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:23.382]  We had
[00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:29.101]  The tales of Bin Laden resisting, defending himself, firing back.
[00:11:29.561 --> 00:11:31.625]  Again, completely made up, contrived.
[00:11:31.745 --> 00:11:32.546]  He wasn't armed.
[00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.653]  And you would think, you know, with all this
[00:11:38.792 --> 00:11:44.198]  Gracious applauding of torture, how it supposedly led them to find Bin Laden.
[00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.281]  That turns out to be completely untrue as well.
[00:11:48.263 --> 00:11:53.749]  They would have wanted to keep alive the number one intelligence asset in the world, Osama Bin Laden.
[00:11:53.809 --> 00:11:54.590]  He wasn't armed.
[00:11:55.171 --> 00:11:57.734]  At first, they allegedly took him alive.
[00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:00.358]  But then they put a bullet through his head.
[00:12:00.739 --> 00:12:09.325]  Now, if you think that torture is so good at eliciting vital information, would you want to keep Osama Bin Laden alive or would you want to get rid of him straight away?
[00:12:11.867 --> 00:12:13.309]  So basically Obama lied.
[00:12:13.329 --> 00:12:15.210]  He said there was a 40-minute shootout.
[00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:21.295]  He went on national television in his public address on Sunday night and he completely lied.
[00:12:21.315 --> 00:12:23.417]  A totally impeachable offence.
[00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:27.290]  Because it was basically a slaughter in cold blood.
[00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:28.491]  There was no firefight.
[00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:35.876]  There was no live feed to Obama and Clinton, as these staged photos suggested there was.
[00:12:36.096 --> 00:12:43.000]  As the media told us that Obama saw the moment when Bin Laden was shot in his head above the left eye.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.102]  Completely made up, contrived fable.
[00:12:46.762 --> 00:12:48.763]  Obama, Clinton saw none of it.
[00:12:49.244 --> 00:12:52.406]  But they put out these staged photos of them looking shocked.
[00:12:53.459 --> 00:13:04.964]  As the event unfolded, supposedly live, and of course Hillary Clinton has come out today after it all was revealed and said, oh I just had allergies, I just had my hand over my mouth.
[00:13:05.824 --> 00:13:14.408]  And this is already after they've claimed that it was the moments when the raid was happening, even though they didn't see it happen, which is now being admitted.
[00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:19.670]  So, lie upon lie, and nothing about the fairy tale adds up.
[00:13:20.632 --> 00:13:24.855]  And even some quarters of the mainstream media are now having to admit that fact.
[00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:34.122]  The White House Press Secretary, Carney, is being lambasted, left, right and centre, as a failure, as a flounderer.
[00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:39.626]  Because he keeps tripping over his own words, his own lies, during the press briefings.
[00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:44.529]  Because they're having trouble keeping this whole narrative in order.
[00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.273]  You know, tell the truth and you never have to remember anything.
[00:13:50.253 --> 00:13:59.567]  But this Carney guy is so overwhelmed by the fact that the White House keeps flip-flopping and changing the narrative that even he can't keep up.
[00:14:01.803 --> 00:14:19.993]  But don't worry about all that, because according to Time Magazine and the majority of the establishment media, anyone who points out these blaring discrepancies, these inconsistencies with the official narrative, is merely a conspiracy theorist engaging in, quote, black helicopter fantasies.
[00:14:20.213 --> 00:14:27.997]  That's what the Time Magazine writer said yesterday about Alex Jones and all the information that we've presented this week.
[00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:38.350]  So, presumably, that would include the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, who has come out herself and questioned these discrepancies.
[00:14:39.891 --> 00:14:54.759]  Presumably, that would include the man who all this week on the Alex Jones Show, and the man who's coming up as a guest in the next hour, Steve Pchenik, who has blown the lid off the entire Bin Laden fraud, the fact that he died in 2001.
[00:14:57.122 --> 00:15:00.864]  Is he another black helicopter fantasist, Time Magazine?
[00:15:01.404 --> 00:15:05.226]  He served under five US presidents, top spy master.
[00:15:05.666 --> 00:15:11.268]  He wrote the book for the State Department on psychological warfare and counter-terrorism.
[00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:15.770]  He's publicly saying that Bin Laden died in 2001.
[00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:24.294]  Two days ago on the Alex Jones Show, he said that these Situation Room photos were completely staged, a fairy tale.
[00:15:25.054 --> 00:15:27.237]  He's proven completely right again.
[00:15:27.277 --> 00:15:28.339]  He's vindicated.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.585]  Is he a conspiracy theorist, a black helicopter fantasist?
[00:15:32.946 --> 00:15:36.351]  Time, Magazine and the rest of the establishment media.
[00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:40.337]  You know, they've also created this, uh...
[00:15:41.704 --> 00:16:00.230]  This framing of the debate where anyone who questions the official narrative, which is collapsing left, right and centre because they can't keep it straight, is either a wacko, paranoid nutjob or is some Taliban goat herder that claims Bin Laden's still alive.
[00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:10.959]  So, they're framing the debate around that, and then whenever you ask any questions about the whole narrative, even as it collapses, then you're ring-fenced under that label.
[00:16:11.299 --> 00:16:12.720]  It's psychological warfare.
[00:16:13.461 --> 00:16:19.786]  But the whole stack of cards surrounding this Bin Laden fable is collapsing at warp speed, and
[00:16:20.527 --> 00:16:30.907]  Obama's nine point bounce that he's enjoyed so far is already starting to evaporate which is why today he's heading down to ground zero to try and reinvigorate
[00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:35.012]  This whole jingoistic attitude from the American people.
[00:16:35.813 --> 00:16:47.138]  And it's so transparent that they're exploiting this monumental fraud to try and manufacture this post 9-11 kind of intellectual castration of the American people.
[00:16:48.179 --> 00:16:56.803]  Because Obama comes out Sunday night and says that killing Bin Laden means America is now safer, that the world is safer from terrorists.
[00:16:57.643 --> 00:16:58.584]  And yet what happens?
[00:16:58.844 --> 00:17:19.265]  Almost instantly, they start fear-mongering about nuclear holocausts from the admissions of the tortured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who's been waterboarded for the last five years, who will admit to being, you know, the Grinch who stole Christmas, the Tooth Fairy and whatever else after they've tortured him for that amount of time.
[00:17:20.478 --> 00:17:24.240]  And now they're talking about raising the terror threat to a new level, to a higher level.
[00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:31.205]  You've got calls for the TSA to be put in shopping malls, putting their hands down your kids' pants.
[00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:38.149]  You've got more grope downs, you've got more bag searches, and you've got more goons walking around with machine guns.
[00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:46.855]  But Obama told us that the world was safer after the death of Osama bin Laden, and yet their reaction suggests that
[00:17:48.482 --> 00:17:55.425]  It's only going to become more unsafe because, of course, they're the real terrorists launching this psychological warfare operation against us.
[00:17:56.845 --> 00:18:04.108]  But it's all because the terrorists hate our freedom, which is why that local TSA child molester needs to get his hands on your children.
[00:18:04.948 --> 00:18:10.270]  CBS News reporting yesterday calls for TSA in shopping malls.
[00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:14.772]  And you can tell that it's contrived by their own reaction.
[00:18:16.379 --> 00:18:23.523]  It's a weird serial killer kind of reaction where they're going back to the scene of the crime and they're trying to exploit it for all it's worth.
[00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:33.388]  Because now with completely unrelated matters, they're hastily trying to spend Obama's political capital to destroy more of our freedoms.
[00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:40.952]  Bill Richardson comes out and says that killing Bin Laden means that Obama can now push through the cap and tax system.
[00:18:42.913 --> 00:18:43.954]  Try and work that one out.
[00:18:45.148 --> 00:18:55.957]  We've got a new story today out the hill with Obama pushing ahead with a plan to put satellite tracker boxes in your cars to track you by the mile.
[00:18:56.097 --> 00:18:56.798]  Mandatory.
[00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:09.769]  Again, nothing to do with Bin Laden, but it's about Obama spending this political capital, this contrived political capital, on a whole raft of different agendas that he's been waiting to push through.
[00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:31.122]  And if you think that a government that staged an event that started the Vietnam War, the Gulf of Tonkin, complete fabrication, never happened, historical fact, if you think that they're not capable of staging a raid on a building in Pakistan, then you've got another thing coming.
[00:19:32.947 --> 00:19:43.096]  And the whole thing overriding it, which we'll talk about with Steve Pchenik, is the fact that according to every intelligence professional worth their salt, Bin Laden's been dead since 2001.
[00:19:44.398 --> 00:19:49.202]  The fable, the fairytale nature of this fraud knows no bounds.
[00:19:49.302 --> 00:19:53.546]  We'll be back after the break with Rob Jacobson, live from Ground Zero.
[00:19:54.147 --> 00:19:55.968]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[00:19:55.988 --> 00:19:56.589]  Stay tuned.
[00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:10.133]  Economists, politicians, and even the average citizen can agree we may only be days or weeks away from the next terrible event that could literally change the face of life as we know it.

[00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:01.925]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:17.691]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[00:21:17.751 --> 00:21:18.051]  dollar.
[00:21:18.091 --> 00:21:24.874]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide a free weekly newsletter
[00:21:24.994 --> 00:21:25.254]  We're good.
[00:21:45.492 --> 00:21:54.662]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.

[00:22:00.509 --> 00:22:06.774]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[00:22:07.415 --> 00:22:12.979]  18 years ago, we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.123]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[00:22:17.463 --> 00:22:18.944]  My wages were being garnished.
[00:22:19.264 --> 00:22:23.765]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[00:22:24.065 --> 00:22:27.847]  With Zero Debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[00:22:27.907 --> 00:22:29.807]  There is no other program of its kind.

[00:23:29.611 --> 00:23:38.877]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:39.658]  This capitalism?
[00:23:39.738 --> 00:23:45.862]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:23:46.002 --> 00:23:46.823]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:23:46.863 --> 00:23:49.965]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:23:50.125 --> 00:23:50.925]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.

[00:24:00.973 --> 00:24:05.097]  We're good to go.
[00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:33.676]  We're live on the Alex Jones Show, May the 5th, 2011, and we've got Rob Jacobson, InfoWars video guru.
[00:24:34.196 --> 00:24:48.187]  Live on the line from Ground Zero as Barack Obama prepares to descend on the scene for his staged photo-op, trying to get as much political capital out of this Bin Laden fraud as politically possible.
[00:24:49.348 --> 00:24:56.734]  Rob, we've been bombarded with this fear-mongering about these imminent terror attacks and these calls to put the TSA in shopping malls.
[00:24:57.815 --> 00:25:02.279]  How has that hype manifested itself in New York as a police state being on
[00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:13.227]  Well, Paul, I'm over here at Ground Zero and it's the usual display of plenty of police.
[00:25:14.188 --> 00:25:17.650]  It's the first time I've seen police dogs on the street here in Manhattan.
[00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:30.440]  And there are police dogs guarding subway stations, but it's the usual group of police mixed with Secret Service types floating up and down the street.
[00:25:31.427 --> 00:25:37.652]  And, uh, the usual high level of security around Ground Zero, uh, eminent to one of these events.
[00:25:38.392 --> 00:25:46.478]  I got a, uh, group of police officers just, uh, marching right in front of me in some kind of two-by-two formation.
[00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:52.422]  And, um, it's basically, uh, exactly what, uh, you just described.
[00:25:52.623 --> 00:25:59.788]  Uh, everybody seems to be, it doesn't seem that the sentiment is that people are both not as much excited, but also
[00:26:00.652 --> 00:26:07.036]  I'm scared of what may be next and it's a heightened sense of paranoia here in New York City.
[00:26:08.317 --> 00:26:11.919]  So I'm wondering what kind of crowd is down there at the moment?
[00:26:11.939 --> 00:26:20.244]  We saw the celebrations on the White House lawn by these college zombies in the aftermath of this Bin Laden announcement.
[00:26:21.645 --> 00:26:27.709]  Is it a more quiet affair or are there political banners or any signs of that nature?
[00:26:29.116 --> 00:26:36.742]  I'm seeing a few political banners, but no hysteria like we've seen on the evening that Obama made the announcement.
[00:26:37.282 --> 00:26:39.584]  It's mostly people waiting to see the president.
[00:26:41.205 --> 00:26:44.207]  Usual crowd held back by the police line.
[00:26:44.647 --> 00:26:56.516]  I did see one sign basically saying that some woman's children are proud to be raised in a country where they love their president.
[00:26:59.227 --> 00:27:00.088]  That kind of thing.
[00:27:00.128 --> 00:27:01.669]  But not too many political signs.
[00:27:01.729 --> 00:27:03.610]  A couple of American flags.
[00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:07.053]  Not like we've seen on the evening of the announcement.
[00:27:09.014 --> 00:27:11.836]  Yeah, love of president as opposed to love of country.
[00:27:11.876 --> 00:27:13.157]  They think that's patriotism.
[00:27:13.857 --> 00:27:16.559]  I was hearing you were kicked out of the press area.
[00:27:16.939 --> 00:27:17.560]  Is that true?
[00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:19.221]  That's true.
[00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:20.682]  I was in the press area.
[00:27:21.342 --> 00:27:24.405]  I was waiting on line to actually go into the pit itself.
[00:27:25.265 --> 00:27:27.787]  They told me since we didn't contact the White House,
[00:27:28.348 --> 00:27:35.491]  Days and days before, I am not qualified to cover the president or take pictures of him in any way.
[00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:49.697]  I explained to him I'm here with a nationally syndicated radio show and I was prepared to have our producer get on the line with whoever needed to speak with him to prove that, you know, we truly are press.
[00:27:49.737 --> 00:27:57.220]  We are probably larger than most of the national labels I've seen.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:58.860]  We're good to go.
[00:28:19.175 --> 00:28:25.761]  Well, obviously, I mean, Obama can't give a town hall speech without every single guest going through this approval process.
[00:28:26.202 --> 00:28:29.845]  And it's like the media equivalent of the free speech zones.
[00:28:29.865 --> 00:28:38.514]  You have to ask the government permission to engage in your First Amendment right, not only to protest, but merely to cover a public
[00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:43.197]  Media event is ridiculous and it's a sign of what's happened after 9-11.
[00:28:43.577 --> 00:28:51.763]  Of course the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom and then governments, consecutive governments, proceeded to take those freedoms away.
[00:28:53.284 --> 00:28:59.248]  I'm wondering, you've obviously traveled to New York on numerous occasions over the past few years.
[00:29:00.028 --> 00:29:08.494]  As somebody who visits often, what kind of statement does it make that 10 years nearly after 9-11, Ground Zero is still virtually a building site?
[00:29:10.803 --> 00:29:23.390]  Um, it shows that, um, you know, the statement is, is that either, everybody seems, the sentiment around the people is that everybody's a little disappointed that nothing is going on.
[00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.071]  I see a couple of construction sites here.
[00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:28.512]  The Liberty Tower is about 63 stories.
[00:29:28.652 --> 00:29:31.754]  There's another building going up, still under construction.
[00:29:31.774 --> 00:29:36.236]  This is all going on about 10 years after the actual incident.
[00:29:36.276 --> 00:29:37.997]  You'd think this would have been going on
[00:29:38.547 --> 00:29:44.731]  You know, a couple of years after, after some planning and whatnot, but... Okay, thanks, Rob.
[00:29:44.751 --> 00:29:45.932]  We're heading to the break now.
[00:29:46.252 --> 00:29:46.993]  Stay safe.
[00:29:47.313 --> 00:29:49.254]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones Show live.
[00:29:49.514 --> 00:29:50.135]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:50.195 --> 00:29:51.235]  Paul Craig Roberts coming up.
[00:29:51.255 --> 00:29:51.996]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.496 --> 00:29:54.117]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.038 --> 00:29:57.700]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.122 --> 00:30:05.726]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:06.146 --> 00:30:09.150]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:14.155]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:30:14.175 --> 00:30:20.422]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.582 --> 00:30:22.825]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.345 --> 00:30:24.506]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:30:24.526 --> 00:30:25.586]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.927 --> 00:30:28.348]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:42.256 --> 00:30:46.159]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:49.161]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.521 --> 00:30:58.648]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.711 --> 00:31:04.954]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:05.534]  Number 1.
[00:31:06.174 --> 00:31:09.336]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:31:09.597 --> 00:31:10.157]  Number 2.
[00:31:10.457 --> 00:31:15.020]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:15.801]  It's true.
[00:31:16.101 --> 00:31:20.644]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:31:20.964 --> 00:31:21.504]  Number 3.
[00:31:21.804 --> 00:31:25.086]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:31:25.387 --> 00:31:29.069]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:31:29.289 --> 00:31:29.830]  Number 4.
[00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.433]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:36.217]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:31:36.517 --> 00:31:36.737]  Number 5.
[00:31:37.318 --> 00:31:41.242]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:31:41.463 --> 00:31:46.228]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:56.999 --> 00:31:57.679]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:31:57.699 --> 00:32:01.723]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.971]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:16.432]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.612 --> 00:32:19.393]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.653 --> 00:32:21.774]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.974 --> 00:32:27.895]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:31.416]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.596 --> 00:32:37.098]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.378 --> 00:32:38.699]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.221]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:40.321 --> 00:32:42.863]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.983 --> 00:32:47.047]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[00:33:03.459 --> 00:33:04.180]  In constant sorrow
[00:33:28.977 --> 00:33:32.398]  We're back live, it's the Alex Jones Show, May 5th, 2011.
[00:33:33.158 --> 00:33:43.202]  Coming up at the top of the hour, Steve R. Pchenik, top spy masterworks under five different US presidents to talk about the Bin Laden fable.
[00:33:43.642 --> 00:33:48.164]  Now we have President Barack Obama mimicking George W. Bush.
[00:33:49.064 --> 00:34:11.041]  He's descended on ground zero and Obama, according to the Associated Press, is now basically repeating exact similar phrases that George Bush used as he stood on the rubble in those days after 9-11 as Obama desperately attempts to seize on the political capital that this Bin Laden raid has afforded him.
[00:34:11.702 --> 00:34:12.723]  But I'm delighted to say
[00:34:13.403 --> 00:34:35.052]  We've been joined by Paul Craig Roberts, who many of you will know of course was the father of Reaganomics, served as Assistant Treasury Secretary under Ronald Reagan, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, and of course Mr. Roberts is a prolific author and writer whose articles we eagerly await.
[00:34:35.072 --> 00:34:39.814]  We've posted his latest article on PrisonPlanet.com this morning.
[00:34:40.214 --> 00:34:42.415]  Mr. Roberts, great to have you on the show today.
[00:34:43.496 --> 00:34:44.096]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:34:45.277 --> 00:34:46.178]  Good to speak to you.
[00:34:46.458 --> 00:34:52.021]  Before you get started with me, I was fascinated by the piece yesterday.
[00:34:53.362 --> 00:34:56.423]  Your report, I think it was, on Steve Pichenik.
[00:34:57.424 --> 00:34:58.544]  Did I pronounce that right?
[00:34:59.345 --> 00:35:00.366]  Steve Pichenik, yeah.
[00:35:00.686 --> 00:35:01.726]  Yeah.
[00:35:02.807 --> 00:35:04.848]  I thought this was amazing.
[00:35:04.908 --> 00:35:09.971]  Not so much the Bin Laden part, because I think that's been known for some time, but
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:28.404]  His statement that he had been told by a general from, I think, Wolfowitz staff that 9-11 was an inside job and that he was willing himself, Steve Pagenik, to testify on the oath before Congress and reveal the guy's name.
[00:35:28.444 --> 00:35:30.924]  Now this is an astonishing development.
[00:35:32.445 --> 00:35:33.865]  This is for real, I take it.
[00:35:33.905 --> 00:35:37.586]  I take it you've got this on tape or video or something.
[00:35:38.644 --> 00:35:44.929]  It was said live during Mr. Pchenik's interview with Alex Jones on Tuesday, and that's right.
[00:35:45.129 --> 00:35:50.414]  And it's an astounding admission which has been completely ignored by the mainstream media.
[00:35:50.674 --> 00:35:52.656]  They dare not even try and debunk it.
[00:35:53.776 --> 00:35:59.841]  You know, I'm not... His credentials are substantial.
[00:36:00.882 --> 00:36:05.606]  But what puzzles me about it is, I mean, that kind of marks him for a dead man, doesn't it?
[00:36:07.203 --> 00:36:09.084]  They're either going to ignore him or they're going to kill him.
[00:36:09.144 --> 00:36:20.847]  I mean, as well-connected as he's been in government, it seems to me he would know that if he says something like that, he's going to have an accident before anybody takes him up on the offer.
[00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:27.289]  I mean, that strikes me as reckless, almost.
[00:36:28.549 --> 00:36:33.170]  I've been really puzzled about why he would say that.
[00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.871]  I mean, I can understand revealing it.
[00:36:36.603 --> 00:36:42.774]  Uh, but not, you know, not forecasting that he was gonna reveal it.
[00:36:42.794 --> 00:36:45.698]  That's one thing they won't let be revealed.
[00:36:45.738 --> 00:36:47.081]  They're not gonna let that happen.
[00:36:47.998 --> 00:36:50.059]  Exactly, I mean Alex asked him about that.
[00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:56.724]  Alex was trying to get him on air to say, you know, I'm not suicidal like the DC madam and obviously we know what happened to her.
[00:36:57.484 --> 00:37:05.189]  But Pchenik basically said, you know, I'm a professional, I've got dirt on them and he was basically not afraid of that.
[00:37:05.529 --> 00:37:14.095]  But he's actually coming up as a guest at the top of the hour and that's something I can press him further on in the next hour of the show.
[00:37:15.235 --> 00:37:15.916]  My question...
[00:37:16.576 --> 00:37:24.922]  My question for you, Mr Roberts, is you wrote on Monday that the whole Bin Laden thing had, quote, the odour of a staged event.
[00:37:25.423 --> 00:37:39.033]  Now you've been justified in that assessment with these Situation Room photos that the media told us were an account of Obama and Hillary Clinton watching the live assassination of Bin Laden unfold.
[00:37:39.373 --> 00:37:42.455]  That has now been documented to be completely fraudulent.
[00:37:42.495 --> 00:37:44.237]  The live video stream was cut off.
[00:37:44.317 --> 00:37:45.758]  They saw nothing of the raid.
[00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:50.341]  You've wrote this other article today which is excellent.
[00:37:51.042 --> 00:37:58.527]  What do you think are the most alarming discrepancies in this whole Bin Laden narrative that we've been sold on by the White House and the media?
[00:38:00.308 --> 00:38:12.337]  Well, you know, Paul, the thing was never believable in the beginning because the original story of a firefight
[00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:26.655]  With the heroic SEALs taking on Al-Qaeda, which Rumsfeld described as the most highly trained, the most dangerous, most vicious killers on the planet.
[00:38:27.916 --> 00:38:34.519]  And so they get, the SEALs get into a firefight with these vicious, highly trained killers and they don't get a scratch.
[00:38:35.759 --> 00:38:38.641]  So that already tells you something stinks.
[00:38:39.441 --> 00:38:41.903]  Because you, anybody can hear a helicopter coming.
[00:38:42.623 --> 00:38:44.684]  You know, even, even people who are asleep.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:54.703]  So, then, before 48 hours passed, the whole story changes fundamentally.
[00:38:55.844 --> 00:38:56.904]  There's no firefight.
[00:38:58.244 --> 00:39:01.466]  Bin Laden's not a coward after all, hiding behind a woman.
[00:39:01.486 --> 00:39:05.847]  He's not even armed, says the White House press spokesman.
[00:39:06.467 --> 00:39:08.068]  The direct quote, he wasn't armed.
[00:39:09.412 --> 00:39:15.537]  And so, all of a sudden, we go from heroes in a firefight to cold-blooded murderers.
[00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:26.145]  And even worse, even if you believe the government story, you have to see it as the most botched operation in history.
[00:39:26.185 --> 00:39:37.073]  So why in the world would you kill the mastermind who has all the secrets of terrorism when he's unarmed, harmless, and surrounded?
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.861]  That's the last thing you would do is to kill him.
[00:39:42.322 --> 00:39:49.504]  And so that part of the story is not so much a discrepancy that's important.
[00:39:49.684 --> 00:39:52.265]  It's the story itself.
[00:39:52.465 --> 00:39:53.526]  It makes no sense.
[00:39:55.326 --> 00:39:59.668]  And the reason they had to say that is they didn't capture him.
[00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:00.528]  They didn't kill him.
[00:40:00.568 --> 00:40:01.369]  He wasn't there.
[00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:02.529]  He was already dead.
[00:40:02.549 --> 00:40:07.531]  This is a staged event for a bunch of hidden agendas, not merely
[00:40:08.041 --> 00:40:14.904]  For Obama's popularity and poll ratings and re-election campaign, that's no doubt part of it.
[00:40:14.944 --> 00:40:18.585]  But there are other agendas that this event is being used for.
[00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:22.046]  For example, the justification of torture is one.
[00:40:24.099 --> 00:40:27.982]  Probably starting more trouble with Pakistan is another.
[00:40:28.342 --> 00:40:31.365]  More powers for homeland security is another.
[00:40:31.905 --> 00:40:40.912]  Probably more false flag attacks that they will say is due to al-Qaeda retaliation for killing bin Laden.
[00:40:40.932 --> 00:40:45.696]  There are all kinds of agendas that are hiding behind this false story.
[00:40:48.018 --> 00:40:52.261]  So, the dead giveaway is that
[00:40:53.317 --> 00:41:00.924]  If you actually did catch this guy, you wouldn't quickly throw the evidence of your success into the ocean.
[00:41:03.126 --> 00:41:11.113]  The minute you do that, the whole story becomes suspect, because there's no real explanation for why they dumped the body in the ocean.
[00:41:12.014 --> 00:41:16.819]  The story they give is obviously a fabrication, and it's incorrect.
[00:41:17.922 --> 00:41:22.524]  Uh, that they were giving him a quick burial in keeping with Muslim practices.
[00:41:22.564 --> 00:41:25.826]  This has been challenged by the Muslim demons.
[00:41:25.906 --> 00:41:37.471]  They say that you're supposed to be buried in the ground with your head pointed toward Mecca, and that the only excuse for dumping somebody at sea is if it's a very long voyage and the body is decomposing.
[00:41:38.792 --> 00:41:42.794]  And so every aspect of the story is phony.
[00:41:42.814 --> 00:41:45.095]  There's nothing true about any of it.
[00:41:47.722 --> 00:41:50.804]  Other great puzzle, Paul, is why did they change the story?
[00:41:52.525 --> 00:41:56.588]  If you're going to pull off something like this, you've got to know what the story is and stick with it.
[00:41:57.949 --> 00:42:02.733]  And yet, before 48 hours passes, the whole story has changed fundamentally.
[00:42:03.893 --> 00:42:04.214]  Why?
[00:42:04.374 --> 00:42:06.435]  What was the pressure to change the story?
[00:42:08.757 --> 00:42:11.359]  They didn't have to worry about Pakistan ratting on them.
[00:42:11.419 --> 00:42:17.403]  Pakistan is enough of an American puppet that if it was ordered
[00:42:18.281 --> 00:42:18.661]  Shut up?
[00:42:18.722 --> 00:42:19.282]  It would shut up.
[00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:28.227]  I mean, Pakistan lets the United States conduct illegal military actions on its territory, killing its citizens.
[00:42:29.208 --> 00:42:38.873]  Pakistan lets the United States Army send the Pakistani Army into tribal areas, into entire provinces, displacing entire populations of people.
[00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:47.258]  If Washington tells Pakistan, hey, we're going to stage this thing and we want your help and you better not say anything about it, they're going to cooperate.
[00:42:48.647 --> 00:42:52.271]  So, the real question is, why did the story change?
[00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:55.874]  What's going on?
[00:42:58.257 --> 00:43:12.291]  Are people in the government now, I'm just speculating, I don't have any idea, are people in the government now seeing they don't want Obama, some of them don't want Obama again, and they see that he's managed to do this to boost his
[00:43:12.884 --> 00:43:20.626]  Poll ratings by 24% and so now they're going to undermine it because they want to get rid of him or they rather have a different puppet or something.
[00:43:20.646 --> 00:43:32.150]  There's all kinds of things going on that we don't know about and that might explain why the administration, the government, is destroying its own story.
[00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.511]  It's not being destroyed by news people.
[00:43:36.831 --> 00:43:42.653]  The news people are still celebrating the victory over bin Laden.
[00:43:43.736 --> 00:43:52.061]  And the news people have given the imprimatur to extra-legal murder of unarmed people.
[00:43:53.601 --> 00:44:00.605]  So it's not the news media who's exposed, it's the government itself that keeps changing the story.
[00:44:00.645 --> 00:44:03.827]  And where's the pressure coming from to change the story?
[00:44:03.847 --> 00:44:10.911]  I mean, why create such massive credibility problems
[00:44:12.065 --> 00:44:13.406]  Well, the government's own story.
[00:44:14.447 --> 00:44:22.692]  So maybe all the people inside the government are fighting each other over who they want to run the next time.
[00:44:22.812 --> 00:44:26.115]  I don't know what's going on, but that's the biggest puzzle to me.
[00:44:26.815 --> 00:44:34.760]  Maybe somebody on your desk, maybe Steve today, can throw some light on that.
[00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:36.502]  That is the most interesting question.
[00:44:36.582 --> 00:44:41.305]  So the two real questions, and then I'll be finished here.
[00:44:42.188 --> 00:44:49.473]  One is, what are the real agendas that this news event is designed to further?
[00:44:50.614 --> 00:45:06.424]  And two, why did the government wreck its own story by changing it before 48 hours are over, without any obvious sources of pressure on them to change the story?
[00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:09.940]  It's amazing, I mean.
[00:45:24.026 --> 00:45:24.627]  Well, exactly.
[00:45:24.647 --> 00:45:37.279]  I mean, you've got the press secretary, Carney, who's now being lambasted by all sides of the media as this flounderer, this failure, because he's having difficulty getting the fable straight.
[00:45:37.319 --> 00:45:38.841]  He keeps tripping over his words.
[00:45:38.881 --> 00:45:41.443]  He keeps giving contradictory explanations.
[00:45:41.844 --> 00:45:43.425]  And like you said, it's baffling.
[00:45:43.465 --> 00:45:47.009]  It's almost as if it's deliberately designed to look hokey.
[00:45:48.409 --> 00:45:51.430]  I mean, you've got neighbours surrounding this so-called compound.
[00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.350]  They say they'd never saw Bin Laden.
[00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.211]  It's a stone's throw away from a Pakistani military base.
[00:45:57.711 --> 00:46:00.252]  All the residents have to have ID cards.
[00:46:00.292 --> 00:46:02.452]  They have to go through checkpoints to get anywhere.
[00:46:03.313 --> 00:46:07.274]  And the only photos that have been released are of these victims.
[00:46:07.294 --> 00:46:09.094]  Of course, none of them have been Laden.
[00:46:09.854 --> 00:46:12.975]  It's increasingly starting to look like he wasn't... I mean...
[00:46:13.795 --> 00:46:18.176]  We know that every intelligence professional worth their salt said that he's been dead for nine years.
[00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:27.598]  It's starting to look as if perhaps some members of the Bin Laden family were there and that's what they used as the reason to go in.
[00:46:28.138 --> 00:46:41.321]  But I mean, it's like in your article today, you quote this email that you received from a reader who asks, you know, why the government's so sloppy in its lies that it virtually makes no effort to make them appear credible.
[00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:41.841]  I mean,
[00:46:42.381 --> 00:46:47.382]  Why are they so arrogant in their total disregard for the intellect of the American people?
[00:46:48.042 --> 00:46:50.863]  I think the answer to that, Paul, is they got away with 9-11.
[00:46:51.243 --> 00:46:57.185]  They blew up two skyscrapers in plain view of everybody, in plain view of their TV cameras.
[00:46:57.205 --> 00:47:01.686]  We've got recordings all over the world of these buildings being blown up.
[00:47:01.766 --> 00:47:04.687]  Anybody that looks at those buildings can see they're being blown up.
[00:47:04.707 --> 00:47:05.707]  They're not falling down.
[00:47:06.516 --> 00:47:10.978]  These are not buildings falling down from structural damage from an airliner or fire.
[00:47:11.358 --> 00:47:12.698]  These buildings are blowing up.
[00:47:12.718 --> 00:47:13.799]  You can see they're blowing up.
[00:47:14.399 --> 00:47:34.066]  If they get away with that, if they can get away with the fable that a few Saudis with box cutters can outwit all 16 American intelligence agencies, all the intelligence agencies of NATO, of Israel even, can outwit NORAD, air traffic control, airport security four times in one morning,
[00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:39.284]  Can cause the state-of-the-art Pentagon air defenses to fail.
[00:47:39.425 --> 00:47:42.026]  Anybody can pull off this superhero stuff.
[00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:43.368]  How could anybody believe that?
[00:47:44.588 --> 00:47:44.989]  You can't.
[00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:48.211]  I mean, did you see the film V for Vendetta?
[00:47:48.912 --> 00:47:51.454]  Where the superhero blows up the British Parliament?
[00:47:51.814 --> 00:47:56.377]  Well, hell, the 9-11 attack makes that look like nothing.
[00:47:57.638 --> 00:47:59.440]  And yet people fall for these things.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:03.523]  I mean, so I guess that's the reason the government
[00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:09.526]  It just shows it doesn't make any effort to even make a credible lie.
[00:48:09.566 --> 00:48:16.111]  It just knows that it can use the Patriot card and 80% of the people will fall for it.
[00:48:16.432 --> 00:48:17.512]  The patriotism will.
[00:48:18.113 --> 00:48:19.754]  And they'll be, oh, we got him.
[00:48:19.794 --> 00:48:20.875]  We got the towelhead.
[00:48:21.015 --> 00:48:23.938]  So that's what they rely on, I think.
[00:48:23.978 --> 00:48:26.920]  They don't think anybody is going to think about it.
[00:48:27.721 --> 00:48:28.962]  People are just going to celebrate.
[00:48:32.234 --> 00:48:38.840]  If you start thinking about it, you have to give up celebrating, and they'd rather celebrate than be suspicious of their government.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.282]  That's probably the answer.
[00:48:41.342 --> 00:48:48.107]  I thought that reader that you quoted made a very good point, raised the central question.
[00:48:48.147 --> 00:48:50.349]  That's why I put it in my article today.
[00:48:50.389 --> 00:48:53.512]  But I think that's the answer, Paul.
[00:48:54.312 --> 00:48:58.696]  They know, look, they've always got away with everything.
[00:48:59.036 --> 00:48:59.897]  Remember the Maine.
[00:49:01.136 --> 00:49:02.177]  The Gulf of Tonkin.
[00:49:03.958 --> 00:49:05.420]  Weapons of mass destruction.
[00:49:07.221 --> 00:49:09.503]  Governments all over the world have got away with these things.
[00:49:09.523 --> 00:49:13.486]  You know, Hitler got away with the Reichstag fire.
[00:49:13.626 --> 00:49:17.268]  They blamed it on the left wing or some deranged commie.
[00:49:18.449 --> 00:49:21.812]  These things are commonplace in history and they always were.
[00:49:22.773 --> 00:49:26.956]  In fact, I wonder if there are any examples that didn't work.
[00:49:29.325 --> 00:49:32.025]  I can't think of any offhand, maybe there are some somewhere.
[00:49:34.741 --> 00:49:36.942]  Well, it's with everything, like you said.
[00:49:37.102 --> 00:49:40.404]  I mean, Operation Gladio, they got away with that as well.
[00:49:41.084 --> 00:49:57.552]  And I think it comes down to the fact that when people don't have time or don't have the effort to scratch the surface on these things, they just throw in their lot with the US government as if it's some kind of baseball team, like they scored a major victory.
[00:49:57.932 --> 00:50:02.815]  I mean, in the aftermath of the bombardment of Iraq, pizza and
[00:50:03.575 --> 00:50:04.295]  I think that must be it.
[00:50:04.315 --> 00:50:04.475]  And so...
[00:50:32.048 --> 00:50:41.331]  But still, we'll remember now, the two questions that we should focus on is, what are the real agendas behind this theatre?
[00:50:42.531 --> 00:50:44.372]  And two, why did the government change the story?
[00:50:45.252 --> 00:50:47.853]  And we'll talk about that after the break with Paul Craig-Roberts.
[00:50:47.893 --> 00:50:48.433]  Stay tuned.
[00:51:00.882 --> 00:51:04.004]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?

[00:53:01.055 --> 00:53:02.275]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:02.535 --> 00:53:03.436]  The real U.S.
[00:53:03.576 --> 00:53:08.677]  unemployment rate is now 22%, and not 9% like what we are told by the mainstream media.
[00:53:08.877 --> 00:53:13.538]  The primary instinct of unemployed Americans is to go to college and seek a higher education.
[00:53:13.678 --> 00:53:19.260]  But all across America, students are graduating with hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and no jobs.
[00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:27.486]  Most college graduates are now admitting that they would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having their lives destroyed by student loans.
[00:53:27.826 --> 00:53:37.653]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association are getting ready to release College Conspiracy, the world's most comprehensive documentary ever produced about America's college education system.
[00:53:37.893 --> 00:53:44.938]  To be among the first to see College Conspiracy, sign up for the free NIA newsletter today at www.inflation.us.
[00:53:45.678 --> 00:53:49.621]  NIA believes that college education is the largest scam in American history.
[00:53:49.841 --> 00:53:54.343]  College Conspiracy will expose the facts and truth about the education system here in the U.S.
[00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:59.367]  Sign up for free today at inflation.us to be among the first to see College Conspiracy.
[00:54:20.538 --> 00:54:20.938]  We're back.
[00:54:21.278 --> 00:54:23.999]  It's the Alex Jones Show live with me, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:24.359 --> 00:54:26.680]  Delighted to be joined by Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:32.401]  We were talking about the agendas behind why they're contriving this Bin Laden fable.
[00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:46.625]  Many have suggested that we had these reports a couple of weeks ago about the Pakistani government protesting about the US drone strike simply because of the fact that they've killed so many innocent people in Pakistan.
[00:54:47.585 --> 00:54:54.927]  We had the Prime Minister of Pakistan Yusuf Ranza Jilani saying, quote, these attacks are creating a lot of problems for us.
[00:54:55.247 --> 00:54:57.548]  The US will have to stop these attacks.
[00:54:57.968 --> 00:55:06.111]  And of course, there were massive protests in Pakistan about these drone strikes just days before this Bin Laden fraud was rolled out.
[00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:11.052]  Pakistan is now being geopolitically isolated.
[00:55:11.092 --> 00:55:14.793]  They're saying that Pakistan was harbouring Bin Laden all along, of course.
[00:55:15.154 --> 00:55:17.614]  That only means that so was the CIA.
[00:55:17.834 --> 00:55:20.635]  It's tied with the Pakistani ISI at the hip.
[00:55:20.915 --> 00:55:26.557]  Those are the two organisations that created Bin Laden as a terrorist leader in the first place.
[00:55:26.997 --> 00:55:31.239]  So a lot of people are suggesting that it's a kind of reprisal against Pakistan.
[00:55:32.219 --> 00:55:38.685]  For their unwillingness to continue going along with this support in the hegemony of the US Empire.
[00:55:40.227 --> 00:55:43.550]  I want to get your comments on that but I also want to turn to Libya.
[00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:54.401]  We had the NATO spokesman James Apathori two days ago say, quote, the UN Security Council should adopt a new resolution on Libya.
[00:55:54.961 --> 00:55:59.142]  Resolution 1973 does not envisage land operations.
[00:55:59.222 --> 00:56:00.743]  We need a new resolution.
[00:56:01.343 --> 00:56:09.125]  So, Dr. Roberts, it seems that NATO and the UN are basically going back on everything they promised when this bombardment started.
[00:56:09.145 --> 00:56:12.406]  They're now talking about ground troops.
[00:56:13.026 --> 00:56:16.727]  How long do you think ground troops... until ground troops are sent in?
[00:56:17.187 --> 00:56:21.748]  And why has Libya been targeted for a regime change amongst all this?
[00:56:23.123 --> 00:56:30.668]  Okay, Paul, first to ask the question about did they concoct the Bin Laden death to shut up Pakistan?
[00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.309]  No.
[00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:40.235]  But no doubt they saw that as also another useful game of it, but they wouldn't have organized it for that purpose.
[00:56:41.056 --> 00:56:48.601]  But when you organize something like this, all sorts of agendas can get hooked onto it.
[00:56:50.603 --> 00:56:55.524]  You can see them sitting around the table and somebody says, well, this will also let us put pressure on Pakistan.
[00:56:55.564 --> 00:56:56.264]  We'll blame them.
[00:56:56.284 --> 00:56:56.825]  Blah, blah.
[00:56:59.725 --> 00:57:09.788]  And often what happens is the people who concocted for the real agenda, perhaps it was Obama wanting to get reelected or boost him.
[00:57:09.808 --> 00:57:12.568]  You see, here's what Obama was faced with.
[00:57:13.389 --> 00:57:14.689]  He was thinking in the polls.
[00:57:16.688 --> 00:57:22.913]  And so the question was whether he would all of a sudden be faced with challenges for the nomination.
[00:57:24.534 --> 00:57:27.016]  See, that's the last thing a sitting president wants.
[00:57:27.476 --> 00:57:32.180]  He wants to be re-nominated without having to go through a primary of his own.
[00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:45.571]  But if he's sinking in the polls at a time that's getting close enough to the presidential campaign itself, then he has to worry about
[00:57:46.528 --> 00:57:48.909]  All the money getting behind another candidate.
[00:57:50.449 --> 00:57:59.292]  So if he can boost his popularity long enough to make it too difficult for a last-minute challenge to come up.
[00:58:01.153 --> 00:58:04.054]  So that's one good reason for Obama to have done this.
[00:58:04.834 --> 00:58:10.456]  And it's probably the lead reason that he did it.
[00:58:11.116 --> 00:58:11.816]  That it was done.
[00:58:12.296 --> 00:58:13.877]  To get rid of any
[00:58:15.046 --> 00:58:17.048]  Okay, we're going to have to leave it there.
[00:58:17.308 --> 00:58:18.429]  We're out of time.
[00:58:18.469 --> 00:58:20.771]  We'll talk about Libya next time.
[00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:23.033]  Thanks Paul, Craig, Robert.
[00:58:23.053 --> 00:58:23.874]  Stay tuned.
[00:58:44.603 --> 00:58:48.365]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.106 --> 00:58:57.769]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:00.411]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:02.912]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoods Direct.
[00:59:03.132 --> 00:59:07.314]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[00:59:07.514 --> 00:59:08.995]  You must act automatically.
[00:59:09.215 --> 00:59:12.399]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[00:59:12.719 --> 00:59:15.202]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[00:59:15.502 --> 00:59:23.471]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[00:59:23.852 --> 00:59:26.635]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[00:59:26.875 --> 00:59:36.545]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[00:59:36.565 --> 00:59:38.727]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[00:59:38.767 --> 00:59:41.150]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[00:59:53.743 --> 00:59:55.664]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.124 --> 00:59:58.966]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:06.190]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:07.891]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.611 --> 01:00:09.852]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.372 --> 01:00:11.193]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.953 --> 01:00:12.874]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.894 --> 01:00:17.116]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.676 --> 01:00:21.759]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.917 --> 01:00:25.878]  Second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.898 --> 01:00:30.819]  We're going a million miles an hour today because we've got so many guests, so many different hosts.
[01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:33.439]  We've got Steve Watson coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.260]  And then we're going to be hosted by Aaron Dykes.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:41.181]  Of course, Alex Jones is going to call in later on with an update.
[01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:42.362]  He's on the road at the moment.
[01:00:44.002 --> 01:00:54.786]  We're joined by Steve R. Pachenik, whose revelations this week have prompted one of the biggest reactions we've ever had from a guest.
[01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:58.548]  The listeners have been completely blown away with what they've heard.
[01:00:59.128 --> 01:01:08.712]  Steve Pachenik, of course, Deputy Assistant Secretary under three different administrations, also worked in the Reagan and Bush senior administrations.
[01:01:09.372 --> 01:01:28.172]  Top spymaster, terrorist hunter for the US government, wrote the book on psychological warfare and counter-terrorism for the State Department, and of course dropped the bombshell this week on the Alex Jones Show that Osama Bin Laden has been dead for the best part of a decade, since late 2001.
[01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:31.316]  Dr. Pichennik, great to have you back on the show today.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:39.965]  Oh, it's always a pleasure, and I want to thank you and Alex Jones for bringing me on, and I want to thank the audience for listening to me.
[01:01:40.006 --> 01:01:47.091]  It's very kind of them, and again, this is something that we go back over a decade.
[01:01:47.231 --> 01:01:55.777]  It's very rare to have a host like Alex Jones, who had the bravery to bring me on ten years ago, right after 9-11, when I pronounced not only was 9-11 a false flag,
[01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:09.976]  And stand-down operation, which most Americans now realize, but at the same time, part of the whole scenario of the PsyOps war that was created by Bush Jr.
[01:02:10.196 --> 01:02:18.241]  and before that Clinton, quite frankly, because he was involved, was the fact that Osama bin Laden had been diagnosed with Marfan syndrome.
[01:02:18.261 --> 01:02:20.143]  Many of your people can look it up.
[01:02:20.223 --> 01:02:23.545]  It's called M-A-R-F-A-N, where the lifespan is very short.
[01:02:24.425 --> 01:02:26.887]  And one of the consequences is arterial
[01:02:27.627 --> 01:02:28.328]  It's a great show.
[01:02:53.224 --> 01:03:07.698]  Uh, the issue of why we used Osama Bin Laden is basically a story narrative that the intelligence community, usually the CIA and civilians, not often the military, although the military is
[01:03:08.428 --> 01:03:10.950]  Literally, uh, separated out at this point.
[01:03:11.131 --> 01:03:25.084]  Many of my own men I work with in special forces, not the Navy, but the army, particularly in the army intelligence, I have really been watching this and, and I must admit that we have, I have full respect for our military.
[01:03:25.144 --> 01:03:29.588]  I myself was a Colonel at 32 and refused promotion at 39.
[01:03:29.668 --> 01:03:34.072]  But my point being that there was a narrative that was developed in order for the United States
[01:03:34.667 --> 01:03:35.007]  I think so.
[01:03:50.675 --> 01:04:17.493]  Osama Bin Laden was supposed to be the bad guy and that's why we went in there and we would pursue him and continue the war in Iraq and Afghanistan for reasons that were unclear to everybody except that we were killing Al-Qaeda members, but it turned out that the Al-Qaeda members we were killing were the people we trained in the beginning when I was involved in the Carter administration under Brzezinski and then followed through in various other administrations that came out, some of them from special forces.
[01:04:18.013 --> 01:04:18.454]  I don't know.
[01:04:36.094 --> 01:04:54.858]  Azalmay Khalilzad, Elliot Abrams, Condoleezza Rice, Richard Cheney, all of the what would eventually be turning criminals and liars as we found out that there was no weapons of mass destruction and suddenly not only did we have one villain, Osama Bin Laden, who had already been dead in this narrative.
[01:04:54.878 --> 01:04:59.879]  We'll talk about it after the break, stay there, we'll be right back with Steve R. Pchenik.
[01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:04.076]  You're subject to other police action.
[01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:05.838]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.198 --> 01:05:09.903]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:09.923 --> 01:05:12.345]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.365 --> 01:05:17.772]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.212 --> 01:05:24.494]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:24.894 --> 01:05:30.436]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:30.877 --> 01:05:34.538]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.

[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.181]  Others don't.
[01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:04.525]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.845 --> 01:07:05.445]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.765 --> 01:07:08.907]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:09.188 --> 01:07:09.728]  Number 2.
[01:07:10.048 --> 01:07:14.591]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:15.372]  It's true.
[01:07:15.672 --> 01:07:20.235]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:20.555 --> 01:07:21.095]  Number 3.
[01:07:21.375 --> 01:07:24.657]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:28.660]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.860 --> 01:07:29.401]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.661 --> 01:07:32.023]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:32.424 --> 01:07:35.787]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:36.108 --> 01:07:36.308]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.888 --> 01:07:40.813]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:41.033 --> 01:07:45.798]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:46.078 --> 01:07:50.101]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:08.375]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.975 --> 01:08:11.958]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:15.981]  We're live.
[01:08:16.021 --> 01:08:17.142]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:17.162 --> 01:08:22.990]  We're talking to Steve R. Pachenik, top spymaster, works under five US administrations.
[01:08:24.472 --> 01:08:31.581]  Dr. Pachenik, I was talking in the last half hour to the former Assistant Treasury Secretary under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:08:32.222 --> 01:08:36.764]  And he was, of course, fascinated by the statement you made earlier this week.
[01:08:37.364 --> 01:08:49.148]  The fact that a top general under Wolfowitz told you directly that 9-11 was a false flag and that you were prepared to go in front of a federal committee to reveal that name.
[01:08:49.788 --> 01:08:57.670]  Roberts was wanting to know how you're not concerned about your safety while withholding that kind of explosive information.
[01:08:57.770 --> 01:08:59.731]  So can you elaborate on that for us?
[01:09:00.333 --> 01:09:01.393]  I'd be happy to explain it.
[01:09:01.473 --> 01:09:11.477]  Number one, uh, most of the people who are involved in the false flag and stand down understand what it is I really did over 20 to 30 years.
[01:09:12.497 --> 01:09:17.239]  Uh, I was what you call a solo operant and worked all over the world.
[01:09:17.339 --> 01:09:18.759]  I didn't work for the CIA.
[01:09:18.839 --> 01:09:24.041]  I worked directly for the president or the secretary of state and I did regime change to that gentleman.
[01:09:24.611 --> 01:09:32.898]  And others understand what I do and I won't go into detail and they don't really have to go into understanding how I do it.
[01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:37.672]  But they do understand every one of the neocons knows me exceedingly well.
[01:09:38.812 --> 01:09:45.074]  And remember I had, well, you should know, I had worked with Cheney and Rumsfeld before under the Nixon administration.
[01:09:45.134 --> 01:09:46.455]  I didn't personally know them.
[01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:53.658]  And Rumsfeld was at the Rand Corporation, but I had worked with all the neocons and they weren't allowed under the Bush senior administration.
[01:09:53.738 --> 01:09:57.459]  So the issue of my safety is not really the issue.
[01:09:57.539 --> 01:10:01.201]  I'm just like any other American citizen who served our country.
[01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:02.041]  And I said, you know,
[01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:03.064]  It's enough.
[01:10:03.384 --> 01:10:04.145]  I was Colonel at 32.
[01:10:04.285 --> 01:10:08.149]  I was promoted to Brigadier at 37 or 39.
[01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:09.150]  I refused that.
[01:10:09.611 --> 01:10:11.092]  I didn't go in full time.
[01:10:11.152 --> 01:10:17.279]  I went out to become what every American citizen is as an entrepreneur and basically wanted to live my life.
[01:10:17.859 --> 01:10:24.162]  As I wanted to, and make the mistakes that I could, and criticize the administration while being able to serve it.
[01:10:24.402 --> 01:10:28.624]  And I volunteer still to serve our military, and I'm very proud of that.
[01:10:29.104 --> 01:10:34.007]  I won't go into the details, and I don't ask for money, and I never have, and I don't receive a pension.
[01:10:34.527 --> 01:10:45.272]  But it's a very clear understanding that your American public should understand that if somebody doesn't step forward, I'm no more a hero than a mechanic, a truck driver, or anyone else, and I'm saying this is enough.
[01:10:46.244 --> 01:10:47.866]  And I don't worry for my life.
[01:10:48.106 --> 01:11:00.959]  My life has been at risk serving my country, I don't know, eight, nine different times from the Middle East to the East Asia to Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, with the Red Brigade, with PFLP.
[01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:05.383]  And so I think those who know what I'm saying understand that.
[01:11:05.905 --> 01:11:19.596]  This could be a mutual assured destruction if anything really happened to me, and it would really not be very good for anyone to consider even thinking about terminating me, because it's not an issue.
[01:11:19.756 --> 01:11:21.818]  I mean, I don't need to threaten anybody.
[01:11:21.878 --> 01:11:34.368]  Everybody understands in the business what I do and what I've done, and it would be best for everybody just to cool it and allow an American citizen to say exactly what he wants to say, to criticize a president
[01:11:34.949 --> 01:11:44.179]  Who's not qualified to really be in this position at this point in time, who has maintained a narrative that's totally deceptive, false, a lie.
[01:11:44.959 --> 01:11:53.869]  And basically, the issue is, you know, those who are involved in this deception and in 9-11, they're not going to get away with it.
[01:11:53.929 --> 01:11:55.090]  They have to understand.
[01:11:55.626 --> 01:12:10.617]  The American public will not allow the unresolved issues of 9-11 to go away, as you've seen even a decade later, thanks to people like yourself and Alex Jones, and the wonderful, wonderful people who are listening to this, the radio broadcast.
[01:12:10.777 --> 01:12:15.701]  I don't see myself as any particular hero, or whether there's a death threat, that's fine.
[01:12:16.241 --> 01:12:31.247]  I mean, I do what I do without the concept that they're going to kill me or I'm going to disappear, and that's unfortunate for most people because I feel like the Jeffersonian doctrine, which is every generation has to fight for their own democracy.
[01:12:31.387 --> 01:12:42.052]  So, I'm blessed to be in a country where at the same time I can serve Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Ford, Carter, and Bush Senior, who I admire immensely.
[01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:49.976]  And at the same time be able to criticize his son, who I thought was totally incompetent and totally dangerous, Bush Jr.
[01:12:50.376 --> 01:12:54.158]  And now I see that there's a sequel to that, and that is Obama.
[01:12:54.258 --> 01:13:03.883]  It doesn't matter to me whether you're Republican, Democrat, Independent, or any other spectrum of the policy, but you cannot, I repeat, you cannot
[01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:15.026]  ...continue to have a psyops operation on the American public that wants to justify the increased popularity and self-aggrandizement of a president like either Bush Jr.
[01:13:15.366 --> 01:13:30.750]  or Obama, and he uses that to manipulate the public without telling the truth, and then gets to confabulate stories about an attack where a man was already dead and had a confrontation which never existed,
[01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:37.833]  And an intelligence community that backed it up and knows fully well that they have deceived and lied the American public.
[01:13:37.953 --> 01:13:45.455]  It's important that your audience understand, at this present point, terrorism has become such a big business.
[01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:57.800]  We have over 850,000 people involved around the Washington area in the military-industrial complex, making top-secret relations, which is absurd.
[01:13:58.345 --> 01:14:04.447]  We have TSA that has really never done anything to prevent or protract safety.
[01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:10.770]  And what's important to understand in this point right now for the public, we have been safe for over 30 to 40 years.
[01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:13.571]  Nothing and no one has ever attacked the United States.
[01:14:14.266 --> 01:14:19.148]  The only people who attacked the United States was George Bush, Cheney, and Rumsfeld.
[01:14:19.448 --> 01:14:24.930]  So the nonsense that since 9-11 we have been safe is an absolute lie.
[01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:31.293]  It's a continuous lie and those who believe it are continuously deceiving the American public.
[01:14:31.753 --> 01:14:33.815]  If anything else, it has become worse.
[01:14:34.215 --> 01:14:51.228]  We've exacerbated our relationship with the Pakistani government, the Pakistani military, which I have worked with under Yaqub Khan, and they're very true intelligence operatives who can have the access or have the access that I've had, including with the fundamentalists, Islamic fundamentalists who went to school with me.
[01:14:52.009 --> 01:15:16.221]  And, at the same time, we have become an increasingly policed state, which is exacerbating our economy, the fact that we are going down in our living standards, the fact that people have to have double jobs, there are no jobs available, and this president, all he cares about is garnering a billion dollars to re-elect himself in another narrative, which was totally delusional.
[01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:18.702]  So the problem now isn't about me.
[01:15:19.525 --> 01:15:23.130]  I'm not more a hero than any American who says, look, this is enough.
[01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:24.732]  I'm not going to take this anymore.
[01:15:25.093 --> 01:15:34.906]  But I didn't expect 10 years later for another delusionary panderer called a president, a politician, whether you're Republican or Democrat,
[01:15:35.273 --> 01:15:41.875]  To continue this nonsensical story that we have been attacked by Muslims, which we hadn't been.
[01:15:42.195 --> 01:15:49.718]  We were attacked by our own people in a false flag operation, and the point of the Osama Bin Laden resurrection is
[01:15:50.137 --> 01:15:52.139]  This is the psychological resurrection.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:16:04.250]  If the SEALs attacked anything, then they're going to have to explain to me, who's been in intelligence for a long time and works with special forces, not the SEALs primarily, how they attacked the mortuary.
[01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:04.931]  You know?
[01:16:05.171 --> 01:16:05.851]  Because he's dead.
[01:16:06.232 --> 01:16:09.635]  And he was dead for 9 to 10 years, and there are others who can confirm that.
[01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.645]  The issue at hand now is still more important.
[01:16:12.825 --> 01:16:23.716]  We have to stop this government and other governments from continuing to deceive, deny, and continuously manipulate the American public.
[01:16:23.776 --> 01:16:27.160]  That's why Alex Jones is so important on your radio show.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:28.681]  They can call us conspirators.
[01:16:28.901 --> 01:16:29.442]  I don't care.
[01:16:29.915 --> 01:16:35.317]  You know, that's an incredible, easy way for the intelligence community, which is not very effective, by the way.
[01:16:35.637 --> 01:16:37.677]  And let me give you another little statistic.
[01:16:38.098 --> 01:16:42.339]  80% of the CIA now are composed of mercenaries.
[01:16:42.539 --> 01:16:46.500]  In the days that I worked under Reagan, Bush, and Bush Sr.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.561]  in particular, we had real heroes.
[01:16:49.261 --> 01:16:52.562]  Men who had really served our countries and worked on the Cold War.
[01:16:52.982 --> 01:16:55.463]  They were interesting in self-aggrandizement.
[01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:57.364]  They were interesting in promoting Seal 6.
[01:16:58.923 --> 01:17:10.873]  No special forces unit that I have worked with, including Delta and other units in hostage negotiation, in the Army particularly, has ever come forth and said how great I am and let me show you how great I am.
[01:17:11.394 --> 01:17:21.142]  It is unfortunate that the Navy has a proclivity, including under Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose father happens to have been a publicist for my
[01:17:21.702 --> 01:17:22.483]  We're good to go.
[01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:52.318]  When I was involved under Reagan, the SEALs were lost on a raft, six of them, four to six of them, on an assault grenade.
[01:17:52.658 --> 01:18:03.444]  Now you explain that to me, but every movie I have seen, and your public has ever seen, aggrandizes and self-aggrandizes the SEAL unit, including Demi Moore's film, G.I.
[01:18:03.524 --> 01:18:04.905]  Jane, and other films.
[01:18:05.385 --> 01:18:11.449]  But the units I worked with and had to consult to, you will never know about.
[01:18:11.949 --> 01:18:26.542]  They are dedicated, quiet men and women who have been intellectually exceedingly perceptive, very highly trained, and their job is to do their job, keep it quiet, and go home.
[01:18:27.122 --> 01:18:35.770]  And we're talking about great generals like General Petraeus and other generals who really have served our country, but you don't hear them going out
[01:18:36.352 --> 01:18:46.759]  And creating this fantasy of how they went in there and attacked a man who was out, but wasn't on, who is dead, but isn't dead, but now is floating in the water.
[01:18:46.819 --> 01:18:54.064]  So I warn the Navy, in particular the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, the best he can do, Mullen, is to resign now.
[01:18:54.465 --> 01:18:55.785]  And the same thing with Panetta.
[01:18:55.926 --> 01:19:00.909]  You're not qualified to run the CIA or the military, Secretary of Defense.
[01:19:01.049 --> 01:19:03.751]  And I warn the President of the United States, cease and desist.
[01:19:04.249 --> 01:19:04.609]  We're good.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:26.562]  And contradictory, the more he's going to expose himself to people like myself and others about his own questionable background.
[01:19:26.622 --> 01:19:28.262]  I'm not talking about his birther.
[01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:41.365]  He knows he has a very questionable history and he's treading on very dangerous waters when you come into the world of PsyOps in a world where guys like me and others who I work with are really professional.
[01:19:41.866 --> 01:19:51.491]  I don't go out in public, I don't need to have my picture taken, I don't need to have a uniform, and I don't have to be interviewed every 30 seconds to say how great I am.
[01:19:52.351 --> 01:19:56.934]  Okay, we'll be back to talk more about it after the break with Dr. Steve Puccini.

[01:21:30.274 --> 01:21:31.355]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:21:31.535 --> 01:21:35.918]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:21:36.098 --> 01:21:41.802]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:21:41.902 --> 01:21:45.304]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:45.544 --> 01:21:48.146]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.246 --> 01:21:53.169]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:21:53.309 --> 01:21:53.550]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:22:03.015 --> 01:22:04.956]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[01:22:05.336 --> 01:22:05.856]  The U.S.
[01:22:05.916 --> 01:22:12.639]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[01:22:13.199 --> 01:22:15.840]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[01:22:15.921 --> 01:22:19.162]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[01:22:19.242 --> 01:22:25.825]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[01:22:25.885 --> 01:22:28.486]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[01:22:28.546 --> 01:22:28.986]  Treasuries.
[01:22:29.386 --> 01:22:32.868]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[01:22:32.908 --> 01:22:38.471]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[01:22:38.852 --> 01:22:46.836]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[01:22:47.316 --> 01:22:56.662]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[01:23:00.117 --> 01:23:00.557]  The U.S.
[01:23:00.617 --> 01:23:02.278]  economy is at a tipping point.
[01:23:02.638 --> 01:23:05.380]  Forty cents of every dollar the government spends is borrowed.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:14.144]  The President of the Federal Reserve in Dallas was recently quoted saying, this path will lead to insolvency, resulting in the collapse of our government and our economy.
[01:23:14.524 --> 01:23:17.606]  Our country can't function like this, and neither can your household.
[01:23:17.946 --> 01:23:21.288]  That's why you need to prepare, and priority one is your food supply.
[01:23:22.348 --> 01:23:25.129]  It's easy and affordable with the help of Ready Reserve Foods.

[01:24:15.387 --> 01:24:23.956]  We're back live on the Alex Jones Show, May 5th, 2011, talking to Dr. Steve Pchenik, who has been completely vindicated.
[01:24:24.617 --> 01:24:27.300]  The Situation Room photos were staged.
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:31.024]  Obama and Hillary did not watch the Bin Laden raid.
[01:24:31.064 --> 01:24:35.469]  Obama lied Sunday night on national television when he told Americans that he did.
[01:24:36.770 --> 01:24:41.673]  I want to get your take on that, Steve, and also, we don't have much time, just one more question.
[01:24:42.474 --> 01:24:47.497]  On Sunday, Obama said America was safer because of this staged Bin Laden fable.
[01:24:48.138 --> 01:24:52.861]  They've ramped up the police state, they're talking about putting the terror level up a notch.
[01:24:53.181 --> 01:24:59.165]  How much danger are we in of them staging another false flag inside America within the next few weeks?
[01:25:00.353 --> 01:25:06.161]  Well, I don't want to say they're going to create a false flag, but what he's done is exactly... When you lie, you continuously lie.
[01:25:06.261 --> 01:25:16.254]  So he will lie to create, in order to maintain this lie, he will increase what looks like the presence of counter-terrorist people, TSA and cops and all.
[01:25:16.554 --> 01:25:23.219]  But the reality, the only thing that's effective in terrorism, in counter-terrorism over 30 years, is human intelligence.
[01:25:23.319 --> 01:25:24.239]  And he doesn't have that.
[01:25:24.599 --> 01:25:31.344]  And the CIA doesn't have that, because 80% of them on contract, the ones who have it are in the military, usually the army.
[01:25:31.824 --> 01:25:33.185]  Some elements of the Air Force.
[01:25:33.245 --> 01:25:34.285]  So I'm not worried.
[01:25:34.466 --> 01:25:37.587]  If they pulled another false flag, we're going to have a revolution in America.
[01:25:37.947 --> 01:25:38.568]  And he knows that.
[01:25:38.728 --> 01:25:39.728]  He will understand that.
[01:25:39.748 --> 01:25:41.669]  The intelligence community will understand.
[01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:44.551]  That will precipitate violence in this country.
[01:25:44.711 --> 01:25:53.876]  And I warn the intelligence community that's listening now and the military, do not even think of creating another false flag because that will be the
[01:25:53.936 --> 01:25:54.516]  We're good.
[01:26:15.322 --> 01:26:18.425]  You best get re-elected by understanding what the office is.
[01:26:18.505 --> 01:26:19.726]  It's to serve the public.
[01:26:20.026 --> 01:26:23.208]  It's not to serve your own grandeur and your own narcissism.
[01:26:23.549 --> 01:26:25.110]  It's to serve the American public.
[01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:29.433]  And by increasing the so-called security, you're creating more and more trouble.
[01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:38.040]  You've created more trouble by men and women, our honorable men and women who've gone and fought and died for this nonsense, so that you can get re-elected.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:48.967]  Our veterans coming back without any benefits because you are not able to supply them and you cannot get re-elected on the bodies of the American people and on their welfare.
[01:26:49.027 --> 01:26:57.071]  So I warn you repeatedly, if you think I am just full of air, you better look at my history again on regime change.
[01:26:57.192 --> 01:27:04.496]  It will be very easy to initiate a regime change with you, Mr. President, and everyone around the intelligence community.
[01:27:04.974 --> 01:27:09.596]  If you want to come forth, I'll be happy to discuss it with you, but I believe that President No.
[01:27:09.616 --> 01:27:11.576]  1 is too cowardly, No.
[01:27:11.596 --> 01:27:15.918]  2 not too bright, and his lying will be the undoing of this presidency.
[01:27:16.478 --> 01:27:23.761]  Dr. Puccini, about these staged photos, I mean, you said they were staged, now it's come out that they were, what do you have to say about that?
[01:27:25.017 --> 01:27:28.878]  Well, you know, being right is not good in my life, because I'm a physician.
[01:27:28.938 --> 01:27:33.360]  If I tell you you have cancer, I'm not proud to say that you have cancer.
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:39.562]  Believe me, I have no great satisfaction in saying nine years later that the American public has been duped again.
[01:27:40.002 --> 01:27:44.544]  But I'm warning those who are creating this story, including the intelligence community,
[01:27:45.252 --> 01:27:50.895]  The 850,000 people involved in counter-terrorism, beware of what you do.
[01:27:51.536 --> 01:27:53.197]  You will be held accountable.
[01:27:53.297 --> 01:27:56.199]  The American public will hold you accountable.
[01:27:56.479 --> 01:28:02.142]  There are myself and others who understand exactly who you are, what you are doing.
[01:28:02.522 --> 01:28:06.464]  Do not mess with the American public, and that's my warning.
[01:28:06.805 --> 01:28:12.308]  There will be more deceptions, more lies, but if you increase your TSA, you increase your security,
[01:28:12.728 --> 01:28:18.761]  You will weaken the fibers of our democracy and that will begin the second American Revolution.
[01:28:19.022 --> 01:28:22.730]  And if they don't understand that they better look at what happened to the neocons.
[01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:27.373]  To Scooter Libby and to many others.
[01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:32.376]  So you better understand, once again, I have not given you a false threat.
[01:28:32.776 --> 01:28:35.258]  I am threatening you again on behalf of the Americans.
[01:28:35.418 --> 01:28:41.962]  As an American, do not play with American security, freedom, and the right to protest.
[01:28:42.322 --> 01:28:45.344]  That will be the demise of your institution.
[01:28:46.645 --> 01:28:48.286]  You cannot keep lying.
[01:28:48.526 --> 01:28:54.588]  Your lying will undo this presidency and will undo the fabric of our society.
[01:28:55.148 --> 01:28:56.049]  So be careful.
[01:28:56.189 --> 01:29:00.830]  Your sociopathy got you to the presidency but will not keep you in the presidency.
[01:29:01.311 --> 01:29:02.551]  Those are my final words.
[01:29:02.631 --> 01:29:03.551]  God bless America.
[01:29:05.192 --> 01:29:07.134]  We've got to leave it there, we're out of time.
[01:29:07.494 --> 01:29:13.159]  Really appreciate you spending time with us and we'll be sure to have you back on the show.
[01:29:13.239 --> 01:29:21.906]  There goes Dr. Steve Puchenik with more astounding revelations on the Alex Jones Show and I'm sure that he'll be back on the air very shortly.
[01:29:22.486 --> 01:29:26.990]  Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes and Alex Jones are coming up to host the last
[01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:28.091]  Hour and a half.
[01:29:28.531 --> 01:29:29.932]  I've been Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:29:29.952 --> 01:29:36.958]  Be sure to stay tuned for more groundbreaking information on The Alex Jones Show live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:29:37.318 --> 01:29:38.219]  I'm signing off.
[01:29:38.379 --> 01:29:40.241]  Stay tuned for more after the break.
[01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:52.031]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:54.032]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.029 --> 01:29:57.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.812 --> 01:30:03.313]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.533 --> 01:30:08.576]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:30:08.836 --> 01:30:10.216]  Saving means to make money.
[01:30:10.376 --> 01:30:19.161]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:30:19.901 --> 01:30:27.006]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:30:27.426 --> 01:30:35.051]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:40.355]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:30:40.675 --> 01:30:42.836]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:31:05.636 --> 01:31:08.639]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.879 --> 01:31:13.663]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.683 --> 01:31:19.888]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:20.068 --> 01:31:22.310]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:23.130]  Tim Geithner?
[01:31:23.150 --> 01:31:23.570]  Bernanke?
[01:31:23.671 --> 01:31:24.431]  They're arsonists!
[01:31:24.471 --> 01:31:25.592]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:31:25.612 --> 01:31:27.853]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.741 --> 01:31:48.627]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:31:49.027 --> 01:31:58.154]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:32:00.504 --> 01:32:07.169]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:32:07.449 --> 01:32:09.811]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:12.293]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with eFoots Direct.
[01:32:12.533 --> 01:32:16.697]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:18.378]  You must act automatically.
[01:32:18.618 --> 01:32:21.802]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:32:22.122 --> 01:32:24.585]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:32:24.885 --> 01:32:32.874]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:32:33.255 --> 01:32:36.038]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[01:32:36.278 --> 01:32:45.945]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:32:48.046 --> 01:32:50.548]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[01:33:08.929 --> 01:33:22.153]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.173 --> 01:33:26.334]  We're playing Pass the Bat on here today with hosts, Alex is away.
[01:33:27.296 --> 01:33:27.917]  on business.
[01:33:29.258 --> 01:33:33.602]  You just heard Paul Joseph Watson interviewing Steve Pachenek.
[01:33:34.443 --> 01:33:38.446]  I'm Steve Watson, another of Alex's principal webmasters.
[01:33:39.327 --> 01:33:48.916]  In the third hour we've got Aaron Dykes coming up to present some deep research that he's been working on, which is always interesting to hear.
[01:33:49.476 --> 01:33:52.979]  But today we're talking, obviously, the hot topic
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:07.247]  As President Obama grandstands at Ground Zero, reaping the political benefits of Osama Bin Laden, just as President Bush did before him.
[01:34:08.407 --> 01:34:10.989]  So we're going to get into a bit of the history of
[01:34:11.926 --> 01:34:24.159]  The mythical figure, Bin Laden, who he is, where he's come from and how he's going to be still an icon to be used by the establishment in the future.
[01:34:25.281 --> 01:34:31.347]  Obviously, the facts are getting lost in a froth of false vindication and
[01:34:32.395 --> 01:34:33.776]  So we've got the notion of the
[01:34:52.995 --> 01:35:04.805]  The sort of bad guy we got him, good triumphs over evil, and this idea that our governments represent our own sense of morality, which is obviously a complete theatre.
[01:35:05.345 --> 01:35:10.449]  It's just simply not reflective of reality and the way the world actually works.
[01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:18.035]  And, you know, anyone who actually believes that is either badly misinformed or completely naive, so...
[01:35:19.238 --> 01:35:32.950]  As the listeners of this show and, uh, many more people are aware, uh, the origins of Bin Laden trace us back to, uh, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, um, where he was
[01:35:37.327 --> 01:35:43.890]  him and the Mujahideen were trained and funded by the CIA and the Pentagon Intelligence Services.
[01:35:44.351 --> 01:35:52.255]  So, rather than lingering on that, we'll move on to some other examples of how Bin Laden's been used by
[01:35:53.638 --> 01:36:02.187]  the establishment to forward this idea of the boogeyman, the terror mastermind.
[01:36:03.188 --> 01:36:13.178]  But first it's important to check out the interviews that Alex has conducted over the past week with Steve Pchenik and the interview that we've just heard because
[01:36:15.305 --> 01:36:23.412]  There are people at the moment, detractors, who are just simply, seem to be immune to facts and evidence.
[01:36:25.554 --> 01:36:36.023]  And these articles and these interviews of this, people like Pchenik, someone who's served under five presidents at the highest levels of government, it's important to get these out to people.
[01:36:37.364 --> 01:36:40.627]  You know, to show, to present the evidence, because
[01:36:41.775 --> 01:36:49.442]  For example, earlier this week Alex was on Talk Sport UK radio and callers were calling in.
[01:36:50.777 --> 01:36:57.480]  As he was giving out all the evidence, quoting the experts, and just simply, they were simply not hearing what he was saying.
[01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:03.882]  They were saying he had, all he had was a website and maybe a YouTube video of himself saying these things.
[01:37:04.962 --> 01:37:12.205]  And that's a good clip to, that's a good clip to, and a good interview to get out to people, the TalkSport one.
[01:37:12.225 --> 01:37:18.648]  It's on the Alex Jones channel, the YouTube channel, because it shows that there's a kind of cognitive dissonance going on.
[01:37:18.668 --> 01:37:19.228]  There's a kind of
[01:37:20.672 --> 01:37:27.576]  A divide that's being driven by this faux patriotism that we have to overcome.
[01:37:29.537 --> 01:37:40.004]  The idea that Bin Laden was killed in this hovel which the media for some reason referred to as a million dollar mansion at first.
[01:37:41.024 --> 01:37:43.886]  We've got staged photographs flying around, we've got
[01:37:45.014 --> 01:37:53.919]  You know, even if they do release a video or a photo, it's too late because they've already released a load of nonsense over the past decade.
[01:37:54.019 --> 01:37:58.001]  Fake Bin Laden videos, recycled, rehashed material.
[01:37:58.661 --> 01:38:09.266]  It's important to get these key articles out to people to explain, to get through this cognitive dissonance, this holding two ideas in the head at the same time that conflicts because
[01:38:10.467 --> 01:38:15.610]  You've got this group of people who are almost violently patriotic at the moment with this announcement.
[01:38:16.010 --> 01:38:21.373]  It's a kind of psychological resurrection of the buggyman Bin Laden figure.
[01:38:22.473 --> 01:38:36.140]  And it's very difficult to get through to them without getting these key facts and the words of these experts out to them because at the end of the day we're just people on camera or on the radio telling you these things.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.742]  These people have to go to this stuff and see it for themselves.
[01:38:40.998 --> 01:38:50.454]  But we're going to get into, as I said, we're going to get into the history of this Bin Laden figure over the next couple of segments, and then in the third hour we've got Aaron Dykes.
[01:38:50.534 --> 01:38:52.097]  So let's go back to...
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:39:06.487]  Up until 2001, the sort of, you know, the real death of Bin Laden, which occurred, according to everyone who is in the know, in 2001, shortly after 9-11.
[01:39:07.647 --> 01:39:22.435]  Depending on the specific case that you choose to look at, Bin Laden was either being actively assisted and protected, or willfully ignored and allowed to operate by our governments and intelligence agencies.
[01:39:23.756 --> 01:39:41.508]  In the early 90s he led what became Al-Qaeda to Bosnia shortly after the outbreak of the conflict there to fight against the Bosnian Serbs who subsequently became the target of US-NATO airstrikes.
[01:39:42.289 --> 01:39:45.050]  But during that conflict the Pentagon smuggled
[01:39:45.971 --> 01:39:55.096]  Vast amounts of arms to Bosnian Muslims, led from afar by Bin Laden, all the while knowing they were being led by Bin Laden.
[01:39:55.797 --> 01:40:08.284]  And the arms were smuggled through Croatia, which was in flagrant violation of UN arms embargoes at the time.
[01:40:10.345 --> 01:40:19.331]  They were working in tandem with, actually with Iran and Hezbollah to deliver weapons to these Bosnian Muslims.
[01:40:19.991 --> 01:40:22.573]  They had the financial backing of Saudi Arabia as well.
[01:40:23.213 --> 01:40:36.221]  But the reason for this was because Pentagon was indebted to these fighters stemming from Afghanistan and also stemming from the first Gulf War against Saddam Hussein.
[01:40:38.956 --> 01:40:50.484]  During the Bosnia conflict, they were even involved in airlifting hundreds of these fighters, these Islamist fighters, into Bosnia on black C-130 Hercules aircraft.
[01:40:54.838 --> 01:41:05.728]  I mean, you can search the headline, America used Islamists to arm Bosnian Muslims, and you'll get a lot of articles that break this down.
[01:41:06.509 --> 01:41:14.096]  And, you know, this is one of the first examples of Bin Laden being used as this Western asset.
[01:41:18.343 --> 01:41:32.054]  There's an excellent account actually written by a professor here in the UK called Richard J. Aldrich, who was a professor at Nottingham University where I studied, and he's written articles for The Guardian.
[01:41:33.055 --> 01:41:35.016]  And I think he's now a professor at Warwick University.
[01:41:35.036 --> 01:41:35.816]  He's since moved.
[01:41:36.476 --> 01:41:49.860]  He's put lots of books out there, sort of delving into the, you know, behind-the-scenes intelligence of the Bosnian conflicts and what really went on there with the Pentagon's involvement.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:54.821]  And obviously they set up, following the end of the war,
[01:41:56.176 --> 01:42:09.402]  Uh, they set up terrorist training camps in Bosnia, uh, these Muslims that had been funded, and eventually it was all blowback again, and it came back onto the Pentagon, and they became the ones that eventually, uh...
[01:42:11.343 --> 01:42:39.175]  We were basically in conflict with... So another classic example of the sort of using these groups and Bin Laden as the pawns in the chess game for the Western intelligence services and you know when they're done with them they simply discard them they simply get rid of them or have to fight them and you know when they become useful again they will shift them into a different territory.
[01:42:41.269 --> 01:43:04.804]  As they did when the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia occurred in 1999, where Bin Laden's fighters were moved into Kosovo, which is in Serbia's southern provinces, to aid the Kosovo Liberation Army, which was basically an Albanian terrorist faction.
[01:43:06.145 --> 01:43:21.616]  So again, another example, it was, you know, the US and NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army with Al-Qaeda that were involved in the terrorist acts that were triggering responses from the Serbian authorities that eventually led to the conflicts there.
[01:43:23.057 --> 01:43:33.905]  And, you know, eventually before weeks, and this went on for years, and weeks before 9-11, we were still helping, still using Al-Qaeda there.
[01:43:36.666 --> 01:43:43.568]  Some fighters were airlifted out of Macedonia on US planes, according to German intelligence sources.
[01:43:44.749 --> 01:43:53.831]  Which means, obviously, that our intelligence was still, you know, aiding Al-Qaeda fighters at that time, weeks before 9-11.
[01:43:54.471 --> 01:44:02.733]  And then, of course, there was a similar event which occurred following the invasion of Afghanistan in November 2001, where
[01:44:06.184 --> 01:44:22.176]  Hundreds of fighters, hundreds of Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters were flowing out of Afghanistan into Pakistan on Pakistani cargo planes which couldn't have possibly happened without the Pentagon's knowledge because they'd secured the region at that time.
[01:44:23.797 --> 01:44:34.665]  But sort of, going back to the mid-90s, another place where Bin Laden popped up, this mythical terror mastermind, was
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:46.214]  Libya, 1996, when it was revealed that, uh, by French intelligence that there was a plot to assassinate Gaddafi.
[01:44:47.472 --> 01:44:51.973]  Which obviously has ramifications for what's going on in Libya now.
[01:44:53.254 --> 01:45:10.858]  As it was revealed by French intelligence that Western intelligence services had wired $200,000 to a cell controlled by Bin Laden, which moved into Libya to initiate a grenade attack on Gaddafi.
[01:45:12.139 --> 01:45:16.420]  And after the plot failed, I think the Libyans released
[01:45:18.340 --> 01:45:22.285]  Footage of the attack on TV claiming it was a Western attack.
[01:45:23.466 --> 01:45:32.428]  And this was then verified by sources in, that worked in MI5 here and French Intelligence.
[01:45:33.409 --> 01:45:43.591]  And the Libyans issued an arrest warrant for Bin Laden, which was an Interpol arrest warrant, which was the first actual arrest warrant for him.
[01:45:44.732 --> 01:45:48.613]  But it was actively blocked by MI6, who were obviously
[01:45:50.450 --> 01:46:15.511]  wary of their own ties to the plot to assassinate Gaddafi being exposed and you know this has all been this has all been revealed in mainstream media sources and terrorists from that cell in Libya went on to they were this you know the same terrorists who went on to conduct the bombings in on the embassies in Africa in the late 90s
[01:46:18.303 --> 01:46:33.372]  So again, it's an example of Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda being groomed, funded, trained, used, aided, moved around like pawns in a chess game.
[01:46:35.793 --> 01:46:46.720]  And so, we arrive at the situation now where, you know, we've got Bin Laden as the ultimate buggyman in this crazy false raid
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:54.907]  And it all stems back to this, and we can give a few more examples as well of him being an intelligence asset.
[01:46:54.947 --> 01:47:07.560]  We can point to the time he was in Sudan, and around the same time as the Libya plot in the mid-90s, it was known that he was in Sudan.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:11.344]  The government there contacted the CIA and offered to have him arrested.
[01:47:13.231 --> 01:47:15.593]  Obviously it was the Clinton administration at this time.
[01:47:16.554 --> 01:47:27.887]  They offered to have him arrested and shipped off to Saudi Arabia where he could be held in custody and then extracted from there by the Americans should they wish to do so.
[01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:31.011]  But the Clinton administration turned it down.
[01:47:31.972 --> 01:47:48.638]  Turn the offer down from the Sudanese government because they said they didn't have enough of a case to indict Bin Laden which is on its face ridiculous because at the time he was publicly known as
[01:47:50.137 --> 01:47:54.141]  You know, the greatest financier of terrorist projects around the world.
[01:47:54.502 --> 01:48:00.248]  Obviously, behind the scenes, there's more going on to them, but publicly that's what he was known as.
[01:48:00.308 --> 01:48:04.913]  But still, the Clinton administration didn't have
[01:48:06.454 --> 01:48:18.618]  A case, it claimed, so that was the first opportunity they had to capture him and extract him and deal with him back then, all those years before 9-11.
[01:48:20.138 --> 01:48:29.661]  And the Saudis refused to cooperate with it anyway, obviously because of their own intelligence ties to him as well.
[01:48:29.901 --> 01:48:31.942]  So, I mean, the fallout of all that was
[01:48:32.964 --> 01:48:39.012]  Bin Laden was expelled from Sudan and he went to Afghanistan where we know he, uh...
[01:48:41.809 --> 01:48:43.650]  Went on to conduct all the other plots he did.
[01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:54.155]  He chartered a flight from Afghanistan in 1996 with 150 followers, including some of his family, to Afghanistan.
[01:48:54.335 --> 01:49:04.499]  And on the way, the plane actually stopped and refuelled in Qatar, the Gulf state of Qatar, which is also an ally, a friendly nation to Washington.
[01:49:07.081 --> 01:49:17.130]  So, I mean, the authorities there would have known, would have contacted the Americans, but still he was allowed to proceed after that stop in Qatar.
[01:49:17.690 --> 01:49:24.897]  And there were also, you know, other opportunities for Clinton to capture and bring to justice bin Laden.
[01:49:26.458 --> 01:49:27.259]  In 2000, the Taliban
[01:49:29.147 --> 01:49:35.413]  Offered to hand Bin Laden over to a Gulf state through unofficial channels.
[01:49:35.993 --> 01:49:44.061]  Contacted the Clinton administration and offered to do this, but the provisor was it was through unofficial channels.
[01:49:46.963 --> 01:49:59.812]  They sent out, at the time, the senior counter-terrorism advisor Richard Clarke, who has since gone on to reveal a lot of interesting facts about what went on at that time.
[01:50:01.794 --> 01:50:03.435]  They sent Richard Clarke to
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:15.370]  To the United Arab Emirates, which was the Gulf state involved in supposedly taking Bin Laden from the Taliban.
[01:50:17.072 --> 01:50:21.477]  The United Arab Emirates later denied that there was any kind of plot.
[01:50:22.558 --> 01:50:37.163]  Uh, to offer Bin Laden over and it was basically revealed that because the White House had gone through official channels and not unofficial channels to do all this, as had been demanded, that the opportunity fell through again.
[01:50:37.183 --> 01:50:37.223]  So...
[01:50:41.566 --> 01:50:45.687]  You can search for details of all these opportunities to seize Bin Laden.
[01:50:45.707 --> 01:50:54.590]  I think it was the Sunday Times that broke this a number of years ago and the articles are still out there, so all this information is still out there.
[01:50:55.410 --> 01:50:57.811]  After we come back from the break, we're going to look at
[01:50:59.918 --> 01:51:00.959]  Opportunities post 9-11.
[01:51:18.453 --> 01:51:23.134]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:54:11.869 --> 01:54:13.230]  As we continue to
[01:54:27.705 --> 01:54:30.146]  Don't be told that we're going to be attacked any second.
[01:54:30.746 --> 01:54:41.710]  We're under more danger now than we were before as the TSA continues to fry travellers in the airports and stick their hands down your trousers.
[01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:50.013]  We're discussing the psychological resurrection of Osama Bin Laden on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:50.073 --> 01:54:50.953]  I'm Steve Watson.
[01:54:51.013 --> 01:54:52.514]  Alex is away for a couple of days.
[01:54:53.878 --> 01:54:58.362]  Like I said before we've got Aaron Dykes coming up in the third hour so stay around for that.
[01:54:58.942 --> 01:55:08.389]  Before we were discussing chances to grab Bin Laden that were overlooked or ignored purposefully previous to 9-11.
[01:55:13.428 --> 01:55:27.004]  And as Sybil Edmonds, the FBI translator, has famously testified, Bin Laden was working with the CIA right up until 9-11 and beyond 9-11 really because
[01:55:32.403 --> 01:55:50.787]  We had reports of Bin Laden being visited by CIA officials in July 2001 in a hospital in Dubai, an American hospital, where he was being treated for kidney disease.
[01:55:51.367 --> 01:55:57.349]  And the CIA agents visited there and later bragged about this.
[01:56:00.273 --> 01:56:26.016]  Obviously he was reported to have serious kidney disease and that is a factor in the reason why many people believe this current raid hoax to be just that, a hoax, because he's been dead for a long time, because there's no way he could have been hiding out on a kidney dialysis machine, plotting the greatest, the biggest terrorist plot in the history of America, in the history of the world.
[01:56:27.318 --> 01:56:37.236]  I mean, it's relatively common knowledge as well that the Bin Laden family was allowed to be flown out of the US following the attacks.
[01:56:39.989 --> 01:56:43.031]  If you've seen Michael Moore's film, it's even in there, he goes into it.
[01:56:43.572 --> 01:56:56.342]  So that's relatively common knowledge, but what's not common knowledge about that is the fact that the FBI knowingly allowed one of those flights to be chartered by Bin Laden himself.
[01:56:57.162 --> 01:56:58.623]  This is something we revealed
[01:57:00.865 --> 01:57:17.905]  In 2007, 2008, when Judicial Watch, the sort of watchdog, the government watchdog, obtained documents through the Freedom of Information Act which outlined the fact that the FBI
[01:57:19.517 --> 01:57:33.482]  knew that one of the flights that the Bin Laden family, which is a vast extensive family of Saudi millionaires, were flown out of the US after 9-11.
[01:57:33.802 --> 01:57:37.424]  They knew that one of the flights was chartered by Bin Laden himself.
[01:57:39.434 --> 01:57:54.469]  Which is incredible given that he was, you must remember that in the, in the early, in the first early days after 9-11, you know, it was only the media that was speculating that Bin Laden was the big mastermind behind the operation.
[01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:57.852]  So, at that time, um,
[01:58:00.928 --> 01:58:13.022]  It wasn't, you know, it wasn't official, but the FBI still knew that he was, you know, the biggest terrorist in the world, and they'd allowed him to charter a flight, uh, with his own family out of the, out of the US.
[01:58:13.062 --> 01:58:15.805]  So, we'll get into more about this after the break.
[01:58:16.686 --> 01:58:18.268]  And now we've got Aaron Dykes coming up.
[01:58:18.929 --> 01:58:21.452]  Uh, so stay tuned, this is the Alex Jones Show Live.
[01:58:42.293 --> 01:58:44.154]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:50.779 --> 01:58:51.920]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:58.644]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:58:58.884 --> 01:59:01.166]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:59:01.426 --> 01:59:06.649]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.809 --> 01:59:09.591]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:59:09.852 --> 01:59:11.933]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:59:12.153 --> 01:59:18.098]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:59:18.418 --> 01:59:21.620]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:27.324]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:59:27.565 --> 01:59:28.886]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:59:29.206 --> 01:59:30.407]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:59:30.507 --> 01:59:33.069]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:59:33.189 --> 01:59:37.252]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:59:56.131 --> 01:59:58.914]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.509 --> 02:00:09.694]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.335 --> 02:00:11.155]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.936 --> 02:00:12.837]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.478 --> 02:00:17.142]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.663 --> 02:00:21.728]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.798 --> 02:00:26.099]  So this is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.139 --> 02:00:27.080]  I'm Steve Watson.
[02:00:28.161 --> 02:00:29.283]  Alex is away on business.
[02:00:29.363 --> 02:00:35.329]  We're passing the baton, as it were, today between hosts to try and keep the show crisp for you.
[02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:38.272]  We've got Aaron Dykes coming up now.
[02:00:39.333 --> 02:00:46.340]  I was talking about the fact that Bin Laden had been allowed to charter a flight himself
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:01:00.348]  Knowingly by the FBI after 9-11 out of the US, which to many people is just unbelievable, that the documents are there, the FBI actually redacted Bin Laden's name from the documents, took his name out.
[02:01:02.102 --> 02:01:05.865]  I'll cover up the fact that it was Bin Laden.
[02:01:06.686 --> 02:01:16.714]  You can search for this, you'll find articles on this, plenty of articles, one written by myself where I point to mainstream sources and the documents themselves released by Judicial Watch.
[02:01:17.535 --> 02:01:25.261]  Of course, after this, there was never a formal indictment of Bin Laden for 9-11 by the FBI because they said
[02:01:26.002 --> 02:01:31.949]  From their own mouths, there was simply not enough evidence to go on that he was involved in the plot.
[02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:36.954]  Right up until his supposed death, he's never been indicted for that.
[02:01:38.576 --> 02:01:46.685]  Today we learned that the civil court case is being dropped in New York against Bin Laden because he's now
[02:01:47.626 --> 02:01:49.188]  Been put out to pasture, he's now dead.
[02:01:50.150 --> 02:01:50.630]  Officially.
[02:01:51.892 --> 02:02:04.069]  But you know, we had other documents such as the W199I document, which the Bush administration basically ordered the FBI to back off investigating the Bin Laden family.
[02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:22.261]  Pre prior to 9-11 and it just goes on and on and on and the bottom line is this whole we've got him thing now is completely asinine and it requires a it requires a worldview that is just completely beyond belief naive and also requires a
[02:02:23.161 --> 02:02:36.644]  A dangerously unquestioning, unswerving attitude towards our own governments and their secret services which have been engaged in illegal activity all over the globe for as long as we can remember.
[02:02:38.584 --> 02:02:40.945]  Let's bring Aaron up here to see what he thinks about this.
[02:02:40.965 --> 02:02:41.625]  Aaron, are you there?
[02:02:42.385 --> 02:02:43.325]  I am here, Steve.
[02:02:43.405 --> 02:02:44.645]  It's good to be on with you.
[02:02:44.665 --> 02:02:47.426]  Go ahead, please.
[02:02:48.586 --> 02:02:52.507]  So I was just going to ask you what information you've got coming up in the next hour.
[02:02:53.875 --> 02:02:59.157]  You know, I really want to get into the whole case of how the Obama administration is trying to control reality.
[02:02:59.797 --> 02:03:06.679]  We've got all these conflicting stories, and I think it's really the first time we've seen the president playing with the info war.
[02:03:07.559 --> 02:03:13.741]  But the fact is, reality is reality, and they can't control a lemon story any better than anyone else can.
[02:03:14.241 --> 02:03:23.104]  Nothing has ever added up about this 9-11 case, and I guess bin Laden's death is primarily a fairytale ending to a classic fairytale.
[02:03:25.185 --> 02:03:41.675]  Yeah, and it's this whole sort of cognitive dissonance thing, because, you know, by now people know that a lot of these facts that we've continually been bringing up for the last ten years, by now they know that they're true, a lot of people, so they're holding in their heads at the same time two
[02:03:42.515 --> 02:03:49.581]  Conflicting ideas and they're choosing not to, you know, they're choosing not to recognize it because it's, you know, it's easier for them.
[02:03:51.122 --> 02:03:59.288]  You know, but at the same time they've seen the endless wars, the build-up of the domestic police state and everything that our governments have lied to us about.
[02:04:00.890 --> 02:04:08.035]  But yet there's still this group of people that are just blindly accepting the illusion, this fable that's being put out there.
[02:04:08.055 --> 02:04:11.278]  I mean, where do you see this heading after
[02:04:11.798 --> 02:04:14.006]  You know, Obama's big grandstand today.
[02:04:15.228 --> 02:04:17.410]  Well, he's of course trying to get political points.
[02:04:17.610 --> 02:04:21.793]  I've seen some of the footage, as I'm sure others have, of him at ground zero.
[02:04:22.554 --> 02:04:26.137]  But mainly, we know that they plan to continue this war on terror.
[02:04:26.817 --> 02:04:29.659]  There's the Libya front, where al-Qaeda is now an ally.
[02:04:29.679 --> 02:04:34.223]  And that really conflicts with the really old, out-of-date bin Laden story.
[02:04:34.804 --> 02:04:37.826]  And I think they're looking to rebrand that, so they can rewrite the narrative.
[02:04:37.866 --> 02:04:38.727]  Kind of new rules.
[02:04:39.707 --> 02:04:41.269]  But I'll get more into that on the other side.
[02:04:42.352 --> 02:04:43.073]  Yep, good job.
[02:04:43.714 --> 02:04:46.719]  I'm Steve Watson, cheers for having me, and over to Aaron now.
[02:05:01.414 --> 02:05:02.916]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:03.116 --> 02:05:08.161]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:05:08.441 --> 02:05:09.802]  Saving means to make money.
[02:05:09.963 --> 02:05:18.751]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:05:19.492 --> 02:05:26.597]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:05:27.018 --> 02:05:34.643]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:05:35.024 --> 02:05:42.429]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you had to do something you've never done before, getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[02:06:00.848 --> 02:06:15.319]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.003]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:21.007 --> 02:06:33.020]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:06:33.781 --> 02:06:41.049]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:51.318]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:06:52.099 --> 02:06:55.361]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:06:56.022 --> 02:06:59.125]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:03.886]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:04.186 --> 02:07:04.807]  Number one.
[02:07:05.107 --> 02:07:08.248]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:08.528 --> 02:07:09.108]  Number two.
[02:07:09.388 --> 02:07:13.930]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:14.730]  It's true.
[02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:19.571]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:19.891 --> 02:07:20.452]  Number three.
[02:07:20.712 --> 02:07:24.013]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:24.313 --> 02:07:27.994]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:28.214 --> 02:07:28.754]  Number 4.
[02:07:29.015 --> 02:07:31.376]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:35.159]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:07:35.460 --> 02:07:35.660]  Number 5.
[02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:40.163]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:07:40.383 --> 02:07:45.147]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:07:45.427 --> 02:07:49.450]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:49.610 --> 02:07:51.171]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:51.392 --> 02:07:53.473]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:07:53.633 --> 02:07:56.255]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:07:56.475 --> 02:08:03.080]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:03.621 --> 02:08:06.423]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.912 --> 02:08:20.174]  Okay, we are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:20.294 --> 02:08:21.295]  Alex is out for the day.
[02:08:21.395 --> 02:08:22.175]  I'm Aaron Dykes.
[02:08:22.876 --> 02:08:34.823]  You've heard Steve and Paul Joseph Watson, and just our incredible guest, Pichesnik, you know, willing to speak out even more than he has before, and of course, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:08:35.603 --> 02:08:46.210]  Of course, we've got to go more into the Bin Laden death hoax, which really, of course, has to do with Obama's sagging poll numbers, practically a
[02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:48.491]  Uh, defeated presidency.
[02:08:49.132 --> 02:08:51.994]  And, uh, you know, of course they're spending it for political points.
[02:08:52.034 --> 02:08:56.457]  Of course he's down at ground zero trying to give closure to the whole 9-11 myth.
[02:08:58.078 --> 02:09:02.240]  But the way I see it, it's really a milestone in the InfoWar.
[02:09:02.421 --> 02:09:08.525]  Even if they win short term, even though their story is falling apart, they've got conflicting reports.
[02:09:08.565 --> 02:09:12.067]  They can't even agree on what was going on in this Bin Laden bunker.
[02:09:12.687 --> 02:09:15.309]  And we'll get more into that in just a second, but just to
[02:09:16.650 --> 02:09:17.511]  Point out the obvious.
[02:09:17.591 --> 02:09:30.469]  Why couldn't they show a photo not only of Bin Laden and his death when he's gruesome, but why couldn't they show a still from these cameras that were in during the raid showing him in his last moments alive, etc.
[02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:32.491]  But I really question whether
[02:09:33.232 --> 02:09:43.719]  Obama is at that Nixonian point where he's taken his enemies personally, sees his critics in the world as enemies, and is really trying to score points with them.
[02:09:44.480 --> 02:09:49.944]  He seemed very bitter in having to release his birth certificate, basic proof of his eligibility.
[02:09:50.844 --> 02:09:57.369]  Now he seems very bitter at the idea of having to release bin Laden photos, saying that no one's going to believe it anyway.
[02:09:58.209 --> 02:10:14.687]  And we really heard from Secretary Clinton a few months ago really identifying that this is an info war and that in fact the government, the State Department, the Obama administration, the Bush administration for that matter, are losing that info war.
[02:10:14.807 --> 02:10:17.630]  Everything about the 9-11 lie has been picked apart.
[02:10:18.751 --> 02:10:39.065]  For nearly a decade now, of course, it's never made sense and I guess it just adds up that a fairy tale would have a fairy tale conclusion with a mythological death of Bin Laden, no photos, no evidence, DNA supposedly matched before there's time to conduct a proper test, buried at sea.
[02:10:39.966 --> 02:10:41.427]  Do we have the clip of Hillary Clinton?
[02:10:44.130 --> 02:10:45.611]  Yeah, let's pull that up and get it ready.
[02:10:46.271 --> 02:10:49.652]  It's really an info war where we're winning.
[02:10:49.692 --> 02:10:56.455]  We've all, the supposed conspiracy theorists, have pointed out inconsistencies, brought up facts when they're available.
[02:10:57.575 --> 02:11:09.300]  You know, sure there's people trying to figure out what may have happened, but generally we're picking apart this terrible, unstable, impossible official story and it just doesn't add up.
[02:11:10.466 --> 02:11:11.909]  And here we have it.
[02:11:11.929 --> 02:11:13.192]  It's an admitted info war.
[02:11:13.252 --> 02:11:17.022]  We know disinformation and spam is put out by the government.
[02:11:17.523 --> 02:11:18.927]  Let's cue that Hillary Clinton clip.
[02:11:19.594 --> 02:11:22.136]  We are engaged in an information war.
[02:11:22.756 --> 02:11:27.339]  You know, during the Cold War, we did a great job in getting America's message out.
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.602]  After the Berlin Wall fell, we said, OK, fine, enough of that.
[02:11:30.762 --> 02:11:31.582]  You know, we've done it.
[02:11:31.662 --> 02:11:32.123]  We're done.
[02:11:33.204 --> 02:11:35.805]  And unfortunately, we are paying a big price for it.
[02:11:36.366 --> 02:11:39.888]  And our private media cannot fill that gap.
[02:11:40.048 --> 02:11:40.469]  In fact,
[02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:50.696]  Our private media, particularly cultural programming, often works at counter-purposes to what we truly are as Americans and what our values are.
[02:11:50.716 --> 02:11:58.242]  I remember having an Afghan general tell me that the only thing he thought about Americans is that all the men wrestled and the women walked...
[02:11:59.133 --> 02:12:05.558]  So you see, you know, opening up roles for state-controlled media, state-planted propaganda.
[02:12:05.618 --> 02:12:07.420]  We know what Cass Sunstein has written.
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:15.727]  They want to have plants to rebut supposed conspiracy theorists, to counter information they don't think is
[02:12:16.127 --> 02:12:33.068]  Politically expedient or that doesn't help prop up their regime and really what it amounts to a pile of lies I bring this up even though it's a few months old because it really is an info war and I think we're seeing the moment where Obama is taking a personal part in that info war
[02:12:33.969 --> 02:12:34.749]  Which we're winning.
[02:12:35.129 --> 02:12:36.930]  I'm leading up to an Alex Jones clip.
[02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:40.470]  You would have seen it on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:12:40.971 --> 02:12:43.591]  Alex Jones mega rant, unleashed, winning.
[02:12:43.791 --> 02:12:45.191]  You don't dictate reality.
[02:12:45.651 --> 02:12:47.572]  I'm the king of reality, not conspiracy.
[02:12:48.412 --> 02:12:50.432]  That's not Alex on an ego trip.
[02:12:50.973 --> 02:12:53.173]  As you know, he says you in the clip.
[02:12:53.613 --> 02:12:59.974]  I mean, he's the first person in the clip because he's engaged with this British host and these callers, as we're going to hear in a minute.
[02:13:00.354 --> 02:13:02.115]  But he's really talking about the
[02:13:03.206 --> 02:13:11.451]  People who've tried to uncover the truth on 9-11 and so many other topics that we're winning and they can't dictate a false reality.
[02:13:12.192 --> 02:13:15.314]  They can't even hold up a false story about Bin Laden's death.
[02:13:15.394 --> 02:13:17.275]  It's completely falling apart at the seams.
[02:13:19.256 --> 02:13:24.200]  Very likely evidence of Senators being deliberately fed disinformation.
[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:43.296]  Senators Scott Brown, Senator Saxby Chambliss, and other Senators admit they were conned by a totally fake bin Laden photo, which they in turn used to declare that yes, in fact, he's dead, don't question this, and they were in fact conned
[02:13:44.016 --> 02:13:56.616]  We don't know exactly deliberately but I think it's highly likely they were deliberately steered to believing that in fact Bin Laden was dead based on false photographic evidence and we know that many family members
[02:13:58.137 --> 02:14:03.885]  Headline 9-11 family invited to presidential ground zero snubs Obama demands to see the photo.
[02:14:04.666 --> 02:14:13.938]  We have Canadian members of the NDP demanding to see photos saying they have doubts that the US even has these photos and why not?
[02:14:14.538 --> 02:14:41.324]  uh... when there's no evidence there's every reason to doubt what's going on and demand more information uh... so we're gonna get more into how the administration's trying to build uh... this this kingdom of lies uh... with this fairytale ending to the 9-11 myth so they can rebrand al-qaeda for a new era of the war on terror which they say could be a another hundred year war uh... you know like seven hundred years ago in europe uh... but let's go to the Alex Jones clip
[02:14:42.918 --> 02:14:45.719]  Just told you Anwar al-Awlaki's secretly hanging out at the Pentagon!
[02:14:45.939 --> 02:14:46.960]  Confirmed, admitted!
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:47.740]  Come on!
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:48.661]  Pull the trigger!
[02:14:48.961 --> 02:14:49.641]  Pull the trigger!
[02:14:50.041 --> 02:14:51.262]  Elizabeth, thank you for that.
[02:14:51.362 --> 02:14:52.002]  Great to have you on.
[02:14:52.242 --> 02:14:54.303]  Let's take another... There goes Elizabeth.
[02:14:54.323 --> 02:14:57.524]  Let's take another call from Daniel, who's near Watford.
[02:14:57.564 --> 02:14:57.925]  Daniel.
[02:14:58.685 --> 02:14:59.025]  Hello.
[02:14:59.245 --> 02:14:59.785]  Good evening, sir.
[02:14:59.805 --> 02:15:00.606]  What would you like to say?
[02:15:01.106 --> 02:15:01.566]  Hi, good evening.
[02:15:01.606 --> 02:15:03.127]  I just wanted to cover a few points.
[02:15:03.167 --> 02:15:03.367]  I mean...
[02:15:03.849 --> 02:15:10.392]  I've obviously been listening for the last hour or so and I strongly disagree with quite a few of the things you've said now.
[02:15:10.753 --> 02:15:13.534]  That I've said or Alex has said?
[02:15:13.994 --> 02:15:14.735]  Alex has said.
[02:15:14.755 --> 02:15:19.037]  I mean what you've said and neither here nor there.
[02:15:19.057 --> 02:15:23.099]  So I mean Alex, really the question I've got to ask you is
[02:15:24.308 --> 02:15:29.955]  How can you possibly say that any of this mission to do with killing Osama Bin Laden was set up in any way?
[02:15:29.975 --> 02:15:33.860]  Now, I mean, you take the situation... I mean, you're laughing already.
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:36.784]  I mean, for example, I mean, take what the last guy that was on just said.
[02:15:36.804 --> 02:15:37.605]  I completely agree with him.
[02:15:37.745 --> 02:15:42.551]  Everything you ever say and everyone that is like you that is a conspiracy theorist, and I do categorize
[02:15:42.651 --> 02:15:45.855]  Conspiracy theorists who relish the word!
[02:15:46.075 --> 02:15:57.187]  You don't have any intellectual acumen, any gravitas, you just have a label so you can, your mind, can decide snobberishly to say that I don't have documentation.
[02:15:57.327 --> 02:15:59.229]  Let me stop right there, let me stop right there.
[02:16:00.310 --> 02:16:01.331]  What was the point you're saying?
[02:16:01.371 --> 02:16:02.012]  How can I say?
[02:16:02.032 --> 02:16:02.853]  Did you not hear me?
[02:16:03.334 --> 02:16:11.783]  May 25th, 2010, Washington Post, the CIA, admits that they created fake Bin Laden videos.
[02:16:12.244 --> 02:16:14.726]  So a group that has created fake videos...
[02:16:15.407 --> 02:16:16.208]  That's what you've said, yeah?
[02:16:16.408 --> 02:16:23.473]  So the fact that you and your friends have made a video and put it on YouTube, that makes it... You're showing who the conspiracy theory is.
[02:16:23.894 --> 02:16:30.139]  I just gave you the date and what to search, Washington Post, and you just...
[02:16:30.979 --> 02:16:32.820]  And you just said it's going to be on YouTube.
[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:36.843]  I just told you, buddy boy, my source is not YouTube.
[02:16:37.143 --> 02:16:39.184]  My source is what I just told you.
[02:16:39.204 --> 02:16:48.709]  And when I say Steve Pachenek was on or Hamid Ghul was on, these are serious, well-known, respected people today agreeing with me.
[02:16:49.990 --> 02:16:53.693]  You, hey, go ahead, listen, you can't handle the truth!
[02:16:53.913 --> 02:16:56.736]  You can't handle real intellect and red blood!
[02:16:57.116 --> 02:17:01.019]  All you've got is shooting your mouth off with that cliched term!
[02:17:01.240 --> 02:17:04.222]  I'm not the king of conspiracy, I'm the king of reality!
[02:17:04.923 --> 02:17:06.824]  Daniel, come back on that.
[02:17:06.944 --> 02:17:07.485]  In 30 seconds.
[02:17:07.765 --> 02:17:09.947]  I told you Washington Post, listen to me!
[02:17:10.187 --> 02:17:15.592]  I bet you don't believe, I bet you don't believe that Geraldo Rivera was a Marines in Mid-Sacramento!
[02:17:16.112 --> 02:17:17.994]  Alex, let Dan respond to that.
[02:17:18.781 --> 02:17:24.183]  In general society, there is a very small sect of people that would be classed... You're a minority!
[02:17:24.243 --> 02:17:25.364]  We're the majority!
[02:17:25.424 --> 02:17:26.925]  Listen to your mind-control garbage!
[02:17:27.345 --> 02:17:34.108]  I would class you in an extremist group that would account for not... I need to be dealt with immediately!
[02:17:34.168 --> 02:17:34.928]  Listen to him!
[02:17:34.988 --> 02:17:36.889]  He don't believe the Queen loves us!
[02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:44.533]  I need to be shut down under the EU Convention on Spreading Radicalism!
[02:17:44.833 --> 02:17:45.494]  Shut him up!
[02:17:45.814 --> 02:17:46.474]  Shut him up!
[02:17:46.734 --> 02:17:47.835]  I don't agree with him!
[02:17:48.015 --> 02:17:49.536]  He's giving me too many facts!
[02:17:49.796 --> 02:17:50.497]  It's scary!
[02:17:50.657 --> 02:17:51.537]  He's an extremist!
[02:17:51.597 --> 02:17:52.918]  He's a minority!
[02:17:53.158 --> 02:17:54.599]  Oh, I'm a minority!
[02:17:54.759 --> 02:18:01.603]  That's why my YouTube videos have millions of views apiece and 98% of people are voting that they like it!
[02:18:01.803 --> 02:18:03.864]  That's why I have millions of listeners!
[02:18:04.144 --> 02:18:06.566]  That's why I'm loved all over the world!
[02:18:06.846 --> 02:18:08.847]  Because I'm a dangerous minority!
[02:18:09.127 --> 02:18:09.828]  You listen to me!
[02:18:10.128 --> 02:18:12.869]  Ideas are bulletproof and you cannot stop us!
[02:18:13.129 --> 02:18:14.210]  Liberty is rising!
[02:18:14.430 --> 02:18:17.391]  The spirit of 1776 is indomitable!
[02:18:17.631 --> 02:18:24.315]  And you are a mind-controlled weasel who feels solace in joining the hive board of weak disinformation!
[02:18:24.775 --> 02:18:26.216]  You are not the intellectual!
[02:18:26.476 --> 02:18:29.877]  You are not the person to dictate to me what reality is!
[02:18:30.158 --> 02:18:32.859]  Do you understand me, boy?
[02:18:33.199 --> 02:18:34.760]  Do you understand me, boy?
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:37.902]  Come on Alex, let's just make that clip out.
[02:18:37.962 --> 02:18:55.253]  It's a really incredible battle between Alex and just the ideologically dense listeners who refuse to embrace the facts, look at the reality, factors like the fact that opium is more important than any supposed act of Osama Bin Laden.
[02:18:56.033 --> 02:19:03.178]  In the real war on terror, so-called, in Afghanistan, opium and oil and geopolitics, that's what's really at play.
[02:19:04.659 --> 02:19:11.488]  But more importantly, Alex makes the point that we are winning in reality because so much disinformation is put out by the system.
[02:19:12.329 --> 02:19:15.914]  These mindless drones can't even face reality.
[02:19:16.655 --> 02:19:20.560]  They try to belittle Alex, consider him to be a minority.
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:21.882]  He's preaching hate speech.
[02:19:21.902 --> 02:19:23.224]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:19:23.644 --> 02:19:25.745]  But really, Alex has always stuck by the facts.
[02:19:25.765 --> 02:19:27.627]  He's been vindicated over the decades.
[02:19:28.067 --> 02:19:30.368]  And so has everyone else who's been fighting in this war.
[02:19:31.029 --> 02:19:32.270]  Just an incredible clip.
[02:19:32.570 --> 02:19:39.274]  But it just goes to show, as this Bin Laden hoax is totally falling apart, we'll get into more of those details on the way back.
[02:19:39.895 --> 02:19:44.017]  All about how they changed the story of what even happened during this supposed Bin Laden raid.
[02:19:44.698 --> 02:19:46.139]  All part of the 9-11 fairy tale.
[02:19:46.159 --> 02:19:46.759]  We'll be back.
[02:19:46.779 --> 02:19:49.421]  Infowars.com on the other side of this world.

[02:21:58.748 --> 02:22:01.291]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:22:01.571 --> 02:22:17.064]  The earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless, all caused by the devalued U.S.
[02:22:17.124 --> 02:22:17.404]  dollar.
[02:22:17.464 --> 02:22:22.889]  While the mainstream media continues to ignore inflation, our friends at the National Inflation Association provide.
[02:22:23.129 --> 02:22:28.113]  A free weekly newsletter that educates Americans of the facts and truth about the US economy and inflation.

[02:22:38.442 --> 02:22:44.507]  Silver has more than doubled since the NIA declared silver the best investment for the next decade on inflation.us.
[02:22:44.827 --> 02:22:54.009]  The NIA's team of expert economists are happy to answer any economic questions you have about inflation, debt, currencies, real estate, precious metals, and commodities.

[02:22:59.470 --> 02:23:02.611]  Do you want to learn more about preparing for the hard times ahead?
[02:23:02.731 --> 02:23:07.312]  Have you ever thought about actually getting off the grid and becoming truly self-reliant?

[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:28.321]  We are back.
[02:24:28.361 --> 02:24:29.362]  That is news.
[02:24:29.462 --> 02:24:31.163]  We are winning the resistance.
[02:24:31.223 --> 02:24:32.564]  We're winning the InfoWar.
[02:24:32.604 --> 02:24:44.535]  You just heard Alex on TalkSport in the UK, brushing aside the silly arguments from the host and from these callers, completely out of the real reality paradigm.
[02:24:44.955 --> 02:24:49.658]  We don't know everything that's going on, but we are trying to follow the facts and break apart these lies.
[02:24:50.178 --> 02:25:03.585]  Meanwhile, we have an Obama administration who's admittedly been given a difficult task because he's expected to continue all the lies and propaganda that were built up in the post 9-11 era by the Bush administration.
[02:25:04.426 --> 02:25:11.590]  We know the whole thing is one big lie from saying they could never foresee the attacks coming, despite the fact that there were
[02:25:12.330 --> 02:25:41.970]  Military drills with bin laden's face and the twin towers on the cover Despite the fact that they had intelligence reports the presidential PDB 51 briefing Declaring that bin laden was determined to attack despite that we saw Condoleezza Rice and Bush saying they never could have even imagined That something would happen Akin to 9-11 it's all a lie, but at the same time we have Obama with floundering ratings really trying to
[02:25:43.031 --> 02:25:43.331]  I'm not sure.
[02:26:01.346 --> 02:26:03.387]  Transparent administration of all time.
[02:26:03.748 --> 02:26:04.808]  He's anything but.
[02:26:05.169 --> 02:26:07.210]  He's continued Guantanamo Bay.
[02:26:08.151 --> 02:26:10.432]  He's continued harsh interrogations.
[02:26:11.213 --> 02:26:15.776]  Obviously continued the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while expanding into Libya.
[02:26:16.376 --> 02:26:20.899]  And really it's hit a juncture where the al-Qaeda myth has to be rebranded.
[02:26:20.919 --> 02:26:24.241]  There has to be a new set of rules for this war on terror.
[02:26:25.322 --> 02:26:34.165]  I think the point came where they had to put Bin Laden to bed sooner or later, and it was a politically expedient time to hopefully bolster Obama's ratings.
[02:26:34.225 --> 02:26:37.926]  We did see a jump, but it's already been going back down.
[02:26:38.266 --> 02:26:46.628]  That is the approval for Obama, and he's really in this position where they've claimed a certain story without providing any evidence.
[02:26:46.908 --> 02:26:49.109]  That is a known logical fallacy.
[02:26:50.009 --> 02:26:52.571]  More or less referred to as appeal to authority.
[02:26:52.931 --> 02:26:57.875]  He expects us to take everything on faith because they are the supposed authorities in government.
[02:26:58.415 --> 02:26:59.896]  They will dictate reality.
[02:26:59.936 --> 02:27:04.099]  That's everything Alex is speaking against in the rant we heard in the previous segment.
[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:11.062]  It just goes to show that here's the Atlantic Monthly, the slippery story of Bin Laden killed.
[02:27:11.102 --> 02:27:18.304]  The early narrative of the assault on Osama Bin Laden and him using his wife as a human shield and firing from behind her.
[02:27:18.724 --> 02:27:20.845]  Now we learn he wasn't even armed.
[02:27:21.705 --> 02:27:33.169]  They've got a photo here of kind of a revised script that the White House said Tuesday they blame the fog of war for conflicting statements and recounting of the events of the Abbottabad raid that
[02:27:34.642 --> 02:27:36.343]  In fact, he was never even armed.
[02:27:36.823 --> 02:27:41.345]  And that's if you even believe Osama bin Laden was even still living.
[02:27:41.785 --> 02:27:46.127]  There were reports certainly of his death as early as December 2001.
[02:27:47.127 --> 02:27:49.508]  Even if he wasn't dead, he was a very sick man.
[02:27:49.528 --> 02:27:50.689]  Here's an article in...
[02:27:51.849 --> 02:27:57.794]  From Washington blog, it's on Infowars.com, why didn't we capture the terrorist kingpin and interrogate him?
[02:27:58.755 --> 02:28:00.316]  But we'll get into that point in just a minute.
[02:28:00.596 --> 02:28:06.781]  But it brings up how he not only had the kidney dialysis problem, he very clearly had diabetes.
[02:28:06.841 --> 02:28:09.063]  He could barely move the left side of his body.
[02:28:09.763 --> 02:28:12.425]  Bin Laden had low blood pressure.
[02:28:12.505 --> 02:28:14.247]  He had a wound in his foot.
[02:28:15.168 --> 02:28:23.156]  He was flown to Dubai in an American hospital for treatment for 10 days for his kidney dialysis issues back in 2001-2002.
[02:28:23.176 --> 02:28:24.037]  He's suffering from Hepatitis C.
[02:28:29.485 --> 02:28:37.849]  He may have even had Marfan syndrome, a disorder of the connective tissue that would have given him back problems, heart conditions, the possibility for sudden death.
[02:28:38.909 --> 02:28:47.013]  He may have been an ideological enemy, but this was not a person in any position to fire a weapon or quote-unquote resist.
[02:28:47.153 --> 02:28:54.296]  They put forward the idea that they only killed bin Laden if indeed he was even in this compound because of supposedly resisting.
[02:28:54.956 --> 02:28:57.497]  Then we see that story completely fall apart as a hoax.
[02:28:57.537 --> 02:29:02.779]  He wasn't armed and he would have been a sickly old man if he was even in this compound.
[02:29:02.879 --> 02:29:06.620]  Very unlikely that he would have been able to even wield a weapon.
[02:29:07.481 --> 02:29:10.582]  But moreover, we have this whole false debate that
[02:29:11.582 --> 02:29:13.903]  Obama White House couldn't produce evidence.
[02:29:13.943 --> 02:29:25.108]  There's a complete opposite of a trail of evidence because the photos would be upsetting because they had to bury him at sea according to Muslim cultural norms, which wasn't even true.
[02:29:26.449 --> 02:29:29.590]  Why would they care about upsetting photos when they released Abu Ghraib?
[02:29:30.471 --> 02:29:32.732]  American soldiers have desecrated the Koran.
[02:29:33.352 --> 02:29:36.334]  And they completely disrespected the 9-11 families.
[02:29:36.394 --> 02:29:39.916]  Wouldn't even dig up all the remains and properly bury them.
[02:29:39.976 --> 02:29:41.637]  Instead, sent them to a trash heap.
[02:29:42.057 --> 02:29:43.277]  It's complete hypocrisy.
[02:29:43.297 --> 02:29:44.598]  We'll get more into it.
[02:29:44.758 --> 02:29:47.980]  Alex Jones will also be joining us after this break.
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.201]  I'm Aaron Dykes, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:50.581 --> 02:29:51.502]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.982 --> 02:29:53.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.523 --> 02:29:57.185]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.256 --> 02:30:03.717]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:30:04.077 --> 02:30:08.118]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:30:08.358 --> 02:30:13.140]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:30:13.260 --> 02:30:18.241]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:30:19.002 --> 02:30:26.144]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:30:28.941 --> 02:30:36.170]  We're American and be proud.
[02:30:36.290 --> 02:30:38.673]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:59.375]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:31:00.315 --> 02:31:06.982]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[02:31:07.262 --> 02:31:09.625]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[02:31:09.905 --> 02:31:12.107]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with eFoots Direct.
[02:31:12.347 --> 02:31:16.531]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:18.193]  You must act automatically.
[02:31:18.413 --> 02:31:21.596]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[02:31:21.916 --> 02:31:24.399]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[02:31:24.699 --> 02:31:32.667]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[02:31:33.067 --> 02:31:35.830]  You need a 5-Day Extreme Emergency Kit.
[02:31:36.070 --> 02:31:45.737]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days, this powerful $300 Extreme Emergency Kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.
[02:31:45.757 --> 02:31:47.839]  Go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633.
[02:31:47.859 --> 02:31:50.301]  That's eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[02:31:50.321 --> 02:31:50.361]  800-409-5633.
[02:32:03.951 --> 02:32:04.852]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.192 --> 02:32:08.773]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.074 --> 02:32:11.355]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:11.535 --> 02:32:16.818]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.238 --> 02:32:23.501]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:23.901 --> 02:32:29.464]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:29.884 --> 02:32:33.546]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.046 --> 02:32:38.027]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:32:38.327 --> 02:32:43.848]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:32:44.268 --> 02:32:47.249]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:47.829 --> 02:32:49.229]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:49.809 --> 02:32:50.289]  It's here.

[02:33:32.012 --> 02:33:33.273]  Okay, we are back.
[02:33:33.353 --> 02:33:34.833]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:35.053 --> 02:33:49.619]  I'm Aaron Dyke sitting in, but we have Alex Jones on the line, and we've just been going through what a hoax this is, how it's falling apart, how Obama really is going to have egg on his face in just a few minutes, because this story doesn't add up.
[02:33:49.659 --> 02:33:53.561]  They're completely conflicting, but let's go to Alex and see what he has to say.
[02:33:53.581 --> 02:33:54.301]  Alex, are you there?
[02:33:55.558 --> 02:33:58.219]  Yes, Aaron, it's great to be here with you.
[02:33:58.599 --> 02:34:15.167]  I apologize to listeners that I'm not going to be in today or tomorrow, but we've all joked about the Murphy's Law over the years at the office that a few times a year I take off two or three days to take my children camping or fishing, that there's always a big, giant world event.
[02:34:16.067 --> 02:34:24.191]  But I just want to say how proud I am of the fact that I've got such a wonderful team in Aaron Dykes and Paul Watson and Steve Watson.
[02:34:25.322 --> 02:34:25.963]  We're good to go.
[02:34:44.437 --> 02:35:03.016]  Going out to this cabin to do some fishing and so I'm doing this here from a side of the road at a rest stop and I'll join folks for most of the last hour tomorrow from a landline because obviously there's no rest for those of us that live in reality that live in the real world countering those that are driven to force.
[02:35:03.636 --> 02:35:16.526]  A false reality on us to break our will and train us just to accept surreal levels of government intrusion and propaganda and disinformation designed to be ridiculous.
[02:35:16.906 --> 02:35:26.653]  Because once people buy into a ridiculous lie, now their threshold is higher and higher for what could ever wake them up.
[02:35:27.274 --> 02:35:28.935]  And this is a serious psychological
[02:35:30.091 --> 02:35:32.333]  Warfare tactic that they're engaging in.
[02:35:32.393 --> 02:35:44.041]  Dr. Webster-Tarpley agreed with me yesterday that this is, uh, they're, they're putting out all these little pieces of, okay, uh, we didn't kill a bear and he didn't shoot at us, so he didn't put his wife in front of us.
[02:35:44.121 --> 02:35:47.404]  And, you know, they've got that tinker toy stealth helicopter.
[02:35:47.424 --> 02:35:49.725]  We were sitting around the office saying, what does this look like yesterday?
[02:35:49.745 --> 02:35:54.649]  And I said, it's clearly a stealth helicopter, probably a remote control that flew in there.
[02:35:55.089 --> 02:35:55.870]  We're good to go.
[02:36:12.027 --> 02:36:17.532]  That itself is just a front tinker toy for the real things they've got in the late 1970s.
[02:36:17.852 --> 02:36:20.955]  Dr. Bob Bowman has confirmed this only because it leaped once.
[02:36:21.475 --> 02:36:22.736]  It was highly classified.
[02:36:22.776 --> 02:36:23.717]  He didn't get to talk about it.
[02:36:24.117 --> 02:36:40.611]  There is over, when he was head of Star Wars in the late 70s, when it was still a secret program, there is over, over, 100, and this was again in 1979, stealth robotic space drones with
[02:36:41.503 --> 02:37:11.029]  Sabo DU Meteor gun weapons and basically just takes the meteor system and and similar to a meteor coming in at 30,000 miles an hour by the time it accelerates over accelerates it with boosters over 40,000 miles an hour and is a decapitation weapon it doesn't have a nuclear explosion but the kinetic energy is similar to a low yield has incredible penetration power and can destroy cases one mile under the largest mount so let's understand folks
[02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:26.452]  There's an entire secret military, an entire secret giant system, and as I called it before anybody else did, just because I understand the enemy, the globalistic scientific dictatorship of folks, Kim trailing us every day, giant secret program, now partially declassified, the very same system
[02:37:27.464 --> 02:37:30.488]  Uh, that is putting fluoride in our water for 60 years.
[02:37:30.808 --> 02:37:33.071]  Now, admittedly, the brain damages from reduced fertility.
[02:37:33.331 --> 02:37:35.253]  The same system with GMOs, the crops.
[02:37:35.654 --> 02:37:38.397]  In every case, it has the, quote, side effect of reducing fertility.
[02:37:38.617 --> 02:37:47.888]  There's a giant scientific dictatorship overlaid via the national security state with global standardization.
[02:37:48.448 --> 02:37:49.529]  That is taking place.
[02:37:49.969 --> 02:37:53.432]  Now, continuing, getting into the Bin Laden information.
[02:37:53.472 --> 02:38:00.436]  Ladies and gentlemen, when I came out Sunday night and said it was a spy op, it's because I knew Bin Laden had died at least nine years before.
[02:38:00.757 --> 02:38:04.879]  It was because I've known from top sources they were going to roll him out of the politically expedient time.
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:06.280]  We were on record before.
[02:38:06.781 --> 02:38:07.061]  It was
[02:38:07.907 --> 02:38:16.751]  The way he came out, the way he delivered it, the way that they were already trying to menace Pakistan, hundreds of other points, and then on Monday, we came out.
[02:38:16.791 --> 02:38:22.073]  It's not that we're just saying everything's a conspiracy, or that National Media TV, you name it, asked me.
[02:38:22.293 --> 02:38:24.334]  Well Alex, I mean, you're not alone with the conspiracy.
[02:38:24.374 --> 02:38:24.974]  This is a conspiracy.
[02:38:25.314 --> 02:38:27.455]  This is part of the 9-11 line.
[02:38:27.675 --> 02:38:29.976]  This is part of the clash of civilizations.
[02:38:30.716 --> 02:38:41.901]  This is part of this entire system that's meant to overthrow our classic and basic canons of a free society in the name of them protecting us.
[02:38:41.941 --> 02:38:43.102]  But think about the hoax.
[02:38:43.582 --> 02:38:49.044]  Even if you believe the terror is real, you've got a better chance of dying in a skateboarding accident.
[02:38:49.064 --> 02:38:50.185]  There's hundreds of those a year.
[02:38:50.505 --> 02:38:52.866]  You've got a better chance of dying in sports accidents.
[02:38:53.626 --> 02:39:01.428]  There are more than 50 deaths a year in football at all levels, public school, college, and then up to NFL.
[02:39:01.648 --> 02:39:03.309]  I mean, do we have checkpoints for that?
[02:39:03.329 --> 02:39:07.329]  I noticed right after it happened, they said, see, we're going to take more of your rights now.
[02:39:07.350 --> 02:39:10.590]  You've got to have locally trained people in all your malls.
[02:39:10.650 --> 02:39:18.632]  We already have the TSA PSAs put out three months ago to local police that they're now going to train police and have a TSA manager in the mall.
[02:39:18.692 --> 02:39:21.353]  We have the video of the TSA already in the malls.
[02:39:21.713 --> 02:39:25.195]  They're getting us ready for the total takeover of society.
[02:39:25.575 --> 02:39:27.656]  And so we know it's all part of a larger continuity.
[02:39:27.676 --> 02:39:30.318]  But remember, we came out...
[02:39:31.244 --> 02:39:36.229]  Sunday, and then on Monday, and said that's obviously a stage photo that was Hillary putting her hand over her mouth.
[02:39:36.589 --> 02:39:41.614]  She's had to respond now, saying she just, you know, had allergies or whatever, or was coughing.
[02:39:41.714 --> 02:39:48.581]  But she's obviously, it's all scripted, they all got it to look a certain way, and that's not how those situation rooms work.
[02:39:49.001 --> 02:39:53.065]  And then Dr. Pacinic, who worked in things like that area, said it was fake.
[02:39:53.645 --> 02:39:58.106]  On Tuesday, on Wednesday, now it comes out that it is completely fake.
[02:39:58.126 --> 02:39:59.127]  They've had to admit that.
[02:39:59.787 --> 02:40:01.547]  The entire thing is a lie.
[02:40:01.607 --> 02:40:03.608]  Dumping the body in the ocean, lie.
[02:40:04.348 --> 02:40:05.568]  All of it, lie, lie, lie.
[02:40:05.908 --> 02:40:09.209]  One of his daughters captured at the compound, held by Pakistani intelligence.
[02:40:09.509 --> 02:40:11.570]  They can tell us Mickey Mouse was captured there.
[02:40:11.850 --> 02:40:15.471]  The guy had scores of concubines, at least, what, four or five wives.
[02:40:16.503 --> 02:40:19.829]  The whole family is British, Assad, and U.S.
[02:40:19.889 --> 02:40:24.518]  intelligence on record, triple agents, biggest construction company in the Middle East.
[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:29.084]  It's exclusive contracts in major nations to build U.S.
[02:40:29.145 --> 02:40:36.212]  bases, of major partners, of third biggest owners, Queen of England, George Bush Sr., and then the Bin Laden's, the Carlyle Group.
[02:40:36.733 --> 02:40:41.518]  London Guardian, September 12th, they were meeting at a private Carlyle meeting in D.C.
[02:40:41.839 --> 02:40:42.680]  on September 11th.
[02:40:43.180 --> 02:40:46.284]  On and on and on and on and on.
[02:40:46.744 --> 02:41:10.025]  I mean, folks, why do you think it came out in major news the day after 9-11 that an Air Force base in Nebraska, Berkshire Hathaway head Warren Buffett, the day before, had told everybody they had to be there in a hangar for a secret meeting, and he got the Fortune 100 leaders there in a private meeting to lay down the law to them about what had just happened.
[02:41:10.385 --> 02:41:13.708]  This is a strategic operation where they do something so criminal
[02:41:14.248 --> 02:41:14.948]  So obvious.
[02:41:14.988 --> 02:41:17.650]  They want people that are awake to know it was an inside job.
[02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:19.250]  That's why they blow the buildings up on purpose.
[02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:25.653]  That's why Larry Silverstein tells you he blew up Building 7 so that those that are awake are horrified of these criminals.
[02:41:25.733 --> 02:41:27.194]  It's anti-mafia intimidation.
[02:41:27.454 --> 02:41:28.194]  Hey, we're the mafia.
[02:41:28.234 --> 02:41:28.674]  We'll get you.
[02:41:28.934 --> 02:41:33.456]  But to further condition those they know will buy into the lie.
[02:41:33.536 --> 02:41:37.738]  This is the key to the overall psychological warfare
[02:41:38.849 --> 02:41:38.929]  Yes.
[02:41:53.455 --> 02:42:06.182]  Also, a system so that they can prepare to hype up more fear, introduce the four new leaders of Al-Qaeda, three of which are all born in the U.S., two of which, on record, completely work for U.S.
[02:42:06.242 --> 02:42:09.724]  intelligence, Adam Gadahn and Amr Allalaf, totally admitted.
[02:42:09.744 --> 02:42:12.285]  We've sourced all that.
[02:42:13.125 --> 02:42:19.329]  And it is basically, also, of course, as I said, to menace Pakistan.
[02:42:21.823 --> 02:42:23.966]  Yeah, Alex, we're hearing just a bit of phone noise.
[02:42:24.687 --> 02:42:28.632]  But doesn't the president know he's just a puppet for this false system?
[02:42:29.013 --> 02:42:36.402]  Why do we see him so personally engaged in worrying about what conspiracy theorists will say, claiming the photo's fake?
[02:42:37.123 --> 02:42:41.165]  We've seen the public push back against the TSA, against the 9-11 fable.
[02:42:41.586 --> 02:42:42.666]  People want evidence.
[02:42:42.706 --> 02:42:47.029]  They want justified policy, not these oppressive continuity of agenda.
[02:42:47.129 --> 02:42:54.853]  Why is the president taking this so personally and speaking out against people like you who've been breaking apart this fraud for so long?
[02:42:55.594 --> 02:42:57.074]  Well, Aaron, do I need to reconnect to you?
[02:42:57.094 --> 02:42:58.315]  Because I'm sorry I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[02:42:59.596 --> 02:43:04.979]  I think it sounds a little better, but we just heard a couple of cut-ins and outs, so I would go ahead.
[02:43:07.654 --> 02:43:09.315]  I want everybody to listen to me very, very carefully.
[02:43:10.095 --> 02:43:14.878]  This is a war over truth and a war over reality, as Hillary said, an info war.
[02:43:15.958 --> 02:43:23.702]  They are scripting it to where they say the sky is red, you say it's blue, you're an evil conspiracy theorist and anti-American.
[02:43:24.460 --> 02:43:30.003]  This is about selling people to accept whatever bizarreness they push on us.
[02:43:30.063 --> 02:43:31.404]  It's all about breaking our will.
[02:43:31.764 --> 02:43:33.925]  That's what TSA and the molestation is about.
[02:43:34.286 --> 02:43:35.967]  That's what all the surveillance is about.
[02:43:36.327 --> 02:43:38.668]  That's what trying to kiss a smile on their parents is about.
[02:43:39.028 --> 02:43:40.669]  It's about being over the top.
[02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:44.532]  And what's happening is they've got a 9% approval rating in Congress.
[02:43:45.052 --> 02:43:46.753]  The president has no credibility.
[02:43:46.793 --> 02:43:48.434]  The system is in crisis.
[02:43:49.334 --> 02:44:05.926]  And they are basically floundering because most of the calls I hear to talk radio now have shifted to people really waking up and questioning, and so they are trying to come out and ridicule... Listen, Aaron, how's the phone coming in now?
[02:44:06.386 --> 02:44:07.067]  Yeah, you're fine.
[02:44:07.167 --> 02:44:08.628]  It was just a couple things earlier.
[02:44:09.168 --> 02:44:14.572]  As you know, we left work at 9 o'clock last night, and you and I and all the IT guys went to have dinner.
[02:44:15.012 --> 02:44:17.834]  When I got in the car at 10.30 at night,
[02:44:19.335 --> 02:44:20.596]  I did what I always do.
[02:44:20.696 --> 02:44:25.541]  I surf Dallas, Austin, Houston, San Antonio, Waco radio stations.
[02:44:25.882 --> 02:44:26.642]  Now this happened.
[02:44:28.224 --> 02:44:35.130]  I hit the first button to a local station during a syndicated show of a guy I've never heard of.
[02:44:35.771 --> 02:44:36.612]  Last name Doyle.
[02:44:37.635 --> 02:44:40.298]  Uh, one looked him up, he's a pretty big syndicate, he's got like 150 stations.
[02:44:40.318 --> 02:44:41.779]  He was saying, I have attacked him.
[02:44:42.100 --> 02:44:43.641]  That's why people are listening, it's a sign-off.
[02:44:43.661 --> 02:44:46.264]  I think I deserve to have what's said about me said.
[02:44:46.344 --> 02:44:47.965]  Not to know who the guy was, but I heard him.
[02:44:48.926 --> 02:44:50.428]  Uh, or maybe someone ran a sign-off on him.
[02:44:51.232 --> 02:45:02.974]  They went on and talked about how dangerous and despicable and evil I was, and how we're nuts, and how we, you know, we're putting out distractions from our real problem, Propeller Reserve.
[02:45:03.375 --> 02:45:14.777]  Funny, those guys would talk about Propeller Reserve years ago, but now all the big mainline conservatives do, because we're always pushing the envelope towards reality as the establishment tried to drag it into La La Land.
[02:45:15.417 --> 02:45:20.398]  And it went on and on, and I shouldn't be the talker's keynote person, and he didn't know, and he should boycott it.
[02:45:20.658 --> 02:45:21.319]  Good, I don't care.
[02:45:21.359 --> 02:45:22.219]  I don't even need to go to that.
[02:45:22.239 --> 02:45:24.099]  I hope you guys boycott it and make a big stink out of it.
[02:45:24.119 --> 02:45:25.480]  I don't want to travel to New York.
[02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:30.521]  I mean, I'm happy they invited me and want me to be there, but hey, listen, I don't... It's all about the gatekeeping.
[02:45:30.541 --> 02:45:31.922]  I wanted to shut somebody up.
[02:45:32.362 --> 02:45:33.102]  Shut somebody up.
[02:45:33.122 --> 02:45:35.302]  That's what that guy, that caller in England was saying.
[02:45:35.342 --> 02:45:37.103]  You know, you're spreading A, you need to be shut down.
[02:45:37.883 --> 02:45:39.184]  That's their response to us.
[02:45:39.224 --> 02:45:42.365]  You saw the Pittsburgh Gazette saying, shut up Alex Jones.
[02:45:42.765 --> 02:45:43.425]  That was the headline.
[02:45:43.725 --> 02:45:46.386]  Topper Conspiracy Theorist said, shut up.
[02:45:46.686 --> 02:45:49.167]  Alex Jones is dangerous, shut him up.
[02:45:49.567 --> 02:45:51.628]  Because they can't deal with it.
[02:45:52.028 --> 02:46:00.311]  Everything we talked about four or five days ago, that Sunday night, has now come true, been proven, because we're following the globalist roadmap.
[02:46:00.631 --> 02:46:02.032]  We understand their programs.
[02:46:03.104 --> 02:46:04.586]  I hit the, this is insane.
[02:46:05.066 --> 02:46:07.448]  I listened for about five minutes to this rant going into break.
[02:46:07.809 --> 02:46:11.232]  I think I'm not even going to listen to it because I'm not even into hearing about people talk about me.
[02:46:11.392 --> 02:46:13.174]  I'm all over TV, radio, other shows.
[02:46:13.194 --> 02:46:16.517]  You guys know 90% of the time I don't even go look at it, read it.
[02:46:16.538 --> 02:46:18.920]  I didn't even read the whole Rolling Stone article I was in.
[02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:21.442]  I didn't even read the entire New York Magazine.
[02:46:21.482 --> 02:46:24.505]  I only watched myself on the Nightline once.
[02:46:25.486 --> 02:46:26.007]  I'm not into it.
[02:46:26.027 --> 02:46:26.908]  I'm into information.
[02:46:27.591 --> 02:46:29.853]  But, so I said, I'm not going to listen to any more of this.
[02:46:30.194 --> 02:46:32.096]  I'm going to get some information, see what else is happening.
[02:46:32.116 --> 02:46:33.097]  I want to know the feel.
[02:46:33.517 --> 02:46:34.278]  I hit the button.
[02:46:34.959 --> 02:46:37.121]  I go to a Dallas radio station.
[02:46:37.922 --> 02:46:38.503]  Big show.
[02:46:38.663 --> 02:46:39.604]  They're attacking me.
[02:46:40.755 --> 02:46:50.617]  On the same talking points, Aaron, then I tuned in my 30-minute drive home, through a couple more stations, and heard them saying, who are these crazy conspiracy theorists that don't buy it?
[02:46:50.657 --> 02:46:51.298]  They're bad.
[02:46:51.618 --> 02:46:52.378]  Torture's good.
[02:46:52.418 --> 02:46:53.778]  This proves torture's good.
[02:46:54.078 --> 02:46:55.378]  You know, basically the talking points.
[02:46:55.519 --> 02:47:00.300]  And then I dialed and found another syndicated show attacking me.
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:01.740]  It was insane.
[02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:04.521]  So we have hit such a sight, guys, with the truth.
[02:47:04.901 --> 02:47:10.282]  The globalists are only thinking they can get away with more, more, more, killing Kennedy in broad daylight, blowing up the towers in front
[02:47:10.382 --> 02:47:10.662]  I don't
[02:47:27.461 --> 02:47:31.342]  Attack Dogs coming after InfoWars.com and Prison Planet.
[02:47:31.362 --> 02:47:56.688]  This is so big, I probably should be able to left town, but you guys are doing just a fabulous job, but I mean, I can't believe I'm in the middle of history like this, and all my listeners are, that we literally are carrying the banner of truth, of real investigation, of real facts, of trying to understand the truth, trying to be honorable, trying to really do the research, and we're just proving it right over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, and the system is in
[02:47:57.128 --> 02:47:58.529]  Total panic.
[02:47:58.989 --> 02:48:06.572]  And that's why everywhere, the left, the right, the entire establishment is showing themselves because they need this new 9-11.
[02:48:06.652 --> 02:48:08.053]  And this is the final point.
[02:48:08.453 --> 02:48:09.713]  Because they are gauging.
[02:48:09.753 --> 02:48:10.994]  This is all a trial balloon.
[02:48:11.741 --> 02:48:18.346]  For a war on Pakistan, that's geopolitical from the international perspective, foreign policy.
[02:48:18.927 --> 02:48:28.134]  But they're also looking at the false flag in the middle of this depression and rising gas prices and plunging stock markets and exploding commodities.
[02:48:28.734 --> 02:48:35.559]  They are looking so the American people don't get mad and have a peaceful revolution, a restoration of the republic.
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:39.582]  At this key point is to predict that they want wars and domestic terror.
[02:48:40.063 --> 02:48:41.264]  And we, all of us,
[02:48:42.068 --> 02:48:42.488]  We're good to go.
[02:49:00.259 --> 02:49:02.201]  But they can't stop these ideas.
[02:49:02.741 --> 02:49:08.345]  And as the great French philosopher Victor Hugo said, no army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[02:49:08.666 --> 02:49:12.429]  Or as V for Vendetta, the statement from V, ideas are bulletproof.
[02:49:12.589 --> 02:49:14.850]  I'm just made out of flesh and blood, bleeding to death.
[02:49:15.091 --> 02:49:16.292]  The farmer gets the bad guys.
[02:49:16.432 --> 02:49:19.114]  But ideas, ideas are bulletproof.
[02:49:19.414 --> 02:49:20.215]  And that's the message.
[02:49:20.235 --> 02:49:20.735]  You've got to go 110%
[02:49:22.176 --> 02:49:24.137]  We are making history on the side of good.
[02:49:24.157 --> 02:49:33.542]  If we beat these people, our ancestors will literally use us as an example to fight the tyranny of their day because there's always evil people struggling against good.
[02:49:33.562 --> 02:49:36.143]  The globalists are in full rout.
[02:49:36.163 --> 02:49:37.784]  This is completely blown up in their face.
[02:49:38.224 --> 02:49:46.049]  We are witnessing absolute, total history unfold, Aaron, and it is just so good to be alive, and I'm so blessed.
[02:49:46.129 --> 02:49:47.509]  If I died today, I don't want to.
[02:49:47.549 --> 02:49:48.850]  I love life so much.
[02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:51.151]  The only thing I love more than life is my children and God.
[02:49:51.552 --> 02:49:56.314]  But I'm here to tell you, if I died today, I died fulfilled, knowing I did the right thing.
[02:49:56.354 --> 02:49:57.555]  I stood up for what was right.
[02:49:57.875 --> 02:49:59.136]  I didn't buy the propaganda.
[02:49:59.756 --> 02:50:00.036]  We're good.
[02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:20.991]  We're good to go.
[02:50:36.185 --> 02:50:37.246]  We're good to go.
[02:50:51.198 --> 02:50:52.699]  Okay, Alex, we're going to break.
[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:56.003]  We'll come back with those comments and the song.
[02:50:56.023 --> 02:50:57.104]  You're absolutely right.
[02:50:57.504 --> 02:50:59.126]  We're fighting for the reality.
[02:50:59.586 --> 02:51:00.547]  They're fighting for lies.
[02:51:00.607 --> 02:51:01.027]  We'll be back.
[02:51:01.047 --> 02:51:02.949]  Spring and a new growing season are here.
[02:51:03.209 --> 02:51:07.053]  Plant a healthy garden easy and fast with OrganicaSeed.com.
[02:51:07.293 --> 02:51:14.360]  Easy because OrganicaSeed.com offers one of the largest online selections of organic, heirloom, non-hybrid, and untreated seeds.

[02:51:30.254 --> 02:51:31.315]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:51:31.495 --> 02:51:35.878]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:51:36.058 --> 02:51:41.762]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:51:41.862 --> 02:51:45.284]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:51:45.504 --> 02:51:48.106]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:51:48.226 --> 02:51:53.149]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.

[02:51:53.530 --> 02:51:54.931]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:52:02.996 --> 02:52:04.938]  Alex Jones here with key information.
[02:52:05.318 --> 02:52:05.819]  The U.S.
[02:52:05.899 --> 02:52:12.624]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks.
[02:52:13.165 --> 02:52:15.807]  With Japan about to become a seller of U.S.
[02:52:15.887 --> 02:52:19.150]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation, and the U.S.
[02:52:19.230 --> 02:52:25.815]  antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators, the Federal Reserve, which is already buying about 70% of U.S.
[02:52:25.875 --> 02:52:28.477]  Treasuries, will soon be the only buyer left of U.S.
[02:52:28.517 --> 02:52:28.978]  Treasuries.
[02:52:29.378 --> 02:52:32.840]  Our friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the U.S.
[02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:38.462]  dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes and savings destroyed.
[02:52:38.822 --> 02:52:46.806]  I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us.
[02:52:47.286 --> 02:52:56.650]  If you are sick and tired of the economic propaganda in the mainstream media, sign up for free at inflation.us to learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores.
[02:52:59.494 --> 02:53:01.796]  Big Berkey water filters are in high demand.
[02:53:02.016 --> 02:53:03.857]  Storable foods are also in high demand.

[02:53:09.120 --> 02:53:12.543]  But increasingly, our customers have been asking for storable foods.

[02:54:13.905 --> 02:54:17.448]  Okay, we are back, but we want to let this song roll for just a minute.
[02:54:17.468 --> 02:54:18.769]  I don't have the name in front of me.
[02:54:20.050 --> 02:54:21.350]  Alex was, oh, it's a different.
[02:54:22.171 --> 02:54:23.612]  Okay, we got the wrong cue over there.
[02:54:23.632 --> 02:54:26.234]  We're going to try to play that song Alex was talking about tomorrow.
[02:54:26.634 --> 02:54:28.296]  But Alex is absolutely right.
[02:54:28.396 --> 02:54:30.737]  We're in a fight for the truth.
[02:54:31.338 --> 02:54:34.300]  And we have the system who's just perpetuated by lies.
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:36.882]  And we're in this battle over the truth.
[02:54:37.222 --> 02:54:58.514]  We're fighting against literally the 1984 system of total deception on purpose, reverting the truth, spinning lies to become even deeper lies, fighting against a literal Emanuel Goldstein bin Laden myth, a guy they had on the shelf to roll out at any time, and now they've done so at a politically expedient moment.
[02:54:59.155 --> 02:55:04.138]  Even though their story's falling apart, you see everyone attacking Alex Jones and the others who've really been
[02:55:04.958 --> 02:55:08.561]  Pointing out that the emperor is naked all along for all these years.
[02:55:09.342 --> 02:55:12.905]  But of course, it's distracting from so much other important news.
[02:55:12.945 --> 02:55:14.006]  The falling economy.
[02:55:14.446 --> 02:55:22.533]  Gerald Salente wrote an interesting article today called, Bigger Than Bin Laden, America's New Public Enemy Number One.
[02:55:22.614 --> 02:55:27.598]  Trying to put focus on Bernanke at the Fed and their very destructive policy.
[02:55:27.638 --> 02:55:30.621]  Far more destructive than 9-11 or Bin Laden could have been.
[02:55:31.622 --> 02:55:40.460]  While Obama grandstands, we have his allies like Bill Richardson saying killing Bin Laden means Obama can pass a climate bill.
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:56:09.142]  Even deeper in the news today we have the Obama administration trying to put a tax on cars by the mile using an implanted electronic device in the car they say but then they spend that too and say actually this is not a policy but it'll be implemented after a two-year study but it's not a policy of the president or his administration but they will be putting trackers in your car for an even greater tax really restricting freedom of travel
[02:56:09.662 --> 02:56:12.165]  Even more than any gas or highway tax could.
[02:56:13.346 --> 02:56:14.367]  We have Obama.
[02:56:16.172 --> 02:56:20.433]  We have the FDA, rather, claiming they can seize food without evidence of contamination.
[02:56:20.513 --> 02:56:20.874]  Why not?
[02:56:20.914 --> 02:56:24.315]  They don't have to offer proof of Osama Bin Laden's death.
[02:56:24.695 --> 02:56:28.256]  The president's very bitter at having to prove his birth certificate.
[02:56:28.696 --> 02:56:30.237]  Really seemed like a personal battle.
[02:56:30.797 --> 02:56:32.237]  There's so much more to get into.
[02:56:32.337 --> 02:56:40.280]  Prince Charles telling America it needs to cut down on steaks for the sake of the world after his family just had one of the most lavish weddings ever.
[02:56:40.980 --> 02:56:43.724]  Uh, in history, and we have shocking stuff.
[02:56:43.764 --> 02:56:50.372]  The falling apart of American society, Detroit, uh, nearly half of, uh, their people, 40 percent, excuse me.
[02:56:54.579 --> 02:56:57.100]  47% of Detroiters are functionally illiterate.
[02:56:57.260 --> 02:57:01.022]  I'm not reading too well myself, but it's just devastating statistics.
[02:57:01.522 --> 02:57:06.025]  Everything that's being distracted by this big Obama-bin Laden lie.
[02:57:06.285 --> 02:57:08.586]  But we must fight back against this system.
[02:57:09.226 --> 02:57:12.307]  We will win the info war, and they can't hide the truth.
[02:57:12.888 --> 02:57:13.968]  We meant to get to calls.
[02:57:14.068 --> 02:57:15.369]  We'll have to get to them tomorrow.
[02:57:15.549 --> 02:57:16.849]  Alex will be back on.
[02:57:17.210 --> 02:57:21.532]  We'll hear even more from Alex on these just incredible unfolding events.
[02:57:22.412 --> 02:57:23.633]  Where will they go from here?
[02:57:23.973 --> 02:57:25.815]  How will they expand the war on terror?
[02:57:26.655 --> 02:57:28.717]  Will there be a ground force in Libya?
[02:57:29.318 --> 02:57:32.180]  A full-fledged war in Libya?
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:38.465]  And we really hope World War III will not be the result of all this, but in some ways we see
[02:57:38.985 --> 02:57:39.645]  Pointing to that.
[02:57:39.786 --> 02:57:44.668]  And of course we have security expanding because now soft targets have to be guarded.
[02:57:45.129 --> 02:57:49.551]  Now checkpoints may be the norm at everywhere including grocery stores, malls.
[02:57:50.011 --> 02:57:50.632]  But we know this.
[02:57:50.672 --> 02:57:54.714]  This has already been rolled out by TSA since before the Bin Laden era.
[02:57:55.174 --> 02:57:59.297]  We will get deeper into all these subjects and the rest of the news tomorrow.
[02:58:00.557 --> 02:58:02.518]  Right now, we're headed out.
[02:58:02.638 --> 02:58:17.807]  So, on the rebroadcast, Paul Joseph Watson, an incredible interview with Dr. Steve Pichesnik, former administration official, counterterrorism expert, really just laying down the gauntlet on the phony Bin Laden story.
[02:58:18.247 --> 02:58:23.229]  Paul Craig Roberts, Steve Watson, and Alex Jones, all coming up in the rebroadcast.
[02:58:23.330 --> 02:58:26.931]  I'm Aaron Dykes, and this is InfoWars.com.
[02:58:27.332 --> 02:58:27.552]  Thank you.

[02:58:51.613 --> 02:58:53.113]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:53.333 --> 02:58:58.376]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:58:58.636 --> 02:58:59.997]  Saving means to make money.
[02:59:00.177 --> 02:59:06.220]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple
