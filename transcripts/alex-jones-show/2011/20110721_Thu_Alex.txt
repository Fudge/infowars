[00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:04.753]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:06.475]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:08.457]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:09.778]  You want answers?
[00:00:10.558 --> 00:00:11.499]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:20.367]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.430]  We are live.
[00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.952]  It is Thursday, the 21st day of July 2011.
[00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:40.093]  We're going to be here live for at least the next three hours.
[00:00:40.174 --> 00:00:40.974]  We have a couple of
[00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:52.319]  Well-known comedians, one of them, of course, a frequent guest on national television programs, joining us, who are Obama supporters, coming up in the third hour.
[00:00:52.419 --> 00:01:00.143]  So I'm going to have an interesting discussion with both of them here on air and ask them some common sense questions.
[00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:02.264]  It should be quite informative.
[00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:05.825]  We'll see how it goes with Hal Sparks and Richard Hunter.
[00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:11.028]  I've been a frequent guest on Richard Hunter's Dallas television, excuse me, radio broadcast.
[00:01:11.866 --> 00:01:22.446]  Okay, that said, I feel like I should have bells and whistles going off, or like the Drugs Report, a big red siren going for this news that is coming up.
[00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:23.828]  And this news is so big.
[00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:28.224]  That I cannot just start the broadcast with it.
[00:01:28.885 --> 00:01:41.293]  I have to build it up because I've noticed over the years that if I come out with a bombshell info and just blurt it out up front that it doesn't get the attention and the traction it deserves.
[00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:53.402]  This latest Homeland Security activity should be as big as the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that law enforcement now sent us two years ago
[00:01:54.844 --> 00:02:06.330]  Where they admit that 90 plus percent of their training and preparation is for gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans, white people, Ron Paul supporters, people that want to get us out of the UN and in the Fed.
[00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:11.053]  This new video is in an article Paul Watson has written.
[00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:16.016]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:23.120]  Big Sis fear campaign continues, but Americans are just as likely to be killed by peanut allergies than they are in a terrorist attack.
[00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.824]  And that's even averaging the deaths of 9-11 into the equation in the last 10 years.
[00:02:27.844 --> 00:02:42.860]  We're going to be going over this and playing much of the nine-minute propaganda video of the See Something Say Something campaign they're putting on television and on telescreens at Walmarts, Mall of America, and other places where people congregate, the modern town squares.
[00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.548]  The Modern Commons.
[00:02:47.388 --> 00:02:48.648]  This is off the charts.
[00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:58.952]  It shows people's blue eyes and zooms in on them and animates the blue eyes flashing over and over again and has black people and other minorities reporting on the whites.
[00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:03.373]  I mean, it is a hundred percent designed to shift.
[00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:09.055]  See, first they sell you on tyranny that it's only for a group that's overall unpopular.
[00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.736]  Quote, Muslims, Muslim extremists.
[00:03:11.776 --> 00:03:13.437]  And Hitler did that with the Jews.
[00:03:14.077 --> 00:03:23.902]  And then once that's in place, and the police state's in place in the name of going after them, communists, stuff like that, then it's always shifted against the main target, and that's the general public.
[00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:26.804]  And whites, of course, on average, are the most wealthy.
[00:03:27.404 --> 00:03:31.185]  And are still, though not for long, the majority of the aging population.
[00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:36.687]  And it just flashes white person after white person and says they're going to get you, they're coming.
[00:03:37.028 --> 00:03:43.830]  And it shows the minority scrambling, calling Homeland Security, who then sends the good white police to stop evil whitey.
[00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.511]  So it's a classic divide and conquer.
[00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:48.672]  So first they sell the good old boys on...
[00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:57.391]  Hey, we're taking everybody's rights and naked body scanning and looking at your bank account and tapping your phone to get the evil Arabs and Muslims.
[00:03:58.172 --> 00:03:59.613]  Quote, evil Arabs and Muslims.
[00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:11.626]  And then the entire time it was always about landowners, gun owners, pro-lifers, and so now they're publicly rolling out what we've been telling you for a decade was going to be white Al Qaeda.
[00:04:12.722 --> 00:04:14.324]  We're approaching a decade in September.
[00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:33.744]  That it would then be flipped, because we had the internal documents sent to us by police over the years, that it would then be flipped once the grid was in place and say, look, white people, they got blue eyes, and it shows the blue eyes animated and flashing and burning, uh, in Muslim headdress, that white Al-Qaeda is everywhere and the white people are with bin Laden.
[00:04:34.324 --> 00:04:36.645]  And those that want to get out of the UN are with Bin Laden.
[00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:39.126]  And those that don't want to raise the debt ceiling are with Bin Laden.
[00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.967]  And those that don't like Obama are with Bin Laden.
[00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:44.188]  And they're just, they're everywhere.
[00:04:44.568 --> 00:04:45.048]  White people.
[00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:46.889]  They're incredibly evil.
[00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:48.330]  They're incredibly dangerous.
[00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.370]  They're incredibly horrible.
[00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.411]  And they've got to be stopped immediately.
[00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:53.332]  We're going to get into that news coming up.
[00:04:53.412 --> 00:04:58.154]  And then first, in the first two big segments, I'm covered in all the other news.
[00:04:58.614 --> 00:04:58.954]  Okay?
[00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:04.544]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:04.884 --> 00:05:08.405]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:11.026]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:16.487]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:16.907 --> 00:05:23.188]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:29.129]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:33.250]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.711]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.011 --> 00:05:43.532]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:43.972 --> 00:05:46.913]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.933]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:49.993]  It's here.

[00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.291]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:52.514]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:54.415]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:09.827 --> 00:07:15.010]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.992]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:20.354]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:20.574 --> 00:07:26.497]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:30.020]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:35.723]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:35.983 --> 00:07:37.304]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:37.624 --> 00:07:38.765]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:41.447]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:41.587 --> 00:07:45.630]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.294]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:07:50.434 --> 00:07:52.876]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[00:08:00.973 --> 00:08:06.998]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:07.618 --> 00:08:10.601]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:24.711]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:31.495]  We have some in-studio guests, but first I want to direct you, if you're a radio listener, to our top story today.
[00:08:32.075 --> 00:08:34.337]  It's up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:35.557]  It was the top story.
[00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:38.559]  It's now moved to the second story in the right-hand column.
[00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.881]  DHS training video.
[00:08:41.821 --> 00:08:47.703]  White middle class Americans are the number one terror threat.
[00:08:48.283 --> 00:08:50.964]  It's also the top story at Infowars.com.
[00:08:51.024 --> 00:08:52.665]  It's an Infowars.com story.
[00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:56.706]  DHS video characterizes white Americans
[00:08:57.526 --> 00:08:59.346]  as most likely terrorist.
[00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:10.609]  That is coming up in a detailed report and analysis of their brainwashing program and exactly what they're attempting to do with the Divide and Conquer system at the bottom of the hour 33 after.
[00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:19.611]  Going back to Drudge, we're also going to cover another story that is there, and that is America's era in space ends.
[00:09:19.751 --> 00:09:21.111]  That is what NASA is telling us.
[00:09:21.611 --> 00:09:24.772]  Now we've got to go to the UN, the International Space Station, the Russians,
[00:09:25.572 --> 00:09:33.317]  Home at last, Atlantis makes historic final landing as a 30-year shuttle program comes to a glorious end.
[00:09:33.998 --> 00:09:51.030]  And I have a whole stack of de-industrialization post-technological reports how it is the stated design that the West be de-industrialized and only private corporate technological reservations be allowed to develop high-tech systems.
[00:09:52.534 --> 00:09:54.355]  It's all part of the economic development zones.
[00:09:54.395 --> 00:09:55.775]  It's all part of the inland ports.
[00:09:56.476 --> 00:10:00.497]  It's all part of the university slash corporate systems with Google and others.
[00:10:00.517 --> 00:10:05.839]  We're going to break down this key area coming up today as well.
[00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:09.781]  But first, I want to get into all of the other news.
[00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:11.201]  Let me just do this.
[00:10:11.621 --> 00:10:15.303]  I'm going to just read you the headlines of the top seven stacks I have here.
[00:10:15.803 --> 00:10:19.104]  Florida makes $63 million selling driver's license info.
[00:10:19.745 --> 00:10:20.365]  It's illegal.
[00:10:21.786 --> 00:10:22.527]  But they're doing it.
[00:10:25.209 --> 00:10:25.689]  Lawyer.
[00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:27.671]  Cop scanners cross the line.
[00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:30.173]  Police tracking everyone in real time.
[00:10:32.856 --> 00:10:33.536]  Boston Herald.
[00:10:33.576 --> 00:10:34.077]  Here's another.

[00:10:34.657 --> 00:10:38.881]  Police to begin iPhone iris scans amid privacy concerns without warrants.

[00:10:49.617 --> 00:10:51.847]  And they have put out...
[00:10:52.876 --> 00:10:59.298]  On the city of Austin's website, the top ten water wasters giving citizens names.
[00:11:00.099 --> 00:11:03.740]  It's like they publish all over the country in newspapers, but cities also do it.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.941]  The names of concealed weapon holders.
[00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:08.422]  It's part of a form of harassment.
[00:11:08.882 --> 00:11:09.822]  Absolutely criminal.
[00:11:09.862 --> 00:11:19.806]  This is what government does with the data they have on you, violating the Privacy Act, the different acts that protect citizens' information.
[00:11:20.586 --> 00:11:25.230]  You're not supposed to use social security for ID number under federal law, but then the feds demand it.
[00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:28.672]  It's all part of just the open criminality where they are above their own laws.
[00:11:29.213 --> 00:11:33.896]  Also, Pentagon looks to social media as new battlefield.
[00:11:34.196 --> 00:11:40.281]  French news agency, we told you this four years ago, now it's admitted they're taking over the entire web with the internet kill switch takeover system.

[00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:06.088]  On the economic front here today, I'm gonna go back through all this in more detail.
[00:12:07.188 --> 00:12:14.752]  Obama U-turns as he accepts extension of debt limit for a few days if a broader deal is in place.
[00:12:15.947 --> 00:12:17.449]  I thought the world would end if we didn't do that.
[00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:18.490]  Bloomberg.
[00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.911]  U.S.
[00:12:18.951 --> 00:12:21.994]  consumers relying on credit for basic needs.
[00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.778]  The debtor nation wants the greatest creditor nation.
[00:12:24.798 --> 00:12:31.026]  The greatest debtor nation gets deeper into banker bondage to the fiat money that we give them in banker bailouts.
[00:12:31.666 --> 00:12:33.088]  Which aren't bailouts, they're takeovers.
[00:12:34.136 --> 00:12:37.219]  Jobless claims rise above expectations.
[00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:39.981]  Reuters, that's even with cooked federal numbers.
[00:12:40.321 --> 00:12:47.247]  We are three years into a depression by every mainline economic barometer.
[00:12:48.488 --> 00:12:54.593]  But they tell you we left the recession two years and two months ago, in June of 2009.
[00:12:56.254 --> 00:13:00.558]  Continuing, unemployment benefits rise as job growth falters.

[00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:11.278]  Taking homes they don't even have deeds for and never owned any part of.

[00:13:13.418 --> 00:13:13.758]  Why not?
[00:13:13.798 --> 00:13:21.200]  They started 12 years ago taking all of the death benefits of World War II vets through current vets when you die of cancer in a car wreck or in combat.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.121]  And they get you to sign on to take part of your money out for life insurance.
[00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:25.701]  They steal it.
[00:13:26.001 --> 00:13:29.001]  The deal was signed 12 years ago with the big insurance companies in secret.
[00:13:29.481 --> 00:13:30.802]  Declassified last year.
[00:13:30.882 --> 00:13:31.862]  Bloomberg reported on it.
[00:13:32.262 --> 00:13:33.143]  No one got in trouble.
[00:13:33.243 --> 00:13:36.165]  They signed with the federal government to be allowed to steal all your money.
[00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:43.050]  But they say you've got to cry when they put Tribs on TV at a sports game and support the Tribs by feeding them into a meat grinder.
[00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:44.670]  Continuing.
[00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.712]  See, I'm unpatriotic because I want the troops to get their money that they paid into.
[00:13:48.732 --> 00:13:49.773]  Because I'm evil.
[00:13:50.213 --> 00:13:50.773]  Continuing.
[00:13:51.033 --> 00:13:57.256]  I should just flag, fly an American flag out front of the office and made in China and then flush the troops down the toilet.
[00:13:57.556 --> 00:13:59.757]  Then I would be praised as pro-military.
[00:14:00.637 --> 00:14:04.119]  See, it's all about form and packaging over reality.
[00:14:05.103 --> 00:14:11.007]  They put a load of horse manure in a box and then put on the outside of it that it's chocolate cake.
[00:14:11.047 --> 00:14:12.127]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's not.
[00:14:12.427 --> 00:14:13.748]  It doesn't pass the smell test.
[00:14:14.148 --> 00:14:19.131]  Continuing, deficits and stimulus only delay the inevitable economic collapse.
[00:14:19.171 --> 00:14:22.633]  Detailed analysis, Bob Chapman at Infowars.com.
[00:14:23.094 --> 00:14:25.355]  Continuing, Fed preparing for U.S.
[00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:26.336]  default says...
[00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:30.858]  Plosser, top economic analyst in Reuters.
[00:14:31.718 --> 00:14:43.363]  Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser said the Fed has, for the past few months, been working closely with the Treasury, ironing out what to do if the world's biggest economy runs out of cash and defaults.
[00:14:44.463 --> 00:14:45.544]  That's always been their job.
[00:14:46.084 --> 00:14:50.046]  Milka squeezes, getting as deep a debt as they can through fraud.
[00:14:51.283 --> 00:14:52.723]  Over 90% of it, not our debt.
[00:14:53.103 --> 00:14:54.024]  International Bank's debt.
[00:14:54.644 --> 00:15:01.225]  And then they have, the politicians have us sign on to their debt, and then we give them the tens of trillions, and then we pay interest on the money we gave them.
[00:15:01.905 --> 00:15:04.586]  That's fractional reserve banking in the endgame.
[00:15:05.566 --> 00:15:10.847]  Also, New York Times reporter promotes eugenics and, quote, death panels amid budget crisis.
[00:15:11.227 --> 00:15:13.548]  Now they're out in the open saying, yes, they're death panels.
[00:15:13.608 --> 00:15:14.288]  Yes, they're good.
[00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:16.509]  You'll keep your jobs if we kill grandma.
[00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:17.289]  What did
[00:15:19.827 --> 00:15:24.109]  Bill Gates say in speeches last year, we've played the different speeches, he said, yeah, they're death panels.
[00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:28.610]  We don't take care of Grandma, and we let her die, and we get 10 teachers.
[00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.370]  They're selling, and people are clapping.
[00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.190]  Oh, yes!
[00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.631]  You know, the idea that somebody's got to lose for you to win.
[00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:37.731]  That's a cannibalistic, imploding economy.
[00:15:38.291 --> 00:15:41.472]  The globalist main job is putting the brakes on a global economy.
[00:15:41.492 --> 00:15:42.312]  They want you dependent.
[00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:50.533]  The truth is, with mechanization, machines, factories, robotics, technologies, we should all be living like kings.
[00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:52.294]  But they don't want that.
[00:15:52.314 --> 00:15:53.894]  They want a post-industrial world.
[00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.811]  In their own statements.
[00:15:56.531 --> 00:15:57.792]  NASA, the Pentagon.
[00:15:59.153 --> 00:16:10.342]  And oh, and then they respond to the economic degradation they've created with a, quote, green UN army to occupy countries that are imploding under IMF World Bank austerity.
[00:16:10.362 --> 00:16:12.804]  In fact, I never covered that yesterday, crew.
[00:16:13.124 --> 00:16:14.705]  Will you go into yesterday's stack and pull them in?
[00:16:14.725 --> 00:16:18.828]  There's like three articles about the green helmets and
[00:16:20.289 --> 00:16:43.163]  The carbon taxes you don't pay your carbon taxes or do what they say the UN quote green helmets invade, but it's not war It's peace kind of like when Obama backs all these al-qaeda rebels all over the world to overthrow or try to overthrow governments and then openly say well this is good al-qaeda and It's peace when when our rebels attack and then if they're losing then the the NATO and the US start bombing It's not war.
[00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:43.963]  It's kinetic action.
[00:16:44.004 --> 00:16:48.906]  It's peace, so I'm gonna get into all of that continuing here
[00:16:49.907 --> 00:16:51.732]  With other economic news, the stack is thick.
[00:16:51.752 --> 00:16:53.937]  I'll get to more of that later.
[00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.164]  Now remember, coming up at 33 After, The Big Story.
[00:16:59.278 --> 00:17:04.560]  They've got DHS ads that show black people and Hispanics and others seeing white people.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:11.702]  All the terrorists are white and it zooms in on big blue eyes, animated, glowing like glacial ice.
[00:17:12.463 --> 00:17:13.843]  And it's just the whites are everywhere.
[00:17:13.883 --> 00:17:14.683]  The whites are everywhere.
[00:17:14.703 --> 00:17:15.364]  They're going to get you.
[00:17:15.744 --> 00:17:18.044]  You know, the white Al Qaeda.
[00:17:18.565 --> 00:17:22.466]  See, first they tell the good old boys, we're going to take all the rights away of the brown people.
[00:17:22.486 --> 00:17:25.127]  And the good old boys are like, good, get them brown people, kill them.
[00:17:25.407 --> 00:17:26.468]  Glass parking lot them.
[00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:27.808]  We get all the internal documents.
[00:17:27.868 --> 00:17:30.170]  It's all about gun owners, conservatives, returning veterans.
[00:17:31.871 --> 00:17:35.633]  Then, after they've got the stuff in place, they flip it and say, it's white people.
[00:17:35.673 --> 00:17:36.353]  They're everywhere.
[00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:40.055]  Now that's already in the internal police training manuals.
[00:17:42.376 --> 00:17:45.638]  But that's coming up at 33 after.
[00:17:45.998 --> 00:17:49.240]  Okay, continuing with economic news.
[00:17:50.601 --> 00:17:54.563]  Euro reaches 11th hour as Angela Merkel
[00:17:56.272 --> 00:18:00.453]  And Nicholas Sarkozy hold crisis talks.
[00:18:02.294 --> 00:18:04.134]  And you notice how this works.
[00:18:04.394 --> 00:18:07.875]  Europe has now had three bailouts of the banks in the last three years.
[00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:22.499]  The United States has had an open window of just perpetual, quote, bailouts, 70 plus percent of the money we now know going to foreign banks and families and individuals, Rothschilds, Rockefellers, their foreign subsidiaries, tax-free.
[00:18:23.459 --> 00:18:30.764]  While their own media groups promote fixing things by raising taxes on the rich, they mean your neighbor that lives in a bigger house than you, they are exempt.
[00:18:30.784 --> 00:18:38.830]  The ultra-rich are exempt, they sick the giant welfare-dependent class on what's left of the middle class, then everyone's poor and there's no way to escape the bondage.
[00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:46.235]  And then the government jobs or contracts are all you can get because you're post-industrial and your economy's been destroyed and you're totally dependent.
[00:18:46.475 --> 00:18:50.078]  It's a sharecropper, neo-feudalistic, fascistic system.
[00:18:51.348 --> 00:18:52.610]  Every one of those words means something.
[00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:55.335]  When I say a sharecropper economy, look up what that means.
[00:18:55.896 --> 00:18:56.697]  Where you're dependent.
[00:18:56.997 --> 00:18:58.299]  Where you're worse than a slave.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:05.671]  Because slave owners, if you study the Caribbean, you study North America and the colonies, then after in slavery, predominantly blacks.
[00:19:06.994 --> 00:19:21.569]  If you study slavery, you very, very quickly learn that the slaves, the black slaves had it horrible, but the white indentured servants, Irish and others, they were the first waves of quote, poor Europeans.
[00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.113]  Most of you have ancestors that were indentured servants.
[00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:29.837]  You would sign a five, seven or ten year contract and you would
[00:19:31.328 --> 00:19:31.628]  Come on!
[00:19:53.477 --> 00:19:56.822]  And that's what people don't understand.
[00:19:57.583 --> 00:20:05.212]  And the sharecropper owners... HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping.
[00:20:05.512 --> 00:20:09.277]  Our product line has grown from 5 to nearly 100 items in less than 5 years.

[00:20:38.018 --> 00:20:38.759]  This capitalism?
[00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:44.963]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:45.904]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[00:23:54.662 --> 00:23:54.702]  800-332-6784.
[00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:26.689]  So my point on sharecropping is, and this was written in Mainline Histories at the time, that the white sharecroppers a lot of times would starve to death.
[00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:42.301]  And the way it would be put down in the books by the sharecropper owner would be, oh, they die out of sickness because you would get malnourished and then die of a normal cold that wouldn't kill somebody who was getting enough nourishment because you didn't need to take care of them.
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:50.547]  And you would have to buy your products from the company store under the contract, if you wanted a shirt or a dress for your daughter.
[00:24:51.048 --> 00:24:55.112]  And then your children would grow up slaves of the sharecropper system.
[00:24:55.152 --> 00:25:01.799]  Now, when blacks got emancipation proclamation, they then became sharecroppers, most of them.
[00:25:04.031 --> 00:25:25.348]  And then a lot of black folks ran to the north and other areas where they found just as much tribalism, racism, whatever you want to call it, competing for resources, and then tried to form their own communities just so they could have, that's why folks tend to put themselves in their own community, just so they could have some type of economic ecosystem to buy, sell, and trade with each other.
[00:25:26.369 --> 00:25:28.692]  And I'm not saying that segregation was good.
[00:25:29.312 --> 00:25:39.203]  The point is, is that then they wanted to get rid of the thriving wealthy black communities that had developed with their own economies, their own banks, their own grocery stores, their own churches.
[00:25:39.743 --> 00:25:48.432]  And so the Great Society came in as a way to have the state come in, pose as liberals, bring in money to pay the women not to have men in the house.
[00:25:49.213 --> 00:25:56.677]  So that the society would break down, so the narcotics could be brought in, so then the young black males could be put in prison, which were colleges for crime.
[00:25:58.398 --> 00:26:01.099]  And now that same model is being duplicated out to everyone.
[00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:18.568]  So that's why they want to destroy the middle class and make us modern sharecroppers, where we all either get government contracts for business, or are on some type of assistance or welfare, or they take part of your paycheck for life, steal the money, and then hyperinflate the currency and steal the value of your Social Security.
[00:26:20.785 --> 00:26:23.366]  And your pensions, whether they're public or private.
[00:26:23.706 --> 00:26:25.307]  This is how the globalists operate.
[00:26:25.327 --> 00:26:27.548]  They do not want you to be independent.
[00:26:28.668 --> 00:26:37.392]  And sure enough, the third round ended a few months ago of trillions of dollars of European taxpayer money being pumped into private banks and private families.
[00:26:38.092 --> 00:26:45.035]  And so just as soon as they got hundreds of millions more and the Greece bailout, now they're back for more and the contagion is spreading.
[00:26:45.115 --> 00:26:45.375]  Oops!
[00:26:46.275 --> 00:26:49.357]  Now more countries need to be bailed out, but it's not really countries.
[00:26:49.377 --> 00:26:50.838]  They always want to put the blame on the people.
[00:26:51.138 --> 00:26:52.499]  It's not Italy, it's not Portugal.
[00:26:52.799 --> 00:27:05.567]  Their government traders signed on to the derivatives, so the government investments now have been devalued, and so the bankers that sold them the fraudulent instruments don't go to jail, they get trillions more to prop up those very instruments.
[00:27:07.409 --> 00:27:13.572]  Euro reaches 11th hour deal as Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy hold crisis talks.
[00:27:13.592 --> 00:27:15.473]  So they're trying to reach this 11th hour deal.
[00:27:15.513 --> 00:27:16.413]  They haven't reached it yet.
[00:27:17.394 --> 00:27:18.294]  And it continues.
[00:27:18.394 --> 00:27:24.417]  Early on Thursday morning, after seven hours of talks, Germany and France reached a common position on a second bailout of Greece.
[00:27:24.457 --> 00:27:26.258]  So, somewhat of a deal, but not completely.
[00:27:26.698 --> 00:27:28.939]  But details of that accord were not revealed.
[00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:30.580]  You can't let the slaves know what's going on.
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:33.681]  The German Chancellor and French President have been
[00:27:35.646 --> 00:27:40.847]  Barrage with pleas from political and financial leaders to reach an agreement or risk the collapse of the single currency.
[00:27:41.368 --> 00:27:53.691]  And then they'll give them trillions more of taxpayer money to the bankers, and then you go into more debt to prop them up, and then a month from now after this new deal, they'll say, now we need trillions more, or things will collapse, and then trillions more will be given.
[00:27:54.071 --> 00:28:00.336]  And they'll say, now we need trillions more, we need to raise your taxes more, and cut more services, or things will collapse, and then more will be given.
[00:28:00.376 --> 00:28:01.336]  Same thing here in the U.S.
[00:28:01.757 --> 00:28:04.499]  And on and on and on and on and on forever, just like a third world country.
[00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:09.142]  Just like Nigeria, just like Brazil, just like Argentina.
[00:28:09.683 --> 00:28:14.906]  Argentina, more wealthy 80 years ago per capita than any other country in the world except for Switzerland.
[00:28:15.347 --> 00:28:19.210]  The saying was, as rich as an Argentine, or an Argentine.
[00:28:20.296 --> 00:28:20.977]  Not anymore.
[00:28:22.237 --> 00:28:25.960]  Ted Anderson was down there last year and he said it was hellish.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:33.325]  And he said, you see families, not drunken homeless people, but good looking families living in doorways with their children everywhere.
[00:28:33.605 --> 00:28:35.006]  Police stomping around.
[00:28:35.026 --> 00:28:39.569]  A once wealthy nation that signed on to the banker system destroyed.
[00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:44.004]  I'll never forget that article in 2000, 2001, The Washington Post.
[00:28:44.024 --> 00:28:46.247]  The Washington Post reporter witnessed it.
[00:28:46.748 --> 00:28:55.681]  An 18-wheeler carrying Black Angus beef, premium beef, turned over two weeks into the total collapse and there were families
[00:28:56.181 --> 00:29:12.292]  It described like Robinson Crusoe in their suits but with torn torn jackets and in holes in them with dirt all over their faces running up with knives and cutting off giant bloblets of beef and gobbling it with their children with blood all over them.
[00:29:12.332 --> 00:29:14.653]  You can pull that article up just just like piranhas.
[00:29:16.455 --> 00:29:17.916]  Just like tearing into the meat.
[00:29:17.936 --> 00:29:23.321]  Because they hyperinflated their currency, they shut down all the infrastructure when they quote, defaulted.
[00:29:23.682 --> 00:29:25.984]  So we're just being maneuvered into the inevitable default.
[00:29:26.685 --> 00:29:30.729]  They're just getting as deeper threatening default now as they get as deeper down the rat hole.
[00:29:31.229 --> 00:29:34.132]  Germany, France, break Euro, bailout, deadlock.
[00:29:34.192 --> 00:29:34.532]  Yes.
[00:29:35.453 --> 00:29:35.753]  Yes.
[00:29:36.173 --> 00:29:38.935]  Rupert Murdoch's Fox News ran Black Op Department.
[00:29:38.995 --> 00:29:40.855]  Former executive claims they'll end up dead.
[00:29:41.416 --> 00:29:42.816]  That's out of the London Telegraph.
[00:29:42.836 --> 00:29:45.778]  Look for that executive to commit suicide real quick.
[00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:48.819]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.859 --> 00:29:49.419]  Stay with us.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.700]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.801]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:56.403]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:03.572]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:03.872 --> 00:30:04.492]  Number one.
[00:30:04.792 --> 00:30:07.934]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.215 --> 00:30:08.795]  Number two.
[00:30:09.075 --> 00:30:13.618]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:14.419]  It's true.
[00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:19.282]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:19.582 --> 00:30:20.142]  Number three.
[00:30:20.422 --> 00:30:23.704]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:27.707]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:27.907 --> 00:30:28.448]  Number 4.
[00:30:28.688 --> 00:30:31.051]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:34.835]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.135 --> 00:30:35.676]  Number 5.
[00:30:35.936 --> 00:30:39.840]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.081 --> 00:30:44.846]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:45.126 --> 00:30:49.149]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:49.289 --> 00:30:50.850]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:53.152]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:53.332 --> 00:30:55.674]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:31:00.399 --> 00:31:04.040]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.421]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:12.442]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:12.462 --> 00:31:18.663]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:18.843 --> 00:31:21.084]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:21.624 --> 00:31:21.904]  Tim Geithner?
[00:31:21.924 --> 00:31:22.164]  Bernanke?
[00:31:22.184 --> 00:31:22.724]  They're arsonists!
[00:31:22.765 --> 00:31:23.545]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:23.565 --> 00:31:25.246]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:47.495]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:47.815 --> 00:31:56.919]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:00.865 --> 00:32:04.506]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:04.826 --> 00:32:12.948]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:32:13.689 --> 00:32:17.730]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:29.133]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:32:29.773 --> 00:32:38.781]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:32:39.282 --> 00:32:44.346]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:34:43.318 --> 00:34:48.362]  Uh, to satanic activities of the globalist, and their bizarre activities, and their mindsets.
[00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:51.145]  It's all at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:34:51.165 --> 00:34:56.149]  You can go there and download and burn to disk all my films, the thousands.
[00:34:56.209 --> 00:34:57.330]  It's been up there eight years.
[00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:02.174]  We had some of the archives were broken for a while, like stuff going back eight years ago, but that's all been fixed now.
[00:35:02.914 --> 00:35:11.399]  So there's just thousands and thousands and thousands of pieces of media at PrisonPlanet.tv, a higher quality audio podcast every single day, commercial free.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.041]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:17.463]  Okay, I want to get into our top story today.
[00:35:18.243 --> 00:35:19.084]  I don't know.
[00:35:40.245 --> 00:35:42.546]  I mean, this is 100% overt what they've done with this.
[00:35:43.206 --> 00:35:46.448]  And so I want to break that down coming up in a moment.
[00:35:46.948 --> 00:35:51.290]  But first, one of the sponsors that makes this radio show possible is Mike Adams.
[00:35:52.311 --> 00:35:55.092]  He has put out a new incredible piece of media.
[00:35:55.472 --> 00:36:00.695]  Mike Adams has put together an incredible multimedia course on food security that teaches you the skills to stay alive.
[00:36:01.155 --> 00:36:04.777]  And well-fed during any crisis and going into this depression, this is key.
[00:36:05.138 --> 00:36:18.866]  You will learn things about how to build your own emergency water filter, how to create your own emergency food go-bag, how to store and purify water using iodine, created by Mike Adams, the health ranger and expert in food security, and of course the guest of this broadcast.
[00:36:19.166 --> 00:36:21.288]  The entire course is available for instant access.
[00:36:22.068 --> 00:36:23.549]  With downloadable mp3 files.
[00:36:24.329 --> 00:36:26.030]  You can play on any device.
[00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:30.172]  50% off sale for Alex Jones listeners ends Sunday night.
[00:36:30.472 --> 00:36:30.992]  50% off.
[00:36:31.452 --> 00:36:32.272]  You got three, four days.
[00:36:32.313 --> 00:36:33.013]  Take advantage of that.

[00:36:36.014 --> 00:36:37.595]  Naturalnews.com forward slash Alex.
[00:36:37.635 --> 00:36:40.156]  Again, that's naturalnews.com forward slash Alex.
[00:36:40.716 --> 00:36:44.318]  Or follow the banners on infowars.com.
[00:36:45.918 --> 00:36:46.239]  Okay.
[00:36:54.366 --> 00:37:06.855]  I need to pause for a moment because I will tend to spin out and my RPMs will go up too high and I won't calmly go over every aspect of this next report.
[00:37:08.557 --> 00:37:18.785]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists and I shot a video breaking down the different facets of this.
[00:37:19.915 --> 00:37:27.756]  uh... this morning big sis tries to turn minorities against whites by labeling whites terrorist uh... that report
[00:37:29.126 --> 00:37:30.127]  I don't know.
[00:37:52.703 --> 00:37:54.084]  I wrote this little blurb this morning.
[00:37:54.804 --> 00:37:56.205]  Watson's article is more detailed.
[00:37:56.225 --> 00:37:58.445]  For nine years this has been taught to police behind closed doors.
[00:37:58.465 --> 00:38:01.466]  We have the training manuals, the training videos sent to us by good police.
[00:38:01.486 --> 00:38:02.387]  That's how we know that.
[00:38:17.202 --> 00:38:19.703]  Now they're rolling it out in public, as we told you they would.
[00:38:19.743 --> 00:38:21.603]  They would announce White Al Qaeda is coming to get you.
[00:38:22.223 --> 00:38:29.845]  The propagandists in the past sold good ol' boys on the police state to keep us safe from Al-Cieda.
[00:38:30.485 --> 00:38:33.846]  They then turn it around on the whole public.
[00:38:34.586 --> 00:38:35.746]  We'll go to that video in a little while.
[00:38:36.486 --> 00:38:43.268]  Some whites are racist against minorities, so the federal takeover is sold
[00:38:44.188 --> 00:38:44.809]  In the name
[00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:10.414]  Bad, but the real terrorists that actually stage the attacks are loving protectors, the feds.
[00:39:10.534 --> 00:39:14.436]  So we're being told, and we're going to go to that video again a little bit later, we are told that
[00:39:25.902 --> 00:39:28.545]  That the government is here to keep us safe.
[00:39:28.625 --> 00:39:34.131]  We are told that they're doing everything they can to stop Al Qaeda from striking you at any minute.
[00:39:34.812 --> 00:39:36.113]  And then we learn on record...
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:37.540]  That the U.S.
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:38.961]  government was protecting the hijackers.
[00:39:39.001 --> 00:39:42.764]  That's even Senator Graham, one of the 9-11 commissioners, and five others.
[00:39:43.064 --> 00:39:44.065]  Six of the ten have said that.
[00:39:44.685 --> 00:39:46.487]  We played you the MSNBC clip last week.
[00:39:46.927 --> 00:39:52.751]  We learned that the underwear bomber, on Christmas Day, a year and a half ago, was gotten on the plane by a U.S.
[00:39:53.151 --> 00:39:53.852]  government agent.
[00:39:54.312 --> 00:39:57.374]  The State Department had to admit that they were ordered to help get him on the plane.
[00:39:57.794 --> 00:39:58.375]  In Amsterdam.
[00:39:59.696 --> 00:40:01.157]  And without a passport.
[00:40:01.177 --> 00:40:01.617]  And the U.S.
[00:40:01.637 --> 00:40:02.178]  gave him a visa.
[00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:08.371]  So the drugged out person can pop a firecracker on his pants and now we've all got to accept body scanners.
[00:40:09.131 --> 00:40:18.074]  Not only is this a domestic police state crackdown politically, it also scares us into getting behind all these illegal wars in the name of rooting out the people that attacked us.
[00:40:18.454 --> 00:40:24.736]  And also these big defense contractors make in the last decade more than two trillion dollars
[00:40:25.536 --> 00:40:39.447]  In domestic spying, over a million contractors spying, control grids, face scanning cameras, license plate reading cameras, naked body scanners, data mining, and I'm going to get into some of that news coming up that integrates with this, this is a total takeover.
[00:40:41.144 --> 00:40:41.845]  And it's very simple.
[00:40:41.885 --> 00:40:42.685]  It's a false flag.
[00:40:42.725 --> 00:40:45.747]  Hitler firebombs the Reichstag to declare a police state in Germany.
[00:40:46.308 --> 00:40:50.851]  Hitler blows up his own military base in Gleiwitz to blame on the Poles to launch World War II.
[00:40:51.672 --> 00:40:52.813]  The Tsars did it in Russia.
[00:40:52.873 --> 00:40:53.713]  The Soviets did it.
[00:40:53.953 --> 00:40:55.815]  The British have been caught doing it over and over again.
[00:40:55.875 --> 00:41:05.982]  Mainline British headlines, you know, MI6 running the IRA, staging bombings as a pretext to clamp down on the Irish as an excuse to continue to keep troops there.
[00:41:06.002 --> 00:41:08.084]  I mean, this is the oldest trick in the book.
[00:41:09.355 --> 00:41:14.739]  Obama ships tens of thousands of guns into Mexico to cause a crime wave to then blame it on the Second Amendment.
[00:41:14.979 --> 00:41:20.844]  And even when he gets caught, he's still using it outside of law and outside of courts to go in.
[00:41:20.864 --> 00:41:26.569]  I was talking to one of my friends the other day who bought two semi-automatic rifles because they were on sale.
[00:41:27.089 --> 00:41:27.770]  I've done that before.
[00:41:28.915 --> 00:41:30.656]  And it's a great, by the way, investment.
[00:41:30.676 --> 00:41:33.137]  All my guns have gone up in price than I bought, you know, 15 years ago.
[00:41:33.877 --> 00:41:35.978]  And he got an ATF-FBI visit at his house.
[00:41:36.478 --> 00:41:37.258]  No criminal record.
[00:41:37.518 --> 00:41:39.039]  It's creating the idea that you're evil.
[00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:42.760]  And the ATF orders gun shops to do things that aren't even the law.
[00:41:43.661 --> 00:41:44.641]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:41:44.701 --> 00:41:45.882]  That's what martial law is.
[00:41:45.922 --> 00:41:47.522]  That's what dictatorship is.
[00:41:47.762 --> 00:41:53.364]  Well, I don't care if the House won't pass a law that we can put carbon taxes on coal-powered plants.
[00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:54.305]  I'm Obama.
[00:41:54.385 --> 00:41:55.045]  I'm just going to do it.
[00:41:55.605 --> 00:41:56.866]  By the way, my friends are exempt.
[00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:00.883]  This is absolute criminal takeover.
[00:42:01.883 --> 00:42:03.264]  I mean, realize that.
[00:42:03.364 --> 00:42:04.384]  But, I digress.
[00:42:06.385 --> 00:42:08.286]  And I won't have time to play the whole nine minute video.
[00:42:08.386 --> 00:42:10.588]  It is propaganda that is unspeakable.
[00:42:10.608 --> 00:42:26.316]  I'm going to probably shoot a special report in the next few days where I just take excise pieces of this and really in a well-documented, slick way show people what's happening instead of just up here talking about it because words cannot describe how wicked and duplicitous this is.
[00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:28.790]  What did Hitler do?
[00:42:29.231 --> 00:42:31.472]  First, he goes after unpopular groups in Germany.
[00:42:31.532 --> 00:42:34.313]  Jews, gypsies, communists.
[00:42:35.054 --> 00:42:38.336]  And he takes their rights away, in law, and people get behind it.
[00:42:38.416 --> 00:42:39.156]  Yeah, get them.
[00:42:39.996 --> 00:42:52.183]  Then he's swungin' around against Christians, against Protestants, against Seventh-Day Adventists, you name it, against his competition in business, even fellow Nazis.
[00:42:52.863 --> 00:42:55.905]  They would rob their companies and send them off to a death camp.
[00:42:58.186 --> 00:42:59.186]  This is what they did.
[00:42:59.206 --> 00:43:04.147]  A lot of the French that helped the Nazis take over France, they got turned against.
[00:43:05.827 --> 00:43:06.748]  A lot of the Vichy did.
[00:43:08.288 --> 00:43:09.288]  So that's how this works.
[00:43:09.328 --> 00:43:12.088]  You first set something up with an unpopular group.
[00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:25.571]  And whether it's a good thing to make Muslims and Arabs unpopular or not, and obviously it's discrimination and stereotypical and wrong, it was acceptable to say these people are devils, nuke them, to call them horrible
[00:43:26.471 --> 00:43:26.731]  I don't
[00:43:43.948 --> 00:43:48.110]  This was being beta tested on them to then be used against everybody else.
[00:43:48.150 --> 00:44:07.139]  And I told you from the FBI, Federal Marshal, State Police in California, Missouri, State Police in Florida, Texas, Federal Marshal sending me SLAT training, the videos, we've shown them here, we've done special reports on it, where they say, who are the number one terrorists?
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:07.840]  Gun owners.
[00:44:10.539 --> 00:44:14.182]  Returning veterans, libertarians, in the fetters, Ron Paul supporters.
[00:44:14.502 --> 00:44:15.923]  I mean, I have the training manuals here.
[00:44:16.383 --> 00:44:18.765]  The Homeland Security, the MIAC reports.
[00:44:18.785 --> 00:44:20.426]  Remember this being national news two years ago?
[00:44:21.647 --> 00:44:22.308]  Remember all this?
[00:44:23.769 --> 00:44:23.909]  Now...
[00:44:25.416 --> 00:44:26.017]  I told you!
[00:44:26.698 --> 00:44:27.859]  They've taken over the Middle East.
[00:44:27.879 --> 00:44:29.001]  They've invaded all the countries.
[00:44:29.521 --> 00:44:34.708]  They now are flipping over to work with Al-Qaeda to overthrow Gaddafi, the Muslim Brotherhood to overthrow Mubarak.
[00:44:34.948 --> 00:44:36.270]  They're now shifting to a new face.
[00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.475]  They're going to keep the Muslim demonization going, but it's now a dish that's cooked.
[00:44:40.755 --> 00:44:42.397]  They just put it on the back burner to keep it warm.
[00:44:43.038 --> 00:44:47.260]  And they've killed bin Laden in their staged event.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:45:03.006]  They're now moving on to the next phase to, okay, we don't have a Bill of Rights, we spy on you, you have no rights, we can secretly arrest citizens under the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, Enemy Commissions Act, we can fly you to places to be tortured, we can secretly execute you, Obama's continuing it.
[00:45:04.187 --> 00:45:12.170]  Now the next phase, they've already been beta testing, behind closed doors with the police and military, now they're moving it to white al-Qaeda.
[00:45:13.123 --> 00:45:26.174]  And in this video, they cut to, and every one of them were mentally ill patsies, it's been confirmed, even Main Street News admits, Jihad J and others, blue eyes, animating the blue eyes in the video to glow, look blue, blue, they're Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:26.675 --> 00:45:31.499]  And it shows, at the beginning of this Homeland Security 9-minute video, a shot of family,
[00:45:37.142 --> 00:45:39.264]  You know, thinking about all that's good in America.
[00:45:39.304 --> 00:45:40.045]  Nostalgia.
[00:45:40.625 --> 00:45:41.747]  On top of the piano.
[00:45:42.287 --> 00:45:47.872]  And 90 plus percent of the photos of the American family, it's Hispanics, it's Asians, it's black people.
[00:45:48.233 --> 00:45:49.154]  So you see it instantly.
[00:45:49.374 --> 00:45:51.796]  And there's one white guy, but he's blurred in the background.
[00:45:52.637 --> 00:45:54.319]  So it's like, this is America.
[00:45:54.759 --> 00:45:56.141]  And we are many people.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.821]  And then it cuts to a black guy.
[00:45:58.901 --> 00:45:59.661]  He's professional.
[00:45:59.722 --> 00:46:00.662]  He's good in his suit.
[00:46:01.062 --> 00:46:05.726]  He's no longer being stereotypically put down by the same media, same government as a gangbanger.
[00:46:06.046 --> 00:46:12.050]  He's going out in the parking garage and he sees evil white guys getting ready to blow up the building and he calls it in on them.
[00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:17.894]  And then the good white guys, the only good white guys in the whole thing, FBI, show up.
[00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:22.135]  They stopped the white Al Qaeda that's just everywhere.
[00:46:22.155 --> 00:46:36.633]  They're creating this false perception ahead of the private contractors that run the government, staging more of terror to take over society even more so you won't be mad about going into austerity or having your social security taken or everything imploding and all the money going to the offshore banks.
[00:46:37.834 --> 00:46:38.514]  No, no, no.
[00:46:38.594 --> 00:46:42.815]  And then it just cuts to white Al-Qaeda, white Al-Qaeda, blue-eyed women, they're gonna get you.
[00:46:43.155 --> 00:46:44.475]  And then they mix in McVeigh.
[00:46:44.495 --> 00:46:45.635]  Of course, that was a staged event.
[00:46:45.675 --> 00:46:49.616]  They mix in all of this white, white, white, white, white, white, white.
[00:46:49.956 --> 00:46:52.577]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[00:46:53.397 --> 00:46:57.297]  Now, remember, I've told you for nine years, white Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:58.217 --> 00:46:59.658]  I even said they're gonna call it white Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:59.758 --> 00:47:00.498]  I know them.
[00:47:00.658 --> 00:47:01.418]  I studied them.
[00:47:01.658 --> 00:47:04.899]  I'm like a criminologist following a serial killer for decades.
[00:47:04.959 --> 00:47:05.839]  I know their next move.
[00:47:06.139 --> 00:47:06.679]  I'm on record.
[00:47:07.952 --> 00:47:10.554]  And it may even be they just grabbed the terms I come up with.
[00:47:10.994 --> 00:47:21.963]  Like I told you about propaganda placement, and message placement, and police state placement, now they even use those terms.
[00:47:21.983 --> 00:47:24.665]  So I don't know if it's chicken or the egg, which one came first.
[00:47:24.685 --> 00:47:29.469]  The point is, then about six years ago, white Al-Qaeda, white Al-Qaeda, white Al-Qaeda, white Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:30.845 --> 00:47:34.588]  Actually, now that I remember, England started it nine years ago, so I saw them do it first.
[00:47:34.648 --> 00:47:35.668]  I didn't actually predict it.
[00:47:36.129 --> 00:47:37.029]  I'm going back to memory now.
[00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:37.890]  So it started there.
[00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:38.590]  I knew it was coming here.
[00:47:39.111 --> 00:47:39.971]  So that's going on.
[00:47:39.991 --> 00:47:42.653]  Then I get the manuals from police going, yeah, this is what they're telling us.
[00:47:43.534 --> 00:47:46.696]  The rural council, the spy on neighbors, everything else.
[00:47:48.917 --> 00:47:58.843]  I knew from manuals that came in and sources that all over the country, mainly rural areas, they'll say, we're having a meeting at the Law Enforcement Center this weekend, free donuts and lunch.
[00:47:59.303 --> 00:48:05.106]  Anybody who's concerned about Al-Qaeda and terror attacks, this has happened right from 9-11 and since, we want you to come down to the meeting.
[00:48:05.607 --> 00:48:14.292]  And you get there, they show an Al-Qaeda training video, and they say, okay, now let's get to McVeigh, let's get to Ron Paul supporters, let's get to gun owners, let's get to returning veterans.
[00:48:14.993 --> 00:48:16.460]  And most of the folks get upset and leave.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.023]  They don't care.
[00:48:17.385 --> 00:48:19.294]  They find the people that want to be part of it.
[00:48:20.014 --> 00:48:23.236]  And I told you they tried to recruit my dad, the other dentist he works with.
[00:48:23.377 --> 00:48:25.718]  Not because he's my dad, they're doing it to any professionals.
[00:48:26.159 --> 00:48:30.522]  Lawyers, any type of corporate CEO, even to small companies.
[00:48:30.902 --> 00:48:35.165]  They give them little cards, it's called InfraGard, they've recruited now over 100,000 preachers.
[00:48:35.626 --> 00:48:39.709]  And they tell them, spy on your flock, tell them submit to government, things are going to collapse.
[00:48:40.049 --> 00:48:42.191]  This has been going on for six years that we know of.
[00:48:42.411 --> 00:48:46.474]  The clergy response teams, just search that term, you'll see newscast after we reported it.
[00:48:47.154 --> 00:48:50.398]  Uh, admitting, oh, it's great, they're training to tell the flock to go to the camps.
[00:48:50.838 --> 00:48:53.301]  And it shows the preacher saying it's of the Lord to go to the camps.
[00:48:53.681 --> 00:48:55.022]  It's of the Lord to take the shots.
[00:48:55.363 --> 00:48:56.143]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:48:56.644 --> 00:49:01.229]  If you haven't seen us play that video here probably 20 times, just search Clergy Response Teams on YouTube, you'll get it.
[00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:04.792]  It's also in Police State 4, Rise of FEMA, little clips of the news.
[00:49:05.613 --> 00:49:09.977]  And so they've got the entire, uh, grid set up
[00:49:10.948 --> 00:49:24.360]  Over 90% of the training, with police and military together, under FBI command, under DHS command, and you go to these drills, or I've been sent photos of the drills, and video, and the roster of the drills, it's gotta be more than 95%.
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:34.028]  It's all people wearing feed, lot caps, dressed like rednecks, going, you're not taking my land!
[00:49:34.328 --> 00:49:37.070]  And then a bomb goes off, and they tell the police,
[00:49:37.987 --> 00:49:39.509]  The farmers attacked us.
[00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:44.153]  So they're scripting it and putting farmers in the role that they're terrorists.
[00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:50.640]  The cops play the role and are so weak-minded, they then now believe that farmers are going to blow them up.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.905]  And so now it's okay with a heavy machine gun, they mow the farmers down.
[00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:56.666]  This was going on in 2002 at bases.
[00:49:58.388 --> 00:50:02.372]  I had contractors who were working at the base who shot video on top of the building.
[00:50:02.392 --> 00:50:05.396]  They were retarring, and they would not let me show the video.
[00:50:05.456 --> 00:50:06.477]  They came up to Access.
[00:50:06.777 --> 00:50:07.638]  They showed it to me.
[00:50:07.918 --> 00:50:11.903]  The Marines at an Army base, and the people are like, no.
[00:50:12.003 --> 00:50:14.746]  And of course, I shot some video myself at drills of similar things.
[00:50:14.946 --> 00:50:19.689]  We're Americans, oh no, please not the camp, and interrogating them and asking the role players, where'd you get the guns?
[00:50:19.989 --> 00:50:21.510]  Well, I got my gun in San Francisco.
[00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:22.670]  I mean, that's in Police Day 2000.
[00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:26.172]  But these guys showed me footage, and I said, please let me show this.
[00:50:26.192 --> 00:50:29.174]  They said, we'll come back, maybe later, but they'll know we were contractors.
[00:50:29.194 --> 00:50:32.756]  And I said, I'll blow up the video where they can't tell you we're on the roof, and they said no.
[00:50:33.396 --> 00:50:34.978]  We had to sign forms to be on the base.
[00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:35.519]  We can't do it.
[00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:46.992]  Then I got confirmed news articles where they train all the ROTCs around the country, including San Antonio, when they have drills in the local forest with the ROTC, the military, people in college to be officers.
[00:50:47.252 --> 00:50:50.496]  They always fight militias and anti-fellow reserve people.
[00:50:50.536 --> 00:50:51.717]  So the entire...
[00:50:52.765 --> 00:50:55.786]  It's just like in the Cold War, the military trained to fight the Russians.
[00:50:56.506 --> 00:50:59.508]  For at least 10 years, the military trains to fight the American people.
[00:50:59.528 --> 00:51:02.869]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:07.431]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:51:07.631 --> 00:51:15.494]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:51:15.834 --> 00:51:18.657]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:51:18.937 --> 00:51:26.484]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:51:26.584 --> 00:51:32.169]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:51:32.409 --> 00:51:37.975]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:51:38.255 --> 00:51:41.498]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:51:41.778 --> 00:51:45.141]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:51:45.361 --> 00:51:50.406]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:51:50.446 --> 00:51:53.308]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:51:53.348 --> 00:51:53.528]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:51:59.039 --> 00:52:03.263]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:52:03.583 --> 00:52:04.183]  Number 1.
[00:52:04.504 --> 00:52:07.626]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:52:07.927 --> 00:52:08.487]  Number 2.
[00:52:08.787 --> 00:52:13.331]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:14.112]  It's true.
[00:52:14.412 --> 00:52:18.976]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:52:19.276 --> 00:52:19.817]  Number 3.
[00:52:20.117 --> 00:52:23.400]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.383]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:52:27.583 --> 00:52:28.144]  Number 4.
[00:52:28.384 --> 00:52:30.746]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:52:31.146 --> 00:52:34.529]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:35.050]  Number 5.
[00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:39.554]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:52:39.774 --> 00:52:44.538]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:52:44.818 --> 00:52:48.843]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:52:48.983 --> 00:52:50.545]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:52:50.765 --> 00:52:52.867]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:52:53.027 --> 00:52:55.290]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.952]  Will I have garlic breath after I take Ali-C?
[00:53:02.421 --> 00:53:15.294]  We get that question all the time about the world's best garlic extract, Alley C. And the answer is, Alley C contains stabilized allicin, nature's antimicrobial agent, and the active ingredient in crushed garlic, but will not give you garlic breath.
[00:53:15.615 --> 00:53:22.582]  Scientifically proven in double-blind studies, using low doses of allicin greatly reduces the number, severity, and duration of common colds.
[00:53:22.862 --> 00:53:26.746]  Our powerful Ali-C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin.
[00:53:27.006 --> 00:53:30.830]  Just one tablet of Ali-C is equivalent to 40 garlic cloves.
[00:53:31.111 --> 00:53:37.898]  It's effective against asthma, MRSA, bacterial fungal and viral infections, and helps lower high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
[00:53:37.998 --> 00:53:39.940]  Plus, it's a natural mosquito repellent.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.003]  Boost resistance to infection with nature's best garlic extract.
[00:53:43.343 --> 00:53:45.304]  Okay, I'm going to play some of this video.
[00:54:13.715 --> 00:54:16.016]  If you're at PrisonPlanet.tv, you'll be able to see it.
[00:54:16.116 --> 00:54:17.837]  If not, go to Infowars.com.
[00:54:19.237 --> 00:54:24.540]  And the headline is, Big Sis Tries to Turn Minorities Against Whites by Labeling Them Terrorists.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.460]  That's one of the articles.
[00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:31.883]  The other big article that's on Drudge is, DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:41.788]  And this is why I've always known that even if the government isn't staging the terror, and unfortunately the evidence is overwhelming, they are, it's ridiculous how much evidence there is, the entire
[00:54:42.648 --> 00:54:47.369]  The key here is that they've set up the entire architecture and the training and the drills for the American people.
[00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:48.129]  I only know of one drill
[00:55:13.166 --> 00:55:19.009]  And I know about it because I had some family involved out at Camp Mabry a year ago.
[00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:27.112]  And the public was invited where they had a guy with a Muslim turban on and the fake beard and practiced killing some terrorists with some helicopters over there.
[00:55:27.132 --> 00:55:28.093]  And that was just for the public.
[00:55:28.193 --> 00:55:29.273]  Oh, look, we're killing the Muslims.
[00:55:29.653 --> 00:55:31.514]  But you go to the real internal drills.
[00:55:31.674 --> 00:55:33.135]  It is kill those U.S.
[00:55:33.175 --> 00:55:33.615]  militias.
[00:55:33.875 --> 00:55:34.436]  Take them out.
[00:55:34.736 --> 00:55:36.336]  Remember New York Times a couple of years ago.
[00:55:36.356 --> 00:55:37.177]  We showed you the article.
[00:55:37.217 --> 00:55:39.558]  It said Explorer Scouts nationwide.
[00:55:39.638 --> 00:55:41.739]  It showed photos trained to kill disgruntled vets.
[00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:44.131]  It's for you!
[00:55:44.491 --> 00:55:45.071]  It's for you!
[00:55:45.131 --> 00:55:48.954]  Let's say Al Qaeda did 9-11 just for laughs.
[00:55:49.374 --> 00:55:49.935]  Okay, fine.
[00:55:50.195 --> 00:55:53.057]  They've used it to set up a grid for the American people.
[00:55:53.577 --> 00:55:57.940]  And they're now telling minorities, who are the majority in most cities, hey, it's whitey.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:58.541]  Get him.
[00:55:59.421 --> 00:56:01.642]  And they're now rebranding that.
[00:56:01.682 --> 00:56:05.904]  So first they tell white racists, hey, give up your rights, because it's only for the Muslims.
[00:56:06.185 --> 00:56:10.247]  Now they say, hey, give up your rights, blacks and Hispanics, it's for whitey.
[00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.848]  And when you're done, everybody loses their rights.
[00:56:13.388 --> 00:56:15.409]  This is how they compartmentalize and sell this.
[00:56:15.689 --> 00:56:16.530]  Let's play part of it.
[00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:26.035]  Some of it doesn't have audio, so I'll voice it while it rolls, where it cuts to the new America, non-white, the good people, and then it cuts to the evil whites.
[00:56:26.075 --> 00:56:26.455]  Here it is.
[00:56:28.616 --> 00:56:29.957]  Oh, look at the good Americans.
[00:56:29.977 --> 00:56:34.620]  The United States of America is home to over 330 million people.
[00:56:36.321 --> 00:56:40.604]  We are a country known for freedom, justice, and opportunity.
[00:56:40.624 --> 00:56:42.325]  9 out of 10 are not white in the photos.
[00:56:42.705 --> 00:56:51.511]  The American dream draws people from across the globe, bringing different cultures, traditions, and ideas to the fabric of our great nation.
[00:56:51.531 --> 00:56:53.372]  There's a white guy, but he's only good as in the military.
[00:56:55.675 --> 00:56:59.037]  There's white people?
[00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:04.320]  Look, a white guy.
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:07.222]  A white van.
[00:57:09.543 --> 00:57:11.725]  That's Invoke McVeigh, the good black guy.
[00:57:12.265 --> 00:57:13.886]  He recognizes the devil whiting.
[00:57:18.949 --> 00:57:20.410]  It's also about being paranoid.
[00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:21.391]  Terrorists are everywhere.
[00:57:22.483 --> 00:57:23.764]  The black guy sees the white people.
[00:57:23.944 --> 00:57:24.525]  Oh my gosh.
[00:57:25.065 --> 00:57:26.366]  They're not a white fan, they're terrorists.
[00:57:27.407 --> 00:57:29.089]  He's gonna call Homeland Security, don't worry.
[00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:34.273]  And then it just cuts to evil white, after evil white, after evil white.
[00:57:34.994 --> 00:57:37.436]  And they say, whites are the number one threat.
[00:57:38.076 --> 00:57:39.357]  Which is what their own manuals say.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.542]  Again, even the whiteys are with Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:46.123 --> 00:57:46.964]  Oh, more whiteys.
[00:57:48.545 --> 00:57:49.626]  He's hiding down in his seat.
[00:57:49.766 --> 00:57:50.527]  Oh no, the whiteys.
[00:57:54.994 --> 00:57:57.055]  He's driving out of those for some scary whiteys.
[00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:03.499]  Calls Homeland Security that the good whites come.
[00:58:04.359 --> 00:58:04.619]  Hello.
[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:09.642]  Listen, I don't know if this is anything, but what I just saw looked really suspicious.
[00:58:09.922 --> 00:58:10.082]  Oh.
[00:58:10.342 --> 00:58:12.083]  Definitely out of the ordinary.
[00:58:12.103 --> 00:58:13.344]  Alright, pause.
[00:58:15.555 --> 00:58:16.796]  We're going to come back with the rest of it.
[00:58:17.476 --> 00:58:18.897]  Oh, hey, I saw something out of the ordinary.
[00:58:18.937 --> 00:58:19.518]  I saw a U.S.
[00:58:19.558 --> 00:58:24.101]  government agent get a drugged out black kid on the airplane in Amsterdam.
[00:58:24.121 --> 00:58:27.403]  Yeah, he didn't have a passport or anything, but they got him on the plane.
[00:58:28.244 --> 00:58:29.705]  Shut up, Mr. Haskell.
[00:58:29.725 --> 00:58:30.565]  We don't know anything about that.
[00:58:31.326 --> 00:58:33.267]  By the way, the firecracker blew up in his pants.
[00:58:33.327 --> 00:58:34.248]  I want to give you a report.
[00:58:34.308 --> 00:58:35.369]  Shut up, Mr. Haskell.
[00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:36.449]  Turned out it was all true.
[00:58:36.629 --> 00:58:38.211]  I want to report the government's the terrorist.
[00:58:43.204 --> 00:58:46.968]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:49.431 --> 00:58:50.572]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:50.592 --> 00:58:57.279]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:57.539 --> 00:58:59.821]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:00.082 --> 00:59:05.267]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:05.447 --> 00:59:08.229]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:08.489 --> 00:59:10.610]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:16.733]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:17.073 --> 00:59:20.255]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:25.958]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:26.218 --> 00:59:27.539]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:27.859 --> 00:59:29.040]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.701]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:31.841 --> 00:59:33.262]  He explains everything you need to know.
[00:59:33.522 --> 00:59:35.884]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:36.044 --> 00:59:40.548]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:40.668 --> 00:59:41.668]  That's End of America.
[00:59:41.808 --> 00:59:43.130]  The number 3.com.
[00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:46.972]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:47.133 --> 00:59:48.894]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[00:59:52.297 --> 00:59:54.258]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.718 --> 00:59:57.481]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:11.335]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to finish getting into the big news report.
[01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:17.939]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[01:00:34.742 --> 01:00:36.924]  And then we are going to open the phones up.
[01:00:37.204 --> 01:00:38.726]  They're not open yet, but I'm going to open the phones up.
[01:00:38.786 --> 01:00:40.708]  Specifically, do you see through this?
[01:00:40.748 --> 01:00:45.432]  See, first they say, get rid of America's liberties, because, you know, it's brown folks we want to go after.
[01:00:45.853 --> 01:00:49.476]  And so a lot of whites go, yeah, I'm scared of brown people, even if you're not racist.
[01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:51.678]  Some whites are so guilt-ridden they're scared.
[01:00:52.199 --> 01:00:55.061]  And so, OK, well, we're just taking the Muslims' rights or the brown people's rights.
[01:00:56.022 --> 01:00:58.763]  And then, now that they've got that in place, okay, now they're going to shift it over.
[01:00:58.823 --> 01:00:59.703]  No, it's the whitey.
[01:01:00.283 --> 01:01:02.263]  He's going to get you to get the minorities after it.
[01:01:02.463 --> 01:01:08.745]  And this nine-minute video goes on and on, you know, where 90% of the photos of the good people are, quote, minorities.
[01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:10.025]  You know, there's only a few whites.
[01:01:10.065 --> 01:01:12.166]  And then the black guy's reporting on the whites.
[01:01:12.226 --> 01:01:13.386]  And then, G.I.
[01:01:13.446 --> 01:01:17.727]  Jane, her eyes are, you know, shining blue, have been accentuated.
[01:01:18.627 --> 01:01:23.348]  I mean, clearly, as somebody that works in media and recognizes propaganda, this is off the chart.
[01:01:23.688 --> 01:01:32.590]  Then we have all the actual training manuals that law enforcement have given us, where it's all about Ron Paul, conservatives, libertarians, gun owners, patriots.
[01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:38.451]  And then they make it about being white, because they say, and these people are probably racist.
[01:01:40.772 --> 01:01:42.572]  You see, so which then makes it racial.
[01:01:44.246 --> 01:01:57.830]  And so that's how they're always injecting this and, you know, talking about McVeigh and Elohim City and the Oklahoma City bombing, but never getting into the fact that those were staged events.
[01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:01.911]  Here's part of Paul Watson's article and we'll come back with the rest of the video and my analysis of it.
[01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:06.873]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:17.417]  Big CIS fear campaign continues, but Americans are just as likely to be killed by peanut allergies than they are in terrorist attacks.
[01:02:18.337 --> 01:02:24.702]  A new promotional video released by the Department of Homeland Security characterizes white middle-class Americans as the most likely terrorist.
[01:02:25.322 --> 01:02:30.706]  As Big CIS continues its relentless drive, we should add some articles where they talk about white al-Qaeda the next threat.
[01:02:31.167 --> 01:02:33.809]  You know, we know what this is also because of the past scripting.
[01:02:34.935 --> 01:02:46.586]  As Big Sis continues its relentless drive to cement the myth that mad bombers are hiding around every corner, when in reality Americans are just as likely to be killed by lightning strikes or peanut allergies.
[01:02:47.107 --> 01:02:59.618]  The video is part of a Homeland Security $10 million see-something-say-something program that encourages Americans to report suspicious activity, which in every case throughout history has been a trait of oppressive dictatorial regimes.
[01:03:00.814 --> 01:03:07.216]  It's all about not trusting your fellow citizens, only trusting the big mommy government who's on record staging the terror attacks.
[01:03:08.977 --> 01:03:15.599]  In the course of a 10 minute clip, a myriad of different behavior and characterized as terrorism, including opposing surveillance.
[01:03:16.199 --> 01:03:17.660]  Oh yeah, people that don't like being surveilled.
[01:03:18.903 --> 01:03:22.204]  Using a video camera, that's why cops come in your own yard and say you can't videotape them.
[01:03:23.064 --> 01:03:24.384]  Talking to police officers.
[01:03:25.004 --> 01:03:26.365]  You don't talk to the god-like government.
[01:03:26.605 --> 01:03:33.186]  Wearing hoodies, driving vans, writing on a piece of paper, and using a cell phone recording application.
[01:03:33.687 --> 01:03:36.887]  And that's in manuals we got five years ago the feds put out in the state of Texas.
[01:03:37.307 --> 01:03:40.068]  It said, having a cell phone, wearing blue jeans.
[01:03:40.548 --> 01:03:44.989]  I saw an AP article where it said, don't just trust that priest or that woman with a baby carriage.
[01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.949]  They may be the terrorist.
[01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.950]  It's about everybody's a terrorist.
[01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:55.639]  First they start with the unpopular Muslims, then they move on to blacks in America, then they move on to the whities.
[01:03:56.821 --> 01:03:58.343]  Continuing here.
[01:04:00.768 --> 01:04:12.220]  Despite encouraging viewers not to pay attention to a person's race and determining whether or not they may be a terrorist, almost all the scenarios in the clip proceed to portray white people as the most likely terrorist.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:14.062]  You know, they show like one 9-11 hijacker.
[01:04:14.543 --> 01:04:20.889]  Bizarrely, nearly every single one of the patriotic Americans who reports on their fellow citizens is either black, Arab, or Asian.
[01:04:21.809 --> 01:04:23.070]  Again, this is all heavily scripted.
[01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.711]  They decide all this stuff beforehand.
[01:04:25.352 --> 01:04:31.476]  Imagine if the video portrayed every terrorist as an Arab and every patriotic snoop as white.
[01:04:31.777 --> 01:04:33.378]  There'd be an outcry, and rightly so.
[01:04:33.738 --> 01:04:38.201]  But this strange reversal must have been deliberate on the part of the DHS.
[01:04:38.221 --> 01:04:38.622]  But why?
[01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:43.896]  Is this merely political correctness taken to the extreme, or is this something deeper at work?
[01:04:43.936 --> 01:04:44.977]  Well, we have all the training manuals.
[01:04:45.277 --> 01:04:52.542]  I'm going to finish up with this article, and then I'm going to go to a lot more of the clip, but it just goes on and on and on.
[01:04:52.902 --> 01:04:57.385]  This is everything we predicted, everything we told you was going to happen.
[01:04:57.845 --> 01:04:58.505]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:58.525 --> 01:04:58.906]  Stay with us.
[01:04:59.588 --> 01:05:02.809]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct.

[01:05:24.013 --> 01:05:27.035]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.

[01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:03.384]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:03.684 --> 01:06:04.285]  Number 1.
[01:06:04.605 --> 01:06:07.747]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.028 --> 01:06:08.588]  Number 2.
[01:06:08.888 --> 01:06:13.432]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:13.772 --> 01:06:14.232]  It's true.
[01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:19.076]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:19.936]  Number 3.
[01:06:20.217 --> 01:06:23.499]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:23.799 --> 01:06:27.502]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:27.702 --> 01:06:28.263]  Number 4.
[01:06:28.503 --> 01:06:30.865]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:31.265 --> 01:06:34.649]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:35.169]  Number 5.
[01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:39.653]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:39.893 --> 01:06:44.638]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:48.943]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:49.103 --> 01:06:50.665]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.885 --> 01:06:52.968]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:53.128 --> 01:06:55.491]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.585]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:06.831]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:07:07.111 --> 01:07:08.473]  Saving means to make money.
[01:07:08.633 --> 01:07:17.423]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:25.268]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:07:25.688 --> 01:07:33.292]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:07:33.692 --> 01:07:38.614]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:07:38.915 --> 01:07:41.096]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[01:07:43.837 --> 01:07:45.579]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:45.739 --> 01:07:47.220]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.202 --> 01:08:22.902]  We have warned of this for years.
[01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:31.064]  That first, governments throughout history get rid of the country's liberties and freedoms by going after an unpopular minority group.
[01:08:31.664 --> 01:08:32.624]  Hitler, it was the Jews.
[01:08:32.704 --> 01:08:33.784]  Communists, stuff like that.
[01:08:34.104 --> 01:08:35.145]  Here, it was the Muslims.
[01:08:35.885 --> 01:08:39.525]  The system stages the events, provocateurs, nutcases.
[01:08:40.005 --> 01:08:42.626]  It's a whole grab bag of different types of provocateur terror.
[01:08:43.666 --> 01:08:48.547]  Then, they build the architecture of the police state for the general public.
[01:08:49.266 --> 01:08:53.009]  So they have white audiences where they say we're going after the brown people.
[01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:57.353]  Then they go to the brown audiences and they say we're going after the white people.
[01:08:57.914 --> 01:09:02.278]  And that's what this nearly 10 minute Department of Homeland Security video does.
[01:09:02.318 --> 01:09:03.138]  But it's worse than that.
[01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:09.464]  We have all the different training manuals sent to us by police and military over the years that we've published and have made national news.
[01:09:09.804 --> 01:09:11.966]  Homeland Security, MYAC, the list goes on and on.
[01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:13.868]  And in the training, over 90%
[01:09:15.999 --> 01:09:16.680]  Is for what?
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.061]  Remember a few years ago?
[01:09:18.541 --> 01:09:21.063]  Veterans seen as the number one terror threat returning home?
[01:09:22.164 --> 01:09:23.045]  Remember a few months ago?
[01:09:23.065 --> 01:09:31.352]  Okay, finally Congress voted for health care for the military, police, and fire veterans in 9-11, but you gotta go through a terror database every time you get your health care?
[01:09:31.972 --> 01:09:33.473]  They're setting that precedent.
[01:09:33.954 --> 01:09:40.959]  Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, people that like America, freedom to fascism, people that like Alex Jones.
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.521]  This is in the different manuals.
[01:09:43.683 --> 01:09:50.465]  And then they say these groups are connected to racism, so they make it about being white by saying, oh, they're connected to white supremacists when there's no connection.
[01:09:50.745 --> 01:09:58.948]  Meanwhile, Hal Turner, one of the top Nazis, it turns out, in federal court, high-level FBI operative for decades, working, of course, with Sean Hannity.
[01:10:00.188 --> 01:10:00.688]  That came out.
[01:10:00.728 --> 01:10:02.089]  Just look up Hal Turner, Sean Hannity.
[01:10:02.129 --> 01:10:02.729]  Very bizarre.
[01:10:04.329 --> 01:10:05.530]  These people are operatives.
[01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:17.417]  By the way, that's in the news today that they ran black op intelligence systems, London Telegraph reports, that News Corp, its division in England, was running black op intelligence operations.
[01:10:17.658 --> 01:10:22.741]  Their reporters were basically private contractor agents working with MI6.
[01:10:23.702 --> 01:10:25.243]  Of course they are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:26.183 --> 01:10:28.625]  Do you know about Operation Mockingbird here in the United States?
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.322]  I mean, we're in deep, deep, deep, deep trouble.
[01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:38.048]  And so they branded the war on terror with, we're taking the rights away, but we're only going to enforce it on the evil Muslims.
[01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:39.650]  In quotes.
[01:10:40.291 --> 01:10:42.533]  Now it's, oh my gosh, the white Al Qaeda.
[01:10:43.014 --> 01:10:44.735]  And in every one of the scenarios,
[01:10:45.888 --> 01:10:52.553]  Except one, in a 10 minute video, it's quote, minorities, Asians, blacks, Hispanics, reporting on the evil whites.
[01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.395]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:10:55.655 --> 01:11:05.602]  Despite encouraging viewers not to pay attention to the person's race and determining whether or not they may be a terrorist, almost all the scenarios in the clip proceed to portray white people as the most likely terrorists.
[01:11:05.663 --> 01:11:12.628]  Bizarrely, nearly every single one of the patriotic Americans who reports on their fellow citizens is either black, Asian, or Arab.
[01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:19.052]  Imagine if the video portrayed every terrorist as an Arab and every patriotic snoop as white.
[01:11:19.452 --> 01:11:21.493]  There'd be an outcry, and rightly so.
[01:11:22.073 --> 01:11:26.496]  But this strange reversal must have been deliberate on the part of the DHS.
[01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:26.976]  But why?
[01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:30.879]  Is this merely political correctness taken to the extreme, or is it something deeper at work?
[01:11:30.959 --> 01:11:34.481]  And then he goes with the proof that it's absolutely what's been going on behind the scenes.
[01:11:35.101 --> 01:11:37.323]  So, they're now shifting it on to the American people.
[01:11:37.683 --> 01:11:42.586]  DHS checkpoints, Homeland Security, TSA running wild.
[01:11:43.206 --> 01:11:51.250]  This is the total takeover, and it's meant to make all of us not trust each other in Divide and Conquer, and only trust the nanny state.
[01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:52.871]  Don't trust other Walmart shoppers.
[01:11:53.251 --> 01:12:04.657]  The telescreens say only trust Big Sis, who of course helped get the underwear bomber on the plane on record, and who helped ship the guns into Mexico, and to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:12:04.677 --> 01:12:05.617]  But she's good, though.
[01:12:07.598 --> 01:12:08.438]  Continuing here,
[01:12:12.230 --> 01:12:26.274]  This has to do with the color of a person's skin and everything to do, this has little to do with the color of a person's skin and everything to do with the fact that white middle class Americans are the biggest roadblock when it comes to big sis expanding its control over every facet of society.
[01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:28.135]  Well now they're just tackling the big egg.
[01:12:29.435 --> 01:12:31.596]  It's plain to see that very little of
[01:12:32.779 --> 01:12:41.847]  The budget for this video went towards paying for decent actors, but perhaps it's fitting that the participants were about as believable as Santa and his elves.
[01:12:42.187 --> 01:12:49.634]  Because the notion that terrorists are hovering around every underground parking lot waiting to blow up federal buildings is demonstrably false.
[01:12:50.855 --> 01:12:56.299]  Actually, when Jane Graham up in the HUD building saw McVeigh and other feds planting bombs and warn people,
[01:12:57.895 --> 01:13:00.636]  They didn't want to hear about it in Oklahoma City.
[01:13:01.196 --> 01:13:15.039]  As Ohio University John Mueller has documented, the likelihood of actually being a victim of terrorism is infinitesimally small and only highlights how much threats are hyperbolically exaggerated for political purposes.
[01:13:15.699 --> 01:13:26.121]  Figures collected by Mueller clearly show that Americans are just as likely to be killed by lightning strikes, accidents, by running into deer, or severe allergic reactions to peanuts.
[01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:34.485]  But the facts don't matter for a federal agency whose primary function is to manufacture fear, as former head of Homeland Security Governor Ridge admitted he was ordered to do.
[01:13:34.986 --> 01:13:36.006]  See, we have all the facts here.
[01:13:36.827 --> 01:13:50.695]  To keep Americans under control and submissive to the fact that their economic futures and their constitutional rights are being torn to shreds by their own government while it points to a contrived outside threat as a convenient distraction.
[01:13:52.119 --> 01:14:01.909]  At its core, the video was filled with scenes of ordinary citizens spying on each other and alerting the authorities to their compatriots' suspicious deeds, writes Simon Black.
[01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:09.217]  In my favorite scene, a woman calls the police after snooping over the shoulder of a young man typing away on his smartphone.
[01:14:10.666 --> 01:14:21.276]  Black notes that such videos are solely aimed at reinforcing ignorance, hate and fear for those who still live in darkness and are completely unaware of the real agenda behind Homeland Security's see something, say something charade.
[01:14:21.696 --> 01:14:29.824]  By the way, I'm going to call Watson during the break and during that part about the Feds issuing terror alerts to create artificial fear and make you love them and not love your neighbor.
[01:14:29.844 --> 01:14:32.106]  I'm going to have him add a link to Ridge admitting that.
[01:14:32.126 --> 01:14:34.088]  I think we need to even document that more for folks.
[01:14:35.762 --> 01:14:55.340]  No matter where you look, from East Germany to Communist Russia to Nazi Germany, historically governments who encourage their own citizens to report on each other do so not out of genuine safety concerns or presumed benefits to security, but in order to create an authoritarian police state that coerces the people into policing each other's behavior and thoughts, and to create a big chilling effect as well.
[01:14:55.601 --> 01:14:56.942]  I better not speak out about freedom.
[01:14:58.403 --> 01:15:00.106]  My neighbor will call Homeland Security on me.
[01:15:00.146 --> 01:15:00.907]  Well, let them!
[01:15:01.187 --> 01:15:02.549]  They're the terrorists anyways!
[01:15:02.569 --> 01:15:03.851]  Let's just get it out in the open!
[01:15:04.051 --> 01:15:09.239]  We all know you blew up the towers, you murdering, military-industrial-complex, banker-owned scum!
[01:15:10.689 --> 01:15:30.949]  As Robert Gelanti of Florida State University has highlighted, Germans under Hitler denounced their neighbors and friends not because they genuinely believed them to be a security threat, but because they expected to selfishly benefit from doing so, both financially and socially and psychologically, via a Pavlovian need to be rewarded by their masters for their obedience.
[01:15:31.909 --> 01:15:41.235]  And that's how now you hear ads about report if your boss is pirating software, report if your neighbor spanking their kid was not even legal, report people who are homeschooling.
[01:15:42.216 --> 01:15:46.899]  All of this is about getting social reward or feeling like you've been patted on the head.
[01:15:47.139 --> 01:15:50.742]  In fact, I didn't get into it, but will you guys re-pull the study from yesterday?
[01:15:50.822 --> 01:15:51.803]  Big international...
[01:15:52.843 --> 01:15:53.604]  And major U.S.
[01:15:53.664 --> 01:16:04.033]  University study and concert that found that people will say a barn door is blue if authority figures tell them it's blue, even if the barn door is red.
[01:16:07.558 --> 01:16:12.120]  And, uh, that's what, uh, you know, they have different TV shows illustrating this, how peer pressure works.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:17.262]  And so, people relish calling and tattling on their neighbors.
[01:16:17.282 --> 01:16:19.863]  They get a thrill, like the authority loves them.
[01:16:20.043 --> 01:16:26.466]  Any free society abhors telling on somebody, even if what somebody's doing's wrong.
[01:16:26.926 --> 01:16:29.627]  In the old days, you would just take care of it yourself.
[01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:36.870]  I mean, you know, only the very worst stuff would be reported because people knew how dangerous a snitch society was.
[01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:42.109]  And it goes on through the rest of this.
[01:16:42.129 --> 01:16:44.018]  I mean, this is just classical tyranny.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:49.522]  Let's go ahead and start getting into the rest of the video as I analyze it here.
[01:16:49.762 --> 01:16:55.906]  PrisonPlanet.tv viewers can see it, but we're here critiquing this taxpayer-paid-for propaganda.
[01:16:55.926 --> 01:16:58.568]  We have the video posted up at Infowars.com in our articles.
[01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:00.189]  Let's continue.
[01:17:00.209 --> 01:17:10.676]  You got the black guy calling in the evil white people, and then it cuts to a bunch of shots of news articles of white terrorists in every case, mentally ill provocateurs, or purely staged government ops like McVeigh.
[01:17:11.197 --> 01:17:13.618]  It has animated blue eyes shining.
[01:17:13.979 --> 01:17:15.760]  Oh my gosh, the white devil's gonna get you.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.120]  Here it is.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:20.302]  We're building all third and J speeds.
[01:17:20.362 --> 01:17:22.063]  Don't worry, online security's on it.
[01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:26.024]  It's not easy to put all the pieces together, and we don't expect you to.
[01:17:26.564 --> 01:17:29.106]  That's the job of law enforcement and intelligence analysts.
[01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:29.606]  I hit pause.
[01:17:30.256 --> 01:17:31.517]  I forgot to point this out.
[01:17:32.197 --> 01:17:50.110]  You've got one of the federal and local top police analysts predicting future terror threats, Mr. Farrell, over in England, when he found out it was the government behind 7-7, and he said the new threat, and he brought up that other cases where it was admitted with the British government had staged terror, they fired him.
[01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:54.233]  So see, all they want is little dumbed-down control freaks.
[01:17:54.473 --> 01:17:56.815]  I've tried on air to call Homeland Security to report terror.
[01:17:57.615 --> 01:17:58.336]  Over and over again.
[01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.678]  And the numbers don't work or nobody answers.
[01:18:00.738 --> 01:18:01.458]  It's all fake.
[01:18:01.618 --> 01:18:02.499]  It's all fake.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:19.732]  They use the NSA to spy on people, so in case you find out the government's about the stage of terror attack, or a corporation is, to get naked body scanners in, or whatever the case is, so they can use NSA spying to make sure police don't get alerted and that they can go forward with the bombing.
[01:18:20.493 --> 01:18:21.594]  Let's continue with the video.
[01:18:23.197 --> 01:18:27.398]  But Homeland Security is a shared effort and responsibility for each of us.
[01:18:28.519 --> 01:18:39.002]  When you see things that just don't seem right, that seem somehow out of the ordinary, reporting what you've observed can be invaluable to the work of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
[01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:46.134]  Acts of terrorism against the United States can be large or small.
[01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:50.977]  And we've all seen their horrific images on television.
[01:18:51.017 --> 01:18:55.020]  But terrorist acts don't happen spontaneously.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.302]  Many require some form of planning.
[01:19:00.363 --> 01:19:04.446]  Before they strike, many terrorists watch and study their targets.
[01:19:05.467 --> 01:19:06.087]  Gather information.
[01:19:10.282 --> 01:19:11.223]  Don't worry, that cop will get him.
[01:19:11.543 --> 01:19:18.167]  Yeah, don't videotape TSA grabbing your children.
[01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:21.289]  And rehearse or walk through their plans.
[01:19:32.745 --> 01:19:43.591]  To do this, they may create or change identity documents or badges, and seek to obtain information... Meanwhile, the feds allow the illegals to be above the law... Paul, we're going about to break.
[01:19:44.132 --> 01:19:49.455]  And of course, the feds have been caught over and over again in some DMVs handing out 20, 30,000 fake IDs to illegals.
[01:19:49.895 --> 01:19:52.897]  I mean, every crime they're talking about here is the feds.
[01:19:52.977 --> 01:19:56.299]  They are the drug dealing, murdering scumbags that work for foreign banks.
[01:19:56.319 --> 01:19:57.780]  They're getting ready to blow more stuff up.
[01:19:59.926 --> 01:20:00.406]  Question.
[01:20:00.767 --> 01:20:04.690]  Can functional magnetic resonance imaging be used to read our minds?
[01:20:05.351 --> 01:20:10.776]  Author Jose Calazo answers yes in his two new books, America's New Slavery.
[01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:16.541]  For more than 13 years, author Jose Calazo has been trying to prove that the U.S.
[01:20:16.601 --> 01:20:21.686]  government has the capacity to read a person's thoughts with a revolutionary technology
[01:20:21.986 --> 01:20:28.029]  Known as FMRI, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and there is proof that it exists.
[01:20:28.469 --> 01:20:34.972]  America's New Slavery explores this technology and its many possible applications in national security.
[01:20:35.252 --> 01:20:36.473]  Who has access to it?
[01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:37.953]  How is it being used?
[01:20:38.253 --> 01:20:41.295]  Does America's salvation rest in this technology?
[01:20:41.575 --> 01:20:48.238]  These and many other questions are answered in America's New Slavery, the new books by Jose Collazo.
[01:20:48.678 --> 01:20:53.580]  Available on BN.com, Amazon.com, and Borders.com.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.600]  America's New Slavery.
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.221]  All Americans should be concerned.
[01:20:58.241 --> 01:21:03.263]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:21:03.563 --> 01:21:04.163]  Number one.
[01:21:04.483 --> 01:21:08.467]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:21:08.767 --> 01:21:13.331]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:14.111]  It's true.
[01:21:14.412 --> 01:21:19.816]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:21:20.097 --> 01:21:23.399]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.383]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:21:27.583 --> 01:21:28.143]  Number 4.
[01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:30.745]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:21:31.146 --> 01:21:34.528]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:21:34.828 --> 01:21:35.048]  Number 5.
[01:21:35.609 --> 01:21:39.531]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:21:39.752 --> 01:21:44.535]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:21:44.815 --> 01:21:48.838]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:21:48.978 --> 01:21:50.540]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.861]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:21:58.874 --> 01:22:02.478]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:22:02.799 --> 01:22:06.323]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:22:06.623 --> 01:22:15.414]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.

[01:22:58.646 --> 01:23:01.007]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[01:23:01.168 --> 01:23:06.291]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[01:23:06.491 --> 01:23:16.757]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed Zerodet100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[01:23:17.017 --> 01:23:18.258]  Forget loan modifications.
[01:23:18.318 --> 01:23:24.502]  Zerodet showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[01:23:24.662 --> 01:23:29.948]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages, but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt Program.
[01:23:30.108 --> 01:23:34.092]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[01:23:34.412 --> 01:23:42.821]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt Special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[01:23:42.981 --> 01:23:44.522]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:44.582]  800-477-9256.
[01:23:44.602 --> 01:23:44.803]  That's 800-477-9256.
[01:23:44.823 --> 01:23:45.683]  Or visit www.zerodet100.com.
[01:23:45.723 --> 01:23:47.745]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:47.765 --> 01:23:49.727]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:08.968 --> 01:24:13.212]  Up on InfoWars.com, Paul Watson has shot a special report.
[01:24:13.232 --> 01:24:15.754]  He's a white Al Qaeda operative because he has blue eyes.
[01:24:16.735 --> 01:24:19.077]  A headline, Big Sis Story Goes Viral.
[01:24:20.492 --> 01:24:25.534]  Headline, DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[01:24:26.114 --> 01:24:31.636]  We're going to open the phones up coming up at the balance of the hour specifically on this story.
[01:24:32.176 --> 01:24:40.479]  And I've got some other important news dealing with the UN's green helmets to invade countries for environmental crimes coming up.
[01:24:40.519 --> 01:24:43.820]  But the toll free number to join us on this Thursday edition is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.181]  Now don't screen your calls.
[01:24:49.011 --> 01:24:54.538]  But every week or two, I'll have a time when I say, I want callers who want to talk about this to have a chance to call in.
[01:24:55.259 --> 01:24:56.461]  I don't care what color you are.
[01:24:57.542 --> 01:25:01.568]  I'm sure Arabs and Muslims are tired of being stereotyped as being terrorists.
[01:25:01.948 --> 01:25:03.010]  And well, now it's whitey.
[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:06.021]  So the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:06.381]  800-259-9231.
[01:25:06.401 --> 01:25:14.905]  We'll get you up and on the air coming up in the next couple segments.
[01:25:14.925 --> 01:25:16.825]  In fact, we'll go to your calls right after the break.
[01:25:17.626 --> 01:25:25.229]  But this all coincides with pale male fear-mongering that domestic terrorists are the number one threat.
[01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:27.890]  Militias and Al-Qaeda, they mix them together.
[01:25:28.631 --> 01:25:31.352]  Folks, the redneck militias absolutely hate Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:32.892]  That's like claiming that
[01:25:34.326 --> 01:25:38.310]  That, uh, you know, BLZ Bubz working with Jesus.
[01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:41.673]  I mean, I mean, this is, this is just so ridiculous.
[01:25:42.373 --> 01:25:43.414]  Or that night is day.
[01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:46.817]  But that's what they do in the training manuals, now they're going public.
[01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:53.363]  All the major ROTC training, the Scout Explorers, what do they train in college and in middle school?
[01:25:53.944 --> 01:25:58.448]  And all these programs, kill the militias, kill the gun owners, kill the disgruntled veteran.
[01:25:59.048 --> 01:26:00.629]  You want me to show you the New York Times article?
[01:26:00.929 --> 01:26:01.770]  I can show you a bunch of others.
[01:26:02.891 --> 01:26:03.612]  Let's put that up.
[01:26:03.912 --> 01:26:04.893]  First line of the article.
[01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:07.875]  Explorer scouts train to take on terrorists.
[01:26:08.495 --> 01:26:13.439]  And then the first line is, ah, they train to take on disgruntled Iraq war vets.
[01:26:13.739 --> 01:26:17.542]  And then it shows the photos of them with paintball killing the veterans.
[01:26:18.863 --> 01:26:21.985]  If you got a bird dog, you train it to go after quail.
[01:26:22.106 --> 01:26:24.527]  Or you train it to go after, pick up the dove or the duck.
[01:26:24.928 --> 01:26:27.450]  If you got a coon hound, you train it to go tree a coon.
[01:26:28.476 --> 01:26:32.677]  The military and the police are trained to take on the veterans.
[01:26:32.977 --> 01:26:37.018]  And we've got the training manuals from every stinking federal agency.
[01:26:38.279 --> 01:26:44.321]  ATF, FBI, Federal Marshals, State Police, Homeland Security Master Documents.
[01:26:44.381 --> 01:26:45.341]  I've published them all.
[01:26:46.321 --> 01:26:46.701]  Okay?
[01:26:47.081 --> 01:26:49.782]  I've tried over and over again to call dozens of numbers on air.
[01:26:49.802 --> 01:26:50.302]  You've seen me.
[01:26:50.502 --> 01:26:51.923]  They don't answer the hotlines.
[01:26:52.163 --> 01:26:53.143]  It's all fake!
[01:26:54.764 --> 01:26:55.684]  It's all fake!
[01:26:58.069 --> 01:27:05.057]  There it is, scouts trained to fight terrorists and more, and you scroll down, first paragraph, you can look at the dozens, they've got like twenty-something photos in the gallery.
[01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:13.446]  Ten minutes into an errant mayhem in his town near the Mexican border, a gunman, a disgruntled Iraq war veteran, has already taken two people...
[01:27:14.207 --> 01:27:15.608]  Hostage, see, see, see.
[01:27:16.368 --> 01:27:19.689]  It's casting the vets as killing people.
[01:27:19.729 --> 01:27:21.009]  He's already taken out two people.
[01:27:21.469 --> 01:27:24.090]  One slumped in his desk, the other covered in blood.
[01:27:24.731 --> 01:27:25.491]  It doesn't matter.
[01:27:25.511 --> 01:27:28.892]  The scouts go in and take out that Iraq War veteran scum.
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:32.382]  I mean, this is how they do it!
[01:27:32.922 --> 01:27:37.887]  I've been to the Urban Warfare Drills for 16 years and watched them with Boy Scouts.
[01:27:37.907 --> 01:27:50.297]  This is in Police State 2000, shot in 1998 in Hebron, Maryland, where the police chief comes over with Marines with machine guns, with heavy guns, and says, turn your camera off, you're not taping it.
[01:27:50.658 --> 01:27:52.619]  Well, they had another camera guy who did get it on tape.
[01:27:53.380 --> 01:28:06.890]  It was what looked like 10 to 12 year old groups in little white t-shirts, they can be identified, of Boy Scouts working with the Marines to come out and tell them what guns were in Mommy and Daddy's house.
[01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:08.611]  Oh, this was confirmed!
[01:28:09.795 --> 01:28:11.016]  Now you know why I'm a little freaked out?
[01:28:11.056 --> 01:28:14.237]  No, the government's evil was going to stage terror attacks before 9-11.
[01:28:14.717 --> 01:28:23.321]  Because in all their Rand Corporation public documents, they said they would use terror to destroy the Republic, to destroy our freedoms, to destroy the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:28:23.541 --> 01:28:30.604]  And they are now pell-mell, hyping 24-7 that the terrorists are about to hit everywhere.
[01:28:30.844 --> 01:28:31.264]  Get ready.
[01:28:31.465 --> 01:28:34.246]  Yeah, they're going to hit right when the banks are robbing everybody.
[01:28:34.426 --> 01:28:38.988]  So you'll still put your flag outside and go grovel to government and tattle on your neighbors.
[01:28:40.384 --> 01:28:48.127]  We're going to go out to break here in a minute and come back with your calls, but let's play a little bit more of the TV soap operas they're putting out, demonizing the new white Al Qaeda.
[01:28:48.147 --> 01:28:48.487]  Here it is.
[01:28:49.787 --> 01:28:53.209]  Facilities or procedures can be indicators of terrorism.
[01:28:53.249 --> 01:28:54.069]  Now they're able-whiting.
[01:28:55.359 --> 01:28:57.540]  No, they're whiting!
[01:28:57.560 --> 01:29:00.360]  Oh, she's watching, the Asian woman's watching, whiting.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:00.841]  Oh my gosh, he's white.
[01:29:00.861 --> 01:29:02.081]  She's watching him, don't worry though.
[01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:02.981]  Oh, he left your bag!
[01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:06.282]  Why did she get involved stopping the CPS kidnapping innocent kids?
[01:29:24.941 --> 01:29:28.905]  Reporting suspicious activity should not be based on a person's race.
[01:29:29.225 --> 01:29:29.645]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:29.665 --> 01:29:33.348]  We're gonna go to break and come back here, but the image is it's whitey.
[01:29:34.049 --> 01:29:41.115]  By the way, I've been at the airport and wanting to go throw a water bottle away in the trash and walk 10 feet away from my bag, and it's always women.
[01:29:41.135 --> 01:29:43.697]  They start going... Hey, hey!
[01:29:44.057 --> 01:29:44.958]  The government did it!
[01:29:45.238 --> 01:29:46.519]  Take some more vaccines, lady!
[01:29:46.719 --> 01:29:47.961]  Fill it with cancer viruses!
[01:29:48.221 --> 01:29:49.822]  Give your kids formally a MediCorn syrup!
[01:29:49.842 --> 01:29:50.603]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.103 --> 01:29:52.604]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.616 --> 01:29:56.358]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.341 --> 01:30:02.683]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:30:03.504 --> 01:30:04.425]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:04.765 --> 01:30:08.468]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:08.648 --> 01:30:10.930]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:16.374]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:16.795 --> 01:30:23.040]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:28.985]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:29.405 --> 01:30:33.088]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:30:33.608 --> 01:30:37.612]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:37.892 --> 01:30:43.457]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:43.857 --> 01:30:46.819]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.841]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:49.381 --> 01:30:49.822]  It's here.

[01:31:02.866 --> 01:31:10.333]  Babs, you work a lot with shipping and things are going absolutely nuts with this new Independence Month Patriot Pack that eFoods is giving away.
[01:31:10.634 --> 01:31:14.677]  The way things are going, we're shipping thousands of these great little Patriot Packs out.
[01:31:14.818 --> 01:31:18.881]  Just an example, Sherry from Arkansas made a $1,300 order.
[01:31:19.002 --> 01:31:21.504]  We shipped her five free Patriot Packs, $750 more free food.
[01:31:23.826 --> 01:31:26.848]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[01:31:27.128 --> 01:31:33.953]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country, so for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away a $149 Patriot Pack free.

[01:31:47.159 --> 01:31:50.441]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:31:50.461 --> 01:31:53.422]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:31:53.482 --> 01:31:54.403]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:32:15.441 --> 01:32:18.186]  Well, they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:32:20.089 --> 01:32:22.273]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:32:24.157 --> 01:32:26.300]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:32:28.582 --> 01:32:32.444]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:32:33.184 --> 01:32:37.787]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[01:32:38.247 --> 01:32:40.128]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:41.889]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[01:32:42.169 --> 01:32:44.730]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:51.314]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[01:32:51.694 --> 01:32:53.895]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:32:54.395 --> 01:32:57.617]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[01:33:23.186 --> 01:33:30.948]  So what would a normal American do if they went to urban warfare drills and watched young children training to report on their parents?
[01:33:32.808 --> 01:33:33.469]  You would get upset.
[01:33:33.509 --> 01:33:41.111]  I remember two years ago up in Arcadia, Iowa it was in the newspaper that the local gun shop is going to practice being shut down and raided.
[01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:46.272]  There will then be door-to-door gun confiscation in the town of 700 and they've all agreed to take part.
[01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:48.411]  School children will be helping.
[01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:56.356]  And I came out and said it was a gun confiscation drill, and the paper freaked out on me and said the town's gotten thousands of calls, people are coming here.
[01:33:56.796 --> 01:34:00.298]  Yes, it was going to be a gun confiscation drill, but for Iraq.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:08.703]  And the government just got caught shipping guns into Mexico to blame it on the Second Amendment, red-handed, and they don't even care.
[01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:10.584]  They're still going ahead with the false flag.
[01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:14.287]  It'd be like if they caught the feds that day, red-handed, in Oklahoma City.
[01:34:16.806 --> 01:34:24.590]  And you know there's been more deaths from the 30-something thousand guns they shipped than what died 168 or whatever it was at Oklahoma City.
[01:34:25.891 --> 01:34:27.732]  It'd be like catching them red-handed there.
[01:34:28.132 --> 01:34:30.133]  And now we catch the feds all over the country.
[01:34:30.813 --> 01:34:33.255]  Miami and Chicago.
[01:34:33.855 --> 01:34:34.355]  Everywhere.
[01:34:35.075 --> 01:34:37.937]  Selling guns at low prices.
[01:34:39.117 --> 01:34:40.218]  Fully auto, you name it.
[01:34:40.478 --> 01:34:41.839]  Grenade launchers, whatever you need.
[01:34:42.319 --> 01:34:45.601]  Directly to the drug gangs who are in their employ.
[01:34:46.519 --> 01:34:48.040]  To knock out the other drug gangs.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.301]  It's going on nationwide.
[01:34:50.341 --> 01:34:51.442]  It's not just Mexico.
[01:34:51.962 --> 01:34:56.504]  Of course the Feds run the $500 billion in narcotics money.
[01:34:57.145 --> 01:35:02.207]  Do you think some local zit-faced crack dealer is laundering that money?
[01:35:02.227 --> 01:35:03.828]  $500 billion a year!
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:14.362]  And then the hundreds of billions out of the private prisons, with the slave labor working for 25 cents an hour, displacing all of our jobs.
[01:35:14.782 --> 01:35:16.383]  It's not rocket science.
[01:35:16.603 --> 01:35:18.163]  It's not rocket science.
[01:35:18.464 --> 01:35:19.744]  It's 100% proven.
[01:35:20.484 --> 01:35:34.109]  Now, they're getting all their little spies primed, all their little minions, that if you see somebody leave the bag, you know, on a bench while they go throw something in the trash to panic and start screaming, and, Homeland Security, it's a white guy, put that bag down!
[01:35:38.339 --> 01:35:42.101]  That's why now every major city under federal grants is buying multi-million dollar robots.
[01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:43.142]  Austin just got two of them.
[01:35:43.642 --> 01:35:45.384]  What was it, Lockheed Martin, the last company?
[01:35:45.444 --> 01:35:47.265]  Or was it Northrop Grumman in Austin?
[01:35:48.206 --> 01:36:05.112]  And then now they gotta have something happen, so they find a cardboard box on the side of I-35, blows out of somebody's car, an old mattress, the robot goes up every week, they shot down the highway, the helicopters, and then they blow up the thing claiming they're protecting you, but really it's to create an explosion at a Pavlovian level that that was a bomb.
[01:36:05.812 --> 01:36:11.094]  And they have drills and blow up buses and cars unannounced and say a day later it was just a drill to create the fear.
[01:36:11.274 --> 01:36:13.155]  Did you hear downtown Chicago, a bus flipped today.
[01:36:14.392 --> 01:36:17.494]  You call your family, honey get home, I just blew up a bus a day later.
[01:36:17.594 --> 01:36:18.315]  It was a drill.
[01:36:19.555 --> 01:36:22.217]  Psychological warfare, the homeschoolers being demonized.
[01:36:22.497 --> 01:36:25.319]  Came out in Michigan and a bunch of other states, AP, four years ago.
[01:36:26.132 --> 01:36:27.453]  Nationwide federal grants.
[01:36:28.214 --> 01:36:33.037]  They call the elementary school kids out in the parking lot, and they blow up a bus, an old bus.
[01:36:33.517 --> 01:36:34.418]  Catch it on fire.
[01:36:34.938 --> 01:36:37.680]  I filmed this stuff, by the way, up in Belton, where they did it there as well.
[01:36:38.100 --> 01:36:39.281]  Announced a real terror attack.
[01:36:39.321 --> 01:36:41.263]  We already knew about the drills from our sources.
[01:36:41.303 --> 01:36:41.723]  We were there.
[01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:43.164]  Army came over and threatened us.
[01:36:43.324 --> 01:36:44.025]  You're Jones!
[01:36:44.225 --> 01:36:46.807]  You're the one that taped us on that I-35 checkpoint!
[01:36:46.887 --> 01:36:47.727]  Turn your camera off!
[01:36:47.867 --> 01:36:49.248]  And I said, go ahead and arrest me.
[01:36:49.729 --> 01:36:51.330]  I know it's the government staging the terror.
[01:36:53.208 --> 01:36:54.049]  I'm gonna take this.
[01:36:54.109 --> 01:36:56.170]  I'm gonna show people this is a fake terror attack.
[01:36:57.711 --> 01:36:58.412]  I don't care.
[01:36:58.532 --> 01:36:59.152]  I'm committed.
[01:36:59.172 --> 01:37:00.213]  There's nothing you can do.
[01:37:00.513 --> 01:37:01.694]  I don't care what you do to me.
[01:37:01.754 --> 01:37:07.778]  I'm committed, committed, committed, committed terrorist to bring you to justice and nothing's gonna stop it!
[01:37:09.380 --> 01:37:09.540]  So...
[01:37:11.021 --> 01:37:16.924]  They have these fake terror attacks, and then they blew the bus up and they call the elementary kids out crying.
[01:37:17.124 --> 01:37:23.008]  First the kids are standing around the bus, they catch it on fire, and then men in camo run up and aim guns at the crying children.
[01:37:23.628 --> 01:37:31.432]  It was in the news, began urinating and defecating on themselves, it's done nationwide, saying, we are the homeschool defense league against public education.
[01:37:31.693 --> 01:37:32.713]  We are pro-gun.
[01:37:32.893 --> 01:37:33.854]  We are going to kill you.
[01:37:34.707 --> 01:37:35.247]  Look it up!
[01:37:35.607 --> 01:37:40.248]  That was a hardcore Soviet re-education camp situation.
[01:37:41.108 --> 01:37:43.669]  America is a giant re-education camp.
[01:37:44.449 --> 01:37:44.809]  Okay?
[01:37:45.409 --> 01:37:49.370]  And they leave people like me alone because they know if they kill me it'll only make this a bigger issue.
[01:37:49.770 --> 01:37:50.850]  It'll highlight everything I've said.
[01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:53.431]  Plus, they want to incrementally move.
[01:37:53.491 --> 01:37:58.292]  If I'm deer hunting and some little deer come out, little bucks, 3-4 point, I don't shoot them.
[01:37:59.676 --> 01:38:05.949]  I'm hunting for meat, I shoot a fat young doe, but if I'm, you know, hunting for a rack, I go for, you know, the big ones.
[01:38:07.139 --> 01:38:08.660]  And I let the little bucks go by.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.041]  And I'm a little buck.
[01:38:10.121 --> 01:38:11.562]  They want all of America.
[01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:14.765]  They want all of you forcibly taking their cancer virus vaccines.
[01:38:14.965 --> 01:38:20.089]  They want all of you forcibly giving your kids high fructose corn syrup formula.
[01:38:20.269 --> 01:38:23.791]  They want all of you with lowered IQs and doubling of cancer and diabetes.
[01:38:24.112 --> 01:38:25.713]  They want it and they're gonna get it.
[01:38:26.393 --> 01:38:31.937]  And they don't want to spoil what they're slowly gutting America by smashing me fatter than a pancake.
[01:38:32.158 --> 01:38:33.719]  Sure, they demonize me in the national press.
[01:38:34.952 --> 01:38:35.693]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:38:35.713 --> 01:38:42.459]  I'm going to go to your calls until five after and we've got amazing guests, actors, TV hosts, comedians in here that are Obama lovers.
[01:38:42.919 --> 01:38:44.060]  And we're going to talk about it.
[01:38:44.761 --> 01:38:45.462]  We're going to talk about it.
[01:38:45.482 --> 01:38:47.023]  It's going to be a very interesting discussion.
[01:38:47.063 --> 01:38:48.404]  One of them is a 9-11 truth or so.
[01:38:49.525 --> 01:38:50.386]  Maybe both of them, I don't know.
[01:38:50.406 --> 01:38:51.587]  But we're going to be talking to them in here.
[01:38:52.028 --> 01:38:52.728]  Give you their names.
[01:38:52.989 --> 01:38:55.591]  Hal Sparks, when you see him, you'll know who he is.
[01:38:56.011 --> 01:38:57.993]  And Richard Hunter, radio talk show host and comedian.
[01:38:59.048 --> 01:39:00.429]  Jaren set them up, I think it's interesting.
[01:39:00.849 --> 01:39:14.838]  Okay, I want to go to your calls, but first I want to briefly here remind listeners that we will be launching the Daily TV Show probably at 7 o'clock every evening.
[01:39:16.058 --> 01:39:22.302]  It's taped to air at first, it'll go live later, but we'll tape it right before like it's live and then stream it out to PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[01:39:22.742 --> 01:39:27.966]  Next week, I think it'll be Thursday, 7 o'clock, I'm going to do an hour, just a roundtable discussion show.
[01:39:28.866 --> 01:39:30.347]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:39:30.387 --> 01:39:33.769]  So if you haven't signed up for 15 cents a day for PrisonPlanet.TV, now's the time.
[01:39:34.049 --> 01:39:38.772]  We also stream the live radio show via TV when you're a member.
[01:39:39.592 --> 01:39:40.913]  And your membership supports us.
[01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:42.994]  We can expose these murdering terrorists.
[01:39:43.254 --> 01:39:45.776]  They're using scientific control to totally manipulate everybody.
[01:39:45.936 --> 01:39:47.337]  But once you know the trick, jigs up.
[01:39:48.557 --> 01:39:50.978]  And so I hope you'll sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:51.078 --> 01:39:54.319]  And lastly, I want to tell you about PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:39:54.799 --> 01:39:55.539]  Made in America.
[01:39:55.839 --> 01:39:56.980]  Super high quality filters.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.721]  If you want to formally remove fluoride from your tap water, visit PureWaterFreedom.com.
[01:40:00.741 --> 01:40:02.461]  They have a full line of household fluoride filters.
[01:40:02.741 --> 01:40:04.982]  You can even remove fluoride from every water source in your home.
[01:40:05.222 --> 01:40:05.362]  Okay.
[01:40:28.436 --> 01:40:36.759]  Or just trust the government and drink the tap water, fill the radioactive isotopes, sodium, fluoride, nickel, mercury, arsenic, and hundreds of other deadly toxins put in there on purpose, on record.
[01:40:37.159 --> 01:40:39.820]  Now, I want to say this again and I'm going to your calls.
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:45.102]  They are priming everybody for domestic soft terror attacks all over the country.
[01:40:45.871 --> 01:40:51.514]  And they're gonna hop up, drug-head white people, blacks, Muslims, you name it, claim they're linked up together.
[01:40:51.914 --> 01:40:58.537]  In some cases, they'll have contractors kill people, they'll shoot a patsy in the head, like Harrison Kleibold, and say that's what happened.
[01:40:58.817 --> 01:40:59.598]  They're getting ready.
[01:41:00.058 --> 01:41:07.822]  You wonder how the government's gonna get its banking raping through, how it's gonna get its police state through, how they're gonna get the 9% approval rating for Congress up.
[01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:14.245]  Look at all the Democratic operatives that have written memos to Obama saying, you need a 9-11 or Oklahoma City, that will help you.
[01:41:16.769 --> 01:41:20.532]  I'm telling you, they're getting ready, and they're getting ready to unleash white Al Qaeda.
[01:41:21.152 --> 01:41:23.734]  It'll be as phony as a $3 bill, but they don't care.
[01:41:24.234 --> 01:41:28.257]  Only exposing the terror attacks and taking that tool away from them is going to defeat them.
[01:41:28.497 --> 01:41:30.039]  And they're hopping mad, people, now.
[01:41:30.519 --> 01:41:34.802]  Every time there's a new terror attack, look around and watch and see what's happening.
[01:41:34.882 --> 01:41:38.104]  Our listeners caught the underwear bomber being brought on the plane by the U.S.
[01:41:38.124 --> 01:41:38.425]  government.
[01:41:39.045 --> 01:41:40.946]  And it came out to be true a month and a half later.
[01:41:41.687 --> 01:41:43.028]  So we're watching you, murderers.
[01:41:43.368 --> 01:41:45.490]  The real patriots are watching and listening.
[01:41:46.226 --> 01:41:47.087]  And they know who to watch.
[01:41:47.808 --> 01:41:49.070]  They know who to watch.
[01:41:49.531 --> 01:41:50.693]  Private contractors.
[01:41:51.274 --> 01:41:52.275]  They know who to watch.
[01:41:52.315 --> 01:41:53.036]  The FBI.
[01:41:53.136 --> 01:41:54.038]  We know who to watch.
[01:41:54.298 --> 01:41:55.900]  The Foreign Intelligence Services.
[01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:56.561]  Mossad.
[01:41:57.042 --> 01:41:57.583]  MI6.
[01:41:58.484 --> 01:41:59.365]  We know who to watch.
[01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:00.507]  We're watching you.
[01:42:00.607 --> 01:42:01.529]  Don't you worry.
[01:42:01.809 --> 01:42:03.130]  You want to get us watching each other?
[01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:05.771]  We're watching you, and you don't like that, do you?
[01:42:05.811 --> 01:42:09.473]  You don't want people discussing that government staged terror throughout history.
[01:42:09.713 --> 01:42:13.015]  Your little treat, your little jig is up, murderers.
[01:42:13.555 --> 01:42:15.376]  Because a lot of us don't care what you do to us.
[01:42:15.717 --> 01:42:17.658]  We're totally committed because we know you're murderers.
[01:42:17.958 --> 01:42:22.260]  And we know there's no future if we don't stop you murdering, control freak eugenics filth.
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.582]  Okay, Maggie in California, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:42:26.411 --> 01:42:26.971]  Thank you.
[01:42:26.991 --> 01:42:37.154]  Um, I went to the, uh, Drudge Report, and I clicked on the DHS link, and I got about five and a half minutes into it, and I was horrified.
[01:42:37.874 --> 01:42:39.174]  Everything you said was true.
[01:42:40.094 --> 01:42:43.475]  So I called Senator Lieberman's office, who is the chairman.
[01:42:43.495 --> 01:42:44.855]  Oh, the Mossad officer?
[01:42:45.796 --> 01:42:48.536]  And I got nothing, no response.
[01:42:48.656 --> 01:42:50.797]  I mean, it was just, whatever, lady.
[01:42:51.417 --> 01:42:55.618]  And so I called my own congressman's office, and not much better response.
[01:42:56.434 --> 01:42:58.876]  And I thought, you know, one person can't do it.
[01:42:59.616 --> 01:43:02.919]  But I explained that crime is not a color.
[01:43:03.799 --> 01:43:10.724]  And why aren't you focusing on the 99.9% of the terrorists that are attacking everyone in the world?
[01:43:12.125 --> 01:43:17.169]  And I just, my encouragement to everyone listening is look at the report.
[01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:23.713]  Look at the video, look at the history, and start calling everybody you can think of to call.
[01:43:23.833 --> 01:43:24.273]  Exactly.
[01:43:24.313 --> 01:43:29.175]  Let me add this, because let's just say the Muslims did 9-11 and NORAD stood down and the Easter Bunny's real.
[01:43:29.695 --> 01:43:33.497]  Why in the internal manuals is it all about non-Muslims?
[01:43:33.857 --> 01:43:40.140]  Why did the head of Homeland Security a month ago, Mr. Napolitano, why did he say, I mean, she say that
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:46.764]  That the number one threat is domestics, and that it was illogical to profile and focus on Muslims.
[01:43:47.085 --> 01:43:51.808]  If the Muslims really did 9-11, and this is all for 9-11, well then why is it for everybody?
[01:43:52.268 --> 01:43:54.009]  Because... I'm sorry ma'am, go ahead.
[01:43:54.770 --> 01:44:02.215]  No, you're making valid points, and I go back to that Missouri report, the DHS connected thing several years ago.
[01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:10.041]  Everybody in there was a Christian, or a Second Amendment, or a Libertarian,
[01:44:10.994 --> 01:44:13.535]  And those are the core values of America.
[01:44:14.655 --> 01:44:18.457]  And it seems like anything... My father was a paratrooper.
[01:44:18.537 --> 01:44:23.018]  He jumped out of perfectly good airplanes in Germany in World War II.
[01:44:23.378 --> 01:44:25.839]  So I was raised to love my country.
[01:44:26.359 --> 01:44:28.660]  And I am horrified at what I'm seeing.
[01:44:28.780 --> 01:44:34.122]  Well, you love the troops and the old America that was good, but America's had a corporate takeover happen.
[01:44:34.582 --> 01:44:43.335]  And so of course they're destroying everything that is the spirit of the United States and then wrapping their tyranny in the flag and hoping to confuse people.
[01:44:43.375 --> 01:44:44.396]  But folks are waking up.
[01:44:45.418 --> 01:44:47.621]  If everybody calls...
[01:44:48.653 --> 01:44:52.696]  Maybe we can, I don't know, maybe I believe in the Tooth Fairy 2.
[01:44:52.916 --> 01:44:53.216]  No, no, no.
[01:44:53.276 --> 01:44:59.261]  I think it's good to call them and let them know it's a scam, but also let other people know it's a scam and get the article out to everybody.
[01:44:59.301 --> 01:45:00.041]  Good job, Maggie.
[01:45:00.342 --> 01:45:01.903]  Now this story has gone mega viral.
[01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:04.244]  It is on thousands of news sites now.
[01:45:04.365 --> 01:45:09.028]  I mean, this is going to be one of the biggest reports we ever put out, because folks are finally getting it.
[01:45:09.068 --> 01:45:10.009]  I told you this was coming.
[01:45:10.029 --> 01:45:10.629]  Thank you, Maggie.
[01:45:11.089 --> 01:45:12.530]  Kate in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.911]  Go ahead.
[01:45:14.284 --> 01:45:21.838]  Hey Alex, I know it's no laughing matter, but I just want to say I could listen to you for three hours doing voiceovers with videos like this.
[01:45:21.878 --> 01:45:22.759]  It's hilarious, man.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:26.500]  Well, it is hilarious if it wasn't so dangerous.
[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:27.341]  I mean, they're getting ready.
[01:45:27.361 --> 01:45:30.961]  I mean, they're not saying TSA is going to be on the streets for nothing.
[01:45:30.981 --> 01:45:36.342]  They're going to start blowing stuff up and then saying, we're allowed to be anywhere and stick our hands down your pants anywhere.
[01:45:36.362 --> 01:45:43.343]  And they're announcing they're going to start groping genitals at malls, on the sides of highways, taking blood under federal grants without warrants.
[01:45:43.624 --> 01:45:44.964]  They want in your person.
[01:45:45.244 --> 01:45:47.164]  They want to touch you without warrants.
[01:45:47.444 --> 01:45:48.564]  They want in your life.
[01:45:49.985 --> 01:45:50.305]  Sure.
[01:45:50.345 --> 01:45:51.725]  I mean, the writing on the wall is
[01:45:52.256 --> 01:45:55.318]  Pretty transparent for anyone that is awake to see.
[01:45:56.038 --> 01:46:14.287]  What I fear is, and I hope it's not the vast majority, but I hope the, I fear that the vast majority of people will not be able to see through this and actually get into such a, you know, a frenzy of fear and think that they can call the terrorists and report terrorism.
[01:46:14.307 --> 01:46:19.149]  Uh, and when, you know, a house divided amongst itself cannot stand and
[01:46:20.695 --> 01:46:36.165]  When the excrement hits the fan, which I feel like you that it will eventually, regardless of its terrorism or if it's financial terrorism, I just think that people divided and arguing amongst each other is going to be the biggest obstacle that
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.002]  We, and when I say we, the enlightened, the people that can... The awakened.
[01:46:41.302 --> 01:46:42.042]  Well, no, you're right.
[01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:58.890]  We had so much liberty that we became decadent and slovenly, and now a lot of spoiled rotten Americans have got a rude awakening coming, and it's going to be staged terror along with financial terror, because they're going to want to make you rally around the terrorists who will claim they're protecting you.
[01:46:59.270 --> 01:47:03.372]  So I'm telling you, you can see all the prescripting, just like we saw before 9-11.
[01:47:03.732 --> 01:47:06.093]  They're getting ready to pull the trigger.
[01:47:06.673 --> 01:47:08.378]  And it is going to be hellish.
[01:47:11.866 --> 01:47:12.849]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:12.929 --> 01:47:13.570]  Anything else, Tate?
[01:47:14.471 --> 01:47:24.196]  No, but I just encourage everyone, like you said, to call, like the woman, the previous caller just said, or just get the word out as best you can, and that's all we can do.
[01:47:24.456 --> 01:47:29.118]  But I appreciate your patriotism, Alex, and God bless, and have a good rest of the day.
[01:47:29.238 --> 01:47:31.219]  Well, thank you, Tate, but it's not even patriotism.
[01:47:31.299 --> 01:47:32.440]  I love the old republic.
[01:47:32.480 --> 01:47:33.940]  I love what America really stands for.
[01:47:34.100 --> 01:47:35.541]  It isn't perfect, but it's heads above.
[01:47:36.161 --> 01:47:39.663]  It's a million miles better than anything else we've seen in the world.
[01:47:39.963 --> 01:47:40.703]  I've studied history.
[01:47:40.864 --> 01:47:41.244]  It works.
[01:47:41.344 --> 01:47:41.724]  It's great.
[01:47:41.764 --> 01:47:43.385]  We've gotten away from it, so it's not working.
[01:47:43.985 --> 01:47:46.206]  It's like 93 octane gas works great in your car.
[01:47:46.226 --> 01:47:47.867]  If you put water in it, it's not going to work.
[01:47:48.468 --> 01:47:51.569]  You don't put water in your car and then it doesn't start and you blame gasoline for it.
[01:47:51.869 --> 01:47:55.351]  They're blaming the Constitution when the Constitution isn't being put in the engine.
[01:47:57.773 --> 01:48:01.975]  I want to go back to Janice and Jeannie and Mike and Mark and others here in a moment.
[01:48:02.255 --> 01:48:05.536]  But folks, I'm not just saying this for theatrics.
[01:48:06.456 --> 01:48:08.637]  The bankers have gang-riped us financially.
[01:48:08.657 --> 01:48:10.338]  They're imploding the country by design.
[01:48:10.778 --> 01:48:15.659]  And they've set up an architecture, a police state against the American people built around terror.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:19.061]  And they have to provide that terror
[01:48:20.197 --> 01:48:24.279]  As Governor Ridge admitted, to get you to politically rally around them.
[01:48:24.799 --> 01:48:27.360]  So they're getting ready, okay?
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:31.302]  They're getting ready to stage terror attacks and blame it on the American people.
[01:48:32.942 --> 01:48:34.403]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:48:34.463 --> 01:48:35.824]  Janice in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:48:35.864 --> 01:48:36.264]  Go ahead.
[01:48:36.284 --> 01:48:37.925]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:38.185 --> 01:48:40.206]  So glad you're talking about this today.
[01:48:40.326 --> 01:48:43.407]  For the past, like, three months, they've been advertising this
[01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:50.404]  Oh yeah, no, no.
[01:48:51.185 --> 01:49:02.857]  They mirror this in propaganda placement all over the sitcoms, the dramas, the action shows, where the terrorists are guys that believe in chemtrails and fluoride in the water, and then they try to murder everybody in the city.
[01:49:03.077 --> 01:49:03.918]  No, exactly.
[01:49:03.958 --> 01:49:04.558]  It's everywhere.
[01:49:04.819 --> 01:49:05.359]  It's everywhere.
[01:49:05.379 --> 01:49:05.900]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:06.598 --> 01:49:06.878]  I don't
[01:49:26.483 --> 01:49:28.385]  Oh, I need to spy on him, they're saying.
[01:49:28.425 --> 01:49:32.147]  And there's this, like, Alan Watts-type character who's saying, oh, you can't do that.
[01:49:32.167 --> 01:49:33.648]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:49:33.688 --> 01:49:36.150]  And she's going, no, we'll get hit.
[01:49:36.270 --> 01:49:37.091]  We'll get hit.
[01:49:37.551 --> 01:49:38.572]  And they... Exactly.
[01:49:38.612 --> 01:49:40.753]  The Constitution's gonna make the terrorists hit us.
[01:49:40.953 --> 01:49:41.874]  We've gotta get rid of it.
[01:49:41.914 --> 01:49:43.415]  We've gotta get your bank accounts, I mean.
[01:49:43.635 --> 01:49:44.796]  Keep you safe from Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:45.897 --> 01:49:47.438]  Again, I can't even watch TV.
[01:49:47.578 --> 01:49:48.158]  It's in the...
[01:49:49.479 --> 01:49:59.784]  Sometimes my wife watches these medical shows and dramas and things, and I'll watch it with her, and it's just, she goes, look at this, every episode, pro-abortion, every episode, the bad guy talks about freedom.
[01:50:00.104 --> 01:50:00.844]  No, they're getting ready.
[01:50:00.924 --> 01:50:02.325]  We are the terrorists, okay?
[01:50:02.605 --> 01:50:09.548]  I mean, in all the internal manuals, it is the veterans, the gun owners, and it's the veterans and the gun owners going, get them Arabs!
[01:50:09.788 --> 01:50:10.949]  Take their rights away!
[01:50:11.269 --> 01:50:13.931]  Not knowing the whole thing's always been for them.
[01:50:13.951 --> 01:50:17.153]  And then I see these conservatives go, well, it's Obama doing this now.
[01:50:17.273 --> 01:50:17.513]  No.
[01:50:17.993 --> 01:50:20.014]  Obama, Bush, they read off teleprompters.
[01:50:20.255 --> 01:50:21.215]  They don't run Jack.
[01:50:21.395 --> 01:50:26.959]  This is a long-term, strategic, Pentagon, Rand Corporation, full-spectrum dominance takeover.
[01:50:28.319 --> 01:50:30.761]  Well, it's called Homeland, and they are after the vets.
[01:50:31.741 --> 01:50:33.503]  Oh, the veterans are terrorists on the show.
[01:50:35.664 --> 01:50:38.586]  And Claire Danes is the only FBI woman who knows.
[01:50:39.392 --> 01:50:41.253]  Stay there, tell me more about the shows that you've seen.
[01:50:41.273 --> 01:50:46.936]  On my TV show, I need people to send in clips of this to us, because I can't watch it.
[01:50:47.276 --> 01:50:54.480]  I'm going to show clips from sitcoms, dramas, cop shows, because every time I turn TV on and catch one, it's, he believes the government's putting stuff in the vaccines.
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:55.721]  He also rapes children.
[01:50:55.741 --> 01:50:59.143]  I mean, it's just pure demonization, because we know they're the terrorists.

[01:51:29.131 --> 01:51:30.212]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:51:30.372 --> 01:51:34.755]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:51:34.935 --> 01:51:40.659]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:51:40.759 --> 01:51:44.161]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:51:44.401 --> 01:51:47.003]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:51:47.123 --> 01:51:52.026]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:51:52.186 --> 01:51:52.407]  Call 800-686-2237.

[01:51:59.352 --> 01:52:01.675]  They helped to create a new world order.
[01:52:01.755 --> 01:52:03.918]  We are part of a new world order.
[01:52:03.938 --> 01:52:06.882]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[01:52:07.282 --> 01:52:12.009]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:52:12.389 --> 01:52:16.575]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:52:16.875 --> 01:52:19.198]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:52:19.218 --> 01:52:21.762]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:52:22.122 --> 01:52:24.685]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:52:25.026 --> 01:52:32.636]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:52:32.955 --> 01:52:38.237]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:52:38.357 --> 01:52:40.618]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:52:40.658 --> 01:52:44.640]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:45.800]  And I got news for you.
[01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:47.261]  You're everyone else.
[01:52:47.301 --> 01:52:48.341]  Invisible Empire.

[01:54:01.919 --> 01:54:07.562]  Yeah, I've seen the trailer for Homeland.
[01:54:08.422 --> 01:54:09.342]  And it's too painful.
[01:54:09.602 --> 01:54:13.244]  I should watch more mainline TV because I always get energized.
[01:54:14.224 --> 01:54:15.645]  Because we watch very little TV.
[01:54:15.725 --> 01:54:17.766]  Sometimes late at night we'll turn something on.
[01:54:18.826 --> 01:54:27.050]  And it's just all... If you don't trust the government, if you love freedom, you're murdering children in your basement, you're planning to buy a weapon, New York.
[01:54:27.950 --> 01:54:30.391]  And it's like every show I turn on.
[01:54:31.519 --> 01:54:38.882]  And you've got these arrested development child-like people watching it, who really believe this is real!
[01:54:40.222 --> 01:54:42.423]  Who really believe Obama launched peace in Libya.
[01:54:42.683 --> 01:54:45.084]  Who really believe he can do whatever he wants without Congress.
[01:54:45.584 --> 01:54:48.185]  Who really believe George W. Bush found WMDs in Iraq.
[01:54:48.206 --> 01:54:55.168]  You know, 54% in major polls of American conservatives believe WMDs were found in Iraq, even though it's admitted they weren't.
[01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:58.369]  Though I've predicted for years they're going to roll them out later like bin Laden.
[01:54:58.389 --> 01:54:59.370]  I know how they work.
[01:55:00.543 --> 01:55:01.223]  I know how they work.
[01:55:02.304 --> 01:55:05.725]  And why am I risking my life to bring you this information?
[01:55:05.805 --> 01:55:08.867]  Because there's no future for anybody if these people win.
[01:55:08.887 --> 01:55:12.668]  Do you understand these aren't some boss hog tyrants that just want to rob stuff?
[01:55:13.569 --> 01:55:14.809]  These are eugenicists.
[01:55:15.209 --> 01:55:16.830]  Their religion is the status god.
[01:55:17.150 --> 01:55:22.973]  Their religion is set up world government, cut off resources, and end the family as it's known.
[01:55:24.423 --> 01:55:25.024]  I'm resisting them.
[01:55:25.164 --> 01:55:26.545]  I'm all in, totally committed.
[01:55:26.965 --> 01:55:28.126]  People say, don't you have bodyguards?
[01:55:28.146 --> 01:55:29.447]  Don't you worry when you walk around at night?
[01:55:29.547 --> 01:55:29.728]  No.
[01:55:29.748 --> 01:55:31.009]  I don't worry about none of it.
[01:55:31.549 --> 01:55:31.889]  Whatever.
[01:55:31.909 --> 01:55:32.610]  It's in God's hands.
[01:55:33.171 --> 01:55:36.233]  I'm fighting total murdering scum who's stage 9-11.
[01:55:36.533 --> 01:55:39.116]  You think I'm going to just sit here and cower because they're killers?
[01:55:40.316 --> 01:55:47.061]  If you don't admit that government sponsoring terror, and that our government isn't our government anymore, it's been taken over, America will die.
[01:55:47.501 --> 01:55:49.103]  Liberty Worldwide will die.
[01:55:49.683 --> 01:55:53.045]  They are going to use staged terror to destroy every basic freedom.
[01:55:53.266 --> 01:55:54.386]  I got a stack of news here.
[01:55:54.807 --> 01:56:02.833]  We're in Florida, they're illegally selling your driver's license data and personal info to anybody that wants it, making 63 million a year, and it's illegal and they don't care.
[01:56:03.673 --> 01:56:08.277]  That cops have got scanners tracking people everywhere they go in the cities, and that it's illegal.
[01:56:09.266 --> 01:56:14.229]  What type of society are we creating as civil rights lawyer Harvey Silvergate, along with the ACLU?
[01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:21.633]  The Big Brother database that could map drivers whereabouts with police cruiser mounted scanners that capture thousands of license plates.
[01:56:21.653 --> 01:56:22.494]  It's already in everywhere.
[01:56:22.514 --> 01:56:26.056]  It's already in on those cameras on the polls, folks.
[01:56:26.416 --> 01:56:30.359]  It was in 15 years ago in almost every area of the country, starting in Indiana and Texas.
[01:56:31.019 --> 01:56:34.361]  Police to begin iPhone iris scans amid privacy concerns.
[01:56:34.581 --> 01:56:35.482]  You want me to keep going here?
[01:56:37.651 --> 01:56:46.357]  Oh, Austin just published the 10 water wasters, the private citizens that waste too much water, publicly pilloring them for their environmental crimes.
[01:56:46.637 --> 01:56:51.920]  Meanwhile, the globalists are GMO, engineering every major crop on record to sterilize us.
[01:56:52.541 --> 01:56:53.861]  That's not an environmental crime, though.
[01:56:54.102 --> 01:57:01.346]  Somebody having a broken water pipe under their house for a month, they need to get published in the paper, just like people that have concealed carries get published in the paper.
[01:57:03.348 --> 01:57:06.450]  If you don't wake up to these crooks,
[01:57:07.369 --> 01:57:08.409]  That are out of control.
[01:57:08.429 --> 01:57:10.150]  They're not going to let you plant a garden in your front yard.
[01:57:10.810 --> 01:57:11.390]  Already happened.
[01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:13.070]  They're not going to let you have a garden in your backyard.
[01:57:13.090 --> 01:57:14.911]  They're not going to let you pack your child's school lunch.
[01:57:15.351 --> 01:57:17.831]  The federal courts have already ruled your children aren't yours.
[01:57:17.851 --> 01:57:18.451]  They're the state's.
[01:57:19.192 --> 01:57:19.612]  Don't believe me?
[01:57:19.652 --> 01:57:20.452]  Just search that term.
[01:57:20.792 --> 01:57:24.353]  These people... Folks, tyranny is the norm worldwide.
[01:57:24.413 --> 01:57:25.353]  We got a case of it.
[01:57:25.633 --> 01:57:29.734]  A bad case in the 21st century making it particularly nasty.
[01:57:31.775 --> 01:57:38.339]  Janice, we're going to break here in a moment, but finish up the show Homeland, where the vets are all terrorists, the conservatives are terrorists.
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:39.000]  Go ahead.
[01:57:40.097 --> 01:57:55.240]  They find this guy in Iraq, they blow something up and he's in a cave and he's like, I'm American, he's this red-haired, light blue-eyed guy, and Claire Danes is like, on this FBI mission to go after every POW because they've been turned.
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:59.621]  You can't go to Iraq and fight for your country without coming back and being a terrorist.
[01:57:59.661 --> 01:58:01.042]  Which is totally made up!
[01:58:01.362 --> 01:58:06.103]  They have taught all the police departments in the country on our homeland security, starting three years ago,
[01:58:07.063 --> 01:58:10.467]  That IEDs will attack even your small town.
[01:58:10.527 --> 01:58:11.828]  It will be vets that do it.
[01:58:12.049 --> 01:58:15.052]  They're teaching police to have a purge of the military.
[01:58:15.232 --> 01:58:17.935]  I'm sorry, and the TV show is simulating this for folks?
[01:58:17.975 --> 01:58:18.596]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:58:19.196 --> 01:58:23.060]  Oh, totally not even... Let me guess, does he IED people?
[01:58:23.201 --> 01:58:24.242]  Because that's what they teach the cops.
[01:58:25.017 --> 01:58:29.622]  Yes, and they're trying to tell her not to do it, and she's like, I know he turned.
[01:58:29.942 --> 01:58:30.923]  I've got to get him.
[01:58:30.943 --> 01:58:32.565]  She's in his phone.
[01:58:32.585 --> 01:58:34.026]  She's got a telescope.
[01:58:34.046 --> 01:58:35.728]  She's just after him.
[01:58:35.828 --> 01:58:37.930]  And let me guess, he is a terrorist in the end?
[01:58:40.853 --> 01:58:42.715]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.376 --> 01:58:46.539]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:49.295 --> 01:58:53.538]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:53.838 --> 01:58:54.118]  Number 1.
[01:58:54.758 --> 01:58:57.900]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:58.181 --> 01:58:58.741]  Number 2.
[01:58:59.041 --> 01:59:03.604]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:03.944 --> 01:59:04.385]  It's true.
[01:59:04.685 --> 01:59:09.248]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:09.548 --> 01:59:10.088]  Number 3.
[01:59:10.388 --> 01:59:13.670]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:13.971 --> 01:59:17.653]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:17.873 --> 01:59:18.414]  Number 4.
[01:59:18.654 --> 01:59:21.016]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:21.417 --> 01:59:24.800]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.101 --> 01:59:25.321]  Number 5.
[01:59:25.901 --> 01:59:29.806]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:30.046 --> 01:59:34.811]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:35.091 --> 01:59:39.112]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.252 --> 01:59:40.813]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.033 --> 01:59:43.133]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[01:59:45.894 --> 01:59:47.255]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:47.275 --> 01:59:53.157]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:04.028 --> 02:00:08.211]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:08.851 --> 02:00:09.652]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.433 --> 02:00:11.433]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:11.994 --> 02:00:15.616]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.177 --> 02:00:20.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.881 --> 02:00:28.746]  Alright, short little five minute segment.
[02:00:29.955 --> 02:00:36.381]  And, uh, the manuals for a decade have been the veterans are gonna get you, the conservatives, the libertarians, the gun owners, the farmers.
[02:00:36.401 --> 02:00:37.222]  We gotta arrest them.
[02:00:37.242 --> 02:00:39.864]  Marines training to mow down farmers.
[02:00:39.945 --> 02:00:40.805]  I've been to the drills.
[02:00:41.366 --> 02:00:43.948]  Children training to go in their parents' houses and get their guns.
[02:00:43.988 --> 02:00:46.471]  We've got the footage of the drills and it being admitted.
[02:00:46.511 --> 02:00:49.714]  Marines coming up with guns in Maryland saying, turn your cameras off.
[02:00:50.674 --> 02:00:51.355]  It's all confirmed.
[02:00:51.975 --> 02:00:56.298]  A giant, secret build-up, bigger than the Cold War, against the American people.
[02:00:57.119 --> 02:00:59.901]  And the government is run by criminals, they're gonna stage terror attacks to get it done.
[02:01:00.501 --> 02:01:11.750]  And every sitcom, drama, cop show I watch, randomly, you turn it on, there's a guy going, there's chemtrails, they're spraying, they're weather modifying, and then he goes down to a dungeon with little kids he's torturing.
[02:01:12.290 --> 02:01:14.532]  The message is, you're into chemtrails, you're torturing kids.
[02:01:15.192 --> 02:01:15.893]  Next episode,
[02:01:16.573 --> 02:01:19.676]  There's a guy who's worried about vaccines killing people.
[02:01:20.076 --> 02:01:22.137]  He plans to release a bioweapon in New York.
[02:01:23.118 --> 02:01:27.522]  He's warning you about a bioweapon in the vaccines where governments have been caught over and over again.
[02:01:27.902 --> 02:01:29.003]  He's the one that's going to do it.
[02:01:29.643 --> 02:01:31.665]  And yes, they've had nationwide training for three years.
[02:01:31.725 --> 02:01:33.466]  Cops everywhere hearing this are going, how does he know it?
[02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:36.088]  Because I get all the documents from cops that aren't idiots.
[02:01:37.028 --> 02:01:37.708]  And they're training them.
[02:01:37.848 --> 02:01:40.469]  Veterans will attack your police station.
[02:01:41.309 --> 02:01:45.710]  Every place in the country will be attacked with improvised explosive devices.
[02:01:46.150 --> 02:01:48.211]  And I asked Janice, she was talking about the show Homeland.
[02:01:48.231 --> 02:01:49.411]  I haven't seen it, I've seen the trailer.
[02:01:49.991 --> 02:01:53.552]  And I said, let me guess, the veterans they're tracking are going to have IEDs to kill cops.
[02:01:53.912 --> 02:01:55.392]  And she says, yes, that's the episode.
[02:01:55.692 --> 02:01:56.293]  I already know.
[02:01:56.693 --> 02:01:57.473]  I know the script.
[02:01:58.053 --> 02:02:02.254]  They're teaching everyone that if you're not an idiot and you own guns, you're the enemy.
[02:02:03.274 --> 02:02:05.395]  Because the foreign banks are going to gang-rape America.
[02:02:05.735 --> 02:02:09.996]  And they're not going to let scumbag armed Americans that know they're the enemy get in their way.
[02:02:10.016 --> 02:02:10.897]  Okay?
[02:02:11.477 --> 02:02:13.358]  Now, you can wake up to this, or you can't.
[02:02:13.898 --> 02:02:15.698]  If you don't wake up, they're going to have their way with you.
[02:02:16.239 --> 02:02:21.741]  Janice, finishing up the show about the evil veterans that are the real Al-Qaeda we've now got to face.
[02:02:23.041 --> 02:02:30.004]  Well, the big question that hangs in my mind is that if POWs are so bad, then why aren't they arresting John McCain, who wants 100 years of war?
[02:02:31.843 --> 02:02:33.084]  You know, I mean, hello.
[02:02:34.324 --> 02:02:35.325]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:02:35.505 --> 02:02:39.186]  Well, that's because they already know they're taking all the pension funds and pay and health care from the vets.
[02:02:39.967 --> 02:02:42.708]  And they're going to go after the vets.
[02:02:43.208 --> 02:02:44.989]  It's freedom, though.
[02:02:45.229 --> 02:02:46.410]  And say, why are you doing this?
[02:02:46.890 --> 02:02:48.311]  Because she's proud of it.
[02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:51.812]  She's like on, you know, talking about, you know, the behind the scenes.
[02:02:51.832 --> 02:02:53.773]  She's like, I know this dirty veteran's a terrorist.
[02:02:54.013 --> 02:02:55.454]  And he does turn out to be one, correct?
[02:02:56.286 --> 02:02:56.486]  Yes.
[02:02:56.607 --> 02:02:56.907]  Of course.
[02:02:57.808 --> 02:03:00.232]  And he stares at the Capitol with the hoodie.
[02:03:00.392 --> 02:03:02.195]  You know, they always have to have hoodies on.
[02:03:02.255 --> 02:03:03.476]  Yeah, but he's the guy, too.
[02:03:03.517 --> 02:03:05.359]  You said he talks about the Constitution a lot.
[02:03:05.379 --> 02:03:08.383]  And you said there's an Alan Watt conspiracy type guy, right?
[02:03:08.404 --> 02:03:09.145]  They always have that guy.
[02:03:09.659 --> 02:03:10.219]  That's her boss.
[02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:12.261]  He tells her not to do it.
[02:03:12.301 --> 02:03:13.762]  He's like, you can't do it.
[02:03:13.822 --> 02:03:14.642]  You can't do it.
[02:03:14.702 --> 02:03:16.564]  He, you know, it's against the Constitution.
[02:03:16.584 --> 02:03:18.585]  She goes, but we have to save our country.
[02:03:18.605 --> 02:03:22.768]  Well, it's like all those shows where the heroes are the torturers under Bush.
[02:03:22.808 --> 02:03:27.691]  And then we find out they're raping small children in Abu Ghraib with giant objects dripping with battery acid.
[02:03:27.971 --> 02:03:30.133]  And the good old boys are like, it's of the Lord.
[02:03:30.533 --> 02:03:32.014]  Jesus would approve of that.
[02:03:32.314 --> 02:03:34.296]  And then now the Obama people are like, yeah, let's do it.
[02:03:34.316 --> 02:03:34.896]  Let's get tough.
[02:03:35.116 --> 02:03:38.619]  Because the new TV ads are Whitey's the terrorist and we're going to get him.
[02:03:39.797 --> 02:03:44.039]  See, for conservatives, we're going to get brown people, and they go, yeah, let's get them brown people.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:46.541]  And then for the liberals, we're going to get whitey.
[02:03:47.121 --> 02:03:49.182]  And what's the story?
[02:03:49.482 --> 02:03:55.045]  One lady could eat no lean, and the other guy could eat no fat, but between the two, they lick the platter clean?
[02:03:56.766 --> 02:03:57.507]  Nursery rhyme.
[02:03:57.827 --> 02:03:59.348]  Yeah, I think I got it backwards.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:01.861]  Yeah, something like that.
[02:04:02.021 --> 02:04:03.842]  It's just it's so horrific, Alex.
[02:04:03.982 --> 02:04:05.002]  It is just horrific.
[02:04:05.423 --> 02:04:07.143]  I've never seen such horror in my life.
[02:04:07.764 --> 02:04:11.966]  And Claire Danes, I mean, she's always been like an OK actress.
[02:04:11.986 --> 02:04:15.648]  You know, I haven't like disliked her, but for her to play along with something like that.
[02:04:15.708 --> 02:04:21.349]  Don't worry, they've got movies coming out that the flu's coming and you're gonna fight for that special vaccine.
[02:04:21.810 --> 02:04:26.411]  They admit the last vaccine killed a bunch of people and doubled your chances of catching the flu next time.
[02:04:26.431 --> 02:04:29.492]  Just search H1N1 shot double chances of getting next flu.
[02:04:29.812 --> 02:04:30.832]  Destroys immune system.
[02:04:31.392 --> 02:04:33.533]  Look up in the testing of it at one hospital.
[02:04:33.553 --> 02:04:37.094]  31 homeless died from the shot.
[02:04:37.134 --> 02:04:38.334]  Guillain-Barré's is exploding.
[02:04:39.554 --> 02:04:41.656]  You go to a shopping mall and look at most little kids now.
[02:04:41.676 --> 02:04:43.358]  They look like they've been hit with a mutation ray.
[02:04:44.058 --> 02:04:45.720]  Brain degenerative diseases are off the chart.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.782]  Cancer has doubled in the last 10 years, and so has diabetes.
[02:04:47.982 --> 02:04:48.983]  But everything's good.
[02:04:49.203 --> 02:04:49.964]  Take those shots.
[02:04:50.264 --> 02:04:50.985]  Eat the GMO.
[02:04:51.225 --> 02:04:52.266]  Do what the government tells you.
[02:04:52.447 --> 02:04:53.448]  Believe the television.
[02:04:53.808 --> 02:04:54.649]  It's so good!
[02:04:54.669 --> 02:04:57.011]  We'll be right back with some good Obama supporters.
[02:04:57.291 --> 02:04:58.112]  Good Americans!
[02:04:58.132 --> 02:04:58.212]  Yeah!
[02:05:00.165 --> 02:05:14.621]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:05:15.642 --> 02:05:19.306]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:20.327 --> 02:05:32.317]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:05:33.078 --> 02:05:40.343]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:05:41.044 --> 02:05:50.631]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[02:06:00.253 --> 02:06:01.755]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:01.975 --> 02:06:07.001]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:06:07.281 --> 02:06:08.643]  Saving means to make money.
[02:06:08.823 --> 02:06:17.593]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:06:18.334 --> 02:06:25.438]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:06:25.858 --> 02:06:33.462]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:06:33.863 --> 02:06:38.785]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:06:58.906 --> 02:07:00.047]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:07:00.067 --> 02:07:06.731]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:07:06.991 --> 02:07:09.272]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:07:09.533 --> 02:07:14.736]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:07:14.916 --> 02:07:17.697]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:07:17.978 --> 02:07:20.019]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:07:20.279 --> 02:07:26.203]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:07:26.524 --> 02:07:29.726]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:07:29.906 --> 02:07:35.430]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:37.011]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:07:37.331 --> 02:07:38.492]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:07:38.632 --> 02:07:41.134]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:07:41.294 --> 02:07:45.337]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:07:45.517 --> 02:07:50.001]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:50.141 --> 02:07:52.603]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:07:52.723 --> 02:07:56.425]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:07:56.606 --> 02:07:57.686]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:05.891]  Essentially, let me start from the beginning because this is a lot of stuff.
[02:08:05.931 --> 02:08:12.772]  You have a real issue with the fact when there's 19 hijackers that put up on the website and like 5 or 7 of them are still alive.
[02:08:12.792 --> 02:08:13.992]  They're still alive!
[02:08:14.433 --> 02:08:15.033]  Absolutely!
[02:08:15.073 --> 02:08:18.213]  So that, in and of itself, grinds your story to a halt.
[02:08:18.353 --> 02:08:20.534]  Grinds the official story to a halt.
[02:08:20.714 --> 02:08:21.034]  Right.
[02:08:21.094 --> 02:08:23.194]  Building 7, there's no way that building wasn't detonated.
[02:08:23.254 --> 02:08:23.894]  Everybody knows it.
[02:08:23.934 --> 02:08:24.895]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[02:08:25.095 --> 02:08:31.376]  Except for the people who, from an architectural standpoint or an engineering point of view, just go, there's no other way this building came down.
[02:08:31.836 --> 02:08:34.298]  If nothing fell on it, there was not enough fire.
[02:08:34.478 --> 02:08:34.959]  End of story.
[02:08:34.999 --> 02:08:36.079]  Buildings don't fall like that.
[02:08:36.159 --> 02:08:37.200]  That's just stupid.
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:37.921]  Absolutely.
[02:08:38.101 --> 02:08:49.870]  From that point of view, then you have to, just on those two bases alone, the fact that the people they said that actually caused it, some of them are still alive, that all of them are Saudi,
[02:08:50.850 --> 02:08:53.291]  You know, and none of them were from Afghanistan or Iraq.
[02:08:53.351 --> 02:08:53.852]  Right, right.
[02:08:53.912 --> 02:08:56.393]  Why were you invading Iraq and Afghanistan?
[02:08:56.433 --> 02:08:57.193]  Well, different reasons.
[02:08:57.213 --> 02:09:08.819]  We were invading Iraq because, you know, we set that guy up, he was one of our sort of CIA stooges for a long time, and he was going to monetize, he was going to change the money in the oil trade from dollars to euros.
[02:09:09.199 --> 02:09:15.182]  And at the talk of that, the euro went from 61 cents to over a dollar, and then we went into Iraq like that.
[02:09:15.942 --> 02:09:22.806]  Afghanistan's similar problems except for, you know, there's a natural gas pipeline they're going to put through there, there's an oil pipeline, and there's gold in the hills.
[02:09:22.866 --> 02:09:23.707]  Nobody talks about that.
[02:09:23.947 --> 02:09:27.669]  But there's gold in those Tora Bora hills where they're always talking, why don't we just nuke that whole area?
[02:09:27.729 --> 02:09:31.251]  Well, because there's a lot of gold in there, you know, and that's what we're in there getting out right now.
[02:09:31.511 --> 02:09:34.772]  And there, of course, is the opium trade that we're also... Right.
[02:09:34.912 --> 02:09:40.135]  But that's, quite frankly, that's the fast food element of it.
[02:09:40.395 --> 02:09:42.555]  The drug trade is the least of it.
[02:09:42.976 --> 02:09:46.357]  And considering that, without that money, it wouldn't prop up our entire government half the time.
[02:09:46.657 --> 02:09:49.898]  Drug money actually saved this country, largely, during the crash.
[02:09:50.018 --> 02:09:54.880]  I mean, there was an exchange of like $500 million that was constantly shifting through.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:55.721]  It was all drug money.
[02:09:56.021 --> 02:09:57.862]  And everybody knew it, and they just kind of took a back seat.
[02:09:58.302 --> 02:10:00.723]  Less enforcement, because without it, that money would have
[02:10:01.663 --> 02:10:02.604]  Yank some banks dead.
[02:10:02.984 --> 02:10:05.305]  You've got all that stuff going on.
[02:10:05.485 --> 02:10:08.266]  You have a responsibility, I think, to at least look deeper.
[02:10:08.286 --> 02:10:10.607]  You don't have to go all the way down the rabbit hole with some people.
[02:10:10.667 --> 02:10:13.609]  You also can't stick your head in the sand and act like it's not.
[02:10:13.629 --> 02:10:15.650]  So, other than that, I have no opinion.
[02:10:17.691 --> 02:10:23.233]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:10:23.693 --> 02:10:26.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:28.135 --> 02:10:32.217]  Alright, for the rest of the hour, Jared has landed us quite the guest today.
[02:10:32.237 --> 02:10:47.703]  I mean, as big as Greg Kinnear or bigger, we've got Hal Sparks, you name it, every TV show on the planet, host of TalkSoup for two years, CSI crime scene investigation, Las Vegas, Celebrity Paranormal Project, I mean, it goes on for ten hours.
[02:10:48.623 --> 02:10:52.185]  Hal Sparks has got his Charmageddon stand-up special.
[02:10:53.365 --> 02:10:55.287]  Coming... It's out now.
[02:10:55.507 --> 02:10:57.829]  You can buy it on Amazon if you so choose.
[02:10:58.109 --> 02:10:58.569]  Awesome.
[02:10:58.730 --> 02:10:59.690]  Or stream it or whatever.
[02:11:00.111 --> 02:11:04.013]  And a Dallas radio host, who I've been on his show many times, Richard Hunter.
[02:11:04.874 --> 02:11:07.076]  And it's richardhuntershow.com.
[02:11:07.796 --> 02:11:13.821]  Of course, halsparks.com is the website for Hal, who I called Richard earlier, even though I know they both are.
[02:11:13.841 --> 02:11:16.062]  You guys look a lot alike, minus the long hair.
[02:11:16.203 --> 02:11:17.003]  It's true.
[02:11:17.123 --> 02:11:17.664]  A little bit.
[02:11:17.704 --> 02:11:19.285]  And at times, he's had the same hair.
[02:11:19.465 --> 02:11:20.267]  It's true, it's true.
[02:11:20.287 --> 02:11:21.188]  Yeah, I used to have long hair.
[02:11:21.208 --> 02:11:23.533]  I only cut it so they wouldn't keep getting us mixed up.
[02:11:23.633 --> 02:11:27.861]  It looks like a cross between Nikki Sixx and Al Qaeda.
[02:11:28.121 --> 02:11:28.402]  Yeah.
[02:11:29.103 --> 02:11:29.303]  Yeah.
[02:11:30.066 --> 02:11:35.151]  Yeah, I think that's what landed me on the watch list and VH1's all-time null basis.
[02:11:35.271 --> 02:11:46.040]  I always think it's funny when TSA pulls aside anybody who looks alternative lifestyle-y, like tattoos or whatever, because those folks are the least threat out there.
[02:11:46.281 --> 02:11:52.626]  White guy in khakis, I'm worried about, because he may have nothing to live for and decide to kill himself and take a bunch of people with him just because he wants to be famous.
[02:11:52.646 --> 02:11:53.928]  There's a lot of those guys in history.
[02:11:54.508 --> 02:11:58.010]  But the guy with a lot of tattoos has sex to have where he's going.
[02:11:58.030 --> 02:11:59.011]  He has drugs to do.
[02:11:59.071 --> 02:12:00.732]  He's not going to kill anybody on the plane.
[02:12:00.752 --> 02:12:02.693]  He wants to get where he's going to do the damage.
[02:12:02.993 --> 02:12:04.374]  He's not going to die mid-air.
[02:12:04.434 --> 02:12:05.394]  That makes no sense.
[02:12:05.954 --> 02:12:06.155]  Yeah.
[02:12:06.375 --> 02:12:06.835]  Theoretically.
[02:12:06.875 --> 02:12:07.775]  Very Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:12:08.216 --> 02:12:08.476]  Yeah.
[02:12:08.576 --> 02:12:12.118]  Gentlemen, tell us why you are here in the illustrious city of Austin.
[02:12:12.498 --> 02:12:19.741]  Well, we're at Cap City Comedy this weekend, you know, brightening the lives of groups of 300 or more at a time.
[02:12:19.781 --> 02:12:20.902]  Tonight through Saturday.
[02:12:20.962 --> 02:12:21.282]  Yeah.
[02:12:21.322 --> 02:12:23.283]  Capcitycomedy.com for tickets.
[02:12:23.543 --> 02:12:23.763]  Yes.
[02:12:24.123 --> 02:12:25.043]  That's a nice place.
[02:12:25.304 --> 02:12:25.564]  It is.
[02:12:25.644 --> 02:12:26.024]  It's great.
[02:12:26.164 --> 02:12:30.246]  It looks a bit like the top part of a roller rink where they serve the nachos.
[02:12:30.266 --> 02:12:35.188]  You ever go to a roller rink and they have that really thin carpet and, you know, easy to clean?
[02:12:35.768 --> 02:12:36.388]  That kind of stuff.
[02:12:36.929 --> 02:12:38.789]  The club looks like that part of the, yeah.
[02:12:38.829 --> 02:12:40.090]  Well, it's actually very palatial.
[02:12:40.630 --> 02:12:46.875]  Yeah, well, it's got that weird iron structure that looks like two rewind and fast-forward buttons attached to it.
[02:12:46.895 --> 02:12:48.277]  I don't know what the design thought was.
[02:12:48.317 --> 02:12:49.718]  I think it was just there and they built around it.
[02:12:49.838 --> 02:12:53.501]  It basically looks like a refabbed cruise ship from the 1980s.
[02:12:53.581 --> 02:12:55.342]  Sure, or a strip club now.
[02:12:55.883 --> 02:12:58.805]  Yeah, without, you know, obviously a different form of entertainment.
[02:12:58.865 --> 02:13:00.026]  I did some stand-up there once.
[02:13:00.046 --> 02:13:00.947]  Almost caused a riot.
[02:13:01.167 --> 02:13:01.508]  Oh yeah?
[02:13:01.628 --> 02:13:01.788]  Yeah.
[02:13:02.348 --> 02:13:04.389]  Is this the infamous Doug Stanhope?
[02:13:04.409 --> 02:13:04.689]  Yeah.
[02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:05.809]  Oh yeah, that's where that was.
[02:13:05.849 --> 02:13:13.331]  There were some troops in the front row, and they'd like me talking about Gulf of Tonkin being staged, and they said, we're gonna kick your butt, and I said, get on up here, I'm gonna stomp all three of you.
[02:13:13.691 --> 02:13:15.632]  And whether or not I was gonna win the fight, I was ready to go.
[02:13:15.652 --> 02:13:16.272]  They backed off.
[02:13:16.492 --> 02:13:16.812]  Sure, Doug.
[02:13:16.832 --> 02:13:18.132]  It was a good thing, because I'm actually a coward.
[02:13:18.433 --> 02:13:18.953]  Yeah, well.
[02:13:19.013 --> 02:13:20.413]  It was all a complete hoax.
[02:13:20.453 --> 02:13:21.073]  Bluff, yeah.
[02:13:21.093 --> 02:13:21.933]  It was bluff, yeah.
[02:13:22.014 --> 02:13:23.234]  You have a great voice for bluffing.
[02:13:23.674 --> 02:13:24.134]  Exactly.
[02:13:24.174 --> 02:13:24.354]  You do.
[02:13:24.414 --> 02:13:26.075]  You got that kind of voice.
[02:13:26.115 --> 02:13:27.135]  If you have, and if you're like,
[02:13:27.688 --> 02:13:30.530]  Uh, anybody who wants to come up here, I will take everybody on.
[02:13:30.550 --> 02:13:31.090]  They would have come.
[02:13:31.210 --> 02:13:31.790]  They would have brought it.
[02:13:32.391 --> 02:13:39.594]  But, since you were up there going... Anybody who wants to, you know, they'll... Truth is, I had a diaper on and was, like, scared and... Crapping yourself.
[02:13:39.715 --> 02:13:39.935]  Yes.
[02:13:40.035 --> 02:13:40.195]  Right.
[02:13:40.555 --> 02:13:41.536]  I totally understand.
[02:13:41.556 --> 02:13:42.976]  That may be happening right now.
[02:13:43.136 --> 02:13:44.737]  Alright, I get bad when I get around comedians.
[02:13:44.757 --> 02:13:45.978]  I apologize to the family audience.
[02:13:46.178 --> 02:13:47.159]  We're going to stop right there.
[02:13:47.179 --> 02:13:47.679]  That's right.
[02:13:47.719 --> 02:13:48.499]  Or start right there.
[02:13:48.539 --> 02:13:54.903]  Before I get into 9-11 truth and both your views on that, we just played a clip of Hal Sparks talking about that a moment ago.
[02:13:54.923 --> 02:13:56.484]  Let's get Richard Hunter's take on it.
[02:13:56.884 --> 02:13:59.906]  I want to talk about Lord Obama.
[02:14:00.386 --> 02:14:02.687]  The second coming, they said he actually could be the Christ.
[02:14:02.967 --> 02:14:04.868]  They compared him to Christ in the news.
[02:14:04.968 --> 02:14:05.349]  Who did that?
[02:14:06.349 --> 02:14:10.211]  It's in my film, The Obama Deception, mainstream news saying that he was being compared to Christ.
[02:14:10.431 --> 02:14:10.591]  Right.
[02:14:10.651 --> 02:14:12.852]  He was going to give us free houses, free cars, fix everything.
[02:14:13.232 --> 02:14:18.874]  Now he says that, his Treasury Secretary, that it's going to be the most painful thing in our lives and last for a long time.
[02:14:19.295 --> 02:14:20.295]  That doesn't sound too good.
[02:14:20.935 --> 02:14:24.517]  Are you guys happy as Obama supporters about the peace action in Libya?
[02:14:25.497 --> 02:14:29.900]  Uh, or about them putting even more Muslim extremists in when they kicked Mubarak out in Egypt.
[02:14:29.980 --> 02:14:32.843]  Are you happy about the expansion of wars and torture?
[02:14:32.923 --> 02:14:34.424]  I mean, love, peace?
[02:14:34.904 --> 02:14:36.785]  I mean, what's your view on Lord Obama?
[02:14:36.965 --> 02:14:39.427]  Or would that be heresy if you talk bad about him?
[02:14:39.447 --> 02:14:40.708]  Because you're both smart guys.
[02:14:40.728 --> 02:14:42.970]  I mean, you have courage, Hal, talking about the 9-11 issue.
[02:14:43.390 --> 02:14:43.850]  Absolutely.
[02:14:45.031 --> 02:14:55.701]  I actually think, in so far as politics in modern America, and in any major advanced society, you're going to at least have to build some walls before you put the roof on.
[02:14:55.741 --> 02:14:58.684]  And I think a lot of times, policy-wise, we look for the roof first.
[02:14:59.264 --> 02:14:59.664]  I think so.
[02:15:20.973 --> 02:15:23.235]  Well, their breast cancer is off the charts.
[02:15:23.255 --> 02:15:26.599]  Those vaccines are really helping, so is the birth control.
[02:15:26.619 --> 02:15:31.363]  Of course, they know it really increases the breast cancer, but don't worry, under health care, they're going to give it to them free.
[02:15:31.383 --> 02:15:37.229]  Plasticizing agents in drinking water are one of the big reasons why people have an increased amount of breast cancer in their system.
[02:15:37.289 --> 02:15:37.890]  That's a big one.
[02:15:37.970 --> 02:15:38.791]  Yeah.
[02:15:39.291 --> 02:15:40.633]  It hyper-feminizes women.
[02:15:41.133 --> 02:15:51.896]  The movement against clean drinking water since the 1970s has actually driven more people to drink bottled water, and that over time has led to a raise in that.
[02:15:51.936 --> 02:15:57.138]  The paranoia about drinking your own tap water, that is honest to some degree.
[02:15:57.158 --> 02:16:09.802]  I don't know if it's related directly to the fluoride aspect of things, but the fact is that the anti-government kind of anti-we're-not-all-in-this-together group has been really against purifying the drinking water, making sure it's actually clean.
[02:16:10.022 --> 02:16:10.602]  So there's all these
[02:16:10.862 --> 02:16:11.122]  No problem.
[02:16:11.162 --> 02:16:13.863]  There's too much garbage in the tap water therefore it's better to drink bottled water.
[02:16:13.923 --> 02:16:17.825]  And that movement towards fear and towards bottled water has actually led to the higher cancer rates in a lot of people.
[02:16:35.213 --> 02:16:39.854]  Now see Hal, I'm going to be honest with you, that is completely insane what you just said.
[02:16:39.874 --> 02:16:45.015]  It is on record that sodium, no I'm not debating bisphenol A, I know.
[02:16:45.355 --> 02:16:47.836]  I was called a conspiracy theorist ten years ago for talking about it.
[02:16:48.156 --> 02:16:52.697]  I'm not debating, it's mainly the stuff you microwave, it's in the other plastic containers, it's in everything.
[02:16:52.857 --> 02:16:54.677]  It's in the liners of tin cans.
[02:16:54.777 --> 02:17:01.278]  But what I'm telling you is, because one thing's bad doesn't mean the other thing's good, what I'm saying is, it's on record.
[02:17:01.318 --> 02:17:01.999]  And vice versa.
[02:17:02.019 --> 02:17:03.699]  Do you know what sodium fluoride does to you?
[02:17:04.079 --> 02:17:06.360]  Yeah, believe me, I'm not a pro-fluoride guy.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:07.781]  I'm saying that actually should be out of there.
[02:17:07.801 --> 02:17:09.302]  Seven-fold increase in bone cancer.
[02:17:09.322 --> 02:17:09.862]  Absolutely.
[02:17:10.402 --> 02:17:19.187]  What I'm saying is, there was a movement in the 1970s where they're like, H2O, we need to clean the water as much as we can, just base water, no fluoride, no nothing.
[02:17:19.247 --> 02:17:19.567]  I agree.
[02:17:19.727 --> 02:17:21.068]  And that got hammered.
[02:17:21.568 --> 02:17:32.495]  Largely by the rate of what became the Reagan base in the eighties to a move towards you know what government should be out of the water business altogether and private industry moved in and started taking over utilities in mass in the eighties.
[02:17:32.515 --> 02:17:33.756]  And then you get toilet to tap.
[02:17:34.076 --> 02:17:34.597]  Absolutely.
[02:17:34.897 --> 02:17:42.522]  And then so people in fear of that went to plastic bottled water and then the cancer rate spiked directly related to that.
[02:17:42.582 --> 02:17:46.985]  So yes I'm anti-fluoride and I don't think there should be anything in water but H2O.
[02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.986]  You should come out of your tap as pure as possible.
[02:17:49.026 --> 02:17:49.767]  The problem is
[02:17:50.447 --> 02:17:57.392]  This idea that, hands off, no EPA, I don't want anybody, no government bureaucrat... Wait a minute, it's the EPA that wants the fluoride in there?
[02:17:57.512 --> 02:18:08.980]  Well, no, that now, but there was a movement in the 70s for the EPA to be very pure, but once... Here's the thing, you can't say an organization in government is bad inherently because it's been...
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:11.561]  Staffed by people who hate it to start with.
[02:18:11.581 --> 02:18:12.722]  Let me stop you right there.
[02:18:12.782 --> 02:18:13.762]  Let me stop you right there.
[02:18:13.982 --> 02:18:15.723]  You're all liberal conservative.
[02:18:15.763 --> 02:18:16.564]  I'm way past all that.
[02:18:16.584 --> 02:18:17.204]  I see what you're saying.
[02:18:18.205 --> 02:18:19.906]  Over 90%... Does it not have worth?
[02:18:20.086 --> 02:18:20.626]  No, no, no.
[02:18:20.746 --> 02:18:27.730]  Over 90% of the EPA scientists in 2000, 2005, and then again last year, wrote letters to their bosses saying...
[02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:30.772]  Take the fluoride, take the other toxins out of the water.
[02:18:30.832 --> 02:18:31.392]  This is bad.
[02:18:31.472 --> 02:18:33.093]  I know there were good people in government.
[02:18:33.494 --> 02:18:35.195]  I know there's a lot of good people in government.
[02:18:35.215 --> 02:18:35.375]  Okay.
[02:18:36.295 --> 02:18:37.396]  But they're compartmentalized.
[02:18:37.496 --> 02:18:40.859]  It's the directors on top that are the eugenicists.
[02:18:41.039 --> 02:18:45.542]  Well, yeah, and the committee chairmen who make sure that that's who gets to the top of the organization.
[02:18:45.962 --> 02:18:52.627]  The problem is when you have guys who are essentially inherently anti-government, they have no impetus for a system to actually work to the benefit of the people.
[02:18:53.287 --> 02:19:03.351]  And when you have a profit-based psychology in both business and in government, you have only a monetary view of what profit totally is.
[02:19:03.391 --> 02:19:03.932]  It's more than that.
[02:19:03.972 --> 02:19:04.532]  It's crony.
[02:19:04.592 --> 02:19:05.773]  It's insiders run the system.
[02:19:05.793 --> 02:19:06.253]  That's what I mean.
[02:19:06.273 --> 02:19:08.494]  Those guys think in terms of cash profit.
[02:19:08.514 --> 02:19:15.997]  And the profit of a country, the profit that comes off the top, what a country takes in profit as its business... You're talking about short-term.
[02:19:16.577 --> 02:19:17.578]  No, I'm talking long-term.
[02:19:17.778 --> 02:19:19.059]  I mean, they're doing short-term looting.
[02:19:19.079 --> 02:19:19.939]  I'm not talking about cash.
[02:19:20.019 --> 02:19:22.761]  I'm talking about the health and happiness of the American people.
[02:19:22.861 --> 02:19:25.563]  It's the actual profit you make from your industry.
[02:19:25.723 --> 02:19:27.704]  What we look at is we have a business-government industry.
[02:19:27.724 --> 02:19:31.246]  It takes my taxes and it doesn't, and it's always running at a deficit.
[02:19:31.707 --> 02:19:34.408]  On a cash level, this is what we're saying it's based on.
[02:19:34.428 --> 02:19:38.591]  We're saying, like, FEMA or the EPA or any of these groups,
[02:19:39.211 --> 02:19:44.277]  They're taking my tax dollars and I don't know where it's going and I don't want any benefit from it.
[02:19:44.357 --> 02:19:46.860]  I don't see any benefit from it because it's taking my money and not going anywhere.
[02:19:47.361 --> 02:19:49.923]  The benefit comes from the health and happiness of the American people.
[02:19:50.204 --> 02:19:51.745]  The problem is... Hey, I agree with you.
[02:19:51.785 --> 02:19:53.027]  Government makes the sun shine.
[02:19:53.628 --> 02:19:54.909]  Hal Sparks is our guest.
[02:19:54.969 --> 02:19:55.550]  Richard Hunter.
[02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:57.051]  We're going to come back after break.
[02:19:57.252 --> 02:19:58.573]  I know they make the grass grow.
[02:19:58.633 --> 02:19:59.014]  I got it.
[02:20:01.564 --> 02:20:02.684]  This is not a drill.
[02:20:02.784 --> 02:20:04.745]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[02:20:05.285 --> 02:20:06.885]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[02:20:07.185 --> 02:20:14.307]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:14.407 --> 02:20:18.748]  Now a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters.
[02:20:18.788 --> 02:20:29.130]  You'll learn step-by-step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns.
[02:20:29.790 --> 02:20:30.851]  Any circumstance.
[02:20:30.931 --> 02:20:37.815]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:38.155 --> 02:20:38.815]  But listen up.
[02:20:38.835 --> 02:20:45.039]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[02:20:45.099 --> 02:20:46.900]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:49.021]  That's hideyourguns.com.

[02:21:00.433 --> 02:21:04.054]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:04.454 --> 02:21:07.455]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:07.695 --> 02:21:12.476]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:12.496 --> 02:21:18.697]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:18.877 --> 02:21:21.118]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:21:21.638 --> 02:21:21.938]  Tim Geithner?
[02:21:21.958 --> 02:21:22.398]  Bernanke?
[02:21:22.478 --> 02:21:23.098]  They're arsonists!
[02:21:23.138 --> 02:21:24.519]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:24.539 --> 02:21:26.679]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:40.563 --> 02:21:42.404]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:42.704 --> 02:21:47.446]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:21:47.826 --> 02:21:56.950]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:22:28.331 --> 02:22:29.413]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:29.573 --> 02:22:33.958]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:34.138 --> 02:22:39.866]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[02:22:39.966 --> 02:22:43.330]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:46.471]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:24:12.737 --> 02:24:22.582]  Well, we've got radio talk show host Richard Hunter in here, also comedian, and we've got Hal Sparks, who's been on every TV show in the galaxy, but I think the biggest one is Talk Soup.
[02:24:22.622 --> 02:24:27.205]  That's actually a show I've watched over the years, whenever I do see it on, and he was one of the better hosts of it.
[02:24:27.585 --> 02:24:30.427]  Okay, so you're here in Austin, Cap City Comedy Club the next three nights.
[02:24:30.967 --> 02:24:32.268]  Let's get back to where we were.
[02:24:32.408 --> 02:24:34.989]  Richard Hunter had a comment about, quote, the problem with the left.
[02:24:35.309 --> 02:24:35.970]  My issue is,
[02:24:37.185 --> 02:24:38.226]  I'm not into left and right.
[02:24:38.466 --> 02:24:39.466]  I don't like these labels.
[02:24:39.506 --> 02:24:42.247]  I've got to be for this issue from the right and this issue from the left.
[02:24:42.588 --> 02:24:43.708]  I'm into common sense.
[02:24:44.128 --> 02:24:45.529]  I'm into history.
[02:24:45.829 --> 02:24:46.590]  I'm into freedom.
[02:24:47.010 --> 02:24:49.171]  I'm part of the freedom group.
[02:24:49.931 --> 02:24:55.394]  Here was the point on my own radio show in 2008 when we covered the presidential election.
[02:24:55.874 --> 02:25:18.745]  I thought it was great to see so many young people get involved for the first time and all that sort of thing and they were a lot of my listeners but I'm somebody who's been politically active since I was 10 years old so I felt like I had something to say to these people and what I was trying to tell them was great that you got involved but the biggest mistake you're gonna make right now because you're new to the process is to say oh great my guy won I'll see you in four years.
[02:25:19.025 --> 02:25:19.345]  I think so.
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:41.861]  They're going to listen to somebody else's special interest.
[02:25:41.881 --> 02:25:43.462]  You made a great point about special interest.
[02:25:43.482 --> 02:25:49.706]  What it really is, is deciding whose special interest I can suffer more than someone else.
[02:25:49.766 --> 02:25:54.209]  And there's these big roving gangs of corporate special interests that are bigger than most governments.
[02:25:54.269 --> 02:25:54.409]  Right.
[02:25:54.809 --> 02:25:58.131]  And they're going to buy Republican Democrats, so how do you deal with them?
[02:25:58.291 --> 02:26:01.494]  Well, ultimately, you need giant government.
[02:26:01.534 --> 02:26:02.756]  You don't even need big government.
[02:26:02.796 --> 02:26:05.539]  You need government that is only about the big things.
[02:26:06.259 --> 02:26:08.782]  Protecting you from a giant country that's going to attack you.
[02:26:09.162 --> 02:26:10.224]  Large hurricanes.
[02:26:10.304 --> 02:26:12.386]  That's the kind of government I'm interested in.
[02:26:12.466 --> 02:26:14.208]  I don't need social architecture government.
[02:26:14.568 --> 02:26:18.073]  I don't need government telling me how to live on a day-to-day basis, per se.
[02:26:18.493 --> 02:26:25.723]  But if a large corporation is putting a toxin in the food supply, I need a very large government.
[02:26:25.763 --> 02:26:29.047]  But our government's run by eugenicists that are actually putting the toxins in the food supply.
[02:26:29.386 --> 02:26:32.328]  Well, I wouldn't say everybody in the government's a eugenicist.
[02:26:32.488 --> 02:26:36.472]  I mean, I think that... Folks, have you seen Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement?
[02:26:36.512 --> 02:26:36.972]  Yes, I have.
[02:26:36.992 --> 02:26:37.252]  You have?
[02:26:37.432 --> 02:26:38.073]  Of course I have.
[02:26:38.093 --> 02:26:39.174]  Blair, have another copy.
[02:26:39.214 --> 02:26:39.674]  Watch it again.
[02:26:39.714 --> 02:26:40.455]  I'm gonna take his.
[02:26:40.475 --> 02:26:41.015]  Yeah, he'll take it.
[02:26:41.095 --> 02:26:41.616]  Absolutely.
[02:26:41.636 --> 02:26:43.217]  You wanna see Moffa 21, Black Genocide?
[02:26:43.237 --> 02:26:43.857]  No, that's okay.
[02:26:44.198 --> 02:26:48.421]  I've watched most of these, I'm sorry to say, for free on the internet.
[02:26:48.961 --> 02:26:52.084]  I know this is a... I know paranoia is a great dollar industry.
[02:26:52.104 --> 02:26:53.325]  It really always has been.
[02:26:53.425 --> 02:26:53.865]  No, wait a minute.
[02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:55.627]  I get my stuff out for free and promote it's free.
[02:26:56.247 --> 02:26:57.608]  But we do have to fund ourselves.
[02:26:57.728 --> 02:26:58.188]  No, I get it.
[02:26:58.208 --> 02:27:01.290]  In fact, folks, he's attacking the funding by the motion videos right now.
[02:27:01.891 --> 02:27:03.692]  We're building a new TV studio over there.
[02:27:03.832 --> 02:27:08.655]  Yeah, buy a copy of Charmageddon and watch it before and after just so that you don't, you know, hole up in a bunker.
[02:27:09.075 --> 02:27:12.017]  We're not hole up in a bunker, we're storming the Texas Capitol.
[02:27:12.938 --> 02:27:13.118]  Why?
[02:27:13.158 --> 02:27:15.479]  We're out in the open, we're taking America back.
[02:27:15.499 --> 02:27:17.501]  You're in an unmarked building in an office park.
[02:27:18.446 --> 02:27:21.888]  That's because of fans.
[02:27:22.528 --> 02:27:23.569]  We have to get work done.
[02:27:24.829 --> 02:27:26.990]  And they would interrupt?
[02:27:27.010 --> 02:27:27.831]  Yes.
[02:27:28.851 --> 02:27:32.713]  I don't doubt it because they have all kinds of like large loose-leaf binders full of stuff.
[02:27:32.813 --> 02:27:34.334]  And also women.
[02:27:34.374 --> 02:27:36.815]  And I say no, but some of the crew has a problem.
[02:27:37.875 --> 02:27:41.417]  Oh yeah, that explains the sales force here that I've seen.
[02:27:41.437 --> 02:27:43.599]  They look a little too busy to sell anything.
[02:27:43.619 --> 02:27:45.860]  No wonder you're handing stuff out for free.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:54.485]  But here's the thing, I think that we start, it's like anarchists with the pre-printed anarchy t-shirts that you see all the time.
[02:27:54.985 --> 02:28:02.390]  The irony therein, the constitutionalists who want to go pre-constitution to wild west kind of mentality, or even fiefdom
[02:28:02.830 --> 02:28:03.150]  I don't know.
[02:28:20.856 --> 02:28:30.319]  I think the biggest problem right now with sort of the anti-government movement is that it's this states' rights hyper-local and everybody is just kind of going, well, whatever happens upstream is none of my business.
[02:28:31.019 --> 02:28:32.359]  And the problem is it affects you.
[02:28:32.639 --> 02:28:33.600]  It totally affects you.
[02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:38.101]  Well, the Soviets had the ultimate government and they were, in every study, much more toxic.
[02:28:38.501 --> 02:28:40.862]  Just throwing reactors in lakes.
[02:28:41.562 --> 02:28:43.443]  They were good people?
[02:28:43.603 --> 02:28:49.546]  No, they had a communist regime on face that was actually a manufactured monarchy.
[02:28:49.606 --> 02:28:52.548]  Basically, they knocked the monarchy out of the way, and then the Communist Party acted.
[02:28:52.568 --> 02:28:53.628]  Same thing in North Korea.
[02:28:53.668 --> 02:28:54.409]  That's my point.
[02:28:56.590 --> 02:29:00.032]  Yeah, but that's an issue with that country.
[02:29:00.432 --> 02:29:04.734]  We elect our leaders, or at least the perception has always been that we elect our leaders.
[02:29:06.255 --> 02:29:09.096]  You're talking about a time when they had almost no interest in electing him.
[02:29:09.116 --> 02:29:12.497]  They would basically kill whoever was in charge and replace him with somebody who was just like him.
[02:29:12.857 --> 02:29:28.961]  You know, in England, pre-United Kingdom, pre-1707, when you had England as a series of kingdoms, basically the peasants would eventually go, you know what, I'm sick of that guy telling me what to do, and I'm sick of paying taxes to this guy, so we're all going to storm the castle and throttle him.
[02:29:28.981 --> 02:29:29.681]  And that's what they would do.
[02:29:29.721 --> 02:29:34.562]  They'd find whoever the lord was, drag him out of the castle, string him up, chuck him into a river, and then
[02:29:35.968 --> 02:29:38.910]  Not replace the social structure that he had created.
[02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:41.813]  No, they did with Magna Carta and then the Parliament Act.
[02:29:41.833 --> 02:29:42.393]  You're wrong.
[02:29:42.433 --> 02:29:43.354]  I'm not talking about that at point.
[02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:43.614]  Stay there.
[02:29:43.634 --> 02:29:44.295]  We gotta go to break.
[02:29:44.315 --> 02:29:46.796]  We're coming back with both Richard Hunter and Hal Sparks.
[02:29:47.317 --> 02:29:48.638]  Very, very dangerous people.
[02:29:49.639 --> 02:29:50.539]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:52.661]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.582 --> 02:29:56.244]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.557 --> 02:30:02.758]  Hi, this is Steve Schenck and Babs Rosberg with eFoods Direct.
[02:30:03.018 --> 02:30:10.479]  Babs, you work a lot with shipping and things are going absolutely nuts with this new Independence Month Patriot Pack that eFoods is giving away.
[02:30:10.779 --> 02:30:14.820]  The way things are going, we're shipping thousands of these great little Patriot Packs out.
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:19.041]  Just an example, Sherry from Arkansas made a $1,300 order.
[02:30:19.161 --> 02:30:21.642]  We shipped her five free Patriot Packs, $750 more free food.
[02:30:23.982 --> 02:30:27.003]  Folks are really surprised at what we're actually giving away.
[02:30:27.023 --> 02:30:34.107]  Now folks, we've had 235 years of freedom in this country, so for every $235 worth of food ordered, we give away a $149 Patriot Pack free.
[02:30:34.127 --> 02:30:38.309]  To order the best food on the planet, call 800-409-5633 or go to efoodsdirect.com slash alex.
[02:30:47.432 --> 02:30:50.614]  A free 12-day supply Patriot Pack with every $235 worth of food ordered.

[02:31:00.464 --> 02:31:04.106]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:31:04.487 --> 02:31:07.509]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:31:07.729 --> 02:31:12.512]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:31:12.532 --> 02:31:18.756]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:31:18.916 --> 02:31:21.158]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:31:21.698 --> 02:31:21.978]  Tim Geithner?
[02:31:21.998 --> 02:31:22.419]  Bernanke?
[02:31:22.519 --> 02:31:23.120]  They're arsonists!
[02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:23.961]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:31:24.281 --> 02:31:26.723]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:31:40.598 --> 02:31:42.419]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:31:42.439 --> 02:31:47.503]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:31:47.883 --> 02:31:56.990]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:32:00.100 --> 02:32:01.601]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.821 --> 02:32:06.843]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[02:32:07.123 --> 02:32:08.483]  Saving means to make money.
[02:32:08.663 --> 02:32:17.447]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:32:18.187 --> 02:32:25.289]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:32:25.709 --> 02:32:33.331]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:32:33.711 --> 02:32:38.633]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[02:32:38.953 --> 02:32:41.113]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:32:43.834 --> 02:32:44.434]  Big Brother.
[02:32:44.454 --> 02:32:45.215]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:04.204 --> 02:33:05.305]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:05.985 --> 02:33:07.406]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:08.067 --> 02:33:09.247]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:10.208 --> 02:33:14.891]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.206 --> 02:33:33.567]  Okay, we are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and Hal Sparks and Richard Hunter are our guests.
[02:33:33.587 --> 02:33:41.449]  If you go up to the Drugs Report today, one of the top-linked stories, DHS video, characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[02:33:41.669 --> 02:33:47.890]  And, you know, I have the MIAC and Homeland Security reports that police sent me that were big national news two years ago.
[02:33:48.450 --> 02:33:53.891]  I've been to the urban warfare drills, and there are white people, there are black people, there are Hispanics that are role players.
[02:33:54.707 --> 02:33:58.608]  But they're saying, I'm an American, I have constitutional rights, you're not taking my farm.
[02:33:59.269 --> 02:34:01.769]  And I have this on video, the troops practice mowing them down.
[02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:15.194]  And I've gotten, in the last three years, a lot of these other documents where it says the number one threat is white males, it's returning veterans, it's Ron Paul supporters, it's libertarians, it's people that want to end the Federal Reserve.
[02:34:16.134 --> 02:34:17.955]  And they're now putting these videos out.
[02:34:18.874 --> 02:34:26.796]  Which I agree with what you said earlier, that it's meant to, you know, sell black folks and other people to, you know, to not notice that they're the ones really being targeted in Arabs.
[02:34:27.116 --> 02:34:29.577]  So as you said, pattern interrupt, that's one layer.
[02:34:30.017 --> 02:34:32.678]  But the other layer is they're training police everywhere.
[02:34:33.038 --> 02:34:41.000]  And they're training even the Boy Scout Explorer Clubs and the military to take on, quote, gun-owning white rednecks.
[02:34:41.040 --> 02:34:44.621]  They say that's the group that's going to attack the government because look, McVeigh did it.
[02:34:44.701 --> 02:34:44.761]  Yes.
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:03.701]  What is your take on that?
[02:35:03.821 --> 02:35:19.512]  Ultimately, the video that DHS is putting up, the reason I think they're now using white people is because the automatic assumption that anybody who's a threat is brown has led to security breaches or the potential for security breaches because they're automatically, their own pattern is, why would I look at a white guy?
[02:35:19.532 --> 02:35:20.532]  That's not who my enemy is.
[02:35:20.792 --> 02:35:26.096]  But then you have, let's say you have a Muslim extremist organization, an Al Qaeda-ish group, for real.
[02:35:26.717 --> 02:35:28.558]  A real Easter Bunny.
[02:35:28.878 --> 02:35:29.438]  Right, exactly.
[02:35:29.458 --> 02:35:30.119]  A real Santa Claus.
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:32.440]  Right, sorry.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:33.520]  A real Keebler Elf?
[02:35:33.580 --> 02:35:34.201]  No, it's not a real.
[02:35:34.221 --> 02:35:34.841]  A real garden gnome?
[02:35:34.861 --> 02:35:35.601]  No, it's not a real.
[02:35:35.621 --> 02:35:36.401]  A real Tooth Fairy?
[02:35:36.601 --> 02:35:36.801]  Right.
[02:35:37.081 --> 02:35:37.642]  A Tooth Fairy?
[02:35:37.862 --> 02:35:41.262]  Yeah, he's one of the scariest creatures in childhood.
[02:35:41.282 --> 02:35:42.403]  You haven't seen a Tooth Fairy?
[02:35:42.523 --> 02:35:43.363]  No, it's horrible.
[02:35:43.403 --> 02:35:45.764]  Yeah, and they're crunchy and yet no nutritional value.
[02:35:46.384 --> 02:35:48.624]  Entirely made of enamel and the tree is frightening.
[02:35:48.644 --> 02:35:49.245]  Captain Crunch?
[02:35:49.285 --> 02:35:49.905]  Yeah, right.
[02:35:49.925 --> 02:35:52.465]  Some other mythical creatures.
[02:35:52.625 --> 02:35:52.945]  Unicorns?
[02:35:53.026 --> 02:35:53.346]  Leprechauns?
[02:35:55.086 --> 02:36:07.510]  Right, okay, so what I'm saying is, you're at one point saying there is no Al-Qaeda threat, there's no, this is a manufactured thing, there are no Muslims extremists coming with strap bombs to go on a USA Airways flight from Vegas to Idaho.
[02:36:08.210 --> 02:36:13.511]  There may be some, but in other cases it's confirmed the feds are getting mentally ill patsies on planes.
[02:36:14.112 --> 02:36:15.892]  And they got Muttalib on the plane, that's admitted.
[02:36:16.212 --> 02:36:16.912]  Drooling!
[02:36:16.932 --> 02:36:18.613]  Drooling, with no passport!
[02:36:19.335 --> 02:36:19.535]  U.S.
[02:36:19.555 --> 02:36:20.215]  government got him on!
[02:36:20.415 --> 02:36:20.575]  Right.
[02:36:20.635 --> 02:36:21.535]  Here's the thing.
[02:36:22.156 --> 02:36:31.177]  If you have TSA and their habit is every time you test them, no matter how many times you tell them, these nine people are actual threats.
[02:36:31.258 --> 02:36:32.298]  I don't mean manufactured.
[02:36:32.358 --> 02:36:35.278]  I mean genuine psychopaths who roam around.
[02:36:35.298 --> 02:36:39.879]  You've got somewhere in the order of about 100 million airline passengers a year flying in the air.
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:43.580]  One in 78 people are legitimately psychotic.
[02:36:43.840 --> 02:36:47.621]  That's like saying somebody might rob your house so we've got to put armed guards in it.
[02:36:48.041 --> 02:36:48.942]  The world isn't safe!
[02:36:49.002 --> 02:36:53.627]  No it isn't because your house isn't going to fall out of the sky and land on other people or kill other people who aren't there.
[02:36:53.667 --> 02:36:57.391]  The idea that the government must guarantee our safety is the absolute road to bondage.
[02:36:58.294 --> 02:36:59.535]  Okay, but the idea that...
[02:37:28.576 --> 02:37:31.008]  Oh, the government are terrorists!
[02:37:31.210 --> 02:37:32.175]  Break your conditioning!
[02:37:33.244 --> 02:37:34.685]  And you're the one with the conditioning.
[02:37:34.725 --> 02:37:36.226]  You're the one repeating the same arguments.
[02:37:36.246 --> 02:37:36.926]  Look, here's the thing.
[02:37:37.026 --> 02:37:38.767]  They're the one staging the terror!
[02:37:38.927 --> 02:37:39.207]  Gotcha.
[02:37:39.247 --> 02:37:41.308]  Okay, so... They're the one staging the terror!
[02:37:41.488 --> 02:37:43.509]  As a human being... They're the one staging the terror!
[02:37:43.750 --> 02:37:48.072]  I, as the person who actually wants a valuable society around me, okay?
[02:37:48.132 --> 02:37:50.893]  I don't give a shit about... Ah, forget it!
[02:37:50.913 --> 02:37:51.814]  We can't do it one more time.
[02:37:51.834 --> 02:37:52.394]  I understand.
[02:37:52.414 --> 02:37:53.295]  Third time and I'm out.
[02:37:53.375 --> 02:37:53.575]  I get it.
[02:37:53.595 --> 02:37:53.855]  I can't.
[02:37:53.895 --> 02:37:54.215]  I can't.
[02:37:54.455 --> 02:37:54.775]  I get it.
[02:37:54.975 --> 02:37:55.215]  Alright.
[02:37:55.356 --> 02:37:57.677]  You can't debate me with actual intellectual words.
[02:37:58.457 --> 02:38:00.358]  I can't debate you when you're not allowing me to talk.
[02:38:00.378 --> 02:38:00.738]  I agree.
[02:38:00.778 --> 02:38:01.159]  That's true.
[02:38:01.199 --> 02:38:01.459]  Go ahead.
[02:38:02.523 --> 02:38:03.323]  Don't be good.
[02:38:03.483 --> 02:38:04.684]  I'm winning, I'm winning.
[02:38:04.724 --> 02:38:06.425]  He's getting mad, he's getting mad.
[02:38:06.525 --> 02:38:07.705]  You can get loud too, go ahead.
[02:38:08.125 --> 02:38:08.786]  No, it's your show.
[02:38:08.806 --> 02:38:10.466]  You have this silver mic.
[02:38:10.506 --> 02:38:10.847]  Look at this.
[02:38:10.867 --> 02:38:12.167]  They could turn this thing off at any moment.
[02:38:12.187 --> 02:38:13.248]  That's actually a better mic.
[02:38:13.308 --> 02:38:14.568]  The problem is I don't want it in front of me.
[02:38:14.808 --> 02:38:15.769]  It wasn't because I swore.
[02:38:15.949 --> 02:38:16.909]  This is a conspiracy.
[02:38:17.249 --> 02:38:20.911]  Those people at home who heard those missing spots, it was because I said something Alex didn't agree with.
[02:38:20.931 --> 02:38:22.011]  This is not just XM.
[02:38:22.091 --> 02:38:22.651]  No, I know.
[02:38:22.671 --> 02:38:23.112]  Go ahead.
[02:38:23.132 --> 02:38:23.612]  I can't do it.
[02:38:23.672 --> 02:38:24.892]  Okay, here's the thing.
[02:38:25.233 --> 02:38:27.634]  I was mainly joking around.
[02:38:27.674 --> 02:38:28.854]  You look genuinely angry.
[02:38:28.914 --> 02:38:30.515]  Do you believe in any
[02:38:31.135 --> 02:38:35.017]  In any governmental protections, police, fire, that kind of stuff, do you?
[02:38:35.597 --> 02:38:37.218]  Or is it all volunteer?
[02:38:37.238 --> 02:38:38.378]  Is it all volunteer?
[02:38:38.598 --> 02:38:40.419]  We're doing that lawyer tactic.
[02:38:40.439 --> 02:38:41.260]  You're deputized.
[02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:43.421]  You're not letting me answer and you're continuing with your debate.
[02:38:43.761 --> 02:38:45.982]  I believe in constitutionally limited government.
[02:38:49.113 --> 02:38:52.717]  And obviously we've got too much government right now.
[02:38:52.737 --> 02:38:55.960]  The government's adding jobs, the private sector's laying them off.
[02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:58.543]  We're losing the private sector.
[02:38:58.583 --> 02:39:00.344]  We're losing the private sector.
[02:39:00.645 --> 02:39:01.185]  No we're not.
[02:39:01.225 --> 02:39:02.707]  We're not losing the private sector.
[02:39:03.367 --> 02:39:05.429]  Do you believe in constitutionally limited corporations?
[02:39:06.010 --> 02:39:08.071]  That corporations are licensed by a government?
[02:39:08.091 --> 02:39:08.631]  Yes, yes.
[02:39:09.211 --> 02:39:15.433]  I do believe that corporations, especially when they're multinational and pay no taxes, are not alive and are not people.
[02:39:15.473 --> 02:39:20.434]  I think it's okay if somebody wants to incorporate for their particular local small project, but I am against megacorporations.
[02:39:20.454 --> 02:39:20.934]  Okay, great.
[02:39:21.434 --> 02:39:26.335]  At what point does a small government able to compete with a megacorporation?
[02:39:26.375 --> 02:39:28.316]  Because you're going to have an either or, ultimately.
[02:39:28.416 --> 02:39:33.197]  If you cut the size of government, the megacorporations aren't going to be able to siphon the wealth off.
[02:39:33.217 --> 02:39:34.037]  Are you kidding me?
[02:39:34.057 --> 02:39:36.518]  Megacorporations get their profit from government.
[02:39:36.838 --> 02:39:37.398]  No, they don't.
[02:39:37.418 --> 02:39:40.919]  They roll into local areas and suck all the resources out.
[02:39:40.939 --> 02:39:42.799]  This isn't a problem with a resource-based economy.
[02:39:42.819 --> 02:39:44.439]  That's where megacorporations get their stuff.
[02:39:44.599 --> 02:39:49.040]  It's not from inventing or creating appliances or something that you have to actually compete with other people.
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:49.860]  It's oil.
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:51.081]  It's sugar.
[02:39:51.201 --> 02:39:51.961]  It's cocoa.
[02:39:52.221 --> 02:39:53.101]  It's orange juice.
[02:39:53.161 --> 02:39:58.002]  And these people roll in... Actually, more and more, the corporations make their profit off of government contracts.
[02:39:59.648 --> 02:40:01.089]  Listen, I agree with you on the other issue.
[02:40:01.289 --> 02:40:02.090]  Let's just go back and be serious.
[02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:04.792]  They're drinking your milkshake and you let them because you don't want the government to stand up to stop them.
[02:40:04.812 --> 02:40:05.372]  Let's go back and be serious.
[02:40:05.392 --> 02:40:06.073]  Let's go back here though.
[02:40:06.093 --> 02:40:11.317]  Let's talk about... You're more afraid of the government than you're afraid of somebody like BP sucking the water, not the oil.
[02:40:11.377 --> 02:40:12.978]  I said BP should go to prison!
[02:40:13.198 --> 02:40:16.801]  Right now, T-Boone Pickens is sucking the water from under Texas.
[02:40:17.461 --> 02:40:26.211]  While trying to get cities to pass laws to shut down their water supplies so he makes more to create artificial scarcity.
[02:40:26.231 --> 02:40:28.033]  Because local governments don't have the fight back.
[02:40:28.053 --> 02:40:29.335]  Richard Hunter comments?
[02:40:29.395 --> 02:40:31.978]  Yes, can I interject a thought here?
[02:40:32.638 --> 02:40:35.679]  Uh, a general feeling that I have.
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:36.940]  You're not getting my guns.
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:38.741]  A general feeling... I don't want your guns.
[02:40:38.761 --> 02:40:40.161]  Where do you get the idea that I want your guns?
[02:40:40.181 --> 02:40:41.062]  This is a joke, man!
[02:40:41.262 --> 02:40:41.722]  I know!
[02:40:41.842 --> 02:40:46.684]  A general feeling that... But you're actually scared I want your guns, so the joke is based in your actual fear base.
[02:40:46.884 --> 02:40:48.845]  Well, I mean, the average Democrat does want my guns.
[02:40:48.885 --> 02:40:49.525]  No, I don't!
[02:40:49.685 --> 02:40:51.226]  Obama's for gun bans!
[02:40:51.286 --> 02:40:52.227]  No, he isn't!
[02:40:52.247 --> 02:40:53.047]  Richard Hunter!
[02:40:54.076 --> 02:40:55.978]  You guys tell me what's wrong with this idea.
[02:40:57.499 --> 02:41:00.421]  I have a general feeling that... You want a fist fight, pal?
[02:41:00.741 --> 02:41:05.965]  The only people... I'm not going to allow you to fist fight.
[02:41:06.166 --> 02:41:11.850]  I completely understand inherent distrust of government and corrupt elected officials.
[02:41:12.210 --> 02:41:16.614]  The only people that I may distrust more are for-profit
[02:41:18.018 --> 02:41:23.396]  Privately owned CEOs because there is more money to be made in the private sector.
[02:41:24.038 --> 02:41:24.540]  What about that?
[02:41:24.946 --> 02:41:26.487]  Yeah, I think Endgame is a great product.
[02:41:26.507 --> 02:41:26.967]  Is that fair?
[02:41:27.107 --> 02:41:37.291]  Made by a private CEO of a local corporation, and printed on Chinese plastic, and distributed by a machine that's actually made with Chinese components in a warehouse.
[02:41:37.311 --> 02:41:40.232]  What about your DVD that you plugged out of the gates on Amazon?
[02:41:40.572 --> 02:41:42.353]  Oh yeah, but I don't have any problem with that part of it.
[02:41:42.393 --> 02:41:45.374]  I actually speak Chinese and travel over there, so... Oh, I see.
[02:41:45.834 --> 02:41:47.355]  This is liberal dirty tricks.
[02:41:47.655 --> 02:41:51.036]  Folks, I'm not supposed to be able to sell books and videos to get my message out now.
[02:41:51.096 --> 02:41:54.478]  No, no, Alex, can I ask you, though, about... He took it all personal.
[02:41:55.458 --> 02:41:57.439]  Can I ask you about... Are you wearing women's underwear?
[02:41:58.019 --> 02:41:58.879]  About what you think.
[02:41:58.919 --> 02:41:59.499]  All right, go ahead.
[02:41:59.619 --> 02:42:06.120]  Only one in three guys is allowed to, so yeah, I wouldn't... Can I ask you what you think about what I said?
[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:09.201]  Because I completely understand distrust of government.
[02:42:09.261 --> 02:42:13.122]  I'm just saying that I probably fear... Government is a tool of the corporations.
[02:42:13.182 --> 02:42:14.222]  Right, but absolutely.
[02:42:14.262 --> 02:42:16.362]  So it's a distrust of corporations that's your issue then?
[02:42:16.502 --> 02:42:19.983]  But I fear if we eliminate the movement... Do you think you're in here with Ronald Reagan in this interview?
[02:42:20.343 --> 02:42:27.027]  No, I fear if we eliminate the middle man though, I fear what's behind the curtain even more, which is the for-profit CEO.
[02:42:27.187 --> 02:42:28.648]  Oh no, no, no.
[02:42:29.168 --> 02:42:30.289]  They have government power.
[02:42:30.329 --> 02:42:31.609]  They've gotten the government to vote.
[02:42:31.909 --> 02:42:33.130]  And here's an example.
[02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:39.974]  They take your roads over, existing ones, put tolls on it you pay for, and then get a government bailout, which we learned the center of Spain does everywhere.
[02:42:40.034 --> 02:42:40.594]  It's a scam.
[02:42:40.774 --> 02:42:41.935]  Which is a state's rights act.
[02:42:42.375 --> 02:42:43.977]  That's local states' rights.
[02:42:44.017 --> 02:42:51.506]  That's Texas handing over their, basically a federally created, by the way, federal tax dollars, building the federal highway system.
[02:42:51.806 --> 02:42:56.152]  And then Texas decides, you know what, we're going to hand over our toll roads and our major throughways that were made.
[02:42:56.432 --> 02:42:56.913]  That's right.
[02:42:57.053 --> 02:43:01.799]  And Bush had to sign an executive order to block the federal law to let Perry do it.
[02:43:02.515 --> 02:43:07.458]  Right, but you're arguing for a local government... But I mean states can be evil, feds can be evil.
[02:43:07.478 --> 02:43:10.521]  Right, I agree, but at least... It's supposed to be a balance between the feds and the states.
[02:43:10.601 --> 02:43:11.461]  It's getting out of control.
[02:43:11.521 --> 02:43:22.649]  It's supposed to be our local, state, and federal government against corporations and foreign actors against us on one level, and the protection of an actual social structure where we can get where we need to be.
[02:43:22.729 --> 02:43:24.630]  Streetlights and the like on the way.
[02:43:24.730 --> 02:43:25.291]  And vaccines.
[02:43:25.311 --> 02:43:26.352]  Where do you stand on vaccines?
[02:43:26.672 --> 02:43:27.232]  I don't take them.
[02:43:27.452 --> 02:43:29.374]  I think... That's not very trendy.
[02:43:30.094 --> 02:43:33.816]  Well, you seem to have this grouping of Democrats and Liberals like we're all the same.
[02:43:33.836 --> 02:43:34.336]  Same here with me.
[02:43:34.356 --> 02:43:34.636]  It's a joke.
[02:43:34.656 --> 02:43:41.840]  I don't care about your guns, and I don't take the vaccines, and I don't drink bottled water as best I can, and I think... Let me stop you for just a minute.
[02:43:42.120 --> 02:43:48.023]  Because I want to spend some time with you guys and all at the Cap City Comedy Club tonight and the next two nights here in Austin, Texas.
[02:43:48.823 --> 02:43:49.423]  It's very evil.
[02:43:49.443 --> 02:43:50.704]  They have Chinese-made carpet there.
[02:43:51.104 --> 02:43:52.985]  Now continuing... It's a joke, folks.
[02:43:53.025 --> 02:43:54.206]  I like Cap City Comedy Club.
[02:43:56.237 --> 02:43:59.259]  You know, I'm the only guy out there known who puts my films out free on the internet.
[02:43:59.679 --> 02:44:00.140]  Immediately.
[02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:01.220]  I trail-blazed that.
[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:01.941]  That's not true.
[02:44:02.401 --> 02:44:03.722]  There's a site called X-Tube.
[02:44:04.563 --> 02:44:05.423]  No, no, no.
[02:44:06.124 --> 02:44:08.465]  I've been doing this for 16 years, though.
[02:44:08.585 --> 02:44:08.805]  I know.
[02:44:08.965 --> 02:44:10.286]  And that's why I was successful.
[02:44:10.386 --> 02:44:12.728]  But this wasn't a plan of mine to be successful.
[02:44:12.808 --> 02:44:14.229]  I wanted to be successful in the message.
[02:44:14.769 --> 02:44:16.751]  And this is something... Ask Glenn Beck, man.
[02:44:16.771 --> 02:44:19.973]  There's money to be made in freaking people out, whether you're right or not.
[02:44:20.493 --> 02:44:24.896]  I mean, ultimately... Like Obama saying, you better raise the debt ceiling or no Social Security checks?
[02:44:24.916 --> 02:44:25.276]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:44:25.436 --> 02:44:27.517]  I mean, that's absolutely... Okay, enough.
[02:44:27.918 --> 02:44:28.598]  Enough of all that.
[02:44:28.618 --> 02:44:29.699]  I want to get into real material.
[02:44:30.059 --> 02:44:33.641]  Gentlemen, first, Richard Hunter, your view on 9-11.
[02:44:33.661 --> 02:44:37.904]  I mean, if the government was involved and let it happen, the point is, these people need to be removed.
[02:44:38.284 --> 02:44:39.485]  And both parties are involved.
[02:44:39.905 --> 02:44:42.927]  And the former head of Homeland Security admitted they issued terror alerts for political purposes.
[02:44:42.947 --> 02:44:43.787]  Does that concern you?
[02:44:43.947 --> 02:44:44.127]  Yes.
[02:44:44.388 --> 02:44:48.270]  There are elements of 9-11, Building 7, etc.
[02:44:48.310 --> 02:44:50.011]  I look at it like the Kennedy assassination.
[02:44:50.171 --> 02:44:59.714]  I don't have a definitive theory that I'm comfortable with to tell you who I think was exactly behind the Kennedy assassination, but I will tell you without a doubt that it was no lone gunman.
[02:45:00.795 --> 02:45:03.336]  And that's 40-something years removed from that.
[02:45:03.636 --> 02:45:15.580]  We're even closer in time to 9-11, so I don't think it's even possible to say exactly what was behind it, but I think it's absolutely right to question and look at it from every angle.
[02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:22.105]  I think the value of the 9-11 truth movement would be that it's all about the most truthful information that comes out.
[02:45:22.165 --> 02:45:35.056]  Once you start drawing conclusions of your own based on any dog you might have in the race, ultimately you help the governmental architecture version of things by either being viewed as for or against it, whereas you can just go
[02:45:35.496 --> 02:45:38.378]  Look, there is no way Building 7 burned down.
[02:45:38.818 --> 02:45:41.120]  Nobody looks at it and thinks that for a second.
[02:45:41.160 --> 02:45:43.601]  So let's... I want to know exactly what happened.
[02:45:43.982 --> 02:45:46.463]  And until I know exactly what happened, I'm not going to rest.
[02:45:46.583 --> 02:45:48.825]  And I also don't... I'm not going to draw any conclusions.
[02:45:48.845 --> 02:45:56.190]  Let you bait me into, oh, it was, you know, George Bush having breakfast with the Bin Ladens on the morning of the thing, which, you know, which... Well, that's London Guardian.
[02:45:56.430 --> 02:45:56.650]  Right.
[02:45:56.990 --> 02:46:02.494]  Which... And when all air traffic was shut down, five different flights flying the Bin Ladens out of the country.
[02:46:02.534 --> 02:46:02.894]  Totally.
[02:46:03.034 --> 02:46:04.195]  But... And they got caught lying about it.
[02:46:04.395 --> 02:46:04.856]  Right.
[02:46:05.957 --> 02:46:06.737]  Ignore all that.
[02:46:06.797 --> 02:46:08.959]  I'm actually blowing my voice out of here.
[02:46:09.039 --> 02:46:16.186]  It's a problem though that it's so big that that's how they keep us from compartmentalizing one mystery at a time.
[02:46:16.486 --> 02:46:22.332]  Maybe that's the way to attack it, is to look at nothing but building 7 until we can figure something out.
[02:46:22.352 --> 02:46:24.494]  As long as if something's wrong with that, the whole thing's shot.
[02:46:24.514 --> 02:46:26.376]  Whenever you're trying to prosecute a criminal,
[02:46:26.756 --> 02:46:35.202]  If you try to go after that criminal before you have evidence that's offered in court, you go, we'll find the evidence as we go along, but I know that guy's guilty.
[02:46:35.522 --> 02:46:36.342]  He'll always walk.
[02:46:36.642 --> 02:46:37.463]  And that's the problem.
[02:46:37.523 --> 02:46:42.766]  And I think... No, but building 7 is the bloody axe in the back of the trunk that matches the blood of the dead woman they found.
[02:46:42.786 --> 02:46:43.187]  That's true.
[02:46:43.207 --> 02:46:44.648]  And building 7 is the bloody axe.
[02:46:44.688 --> 02:46:45.048]  That's true.
[02:46:45.088 --> 02:46:46.609]  So it's enough to start the investigation.
[02:46:46.729 --> 02:46:47.910]  I believe it's, absolutely.
[02:46:48.450 --> 02:46:50.411]  But ultimately, it's the start of it.
[02:46:50.732 --> 02:46:54.114]  But the truth movement, if it has any value, is the dogged
[02:46:55.327 --> 02:47:04.830]  Search for the actual video of what hit the Pentagon, the towers themselves, any footage that was done other than what was released, as it were.
[02:47:05.610 --> 02:47:10.692]  You need as much of it as possible so that it overwhelms the psychological effect of people not being able to believe the truth.
[02:47:10.712 --> 02:47:12.052]  Sure, Hal, let me ask you this question.
[02:47:12.072 --> 02:47:16.374]  And this is a serious question, I don't want to get in a fight again, even though it was fun.
[02:47:16.394 --> 02:47:17.354]  My voice can't handle it now.
[02:47:17.374 --> 02:47:17.654]  I know.
[02:47:17.674 --> 02:47:18.815]  That's how I get you.
[02:47:19.935 --> 02:47:28.739]  Well, if you go back, though, I understand counterbalancing three branches of government, government counterbalancing corporations, counterbalancing robber barons.
[02:47:29.019 --> 02:47:29.559]  I get all that.
[02:47:29.579 --> 02:47:30.560]  That's actually constitutional.
[02:47:31.100 --> 02:47:39.824]  What I'm saying is, who deals with the federal government when it goes bad and corporations put all their operatives in every position via revolving door?
[02:47:40.124 --> 02:47:46.167]  When the government at the highest levels is covering up 9-11, which we know they're doing, then who deals with the federal government?
[02:47:46.874 --> 02:47:50.397]  Well, ultimately, in a democracy, theoretically, the voters would.
[02:47:50.417 --> 02:47:52.278]  The problem is... Electronic voting machines.
[02:47:52.358 --> 02:47:53.579]  Right, yeah.
[02:47:53.659 --> 02:47:54.620]  And it's confirmed in Ohio.
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:55.461]  No question.
[02:47:55.821 --> 02:47:56.301]  No question.
[02:47:56.562 --> 02:48:00.425]  Electronic voting machines, no paper trail, is a direct affront to a democracy.
[02:48:01.045 --> 02:48:02.246]  There's no question about that.
[02:48:02.286 --> 02:48:04.208]  We're completely on the same page in that area.
[02:48:04.488 --> 02:48:09.932]  But ultimately, regardless of those elements, the voters actually have the opportunity to do that.
[02:48:10.012 --> 02:48:12.074]  That's our only service point.
[02:48:12.394 --> 02:48:14.075]  That's our only way into it.
[02:48:14.115 --> 02:48:15.917]  The problem is, from a corporate point of view,
[02:48:16.457 --> 02:48:22.943]  Trying to control 500 Congress people, Congress critters, you know, is very expensive and a pain in the butt.
[02:48:23.183 --> 02:48:24.684]  And it requires a lot of local maneuver.
[02:48:25.285 --> 02:48:26.506]  Controlling 100 Senators?
[02:48:27.086 --> 02:48:32.711]  Even more expensive because they hold giant districts and I'm competing with other corporate interests and that same.
[02:48:33.492 --> 02:48:39.237]  But the Supreme Court is a way better use of my money as a corporate controller.
[02:48:39.297 --> 02:48:41.539]  If I get people in there who are corporatists,
[02:48:42.239 --> 02:48:44.802]  Running the Scalia's and the Roberts of the world.
[02:48:44.862 --> 02:48:46.924]  The Clarence Thomas who will follow anything behind their back.
[02:48:46.944 --> 02:48:49.828]  And that's why the president's so gay because with a presidency you get the court.
[02:48:50.816 --> 02:48:52.878]  Yeah, ultimately that's what you're shooting for.
[02:48:52.898 --> 02:48:59.484]  I mean, you've got to look at Mitt Romney, for example, who's arguably the frontrunner for the Republican side going this way.
[02:48:59.504 --> 02:49:00.866]  You should love him, he wrote Obamacare.
[02:49:01.807 --> 02:49:03.769]  No, believe me, I'm for a general version.
[02:49:03.789 --> 02:49:05.210]  He's a colossal flip-flopper.
[02:49:06.011 --> 02:49:07.672]  He's an amazing body of flip-flopper.
[02:49:07.692 --> 02:49:08.653]  What about Rick Perry?
[02:49:09.794 --> 02:49:14.759]  Al Gore's former chief of staff in Texas, forced inoculations, NAFTA superhighway power grabs.
[02:49:15.680 --> 02:49:23.510]  I mean, this guy is about as conservative as... Well, he's the guy who... He's the guy who... He's like the guy in the club who's going, this place stinks!
[02:49:23.650 --> 02:49:24.511]  I hate this dump!
[02:49:24.551 --> 02:49:25.212]  This is ridiculous!
[02:49:25.252 --> 02:49:25.752]  I'm leaving!
[02:49:25.793 --> 02:49:26.894]  I want to see your manager!
[02:49:27.114 --> 02:49:27.935]  This is pathetic!
[02:49:27.975 --> 02:49:29.157]  This is terrible service, sir!
[02:49:29.177 --> 02:49:29.938]  Are you the manager?
[02:49:29.958 --> 02:49:30.458]  Are you guys hiring?
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:33.521]  Because that's really what he's doing.
[02:49:33.561 --> 02:49:36.143]  He's arguing for secession and then now he wants to run for president.
[02:49:36.443 --> 02:49:41.366]  I hate this United States part so much that I want to run for the whole of it.
[02:49:41.426 --> 02:49:41.987]  It's absurd.
[02:49:42.327 --> 02:49:45.649]  But the point is, Mitt Romney's going to be the guy, arguably, because they're pushing him to the front.
[02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:47.771]  Evangelicals won't vote for him because he's Mormon.
[02:49:47.991 --> 02:49:50.352]  They'll pair him with an Evangelical to try and balance that vote out.
[02:49:50.392 --> 02:49:50.893]  It'll never happen.
[02:49:50.913 --> 02:49:51.934]  No, they're bringing Perry in.
[02:49:52.254 --> 02:49:53.575]  Yeah, but he won't.
[02:49:54.235 --> 02:49:55.036]  He won't fare any better.
[02:49:56.057 --> 02:50:00.761]  You think because it's, you know, we've got to get another Texan in because it's already been three years since we had one.
[02:50:00.821 --> 02:50:01.702]  Right, he did so well.
[02:50:01.802 --> 02:50:06.067]  But the angle here is, Obama, people thought he would fix everything so quickly.
[02:50:06.087 --> 02:50:07.748]  I didn't think he'd fix things so quickly.
[02:50:07.808 --> 02:50:12.232]  I think people are going to run back over to, let me tell you, the big wig Republicans.
[02:50:12.252 --> 02:50:12.593]  They did it.
[02:50:12.613 --> 02:50:14.355]  And I said this two years ago, Rick Perry.
[02:50:14.595 --> 02:50:15.436]  They did it in 2010.
[02:50:15.756 --> 02:50:17.518]  He has knelt before Bilderberg.
[02:50:18.218 --> 02:50:18.799]  That I don't doubt.
[02:50:18.879 --> 02:50:27.064]  But the 2010 vote was them running back to the other side, and you've got Boehner and Cantor in charge of things, and these guys are corporatists of the highest order.
[02:50:27.244 --> 02:50:42.454]  Mitt Romney is the guy who old-school corporatists rolls in, buys up a company, a local company, run by a local CEO, buys it up... Hey, since we got you guys in here, and the first 30 minutes was nothing but screaming and yelling, you guys want to do 20 minutes of overdrive so we can take phone calls?
[02:50:42.674 --> 02:50:43.015]  I love it.
[02:50:43.055 --> 02:50:47.438]  And we're going to get some headphones on you, and we're going to send subliminal messages in to program your brain.
[02:50:48.318 --> 02:50:48.919]  Is that how it works?
[02:50:48.939 --> 02:50:49.539]  Probably.
[02:50:49.579 --> 02:50:50.900]  Just joking, since you're starting.
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:54.843]  Since you're starting, we're actually... That's right.
[02:50:54.863 --> 02:50:56.244]  Drink Coca-Cola.
[02:50:56.585 --> 02:50:57.265]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:57.285 --> 02:50:57.746]  Stay with us.

[02:55:24.610 --> 02:55:25.250]  Yeah.
[02:55:25.550 --> 02:55:26.631]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:55:26.651 --> 02:55:31.013]  I brought that up and I said, look, you can have debates about whether government's good or not or how big it should be.
[02:55:31.693 --> 02:55:38.296]  I've done a study of these people and the dominant Western powers, they made a deal with China on this and they have a lot of excuses of why it's good.
[02:55:39.136 --> 02:55:42.740]  There is a giant, covert, world population reduction program going on.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:46.785]  Do you guys think, A, that that's going on, or I'm lying, or B, is it a good idea?
[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:51.041]  Yeah, where do you start?
[02:55:52.021 --> 02:55:53.982]  Is it going on?
[02:55:54.743 --> 02:55:55.223]  I don't know.
[02:55:56.403 --> 02:56:01.045]  One thing that I think is so important about these conversations is that nothing is off the table.
[02:56:01.105 --> 02:56:05.007]  I don't hear anything just on premise and go, oh you're crazy.
[02:56:05.407 --> 02:56:15.752]  Don't tell me that our government... One need only look as far as the Tuskegee experiments to know that the US federal government is capable of doing something
[02:56:16.132 --> 02:56:17.773]  Well, specifically people within the U.S.
[02:56:17.793 --> 02:56:18.193]  government.
[02:56:18.213 --> 02:56:19.793]  That's an understatement, absolutely.
[02:56:19.813 --> 02:56:23.154]  So I think it's key to question.
[02:56:24.135 --> 02:56:28.316]  I guess my issue with it all is with sort of an all or nothing approach.
[02:56:28.376 --> 02:56:33.698]  You know, drown federal government in a bathtub or blow it up so big that it's in control of everything.
[02:56:34.098 --> 02:56:36.039]  Both of those perspectives are equally dangerous.
[02:56:36.059 --> 02:56:37.619]  The answer is inform, involve people.
[02:56:37.639 --> 02:56:45.182]  And as Thomas Jefferson said, educate the general public about facts and science and information and tyranny will vanish like phantoms at dawn.
[02:56:45.382 --> 02:56:47.663]  Yeah, and that's why they undercut the Department of Education.
[02:56:47.703 --> 02:56:49.704]  That's why you don't want the Department of Education.
[02:56:49.724 --> 02:56:50.044]  The U.S.
[02:56:50.124 --> 02:56:52.525]  education was a lot better before we had that.
[02:56:52.645 --> 02:56:55.626]  I've had the former head of policy, Charlotte Isserby, on.
[02:56:55.866 --> 02:57:00.448]  She was there in the 80s and they had a program in the Department of Education to dumb people down.
[02:57:00.768 --> 02:57:02.369]  But there's got to be heaven.
[02:57:02.409 --> 02:57:05.370]  That's the 80s mentality of the Ronald Reagans of the world.
[02:57:05.410 --> 02:57:11.093]  They hate big government organizations, so you run the government organization you don't like into the ground.
[02:57:11.293 --> 02:57:12.293]  No, no, no.
[02:57:12.313 --> 02:57:13.774]  It was science.
[02:57:13.814 --> 02:57:14.714]  She released the documents.
[02:57:15.074 --> 02:57:16.775]  This was going on decades before her, too.
[02:57:16.935 --> 02:57:21.157]  Yeah, but saying that's the existence of the Department of Education is the negative.
[02:57:21.177 --> 02:57:22.498]  Instead of using it properly,
[02:57:23.239 --> 02:57:27.829]  So you think a centralized educating system is a good idea and not a diverse one?
[02:57:27.849 --> 02:57:31.116]  I think a standard of intelligence in the country... Thomas Jefferson was trained at home!
[02:57:32.805 --> 02:57:34.145]  Abraham Lincoln was trained at home.
[02:57:34.525 --> 02:57:36.446]  Socrates and Alexander the Great were trained at home.
[02:57:36.466 --> 02:57:39.546]  And what he came up with eventually was the common good.
[02:57:39.566 --> 02:57:42.627]  That we should actually provide for the education and welfare of the country.
[02:57:43.407 --> 02:57:44.287]  That's what he came to.
[02:57:44.947 --> 02:57:45.527]  I was lucky.
[02:57:45.767 --> 02:57:47.268]  I had people at home that would teach me.
[02:57:47.488 --> 02:57:48.308]  But you might not.
[02:57:48.368 --> 02:57:51.808]  And you're getting half the information and all this theocratic nonsense.
[02:57:52.108 --> 02:57:54.549]  And I'm having to deal with you in open business.
[02:57:54.589 --> 02:57:56.289]  Like environmental brainwashing.
[02:57:56.629 --> 02:57:59.029]  Telling five-year-olds about different types of sex.
[02:57:59.069 --> 02:58:00.390]  They shouldn't even be talking about that.
[02:58:00.430 --> 02:58:01.950]  It should be reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[02:58:02.150 --> 02:58:04.151]  But doesn't there have to be a hybrid of that?
[02:58:04.171 --> 02:58:10.173]  But they inject whatever they can for social training and social engineering in school instead of reading, writing and arithmetic.
[02:58:10.253 --> 02:58:11.913]  But doesn't there have to be a hybrid of that?
[02:58:11.953 --> 02:58:16.495]  Because if there's not, that's how things like Jim Crow laws are allowed to exist.
[02:58:16.535 --> 02:58:30.080]  I mean, if you completely deregulate and you leave people up to their own state-to-state devices, which in some instances I'm in favor of, I'm just saying if you totally pull the federal government out of it, then that is how you get black people not being allowed to eat at a diner.
[02:58:30.620 --> 02:58:30.941]  Right.
[02:58:31.341 --> 02:58:35.486]  And if you have a bunch of kids who aren't, their only experience of life... Hold on, we'll talk more about that.
[02:58:35.506 --> 02:58:36.167]  We gotta go to break.
[02:58:36.227 --> 02:58:38.430]  Back in 60 seconds going into overdrive.
[02:58:38.470 --> 02:58:39.331]  Main transmission's over.
[02:58:39.351 --> 02:58:43.576]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:45.218 --> 02:58:47.380]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:49.226 --> 02:58:53.449]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:53.770 --> 02:58:54.370]  Number 1.
[02:58:54.690 --> 02:58:57.833]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:58:58.113 --> 02:58:58.673]  Number 2.
[02:58:58.974 --> 02:59:03.517]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:03.857 --> 02:59:04.298]  It's true.
[02:59:04.598 --> 02:59:09.161]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:09.482 --> 02:59:10.022]  Number 3.
[02:59:10.302 --> 02:59:13.585]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:13.885 --> 02:59:17.588]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:17.788 --> 02:59:18.329]  Number 4.
[02:59:18.589 --> 02:59:20.951]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:21.351 --> 02:59:24.734]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:25.034 --> 02:59:25.235]  Number 5.
[02:59:25.815 --> 02:59:29.738]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:29.959 --> 02:59:34.723]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:35.003 --> 02:59:39.046]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:39.186 --> 02:59:40.767]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:40.967 --> 02:59:43.069]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:59:43.209 --> 02:59:45.811]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:59:45.831 --> 02:59:51.255]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:51.615 --> 02:59:53.056]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:53.657 --> 02:59:56.899]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:07.062 --> 03:00:07.302]  We're good.
[03:00:28.393 --> 03:00:31.556]  We are now into our number four today.
[03:00:31.576 --> 03:00:38.283]  We're going to do 20 minutes of overdrive and we're going to retransmission with our big top story that's gone viral all over the internet.
[03:00:38.303 --> 03:00:39.925]  This will get read by five million people today.
[03:00:40.326 --> 03:00:44.510]  DHS video characterizes white Americans as most likely terrorists.
[03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:46.312]  You got to see it to believe it.
[03:00:47.093 --> 03:00:50.156]  We have a TV host, comedian,
[03:00:51.337 --> 03:00:52.918]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call, man.
[03:00:53.458 --> 03:00:56.399]  Yeah, I'd like to talk briefly about the 10th anniversary of 9-11 coming up.
[03:00:56.419 --> 03:00:56.739]  Sure, go ahead.
[03:00:56.759 --> 03:00:59.320]  A couple buddies and I are just trying to raise some awareness
[03:01:20.945 --> 03:01:25.206]  I would put together a video, a website, put some flyers out there in conjunction with We Are Change.
[03:01:25.966 --> 03:01:29.767]  Just trying to get as many people out to Ground Zero on the 11th as possible.
[03:01:30.067 --> 03:01:33.407]  I truly think this is a big one, 10th anniversary.
[03:01:33.767 --> 03:01:40.029]  Yeah, so the government can't just use the deaths again to sell us, turning America into a giant prison.
[03:01:40.949 --> 03:01:42.129]  Mike, I appreciate your call.
[03:01:42.149 --> 03:01:47.650]  You guys got any comments on how, regardless of what happened with 9-11, how it's been used to transform our society?
[03:01:48.150 --> 03:01:59.275]  Yeah, I think it's always easy to use even genuine crimes, and I don't think this was what it was presented as, but let's say there really is a serial killer on the loose.
[03:01:59.735 --> 03:02:05.058]  It's a great opportunity to act on that fact and make everybody afraid to live and interact.
[03:02:05.078 --> 03:02:13.542]  So you destroy social structures that might be in front of large, and I think it's local, constabularies and corporatists.
[03:02:14.202 --> 03:02:15.043]  I don't know.
[03:02:30.851 --> 03:02:36.072]  Showed up at the Scientology Center in London wearing the V for Vendetta masks.
[03:02:36.332 --> 03:02:38.473]  And an army of them showed up.
[03:02:38.913 --> 03:02:40.273]  It was amazing to watch.
[03:02:40.913 --> 03:02:44.074]  And the news had to cover it just because it was entertaining.
[03:02:44.594 --> 03:02:45.014]  You know what I mean?
[03:02:45.034 --> 03:02:48.975]  There was an element of they learned a valuable lesson about branding and marketing.
[03:02:49.595 --> 03:02:52.256]  The sigil magic that is large corporations.
[03:02:52.276 --> 03:02:53.236]  Well, it was something different.
[03:02:53.256 --> 03:02:54.216]  It's like the
[03:02:54.616 --> 03:02:55.556]  Instead of just a bunch of billboards.
[03:02:55.576 --> 03:02:58.437]  It was like the folks that danced at the Jefferson Memorial and got arrested.
[03:02:58.797 --> 03:03:00.437]  That got giant attention because it was novel.
[03:03:00.817 --> 03:03:05.358]  Or not protesting outside the Texas Capitol, storming into it, got national attention.
[03:03:05.378 --> 03:03:05.698]  Exactly.
[03:03:05.718 --> 03:03:11.940]  And I think there's a value to something similar like that at the 9-11 site that is complete silence.
[03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:16.160]  I mean, they had those zombie fallouts where people would make a point about radioactivity and those things.
[03:03:16.180 --> 03:03:19.121]  People would dress up as zombies and fall around a nuclear reactor.
[03:03:19.141 --> 03:03:23.822]  That gets on the news and it draws more attention than a bunch of people with billboards because that's too easy to ignore.
[03:03:23.902 --> 03:03:24.943]  You've got to think smart, Richard.
[03:03:25.043 --> 03:03:25.743]  Your take on that?
[03:03:25.984 --> 03:03:41.436]  To put it in a phrase, in a soundbite, I think with things like 9-11 and 10th anniversaries and things like that, the message is too often how our world has changed and too little of how our world really hasn't changed.
[03:03:41.776 --> 03:03:43.557]  How the new boss is the old boss.
[03:03:43.597 --> 03:03:52.622]  How this moment in history is very similar to a moment in history from 50 years ago or 100 years ago where opportunists came in and took away freedom.
[03:03:52.662 --> 03:03:54.323]  I mean, that's, you know, the patriarchy.
[03:03:54.343 --> 03:03:55.284]  Yeah, like the red chair.
[03:03:55.324 --> 03:03:57.185]  They used that to take the general public's rights.
[03:03:57.845 --> 03:04:00.688]  Instead of actually going after the, quote, commies over in Russia.
[03:04:00.708 --> 03:04:02.831]  It's like the gays are the new blacks kind of idea.
[03:04:02.951 --> 03:04:03.992]  It's the onslaught.
[03:04:04.012 --> 03:04:08.397]  Gay people are going to marry and they're going to try to inject their gay agenda and all that stuff.
[03:04:08.417 --> 03:04:09.518]  That's the same thing in the 60s.
[03:04:09.578 --> 03:04:12.862]  It was black people were coming to marry your white daughters and that kind of thing.
[03:04:12.882 --> 03:04:17.948]  And it was used as a crowbar to keep people from going, you know, we're not that different actually.
[03:04:18.608 --> 03:04:31.432]  And there's also a lot of conversation about the way the world changed and what these people symbolically meant, and very little conversation about, let's talk again about what exactly happened here.
[03:04:31.732 --> 03:04:33.033]  Let's have that conversation.
[03:04:33.073 --> 03:04:33.773]  And what should.
[03:04:33.933 --> 03:04:38.334]  Ultimately, what kind of security do we genuinely need, and what security do we not need?
[03:04:38.354 --> 03:04:39.635]  And we can all agree as a group,
[03:04:41.235 --> 03:04:43.116]  That there's a certain line we don't have to go past.
[03:04:43.176 --> 03:04:45.738]  That there's a certain amount of risk in life and we can be okay with it.
[03:04:45.958 --> 03:04:46.619]  Stay there, guys.
[03:04:46.639 --> 03:04:48.040]  We got 12 more minutes on this side.
[03:04:48.060 --> 03:04:51.942]  I'm gonna jam in Scott, Janine, Matt, Mike, and John.
[03:04:51.962 --> 03:04:52.723]  That'll be good for calls.
[03:04:52.743 --> 03:04:53.983]  But I want to hear from you on the other side.
[03:04:54.384 --> 03:04:55.244]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:55.284 --> 03:04:58.446]  Our guests are Hal Sparks with Halsparks.com.
[03:04:59.167 --> 03:05:01.969]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[03:05:02.529 --> 03:05:06.412]  Did you know that the United Nations is a Trojan horse to America?
[03:05:07.012 --> 03:05:09.854]  They're bent on the destruction of our national sovereignty.
[03:05:10.435 --> 03:05:14.257]  And Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are in league with them.
[03:05:15.198 --> 03:05:20.822]  Obama and Clinton filed a grievance against the United States concerning human rights violations.
[03:05:21.783 --> 03:05:28.607]  If we accept the United Nations norm for human rights, we'll lose our national sovereignty.
[03:05:29.548 --> 03:05:32.131]  They hate Arizona for upholding our laws.
[03:05:32.832 --> 03:05:35.434]  They want illegal aliens in this country.
[03:05:36.095 --> 03:05:44.003]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[03:05:46.985 --> 03:05:53.229]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:05:53.749 --> 03:05:54.610]  Number one.
[03:06:04.435 --> 03:06:08.417]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:08.717 --> 03:06:13.279]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:13.599 --> 03:06:14.059]  It's true.
[03:06:14.340 --> 03:06:19.762]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:20.042 --> 03:06:23.324]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:23.624 --> 03:06:28.106]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.

[03:08:09.925 --> 03:08:13.828]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.988 --> 03:08:15.128]  Dave's a good guy.
[03:08:15.249 --> 03:08:16.950]  Yeah, he's lovely.
[03:08:30.973 --> 03:08:33.515]  Everybody's a lovely guy after they stop being a jerk.
[03:08:34.015 --> 03:08:36.197]  It's amazing.
[03:08:36.217 --> 03:08:37.558]  That's enough to make you a lovely guy.
[03:08:38.803 --> 03:08:42.865]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Washington.
[03:08:42.905 --> 03:08:44.345]  Scott, you're on the air with our guest.
[03:08:44.365 --> 03:08:44.766]  Go ahead.
[03:08:45.406 --> 03:08:46.386]  Yeah, thank you, Alex.
[03:08:46.506 --> 03:08:57.771]  Actually, I want to redirect the question that you had asked these two, Mr. Sparks and Mr. Hunter, at the very beginning about the fact of Obama continuing the torture, the wars.
[03:08:57.891 --> 03:09:03.994]  King Obama now says he doesn't need congressional approval to bomb Libyans and stuff.
[03:09:04.034 --> 03:09:06.375]  The same things that they decried Bush for.
[03:09:06.935 --> 03:09:12.920]  Where is the criticism now from the quote-unquote so-called left if you claim that you don't like it so much?
[03:09:12.940 --> 03:09:14.801]  Okay, first of all, I'll answer that.
[03:09:16.042 --> 03:09:22.567]  I think there's a big difference between a UN Act defending rebels in another country... Al-Qaeda.
[03:09:23.508 --> 03:09:27.991]  Okay, if you want to say that everybody who is... The leadership is admittedly Al-Qaeda.
[03:09:28.111 --> 03:09:28.932]  I mean, it's not debated.
[03:09:29.508 --> 03:09:35.510]  Right, but the people on the ground, that doesn't automatically preclude that they mean death to America because they're trying to fight Gaddafi.
[03:09:36.470 --> 03:09:46.133]  The point I'm trying to make is there's a huge difference between authorizing our government to be involved in keeping planes from bombing cities in another country,
[03:09:47.533 --> 03:09:51.597]  And invading Iraq and sending massive amounts of troops over there.
[03:09:51.618 --> 03:09:56.582]  Do you think Iraq and Libya or Egypt are the exact same thing?
[03:09:56.863 --> 03:09:57.303]  Tell me that.
[03:09:57.523 --> 03:10:02.488]  Do you really believe that the commitment in Egypt is the exact same as Iraq?
[03:10:02.528 --> 03:10:06.733]  If you're going to denigrate... Well, no, the Iraq thing started with no-fly zones and bombing and all that.
[03:10:06.753 --> 03:10:07.473]  And we've got U.S.
[03:10:07.513 --> 03:10:09.876]  troops there advising them.
[03:10:09.936 --> 03:10:10.857]  In a way, it's worse.
[03:10:11.697 --> 03:10:11.937]  Really?
[03:10:11.957 --> 03:10:12.658]  It's worse?
[03:10:12.678 --> 03:10:13.278]  Let me explain.
[03:10:13.538 --> 03:10:19.802]  It's worse constitutionally because as bad as Bush was, and I was against those wars, he went to Congress and got the approval.
[03:10:20.162 --> 03:10:21.083]  This is a big deal.
[03:10:21.143 --> 03:10:36.732]  This is like Caesar crossing the Rubicon to launch this and then to say it's not a war, it's a kinetic action and to feed us all of this and then to leave troops in Iraq but call them diplomats and to keep Guantanamo Bay going?
[03:10:36.932 --> 03:10:40.074]  Right, well look at the base we have in Okinawa.
[03:10:40.274 --> 03:10:42.996]  Is it possible to criticize Lord Obama?
[03:10:43.036 --> 03:10:47.078]  Of course it is, but you also can't just sweep everything as if it's all equal.
[03:10:47.098 --> 03:10:48.219]  Did he keep the torture going?
[03:10:48.379 --> 03:10:48.619]  Yeah.
[03:10:48.960 --> 03:10:50.020]  Did he keep the secret arrests going?
[03:10:50.260 --> 03:10:52.322]  My whole point is they're bought and paid for by the same people!
[03:10:52.722 --> 03:10:57.946]  Yes, okay, and so here's where Obama supporters, I think, deserve some blame, okay?
[03:10:58.406 --> 03:11:11.676]  It's an analogy I'll draw to the invasion of Iraq in the wake of 9-11 that got us conveniently off of dealing with what really happened there, and now we're focused on invading Iraq that didn't have anything to do with 9-11.
[03:11:11.696 --> 03:11:12.656]  To me, it's the same thing.
[03:11:13.016 --> 03:11:20.662]  You get Obama elected, and if you supported him, you have your guy in office now, but when you vacate the political process,
[03:11:20.782 --> 03:11:20.842]  Yes.
[03:11:50.802 --> 03:11:55.246]  Yeah, but if people go to a Las Vegas fight and boo Don King, it doesn't matter because he owns the fight and he owns both fighters.
[03:12:19.906 --> 03:12:22.988]  But the problem with that is... That's all I'm saying is both the fighters are armed.
[03:12:23.168 --> 03:12:27.270]  So I get the concept of, okay, we need to start over from scratch, but that's a very difficult thing to do.
[03:12:27.290 --> 03:12:28.811]  We gotta admit just how bad this is.
[03:12:28.831 --> 03:12:32.453]  Yeah, but it's a very difficult thing to do midstream to start over from scratch.
[03:12:32.513 --> 03:12:33.914]  Okay, for example, here's a good example.
[03:12:34.534 --> 03:12:37.436]  When Obama got in, he signed an executive order to close Guantanamo Bay.
[03:12:37.836 --> 03:12:42.037]  And he signed an executive order as president, a single act that he can do as an individual.
[03:12:42.057 --> 03:12:42.998]  To close it in one year.
[03:12:43.538 --> 03:12:45.059]  Right, to close it in one year, absolutely.
[03:12:45.359 --> 03:12:58.583]  And the Republicans, specifically, the Republicans in office, defunded a movement of any prisoners into the United States for trial so that they could be tried under a non-military system.
[03:12:58.843 --> 03:13:02.705]  They defunded any area that they would be brought to.
[03:13:02.765 --> 03:13:03.385]  No, they're bad.
[03:13:04.025 --> 03:13:04.606]  I mean, that's wrong.
[03:13:04.626 --> 03:13:18.920]  What I'm saying is, if you're going to say that all I'm doing is inflating Obama and that I support everything he does, you can't just wipe away the fact that he's actually tried to do and been undermined by people who are... No, you made the point.
[03:13:19.240 --> 03:13:20.201]  It's a good point on that issue.
[03:13:20.221 --> 03:13:21.903]  Scott, do you have anything else to add?
[03:13:22.583 --> 03:13:24.667]  No, I wanted to correct Kyle on something.
[03:13:24.687 --> 03:13:31.417]  Actually, if that executive order, if you actually read it, what it said was is that they were going to actually just look at closing.
[03:13:31.437 --> 03:13:33.040]  Yeah, that's what it said.
[03:13:33.180 --> 03:13:36.245]  Not that they were going to, and if it was not practical,
[03:13:36.795 --> 03:13:43.678]  ...that they had other torture sites that they would keep open, so I would... Yeah, the other block site says we'll keep other torture sites open.
[03:13:43.698 --> 03:13:46.039]  No, it said we'll use other sites in other parts of the world.
[03:13:46.119 --> 03:13:51.381]  I can, I remember covering another... Because they weren't guaranteed they could move them into the states and try them in Michigan, which is where they were going to do.
[03:13:51.401 --> 03:13:54.922]  They were going to take them to a federal court in Michigan and try them... No, no, no, no, that point's well taken.
[03:13:55.042 --> 03:13:56.963]  Scott, Scott, I appreciate your call.
[03:13:57.763 --> 03:14:00.706]  The fact is, most Americans wouldn't know what Scott knew or what we know.
[03:14:00.746 --> 03:14:01.266]  That's what's sad.
[03:14:01.286 --> 03:14:03.788]  We've got to get people to even know all that minutia.
[03:14:03.828 --> 03:14:04.669]  People don't even probably remember.
[03:14:04.689 --> 03:14:06.851]  You're going to carry about the rule of law.
[03:14:06.991 --> 03:14:13.897]  And the thing that makes America spectacular in that regard is that rule of law should apply evenly to everyone.
[03:14:13.917 --> 03:14:15.318]  Yeah, but I've got to be honest.
[03:14:15.578 --> 03:14:23.745]  I mean, I gave you that point, but that's what Obama's always done is, well, now we're keeping 50,000 troops two years ago for another couple of years, but they're not
[03:14:23.985 --> 03:14:26.167]  Combat brigades, their combat assistance brigades.
[03:14:26.447 --> 03:14:27.668]  And now we're keeping 15,000 troops.
[03:14:27.708 --> 03:14:29.549]  We've done that in every war... I know!
[03:14:29.569 --> 03:14:30.529]  It's gotta stop!
[03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:31.070]  I agree.
[03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:31.850]  It's gotta stop.
[03:14:32.030 --> 03:14:41.737]  But that's, is that the military-industrial complex just holding on and going, look, one of the biggest, the only things we make in this country anymore are battleships, essentially, and big land movers.
[03:14:42.017 --> 03:14:48.281]  No, no, I've heard, I've heard mainline Republicans going, you know, we're not gonna cut the defense spending, we're not gonna let Obama cut it.
[03:14:48.401 --> 03:14:50.123]  Obama has increased it to record levels.
[03:14:50.443 --> 03:14:51.764]  They should be absolutely happy.
[03:14:52.224 --> 03:14:53.645]  And that's another form of welfare.
[03:14:54.165 --> 03:14:54.946]  I agree.
[03:14:55.087 --> 03:14:57.229]  And very little of that ever gets back to the American people.
[03:14:57.289 --> 03:14:57.990]  I'm against it all.
[03:14:58.331 --> 03:15:03.377]  We don't need six times the armed forces of every other country in the world to fight an enemy that basically doesn't exist.
[03:15:03.397 --> 03:15:07.482]  Well, technically, if you have 100% of military force and equipment and spending, the United States is 54%.
[03:15:07.522 --> 03:15:07.662]  Right.
[03:15:09.511 --> 03:15:11.892]  You're saying six times the biggest other country?
[03:15:12.152 --> 03:15:12.852]  And, no, no, no.
[03:15:13.272 --> 03:15:17.753]  Six times all of them combined as far as warfare capability, including our nuclear arsenal.
[03:15:17.773 --> 03:15:24.234]  I mean, we have, in this country, we have, I think it's somewhere in the order of like 9,800 active nuclear missiles in sites in the United States.
[03:15:24.654 --> 03:15:30.596]  There's something in the order of 7,500 Starbucks in the country, and they're frigging everywhere.
[03:15:31.696 --> 03:15:32.176]  Look around.
[03:15:32.216 --> 03:15:34.698]  Every Starbucks you see, there's a missile and a quarter.
[03:15:34.758 --> 03:15:35.718]  Hey, haven't you heard?
[03:15:35.838 --> 03:15:36.979]  Radiation's good for you.
[03:15:37.019 --> 03:15:38.860]  Let's talk to Janine in New Mexico.
[03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:41.881]  Out there where they've had the radiation fires at Los Alamos.
[03:15:41.921 --> 03:15:42.621]  Janine, you're on the air.
[03:15:42.641 --> 03:15:43.362]  Thanks for holding.
[03:15:44.162 --> 03:15:45.023]  She just dropped off.
[03:15:45.423 --> 03:15:46.283]  She's sick of hearing us.
[03:15:46.643 --> 03:15:47.804]  Matt in Pennsylvania.
[03:15:47.824 --> 03:15:48.404]  You're on the air.
[03:15:48.424 --> 03:15:49.024]  Go ahead, Matt.
[03:15:50.065 --> 03:15:50.865]  Alex, my friend.
[03:15:50.905 --> 03:15:52.266]  How are you doing?
[03:15:52.646 --> 03:15:54.967]  I'm in here with Nikki Sixx and Hal Sparks.
[03:15:56.388 --> 03:15:57.989]  Nikki Sixx and Hal Sparks.
[03:15:58.589 --> 03:15:59.890]  Nikki, I'm in recovery.
[03:16:00.748 --> 03:16:04.312]  First of all, what is white citizens being most likely to be terrorists?
[03:16:20.708 --> 03:16:22.790]  Well, arguably... Everybody knows Whitey's bad.
[03:16:23.130 --> 03:16:30.698]  Well, beyond that, if you look at the statistics of who's actually opening fire in public for random reasons, that's who's doing it.
[03:16:30.738 --> 03:16:31.119]  You know why?
[03:16:31.139 --> 03:16:36.043]  Because we're a nation of mostly white people, and when you look at... Not if you count gang-related.
[03:16:36.644 --> 03:16:38.065]  I can pull up the firearms.
[03:16:38.285 --> 03:16:40.846]  Gang-related shootings are against each other.
[03:16:41.246 --> 03:16:45.608]  Gang members don't walk into a mall and just shoot a bunch of people because they think the cops are coming to take their guns.
[03:16:45.648 --> 03:16:46.788]  It's not random about that.
[03:16:47.609 --> 03:16:48.409]  There's no threat.
[03:16:48.449 --> 03:16:50.590]  As a matter of fact, it's not even particularly news to me.
[03:16:50.610 --> 03:16:55.032]  Oh, now you're going to say that the shooter of the congresswoman was a conservative?
[03:16:56.030 --> 03:16:57.231]  No, he was a psychotic.
[03:16:57.392 --> 03:16:59.574]  Yeah, no, I mean, dressed as a woman, yeah.
[03:16:59.594 --> 03:17:00.775]  He wasn't liberal or conservative.
[03:17:01.116 --> 03:17:04.760]  Even though he'd been a liberal before, he was totally whacked out, taking hallucinogens every day.
[03:17:04.900 --> 03:17:05.341]  He was nuts!
[03:17:05.621 --> 03:17:06.622]  He was a crazy person.
[03:17:06.642 --> 03:17:08.865]  The point is, was he brown?
[03:17:11.007 --> 03:17:18.111]  Is that anti-white to point out the fact that that guy, the guy who's going to... Listen, I'm telling you, I have the training manuals.
[03:17:18.291 --> 03:17:19.652]  I can show them to you.
[03:17:19.772 --> 03:17:36.642]  That's because most of the time, when you look at the crime statistics, because of gang-related stuff in this country, and by the way, the drive-by shootings of the 80s and the early 90s that were related to black and Hispanic people have not arced into some giant, you know, violent wave by black and Hispanic people in this country.
[03:17:37.222 --> 03:17:38.163]  Actually, that has been.
[03:17:38.183 --> 03:17:39.445]  They've been killing each other in record numbers.
[03:17:39.465 --> 03:17:39.785]  No, they haven't.
[03:17:39.805 --> 03:17:42.068]  Violent crimes, actual murders have gone down.
[03:17:42.088 --> 03:17:49.597]  And they're completely equal to when the Irish and the Italians were fighting for alcohol in the early 20s and 30s.
[03:17:49.657 --> 03:17:51.859]  This is the same kind of strategic stuff.
[03:17:51.879 --> 03:17:52.800]  They were shooting each other.
[03:17:52.820 --> 03:17:54.502]  Well, look, look, look.
[03:17:54.562 --> 03:17:55.764]  Hey, hey, I've got a quote.
[03:17:56.064 --> 03:17:59.626]  By a Harvard professor saying we will abolish whites, we will exterminate them.
[03:18:00.807 --> 03:18:03.368]  How do you not have a crazy person almost every education?
[03:18:03.408 --> 03:18:09.252]  The whole point of an open education system is that you allow for bizarre thought at certain times.
[03:18:09.292 --> 03:18:10.152]  That's freedom of speech.
[03:18:10.252 --> 03:18:11.433]  I just want to apologize.
[03:18:11.533 --> 03:18:12.794]  I want to apologize for being white.
[03:18:13.334 --> 03:18:14.114]  You don't have to do that.
[03:18:14.134 --> 03:18:15.595]  You should apologize for being chubby.
[03:18:15.755 --> 03:18:16.136]  That's all.
[03:18:16.176 --> 03:18:16.896]  That's your problem.
[03:18:16.936 --> 03:18:17.716]  Not that you're white.
[03:18:17.797 --> 03:18:20.718]  It's that you eat poorly and you don't take care of yourself and you drink too much coffee.
[03:18:21.038 --> 03:18:24.480]  That's something that's actually going to affect my tax dollars later because... Collectivism!
[03:18:24.680 --> 03:18:25.881]  No, when you get... Collectivism!
[03:18:25.901 --> 03:18:27.302]  No, look, here's the thing.
[03:18:27.482 --> 03:18:29.943]  If you're against government health care, I'm for you.
[03:18:29.983 --> 03:18:30.484]  But here's the thing.
[03:18:30.504 --> 03:18:35.846]  You have to wear a medallion that says if I collapse or my foot starts to go rotten because of diabetes... No, I have my own insurance.
[03:18:35.866 --> 03:18:37.187]  I've never... I have my own insurance.
[03:18:37.207 --> 03:18:39.909]  Right, but... That's what I said when you first got on.
[03:18:40.289 --> 03:18:41.750]  Once you collectivize things,
[03:18:42.370 --> 03:18:47.312]  And once you get everybody communal, then they can start managing and nanny-stating everybody and it's nightmarish.
[03:18:47.632 --> 03:18:48.873]  Let's jam in one more call.
[03:18:49.273 --> 03:18:49.833]  One more call.
[03:18:49.893 --> 03:18:51.674]  We're caring for the people.
[03:18:51.734 --> 03:18:53.254]  By the way, okay, we won't take any more calls.
[03:18:53.274 --> 03:18:54.155]  We've only got one minute left.
[03:18:54.455 --> 03:18:56.816]  The insurance companies wrote that stinking health care plan.
[03:18:56.936 --> 03:18:57.256]  I know.
[03:18:57.436 --> 03:19:02.518]  And then they had all the lying Democratic operatives get up there and say you were racist if you're against health care.
[03:19:02.778 --> 03:19:03.738]  I can play you the clips.
[03:19:04.339 --> 03:19:04.919]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[03:19:05.759 --> 03:19:11.240]  Carlos Watson, Slimeball Matthews, Mr. Maddow, all of those guys.
[03:19:11.300 --> 03:19:11.760]  Mr. Maddow?
[03:19:11.900 --> 03:19:12.200]  Really?
[03:19:12.360 --> 03:19:12.440]  Yeah.
[03:19:12.460 --> 03:19:13.261]  Because she's a lesbian?
[03:19:13.301 --> 03:19:14.301]  You're calling her a dude?
[03:19:14.381 --> 03:19:14.861]  No!
[03:19:14.961 --> 03:19:15.141]  No!
[03:19:15.161 --> 03:19:15.361]  No, no.
[03:19:15.501 --> 03:19:15.881]  Here's the deal.
[03:19:15.941 --> 03:19:17.562]  I don't even care about all that stuff.
[03:19:17.702 --> 03:19:19.062]  I like to make fun of her.
[03:19:19.282 --> 03:19:20.862]  I call Janet Reno Mr. Reno.
[03:19:20.882 --> 03:19:22.303]  Because she has a short haircut?
[03:19:22.383 --> 03:19:23.023]  No!
[03:19:23.283 --> 03:19:24.103]  Because it's funny!
[03:19:24.123 --> 03:19:25.363]  She's a lesbian?
[03:19:25.503 --> 03:19:28.444]  I hear the liberals all the time with all their sex jokes all the time.
[03:19:28.704 --> 03:19:29.824]  No, I think it's funny.
[03:19:30.244 --> 03:19:30.964]  I know that it's funny.
[03:19:31.204 --> 03:19:32.325]  Anyways, getting back to what I'm saying.
[03:19:32.745 --> 03:19:33.645]  Mr. Maddow.
[03:19:34.025 --> 03:19:34.726]  Yeah.
[03:19:34.766 --> 03:19:35.867]  Because I'm not politically correct.
[03:19:35.907 --> 03:19:36.828]  Mr. Maddow.
[03:19:37.048 --> 03:19:38.670]  This is not political correctness.
[03:19:38.730 --> 03:19:39.611]  I think it's a conspiracy.
[03:19:39.651 --> 03:19:40.231]  It's rudeness.
[03:19:40.251 --> 03:19:40.832]  You know what?
[03:19:40.872 --> 03:19:42.614]  I've made jokes about Ann Coulter being a man.
[03:19:43.495 --> 03:19:45.837]  It has nothing to do with whether she is or not.
[03:19:45.857 --> 03:19:49.361]  Yeah, but the point is, well, it's free speech and I think it's funny as hell.
[03:19:49.601 --> 03:19:52.564]  They arrest you now in England for saying that.
[03:19:53.084 --> 03:19:54.065]  An evil white guy.
[03:19:54.426 --> 03:19:54.986]  There you go.
[03:19:55.066 --> 03:19:57.389]  Hey guys, I appreciate you both coming in.
[03:19:57.429 --> 03:19:59.010]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:19:59.451 --> 03:20:01.613]  A man named Dr. Wallach, who is anything but your
