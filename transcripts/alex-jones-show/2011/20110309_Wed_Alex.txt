[00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:09.609]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.071]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:12.753]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:17.018]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.664]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.856 --> 00:00:30.740]  Man, this world is getting crazier and crazier by the minute.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:46.591]  We are going to attempt to cover it all as the private banking cartel known as the New World Order launches offensives against every pillar of a free society.
[00:00:47.622 --> 00:01:04.938]  The currency, the family, private property, our health, everything under assault by these individuals in their constant seeking for complete domination over land, air, and sea, and most importantly, inside our minds.
[00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:26.023]  As the globalists lust after total control of the planet, total control over all thoughts and technology, so that they can enjoy the life extension systems that have been developed for themselves, and so the rest of us can be damned off from it and kept from having access to it, so we can then be orderly exterminated.
[00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:35.689]  This is the stated program and pogrom of the New World Order against free humanity, and we're going to be breaking it down today.
[00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.930]  Now,
[00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:54.683]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, who has been covering probably more than anybody other than Judicial Watch, with FOIA requests and inside sources, the merger of North America into the EU, will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:55.103 --> 00:02:03.489]  And I also want to raise the Ottawa Citizen and other news articles where they're just calmly saying, yes, foreign troops will patrol Canada, the U.S.
[00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.270]  and Mexico.
[00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.271]  It's no big deal.
[00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:16.480]  And they do it where they just throw something so massive and so important right out there in the open and and try to just condition us to accept it.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:34.247]  So we'll also talk about that with Dr. Jerome Corsi coming up in the second hour today and you know sometimes I go six, eight months without having Lindsey Williams on but lately I've been having him on almost every week in the last month because he did call it
[00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:41.205]  And my crew had said they were going to work on it, but I haven't asked them if they have.
[00:02:41.605 --> 00:02:53.368]  Were we able to pull up the October interview with him where he predicted, well he didn't predict, his source told him that in the new year the Middle East would explode and oil would go to 150 to 200 within six months to a year?
[00:02:56.428 --> 00:03:00.012]  And of course, it's not just like Lindsey called it that one time.
[00:03:00.072 --> 00:03:01.714]  He called it repeatedly before that.
[00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.878]  He's going to be coming on the last hour to take your phone calls.
[00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:12.104]  Specifically, Lindsey Williams coming on to take your phone calls in the third hour today.
[00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:31.416]  and uh... again my guys and and and and gal in there that they uh... volunteered and i said i don't have a staffers and listeners we were articles about it but you ought to go pull up from the october interview it's on youtube lindsey williams and pull out for us listeners and posted and and and and and and my crusade now will will get that so uh...
[00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:39.422]  I do want to kind of scare that up by the time that Williams comes on because it's one thing to come on air and say he said all this.
[00:03:39.722 --> 00:03:40.543]  I remember him saying it.
[00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:41.864]  You do as well.
[00:03:41.924 --> 00:03:45.427]  But it's another thing to actually play it so you can hear it on record.
[00:03:46.327 --> 00:03:47.548]  So we're going to work on that.
[00:03:47.568 --> 00:03:54.573]  I just remembered that here on air as I was beginning to speak here at the start of the transmission.
[00:03:55.854 --> 00:04:01.539]  Now there's a lot of issues I want to talk about in the meantime before Dr. Corsi joins us and before
[00:04:02.915 --> 00:04:04.836]  Lindsey Williams joins us.
[00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:11.160]  And one of the big ones out of the gates is the unions and what's happening in Wisconsin.
[00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.943]  And what's now spreading in Michigan, people taking over the Capitol there.
[00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:24.268]  Because so many people email me and call me and write comments and they don't understand what I'm talking about.
[00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:36.411]  I mean, it's kind of like when I describe how gold and silver is a hedge against inflation, people send me emails saying, but then I'll have to cash it in for dollars later.
[00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:45.236]  Yeah, but your gold will keep its value, so when the dollar's devalued, when you cash the gold in, you'll get more dollars back than what it took for you to buy the gold.
[00:04:45.276 --> 00:04:47.177]  And people just say, I don't understand that.
[00:04:47.898 --> 00:04:48.738]  I don't understand it.
[00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.700]  It's like two plus two equals four.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.761]  It's the same thing with these unions.
[00:04:52.941 --> 00:04:54.742]  I'm gonna try to break it down on the other side.
[00:04:54.802 --> 00:04:57.683]  It's as clear as the nose on my face, your face.
[00:04:57.703 --> 00:05:00.405]  I know the general audience understands, but some don't.
[00:05:00.605 --> 00:05:04.847]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:05:05.167 --> 00:05:05.768]  Number one.
[00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:09.209]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.970]  Number two.
[00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.914]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:15.235 --> 00:05:15.695]  It's true.
[00:05:15.975 --> 00:05:21.400]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:21.681 --> 00:05:24.984]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:25.264 --> 00:05:29.748]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:29.988 --> 00:05:32.370]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.094]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:36.414 --> 00:05:41.116]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:46.117]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:50.419]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:52.119]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:52.359 --> 00:05:56.941]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:08.415]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:11.016]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[00:06:11.436 --> 00:06:20.239]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:28.382]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[00:06:28.742 --> 00:06:30.563]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[00:06:30.763 --> 00:06:31.263]  We're good.
[00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:07.993]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:07:08.253 --> 00:07:10.534]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:07:10.814 --> 00:07:16.016]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:07:16.197 --> 00:07:18.978]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.299]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:27.484]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:07:27.804 --> 00:07:31.006]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:07:31.186 --> 00:07:36.710]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:38.272]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:39.813]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:42.455]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:46.638]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:07:46.798 --> 00:07:48.519]  You can find the video at www.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.281]  End of America 3 dot com.
[00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:53.863]  That's End of America, the number 3 dot com.

[00:08:05.492 --> 00:08:09.695]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:11.136]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:12.917]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:17.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.641 --> 00:08:21.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.828 --> 00:08:29.749]  We are live.
[00:08:29.829 --> 00:08:34.051]  It is Wednesday, the ninth day of March 2011.
[00:08:34.171 --> 00:08:39.694]  We're going to be live here, obviously, for the next three hours.
[00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:45.178]  Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us on the fact that the North American Union never went away.
[00:08:45.238 --> 00:08:46.679]  It's being integrated by stealth.
[00:08:47.219 --> 00:08:52.022]  And now Obama has continued the continuity of agenda with Clinton.
[00:08:53.446 --> 00:09:00.229]  Uh, and George W. Bush right through to Obama today, and it's in high gear.
[00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.431]  Then, of course, we have Lindsey Williams joining us.
[00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:08.794]  Don't forget, he did say, and we have found the clip, back from, what was it, October 20th?
[00:09:12.055 --> 00:09:34.689]  October 21st of last year, where he specifically over and over again said his source, former head of a big three oil company, said on record, on record, to Lindsey, and Lindsey put it on record here, that it would go to $150 to $200 a barrel within six months to a year on Middle East crises.
[00:09:38.078 --> 00:09:49.946]  And the name of the video that has it all broken down from the 21st of October last year is Crude Oil is going to $150-$200 a barrel, Lindsey Williams predictions, Alex Jones.
[00:09:51.409 --> 00:10:01.199]  And this was uploaded to Planet Earth Awaken 01 on YouTube, October 21st, 2010, the day it happened.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.984]  So we're going to be playing that later when Lindsey joins us.
[00:10:06.385 --> 00:10:12.931]  Let me just give you a smattering of some of the news and information that's here in front of me.
[00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:21.739]  And then I will get specifically into the unions and what's happening on that front.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.247]  But Saudi Arabia's day of rage lures record bets on $200 a barrel oiled.
[00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:31.692]  And they're betting on that for June delivery.
[00:10:31.752 --> 00:10:38.335]  So that's what the majority of the bets are, is that oil is going to be $200 a barrel in June.
[00:10:38.375 --> 00:10:45.939]  That would make William's prediction of six months for it to be in full swing absolute precision.
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.761]  Continuing, here's the London Telegraph.
[00:10:49.821 --> 00:10:50.642]  That was Bloomberg.
[00:10:51.202 --> 00:10:58.486]  Oil market braces for Saudi rage as global spare capacity wears thin.
[00:11:00.524 --> 00:11:10.907]  Oil hovers at around 105 right now, but futures for just in the next two weeks have it at about 120 or higher on average, between 114 and 122, depending on what type of crude it is and where it's being delivered from.
[00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:18.871]  Uh, so that's just some of what we're going to be covering.
[00:11:19.272 --> 00:11:22.575]  We've got a lot of news, obviously, with what's going on in Libya.
[00:11:22.596 --> 00:11:37.212]  Uh, you know that it's been proven that Qaddafi was not strafing crowds of unarmed people, that he did not flee to Venezuela three weeks ago, and, uh, he is not the missing member of the, uh, Brady Bunch or a sleaze stack from Land of the Lost.
[00:11:38.444 --> 00:11:56.997]  More and more people realize we're being given total fantasy out of the North African country and that the globalists want that biggest oil supply in Africa for themselves so they can shut it down and create artificial scarcity and make even bigger profits and have a post-industrial
[00:11:58.155 --> 00:11:58.495]  I think?
[00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:20.440]  And I've read it as well.
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:21.981]  It doesn't take a rocket scientist.
[00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:25.664]  It clearly states that indefinite detention can be done to U.S.
[00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:26.244]  citizens.
[00:12:27.225 --> 00:12:28.045]  There's no court.
[00:12:28.846 --> 00:12:40.053]  If the Pentagon or any adjunct of the President wishes to grab a citizen, put a bag over your head, you can disappear forever and be tortured to death or put before a secret tribunal.
[00:12:41.534 --> 00:12:44.915]  And basically executed or imprisoned for life.
[00:12:45.555 --> 00:12:50.737]  And so you notice we told you in Obama deception that he was not going to shut down Guantanamo Bay.
[00:12:52.258 --> 00:12:54.799]  Again, everything Obama says is a lie.
[00:12:54.939 --> 00:12:56.359]  Everything is a double-cross.
[00:12:56.499 --> 00:12:58.300]  Everything is a fraud.
[00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:06.763]  Everything is a foil and a deception within a scam, within a lie, within a camouflage deceit, within a shill.
[00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:16.113]  Wheels within wheels, lies within lies, and so you can't listen to what they say, you've got to look at what they do, and then that's crystal.
[00:13:16.573 --> 00:13:19.974]  Total unity, total continuity of agenda.
[00:13:22.374 --> 00:13:33.197]  From the time JFK had his head blown off in 1963, and there was plenty of corruption before that, but the military-industrial complex said, look, we overthrow third world countries,
[00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:35.632]  We kill whoever we want.
[00:13:35.692 --> 00:13:38.134]  We shoot little kids up worldwide with polio.
[00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:39.675]  We're black ops.
[00:13:39.755 --> 00:13:40.295]  We're death.
[00:13:40.395 --> 00:13:40.936]  We're murder.
[00:13:41.396 --> 00:13:42.277]  We run this country.
[00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:43.778]  We're foreign bank mercenaries.
[00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:47.681]  And we killed the president in broad daylight and we run this country now.
[00:13:48.361 --> 00:13:49.783]  Now sit down and shut up.
[00:13:50.883 --> 00:13:56.748]  And then they came in with big government and invested your pension funds in offshore banks and they've taken all of that and the derivatives.
[00:13:57.739 --> 00:13:59.041]  And they're going to take your health care.
[00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:02.405]  And they're going to forcibly shoot you up with cancer-filled vaccines.
[00:14:03.146 --> 00:14:06.090]  And they're going to give you a bunch of red, white, and blue packaging on it.
[00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:13.440]  And most of you are going to fall down on your knees, guzzle fluoride, inject your children, and roll over and enjoy the early death.
[00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:16.224]  I understand that fully.
[00:14:16.784 --> 00:14:26.829]  You're going to gibber and laugh like arrested development monkeys, Howard Stern listeners, everyone, as you go off the cliff straight into Valhalla.
[00:14:27.169 --> 00:14:28.590]  So knock yourselves out.
[00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.492]  As for me and my house, we know what's going on.
[00:14:32.912 --> 00:14:35.153]  We've been right across the board.
[00:14:35.513 --> 00:14:41.016]  We've studied history, and we are firing up the cadres, the powerful remnant
[00:14:41.696 --> 00:14:45.239]  A lot more than 5% that our revolutionary forebearers had.
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:50.063]  We got probably more like 15% to bring in the big W against the New World Order.
[00:14:51.084 --> 00:14:54.567]  But we realize how serious it is and that we don't have a choice.
[00:14:54.607 --> 00:14:59.172]  We got to go all the way for the big win and it's going to be boldness.
[00:14:59.432 --> 00:15:00.513]  It's going to be focus.
[00:15:01.093 --> 00:15:08.220]  It's going to be dedication and commitment and fearlessness and accuracy and understanding.
[00:15:09.289 --> 00:15:11.771]  And true discernment that's going to carry us out of this.
[00:15:12.912 --> 00:15:16.614]  And we've got to rely and throw ourselves in the providence of God.
[00:15:17.795 --> 00:15:22.178]  God wants to help us, but we've got to help ourselves first and show we've got the courage.
[00:15:22.598 --> 00:15:30.183]  You throw yourself in front of the train, you stand up against Goliath, God will guide you, ladies and gentlemen, but not until you take the field.
[00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:36.388]  It is not until you take the field that you will feel yourself connected, literally, to the
[00:15:37.466 --> 00:15:38.666]  Energy of the universe.
[00:15:39.487 --> 00:15:55.751]  Once you take the field, once you step out on the plate, once you make that commitment, that eye of the tiger commitment, that you are going 110%, as soon as you step through that doorway, as soon as you get past your fear, you will truly be alive.
[00:15:56.131 --> 00:16:03.293]  And you will stop being flotsam and jetsam that can just be manipulated ad nauseam at the globalist leisure.
[00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:13.849]  But it takes getting rid of some of your preconceived notions and the mental symbols that you've been pre-programmed with, myself included.
[00:16:14.249 --> 00:16:15.830]  I constantly say, our military.
[00:16:16.971 --> 00:16:17.532]  Our government.
[00:16:17.972 --> 00:16:19.013]  It's not our military.
[00:16:19.153 --> 00:16:20.714]  Oh, our citizens are in it.
[00:16:21.315 --> 00:16:30.382]  Many of them good people being used, being mind controlled with a false political projection hologram pushed into their minds by propaganda.
[00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:33.966]  But it's not our military, it's not our government.
[00:16:34.246 --> 00:16:36.967]  We have to admit America fell a long time ago.
[00:16:37.327 --> 00:16:39.747]  We have to admit we've been hijacked and overtaken.
[00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:42.108]  The government isn't corrupt.
[00:16:42.968 --> 00:16:45.008]  That was a long time ago that it was corrupt.
[00:16:45.648 --> 00:16:47.569]  The government is completely taken over.
[00:16:48.649 --> 00:16:51.570]  And I use the analogy of John Carpenter's 1982 or 83 The Thing.
[00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.310]  They dig it up in the snow, crash-flying saucer,
[00:17:01.044 --> 00:17:16.516]  Uh, you know, the Norwegians do, and the American base goes out and checks out the Norwegian base, and basically everybody's dead, but there's this deformed creature in the snow that's been partially burned.
[00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:22.800]  They bring it back to their base, and it thaws out and starts basically overtaking members of the Arctic Party.
[00:17:23.772 --> 00:17:26.695]  Or the Antarctic Party, and absorbing them.
[00:17:27.436 --> 00:17:30.679]  And once it's absorbed somebody, it can perfectly mimic them.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.963]  But, it doesn't mean it's that person.
[00:17:36.064 --> 00:17:39.427]  Well, this thing doesn't even mimic our Republic.
[00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:41.229]  It is tyranny incarnate.
[00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:43.411]  It follows every rule of tyranny.
[00:17:43.732 --> 00:17:45.834]  It announces itself as brazen tyranny.
[00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.031]  Because the psychological warfare chiefs made the decision to hide it in plain view.
[00:17:51.731 --> 00:17:53.311]  And to not try to shield it anymore.
[00:17:53.771 --> 00:18:01.033]  Because they want to go full bore so they need to break our will and condition us and push the envelope so we accept it.
[00:18:02.873 --> 00:18:03.553]  So we're here.
[00:18:05.574 --> 00:18:06.534]  We're here right now.
[00:18:06.974 --> 00:18:08.874]  We're going into very deep tyranny.
[00:18:08.914 --> 00:18:10.575]  We know exactly where this leads.
[00:18:10.935 --> 00:18:12.415]  We have the historical roadmap.
[00:18:12.435 --> 00:18:15.396]  We have the globalist own statements about where they're taking us.
[00:18:15.576 --> 00:18:16.216]  And it's hellish.
[00:18:18.323 --> 00:18:20.244]  And our government's gone.
[00:18:20.885 --> 00:18:21.906]  It's not corrupt.
[00:18:24.988 --> 00:18:27.490]  I mean, it is corrupt, but that's not enough of a word.
[00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.392]  It's fully unconstitutional.
[00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:31.813]  It's fully illegitimate.
[00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:33.394]  It's fully criminal.
[00:18:34.354 --> 00:18:39.818]  And the few good apples in the rotten barrel, like Ron Paul, are demonized ad infinitum.
[00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:43.721]  By the liberal media, the conservative media, they're ignored.
[00:18:44.181 --> 00:18:47.444]  As they enter the election cycle, the media won't even report that he won the straw poll.
[00:18:49.016 --> 00:18:56.063]  I hear so-called conservative radio news every day talking about Republican leading contenders, never mentioning Ron Paul.
[00:18:57.224 --> 00:19:01.167]  And again, that's just one example of how they enjoy.
[00:19:01.768 --> 00:19:04.230]  Most of these people in the media love selling out.
[00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.671]  They don't even have to be given orders.
[00:19:06.012 --> 00:19:12.378]  They just know to sell out and play the party line, and they feel like winners sitting there nesting
[00:19:13.478 --> 00:19:23.703]  Uh, in their IRN, you know, radio news, and in their Fox News, and the rest of it, getting off on the power of deceiving by omission.
[00:19:24.103 --> 00:19:27.445]  Getting off on keeping people from real solutions.
[00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:28.165]  They like it!
[00:19:29.185 --> 00:19:33.668]  They enjoy it like a moth thinks it's winning when it flies into a flame.
[00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:38.430]  Alright, um...
[00:19:39.457 --> 00:19:48.207]  I'm going to continue with the smattering of some of the other headlines here and then I'm going to get into the 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:19:48.388 --> 00:19:49.889]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.836]  I don't know how to put it more simple, but I'm going to try to really put it out simply.
[00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:00.717]  The good guys and the bad guys in this whole union situation that we predicted.
[00:20:01.177 --> 00:20:08.305]  HempUSA.org has a revolutionary wonder food for detoxing the body and rebuilding the immune system.
[00:20:08.525 --> 00:20:16.854]  Microplant powder can help unclog arteries and soften heart valves while removing heavy metals, virus, fungus, bacteria, and parasites.
[00:20:17.054 --> 00:20:20.596]  Plus, it cleans and purifies the blood, lungs, stomach, and colon.
[00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:23.737]  Keep your body clean with micro plant powder.
[00:20:24.037 --> 00:20:27.259]  Visit us at hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[00:20:30.558 --> 00:20:31.639]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:36.182]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:20:36.362 --> 00:20:42.066]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:20:42.186 --> 00:20:45.588]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:48.430]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:53.453]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[00:20:53.593 --> 00:20:53.814]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.834 --> 00:20:55.235]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.798 --> 00:21:02.379]  America, you've been warned.
[00:21:02.739 --> 00:21:09.623]  For weeks, we've been warning you about a single event we believe will happen in the next 12 months that will shake the very foundations of our nation.
[00:21:09.783 --> 00:21:12.825]  We've told you about the video that details this shocking prediction.
[00:21:13.165 --> 00:21:16.627]  So far, over 6 million people have watched this free video online.
[00:21:16.847 --> 00:21:17.287]  Have you?
[00:21:17.667 --> 00:21:20.929]  Again, this big event has nothing to do with war or the stock market.
[00:21:21.229 --> 00:21:21.569]  We're good.
[00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:40.155]  We're good.
[00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:01.075]  Gold.
[00:22:01.335 --> 00:22:02.696]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:02.956 --> 00:22:09.058]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:09.238 --> 00:22:13.040]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.280]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.621]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:17.781 --> 00:22:25.384]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:22:25.404 --> 00:22:26.184]  We're good to go.
[00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:52.436]  My name is Spann and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[00:23:07.938 --> 00:23:12.399]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[00:23:12.659 --> 00:23:14.560]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.040]  It made me feel breathless.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.481]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[00:23:20.881 --> 00:23:21.881]  Nothing did anything.
[00:23:21.961 --> 00:23:25.922]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[00:23:25.942 --> 00:23:29.383]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:30.063 --> 00:23:32.704]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[00:23:33.144 --> 00:23:37.785]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.
[00:23:38.165 --> 00:23:40.746]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.
[00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:45.587]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a lifetime 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.
[00:23:45.767 --> 00:23:47.468]  Details at HPExtract.com or call 866-295-5305.
[00:23:47.488 --> 00:23:47.648]  Call 866-295-5305.
[00:23:47.668 --> 00:23:48.948]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:17.714 --> 00:24:27.581]  The wages of the New World Order are death and destruction and pain and humiliation and starving men, women and children.
[00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:28.361]  Famine.
[00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:30.823]  Ghettos.
[00:24:32.364 --> 00:24:33.325]  Bioweapons.
[00:24:33.545 --> 00:24:35.266]  Genetically engineered food.
[00:24:35.707 --> 00:24:36.767]  Poisoned planet.
[00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:49.226]  An elite on an incredible power trip who have at their fingertips technology 30 to 50 years advanced of what we even know.
[00:24:49.786 --> 00:24:51.147]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[00:24:52.208 --> 00:25:03.114]  A public under narcissistic mind control being reduced down the level of demonic five-year-olds, unable to critically think, reveling in their own ignorance and servitude.
[00:25:03.534 --> 00:25:05.995]  Grown men acting like gibbering monkeys.
[00:25:06.375 --> 00:25:09.117]  Women acting like nothing but debased whores.
[00:25:11.744 --> 00:25:14.268]  Oh, we're going to be breaking down International Women's Day.
[00:25:14.828 --> 00:25:19.355]  How much the UN cares about women, and women kind of look at the surface of it and go, go girl!
[00:25:19.695 --> 00:25:20.476]  Girls team!
[00:25:20.857 --> 00:25:21.978]  Yeah, girls team.
[00:25:22.379 --> 00:25:24.702]  The truth is there are no women, there are no men.
[00:25:24.962 --> 00:25:28.207]  There is homo sapien sapien, the combined grouping.
[00:25:29.349 --> 00:25:32.171]  And when they attack a woman or a man, they attack us all.
[00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:33.372]  We're under attack.
[00:25:33.612 --> 00:25:36.634]  The New World Order isn't an empire that just attacks countries.
[00:25:37.355 --> 00:25:38.716]  It attacks the individual.
[00:25:38.776 --> 00:25:39.937]  It attacks language.
[00:25:40.297 --> 00:25:41.998]  It attacks speech.
[00:25:42.178 --> 00:25:43.880]  It attacks intelligence.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.282]  Because it is an extermination system.
[00:25:48.423 --> 00:25:57.870]  It is a full-spectrum, dominance, death machine, unleashed, and we're only in the middle phases of its
[00:25:59.227 --> 00:26:02.749]  Unfolding system of total grid control.
[00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:14.197]  When the grid is completed, and we're approaching that point, then the rollout exterminations will begin through controlled bioweapon releases that will be blamed on accidents, but also on terrorists.
[00:26:15.697 --> 00:26:30.869]  The tens of thousands that die in the first waves will be used as martyrs to set up highly controlled bio-containment grids over cities, integrated with the carbon tax control grids, as another overlay pretext for total surveillance.
[00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:37.794]  Then, a few years after those grids have been put in, mass plagues will hit, killing hundreds of millions.
[00:26:38.655 --> 00:26:41.057]  Then even greater controls will be put in place.
[00:26:41.417 --> 00:26:42.698]  Then the super mega-death.
[00:26:44.124 --> 00:26:49.687]  They intend to release a bioweapon and probably only keep 5-10,000 people alive.
[00:26:50.028 --> 00:26:54.771]  They tell their minions and acolytes that 20% will be left alive.
[00:26:54.811 --> 00:27:00.134]  That's in the official UN Biological Diversity Assessment 1996 Club of Rome statements.
[00:27:00.474 --> 00:27:03.036]  You hear the Ted Turner statements, the Jacques Cousteau statements.
[00:27:03.656 --> 00:27:09.300]  Because the government minions and bureaucrats and power-tripping computer company owners, you know, they think they're going to be on the inside.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:09.660]  So they say,
[00:27:10.542 --> 00:27:16.680]  For the outer masses that are into the control freak religion of talking about killing the unwashed masses, they say 80% kill.
[00:27:19.042 --> 00:27:40.197]  But when you get into actual academic circles, they say 95%, and that's it, Peter Singer at Princeton, Dr. Pianka, UT, every university, they run all the major departments, they always publish books, Rockefeller Foundation, or UN, saying we need global police state to carry out the extermination, and then the true acolytes say, I am not worthy,
[00:27:41.898 --> 00:27:43.779]  Hardcore savage death machines!
[00:27:57.603 --> 00:28:00.044]  Ready to kill you and your family, and they can't wait.
[00:28:00.284 --> 00:28:02.925]  And they think you're too weak to understand their attack profile.
[00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:04.966]  I've given it all to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:05.226 --> 00:28:07.366]  Listen to me, police officers, military, all of you.
[00:28:07.506 --> 00:28:09.527]  They're gonna murder all of us, deader than a hammer.
[00:28:09.687 --> 00:28:18.510]  You better come in and join the Republic for the big win, and we need to deal with these people immediately, and build the bases, and go off-world, and there can be a trillion humans.
[00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.472]  We don't have to act like this and let a bunch of degenerate scum run our lives.
[00:28:22.732 --> 00:28:23.332]  I've had it!
[00:28:23.992 --> 00:28:24.492]  Wake up!
[00:28:24.592 --> 00:28:26.293]  I demand you break your conditioning!
[00:28:28.393 --> 00:28:37.521]  Because when you get into their higher-level literature, they say humans are a parasite, period, and they're gonna kill everybody, except for the chosen few that merge with machines.
[00:28:40.583 --> 00:28:44.246]  They hate creation, they hate the natural order, they hate the family.
[00:28:44.607 --> 00:28:45.748]  These are sickos.
[00:28:46.548 --> 00:28:51.673]  Look at the tropism of tyranny, how it's always black uniforms, torture, death, burning cities.
[00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:58.838]  That's what tyranny manifests, these psychopaths that get control in the last 6,000 years of known civilization.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:05.288]  Now you project that forward with a high-tech overlay and all the systems they've got, what does that spell?
[00:29:05.668 --> 00:29:07.411]  Hellraiser-type situation.
[00:29:09.386 --> 00:29:12.908]  Now, you have been warned, but I'm sick and tired of people's weakness.
[00:29:13.408 --> 00:29:17.650]  You're strong enough out there, if you're conscious of the mind control, to break your conditioning.
[00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.311]  Now, you've still got human instincts that took our species this far.
[00:29:21.832 --> 00:29:26.154]  And at a tribal, instinctive, spiritual level, you know you're hearing 100% truth.
[00:29:26.554 --> 00:29:35.398]  You know that I am here, literally the spirit of your ancestors, speaking to the spirit of your ancestors, right now, and demanding that you break your conditioning.
[00:29:35.638 --> 00:29:41.983]  And that you join humanity for all of our ancestors that fought and sacrificed and bled for us to be here today.
[00:29:42.223 --> 00:29:45.105]  And that we now make them proud in the universe.
[00:29:45.906 --> 00:29:50.249]  And that justice bends towards the truth and we're gonna win.
[00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:51.730]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:53.832]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:57.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.605 --> 00:30:06.246]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:30:06.566 --> 00:30:14.688]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:30:15.428 --> 00:30:19.469]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:30:20.049 --> 00:30:30.871]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:40.515]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:31:01.903 --> 00:31:05.526]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:05.926 --> 00:31:08.928]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:09.168 --> 00:31:13.932]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:13.952 --> 00:31:20.176]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:20.356 --> 00:31:22.598]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:31:22.978 --> 00:31:23.238]  Tim Geithner?
[00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:23.418]  Bernanke?
[00:31:23.438 --> 00:31:23.879]  They're arsonists!
[00:31:23.939 --> 00:31:24.579]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:24.659 --> 00:31:26.620]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:42.031 --> 00:31:43.872]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:43.892 --> 00:31:48.953]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:49.313 --> 00:31:58.416]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:00.455 --> 00:32:04.698]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:32:05.018 --> 00:32:05.278]  Number 1.
[00:32:05.918 --> 00:32:09.080]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:32:09.341 --> 00:32:09.901]  Number 2.
[00:32:10.201 --> 00:32:14.764]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:32:15.104 --> 00:32:15.545]  It's true.
[00:32:15.845 --> 00:32:20.408]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:32:20.708 --> 00:32:21.268]  Number 3.
[00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:24.830]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:32:25.131 --> 00:32:28.833]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:29.574]  Number 4.
[00:32:29.834 --> 00:32:32.196]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:32:32.596 --> 00:32:35.980]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:36.480]  Number 5.
[00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:40.984]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:32:41.204 --> 00:32:45.969]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:32:46.249 --> 00:32:50.275]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:33:12.887 --> 00:33:14.468]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[00:33:14.488 --> 00:33:15.268]  to 2 p.m.
[00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:16.949]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.871]  We are here live, back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:33:22.412 --> 00:33:25.334]  You heard some of my frustration come through earlier.
[00:33:27.175 --> 00:33:34.239]  This nightmare doesn't have to happen if we'll just get our survival instincts back and realize that we're under assault.
[00:33:35.219 --> 00:33:41.183]  I mean, if your neighbor came over and slapped you in the face, a neighbor you've known 10 years, you'd punch him in the nose.
[00:33:42.278 --> 00:33:56.887]  But the globalists steal your money, try to take your kids away from you, brainwash them, poison your food, your water, and then run around as a bunch of authority figures with cops standing behind them with, like, ancient, you know, monkey suits on.
[00:33:56.907 --> 00:33:57.968]  That's what chiefs...
[00:33:58.168 --> 00:34:01.650]  We wear big ribbons and crowns to impress people.
[00:34:02.091 --> 00:34:05.373]  Government wear these jackets with all these markings on it.
[00:34:05.413 --> 00:34:07.915]  Just a bunch of primitive monkey behavior.
[00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:12.458]  And then we bow down to these criminals who are just running all over us.
[00:34:12.538 --> 00:34:13.098]  I've had it!
[00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:14.699]  I've had it!
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:15.940]  I'm done!
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:22.885]  And I'm tired of just one-dimensional moronic thinking and people not understanding.
[00:34:23.888 --> 00:34:24.929]  It's very frustrating.
[00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:45.419]  Now, I want to hit some more of the news that's percolating out there, and then I want to break down, simply and succinctly, I'm going to try it again because some didn't understand, why I'm angry at not just the governor of Wisconsin, but also people like Michael Moore.
[00:34:46.564 --> 00:34:49.648]  Because see, folks are like, but the media says we gotta choose a side.
[00:34:49.968 --> 00:34:51.570]  We gotta choose Republican or Democrat.
[00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.052]  We gotta choose Liberal or Conservative.
[00:34:53.372 --> 00:34:55.976]  We gotta choose Union or the Governor.
[00:34:56.516 --> 00:34:56.857]  No!
[00:34:57.337 --> 00:35:01.342]  No, that's only one part of the larger equation!
[00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:04.480]  Stop letting them set the parameters!
[00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:06.621]  Have you heard, get outside the box?
[00:35:07.502 --> 00:35:13.985]  The globalists are all about putting you in smaller and smaller boxes and what's comfortable to talk about and what's comfortable to debate.
[00:35:14.005 --> 00:35:24.450]  I mean, I see people all the time at restaurants or places having political discussions and they always discuss the most mindless political things and find things they agree on and then sit there and agree with each other.
[00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.531]  It's always some mindless pap.
[00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:35.658]  You know, some talking point that's been put out for years that they're repeating and feeling like they're big, smart, political insiders discussing a baseball game or something.
[00:35:35.918 --> 00:35:42.904]  Hey, you're not in the baseball team, you're not making the $10 million a year, and you're not in the political process, you're discussing it.
[00:35:43.144 --> 00:35:45.346]  Because that political process is rigged!
[00:35:46.343 --> 00:35:50.166]  The only way to be really involved politically is to know how the game really works.
[00:35:50.767 --> 00:35:51.007]  Okay?
[00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:55.130]  But you are obsessed and watching projections on the cave wall.
[00:35:55.451 --> 00:35:57.973]  I go back to Plato's The Cave allegory.
[00:35:59.394 --> 00:35:59.714]  Okay?
[00:35:59.974 --> 00:36:00.835]  Go up top!
[00:36:00.935 --> 00:36:02.376]  See the real world, folks!
[00:36:02.917 --> 00:36:07.661]  Not a projection where you're chained up in a cave watching puppet shows, okay?
[00:36:08.542 --> 00:36:09.723]  That's what I'm telling you here!
[00:36:09.903 --> 00:36:12.205]  There's a whole universe, a whole world going on!
[00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:22.465]  And we allow the control freaks who know how humans operate, but instead of using that information to further empower people, they don't like that.
[00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:27.146]  They don't enjoy seeing people enlightened and awakening.
[00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:29.767]  They like knowing your weaknesses.
[00:36:30.007 --> 00:36:31.247]  They like pushing your buttons.
[00:36:31.488 --> 00:36:32.728]  They like pulling your chain.
[00:36:34.729 --> 00:36:36.969]  It's to the power of infinity.
[00:36:37.629 --> 00:36:41.971]  We all work with people, know people who play high school mind games.
[00:36:44.082 --> 00:36:52.506]  And you'll always notice more successful people are just about business and don't really play the mind games, but a lot of times you just kind of put up with it because people can't help it.
[00:36:52.886 --> 00:36:55.768]  Most people that play little mind games aren't even aware they're doing it.
[00:36:56.268 --> 00:36:57.829]  And I guess we all do it to some extent.
[00:36:58.209 --> 00:37:03.152]  But the globalists consciously play mind games with people, and they enjoy punching your buttons.
[00:37:03.592 --> 00:37:05.073]  They enjoy deceiving you.
[00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:07.254]  You know what I enjoy?
[00:37:07.314 --> 00:37:09.455]  I enjoy seeing people wake up and routing these people.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.922]  I want to see unbridled human potential.
[00:37:14.263 --> 00:37:15.364]  I am a phantom man.
[00:37:16.325 --> 00:37:23.972]  And Hollywood puts out The Devil's Advocate where Satan incarnate is a phantom man and believes in humanity.
[00:37:24.793 --> 00:37:25.794]  What a lie!
[00:37:26.254 --> 00:37:28.917]  The devil comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:37:29.277 --> 00:37:34.102]  Even if you don't believe in a physical galactic entity of malevolent destruction.
[00:37:35.134 --> 00:37:37.316]  The globalists hate beauty.
[00:37:37.816 --> 00:37:42.420]  Their fetishes, what they're obsessed with is ruining beautiful, innocent things.
[00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.262]  They love it!
[00:37:44.782 --> 00:37:47.484]  Well, I'll tell you one thing.
[00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:51.748]  My gut, my soul, everything I am is turned against them.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.181]  My entire being is focused down on them.
[00:37:57.922 --> 00:38:16.588]  And it's so frustrating that when you're good, but know these secrets, you see how worm-like and weak they are, and then you watch the world and people that are unconscious selling their souls, their name, everything they are, for ashes, for things that don't matter at the end of the day.
[00:38:18.449 --> 00:38:19.449]  And none of us are perfect.
[00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:20.650]  All of us fall into that trap.
[00:38:22.898 --> 00:38:24.579]  Look at the Charlie Sheen situation.
[00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:26.859]  Charlie Sheen, six and a half years ago, calls me.
[00:38:26.899 --> 00:38:28.180]  I'm talking to him three or four months.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.520]  He comes on air for 9-11 Truth in early 2006.
[00:38:32.001 --> 00:38:44.145]  He gets a lot of attention to it because he was well-spoken, but also his baggage made the media attack him on it, which actually backfired on them, and they realized it was backfiring, so it went from the biggest news story to nothing overnight.
[00:38:45.319 --> 00:38:46.400]  Then I become his friend.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.483]  He's clean, he's married, he's not involved in drugs.
[00:38:49.883 --> 00:38:52.686]  Then he goes off the rails, like a drowning man.
[00:38:52.726 --> 00:38:54.268]  He says, come out and see me, I need help.
[00:38:55.269 --> 00:38:55.989]  I go out there.
[00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:02.796]  He's off drugs, getting clean, but in a manic phase, I get him on the air to say, hey, let's talk about how you're off drugs, and it's positive.
[00:39:04.838 --> 00:39:08.722]  And then I let him do what he did on air, when in hindsight, I should have stopped it probably.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.001]  And right after it happened, I said, well, you better apologize and back off of this.
[00:39:13.021 --> 00:39:14.442]  I said, they're going to fire you.
[00:39:14.462 --> 00:39:16.682]  And he said, well, I don't care if they do, but I don't think they will.
[00:39:16.922 --> 00:39:18.223]  And I said, yeah, they are, man.
[00:39:20.103 --> 00:39:23.144]  Because they can't have you basically standing up against them.
[00:39:24.765 --> 00:39:32.408]  And maybe he's right in what he's doing, but now under the stress and the people he's got around him, the yes men, Charlie doesn't want people right now around him.
[00:39:32.428 --> 00:39:33.588]  They'll sit there and argue with him.
[00:39:38.117 --> 00:39:39.937]  But I don't sit there and judge Charlie.
[00:39:39.997 --> 00:39:41.518]  He is a human like all of us.
[00:39:41.538 --> 00:39:42.758]  Did he kill a million Iraqis?
[00:39:43.518 --> 00:39:46.799]  Is he involved using information to abuse and control people?
[00:39:46.879 --> 00:39:47.059]  No.
[00:39:47.479 --> 00:39:50.300]  At his heart, he's a good gentlemanly guy.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.680]  Everybody that knows him has said that.
[00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.661]  At his core, he's a good man.
[00:39:56.721 --> 00:39:57.681]  But is he lost?
[00:39:58.061 --> 00:39:59.142]  Is he the prodigal son?
[00:39:59.242 --> 00:40:00.062]  Is he going to come back?
[00:40:00.362 --> 00:40:00.922]  Maybe not!
[00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:20.681]  I got to know Charlie and like him as the person, but then I could see the power of that Hollywood image that the globalists use all those other Hollywood people to push their agendas on the population.
[00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:29.088]  Think what would happen if we had a rebellion of the Hollywood people in that corrupt, decadent system against the New World Order.
[00:40:29.548 --> 00:40:31.810]  It could totally turn the tide against the globalists.
[00:40:33.188 --> 00:40:35.430]  And that's why they do surveil the Hollywood people.
[00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.053]  That's why they are using psychotronic weapons on them.
[00:40:38.293 --> 00:40:40.135]  That's why they are slipping them Mickeys.
[00:40:41.716 --> 00:40:47.101]  So many Hollywood stars are murdered for the insurance money or murdered by their managers.
[00:40:48.743 --> 00:40:50.905]  It is a hellish system they live under.
[00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:52.547]  And so pray for Charlie Sheen.
[00:40:58.254 --> 00:41:00.296]  In fact, I was on Coast to Coast AM last night.
[00:41:00.316 --> 00:41:04.481]  They wanted me to come on and talk about Charlie some, and then some other issues, and I'm gonna get into those in a moment.
[00:41:04.741 --> 00:41:08.825]  But, I mean, Charlie is an example of humanity and the highs and lows it can have.
[00:41:09.766 --> 00:41:14.412]  And I was reading the news about Charlie before I went on, and I saw men co-star Holland Taylor.
[00:41:15.595 --> 00:41:16.996]  Defends Charlie Sheen.
[00:41:18.217 --> 00:41:18.757]  While U.S.
[00:41:18.777 --> 00:41:27.202]  television network CBS is keeping mum about Charlie Sheen, one of his co-stars has been speaking out and sharing kind words about the embattled actor.
[00:41:27.462 --> 00:41:30.284]  Two-and-a-half men star Holland Taylor defended the actor.
[00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:33.845]  She has worked with since the show began in 2003.
[00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:40.586]  Charlie was cordial and polite with all of the cast, all of his castmates and crew, sometimes even courtly.
[00:41:41.266 --> 00:41:42.066]  And that's how he is.
[00:41:42.406 --> 00:41:54.769]  Unbelievably generous and polite and gentlemanly and, you know, giving homeless people thousand-dollar bills and giving money to charity and helping people.
[00:41:55.728 --> 00:41:59.191]  You know, just incredible, but then he's also got a wild side.
[00:41:59.571 --> 00:42:04.656]  Charlie was cordial and polite with all the castmates and crew, sometimes even courtly, and always witty.
[00:42:04.836 --> 00:42:05.597]  Yeah, very smart.
[00:42:06.558 --> 00:42:15.166]  I mean, all of his antics on these videocasts are just him being in their face, and it comes off, some of it is cartoonish.
[00:42:15.546 --> 00:42:17.127]  In person, he's really smart and witty.
[00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.792]  Taylor said Tuesday in an email to the Associated Press,
[00:42:23.117 --> 00:42:27.539]  We watch movies at his house occasionally, warm evenings with interesting, spirited conversation.
[00:42:27.859 --> 00:42:28.920]  This is the guy I know.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:37.884]  In this very sad and complicated time, I really have no comment, she continued, beyond valuing my own history with Charlie and my abiding affection for him.
[00:42:40.726 --> 00:42:42.967]  And that's... that's pretty much...
[00:42:44.875 --> 00:42:57.406]  What I would say, I have some frustration that he is so locked in his battle with them and his anger that he is being over-the-top pretty much on purpose.
[00:42:58.146 --> 00:43:04.552]  But it's not an act, for the media wondering out there, and then I'm going to shift gears, but I just want to talk about this briefly.
[00:43:05.493 --> 00:43:06.774]  It's not an act, but it is.
[00:43:07.935 --> 00:43:10.998]  Basically, he's just letting himself throw it all in their face.
[00:43:13.044 --> 00:43:14.725]  I don't know if there's a method to the madness.
[00:43:16.865 --> 00:43:28.969]  It's like he's on a treadmill and I think the seven months of drugs hurt him at certain levels and kind of destabilized him and now he's in a manic phase and I just pray to God he doesn't go back on drugs.
[00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:34.471]  I pray because they are just waiting to destroy him, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:35.472 --> 00:43:39.513]  I mean, this is a guy who told me in his kitchen six years ago that he was born again Christian.
[00:43:41.195 --> 00:43:41.936]  And now look at him.
[00:43:42.236 --> 00:43:46.239]  I told him I'll pray for you the other night, and he said, what, you're going to pray to your sky god for me?
[00:43:46.259 --> 00:43:52.984]  And I said, man, you know there's more going on, Horatio, in heaven and earth than what's in your books.
[00:43:53.004 --> 00:43:54.566]  Will you guys pull up the Shakespeare quote?
[00:43:55.046 --> 00:43:56.988]  There's more in heaven and earth than in all your books.
[00:43:57.028 --> 00:43:58.569]  I think it says it to Horatio.
[00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:03.373]  I'm forgetting my Shakespeare because I'm still under the weather a bit.
[00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:10.398]  I mean, I feel God, I know God.
[00:44:10.418 --> 00:44:18.844]  And so the Charlie I know and love is the one that has a relationship with God.
[00:44:19.245 --> 00:44:26.070]  But I can't judge him now and throw him down and say, look at you, you're bad, you're a sinner, when I'm probably a bigger sinner in many ways.
[00:44:28.052 --> 00:44:29.673]  In different ways in my life.
[00:44:37.039 --> 00:44:37.820]  It's just incredible.
[00:44:38.422 --> 00:44:39.902]  I don't know what else to say on that front.
[00:44:39.922 --> 00:44:44.124]  I said I'd get into the Michael Moore situation, and I am going to do that.
[00:44:44.924 --> 00:44:48.045]  It's from Hamlet, and he's talking to Horatio.
[00:44:49.225 --> 00:44:52.646]  And therefore, as a stranger, give it welcome.
[00:44:52.807 --> 00:44:58.808]  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
[00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:06.491]  Horatio advised against it.
[00:45:08.035 --> 00:45:10.996]  Barge into Hamlet's conversation with Father's Ghost.
[00:45:11.597 --> 00:45:13.758]  See something as rotten in the state of Denmark.
[00:45:16.419 --> 00:45:17.919]  Man, I just can't get enough Shakespeare.
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:18.920]  Oh my gosh.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:28.204]  Have you seen Charlton Heston's rendition of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar?
[00:45:28.464 --> 00:45:29.024]  Oh man.
[00:45:30.465 --> 00:45:30.945]  Language.
[00:45:32.126 --> 00:45:34.447]  The power and the depth of the language.
[00:45:36.684 --> 00:45:40.947]  And then you hear something like Howard Stern doing flatulence jokes and it's just, it's obscene.
[00:45:41.587 --> 00:45:48.451]  Not that you're shocked by flatulence jokes or shocked by the sexy devil cheerleader.
[00:45:49.792 --> 00:45:53.134]  Once you had it, man, you realize it's like a dirt sandwich.
[00:45:54.615 --> 00:46:02.000]  Quantum mechanics, space travel, gardening, family, children,
[00:46:03.624 --> 00:46:15.102]  Adventures, rock climbing, deep sea diving, real risk-taking, boxing, real things that are human, that challenge you.
[00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:22.313]  Not just floundering around like a two-and-a-half-year-old that laughs if you tell him a flatulence joke.
[00:46:22.794 --> 00:46:41.985]  And I see grown men everywhere that I can't even communicate with, and it's almost like idiocracy that Mike Judge put out, where the guy's, you know, 300 years in the future with a dumbed-down public that can hardly talk, and he was kind of a low-grade moron in his day, but now he's the smartest guy on the planet, and he's in there talking to the judge in plain English, trying to defend himself, and the judge is going,
[00:46:42.685 --> 00:46:43.966]  Look, he knows how to read.
[00:46:44.046 --> 00:46:46.347]  Look, he's a, you know, he's a wimp.
[00:46:47.148 --> 00:46:49.489]  And they're all, I mean, it's just like, what?
[00:46:50.629 --> 00:46:55.072]  And the technocrats are up there publicly saying, OK, get the system set up.
[00:46:55.092 --> 00:46:56.673]  We're going to go ahead and wipe these people out.
[00:46:57.393 --> 00:46:58.534]  The globalists are so arrogant.
[00:46:58.554 --> 00:47:00.015]  They're like, Jones, you go ahead and warn them.
[00:47:00.275 --> 00:47:01.135]  These people are animals.
[00:47:01.415 --> 00:47:02.296]  We're going to wipe them out.
[00:47:02.676 --> 00:47:03.797]  I'm like, you're animals, too.
[00:47:04.926 --> 00:47:05.947]  Look at the way you live!
[00:47:05.967 --> 00:47:07.387]  Look at your taste!
[00:47:08.028 --> 00:47:11.749]  You globalists think you're going to stop killing when you've wiped us out?
[00:47:11.849 --> 00:47:12.150]  No.
[00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:17.952]  There can be two globalists in a high mountain keep 200 years from now.
[00:47:18.693 --> 00:47:26.197]  With life extension technology, through the cybernetic interfaces, you really still won't be what you originally were, so you're not really living forever.
[00:47:26.497 --> 00:47:32.480]  But a facsimile, a 3D hologram of who you were, will go on.
[00:47:33.522 --> 00:47:34.402]  An abomination.
[00:47:35.283 --> 00:47:42.745]  And you could have, you know, those two entities, basically, you know, the two globalists left, and they would be trying to kill each other.
[00:47:43.665 --> 00:47:46.246]  And find out where all the copies of the other were.
[00:47:46.806 --> 00:47:48.527]  You know, spread around the solar system.
[00:47:48.547 --> 00:47:56.269]  And they'd be having huge factories, launching drones into deep space, running from the other to seed their consciousness.
[00:47:56.609 --> 00:48:02.991]  And then a trillion year war as they run around trying to destroy the other replicant version of the other.
[00:48:03.973 --> 00:48:05.334]  I mean, this is what's going on.
[00:48:05.774 --> 00:48:06.994]  This is what they talk about.
[00:48:07.474 --> 00:48:25.761]  This is what's happening, not some nerd, you know, hawking over like a vampire, feeding on weak-minded people and creating a feedback loop engineered by people like Sumner Redstone to turn us into lower-than-animals so they can sweep us up.
[00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:30.921]  That's what's going on.
[00:48:31.742 --> 00:48:33.364]  That's what's happening in this world.
[00:48:33.584 --> 00:48:34.986]  They're laughing at you.
[00:48:35.626 --> 00:48:36.808]  They think it's funny.
[00:48:38.289 --> 00:48:39.190]  And it's not funny.
[00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:41.492]  It's not cute.
[00:48:47.178 --> 00:48:49.661]  Humanity is on the verge of committing suicide.
[00:48:53.476 --> 00:48:54.777]  That's basically what's happening.
[00:48:54.917 --> 00:49:05.243]  And civilizations have committed suicide many times, but this time we've got the power to commit Harry Carey, Shepaku, on the entire species.
[00:49:05.703 --> 00:49:10.206]  And I am not going to stand by idly and just watch it happen.
[00:49:10.326 --> 00:49:20.512]  I'm going to throw myself 110% against this and against the phony globalist churches with the 150-year-old doctrine that it's the end of the world, lay down to evil.
[00:49:20.793 --> 00:49:22.634]  That isn't in the Bible, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:23.334 --> 00:49:28.020]  That is the doctrine of the pus-filled gut of Satan.
[00:49:29.562 --> 00:49:33.387]  Filled with the rotten little bodies of all the children it's devoured.
[00:49:34.669 --> 00:49:37.092]  All the souls it's gobbled up.
[00:49:38.474 --> 00:49:41.218]  You know, Christ always talked at about 20 different levels.
[00:49:42.449 --> 00:49:44.451]  The simple minded would read it and get one meaning.
[00:49:45.152 --> 00:49:46.913]  Those that think they have wisdom would get another.
[00:49:47.814 --> 00:49:54.982]  But those that have the beginning of wisdom have the fear of God and can see the hundreds of meanings within the twenty meanings.
[00:49:55.943 --> 00:49:57.424]  But suffer the little children.
[00:49:57.884 --> 00:50:03.410]  It is better to tie a giant boulder around your neck and throw yourself in the deepest ocean than to harm one of them.
[00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:16.180]  Christ is talking about little children and retarded children and ignorant women and ignorant men, but he's more importantly talking about weak-minded people who are childlike.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:21.424]  Instead of trying to build their intellect up, you use that against them.
[00:50:21.464 --> 00:50:23.866]  You take their little hand and you
[00:50:24.286 --> 00:50:42.162]  Tell them you're taking them for some candy and some puppy dogs in the car and you take them and you chain them up and you rape them for three weeks and you shock them and you psychically feed off their screaming and their begging and their pain and when they finally go into a catatonic state, you strangle them.
[00:50:42.782 --> 00:50:45.466]  Well that's what the globalists are doing to all of humanity.
[00:50:45.786 --> 00:50:48.430]  And you are damned to Hades for all eternity.
[00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.172]  And there is a spiritual force.
[00:50:50.472 --> 00:50:51.193]  And it's real.
[00:50:51.434 --> 00:50:52.315]  And I can see it.
[00:50:52.635 --> 00:50:54.999]  And I know you're going straight to hell.
[00:50:56.581 --> 00:51:00.105]  My only hope is that we can save humanity from being sucked down with ya.
[00:51:01.397 --> 00:51:05.838]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.

[00:52:29.059 --> 00:52:30.079]  Could this really happen?
[00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:33.842]  Well, the man who created this video has been right about many predictions in his career.
[00:52:34.202 --> 00:52:40.286]  He was among the first to predict the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:52:40.486 --> 00:52:43.067]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.

[00:53:02.827 --> 00:53:03.967]  This is not a drill.
[00:53:04.067 --> 00:53:06.048]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:53:06.568 --> 00:53:08.149]  Gun sales are on a staggering pace.
[00:53:08.469 --> 00:53:15.591]  Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.

[00:53:53.373 --> 00:53:53.954]  Right now.
[00:54:05.595 --> 00:54:09.836]  Take a look out your window, there's a scene you ought to catch.
[00:54:09.916 --> 00:54:13.117]  Oh, sometimes.
[00:54:36.351 --> 00:54:38.533]  First he's in the back, now he's in the front!
[00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:06.677]  Oh, listen up!
[00:55:06.737 --> 00:55:07.097]  Listen!
[00:55:08.178 --> 00:55:09.999]  First... Why is that?
[00:55:10.059 --> 00:55:17.185]  Why can't people see the evil scumbags running on
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:44.686]  All over the place, leaving their droppings everywhere, wrecking everything, gibbering and giggling, and celebrating how blind everyone is.
[00:55:45.766 --> 00:55:49.689]  Treating you like a bunch of blind, deaf children.
[00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:57.133]  Alright, look, I said I'd get into Michael Moore, and I'm going to get into it more with Dr. Corsi coming up and get his view on it, but let me explain something.
[00:55:57.173 --> 00:55:57.734]  It's very simple.
[00:55:58.514 --> 00:56:04.538]  We're told either the governor of Wisconsin is good, and the Koch brothers are good, or they're bad.
[00:56:05.575 --> 00:56:09.118]  We're told either the unions are good and Obama's good or they're bad.
[00:56:11.940 --> 00:56:18.085]  Well, Obama was given four times the money by Wall Street that John McCain was.
[00:56:18.906 --> 00:56:20.447]  Does that mean John McCain was good?
[00:56:20.507 --> 00:56:25.692]  No, it means that they thought they could get further with Obama conning people than John McCain.
[00:56:27.533 --> 00:56:29.175]  You're like, how does that explain Michael Moore?
[00:56:29.615 --> 00:56:30.916]  It explains it right there!
[00:56:30.956 --> 00:56:32.257]  They own both sides!
[00:56:34.059 --> 00:56:34.259]  This
[00:56:37.692 --> 00:57:02.840]  SEIC group and these other organizations, in fact I had it right here in my stack, they're all running around taking over Bank of America in places, right target, wrong solution, and calling for higher taxes and saying our money is in there.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.121]  And a few of them are even saying this is banker bailout money.
[00:57:07.079 --> 00:57:13.968]  But they don't then go on to point out that government can never deliver and never does deliver.
[00:57:13.988 --> 00:57:17.292]  If you have a total communist system, most people end up starving to death.
[00:57:18.794 --> 00:57:21.577]  Because then you just have the party chiefs who become the new robber barons.
[00:57:22.398 --> 00:57:24.381]  And then they blame the free market system
[00:57:25.811 --> 00:57:27.853]  For what's happening in our economy and politically.
[00:57:27.933 --> 00:57:36.759]  No, it's big government that has bought in to the 1,500 plus quadrillion created by the private bankers.
[00:57:36.819 --> 00:57:38.961]  So that's where all your pension fund money went.
[00:57:39.421 --> 00:57:41.082]  That's where all the investment money went.
[00:57:41.382 --> 00:57:42.643]  That's where the economy went.
[00:57:42.964 --> 00:57:44.465]  It's globalism that did this.
[00:57:44.545 --> 00:57:47.427]  It's the unions, many of them, signing on to it.
[00:57:48.047 --> 00:57:51.130]  It's conservatives signing on to NAFTA and GATT.
[00:57:53.271 --> 00:57:53.992]  Our economy
[00:57:56.148 --> 00:57:57.709]  And I explained all this yesterday.
[00:57:57.829 --> 00:58:00.070]  I explained it all in crystal clarity.
[00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:05.592]  How you have the video of the union people saying you don't have a right to your own money to the defense contractors.
[00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:08.654]  And the guy's like, well I'm not sucking off the government largesse.
[00:58:08.994 --> 00:58:10.235]  I'm a defense contractor.
[00:58:10.315 --> 00:58:10.555]  What?
[00:58:11.792 --> 00:58:12.112]  What?
[00:58:13.053 --> 00:58:15.054]  I was criticizing both, saying, see?
[00:58:16.555 --> 00:58:22.858]  More than half the population is either on government dole, government jobs, government welfare, or government contracts.
[00:58:23.258 --> 00:58:26.440]  That is a recipe for total collapse of society.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.481]  That's an economic fact.
[00:58:29.041 --> 00:58:32.883]  And you union people are like, more taxes, more government, get the bankers!
[00:58:33.303 --> 00:58:35.665]  The stinking bankers want big government.
[00:58:36.045 --> 00:58:39.767]  The insurance companies owned by the banks wrote the health care plan, idiots!
[00:58:44.435 --> 00:58:48.298]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.761 --> 00:58:51.902]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:58:51.922 --> 00:58:58.607]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:01.150]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:06.614]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:59:06.794 --> 00:59:09.577]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:59:09.837 --> 00:59:11.899]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:59:12.139 --> 00:59:18.063]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:59:18.383 --> 00:59:21.585]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:59:21.765 --> 00:59:27.289]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:28.850]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:30.391]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:59:30.491 --> 00:59:33.032]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:59:33.173 --> 00:59:37.215]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:59:37.395 --> 00:59:39.417]  You can find the video at www.
[00:59:40.177 --> 00:59:41.878]  End of America 3.com.
[00:59:41.998 --> 00:59:42.978]  That's End of America.
[00:59:43.118 --> 00:59:44.459]  The number 3.com.
[00:59:44.579 --> 00:59:48.301]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:48.461 --> 00:59:50.202]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[00:59:53.663 --> 00:59:55.584]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.044 --> 00:59:58.826]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:09.520]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:10.961]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:12.681]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:16.962]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.483 --> 01:00:21.544]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.344 --> 01:00:27.905]  Alright, Dr. Jerome Corsi on the North American Union, on his view on these unions and what's happening.
[01:00:28.505 --> 01:00:31.526]  It's all coming up with Dr. Jerome Corsi, then Lindsey Williams.
[01:00:32.106 --> 01:00:43.128]  I haven't even gotten to that audio clip of Lindsey Williams predicting yet, but I'll do that ahead of Williams coming on in the next hour, but we did find the clip, the crew did.
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.642]  Look, there's a lot of problems with what Michael Moore is saying.
[01:00:50.043 --> 01:00:54.045]  He's saying that people's wealth in America is a national resource.
[01:00:54.546 --> 01:01:06.774]  The problem is the globalists are offshore and above the law, and they fool the general public into wanting socialism, and in every case, socialism's created, and the money is then conduited offshore to the bankers who openly lobby for it.
[01:01:07.114 --> 01:01:08.295]  They're not free market.
[01:01:08.335 --> 01:01:13.719]  They're robber baron criminals that come in and lobby government.
[01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:33.940]  to create a social system to get people domesticated so they can use that domesticated mass to go menace the rest of the economy and the rest of the middle class and the nouveau riche into paying more and more taxes that the lion's share of go to the select defense contractors, banks, and insurance companies.
[01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:39.964]  And then chicken feeds given to the servile, dumbed-down mass minions.
[01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:43.034]  Now, that's very simple.
[01:01:43.114 --> 01:01:44.694]  If you can't understand that, I'm sorry.
[01:01:45.415 --> 01:01:52.397]  I got emails and stuff and saw some comments on the website even, people saying, why are you bashing Michael Moore?
[01:01:52.457 --> 01:01:53.858]  Well, gee, he's a hypocrite.
[01:01:54.158 --> 01:01:58.340]  He's been caught owning all these big defense stocks over and over again while he bashes them.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:01:59.580]  I wouldn't own any of those stocks.
[01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:01.941]  I don't own any biometric prison stocks.
[01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:02.802]  I own no stock.
[01:02:03.612 --> 01:02:04.692]  Because it's all a fraud.
[01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.593]  That's my moral decision.
[01:02:06.613 --> 01:02:13.316]  I'm not on some high horse, but he runs around, it's like Rush Limbaugh saying, minimum sentences for cocaine.
[01:02:13.336 --> 01:02:16.638]  If you get caught with cocaine or heroin, minimum 15 year sentence.
[01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:26.302]  Then he's caught with synthetic heroin, and commits massive felonies, and if some street kid got caught with it, 15 years in prison, nothing happens to him.
[01:02:26.982 --> 01:02:28.283]  Nothing should have happened to you.
[01:02:28.503 --> 01:02:29.644]  You had a back injury.
[01:02:29.884 --> 01:02:30.784]  You got addicted.
[01:02:31.244 --> 01:02:32.005]  It's a disease.
[01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:36.719]  We shouldn't make it illegal and send you to prison, college for criminals.
[01:02:37.859 --> 01:02:40.780]  I shouldn't have to pay to put you in there, Mr. Libertarian Limbaugh.
[01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:42.101]  Okay?
[01:02:42.521 --> 01:02:49.244]  I feel sorry for you, but don't be a big, fat hypocrite like the self-propelled blubber butt.
[01:02:50.444 --> 01:02:52.705]  And people are like, don't be a hypocrite, Alex, you're a little overweight.
[01:02:53.085 --> 01:02:53.486]  Oh, really?
[01:02:53.726 --> 01:02:54.846]  I'm a little overweight, folks?
[01:02:54.986 --> 01:02:56.487]  I'm about 20 pounds overweight.
[01:02:57.007 --> 01:03:00.108]  I'm not in great shape, but I can run two miles, I can bench press 300 pounds.
[01:03:00.368 --> 01:03:01.429]  I got a little bitty beer belly.
[01:03:02.526 --> 01:03:04.868]  I'm not 600 pounds like him.
[01:03:04.928 --> 01:03:06.349]  I'm 230 pounds.
[01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:08.451]  It doesn't matter what I look like, though.
[01:03:08.672 --> 01:03:09.853]  I ought to gain 500 pounds.
[01:03:09.893 --> 01:03:10.353]  I don't care.
[01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.435]  The point is he's psychically a blubber butt.
[01:03:12.975 --> 01:03:14.497]  He's feeding off of the trough.
[01:03:16.178 --> 01:03:26.147]  And he sits there, he sits there in everybody's face saying, the bankers, the bankers, it's our money.
[01:03:26.488 --> 01:03:27.509]  Yes, it's our money.
[01:03:28.356 --> 01:03:29.917]  But is he calling for auditing the Fed?
[01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:33.918]  Is he calling for writing off the 1.5 quadrillion that we don't owe?
[01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:34.498]  No.
[01:03:35.219 --> 01:03:43.342]  He's calling for increased taxes, which is exactly what the Democrats and the bankers and the head of the Federal Reserve has called for higher taxes.
[01:03:43.842 --> 01:03:44.522]  Bernanke.
[01:03:44.962 --> 01:03:45.403]  All of them.
[01:03:45.443 --> 01:03:46.263]  That's what they want.
[01:03:46.543 --> 01:03:48.084]  I mean, here's the news articles right here.
[01:03:48.404 --> 01:03:50.905]  Socialist Storm Bank of America called for taxes.
[01:03:52.014 --> 01:04:06.966]  And it's the SEIU, NPA, and DNC, Democratic Socialists of America, openly working for George Soros and Obama, and they go take over a Bank of America and say, it's the bankers, it's the bankers, and they know that 99% of Americans are angry at the bankers.
[01:04:07.406 --> 01:04:09.568]  Left or right, they're awake, so it's a bait and switch.
[01:04:09.588 --> 01:04:10.749]  People go, yeah, get them!
[01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:13.996]  Their answer is raise taxes!
[01:04:14.396 --> 01:04:17.978]  The very banker heads are lobbying for that because they're going to get the money!
[01:04:18.678 --> 01:04:23.101]  You think these disheveled, poor, well-meaning union people and government workers?
[01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:27.363]  Do you think they are going to get any of the cream?
[01:04:27.383 --> 01:04:27.423]  No!
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:39.205]  You're not going to get the government contracts like George Soros' $250 million deal in alternative energy programs that Obama's serving out?
[01:04:39.466 --> 01:04:40.907]  And who's on the board of this new company?
[01:04:41.247 --> 01:04:44.709]  Madeleine Albright and all these other fat cats that help set up the energy policy?
[01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.790]  You idiots!
[01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:51.794]  Hey, people at SCE, with these unions, you wanted jobs?
[01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:55.016]  You shouldn't have let your union bosses get behind NAFTA and GATT.
[01:04:55.336 --> 01:04:57.978]  And same thing for you moron mainline conservatives.
[01:04:58.858 --> 01:04:59.759]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:08.567]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:05:08.927 --> 01:05:11.148]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:05:11.588 --> 01:05:20.389]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February, and pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:05:20.629 --> 01:05:28.531]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:05:28.871 --> 01:05:29.991]  Move quickly while you can
[01:05:29.991 --> 01:05:30.351]  I think so.
[01:06:04.497 --> 01:06:05.418]  Tyranny is here.
[01:06:05.758 --> 01:06:09.420]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.942]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:06:12.102 --> 01:06:17.365]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:06:17.805 --> 01:06:24.049]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:06:24.449 --> 01:06:29.993]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:06:30.413 --> 01:06:34.095]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.

[01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.845]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:50.826]  It's here.

[01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:53.336]  So help fill our war chest with treasure and get powerful info treasure in return and spread it to the four winds, air the films on AXS TV, make copies of all my documentary films, continue to ram them down the throat of the New World Order.
[01:11:53.656 --> 01:11:59.018]  We are destroying the enemy every day and gaining ground on them and they are scared and we can feel the blood running out of them.
[01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:08.965]  Now, we're going to Dr. Jerome Corsi here in a moment with Obama's signature creates continental perimeter, move described as key step in advance of North American Union.
[01:12:10.556 --> 01:12:13.859]  We also are going to get into more and more bizarre mainstream articles.
[01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.094]  Also, warning of food riots in the UK.
[01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.235]  We told you that eight years ago.
[01:12:33.295 --> 01:12:34.056]  It's all been planned.
[01:12:34.436 --> 01:12:46.006]  But first, I want to get Corsi's take on Lindsey Williams, who had Ken Fromm, the head of Atlantic Richfield, tell him five months ago as he was dying of cancer that oil would go to 150 to 200 with a staged globalist
[01:12:48.908 --> 01:12:58.796]  George Soros style revolution, doesn't mean the revolution isn't real, it's just triggered by the globalists, to drive up oil prices, kill the Arabs financially, then killing the dollar.
[01:12:59.336 --> 01:13:04.901]  Now you see Wall Street Journal saying the end of the dollar is here, oh it's a good thing.
[01:13:04.921 --> 01:13:07.563]  That's like saying, oh you got brain cancer, that's a good thing.
[01:13:08.363 --> 01:13:12.504]  Uh, we're gonna get Dr. Corsi, who's also really an economics expert, to take on that.
[01:13:12.804 --> 01:13:16.985]  But so he can hear Lindsey Williams from October 21st on this show.
[01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:21.447]  He went into a lot more detail, but I'll play a short clip of it, because Lindsey Williams is joining us next hour.
[01:13:21.747 --> 01:13:25.808]  Here is that clip of him laying it out, not just from Ken Frum, who died a month later,
[01:13:26.488 --> 01:13:42.634]  But from his other, and I know the man's name, and we've actually called him, I'll leave that out of it, so has Dr. Monteith, who is an even bigger CEO of a big three, confirmed it and laughed with pleasure, and said, you go ahead and tell the slaves, there's nothing they can do to stop us.
[01:13:43.034 --> 01:13:47.036]  And now exactly what he told Pastor Williams is now happening.
[01:13:47.236 --> 01:13:47.896]  Here's that clip.
[01:13:48.476 --> 01:13:53.744]  With their crude oil prices, this means that their program is on schedule.
[01:13:54.105 --> 01:13:58.351]  They're doing exactly what they've been telling me over these years they were going to do.
[01:13:58.371 --> 01:13:58.751]  Here it is.
[01:13:59.528 --> 01:14:00.128]  Here's the price.
[01:14:00.548 --> 01:14:07.811]  Crude oil is going back to $152,200 a barrel.
[01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:13.232]  Gasoline at the gas pump will be $4 to $5 a gallon.
[01:14:13.752 --> 01:14:17.914]  This is going to contrive massive inflation.
[01:14:18.314 --> 01:14:21.215]  Can you imagine what this is going to do to airline fares?
[01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:23.216]  Okay, it goes on and on.
[01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:41.692]  Meanwhile, the Fed is oblivious, saying there's no inflation.
[01:14:41.712 --> 01:14:43.213]  Inflation's rearing up everywhere.
[01:14:43.573 --> 01:14:46.695]  It's triggering many of the riots that the globalists, then, are using.
[01:14:47.196 --> 01:14:56.041]  Dr. Corsi, what's your take on my last five-minute rant and Lindsey Williams' prediction, one of many coming true with precision?
[01:14:56.382 --> 01:14:59.484]  Well, I hope you'll... I've got great respect for Lindsey Williams.
[01:14:59.564 --> 01:15:02.325]  I hope you'll give him my best regards when he's on in the next segment.
[01:15:03.266 --> 01:15:04.387]  I really agree
[01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:11.531]  I predicted when I wrote Black Gold Stranglehold that we would hit $100 a barrel oil.
[01:15:11.551 --> 01:15:15.473]  That was about in 2005, and that prediction was ridiculed then.
[01:15:16.194 --> 01:15:21.956]  We hit $148 a barrel in July 2008, and I agree with Lindsey Williams.
[01:15:21.996 --> 01:15:23.357]  We're headed back to that level.
[01:15:23.757 --> 01:15:25.638]  We'll be lucky if it doesn't go higher than $148 a barrel.
[01:15:29.318 --> 01:15:37.341]  Now, what's your view, before we shift gears into the main reason you're here, North American Union, on what's happening in the Middle East?
[01:15:37.361 --> 01:15:47.185]  You notice it's all the key choke points on the waterways, and we know George Soros' people are in there, Google's in there, NSA, MI6, SAS.
[01:15:47.565 --> 01:15:53.068]  I mean, there's no... and CNN's hailing it, Glenn Beck's being criticized for staying at stage.
[01:15:53.408 --> 01:15:54.888]  Dr. Corsi, what's your view on this?
[01:15:54.908 --> 01:15:56.249]  Well, and I agree with you.
[01:15:56.289 --> 01:15:58.750]  Look, the George Soros funding of
[01:15:59.528 --> 01:16:04.512]  Causes around the world against the United States are notorious.
[01:16:05.112 --> 01:16:11.857]  And the manipulation of oil, which is being done by OPEC, the globalists have manipulated oil for a long time.
[01:16:11.917 --> 01:16:20.083]  Barack Obama, if you recall when he campaigned, said he welcomed the high price of oil because he thought he'd move people to green energy.
[01:16:20.103 --> 01:16:25.127]  And I think really Barack Obama had the globalist agenda in heart, and that is he knew that it would
[01:16:25.871 --> 01:16:43.534]  Devastate the United States economy, high prices of oil and natural gas, that it would destroy industrial activity and push us back into a, you know, agenda 21 type low growth, if not population decline pattern, which the globalists have wanted for decades.
[01:16:44.435 --> 01:16:50.136]  We've got abundant natural gas and oil here in the United States, offshore, in Alaska.
[01:16:51.156 --> 01:16:51.956]  I've maintained
[01:16:52.645 --> 01:16:55.323]  For a long time that oil is abiotic.
[01:16:55.403 --> 01:16:55.786]  It's not...
[01:16:56.573 --> 01:16:57.454]  Dinosaur soup.
[01:16:57.534 --> 01:16:59.135]  It's not created by fossils.
[01:16:59.175 --> 01:17:00.836]  Well, we know now that's being proven.
[01:17:01.036 --> 01:17:07.681]  Not just you writing about it a decade ago with all the scientists you interviewed, but now all the oil wells, most of them around the world, keep filling back up.
[01:17:08.181 --> 01:17:09.502]  And look how deep they are.
[01:17:09.562 --> 01:17:14.086]  Look at this deep water horizon, which blew with such tremendous pressure.
[01:17:14.166 --> 01:17:15.567]  It was almost through the crust.
[01:17:16.127 --> 01:17:21.731]  Right, and we're down, you know, there are five, six, seven miles below the surface of the water.
[01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:33.372]  The Russians, the Soviets at the end of World War II knew that oil was a deep energy resource, that it was not created by sedimentary rock.
[01:17:33.832 --> 01:17:39.194]  You know, it's not the case that all the dinosaurs herded in Saudi Arabia and died in the Big Heap at the end of the Mesozoic.
[01:17:40.454 --> 01:17:44.836]  You know, underneath the oil... No, the crust is just thinner there, so it's easier to get at.
[01:17:46.101 --> 01:17:51.947]  They decided they were going to precede the elephants, so they decided to go to the Great Hunting Ground and to die all in a big heap.
[01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.708]  That's not how we got oil in the Middle East.
[01:17:54.589 --> 01:18:04.418]  If you take a look at the studies of the bedrock fractures underneath the oil fields in Saudi Arabia, the oil fields are right on top of the bedrock fractures.
[01:18:04.438 --> 01:18:11.145]  That's where the oil has seeped up from being created in the mantle of the earth and pools in these sedimentary rocks.
[01:18:11.775 --> 01:18:14.596]  Well, we have abundant oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
[01:18:14.636 --> 01:18:17.957]  A great meteor hit that at the end of the Mesozoic Era.
[01:18:17.997 --> 01:18:18.637]  We know that.
[01:18:18.657 --> 01:18:20.778]  It deeply fractured the bedrock of the Gulf.
[01:18:21.298 --> 01:18:23.479]  And the Gulf, as a result, is filled with oil.
[01:18:24.259 --> 01:18:25.439]  We're going to find abundant oil.
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:28.440]  Three quarters of the world is filled with water.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:31.441]  We've barely looked under the oceans for oil.
[01:18:31.481 --> 01:18:38.344]  You know, we'll be having nuclear batteries driving our cars before we ever come close to running out of oil.
[01:18:38.984 --> 01:18:39.364]  But yet,
[01:18:40.094 --> 01:18:50.283]  The globalists, the Barack Obamas of the world, the George Soros's, do not want the United States of America to have abundant cheap energy, which we could have.
[01:18:50.303 --> 01:18:58.110]  It's also a deep, dark secret that the oil companies fund the environmentalists, and they have a big game on.
[01:18:58.671 --> 01:19:03.335]  You know, British Petroleum has this big ad campaign, BP Beyond Petroleum.
[01:19:03.835 --> 01:19:04.556]  It's a joke that
[01:19:05.788 --> 01:19:07.510]  Well, they're creating artificial scarcity.
[01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:11.174]  It's just like George Soros gets the sweetheart deals with Obama.
[01:19:11.594 --> 01:19:14.738]  GE and Soros are the only ones allowed to build new power plants.
[01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:16.660]  All their competition gets shut down.
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:25.990]  That's just the mafia model, like the 1,040 health care waivers to their buddies who don't have to get the health care for their employees, an unfair trade advantage.
[01:19:26.010 --> 01:19:27.812]  This is just Chicago mafia system.
[01:19:28.252 --> 01:19:28.713]  I agree.
[01:19:28.753 --> 01:19:38.541]  And, you know, look, also, what you've got going on, Alex, is that if people are convinced that oil is fossil fuel, there are only so many fossils, so there can only be so much oil.
[01:19:39.162 --> 01:19:44.347]  And that's where this whole conspiracy to make people think oil is rare starts.
[01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:46.911]  Absolutely, Dr. Corsi, stay there.
[01:19:46.971 --> 01:19:50.874]  By the way, this is not an alternative theory about the abiotic oil, okay?
[01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:56.378]  It's an absolute fact that oil does not come from dead dinosaurs, okay?
[01:19:57.018 --> 01:20:00.641]  We'll be right back with Dr. Jerome Corsi to get into the North American Union.
[01:20:00.781 --> 01:20:07.025]  Don't you just laugh every time the news plays another story about a foreclosure bank or attorney under investigation, bankrupted or being sued?
[01:20:07.365 --> 01:20:12.889]  Zero Debt has a program that stops foreclosure, guaranteed for at least two years, without payments or attorneys.
[01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:18.657]  In fact, we show our members how to get the banks to pay their taxes and insurance while they stonewall the bank's collection process.
[01:20:18.818 --> 01:20:23.405]  We show you how it's possible to quiet the title in your name by using the bank's very own foreclosure process.
[01:20:23.605 --> 01:20:25.027]  Loan modification is a joke.
[01:20:25.167 --> 01:20:28.793]  The banks use that to take your money with nothing in return and keeping you in default.
[01:20:28.973 --> 01:20:30.034]  You've heard our ad before.
[01:20:30.134 --> 01:20:32.776]  We are not investors, bankers, attorneys, or real estate agents.

[01:20:58.677 --> 01:21:00.278]  Guaranteed to stop foreclosure.
[01:21:00.619 --> 01:21:02.900]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.182]  We are part of a New World Order.
[01:21:05.202 --> 01:21:08.124]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[01:21:08.525 --> 01:21:13.308]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[01:21:13.649 --> 01:21:17.832]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[01:21:18.152 --> 01:21:20.496]  It means all the world under their control.
[01:21:20.596 --> 01:21:23.019]  The United Nations would take over America.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.944]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[01:21:26.304 --> 01:21:33.896]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[01:21:34.216 --> 01:21:39.499]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[01:21:39.619 --> 01:21:42.420]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:45.902]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[01:21:46.142 --> 01:21:47.082]  And I got news for you.
[01:21:47.222 --> 01:21:48.543]  You're everyone else.

[01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:05.884]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:22:06.364 --> 01:22:14.126]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:22:14.466 --> 01:22:22.308]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:22:22.628 --> 01:22:27.390]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:32.452]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:22:32.952 --> 01:22:36.814]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:22:37.294 --> 01:22:38.315]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:24:06.095 --> 01:24:18.047]  Okay, we got about 25 minutes or so, or a little less, left with Dr. Corsi, and this is a short segment, long one coming up, but I wanted to get into the main reason we have him here today, so we can then hurry and get into the unions.
[01:24:18.067 --> 01:24:21.871]  But you know what, we'll get into the North American Union stuff in the next segment.
[01:24:21.891 --> 01:24:23.853]  In this short segment, let's get into the unions.
[01:24:24.294 --> 01:24:26.116]  Dr. Corsi, the way I see this is...
[01:24:27.483 --> 01:24:32.709]  You've got the big mega banks that are openly globalists that have stolen trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:24:32.829 --> 01:24:34.551]  They've gotten the government of the U.S.
[01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:38.936]  and other countries to sign on to their derivatives that admittedly we don't owe.
[01:24:39.957 --> 01:24:41.779]  And so now austerity is here.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:47.081]  And so, just like a third world country, they're cutting the unions, they're cutting the government pay.
[01:24:47.701 --> 01:25:10.665]  But still, some of the unions are corrupt, they bet on the wrong globalist team, they certainly don't have a right to my money, and now Obama has his admitted controlled unions, and I have the news articles right here where SEIU went in, you know, and took over the Bank of America building, and they're calling for higher taxes, but then the taxes end up going to the bankers,
[01:25:11.405 --> 01:25:16.904]  And these poor, useful idiots think they're their, you know, you've got, you've got...
[01:25:18.365 --> 01:25:22.188]  Michael Moore is saying 400 people have more money than 50% of the country.
[01:25:22.748 --> 01:25:32.494]  Yeah, but those 400 people are actually lobbying a lot of them to have the dumbed down horde come take the money from the other 49% plus that they're not talking about.
[01:25:32.514 --> 01:25:47.104]  I mean, this is such a simple equation that globalism gives out this chicken feed to have this domesticated mass to be used as a weapon to control the government to make sure big government's there so crony capitalism can control things through government.
[01:25:47.344 --> 01:25:48.225]  What's your view on this?
[01:25:48.305 --> 01:25:51.128]  Well, look, here's where I'm going to start.
[01:25:52.269 --> 01:25:53.951]  Your point about the unions is correct.
[01:25:54.131 --> 01:25:55.513]  I come from a union family.
[01:25:55.573 --> 01:25:58.215]  My father was with the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.
[01:25:58.255 --> 01:26:00.398]  He helped to create the United Transportation Union.
[01:26:01.259 --> 01:26:08.346]  The unions today are nothing what the unions were in the 30s, 40s, 50s, and even 60s in the United States.
[01:26:08.887 --> 01:26:09.928]  Today the unions are
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:17.802]  More or less, kind of like, got on, they have on this kind of almost mafia kind of organized crime game.
[01:26:19.022 --> 01:26:20.222]  There's no collective bargaining.
[01:26:20.262 --> 01:26:21.603]  The unions get into power.
[01:26:21.643 --> 01:26:23.323]  They take over teachers.
[01:26:23.383 --> 01:26:24.944]  Let's say teachers in Wisconsin.
[01:26:25.544 --> 01:26:29.265]  And then they want it to be you can't be a teacher unless you join the union.
[01:26:29.765 --> 01:26:31.426]  And the union is going to take part of your pay.
[01:26:31.446 --> 01:26:32.846]  That's your union dues.
[01:26:32.886 --> 01:26:33.667]  You don't have a choice.
[01:26:33.707 --> 01:26:34.947]  You pay your union dues.
[01:26:35.627 --> 01:26:42.589]  Then the union decides to put that money, a good portion of it, into Democratic Party political campaigns.
[01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:46.250]  You have no choice about where your money goes into political campaigns.
[01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.911]  And then the Democrats give you an afternoon gap.
[01:26:48.507 --> 01:27:00.096]  That's right, and the Democrats get into power, and then the Democratic governors vote to the unions, more and more pay for their current benefits, pension benefits, whatever the union wants.
[01:27:00.657 --> 01:27:07.823]  Because again, the governors, especially with pension benefits, know it's going to come out of some future generations and some other governor's budget.
[01:27:08.563 --> 01:27:17.911]  So the unions and the Democratic Party have in place this great game, which holds hostage government employees.
[01:27:18.664 --> 01:27:23.325]  Now, you can't be part of the government employee racket unless you belong to the union racket.
[01:27:24.026 --> 01:27:28.507]  They're all confiscating the money through union dues, funding Democratic Party.
[01:27:28.987 --> 01:27:30.227]  This is a mafia game.
[01:27:30.267 --> 01:27:35.349]  If we're done in business, all these people would be put in jail for organizing a RICO racket.
[01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.489]  And they're extorting the taxpayers.
[01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:39.490]  That's right, and then they come back around.
[01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:49.253]  And Michael Moore was completely... I mean, if anybody has any doubt that this is headed towards socialism or outright communism, Michael Moore basically said, your money is mine.
[01:27:49.273 --> 01:27:53.334]  He said, you know, all the money in the world belongs to the state.
[01:27:53.394 --> 01:27:56.595]  The state can confiscate it and take it and give it to the people.
[01:27:57.135 --> 01:28:00.556]  Well, if that idea ever worked in history, it'd be worth listening to.
[01:28:01.212 --> 01:28:14.791]  But all it is, is the idea that, you know, the thugs like Michael Moore and the others who organized the unions or rabble-roused to get the proletariat raised up, you know, there was never a poor communist at the top.
[01:28:15.740 --> 01:28:19.521]  They always stole the money, make sure they got their share, just like the union bosses.
[01:28:19.601 --> 01:28:21.081]  Find me a poor union boss.
[01:28:21.121 --> 01:28:34.864]  But now they're trying to juxtapose themselves against the banksters, but the big banksters, they're the ones that created the big government to control things, and then you've got Obama sending his thugs in to protest against Bank of America when he's financed by them.
[01:28:34.904 --> 01:28:35.864]  It's totally staged.
[01:28:35.944 --> 01:28:38.585]  Well, it's all staged, because if you take a look at the
[01:28:39.582 --> 01:28:51.930]  The money that goes in from Wall Street, this is another one of the, you know, Michael Moore ought to go to the Federal Election Commission and read the reports, because Wall Street largely funded Barack Obama.
[01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:58.594]  And anybody who has any mystery about that ought to realize that when it came time, Barack Obama paid back.
[01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:01.836]  He bailed out all of his buddies, especially Goldman Sachs.
[01:29:02.477 --> 01:29:03.818]  This is a big game on.
[01:29:04.398 --> 01:29:05.479]  Goldman Sachs has made
[01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:06.781]  He's saying?
[01:29:26.804 --> 01:29:30.065]  It's a game that's to the detriment of the American people and the American economy.
[01:29:30.605 --> 01:29:34.026]  And the globalists and the people at the top want to manage this big money game.
[01:29:34.466 --> 01:29:38.648]  So Wall Street funds Barack Obama and wink wink, they deny it.
[01:29:39.808 --> 01:29:40.248]  Amazing.
[01:29:40.288 --> 01:29:40.628]  Stay there.
[01:29:40.648 --> 01:29:42.509]  Let's come back and finish up on that, Dr. Corsi.
[01:29:42.829 --> 01:29:46.290]  Then I want to get into the big North American Union news while we got you here.
[01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:46.830]  Stay with us.
[01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:48.011]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:49.111]  This is WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:53.976]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.898 --> 01:29:57.583]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.595 --> 01:30:04.817]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.137 --> 01:30:05.738]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.058 --> 01:30:09.200]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.040]  Number 2.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:14.883]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.223 --> 01:30:15.663]  It's true.
[01:30:15.963 --> 01:30:20.526]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:20.846 --> 01:30:21.386]  Number 3.
[01:30:21.666 --> 01:30:24.948]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.248 --> 01:30:28.950]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.150 --> 01:30:29.711]  Number 4.
[01:30:29.951 --> 01:30:32.313]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.714 --> 01:30:36.097]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:36.618]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.178 --> 01:30:41.103]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:41.343 --> 01:30:46.088]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:52.592 --> 01:31:53.092]  Thank you!
[01:32:01.357 --> 01:32:04.981]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:32:05.381 --> 01:32:08.384]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:32:08.624 --> 01:32:13.408]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:32:13.428 --> 01:32:19.634]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:32:19.794 --> 01:32:22.057]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:32:22.577 --> 01:32:23.998]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:32:24.058 --> 01:32:24.839]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:32:25.179 --> 01:32:27.601]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:32:41.471 --> 01:32:45.396]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[01:32:45.856 --> 01:32:48.359]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:57.890]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:33:09.047 --> 01:33:15.392]  All the leaves are brown And the sky is grey
[01:33:38.075 --> 01:33:40.676]  Okay, we are back live with Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[01:33:40.696 --> 01:33:44.037]  What's happening is we're going into an engineered plan economy.
[01:33:44.618 --> 01:33:47.939]  It's a global corporate government, but it's not free market.
[01:33:48.459 --> 01:33:52.821]  So Republicans are taught if it's free market, if it's a corporation, it can do no wrong.
[01:33:53.441 --> 01:34:00.644]  But the corporations are acting like governments, coming in and taking over our governments, lobbying to have our farms and ranches shut down.
[01:34:00.944 --> 01:34:02.725]  So big agribusiness has a monopoly.
[01:34:03.365 --> 01:34:08.828]  Passing environmental laws to shut down small industries so it can only operate in China, India, and Mexico.
[01:34:10.448 --> 01:34:17.371]  Operating so only General Electric gets the waivers for new coal-powered plants, openly to shut down the competition.
[01:34:17.411 --> 01:34:18.672]  That's the Enron plan.
[01:34:19.052 --> 01:34:23.554]  There's been more indictments over the pump-and-dump stuff with the plants.
[01:34:23.614 --> 01:34:25.075]  I mean, this is not our opinion.
[01:34:26.147 --> 01:34:36.250]  And when you read the SPP documents that Judicial Watch got, that Dr. Corsi went through in 2007, and other documents since, they said, look, we've got to integrate by stealth.
[01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:41.272]  It's covered in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, covered in his book, The Late Great USA.
[01:34:42.413 --> 01:34:49.295]  They said, and it was over 100 corporate CEOs, they're giving orders to the heads of the unelected bureaucracy.
[01:34:50.447 --> 01:34:52.650]  And they said, we'll use the flu as a way to integrate.
[01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:53.712]  We'll use terror threat.
[01:34:54.052 --> 01:34:55.134]  We'll use drug threat.
[01:34:55.334 --> 01:34:56.756]  We'll use economic collapse.
[01:34:57.257 --> 01:35:00.421]  And now, they never stopped building it in stealth.
[01:35:00.521 --> 01:35:05.288]  Now Obama has come out and signed the North American Union Security Perimeter.
[01:35:05.308 --> 01:35:06.149]  Dr. Corsi...
[01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:19.337]  Uh, has, uh, written at length about this, and it's all part of the strategic corporate hijacking of the big mega-corporations that are bigger than most governments who have disdain for the free market.
[01:35:20.218 --> 01:35:23.119]  As John D. Rockefeller said, competition is a sin.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:30.604]  Competition is a sin, because he liked inside operations.
[01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:33.407]  Dr. Corsi, you've got the floor on this situation.
[01:35:33.447 --> 01:35:39.351]  We're still going into North American integration by stealth, and it looks like they've put the afterburners back on.
[01:35:39.772 --> 01:35:40.352]  Well, they have.
[01:35:40.412 --> 01:35:42.854]  I mean, I wrote an article in WND.
[01:35:43.775 --> 01:35:48.699]  People aren't aware that Barack Obama met with Prime Minister Stephen Harper.
[01:35:49.686 --> 01:35:55.369]  They agreed on February 4th, they signed a beyond the border bilateral declaration.
[01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:59.010]  It created a North American continental perimeter.
[01:35:59.611 --> 01:36:05.053]  This was one of the chief goals of the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America.
[01:36:05.873 --> 01:36:10.976]  And then, I also wrote my Red Alert newsletter and people now can get the Red Alert newsletter free.
[01:36:11.907 --> 01:36:14.649]  I'm a managing director at Guilford Securities in New York.
[01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:18.211]  I'm still very actively involved in the securities industry.
[01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:19.872]  GuilfordSecurities.com.
[01:36:19.892 --> 01:36:21.633]  You can get Red Alert.
[01:36:21.753 --> 01:36:24.595]  I write it every week free or through WND.
[01:36:25.055 --> 01:36:40.605]  The article I'm headlining this week is that Obama has already decided, it was announced at his press conference last week with Mexico's President Felipe Calderon, to allow the Mexican trucks to come back into the United States, to roll freely throughout the United States.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:44.242]  Congress took the money away from this.
[01:36:44.322 --> 01:36:55.490]  In fact, Obama signed the executive order, signed the law, the defunding, it was in the $410 billion omnibus funding bill that President Obama signed in March 2009.
[01:36:56.011 --> 01:37:08.400]  Congress took away the money from the Department of Transportation to do this Mexican truck demonstration project, but Obama is allowing the Mexican trucks to come back into the United States under his own authority, without any
[01:37:09.517 --> 01:37:13.380]  attempt at all to come to Congress to get authorization or seek approval.
[01:37:15.522 --> 01:37:15.882]  Wow!
[01:37:17.063 --> 01:37:17.844]  Please continue.
[01:37:18.204 --> 01:37:32.175]  I've really tried to detail how what's going on now is a closer merging together with Canada on this continental perimeter deal and then building the infrastructure to integrate with Mexico.
[01:37:32.896 --> 01:37:35.218]  Now another thing most people don't realize is that
[01:37:35.945 --> 01:37:45.414]  Janet Napolitano went down to Mexico on November 30th, the end of last year, and she signed an agreement on trusted travelers.
[01:37:45.474 --> 01:37:49.037]  The North American Trusted Traveler Program was put into place with Mexico.
[01:37:49.838 --> 01:37:58.666]  And what this does is, it allows Mexicans to come and get a card that looks like just an ATM card, or driver's license with your picture on it.
[01:37:58.686 --> 01:38:02.089]  It'll be a biometric card issued by the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:38:02.739 --> 01:38:03.339]  We're good to go.
[01:38:21.952 --> 01:38:23.172]  Terminals being put in place.
[01:38:23.192 --> 01:38:24.753]  They look like ATM machines.
[01:38:24.793 --> 01:38:34.515]  You take your Mexican trusted traveler North American card, you sweep it through the globalentry.gov terminal, you answer a few questions, and you walk in across the border.
[01:38:35.296 --> 01:38:48.039]  And Mexico has just demanded they put into place a program where all children in the schools under age 19, which is probably going to be about 25 million children in Mexico,
[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:55.148]  Are gonna be issued, they have to go get, these biometric government issued ID cards.
[01:38:55.788 --> 01:39:05.380]  They have a picture, have a facial scan with full facial digital recognition, iris recognition built into the card, all 10 fingerprints.
[01:39:06.559 --> 01:39:13.841]  And this is the beginning of, you know, once the Mexican children get these IDs from the Mexican government, then they become trusted travelers in North America.
[01:39:14.302 --> 01:39:18.063]  This is another key program of the Security and Prosperity Partnership in North America.
[01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:21.444]  I've been writing about it on WND and my Red Alert newsletter.
[01:39:21.944 --> 01:39:27.026]  Hardly anybody knows it's being put into place because Barack Obama's decided to go under the radar.
[01:39:27.686 --> 01:39:35.809]  He's taken down the website, SPP.gov, but without announcing these big decisions in any major way,
[01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:50.545]  Through the authority of the White House alone, Barack Obama is letting the Mexican trucks come into the United States, declaring a North American security border with Canada, and beginning the Trusted Traveler of North American program with Mexico.
[01:39:55.069 --> 01:40:08.005]  They just continue to move ahead with this takeover, and I have a news article here in my stack, and I've seen similar ones over the years, over and over again in the Associated Press, you name it.
[01:40:08.586 --> 01:40:09.387]  Canada-U.S.
[01:40:09.447 --> 01:40:12.130]  agree to use each other's troops in civil emergencies.
[01:40:12.691 --> 01:40:13.552]  Canada and the U.S.
[01:40:13.592 --> 01:40:26.479]  have signed an agreement that paves the way for the militaries from either nation to send troops across each other's borders during an emergency, but some are questioning why the government has kept silent on the deal.
[01:40:27.140 --> 01:40:36.586]  But then you bring up NLE-09 and open drills to use foreign troops to, quote, fight American terrorists, and Mexican troops going to New Orleans during Katrina.
[01:40:37.546 --> 01:40:39.127]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[01:40:39.207 --> 01:40:46.969]  The role players at drill after drill with marines and army with foreign troops is American gun owners and libertarians.
[01:40:47.009 --> 01:40:53.331]  So there is a giant program going on preparing for war
[01:40:54.251 --> 01:40:55.852]  Uh, with the American people.
[01:40:55.912 --> 01:41:07.498]  And we need to stop denying that the bureaucracy's out of control, that this is high treason, that Bush committed an act of treason, signing the SPP in secret in 2005 in Waco, as you know, Dr. Corsi.
[01:41:09.935 --> 01:41:12.356]  And there's ongoing continuity of agenda.
[01:41:12.376 --> 01:41:13.497]  There's really no difference.
[01:41:14.057 --> 01:41:15.938]  And I mean, how do we stop this?
[01:41:15.978 --> 01:41:19.640]  I mean, now our troops are at their Olympics.
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:21.641]  Their troops are down here.
[01:41:21.881 --> 01:41:36.248]  Look, Alex, we've signed an agreement under the Security and Prosperity Partnership with Mexico and Canada that if there is another breakout of influenza or avian flu or another health epidemic, the United States has agreed to go under U.N.
[01:41:36.308 --> 01:41:39.410]  authority and to work with a North American command
[01:41:40.174 --> 01:41:42.896]  To deal with the health emergency in the United States.
[01:41:43.756 --> 01:41:45.017]  We've already signed the agreement.
[01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:53.782]  And again, Bush signed the agreement as a... One of these agreements with Mexico and Canada was never brought before Congress as a treaty.
[01:41:54.563 --> 01:41:57.304]  This is all being done under the radar.
[01:41:58.085 --> 01:42:03.208]  And when people like you or I... I mean, I'm going... I'm saying, here's the government websites.
[01:42:03.288 --> 01:42:04.769]  Go to globalentry.gov.
[01:42:06.090 --> 01:42:12.334]  I list the 20 airports where these terminals are being put into place, the Trusted Traveler terminals.
[01:42:12.414 --> 01:42:17.818]  Boston, Logan, Dallas, Houston, Honolulu, JFK in New York.
[01:42:18.399 --> 01:42:20.940]  These are the major airports all around the country.
[01:42:21.461 --> 01:42:22.481]  The terminals are there.
[01:42:23.002 --> 01:42:26.284]  Globalentry.gov, government websites show that they're there.
[01:42:26.704 --> 01:42:31.788]  We point out government websites and they still say we're the conspiracy theorists because
[01:42:32.648 --> 01:42:38.938]  The Obama administration, just like the Bush administration, does not want their globalist North American Union agenda exposed.
[01:42:39.838 --> 01:42:54.329]  And when we do expose it, Alex, they hit back by trying to do ad hominem attacks, calling us names, when the truth is that the real conspirators are the Bush administration, the Obama administration, Canada's government, Mexico's government.
[01:42:54.770 --> 01:43:02.536]  They're all working together to put in place the infrastructure of the North American Union without officially announcing it to the peoples of any of the three countries.
[01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:33.812]  Now, how do we get the word out to people, though, that the same multinational corporations, Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, and others, Cisco, you name it, have openly helped China and India roll out their RFID, National Slave ID cards, that they're helping set that up here, that the Hemispheric ID card, out for three years, is the North American real ID, that the TSA is the federal
[01:43:34.864 --> 01:43:35.184]  I mean...
[01:43:54.879 --> 01:44:20.085]  It's a brazen, full-out offensive against every form of liberty, and that's the one angle that they've got up on us, it seems, is that it's so crazy that even when it's in the news that they're training to bring in Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, deal with American terrorists, that's an Associated Press quote, that it's so crazy people can't...
[01:44:21.894 --> 01:44:23.355]  Can't even deal with it.
[01:44:24.375 --> 01:44:35.780]  I mean, it's almost like the reports of 500 years ago in 1492, when the islanders, the natives in the Americas, would see sailing ships.
[01:44:36.340 --> 01:44:39.821]  They'd never seen anything like it, so some of them couldn't even see it.
[01:44:40.221 --> 01:44:46.904]  Even though it was right there, they couldn't see it because they had no psychological lexicon.
[01:44:46.944 --> 01:44:48.065]  Do you see what I'm saying, Dr. Corsi?
[01:44:48.145 --> 01:44:48.365]  I do.
[01:44:48.965 --> 01:44:56.595]  My approach has always been, Alex, when I'm reporting in WND and my books, I'll have another book out here soon that's going to be another big fight.
[01:44:57.576 --> 01:45:07.269]  I try to tell people, like with the Mexican truck, I've been writing about this for years and saying, both the Bush administration and the Obama administration, they're going to let
[01:45:07.978 --> 01:45:08.739]  We're good to go.
[01:45:25.948 --> 01:45:27.449]  Obama doesn't care about the Teamsters.
[01:45:27.469 --> 01:45:29.390]  It's a globalist agenda.
[01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:40.976]  So now when the Mexican drugs do start rolling in the United States, I expect people to go back to the articles I wrote to see that this was what I was writing about, that I was predicting it and documenting it.
[01:45:41.776 --> 01:45:45.318]  Also, Alex, I'd like to think everything I write is well documented.
[01:45:45.378 --> 01:45:46.959]  I've got links in my articles.
[01:45:47.519 --> 01:45:49.400]  You can see the government websites.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.681]  I'm interviewing the government authorities.
[01:45:51.741 --> 01:45:53.062]  I'm quoting them directly.
[01:45:54.703 --> 01:46:04.505]  Now, when you read one of my pieces, you yourself can go see the primary documents where the government indicates that, yes, the Mexican trucks are now going to come into the United States.
[01:46:04.986 --> 01:46:06.266]  Obama did do this.
[01:46:06.326 --> 01:46:07.606]  He's ignoring Congress.
[01:46:08.106 --> 01:46:10.747]  There's no Congressional vote going to be held on this.
[01:46:11.427 --> 01:46:14.988]  Congress took away the money at the end of the Bush administration.
[01:46:15.008 --> 01:46:16.388]  Obama's not going to care.
[01:46:17.008 --> 01:46:20.009]  He's just going to say, we're going to do the Mexican trucks and let somebody stop
[01:46:20.402 --> 01:46:25.306]  But when you call, Dr. Corsi, when you call this government, it's not even government now.
[01:46:25.326 --> 01:46:27.709]  You don't care about the Constitution anymore, Alex.
[01:46:27.849 --> 01:46:28.669]  It's not government.
[01:46:28.709 --> 01:46:29.730]  It's not even legitimate.
[01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:33.814]  I mean, take the case that came out three weeks ago that we've really dropped the ball on.
[01:46:33.834 --> 01:46:34.695]  We've covered it some.
[01:46:34.715 --> 01:46:38.238]  We have a new article by JT Coyote today on InfoWars.com.
[01:46:38.598 --> 01:46:42.021]  BATFE, secret op creates terror in Mexican border towns.
[01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:44.063]  I knew this several years ago.
[01:46:44.163 --> 01:46:45.865]  Five years ago, I had Stella Costello.
[01:46:46.365 --> 01:46:48.046]  It was a former top DEA agent.
[01:46:48.066 --> 01:46:52.068]  They actually sat him up over this and sent him to prison for coming on this show and others.
[01:46:52.529 --> 01:46:55.270]  And he said they're training Mexican drug cartels in South Texas.
[01:46:55.290 --> 01:46:57.271]  They're going to go after the cartels they don't control.
[01:46:57.672 --> 01:46:59.373]  The Mexican military is the main dealer.
[01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:01.134]  The CIA is training them.
[01:47:02.014 --> 01:47:07.579]  It's gonna start, it's gonna be a war down there, and the government's shipping arms into Mexico to destabilize it.
[01:47:07.940 --> 01:47:21.973]  Now you have top ATF agents coming out valiantly in CBS News and saying, yes, we're ordered to let fully, you know, auto weapons, .50 cal Barrett's, everything... Ordered in quantity.
[01:47:22.413 --> 01:47:45.517]  In quantity, to Mexico, because they know that over 90% of the weapons were being bought from the Germans, sold to the military, I know I'm interrupting, I just want to state it, sold to the military, so the military's selling to the cartels, hardly any of it's from America, so the ATF sets up dealers and conduits to sell guns so they can trace them back to then try to take our guns.
[01:47:45.657 --> 01:47:46.617]  Take away the Second Amendment.
[01:47:46.697 --> 01:47:51.218]  I mean, this is, Dr. Corsi, is this not a false flag that we've caught Obama?
[01:47:51.798 --> 01:47:52.118]  It is.
[01:47:52.198 --> 01:48:01.480]  This whole idea of the ATF allowing guns to be sold to Mexico and then putting out reports that the guns are being smuggled into Mexico so as to limit the Second Amendment.
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.341]  This is a total government operation to destroy the Second Amendment.
[01:48:05.361 --> 01:48:07.561]  It's a false flag.
[01:48:07.902 --> 01:48:12.222]  But look, my new book coming out, Alex is going to be, where's the birth certificate?
[01:48:13.323 --> 01:48:14.803]  It's on the birth certificate.
[01:48:14.823 --> 01:48:17.124]  By the way, I want to carry that book.
[01:48:17.144 --> 01:48:18.744]  Who do I call to carry those in bulk?
[01:48:19.921 --> 01:48:23.403]  Well, I'm not going to carry it unless I can carry it out of the gates, though.
[01:48:23.423 --> 01:48:24.023]  How do I do that?
[01:48:24.043 --> 01:48:28.886]  But again, the fact that they know there's questions about his providence and where he came from, that's all part of this precedent.
[01:48:46.268 --> 01:48:50.110]  The White House doesn't regard, the Obama Administration doesn't care about the Constitution.
[01:48:50.830 --> 01:49:01.814]  In this NPR interview that was done by, you know, this James O'Neill... It shows they're like childlike cults, where they just sit around making fun of people.
[01:49:01.854 --> 01:49:15.260]  The NPR admits they're not going to cover the birther story, even though NPR is sitting at that table saying, we know that there's validity here, we know Barack Obama cannot prove that he is a natural born citizen of the United States.
[01:49:16.502 --> 01:49:17.002]  They know it.
[01:49:17.382 --> 01:49:18.302]  They just won't cover it.
[01:49:18.402 --> 01:49:20.663]  And here they are, secretly taped, admitting it.
[01:49:20.983 --> 01:49:21.483]  Admitting it.
[01:49:22.083 --> 01:49:23.483]  It's the same thing with the guns.
[01:49:24.164 --> 01:49:28.304]  You know, that's why I think my book is already going to be a bestseller for the pre-publication sales.
[01:49:28.324 --> 01:49:29.745]  Take a look at Amazon.com.
[01:49:30.305 --> 01:49:31.985]  Take a look on Barnes & Noble.
[01:49:32.005 --> 01:49:33.926]  We'll get it up on your site right away.
[01:49:33.966 --> 01:49:34.886]  I'll work with your producers.
[01:49:35.066 --> 01:49:38.286]  Yeah, it needs to be up next week if it's already in pre-sale because I want to get it out.
[01:49:38.306 --> 01:49:45.448]  But just in closing, Dr. Corsi, going back to this gun issue, shouldn't we start a movement to call for impeachment of Obama?
[01:49:45.508 --> 01:49:46.088]  Absolutely.
[01:49:46.926 --> 01:49:49.888]  Because this is total disregard for the Constitution.
[01:49:50.068 --> 01:49:55.952]  The government is selling the guns to the cartels to then blame it on America and the Second Amendment.
[01:49:56.192 --> 01:49:57.573]  That's stage terror.
[01:49:57.693 --> 01:50:05.998]  And coming out with reports saying these guns are being smuggled into Mexico, therefore we need to have gun control in the United States.
[01:50:06.198 --> 01:50:06.638]  Terrorism.
[01:50:08.413 --> 01:50:15.177]  I mean, how many times, doctor, do we have to catch them creating the crisis to realize this is a group of ruthless crooks?
[01:50:15.218 --> 01:50:18.880]  And if they're going to commit 100 crimes, why not commit 10,000 or 10 million?
[01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:23.803]  Well, let's go interview the Teamsters Union and see how they feel having supported Barack Obama.
[01:50:24.324 --> 01:50:26.985]  Now Barack Obama's letting the Mexican trucks in the United States.
[01:50:27.025 --> 01:50:35.231]  Barack Obama does not care that, you know, about 93% of all motor carriers in the United States have fewer than 20 trucks in their fleet.
[01:50:35.931 --> 01:50:37.112]  Which are U.S.
[01:50:37.132 --> 01:50:41.713]  companies, big companies, that are going down to Mexico and operating as Mexican trucking companies?
[01:50:41.733 --> 01:50:42.293]  Oh, it's over.
[01:50:42.433 --> 01:50:45.875]  It's part of the race to the bottom, and it won't help Mexico either.
[01:50:46.475 --> 01:50:48.396]  Dr. Corsi, always great having you on.
[01:50:48.436 --> 01:50:50.536]  Let's have you on next week or two weeks from now.
[01:50:51.197 --> 01:50:52.577]  I want to get that book and carry it.
[01:50:52.897 --> 01:50:53.918]  Where's the birth certificate?
[01:50:53.938 --> 01:50:54.798]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:50:54.818 --> 01:50:55.798]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:50:55.878 --> 01:50:56.238]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:50:56.278 --> 01:50:57.239]  I look forward to it.
[01:50:57.319 --> 01:50:57.599]  You bet.
[01:50:57.639 --> 01:50:58.219]  Take care, buddy.
[01:50:58.239 --> 01:50:58.859]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:58.899 --> 01:50:59.840]  More news straight ahead.
[01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:00.420]  Lindsey Williams.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:02.801]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[01:51:03.041 --> 01:51:08.162]  I have, and all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars.
[01:51:08.342 --> 01:51:12.423]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[01:51:12.683 --> 01:51:18.145]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:21.106]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[01:51:21.586 --> 01:51:29.548]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds.
[01:51:29.548 --> 01:51:30.749]  We're good to go.
[01:51:50.061 --> 01:51:50.901]  Real happy.
[01:51:51.302 --> 01:51:57.004]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[01:51:57.064 --> 01:52:00.245]  That's OneWorld, W-H-E-Y.com.
[01:52:00.825 --> 01:52:02.065]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.125 --> 01:52:07.467]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.707 --> 01:52:09.308]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:52:09.548 --> 01:52:12.330]  Non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold.
[01:52:12.730 --> 01:52:13.111]  It's true.
[01:52:13.191 --> 01:52:15.773]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:16.013 --> 01:52:17.794]  And it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.294 --> 01:52:22.998]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.518 --> 01:52:25.460]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:30.443]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:31.504]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.744 --> 01:52:34.506]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.526 --> 01:52:38.109]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.430 --> 01:52:41.272]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.632 --> 01:52:43.514]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:44.935 --> 01:52:47.918]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.418 --> 01:52:50.160]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:07.308 --> 01:54:09.953]  Alright, we got Lindsey Williams coming right up at the start of the hour.
[01:54:09.973 --> 01:54:11.456]  We're gonna have open phones for him.
[01:54:18.444 --> 01:54:33.394]  I want to finish up with some statements on the unions and some other important news, but we told you there was going to be global food riots a decade ago, when dollar devaluation happened, when they prepared to implode that global currency and bring in the new cashless system.
[01:54:33.694 --> 01:54:38.637]  You'll still have paper money, it'll just be digitally controlled at the IMF World Bank level.
[01:54:38.778 --> 01:54:39.878]  Now that's all public.
[01:54:40.179 --> 01:54:40.919]  How did we know?
[01:54:40.939 --> 01:54:45.082]  We have the Trilateral Commission and UN and IMF World Bank public reports.
[01:54:45.842 --> 01:54:47.603]  They trust that you don't read this stuff.
[01:54:47.684 --> 01:54:48.124]  We did.
[01:54:49.244 --> 01:54:50.065]  It's all public.
[01:54:50.105 --> 01:54:51.286]  That's what's so frustrating.
[01:54:51.986 --> 01:54:54.107]  The foreign troops to take our guns.
[01:54:54.668 --> 01:54:56.069]  It's in the newspaper.
[01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:57.429]  It doesn't exist.
[01:54:57.489 --> 01:54:57.950]  I'm a cook.
[01:54:59.531 --> 01:55:01.272]  Taking the veterans' death benefits.
[01:55:01.592 --> 01:55:02.612]  It's in Bloomberg.
[01:55:03.013 --> 01:55:04.453]  The vets are having their money taken.
[01:55:04.473 --> 01:55:09.496]  And when they go to their local group asking for help, they say, it's unpatriotic to ask for your death benefits.
[01:55:09.817 --> 01:55:10.497]  Get out of here.
[01:55:10.517 --> 01:55:12.118]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:55:12.638 --> 01:55:15.200]  It's just all this shallow mindlessness.
[01:55:19.667 --> 01:55:21.068]  What did I tell you in the last two years?
[01:55:21.088 --> 01:55:27.694]  That they were going to implode the world economy, implode the Middle East, and then blame it on the Arabs and oil.
[01:55:27.974 --> 01:55:29.275]  And now they're all over the news.
[01:55:29.755 --> 01:55:32.217]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, The Economist.
[01:55:32.598 --> 01:55:38.242]  Just as the world was recovering, oil as a time bomb with the fuse burning.
[01:55:38.343 --> 01:55:39.964]  I mean, it's just everywhere.
[01:55:40.364 --> 01:55:42.166]  It's all scripted.
[01:55:44.670 --> 01:55:49.874]  I mean, do we even tell you exactly what they're going to do with exact numbers?
[01:55:51.875 --> 01:55:53.476]  And then people try to sit there and nitpick.
[01:55:54.897 --> 01:55:56.258]  We know what we're talking about.
[01:55:56.298 --> 01:55:57.819]  The global government's out in the open.
[01:55:57.859 --> 01:55:58.319]  It's real.
[01:56:00.481 --> 01:56:03.763]  They've gone from laughing at us about chemtrails to admitting it but saying it's good.
[01:56:03.983 --> 01:56:08.246]  They've gone from laughing at us saying they're putting lithium and things in the water to saying, yeah, we're doing it.
[01:56:08.266 --> 01:56:09.287]  It's for your own good.
[01:56:11.476 --> 01:56:15.397]  Do you realize all over the country they add uranium and other isotopes to the water?
[01:56:15.717 --> 01:56:18.258]  And it's even in the mainstream news and nobody gets in trouble.
[01:56:18.538 --> 01:56:19.918]  Yeah, we're adding uranium!
[01:56:20.098 --> 01:56:20.719]  Die!
[01:56:21.579 --> 01:56:22.739]  The public's like, you bet!
[01:56:23.139 --> 01:56:23.859]  Give me some more!
[01:56:23.879 --> 01:56:30.161]  I ain't gonna listen to that conspiracy theorist tell me uranium ain't no good!
[01:56:31.581 --> 01:56:33.202]  I like my uraniumums!
[01:56:35.643 --> 01:56:40.444]  And then you got all these union people financed by the Democrats
[01:56:41.704 --> 01:56:50.869]  One arm of the New World Order, running in and demanding higher taxes and eluding the middle class, when that's what the IMF and World Bank and Federal Reserve have called for, because they get the money.
[01:56:51.269 --> 01:56:53.670]  You don't have a real lobby, dum-dums.
[01:56:54.130 --> 01:56:55.111]  You're not going to get it.
[01:56:55.451 --> 01:57:02.595]  Even if you were average thieves who wanted to take what's left of the middle class's money, for all your government largesse, do you understand we're bankrupt?
[01:57:03.955 --> 01:57:06.697]  And I've said, cutting your goodies isn't going to fix anything.
[01:57:07.357 --> 01:57:09.618]  You've got to write off that 1.5 quadrillion.
[01:57:09.978 --> 01:57:10.438]  I mean, if
[01:57:13.243 --> 01:57:16.004]  Michael Moore came out and said arrest the head of Goldman Sachs, J.P.
[01:57:16.024 --> 01:57:21.747]  Morgan, right off the 1.5 quadrillion, abolish the Federal Reserve, I would fall down on my knees and lick his boots.
[01:57:23.448 --> 01:57:27.510]  I don't enjoy up here bashing him, but he has to be bashed.
[01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:32.812]  He's up there posing as a populist saying, the money is a collective resource.
[01:57:33.853 --> 01:57:38.575]  Did people in Communist China or Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany get part of the collective resource?
[01:57:39.055 --> 01:57:40.356]  No, you don't get it.
[01:57:41.156 --> 01:57:42.277]  You don't get a free lunch.
[01:57:43.959 --> 01:57:46.321]  And the end of the free ride is coming to an end, folks.
[01:57:46.421 --> 01:57:46.682]  Okay?
[01:57:47.402 --> 01:57:49.704]  So, we're almost out of time for this hour.
[01:57:49.765 --> 01:57:54.069]  I hope folks will visit Infowars.com and buy some of the books, the videos, the materials.
[01:57:54.369 --> 01:57:55.330]  We're not like the government.
[01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:58.252]  We don't come with a gun and take your money and then use it against you.
[01:57:58.273 --> 01:58:04.819]  We ask for you to support us by getting the new book, Big Brother.
[01:58:06.872 --> 01:58:11.234]  Mark Dice's new book, exclusively available at InfoWars.com, The Orwellian Nightmare Come True.
[01:58:11.674 --> 01:58:12.434]  Excellent new book.
[01:58:12.994 --> 01:58:17.416]  You can get these very handsome, you are the resistance, InfoWars.com bumper stickers.
[01:58:18.316 --> 01:58:20.217]  All the orders, get a free Citizen Rule book.
[01:58:21.157 --> 01:58:24.278]  Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception, Invisible Empire Endgame.
[01:58:25.879 --> 01:58:27.960]  You may know all about this stuff.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:31.341]  You may be 100% aware of all this information.
[01:58:32.759 --> 01:58:35.161]  But I assure you, your friends and family aren't.
[01:58:35.581 --> 01:58:36.902]  Now is the time to wake them up.
[01:58:36.942 --> 01:58:39.543]  Get the books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:42.245 --> 01:58:44.086]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.767 --> 01:58:47.568]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.989 --> 01:58:58.674]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[01:58:59.034 --> 01:59:01.255]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[01:59:01.696 --> 01:59:07.059]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February.
[01:59:07.359 --> 01:59:10.501]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[01:59:10.742 --> 01:59:18.647]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[01:59:18.987 --> 01:59:20.828]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[01:59:22.029 --> 01:59:22.369]  I think so.
[01:59:53.607 --> 01:59:55.508]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.988 --> 01:59:58.829]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.351 --> 02:00:06.011]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.672 --> 02:00:07.732]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.432 --> 02:00:09.573]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.193 --> 02:00:11.013]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.773 --> 02:00:12.754]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.314 --> 02:00:16.975]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.515 --> 02:00:21.617]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.112 --> 02:00:27.053]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:27.093 --> 02:00:29.294]  Thank you into the third hour for the full hour.
[02:00:29.674 --> 02:00:31.675]  Pastor Chaplain Lindsey Williams joins us.
[02:00:31.695 --> 02:00:48.844]  Then I'm going into overdrive with Aaron Dice with a detailed 20-30 minute report on the takeover of the energy infrastructure, the power plants in the U.S., and how it's hidden in plain view, run by Enron-type people, set up by them, George Soros, how the scam works.
[02:00:48.884 --> 02:00:50.505]  This is so important to our future.
[02:00:50.905 --> 02:00:54.169]  A lot of folks just flipped the light switch on but wonder why their power bill's going up.
[02:00:54.650 --> 02:00:55.932]  We're going to explain all of that.
[02:00:56.032 --> 02:01:03.562]  But, you know, I had to get Lindsey Williams back on because we finally got up off of our rumpuses and went to the
[02:01:06.258 --> 02:01:24.228]  Audio of the October 21st, 2010, now about five months ago, audio of Pastor Lindsey Williams saying that his now deceased oil company exec connection, who died a few months after that, and his other even bigger connection told him, yes, within six months, $150 to $200 a barrel.
[02:01:27.709 --> 02:01:49.116]  Now we have Bloomberg, London Telegraph and others reporting Saudi Arabia's Day of Rage lures record bets on $200 oil chart and it says that the largest call contract options by New York Crude for June delivery is at $200 a barrel.
[02:01:51.494 --> 02:01:56.396]  And, uh, that is exactly what is, uh, now, uh, beginning to unfold.
[02:01:57.116 --> 02:02:12.042]  And this is what is, and remember, as all company exec sources have been right, and I'm, in the next segment, when everybody joins us, I'm going to go over some of the history of Lindsey's predictions briefly, and then, and then this new revelation of information, uh, where all of this is going.
[02:02:12.383 --> 02:02:15.504]  But the main reason we have Lindsey here today is to take your phone calls.
[02:02:16.264 --> 02:02:18.766]  And, you know, to say, look, see, Lindsey told you so.
[02:02:18.786 --> 02:02:22.990]  I mean, I knew who Ken Fromm was years ago.
[02:02:23.090 --> 02:02:23.830]  Couldn't tell you the name.
[02:02:23.850 --> 02:02:24.391]  He's dead now.
[02:02:24.431 --> 02:02:24.791]  We can.
[02:02:24.811 --> 02:02:26.353]  I know who the other guy is.
[02:02:26.553 --> 02:02:27.514]  Can't tell you who he is.
[02:02:27.554 --> 02:02:28.494]  And he's alive and well.
[02:02:29.535 --> 02:02:32.478]  And what they're telling you is from what the insiders plan to do.
[02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:35.301]  And it's just incredible.
[02:02:35.321 --> 02:02:40.425]  But Lindsey, we're about to go to break and come back to the full audience, but I wish your sources were wrong.
[02:02:40.485 --> 02:02:53.154]  But the key to this all, with him being proven right, shows on top of all the other admissions of George Soros and NSA and CIA and Google and MI6 and SAS running these overthrows.
[02:02:53.334 --> 02:02:54.355]  It's a fact they're doing it.
[02:02:54.715 --> 02:02:56.256]  Doesn't mean these dictators are good.
[02:02:56.736 --> 02:03:00.499]  The point is this is staged, but you said this five months ago on the show.
[02:03:04.179 --> 02:03:04.720]  Turn him on.
[02:03:04.740 --> 02:03:06.101]  We'll go to him.
[02:03:06.161 --> 02:03:07.002]  Lindsey, did we have you there?
[02:03:07.643 --> 02:03:09.305]  Yes, you're exactly right, Alex.
[02:03:09.345 --> 02:03:12.127]  You allowed me the privilege to be on your show.
[02:03:12.688 --> 02:03:15.411]  And I know both of us had our reputations at stake.
[02:03:15.911 --> 02:03:21.377]  And I said that they had told me that within 35 months there would be a conflict in the Middle East.
[02:03:21.797 --> 02:03:22.999]  They did not say Iran.
[02:03:23.639 --> 02:03:24.780]  They did not say Egypt.
[02:03:25.261 --> 02:03:26.462]  I knew it was going to happen.
[02:03:26.822 --> 02:03:30.345]  And then two weeks ago, I found out why it happened.
[02:03:30.845 --> 02:03:37.450]  And today, we know not only what all this is about, but what it's going to be about from this point on, Alex.
[02:03:39.261 --> 02:03:40.082]  Well, it's incredible.
[02:03:40.142 --> 02:03:47.270]  We're going to come back in a moment and basically recap the previous things they told you, just in brevity, as brief as we can.
[02:03:48.051 --> 02:03:50.974]  You know, three and a half years ago, it was $50 a barrel.
[02:03:51.034 --> 02:03:52.316]  They said it would go to $150.
[02:03:52.356 --> 02:03:52.696]  It did.
[02:03:52.716 --> 02:03:54.498]  Then the media said it would go to $200.
[02:03:54.558 --> 02:03:55.259]  You said no.
[02:03:55.619 --> 02:03:56.560]  Now it's going to go down to $40.
[02:03:57.301 --> 02:03:58.281]  Within the next two months.
[02:03:58.321 --> 02:03:59.082]  Did exactly that.
[02:03:59.122 --> 02:04:00.362]  You got laughed at and it happened.
[02:04:01.223 --> 02:04:02.203]  How quickly they forget.
[02:04:02.223 --> 02:04:04.864]  Then you said, now enjoy yourself the next two years.
[02:04:04.925 --> 02:04:07.486]  It'll only grow a little bit to $60 a barrel or so.
[02:04:07.846 --> 02:04:11.768]  But then after that look out, it's going to center in and around a flare up in the Middle East.
[02:04:12.728 --> 02:04:14.609]  And it's going to go up to 150 or more.
[02:04:15.190 --> 02:04:17.631]  Then, five months ago, they tell you, OK, here's the time frame.
[02:04:17.671 --> 02:04:19.512]  Six months from now, this will begin.
[02:04:19.532 --> 02:04:20.893]  $150, $200 a barrel.
[02:04:21.213 --> 02:04:22.254]  Now we see that happening.
[02:04:22.574 --> 02:04:24.175]  I mean, it just goes on and on, Lindsey.
[02:04:24.195 --> 02:04:31.580]  We're going to come back, recap that, go over some of the news headlines, look at what dollar devaluation means, run through one segment with you.
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.020]  Then we're opening the phones up.
[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:35.002]  Specific questions for Lindsey Williams.
[02:04:35.462 --> 02:04:36.783]  We don't screen your phone calls.
[02:04:37.463 --> 02:04:40.606]  But occasionally, maybe once a week, I have a guest on on a certain topic.
[02:04:41.046 --> 02:04:49.253]  If you call in about another website, or the Easter Bunny, or Vatican Assassins, or blood-drinking lizards, I'm not going to take your... I'm going to hang up on you.
[02:04:49.353 --> 02:04:50.233]  I want to hear from you.
[02:04:50.634 --> 02:04:52.435]  I want to see the different directions you take us in.
[02:04:52.715 --> 02:04:55.478]  But I want to hear your questions for Lindsey Williams on what's happening on this front.
[02:04:55.498 --> 02:04:55.838]  800-259-9231.
[02:04:55.858 --> 02:04:56.118]  Stay with us.
[02:05:00.623 --> 02:05:01.764]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:01.804 --> 02:05:08.472]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:05:08.732 --> 02:05:11.015]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:05:11.295 --> 02:05:16.461]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:05:16.661 --> 02:05:19.442]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:05:19.702 --> 02:05:21.803]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:05:22.023 --> 02:05:27.945]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:05:28.265 --> 02:05:31.466]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:05:31.646 --> 02:05:37.168]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:05:37.428 --> 02:05:38.728]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:05:39.068 --> 02:05:40.249]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:05:40.369 --> 02:05:42.909]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:05:43.049 --> 02:05:44.450]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:47.093]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:05:47.253 --> 02:05:51.759]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:05:51.879 --> 02:05:54.342]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:05:57.486 --> 02:05:58.087]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:00.370 --> 02:06:04.331]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:06:04.571 --> 02:06:10.593]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:06:10.973 --> 02:06:18.054]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:06:18.355 --> 02:06:22.936]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:06:23.216 --> 02:06:25.356]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091.
[02:06:28.177 --> 02:06:31.699]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:06:31.919 --> 02:06:34.181]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:06:34.221 --> 02:06:34.541]  Call us.
[02:07:00.998 --> 02:07:15.447]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:07:16.468 --> 02:07:20.170]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:21.170 --> 02:07:33.156]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:07:33.916 --> 02:07:41.200]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[02:07:41.880 --> 02:07:51.488]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[02:07:52.249 --> 02:07:55.512]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[02:07:56.172 --> 02:07:59.375]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[02:08:01.217 --> 02:08:06.762]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:13.277 --> 02:08:24.620]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going live into the fourth hour today in overdrive with a key report on the energy takeover strategy and stratagems being used to destroy our republic and the rest of the planet.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:31.142]  It's all about mafia consolidation by the insider globalist, Aaron Dykes, joining us in studio next hour.
[02:08:31.542 --> 02:08:36.063]  For the rest of this hour, Lindsey Williams, proven right again, is our guest.
[02:08:36.083 --> 02:08:40.625]  But he's here today from the 20 after break to the end of the hour to take your phone calls.
[02:08:40.665 --> 02:08:41.685]  Toll-free number to join us.
[02:08:43.006 --> 02:08:43.466]  800-259-9231.
[02:08:43.867 --> 02:08:47.930]  Now, let's briefly recap.
[02:08:47.990 --> 02:08:52.494]  Three and a half years ago, oil is at about $55-$60 a barrel.
[02:08:53.134 --> 02:08:56.257]  Lindsey Williams says it will go to $150 from his inside.
[02:08:56.317 --> 02:08:59.940]  Two oil company exec connections who are globalists known to us.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:00.621]  Now one of them's dead.
[02:09:00.661 --> 02:09:01.281]  We can talk about him.
[02:09:01.681 --> 02:09:02.282]  Ken Fromm.
[02:09:02.322 --> 02:09:04.404]  Can't talk about Mr. L. Still alive.
[02:09:05.823 --> 02:09:11.868]  Oil then, everybody laughs at Lindsey, it then rockets to 149, then it drops, starts dropping a little.
[02:09:11.888 --> 02:09:14.349]  Before that even happens, Lindsey says it will go down to 40.
[02:09:14.870 --> 02:09:17.271]  It doesn't just go to 40, it goes to 32 for a while.
[02:09:17.792 --> 02:09:19.213]  Then he says, enjoy yourselves.
[02:09:19.593 --> 02:09:23.376]  For two years, my sources say it's going to move up just a little bit to 60 or so.
[02:09:23.896 --> 02:09:26.298]  Then there'll be destabilization in the Middle East.
[02:09:26.478 --> 02:09:28.840]  After two years, it will explode and go to 150 or more.
[02:09:30.481 --> 02:09:50.368]  Then on October 21st, 2010, five months ago on this broadcast, he broke the news that Mr. Fromm, very close to death, and he did die a month and a half later, said that the plan has been initiated for destabilization, not war in the Middle East, destabilization.
[02:09:50.648 --> 02:09:52.849]  That is not countries fighting each other, but civil war.
[02:09:54.049 --> 02:09:56.530]  You can go hear the whole hour interview from that date.
[02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:58.010]  It's up on our YouTube channel.
[02:09:58.030 --> 02:09:59.571]  It's up on presentplanet.tv as well.
[02:10:00.712 --> 02:10:08.075]  And, in fact, it's just Lindsay Williams' predictions on the Alex Jones Show, October 21st, 2010.
[02:10:09.675 --> 02:10:12.096]  And so Williams said, it's going to go up to 150.
[02:10:12.136 --> 02:10:14.157]  Then he said, now it's going to go down to 40.
[02:10:14.537 --> 02:10:15.038]  People laughed.
[02:10:15.058 --> 02:10:15.418]  Went down to 40.
[02:10:16.078 --> 02:10:19.599]  Now it's going to just slowly go up, but not above 60 or so for two years.
[02:10:19.659 --> 02:10:20.360]  Enjoy yourselves.
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:23.081]  Then after that, uh, uh,
[02:10:24.878 --> 02:10:27.321]  In the next six months, it's going to explode in the Middle East.
[02:10:27.461 --> 02:10:27.822]  Boom!
[02:10:28.142 --> 02:10:28.683]  It's happening.
[02:10:28.723 --> 02:10:31.467]  Now, what are the headlines today and yesterday?
[02:10:31.827 --> 02:10:40.218]  Saudi Arabia's Day of Rage lures record bets on $200 oil chart of the day by June delivery.
[02:10:40.879 --> 02:10:45.701]  That would make it six and a half, seven months from Lindsey Williams' report to us.
[02:10:45.882 --> 02:10:47.502]  Right on time for $200 a barrel.
[02:10:48.263 --> 02:10:55.346]  Continuing, oil markets brace for Saudi rage as global spare capacity wears thin.
[02:10:55.787 --> 02:10:56.507]  Talk of $150 to $200 a barrel.
[02:10:56.527 --> 02:10:57.307]  It's already over $8 a gallon in Europe.
[02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:01.229]  Or a leader.
[02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:04.312]  Continuing oil already above 105.
[02:11:04.352 --> 02:11:08.335]  In the next month, the futures are between 114 and 122.
[02:11:09.156 --> 02:11:11.818]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[02:11:12.178 --> 02:11:16.982]  But before we go to Lindsey Williams, I want to play a clip from him here on the show.
[02:11:17.782 --> 02:11:20.164]  And this was on October 21st.
[02:11:25.154 --> 02:11:34.525]  Two thousand and ten on this radio broadcast where Lindsey Williams laid out this information.
[02:11:34.605 --> 02:11:37.568]  They didn't know I was going to it, okay?
[02:11:37.889 --> 02:11:44.597]  Lindsey, tell us about this clip that's coming up here in a minute from you in October, what you were told by Mr. Fromm and others.
[02:11:45.703 --> 02:11:53.945]  I feel so honored that by the providence of God, I would be allowed to know these things in advance so that I could tell the American people what's happening.
[02:11:54.586 --> 02:11:58.787]  And if it had not been for those three years I lived with the elite of the world, I would not know it.
[02:11:59.227 --> 02:12:06.449]  But on this clip, and I said it on your show, and again, Alex, please allow me, I am not a prophet.
[02:12:07.229 --> 02:12:16.391]  I only tell what the elite have told me because of their trust in me 35 years ago when I was their chaplain for three years and lived with them.
[02:12:16.991 --> 02:12:26.773]  And they have said everything is going to take place before it happens because it's part of their moral code that they must tell the world what they're going to do before they do it.
[02:12:27.233 --> 02:12:31.534]  And on your show, you were daring enough to allow me to say some things
[02:12:32.014 --> 02:12:43.166]  That could have ruined either one of our reputations and I said that I had just been told by the elite of the world that within four to five months there would be a conflict in the Middle East.
[02:12:43.686 --> 02:12:48.911]  Now let's go back again because you've reiterated some of these and you were exactly right.
[02:12:49.332 --> 02:12:52.815]  I actually said it only because they had said it to me.
[02:12:53.616 --> 02:13:02.699]  Three years ago they said the price of crude oil is going from $147 a barrel to $50 a barrel, $1.50 a gallon at the gas pump.
[02:13:03.299 --> 02:13:07.040]  And it happened three months after I started on your show exactly.
[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:09.501]  But before that you predicted it would go to $150 and that was right too.
[02:13:11.696 --> 02:13:13.819]  Yes, and then they said it will stay that.
[02:13:14.219 --> 02:13:20.086]  This, Alex, that nobody in the world can doubt this because I said it on your show two and a half years.
[02:13:20.707 --> 02:13:29.057]  I said that they told me it was going to stay between $70 and $80 a barrel, and it did exactly almost to the day.
[02:13:29.617 --> 02:13:36.500]  Then they said it's going to go back up to $150 to $200 a barrel, exactly as I was told.
[02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:37.840]  Folks, are you getting this date?
[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:49.284]  And I recorded it in my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, exactly as I was told in 1947, when I watched the Garland Field brought in.
[02:13:49.304 --> 02:13:49.824]  You mean 1977?
[02:13:52.689 --> 02:13:54.271]  Uh, 1977, I'm sorry.
[02:13:54.831 --> 02:14:04.019]  And they said the price of crude oil, we will get it to where we want it to go before we release any oil from the Atlantic Wildlife Reef.
[02:14:04.079 --> 02:14:05.320]  And now they're going to open that up.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:07.162]  So, so, so this is all coming to pass.
[02:14:07.202 --> 02:14:13.167]  We do have the clip ready from you, October 21st, 2010, five months ago, here on air.
[02:14:13.467 --> 02:14:14.368]  Here's Lindsey Williams.
[02:14:14.608 --> 02:14:16.811]  Let it back up with their crude oil prices.
[02:14:17.232 --> 02:14:20.657]  This means that their program is on schedule.
[02:14:21.037 --> 02:14:25.263]  They're doing exactly what they've been telling me over these years they were going to do.
[02:14:25.283 --> 02:14:25.684]  Here it is.
[02:14:26.457 --> 02:14:27.078]  Here's the price.
[02:14:27.478 --> 02:14:33.463]  Crude oil is going back to $152,200 a barrel.
[02:14:33.623 --> 02:14:40.168]  Gasoline at the gas pump will be $4 to $5 a gallon.
[02:14:40.689 --> 02:14:44.832]  This is going to contrive massive inflation.
[02:14:45.252 --> 02:14:48.155]  Can you imagine what this is going to do to airline fares?
[02:14:48.715 --> 02:14:54.980]  And now the Al Gores and others are positioned to roll out with their solution the quote green economy that they control.
[02:15:16.943 --> 02:15:21.826]  Yes, and every bit of this is part of their total program of what they're going to do.
[02:15:21.926 --> 02:15:31.733]  Now, what Janet Napolitano said only moments ago on national news, on a special bulletin, that they are very concerned about a cyber attack.
[02:15:32.033 --> 02:15:40.119]  Do you realize what this would do to crude oil prices when you went to, for instance, you go to the service station and you can't use your credit card?
[02:15:40.299 --> 02:15:44.483]  Okay folks, so it goes on for an hour, him talking about the Middle East flare-up, all of it.
[02:15:44.523 --> 02:15:47.805]  The date is October 21st of last year.
[02:15:48.366 --> 02:15:52.269]  It's in our archives, the free audio archives, the higherqualityprisonplanet.tv.
[02:15:52.309 --> 02:15:53.590]  It's on the Alex Jones Channel.
[02:15:54.031 --> 02:15:57.694]  It's all over the web, if you want to go hear the hour-long interview, where he lays it all out.
[02:15:57.734 --> 02:15:58.835]  But there it is.
[02:16:00.436 --> 02:16:02.297]  $150, $200, that's what they're telling him.
[02:16:02.637 --> 02:16:04.798]  And then he goes on to say, flare up in the Middle East.
[02:16:05.078 --> 02:16:07.099]  You can hear the whole hour-long program up on the site.
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:08.920]  But there it is, Lindsey.
[02:16:09.301 --> 02:16:12.663]  Now we're seeing it all unfold like clockwork.
[02:16:12.983 --> 02:16:25.670]  Now the headlines are $150 to $200 a barrel because your inside oil company execs are running in the same group as the head of Shell and others, now saying the exact same thing because they're covering a blueprint.
[02:16:26.769 --> 02:16:31.352]  No one could have ever possibly have known this without them telling it to you.
[02:16:31.532 --> 02:16:34.413]  I could not have guessed this even if I had tried.
[02:16:34.433 --> 02:16:45.020]  There's no way that a little insignificant guy sitting down here could possibly have ever conjured all of this up and been right every single time for 35 years.
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:47.061]  Now, this morning in Europe,
[02:16:47.651 --> 02:16:50.192]  Gasoline, right now, while we're speaking on the air.
[02:16:50.852 --> 02:16:58.496]  Gasoline is $8.32 a liter because Libya cut off 1.6 million barrels of oil.
[02:16:58.636 --> 02:17:02.778]  It caused the price of gasoline to go up everywhere across Europe.
[02:17:03.178 --> 02:17:08.002]  Folks, you are going to see the identical same thing happen in the United States of America.
[02:17:08.022 --> 02:17:11.004]  Now remember, that was $8.32 a liter.
[02:17:11.384 --> 02:17:16.468]  In the United States of America, you're going to see $4.05 and maybe even $6 a gallon.
[02:17:16.928 --> 02:17:20.791]  Goldman Sachs won all of their investors on yesterday.
[02:17:21.091 --> 02:17:22.592]  You can go look this up for yourself.
[02:17:23.032 --> 02:17:23.733]  And they said,
[02:17:24.273 --> 02:17:28.717]  There is a Day of Rage scheduled by the Muslim Brotherhood this weekend.
[02:17:29.097 --> 02:17:34.361]  Now I am not saying, I'm saying, I'm Lindsey William, I am not saying it's going to be successful.
[02:17:34.481 --> 02:17:37.984]  It may take a number of tries before they succeed in what they're going to do.
[02:17:38.565 --> 02:17:43.349]  But Goldman Sachs said the Muslim Brotherhood has scheduled a Day of Rage this weekend.
[02:17:43.709 --> 02:17:48.933]  If they succeed, that's exactly what Goldman warned the people who played
[02:17:49.233 --> 02:17:51.316]  Well, that's what she was saying three weeks ago.
[02:17:51.436 --> 02:17:57.703]  Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, three weeks ago you were the first to say, day of rage, this is going to be the trigger.
[02:17:57.864 --> 02:18:01.288]  I've been told Saudi Arabia is going to be cut off as well.
[02:18:01.368 --> 02:18:03.050]  I mean, you've been right on target.
[02:18:03.919 --> 02:18:05.059]  Why the Day of Rage?
[02:18:05.119 --> 02:18:05.940]  How did I know it?
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:07.700]  I knew it because they're doing it.
[02:18:08.161 --> 02:18:18.564]  The elite of the world are financing the Muslim Brotherhood to do what happened in Egypt, what's happened in Libya, what is going to happen in Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:18.584 --> 02:18:31.609]  It's financed by the elite themselves and the Muslim Brotherhood, Day of Rage, and Goldman Sachs says if they succeed this weekend that I'm not saying it's going to happen now.
[02:18:32.029 --> 02:18:34.551]  I was not told by the elite that this will happen.
[02:18:34.591 --> 02:18:46.020]  I'm talking about Goldman Sachs said it to their investors yesterday that if the Muslim Brotherhood succeed this weekend with their day of rage that by Monday morning we could have $200, over $200 of our oil.
[02:18:48.682 --> 02:18:52.384]  You could see gasoline at the gas pump, six to seven dollars a gallon.
[02:18:52.744 --> 02:18:53.824]  Now, I didn't say that.
[02:18:54.124 --> 02:18:55.985]  I did not say the elite told me that.
[02:18:56.205 --> 02:18:57.766]  And don't you dare misquote me.
[02:18:58.086 --> 02:19:01.928]  All of you have misquoted me enough out there on the internet, and I'm getting sick of it.
[02:19:02.248 --> 02:19:04.329]  I want you to quote what these people told me.
[02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:11.732]  They told me... Hold on, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey, Lindsey.
[02:19:13.032 --> 02:19:17.554]  Lindsey, Lindsey, there's no reason to even respond.
[02:19:17.654 --> 02:19:18.955]  It's COINTELPRO.
[02:19:19.515 --> 02:19:23.196]  It's people living in their mother's basements that pick up the COINTELPRO.
[02:19:23.717 --> 02:19:27.118]  You could give them geese that lay golden eggs and they'd slit your throat.
[02:19:27.598 --> 02:19:29.939]  Ignore the COINTELPRO.
[02:19:30.359 --> 02:19:34.181]  Your record of accuracy is there and is strong.
[02:19:35.061 --> 02:19:37.602]  And they're still saying there's no world government.
[02:19:37.982 --> 02:19:40.843]  They're still saying there's no sodium fluoride in the water.
[02:19:41.243 --> 02:19:43.964]  They're still saying there's no dollar devaluation.
[02:19:44.284 --> 02:19:47.606]  They're still saying TSA doesn't put their hands down our pants.
[02:19:48.066 --> 02:19:51.387]  They're still saying that the federal government isn't out of control.
[02:19:51.847 --> 02:19:54.848]  They're still saying all of this, so who cares?
[02:19:55.228 --> 02:19:56.989]  Those that are going to listen are going to listen.
[02:19:57.029 --> 02:19:59.850]  Those that want to eat Hot Pockets in their mom's basement, let them!
[02:20:01.539 --> 02:20:04.481]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:04.741 --> 02:20:11.946]  When the collapse happens, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered Delta Force nutrients to your family, fast.
[02:20:12.826 --> 02:20:15.548]  Like any Special Forces commando, you need a plan.

[02:20:18.470 --> 02:20:21.572]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.

[02:21:29.984 --> 02:21:31.045]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:21:31.225 --> 02:21:35.608]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:21:35.788 --> 02:21:41.492]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:21:41.592 --> 02:21:45.014]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:21:45.234 --> 02:21:47.836]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:47.956 --> 02:21:52.859]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:21:53.019 --> 02:21:53.240]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:53.260 --> 02:21:54.661]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.084 --> 02:22:02.385]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:22:02.465 --> 02:22:04.685]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:22:04.785 --> 02:22:07.586]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:12.748]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.108 --> 02:22:17.289]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:17.609 --> 02:22:19.972]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.072 --> 02:22:22.475]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:22:22.835 --> 02:22:25.418]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:25.758 --> 02:22:33.367]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:33.689 --> 02:22:38.972]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.092 --> 02:22:41.834]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:41.934 --> 02:22:45.376]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:22:45.616 --> 02:22:46.517]  And I got news for you.
[02:22:46.697 --> 02:22:47.978]  You're everyone else.
[02:22:48.018 --> 02:22:49.138]  Invisible Empire.

[02:24:01.307 --> 02:24:10.200]  While you were sleeping, they came and took it all away.
[02:24:11.024 --> 02:24:18.410]  Oh yeah, Lindsey, sorry we hit that break, but I've analyzed all the things that Mr. Fromm and the other guy told you, and they've all come true except for one of them.
[02:24:19.511 --> 02:24:26.057]  And when you got one of these old guys, some of it's going to be speculation, like they won't fix that oil leak, it's under too much pressure.
[02:24:26.597 --> 02:24:30.240]  Well, they did fix most of it, it's still leaking today out of fractures.
[02:24:32.482 --> 02:24:34.784]  But I mean, you know, nobody's infallible.
[02:24:35.425 --> 02:24:38.848]  But I mean, if people don't like what you're saying and, you know, telling them,
[02:24:39.688 --> 02:24:42.691]  When you've been right about 95% of the time, then they don't need to listen.
[02:24:42.991 --> 02:24:45.033]  So that's why I say don't spend time on that, Lindsey.
[02:24:45.593 --> 02:24:49.636]  Let's go to phone calls while we've got you here today, and we appreciate you joining us.
[02:24:50.137 --> 02:24:53.300]  Larry in Iowa, then Mike, Joe, Joe, Michael, and others.
[02:24:53.680 --> 02:24:56.282]  Larry, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams with a question or comment.
[02:24:57.023 --> 02:24:59.345]  V for victory, and we are the resistance.
[02:24:59.665 --> 02:25:01.486]  Nice to talk to you guys.
[02:25:01.706 --> 02:25:05.149]  I got a proposal about
[02:25:06.383 --> 02:25:22.379]  You know, nationalizing our domestic oil, and you'd have to do that in conjunction probably with abolishing the Fed and getting a panel of patriot economists to govern that, but I haven't really heard that talked about much.
[02:25:24.882 --> 02:25:25.622]  Comments, Lindsey?
[02:25:26.930 --> 02:25:27.550]  Uh, yes.
[02:25:27.890 --> 02:25:37.774]  How do you default, or how do they, the elite, how do they default on the national debt graciously and have an excuse for doing it?
[02:25:38.254 --> 02:25:40.655]  I think this is basically what I recall us talking about.
[02:25:41.275 --> 02:25:42.135]  This will happen.
[02:25:42.716 --> 02:25:48.938]  And the only way in the world for those two bills and Federal Reserve issues to basically default
[02:25:49.818 --> 02:25:51.399]  They'll never pay off the national debt.
[02:25:51.419 --> 02:25:51.920]  They know that.
[02:25:52.460 --> 02:25:57.544]  The interest on the national debt can't be paid anymore because countries are not coming in and buying the Federal Reserve issues.
[02:25:57.944 --> 02:26:00.666]  How do they default on this and get out of it graciously?
[02:26:00.966 --> 02:26:01.686]  Only one way.
[02:26:02.067 --> 02:26:05.289]  Conflict the Middle East, take crude oil prices so high,
[02:26:05.869 --> 02:26:14.812]  The American economy continues to disintegrate until the American dollar becomes almost worthless, and you take a word bar load to the grocery store to get a loaf of bread.
[02:26:15.192 --> 02:26:29.336]  At that point, it will be very easy to default on the national debt of $14 trillion, the T-bills that China, all the oil-producing countries of the world have bought over these years since Mr. Kissinger made the deal with them.
[02:26:29.856 --> 02:26:37.863]  At that point, they are bankrupt overnight and they realize that they have been double-crossed.
[02:26:37.963 --> 02:26:43.048]  It is a gross way of getting out from under the national debt graciously.
[02:26:45.550 --> 02:26:46.071]  All right.
[02:26:46.651 --> 02:26:48.653]  Thank you so much, Larry.
[02:26:48.713 --> 02:26:50.635]  Let's talk to Mike in North Carolina.
[02:26:50.675 --> 02:26:51.596]  You're on the air, Mike.
[02:26:52.797 --> 02:26:54.078]  Hey, Alex and Pastor Williams.
[02:26:54.098 --> 02:26:54.779]  How's everybody today?
[02:26:55.905 --> 02:26:56.105]  Good.
[02:26:56.346 --> 02:26:58.889]  Pastor Williams, as a God-fearing man, I'm sure you are.
[02:26:59.711 --> 02:27:01.553]  Where's the religion aspect in all this?
[02:27:02.375 --> 02:27:07.883]  I mean, if people aren't awake to what's really going on in the world, they're dumber than a box of rocks.
[02:27:08.123 --> 02:27:11.007]  And unfortunately, with God, if you
[02:27:13.236 --> 02:27:26.028]  Well, a lot of people claim they speak for God and so you got all these denominations controlled by the World Council of Churches and the clergy response teams run by the FEMA and the federal government telling people to love tyranny.
[02:27:26.449 --> 02:27:28.330]  So the church is absent in America.
[02:27:28.811 --> 02:27:33.755]  The real church helped found this country and now the counterfeit church is helping kill this country.
[02:27:33.795 --> 02:27:34.977]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[02:27:35.017 --> 02:27:36.178]  Any comments on that, Lindsey?
[02:27:36.994 --> 02:27:38.375]  Devil's Messiah.
[02:27:38.575 --> 02:27:42.058]  You remember I gave this on your program back, oh, about two, three years ago.
[02:27:42.078 --> 02:27:44.440]  Yeah, that's their term for taking over the church.
[02:27:45.261 --> 02:27:53.628]  Yeah, every bit of it fits in because they had to destroy the God that made America great in order to be able to bring about their new world order.
[02:27:54.008 --> 02:27:58.632]  And you must understand what they're talking about when they say the Devil's Messiah.
[02:27:58.892 --> 02:28:02.015]  Now, yes, I'm very upset with the ministers of America today also.
[02:28:02.535 --> 02:28:04.556]  But I'm also the American people.
[02:28:04.656 --> 02:28:05.437]  It's so sad.
[02:28:05.857 --> 02:28:10.640]  All down through history, man has worshipped something I have never seen.
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:12.001]  And I'm a history student.
[02:28:12.021 --> 02:28:13.442]  I minored in history in college.
[02:28:13.822 --> 02:28:19.786]  I have never seen a time when human beings seem to have no God-consciousness as much as they do today.
[02:28:20.006 --> 02:28:21.447]  It is very disturbing to me.
[02:28:21.767 --> 02:28:25.129]  Because if ever people should be turning to God... Well, they're empty.
[02:28:25.149 --> 02:28:26.049]  I mean, they're empty.
[02:28:26.069 --> 02:28:27.430]  They're not tuned into things.
[02:28:27.450 --> 02:28:31.833]  They're just kind of like bestial zombies running around gibbering like demons.
[02:28:32.433 --> 02:28:34.614]  Yeah, all down through history, they've worshipped something.
[02:28:34.634 --> 02:28:39.395]  If it wasn't anything but a stick or a stone or the sun or the moon, they worshipped something.
[02:28:39.675 --> 02:28:49.777]  But today, people seem to have no God consciousness of worshipping anything, and it's appalling at the very time they should be turning to Him for answers, Alex.
[02:28:51.038 --> 02:28:52.258]  Very well said, Lindsey Williams.
[02:28:52.278 --> 02:28:54.398]  Let's cram in one more long segment coming up.
[02:28:54.799 --> 02:28:56.139]  Joe in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:28:56.179 --> 02:28:56.559]  Go ahead.
[02:28:57.639 --> 02:28:58.620]  Hi, how are you, Alex?
[02:28:58.820 --> 02:28:59.500]  How are you, Lindsey?
[02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:00.120]  We're good.
[02:29:00.160 --> 02:29:00.540]  Hi, Joe.
[02:29:01.371 --> 02:29:03.932]  All right, big fan of both of you guys.
[02:29:04.052 --> 02:29:05.472]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:29:06.092 --> 02:29:08.433]  I just have a question for people on fixed incomes.
[02:29:09.253 --> 02:29:29.778]  Okay, I noticed you had a call from somebody who was disabled at a young age the other day, but if you wanted to invest principal and needed to hedge, you know, to protect your principal against the devaluation of the dollar, but needed some type of dividends from your principal, you know, because you didn't count on your SSI,
[02:29:30.856 --> 02:29:31.456]  In the future?
[02:29:33.077 --> 02:29:35.098]  What would be a safe investment?
[02:29:35.159 --> 02:29:37.180]  Okay, we'll try to answer that on the other side.
[02:29:37.740 --> 02:29:41.162]  Going into a meltdown like this, there's no silver bullet, but I'll give you my view.
[02:29:41.202 --> 02:29:42.743]  We'll get Pastor Lindsey Williams for you.
[02:29:43.123 --> 02:29:43.703]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:29:43.723 --> 02:29:47.005]  Then we'll talk to Joe in Pennsylvania, Michael, John, Jack, and others.
[02:29:47.105 --> 02:29:47.586]  Stay with us.
[02:29:50.988 --> 02:29:51.888]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.388 --> 02:29:53.969]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.930 --> 02:29:57.611]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.609 --> 02:30:04.832]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.152 --> 02:30:05.753]  Number 1.
[02:30:06.073 --> 02:30:09.215]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.496 --> 02:30:10.056]  Number 2.
[02:30:10.356 --> 02:30:14.920]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:15.700]  It's true.
[02:30:15.980 --> 02:30:20.544]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:20.864 --> 02:30:21.404]  Number 3.
[02:30:21.685 --> 02:30:24.967]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.267 --> 02:30:28.970]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.170 --> 02:30:29.730]  Number four.
[02:30:29.970 --> 02:30:32.331]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:32.731 --> 02:30:36.112]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:36.412 --> 02:30:36.952]  Number five.
[02:30:37.192 --> 02:30:41.113]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.333 --> 02:30:46.115]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.395 --> 02:30:50.416]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:50.576 --> 02:30:52.137]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:00.359 --> 02:31:03.820]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:08.242]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[02:31:08.482 --> 02:31:13.504]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[02:31:13.604 --> 02:31:18.346]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[02:31:19.106 --> 02:31:26.229]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[02:31:28.903 --> 02:31:33.349]  I'm looking for America.
[02:31:34.430 --> 02:31:35.892]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:31:36.072 --> 02:31:39.015]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:31:39.035 --> 02:31:42.880]  Land of the free and the home of the brave.
[02:31:43.300 --> 02:31:47.025]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[02:31:54.853 --> 02:31:59.426]  And you, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[02:32:01.374 --> 02:32:08.057]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[02:32:08.397 --> 02:32:10.638]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[02:32:11.058 --> 02:32:16.440]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February.
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:19.881]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[02:32:20.101 --> 02:32:28.004]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[02:32:28.364 --> 02:32:30.205]  Move quickly while you can still afford it.
[02:32:30.465 --> 02:32:33.187]  And eFoodsDirect will pay your shipping costs for you.

[02:33:09.893 --> 02:33:13.342]  On the march, the empire is on the run.
[02:33:14.104 --> 02:33:17.813]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:33.493 --> 02:33:37.776]  By the way, folks, don't forget the online video bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[02:33:37.836 --> 02:33:44.140]  It is so vital that everyone you know sees Fall of the Republic, Invisible Empire, Obama Deception.
[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:52.526]  Those three films cover the global banking cartel, who they are, what they're doing with energy, their admitted global stratagem for control.
[02:33:52.966 --> 02:33:55.107]  Yes, you know all about it.
[02:33:55.548 --> 02:33:57.529]  People don't wake up by osmosis.
[02:33:57.569 --> 02:34:00.071]  You've got to reach out to others.
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:06.544]  You've got to see yourselves as who you really are, leaders in this fight.
[02:34:07.325 --> 02:34:09.146]  Please visit InfoWars.com.
[02:34:09.246 --> 02:34:10.447]  Get the books, the videos.
[02:34:10.467 --> 02:34:11.808]  Yes, it'll support us as well.
[02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:20.195]  But more importantly, these are well-produced, powerfully prepared, truthful weapons in the information war.

[02:34:27.608 --> 02:34:44.772]  I want to continue racing through your phone calls here with Lindsey Williams, but answering Joe and Florida's question, I would just give the answer that you want to invest in something where you get a return, you know, where it's a safe investment and you get a dividend.
[02:34:46.270 --> 02:34:51.572]  And, you know, they always say hedge your bets and things, but then people never understand gold and silver.
[02:34:51.612 --> 02:34:58.876]  They go, wait, I buy gold and silver now, and as the dollar devalues, later I cash it in for the dollar, but those are still worthless dollars.
[02:34:58.936 --> 02:35:00.456]  No, they've been devalued.
[02:35:00.496 --> 02:35:04.658]  So let's say you buy gold at $260 an ounce 11 years ago, and now it's $1,430 or whatever it's at today.
[02:35:04.718 --> 02:35:06.639]  Well, what's gold today?
[02:35:06.659 --> 02:35:06.639]  $1,440.
[02:35:06.699 --> 02:35:07.119]  I forget.
[02:35:07.139 --> 02:35:07.419]  The point is,
[02:35:14.790 --> 02:35:18.754]  So see, the dollars devalued that much in 11 years.
[02:35:19.715 --> 02:35:23.859]  From 260-something an ounce to 1,400-something an ounce.
[02:35:24.220 --> 02:35:29.125]  And so now you go turn that gold coin in, you bought a 260, that ounce, and they go, here's 1,430-something dollars or more!
[02:35:33.263 --> 02:35:35.225]  And people are like, I don't understand what you're saying.
[02:35:35.265 --> 02:35:36.046]  That's too confusing.
[02:35:36.566 --> 02:35:38.669]  And I'm like, I don't know what else I can do for you.
[02:35:38.829 --> 02:35:39.990]  I just don't.
[02:35:40.190 --> 02:35:41.331]  I can't help him.
[02:35:42.412 --> 02:35:43.493]  I mean, I really can't help.
[02:35:44.474 --> 02:35:45.716]  And maybe I'm the bad man.
[02:35:45.916 --> 02:35:48.819]  Maybe Lindsey's bad for telling you oil would go up and it's right again.
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:55.384]  In fact, we should probably apologize right now that we said buy gold and silver, and they're both up over 400 percent.
[02:35:57.025 --> 02:35:59.426]  But, I mean, and there are some other investments.
[02:35:59.486 --> 02:36:03.609]  If you've got enough money, you could buy into the right farming stocks, the right commodity stocks.
[02:36:03.649 --> 02:36:06.631]  We told you that with investor experts the last decade.
[02:36:06.671 --> 02:36:07.752]  We've been right on every front.
[02:36:08.733 --> 02:36:10.254]  It's not that we're even smart.
[02:36:10.314 --> 02:36:14.537]  The globalists all invest in this while telling chumps to invest in everything else.
[02:36:16.764 --> 02:36:18.946]  It's like telling people not to play in traffic.
[02:36:19.527 --> 02:36:22.510]  I mean, Lindsey, does it ever... and I'm not saying the caller's question was stupid.
[02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:25.753]  I just keep going back to people that still don't understand gold and silver.
[02:36:26.193 --> 02:36:30.738]  They're like, why do you want my fiat money if it ain't worth nothing?
[02:36:30.758 --> 02:36:33.380]  Well, because then we take it and we get gold ourselves.
[02:36:33.781 --> 02:36:38.906]  Well, then what do you cash the gold in for if it's gonna be fiat?
[02:36:39.506 --> 02:36:43.973]  But the fiat's been devalued, so then I'll get more of it back.
[02:36:44.453 --> 02:36:46.456]  It freezes the inflation.
[02:36:46.476 --> 02:36:47.758]  They're like, huh?
[02:36:48.379 --> 02:36:52.304]  And sometimes you just can't, you can lead a horse to water, you can't make them drink, Lindsey.
[02:36:53.203 --> 02:37:01.106]  Alex, right here on your show, InfoWars, three years ago, I'm sure that your producer can go back and pull it up if he wants to.
[02:37:01.126 --> 02:37:06.949]  I said that I had just been on the phone with my elitist friend, and I was exasperated.
[02:37:07.629 --> 02:37:13.291]  I look at my own son and my wife and my family, and I say, how can I provide for them?
[02:37:13.531 --> 02:37:16.913]  This man had told me what they were going to do, how the price was going up.
[02:37:17.493 --> 02:37:18.613]  From 147 to 50.
[02:37:18.653 --> 02:37:21.734]  How it was going to stay there for two and a half years.
[02:37:21.994 --> 02:37:23.055]  How it would go back up again.
[02:37:23.315 --> 02:37:26.276]  He did not tell me about the Middle East crisis right now until later.
[02:37:26.656 --> 02:37:29.697]  And at the time, I said, what can I do?
[02:37:30.177 --> 02:37:31.377]  I said, my family.
[02:37:31.977 --> 02:37:32.697]  What do I do?
[02:37:33.017 --> 02:37:37.879]  He said to me, he said, Chaplain, there is only one way that you can spare your assets.
[02:37:37.979 --> 02:37:39.919]  And he said, that is our currency.
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:41.720]  Alex, you'll remember me saying that.
[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:43.982]  He said, it is our currency.
[02:37:44.302 --> 02:37:45.323]  I asked him the question.
[02:37:45.383 --> 02:37:47.024]  I said, what is your currency?
[02:37:47.365 --> 02:37:49.406]  He said, our currency is gold and silver.
[02:37:49.426 --> 02:37:53.089]  He said, if it's written on a piece of paper, it's worth the paper it's written on.
[02:37:53.349 --> 02:38:00.035]  And I came back on your show three years ago, and I said, when you could buy gold for $700 an ounce, I begged with you.
[02:38:00.055 --> 02:38:01.276]  I pleaded with you.
[02:38:01.536 --> 02:38:06.721]  I did everything but got on my knees and cried and asked you to go and buy gold at $700 an ounce.
[02:38:08.482 --> 02:38:11.583]  And I want you to apologize right now, and I'm going to apologize.
[02:38:12.043 --> 02:38:14.004]  I'm sorry I told people to buy it at $260.
[02:38:14.484 --> 02:38:20.346]  I'm sorry I told people to buy silver at $5, and now it's at $35.
[02:38:21.186 --> 02:38:23.887]  Lindsey, you're bad for telling the truth and being right.
[02:38:24.207 --> 02:38:24.727]  I'm bad.
[02:38:25.087 --> 02:38:25.708]  We're bad.
[02:38:26.068 --> 02:38:29.369]  The government lying to people on purpose, they're good.
[02:38:29.889 --> 02:38:35.591]  And you're bad, and I'm bad, and we're evil.
[02:38:37.833 --> 02:38:44.515]  As a result, I said it on your show, today it's $1,400 and folks, I'm telling you where it's going from here.
[02:38:44.575 --> 02:38:45.216]  Are you listening?
[02:38:45.596 --> 02:38:46.136]  Please.
[02:38:46.616 --> 02:38:51.037]  I'm going to apologize for this a year from now, as we're having to do right now.
[02:38:51.257 --> 02:38:53.198]  I'm going to tell you where they have told me it's going.
[02:38:53.578 --> 02:38:58.120]  It is going to $2,000 and $3,000 an ounce for gold.
[02:38:58.240 --> 02:39:02.181]  Mark my words, put it down beside your talent, but don't you call me a prophet.
[02:39:02.561 --> 02:39:06.844]  You say that Mr. Williams' elite friend told him, and why are they going to take it there?
[02:39:06.884 --> 02:39:07.784]  There's a reason why.
[02:39:07.804 --> 02:39:10.886]  This is just as important as the fact that it's going there.
[02:39:11.266 --> 02:39:16.750]  Because the Dollar Ruby did, I didn't say non-existent, did by the end of 2012, and in order to bring in a new
[02:39:19.291 --> 02:39:23.055]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about this for years, folks.
[02:39:23.415 --> 02:39:26.338]  Please believe every word you hear him say on InfoWars.
[02:39:26.578 --> 02:39:28.620]  Listen to him every day and don't miss a word of it.
[02:39:29.001 --> 02:39:32.404]  Whenever they come out with a new world currency, it will be backed by gold.
[02:39:32.424 --> 02:39:33.885]  They cannot do it at $1,000 an ounce or $250 an ounce.
[02:39:34.045 --> 02:39:35.787]  They've got to do it at $3,000 to $4,000 an ounce.
[02:39:42.433 --> 02:39:43.734]  And we'll be bad guys again!
[02:39:43.754 --> 02:39:44.594]  We'll be evil!
[02:39:44.614 --> 02:39:45.014]  We're bad!
[02:39:58.578 --> 02:40:04.604]  We're bad for... Why is it in this sick, demonic world now, though, that telling the truth and being right is bad?
[02:40:04.844 --> 02:40:06.325]  When you're wrong, you're hailed.
[02:40:06.365 --> 02:40:15.394]  It's like, oh, you know, these guys on TV keep lying to me and giving me bad info, but they're wearing fancy suits with teleprompters, but then when you're right, it's bad.
[02:40:17.065 --> 02:40:18.246]  Well, Alex, you've been right.
[02:40:18.306 --> 02:40:19.506]  You've been right over the years.
[02:40:19.526 --> 02:40:21.988]  I followed you before you ever even knew me.
[02:40:22.008 --> 02:40:27.070]  And what you've said has come true exactly as you've said it.
[02:40:27.811 --> 02:40:29.932]  You got yours from many different sources.
[02:40:30.352 --> 02:40:36.596]  I received mine from the elite only, two of them in particular, who over these years have been willing to give me this information.
[02:40:37.036 --> 02:40:40.518]  And then, of course, the latest one, who said, I'm too old to care.
[02:40:40.778 --> 02:40:42.239]  This is going to tell the world everything.
[02:40:42.479 --> 02:40:44.740]  And, Alex, at that point, I pulled out all the stops.
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.141]  In total, everything.
[02:40:46.161 --> 02:40:47.782]  And I haven't ceased doing it.
[02:40:48.202 --> 02:40:50.244]  I'm not going to either.
[02:40:50.484 --> 02:40:52.165]  Because you've got to know what's going on.
[02:40:52.385 --> 02:40:55.447]  You do not have to lose sleep over this.
[02:40:55.487 --> 02:40:59.510]  You do not need to look for black helicopters and look behind bushes.
[02:40:59.890 --> 02:41:13.459]  If you take the advice of the elite, because they're the ones that are doing it, and do what would seem right to do in light of what they're going to do, you can spare yourself heartache and pain in light of what's about to happen.
[02:41:13.499 --> 02:41:14.700]  What the inevitable is, Alex.
[02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:16.261]  Absolutely.
[02:41:16.281 --> 02:41:19.262]  I want to go back to the calls, and of course I was being sarcastic earlier.
[02:41:19.362 --> 02:41:22.304]  We should be appreciated and thanked, and we are by many people.
[02:41:23.084 --> 02:41:37.372]  It's just that the gibbering masses who will not take our advice become more enraged as we become more and more confirmed, as everything we talk about becomes more and more certified and bona fide.
[02:41:38.512 --> 02:41:43.035]  They become more fearful, and they say, it's your fault the economy's imploding.
[02:41:43.075 --> 02:41:44.295]  You destroyed confidence.
[02:41:45.096 --> 02:41:47.797]  Or, no, gold and silver isn't a good investment.
[02:41:47.977 --> 02:41:50.939]  Or, you didn't say oil was going to go up.
[02:41:51.059 --> 02:41:52.000]  It's not true.
[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:57.523]  And it's, I mean, I've run into this with more distant family at family reunions and events.
[02:41:58.789 --> 02:42:12.632]  I'll see cousins in people, or some of my in-laws' family, and I'll tell them, remember six, seven years ago at the birthday party, I said, buy gold, and it was 400 bucks an ounce then.
[02:42:12.652 --> 02:42:17.613]  And they go, yeah, I know, but what are you, a financial planner?
[02:42:18.033 --> 02:42:19.033]  You advise?
[02:42:19.073 --> 02:42:21.194]  And I go, well, now it's gone up 300, 400 bucks.
[02:42:23.434 --> 02:42:24.375]  Yeah, it's the best.
[02:42:24.395 --> 02:42:25.195]  But hold on, hold on.
[02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:31.780]  And then I saw him again about a year ago, and I said, well, it was $300, and now it's, you know, almost $1,400.
[02:42:32.340 --> 02:42:40.405]  And I said, and they thought I was showing off to put him down and laughed at me and said I basically had no financial acumen.
[02:42:40.705 --> 02:42:42.467]  And I said, but wait, I was right.
[02:42:42.807 --> 02:42:47.110]  I'm trying to tell you this to help you, not to show off, you stupid yuppie.
[02:42:47.590 --> 02:42:51.853]  You know, I mean, it's like, it's like they're drowning out there in the water.
[02:42:52.393 --> 02:42:57.214]  And you try to throw them a life raft and they stab it with daggers and go, no!
[02:42:57.574 --> 02:42:58.635]  Don't show off!
[02:42:59.255 --> 02:43:00.475]  Just stab, stab.
[02:43:00.495 --> 02:43:03.776]  It's like, it's like they want to be run over.
[02:43:03.796 --> 02:43:05.177]  The people want to lose.
[02:43:05.217 --> 02:43:06.257]  They want to fail.
[02:43:06.477 --> 02:43:08.397]  Their religion is about being weak.
[02:43:08.838 --> 02:43:09.158]  I don't know.
[02:43:09.198 --> 02:43:10.118]  What do you call that?
[02:43:11.823 --> 02:43:15.405]  The greatest financial planner on the face of this earth, Alex, is the elite.
[02:43:15.805 --> 02:43:17.506]  All you've got to do is listen to them.
[02:43:18.046 --> 02:43:21.308]  And I've written three books trying to explain the mindset of these people.
[02:43:21.348 --> 02:43:22.649]  All three of them are out of print now.
[02:43:22.689 --> 02:43:24.850]  Maybe I should put all three of them back in print again.
[02:43:25.310 --> 02:43:35.315]  When you understand new world order from Danny Bush, when you understand a thousand points of light from Danny Bush, you'll be able to know exactly what to do.
[02:43:35.595 --> 02:43:37.076]  Listen to the elite.
[02:43:37.516 --> 02:43:38.537]  I listen to my friends.
[02:43:39.097 --> 02:43:44.203]  And when they said that gold was the only thing I could spare my assets in, I invested in gold and silver.
[02:43:44.223 --> 02:43:47.186]  Let me say emphatically right now, I do not sell gold and silver.
[02:43:47.427 --> 02:43:49.849]  You couldn't buy a penny from me if you tried to.
[02:43:50.430 --> 02:43:53.433]  Alex has people on his show tell you where to go and buy it from.
[02:43:53.754 --> 02:43:58.059]  All I'm trying to do is tell you the truth so you can spare your dinner table in coming days, Alex.
[02:43:59.738 --> 02:44:02.221]  Well, to be clear, I sure sell gold and silver.
[02:44:02.241 --> 02:44:06.186]  And I try to get folks to buy firearms, too, even though I don't sell firearms.
[02:44:06.206 --> 02:44:07.488]  We need some sponsors, by the way.
[02:44:07.528 --> 02:44:08.749]  Good firearms manufacturers.
[02:44:09.610 --> 02:44:12.534]  I mean, I promote what I believe in because I sleep good at night.
[02:44:13.094 --> 02:44:15.938]  And I hope folks call Midas Resources and take advantage of those
[02:44:16.018 --> 02:44:19.959]  Three silver dollars, three of my best-selling films, and free shipping for $110.
[02:44:20.339 --> 02:44:22.299]  That's about a $65 value.
[02:44:22.339 --> 02:44:27.240]  You can't beat it.
[02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:28.220]  800-686-2237.
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:30.581]  800-686-2237.
[02:44:30.621 --> 02:44:31.381]  Don't screw around.
[02:44:31.401 --> 02:44:31.841]  Don't wait.
[02:44:32.081 --> 02:44:33.061]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:44:33.841 --> 02:44:35.942]  But, Joe, other investments for you?
[02:44:35.982 --> 02:44:42.463]  Look, I don't know your personal standing or the lay of your financial landscape, so I can't give you advice.
[02:44:43.539 --> 02:44:44.199]  I feel sorry for you.
[02:44:44.219 --> 02:44:48.700]  Maybe if you used a paper and crayon and used smaller words that could help.
[02:45:08.769 --> 02:45:17.891]  I got my book, my DVDs, and my four gold or silver coins from Minus Resources when it was $27 an ounce.
[02:45:19.211 --> 02:45:22.452]  But anyway... And now it's $35 an ounce.
[02:45:22.572 --> 02:45:23.692]  I apologize.
[02:45:23.972 --> 02:45:26.872]  You must have bought that a week or two ago and you've made a huge profit.
[02:45:27.152 --> 02:45:28.533]  I'm sorry, Joe.
[02:45:28.913 --> 02:45:31.733]  Well, your apologies... No, tell me I'm bad right now.
[02:45:31.813 --> 02:45:32.393]  I'm scum.
[02:45:32.693 --> 02:45:34.094]  You're horrible for making me money.
[02:45:34.314 --> 02:45:35.514]  Okay, okay, I apologize.
[02:45:36.034 --> 02:45:36.634]  You're horrible.
[02:45:37.563 --> 02:46:03.876]  Um, but for Mr. Williams, it's an honor to talk to you, and you answered part of my question while I was listening, but I'm going back to when Kissinger made the deal with the Middle East about selling the oil and the dollars and that they would have to buy a certain amount of our bonds, and then I was listening another time when you were talking with Alex, and he said that
[02:46:05.743 --> 02:46:11.245]  They're going to open up the North Slope in Alaska and other oil fields that we have in this country.
[02:46:12.005 --> 02:46:13.326]  Now, my question is this.
[02:46:14.026 --> 02:46:30.131]  Do you think that the elite, because the Middle East said, you know what, we're not going to sell in dollars anymore, we're going to get out of this, that they had this planned all along and they're kind of like spanking the Middle East on the rear end saying, this is what you get for messing with us.
[02:46:31.391 --> 02:46:33.172]  And my next question after that was,
[02:46:34.107 --> 02:46:40.641]  As far as investing, what do you think about investing in oil futures now, knowing that it's going to go up to make money?
[02:46:41.042 --> 02:46:44.409]  Well, it's so detailed and complex... I'm sorry, go ahead, Lindsey.
[02:46:44.929 --> 02:46:46.090]  Yeah, they're planning a complete meltdown!
[02:47:14.744 --> 02:47:16.686]  That's why they're preparing foreign trips.
[02:47:16.726 --> 02:47:17.667]  It doesn't mean they'll do it.
[02:47:18.147 --> 02:47:19.408]  It doesn't mean they'll go all the way.
[02:47:19.769 --> 02:47:24.333]  But on this continuum of force, we know they're going to project it downfield.
[02:47:24.653 --> 02:47:30.999]  We don't know if they're going to get 20 yards, 50 yards, 100 yards, or how much force they want to use on the lever.
[02:47:31.019 --> 02:47:32.660]  They don't want to blow their race car engine.
[02:47:32.981 --> 02:47:38.125]  But the point is, they're ready and committed to their plan with absolute military occupation.
[02:47:39.066 --> 02:47:42.467]  Total destruction of all currency and total enslavement.
[02:47:42.707 --> 02:47:45.028]  I mean, that's on the table.
[02:47:45.528 --> 02:47:46.148]  Pastor Williams?
[02:47:46.868 --> 02:47:47.888]  Default on the debt.
[02:47:47.928 --> 02:47:48.908]  You're exactly right.
[02:47:49.189 --> 02:47:56.990]  They have to find a gracious manner in order to default on this debt so that the American people will not accuse them of all the problems that they've created.
[02:47:57.350 --> 02:47:58.311]  And they're going to do it.
[02:47:58.731 --> 02:48:04.112]  And this is what I give in my very latest DVD series, The Middle East and the Rest of the Crisis.
[02:48:04.132 --> 02:48:07.553]  I tell the intricate details of how they're doing all of this.
[02:48:07.973 --> 02:48:09.175]  Well, they're financed by the
[02:48:24.414 --> 02:48:27.735]  They're financed by MI6 and Soros on record.
[02:48:28.035 --> 02:48:31.036]  Here's The Economist just as the world economy was recovering.
[02:48:31.276 --> 02:48:32.316]  It was never recovering.
[02:48:34.017 --> 02:48:40.459]  It shows the globe with an oil barrel as a bomb with a fuse on it about to blow the planet up.
[02:48:40.919 --> 02:48:44.200]  And I've already seen, and I predicted this a few months ago, but now you see them doing it.
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:46.220]  Because you know their next play when you study them.
[02:48:46.540 --> 02:49:03.203]  They're already scapegoating the global financial meltdown on what's happening in the Middle East, exactly what you said four and a half, five months ago, that they would destroy the Arabs because they're the biggest owner in the aggregate of the debt, thus mortally wounding the dollar.
[02:49:03.483 --> 02:49:08.864]  That's why the Wall Street Journal came out on Monday and said the end of the dollar
[02:49:09.404 --> 02:49:10.205]  is here.
[02:49:10.225 --> 02:49:11.765]  In fact, let me pull out that article.
[02:49:12.045 --> 02:49:16.408]  They said the end of the dollar is nigh, and promoted it like it was a good deal.
[02:49:16.708 --> 02:49:20.630]  They are bringing in the chaos to then bring in their order.
[02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:24.392]  It is their stratagem, and people ignore that at their peril.
[02:49:24.752 --> 02:49:25.852]  Joe, I appreciate your call.
[02:49:25.873 --> 02:49:36.338]  We're going to keep Lindsay five minutes in the next hour, then Aaron Dykes for a segment or two with information that, again, dovetails with all of this with the absolute treason, brazen
[02:49:36.918 --> 02:49:43.362]  Mafia takeover of the coal-powered plants, because they're not just going to cut off the oil from the Middle East.
[02:49:43.382 --> 02:49:47.144]  They want to shut down all their competition, rape us more financially.
[02:49:47.505 --> 02:49:52.467]  You think your power bill doubling on average in the last two years of Obama shutting down power plants is anything?
[02:49:52.868 --> 02:49:55.769]  The head of the Energy Department says they're going to shut down massive amounts.
[02:49:56.270 --> 02:50:00.452]  Anybody who isn't George Soros or General Electric running the White House is over.
[02:50:00.913 --> 02:50:01.653]  It is over.
[02:50:01.953 --> 02:50:03.234]  These people are mafia.
[02:50:03.294 --> 02:50:04.175]  They are brutal.
[02:50:04.695 --> 02:50:05.916]  And then when the poor people are
[02:50:07.677 --> 02:50:20.485]  Starving in the streets, they'll turn them loose on the general public and demand total socialism to feed chicken feed to the starving unwashed masses, who will then become their brown shirt TSA goons, who will slit your family's throat with pleasure.
[02:50:20.765 --> 02:50:22.526]  I'm not trying to scare you, this is the facts.
[02:50:22.847 --> 02:50:27.230]  If you want the Middle East, the rest of the story, it's available at prophecyclub.com.
[02:50:27.550 --> 02:50:31.853]  The new 3-DVD set that Lindsey's laid out, now shipping out to folks, finally got it done.
[02:50:32.813 --> 02:50:34.975]  And give them the number if they want to call and get it, Lindsey.
[02:50:35.615 --> 02:50:37.557]  The first ones will be shipped out on Friday.
[02:50:37.677 --> 02:50:39.098]  Not one has been shipped yet.
[02:50:39.559 --> 02:50:42.041]  It turned out to be three hours instead of one.
[02:50:42.101 --> 02:50:48.607]  You who purchased a number of weeks ago, you're going to get three DVDs instead of the two.
[02:50:49.248 --> 02:50:50.509]  We couldn't do it any shorter.
[02:50:50.649 --> 02:50:51.991]  You gotta give the number out, Lindsey.
[02:50:52.011 --> 02:50:52.932]  We're about to hit the break.
[02:50:53.032 --> 02:50:55.034]  The number is 888-799-6111.
[02:50:55.254 --> 02:50:59.117]  We're going to get six operators standing by.
[02:50:59.137 --> 02:50:59.598]  Stay there.
[02:50:59.758 --> 02:51:00.078]  Stay there.
[02:51:01.087 --> 02:51:07.372]  Imagine being free of debt in just 12 weeks without payment plans or negotiating or hiring an attorney.
[02:51:08.033 --> 02:51:13.577]  18 years ago, we cracked the code of debt collections and set tens of thousands of people free of their debts.
[02:51:13.978 --> 02:51:17.741]  It's called Zero Debt Guaranteed and it works for all debts.
[02:51:18.061 --> 02:51:19.561]  My wages were being garnished.
[02:51:19.862 --> 02:51:24.363]  So I used the program and the attorney dropped the case and he returned my money within two weeks.
[02:51:24.663 --> 02:51:28.444]  With zero debt guaranteed, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.504 --> 02:51:30.405]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.585 --> 02:51:32.585]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.

[02:52:02.006 --> 02:52:05.627]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:06.027 --> 02:52:09.028]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:09.268 --> 02:52:14.049]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:52:14.069 --> 02:52:20.290]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:22.691]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:52:23.251 --> 02:52:23.531]  Tim Geithner?
[02:52:23.551 --> 02:52:23.772]  Bernanke?
[02:52:23.792 --> 02:52:24.372]  They're arsonists!
[02:52:24.392 --> 02:52:25.153]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:25.173 --> 02:52:26.855]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.133 --> 02:52:49.095]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:00.279 --> 02:53:02.280]  The collapse of the dollar is imminent.
[02:53:02.620 --> 02:53:13.323]  You can protect your wealth by buying gold, silver, and strong foreign currencies, but what if the government confiscates your precious metals, implements exchange controls, or nationalizes your retirement?
[02:53:13.503 --> 02:53:14.684]  You need a backup plan.
[02:53:14.784 --> 02:53:18.625]  That's why you must move your wealth into an offshore asset protection structure.

[02:53:51.143 --> 02:53:52.825]  Asset protection in financially unsafe times.
[02:54:14.198 --> 02:54:18.660]  We're going to go to Michael, John, Jack, Mark, and Joe.
[02:54:18.680 --> 02:54:26.583]  We're going to get that number out one more time for folks that want to be able to call and get those important DVDs and get the word out to people that Lindsey Williams is going to have shipping out on Friday.
[02:54:27.523 --> 02:54:32.245]  But continuing, here's some of the new news at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:33.205 --> 02:54:37.026]  Again, integrating them with exactly what Lindsey was just talking about.
[02:54:37.467 --> 02:54:40.788]  Day of Rage, Saudi Arabia in veiled threat
[02:54:41.468 --> 02:54:59.559]  To the United States, as the world braces itself for Saudi Arabia's Day of Rage on Friday, which many fear could be the spark that sends oil prices soaring beyond $200 a barrel mark, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal issued a veiled threat to the United States, warning that the kingdom was prepared to cut
[02:55:00.419 --> 02:55:03.400]  Foreign fingers in the event of any outside interference.
[02:55:03.980 --> 02:55:09.562]  See, Saudi Arabia now is figuring out they're being double-crossed because they're about to have their T-bills devalued.
[02:55:10.162 --> 02:55:13.743]  The Day of Rage has been organized by Saudi youths using Facebook.
[02:55:13.783 --> 02:55:14.824]  It's all CIA-run.
[02:55:15.544 --> 02:55:17.607]  Again, it's the globalists turning on their old puppets.
[02:55:18.168 --> 02:55:22.914]  Soros says communist Chinese model of order may become the envy of the world.
[02:55:23.334 --> 02:55:26.718]  Western democracies provide less successful leadership than China.
[02:55:27.119 --> 02:55:28.981]  That's more David Rockefeller propaganda.
[02:55:29.222 --> 02:55:30.463]  These people are open...
[02:55:31.164 --> 02:55:33.005]  Tyrannus Maximus.
[02:55:33.485 --> 02:55:34.666]  Maximum tyrants.
[02:55:34.846 --> 02:55:40.728]  I am... These people are a bunch of baby Stalin, baby Hitlers trying to get up on their legs, man.
[02:55:41.429 --> 02:55:47.151]  Stop licking their boots as they put in TSA body scanners nationwide and try to stick their hands down our pants.
[02:55:47.411 --> 02:55:48.772]  They're trying to break our will!
[02:55:50.083 --> 02:56:02.540]  Lindsey Williams, looking at this, I mean, you said it, the Middle East, four and a half months ago, the trigger for the global meltdown, their scapegoat, and now The Economist, Bilderberg Group publication, saying the exact same thing, Lindsey.
[02:56:03.989 --> 02:56:12.296]  In one of these days, after they have told you what they're doing, that those words, as Alec has just mentioned, tells you everything they're going to do.
[02:56:12.656 --> 02:56:18.581]  And then don't turn around a few months from now, after they've already done it, and say, we told you so, why didn't you listen?
[02:56:19.102 --> 02:56:26.648]  Alex, why don't people sit up and listen to what these people... You are going to be paying $6, $7, $8 a gallon to the gas pump.
[02:56:27.088 --> 02:56:28.791]  That'll be your fault for warning him!
[02:56:29.011 --> 02:56:31.936]  The bankers love him, the government's gonna help him, Michael Moore cares.
[02:56:32.297 --> 02:56:36.304]  We're gonna, before you leave us the next time, we're gonna give that number out again, but right now, let's jam these calls in.
[02:56:36.664 --> 02:56:38.267]  Michael, in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:56:38.307 --> 02:56:39.008]  Quick question, sir.
[02:56:40.151 --> 02:56:41.792]  Yes, question and quick comment.
[02:56:42.032 --> 02:56:43.954]  Gentlemen, don't feel bad about what you're doing.
[02:56:44.414 --> 02:56:47.256]  I'm almost embarrassed quoting the scripture with Lindsey here.
[02:56:47.616 --> 02:57:00.426]  Isaiah, the prophet, in chapter 30, verse 10, he threw his hands up in the air because he was trying to warn the people, and all they would do is come back to him and say, tell us illusions, tell us smooth things, tell us what we want to hear.
[02:57:00.706 --> 02:57:03.188]  This is human nature, gentlemen, so don't feel bad.
[02:57:03.568 --> 02:57:06.330]  You're warning the people, and the ones that listen,
[02:57:06.830 --> 02:57:07.531]  Have listened.
[02:57:07.931 --> 02:57:13.054]  I just placed another order with Ted Anderson's brother over at Midas Resources for Silver.
[02:57:13.094 --> 02:57:18.277]  I've been reading Porter Stansbury's publications for years.
[02:57:18.297 --> 02:57:22.980]  I just bought another membership at Front Sight to get my firearms training.
[02:57:23.556 --> 02:57:26.618]  The people who you're trying to warn, they're listening.
[02:57:26.638 --> 02:57:27.478]  So don't feel bad.
[02:57:27.498 --> 02:57:29.820]  This is just human nature.
[02:57:30.380 --> 02:57:34.182]  People have always been like this, and I don't understand it myself.
[02:57:34.202 --> 02:57:34.942]  No, they like to.
[02:57:34.983 --> 02:57:36.103]  Some of them like to lose.
[02:57:36.123 --> 02:57:37.104]  Do you have a question?
[02:57:37.164 --> 02:57:38.384]  Real quick, because we're almost out of time.
[02:57:38.404 --> 02:57:39.345]  I've got to get to other callers.
[02:57:39.645 --> 02:57:40.886]  Do you have any questions for Lindsey?
[02:57:41.701 --> 02:57:42.482]  Yeah, quick question.
[02:57:42.582 --> 02:57:49.407]  I understand, Pastor, that we're going to try to double-cross or we're going to double-cross Saudi Arabia.
[02:57:49.447 --> 02:57:51.588]  Now, they don't have a military to respond.
[02:57:51.888 --> 02:57:54.150]  We're their muscle in the Middle East.
[02:57:54.450 --> 02:57:57.092]  We're their protector as far as the military is concerned.
[02:57:57.312 --> 02:57:58.673]  The thing to worry about is China.
[02:57:58.733 --> 02:58:00.835]  We owe them a lot of money.
[02:58:01.275 --> 02:58:01.555]  Yeah.
[02:58:01.575 --> 02:58:02.016]  Yeah.
[02:58:13.351 --> 02:58:16.253]  Well, the other cost is going to be the default on the national debt.
[02:58:16.653 --> 02:58:19.675]  This has to happen because Washington knows they can't pay it off.
[02:58:20.235 --> 02:58:24.638]  And now the nations aren't showing up to buy the T-Bears and the Federal Reserve issues.
[02:58:25.138 --> 02:58:33.763]  And as a result, last week, I mean, this is startling, as of last week, the Federal Reserve surpassed China as the largest holder of United States debt.
[02:58:34.144 --> 02:58:38.426]  I mean, Mr. Trump told you... Yeah, the bankers are getting ready to cheat all the people that invested with them.
[02:58:38.446 --> 02:58:39.207]  Stay with us.
[02:58:43.272 --> 02:58:45.193]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.673 --> 02:58:49.014]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:50.635 --> 02:58:54.056]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:58:54.876 --> 02:58:55.777]  Tyranny is here.
[02:58:56.137 --> 02:58:59.838]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:58:59.998 --> 02:59:02.279]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:59:02.299 --> 02:59:07.721]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:59:08.161 --> 02:59:14.444]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:59:14.825 --> 02:59:20.368]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:59:20.828 --> 02:59:24.490]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:59:24.990 --> 02:59:28.952]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:59:29.272 --> 02:59:34.815]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:59:35.215 --> 02:59:38.196]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:59:38.776 --> 02:59:40.177]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:59:40.737 --> 02:59:41.237]  It's here.

[02:59:51.607 --> 02:59:54.470]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.211 --> 02:59:58.414]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:14.494 --> 03:00:18.278]  I'm trying to get to as many of your calls as I can here with Lindsey Williams.
[03:00:18.318 --> 03:00:25.106]  Lindsey, before I forget, ProficyClub.com to get the Middle East, the rest of the story, 3 DVD set.
[03:00:25.686 --> 03:00:28.790]  But also, what's that number one more time for folks that don't have it?
[03:00:29.522 --> 03:00:29.942]  We're good.
[03:00:52.850 --> 03:00:54.551]  Folks should get it and get it out to everybody.
[03:00:54.591 --> 03:00:56.232]  Let's jam in a few final calls here.
[03:00:56.632 --> 03:00:59.553]  John in Texas, you're on the air with Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[03:00:59.593 --> 03:01:00.034]  Go ahead.
[03:01:00.054 --> 03:01:02.235]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:01:02.955 --> 03:01:05.336]  Oh, just sitting here, you know, tracking the Globalist.
[03:01:05.356 --> 03:01:06.016]  What's on your mind?
[03:01:06.036 --> 03:01:07.857]  That's a good thing.
[03:01:08.918 --> 03:01:19.183]  I just want to comment and just on what's being talked about and something I found out and was very interesting is that there's a person here locally
[03:01:20.054 --> 03:01:25.857]  That has a friend that lives in China, the country of China, and he's like a trends forecaster.
[03:01:25.897 --> 03:01:27.418]  He's like a Gerald Cilente.
[03:01:27.578 --> 03:01:28.759]  Okay, what's he saying?
[03:01:29.599 --> 03:01:40.826]  He's saying he's crunching the numbers, he's doing his analysis, and what he's telling this person here locally that things are going to start to come unraveled here in August.
[03:01:42.165 --> 03:01:44.186]  So it's just a word to the wise and Lindsey.
[03:01:44.586 --> 03:01:54.010]  I know you said before in the past, get your family ready, get your food ready, get your water, gas, probably, you know, pull money out of an ATM, get it out of the bank, you know, before things do get bad.
[03:01:54.510 --> 03:01:58.492]  But that's the information that we're getting from this man in China.
[03:01:58.512 --> 03:02:01.793]  And he said that things will start to come unraveled here in August.
[03:02:01.873 --> 03:02:03.134]  So I want to just throw that out.
[03:02:03.174 --> 03:02:05.355]  And that's just we're talking five, five and a half months.
[03:02:05.635 --> 03:02:10.558]  Well, notice they've been telling us that the recovery's been great in the last two years, even though we're in a depression.
[03:02:11.839 --> 03:02:15.281]  And now they're telling us, oh, the Arabs, it's going to cause a meltdown.
[03:02:15.301 --> 03:02:16.521]  Appreciate your call, John.
[03:02:17.342 --> 03:02:18.983]  Any comments on what John said, Lindsey?
[03:02:19.597 --> 03:02:23.980]  I was given these exact words, and I'll quote them word for word, verbatim.
[03:02:24.100 --> 03:02:26.602]  I said it on Alex Jones Show about two years ago.
[03:02:26.622 --> 03:02:30.984]  He said to me, he said, China is the big one.
[03:02:31.104 --> 03:02:32.966]  Alex, you'll remember me saying that on your show.
[03:02:33.306 --> 03:02:42.692]  He went on to explain what's going to happen with China, how the Daddy Bush brought them out from the closed society of many years ago, and they moved our industry abroad.
[03:02:43.012 --> 03:02:46.134]  And he used the expression and went on to explain to me what's going to happen.
[03:02:46.434 --> 03:02:48.476]  China is the big one, Alex.
[03:02:49.449 --> 03:02:50.030]  Absolutely.
[03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:51.911]  Let's try to jam in some more calls here.
[03:02:51.971 --> 03:02:53.493]  Let's talk to Jack in Michigan.
[03:02:53.513 --> 03:02:55.194]  You're on the air with Pastor Lindsey Williams.
[03:02:56.275 --> 03:02:57.456]  Yes, Pastor Williams.
[03:02:57.556 --> 03:03:08.245]  I did read your book, The Energy Non-Crisis, and my question is, which government agency told the Alaska Pipeline to only build two pipelines instead of 12?
[03:03:08.425 --> 03:03:10.307]  That's my first question.
[03:03:11.108 --> 03:03:14.050]  And the second one is the
[03:03:16.408 --> 03:03:19.095]  You wrote another book called Where is the Food?
[03:03:19.958 --> 03:03:20.639]  Your first book.
[03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:21.522]  Can you get this?
[03:03:21.562 --> 03:03:23.266]  There's still a copy of that book somewhere.
[03:03:24.824 --> 03:03:25.665]  No, it's out of print.
[03:03:25.845 --> 03:03:27.586]  All of those books are presently out of print.
[03:03:27.626 --> 03:03:29.087]  Let me answer your question.
[03:03:29.107 --> 03:03:32.328]  First of all, one day I was with one of these elitists.
[03:03:32.368 --> 03:03:35.891]  We spent quite some time together that day, riding around the North Slope.
[03:03:36.411 --> 03:03:40.573]  And I asked him, I said, look at all these ecologists out here.
[03:03:41.814 --> 03:03:45.556]  They're costing you thousands of dollars trying to produce this pipeline.
[03:03:45.896 --> 03:03:52.380]  I said, I understand that you actually give money to support them, the Sierra Club and Greenpeace and all the rest of them.
[03:03:52.420 --> 03:03:53.221]  He said, Chaplain,
[03:03:53.941 --> 03:03:59.645]  We give to the Democratic Party, we give to the Republican Party, we give to Greenpeace, we give to Syrica.
[03:03:59.785 --> 03:04:02.767]  He said we give every one of them, big amounts every year.
[03:04:02.787 --> 03:04:09.991]  He said we do it because regardless of who gets in, Democrats or Republicans, we can control the whole thing on either side.
[03:04:10.311 --> 03:04:13.333]  Now, you say, who did what they did that day?
[03:04:13.413 --> 03:04:14.274]  I'll tell you who did it.
[03:04:14.854 --> 03:04:21.985]  The oil companies wanted to see to it that oil was not given to the American people until they took it to $200 a barrel.
[03:04:22.085 --> 03:04:30.698]  Now the oil companies did it and the government backs it up with the fake environmental movements that are paid for by the oil companies on record to shut down their competition.
[03:04:32.376 --> 03:04:45.099]  I was utterly amazed when this man told me how they do these things, because remember, I've been a pastor for 12 years, I was brought up in a wonderful, godly home, and all of a sudden to hear people talk about supporting both sides so they can totally control them?
[03:04:45.459 --> 03:04:51.221]  Well, all they did was, they have backed the president in the previous election.
[03:04:51.261 --> 03:04:52.021]  That's what they did.
[03:04:52.061 --> 03:04:54.041]  Lindsey, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:04:54.662 --> 03:04:56.682]  We're going to talk to you again very, very soon.
[03:04:57.002 --> 03:04:57.602]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:57.622 --> 03:04:59.763]  We're going to come back with Aaron Dyche with a special report.
[03:05:00.834 --> 03:05:04.856]  For centuries, silver has been used as a powerful natural antibiotic.
[03:05:04.876 --> 03:05:09.839]  And as a listener to this station, you probably already know the benefits of using colloidal silver.
[03:05:10.039 --> 03:05:17.323]  With so many websites to choose from, finding a reputable patriotic company with great products at affordable prices can be a difficult task.

[03:05:48.627 --> 03:05:51.769]  Taking back America's healthcare, one American at a time.
[03:06:00.635 --> 03:06:02.977]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:06:03.017 --> 03:06:05.218]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:06:05.238 --> 03:06:08.140]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:13.323]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:06:13.663 --> 03:06:17.846]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:06:18.166 --> 03:06:20.507]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:06:20.527 --> 03:06:23.028]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:06:23.048 --> 03:06:25.969]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:06:26.310 --> 03:06:33.913]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:06:34.252 --> 03:06:39.513]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:06:39.633 --> 03:06:41.914]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:06:41.954 --> 03:06:45.934]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:06:46.174 --> 03:06:47.095]  And I got news for you.
[03:06:47.255 --> 03:06:48.555]  You're everyone else.
[03:06:48.575 --> 03:06:49.575]  Invisible Empire.

[03:06:59.497 --> 03:07:02.658]  There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:07:03.018 --> 03:07:13.422]  Both a veterinarian and naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide?
[03:07:13.802 --> 03:07:26.307]  He believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of their life, and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition, not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side effects
[03:07:26.607 --> 03:07:28.229]  This is clearly a deadly recipe.
[03:07:28.589 --> 03:07:37.859]  The good news is Doc Wallach's message is resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and big pharma manipulation of our healthcare system.
[03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:45.448]  I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to enlighten people about healthcare and have joined forces to help this tireless crusader spread his message.
[03:07:45.908 --> 03:07:50.472]  Visit InfoWarsTeam.com and listen to Dr. Wallach's Deadly Recipes Lecture.
[03:07:50.772 --> 03:07:54.516]  It makes a lot of sense, and I want you to join our InfoWars Team.
[03:07:54.716 --> 03:07:56.718]  Go to InfoWarsTeam.com.

[03:08:00.701 --> 03:08:05.805]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:06.126 --> 03:08:08.408]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:14.758 --> 03:08:18.000]  Alright, we're live into overdrive, into the fourth hour.
[03:08:18.121 --> 03:08:22.384]  It is the ninth day on this Wednesday of March 2011.
[03:08:22.904 --> 03:08:25.526]  Aaron Dykes is with us here.
[03:08:26.327 --> 03:08:40.357]  You know, a few months ago, during the big ice storms and the power outages, the White House responded to us on WhiteHouse.gov, the communications director, and said we were liars, that Obama hadn't shut down any power plants.
[03:08:40.397 --> 03:08:41.958]  So we made a video and wrote articles.
[03:08:42.939 --> 03:08:47.462]  Showing they'd shut dozens and dozens down around the country and, quote, plan to shut down thousands.
[03:08:48.803 --> 03:08:53.066]  But again, they think their audience is a bunch of idiots, a bunch of morons, and I guess some of them are.
[03:08:53.086 --> 03:08:54.287]  I mean, they'd believe anything.
[03:08:54.307 --> 03:08:56.869]  They could tell people jump off a cliff and they'd do it if the government told them.
[03:08:56.889 --> 03:08:57.709]  These are cult members.
[03:08:57.729 --> 03:08:59.210]  It's like Jim Jones followers.
[03:09:00.391 --> 03:09:05.074]  But these people, you know, even those that are attacking them say, oh, they're environmental wackos.
[03:09:05.615 --> 03:09:07.356]  They, you know, they think they're saving the earth.
[03:09:07.436 --> 03:09:07.977]  No, they don't.
[03:09:08.737 --> 03:09:15.821]  These people are invested in biotech companies openly planning cross-species genetic engineered stuff that actually is endangering the planet.
[03:09:16.302 --> 03:09:18.483]  These people are developing all sorts of weapons systems.
[03:09:18.503 --> 03:09:19.244]  They could care less.
[03:09:19.564 --> 03:09:25.307]  They guilt you into letting them take over markets and industries to vertically integrate it.
[03:09:25.327 --> 03:09:27.269]  And then they use it as a tool of control.
[03:09:27.309 --> 03:09:28.169]  This is feudalism.
[03:09:28.569 --> 03:09:29.310]  This is serfdom.
[03:09:30.553 --> 03:09:32.174]  And, you know, now it's in the news.
[03:09:32.274 --> 03:09:35.395]  Well, you know what, I'm going to give Aaron Dykes to give us this report, the floor.
[03:09:35.976 --> 03:09:43.219]  But every day or two I see, you know, Reuters, Soros, Albright invest $250 million, and the government's helping fund them.
[03:09:44.160 --> 03:09:47.301]  And they're setting up, you know, power plants in the U.S.
[03:09:47.801 --> 03:09:51.423]  The head of GE gets a waiver on their new power plants.
[03:09:51.443 --> 03:09:53.084]  He's the head of the Economic Commission.
[03:09:54.127 --> 03:09:55.148]  The President's Council.
[03:09:55.828 --> 03:10:00.152]  Just like 1,040 of the insider companies like McDonald's.
[03:10:00.492 --> 03:10:03.855]  They don't have to get health insurance, but this year I've got to start getting it.
[03:10:05.016 --> 03:10:06.157]  But their companies don't.
[03:10:06.237 --> 03:10:08.658]  I mean, it's just pure brazen discrimination.
[03:10:08.939 --> 03:10:11.281]  But we only think of discrimination black versus white.
[03:10:11.981 --> 03:10:17.886]  Not, insiders don't have to pay the taxes, but the local farm has to shut down.
[03:10:19.247 --> 03:10:26.850]  I mean, but people are running around, I'm a woman, I'm a man, I'm black, I'm white, and they have us all fight with each other.
[03:10:27.310 --> 03:10:30.131]  Meanwhile, the globalists are a bunch of slimy crooks.
[03:10:30.612 --> 03:10:36.754]  So I want to go over the history of the carbon taxes, the sustainability councils, and who they really are.
[03:10:37.194 --> 03:10:41.056]  They are literally a mafia, a knuckle-dragging mafia.
[03:10:41.856 --> 03:10:43.317]  Let's go over it, Aaron Dykes.
[03:10:43.897 --> 03:10:52.261]  Yeah, Alex, you're absolutely right to bring up the shutdown of the coal plants from back in February, which they denied, but which was happening right here in Texas.
[03:10:53.142 --> 03:10:54.582]  And we're the largest coal supplier.
[03:10:54.622 --> 03:10:56.223]  We supply to many other states.
[03:10:56.664 --> 03:11:03.187]  And it's just like a week and a half ago or whatever it was, where they said the era of having on-demand electricity is over.
[03:11:03.647 --> 03:11:05.968]  And you know, people talked about how now we're North Korea.
[03:11:06.268 --> 03:11:10.070]  That's because they only allow their people, at most, two hours of power a day.
[03:11:10.590 --> 03:11:12.071]  Well, they're starving their people.
[03:11:12.411 --> 03:11:18.114]  They're starving us in a Neo-Malthusian agenda, which is directly tied to Agenda 21.
[03:11:18.654 --> 03:11:31.340]  And this all started in a concentrated fashion right after the first Bush agreed to the Agenda 21, and then Bill Clinton immediately started the Council for Sustainable Development.
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:37.686]  And that was the announcement in 92 in Rio by Maurice Strong about the post-industrial world.
[03:11:37.966 --> 03:11:39.448]  I mean, this is their stated goal.
[03:11:39.948 --> 03:11:50.939]  And that was a framework for a whole new society where consumption is over, the Judeo-Christian West is supposedly over, and it's all about this micromanagement by these globalists.
[03:11:51.460 --> 03:11:52.661]  And yeah, Bill Clinton in 1993
[03:11:54.222 --> 03:12:03.064]  Issued the Agenda 21 through executive order number 12852 directly setting up the Council for Sustainable Development.
[03:12:03.604 --> 03:12:13.346]  And it's just amazing because you see directly right there the nexus between these energy giants and the supposed environmental people concerned supposedly about the earth.
[03:12:13.766 --> 03:12:21.088]  We're in bed together from the beginning in this Agenda 21 Council set up by Bill Clinton and of course continued through the president.
[03:12:21.108 --> 03:12:22.948]  And not about saving whales, continue.
[03:12:23.628 --> 03:12:29.276]  And it has nothing to do with Obama being supposedly a socialist because this has been obviously left right all along.
[03:12:29.676 --> 03:12:31.358]  Those terms are all distraction.
[03:12:31.378 --> 03:12:41.632]  These are pirates using government to consolidate power and using gaggles of well-meaning socialists who are dependents as political weapons to take over the rest of the economy.
[03:12:42.389 --> 03:12:46.353]  Yeah, because Enron was known for being in bed with the Bush administration and all that.
[03:12:46.733 --> 03:12:50.016]  But they were in bed with the Clinton administration long before that.
[03:12:50.397 --> 03:12:56.683]  And before they came up with trading carbon dioxide, they were already taxing and trading on sulfur dioxide.
[03:12:57.223 --> 03:12:58.985]  So they've been in this game for a long time.
[03:12:59.705 --> 03:13:05.391]  But it's important to note that on that council for sustainable development was Ken Lay.
[03:13:05.991 --> 03:13:12.339]  Uh, was a number of the leading environmental agencies and other people from Enron and other energy companies.
[03:13:12.979 --> 03:13:14.802]  And they have just been a part of this whole thing.
[03:13:15.482 --> 03:13:21.730]  And... Guys, while he's going over these documents, uh, just scoon in and pan back and forth so folks can see that over there.
[03:13:22.090 --> 03:13:23.352]  Just scoon in over there.
[03:13:23.412 --> 03:13:23.872]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:13:23.912 --> 03:13:24.172]  Thank you.
[03:13:24.192 --> 03:13:24.413]  Go ahead.
[03:13:24.753 --> 03:13:33.518]  Now again, that Council for Sustainable Development set up by Clinton in 93, of course, really came to a head around 97 with the Kyoto Protocol.
[03:13:33.918 --> 03:13:42.643]  And you have not only Ken Lay of Enron, but also John Palmisano of Enron, who was their environmental guy.
[03:13:42.663 --> 03:13:46.865]  He put out this memo, which is known among researchers anyway,
[03:13:47.305 --> 03:13:53.008]  We'll cover this in 1997 saying this Kyoto stuff, this cap-and-trade stuff is a win.
[03:13:53.268 --> 03:13:58.150]  It's winning, winning, winning for Enron and anyone who wants to trade this stuff.
[03:13:58.710 --> 03:14:03.333]  Let me read a couple excerpts from that memo from John Palmisano of Enron.
[03:14:03.773 --> 03:14:12.277]  If implemented, this agreement would do more to promote Enron's business than will almost any other regulatory initiative outside of restructuring of the energy
[03:14:12.577 --> 03:14:12.717]  I think?
[03:14:31.797 --> 03:14:33.098]  Sorry, I'm just referencing that.
[03:14:33.398 --> 03:14:37.481]  The Clean Development Fund will be a mechanism for funding renewable projects again.
[03:14:37.961 --> 03:14:39.942]  We, this being Enron, won.
[03:14:40.302 --> 03:14:43.464]  The endorsement of admissions training was another victory for us.
[03:14:43.945 --> 03:14:54.071]  So you see, Enron was very excited at the implementation of Cap-It-Trade because, of course, they helped design the system under the Council for Sustainable Development.
[03:14:54.851 --> 03:15:06.021]  Uh, and you also see a parallel, uh, because of course this is a military-industrial complex, not only of government, not only of business, uh, but of these non-profit groups, of the environmental sector.
[03:15:06.482 --> 03:15:18.793]  Now the John Hines Three Center, which is run by, uh, John Hines is the late Skull and Bones member, uh, Teresa Hines Carey, uh, was his wife, now married to John Carey, also Skull and Bones.
[03:15:19.373 --> 03:15:45.198]  And that center wrote this report in 1998, Designs for Domestic Carbon Emissions Trading, and you see in their members a good half of the staff of the Council on Sustainable Development, including Ken Lay, including John Palmesamo, also both of Enron, and you also see Alcoa in that group, you also see the Environmental Defense Fund, who are very important, you see S.C.
[03:15:45.238 --> 03:15:45.718]  Johnson and
[03:15:45.998 --> 03:15:51.762]  So it's the big insiders with a gaggle of environmental groups shutting down all their competition.
[03:15:52.442 --> 03:16:02.788]  Yeah, that's it, because as we discussed yesterday, Enron completely used the deregulated energy market in California in the early 2000s to just make a killing.
[03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:06.691]  And there's been some new indictments dealing with carbon tax pump and dump.
[03:16:07.202 --> 03:16:08.202]  Yeah, I have that here.
[03:16:08.643 --> 03:16:09.963]  I don't want to jump around too much.
[03:16:10.163 --> 03:16:11.064]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:16:11.144 --> 03:16:20.127]  No, no, no, I just, February 18th, this was only a few weeks ago, 2011, SEC charges 7 people in a global warming pump and dump scheme.
[03:16:20.727 --> 03:16:26.850]  So just like Enron was always part of those pump and dump schemes, here we have people involved in the global warming trading.
[03:16:27.470 --> 03:16:28.550]  Part of the pump-and-dump scheme.
[03:16:29.211 --> 03:16:40.335]  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a group of seven individuals who perpetrated a fraudulent pump-and-dump scheme in the stock of a sham company purported to provide products and services to fight global warming.
[03:16:40.855 --> 03:16:47.717]  When you get into the details, you see that they were not only part of this global warming trading, but they were of course laundering money across several countries.
[03:16:48.498 --> 03:16:49.738]  Oh, they're good people.
[03:16:50.078 --> 03:16:51.759]  Alright, let's continue with the friendliness.
[03:16:52.861 --> 03:17:01.085]  Well, look, going back to the President's Council on Sustainable Development is a real powerhouse of business, but also of these supposed environmental groups.
[03:17:01.505 --> 03:17:07.248]  And one of the most important members is Fred Krupp, who's part of the Environmental Defense Fund.
[03:17:07.648 --> 03:17:13.731]  And you see, when we look at what happened in Texas with the coal plants and why they were shut down for cap-and-trade reasons.
[03:17:13.751 --> 03:17:16.853]  That was right after the Bilderberg Group meeting that Perry was at.
[03:17:17.540 --> 03:17:18.242]  Yeah, that's right.
[03:17:18.703 --> 03:17:24.017]  And I started tracking it because I was tracking Bilderberg, I was tracking Perry, I was tracking the toll roads.
[03:17:24.098 --> 03:17:26.163]  And even back then you said this is about power plants.
[03:17:26.693 --> 03:17:28.955]  Yeah, because they were all about this TXU.
[03:17:28.995 --> 03:17:31.778]  They were going to build 11 new coal power plants in Texas.
[03:17:32.178 --> 03:17:38.424]  They cut that down to eight because of this group that I'm talking about, including Fred Krupp of the Environmental Defense Fund.
[03:17:38.784 --> 03:17:49.093]  And I knew it was going on because Goldman Sachs and KKR, Kravis, one of the Biddleberg members, they were all over it like flies on you-know-what.
[03:17:50.174 --> 03:17:51.896]  But I went back to that report
[03:17:52.476 --> 03:18:04.752]  Uh, as to what happened with the TXU buyout, to try to understand why the coal plants were shut down today, and here's this article from 2007, TXU buyout, anatomy of a deal, and who was involved in the environmental...
[03:18:05.692 --> 03:18:07.073]  It's the Environmental Defense Fund.
[03:18:07.093 --> 03:18:15.280]  This Fred Krupp was at the meeting of the Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts, and Goldman Sachs, and Texas Pacific Group buyout.
[03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:21.685]  It was touted as the biggest buyout of all time, a $45 billion buyout, then cut to $32 billion.
[03:18:21.965 --> 03:18:28.510]  And part of that deal was them agreeing to implement cap-and-trade and join the U.S.
[03:18:28.570 --> 03:18:30.572]  CAP, which is the Climate Action Program.
[03:18:31.192 --> 03:18:43.316]  They voluntarily joined it in 2007 before Obama could do anything about it, and they agreed to cut their emissions, and they agreed to cut back their 11 power plants to only, I believe, three, or at least that's what they said.
[03:18:43.336 --> 03:18:50.399]  And they also come in and lobby to buy up city-owned utilities like the old power plant, Holly Street, that supplied much of the city.
[03:18:51.079 --> 03:18:53.520]  And they could retrofit it, make it totally clean.
[03:18:53.560 --> 03:18:54.420]  They don't want that.
[03:18:54.840 --> 03:18:59.202]  They'd rather give you one hour of power a day and charge you for a week's worth of it.
[03:18:59.742 --> 03:19:02.004]  I mean, they admit it's about controlling us.
[03:19:02.224 --> 03:19:03.165]  That's exactly it.
[03:19:03.305 --> 03:19:11.351]  It's profits in the short term, and in the long term, it's Agenda 21, sustainable development, you know, neo-Malthusian, starving our consumer.
[03:19:11.371 --> 03:19:20.918]  Because they don't only want to cut our population numbers and depopulate us, as you know, but they also want to cut back our Western culture consumerism because
[03:19:21.138 --> 03:19:28.287]  And this was a trap, because they built the infrastructure where we're dependent on it, where we're not classically, you know, sustainable.
[03:19:28.487 --> 03:19:31.631]  They always create a counterfeit of that, and now they want to strangle us.
[03:19:32.796 --> 03:19:36.159]  Well, let's come back in this next segment and go over the rest of it.
[03:19:36.179 --> 03:19:37.280]  This is very, very important.
[03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:40.002]  Aaron Dykes in here with us right now, live.
[03:19:40.042 --> 03:19:40.762]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:19:41.123 --> 03:19:42.604]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[03:19:42.624 --> 03:19:47.067]  You can also see these articles that Aaron's written at GCNLive.com.
[03:19:47.127 --> 03:19:49.189]  Again, that's GCNLive.com.
[03:19:49.209 --> 03:19:50.530]  We'll continue on the other side.
[03:19:50.970 --> 03:19:57.756]  When you see these local little environmentalists running around saying, shut down power plants, these are dangerous cult members.
[03:19:58.356 --> 03:19:59.017]  Remember that.
[03:19:59.057 --> 03:20:00.138]  And they work for the bankers.
[03:20:02.156 --> 03:20:08.839]  Alex has told you that the Mideast uprisings over food prices and shortages caused by fuel costs are spreading worldwide.
[03:20:09.179 --> 03:20:11.420]  We're seeing the impact right here in the United States.
[03:20:11.861 --> 03:20:17.223]  Ethanol, that was supposed to reduce petroleum use and fuel prices, hit a 30-month high in February.
[03:20:17.523 --> 03:20:20.665]  And pump prices are expected to reach $5 a gallon.
[03:20:20.905 --> 03:20:27.508]  Because of shipping costs, food is being priced out of the reach of millions of Americans, with an expected 35% jump in the next 60 days.
[03:20:27.528 --> 03:20:27.808]  Move quickly!
[03:20:29.889 --> 03:20:33.991]  Well, you can still afford it, and eFoods Direct will pay your shipping costs for you.

[03:21:00.996 --> 03:21:05.140]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[03:21:05.200 --> 03:21:06.461]  dollar has been devaluating.
[03:21:06.621 --> 03:21:10.345]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[03:21:10.625 --> 03:21:13.167]  Is there a way to protect your portfolios from losing value?
[03:21:13.367 --> 03:21:15.169]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[03:21:15.349 --> 03:21:17.651]  They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[03:21:18.672 --> 03:21:27.397]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them until now, your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800.
[03:21:27.437 --> 03:21:30.879]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[03:21:30.939 --> 03:21:34.021]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.

[03:21:44.310 --> 03:21:45.390]  America, you've been warned.
[03:22:05.247 --> 03:22:05.527]  I don't know.
[03:22:35.307 --> 03:22:35.667]  I think so.
[03:23:00.396 --> 03:23:06.581]  This message starts with a great offer from Big Berkey Water Filters, because we don't want you drinking dangerous water one minute longer.

[03:24:00.836 --> 03:24:05.497]  Federal agents, we are armed!
[03:24:05.517 --> 03:24:10.939]  Notice, all of a sudden, all Hades breaks loose in the Middle East and North Africa.
[03:24:10.979 --> 03:24:16.660]  Here are some of the headlines at InfoWars.com, PrisonBlinded.com, and also up on DrugsReport.com.
[03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:19.361]  Oil markets brace for Saudi rage.
[03:24:21.201 --> 03:24:22.842]  Spare capacity thins.
[03:24:23.042 --> 03:24:26.285]  Attack on Iraq pipeline halts oil exports.
[03:24:26.785 --> 03:24:29.787]  Almost all oil has halted coming out of Libya.
[03:24:30.127 --> 03:24:33.730]  Qaddafi forces hit oil facilities in central Libya.
[03:24:34.090 --> 03:24:35.451]  Violence flares in Egypt.
[03:24:35.511 --> 03:24:36.452]  Thirteen killed.
[03:24:38.359 --> 03:24:41.060]  Gaddafi holds in his fight.
[03:24:42.940 --> 03:24:47.622]  Again, there's too much energy, too much resources, too many factories, too much wealth.
[03:24:48.062 --> 03:24:50.883]  The globalist system is all about artificial scarcity.
[03:24:51.203 --> 03:24:53.103]  Diamonds are in the semi-precious range.
[03:24:53.823 --> 03:24:59.025]  But people will pay a year's salary for the engagement for a piece of clear carbon.
[03:25:00.407 --> 03:25:04.730]  You know, like a bird that collects shiny things, instead of real wealth.
[03:25:05.170 --> 03:25:09.253]  Because the woman is told, and the culture is told, you must have this.
[03:25:10.374 --> 03:25:11.214]  And it's the same thing.
[03:25:11.594 --> 03:25:12.695]  You must be trendy.
[03:25:13.055 --> 03:25:14.336]  You must go along with this.
[03:25:14.396 --> 03:25:16.378]  You must pay for carbon.
[03:25:16.398 --> 03:25:19.840]  Oh my gosh, the carbon dioxide's killing the trees!
[03:25:20.300 --> 03:25:21.441]  It's killing them!
[03:25:22.021 --> 03:25:24.523]  Ban dihydrogen monoxide!
[03:25:24.623 --> 03:25:27.285]  Almost everybody at these environmental events, they've done it over and over again.
[03:25:27.305 --> 03:25:27.565]  Test.
[03:25:27.825 --> 03:25:28.406]  We'll sign it.
[03:25:28.526 --> 03:25:28.886]  Ban it.
[03:25:28.926 --> 03:25:29.927]  Dihydrogen monoxide.
[03:25:29.947 --> 03:25:30.347]  Sounds scary.
[03:25:30.447 --> 03:25:30.909]  It's water.
[03:25:31.551 --> 03:25:32.795]  Banned sodium chloride.
[03:25:32.835 --> 03:25:33.237]  It's salt.
[03:25:34.255 --> 03:25:55.980]  And they just run around, just... Meanwhile, big, vicious, globalist operators, who love tyranny, who love working with dictators worldwide, who are helping the Chinese put in their control grid, GE and others, Soros, who helped the Nazis round people up, and even has Jewish groups he runs, attack Glenn Beck and say it's wrong to mention he helped the Nazis.
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:25:59.461]  They don't even deny it's wrong, they just... I mean, they don't even deny that he did it.
[03:25:59.721 --> 03:26:01.461]  They just say it's wrong to even talk about it.
[03:26:02.313 --> 03:26:05.295]  I mean, it's just, and he's called a philanthropist.
[03:26:06.116 --> 03:26:06.836]  And it's simple.
[03:26:06.896 --> 03:26:10.158]  They shut down all their competition and give you one hour of power a day.
[03:26:10.599 --> 03:26:16.002]  And Soros is in the news today on PrisonPlanet.com saying freedom isn't good.
[03:26:16.342 --> 03:26:17.723]  He wants Chinese tyranny.
[03:26:18.284 --> 03:26:23.347]  These are, people are like, NPR and all them are like, whoa, yes, because you're not liberals.
[03:26:23.707 --> 03:26:31.993]  You're horrible, chicken-necked, fake intellectual, wicked 21st century Nazis who were so evil, you don't even know what you are.
[03:26:33.353 --> 03:26:34.754]  Aaron Dykes, we got three minutes left.
[03:26:34.794 --> 03:26:38.115]  Break down the rest of their sickening seizure of our energy infrastructure.
[03:26:38.416 --> 03:26:58.464]  Let me take you back just a little more over a year ago to February 2010, before they decided to implement the cap-and-trade under the EPA, when they were still trying to pass the Senate bill, and they remarked that a climate bill, and this is in Reuters, was getting a last big push from an unlikely ally, a group of energy companies, including General Electric, Duke, and Shell Oil.
[03:26:59.304 --> 03:26:59.484]  Why?
[03:26:59.524 --> 03:27:03.127]  Because they were lobbying with the environmentalists under the U.S.
[03:27:03.167 --> 03:27:05.188]  Climate Action Partnership.
[03:27:05.228 --> 03:27:13.093]  Their idea was to implement cap-and-trade first on power utilities and then later on oil refineries and other industries.
[03:27:13.433 --> 03:27:16.596]  And we have this... Because they all get the waivers but the little guys don't.
[03:27:16.916 --> 03:27:26.462]  Which is in the documents AP got when they sued in 2000 from 96 where the big oil companies got together and said shut down all the little oil companies and refineries.
[03:27:26.722 --> 03:27:28.684]  That way the glut of oil can't come to market.
[03:27:28.744 --> 03:27:29.224]  Sorry go ahead.
[03:27:29.524 --> 03:27:30.184]  No, no, no.
[03:27:30.224 --> 03:27:32.985]  It's exactly on point because with Cap-and-Trade, you have Enron.
[03:27:33.005 --> 03:27:35.445]  You just don't care about the bunny rabbits!
[03:27:36.085 --> 03:27:44.007]  Well, Enron and Goldman Sachs helped write this bill because they knew if you outlaw carbon, the price on it goes up, up, up for those credits indefinitely.
[03:27:44.067 --> 03:27:45.207]  It's guaranteed profit.
[03:27:45.547 --> 03:27:47.447]  But the yuppies like being conned, Aaron.
[03:27:47.707 --> 03:27:54.569]  I mean, what would happen if you outlawed drugs but you had a limited supply only for the most indulgent drug users to bid up on?
[03:27:54.629 --> 03:27:55.329]  That's what they've done!
[03:27:56.549 --> 03:27:59.211]  That's what the war in Mexico is about, boosting cash.
[03:27:59.271 --> 03:28:07.677]  And you see a parallel directly to the way they use the derivatives market in California to instill rolling blackouts and drive those prices way, way up.
[03:28:07.717 --> 03:28:08.898]  By the way, you have that clip.
[03:28:08.918 --> 03:28:09.558]  Let's play that.
[03:28:09.999 --> 03:28:10.799]  Tell folks about this clip.
[03:28:10.859 --> 03:28:16.523]  In 30 seconds, you have actual audio tape of Enron traders calling up the power plants, telling them to shut down.
[03:28:16.603 --> 03:28:17.224]  Roll it, please.
[03:28:18.104 --> 03:28:26.674]  Traders soon discovered that by shutting down power plants, they could create artificial shortages that would push prices even higher.
[03:28:30.763 --> 03:28:31.544]  David up in Enron?
[03:28:31.764 --> 03:28:32.024]  Uh-huh.
[03:28:32.864 --> 03:28:34.845]  There's not much demand for power at all.
[03:28:34.965 --> 03:28:38.047]  If we shut it down, could you bring it back up in three or four hours?
[03:28:38.067 --> 03:28:38.887]  Oh yeah.
[03:28:39.187 --> 03:28:41.208]  Why don't you just go ahead and shut her down then, if that's okay?
[03:28:41.609 --> 03:28:43.930]  We want you guys to get a little creative.
[03:28:44.130 --> 03:28:44.430]  Okay.
[03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:45.951]  And come up with a reason to go down.
[03:28:46.151 --> 03:28:47.491]  Like a forced outage type thing?
[03:28:47.912 --> 03:28:48.112]  Right.
[03:28:48.712 --> 03:28:56.253]  Those guys, at the flip of a switch, could just yank the California economy on its leash whenever they wanted to, and they did it, and they did it, and they did it.
[03:28:56.293 --> 03:28:57.153]  Okay, so what?
[03:28:57.173 --> 03:29:01.334]  Now, Obama, they claimed that 50 plants malfunctioned.
[03:29:01.374 --> 03:29:02.234]  Turned out they didn't.
[03:29:02.594 --> 03:29:04.015]  Turns out they couldn't supply it.
[03:29:04.075 --> 03:29:07.495]  Some of the insiders did shut down power, and they made a few extra bill.
[03:29:07.855 --> 03:29:09.936]  Same thing was being done every day in California.
[03:29:10.696 --> 03:29:13.416]  Can the public figure this out when it's stated by them?
[03:29:13.436 --> 03:29:17.337]  I guess it would be untrendy to actually not be conned.
[03:29:17.637 --> 03:29:27.063]  The whole worldwide power market, the conventional power market, is only a couple hundred billion, but they figure under this carbon paradigm, it's a guaranteed trillion, maybe more, per year.
[03:29:28.124 --> 03:29:30.485]  While they kill the conventional real economy?
[03:29:30.906 --> 03:29:39.972]  Yeah, because they want to shut us down, de-industrialize us, according to Agenda 21, but they let these select businesses... And then that allows the paper market to come in and buy up what's left?
[03:29:40.757 --> 03:29:41.478]  It's amazing, right?
[03:29:41.498 --> 03:29:43.321]  Aaron, incredible job on this report.
[03:29:43.401 --> 03:29:46.826]  Hope all you trendies check out everything we said and save yourselves.
[03:29:47.126 --> 03:29:49.490]  Or if you like being raped, knock yourselves out.
[03:29:50.972 --> 03:29:51.873]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.374 --> 03:29:53.876]  The Empire's on the run.
