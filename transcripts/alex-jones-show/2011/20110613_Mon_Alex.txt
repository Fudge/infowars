[00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:01.471]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:03.332]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:03.993 --> 00:00:04.794]  You want answers?
[00:00:05.575 --> 00:00:06.476]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:10.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:15.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:21.944]  I've got a lot on my mind.
[00:00:21.964 --> 00:00:23.445]  I know you've got a lot on your mind.
[00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:26.166]  We've got an important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:26.186 --> 00:00:27.227]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:28.107 --> 00:00:30.549]  It is Monday, the 13th day of June, 2011.
[00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.812]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours today.
[00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:42.735]  Dominique Betting, the member of the Swiss Parliament, who did try to get into Bilderberg, will be joining us.
[00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:46.798]  Of course, a member of the European Union Parliament was beat up
[00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:50.076]  And we've got those reports.
[00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:53.518]  MEP assaulted by Bilderberg security to take legal action.
[00:00:53.538 --> 00:01:00.021]  And that's from the big Swiss national AP equivalent, Swiss Info.
[00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:06.685]  I'm gonna attempt to go over all this news today, and there's a lot of it, but this
[00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:16.392]  Eight years, Bilderberg was extremely historical and got more attention on it than any other Bilderberg group meeting in history.
[00:01:16.912 --> 00:01:23.778]  And people are asking, why are elected, quote, officials meeting with the Fortune 100 in secret, and what are they doing?
[00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:25.059]  Well, we know what they're doing.
[00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:31.584]  They're openly trying, through governments, to rob the wealth of the general population through, quote, bailouts.
[00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:37.469]  They are pushing monopoly capitalism or fascism, the opposite of the free market.
[00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:46.554]  And I've made a film, of course, in-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, detailing many of their admitted crimes, many of their own minutes, many of their own books they've written.
[00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:51.117]  Bilderberg Group members write books and brag about how they're setting up world government.
[00:01:52.698 --> 00:01:56.100]  And it's very exciting to go from the point of being made fun of
[00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:06.034]  A decade ago or more, if you talked about it, to now people knowing that it's a real situation and identifying the actual puppet masters, not the puppets.
[00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:11.357]  Bill Maher talking about it, CNN, Fox News, CNBC, Newsweek.
[00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.439]  They have been forced.
[00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.100]  Associated Press reported on it one hour after the meeting ended.
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.580]  They did leave early.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.701]  They normally leave in the afternoon or even stay over until Monday.
[00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:28.462]  This is the earliest they've ever left, according to Jim Tucker.
[00:02:28.902 --> 00:02:30.842]  Some were helicoptering out by Saturday.
[00:02:30.902 --> 00:02:32.823]  There was a torch-lit procession.
[00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:37.724]  And they said, we're bringing candles to David Rockefeller's birthday.
[00:02:41.184 --> 00:02:52.717]  On midnight June 12th, that would be Saturday into Sunday night, we have video of that marching with their torches, like villagers coming to burn it down, but they were non-violent, it was making a point.
[00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.166]  Really good satire, a political satire in a way, saying, oh we're bringing you a birthday cake and we have these burning
[00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:04.070]  Tip torches as candles for you?
[00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:16.460]  And then the police backed off and weren't holding people back, you know, 300 yards like they were previously after three members of the Swiss Parliament showed up and delivered letters to the police chief and others and said, look, you will allow the demonstrators.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.041]  You will allow the media.
[00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:19.282]  You'll stop harassing people.
[00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:21.023]  We have free speech here.
[00:03:21.904 --> 00:03:28.549]  Uh, and so the police, their body language, it wasn't that oppressive before, but it got very positive after that.
[00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:36.474]  But even I, at the point of watching villagers with their torches, I, I, I, this is some amazing stuff.
[00:03:37.175 --> 00:03:38.175]  This is some amazing stuff.
[00:03:38.195 --> 00:03:42.318]  And we'll, we'll play that video shot by We Are Change Switzerland coming up.
[00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:44.660]  Obviously, I'm not just going to cover, um,
[00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.971]  The whole Bilderberg situation today.
[00:03:49.411 --> 00:03:52.232]  There is just huge economic developments happening.
[00:03:53.612 --> 00:03:56.513]  Massive military developments in the Middle East.
[00:03:57.314 --> 00:04:02.215]  We also have a bizarre, bizarre report out of Texas.
[00:04:03.596 --> 00:04:09.418]  Remember that 60 Minutes piece three or four weeks ago, or a month ago, where they talked about domestic extremists?
[00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:14.325]  And now they're everywhere, and if you don't like the Federal Reserve, you're a terrorist.
[00:04:15.085 --> 00:04:17.826]  Well, here it is, KSAT Television out of Texas.
[00:04:18.307 --> 00:04:23.988]  We have domestic terrorism right here at our doorsteps at Captain Charlie Hicks of the Bandera County Sheriff's Office.
[00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:33.752]  And he went on to say, I have their press release here in my stack, he went on to say that it's terrible, they talk about liberty, they talk about freedom, these are terrorists.
[00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:36.553]  And you think you're reading a piece of satire.
[00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:38.376]  But it's not.
[00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:39.977]  They're doing it with a straight face.
[00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:50.604]  They're now all over the country, the feds are behind the closed doors training police this, but now it's shifting into the open, coming out of the closet that, man, these people are talking about freedom.
[00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.065]  These people are talking about, not liking the new world order.
[00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:53.926]  They're terrorists.
[00:04:54.505 --> 00:04:59.489]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.171]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:08.217]  Let's say you order three of their one-week responder kits.

[00:05:10.019 --> 00:05:12.861]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.142]  Are you kidding me?

[00:05:20.828 --> 00:05:23.831]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.

[00:05:58.351 --> 00:05:59.272]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:59.612 --> 00:06:03.174]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:05.796]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:11.239]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.883]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:23.828]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:24.288 --> 00:06:27.971]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.475]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:38.279]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.682]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:42.263 --> 00:06:43.684]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:44.244 --> 00:06:44.665]  It's here.

[00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:13.026]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:07:15.049 --> 00:07:21.474]  They sow pride in every stitch Guarantee you love the way they fit
[00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.413]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:31.256]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:32.777]  Others don't.
[00:07:33.197 --> 00:07:35.078]  We turn jeans inside out.

[00:07:59.229 --> 00:08:03.450]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.871]  You want answers?
[00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.551]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:10.812]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.393 --> 00:08:15.454]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:33.766 --> 00:08:35.487]  We are live, my friends.
[00:08:35.567 --> 00:08:37.127]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:37.527 --> 00:08:44.730]  It is Monday, the 13th day of June 2011, and we have a lot of important news to talk about.
[00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:53.073]  Obviously, the incredible groundbreaking aftermath of what has been unfolding
[00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:57.099]  With Bilderberg in the last four days.
[00:08:57.439 --> 00:09:12.609]  And I want to go over the highlights of what has developed and also what transpired Saturday evening and Sunday as 125 of the richest and most powerful people met in secret.
[00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:14.770]  And we know what their agenda is.
[00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:16.071]  We have moles inside.
[00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:19.253]  It is the end of the free Internet and free speech as we know it.
[00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:21.235]  It is massive tax increases.
[00:09:21.675 --> 00:09:22.636]  The lion's share of the money
[00:09:23.493 --> 00:09:31.809]  Pay directly through government into private coffers, expanded bailouts, as the thievery is labeled for the public.
[00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:40.063]  Give it some spin-filled name to hide what they're really doing.
[00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:43.244]  We're going to get into what's happening with the stock market.
[00:09:43.904 --> 00:09:49.726]  We're going to cover the election 2012 starting to heat up here in the United States.
[00:09:50.726 --> 00:10:02.670]  Also in Texas, Bandera County, the sheriff is out in the news saying that he's got terrorists, domestic terrorists, in his county ready to strike any minute.
[00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:09.027]  And it turns out it's people that don't like the private Federal Reserve or the Bilderberg Group or support Ron Paul.
[00:10:09.687 --> 00:10:15.433]  And the fact that the police more and more are going public with what the Feds are teaching them behind the scenes.
[00:10:15.493 --> 00:10:23.620]  See, the Feds don't say this publicly because they know it would create a political firestorm and is political demonization and is a fraud.
[00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:29.305]  They're MYAC and Homeland Security Reports and other documents that good police have sent us over the years.
[00:10:30.523 --> 00:10:37.225]  But what happens is local police tend to then go public with what they've been trained in.
[00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:49.528]  Just like pastors three years ago, three years after we broke the news here on the Genesis Radio Network, that secretly Homeland Security and FEMA have recruited now over a hundred thousand preachers.
[00:10:50.168 --> 00:11:02.082]  Think about how creepy and Soviet-style that is, to spy on their flocks, to teach them that guns are bad, and to go to the FEMA Center when you're ordered to, and take your inoculations, Romans 13.
[00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:05.466]  And even though we have those documents with FEMA phone numbers on them,
[00:11:06.007 --> 00:11:18.731]  And the actual training manuals, folks didn't believe it for three years, until on multiple newscasts in Louisiana and in California, local pastors and police went public and said, yes, we do what the government tells us.
[00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:23.612]  It's Romans 13, and during an emergency, take the shots, go where you're told.
[00:11:24.193 --> 00:11:25.733]  We're called the Clergy Response Teams.
[00:11:25.773 --> 00:11:26.613]  We're of the Lord.
[00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:31.855]  So this is the type of system
[00:11:33.223 --> 00:11:34.904]  Guys, I can't reach my coffee and I'm down.
[00:11:34.924 --> 00:11:35.904]  I gotta drive through.
[00:11:35.964 --> 00:11:36.645]  I'll just get it here.
[00:11:39.506 --> 00:11:41.907]  You know, I'm like a prisoner when I'm doing the radio show.
[00:11:41.927 --> 00:11:43.588]  I can't move around in here, but I got it.
[00:11:43.628 --> 00:11:44.288]  I got the coffee.
[00:11:46.329 --> 00:11:53.612]  I am somewhat exhausted from New York today, but I will warm up here as things progress.
[00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:58.875]  We will open the phones up, as I said, but this whole
[00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:13.356]  Bizarro world of saying we've got domestic terrorists in our county, in our city, and having this openly said shows you how far they've gone.
[00:12:14.016 --> 00:12:14.977]  This is what I want to say.
[00:12:18.119 --> 00:12:26.765]  Even... Even if you believe 9-11 was an outside job,
[00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:33.268]  Let's say 19 Arabs from a cave were able to have NORAD stand down.
[00:12:33.308 --> 00:12:43.781]  They did have magic passports, not one but two, that came out of their clothing, through the fireball, through the building, and were then found on the ground within a day by the FBI in all of that bedlam.
[00:12:44.422 --> 00:12:45.203]  If you believe that,
[00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:59.056]  Or you believe that cell phones were working at above 30,000 feet when I, every time I've flown, have snuck and had my wife on the phone or had friends on the phone, and I've never gotten a phone to work above 5,000 feet.
[00:12:59.737 --> 00:13:09.847]  Let's say, magically, the hijackers not using their phones or the passengers not using their phones or the flight attendants not using their phones, that they did work at 15, 20,
[00:13:11.888 --> 00:13:13.990]  25,000, 30,000, 36,000 feet.
[00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:15.671]  If you believe that, great.
[00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:17.073]  Let's just say that's real.
[00:13:17.653 --> 00:13:20.015]  Magically, the laws of physics were suspended that day.
[00:13:20.596 --> 00:13:23.658]  Building 7 fell on its own footprint magically from small fires.
[00:13:24.218 --> 00:13:26.680]  Forget the CNN footage of police saying, get back.
[00:13:27.081 --> 00:13:28.202]  They're going to bring down Building 7.
[00:13:28.542 --> 00:13:29.823]  That building's about to blow up.
[00:13:30.283 --> 00:13:31.725]  And there was a 10-second countdown.
[00:13:32.405 --> 00:13:34.407]  And it was announced on the news they were going to blow it up.
[00:13:34.827 --> 00:13:35.227]  I heard it.
[00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:36.028]  I've seen it.
[00:13:36.068 --> 00:13:37.169]  We've got the newscast.
[00:13:37.469 --> 00:13:38.150]  We've played them.
[00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.411]  They're going to bring down Building 7.
[00:13:40.272 --> 00:13:41.793]  New Yorkers all heard it as well.
[00:13:42.433 --> 00:13:43.614]  Let's just forget all of that.
[00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:45.296]  Let's just say it's real.
[00:13:46.097 --> 00:13:46.497]  Okay?
[00:13:46.537 --> 00:13:49.459]  Bin Laden wasn't a CIA asset, even though on record he was.
[00:13:49.479 --> 00:13:56.005]  And let's just go along and say it was real for the sake of argument today.
[00:13:57.637 --> 00:13:57.917]  Okay?
[00:13:58.598 --> 00:14:03.461]  Passports came out, were found, not damaged, one of them, the other slightly damaged.
[00:14:03.961 --> 00:14:04.381]  It's real.
[00:14:05.242 --> 00:14:05.562]  Okay?
[00:14:08.504 --> 00:14:11.425]  Cell phones working at 30-something thousand feet, real.
[00:14:12.906 --> 00:14:14.968]  All real, all true, nobody's lying to us.
[00:14:16.048 --> 00:14:22.232]  Forget all the scripting that day within 15 minutes saying Bin Laden did it and saying we gotta go into Iraq and all the rest of it.
[00:14:22.252 --> 00:14:23.333]  Let's just forget all of that.
[00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:26.535]  Forget all the scripting that was evidence of the inside job.
[00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:27.035]  Forget it.
[00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:31.080]  For the sake of argument, let's just say Bin Laden did it.
[00:14:32.281 --> 00:14:54.670]  No one can argue and no one can debate that the tragic events, the horrific events of 9-11 have been used to take our liberties and our freedoms and have been used for the military-industrial complex, which are offshore corporations that could care less about America, have used it to put in a
[00:14:56.926 --> 00:15:08.989]  Now in the last nine years, trillion dollar or more, it's hundreds of billions a year, giant infrastructure of control where they profit from surveilling us and violating our rights.
[00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:23.573]  And no one can deny that per state, per year, the Patriot Act on record, it was just in the news again last week, is used in non-terror related cases, marijuana plants, domestic violence, fistfights, embezzlement,
[00:15:25.026 --> 00:15:26.666]  They're suspending the Constitution.
[00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:33.948]  They're suspending due process in thousands of cases per state, every year, using the federal statute.
[00:15:35.308 --> 00:15:39.910]  No one can deny they've gone from saying, oh, just five years ago, we're not listening to you without warrants.
[00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.991]  We promise that we're not listening to you without warrants.
[00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:45.491]  We promise.
[00:15:46.471 --> 00:15:47.852]  Remember Bush and those press conferences?
[00:15:48.412 --> 00:15:53.553]  And then it turned out they were listening to basically everything in real time without warrants, and it's non-terror related.
[00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:56.935]  No one can deny that we're losing our freedoms.
[00:15:57.455 --> 00:16:09.709]  No one can deny that they're training us to have our genitals grabbed on the outside and the inside of our pants and to be put in microwave ovens and the TSA and the federal government and Homeland Security have been caught lying about the radiation level.
[00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:11.891]  No one can deny it.
[00:16:15.215 --> 00:16:15.595]  And so,
[00:16:17.008 --> 00:16:22.592]  Let's just say 9-11 was an outside job run by people out of Afghanistan.
[00:16:22.612 --> 00:16:23.633]  It's not true.
[00:16:24.393 --> 00:16:27.676]  The facts show that it's the opposite, but let's just, for the sake of debate, say that.
[00:16:28.776 --> 00:16:32.979]  Okay, what does giving up my freedoms and my liberties do to protect me from that?
[00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:33.520]  It doesn't.
[00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:40.425]  I mean, Janet Napolitano was in the news last week saying that it's illogical.
[00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:44.808]  It does not make logical sense, was the quote, to profile Muslim men.
[00:16:47.321 --> 00:17:02.197]  Now, 100% of the supposed terror attacks, other than Oklahoma City, the big international and national attacks they hype, 100% are supposedly Muslims.
[00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:06.821]  So, it makes no logical sense to profile them.
[00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:09.423]  See, it's asinine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:27.334]  You know, we had congressmen on at the time, we had sheriffs on, we had state reps on at the time, going back five years ago, six years ago, saying they're not building a fence, they put giant game migration points through them that are five feet tall, where people are allowed to walk through.
[00:17:27.354 --> 00:17:28.775]  The Border Patrol is ordered to not
[00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:33.476]  Stop illegals, except for when news crews are there as part of stunts.
[00:17:34.616 --> 00:17:36.337]  Now all of that has been officially admitted.
[00:17:37.437 --> 00:17:49.800]  And you find out Obama, for two years, has been shipping tens of thousands of guns, knowingly allowing them to be shipped into Mexico, so they can then try to trace them back, to then blame the Second Amendment.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:52.281]  I mean, it's just, it's a joke.
[00:17:53.286 --> 00:17:55.307]  Our liberties are not being taken to protect us.
[00:17:55.367 --> 00:18:02.931]  As Benjamin Franklin said, if you give up your liberty, to paraphrase him, you don't deserve liberty or security, and you're not going to get either.
[00:18:03.731 --> 00:18:05.512]  When you give up liberty, you don't get security.
[00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:07.353]  And that's just common sense.
[00:18:07.893 --> 00:18:15.977]  I mean, who protects us from the big, monolithic, mega-corporations that control our federal government and can get away with bloody murder?
[00:18:16.017 --> 00:18:17.698]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[00:18:19.113 --> 00:18:22.715]  And then you get the law enforcement manuals, you get the training manuals.
[00:18:22.775 --> 00:18:41.183]  I've talked to countless detectives and intelligence unit police, and I see them quoted in the news as well, and they'll admit over nine out of ten times their training seminars are about gun owners, libertarians, people that want to be left alone, people that are growing
[00:18:42.404 --> 00:18:43.325]  Their own crops.
[00:18:43.385 --> 00:18:44.827]  Ooh, these are dirty people.
[00:18:44.847 --> 00:18:47.109]  Ooh, they don't like the Federal Reserve.
[00:18:47.629 --> 00:18:49.231]  They don't like the New World Order.
[00:18:49.271 --> 00:18:50.352]  They want out of the UN.
[00:18:50.693 --> 00:18:51.834]  Well, I'm an American.
[00:18:52.014 --> 00:18:53.495]  I'm allowed to want to have a garden.
[00:18:53.976 --> 00:18:55.538]  I'm allowed to think fluoride's bad.
[00:18:55.578 --> 00:18:56.238]  I have the proof.
[00:18:56.859 --> 00:18:59.762]  I'm allowed to not like the private Federal Reserve we didn't have until 1913.
[00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:03.746]  I'm allowed to not like the IRS that we didn't have until 1913.
[00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:12.964]  I'm allowed to not like the fact that our senators are popularly elected instead of being elected by the state legislatures.
[00:19:15.546 --> 00:19:22.795]  I'm allowed to be informed and know that the Tenth Amendment and states' rights are the secret to getting this country back.
[00:19:22.915 --> 00:19:26.018]  I'm not bad because I know what America's all about.
[00:19:27.028 --> 00:19:35.513]  And so, while you're being told, give up your rights to fight Al-Qaeda, when you actually get into the real training, it's all about you.
[00:19:36.434 --> 00:19:37.874]  And that's the paradox here.
[00:19:38.335 --> 00:19:44.438]  The average hardcore conservative is a good person, even if they're misinformed on many subjects of the war on terror.
[00:19:45.059 --> 00:19:51.863]  And while they're supporting these attacks on liberty, to protect America, they don't know behind the scenes, it's all about them.
[00:19:53.264 --> 00:19:53.965]  They're supporting.
[00:19:54.725 --> 00:19:59.110]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about a product the drug companies don't want you to know about.
[00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.672]  It's called Osteo-K.
[00:20:01.012 --> 00:20:08.179]  Osteo-K is an osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the dangerous side effects of medications.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.002]  Calcium and vitamin D only decrease fractures by 16%.
[00:20:12.064 --> 00:20:14.326]  Osteo-K decreases fractures an astounding 87%.
[00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:17.847]  Friends, osteoporosis is a deadly disease.
[00:20:18.088 --> 00:20:22.448]  Research shows the most effective approach for protecting your bones is not a drug at all.
[00:20:22.628 --> 00:20:25.609]  It's Osteo-K, manufactured entirely in America.
[00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:30.330]  Osteo-K is available without a prescription and comes with an unconditional money-back guarantee.
[00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:36.791]  Don't wait until it's too late, because if you have osteoporosis and fracture a hip, you have a 20% chance of dying within a year.
[00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:39.112]  I urge you to take charge of your health today.
[00:20:39.352 --> 00:20:41.332]  I cannot recommend this breakthrough product enough.
[00:20:41.572 --> 00:20:43.393]  Go to www.nbihealth.com.

[00:21:23.419 --> 00:21:32.685]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:32.745 --> 00:21:33.466]  This capitalism?
[00:21:33.526 --> 00:21:39.670]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:40.631]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:40.671 --> 00:21:43.773]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:44.693]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:44.733 --> 00:21:45.774]  It's time to understand the system.
[00:21:45.814 --> 00:21:46.414]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.454 --> 00:21:46.735]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:56.020]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.261]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:58.281 --> 00:22:01.143]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:01.623 --> 00:22:06.365]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:10.907]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:11.227 --> 00:22:13.550]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.113]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:16.453 --> 00:22:19.036]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:19.376 --> 00:22:26.985]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:27.307 --> 00:22:32.570]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:35.512]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:35.552 --> 00:22:38.994]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:39.234 --> 00:22:40.155]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:40.315 --> 00:22:41.616]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:41.656 --> 00:22:42.636]  Invisible Empire.

[00:23:00.459 --> 00:23:09.785]  Bypass way stations, fly by port of entry facilities, stay moving at highway speed, while the guy without PrePass waits in line.
[00:23:12.205 --> 00:23:13.987]  Save time, save money.

[00:23:19.153 --> 00:23:22.156]  That's 888-401-PASS.
[00:23:22.477 --> 00:23:23.638]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:23:23.798 --> 00:23:28.203]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:23:28.363 --> 00:23:31.647]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't
[00:23:31.647 --> 00:23:31.967]  Thank you.
[00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:10.882]  I focus on the pain.
[00:24:20.639 --> 00:24:23.021]  The only thing that's real.
[00:24:23.741 --> 00:24:30.266]  The needle tears a hole.
[00:24:30.646 --> 00:24:34.028]  The old familiar pain.
[00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:35.970]  But I remember.
[00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:39.232]  I love Johnny Cash.
[00:24:50.563 --> 00:24:53.225]  What have I become?
[00:24:54.045 --> 00:24:55.246]  My sweetest friend.
[00:24:56.446 --> 00:24:58.447]  My sweetest friend.
[00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:08.153]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[00:25:08.213 --> 00:25:09.614]  And this says it all.
[00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.311]  And you could have it all.
[00:25:14.612 --> 00:25:16.572]  My empire of dirt.
[00:25:16.933 --> 00:25:20.134]  My empire of dirt.
[00:25:20.954 --> 00:25:25.416]  I will let you down.
[00:25:25.536 --> 00:25:27.897]  I will make you hurt.
[00:25:27.937 --> 00:25:29.678]  I will make you hurt.
[00:25:30.798 --> 00:25:31.179]  Alright.
[00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:32.719]  Enough of the great one.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:35.540]  Yeah, that's another point I want to make.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.042]  Then I'm getting into all the new FBI powers, all the incredible police state stuff.
[00:25:41.803 --> 00:25:47.347]  You know, yesterday, I'm not going to tell the story, because it's unbelievable, but it's on record.
[00:25:50.169 --> 00:25:56.994]  I had something bad happen yesterday, and when the police were getting ready to put the person in handcuffs, I just said, let him go.
[00:25:58.055 --> 00:26:02.678]  Even though this person was demonic, horrible, evil, laughing at me, God just said, let him go.
[00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:08.440]  I'm not going to tell the story.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:08.740]  That's it.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.500]  I'm not talking about it.
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.104]  You know, the issue is that I know the system's coming after me.
[00:26:15.905 --> 00:26:16.845]  And that's fine.
[00:26:18.587 --> 00:26:30.295]  Because people that are serving this corrupt system, you are in the crosshairs just as much as I am.
[00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:34.338]  This is a system that is insane.
[00:26:35.521 --> 00:26:56.756]  Just on the genetic engineering front alone, with the cows that produce human breast milk and the monkeys that glow in the dark and have the jellyfish genes and the sometimes a hundred different insect genes in one plant that we're then eating, I mean, do I need to explain to you
[00:26:57.777 --> 00:27:00.160]  The fact that it's not a question of if but when.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:06.567]  We're not just going to have increased allergies and bowel disorders and diabetes and cancer from these GMOs.
[00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:17.920]  It is undoubted that it's going to create super mutagens that are going to create plagues that are going to make the black plague that killed 30 to 40 percent of Europe look like a Sunday picnic.
[00:27:20.143 --> 00:27:21.364]  And where else do I go?
[00:27:21.404 --> 00:27:23.186]  I have thousands of such issues to cover here.
[00:27:23.766 --> 00:27:24.727]  And it's not my opinion.
[00:27:24.787 --> 00:27:26.889]  I'm absolutely targeted on this.
[00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:28.110]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.611]  We're destroying ourselves.
[00:27:33.734 --> 00:27:40.479]  You know, I went to the Talkers event and I meant to write some notes up on it this morning and give my reflections on it.
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:48.126]  It's a very important, the most important individual insider talk radio event.
[00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:49.427]  It's been going on for decades.
[00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:54.562]  And Rush Limbaugh has been the keynote speaker, Sean Hannity, people like that in the past.
[00:27:55.623 --> 00:28:04.366]  And I went, and I was the keynote speaker, and I was shocked to see congressmen, former congressmen, you know, Stephen Baldwin in the audience, Fox News people.
[00:28:04.386 --> 00:28:07.268]  I was like, wow, this really is high-powered.
[00:28:07.928 --> 00:28:10.749]  And I got up there and, you know, gave them, I think, an okay speech.
[00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:15.191]  It wasn't one of my better ones, but they put out a press release saying it was dynamite.
[00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:27.139]  And then I was there with a station owner that's got me on a few other stations and he played me a commentary that is off his iPhone that his mother had done about me on the radio.
[00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:41.362]  And I looked at the guy, this is when we were eating dinner, and I said, you think it makes me feel good that your smart, sweet old mother looks up to me and thinks I'm this great guy and has all this love for me in her voice?
[00:28:41.482 --> 00:28:42.982]  I said, no, it makes me feel horrible.
[00:28:44.912 --> 00:28:45.953]  He's like, why do you say that?
[00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:52.137]  And it's not that I'm ashamed of what I've done and it's not that I'm misleading people.
[00:28:54.199 --> 00:28:58.241]  I'm proud of a lot of what I've done, but compared to what I'm proud of,
[00:28:59.418 --> 00:29:11.927]  I also am disgusted with my delivery and disgusted with who I am because I never expected to be in this position and to have my position of prominence and power growing exponentially.
[00:29:13.829 --> 00:29:14.669]  It's not fun.
[00:29:14.689 --> 00:29:19.873]  Again, I'm not criticizing her.
[00:29:20.134 --> 00:29:22.936]  I'm saying a nice, good person counting on me.
[00:29:24.369 --> 00:29:35.258]  The responsibility of all these young people and old people and at the airports, families with shining eyes coming up to me, looking at me like I'm going to save them.
[00:29:36.299 --> 00:29:41.463]  I mean, I just... I'm going to try to quantify it when I come back.
[00:29:41.784 --> 00:29:44.626]  I just... I never knew this responsibility would feel like this.
[00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:45.627]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.107 --> 00:29:47.709]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.629 --> 00:29:51.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.295 --> 00:29:58.538]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:29:58.858 --> 00:29:59.458]  Number one.
[00:29:59.758 --> 00:30:02.920]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:03.181 --> 00:30:03.761]  Number two.
[00:30:04.041 --> 00:30:08.604]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:08.944 --> 00:30:09.385]  It's true.
[00:30:09.685 --> 00:30:14.248]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:14.548 --> 00:30:15.108]  Number three.
[00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:18.670]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:18.971 --> 00:30:22.673]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:22.873 --> 00:30:23.414]  Number 4.
[00:30:23.674 --> 00:30:26.037]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:26.417 --> 00:30:29.802]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:30.102 --> 00:30:30.322]  Number 5.
[00:30:30.903 --> 00:30:34.828]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:35.048 --> 00:30:39.814]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:40.094 --> 00:30:44.118]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:44.258 --> 00:30:45.820]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.122]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:30:48.302 --> 00:30:50.645]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:30:55.185 --> 00:30:56.687]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:56.887 --> 00:31:01.934]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:31:02.214 --> 00:31:03.576]  Saving means to make money.
[00:31:03.737 --> 00:31:12.528]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:31:13.249 --> 00:31:20.353]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:31:20.793 --> 00:31:28.397]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:31:28.797 --> 00:31:33.719]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.181]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:31:38.962 --> 00:31:41.888]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:31:42.169 --> 00:31:44.494]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091.
[00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:46.698]  Or see Calvin on the web at 5starsoap.com.
[00:31:54.975 --> 00:31:58.619]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:31:58.999 --> 00:32:02.002]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:02.242 --> 00:32:07.026]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:32:07.046 --> 00:32:13.292]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:13.432 --> 00:32:15.675]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:16.215 --> 00:32:16.495]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:16.515 --> 00:32:16.935]  Bernanke?
[00:32:16.995 --> 00:32:17.356]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:17.376 --> 00:32:18.116]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:18.136 --> 00:32:19.777]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:35.103 --> 00:32:42.051]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:42.392 --> 00:32:51.502]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:32:55.862 --> 00:32:57.742]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:32:57.763 --> 00:32:58.703]  A lie!
[00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:00.843]  No man is obsolete!
[00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:02.964]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[00:33:03.004 --> 00:33:05.885]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[00:33:06.265 --> 00:33:11.326]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[00:33:11.706 --> 00:33:14.467]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect!
[00:33:15.147 --> 00:33:18.928]  Ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[00:33:19.569 --> 00:33:20.649]  I am a human being!
[00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:28.271]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[00:33:28.792 --> 00:33:29.512]  I don't care!
[00:33:29.932 --> 00:33:30.972]  I tell you, I don't care!
[00:33:30.992 --> 00:33:33.093]  I'm a human being, I exist!
[00:33:33.173 --> 00:33:35.734]  And if I speak one thought aloud,
[00:33:36.516 --> 00:33:39.777]  That thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[00:33:40.238 --> 00:33:42.959]  Delusions, Mr. Woolardworth!
[00:33:43.399 --> 00:33:50.842]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[00:33:51.102 --> 00:33:56.465]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and mistake has no use for your kind!
[00:33:58.145 --> 00:34:01.667]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:02.247 --> 00:34:03.968]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:07.878 --> 00:34:13.603]  Alright, you tune into this broadcast for the history, the philosophy, the guest, the news.
[00:34:16.145 --> 00:34:25.632]  But, really trying to quantify what I was getting into earlier, it's really simply this.
[00:34:26.193 --> 00:34:34.520]  To have so many people counting on me, to have so many people looking up to me, I just see myself as a fighter against tyranny.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.421]  I see myself as someone who wants to be free.
[00:34:37.881 --> 00:34:40.702]  But then in my own humanness, I know I make mistakes.
[00:34:41.302 --> 00:34:44.883]  I know I fail just as many times as I succeed.
[00:34:45.583 --> 00:34:47.784]  And then I realize that people are looking up to me.
[00:34:47.924 --> 00:34:49.525]  I've got to do an even better job.
[00:34:50.385 --> 00:34:52.986]  And I see my own weak, frail humanness.
[00:34:54.086 --> 00:35:05.750]  And I realize I don't have the answers or all the answers or enough energy to ever deliver things perfectly to people or anywhere close to it.
[00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:11.411]  And it's just, it's quite an experience.
[00:35:12.552 --> 00:35:22.195]  It is quite an experience in the final equation to constantly see so many people
[00:35:23.021 --> 00:35:23.722]  Looking up to me.
[00:35:25.044 --> 00:35:27.187]  Because I think, what if I make a mistake?
[00:35:27.488 --> 00:35:30.913]  What if I let the enemy destroy me?
[00:35:31.053 --> 00:35:35.680]  What if, what if everything then
[00:35:36.792 --> 00:35:40.076]  You know, it begins to be about Alex Jones and the fight against tyranny.
[00:35:40.776 --> 00:35:50.947]  Instead of the fight against tyranny, then I can be destroyed politically or physically and then they can tell whatever lies they want.
[00:35:51.287 --> 00:35:51.908]  That's the thing.
[00:35:52.489 --> 00:35:58.395]  It's the realization that even if I do the very best job I can, the system will just make stuff up.
[00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:06.604]  Or the system will take things and twist them and then try to hurt our movement for free humanity through that.
[00:36:07.124 --> 00:36:15.548]  It's just the continued awakening to the fact that with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:36:15.568 --> 00:36:18.390]  I go back to one of the Spider-Man movies I saw.
[00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:19.450]  I haven't seen them all.
[00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:24.733]  I've seen one of them, but it's the one where they don't pay him his money after he's been wrestling.
[00:36:26.102 --> 00:36:29.004]  And he's just beating, you know, the other wrestler.
[00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:32.247]  And he goes in the back room and says, give me my money.
[00:36:32.287 --> 00:36:35.329]  And they cheat him and say, nah, kid, you didn't read the fine print.
[00:36:35.729 --> 00:36:37.831]  And a guy comes in and robs him.
[00:36:38.651 --> 00:36:43.034]  And he has a chance to stop him, but he doesn't stop the robber.
[00:36:43.915 --> 00:36:53.642]  And the robber says, thanks, kid, and runs out on the street and then kills his uncle, carjacks his uncle that was there to pick him up.
[00:36:56.894 --> 00:37:02.677]  And then he sees, oh my gosh, I thought I was doing something evil to get back at somebody, but it came right back on me.
[00:37:03.038 --> 00:37:06.239]  See, I'm actually aware that that's how the universe works.
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:08.481]  And so I constantly try to be moral.
[00:37:08.901 --> 00:37:10.502]  I constantly try to be good.
[00:37:10.982 --> 00:37:12.503]  I constantly try to be upstanding.
[00:37:12.603 --> 00:37:14.865]  I constantly try to get it right.
[00:37:14.945 --> 00:37:18.186]  But I'm human like everybody else, and then in hindsight,
[00:37:19.247 --> 00:37:31.194]  Days later, weeks later, years later, I will see things I've done that weren't accurate completely, or things that weren't right, or times I lost my temper, or times I was worldly, or arrogant, or overly competitive.
[00:37:32.415 --> 00:37:39.859]  And it's really the horror of realizing that I'm fallen, just like everybody else on this planet.
[00:37:40.993 --> 00:37:52.735]  And then there's the pain of seeing other people who are 10, 20, 30, 40 times more worldly, more corrupt than I am, who they want to be corrupt.
[00:37:52.775 --> 00:37:53.795]  They think it's good.
[00:37:53.855 --> 00:37:56.876]  They've completely given themselves over to it.
[00:37:57.376 --> 00:38:00.256]  And I don't even hate those people anymore.
[00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:01.717]  I'm not even angry at them anymore.
[00:38:01.757 --> 00:38:05.977]  Before, I hated them, was angry at them, and that was somewhat of a psychological shield.
[00:38:06.637 --> 00:38:09.118]  Now, I'm more just depressed by it.
[00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:18.840]  But then I see all the positive good things in the world, and I think about how good people are.
[00:38:20.021 --> 00:38:28.268]  If we could just get the good, kind-hearted, loving, intelligent people out there who don't see themselves as leaders to see themselves as leaders.
[00:38:29.989 --> 00:38:32.552]  There are people out there listening to this broadcast right now.
[00:38:33.971 --> 00:38:56.005]  That if you got involved in the media, if you got involved in warning people, if you started an AXS television show, if you went and got a local weekend radio show, and if you organized and turned loose your passion and got involved and didn't get tied down by infighting and COINTELPRO, that you would be able to do things much greater than I've done.
[00:38:58.107 --> 00:38:59.489]  And it's that potential.
[00:38:59.849 --> 00:39:03.292]  Humanity has a potential to reach the stars.
[00:39:03.693 --> 00:39:05.875]  Not reach for the stars, reach the stars.
[00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:11.681]  And we also have the potential to drag civilization into absolute hell.
[00:39:13.543 --> 00:39:18.868]  And every form of avarice and corruption and degeneracy is being turned loose.
[00:39:18.888 --> 00:39:20.890]  When I go on trips and I see the public,
[00:39:21.556 --> 00:39:24.499]  And I travel, and I listen to people, and I watch them.
[00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:36.809]  It is such an amalgamation of decadence, and sullenness, and entitlement, and corruption, and people obsessed with diversions.
[00:39:36.909 --> 00:39:42.514]  I mean, I see it all, and I see humanity being sucked downward.
[00:39:43.074 --> 00:39:45.216]  At the same time, I see other people rising.
[00:39:45.797 --> 00:39:47.718]  So it's a spectrum.
[00:39:47.758 --> 00:39:49.440]  It's not just humanity sinking.
[00:39:50.598 --> 00:39:51.518]  It's hills and valleys.
[00:39:51.618 --> 00:39:56.300]  Some people are rising, others are sinking, and it's a battle going on.
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:40:00.141]  There is, at the end of the day, there is a battle of good and evil.
[00:40:00.522 --> 00:40:03.343]  We wouldn't have a private Federal Reserve running our society.
[00:40:03.383 --> 00:40:13.726]  We wouldn't have a society dominated by lies and deception if good people hadn't slowly been seduced by degrees to accept it, is what I'm saying.
[00:40:13.766 --> 00:40:17.528]  So more and more, it's the philosophy of liberty versus tyranny.
[00:40:18.208 --> 00:40:25.354]  That dominates culture and you have to be able to recognize what is liberty, what is tyranny, what is good, what is evil.
[00:40:25.814 --> 00:40:31.739]  And more and more it is the ability to recognize reality that will save our society or doom it.
[00:40:32.519 --> 00:40:39.324]  As Winston Smith being tortured in the fictional 1984 says, freedom is the power to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:40:40.493 --> 00:40:42.014]  And that sounds ridiculous.
[00:40:42.034 --> 00:40:43.814]  You're like, well, I can say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:40:44.314 --> 00:40:45.975]  Can you say 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[00:40:47.175 --> 00:40:50.336]  Or do you sit there like the BBC did when they were here a few weeks ago?
[00:40:50.356 --> 00:40:51.797]  I haven't even talked about this.
[00:40:53.197 --> 00:40:56.419]  And I'm in the interview with the guy, and I was very depressed after the interview.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.040]  And I wanted to get out of the interview.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:05.242]  Not because I, after the show, not because I couldn't answer the questions.
[00:41:05.742 --> 00:41:09.103]  I didn't want to be in the presence of the person.
[00:41:11.584 --> 00:41:20.567]  I sat there and he had all his little 9-11 questions that he was all prepared for, and things that were honeypots, things that couldn't be proven one way or the other.
[00:41:22.448 --> 00:41:29.350]  And I would say, well, what about the magic passports coming out of the planes and then down to the ground and then being found?
[00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.511]  I mean, that's impossible on both counts.
[00:41:31.911 --> 00:41:36.652]  It's impossible they would survive unharmed, but it's near impossible they would be immediately found.
[00:41:37.252 --> 00:41:38.633]  I mean, do you see how convenient that is?
[00:41:39.827 --> 00:41:43.230]  And I said, you notice they don't use that anymore.
[00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:48.053]  In fact, within a few weeks they quit using that in the media because it was so ridiculous.
[00:41:48.073 --> 00:41:48.934]  People were like, what?
[00:41:48.954 --> 00:41:51.376]  I mean, even the dumbed down public didn't buy that.
[00:41:51.996 --> 00:41:55.899]  And the guy just giggled at me and smiled with a twinkle and said, I do believe it.
[00:41:56.239 --> 00:41:58.241]  And right then I realized this is a mercenary.
[00:41:58.741 --> 00:41:59.942]  This guy could care less.
[00:42:00.742 --> 00:42:02.284]  He could care less what the truth is.
[00:42:02.644 --> 00:42:05.326]  He was a cold blooded mercenary and
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:23.598]  I had a desire to do something, you know, because I knew, see, if I'm confronted with some gutter snipe level decadent person that's turned himself over to the world, but just thinks that that's what life is, then I feel sorry for him.
[00:42:23.618 --> 00:42:28.443]  But when I'm confronted with someone who knows and thinks this stuff's funny,
[00:42:35.489 --> 00:42:38.191]  You think I want to come on air and say 9-11's an inside job?
[00:42:39.912 --> 00:42:46.677]  Do you think my ego wanted to lose two-thirds of the affiliates I had nine years ago when 9-11 took place?
[00:42:47.538 --> 00:42:48.799]  We were over a hundred stations.
[00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:51.501]  We've just now gone over a hundred since then.
[00:42:53.442 --> 00:42:59.647]  And Ted Anderson didn't censor me, great guy that he is, but he would come in and say, well, these stations are going to turn you off if you don't stop talking about it.
[00:42:59.907 --> 00:43:00.828]  I'd say, I can't stop.
[00:43:01.288 --> 00:43:01.849]  Ted said, okay.
[00:43:02.649 --> 00:43:02.930]  But see,
[00:43:04.593 --> 00:43:12.295]  For me, it's not that I'm some great, wonderful, moral person that I can't compromise, that I can't sell out, consciously.
[00:43:13.115 --> 00:43:18.357]  My fear is I'll make mistakes and end up selling out even if I don't try, by degrees.
[00:43:23.198 --> 00:43:29.440]  And here I am nine years later, more successful than I've ever been at getting the word out to people.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:44.008]  Well, you know, I rarely get up here and actually engage in open soul-searching on the air, so I know this makes a lot of sense to some people, doesn't make sense to other people.
[00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:45.589]  I'm just being 100% real with you.
[00:43:46.630 --> 00:44:00.101]  And I wish every day, a lot of times I wake up at like 3, 4 in the morning with my heart pounding, wishing that 9-11 wasn't an inside job.
[00:44:03.584 --> 00:44:10.688]  And not because I've had to be demonized and attacked and ridiculed and scorned and been a heretic for telling the truth.
[00:44:10.728 --> 00:44:11.168]  No, no, no, no.
[00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:15.310]  I wake up in the middle of the night because it's scary that it's an inside job.
[00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:19.032]  I know why people are repulsed by it, why people run from it.
[00:44:19.412 --> 00:44:22.054]  Because, yeah, believe me, I want to run from it too.
[00:44:22.414 --> 00:44:23.755]  But you can't run from it.
[00:44:24.135 --> 00:44:28.718]  If it is an inside job, what does that say about the system that runs our country?
[00:44:29.039 --> 00:44:31.200]  What does that say about how much trouble we're in?
[00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:34.642]  Oh, believe me, I know why you don't want to face that fact.
[00:44:34.962 --> 00:44:36.383]  Because it is frightening.
[00:44:37.464 --> 00:44:39.165]  It is nauseating.
[00:44:39.305 --> 00:44:40.626]  It is terrifying.
[00:44:41.927 --> 00:44:47.411]  It screams danger, danger, danger, danger, danger at Will Robinson.
[00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:53.634]  But all of you in your gut, are you more afraid of the turban men with the big beards?
[00:44:54.034 --> 00:44:57.878]  If they were all gone tomorrow, would you be at peace?
[00:44:57.958 --> 00:44:58.478]  No, you wouldn't be.
[00:44:58.899 --> 00:45:02.782]  Everybody knows in their gut, and intellectually, who the threat is.
[00:45:03.743 --> 00:45:04.524]  It's the government.
[00:45:05.643 --> 00:45:06.864]  But that's an oversimplification.
[00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:10.047]  The government's made of people just like you and I. It's the people running it.
[00:45:10.327 --> 00:45:11.308]  It's the philosophy.
[00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:12.369]  It's the captain.
[00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.172]  I'm not worried about the guy in engineering running the boilers.
[00:45:15.432 --> 00:45:19.096]  I'm not worried about the person up on the top deck bussing tables.
[00:45:19.296 --> 00:45:20.537]  I'm not worried about the bartender.
[00:45:20.557 --> 00:45:22.799]  I'm not worried about the lady that changes the beds.
[00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:25.622]  I'm not worried about the people that are working in the galley.
[00:45:26.122 --> 00:45:27.163]  I'm not worried about the doctor.
[00:45:27.183 --> 00:45:29.145]  I'm not worried about the dentist and the cruise ship.
[00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:30.727]  I'm worried about the captain.
[00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:50.923]  And his inner crew are a bunch of murderous scum who write books about how much they want to set up world government and exterminate us, and they publish the books, they constantly talk about it, the White House science czar, on and on and on, Ted Turner, Prince Philip, all of them, and I'm here saying, folks, we're in trouble!
[00:45:51.483 --> 00:45:52.883]  They're like, well, our government wouldn't do that.
[00:45:53.103 --> 00:45:54.784]  Our government's been taken over!
[00:45:56.524 --> 00:45:57.544]  I'll use another analogy.
[00:45:58.564 --> 00:46:01.025]  If you were on board a plane, this has happened a lot of times in history,
[00:46:02.114 --> 00:46:17.860]  Because hijackers, there have been real hijackers in history, real terrorists, real political activists that think they're doing this to draw attention to something, but they are going after men, women, and children, which in the code of ethics in war is disgusting and filthy and bad.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:20.341]  In the modern time, they call it terrorist.
[00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:28.644]  Whether it's bombing Dresden or bombing London or bombing Tokyo or killing men, women, and children by anybody.
[00:46:29.696 --> 00:46:30.536]  It's a war crime.
[00:46:30.616 --> 00:46:31.497]  It's against humanity.
[00:46:31.797 --> 00:46:33.577]  The rules are you don't touch women and children.
[00:46:38.659 --> 00:46:44.081]  And what happens is I start going down one path while I'm talking and I forget what the original point was.
[00:46:44.121 --> 00:46:47.622]  Why was I... Why was I getting off into that?
[00:46:52.084 --> 00:46:54.605]  Well, I remember Rush Limbaugh a few months ago.
[00:46:57.406 --> 00:46:57.726]  He was...
[00:46:59.366 --> 00:47:05.708]  Talking about the Rolling Stone articles where they're killing innocent people, shooting innocent people in Afghanistan.
[00:47:06.308 --> 00:47:09.909]  And he said, oh, well, the Army is not doing a good job.
[00:47:10.549 --> 00:47:11.290]  We played the clip.
[00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:15.631]  He goes, I agree with Rolling Stone and the media, but not in the way they think.
[00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:21.753]  The Army is saying, we're sorry we're accidentally killing innocent people.
[00:47:22.113 --> 00:47:26.094]  And Limbaugh said, well, there used to be a time in this country when we wanted to kill everybody.
[00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:33.952]  And that's how we won, bombing Dresden in Germany, bombing Tokyo, bombing Hiroshima, bombing Nagasaki.
[00:47:36.913 --> 00:47:40.495]  He said, you know, there was a time in America when we wanted to kill women and children.
[00:47:44.717 --> 00:47:49.599]  And I just listened to that, like some men think it's tough to talk about killing women and children.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.241]  You see, once you get rid of those rules,
[00:47:57.017 --> 00:48:00.998]  Once you get rid of those rules, then everybody's fair game.
[00:48:03.839 --> 00:48:08.501]  And I thought about how people think it's manly to be for torture and secret arrest.
[00:48:08.541 --> 00:48:09.341]  They think it's tough.
[00:48:09.761 --> 00:48:10.542]  They think it's cool.
[00:48:10.602 --> 00:48:11.522]  They think it's sexy.
[00:48:13.803 --> 00:48:14.283]  And it's not.
[00:48:15.143 --> 00:48:20.885]  Other civilizations, time and time again, have figured out that that's against the rules because really bad things happen.
[00:48:21.125 --> 00:48:23.466]  If men want to march off and kill each other, that's one thing.
[00:48:25.796 --> 00:48:30.480]  But no, the United States up until World War II never acted like that and never behaved like that.
[00:48:32.963 --> 00:48:37.467]  And so now we're told, well, we should behave like that again.
[00:48:37.487 --> 00:48:42.531]  And that somehow that's tough.
[00:48:45.034 --> 00:48:48.136]  But then we're told if Arabs target us the same way,
[00:48:49.226 --> 00:48:55.128]  But not with 2,000-pound bombs dropped on villages, but with bombs strapped to themselves.
[00:48:55.188 --> 00:48:55.868]  They're cowards.
[00:48:55.908 --> 00:48:56.628]  They're terrorists.
[00:48:56.948 --> 00:48:57.608]  They're bad.
[00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:58.309]  They're evil.
[00:48:58.689 --> 00:48:59.809]  Oh my gosh, it's horrible.
[00:49:00.629 --> 00:49:04.070]  Oh my gosh, Gaddafi might have shot some protesters, so let's invade.
[00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:05.891]  But it's not an invasion.
[00:49:06.871 --> 00:49:09.111]  But oh my gosh, Israel just mowed down a bunch of people.
[00:49:09.412 --> 00:49:10.312]  That's a good thing to do.
[00:49:10.732 --> 00:49:17.834]  Whether you're for Israel doing that or not, just don't give me your schizophrenic, double-think,
[00:49:19.195 --> 00:49:27.879]  hypocritical line about how you care about humanity and you care about individuals and you care about not killing civilians.
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:31.940]  That's the point I'm getting at.
[00:49:34.801 --> 00:49:43.665]  But up until World War II our government didn't do that and certainly Hitler was a bad warmonger and did attack civilian cities when he invaded Poland and other areas.
[00:49:44.425 --> 00:49:45.786]  But with the British
[00:49:47.321 --> 00:50:00.429]  He targeted military bases first in the Blitz, and then the British flew in a big Saudi of aircraft and bombed Berlin and civilian targets, and it was later declassified.
[00:50:00.449 --> 00:50:06.592]  They did that knowing that Hitler would then turn his attack onto the civilian cities and not the military bases.
[00:50:07.873 --> 00:50:14.837]  And they also, in the report, said that would then, in their psychological research, would get the British fully behind the war when they were targeted.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.321]  And so then the rest is history.
[00:50:20.582 --> 00:50:21.783]  Germany was completely leveled.
[00:50:21.803 --> 00:50:23.204]  More than 20 million Germans died.
[00:50:25.806 --> 00:50:30.609]  And Hitler was played like a fiddle.
[00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:33.672]  500,000 people died, what, in one week of bombing on Dresden.
[00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:37.635]  Which was, quote, a safe city for the children.
[00:50:39.423 --> 00:50:43.631]  So I don't care if it's a black African child, a German child, whoever it is in war.
[00:50:43.812 --> 00:50:48.220]  Just because you're fighting with somebody's daddy doesn't mean you kill their two-year-old baby.
[00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:49.743]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:49.783 --> 00:50:50.244]  Stay with us.

[00:54:12.145 --> 00:54:20.650]  What I was really getting at earlier, I think in summation, is that we're all in individual struggles with ourselves to decide what do we stand for?
[00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:21.490]  Who are we?
[00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:23.411]  What is our cultural values?
[00:54:24.472 --> 00:54:34.818]  And the American cultural values, and it's not that the United States has ever been perfect, but the American cultural values, what America stood for, what made this country great, is under assault.
[00:54:35.598 --> 00:54:42.116]  Anyone who studied basic history, common sense, knows that whether it's Republicans or Democrats, at the end of the day,
[00:54:43.308 --> 00:54:46.370]  We're losing everything that was good about this country.
[00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:48.791]  And this nation's going in the wrong direction.
[00:54:49.311 --> 00:54:51.032]  And lies have become the norm.
[00:54:51.453 --> 00:55:00.938]  Not just Wiener Gate, or Bill Clinton lying, or George W. Bush lying about WMDs, or his dad lying about, read my lips, no new taxes.
[00:55:01.698 --> 00:55:03.199]  But a lot bigger lies.
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:09.723]  The not-so-dominant old line media, the dying media, the dying corporate media,
[00:55:11.075 --> 00:55:12.576]  Loves to focus on a wiener gate.
[00:55:13.216 --> 00:55:16.559]  Loves to focus on something that's individualized at one person.
[00:55:16.979 --> 00:55:19.080]  That doesn't indict the whole system for its lies.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:25.004]  But our fundamental monetary system has been a lie for 97 plus years.
[00:55:25.364 --> 00:55:28.746]  It'll be 100 years coming up in 2013.
[00:55:28.786 --> 00:55:28.806]  1913-2013.
[00:55:36.127 --> 00:55:40.794]  It's a fact of this monetary system that for every dollar created, a dollar of debt is created.
[00:55:41.134 --> 00:55:42.757]  And we are to pay that debt to who?
[00:55:43.237 --> 00:55:44.299]  The private Federal Reserve.
[00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:46.762]  And we're now coming to the end of the cycle.
[00:55:47.663 --> 00:55:48.925]  We've now had our wealth stolen.
[00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:50.247]  We've had our buying power stolen.
[00:55:51.038 --> 00:55:52.279]  We've been de-industrialized.
[00:55:52.299 --> 00:55:55.422]  We were told NAFTA and GATT would be great, that Walmart would be wonderful.
[00:55:55.683 --> 00:55:57.044]  Walmart's profits are plunging.
[00:55:57.104 --> 00:56:07.874]  I was just reading an article yesterday where they're now going to roll out with small local stores trying to put what's left out of business because their big box business is falling apart.
[00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:14.341]  But that's a necessary process of what Walmart's done, of what Chinese slave goods have done.
[00:56:15.137 --> 00:56:17.900]  Is that at the end, Walmart destroys itself.
[00:56:18.361 --> 00:56:22.966]  But the people running it don't care because they will always move on to the next country, which they admit they're doing.
[00:56:22.986 --> 00:56:29.253]  That's what they're doing their main investments now, outside the US, even though the US is over 60% of their total global profit.
[00:56:29.553 --> 00:56:30.654]  So they're done.
[00:56:30.694 --> 00:56:31.635]  They've mined us out.
[00:56:32.256 --> 00:56:34.277]  There was no attitude of build-up America.
[00:56:34.597 --> 00:56:40.560]  It was just, oh, we've got big American flags hanging up, made in America, by America, and then you can't find American in there.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.321]  But people think they're buying American because there's big American flags up everywhere.
[00:56:44.762 --> 00:56:48.703]  And I think that jingoism symbolizes the curse that we're under.
[00:56:48.723 --> 00:56:51.124]  And I'm not even just going after Walmart here.
[00:56:52.065 --> 00:56:57.247]  That there's American flags everywhere, but even the American flags hanging on the wall are made in China.
[00:56:58.427 --> 00:57:01.529]  So you feel good while you're there buying the stuff at Walmart,
[00:57:04.369 --> 00:57:05.209]  It's all a lie!
[00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:07.330]  And a lie will get you hurt!
[00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:09.451]  Okay, look.
[00:57:11.432 --> 00:57:12.092]  I've been ranting.
[00:57:13.373 --> 00:57:16.614]  And we do have Dominique Betting, a member of the Swiss Parliament, coming on.
[00:57:16.714 --> 00:57:17.955]  Incredibly positive.
[00:57:18.335 --> 00:57:20.196]  Historical things happened at Bilderberg.
[00:57:20.796 --> 00:57:25.338]  And I think what I was getting to earlier is I don't even feel worthy to even cover things that are this important.
[00:57:25.718 --> 00:57:27.179]  And all the subtle intricacies.
[00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:31.121]  A lot of times when I leave the show at the end of the day, I feel terrible.
[00:57:31.161 --> 00:57:32.721]  I feel like I should have made these points.
[00:57:32.762 --> 00:57:33.622]  I should have made that point.
[00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:47.020]  And it's because I have an intense desire to warn people, an intense desire to turn things around, an intense desire to not go down the road we're going down.
[00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:56.227]  And I get frustrated by seeing people who have no desire to be informed, no desire to be involved in society, no desire to be players on the field.
[00:57:56.548 --> 00:57:57.749]  They just want to be spectators.
[00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:05.632]  But the good news at the end of the day is this, it's never been a majority that engages in evil and takes over.
[00:58:06.573 --> 00:58:08.394]  It's never been a majority that defeats the evil.
[00:58:08.894 --> 00:58:19.020]  It's always a minority on the side of evil and a minority on the side of good that are able to either take over for bad or take over for good.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:27.585]  Alright, tons of news coming up on a host of issues, video clips, a guest, and I will give the phone number out later to talk about any issues you want.
[00:58:28.746 --> 00:58:31.371]  I need to come back and now start getting into some of the news.
[00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:32.292]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:38.063 --> 00:58:42.050]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:44.505 --> 00:58:49.507]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[00:58:49.908 --> 00:58:51.168]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[00:59:00.012 --> 00:59:02.853]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[00:59:03.214 --> 00:59:04.134]  Are you kidding me?
[00:59:04.334 --> 00:59:10.377]  For the cost of one greasy, fast-food, super-sized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.
[00:59:10.837 --> 00:59:13.859]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.

[00:59:47.346 --> 00:59:49.288]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.748 --> 00:59:52.511]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:59.127 --> 01:00:03.329]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:04.770]  You want answers?
[01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:06.531]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:07.091 --> 01:00:10.693]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:11.294 --> 01:00:15.356]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.981 --> 01:00:27.182]  It feels like an avalanche of news and information, and that's because that's what it is.
[01:00:27.822 --> 01:00:29.923]  Everything is going into high gear right now.
[01:00:33.143 --> 01:00:51.348]  And I was going over the new FBI manual, where they say they're going to put surveillance teams on anybody they want without even probable cause, dig through household trash, that's a violation of the Fourth Amendment, plant tracker chips on your cars, you name it, and it's called the Domestic Investigations Operations Guide.
[01:00:52.368 --> 01:00:54.210]  And we have that dovetailed.
[01:00:54.231 --> 01:01:00.338]  I'm going to cover this coming up in the next segment with Bandera County Sheriff's Office issues domestic terrorism warning.
[01:01:01.019 --> 01:01:05.584]  Law enforcement agency concerned radical anti-government groups may be moving into the area.
[01:01:05.604 --> 01:01:09.288]  That means Americans that are awake that the feds have set up spy centers and are
[01:01:10.145 --> 01:01:13.107]  They're engaging in all sorts of crimes, and the government's run by foreign banks.
[01:01:13.127 --> 01:01:13.727]  They're looting us.
[01:01:14.288 --> 01:01:17.890]  If you try to warn people, they're going to start coming out now and trying to imply you're a terrorist.
[01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:20.292]  And they're announcing now, hey, we're calling you terrorists.
[01:01:20.312 --> 01:01:21.212]  We're going to spy on you.
[01:01:21.653 --> 01:01:22.653]  So you get scared.
[01:01:22.993 --> 01:01:23.974]  It's an intimidation.
[01:01:24.054 --> 01:01:24.735]  We're in the right.
[01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:25.695]  We're the good guys.
[01:01:26.035 --> 01:01:27.777]  We understand the crimes that have been committed.
[01:01:28.657 --> 01:01:35.802]  And they're now kicking into high gear, shifting out of, hey, the police state's for al-Qaeda, to no, it's for you people that like Ron Paul.
[01:01:36.402 --> 01:01:36.883]  Doesn't matter.
[01:01:37.643 --> 01:01:44.930]  Ron Paul last election cycle, and now I'm told it started up this election cycle, is getting the largest percentage of military donations of anybody else.
[01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:52.537]  In fact, three years ago, he got the majority of military donations, not just the largest percentage in the aggregate.
[01:01:52.577 --> 01:01:58.262]  So the good news is the cops and military are really waking up, and we're in a war right now to reach them and wake them up.
[01:01:58.302 --> 01:01:59.023]  So that's coming up.
[01:01:59.043 --> 01:02:01.205]  I have the Bandera County press release.
[01:02:04.327 --> 01:02:07.328]  And this is really, really dangerous stuff.
[01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:08.489]  So they're getting ready.
[01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:10.069]  You're Amish.
[01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:10.930]  You're trying to live on a farm.
[01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:11.950]  You're trying to be left alone.
[01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:13.451]  You want to kill cops.
[01:02:13.511 --> 01:02:16.912]  I mean, that's basically the message that they're telling police.
[01:02:17.052 --> 01:02:21.634]  And then the cops will start persecuting people, and then it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:02:22.174 --> 01:02:24.676]  Let's not let the globalists play us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:25.156 --> 01:02:25.376]  Okay?
[01:02:25.396 --> 01:02:26.276]  They know what they're doing.
[01:02:26.936 --> 01:02:27.897]  But I did get chills.
[01:02:29.301 --> 01:02:31.482]  reading this report out of the St.
[01:02:31.522 --> 01:02:33.283]  Louis SL Tribune.
[01:02:33.303 --> 01:02:34.044]  I believe that's the St.
[01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:34.624]  Louis Tribune.
[01:02:34.644 --> 01:02:37.566]  That's the New York Times republished in SL Trib.
[01:02:37.586 --> 01:02:41.988]  And we're going to be going over that report.
[01:02:42.028 --> 01:02:47.672]  It's also MSNBC, FBI agents get leeway to push privacy bounds.
[01:02:48.092 --> 01:02:52.995]  And also in the aftermath of that story, I want to talk about the aftermath of Bilderberg 2011.
[01:02:55.856 --> 01:03:05.632]  Also, right on time, as I've been telling you in the last year, every time they try to pass the Cybersecurity Act in the last four years now, or is it three, there's massive cyber attacks right when they're trying to pass it.
[01:03:05.972 --> 01:03:09.478]  And Europe's trying to put government control hubs over the entire...
[01:03:10.532 --> 01:03:13.713]  infrastructure in Europe, so it's also happening there.
[01:03:14.493 --> 01:03:30.457]  Just like they've now had the genetically engineered E. coli outbreak in Europe coming to the U.S., and they of course have reintroduced the Food Safety Act, written by Big Agra, who's generally the culprit in most major problems in the food chain if you look up past cases, so they can start shutting down their competition.
[01:03:30.497 --> 01:03:36.179]  So the Monopoly men are working in overdrive right now.
[01:03:37.259 --> 01:03:41.383]  We'll also get into all the Middle East news and some of the good news.
[01:03:41.423 --> 01:03:47.589]  Stocks opened higher after six down weeks, CNBC's reporting, than some really bad news from CNBC.
[01:03:48.089 --> 01:03:48.449]  U.S.
[01:03:48.629 --> 01:03:51.012]  is even worse shaped financially than Greece.
[01:03:51.632 --> 01:03:57.438]  Gross says the head of Pemco, that's one of the biggest brokerage firms out there, but he talks about being in worse shape with $14.3 trillion.
[01:03:59.315 --> 01:03:59.515]  I think?
[01:04:30.415 --> 01:04:30.956]  Yeah, the U.S.
[01:04:30.996 --> 01:04:39.058]  is in bad shape because we bought into fractional reserve banking, which always ends in hyperinflation and debt defaults.
[01:04:39.578 --> 01:04:44.200]  And the Chinese, of course, on Friday came out and said the United States is already technically defaulting.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:52.663]  They're not officially doing it, but they're doing it by means of hyperinflation, which will now come home to roost here domestically.
[01:04:52.803 --> 01:04:53.283]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.444 --> 01:04:56.925]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:57.145 --> 01:05:02.187]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:05:02.447 --> 01:05:03.807]  Saving means to make money.
[01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:12.771]  The Calbin Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:13.511 --> 01:05:20.613]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:21.053 --> 01:05:28.655]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:33.957]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:34.277 --> 01:05:36.457]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091.

[01:05:54.926 --> 01:06:09.404]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:06:10.405 --> 01:06:14.089]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:15.089 --> 01:06:27.078]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:06:27.839 --> 01:06:35.125]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:06:35.805 --> 01:06:45.409]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:49.450]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:53.212]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:58.033]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:58.353 --> 01:06:58.953]  Number one.
[01:06:59.253 --> 01:07:02.414]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:02.674 --> 01:07:03.254]  Number two.
[01:07:03.554 --> 01:07:08.095]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:08.435 --> 01:07:08.875]  It's true.
[01:07:09.175 --> 01:07:13.736]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:14.056 --> 01:07:14.596]  Number three.
[01:07:14.876 --> 01:07:18.157]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:18.457 --> 01:07:22.158]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:22.378 --> 01:07:22.919]  Number 4.
[01:07:23.159 --> 01:07:25.522]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:25.922 --> 01:07:29.306]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:29.606 --> 01:07:30.147]  Number 5.
[01:07:30.407 --> 01:07:34.311]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:34.552 --> 01:07:39.317]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:43.618]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:45.319]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:45.539 --> 01:07:47.620]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:51.001]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:52.882 --> 01:08:01.885]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:02.485 --> 01:08:05.526]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.286 --> 01:08:07.267]  Coming up, the
[01:08:08.769 --> 01:08:15.912]  Ron Paul of Switzerland, Dominique Betting, a member of Parliament there, who did march up and try to get into Bilderberg, will be joining us.
[01:08:17.113 --> 01:08:25.256]  One of the most prominent conservative politicians in Italy also tried to go in and force his way through and had his face slammed to the ground.
[01:08:25.276 --> 01:08:29.338]  A member of the European Union Parliament, of the European Union government.
[01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:33.460]  And the Italian government has launched a big investigation, filed formal complaints.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:36.341]  It's a diplomatic row, as they call it.
[01:08:37.962 --> 01:08:42.471]  Over there, headline, MEP assaulted by Bilderberg security to take legal action.
[01:08:42.511 --> 01:08:43.032]  So it happened.
[01:08:43.072 --> 01:08:43.774]  They marched on it.
[01:08:43.794 --> 01:08:45.377]  We're going to be breaking...
[01:08:46.542 --> 01:09:00.310]  All of the huge developments down and why this is such a big deal and the fact that globally the dam is officially broken on media cover-ups, dinosaur media cover-ups of Bilderberg at the very tip-top of the global government pyramid.
[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:06.093]  These are the people setting the nightmare planetary agenda known as the New World Order, so that's coming up.
[01:09:06.593 --> 01:09:11.236]  But right now, let me get into this report as we start the second hour here.
[01:09:12.844 --> 01:09:15.128]  And this, of course, is one of the top stories up on Drudge.
[01:09:16.029 --> 01:09:18.694]  It's also up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:09:19.195 --> 01:09:22.320]  FBI expands agents' investigative power.
[01:09:22.841 --> 01:09:24.744]  Well, that doesn't sound too scary, does it?
[01:09:25.802 --> 01:09:27.543]  And they have a link to the new manual here.
[01:09:28.324 --> 01:09:33.968]  And it goes on, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is given significant new powers in a manual.
[01:09:34.508 --> 01:09:36.009]  It's not a law, it's just a manual.
[01:09:36.850 --> 01:09:44.475]  And it's roughly 14,000 agents and all their auxiliary spies, allowing them more leeway to search databases.
[01:09:45.546 --> 01:09:47.188]  That means your computer without warrants.
[01:09:47.528 --> 01:09:56.376]  Go through household trash, you heard that right, or use surveillance teams to scrutinize, and that's the million private contractors they hire.
[01:09:56.916 --> 01:09:58.058]  Oh, it's private teams, yeah.
[01:09:58.878 --> 01:10:08.347]  Or go through household trash or use surveillance teams to scrutinize the lives of people who have attracted their attention.
[01:10:09.828 --> 01:10:10.829]  And it goes on to say,
[01:10:12.711 --> 01:10:14.652]  No judge, no jury, no probable cause.
[01:10:14.992 --> 01:10:16.113]  Just if they feel like it.
[01:10:16.133 --> 01:10:21.456]  And of course the Patriot Act says sneak and peek, where they break in your house and you never know they were there.
[01:10:22.236 --> 01:10:25.078]  Digging through your trash, breaking in your house, no reason to do it.
[01:10:25.398 --> 01:10:26.779]  That is the Stasi.
[01:10:26.799 --> 01:10:28.059]  That's as bad as it gets.
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.021]  Wasn't even routine in the Soviet Russia, but the East Germans did it.
[01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:34.483]  And who did the Homeland Security hire eight years ago?
[01:10:34.943 --> 01:10:35.823]  Marcus Wolff.
[01:10:36.304 --> 01:10:39.886]  Two years in a row, million dollar contract, 1.1 million each year.
[01:10:40.708 --> 01:10:42.969]  When I first heard about that eight and a half years ago, I didn't believe it.
[01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:46.872]  And I went in and looked up the federal funding order that was public.
[01:10:47.232 --> 01:10:56.458]  Kind of like Houston Chronicle reported when Halliburton got three one million man camp contracts for FEMA camps in America for American citizens.
[01:10:57.947 --> 01:11:01.128]  Houston Chronicle, right there in the Federal Purchase Directives.
[01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:03.349]  They're putting bids out for it, Halliburton got it.
[01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:10.873]  It continues, the FBI soon plans to issue the new edition of its manual called the Domestic Investigations and Operation Guide.
[01:11:11.253 --> 01:11:20.837]  According to an official, not a servant, an official, who has worked on the draft document and several others, and they have sections of it here, who have been briefed on its contents, the new rules
[01:11:21.497 --> 01:11:34.521]  Add to several measures taken over the past decade to give agents more latitude as they search for signs, search for signs, pre-crime, as they search for signs of criminal or terrorist activity.
[01:11:35.141 --> 01:11:37.962]  Not, oh, we're getting a bite on the line, now we investigate.
[01:11:38.022 --> 01:11:39.683]  No, just, no more Fourth Amendment.
[01:11:40.023 --> 01:11:43.224]  After all the TSA is sticking their hands down your pants, we're just going to do this.
[01:11:46.533 --> 01:11:50.415]  The FBI recently briefed several privacy advocates about the coming changes.
[01:11:50.555 --> 01:12:09.726]  Among them, Michael German, a former FBI agent who is now a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, argued it was unwise to further ease restrictions on agents' power to use potentially intrusive techniques, especially if they lacked a firm reason to suspect someone of wrongdoing.
[01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.987]  And they also do public intimidation.
[01:12:13.688 --> 01:12:15.589]  You have an anti-war rally in Austin?
[01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:22.223]  Scores of people, and some of them videotaped it, FBI just come to the door and say, why were you at that rally against the war?
[01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:25.085]  Are you planning to do something bad?
[01:12:25.105 --> 01:12:25.946]  Do you know any terrorists?
[01:12:26.026 --> 01:12:27.367]  And they're like, no, I'm against the war.
[01:12:28.027 --> 01:12:29.729]  Then I went later and saw footage of the rally.
[01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:31.870]  Just anti-war rally.
[01:12:32.191 --> 01:12:35.113]  They're like, well, we're here to talk to you about why you went to an anti-war rally.
[01:12:35.553 --> 01:12:37.095]  Do you know about any terrorist plans?
[01:12:38.868 --> 01:12:39.669]  Can we come in?
[01:12:40.329 --> 01:12:41.770]  And it's all meant to scare you.
[01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:47.435]  And folks, if America gives in to this fear, they know that teachers stormed the Texas Capitol two weeks ago.
[01:12:47.795 --> 01:12:49.376]  We stormed it days before that.
[01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:51.058]  They followed our example.
[01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:55.882]  We followed the Wisconsin example on whatever political side of the paradigm you are.
[01:12:57.045 --> 01:12:58.946]  The system wants to scare you.
[01:12:59.266 --> 01:13:00.886]  The system wants a chilling effect.
[01:13:00.926 --> 01:13:02.087]  And if you give in to that, it's over.
[01:13:02.447 --> 01:13:03.167]  Continuing here.
[01:13:03.667 --> 01:13:05.628]  The long, dark night begins, folks.
[01:13:06.008 --> 01:13:10.189]  If you're like, oh, I better not talk about freedom, the ADL will attack me.
[01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:13.931]  I better not talk about the Constitution or how I like Ron Paul.
[01:13:14.131 --> 01:13:17.332]  Folks, we are the majority of people that are active in the country.
[01:13:17.972 --> 01:13:27.221]  We're not the majority of Americans, but of people awake and active politically, every metric shows what they call a super-patriot is just an American.
[01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:32.186]  I'm pro-gun, I'm pro-family, I'm pro-private property, I'm against the private Federal Reserve.
[01:13:32.266 --> 01:13:32.906]  Oh, you're evil.
[01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:33.867]  Well, you know what?
[01:13:33.887 --> 01:13:38.011]  85% of Americans in major polls want to abolish or audit the Fed, so I guess
[01:13:39.056 --> 01:13:45.522]  Well, they call you kooks and conspiracy theorists if you think that the government may have been involved in killing JFK.
[01:13:45.883 --> 01:13:47.464]  Well, over 90% in the average poll.
[01:13:47.524 --> 01:13:49.987]  So, go ahead and tell us we're dangerous terrorists.
[01:13:50.067 --> 01:13:50.807]  We're the majority.
[01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:51.468]  We're on the right.
[01:13:51.868 --> 01:13:54.871]  Your buffalo job, your intimidation job isn't going to work.
[01:13:56.533 --> 01:13:57.174]  And it goes on.
[01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:09.109]  Claiming additional authority to investigate people only further raises the potential for abuse, Chairman said, pointing to complaints about the Bureau's surveillance of domestic political advocacy groups like Ron Paul.
[01:14:10.109 --> 01:14:15.411]  Ron Paul has been by the Army and by the FBI.
[01:14:15.512 --> 01:14:16.912]  I mean, Ron Paul himself!
[01:14:18.153 --> 01:14:20.374]  How dare the 75-year-old doctor?
[01:14:20.714 --> 01:14:21.874]  Man, he's evil.
[01:14:21.894 --> 01:14:22.695]  We've got to watch him.
[01:14:22.715 --> 01:14:25.016]  He's actually a real American.
[01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:31.391]  And he went on to point out the fact that they targeted Mosque.
[01:14:31.671 --> 01:14:39.133]  I notice how the media always says Mosque, because political correctness still allows people to go after Muslims.
[01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:40.694]  So the idea is, ooh, they're a real threat.
[01:14:41.194 --> 01:14:42.835]  Let the FBI go after the Muslims.
[01:14:43.155 --> 01:14:49.737]  The point is, again, over 90% of this stuff is for gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, regardless of your religious bent.
[01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:59.239]  It goes on, some of the most notable changes apply to the lowest category of investigations called an assessment.
[01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:13.407]  The category created in December of 08 allows agents, because they have a manual that says so, to look into people and organizations proactively and without firm evidence for suspecting criminal or terrorist activity.
[01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.049]  This is the FBI in churches.
[01:15:18.089 --> 01:15:24.473]  This is the FBI going to the land rights organizations or FBI going to...
[01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:26.890]  Gun rights rallies.
[01:15:27.071 --> 01:15:28.011]  And I've been at these.
[01:15:28.111 --> 01:15:29.572]  And it's obviously an FBI agent.
[01:15:29.912 --> 01:15:30.853]  It's the classic type.
[01:15:30.893 --> 01:15:31.633]  Six foot four.
[01:15:31.753 --> 01:15:32.233]  Clean cut.
[01:15:32.253 --> 01:15:33.214]  Looks like Clark Kent.
[01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:34.895]  And they go, Alex, come here.
[01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:37.336]  Alex, you want to attack cops with me tomorrow?
[01:15:37.356 --> 01:15:39.757]  And I'm like, are you with the FBI?
[01:15:39.797 --> 01:15:41.198]  Or are you a federal marshal?
[01:15:41.498 --> 01:15:42.999]  You guys have assessed me years ago.
[01:15:43.819 --> 01:15:46.100]  You know I'm not planning anything violent.
[01:15:46.581 --> 01:15:49.282]  I mean, it was your bosses staged Oklahoma City.
[01:15:49.342 --> 01:15:50.123]  And that's what I tell them.
[01:15:50.403 --> 01:15:52.344]  I go, I'm not going to blow things up like your bosses did.
[01:15:53.064 --> 01:16:00.872]  I didn't test that Ryder truck six months before at the B-A-T-F-E testing range in New Mexico.
[01:16:01.532 --> 01:16:03.254]  I didn't test the Ryder truck like they did.
[01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.337]  I didn't get the warning to go to work that day like your people did.
[01:16:06.857 --> 01:16:07.878]  And then you'll kind of shake them up.
[01:16:07.918 --> 01:16:09.940]  I'll go, oh, you know about that, don't you?
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:10.681]  No, don't worry.
[01:16:10.721 --> 01:16:12.122]  I'm not going to blow anything up like you are.
[01:16:13.544 --> 01:16:14.805]  Hey, get over here, camera guy.
[01:16:14.825 --> 01:16:15.686]  We're going to follow this guy.
[01:16:15.706 --> 01:16:16.967]  And they're like, boom, out of there.
[01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:21.631]  No, no, I'm not doing that, okay?
[01:16:21.851 --> 01:16:22.371]  I'm sorry.
[01:16:22.391 --> 01:16:30.094]  I don't target daycares like your bosses do and like your bosses are getting ready to do again.
[01:16:30.114 --> 01:16:41.899]  I don't put out multiple White House advisor memos and then put it out to Democratic fundraisers in letters saying that Alex Jones and Glenn Beck are going to cause a new Oklahoma City.
[01:16:43.083 --> 01:16:47.505]  I mean, even Glenn Beck had to come out and say, they're preparing to blame me, Glenn Beck, for the new Oklahoma City.
[01:16:47.545 --> 01:16:51.807]  And then he played the clips, where they said, it'd be so great if we had a new Oklahoma City.
[01:16:52.067 --> 01:16:53.448]  That sure helped us last time.
[01:16:53.788 --> 01:16:55.208]  Gee, can't we have another one?
[01:16:55.408 --> 01:16:55.809]  Please?
[01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:56.749]  Please, Obama?
[01:16:57.349 --> 01:17:10.315]  They think we're so dumb that in the Financial Times of London and public memos, they, multiple top Democratic strategists say, if Obama doesn't have a big terror attack like Oklahoma City, he's done.
[01:17:14.912 --> 01:17:31.058]  I mean, I have to sit here and watch these people getting ready to do what they're gonna do, so they can then say, well, I heard those people didn't like the Federal Reserve, but, you know, after they blew up the Chicago Tower, or whatever they're planning, you know, after that happened...
[01:17:32.058 --> 01:17:35.200]  We just can't talk bad about the banksters anymore.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.322]  It's the only card they've got.
[01:17:37.802 --> 01:17:49.829]  And the point I'm getting to here is they're getting ready to roll out publicly what's been going on since and before 9-11 that this whole anti-terror apparatus is for real Americans.
[01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:52.551]  People that really know what it is to be an American.
[01:17:52.811 --> 01:17:54.652]  People that really stand for true freedom.
[01:17:56.594 --> 01:17:59.896]  People who are opposed to the criminal corporate takeover
[01:18:01.523 --> 01:18:02.324]  Of America.
[01:18:02.664 --> 01:18:03.445]  Of the Republic.
[01:18:03.965 --> 01:18:04.546]  It's happened.
[01:18:04.786 --> 01:18:05.527]  They're looting us.
[01:18:05.867 --> 01:18:06.607]  We're waking up.
[01:18:06.868 --> 01:18:07.949]  We're saying we don't like it.
[01:18:08.229 --> 01:18:10.210]  And they're going to stage terror attacks.
[01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:13.233]  It's the only card they got to blame it on us.
[01:18:14.534 --> 01:18:19.098]  And I'm risking my life here to bring you this information and to tell you this information.
[01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:20.779]  Yeah, this is not fun.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:21.840]  This is survival.
[01:18:22.441 --> 01:18:23.482]  This is doing the right thing.
[01:18:24.903 --> 01:18:26.144]  You're like, well wait, you said it's dangerous.
[01:18:26.184 --> 01:18:26.925]  How is it survival?
[01:18:27.345 --> 01:18:28.066]  Not for me!
[01:18:30.097 --> 01:18:35.298]  You see, I'm not perfect, but I've got that basic instinct of a man to protect my tribe.
[01:18:35.778 --> 01:18:59.142]  The first thing they do is train you to only care about yourself, so you can be broken down and isolated by the structure, so that you don't have a family, so that you don't have any morals, you don't have any compass to stand up for, so that the fake plastic corporate culture can be superimposed over what it was to be human, so that we can be rendered castrated.
[01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:01.520]  Now, I'm going to go to break.
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:04.343]  When I come back, I'm going to get into even bigger news.
[01:19:04.424 --> 01:19:10.030]  But, going through your trash, for no reason, no warrant, not even a suspicion, pre-crime.
[01:19:10.391 --> 01:19:13.194]  Tapping your phones, no warrant, no nothing, pre-crime.
[01:19:14.196 --> 01:19:15.597]  Brain scanners in the airports.
[01:19:16.498 --> 01:19:18.819]  At sports stadiums.
[01:19:18.859 --> 01:19:20.360]  They announced it three years ago.
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.380]  Now they're getting ready to roll it out.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:22.461]  Big mobile trucks.
[01:19:22.481 --> 01:19:24.182]  We're going to put you in this brain scanner.
[01:19:24.682 --> 01:19:25.582]  It says you're lying.
[01:19:26.322 --> 01:19:29.904]  Just science fiction, beyond 1984, all here.
[01:19:30.404 --> 01:19:34.006]  And the people that run the FBI are the folks that are staging the terror attacks.
[01:19:34.466 --> 01:19:40.149]  And Oklahoma City, if you haven't looked into Oklahoma City being an inside job, you need to.
[01:19:41.448 --> 01:19:46.173]  The federal documents have even been released, proving much of how they carried it out.

[01:23:57.861 --> 01:24:15.373]  The FBI agent who got out of the FBI because of all the big police state developments was actually interviewed in Ventura's police state episode that I consulted on and also appeared in, Michael German, and he agrees in the piece that the threat fusion centers are the federalization
[01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:17.631]  We're good to go.
[01:24:34.602 --> 01:24:38.203]  But for sake of argument, let's say Al-Qaeda's real, you know, they're horrible and evil.
[01:24:38.523 --> 01:24:43.025]  The point is that you go look at the infrastructure, the training, it's all about the American people.
[01:24:43.465 --> 01:24:46.506]  So they're using the threat of Al-Qaeda to take our rights.
[01:24:46.646 --> 01:24:47.766]  Now, no one can debate that.
[01:24:49.387 --> 01:24:50.387]  This is up on the Drudge Report.
[01:24:50.427 --> 01:24:51.707]  It's also up at Infowars.com.
[01:24:51.747 --> 01:24:54.088]  I'm going to get Kurt and Emma to do a detailed report on it.
[01:24:54.108 --> 01:24:57.089]  I'm going to cover it more in the third hour, but I'm taking your calls.
[01:24:58.449 --> 01:25:02.911]  Bandera County Sheriff's Office issues domestic terror warning.
[01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:07.854]  And they say we've got domestic terrorism right here at our doorstep.
[01:25:08.315 --> 01:25:13.180]  Now you'd think in Texas when I first saw the headline this morning at like 6 a.m.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:21.909]  I thought well they must finally be admitting that tens of thousands of deaths and the kidnappings that the drug cartels are terrorists and that Texas is in trouble.
[01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:24.351]  Sure enough though it was
[01:25:25.816 --> 01:25:28.418]  That these groups don't believe in the Federal Reserve.
[01:25:28.479 --> 01:25:29.600]  They don't like the government.
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:30.741]  You mean the illegitimate government?
[01:25:31.241 --> 01:25:32.402]  And here's the Sheriff's Department.
[01:25:32.422 --> 01:25:34.444]  We have domestic terrorism right here on our doorstep.
[01:25:34.845 --> 01:25:35.425]  No attacks.
[01:25:35.505 --> 01:25:36.066]  No bombings.
[01:25:36.466 --> 01:25:37.187]  Nothing illegal.
[01:25:39.229 --> 01:25:41.230]  But, oh, it's the sovereign citizen.
[01:25:41.911 --> 01:25:44.594]  And some people say, well, I don't claim I don't need a driver's license.
[01:25:44.614 --> 01:25:45.054]  They don't care.
[01:25:45.434 --> 01:25:46.976]  They call that one group of terrorists.
[01:25:46.996 --> 01:25:48.657]  You're not a terrorist not having a driver's license.
[01:25:48.898 --> 01:25:49.959]  The illegal aliens don't have them.
[01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:56.201]  We've got like 20-something states saying no to the federalized ID under REAL ID Act because it's unconstitutional.
[01:25:56.501 --> 01:26:00.023]  The Brits won't accept an ID card because they know that it's Big Brother.
[01:26:00.043 --> 01:26:08.886]  You know, the point is that they expand out from that to got a Ron Paul sticker, love the founding fathers, talk about the Constitution a lot.
[01:26:08.906 --> 01:26:11.247]  I mean, we've got the training manuals, we've published them.
[01:26:12.068 --> 01:26:12.688]  It's bizarre.
[01:26:12.728 --> 01:26:13.569]  Have cell phones.
[01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:14.489]  Wear blue jeans.
[01:26:14.749 --> 01:26:16.410]  Have camera equipment in their home.
[01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:17.911]  Don't talk a lot at work.
[01:26:18.171 --> 01:26:19.252]  Keep their desk locked.
[01:26:19.632 --> 01:26:20.672]  It's basically everybody.
[01:26:20.692 --> 01:26:22.053]  They're saying, don't trust anybody.
[01:26:22.253 --> 01:26:23.574]  The Walmart telescreens.
[01:26:23.634 --> 01:26:24.674]  Tattle on your neighbors.
[01:26:25.355 --> 01:26:26.555]  Why are they gearing up for this?
[01:26:26.595 --> 01:26:28.116]  Because we're going into a depression.
[01:26:28.436 --> 01:26:29.857]  They're going to trigger terror attacks.
[01:26:30.217 --> 01:26:31.978]  Clamp down their political opposition.
[01:26:33.584 --> 01:26:36.085]  Who understands what's happening to America.
[01:26:36.505 --> 01:26:54.513]  So the fact that they're pre-hyping all this now, and all over the country, not just Texas, saying these Patriot people are about to strike, that's because the Feds are telling the locals that to get them scared to run under the Feds' dark wings when this happens, when it's the Feds and their private contractors that are staging it.
[01:26:56.530 --> 01:27:04.035]  Let's go ahead and play part of this local newscast where they sit there with a straight face talking about the evil American sovereign citizens.
[01:27:04.055 --> 01:27:04.355]  Here it is.
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:12.683]  The Bandera County Sheriff's Office issuing a warning to citizens about an anti-government movement known for acts of domestic terrorism.
[01:27:13.123 --> 01:27:21.847]  Followers of the Sovereign Citizens Movement have been known to carry out violent acts, including killing law enforcement officers and other public servants.
[01:27:22.267 --> 01:27:29.290]  The Sheriff's Office tells our Tim Gerber the warning was prompted by the recent shooting death of Bexar County Sheriff's Deputy Kenneth Vann.
[01:27:31.190 --> 01:27:33.492]  We have domestic terrorism right at our doorstep.
[01:27:33.812 --> 01:27:41.437]  Captain Charlie Hicks said while there is no evidence the death of Kenneth Vann has any links to the sovereign citizens, it's the same type of crime followers are known for.
[01:27:41.897 --> 01:27:49.522]  Last May in West Memphis, Arkansas, a father and his teen son opened fire on two police officers with an assault rifle during a routine traffic stop.
[01:27:49.862 --> 01:27:51.543]  The officers were killed in that shootout.
[01:27:51.603 --> 01:27:54.805]  The father and son died in a second shootout with officers.
[01:27:54.865 --> 01:27:59.308]  That's our main concern is citizens' safety and police officers' safety in this area.
[01:27:59.707 --> 01:28:12.654]  Hicks says followers share the belief that the 14th Amendment tricked Americans into becoming citizens of the United States, offering them privileges such as driver's licenses and other government benefits, which act as hidden contracts through which Americans gave up their sovereignty.
[01:28:13.074 --> 01:28:15.436]  Followers are often very vocal about their beliefs.
[01:28:15.902 --> 01:28:17.783]  They're very, very serious in their beliefs.
[01:28:18.303 --> 01:28:22.846]  And very serious when they do go to violence.
[01:28:23.326 --> 01:28:25.367]  You know, they'll kill you in a New York minute.
[01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:33.751]  Hicks says while a training camp for similar anti-government groups was discovered in Kerr County in the past, there is no evidence any members are operating in Bandera County.
[01:28:33.991 --> 01:28:34.251]  Okay.
[01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:35.572]  Citizens should still be cautious.
[01:28:35.572 --> 01:28:36.453]  Let's stop right there.
[01:28:36.553 --> 01:28:42.362]  So if you want the rest of the story, as Paul Harvey would say, what did I tell you two years ago?
[01:28:42.402 --> 01:28:43.344]  What did I tell you a month ago?
[01:28:44.045 --> 01:28:49.853]  They're going to have to the local police and to your cell phones, local radio, you name it, the new alert system.
[01:28:49.893 --> 01:28:51.195]  And they always had this planned.
[01:28:52.128 --> 01:28:54.548]  First, they train you about terror alerts nationally.
[01:28:55.289 --> 01:29:02.530]  Then, they deliver them to the locals because they found that will create more fear and more chatter because folks don't believe national news.
[01:29:03.090 --> 01:29:05.770]  People don't believe government nationally.
[01:29:06.231 --> 01:29:07.751]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[01:29:08.291 --> 01:29:12.992]  So now, the new terror alerts, and this is admitted, are delivered locally.
[01:29:13.212 --> 01:29:17.713]  Now, no proof, no nothing, nothing going on, but my gosh, look out, there's terrorists.
[01:29:17.753 --> 01:29:18.233]  Who are they?
[01:29:18.253 --> 01:29:19.253]  They're the sovereign citizens.
[01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:30.942]  Then they'll have local meetings with the FBI and others at the Rotary Club, at the 4-H Club, telling them they don't like the Federal Reserve.
[01:29:30.982 --> 01:29:32.083]  They don't like the UN.
[01:29:32.103 --> 01:29:33.904]  They're like, well, my brother does that.
[01:29:34.564 --> 01:29:35.685]  Your brother's a terrorist.
[01:29:36.365 --> 01:29:40.408]  So see, this is the secret police takeover, and that cop's a useful idiot.
[01:29:40.428 --> 01:29:41.288]  You can just look at him.
[01:29:41.529 --> 01:29:42.709]  He actually believes this.
[01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.771]  He's not sophisticated enough to see the side.
[01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:45.631]  We're on the march.
[01:29:46.112 --> 01:29:47.613]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.633 --> 01:29:51.435]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.837 --> 01:30:00.261]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[01:30:01.501 --> 01:30:06.264]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[01:30:06.645 --> 01:30:13.429]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:15.370 --> 01:30:17.231]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[01:30:19.417 --> 01:30:21.676]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:30:23.857 --> 01:30:27.718]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[01:30:28.438 --> 01:30:31.539]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[01:30:32.279 --> 01:30:33.079]  Others don't.
[01:30:33.499 --> 01:30:35.400]  We turn jeans inside out.
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:37.160]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:40.001]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:30:59.603 --> 01:31:00.864]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[01:31:57.983 --> 01:31:58.903]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:59.263 --> 01:32:02.944]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:02.964 --> 01:32:05.405]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:05.425 --> 01:32:10.866]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[01:32:11.286 --> 01:32:17.508]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:17.948 --> 01:32:23.491]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:32:23.892 --> 01:32:27.594]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:28.094 --> 01:32:32.077]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:32.397 --> 01:32:37.900]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.302]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:32:41.902 --> 01:32:43.323]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:43.864 --> 01:32:44.304]  It's here.

[01:33:12.267 --> 01:33:15.248]  We are joined today by Dominique Betting.
[01:33:15.828 --> 01:33:19.109]  He is a prominent member of the Swiss Parliament.
[01:33:20.109 --> 01:33:25.230]  He represents the canton of Jura and is a psychiatrist by profession.
[01:33:26.210 --> 01:33:30.031]  He played a key role in successfully blocking a visit by former U.S.
[01:33:30.091 --> 01:33:38.813]  President George W. Bush to the country in February 2011, lobbying the federal prosecutor's office to have him arrested, stemming from war crime charges.
[01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:40.634]  He followed another
[01:33:42.418 --> 01:33:43.719]  Finally, to have former U.S.
[01:33:43.759 --> 01:33:49.783]  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger arrested for the European arrest warrant out of France, betting.
[01:33:51.044 --> 01:33:58.449]  Also, of course, attempted to confront and did confront and tried to get into the Bilderberg conference of which Kissinger was attending.
[01:33:59.617 --> 01:34:08.786]  And you can find him on the Swiss version of Facebook, betting spelled B-A-E-T-T-I-G.
[01:34:09.586 --> 01:34:12.149]  And, of course, we also have the other report here.
[01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:20.837]  We have the video up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com of Mr. Betting, a parliamentarian betting
[01:34:22.205 --> 01:34:31.229]  Uh, going up and delivering letters and talking to the security at Bilderberg the night before, a member of European Parliament assaulted by Bilderberg security.
[01:34:31.689 --> 01:34:43.055]  And now the Italian government says they're going to take legal action on the member of the European Union Parliament from Italy, a conservative politician who had his face slammed to the ground, Mr. Borgheseo.
[01:34:43.795 --> 01:34:44.215]  Thank you.
[01:34:44.235 --> 01:34:44.455]  Thank you.
[01:35:10.242 --> 01:35:15.026]  OK, first I have to apologize because I speak English very bad.
[01:35:15.046 --> 01:35:23.354]  And second, Bilderberg represent for me the worst that could happen.
[01:35:23.374 --> 01:35:29.820]  A big number of foreign bankers, foreign politicians,
[01:35:30.785 --> 01:35:38.990]  The farmer and other people, we work together without any transparency and without to be elected.
[01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:43.813]  And they want to meet secretly in my country.
[01:35:44.433 --> 01:35:48.195]  And some politicians of my country were also involved in that.
[01:35:48.735 --> 01:35:57.420]  And we were very afraid that they could discuss about the future of my country, about my bank, my front, my neutrality.
[01:35:59.005 --> 01:36:18.896]  My freedom of speech, Switzerland is still an island of freedom in Europe and the world, and this meeting represents something which is dangerous for free expression of mind and free enterprise, free democracy.
[01:36:21.204 --> 01:36:21.885]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:36:22.506 --> 01:36:27.170]  If you can, Member of Parliament Dominic Betting, just speak right into your telephone for us.
[01:36:27.190 --> 01:36:31.955]  You're a bit muffled, but we are able to hear what you're saying, joining us from Switzerland.
[01:36:32.996 --> 01:36:37.080]  Specifically, we have gotten documents out of Bilderberg, and we have Schwartz's inside Bilderberg.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.781]  It has been on their agenda.
[01:36:39.622 --> 01:36:49.826]  Try to force Switzerland into the Euro, but I've seen polls at Swiss Info, one of your big national publications, that over 80% of Swiss do not want to be part of the Euro.
[01:36:50.426 --> 01:36:55.528]  And I also saw polls recently that close to 80% are very angry at Bilderberg.
[01:36:55.908 --> 01:36:59.550]  Why do you think they chose Switzerland as a place to meet?
[01:36:59.610 --> 01:37:01.931]  Because it's one of the few countries they haven't wrecked?
[01:37:01.951 --> 01:37:05.052]  Everybody else is rioting because of their banking takeovers?
[01:37:06.927 --> 01:37:07.668]  Probably, yes.
[01:37:07.748 --> 01:37:18.255]  They chose Switzerland because Switzerland is still resistant against this new world disorder.
[01:37:18.975 --> 01:37:24.279]  And we are afraid what could happen with our independence, with our money.
[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:29.323]  The two former meetings in Europe were in Greece and in Spain.
[01:37:30.185 --> 01:37:35.029]  You know now exactly what is happening with Greece and Spain's economy.
[01:37:35.129 --> 01:37:36.410]  They have big problems, sir.
[01:37:37.110 --> 01:37:48.039]  And I'm afraid that this Build-A-Bear meeting in my country would mean big problems for my country, for my economy, for my freedom, for my welfare.
[01:37:49.344 --> 01:38:03.609]  Absolutely, the London Guardian is reporting that the Google boys were there looking and also trying to crack down on web freedom and we see at the very same time public meetings in the Euro talking about censoring the web and Sarkozy of France is the leader of that.
[01:38:03.929 --> 01:38:06.350]  There's no doubt these are a group of authoritarians.
[01:38:09.251 --> 01:38:10.752]  Yes, I heard about that.
[01:38:12.693 --> 01:38:17.014]  They will try to censor the web and of course it's a problem for me.
[01:38:17.555 --> 01:38:18.475]  I'm afraid of that.
[01:38:20.097 --> 01:38:21.720]  Well, this is unprecedented, sir.
[01:38:22.341 --> 01:38:28.233]  I have never heard or seen anything like this in the 35 years that there's been coverage.
[01:38:28.854 --> 01:38:30.557]  Bilderberg has obviously been around for 60 or more.
[01:38:32.355 --> 01:38:51.686]  But this really is unprecedented, what we're seeing happen right now, to have a member of the European Union Parliament attacked and bloodied, and that's now confirmed, official government complaint and EU complaint, and also have yourself and two other parliamentarians show up and deliver letters.
[01:38:51.946 --> 01:38:54.028]  Can you tell us first off what you think of
[01:38:54.808 --> 01:39:05.322]  The confirmed reports of the Italian European Parliament member being violently assaulted by security guards outside the site of the Elitist Bilderberg Conference at the Serrata Hotel in St.
[01:39:05.382 --> 01:39:10.789]  Moritz, and the fact that the Italian government and Swiss Info is reporting has lodged an official complaint.
[01:39:12.501 --> 01:39:12.781]  Yes.
[01:39:13.282 --> 01:39:13.923]  It's a shame.
[01:39:14.143 --> 01:39:21.250]  It's a shame that a European Parliament member could not go in this hotel at this night.
[01:39:21.851 --> 01:39:24.474]  I can't understand that.
[01:39:24.794 --> 01:39:26.476]  It's a shame for my country.
[01:39:26.956 --> 01:39:28.858]  It's a shame for the freedom of speech.
[01:39:29.299 --> 01:39:35.125]  And it means that this conference has the right of quasi-territoriality and
[01:39:36.235 --> 01:39:45.202]  It's also a shame that I couldn't, as a Swiss politician, as a member of the Swiss Parliament, I couldn't go in this hotel to talk with the participants.
[01:39:45.282 --> 01:39:46.323]  I cannot understand that.
[01:39:46.623 --> 01:39:47.204]  It's incredible.
[01:39:48.725 --> 01:39:50.126]  What happened when you went up to the front?
[01:39:50.146 --> 01:39:55.230]  I mean, there's footage of it, but the police made our cameras stay back 30 yards or so.
[01:39:56.891 --> 01:40:01.035]  What was discussed when you went up a few nights ago?
[01:40:01.055 --> 01:40:05.058]  It was a Saturday evening, around midnight, and talked to the security people?
[01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:13.036]  The idea was first to have a contact with the security, to ask them if everything is alright.
[01:40:13.677 --> 01:40:21.962]  I can understand that probably this policeman didn't agree with the fact that this conference was third, but okay.
[01:40:22.582 --> 01:40:23.703]  The chief was not there.
[01:40:23.723 --> 01:40:31.228]  We tried to ask them to make the chief, the superintendent, come to speak with us, but nobody comes.
[01:40:31.268 --> 01:40:33.890]  They said we have to come tomorrow morning.
[01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:47.532]  My idea was to discuss with them and to ask them the rights to go in the hotel and probably to have a glass in the bar and have the opportunity to talk with the participants, but of course it was impossible.
[01:40:48.233 --> 01:40:52.497]  Such an idea was impossible to realize, impossible to go in.
[01:40:53.177 --> 01:40:57.281]  They answered me, without accreditation you can't go in, sir, it's impossible.
[01:40:57.796 --> 01:41:01.199]  Well, I'm all for free association and people being able to have private events.
[01:41:01.739 --> 01:41:06.103]  The problem, as you know, sir, and I've looked at the Swiss law, you have the equivalent of the Logan Act.
[01:41:06.503 --> 01:41:07.404]  We have a Logan Act.
[01:41:07.844 --> 01:41:10.386]  We had sitting Secretary of Defense there confirmed.
[01:41:11.187 --> 01:41:13.588]  We have other government leaders from your government meeting there.
[01:41:13.668 --> 01:41:14.769]  It's illegal in your country.
[01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:16.351]  It's illegal in our country.
[01:41:16.991 --> 01:41:19.333]  And the fact is that they're in there setting policy.
[01:41:19.813 --> 01:41:24.917]  They even had the German minister on video that we first posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:41:24.937 --> 01:41:26.358]  The Drudge Report's linked to it right now.
[01:41:28.224 --> 01:41:35.045]  Where the German minister and others were caught outside and they were confronted by German speakers and they said, you're in there setting agendas.
[01:41:35.326 --> 01:41:36.166]  And he said, that's right.
[01:41:36.446 --> 01:41:38.746]  It's none of your business what agendas we're setting.
[01:41:39.046 --> 01:41:41.427]  But we've gotten the minutes out before by our spies.
[01:41:41.747 --> 01:41:45.508]  They are in there making deals with our elected representatives.
[01:41:45.568 --> 01:41:46.908]  I mean, this is outrageous.
[01:41:47.248 --> 01:41:48.908]  This is not a private meeting.
[01:41:49.408 --> 01:41:52.209]  They're setting government policy and that's why you have a law against it.
[01:41:52.489 --> 01:41:57.450]  Are you going to call for criminal investigations of Swiss members of government that were inside?
[01:42:00.001 --> 01:42:02.442]  Yes, I agree completely with you.
[01:42:02.482 --> 01:42:03.062]  It's a shame.
[01:42:03.582 --> 01:42:07.763]  It's a shame, but we had the first success.
[01:42:10.083 --> 01:42:18.145]  It was written in the press and in the papers, and it was the first time probably that people could know what is happening in this country.
[01:42:18.705 --> 01:42:22.446]  And I shall go on to ask other questions and to
[01:42:25.414 --> 01:42:30.258]  Inform people about what probably happened in that conference.
[01:42:30.278 --> 01:42:31.599]  It was a great danger.
[01:42:33.361 --> 01:42:49.654]  All those important people from foreign governments are probably talking about war in Libya, are probably talking about ways how to break national economy of other countries.
[01:42:50.194 --> 01:42:52.356]  And it's not a private meeting, of course.
[01:43:01.684 --> 01:43:19.152]  Sir, have you heard about the march because they discovered Saturday evening into Sunday morning that it was June 12th, David Rockefeller's birthday and so literal villagers with torches saying that it's for your birthday came with a cake for Rockefeller and chanted at the gates.
[01:43:19.692 --> 01:43:20.573]  Have you seen that footage?
[01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:24.630]  You know, I don't know anything about it.
[01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:39.654]  Well, it's quite an archetypal image, and of course they didn't do anything violent, and that's good, but the video, David Rockefeller and his birthday cake, is the video up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43:40.174 --> 01:43:43.114]  They normally leave Sunday evening or Monday morning.
[01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:43.914]  A lot of them stay.
[01:43:44.554 --> 01:43:51.696]  Jim Tucker, who's covered for 35 years, said that they left very early, and that some even left Saturday via helicopter, and this hasn't been seen before.
[01:43:52.176 --> 01:43:53.577]  Sorry, I didn't understand your question.
[01:43:53.597 --> 01:43:58.818]  Probably it was not so nice for them to be in the spot of interest.
[01:44:22.224 --> 01:44:44.254]  And we're showing some video right now later in the video or perhaps as the first it shows them marching down through the night with the torches very very powerful archetypal scene like something out of
[01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:53.903]  The novel Frankenstein has the townspeople want the monster out of their town.
[01:44:54.323 --> 01:45:08.050]  Now, going back to the day before you arrived, Member of Parliament Betting from Switzerland, you wrote a letter in German, and we translated it, because the police were shoving people around and being very aggressive initially.
[01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:10.851]  They did behave themselves after you sent a letter.
[01:45:11.131 --> 01:45:13.732]  You sent a letter to the police chief and others.
[01:45:13.792 --> 01:45:14.973]  What did you tell them in that letter?
[01:45:18.211 --> 01:45:32.801]  I told them that they should have to, how to say that, to make less control, to leave people go free in this city and the middle of the hotel.
[01:45:33.261 --> 01:45:42.647]  It was not possible so that the policemen had to control people who were just walking on the road.
[01:45:43.068 --> 01:45:44.309]  And I asked them to
[01:45:45.433 --> 01:45:51.338]  To have it cool and to stay back as much as possible.
[01:45:52.038 --> 01:45:54.180]  And it probably was successful.
[01:45:56.377 --> 01:45:58.538]  Well, I mean, you've got to be proud of Switzerland.
[01:45:58.558 --> 01:46:03.542]  You guys marched up there and got in their face, something our representatives have never done when they meet here in the U.S.
[01:46:03.562 --> 01:46:04.242]  every four years.
[01:46:05.223 --> 01:46:09.526]  The member of the EU Parliament from Italy got bloodied.
[01:46:09.906 --> 01:46:13.388]  That's now become a big diplomatic incident all over the Italian news.
[01:46:13.708 --> 01:46:15.289]  Their government is hopping mad.
[01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:17.110]  That's going on.
[01:46:17.551 --> 01:46:25.596]  And it's literally, in hundreds of European papers, dozens here show the dam has broken on the Bilderberg cover-up.
[01:46:31.047 --> 01:46:49.621]  Probably it was a big step in terms of progress and they will know now that it's not so good to come to Switzerland and there are more and more people, right and left wing people, who feel concerned about the fact that this
[01:46:50.405 --> 01:46:50.826]  I think so.
[01:47:09.375 --> 01:47:11.917]  It's not good that such a meeting happened in Switzerland.
[01:47:11.937 --> 01:47:13.478]  Switzerland is a free country.
[01:47:14.138 --> 01:47:18.180]  An independent and direct democratic country.
[01:47:18.621 --> 01:47:23.844]  And it was a shame that such a meeting, a discreet meeting,
[01:47:28.712 --> 01:47:30.292]  Well, I hardly agree with you, sir.
[01:47:31.453 --> 01:47:36.234]  But again, it does send a serious message to these people that decades ago they could hide the secret.
[01:47:36.614 --> 01:47:42.376]  Now more and more they're being exposed and they are the authors of the economic implosion happening worldwide.
[01:47:42.416 --> 01:47:43.136]  That's on record.
[01:47:43.736 --> 01:47:50.678]  And more and more they're being identified, not their puppet politicians and real statesmen like yourself and Ron Paul and others.
[01:47:50.938 --> 01:47:53.679]  I'm told folks in Switzerland, a lot of them like Ron Paul.
[01:47:57.662 --> 01:47:59.003]  Sorry, I didn't understand.
[01:47:59.764 --> 01:48:01.005]  Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:48:01.125 --> 01:48:06.890]  I'm told that folks know of Ron Paul and a lot of people in Switzerland like Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:10.213]  I know Ron Paul.
[01:48:10.313 --> 01:48:11.734]  I appreciate this politician.
[01:48:12.374 --> 01:48:14.336]  Do you mean he will come to Switzerland?
[01:48:15.217 --> 01:48:15.537]  No, no.
[01:48:15.617 --> 01:48:21.022]  I mean, I just heard from my crew that was there that a lot of Swiss talked favorably about Ron Paul.
[01:48:24.534 --> 01:48:31.399]  Well, in closing, sir, from your research, what is this world government wanting to set up?
[01:48:37.303 --> 01:48:53.315]  My first concern is that my money of Switzerland and the reserve of gold of banks of Switzerland could be used to save the economy of Greece, of Portugal,
[01:48:54.413 --> 01:48:57.256]  I'm very anxious with that.
[01:48:59.638 --> 01:49:08.685]  The fact that there is war now in Libya and probably tomorrow in Syria or Iran is also a concern for me.
[01:49:08.725 --> 01:49:13.389]  I want to be neutral in this affair.
[01:49:14.350 --> 01:49:20.655]  And also, I know that such people are discussing about all the new technologies
[01:49:21.623 --> 01:49:37.433]  Global technologies, industrial technologies, we make people independent from, how to say that, from external needs.
[01:49:37.954 --> 01:49:43.597]  They try also to organize campaigns with flu and oxides.
[01:49:44.358 --> 01:49:49.081]  They play with fear of catastrophe and
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:55.944]  It means that people will have no choice if they will be one side or not.
[01:49:56.324 --> 01:50:04.450]  A big danger, a big coordination of mass movement against freedom of everybody.
[01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:06.251]  This is a problem.
[01:50:06.638 --> 01:50:20.848]  Yeah, for those that may have missed exactly what you said, but tell me if I'm correct, you're saying there is an organized psychological warfare operation using the threat of the flu, wars, terrorism, you're saying staged, to menace us into giving up our rights?
[01:50:20.868 --> 01:50:21.549]  Is that what you just said?
[01:50:25.609 --> 01:50:26.489]  All right, stay there, sir.
[01:50:26.670 --> 01:50:27.810]  One final segment.
[01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:29.511]  I want to talk to you off-air during the break.
[01:50:29.531 --> 01:50:30.812]  We'll come back with just five minutes.
[01:50:31.172 --> 01:50:34.874]  On the other side, European Union Member of Parliament Dominique Betting.
[01:50:34.914 --> 01:50:43.739]  He's a psychiatrist, and you heard him talk about problem-reaction-solution, how they're going to use staged bio-attacks, staged terror, to take down Switzerland.
[01:50:43.819 --> 01:50:44.839]  And you bet they're going to try.
[01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:46.920]  They've already taken down America.
[01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:52.203]  They're getting ready to mop up the resistance right now with a rollout of the domestic terrorism push.
[01:50:52.744 --> 01:50:53.124]  Stand by.
[01:50:56.661 --> 01:50:58.342]  Are you still a traditional smoker?
[01:50:58.743 --> 01:51:03.446]  Now experience a new lifestyle and try vaping with e-cigarettes by Lecig.
[01:51:03.867 --> 01:51:07.550]  Imagine no ashes, stains, nasty smell or coughing and hacking.

[01:51:47.972 --> 01:51:50.615]  Spelled L-E-C-I-G.com.
[01:51:50.835 --> 01:51:53.839]  Lecig e-cigarettes for today's modern smoker.
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:58.345]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[01:51:58.665 --> 01:51:59.286]  Number one.
[01:51:59.587 --> 01:52:02.751]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:03.492]  Number two.
[01:52:03.852 --> 01:52:08.416]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:52:08.736 --> 01:52:09.196]  It's true.
[01:52:09.476 --> 01:52:14.060]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:14.900]  Number 3.
[01:52:15.181 --> 01:52:18.463]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:52:18.763 --> 01:52:22.466]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:52:22.686 --> 01:52:23.247]  Number 4.
[01:52:23.487 --> 01:52:25.848]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:52:26.249 --> 01:52:29.631]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:52:29.932 --> 01:52:30.132]  Number 5.
[01:52:30.692 --> 01:52:34.614]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:52:34.835 --> 01:52:39.617]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:54:06.028 --> 01:54:09.569]  And no folks, we're not talking about LeBron James here today.
[01:54:10.690 --> 01:54:13.751]  The last time I did a LeBron James video, Drudge linked to it and it got 600,000 views.
[01:54:16.035 --> 01:54:22.758]  Maybe I should talk about LeBron James and how it's a big distraction and his egomania is a symptom of what's happened in this country.
[01:54:23.178 --> 01:54:29.221]  People need to stop tattooing chosen one on their backs and need to start actually trying to build a better society.
[01:54:29.821 --> 01:54:38.365]  But that is the big news in America today, not the plunging economy, but that LeBron James is saying, hey, you know, my life's better than your life, I'm a sore loser.
[01:54:39.806 --> 01:54:41.667]  But we won't really be talking too much about that.
[01:54:41.687 --> 01:54:45.351]  I've got really a lot of other key news coming up in the next hour and your phone calls.
[01:54:45.391 --> 01:54:46.271]  I'll open the phones up.
[01:54:46.772 --> 01:54:56.080]  But going back to a Swiss member of parliament, also a psychiatrist, Dominic Betting, who I'm told is kind of the Ron Paul over there, very popular, very prominent.
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:55:04.287]  Hopefully he'll run for prime minister and get in there so he can defend his country as a statesman against these people.
[01:55:05.268 --> 01:55:15.638]  I heard in there what you were getting into about using stage crises and problem reaction events, Reichstag events, to take over Switzerland.
[01:55:15.658 --> 01:55:18.580]  The same thing is being done here in America.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:23.084]  They're teaching people now that if you're against Bilderberg or the Federal Reserve, you're a terrorist.
[01:55:23.485 --> 01:55:25.346]  But then they say there's no evidence of violence.
[01:55:26.147 --> 01:55:29.189]  From the Alex Jones, Ron Paul people, but we're bad.
[01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:31.651]  And so that's very creepy.
[01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.692]  Do they try to do that in Switzerland?
[01:55:33.712 --> 01:55:38.235]  Does any of your media demonize people, sir, that are against the New World Order?
[01:55:38.675 --> 01:55:42.158]  If you're not a traitor, do they go after you for standing up for Switzerland?
[01:55:44.031 --> 01:55:54.034]  Yes, the idea is to say that people who are talking or asking questions about Bilderberg Group are conspirationists.
[01:55:54.594 --> 01:56:02.637]  It means that people who are crazy, who think there is a big plot in the world and they try to discredit us like that.
[01:56:02.737 --> 01:56:04.858]  It's a big idea.
[01:56:04.918 --> 01:56:07.179]  We are special people, crazy people.
[01:56:07.279 --> 01:56:08.079]  We believe in
[01:56:08.957 --> 01:56:17.061]  In plot theories all around the world, it's very difficult to have the courage to ask questions.
[01:56:17.121 --> 01:56:21.063]  Because also in my party, many people said, oh, don't do that.
[01:56:21.103 --> 01:56:23.224]  You will be labeled as a conspiration.
[01:56:23.244 --> 01:56:27.166]  That's not good for you, for your mental health, for your political health.
[01:56:27.766 --> 01:56:28.987]  And that's the idea.
[01:56:29.687 --> 01:56:30.508]  We are crazy.
[01:56:31.468 --> 01:56:34.910]  We are people who think that the world is
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:43.143]  But sir, isn't it the opposite?
[01:56:43.163 --> 01:56:44.583]  I mean, you're a psychiatrist.
[01:56:45.304 --> 01:56:46.584]  We're the ones that aren't crazy.
[01:56:47.064 --> 01:56:49.766]  Bilderberg members have written books bragging about global government.
[01:56:50.146 --> 01:56:54.227]  The Financial Times has written admitting it's authoritarian but for our own good.
[01:56:54.247 --> 01:56:57.188]  They admit they, quote, want green fascism.
[01:56:57.869 --> 01:57:03.311]  They openly are pushing unelected bureaucracies, controlling
[01:57:03.911 --> 01:57:04.472]  Exactly, yes.
[01:57:04.492 --> 01:57:05.173]  Yes.
[01:57:05.193 --> 01:57:06.614]  We could do it this time with other people.
[01:57:06.634 --> 01:57:06.895]  We could do
[01:57:24.787 --> 01:57:31.812]  The fact to ask questions to the government and the press was obliged to talk about that.
[01:57:32.613 --> 01:57:34.154]  I mean, it's a big success.
[01:57:34.695 --> 01:57:36.416]  We could also ask questions with
[01:57:37.416 --> 01:57:41.359]  The fact that Switzerland is democracy, direct democracy, it's very important.
[01:57:41.479 --> 01:57:44.242]  It's the cultural policy in my country.
[01:57:44.542 --> 01:57:47.705]  People else is the last word in the government.
[01:57:47.905 --> 01:57:50.687]  Each people has their last word.
[01:57:51.247 --> 01:57:58.914]  And the fact that big, rich, foreign people can meet without people have the right to know what is happening.
[01:57:59.034 --> 01:58:00.535]  It's not good in our tradition.
[01:58:00.831 --> 01:58:08.615]  Well, that's why you're so wealthy and so free, because you are whippersnappers when it comes to freedom, and you're in there in their face.
[01:58:08.675 --> 01:58:11.537]  And you dominated media coverage, your points got out.
[01:58:11.617 --> 01:58:15.018]  Mainstream media is starting to say, yeah, Bilderberg is sinister.
[01:58:15.859 --> 01:58:20.101]  The Bilderberg guys got caught out and surrounded and said, yeah, we do have an agenda.
[01:58:20.141 --> 01:58:20.881]  None of your business.
[01:58:21.221 --> 01:58:22.382]  So we showed their arrogance.
[01:58:22.442 --> 01:58:24.283]  I'll say bye to you during the break, but we'll let you go.
[01:58:25.724 --> 01:58:29.826]  Member of Parliament in Switzerland, Dominique Betting, we really appreciate you joining us.
[01:58:30.106 --> 01:58:31.288]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:31.348 --> 01:58:32.170]  Tons of key news.
[01:58:32.190 --> 01:58:32.691]  Stay with us.
[01:58:35.936 --> 01:58:37.799]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:45.424 --> 01:58:46.926]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:47.146 --> 01:58:52.172]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[01:58:52.452 --> 01:58:53.814]  Saving means to make money.
[01:58:53.994 --> 01:59:02.764]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:59:03.505 --> 01:59:10.609]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:59:11.029 --> 01:59:18.653]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:59:19.033 --> 01:59:23.955]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[02:00:03.932 --> 02:00:04.732]  You want answers?
[02:00:05.512 --> 02:00:06.433]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:07.053 --> 02:00:10.714]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:11.254 --> 02:00:15.316]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:19.133 --> 02:00:33.710]  Okay, uh, I do want to... Sometimes when you're too close to something, it's hard afterwards to really go over the aftermath of it and properly put it in context, but I do want to run through some of the big Bilderberg news coming up later in the hour.
[02:00:35.302 --> 02:00:39.905]  But we need to continue the discussion of the new FBI manual.
[02:00:40.245 --> 02:00:46.910]  And it says, we'll go through your trash, we'll tap you without warrants, we'll spy on you, we'll break into your house without warrants.
[02:00:47.511 --> 02:00:49.052]  And yeah, it has nothing to do with Al Qaeda.
[02:00:49.572 --> 02:00:52.074]  If you don't like the Federal Reserve gang raping you, we're coming.
[02:00:52.634 --> 02:00:54.455]  Well, they can't get everybody.
[02:00:54.495 --> 02:00:57.356]  They can't stop everybody from speaking out and saying no.
[02:00:58.096 --> 02:01:01.218]  And we're at a big crossroads here right now.
[02:01:01.258 --> 02:01:08.141]  We're at a huge, huge crossroads right now where the system
[02:01:10.555 --> 02:01:11.975]  Knows that we're waking up.
[02:01:12.075 --> 02:01:15.216]  They know that we're identifying their criminal activities.
[02:01:16.456 --> 02:01:19.877]  They know that the awakening is exponential.
[02:01:20.637 --> 02:01:25.178]  And so, undoubtedly, I believe the system is going to stage terror attacks in America.
[02:01:28.679 --> 02:01:33.280]  And the next wave will be a mixture of foreign attacks and domestic.
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:35.360]  It'll all really be globalist launched.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:38.641]  And so after I take some calls, I'm going to go back over that, but
[02:01:39.734 --> 02:01:50.161]  You need to understand, if you tuned in last hour and you heard me talk about this for about 10 minutes, and I said, here's the rest of the story, please understand, none of that was my opinion.
[02:01:51.642 --> 02:01:56.225]  It's 100% a rollout, an incremental takeover of society.
[02:01:56.485 --> 02:01:58.126]  It's always more, more, more, more, more.
[02:01:58.467 --> 02:02:01.389]  And everything they always add on, every month, every year,
[02:02:02.881 --> 02:02:10.549]  to the secret police network was announced before 9-11 by the Rand Corporation and others of what they were going to build.
[02:02:10.969 --> 02:02:13.792]  So it's the fact that it's all an architecture designed.
[02:02:14.072 --> 02:02:15.093]  I've got the blueprints.
[02:02:15.474 --> 02:02:16.755]  I'm telling you what's coming next.
[02:02:17.095 --> 02:02:20.379]  I always know what's going to come next because I'm watching them.
[02:02:21.047 --> 02:02:23.128]  Okay, I have their blueprint.
[02:02:23.508 --> 02:02:40.053]  So it's like if I had the blueprints and I was watching a house being built down the street from my home, and I could sit there in my front window, you know, eating biscuits and mustard like Sling Blade, and I'm watching them and I go, well, the plans say they're going to lay the foundation now.
[02:02:40.113 --> 02:02:46.815]  The plans say that north wall is going to go up next, and then they're going to put in the second floor, and then they're going to put in the plumbing.
[02:02:47.978 --> 02:02:48.939]  They're going to put in the electrical.
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.724]  I'm sitting here watching it being built.
[02:02:53.146 --> 02:02:56.611]  And to newbies who don't study geopolitical systems, who don't study
[02:02:59.161 --> 02:03:04.925]  The current military industrial complex ruling class, you know, they hear somebody saying, yeah, you know the government's plans.
[02:03:04.965 --> 02:03:06.206]  You know what they're rolling out.
[02:03:06.586 --> 02:03:07.787]  You know what they're going to do next.
[02:03:08.248 --> 02:03:09.789]  They just can't even believe it.
[02:03:10.289 --> 02:03:12.531]  A, because they weren't listening years ago when I laid it all out.
[02:03:13.171 --> 02:03:17.014]  B, because they can't imagine that someone knows all about this.
[02:03:17.614 --> 02:03:18.435]  Listen, I'll be honest.
[02:03:19.616 --> 02:03:25.820]  I watch people that are basketball fans or golf fans or fans of
[02:03:27.557 --> 02:03:31.179]  Complex card games, like Bridge or something.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.863]  And it's like, man, they really know all the subtle nuances and all the rules of this.
[02:03:36.303 --> 02:03:37.884]  This looks really complex.
[02:03:38.264 --> 02:03:43.688]  But then once you actually try to play the game and start watching and start studying it, then you think, well, why didn't I know that all along?
[02:03:44.568 --> 02:03:51.213]  If we can have a mass understanding of what's going on, a mass awakening,
[02:03:52.182 --> 02:03:55.210]  We're really going to be able to turn the corner against tyranny worldwide.
[02:03:55.792 --> 02:04:00.384]  Now I want to open the phones up but I want to open them up for specific people.
[02:04:01.676 --> 02:04:10.003]  And then tomorrow we'll have wide open phones for everybody who were in Switzerland or were Americans or Brits or others who went to the Bilderberg Conference.
[02:04:10.604 --> 02:04:13.887]  I want to hear from you about what you saw on the ground, what you thought.
[02:04:14.467 --> 02:04:15.748]  Do you think this is historical?
[02:04:16.249 --> 02:04:17.269]  When we come back from break.
[02:04:17.650 --> 02:04:21.973]  I'll probably take four or five of those and then towards the end of the hour if we have time I'll open it up for general calls.
[02:04:21.993 --> 02:04:22.634]  1-800-259-9231 800-259
[02:04:29.099 --> 02:04:33.801]  9231.
[02:04:29.359 --> 02:04:33.801]  I forget the toll number for folks that can't call 1-800-OUT-OF-EUROPE.
[02:04:33.881 --> 02:04:34.321]  I forget that.
[02:04:34.341 --> 02:04:36.601]  I'll look it up during the break and give it out on the other side.
[02:04:37.102 --> 02:04:37.702]  But 800-259-9231.
[02:04:37.722 --> 02:04:46.844]  I just want to say great job to the 300, 400 or so the news reported that ended up showing up to the demonstration.
[02:04:46.884 --> 02:04:49.765]  That's a lot to go to the middle of nowhere on short notice.
[02:04:49.785 --> 02:04:50.605]  So great job.
[02:04:50.886 --> 02:04:51.746]  We'll be back with more news.
[02:04:51.766 --> 02:04:52.086]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.363 --> 02:04:58.586]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:04:58.906 --> 02:04:59.527]  Number one.
[02:04:59.827 --> 02:05:02.969]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:05:03.250 --> 02:05:03.830]  Number two.
[02:05:04.110 --> 02:05:08.654]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:05:08.994 --> 02:05:09.454]  It's true.
[02:05:09.734 --> 02:05:14.298]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:05:14.618 --> 02:05:15.178]  Number three.
[02:05:15.439 --> 02:05:18.721]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:05:19.021 --> 02:05:22.724]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:05:22.924 --> 02:05:23.485]  Number 4.
[02:05:23.725 --> 02:05:26.087]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:05:26.487 --> 02:05:29.871]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:05:30.171 --> 02:05:30.711]  Number 5.
[02:05:30.952 --> 02:05:34.875]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:05:35.095 --> 02:05:39.860]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:44.166]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:44.326 --> 02:05:45.888]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:05:46.108 --> 02:05:48.171]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:05:48.371 --> 02:05:50.715]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.

[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:00.901]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[02:06:09.729 --> 02:06:12.571]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[02:06:12.931 --> 02:06:13.872]  Are you kidding me?
[02:06:14.052 --> 02:06:20.098]  For the cost of one greasy, fast-food, super-sized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.

[02:06:55.745 --> 02:06:59.386]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:06:59.706 --> 02:07:07.828]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:08.568 --> 02:07:12.609]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:24.011]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:24.651 --> 02:07:33.653]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:34.153 --> 02:07:39.214]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:39.595 --> 02:07:46.756]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:47.076 --> 02:07:49.837]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:07:54.847 --> 02:07:57.055]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:57.617 --> 02:08:00.427]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:12.154 --> 02:08:33.156]  If you were at Bilderberg 2011, we're leaving the phone lines open for you for a couple of segments to give us your take on the criminal global elite, many of which have written books individually admitting they want to set up a tyrannical world government, a global carbon tax, the end of national sovereignty, the end of individual private property, the end of internet freedom.
[02:08:34.197 --> 02:08:35.258]  This is their policy.
[02:08:35.298 --> 02:08:36.198]  This is what they want.
[02:08:36.218 --> 02:08:38.000]  This is what they admit they want to do.
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:47.005]  And their overdriving policy is world population reduction, founded by the Nazi Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, whose wife was the Queen of the Netherlands.
[02:08:47.285 --> 02:08:51.828]  His daughter is the head of Bilderberg today, along with Etienne Davignon, the Viscount.
[02:08:52.909 --> 02:08:54.930]  Now, here's the toll number.
[02:08:55.010 --> 02:08:59.573]  It's not toll-free, because folks overseas, unless they're calling on Skype, can't call toll-free.
[02:09:01.817 --> 02:09:01.877]  1-651-695-7777.
[02:09:01.897 --> 02:09:01.957]  1-651-695-7777.
[02:09:01.997 --> 02:09:10.862]  Or if you're in Europe and want to comment about the austerity the Bilderberg Group is bringing in, raising your taxes, cutting your benefits to pay them money on debts they created, 6-5-1-6...
[02:09:22.308 --> 02:09:22.729]  9-5-7-7-7-7.
[02:09:24.711 --> 02:09:26.412]  Your country code into the U.S.
[02:09:26.452 --> 02:09:29.575]  Our country code is 6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7.
[02:09:30.136 --> 02:09:40.305]  But I want to play the audio and the video of the exclusive footage that great activists there handed off to Aaron and Aaron Dykes who did just a fabulous job there.
[02:09:40.666 --> 02:09:41.747]  Also the crew here at home.
[02:09:42.107 --> 02:09:43.769]  Couldn't do it without them working as a team.
[02:09:44.489 --> 02:09:49.032]  God, this video has been up on Drudge now through The One and Guardian for two days.
[02:09:49.432 --> 02:09:50.593]  Hundreds of thousands of views.
[02:09:51.033 --> 02:09:56.857]  RT has now gotten a hold of some footage from Luke Werdowski, who was also there, and it's even a little bit clearer than our footage.
[02:09:57.377 --> 02:10:02.120]  I got a lot of emails and saw a lot of comments saying, why is some of your footage not zooming in and out?
[02:10:02.540 --> 02:10:04.261]  Why is your footage a little bit blurry?
[02:10:05.482 --> 02:10:13.647]  Well, because we were shooting it on Apple iPhones, live, and transmitting it up to Justin.TV.
[02:10:15.219 --> 02:10:17.139]  And people complain about ads on Justin.TV.
[02:10:17.420 --> 02:10:18.500]  We don't get any of that.
[02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:23.101]  We ought to sign up and find out if we should.
[02:10:23.121 --> 02:10:24.381]  3,500,000 views on Justin.TV.
[02:10:25.322 --> 02:10:26.522]  It was a test account we had.
[02:10:26.542 --> 02:10:27.402]  We never really used.
[02:10:28.002 --> 02:10:32.823]  And it's gotten over 3,500,000 views in the last four or five days.
[02:10:33.164 --> 02:10:38.185]  So just an example of the power of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:10:39.185 --> 02:10:42.027]  But it's blurred because it's not high-res.
[02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:46.109]  It's low-res video that was pumped out over the cell phone networks.
[02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:48.550]  And we bought a phone that would work in Switzerland.
[02:10:49.471 --> 02:10:52.552]  And then the guys called me and said, well, the data package ran out.
[02:10:53.233 --> 02:10:57.115]  And now it's basically $500 per two-minute video.
[02:10:57.135 --> 02:10:58.095]  And I said, keep going.
[02:10:58.316 --> 02:10:59.676]  Well, the guys did keep going.
[02:11:00.137 --> 02:11:01.717]  And it looks like the bill is going to be upwards of $10,000.
[02:11:01.757 --> 02:11:03.258]  So that's $10,000 of money we blew.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:08.621]  To bring you the footage, to have it first.
[02:11:08.641 --> 02:11:15.604]  Because sure, we can shoot video, go cut it out, encode it, load it, try to get it over the hotel's slow internet and not get it out.
[02:11:15.664 --> 02:11:15.824]  No.
[02:11:16.084 --> 02:11:17.925]  We were shooting live on the ground.
[02:11:18.245 --> 02:11:21.306]  So yes, that's why it's a little bit blurry, but it's still quite clear.
[02:11:21.346 --> 02:11:24.828]  You know, it looks like the internet video did, look, six, seven years ago.
[02:11:25.188 --> 02:11:27.549]  We're so used to really high res on the web now.
[02:11:28.670 --> 02:11:30.510]  But that is a point I need to call AT&T.
[02:11:32.282 --> 02:11:35.406]  And try to get the bigger data package now, maybe retroactively.
[02:11:35.906 --> 02:11:42.955]  I forgot to tell the IT folks that here I am engaging behind the scenes stuff on air, just because I have absolutely no time.
[02:11:43.375 --> 02:11:48.040]  And I had to make the decision to spend all that money just to give you the live
[02:11:48.741 --> 02:11:49.101]  Instant
[02:12:06.854 --> 02:12:10.255]  The ski lifts up the top of the mountain to a resort up there.
[02:12:11.035 --> 02:12:14.816]  The police would not let our guys even get up there when they were there via the road.
[02:12:15.176 --> 02:12:17.016]  Whatever was going on up there was so special.
[02:12:17.497 --> 02:12:26.659]  And here comes the head of Google and others and British foreign ministers and German ministers and German Chinese ministers down the hill.
[02:12:27.776 --> 02:12:28.536]  I don't think so.
[02:13:01.676 --> 02:13:04.498]  One of the ministers says this is horrible when the crowd gets up there.
[02:13:08.623 --> 02:13:14.028]  They're talking to the German minister.
[02:13:34.744 --> 02:13:36.106]  They said, we don't like your secret agenda.
[02:13:36.126 --> 02:13:36.867]  Tell us what you're doing.
[02:13:36.927 --> 02:13:38.288]  And he goes, our agenda?
[02:13:38.308 --> 02:13:39.950]  The Guardian's translated it.
[02:13:41.132 --> 02:13:43.054]  We're discussing our agenda and it's none of your business.
[02:13:53.803 --> 02:13:57.166]  There's Lord Mandelson, heavily hated in England.
[02:13:57.246 --> 02:13:58.488]  There's the head of Google.
[02:13:59.408 --> 02:14:03.192]  And that's where he talks about, it's our agenda and it's none of your business.
[02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:16.631]  You've got government leaders of Germany, England, and others in the U.S.
[02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:20.173]  Robert Gates violated the Logan Act, the Defense Secretary, to meet at that.
[02:14:20.533 --> 02:14:22.014]  Hillary was fined over $300,000 for it in the mid-90s.
[02:14:26.926 --> 02:14:27.486]  Crank this up.
[02:14:44.978 --> 02:15:12.837]  Around about one half kilometer from up the hill down to the main resort and I recognized even Mr. Steinbrück who was the former financial minister of Germany and also of course the others recognized him and here again somebody came.
[02:15:14.998 --> 02:15:15.619]  Let them pass!
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:17.082]  We'll do it another way!
[02:15:17.202 --> 02:15:17.643]  Or not?
[02:15:17.663 --> 02:15:18.204]  Let them pass!
[02:15:27.228 --> 02:15:28.889]  Alright, and there's a lot more of it.
[02:15:28.909 --> 02:15:31.311]  Aaron will be back soon, but I've got to give him a few days off.
[02:15:31.371 --> 02:15:39.696]  I know Aaron, he won't want to be off, but to like boil down all this amazing footage we've got and pump it out to everybody at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:15:40.497 --> 02:15:44.380]  Again, we loaded the phone lines up from Europe last Friday when I did this.
[02:15:45.712 --> 02:15:50.477]  Um, and I do see some calls now coming in, but we're just taking calls from people that were there.
[02:15:50.497 --> 02:15:54.840]  Uh, or we can widen it to people in Europe to get your take on what's happened.
[02:15:54.861 --> 02:15:58.864]  Uh, the toll free number to join us, uh, dial the U S country code and then 651-695-7777.
[02:15:58.924 --> 02:16:00.305]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:06.931]  But big coverage!
[02:16:06.971 --> 02:16:16.017]  The London Guardian is the biggest paper, not just in England, but in Europe because English is the language, that's how the Europeans all communicate with each other, is with English.
[02:16:16.377 --> 02:16:26.624]  So most Europeans are bilingual and so the Guardian is conservatively the biggest paper in England and probably in Europe as well.
[02:16:27.604 --> 02:16:31.667]  Bilderberg 2011, Lord Mandelson's nature walk.
[02:16:32.107 --> 02:16:34.429]  Charlie Skelton looks on as Peter Mandelson
[02:16:35.999 --> 02:16:41.965]  And some billionaire buddies take the air at Bilderberg and he breaks it down and links to our footage of that.
[02:16:42.005 --> 02:16:45.729]  We appreciate the great reportage of Charlie Skelton there at Bilderberg 2011.
[02:16:46.049 --> 02:16:50.653]  We're probably going to be getting him on the show to pop in tomorrow.
[02:16:51.474 --> 02:16:52.255]  We also have AP.
[02:16:53.416 --> 02:17:04.024]  With the headline they reported on, they waited until Vildenberg had closed Sunday, and they had all basically fled early to run the headline, VIPs conspiracy theorist descend on Swiss resort.
[02:17:04.744 --> 02:17:15.192]  Yeah, you got members of Parliament, European Union Parliament, psychiatrists, doctors, media, they're wanting to know what's going on, and you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:17:15.732 --> 02:17:34.940]  You see, these are the same conspiracy theorists that knew this existed back when the AP made jokes about it a decade ago, not existing, but still, because they basically work for these people, they say, oh, VIPs, they're very important persons, but you are a conspiracy theorist.
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:42.603]  So, translated, wonderful, powerful, important humans and subhumans descend on Swiss Resort.
[02:17:43.323 --> 02:17:56.377]  And you heard the doctor earlier, when we had the member of the Swiss Parliament, Dr. Dominic Betting on, you heard him breaking down the fact that that's what they say, that if you ask questions, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:17:56.438 --> 02:17:58.019]  That's what a conspiracy theorist is.
[02:17:59.033 --> 02:18:08.639]  Oh sure, there are people who do theorize, who ask questions about maybe the sun is a fried egg, but they have no proof.
[02:18:09.419 --> 02:18:11.780]  We say politicians constantly lie.
[02:18:12.101 --> 02:18:13.141]  Power corrupts absolutely.
[02:18:13.161 --> 02:18:14.262]  Power corrupts absolutely.
[02:18:14.602 --> 02:18:16.543]  Powerful people get together and want more power.
[02:18:16.783 --> 02:18:18.504]  Here's all our evidence of Bilderberg.
[02:18:18.544 --> 02:18:20.645]  Here's our molds inside Bilderberg.
[02:18:20.986 --> 02:18:22.266]  Here's what their agenda is.
[02:18:22.306 --> 02:18:28.150]  We've been proven accurate year after year after year after year, and their intellectual answer to that is,
[02:18:28.550 --> 02:18:30.952]  You are a conspiracy theorist.
[02:18:35.055 --> 02:18:36.596]  And, you know, I kind of like this experience.
[02:18:36.676 --> 02:18:41.619]  I've never in 16 years of being on radio not had callers.
[02:18:42.860 --> 02:18:44.742]  Even, I mean, I can call from callers from Japan.
[02:18:45.786 --> 02:18:46.867]  And, uh, they call in.
[02:18:46.887 --> 02:18:48.948]  I can call from callers from Mexico, they call in.
[02:18:49.228 --> 02:18:49.929]  Load the lines.
[02:18:50.329 --> 02:18:59.215]  I guess because I'm going after such a small group, 300 or 400 people that actually went, uh, that they're either at work or, uh, haven't gotten home yet, so they're not calling in.
[02:18:59.235 --> 02:19:02.957]  I guess that is a small, small window of people to be able to call into the show.
[02:19:02.977 --> 02:19:10.101]  It is a elite minority of great folks that, uh, went and were part of history, really breaking the damn of the Bilderberg Group cover-up.
[02:19:10.122 --> 02:19:12.123]  This is the beginning of the fall of Bilderberg.
[02:19:12.923 --> 02:19:14.565]  And so I'll just open the general phones up.
[02:19:14.585 --> 02:19:14.785]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:19:14.805 --> 02:19:14.965]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:19:15.025 --> 02:19:23.912]  And we'll get you up and on the air on any issue you wish to discuss.
[02:19:23.932 --> 02:19:26.354]  But this Bilderberg thing is very, very exciting.
[02:19:26.895 --> 02:19:29.997]  Now, obviously, I'm going to be talking more about this in the days to come.
[02:19:30.017 --> 02:19:34.221]  But if you just joined us, really chilling news that we knew was coming.
[02:19:34.921 --> 02:19:36.963]  But it's very, very upsetting.
[02:19:37.644 --> 02:19:46.875]  FBI expands agents' investigative power to dig through your trash without warrants, break into your house, wiretap you, and spy on you.
[02:19:47.375 --> 02:19:51.300]  And that dovetails with all the announcements about, oh, these right-wing patriots.
[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:51.780]  They're everywhere.
[02:19:51.820 --> 02:19:52.741]  They're about to attack.
[02:19:53.082 --> 02:19:54.063]  That's in the news today.
[02:19:54.443 --> 02:19:56.806]  What would you do with a check for $25,000?
[02:19:56.966 --> 02:20:02.091]  What if you could eliminate all of your credit card debt in 90 days and keep all of your money?
[02:20:02.291 --> 02:20:12.562]  Hi, I'm Jason Davenport, and I've just completed ZeroDebt100.com, a program that stops and prevents debt collections of all kinds, including debt collectors and foreclosures, with guaranteed results.
[02:20:12.782 --> 02:20:14.023]  Forget loan modifications.
[02:20:14.103 --> 02:20:20.308]  Zero Debt showed me how to get the banks to pay my property taxes and insurance while stopping my foreclosure without paying one dime.
[02:20:20.468 --> 02:20:25.732]  An attorney tried to garnish my wages but the court denied his request because of what I filed from the Zero Debt program.
[02:20:25.913 --> 02:20:29.876]  Find out how I did this by calling Zero Debt today at 800-477-9256.
[02:20:31.277 --> 02:20:38.623]  Tell them Jason sent you and ask for the Zero Debt special and the free bonus promotion about stopping an IRS levy and getting your money back.
[02:20:38.783 --> 02:20:40.304]  Tell them Jason sent you and call 800-477-9256.
[02:20:40.324 --> 02:20:40.364]  800-477-9256.
[02:20:40.424 --> 02:20:40.604]  That's 800-477-9256.

[02:20:41.424 --> 02:20:46.247]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:46.347 --> 02:20:46.747]  Number one.
[02:20:59.773 --> 02:21:03.756]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:21:04.056 --> 02:21:08.620]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:09.400]  It's true.
[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:15.104]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:21:15.405 --> 02:21:18.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:21:18.987 --> 02:21:22.670]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:21:22.890 --> 02:21:23.431]  Number 4.
[02:21:23.671 --> 02:21:26.033]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:21:26.433 --> 02:21:29.817]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:21:30.117 --> 02:21:30.337]  Number 5.
[02:21:30.918 --> 02:21:34.841]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:21:35.061 --> 02:21:39.826]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:21:54.301 --> 02:21:57.263]  Most Americans believe famine and hunger will never happen.
[02:21:57.583 --> 02:21:59.084]  But what if... Day 1.
[02:21:59.504 --> 02:22:01.265]  Mayhem breaks out at grocery stores.
[02:22:01.926 --> 02:22:02.446]  Day 3.
[02:22:02.886 --> 02:22:05.187]  Families are on edge.
[02:22:05.248 --> 02:22:05.848]  Day 5.
[02:22:06.288 --> 02:22:07.529]  The neighbors come knocking.
[02:22:08.189 --> 02:22:08.730]  Day 10.
[02:22:09.350 --> 02:22:11.831]  Small bands of thieves begin stealing at gunpoint.
[02:22:12.652 --> 02:22:13.412]  Day 15.
[02:22:13.953 --> 02:22:17.635]  Desperation, but the government can't help because there's no food left.
[02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:24.056]  Introducing the Grab and Go Emergency Food Supply from Solutions from Science.

[02:22:54.889 --> 02:22:58.031]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:22:58.251 --> 02:23:06.275]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.

[02:23:23.243 --> 02:23:24.304]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:23:24.484 --> 02:23:28.867]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:23:29.047 --> 02:23:34.731]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:23:34.851 --> 02:23:38.273]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:23:38.493 --> 02:23:41.095]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:41.215 --> 02:23:46.118]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:23:46.278 --> 02:23:46.499]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:46.519 --> 02:23:47.920]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:00.588 --> 02:24:15.758]  I'm gonna do a special report On the article out of Bandera, Texas Because it's so important And I'm gonna cover that more tomorrow
[02:24:17.247 --> 02:24:21.450]  But this is the new terror threat alert system.
[02:24:21.951 --> 02:24:22.691]  Not my opinion.
[02:24:22.752 --> 02:24:28.977]  Remember, I told you it was going to be individual alerts to towns and cities that would then be fear-mongered as if they were real.
[02:24:30.006 --> 02:24:38.553]  And it's now admitted, Homeland Security tells thousands of counties all over the country, and now hundreds, the Bandera one got picked up by drugs, so folks know about that, in Texas.
[02:24:38.573 --> 02:24:40.175]  But this is all over the news.
[02:24:40.815 --> 02:24:48.361]  The police chiefs are coming out, the sheriffs are coming out, saying, terrorists that don't like the Federal Reserve and the New World Order are about to hit.
[02:24:48.422 --> 02:24:49.422]  They want to kill cops.
[02:24:49.923 --> 02:24:53.186]  By the way, there's no evidence they're in the area or that they are going to kill cops.
[02:24:53.826 --> 02:24:58.291]  Just if they talk about freedom and the New World Order, they're evil, they want to kill you.
[02:24:58.651 --> 02:25:00.753]  Citizens, please, tattle on them.
[02:25:01.738 --> 02:25:01.898]  I think?
[02:25:32.618 --> 02:25:48.922]  It's a political desperation tool and they're kicking it into gear right now because Obama is in so much trouble and then Robert Shapiro and all these other Obama advisors put out reports saying we need another Oklahoma City to save Obama.
[02:25:49.362 --> 02:25:59.484]  I mean it is only one millimeter of it being veiled because they think you're so stupid.
[02:26:00.950 --> 02:26:02.292]  Now the globalists are going to have a problem.
[02:26:02.633 --> 02:26:09.144]  The minute the feds blow up a new federal building, the minute you hear that they've blown up a chemical plant or blown up a building,
[02:26:10.410 --> 02:26:14.974]  And they'll be saying it's patriots, that people that like Ron Paul did it, or Alex Jones listeners.
[02:26:15.014 --> 02:26:16.775]  You've got to get there with cameras.
[02:26:17.316 --> 02:26:22.199]  Because with the Oklahoma City, the local news was like, there they are removing the other bombs.
[02:26:22.780 --> 02:26:24.822]  Yes, the ATF was going to go to work that day.
[02:26:25.382 --> 02:26:27.864]  And then, you know, they had to kill some of the witnesses and stuff later.
[02:26:28.224 --> 02:26:30.206]  But because of that, it really caught them with their pants down.
[02:26:30.986 --> 02:26:32.968]  This time, we're going to really catch them.
[02:26:33.308 --> 02:26:36.191]  Just like Kurt Haskell with the underwear bomber saw the U.S.
[02:26:36.231 --> 02:26:37.472]  government get him on the plane.
[02:26:38.072 --> 02:26:40.656]  For a month and a half, the media said, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:26:41.177 --> 02:26:42.419]  Then the pressure got to him.
[02:26:42.439 --> 02:26:46.126]  The Undersecretary of State said, I was ordered by an unnamed U.S.
[02:26:46.166 --> 02:26:49.191]  intelligence agency to get him on the plane without a passport.
[02:26:52.486 --> 02:26:53.607]  Now we're going to catch you.
[02:26:54.107 --> 02:26:55.608]  You better be aware of that.
[02:26:55.668 --> 02:26:57.209]  You can call us terrorists all day.
[02:26:57.489 --> 02:27:00.051]  We know you're the murdering, stinking filth government.
[02:27:00.491 --> 02:27:01.331]  You're not our government.
[02:27:01.552 --> 02:27:03.713]  You're crooks posing as our government.
[02:27:03.993 --> 02:27:05.494]  And we're aware of you and the jig's up.
[02:27:06.094 --> 02:27:07.035]  Let's go to phone calls.
[02:27:07.055 --> 02:27:08.796]  I've got a bunch of other news here.
[02:27:09.556 --> 02:27:11.037]  I kind of got exhausted in New York.
[02:27:11.077 --> 02:27:12.298]  I think I'm doing a good radio show today.
[02:27:12.358 --> 02:27:14.880]  It's just that I am a little bit...
[02:27:18.865 --> 02:27:22.047]  A little bit frazzled, I'll put it to you that way, on the excitement of last week with Bilderberg.
[02:27:22.388 --> 02:27:26.791]  I barely slept Thursday and, no, Wednesday and Thursday I barely slept.
[02:27:27.331 --> 02:27:29.212]  I went to bed at like 2 in the morning, got up at about 5.
[02:27:30.173 --> 02:27:37.038]  And then I barely slept in New York, so... I don't know why I'm saying that on air, it's just... I always say what I'm thinking, that's why.
[02:27:37.058 --> 02:27:40.260]  I'm thinking, man, I feel like I got run over by a freight train.
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:42.262]  Richard in Indiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:27:42.842 --> 02:27:46.745]  Hi Alex, thank you for the great Bilderberg coverage and your team, what a great job.
[02:27:46.765 --> 02:27:47.866]  But on a different subject,
[02:27:48.626 --> 02:27:57.681]  I've been following crude oil prices lately and wondered if you've heard from Lindsey Williams why the retreat over the last three weeks and it's kind of held, gone up a little, down a little.
[02:27:58.542 --> 02:28:01.864]  Anything new about what Lindsey might say from the insiders?
[02:28:02.444 --> 02:28:04.085]  Well, when do you get Lindsey back on?
[02:28:04.145 --> 02:28:09.348]  I mean, I've known for years that it was Ken Fromm, former head of Atlantic Ridgefield, was one of them.
[02:28:09.669 --> 02:28:11.710]  I know who the other source is, I can't give that out.
[02:28:12.450 --> 02:28:19.675]  And I've always said, you know, those sources, that's what they believe is going to go on, and they are high-level people, but it doesn't mean they're always 100% right.
[02:28:20.015 --> 02:28:21.055]  They don't run everything.
[02:28:21.376 --> 02:28:23.497]  You know, Obama's going to get his health care repealed.
[02:28:23.877 --> 02:28:25.217]  Do you think they want that to happen?
[02:28:25.297 --> 02:28:26.378]  No, but we're going to repeal it.
[02:28:26.398 --> 02:28:38.700]  You know, they're not all powerful, but Lindsey, you know, did say when oil was $60-something a barrel, he did say that it would go up to $150 or $200 in the next six months to a year.
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:40.080]  He said that in October.
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:52.323]  So we're now eight, nine months into this, and it did go up $40-something, so he's partially right, but his elite friends won't be right if within about three months
[02:28:53.423 --> 02:28:55.145]  It hasn't gone to 150 or more.
[02:28:55.665 --> 02:28:56.906]  But I know who the sources are.
[02:28:56.966 --> 02:28:57.907]  I know they're telling him this.
[02:28:58.287 --> 02:29:01.930]  I've always said, though, that occasionally they can throw in a lie to Lindsey.
[02:29:02.491 --> 02:29:04.072]  You know, so this is not 100%.
[02:29:04.933 --> 02:29:06.274]  I mean, Lindsey's a truthful guy.
[02:29:06.314 --> 02:29:07.115]  He has real sources.
[02:29:07.155 --> 02:29:08.056]  He's credible.
[02:29:08.756 --> 02:29:10.298]  It's not that Lindsey's being deceptive.
[02:29:10.418 --> 02:29:11.839]  I don't trust these people completely.
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:17.343]  I don't even 100% trust Tucker's sources because someday they could give him disinfo.
[02:29:18.364 --> 02:29:22.567]  Uh, even though Jim Tucker's sources have been proven 100% accurate.
[02:29:22.907 --> 02:29:27.369]  Which then proves that Bilderberg is, to a great extent, calling the shots.
[02:29:27.930 --> 02:29:32.552]  Because Tucker said some stuff sounded crazy over the years, and it happens right on time.
[02:29:33.693 --> 02:29:42.238]  In fact, Tucker, uh, was reading back over the news, it turns out he talked about it going from 60 to 150 back in 2008, and it did.
[02:29:42.578 --> 02:29:43.579]  Which people thought was crazy.
[02:29:44.673 --> 02:29:47.657]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:48.598 --> 02:29:51.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:55.638 --> 02:29:59.259]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:29:59.660 --> 02:30:02.681]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:02.901 --> 02:30:07.683]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:07.703 --> 02:30:13.925]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:14.085 --> 02:30:16.326]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:16.866 --> 02:30:17.146]  Tim Geithner?
[02:30:17.166 --> 02:30:17.407]  Bernanke?
[02:30:17.427 --> 02:30:18.027]  They're arsonists!
[02:30:18.047 --> 02:30:18.788]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:18.808 --> 02:30:20.490]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:35.768 --> 02:30:42.650]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the republic.
[02:30:43.050 --> 02:30:52.153]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:30:54.161 --> 02:30:58.384]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:58.704 --> 02:30:59.324]  Number one.
[02:30:59.624 --> 02:31:02.766]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:03.047 --> 02:31:03.607]  Number two.
[02:31:03.907 --> 02:31:08.450]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:09.231]  It's true.
[02:31:09.531 --> 02:31:14.094]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:14.414 --> 02:31:14.954]  Number three.
[02:31:15.234 --> 02:31:18.516]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:18.817 --> 02:31:22.519]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:22.719 --> 02:31:23.260]  Number 4.
[02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:25.883]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:26.283 --> 02:31:29.667]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:29.967 --> 02:31:30.167]  Number 5.
[02:31:30.748 --> 02:31:34.672]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:34.893 --> 02:31:39.658]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:39.938 --> 02:31:43.962]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:44.122 --> 02:31:45.684]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:45.904 --> 02:31:47.986]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:31:54.113 --> 02:31:59.097]  You've heard Alex Jones talk about eFoods Direct and their highly nutritious, long-term, storable food.
[02:31:59.518 --> 02:32:00.779]  Believe me, it tastes great.

[02:32:09.627 --> 02:32:12.469]  That's a $75 savings and a one-month supply.
[02:32:12.809 --> 02:32:13.750]  Are you kidding me?
[02:32:13.930 --> 02:32:19.996]  For the cost of one greasy, fast-food, supersized combo lunch, you can eat three hearty, delicious meals.
[02:32:20.436 --> 02:32:23.418]  And this offer is good for any of their quick fix supplies.

[02:32:40.149 --> 02:32:40.690]  We're good to go.
[02:33:08.442 --> 02:33:10.103]  There's so much crazy news.
[02:33:10.163 --> 02:33:13.706]  A few weeks ago they found 17 buried pyramids in Egypt.
[02:33:15.047 --> 02:33:23.273]  During the break, Jerram was showing me the Goodyear blimp caught on fire and crashed and reportedly, I'm trying to print the article right now, the pilot died.
[02:33:23.713 --> 02:33:29.998]  Yeah, pilot killed after helping three passengers to make incredible escapes as Goodyear blimp plunges to the ground in flames.
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:32.020]  Over Germany?
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:33.801]  I mean, it's just wild.
[02:33:33.861 --> 02:33:36.082]  What a crazy world we live in.
[02:33:36.102 --> 02:33:37.183]  It looks like the Hindenburg.
[02:33:37.783 --> 02:33:42.065]  But I guess they, you know, use helium since the Hindenburg blew up with hydrogen.
[02:33:43.245 --> 02:33:49.148]  But, uh, what a valiant pilot getting him out of there and then burning up himself.
[02:33:50.762 --> 02:33:51.402]  What a hero.
[02:33:51.502 --> 02:33:52.683]  You know, there's the casket.
[02:33:53.564 --> 02:33:53.884]  Wow.
[02:33:54.404 --> 02:33:56.846]  If you're a radio listener going, what's he talking about?
[02:33:57.126 --> 02:33:58.267]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[02:33:58.287 --> 02:34:02.269]  We're streaming live video at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:02.329 --> 02:34:04.690]  All right, let's try to go to some of your calls now.
[02:34:05.351 --> 02:34:07.352]  Let's talk to Mabel in Virginia.
[02:34:07.392 --> 02:34:08.473]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:34:09.693 --> 02:34:09.954]  Hello.
[02:34:10.494 --> 02:34:10.674]  Hi.
[02:34:11.434 --> 02:34:17.378]  I'm a first-time caller, and I've been supporting you for a couple years now, 65 years old.
[02:34:19.722 --> 02:34:34.909]  And what I see, a lot of problem is with the mainstream media, is why a lot of people don't want to listen and think I'm a conspiracy theorist, is I feel like there's a problem with the mainstream media.
[02:34:34.969 --> 02:34:38.570]  They don't pick up anything about the Bilderbergs or anything like that.
[02:34:38.970 --> 02:34:42.452]  Although I did see Ron Paul twice on CNN.
[02:34:44.358 --> 02:34:46.099]  And I don't believe them anymore.
[02:34:46.119 --> 02:34:50.060]  And I just wonder what you thought about what you could do about the mainstream media.
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:51.981]  Well, here's what's happening.
[02:34:53.301 --> 02:34:56.002]  And that's a great question.
[02:34:56.742 --> 02:34:57.703]  Mabel, it's good to hear from you.
[02:34:57.723 --> 02:34:58.443]  I appreciate the call.
[02:35:00.049 --> 02:35:17.202]  That's what my speech was about at Talkers to the big radio execs and hosting people in New York, was they wanted to know why I was so successful, but they wanted to, some of them, about a magic widget I had or some technical thing I had that made us so successful.
[02:35:17.242 --> 02:35:20.685]  And I got up there and I said, listen, I'm not even the best talker in the world.
[02:35:20.965 --> 02:35:23.347]  A lot of you are a lot more well-spoken than I am.
[02:35:23.367 --> 02:35:25.048]  You have bigger vocabularies.
[02:35:25.088 --> 02:35:26.429]  You're just as smart or smarter.
[02:35:27.409 --> 02:35:42.752]  I said I've been successful because I have passion and I've been proven accurate and people trust me and we've also had to innovate to get our message out so we've tried everything and so we've had a lot of success in different venues because we've tried everything.
[02:35:44.011 --> 02:35:53.543]  I mean, I tried Justin.tv three years ago at the DNC and, you know, we got a few hundred thousand views, but the technology was so cruddy that I dropped it.
[02:35:53.603 --> 02:35:57.547]  We tried it again this week, got over three million views, and
[02:35:59.850 --> 02:36:04.933]  We're looking at some other platforms as well, so we can stream live, free video to people when we're on the ground.
[02:36:04.953 --> 02:36:06.674]  I mean, that really is the future of reporting.
[02:36:07.094 --> 02:36:09.316]  All citizen journalists will be able to use this.
[02:36:09.396 --> 02:36:18.661]  And on top of all of our other tens of millions of listeners and viewers, I mean, three million plus, three and a half million and growing.
[02:36:19.662 --> 02:36:21.423]  I checked it last night, it was three and a half million.
[02:36:21.463 --> 02:36:22.423]  I don't know what it is now.
[02:36:23.284 --> 02:36:24.805]  Just on the Justin TV channel,
[02:36:25.911 --> 02:36:32.455]  My guys with cell phones in Switzerland shooting little two-minute videos and three million people watched it.
[02:36:33.475 --> 02:36:37.818]  I mean Glenn Beck at his height had three million viewers a night.
[02:36:38.558 --> 02:36:40.739]  People kill for three million viewers.
[02:36:41.319 --> 02:36:48.864]  People go to any length for that and here we are on every media format growing.
[02:36:50.304 --> 02:36:51.045]  Now the system
[02:36:53.134 --> 02:36:56.457]  To answer your question, ma'am, see, here's why I can't be simple.
[02:36:56.617 --> 02:36:57.758]  Everything is really complex.
[02:36:57.798 --> 02:36:58.719]  The world is complex.
[02:36:59.059 --> 02:37:16.153]  And we've gotten in these bad positions and media, dominant corporate media, that is not so dominant these days, is able to lie to you because most of their own operatives are just dumbed down as well and just repeating what corporations and government press releases tell them out of pure laziness.
[02:37:16.573 --> 02:37:18.134]  They don't have a passion for the news.
[02:37:18.514 --> 02:37:20.276]  They don't have passion for analysis.
[02:37:21.337 --> 02:37:22.418]  They're not obsessed with it.
[02:37:23.478 --> 02:37:31.046]  And so most media that's, you know, quote, establishment, is not even so much lying to you purposefully.
[02:37:32.287 --> 02:37:33.748]  They don't know which end is up.
[02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:43.458]  Now what's happening is cable networks plunging, broadcast TV disintegrating, newspapers decimated.
[02:37:43.558 --> 02:37:44.499]  I mean, you know the drill.
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:46.341]  None of this is a secret.
[02:37:47.321 --> 02:37:48.322]  Alternative media.
[02:37:49.043 --> 02:37:51.705]  We have Saturn rockets tied to our backs.
[02:37:51.765 --> 02:37:54.547]  I mean, we are blasting through the stratosphere.
[02:37:56.049 --> 02:37:58.951]  People... In fact, we've even done a test.
[02:38:00.632 --> 02:38:02.974]  I've done videos in my new fancy studio.
[02:38:03.014 --> 02:38:04.216]  People don't even like it as much.
[02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:13.784]  Folks just automatically do not like anything that's slick now.
[02:38:15.609 --> 02:38:19.711]  They just out of hand do not like the mainstream media.
[02:38:23.332 --> 02:38:30.655]  And again, we need to stop using that term mainstream media because more and more it is not the mainstream.
[02:38:30.755 --> 02:38:32.876]  It is the propaganda media.
[02:38:32.996 --> 02:38:38.778]  It is the establishment press release repeater network.
[02:38:39.158 --> 02:38:43.460]  Now, it's no secret that they're falling apart.
[02:38:45.882 --> 02:38:49.045]  But, what have I told you for more than 10 years, since 2000?
[02:38:50.366 --> 02:38:53.708]  For 11 years, what have I told you each and every week, on the week?
[02:38:54.089 --> 02:38:58.652]  How many hundreds of articles have I written, and Aaron Dykes, and Paul Watson, and Steve Watson?
[02:38:59.473 --> 02:39:01.475]  Hard to believe Paul's been with us almost 10 years now.
[02:39:01.495 --> 02:39:02.936]  It'll be 10 years next month.
[02:39:04.117 --> 02:39:08.841]  How many hundreds of articles have we written saying, here's how they're going to kill the internet?
[02:39:09.946 --> 02:39:11.669]  Here's exactly how they're going to do it.
[02:39:12.010 --> 02:39:17.941]  Here's how they're going to phase out the internet you knew and put you onto an internet that is not free.
[02:39:18.993 --> 02:39:44.848]  And we explain the taxes, the regulations, the tracking, the internet IDs, the new private network internets, the cloud systems, the Internet2 network, where, oh yeah, you can still be on the old internet that the Pentagon's going to cyber attack and basically shut down, but if you want to be on our new internet, you're going to be tracked, you're going to be traced, you're going to be taxed, and we're going to decide, via terms of service, what you can and can't say.
[02:39:48.294 --> 02:39:52.738]  And so I told you, a decade ago, they didn't call it cloud computing then.
[02:39:54.039 --> 02:40:00.464]  Internet2 put out public minutes of their meetings in Tokyo and Austin, Texas and Chicago.
[02:40:00.705 --> 02:40:01.465]  One meeting a year.
[02:40:02.626 --> 02:40:03.727]  Fortune 500.
[02:40:05.048 --> 02:40:06.670]  Top universities and government.
[02:40:08.551 --> 02:40:12.675]  And they get at the meetings, they stand up there and they tell you exactly how they're going to kill the web.
[02:40:14.011 --> 02:40:15.172]  And it's complex.
[02:40:15.612 --> 02:40:17.774]  It's a lot of different things like Lego pieces.
[02:40:18.134 --> 02:40:19.235]  You see them all over the table.
[02:40:19.255 --> 02:40:20.576]  You're like, how does that kill the internet?
[02:40:21.256 --> 02:40:25.399]  Internet IDs, internet taxes, two platforms, cloud computing.
[02:40:25.720 --> 02:40:32.324]  You notice Microsoft, Apple, and Google have all announced in the last month the cloud computing.
[02:40:32.965 --> 02:40:34.006]  And you're like, well, that's great.
[02:40:34.066 --> 02:40:35.327]  I don't have to have a big device on me.
[02:40:35.747 --> 02:40:36.648]  Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[02:40:37.468 --> 02:40:39.109]  Yes, everything's a double-edged sword.
[02:40:39.450 --> 02:40:41.171]  Technology is neutral, generally.
[02:40:43.058 --> 02:40:52.004]  But you're going to now have your information on their system and soon the devices are not going to be able to store.
[02:40:52.987 --> 02:40:54.027]  Your data on them.
[02:40:54.087 --> 02:41:12.250]  The software is not going to interface with the cloud systems, and they described it back in 2000, 2001, as everything will be on private networks, private servers, the devices you have will only interface, and then you'll be under their rules and their control, and you're like, well, I just won't go on their websites.
[02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:21.292]  They have set up, with government and corporate money, the new internet, the new servers, the new systems, where that is the internet.
[02:41:22.054 --> 02:41:29.539]  And they're shunting off the majority of the regular, real, organic internet more and more into their systems.
[02:41:30.179 --> 02:41:40.046]  And the big technology companies, the technologists, are getting together and openly charting and bragging about this system and how it's a monopoly for them.
[02:41:41.175 --> 02:41:41.815]  It's very simple.
[02:41:42.276 --> 02:41:54.203]  It's kind of like foreign companies coming into the U.S., financing your state legislature, and a year later, they sign over half the highways in your state to the foreign company to put tolls on existing roads.
[02:41:55.865 --> 02:41:58.806]  And you say it's illegal to put tolls on existing roads.
[02:41:58.846 --> 02:42:02.008]  Well, Bush signed a waiver, an executive order saying it was okay.
[02:42:02.389 --> 02:42:04.150]  Well, that itself is unconstitutional.
[02:42:04.390 --> 02:42:05.991]  Well, we've got to enforce the Constitution.
[02:42:06.271 --> 02:42:07.132]  It's there to protect us.
[02:42:10.233 --> 02:42:12.495]  People say, well, the Constitution failed, but he's something new.
[02:42:12.715 --> 02:42:13.816]  No, we failed it.
[02:42:14.657 --> 02:42:16.019]  And it's the same thing with this Internet, too.
[02:42:16.179 --> 02:42:19.562]  So, that's why the head of Microsoft was there.
[02:42:19.602 --> 02:42:21.484]  That's why the head of Google was at Bilderberg.
[02:42:21.964 --> 02:42:25.408]  That's why they're meeting with Mandelson, who's openly called for Internet censorship.
[02:42:27.176 --> 02:42:33.521]  There's a headline from ZDNet, Dragons in the Cloud, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.
[02:42:34.021 --> 02:42:38.805]  And what did Google and Microsoft and others help the Chinese government the last decade?
[02:42:39.906 --> 02:42:51.695]  You know Google and Microsoft and others helped set up the protocols for tracking, for blacklist, for internet IDs, for firewalls against alternative media in China.
[02:42:52.015 --> 02:42:52.976]  They know how to do it.
[02:42:52.996 --> 02:42:55.038]  You know, when I hear these idiotic statements of,
[02:42:56.218 --> 02:42:59.521]  Well, you know, they won't be able to censor the Internet.
[02:43:01.403 --> 02:43:02.784]  I haven't even gotten into one-tenth of it.
[02:43:02.804 --> 02:43:03.384]  That's the problem.
[02:43:03.404 --> 02:43:04.365]  And I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:43:04.405 --> 02:43:06.627]  But the lady raises an important point.
[02:43:07.248 --> 02:43:08.409]  Their old media is dying.
[02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:09.610]  They're desperate.
[02:43:09.730 --> 02:43:11.391]  They're a bunch of crooks who know they've been caught.
[02:43:11.832 --> 02:43:14.014]  Are they going to let the Internet continue to operate as it was?
[02:43:14.074 --> 02:43:14.174]  No.
[02:43:14.957 --> 02:43:18.941]  They're not going to stop with clouds and new devices that only work on clouds.
[02:43:19.341 --> 02:43:21.723]  They're not going to stop with Internet IDs and Internet taxes.
[02:43:22.044 --> 02:43:23.405]  You see all those things getting passed.
[02:43:23.905 --> 02:43:30.892]  The Cybersecurity Act openly says under federal law, all IT professionals will have to get a federal certification.
[02:43:31.833 --> 02:43:34.716]  All IT that serves 100 or more customers.
[02:43:35.336 --> 02:43:36.597]  That means readers, even.
[02:43:37.458 --> 02:43:47.280]  We'll have to have federally approved devices in their internal network to protect you from hacking, in quotes, and alert government to the hacking.
[02:43:50.001 --> 02:43:52.241]  Now, you notice they're trying to pass cybersecurity again.
[02:43:52.481 --> 02:43:53.642]  They've already put this in place.
[02:43:53.662 --> 02:43:56.402]  They just want to make it the law now so they can come out in the open with it.
[02:43:57.062 --> 02:43:57.863]  And what are they saying?
[02:43:58.583 --> 02:44:00.043]  Oh my gosh, we're being hacked.
[02:44:00.463 --> 02:44:02.064]  Oh, the IMF World Bank's being hacked.
[02:44:02.184 --> 02:44:03.824]  Oh, we've got to pass the cybersecurity.
[02:44:05.532 --> 02:44:06.832]  And this is not my opinion.
[02:44:06.912 --> 02:44:09.533]  This is what they always said they would do.
[02:44:09.813 --> 02:44:18.375]  So they build the web, your tax money going into government systems, but predominantly your purchase of bandwidth, computers, telecommunication services.
[02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:22.116]  It's the only growth area in our economy in the last decade or so.
[02:44:22.676 --> 02:44:28.397]  The only thing keeping America afloat is technology and integration of these systems and the development.
[02:44:28.697 --> 02:44:33.238]  And now they're just gobbling it up as monopoly men in the name of security.
[02:44:34.881 --> 02:44:36.162]  It's the same on every front.
[02:44:36.422 --> 02:44:38.923]  The threat of cyber terror, the threat of physical terror.
[02:44:39.343 --> 02:44:42.864]  It's the skeleton key that opens every door for these people.
[02:44:44.065 --> 02:44:45.185]  And so the fight is on.
[02:44:45.585 --> 02:44:47.006]  Will people organize against it?
[02:44:47.046 --> 02:44:48.506]  Will folks recognize where it is?
[02:44:48.666 --> 02:44:49.147]  I don't know!
[02:44:51.047 --> 02:44:53.488]  But we're already blocked on Google News.
[02:44:53.588 --> 02:44:54.549]  We weren't a year ago.
[02:44:56.058 --> 02:45:01.902]  They already are trying to block our Google bombs, undoubtedly with a key index of keywords that have been blocked.
[02:45:01.942 --> 02:45:04.363]  If I give some obscure word, it becomes number one.
[02:45:04.684 --> 02:45:08.006]  I can't give big terms like Bilderberg now and have it be number one.
[02:45:08.026 --> 02:45:08.606]  They blocked it.
[02:45:09.166 --> 02:45:10.387]  There's no doubt we went to number one.
[02:45:10.407 --> 02:45:10.907]  They blocked it.
[02:45:11.127 --> 02:45:13.989]  It wasn't even in the top hundred last week.
[02:45:14.530 --> 02:45:15.070]  They blocked it.
[02:45:16.658 --> 02:45:30.082]  So they know what they're doing, and already they admittedly changed their algorithm three times this year so far, and Google openly said it's to block alternative media websites, like InfoWars.com and Drudge Report.
[02:45:31.563 --> 02:45:33.443]  We're not alternative media, we are the media.
[02:45:34.164 --> 02:45:36.064]  I mean, I could have 10 billion listeners.
[02:45:36.264 --> 02:45:38.265]  I know there's not 10 billion people, it's hypothetical.
[02:45:38.845 --> 02:45:44.707]  I could have 7 billion listeners, every person on earth, and Google would say I was alternative media and block me.
[02:45:45.526 --> 02:45:48.309]  What they mean is, they don't want you having the choice.
[02:45:48.409 --> 02:45:52.334]  They don't want my ideas on the intellectual store shelf.
[02:45:52.795 --> 02:45:54.477]  They don't want you having access to it.
[02:45:54.717 --> 02:45:57.420]  They're already testing censorship models.
[02:45:57.700 --> 02:45:59.723]  They're already trying to block us.
[02:45:59.963 --> 02:46:01.926]  They're already trying to squeeze us.
[02:46:03.342 --> 02:46:05.324]  The Feds are announcing in the kill switch.
[02:46:05.564 --> 02:46:06.845]  I told you it wouldn't just be a kill switch.
[02:46:07.266 --> 02:46:10.088]  Government messages over radio, TV, your cell phone.
[02:46:10.529 --> 02:46:11.950]  It got announced last month.
[02:46:12.471 --> 02:46:14.593]  I told you they'd have telescreens in public places.
[02:46:14.993 --> 02:46:16.334]  It got announced four months ago.
[02:46:16.815 --> 02:46:18.196]  Folks, this is happening.
[02:46:18.516 --> 02:46:22.920]  I told you the FBI was going to start breaking in your house without warrants and going through your trash.
[02:46:23.681 --> 02:46:30.026]  It's been announced, Associated Press, New York Times, no warrants, going through your garbage, breaking into your house.
[02:46:30.807 --> 02:46:31.928]  They're doing it!
[02:46:32.568 --> 02:46:33.048]  Okay?
[02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:38.112]  They tell us what they're going to do years before in their internal memorandums and reports.
[02:46:39.073 --> 02:46:39.814]  Oh, heaven help us.
[02:46:42.981 --> 02:46:45.923]  They're not adding all this because the terror threat is increasing.
[02:46:46.363 --> 02:46:50.786]  They're always adding more of this stuff because it's part of an architecture.
[02:46:51.366 --> 02:46:52.847]  It's part of a rollout plan.
[02:46:53.168 --> 02:46:54.228]  It's part of a blueprint.
[02:46:55.569 --> 02:46:56.570]  Jordan and Texas.
[02:46:56.750 --> 02:46:57.190]  Here's another one.
[02:46:57.210 --> 02:47:02.874]  Has Google Panda update hurt demand media stock?
[02:47:04.135 --> 02:47:05.255]  And yeah, there it goes.
[02:47:05.295 --> 02:47:06.356]  There's the news reporting.
[02:47:08.818 --> 02:47:10.359]  Print that for me, how these systems are
[02:47:11.394 --> 02:47:13.678]  Really shutting down the free flow of information on the web.
[02:47:13.698 --> 02:47:16.683]  I mean, it's what it's designed to do, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:16.703 --> 02:47:22.192]  They're putting the bigger gates in the gatekeeper slots of the web.
[02:47:22.592 --> 02:47:23.914]  Jordan and Texas, you're on the air.
[02:47:25.413 --> 02:47:26.834]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call again.
[02:47:27.115 --> 02:47:27.355]  Welcome.
[02:47:27.515 --> 02:47:29.557]  I think we'll keep you, Alex.
[02:47:30.097 --> 02:47:30.758]  Two questions.
[02:47:31.338 --> 02:47:35.782]  Do you happen to know of the 9-11 documentary that was supposed to come out on June 6th because I can't remember it?
[02:47:36.463 --> 02:47:39.486]  It had Dave Mustaine and I think Rosie O'Donnell if I remember right.
[02:47:40.206 --> 02:47:46.051]  And two, what was it the iPhone 4 you were talking about with a guest I think about six weeks ago did?
[02:47:47.423 --> 02:47:54.167]  You could scan other people's phones and get their data and their address and stuff like that.
[02:47:54.267 --> 02:47:57.969]  I want to find that episode on Prison Planet TV so I can download it because I have a subscription.
[02:47:58.509 --> 02:48:02.031]  None of my friends seem to believe me about this stuff, so if you could help me on those two questions, that'd be great.
[02:48:06.701 --> 02:48:13.104]  Threat fusion centers admittedly have antenna systems that can grab all the cell phone data and go through it.
[02:48:13.544 --> 02:48:30.033]  They also in Michigan and other areas, I don't remember, it was like a month ago I covered that, I can't remember the exact date, it was in the Detroit Free Press, it was everywhere, where they pull you over for speeding and then grab your phone and plug it in and it has a code breaker and within seconds breaks the code and downloads everything in your phone.
[02:48:31.053 --> 02:48:35.336]  And then about two weeks ago, federal court in San Francisco ruled they can do that.
[02:48:36.277 --> 02:48:37.638]  So that's all over the news.
[02:48:37.698 --> 02:48:44.702]  If you just search police taking cell phone data without warrants, it's all over the news.
[02:48:45.923 --> 02:48:47.644]  Okay, and what about the documentary, the 9-11 documentary?
[02:48:47.664 --> 02:48:50.086]  Do you happen to remember what I'm talking about on that one?
[02:48:50.166 --> 02:48:53.008]  No, I didn't know Dave Mustaine is in a 9-11 truth documentary.
[02:48:53.834 --> 02:48:59.339]  Yeah, I saw the trailer for it about probably a good month or so ago, maybe six weeks, and it said it's coming out on June 6th.
[02:48:59.859 --> 02:49:00.560]  I can't remember the name.
[02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:02.621]  Maybe you can have your crew help me out or something.
[02:49:02.661 --> 02:49:05.744]  I'll, you know, but it had... Are you the maker of it?
[02:49:05.764 --> 02:49:06.184]  No, no, no.
[02:49:06.244 --> 02:49:07.626]  I appreciate your call.
[02:49:07.866 --> 02:49:08.907]  No, I mean, I just don't know.
[02:49:08.967 --> 02:49:11.149]  It's just... I mean, I would do this.
[02:49:11.189 --> 02:49:12.390]  I would say Dave Mustaine.
[02:49:13.210 --> 02:49:13.691]  Dave...
[02:49:15.418 --> 02:49:16.258]  Dave Mustaine.
[02:49:16.278 --> 02:49:17.319]  I mean, I can call him up.
[02:49:17.899 --> 02:49:18.660]  Dave Mustaine.
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:19.560]  I want to get him back on.
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:23.823]  I called him up a month ago, and he said, hey, come out here and see me at the Big Four thing.
[02:49:23.843 --> 02:49:25.924]  And I said, well, I'll try.
[02:49:25.944 --> 02:49:27.345]  And he goes, call me back, Alex.
[02:49:27.405 --> 02:49:28.846]  And I was like, I want to get you on the show.
[02:49:28.866 --> 02:49:30.126]  And he goes, no, come hang out with us.
[02:49:30.526 --> 02:49:31.847]  So I'm like, I don't have time for that.
[02:49:31.867 --> 02:49:32.748]  But I love Dave Mustaine.
[02:49:32.768 --> 02:49:33.328]  He's a great guy.
[02:49:33.348 --> 02:49:34.168]  Let me see.
[02:49:34.188 --> 02:49:34.949]  Dave Mustaine, 9-1-9.
[02:49:34.989 --> 02:49:35.809]  Where is it?
[02:49:35.829 --> 02:49:37.931]  9-11 film.
[02:49:42.345 --> 02:49:44.626]  Let's see, I didn't really know he got into that.
[02:49:44.706 --> 02:49:45.347]  I know he's a listener.
[02:49:45.387 --> 02:49:46.287]  I know his wife's a listener.
[02:49:46.327 --> 02:49:47.108]  I want to say hi to him.
[02:49:47.728 --> 02:49:49.910]  Dave Mustaine of Megadeth questions 9-11.
[02:49:51.010 --> 02:49:54.712]  That's 2009, and that was when Dave Mustaine was on my show.
[02:49:54.732 --> 02:50:00.596]  I don't even remember him doing that, so... That's 9-11 blogger comes up there.
[02:50:00.616 --> 02:50:05.038]  I know Rosie O'Donnell questioned it, like four years ago.
[02:50:05.539 --> 02:50:07.760]  Okay, we got to go to break.
[02:50:07.780 --> 02:50:09.401]  We'll come back, take a few more calls on the other side.
[02:50:11.752 --> 02:50:17.275]  You know, the one thing I don't ever want to happen here is for us to just get comfortable with all this tyranny.
[02:50:17.735 --> 02:50:18.676]  I mean, just look at this news.
[02:50:19.036 --> 02:50:21.798]  FBI expands agents' investigative power.
[02:50:22.078 --> 02:50:22.558]  Who did that?
[02:50:22.598 --> 02:50:23.279]  The FBI.
[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:25.260]  Here's another one.
[02:50:25.300 --> 02:50:29.602]  FBI agents get leeway to push privacy bounds.
[02:50:31.223 --> 02:50:34.705]  Speaking of Dave Mustaine, there's Dave Mustaine on guitar with Metallica.
[02:50:35.746 --> 02:50:36.726]  She can!
[02:50:37.167 --> 02:50:38.467]  She can destroy!
[02:50:38.487 --> 02:50:38.728]  Ha ha!
[02:50:38.808 --> 02:50:39.648]  Ha ha!
[02:50:39.748 --> 02:50:40.529]  Ha ha!
[02:50:43.114 --> 02:50:44.557]  Ah, an incredible guitarist.
[02:50:44.597 --> 02:50:45.079]  Listen to that.
[02:50:46.723 --> 02:50:49.068]  We'll be right back.
[02:50:49.088 --> 02:50:49.510]  Stay with us.
[02:50:54.890 --> 02:50:56.891]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[02:50:57.472 --> 02:50:57.992]  No kidding!
[02:50:58.152 --> 02:51:02.194]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[02:51:02.534 --> 02:51:04.996]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[02:51:05.296 --> 02:51:08.518]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[02:51:08.758 --> 02:51:13.581]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[02:51:13.781 --> 02:51:20.505]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic, safe for direct food contact, and contain no BPA.
[02:51:20.705 --> 02:51:24.587]  Tadler Lids are dishwasher safe, usable with standard pressure or water bath canning,
[02:51:24.727 --> 02:51:26.708]  Eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion.

[02:51:37.474 --> 02:51:38.414]  The original since 1976.
[02:51:54.304 --> 02:51:56.626]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:51:56.686 --> 02:51:58.888]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:51:59.008 --> 02:52:01.730]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:02.210 --> 02:52:06.954]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:07.314 --> 02:52:11.518]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:11.818 --> 02:52:14.139]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:14.159 --> 02:52:16.700]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:17.060 --> 02:52:19.621]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:19.962 --> 02:52:27.565]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:27.904 --> 02:52:33.187]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:33.287 --> 02:52:36.089]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:36.149 --> 02:52:39.591]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:39.831 --> 02:52:40.752]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:40.912 --> 02:52:42.213]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:42.233 --> 02:52:43.233]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:57.361 --> 02:53:58.861]  All right, final segment.
[02:54:00.442 --> 02:54:02.602]  Some of the other police state news I didn't get into.
[02:54:09.324 --> 02:54:10.365]  You've got this report.
[02:54:10.505 --> 02:54:14.126]  City government demands all keys to properties.
[02:54:16.086 --> 02:54:19.687]  They want to be able to get into your house, quote, during emergencies.
[02:54:19.727 --> 02:54:21.628]  It's always for your safety.
[02:54:21.668 --> 02:54:25.689]  And the FBI wants to go through your trash for your safety as well.
[02:54:27.042 --> 02:54:28.943]  That's just some of the news I have on that front.
[02:54:29.583 --> 02:54:33.606]  And, of course, I've been telling you that when they try to pass the European Cybersecurity Act and the U.S.
[02:54:33.646 --> 02:54:35.907]  Cybersecurity Act, there'll be all these attacks.
[02:54:36.287 --> 02:54:39.689]  Here it is, IMF hit by very major cybersecurity attack.
[02:54:40.550 --> 02:54:41.110]  Oh, yes.
[02:54:41.390 --> 02:54:44.412]  And the Bandera sheriff here in Texas isn't worried about
[02:54:44.992 --> 02:54:46.293]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:55:10.914 --> 02:55:12.377]  I appreciate you taking my call here.
[02:55:13.078 --> 02:55:24.518]  I just wanted to let you know I graduated from a prestigious college last summer, film school, and one of my private loan lenders, Sally May, maybe you've heard of them,
[02:55:26.068 --> 02:55:33.314]  Uh, they ended up pulling the rug out from underneath me about a semester before I graduated, so I literally was almost not able to graduate.
[02:55:33.354 --> 02:55:34.775]  I didn't have the finances to do it.
[02:55:35.456 --> 02:55:39.139]  So I ended up going to the college and just begging them for some assistance.
[02:55:39.639 --> 02:55:50.928]  They ended up giving me a private loan through the school, and one of the conditions, and I didn't understand this until well after the fact, one of the conditions of them giving me this private loan to finish my schooling
[02:55:51.608 --> 02:55:53.669]  Have you heard about the SWAT team visits people are getting now?
[02:56:16.303 --> 02:56:17.064]  No, no, what's that?
[02:56:35.188 --> 02:56:35.728]  Well, right.
[02:56:35.828 --> 02:56:38.169]  I've been getting phone calls from their goon squad.
[02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:42.050]  They call my house, they call my parents' house, threatening this, that, and the other thing.
[02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:47.892]  I mean, I've been considering trying to do Chapter 11 bankruptcy just to get these guys off my case.
[02:56:48.332 --> 02:56:51.753]  But then, of course, my mom being a cosigner, they just go after her and take her house.
[02:56:51.773 --> 02:56:52.833]  So I'm doomed either way.
[02:56:53.633 --> 02:57:01.620]  And remember, the banks made all this up out of nothing, and by throwing all this money at education, it massively inflated the cost of education.
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:03.141]  I hear you.
[02:57:03.442 --> 02:57:06.084]  It's just terrible, my friend, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:57:06.424 --> 02:57:07.325]  I'm really concerned.
[02:57:08.286 --> 02:57:10.448]  I thought globalism was going to be great for our country.
[02:57:10.508 --> 02:57:11.529]  Oops, sorry, it killed it.
[02:57:12.549 --> 02:57:14.431]  But the globalist answer is more globalism.
[02:57:14.451 --> 02:57:15.012]  But don't worry.
[02:57:15.987 --> 02:57:24.510]  Don't worry, they've got, what was it, three million dollars plus for chimpanzees to watch pornography.
[02:57:25.550 --> 02:57:27.211]  I'm not kidding, that was in the news last week.
[02:57:27.491 --> 02:57:29.512]  Millions for shrimp on treadmills.
[02:57:31.012 --> 02:57:38.095]  And don't worry, here in Austin, taxpayers have to pay for, city and county paid for abortions.
[02:57:38.775 --> 02:57:41.136]  But if you don't give them all that money, a SWAT team's coming.
[02:57:41.816 --> 02:57:42.537]  Here's BBC.
[02:57:43.857 --> 02:57:52.286]  Countries pledge $4.3 billion in funding for child vaccines because they care so much about the children.
[02:57:52.806 --> 02:57:58.011]  And of course that'll be a big boondoggle of money paid to the big pharma companies of your tax money.
[02:57:58.672 --> 02:58:04.037]  Countries have pledged an unprecedented $4.3 billion to help vaccinate children against preventable diseases.
[02:58:04.858 --> 02:58:05.178]  Yeah!
[02:58:05.839 --> 02:58:08.641]  You're never going to get pneumonia, honey, but you're also never going to have kids.
[02:58:09.402 --> 02:58:11.743]  They've been caught in every major vaccine in these U.N.
[02:58:11.784 --> 02:58:13.185]  initiatives sterilizing people.
[02:58:13.725 --> 02:58:16.587]  Oh, we got a polio vaccine for you.
[02:58:16.627 --> 02:58:18.388]  By the way, it's going to give you polio.
[02:58:18.428 --> 02:58:19.389]  You'll never walk again.
[02:58:19.409 --> 02:58:22.732]  We're the Bilderberg Group.
[02:58:22.772 --> 02:58:23.472]  We love you.
[02:58:23.492 --> 02:58:24.953]  And here's another one.
[02:58:24.993 --> 02:58:27.675]  No privacy on Amazon's cloud drive.
[02:58:28.216 --> 02:58:31.999]  Amazon's announcing you'll have no privacy when you're on the Amazon cloud drive.
[02:58:32.379 --> 02:58:33.180]  See you back tomorrow.
