[00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:21.297]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:25.019]  29 days to the most important election in world history.
[00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:26.460]  A referendum?
[00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:29.657]  A nationalism versus globalism.
[00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:39.261]  By the way, in the first round of voting out of more than 15 candidates, the Donald Trump of Brazil wants a second amendment, free market, you name it.
[00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:43.838]  They tried to kill, they stabbed in the liver and the kidneys.
[00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:50.883]  He just won the first round ultra massively by a huge margin.
[00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:55.306]  Sending the globalist Facebook, YouTube, Twitter into a tailspin.
[00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:59.129]  Soros is crapping his wicked Nazi britches right now.
[00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.652]  This is just continuing the trend worldwide against the globalist.
[00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:07.655]  Big multinational corporations above the law allied with the Chai Koms.
[00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:11.357]  Coming in and trying to take our nations over and jacking up taxes?
[00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.058]  And then looting everything?
[00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.639]  And then they're led by evil, wicked people like Pelosi and Juncker?
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.300]  And the Chinese dictator?
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.421]  I mean, what a sick joke.
[00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:24.542]  What a sick joke.
[00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:28.423]  People are coming off the plantation like Kanye West just said.
[00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:30.484]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.172]  It's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:01:33.972 --> 00:01:37.354]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room.
[00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:57.583]  You know, I saw this last week before they rolled out examples of it, and I should have led the show with it, but it shows how conditioned we are to Big Brother that even I, you know, that Trailblaze pioneered exposing that they would put little appliances in your house that surveil you and control you.
[00:01:59.073 --> 00:02:02.395]  Didn't even cover it, but now with the video of them actually doing it, it's incredible.
[00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:26.813]  It's a activated robot hooked in to Facebook and Zuckerberg saying, our users trust us, they're a bunch of dumb effers, tied into the communist Chinese, tied into all these different groups, tied into hackers, and now, I'd tell people 20 years ago, cover up your webcam, nobody listened to me until James Comey said he did it himself three years ago,
[00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:33.904]  And now they just go, hey, let's come all the way out and just say, of course, we're going to be in your house.
[00:02:34.445 --> 00:02:35.765]  Of course, we're going to be watching you.
[00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:41.146]  And of course, the camera is going to be waiting and following you around the home and listening to you.
[00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:46.607]  And in the terms of service, they admit the information is given to third party groups.
[00:02:46.687 --> 00:02:51.369]  But then when you're at Zuckerberg's offices, what did they notice a few years ago?
[00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:56.810]  That he covers the camera on his computer.
[00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:13.307]  But he thinks you're a dumb effer and that you're going to take this new Google device called Portal, that's what it is, a portal to a big evil corporation run by the globalists, the Democrats, and that you're going to put this in your house.
[00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.309]  It's one thing to have a quote webcam or whatever.
[00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:22.655]  This is an AI computer that follows you and listens to you and is grabbing everything you say and putting it into a digital algorithm.
[00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:24.328]  of course.
[00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:54.378]  Oh, but look, it's got a little thing to cover the camera up when you want to, because you understand it's watching you.
[00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.482]  Remember, Who Pioneered was made fun of in documentaries 20 years ago.
[00:04:01.622 --> 00:04:04.784]  When BBC and people come to my house, they'd say, why is your webcam covered?
[00:04:05.465 --> 00:04:12.449]  And I said, because hackers and governments and others can dial in and use it, but I also go into the computer and disable it, except when I use it.
[00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:16.131]  Then they laughed at me, see, because being right is bad.
[00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:18.278]  When you're ahead of your time.
[00:04:18.298 --> 00:04:20.720]  Because you're not supposed to be there and actually warn people.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.181]  So that's coming up as well.
[00:04:23.302 --> 00:04:27.845]  Also, Google's being summoned to the Pentagon for their treacherous activities with Communist China.
[00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:29.747]  I told you last week that was coming.
[00:04:30.694 --> 00:04:47.020]  We're also going to get into Taylor Swift rolling over like a yellow-bellied possum to the establishment, talking about her Tennessee values, giving your Los Angeles, New York City leftist globalist values, not even the values of folks in New York City, the values of the globalists and the rest of them.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.400]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:50.861]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:52.382]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:56.314 --> 00:04:57.655]  Well, the moment of truth is here.
[00:04:58.015 --> 00:05:05.139]  George Soros now is taking control of PayPal and these bandits are trying to shut down our final payment processors and end InfoWars.
[00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.240]  We've got to reach this point.
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.062]  And listen, I knew fighting the globalists, there'd be a price to pay.
[00:05:10.362 --> 00:05:13.344]  And I did it because I knew what horrible individuals they were.
[00:05:13.884 --> 00:05:19.448]  And I was willing to sacrifice myself, my name, my treasure, on the altar of having a better future like our forebears did.
[00:05:19.988 --> 00:05:21.909]  But I don't want to go down without a real fight.
[00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.791]  Because I'm going to keep swinging until the end.
[00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:37.919]  But if you, the listeners, really awaken and financially support us like never before with the payment systems we have left at InfoWareStore.com, it is going to allow us to really hold the line like the Alamo.
[00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:40.780]  Until we either win or we're defeated.
[00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:53.029]  So in the words of the great founder of Texas, and that wasn't Houston, that was Colonel Travis, victory or death, we are going to win if you take action.
[00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.350]  We're going to win if you support us.
[00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.611]  But it's now all in your hands.
[00:06:02.416 --> 00:06:07.460]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.943 --> 00:06:20.065]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now only 29 days out from the referendum against globalism.
[00:06:20.085 --> 00:06:26.488]  And across the world, other populist, nationalist, patriot candidates are in the lead and winning.
[00:06:27.168 --> 00:06:30.830]  Like what just happened in Brazil, it's all coming up today.
[00:06:31.946 --> 00:06:33.567]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:06:33.687 --> 00:06:35.047]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:38.249]  Let me tell you what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:45.071]  The Democrats have pledged to get extremely violent and aggressive.
[00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:49.093]  Top Dem Trump GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh.
[00:06:49.153 --> 00:06:56.256]  Politico says after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[00:06:57.336 --> 00:06:59.497]  The ruthlessness is what blew up in your face, idiots.
[00:07:00.198 --> 00:07:00.638]  The bullying.
[00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:10.471]  Continuing, we'll get into incredible news where the city of Columbus, Ohio is not going to celebrate Columbus Day because he's evil.
[00:07:12.022 --> 00:07:13.123]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:13.603 --> 00:07:19.906]  And don't worry, the city of Austin is set to change the name of Austin because they say Stephen F. Austin was a racist.
[00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:22.888]  And don't worry, there's more news on that front.
[00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:33.273]  One of the former top astronauts has come out and apologized for saying that Winston Churchill was a good guy and quoting Winston Churchill.
[00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:34.434]  This is incredible.
[00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:38.196]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you go to any time or place in the world
[00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:52.513]  It'd be like saying that you couldn't ever have a statue to somebody who lived in Africa 200 years ago because slavery was legal in Africa 200 years ago.
[00:07:53.394 --> 00:07:55.235]  Hell, it's still legal in many African countries today.
[00:07:55.795 --> 00:08:01.318]  But we don't run around saying how evil black people are because slavery still goes on in three African countries at least.
[00:08:02.372 --> 00:08:04.193]  Or that the Africans were selling slaves.
[00:08:04.673 --> 00:08:05.573]  And so were the Romans.
[00:08:06.373 --> 00:08:07.533]  And so were the Germans.
[00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.314]  And so were the Visigoths.
[00:08:09.734 --> 00:08:10.774]  And so were the Gauls.
[00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:12.415]  And so were the Chinese.
[00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:14.075]  And so were the Japanese.
[00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:17.216]  Every culture had slavery.
[00:08:17.236 --> 00:08:18.036]  You ever read a history book?
[00:08:19.997 --> 00:08:26.559]  But no one cares about liberated Libya by Al-Qaeda and ISIS that Hillary liberated and put in charge.
[00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:34.375]  And took out a truly progressive Islamic leader who actually had women going to college and no burqas and blacks lived in peace with Arabs.
[00:08:35.456 --> 00:08:37.478]  I just put USA Today on screen for TV viewers.
[00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:44.503]  Let's put that back up, where Africans are being sold at Libyan slave markets, thanks Hillary Clinton.
[00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.487]  So occasionally mainstream media actually gets it right.
[00:08:49.547 --> 00:08:55.252]  And I remember, was it Colbert, about a year ago, made a joke, he goes, what's a slave block?
[00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:07.912]  They made a joke on the comedy show, and I said, Hillary's responsible for Libya, and now they're selling women on slave blocks, and they go, what's a slave block?
[00:09:09.272 --> 00:09:10.573]  It's a block, it's what it's called.
[00:09:10.613 --> 00:09:12.473]  It's a big square block with steps.
[00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:16.434]  It's a pedestal for the goods.
[00:09:17.294 --> 00:09:19.154]  And in every major culture, you have slave blocks.
[00:09:19.634 --> 00:09:22.635]  And you march people up there, and a lot of times you take their clothes off.
[00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:25.256]  They're like, but wait, Islam, you gotta cover a woman.
[00:09:25.496 --> 00:09:26.557]  Not when you're buying a slave!
[00:09:27.477 --> 00:09:29.539]  They march those women up there butt-naked!
[00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:36.663]  And they sell them to Islamic brothels where they have sex with up to 100 men a day.
[00:09:39.224 --> 00:09:44.868]  When they get pregnant, they beat them with sticks until they have miscarriages so they can get back to business.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:52.784]  Now, that's the radical globalist Islam that Hillary Clinton has been funding and has been pushing.
[00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:56.147]  Every time they try to get good people into a country to actually stabilize it, they get removed.
[00:09:56.187 --> 00:10:07.916]  My point is, Taylor Swift talks about she's not going to vote for the Republicans in Tennessee for the first time becoming political, because she's under such pressure, because they didn't Tennessee values what happened with Kavanaugh.
[00:10:11.818 --> 00:10:16.002]  And Tennessee values, and all the rest of this, hey lady, you didn't Tennessee values
[00:10:18.584 --> 00:10:34.594]  The pedophilia in Hollywood, the mass abuse of women, the sexualization of children, and lying about Kavanaugh, and not having due process, and not having innocent until proven guilty, and not having the statute of limitations, which you guys want to get rid of?
[00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:38.436]  And then they went and looked at all the cases, and they were all bunk.
[00:10:39.056 --> 00:10:40.157]  They were all boulderdash.
[00:10:40.457 --> 00:10:42.258]  They were all baloney.
[00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.979]  They were all Bravo Sierra.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.100]  None of it added up.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.641]  None of the witnesses said it was true.
[00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:47.862]  It was all lies!
[00:10:48.953 --> 00:10:49.493]  Perjury!
[00:10:51.414 --> 00:10:55.117]  But she's got them Tennessee values of Taylor Swift.
[00:10:56.678 --> 00:10:59.879]  She isn't listening to her common sense or her mother or her father now.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.441]  No, she's the biggest star in the world.
[00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.483]  And she didn't want to go the way of Kanye.
[00:11:05.823 --> 00:11:10.586]  Like, Kanye was number one, and now he's only number two or number three because he got political, so now they're persecuting him.
[00:11:10.766 --> 00:11:12.667]  Well, that makes him a hero for standing up for what's right.
[00:11:12.947 --> 00:11:15.669]  I got a Kanye clip here, where
[00:11:16.994 --> 00:11:25.997]  A lot of this got censored off Saturday Night Live, but folks taped it, where he said the Democrats had a plan to pay black women who don't have their husbands in the house to get welfare, to destroy the black family.
[00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:27.998]  They go, oh, that's a crazy conspiracy theory.
[00:11:28.238 --> 00:11:31.979]  You're mentally ill, they said last Saturday night, the week after he was on.
[00:11:32.239 --> 00:11:32.799]  Make fun of him.
[00:11:33.179 --> 00:11:35.440]  We didn't bully you, but we wish we would have bullied you.
[00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:45.984]  LBJ wrote a whole string of letters you can pull up and read online at his own library, where he said these n-words are getting uppity.
[00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:50.177]  They own their own businesses, their own communities, and segregation's only made them stronger.
[00:11:51.618 --> 00:11:58.562]  We're going to desegregate, and I'm not saying that that was a bad thing, but the reason he did it was bad, and we're going to have these N-words voting Democrats for 100 years.
[00:11:59.723 --> 00:12:06.747]  And we are going to basically put the women in charge, get the men out of the home, and we'll have full control of these people.
[00:12:07.467 --> 00:12:09.649]  That's what they did.
[00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.292]  Black illegitimacy in the 40s.
[00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:19.284]  Was lower than white illegitimacy.
[00:12:19.624 --> 00:12:20.725]  Now it's over 80%.
[00:12:22.286 --> 00:12:24.287]  You say, oh, you're not being mean to single mothers, are you?
[00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:24.727]  No!
[00:12:24.747 --> 00:12:27.209]  A lot of them are great and do a great job.
[00:12:27.489 --> 00:12:32.912]  The point is, it's all geared to make men a bunch of lazy slobs and then women be wedded to the state.
[00:12:33.793 --> 00:12:39.796]  And if you're a single mother, your child, be it male or female, the numbers vary year to year and the crime statistics are what?
[00:12:40.256 --> 00:12:42.158]  Five times more likely to end up going to prison?
[00:12:43.109 --> 00:12:47.172]  Something like nine times more likely to end up taking drugs and being drug addicts.
[00:12:48.473 --> 00:12:52.036]  Many, many times more likely to end up dropping out of school.
[00:12:53.757 --> 00:12:55.979]  This was done by design.
[00:12:57.019 --> 00:13:01.423]  And then Hollywood and the gangster culture came in and weaponized the black community.
[00:13:02.571 --> 00:13:07.415]  And the black community was set up for the place where you allowed prostitution and you allowed drug dealing.
[00:13:07.775 --> 00:13:11.539]  That was done as a racist thing in Democrat establishment cities.
[00:13:12.299 --> 00:13:19.465]  The right-wing Christian Republican cities were the ones that went the other extreme and banned alcohol and wouldn't allow any red light districts.
[00:13:19.665 --> 00:13:30.755]  But the old Democrat areas of Chicago, New York, places like that, they're on record, folks, saying, just like in The Godfather, which is based on true stories, but they put it into a composite.
[00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:35.247]  Mario Puzo, you made that clear in articles you wrote.
[00:13:36.087 --> 00:13:41.489]  But remember, they're in the big commission meeting, and Don Corleone doesn't want drug dealing going on, period.
[00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:49.192]  Because we have the judges, they're our friends for alcohol and, you know, prostitution, things that are denied to them by the church, but we all do.
[00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:53.094]  But this drug business, I'm telling you, will be the end of it.
[00:13:53.774 --> 00:13:56.855]  Our friends in law enforcement and the courts are not going to go along with this.
[00:13:57.395 --> 00:13:58.716]  I'm telling you, it'll be the end of us.
[00:14:00.114 --> 00:14:01.654]  I agree with Don Corleone.
[00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:03.055]  We control it.
[00:14:03.495 --> 00:14:04.835]  Keep it in the colored areas.
[00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:07.236]  The animals, let them lose their souls.
[00:14:08.276 --> 00:14:08.776]  I didn't say that.
[00:14:08.796 --> 00:14:09.477]  That's the Godfather.
[00:14:09.657 --> 00:14:11.257]  But if Hollywood can say that, I can't.
[00:14:11.357 --> 00:14:11.917]  I'm quoting that.
[00:14:12.477 --> 00:14:13.318]  I don't believe they're animals.
[00:14:13.338 --> 00:14:14.438]  I don't believe they should lose their souls.
[00:14:14.898 --> 00:14:16.038]  We're all made in God's image.
[00:14:16.479 --> 00:14:18.139]  Like Martin Luther King said, and many others.
[00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:19.479]  Genesis.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.660]  But that's them telling you.
[00:14:23.356 --> 00:14:25.137]  That's them telling you.
[00:14:25.517 --> 00:14:26.618]  It's a plan.
[00:14:26.858 --> 00:14:30.139]  And here's Kanye talking about it and getting persecuted for it.
[00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:30.839]  Here it is.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:41.885]  That's what all these Democrats... You know, it's like a plan they did to take the fathers out of the home and promote welfare.
[00:14:42.545 --> 00:14:43.705]  Does anybody know about that?
[00:14:43.745 --> 00:14:44.746]  That's a Democratic plan.
[00:14:47.714 --> 00:14:48.755]  And it goes on from there.
[00:14:48.796 --> 00:14:50.177]  And that notice didn't air.
[00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:54.203]  It had to be shot behind the scenes, because they won't let Kanye go on live now.
[00:14:54.683 --> 00:14:55.885]  Because things are so controlled.
[00:14:56.045 --> 00:15:01.713]  And when Kanye came out and endorsed Donald Trump and Alex Jones, that same week, he said they're matrix breakers.
[00:15:01.813 --> 00:15:04.576]  Alex Jones and Donald Trump are matrix breakers.
[00:15:05.652 --> 00:15:07.873]  It was in news articles, and then they removed it.
[00:15:07.933 --> 00:15:14.377]  They didn't deny he said it, they removed the video before anybody could get it, and they removed it because they don't want that solidarity.
[00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:21.201]  I'm meant to be destroyed, Trump's meant to be destroyed, Kanye's meant to be destroyed, and little Taylor Swift runs out and says, Tennessee values.
[00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:23.722]  Lady, you make me sick.
[00:15:25.223 --> 00:15:26.824]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[00:15:27.724 --> 00:15:29.765]  One trillion infinities.
[00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:34.288]  The Democratic Party is the party of slavery and the KKK, and
[00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:40.615]  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and segregation made blacks stronger.
[00:15:40.875 --> 00:15:41.576]  I'm not defending it.
[00:15:41.596 --> 00:15:42.798]  It wasn't one evil.
[00:15:42.998 --> 00:15:46.743]  They replaced it with something even worse, leftist brainwashing in the end of their families.
[00:15:47.884 --> 00:15:49.446]  That's what they, and they're doing to everybody now.
[00:15:49.807 --> 00:15:51.469]  We'll be back with the really big news.
[00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:53.251]  Robots to be deployed to U.S.
[00:15:53.271 --> 00:15:54.393]  citizens' homes to watch you.
[00:15:55.305 --> 00:16:01.311]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:16:01.691 --> 00:16:04.294]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:08.338]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:16:08.598 --> 00:16:12.883]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:16:13.303 --> 00:16:16.566]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:16:17.467 --> 00:16:27.691]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:36.995]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:16:38.636 --> 00:16:47.199]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:16:52.200 --> 00:17:05.024]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.

[00:17:32.128 --> 00:17:34.172]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[00:17:34.512 --> 00:17:35.975]  Apple banned your app.
[00:17:36.115 --> 00:17:38.479]  I helped too!
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.321]  Ah, Oliver.
[00:17:46.038 --> 00:17:47.878]  We hate free speech too!
[00:17:47.938 --> 00:17:49.719]  We hate free speech!
[00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:51.499]  We hate free speech!
[00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:53.300]  We hate free speech!
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.120]  We hate free speech!
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.781]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:17:59.301 --> 00:18:02.042]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:08.383]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:18:08.843 --> 00:18:11.624]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:18:12.344 --> 00:18:15.808]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:18:16.168 --> 00:18:22.254]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:18:22.655 --> 00:18:27.620]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:18:28.362 --> 00:18:31.785]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:18:32.285 --> 00:18:38.830]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:18:39.491 --> 00:18:44.174]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:18:44.735 --> 00:18:49.818]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:54.382]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:18:58.055 --> 00:19:07.337]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[00:19:07.817 --> 00:19:18.840]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:25.103]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee bean.

[00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:30.950]  Scanning the scene of the city tonight.
[00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.691]  Looking for you to start up a fight!
[00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.491]  A little bit of old school Metallica from the Kill Em All album.
[00:20:57.392 --> 00:20:58.132]  She can.
[00:20:59.072 --> 00:21:00.213]  She can destroy.
[00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:05.695]  Or politically correct, search and clear.
[00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:11.337]  She can destroy.
[00:21:12.497 --> 00:21:14.318]  She can destroy globalist operations.
[00:21:16.178 --> 00:21:17.119]  She can destroy.
[00:21:17.699 --> 00:21:20.000]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:21:22.154 --> 00:21:23.136]  All over the world!
[00:21:28.322 --> 00:21:29.223]  Good stuff right there.
[00:21:29.243 --> 00:21:32.548]  And we're doing it through intellectual prowess.
[00:21:32.568 --> 00:21:36.453]  And we're doing it through determination and dogged true grit.
[00:21:37.935 --> 00:21:40.078]  The animating contest of liberty is now.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.080]  Let me do this.
[00:21:44.741 --> 00:21:54.265]  Let me be a good boy in this segment because it's so important I tell you what's coming up and not just digress because I say here's what's coming up and then I hit one stack and then I go off into that instead of saying what's coming up.
[00:21:54.545 --> 00:21:56.706]  So I'm going to discipline myself right now and I'm doing it.
[00:21:58.567 --> 00:21:59.087]  Top Den.
[00:21:59.788 --> 00:22:02.129]  Trump GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh.
[00:22:02.912 --> 00:22:03.432]  Politico.
[00:22:03.892 --> 00:22:07.034]  After failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[00:22:07.814 --> 00:22:12.356]  Taylor Swift bashes Blackburn in favor of Tennessee Dems, breaking political silence.
[00:22:13.757 --> 00:22:17.018]  Kanye West quits social media amid criticism for pro-Trump remarks.
[00:22:18.819 --> 00:22:22.340]  Brazil's Donald Trump wins overwhelming support in first round of presidential vote.
[00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:24.601]  After they almost killed him.
[00:22:25.242 --> 00:22:25.822]  Tough hombre.
[00:22:27.502 --> 00:22:30.844]  Asylum seeker brutally rapes child who was teaching him German.
[00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:34.214]  We're going to cover this first in a moment.
[00:22:34.514 --> 00:22:39.797]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room and watches you for your own good.
[00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:42.778]  It's an imperial probe droid.
[00:22:43.579 --> 00:22:44.979]  Good chance the Empire knows we're here.
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.700]  Better start the evacuation.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.122]  Instead, oh come on in my little copy taker.
[00:22:50.842 --> 00:22:51.643]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:22:53.144 --> 00:22:54.344]  Uh, Google's in trouble.
[00:22:54.604 --> 00:22:57.186]  Caught working with the Chi-Coms on their AI weapon system.
[00:22:57.546 --> 00:22:59.127]  They've been summoned to the Pentagon.
[00:22:59.963 --> 00:23:09.871]  to go tell him that we we're not going to work with America because we've all been trained to hate America but we're still your friend and pat him on the head so we'll see how that goes.
[00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:13.013]  Oh, it's getting better by the minute, isn't it?
[00:23:13.053 --> 00:23:14.034]  These people are crazy.
[00:23:14.574 --> 00:23:15.775]  So we're going to break all that down.
[00:23:17.256 --> 00:23:19.098]  Also, I didn't get to this yesterday but I'm going to cover it today.
[00:23:19.358 --> 00:23:21.960]  Microwave weapons are prime suspect in the ills of U.S.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.723]  Embassy and it's the same microwave relay frequency that G5's in.
[00:23:27.664 --> 00:23:28.625]  And there's even mainline
[00:23:31.377 --> 00:23:41.779]  Scientists coming out and saying that the new communication systems that they're coming out with are really mind control devices.
[00:23:42.819 --> 00:23:45.420]  You know, you can't make this stuff up.
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.540]  So we're going to be getting to more of all that coming up.
[00:23:54.701 --> 00:23:56.382]  We're showing footage of people getting hit with microwaves.
[00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:58.482]  We're going to be breaking more of this down coming up.
[00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:05.183]  And then we're obviously going to get into the Twitter trolls, the Google trolls, the Facebook trolls.
[00:24:05.223 --> 00:24:16.306]  They're now threatening to ban people and banning people if they say Christopher Columbus was a good guy, or George Washington was a good guy, or you quote Winston Churchill, you're bad.
[00:24:17.546 --> 00:24:23.267]  And, oh, we're not going to celebrate Columbus Day in Columbus, Ohio, and Austin's going to rename to some new name.
[00:24:24.208 --> 00:24:25.548]  It's Maya Angelou or something.
[00:24:27.202 --> 00:24:32.786]  Because if they can do that, they can get rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, because some of those people were slave owners.
[00:24:32.806 --> 00:24:34.587]  Well, that's what it is.
[00:24:35.848 --> 00:24:42.513]  They won't talk about sex slaves in Saudi Arabia, or black slaves in Africa right now, or how Christians in the West ended slavery in most areas of the world.
[00:24:42.813 --> 00:24:42.993]  No!
[00:24:43.253 --> 00:24:45.535]  Because we're the ones that ended it, we have the guilt.
[00:24:47.596 --> 00:24:56.483]  Then continuing, Kray's leftist tweet about ruining Kavanaugh's life gives us a window into their main game plan.
[00:24:57.807 --> 00:25:23.778]  And then that ties into, 29 days out, how they're pledging to still try to unseat Kavanaugh, but many Democrats are now saying, no, we're not gonna try to unseat him now, because they don't want any criminal investigations into the fantastical contradictions of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who, by the way, come back full circle,
[00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:35.445]  Writes papers on 5G-type wavelengths being used to soothe the mind of the average person.
[00:25:35.465 --> 00:25:39.909]  Isn't that crazy how it's just everywhere now?
[00:25:39.929 --> 00:25:40.530]  Mainstream news.
[00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.512]  Oh, 5G can control your brain.
[00:25:42.892 --> 00:25:43.653]  Oh, we're deploying it.
[00:25:43.773 --> 00:25:46.936]  Oh, little robots are going to be in your house and track and trace everything you do.
[00:25:47.296 --> 00:25:48.878]  That's coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:25:50.708 --> 00:26:03.492]  Because it's a new level of the rollout of the little home assistants that are watching you, listening to you, they're watching what you click, what you do, what you say, what you write, what you speak, but now they're gonna be watching you and tracking you openly!
[00:26:05.833 --> 00:26:07.493]  So that's all coming up next segment.
[00:26:08.273 --> 00:26:20.317]  Now I've got something that is a huge announcement that is extremely exciting, and I hope everyone listens up very, very clearly to this, because we've had a lot of big sales at InfoWareStore.com, but this is hands down the biggest we've ever had,
[00:26:21.693 --> 00:26:25.334]  And this was going to be the Christmas specials.
[00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:31.017]  But because, as you know, they've taken PayPal from us, they're trying to get our other payment processors.
[00:26:31.897 --> 00:26:35.038]  We're preparing all sorts of legal systems to that, obviously.
[00:26:35.398 --> 00:26:37.679]  This is the next, they want the NRA's payment processors.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.400]  They're saying they're going to kill members of Congress.
[00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:42.441]  The Democrats say they're going to get more ruthless.
[00:26:42.461 --> 00:26:44.102]  This is real racketeering.
[00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:53.304]  Combines, cartels, working in unison to punish people politically for wanting an American resurgence in free market and family values.
[00:26:53.344 --> 00:26:54.745]  This is true bullying.
[00:26:55.965 --> 00:27:03.948]  So to counter all that, I'm just going to go ahead and sell even all of our best-selling items and even things that are about to sell out or have already sold out.
[00:27:06.369 --> 00:27:12.431]  We are doing the Christmas Black Friday Cyber Monday all rolled into one for at least a week.
[00:27:14.736 --> 00:27:20.339]  On every supplement at InfoWarsLive.com and InfoWarsStore.com and many of the other items.
[00:27:20.379 --> 00:27:27.182]  Now, things like water filtration and air filtration, there's not even 50% in our profit and the maker's profit.
[00:27:27.202 --> 00:27:32.885]  I mean, like Alexa Pure Breeze, when we sell at $200, you know, we're making $50, they're making $50.
[00:27:33.645 --> 00:27:37.467]  When we sell at $150, we're making like $25, they're making $25.
[00:27:37.807 --> 00:27:39.888]  And leading competitors are $600, $700.
[00:27:40.188 --> 00:27:41.709]  And these are just as good.
[00:27:42.069 --> 00:27:43.110]  They just don't have all the markup in them.
[00:27:44.957 --> 00:27:46.038]  So that's my philosophy.
[00:27:46.078 --> 00:27:49.220]  So, everything is massively discounted.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:53.542]  There are some things that are 50% off because there's not even 50% markup in them.
[00:27:54.243 --> 00:27:54.663]  You understand?
[00:27:55.343 --> 00:27:56.804]  There's not even, it's not there.
[00:27:57.765 --> 00:28:04.069]  So, Happys, Brain Force, X2, even though it's the last run of X2, and even though we almost sold out all of it, you know what?
[00:28:04.169 --> 00:28:04.849]  It's 50% off.
[00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:09.112]  Because we're going to build our war chest.
[00:28:09.132 --> 00:28:12.234]  They want to shut down this year ahead of trying to destroy Trump.
[00:28:13.311 --> 00:28:18.296]  And so we need to fill our coffers that are running on the low end.
[00:28:18.616 --> 00:28:21.739]  You know, we're not on empty, we're not on reserve, but we can get there quick.
[00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:23.801]  So I need to do some massive re-air fueling.
[00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:29.386]  It's a great way for you to support the M4 War, stand up to these bullies, get great products, and go ahead and just buy your Christmas gifts.
[00:28:29.687 --> 00:28:37.414]  Go ahead and buy what you want of Happy's, or Brain Force, or Ultimate, Bone Broth, or Knockout, or the real Red Pill Plus.
[00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:38.134]  It's really amazing.
[00:28:38.895 --> 00:28:41.018]  Or X2 or Silver Bullet 50% off.
[00:28:41.258 --> 00:28:44.062]  Go ahead and stock up yourself and go ahead and do your Christmas shopping.
[00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:47.567]  Because quite frankly, you might be doing it by mail order if you wait.
[00:28:47.967 --> 00:28:50.511]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:50.711 --> 00:28:51.412]  They're trying to stop you.
[00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:51.952]  Don't let them.
[00:28:56.707 --> 00:28:58.328]  Joining us is Michael Graves.
[00:28:58.568 --> 00:29:01.550]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it.
[00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:02.471]  This is big news.
[00:29:02.551 --> 00:29:06.494]  Former Misfits singer, appearance canceled after social media review.
[00:29:06.694 --> 00:29:07.474]  Michael Graves.
[00:29:07.835 --> 00:29:13.278]  And this is a big deal, because they said, we reviewed him, and it's white supremacy and all this made-up crap.
[00:29:13.378 --> 00:29:16.720]  And so he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[00:29:16.761 --> 00:29:17.781]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[00:29:17.801 --> 00:29:19.662]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[00:29:19.883 --> 00:29:22.224]  Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[00:29:22.244 --> 00:29:24.626]  My tour manager is also my guitar player.
[00:29:25.466 --> 00:29:34.612]  And I, we had a day off and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened after the festival had posted it.
[00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:45.920]  That they had, like you said, reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.365]  Uh, from Breitbart, um, on and on.
[00:29:50.845 --> 00:29:58.355]  And it really is a sign of the times, Alex, because about 10 years ago, I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[00:29:58.375 --> 00:30:00.198]  It was called the War of Information Tour.
[00:30:01.182 --> 00:30:14.726]  And me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers that other patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from ordering through InfoWars.
[00:30:14.786 --> 00:30:18.267]  And we were disseminating the information and getting the word out.
[00:30:18.747 --> 00:30:20.127]  And no one said, boo.
[00:30:20.547 --> 00:30:23.728]  No one cared that what we were doing.
[00:30:24.288 --> 00:30:27.649]  Now jump to where we are in 2018 and
[00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.312]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[00:30:35.913 --> 00:30:42.596]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[00:30:42.677 --> 00:30:48.360]  And like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.641]  And we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that.
[00:30:52.081 --> 00:31:06.183]  You and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression, to hit the barbed wire as well.
[00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:14.245]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there, there's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists.
[00:31:14.966 --> 00:31:25.483]  And the attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover.
[00:31:27.054 --> 00:31:32.799]  For other artists, other musicians to do this regardless of the consequences.
[00:31:33.079 --> 00:31:39.664]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:45.769]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man and we really appreciate you and I look forward to having you back on.
[00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.170]  Alex, thank you.
[00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:51.594]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[00:31:51.974 --> 00:31:52.755]  Alex, thank you.
[00:31:52.935 --> 00:31:53.295]  Thank you.
[00:31:53.315 --> 00:31:53.716]  God bless you.

[00:32:58.883 --> 00:33:05.088]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.079 --> 00:33:24.344]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:26.013 --> 00:33:29.001]  Well, I don't want to say that the AP is plagiarizing me, but I...
[00:33:29.955 --> 00:33:30.375]  I like it.
[00:33:31.076 --> 00:33:31.917]  I like what they've said.
[00:33:31.937 --> 00:33:32.477]  I like what they've done.
[00:33:32.497 --> 00:33:33.798]  Maybe they just get the metaphor.
[00:33:34.419 --> 00:33:36.020]  But here's the headline from AP.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.425]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes.
[00:33:41.445 --> 00:33:48.971]  Because you know, metaphysically, evil has to trick you to invite it into your life.
[00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:53.935]  And then God will step aside and it can have its way with you.
[00:33:53.955 --> 00:33:55.917]  But that is a metaphysical rule of the universe.
[00:33:56.357 --> 00:33:58.659]  It's not just in vampire movies.
[00:34:03.985 --> 00:34:07.367]  Don't ever invite a vampire into your house, you silly boy.
[00:34:07.927 --> 00:34:09.047]  It renders you powerless.
[00:34:10.368 --> 00:34:11.008]  Did you know that?
[00:34:11.628 --> 00:34:12.069]  Of course.
[00:34:13.069 --> 00:34:13.849]  Everyone knows that.
[00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:16.310]  Has everyone gone crazy here?
[00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.771]  What's the matter with all of you?
[00:34:19.072 --> 00:34:21.673]  It was you I was after all along, Lucy.
[00:34:21.713 --> 00:34:21.973]  What?
[00:34:22.913 --> 00:34:29.876]  I knew that if I could get Sam and Michael into the family, there's no way you could say no.
[00:34:30.297 --> 00:34:30.977]  Where's Michael?
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.841]  It was all going to be so perfect, Lucy.
[00:34:34.202 --> 00:34:43.789]  Just like one big happy family.
[00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:47.312]  Your boys... and my boys.
[00:34:47.892 --> 00:34:48.152]  Great!
[00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.334]  The blood-sucking Brady Bunch!
[00:34:50.774 --> 00:34:52.976]  But I still want you, Lucy.
[00:34:55.717 --> 00:34:57.157]  I haven't changed my mind about that.
[00:34:57.177 --> 00:35:00.518]  I didn't invite you this time, Max.
[00:35:00.538 --> 00:35:03.898]  So, there's the metaphysical archetype, and that's what this is.
[00:35:03.938 --> 00:35:09.779]  And if you're dumb enough, you've already invited the smartphones in there, tracking and tracing everything you do, selling the data.
[00:35:10.039 --> 00:35:11.040]  They're already censoring.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.260]  iPhones won't even let you go to our RSS feed.
[00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.060]  On my website, that's a link.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.581]  They've hijacked it at the URL level.
[00:35:19.521 --> 00:35:25.002]  They won't let you send emojis of Taiwan and their flag, or the name Taiwan, in China.
[00:35:26.178 --> 00:35:29.580]  And Google and Apple all over there, yay, yay, we love it!
[00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:34.184]  And now, they want you to fully embrace it.
[00:35:34.284 --> 00:35:51.056]  Remember how I, 20 years ago, was in several documentaries like Secret Rulers of the World and others, and I remember being made fun of when I was on several national programs, and I pointed out that I had a tape over the webcam in my house.
[00:35:52.148 --> 00:35:56.412]  And then later, people noticed Zuckerberg, five years ago, had his webcam covered.
[00:35:56.432 --> 00:35:57.253]  And again, two years ago.
[00:35:57.293 --> 00:35:59.214]  And so did Comey, and people asked him why.
[00:35:59.234 --> 00:36:01.637]  And he said, well, folks can hack in and watch and listen.
[00:36:02.357 --> 00:36:09.664]  It's the big tech companies, and they've already gotten away with all this, so why shouldn't they try to get away with more?
[00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:25.055]  Because remember, what Zuckerberg said when he was getting investors to have Facebook go public, and he was at the Bilderberg Group, and parts of it over the years leaked, and he said in multiple emails, he said, I can't believe how effing dumb people are.
[00:36:25.615 --> 00:36:28.116]  They effing trust us, the dumb effers.
[00:36:29.656 --> 00:36:31.337]  Very big little potty mouth on him.
[00:36:31.777 --> 00:36:32.537]  But look, he's a predator!
[00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.538]  Has a little psychotic smile.
[00:36:35.578 --> 00:36:42.723]  And so, he's selling your data, they're trading your data, they're listening, they're watching, all the Facebook apps, the Google apps.
[00:36:43.103 --> 00:36:56.011]  It came out 10 years ago that the Google cars drive around with those antennas and grab all your personal data and your passcodes, and then they transfer the data offshore, then they have third parties break into all your stuff and sell it.
[00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:58.613]  And now they officially help China, Google and Apple,
[00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:07.593]  With surveillance grids and censorship grids and censorship apps that the public has to have in order to even have a smartphone.
[00:37:09.093 --> 00:37:11.814]  They built it, what, in 2006.
[00:37:13.314 --> 00:37:16.195]  They got caught over there in China.
[00:37:16.475 --> 00:37:16.835]  Google did.
[00:37:17.916 --> 00:37:19.336]  And so they backed off for a while.
[00:37:19.816 --> 00:37:22.757]  So everything you hear about Dragonfly, all this stuff is old news.
[00:37:25.205 --> 00:37:26.386]  So, why was I banned?
[00:37:26.446 --> 00:37:30.710]  The biggest thing ahead of the midterms was I was making this a central issue, and I knew I was getting information from the President.
[00:37:32.112 --> 00:37:35.775]  But now you see it's the big number one issue, and I have an article that I forgot to get out of the printer.
[00:37:36.076 --> 00:37:37.257]  You guys bring that to me, please.
[00:37:37.437 --> 00:37:38.238]  Thank you so much.
[00:37:38.798 --> 00:37:41.401]  The White House Chief Economic Advisor warns U.S.
[00:37:41.441 --> 00:37:43.683]  companies not to invest in China.
[00:37:44.904 --> 00:37:47.787]  That's the Associated Press as well.
[00:37:49.673 --> 00:37:51.294]  Didn't get printed, it's no big deal.
[00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:54.675]  About 10 minutes ago during the break, I was in there and I said, this printed wrong.
[00:37:55.256 --> 00:37:56.956]  Can I please have it?
[00:37:58.277 --> 00:38:00.618]  If not, Daniels can come back in and give it to me again.
[00:38:00.658 --> 00:38:03.499]  I know he tried to give it to me and I will just read the one that's cut off.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.220]  It's fine.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.401]  Or we can search engine, I can do it.
[00:38:07.781 --> 00:38:10.182]  I'll do it myself if I have to, no big deal.
[00:38:10.363 --> 00:38:15.565]  But I want to show people this because I need that little critical piece of intel.
[00:38:18.404 --> 00:38:21.266]  I just want that one little piece that I needed.
[00:38:21.366 --> 00:38:22.246]  Just that one thing.
[00:38:22.266 --> 00:38:23.807]  I just need it so badly.
[00:38:24.548 --> 00:38:27.550]  Oh my God, I'm out of now.
[00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.011]  I've become OCD.
[00:38:29.071 --> 00:38:30.051]  It is a serious problem now.
[00:38:30.852 --> 00:38:36.835]  Now, stay away from China, White House top economic economist tells U.S.
[00:38:36.895 --> 00:38:37.396]  businesses.
[00:38:38.899 --> 00:38:41.701]  It's Yahoo Finance, AP, Bloomberg are all reporting it.
[00:38:42.102 --> 00:38:45.224]  Stay away from China, White House top economist tells U.S.
[00:38:45.264 --> 00:38:45.745]  businesses.
[00:38:46.025 --> 00:38:47.846]  We're going to get to more of that in the next segment.
[00:38:48.146 --> 00:38:52.470]  But right now, let me give you the big drum roll and the big news, because you know how I do it.
[00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:57.894]  I tend to give you the background news first, just to remind you of the history and the rest of it.
[00:38:58.095 --> 00:38:59.476]  I know most of you know more than I do.
[00:38:59.576 --> 00:39:01.037]  I'm just, it's for the new viewers.
[00:39:01.057 --> 00:39:02.158]  They're the really important people.
[00:39:03.746 --> 00:39:05.007]  It's like the lost sheep scenario.
[00:39:05.027 --> 00:39:07.649]  Why would you spend so much time with this little sheep when you've got thousands of them?
[00:39:07.669 --> 00:39:10.070]  Because that's why I have thousands, is I try to take care of the sheep.
[00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:12.372]  And it's the prodigal son.
[00:39:13.373 --> 00:39:18.476]  The bad, spoiled son goes away, spends his inheritance, comes back five years later totally broke and brain dead.
[00:39:19.917 --> 00:39:26.462]  And the father kills the top cow, the juiciest cow, and has a big party and orders a huge celebration.
[00:39:27.042 --> 00:39:29.564]  And the good son says, Dad, you never did any of this for me.
[00:39:31.383 --> 00:39:36.147]  Imagine how big the party would be for you when you're way better than your younger son if you came back.
[00:39:36.187 --> 00:39:37.688]  Buddy, I love you a lot more than him.
[00:39:38.188 --> 00:39:40.250]  But we don't need to do all that for you.
[00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:43.312]  We're celebrating this fact that your brother's back.
[00:39:44.212 --> 00:39:48.015]  You don't need to have the big celebration to make you understand you're part of the family.
[00:39:48.255 --> 00:39:49.576]  You're smarter than he is.
[00:39:49.777 --> 00:39:50.777]  You've got the birthright.
[00:39:50.957 --> 00:39:52.378]  You get everything when I die.
[00:39:52.819 --> 00:39:54.140]  I didn't need to do that.
[00:39:56.291 --> 00:39:57.652]  That's why you're the number one son.
[00:39:57.792 --> 00:39:59.193]  And he's like, oh, I get it.
[00:39:59.873 --> 00:40:00.594]  You see how that works?
[00:40:01.094 --> 00:40:04.116]  We're trying to wake up the victims of this stuff before it's too late.
[00:40:04.737 --> 00:40:05.737]  That's who we're targeting.
[00:40:07.258 --> 00:40:09.360]  The targets, the ones that globalists are feeding on.
[00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:10.761]  Excuse me, let me get back to this.
[00:40:12.382 --> 00:40:18.486]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes.
[00:40:21.144 --> 00:40:28.105]  It's what you've already done, ladies and gentlemen, but now they're just throwing it in your face, and they say, oh, it watches you, it listens to you, it gives recommendations.
[00:40:28.445 --> 00:40:31.786]  It's never off, and it's gonna run your life.
[00:40:32.366 --> 00:40:39.347]  Imagine if I showed up at your house with a camera, and I said, you know, I'm just gonna put this camera in your house and watch you, and I'm only one guy.
[00:40:39.567 --> 00:40:41.927]  You'd flip out and say you're crazy, get off my front porch.
[00:40:42.348 --> 00:40:50.569]  But if it's Zuckerberg that says you're a dumb effort, and it's all tied into everything else, and it gets better, he's joined Google and Apple in AI development,
[00:40:51.289 --> 00:41:03.372]  In China, and they helped put spy chips in the Apple products to help China steal all your data, including the Pentagon and the NSA, and they jacked into everything, and the Office of Personnel Management hack.
[00:41:03.872 --> 00:41:06.093]  That's why Zuckerberg and none of them respect us.
[00:41:08.313 --> 00:41:11.534]  They've already gotten away with everything.
[00:41:12.915 --> 00:41:13.855]  We are a joke.
[00:41:15.572 --> 00:41:17.094]  And they're all American haters.
[00:41:17.134 --> 00:41:25.764]  They're corporations and bureaucracies who got together when America had half the wealth 50 years ago, and they said, let's sell this son of a gun out.
[00:41:26.826 --> 00:41:31.271]  And they built up China and India and 100 plus other countries, but not their people.
[00:41:31.451 --> 00:41:32.633]  The middle classes got smaller.
[00:41:34.235 --> 00:41:34.575]  On average.
[00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.026]  Because they want a giant sucking sound.
[00:41:37.046 --> 00:41:39.527]  They don't want to build a middle class like Ross Perot did.
[00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:46.189]  They want this actuary plan to steal everything and then make you poor so there's no middle class to threaten them.
[00:41:46.429 --> 00:41:47.909]  They are monsters!
[00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:49.570]  They are selfish!
[00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:54.811]  They are cultural, spiritual, genetic psychopath monsters.
[00:41:56.472 --> 00:41:58.312]  And they are wildly criminal.
[00:41:58.852 --> 00:42:01.433]  Oh, but they ban the Nazis off the web.
[00:42:01.493 --> 00:42:02.973]  And then next it's Alex Jones.
[00:42:03.233 --> 00:42:03.794]  And then it's you.
[00:42:04.074 --> 00:42:04.834]  And then it's the NRA.
[00:42:06.289 --> 00:42:07.710]  Oh, and they're virtue signaling.
[00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:18.039]  Oh, we're, you know, teaching people gender fluidity here at Google and some executives make people call them dragonettes in beautiful ornate buildings.
[00:42:18.439 --> 00:42:24.764]  It's all just training people for mental illness and how to submit to pure evil.
[00:42:25.145 --> 00:42:27.347]  So I'll play you some of the video inside your home.
[00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:30.595]  With the portal, it's called.
[00:42:30.675 --> 00:42:31.796]  Yes, the portal!
[00:42:32.176 --> 00:42:43.168]  Oh, let's put from Facebook and Apple and Google and the Chi-Coms, the AI portal, directly in our house with all this little imperial probe droid eyes, hooked into the big AI systems.
[00:42:43.248 --> 00:42:44.649]  That's a great idea!
[00:42:45.671 --> 00:42:48.313]  Why don't you let Jeffrey Dahmer babysit your kids, too?
[00:42:48.694 --> 00:42:50.556]  That might get you a better result.
[00:42:57.538 --> 00:42:59.643]  33% of the population of the U.S.
[00:42:59.863 --> 00:43:02.489]  That's 2 out of every 3 people you're looking at.
[00:43:03.306 --> 00:43:06.748]  carry staph aureus bacteria in their nose.
[00:43:07.428 --> 00:43:13.352]  Two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin-resistant staph.
[00:43:13.892 --> 00:43:19.675]  Now what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than AIDS.
[00:43:20.115 --> 00:43:28.460]  And so what we do is we work really hard, did mass amounts of research, and we found that our gel, your gel,
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.801]  As a first line of defense, it's amazing.
[00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:40.206]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that will last up to three days.
[00:43:40.986 --> 00:43:47.530]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph, E. coli, Candida, Aspergillus niger, in minutes.
[00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:54.414]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field
[00:43:55.535 --> 00:44:05.003]  And ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a Methicillin Resistant Staph Bacteria, from that soccer field.
[00:44:05.684 --> 00:44:13.792]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephones, in subways.
[00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:24.756]  And this gel that you have access to is the first line of defense for everybody to be able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria.
[00:44:25.056 --> 00:44:37.121]  You gel it up and you don't worry about it because we have heal rates of about half the normal time and you actually have something now in your house where you can easily take care of it.
[00:44:37.785 --> 00:44:50.434]  I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time because explain why the super silver wound gel dressing from Infowarslife.com that we probably labeled from your top of the line, your top selling product nationwide, why is it so special?
[00:44:50.914 --> 00:44:59.641]  These studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes down 24 hours with no negative effect on any system in your body.
[00:45:00.061 --> 00:45:02.783]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[00:45:03.587 --> 00:45:04.328]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[00:45:04.348 --> 00:45:13.216]  The over-the-counter, which is what you have, available to your people, is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[00:45:13.496 --> 00:45:16.238]  You have one of the only products in the U.S.
[00:45:16.318 --> 00:45:20.322]  that can, like, make a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[00:45:20.742 --> 00:45:26.608]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about, probably, three or four minutes.
[00:45:27.268 --> 00:45:30.091]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:34.135]  What a blessing to have something that you have in your house right now.
[00:45:34.355 --> 00:45:36.617]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this.
[00:45:36.838 --> 00:45:49.370]  So hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were caused in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:55.551]  That's why they're going back to the silver products, because our silver is proven to kill those.
[00:45:56.091 --> 00:46:02.433]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are Methicillin-resistant Staph, and one called VRE.
[00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:07.194]  And VRE is Ventomycin-resistant Enterococcus Fecalis.
[00:46:07.394 --> 00:46:09.814]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[00:46:10.394 --> 00:46:13.295]  And so the cool part is, this gel kills it in minutes.
[00:46:14.017 --> 00:46:23.463]  So you don't have to worry about your kid getting an amputation or wound or you don't have to have, you know, a funeral for somebody you love.
[00:46:23.483 --> 00:46:35.470]  And the bottom line is you guys did years and years and years and years and years and years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies and you finally found out the perfect silver, the most effective, and it's available at Infowarsstore.com and you helped save the country.
[00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:37.851]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:17.433 --> 00:47:18.093]  Big Brother.
[00:47:18.574 --> 00:47:19.814]  Mainstream media.
[00:47:20.355 --> 00:47:21.495]  Government cover-ups.
[00:47:22.236 --> 00:47:23.737]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:23.957 --> 00:47:25.078]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:25.638 --> 00:47:30.381]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:33.483]  Princess, we have a visitor.
[00:47:34.704 --> 00:47:37.285]  He picked up something outside the base zone 12 moving east.
[00:47:37.646 --> 00:47:38.046]  It's metal.
[00:47:38.446 --> 00:47:39.707]  Then it couldn't be one of those creatures.
[00:47:39.827 --> 00:47:41.048]  Could be a speeder, one of ours.
[00:47:41.708 --> 00:47:41.888]  No.
[00:47:43.429 --> 00:47:43.649]  Wait.
[00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:45.610]  There's something very weak coming through.
[00:47:50.032 --> 00:47:52.734]  Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication.
[00:47:53.054 --> 00:47:54.735]  This signal is not used by the Alliance.
[00:47:54.975 --> 00:47:56.096]  It could be an Imperial code.
[00:48:02.156 --> 00:48:03.238]  It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
[00:48:03.258 --> 00:48:04.300]  Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.
[00:48:37.876 --> 00:48:44.823]  Fred, there's not much left.
[00:48:45.003 --> 00:48:45.523]  What was it?
[00:48:45.603 --> 00:48:46.484]  A droid of some kind.
[00:48:46.504 --> 00:48:47.665]  I didn't hit it that hard.
[00:48:47.685 --> 00:48:49.007]  It must have had a self-destruct.
[00:48:49.627 --> 00:48:50.968]  An Imperial probe droid.
[00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:53.551]  It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.
[00:48:54.452 --> 00:48:55.753]  We better start the evacuation.
[00:49:01.394 --> 00:49:06.619]  Oh, but Mark Zuckerberg, he's just building AI with Google and Apple and China and helping round everyone up.
[00:49:07.099 --> 00:49:12.224]  And Tim Cook's in the front of major papers saying, I support Chinese censorship and I want it in America.
[00:49:12.664 --> 00:49:15.106]  And taking Jones off hundreds of platforms at once.
[00:49:15.847 --> 00:49:18.409]  Well, it's called curation.
[00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:20.772]  We're curating everything.
[00:49:20.852 --> 00:49:25.276]  And just bring this into your house and just be a trusting, crazy soy boy.
[00:49:28.339 --> 00:49:28.799]  Why?
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:33.203]  I want to put a little thing in there that watches you and tracks you with AI technology!
[00:49:35.145 --> 00:49:35.705]  Trust me!
[00:49:36.566 --> 00:49:37.847]  I'm not the American Psycho!
[00:49:37.867 --> 00:49:41.510]  Hi ladies, would you like to... You're hitchhiking I see.
[00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.631]  Would you like to get in the car with me?
[00:49:43.792 --> 00:49:45.654]  What planet are we on?
[00:49:46.995 --> 00:49:49.337]  Our users trust us, dumb effers.
[00:49:51.238 --> 00:49:52.700]  So there's a little Zuckerberg.
[00:49:54.019 --> 00:49:55.320]  And I can joke around about it.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:57.101]  This is deadly serious.
[00:49:57.121 --> 00:50:15.295]  You see, it's the over-the-topness of big tech, the globalists, under Obama, under Hillary, under the big plan, moving all the tech to China, giving them all our military secrets, allowing them to put spy tech in all the major consumer electronics and phones, which I told you 10 years ago.
[00:50:16.416 --> 00:50:21.000]  We wrote articles 10 years ago giving you exactly what was happening.
[00:50:22.912 --> 00:50:24.213]  And that's why I'm the number one enemy.
[00:50:24.513 --> 00:50:26.794]  I told you they're buying the debt before it became big news.
[00:50:27.255 --> 00:50:29.556]  Because I was reading the CFR like 15 years ago.
[00:50:29.576 --> 00:50:31.057]  They said, we're going to position the U.S.
[00:50:31.077 --> 00:50:33.479]  as a debtor to China, transfer everything so the U.S.
[00:50:33.519 --> 00:50:34.239]  has to capitulate.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:38.602]  So we can have an orderly ascendance of the Chinese century.
[00:50:38.962 --> 00:50:39.602]  These are quotes.
[00:50:40.283 --> 00:50:44.065]  I'm reading this going, this is from David Rockefeller.
[00:50:44.345 --> 00:50:45.946]  It's from these jerks!
[00:50:47.648 --> 00:50:49.529]  And then I started talking to high-level Hollywood folks.
[00:50:50.894 --> 00:50:52.915]  They're like, oh yeah, the Chinese are buying everything up.
[00:50:53.576 --> 00:50:54.576]  And now that's mainstream news.
[00:50:54.676 --> 00:50:55.397]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:50:55.717 --> 00:50:56.737]  China now owns Hollywood.
[00:50:58.518 --> 00:51:01.220]  And it's insane what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.481]  And now they're financing the Arab Spring against us.
[00:51:04.141 --> 00:51:04.982]  They are our enemies.
[00:51:05.642 --> 00:51:11.185]  And that's why the White House has come out and told companies, you better abandon China.
[00:51:11.445 --> 00:51:17.789]  And now even the establishment's going, okay, it's hard to give up on them, but you're right, because your check made it.
[00:51:19.648 --> 00:51:30.113]  Just because Obama and Hillary and everybody finished the process of transferring everything to China, you didn't get the presidency to put the cherry on top and now the rug's being pulled out from under you.
[00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:37.076]  You got this big dinner table set and Trump walked over and he's not pulling the tablecloth off that trick and leaving stuff on the table.
[00:51:37.096 --> 00:51:41.277]  Remember my dad, when I was a kid, did that once in front of me and only one glass fell over?
[00:51:41.537 --> 00:51:42.478]  My mother was impressed.
[00:51:42.918 --> 00:51:45.199]  We're watching a movie or something and they didn't move my leg.
[00:51:45.279 --> 00:51:45.840]  I can do that!
[00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:49.282]  Like the next day we're about to have dinner and my leg goes like pulls the whole thing off.
[00:51:49.302 --> 00:51:52.424]  But the point is, Trump's not doing it where the stuff stays on.
[00:51:52.444 --> 00:51:53.884]  He's just dragging it all off the table.
[00:51:54.165 --> 00:51:55.565]  How do you like that, globalist?
[00:51:55.886 --> 00:51:57.987]  And they're crapping their dirty little britches.
[00:51:58.967 --> 00:52:01.349]  This is a time to say hip hip hooray!
[00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.990]  Frabjous day!
[00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:04.270]  Kaloo kalay!
[00:52:05.311 --> 00:52:08.513]  We have slain the Jabberwocky that went floofle as it went.
[00:52:09.113 --> 00:52:10.354]  But I have not gotten to that yet.
[00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.095]  Continuing here.
[00:52:13.732 --> 00:52:14.353]  This is critical.
[00:52:15.013 --> 00:52:17.456]  Facebook wants people to invite its cameras into their homes!
[00:52:17.856 --> 00:52:18.377]  AP!
[00:52:18.797 --> 00:52:19.798]  Infowars.com!
[00:52:20.979 --> 00:52:23.562]  New Facebook portal camera follows you around the room!
[00:52:23.662 --> 00:52:26.144]  Gee, I bet this won't be used to spy on everyone!
[00:52:26.925 --> 00:52:31.209]  And let's go ahead and go to the little promo piece with a bunch of soy boys smiling all the way!
[00:52:31.489 --> 00:52:31.970]  Here it is!
[00:52:33.038 --> 00:52:35.719]  Meet Portal and Portal Plus from Facebook.
[00:52:36.579 --> 00:52:39.080]  A new way to connect that makes you feel like you're in the same room.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.100]  Hey!
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:45.302]  Portal's smart camera follows the action, keeping you in frame and everyone in view.
[00:52:46.802 --> 00:52:50.103]  Smart sound focuses on your voice, minimizing the rest.
[00:52:50.443 --> 00:52:51.504]  That's what it's supposed to do.
[00:52:51.524 --> 00:52:52.564]  That was right in everything.
[00:52:52.584 --> 00:52:53.965]  With Portal, you stay in control.
[00:52:54.325 --> 00:52:58.466]  Disable the camera and microphone with a single tap, or flip the cover over the camera lens.
[00:52:59.258 --> 00:53:04.960]  You can connect with your closest contacts from Facebook and Messenger, even if they don't have Portal.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.981]  And when you're not in a call, Portal displays photos, videos, and events.
[00:53:09.762 --> 00:53:15.544]  And Portal has Amazon Alexa built in, so you can ask a question, check the weather, or set the mood.
[00:53:16.064 --> 00:53:17.284]  Alexa, dim the lights.
[00:53:19.645 --> 00:53:22.606]  Portal is a whole new way to spend more time with your favorite people.
[00:53:23.026 --> 00:53:27.448]  Hey guys, bring me... I know we got the older Alexas around here for jokes, but can we bring one in here later?
[00:53:27.468 --> 00:53:28.528]  I want to tell it to kill itself.
[00:53:29.633 --> 00:53:31.775]  I want to ask about the Chinese Communist and stuff like that.
[00:53:33.296 --> 00:53:38.119]  But seriously, you notice, oh, it dials in on your voice with voice print.
[00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.521]  Yeah, it can listen to you in three rooms away.
[00:53:41.161 --> 00:53:52.190]  The Kinect systems nine years ago, eight years ago, admitted that they could see through your walls using basically a form of radar, sound waves.
[00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:57.994]  I mean, these things are Trojan horses of Trojan horses, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:59.065 --> 00:54:03.166]  And so, sounds great, but you know who the company is.
[00:54:03.466 --> 00:54:04.347]  Is this great for your business?
[00:54:04.387 --> 00:54:04.667]  Yeah.
[00:54:05.627 --> 00:54:08.308]  You just better not have it plugged in all the time or be around it.
[00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:19.652]  You better treat it like a giant rattlesnake in your house, because it'd be one thing if it was a security company, trusted, that had a long history of not letting anybody get into their data, and then, you know, this is just for, you know, for your security or whatever.
[00:54:20.172 --> 00:54:23.053]  It's Zuckerberg, man, in bed with the GICOMS!
[00:54:27.065 --> 00:54:34.890]  It'd be like randomly getting an email from some Nigerian prince or something saying, you know, they're saving people from human smugglers or something.
[00:54:35.131 --> 00:54:37.092]  You know the Nigerians are the biggest scammers ever.
[00:54:37.312 --> 00:54:40.815]  You know their national product is scamming people over the internet.
[00:54:41.115 --> 00:54:48.260]  That'd be like coming home and your wife, you know, has brought the Nigerian prince delegation into your house and all they need is a million dollars to save the children.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:50.281]  But this is more dangerous than that.
[00:54:50.501 --> 00:54:51.202]  It's Zuckerberg!
[00:54:53.336 --> 00:54:54.577]  You know, they go, oh, be politically correct.
[00:54:54.777 --> 00:54:58.920]  Yes, the gypsy culture of many Romanov gypsies is to rob the cultures around them.
[00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:03.304]  But let's just, you know, bring a gypsy caravan and let them move into your house for a month.
[00:55:03.604 --> 00:55:04.745]  Nothing's going to get stolen.
[00:55:04.965 --> 00:55:06.226]  Your kids aren't going to get kidnapped.
[00:55:06.607 --> 00:55:10.670]  This is more dangerous than bringing a hundred Romanov gypsies into your house.
[00:55:16.778 --> 00:55:18.298]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[00:55:18.318 --> 00:55:18.999]  We're going to come back.
[00:55:19.139 --> 00:55:22.479]  I've got a great, incredible Millie Weaver, well down to the insanity of the leftist.
[00:55:22.499 --> 00:55:23.440]  She's going to be joining us later.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.340]  We have several big guests as well.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.081]  I want to get into the left pledging more violence.
[00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:31.042]  Democrats in Politico talking about getting more ruthless.
[00:55:32.082 --> 00:55:33.482]  They've gone full authoritarian.
[00:55:36.703 --> 00:55:38.263]  You don't ever want to go full retard.
[00:55:38.703 --> 00:55:40.744]  Well, they've gone full authoritarian.
[00:55:42.892 --> 00:55:43.632]  So that's coming up.
[00:55:43.852 --> 00:55:45.293]  Critical intel straight ahead.
[00:55:45.313 --> 00:55:46.654]  A ton of clips I haven't gotten to.
[00:55:46.714 --> 00:55:47.895]  Trump on fire this weekend.
[00:55:48.215 --> 00:55:51.376]  Talking about Denang, Dick, Blumenthal, and so much more.
[00:55:52.237 --> 00:55:56.839]  But that said, we have launched the biggest sale in our history that we're planning for Christmas.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:05.624]  But because they're racing to try to shut us down, all the rest of it, it's absolutely critical that you get your shopping in now and your Christmas shopping.
[00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:10.492]  So, we're launching the Christmas Black Friday Cyber Monday all rolled into one.
[00:56:10.632 --> 00:56:11.352]  All the specials.
[00:56:11.932 --> 00:56:16.194]  We were planning for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas.
[00:56:16.815 --> 00:56:17.915]  And we're still around then.
[00:56:18.235 --> 00:56:18.655]  Seriously.
[00:56:19.096 --> 00:56:20.056]  I've got good cheer about this.
[00:56:20.436 --> 00:56:21.597]  We've already devastated the globalists.
[00:56:21.677 --> 00:56:23.058]  And I hope we'll be around.
[00:56:23.278 --> 00:56:24.438]  I'm sure in some permutation.
[00:56:25.159 --> 00:56:29.621]  But you need to get the products now and support the broadcast so we can be bunkered in.
[00:56:29.701 --> 00:56:30.381]  Hunkered in.
[00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:31.822]  Supply the Alamo.
[00:56:31.862 --> 00:56:33.142]  We promise we won't give up.
[00:56:33.463 --> 00:56:36.184]  But it'd be good to have a little bacon and a little beans.
[00:56:38.442 --> 00:56:40.523]  To whip the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.
[00:56:41.143 --> 00:56:42.604]  So, they hate you supporting us.
[00:56:42.624 --> 00:56:43.504]  You get great products.
[00:56:43.544 --> 00:56:45.745]  You beat the globalists.
[00:56:45.765 --> 00:56:47.446]  50% off all InfoWars Live products.
[00:56:47.606 --> 00:56:48.426]  Super sale!

[00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:57.110]  And did I forget?
[00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:58.690]  Because we probably want to add that or scroll down.
[00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:00.011]  Is it on there that there's free shipping?
[00:57:00.791 --> 00:57:01.272]  There it is!
[00:57:01.412 --> 00:57:01.772]  It's there!

[00:57:10.524 --> 00:57:13.566]  And yeah, we're getting close to selling out Rainforce and X2, our last run.

[00:57:14.286 --> 00:57:14.907]  It's very popular.
[00:57:14.927 --> 00:57:15.227]  It's amazing.
[00:57:15.487 --> 00:57:16.508]  Knockout, got a lot of that.
[00:57:17.288 --> 00:57:19.330]  X2, again, that's running out.
[00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:22.592]  Bodies just came back into stock.

[00:58:03.516 --> 00:58:04.277]  You laughed at me.
[00:58:08.661 --> 00:58:11.043]  You've been in love with something else your whole life.
[00:58:11.964 --> 00:58:12.905]  And this is a love affair.
[00:58:14.347 --> 00:58:16.729]  And so, I'm not gonna get in bed with you.
[00:58:19.311 --> 00:58:21.574]  Because you don't love the spirit of justice.
[00:58:22.314 --> 00:58:24.196]  You love your father the devil.
[00:58:25.658 --> 00:58:27.920]  You love death more than life.
[00:58:29.127 --> 00:58:33.754]  So you go with your father forever.
[00:58:34.274 --> 00:58:34.915]  And that's hell.
[00:58:35.436 --> 00:58:36.458]  Separation from God.
[00:58:38.817 --> 00:58:38.957]  NEVER!
[00:58:38.977 --> 00:58:39.717]  NEVER DEFEAT THE HUMAN SPIRIT!
[00:58:39.857 --> 00:58:40.497]  YOU'LL NEVER DEFEAT GOD!
[00:58:40.517 --> 00:58:40.998]  YOU'LL NEVER WIN!
[00:58:41.018 --> 00:58:41.138]  NEVER!
[00:58:41.158 --> 00:58:41.578]  NEVER EVER!
[00:58:41.598 --> 00:58:42.338]  AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET TESTED!
[00:58:42.358 --> 00:58:43.238]  SO REJOICE TO GOD ALMIGHTY!
[00:58:43.258 --> 00:59:04.684]  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[00:59:31.741 --> 00:59:33.161]  It's Bolivia!
[00:59:33.181 --> 00:59:36.142]  No, it's Alex Jones, and he's super pissed!
[00:59:36.302 --> 00:59:53.426]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:08.308 --> 01:00:11.649]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:12.349 --> 01:00:14.270]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:27.012]  So, you know, they always say when they kick you off Google, Facebook, Twitter, when they only put the negative results up about you if you're Donald Trump or Alex Jones at the top, they always say, oh, just build your own thing.
[01:00:28.775 --> 01:00:38.003]  And then they come after your credit card processors, they come after the very software you use on your website, they come after your very internet service providers, and then they come after your payment processors, everything.
[01:00:38.884 --> 01:00:51.474]  So Andrew Torb at the bottom of the hour from Gab, which again is just a free speech site, so you've got black nationalists, white nationalists, you know maybe that's 5% of the site, but then you've got just regular conservatives, libertarians, liberals, it's a free-for-all!
[01:00:52.055 --> 01:00:54.217]  As long as you don't, remember how the internet used to be?
[01:00:55.936 --> 01:01:00.039]  Long as you don't call for killing anybody or you're not selling methamphetamine or whatever.
[01:01:00.059 --> 01:01:03.903]  You can do it, but then they can come into your site and say, look, a Nazi!
[01:01:03.963 --> 01:01:10.828]  And they have the leftist groups call up and go, oh my God, they can't have a donate button on their website.
[01:01:11.249 --> 01:01:12.150]  Take that away!
[01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:14.071]  And you'll get another process company.
[01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:15.112]  Take that away!
[01:01:15.152 --> 01:01:21.898]  And then the Democrats just have a way, even though it's not public who you're using, they know because they have the Justice Department.
[01:01:22.605 --> 01:01:31.949]  It's nice to have some FBI agents with reality winners political views in there and that's what Project Veritas shows.
[01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:46.757]  They're in there and they're doxing Congress and doxing and it's just fun giving ISIS blueprints and just, you know, and Google's helping China build AI to suppress their people with Operation Skynet.
[01:01:47.157 --> 01:01:49.338]  I'm not kidding, that's not from Terminator, that's what they call it.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:53.722]  I told you Skynet was a Pentagon plan for this big wireless grid.
[01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:55.103]  Now China's doing it.
[01:01:55.303 --> 01:01:57.004]  Because it's all been given to them.
[01:01:57.224 --> 01:01:58.625]  They're the good boys.
[01:01:59.246 --> 01:02:00.626]  China's the good authoritarians.
[01:02:00.646 --> 01:02:03.008]  They don't have that pesky voting and things.
[01:02:04.369 --> 01:02:08.631]  And so, now we've got the head of Interpol who was a chi-com.
[01:02:08.671 --> 01:02:10.553]  He was the deputy head of their navy.
[01:02:12.034 --> 01:02:12.234]  Top.
[01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:18.178]  Civilian military officer heading up Interpol, which he disappeared last week.
[01:02:18.578 --> 01:02:20.619]  Oh, the Chinese told us five days later they grabbed him.
[01:02:20.939 --> 01:02:35.202]  I guess he wasn't doing everything they said, but the CHICOM officer, he was in control of the code keys to basically everyone's IDs, everyone's social security numbers, everyone's information, just like the personnel management hack.
[01:02:37.323 --> 01:02:38.563]  Interpol's not just the U.S., though.
[01:02:38.623 --> 01:02:39.983]  It's everybody's identity.
[01:02:40.944 --> 01:02:42.124]  Isn't that sweet?
[01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.252]  How China detained the head of Interpol.
[01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:50.933]  Oh my goodness!
[01:02:51.413 --> 01:03:01.460]  We let one of their top civilian military commanders, equivalent of a four-star general, run Interpol the last few years.
[01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:03.342]  What could go wrong?
[01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:16.131]  Just when you check in to a hotel, when you get a rental car, anywhere in the Western world, or many other areas of the planet, it logs into Interpol and tells them everything that's going on under the Patriot Act.
[01:03:17.554 --> 01:03:18.494]  That put us into that.
[01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:21.956]  So you show up to rent a car, and you always wonder why.
[01:03:21.976 --> 01:03:22.496]  Where you going?
[01:03:22.536 --> 01:03:23.017]  What you doing?
[01:03:23.037 --> 01:03:23.557]  What's happening?
[01:03:24.077 --> 01:03:27.259]  I'm like, I'm here with my four children, and I'm really tired.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:29.880]  Oh, really?
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.601]  And I go, listen, I know you're putting it in that security database.
[01:03:32.861 --> 01:03:33.562]  You know where that goes?
[01:03:34.322 --> 01:03:34.902]  You know that, huh?
[01:03:34.922 --> 01:03:36.803]  And I'm like, yeah, lady, I know that.
[01:03:36.823 --> 01:03:38.084]  Then why don't you ask me 20 questions?
[01:03:39.484 --> 01:03:43.987]  But see, oh, let's have this big database that controls everything.
[01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:53.062]  And then let's put the chat comms in control of the AI, of Apple, of Google, of Facebook, of Twitter, everything.
[01:03:53.082 --> 01:03:54.464]  Because, again, it's a base.
[01:03:55.005 --> 01:03:57.929]  Everybody always says, oh my God, corrupt people use Israel as a base against America.
[01:03:58.170 --> 01:04:00.032]  And some corrupt people do jump back and forth and use it.
[01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:00.733]  Absolutely.
[01:04:02.108 --> 01:04:06.010]  But I've noticed a lot about China and how the globalists are using it as a base to launch attacks on America.
[01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:11.692]  Now he went to the, a year and a half ago, after Trump got elected to the Davos, and said, I'll stop Trump.
[01:04:12.113 --> 01:04:15.194]  I'll stop, you know, globalism, you know, we'll defeat America.
[01:04:15.254 --> 01:04:18.115]  And Juncker said, yes, we'll defeat America in a trade war.
[01:04:18.335 --> 01:04:19.356]  And they shook hands on that.
[01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:21.057]  That was a declaration of war against us.
[01:04:21.437 --> 01:04:22.357]  Remember, I covered it at the time.
[01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:23.778]  Pretty big deal.
[01:04:24.138 --> 01:04:25.258]  That's how arrogant these guys are.
[01:04:26.379 --> 01:04:29.600]  And people didn't think that was an issue.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:30.661]  Oh, Alex, come on.
[01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:38.272]  But it's Juncker and Soros and the CHICOM leader and all of them, and they just think they're going to get away with all this because our own elite sold us out to it.
[01:04:38.312 --> 01:04:38.792]  Well guess what?
[01:04:39.072 --> 01:04:40.572]  They didn't have a right to do that!
[01:04:41.473 --> 01:04:47.334]  So Obama and Hillary and Soros and all you that sold us out and Apple, we're evicting your deal with China.
[01:04:47.754 --> 01:04:48.454]  It's a fraud.
[01:04:48.754 --> 01:04:49.475]  It's null and void.
[01:04:49.655 --> 01:04:50.595]  And we're tearing it up.
[01:04:51.335 --> 01:04:54.176]  And a lot of you are in for a big treat.
[01:04:57.802 --> 01:05:00.164]  In fact, I thought about calling the Capitol Switchboard myself.
[01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.065]  Hello!
[01:05:01.566 --> 01:05:04.709]  My name's Alex, but I'm not gonna tell you who I am or where I am.
[01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:08.132]  Brett Kavanaugh gang-raped me with 14 elves.
[01:05:08.492 --> 01:05:10.574]  Yes, it was 49 years ago.
[01:05:10.715 --> 01:05:14.238]  And Brett Kavanaugh, he also flayed my skin and pulled
[01:05:14.318 --> 01:05:15.218]  I can't look at her.
[01:05:15.238 --> 01:05:15.979]  It's like Hillary.
[01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:19.680]  It's just a bug-eyed vampire bat look that these people have.
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.680]  And just knowing how she sits and purrs.
[01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:41.087]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:05:41.167 --> 01:05:44.148]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:26.428 --> 01:06:30.798]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.564 --> 01:06:38.608]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:06:39.068 --> 01:06:47.435]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:06:47.595 --> 01:06:58.944]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:06:59.044 --> 01:07:00.586]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:07:01.366 --> 01:07:17.253]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:07:17.313 --> 01:07:19.574]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:07:20.034 --> 01:07:26.417]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[01:07:29.116 --> 01:07:31.218]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:31.759 --> 01:07:36.964]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:07:39.807 --> 01:07:48.577]  Yeah, my reputation is amazing with the patriots in corporate America, and at the Pentagon, and at the patriots at the CIA, and with the President.
[01:07:49.844 --> 01:07:55.546]  Not the whole CIA, not the whole Pentagon, but the people that know the score and who want to sabotage this country.
[01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:56.606]  Guess what?
[01:07:56.747 --> 01:07:57.527]  I'm the test pilot.
[01:07:58.287 --> 01:08:03.509]  I've been volunteering for this mission, never involved in any agencies, any groups.
[01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:05.029]  I knew the globalist threat.
[01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:06.250]  I read their books.
[01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:07.410]  I saw their reports.
[01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:10.511]  I saw their plan building and everybody else was scared to take them on.
[01:08:12.032 --> 01:08:14.373]  No one was willing to do it in a high-tech, modern manner.
[01:08:16.451 --> 01:08:17.432]  And so, we did it.
[01:08:17.912 --> 01:08:35.627]  And you were willing to take them on, and now, once it's realized that the Clintons and the globalists and the Bushes sold us out to China in a world government plan, and the CFR decades ago said the Chinese century's coming and did everything to sabotage us, once people realize that, it's over!
[01:08:37.288 --> 01:08:38.489]  You ask, how could they do this?
[01:08:40.091 --> 01:08:44.174]  Well, you see, America was conquered by the people when they stood up in 1776.
[01:08:46.337 --> 01:09:00.046]  And then by 1789 and the official establishment of the nation, the ideas of rule by the people and due process and checks and balances threatened all the other imperial corrupt systems in the world.
[01:09:01.807 --> 01:09:13.435]  And that's why the big mega banks and the robber barons fund communism and fund socialism and fund the UN and fund all the radical Islam, because they are at odds with the American system, which is really the Renaissance.
[01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.253]  And the expression of the Magna Carta in 1215.
[01:09:17.574 --> 01:09:18.875]  And the Gutenberg Press.
[01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:21.997]  300 years later.
[01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:26.381]  And where we are today.
[01:09:26.722 --> 01:09:30.265]  This is all the arc of humanity going to the next level.
[01:09:30.465 --> 01:09:31.486]  We're going to hit some bumps.
[01:09:31.526 --> 01:09:32.487]  We're going to go into some valleys.
[01:09:32.527 --> 01:09:35.069]  But the arc overall is up, up, up.
[01:09:35.169 --> 01:09:37.071]  And now, the last 200 years, we are
[01:09:38.388 --> 01:09:38.748]  Leading.
[01:09:38.808 --> 01:09:40.929]  America is leading straight up.
[01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:43.149]  We've already hit escape velocity.
[01:09:43.169 --> 01:09:45.869]  We're already a type 1 civilization, I can tell you.
[01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:50.230]  But the globalists do not want you to know that.
[01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:51.150]  They want to suppress it.
[01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.351]  They want to steal the future.
[01:09:52.371 --> 01:09:55.171]  And when I say this, it's not hyperbole.
[01:09:55.211 --> 01:09:56.591]  You see it all over the news now.
[01:09:58.152 --> 01:10:03.553]  Communist China was chosen by the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others.
[01:10:03.713 --> 01:10:04.853]  Mao was put into power.
[01:10:06.226 --> 01:10:11.090]  Congress passed laws to give billions of dollars of weapons to Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalists.
[01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:14.493]  Imagine China if they were a Nationalist country today and really free market.
[01:10:14.513 --> 01:10:15.974]  They'd be even more powerful than our friend.
[01:10:16.234 --> 01:10:16.755]  Then it'd be great!
[01:10:17.715 --> 01:10:17.876]  No.
[01:10:18.156 --> 01:10:29.265]  The Globalists wanted to manage Communist Party, they could control, and then they would make deals to build them up and transfer our industrial might and then maneuver us into a checkmate position.
[01:10:30.819 --> 01:10:36.263]  And Trump understands this, that they had a $900 million trade deficit on us, and all these other things, and he's saying it's wrong.
[01:10:37.244 --> 01:10:53.196]  And now, he's coming out saying China's meddling in our elections, and he gives real, concrete examples of them buying four-page ads and double-spread ads in hundreds of newspapers in battleground states like Ohio, and Michigan, and Florida, and they've got
[01:10:54.636 --> 01:11:00.339]  Paid infomercials on television putting down Trump and they're financing books and movies.
[01:11:00.739 --> 01:11:04.040]  You want to make a movie about Trump being bad or white people being bad?
[01:11:04.421 --> 01:11:06.622]  It will get financed in 10 seconds.
[01:11:07.682 --> 01:11:08.603]  And guess who does it?
[01:11:08.723 --> 01:11:10.123]  Chinese holding companies.
[01:11:11.384 --> 01:11:15.746]  Why do you think there's hundreds of shows on Netflix about race rioting and whites being bad?
[01:11:16.206 --> 01:11:19.048]  Or hundreds of shows about men being bad?
[01:11:19.568 --> 01:11:21.489]  It's how China divides and conquers!
[01:11:25.216 --> 01:11:37.144]  So the Chinese Communists are allied with the big think tanks, the psychological warfare professors, to give China the intel to understand how to propagandize here in America.
[01:11:37.565 --> 01:11:46.671]  So when you hear Hillary say, Jones gave Russia the American know-how they needed to steal the election, that's her telling you what she did with China.
[01:11:48.392 --> 01:11:52.996]  They're giving it from the perspective of weird, mentally ill, chip on their shoulder,
[01:11:55.618 --> 01:12:08.162]  Harvard and Yale and Stanford and UT psychology department people and Chicago business school people who are just in their own world.
[01:12:08.663 --> 01:12:10.003]  They don't get what's happened in the world.
[01:12:11.203 --> 01:12:12.504]  And they thought Hillary could win.
[01:12:13.424 --> 01:12:15.945]  She looks like a vampire out of a movie mixed with a joker.
[01:12:16.505 --> 01:12:18.586]  It's a joke to them, but the joke's on them.
[01:12:19.806 --> 01:12:24.148]  So her and her pedophile husband and the rest of them just don't know even what universe they're fighting in.
[01:12:25.305 --> 01:12:27.165]  And so they made the deal with China.
[01:12:27.225 --> 01:12:28.145]  They bragged about it.
[01:12:28.185 --> 01:12:29.246]  They thought you were idiots.
[01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:32.646]  And then Trump got in because the American people were hungry for it.
[01:12:33.366 --> 01:12:34.927]  Patriots in the government pushed for it.
[01:12:36.307 --> 01:12:41.168]  Matt Drudge, myself, and many others were willing to be attacked and demonized to get the truth out.
[01:12:41.288 --> 01:12:42.108]  You were willing to do it.
[01:12:42.428 --> 01:12:45.768]  And we are kicking the living snot out of them.
[01:12:47.649 --> 01:12:51.209]  We're kicking the living, holy details out of them.
[01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:54.290]  We are stomping their guts out.
[01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:58.793]  We opened a gigantic can of Yosemite sand on them.
[01:13:00.295 --> 01:13:02.277]  And I hate globalists.
[01:13:02.537 --> 01:13:04.078]  And they don't know what to do.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.922]  InfoWars is where the fuse got lit.
[01:13:08.743 --> 01:13:09.904]  The bomb already blew up.
[01:13:10.224 --> 01:13:16.410]  They're over InfoWars trying to piss on us, thinking that that's how far behind they are.
[01:13:17.651 --> 01:13:18.872]  That's why it's a sick joke.
[01:13:20.394 --> 01:13:20.594]  I mean,
[01:13:22.173 --> 01:13:23.676]  Let me tell the listeners something, okay?
[01:13:23.757 --> 01:13:27.505]  Supporting them for spreading the word, we've already devastated them.
[01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:31.573]  Nationalists are winning all over the world, from Italy to Brazil.
[01:13:36.098 --> 01:13:38.679]  It's going to be tough on those of us that have been on the front line.
[01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:41.040]  We've been singled out for retaliation.
[01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:47.122]  But the tree of liberty gets watered by the blood of patriots and tyrants, jackasses.
[01:13:47.823 --> 01:13:49.083]  And that's what these globalists don't get.
[01:13:49.103 --> 01:13:56.886]  They keep thinking I'm like them and just holding on to life and holding on to power and trying to get on top of people and scheming.
[01:13:57.146 --> 01:13:58.347]  I'm already on top of you!
[01:13:59.227 --> 01:13:59.748]  Spiritually.
[01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.750]  I don't even want power.
[01:14:02.211 --> 01:14:03.713]  You get real power, you don't want power.
[01:14:04.454 --> 01:14:05.415]  You people are falling.
[01:14:05.435 --> 01:14:06.436]  I'm talking to the globalists right now.
[01:14:06.657 --> 01:14:07.197]  You're a joke.
[01:14:08.599 --> 01:14:11.062]  So here's the big giant announcement to everybody.
[01:14:12.945 --> 01:14:13.505]  We're winning.
[01:14:14.447 --> 01:14:15.308]  We're going through hell.
[01:14:15.348 --> 01:14:16.870]  We got even bigger challenges down the road.
[01:14:19.753 --> 01:14:23.036]  But don't let anybody demoralize you because you are kicking butt.
[01:14:23.817 --> 01:14:26.159]  And who cares when mainstream media lies about your attacks?
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:36.990]  These are all the sellouts and all the scum and all the traitors and all the yes-men who are just groveling and trying to get ahead by how low they can lay on their belly like fat little snakes.
[01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:38.351]  We're men.
[01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:39.452]  We walk on our legs.
[01:14:40.653 --> 01:14:41.895]  We don't bow down in ditches.
[01:14:43.322 --> 01:14:44.243]  We build a world.
[01:14:44.263 --> 01:14:44.923]  We're farmers.
[01:14:45.363 --> 01:14:46.044]  We're engineers.
[01:14:46.084 --> 01:14:46.744]  We're scientists.
[01:14:47.304 --> 01:14:47.845]  We're fathers.
[01:14:47.885 --> 01:14:48.345]  We're mothers.
[01:14:48.945 --> 01:14:49.386]  We're brothers.
[01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:49.946]  We're sisters.
[01:14:50.246 --> 01:14:50.746]  We're husbands.
[01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:51.267]  We're wives.
[01:14:51.547 --> 01:14:52.327]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:14:53.988 --> 01:15:00.872]  We're also very, very vicious and very, very destructive and very, very wicked when we need to be.
[01:15:01.713 --> 01:15:03.454]  And the globalists have been finding that out, you see.
[01:15:04.775 --> 01:15:08.237]  All they've got is throngs of mindless zombies that can't even find their butt with both hands.
[01:15:08.557 --> 01:15:10.038]  We have all the tools
[01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:19.153]  If you simply get off the bench and start becoming political and cultural and economic in the fight, and nothing can stop you, you are invincible.
[01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:20.614]  With God's help.
[01:15:23.115 --> 01:15:25.156]  And it's here, and it's now, but I'm going to say it again.
[01:15:25.977 --> 01:15:26.417]  The Big News.
[01:15:27.475 --> 01:15:30.477]  They made a deal to sell us out to China and bring in world government, collapse us.
[01:15:31.037 --> 01:15:33.439]  In the 11th hour, 58th minute, it's begun to reverse.
[01:15:33.859 --> 01:15:37.321]  That's why they're in panic mode, it's why they're so criminal, and why they're so dangerous.
[01:15:37.981 --> 01:15:39.502]  It's because they're willing to do anything.
[01:15:39.842 --> 01:15:44.945]  But now they're exposed, and they don't have control of the executive, and that's why we're going to win.
[01:15:45.886 --> 01:15:52.570]  The problem is, they're gonna stage false flags, and some really nasty stuff soon, and our biggest challenges are about to happen.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:02.864]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:04.224]  Translation?
[01:16:05.005 --> 01:16:09.667]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[01:16:09.847 --> 01:16:18.171]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[01:16:18.191 --> 01:16:24.154]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security.
[01:16:24.414 --> 01:16:28.881]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[01:16:40.077 --> 01:16:46.138]  There's a quite comprehensive internet censorship system set up, and it's known as the Great Firewall.
[01:16:46.198 --> 01:16:53.420]  It blocks all kinds of information about, you know, political opponents of the ruling Communist Party regime there.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:55.480]  All kinds of things that they're blocking out.
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:17:02.202]  Companies agreed to ban particular sites or search times on topics like human rights, democracy, and free speech.
[01:17:02.502 --> 01:17:03.962]  You know Google's really the CIA.
[01:17:05.697 --> 01:17:11.380]  But it's leftist run now, so it's brought over to China and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:19.983]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[01:17:20.123 --> 01:17:26.566]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[01:17:26.987 --> 01:17:27.927]  We'd never know what happened.
[01:17:27.927 --> 01:17:37.475]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:17:37.515 --> 01:17:39.276]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:17:39.356 --> 01:17:50.065]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[01:17:50.225 --> 01:18:02.475]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government, sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government, but we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[01:18:02.655 --> 01:18:03.255]  Not a big deal.
[01:18:03.956 --> 01:18:05.837]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there, but I...
[01:18:08.239 --> 01:18:14.523]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[01:18:15.044 --> 01:18:20.487]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activist.
[01:18:20.527 --> 01:18:25.130]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:29.473]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[01:18:29.873 --> 01:18:35.515]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[01:18:36.115 --> 01:18:37.795]  Give me a break.
[01:18:38.075 --> 01:18:40.496]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[01:18:40.656 --> 01:18:52.079]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[01:18:52.219 --> 01:18:55.000]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.482]  The leaked emails were likely responsible for the deaths of up to 20 CIA agents working in China.
[01:19:01.622 --> 01:19:07.003]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:16.405]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[01:19:16.525 --> 01:19:24.567]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent
[01:19:26.569 --> 01:19:29.511]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone.
[01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:34.656]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[01:19:35.436 --> 01:19:47.186]  But if you're the Chinese government and you want access to every citizen and all their data and everything they've ever done on an Apple product, good to go, baby.
[01:19:48.207 --> 01:19:48.808]  Good to go.
[01:19:49.528 --> 01:19:52.311]  And the left in America loves it.
[01:19:59.231 --> 01:20:01.840]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.856 --> 01:20:28.417]  Welcome back.
[01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:35.765]  Okay, I have so much news I could do 10 hours of broadcast, but I keep harping on China because it's in the news.
[01:20:36.787 --> 01:20:41.913]  But the President, the Pentagon, even Congress, big corporations admit, okay, it's been a one-sided deal with China.
[01:20:41.933 --> 01:20:44.155]  It's been a giant crime against our country.
[01:20:44.175 --> 01:20:48.000]  We've been totally and completely sold out.
[01:20:49.577 --> 01:20:58.841]  And now they're transferring the internet control keys over there so that they can run censorship against the rest of the world out of there with a government that supports total tyranny.
[01:21:00.821 --> 01:21:05.763]  And then they've loaded spy chips into all the Chinese appliances, their phones, you name it.
[01:21:06.003 --> 01:21:07.244]  That's Bloomberg Businessweek.
[01:21:09.125 --> 01:21:15.087]  And now, this is from Yahoo News, Associated Press, Reuters is all picking it up.
[01:21:16.403 --> 01:21:19.245]  Stay away from China, White House top economist tells U.S.
[01:21:19.265 --> 01:21:19.625]  business.
[01:21:20.205 --> 01:21:21.766]  As trade tensions escalate between the U.S.
[01:21:21.806 --> 01:21:23.787]  and China, Washington is sending a warning to U.S.
[01:21:23.807 --> 01:21:24.127]  companies.
[01:21:24.467 --> 01:21:25.788]  Think twice about doing business in China.
[01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:29.890]  If I were in business, I would basically just stay away from China right now.
[01:21:31.211 --> 01:21:32.652]  Their misbehavior is so terrible.
[01:21:34.092 --> 01:21:38.675]  Kevin Hasser, chairman of the Economic Council Advisors, said on Yahoo Finance Market Show Friday.
[01:21:40.076 --> 01:21:42.117]  That's why President Trump is taking a hard line with them.
[01:21:43.032 --> 01:21:47.836]  They've got to change the way they behave if they want to be part of the modern world global economy.
[01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:53.920]  Now instead they just do whatever they want because they're a bunch of mad dog communists that have been in power since 1949.
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:22:05.689]  And the children of all the party officials are all billionaires and are just allied with insane anti-American Silicon Valley and again are
[01:22:06.997 --> 01:22:15.802]  Google, all of them, are helping censor, they're helping round people up, and they're helping create AI weapon control systems, but won't even work with the Pentagon.
[01:22:17.904 --> 01:22:26.169]  I'd respect the company if they said, I'm not going to work with anybody, if that was their... but no, no, no, we're not, we're America haters, we won't work with America.
[01:22:27.389 --> 01:22:31.372]  Hassard also cited the bombshell story from Bloomberg Businessweek, which claims, which claims,
[01:22:32.881 --> 01:22:40.265]  China's military deployed a microchip, they're in all the devices, to attack hardware and supply chain at an infiltrated U.S.
[01:22:40.846 --> 01:22:43.887]  Tech giants like Amazon and Apple, both companies have denied the report.
[01:22:44.368 --> 01:22:46.349]  Oh, and they deny they censor, they deny they're leftists.
[01:22:46.749 --> 01:22:50.792]  But it still raised many concerns about Chinese electronic manufacturers.
[01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:56.035]  Hong Kong listed Lenovo and ZTA saw share prices drop 15%.
[01:23:00.003 --> 01:23:03.144]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Zuckerberg, let's pull him up in China.
[01:23:03.424 --> 01:23:05.185]  He agrees with censorship, so does Tim Cook.
[01:23:05.425 --> 01:23:06.985]  Tim Cook, I did a special report on him last week.
[01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:09.026]  Tim Cook, the most dangerous man in the world.
[01:23:10.446 --> 01:23:25.371]  Because he's the bridge, the Trojan horse, and he says, oh, we need to let China censor, it's called curation, curating, like a museum, and I'll want to do that in America.
[01:23:26.909 --> 01:23:30.990]  So he thinks they demonize me, they lie about me, and they pick me as the straw man, and then they do it.
[01:23:34.591 --> 01:23:36.231]  So, they're all moving back in.
[01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:39.252]  Big Tech made the decision a few years ago under Obama to move back in.
[01:23:39.512 --> 01:23:41.013]  They've done it, and they never left.
[01:23:41.033 --> 01:23:42.973]  It's the truth.
[01:23:43.693 --> 01:23:46.254]  So, the globalists made a deal to sell us out.
[01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:47.795]  We pointed it out.
[01:23:47.975 --> 01:23:48.775]  Others pointed it out.
[01:23:49.095 --> 01:23:49.875]  Trump got in.
[01:23:51.516 --> 01:23:53.096]  The Russia distraction isn't working.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:58.163]  And it's all coming out and the Democrats are scared.
[01:23:58.624 --> 01:24:01.847]  How a Pentagon contract became an identity crisis for Google.
[01:24:02.168 --> 01:24:05.831]  New York Times won't work with the Pentagon.
[01:24:05.931 --> 01:24:06.492]  That's Google.
[01:24:08.915 --> 01:24:09.175]  You see?
[01:24:10.036 --> 01:24:14.701]  And now they're going to meet with the Pentagon and say, oh, we're not discriminating against America.
[01:24:14.761 --> 01:24:16.422]  No, the sky's not blue.
[01:24:16.863 --> 01:24:17.704]  No, no, no.
[01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:21.910]  Unbelievable!
[01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:32.199]  Because China has a billion four hundred million slaves who have high IQs and work hard and they can be used to leverage out the whole planet if they can have unfair trade advantage.
[01:24:33.421 --> 01:24:35.342]  And that's the plan and that's why they did it.
[01:24:35.382 --> 01:24:36.483]  I'm done talking about China.
[01:24:36.503 --> 01:24:38.365]  I've got an hour and 24 minutes on it.
[01:24:38.445 --> 01:24:38.766]  I'm done.
[01:24:39.827 --> 01:24:42.049]  It's just now you see it coming into view.
[01:24:43.413 --> 01:24:44.854]  China is attacking the U.S.
[01:24:44.894 --> 01:24:46.976]  infrastructure and infiltrating it with the help of big tech.
[01:24:47.597 --> 01:24:53.041]  This was a plan under Hillary and Obama to put us into checkmate, to make us capitulate, to capture America.
[01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:53.762]  They're globalists.
[01:24:54.502 --> 01:24:56.024]  China is the globalist stronghold.
[01:24:56.084 --> 01:24:56.944]  They said it Davos.
[01:24:56.984 --> 01:24:57.525]  That's the plan.
[01:25:00.447 --> 01:25:02.729]  Yeah, let's just show images of Zuckerberg with the Chinese president.
[01:25:04.311 --> 01:25:05.652]  So, that's what's going on.
[01:25:06.112 --> 01:25:07.293]  They've got a pliant group.
[01:25:07.333 --> 01:25:10.196]  The left thinks they can leverage into global domination.
[01:25:10.236 --> 01:25:11.417]  Well, not if we're aware of it!
[01:25:12.389 --> 01:25:14.070]  And not if we start cutting China off?
[01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:15.811]  Who wrote the TPP deal?
[01:25:15.971 --> 01:25:16.351]  Hillary?
[01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:18.972]  Who, it turned out, helped write it?
[01:25:19.152 --> 01:25:20.072]  Dianne Feinstein.
[01:25:20.593 --> 01:25:27.356]  And who gave advice in what they wanted if China was going to join TPP, which they never even ended up doing?
[01:25:27.376 --> 01:25:32.678]  Because they just got us to go to the agreement, but then they didn't have to enter it.
[01:25:33.666 --> 01:25:37.008]  And that was the Chinese Chief of Staff she had.
[01:25:37.469 --> 01:25:39.891]  It was her personal aide for over a decade.
[01:25:40.191 --> 01:25:42.432]  A high-level Chinese intelligence operative.
[01:25:42.813 --> 01:25:43.293]  Now confirmed.
[01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:44.414]  Of course!
[01:25:45.134 --> 01:25:46.976]  That's a Chinese seat in the Senate!
[01:25:47.436 --> 01:25:48.597]  They paid for it!
[01:25:50.598 --> 01:25:51.899]  They believe they own us!
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:53.561]  They think we're idiots!
[01:25:54.502 --> 01:26:12.525]  Because when you are brought up like Dianne Feinstein to hate America, and her whole world is hating America, hating Western culture, she's taught to feel inferior, she's taught that she's been put down, and she's an underdog, so if she can metaphysically piss all over America, and run us into the ground with a bunch of soulless, chi-com murderers, she'll be a real girl!
[01:26:12.945 --> 01:26:14.666]  Well guess what, you old hunchback witch?
[01:26:15.186 --> 01:26:17.146]  Get ready, because everybody hates you.
[01:26:20.107 --> 01:26:20.647]  So there you go!
[01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:31.410]  Now, we're going to go to break and come back with the head of Gab that they're trying to take off the internet as well and trying to take their processing away from to get into the censorship wars when he thinks Andrew Torma thinks we should do to fight this.
[01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:33.952]  Then we're going to open the phones up as well after that.
[01:26:34.553 --> 01:26:39.677]  Then I have Conrad Padilla here in studio, Millie Weaver and so much more.
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.480]  We're also going to play this compilation.
[01:26:44.001 --> 01:26:44.801]  Part of the compilation.
[01:26:44.821 --> 01:26:47.281]  I've got a bigger one coming up when Millie Weaver joins us.
[01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:48.562]  I'm going to host the fourth hour today.
[01:26:49.322 --> 01:26:52.043]  When Millie Weaver joins us, incredible footage.
[01:26:52.323 --> 01:26:53.103]  She and her crew.
[01:26:53.543 --> 01:26:55.343]  She's got two crew members now, not just Gavin.
[01:26:55.743 --> 01:26:56.264]  One other fella.
[01:26:56.724 --> 01:26:58.184]  Just the most amazing stuff.
[01:26:58.704 --> 01:27:01.645]  Now, we're on broadcast TV, so we have to blur out all the even...
[01:27:02.865 --> 01:27:05.709]  The shirts that say F this and people flipping the bird.
[01:27:05.729 --> 01:27:09.433]  So you'll see a lot of black cubes and stuff everywhere.
[01:27:09.473 --> 01:27:10.874]  But that's what's happening there.
[01:27:10.894 --> 01:27:13.297]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:27:13.417 --> 01:27:15.560]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.742]  I cannot stress enough how they're trying to shut us down.
[01:27:17.782 --> 01:27:22.888]  I cannot stress enough that because they've taken our payment processor
[01:27:24.909 --> 01:27:33.415]  PayPal, and then we've got some backups, but they are just, like we're a foreign country, the globalists are persecuting us like sanctions, because we're Americans.
[01:27:33.755 --> 01:27:35.256]  Globalism is a sanction on America.
[01:27:35.817 --> 01:27:38.519]  So, I'm seen as Americana, I'm under massive attack, as you know.
[01:27:39.619 --> 01:27:44.783]  Trump now, they say, has lost $2 billion in his businesses since he ran for president and won, with all the persecution.
[01:27:44.983 --> 01:27:45.523]  Well, guess what?
[01:27:45.623 --> 01:27:48.986]  I don't have one-tenth of what he's lost, one-one-hundredth of that.
[01:27:49.967 --> 01:27:51.588]  So, we don't have the money to operate under that.
[01:27:52.455 --> 01:27:57.617]  We've still got shopping carts, you're still able to get orders through, and whatever orders go through will be shipped out.
[01:27:57.657 --> 01:28:04.380]  That's why we're wrapping Christmas and Black Friday and Cyber Monday all into one now, and saying get your products now at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:28:05.882 --> 01:28:08.425]  And go ahead and order the Christmas stuff you're going to need.
[01:28:08.525 --> 01:28:12.769]  You know, some X2, some Coil Silver, Silver Bullet, some Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:28:13.650 --> 01:28:22.278]  Even though X2 is going to sell out, even though Brain Force is going to sell out, it's our last run of that, Super Metal Vitality, we're still going to do 50% off just to get the inventory out the door.
[01:28:22.999 --> 01:28:24.000]  We know our numbers.
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:26.363]  We're sure to sell all this by Christmas, but you know what?
[01:28:27.455 --> 01:28:29.677]  I'm not going to wait till then and then sell it then.
[01:28:29.717 --> 01:28:30.757]  We're going to get it out the door.
[01:28:31.058 --> 01:28:35.541]  Help us now get the money in to make sure we can continue on for a while, no matter what they pull on us.
[01:28:35.961 --> 01:28:37.983]  But don't wait, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:38.043 --> 01:28:39.584]  Take action.
[01:28:39.604 --> 01:28:42.946]  50% off, super sale, and free shipping store-wide.
[01:28:43.006 --> 01:28:46.789]  Free shipping store-wide, 50% off on all the supplements, a bunch of other big specials as well.
[01:28:47.169 --> 01:28:48.550]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:28:48.650 --> 01:28:49.551]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:53.574]  They absolutely hate the fact that you're able to support us and get great products.
[01:28:55.382 --> 01:29:01.124]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:29:01.404 --> 01:29:05.425]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:29:05.885 --> 01:29:08.086]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:29:08.106 --> 01:29:10.227]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:29:10.587 --> 01:29:12.588]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:29:13.108 --> 01:29:13.348]  Boom!
[01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:15.889]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:29:16.229 --> 01:29:17.809]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:29:17.849 --> 01:29:19.670]  You still have InfoWall Store.
[01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:20.850]  You still have a shopfront.
[01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.831]  And then what do we see?
[01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:22.871]  Washington Post.
[01:29:23.431 --> 01:29:26.572]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[01:29:27.932 --> 01:29:31.033]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:29:31.053 --> 01:29:33.894]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:29:34.194 --> 01:29:39.616]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:39.936 --> 01:29:46.918]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros, like Media Matters is, to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[01:29:47.238 --> 01:29:50.659]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships, like CNN is.
[01:29:50.919 --> 01:29:53.080]  We're only funded by you, by getting the product
[01:29:53.161 --> 01:29:53.545]  We're good.
[01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:07.767]  That is Natalijan Subramanian, an auditor for the Government Accountability Office.
[01:30:08.347 --> 01:30:17.734]  The GAO, as it's called, is supposed to be an independent, non-partisan agency that investigates how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars.
[01:30:18.195 --> 01:30:26.421]  Subramanian is also an avowed communist and a committed member of DSA, the Democratic Socialists of America.
[01:30:27.014 --> 01:30:31.537]  We have a bunch of economists, you know, prefects in this country.
[01:30:31.837 --> 01:30:35.540]  We have some folks who are like Trotskyists who are not scientists.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:44.166]  Subromanian admits that he is not alone, that there are many, many DSA socialist operatives working inside our federal government.
[01:30:44.266 --> 01:30:47.428]  These people, these socialists, are not helping our government.
[01:30:47.548 --> 01:30:50.830]  They are actively subverting President Trump's policies.
[01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:53.052]  Like, we're an executive branch agency.
[01:30:53.792 --> 01:30:59.197]  Perfect timing with Trump battling the deep state and rogue government.
[01:31:10.788 --> 01:31:13.471]  Literally saying they're taking their orders from Hillary and Obama.
[01:31:13.491 --> 01:31:15.432]  They call her Madam President still.
[01:31:15.853 --> 01:31:20.017]  Just the arrogance, the attitude, the videos you have of them saying, we're never going to get fired.
[01:31:20.077 --> 01:31:22.038]  We're part of the Socialist and Communist Party.
[01:31:22.078 --> 01:31:23.440]  We're going to take over America.
[01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:28.684]  And so it's the arrogance, it's the chicken neckness, it's the stupidness of them.
[01:31:28.865 --> 01:31:30.166]  But then it makes me feel stupid.
[01:31:30.486 --> 01:31:33.569]  How do we ever let this much scum run our lives, James O'Keefe?
[01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:49.481]  Well, Alex, you know, this is why maybe we need civil service reform, because the Deep State is not just the director of the intelligence agency and Rosenstein and whoever else, it's also millions of foot soldiers, thousands and thousands of these people that we've caught on tape.
[01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:51.903]  This is just a small cross-sampling of them.
[01:31:52.463 --> 01:32:02.251]  And yes, if you look at these tapes, what's remarkable is, I mean, the guy that we released Thursday, this self-described communist inside a government auditor's office,
[01:32:02.831 --> 01:32:22.553]  He says, what I do is explicitly prohibited, I'm hungover, I don't even go to work, I spend my time, this is what he says on the tape, I spend my time electing democratic socialists and I lied on my forms to the federal government, but nothing will ever happen to me because there's no oversight, nobody will care, it's impossible to get fired.
[01:32:23.394 --> 01:32:26.657]  There he is right there, Nate Sumeranian, auditor at GAO.
[01:32:27.077 --> 01:32:30.540]  So it's just, these are what they call the Democratic Socialists of America.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:32.202]  A lot of them are federal employees.
[01:32:32.222 --> 01:32:33.863]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[01:32:34.264 --> 01:32:35.325]  This is videotape.
[01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:41.791]  And by the way, the man you're looking at right there, that man right there, he has been shown the door at GAO.
[01:32:42.171 --> 01:32:47.054]  While they may not be able to, quote, fire him, they have removed him from the building.
[01:32:47.074 --> 01:32:48.795]  This is like a Greek tragedy.
[01:32:48.835 --> 01:32:53.317]  They can't fire the people, so they just have to, like, take them away from their computer systems.
[01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:01.902]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:11.135 --> 01:33:17.422]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.465 --> 01:33:22.808]  By the way, Tucker Carlson defended us twice last week.
[01:33:22.828 --> 01:33:23.669]  I never even got this clip.
[01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:29.435]  I want to play this ahead of our guest finding us because, slowly but surely, free speech is being very quickly strangled.
[01:33:30.731 --> 01:33:48.334]  And now they're going after your ability to even be in the free market, and the Democrats are using people inside the Justice Department, inside the CIA, to dox folks, as you're now seeing, criminal charges, with intel that only insiders could have, to actually shut down our ability to even have our own platforms.
[01:33:49.908 --> 01:33:55.693]  The head of Gab, which is a true free speech social network, is facing oblivion right now.
[01:33:56.273 --> 01:34:02.759]  Many authors that were best sellers on Amazon have had their payment processors taken and Amazon taken, so they're just going dark.
[01:34:03.199 --> 01:34:04.500]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:06.902]  We need the President and Congress to act first.
[01:34:08.049 --> 01:34:09.090]  He had to turn the economy on.
[01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:14.852]  He had to point out that the Chi-Coms are the real enemy that the globalists are using as an attack base against us.
[01:34:15.773 --> 01:34:19.195]  And he had to get the Supreme Court in place to move forward.
[01:34:19.235 --> 01:34:20.055]  But guess what?
[01:34:20.815 --> 01:34:24.017]  Trump is about to go on the attack after the midterms.
[01:34:24.777 --> 01:34:30.140]  So all the globalists and AI pushers at Google and all the rest of the censors, get ready.
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:32.061]  Here is Tucker Carlson.
[01:34:32.833 --> 01:34:40.515]  Previous on this show, we've told you how employees at Google discussed altering search results to undermine the White House's immigration policies.
[01:34:40.555 --> 01:34:44.936]  At the time, Google said it has never changed search results for political reasons, and it never will.
[01:34:45.396 --> 01:34:47.957]  We knew it was untrue then, now we can prove that it is untrue.
[01:34:48.337 --> 01:34:57.359]  The show has obtained internal Google emails in which an employee discusses editing YouTube search results to suppress videos based on their political content.
[01:34:57.919 --> 01:34:58.559]  Here's one example.
[01:34:58.599 --> 01:35:09.384]  Last March, Google engineer Dong Zhao sent an email saying the company wanted to, and we're quoting, "...demote low authoritative content on controversial queries to fight against fake news."
[01:35:10.144 --> 01:35:11.264]  This was not hypothetical.
[01:35:11.604 --> 01:35:20.208]  He said the company had already succeeded in suppressing unwanted videos, videos for searches like Hillary and, we're flattered here, Tucker.
[01:35:20.948 --> 01:35:29.519]  It's not clear which videos were suppressed because Google won't admit it or tell us, but the email does indicate that Alex Jones and InfoWars were a major target of this.
[01:35:29.919 --> 01:35:38.370]  Google says their efforts are not political and meant to fight conspiracy theories, though for the record we have never endorsed any kind of conspiracy theory.
[01:35:38.410 --> 01:35:39.191]  Yeah, that's about to happen.
[01:36:03.703 --> 01:36:06.405]  Conspiracy theory means questioning the official story.
[01:36:06.786 --> 01:36:09.729]  They mixed in with Bigfoot space aliens, but that's not the stuff that hurts them.
[01:36:10.529 --> 01:36:14.573]  They have censored me saying Jones claims Big Tech censoring conservatives.
[01:36:14.853 --> 01:36:16.314]  We have Project Veritas videos.
[01:36:16.575 --> 01:36:20.458]  We have internal documents, hundreds of them, where they say our main enemy is Alex Jones.
[01:36:21.419 --> 01:36:22.980]  Our next enemy is Paul Watson.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:24.960]  Our next enemy is Donald Trump.
[01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:26.741]  And yes, Tucker Carlson.
[01:36:27.121 --> 01:36:28.521]  His videos would all get 20 million views.
[01:36:28.801 --> 01:36:32.122]  You can't have his show, you know, on YouTube have 20 million views.
[01:36:32.502 --> 01:36:38.343]  Before they put shadowbanning on him about a year and a half ago, I noticed every Tucker Carlson video had like 5 million views.
[01:36:38.703 --> 01:36:39.643]  Now they're a half million.
[01:36:40.224 --> 01:36:42.264]  Because they shadowban the things.
[01:36:43.304 --> 01:36:43.664]  Okay?
[01:36:44.304 --> 01:36:44.764]  It's simple.
[01:36:44.784 --> 01:36:45.405]  They admit it.
[01:36:45.505 --> 01:36:47.425]  I have their executives on hidden camera.
[01:36:47.705 --> 01:36:51.166]  I'm gonna spare you and go to our guest, Andrew Torba of Gab.com.
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.021]  You know, Andrew obviously launched a successful site.
[01:36:56.041 --> 01:36:56.942]  Millions of people use it.
[01:36:57.822 --> 01:36:59.743]  And they've... Google's delisted it.
[01:37:00.083 --> 01:37:01.624]  They've gone up his payment processing.
[01:37:01.644 --> 01:37:03.064]  They're trying to shut him down right now.
[01:37:03.084 --> 01:37:04.725]  So they say, oh, go do your own thing.
[01:37:04.925 --> 01:37:05.465]  Oh, yeah.
[01:37:05.786 --> 01:37:07.506]  That's when they really come after you.
[01:37:08.367 --> 01:37:09.747]  So it's good to have you here.
[01:37:09.767 --> 01:37:17.671]  I wanted to get your view on where we are right now in this purge, 29 days out from the election, because it's hurting those of us that run these operations, but
[01:37:18.611 --> 01:37:24.774]  I think the intimidation and the censoring is actually waking a lot of people up, but will it be too little too late?
[01:37:25.235 --> 01:37:26.795]  Where would you say we are right now in this fight?
[01:37:28.216 --> 01:37:30.057]  Well, Alex, I think a lot of people are waking up.
[01:37:30.577 --> 01:37:47.025]  Today, actually just within the past half hour, we had a breaking news report that Google Plus, Google's social network, exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users to developers, just like Facebook had millions of users' data exposed to developers for years.
[01:37:47.066 --> 01:37:47.786]  This is going on.
[01:37:48.186 --> 01:37:52.508]  And finally, people are starting to wake up and say, wait a minute, why do we have all of our data?
[01:37:52.788 --> 01:37:59.170]  Why do we share all of our most intimate private moments, all of our most intimate private conversations with these two or three companies?
[01:37:59.531 --> 01:38:05.173]  And that's really why we started Gab is I was out in Silicon Valley and I said, why is there no real alternative?
[01:38:05.213 --> 01:38:07.854]  Like we have this illusion of choice for all of these companies.
[01:38:08.254 --> 01:38:08.674]  I think so.
[01:38:27.342 --> 01:38:34.025]  Like you said, they told us to go and build our own, which is exactly what we did, and now we're being attacked at every single level.
[01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:35.765]  We're being banned from app stores.
[01:38:35.865 --> 01:38:39.907]  We have payment processors no-platforming us and saying we can't use them anymore.
[01:38:39.927 --> 01:38:42.348]  We have our hosting provider telling us to censor things.
[01:38:42.648 --> 01:38:48.110]  We even have our domain registrar threatening to seize our domain because they don't like the content on our site.
[01:38:48.630 --> 01:38:49.870]  Now, this is ridiculous.
[01:38:50.331 --> 01:38:51.511]  This is not a free market.
[01:38:51.551 --> 01:38:52.651]  This is a rigged market.
[01:38:52.731 --> 01:39:01.594]  And let's be clear, because Congress and the President haven't acted yet, because it takes time, everything they've done to me and you is being green-lighted against everybody else, from James Woods to Ann Coulter.
[01:39:01.854 --> 01:39:03.874]  They're moving against everyone right now.
[01:39:04.215 --> 01:39:06.515]  This is serious authoritarianism.
[01:39:06.575 --> 01:39:07.395]  It's cartel.
[01:39:07.636 --> 01:39:11.297]  When you get all these companies together, notice Tim Cook came out and said, oh, we didn't get together.
[01:39:11.357 --> 01:39:12.157]  He admitted it earlier.
[01:39:12.597 --> 01:39:15.818]  That's the real crime, is that they're getting together and targeting groups.
[01:39:16.989 --> 01:39:19.691]  Right, and Tim Cook talks about curating content.
[01:39:19.731 --> 01:39:21.852]  Well, curation is just another word for censorship.
[01:39:21.912 --> 01:39:29.296]  It's him, it's Apple, it's Google, it's Facebook, picking and choosing what news sources are quote-unquote real and what are fake news.
[01:39:29.316 --> 01:39:31.638]  Oh my God, Alex Jones had two million downloads in a month of his app.
[01:39:31.718 --> 01:39:34.279]  It's number one with five stars, 20,000 reviews.
[01:39:34.799 --> 01:39:37.401]  Oh, I'm gonna curate this turd in the punch bowl.
[01:39:37.661 --> 01:39:38.381]  No one wants it.
[01:39:38.602 --> 01:39:43.424]  It'd be one thing if it was some scam app that didn't work and had, you know, half a star.
[01:39:43.464 --> 01:39:45.606]  But no, five perfect stars
[01:39:46.366 --> 01:39:48.350]  I was censored for winning the Indy 500.
[01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:50.574]  I was censored for winning the Super Bowl.
[01:39:50.814 --> 01:39:54.662]  I was censored because we're number one, even with their damn censorship.
[01:39:54.862 --> 01:39:58.489]  And they can't compete with our ideas, so they're a bunch of authoritarian scum.
[01:39:59.776 --> 01:40:00.297]  Absolutely.
[01:40:00.437 --> 01:40:06.383]  And you know, we just raised $630,000 in our latest funding round directly from the people.
[01:40:06.764 --> 01:40:08.966]  And they see us doing things like this.
[01:40:09.026 --> 01:40:09.987]  They see us winning.
[01:40:10.028 --> 01:40:13.491]  They see the InfoWars app being downloaded like crazy with five-star reviews.
[01:40:13.531 --> 01:40:21.180]  They see Gab raising hundreds of thousands of dollars from the people, not from Silicon Valley venture capitalists or from Saudi princes like Twitter did.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.040]  And I totally agree.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.040]  And for folks that don't know,
[01:40:46.468 --> 01:40:48.151]  It's the best of worlds, worst of worlds.
[01:40:48.352 --> 01:40:49.354]  Best of times, worst of times.
[01:40:49.915 --> 01:40:54.765]  Okay, we got censored on all these platforms, that cut a lot of traffic, but the fact that there's the Streisand effect...
[01:40:55.743 --> 01:40:58.204]  Video-wise, four or five times the views on our own platform.
[01:40:58.244 --> 01:41:06.009]  The problem is, instead of a $50,000 bill, it went up $100,000 to $150,000, if you count the different bills just for video.
[01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:11.212]  And then we've even got those companies saying, we may kick you off and not let you buy the video from us.
[01:41:11.612 --> 01:41:13.953]  And so we then had to leave one company.
[01:41:14.233 --> 01:41:19.776]  I mean, this is literally total whack-a-mole, and all we're doing is sitting here defending free speech.
[01:41:19.816 --> 01:41:21.877]  So, sounds like a lot of money, $600,000-something.
[01:41:23.506 --> 01:41:25.488]  The software, the bandwidth, all of it.
[01:41:25.508 --> 01:41:26.409]  You need millions.
[01:41:26.769 --> 01:41:27.370]  So do we.
[01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:29.111]  I mean, folks, this is a war.
[01:41:29.452 --> 01:41:31.554]  Google has hundreds of billions.
[01:41:31.714 --> 01:41:32.675]  Apple has a trillion.
[01:41:32.955 --> 01:41:38.160]  But literally a million against each of their billion trumps them like David versus Goliath.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.422]  But we still got to have that support, folks.
[01:41:41.855 --> 01:41:42.596]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:41:42.636 --> 01:41:55.370]  And I think, you know, it's important to keep in mind that, you know, we are playing whack-a-mole, so it prevents us from building out and improving the platform because we have to constantly change providers and find a provider that will support what we're doing and support our mission.
[01:41:55.690 --> 01:41:57.332]  And inevitably, we have to build our own.
[01:41:57.652 --> 01:42:00.415]  We have to start from scratch and build out our own infrastructure.
[01:42:00.455 --> 01:42:01.617]  What about the fact that it's libertarians?
[01:42:02.297 --> 01:42:03.878]  Or just common sense people.
[01:42:04.379 --> 01:42:06.200]  We never target them with boycotts and stuff.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:12.365]  I mean, these damn domain companies and these bandwidth people, all of them, they lie about who you are.
[01:42:12.405 --> 01:42:13.325]  You've been there for years.
[01:42:13.345 --> 01:42:14.226]  You have all this money.
[01:42:14.506 --> 01:42:16.688]  They treat you like crap and kick you off or threaten to.
[01:42:17.048 --> 01:42:19.470]  It's literally like we're Jews in Nazi Germany.
[01:42:20.939 --> 01:42:22.640]  You know, I think we need to start to do the boycott.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:28.145]  I think we need to start to maybe pick up the tactics of the left and start to boycott some of these companies and call them out.
[01:42:28.225 --> 01:42:30.406]  And again, we have to build our own infrastructure.
[01:42:30.446 --> 01:42:31.387]  We have to keep fighting.
[01:42:31.427 --> 01:42:32.428]  We have to keep building.
[01:42:32.868 --> 01:42:35.090]  Otherwise, we're going to have no voice left on the internet.
[01:42:36.584 --> 01:42:37.485]  You're right, my friend.
[01:42:37.545 --> 01:42:41.748]  We'll be right back with Andrew Korba of Gab.com and Gab.ai.
[01:42:41.828 --> 01:42:44.710]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:42:45.150 --> 01:42:46.811]  We are here literally because of you.
[01:42:46.911 --> 01:42:47.872]  We are in your hands.
[01:42:48.292 --> 01:42:54.496]  And when you share our links and our videos and our articles, you put it in the face of the globalists and deliver victory to humanity.
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:00.521]  Let's go to MAGA Titan.
[01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:02.143]  Sorry, I cut you short here, MAGA Titan.
[01:43:02.163 --> 01:43:03.104]  You got 60 seconds.
[01:43:03.144 --> 01:43:03.464]  Go ahead.
[01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:06.327]  There's a war for your mind, and I just can't take it.
[01:43:06.387 --> 01:43:09.069]  Yelling at my phone, trying to break through this matrix.
[01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:11.972]  Thinking how to break through, cause we're all sedated.
[01:43:12.232 --> 01:43:13.514]  America's under attack.
[01:43:13.794 --> 01:43:14.555]  Can we debate it?
[01:43:15.175 --> 01:43:17.436]  They're trying to censor humanity's great awakening.
[01:43:17.636 --> 01:43:20.256]  The calm before the storm, we concede to the population.
[01:43:20.476 --> 01:43:22.417]  The mind control and the manipulation.
[01:43:22.557 --> 01:43:26.798]  They're lying to the TV of your favorite station just so they can get paid off the death of a nation.
[01:43:26.838 --> 01:43:29.418]  But this is the rebirth and you heard it from Jones first.
[01:43:29.698 --> 01:43:32.059]  Feeling like Indiana Jones with a cold curse.
[01:43:32.739 --> 01:43:35.700]  Revolution with no course, instead freedom in America's force.
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.360]  Trying to free humanity from this devilish force.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:40.821]  Fake lips walking dead like a devilish course.
[01:43:41.282 --> 01:43:42.524]  They ask, have I seen the enemy?
[01:43:42.544 --> 01:43:43.666]  I say, yes, of course.
[01:43:43.707 --> 01:43:45.751]  So take this red pill and get informed.
[01:43:46.152 --> 01:43:48.256]  And now I welcome you to the InfoWars.
[01:43:48.296 --> 01:43:49.418]  That's MAGA Titan.
[01:43:49.518 --> 01:43:51.903]  I tell ya, if anyone deserves a bullhorn...
[01:43:57.418 --> 01:43:59.419]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[01:43:59.499 --> 01:44:04.241]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[01:44:04.402 --> 01:44:08.023]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[01:44:08.043 --> 01:44:10.525]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[01:44:10.765 --> 01:44:15.207]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping
[01:44:15.247 --> 01:44:16.108]  We're good to go.
[01:44:30.305 --> 01:44:31.566]  You are confident.
[01:45:02.768 --> 01:45:03.728]  You are unique.
[01:45:07.329 --> 01:45:08.970]  You are inspiring.
[01:45:11.811 --> 01:45:14.451]  And today, you will look your beautiful best.
[01:45:17.012 --> 01:45:24.134]  Instantly Ageless, an age-defying microcream that in less than two minutes restores the youthful appearance of your skin.
[01:45:25.715 --> 01:45:31.420]  Created to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, pores, and puffiness under the eyes.
[01:45:32.741 --> 01:45:33.281]  No needles.
[01:45:33.942 --> 01:45:34.482]  No pain.
[01:45:35.283 --> 01:45:37.564]  Just a happier, younger-looking you.
[01:45:38.725 --> 01:45:40.847]  To use, simply massage the packet.
[01:45:41.728 --> 01:45:45.211]  Dispense a small drop and lightly pat a thin layer to targeted areas.
[01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:50.542]  Leave the product damp on your skin and remain expressionless for two minutes while it dries.
[01:45:51.342 --> 01:45:53.782]  And if you missed a spot, it's easy to reapply.
[01:45:54.322 --> 01:45:58.683]  Or if you happen to apply too much, wet a cotton swab and gently remove any residue.
[01:45:59.363 --> 01:46:02.444]  Apply oil-free cosmetics and finish getting ready as usual.
[01:46:02.904 --> 01:46:03.744]  It's that simple.
[01:46:04.204 --> 01:46:13.206]  I've probably noticed in the past five years that my eyes have gained a lot of fine lines, wrinkles, my curls have gotten deeper.
[01:46:16.784 --> 01:46:17.064]  Wow.
[01:46:17.244 --> 01:46:21.245]  I was hoping for five years, but that's like what my eyes looked like ten years ago.
[01:46:21.325 --> 01:46:22.966]  That is really cool!
[01:46:23.866 --> 01:46:24.226]  Wrinkle?
[01:46:24.866 --> 01:46:25.166]  Gone?
[01:46:26.627 --> 01:46:27.047]  It's easy.
[01:46:27.107 --> 01:46:28.807]  Just put it on your finger and go.
[01:46:28.987 --> 01:46:31.348]  I wish I had more down here because I can still see one wrinkle.
[01:46:31.368 --> 01:46:31.948]  It's bugging me.
[01:46:32.948 --> 01:46:34.189]  I am a little bit emotional.
[01:46:34.769 --> 01:46:45.532]  Turning 40, I didn't think would be a big deal to me, but that looks like the me that I feel like inside instead of what I see when I look in the mirror.
[01:46:58.783 --> 01:47:13.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.201 --> 01:47:23.386]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.169 --> 01:47:30.430]  Andrew Barber is our guest this segment and the next segment.
[01:47:31.071 --> 01:47:33.132]  Then I'm going to open the phones up and take the calls for a while.
[01:47:33.172 --> 01:47:34.392]  Then we have a special guest in studio.
[01:47:34.412 --> 01:47:35.193]  But just listen to me.
[01:47:36.293 --> 01:47:37.634]  I've been on air 23 years.
[01:47:38.814 --> 01:47:40.515]  And you guys, the audience, has been awesome.
[01:47:40.535 --> 01:47:41.756]  And we've changed the world together.
[01:47:42.116 --> 01:47:42.896]  And I love you all.
[01:47:42.957 --> 01:47:44.657]  And so I'm not bitching and complaining at you.
[01:47:45.478 --> 01:47:49.260]  And I tend, when stuff's really serious, to joke around and have fun.
[01:47:50.740 --> 01:47:52.101]  Because that's just how my brain works.
[01:47:53.182 --> 01:47:53.322]  But...
[01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:56.681]  Here's the problem.
[01:47:57.001 --> 01:47:58.061]  I'm not a propagandist.
[01:47:58.902 --> 01:48:04.764]  I promote what I promote because I believe in it passionately, but I don't engage in trying to doll it up or even think about what I'm going to say.
[01:48:06.264 --> 01:48:11.146]  But then, at the same time, I talk to a lot of smart folks and they're like, man, you do not want to encourage the enemy.
[01:48:11.686 --> 01:48:14.888]  The enemy's tapping my phone and knows every damn thing about me.
[01:48:15.708 --> 01:48:18.309]  And I'm not at liberty to get into all this, and I'm not complaining.
[01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:21.627]  But let me tell you folks, you've seen spy movies and stuff?
[01:48:22.167 --> 01:48:22.927]  It's way beyond that.
[01:48:23.007 --> 01:48:24.768]  These people are sick.
[01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:34.451]  And they've got Justice Department level stuff on us.
[01:48:35.152 --> 01:48:35.892]  Nothing corrupt.
[01:48:36.332 --> 01:48:38.533]  They're using the databases like you see in the news.
[01:48:39.173 --> 01:48:43.895]  That the Justice Department and Congress and all these communists and globalists they've hired out of the colleges.
[01:48:45.046 --> 01:48:49.988]  Who literally don't want to work with the Pentagon in AI, but want to work with China suppressing their people.
[01:48:50.568 --> 01:48:53.209]  And so I am literally under attack by a bunch of Maoists.
[01:48:54.910 --> 01:48:58.871]  And I can't even talk about business stuff on the telephone now.
[01:49:00.112 --> 01:49:05.634]  I have to meet with people, and because we've even done disinfo before on the phone, and then they act on it.
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:11.723]  And off record, I've even been to the FBI twice and said, knock it off, okay?
[01:49:12.223 --> 01:49:23.851]  Because we even did some counter stuff, and have watched and done some things, and it's like, my God, man, they have hired like 30 years of FBI agents and people that are whacked out leftists, man.
[01:49:24.251 --> 01:49:26.513]  I'm not saying they're all bad, but let me tell you something.
[01:49:26.713 --> 01:49:28.635]  They have built a secret police army in this country.
[01:49:29.215 --> 01:49:32.097]  And they are at war with Infowars and the President.
[01:49:32.778 --> 01:49:36.541]  And all I can tell you is, thank God for President Trump because we've come a long way.
[01:49:36.561 --> 01:49:37.782]  I'm going to go back to Andrew.
[01:49:38.503 --> 01:49:40.324]  It's just this.
[01:49:44.848 --> 01:49:51.633]  If I've called for your help before and said things are serious, this is urgent and it's 10 times the threat we've ever faced.
[01:49:52.234 --> 01:49:53.415]  You can see it all over the news.
[01:49:53.555 --> 01:49:54.255]  They're in Politico.
[01:49:54.816 --> 01:49:55.797]  I've got the quotes right here.
[01:49:57.193 --> 01:50:00.574]  After failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[01:50:01.334 --> 01:50:02.834]  See, they're just going to double down.
[01:50:04.275 --> 01:50:06.055]  And they're going to stage a false flag and blame it on me.
[01:50:06.115 --> 01:50:07.155]  I'm totally sure of it.
[01:50:07.576 --> 01:50:08.696]  I'm totally sure of it now.
[01:50:09.356 --> 01:50:11.536]  I mean, they've got big stuff coming, so we think we're winning?
[01:50:11.576 --> 01:50:11.937]  Get ready.
[01:50:13.337 --> 01:50:15.998]  We're going to make it through this storm, because people are aware of their scams now.
[01:50:16.038 --> 01:50:17.278]  Kavanaugh was a big example of that.
[01:50:17.318 --> 01:50:25.740]  But we need your financial support to not just expand, but to hold the line and let the enemy know that you're standing with us.
[01:50:26.803 --> 01:50:29.225]  Because what happens if they get all our payment processors, which they're trying to do?
[01:50:30.226 --> 01:50:31.226]  Then you won't be able to buy the product.
[01:50:31.627 --> 01:50:33.208]  We have sponsors for the radio network.
[01:50:33.388 --> 01:50:34.489]  I don't, that doesn't fund us.
[01:50:35.069 --> 01:50:38.311]  They've taken all our, I can't even advertise online on big platforms.
[01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:39.212]  They've taken that from us.
[01:50:39.893 --> 01:50:43.075]  And then I sure as hell can't, they do this sell stuff to make money to fund us.
[01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:44.516]  I'm a free market guy.
[01:50:47.018 --> 01:50:52.042]  So, you know, George Washington robbed British ships to fund his revolution.
[01:50:53.403 --> 01:50:55.044]  So I'm just selling products to fund ours.
[01:50:56.295 --> 01:51:00.057]  And you know, maybe they'll shut down our capability to do that, and people have to do other stuff.
[01:51:00.378 --> 01:51:03.399]  I'm not saying we're going to rob any banks here, but we're not the Weather Underground.
[01:51:03.419 --> 01:51:05.100]  We're just trying to be Americans and promote things.
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:07.782]  So, we've got the biggest sales.
[01:51:07.842 --> 01:51:12.545]  In case they shut us down financially before Christmas or Black Friday or whatever they're trying to do.
[01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:14.786]  I mean, you see them on the news saying they want us destroyed.
[01:51:15.627 --> 01:51:16.928]  You can get your orders in right now.
[01:51:16.948 --> 01:51:21.630]  50% off InfoWars Super Sale and free shipping on all the great supplements.
[01:51:21.650 --> 01:51:23.692]  BrainForce X2, even though they're all about to sell out.
[01:51:23.952 --> 01:51:25.052]  This is the last run of X2.
[01:51:26.886 --> 01:51:29.047]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, everything.
[01:51:29.487 --> 01:51:33.970]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:51:35.150 --> 01:51:37.392]  Everything is 50% off of the supplements.
[01:51:37.952 --> 01:51:41.214]  A lot of other products are already so discounted, there's not even 50% discount.
[01:51:41.454 --> 01:51:42.294]  Maybe 25, 30% you could.
[01:51:42.314 --> 01:51:45.556]  So there's a bunch of other big specials, free shipping, store wide on everything.
[01:51:45.896 --> 01:51:49.578]  So on top of 50%, the free shipping on those is a, some of these are lost liters.
[01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:56.742]  We've got to move the inventory off the shelves in case the enemy shuts us down financially for a while, which is the move they're making.
[01:51:57.682 --> 01:51:59.804]  So again, FloodInfoWarStore.com today.
[01:52:00.464 --> 01:52:01.545]  Now is the time, folks.
[01:52:01.585 --> 01:52:03.166]  Now we need provision for this war.
[01:52:03.186 --> 01:52:04.387]  We need to be strong.
[01:52:04.487 --> 01:52:09.491]  I want to expand live broadcast right through every night, through the election, and then on after.
[01:52:09.971 --> 01:52:10.972]  We're getting the people in place.
[01:52:10.992 --> 01:52:12.032]  We're getting the crews in place.
[01:52:12.393 --> 01:52:13.313]  It's very expensive.
[01:52:13.373 --> 01:52:16.796]  Our bandwidth bills have tripled because everybody came to InfoWars.
[01:52:16.836 --> 01:52:17.777]  Everybody came to Prison Planet.
[01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:18.557]  Everybody came to NewsWars.
[01:52:18.857 --> 01:52:21.459]  Yes, we're actually bigger than we were.
[01:52:21.539 --> 01:52:22.440]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:24.241]  We were already under shadow banning.
[01:52:25.302 --> 01:52:29.887]  Throw me in the briar patch, but there's the other problems of the expenses skyrocketing.
[01:52:29.927 --> 01:52:32.009]  So, thank you for being financially supportive.
[01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:33.551]  Get great products at the same time.
[01:52:33.571 --> 01:52:34.632]  Go to InfoWareStore.com.
[01:52:34.852 --> 01:52:37.294]  There's a donate button as well right there in the support us.
[01:52:37.314 --> 01:52:38.796]  I want to give a pure donation.
[01:52:38.836 --> 01:52:40.798]  That really helps because there's not much profit in these products.
[01:52:41.098 --> 01:52:44.302]  When we do big sales though, we sell a ton of them, so it kind of evens out.
[01:52:44.402 --> 01:52:46.224]  Plus, I got to move it off the inventory shelves.
[01:52:47.045 --> 01:52:50.910]  So I'm not here dead in the water with a ton of Christmas inventory, and they've shut us down, which is their plan.
[01:52:51.330 --> 01:52:53.232]  So I need you to come to Paul Revere's rescue.
[01:52:53.312 --> 01:52:55.075]  You're Paul Revere as well, financially.
[01:52:55.815 --> 01:52:59.199]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:59.219 --> 01:53:01.522]  Now, going back to Andrew Torba.
[01:53:07.938 --> 01:53:13.861]  Explain to me your view on where this is going and what Congress, what the President needs to do because this is incredibly authoritarian.
[01:53:13.881 --> 01:53:16.722]  It's the Chinese model of cutting people off financially.
[01:53:16.742 --> 01:53:21.945]  And talk about what they're trying to do to your payment processors because, I mean, like you said, this is just incredible.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:23.760]  Sure, Alex.
[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:26.923]  Well, I think what you just said is so crucial and so important.
[01:53:27.443 --> 01:53:31.226]  The people are really funding us just as they're funding InfoWars.
[01:53:31.686 --> 01:53:33.628]  And that's what makes these people so mad.
[01:53:33.668 --> 01:53:38.851]  And that's why they're trying to cut off our payment processors and your payment processors and your hosting providers.
[01:53:38.891 --> 01:53:45.056]  And I think a lot of folks don't realize how much it costs to run a website, how much it costs to run a social network.
[01:53:45.396 --> 01:53:49.079]  The bandwidth required to live stream your videos to host your videos.
[01:53:49.399 --> 01:53:52.601]  The bandwidth required to host our content on our site.
[01:53:52.842 --> 01:53:53.802]  People don't realize this.
[01:53:53.882 --> 01:53:57.325]  It costs money and we don't have the luxury like big social networks.
[01:53:57.585 --> 01:54:02.308]  We're not mass collecting your data like Facebook and selling it to advertisers for billions of dollars.
[01:54:02.629 --> 01:54:05.191]  We're completely powered by the people just like InfoWars is.
[01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:05.611]  And I think
[01:54:05.991 --> 01:54:14.935]  What Congress needs to do, what President Trump needs to do is take anti-trust action against these companies because they're doing anti-competitive behavior in the marketplace.
[01:54:14.995 --> 01:54:16.695]  The free market is not free.
[01:54:17.036 --> 01:54:23.178]  It is rigged by an oligarchy in Silicon Valley that decides who can participate in the free market and who cannot.
[01:54:23.518 --> 01:54:35.223]  And I think it's so crucial that the people understand that they really are powering this revolution and this information war and, you know, alternative platforms like us and alternative sources of news like InfoWars
[01:54:35.723 --> 01:54:40.305]  And again, I don't like Nazis, but first they take Stormfront, or whatever it's called, away, and then the next it's...
[01:54:54.517 --> 01:54:56.299]  They're trying to take Donald Trump's banking away.
[01:54:56.319 --> 01:54:57.880]  They're trying to take the NRA's banking away.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:59.201]  They're trying to take ours away.
[01:54:59.241 --> 01:55:00.142]  I mean, they've done it.
[01:55:00.483 --> 01:55:04.706]  And we have to, like, run around like chickens with our heads cut off, you know, just deal with this all weekend.
[01:55:05.167 --> 01:55:06.368]  And it's just never-ending.
[01:55:06.488 --> 01:55:07.609]  And it's so criminal.
[01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:10.552]  If we were doing this to them, they would completely go insane.
[01:55:10.572 --> 01:55:11.212]  Let me ask you this.
[01:55:11.713 --> 01:55:17.999]  The alliance between Big Tech, you were, you know, a mid-level out in Silicon Valley who worked with some of the high-level guys, and they were a successful programmer.
[01:55:19.406 --> 01:55:31.892]  The merger with China, the way they'll work with China but not the Pentagon, the way Google and Twitter and Facebook are helping, and Apple especially, suppress the Chinese people, this authoritarianism and how they've gotten away with so much.
[01:55:31.932 --> 01:55:35.994]  I think that's why they're so arrogant is no one's ever said no to big tech.
[01:55:36.034 --> 01:55:36.975]  They're just out of control.
[01:55:38.445 --> 01:55:38.925]  Absolutely.
[01:55:38.985 --> 01:55:42.167]  It's absolutely insane that they refuse to work as U.S.
[01:55:43.068 --> 01:55:43.708]  corporations.
[01:55:43.748 --> 01:55:53.074]  They refuse to work with our own government, our own military, and they choose to instead work with the Communist Chinese and help them censor their version of the Internet.
[01:55:53.194 --> 01:55:54.555]  It's absolute madness.
[01:55:54.955 --> 01:55:59.236]  This is something you would never think of from an American corporation, and yet here we are.
[01:55:59.576 --> 01:56:06.017]  This new portal technology, this hardware device that Facebook just put out today, they want to be in your living room.
[01:56:06.037 --> 01:56:08.898]  This camera actually tracks you around your home.
[01:56:09.298 --> 01:56:11.878]  It has a microphone that listens to everything that you do.
[01:56:11.978 --> 01:56:20.340]  So not only are they tracking us and collecting all of our data, every single click, every single move we make on the internet, but now they want to do it in our homes.
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:21.760]  I don't think so.
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:24.701]  I don't think I'm going to allow Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook to do that.
[01:56:24.701 --> 01:56:24.981]  Absolutely.
[01:56:25.001 --> 01:56:25.601]  It's absolute insanity.
[01:56:25.621 --> 01:56:27.502]  This camera actually literally tracks you around your home.
[01:56:27.742 --> 01:56:29.403]  They have a microphone on you 24-7.
[01:56:29.423 --> 01:56:33.204]  It's dialed to your voice print to dial everything else out but your voice, which means it can listen through walls.
[01:56:47.907 --> 01:56:49.007]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:49.087 --> 01:56:51.888]  And this thing will be on 24-7.
[01:56:52.048 --> 01:56:55.369]  I guarantee developers will be able to exploit it and get into it.
[01:56:55.389 --> 01:56:59.250]  You know, as we've seen, Facebook is not to be trusted with our data.
[01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:01.491]  So anybody that buys this, I really feel bad for them.
[01:57:01.731 --> 01:57:03.751]  They are insane if you put this in your home.
[01:57:03.771 --> 01:57:06.692]  What estimates do you have from Silicon Valley?
[01:57:06.752 --> 01:57:15.155]  I'm told hundreds of thousands of developers have full access to everybody's cloud, everybody's code keys, you know, photos of your wife naked.
[01:57:15.175 --> 01:57:16.535]  I mean, I'm told they've got everything.
[01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:21.871]  Alex, the information that I've heard from some of my friends in Silicon Valley, you would be appalled.
[01:57:22.471 --> 01:57:28.994]  Absolutely appalled at the level of information, the level of access that people who hate us, who want us dead, have access to.
[01:57:29.094 --> 01:57:34.036]  So be very mindful of what you're saying on these platforms and what you're talking about as well.
[01:57:34.917 --> 01:57:38.658]  Well, you've got all the Project Veritas video where they sit around and laugh and go, oh, I read their instant messages.
[01:57:38.738 --> 01:57:39.859]  Oh, I block messages.
[01:57:40.339 --> 01:57:40.879]  I listen to them.
[01:57:40.919 --> 01:57:42.300]  I look at pictures of their wife naked.
[01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:44.401]  We'll be right back in two minutes with Andrew Torba.
[01:57:49.815 --> 01:57:54.964]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[01:57:55.324 --> 01:57:57.408]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[01:57:59.378 --> 01:58:08.387]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Shroyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:08.727 --> 01:58:14.953]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[01:58:15.453 --> 01:58:20.218]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[01:58:20.658 --> 01:58:21.559]  So, what are you waiting for?
[01:58:21.579 --> 01:58:22.260]  Download the app.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.122]  That's so fast, InfoWars.
[01:58:24.482 --> 01:58:27.766]  Apple banned your app.
[01:58:28.507 --> 01:58:30.409]  I helped, too.
[01:58:30.669 --> 01:58:31.611]  Oh, Oliver.
[01:58:36.294 --> 01:58:37.876]  We hate free speech too!
[01:58:37.936 --> 01:58:39.638]  We hate free speech!
[01:58:39.818 --> 01:58:41.460]  We hate free speech!
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:43.242]  We hate free speech!
[01:58:43.382 --> 01:58:45.064]  We hate free speech!
[01:58:45.304 --> 01:58:53.273]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from Infowarslife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.
[01:58:53.293 --> 01:58:55.836]  And listen, everybody's got a heart.
[01:58:56.477 --> 01:59:01.839]  Well, actually, maybe Hillary and George Soros don't, but everybody else has a heart, and this product is amazing.
[01:59:01.919 --> 01:59:12.822]  So, if you have a heart, and you want the very best product out there that's designed to aid a healthy heart and cardiovascular system, it's XtendoWise, available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:13.062 --> 01:59:21.064]  And like all of our products are game changers, this baby is the most souped-up, awesome version the top formative letters could come up with and still be affordable.
[01:59:21.684 --> 01:59:23.426]  It's one of the very best heart pills out there.
[01:59:23.746 --> 01:59:24.506]  It's Xtend-A-Wise.
[01:59:24.727 --> 01:59:27.449]  So, get some for yourself and family and friends.
[01:59:27.829 --> 01:59:30.872]  It's got the very best fish oil from the Fjords.
[01:59:30.912 --> 01:59:36.276]  It's very, very pure, very, very clean and has the EPA type that is specifically good for the heart cardiovascular system.
[01:59:36.956 --> 01:59:40.459]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[01:59:40.780 --> 01:59:42.361]  It is Xtend-A-Wise.
[01:59:42.381 --> 01:59:44.583]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:49.599 --> 01:59:51.387]  You are receiving this transmission.
[01:59:51.769 --> 01:59:52.934]  You are the resistance.
[02:00:11.502 --> 02:00:13.003]  All right, Andrew Torb is our guest.
[02:00:13.043 --> 02:00:15.584]  Did a lot of big development out in Silicon Valley a few years ago.
[02:00:15.624 --> 02:00:18.166]  Decided it was the censorship to start Gab.com.
[02:00:18.986 --> 02:00:27.972]  And now, boy, I mean, if you went through all the stuff Google and Facebook and Twitter have done to him and going after his banking and trying to get his URL shut down and his servicing shut down.
[02:00:28.892 --> 02:00:29.873]  Same stuff we're dealing with.
[02:00:29.973 --> 02:00:34.116]  And it's just, it's organized, it's focused, and it's so authoritarian.
[02:00:34.577 --> 02:00:39.740]  And then to watch the Google executives play dumb to Congress and Facebook and Twitter play dumb.
[02:00:40.261 --> 02:00:47.006]  And like you mentioned, they're now launching this portal that sits there and tracks and watches everything you do in your house.
[02:00:47.907 --> 02:00:49.428]  They just think we're complete idiots.
[02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:51.830]  Andrew, what do you expect them to do next?
[02:00:54.833 --> 02:00:57.995]  Well, Alex, I never expected it to get to this level as fast as it did.
[02:00:58.235 --> 02:01:02.377]  I knew this censorship wave was coming, but I never anticipated that it would be this fast.
[02:01:02.417 --> 02:01:08.761]  And I think what to look for next is during the 2020 election cycle, that's when things are really going to get crazy.
[02:01:08.781 --> 02:01:13.824]  You're going to see a lot of influencers on the right that are going to get shut down, that are going to get suspended.
[02:01:14.144 --> 02:01:18.867]  And one by one, it's like a death by a thousand cuts campaign by big tech.
[02:01:19.207 --> 02:01:27.735]  You know, they take out one influencer this week, they wait a couple weeks, they take out another one, people talk about it for 48 hours and then they get over it and they forget about it and that's what they want.
[02:01:27.775 --> 02:01:33.800]  They're using the same psychology like we're a bunch of little fish that kind of school together hoping we don't get hit next and they're predators.
[02:01:34.641 --> 02:01:37.524]  We have to organize against them instead of acting like idiots.
[02:01:38.852 --> 02:01:42.473]  Absolutely, and the thing to note is that this is not only happening in the United States.
[02:01:42.733 --> 02:01:51.415]  You know, we just had the Brazilian election yesterday and Gab had over 175,000 users join from Brazil because they're being censored as well.
[02:01:51.775 --> 02:02:04.098]  It's everybody that's on the right, everybody that's a part of this populist movement that's happening around the world, is being silenced, is being suppressed, is being shut up, is being suspended, is being no platform, is being shadow banned, is being demonetized.
[02:02:04.478 --> 02:02:06.962]  And it's been happening now for, you know, years.
[02:02:07.042 --> 02:02:08.264]  And it's going to continue to happen.
[02:02:08.544 --> 02:02:09.465]  They're doubling down.
[02:02:09.505 --> 02:02:15.854]  They're going to use artificial intelligence to automatically ban hate speech before it even gets posted now.
[02:02:15.914 --> 02:02:18.378]  And they can expand that definition out to infinity.
[02:02:19.645 --> 02:02:20.145]  Exactly.
[02:02:20.185 --> 02:02:23.027]  Hate speeches, anything that they don't like, any news that they don't like.
[02:02:23.287 --> 02:02:37.934]  Facebook went so far as to censor links from AP, from Bloomberg, from, now we're talking mainstream media outlets that are normally, you know, friends to leftists, but Facebook actually censored leaks about their latest data breach, right?
[02:02:38.214 --> 02:02:45.538]  And then they pushed their PR spin version of it in the face of the user as they were trying to share this AP article.
[02:02:45.978 --> 02:02:47.059]  Absolute insanity!
[02:02:47.439 --> 02:02:48.239]  You know, we're talking about 1984.
[02:02:48.279 --> 02:02:48.839]  Say that again.
[02:02:48.859 --> 02:02:49.560]  Say that again.
[02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:50.880]  You had tens of millions of people.
[02:02:50.920 --> 02:02:51.760]  Well, what was the total number?
[02:02:51.780 --> 02:02:52.100]  It was huge.
[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:52.820]  I forgot last week.
[02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:54.821]  A few weeks ago as they shut down the news.
[02:02:55.541 --> 02:02:56.741]  They steal massive amounts.
[02:02:56.781 --> 02:02:57.882]  They give it away.
[02:02:57.902 --> 02:03:01.063]  They always call it a breach, but they gave it away.
[02:03:01.423 --> 02:03:05.164]  And then when AP and others reported on it and did their job, they blocked that post.
[02:03:05.384 --> 02:03:06.584]  New people were reading it.
[02:03:06.924 --> 02:03:08.504]  And so hit them with propaganda back.
[02:03:08.824 --> 02:03:09.285]  That's the thing.
[02:03:09.305 --> 02:03:13.006]  They don't just ban InfoWars or you off their platforms.
[02:03:13.246 --> 02:03:14.726]  They then lie about us on top of it.
[02:03:15.831 --> 02:03:31.016]  Absolutely, and again, it was a direct link from the AP, and if you tried to share this on Facebook to your friends, they would call it spam and not allow you to actually post it, and then they'd shove their propaganda PR spin version of that story in your face immediately after.
[02:03:31.416 --> 02:03:33.356]  You want to talk about 1984-level stuff?
[02:03:33.616 --> 02:03:39.758]  The telescreen from the 1984 novel is this new portal thing that they just released.
[02:03:40.278 --> 02:03:41.579]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:03:42.499 --> 02:03:48.524]  People like to talk about this, we always like to bring up 1984, but we are literally, this is literally what 1984 is.
[02:03:48.604 --> 02:03:50.526]  Yeah, we're way past it, way past it.
[02:03:51.026 --> 02:03:56.430]  That's it, I mean, Facebook openly rolls out 1984 telescreens, and they want you to pay for them!
[02:03:56.811 --> 02:03:57.471]  Everybody in 1984 hates them!
[02:03:59.548 --> 02:04:24.518]  Right, that's the funny part is they want you to pay to have these listening devices, these tracking devices, these cameras that follow you around your home, these microphones that can hear through walls and block out other random noises in your home to listen directly to what you're saying 24-7, to then sell that information to advertisers, to push ads in your face, to have that data potentially exposed as it has been in the past and hacked,
[02:04:24.938 --> 02:04:28.340]  By foreign actors, by other corporations, by individuals.
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:29.120]  Who knows?
[02:04:29.541 --> 02:04:31.862]  You're absolutely nuts if you trust this company.
[02:04:31.882 --> 02:04:38.326]  You're absolutely nuts if you continue to use these applications and give all your personal and private data to these companies.
[02:04:39.346 --> 02:04:40.327]  Gab.com.
[02:04:40.387 --> 02:04:40.907]  Andrew Torba.
[02:04:40.927 --> 02:04:41.908]  Thank God you're there.
[02:04:41.968 --> 02:04:43.208]  Thank God Gab is exploding.
[02:04:43.228 --> 02:04:44.049]  We're on there as well.
[02:04:44.129 --> 02:04:44.829]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:44.889 --> 02:04:45.310]  Great job.
[02:04:47.831 --> 02:04:48.611]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:48.631 --> 02:04:49.612]  We'll give out the number.
[02:04:49.632 --> 02:04:50.292]  Take your calls.
[02:04:50.312 --> 02:04:52.414]  We have special guests joining us in the studio as well.
[02:04:52.454 --> 02:04:52.974]  Stay with us.
[02:04:57.081 --> 02:05:06.712]  Just a month ago, that Nazi collaborator, anti-American, gun-grabbing, anti-Christian piece of filth, George Soros, bought an even bigger interest in PayPal.
[02:05:07.854 --> 02:05:12.960]  But sure enough, they just told us today that we're going to be banned in 10 days because we're taking.
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.364]  Because we don't support radical Islam and open borders and the rest of it.
[02:05:17.774 --> 02:05:23.237]  Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever, you supporting InfoWars is changing the world.
[02:05:24.178 --> 02:05:27.560]  And yeah, they're getting rid of PayPal, but we have other ways to process your credit cards.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:34.123]  Your financial support of us is literally buying war bonds in the 21st century war for humanity.
[02:05:34.143 --> 02:05:35.424]  So I want to commend you.
[02:05:35.444 --> 02:05:36.465]  I want to thank you.
[02:05:36.505 --> 02:05:38.106]  We've got great products you already need.
[02:05:39.508 --> 02:05:41.149]  But without you, they will win.
[02:05:41.769 --> 02:05:49.212]  And Soros and Obama and Hillary see the shutdown of Infowars as a referendum on breaking the American spirit.
[02:05:49.772 --> 02:05:51.353]  So let's not let these jerks do it.
[02:05:51.733 --> 02:05:53.754]  I'm committed to the end, but I want to win.
[02:05:54.034 --> 02:05:56.735]  So please support Infowars.com today.
[02:05:58.996 --> 02:06:01.157]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:01.677 --> 02:06:06.799]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:17.233 --> 02:06:20.577]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting Worldwide.
[02:06:22.379 --> 02:06:36.475]  And I want to give the number out in this segment and the next specifically on what do you think about Kavanaugh getting confirmed and what do you make of the Democrats and Politico saying after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[02:06:38.953 --> 02:06:47.279]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:06:49.001 --> 02:06:52.784]  I'm also doing fundraising today, because you see it all over the news.
[02:06:53.424 --> 02:07:01.711]  They've put out hundreds of thousands of articles about me, all of it lies, all of it twisted, all of it disinfo, to then set up the precedent to shut everybody down.
[02:07:02.851 --> 02:07:03.512]  That's what's going on.
[02:07:07.665 --> 02:07:09.145]  And it's not working so far for them.
[02:07:09.246 --> 02:07:11.366]  So they're just increasing the tyranny.
[02:07:11.706 --> 02:07:17.648]  Which is what the Democrats are quoted in Politico, in the Washington Post, and other publications saying.
[02:07:19.769 --> 02:07:20.969]  And so they're doxing Congress.
[02:07:20.989 --> 02:07:22.450]  They're threatening to kill people's wives.
[02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:25.731]  They're harassing people en masse.
[02:07:25.751 --> 02:07:29.932]  They're getting more and more out of control.
[02:07:30.372 --> 02:07:33.113]  What do you think, with 29 days out, they're going to pull next? 877.
[02:07:37.743 --> 02:07:38.063]  789-ALEX-877-789-2539.
[02:07:38.223 --> 02:07:42.787]  I want to air a Millie Weaver compilation.
[02:07:42.807 --> 02:07:45.309]  We're going to have more of this when she joins us.
[02:07:45.329 --> 02:07:46.510]  I'm hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:07:46.530 --> 02:07:49.853]  I want to go to this little short compilation.
[02:07:51.114 --> 02:07:57.180]  Some of the stuff she shot, some of the things that others shot, just of the insanity the SJWs
[02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:01.680]  Training for Kung Fu by the Capitol to fight Republicans.
[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:06.183]  People attacking elderly folks with signs that are pro-life.
[02:08:06.764 --> 02:08:09.546]  People howling and chanting and acting like maniacs.
[02:08:09.606 --> 02:08:10.427]  People crying.
[02:08:11.248 --> 02:08:13.229]  I mean, this is what college turns out.
[02:08:13.349 --> 02:08:18.794]  A bunch of broke-back, chip-on-the-shoulder, neurotic, weirdo liars.
[02:08:20.135 --> 02:08:23.157]  In every statistic, way more likely to steal, way more likely to lie.
[02:08:23.438 --> 02:08:27.081]  They're way more likely to virtue signal about charity, but way less likely to give to charity.
[02:08:29.195 --> 02:08:30.696]  And they just want power.
[02:08:30.716 --> 02:08:31.737]  It's like every other loser.
[02:08:31.777 --> 02:08:33.479]  They want to run your life because they don't have a life.
[02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:36.882]  And so what are they going to do?
[02:08:37.022 --> 02:08:38.263]  What are they going to pull?
[02:08:38.863 --> 02:08:40.044]  Here's that short compilation.
[02:08:43.047 --> 02:08:54.477]  This is incredible, wonderful training, folks.
[02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:05.530]  Again, these are women training for combat.
[02:09:06.871 --> 02:09:14.097]  Because they're calling for violence, the left's been calling for violence.
[02:09:14.678 --> 02:09:15.198]  They're playing...
[02:09:19.255 --> 02:09:20.776]  I'll tell you one thing, I'm pretty shook up right now.
[02:09:20.796 --> 02:09:21.196]  And they're crying.
[02:09:21.276 --> 02:09:22.137]  The patriarchy of the white race.
[02:09:22.157 --> 02:09:23.678]  We all want to get into America as quickly as possible, but it's evil.
[02:09:23.698 --> 02:09:24.438]  No, they're almost all white.
[02:09:24.498 --> 02:09:24.598]  Shame!
[02:09:24.618 --> 02:09:24.739]  Shame!

[02:09:56.217 --> 02:09:56.317]  Shame!
[02:09:56.337 --> 02:09:56.477]  Shame!
[02:09:56.497 --> 02:09:56.597]  Shame!
[02:09:56.617 --> 02:09:56.737]  Shame!
[02:09:56.777 --> 02:09:56.877]  Shame!
[02:09:56.897 --> 02:09:56.997]  Shame!
[02:09:57.017 --> 02:09:57.117]  Shame!
[02:09:57.157 --> 02:09:57.257]  Shame!
[02:09:57.277 --> 02:09:57.377]  Shame!
[02:09:57.397 --> 02:09:57.517]  Shame!
[02:09:57.537 --> 02:09:57.638]  Shame!
[02:09:57.658 --> 02:09:57.798]  Shame!
[02:09:57.818 --> 02:09:57.918]  Shame!
[02:09:57.938 --> 02:09:58.038]  Shame!
[02:09:58.058 --> 02:09:58.178]  Shame!
[02:09:58.198 --> 02:09:58.318]  Shame!
[02:09:58.338 --> 02:09:58.438]  Shame!
[02:09:58.458 --> 02:09:58.558]  Shame!
[02:09:59.184 --> 02:10:00.165]  Why should they say no?
[02:10:00.745 --> 02:10:01.926]  He lied under oath.
[02:10:02.666 --> 02:10:04.087]  He lied under oath.
[02:10:04.827 --> 02:10:06.648]  We can't have a Supreme Court justice... Oh really?
[02:10:06.688 --> 02:10:07.709]  Ford was the biggest liar I ever saw.
[02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:13.612]  He is clearly untruthful, who does not have a respect for the basic truth.
[02:10:18.635 --> 02:10:20.957]  And they all cover their mouths like they're being silenced.
[02:10:21.397 --> 02:10:23.138]  What's the left running around silencing everyone?
[02:10:23.618 --> 02:10:27.140]  He's lying.
[02:10:27.180 --> 02:10:28.041]  He's a rapist.
[02:10:28.976 --> 02:10:34.239]  So, gang rapes... So he hasn't been proven in a court of law?
[02:10:34.619 --> 02:10:35.460]  Well, you know what?
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:36.900]  He lied on the stand.
[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:38.341]  He has perjured himself.
[02:10:39.061 --> 02:10:39.962]  I like beer.
[02:10:40.762 --> 02:10:41.703]  What about his yearbook?
[02:10:41.783 --> 02:10:42.843]  Devil's Triangle.
[02:10:42.863 --> 02:10:44.384]  These people are unbelievable.
[02:10:44.444 --> 02:10:47.186]  How about the F-F-F-F-Fourth of July?
[02:10:47.346 --> 02:10:49.167]  But he said he likes beer on the stand.
[02:10:49.827 --> 02:10:52.008]  He does like beer, but he likes more than beer.
[02:10:52.088 --> 02:10:54.350]  How is that a lie to say he likes beer?
[02:10:55.230 --> 02:10:57.011]  In high school, he liked beer.
[02:10:57.091 --> 02:10:58.312]  Well, my God, execute him.
[02:11:01.397 --> 02:11:03.018]  Arrest sexual predators!
[02:11:03.458 --> 02:11:04.639]  Not protesters!
[02:11:04.679 --> 02:11:05.900]  You are a subhuman!
[02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:07.362]  We're done being- Look at these soyboys now.
[02:11:07.462 --> 02:11:08.062]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:08.102 --> 02:11:09.223]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:09.664 --> 02:11:10.925]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:11.365 --> 02:11:12.586]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:13.046 --> 02:11:14.508]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:14.648 --> 02:11:16.209]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:16.469 --> 02:11:16.850]  It's okay.
[02:11:16.890 --> 02:11:18.351]  Black lives matter!
[02:11:18.471 --> 02:11:21.374]  We understand, we're- Black lives matter!
[02:11:21.394 --> 02:11:22.595]  This is the mental illness, folks.
[02:11:24.478 --> 02:11:29.704]  Meanwhile, thousands of times more blacks killed blacks than the police killed blacks.
[02:11:29.744 --> 02:11:32.628]  This is the hate, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:11:33.769 --> 02:11:37.353]  This is what you send your kids to college for.
[02:11:37.653 --> 02:11:43.400]  They all just virtue signal and all get hysterical.
[02:11:54.108 --> 02:12:00.514]  They just say black lives matter like people don't think that and like then it makes you racist.
[02:12:00.814 --> 02:12:02.916]  The Supreme Court, see they worship the government.
[02:12:03.477 --> 02:12:07.260]  So the fact we're taking it back is like their God is being taken.
[02:12:07.380 --> 02:12:16.349]  We're gonna have more of this when Millie Weaver joins us coming up in the fourth hour.
[02:12:17.475 --> 02:12:19.576]  And we're going to take some of your calls right now.
[02:12:19.636 --> 02:12:22.816]  Let's talk to Dean in Richmond, Virginia.
[02:12:22.876 --> 02:12:24.197]  Dean, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:12:24.477 --> 02:12:25.557]  Thanks for joining InfoWars.
[02:12:31.318 --> 02:12:33.339]  Are we back to our old phone system issues?
[02:12:35.559 --> 02:12:36.219]  Hello, Dean.
[02:12:36.239 --> 02:12:38.180]  All right.
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:39.180]  I know when to cut them.
[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:40.280]  I know when to fold them.
[02:12:40.760 --> 02:12:41.761]  I know when to walk away.
[02:12:42.281 --> 02:12:42.941]  I know when to run.
[02:12:46.107 --> 02:12:47.828]  Notice we've had incredible calls lately.
[02:12:48.868 --> 02:12:51.009]  And then sometimes the phone system glitches.
[02:12:52.290 --> 02:12:53.911]  And no one talks when I go to them.
[02:12:54.811 --> 02:12:56.312]  And then my blood pressure goes up.
[02:12:57.052 --> 02:12:58.753]  Should I even dare?
[02:12:59.834 --> 02:13:01.554]  I shall not dare where eagles dare!
[02:13:02.555 --> 02:13:03.455]  I shall not take calls.
[02:13:03.555 --> 02:13:04.556]  Maybe next segment, who knows.
[02:13:04.876 --> 02:13:08.898]  Now, there's a lot I haven't gotten to yet as well here.
[02:13:10.134 --> 02:13:16.677]  And I really want to drill into this attack on free speech as well, because they're attacking the very bedrock of communication now.
[02:13:17.957 --> 02:13:20.819]  People are apologizing for Winston Churchill support.
[02:13:21.159 --> 02:13:23.560]  Columbus State no longer a holiday for the namesake city.
[02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.761]  Austin didn't rename the name or something else.
[02:13:27.261 --> 02:13:29.082]  This is what I want to get to when we come back.
[02:13:29.122 --> 02:13:30.103]  Meanwhile, video.
[02:13:30.163 --> 02:13:32.043]  Male feminist kicks pro-life woman in the face.
[02:13:32.323 --> 02:13:32.864]  That's okay.
[02:13:32.924 --> 02:13:35.565]  Asylum seeker brutally rapes child who was teaching him German.
[02:13:36.544 --> 02:13:39.885]  Then just cover all that up, because it's all part of this big utopia.
[02:13:39.945 --> 02:13:40.805]  No, it's not a utopia.
[02:13:41.065 --> 02:13:41.945]  It's total domination.
[02:13:43.866 --> 02:13:45.046]  Now, I'll get back to this again.
[02:13:46.066 --> 02:13:49.307]  The globalists are trying to shut us down with everything they've got.
[02:13:50.227 --> 02:13:51.407]  We make it a 360 win.
[02:13:51.887 --> 02:13:59.049]  I sell great products that are high quality, whether they're non-GMO heirloom seeds, or water filtration, or L-filtration, or supplements, or T-shirts.
[02:13:59.709 --> 02:14:01.730]  It's about getting the word out and about making your life better.
[02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:02.970]  We've got the best supplements.
[02:14:03.837 --> 02:14:06.880]  They're all free shipping and 50% off.
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:11.404]  That was going to be the Christmas and the Black Friday special and the Cyber Monday special.
[02:14:11.464 --> 02:14:14.307]  And we had the warehouse in with the product to do it.
[02:14:14.667 --> 02:14:15.928]  Some of the products were about to sell out.
[02:14:15.968 --> 02:14:16.769]  More was coming in later.
[02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:19.091]  I'm just selling it all out of 50% off.
[02:14:20.672 --> 02:14:23.295]  So they are successful shutting down all our payment processors for a while.
[02:14:25.577 --> 02:14:26.498]  We won't be dead in the water.
[02:14:27.901 --> 02:14:29.082]  We'll have funds to continue on.
[02:14:29.102 --> 02:14:32.224]  So get the products you already need and get the Christmas gifts.
[02:14:32.284 --> 02:14:33.765]  Christmas is only a couple months away.
[02:14:35.366 --> 02:14:40.649]  So instead of battling the big lines and, you know, all the rest of it when that comes, give your family some colloidal silver.
[02:14:40.669 --> 02:14:41.469]  Give them some bodies.
[02:14:41.529 --> 02:14:42.470]  Ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:14:42.930 --> 02:14:43.971]  95% curcumin in level.
[02:14:44.371 --> 02:14:44.931]  50% off.
[02:14:45.172 --> 02:14:46.312]  And that's off the regular price.
[02:14:46.332 --> 02:14:49.554]  That's not like we raise the price like they do on fake Black Friday and then lower it.
[02:14:49.774 --> 02:14:51.856]  No, it's lowered from its regular low price.
[02:14:52.316 --> 02:14:53.577]  Alpha power is amazing.
[02:14:53.637 --> 02:14:54.337]  DNA force.
[02:14:54.818 --> 02:14:55.758]  All of it is incredible.
[02:14:56.158 --> 02:14:56.679]  Real red pill.
[02:14:58.151 --> 02:14:59.812]  Plus is incredible with energy added.
[02:14:59.832 --> 02:15:02.253]  The incredible knockout formula.
[02:15:02.633 --> 02:15:03.894]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:15:05.374 --> 02:15:08.236]  Super Silver Wound Cleanze.
[02:15:08.256 --> 02:15:08.236]  $19.98.
[02:15:08.276 --> 02:15:09.216]  It's sold in stores for $50.
[02:15:09.897 --> 02:15:10.737]  We private label it.
[02:15:10.777 --> 02:15:12.778]  It's FDA over-the-counter approved.
[02:15:14.113 --> 02:15:14.914]  It's all there.
[02:15:15.194 --> 02:15:16.656]  Our latest Happys formula.
[02:15:17.136 --> 02:15:22.762]  Super blue, colloidal silver, iodine, fortified, fluoride-free, mouthwash, immune gargle, and the toothpaste.

[02:15:33.513 --> 02:15:40.520]  Just want to move it, move it, move it, move it to get ready for whatever's coming into the storm, batting down the hatches.
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:42.441]  Infowarsstore.com.

[02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:53.772]  It's an incredible super sale.
[02:15:57.346 --> 02:15:57.666]  I don't
[02:16:19.582 --> 02:16:22.265]  Christine Ford is questioned about her fear of flying.
[02:16:22.506 --> 02:16:25.890]  And her boyfriend, former boyfriend, said she was never afraid of flights.
[02:16:26.070 --> 02:16:29.354]  And I sat there and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test.
[02:16:29.374 --> 02:16:29.775]  Here it is.
[02:16:30.596 --> 02:16:33.079]  May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington?
[02:16:35.414 --> 02:16:36.414]  In an airplane.
[02:16:38.175 --> 02:16:46.317]  I asked that because it's been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying.
[02:16:46.637 --> 02:16:47.517]  Is that true?
[02:16:47.537 --> 02:16:55.339]  I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request.
[02:16:55.579 --> 02:16:59.440]  That was certainly what I was hoping, was to avoid having to get on an airplane, but
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:06.504]  I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane.
[02:17:07.185 --> 02:17:17.772]  I also saw on your CV that you list the following interests of surf travel and you in parentheses put Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific Islands, and French Polynesia.
[02:17:18.073 --> 02:17:19.433]  Have you been all to those places?
[02:17:19.914 --> 02:17:20.374]  Correct.
[02:17:21.015 --> 02:17:21.775]  By airplane?
[02:17:22.115 --> 02:17:22.376]  Yes.
[02:17:22.976 --> 02:17:25.017]  Oh, but she couldn't fly the week before.
[02:17:25.137 --> 02:17:26.198]  She was afraid.
[02:17:26.518 --> 02:17:27.199]  I'm afraid.
[02:17:27.239 --> 02:17:28.480]  I'm a little baby.
[02:17:30.365 --> 02:17:41.191]  I work in Implanted Memories at a DARPA facility and do stuff for the Defense Language School and everything, but I, my whole family's in the CIA, and I level, but I'm a sweet little lady.
[02:17:41.532 --> 02:17:43.293]  Oh, you make me talk like a baby.
[02:17:43.493 --> 02:17:44.413]  So, continuing.
[02:17:44.493 --> 02:17:44.994]  Here she is.
[02:17:45.214 --> 02:17:50.577]  Ford explains why she decided to take a polygraph test, and now they've had the FBI guy on Fox.
[02:17:50.737 --> 02:17:51.398]  We've got the clip.
[02:17:51.418 --> 02:17:52.418]  He gave her two questions.
[02:17:52.438 --> 02:17:56.280]  You give someone 20-plus questions if it's a real one, and still it's not conclusive.
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:58.061]  A real polygraph has over 100 questions.
[02:17:59.142 --> 02:18:02.266]  After she put together the statement and then you interviewed her, these are the two questions you asked.
[02:18:02.666 --> 02:18:04.228]  Is any part of your statement false?
[02:18:04.408 --> 02:18:04.988]  She said no.
[02:18:05.269 --> 02:18:06.830]  Did you make up any part of your statement?
[02:18:06.850 --> 02:18:07.831]  Her answer was no.
[02:18:07.852 --> 02:18:14.399]  I don't know a lot about polygraph tests, but to me reading this from the outside it seemed that I would expect many more questions.
[02:18:14.479 --> 02:18:16.261]  Is this standard to just have the two?
[02:18:16.281 --> 02:18:16.341]  Yes.
[02:18:17.061 --> 02:18:17.341]  It is.
[02:18:17.661 --> 02:18:19.982]  And, you know, especially when you do victims.
[02:18:20.002 --> 02:18:22.063]  It's very rare in law enforcement.
[02:18:22.083 --> 02:18:25.345]  I spent most of my, obviously, my career in working with the FBI.
[02:18:25.925 --> 02:18:28.726]  You don't normally give polygraph tests to victims.
[02:18:28.866 --> 02:18:30.607]  You represent victims, okay?
[02:18:30.787 --> 02:18:40.611]  And you believe them, unless you have some corroborating evidence that there's something about this person's allegations that you found some corroborate that you don't believe.
[02:18:41.151 --> 02:18:42.072]  But she got two.
[02:18:43.032 --> 02:18:44.474]  Let's continue.
[02:18:44.734 --> 02:18:50.983]  I was happy to undergo the polygraph test, although I found it extremely stressful.
[02:18:52.645 --> 02:18:54.268]  Much longer than I anticipated.
[02:18:55.757 --> 02:18:59.898]  I told my whole life story, I felt like, but I endured it.
[02:18:59.918 --> 02:19:01.098]  It was fine.
[02:19:01.278 --> 02:19:04.579]  Have you ever taken any other polygraphs in your life?
[02:19:05.199 --> 02:19:05.500]  Never.
[02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:14.862]  Have you ever had discussions with anyone besides your attorney on how to take a polygraph?
[02:19:16.278 --> 02:19:17.440]  Never.
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:17.880]  Oh, no.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:20.363]  She just knows about mind control, not about polygraphs.
[02:19:20.784 --> 02:19:24.388]  Just any sort of tips or anything like that.
[02:19:24.408 --> 02:19:25.069]  No, no.
[02:19:25.890 --> 02:19:26.731]  No, I was...
[02:19:27.671 --> 02:19:29.873]  I'm scared of the test itself.
[02:19:29.913 --> 02:19:31.173]  Oh, she's scared!
[02:19:31.193 --> 02:19:31.974]  Hit pause.
[02:19:32.334 --> 02:19:33.735]  She's like, I'm scared!
[02:19:34.115 --> 02:19:35.697]  I'm scared I can't fly!
[02:19:36.137 --> 02:19:37.378]  I can't in my little shell!
[02:19:37.618 --> 02:19:44.583]  But the reviews in college said she's the worst, she's vindictive, she's lazy, she's horrible, she's into group hypnosis, brainwashing.
[02:19:44.643 --> 02:19:46.804]  But she's scared, little girl!
[02:19:46.904 --> 02:19:48.886]  I mean, who do you think they're gonna get to go up and say this?
[02:19:49.226 --> 02:19:53.129]  A mind control doctor hooked into DARPA, the whole family's the CIA, I rest my case.
[02:19:59.253 --> 02:20:11.124]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.327 --> 02:20:19.312]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:22.395 --> 02:20:24.637]  There must be some way out of here.
[02:20:26.730 --> 02:20:28.031]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:20:28.131 --> 02:20:30.332]  You know, I knew that world government was real.
[02:20:30.352 --> 02:20:32.794]  I knew it planned to transfer U.S.
[02:20:33.315 --> 02:20:36.137]  assets and control to the globalists in China, mainly.
[02:20:36.918 --> 02:20:45.764]  But I didn't know how far along it was until Trump got in and then they revealed themselves at Davos and everywhere, literally worshipping the Chinese dictator.
[02:20:46.625 --> 02:20:48.567]  Him saying, don't worry, I'll defeat Trump in America.
[02:20:49.047 --> 02:20:51.849]  And Juncker shaking his hand and saying, we'll crush America together.
[02:20:51.869 --> 02:20:52.950]  I mean, this was quoted.
[02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:54.491]  We will crush the U.S.
[02:20:54.891 --> 02:20:55.492]  in a trade war.
[02:20:55.512 --> 02:20:56.493]  We will crush Trump.
[02:20:57.473 --> 02:20:59.675]  Because Trump said, no more one-sided deals, jerks.
[02:21:01.636 --> 02:21:05.279]  And so they just have this giant metaphysical hard-on for us.
[02:21:07.401 --> 02:21:09.322]  And we're in World War IV.
[02:21:10.463 --> 02:21:13.485]  The Pentagon rightfully calls the Cold War World War III.
[02:21:14.522 --> 02:21:15.442]  This is World War 4.
[02:21:15.502 --> 02:21:31.689]  It's asymmetrical, using Arab Spring, using jihadis, using economic war, using the chi-coms, using the EU, using Hollywood, using all of the traitorous anti-American scum trained and hypnotically programmed to hate this country and to hate themselves.
[02:21:34.109 --> 02:21:35.090]  And now they're making their move.
[02:21:35.110 --> 02:21:42.813]  So I open the phones up to ask callers specifically when Democrats are in the Washington Post and they're in
[02:21:44.517 --> 02:21:49.466]  Politico and others saying, after failing to stop Kavanaugh, Dems wonder if it's time to be more ruthless.
[02:21:50.147 --> 02:21:54.575]  They've got quotes by top Democrats saying, we're going to get more vicious, more aggressive, more violent.
[02:21:57.912 --> 02:22:01.034]  Top Dem, Trump, GOP must pay a price for Kavanaugh.
[02:22:01.054 --> 02:22:14.364]  Then I've got all the beheading videos and threatens to murder everybody and then Twitter and Facebook just lets Democrats run around saying chop Kavanaugh's testicles off, murder Congress, murder their families and the left's like, yeah, murder, murder, death, blah!
[02:22:15.728 --> 02:22:20.172]  And then I'm like, man, Antifa says they're doxing Congress' homes and law enforcement's homes.
[02:22:20.492 --> 02:22:27.058]  If you've been doxed and you're in the federal law enforcement, or you're in Congress, you better have a battle rifle next.
[02:22:27.298 --> 02:22:29.380]  Jones says murder the media with guns!
[02:22:30.101 --> 02:22:32.904]  Then I talked to some folks this weekend that talked to some FBI people.
[02:22:33.917 --> 02:22:39.541]  In Florida, and they found out that they worked with Infowars, and literally got scared, went, Alex Jones!
[02:22:39.721 --> 02:22:41.422]  You think I want the FBI to be scared of me?
[02:22:42.223 --> 02:22:43.944]  But these aren't normal FBI people.
[02:22:43.984 --> 02:22:48.827]  These are weird, whacked-out leftist men who literally believe I'm like Hitler.
[02:22:50.428 --> 02:22:54.210]  So they believe in all the craziness they're doing that they're fighting evil people.
[02:22:55.051 --> 02:22:56.092]  Doesn't mean it's the whole FBI.
[02:22:57.645 --> 02:23:06.127]  I was talking to this well-known person that ran into some FBI folks, and they, when they found out that the person worked at Infowars, literally got scared.
[02:23:10.828 --> 02:23:12.208]  I'm not killing political dissidents.
[02:23:12.648 --> 02:23:13.709]  I don't have any criminal record.
[02:23:14.469 --> 02:23:17.830]  I just believe in America and free market and the Second Amendment and mom and apple pie.
[02:23:18.470 --> 02:23:23.611]  And I'm informed about what's happening, so I'm sorry it's scary that the New World Order is so evil.
[02:23:24.915 --> 02:23:35.104]  And that you think it's so scary that someone would stand up against him, but just because you guys put out a couple hundred thousand articles saying I'm the most evil thing since Godzilla, it's not true!
[02:23:36.785 --> 02:23:47.855]  And that's what really freaks me out, is that it's so cut and dry that Trump's loving, but standing up for himself, and then he's trying to fix the country, and then he cares about everybody, and then he's being pragmatic.
[02:23:54.778 --> 02:23:55.538]  I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:23:55.578 --> 02:23:56.379]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:23:56.419 --> 02:23:57.559]  And we have a special guest joining us.
[02:23:57.599 --> 02:24:03.021]  We'll intersperse what he's going to cover with your calls about how they've escalated this whole situation.
[02:24:03.081 --> 02:24:05.822]  But I just want you to understand something.
[02:24:06.462 --> 02:24:17.926]  This is a power grab by ruthless globalists who believe that they are invincible and who believe they can get away with anything they want.
[02:24:20.029 --> 02:24:23.710]  And who believe they can just bully everybody, and they don't have any basement.
[02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:28.672]  You know, Lee Stranahan was on yesterday, co-hosting with me, and he made a really good point we ought to queue up.
[02:24:29.032 --> 02:24:38.516]  It was about 10 minutes into his talk, or 8 minutes into his talk, because I marked it last night when I listened to the rebroadcast of him.
[02:24:40.516 --> 02:24:47.439]  He talked about when his baby daughter died, and because he had gone from being a big liberal to working with Breitbart,
[02:24:49.144 --> 02:24:53.045]  And they made a joke about his dead daughter in a bunch of big leftist publications.
[02:24:53.065 --> 02:24:54.385]  So that's what they do.
[02:24:55.766 --> 02:24:59.767]  How he realized, Republicans have their issues, but they've got a basement.
[02:25:01.167 --> 02:25:02.568]  There's only so far they'll sink.
[02:25:03.468 --> 02:25:08.049]  And Democrats claim they're all moral, but they're not Democrats like your grandpa.
[02:25:08.509 --> 02:25:10.690]  They are a whacked out group of crazies.
[02:25:12.310 --> 02:25:13.050]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:25:13.631 --> 02:25:14.651]  I've never been against police.
[02:25:15.803 --> 02:25:20.604]  But I don't like the police state that the government was trying to turn police into, and no due process.
[02:25:22.084 --> 02:25:31.927]  But when I saw them, when I noticed YouTube wouldn't shadow ban us like five years ago when I'd bash police sometimes, then they would promote everywhere to get like 10 million views.
[02:25:32.527 --> 02:25:36.167]  But if I said something good about cops, you could see it would be demonetized and shadow banned.
[02:25:36.187 --> 02:25:38.548]  This was about six years ago, and I went, man, that's weird.
[02:25:40.017 --> 02:25:49.385]  I'm showing cops that helped somebody, did something good, saved a woman in a drowning in a car, and the cop almost died, and you know, one cop did die, and then they banned that.
[02:25:49.985 --> 02:25:50.566]  They blocked it.
[02:25:51.446 --> 02:25:57.972]  That's when I started to get more sophisticated, and I went, they want us to fight with the police so they get more radicalized, so they can come in and federalize them.
[02:25:58.973 --> 02:26:01.154]  And I said, we've got to do something.
[02:26:01.214 --> 02:26:02.315]  And I started to get more sophisticated.
[02:26:02.335 --> 02:26:03.436]  Then I saw Strong Cities.
[02:26:03.796 --> 02:26:04.396]  They wanted the U.N.
[02:26:04.416 --> 02:26:04.996]  to run the police.
[02:26:05.377 --> 02:26:13.681]  And I saw on CNN and MSNBC, when they shot those five cops in Dallas, then they shot some more cops in Louisiana the next week, two weeks later.
[02:26:14.422 --> 02:26:16.183]  And I saw the same talking point.
[02:26:16.563 --> 02:26:18.624]  Well, cops are bad and they better learn.
[02:26:19.065 --> 02:26:21.906]  Until they stop being brutal and evil, they're going to get killed.
[02:26:21.926 --> 02:26:26.109]  That would be one thing if you thought a cop really killed your family member and you had proof.
[02:26:27.250 --> 02:26:28.891]  And you knew something happened and you went after him.
[02:26:28.951 --> 02:26:31.633]  I'm not saying do that, but I could see it.
[02:26:33.194 --> 02:26:50.766]  But when cops do something wrong in Missouri, which it turned out they didn't, and then you go kill cops in Dallas, randomly, or you go shoot cops in the back of the head in Houston, or in Oakland, and then CNN is, well, this is what you get.
[02:26:50.786 --> 02:26:56.810]  At that point I went, oh my God, like four or five years ago, I went, they're worse than I thought.
[02:26:58.243 --> 02:27:04.825]  How does shooting a sheriff's deputy in the back of the head, because CNN's saying cops are bad, what does that do?
[02:27:05.766 --> 02:27:07.066]  Where's the due process there?
[02:27:07.166 --> 02:27:08.667]  Where's the innocence until proven guilty?
[02:27:09.207 --> 02:27:10.548]  Where's the statute of limitations?
[02:27:10.828 --> 02:27:12.128]  Because it's not even in debate.
[02:27:12.248 --> 02:27:13.909]  They did nothing.
[02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:17.150]  And it's like, oh, you're kissing the pig's ass now.
[02:27:19.131 --> 02:27:27.354]  And it made me realize how I used to take the little guy view, the underdog view, the left poses, that it would still buy a lot of leftist propaganda, even though I was more of a libertarian.
[02:27:28.695 --> 02:27:32.857]  The left never liked me because I was pro-life, pro-gun, but I would buy their Antifa crap.
[02:27:33.058 --> 02:27:48.687]  And when Antifa tried to pipe bomb and kill people and tried to firebomb a place where they thought I worked, I bought the left's propaganda that it was the setup and actually went with their crap on air, talking about Brandon Darby, who's, I know people that know him, he's a great, hardworking guy.
[02:27:49.007 --> 02:27:57.152]  And I literally, 10 years ago, repeated crap that wasn't true by people that are founding members of Antifa that is sworn to destroy me.
[02:27:59.070 --> 02:27:59.570]  Think about that.
[02:28:00.131 --> 02:28:12.758]  The left could spin planned attacks on me and on a bookstore that I was affiliated with, and someone tries to expose it, and then the left spins it and turns it into the person exposing it's the bad guy, and I bought it.
[02:28:14.479 --> 02:28:18.721]  So yeah, I've done a lot of stuff, but I get smarter every year just like you do.
[02:28:19.462 --> 02:28:21.643]  And it's that hindsight.
[02:28:23.114 --> 02:28:29.335]  That we now look at where it just totally flips the script and you're like, oh my god, these people don't care about justice.
[02:28:29.995 --> 02:28:33.376]  All they do is manipulate those of us that have a conscience.
[02:28:34.436 --> 02:28:36.957]  And they just had me eating out of their hand.
[02:28:37.337 --> 02:28:40.357]  And I was a leftist at many levels and didn't even know it.
[02:28:41.798 --> 02:28:43.678]  Because they say a lot of stuff that sounds good.
[02:28:45.779 --> 02:28:47.219]  But now they've shown who they really are.
[02:28:48.259 --> 02:28:52.780]  A bunch of race war pushing authoritarians who want to overthrow local government for the globalists.
[02:29:02.728 --> 02:29:12.012]  Riding shotgun with me is Rufio Panman, on Facebook for now, at Rufio Panman PB, and Instagram, Rufio underscore Panman.
[02:29:12.092 --> 02:29:13.573]  Listen, we don't have a choice.
[02:29:13.653 --> 02:29:15.114]  Think about how bad the globalists are.
[02:29:15.134 --> 02:29:17.655]  If they get control, that's what we should be worrying about.
[02:29:17.695 --> 02:29:19.156]  It's not a sacrifice we're making.
[02:29:19.176 --> 02:29:21.837]  You know, we can trick ourselves and say, oh, we're making these sacrifices.
[02:29:21.897 --> 02:29:22.057]  No.
[02:29:22.597 --> 02:29:27.560]  The real sacrifice would be letting real tyranny come in, because they want to break America's back and teach us a lesson.
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:28.020]  Yeah.
[02:29:28.550 --> 02:29:28.930]  Definitely.
[02:29:29.371 --> 02:29:36.456]  Get into just your background, your life, type of Americana guy that never got politically involved until he saw women and children getting beaten up.
[02:29:37.837 --> 02:29:39.858]  Well, you know, I've always been pretty patriotic.
[02:29:39.878 --> 02:29:42.400]  You know, I grew up on country music.
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:47.543]  You know, I've always just kind of been very passive and kind of a shy person.
[02:29:47.944 --> 02:29:52.367]  And it wasn't until recently after Trump got elected, obviously, where everything started to get crazy.
[02:29:52.387 --> 02:29:56.850]  And I started seeing people getting attacked in the streets for wearing a Trump hat.
[02:29:57.750 --> 02:30:00.212]  And I just knew that that wasn't something I could stand for.
[02:30:00.232 --> 02:30:01.513]  I didn't want to see that come to my city.
[02:30:01.553 --> 02:30:05.015]  I didn't want to see, you know, my future children have to deal with that.
[02:30:06.015 --> 02:30:10.678]  So I started getting involved and that's when I met Proud Boys, Gavin McInnes' group that he created back in 2016.
[02:30:12.699 --> 02:30:26.946]  And it's ever since then it's just been a you know a bit a huge learning experience and seeing what's really happening You know once you kind of test the waters you start to see what's under the surface and it's it's really ugly when you start to you know see what's under the surface a lot of evil stuff going on and
[02:30:27.426 --> 02:30:31.127]  Leftist cities, leftist police defending people that attack women and children.
[02:30:31.147 --> 02:30:31.887]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:30:32.207 --> 02:30:34.128]  You know, it doesn't really get any worse than that.
[02:30:34.808 --> 02:30:38.949]  But hopefully, you know, we'll cross our fingers and hope it doesn't get worse than that and kind of get a handle on it.
[02:30:38.969 --> 02:30:43.970]  But again, you know, that requires a lot of support from other people other than just us.
[02:30:44.370 --> 02:30:46.711]  Go and support your fellow patriots and their businesses.
[02:30:46.771 --> 02:30:51.312]  If you know somebody who's a, you know, loves America and they're running a business, go support their business.
[02:30:51.892 --> 02:30:56.633]  Because right now, business is being attacked and it's on a grand scale.
[02:30:57.493 --> 02:30:58.174]  All over the nation.
[02:30:58.455 --> 02:31:05.083]  But I'll tell you right now, when you have, when our boys are out there, when our proud boys are out there strong, it's the strongest feeling.
[02:31:05.304 --> 02:31:10.651]  It's almost palpable, the energy of the freedom, the American spirit running through the streets.
[02:31:10.791 --> 02:31:12.793]  And I think that once they start to see
[02:31:13.534 --> 02:31:16.456]  You know, these quote-unquote casualties happen around them.
[02:31:16.616 --> 02:31:21.118]  It's extremely intimidating to see the, you know, the American spirit and raw force like that.
[02:31:21.478 --> 02:31:23.359]  And, you know, that's what we have going for us.
[02:31:23.399 --> 02:31:26.280]  And as long as we can keep that going, we can be extremely effective.
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:27.321]  It's all organic.
[02:31:27.501 --> 02:31:29.562]  And all this stuff, none of this stuff is scripted out.
[02:31:30.102 --> 02:31:33.164]  It's a bunch of rats attacking people's free speech.
[02:31:33.504 --> 02:31:33.884]  Exactly.
[02:31:35.587 --> 02:31:42.714]  I just, it's so, I keep saying this, I did not imagine being a bunch of men and going out and trying to target somebody in a wheelchair or a woman.
[02:31:42.754 --> 02:31:46.258]  I just, I mean, I would never kill myself, but if I was like that, I would kill myself.
[02:31:46.278 --> 02:31:46.779]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:55.536 --> 02:32:03.761]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:32:03.941 --> 02:32:05.201]  Believe me, I know.
[02:32:05.422 --> 02:32:09.744]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:32:10.164 --> 02:32:15.167]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:32:15.407 --> 02:32:35.638]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:32:36.158 --> 02:32:39.900]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:32:39.920 --> 02:32:43.581]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:32:43.862 --> 02:32:48.364]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:32:48.884 --> 02:32:50.865]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:32:51.605 --> 02:32:54.667]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:59.169 --> 02:33:01.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:45.532 --> 02:33:54.720]  Conrad Padilla is going to ride shotgun with us for about an hour, and then Millie Weaver is going to be joining us with a lot of exclusive video of the leftist insanity during the Kavanaugh situation.
[02:33:55.561 --> 02:34:04.049]  Infowarsyes.com, and yes, I am going to be in between taking calls on what do you think the globalists are going to do next, destabilize the country, and a bunch of clips that are coming up.
[02:34:04.069 --> 02:34:04.970]  We're going to take your calls.
[02:34:06.551 --> 02:34:13.034]  I am going to be up here infomercialing, something I do to fund our operation, and something I would encourage our radio affiliates to get involved with InfoWars.
[02:34:13.054 --> 02:34:21.077]  Yes, with your own affiliates, because this is a great business, especially for media companies to be involved in, and it's great for our listeners to be involved in.
[02:34:21.137 --> 02:34:22.258]  Business is one side of it.
[02:34:22.618 --> 02:34:24.579]  We talked about that last time Conrad was here.
[02:34:25.655 --> 02:34:32.477]  Uh, this time I want to get into the products themselves, because listen, I'm not a big metrosexual type guy, even though I probably should be.
[02:34:33.198 --> 02:34:34.238]  Those guys take care of themselves.
[02:34:34.878 --> 02:34:39.420]  I showed up here about two weeks ago to shoot news, and Rob Due goes,
[02:34:40.697 --> 02:34:42.098]  Why don't you try the eye cream?
[02:34:42.418 --> 02:34:43.980]  Conrad really wants you to do that.
[02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:46.662]  You know, you want to boost sales over at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:34:46.682 --> 02:34:48.503]  This is rated the best eye cream in the world.
[02:34:48.543 --> 02:34:51.445]  I go, yeah, I've already heard that from my wife when we got them as a sponsor.
[02:34:51.465 --> 02:34:52.026]  I already know that.
[02:34:52.346 --> 02:34:56.309]  So when you purchase stuff at InfoWarsYes.com, you get the best deals and part of it goes to funder operation.
[02:34:56.649 --> 02:34:58.410]  So they even shut us down on our shopping cart.
[02:34:58.430 --> 02:34:59.631]  You know, we have sponsors like this.
[02:35:00.712 --> 02:35:01.393]  And I did it.
[02:35:01.413 --> 02:35:02.794]  We're going to play this later.
[02:35:02.894 --> 02:35:04.355]  Radio listeners have got to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:35:06.983 --> 02:35:10.128]  So, they set up the camera real quick, because I was going to shoot somewhere else.
[02:35:10.169 --> 02:35:11.070]  I was going out to do a shoot.
[02:35:12.693 --> 02:35:16.859]  I literally just go, okay, and they barely have the cameras even focused, and they get it going.
[02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:19.944]  Three minutes later, my bags, which are big,
[02:35:21.764 --> 02:35:24.688]  Uh, that's part of an Anglo-Saxon skull anyway.
[02:35:24.708 --> 02:35:27.551]  It's just big, large, you know, eye holes that go down further.
[02:35:27.671 --> 02:35:30.514]  That's how you can tell a skull, whether it's a white skull or an Asian skull or whatever.
[02:35:30.975 --> 02:35:33.017]  They have, kind of like, shaped like that, sort of like that.
[02:35:33.618 --> 02:35:35.981]  Because that's part of the deal, is that large eye holes.
[02:35:36.461 --> 02:35:39.384]  And both eyes have been in a lot of fights back in high school, so they've been beat in pretty good.
[02:35:39.765 --> 02:35:41.086]  But they were really, really puffy.
[02:35:41.747 --> 02:35:50.471]  And so now when I do a video shoot, or I'm going to do an ad, one of them would really look good for anything, or going on national TV, I don't put makeup on, but I do put this on, because the bags go away.
[02:35:50.511 --> 02:35:51.352]  I should have put it on today.
[02:35:51.392 --> 02:35:52.693]  In fact, I didn't think of this.
[02:35:52.793 --> 02:35:55.434]  Later, I should probably do it again, maybe next hour.
[02:35:55.734 --> 02:35:57.115]  Just live on TV.
[02:35:57.615 --> 02:35:58.716]  Next hour, we'll do it.
[02:35:59.356 --> 02:36:00.456]  If we have any of the eye creams.
[02:36:00.496 --> 02:36:01.257]  Mine's, oh, there it is.
[02:36:01.317 --> 02:36:01.597]  Ageless.
[02:36:02.257 --> 02:36:02.918]  Instantly ageless.
[02:36:03.792 --> 02:36:06.413]  So you can see, because my wife has tried three or four other brands.
[02:36:06.433 --> 02:36:11.134]  When she saw this, she said, oh, I got some of that from my cousin when I was in Omaha last year.
[02:36:11.354 --> 02:36:12.474]  Can you get me more?
[02:36:12.794 --> 02:36:13.814]  That works the best.
[02:36:14.194 --> 02:36:15.615]  Not that my wife has much bag.
[02:36:15.655 --> 02:36:17.055]  She's gorgeous, but she thinks she does.
[02:36:18.015 --> 02:36:18.796]  And I said, yeah.
[02:36:18.856 --> 02:36:20.656]  And I tried the stuff she has.
[02:36:20.876 --> 02:36:21.796]  Didn't really do much.
[02:36:22.276 --> 02:36:24.857]  So it is rated out there as the best eye cream.
[02:36:24.877 --> 02:36:25.757]  That's only one product.
[02:36:25.957 --> 02:36:27.077]  I didn't mean to go right into it.
[02:36:27.178 --> 02:36:27.638]  He's here.
[02:36:28.058 --> 02:36:28.838]  But the fact is,
[02:36:30.009 --> 02:36:38.116]  A whole family of products at InfoWarsYes.com from the Jeunesse line, and the reason they're great is they're bigger outside the U.S.
[02:36:38.136 --> 02:36:38.916]  than they even are here.
[02:36:39.197 --> 02:36:40.798]  They're now coming here to the U.S.
[02:36:40.838 --> 02:36:49.886]  They've been here for a while, but the great part is we can then use them to sponsor some very exciting things that Little Birdies told me about that are going to be happening in Europe very, very soon.
[02:36:49.906 --> 02:36:50.826]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[02:36:51.807 --> 02:36:52.988]  These are amazing products.
[02:36:53.028 --> 02:36:54.129]  Conrad, thanks for coming.
[02:36:54.609 --> 02:36:57.812]  This time, let's pitch them the products here, and then we'll get to calls and news and the rest of it.
[02:36:57.832 --> 02:36:59.273]  But we're self-funding.
[02:36:59.313 --> 02:37:02.216]  The whole name of the game is, shut us down, take us off air.
[02:37:02.876 --> 02:37:03.857]  Well, what do I do?
[02:37:04.077 --> 02:37:05.739]  I go out and I find the very best products.
[02:37:05.879 --> 02:37:07.960]  I know you guys have the best line.
[02:37:08.361 --> 02:37:12.644]  The whole stay-at-home business, MLM, is just one angle, because it is.
[02:37:12.664 --> 02:37:14.586]  If you're going to be selling something, you want to sell the best.
[02:37:14.666 --> 02:37:15.347]  It sells itself.
[02:37:16.067 --> 02:37:17.228]  We already promoted that before.
[02:37:17.268 --> 02:37:18.168]  People should get involved.
[02:37:18.228 --> 02:37:18.808]  It's amazing.
[02:37:19.348 --> 02:37:21.249]  Because the name of Jeunesse is so good.
[02:37:21.309 --> 02:37:25.311]  But regardless, the products are unbelievable.
[02:37:25.331 --> 02:37:27.872]  So thanks for joining us and just give us an overview of these products.
[02:37:28.232 --> 02:37:32.233]  Okay, so the key to the product you were talking about is Instantly Ageless.
[02:37:32.253 --> 02:37:33.254]  So what that basically is, is
[02:37:33.914 --> 02:37:36.115]  I mean, who out there wants bags underneath your eyes?
[02:37:36.155 --> 02:37:38.795]  Whether you're a female, male, it doesn't really matter.
[02:37:38.835 --> 02:37:40.295]  At the end of the day, nobody wants bags.
[02:37:40.756 --> 02:37:48.597]  What's great about this product, and this product's been highlighted all on, you know, all types of top shows and everything else, is that it works within about two minutes.
[02:37:48.977 --> 02:37:52.558]  About two minutes, what it does is the bags literally go away.
[02:37:52.578 --> 02:37:54.259]  In fact, I could even use some myself today.
[02:37:54.279 --> 02:37:55.419]  Geez, I'm looking at myself right now.
[02:37:55.759 --> 02:37:56.119]  We're good to go!
[02:38:16.357 --> 02:38:22.101]  So male, female, this is a product that works, like I said, in about two minutes up to eight hours, okay, called Instantly Ageless.
[02:38:22.301 --> 02:38:26.324]  Okay, so go to Infowarsyes.com and you can go on there and order this stuff.
[02:38:26.344 --> 02:38:31.888]  This stuff, you know, bags are a global problem, so it's not something that just happens in, you know, here in the United States or anything like that.
[02:38:31.908 --> 02:38:34.730]  So this product is one of the top selling products in the world.
[02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:40.774]  You can see some of the other things that it obviously does as well, but what's great about all these products is
[02:38:41.494 --> 02:38:50.027]  All the Janess products is they take care of the inside and take care of the outside because at the end of the day, you may, you know, what's the point of taking care of bags if you're not taking care of yourself at a cellular level?
[02:38:50.047 --> 02:38:52.630]  So some of the products that we have like A.M.P.M.
[02:38:52.690 --> 02:38:56.556]  and some of the products that we have, they'll take care of you at the cellular level.
[02:38:56.776 --> 02:39:00.139]  There's so much stress, there's so many toxins, people are aging at rapid levels.
[02:39:00.399 --> 02:39:05.342]  An article right here, human race faces extinction if male sperm count continues to fall worldwide.
[02:39:05.382 --> 02:39:07.444]  In major studies, people are missing iodine.
[02:39:07.944 --> 02:39:09.225]  You can't produce sperm.
[02:39:09.545 --> 02:39:10.766]  I mean, a lot of this is very simple.
[02:39:10.786 --> 02:39:16.150]  So you're taking care of the inside, you're taking care of the outside, and that's why it's so exciting.
[02:39:16.190 --> 02:39:20.033]  And then again, we're not funded by George Soros or taxpayers or Democratic money.
[02:39:20.333 --> 02:39:23.856]  We're funded good old-fashioned, bringing products to the listeners.
[02:39:24.036 --> 02:39:28.299]  Yeah, that's actually a guy who can use like a few boxes of this stuff actually.
[02:39:28.359 --> 02:39:29.660]  He can use a whole tub of Ageless.
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:30.861]  You talking about George Soros?
[02:39:30.881 --> 02:39:31.421]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:39:31.562 --> 02:39:32.782]  A big tub of that stuff.
[02:39:32.862 --> 02:39:34.304]  I mean, he's got some serious bags.
[02:39:34.824 --> 02:39:35.905]  Might want to consider sleeping.
[02:39:36.581 --> 02:39:37.942]  But let's get back to Ageless just briefly.
[02:39:38.062 --> 02:39:41.104]  Why is it the best, I mean, literal eye cream product out there?
[02:39:41.144 --> 02:39:43.746]  I mean, even online people say, it's the rage.
[02:39:43.786 --> 02:39:45.487]  People go, oh, you're with Janess now.
[02:39:45.747 --> 02:39:46.928]  Oh my God, have you seen the videos?
[02:39:47.008 --> 02:39:47.849]  I tried it, it's real.
[02:39:48.409 --> 02:39:50.550]  I run into women that come up and go, I didn't believe it.
[02:39:50.991 --> 02:39:52.952]  I've been using it for two years.
[02:39:52.972 --> 02:39:54.093]  You're right, Alex, isn't it great?
[02:39:54.293 --> 02:39:55.674]  Because women have tried it all.
[02:39:55.694 --> 02:39:56.654]  It is the best.
[02:39:57.475 --> 02:39:58.977]  Yeah.
[02:39:58.997 --> 02:40:03.681]  There's quite a few products on the market, but the thing about it though is most of them don't work for very long.
[02:40:03.701 --> 02:40:07.285]  I mean, you can look at this product within just a short period of time.
[02:40:07.305 --> 02:40:08.105]  You said four hours.
[02:40:08.186 --> 02:40:11.248]  I went back on TV like eight hours later, my bags were gone.
[02:40:11.289 --> 02:40:11.509]  Yeah.
[02:40:11.709 --> 02:40:12.850]  It'll go up to 10 hours.
[02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:14.512]  So this will work up to 10 hours.
[02:40:14.952 --> 02:40:18.155]  Works on a little bit of crow's feet, other things like that.
[02:40:18.175 --> 02:40:20.618]  But what's great about this product, you guys, is
[02:40:21.158 --> 02:40:23.580]  Look, look around right now as far as who you are.
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:26.222]  I mean, how many people can benefit just from this one product, okay?
[02:40:26.743 --> 02:40:30.065]  But, you also have to look at the fact, like, even the Nevo product, okay?
[02:40:30.726 --> 02:40:32.247]  Who doesn't have energy challenges?
[02:40:32.367 --> 02:40:33.788]  Everybody has energy challenges.
[02:40:33.828 --> 02:40:37.051]  I mean, we live in a society where everybody has a phone glued to their face.
[02:40:37.111 --> 02:40:38.232]  I mean, it's been proven.
[02:40:38.692 --> 02:40:40.273]  Can I have an ounce of that genius, please?
[02:41:01.147 --> 02:41:01.407]  Yeah.
[02:41:01.567 --> 02:41:02.288]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:02.448 --> 02:41:03.449]  This is my favorite.
[02:41:03.810 --> 02:41:03.970]  Yeah.
[02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:04.170]  Yeah.
[02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:05.071]  I love Rainforest.
[02:41:05.091 --> 02:41:06.592]  This has got some of the same stuff in Rainforest.
[02:41:06.873 --> 02:41:06.993]  Yeah.
[02:41:07.013 --> 02:41:10.156]  But it's got some other things, and it just... Talk about clean energy, man.
[02:41:10.476 --> 02:41:10.616]  Yeah.
[02:41:10.676 --> 02:41:12.538]  I was going to do Coast to Coast AM like a month ago.
[02:41:12.638 --> 02:41:13.459]  Totally exhausted.
[02:41:13.479 --> 02:41:13.839]  Yeah.
[02:41:13.899 --> 02:41:14.600]  Like 9 o'clock.
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:15.741]  Coffee doesn't work.
[02:41:15.801 --> 02:41:16.102]  Boom.
[02:41:16.542 --> 02:41:19.044]  Had a mind from Janess from InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:41:19.065 --> 02:41:19.305]  Yeah.
[02:41:19.605 --> 02:41:19.885]  Boom!
[02:41:20.206 --> 02:41:24.712]  Yeah, so the thing about the Mind product is everybody has a cell phone, right?
[02:41:24.892 --> 02:41:32.502]  Everybody, I mean, have you ever been to dinner or lunch with somebody and, you know, they're having a conversation with you and they're looking at their phone at the same time?
[02:41:32.563 --> 02:41:36.948]  I mean, our attention span and our focus has gone to, you know, to the toilet, to be honest with you.
[02:41:37.669 --> 02:41:41.812]  I mean, I just had one on before I got on right now and it really does help with focus.
[02:41:42.232 --> 02:41:49.697]  If you lack focus from technology or you need, you know, maybe you're in college and you need to take an exam, you have an exam coming, this stuff works.
[02:41:49.777 --> 02:41:56.321]  It really, really does help with focus and some of the other things that people have issues with, which is just dialing it in.
[02:41:56.341 --> 02:41:57.322]  And here's the bottom line.
[02:41:57.982 --> 02:42:00.723]  I could have had 200 MLM companies.
[02:42:00.743 --> 02:42:01.583]  You're not an MLM company.
[02:42:01.603 --> 02:42:05.464]  That's just one vehicle you've got for people to have it as a business and then also make money when they sign others up.
[02:42:05.924 --> 02:42:06.605]  It sells itself.
[02:42:07.385 --> 02:42:08.885]  You have such great word of mouth.
[02:42:09.045 --> 02:42:10.666]  You started in Europe and Asia.
[02:42:10.686 --> 02:42:11.866]  Now it's exploding in the U.S.
[02:42:12.206 --> 02:42:14.427]  So a business model is great for our listeners to get involved in.
[02:42:14.647 --> 02:42:16.068]  But as a product, it's even better.
[02:42:16.408 --> 02:42:19.529]  So that's why I bring it, even though I'm a big supplement seller myself.
[02:42:19.869 --> 02:42:21.229]  It's mainly we fund ourselves.
[02:42:21.269 --> 02:42:24.010]  Your stuff's so good that I wanted to be involved in it.
[02:42:24.130 --> 02:42:41.006]  Yeah, well the products are, the great part about this is what's interesting too is, you know, what I love about what Alex is doing is you're empowering people with InfoWarsYes.com and we'll come back and talk about that because I really want to talk about how you're empowering people around the globe because people are buying this product from all over the world from you since you launched InfoWarsYes.
[02:42:41.206 --> 02:42:41.946]  And that's another good thing.
[02:42:41.986 --> 02:42:48.030]  You guys have warehouses in other parts of the world, so that doesn't have the huge shipping cost of getting InfoWars live products around the world.
[02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.430]  Right.
[02:42:48.610 --> 02:42:48.871]  Exactly.
[02:42:48.891 --> 02:42:49.851]  So that's really smart.
[02:42:49.891 --> 02:42:50.492]  Well, that's exciting.
[02:42:50.512 --> 02:42:54.034]  From Australia, to China, to Europe, Malaysia.
[02:42:55.914 --> 02:42:58.194]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:42:58.674 --> 02:43:04.675]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:43:04.956 --> 02:43:06.676]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[02:43:55.951 --> 02:43:56.412]  Look at that.
[02:43:56.432 --> 02:44:01.363]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[02:44:01.384 --> 02:44:02.546]  We didn't do that.
[02:44:04.201 --> 02:44:08.302]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[02:44:08.722 --> 02:44:10.382]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:44:10.962 --> 02:44:19.504]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[02:44:19.964 --> 02:44:21.665]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:44:21.705 --> 02:44:22.825]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:44:23.525 --> 02:44:26.026]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:44:26.066 --> 02:44:27.146]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[02:44:27.926 --> 02:44:30.867]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[02:44:33.709 --> 02:44:35.030]  Liquid consciousness.
[02:44:38.434 --> 02:44:38.794]  Look it up.
[02:44:39.895 --> 02:44:40.396]  Find out.
[02:44:42.458 --> 02:44:45.901]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[02:44:45.941 --> 02:44:50.806]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[02:44:51.267 --> 02:44:53.489]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[02:44:53.529 --> 02:44:54.370]  InfoWareStore.com.

[02:46:59.205 --> 02:47:01.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.466 --> 02:47:11.447]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:11.887 --> 02:47:13.208]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:14.349 --> 02:47:18.230]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[02:47:19.311 --> 02:47:21.652]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[02:47:21.952 --> 02:47:28.095]  Friend as in any wonder, lightning strikes me.
[02:47:30.216 --> 02:47:34.479]  I fought with the devil, got down on his knees.
[02:47:34.499 --> 02:47:35.359]  Well, ain't that the truth.
[02:47:35.559 --> 02:47:38.801]  But I never gave in, so he gave up on me.
[02:47:41.751 --> 02:47:45.232]  Conrad Padilla with InfoWarsYes.com is riding shotgun with us.
[02:47:45.292 --> 02:47:50.854]  I'm gonna get your calls about what do you think the Democrats are planning next now that they've lost as soon as we start the next hour.
[02:47:51.154 --> 02:47:53.175]  He'll ride shotgun with us and Millie Weaver's joining us.
[02:47:53.755 --> 02:47:57.277]  And I know we've talked privately, you're a libertarian guy, but I want to talk about Janesh because...
[02:47:58.517 --> 02:48:07.862]  You guys, when you ended up basically seeking me out as well, and I'd already been talking about you with George Norrie, it was synchronicity.
[02:48:07.902 --> 02:48:08.722]  It was really strange.
[02:48:09.182 --> 02:48:17.366]  And then to find out that my wife knew who you were and liked you, and I talked to other people that were into your energy drink, and then I went and looked you up, just your great name.
[02:48:17.767 --> 02:48:20.748]  That's why I'm really proud to have you guys working with us to help support the broadcast.
[02:48:21.348 --> 02:48:26.271]  And if our local radio affiliates, next we should probably find some way to
[02:48:27.330 --> 02:48:44.180]  Set it up for them as well so that they can become direct promoters of this and sellers of this because more and more that's the model on TV and radio that is successful with the sponsorship is just to direct sell to your listeners and then help fund the industry.
[02:48:44.640 --> 02:48:47.502]  But so many people shy away from that but I think that's really the future.
[02:48:47.862 --> 02:48:49.824]  Well, it is, and that's why we call it the perfect business.
[02:48:49.904 --> 02:48:54.528]  I mean, where are you going to go out there to be able to get involved in a business?
[02:48:54.548 --> 02:49:01.155]  I mean, if you look at most businesses that are out there today, like even a franchise, people go spend several hundred thousand dollars on buying a franchise.
[02:49:01.295 --> 02:49:03.197]  I mean, the reality is, is they got to have the building.
[02:49:03.477 --> 02:49:04.338]  They got to have the building.
[02:49:04.378 --> 02:49:04.938]  They got to have the.
[02:49:05.439 --> 02:49:06.860]  But who has several hundred thousand dollars?
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:11.144]  You know, most people, most people that are out there don't have several hundred thousand dollars to go start a business.
[02:49:11.164 --> 02:49:16.689]  So, the challenge with this profession is sometimes people, have you ever heard this thing called the Alex Repulse?
[02:49:16.709 --> 02:49:18.670]  People say it's a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:19.171 --> 02:49:19.391]  Yes.
[02:49:19.431 --> 02:49:19.591]  Right.
[02:49:19.932 --> 02:49:22.033]  Well, let me explain what a pyramid is.
[02:49:22.854 --> 02:49:23.094]  That's great.
[02:49:38.650 --> 02:49:40.651]  That is a pyramid that I don't want to be part of.
[02:49:41.211 --> 02:49:42.431]  That's traditional America.
[02:49:42.471 --> 02:49:43.851]  That's what it was like on Wall Street.
[02:49:43.891 --> 02:49:48.592]  When I worked on Wall Street, this is the way that it was, and this is the way it is for most companies that are out there today.
[02:49:48.973 --> 02:49:53.634]  What's great about the network marketing profession, because people say sometimes, well, it's a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:54.814 --> 02:49:55.914]  This is a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:56.514 --> 02:49:58.915]  When people work for a traditional company, that's a pyramid scheme.
[02:49:58.935 --> 02:49:59.515]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:49:59.595 --> 02:50:01.996]  Some of the MLMs, if like Ponzi,
[02:50:02.896 --> 02:50:06.158]  Pay out more money up front than they're really bringing in, and get more people to join.
[02:50:06.358 --> 02:50:07.078]  There have been some.
[02:50:07.218 --> 02:50:10.020]  Any business, any investment could turn into a pyramid scheme.
[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:14.142]  They're afraid of people using real MLMs.
[02:50:14.182 --> 02:50:17.184]  Even though you're not even an MLM, that's just a model for people to sell if they want.
[02:50:17.424 --> 02:50:19.965]  You're all about the incredible products at Genes, that's why I did it.
[02:50:20.726 --> 02:50:25.208]  I can do hundreds of MLMs that are legitimate, they're just not the best products, so I'm not doing it.
[02:50:25.528 --> 02:50:26.769]  This is so kick-butt,
[02:50:27.449 --> 02:50:31.472]  And then it's got the business angle on top of it is why I love it and why I'm supporting it.
[02:50:31.732 --> 02:50:33.233]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[02:50:33.333 --> 02:50:33.553]  Yeah.
[02:50:33.974 --> 02:50:36.395]  So you have really good products that people reorder.
[02:50:36.415 --> 02:50:41.099]  And what's cool about this is people are ordering products from around the globe from you guys.
[02:50:41.119 --> 02:50:47.043]  I mean, you have sales, you have people buying products from Sweden, Canada, Malaysia, Australia, obviously North America.
[02:50:47.463 --> 02:50:50.165]  So people are buying products from you guys all over the world.
[02:50:50.245 --> 02:50:54.068]  But you also have a lot of people around the globe that are also partnering with you because
[02:50:54.728 --> 02:50:56.670]  You have essentially empowered a lot of people.
[02:50:56.690 --> 02:51:05.297]  You've empowered people with InfoWars, and you've empowered a lot of people with the opportunity as well with InfoWarsYes.com, and you've empowered some people who want to take advantage of the opportunity.
[02:51:05.818 --> 02:51:14.705]  So for some of the people that are out there today, what you're essentially doing is you're allowing them to be able to create an income stream alongside potentially what they're doing in their job.
[02:51:14.846 --> 02:51:15.906]  And again, I look at the numbers.
[02:51:16.835 --> 02:51:18.076]  A, I've already heard about these products.
[02:51:18.196 --> 02:51:19.257]  A, they're top-rated everywhere.
[02:51:19.277 --> 02:51:21.138]  When I go look it up, I keep hearing about it everywhere.
[02:51:21.739 --> 02:51:25.021]  And then, I enjoy the products, and so it's a win-win.
[02:51:25.061 --> 02:51:28.264]  I mean, if this stuff's already exploding, but that's another question.
[02:51:28.304 --> 02:51:29.605]  Why'd you guys start in Asia?
[02:51:29.625 --> 02:51:31.606]  Tell us about the company instead of North America.
[02:51:31.646 --> 02:51:38.211]  Yeah, so the reason the company started in Asia, because the thing about the Asian community, they're really into skin care.
[02:51:38.231 --> 02:51:42.775]  I mean, skin care for the Asian community, it's up there with like oxygen.
[02:51:42.895 --> 02:51:45.176]  It's all about the class.
[02:51:45.196 --> 02:51:46.697]  But they also embrace network marketing.
[02:51:46.737 --> 02:51:53.581]  Oh, and I'm in Hawaii or somewhere, like the Japanese and the Koreans, like big hats and they have like veils and they're just all into their skin.
[02:51:53.621 --> 02:51:54.341]  Yeah, they're all into it.
[02:51:54.641 --> 02:51:57.182]  So in North America, it's a little bit different.
[02:51:57.202 --> 02:52:02.645]  So what happened is the company focused there, but what's happened now is they've come to North America right now.
[02:52:02.745 --> 02:52:05.587]  Obviously, Alex, you saw the opportunity with InfoWars, yes?
[02:52:06.247 --> 02:52:11.469]  And I think the key here now is what's happening in North America now is a lot of people are getting involved here.
[02:52:11.870 --> 02:52:14.831]  But the cool part is it's still very early here in North America.
[02:52:15.051 --> 02:52:15.531]  Well, exactly.
[02:52:15.571 --> 02:52:17.272]  I want the opposite of a Ponzi scheme.
[02:52:17.292 --> 02:52:21.094]  I want people to have great products, fun the show, and then I want them to get in
[02:52:22.034 --> 02:52:24.317]  When you guys are now coming into the U.S.
[02:52:24.357 --> 02:52:28.562]  and already exploding and rocketing towards the top, that's the time from the business angle to get in.
[02:52:28.702 --> 02:52:28.922]  Right.
[02:52:29.102 --> 02:52:31.865]  I want my hardcore listeners to be in on the ground level.
[02:52:31.966 --> 02:52:32.186]  Right.
[02:52:32.406 --> 02:52:39.034]  Well, the beautiful part is most people don't realize that your income is the most powerful thing that you could possibly have for you and your family.
[02:52:39.554 --> 02:52:41.396]  Your income is your most powerful wealth building tool.
[02:52:41.416 --> 02:52:41.916]  That's the truth.
[02:52:42.056 --> 02:52:46.621]  I mean, the reality is the more income that you have coming into your household, the better, right?
[02:52:46.981 --> 02:52:49.623]  Because, you know, a lot of people don't realize that you have residual bills.
[02:52:49.663 --> 02:52:50.845]  Your bills come in no matter what.
[02:52:51.445 --> 02:52:52.726]  No matter what happens, your bills come in.
[02:52:53.167 --> 02:52:56.129]  What if you could have potentially more than one income stream?
[02:52:56.149 --> 02:52:58.472]  And that's what this opportunity that you have put out there.
[02:52:58.492 --> 02:53:03.917]  I mean, Alex, you have put something out there with this incredible platform with respect to InfoWars to empower people.
[02:53:04.781 --> 02:53:12.346]  Now what you've done is you're empowering people with InfoWarsYes.com to be able to go out there and create another income stream to be able to bring into their household.
[02:53:12.446 --> 02:53:14.948]  Well, listen, my philosophy is a 360 win.
[02:53:15.508 --> 02:53:21.552]  If I like something and it's good, and I know it's a good product, and it's going to help me and it's going to help them, that's what I go for.
[02:53:21.793 --> 02:53:21.973]  Right.
[02:53:22.353 --> 02:53:27.416]  It's got to be, because quite frankly, I've turned down hundreds of these, a lot of them were good deals, but they were already huge in the U.S.
[02:53:28.417 --> 02:53:33.140]  Why not get people involved in something that's been huge everywhere else, but it's coming here last?
[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:38.963]  It's the ground floor chain reaction angle is what I want to tell my listeners.
[02:53:39.143 --> 02:53:40.824]  I think that, like, here's an example.
[02:53:41.205 --> 02:53:42.545]  I told folks to get into gold when it was at 300.
[02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:44.620]  And I wrote it all the way up to 2000.
[02:53:45.081 --> 02:53:49.022]  And I said, I think it'll go back to like 5000, maybe 10, 15 years from now.
[02:53:49.503 --> 02:53:52.924]  But I started telling people when it was 1900, I said, get out of it.
[02:53:53.404 --> 02:53:54.725]  And I had a lot of sponsors get mad.
[02:53:54.745 --> 02:53:55.785]  A lot of people get pissed at me.
[02:53:56.386 --> 02:53:58.667]  And I said, no, I'm not promoting gold anymore.
[02:53:58.687 --> 02:54:04.029]  I said, maybe silver, because I think gut level that for a while, it's not going to go back up.
[02:54:04.409 --> 02:54:05.910]  Now, everybody appreciated that.
[02:54:06.350 --> 02:54:11.772]  So that's basically what I do is if I'm gut level and do my research, then that's when I go for something.
[02:54:12.032 --> 02:54:12.613]  And gut level,
[02:54:13.513 --> 02:54:15.895]  Well, I know who you guys are getting lined up and the things you're doing.
[02:54:15.915 --> 02:54:19.297]  I already was wanting to do this and then I found out you're playing.
[02:54:19.337 --> 02:54:21.919]  I'm like, oh yeah, this is big.
[02:54:22.019 --> 02:54:22.679]  Well, you're right.
[02:54:22.719 --> 02:54:24.620]  I mean, a lot of people are joining you, by the way.
[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:31.225]  Because a lot of these countries I talked about, you have a lot of people that are actually joining you from around the globe because they know that you know what you're talking about.
[02:54:31.565 --> 02:54:39.350]  But the second part of that too, though, is you guys have to remember that one of the things that you can do for you and your family, though, is, and I said this earlier, is
[02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:45.253]  You can have another income stream that comes in for you and your household that you maybe don't have.
[02:54:45.293 --> 02:54:48.955]  If you lost your job tomorrow, what are you going to do to pay your residual bills?
[02:54:49.376 --> 02:54:49.596]  Right?
[02:54:49.816 --> 02:54:52.077]  Oh, they're trying to take our payment processors right now.
[02:54:52.657 --> 02:54:54.739]  So I didn't even bring you guys on board because I was worried about that.
[02:54:54.759 --> 02:54:55.799]  But I'm like, well, great.
[02:54:55.919 --> 02:54:57.440]  Thank God they shut us down.
[02:54:57.700 --> 02:54:59.181]  Hopefully you guys can fund us.
[02:54:59.201 --> 02:55:01.382]  I mean, it's that common sense.
[02:55:01.462 --> 02:55:03.544]  You always want to have an ace in the hole.
[02:55:03.784 --> 02:55:03.944]  Yeah.
[02:55:04.304 --> 02:55:06.205]  Well, and that's the thing about Janus.
[02:55:06.245 --> 02:55:07.905]  Janus is in 141 countries.
[02:55:08.365 --> 02:55:10.326]  They're a proven global company.
[02:55:10.346 --> 02:55:12.186]  Tell people how big it is.
[02:55:12.246 --> 02:55:12.507]  Yeah.
[02:55:13.187 --> 02:55:14.767]  So they're a multi-billion dollar company.
[02:55:14.907 --> 02:55:18.008]  You know, they've done the last few years, they've done over a billion dollars in sales.
[02:55:18.048 --> 02:55:19.849]  And as I said, they're in 141 countries.
[02:55:20.569 --> 02:55:25.971]  Why would anybody not want to be part of a company that's already proven to have incredible success?
[02:55:25.991 --> 02:55:27.231]  30 million in 2010.
[02:55:27.611 --> 02:55:29.112]  By 2015, a billion.
[02:55:29.532 --> 02:55:30.332]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:30.352 --> 02:55:31.392]  So 2015, they did a billion.
[02:55:31.432 --> 02:55:32.693]  In fact, what's interesting is
[02:55:33.493 --> 02:55:37.395]  If you look at these sales right here, look at this, and they're doing it primarily without North America.
[02:55:37.855 --> 02:55:38.896]  And so what's the trending now?
[02:55:38.916 --> 02:55:41.257]  Because I know everything's always a few years ago.
[02:55:41.297 --> 02:55:41.557]  Yeah.
[02:55:41.577 --> 02:55:41.817]  Yeah.
[02:55:41.877 --> 02:55:45.219]  So, so 2017, they did 1.4 billion, somewhere in that area.
[02:55:45.259 --> 02:55:49.061]  Now 2000 and, you know, this year they're projected to do a billion plus.
[02:55:49.081 --> 02:55:50.461]  That's just in one year, you guys.
[02:55:50.481 --> 02:55:51.242]  And here's the cool part.
[02:55:51.562 --> 02:55:54.123]  They're doing it primarily without the sales in North America.
[02:55:54.163 --> 02:55:56.104]  These are sales primarily from outside the U.S.
[02:55:56.184 --> 02:56:00.126]  So the opportunity... Yeah, if you look at the circles where the profits are, it's not in the U.S.
[02:56:00.506 --> 02:56:01.227]  Right, exactly.
[02:56:01.827 --> 02:56:12.112]  So, with InfoWars Yes, when you go to InfoWarsYes.com, and I think the key for you is that you're able to join Alex in creating a movement here in North America.
[02:56:12.152 --> 02:56:13.653]  And by the way, people are already doing that.
[02:56:13.693 --> 02:56:18.055]  Like I said, lots and lots of people from around the globe right now are joining InfoWars Yes.
[02:56:18.115 --> 02:56:19.155]  And that's what I'm trying to do.
[02:56:19.195 --> 02:56:24.698]  I'm trying to get our most hardcore listeners with a great product line and something for them to get in on the first level of.
[02:56:24.918 --> 02:56:27.639]  Right, and that's what you've created, and a lot of people know that.
[02:56:28.079 --> 02:56:32.720]  A lot of people that are involved in this type of profession, they won't even look at a company unless they're at least five years old.
[02:56:32.740 --> 02:56:37.841]  Janessa's about nine, ten years old, and so what's great about it is you're already involved in a company.
[02:56:37.861 --> 02:56:39.681]  That's one of the reasons why... Well, I did another MLM company.
[02:56:39.701 --> 02:56:40.962]  These are great people, great folks.
[02:56:41.482 --> 02:56:46.223]  You know, I started out there like 15, 20 million, and they went up to like 80-something million a year just with my promotion.
[02:56:46.363 --> 02:56:51.024]  Yeah, so let's talk about... Unfortunately, it just didn't bring in, you know, enough for us to fund our operation.
[02:56:51.124 --> 02:56:51.404]  Right.
[02:56:51.644 --> 02:56:55.325]  Well, let's think about network marketing, the network marketing profession, for example, okay?
[02:56:55.765 --> 02:57:03.206]  You have, you know, you have no alarm clock, you have no boss, you have nobody that you have to report to, you have, you know, low startup.
[02:57:03.266 --> 02:57:07.487]  I mean, who in the world has six figures plus to go start a traditional business out there?
[02:57:07.547 --> 02:57:08.387]  Most people don't.
[02:57:08.547 --> 02:57:10.228]  Most people want to have their own business.
[02:57:10.248 --> 02:57:15.689]  Everybody's heard similar pitches, but this is a great company with a proven track record, and I'll say this before we start the next hour and take calls.
[02:57:17.185 --> 02:57:17.965]  It's about the product.
[02:57:18.226 --> 02:57:20.207]  I would tell listeners, go to InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:20.527 --> 02:57:22.148]  You love the products at InfoWarsStore.com?
[02:57:22.588 --> 02:57:23.469]  Would I bring you stuff?
[02:57:23.869 --> 02:57:24.989]  Our stuff, you know, is game-changing.
[02:57:25.310 --> 02:57:27.751]  I'm bringing this because it's a unicorn.
[02:57:27.791 --> 02:57:30.913]  It's got everything you want at one place.
[02:57:31.473 --> 02:57:32.654]  Try out some of the products.
[02:57:32.734 --> 02:57:34.075]  See how great it is, like I did.
[02:57:34.535 --> 02:57:36.356]  And then, become a distributor if you want.
[02:57:36.676 --> 02:57:37.877]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:37.957 --> 02:57:38.897]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:39.237 --> 02:57:40.758]  Hour number two, a ton of news.
[02:57:40.858 --> 02:57:42.019]  Millie Weaver, your calls.
[02:57:42.299 --> 02:57:43.540]  And more with Conrad straight ahead.
[02:58:01.124 --> 02:58:11.007]  Drew's only been here about four or five months, and he's behind the camera right now, and I've just done this big pitch for our new product for women that is the best products, the best ingredients we can come up with.
[02:58:11.027 --> 02:58:13.208]  And he said, man, you need to reshoot this.
[02:58:13.888 --> 02:58:15.429]  Literally 20 seconds ago, and I said, what?
[02:58:16.434 --> 02:58:18.078]  He goes, what's that Virginia Slims ad?
[02:58:18.098 --> 02:58:23.068]  And I went, oh, the one about empowering women smoking cigarettes and killing themselves.
[02:58:23.129 --> 02:58:25.514]  He goes, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[02:58:27.728 --> 02:58:29.729]  And that just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:39.813]  So hundreds of millions of women died of lung cancer because the whole feminist movement from the 20s and the 40s was funded by the cigarette makers to get women to smoke.
[02:58:39.893 --> 02:58:45.416]  And they continue that line into the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s saying, you've come a long way.
[02:58:45.856 --> 02:58:47.577]  You can smoke Virginia Slims.
[02:58:47.977 --> 02:58:49.337]  You too can die of lung cancer.
[02:58:49.958 --> 02:58:52.739]  So Stephen Colbert and all these programs demonized me.
[02:58:53.419 --> 02:58:58.740]  For promoting known herbs, known vitamins, known trace minerals that are so critical to women.
[02:58:58.980 --> 02:59:00.661]  My God, iodine is absolutely king.
[02:59:01.081 --> 02:59:01.761]  The good allergy.
[02:59:02.041 --> 02:59:08.743]  And then I'm the bad guy all over the news for promoting healthy formulas, but they are promoting pure poison.
[02:59:08.783 --> 02:59:11.584]  So, hey, yeah, women, you've come a long way.
[02:59:11.624 --> 02:59:13.504]  The families are broken up, society's falling apart.
[02:59:13.544 --> 02:59:14.444]  We're good to go.
[02:59:47.665 --> 02:59:51.786]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:52.286 --> 02:59:53.627]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.269 --> 03:00:05.970]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[03:00:06.530 --> 03:00:07.631]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.795 --> 03:00:11.796]  All right, some stations don't carry this segment.
[03:00:12.597 --> 03:00:13.437]  Next segment, they do.
[03:00:13.477 --> 03:00:18.521]  We're going to get to your calls, get into some politics, get into people that don't want progress versus those that do.
[03:00:19.141 --> 03:00:21.322]  Conrad from Jeunesse is riding shotgun with us.
[03:00:21.342 --> 03:00:27.146]  He heads up InfoWarsYes.com, which is the best discounts you're going to find out there on these products at InfoWars store.
[03:00:27.846 --> 03:00:32.870]  But I wanted to air the video that literally, I guess, two, three weeks ago, I come in here on the weekend.
[03:00:33.550 --> 03:00:37.813]  Rob Do goes, hey, they keep wanting us, you know, to shoot a video with the eye cream.
[03:00:38.877 --> 03:00:40.920]  And he goes, your bags are pretty bad today.
[03:00:41.841 --> 03:00:44.424]  And I said, yeah, yeah, I was working late last night.
[03:00:45.306 --> 03:00:47.428]  So we literally, my hair's not even combed.
[03:00:47.468 --> 03:00:48.269]  I was like a zombie.
[03:00:48.310 --> 03:00:49.111]  I just sat down.
[03:00:49.131 --> 03:00:50.673]  It was like nine in the morning.
[03:00:50.713 --> 03:00:51.894]  I barely had a cup of coffee.
[03:00:52.695 --> 03:00:55.679]  And he shoots the video and it's the video they shot.
[03:00:56.707 --> 03:01:01.289]  And this is really what happened, but we're going to do it again later in this hour.
[03:01:01.710 --> 03:01:02.750]  Millie Weaver's coming up too.
[03:01:03.250 --> 03:01:07.212]  I'm going to, my bags aren't as bad today, but you can see kind of some of the black circles.
[03:01:07.533 --> 03:01:09.354]  That's just cartilage damage permanently.
[03:01:10.354 --> 03:01:12.795]  But I'm lucky I can see as much stuff and punch the face.
[03:01:13.216 --> 03:01:16.317]  But we're going to zoom in later, maybe bring a camera in.
[03:01:16.337 --> 03:01:18.798]  I wasn't planning this and do it live on air.
[03:01:19.639 --> 03:01:21.460]  To some folks I've seen on YouTube go,
[03:01:22.858 --> 03:01:26.695]  But the other demonstrations you guys do, you go, that's not real, that's fake, that's not real.
[03:01:26.715 --> 03:01:27.218]  Well, you know what?
[03:01:28.257 --> 03:01:32.538]  We'll do it at, say, 25 after this hour, the last five minutes of that segment.
[03:01:32.879 --> 03:01:40.241]  I'm going to, whatever camera, because we have these cameras that don't have lenses that zoom in because they're HD, but we can get a camera maybe closer to my face so they can see it.
[03:01:40.601 --> 03:01:41.901]  We're going to do it live on air.
[03:01:42.282 --> 03:01:46.163]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to the video from a few weeks ago of me in the morning.
[03:01:46.183 --> 03:01:47.783]  You'll see my hair's not even combed on the side.
[03:01:48.784 --> 03:01:54.846]  And I'd say I got rid of 80%, at least, of the bags under my eyes, which is incredible.
[03:01:54.886 --> 03:01:55.166]  Here it is.
[03:01:55.986 --> 03:02:04.009]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:02:04.450 --> 03:02:09.371]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[03:02:09.812 --> 03:02:14.133]  Mold's been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets, and that makes me get puffy.
[03:02:16.360 --> 03:02:27.803]  If I use just one little container of Ageless, and I can share it with both eyes, within three minutes you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:02:27.823 --> 03:02:31.944]  Because I've got some bad bags with allergies, plus I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[03:02:32.244 --> 03:02:35.125]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[03:02:35.525 --> 03:02:36.685]  So, again, just twist it off.
[03:02:38.679 --> 03:02:41.740]  Even, you know, a dummy like me can put under.
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:56.144]  I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that, but when it comes to having bags under your eyes and being on television or just, you know, anybody in regular life, there's something good to do.
[03:02:56.764 --> 03:02:59.345]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[03:03:00.686 --> 03:03:03.366]  I have found that the other times I've used it,
[03:03:06.493 --> 03:03:08.413]  I don't even need to use an entire container.
[03:03:08.973 --> 03:03:09.494]  So there you go.
[03:03:09.574 --> 03:03:11.514]  I'm not a cosmetic person.
[03:03:11.634 --> 03:03:14.634]  I'm not an expert on skin, any of that stuff.
[03:03:15.015 --> 03:03:18.555]  All I know is over the years I've tried some other products that haven't done anything.
[03:03:18.575 --> 03:03:20.115]  Angelus has a massive effect.
[03:03:20.616 --> 03:03:25.056]  So you get a great product for yourself, for your wife, for your boyfriend, for your girlfriend.
[03:03:25.396 --> 03:03:26.357]  It's good for men and women.
[03:03:27.057 --> 03:03:30.997]  And you fund the InfoWars at infowarsyes.com.
[03:03:31.037 --> 03:03:33.918]  So let's see what happens in the next, I guess, two and a half minutes now.
[03:03:35.310 --> 03:03:36.152]  I'm a human being.
[03:03:36.272 --> 03:03:37.034]  I have dignity.
[03:03:37.054 --> 03:03:37.997]  I'm gonna resist.
[03:03:38.077 --> 03:03:40.443]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[03:03:40.623 --> 03:03:41.906]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[03:03:41.946 --> 03:03:43.310]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[03:03:53.723 --> 03:03:54.364]  So there you go.
[03:03:55.225 --> 03:03:59.670]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would, not as good as a woman or somebody that's, you know, good at this stuff.
[03:04:00.171 --> 03:04:01.352]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[03:04:01.392 --> 03:04:02.413]  It already feels good.
[03:04:02.433 --> 03:04:03.434]  It feels cool.
[03:04:04.335 --> 03:04:05.577]  It's pretty much dry now.
[03:04:05.657 --> 03:04:10.423]  And I'll go back, look at the time lapse, and it's pretty dramatic, at least in the past when I've done it.
[03:04:10.443 --> 03:04:11.264]  We'll see what happens here.
[03:04:11.924 --> 03:04:18.146]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy.
[03:04:18.226 --> 03:04:21.467]  It's all amazing cutting-edge at InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:04:21.987 --> 03:04:24.428]  When you get the Jeunesse products there, you get big discounts.
[03:04:24.888 --> 03:04:25.908]  There's a lot of different specials.

[03:04:35.211 --> 03:04:36.152]  Awards are expensive.
[03:04:36.212 --> 03:04:36.913]  We're fighting one.
[03:04:37.233 --> 03:04:37.733]  We're winning.
[03:04:37.813 --> 03:04:38.734]  Thanks for your support.

[03:04:59.903 --> 03:05:00.163]  Go ahead.
[03:05:00.423 --> 03:05:05.987]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:05:06.007 --> 03:05:07.287]  I had done The War Room.
[03:05:07.588 --> 03:05:10.049]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:05:10.069 --> 03:05:11.630]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:12.350]  I was exhausted.
[03:05:12.610 --> 03:05:15.892]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[03:05:16.233 --> 03:05:20.875]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:05:20.955 --> 03:05:22.977]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:05:23.037 --> 03:05:23.537]  The same thing.
[03:05:23.697 --> 03:05:25.778]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at Infowars.
[03:05:25.898 --> 03:05:27.119]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:05:27.259 --> 03:05:29.381]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:05:29.401 --> 03:05:35.405]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[03:05:35.685 --> 03:05:36.526]  You can sleep with it.
[03:05:36.846 --> 03:05:41.149]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:05:41.209 --> 03:05:43.991]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:05:44.151 --> 03:05:45.852]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:05:45.872 --> 03:05:46.672]  It really works.
[03:05:46.892 --> 03:05:51.436]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[03:05:53.677 --> 03:06:06.741]  Believe me.
[03:06:07.561 --> 03:06:10.302]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[03:06:11.162 --> 03:06:12.843]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:17.582]  Okay, I didn't plan this today.
[03:06:18.683 --> 03:06:21.765]  Jeff Conrad in here from Ginesh with InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:06:22.125 --> 03:06:23.146]  This was set up a few weeks ago.
[03:06:23.226 --> 03:06:27.210]  I didn't plan to launch this emergency super sale today and then do a rare.
[03:06:27.230 --> 03:06:30.232]  I mean we're talking maybe every two, three months I have a guest in for 30 minutes.
[03:06:30.772 --> 03:06:32.694]  Talk about a product or something we're doing if it really excites me.
[03:06:32.714 --> 03:06:34.716]  But he's in there for a full hour because
[03:06:36.057 --> 03:06:39.339]  You see it all over the news.
[03:06:39.419 --> 03:06:40.620]  I mean, they're trying to shut us down.
[03:06:40.981 --> 03:06:50.288]  The editor of Breitbart points out that Alex Jones is patient zero to end free speech and that Alex Jones is being banned because he's telling the truth and is exciting and popular.
[03:06:51.169 --> 03:06:51.629]  So what do they do?
[03:06:51.689 --> 03:06:53.871]  They build a straw man of things I never said or did.
[03:06:54.451 --> 03:06:55.392]  I'm a Nazi.
[03:06:55.632 --> 03:06:56.433]  All this other crap.
[03:06:57.073 --> 03:06:58.675]  And then they want me banned.
[03:06:59.648 --> 03:07:01.649]  So, this is how we fund ourselves.
[03:07:01.669 --> 03:07:02.130]  Free Market.
[03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:05.312]  If you're listening to local radio station, become a sponsor.
[03:07:05.392 --> 03:07:06.232]  Thank the sponsors.
[03:07:06.693 --> 03:07:07.853]  Send the station $100.
[03:07:07.973 --> 03:07:11.896]  They are just as important as I am in the whole chain of fighting the globalists.
[03:07:12.536 --> 03:07:13.157]  Now, Conrad...
[03:07:14.301 --> 03:07:30.673]  I want to continue, and we're going to do it on air, with the bags, next segment, where I'm going to put on, I mean, I know one little tube does both eyes, I did like half a tube with my eyes, we showed it earlier, but I'm going to do it live on air, because some people didn't believe what they saw, because it was so amazing.
[03:07:31.113 --> 03:07:32.854]  We're on air, it's 2-0-7 Central.
[03:07:33.715 --> 03:07:38.816]  At like 225 Central, I'm going to apply it with a camera on my ugly face up close, sorry.
[03:07:38.836 --> 03:07:40.196]  You're going to see it for yourself.
[03:07:41.196 --> 03:07:42.717]  And so it is extremely dramatic.
[03:07:43.097 --> 03:07:44.197]  So that is coming up.
[03:07:45.317 --> 03:07:46.337]  I want to take calls though.
[03:07:46.357 --> 03:07:56.499]  We got Alex and Tom and Pastor Sam and Nate and Alex and George and Brandon in California and Indiana and Julie and Adam and Denae and Robert.
[03:07:57.259 --> 03:07:58.299]  And we got Millie Weaver coming up.
[03:07:58.319 --> 03:07:59.480]  But I'll get to all your calls.
[03:07:59.640 --> 03:08:01.000]  And I'm hosting the fourth hour.
[03:08:02.188 --> 03:08:06.073]  And I'm hosting the fourth hour, ladies and gentlemen, which we're now into here today.
[03:08:06.093 --> 03:08:07.375]  And then the war room's coming up after that.
[03:08:07.896 --> 03:08:09.939]  But I do want to take some phone calls right now, because here's the deal.
[03:08:10.814 --> 03:08:17.856]  You know, Conrad, you're a smart guy, I've gotten to know you, but let me guess, you're just more of a pragmatic, common sense, what, like, libertarian?
[03:08:17.916 --> 03:08:19.297]  I wouldn't even say Republican, Democrat.
[03:08:19.317 --> 03:08:21.857]  I know you like Trump, but it's kind of dangerous to even say that.
[03:08:23.018 --> 03:08:28.940]  But the fact that Jeunesse wants me to be a spokesperson, they're a great big multi-billion dollar company, you know, a billion dollars every year.
[03:08:28.960 --> 03:08:31.340]  I like the fact that you're not cowards on top of it.
[03:08:31.460 --> 03:08:36.582]  Yeah, well, you know, if you were to ask me, you know, what I'm all about, it's really entrepreneurship.
[03:08:37.601 --> 03:08:49.325]  I'm an entrepreneur and I, you know, like you're an entrepreneur and, you know, the thing about, the thing about the, the opportunity, the, the Jeunesse opportunity for most people though is that it really empowers people to go out there and be an entrepreneur.
[03:08:49.846 --> 03:08:56.188]  That's what I love about it more than anything else is it teaches a person to say, look, if you want something to happen, don't count on the government, don't count on anybody else.
[03:08:56.648 --> 03:09:00.950]  Don't, don't think that your degree is going to make it all happen for you because there's a lot more to it than that.
[03:09:00.990 --> 03:09:04.591]  And that's what I love about the model is the model has been proven over a hundred years
[03:09:05.231 --> 03:09:14.616]  To be able to go out there and empower people who really want to be an entrepreneur but they don't have six figures or they don't have a rich parent or whatever the case may be to get into entrepreneurship.
[03:09:14.696 --> 03:09:16.637]  So this is literally a bootstrap operation.
[03:09:16.917 --> 03:09:17.337]  Absolutely.
[03:09:17.357 --> 03:09:18.097]  But it's one that works.
[03:09:18.378 --> 03:09:22.760]  It's one that works because the thing about it is who wants to get involved with something that doesn't work?
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:24.902]  You know, the thing about this is, this does work.
[03:09:24.922 --> 03:09:27.605]  No, if I was going to sell cars, I want to sell whatever the hottest and best was.
[03:09:27.685 --> 03:09:28.406]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:09:28.426 --> 03:09:29.307]  The one that sells themselves.
[03:09:29.407 --> 03:09:34.212]  Yeah, and the great part about it is, if you look at the richest people in the world, they have global businesses.
[03:09:34.673 --> 03:09:36.274]  They don't have businesses that are just in one area.
[03:09:36.294 --> 03:09:36.735]  No, and I agree.
[03:09:36.775 --> 03:09:37.816]  Let me ask you, you've got the network.
[03:09:37.836 --> 03:09:38.497]  Let me ask this question.
[03:09:39.770 --> 03:09:59.772]  Why, with the economy at 4.8% growth, and everything turning around, why can they get so many people, particularly college students, you talked about this last time we were going to calls, I look at it, they were talking about white patriarchy and all this crap, when I watch these videos that our crew shot live this week with Kavanaugh's confirmation, and they're like almost all white!
[03:10:00.373 --> 03:10:01.575]  And they're almost all white women.
[03:10:01.615 --> 03:10:03.116]  And my mom's a white woman.
[03:10:03.136 --> 03:10:03.737]  My wife's a white woman.
[03:10:03.757 --> 03:10:04.518]  I love white people.
[03:10:04.538 --> 03:10:09.304]  My daughters... I'm not against white people, but it's like white people going, racist patriarchy!
[03:10:09.344 --> 03:10:10.025]  Racist whites!
[03:10:10.245 --> 03:10:10.786]  Whites rule!
[03:10:10.826 --> 03:10:11.286]  Racism!
[03:10:11.487 --> 03:10:12.388]  America sucks!
[03:10:12.688 --> 03:10:14.270]  But everybody's trying to get into America.
[03:10:14.290 --> 03:10:17.094]  It doesn't mean America's perfect, but the idea's great.
[03:10:17.154 --> 03:10:18.195]  And what is it about college?
[03:10:18.215 --> 03:10:18.575]  Well, I know.
[03:10:20.015 --> 03:10:20.895]  9% of degrees are worthless.
[03:10:20.915 --> 03:10:21.776]  You'll never pay them back.
[03:10:22.096 --> 03:10:23.156]  You'll end up bagging groceries.
[03:10:23.196 --> 03:10:23.656]  I'm sorry.
[03:10:23.936 --> 03:10:27.538]  And then they got a chip on their shoulder thinking, oh, we didn't take over.
[03:10:27.598 --> 03:10:28.838]  The socialism didn't take over.
[03:10:29.218 --> 03:10:31.779]  If we take over, then my degree will be worth something.
[03:10:32.059 --> 03:10:40.702]  It's like folks that buy into the Nigerian phone scams or, you know, the scams they do with their saving, you know, sex traffic women or whatever it is.
[03:10:41.696 --> 03:10:46.918]  And once people have already invested $5,000, they don't want to admit they got scammed that it's $100,000.
[03:10:46.958 --> 03:10:48.919]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[03:10:48.939 --> 03:10:52.600]  The left has like invested in the ultimate socialist Ponzi scheme.
[03:10:53.040 --> 03:10:56.622]  Yeah, well the problem is that everybody's taught to live in a box.
[03:10:57.262 --> 03:11:02.906]  The reason people want to come to the United States of America is because they know there's no limitations on living in a box.
[03:11:03.186 --> 03:11:14.154]  And so what's great about this business model is that it allows a person to be able to say, you know what, I want to be an entrepreneur and I can go into and be involved with a company that's proven they supply everything for me.
[03:11:14.174 --> 03:11:15.755]  I don't have to... Well, that's why it's so good.
[03:11:15.895 --> 03:11:17.657]  Almost all women have heard of this eye cream.
[03:11:19.020 --> 03:11:20.502]  But they don't take the action to go get it.
[03:11:20.642 --> 03:11:23.606]  If you've got it, you can sign folks up like hotcakes for the eye cream.
[03:11:23.886 --> 03:11:25.388]  I just personally think the eye cream is the way to go.
[03:11:25.408 --> 03:11:27.271]  Let me tell you right now.
[03:11:28.706 --> 03:11:32.567]  If I was in college or whatever, I could go shell every female I know and then get them to shell it.
[03:11:32.807 --> 03:11:33.788]  And that's the MLM level.
[03:11:34.248 --> 03:11:35.809]  You're getting them to then sell the women they know.
[03:11:36.029 --> 03:11:36.209]  Right.
[03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:37.869]  Just the eye cream alone is dynamite.
[03:11:37.929 --> 03:11:39.710]  Well, the new economy is word of mouth, Alex.
[03:11:39.730 --> 03:11:41.390]  That's the thing about it is that most people don't realize.
[03:11:41.410 --> 03:11:42.131]  The internet's burnt out.
[03:11:42.151 --> 03:11:43.151]  Yeah, the internet's burnt out.
[03:11:43.551 --> 03:11:48.353]  The most powerful form of marketing today is somebody saying, hey, I like this and you should check it out.
[03:11:48.473 --> 03:11:50.013]  Or I like that and you should check it out.
[03:11:50.033 --> 03:11:55.295]  I mean, when was the last time you recommended something and you didn't get paid for it, like a movie or something?
[03:11:55.315 --> 03:11:56.136]  Hey, go watch this movie.
[03:11:56.156 --> 03:11:56.636]  Did you get paid?
[03:11:57.256 --> 03:11:57.797]  Go read this book.
[03:11:57.817 --> 03:11:58.717]  And that's the number one thing.
[03:11:58.757 --> 03:12:01.500]  I don't go off reviews because they admit Rotten Tomatoes is bought up and fake now.
[03:12:01.540 --> 03:12:04.602]  I literally call people I know and say, have you seen movies lately?
[03:12:04.882 --> 03:12:07.024]  The reviews are all, this one sucks, that one's good.
[03:12:07.364 --> 03:12:08.485]  I call people.
[03:12:08.705 --> 03:12:08.866]  Right.
[03:12:08.886 --> 03:12:10.327]  Because I won't go off reviews now.
[03:12:10.487 --> 03:12:10.707]  Yeah.
[03:12:10.827 --> 03:12:11.007]  Yeah.
[03:12:11.047 --> 03:12:12.989]  Well, those reviews only went bad the last five years.
[03:12:13.189 --> 03:12:13.409]  Right.
[03:12:13.569 --> 03:12:13.770]  Right.
[03:12:13.810 --> 03:12:14.330]  Have you noticed?
[03:12:14.350 --> 03:12:14.430]  Yeah.
[03:12:14.670 --> 03:12:15.571]  Yeah, I have.
[03:12:15.671 --> 03:12:17.012]  I mean, you have to call people.
[03:12:17.112 --> 03:12:17.953]  You have to call people.
[03:12:18.333 --> 03:12:21.136]  I mean, the thing about the thing about any product that's out there.
[03:12:21.156 --> 03:12:23.297]  OK, so like it's like it's like with this product right here.
[03:12:23.337 --> 03:12:23.437]  OK.
[03:12:24.558 --> 03:12:25.338]  It's pretty simple.
[03:12:25.418 --> 03:12:26.719]  You drink it, you get energy.
[03:12:26.839 --> 03:12:27.899]  It's not real complicated.
[03:12:27.959 --> 03:12:31.140]  So if you go out there and you like a product, you tell somebody about it.
[03:12:31.180 --> 03:12:33.081]  See, celebrities and athletes have been doing this forever.
[03:12:33.861 --> 03:12:35.702]  But they get paid for it, right?
[03:12:36.282 --> 03:12:38.463]  Here, you get paid for it, and then Geneste pays you.
[03:12:38.483 --> 03:12:39.163]  Let's expand on that.
[03:12:39.623 --> 03:12:41.284]  So many of these other supplement companies
[03:12:42.520 --> 03:12:46.564]  They mark stuff up seven times, they put crap in it, and it's all marketing, and it's... No.
[03:12:46.904 --> 03:12:51.408]  I happen to know, you guys, like, half the cost is literally the... That's what I like, is it's really good.
[03:12:52.369 --> 03:12:54.370]  People go, why would you want to sell something really good?
[03:12:54.450 --> 03:12:55.571]  They just think people are idiots.
[03:12:55.972 --> 03:12:58.694]  They think they want the marketing instead of the quality ingredients.
[03:12:58.854 --> 03:12:59.335]  Well, they do.
[03:13:00.095 --> 03:13:00.376]  They do.
[03:13:00.416 --> 03:13:02.858]  The key is that you have to have products that people want to rebuy.
[03:13:02.878 --> 03:13:06.201]  I know, so then why are most supplements marked up seven times in crap?
[03:13:07.152 --> 03:13:10.497]  Because what happens is people go out and they market it, market it, market it.
[03:13:10.517 --> 03:13:12.920]  Because the corporate dudes are real, you know what?
[03:13:13.320 --> 03:13:13.761]  Yeah, they are.
[03:13:13.881 --> 03:13:14.121]  They are.
[03:13:14.402 --> 03:13:16.404]  Or they'll get a celebrity who doesn't even use the product.
[03:13:16.865 --> 03:13:17.646]  There's products out there.
[03:13:17.666 --> 03:13:18.307]  No, that's what I'm saying.
[03:13:18.347 --> 03:13:22.352]  They spend it all on the advertising and the celebrity instead of like knocking your socks off.
[03:13:22.452 --> 03:13:23.133]  Right, exactly.
[03:13:23.393 --> 03:13:32.322]  When people see the bags underneath Alex go away within just two minutes or less, how can that... I mean, you're going to see this live, by the way, okay?
[03:13:32.462 --> 03:13:33.162]  You get what I'm saying?
[03:13:33.182 --> 03:13:37.447]  You're seeing something work first-hand, then you're going to go buy it, and then that's the key part.
[03:13:37.467 --> 03:13:39.268]  And then George Soros can go fly a kite.
[03:13:39.989 --> 03:13:43.071]  Because we're going to still be on the air and be funded selling stuff that works like hotcakes.
[03:13:43.151 --> 03:13:46.092]  Well, I still think we should send maybe George Soros a whole pallet of this.
[03:13:46.272 --> 03:13:50.234]  You know, that'd be a good stunt to mail this to him because he's got the biggest bags I've ever seen.
[03:13:50.254 --> 03:13:52.376]  He does, and he needs about a whole pallet of this stuff.
[03:13:52.396 --> 03:13:54.777]  I'm going to be honest, he looks like he has two scrotums under his eyes.
[03:13:55.777 --> 03:13:56.958]  Sorry, I'm being mean.
[03:13:57.298 --> 03:13:58.739]  Let's go to Alex in Minnesota.
[03:13:58.779 --> 03:13:59.539]  Alex, thanks for holding.
[03:14:00.039 --> 03:14:03.001]  What do you think the Democrats and the Globalists are going to pull?
[03:14:03.341 --> 03:14:06.043]  They say they're going to go completely ape now that Kavanaugh has been confirmed.
[03:14:06.063 --> 03:14:06.503]  What do you think?
[03:14:08.314 --> 03:14:16.220]  Well, Alex, yeah, I mean, I've even seen it firsthand in my home state of Minnesota, which unfortunately is a pretty liberal place if you're in the metro.
[03:14:17.161 --> 03:14:19.562]  But, you know, I started listening to you in 2016.
[03:14:19.642 --> 03:14:25.787]  I know a lot of other people did around that time, too, because, you know, you give an angle that you're just not going to hear in the mainstream media.
[03:14:25.807 --> 03:14:30.250]  So that's why I wanted to ask you, you know, what do you think is going to happen during the midterms?
[03:14:30.330 --> 03:14:32.732]  Because I know, you know, if you go to any of the typical polls,
[03:14:33.499 --> 03:14:36.401]  They say it's gloom and doom, it's game over for the Liberty Movement.
[03:14:36.501 --> 03:14:41.384]  But, you know, in 2016 we saw the exact opposite of their narrative come true.
[03:14:41.484 --> 03:14:43.906]  So, what do you think is going to happen and where do we go from here?
[03:14:43.926 --> 03:14:48.149]  Well, I saw a headline two days ago on CNN saying, believe the polls.
[03:14:49.355 --> 03:14:53.097]  And I know, I didn't just say Trump was going to win because I magically thought that.
[03:14:53.137 --> 03:14:56.638]  I said, there's a huge wave of election fraud coming, which is confirmed.
[03:14:56.658 --> 03:15:06.523]  And there's a huge wave of populist sentiment, just like the Donald Trump they tried to kill of Brazil just won the first round by a huge margin.
[03:15:07.343 --> 03:15:15.927]  And just like all the world, populists are being elected from Germany, to Sweden, to Greece, to areas of Asia, to Africa, to Latin America.
[03:15:15.967 --> 03:15:17.127]  So you've got that.
[03:15:18.652 --> 03:15:23.758]  They add 10 to 15 to 20 points being on the poll, oversampling of Democrats, claiming, oh, there are more Democrats.
[03:15:24.199 --> 03:15:24.900]  So that's skewed.
[03:15:24.920 --> 03:15:30.887]  So saying in polls in battleground states that Republicans are five points behind, well, that means Republicans are 10 points ahead.
[03:15:31.267 --> 03:15:33.870]  But you add election fraud in, I'd say it's a dead heat.
[03:15:34.711 --> 03:15:38.756]  And I think them being so bullying during Kavanaugh is going to backfire.
[03:15:38.836 --> 03:15:41.098]  And I believe they're going to barely hold the House.
[03:15:41.639 --> 03:15:45.403]  And I believe they're going to hold the Senate if we stay the course.
[03:15:45.423 --> 03:15:46.944]  There may be a false flag that changes that.
[03:15:46.964 --> 03:15:50.628]  But right now, I am predicting a red wave goes over the blue seawall.
[03:15:50.969 --> 03:15:51.669]  Stay there, Alex.
[03:15:51.689 --> 03:15:52.891]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[03:15:56.331 --> 03:15:59.053]  Tim Cook is the most evil man in the world.
[03:15:59.113 --> 03:16:02.836]  He's certainly the most dangerous, and I'm gonna show you the proof here, right now.
[03:16:03.197 --> 03:16:05.259]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[03:16:05.699 --> 03:16:10.383]  What users want from us, and what we've always provided them, is a curated file.
[03:16:11.618 --> 03:16:16.325]  We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.
[03:16:16.846 --> 03:16:20.210]  Someone that does review the podcast.
[03:16:20.871 --> 03:16:26.600]  Someone that, on like Apple News, where a human is selecting the top stories.
[03:16:27.160 --> 03:16:27.962]  And that's what we do.
[03:16:29.178 --> 03:16:30.959]  We don't take a political stand.
[03:16:31.019 --> 03:16:33.081]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[03:16:33.361 --> 03:16:38.305]  You can tell that from the stuff on the App Store and in podcasts, etc.
[03:16:38.585 --> 03:16:42.128]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[03:16:42.688 --> 03:16:44.530]  And that's the way I think it should be.
[03:16:44.650 --> 03:16:46.751]  But at what point were you like, OK, that's it.
[03:16:46.891 --> 03:16:48.352]  Alex Jones has to go.
[03:16:48.493 --> 03:16:51.094]  You know, we get into a singular kind of event.
[03:16:51.415 --> 03:16:53.756]  But I think there's enough there.
[03:16:54.717 --> 03:17:01.759]  That reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[03:17:01.899 --> 03:17:05.080]  I think there's enough there that we had to curate.
[03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:07.281]  You know, Hitler saw himself as a curator.
[03:17:07.301 --> 03:17:11.742]  He wanted Berlin to be this big museum city with these big massive structures.
[03:17:12.563 --> 03:17:19.785]  And then they called Albert Speer, his head of domestic operations, the curator and the master architect.
[03:17:20.845 --> 03:17:26.027]  And so when you hear stuff like, oh, we're curating, we're ordering your life because we know best, wow.
[03:17:26.307 --> 03:17:29.528]  Did you coordinate with other tech companies to kick off Alex Jones?
[03:17:29.548 --> 03:17:29.748]  No.
[03:17:30.528 --> 03:17:33.809]  I've never even had a conversation about this with an exact company.
[03:17:33.850 --> 03:17:35.250]  Why not?
[03:17:35.310 --> 03:17:35.970]  But why?
[03:17:36.831 --> 03:17:38.011]  This is a huge thing.
[03:17:39.091 --> 03:17:40.752]  We make our decisions independently.
[03:17:41.508 --> 03:17:42.729]  And I think that's important.
[03:17:43.249 --> 03:17:47.593]  Honestly, I've had no conversation, and to my knowledge, no one in Apple has.
[03:17:48.073 --> 03:17:50.875]  Tim Cook had already moved to China five years ago.
[03:17:51.175 --> 03:17:52.516]  The CEO of Apple.
[03:17:52.576 --> 03:17:57.980]  Tim Cook, seven months ago, officially became state-run to get total tax exemption.
[03:17:58.021 --> 03:18:00.262]  Yeah, Trump's bad for lowering it to 15 if you live in the U.S.
[03:18:00.302 --> 03:18:01.623]  China goes to zero to counter that.
[03:18:01.663 --> 03:18:08.408]  When they went to zero, he said, he was quoted in Reuters saying, when you're in China and you partner, the government runs you.
[03:18:08.568 --> 03:18:08.689]  Now,
[03:18:09.489 --> 03:18:10.269]  You think about that.
[03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:13.910]  China has killed five times what Hitler did of its own people.
[03:18:14.050 --> 03:18:16.111]  You don't hear a word, not one Hollywood movie about it, nothing.
[03:18:16.391 --> 03:18:17.552]  Because China owns Hollywood.
[03:18:18.192 --> 03:18:21.013]  Our elites positioned China for the takedown of America.
[03:18:21.273 --> 03:18:22.433]  It's a corporate takeover.
[03:18:22.853 --> 03:18:23.613]  This is high treason.
[03:18:23.914 --> 03:18:25.334]  Trump is trying to stop this.
[03:18:25.834 --> 03:18:28.155]  But Tim Cook goes in there and lies to his face.
[03:18:29.164 --> 03:18:30.285]  We've got solutions as well.
[03:18:30.746 --> 03:18:35.471]  When I started going after Tim Cook, that's when I got deplatformed, and he bragged that he let it.
[03:18:35.571 --> 03:18:37.674]  But that's why he's now denying.
[03:18:37.834 --> 03:18:41.378]  Oh, I didn't work with any other companies, even though he bragged about it in Apple and Saturday.
[03:18:41.498 --> 03:18:47.045]  And it said, with one hour of Tim Cook in his Sunday night meeting with Zuckerberg and others, they made the decision and followed suit.
[03:18:47.225 --> 03:18:49.007]  But now he says he never did it.
[03:18:49.167 --> 03:18:50.548]  Forget about Alex Jones.
[03:18:50.828 --> 03:18:52.249]  He knows it's racketeering.
[03:18:52.409 --> 03:18:55.752]  He knows that he worked with other companies and that's what's illegal.
[03:18:55.812 --> 03:18:57.013]  That's Sherman Antitrust.
[03:18:57.133 --> 03:18:58.214]  That's a combine.
[03:18:58.354 --> 03:18:59.595]  That's a cartel.
[03:18:59.815 --> 03:19:00.976]  That is 100% illegal.
[03:19:01.016 --> 03:19:02.557]  There's another one.
[03:19:02.737 --> 03:19:06.520]  Tim Cook says Apple had to comply with Chinese censors and they did do it.
[03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:07.721]  And they'll do it in the U.S.
[03:19:07.761 --> 03:19:08.221]  too.
[03:19:08.361 --> 03:19:13.305]  Apple's CEO backs China's vision of an open internet as censorship reaches new heights.
[03:19:13.585 --> 03:19:14.065]  I love this.
[03:19:14.465 --> 03:19:16.327]  They call it open internet censorship.
[03:19:16.587 --> 03:19:19.209]  Tim Cook says it's a worldwide censorship, Xi.
[03:19:19.409 --> 03:19:20.891]  That with open means they run it all.
[03:19:21.091 --> 03:19:23.813]  Chinese spy chips are found in hardware used by Apple.
[03:19:23.913 --> 03:19:26.195]  Amazon Bloomberg says they're breaking into the military.
[03:19:26.215 --> 03:19:28.918]  Our governments steal everything and Apple helped them do it.
[03:19:28.998 --> 03:19:30.099]  Apple's the main group.
[03:19:30.219 --> 03:19:31.280]  Can we go back to his eyes?
[03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:32.841]  What's up with that dude's eyes?
[03:19:32.861 --> 03:19:37.065]  Imagine if I was on TV and my pupils were like 90% like I was an owl.
[03:19:37.305 --> 03:19:37.465]  I mean,
[03:19:37.765 --> 03:19:40.926]  Whoa, dude, you've got like 90% pupil.
[03:19:41.107 --> 03:19:43.528]  Whoa, what's going on there, bro?
[03:19:43.668 --> 03:19:44.508]  What you taking?
[03:19:44.668 --> 03:19:46.149]  Must be some pretty good stuff.
[03:19:46.249 --> 03:19:53.032]  Last time I ever saw pupils that big, the police were arresting one of my neighbors in high school because he took too many hits LSD.
[03:19:59.675 --> 03:20:02.276]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.980 --> 03:20:20.462]  Conrad the Constitution, Badilla's our guest with M4sYes.com.
[03:20:20.482 --> 03:20:32.951]  I'm gonna go back to your calls here in just a moment and then live on air I'm gonna put some of this great product from Jeunesse, Instantly Ageless, on my metrosexual bags.
[03:20:34.612 --> 03:20:35.433]  If you leave me.
[03:20:35.453 --> 03:20:38.054]  Alright, we're gonna go ahead and go back to your calls.
[03:20:38.175 --> 03:20:40.016]  Alex, you were asking some serious questions though.
[03:20:41.539 --> 03:20:51.268]  I don't just get up here and cheerlead that I think Trump was going to win 20 months ago, or I thought that he would actually do good on TPP and all this.
[03:20:51.448 --> 03:20:56.233]  I knew by what they were doing and how angry they were, and by who was behind Trump, that he was for real.
[03:20:56.773 --> 03:21:04.140]  Doesn't mean he's perfect, doesn't mean the Pentagon and the Patriots and some of the corporations and the American people are perfect, but we want to run our own country.
[03:21:05.427 --> 03:21:09.891]  And Trump represents that insurgency to take our government back and our country back.
[03:21:10.591 --> 03:21:12.913]  And so that's why those that are fighting against it are traitors.
[03:21:12.973 --> 03:21:22.160]  And now, 20 months later, 21 months almost, because it is 21 months, he's saying 21 months later, we are so close with the economy coming back from the dead.
[03:21:22.501 --> 03:21:23.822]  That's what frightens the globalists.
[03:21:23.842 --> 03:21:25.823]  So my prediction is
[03:21:26.940 --> 03:21:32.842]  They have a four to five point lead, CNN and others tell us, in all of these battleground states.
[03:21:33.762 --> 03:21:43.425]  And that shows they don't want it to be as ridiculous as two years ago, where they're like, 98% chance scientific algorithm, Hillary wins, and all the rest of that garbage.
[03:21:44.885 --> 03:21:46.946]  So now they're just saying, oh, there's a five point lead.
[03:21:47.737 --> 03:21:50.938]  Okay, well then, they're sampling more Democrats than Republicans, it evens out.
[03:21:51.338 --> 03:22:01.341]  I think it's up to all of us to get everyone we know to go vote for sure, and to not, you know, vote twice as the Democrats do, but to really just get the word out and stand up against this bullying.
[03:22:01.361 --> 03:22:02.501]  What do you think is going to happen, Alex?
[03:22:04.442 --> 03:22:09.543]  Well, I think we really can win, but I think it's going to have to be a grassroots movement, just like it was in 2016.
[03:22:09.663 --> 03:22:16.045]  And, you know, I think the best thing for us to do is to just shut off the corporate media and turn to people like you.
[03:22:16.860 --> 03:22:18.780]  And I think that's why you've become so popular.
[03:22:18.800 --> 03:22:22.241]  You know, I heard about you just by word of mouth from a friend of mine.
[03:22:22.261 --> 03:22:23.141]  And he said, you know what?
[03:22:23.561 --> 03:22:27.762]  This is somebody who's not essentially just a puppet for huge corporate sponsors.
[03:22:27.822 --> 03:22:29.443]  And I think you've really been leading the charge.
[03:22:29.503 --> 03:22:34.864]  So, yeah, what we need to do is just get out and vote and tell other people about the program and just stay strong.
[03:22:35.604 --> 03:22:36.384]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:22:36.444 --> 03:22:37.004]  Let me say this.
[03:22:37.624 --> 03:22:40.045]  I'm all for corporations and free market and profit.
[03:22:40.445 --> 03:22:44.646]  But these big corporations get together, they create a consensus, and the voter they see is an enemy.
[03:22:45.646 --> 03:22:48.129]  They've all made even more money under Trump, but they still hate him.
[03:22:48.449 --> 03:22:49.731]  Because they want the power.
[03:22:50.091 --> 03:22:50.271]  Yeah.
[03:22:50.712 --> 03:22:51.733]  You got any comments on that, Conrad?
[03:22:52.214 --> 03:22:52.774]  Yeah, they do.
[03:22:52.814 --> 03:22:56.178]  They want the power, but they also want everybody to live in their boxes.
[03:22:56.399 --> 03:22:57.360]  And I think that's the thing.
[03:22:57.820 --> 03:23:01.745]  I think if you were to ask me about Trump, why has he done so well, and why are people
[03:23:02.365 --> 03:23:02.726]  I don't think so.
[03:23:18.263 --> 03:23:31.251]  That if he hadn't delivered, he'd be in trouble, but he's delivered now, and people get like, the whole establishment we're sick of, and Bill and Hillary Clinton, they're all telling us we're bad, but, I mean, I think they've really pushed too far.
[03:23:31.491 --> 03:23:34.293]  Yeah, well, they pushed too far, and people are smarter now.
[03:23:34.853 --> 03:23:37.696]  See, people are tired of being tired, and they're like, you know what?
[03:23:38.097 --> 03:23:43.863]  You guys aren't delivering in Washington anymore, and so you guys don't do what you say you're going to do.
[03:23:43.943 --> 03:23:48.308]  And so what they're doing is, they're all flocking to Trump now, because Trump is delivering.
[03:23:48.328 --> 03:23:49.729]  I mean, it's amazing what he's done in two years.
[03:23:50.390 --> 03:23:50.931]  And I agree.
[03:23:51.371 --> 03:23:53.233]  What happens if they were successful to remove him?
[03:23:53.453 --> 03:23:54.334]  Have they thought about that?
[03:23:55.222 --> 03:23:56.422]  I mean, people would be pissed.
[03:23:56.883 --> 03:23:58.703]  Well, they'd be pissed, but good luck.
[03:23:59.543 --> 03:23:59.883]  Good luck.
[03:23:59.924 --> 03:24:07.266]  In my personal opinion, I think that you have more people right now that are even Democrats right now, especially after this whole mess with this Kavanaugh thing.
[03:24:07.346 --> 03:24:09.487]  I mean, they really embarrassed themselves, the Democratic Party.
[03:24:09.967 --> 03:24:15.228]  I think what they're basically going to do now is they pushed even people more to the Republican Party and the Republican Party stronger than ever.
[03:24:15.308 --> 03:24:19.630]  No, I agree, because Republicans were going to win the midterms.
[03:24:20.663 --> 03:24:22.625]  But because of election fraud, they might have lost.
[03:24:22.665 --> 03:24:24.246]  But I think real numbers, they were gonna win.
[03:24:24.527 --> 03:24:25.788]  That's the sense of the country, the numbers.
[03:24:26.308 --> 03:24:29.852]  But because of the Kavanaugh and the bullying, I think it pushed it over the edge.
[03:24:30.132 --> 03:24:31.814]  So I think narrow victory.
[03:24:32.334 --> 03:24:36.318]  Yeah, I think it's gonna be a narrow victory, but I agree with your caller.
[03:24:36.438 --> 03:24:37.579]  I completely agree, man.
[03:24:37.699 --> 03:24:39.121]  Don't listen to what a lot of the media says.
[03:24:39.361 --> 03:24:39.901]  Go vote.
[03:24:40.322 --> 03:24:41.383]  Everybody needs to go vote.
[03:24:41.423 --> 03:24:42.424]  Don't think it's a done deal.
[03:24:42.464 --> 03:24:43.805]  And spread the word about independent media.
[03:24:43.965 --> 03:24:45.426]  They have absolute independent media.
[03:24:45.806 --> 03:24:49.489]  What I agree with what you're doing, Alex, here is proof.
[03:24:49.509 --> 03:24:54.031]  It proves in the network marketing model as well, which is that word of mouth marketing works.
[03:24:54.452 --> 03:24:58.834]  Oh, they want to shut down because we're a media institution that's reached billions of people every year.
[03:24:59.275 --> 03:24:59.675]  Literally.
[03:24:59.995 --> 03:25:01.617]  That isn't funded by the big corporates.
[03:25:02.057 --> 03:25:04.899]  So if people adopt this model, it's over for them.
[03:25:05.200 --> 03:25:06.221]  We've got a few minutes to break.
[03:25:06.621 --> 03:25:07.442]  Three minutes to break.
[03:25:07.502 --> 03:25:07.742]  Boom.
[03:25:08.062 --> 03:25:08.643]  Three and a half minutes.
[03:25:08.663 --> 03:25:09.343]  Let me get this on.
[03:25:09.704 --> 03:25:11.425]  This is the amazing product at InfoWars.
[03:25:11.725 --> 03:25:12.406]  Guess.com.
[03:25:12.466 --> 03:25:13.127]  Instantly ageless.
[03:25:13.627 --> 03:25:16.810]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't even have to use a full deal of it.
[03:25:16.910 --> 03:25:19.152]  Last time I did this live, it was incredible.
[03:25:19.693 --> 03:25:20.874]  So I'm getting that on right there.
[03:25:21.674 --> 03:25:23.936]  Again, I'm not a big guy at applying stuff.
[03:25:24.477 --> 03:25:25.578]  And it's all natural.
[03:25:25.618 --> 03:25:26.479]  It gets on there and it does.
[03:25:27.443 --> 03:25:28.183]  Incredible job.
[03:25:28.844 --> 03:25:33.185]  I'll get this on, and it lasts 10 hours, and you saw what it did last time.
[03:25:33.205 --> 03:25:34.526]  I didn't even use the full tube.
[03:25:35.066 --> 03:25:36.026]  It's good for two eyes.
[03:25:37.347 --> 03:25:39.687]  Some of us have more than two eyes, but three or four.
[03:25:39.727 --> 03:25:41.948]  Yeah, so let it dry, and it'll start working.
[03:25:41.968 --> 03:25:42.769]  You think I got enough on there now?
[03:25:43.089 --> 03:25:43.969]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:25:43.989 --> 03:25:44.849]  All right, then just do this?
[03:25:45.109 --> 03:25:45.229]  Yeah.
[03:25:45.249 --> 03:25:45.790]  All right, let's start.
[03:25:45.810 --> 03:25:46.830]  We're right with three minutes to break.
[03:25:46.850 --> 03:25:47.690]  Let's do it.
[03:25:47.950 --> 03:25:49.351]  As it dries, it works.
[03:25:49.511 --> 03:25:50.411]  I declare.
[03:25:51.372 --> 03:25:52.172]  I declare.
[03:25:57.313 --> 03:25:57.833]  So there you go.
[03:25:59.073 --> 03:26:04.275]  And then after it dries, there's a little bit extra, you put a little water there, kind of wipe it off.
[03:26:04.355 --> 03:26:05.355]  It's already working.
[03:26:05.455 --> 03:26:06.575]  I'm learning how to put makeup on.
[03:26:07.676 --> 03:26:08.216]  So beautiful.
[03:26:11.077 --> 03:26:11.677]  That's a joke.
[03:26:11.697 --> 03:26:15.558]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:26:15.778 --> 03:26:16.858]  Stopwatch is going.
[03:26:17.458 --> 03:26:18.979]  We got like two and a half minutes left here.
[03:26:18.999 --> 03:26:23.380]  Again, if you're a radio listener, we're talking about
[03:26:25.017 --> 03:26:28.338]  Instantly Ageless and InfoWarsYes.com that is rated out there.
[03:26:28.378 --> 03:26:28.998]  Look it up yourself.
[03:26:29.098 --> 03:26:33.179]  The best bags under the eyes eye cream out there.
[03:26:33.219 --> 03:26:34.059]  It works amazing.
[03:26:34.099 --> 03:26:35.999]  Look, we're only a minute.
[03:26:36.159 --> 03:26:40.560]  We're 45 seconds in and unbelievable.
[03:26:42.001 --> 03:26:44.081]  I mean, do people see what I'm seeing right there?
[03:26:44.301 --> 03:26:45.582]  Yeah, especially live.
[03:26:45.622 --> 03:26:47.302]  What's great about this, people are seeing it live.
[03:26:47.422 --> 03:26:49.082]  You know, I should have put it on my crow's feet too.
[03:26:49.562 --> 03:26:50.603]  I know it does that too here.
[03:26:50.643 --> 03:26:51.263]  We don't have enough time.
[03:26:51.283 --> 03:26:51.763]  We got a break.
[03:26:51.783 --> 03:26:52.163]  Let's try it.
[03:26:53.988 --> 03:26:55.129]  I kind of like my crow's feet though.
[03:26:56.490 --> 03:26:57.931]  Yeah, it's a sign of wisdom.
[03:26:58.931 --> 03:27:00.812]  Well, let's just say the ladies don't dislike it.
[03:27:01.013 --> 03:27:02.113]  Don't think anything about that.
[03:27:02.714 --> 03:27:05.255]  Anyways, the point is, I'm going to try to get rid of my wrinkles.
[03:27:05.475 --> 03:27:06.656]  But it sure as hell works though.
[03:27:06.936 --> 03:27:09.218]  This is great for women or whoever else.
[03:27:09.238 --> 03:27:11.119]  I don't know what I'm doing anymore.
[03:27:11.139 --> 03:27:13.100]  You should see how this looks here.
[03:27:13.120 --> 03:27:15.062]  I'm just smearing it all over my face.
[03:27:15.242 --> 03:27:16.783]  See, this is one dose here.
[03:27:17.303 --> 03:27:19.785]  This is one dose, but I'm just putting it all over here.
[03:27:21.038 --> 03:27:22.079]  So we'll see how this turns out.
[03:27:22.119 --> 03:27:23.860]  I probably put it in the wrong places on my face.
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:26.662]  Again, InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:27:27.082 --> 03:27:31.946]  You get these great products for your friends, your family, energy drinks, high quality supplements, and the eye cream, and wow!
[03:27:33.985 --> 03:27:37.447]  The problem is, we're live, so I can't go back and show what I looked like two minutes ago.
[03:27:38.188 --> 03:27:39.369]  But it's pretty dramatic, wouldn't you say?
[03:27:39.409 --> 03:27:40.109]  Yeah, it is.
[03:27:40.290 --> 03:27:40.550]  It is.
[03:27:40.590 --> 03:27:44.833]  And in two minutes or so, you notice a huge difference in the bags.
[03:27:44.853 --> 03:27:46.654]  And like I said, it's male or female.
[03:27:46.734 --> 03:27:49.416]  I mean, nobody out there wakes up in the morning and says, hey, I love my bags.
[03:27:49.456 --> 03:27:51.077]  I'm a female if I identify as that.
[03:27:51.918 --> 03:27:52.538]  I'm a female.
[03:27:52.558 --> 03:27:53.459]  This is working really great.
[03:27:56.181 --> 03:27:56.801]  InfoWorth.
[03:27:58.002 --> 03:27:58.783]  Yes.com.
[03:27:58.803 --> 03:27:59.804]  We're very, very excited about it.
[03:27:59.824 --> 03:28:01.145]  Here, let's go back to camera five, please.
[03:28:02.065 --> 03:28:02.866]  Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[03:28:04.534 --> 03:28:06.095]  Can we zoom in even more of those that can actually see that?
[03:28:06.835 --> 03:28:08.295]  Wow, it works in 10 hours, huh?
[03:28:08.796 --> 03:28:11.857]  Yeah, it works up to 8 to 10 hours is the average.
[03:28:11.937 --> 03:28:13.697]  It says even on the box and stuff.
[03:28:13.717 --> 03:28:19.659]  But right now, too, Alex, people can actually go to the site, become Preferred Customers, and they get a 25% off right now.
[03:28:19.719 --> 03:28:24.621]  So go to InfoWaresYes.com, and you get, like I said, become a Preferred Customer, and you get 21% off.
[03:28:24.641 --> 03:28:28.343]  So if I put this on, George Soros would think I was attractive and dating, because I actually have a crush on George Soros.
[03:28:28.363 --> 03:28:29.163]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:28:29.903 --> 03:28:30.423]  I think he would.
[03:28:30.843 --> 03:28:31.424]  George Soros.
[03:28:32.444 --> 03:28:33.164]  Join me.
[03:28:33.525 --> 03:28:34.625]  Now we'll complete your training.
[03:28:36.126 --> 03:28:36.586]  Join me.
[03:28:36.606 --> 03:28:38.747]  We'll rule the galaxy as father and son.
[03:28:40.387 --> 03:28:42.248]  Obi-Wan never told you what happened to you.
[03:28:42.328 --> 03:28:44.769]  I wouldn't be surprised if he orders some on InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:28:45.049 --> 03:28:45.930]  I really would.
[03:28:46.190 --> 03:28:47.530]  Especially with the deal going right now.
[03:28:47.550 --> 03:28:48.791]  I'm not gonna lie.
[03:28:49.211 --> 03:28:50.932]  I've got a serious crush on George Soros.
[03:28:51.172 --> 03:28:51.392]  Hey!
[03:28:51.812 --> 03:28:52.812]  Conrad, thanks for coming in.
[03:28:52.853 --> 03:28:53.753]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[03:28:55.680 --> 03:28:59.345]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[03:28:59.645 --> 03:29:03.090]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[03:29:03.430 --> 03:29:12.963]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[03:29:13.463 --> 03:29:13.843]  Study.
[03:29:14.143 --> 03:29:16.885]  This formula is 24 ppm.
[03:29:17.245 --> 03:29:19.025]  That's 32 ppm version.
[03:29:19.366 --> 03:29:22.207]  Is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:29:22.267 --> 03:29:24.628]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:29:24.888 --> 03:29:29.570]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:30.130]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:29:30.570 --> 03:29:34.351]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[03:29:34.571 --> 03:29:37.252]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[03:29:37.512 --> 03:29:40.813]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[03:29:41.194 --> 03:29:46.495]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[03:29:46.555 --> 03:29:50.717]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[03:29:51.577 --> 03:29:54.338]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[03:29:57.682 --> 03:30:03.128]  Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[03:30:03.248 --> 03:30:10.516]  He's got the exclusive at leozegami.com that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, forms shadow government with Obama.
[03:30:10.617 --> 03:30:13.540]  Leo Zegami, obviously this is critical information.
[03:30:13.600 --> 03:30:16.203]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[03:30:16.403 --> 03:30:30.112]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[03:30:30.572 --> 03:30:34.615]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[03:30:34.695 --> 03:30:37.517]  The political system is rigged.
[03:30:37.557 --> 03:30:38.658]  They have rigged it.
[03:30:38.898 --> 03:30:39.979]  Of course it's rigged.
[03:30:40.239 --> 03:30:41.600]  But by them, not by us.
[03:30:42.200 --> 03:30:46.322]  And instead they are from... Notice that, they're calling themselves the resistance.
[03:30:47.022 --> 03:30:53.385]  Everything we've said, they're now becoming that, then banning me to then step in as the body snatcher into the body.
[03:30:53.665 --> 03:30:55.046]  This is really ridiculous.
[03:30:55.146 --> 03:31:03.550]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order.
[03:31:03.590 --> 03:31:09.933]  Because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[03:31:10.754 --> 03:31:12.076]  Yes, we're good to go.
[03:31:27.196 --> 03:31:30.017]  Basically, that we were never going to get rid of Soros.
[03:31:30.378 --> 03:31:45.225]  Father, son, this family is going to continue pushing their New World Order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways and of course in support of Pope Francis.
[03:31:45.365 --> 03:31:51.268]  The words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Soros are very revealing.
[03:31:51.488 --> 03:31:56.651]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home.
[03:31:57.535 --> 03:32:02.137]  ...this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[03:32:02.697 --> 03:32:04.137]  He says, my home!
[03:32:04.358 --> 03:32:05.198]  So what is his home?
[03:32:05.218 --> 03:32:06.078]  The Democratic Party?
[03:32:06.118 --> 03:32:09.619]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[03:32:10.240 --> 03:32:13.221]  Or is the party of the United States of America?
[03:32:13.261 --> 03:32:22.004]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who is really, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[03:32:22.344 --> 03:32:27.107]  We got documents earlier this year in January that Alexander Soros was funding.
[03:32:27.127 --> 03:32:28.308]  Anybody can type this in.
[03:32:28.488 --> 03:32:34.753]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015 is the headline.
[03:32:35.093 --> 03:32:37.735]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[03:32:38.115 --> 03:32:42.418]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants.
[03:32:42.518 --> 03:32:43.478]  Twitter won't take them down.
[03:32:43.959 --> 03:32:47.481]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[03:32:47.521 --> 03:32:51.344]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[03:32:59.202 --> 03:33:03.666]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:07.408 --> 03:33:18.717]  You know, I don't even like saying this because it's so bizarre.
[03:33:19.438 --> 03:33:20.759]  It's so scary.
[03:33:30.928 --> 03:33:33.149]  You're listening to the number one band broadcast in the world.
[03:33:34.170 --> 03:33:37.411]  It's because we believe in free market, we believe in America, we believe in individuals.
[03:33:38.552 --> 03:33:41.053]  And we got loaded phone lines here, Millie Weavers will be popping in with us.
[03:33:41.074 --> 03:33:43.415]  I appreciate everybody calling in today.
[03:33:45.140 --> 03:33:47.582]  I just spent some time trying to fund our operation with great products.
[03:33:47.602 --> 03:33:49.103]  I appreciate the stations putting up with that.
[03:33:49.123 --> 03:33:51.105]  I rarely do that, but it really is good stuff.
[03:33:51.545 --> 03:33:55.348]  People understand what everybody's going through here who's a conservative, or libertarian, or a Christian.
[03:33:55.969 --> 03:33:59.271]  Trying to just fund our ability to get the word out and try to save this country.
[03:33:59.732 --> 03:34:02.854]  And Tom in Texas is talking about silenced on all levels.
[03:34:03.435 --> 03:34:04.636]  That's what he wanted to volunteer.
[03:34:04.656 --> 03:34:07.318]  We don't really screen your calls, where you're calling from, what the topic is.
[03:34:07.738 --> 03:34:09.359]  But he wants to talk about silenced on all levels.
[03:34:09.920 --> 03:34:12.402]  We're all pretty confident still, and we're all
[03:34:13.700 --> 03:34:19.144]  Not victims here, so we're kind of cool about it, but our First Amendment birthright is being ganged up on.
[03:34:19.204 --> 03:34:23.346]  The left, from universities to media to culture, is trying to ban speech.
[03:34:23.386 --> 03:34:24.587]  I got three articles right here.
[03:34:25.147 --> 03:34:26.448]  Twitter trolls force U.S.
[03:34:26.568 --> 03:34:29.810]  astronaut Scott Kelly to apologize for praising Winston Churchill.
[03:34:30.031 --> 03:34:30.971]  Why the hell did you do that?
[03:34:31.051 --> 03:34:32.132]  Now he's getting criticized for that.
[03:34:32.672 --> 03:34:36.575]  Columbus Day no longer a holiday in namesake Ohio City of Columbus.
[03:34:38.136 --> 03:34:39.397]  Austin considers renaming city.
[03:34:40.356 --> 03:34:42.937]  They just want to get rid of the Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[03:34:43.017 --> 03:34:46.398]  So, Tom, in Texas, what do you think about all this?
[03:34:47.698 --> 03:34:48.179]  Howdy, Alex.
[03:34:48.199 --> 03:34:48.599]  How are you?
[03:34:48.619 --> 03:34:49.199]  I love the show.
[03:34:49.279 --> 03:34:50.019]  Long time listener.
[03:34:50.059 --> 03:34:51.120]  First time caller, brother.
[03:34:51.680 --> 03:34:52.720]  Thanks for calling, my friend.
[03:34:53.901 --> 03:34:58.342]  Yesterday, me and one of my buddies went to the Cowboys-Texans game there in Houston.
[03:34:59.612 --> 03:35:05.313]  And we kind of borrowed Owen's idea when he went to the Ranger game of wearing Info Wars merchandise.
[03:35:05.413 --> 03:35:08.214]  And I have a Trump Halloween mask I decided to wear.
[03:35:08.494 --> 03:35:08.854]  Awesome!
[03:35:08.874 --> 03:35:09.874]  No problem with it.
[03:35:09.954 --> 03:35:10.834]  Everybody was cool.
[03:35:10.894 --> 03:35:11.414]  No problem.
[03:35:11.474 --> 03:35:12.434]  The fans were loving it.
[03:35:12.514 --> 03:35:13.495]  You know, it's a conservative.
[03:35:13.555 --> 03:35:14.515]  It's Texas, after all.
[03:35:15.435 --> 03:35:18.295]  But my buddy held up a support Kavanaugh sign.
[03:35:18.315 --> 03:35:19.896]  You know, very small.
[03:35:19.956 --> 03:35:20.956]  We weren't being belligerent.
[03:35:21.096 --> 03:35:21.956]  Everybody was cool.
[03:35:22.316 --> 03:35:23.996]  We even had video of all this.
[03:35:24.476 --> 03:35:27.497]  And the security in the stadium threw us out of the stadium.
[03:35:28.294 --> 03:35:35.139]  Not because, I don't know who complained, but somebody complained enough to get us thrown out of a football game that we paid a ticket for.
[03:35:35.640 --> 03:35:36.180]  Oh yeah!
[03:35:36.220 --> 03:35:39.422]  They're acting like Kavanaugh is right now, even though he's totally innocent.
[03:35:39.823 --> 03:35:40.803]  I want to see this video.
[03:35:40.823 --> 03:35:41.624]  I want to put you on hold.
[03:35:41.684 --> 03:35:42.585]  I wish you would have told us.
[03:35:43.706 --> 03:35:44.966]  Has the video been uploaded yet?
[03:35:46.287 --> 03:35:46.588]  It will.
[03:35:46.628 --> 03:35:47.008]  That's the thing.
[03:35:47.028 --> 03:35:49.069]  I put it on my Twitter and my Twitter was banned.
[03:35:49.730 --> 03:35:50.551]  Within hours.
[03:35:50.931 --> 03:35:52.212]  I was kicked off of there.
[03:35:53.024 --> 03:35:56.525]  Oh, they're so scared of us in public places with the InfoWars Army.
[03:35:56.545 --> 03:35:58.086]  Well, you can send it to us.
[03:35:58.166 --> 03:36:01.867]  In fact, I'm going to get your name and number, get you to Rob Due or one of the crew.
[03:36:01.887 --> 03:36:02.907]  I want to get you on as a guest.
[03:36:03.328 --> 03:36:04.808]  I want to show this band footage.
[03:36:04.848 --> 03:36:05.588]  So tell us what happened.
[03:36:06.849 --> 03:36:09.910]  Well, like I said, we're enjoying the game and, you know, we're telling it beforehand.
[03:36:09.970 --> 03:36:14.892]  We're high-fiving, just enjoying the day, you know, having a good old time at a football game, you know.
[03:36:16.621 --> 03:36:25.167]  We walked in and security checked us in with everything and about midway through the second quarter we were escorted out.
[03:36:25.287 --> 03:36:28.369]  So the only time it happened was when you showed that Kavanaugh sign, huh?
[03:36:28.729 --> 03:36:30.630]  Yeah, we showed the Kavanaugh sign.
[03:36:31.091 --> 03:36:32.191]  Don't know who complained.
[03:36:32.832 --> 03:36:33.772]  What did they say to you?
[03:36:33.792 --> 03:36:39.156]  Because anybody can show whatever they want, but now, oh my God, the Supreme Court Justice, that was a dirty thing you did.
[03:36:39.857 --> 03:36:42.418]  Supposedly we were told we caused a ruckus.
[03:36:42.839 --> 03:36:45.300]  How do you cause a ruckus at a football game that's already rowdy?
[03:36:45.320 --> 03:36:46.481]  That's what I couldn't figure out.
[03:36:46.795 --> 03:36:53.076]  Everybody's yelling and screaming at me because wow, I tell ya, the NFL's already lost like 30-40% of its viewers.
[03:36:53.596 --> 03:36:54.677]  All this politically correct stuff.
[03:36:54.697 --> 03:36:56.017]  So you're at a Texans what game?
[03:36:57.617 --> 03:36:59.258]  We're at the Dallas Cowboys-Texans game.
[03:36:59.318 --> 03:37:01.538]  Oh yeah, Texas vs. Texas, that's right.
[03:37:01.918 --> 03:37:04.579]  Well listen, I've absolutely got to see the footage of this.
[03:37:05.099 --> 03:37:05.859]  I can't wait to see it.
[03:37:05.879 --> 03:37:07.079]  I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[03:37:07.599 --> 03:37:09.200]  But good job with what you did, my friend.
[03:37:09.220 --> 03:37:10.540]  Send it right to you, brother.
[03:37:11.451 --> 03:37:12.652]  We're going to put him on hold, guys.
[03:37:12.752 --> 03:37:15.434]  Be sure and get his name and info to do with him, okay?
[03:37:16.335 --> 03:37:21.259]  Because it's Owen's idea, kind of like the Bill Clinton's a rapist thing, where we just get... Oh, by the way, speak of the devil.
[03:37:22.080 --> 03:37:23.641]  I forgot, it's on newswars.com.
[03:37:24.081 --> 03:37:24.722]  I forgot to get to this.
[03:37:24.762 --> 03:37:25.562]  They're going to have a...
[03:37:27.645 --> 03:37:29.928]  Nationwide tour of the Clintons.
[03:37:30.709 --> 03:37:31.169]  Here it is.
[03:37:31.550 --> 03:37:32.551]  Document cam shot please.
[03:37:33.493 --> 03:37:34.114]  Oblivious!
[03:37:34.214 --> 03:37:35.215]  That's what they should call the tour.
[03:37:35.696 --> 03:37:39.882]  Bill and Hillary Clinton readying nationwide stadium tour.
[03:37:40.603 --> 03:37:42.746]  But notice they're waiting till after the campaign.
[03:37:44.264 --> 03:37:47.627]  After what's coming up in 28 days, 28 and a half days.
[03:37:47.667 --> 03:37:49.989]  So that is the craziness that's on Infowars.com.
[03:37:50.009 --> 03:37:51.930]  We're gonna go to more calls coming up.
[03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:52.991]  The War Room's coming up as well.
[03:37:53.011 --> 03:37:55.653]  If we don't get to all of you, we'll transfer your calls over to the War Room.
[03:37:55.693 --> 03:37:57.255]  I'm sure they want to take you, but I appreciate you calling.
[03:37:57.735 --> 03:38:02.178]  Millie Weaver, you were there Friday, Saturday, Sunday, because they kept protesting after.
[03:38:03.279 --> 03:38:04.180]  They got in your face.
[03:38:04.440 --> 03:38:05.741]  You're pregnant, screamed at you.
[03:38:06.262 --> 03:38:07.903]  They attacked old men, you name it.
[03:38:07.923 --> 03:38:10.705]  We've already played some of the highlights, but this was crazy.
[03:38:11.066 --> 03:38:12.507]  What do you make of what you witnessed?
[03:38:13.871 --> 03:38:32.046]  Well, I was actually pretty dumbfounded when some of these women protesters who say they're for women's rights were shouting shame at me, saying I was disgusting, belittling me and harassing me as a female reporter out there, simply asking them questions as to why they're protesting.
[03:38:32.506 --> 03:38:37.528]  You know, I was being considerate of their feelings and the emotions that were all there.
[03:38:37.948 --> 03:38:47.591]  But just for them to do that, and also two of the women were pointing at my pregnant belly saying, shame at my belly and then shame at my face.
[03:38:48.231 --> 03:38:52.433]  And it's like, what's so shameful about being a woman that keeps her child?
[03:38:52.913 --> 03:38:53.973]  Is that not allowed now?
[03:38:53.993 --> 03:38:54.794]  Yeah, I saw the video.
[03:38:54.854 --> 03:38:57.394]  What is it about feminists that hate women having babies?
[03:38:57.414 --> 03:38:58.855]  They just, they hate life, don't they?
[03:39:00.126 --> 03:39:00.606]  Exactly.
[03:39:00.806 --> 03:39:06.728]  See, they don't want women to actually take on and embrace roles of motherhood and womanhood.
[03:39:07.128 --> 03:39:14.290]  They want women to try to replace men and embrace masculinity and just be all about feminism and man-hating.
[03:39:14.370 --> 03:39:17.651]  And that's what we saw a lot of during these Kavanaugh protests.
[03:39:17.911 --> 03:39:20.232]  We also saw a lot of crying and
[03:39:21.312 --> 03:39:22.633]  We're good to go.
[03:39:40.243 --> 03:39:40.844]  We're good to go.
[03:39:52.643 --> 03:39:59.449]  Well, imagine, he's more of a mainline conservative, not even that good in many ways, but better than what the Democrats would have done.
[03:40:17.964 --> 03:40:21.171]  And the fact that they are freaking out saying they want to impeach him and all this.
[03:40:21.592 --> 03:40:28.526]  I say Republicans should go on the offensive about all the fake claims and no witnesses and what looks like clear perjury by these women.
[03:40:30.169 --> 03:40:54.603]  Oh, exactly, and when I asked many of these protesters out there what they thought about the FBI and its investigation essentially not cooperating Blasey Ford's accusations, her witnesses couldn't even cooperate her accusations, essentially they just said, oh well, you know, the FBI, they were just told by the White House to stop investigating and to cease their investigation.
[03:40:54.663 --> 03:40:57.285]  And I love these women march up and go, he is a rapist.
[03:40:58.638 --> 03:40:59.859]  And what's your proof?
[03:40:59.919 --> 03:41:01.320]  Well, he perjured, which he didn't.
[03:41:01.720 --> 03:41:02.861]  I mean, it's just weird.
[03:41:02.981 --> 03:41:05.103]  It's like they're big babies.
[03:41:06.083 --> 03:41:08.385]  Their proof is that he likes beer.
[03:41:09.226 --> 03:41:10.126]  That's it.
[03:41:10.226 --> 03:41:11.207]  He likes beer.
[03:41:11.267 --> 03:41:13.369]  That's the proof that this man is a rapist.
[03:41:13.549 --> 03:41:14.570]  He likes beer.
[03:41:14.970 --> 03:41:17.992]  Well, I don't think that's how logic works.
[03:41:18.092 --> 03:41:20.614]  I don't think that's how reasoning or common sense works.
[03:41:20.994 --> 03:41:23.116]  But I guess it's how the liberal mind works.
[03:41:24.998 --> 03:41:28.561]  I mean, the lunacy that we saw out there was pretty insane.
[03:41:28.901 --> 03:41:43.594]  Now, there is video footage, which we were live streaming, which we're going to get up soon as well, where a group of Trump supporters and Kavanaugh supporters marched into this protest and were chanting, you know, USA, support Kavanaugh.
[03:41:44.114 --> 03:41:44.715]  We're good.
[03:42:04.835 --> 03:42:10.380]  Double standards, contradictions, hypocrisy, and lack of reasoning.
[03:42:10.900 --> 03:42:21.109]  These liberals were desperate to try any excuse they could to try to justify stopping Kavanaugh from getting an office because we all know what this is about.
[03:42:21.409 --> 03:42:26.854]  This is about Roe vs. Wade and these women wanting the right to kill their unborn children.
[03:42:27.014 --> 03:42:27.735]  That's what it's about.
[03:42:28.598 --> 03:42:29.639]  Well, we're not just saying that.
[03:42:29.679 --> 03:42:30.079]  You're right.
[03:42:30.279 --> 03:42:31.920]  Their sacrament is the abortion.
[03:42:32.360 --> 03:42:35.242]  You've had glorious time of the left, the CIA and others literally celebrating.
[03:42:35.302 --> 03:42:36.063]  I killed my child.
[03:42:36.123 --> 03:42:36.503]  I love it.
[03:42:36.543 --> 03:42:37.103]  It's so good.
[03:42:37.143 --> 03:42:37.844]  It's so juicy.
[03:42:38.224 --> 03:42:40.145]  Women have abortions about how pleasurable it is.
[03:42:41.386 --> 03:42:42.307]  Salon puts out.
[03:42:43.407 --> 03:42:44.168]  Vice puts out.
[03:42:44.228 --> 03:42:52.313]  I mean, these are sick people trying to infect us with a psychic virus of self-loathing and killing our life force.
[03:42:52.773 --> 03:42:54.114]  We'll be back with Mellie Weaver.
[03:42:54.234 --> 03:42:54.754]  Stay with us.
[03:42:56.055 --> 03:43:00.398]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:00.898 --> 03:43:09.803]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[03:43:10.363 --> 03:43:14.926]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[03:43:15.146 --> 03:43:25.432]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[03:43:25.452 --> 03:43:25.952]  We're good to go!

[03:44:29.248 --> 03:44:32.909]  That's why Ultimate Female Force is such a powerhouse formula.

[03:46:10.244 --> 03:46:12.445]  If I don't like it, though, I'm not going to say it sucks.
[03:46:12.505 --> 03:46:12.866]  I'll just say,
[03:46:13.426 --> 03:46:16.088]  Maybe it was me, could be psychosomatic, didn't do nothing for me.
[03:46:17.148 --> 03:46:20.450]  But I have a feeling it will do something, because I'm very sensitive to drugs.
[03:46:20.750 --> 03:46:22.291]  That's why I can't smoke pot anymore.
[03:46:22.691 --> 03:46:23.852]  It's too intense!
[03:46:24.944 --> 03:46:27.986]  My God, have you tried what the kids are smoking these days?
[03:46:28.006 --> 03:46:31.287]  I don't know how Alex Jones survived on Joe Rogan, man.
[03:46:32.027 --> 03:46:35.869]  Last time I tried marijuana, I was like a narc.
[03:46:36.249 --> 03:46:38.870]  I had to lie down on a cold cement floor, shirtless.
[03:46:39.271 --> 03:46:46.594]  And the only reason I didn't call 911 is because the idea of being in a gurney and going down the elevator and getting... I was at work at the time.
[03:46:47.014 --> 03:46:50.396]  And being put on an ambulance just sounded like too much to bear.
[03:46:59.102 --> 03:47:01.707]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.467 --> 03:47:29.152]  If you're a radio listener, we're showing outside the Capitol, feminists engaging in Kung Fu warfare.
[03:47:30.493 --> 03:47:33.235]  Training for the non-violent republicans that they're about to face.
[03:47:33.875 --> 03:47:38.399]  Let me tell you, the Pentagon and Special Operations can learn from this.
[03:47:38.499 --> 03:47:39.119]  UFC can.
[03:47:39.160 --> 03:47:40.901]  These are devastating blows.
[03:47:42.936 --> 03:47:45.337]  Actually, it looks like the worst fighting techniques I've ever seen.
[03:47:46.038 --> 03:47:50.581]  They, like, stomp backward, they stomp forward, and they, like, hammer down with their fists.
[03:47:52.301 --> 03:47:54.643]  I mean, what the hell is this?
[03:47:56.064 --> 03:47:57.445]  But again, no one's threatening them.
[03:47:57.505 --> 03:47:58.565]  It's all just made up.
[03:47:58.625 --> 03:48:06.969]  They're the ones that are, like, roundhousing pro-life women and, like, attacking pregnant women, attacking old men, and running around screaming everywhere.
[03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:10.931]  But meanwhile, they're, like, doing... If you're a radio listener, it is the most ridiculous footage.
[03:48:10.971 --> 03:48:12.711]  It's on Millennium Millie.
[03:48:12.771 --> 03:48:14.332]  It's also linked on Infowars.com.
[03:48:14.672 --> 03:48:16.873]  Paul Watson did a whole boil down with all her videos there.
[03:48:17.233 --> 03:48:20.335]  Millions of views the last few days of what she's broken down.
[03:48:21.275 --> 03:48:28.503]  And it's just like, I've never seen any fighting school, Millie, that has anything even like what they've been taught.
[03:48:28.643 --> 03:48:29.844]  Where did this come from?
[03:48:31.406 --> 03:48:34.930]  Well, I don't really think that their instructor is very credible.
[03:48:34.950 --> 03:48:37.593]  The instructor's already in a leg brace.
[03:48:38.474 --> 03:48:39.034]  It's an effective fight.
[03:48:39.054 --> 03:48:41.077]  By the way, they're wearing shirts that say nasty women.
[03:48:42.208 --> 03:48:49.192]  Oh yeah, and I think that it's an effective fighting technique if you're trying to swat at mosquitoes and stomp on ants.
[03:48:49.652 --> 03:48:50.573]  That's about it.
[03:48:50.753 --> 03:48:55.776]  You would not be able to fight off an actual attack with those moves at all.
[03:48:55.896 --> 03:49:01.299]  And to even try to pitch to these women that this is going to be a valid form of defense,
[03:49:03.422 --> 03:49:03.862]  Exactly!
[03:49:03.942 --> 03:49:09.991]  Anybody knows the real form of defense is in King of the Hill where he says, that's my purse, don't rape me!
[03:49:10.011 --> 03:49:11.192]  And you kick him in the huevos.
[03:49:13.086 --> 03:49:23.653]  Well, okay, look, I've taken some actual self-defense classes from Brazilian jiu-jitsu instructors, and none of this is what they show you to do at all.
[03:49:24.033 --> 03:49:28.796]  And I will say that the best form of defense out there is the Second Amendment.
[03:49:29.096 --> 03:49:30.537]  Ladies, get a gun.
[03:49:30.557 --> 03:49:32.919]  It is the greatest equalizer.
[03:49:33.319 --> 03:49:35.441]  Women can defend themselves that don't have any
[03:49:36.401 --> 03:49:43.528]  Fighting skills or karate skills against an attacker that's much bigger than just by simply having a gun on them.
[03:49:43.908 --> 03:49:55.039]  But these feminists that are so worried about rapists everywhere, rapists everywhere, they don't want to just inform women that, hey, get a gun because it's going to save your life at some point.
[03:49:55.319 --> 03:50:00.122]  Or you could take a ballpoint pen and jab it right in somebody's eye or their throat and kill somebody just like that.
[03:50:00.162 --> 03:50:01.883]  I mean, you've got to defend yourself.
[03:50:02.223 --> 03:50:04.685]  And there's other videos the left is training.
[03:50:04.725 --> 03:50:07.327]  I mean, it is the most bizarre weirdness you've ever seen.
[03:50:09.008 --> 03:50:15.832]  I'm sorry, but you can actually hear a woman that was on looking, literally cackling and laughing at these girls.
[03:50:16.272 --> 03:50:17.333]  What are they doing?
[03:50:17.593 --> 03:50:21.175]  These bizarre stomps and swats and all saying, no!
[03:50:22.583 --> 03:50:31.447]  You know, the only thing that that's probably going to accomplish is the attacker will probably die from laughter and maybe that will actually be their tactic.
[03:50:31.487 --> 03:50:32.128]  Maybe that will work.
[03:50:32.168 --> 03:50:39.611]  Well, exactly, but it shows the LARPing that they're all out there bullying and physically attacking people while they do not even Kung Fu training.
[03:50:39.671 --> 03:50:43.353]  It's like stomp the ground, do like this, go like that.
[03:50:45.074 --> 03:50:47.015]  This is just total insane asylum behavior.
[03:50:48.291 --> 03:50:50.554]  Yeah, it's pretty bizarre, Alex.
[03:50:50.934 --> 03:50:53.918]  There's definitely lunacy going on within the left.
[03:50:54.439 --> 03:51:03.170]  One thing I will mention is that after the confirmation happened, there was actually a woman speaking who was, you know, one of the speakers at the event who said,
[03:51:03.610 --> 03:51:14.057]  We have therapy, trauma therapy advisors on hand for anyone who has been traumatized by this confirmation.
[03:51:14.177 --> 03:51:19.901]  If you need help, if you need emergency assistance, please come up to the front right now.
[03:51:20.341 --> 03:51:22.182]  We have therapists on hand.
[03:51:22.523 --> 03:51:27.166]  And yeah, there were a couple crying girls who went up there and walked off with their therapist.
[03:51:28.206 --> 03:51:30.568]  These girls were traumatized.
[03:51:31.268 --> 03:51:32.890]  It just shows the hysteria.
[03:51:32.950 --> 03:51:37.193]  Traumatized just because a judge is confirmed to the Supreme Court.
[03:51:37.934 --> 03:51:40.917]  Remember the different videos that different groups got?
[03:51:41.938 --> 03:51:45.801]  Not just Veritas, but the groups that follow colleges.
[03:51:46.201 --> 03:51:46.942]  What's the name of that?
[03:51:46.962 --> 03:51:49.004]  What's the group that always gets the college stuff?
[03:51:50.005 --> 03:51:50.685]  Campus Reform.
[03:51:51.306 --> 03:51:56.610]  There's like 10 videos or something where they hand out pocket constitutions and people go,
[03:52:00.560 --> 03:52:06.107]  And then they go in, Campus Reform goes into the dean's office and goes, I saw a constitution.
[03:52:06.528 --> 03:52:08.471]  And they go, my little sweetie, come in here.
[03:52:08.891 --> 03:52:16.041]  We've got Play-Doh, we've got weaving, and they sit down at little one-foot tables like babies and they go, I've got a peanut butter sandwich.
[03:52:17.402 --> 03:52:18.883]  Who can I have that now?
[03:52:18.903 --> 03:52:30.732]  And it's like, what weird mental illness, but it's all psych warfare targeting and just making them these weird arrested development, like Antifa training videos we were just showing for radio listeners.
[03:52:31.773 --> 03:52:33.234]  They can't even do a single push-up.
[03:52:34.015 --> 03:52:35.496]  I mean, who are these people, Millie?
[03:52:36.929 --> 03:52:41.231]  Well, they're the hysterics that have Trump derangement syndrome.
[03:52:41.531 --> 03:52:49.894]  You know, I was even interviewing many of these protesters out there, which you can find those videos on Millennial Millie on YouTube or on Infowars.com.
[03:52:50.374 --> 03:53:00.938]  But in the questioning, I essentially asked them if they want, if the goal here is to push the FBI investigation past the midterms to try to change the results.
[03:53:00.978 --> 03:53:05.220]  You know, if you had new senators, you could get a different result with a vote.
[03:53:05.801 --> 03:53:06.742]  And they said yes.
[03:53:07.123 --> 03:53:10.349]  You know, some of them were like, yes, and yes, it's politically motivated.
[03:53:10.429 --> 03:53:17.182]  These, you know, of course, there's political intention and these accusations, but that doesn't make it hypocritical.
[03:53:17.935 --> 03:53:20.576]  You know, they say, well, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not true.
[03:53:20.596 --> 03:53:35.344]  Well, this is why so many conservatives and Trump supporters are questioning the credibility because, well, what convenient timing of these accusations and how convenient for Senator Feinstein to whip this out of her pocket last minute.
[03:53:35.684 --> 03:53:37.385]  Oh, and now Senator Feinstein...
[03:53:38.357 --> 03:53:38.577]  Yeah.
[03:53:54.974 --> 03:53:55.555]  No, no, I agree.
[03:53:55.575 --> 03:53:56.616]  They're going to go even wilder.
[03:53:56.636 --> 03:53:58.658]  So let me ask you this question in a moment.
[03:53:59.018 --> 03:54:00.079]  How far do you think they'll go?
[03:54:00.099 --> 03:54:01.340]  Because you asked me, have you seen the headlines?
[03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:01.561]  Yeah.
[03:54:01.881 --> 03:54:04.724]  Politico, Fox News, Democrats say they're going to get even more ruthless.
[03:54:04.744 --> 03:54:06.165]  They're going to get even more violent.
[03:54:06.185 --> 03:54:09.088]  They're going to get even more wild and crazy and more entitled.
[03:54:09.588 --> 03:54:11.490]  But here is the real feminist icon.
[03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:12.651]  These women want real training.
[03:54:13.192 --> 03:54:18.617]  This is Bobby Hill from King of the Hill, Mike Judge, showing the feminists out there real training.
[03:54:18.637 --> 03:54:18.958]  Here it is.
[03:54:20.779 --> 03:54:21.739]  Give me your purse!
[03:54:22.120 --> 03:54:22.500]  Now!
[03:54:23.000 --> 03:54:24.721]  That's my purse.
[03:54:24.881 --> 03:54:26.081]  Don't be afraid to shout it.
[03:54:26.101 --> 03:54:27.022]  That's my purse!
[03:54:27.402 --> 03:54:28.022]  Try it again.
[03:54:28.042 --> 03:54:30.183]  That's my purse!
[03:54:30.443 --> 03:54:31.623]  I don't know you!
[03:54:35.865 --> 03:54:37.166]  Get away from me!
[03:54:37.426 --> 03:54:38.646]  Get away from me!
[03:54:39.267 --> 03:54:41.107]  Come on, eat some dirt.
[03:54:41.468 --> 03:54:42.748]  Let go of my purse!
[03:54:43.808 --> 03:54:47.230]  I don't know you!
[03:54:51.372 --> 03:54:58.718]  And there you go, so we just gave them some real training, Millie.
[03:54:59.479 --> 03:55:04.503]  Well, a groan kick or a knee to the groin would actually be a lot more effective.
[03:55:04.543 --> 03:55:12.290]  Like, if these girls were actually out there doing knee kicks, practicing knee kicks to the groin, that might be a little bit scary.
[03:55:12.650 --> 03:55:14.251]  That might be scary for a lot of men.
[03:55:14.271 --> 03:55:15.032]  Let's roll some more, though.
[03:55:15.052 --> 03:55:17.394]  I like the little, like, six-inch stomp, like, mmm.
[03:55:20.896 --> 03:55:22.417]  And it's like, wow.
[03:55:22.517 --> 03:55:23.157]  I've seen that.
[03:55:23.578 --> 03:55:25.319]  I've seen that a lot with my three-year-old.
[03:55:25.359 --> 03:55:28.621]  When he doesn't get his way, he'll stomp his foot and say, no.
[03:55:30.502 --> 03:55:33.443]  I've noticed mentally ill people are really like tap dancing.
[03:55:33.944 --> 03:55:36.665]  And it's like the stomping and the banging does something.
[03:55:36.685 --> 03:55:37.906]  And I'm not trying to be mean here.
[03:55:37.926 --> 03:55:41.048]  I'm trying to understand, like, we're such an open, free society.
[03:55:41.088 --> 03:55:43.429]  We've created all these weird, crazy beta nuts.
[03:55:44.189 --> 03:55:45.770]  And then they just want to run everything.
[03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:47.952]  And they're like in their own delusional Froot Loop land.
[03:55:48.652 --> 03:55:50.514]  And then because we're so nice, they want to attack us.
[03:55:50.554 --> 03:55:52.156]  Millie Weaver, great job.
[03:55:52.537 --> 03:55:56.662]  So many amazing videos with you and your team that are on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:55:56.762 --> 03:56:00.727]  And they're going to be back on The War Room and other shows here in the next few days.
[03:56:01.127 --> 03:56:05.492]  You're following Trump and all the incredible town hall events he's having.
[03:56:05.532 --> 03:56:06.594]  So thank you so much, Millie.
[03:56:07.659 --> 03:56:08.419]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:56:08.439 --> 03:56:10.020]  You know, just one more key point.
[03:56:10.661 --> 03:56:17.705]  The Democrats aren't actually trying to stop sexual assaults from happening, because if they were, they would tell women to arm themselves.
[03:56:17.965 --> 03:56:25.629]  There's nothing wrong with self-defense training, but certainly what we saw here in this park on Capitol Hill was not real self-defense training.
[03:56:25.770 --> 03:56:27.911]  It was a weird cult-like activity.
[03:56:28.531 --> 03:56:32.135]  Um, but all in all, get out and vote, guys, because the war is not over.
[03:56:32.175 --> 03:56:33.937]  The Democrats are rallying up.
[03:56:33.977 --> 03:56:41.824]  They're motivated more than ever to get out to vote so that they can win the House and the Senate and essentially overturn democracy.
[03:56:41.864 --> 03:56:42.445]  No, I agree.
[03:56:42.465 --> 03:56:44.226]  They're like a giant pool of...
[03:56:44.907 --> 03:56:49.248]  Disease piranhas that have been given PCP and they want to throw America like a little baby into the deep end.
[03:56:49.668 --> 03:56:50.488]  Thank you so much, Millie.
[03:56:50.508 --> 03:56:51.388]  We will talk to you soon.
[03:56:51.508 --> 03:56:52.449]  Again, amazing job.
[03:56:52.969 --> 03:56:55.429]  And like she said, a lot of videos she hasn't uploaded in HD yet.
[03:56:55.469 --> 03:56:56.169]  It's coming today.
[03:56:56.549 --> 03:57:00.550]  We'll have that on The War Room coming up next with Owen Schroeder and of course, Roger Shiller and others.
[03:57:00.950 --> 03:57:02.471]  So we'll have all the latest for you.
[03:57:03.451 --> 03:57:04.011]  I'm out of time.
[03:57:04.551 --> 03:57:05.511]  Thanks for all your support.
[03:57:05.551 --> 03:57:06.531]  Thanks to local stations.
[03:57:06.551 --> 03:57:07.112]  Thanks, everybody.
[03:57:07.412 --> 03:57:09.232]  We have the biggest sales we've ever had.
[03:57:09.292 --> 03:57:09.912]  Free shipping.
[03:57:09.932 --> 03:57:11.012]  50% off.
[03:57:11.072 --> 03:57:11.693]  It's Christmas.
[03:57:12.313 --> 03:57:13.153]  It's Black Friday.
[03:57:14.767 --> 03:57:16.068]  Cyber Monday all into one.
[03:57:17.348 --> 03:57:19.490]  So that who knows we'll be here in December.
[03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:20.410]  Seriously.
[03:57:20.670 --> 03:57:21.771]  Least able to sell you products.
[03:57:21.811 --> 03:57:22.992]  So get them now.
[03:57:23.472 --> 03:57:25.593]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:57:25.633 --> 03:57:26.373]  We need your support.
[03:57:26.393 --> 03:57:26.834]  We need your help.
[03:57:27.094 --> 03:57:28.114]  I'm very, very thankful.
[03:57:28.755 --> 03:57:29.835]  But take advantage now.
[03:57:29.855 --> 03:57:33.838]  And we're just going to sell out at the last run of X2, Super Bowl Vitality.
[03:57:34.758 --> 03:57:35.679]  Doesn't matter.
[03:57:35.699 --> 03:57:35.899]  50% off.
[03:57:37.400 --> 03:57:38.320]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:57:38.820 --> 03:57:39.080]  All right.
[03:57:39.100 --> 03:57:40.001]  Great job to the crew.
[03:57:40.521 --> 03:57:43.343]  Coming up, the War Room at InfoWars.com for its last show.
[03:57:46.309 --> 03:57:50.631]  All these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[03:57:50.732 --> 03:57:51.472]  So I'm here.
[03:57:51.492 --> 03:57:52.112]  Hammering.
[03:57:52.472 --> 03:57:52.793]  Hammering.
[03:57:53.153 --> 03:57:53.513]  Hammering.
[03:57:53.793 --> 03:57:54.093]  Hammering.
[03:57:54.193 --> 03:57:55.494]  Stop the hammering.
[03:57:55.954 --> 03:57:57.435]  Stop the hammering out there.
[03:57:57.455 --> 03:57:58.296]  Who's got a hammer?
[03:57:58.576 --> 03:57:59.096]  Where is it?
[03:57:59.416 --> 03:57:59.776]  Hammering.
[03:58:00.097 --> 03:58:00.477]  Hammering.
[03:58:00.757 --> 03:58:01.137]  Hammering.
[03:58:01.417 --> 03:58:01.798]  Hammering.
[03:58:02.218 --> 03:58:03.098]  Where's the hammer?
[03:58:03.919 --> 03:58:05.760]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[03:58:05.860 --> 03:58:08.001]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[03:58:08.181 --> 03:58:08.521]  Hammering.
[03:58:08.841 --> 03:58:09.222]  Hammering.
[03:58:09.502 --> 03:58:09.882]  Hammering.
[03:58:10.162 --> 03:58:10.542]  Hammering.
[03:58:10.823 --> 03:58:11.203]  Hammering.
[03:58:11.603 --> 03:58:13.204]  Stop the hammering.
[03:58:16.328 --> 03:58:17.688]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[03:58:17.728 --> 03:58:19.289]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[03:58:19.429 --> 03:58:20.909]  Stop the hammering!
[03:58:21.209 --> 03:58:21.629]  Hammering.
[03:58:21.829 --> 03:58:22.209]  Hammering.
[03:58:23.009 --> 03:58:27.270]  And all these fools, and all these traitors don't get it.
[03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:34.231]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[03:58:34.832 --> 03:58:36.852]  It just f***ing sucks.
[03:58:37.192 --> 03:58:41.493]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[03:58:42.153 --> 03:58:48.076]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control everything.
[03:58:48.116 --> 03:58:48.476]  They're here.
[03:58:48.976 --> 03:58:51.877]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[03:58:51.937 --> 03:58:52.678]  That's what I know.
[03:58:53.338 --> 03:58:56.419]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[03:58:56.800 --> 03:58:59.481]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it.
