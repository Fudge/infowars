[00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:07.452]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:10.873]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:47.459]  This is undoubtedly the most important broadcast we've ever done.
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.226]  Now you will notice that if you were tuned into the show 20 plus years ago, a lot of you were, I would say that maybe once every two years.
[00:00:56.327 --> 00:00:59.670]  And then in the last five or six years I've heard saying it every six months or so.
[00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.853]  In the last two years I've been saying it every couple weeks.
[00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:07.239]  Because things just get more intense, more crazy, more amazing.
[00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.121]  At every level.
[00:01:10.642 --> 00:01:14.026]  There are human clones in chestation, inside mothers.
[00:01:15.327 --> 00:01:16.048]  AP's reporting.
[00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:17.990]  Now, we know that was going on 30 years ago.
[00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.451]  They're announcing it now.
[00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:23.635]  They're also announcing humanoids, part animal.
[00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:25.697]  They've had them for 30 years as well.
[00:01:26.518 --> 00:01:28.500]  That's in mainline medical literature.
[00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.310]  But again, they just say, oh, Jones is crazy.
[00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.812]  Then I can pull out MIT documents from 30 years ago.
[00:01:36.693 --> 00:01:39.154]  I can show you MIT 10 years ago admitting it publicly.
[00:01:39.535 --> 00:01:40.475]  That's what I mean, folks.
[00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:45.598]  They can't let me be on the air because we're unifying humanity around a better future.
[00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.661]  You go to YouTube or Twitter or anywhere.
[00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:51.342]  David Duke's got his YouTube.
[00:01:51.602 --> 00:01:52.843]  Louis Farrakhan's got it.
[00:01:53.564 --> 00:01:58.547]  The professor lady who's on the board of directors of
[00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:01.949]  The New York Times saying whites are subhuman goblins.
[00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.731]  She cannot because they're creating division.
[00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:09.955]  And I'm not saying censor Louis Farrakhan or David Duke.
[00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:19.762]  I'm just saying we're censored and taken off almost everywhere because we're focused, we're passionate, we're hardcore, and we know what we're talking about.
[00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:23.665]  I told you a year and a half ago that Trump
[00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:29.308]  is set to try to indict Hillary and others for treason.
[00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.490]  They sold us out to China, Russia, and others.
[00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:33.211]  It's his duty.
[00:02:33.792 --> 00:02:34.252]  It's our duty.
[00:02:35.974 --> 00:02:38.036]  That's why they accuse him of what they've been doing.
[00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:43.340]  I said on Sunday, here's the headline, Infowars.com, document cam shot please.
[00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:49.526]  Exclusive, Trump set to indict Hillary Clinton and other deep staters in coming months.
[00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.641]  The Desperate Swamp is aware that their end is near and is trying to discredit A.G.
[00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:55.981]  Whitaker.
[00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.242]  And we did a whole two-hour broadcast on that.
[00:02:58.702 --> 00:03:01.784]  I take you now to DrudgeReport.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:04.365]  Please put that on screen.
[00:03:06.005 --> 00:03:06.946]  Absolutely critical.
[00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:10.588]  Boom!
[00:03:11.248 --> 00:03:12.268]  What did Trump just tweet?
[00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:13.489]  And we'll go to his Twitter as well.
[00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:20.232]  Now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, and it was done on purpose by the way, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:46.990]  He also said yesterday, in lengthy tweets that I'm going to be reading on air, that soon Mueller will be totally exposed with the secret FISA documents that show it was premeditated, it was political, and it was under the command of Barack Hussein Obama and Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:53.598]  The presidency spying on the Republican Party and spying on Trump and coming up empty.
[00:03:54.678 --> 00:03:56.499]  They tried to frame Trump with what they'd done.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.302]  And now Trump knows they're coming for him no matter what he does.
[00:04:00.342 --> 00:04:04.824]  He thought he'd turn the economy back on and, you know, try to share power with the Dems and he thought they'd be reasonable.
[00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:05.224]  No!
[00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:06.465]  They hate America!
[00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:13.949]  There's a big poll out today where one in five Americans say they hate the country and hate the flag and hate everything.
[00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.391]  And it's getting worse at the colleges and high schools.
[00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:18.252]  So, there it is!
[00:04:19.417 --> 00:04:20.739]  The unbelievable news!
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.645]  Trump signaling directly to Mueller and all of them, I know what you did.
[00:04:28.107 --> 00:04:29.128]  I've got all the evidence.
[00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:37.337]  Daria, I sent you two links to Trump's statements and you ended up printing me the one that didn't have his full statement in it.
[00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:39.059]  Print me the one that was out of the Arkansas newspaper.
[00:04:39.079 --> 00:04:40.600]  I want to read all those tweets when I come back.
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.901]  Thank you.
[00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:43.632]  A lot going on here.
[00:04:43.732 --> 00:04:46.914]  And then the even bigger news that I haven't even mentioned yet when we come back.
[00:04:47.354 --> 00:04:49.074]  So gigantic it makes my head spin.
[00:04:49.835 --> 00:04:55.537]  China's official ambassador to the United States just threatened a new world war against the U.S.
[00:04:55.897 --> 00:04:59.819]  if we don't let China keep raping the living hell out of us in one-sided trade deals.
[00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.953]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:05:09.213 --> 00:05:10.774]  Obviously, water filtration is a great thing.
[00:05:10.814 --> 00:05:11.414]  It's a good thing.
[00:05:11.454 --> 00:05:14.676]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:05:15.036 --> 00:05:17.397]  And over the years, I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:18.558]  I learned what the best was.
[00:05:18.938 --> 00:05:23.961]  Now, the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:05:24.061 --> 00:05:24.601]  It's amazing.
[00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:27.202]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:05:27.342 --> 00:05:34.025]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotsSupply that have developed these filters, ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:05:34.205 --> 00:05:35.826]  He has a glut of them.
[00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:38.087]  He's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:05:38.127 --> 00:05:38.828]  When it's discounted, usually $200.
[00:05:38.928 --> 00:05:39.028]  It's $127!
[00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.013]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:50.174]  So, they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:05:50.514 --> 00:05:52.736]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:05:52.836 --> 00:05:53.356]  It's amazing.
[00:05:53.456 --> 00:05:59.160]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:09.497 --> 00:06:14.439]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.947]  Wednesday, November 28th, 2018.
[00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:37.671]  I have never sat here and seen this much incredibly dangerous news.
[00:06:40.018 --> 00:06:42.239]  Over-the-top, amazing news.
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.221]  Fantastical news.
[00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:47.823]  Outrageous news.
[00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:50.704]  Horrifying news.
[00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:51.745]  Positive news.
[00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:52.785]  It's insane.
[00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:56.468]  And that's because there's a quickening at every level.
[00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:08.835]  Communist China and their ambassador, their head ambassador, gave an interview to an entire group of newspapers and it almost got no coverage.
[00:07:10.217 --> 00:07:15.859]  Blaming Trump and saying he's going to cause a new world war and global depression.
[00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:21.580]  And that China's ready to go to war with the United States.
[00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:25.841]  We're going to read his full statements here for you.
[00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:30.082]  It's posted in full to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:07:30.522 --> 00:07:31.443]  China warns U.S.
[00:07:31.463 --> 00:07:34.043]  that trade war could escalate into Great Depression and World War.
[00:07:34.583 --> 00:07:36.444]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to say this very, very clearly.
[00:07:38.484 --> 00:07:52.029]  China, on average, had about a 200% tariff on us, depending on the currencies and their taxes being at zero for corporations now, and all the internal secret tariffs and how they manipulate things.
[00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:58.111]  And then if you count the intellectual property theft being $300 billion a year, and then you count U.S.
[00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:03.153]  companies that were actually funded by taxpayers and set up by DARPA and then bailed out repeatedly.
[00:08:04.486 --> 00:08:08.587]  Moving to China and becoming state-run, where they make you merge with the government?
[00:08:08.727 --> 00:08:09.487]  That's official.
[00:08:09.767 --> 00:08:11.728]  Apple, Google, they've all moved there.
[00:08:12.188 --> 00:08:12.728]  This year.
[00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:15.649]  The year of total big tech treason.
[00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:26.292]  And Trump is in there valiantly battling for our sovereignty, for our dollar, for our factories, for our industrial capacity.
[00:08:27.232 --> 00:08:30.033]  Because he knows the globalists set it up to transfer everything to China.
[00:08:31.311 --> 00:08:34.532]  And in the 11th hour, 58th minute, he's trying to stop it.
[00:08:34.592 --> 00:08:45.335]  And all these fools, brainwashed by corporate media, don't know that he's actually fighting for their cut-and-dry interest, but also the interest of the people of the world.
[00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:48.075]  China is the ultimate giant sucking sound.
[00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:49.136]  It's the bottom of the barrel.
[00:08:49.336 --> 00:08:58.238]  The world government, cashless society, one-child policy, execute you if you don't worship the government, total surveillance grid, Mark of the Beast program.
[00:09:00.117 --> 00:09:00.277]  In.
[00:09:00.618 --> 00:09:00.978]  Your.
[00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:01.578]  Face.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:04.120]  So.
[00:09:07.983 --> 00:09:08.764]  We're going to go over that.
[00:09:09.765 --> 00:09:10.705]  But I want to just say it again.
[00:09:11.686 --> 00:09:13.328]  China makes any U.S.
[00:09:13.368 --> 00:09:17.631]  company operating over there give them all the blueprints and diagrams to everything.
[00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:22.375]  That means if General Electric builds a hydroelectric dam, they give them every damn bit of it.
[00:09:23.092 --> 00:09:28.817]  It means if microchips get made over there for defense products over here, they get to put their little hidden chips in them.
[00:09:28.857 --> 00:09:29.998]  It's all confirmed.
[00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:34.042]  I reported 20 years ago on the chips.
[00:09:34.522 --> 00:09:35.403]  They were hiding and stuff.
[00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:36.284]  Now it's everywhere.
[00:09:38.428 --> 00:09:44.071]  Oh, but don't worry, Facebook's bad, because they let Republicans scrape names publicly and contact people.
[00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:44.731]  Give me a break.
[00:09:44.751 --> 00:09:59.559]  I'm not even defending Facebook, but they look at something that isn't one one billionth of what the CHICOMs are doing and blow it up, because Soros is involved in a hostile takeover of US and European tech giants, so he controls them with the CHICOMs.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.682]  And our governments are so aged and so stupid, unless you're talking about Senator Cotton.
[00:10:05.702 --> 00:10:06.483]  He knows what's going on.
[00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:10.276]  Jim Jordan knows what's going on.
[00:10:11.997 --> 00:10:13.437]  Matt Gaetz to a little bit of an extent.
[00:10:13.457 --> 00:10:16.677]  He doesn't understand we're being technologically taken over.
[00:10:16.737 --> 00:10:17.458]  And Trump gets it.
[00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:18.778]  His gut gets it.
[00:10:22.718 --> 00:10:24.759]  Trump said the deepest thing I ever did was start going with my gut.
[00:10:25.119 --> 00:10:27.159]  Because the gut is the entire subconscious.
[00:10:27.499 --> 00:10:30.720]  Hundreds of times more powerful than the cerebral cortex.
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.461]  And then your brain tells you in the gut, don't do that or do this.
[00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:36.321]  It's called intuition.
[00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:43.826]  Trump has a whole background, 72 years of understanding, and he's cheated all, and he knows, follow your gut.
[00:10:44.006 --> 00:10:44.546]  It's never wrong.
[00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:46.166]  My gut's never wrong.
[00:10:49.807 --> 00:10:50.767]  It's called being psychic.
[00:10:52.428 --> 00:10:54.208]  And real psychics run powerful countries.
[00:10:54.228 --> 00:11:01.109]  They don't have, you know, TV shows where, oh darling, you call, I tell you your secret, oh yes, that's a bunch of bull.
[00:11:01.289 --> 00:11:04.430]  You don't find real psychics on the side of the road at gypsy wagons.
[00:11:06.851 --> 00:11:08.591]  You find them as top generals on the battlefield.
[00:11:10.074 --> 00:11:14.037]  So, ladies and gentlemen, this is what we're dealing with here.
[00:11:15.499 --> 00:11:18.121]  And Trump doesn't want to see America suck dry and go down.
[00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:22.084]  He says, China, let's work with you, let's all be successful, but we're not going to do it at our expense.
[00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:26.728]  And so he's the traitor, and now the Chinese Chai Coms.
[00:11:27.842 --> 00:11:38.491]  Arrogant SOBs who think Trump's weak and control the Democratic Party and much the Republicans have red herringed Russia as the distraction when Russia is just trying to stop from being overthrown.
[00:11:39.152 --> 00:11:43.015]  Russia is completely on the defense, even cut their defense spending this year.
[00:11:43.916 --> 00:11:45.057]  They are completely encircled.
[00:11:45.757 --> 00:11:50.581]  But they've culturally come back and are Christian again and that's why they're powerful.
[00:11:51.622 --> 00:11:55.826]  And that's why the globalists fear them because in the seed of that is the seed of the future.
[00:11:57.096 --> 00:11:57.837]  We're good to go.
[00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:21.034]  Reigns of mass death, world government, total enslavement.
[00:12:21.154 --> 00:12:25.337]  People will remember in the time of total censorship and total wickedness.
[00:12:25.357 --> 00:12:28.160]  They will remember those that have a memory and have a spirit.
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.162]  They will remember and they'll be the greatest revival the world's ever seen.
[00:12:31.662 --> 00:12:32.283]  I'm digressing.
[00:12:33.984 --> 00:12:38.788]  Towards the God of justice and life and light and creativity and the universe.
[00:12:38.908 --> 00:12:43.272]  The real God, not the fake God that grabs life and twists it and diseases it.
[00:12:44.293 --> 00:12:45.614]  So we'll cover all this in great detail.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.601]  China officially threatens war with the U.S.
[00:12:51.722 --> 00:12:52.062]  And why?
[00:12:52.322 --> 00:12:53.603]  Because they don't have any cards.
[00:12:55.184 --> 00:12:56.324]  They have been propped up.
[00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:57.825]  They have been given everything.
[00:12:58.065 --> 00:12:59.646]  Their people hate them.
[00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.487]  Alibaba is a high-level Communist Party official.
[00:13:03.248 --> 00:13:04.928]  The guy that owns Alibaba.
[00:13:06.609 --> 00:13:09.551]  And he is tax-exempt in China.
[00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.773]  And his employees are below slaves.
[00:13:15.287 --> 00:13:18.670]  And just like Amazon's employees are below slaves.
[00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:29.959]  But it's okay because Jeff Bezos acts wimpy, wears little turtleneck shirts and goes, like Tim Cook does when these are monster sociopaths bare minimum.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:34.123]  Now, let me give you the other big gigantor news when we come back.
[00:13:35.891 --> 00:13:37.532]  DrudgeReport.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:37.552 --> 00:13:39.554]  We have it posted to NewsWars.com as well.
[00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:45.618]  Now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:47.880]  Trump tweeted that.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.541]  Trump tweets warning to opponents.
[00:13:52.443 --> 00:13:53.104]  And it is treason.
[00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:57.547]  They tried to overturn an elected president saying he was a foreign agent when they themselves had done it.
[00:13:59.034 --> 00:14:05.059]  And they legally spied on him when he was the candidate, when he was the nominee, when he was president-elect, and when he was president.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.622]  And they have stay-behind groups still doing it to this day.
[00:14:08.742 --> 00:14:10.624]  Oh, what did Trump come out last week and say?
[00:14:11.044 --> 00:14:22.714]  There are embedded mole groups and there are embeds, spies of the deep state all over the government blocking everything.
[00:14:22.814 --> 00:14:23.815]  Well, that's all confirmed.
[00:14:23.895 --> 00:14:24.815]  I mean, they brag about it.
[00:14:25.316 --> 00:14:26.617]  But where'd you hear that two years ago?
[00:14:27.762 --> 00:14:28.703]  Next year's news today.
[00:14:29.023 --> 00:14:30.964]  That's why the enemy hears this show and they're horrified.
[00:14:31.265 --> 00:14:32.446]  So what did I tell you Sunday?
[00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:37.689]  I told you a year and a half ago that Trump said this is clearly illegal.
[00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:39.831]  Presidents are supposed to be able to order.
[00:14:39.891 --> 00:14:40.872]  They want things investigated.
[00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:42.513]  The media claims he doesn't have that right.
[00:14:42.553 --> 00:14:43.294]  They think you're an idiot.
[00:14:44.194 --> 00:14:46.096]  And Sessions pissed all over himself and wouldn't do it.
[00:14:46.376 --> 00:14:50.119]  Well, Whitaker reportedly is going to do it and the new Attorney General after that is going to be doing it.
[00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:51.800]  And they're scared.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.342]  So what did I say on Sunday?
[00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:56.864]  Here was the name of the show and the article we posted.
[00:14:57.978 --> 00:14:58.558]  Exclusive!
[00:14:58.618 --> 00:15:01.999]  Trump's set to indict Hillary Clinton and other deep staters in coming months.
[00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:06.280]  The desperate swamp is aware that their end is near and is trying to discredit A.G.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.580]  Whitaker.
[00:15:06.901 --> 00:15:08.201]  I'll let it all out in two hours show.
[00:15:09.221 --> 00:15:10.201]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:10.762 --> 00:15:15.283]  And now, Trump shares image calling for his opponents to face trials for treason.
[00:15:17.005 --> 00:15:18.346]  They're going to call him a dictator.
[00:15:18.386 --> 00:15:19.267]  He said trials.
[00:15:20.087 --> 00:15:21.148]  That means investigations.
[00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:22.389]  That means indictments.
[00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:22.950]  That means trials.
[00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:23.770]  That means due process.
[00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:24.791]  And you know what?
[00:15:24.851 --> 00:15:29.115]  If Trump and Whitaker don't do that, and if we don't stand and do that, we're aiding and abetting it.
[00:15:29.515 --> 00:15:33.858]  What did they ban me finally off Twitter for and then lie and say that I'd call for violence when I hadn't?
[00:15:34.659 --> 00:15:35.179]  On every channel.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:44.487]  I said the President must get a new Attorney General in and must move criminally on the illegal FISA court warrants and the attempt to overturn the 2016 election, which is treason.
[00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:48.083]  And now you see exactly that is happening.
[00:15:49.123 --> 00:15:54.385]  Because it's the common sense default thing to do historically and it's what our guts tell us.
[00:15:55.705 --> 00:16:01.327]  Our gut tells us that we either go on the total attack politically or we lose everything.
[00:16:02.458 --> 00:16:12.701]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[00:16:13.081 --> 00:16:25.125]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[00:16:26.165 --> 00:16:31.426]  Or do you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[00:16:31.666 --> 00:16:32.846]  Well, that's dead naming.
[00:16:33.106 --> 00:16:41.128]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[00:16:41.508 --> 00:16:44.688]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:47.069]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation.
[00:16:47.229 --> 00:16:47.829]  We're borders.
[00:16:48.249 --> 00:16:50.909]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[00:16:51.369 --> 00:16:54.950]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[00:16:55.865 --> 00:16:57.826]  World War III was the Cold War.
[00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:00.888]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[00:17:01.288 --> 00:17:18.897]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.982]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[00:17:24.002 --> 00:17:25.283]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[00:17:25.323 --> 00:17:29.626]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[00:17:30.227 --> 00:17:34.269]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:36.611]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:39.813]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.215]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[00:17:42.275 --> 00:17:46.518]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[00:17:47.038 --> 00:17:49.800]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[00:17:51.288 --> 00:17:57.390]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:02.852]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective thanks to your support.
[00:18:03.672 --> 00:18:04.693]  You have been the most effective.
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.362]  At exposing what's really happening.
[00:18:07.963 --> 00:18:12.269]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[00:18:12.749 --> 00:18:16.234]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[00:18:16.835 --> 00:18:20.860]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[00:18:22.061 --> 00:18:23.182]  And without you, we won't be here.
[00:18:23.783 --> 00:18:27.786]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[00:18:28.987 --> 00:18:31.329]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.973]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year.
[00:18:36.474 --> 00:18:40.577]  So that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[00:18:40.657 --> 00:18:43.320]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.540]  We're good to go.
[00:19:10.208 --> 00:19:26.874]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[00:19:27.354 --> 00:19:38.598]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[00:19:39.418 --> 00:19:40.519]  Forced sterilization.
[00:19:40.859 --> 00:19:42.180]  Children being sterilized.
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.622]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[00:19:45.722 --> 00:19:49.485]  And Infowars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:52.086]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:53.847]  And we will fight until the end.
[00:19:54.288 --> 00:19:56.569]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:58.730]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[00:19:59.131 --> 00:20:00.311]  And thank you all for your support.
[00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:00.932]  God bless you.
[00:20:06.917 --> 00:20:14.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.700]  Big Brother.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.341]  Mainstream media.
[00:20:17.921 --> 00:20:19.022]  Government cover-ups.
[00:20:19.802 --> 00:20:21.242]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:20:21.502 --> 00:20:22.683]  Well, so does he.
[00:20:23.143 --> 00:20:27.845]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:46.135 --> 00:20:54.421]  If you just joined us, the news, the information is so incredibly staggering that I have trouble even covering it, quite frankly.
[00:20:54.962 --> 00:21:00.066]  Communist China is officially threatening to launch a military war against the United States.
[00:21:00.086 --> 00:21:05.450]  They've been firing on our ships in the undisputed South China Sea.
[00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.510]  China's never had any claim.
[00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:10.653]  They're now disputing it, obviously, and building all those armored islands.
[00:21:12.102 --> 00:21:15.605]  Now their head ambassador has threatened a global depression and global war.
[00:21:15.665 --> 00:21:16.826]  We're going to be getting to that.
[00:21:17.506 --> 00:21:22.410]  And the huge news that's now at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:24.612]  Also at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:21:25.013 --> 00:21:31.238]  Now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:21:31.318 --> 00:21:32.879]  Trump tweets warning to opponents.
[00:21:33.219 --> 00:21:35.201]  And I've got the Hill article here I'm going to read in a moment.
[00:21:37.352 --> 00:21:41.233]  And the controlled corporate media is already spreading this, like, oh my gosh, he's a dictator, it's so evil.
[00:21:41.393 --> 00:21:42.873]  No, he said trials.
[00:21:42.933 --> 00:21:46.754]  That means investigations, that means indictments, that means jury of your peers.
[00:21:49.295 --> 00:21:55.717]  Because these individuals are caught red-handed lying to Congress, from Comey right down to Hillary.
[00:21:56.957 --> 00:22:03.559]  They have all been caught involving Uranium One, involved selling out the Chai Koms, everything they blamed Trump for.
[00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.811]  And they illegally surveilled him when he was a candidate.
[00:22:10.011 --> 00:22:16.212]  They illegally surveilled his every movement when he was the nominee, when he was president-elect, and then when he was president.
[00:22:16.292 --> 00:22:16.992]  It's still ongoing.
[00:22:17.953 --> 00:22:30.215]  And we even had leaked to us, and notice it got zero news coverage because it was real, a DEA database that came to us through Maricopa County.
[00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:32.373]  I think?
[00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:58.330]  And I'm sitting there looking at this database, and that's Trump's private numbers, and they're all being surveilled.
[00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.251]  This is Obama surveilling Trump way back then.
[00:23:01.771 --> 00:23:02.952]  Oh, guess who else was there?
[00:23:04.112 --> 00:23:09.053]  My private cell phone number, and my private office number, that I don't even use.
[00:23:11.594 --> 00:23:12.174]  Think about that.
[00:23:13.695 --> 00:23:14.295]  I'm kind of honored.
[00:23:18.156 --> 00:23:20.516]  But this isn't just, oh, everything's being recorded.
[00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:22.397]  This is specifically being watched.
[00:23:23.362 --> 00:23:27.945]  People going in and getting into the audio files and looking for something.
[00:23:28.645 --> 00:23:30.326]  And we got that to the President, obviously.
[00:23:34.728 --> 00:23:36.710]  And, you know, Corsi is a heavy hitter.
[00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.311]  Formerly with the State Department, worked for major agencies.
[00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:41.012]  And, you know, Corsi was involved in that.
[00:23:41.032 --> 00:23:42.833]  That's one reason Mueller's so pissed at him.
[00:23:44.794 --> 00:23:46.395]  And they've been putting the squeeze on Corsi.
[00:23:46.415 --> 00:23:51.118]  And, you know, it's a love-hate relationship with him because, you know, he just has been doing some weaselly stuff.
[00:23:52.381 --> 00:23:53.502]  But I'm going to get into that later.
[00:23:53.542 --> 00:24:04.955]  He says, oh, I'm not going to lie about anything, but we sent out these emails to each other in a cover story because we did have contact with WikiLeaks, but then we had no contact with WikiLeaks.
[00:24:05.055 --> 00:24:07.318]  Hey, I was there with both of these guys.
[00:24:07.818 --> 00:24:10.742]  Unless they were both lying to me, there was no contact with WikiLeaks.
[00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:13.685]  But does it matter?
[00:24:15.626 --> 00:24:24.132]  WikiLeaks was on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, New York Times TV, BBC, and we were mad that they wouldn't give us the time of day.
[00:24:24.172 --> 00:24:27.734]  Of course I was contacting WikiLeaks and talking to a brick wall!
[00:24:28.415 --> 00:24:32.798]  I bet there's hundreds of emails of us going, why the hell won't Julian Assange come on my show?
[00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:43.966]  Technically he was on one time in the background when Jones Dottier, the head of the Reykjavik
[00:24:45.765 --> 00:24:54.670]  Parliament at the time, in Iceland, I guess they were dating, and there's Assange coming out of the bathroom, putting a shirt on, and it's live on there, and I'm looking at Skype going, hey, that's Julian Assange.
[00:24:55.530 --> 00:25:03.574]  It's like when Christopher Walken one time just walks into the show with my guests and sits on my guest lap, another dude, and it's Christopher Walken.
[00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:07.957]  So I mean, yeah, I mean, the FBI asked me, have you ever talked to Julian Assange?
[00:25:07.977 --> 00:25:12.279]  Well, I saw him through Skype once, walking around in Reykjavik.
[00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:17.032]  Have you ever talked to Christopher Walken?
[00:25:17.052 --> 00:25:20.995]  Yes, about chicken cooking and wine recipes while he sat on another dude's lap.
[00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:25.619]  I'm sure there's a copy of that on YouTube.
[00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:26.540]  They banned our channel.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.703]  It was on there with millions of views, but truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:25:30.743 --> 00:25:32.444]  I'm going to try to just settle down a little bit.
[00:25:33.405 --> 00:25:42.332]  And by settle down, I'm so freaked out right now and stuff's so crazy and so real that I'm having trouble even conducting the broadcast.
[00:25:43.013 --> 00:25:44.054]  I mean, do you understand
[00:25:45.530 --> 00:26:11.628]  Trump sending that tweet out is everything we told you was coming from our sources and the common sense and it just shows how real Trump is and what an incredible time this is because he's under massive attack and if they bring him down it means a much harder war and it means the globalists will be emboldened and it means generations of Americans will be screwed over even worse and the frustration of seeing people go against their own interest
[00:26:12.691 --> 00:26:20.112]  When China and others have been absolutely screwing us over with the help of collaborators in our government, whose ideology is hating the country!
[00:26:22.553 --> 00:26:34.115]  And because we're telling the truth and bringing people together, and quoting Martin Luther King, and saying common sense things, but they're only two genders, we're banned everywhere.
[00:26:34.155 --> 00:26:35.555]  They're coming after our banking.
[00:26:35.915 --> 00:26:37.936]  They're coming after everything.
[00:26:38.596 --> 00:26:39.636]  My family, you name it.
[00:26:40.535 --> 00:26:43.896]  And Americans don't even have an instinct to be totally outraged by it.
[00:26:44.237 --> 00:26:47.018]  Instead, the average American is just becoming numb to it.
[00:26:47.418 --> 00:26:51.039]  Oh, people say it's too bad what's happening to me, but what are you going to do?
[00:26:51.219 --> 00:26:52.440]  It's happening to you!
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:58.202]  I put myself in harm's way to try to raise the alarm to stop the globalists.
[00:26:58.282 --> 00:26:58.863]  I believe in you.
[00:26:58.903 --> 00:26:59.683]  Trump believes in you.
[00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:09.923]  I'm putting myself in harm's way because we're all screwed if some of us don't take a potential hit or two, or the ultimate sacrifice, to have a better world.
[00:27:10.343 --> 00:27:13.024]  We're going to lose it all if we don't stand up and speak out.
[00:27:13.504 --> 00:27:15.045]  I'm not doing this out of courage.
[00:27:15.185 --> 00:27:17.085]  I'm doing it out of survival.
[00:27:18.506 --> 00:27:19.946]  It's not heroic to fight this.
[00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:23.448]  It's not heroic to stand up against this.
[00:27:25.048 --> 00:27:30.761]  In some UK schools where they started the whole trans movement on record to sterilize and depopulate people.
[00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:42.757]  In some elementary schools, up to 30% of the children are now saying they're the other sex and starting to take hormones to trash their bodies.
[00:27:43.097 --> 00:27:44.758]  That is such mind control and abuse.
[00:27:44.978 --> 00:27:46.880]  Hey kids, do you want to be a boy or a girl?
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.720]  You want to switch sex?
[00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:48.601]  I'm your teacher.
[00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:49.541]  I'm not abusing you.
[00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:51.202]  I'm not taking you and screwing you up.
[00:27:51.562 --> 00:27:52.643]  No, we're just doing it.
[00:27:53.243 --> 00:27:56.405]  Think about how hard core this is.
[00:27:57.106 --> 00:28:02.169]  And we've got incredible footage coming up now where the quote trans movement
[00:28:03.376 --> 00:28:16.721]  And the drag queen movement, no, it's the sexualization movement of children, is getting up in governmental conferences and saying, we are grooming your kids, we're taking your kids from you, and we've got to do this, and we know what we're doing.
[00:28:18.321 --> 00:28:30.986]  We're weird, creepy people who are not going to talk to your kid at a park, we're going to come into your school that you're locked out of by barbed wire and checkpoints and police, and we're going to come up to your five-year-olds and we're going to screw them up.
[00:28:34.258 --> 00:28:41.939]  Yeah, one high school in England has 76 pupils that have already had their testicles chopped off or are taking hormones to block them.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:43.240]  It's all coming up.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.940]  But first, Trump signals.
[00:28:47.881 --> 00:28:50.781]  Try havoc and let loose the dogs of war.
[00:28:51.721 --> 00:28:54.562]  The treason charges are coming.
[00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:56.282]  Brace yourselves.
[00:28:57.082 --> 00:28:58.663]  This only happens every few centuries.
[00:28:59.183 --> 00:29:00.483]  And you're right in the middle of it.
[00:29:08.681 --> 00:29:13.149]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:29:19.201 --> 00:29:21.982]  So it's a long way to the top if you want to keep this country free.
[00:29:22.462 --> 00:29:27.584]  And that's why I love Ted Nugent, especially getting to meet him in person and spend some time with him a few times over the years.
[00:29:27.664 --> 00:29:32.326]  You can feel the energy, you can feel the spirit, and it's the spirit of America.
[00:29:32.346 --> 00:29:33.887]  Ted Nugent, what do we do about him?
[00:29:33.907 --> 00:29:37.468]  You just heard that chant, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:29:37.808 --> 00:29:40.689]  I say, literally, you are against the country existing.
[00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:41.930]  That isn't free speech.
[00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:43.670]  Get your ass out of here.
[00:29:43.911 --> 00:29:44.851]  You're a damn enemy.
[00:29:44.991 --> 00:29:50.252]  Well, let me see if I can take a deep breath here after getting the wind knocked out of me.
[00:29:50.292 --> 00:29:55.613]  Have you ever noticed that it's the Democrats who want to give away free stuff to everyone who will vote for them?
[00:29:55.733 --> 00:30:00.654]  As if there is an endless pile of taxpayer dollars from which you can plunder.
[00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:07.736]  Does the Democrats' free stuff mantra make you think back to when your parents told you that nothing is free?
[00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:11.078]  Do you wonder how and who is going to pay for all this free stuff?
[00:30:11.339 --> 00:30:15.862]  Should Starbucks be forced to provide a free cup of coffee every morning to those who don't have any money?
[00:30:16.002 --> 00:30:24.088]  I just want to know when the fedzilla gravy train of waste and torch tax dollars ends and personal responsibility begins.
[00:30:24.488 --> 00:30:31.493]  Remember that the government that is big enough to give you everything is the government that is big enough to take away everything that you have.
[00:30:31.853 --> 00:30:36.657]  And that's what the zombies and the brainwashed propaganda ministry left
[00:30:37.217 --> 00:30:38.858]  Zombies don't get.
[00:30:38.958 --> 00:30:50.085]  So those of us that do know that rugged individualism is the foundation of the American dream of independence and being the best that you can be, we better raise more hell.
[00:30:50.365 --> 00:30:55.628]  We better get more Republicans in our families, in our workforce, in churches, in school, in the deer camp.
[00:30:55.928 --> 00:30:57.449]  We need to raise more hell.
[00:30:57.449 --> 00:31:08.774]  Well, we need to shout from the mountaintop of our everyday lives what the Constitution, the Bill of Rights identifies and outlines, and start demanding that kind of accountability from our elected employees.
[00:31:08.974 --> 00:31:23.161]  Yeah, bottom line is, if you believe enough in the American dream, and that you choose your own path in life, and you do the best that you can do, if you believe in that, you can't just do it unto yourself.
[00:31:23.241 --> 00:31:25.242]  You have to demand that from everyone around you.
[00:31:25.662 --> 00:31:26.904]  We're good to go.
[00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:50.373]  Ted Nugent, you are awesome.
[00:31:50.413 --> 00:31:52.075]  The album comes out in two days.
[00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:53.176]  The music made me do it.
[00:31:53.256 --> 00:31:54.898]  I'm gonna be getting it at tednugent.com.
[00:31:54.998 --> 00:31:55.539]  God bless you.
[00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:57.801]  We'll keep fighting and we'll talk to you very soon, sir.
[00:32:02.574 --> 00:32:10.562]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from Infowarslife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[00:32:54.243 --> 00:32:57.745]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[00:32:58.086 --> 00:32:59.647]  It is XtendoWise.
[00:32:59.687 --> 00:33:01.869]  Now available at m4warslife.com.
[00:33:06.478 --> 00:33:19.145]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.226 --> 00:33:28.269]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:30.831]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.157 --> 00:33:49.983]  Judge Reports got three big articles out of the Miami Herald and other papers about a big investigative piece about how bipartisan groups, both Republicans and Democrats, worked to protect Jeffrey Epstein, who was running a giant child-kidnapping rape ring.
[00:33:50.603 --> 00:33:51.983]  Robert Mueller was also involved.
[00:33:52.083 --> 00:33:54.985]  That came out that he was an informant to Mueller for years.
[00:33:55.005 --> 00:33:57.445]  That's why Epstein only spent a few months in prison.
[00:33:58.786 --> 00:34:00.367]  Cops worked to put Epstein in prison.
[00:34:00.407 --> 00:34:01.167]  Prosecutors worked
[00:34:02.108 --> 00:34:10.534]  To cut him a break, and then the news will only report on it because a future Trump cabinet member gave serial sex abuser deal of a lifetime, which is true!
[00:34:12.455 --> 00:34:20.840]  And that just shows how Trump's gotta do more vetting about who he brings in, but the Democrat connections of Bill Clinton on the airplanes and all of it is just incredible.
[00:34:23.702 --> 00:34:29.046]  But what does the news do when I come out and expose this and show people federal court documents on air?
[00:34:30.327 --> 00:34:30.767]  They say,
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.043]  Jones says Robert Mueller is raping little girls.
[00:34:38.944 --> 00:34:43.187]  What I said was Robert Mueller doesn't rape them, he just knows about it and uses it for blackmail.
[00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:44.768]  Which is all coming out.
[00:34:46.509 --> 00:34:49.371]  But notice it's not front page about Mueller.
[00:34:49.691 --> 00:34:53.314]  It's about somebody else connected out of hundreds because that person's connected to Trump.
[00:34:53.954 --> 00:34:58.898]  Every piece of news is looked at through that prism and then spun to demonize Trump.
[00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:01.932]  The entire system, because Trump is real.
[00:35:01.972 --> 00:35:10.499]  And what he's real at is taking power from the globalists and moving it pragmatically back into the constitutional organs and doing deals that aren't 100% anti-American.
[00:35:10.519 --> 00:35:26.554]  We're going to get to that here in a moment, but I really do first want to get into how Trump is about to move on the deep state.
[00:35:28.064 --> 00:35:35.127]  And the fireworks that you're about to see and how the deep state's arrogance is what's driven Trump to do this because he would have let them go off into abstentia.
[00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:41.629]  He would have let them, you know, go off into a purgatory politically with their stolen loot.
[00:35:42.389 --> 00:35:43.850]  And that's done a lot at the end of wars.
[00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.571]  You don't want to destroy your opposition completely because then they'll fight to the death.
[00:35:49.652 --> 00:35:51.833]  You just want to basically banish them.
[00:35:53.101 --> 00:35:56.563]  But that's not what's happening now.
[00:35:56.643 --> 00:35:57.824]  They're going for the jugular.
[00:35:58.364 --> 00:36:06.829]  So you see a different climate here, where in the past, both parties kind of protected each other on corruption.
[00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:09.970]  But now, that is not the season we're in.
[00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.752]  We're in the season of the abyss, where anything goes.
[00:36:13.512 --> 00:36:21.677]  And the amount of corruption and crime and evil on the Democrat, deep state, globalist side is thousands to one compared to what Trump's got going on.
[00:36:23.166 --> 00:36:24.987]  They're looking for crooked toenails on Trump.
[00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:28.469]  They're looking for employees of his or associates that didn't pay their taxes.
[00:36:28.509 --> 00:36:30.791]  I mean, they're finding nothing because there is nothing.
[00:36:32.792 --> 00:36:33.752]  Trump's varied by the book.
[00:36:36.874 --> 00:36:37.255]  And so...
[00:36:38.959 --> 00:36:41.540]  Why isn't Trump moving against them so far?
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.781]  Because he has cowards under him that wouldn't do it, like Sessions.
[00:36:44.041 --> 00:36:47.363]  And a lot of Republicans have been involved in corruption.
[00:36:47.403 --> 00:36:48.724]  Blue blood Republicans and others.
[00:36:49.564 --> 00:36:53.306]  And they're in this incestuous relationship, this Mexican standoff with the Democrats.
[00:36:53.706 --> 00:36:58.628]  And so they're all getting threatened, if you don't stop Trump, we're going to bring stuff out on you.
[00:37:00.669 --> 00:37:06.052]  So 40 plus members of the House that were neocons, they just didn't run for office or they resigned.
[00:37:06.112 --> 00:37:06.952]  They said, you know what?
[00:37:07.913 --> 00:37:08.253]  I'm out.
[00:37:10.012 --> 00:37:11.775]  I'm going into banishment.
[00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:23.052]  I'm being, you know, sent into the island of Alba like Napoleon Bonaparte was.
[00:37:23.893 --> 00:37:25.415]  They're running for the high grass.
[00:37:26.906 --> 00:37:39.914]  Because there's a real war in this country against the incredibly entrenched, wicked, horrible, child trafficking, narcotics trafficking, worst of the worst, generation after generation of corrupt people getting more and more bad people in.
[00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:42.976]  America on its deathbed because of these people.
[00:37:44.377 --> 00:37:45.618]  And here comes Trump in saying,
[00:37:46.837 --> 00:37:48.458]  We're not going to have one-sided trade deals.
[00:37:48.478 --> 00:37:49.679]  We're not going to have open borders.
[00:37:49.759 --> 00:37:51.500]  We're not going to tear down the American flag.
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.922]  We're not going to have, you know, the president promoting killing cops.
[00:37:55.623 --> 00:37:57.624]  We're not going to have the Chinese with one-sided deals.
[00:37:57.744 --> 00:37:58.144]  It's over.
[00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:02.007]  We're not going to pay for all of NATO.
[00:38:02.027 --> 00:38:03.167]  We're not going to do all this.
[00:38:03.608 --> 00:38:06.069]  This has run us in the ground by design and it's over.
[00:38:06.449 --> 00:38:07.990]  And so all these traders are pissed off.
[00:38:09.411 --> 00:38:11.753]  And there's a lot of other conformists and cowards out there.
[00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:18.118]  Who think they can get brownie points with the system if they're anti-Trump, anti-American.
[00:38:18.658 --> 00:38:21.319]  And for them, they're just virtue signaling to be left alone.
[00:38:22.479 --> 00:38:25.781]  They don't get that by behaving like that, we could lose it all.
[00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:31.343]  And the globalists really plan on turning us into a banana boat republic.
[00:38:32.724 --> 00:38:35.225]  So, if you just joined us, here's the gigantor news.
[00:38:36.545 --> 00:38:40.927]  Trump shares image calling for his opponents to face trials for treason.
[00:38:43.931 --> 00:38:45.252]  And it's an image we'll put on screen.
[00:38:47.013 --> 00:38:54.476]  Now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials begin for treason?
[00:38:54.516 --> 00:39:07.623]  And we've got Robert Mueller, we've got John Podesta, we've got Barack Obama, we've got Eric Holder, we've got Hillary Clinton, we've got Uma Abedin, we've got John Brennan, we've got James Comey, we've got Bill Clinton right there in the front too.
[00:39:09.039 --> 00:39:13.982]  By the way, I'm about two weeks overdue on announcing the meme contest winner.
[00:39:14.002 --> 00:39:15.262]  $10,000 NPC meme winner.
[00:39:15.502 --> 00:39:17.183]  I'll announce it at the end of the show today, I promise.
[00:39:17.203 --> 00:39:18.064]  And we're going to play the piece.
[00:39:18.404 --> 00:39:18.944]  So one winner, $10,000.
[00:39:19.084 --> 00:39:20.105]  Congratulations.
[00:39:20.445 --> 00:39:21.285]  We'll announce it at the end of the show.
[00:39:21.305 --> 00:39:26.768]  I always do the contest, and I always pay out on the contest, but it's usually late because I get so busy.
[00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:29.750]  Usually because we get so many entries.
[00:39:31.701 --> 00:39:39.067]  How about, we don't even put any money on the table for this, how about everybody sends it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com or posts it on your own Facebook, Twitter, your own website.
[00:39:39.608 --> 00:39:44.512]  Other variants of now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:39:46.334 --> 00:39:53.280]  You could have all sorts of images of them behind bars or images of different criminals and what they've done and what's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:58.844]  You know, they always change the subject to the treason that somebody got the WikiLeaks information.
[00:39:59.844 --> 00:40:11.175]  And it shows all these crimes of Hillary in the deep state, trying to overthrow the country, cause race war, rigging elections, rigging debates, just devil worship, blood, semen, at Alistair Crowley events with John Podesta.
[00:40:11.195 --> 00:40:11.956]  I mean, it's right there.
[00:40:12.256 --> 00:40:14.018]  The kids will be in the hot tub for your enjoyment.
[00:40:14.298 --> 00:40:14.939]  Spirit cooking.
[00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:18.122]  There it all is.
[00:40:19.608 --> 00:40:23.694]  And you just changed the subject to, how did Julian Assange get these?
[00:40:23.754 --> 00:40:29.822]  And anyone that ever talked to him is going to prison, even though every mainstream media had talked to him, because he thought they were his buddies.
[00:40:30.543 --> 00:40:35.130]  But if you hadn't ever talked to him while you were facing prison, because you're not allowed to even try to talk to a whistleblower.
[00:40:37.523 --> 00:40:43.625]  And notice, they're honing in on Roger Stone, honing in on Jerome Corsi, both of which work here, or have worked here, at Infowars.
[00:40:43.645 --> 00:40:44.385]  That's why we're under attack.
[00:40:44.405 --> 00:40:48.006]  So, I'm going to dive right into his tweets, right into his statements, and what this really means.
[00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:49.027]  This is amazing.
[00:40:49.067 --> 00:40:50.307]  It means Trump is going for it.
[00:40:52.488 --> 00:40:53.928]  He doesn't just issue warnings to people.
[00:40:53.968 --> 00:40:54.888]  He's already issued those.
[00:40:54.908 --> 00:40:55.669]  They're not taking them.
[00:40:56.469 --> 00:40:57.109]  They're criminals.
[00:40:58.089 --> 00:41:02.151]  And Trump knows that Mueller's involved with uranium deals and everything he's being accused of.
[00:41:02.211 --> 00:41:04.211]  And Trump is like, this is insane.
[00:41:04.911 --> 00:41:06.352]  And if they want to fight, let's get it on.
[00:41:07.346 --> 00:41:12.131]  But the horrible bureaucrats and slime bags that infest our government.
[00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:19.359]  We're going to come back with that in the China, threatening war and depression against the U.S., unprecedented because Trump's standing up to them, making U.S.
[00:41:19.399 --> 00:41:22.842]  companies that work in China give them all their secrets so they can steal them.
[00:41:22.862 --> 00:41:23.963]  That's law in China.
[00:41:24.584 --> 00:41:30.010]  Stealing $300 billion a year in intellectual property, a $500 billion trade deficit, on top of that we're talking
[00:41:31.203 --> 00:41:32.284]  Almost a trillion dollars here.
[00:41:33.024 --> 00:41:34.806]  All one-sided, and Trump's like, it's over.
[00:41:35.106 --> 00:41:37.287]  GM's moving to China with five plants.
[00:41:37.648 --> 00:41:40.770]  They posted record profits after we bailed them out ten years ago.
[00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:42.211]  Taxpayers.
[00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:47.895]  And then, they're such globalists that they shut down plants in key areas where Trump pledged to keep them open.
[00:41:48.375 --> 00:41:51.817]  Not because they're not making money, but because they hate this country.
[00:41:53.819 --> 00:41:54.980]  Man, I gotta tell you, folks.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.481]  Chevy loves Obama.
[00:41:57.501 --> 00:41:58.722]  They love the globalists there.
[00:41:58.822 --> 00:41:59.143]  Unbelievable.
[00:41:59.343 --> 00:42:00.824]  You know, they're trying to shut us down financially.
[00:42:02.602 --> 00:42:07.384]  That's why when you financially fund us by getting great products you already need, it's a symbiotic 360 win.
[00:42:07.404 --> 00:42:09.085]  And that's why I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:42:09.105 --> 00:42:11.987]  And I want to remind you all, without you, we're not going to be here.
[00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:15.809]  And the biggest thing is, go get an InfoWars.com t-shirt or get a Molon Lobby shirt.
[00:42:16.149 --> 00:42:16.809]  Spread the word.
[00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:19.030]  Meet like-minded people and help fund our operation.
[00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:20.751]  We make like 10 bucks on the average t-shirt.
[00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:21.892]  Every bit counts.
[00:42:22.632 --> 00:42:23.853]  We've got store-wide free shipping.
[00:42:24.534 --> 00:42:29.798]  Black Friday is extended to Cyber Monday week, but it's got to end soon because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products.
[00:42:30.518 --> 00:42:31.239]  X3 is in.
[00:42:31.259 --> 00:42:33.701]  We're selling out of X2, the last run of that.
[00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:38.264]  We've got the Alexa Pure Pro water filtration, normally $249.
[00:42:38.965 --> 00:42:39.865]  It's now $127.
[00:42:40.226 --> 00:42:42.788]  That is to move it all out for end-of-year inventory.
[00:42:43.348 --> 00:42:44.669]  Normally 200 bucks is unheard of.
[00:42:44.709 --> 00:42:45.891]  This is the best deal ever.
[00:42:45.911 --> 00:42:47.032]  It is the best system out there.
[00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:48.073]  Alexa Pure Pro.
[00:42:48.153 --> 00:42:49.194]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:42:49.254 --> 00:42:49.854]  Exclusively.
[00:42:50.375 --> 00:42:49.854]  $127.
[00:42:51.316 --> 00:42:52.717]  All the storable food sent off.
[00:42:52.757 --> 00:42:53.558]  Super high quality.
[00:42:54.719 --> 00:42:55.440]  It's all there.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.561]  Double Patriot points.
[00:42:56.861 --> 00:42:59.223]  Whatever you do, please commit to support us and get great products.
[00:42:59.523 --> 00:43:01.185]  Do your Christmas shopping with us and help us win.
[00:43:05.229 --> 00:43:07.171]  We've had the biggest sales in our history.
[00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:13.183]  Because it's end of year, we want to get all the stock out, so let's pay inventory on it.
[00:43:14.443 --> 00:43:18.907]  George Soros has been trying to shut us down, trying to take our banking away, where we can't even process credit cards.
[00:43:19.487 --> 00:43:21.549]  You saw PayPal and others go, but we've got others.
[00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:29.955]  But I'm not going to sit there with a full warehouse of t-shirts, water filters, air filters, high-quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, really high-quality supplements.
[00:43:30.115 --> 00:43:34.819]  We're moving to sell everything by the end of the year and clear out our warehouse.
[00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:37.881]  And to do that, we're giving the biggest specials ever on everything.
[00:43:38.061 --> 00:43:40.942]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off on the high quality supplements.
[00:43:41.202 --> 00:44:06.749]  That's X2, X3, Brain Force, Ultimate Bone Broth, Super Mel Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Colloidal Silver, Super Blue Fluoride Free, Iodine and Colloidal Silver Fortified Toothpaste and Mouthwash, Happys, Mood and Body, Knockout, Ultimate Sleep Formula, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Bodies with 95% Humidoids, DNA Force, what an incredible deal on that flagship product, Pollen Block, Bio-True Selenium, Vitamin Mineral Fusion,
[00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:08.070]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:09.610]  We're going to have to end one of these specials.
[00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:17.194]  I may be able to extend this Cyber Monday special to Wednesday or Thursday, but one of the sales that's got to end is the Alexa Pure Pro stainless steel gravity-fed filter for 127.
[00:44:17.914 --> 00:44:22.896]  That is because the folks that make it want to get rid of it all before the end of the year, and they only had a couple thousand.
[00:44:22.976 --> 00:44:26.678]  It's down to less than 500 right now, so that's going to end in the next few days.
[00:44:26.698 --> 00:44:28.919]  Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system.
[00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:30.140]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, 1.27.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.221]  Leading competitors aren't as good at 3.50.
[00:44:32.842 --> 00:44:35.163]  It's a great deal at 2.49, usually.
[00:44:35.363 --> 00:44:36.464]  Now it's at 1.27.
[00:44:37.004 --> 00:44:40.487]  So, for yourself, your family, as a gift, it's a great time to do it.
[00:44:40.507 --> 00:44:41.748]  A lot of these are lost leaders.
[00:44:42.008 --> 00:44:44.189]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWar today.
[00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:45.190]  It's all there.
[00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.711]  50% off, bare minimum.
[00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:49.413]  Some of it is 75% off.
[00:44:49.773 --> 00:44:51.554]  Double Patriot points on top of free shipping.
[00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:53.536]  Instead of 5 points, what's your next purchase?
[00:44:53.556 --> 00:44:53.776]  10 points.
[00:44:54.036 --> 00:44:59.639]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:03.821]  Three words.
[00:45:04.861 --> 00:45:06.542]  Energized quantum state.
[00:45:08.103 --> 00:45:08.623]  Two words.
[00:45:10.244 --> 00:45:10.364]  X3.
[00:45:11.844 --> 00:45:16.166]  You've seen how the entire global power structure is desperate to shut us down.
[00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:17.487]  And it's for good reasons.
[00:45:18.367 --> 00:45:19.548]  We've done our research.
[00:45:19.848 --> 00:45:21.429]  We've seen how they're targeting the people.
[00:45:24.206 --> 00:45:24.787]  I don't know.
[00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:50.971]  Survival Shield X3 is the latest in the X family and has all three types of iodine from thousands of feet deep under the earth so it's not radioactive or be contaminated by modern chemicals.
[00:45:51.531 --> 00:45:55.895]  And it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it and stops it from being oxidized.
[00:45:55.935 --> 00:45:56.156]  Folks,
[00:45:58.115 --> 00:46:00.777]  Everything we do makes the gloveless pull their hair out for a reason.
[00:46:00.997 --> 00:46:04.059]  Because, again, we study how they're attacking, what they're obsessed with.
[00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:06.601]  They are completely into iodine.
[00:46:06.962 --> 00:46:08.983]  They've even tried to buy us out and get us to stop doing this.
[00:46:10.304 --> 00:46:13.687]  And most of the forms of iodine are bound, and so you're not absorbing.
[00:46:15.208 --> 00:46:16.309]  X1, X2, we're great.
[00:46:17.447 --> 00:46:18.908]  X3 is the next level.
[00:46:18.928 --> 00:46:22.670]  It has the Deep Earth Crystals, the other two types, and a little bit of Vitamin C to energize it.
[00:46:23.070 --> 00:46:26.632]  It's available in 2-ounce and 1-ounce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:26.792 --> 00:46:33.895]  And from the very start, 50% off and free shipping because I want you to get it, and I want you to take it, and I want you to see what it does.
[00:46:34.596 --> 00:46:38.738]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, X3.
[00:46:39.238 --> 00:46:40.239]  Now again, it's an element.
[00:46:40.259 --> 00:46:41.799]  It takes a few weeks to kick in.
[00:46:41.819 --> 00:46:45.081]  A lot of people detoxify about three weeks in.
[00:46:45.141 --> 00:46:45.901]  So be ready for that.
[00:46:45.921 --> 00:46:46.662]  Consult your physician.
[00:46:47.382 --> 00:46:53.207]  Start your journey today at InfoWarsLive.com with our newest product that I'm the most excited about ever, X3!
[00:46:53.647 --> 00:46:57.570]  Just like our info changes the world, this changes your body and your life.
[00:46:58.731 --> 00:47:01.894]  X3, you can't lose, it helps fund the info war, and it's great for you.
[00:47:06.438 --> 00:47:09.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:36.043]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:52.091 --> 00:47:55.814]  You know, earlier I talked about how they have these big child kidnapping rings at the UN.
[00:47:58.116 --> 00:48:01.959]  And how we have this operating system of abusing children.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.624]  And that's going to be coming up later in the next hour after Faith Goldie leaves us from Canada.
[00:48:08.164 --> 00:48:14.850]  I'm going to get into the most shocking footage yet of city council meetings with adult men
[00:48:16.354 --> 00:48:31.371]  Dressed as women and not dressed as women, saying, well, I work at strip clubs, but I know how to hold it back and dial it back with your kids when I talk to them about their sexual life and who they're going to be growing up.
[00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:34.214]  We have to groom them so that they are drag queens.
[00:48:35.572 --> 00:48:36.993]  He uses the term grooming.
[00:48:37.853 --> 00:48:49.957]  Now, grooming is a law enforcement term of adults that want to make contact with your children, sometimes for years, and to get their confidence, generally through Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, school counselors, truancy officers.
[00:48:50.037 --> 00:48:58.140]  We're not saying all the truancy officers are pedophiles, but statistically, you know, you might find 5-10% in there, when maybe 1 out of 1,000 is normally in the general public.
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:49:00.541]  So they want to get around kids.
[00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:07.234]  Kind of like grizzly bears like to get up by the rivers where the salmon come by because they like to eat fish.
[00:49:08.155 --> 00:49:09.296]  You could say they're grooming them.
[00:49:10.457 --> 00:49:13.160]  Now, am I saying this individual himself is a pedophile?
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.502]  No, no, I would never say that.
[00:49:16.623 --> 00:49:22.108]  I'm saying there's a whole move to sexualize children and have people come talk to your children about being a different sex.
[00:49:23.592 --> 00:49:31.755]  And they have these drag queen story times where they tell your five-year-old, shake your booty, and they talk about, you could be a boy if you're a girl, you could be a girl if you're a boy, vice versa.
[00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:33.295]  That's all coming up.
[00:49:36.196 --> 00:49:37.057]  That's all coming up.
[00:49:37.157 --> 00:49:40.238]  So let me get into the big issue now.
[00:49:44.104 --> 00:49:45.685]  The story is at NewsWars.com.
[00:49:46.405 --> 00:49:47.545]  It's at InfoWars.com.
[00:49:47.565 --> 00:49:48.806]  We'll put it on screen for you again.
[00:49:48.826 --> 00:49:50.986]  It's also on DreadReport.com.
[00:49:51.747 --> 00:49:54.768]  And the corporate media is acting like, oh, it's dictatorial what he's saying.
[00:49:55.528 --> 00:50:04.251]  Oh no, you just got the Democrats saying civil emergency, drive Trump from power, the 2016 election wasn't legitimate, the Russians stole it.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.502]  Well, he's saying we need to have trials.
[00:50:09.562 --> 00:50:11.144]  That means investigations.
[00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:12.726]  That means indictments.
[00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:13.667]  That means juries.
[00:50:14.768 --> 00:50:25.820]  But see, Trump has all the documents where they knowingly, knowingly spied on him as a candidate
[00:50:26.929 --> 00:50:40.080]  As the nominee, as president-elect, and as president, and lied to Congress about it, lied to get the warrants, already had illegal surveillance going on, so they went and parallel constructed where you're already doing it illegally, so you create a fake warrant and fake story to get it later.
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:46.665]  He has them literally tens of thousands of times worse than what Nixon ever did spying on his opponents.
[00:50:48.166 --> 00:50:49.607]  He has them red-handed.
[00:50:49.848 --> 00:50:51.749]  That's why they're fighting so hard.
[00:50:52.129 --> 00:50:53.050]  It's why they're so scared.
[00:50:53.651 --> 00:50:56.353]  And Trump has them if he moves now.
[00:51:01.035 --> 00:51:05.138]  President Trump accuses special counsel Robert Mueller of ruining lives.
[00:51:06.379 --> 00:51:10.282]  He certainly hasn't found any Russia stuff, unless he wants to look in the mirror.
[00:51:11.263 --> 00:51:16.287]  The phony witch hunt continues, but Mueller and his gang of angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other.
[00:51:16.687 --> 00:51:19.710]  Wait until it comes out how horribly and viciously they're treating people.
[00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.472]  Ruining lives for them, refusing to lie.
[00:51:22.952 --> 00:51:24.294]  Mueller is conflicted.
[00:51:24.814 --> 00:51:25.955]  Prosecutor gone rogue.
[00:51:28.462 --> 00:51:34.626]  When Mueller does his final report, will he be covering all the conflicts of interest in a preamble?
[00:51:34.966 --> 00:51:41.049]  Will he be recommending action on all the crimes of many kinds from those on the other side of whatever happened to Podesta?
[00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:43.211]  WikiLeaks?
[00:51:43.491 --> 00:51:45.932]  And will he be putting in statements?
[00:51:49.774 --> 00:51:50.675]  You mean they are just now?
[00:51:53.038 --> 00:51:55.960]  Finding votes in Florida and Georgia, but the election was on Tuesday.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.583]  Let's blend the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin.
[00:52:01.724 --> 00:52:03.345]  The Mueller witch hunt is a total disgrace.
[00:52:04.066 --> 00:52:16.074]  They're looking at supposedly stolen, crooked Hillary emails, even though they don't want to look at the DNC server, but have deleted, no interest in the emails that Hillary deleted and acid-watched after getting congressional
[00:52:17.785 --> 00:52:18.205]  Subpoena.
[00:52:19.226 --> 00:52:25.592]  The fake news media builds Bob Mueller up as a saint, when in actuality he is the exact opposite.
[00:52:25.892 --> 00:52:31.998]  He is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system where he is only looking at one side and not the other.
[00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:38.083]  Heroes will come out of this and it won't be Mueller and the rest of the angry Democrats.
[00:52:39.064 --> 00:52:42.888]  And there's some more tweets where he gets into it that Mueller is going to be exposed.
[00:52:45.131 --> 00:52:47.432]  And then they spin that like, oh, Trump's being dictatorial.
[00:52:47.792 --> 00:52:49.733]  Trump says, you know, he's going to have treason charges for him.
[00:52:50.033 --> 00:52:54.415]  He's saying that there's going to be treason investigations and that they're going to get their trials.
[00:52:55.755 --> 00:52:57.396]  Because they're not ever going to go away.
[00:52:57.436 --> 00:52:58.716]  They're not ever going to stop.
[00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.357]  Hitler didn't go away.
[00:53:01.357 --> 00:53:02.678]  Other scumbags don't go away.
[00:53:03.038 --> 00:53:13.642]  And the deep state, a bunch of corrupt lawyers, all sycophantically kissing each other's butts up in D.C., think they own this country, think they own you and your family.
[00:53:15.305 --> 00:53:20.008]  The whole Blue Blood establishment has had this nation in a stranglehold for a long time.
[00:53:22.329 --> 00:53:25.350]  And they believe that they are basically invincible.
[00:53:27.031 --> 00:53:32.974]  Now, I want to go to a report here that I think really is self-explanatory.
[00:53:35.216 --> 00:53:39.718]  And we're going to post it a little bit later to Infowars.com so that you can share it.
[00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:50.433]  And I'm not even sure what I want to call this piece, but rock-throwing migrants use women and children as human shields?
[00:53:50.873 --> 00:53:51.534]  It's beyond that.
[00:53:51.574 --> 00:53:52.054]  Here it is.
[00:53:55.756 --> 00:54:00.018]  What is the one event that made this whole thing news?
[00:54:01.099 --> 00:54:07.723]  When it's been going on for years and years and years and was never news, was never reported, what was it?
[00:54:08.985 --> 00:54:10.246]  That made it news now.
[00:54:11.226 --> 00:54:16.470]  Well, first and foremost was the desire for the media to make it a story.
[00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:20.392]  There is no reporting the news or discovering it.
[00:54:20.552 --> 00:54:21.613]  There is making the news.
[00:54:21.953 --> 00:54:24.415]  That's why I call this a manufactured crisis.
[00:54:25.095 --> 00:54:28.837]  And Boorstin's theory is that it usually happens with an image.
[00:54:29.898 --> 00:54:37.463]  A still photograph or a video that somebody in the media trots out and uses the image
[00:54:38.503 --> 00:54:43.746]  To begin shaping the emotional reaction of consumers of news.
[00:54:44.067 --> 00:54:49.030]  I could sit here all day and tell you about President Trump's new zero-tolerance immigration policy.
[00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:52.011]  The one that's leading to the separation of children from their parents at the border.
[00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:55.874]  And I could help you understand it by maybe quoting numbers or statistics.
[00:54:55.934 --> 00:54:57.935]  I could play soundbites of officials.
[00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.937]  Or I could just show you a single picture.
[00:55:01.417 --> 00:55:01.857]  This one.
[00:55:02.478 --> 00:55:07.261]  Of a screaming, terrified, two-year-old little girl wearing a tiny pink jacket
[00:55:08.081 --> 00:55:09.442]  No laces in her shoes.
[00:55:10.603 --> 00:55:11.584]  Stopped at the U.S.
[00:55:11.644 --> 00:55:12.645]  border with her mother.
[00:55:13.325 --> 00:55:20.551]  She is quickly becoming the human face of Trump's new immigration policy, one he says he hates, but is refusing to change.
[00:55:28.577 --> 00:55:29.257]  Are we ready yet?
[00:55:30.018 --> 00:55:31.959]  How soon do you think we'll be able to get this cut?
[00:55:31.999 --> 00:55:33.841]  Oh, we're gonna be done in about four or five hours.
[00:55:34.733 --> 00:55:35.854]  Oh, that's good.
[00:55:35.894 --> 00:55:36.795]  We can link that to the press.
[00:55:36.815 --> 00:55:39.477]  They can downlink it on Telstar 401, transporter 21.
[00:55:42.139 --> 00:55:45.282]  And this just in, a news break special report from the Albanian front.
[00:55:45.462 --> 00:55:52.988]  We've just received information that the young Albanian national fleeing in this video is attempting to escape terrorist reprisals in her village.
[00:55:58.877 --> 00:56:04.379]  America has seldom witnessed a more poignant picture of the human race than that which armed... Fantastic.
[00:56:05.019 --> 00:56:09.901]  Thousands of people protested across Texas yesterday.
[00:56:09.921 --> 00:56:15.163]  They accused the administration of punishing undocumented children by removing them from their parents.
[00:56:15.603 --> 00:56:21.985]  Children and adults are seen huddled together in the building that's divided up into chain-link fencing that looks like a cage.
[00:56:22.025 --> 00:56:26.526]  Trump administration officials have been sending babies and other young children home.
[00:56:26.866 --> 00:56:28.087]  Oh, fuck.
[00:56:30.321 --> 00:56:33.930]  Mean-spirited and un-American.
[00:56:36.016 --> 00:56:37.279]  I can't do a walk of shame!
[00:56:52.015 --> 00:56:56.258]  Many people are psychopaths and sociopaths.
[00:56:56.278 --> 00:56:59.221]  They don't have any feelings, so they try to mimic them.
[00:56:59.761 --> 00:57:01.783]  And of course it was all fake.
[00:57:01.803 --> 00:57:02.844]  None of it was real.
[00:57:02.864 --> 00:57:11.571]  But now the man who claims to be the little girl's father says she was in fact not separated from her mother.
[00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:14.273]  The Democrats want open borders.
[00:57:15.675 --> 00:57:18.456]  Tensions boiling over at the U.S.-Mexico border.
[00:57:18.496 --> 00:57:18.636]  U.S.
[00:57:18.776 --> 00:57:21.357]  agents shot tear gas into the crowd of migrants.
[00:57:21.377 --> 00:57:24.458]  That tear gas injured two children earlier today.
[00:57:24.478 --> 00:57:30.040]  Reuters photographers snapping these images, appearing to show a woman trying to rush two children to safety.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:34.922]  There are those questioning the use of the tear gas on the women and children.
[00:57:35.182 --> 00:57:39.623]  What I find unconscionable is that people would intentionally take children into this situation.
[00:57:39.643 --> 00:57:46.365]  The caravan, as we call them, would push women and children towards the front and then begin basically rocking our agency.
[00:57:46.825 --> 00:57:50.387]  Those are people coming to the border, as far as you know, for asylum, isn't it?
[00:57:50.907 --> 00:57:51.747]  I do not believe that.
[00:57:52.507 --> 00:57:57.689]  I have an opportunity for viewers and listeners that is the best in my 23 years on air.
[00:57:59.938 --> 00:58:01.500]  Obviously water filtration is a great thing.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:02.141]  It's a good thing.
[00:58:02.181 --> 00:58:05.385]  And I've had water filtration sponsors since the day I got on air.
[00:58:05.946 --> 00:58:08.289]  And over the years I learned a lot about water filtration.
[00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:09.471]  I learned what the best was.
[00:58:10.152 --> 00:58:17.161]  And Alexa Pure family of stainless steel gravity filters take the already decent and good systems that were out there
[00:58:17.481 --> 00:58:23.905]  And took it to the next level of quality, durability, customer service, replacement filters, you name it.
[00:58:23.925 --> 00:58:28.848]  Now the Alexa Pure Pro is their biggest, nicest stainless steel unit that does the most gallons an hour.
[00:58:29.048 --> 00:58:33.490]  For your home, business, your kitchen, your RV, whatever, it's amazing.
[00:58:33.991 --> 00:58:36.452]  Cuts out all the bad stuff, leaves the good stuff in, the good minerals.
[00:58:37.032 --> 00:58:41.415]  Matt Redhawk and the Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply that have developed these filters.
[00:58:43.084 --> 00:58:44.786]  Ordered a huge amount of them this year.
[00:58:45.546 --> 00:58:47.828]  He has a glut of them at the end of the year.
[00:58:47.848 --> 00:58:55.255]  That's when you get the best deals on cars, is when, you know, the new model or whatever's coming out, or the next year's coming and they've got to pay tax on the inventory.
[00:58:55.455 --> 00:58:58.197]  $25,000 car, you're probably paying $4,000 or $5,000 in tax on it.
[00:58:58.778 --> 00:59:00.779]  And that's not counting state taxes, a lot of states have.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:01.620]  Texas has that too.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.984]  Now this inventory tax, franchise tax, that's why we try to sell everything out by the end of the year.
[00:59:06.564 --> 00:59:09.367]  So he's offering a filter that's a good deal at $249.
[00:59:11.926 --> 00:59:15.888]  Leading competitors are $300 to $400 for a unit this big, not even this good.
[00:59:16.268 --> 00:59:18.349]  We normally sell for $249 and it's a great deal.
[00:59:18.949 --> 00:59:22.171]  When it's discounted, it's usually $200.
[00:59:22.451 --> 00:59:22.751]  It's $127.
[00:59:23.491 --> 00:59:27.273]  He's selling them to us at cost, and we're making 20-something bucks on them.
[00:59:28.117 --> 00:59:29.298]  And I'm doing this as a favor to him.
[00:59:29.358 --> 00:59:31.440]  I said, my God, you're cutting the whole market out.
[00:59:31.480 --> 00:59:32.461]  I mean, I'm all for great deals.
[00:59:32.621 --> 00:59:33.682]  This is insane.
[00:59:34.023 --> 00:59:35.784]  So they're going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:59:36.205 --> 00:59:38.187]  You want to get Alexa Pure Pro for you and your family.
[00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:39.588]  Get the best, the best deal.
[00:59:39.989 --> 00:59:42.191]  This is the gift of life, the gift of health.
[00:59:42.291 --> 00:59:42.831]  It's amazing.
[00:59:42.891 --> 00:59:48.937]  Alexa Pure Pro at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:59:57.062 --> 01:00:00.464]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:41.624 --> 01:00:42.845]  You know, I just made a decision.
[01:00:44.006 --> 01:00:48.590]  I'm gonna give you ultra-massive news two weeks before it comes out, yet again.
[01:00:49.631 --> 01:01:00.460]  I'm going to throw down the gauntlet, and I'm going to... I'm gonna go ahead and drop some major intel on you that I've got from multiple sources on the other side.
[01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:02.903]  But first, here's part of John Bowne's report.
[01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.506]  All I want for Christmas is Hillary in prison.
[01:01:07.896 --> 01:01:13.038]  A nationwide alert to avoid any E. coli-laced romaine lettuce is in effect.
[01:01:14.199 --> 01:01:17.280]  We have some breaking news from the Centers for Disease Control.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:26.083]  The agency just tweeted a little while ago this new alert, calling it an outbreak alert about romaine lettuce, telling everyone here in the U.S.
[01:01:26.243 --> 01:01:29.705]  and people in Canada to avoid all romaine lettuce.
[01:01:29.865 --> 01:01:35.247]  And it's because of an E. coli outbreak that's already made 32 people sick in 11 different states.
[01:01:35.467 --> 01:01:45.612]  And I would also warn against swallowing any of the Democrats' BS-laced rhetoric as you travel to see friends and family who may have somewhat different political views.
[01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:53.876]  Be forewarned, the victory the Socialist Democrats had in the House over the midterms have rendered them drunk with anti-American fervor.
[01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:57.118]  And after yet again another Broward County debacle,
[01:01:57.338 --> 01:02:00.760]  Not since Watergate have they won by such a large margin.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:11.307]  Of course, former President Obama, who has now set a new precedent for criticizing a sitting president, took to poisoning the White House turkey as soon as possible.
[01:02:11.587 --> 01:02:15.349]  I hereby grant you a full pardon!
[01:02:15.469 --> 01:02:25.596]  We are still confused, blind, shrouded with hate, anger,
[01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:28.187]  Racism.
[01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:31.890]  Mommy issues.
[01:02:33.874 --> 01:02:43.537]  And where would the attack on domestic bliss by the left be without being reminded of criminal monstrosity Hillary Clinton, who along with the Democrats put the Trump family on notice?
[01:02:43.817 --> 01:02:59.942]  As Jamie White reports, Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, at the behest of Clinton, are planning to look into Ivanka Trump's use of personal email to conduct government business while she was transitioning into her position within the Trump administration.
[01:03:00.042 --> 01:03:02.483]  Interestingly, former Clinton spokesman
[01:03:02.643 --> 01:03:11.489]  Early on, and for a little period of time, Ivanka did some emails.
[01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.530]  They weren't classified like Hillary Clinton.
[01:03:14.931 --> 01:03:18.013]  They weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton, who deleted 33.
[01:03:18.293 --> 01:03:19.233]  She wasn't hiring.
[01:03:19.474 --> 01:03:22.395]  She wasn't doing anything to hide her emails.
[01:03:22.936 --> 01:03:24.757]  I looked at it just very briefly today.
[01:03:26.898 --> 01:03:30.681]  The presidential records, they're all in presidential records.
[01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:31.562]  There was no hiding.
[01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:34.264]  There was no deleting like Hillary Clinton did.
[01:03:34.564 --> 01:03:37.946]  There was no service in the basement like Hillary Clinton had.
[01:03:38.146 --> 01:03:41.589]  You're talking about a whole different, you're talking about all fake news.
[01:03:42.129 --> 01:03:45.732]  So what Ivanka did, it's all in the presidential records.
[01:03:46.212 --> 01:03:47.153]  Everything is there.
[01:03:47.514 --> 01:03:49.796]  There was no deletion, there was no nothing.
[01:03:50.217 --> 01:03:51.879]  What it is is a false story.
[01:03:52.199 --> 01:03:55.062]  Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails.
[01:03:55.383 --> 01:03:57.205]  She had a server in the basement.
[01:03:57.465 --> 01:03:58.506]  That's the real story.
[01:03:59.607 --> 01:04:03.191]  But the Clintons shouldn't feel so smug this holiday season.
[01:04:03.412 --> 01:04:04.533]  Zero Hedge reports.
[01:04:04.693 --> 01:04:18.365]  House Republicans will hear testimony on December 5th from the prosecutor appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation, according to Representative Mark Meadows.
[01:04:18.566 --> 01:04:21.368]  Well, we believe that it's time to circle back.
[01:04:21.648 --> 01:04:23.810]  Actually, Mr. Huber with
[01:04:24.771 --> 01:04:44.587]  The Department of Justice and FBI has been having an investigation or at least part of his task was to look at the Clinton Foundation and what may or may not have happened as it relates to improper activity with that charitable foundation.
[01:04:45.127 --> 01:04:48.630]  And so we've set a hearing date for December the 5th.
[01:04:50.527 --> 01:04:57.195]  And invitations are about to go out to the appropriate witnesses, of which obviously Mr. Abel.
[01:04:57.395 --> 01:05:01.120]  Alright folks, the full report is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.121]  That's John Bowne.
[01:05:05.129 --> 01:05:05.770]  E.T.
[01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:06.810]  on in Texas.
[01:05:06.830 --> 01:05:08.832]  You're on the air.
[01:05:08.852 --> 01:05:09.892]  Go ahead.
[01:05:09.912 --> 01:05:10.593]  Greetings.
[01:05:10.613 --> 01:05:10.993]  Welcome.
[01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:38.530]  And I hope to hear from you again, and I will always keep in touch with you.
[01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:39.931]  God bless you, Etion.
[01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:41.231]  I never plug Icarin.
[01:05:41.311 --> 01:05:44.873]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there, and make it even stronger and better.
[01:05:44.893 --> 01:05:45.893]  What has the best ratings.
[01:05:45.913 --> 01:05:49.335]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:52.056]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician.
[01:05:52.076 --> 01:05:56.317]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler, because they're scared of real supplements.
[01:05:56.357 --> 01:06:01.279]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[01:06:01.299 --> 01:06:02.720]  So Icarin and Infowarshore.com.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.030]  Yeah.
[01:06:26.781 --> 01:06:27.902]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:28.302 --> 01:06:33.267]  This is the InfoWar, coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:33.807 --> 01:06:49.561]  And I'm proud of the fact that the most criminal, anti-American, globalist organizations in the world and the controlled corporate press have made me public enemy number two, second only to our great president, Donald J. Trump.
[01:06:50.982 --> 01:06:53.485]  See, I'm not here just trying to cover my butt.
[01:06:54.346 --> 01:06:56.767]  Like most people do, and be a follower.
[01:06:56.947 --> 01:06:57.968]  I'm trying to be a real leader.
[01:06:58.988 --> 01:07:04.911]  People talk about what leadership is, about being able to speak well, or having interesting ideas.
[01:07:05.231 --> 01:07:14.776]  Real leadership is going against the grain when you know that the grain is taking the population over a cliff.
[01:07:16.016 --> 01:07:17.797]  Real leadership is moral courage.
[01:07:18.057 --> 01:07:19.078]  That's paramount.
[01:07:22.352 --> 01:07:23.532]  And then everything else flows from that.
[01:07:24.053 --> 01:07:26.873]  But if you don't have that moral courage, you're a follower.
[01:07:28.334 --> 01:07:32.075]  You won't just go on with what's trendy, you'll go along with people that are bullying you.
[01:07:33.015 --> 01:07:34.976]  And they'll never run out of things to demand.
[01:07:35.776 --> 01:07:39.717]  And so Thomas Jefferson was asked, what is the limit tyrants will go to?
[01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:47.599]  And he said, it's the exact amount that you will put up with.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:49.680]  Now let me do this.
[01:07:52.432 --> 01:08:02.360]  I have a lot of interesting sources, and I was getting this information a few weeks ago, and then I saw in congressional hearings, and in statements made, movement.
[01:08:02.901 --> 01:08:19.854]  And then the President's tweet this morning crystallized it all, that I need to talk about this, and I was thinking about breaking down what's about to happen, and then I got another message from an individual I know that has amazing sources, saying the exact same thing.
[01:08:20.775 --> 01:08:21.476]  And remember,
[01:08:22.449 --> 01:08:37.032]  You know, I told you the day after Vegas from the hostage rescue team that he'd been to the Middle East, the room was full of ISIS and Al Qaeda paraphernalia, that he'd been a gunrunner, and that there were other shooters, and all that later came out.
[01:08:37.452 --> 01:08:41.453]  And over a year later, they still won't give out an official statement.
[01:08:42.733 --> 01:08:47.854]  And that really was the FBI that told me that that morning.
[01:08:47.934 --> 01:08:50.355]  And they also had a question.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.021]  Now, had I said that night before, I would expect attacks on sporting events, concerts.
[01:08:58.961 --> 01:09:02.962]  I figure ISIS would probably attack at, say, 10 o'clock at night when the concert's letting out.
[01:09:04.903 --> 01:09:11.904]  And, you know, sometimes I just, I have all this info and I cover it all and 99% of what I do is just, is just, you know, right out of my analysis.
[01:09:11.924 --> 01:09:13.384]  But sometimes I just say things.
[01:09:13.664 --> 01:09:18.486]  I just, and then they're like, yeah, you said it hours before it happened on that Sunday night.
[01:09:18.986 --> 01:09:20.446]  And I said, I don't know why I said it.
[01:09:24.989 --> 01:09:30.331]  And I know that, uh, they then had a counterterrorism group investigate me as if I haven't already been investigated.
[01:09:30.691 --> 01:09:31.891]  I mean, I don't know why I said that.
[01:09:32.672 --> 01:09:32.912]  Okay.
[01:09:33.712 --> 01:09:35.893]  I just, it just felt like that was what was going on.
[01:09:40.374 --> 01:09:41.634]  And the Lord works mysterious ways.
[01:09:41.654 --> 01:09:49.117]  You know, that just slips into my mind to say so that then the hostage rescue team tells me what really went on and also then has their question from the FBI.
[01:09:52.927 --> 01:09:53.827]  But they're not stupid.
[01:09:53.847 --> 01:09:55.228]  They know how the universe actually works.
[01:09:55.728 --> 01:09:56.929]  Now, let's get serious here.
[01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:04.212]  I always tend to just blurt out the big, giant news when I feel like it's the right time to do it, and I don't ever build it up.
[01:10:04.492 --> 01:10:07.774]  I always say, coming up next hour, then I start saying what I'm going to cover next hour.
[01:10:08.294 --> 01:10:09.235]  I just want to get it out there.
[01:10:09.815 --> 01:10:15.638]  But stuff like this is so big that I really should, like, wait till tomorrow to tell you.
[01:10:16.938 --> 01:10:17.839]  Instead of just
[01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:24.291]  Saying, hey, here it is, and then I give people incredible information, and it's just like, ah, big deal.
[01:10:24.812 --> 01:10:30.656]  And then it comes true in a week or two, and there's not even any press coverage of it.
[01:10:30.956 --> 01:10:39.661]  And it's not about me getting attention or credit, it's about, they're trying to say I'm a liar, they're trying to say I'm wrong all the time, they're trying to say I've done all these things I haven't done, that I'm calling for violence.
[01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:45.045]  I have to sit here and show you that we know what we're talking about.
[01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:51.512]  I said a year and a half ago, Trump is ordering Sessions to go after him criminally, and he's saying he can't do that.
[01:10:51.772 --> 01:10:53.773]  When clearly he can, when it's clear and present.
[01:10:54.013 --> 01:10:57.515]  The President can't say what you're supposed to find, but he can say, I want this investigated.
[01:10:58.215 --> 01:10:59.675]  Or I want you to crack down on opiates.
[01:10:59.736 --> 01:11:01.296]  Or I want people down at the damn border.
[01:11:01.596 --> 01:11:02.457]  Or I want the U.S.
[01:11:02.537 --> 01:11:03.197]  Army to do this.
[01:11:05.218 --> 01:11:09.440]  But when you're in investigations, well, here's Sunday.
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.100]  Here's Sunday's headline for the Sunday show.
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:11.901]  Exclusive.
[01:11:11.941 --> 01:11:14.902]  Trump set to indict Hillary Clinton and other deep staters in coming months.
[01:11:17.816 --> 01:11:18.737]  And then what's out today?
[01:11:19.337 --> 01:11:26.482]  Trump shares image calling for his opponents to face trials for treason with Hillary Clinton and James Comey front and center in the image.
[01:11:26.662 --> 01:11:27.463]  Exactly who I said.
[01:11:29.164 --> 01:11:30.525]  Now I know what's going on.
[01:11:30.605 --> 01:11:33.107]  I know what the right thing to do is, but I also have sources.
[01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:38.271]  And a lot of people are scared right now.
[01:11:38.912 --> 01:11:50.380]  That's why we have guests on this show that'll say they're friends of the show and then suddenly they won't come on the show or suddenly they come on and start siding with George Soros on the air or saying Trump's bad.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:57.765]  That's all them signaling in case this goes wrong and Trump gets killed or overthrown so they don't get targeted.
[01:11:59.026 --> 01:12:04.270]  It's cover your ass type behavior and it's what's going to destroy this damn planet.
[01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:05.712]  Excuse my French.
[01:12:05.772 --> 01:12:08.093]  I mean, men have to stop acting like this crap.
[01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.236]  I know you can Machiavelli lie and cover both sides.
[01:12:11.917 --> 01:12:13.918]  That's not what men are supposed to do.
[01:12:14.399 --> 01:12:19.082]  Leadership is about really standing up for what you believe in and putting it all on the table.
[01:12:19.963 --> 01:12:21.544]  Not half measures.
[01:12:25.147 --> 01:12:27.189]  But there are just a bunch of men in this country
[01:12:29.048 --> 01:12:30.609]  That do not act like Americans.
[01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:32.451]  They do not act like Western ideology.
[01:12:32.511 --> 01:12:37.915]  They act like a pack of frat boys who think they're tough.
[01:12:38.996 --> 01:12:44.920]  And they want all the trappings of being men, but they're never really men at the end of the day because they don't have moral courage.
[01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:47.923]  And if you don't have moral courage, you don't have anything.
[01:12:50.503 --> 01:13:01.794]  The left will always try to shame you in public and get in your face and go, aha, and do all this stuff and boo at you as if you're in a restaurant and they're booing at you.
[01:13:01.834 --> 01:13:02.815]  They look like the fools.
[01:13:03.816 --> 01:13:05.217]  And they always feel stupid and walk off.
[01:13:05.638 --> 01:13:06.799]  That's because they're followers.
[01:13:06.839 --> 01:13:10.682]  That would hurt them to be in a restaurant and have people come up and boo at them.
[01:13:11.744 --> 01:13:15.087]  And you just go from that point on, do you really want to be those people?
[01:13:16.544 --> 01:13:19.126]  Where the left says, we're going to get in your face wherever you are, whatever you're doing.
[01:13:19.466 --> 01:13:20.207]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[01:13:20.967 --> 01:13:22.769]  I'm not going to wait until tomorrow to go over this.
[01:13:26.051 --> 01:13:30.335]  I'm going to cover it at six after in the third hour, because Faith Goldie's coming up a lot more.
[01:13:31.155 --> 01:13:37.020]  I'm going to cover it start of the next hour, and I'm going to do my best job to go over it.
[01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:45.271]  This is very important because I'm not just going to tell you what's going to come out in the next two weeks.
[01:13:45.412 --> 01:13:52.357]  Now, it could change, they could decide not to do it, but word is Trump's going to go ahead and let the dogs loose.
[01:13:52.517 --> 01:13:54.059]  In fact, the dogs have been told you're off the chain.
[01:13:54.739 --> 01:13:59.803]  And I already was told this two weeks ago, and you're seeing what's going on here.
[01:14:00.344 --> 01:14:02.666]  The President's tweeting that he's going to have their asses locked up.
[01:14:02.686 --> 01:14:03.806]  Okay?
[01:14:04.427 --> 01:14:05.428]  And they sure as hell deserve it.
[01:14:06.553 --> 01:14:07.274]  There's a lot more than that.
[01:14:07.314 --> 01:14:08.314]  These people are out of control.
[01:14:08.655 --> 01:14:09.535]  They don't know when to stop.
[01:14:10.236 --> 01:14:11.156]  They don't know when to back down.
[01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:11.597]  They're crazy.
[01:14:11.617 --> 01:14:12.337]  They're megalomaniacs.
[01:14:14.018 --> 01:14:16.060]  But I'm not just going to tell you what's going to happen.
[01:14:17.461 --> 01:14:19.963]  Because the time is for the enemy to know what's about to happen.
[01:14:20.143 --> 01:14:20.583]  They already know.
[01:14:21.504 --> 01:14:22.685]  That's why it's now time to tell you.
[01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:27.428]  We're also going to tell you how they're going to counter this.
[01:14:28.048 --> 01:14:29.990]  And you saw the signals the last week.
[01:14:30.530 --> 01:14:32.752]  You saw it really heat up today.
[01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.511]  With the whole Ivanka Trump thing.
[01:14:36.771 --> 01:14:37.932]  That's a little tell-tale on this.
[01:14:38.893 --> 01:14:48.419]  So, I'm going to give you all the specifics next hour, but it's reported that 18 foreign governments got into Hillary's server.
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.701]  The Pentagon, everybody knew what Hillary was doing.
[01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:53.662]  They were tapping the whole thing.
[01:14:56.364 --> 01:14:59.106]  And 17 U.S.
[01:14:59.186 --> 01:15:00.447]  agencies have the emails.
[01:15:01.748 --> 01:15:03.489]  That means the President has them for two years.
[01:15:05.598 --> 01:15:07.278]  Hillary always intended to be elected.
[01:15:07.318 --> 01:15:08.999]  She acted like she was above the law.
[01:15:09.299 --> 01:15:10.399]  Because these people are crazy.
[01:15:10.419 --> 01:15:11.039]  They think they're invincible.
[01:15:11.279 --> 01:15:14.200]  Just like psychopaths always do reckless stuff at the end.
[01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.760]  Because they want to be caught subconsciously.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.601]  They hate themselves subconsciously.
[01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:23.962]  The good that's left in them is just their physical bodies trying to kill them.
[01:15:24.902 --> 01:15:25.842]  It wants the spirit out.
[01:15:27.062 --> 01:15:30.363]  So it's like, even though they're demonically possessed, the spirit
[01:15:34.235 --> 01:15:37.476]  She's struggling in there to, like, kill the body immediately just to get the demon out.
[01:15:37.756 --> 01:15:50.521]  If you want to use a metaphysical parlance, you'd say it's the subconscious versus the conscious and the ego and the head and all that stuff, but the point is, is that all of her emails are about to get released.
[01:15:50.901 --> 01:15:51.281]  You know, the 35,000?
[01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:52.342]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.822 --> 01:15:54.382]  Yeah.
[01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:57.143]  Oh, and a bunch of other stuff about Robert Mueller.
[01:15:57.964 --> 01:15:59.544]  And Comey and all you criminals.
[01:15:59.864 --> 01:16:00.965]  Get ready, scumbags.
[01:16:03.208 --> 01:16:13.452]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:25.876]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[01:16:26.876 --> 01:16:32.180]  What if you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:33.561]  Well, that's dead naming.
[01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:41.907]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:45.469]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:48.592]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation, or borders.
[01:16:49.012 --> 01:16:51.694]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[01:16:52.154 --> 01:16:55.717]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[01:16:56.636 --> 01:16:58.577]  World War III was the Cold War.
[01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:01.639]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[01:17:02.059 --> 01:17:19.610]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[01:17:21.394 --> 01:17:24.736]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[01:17:24.756 --> 01:17:26.037]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[01:17:26.077 --> 01:17:30.379]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:35.022]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[01:17:35.762 --> 01:17:37.363]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:40.565]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[01:17:41.626 --> 01:17:42.967]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[01:17:43.047 --> 01:17:47.269]  But the good news is, around the world, people are waking up to this.
[01:17:47.809 --> 01:17:50.551]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[01:17:52.073 --> 01:17:58.163]  But the globalists are counter-striking against the independent, patriot, nationalist media like InfoWars.
[01:17:58.183 --> 01:18:02.671]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective.
[01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:05.475]  Thanks to your support, you have been the most effective.
[01:18:06.873 --> 01:18:08.115]  Exposing what's really happening.
[01:18:08.716 --> 01:18:13.021]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[01:18:13.481 --> 01:18:16.986]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[01:18:17.606 --> 01:18:21.611]  And I wanted just to remind you that employers isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[01:18:22.812 --> 01:18:23.933]  And without you, we won't be here.
[01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:28.536]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[01:18:29.736 --> 01:18:32.078]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:32.558 --> 01:18:41.323]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[01:18:41.403 --> 01:18:44.065]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[01:18:44.585 --> 01:18:45.005]  I think so.
[01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:27.642]  At InfowarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent and the revolution of funding Infowars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[01:19:28.122 --> 01:19:39.364]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American Revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[01:19:40.064 --> 01:19:41.324]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:20.493 --> 01:20:35.423]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:36.964 --> 01:20:41.768]  Coming up in the next hour, it's six after, I'm going to lay out
[01:20:43.226 --> 01:21:01.333]  Trump's counter-strike against the deep state that he signaled today with the tweet saying that there needs to be treason trials for Robert Mueller, for Hillary Clinton, for Barack Obama, for James Comey and others.
[01:21:01.393 --> 01:21:05.335]  Boy, if that isn't the shot politically heard around the world!
[01:21:06.636 --> 01:21:13.059]  There was my headline on Sunday, exclusive, Trump set to indict Hillary Clinton and other deep staters in coming months.
[01:21:13.819 --> 01:21:17.100]  Yes, the Death Star is clear to fire.
[01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:24.543]  That's all coming up, and I'm going to tell you how they're going to do it, how the deep state's going to counter.
[01:21:26.144 --> 01:21:27.904]  But that's what's so crazy about the deep state.
[01:21:27.964 --> 01:21:30.125]  Trump has them dead to rights.
[01:21:31.166 --> 01:21:31.986]  He has them.
[01:21:33.301 --> 01:21:39.143]  And he didn't want to damage the economy, he thought they'd just crawl back into their holes, but they cannot stop.
[01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:51.807]  And so we're going to give you the specifics, exclusively here, of Hillary Clinton's secret server, and where the contents are, and what is about to happen, and more!
[01:21:53.448 --> 01:21:57.049]  Next week's, next month's news, today!
[01:21:58.270 --> 01:22:01.451]  Why we're hated, why they tried to block us, why they tried to shut us down.
[01:22:02.421 --> 01:22:07.902]  You know, they said it was a referendum, the election here in the midterms a few weeks ago, on Trump.
[01:22:08.663 --> 01:22:11.523]  And we know about the fraudulent polls and all the rest of it.
[01:22:11.563 --> 01:22:19.125]  We saw massive election fraud and people voting the names of dead people, illegal aliens publicly voting, and Democrats stealing elections all over the country.
[01:22:20.005 --> 01:22:21.226]  Trump really won.
[01:22:21.406 --> 01:22:22.126]  We really won.
[01:22:22.726 --> 01:22:23.526]  And that's the sentiment.
[01:22:23.586 --> 01:22:25.347]  It's what the bots and the numbers are really showing.
[01:22:25.367 --> 01:22:26.707]  That's why the globalists are panicking.
[01:22:26.727 --> 01:22:28.467]  And all over the world, nationalists are winning.
[01:22:29.067 --> 01:22:30.788]  From Brazil to Germany to the UK.
[01:22:32.458 --> 01:22:32.898]  To Italy.
[01:22:32.918 --> 01:22:33.719]  So they don't know what to do.
[01:22:33.739 --> 01:22:36.201]  And up in Canada, though, they've really clamped down.
[01:22:36.601 --> 01:22:43.987]  And they've been saying, you know, you can't read out of the Bible scriptures about, you know, sexualization of children, or you can't do any of this.
[01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:52.434]  And then Faith Goldie, out of 30-something candidates, journalist, talk show host, she was in third place without them letting her run ads in newspapers, TV.
[01:22:52.914 --> 01:22:53.755]  She was banned.
[01:22:54.315 --> 01:22:55.516]  And she was banned from the debates.
[01:22:56.491 --> 01:22:58.471]  And she'll give us a little footnote on what happened with that.
[01:22:58.491 --> 01:22:59.232]  But she didn't lose.
[01:22:59.552 --> 01:23:00.032]  She ran.
[01:23:00.612 --> 01:23:04.413]  They had to block her, but she injected reality and she fought back.
[01:23:04.473 --> 01:23:06.893]  And I tell you, Canada is really ready to awaken.
[01:23:07.173 --> 01:23:16.595]  But I wanted to get her on about the invasion of our borders, how Canada's wide open internationally to globalists, what she sees coming next, the attack on the West.
[01:23:16.615 --> 01:23:23.076]  And then I'm going to get into the most over-the-top video ever in the last segment of this hour.
[01:23:23.096 --> 01:23:25.777]  The video's on Infowars.com.
[01:23:28.297 --> 01:23:39.929]  At city council meetings all over the country there's battles going on where the so-called transgenders come and demand access to your five-year-old children for quote, grooming.
[01:23:42.371 --> 01:23:44.713]  Now you heard me use the pedophile term grooming.
[01:23:47.316 --> 01:23:51.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be playing all of this.
[01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:53.270]  Coming up.
[01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:57.031]  But the establishment is making its move on our children.
[01:23:57.351 --> 01:24:03.113]  Faith Goldie, faithfortoronto.ca, still a great website, at Faith Goldie on Twitter.
[01:24:03.873 --> 01:24:08.414]  And of course, she's worked with a lot of other great folks like Laura Southern and others at The Rebel.
[01:24:09.514 --> 01:24:10.955]  And she's freelancing right now.
[01:24:11.435 --> 01:24:12.975]  Faith, thanks for coming on with us today.
[01:24:13.075 --> 01:24:13.715]  It's great to see you.
[01:24:14.736 --> 01:24:15.956]  Thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[01:24:16.849 --> 01:24:17.870]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:27.060]  I mean, obviously, you're big on borders, the attack on the West, the globalist alliance with Islam, the EU saying they're going to ban, and so will the UK, any criticism of Islam.
[01:24:27.481 --> 01:24:33.788]  They're saying they won't let Christian refugees in because it might offend from countries where Muslims are killing them, like Pakistan, because it might offend the Muslims.
[01:24:33.808 --> 01:24:34.709]  I mean, this is amazing.
[01:24:36.021 --> 01:24:36.721]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:24:36.761 --> 01:24:49.804]  Look, if you're giving me my pick of the litter here, then definitely the UN Migrant Compact, or as I have nicknamed it, the UN Suicide Pact of Nations, is where all of my attention is right now.
[01:24:50.204 --> 01:24:53.945]  This is really where the globalists have brought the battle lines.
[01:24:54.025 --> 01:25:04.687]  They have seen the nationalistic wins everywhere from Donald Trump in America, to Brazil, to certain pockets of Europe as well, with we see Salvini in Italy, etc.
[01:25:05.367 --> 01:25:07.289]  And they're saying to hell with the ballot box.
[01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:09.052]  It takes too much work.
[01:25:09.092 --> 01:25:11.414]  It takes too much money to rig all of the elections.
[01:25:11.454 --> 01:25:13.577]  We can't pull the wool over everyone's eyes.
[01:25:13.917 --> 01:25:20.165]  So what they're doing now is that they're injecting legislation through international
[01:25:20.834 --> 01:25:24.155]  ...nationalist bodies, namely the United Nations in this case.
[01:25:24.456 --> 01:25:34.480]  So they have come up with this migrant compact, which almost all 193 UN member states, just shy of I think seven of them now, have said they're not going to sign.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.681]  But the rest of them are fully on board.
[01:25:37.041 --> 01:25:45.705]  And what this does, Alex, is that it makes migration from anywhere in the world, for any reason, to anywhere in the world,
[01:25:46.005 --> 01:25:46.806]  At any time.
[01:25:46.826 --> 01:25:48.748]  A human right.
[01:25:49.168 --> 01:25:50.149]  That's exactly right.
[01:25:50.269 --> 01:25:55.614]  And no one in the face of the planet was asked if we wanted this.
[01:25:56.035 --> 01:26:09.828]  And yet our elected officials are butting up with unelected, unaccountable globalists and injecting an open border suicide pact into our national legislatures without our consent.
[01:26:10.228 --> 01:26:10.448]  Wow.
[01:26:10.929 --> 01:26:12.970]  I mean, this is exactly what's happening.
[01:26:13.290 --> 01:26:14.391]  It's cut-and-dry treason.
[01:26:15.512 --> 01:26:16.633]  It's reverse colonialism.
[01:26:16.653 --> 01:26:20.316]  And then we're supposed to pay for all of it as well.
[01:26:20.396 --> 01:26:24.019]  Faith Goldie is obviously on fire today, breaking all this down.
[01:26:24.059 --> 01:26:28.362]  And now the EU is forming its own military to not let nation-states leave.
[01:26:28.462 --> 01:26:33.206]  I mean, this is 100% authoritarianism, a replay of World War II.
[01:26:33.426 --> 01:26:35.948]  Oh, and who came up with the plan for the EU first?
[01:26:37.797 --> 01:26:39.279]  Yeah, well, absolutely.
[01:26:39.739 --> 01:26:43.042]  It was always going to be the greater Deutschmark, okay?
[01:26:43.102 --> 01:26:48.067]  Look, at the end of the day, we know why they were edging towards this globalist world order.
[01:26:48.228 --> 01:26:55.275]  So that way, together, the sum of their parts could be larger than any one group of patriots within any particular nation.
[01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:56.316]  But really, this is
[01:26:56.776 --> 01:27:02.360]  A fight of ideas that transcends our national borders because they're coming for each one of our nations.
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.222]  And Alex, you're 100% right in saying that we're ultimately the ones who are going to have to pay for it.
[01:27:07.503 --> 01:27:13.406]  We're going to have to pay for it, not just demographically with the changes we're going to sustain, but sociologically, economically.
[01:27:13.706 --> 01:27:21.131]  Part of this compact, out of the gates, is that our nations are to promote and advertise our newly opened borders.
[01:27:21.591 --> 01:27:35.046]  Once these people decide that they want to come to our nation because we've got the greatest welfare systems, that's literally what we have to advertise, that our nations that have to pay for their reduced risk journeys to our welfare state.
[01:27:35.066 --> 01:27:40.292]  So that looks like things like land transfers, that looks like things like different sorts of perhaps better equipped
[01:27:40.632 --> 01:27:44.913]  Sea vessels and the dinghies we've been seeing North Africans take to cross the Mediterranean.
[01:27:45.233 --> 01:27:50.134]  And then once they actually land on our shores, Alex, the job doesn't end there!
[01:27:50.514 --> 01:28:07.417]  We're expected to give them work permits, residence permits, job permits, not to mention information on how to acquire free education and healthcare in a socialized state like mine, where my relatives, my ancestors, have been paying into a socialized healthcare system
[01:28:07.857 --> 01:28:11.159]  For decades, that means a lot of trouble.
[01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:17.264]  We already know that we've got folks who are coming into our country with things like tuberculosis, with stage 4 cancer.
[01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:26.190]  So when you have a socialized health care system, that means people like my late mother are moved further and further and further down the queue because, well, guess what?
[01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:31.193]  We've got to make sure that we prioritize all of the different migrants.
[01:28:31.614 --> 01:28:34.996]  And while all of this is happening, we are informing the migrants
[01:28:35.536 --> 01:28:38.597]  Of their new rights in the jackpot land that they have.
[01:28:38.617 --> 01:28:41.719]  Oh, that's what's incredible, where they'll bitch about the food and complain.
[01:28:41.739 --> 01:28:46.881]  When we come back, I'll play the video that I didn't get to yesterday, where you've got the guy in Germany bragging, ha, there's no Germans in Germany.
[01:28:47.261 --> 01:28:49.522]  The only ones who are there are working to pay for my welfare.
[01:28:49.642 --> 01:28:50.183]  Ah, ha, ha.
[01:28:50.603 --> 01:28:53.444]  It is just so insane how cucked we are.
[01:28:53.804 --> 01:28:58.846]  Faith Goldie is our guest, talk show host from Canada, straight ahead to break it all down.
[01:28:59.106 --> 01:28:59.987]  Share those live links.
[01:29:02.259 --> 01:29:08.000]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:29:08.301 --> 01:29:12.322]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:29:12.762 --> 01:29:14.962]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:29:15.002 --> 01:29:17.123]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:29:17.463 --> 01:29:19.463]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:29:19.983 --> 01:29:20.244]  Boom!
[01:29:20.524 --> 01:29:22.764]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:29:23.104 --> 01:29:24.685]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:29:24.745 --> 01:29:26.565]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[01:29:26.605 --> 01:29:27.745]  You still have a shopfront.
[01:29:27.925 --> 01:29:28.726]  And then what do we see?
[01:29:29.006 --> 01:29:29.766]  Washington Post.
[01:29:30.306 --> 01:29:33.448]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%.
[01:29:34.809 --> 01:29:37.931]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:29:37.951 --> 01:29:40.773]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:29:41.093 --> 01:29:46.497]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:46.817 --> 01:29:53.802]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[01:29:54.142 --> 01:29:57.544]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN is.
[01:29:57.805 --> 01:30:00.026]  We're only funded by you by getting the products
[01:30:00.186 --> 01:30:10.819]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:30:19.048 --> 01:30:21.829]  So it's a long way to the top if you want to keep this country free.
[01:30:22.309 --> 01:30:27.431]  And that's why I love Ted Nugent, especially getting to meet him in person and spend some time with him a few times over the years.
[01:30:27.511 --> 01:30:32.173]  You can feel the energy, you can feel the spirit, and it's the spirit of America.
[01:30:32.253 --> 01:30:33.734]  Ted Nugent, what do we do about him?
[01:30:33.754 --> 01:30:37.315]  You just heard that chant, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:30:37.655 --> 01:30:44.698]  I say literally, you are against the country existing, that isn't free speech, get your ass out of here, you're a damn enemy.
[01:30:44.838 --> 01:30:50.101]  Well, let me see if I can take a deep breath here after getting the wind knocked out of me.
[01:30:50.141 --> 01:30:55.404]  Have you ever noticed that it's the Democrats who want to give away free stuff to everyone who will vote for them?
[01:30:55.424 --> 01:31:00.467]  As if there is an endless pile of taxpayer dollars from which to plunder.
[01:31:01.067 --> 01:31:07.712]  Does the Democrats' free stuff mantra make you think back to when your parents told you that nothing is free?
[01:31:07.732 --> 01:31:10.934]  Do you wonder how and who is going to pay for all this free stuff?
[01:31:11.154 --> 01:31:15.698]  Should Starbucks be forced to provide a free cup of coffee every morning to those who don't have any money?
[01:31:15.858 --> 01:31:23.924]  I just want to know when the fedzilla gravy train of waste and torch tax dollars ends and personal responsibility begins.
[01:31:24.324 --> 01:31:31.330]  Remember that the government that is big enough to give you everything is the government that is big enough to take away everything that you have.
[01:31:31.690 --> 01:31:36.534]  And that's what the zombies and the brainwashed propaganda ministry left.
[01:31:36.994 --> 01:31:38.695]  Zombies don't get.
[01:31:38.775 --> 01:31:49.804]  So those of us that do know that rugged individualism is what is the foundation of the American dream of independence and being the best that you can be, we better raise more hell
[01:31:50.224 --> 01:31:55.468]  We better get more Republicans in our families, in our workforce, in churches, in school, in the deer camp.
[01:31:55.769 --> 01:31:57.470]  We need to raise more hell.
[01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:08.619]  We need to shout from the mountaintop of our everyday lives what the Constitution, the Bill of Rights identifies and outlines, and start demanding that kind of accountability from our elected employees.
[01:32:08.859 --> 01:32:11.361]  Yeah, bottom line is, if you believe enough,
[01:32:12.021 --> 01:32:19.787]  In the American dream, and you choose your own path in life, and you do the best that you can do.
[01:32:20.007 --> 01:32:23.009]  If you believe in that, you can't just do it unto yourself.
[01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:25.150]  You have to demand that from everyone around you.
[01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:39.160]  And when you see slovenly behavior, when you see liberal denial, and fake news, and political correct scourge, when you see it, you can't just walk away and shrug your shoulders and go, oh well, nothing I can do.
[01:32:39.500 --> 01:32:41.261]  Well, there is something you can do.
[01:32:41.561 --> 01:32:44.562]  We need to be firm and confrontational.
[01:32:44.602 --> 01:32:48.924]  The only politics that matter are confrontational politics.
[01:32:48.964 --> 01:32:50.205]  Ted Nugent, you are awesome.
[01:32:50.265 --> 01:32:51.925]  The album comes out in two days.
[01:32:51.945 --> 01:32:53.026]  The music made me do it.
[01:32:53.086 --> 01:32:54.747]  I'm gonna be getting it at tednugent.com.
[01:32:54.847 --> 01:32:55.367]  God bless you.
[01:32:55.387 --> 01:32:57.648]  We'll keep fighting, and we'll talk to you very soon, sir.
[01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:09.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:20.303]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:21.264 --> 01:33:25.207]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:27.909 --> 01:33:29.931]  Live, from Canada.
[01:33:31.827 --> 01:33:39.134]  Coming to you live from the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[01:33:39.794 --> 01:33:41.816]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:42.037 --> 01:33:46.360]  That's right, and Faith Goldie of faithgoldie.ca is our guest.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:47.762]  A little bit in the next hour.
[01:33:47.782 --> 01:33:48.963]  Appreciate her joining us.
[01:33:49.063 --> 01:33:53.287]  And then I am going to get into the next phase of Trump.
[01:33:53.707 --> 01:34:00.649]  Preparing to make his move on Hillary and the deep state and that is some huge news that will get Faith Goldie's take on here in just a moment.
[01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:02.730]  You cannot underestimate how massive this is.
[01:34:03.210 --> 01:34:08.212]  This is going to be huge what I'm going to be covering coming up in the next hour.
[01:34:09.652 --> 01:34:20.696]  It's one of the biggest things I've ever covered and it's exclusive and it ties into Trump sharing image calling for his opponents to face trials for treason.
[01:34:21.863 --> 01:34:24.325]  So that image is up at DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com.
[01:34:24.966 --> 01:34:27.609]  Listen, I get so busy covering the news that I'm our biggest problem.
[01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:30.812]  I plugged for one minute last hour.
[01:34:31.052 --> 01:34:33.174]  Most talk show hosts plug a minute every segment.
[01:34:33.655 --> 01:34:34.495]  Products and sponsors.
[01:34:34.615 --> 01:34:35.116]  I don't do that.
[01:34:36.717 --> 01:34:45.226]  But we're funded by you buying water filtration, air filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, high quality supplements, high quality films and books and preparedness gear.
[01:34:46.912 --> 01:34:54.370]  And because they've been trying to take our payment processors and shut us down, my answer to that was the biggest sales ever in the last few months to sell all inventory out by the end of the year.
[01:34:55.702 --> 01:34:56.923]  Because we have inventory tax and things.
[01:34:56.943 --> 01:34:59.544]  But this year, I usually keep enough to have some stuff into the new year.
[01:35:00.184 --> 01:35:01.905]  We're not going to have very much at the start of the new year.
[01:35:02.045 --> 01:35:03.046]  I'm trying to sell everything.
[01:35:03.346 --> 01:35:08.328]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off on the supplements, up to 75% off on everything else.
[01:35:08.969 --> 01:35:11.570]  A lot of this stuff is lost liters that were just everything must go.
[01:35:12.250 --> 01:35:13.911]  Water filtration is at a 249.
[01:35:13.951 --> 01:35:16.532]  The Alexa Pure Pro, amazing gravity filter system, it's 127.
[01:35:17.353 --> 01:35:19.574]  Usually at 200, it's an absolute steal.
[01:35:20.054 --> 01:35:22.956]  But that's because, again, they ordered too much of these.
[01:35:23.697 --> 01:35:24.858]  This is directly from the factory.
[01:35:25.178 --> 01:35:29.342]  We've been given authorization from the factory to sell these until they're all sold out.
[01:35:29.362 --> 01:35:31.363]  At this rate, we're talking a couple days max.
[01:35:31.383 --> 01:35:35.107]  We're going to have to get rid of this special because that's going to be it.
[01:35:35.127 --> 01:35:36.428]  They're going to be sold out.
[01:35:36.768 --> 01:35:37.729]  So take advantage of that.
[01:35:37.789 --> 01:35:38.369]  Get it as a gift.
[01:35:38.409 --> 01:35:40.571]  Do your Christmas shopping at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:35:41.872 --> 01:35:42.912]  Don't battle the crowds.
[01:35:42.952 --> 01:35:47.513]  Don't go pay for overpriced crap at Target, you know, that funds the whole globalist program.
[01:35:48.093 --> 01:35:55.555]  Support InfoWars that isn't afraid to say the word Christmas and give the gift of a water filtration system or an air purification system from Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:57.095]  It's 200-something bucks.
[01:35:57.135 --> 01:35:58.235]  Leading competitors aren't even as good.
[01:35:58.255 --> 01:35:58.835]  500 bucks.
[01:35:59.636 --> 01:36:01.756]  Get the super high quality, fresh, durable food.
[01:36:01.796 --> 01:36:02.596]  Lasts 25 years.
[01:36:03.336 --> 01:36:04.857]  50% off at the end of the year.
[01:36:05.197 --> 01:36:08.457]  They are selling out of their entire inventory that just got packaged a few months ago.
[01:36:09.017 --> 01:36:11.438]  That is from My Patriot Supply, the same folks that designed
[01:36:11.778 --> 01:36:12.618]  The Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:36:13.178 --> 01:36:14.519]  This is the biggest sell ever.
[01:36:14.579 --> 01:36:15.199]  Free shipping.
[01:36:15.879 --> 01:36:16.800]  50 to 75% off.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:19.060]  Double Patriot points on your future order.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.361]  Normally 5 points.
[01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:21.581]  5 cents on every dollar.
[01:36:21.621 --> 01:36:22.781]  It's 10 cents on every dollar now.
[01:36:23.141 --> 01:36:24.982]  This is, without a doubt, biggest sell ever.
[01:36:25.342 --> 01:36:26.482]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:36:26.562 --> 01:36:27.183]  Cyber Week.
[01:36:28.063 --> 01:36:30.464]  And all these deals will stay there until at least Sunday.
[01:36:30.844 --> 01:36:32.464]  Except if things are about to sell out.
[01:36:33.144 --> 01:36:41.147]  Then if stuff isn't coming in for, you know, two, three more months, then we'll have to go back to regular retail once we get down to just a few hundred bottles of this or a few hundred t-shirts of that.
[01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:46.626]  One of the biggest things you can do is you can go get the t-shirts.
[01:36:47.087 --> 01:36:48.027]  It's choose your adventure.
[01:36:48.067 --> 01:36:52.291]  You wear a big old red InfoWars shirt in a right-wing area, you'll get carried on people's shoulders.
[01:36:52.711 --> 01:36:54.292]  Might meet your wife or husband or whatever.
[01:36:55.153 --> 01:36:58.675]  But you wear that in a blue state area, you might get hit in the head with a bike lock.
[01:36:58.695 --> 01:36:59.356]  And I'm serious.
[01:36:59.416 --> 01:37:00.397]  Or hot coffee thrown on you.
[01:37:01.254 --> 01:37:02.335]  You want to experience what it's like to be me?
[01:37:02.475 --> 01:37:02.715]  Do it!
[01:37:03.195 --> 01:37:04.216]  Or wear a Molon Labe.
[01:37:04.276 --> 01:37:05.437]  Leftists don't speak Latin.
[01:37:05.457 --> 01:37:06.838]  They'll just think it's a Spartan helmet.
[01:37:07.218 --> 01:37:08.719]  We've got clothes for men, clothes for women.
[01:37:08.759 --> 01:37:10.180]  We've got the whole George Washington line.
[01:37:10.580 --> 01:37:15.463]  We've got Trump as, we're talking about triggering, cutting the head off of Medusa.
[01:37:15.483 --> 01:37:16.304]  That happens to be Hillary.
[01:37:16.744 --> 01:37:18.505]  It's all there at infowarestore.com.
[01:37:18.525 --> 01:37:20.026]  So get your t-shirt today.
[01:37:20.106 --> 01:37:20.827]  Give it as a gift.
[01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:21.667]  Ball caps, you name it.
[01:37:22.067 --> 01:37:23.008]  Back to Faith Goldie.
[01:37:23.048 --> 01:37:25.410]  Faithgoldie.ca and her great work.
[01:37:26.411 --> 01:37:35.443]  Back into the whole Islamic invasion, how the left's allied with it, and the cucking, the arrogance of this, and how it's like the bottom has just dropped out of reality.
[01:37:36.867 --> 01:37:45.332]  What I find amazing is that center-right and, let's say, harder-right folks can't manage to ally themselves to defeat the globalists.
[01:37:45.712 --> 01:37:58.499]  And yet you have the far-LGBT and alt-left allying with Islamofascism, which essentially wants them all dead, to establish their own ends, which is globalism for one.
[01:37:59.279 --> 01:38:08.085]  Global caliphate for the other, but ultimately it's to do away with the Christian nation state that we see across most of the Western civilized world.
[01:38:08.626 --> 01:38:14.029]  As for Canada, my home and native land, we have already passed something called Motion 103.
[01:38:14.349 --> 01:38:28.239]  This brings into law, in effect, du jour, Islamo-Sharia law, where we have a, quote, whole of government approach to, quote, eliminating Islamophobia.
[01:38:28.379 --> 01:38:31.701]  Where we don't even try to define what Islamophobia means.
[01:38:31.721 --> 01:38:33.662]  But we know that Sharia law will help.
[01:38:33.942 --> 01:38:39.945]  If you make fun of Muhammad, if you draw a cartoon of him, there are all sorts of evils that can befall you.
[01:38:40.346 --> 01:38:42.127]  And, I mean, where do we draw the line?
[01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:48.710]  Should we say that a woman, in fact, needs four, you know, witnesses to be able to make rape allegations?
[01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:52.092]  The sort of thing that's increasing more and more day by day.
[01:38:52.132 --> 01:38:53.853]  And by the way, Faith, I have three daughters.
[01:38:53.873 --> 01:38:57.135]  I am Islamic sexual mutilation.
[01:38:57.455 --> 01:38:58.535]  Having their genitals cut off.
[01:38:58.595 --> 01:38:59.376]  Very phobic of that.
[01:38:59.716 --> 01:39:01.756]  I'm phobic of gay people being thrown off buildings.
[01:39:02.537 --> 01:39:06.958]  I am phobic of the horrible third world conditions these people are in.
[01:39:07.218 --> 01:39:10.879]  I'm phobic on how about 80% of Islamic men in the West are on welfare and never work.
[01:39:11.119 --> 01:39:14.080]  And walk around in their nightgowns all day stinking, bitching at everyone.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:25.204]  Your bet, I am absolutely phobic of them and the gang raping and the making fun of people and the migrant jokes about there being no Germans left in Germany except for those working to pay for his welfare.
[01:39:26.474 --> 01:39:34.657]  Yeah, I just saw a report out of Sweden, an official government report, that one third of the young women there have now undergone some sort of sexual abuse.
[01:39:34.697 --> 01:39:39.799]  This is, of course, not just correlated, it's caused by the migrant invasion there.
[01:39:40.079 --> 01:39:44.481]  We are literally sacrificing our young, specifically our women and our children.
[01:39:45.201 --> 01:39:51.723]  These are two groups that Western, frankly, men used to put up on a pedestal and died to protect.
[01:39:51.943 --> 01:39:58.404]  But now we're putting our women and our children on the altar and sacrificing them in the name of political correctness.
[01:39:58.724 --> 01:40:03.106]  We are more afraid of being called Islamophobic than we are of Islamic terrorism.
[01:40:03.366 --> 01:40:08.807]  We are more afraid of being called Islamophobic than having our daughters being raped by
[01:40:09.607 --> 01:40:10.067]  Exactly.
[01:40:10.107 --> 01:40:13.809]  We know the enemy corporate media gangs up on anybody that stands up for reality.
[01:40:13.829 --> 01:40:18.130]  When we come back, you're an expert, not in journalism, about the sexualization of children, the grooming of it.
[01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:22.112]  The left now admits they're grooming children to be sexually sterilized.
[01:40:22.152 --> 01:40:26.733]  In the UK, as you know, some schools, elementary's 30% are already opting in to be sterilized.
[01:40:26.994 --> 01:40:29.554]  This is the most massive eugenic story ever.
[01:40:29.594 --> 01:40:30.735]  But speaking of the devil,
[01:40:31.055 --> 01:40:33.137]  It's an Infowars.com report from yesterday.
[01:40:33.217 --> 01:40:34.438]  Everyone should share this video.
[01:40:34.938 --> 01:40:35.319]  Video.
[01:40:35.379 --> 01:40:36.180]  Migrant jokes.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:39.262]  Invader jokes about there being no Germans left in Germany.
[01:40:39.282 --> 01:40:39.923]  And he goes further.
[01:40:40.283 --> 01:40:43.846]  He laughs and says, all of them are busy working to pay for us.
[01:40:44.747 --> 01:40:49.631]  Over 80 percent, after five years of being in the country, have no job and don't want them.
[01:40:50.212 --> 01:40:55.597]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the horrible face of the cucking of the West.
[01:40:55.797 --> 01:40:56.397]  Let's go to the video.
[01:41:02.783 --> 01:41:07.810]  An African asylum seeker, a black guy, is walking around the city of Nuremberg.
[01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:12.756]  He talks to the first person he sees and says, thank you for taking me in.
[01:41:12.796 --> 01:41:18.103]  That I may live here for having my health insurance, a place to live, food, and everything else.
[01:41:18.183 --> 01:41:20.126]  That person says, I'm not German, I'm Albanian.
[01:41:20.945 --> 01:41:21.565]  It's a Muslim.
[01:41:21.585 --> 01:41:22.886]  The African says, oh, excuse me.
[01:41:23.246 --> 01:41:25.046]  He continues walking and speaks to the next person.
[01:41:25.066 --> 01:41:25.687]  He says, thank you.
[01:41:26.687 --> 01:41:27.527]  I may live in Germany.
[01:41:27.587 --> 01:41:29.068]  Thank you for everything that you've done for me.
[01:41:29.348 --> 01:41:29.808]  Excuse me.
[01:41:30.148 --> 01:41:30.668]  I'm not German.
[01:41:30.688 --> 01:41:31.188]  I'm Turkish.
[01:41:31.488 --> 01:41:32.729]  The African says, oh, excuse me.
[01:41:33.869 --> 01:41:35.650]  He continues walking and speaks to the next person.
[01:41:35.670 --> 01:41:39.871]  He says, thank you for allowing me to live in Germany, though you took me in as a refugee.
[01:41:39.891 --> 01:41:41.452]  He says, I'm not German.
[01:41:41.472 --> 01:41:41.972]  I'm Arab.
[01:41:42.292 --> 01:41:44.193]  The African asks, where are all the Germans?
[01:41:44.753 --> 01:41:47.974]  The Arab looks and watches and says, probably all working.
[01:41:53.099 --> 01:41:58.346]  And the judges in Germany and Sweden, they're all ruling that they're allowed to rape nine-year-old girls.
[01:41:58.386 --> 01:41:58.987]  This is in the news.
[01:41:59.027 --> 01:42:00.649]  They say, you are allowed to rape.
[01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:02.331]  You're allowed to crap in the pool.
[01:42:02.592 --> 01:42:05.676]  I mean, this is literally the invasion of inbred retards.
[01:42:07.278 --> 01:42:09.979]  You import the third world, you become the third world.
[01:42:10.379 --> 01:42:17.040]  I don't know about you, but that video I find particularly just, oh, it boils my blood, Alex.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:23.922]  This guy is not only admitting to the fact that we are fools, he's doing so, so brazenly.
[01:42:23.962 --> 01:42:27.082]  And you know, you talked about sort of this forced sterilization, etc.
[01:42:27.482 --> 01:42:32.904]  People in Western society today are not just sterilizing themselves biologically, but intellectually as well.
[01:42:32.984 --> 01:42:34.544]  I saw a report out
[01:42:34.984 --> 01:42:39.125]  French women say that they would rather import migrants than have children.
[01:42:39.465 --> 01:42:41.585]  So perhaps we're getting the future that we all deserve.
[01:42:41.625 --> 01:42:43.206]  We need our heads checked, Alex.
[01:42:43.606 --> 01:42:48.927]  They're committing suicide because they have existential guilt about perceived superiority.
[01:42:48.987 --> 01:42:54.168]  And then those coming in have existential envy, which the left is playing on.
[01:42:54.208 --> 01:43:00.789]  And so instead of adopting, in many ways, a superior culture, everyone is trying to flush it because the superiority is embarrassing.
[01:43:02.836 --> 01:43:13.067]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[01:43:13.467 --> 01:43:25.519]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[01:43:26.540 --> 01:43:31.801]  Or do you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[01:43:32.021 --> 01:43:33.281]  Well, that's dead naming.
[01:43:33.481 --> 01:43:41.523]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[01:43:41.883 --> 01:43:45.063]  Then they say it's racist to say, no, that it's okay to be white.
[01:43:45.403 --> 01:43:47.444]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation.
[01:43:47.584 --> 01:43:48.184]  We're borders.
[01:43:48.624 --> 01:43:51.304]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[01:43:51.744 --> 01:43:55.305]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[01:43:56.243 --> 01:43:58.184]  World War III was the Cold War.
[01:43:59.564 --> 01:44:01.264]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[01:44:01.664 --> 01:44:19.249]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[01:44:21.016 --> 01:44:24.359]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[01:44:24.379 --> 01:44:25.660]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[01:44:25.700 --> 01:44:30.023]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[01:44:30.584 --> 01:44:34.627]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[01:44:35.387 --> 01:44:36.989]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[01:44:37.449 --> 01:44:40.191]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[01:44:41.232 --> 01:44:42.573]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[01:44:42.653 --> 01:44:46.876]  But the good news is, around the world people are waking up to this.
[01:44:47.417 --> 01:44:50.179]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[01:44:51.698 --> 01:44:57.781]  But the globalists are counter-striking against the independent, patriot, nationalist media like InfoWars.
[01:44:57.822 --> 01:45:02.264]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective.
[01:45:02.304 --> 01:45:05.066]  Thanks to your support, you have been the most effective.
[01:45:06.195 --> 01:45:07.737]  At exposing what's really happening.
[01:45:08.338 --> 01:45:12.644]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[01:45:13.104 --> 01:45:16.589]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:21.215]  And I wanted just to remind you that InfoWars isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[01:45:22.436 --> 01:45:23.557]  And without you, we won't be here.
[01:45:24.157 --> 01:45:28.159]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[01:45:29.359 --> 01:45:31.700]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:40.864]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[01:45:40.944 --> 01:45:43.605]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[01:45:44.125 --> 01:45:44.566]  I think so.
[01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:02.188]  I think?
[01:46:20.237 --> 01:46:20.457]  Of course.
[01:46:42.970 --> 01:46:49.775]  This is pure, total, absolute evil, and InfoWars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[01:46:50.075 --> 01:46:54.157]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny, and we will fight until the end.
[01:46:54.578 --> 01:46:56.859]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[01:46:56.919 --> 01:46:59.041]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[01:46:59.441 --> 01:47:00.582]  And thank you all for your support.
[01:47:00.802 --> 01:47:01.262]  God bless you.
[01:47:06.245 --> 01:47:08.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.175 --> 01:47:20.755]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:21.096 --> 01:47:27.377]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:41.461 --> 01:47:42.762]  Faith Goldie is our guest.
[01:47:43.622 --> 01:47:46.903]  And then coming up at 6 after, I'm gonna lay on you.
[01:47:48.911 --> 01:47:49.832]  Trump's counter-strike.
[01:47:50.753 --> 01:47:52.295]  Now the globalists know this is coming.
[01:47:52.855 --> 01:47:54.337]  That's why I've been authorized to tell you this.
[01:47:55.839 --> 01:47:58.362]  And it's a little bit more than just being authorized.
[01:47:59.663 --> 01:48:03.687]  I think everybody's kind of figured out that InfoWars doesn't call the shots.
[01:48:04.348 --> 01:48:05.529]  InfoWars has a seat at the table.
[01:48:08.669 --> 01:48:11.290]  We can see the tea leaves, and we can see what needs to be done.
[01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:14.611]  Let's just say there's a kind of an ether, and we're synced up with the President.
[01:48:14.951 --> 01:48:16.451]  The enemy already noticed that a few years ago.
[01:48:16.471 --> 01:48:18.112]  That's what scares them so much.
[01:48:19.072 --> 01:48:23.594]  So, we're going to be laying out the counter-strike that Trump just put out today.
[01:48:23.654 --> 01:48:24.774]  I told you Sunday it was coming.
[01:48:24.794 --> 01:48:34.377]  In the next few months, I said you'd start seeing rumblings this week, and I've now talked to a lot of sources in the FBI, in the Pentagon, in journalism, at the White House.
[01:48:34.897 --> 01:48:37.758]  Obviously, Roger Stone has a lot of sources, and Trump.
[01:48:38.938 --> 01:48:41.299]  is taking the gloves off.
[01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.160]  It's done.
[01:48:43.341 --> 01:48:44.321]  And he wants them to know, too.
[01:48:45.262 --> 01:48:46.662]  At the Pentagon, everybody's been told.
[01:48:47.563 --> 01:48:49.144]  Well, I'm gonna get to it coming up.
[01:48:49.424 --> 01:48:50.304]  Faith Goldie's with us here.
[01:48:50.324 --> 01:48:50.845]  She's amazing.
[01:48:50.865 --> 01:48:52.285]  I want to get her on a lot more often.
[01:48:52.305 --> 01:48:53.046]  She's over in Prague.
[01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:55.887]  She just is getting married tomorrow.
[01:48:55.907 --> 01:48:56.508]  Very exciting.
[01:48:57.208 --> 01:49:03.972]  But before we go any further, since we mentioned all this, she got into politics as an award-winning journalist.
[01:49:05.812 --> 01:49:09.594]  By word of will hundreds of millions of views on our videos over the sexualization of children.
[01:49:10.154 --> 01:49:15.356]  And the UN is caught running giant child kidnapping rings and sex rings kidnapping women everywhere.
[01:49:15.716 --> 01:49:20.218]  From Haiti to Bosnia to Greece to England to the US.
[01:49:20.658 --> 01:49:21.339]  It's their business.
[01:49:22.099 --> 01:49:23.159]  They have diplomatic immunity.
[01:49:23.239 --> 01:49:26.461]  They can smuggle people, women, kids, drugs, diamonds.
[01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:31.603]  And they're running the migrant caravans that they admit have hundreds of kidnapped kids in them.
[01:49:31.883 --> 01:49:34.404]  Even the Washington Post admits a lot of them ended up in sex trafficking.
[01:49:36.519 --> 01:49:38.261]  Meanwhile, they call it drag queens.
[01:49:38.381 --> 01:49:39.262]  It's not drag queens.
[01:49:39.802 --> 01:49:40.703]  It's from Europe to here.
[01:49:40.843 --> 01:49:43.165]  Guys dress up like vampires in scary-ass outfits.
[01:49:43.686 --> 01:49:45.748]  They go into five-year-olds to traumatize them.
[01:49:46.108 --> 01:49:48.811]  They tell them, little boys are really girls, little girls are really boys.
[01:49:50.092 --> 01:49:56.538]  And it is a sexualization program and grooming of children into the LGBT community.
[01:49:56.778 --> 01:49:59.321]  Well, now more and more they're having city council battles.
[01:49:59.541 --> 01:50:00.282]  How dare you?
[01:50:01.329 --> 01:50:07.336]  And fathers are having their kids taken because the mother and the school wants the kid to be sterilized at age six and all of this.
[01:50:07.356 --> 01:50:07.836]  Well, here it is.
[01:50:08.257 --> 01:50:12.922]  Drag Queen admits he's grooming children at story hour events.
[01:50:13.342 --> 01:50:14.323]  Lafayette, Louisiana.
[01:50:14.343 --> 01:50:15.304]  This is Louisiana!
[01:50:15.324 --> 01:50:16.926]  Conservative Bible Belt!
[01:50:17.627 --> 01:50:18.508]  And they get up and say,
[01:50:20.427 --> 01:50:21.548]  We're grooming them.
[01:50:21.909 --> 01:50:22.970]  We're grooming them.
[01:50:22.990 --> 01:50:25.133]  And all these publications are praising it.
[01:50:25.173 --> 01:50:28.516]  And they have giant child kidnapping rings in England that turned out to be real.
[01:50:28.556 --> 01:50:30.519]  And then people are prosecuted that exposed it.
[01:50:30.779 --> 01:50:33.402]  Because this is the religion of the corrupt Vatican.
[01:50:34.103 --> 01:50:36.225]  It's the religion of all these instances.
[01:50:36.305 --> 01:50:37.347]  It's pedophilia, folks.
[01:50:37.627 --> 01:50:39.369]  Now, are all these drag queens into that?
[01:50:39.449 --> 01:50:39.549]  No.
[01:50:40.370 --> 01:50:42.612]  They're kind of the ambassador of this.
[01:50:43.092 --> 01:50:43.953]  The Renfield of it.
[01:50:44.013 --> 01:50:44.653]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:50:45.134 --> 01:50:50.498]  The point is, if a man walked up to your children in a nice suit and talked about their sexuality, they get arrested.
[01:50:50.738 --> 01:50:54.701]  But if you're dressed like a clown in the school, a lot of times parents aren't told, then it's okay.
[01:50:54.741 --> 01:50:55.541]  We're going to Faith Goldie.
[01:50:55.762 --> 01:50:57.363]  But here is the shocking clip.
[01:50:57.423 --> 01:50:58.824]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:06.428]  I think that the true misunderstanding of what this event is supposed to be and what me dressing up in drag for it is going to be.
[01:51:06.449 --> 01:51:09.392]  I am not there to push any kind of agenda.
[01:51:09.593 --> 01:51:14.079]  I was told at the library council meeting last night that I'm pushing the trans agenda.
[01:51:14.159 --> 01:51:15.060]  I'm pushing an overly
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:15.320]  I think so.
[01:51:36.171 --> 01:51:59.991]  Being an actor movie for a rated-r movie and they can go around and be in a g-rated movie I can go and entertain and adults in a club, but also entertain a group of students and young children I'm able to do that because I'm an adult and I know how to filter myself And I just think that it is implorable some of the opinions that I've seen and some of the looks I received here tonight The eyes that people give you whenever they think that you are the one
[01:52:06.614 --> 01:52:13.118]  What's disgusting is grown adults wanting to go ruin the innocence of children and try to confuse them and that's what this is.
[01:52:13.138 --> 01:52:15.639]  He goes into the grooming in a moment and it's obscene.
[01:52:15.719 --> 01:52:20.302]  I mean imagine if you went to a topless bar and you saw three-year-olds putting money in the g-string of women.
[01:52:20.522 --> 01:52:22.523]  You'd say it was sick and evil and illegal.
[01:52:23.123 --> 01:52:27.245]  But this goes on at these schools and events where these guys shake their asses in the kids' face.
[01:52:27.585 --> 01:52:31.187]  Most of them are, quote, adult entertainers, as this guy's saying.
[01:52:31.868 --> 01:52:33.689]  And we videotaped this ourselves.
[01:52:33.729 --> 01:52:34.849]  This is happening everywhere.
[01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:42.573]  I can't show some of this because the men have glitter on their genitals around the kids, and the kids are hugging them when these guys have got, like, foot long.
[01:52:42.653 --> 01:52:44.294]  I mean, folks, I can't believe it.
[01:52:44.534 --> 01:52:46.996]  But this is showing how insane this is.
[01:52:47.116 --> 01:52:48.837]  I cannot show our TV viewers.
[01:52:49.537 --> 01:52:51.620]  What children are being shown here because of the FCC.
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:52.421]  We're on a lot of TV stations.
[01:52:52.762 --> 01:52:54.984]  And I'm gonna go to Faith, but let's finish him talking about grooming.
[01:52:55.245 --> 01:52:55.585]  Here it is.
[01:53:09.923 --> 01:53:11.844]  You see, it's about throwing it at your face, man.
[01:53:11.864 --> 01:53:15.685]  People in demon clown outfits shaking their ass in front of your five-year-old and they don't even tell you
[01:53:31.053 --> 01:53:32.876]  Either this is the park or you go to jail.
[01:53:32.936 --> 01:53:36.261]  But again, it's about, oh, you hear them hissing when I say I'm going to groom your kids?
[01:53:36.521 --> 01:53:37.242]  Damn it, I'm doing it!
[01:53:37.262 --> 01:53:37.743]  And that's it.
[01:53:37.963 --> 01:53:39.766]  Faith Goldie, this is your expertise.
[01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:41.809]  You got in the media to expose this.
[01:53:41.869 --> 01:53:42.610]  Tell us what's going on.
[01:53:43.604 --> 01:53:44.224]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:44.265 --> 01:53:53.831]  I got into media because of the fact that in my province of Ontario, they're pushing forward a sex ed curriculum from junior kindergarten all the way up to grade 8.
[01:53:55.072 --> 01:54:00.195]  And it was actually, its chief architect is a convicted child pornographer.
[01:54:00.235 --> 01:54:02.137]  So we see this time and time again.
[01:54:02.637 --> 01:54:05.739]  No one grows up being this sort of sexual deviant.
[01:54:06.059 --> 01:54:11.103]  I'm sorry to say, they've been groomed because of some sort of exposure, desensitization or abuse.
[01:54:11.583 --> 01:54:20.649]  And so what happens is basically the way that these sexual deviants procreate more sexual deviation is by abusing others.
[01:54:20.749 --> 01:54:23.992]  And regrettably what we have are two different types of victims.
[01:54:24.372 --> 01:54:27.814]  Of course, kids cannot consent to any sort of sexual activity.
[01:54:28.155 --> 01:54:32.257]  So they find themselves in those sorts of situations because of one of two reasons.
[01:54:32.317 --> 01:54:34.379]  Number one, without their parents,
[01:54:34.939 --> 01:54:37.480]  Knowing or number two, with their parents knowing.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:45.624]  And more and more, what I find most troubling, is that parents are actually bringing these kids into these drag read-ins.
[01:54:45.924 --> 01:54:54.168]  You know, consenting to their kids getting this sort of sexual education where, say in my province, six-year-olds are being taught about consents.
[01:54:54.869 --> 01:54:58.450]  Eight-year-olds are being taught about the whole gender queer spectrum.
[01:54:58.771 --> 01:55:01.412]  Grade five kids, they're being taught about, you know,
[01:55:02.509 --> 01:55:02.789]  I think?
[01:55:24.006 --> 01:55:29.276]  Or every tyrannical, you know, government leader is themselves a pedophile or a diddler or what have you.
[01:55:29.596 --> 01:55:33.363]  We know why they like this sort of thing and why they help push it.
[01:55:33.423 --> 01:55:36.609]  It's because it leads to the moral decay of the...
[01:55:37.486 --> 01:55:37.646]  I think?
[01:55:58.132 --> 01:55:59.893]  Old morality doesn't start on the streets.
[01:55:59.953 --> 01:56:01.314]  It starts inside your soul.
[01:56:01.374 --> 01:56:04.116]  And so that's why they're getting these kids when they're weak.
[01:56:04.136 --> 01:56:09.299]  They're getting them when they're vulnerable, which is when they are specifically what they are, which is children.
[01:56:09.339 --> 01:56:15.222]  And so what I'd say is that any parent, if you see this happening, number one, get your kid the hell out of harm's way.
[01:56:15.542 --> 01:56:20.525]  And number two, become proactive because a lot of other parents are asleep at the wheel.
[01:56:20.585 --> 01:56:26.729]  And what I've seen with my friends with young children is that it's become almost impossible to shelter their kids
[01:56:27.029 --> 01:56:32.090]  From other kids whose parents are putting them in these sorts of situations, who are raising them gender neutral.
[01:56:32.110 --> 01:56:33.130]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:56:33.170 --> 01:56:34.170]  This is epidemic.
[01:56:34.630 --> 01:56:36.151]  This is happening in the Bible Belt.
[01:56:37.151 --> 01:56:52.293]  The UK is the model, the Tavistock Institute for Depopulation, and they know that if you'll let Caitlyn Jenner on the cover of a magazine as the most beautiful woman in the world, when it's not Caitlyn Jenner, it's an ugly dude, it's a war on reality they know you'll put up with anything, and really it's a form of spiritual vampirism.
[01:56:53.134 --> 01:56:55.054]  This whole worldwide system is run on
[01:56:56.214 --> 01:57:06.199]  Hurting children, destroying their innocence, and all the studies show sexualization of children absolutely screws them up for life, and many of them then become abusers themselves.
[01:57:06.459 --> 01:57:22.606]  So they're building armies of future pedophiles, who then are obsessed with relationships with children, because as a child someone molested them, so now they are hungry to get to your kid, to the point they'll form coalitions, and then come literally forcing themselves in.
[01:57:22.626 --> 01:57:23.867]  I mean, take Anderson Cooper.
[01:57:24.949 --> 01:57:29.333]  He is the, you know, top globalist worth probably over 500 billion dollars.
[01:57:29.573 --> 01:57:30.494]  They say he has no money.
[01:57:30.514 --> 01:57:34.437]  Well, what does the family money of the Robert Barron estates?
[01:57:34.477 --> 01:57:36.179]  He's related to six Robert Barron groups.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:38.781]  He is all tax-free.
[01:57:39.241 --> 01:57:43.405]  But he was inducted as a child model by Calvin Klein and others at age nine.
[01:57:43.745 --> 01:57:47.629]  And then, of course, I'm not going to get into it all, but it's well known, okay?
[01:57:47.929 --> 01:57:49.310]  It's well known who Anderson Cooper is.
[01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:50.311]  It must have been done to him.
[01:57:50.331 --> 01:57:50.911]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.931 --> 01:57:51.272]  Stay with us.
[01:57:55.257 --> 01:57:57.239]  We've had the biggest sales in our history.
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:03.223]  Because it's end of year, we want to get all the stock out, so let's pay inventory on it.
[01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:08.947]  George Soros has been trying to shut us down, trying to take our banking away, where we can't even process credit cards.
[01:58:08.967 --> 01:58:11.609]  You saw PayPal and others go, but we've got others.
[01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:20.015]  But I'm not going to sit there with a full warehouse of t-shirts, water filters, air filters, high quality non-GMO heirloom seeds, really high quality supplements.
[01:58:20.175 --> 01:58:22.317]  We're moving to sell everything
[01:58:22.597 --> 01:58:23.418]  By the end of the year.
[01:58:23.678 --> 01:58:24.859]  And clear out our warehouse.
[01:58:25.080 --> 01:58:27.202]  And to do that, we're giving the biggest specials ever.
[01:58:27.422 --> 01:58:27.922]  On everything.
[01:58:28.123 --> 01:58:29.184]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:58:29.724 --> 01:58:31.005]  50% off on the high quality supplements.
[01:58:31.266 --> 01:58:39.334]  That's X2, X3, Brain Force, Ultimate Bone Broth, Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality, Colloidal Silver, Super Blue Fluoride Free.
[01:58:39.694 --> 01:58:42.756]  Iodine and Colloidal Silver Fortified Toothpaste and Mouthwash.
[01:58:42.896 --> 01:58:46.858]  Happy's Mood and Body Knockout Ultimate Sleep Formula.
[01:58:47.078 --> 01:58:48.379]  Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:58:48.479 --> 01:58:50.480]  Bodies with 95% Humidoids.
[01:58:50.620 --> 01:58:51.521]  DNA Force.
[01:58:51.561 --> 01:58:53.762]  What an incredible deal on that flagship product.
[01:58:53.842 --> 01:58:54.582]  Pollen Block.
[01:58:54.662 --> 01:58:55.683]  Bio-True Selenium.
[01:58:55.723 --> 01:58:56.804]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:58:56.824 --> 01:58:58.124]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:58:58.144 --> 01:58:59.665]  We're going to have to end one of these specials.
[01:58:59.785 --> 01:59:04.368]  I may be able to extend this Cyber Monday special to Wednesday or Thursday, but one of the sales that's got to end
[01:59:04.608 --> 01:59:07.250]  Is the Alexa Pure Pro Stainless Steel Gravity Fed Filter for $127.
[01:59:07.390 --> 01:59:11.414]  That is because the folks that make it want to get rid of it all before the end of the year.
[01:59:11.514 --> 01:59:12.935]  And they only had a couple thousand.
[01:59:13.015 --> 01:59:15.137]  It's down to less than $500 right now.
[01:59:15.257 --> 01:59:16.718]  So that's going to end in the next few days.
[01:59:16.838 --> 01:59:19.040]  Alexa Pure Pro Water Filtration System.
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.201]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, $127.
[01:59:20.521 --> 01:59:22.282]  Many competitors aren't as good or $350.
[01:59:22.402 --> 01:59:25.245]  It's a great deal at $249 usually.
[01:59:25.425 --> 01:59:26.526]  Now it's at $127.
[01:59:27.066 --> 01:59:30.549]  So for yourself, your family, as a gift, it's a great time to do it.
[01:59:30.629 --> 01:59:31.790]  A lot of these are lost leaders.
[01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:34.251]  Take advantage of it and fund the InfoWars today.
[01:59:34.471 --> 01:59:35.231]  It's all there.
[01:59:35.251 --> 01:59:36.752]  50% off their minimum.
[01:59:36.812 --> 01:59:39.534]  Some of it is 75% off.
[01:59:39.814 --> 01:59:41.595]  Double Patriot points on top of free shipping.
[01:59:41.675 --> 01:59:43.315]  Instead of 5 points, what's your next purchase?
[01:59:43.336 --> 01:59:43.836]  10 points.
[01:59:44.096 --> 01:59:47.258]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:54.423 --> 01:59:58.535]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.037 --> 02:00:00.361]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:24.492]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:26.092 --> 02:00:30.834]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.755 --> 02:00:39.718]  There's nothing more powerful than a man and woman who teamed up together in that union, and then building the world, the universe together.
[02:00:40.379 --> 02:00:43.260]  And it's holy, and God has said that, but we also know that.
[02:00:44.346 --> 02:00:47.268]  And the elites, the globalists, the satanists, they want to rip that apart.
[02:00:47.408 --> 02:00:49.589]  And Faith Goldie is in Fuego.
[02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:54.531]  She's about to get married to her groom, a great patriot.
[02:00:54.551 --> 02:00:59.174]  They're over there in Europe, where he's from, in Czechoslovakia and Prague.
[02:00:59.574 --> 02:01:05.979]  And we're talking about these poor children who deserve to be innocent and to have a future and learn about the universe and learn about history.
[02:01:06.059 --> 02:01:11.983]  Instead, they're having people obsessed with sexualizing them come into their lives.
[02:01:12.023 --> 02:01:15.666]  And we're going to do one more segment with her and then at 15 after I'll do the big huge news, folks.
[02:01:16.046 --> 02:01:17.947]  To call everybody you know, this is very important.
[02:01:17.967 --> 02:01:18.928]  You're going to hear it here first.
[02:01:19.428 --> 02:01:20.189]  It's all coming up.
[02:01:20.549 --> 02:01:23.032]  Don't forget, David Knight Show, 8am to 11am every day.
[02:01:23.052 --> 02:01:26.095]  The Alex Jones Show, 11am to 3pm every day.
[02:01:26.496 --> 02:01:29.699]  And then, of course, the War Room, 3 to 6pm, with Roger Stone and Owen Schroer doing a great job.
[02:01:29.719 --> 02:01:32.803]  We're going to add more broadcasts by the New Year or so.
[02:01:32.823 --> 02:01:33.624]  We're a little bit behind.
[02:01:33.644 --> 02:01:35.105]  You can see why we're under attack.
[02:01:35.125 --> 02:01:35.686]  But that's okay.
[02:01:35.706 --> 02:01:36.447]  We expected this.
[02:01:36.827 --> 02:01:37.848]  And thanks for all your support.
[02:01:37.888 --> 02:01:40.431]  But I've always been a libertarian guy.
[02:01:41.372 --> 02:01:52.541]  And so, I'm a Christian, but I wasn't brought up to throw stones in glass houses, and I know there are conservative, you know, people who are homosexual, heterosexual, there's all sorts of stuff that's going on.
[02:01:53.513 --> 02:02:13.696]  The point is, is that there is a LGBTP movement now, with the P for Pedophilia, in Salon, and in the New York Times, everywhere, and Vice, promoting sex with kids, and that's what NAMBLA wants, so they're blurring all the lines, and they're coming into the schools, and it's so outrageous that, oh, you don't want to say anything in the name of tolerance that you're letting men dressed as women
[02:02:14.557 --> 02:02:16.099]  I've seen the story times around the country.
[02:02:16.119 --> 02:02:18.842]  This is on national news going, shake your booty kids.
[02:02:19.102 --> 02:02:20.724]  You can be a boy or a girl.
[02:02:21.285 --> 02:02:23.367]  Sometimes boys are with boys and girls with girls.
[02:02:23.848 --> 02:02:25.850]  Kids aren't even thinking about stuff.
[02:02:25.870 --> 02:02:29.954]  Imagine if a kindergarten teacher said, sometimes men are with women.
[02:02:30.015 --> 02:02:30.976]  Sometimes they have sex.
[02:02:30.996 --> 02:02:32.237]  You'd be like, kids aren't into that.
[02:02:32.297 --> 02:02:32.878]  What are you doing?
[02:02:32.898 --> 02:02:33.438]  You're a pervert.
[02:02:34.119 --> 02:02:36.440]  But if it's LBGTP, it's okay.
[02:02:36.460 --> 02:02:38.781]  So Faith, this is a short segment, longer segment coming up.
[02:02:38.801 --> 02:02:44.504]  We're going to play some shocking clips of not also the trans movement is now saying whites are inherently evil.
[02:02:45.224 --> 02:02:55.109]  So they're bringing in all these minority populations, weaponizing them, making us pay for the sex changes, and it's all basically led by a bunch of weird white liberals.
[02:02:55.209 --> 02:02:56.350]  What in the world's going on here?
[02:02:57.884 --> 02:02:59.246]  You absolutely have nailed it.
[02:02:59.266 --> 02:03:09.017]  I'll tell you one thing I noticed when I was running for Mayor of Toronto was that going door to door, the people that I most dreaded to see were downtown white liberals.
[02:03:09.378 --> 02:03:10.859]  They were the most vitriolic.
[02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:17.147]  They were the ones who were frankly, pardon my French, the most screwed up in the head, completely brainwashed
[02:03:17.287 --> 02:03:35.892]  Too many pints of Kool-Aid, and we're telling me about how great our Islamofascist, LGBTP future was going to be, where the white man would cease to exist, and, you know, we'd be demographically replaced by some sort of, like I said, you know, super pedophile in a niqab.
[02:03:35.912 --> 02:03:40.113]  A man who doesn't work, with a huge beard that has sex slaves, that wears a giant nightgown.
[02:03:41.229 --> 02:03:46.254]  Yeah, who apparently still likes pedophilia and transgenderism.
[02:03:46.594 --> 02:03:54.581]  There has been a complete head job that has been done, frankly, on the Western European white male and really the woman as well.
[02:03:54.621 --> 02:04:05.952]  I have to say, it's the white woman that I actually dreaded the most because I think the mixture of the white ethno-masochism, which is this sort of self-hatred that we've been taught through this
[02:04:06.312 --> 02:04:09.194]  Constant chorus of, you're a racist, you're a colonialist.
[02:04:09.234 --> 02:04:14.598]  These are all the sorts of ways that racism is structural and systemic within our culture.
[02:04:14.978 --> 02:04:30.949]  That, coupled with a very, very strong pill of feminism, this fourth wave cancerous feminism that we have, has made this robo-white female that has absolutely no grounding in reality.
[02:04:31.049 --> 02:04:32.230]  She doesn't want children.
[02:04:32.571 --> 02:04:34.633]  She wants a migrant invasion.
[02:04:34.713 --> 02:04:38.637]  She doesn't want God or law and order.
[02:04:39.418 --> 02:04:44.664]  She wants Islam and the cabs for her neighbors and slum marches for herself.
[02:04:45.545 --> 02:04:47.728]  It's all totally cuckoo banana cakes.
[02:04:47.768 --> 02:04:50.591]  And I think part of this rise in everything from
[02:04:50.931 --> 02:04:54.396]  You know, birth control feminism and this liberal white guilt.
[02:04:55.578 --> 02:05:03.108]  The lack of motherhood is really closely connected with why... Oh, the mainline feminist groups brag, I love killing my baby.
[02:05:03.973 --> 02:05:13.938]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.
[02:05:14.158 --> 02:05:24.043]  Now, I've got my Knockout right here and we're going to take it and we're going to look at the actual results of the Knockout Sleep Formula in real time.
[02:05:24.103 --> 02:05:26.905]  So let me take my Knockout first.
[02:05:28.446 --> 02:05:32.948]  But while we're waiting to see the effects of the Knockout,
[02:05:36.822 --> 02:05:44.824]  I've got some very, very, very important news that I want to get to.
[02:05:45.964 --> 02:05:53.025]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[02:05:53.425 --> 02:05:56.626]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[02:05:56.886 --> 02:06:00.767]  Head on over to InfoWarsLife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[02:06:00.987 --> 02:06:02.367]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:19.422]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.685 --> 02:06:33.705]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[02:06:33.885 --> 02:06:34.445]  to 3 p.m.
[02:06:34.465 --> 02:06:34.805]  Central.
[02:06:34.845 --> 02:06:35.346]  I'm here live.
[02:06:36.506 --> 02:06:37.886]  Roger Stone's with us for the fourth hour.
[02:06:38.106 --> 02:06:39.587]  Couldn't be more of an exclusive guest.
[02:06:40.307 --> 02:06:45.668]  With all the insanity going on as the whole Mueller situation comes to a fetid, scrofulous head.
[02:06:46.628 --> 02:06:48.068]  And I said I'd do it this segment.
[02:06:48.348 --> 02:06:50.589]  I gotta keep Faith Golding on because she's so on fire.
[02:06:51.489 --> 02:06:52.849]  I'm gonna get to the big enchilada.
[02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:54.970]  Hal Trump's gonna strike back at the deep swamp.
[02:06:54.990 --> 02:06:55.950]  This is an exclusive.
[02:06:57.190 --> 02:06:58.111]  This is an exclusive.
[02:06:59.771 --> 02:06:59.911]  Now,
[02:07:02.236 --> 02:07:08.860]  Faith Goldie was just getting into the abuse of children, the targeting of children, the giant Islamic rape gangs in Europe and Canada.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:09.461]  They're protected.
[02:07:09.781 --> 02:07:10.742]  They're being set up here.
[02:07:10.822 --> 02:07:11.722]  Why the left works with them.
[02:07:11.742 --> 02:07:18.527]  I want to give her the floor for the balance of this segment, but since we mentioned it, let's play this clip, it's the end of it again, of Lafayette, Louisiana.
[02:07:19.267 --> 02:07:30.855]  Yesterday, City Council, where they want to have drag queens that also work as adult performers, come in and talk to your children about LGBT and how they might want to change their sex.
[02:07:30.955 --> 02:07:36.599]  I mean, this could not be more abusive, more out of control, more of a pervert activity.
[02:07:36.619 --> 02:07:40.461]  Imagine if a random guy said, I want to come talk to your daughters about heterosexuality.
[02:07:40.481 --> 02:07:42.363]  We'd say, I'm going to beat your ass.
[02:07:42.443 --> 02:07:46.025]  But, oh, that's LGBT, and it's a guy dressed in a goblin outfit.
[02:07:46.465 --> 02:07:48.887]  They'll call it, by the way, drag queen.
[02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:53.052]  This isn't Bob Hope joking around on Halloween playing golf in a dress.
[02:07:53.413 --> 02:07:53.934]  That's funny.
[02:07:54.655 --> 02:07:58.500]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is dudes shaking their ass in your child's face.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:00.783]  So let's play that clip and then one more from England.
[02:08:00.823 --> 02:08:01.063]  Here it is.
[02:08:01.718 --> 02:08:10.684]  I just want to let you know that this event is something that's going to be very beautiful, and for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[02:08:10.984 --> 02:08:15.607]  We are trying to groom the next generation to not see the way that they just did.
[02:08:16.087 --> 02:08:19.309]  And just because I said that, you heard the little plore of people behind me.
[02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:25.032]  Yeah, this is an adult man that works as an adult performer, dresses as a woman, who wants to talk to your five-year-old.
[02:08:25.333 --> 02:08:27.394]  Now here's the clip I want to get Faith to talk about.
[02:08:28.041 --> 02:08:30.604]  This is up on newswars.com and presentplanet.com.
[02:08:30.964 --> 02:08:31.865]  Get this out to everybody, folks.
[02:08:31.885 --> 02:08:32.586]  Give it to your church.
[02:08:32.646 --> 02:08:33.226]  Make it an issue.
[02:08:33.586 --> 02:08:39.512]  Trans activists claim 76 kids at school are actually transgender and not brainwashed.
[02:08:39.612 --> 02:08:45.698]  And we now know they're targeting mentally retarded children, autistic children, and then saying, oh, you don't have an age of consent now.
[02:08:46.019 --> 02:08:50.223]  You can decide to be chemically castrated at age 6 in England, age 8 in Texas.
[02:08:51.023 --> 02:08:57.528]  And then the very same person last year on the BBC said that whites are inherently evil bad people.
[02:08:57.568 --> 02:09:00.009]  So here is the quote Muslim transgender man.
[02:09:00.029 --> 02:09:00.409]  Here it is.
[02:09:01.190 --> 02:09:06.353]  If we look at how Brighton is as an area, it's got an extremely high LGBT population.
[02:09:06.393 --> 02:09:07.534]  It's extremely liberal.
[02:09:07.934 --> 02:09:15.499]  So when kids are in a school and they feel, oh, there's no stigma attached to being gender fluid or trans.
[02:09:15.840 --> 02:09:19.222]  So if they feel supported in an environment, then they're going to be questioned.
[02:09:19.462 --> 02:09:28.112]  Why should they be encouraged to do this when it's clearly for many of them... Because there's nothing wrong with being questioning about... Nobody's going to persuade me that 76 kids at one school in Brighton woke up one day and decided to be gender fluid.
[02:09:28.132 --> 02:09:29.533]  Well, who said that they woke up one day?
[02:09:29.553 --> 02:09:32.657]  Who says that it's not something that happens overnight?
[02:09:32.797 --> 02:09:33.999]  It's something... But where does this end?
[02:09:34.019 --> 02:09:36.702]  Do we end up with literally nobody in the future?
[02:09:37.382 --> 02:09:39.104]  Identifying as male and female?
[02:09:39.124 --> 02:09:40.346]  Well, maybe, maybe.
[02:09:40.446 --> 02:09:40.686]  Really?
[02:09:40.886 --> 02:09:41.867]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:09:41.968 --> 02:09:43.049]  Why would you be happy with that?
[02:09:43.069 --> 02:09:47.914]  Not nobody, but some, you know, some people are trans and that's, that's the fact.
[02:09:47.974 --> 02:09:52.119]  Do you genuinely think 76 kids in one school are transgender?
[02:09:52.219 --> 02:09:53.920]  I'm saying that it's a possibility.
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:54.681]  Is it possible?
[02:09:54.921 --> 02:10:04.988]  They've all just latched on to a fad that is getting more and more attention and they are basically having their minds turned to gender fluidity.
[02:10:05.308 --> 02:10:09.431]  I think that what we're seeing is... You know, Piers Morgan I know is actually a really smart guy.
[02:10:09.451 --> 02:10:11.493]  He just was a mercenary on CNN.
[02:10:13.362 --> 02:10:19.488]  I'm going to play this next clip of the person that they're actually glorifying that's teaching in the schools, who says white people are inherently evil.
[02:10:19.848 --> 02:10:34.021]  So you're going to let adults come in, children are supposed to be followers, they're designed genetically to do it, and you have their teachers teach them they're another sex, so it becomes a cult, becomes a club, becomes a gang, and then the children, through peer pressure, let the state then sterilize them.
[02:10:34.702 --> 02:10:36.004]  It's unbelievable.
[02:10:36.605 --> 02:10:43.597]  Here is a clip, a flashback, white race, the most violent on earth, trans model on BBC being glorified.
[02:10:46.826 --> 02:10:58.133]  If white people want to see an improvement for people of color, they need to understand that racism is not learned, it's inherited, and either consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege.
[02:10:58.473 --> 02:11:04.897]  The uncomfortable truth is that the white race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth.
[02:11:07.307 --> 02:11:17.374]  My worry is that whatever governments do to tinker with institutional racism, it is so ingrained in the fabric of British society that it is too late to do anything about it.
[02:11:21.741 --> 02:11:23.361]  That's the same person on the show there.
[02:11:23.601 --> 02:11:26.262]  So let's now go back to Faith Goldie, who is a woman.
[02:11:26.782 --> 02:11:30.363]  A feminist got kicked off Twitter, a bunch of them, for saying that women are women, men are men.
[02:11:30.763 --> 02:11:31.663]  Two plus two equals four.
[02:11:32.303 --> 02:11:33.484]  Faith Goldie is a woman.
[02:11:33.624 --> 02:11:34.384]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:11:34.544 --> 02:11:35.084]  I am a man.
[02:11:35.124 --> 02:11:35.884]  You can see the difference.
[02:11:35.964 --> 02:11:36.344]  I'm ugly.
[02:11:36.384 --> 02:11:36.824]  She's pretty.
[02:11:37.644 --> 02:11:38.365]  She can have babies.
[02:11:38.445 --> 02:11:38.805]  I can't.
[02:11:39.265 --> 02:11:41.625]  I can gouge people's eyeballs out pretty easily.
[02:11:41.705 --> 02:11:44.106]  She might not be able to do it as easy, but she's pretty tough.
[02:11:44.126 --> 02:11:45.066]  She's got Greek backgrounds.
[02:11:45.086 --> 02:11:45.726]  Those women are pretty tough.
[02:11:46.066 --> 02:11:48.127]  Seriously, the five minutes we have left, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:11:48.167 --> 02:11:48.727]  FaithGoldie.ca.
[02:11:50.227 --> 02:11:52.949]  Put a bow on this for us, the sports culture, all of it.
[02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.969]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:11:55.010 --> 02:12:01.773]  My favorite is when people say that there is a trait that is inherent to a race while also saying that they are at the same time not racist.
[02:12:01.833 --> 02:12:04.494]  By saying that all white people are racist?
[02:12:04.934 --> 02:12:10.337]  Yeah, sorry, I don't care if you're transgender or what the color of your skin is, that's actually a pretty racist comment.
[02:12:11.177 --> 02:12:24.288]  As for the grooming of these young autistic children, that's what we're seeing across the UK and other jurisdictions, this is just the next evolution of what the Gay-Straight Alliance groups across North America, that they were putting into our school institutions.
[02:12:24.328 --> 02:12:26.050]  This is just Generation 2.
[02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:31.194]  The GSAs were built into our schools to give a safe space to kids.
[02:12:31.474 --> 02:12:36.978]  Where parents and teachers did not have to be informed, but oh, what do you know, there was always a teacher supervising.
[02:12:37.319 --> 02:12:47.987]  They were basically breeding grounds to normalize deviant behavior, and then also not just normalize it, but also to sort of make it a trend, and that's indeed what we're seeing here.
[02:12:48.507 --> 02:12:59.316]  Preying on autistic children, this is what some of the most tyrannical regimes have done in even recent history, and that's to use the slow, the autistic,
[02:12:59.816 --> 02:13:02.357]  To help bolster, frankly, their statistics.
[02:13:02.417 --> 02:13:12.022]  And that's what this LGBT movement is doing, is that they're preying on autistic children to bolster their statistics.
[02:13:12.363 --> 02:13:17.785]  This is beyond sick, this is reprehensible, this is evil, and it should be condemned in every single way.
[02:13:18.165 --> 02:13:22.888]  We were joking around a little, talking a little bit about sports during the break, so I just want to say this.
[02:13:23.488 --> 02:13:26.110]  Men, turn off your TVs on Sundays.
[02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:30.693]  As video games are to young men, sports games are to older men.
[02:13:31.013 --> 02:13:38.918]  It is normal and natural for you to have loyalty, to have patriotism, to want to fight for your country, to want to have your team be victorious.
[02:13:39.279 --> 02:13:41.740]  But it's not on the 50-yard line.
[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:43.702]  It's on your borderlines right now.
[02:13:43.842 --> 02:13:45.023]  That's where we are called.
[02:13:45.343 --> 02:13:46.984]  Your colors are not some city.
[02:13:47.384 --> 02:13:47.724]  That's
[02:14:03.797 --> 02:14:08.840]  Feeding natural appetites in a very unnatural and frankly unproductive way.
[02:14:08.940 --> 02:14:12.162]  So even if you know that they're fighting for your country, go fight for your family.
[02:14:12.462 --> 02:14:14.764]  Turn off your TV on Sundays.
[02:14:14.784 --> 02:14:16.685]  There's a bunch of guys taking a knee anyway.
[02:14:17.025 --> 02:14:22.809]  And go spend some time with Junior or spend some time with, you know, your local community center, whatever it is.
[02:14:23.189 --> 02:14:29.373]  And why don't you go have a rally against this UN migrant compact that we're going to be signing any day now down in Morocco.
[02:14:30.011 --> 02:14:42.383]  That's right, because, again, they take our normal energy to fight for our tribe, our people, our ideals, our system, our property, our everything, and they project it onto some sports team, and they brag it's bread and circus.
[02:14:42.403 --> 02:14:45.906]  Since the times of Rome, this is how they control us, and it's not fulfilling.
[02:14:46.146 --> 02:14:47.267]  The porn's not fulfilling.
[02:14:47.748 --> 02:14:49.429]  The video games aren't fulfilling.
[02:14:50.170 --> 02:14:50.310]  No.
[02:14:50.650 --> 02:14:54.474]  Imagine going to your church and making them talk about the targeting of children, or world government.
[02:14:55.819 --> 02:15:10.588]  Being men and taking the culture back and not letting LA and San Francisco and London and Paris and all the mentally ill, horribly sad people, people like Macron, a known admitted sex slave, when he was a child to the Rothschilds and others, that's confirmed, that's mainstream news.
[02:15:10.948 --> 02:15:12.569]  He was like 12 years old, being passed around.
[02:15:13.009 --> 02:15:14.450]  That's who Anderson Cooper is.
[02:15:14.490 --> 02:15:15.871]  That's who Macron are.
[02:15:16.271 --> 02:15:18.353]  These are literally brainwashed, programmed,
[02:15:19.173 --> 02:15:20.734]  Trauma-based mind control individuals.
[02:15:21.215 --> 02:15:36.085]  And it's very sad how they do this and they put these abused men in charge all over, who then want to tell women that, oh, women are good by not loving their family and not loving their sons, because they fear real men and real women together, which is an unstoppable force, faith-building.
[02:15:37.413 --> 02:15:46.077]  Look, if you look at all the top EU leaders right now, they've got all sorts of degeneracies, but one thing that they don't have are kids, and that's why they don't give a damn about the future of our nation.
[02:15:46.217 --> 02:15:57.643]  Unlike President God-Emperor Donald Trump, it might be from a couple different ladies, but he's got lots of kids, and he sure as heck gives a damn about the future of not just that nation, but also all of the global order.
[02:15:57.663 --> 02:16:00.104]  So God bless him, and God bless America, and God bless you, Alex!
[02:16:00.144 --> 02:16:01.565]  I'm so happy I was back on your show today.
[02:16:01.645 --> 02:16:02.325]  You are awesome!
[02:16:02.904 --> 02:16:13.147]  It was George Orwell who famously wrote in 1984 that telling the truth in a world of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
[02:16:13.527 --> 02:16:25.571]  And as we prepare to close out 2018, isn't it pretty hard to believe that to say there are only two genders, men and women, is a criminal act in places like California?
[02:16:26.571 --> 02:16:31.873]  What if you say that Bruce Jenner was a man in the Olympics, and he's still a man?
[02:16:32.113 --> 02:16:33.254]  Well, that's dead naming.
[02:16:33.554 --> 02:16:41.577]  And to say that it's okay to be white, because all over the news, from the New York Times to CNN, they say white people are inherently evil.
[02:16:41.957 --> 02:16:45.138]  Then they say it's racist to say no, that it's okay to be white.
[02:16:45.498 --> 02:16:47.519]  And it's bad to say that we have a nation.
[02:16:47.659 --> 02:16:48.279]  We're borders.
[02:16:48.699 --> 02:16:51.380]  In fact, being a nationalist, we're told is evil.
[02:16:51.841 --> 02:16:55.402]  This is the global corporate fourth war.
[02:16:56.308 --> 02:16:58.249]  World War III was the Cold War.
[02:16:59.630 --> 02:17:01.331]  I agree with the CIA's analysis of that.
[02:17:01.731 --> 02:17:19.303]  And now in this fourth war, it's a bunch of immoral corporations, the Chi-Coms, the EU and others, with the America-hating Hollywood crowd, literally mobilizing the third world to overrun the United States and destroy what basic freedoms we have left.
[02:17:21.084 --> 02:17:24.427]  The globalists are threatened by first world nations.
[02:17:24.447 --> 02:17:25.728]  They're threatened by the middle class.
[02:17:25.768 --> 02:17:30.071]  They're threatened by the uppity-ness of free market capitalism.
[02:17:30.672 --> 02:17:34.715]  They used free market capitalism to consolidate control and take over the world.
[02:17:35.455 --> 02:17:37.057]  But now they're removing the stairway.
[02:17:37.517 --> 02:17:40.259]  They're removing the ladders for everyone else.
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:42.661]  It's very, very sad to see this.
[02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:46.964]  But the good news is, around the world people are waking up to this.
[02:17:47.485 --> 02:17:50.247]  And nationalists and populists and anti-globalists are being elected.
[02:17:51.749 --> 02:17:57.855]  But the globalists are counter-striking against independent patriot nationalist media like InfoWars.
[02:17:57.895 --> 02:18:03.300]  In fact, we are the chief group under attack because we have been the most effective thanks to your support.
[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:05.141]  You have been the most effective.
[02:18:06.264 --> 02:18:07.805]  At exposing what's really happening.
[02:18:08.405 --> 02:18:12.706]  That's why I just want everybody to count the cost here as we enter the last month of 2018.
[02:18:13.167 --> 02:18:16.668]  And I wanted to thank you for all of your support.
[02:18:17.288 --> 02:18:21.290]  And I wanted just to remind you that employers isn't perfect, but we're fighting as hard as we can.
[02:18:22.512 --> 02:18:23.613]  And without you, we won't be here.
[02:18:24.233 --> 02:18:28.215]  And that's why we're having Cyber Monday turned into Cyber Week.
[02:18:29.436 --> 02:18:31.778]  And it's happening now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:18:32.258 --> 02:18:41.023]  The biggest sales ever as we attempt to sell all the great inventory we have ahead of the year so that we can hopefully be capitalized to fund ourselves at least a few months into next year.
[02:18:41.103 --> 02:18:43.765]  I don't have to tell you, we've been under total siege and harassment.
[02:18:44.205 --> 02:18:44.985]  We're good to go.
[02:19:10.652 --> 02:19:27.321]  At InfoWarsStore.com, there is the revolution of products that are excellent, and the revolution of funding InfoWars that is now in the absolute thick of the battle fighting for the human spirit and human destiny for my children and your children and all of our shared futures together.
[02:19:27.822 --> 02:19:39.068]  And you are provisioning and funding not just the second American Revolution, but a global awakening and a last chance for humanity to really decide whether we want to go into the mark of the beast, human cloning,
[02:19:39.868 --> 02:19:40.969]  Forced sterilization.
[02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:42.629]  Children being sterilized.
[02:19:43.109 --> 02:19:46.070]  This is pure, total, absolute evil.
[02:19:46.170 --> 02:19:49.912]  And Infowars will talk about the forbidden taboo subjects.
[02:19:50.212 --> 02:19:52.533]  We will stand up for human life and human destiny.
[02:19:52.813 --> 02:19:54.273]  And we will fight until the end.
[02:19:54.714 --> 02:19:56.994]  Without your help, we will be defeated by the globalists.
[02:19:57.054 --> 02:19:59.175]  With your help, humanity has a chance.
[02:19:59.575 --> 02:20:00.736]  And thank you all for your support.
[02:20:00.956 --> 02:20:01.376]  God bless you.
[02:20:06.318 --> 02:20:10.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.523 --> 02:20:16.644]  If you leave me, I won't miss you.
[02:20:35.936 --> 02:20:38.757]  And I won't ever take you back.
[02:20:40.258 --> 02:20:46.882]  Girl, your memory won't ever haunt me.
[02:20:48.242 --> 02:20:53.065]  Cause I don't love you, now if you'll buy that.
[02:20:54.466 --> 02:20:58.928]  I got some Porsche front property and I
[02:21:04.195 --> 02:21:24.309]  And if you'll believe there's more than two genders, I'll throw the Golden Gate in free.
[02:21:26.711 --> 02:21:30.474]  The ability to think clearly is to say there's two genders.
[02:21:32.117 --> 02:21:33.679]  1984, it was 2 plus 2, it was 4.
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:39.243]  You know, I'm not building suspense here.
[02:21:41.125 --> 02:21:59.041]  This news is so huge and so important that I'm sitting here with my notes in front of me and thinking back to what my different sources have said and what my own research is and what President Trump did today
[02:22:02.765 --> 02:22:08.608]  And this is the type of speech that somebody would prepare, like, Munch, who was even an orator, an orator, to give.
[02:22:08.748 --> 02:22:16.011]  And I'm not complaining or bitching, I'm just saying, when something is so big, I don't feel worthy.
[02:22:16.552 --> 02:22:17.352]  You know, Wayne's World?
[02:22:17.652 --> 02:22:18.893]  We're not worthy!
[02:22:18.993 --> 02:22:19.953]  We're not worthy!
[02:22:21.594 --> 02:22:25.556]  And I want to say this as perfectly as I can.
[02:22:28.497 --> 02:22:29.558]  And then the segment begins.
[02:22:31.826 --> 02:22:48.750]  And I'm on air, and I've got just news so important, news so dangerous, that I feel like I should be walking around in a field or something, you know what I mean?
[02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:55.511]  Like when something really crazy happens in your life, something even good or something really horrible, kind of like you go outside and you're just like, don't know what to do.
[02:22:57.642 --> 02:23:04.187]  Because that's the quickening that's happening, and it just confirms everything we already know, that we're not in normal situations.
[02:23:05.709 --> 02:23:11.153]  And we're all hyper-awake, and people that aren't awake are in their own world, and it's scary.
[02:23:13.035 --> 02:23:14.456]  And then it comes down to that point.
[02:23:14.996 --> 02:23:21.562]  That's why during the election, the last month or so, I was a big jerk, compared to usual, up here at the office.
[02:23:22.628 --> 02:23:25.810]  Because I just felt the weight of the world on me that we had to do something.
[02:23:25.830 --> 02:23:26.771]  We had to get the word out.
[02:23:26.811 --> 02:23:28.412]  We had to not let them censor us.
[02:23:28.452 --> 02:23:30.933]  We have a responsibility to expose how bad they are.
[02:23:30.993 --> 02:23:42.100]  And, you know, once that was over, it was like a huge weight was lifted off me because that was kind of a tangible focal point of something we needed to do.
[02:23:42.821 --> 02:23:46.023]  And I know that I need to do it because I've got a lot of plans.
[02:23:47.327 --> 02:23:52.049]  And a lot of things I could pull on the Globulus, and I know most of them would be very successful.
[02:23:52.829 --> 02:23:58.292]  But then I've got to permutate what the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth move will be.
[02:23:59.712 --> 02:24:05.255]  It's like playing pool, but you're not just trying to hit one ball into another and knock it over in the corner pocket.
[02:24:05.835 --> 02:24:12.898]  You've got to think move after move after move after move, because these balls just don't go out with limited force.
[02:24:13.258 --> 02:24:14.279]  The breaks aren't like that.
[02:24:15.734 --> 02:24:19.915]  You've got a it's like trying to shoot bulls out a thousand yards with like a 10 power scope.
[02:24:23.436 --> 02:24:26.217]  You're not shooting through the same hole really with your skills.
[02:24:26.297 --> 02:24:32.419]  It's something a little bit different and it's almost a turning loose point where I have the answers.
[02:24:32.599 --> 02:24:43.862]  I know how to beat them, but there's so much data going around that I don't want to just go on air and talk about something like this and then not do it properly.
[02:24:45.708 --> 02:24:56.601]  Because we all know my worst shortcoming is gibbering and jabbering and running on down rabbit trails and not building stuff up.
[02:24:56.621 --> 02:25:03.770]  And then the only time I do build something up is when it's so big I don't even know how to like
[02:25:05.714 --> 02:25:12.739]  You know, one thing I really feel sorry for the cops for, because, you know, there's good cops, there's bad cops, but on average, in the West, the police are good people.
[02:25:12.759 --> 02:25:19.745]  And that's why they're under such attack, because the globals want to get control of them, because they're threatened by the warrior class that they don't fully, you know, dominate.
[02:25:21.706 --> 02:25:25.970]  And they got to go see dead kids, just like paramedics really respect them and firefighters really respect them.
[02:25:26.450 --> 02:25:30.013]  And they got to see kids that are OD'd and people shot up and just constant crap.
[02:25:34.596 --> 02:25:35.317]  And they've also
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:41.143]  Gotta sit there and then second guess what they could have done here, what they could have done there.
[02:25:42.284 --> 02:25:58.377]  And it really just becomes this... This thing of like, you care, so then you feel guilty about everything that's going on, and then you look at other people and they don't even give a damn, and it's just like, this constant thing of like, why do I even care?
[02:25:58.437 --> 02:26:05.343]  But then, there's so many good people that need our help, so we have to fight even harder, even though a lot of these people don't deserve our help.
[02:26:07.185 --> 02:26:08.326]  I think that's what it comes down to.
[02:26:11.587 --> 02:26:23.553]  You know, I know Trump's real from my gut, but it's all verified by his actions and what he's gone through and how angry the system is, and now he tweets out that we're going to go for treason trials.
[02:26:26.174 --> 02:26:27.795]  And that's throwing down the gauntlet, man.
[02:26:28.175 --> 02:26:29.475]  The war's on now.
[02:26:30.496 --> 02:26:32.697]  And I told you that a few weeks ago, and I told you that Sunday.
[02:26:34.284 --> 02:26:35.365]  Because that's what's happening.
[02:26:35.925 --> 02:26:37.225]  I don't need sources to know.
[02:26:37.285 --> 02:26:38.426]  You can feel it.
[02:26:39.186 --> 02:26:39.907]  You can see it.
[02:26:40.487 --> 02:26:41.687]  But then I have the sources.
[02:26:43.608 --> 02:26:44.829]  And see, I am the source.
[02:26:45.449 --> 02:26:46.630]  Just like you are a source.
[02:26:46.690 --> 02:26:53.433]  But in the whole panopticonic pantheon of sources, InfoWars is dreaded and hated and banned.
[02:26:53.733 --> 02:26:57.094]  And I say this not to brag, I don't like the responsibility.
[02:26:58.475 --> 02:27:02.817]  In the councils of government, in Congress, in foreign governments,
[02:27:04.938 --> 02:27:06.739]  I'm seen as like an oracle.
[02:27:08.341 --> 02:27:11.783]  And it means it's believed that I basically don't lie.
[02:27:13.785 --> 02:27:28.056]  And I have a track record of knowing things other people don't know and being able to feed all the data in into a system and then come up with a gestalt of the roadmap and the topography that we're coming in on is with the ground scanning radar.
[02:27:30.165 --> 02:27:33.989]  And if you don't have that ground-scanning spiritual radar, you're gonna crash into those cliffs.
[02:27:34.509 --> 02:27:35.991]  So we're flying at about 100 feet here.
[02:27:39.374 --> 02:27:40.415]  The devil close behind us.
[02:27:42.557 --> 02:27:45.520]  See, the devil's always behind God, always behind God's people.
[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:47.642]  The devil doesn't build, he destroys.
[02:27:47.902 --> 02:27:48.763]  We're making God's image.
[02:27:48.783 --> 02:27:50.184]  We're constructors.
[02:27:50.925 --> 02:27:51.245]  Builders.
[02:27:52.691 --> 02:27:56.494]  And they say, oh, the Illuminati calls their head the great architect.
[02:27:56.554 --> 02:27:57.555]  God's the great architect.
[02:27:57.895 --> 02:27:59.136]  Shall we call God the great architect?
[02:27:59.176 --> 02:28:00.497]  Oh, you're giving us Illuminati terminology.
[02:28:00.557 --> 02:28:01.578]  No, the devil stole that.
[02:28:02.018 --> 02:28:15.368]  The devil's the counterfeit and gets you convinced when you see the real architect in front of you or one of God's projections of architecture in a smaller form.
[02:28:15.388 --> 02:28:17.590]  That's what man is when we're in line with God.
[02:28:20.973 --> 02:28:25.614]  And then you throw away the whole universe because the devil named it and you believe that's the devil.
[02:28:26.234 --> 02:28:29.475]  Like, people think the rising sun behind the planet is a satanic symbol.
[02:28:30.235 --> 02:28:31.816]  That's a symbol of a new day and hope.
[02:28:33.036 --> 02:28:33.916]  Everything is God's.
[02:28:34.456 --> 02:28:35.776]  The devil just puts his name on it.
[02:28:36.697 --> 02:28:36.877]  Alright.
[02:28:38.337 --> 02:28:41.398]  I'm not going to procrastinate because this is bigger than going after Hillary.
[02:28:41.498 --> 02:28:43.598]  This means we're going after the whole deal.
[02:28:43.658 --> 02:28:43.998]  It's on.
[02:28:44.879 --> 02:28:46.699]  And we need to know how they're going to counter-strike as well.
[02:28:48.570 --> 02:28:53.035]  So should I just lay out what's going to happen, or should I give you all the proof and explain how it works?
[02:28:53.656 --> 02:28:55.237]  And see, that's always the dichotomy.
[02:28:55.277 --> 02:28:56.078]  That's the conflict.
[02:28:56.098 --> 02:29:00.523]  I think I'm going to tell you what's going to happen, and then I'm going to tell you how it's going to happen and why.
[02:29:02.145 --> 02:29:02.565]  Attention!
[02:29:03.026 --> 02:29:10.073]  We have been in a continual state of war since we bought into the idea of a permanent standing army after World War II.
[02:29:11.092 --> 02:29:17.259]  We have a Saudi-led attack on Yemen on the port, escalating in just a 24-hour span.
[02:29:17.499 --> 02:29:21.003]  At least 150 people killed after weeks of deadly fighting.
[02:29:21.363 --> 02:29:23.446]  Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen.
[02:29:23.786 --> 02:29:24.607]  Any reporting on that?
[02:29:24.947 --> 02:29:25.168]  No.
[02:29:25.748 --> 02:29:27.210]  They don't care about the lives of people.
[02:29:27.230 --> 02:29:29.212]  They don't care about the lives of these Yemenis.
[02:29:29.252 --> 02:29:32.416]  They don't care about the lives of their own soldiers.
[02:29:33.647 --> 02:29:37.709]  And they don't care about the principles that these soldiers thought they were fighting for either.
[02:29:38.410 --> 02:29:46.094]  The principles, just like the lives of the soldiers, are expendable in these manufactured wars for empire.
[02:29:46.114 --> 02:29:48.936]  And we've got something that is much more dangerous that is coming up right now.
[02:29:49.796 --> 02:29:55.740]  We're coming up to a cycle in human history, a generational turning point.
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:59.262]  And again, you should read the book, Fourth Turning, if you haven't.
[02:30:00.417 --> 02:30:10.339]  Strauss and Howe went back 500 years in American and English-British history to see this recurring cycle about every 80 years, having a major restructuring of society.
[02:30:11.480 --> 02:30:14.680]  Frequently, these restructurings are accompanied by wars.
[02:30:15.601 --> 02:30:18.501]  Things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II.
[02:30:18.521 --> 02:30:21.262]  Those were all fourth-term.
[02:30:21.322 --> 02:30:27.223]  Now, as we talk about resurging old demons, that's what I see coming.
[02:30:27.563 --> 02:30:29.424]  I see history being recycled.
[02:30:30.996 --> 02:30:53.292]  And when you have these standing armies, when you have these politicians who have an empire mindset like Macron, who are trying to accrue and concentrate power to themselves, those are the elements that create things like World War I. Because it was the type of thing that the founders had always looked at Europe as having.
[02:30:53.512 --> 02:30:56.715]  These constant, eternal European wars.
[02:30:56.935 --> 02:30:58.156]  Not a remaking of society.
[02:30:59.329 --> 02:31:01.451]  Because, you know, people look at that and they say, that was a just war.
[02:31:01.951 --> 02:31:03.353]  That was a justifiable war.
[02:31:03.453 --> 02:31:03.633]  Whatever.
[02:31:03.653 --> 02:31:10.139]  They look at the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, they look at World War II and they say, yeah, that was a time when we were really fighting for something.
[02:31:10.199 --> 02:31:11.580]  World War I, they weren't fighting for anything.
[02:31:12.821 --> 02:31:15.243]  Patriotism was summed up by Smedley Butler.
[02:31:15.523 --> 02:31:19.087]  He said, talking about true patriotism, he said, we fight to protect our home.
[02:31:20.628 --> 02:31:21.629]  And our Constitution.
[02:31:23.095 --> 02:31:24.956]  So we fight to defend our lives.
[02:31:25.016 --> 02:31:27.838]  To defend our lives.
[02:31:27.918 --> 02:31:30.359]  Not in foreign wars of empire.
[02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:33.281]  Not for regime change in the Middle East.
[02:31:33.801 --> 02:31:35.402]  We fight to defend our homes.
[02:31:35.422 --> 02:31:37.223]  He said everything else is a racket.
[02:31:37.683 --> 02:31:39.304]  It is organized crime.
[02:31:39.384 --> 02:31:40.365]  And he was exactly right.
[02:31:41.653 --> 02:31:43.114]  We fight to defend our Constitution.
[02:31:43.174 --> 02:31:44.535]  We're fighting to defend our values.
[02:31:45.415 --> 02:31:46.616]  That is what nationalism is about.
[02:31:46.736 --> 02:31:49.818]  Patriotism is about fighting to defend your homeland.
[02:31:50.658 --> 02:32:00.824]  Nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system and the values embodied in that political and legal system in our Constitution.
[02:32:00.844 --> 02:32:03.986]  And if we had stuck to those values, we would have never been drawn into World War I.
[02:32:05.498 --> 02:32:11.819]  Maybe Emmanuel Macron should read the writing of our former president, James Madison, father of the Bill of Rights.
[02:32:12.579 --> 02:32:19.981]  He said, throughout Europe, the armies kept under the pretext of defending have enslaved the people.
[02:32:21.381 --> 02:32:27.183]  And quite frankly, that is the true purpose of Macron's EU army.
[02:32:28.483 --> 02:32:31.703]  He's not going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions.
[02:32:31.744 --> 02:32:33.584]  He's inviting the foreign invaders.
[02:32:34.564 --> 02:32:38.567]  The fifth column coming into the country.
[02:32:38.607 --> 02:32:39.567]  He's opened up the borders.
[02:32:39.607 --> 02:32:43.790]  He's part of the globalist open border cartel.
[02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:46.691]  He is not going to defend people.
[02:32:46.711 --> 02:32:51.354]  He's going to use the army to attack the people who object to that.
[02:32:51.514 --> 02:32:54.596]  Who object to having their homes destroyed.
[02:32:54.716 --> 02:33:01.500]  Armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.
[02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:11.986]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.117 --> 02:33:29.842]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:34:21.014 --> 02:34:34.102]  President Trump has signaled publicly that he wants criminal investigations for indictments and trials for treason to try to overthrow the elected president of the United States.
[02:34:35.543 --> 02:34:39.225]  Try to overthrow the election process of 2016.
[02:34:40.125 --> 02:34:47.788]  Illegal spying on then-candidate Trump, then-nominee Trump, then-president-elect Trump, and then-president Trump.
[02:34:48.829 --> 02:34:49.649]  Lying to Congress.
[02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:55.191]  And then all the other crimes of the Democrats.
[02:34:56.532 --> 02:34:57.092]  Selling U.S.
[02:34:57.112 --> 02:34:59.413]  infrastructure off to China, the EU, and others.
[02:35:01.094 --> 02:35:03.235]  Conspiring to open our borders to foreign invasion.
[02:35:04.909 --> 02:35:10.194]  The President doesn't just have the right, he doesn't just have the jurisdiction, he has the duty to do so.
[02:35:10.334 --> 02:35:28.210]  But, with the announcements today, that he is pushing for criminal investigation, and he has the NSA evidence, and the secret documents, which they admit they have, Congressman Nunes and others have seen them, showing the illegal spying, the lying to Congress, Mueller,
[02:35:29.181 --> 02:35:37.667]  Comey, Hillary, Obama giving the order as president, the DNC involved, W. Washington Schultz, it's open and shut.
[02:35:39.869 --> 02:35:40.689]  But what does that mean?
[02:35:44.492 --> 02:35:54.979]  That means that in the next week, the next two weeks, the next month, this is the prime zone for the globalists to try to stage terror attacks, false flags, trying to kill the president.
[02:35:56.220 --> 02:35:58.402]  This is when everyone has to be on maximum alert.
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:06.225]  In fact, I no longer even feel any anxiety anymore because the roar, which is the silence of battle, is now here politically.
[02:36:06.745 --> 02:36:07.025]  It's here.
[02:36:08.186 --> 02:36:09.347]  And Trump's making his move.
[02:36:10.007 --> 02:36:11.468]  You know, I put the headline out Sunday.
[02:36:12.729 --> 02:36:18.172]  To memorialize it, exclusive Trump set to indict Hillary Clinton and other deep staters in coming months.
[02:36:19.933 --> 02:36:23.556]  I told you a year and a half ago he'd ordered the Justice Department to do these investigations.
[02:36:23.596 --> 02:36:24.617]  They were scared.
[02:36:25.777 --> 02:36:26.558]  And I know why they're scared.
[02:36:26.578 --> 02:36:27.378]  They came from the swamp.
[02:36:27.418 --> 02:36:27.999]  They were yes-men.
[02:36:29.158 --> 02:36:29.958]  They hedged their bets.
[02:36:31.599 --> 02:36:35.360]  But the swamp's fighting back so hard because they know this is different with Trump.
[02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:41.642]  He's committed to this mission all the way.
[02:36:41.722 --> 02:36:54.546]  So let me give you what's coming next from congressional sources, campaign sources, the 2020 campaign, White House sources,
[02:36:56.460 --> 02:37:07.087]  And most importantly, I know how to look at the counter propaganda, the gow lighting, which means preparing the ground.
[02:37:08.988 --> 02:37:19.095]  I know how to look at the propaganda suddenly exploding all over every channel, right on time, that is meant to blunt what's about to come out.
[02:37:21.499 --> 02:37:28.624]  Now, I could see this a few months ago and a few weeks ago, but I wasn't sure until last weekend.
[02:37:30.626 --> 02:37:47.899]  Then, I got a collection of phone calls and texts from three different people yesterday, and then a whole nother person, who's been a great Pentagon source, just as I went on air, reminding me that I was going to go on air and talk about this.
[02:37:49.141 --> 02:37:56.744]  But when I got that fourth person telling me the same thing, and I could see the tea leaves, I knew it was meant to be.
[02:37:58.244 --> 02:38:04.187]  So let me tell you what's about to happen, let me tell you what their cover story is going to be, and then talk about the full ramifications of this.
[02:38:04.927 --> 02:38:07.228]  Because everything has to be done in its time.
[02:38:07.448 --> 02:38:15.031]  I don't want to say things here on air, because the globalists hang on our every word, it's true, before they already know.
[02:38:16.451 --> 02:38:17.752]  And they've known this for a couple weeks.
[02:38:19.758 --> 02:38:20.959]  And I've known it for a while.
[02:38:21.359 --> 02:38:24.101]  That's why I told you, get ready.
[02:38:25.662 --> 02:38:29.345]  Just like I told you Trump was pushing for indictments a year and a half ago, that's all been declassified.
[02:38:29.565 --> 02:38:30.365]  Trump hasn't denied it.
[02:38:33.628 --> 02:38:34.488]  Now this is happening.
[02:38:34.508 --> 02:38:35.369]  So this is real.
[02:38:36.130 --> 02:38:46.096]  And so, just like Trump delivered on trade, or the border, and the Federal Reserve tried to block him, so he got the Saudis to cut oil prices so the economy wouldn't go under, Trump is
[02:38:47.293 --> 02:38:50.836]  Fighting like a titan at 72 years of age.
[02:38:51.156 --> 02:38:52.377]  People are begging him to stop.
[02:38:52.778 --> 02:38:57.021]  He only drinks caffeinated drinks and water and stuff, but he takes no drugs, basically.
[02:38:57.641 --> 02:38:58.462]  And people are begging him.
[02:38:58.542 --> 02:38:59.723]  He doesn't sleep some nights.
[02:39:00.824 --> 02:39:02.365]  He is a maniac.
[02:39:04.707 --> 02:39:05.908]  He's the real deal.
[02:39:05.948 --> 02:39:06.829]  I'm not trying to kiss his ass.
[02:39:07.589 --> 02:39:09.791]  You should appreciate something when it's like this.
[02:39:11.272 --> 02:39:13.034]  There's at least an hour or two a week he doesn't sleep.
[02:39:17.628 --> 02:39:18.869]  That's like three Diet Cokes.
[02:39:19.630 --> 02:39:24.413]  So we should be praying for the President, like Elijah, to hold up their arms.
[02:39:24.754 --> 02:39:30.178]  Because Trump is definitely the real deal.
[02:39:30.538 --> 02:39:31.719]  He's definitely our champion.
[02:39:32.079 --> 02:39:33.721]  You know this by the way the enemy's operating.
[02:39:33.761 --> 02:39:35.062]  But let me give you the big news right now.
[02:39:38.207 --> 02:39:40.188]  And by the way, all of this isn't just my sources.
[02:39:40.228 --> 02:39:42.409]  You can reverse engineer everything I say.
[02:39:42.429 --> 02:39:44.630]  Intel's always hidden in plain view.
[02:39:44.670 --> 02:39:47.551]  You don't go off what you hear on the radio or what's telegraphed in a war.
[02:39:47.891 --> 02:39:48.951]  You go off real movements.
[02:39:55.374 --> 02:39:56.714]  And I'm going to get to those after the break.
[02:39:57.955 --> 02:40:00.276]  But right now, let me just state what's happening.
[02:40:02.697 --> 02:40:05.838]  You can pull up the articles that first 10 foreign governments
[02:40:08.703 --> 02:40:26.270]  For the first five years of Obama's administration, until Hillary left the State Department, were in all of her emails, all of her emails were private, secret, with classified stuff on purpose to avoid FOIA requests and things like that, and to not have oversight.
[02:40:26.490 --> 02:40:27.671]  It's consciously illegal.
[02:40:28.271 --> 02:40:28.891]  It's the intent.
[02:40:28.951 --> 02:40:29.751]  Not like Ivanka Trump.
[02:40:29.771 --> 02:40:30.392]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[02:40:30.412 --> 02:40:30.852]  That's their cover.
[02:40:35.518 --> 02:40:45.706]  Now we learn it was at least 18 countries, the Chinese, the Russians, the Indians, the EU, the UK, the Mexicans, everybody was in her server.
[02:40:45.726 --> 02:40:47.448]  But it was meant to be in there.
[02:40:49.169 --> 02:40:52.692]  Because she'd tell you the policy she'd done when she got a foundation payment.
[02:40:53.212 --> 02:40:56.175]  She would put disinfo in there, you name it, everybody knew what it was.
[02:40:56.715 --> 02:41:00.138]  But that's where, instead of, in the old days, you'd go if you were selling your country out,
[02:41:01.394 --> 02:41:09.578]  And you put the, you know, the submarine documents or the codes under the park bench or behind a bush or in a trash can in a McDonald's bag.
[02:41:10.558 --> 02:41:11.318]  You don't do that now.
[02:41:11.378 --> 02:41:12.779]  You just, oh, you have your own server.
[02:41:13.459 --> 02:41:14.540]  You're the Secretary of State.
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:16.861]  It's a wireless server.
[02:41:19.202 --> 02:41:21.903]  And you let everyone know what's going on.
[02:41:22.683 --> 02:41:25.204]  So you have plausible deniability, but it's really a drop box.
[02:41:25.925 --> 02:41:26.645]  So here's the big news.
[02:41:28.228 --> 02:41:44.622]  They were able to change the subject from the WikiLeaks and Hillary stealing elections and staging debates and trying to cause race war and all the money laundering and Alistair Crowley devil worshipping, kids are in the hot tub waiting for you and we've got blood and semen for you to drink.
[02:41:44.943 --> 02:41:46.924]  John Podesta, please come drink semen with us.
[02:41:46.944 --> 02:41:47.965]  I mean, that's real.
[02:41:47.985 --> 02:41:48.746]  They don't debate that.
[02:41:49.407 --> 02:41:50.187]  They just change the subject.
[02:41:50.207 --> 02:41:50.668]  The red herrings.
[02:41:54.531 --> 02:41:55.232]  And so now,
[02:41:56.843 --> 02:41:58.384]  Trump knows they're not going to back down.
[02:41:58.404 --> 02:41:59.325]  They're not going to get out of the way.
[02:41:59.645 --> 02:42:00.505]  He's got to go after them.
[02:42:01.506 --> 02:42:05.068]  And so he tweets, I'm coming after you for trials for treason.
[02:42:05.468 --> 02:42:07.029]  You're made up crap with Russiagate.
[02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:10.171]  And he's got the FISA warrants that were fraudulent.
[02:42:10.431 --> 02:42:11.932]  He's got their reverse engineering.
[02:42:12.292 --> 02:42:16.915]  He's got their parallel construction where they had illegal stuff going on spying.
[02:42:16.935 --> 02:42:19.257]  So they created a new fake and fake investigation to cover that up.
[02:42:19.417 --> 02:42:20.037]  He's the president.
[02:42:20.077 --> 02:42:21.398]  He has access to all of it now.
[02:42:21.818 --> 02:42:22.839]  And there's backups of all of it.
[02:42:22.859 --> 02:42:23.919]  They were unable to get rid of it all.
[02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:26.441]  So the president
[02:42:27.990 --> 02:42:32.674]  Trump has, and all these other agencies have, all of her 35,000 emails.
[02:42:34.336 --> 02:42:35.277]  And they've always had them.
[02:42:36.918 --> 02:42:38.920]  And they thought Trump was dumb and wouldn't learn about this.
[02:42:38.980 --> 02:42:43.964]  So now, it's all being taken from digital form and created into a transcript.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:52.402]  Google is developing an app to screen out content that the Chinese government considers too sensitive for its citizens.
[02:42:52.422 --> 02:42:52.882]  Translation?
[02:43:12.094 --> 02:43:16.758]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[02:43:16.958 --> 02:43:25.285]  China's chilling dictatorship is moving quickly to introduce social scorecards in which all citizens will be monitored 24-7 and ranked on their behavior.
[02:43:25.305 --> 02:43:31.291]  A high rating means you get benefits like no deposit of renting house or skipping airport security.
[02:43:31.511 --> 02:43:33.753]  But a low score means you can't rent a car.
[02:43:34.173 --> 02:43:35.254]  ...or apply for visas.
[02:43:35.534 --> 02:43:39.376]  The Chinese government expects to make this system mandatory in 2020.
[02:43:39.797 --> 02:43:43.919]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[02:43:43.939 --> 02:43:53.265]  The Chinese government, as people probably know, has a quite comprehensive internet censorship system set up and it's known as the Great Firewall.
[02:43:53.325 --> 02:44:00.530]  It blocks all kinds of information about, you know, political opponents of the ruling Communist Party regime there.
[02:44:00.770 --> 02:44:02.591]  All kinds of things that they're blocking out.
[02:44:02.671 --> 02:44:09.318]  Companies agreed to ban particular sites or search times on topics like human rights, democracy, and free speech.
[02:44:09.619 --> 02:44:11.361]  You know Google's really the CIA.
[02:44:12.773 --> 02:44:18.476]  But it's leftist run now, so it's brought over to China, and it's a civil war inside the intelligence agency.
[02:44:18.676 --> 02:44:27.099]  These are serious people plotting to finagle the searches, which is what Google sells to us as being fair and unbiased.
[02:44:27.239 --> 02:44:33.662]  Google alone could determine the outcome of almost any American election just by altering its search suggestions.
[02:44:34.083 --> 02:44:35.043]  We'd never know what happened.
[02:44:35.043 --> 02:44:44.577]  Well, Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[02:44:44.617 --> 02:44:46.380]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:48.483]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon?
[02:44:49.565 --> 02:44:57.273]  On artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China, and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[02:44:57.353 --> 02:45:05.861]  So they're working on behalf of the fascist Chinese government, sending propaganda to its people to keep them under the control of the government.
[02:45:05.881 --> 02:45:09.585]  But we shouldn't worry about the fact that they have a chokehold on all human information in English.
[02:45:09.765 --> 02:45:10.366]  Not a big deal.
[02:45:11.066 --> 02:45:12.708]  I mean, that's a lot you just said there.
[02:45:15.311 --> 02:45:21.637]  So Google always swears that its liberal, anti-Trump views of the top people doesn't affect the search product.
[02:45:22.158 --> 02:45:27.603]  But here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[02:45:27.623 --> 02:45:32.228]  The Chinese government, let's remember, imprisons dissidents and Christians daily.
[02:45:32.608 --> 02:45:36.592]  They have more than a million Muslims in re-education camps.
[02:45:36.972 --> 02:45:42.634]  But the legitimate election of President Trump somehow conflicts with Google's vaunted values?
[02:45:43.234 --> 02:45:44.895]  Give me a break.
[02:45:45.175 --> 02:45:47.615]  Google was working to get Hillary Clinton elected.
[02:45:47.756 --> 02:45:59.179]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[02:45:59.319 --> 02:46:01.720]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary
[02:46:01.800 --> 02:46:08.587]  Clinton's leaked emails were likely responsible for the deaths of up to 20 CIA agents working in China.
[02:46:08.747 --> 02:46:14.133]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[02:46:14.253 --> 02:46:18.258]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people
[02:46:18.558 --> 02:46:23.501]  They're outright manning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[02:46:23.641 --> 02:46:33.528]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[02:46:33.688 --> 02:46:36.609]  You're not allowed to get the InfoWars official app on your iPhone?
[02:46:36.629 --> 02:46:41.733]  You're not allowed to watch the Alex Jones Show on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook?
[02:46:42.529 --> 02:46:54.292]  But if you're the Chinese government, and you want access to every citizen, and all their data, and everything they've ever done on an Apple product, good to go, baby.
[02:46:55.312 --> 02:46:55.932]  Good to go.
[02:46:56.612 --> 02:46:59.673]  And the left in America loves it.
[02:47:06.694 --> 02:47:09.335]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:35.287 --> 02:47:38.748]  Alright, let's get serious.
[02:47:59.544 --> 02:48:27.876]  You understand, we're in 2018, late November, 28th day of November, 2018, and the President's tweeting that we need to arrest for treason and have trials for Comey, Mueller, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Uba Abedin, former Attorney General,
[02:48:28.729 --> 02:48:29.410]  Loretta Lynch.
[02:48:31.712 --> 02:48:32.592]  Rod Rosenstein.
[02:48:36.256 --> 02:48:37.697]  Picture tells a thousand words, doesn't it?
[02:48:39.799 --> 02:48:40.920]  And what did I tell you on Sunday?
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:42.341]  I said, he's coming for them.
[02:48:43.162 --> 02:48:45.804]  Because we know what we're talking about.
[02:48:45.824 --> 02:48:53.671]  Exclusive Trump said to indict Hillary Clinton and other deep state, deep staters in the coming months.
[02:48:56.434 --> 02:48:57.215]  So what's happening here?
[02:48:57.435 --> 02:49:00.637]  Well, I'm telling you from all my sources, but I don't just trust my sources.
[02:49:00.677 --> 02:49:03.359]  I'm going to get to why I know it's absolutely true in a moment.
[02:49:07.703 --> 02:49:21.393]  That the President is moving with Whitaker, the acting Attorney General, to go after them because they have them dead to rights, not just on the illegal server, not just on the emails that they have, the 35,000 that of course they had.
[02:49:23.410 --> 02:49:26.712]  The Intel Committee and others have said, no, we got him, we know who was getting him, we know what she did.
[02:49:27.713 --> 02:49:28.233]  That's what's crazy.
[02:49:28.273 --> 02:49:33.197]  They've got all the dirt on them and they won't back off and just let America move on and keep their money and go away.
[02:49:33.557 --> 02:49:40.262]  They keep wanting to take down Trump and have the Federal Reserve raise interest rates and have GM, even though it's making its biggest profits ever, move to China.
[02:49:41.322 --> 02:49:43.024]  Even though we bailed them out and gave them subsidies.
[02:49:43.044 --> 02:49:46.466]  Trump's like, screw you, I'll put $4,000 on every GM vehicle.
[02:49:47.887 --> 02:49:50.089]  They said, well, we're betting on China, not America.
[02:49:50.129 --> 02:49:51.970]  I just saw that on the news during the break.
[02:49:53.373 --> 02:49:55.354]  We're betting on a post-vehicle future.
[02:49:58.356 --> 02:50:00.998]  So, here's the big takeaway.
[02:50:01.278 --> 02:50:02.399]  Trump's making his move.
[02:50:02.559 --> 02:50:03.619]  We better get behind him.
[02:50:03.719 --> 02:50:07.001]  And you better realize that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:50:07.582 --> 02:50:09.203]  And that's why the system is so upset.
[02:50:09.243 --> 02:50:12.725]  Because, yeah, in the past, Republicans and Democrats would scratch each other's backs.
[02:50:12.765 --> 02:50:13.586]  It was all incestuous.
[02:50:13.946 --> 02:50:15.267]  That's all come to an end here.
[02:50:16.207 --> 02:50:17.368]  Trump is the real deal.
[02:50:19.440 --> 02:50:30.724]  And you know that by his actions, you know it by his enemies, you know it by their mutinies, and by all these cowardly people that are double-dealing and trying to play both sides of the fence, betting on the fact that the swamps always won.
[02:50:32.024 --> 02:50:34.385]  I'll tell you this, I've looked at every possible outcome.
[02:50:35.285 --> 02:50:38.206]  Even if they take Trump out, take us all out, their globalism fails.
[02:50:38.246 --> 02:50:41.147]  They don't have any future except getting out of the way.
[02:50:41.687 --> 02:50:45.069]  And now, that time has passed.
[02:50:45.169 --> 02:50:45.649]  The time
[02:50:47.213 --> 02:50:49.295]  We've had many seasons of men not being men.
[02:50:49.315 --> 02:50:53.518]  We've had many, many decades of the average person not having to actually stamp or something.
[02:50:53.838 --> 02:50:58.241]  But that's been a distortion.
[02:50:59.222 --> 02:51:00.263]  That's been an anomaly.
[02:51:00.643 --> 02:51:01.884]  That's all going to leave now.
[02:51:04.906 --> 02:51:09.330]  And on the current trajectory, in the next few weeks,
[02:51:10.848 --> 02:51:13.029]  This is definitely hanging over their head right now.
[02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:18.012]  Just like Trump said, I'm going to declassify how you illegally surveilled me during the campaign and how you lied about the Congress.
[02:51:18.032 --> 02:51:21.294]  And then they made a deal and said, Rosenstein said, we're going to back off.
[02:51:21.314 --> 02:51:21.995]  We're going to stop.
[02:51:22.055 --> 02:51:22.975]  We know you're not a Russian.
[02:51:23.475 --> 02:51:24.216]  And Trump said, good.
[02:51:24.256 --> 02:51:26.477]  And they came right back and double-crossed Trump.
[02:51:26.857 --> 02:51:27.938]  And Trump said, that's it.
[02:51:29.579 --> 02:51:32.541]  And Trump told everybody loyal to this country, choose what damn side you're on.
[02:51:32.561 --> 02:51:33.221]  We're going to war.
[02:51:34.442 --> 02:51:35.863]  And that was about two weeks ago.
[02:51:39.989 --> 02:51:41.890]  And Trump saw all the election fraud, the rest of it.
[02:51:42.651 --> 02:51:43.592]  He's got all the intel.
[02:51:45.233 --> 02:51:45.773]  And it's over.
[02:51:47.574 --> 02:51:48.755]  All these globalists want to fight?
[02:51:49.295 --> 02:51:49.856]  They've got one.
[02:51:50.796 --> 02:51:55.059]  And they're going to release to Congress the fact that Hillary's emails have been discovered.
[02:51:56.821 --> 02:51:58.862]  And then they're going to start leaking what's in them.
[02:52:03.085 --> 02:52:04.686]  But it's going to get a lot worse than that.
[02:52:07.577 --> 02:52:11.618]  But the point is, we've now, like, two armies on two hills going down to a valley to fight.
[02:52:11.818 --> 02:52:13.138]  The armies are now coming down.
[02:52:13.338 --> 02:52:13.678]  It's on.
[02:52:15.219 --> 02:52:16.499]  And that's what life's all about.
[02:52:17.299 --> 02:52:19.360]  Not always just being stagnant, being yes-men.
[02:52:19.780 --> 02:52:21.660]  Don't be scared as we march down into the valley.
[02:52:21.680 --> 02:52:24.281]  The valley of death.
[02:52:26.342 --> 02:52:30.082]  Because in the valley of death, there's a stream that flows in it.
[02:52:31.863 --> 02:52:36.504]  And none of that stream that goes out to the ocean is the ocean of life.
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:38.900]  The Tree of Liberty.
[02:52:40.181 --> 02:52:43.543]  Think of a tree as above ground, but think of the ocean as a big, giant tree.
[02:52:44.984 --> 02:52:50.888]  The blood that flows from patriots and tyrants out to the sea feeds the greater system.
[02:52:51.368 --> 02:52:57.812]  And it's the denial of that, it's the entropy and the giving into the corruption and lying to yourself that makes you lose your soul.
[02:52:59.193 --> 02:53:04.516]  It's the standing up to this and telling the truth that makes you find your soul.
[02:53:06.197 --> 02:53:07.458]  So, how are they going to strike back?
[02:53:08.379 --> 02:53:10.540]  You've seen it the last week or so, but now it's fever pitch.
[02:53:10.740 --> 02:53:12.000]  Firestorm!
[02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:17.022]  Ivanka Trump says there's no equivalency between her emails and Hillary Clinton's.
[02:53:17.642 --> 02:53:20.623]  The Clinton State Department major security breach that everyone is ignoring.
[02:53:22.163 --> 02:53:24.384]  Foreign actors access Hillary Clinton's emails.
[02:53:24.624 --> 02:53:24.844]  Memo.
[02:53:26.818 --> 02:53:34.881]  But here comes Ivanka in, is doing PR stuff and kind of ambassadorial, taking people out to dinner and promoting policy to them.
[02:53:34.901 --> 02:53:37.522]  And she's in her email, you know, to the White House.
[02:53:37.562 --> 02:53:38.422]  She wasn't hiding it.
[02:53:38.662 --> 02:53:39.663]  She wasn't destroying it.
[02:53:40.023 --> 02:53:42.624]  She was sending emails to governmental people on her email.
[02:53:43.484 --> 02:53:46.185]  Because Hillary had a top-secret security clearance out of the State Department.
[02:53:47.435 --> 02:53:52.438]  Hillary was operating with a secret server and doing world business and classified info on that.
[02:53:52.778 --> 02:53:53.618]  Ivanka Trump wasn't.
[02:53:53.658 --> 02:53:55.219]  But I'm not defending Ivanka Trump.
[02:53:55.459 --> 02:54:01.342]  That turns into distraction when you see them all over the news saying Ivanka is equivalent of Hillary.
[02:54:01.802 --> 02:54:08.166]  That's so the story becomes Ivanka is equivalent to Hillary with not secret servers but using her private email.
[02:54:09.686 --> 02:54:13.508]  Just like we talk about who stole the WikiLeaks versus what's in the WikiLeaks.
[02:54:13.829 --> 02:54:16.190]  They changed the subject and make the whole thing about that.
[02:54:17.403 --> 02:54:34.503]  So the fact that you see Fever Pitch obsessing a year and a half later, two years later, that Ivanka Trump had her own private email server, that's another sign that the intel we're getting, that we know the government has her emails, we know it's there, we know foreign governments have it, and are obviously blackmailing with it.
[02:54:37.347 --> 02:54:43.312]  All of that is getting ready to come out, and it's just confirmed by them hyperventilating about Ivanka Trump and trying to smokescreen.
[02:54:43.332 --> 02:54:45.694]  It isn't about who was using private email.
[02:54:46.035 --> 02:54:51.920]  It's about what you were doing with the private email, what you destroyed, what you had that was classified, and what your intent was.
[02:54:52.740 --> 02:54:54.362]  And it's about the contents of it.
[02:54:55.423 --> 02:55:01.148]  But moving on from that, we're now in the position where the President of the United States of America
[02:55:02.555 --> 02:55:28.503]  is sending out tweets to tens of millions of people showing Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Robert Mueller, James Comey, Uma Abedin, Loretta Lynch, and all the usual suspects behind bars saying we need treason trials for them trying to overthrow our election and trying to overthrow this country and they're all globalists working against this nation.
[02:55:30.985 --> 02:55:33.667]  That, my friends, is spectacular news.
[02:55:34.727 --> 02:55:36.128]  That, my friends, is important.
[02:55:36.688 --> 02:55:39.150]  And then I've got this whole stack of news right here.
[02:55:39.170 --> 02:55:43.612]  This was linked on DrudgeReport.com today.
[02:55:43.652 --> 02:55:46.394]  Between 6,000 and 10,000 churches in the U.S.
[02:55:46.734 --> 02:55:51.257]  are dying each year, and that means that over 100 will die this week.
[02:55:52.898 --> 02:55:56.040]  YouGov polls reveals epidemic of anti-Americanism.
[02:55:56.060 --> 02:55:57.661]  1 in 5 Americans view U.S.
[02:55:57.701 --> 02:55:58.561]  flag as symbol of hate.
[02:55:58.581 --> 02:55:59.942]  1 in 3 believe it's okay to burn it.
[02:56:01.713 --> 02:56:09.580]  And it's not that America is perfect, but we're being taught by our media to hate the country, so we have no system that stands up for us, so we can be robbed by globalists and multinationals.
[02:56:10.621 --> 02:56:12.142]  Don't worry, the caravan migrants accuse U.S.
[02:56:12.162 --> 02:56:18.968]  border agents of repression and demand their list of demands that everything be free.
[02:56:20.677 --> 02:56:22.798]  We act like a bunch of weak chumps, we'll be overrun.
[02:56:22.838 --> 02:56:23.398]  It's that simple.
[02:56:23.418 --> 02:56:24.738]  We've got our reporters on the ground.
[02:56:25.518 --> 02:56:28.319]  The caravan is set Thursday or Friday to try to attack again.
[02:56:28.339 --> 02:56:29.999]  Their numbers are five, six times what they were.
[02:56:30.439 --> 02:56:32.340]  This is all about globalism to set the precedent.
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:32.980]  We have no border.
[02:56:33.260 --> 02:56:40.042]  We'll be covering it here at newswars.com and infowars.com on these local radio stations and TV stations you're listening and watching to us on.
[02:56:40.062 --> 02:56:41.802]  And it's so critical you spread the word on that.
[02:56:43.271 --> 02:56:48.754]  But we just laid out the gigantic trillion pound enchilada here that Trump is moving against him.
[02:56:49.375 --> 02:56:51.916]  He's got all the evidence, but they're going to counter-strike.
[02:56:52.517 --> 02:56:53.517]  And it's going to be incredible.
[02:56:53.577 --> 02:56:56.039]  And it's going to start with Uma Abedin, who's now being questioned.
[02:56:56.419 --> 02:56:59.661]  And the copy of the server they got with her, they don't want to admit they have it from their own means.
[02:57:00.021 --> 02:57:02.543]  So they're going to say they got it from her laptop, which it was there.
[02:57:02.563 --> 02:57:03.964]  And that all got covered up.
[02:57:04.144 --> 02:57:05.545]  So it's all about to unfold.
[02:57:05.865 --> 02:57:06.505]  Get ready for that.
[02:57:07.006 --> 02:57:10.048]  Oh, don't forget, Cyber Week's going right now.

[02:57:20.031 --> 02:57:21.212]  God helps those that help themselves.

[02:59:18.781 --> 02:59:22.724]  Jam it down their throat as a badge of honor to be demonized and lied about.
[02:59:22.964 --> 02:59:30.188]  Of the collaborators and the cowards and the filth that have all signed on to worshipping the pedophilia and worshipping the devil worship.
[02:59:30.408 --> 02:59:31.069]  Well guess what?
[02:59:31.189 --> 02:59:41.895]  I'm real proud to be enemy number one up against these people and thank God for Trump flying that banner of Americana and no compromise and no compromise for Christianity and everything.
[02:59:42.095 --> 02:59:43.176]  God bless President Trump.
[02:59:43.516 --> 02:59:48.839]  I'm proud to stand by and watch all the other cowards hedge their bets and double talk behind the President's back.
[02:59:49.119 --> 02:59:49.480]  Not me!
[02:59:56.596 --> 02:59:58.257]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:58.597 --> 03:00:03.198]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:08.320 --> 03:00:10.300]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:12.041]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.774 --> 03:00:37.785]  I'm gonna get Roger Stone, former chief political advisor to President Trump, I'm gonna get his take on it next segment when he joins us, but man, wow, the president tweeting an image of the Deep Staters behind bars.
[03:00:39.447 --> 03:00:44.911]  I also announced at the start of the show that at the end of my hosting I would announce the winner.
[03:00:46.758 --> 03:00:50.922]  And I had given the computer printouts and things a couple hours ago to the crew.
[03:00:52.023 --> 03:00:54.846]  Will you guys bring me those computer printouts, please?
[03:00:55.406 --> 03:01:01.532]  And then I am going to play that piece coming up in the next segment.
[03:01:03.132 --> 03:01:05.353]  So we'll get that downloaded and do that.
[03:01:05.373 --> 03:01:06.194]  There's a lot going on.
[03:01:06.214 --> 03:01:09.395]  I'm sorry I'm announcing this contest two or three weeks after I was supposed to.
[03:01:09.435 --> 03:01:10.656]  We always pay out of the contest.
[03:01:10.676 --> 03:01:15.558]  There's one winner, $10,000, and we've got their NPC meme winner.
[03:01:16.179 --> 03:01:28.645]  But I would like to see everybody go to DrudgeReport.com or Infowars.com and make your own version of the image that Trump tweeted out that shows the deep state being locked up in prison.
[03:01:29.295 --> 03:01:33.277]  Again, the media's spitting it that he's a dictator, that he wants to shut people's speech down, that he's a horrible person.
[03:01:33.297 --> 03:01:35.539]  No, they're the ones trying to overthrow the election and do all this.
[03:01:35.819 --> 03:01:43.483]  He's saying, now that Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[03:01:44.284 --> 03:01:49.446]  For the illegal spy, for trying to overthrow the election, for trying to basically keep their political party in power.
[03:01:49.506 --> 03:01:50.327]  That is treason.
[03:01:52.108 --> 03:01:57.171]  Everybody should make their own images of that and send them to Showtips at Infowars.
[03:01:59.947 --> 03:02:13.032]  But I will, coming up, if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek, I am going to play the winning MPC video here for you on air.
[03:02:14.373 --> 03:02:20.015]  You know, I kind of thought it was the winner a couple weeks ago that I got busy, and then this morning we watched it again, and I said, yeah, that's it.
[03:02:20.415 --> 03:02:25.237]  And again, the crew is super busy, and I said, end of the show, have that video on the computer, we're going to play it.
[03:02:25.317 --> 03:02:26.498]  In fact, do we have that video on the computer?
[03:02:31.223 --> 03:02:32.744]  You can almost hear the Jeopardy music.
[03:02:34.685 --> 03:02:37.246]  Next segment though.
[03:02:37.547 --> 03:02:48.553]  And then I need to print out, when we said here are the, the printout I did earlier about three hours ago, the printout that says, here is the finalist.
[03:02:49.533 --> 03:02:56.657]  And then we'll just repost that finalist article with the video of me announcing the winner, and we'll do that.
[03:02:56.677 --> 03:02:59.819]  Because see, we're doing so much here that we kind of all do it on the fly.
[03:03:00.834 --> 03:03:10.196]  And then you can see how months go by, sometimes, because I'll say something and then so much news breaks and so many epic things happen that it's easy for me to forget.
[03:03:10.276 --> 03:03:12.937]  But I'm not gonna forget today.
[03:03:14.137 --> 03:03:19.959]  Today will be the day, one way or another, we're gonna play that video.
[03:03:21.759 --> 03:03:24.480]  And one way or another, we're gonna send that person $10,000.
[03:03:26.971 --> 03:03:36.218]  In one way or another, we're going to post an article about how they won on NewsWars.com and on InfoWars.com.
[03:03:38.039 --> 03:03:38.840]  And it's going to happen.
[03:03:40.541 --> 03:03:47.867]  Now, we're going to go to break, and when we come back on the other side, Roger Stone's here, with the insanity.
[03:03:47.927 --> 03:03:55.093]  Fox News all last night was about Dr. Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone, and then InfoWars in the middle of it, and just a swirling insanity.
[03:03:55.693 --> 03:03:56.754]  But that's not even the story.
[03:03:58.126 --> 03:04:03.528]  It's Trump tweeting, but the gloves are off, and we need treason charges for these folks.
[03:04:03.628 --> 03:04:13.731]  That tells you everything you need to know, and we're going to cover that front and center when we come back on the other side, and then we're going to play.
[03:04:16.832 --> 03:04:17.312]  Or maybe not.
[03:04:17.632 --> 03:04:17.992]  Who knows?
[03:04:18.952 --> 03:04:24.254]  We're going to play who the winner is, and a great job they did on the NPC meme, but whatever you do, it's not about winning $10,000.
[03:04:24.294 --> 03:04:25.714]  Great job, by the way, the winner.
[03:04:28.089 --> 03:04:29.250]  Or do I pun another month?
[03:04:29.310 --> 03:04:29.751]  Give me a word.
[03:04:29.791 --> 03:04:30.231]  Pun another month?
[03:04:30.251 --> 03:04:31.272]  I can pun another month.
[03:04:32.113 --> 03:04:32.413]  I can do it.
[03:04:32.433 --> 03:04:33.494]  Oh, we're good.
[03:04:33.514 --> 03:04:33.854]  Okay, good.
[03:04:34.094 --> 03:04:40.340]  I just... Sounds like Houston's down there and I'm kind of like up here on air and I'm not sure what's going on.
[03:04:41.041 --> 03:04:43.563]  Oh, and by the way, China's threatening military action against the U.S.
[03:04:43.583 --> 03:04:46.906]  because they want 100% tariffs on us and none on them.
[03:04:46.926 --> 03:04:49.408]  They're like, we here to screw you!
[03:04:49.468 --> 03:04:50.149]  You bend over!
[03:04:50.209 --> 03:04:50.689]  Ha ha ha!
[03:04:50.729 --> 03:04:51.971]  We kill our own people!
[03:04:52.831 --> 03:04:54.092]  So, that's going on.
[03:04:55.123 --> 03:04:56.925]  It's all coming up with Roger Stone.
[03:04:57.525 --> 03:04:59.266]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:59.707 --> 03:05:00.808]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:12.257]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:05:12.437 --> 03:05:13.698]  Believe me, I know.
[03:05:13.898 --> 03:05:18.222]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:05:18.242 --> 03:05:23.666]  But thanks to super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:05:23.886 --> 03:05:44.134]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:05:44.634 --> 03:05:48.396]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:05:57.361 --> 03:05:59.342]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:06:00.102 --> 03:06:01.343]  Supermail Vitality.
[03:06:01.363 --> 03:06:02.564]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:02.624 --> 03:06:08.707]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[03:06:16.141 --> 03:06:18.223]  He never gives up.
[03:06:18.363 --> 03:06:24.427]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[03:06:24.807 --> 03:06:31.412]  Well, I thought the day I met you, you were meek as a lamb.
[03:06:32.372 --> 03:06:35.655]  Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans.
[03:06:37.461 --> 03:06:40.404]  Okay, we are definitely living in historic times.
[03:06:40.424 --> 03:06:43.907]  I mean, all times are historic, but this is really historic right now.
[03:06:43.967 --> 03:06:50.352]  And I want to go right to the meat and potatoes.
[03:06:50.432 --> 03:06:53.755]  It's on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:07:05.891 --> 03:07:08.132]  It's on NewsWorks.com, and it's what everybody wanted.
[03:07:09.192 --> 03:07:24.759]  It's President Trump saying, well, Russiagate's totally made up, and we know that now, and so do we need treason charges against the deep state that have been illegally spying on Trump, the American people, trying to overturn the election.
[03:07:24.799 --> 03:07:26.820]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[03:07:26.880 --> 03:07:31.622]  On Sunday night, I put out the headline, Trump set to indict Hillary
[03:07:32.751 --> 03:07:35.992]  And other deep staters in the coming months, because you could see the preparation.
[03:07:36.332 --> 03:07:37.873]  You could see him getting the new Attorney General in.
[03:07:38.433 --> 03:07:48.496]  And you could also see them freaking out about Ivanka Trump and her private email that was done for PR, kind of ambassadorial stuff, which is not illegal.
[03:07:49.337 --> 03:07:54.578]  Hillary was the head of the State Department, super classified, doing it all on purpose with fake names to sell data.
[03:07:54.979 --> 03:07:55.579]  That's totally different.
[03:07:55.599 --> 03:08:01.601]  But now that the fact they're hyping, oh, it's no big deal, Hillary's emails, because the word is the 30 plus thousand emails,
[03:08:02.481 --> 03:08:05.904]  That other governments grabbed, the Pentagon grabbed, and Trump knows all that now.
[03:08:05.985 --> 03:08:18.697]  And a little birdie told me, not just Congressman Nunes, who's been saying they've got total proof of criminal activity, but little birdies told me the Pentagon is, it's all being transcribed right now and delivered to Congress in the next week.
[03:08:19.518 --> 03:08:22.240]  So you talk about beyond a shot across the bow.
[03:08:23.468 --> 03:08:30.312]  Here ladies and gentlemen because it's not just those emails are criminal the content is criminal But we can see the Ivanka Trump thing.
[03:08:30.332 --> 03:08:36.995]  They're trying to use that to make it the same thing as crimes Hillary committed Ivanka Having her own email.
[03:08:37.375 --> 03:08:41.598]  These were not classified emails in the State Department She wasn't erasing them.
[03:08:41.978 --> 03:08:43.239]  She wasn't doing all this on purpose.
[03:08:43.279 --> 03:08:44.539]  So Roger Stone.
[03:08:44.659 --> 03:08:45.900]  What do you make of this?
[03:08:46.040 --> 03:08:47.501]  What does this signal?
[03:08:49.315 --> 03:09:00.904]  That Trump has put this tweet out, that Trump has been talking about locking him up, saying that soon we'll learn who the heroes are, and that Robert Mueller isn't one of them.
[03:09:01.565 --> 03:09:08.570]  I mean, the word is, like Nunes has said, they're not just about to release the illegal surveillance in the line of Congress.
[03:09:09.191 --> 03:09:14.455]  Have you gotten the same intel I've gotten, that they're about to release the fact that they have Hillary's missing emails?
[03:09:16.595 --> 03:09:19.398]  There's certainly something bigger afoot here, Alex.
[03:09:19.438 --> 03:09:21.060]  I think you're absolutely right about that.
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:25.465]  Part of this equation, I suspect, is the fact that we're now learning
[03:09:26.420 --> 03:09:41.997]  That the president had joint defense agreements with both Paul Manafort and Jerry Corsi, which means now he's heard firsthand about the treatment of those two gentlemen and the intent and the direction of the Mueller inquiry.
[03:09:42.117 --> 03:09:48.884]  And perhaps the president finally understands that this is a speeding bullet heading directly for his head.
[03:09:49.935 --> 03:09:55.616]  He is the real target here, not Stone, not Alex Jones, not Jerry Corsi.
[03:09:56.056 --> 03:09:58.477]  No, the real target is Donald Trump.
[03:09:58.517 --> 03:10:03.498]  And his cowardly advisors have been telling him it's not the case all along, but now he knows it's all a fraud.
[03:10:03.538 --> 03:10:06.939]  He's like, Mueller's giving uranium to Russians on tarmac.
[03:10:06.999 --> 03:10:08.519]  Hillary's a Chinese spy.
[03:10:09.679 --> 03:10:11.300]  So now Trump gets he's got to move.
[03:10:12.420 --> 03:10:13.840]  I think that's what it means.
[03:10:13.900 --> 03:10:16.521]  I mean, I'm really surprised that he has not.
[03:10:18.276 --> 03:10:39.018]  Had Matthew Whitaker appoint a special prosecutor, Andrew McCarthy, Judge Andrew Napolitano, Judge Jeanine Pirro, who is a former prosecuting district attorney, as a special counsel to look into Uranium One and the use of the illegal FISA warrants to spy on the Trump campaign.
[03:10:40.598 --> 03:10:45.640]  But what does it signify him tweeting, we'll put the image from Infowars.com and The Hill, all of it.
[03:10:46.461 --> 03:10:50.703]  He's not calling for their arrest, he's calling for their investigation, their indictment, their trial.
[03:10:51.003 --> 03:10:52.724]  They've all nakedly committed these crimes.
[03:10:53.064 --> 03:10:54.525]  I think this signals where Trump's going.
[03:10:54.545 --> 03:10:55.265]  This is a big deal.
[03:10:56.346 --> 03:11:01.648]  I think that it is a signal that the President finally sees the big picture.
[03:11:01.908 --> 03:11:07.411]  And the fact that, as we've been saying here on Infowars for almost two years,
[03:11:08.340 --> 03:11:21.265]  The whole Russian narrative, the Russian collusion, delusion, was meant as a distraction from the larger crimes of the Obama, Clinton, Bush regime.
[03:11:22.145 --> 03:11:28.748]  It was meant as a distraction for Uranium One, the largest treasonous financial crime in American history.
[03:11:29.168 --> 03:11:37.871]  It was meant as a distraction from the abuse of power in the use of the surveillance authority and capability of the state.
[03:11:38.411 --> 03:11:39.971]  against Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:11:40.512 --> 03:11:47.393]  It was meant as a distraction from the Obama FBI infiltration of Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:11:47.894 --> 03:11:55.816]  What better way to avoid detection for your own crimes than to try to point out faux criminality by someone else?
[03:11:55.836 --> 03:12:04.078]  And I was about to say, Roger, the brazen, naked chutzpah, the bravado, whatever you want to call it, of
[03:12:05.350 --> 03:12:16.302]  Hillary and Mueller and them all deep in bed with the Russians and the Chinese and selling America out and hating the country to then try to project that onto their political enemies.
[03:12:16.442 --> 03:12:19.165]  It's just reeks of megalomania.
[03:12:20.166 --> 03:12:26.833]  But the reason they did it, Alex, the reason they thought they could get away with it is because they had willing handmaidens in the mainstream media press.
[03:12:27.631 --> 03:12:30.452]  That's why they're so desperate to close Infowars down.
[03:12:30.972 --> 03:12:36.954]  That's why they're so desperate to censor conservative Republican or pro-Trump voices on the internet.
[03:12:37.374 --> 03:12:44.757]  Because it's only with that mainstream media monopoly that they can keep the cover up of their crimes secure.
[03:12:45.730 --> 03:12:53.175]  They knew that the only one raising the questions about their criminality would be Donald Trump, and that it would not get amplified in the media.
[03:12:53.195 --> 03:12:54.356]  Sure, well that's my next point.
[03:12:54.636 --> 03:13:00.560]  It was you and Roger Stone, off of mainstream New York Times articles from years before, back when I did their job.
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:03.662]  Hillary's Russia problem, Hillary's Uranium One problem.
[03:13:04.202 --> 03:13:08.465]  You guys were just, already knew it, but Destin and the Foundation was obviously pay to play.
[03:13:09.125 --> 03:13:23.160]  So the fact that Robert Mueller and Hillary and her former top lawyer are the ones going after all of us, when they're literally going after journalists that expose their Russia connection, it's so incredible.
[03:13:24.541 --> 03:13:29.086]  Well, when it was revealed roughly 10 days ago that the woman attorney
[03:13:29.807 --> 03:13:46.839]  Working for the Mueller probe, who was leading the inquisition and potential prosecution of Roger Stone, was Jeannie Rhee, who represented the Clinton Foundation, who was a donor to Hillary Clinton, who was essentially Hillary Clinton's personal legal attack dog.
[03:13:47.439 --> 03:13:48.479]  Where was that covered?
[03:13:48.959 --> 03:13:49.740]  Info Wars?
[03:13:50.180 --> 03:13:51.120]  The Daily Caller?
[03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:52.700]  Big League Politics?
[03:13:53.121 --> 03:13:54.221]  Gateway Pundit?
[03:13:54.761 --> 03:13:55.361]  Breitbart?
[03:13:55.861 --> 03:13:57.182]  Where was it not covered?
[03:13:57.262 --> 03:13:58.562]  Not even ever mentioned?
[03:13:58.942 --> 03:13:59.862]  The New York Times?
[03:14:00.202 --> 03:14:01.323]  The Washington Post?
[03:14:01.663 --> 03:14:02.763]  The Wall Street Journal?
[03:14:03.063 --> 03:14:03.683]  ABC?
[03:14:03.863 --> 03:14:04.444]  NBC?
[03:14:04.504 --> 03:14:05.104]  CBS?
[03:14:05.164 --> 03:14:05.744]  CNN?
[03:14:06.204 --> 03:14:10.565]  You see, it's a classic example of why they are so brazen.
[03:14:10.985 --> 03:14:13.526]  Because the mainstream media has their back,
[03:14:14.246 --> 03:14:21.750]  And the alternative media that supports us, they're actively acting to censor so that we have no voice.
[03:14:21.830 --> 03:14:25.933]  I agree, but the good news is Trump's taking the gloves off and that means he's going to take them off.
[03:14:25.973 --> 03:14:28.094]  They're talking about antitrust against Apple, Google.
[03:14:28.474 --> 03:14:29.535]  It's all about to happen.
[03:14:29.635 --> 03:14:31.216]  What do you expect the deep state to do now?
[03:14:31.336 --> 03:14:34.097]  I see this moment as the maximum danger point.
[03:14:34.117 --> 03:14:35.758]  I mean, this is the thick of the battle.
[03:14:36.078 --> 03:14:37.059]  This is the heart of the battle.
[03:14:38.195 --> 03:14:38.996]  You're absolutely right.
[03:14:39.036 --> 03:14:46.140]  That's why they're suddenly leaking fake stories about Paul Manafort meeting with Julian Assange in London in March of 2016.
[03:14:47.380 --> 03:14:48.401]  Completely false.
[03:14:48.941 --> 03:14:55.305]  They're now trying to match up every time I've been on InfoWars and mentioned that I spoke to Donald Trump in 2016 or 2015.
[03:14:57.486 --> 03:15:05.630]  They're now trying to match that up with things the president said in public to try to prove that there's some connection between the two when there isn't.
[03:15:05.750 --> 03:15:15.475]  I mean, this is, we're now to the point where Mr. Mueller and his associates are shaking every tree because Paul Manafort won't tell them what they want to hear.
[03:15:16.135 --> 03:15:20.357]  Jerry Corsi, at least to some extent, won't tell them what they want to hear.
[03:15:21.178 --> 03:15:23.399]  And therefore, they have no Russian collusion.
[03:15:23.939 --> 03:15:25.200]  The target is not
[03:15:25.780 --> 03:15:32.671]  Roger Stone or Alex Jones or Jerry Corsi, the target is Donald Trump and they have no bullets.
[03:15:32.992 --> 03:15:33.813]  That's where we are.
[03:15:35.626 --> 03:15:39.989]  And the media keeps saying, don't criticize Mueller, this political whore.
[03:15:40.649 --> 03:15:43.251]  That's, whatever they tell you not to do is what you should be doing.
[03:15:43.611 --> 03:15:51.916]  So let's talk about what Trump should do straight ahead and how he's going to counter-strike because they now know they are in the political crosshairs big time, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:52.376 --> 03:15:55.979]  This is an incredible historic point in our country.
[03:15:55.999 --> 03:15:59.421]  I mean, you could cut the suspense with a knife.
[03:16:02.953 --> 03:16:05.094]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[03:16:05.154 --> 03:16:10.916]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[03:16:11.016 --> 03:16:13.437]  Thank you for telling me that.
[03:16:13.577 --> 03:16:15.558]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[03:16:16.178 --> 03:16:18.459]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[03:16:18.519 --> 03:16:19.780]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:24.802]  But do you think that you demonized- Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist!
[03:16:26.212 --> 03:16:31.496]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[03:16:32.437 --> 03:16:34.959]  But, of course, the caravan does exist.
[03:16:35.539 --> 03:16:37.881]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[03:16:38.301 --> 03:16:42.945]  More than 10,000, as of today, are already massing on the border.
[03:16:43.465 --> 03:16:52.052]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground, sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[03:16:53.093 --> 03:16:54.054]  But just think about that.
[03:16:54.813 --> 03:17:04.739]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[03:17:05.140 --> 03:17:09.302]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[03:17:09.582 --> 03:17:16.027]  At first they said, oh, the caravans are all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[03:17:16.943 --> 03:17:17.844]  They deserve to be here.
[03:17:18.124 --> 03:17:19.745]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[03:17:19.765 --> 03:17:21.206]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[03:17:21.246 --> 03:17:21.847]  You're crazy.
[03:17:22.467 --> 03:17:24.088]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[03:17:24.609 --> 03:17:32.454]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[03:17:32.575 --> 03:17:35.116]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[03:17:35.737 --> 03:17:44.964]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[03:17:45.932 --> 03:17:47.674]  And the lies go on and on from there.
[03:17:47.914 --> 03:17:53.119]  And that's why Infowars.com and Newswars.com existing is so critical.
[03:17:53.739 --> 03:18:04.189]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it.
[03:18:04.649 --> 03:18:05.490]  All the things they're doing.
[03:18:06.211 --> 03:18:08.793]  Saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist.
[03:18:09.273 --> 03:18:09.914]  All this 1984 garbage.
[03:18:12.125 --> 03:18:14.388]  I can't stand being challenged at all.
[03:18:14.508 --> 03:18:28.964]  And that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big mega-corporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others, working in concert to shut down.
[03:18:30.069 --> 03:18:39.392]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[03:18:39.773 --> 03:18:48.956]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[03:18:49.776 --> 03:18:51.658]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[03:18:51.758 --> 03:18:53.179]  This is sick.
[03:18:53.580 --> 03:18:56.202]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[03:18:56.683 --> 03:18:58.804]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[03:18:59.485 --> 03:19:01.787]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[03:19:02.168 --> 03:19:04.370]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:05.050 --> 03:19:13.232]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[03:19:13.672 --> 03:19:14.893]  And we make it easy to do.
[03:19:15.293 --> 03:19:16.433]  We've got amazing products.
[03:19:16.473 --> 03:19:18.093]  We've got Cyber Week going right now.
[03:19:18.433 --> 03:19:20.354]  Extending our big mega sales for Black Friday.
[03:19:20.654 --> 03:19:21.534]  All supplies last.
[03:19:21.914 --> 03:19:24.215]  Water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements.
[03:19:25.035 --> 03:19:30.160]  T-shirts, books, films, it's all there, and it makes the information war possible against the globalists.
[03:19:30.180 --> 03:19:34.564]  So, I want to thank you this Christmas for your support, and I want to ask you for your continued support.
[03:19:34.944 --> 03:19:38.667]  It's a 360 win because these products are great, and these sales are the biggest ever.
[03:19:38.928 --> 03:19:43.612]  Free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off across the board, and double Patriot points.
[03:19:44.032 --> 03:19:47.375]  Right now, at InfoWarsTore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[03:19:49.377 --> 03:19:58.841]  But whatever you do, take action today, and spread the word, and spread the live info, or links, and articles, past the censors, because when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[03:20:06.205 --> 03:20:08.806]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.052 --> 03:20:21.285]  There's always room in life for the...
[03:20:53.692 --> 03:20:55.954]  All right, Roger Stone's hosting this hour with me.
[03:20:57.055 --> 03:20:59.977]  And obviously, he'll be hosting the war room coming up today.
[03:21:00.538 --> 03:21:07.083]  You couldn't have somebody more in the center of everything going on in this country than Roger Stone, other than Donald Trump, or Alex Jones, or Dr. Corsi.
[03:21:07.684 --> 03:21:11.187]  It's funny how it's just a very small group of people that they're honed in on, isn't it?
[03:21:11.947 --> 03:21:19.354]  Because they know who engineered, not with WikiLeaks, but with our own research, much of the blueprint to defeat Hillary.
[03:21:20.174 --> 03:21:21.676]  And that's really what a lot of this is, is
[03:21:22.850 --> 03:21:36.515]  I don't want to brag about this because I'm not into being a public figure, but the system knows we have this great grassroots populist come-from-behind win, and so we're heroes in the eyes of many of the people.
[03:21:37.396 --> 03:21:48.160]  So you've got to lie about us, say we're Russian agents, demonize us, say we stole the election when it's Hillary and the WikiLeaks rigging everything and fake polls and everything, rigging the debates.
[03:21:49.386 --> 03:21:50.267]  Calling for a race war.
[03:21:50.767 --> 03:21:51.848]  Someone's saying, I'm a hero.
[03:21:51.948 --> 03:21:57.172]  I'm saying to the folk out there, to the people, they don't want you to have a win.
[03:21:58.033 --> 03:22:03.657]  They don't want to say you had a win, because the American people are heroes for waking up and cutting through the brainwashing.
[03:22:04.678 --> 03:22:08.941]  And so then they turn into how we stole it, and we're nasty, and we're bad, and blah, blah, blah.
[03:22:08.961 --> 03:22:10.082]  But really, they're nasty and bad.
[03:22:10.102 --> 03:22:13.625]  Like Trump said, Bob Mueller is not a hero.
[03:22:13.665 --> 03:22:14.265]  He's a monster.
[03:22:14.285 --> 03:22:14.966]  And it's going to come out.
[03:22:15.006 --> 03:22:15.967]  The real heroes will come out.
[03:22:16.327 --> 03:22:17.408]  And that's the American people.
[03:22:18.678 --> 03:22:21.260]  You see how they had to change that narrative?
[03:22:21.840 --> 03:22:28.824]  They had to shut down our finances and take us off the web, so we couldn't respond when they said horrible things about us.
[03:22:28.844 --> 03:22:39.571]  We'll go back to Roger Stone in a moment, but I want to announce, a few weeks late, but I always do our contests, we'll be contacting the maker of this and having him on as a guest for a segment or so, but I wanted to get this done.
[03:22:40.671 --> 03:22:41.452]  How do you pronounce this?
[03:22:41.532 --> 03:22:44.394]  Carpe Donctum?
[03:22:45.354 --> 03:22:48.056]  Carpe D-O-N-K-T-U-M.
[03:22:50.405 --> 03:23:00.340]  And they made this piece, this NPC meme, that corresponds with Roddy Roddy Piper, and Roddy Roddy Piper was a big listener, he was on Before He Died.
[03:23:01.408 --> 03:23:02.989]  Another one of the great interviews that will leave it off YouTube.
[03:23:03.009 --> 03:23:04.130]  You can still find it somewhere, probably.
[03:23:05.372 --> 03:23:06.493]  And this is a little two-minute.
[03:23:06.513 --> 03:23:07.013]  This is the winner.
[03:23:07.313 --> 03:23:07.674]  One winner.
[03:23:07.694 --> 03:23:09.335]  A lot of images, a lot of videos.
[03:23:09.395 --> 03:23:10.656]  Could have been an image, could have been a video.
[03:23:11.037 --> 03:23:11.857]  But this is the winner.
[03:23:11.897 --> 03:23:16.181]  But you're all winners by getting politically involved, standing up, and taking action.
[03:23:16.622 --> 03:23:17.482]  So here is the winner.
[03:23:17.502 --> 03:23:18.563]  We'll get in contact with you.
[03:23:18.583 --> 03:23:20.205]  Shoot you a check for $10,000.
[03:23:20.946 --> 03:23:25.229]  But everybody that entered is a winner for standing up to the tyrants and not being an NPC.
[03:23:25.269 --> 03:23:25.610]  Here it is.
[03:23:30.560 --> 03:23:33.021]  I'll kind of do a radio-friendly deal.
[03:23:33.061 --> 03:23:34.562]  He puts the sunglasses on.
[03:23:35.182 --> 03:23:38.504]  He's the Antifa star on Hollywood Boulevard.
[03:23:38.524 --> 03:23:42.906]  When you were going to school, there were certain teachings.
[03:23:43.346 --> 03:23:45.287]  Fake news, dumpster fire, CNN.
[03:23:47.608 --> 03:23:48.748]  CNN is lies.
[03:23:49.929 --> 03:23:51.930]  CNN said there's no caravan.
[03:23:51.950 --> 03:23:52.850]  Remember that, two weeks ago?
[03:24:04.185 --> 03:24:05.285]  Party of love, Democrats.
[03:24:05.506 --> 03:24:06.166]  Change that matters.
[03:24:06.206 --> 03:24:07.906]  Put the glasses on.
[03:24:07.926 --> 03:24:08.647]  What's it turn into?
[03:24:10.607 --> 03:24:11.407]  Orange man bad.
[03:24:11.588 --> 03:24:12.448]  You have no ideas.
[03:24:13.188 --> 03:24:16.469]  Conform!
[03:24:16.569 --> 03:24:17.630]  Consume!
[03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:19.050]  Chop your testicles off.
[03:24:19.630 --> 03:24:20.631]  Roll over and die.
[03:24:22.711 --> 03:24:24.212]  Stay asleep.
[03:24:24.572 --> 03:24:24.912]  Obey.
[03:24:32.805 --> 03:24:35.026]  What's your problem?
[03:24:35.466 --> 03:24:38.688]  It's at TheInfoWars.com.
[03:24:38.768 --> 03:24:40.508]  Class is on.
[03:24:41.449 --> 03:24:42.749]  I said, what's your problem?
[03:25:02.625 --> 03:25:03.670]  Yeah.
[03:25:18.729 --> 03:25:23.631]  And again, most of it is really visual if you're a radio listener, but we're posting the winner to InfoWars.com.
[03:25:23.811 --> 03:25:26.373]  Another MPC in the wall.
[03:25:26.933 --> 03:25:29.894]  The same as the video on YouTube and other platforms, you want to get it and spread it.
[03:25:29.914 --> 03:25:32.455]  Another MPC in the wall.
[03:25:33.216 --> 03:25:35.297]  Two minutes, 20 seconds.
[03:25:36.377 --> 03:25:40.319]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:25:40.939 --> 03:25:42.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:44.281]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[03:25:48.251 --> 03:25:50.213]  You know, we got that six minute intro with Roddy Piper.
[03:25:50.233 --> 03:25:50.993]  Man, what a cool guy.
[03:25:51.013 --> 03:25:52.234]  All right, let's stop right there.
[03:25:53.616 --> 03:25:56.338]  Roger, you're going to take over here, but I just wanted to ask you this question.
[03:25:56.358 --> 03:26:01.222]  I know you're in the thick of this constantly, and they could indict you any minute, but you're like a superhero.
[03:26:01.242 --> 03:26:02.103]  They keep falling short.
[03:26:02.143 --> 03:26:05.065]  They had to get Manafort on some made-up tax stuff from 15 years ago.
[03:26:05.085 --> 03:26:10.130]  They had to go after Cohen for his taxi business, not paying taxes, and nothing to do with Trump.
[03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:12.592]  Then he rolled over like a dead fish in the sun.
[03:26:14.377 --> 03:26:18.899]  But moving on from that, Trump is signaling he's going after him and they're scared.
[03:26:19.499 --> 03:26:20.779]  Let's not get too confident.
[03:26:20.879 --> 03:26:22.280]  How are they going to counterstrike?
[03:26:24.821 --> 03:26:30.323]  Well, you know, it is still a concern of mine that Donald Trump Jr.
[03:26:30.543 --> 03:26:35.785]  may be the next one in the chute rather than Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or anyone else.
[03:26:36.965 --> 03:26:38.506]  And I think they're going to be desperate.
[03:26:39.139 --> 03:26:43.622]  To try to make something once again out of the Trump Tower meeting.
[03:26:44.102 --> 03:26:47.764]  What's amazing to me as this meeting that Donald Trump Jr.
[03:26:47.804 --> 03:26:58.430]  had with a Russian woman lawyer, it never gets included in the mainstream media that she met with representatives from Fusion GPS both before and after the meeting.
[03:26:58.770 --> 03:27:01.472]  I think that's called briefing and debriefing.
[03:27:02.612 --> 03:27:05.034]  Fusion GPS isn't really Russian.
[03:27:05.094 --> 03:27:09.376]  It's a Soros leftist cutout group that they didn't blame Russians with.
[03:27:10.296 --> 03:27:18.160]  Right, and that they could funnel money to from the DNC and through Hillary's campaign to formulate the phony Steele dossier.
[03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:24.723]  Man, what would you say... Little Birds told you about what else Fusion GPS... Well, you know what they've been up to.
[03:27:24.743 --> 03:27:26.324]  They're some naughty people, aren't they, Roger?
[03:27:27.104 --> 03:27:29.745]  No, they are some very bad people.
[03:27:31.777 --> 03:27:39.578]  It's amazing to me what an important part of shutting InfoWars down is to their overall strategy.
[03:27:40.399 --> 03:27:42.641]  I mean, we're not just blowing smoke here.
[03:27:43.241 --> 03:27:44.282]  We're the cutting edge.
[03:27:44.783 --> 03:27:46.564]  We're the Paul Revere of this story.
[03:27:46.584 --> 03:27:51.028]  No, it's like we woke up the Millennium Falcon in Episode 4 of Star Wars being chased by two Star Destroyers.
[03:27:51.088 --> 03:27:54.771]  I mean, it's like we really are the target because we know what's going on.
[03:27:55.131 --> 03:27:58.674]  And we just keep telling the listeners that because, folks, this isn't like other entertainment or other shows.
[03:27:59.135 --> 03:28:02.558]  This, the buzzards are circling us.
[03:28:04.228 --> 03:28:28.958]  And they know that InfoWars has the ability to mobilize millions of people to contact the White House, for example, through our WriteTrump.com program to urge him to direct his Justice Department to bring an antitrust action against Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter and so on to end the censorship, not just of InfoWars, but of all conservatives.
[03:28:29.538 --> 03:28:33.240]  All Libertarians, all Republicans, all Trump supporters.
[03:28:33.801 --> 03:28:42.346]  This is a vitally important program, and they know that we're the ones that rally the people to action, and that scares the daylights out of them.
[03:28:43.047 --> 03:28:51.112]  RideTrump.com, it's free, and next week we're going to do a bunch of them and mail them off to not just the White House, but other places the President goes to, like Mar-a-Lago, where he's about to go for Christmas.
[03:28:51.894 --> 03:28:55.075]  Make no mistake, Trump's not perfect, but he's the real deal and he represents this country.
[03:28:55.435 --> 03:28:56.316]  So does InfoWars.
[03:28:56.356 --> 03:28:56.916]  Please support us.
[03:28:56.936 --> 03:28:58.216]  We love you all and appreciate you.
[03:28:58.236 --> 03:28:59.777]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[03:29:02.858 --> 03:29:07.779]  What is the one event that made this whole thing news?
[03:29:08.200 --> 03:29:14.842]  When it's been going on for years and years and years and was never news, was never reported, what was it?
[03:29:16.118 --> 03:29:17.359]  That made it news now.
[03:29:18.359 --> 03:29:23.602]  Well, first and foremost was the desire for the media to make it a story.
[03:29:23.842 --> 03:29:27.524]  There is no reporting the news or discovering it.
[03:29:27.664 --> 03:29:28.725]  There is making the news.
[03:29:29.085 --> 03:29:31.567]  That's why I call this a manufactured crisis.
[03:29:32.207 --> 03:29:35.929]  And Boorstin's theory is that it usually happens with an image.
[03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:42.173]  A still photograph or a video that somebody in the media trots out
[03:29:43.280 --> 03:29:50.863]  And uses the image to begin shaping the emotional reaction of consumers of news.
[03:29:51.183 --> 03:29:56.145]  I could sit here all day and tell you about President Trump's new zero-tolerance immigration policy.
[03:29:56.165 --> 03:29:59.127]  The one that's leading to the separation of children from their parents at the border.
[03:29:59.187 --> 03:30:02.988]  And I could help you understand it by maybe quoting numbers or statistics.
[03:30:03.048 --> 03:30:05.049]  I could play sound bites of officials.
[03:30:05.809 --> 03:30:08.050]  Or I could just show you a single picture.
[03:30:08.531 --> 03:30:08.951]  This one.
[03:30:09.591 --> 03:30:18.718]  Of a screaming, terrifying two-year-old little girl wearing a tiny pink jacket, no laces in her shoes, stopped at the U.S.
[03:30:18.778 --> 03:30:19.779]  border with her mother.
[03:30:20.460 --> 03:30:27.625]  She is quickly becoming the human face of Trump's new immigration policy, one he says he hates, but is refusing to change.
[03:30:37.163 --> 03:30:39.005]  How soon do you think we'll be able to get this cut?
[03:30:39.405 --> 03:30:41.107]  Oh, we're gonna be done in about four or five hours.
[03:30:41.847 --> 03:30:42.968]  Oh, that's good.
[03:30:43.008 --> 03:30:43.909]  We can link that to the press.
[03:30:43.929 --> 03:30:46.431]  They can downlink it on Telstar 401, transporter 21.
[03:30:49.253 --> 03:30:52.416]  And this just in, a news break special report from the Albanian front.
[03:30:52.576 --> 03:31:00.042]  We've just received information that the young Albanian national fleeing in this video is attempting to escape terrorist reprisals in her village.
[03:31:05.994 --> 03:31:11.538]  America has seldom witnessed a more poignant picture of the human race than that which on... Fantastic.
[03:31:13.979 --> 03:31:17.041]  Thousands of people protested across Texas yesterday.
[03:31:17.081 --> 03:31:22.265]  They accused the administration of punishing undocumented children by removing them from their parents.
[03:31:22.705 --> 03:31:29.089]  Children and adults are seen huddled together in the building that's divided up into chain-link fencing that looks like a cage.
[03:31:29.129 --> 03:31:33.612]  Trump administration officials have been sending babies and other young children home.
[03:31:37.067 --> 03:31:40.690]  Mean-spirited and un-American.
[03:31:40.810 --> 03:31:43.953]  I can't do it, Wolf.
[03:31:44.013 --> 03:31:44.333]  I'm sorry.
[03:31:44.493 --> 03:31:46.355]  I can't do it.
[03:31:46.415 --> 03:31:46.755]  Yups.
[03:31:46.815 --> 03:31:50.158]  Put up the graphic of this.
[03:32:05.905 --> 03:32:08.167]  Thank you.
[03:32:08.227 --> 03:32:18.575]  But now the man who claims to be the little girl's father says she was in fact not separated from her mother.
[03:32:19.055 --> 03:32:21.317]  The Democrats want open borders.
[03:32:22.728 --> 03:32:25.509]  Tensions boiling over at the U.S.-Mexico border.
[03:32:25.549 --> 03:32:25.689]  U.S.
[03:32:25.809 --> 03:32:28.410]  agents shot tear gas into the crowd of migrants.
[03:32:28.450 --> 03:32:31.490]  That tear gas injured two children earlier today.
[03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:37.112]  Reuters photographers snapping these images, appearing to show a woman trying to rush two children to safety.
[03:32:37.152 --> 03:32:41.993]  There are those questioning the use of the tear gas on the women and children.
[03:32:42.233 --> 03:32:46.654]  What I find unconscionable is that people would intentionally take children into this situation.
[03:32:46.855 --> 03:32:48.415]  The caravan, as we call them,
[03:32:48.575 --> 03:32:53.398]  Would push women and children towards the front and then begin basically rocking our agency.
[03:32:53.879 --> 03:32:57.421]  Those are people coming to the border as far as you know for asylum, isn't it?
[03:32:57.962 --> 03:32:59.243]  I do not believe that is true.
[03:33:06.167 --> 03:33:08.869]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.781 --> 03:33:33.386]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:33.846 --> 03:33:36.748]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:41.031 --> 03:33:41.732]  Welcome back.
[03:33:42.352 --> 03:33:46.015]  I'm Roger Stone, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:47.156 --> 03:33:53.941]  Last night, I was privileged to join Laura Ingram on the Ingram Angle on Fox,
[03:33:54.842 --> 03:33:58.205]  And then, once again, joined her on her radio show this morning.
[03:33:58.725 --> 03:33:59.446]  Let's take a look.
[03:34:01.607 --> 03:34:07.352]  Earlier today, the Daily Caller reported of an early copy of a book written by author Jerome Corsi.
[03:34:07.812 --> 03:34:21.963]  Now, in this book, Corsi claims that he testified to Mueller's grand jury that just one month before the 2016 election, Trump confidant Roger Stone asked him to contact Julian Assange about releasing John Podesta's emails.
[03:34:23.644 --> 03:34:35.988]  Now, Corsi claims this was because Stone had advanced knowledge of the release of those infamous Access Hollywood tape, that knowledge that he knew about that, and advanced knowledge of the emails themselves.
[03:34:36.468 --> 03:34:40.789]  Corsi was asked about this earlier tonight on our own Tucker Carlson.
[03:34:41.857 --> 03:34:43.478]  This is a political winch-hut.
[03:34:44.419 --> 03:34:52.244]  Because I did not have a contact with Assange, but yet had figured out that Assange had Podesta's emails.
[03:34:52.264 --> 03:34:55.747]  And I figured it out and told Roger Stone and told many people in August.
[03:34:56.487 --> 03:34:58.468]  And it just happened that I was right.
[03:34:58.588 --> 03:35:00.770]  I did figure it out and I connect the dots.
[03:35:01.250 --> 03:35:02.611]  And this time I happened to be right.
[03:35:02.651 --> 03:35:04.432]  You just won't believe that I figured it out.
[03:35:05.871 --> 03:35:10.773]  Roger Stone is disputing some of Corsi's other claims, and he has a lot to say.
[03:35:10.853 --> 03:35:16.195]  He joins us now in an exclusive interview to tell us what is going on here.
[03:35:16.275 --> 03:35:17.955]  Roger, it's good to see you tonight.
[03:35:18.075 --> 03:35:23.057]  I know you watched what Mr. Corsi said on Tucker Carlson's show.
[03:35:23.077 --> 03:35:31.780]  A lot of folks watching, they think of the Mueller probe and nefarious Russian plots, and they hear Assange's name and the Ecuadorian embassy.
[03:35:31.820 --> 03:35:34.621]  They don't know who Jerome Corsi is, and they kind of know who you are.
[03:35:36.082 --> 03:35:44.211]  Simplify this for us so our listeners know what they need to know to understand the current state of affairs in this investigation, as it pertains to you.
[03:35:45.595 --> 03:35:54.138]  Well, first of all, Laura, thank you for having me because my own show at InfoWars is so heavily censored to deny me a forum to have a chance to defend myself.
[03:35:54.538 --> 03:35:56.258]  I'm very grateful for the chance to be here.
[03:35:57.259 --> 03:35:58.259]  This is really simple.
[03:35:59.179 --> 03:36:06.002]  It shows what happens when you hotbox a 72-year-old man for 40 hours, as the Mueller interrogators did.
[03:36:07.482 --> 03:36:16.106]  Quite clearly, I made it very clear that on August 21st, I posted a tweet that said, the Podesta's time in the barrel will come.
[03:36:16.707 --> 03:36:25.351]  I meant that public scrutiny of the Podesta's Russian business interests, as I had been briefed about by Jerry Corsi, would be in the media.
[03:36:25.951 --> 03:36:30.913]  Now Jerry Corsi has been browbeat into claiming that that was some kind of a cover story.
[03:36:31.673 --> 03:36:34.214]  And because I was taking heat for that tweet.
[03:36:34.594 --> 03:36:44.378]  But that's not even logical, Laura, because my tweet wasn't controversial until six weeks later when Julian Assange published John Podesta's email.
[03:36:44.438 --> 03:36:49.640]  So I had no advance notice that his emails would be stolen or that they would be published.
[03:36:50.020 --> 03:37:06.148]  And then the secondary claim that I knew about the Billy Bush NBC tape in advance and that I asked Jerry Corsi to contact Julian Assange to ask Assange to move up or move back his data dump to distract attention from that.
[03:37:06.528 --> 03:37:07.488]  That's a fairy tale.
[03:37:07.548 --> 03:37:09.189]  That's just whole cloth.
[03:37:09.569 --> 03:37:13.131]  I learned about it at 4 o'clock in the afternoon like every other American.
[03:37:13.391 --> 03:37:15.172]  I was actually on the street in Manhattan.
[03:37:15.772 --> 03:37:20.357]  It's sad that he's been pressured this way to bear false witness against you.
[03:37:20.377 --> 03:37:33.989]  There's no text evidence or email evidence regarding the Billy Bush claim and nothing definitive about the other claim about advanced knowledge.
[03:37:34.230 --> 03:37:38.954]  There's this one email from you to Corsi from July 4th.
[03:37:39.955 --> 03:37:40.616]  Twenty-fifth of 2016.
[03:37:40.716 --> 03:37:42.417]  We'll just put it up on the screen.
[03:37:43.498 --> 03:37:46.020]  Then this is from the draft court papers.
[03:37:46.821 --> 03:37:52.825]  Get to, I guess, Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and get the pending WikiLeaks emails.
[03:37:52.905 --> 03:37:55.688]  That's what you've referenced several times.
[03:37:55.928 --> 03:37:59.411]  And just, once again, why doesn't that look bad?
[03:38:00.677 --> 03:38:20.134]  Well there's an important back story because hours before that I was forwarded an email by James Rosen of Fox that had been sent to me by Charles Ortel, one of the very best researchers and investigators in the country, and Rosen had gotten a tip that the disclosures were going to be about the Clinton Foundation.
[03:38:20.575 --> 03:38:21.816]  Like every politico,
[03:38:22.136 --> 03:38:27.159]  Like every political reporter in America, I was curious about what Assange had.
[03:38:27.540 --> 03:38:29.441]  The bottom line of this law is very clear.
[03:38:29.881 --> 03:38:36.726]  Nothing we've learned in the last 72 hours shows that there was any collusion between the Russian state and Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:38:36.746 --> 03:38:44.391]  $20 million and two years in, there's still no evidence of any such Russian collusion.
[03:38:44.651 --> 03:38:46.354]  This is indeed a witch hunt.
[03:38:46.394 --> 03:38:54.688]  Roger, not according to David Sickling, who, and this is from today on CNN, who made a contrary claim.
[03:38:54.728 --> 03:38:55.148]  Let's watch.
[03:38:56.380 --> 03:39:10.425]  Well I think again this is more evidence of an ongoing conspiracy or collusion between high-ranking Trump campaign officials and Wikileaks and Julian Assange and the stolen emails.
[03:39:10.786 --> 03:39:21.450]  You can see that he's not only directing Jerome Corsi to get information about or get the copies of the emails or get information about them, he reports back to Roger Stone on August 2nd.
[03:39:23.220 --> 03:39:25.341]  Your response to him, some of it you've covered.
[03:39:25.361 --> 03:39:29.041]  When did political gossip become criminalized?
[03:39:30.222 --> 03:39:39.484]  Everybody in America wanted to know after Assange teased these emails on CNN in June and then on Fox in August what exactly it was that he had.
[03:39:39.924 --> 03:39:42.665]  But there is no flow of information.
[03:39:42.785 --> 03:39:48.006]  I received no emails and passed no emails on to Donald Trump or the Trump campaign.
[03:39:48.326 --> 03:39:50.066]  That's just a fairy tale.
[03:39:50.887 --> 03:39:52.147]  But let's face it.
[03:39:52.307 --> 03:40:06.978]  The entire Russian collusion delusion is meant to distract us from the fact that the Obama administration, the Obama NSA, the Obama FBI were using illegal, unconstitutional FISA warrants to spy on Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:40:07.278 --> 03:40:10.681]  And we're using the FBI to infiltrate Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:40:11.502 --> 03:40:20.829]  That, plus Uranium One, there's a great need to distract from all of those things, so we point to Donald Trump and the phony Russian collusion, which just doesn't exist.
[03:40:21.149 --> 03:40:24.191]  Have you been offered a deal by the special counsel?
[03:40:25.471 --> 03:40:26.632]  Most certainly not.
[03:40:26.792 --> 03:40:32.115]  And there's no circumstance whatsoever that I would bear false witness against the president.
[03:40:33.075 --> 03:40:40.439]  I am being persecuted because I supported Donald Trump for president and because I helped defeat Hillary Clinton and for no other reason.
[03:40:41.059 --> 03:40:43.040]  Roger Stone, thank you so much for joining us tonight.
[03:40:43.060 --> 03:40:44.041]  We really appreciate it.
[03:40:47.549 --> 03:40:49.130]  And there you have it.
[03:40:49.710 --> 03:40:53.353]  I couldn't do a better summary myself, although I guess I just did.
[03:40:54.353 --> 03:41:12.444]  It's extraordinary today the way the media has run with the four mischaracterized, or I guess it's three mischaracterized emails that are summarized but not produced in the, essentially, the bill of particulars against Dr. Jerry Corsi.
[03:41:13.184 --> 03:41:24.172]  Nothing in them, contrary to some public reports, shows that I had advance notice of the fact that John Podesta's emails had been stolen and would be published.
[03:41:24.653 --> 03:41:35.781]  There is an oblique reference from Jerry Corsi that it's time for the American people to learn more about the Podestas and that there are two dumps coming and the second one will be more devastating.
[03:41:36.201 --> 03:41:46.225]  But later, on October 3rd, Jerry Corsi not only sends me a text message, but also puts up a tweet saying, it's clear that Assange has nothing.
[03:41:46.565 --> 03:41:47.826]  He must have been bluffing.
[03:41:48.186 --> 03:41:49.386]  It's all BS.
[03:41:49.707 --> 03:41:55.389]  This was after Assange's October 3rd, 2nd, but 3rd in the United States.
[03:41:55.889 --> 03:41:56.610]  Press conference.
[03:41:56.990 --> 03:42:00.752]  So clearly, Jerry Corsi hadn't seen anything in advance.
[03:42:01.172 --> 03:42:10.478]  Additionally, I have text messages from Jerry Corsi when he actually read the WikiLeaks dumps in which he says, wow, there's a lot of information on the pedestrians here.
[03:42:10.838 --> 03:42:13.360]  So clearly, he had no advance notice.
[03:42:13.880 --> 03:42:15.341]  I had no advance notice.
[03:42:15.742 --> 03:42:17.783]  Alex Jones had no advance notice.
[03:42:18.303 --> 03:42:24.685]  This is part of the canard, as we call it, the Russian delusion fairy tale.
[03:42:25.205 --> 03:42:26.146]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:26.306 --> 03:42:27.766]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:27.806 --> 03:42:35.629]  When we come back, I want to talk about why I told The Spectator in Britain I thought it was possible that Donald Trump would not run again.
[03:42:36.289 --> 03:42:38.830]  They published that as a blazing headline.
[03:42:39.605 --> 03:42:45.331]  Implying perhaps that I thought he'd be run out of the presidency when that's not what I was saying at all.
[03:42:45.672 --> 03:42:51.198]  When we come back on the other side, we'll talk about 2020 and what the president's really gonna do.
[03:43:02.674 --> 03:43:04.816]  As you know, Mr. President, the caravan was not an invasion.
[03:43:04.896 --> 03:43:10.639]  It's a group of migrants moving up from Central America towards the border with the U.S.
[03:43:10.759 --> 03:43:12.140]  Thank you for telling me that.
[03:43:12.220 --> 03:43:13.181]  I appreciate it.
[03:43:13.321 --> 03:43:15.282]  Why did you characterize it as such?
[03:43:15.902 --> 03:43:18.204]  Because I consider it an invasion.
[03:43:18.244 --> 03:43:19.545]  You and I have a difference of opinion.
[03:43:19.605 --> 03:43:21.025]  But do you think that you demonized it?
[03:43:21.045 --> 03:43:24.588]  Jim Acosta told the President that the caravan didn't exist.
[03:43:25.968 --> 03:43:31.232]  And then, of course, they also said that it didn't exist when he pulled the microphone away and pushed the intern's arm down.
[03:43:32.159 --> 03:43:34.680]  But of course, the caravan does exist.
[03:43:35.261 --> 03:43:37.602]  There's more than 50,000 people still making their way up.
[03:43:38.022 --> 03:43:42.664]  More than 10,000 as of today are already massing on the border.
[03:43:43.185 --> 03:43:51.769]  And I have the camera crew and reporters there on the ground sending back incredible live feeds and also reports.
[03:43:52.809 --> 03:43:53.790]  But just think about that.
[03:43:54.542 --> 03:44:04.465]  Remember when the PR operative for Obama, Jonathan Gruber, bragged, thank God Americans are so stupid, thank God you have no attention span?
[03:44:04.865 --> 03:44:09.026]  You know, it's not just Jim Acosta that said that there is no caravan.
[03:44:09.306 --> 03:44:15.708]  At first they said, oh, the caravan's all women and children, they're all so sweet, and then they smash over the Guatemala border into Mexico, and okay, well,
[03:44:16.673 --> 03:44:17.573]  They deserve to be here.
[03:44:17.853 --> 03:44:19.474]  And then, oh, they're not violent.
[03:44:19.494 --> 03:44:20.934]  And then, oh, it doesn't exist.
[03:44:20.974 --> 03:44:21.574]  You're crazy.
[03:44:22.214 --> 03:44:23.815]  It's something Trump made up for the election.
[03:44:24.335 --> 03:44:32.177]  And now when Trump says, OK, we've beefed up security there, well, now he's a horrible, evil racist for not letting these people in.
[03:44:32.297 --> 03:44:34.837]  And less than 10% are women and children.
[03:44:35.458 --> 03:44:44.680]  And we catch the media cropping photos in a staged event with a woman with two kids with no shoes that just supposedly came up thousands of miles from Central and South America.
[03:44:45.656 --> 03:44:47.397]  And the lies go on and on from there.
[03:44:47.637 --> 03:44:52.840]  And that's why Infowars.com and Newswars.com existing is so critical.
[03:44:53.480 --> 03:45:03.925]  Because the only way for these insane lies to work, saying that there are more than two genders, saying that mother and father is bad, saying that world government doesn't exist while they're promoting it.
[03:45:04.385 --> 03:45:05.205]  All the things they're doing.
[03:45:05.926 --> 03:45:08.527]  Saying the surveillance state's a great thing, but also saying it doesn't exist.
[03:45:08.987 --> 03:45:09.768]  All this 1984 garbage.
[03:45:11.852 --> 03:45:28.694]  I can't stand being challenged at all, and that's why all over the world a reign of censorship is coming in, in a perfect storm of dying corporate media, big megacorporations, authoritarian regimes like Communist China, the EU, the Democratic Party and others working in concert to shut down.
[03:45:29.813 --> 03:45:39.116]  Loyal Americans and other loyal nationalists and just people that want free market and success and know that the American system, while not perfect, has been the best the world ever saw.
[03:45:39.497 --> 03:45:48.680]  And we don't want to adopt this crony capitalist model like Communist China has done, where the heads of the party are worth hundreds of billions of dollars and the general public starving to death.
[03:45:49.520 --> 03:45:51.402]  And it's praised by the left all over the world.
[03:45:51.482 --> 03:45:52.903]  This is sick.
[03:45:53.323 --> 03:45:55.926]  This is an attack on common sense, an attack on logic.
[03:45:56.406 --> 03:45:58.528]  And that's why InfoWars is more important than ever.
[03:45:59.208 --> 03:46:01.510]  We've got live feeds every day with our reporters.
[03:46:01.891 --> 03:46:04.093]  It's amazing at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:46:04.773 --> 03:46:12.962]  That's why it's so critical that this Christmas and this holiday season, all of you remember that without you supporting InfoWars financially, we will be shut down.
[03:46:13.382 --> 03:46:14.644]  And we make it easy to do.
[03:46:15.044 --> 03:46:16.185]  We've got amazing products.
[03:46:16.205 --> 03:46:23.973]  We've got Cyber Week going right now, extending our big mega sales for Black Friday, while supplies last, water filtration, air filtration, incredible supplements.
[03:46:24.774 --> 03:46:29.879]  T-shirts, books, films, it's all there, and it makes the information war possible against the globalists.
[03:46:29.919 --> 03:46:34.304]  So, I want to thank you this Christmas for your support, and I want to ask you for your continued support.

[03:47:05.545 --> 03:47:11.788]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:18.031]  My fellow Americans,
[03:47:18.937 --> 03:47:20.658]  Let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:21.318 --> 03:47:24.859]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:47:30.121 --> 03:47:31.881]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[03:47:32.822 --> 03:47:36.083]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:47:37.057 --> 03:47:48.864]  Yesterday, at the top of the Drudge Report, was a story from The Spectator in the UK, in which I said that I thought it was possible that Donald Trump would not run again in 2020.
[03:47:50.725 --> 03:47:54.327]  I was a little disappointed because the context was not clear.
[03:47:55.048 --> 03:48:05.454]  What I was saying was that if the president continues to turbocharge the economy in the next two years, as he has in the previous two years,
[03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:13.457]  If the president maintains our border security, repels the caravans, and builds a wall.
[03:48:14.312 --> 03:48:15.073]  If the president
[03:48:44.992 --> 03:49:06.825]  Once and for all set a course for extensive economic expansion that I think it would be incredibly possible for the president to not only say, I've made America great again, go down in history as one of our greatest presidents ever and ride off into the sunset.
[03:49:07.853 --> 03:49:16.498]  So I was not implying that he would be driven from the American presidency or that he wouldn't be able to attain re-election.
[03:49:16.978 --> 03:49:24.282]  But let's face it, the American presidency has cost Donald Trump over $2 billion of his own net worth.
[03:49:25.157 --> 03:49:32.360]  So unlike the Clintons and the Obamas and the Bushes, he hasn't made millions from the presidency.
[03:49:32.740 --> 03:49:37.883]  It's actually cost him hundreds of millions, in fact, billions of dollars.
[03:49:38.523 --> 03:49:49.908]  And then there's the personal wear and tear, because the president and his family are the subject of vicious personal attacks in the mainstream media every single day.
[03:49:50.825 --> 03:49:54.508]  No, I've been in American politics for 40 plus years.
[03:49:55.069 --> 03:49:59.072]  Donald Trump is the single toughest individual I've ever worked with.
[03:49:59.613 --> 03:50:01.915]  And I worked with former President Richard Nixon.
[03:50:02.576 --> 03:50:04.297]  I worked with Senator Bob Dole.
[03:50:04.918 --> 03:50:07.040]  I worked with some really tough customers.
[03:50:07.420 --> 03:50:16.248]  But Donald Trump is a man of uncommon courage, extraordinary energy, and he's extraordinarily stubborn.
[03:50:16.934 --> 03:50:18.955]  I don't mean that in a negative sense.
[03:50:19.075 --> 03:50:20.957]  I mean it in a positive sense.
[03:50:21.297 --> 03:50:28.721]  What I mean is, when he fixes on a goal, he will do whatever it takes to achieve that goal.
[03:50:29.102 --> 03:50:41.930]  When he seizes on an idea, for example, the idea of tax reduction and regulation reduction in order to recharge our economy, he will not be deterred by anyone.
[03:50:42.530 --> 03:50:51.663]  And now it appears to me that he has set his mind on progressing against those who are the real criminals.
[03:50:53.317 --> 03:50:57.781]  Wasn't it Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stone who said, every cop is a criminal?
[03:50:58.302 --> 03:51:00.184]  Well, that's certainly the case here.
[03:51:00.624 --> 03:51:09.092]  The people pressing the case for Russian collusion are the people who sold 20% of America's enriched uranium.
[03:51:09.452 --> 03:51:16.319]  That's the uranium used for creating weapons, not for creating heating fuel.
[03:51:17.781 --> 03:51:24.883]  To the Russian state are the very same people who are now accusing this president of Russian collusion.
[03:51:25.678 --> 03:51:38.382]  If Mr. Mueller wants to see Russian collusion, he should look in the mirror, since he is the one who schlepped the uranium samples to Stockholm for the Russians to inspect before they closed the deal.
[03:51:38.862 --> 03:51:40.542]  And then there's Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:51:40.922 --> 03:51:53.506]  They took $145 million from the Russian energy company while the fate of 20% of America's enriched uranium was on Hillary's desk for approval.
[03:51:54.231 --> 03:51:56.507]  No, I think it's all about to turn.
[03:51:57.872 --> 03:52:00.654]  And I think the president has had his fill.
[03:52:00.834 --> 03:52:21.264]  Now, as I said in the first segment, I believe it's entirely possible that because of the joint defense agreements between Jerry Corsi and the president and Donald Trump and the president, he's gotten a first-hand look at exactly how the special counsel operates and where they are headed.
[03:52:21.784 --> 03:52:25.246]  And this is probably the most important point I want to make today.
[03:52:26.081 --> 03:52:28.063]  This isn't about Roger Stone.
[03:52:28.463 --> 03:52:30.525]  It isn't about Jerry Corsi.
[03:52:30.805 --> 03:52:33.107]  It isn't about Paul Manafort.
[03:52:33.228 --> 03:52:35.209]  It isn't about Alex Jones.
[03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:36.911]  It isn't about any of us.
[03:52:37.391 --> 03:52:44.258]  It's about Donald Trump and undoing what they could not do at the ballot box, undoing the 2016 election.
[03:52:46.159 --> 03:52:54.703]  You see, the two-party duopoly, the neocons who have run this country into the ground, had 2016 all figured out.
[03:52:55.203 --> 03:52:58.144]  It was going to be Jeb Bush versus Hillary Clinton.
[03:52:58.684 --> 03:53:00.565]  Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[03:53:01.406 --> 03:53:02.106]  Or Tweedledummer.
[03:53:02.765 --> 03:53:31.683]  So, what we have here is the shock to this day over the improbable election of a man who believes in American supremacy, a man who believes in American sovereignty, a man who believes in American exceptionalism, a man who believes in America's strength and the free enterprise system, a man who believes in borders and not one world government, not globalist government.
[03:53:33.354 --> 03:53:38.017]  Now, the President, I think, is finally going to take the gloves off.
[03:53:38.478 --> 03:53:47.104]  Will it be the appointment of a special prosecutor to examine the crimes of the illegal and unconstitutional use of FISA warrants?
[03:53:47.684 --> 03:53:52.808]  Will it be the termination of Mr. Mueller and his witch hunt?
[03:53:53.448 --> 03:53:57.671]  I think the war drums grow louder.
[03:53:58.291 --> 03:54:03.435]  As one who has had to bear the brunt of this, I have to make a personal appeal.
[03:54:03.975 --> 03:54:17.584]  Yes, I had to set up a legal defense fund because, frankly, folks, the cost of defending myself against the onrushing thugs of Robert Mueller is costing me to the point of bankruptcy.
[03:54:18.044 --> 03:54:22.508]  Yes, it will destroy my family financially unless I get your help.
[03:54:22.888 --> 03:54:26.311]  I asked you to go to stonedefensefund.com.
[03:54:26.351 --> 03:54:28.853]  That's stonedefensefund.com.
[03:54:29.214 --> 03:54:31.155]  And send a contribution today.
[03:54:31.836 --> 03:54:37.241]  I have not only the investigations, witch hunt investigations of the U.S.
[03:54:37.281 --> 03:54:44.387]  Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees, I have a newly energized Adam Schiff in the House
[03:54:44.787 --> 03:54:45.828]  Intelligence Committee.
[03:55:15.548 --> 03:55:18.731]  Well, I'm not going to do that.
[03:55:19.071 --> 03:55:20.973]  But I need you to have my back.
[03:55:21.334 --> 03:55:22.255]  Here's the bottom line.
[03:55:22.755 --> 03:55:27.720]  Robert Mueller knows that he has to come through me to get to Donald Trump.
[03:55:28.020 --> 03:55:30.082]  And that's why they want me out of the picture.
[03:55:30.343 --> 03:55:34.667]  And it's why they want Infowars shut down, so that I have no platform.
[03:55:34.947 --> 03:55:36.990]  So Alex Jones has no platform.
[03:55:37.230 --> 03:55:39.193]  So David Knight has no platform.
[03:55:39.453 --> 03:55:41.596]  So Owen Schreier has no platform.
[03:55:41.937 --> 03:55:46.843]  So those who would defend the president and those who would bring you the truth have no voice.
[03:55:47.364 --> 03:55:50.468]  That's why now I want you to go to the Infowars.com site.
[03:55:50.829 --> 03:55:52.351]  This is vitally important.
[03:55:52.831 --> 03:55:57.555]  We have no multinational corporations who are underwriting what we do here.
[03:55:57.855 --> 03:56:00.517]  We have no big giant national sponsors.
[03:56:00.857 --> 03:56:02.839]  We can depend only on you.
[03:56:03.339 --> 03:56:05.541]  And it's Cyber Week.

[03:58:19.821 --> 03:58:21.622]  They want to sell them so they don't have inventory problems.
[03:58:21.822 --> 03:58:22.783]  They have to pay tax on that.
[03:58:22.843 --> 03:58:24.484]  So they're selling them to us at cost.
