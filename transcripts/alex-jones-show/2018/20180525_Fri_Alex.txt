[00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:24.727]  From the front lines.
[00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.531]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.932 --> 00:00:39.173]  What we are looking at is good and evil.
[00:00:39.193 --> 00:00:40.033]  Right and wrong.
[00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:41.694]  New World Order.
[00:00:50.492 --> 00:01:01.880]  As soon as they got rid of Schneiderman, this clearly protecting old Weinstein, the big, dirty house of cards began tumbling down.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.263]  We're going to navigate it all here today.
[00:01:05.283 --> 00:01:12.728]  But they're going to try to use men hitting on women in creepy ways, like Morgan Freedman does, to equate that with rape.
[00:01:13.588 --> 00:01:16.811]  And James Caan has popped in and made a great point on that.
[00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:17.651]  That's all coming up.
[00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:18.252]  But first,
[00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:28.291]  Raping women, raping men, that is only the tip of the fetid, stinking, Hollywood, devil worship iceberg.
[00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:34.567]  The satanism, the sex abuse, the abuse of children, the sacrifice of children.
[00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:37.590]  That's all coming out with record arrest of pedophiles.
[00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.679]  And now, families are fighting back, suing over MKUltra, including torture, including sexual torture of children, more than 20,000 of them.
[00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.281]  The dam is breaking.
[00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.462]  Leanne McAdoo reports.
[00:01:50.283 --> 00:02:05.413]  While some squabble about just who has ruined the reputation of intelligence agencies following revelations the deep state used a human informant to spy on the Trump campaign, others ask if agencies like the CIA ever had a good reputation in the first place.
[00:02:20.543 --> 00:02:35.977]  Over 40 Canadians who unknowingly became MKUltra patients at the Allen Memorial Institute, where MKUltra Subproject 68 took place, gathered in Montreal last weekend to share their horrific stories about how MKUltra destroyed their lives.
[00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:42.763]  As early as 1953, then CIA Director Alan Dulles authorized the MKUltra program.
[00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:55.349]  Julie Vanderpeer reports that Project MKUltra was a large-scale attempt by the CIA to research behavioral modification and the effects of certain drugs and psychological treatments on the human mind.
[00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:05.514]  It consisted of 144 different sub-projects related to the control of human behavior, which were carried out in 89 different institutions, including universities.
[00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:09.538]  Among its most notorious tests were those involving LSD.
[00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:19.329]  The agency hoped it would be some sort of a truth serum they could use to secretly manipulate and control foreign leaders or else make interrogation subjects speak more freely.
[00:03:20.811 --> 00:03:25.856]  A handful of Americans captured during the Korean War exhibiting behaviors of brainwashing.
[00:03:26.276 --> 00:03:29.199]  The CIA, too, wanted to understand mind control.
[00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:41.691]  So the project then spread into Canada, where a Scottish-born psychiatrist, Ewan Cameron, was trying to discover whether doctors could erase a person's mind and then reprogram new patterns of behavior.
[00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:59.598]  Patients initially entered the program at the Allen Memorial Institute seeking treatment for mild mental health issues like anxiety or depression, but were quickly administered cocktails of powerful hallucinogenic substances and subjected to bizarre psychological experiments under the supervision of Dr. Samuels.
[00:03:59.798 --> 00:04:04.044]  Who later became the first chairman of the World Psychiatric Association.
[00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:17.882]  The Guardian reports that MKUltra patients of Dr. Cameron's were subjected to high-voltage electroshock therapy several times a day, forced into drug-induced sleeps that could last months, and injected with megadoses of LSD.
[00:04:18.803 --> 00:04:32.206]  After reducing them to a child-like state, at times stripping them of basic skills such as how to dress themselves or tie their shoes, Cameron would attempt to reprogram them by bombarding them with recorded messages for up to 16 hours at a time.
[00:04:32.826 --> 00:04:42.008]  Montreal lawyer Alan Stein, who is representing the collective of MKUltra survivors of the Allen Memorial Institute, says he believes the survivors have a case.
[00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.370]  A CIA auditor's report from 1957 shows the agency wasn't concerned with protecting the patients,
[00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.656]  Instead, it sought to conceal the inhumane experimentation from the public.
[00:04:53.217 --> 00:05:02.650]  Concerning MKUltra, Esquire's Charles P. Pierce summed it up thusly, Americans are capable of terrible things, particularly if they're employed by the CIA.
[00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:11.118]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:18.962]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:22.524]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:05:23.144 --> 00:05:27.409]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.714]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:05:31.914 --> 00:05:34.637]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:39.362]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:05:39.842 --> 00:05:42.846]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:58.131]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.651]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:05:59.891 --> 00:06:02.372]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:07.534]  They think you're a goldfish!
[00:06:09.193 --> 00:06:11.274]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[00:06:11.554 --> 00:06:12.334]  I believe in you!
[00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:13.994]  I don't think you're stupid!
[00:06:14.074 --> 00:06:18.876]  One man, Everett's a woman!
[00:06:19.156 --> 00:06:20.776]  All genitals were cut off!
[00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:23.437]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[00:06:23.577 --> 00:06:24.777]  And we're not backing down on her!
[00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:27.838]  I want to get these people!
[00:06:27.898 --> 00:06:28.418]  We're winning!
[00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:29.579]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:30.199]  Can't you?
[00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.099]  We have broken their back!
[00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:33.640]  Yes, I can feel it!
[00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.001]  Let's go!
[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.840]  Come on!
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.181]  Come on!

[00:06:56.655 --> 00:06:56.895]  Come on!

[00:06:57.516 --> 00:06:57.716]  Come on!
[00:06:57.736 --> 00:06:57.996]  Come on!
[00:06:58.036 --> 00:06:58.537]  Come on!
[00:06:58.617 --> 00:06:59.017]  Come on!
[00:06:59.077 --> 00:06:59.338]  Come on!
[00:06:59.358 --> 00:06:59.778]  Come on!
[00:06:59.798 --> 00:07:00.138]  Come on!
[00:07:00.158 --> 00:07:00.539]  Come on!
[00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:00.939]  Come on!
[00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:01.279]  Come on!
[00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:01.460]  Come on!
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.680]  Come on!
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:01.900]  Come on!
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.140]  Come on!
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.320]  Come on!
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.621]  Come on!
[00:07:02.641 --> 00:07:02.921]  Come on!
[00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:03.181]  Come on!
[00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:03.381]  Come on!
[00:07:03.421 --> 00:07:03.681]  Come on!
[00:07:03.742 --> 00:07:04.142]  Come on!
[00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:04.442]  Come on!
[00:07:04.462 --> 00:07:04.923]  Come on!
[00:07:04.943 --> 00:07:05.323]  Come on!
[00:07:05.343 --> 00:07:05.583]  Come on!
[00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:06.004]  Come on!
[00:07:06.044 --> 00:07:06.504]  Come on
[00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:13.376]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[00:07:15.097 --> 00:07:21.402]  You think you're going to assassinate Trump, shoot down the independent media, and bully a bunch of us into going along with you?
[00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:24.224]  I'd like to reserve time.
[00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:24.364]  No.
[00:07:24.404 --> 00:07:33.910]  You're going to have to go on from being willing to have a fight, wanting one at this point, and only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW globalist George Soros droppings.
[00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.691]  Stabilize.
[00:07:34.731 --> 00:07:38.593]  The George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and the New World Order, and Michael Moore.
[00:07:38.673 --> 00:07:40.595]  Go back to Haiti, where you came from.
[00:07:41.907 --> 00:07:45.388]  We're awake, and you're not putting us back in the coma!
[00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:46.489]  You got that, Jack?
[00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:47.449]  You're done!
[00:07:47.469 --> 00:07:47.989]  It's over!
[00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.490]  We're alive!
[00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.950]  Get him back!
[00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.050]  Get him back!
[00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:58.733]  Do you think there was more than one of those guys?
[00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:01.934]  There's definitely another shooter involved.
[00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:02.235]  For sure.
[00:08:02.275 --> 00:08:02.955]  I'm picking shooter.
[00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:06.756]  It sounds like it's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully-automated weapons.
[00:08:07.076 --> 00:08:07.376]  Clear.
[00:08:07.657 --> 00:08:08.337]  What do you suggest?
[00:08:11.003 --> 00:08:13.886]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday, the 25th day of May 2018.
[00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:17.229]  I'm gonna be here for the next four hours.
[00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:31.443]  Then we've got the War Room coming up with Owen Schroyer, and he's gonna be joined by a co-host today for the full three hours, and that is Craig Sawyer, former Navy SEAL in the DEV Group.
[00:08:32.782 --> 00:08:37.265]  And a patriot, his buddy and teammate has got the Congressional Medal of Honor yesterday.
[00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:40.608]  So that'll be interesting to discuss on air.
[00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:41.809]  Might even get that fellow on.
[00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:53.478]  Owen Schroer and Craig Schroer, Schroer and Schroer are going to host the Veterans Call-In Show, A Voice for Our Veterans.
[00:08:53.498 --> 00:09:01.965]  They're going to take three hours of intense calls for veterans in active duty only going into Memorial Day weekend.
[00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:06.654]  And I have decided, because it's Memorial Day, I want to focus on veterans as well.
[00:09:06.674 --> 00:09:11.136]  So I'm going to come in and do the Sunday show live, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:19.599]  Most folks will be taking off, but I will be here this weekend because I want to focus on we're entering a post-human military.
[00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:29.542]  And that's going to sound good to a lot of people, but that's like the debate NASA had the last 20 years and said, oh, we don't want space exploration to be human.
[00:09:30.373 --> 00:09:32.976]  That's too dangerous, it's too costly, it's gonna be robots.
[00:09:34.317 --> 00:09:37.700]  We have to build a world for, of, and by humans.
[00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:41.144]  And then use robots and other things as an extension.
[00:09:41.804 --> 00:09:45.308]  But everything's being set up where it's a post-human future.
[00:09:46.489 --> 00:09:52.114]  That is the stated global compact of the Fortune 100.
[00:09:53.564 --> 00:09:55.625]  And that's what Elon Musk has warned you about.
[00:09:56.045 --> 00:09:57.646]  It's what Bill Joy has warned you about.
[00:09:58.107 --> 00:10:04.730]  It's what the Unabomber, who was in the MKUltra mind control program as a volunteer, Theodore Kaczynski has warned you about.
[00:10:05.651 --> 00:10:13.595]  And he thought just bomb technology heads and cause a revolution against technology because he thinks there's no way to adopt all this and survive.
[00:10:14.516 --> 00:10:15.957]  He's in a Supermax prison right now.
[00:10:18.198 --> 00:10:19.739]  And the reason I mentioned MKUltra
[00:10:21.608 --> 00:10:23.289]  There's a lot of lawsuits that have been filed.
[00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:25.530]  In fact, I meant to get to that on like Tuesday and I didn't.
[00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.030]  Can you guys pull me that out of the stack?
[00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:40.714]  And also yesterday's stack I wanted to get into of the declassification of the CIA running the media in the 60s and ordering them to use the term conspiracy theory to criticize anyone exposing the planetary plan.
[00:10:40.754 --> 00:10:43.275]  So I thought we should show all this for people.
[00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:48.357]  It's all coming out right now and a lot of it's because Trump is in office.
[00:10:49.687 --> 00:11:10.742]  But make no mistake, when you hear about Weinstein being indicted for multiple felony counts of rape and sexual abuse, torture basically, that's all because of the American people standing up to the media, to Hollywood, to the bullies, and getting Donald John Trump elected.
[00:11:12.023 --> 00:11:17.607]  Now I told you, from CIA, MI6, Army,
[00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:29.184]  Navy, Marine Corps sources, many of which have been on the show by name, that Trump's, one of his main planks was going after sex trafficking.
[00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:45.989]  And not just the Garden Variety, but the Harvey Weinstein on the plane of the Lolita Express owner, who has been convicted of trafficking young girls to his slave island.
[00:11:47.432 --> 00:11:51.457]  That Obama went to, that Bill Clinton went to, that they all go to.
[00:11:51.477 --> 00:12:02.110]  And now Richard Branson's private island had the NXIVM sex cult women, an entire group of hundreds of them on it, to quote, try to get him to join the cult.
[00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:05.935]  I'm just telling you that's what's going on on these islands, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:13.406]  I've talked to people in Hollywood that haven't given me details years ago, but that's how I'm on record saying they torture women.
[00:12:14.607 --> 00:12:24.975]  They're on record putting them through mind control because I've been told that by famous actresses and famous actors in Hollywood that they're running mind control operations.
[00:12:25.975 --> 00:12:33.841]  And that it's a branch of the CIA, but really the Aleister Crowley cult through Jack Parsons and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
[00:12:35.216 --> 00:12:37.877]  He taught Hollywood all this in the 50s and 60s and set it up.
[00:12:38.117 --> 00:12:40.597]  And that's in mainline history.
[00:12:40.657 --> 00:12:42.398]  That's in major newspapers.
[00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:45.438]  So, Katie bar the door.
[00:12:45.618 --> 00:12:57.461]  You need to understand, this Weinstein thing, he reportedly, according to his driver and his longtime assistant, raped dozens of women in front of them.
[00:12:59.141 --> 00:13:03.484]  He liked about 95 pound women that looked like they were 15.
[00:13:03.544 --> 00:13:04.265]  They'd be 16, 17, 18.
[00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:08.408]  He'd pin them in the limo and rape them.
[00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.814]  And I'm not going to go into the rest of the stuff that's even been documented, but it's exactly what these guys like.
[00:13:15.874 --> 00:13:17.135]  It's a beautiful young woman.
[00:13:21.077 --> 00:13:22.198]  I'm not even going to say it.
[00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.620]  They like to humiliate women.
[00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:26.722]  Just like they like to hurt children.
[00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:30.553]  Now, Weinstein has not been implicated from any of my sources.
[00:13:31.174 --> 00:13:32.996]  There's underage stuff going on, which is bad enough.
[00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:37.019]  But the pedophilia has not popped up on my intel radar with him.
[00:13:37.339 --> 00:13:39.481]  But with a lot of the other folks, that's the case.
[00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:42.284]  So he's been smirking outside going in.
[00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:46.027]  He wasn't smirking once he was in handcuffs getting marched out of there.
[00:13:47.628 --> 00:13:48.569]  So that's all coming up.
[00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:49.930]  But I told you this was happening.
[00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.974]  There's like an eight-fold arrest of child traffickers, pedophiles.
[00:13:55.299 --> 00:13:57.225]  We're not talking about people that just have some child porn.
[00:13:57.466 --> 00:13:59.011]  We're talking about the producers of it.
[00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.913]  And it's happening all over the country, and that's why the Democrats are so rattled.
[00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:13.319]  Because their extortion system is based on this, and Trump knows all about it from, who did I tell you, back in November last year?
[00:14:13.779 --> 00:14:16.601]  Five days before the election, two days before he went public in Breitbart?
[00:14:17.102 --> 00:14:24.587]  I was told by high-level people in the CIA and Pentagon that Eric Prince was quarterbacking this move with Trump to bring down the pedophiles.
[00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:28.110]  Now, I didn't know that was true from my sources, though they've been really accurate.
[00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.231]  Three, four days later, he's in Breitbart saying, yes, it's true.
[00:14:32.512 --> 00:14:34.152]  So, credit goes where credit's due.
[00:14:34.652 --> 00:14:35.253]  Eric Prince.
[00:14:36.473 --> 00:14:42.795]  Yes, the former founder of Blackwater, that the left demonizes and says is this horrible person all day.
[00:14:42.835 --> 00:14:43.436]  Why is that?
[00:14:43.836 --> 00:14:44.676]  Why is that the case?
[00:14:45.196 --> 00:14:48.698]  Why did Blackwater get blamed for all this stuff that other mercenary groups did?
[00:14:49.518 --> 00:14:50.538]  Because now I know.
[00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:52.399]  Now I understand the bigger picture.
[00:14:54.574 --> 00:14:56.996]  So, that's what's really happening here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:57.796 --> 00:15:01.019]  And so, just, you heard it here first, and it's all been confirmed.
[00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:03.040]  So, there you go.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:14.328]  So thanks to Eric Prince, thanks to all our other sources, and we are so close right now to this whole house of cards coming down, and if you bring down Weinstein, it blows the door open on all of it.
[00:15:14.348 --> 00:15:21.754]  So they're trying to red herring and smokescreen as hard as they can with, oh, Morgan Freedman hit on women on the set.
[00:15:22.834 --> 00:15:23.415]  Oh, uh,
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.301]  You know, another Hollywood guy hugged a girl too hard.
[00:15:28.862 --> 00:15:32.883]  Or Prairie Day Companion, the woman hugged him and her shirt went up and he touched her back.
[00:15:33.763 --> 00:15:34.363]  Oh my gosh.
[00:15:35.024 --> 00:15:36.864]  That's not torturing little kids.
[00:15:37.184 --> 00:15:38.385]  That's not raping women.
[00:15:38.585 --> 00:15:40.846]  And don't compare the two to it!
[00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:43.207]  And I'm not defending Morgan Freedman.
[00:15:43.227 --> 00:15:44.227]  He's a total sellout.
[00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.508]  Did those stupid arrests, you know, Trump.
[00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:52.289]  TV pieces he did with that idiot Rob Reiner, Meathead, who says we're in a civil war.
[00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:54.411]  Yeah, we are in one and you're getting your butt kicked.
[00:15:54.671 --> 00:15:55.972]  So keep censoring, keep pushing.
[00:15:56.213 --> 00:15:57.674]  We're bringing you down right now.
[00:15:58.155 --> 00:16:00.337]  The transmission goes into overdrive straight ahead.

[00:19:06.884 --> 00:19:08.185]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[00:19:08.225 --> 00:19:09.926]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:19:10.186 --> 00:19:12.588]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:19:12.628 --> 00:19:13.549]  We've beaten six.
[00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:15.751]  But understand this, I am your soldier.

[00:20:06.386 --> 00:20:10.950]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.593 --> 00:20:18.696]  There's a need for a new world order.
[00:20:19.797 --> 00:20:25.902]  But it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[00:20:27.323 --> 00:20:33.588]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.051 --> 00:20:38.432]  Well, North Korea has blown up their nuclear site a few days ago.
[00:20:38.452 --> 00:20:39.553]  They've released the video.
[00:20:39.793 --> 00:20:42.494]  That is a big victory for America and Trump.
[00:20:43.134 --> 00:20:50.397]  Even if the summit's been cancelled for now, that's just part of the negotiation process due to John Bolton and others trying to sabotage things.
[00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:54.319]  But we'll continue to track that and play that video coming up in the next segment.
[00:20:55.796 --> 00:21:12.467]  We're also going to continue to track what's happening in the economy and with these new privacy rules that Europe has put in place that are not really actually designed to protect your privacy because they're going to continue mass spying and all the rest of it and big data.
[00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:22.894]  It's designed to basically have an internet war and try to take regulatory control of the internet over from the United States and transfer it to Europe and the UN.
[00:21:23.835 --> 00:21:26.238]  And George Soros and others are a big supporter of it.
[00:21:26.698 --> 00:21:32.806]  Facebook and Google hit with $8.8 billion in lawsuits on day one of GDPR.
[00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:36.160]  And boy, we've been preparing for months for this.
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.481]  We already had a lot of the opt-out systems for folks.
[00:21:38.801 --> 00:21:42.782]  But the way the Internet's been designed is all of this tracking.
[00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:47.464]  I mean, that's how, when you have an account, say, on Disqus, or Disqus, to be able to post.
[00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:50.685]  I mean, it knows what you did in the past, how you've operated, because it has cookies.
[00:21:51.065 --> 00:21:51.986]  It's the very nature of it.
[00:21:52.546 --> 00:22:02.270]  The issue is that it's all being tied together with larger databases by governments and megacorporations to then track everything you're doing in Communist China.
[00:22:03.297 --> 00:22:08.120]  Has come out, and here's the big secret that the EU's not talking about.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.761]  It's not a secret what China's doing.
[00:22:10.081 --> 00:22:20.968]  China's got their big social score that ties systems way beyond what Google and Facebook are doing together with the real world with live time cameras via a company called Skynet.
[00:22:22.216 --> 00:22:32.220]  To track what you do in live time and then ban you from traveling, getting a job, being able to buy food, if you're not a good servant of the Communist Party.
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:42.664]  Are we hearing any lawsuits from the EU and from Juncker, the unelected dictator of the EU?
[00:22:44.326 --> 00:22:45.387]  The permanent bureaucracy.
[00:22:45.847 --> 00:22:49.951]  Are we hearing anything from them?
[00:22:50.492 --> 00:22:53.575]  See, that's how information warfare really works.
[00:22:53.715 --> 00:22:55.497]  That's why this broadcast is hated.
[00:22:55.817 --> 00:23:05.786]  Because we enter new, devastating paradigm interpretations that no one else is engaged in.
[00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:08.209]  Because I started thinking about this a few weeks ago.
[00:23:09.775 --> 00:23:15.056]  And I looked into it, and we have not seen the EU do anything to China.
[00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:18.397]  Because remember, the Internet's all tied together in a global system.
[00:23:19.037 --> 00:23:31.360]  So they're trying to put forward the most draconian regulations in the name of peace and security and free speech and privacy and protecting your identity, and they immediately attack the United States.
[00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:56.929]  And there's nothing about China, and then I search engined it, and no one has pointed out yet that China is being left alone, even though China and its websites, Alibaba and millions and millions of others, are operating in levels of data mining and scraping and identity theft that boggles the brain.
[00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:01.828]  They have a Mark of the Beast global social credit.
[00:24:02.228 --> 00:24:17.715]  Apple has moved there and given the state the keys to the kingdom of your Apple ID to be able to access that entire system of the entire Apple world of what you've done.
[00:24:21.757 --> 00:24:24.918]  Oh, Apple doesn't let you opt out of that, do they?
[00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:26.959]  See?
[00:24:29.128 --> 00:24:51.159]  Oh, so Communist China can do whatever they want, because, oh, because the Chinese dictator, he's now officially been made a dictator, he was already appointed by the Communist Party that would vote for him, but then the Communist Party would decide who could, quote, run via the Central Committee, but now he's just president for life and his vice president was made vice president for life.
[00:24:51.179 --> 00:24:57.863]  He's officially a dyed-in-the-wool dictator, meaning he dictates.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.481]  And he's got control of most of the internet.
[00:25:04.561 --> 00:25:06.683]  China is winning the war for the web.
[00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:14.327]  And I've talked to the Cyber Command people, I've talked to the NSA people here at UT, I've talked to them all, and they're like, no, you're right.
[00:25:14.727 --> 00:25:20.030]  And all Trump's doing is trying to desperately do something so he's told the Chinese you can't officially run UT.
[00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.151]  That was in the Washington Post.
[00:25:25.632 --> 00:25:26.212]  It's unbelievable.
[00:25:26.232 --> 00:25:26.952]  Yeah, there's CNN.
[00:25:27.032 --> 00:25:29.553]  Apple under fire for moving iCloud data to China.
[00:25:29.893 --> 00:25:30.873]  I was the first person.
[00:25:30.893 --> 00:25:33.014]  I'm not even bragging to freak out about this.
[00:25:33.414 --> 00:25:39.115]  The original Reuters article was just China's moving to... Apple's moving to China.
[00:25:40.775 --> 00:25:44.496]  And then I read further and I'm like, they're gonna move the cloud data there?
[00:25:44.536 --> 00:25:46.276]  That means the code keys.
[00:25:46.537 --> 00:25:48.397]  I'm not even an engineer and I know that.
[00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:53.131]  And then of course a week later.
[00:25:53.792 --> 00:26:01.339]  That's what scares me is that I continue, nine times out of ten, to be the first person that actually even understands what's happening here.
[00:26:04.142 --> 00:26:05.003]  At least publicly.
[00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:12.351]  There are tons of people in tech and in government that know all this too, but they just, no one writes about it.
[00:26:13.462 --> 00:26:17.906]  I remember learning in Hollywood six, seven years ago that China controlled all six of the big studios.
[00:26:18.166 --> 00:26:22.811]  I talked about it on air, and man, all the white supremacists flipped out because they're obsessed with Jews.
[00:26:23.291 --> 00:26:25.954]  And they went, Jones says China runs Hollywood.
[00:26:25.994 --> 00:26:26.915]  How ridiculous.
[00:26:27.295 --> 00:26:28.376]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:31.199]  I'm talking about who came in and bought control of it.
[00:26:32.813 --> 00:26:44.020]  I'm not saying there aren't a bunch of people who are Jewish and Italian and whatever in Hollywood that are directors and producers, but the Communist Chinese own Hollywood now!
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.841]  That's been all over the news!
[00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:54.686]  And so I'm watching China take over, and I mean the Communist Party of China, and I'm watching them take control of the whole world.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:26:59.721]  And then, oh my gosh, U.S.
[00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:06.608]  companies get hit with billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars.
[00:27:08.469 --> 00:27:14.535]  And it's all to set the precedent with Americans that, oh, at least they're going after the big tech guys that are bad who deserve it, which they kind of do.
[00:27:16.513 --> 00:27:18.875]  But the next is going to be all the small sites you watch.
[00:27:18.895 --> 00:27:19.656]  They've already announced it.
[00:27:19.956 --> 00:27:32.268]  They're coming after the internet in America, using the EU, all draconianly implemented, and China is exempt because the Chinese dictator, he went to Davos 15 months ago, last year.
[00:27:33.669 --> 00:27:38.653]  And he said, I will hold the New World Order up, I will hold the Euro up, we will defeat Trump.
[00:27:38.933 --> 00:27:46.739]  And Juncker shook his hand and said, quote, we're going to have a trade war with America and we're going to remove Trump and we're going to defeat America.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:53.585]  That was in the foreign news, a hereditary grandson of the most powerful Nazi family in Germany.
[00:27:54.025 --> 00:27:56.687]  The Junkers, the damn bombers were called Junkers.
[00:27:58.148 --> 00:27:59.910]  The munitions factories, everything.
[00:28:02.091 --> 00:28:02.572]  Junker!
[00:28:04.994 --> 00:28:07.015]  He told us, I'm going to defeat you!
[00:28:07.035 --> 00:28:24.366]  And Hollywood, and the Communist Chinese, and the Islamicists, and the EU, and the chi-coms are all against us, and the average leftist doesn't even know it, doesn't even care, and thinks I'm the enemy when all we're trying to do with Trump is save something, you idiots!
[00:28:25.467 --> 00:28:27.048]  We've been completely overrun!
[00:28:27.588 --> 00:28:29.850]  We have been completely sold out, you fools!
[00:28:34.892 --> 00:28:35.933]  You got S.O.B.
[00:28:35.973 --> 00:28:38.295]  Nazis telling us that they're gonna defeat us.
[00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:50.103]  Well, just like you were arrogant before, you're gonna get your ass handed to you, younker, and your Chinese communist dictator, and that Nazi collaborator Soros, you are all gonna pay!
[00:28:50.283 --> 00:28:51.184]  They're gonna get beat!
[00:28:51.464 --> 00:28:53.106]  America will defeat you!
[00:28:53.766 --> 00:28:55.227]  Russia will defeat you!
[00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:57.369]  You're gonna get your asses kicked politically!
[00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:58.790]  We know what's going on now!
[00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.554]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.
[00:29:08.676 --> 00:29:23.713]  We are launching our biggest recruitment and hiring operation ever in our 23-year history as we prepare to go 24 hours a day live on TV and radio from the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas.

[00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:31.652]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others.
[00:30:32.093 --> 00:30:36.034]  They weren't even contest winners, but they were runner-uppers.
[00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:53.863]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.

[00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:34.070]  We are not victims.
[00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.491]  We are victorious.
[00:31:35.851 --> 00:31:40.795]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[00:31:40.875 --> 00:31:45.539]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color, and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.

[00:32:04.529 --> 00:32:13.438]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[00:32:13.959 --> 00:32:24.970]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.

[00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:09.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.358 --> 00:33:15.739]  You are the one they call President?
[00:33:15.959 --> 00:33:16.199]  I am.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:17.100]  Neat.
[00:33:34.238 --> 00:33:35.098]  You are not the president.
[00:33:36.118 --> 00:33:40.059]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so comfortably.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.562]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:49.982 --> 00:33:51.562]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:57.684]  Have you noticed that there's all this
[00:33:58.558 --> 00:34:13.383]  There's yelling and screaming and squawking and there's black leaders I've seen on CNN, MSNBC saying the founding fathers gave us the right to free speech, which they didn't.
[00:34:13.403 --> 00:34:14.863]  They just pointed out a right that already existed.
[00:34:15.924 --> 00:34:20.305]  And the NFL players, they have a right to kneel.
[00:34:21.186 --> 00:34:24.767]  How dare the NFL say they've got to stay in the locker room.
[00:34:25.779 --> 00:34:27.140]  They've got to stay in the field house.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.461]  They've got to stay in the dugout.
[00:34:29.461 --> 00:34:32.803]  They've got to stay in their barracks.
[00:34:33.543 --> 00:34:36.805]  And they can come out later if they don't want to stand for the National Anthem.
[00:34:37.486 --> 00:34:45.530]  Well, number one, they signed a contract that says that, and the contract says they're entertainers, and the ticket says it's entertainment.
[00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:50.433]  It's actually a blood sport, but that's entertainment too.
[00:34:51.233 --> 00:34:52.214]  They're modern gladiators.
[00:34:53.703 --> 00:34:56.546]  Some of the NFL acting like they don't know that it causes brain damage.
[00:34:56.566 --> 00:34:58.648]  The average NFLer dies at age 54.
[00:34:59.028 --> 00:35:03.252]  Yeah, I'd say that's gladiators.
[00:35:05.634 --> 00:35:11.560]  But the NFL gets all political, loses about 45% of their viewers in the last three years.
[00:35:13.137 --> 00:35:17.278]  So now they're in panic mode, just like Hollywood lost 30-40% of its revenue.
[00:35:17.918 --> 00:35:18.818]  Same thing across the board.
[00:35:18.878 --> 00:35:20.098]  People are sick of it.
[00:35:20.498 --> 00:35:22.279]  They're sick of the virtue signaling.
[00:35:22.299 --> 00:35:26.619]  They're sick of the political messaging, the anti-American, anti-family garbage.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.380]  I don't care what Netflix show it is I try to watch.
[00:35:33.161 --> 00:35:34.981]  Or Deadpool 2, you name it.
[00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:39.902]  It is just hammering you with anti-family, anti-American garbage.
[00:35:42.403 --> 00:35:46.545]  And so they've been dropping 15, 20 points, depending on which poll you look at, the last three years running.
[00:35:46.765 --> 00:35:50.007]  Some numbers have them down 57%, 60%, but it's about 45%.
[00:35:50.868 --> 00:35:54.490]  That is devastating to them.
[00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.370]  Okay?
[00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.433]  So the Hollywood crew and the propagandists, they kind of tell everybody which direction to go.
[00:36:01.934 --> 00:36:03.375]  And then the NFL gets on board.
[00:36:05.616 --> 00:36:10.519]  And Jerry Jones was the first, once he tried that kneeling thing, and it blew up in his face to say, we got to stop this.
[00:36:12.056 --> 00:36:13.217]  But just think of the hypocrisy.
[00:36:13.637 --> 00:36:16.179]  Yes, they can go kneel outside of the stadium.
[00:36:16.659 --> 00:36:18.721]  They can go kneel on TV interviews.
[00:36:18.961 --> 00:36:20.802]  They can go call a press conference and kneel all day.
[00:36:22.503 --> 00:36:36.373]  But if part of, say, working at InfoWars as the company is that you've got to stand during the company song, that's part of working there.
[00:36:36.393 --> 00:36:37.494]  We don't have a company song.
[00:36:37.534 --> 00:36:38.154]  We don't do that.
[00:36:38.374 --> 00:36:40.656]  But there are some companies that actually have that.
[00:36:42.329 --> 00:36:47.853]  There are some companies that say you've got to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, or you've got to stand for the Marine Corps Battle Hymn.
[00:36:48.253 --> 00:36:57.520]  Whatever it is, you work at that company, as long as it's not bizarre, illegal, whatever, you have to follow what the company's doing.
[00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:01.543]  So the poor babies are paid, what, on average about $8 million a year.
[00:37:02.164 --> 00:37:11.691]  They want a grandstand with that moron, Kaepernick, who sued the NFL because they cut him later because he sucked.
[00:37:12.657 --> 00:37:18.680]  He became so political, he wasn't doing well, he was throwing all these interceptions, and then he got cut.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.761]  First he got benched, then he got cut.
[00:37:21.821 --> 00:37:22.662]  And then he sued!
[00:37:22.682 --> 00:37:27.024]  I've only made $80 million dollars, or was it $89 million he'd been paid already?
[00:37:27.044 --> 00:37:31.266]  I only got $89 million!
[00:37:31.586 --> 00:37:34.047]  The racist white people are hurting me!
[00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:38.429]  So there you go.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.723]  And the reason I'm digressing off into this is, it's total and complete hypocrisy.
[00:37:45.924 --> 00:37:56.712]  When you've got Google and Twitter and Facebook and YouTube engaged in massive, complete, total censorship of conservatives, libertarians, veterans groups, Christians, pro-gun groups, you name it.
[00:37:56.952 --> 00:37:58.733]  Anybody right of Hillary Clinton.
[00:38:01.795 --> 00:38:03.737]  They testify before Congress they're doing it.
[00:38:05.458 --> 00:38:08.340]  Then Zuckerberg goes before the EU Parliament and denies he's doing it.
[00:38:09.485 --> 00:38:10.046]  It's incredible.
[00:38:11.887 --> 00:38:18.413]  When he was caught on a hot mic a few years ago telling Merkel he would censor everybody that criticized open borders and the Islamic invasion.
[00:38:18.613 --> 00:38:19.234]  And he did that.
[00:38:19.534 --> 00:38:20.896]  He called the police on them.
[00:38:21.636 --> 00:38:28.723]  They hired former Stasi people at Facebook four years ago to call the police on people that criticize Islam.
[00:38:32.787 --> 00:38:35.269]  So isn't that the chickens coming home to roost?
[00:38:39.451 --> 00:38:53.814]  And the left, aren't even the left, they're a bunch of authoritarian corporatists, like the Nazis have their ideology, they have their trendy ideology, and they don't even understand the larger game they're playing, and then now the EU just came in.
[00:38:55.934 --> 00:39:02.676]  After Zuckerberg and Google and everybody went along with their censorship and helped them, they're now allied with Communist China and their dictator.
[00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:12.215]  And China isn't being hit with any GDPR, because China won't put up with it, China won't pay it, China doesn't have 20 million lawyers.
[00:39:14.156 --> 00:39:15.216]  They're a dictatorship.
[00:39:16.797 --> 00:39:26.663]  No, it's only going to be the EU coming after US companies, hiding behind the fact that they're doing it for people's privacy, when that's complete balderdash.
[00:39:27.523 --> 00:39:32.106]  They spy on their entire population EU-wide, probably worse than the United States.
[00:39:33.697 --> 00:39:38.161]  And they're allied with the Chinese Communist dictator.
[00:39:39.362 --> 00:39:43.745]  And we are in a two-way trade war with China and the EU.
[00:39:43.785 --> 00:39:45.166]  They are teamed up against us.
[00:39:45.547 --> 00:39:47.008]  Even CNBC says that!
[00:39:47.028 --> 00:39:52.612]  So I'm going to say it again very slowly to the listeners that are establishment or that are new.
[00:39:55.455 --> 00:39:59.438]  You can be delusional if you want and think I'm wrong about any of this.
[00:40:03.254 --> 00:40:09.818]  But the crook search engines, two people back there in live time, everything I say, and they're just pulling it up in live time.
[00:40:11.379 --> 00:40:22.346]  I told you last segment the EU and China are in a trade war with us, to destroy us, and that it's criminal because it's under the even WTO rules you can't do that.
[00:40:22.566 --> 00:40:25.708]  You can't exempt China and others and then only attack us.
[00:40:26.008 --> 00:40:26.949]  That's what Trump's upset about.
[00:40:27.149 --> 00:40:29.631]  And the left is cheerleading against
[00:40:30.879 --> 00:40:31.360]  America.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.202]  And it's disgusting.
[00:40:33.702 --> 00:40:34.523]  And it's dangerous.
[00:40:34.824 --> 00:40:35.424]  And it's bad.
[00:40:35.704 --> 00:40:45.676]  And then meanwhile, we've got NFL players making $8 million a year on average, griping and complaining that their speech has been taken when their speech has not been taken.
[00:40:48.098 --> 00:40:51.022]  I can use cuss words all day at night if I want to at home.
[00:40:51.837 --> 00:40:58.350]  But if I work at a company, and they have a policy against profanity, and I go around the office cussing like a sailor, they can fire me!
[00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.813]  Is that violating my free speech?
[00:41:00.214 --> 00:41:01.175]  No, it's not!
[00:41:07.642 --> 00:41:11.504]  All over the country, valedictorians, salutatorians are being told, they're being given lists.
[00:41:11.524 --> 00:41:12.124]  It's in the news.
[00:41:12.264 --> 00:41:13.525]  You cannot talk about Christ.
[00:41:13.565 --> 00:41:14.565]  You cannot talk about God.
[00:41:14.585 --> 00:41:15.546]  You cannot talk about Christianity.
[00:41:15.866 --> 00:41:18.027]  Oh, they can have Satanism clubs at all the schools now.
[00:41:18.347 --> 00:41:19.047]  Many of them have those.
[00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:20.128]  You can have whatever you want.
[00:41:20.428 --> 00:41:25.750]  But you don't have the right to say Jesus in a commencement even though it's your speech and totally protected.
[00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.191]  That's the left, allied worldwide.
[00:41:28.452 --> 00:41:30.993]  Hollywood, the Chai Koms, the radical Islamists.
[00:41:32.654 --> 00:41:33.254]  The EU.
[00:41:33.934 --> 00:41:38.715]  It's all allied against everyone's free speech and individual free market capitalism.
[00:41:39.175 --> 00:41:44.257]  Because they're global corporate combines coming in using authoritarianism to centralize control.
[00:41:44.597 --> 00:41:47.577]  This is the great 21st century war.
[00:41:47.717 --> 00:41:48.158]  It's here.
[00:41:48.418 --> 00:41:50.298]  And if people can just understand it, we'll win it.
[00:41:51.038 --> 00:41:52.138]  And Trump understands it.
[00:41:53.339 --> 00:41:54.359]  So all of you leftists
[00:41:55.731 --> 00:42:00.373]  Trump is doing policies that any mainline analyst admits really will help the average person.
[00:42:00.593 --> 00:42:03.295]  He's fighting as hard as he can for you and this country.
[00:42:03.835 --> 00:42:05.736]  And a lot of leftists think it's dumb to be a nationalist.
[00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:07.517]  They go, oh, that's all backwards and whatever.
[00:42:07.797 --> 00:42:09.518]  Well, what is the global government?
[00:42:09.578 --> 00:42:15.520]  It's the EU and Communist China and a bunch of megabanks allied with a 1.8, I keep saying 1.3, that's old numbers.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:16.041]  1.8 billion Muslims!
[00:42:16.061 --> 00:42:17.501]  That was 1.3 five years ago!
[00:42:17.521 --> 00:42:17.802]  It's 1.8 now!
[00:42:25.694 --> 00:42:26.615]  Game over, man!
[00:42:26.655 --> 00:42:27.336]  Game over!
[00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:32.323]  It's insane!
[00:42:33.464 --> 00:42:34.946]  By the way, I'm gonna come back from breakin' it.
[00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:36.148]  Most important news yet.
[00:42:36.568 --> 00:42:37.569]  We got a bunch of guests comin' up.
[00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:38.531]  I wanna put the phones up as well.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.501]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[00:42:41.761 --> 00:42:50.406]  We always have shipping that's free over $50, but it's store-wide free shipping running for Memorial Day specials, some of the biggest specials of the year, and your purchase makes it all possible.
[00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:52.948]  Brain Force is 50% off.
[00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:56.770]  Brain Force, our top-selling, amazing nootropic, is 50% off.
[00:42:57.031 --> 00:42:58.692]  That's $19.95 right now.
[00:42:59.092 --> 00:43:00.032]  Leading competitors are like $60.
[00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:10.478]  I don't know how you feel about this, but keep a gun in your house, and if you think someone's gonna assault you, or rape you, blow their head off, man!
[00:43:21.314 --> 00:43:23.236]  Kinnison was born in Peoria, Illinois.
[00:43:23.516 --> 00:43:27.739]  He died when a pickup truck slammed into his car near Needles, California last night.
[00:43:27.859 --> 00:43:33.024]  The body of Nirvana's lead singer and songwriter was found today in a guest cottage at his Seattle home.
[00:43:33.564 --> 00:43:37.687]  The medical examiner says he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
[00:43:37.907 --> 00:43:40.570]  All of a sudden, police brutality had a human face.
[00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:46.314]  The face belonged to Rodney King, a black male being brutally beaten and kicked by Los Angeles police officers.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.802]  Oh, look at that.
[00:43:53.443 --> 00:43:53.923]  Terrible!
[00:43:54.244 --> 00:43:56.026]  And there's no police presence down here.
[00:43:56.186 --> 00:43:57.147]  Nobody's helping us.
[00:43:57.207 --> 00:43:58.669]  This is attempted murder.
[00:43:58.729 --> 00:44:06.198]  The Korean merchants walked out of the stores and they just started firing at everybody and anybody.
[00:44:14.015 --> 00:44:15.377]  That's not right!
[00:44:15.397 --> 00:44:16.559]  That's not right!
[00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:17.120]  You mad?
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.463]  So what is that?
[00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:20.384]  What is your business?
[00:44:20.404 --> 00:44:21.025]  Kicked in the head.
[00:44:21.365 --> 00:44:22.427]  He's laying in the street.
[00:44:22.447 --> 00:44:24.189]  Terrible, terrible pictures.
[00:44:24.609 --> 00:44:26.752]  All this guy did was enter this area.
[00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:27.854]  Hit the siren, Doug.
[00:44:33.527 --> 00:44:38.089]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.610]  Thanks for calling.
[00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.610]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:44:40.091 --> 00:44:43.652]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:44:43.712 --> 00:44:52.457]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:44:52.577 --> 00:45:08.745]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[00:45:09.245 --> 00:45:17.772]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:45:17.852 --> 00:45:22.615]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:45:22.736 --> 00:45:28.020]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[00:45:35.666 --> 00:45:37.527]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:45:37.547 --> 00:45:37.827]  Go ahead.
[00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:41.928]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:45:41.948 --> 00:45:47.009]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:45:47.529 --> 00:45:53.071]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[00:45:53.931 --> 00:46:02.198]  I feel that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:46:03.039 --> 00:46:05.741]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:46:06.422 --> 00:46:10.065]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, 5 days a week.
[00:46:10.165 --> 00:46:16.971]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[00:46:17.631 --> 00:46:21.772]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:46:22.192 --> 00:46:25.493]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:46:26.173 --> 00:46:30.434]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[00:46:30.934 --> 00:46:36.536]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well at water.
[00:46:36.596 --> 00:46:41.097]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:46:41.977 --> 00:46:43.277]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:46:43.478 --> 00:46:48.779]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:46:48.799 --> 00:46:50.180]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:50.340]  Yeah.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.360]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.221]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:46:53.261 --> 00:46:54.941]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[00:46:54.981 --> 00:46:55.962]  We really appreciate you.
[00:46:56.322 --> 00:46:57.002]  Keep up the fight.
[00:46:57.042 --> 00:46:58.442]  We need to take California back.
[00:46:58.462 --> 00:46:58.862]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:46:58.902 --> 00:46:59.943]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[00:46:59.983 --> 00:47:00.643]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:47:06.325 --> 00:47:08.946]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.846 --> 00:47:37.392]  We've got live footage of the U.S.
[00:47:37.412 --> 00:47:48.279]  Naval Academy commencement and it's been going for like an hour with President Trump shaking hands but it just ended with Trump hugging I guess the last sailor that came through.
[00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:55.864]  I know we're recording the satellite feeds it says record on there maybe we can back that up because it's just that image of like an hour of Trump.
[00:47:56.784 --> 00:47:57.665]  Shaking hands.
[00:47:59.846 --> 00:48:00.407]  It's amazing.
[00:48:00.427 --> 00:48:07.372]  You know, part of us being a real TV network that we're launching is we've got all these dozens of satellite feeds and satellite dishes and uplinks and everything.
[00:48:07.953 --> 00:48:15.378]  It's crazy watching all these raw feeds of volcanoes and missile tests and Trump speeches you never see on the news.
[00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:17.180]  It's amazing.
[00:48:18.141 --> 00:48:20.743]  But that image of him, I mean, when did you see
[00:48:21.989 --> 00:48:24.090]  Obama shaking everybody's hand at a commencement.
[00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:24.790]  I don't think he did that.
[00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:26.871]  Or hugging people.
[00:48:28.671 --> 00:48:30.412]  The people wanting to hug the president.
[00:48:31.152 --> 00:48:36.213]  Because we went to that like a second too late for you to see him hugging the last person coming to the line.
[00:48:37.374 --> 00:48:38.374]  Just that personal touch.
[00:48:39.674 --> 00:48:42.115]  The way Trump one time called my wife.
[00:48:44.276 --> 00:48:46.236]  Just to tell her how great I was.
[00:48:47.237 --> 00:48:48.677]  And that's just a classy thing to do.
[00:48:49.197 --> 00:48:50.838]  And you know my wife treats me really good.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:57.142]  Ever since that little five minute conversation or whatever, she's treated me even that much better.
[00:48:57.182 --> 00:49:00.224]  It's just, it's that, it's that, it's that magic.
[00:49:00.344 --> 00:49:03.505]  And it's not the celebrity of it, it's the fact that he really does that.
[00:49:04.125 --> 00:49:11.809]  Hundreds of calls, every time a cop gets killed, he calls the family, and then a lot of times sends a sizable donation.
[00:49:12.802 --> 00:49:15.963]  And of course no one ever even knows about that because Trump demands that they not be told about it.
[00:49:16.003 --> 00:49:16.944]  But that's what Trump does.
[00:49:16.964 --> 00:49:18.544]  You talk about Mr. Classy?
[00:49:19.145 --> 00:49:19.585]  He's it.
[00:49:20.045 --> 00:49:20.485]  His wife?
[00:49:21.105 --> 00:49:21.826]  Mrs. Classy.
[00:49:23.006 --> 00:49:24.107]  And so here we've backed this up.
[00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:25.727]  We see he hugs the last person.
[00:49:25.747 --> 00:49:26.327]  He might know them.
[00:49:26.708 --> 00:49:28.908]  But it's just those little things like that.
[00:49:30.209 --> 00:49:33.870]  And this country has been taken over by the globalists, by the communist Chinese.
[00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:34.911]  It was being demoralized.
[00:49:34.951 --> 00:49:37.212]  It was being de-industrialized by design.
[00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:42.111]  Lloyd Blankfein just a year ago was saying, you'll never reboot America, you're going to fail Trump.
[00:49:42.171 --> 00:49:43.752]  Well, notice he's out at Goldman Sachs.
[00:49:44.512 --> 00:49:48.474]  Trump is really using the power of the executive to break heads.
[00:49:48.494 --> 00:49:50.835]  And that's why the media, owned by the globalists, is so mad.
[00:49:50.935 --> 00:49:53.176]  Because Trump isn't even trying to destroy the globalists.
[00:49:53.436 --> 00:49:55.817]  He's just saying, you're not going to break America's back.
[00:49:56.858 --> 00:50:03.541]  You are not going to sit there and totally shut this country down.
[00:50:04.554 --> 00:50:06.516]  He just says, this is pragmatically stupid.
[00:50:06.817 --> 00:50:07.497]  I love America.
[00:50:07.918 --> 00:50:09.660]  Well, it has to fall for the global system.
[00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:12.183]  He's like, no, it's not going to fall.
[00:50:12.643 --> 00:50:22.514]  So all of you rooting against Trump and against me and against the Republic and against free market, look at Venezuela, look at North Korea, look at communism.
[00:50:22.854 --> 00:50:23.575]  It doesn't work.
[00:50:23.936 --> 00:50:25.838]  Look at the big corporations being tax exempt.
[00:50:27.884 --> 00:50:43.270]  And Bloomberg, who's famous for avoiding almost all of his taxes, along with Bill Gates and Ted Turner and all these people, when you avoid hundreds of billions in taxes and only pay 0.3% like Google, you're a philanthropist.
[00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:45.691]  You're a philanthropic organization.
[00:50:48.472 --> 00:50:49.032]  Think about that.
[00:50:49.861 --> 00:50:59.447]  And you wonder why they're all in charge and just get bigger and bigger and why we went from, you know, 1% having 40% of the wealth to like 1% having 70% of the wealth.
[00:51:00.768 --> 00:51:05.851]  And it's because that one-tenth of one-tenth of 1% really has almost all the wealth.
[00:51:07.692 --> 00:51:09.133]  The 1% is a lie.
[00:51:09.393 --> 00:51:12.575]  All the kingpin liberals pay almost nothing.
[00:51:12.715 --> 00:51:15.837]  And then Bloomberg says poor people should pay more tax.
[00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:23.354]  But he's not the Mitt Romney argument of, if poor people paid more taxes, they wouldn't want higher taxes.
[00:51:25.535 --> 00:51:25.976]  No, no, no.
[00:51:26.056 --> 00:51:30.038]  He wants you dependent, but says the tax money makes your life better.
[00:51:30.358 --> 00:51:32.160]  He said, have higher taxes or die.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.121]  Was the quote.
[00:51:35.021 --> 00:51:41.165]  But he knows full well that the top 1% pays most of the taxes.
[00:51:42.546 --> 00:51:44.748]  But see, that's not the top .0000000024.
[00:51:50.003 --> 00:51:54.425]  It's the 99 plus percent of the 1% that pays most of the taxes.
[00:51:54.645 --> 00:51:58.187]  But if you're making $250,000 a year, you're in the 1%, see?
[00:51:58.487 --> 00:52:04.530]  But if you're making $12 billion in a day, like Jeff Bezos, oh, then you're tax exempt.
[00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:05.371]  See the big trick?
[00:52:05.971 --> 00:52:10.753]  And so they've got the general public thinking somebody making a half mil a year, paying 40% federal tax,
[00:52:15.669 --> 00:52:20.390]  Only keeping a couple hundred thousand dollars of the money is the rich people that have to be gotten.
[00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:23.311]  The ultra-rich are really smart.
[00:52:24.972 --> 00:52:29.373]  They know how to manipulate the poor people against the middle class, which is their way out of it.
[00:52:31.294 --> 00:52:31.574]  All right.
[00:52:33.974 --> 00:52:38.096]  Coming up, we're going to get more into Weinstein and the Purple Walk.
[00:52:38.116 --> 00:52:42.597]  We're going to get into the attack on the First Amendment, the big news that this GDPR
[00:52:44.022 --> 00:52:47.403]  The EU passed a few years ago that went into effect yesterday.
[00:52:49.143 --> 00:52:52.904]  Thousands of major websites, including the LA Times, you name it, are not even online.
[00:52:53.444 --> 00:52:56.424]  In Europe, they're blocking people because it doesn't comply with the rules.
[00:52:57.484 --> 00:53:00.345]  And this is economic warfare.
[00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:05.626]  And whereas I am for privacy, this has nothing to do with privacy.
[00:53:05.646 --> 00:53:07.446]  This is all about EU control of the Internet.
[00:53:07.866 --> 00:53:09.366]  And they're working with Communist China.
[00:53:09.386 --> 00:53:12.927]  And again, I'm going to tell you, China is not involved in it.
[00:53:13.697 --> 00:53:20.779]  The EU's claiming if your companies stream over the internet into our countries, or are visible here, we claim jurisdiction over you.
[00:53:21.739 --> 00:53:32.463]  And we are going to sue you in the US and fine you in Europe, and our regulators are saying they're going to roll over and go with that because they're liberals, they're globalists, they're Obama people that were put in, and Hillary people.
[00:53:35.084 --> 00:53:39.325]  So we're going under EU internet control to shut us down, and China is exempt.
[00:53:46.294 --> 00:53:47.694]  I'm not defending Google and Facebook.
[00:53:47.714 --> 00:53:51.615]  The point is, is this is all part of the attempt to take down of America.
[00:53:53.435 --> 00:53:55.416]  And these globalists all bet on the wrong team.
[00:53:56.136 --> 00:54:07.858]  And now we are facing, as Americans, the Communist Chinese, the Socialist EU, unelected, 1.8 million Muslims, Hollywood, and all the brainwashed leftists and people in this country.
[00:54:08.078 --> 00:54:13.179]  By the way, we have a special surprise guest in studio today that, believe me, you don't want to miss.
[00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:23.591]  We're very excited about this and believe me, this individual was one of the biggest news stories this week.
[00:54:26.653 --> 00:54:35.478]  I think I'll tell you at the start of the next hour who will then be in studio coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:54:35.498 --> 00:54:38.420]  We're very excited about this.
[00:54:39.341 --> 00:54:40.141]  Just gonna leave it at that.
[00:54:40.161 --> 00:54:42.763]  In fact, is he here yet?
[00:54:44.534 --> 00:54:53.659]  He's here, wow, we really thank him for flying down here from New York.
[00:54:57.381 --> 00:55:02.424]  He's the fella who got evicted by his parents in court this week.
[00:55:02.484 --> 00:55:04.285]  He's going to be with us in studio today.
[00:55:05.525 --> 00:55:06.486]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:08.024 --> 00:55:13.831]  So we're looking forward to having this discussion after Mark Rondazzo, one of the top free speech lawyers in the country, joins us.
[00:55:13.851 --> 00:55:15.093]  30-year-old man evicted by parents.
[00:55:16.054 --> 00:55:17.276]  Says, I'm not a crazy person.
[00:55:17.316 --> 00:55:19.158]  Well, I think he's an interesting fellow.
[00:55:19.198 --> 00:55:22.923]  We're going to talk to him and you're going to hear from him unfiltered live.
[00:55:26.707 --> 00:55:28.869]  So good job to the producer for getting him here and I thank him for coming.
[00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:49.005]  Now, before I go any further, I need you to go to InfoWarsTore.com and I need you to get the great products and I need you to see how great they are and then come back and sign up for auto-ship on things like our Wake Up America Coffee, things like Brain Force, things like DNA Force, things like Bio-Truth Selenium, things like Super Melon Vitality, the real Red Pill Plus, now with energy.
[00:55:50.086 --> 00:55:53.429]  We have original Red Pill Plus and a Red Pill Plus with the energy.
[00:55:55.216 --> 00:55:57.658]  Memorial Day free shipping.
[00:55:58.118 --> 00:56:10.688]  Whether you're buying a 1995 bottle of Brain Force at 50% off or whether you're getting the Real Red Pill Plus or the Real Red Pill, it's all 50% off and free shipping.
[00:56:12.089 --> 00:56:17.794]  We have not done a deal this good since Christmas five months ago.
[00:56:18.976 --> 00:56:19.796]  Almost six months ago.
[00:56:20.616 --> 00:56:25.658]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:56:25.678 --> 00:56:30.359]  We also have some great books, The Killing of Uncle Sam, great to read it, great to donate to the library.
[00:56:30.699 --> 00:56:32.180]  It's an excellent book, Exposing Globalism.
[00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.661]  We've got Stone's Rules, amazing new book from Roger Stone.
[00:56:36.621 --> 00:56:38.061]  That's available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:56:39.061 --> 00:56:44.583]  But we've got free shipping, and we've got Brain Force Plus,
[00:56:46.902 --> 00:56:47.122]  50% off.
[00:56:47.262 --> 00:56:48.303]  You just cannot beat that.
[00:56:48.363 --> 00:56:51.744]  Leading competitors that have similar formulas are $60 retail.
[00:56:52.544 --> 00:56:57.686]  We're normally $39.95 retail, and it's a great deal and got thousands of five stars.
[00:57:00.967 --> 00:57:05.088]  Well, now Rainforest Plus is 50% off.
[00:57:05.108 --> 00:57:05.088]  $19.95.
[00:57:05.428 --> 00:57:07.829]  You cannot, from our research, get a better deal.
[00:57:08.269 --> 00:57:14.251]  Try it for yourself, but it's designed to be natural and a healthy way to have energy, focus, clarity,
[00:57:16.578 --> 00:57:19.240]  But I have to tell you, different strokes for different folks.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:21.502]  We have Alpha Power that's for body and brain.
[00:57:22.122 --> 00:57:23.123]  It blows people away.
[00:57:23.603 --> 00:57:25.084]  Alpha Power is 50% off right now.
[00:57:25.545 --> 00:57:27.146]  And in different formulas people like.
[00:57:28.227 --> 00:57:30.609]  Like Anthroplex, some people like it better than Alpha Power.
[00:57:30.629 --> 00:57:32.450]  It's apples and oranges for your body.
[00:57:33.331 --> 00:57:39.776]  I will tell you though, we're coming out with something in a couple months that we're going to put a warning on the label, even though it's all generally seen as safe and everything.
[00:57:40.236 --> 00:57:43.759]  It is double the serving size of anything anyone's ever come up with.
[00:57:44.299 --> 00:57:45.180]  And it is
[00:57:47.152 --> 00:57:47.953]  It's turbo force.
[00:57:48.794 --> 00:57:49.315]  We'll be back.
[00:57:49.355 --> 00:57:49.815]  Stay with us.
[00:57:52.058 --> 00:57:54.721]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:57:55.141 --> 00:58:00.267]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:58:00.948 --> 00:58:03.871]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:58:04.312 --> 00:58:07.835]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:58:08.436 --> 00:58:19.722]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:58:20.342 --> 00:58:31.108]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:58:31.408 --> 00:58:36.831]  You can support us by going to the InfoWars store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[00:58:37.172 --> 00:58:37.632]  Take a look!
[00:58:37.972 --> 00:58:41.174]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:58:41.194 --> 00:58:45.536]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:02.075]  It just gets old, man.
[00:59:02.375 --> 00:59:04.076]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:59:04.797 --> 00:59:06.878]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:59:07.118 --> 00:59:11.101]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:59:11.121 --> 00:59:13.642]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:59:14.443 --> 00:59:16.784]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:59:17.125 --> 00:59:18.225]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:59:18.485 --> 00:59:19.366]  Us being shut down?
[00:59:19.586 --> 00:59:20.627]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:59:21.067 --> 00:59:22.108]  You know what, Alex?
[00:59:22.128 --> 00:59:23.229]  Put him on pause again.
[00:59:23.249 --> 00:59:24.070]  Hey, Frank!
[00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:29.694]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:59:30.014 --> 00:59:34.298]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:59:34.518 --> 00:59:37.381]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:59:37.401 --> 00:59:38.041]  Do you understand?
[00:59:38.121 --> 00:59:39.402]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:59:39.763 --> 00:59:40.944]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:59:41.904 --> 00:59:46.828]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:48.470]  Do you understand?
[00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:49.671]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:59:54.491 --> 00:59:58.613]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.133 --> 01:00:00.453]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:01.574 --> 01:00:09.457]  We are on the march.
[01:00:10.197 --> 01:00:13.418]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:00:13.438 --> 01:00:17.020]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:25.885 --> 01:00:29.889]  Coming up in 30 minutes, in studio, he is in the building.
[01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:33.712]  Michael Rotondo, one of the top stories this week.
[01:00:35.274 --> 01:00:42.000]  The individual who at 30 was evicted by a court from his parents' home, that he was not wanting to leave.
[01:00:43.241 --> 01:00:46.104]  He is going to be in studio with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:46.765 --> 01:00:49.948]  Here is a clip of him talking about it.
[01:00:51.332 --> 01:00:55.335]  This 30-year-old dude is facing an eviction threat from his own parents.
[01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:57.076]  That's just so ridiculous.
[01:00:57.136 --> 01:01:01.920]  Michael Rotundo's mom and dad are so fed up, they're suing to get him out of the house.
[01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:05.142]  I don't see why the judge wants to throw people out on the street.
[01:01:05.502 --> 01:01:12.247]  His parents filed the extraordinary lawsuit following months of repeated attempts to get him to leave their home in Syracuse, New York.
[01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:14.829]  And the story is getting lots of attention.
[01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:19.372]  A judge asked why he didn't just move in with his girlfriend, and the man said, Girlfriend?
[01:01:19.452 --> 01:01:21.273]  I'm a 30-year-old man living at home.
[01:01:21.353 --> 01:01:23.035]  Dude, there's no girlfriend.
[01:01:24.316 --> 01:01:29.679]  I just think... It's the first Empty Nest by Eviction.
[01:01:29.859 --> 01:01:31.581]  We are men who still live at home.
[01:01:31.741 --> 01:01:32.001]  Yes.
[01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:35.924]  It's reminding many of a real-life failure to launch.
[01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:39.966]  The 2006 movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Bradley Cooper.
[01:01:40.347 --> 01:01:43.309]  It's gonna take a stick of dynamite to get me out of my parents' house.
[01:01:44.758 --> 01:01:47.420]  Thirty-year-old Michael Rotundo says he has no money.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.483]  He's actually a dad himself, but he lost custody and visitation rights.
[01:01:51.923 --> 01:01:56.547]  His parents say he's a freeloader who never offered to pay rent or do chores.
[01:01:56.887 --> 01:02:00.850]  He's apparently so thrifty, he filled his water bottle with the court's pitcher.
[01:02:01.070 --> 01:02:04.613]  Christina and Mark Rotundo served their son five official notices.
[01:02:04.973 --> 01:02:09.557]  Okay, he is in the building, ladies and gentlemen, and, you know, the leftist media is attacking this guy.
[01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:15.634]  But at the same time, the conservative media is, but wait, they're the ones that want us to be dependent.
[01:02:16.174 --> 01:02:20.618]  They're the ones in San Francisco and everywhere that say we should just absolutely pay for bums.
[01:02:21.278 --> 01:02:25.161]  San Francisco's paid for thousands of homeless people to have sex changes.
[01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:27.162]  Look it up.
[01:02:28.063 --> 01:02:28.824]  So I don't want to hear it.
[01:02:29.724 --> 01:02:33.527]  I already got to pay for abortions for people in Travis County, whether you're for abortion or against it.
[01:02:33.827 --> 01:02:35.248]  Taxpayers shouldn't be paying for it.
[01:02:36.129 --> 01:02:37.430]  I got to pay for sex changes.
[01:02:38.564 --> 01:02:39.225]  I'm sick of it.
[01:02:40.045 --> 01:02:40.706]  Let me tell you something.
[01:02:40.726 --> 01:02:42.767]  You want to chop your junk off, that's your business.
[01:02:42.807 --> 01:02:43.388]  I'm a libertarian.
[01:02:43.748 --> 01:02:44.869]  Don't make me pay for it!
[01:02:44.889 --> 01:02:49.012]  Just like if you want a nose job, or you want a facelift, it's the same thing.
[01:02:49.112 --> 01:02:50.173]  I'm not paying for it.
[01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:53.435]  It's incredible.
[01:02:53.475 --> 01:03:02.922]  But the left will pay for sex changes of six-year-old kids in England, but they won't pay for a little four-year-old girl who has a leg that's four inches too short.
[01:03:04.503 --> 01:03:05.264]  It's a $5,000 surgery here in the U.S.
[01:03:05.304 --> 01:03:05.344]  to
[01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:11.189]  Go in and have the bone fused in, and when she's a little bit older, have to do another surgery.
[01:03:11.669 --> 01:03:14.110]  But they just told her, we're going to cut your leg off, cupcake.
[01:03:14.671 --> 01:03:19.793]  See, it's all about the leftist and their weird, sick social engineering, having full control.
[01:03:20.454 --> 01:03:22.255]  Oh, we're not going to give you cataract surgery.
[01:03:22.935 --> 01:03:23.616]  Here's your cane.
[01:03:24.276 --> 01:03:32.060]  Oh, they got more doctors than anybody per capita in the world in places like Cuba and Venezuela, but there's no machines or medicine.
[01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:33.601]  Got a broken leg?
[01:03:33.741 --> 01:03:34.101]  Cane.
[01:03:34.581 --> 01:03:35.262]  Got a bad knee?
[01:03:35.322 --> 01:03:35.662]  Cane.
[01:03:36.042 --> 01:03:36.663]  Going blind?
[01:03:36.803 --> 01:03:37.103]  Cane.
[01:03:38.963 --> 01:03:41.022]  Stand up and speak out, they beat you over the head with a cane.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.340]  That doesn't do it.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.622]  They take you out in the fields, fire in squads, shoot you.
[01:03:47.002 --> 01:03:49.644]  And every little liberal trendy and Bernie Sanders loves it.
[01:04:16.763 --> 01:04:18.064]  You don't need all that.
[01:04:18.084 --> 01:04:19.265]  I just need an Audi A8.
[01:04:19.285 --> 01:04:19.765]  No big deal.
[01:04:19.785 --> 01:04:19.765]  $120,000.
[01:04:19.805 --> 01:04:22.348]  Venezuela is a really good place though.
[01:04:34.312 --> 01:04:38.655]  When we return, Martin Randazzo, one of the top free speech lawyers in the country.
[01:04:39.035 --> 01:04:41.677]  I've talked to my lawyer, he says, oh, that guy's awesome, we need to get him on the team.
[01:04:41.697 --> 01:04:44.579]  If we're talking about doing that, his liberal friends might crucify him, though.
[01:04:44.999 --> 01:04:46.080]  There's so much going on.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.001]  There's the new Sandy Hook lawsuits against me.
[01:04:48.881 --> 01:04:51.203]  We're going to get into all that.
[01:04:51.463 --> 01:04:53.044]  We're going to talk about all of it.
[01:04:53.224 --> 01:04:58.288]  When we return in T-minus 60 seconds, and then the countdown begins.
[01:04:58.968 --> 01:05:01.870]  Until we have the 30-year-old kid in here.
[01:05:03.883 --> 01:05:07.086]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:05:07.526 --> 01:05:08.847]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:05:09.328 --> 01:05:20.859]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:26.665]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:05:27.005 --> 01:05:30.466]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:36.707]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:05:36.927 --> 01:05:41.588]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:05:42.088 --> 01:05:44.409]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:05:44.749 --> 01:05:46.089]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:05:46.489 --> 01:05:51.390]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:56.095]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:05:56.215 --> 01:05:58.358]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:05:58.898 --> 01:06:03.764]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:06:05.673 --> 01:06:11.374]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:11.454 --> 01:06:13.555]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:15.835 --> 01:06:21.537]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:23.397 --> 01:06:25.397]  We see the earth.
[01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:27.738]  We see the earth now.
[01:06:33.528 --> 01:06:40.610]  Well, Mark Randazza, one of the top free speech first-minute lawyers in the country, is popping in for the next two segments with us at Randazza.com.
[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:49.773]  He's got Randazza Legal and a whole bunch of states, including Connecticut, where we just got sued by more of the Sandy Hook parents and an FBI agent.
[01:06:50.413 --> 01:06:59.636]  And my lawyers, and I even had some other lawyers look at it, like Mr. Randazza, looked at it and they said, this is the next level of a frivolous lawsuit.
[01:07:00.396 --> 01:07:00.616]  I mean,
[01:07:03.672 --> 01:07:04.892]  They've got stuff out of context.
[01:07:05.072 --> 01:07:06.453]  It was in statute of limitations.
[01:07:07.853 --> 01:07:10.694]  So it's not even admissible, and that's not even accurate.
[01:07:11.154 --> 01:07:12.994]  And I don't even know who this FBI agent is.
[01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:15.115]  It's just a way to run this all through the media.
[01:07:15.135 --> 01:07:17.436]  But I wanted to get his take on that a little bit.
[01:07:17.516 --> 01:07:27.858]  But also on just the attacks on free speech in general, on conservatives, libertarians online, and where he thinks that's going.
[01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.719]  And then I want to tie it into Morgan Freedman.
[01:07:31.209 --> 01:07:42.959]  You've got eight women, and then you've got eight other witnesses, or 16 total, so I guess that is eight other witnesses, that he would tell women, you're really hot, I want to go out with you, and you're sexy.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.943]  And the women on TV would go, oh, and kind of giggle about it, and then he would stop.
[01:07:47.483 --> 01:07:48.404]  Is it a creepy old man?
[01:07:49.425 --> 01:07:49.605]  Yeah.
[01:07:49.625 --> 01:07:52.848]  I mean, he's acting like I acted when I was about 18.
[01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.891]  But, you know, that's how you...
[01:07:56.991 --> 01:08:04.257]  Quite frankly, in this world, I mean, if you want to get game as quickly as possible, you may have to run through a bunch of women, but you're going to run into the women that are ready to go.
[01:08:04.758 --> 01:08:20.491]  And James Caan, one of my favorite actors, from Rollerball, you name it, of course, great job in The Godfather, he was asked about Friedman, which is no comparison to Weinstein.
[01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:26.287]  Any thoughts on Morgan Freeman being accused of sexual misconduct?
[01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:54.168]  What do you think about him losing endorsements just over allegations already?
[01:08:54.468 --> 01:08:55.168]  What did you say?
[01:08:55.528 --> 01:08:59.290]  He's already losing endorsements over the allegations that just came out.
[01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:00.030]  I know.
[01:09:01.230 --> 01:09:02.851]  We're becoming a very strange place.
[01:09:03.611 --> 01:09:05.291]  Yeah, Morgan's a great guy.
[01:09:05.771 --> 01:09:10.733]  I think that's why God made men and women so they could be attractive to each other.
[01:09:10.973 --> 01:09:11.253]  Thank you.
[01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:14.490]  Well, actually, there's an attack on men and women.
[01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:15.933]  There's an attack on regular biology.
[01:09:16.114 --> 01:09:17.156]  This is the deep state.
[01:09:17.176 --> 01:09:21.026]  It's in the way she's trying to make us all fight with each other and smokescreen, in my view.
[01:09:22.355 --> 01:09:25.017]  The real sexual abuse going on by elites in this country.
[01:09:25.037 --> 01:09:28.078]  But that's another issue that ties into speech.
[01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:35.122]  My right to tell a woman, I think you're gorgeous, on the street or at a ticket counter or wherever.
[01:09:35.162 --> 01:09:36.403]  She says, buzz off, pal.
[01:09:36.683 --> 01:09:37.524]  And I don't buzz off.
[01:09:37.804 --> 01:09:39.025]  You know, then there can be an issue.
[01:09:40.025 --> 01:09:41.646]  But men don't even do that now.
[01:09:41.726 --> 01:09:44.148]  Men are like all this in the West and scared of women.
[01:09:44.568 --> 01:09:46.829]  Mark, I mean, it's another subject, but it does deal with speech.
[01:09:46.869 --> 01:09:49.771]  What's your take on that as we see Harvey Weinstein doing the perp walk?
[01:09:51.055 --> 01:09:58.820]  Look, you know, there certainly are legitimate sexual harassment and sexual abuse cases.
[01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:05.944]  And if somebody is an employer and has quid pro quo sexual harassment over an employee, that's wrong.
[01:10:06.484 --> 01:10:07.846]  Uh, you know, what Bill Cosby did?
[01:10:08.026 --> 01:10:08.586]  My God.
[01:10:08.606 --> 01:10:10.388]  I mean, I don't even, I don't even get it.
[01:10:10.488 --> 01:10:15.112]  I mean, a celebrity can walk into any bar and say, you know, say to five different women, do you want to go home with me?
[01:10:15.132 --> 01:10:17.234]  One of them is going to go home with him just because he's a celebrity.
[01:10:17.815 --> 01:10:18.756]  Drugging somebody?
[01:10:19.116 --> 01:10:20.497]  I hope the guy dies in prison.
[01:10:21.118 --> 01:10:25.782]  Uh, but you know, now it's, it's like this incremental movement.
[01:10:25.862 --> 01:10:26.903]  It can't ever be.
[01:10:27.344 --> 01:10:28.645]  We've stopped what's bad.
[01:10:29.477 --> 01:10:30.158]  And we're happy.
[01:10:30.699 --> 01:10:33.864]  Now it has to go to, even, the guy hits on a woman?
[01:10:34.405 --> 01:10:38.632]  I mean, come on, look, my advice to all men out there, play the numbers, you know?
[01:10:39.779 --> 01:10:42.941]  I mean, let her decide she doesn't want to sleep with you.
[01:10:43.001 --> 01:10:43.842]  Don't you decide it.
[01:10:44.282 --> 01:10:45.043]  Ask everybody.
[01:10:45.143 --> 01:10:45.623]  Why not?
[01:10:46.183 --> 01:10:47.404]  I don't see a problem with that.
[01:10:48.165 --> 01:10:54.889]  But, you know, there has to be this constant drumbeat to beat down any semblance of masculinity in our culture.
[01:10:55.790 --> 01:11:09.299]  You know, frankly, because, you know, I don't know why, but there's this mental illness that seems to be going through us as a society that we want to completely purge any gender differences and any kind of, you know,
[01:11:09.959 --> 01:11:13.580]  Man, it's like the Fun Patrol showing up in a Jeep every single time.
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.801]  Well, exactly.
[01:11:14.981 --> 01:11:22.343]  Morgan Freeman's not accused of anything that I wouldn't be completely proud to do myself, at least from what I've seen in this segment so far.
[01:11:25.524 --> 01:11:25.964]  Absolutely.
[01:11:26.204 --> 01:11:27.665]  I mean, he's a little pushy.
[01:11:28.185 --> 01:11:30.666]  Some of it to me is creepy, but it's a free country.
[01:11:30.706 --> 01:11:31.446]  And the women, though,
[01:11:32.944 --> 01:11:33.264]  I don't know.
[01:11:42.992 --> 01:11:52.840]  Yeah, look, I wasn't there, but from what I've seen here, the only thing I've seen is that the guy was flirting with women, which I think is... Well, that's the allegation, too.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.642]  They're just saying that he was aggressively flirting with them.
[01:11:54.922 --> 01:12:04.450]  And again, how is that as big a story as Weinstein, which if this is true, and I think there's so many people saying it, and a lot of evidence to it, then I think the guy should, you know, be sent to prison for life.
[01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:21.846]  Yeah, I mean, again, just, you know, when men abuse their position, when men use, either abuse their position of authority or do something forceful or drug a woman, my God, I want to be the, you know, I'll be the first one out there with a pitchfork and a torch.
[01:12:22.526 --> 01:12:30.312]  But it's, it's this, you know, you've got this loud contingent of a very small group of people who really
[01:12:30.959 --> 01:12:35.801]  You know, I think it comes from mental illness from women who just don't like their dads.
[01:12:36.361 --> 01:12:43.504]  They have this paradigm in their head that they think that every guy is somehow evil and they've got to beat this out of society.
[01:12:43.524 --> 01:12:46.805]  That there can be absolutely no masculinity at all.
[01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:53.196]  Um, and it's ultimately going to create, I think, a crisis, if it hasn't already.
[01:12:53.216 --> 01:12:55.398]  I mean, we got to be worried about this?
[01:12:55.919 --> 01:13:08.513]  Well, there's a thing also with liberal Democrat Party women, with other Republicans that I know, that they, at like these hotels downtown in Austin, so I'm married, I'm not involved in any of this, but I hear about it from people, the Democrat women
[01:13:09.915 --> 01:13:10.136]  Yeah.
[01:13:22.677 --> 01:13:27.182]  Say that all masculinity is bad, but in truth, they're really looking for somebody to treat them bad.
[01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:31.908]  And you've got 50 Shades of Grey and more and more women into all this bondage stuff.
[01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:35.532]  So, like you said, it really just sounds like insanity to me.
[01:13:36.073 --> 01:13:42.260]  And I think it distracts from real bad things that are happening to women, to conflate hitting on a girl with raping them.
[01:13:43.517 --> 01:13:46.278]  Yeah, I mean look, that is the problem.
[01:13:46.318 --> 01:13:50.680]  That there is this argument that it's a continuum from flirting to rape.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:54.882]  And no, rape and sexual assault is an act of violence.
[01:13:55.543 --> 01:13:59.464]  Flirting, hell, that's the first step in the reproductive process.
[01:13:59.845 --> 01:14:00.625]  Are you interested?
[01:14:02.467 --> 01:14:10.172]  You know, as far as these women at the hotels that want to be mistreated, I don't know, and I think that's a dangerous way for guys to look at it.
[01:14:11.473 --> 01:14:14.875]  I mean, I can certainly say that I've bumped into that.
[01:14:15.735 --> 01:14:16.396]  Not my thing.
[01:14:17.056 --> 01:14:24.981]  Not my thing either, but that's what I'm saying is, that's growing, and it's generally with women that claim they're liberal and hate all men.
[01:14:25.221 --> 01:14:30.485]  It's like well-known that interracial porn outsells 3 to 1, 4 to 1 in the Deep South to white males.
[01:14:32.169 --> 01:14:33.970]  I didn't know that, but yeah, maybe.
[01:14:34.110 --> 01:14:35.551]  That's a statistic, but it's the same thing.
[01:14:38.252 --> 01:14:41.654]  Take women on women relationships and the amount of abuse that goes on there.
[01:14:41.874 --> 01:14:43.715]  These are real statistics they don't want to discuss.
[01:14:44.135 --> 01:14:44.976]  I don't know what they mean.
[01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:47.690]  I don't know.
[01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:48.910]  Well, I know what they mean.
[01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:53.494]  And that is that, look, it's everything is about power and domination.
[01:14:54.094 --> 01:14:54.775]  Everything.
[01:14:54.995 --> 01:15:05.162]  So imagine if you could walk into a room and everybody's supposed to play a certain game, but all you have to do is, you know, pull one card and you're automatically at a disadvantage.
[01:15:06.423 --> 01:15:13.048]  You know, this is a good way to target anyone and everyone who you might want to eliminate or climb on top of.
[01:15:13.548 --> 01:15:15.630]  It's it's the it's the victim Olympics.
[01:15:16.172 --> 01:15:18.334]  Let me ask you this before we go to break and come back to the First Amendment.
[01:15:19.375 --> 01:15:20.876]  When do you think we hit the bottom of this?
[01:15:20.976 --> 01:15:24.179]  When do we hit peak political correctness?
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.642]  One day, in the future, there will be the Uber victim.
[01:15:28.863 --> 01:15:32.105]  It will be one victim to rule over all of them.
[01:15:32.466 --> 01:15:40.112]  There will be a black lesbian in a wheelchair with an eyepatch and every single possible victimization and she will rule.
[01:15:42.014 --> 01:15:43.315]  So it ends with
[01:15:44.429 --> 01:15:45.710]  It's dystopian.
[01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:54.893]  Look, it's a dystopian fairy tale, but you know, it really is like this race to see who can be strong through victimization.
[01:15:55.053 --> 01:15:56.073]  That's right.
[01:15:56.213 --> 01:16:00.395]  It's a race to make everybody be weak and lazy and stupid so they can be controlled.
[01:16:03.096 --> 01:16:07.998]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:17.365]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:19.846 --> 01:16:25.947]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:27.347 --> 01:16:29.888]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:30.688 --> 01:16:34.108]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:37.169]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[01:16:38.925 --> 01:16:44.107]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:46.048 --> 01:16:52.651]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:53.612 --> 01:16:54.632]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:56.013 --> 01:17:02.856]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:17:03.376 --> 01:17:04.677]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:05.837 --> 01:17:07.178]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:09.181 --> 01:17:20.089]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:20.809 --> 01:17:22.350]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:34.679]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:35.239 --> 01:17:37.441]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:38.462 --> 01:17:47.469]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:48.049 --> 01:17:53.473]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:54.594 --> 01:18:02.480]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:09.456]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States.
[01:18:10.957 --> 01:18:12.959]  Another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:13.419 --> 01:18:14.940]  That's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:18.602]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.224]  We have more than that tuned in over the years.
[01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:26.147]  The point is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:27.248 --> 01:18:37.993]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:38.073 --> 01:18:42.015]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:44.100]  Our game is changing.
[01:19:04.079 --> 01:19:06.621]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:06.661 --> 01:19:14.546]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:15.166 --> 01:19:26.314]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[01:19:26.754 --> 01:19:33.639]  Silver, salt, nano-silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint, essential oil, and so much more.
[01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:36.060]  Thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:06.866 --> 01:20:11.528]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.435 --> 01:20:31.417]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.954 --> 01:20:37.536]  Okay, I got sidetracked over into the Harvey Weinstein situation.
[01:20:37.556 --> 01:20:40.638]  And from what I've heard, people that know him, and he is a monstrous pig.
[01:20:41.239 --> 01:20:43.160]  I said that he reportedly raped women first.
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:50.545]  I was attacked by major publications on the left, like the Huffington Post, saying how Jones made outrageous claims.
[01:20:50.785 --> 01:20:53.686]  He said there's a cult, too, where they brand women and torture them.
[01:20:53.907 --> 01:20:55.428]  Well, I didn't want to say the name and get sued.
[01:20:55.448 --> 01:20:59.210]  I knew about NXIVM from people that had been on the periphery of it.
[01:20:59.730 --> 01:21:00.431]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:21:01.471 --> 01:21:01.892]  But yeah.
[01:21:02.572 --> 01:21:06.756]  It's a lot bigger than that, and I heard Obama and Richard Branson were involved, and I said that.
[01:21:07.317 --> 01:21:08.217]  And now it's in the news.
[01:21:08.518 --> 01:21:09.439]  But I'm going to stop right there.
[01:21:09.479 --> 01:21:10.820]  You've got the floor for the time we have.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:13.042]  You're going to be back in studio several hours with us.
[01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:17.927]  Mark Rondasza next Tuesday, because I knew he was a top lawyer, but my lawyers...
[01:21:18.447 --> 01:21:21.049]  You know, when I look at a complaint like this, and I see that it's got what, 394 paragraphs?
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:48.445]  You know, that's not always an indication of something, but it usually is in a case like this, because it's relatively simple facts.
[01:21:49.146 --> 01:21:54.950]  If we look at the facts, they're saying you said something hurtful about them, you said something untrue about them.
[01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:59.493]  That shouldn't require 400 odd paragraphs to explain.
[01:22:00.054 --> 01:22:06.959]  And when I look at this complaint, and I look at how the logical contortions that some of it went through, and I'm going to take
[01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:16.406]  At this point, a judge, if you file a motion to dismiss, is going to take everything in this complaint as true, just for the purpose of a motion to dismiss.
[01:22:16.986 --> 01:22:21.188]  Summary judgment or trial, that's later on when you evaluate the evidence.
[01:22:21.668 --> 01:22:27.010]  Let's look at this and just say every single thing in it is true from a factual perspective.
[01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:30.398]  It still seems like a pretty strange suit to me.
[01:22:31.118 --> 01:22:49.506]  It's trying to, you know, it's funny how when it accuses you of being a conspiracy theorist, but then it creates this, what seems like an implausible conspiracy among you and these other people who happen to just be some of your viewers.
[01:22:50.226 --> 01:22:57.049]  So, you know, if you want to bring, just as a theme, when you write a complaint, you write legal documents, you've got to remember
[01:22:57.853 --> 01:22:59.174]  You're talking to a human being.
[01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:03.137]  At the end of the day, a judge or the judge's clerks is going to read this.
[01:23:03.998 --> 01:23:13.445]  And if you if you create the theme of here's a conspiracy theory against this person we're accusing of being a conspiracy theorist, I think you lose a little rhetorical ground.
[01:23:14.827 --> 01:23:20.731]  Another thing I'm looking at and that I find curious is they've added one defendant.
[01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:22.853]  So this case is filed in Connecticut.
[01:23:23.834 --> 01:23:25.375]  They've added one defendant.
[01:23:25.996 --> 01:23:28.477]  Who's in Connecticut.
[01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:31.398]  So we've got plaintiffs in Connecticut and defendants in Connecticut.
[01:23:31.538 --> 01:23:35.679]  And why that's important is when you have diversity of citizenship.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:41.741]  So you have plaintiffs and defendants from different states and they're seeking in excess of $75,000.
[01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:45.703]  You have the right to remove your case to federal court.
[01:23:46.463 --> 01:23:49.004]  That's something that's been enshrined in the law forever.
[01:23:49.719 --> 01:24:00.282]  Now, when you put somebody who's a nominal defendant on another side of the case so that you have defendant and plaintiffs on in the same state, you lose that right.
[01:24:01.262 --> 01:24:07.764]  So the concern here, I think, is that they really don't want this to get into federal court.
[01:24:08.388 --> 01:24:11.009]  Yeah, and there's a number of reasons for that.
[01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:14.411]  Federal court is perceived to be more defendant-friendly.
[01:24:14.431 --> 01:24:17.633]  It's not to say that I... Sure, I mean, let's just say it.
[01:24:17.873 --> 01:24:19.974]  They want it in local court.
[01:24:21.235 --> 01:24:21.675]  Sure, yeah.
[01:24:21.715 --> 01:24:27.879]  I mean, Connecticut judges are appointed for eight years, and then they can be reappointed.
[01:24:28.859 --> 01:24:33.602]  So if you have something that might be a politically challenging case,
[01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:37.953]  You probably would prefer it to be in state court.
[01:24:38.533 --> 01:24:49.385]  I'm not saying that the judge here isn't going to make a completely above board decision, but the reason that we put into the law this ability to remove to federal court
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.344]  Is because there was a perception that people might get hometowned by state court judges.
[01:24:55.925 --> 01:25:01.829]  Meanwhile, a federal judge, say what you want about lifetime tenure, there are problems with that.
[01:25:02.349 --> 01:25:08.094]  But one of the good things about lifetime tenure for a federal judge is they are completely insulated from politics.
[01:25:08.594 --> 01:25:11.236]  A federal judge can make whatever decision they want.
[01:25:11.376 --> 01:25:15.399]  Article 3 of the Constitution means the judge never has to say he's sorry.
[01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.741]  Sure, so in the time we have left,
[01:25:17.461 --> 01:25:20.603]  You're giving away too much here about the defense here.
[01:25:20.623 --> 01:25:33.171]  I mean, I think the goal here is public relations to drag me through the mud, to bring the shooting back up for political purposes, not by the family, but by the Democrats and by the establishment doing this.
[01:25:33.191 --> 01:25:34.691]  And a lot of them admit that in the news.
[01:25:35.032 --> 01:25:35.652]  But that's their goal.
[01:25:35.672 --> 01:25:41.055]  And then to keep saying that I'm still saying when I never said the way they said I did those things.
[01:25:41.956 --> 01:25:42.916]  They misrepresent it.
[01:25:43.277 --> 01:25:46.819]  They reboot it and then create the trauma they say I created.
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:57.992]  themselves by always bringing it back up and then never saying all the apologies or all the clarifications over the years.
[01:25:58.413 --> 01:26:03.219]  They just reboot the crime against humanity they say I committed.
[01:26:04.537 --> 01:26:16.225]  Well, you know, there is something called the Streisand effect, which means that there's no better way to bring a spotlight to statements that you don't want to hear than to sue over it.
[01:26:16.365 --> 01:26:20.448]  So, yes, they've kicked the beach ball back up in the air here by suing.
[01:26:21.729 --> 01:26:24.791]  As far as what this is part and parcel of, I think
[01:26:25.725 --> 01:26:35.337]  You know, I think we've, when you look at this, you know, you do have allegations in the complaint of people who really have had their feelings hurt by one thing or another.
[01:26:36.385 --> 01:26:37.526]  You can't discount that.
[01:26:37.866 --> 01:26:41.007]  That doesn't mean that I think it's definitely actionable.
[01:26:41.567 --> 01:26:43.968]  You have some problems in this complaint.
[01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:48.190]  Look, a lot of these statements are outside the statute of limitations.
[01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:52.592]  The statute of limitations in Connecticut for defamation is two years.
[01:26:53.412 --> 01:26:54.713]  Three years for other torts.
[01:26:54.753 --> 01:26:55.693]  But it's further than that.
[01:26:55.733 --> 01:26:57.234]  We've gone and pulled some of the statements up.
[01:26:57.834 --> 01:27:05.565]  Some of them are not even accurate in their little snippet, but then right after it, I'm playing devil's advocate and saying, but I don't believe that.
[01:27:05.966 --> 01:27:11.153]  So this is the next level saying you can't even question or talk about what other people are questioning.
[01:27:11.494 --> 01:27:13.256]  It's like this other lawsuit against me here in Texas.
[01:27:14.087 --> 01:27:15.768]  In a complaint like this, you know,
[01:27:42.495 --> 01:27:46.738]  I've seen, I don't know if it's next level, it's a very common thing, to be honest.
[01:27:47.779 --> 01:28:05.872]  Throughout my career, I've seen defamation cases like this where somebody has either motivation to shut somebody up, or simply looking for money, or actually feels genuinely wronged and is looking for the strongest legal theory possible.
[01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:11.185]  So in any event, it's always a plaintiff's attorney in a defamation case.
[01:28:11.946 --> 01:28:16.691]  It's always their desire to cherry pick out the worst of the worst.
[01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:24.498]  And then it's the defense attorney's job to say, hey, wait a minute, you've got to look at what came before and after these quotes and put it all in context.
[01:28:24.518 --> 01:28:25.559]  Here's the decision we have to make.
[01:28:25.679 --> 01:28:27.121]  Context always matters.
[01:28:27.381 --> 01:28:27.781]  Absolutely.
[01:28:27.841 --> 01:28:30.482]  We'll talk again in person on Tuesday here in studio.
[01:28:30.502 --> 01:28:31.643]  I'm Mark Mendoza.
[01:28:31.663 --> 01:28:32.723]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[01:28:32.803 --> 01:28:38.466]  In 20 seconds left, the big question is, do we launch anti-slapback provisions in Texas and Connecticut?
[01:28:38.826 --> 01:28:40.467]  And I think you and I talking, the answer is yes.
[01:28:41.427 --> 01:28:45.649]  I would never forego the opportunity to bring a well-placed anti-slap motion.
[01:28:45.889 --> 01:28:47.930]  And Connecticut has a good anti-slap law.
[01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:52.953]  So, you know, that is something that I think should be considered.
[01:28:53.773 --> 01:28:54.793]  I'm going to direct that on both.
[01:28:54.813 --> 01:28:55.374]  We'll talk soon.
[01:28:55.414 --> 01:28:55.654]  Thank you.
[01:28:56.434 --> 01:28:56.694]  Okay.
[01:28:56.975 --> 01:28:58.556]  We got a big guest coming in studio.
[01:28:58.576 --> 01:29:01.098]  That fellow that was 30 got evicted from his parents' house.
[01:29:02.459 --> 01:29:04.241]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[01:30:00.446 --> 01:30:06.654]  How come Hollywood embraces?
[01:30:07.626 --> 01:30:11.008]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:12.950]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.090]  It was statutory rape.
[01:30:14.230 --> 01:30:14.951]  Yeah, all right.
[01:30:15.011 --> 01:30:17.312]  Well... It's not statutory rape.
[01:30:17.352 --> 01:30:19.454]  You know, he had sex with a minor.
[01:30:19.754 --> 01:30:20.034]  All right?
[01:30:20.054 --> 01:30:21.935]  That's not rape, you know?
[01:30:21.955 --> 01:30:23.797]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[01:30:24.017 --> 01:30:25.278]  That she didn't want to have.
[01:30:25.398 --> 01:30:26.859]  No, that was not the case at all.
[01:30:26.939 --> 01:30:27.999]  She wanted to have it.
[01:30:28.079 --> 01:30:31.261]  Well, in the transcripts... Dated the guy.
[01:30:31.602 --> 01:30:32.442]  Dated the guy.
[01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:37.648]  And found out well you by the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[01:30:37.668 --> 01:30:45.818]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything all right wait a second China with a 13 year old girl, and you're in a grown man.
[01:30:46.218 --> 01:30:48.441]  You know that that's wrong because Look
[01:30:53.087 --> 01:30:55.648]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[01:30:55.748 --> 01:30:58.388]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[01:31:15.057 --> 01:31:18.918]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[01:31:19.319 --> 01:31:29.322]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[01:31:30.363 --> 01:31:35.825]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:48.562]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[01:31:48.922 --> 01:32:05.206]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they can get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[01:32:05.866 --> 01:32:15.350]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career, ever since he became well-known.
[01:32:16.410 --> 01:32:18.291]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[01:32:18.351 --> 01:32:22.853]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[01:32:22.893 --> 01:32:24.293]  That's what I do for a living.
[01:32:24.333 --> 01:32:29.755]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.277]  It's just what you do for a living.
[01:32:34.486 --> 01:32:35.666]  You have a job.
[01:32:36.466 --> 01:32:39.247]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[01:32:39.527 --> 01:32:47.629]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:52.190]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.650]  They have a real problem.
[01:32:54.730 --> 01:32:56.371]  They need to come back down to earth.
[01:32:56.451 --> 01:32:57.871]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[01:33:06.227 --> 01:33:09.033]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.621 --> 01:33:14.023]  We are drugged out!
[01:33:14.705 --> 01:33:16.970]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:33:18.101 --> 01:33:20.363]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:33:20.903 --> 01:33:22.485]  Today it all changes.
[01:33:22.785 --> 01:33:25.327]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:33:25.547 --> 01:33:28.369]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:33:28.609 --> 01:33:33.073]  Einstein says the death and event insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[01:33:33.353 --> 01:33:35.995]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[01:33:36.015 --> 01:33:38.517]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:33:38.857 --> 01:33:40.819]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:41.299 --> 01:33:42.741]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:44.242]  We have the resources.
[01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:50.872]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[01:33:50.892 --> 01:33:52.272]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:33:52.492 --> 01:33:54.053]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:33:54.093 --> 01:33:54.973]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:33:55.153 --> 01:33:56.054]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:33:56.234 --> 01:33:58.435]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:33:58.635 --> 01:34:02.276]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:34:03.817 --> 01:34:07.338]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:34:07.918 --> 01:34:09.679]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:31.021 --> 01:34:33.301]  Michael Rotondo, thanks for coming in studio with us.
[01:34:33.381 --> 01:34:34.001]  Thanks for having me.
[01:34:34.221 --> 01:34:34.561]  You bet.
[01:34:34.721 --> 01:34:39.102]  You have been one of the biggest stories in the United States and in other parts of the world this week.
[01:34:39.442 --> 01:34:40.682]  Mm-hmm.
[01:34:41.363 --> 01:34:42.023]  It's exciting.
[01:34:42.143 --> 01:34:51.004]  It's not what I was... All I wanted was just to get what I asked for, what I believed justice to be.
[01:34:52.025 --> 01:34:54.225]  I didn't really want to have to
[01:34:55.942 --> 01:34:58.683]  Have it turn into a media thing, but it's fine.
[01:34:59.023 --> 01:35:02.023]  I understand, but USA Today, there's the headline right there.
[01:35:02.043 --> 01:35:07.105]  30 year old man, evicted by his parents, I'm not a crazy person.
[01:35:07.125 --> 01:35:10.325]  You know, I watch, you speak at the court, I don't think you're crazy.
[01:35:10.465 --> 01:35:10.685]  Right.
[01:35:11.446 --> 01:35:15.847]  I think you're a little quirky, but everybody's a little quirky in ways.
[01:35:16.527 --> 01:35:18.847]  And it's easy to get you on here and be mean to you.
[01:35:19.087 --> 01:35:19.288]  Right.
[01:35:19.428 --> 01:35:20.868]  And say, you know, that
[01:35:21.820 --> 01:35:22.921]  You're a 30 year old bum.
[01:35:38.004 --> 01:35:47.174]  Again, make the citizens pay for illegal aliens health care and abortions and things like that and illegal aliens out in California wanting free health care and anchor babies.
[01:35:47.515 --> 01:35:55.804]  And my whole issue is we're told these are wonderful, perfect angels, but then the very same liberal media piled on some of the conservative media.
[01:35:56.565 --> 01:36:14.468]  And calls you a bum, and a joke, and a slob, and a delusional idiot, and all these things, which if that's true, that makes all of us even bigger morons to then at the same time, like 1984, hold it in our mind that all these other people are entitled to free stuff.
[01:36:16.389 --> 01:36:23.150]  I think that you shouldn't have people who need things like food and shelter in your own communities.
[01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:24.430]  I don't think it's something that you want.
[01:36:27.236 --> 01:36:28.477]  I'm just saying, just look at the red light, yeah.
[01:36:29.097 --> 01:36:29.598]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:36:29.618 --> 01:36:30.618]  Doing great.
[01:36:30.739 --> 01:36:32.340]  Yeah, I don't think it's a good thing to have.
[01:36:32.380 --> 01:36:46.930]  I don't think that even if it costs more, even if you have to raise taxes to get these people food and housing, I don't think it's something that you would wish to forgo because then you have hungry people and crime's going to go up.
[01:36:48.422 --> 01:36:49.743]  Isn't that going to contribute to crime, don't you think?
[01:36:49.943 --> 01:36:54.428]  That's one of the historically more reasonable arguments to that equation.
[01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:56.169]  So, you know, nobody wants that.
[01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:57.591]  Nobody wants crime.
[01:36:57.631 --> 01:37:10.002]  No one wants to have to use a firearm and then have themselves get attacked by the liberal media from that and then start the whole, you know, take the guns away type argument, which is not the problem.
[01:37:10.743 --> 01:37:12.505]  And you're calling yourself a conservative.
[01:37:14.172 --> 01:37:18.155]  I have some very conservative views.
[01:37:18.275 --> 01:37:27.021]  I have a lot of very liberal views, but I think that the Founding Fathers had it right when they wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[01:37:27.041 --> 01:37:36.627]  I think that if we were following it, I think that both of the ideals of conservatives and liberals could be accommodated.
[01:37:36.647 --> 01:37:38.128]  Well, Michael, here's the bottom line.
[01:37:38.448 --> 01:37:39.609]  I can't get on a high horse.
[01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:48.961]  And say you're the worst person, when it comes to the whole welfare society out there, when on a scale of 1 to 10, you're about a 3 or a 4.
[01:37:49.041 --> 01:37:55.423]  Because one of the most natural ways for people to turn into dependents, and to go down this road you're on, is with their parents.
[01:37:56.323 --> 01:37:58.243]  And in a lot of cultures, you know, that happens.
[01:37:58.263 --> 01:38:06.766]  Their families live in big houses together, but they all go out and work in the fields together, or work in the factories, and it's more of a communal, you know, situation, like the Waltons or something.
[01:38:09.437 --> 01:38:12.481]  On the other side of the equation though, what about your parents?
[01:38:13.783 --> 01:38:16.507]  If you don't have a job, what about them?
[01:38:16.567 --> 01:38:22.795]  They become your slave if they've got to pay for the food, the electricity, the house, the transportation.
[01:38:24.279 --> 01:38:25.761]  I would guess the medicine.
[01:38:25.781 --> 01:38:27.382]  I mean, what about them?
[01:38:27.502 --> 01:38:28.383]  What are you going to do?
[01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:29.685]  A, that's one question.
[01:38:30.005 --> 01:38:34.449]  B, what are you going to do when your parents can no longer pay for anything?
[01:38:34.489 --> 01:38:39.294]  What are you going to do when they have to go to the nursing home or God forbid, you know, have a stroke or heart attack or die?
[01:38:40.888 --> 01:38:58.155]  Um, I've been trying to leave the home, uh, for years, and it's as a result of that, that, um, I felt as though I would be able to in about three months from now, which was the, the case, well, the case I made was for six months, because that was what... So, so you agree it's a form of slavery to make them take care of you?
[01:38:59.136 --> 01:39:02.017]  To make, yeah, I don't want to make them take care of me.
[01:39:03.164 --> 01:39:04.486]  But they've been trying to get you out for six years.
[01:39:05.146 --> 01:39:05.286]  No.
[01:39:05.947 --> 01:39:06.628]  Where is that coming from?
[01:39:06.708 --> 01:39:07.388]  I saw that on the news.
[01:39:07.429 --> 01:39:07.949]  Is that not right?
[01:39:08.089 --> 01:39:08.630]  That's not right.
[01:39:09.511 --> 01:39:10.392]  Do you have that handy?
[01:39:11.373 --> 01:39:15.196]  On the news said that you lost your job eight years ago, six years ago, that they've been trying to get you out for years.
[01:39:15.216 --> 01:39:16.338]  Is that not true?
[01:39:16.618 --> 01:39:16.798]  No.
[01:39:16.938 --> 01:39:17.539]  First part's true.
[01:39:17.559 --> 01:39:18.079]  Second part's false.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:27.503]  So, I've been there for eight years, but they've only tried to get me out since October of this past year.
[01:39:28.623 --> 01:39:34.665]  My first hearing of their decision for me to leave was the February 2nd notice.
[01:39:35.246 --> 01:39:35.406]  Sure.
[01:39:36.326 --> 01:39:51.999]  Well, I did think the media made this all one-dimensional to make fun of you and to laugh at you, and I also said some, you know, derogatory things that I've said to your face here, just being honest with you, because I want to have a man-to-man talk with you on air and off air.
[01:39:53.220 --> 01:40:00.326]  I'm tempted to offer you a job as a reporter, and even get you a crew.
[01:40:01.232 --> 01:40:01.792]  Okay.
[01:40:02.012 --> 01:40:06.014]  In New York, but you'd have to actually go out and do the shoots and do the reports.
[01:40:06.034 --> 01:40:16.538]  You know, Howard Stern hired some interesting people and I think, you call yourself a conservative, I think we could, I'll just say it, we could turn you into a
[01:40:18.134 --> 01:40:18.915]  Formidable individual.
[01:40:18.935 --> 01:40:20.577]  But we're going to have to have some discussions.
[01:40:21.278 --> 01:40:21.598]  All right.
[01:40:21.998 --> 01:40:24.441]  Now that's New York City or New York State?
[01:40:24.741 --> 01:40:26.584]  But see, you may have to go where we want you to go.
[01:40:26.604 --> 01:40:28.726]  That's part of being... taking care of yourself.
[01:40:29.347 --> 01:40:32.370]  Well... Because you have to make compromises with your employers or other people.
[01:40:33.551 --> 01:40:34.633]  I just want to be able to see my son.
[01:40:34.653 --> 01:40:35.914]  I understand.
[01:40:36.395 --> 01:40:36.535]  Right.
[01:40:38.334 --> 01:40:51.277]  So sure, that's how the discussion happens, but regardless, I've got a check here for you when we come back for coming down here, and I want to try to just explain a few things to you, which you sound like a smart guy in certain aspects.
[01:40:52.217 --> 01:40:54.757]  It is slavery if your parents don't take care of you.
[01:40:57.078 --> 01:40:58.578]  Someday they won't be able to take care of you.
[01:41:00.919 --> 01:41:06.060]  You're going to be more empowered in your life if you go out through a daily process
[01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:09.171]  And go through trials and tribulations.
[01:41:09.191 --> 01:41:12.893]  You know, if they try to grow plants in zero gravity... If I'm managed, is what you're saying.
[01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:16.756]  Well, but I mean, plants don't grow well in zero gravity.
[01:41:17.416 --> 01:41:17.776]  That's right.
[01:41:18.597 --> 01:41:25.480]  You understand on a Mars mission, on a one-year Mars mission just to get there, you would have trouble walking even if you were in really great shape once you got there.
[01:41:26.221 --> 01:41:28.522]  I know, I would not characterize myself as a plant.
[01:41:29.823 --> 01:41:31.264]  But no, I'm explaining something to you.
[01:41:34.076 --> 01:41:38.458]  If you don't go out and work and live your life and go through stress, you don't become strong.
[01:41:38.779 --> 01:41:39.199]  That's right.
[01:41:39.239 --> 01:41:44.302]  Your brain falls apart and you become sedentary and have Alzheimer's-type effects by even age 30.
[01:41:44.502 --> 01:41:45.763]  Right, okay.
[01:41:46.403 --> 01:41:49.344]  And I've run into kids that play with phones and TVs all day.
[01:41:49.605 --> 01:41:51.145]  They have that same look in their eye that you do.
[01:41:51.466 --> 01:41:55.368]  There's an intelligence there, but you are in kind of a mesmerized, trance state.
[01:41:55.628 --> 01:41:57.089]  You don't have a drive state going.
[01:41:57.909 --> 01:41:59.130]  My head's in the clouds is what you're saying?
[01:41:59.150 --> 01:41:59.910]  Your head's in the clouds.
[01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.270]  Okay.
[01:42:00.851 --> 01:42:02.692]  And you're smart, but you're not
[01:42:04.249 --> 01:42:05.150]  Not completely.
[01:42:05.210 --> 01:42:05.731]  Productive.
[01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:06.251]  Conscious.
[01:42:06.772 --> 01:42:07.112]  Okay.
[01:42:07.412 --> 01:42:08.433]  And it's beyond a laziness.
[01:42:08.994 --> 01:42:09.674]  It's a spirit.
[01:42:09.715 --> 01:42:10.295]  It's a program.
[01:42:10.716 --> 01:42:12.577]  How much TV and video games do you play and watch?
[01:42:14.359 --> 01:42:14.800]  Very little.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.543]  I don't do any video games except I've been doing video games a long time ago.
[01:42:20.265 --> 01:42:21.586]  The television...
[01:42:23.057 --> 01:42:25.920]  I try to watch television because I need to stop.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.303]  I need to have some time where I stop working so that I can sleep.
[01:42:29.483 --> 01:42:31.385]  I need to have some... When are you working?
[01:42:31.445 --> 01:42:33.026]  I work all day, every day almost.
[01:42:33.687 --> 01:42:33.967]  On what?
[01:42:34.567 --> 01:42:34.828]  Law.
[01:42:36.269 --> 01:42:37.049]  I have a business.
[01:42:37.069 --> 01:42:38.911]  You have a business?
[01:42:38.931 --> 01:42:39.532]  Yeah, I have a business.
[01:42:39.952 --> 01:42:41.433]  Well then why don't you move out of your parents' house?
[01:42:42.594 --> 01:42:43.315]  I'm going to move out.
[01:42:44.316 --> 01:42:46.678]  I expect to be able to... Let me ask you a question when we come back.
[01:42:46.818 --> 01:42:47.078]  Alright.
[01:42:47.158 --> 01:42:48.980]  I got key questions for you when we come back.
[01:42:50.267 --> 01:42:51.749]  We're going to discuss this straight ahead.
[01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:55.654]  We have him here, the 30-year-old evicted, about to be evicted.
[01:42:55.674 --> 01:42:56.876]  I want to find out if he's actually left yet.
[01:42:57.336 --> 01:43:00.961]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:43:06.485 --> 01:43:12.007]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:43:12.207 --> 01:43:19.849]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:43:20.089 --> 01:43:23.230]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:28.533]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:43:28.693 --> 01:43:31.235]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:43:31.475 --> 01:43:40.440]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:52.246]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pal Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[01:43:52.486 --> 01:43:57.188]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:57.288 --> 01:43:58.949]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:03.140 --> 01:44:03.881]  I'm so excited.
[01:44:03.961 --> 01:44:13.507]  The new product at Infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:14.107 --> 01:44:19.271]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:19.611 --> 01:44:22.413]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:44:22.613 --> 01:44:31.379]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:38.263]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:38.804 --> 01:44:41.565]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:41.706 --> 01:44:52.573]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:53.093 --> 01:44:54.374]  It is amazing!
[01:44:55.775 --> 01:45:00.738]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:45:02.403 --> 01:45:05.046]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[01:45:05.466 --> 01:45:10.612]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[01:45:11.272 --> 01:45:14.215]  This is the essence of InfoWars.

[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:28.348]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:30.590]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:35.675]  Michael Rotondo, one of the biggest stories in the country.
[01:47:35.695 --> 01:47:36.455]  30 year old.
[01:47:38.769 --> 01:47:43.514]  Taking his parents to court because they're trying to kick him out of the house and he wants more time.
[01:47:43.534 --> 01:47:47.498]  We're gonna find out if he's actually out now because I guess it was like two days ago the judge ruled this.
[01:47:47.518 --> 01:47:52.504]  He's here with us in Austin, Texas in studio and look this is how capitalism works my friend.
[01:47:53.345 --> 01:47:56.808]  I said I will pay you a thousand dollars just to come on.
[01:47:57.890 --> 01:48:03.155]  Just so you get a little bit of money and hopefully learn how to make your own money and go out and be free and have your own wife, your own life.
[01:48:03.175 --> 01:48:03.996]  I know you've been married before.
[01:48:04.016 --> 01:48:05.257]  I've been married before.
[01:48:05.597 --> 01:48:06.358]  Or have a child.
[01:48:06.638 --> 01:48:06.798]  Right.
[01:48:06.898 --> 01:48:12.744]  The point is, is that here's $3,000 my friend so that you can hopefully get on your own feet.
[01:48:13.024 --> 01:48:17.148]  I can and this means a lot to me and you're keeping me off the street with this.
[01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:18.549]  Well listen.
[01:48:18.569 --> 01:48:19.069]  I appreciate it.
[01:48:19.630 --> 01:48:20.551]  I can't sit here and
[01:48:22.816 --> 01:48:25.498]  You know, just put you down and call you names.
[01:48:25.518 --> 01:48:36.345]  And I've said a few smart mouth things, but again, what I'm getting at here is the globalists, the social engineers, they want to make us all dependent.
[01:48:36.405 --> 01:48:52.195]  They've set up a culture and a system that is trying to arrest our development and that is electronically programming our brains to put us into a type of artificial Asperger's type state, but not an Asperger's state where people are even able to carry out tasks.
[01:48:53.985 --> 01:48:59.129]  It's a spectrum and it's electromagnetic and it's mainstream news now that this is happening.
[01:48:59.589 --> 01:49:03.632]  And our embassy staff are getting hit with it at amped up rates.
[01:49:04.533 --> 01:49:10.378]  Cell phone radiation is causing heart problems, brain damage, doubling brain tumors just with the old 3 and 4G.
[01:49:11.518 --> 01:49:12.939]  And so what I'm telling you is
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:19.948]  I can't sit here and judge you wanting to be with your parents, having some type of, you know, psychological, you know, baby thing where you don't want to leave.
[01:49:20.088 --> 01:49:21.510]  I can't analyze the whole deal.
[01:49:21.810 --> 01:49:25.034]  But I'm telling you, this won't go well for you down the road.
[01:49:26.184 --> 01:49:33.187]  If you continue to not make yourself go out and live on your own and reach out.
[01:49:33.207 --> 01:49:44.932]  You know, just the idea of doing everything kind of OCD, you know, in exact little ways the way you want to get it done, and then people catering to that is going to put you into a smaller and smaller box, in my view.
[01:49:44.992 --> 01:49:46.613]  I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist.
[01:49:46.893 --> 01:49:48.234]  I'm just a student on the street in life.
[01:49:48.534 --> 01:49:54.777]  So I wanted to actually humanize you, but also tell you I think your parents are doing the right thing, giving you a swift kick in the old ass.
[01:49:57.074 --> 01:49:59.075]  Uh, that would be, that would be reasonable.
[01:49:59.156 --> 01:50:07.361]  I think, um, I would say that maybe they should have served me a six-month notice to quit and, uh, then I'd be out in six months and they wouldn't have had to pay a penny in legal fees.
[01:50:07.921 --> 01:50:18.048]  And, uh, I'd be out just as you had, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:21.581]  Professors and people saying, oh, you have a right to stay.
[01:50:22.141 --> 01:50:25.203]  Well, then do I have a right to just go knock on somebody's door and say they're going to take care of me?
[01:50:25.683 --> 01:50:27.465]  This idea, take care of me, take care of me.
[01:50:27.485 --> 01:50:31.307]  You know what happens at the park if you feed the squirrels and you feed the wildlife?
[01:50:31.327 --> 01:50:34.349]  They become obese, greedy, hateful and stupid.
[01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:35.830]  And that's what they say.
[01:50:35.850 --> 01:50:37.972]  They don't don't feed the animals at the park.
[01:50:38.692 --> 01:50:40.654]  Here's where that opinion may come from.
[01:50:41.155 --> 01:50:52.408]  The February 2nd notice was a threat to basically commit a crime according to the real property law of New York State, where you cannot all of a sudden lock someone out without a court proceeding.
[01:50:53.109 --> 01:50:57.755]  So that may be taken from that where it's believed that you go to the court,
[01:50:58.295 --> 01:51:14.717]  I would say what I said to the judge which is that you know this was this notice is against the law and they were threatening to commit a crime and it was harassment and the judge could respond to that by penalizing my parents and saying listen you know I'm... But they left you five notices and even offered cash to help you get your new home.
[01:51:15.586 --> 01:51:19.669]  Right, but that doesn't change the fact that it requires about six months to make it so you can support it.
[01:51:19.689 --> 01:51:30.198]  Listen, bottom line, do parents, when their child is, I think, biologically twice the age passed when they should be out of the house, do they keep arresting development more and more and more?
[01:51:30.838 --> 01:51:42.367]  I mean, you know, like you read Wagon Wheels, which is based on a true story, you know, it's like former slave family and they got their little seven, eight, nine-year-olds marching a hundred miles with a map that daddy drew to say, meet me there.
[01:51:42.427 --> 01:51:43.027]  They made it there.
[01:51:43.307 --> 01:51:45.149]  I read stuff about my frontier families and stuff.
[01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:46.190]  It was the same kind of stuff.
[01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:51.594]  I mean, you have people skinning bucks, running trot lines when they were 10 years old and now look at us.
[01:51:51.894 --> 01:51:53.335]  They're saying the new 18 is 35.
[01:51:53.835 --> 01:51:56.417]  I'm sure you've seen those headlines where there's this whole culture.
[01:51:56.557 --> 01:51:58.359]  Austin is filled with people like you.
[01:51:58.519 --> 01:51:58.759]  Really?
[01:51:58.999 --> 01:52:00.241]  Yeah, but they just live off welfare.
[01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:01.262]  They work one day a week.
[01:52:01.543 --> 01:52:02.444]  It's their religion.
[01:52:02.845 --> 01:52:07.752]  But then they think, I've got to pay more taxes so that they can, you know, sit around and smoke dope all day.
[01:52:09.246 --> 01:52:16.731]  Well, one thing I have to say in response to that is that I think that it's important that people, um, are trying to, you know, to grow themselves.
[01:52:16.931 --> 01:52:19.313]  And it sounds like these people you're describing are not trying to do that.
[01:52:19.973 --> 01:52:25.117]  And, uh, from that, there would be more opportunity because there'd be more businesses.
[01:52:25.257 --> 01:52:34.363]  So I, I, you know, and it talks about, it speaks to what you were saying before about how people are sort of brought into this sedentary, uh, lifestyle, uh, where they just... Yeah, and I'm saying you're really common.
[01:52:34.403 --> 01:52:36.905]  You're not this, this... I'm not that.
[01:52:37.728 --> 01:52:42.750]  Well, I'm saying what we're discussing here is super garden variety.
[01:52:42.850 --> 01:52:43.610]  It's the trend.
[01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:44.210]  Okay.
[01:52:44.250 --> 01:52:45.270]  It's not the exception.
[01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:46.171]  It's the trend.
[01:52:46.291 --> 01:52:46.531]  Okay.
[01:52:46.571 --> 01:52:47.171]  It's growing.
[01:52:47.211 --> 01:52:49.952]  And most people that are like this act just like you.
[01:52:49.972 --> 01:52:51.152]  They're usually witty in ways.
[01:52:51.352 --> 01:52:51.772]  They're smart.
[01:52:51.792 --> 01:52:52.633]  They have little comebacks.
[01:52:52.853 --> 01:52:54.373]  They have all the little ways of doing things.
[01:52:54.653 --> 01:52:56.494]  And I think it's a gross form of selfishness.
[01:52:56.574 --> 01:52:57.494]  You're calling me a millennial?
[01:52:58.895 --> 01:52:59.715]  Well, you are.
[01:52:59.735 --> 01:53:00.335]  All right.
[01:53:01.615 --> 01:53:02.256]  I am a millennial.
[01:53:02.416 --> 01:53:03.036]  I will admit that.
[01:53:03.696 --> 01:53:06.557]  But what is it with millennials?
[01:53:07.895 --> 01:53:14.036]  I mean, I'm not bragging, bro, but when I was 11, I was... I'm not gonna even get into it all.
[01:53:14.516 --> 01:53:15.756]  The point is... I'll tell both ways.
[01:53:16.496 --> 01:53:21.597]  Well, by the time I was 12, I was, by all intents and purposes, had done the things men do.
[01:53:22.237 --> 01:53:22.477]  Okay?
[01:53:22.497 --> 01:53:28.238]  Been in a bunch of fights, already been with women, whole nine yards, looked like I was 16 when I was 16, looked like I was 20-something.
[01:53:28.558 --> 01:53:31.359]  I was 21 already on the radio, 22 syndicated, I'm 44 now.
[01:53:31.399 --> 01:53:33.219]  I'm not staying on that grade of a person.
[01:53:33.619 --> 01:53:36.600]  My dad was going in apprenticeships in factories and stuff when he was 10.
[01:53:39.048 --> 01:53:52.322]  His great-uncle ran away from home when he was 11 and jumped on a steamboat and went to China and all around the world and came back and then was one of the biggest runners of liquor in Houston.
[01:53:52.422 --> 01:53:55.706]  Take Shane Steiner, my buddy's great-grandfather who died at like 102.
[01:53:55.746 --> 01:53:56.026]  Buck Steiner.
[01:53:58.008 --> 01:53:59.809]  He ran the Dixie Mafia in Texas.
[01:54:00.269 --> 01:54:00.630]  Okay.
[01:54:00.650 --> 01:54:01.350]  The whole nine yards.
[01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:02.050]  Is that a good thing?
[01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:03.351]  By the time he was like 30 years old.
[01:54:03.611 --> 01:54:03.791]  Alright.
[01:54:03.831 --> 01:54:06.713]  But I'm just saying, man, how do people become like this?
[01:54:06.753 --> 01:54:08.914]  How do you not want to go out and do something?
[01:54:09.254 --> 01:54:13.096]  Is that your uncle hopped on the train and went off that way?
[01:54:13.116 --> 01:54:13.996]  No, my dad's great uncle.
[01:54:14.016 --> 01:54:14.737]  Your dad's great uncle.
[01:54:14.757 --> 01:54:16.037]  I'm saying they were all like that.
[01:54:16.558 --> 01:54:20.460]  Right, because they felt... They're like 11 years old in the middle of the countryside in East Texas.
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:21.100]  I'm gone.
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:22.441]  They were raised to be capable.
[01:54:22.981 --> 01:54:23.221]  Yeah.
[01:54:23.901 --> 01:54:24.622]  Not like today.
[01:54:25.702 --> 01:54:27.123]  Okay, so how were you raised?
[01:54:30.859 --> 01:54:33.921]  I wouldn't really characterize myself as having been raised necessarily.
[01:54:34.201 --> 01:54:38.724]  It was more or less I had to fend for myself in a lot of ways in that environment.
[01:54:39.124 --> 01:54:40.625]  Fend for yourself in your parents' house?
[01:54:40.845 --> 01:54:41.766]  Did your parents abuse you?
[01:54:44.241 --> 01:54:45.782]  I'm not responding to that right now.
[01:54:46.002 --> 01:54:50.024]  But I would say that I had to figure out things for myself.
[01:54:50.044 --> 01:54:53.525]  If I wanted to achieve something, I had to figure out how I was or was not going.
[01:54:53.545 --> 01:54:54.365]  Were you a latchkey kid?
[01:54:54.385 --> 01:54:55.626]  I don't know what that means.
[01:54:56.086 --> 01:54:58.207]  Did your parents leave you at home all day by yourself?
[01:54:59.728 --> 01:55:02.849]  I was on my own most of the day.
[01:55:02.869 --> 01:55:04.810]  Let me ask you this question real quick because we appreciate you being here.
[01:55:05.010 --> 01:55:05.230]  Sure.
[01:55:07.611 --> 01:55:10.092]  How are you doing right now?
[01:55:10.132 --> 01:55:11.333]  Are you still at home with your parents?
[01:55:11.733 --> 01:55:11.873]  Yeah.
[01:55:13.041 --> 01:55:15.462]  Tell us about that.
[01:55:15.622 --> 01:55:16.022]  It's weird.
[01:55:17.082 --> 01:55:20.083]  There was only two instances.
[01:55:20.123 --> 01:55:23.584]  It was basically normal, but people have been asking me questions, and I realize it's a little different.
[01:55:23.724 --> 01:55:28.885]  My father, the day of the judgment, came down.
[01:55:28.905 --> 01:55:39.148]  I was in the house, I was in the kitchen at the same time as they were, and my father and I tried to occupy the same space at the same time, and I said, excuse me, because I was just being, you know,
[01:55:40.017 --> 01:55:41.779]  Reasonable person, just you know.
[01:55:41.919 --> 01:55:43.300]  And he said, no Michael, I will not excuse you.
[01:55:44.301 --> 01:55:45.822]  And I just, I didn't say anything.
[01:55:45.862 --> 01:55:48.905]  And I think to myself, what was he trying to achieve with that?
[01:55:48.925 --> 01:55:49.665]  What was that for?
[01:55:50.326 --> 01:55:54.950]  And from that, that was new.
[01:55:55.791 --> 01:56:00.294]  It was new for there to be a sort of a line in the sand all of a sudden.
[01:56:01.015 --> 01:56:03.277]  Wow, so your parents got a little cold with you.
[01:56:04.378 --> 01:56:06.700]  I would say provocative of a confrontation.
[01:56:08.168 --> 01:56:11.190]  Well, when you start getting old, you really want to do things the way you want to do them.
[01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:14.733]  If I was 60-something years old, how old are your parents?
[01:56:14.753 --> 01:56:15.613]  60-something years old, 61.
[01:56:16.074 --> 01:56:19.976]  I mean, and I had a son going around that was dressed like Cousin It.
[01:56:20.717 --> 01:56:22.618]  I'd get pissed off and tell him, get the hell out of the house.
[01:56:26.581 --> 01:56:27.382]  I can't wait to get out of there.
[01:56:28.302 --> 01:56:29.463]  And by the way, I like your beard and hair.
[01:56:29.483 --> 01:56:31.164]  I was just doing a cheap shot there.
[01:56:31.565 --> 01:56:33.906]  I look like a pumpkin head, so it's alright.
[01:56:37.577 --> 01:56:39.080]  Anyways, my wife says I do.
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:39.721]  I don't think so.
[01:56:40.201 --> 01:56:41.303]  Hey, but seriously, seriously.
[01:56:44.188 --> 01:56:45.190]  When are you going to get out now?
[01:56:46.392 --> 01:56:57.439]  I, um, I'm considering that I can have, well it depends on how many hands I have to help me because I've had some people offer to help me, but it's basically getting my stuff to, uh... Well, you just got $3,000.
[01:56:57.479 --> 01:57:04.723]  Yeah, I gotta get these things out of there and put them in another place and then, uh... But $3,000, you can't have that much stuff.
[01:57:04.743 --> 01:57:07.805]  We're talking, you know, $300, $400 a moving company?
[01:57:09.706 --> 01:57:10.146]  I'm not gonna do that.
[01:57:10.166 --> 01:57:10.787]  I'm gonna do it myself.
[01:57:12.339 --> 01:57:16.682]  See, everyone isn't operating on your timetable, bro!
[01:57:17.082 --> 01:57:18.383]  I have until January 1st.
[01:57:18.403 --> 01:57:19.464]  You're telling me I gotta get up sooner?
[01:57:19.484 --> 01:57:21.545]  Or, uh, June.
[01:57:21.625 --> 01:57:21.986]  June 1st.
[01:57:22.866 --> 01:57:23.367]  June 1st?
[01:57:23.527 --> 01:57:23.707]  Yeah.
[01:57:24.247 --> 01:57:26.689]  I'm gonna just try to put your email out or something.
[01:57:26.729 --> 01:57:27.730]  Maybe our listeners want to help you.
[01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:28.670]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:28.690 --> 01:57:28.910]  No, no, no.
[01:57:28.930 --> 01:57:29.951]  I mean, help you move your stuff.
[01:57:29.971 --> 01:57:31.172]  Don't put my email out.
[01:57:31.192 --> 01:57:32.953]  There might be a girl out there that thinks you're pretty handsome.
[01:57:33.553 --> 01:57:34.094]  That's not gonna help me.
[01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:42.337]  Hey, folks, we got free shipping on all the big top items.
[01:57:42.357 --> 01:57:47.304]  50% off on a bunch of the new bestsellers, including the Real Red Pill Plus, now with enhanced energy.
[01:57:47.785 --> 01:57:49.829]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com.
[01:57:50.429 --> 01:57:51.131]  I need your support.
[01:57:53.060 --> 01:58:00.905]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:01.305 --> 01:58:08.911]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:58:09.271 --> 01:58:13.554]  CNN and many others are calling for Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:58:13.914 --> 01:58:16.096]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying,
[01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:17.837]  Go beyond censorship.
[01:58:18.037 --> 01:58:20.840]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:25.424]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:58:26.285 --> 01:58:29.328]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:58:30.268 --> 01:58:35.333]  That's why it's more important than ever that folks stay in contact with InfoWars.
[01:58:35.633 --> 01:58:41.839]  If you sign up for our free newsletter that goes out daily at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter

[01:58:54.037 --> 01:58:54.717]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:58:55.197 --> 01:58:59.680]  And we've got backups, so that we have that personal, direct relationship with you.
[01:59:00.380 --> 01:59:07.084]  I was never good about email and, you know, collecting folks' email like everybody else does because I was always going for the latest cutting-edge stuff.
[01:59:07.124 --> 01:59:07.725]  We still do that.
[01:59:08.125 --> 01:59:12.127]  But all the experts have told me, Alex, if they shut everything down, it gets really bad.
[01:59:12.628 --> 01:59:21.713]  You've got to have a thumb drive with those emails so you can contact the base core of patriots that understand what's happening, the real remnant.
[01:59:22.273 --> 01:59:26.896]  Now, we're hoping for the best, ladies and gentlemen, but we're also preparing for the worst.
[01:59:27.136 --> 01:59:29.738]  That's why it's so critical, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:59:29.838 --> 01:59:43.702]  Let you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:43.942 --> 01:59:45.222]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:45.462 --> 01:59:51.684]  So please sign up for the free newsletter today and then share the emails with everyone you know to cause a chain reaction.
[01:59:54.372 --> 01:59:58.475]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:58.995 --> 02:00:00.336]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:06.259 --> 02:00:09.361]  News, analysis, reports.
[02:00:10.122 --> 02:00:12.403]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:12.703 --> 02:00:18.187]  Well, I think Michael Rotondo is eccentric.
[02:00:18.247 --> 02:00:23.030]  That was the old word they had for smart people that are quirky and a little weird.
[02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:32.897]  And of course, I've now been talking to him during the breaks, and he told me about his interest, and I have to tell you, my friends, it is Asperger's-type spectrum classic things.
[02:00:33.317 --> 02:00:41.223]  And you were telling me you like machines, you like numbers, you like engineering, you like just to watch machines for hours on YouTube every day, and that's fine.
[02:00:41.263 --> 02:00:48.029]  That's actually, I think, a form of advanced intelligence, but if people don't know how to shuttle you into the thing you need to be doing, then you'll just kind of spin your wheels forever.
[02:00:48.669 --> 02:00:50.609]  Because there's some people that are virtuosos with music.
[02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:52.790]  Some people are virtuosos with physical prowess.
[02:00:52.810 --> 02:00:55.030]  Some people are virtuosos when it comes to oratory.
[02:00:55.330 --> 02:00:57.391]  Some people are virtuosos when it comes to being psychic.
[02:00:58.151 --> 02:00:58.611]  You understand?
[02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:03.712]  But then there's other people that are just, their brains kind of get caught in the little technical minutiae of things.
[02:01:03.992 --> 02:01:04.652]  Which is fine.
[02:01:04.853 --> 02:01:05.733]  There's jobs for that.
[02:01:06.013 --> 02:01:06.973]  And there's fulfillment for that.
[02:01:08.033 --> 02:01:10.954]  You're saying I'm an employable person is what you're saying?
[02:01:13.594 --> 02:01:15.915]  Well, repeat what you told me earlier, what you like to do.
[02:01:16.823 --> 02:01:19.305]  I like to go on YouTube, I like to watch machinery.
[02:01:19.325 --> 02:01:32.695]  I like to watch, excuse me, what I'm watching is I'm watching what the engineers have designed and engineered and built to be efficient and functional and productive.
[02:01:32.995 --> 02:01:38.900]  Okay, then have you gone out and gotten, you know, the models and things and then built your own things or modified them?
[02:01:40.381 --> 02:01:41.221]  I've done some things like that.
[02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:44.144]  Okay, well, why don't you then go to
[02:01:45.526 --> 02:01:49.309]  Like radio, television, electronics, you know, type schools.
[02:01:49.349 --> 02:01:49.970]  They have those.
[02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:52.652]  A lot of those places actually can get you really good jobs.
[02:01:53.252 --> 02:01:54.253]  You'll meet a bunch of people like you.
[02:01:55.314 --> 02:01:57.476]  That's too monotonous.
[02:01:57.496 --> 02:01:58.236]  I like working with people.
[02:01:59.017 --> 02:02:00.478]  Well, no, there are going to be people involved.
[02:02:00.518 --> 02:02:03.421]  That's the whole point.
[02:02:05.842 --> 02:02:08.645]  I don't think I could do engineering in an office all day.
[02:02:09.557 --> 02:02:10.497]  I could do design.
[02:02:10.517 --> 02:02:15.698]  Hey, Pizzeria Chain offers job to 30-year-old New York man evicted by parents.
[02:02:16.038 --> 02:02:17.258]  Can you send me that link?
[02:02:17.278 --> 02:02:19.019]  Because I had someone refer me to that today.
[02:02:19.039 --> 02:02:21.299]  They haven't connected me to her.
[02:02:21.319 --> 02:02:33.582]  That's nice of them to offer you a job, but at the same time, you don't want a job as somebody doing technical work without the degree in engineering?
[02:02:38.052 --> 02:02:38.572]  Probably not.
[02:02:39.533 --> 02:02:39.933]  It depends.
[02:02:39.973 --> 02:02:43.715]  I mean, I really... It depends what exactly the job description is.
[02:02:43.735 --> 02:02:45.556]  I mean, there's engineers, there's people who design.
[02:02:45.576 --> 02:02:46.496]  Do you have any friends?
[02:02:47.997 --> 02:02:48.217]  Sort of.
[02:02:48.897 --> 02:02:49.417]  Not close friends.
[02:02:49.437 --> 02:02:50.198]  I don't really have any close friends.
[02:02:51.879 --> 02:02:52.679]  You have to get out, though.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:54.420]  Of the house?
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.221]  Just, you need to go out and get out of the house.
[02:02:57.301 --> 02:02:57.561]  Yes.
[02:02:58.021 --> 02:02:58.742]  I need to socialize.
[02:02:58.882 --> 02:02:59.142]  Yes.
[02:02:59.902 --> 02:03:02.924]  Your parents are trying... See, there's always been people like you.
[02:03:03.104 --> 02:03:03.744]  You're a good guy.
[02:03:03.924 --> 02:03:04.184]  Alright.
[02:03:04.204 --> 02:03:05.425]  There's all different types of people.
[02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:13.711]  The internet and computers are allowing people to plug into this virtual reality and every metric and every statistic says it's destroying people.
[02:03:14.151 --> 02:03:16.693]  Netflix is making the population growth rate go down.
[02:03:17.994 --> 02:03:19.715]  People aren't having sex because of Netflix.
[02:03:21.016 --> 02:03:22.097]  Humanity is dying.
[02:03:22.197 --> 02:03:23.358]  Our IQs are lowering.
[02:03:23.618 --> 02:03:24.799]  We're in a mesmerized state.
[02:03:24.819 --> 02:03:25.920]  You need to come out of it.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:26.400]  Come on!
[02:03:28.261 --> 02:03:29.062]  Michael, you can do it!
[02:03:29.803 --> 02:03:30.043]  Come on!
[02:03:30.763 --> 02:03:31.224]  You can do it!
[02:03:32.062 --> 02:03:34.584]  You understand, you don't have to be in this other place.
[02:03:34.844 --> 02:03:35.824]  You can be here, now.
[02:03:36.605 --> 02:03:38.566]  There's an entire universe right there waiting for you.
[02:03:41.008 --> 02:03:43.549]  Have you ever run around in the mountains at night with a full moon?
[02:03:44.190 --> 02:03:46.251]  When it's about 30 degrees out, with your shirt off?
[02:03:47.592 --> 02:03:49.373]  I've done some things like that.
[02:03:49.473 --> 02:03:50.153]  Stuff like that!
[02:03:50.213 --> 02:03:51.694]  That's how you wake up and recharge.
[02:03:52.014 --> 02:03:54.376]  You need to not just be hiding in your house.
[02:03:55.717 --> 02:03:59.759]  You've run around on mountaintops at night when there's a full moon, with your shirt off, with 30 degrees.
[02:03:59.879 --> 02:04:00.620]  Not exactly that.
[02:04:01.820 --> 02:04:02.761]  That's what I do for entertainment.
[02:04:03.301 --> 02:04:06.763]  But the point is, is that you need to do things like that.
[02:04:07.924 --> 02:04:12.587]  I need to run around like a lunatic?
[02:04:12.607 --> 02:04:12.707]  Yes.
[02:04:12.727 --> 02:04:15.549]  I don't think that's going to help my case.
[02:04:17.290 --> 02:04:19.532]  But you know, it is Luna, lunatic, lunacy.
[02:04:20.072 --> 02:04:20.372]  Really?
[02:04:20.392 --> 02:04:22.614]  See, you've been programmed by the modern system.
[02:04:22.674 --> 02:04:23.995]  You need the real lunacy.
[02:04:24.255 --> 02:04:27.297]  Gee, I'm crazy, so I can't go nuts.
[02:04:30.313 --> 02:04:30.893]  I guess.
[02:04:30.953 --> 02:04:31.694]  You need to go.
[02:04:31.714 --> 02:04:32.854]  I'm serious.
[02:04:32.895 --> 02:04:38.258]  You need to break out of those little norms, those little areas, those little back eddies that you're in.
[02:04:38.718 --> 02:04:40.379]  And you need to come out of it.
[02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.520]  I think that's happening.
[02:04:44.301 --> 02:04:44.841]  I think it is.
[02:04:44.861 --> 02:04:47.983]  Ridiculous photo of me.
[02:04:48.683 --> 02:04:49.044]  Anyways.
[02:04:51.673 --> 02:04:52.094]  Oh boy.
[02:04:52.295 --> 02:04:54.339]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:04:54.519 --> 02:05:00.471]  Michael Rotundo is here and he's got $3,000 and a free plane ticket down here and he's already jumping back on the plane back to New York.
[02:05:00.551 --> 02:05:01.233]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:01.253 --> 02:05:01.653]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.567 --> 02:05:09.552]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[02:05:13.155 --> 02:05:16.598]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:16.859 --> 02:05:21.122]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:21.563 --> 02:05:24.825]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:25.726 --> 02:05:35.952]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:36.712 --> 02:05:45.257]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:46.878 --> 02:05:55.425]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:06:11.187 --> 02:06:16.177]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:06:16.197 --> 02:06:17.719]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:06:22.938 --> 02:06:26.940]  This old dude is facing an eviction threat from his own parents.
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:28.621]  That's just so ridiculous.
[02:06:28.741 --> 02:06:33.523]  Michael Rotundo's mom and dad are so fed up, they're suing to get him out of the house.
[02:06:34.023 --> 02:06:36.745]  I don't see why the judge wants to throw people out on the street.
[02:06:37.105 --> 02:06:43.849]  His parents filed the extraordinary lawsuit following months of repeated attempts to get him to leave their home in Syracuse, New York.
[02:06:44.269 --> 02:06:46.450]  And the story is getting lots of attention.
[02:06:46.730 --> 02:06:50.971]  A judge asked why he didn't just move in with his girlfriend, and the man said, girlfriend?
[02:06:51.051 --> 02:06:52.872]  I'm a 30-year-old man living at home.
[02:06:52.952 --> 02:06:54.613]  Dude, there's no girlfriend.
[02:06:55.773 --> 02:06:57.594]  Michael Rotondo is here.
[02:06:57.634 --> 02:06:59.414]  But you know, something happened to you.
[02:06:59.474 --> 02:07:01.855]  You went out years ago, I guess 2022.
[02:07:01.995 --> 02:07:04.096]  I've got the timeline here.
[02:07:04.736 --> 02:07:07.857]  You had a baby with a woman.
[02:07:07.877 --> 02:07:08.797]  It's your child.
[02:07:08.817 --> 02:07:09.458]  Boy or girl?
[02:07:09.718 --> 02:07:09.938]  Boy.
[02:07:11.238 --> 02:07:12.539]  And how old is your son?
[02:07:12.859 --> 02:07:13.119]  He's eight.
[02:07:14.312 --> 02:07:24.479]  Well, he needs you, and he needs you in case something happened to the mom or whatever, you know, to be self-sufficient, so that you can take care of him until he's 18.
[02:07:26.341 --> 02:07:29.663]  Well, I would actually support him until he found something that suited him.
[02:07:32.385 --> 02:07:34.787]  But what if something never suits you?
[02:07:35.387 --> 02:07:36.068]  That's a good question.
[02:07:36.108 --> 02:07:43.033]  I thought about that, and I thought that, um... You know, Donald Trump had some pretty wives before.
[02:07:44.461 --> 02:07:47.403]  Melania, though, is a whole other universe.
[02:07:48.183 --> 02:07:49.564]  But he hadn't run into Melania yet.
[02:07:49.604 --> 02:07:52.446]  Melania wasn't born yet when Trump got his first wife.
[02:07:54.627 --> 02:07:57.709]  You have to get while the getting's good, son.
[02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.530]  Okay.
[02:08:06.550 --> 02:08:12.957]  You're telling me to get, I gotta, I gotta get some kind of commitment out of a woman now while I have a chance?
[02:08:13.017 --> 02:08:14.038]  Hey, look at Owen Schroer.
[02:08:14.058 --> 02:08:15.380]  Look at the smile on Schroer.
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:16.261]  Bring him up right now.
[02:08:16.281 --> 02:08:17.602]  Can we punch that up?
[02:08:18.363 --> 02:08:20.366]  Schroer, that's a guy afraid to get out and do anything.
[02:08:21.693 --> 02:08:26.594]  Oh, and I don't want to be mean to this guy, but the media acts like he's so rare, everybody looks down their nose at it.
[02:08:26.994 --> 02:08:30.075]  This guy is the future right here on the course we are.
[02:08:30.475 --> 02:08:32.515]  And I'm trying to get money, trying to get him a job.
[02:08:33.175 --> 02:08:34.656]  I'm like, hey, you want to be a reporter for us?
[02:08:34.756 --> 02:08:35.416]  I'm serious.
[02:08:35.816 --> 02:08:39.637]  And if you just do some basic stuff and get better and better, you could be really successful with us.
[02:08:39.937 --> 02:08:41.257]  But you gotta go out and do it.
[02:08:42.837 --> 02:08:45.798]  It sounds like I could do a lot of good with...
[02:08:47.739 --> 02:08:49.921]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
[02:08:50.281 --> 02:08:51.442]  Show no mercy.
[02:08:52.963 --> 02:08:54.044]  I'm not a Star Wars fan.
[02:08:54.965 --> 02:08:55.225]  I'm not.
[02:08:55.485 --> 02:08:56.285]  I'm a Palpatine fan.
[02:08:56.526 --> 02:08:56.606]  Oh.
[02:08:58.427 --> 02:09:00.028]  You didn't know Emperor Palpatine's my spirit animal?
[02:09:00.769 --> 02:09:01.009]  No.
[02:09:01.949 --> 02:09:03.490]  They overlooked that when they were mucking me up.
[02:09:03.571 --> 02:09:05.152]  Emperor Palpatine is my co-pilot.
[02:09:06.052 --> 02:09:06.312]  Okay.
[02:09:08.274 --> 02:09:08.834]  I don't know what that is.
[02:09:08.854 --> 02:09:09.815]  Emperor Palpatine's my boyfriend.
[02:09:09.835 --> 02:09:11.336]  I thought you had a wife.
[02:09:12.748 --> 02:09:14.169]  I said my spirit, it's a joke!
[02:09:14.289 --> 02:09:15.631]  Okay!
[02:09:16.691 --> 02:09:18.273]  It's a joke, Ian McDiarmid.
[02:09:18.653 --> 02:09:19.934]  Okay, the actor, he's hilarious.
[02:09:21.976 --> 02:09:23.357]  Emperor Palpatine is a comic genius.
[02:09:24.598 --> 02:09:25.079]  You know that.
[02:09:25.899 --> 02:09:28.061]  Owen Troyer, you want to say something to this great American?
[02:09:28.101 --> 02:09:29.763]  You've got your big veteran show coming up today.
[02:09:30.185 --> 02:09:36.793]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that, and we're going to be talking about that here in just a minute in studio, but I actually had a couple questions for Michael.
[02:09:36.813 --> 02:09:40.197]  You know, we're about the same age, so I figured I could ask him a couple questions.
[02:09:40.397 --> 02:09:41.058]  How old are you, Owen?
[02:09:41.278 --> 02:09:41.659]  I'm 28.
[02:09:42.660 --> 02:09:45.363]  You've got your degree in psychology, you're a Jedi Sith Lord.
[02:09:46.224 --> 02:09:54.671]  I just want to know, because one of my, I mean, when I was younger, one of my biggest causes to want to get out of the house was so that, you know, I could have, like, a girl over.
[02:09:54.691 --> 02:09:58.594]  So I'm just curious, how do you, do you, do you even try to attempt to get women anymore?
[02:09:58.654 --> 02:09:59.394]  I was thrown out of the house!
[02:09:59.414 --> 02:10:00.855]  How do you bring women into the parents' house?
[02:10:01.236 --> 02:10:04.118]  I was thrown out of the house because my mom did not like this old girlfriend.
[02:10:04.498 --> 02:10:09.802]  And when that girlfriend, old Cindy, smart-mouthed my mom in the kitchen, my mom had me thrown out in two days.
[02:10:10.182 --> 02:10:11.744]  She said, David, get him out of here.
[02:10:12.714 --> 02:10:15.318]  So I can kind of think of her being smart-mouthed by my mom, I might still be there, huh?
[02:10:15.638 --> 02:10:16.159]  Sorry, sorry.
[02:10:16.279 --> 02:10:17.241]  Owen, ask your question again.
[02:10:17.741 --> 02:10:18.623]  I remember what it was.
[02:10:18.663 --> 02:10:19.584]  You can ask me if you want, though.
[02:10:20.726 --> 02:10:21.727]  No, so I'm just curious.
[02:10:21.767 --> 02:10:25.152]  I mean, do you even attempt to meet women anymore, or have you given up on that yet?
[02:10:25.172 --> 02:10:26.313]  Or do you bring women in the house?
[02:10:26.434 --> 02:10:27.916]  No, I don't bring anyone in the house.
[02:10:28.457 --> 02:10:28.617]  Okay.
[02:10:30.259 --> 02:10:30.679]  Is it time?
[02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:33.761]  I don't have time to fraternize with women, really.
[02:10:33.801 --> 02:10:34.661]  Okay, so, but you know what?
[02:10:34.681 --> 02:10:35.442]  You said that earlier.
[02:10:35.462 --> 02:10:38.683]  You also said that you are... Do you have a law degree?
[02:10:39.464 --> 02:10:39.664]  No.
[02:10:39.984 --> 02:10:40.304]  So what?
[02:10:40.324 --> 02:10:41.425]  You said you do legal work.
[02:10:41.445 --> 02:10:42.485]  So what legal work are you doing?
[02:10:42.605 --> 02:10:43.986]  Oh, and you've got a degree in psychology.
[02:10:44.026 --> 02:10:47.387]  Does this guy not act like he's got Asperger's with a helping of laziness?
[02:10:47.688 --> 02:10:49.909]  Well, I'm not a doctor, but... I understand, but you've got a...
[02:10:50.589 --> 02:10:51.930]  But I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't know.
[02:10:51.970 --> 02:10:53.791]  It's a nature versus a nurture argument.
[02:10:53.931 --> 02:10:55.751]  Then it doesn't seem like it's the nurture.
[02:10:55.771 --> 02:10:58.573]  So maybe it's a vaccine or the food or something.
[02:10:58.613 --> 02:10:58.913]  I don't know.
[02:10:59.033 --> 02:11:03.835]  What if you had to, if you had to pick one, if you had to say Asperger's or no, what would you pick?
[02:11:03.855 --> 02:11:11.599]  Well, I think your Asperger's spectrum undoubtedly just by all of it, but then you've got the overlay of the, of the environment that is inducive towards the zombiosis.
[02:11:11.639 --> 02:11:12.999]  What if I'm just a regular guy?
[02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:14.740]  What if you're just a lazy bum?
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:15.661]  Maybe you are just a bum.
[02:11:17.081 --> 02:11:21.845]  A contrarian bum that will never get the perfect thing he really wants.
[02:11:21.926 --> 02:11:24.147]  I'm just trying to figure out, is it a comfort thing?
[02:11:24.268 --> 02:11:28.671]  If you really want me to answer that question, why do you want to live at home?
[02:11:28.811 --> 02:11:29.952]  What is the deal with that?
[02:11:30.012 --> 02:11:31.273]  Why don't you want to get out?
[02:11:31.754 --> 02:11:32.935]  I don't want to live at home.
[02:11:33.035 --> 02:11:35.557]  What I've told other reporters is that
[02:11:37.719 --> 02:11:41.722]  When I had my son, he was a baby and I had him three full days a week.
[02:11:41.762 --> 02:11:44.344]  Two full weekdays and one weekend day.
[02:11:44.784 --> 02:11:46.886]  And it was really hard for me to find full-time employment like that.
[02:11:46.906 --> 02:11:47.847]  Wait a second, hold on a second.
[02:11:47.867 --> 02:11:48.487]  This is blowing my mind.
[02:11:48.507 --> 02:11:49.588]  You're a white male!
[02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:51.430]  You're an effing white male!
[02:11:51.490 --> 02:11:54.512]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[02:11:54.532 --> 02:11:54.772]  What?
[02:11:59.341 --> 02:12:02.462]  It's obviously an inside joke that you haven't heard yet.
[02:12:02.542 --> 02:12:05.002]  But apparently, you know, a white man has the white man privilege.
[02:12:05.022 --> 02:12:07.903]  So you're telling me you can't get a job so that you can move out of the house.
[02:12:07.923 --> 02:12:08.563]  That's what you're telling me.
[02:12:08.603 --> 02:12:09.243]  I didn't say that.
[02:12:09.283 --> 02:12:17.785]  I said that it wasn't really... I didn't have a lot of opportunities with all those days that I was, you know, being a father to my son, which was important and necessary.
[02:12:17.805 --> 02:12:19.125]  But do you have visiting rights right now?
[02:12:19.305 --> 02:12:19.465]  No.
[02:12:20.045 --> 02:12:21.105]  So what are you so busy with?
[02:12:21.286 --> 02:12:22.266]  I'm still trying to figure this out.
[02:12:22.366 --> 02:12:23.346]  Trying to get to see him again.
[02:12:23.366 --> 02:12:25.926]  That's what I've been doing for a long time.
[02:12:25.946 --> 02:12:28.187]  So you're battling with the courts and with lawyers right now?
[02:12:29.093 --> 02:12:29.673]  Just the courts.
[02:12:30.074 --> 02:12:30.734]  Oh, yeah, and lawyers.
[02:12:30.774 --> 02:12:31.335]  Yeah, courts and lawyers.
[02:12:31.355 --> 02:12:31.795]  You're exactly right.
[02:12:31.815 --> 02:12:38.020]  Okay, don't you think it might be advantageous for you to maybe, like, get some money behind this effort and maybe hire a lawyer?
[02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:41.503]  It's not going to change the merit of my contentions.
[02:12:42.708 --> 02:12:44.249]  Yeah, but it might help you, don't you think?
[02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:45.790]  I mean, this is a court of law.
[02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:46.811]  How would that help?
[02:12:47.411 --> 02:12:49.153]  Just by saying the magic words?
[02:12:49.973 --> 02:12:53.776]  I mean, dude, if you don't know how the judicial system works, I mean, clearly you don't.
[02:12:53.796 --> 02:12:54.536]  How does the judicial system work?
[02:12:54.556 --> 02:12:55.077]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:12:55.097 --> 02:12:57.298]  My ex-wife took the kids and filed up.
[02:12:57.498 --> 02:13:04.123]  I'd only have them four hours on the weekend and I went and got lawyers and went and had a big court battle and, you know, got my kids half the time.
[02:13:04.383 --> 02:13:06.024]  Have you ever been on your own, Michael?
[02:13:06.065 --> 02:13:07.285]  Have you ever been out of the parents' house?
[02:13:07.425 --> 02:13:07.626]  I have.
[02:13:08.345 --> 02:13:09.285]  And what was that like for you?
[02:13:09.325 --> 02:13:10.405]  Did you not like it?
[02:13:10.525 --> 02:13:11.226]  No, I loved it.
[02:13:11.246 --> 02:13:13.746]  It was great.
[02:13:14.126 --> 02:13:15.226]  You're very busy all the time.
[02:13:15.246 --> 02:13:16.307]  You gotta work.
[02:13:17.407 --> 02:13:26.989]  I think you should take up something like kickboxing or something athletic.
[02:13:27.009 --> 02:13:28.889]  Are you engaged in any athletic pursuits?
[02:13:29.529 --> 02:13:30.710]  I like to bicycle.
[02:13:32.290 --> 02:13:33.290]  Let's see, ride my bicycle.
[02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:34.410]  Another Bernie Sanders favorite?
[02:13:35.031 --> 02:13:35.291]  Is it?
[02:13:36.431 --> 02:13:36.771]  Is he around?
[02:13:38.228 --> 02:13:47.535]  How would you like, how would you like to be Bernie Sanders' assistant?
[02:13:49.556 --> 02:13:51.318]  Probably wouldn't like to assist someone else.
[02:13:52.078 --> 02:13:57.442]  Ah, I just figured because he wants to take care of everybody that's poor and that needs help, so I think he should give you a job.
[02:13:59.523 --> 02:14:02.826]  But you're not going to have any leftists actually offer anybody jobs, that's conservatives that do that.
[02:14:07.875 --> 02:14:08.595]  Were you breastfed?
[02:14:11.257 --> 02:14:11.897]  I don't remember.
[02:14:11.917 --> 02:14:20.641]  That's actually very important because the fatty acids in natural breast milk give you, your brain, a lot more power to develop than the formula.
[02:14:21.702 --> 02:14:26.204]  The brain will actually weigh 10-15% less, have a lot less neuron density.
[02:14:26.364 --> 02:14:28.865]  So wait, let me ask Michael, how old is your child?
[02:14:28.885 --> 02:14:29.005]  Eight.
[02:14:30.706 --> 02:14:30.866]  Eight?
[02:14:31.026 --> 02:14:32.566]  So you had that child at age 22?
[02:14:32.887 --> 02:14:33.947]  That's right.
[02:14:34.267 --> 02:14:36.968]  And so for eight years you've been fighting for custody?
[02:14:37.008 --> 02:14:37.848]  I mean, how does this go?
[02:14:38.088 --> 02:14:42.169]  Well, uh, when he was a baby, I really, I really, it wasn't feasible for me to work full-time.
[02:14:42.429 --> 02:14:46.670]  Um, after he started going to school... Seems like it's never feasible, feasible for you to work full-time.
[02:14:46.690 --> 02:14:48.810]  You know, I don't think anybody would like to work full-time.
[02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:52.331]  You know, everybody would like to just retire or live in someone's house.
[02:14:52.411 --> 02:14:53.331]  But I mean, you know... Not me!
[02:14:53.492 --> 02:14:55.012]  I want to, I want to work 24 hours a day.
[02:14:55.848 --> 02:14:58.492]  I had lost my job prior to that.
[02:14:58.512 --> 02:14:59.293]  I was fired.
[02:14:59.313 --> 02:15:00.895]  I was a little frustrated with employment.
[02:15:01.075 --> 02:15:11.549]  But after I had my son, after I was a father for a little while, I found that I had the gift that public schools offer us, which is the time to work with our kids.
[02:15:12.956 --> 02:15:15.939]  Uh, kept taking care of his school, and I found that I could.
[02:15:15.959 --> 02:15:22.145]  Did you see the WikiLeaks where Hillary said, I hate my constituents, they're a bunch of basement dwellers, and they're a bunch of idiot Maurice's.
[02:15:22.165 --> 02:15:27.931]  Well, a lot of Maurice's, a lot of Maurice's that live really good lives, but that's who she thinks her people are.
[02:15:28.331 --> 02:15:31.392]  I'm putting down the fact that you, like so many other millennials and trendies, don't have any
[02:15:52.452 --> 02:15:55.814]  Aspirations for life in the world, except politically running my life.
[02:15:56.175 --> 02:15:59.937]  You don't have the whole liberal control freak contingent though, so you're a little bit different.
[02:16:00.178 --> 02:16:00.778]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:09.284 --> 02:16:12.266]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[02:16:12.946 --> 02:16:13.747]  I wanna rock.
[02:16:14.468 --> 02:16:18.971]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour,
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:21.802]  You're gonna see some serious s***.
[02:16:21.822 --> 02:16:28.267]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:16:33.834 --> 02:16:38.276]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[02:16:39.416 --> 02:16:41.557]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[02:16:41.637 --> 02:16:43.498]  I could end this guy, John, tomorrow.
[02:16:43.618 --> 02:16:46.019]  All you gotta do is arm all your best.
[02:16:46.299 --> 02:16:54.663]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[02:16:54.803 --> 02:16:55.463]  Where's the beat?
[02:16:55.823 --> 02:16:57.724]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[02:16:58.902 --> 02:17:02.044]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[02:17:02.104 --> 02:17:10.270]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[02:17:10.630 --> 02:17:21.418]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and, in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller pulling the shot!
[02:17:22.769 --> 02:17:39.557]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[02:17:39.818 --> 02:17:46.401]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[02:17:46.741 --> 02:17:47.862]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[02:17:48.123 --> 02:17:52.748]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[02:17:52.888 --> 02:17:57.514]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[02:17:58.422 --> 02:18:03.085]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[02:18:03.386 --> 02:18:07.549]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:10.391]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[02:18:10.451 --> 02:18:17.936]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[02:18:18.277 --> 02:18:22.600]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:28.224]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[02:18:29.289 --> 02:18:30.429]  I'm scared of these people.
[02:18:31.149 --> 02:18:33.490]  I'm very scared of them.
[02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:40.571]  How do you think the crack drop gets into the country?
[02:18:40.611 --> 02:18:42.012]  We don't own any planes.
[02:18:42.472 --> 02:18:43.552]  We don't own no ships.
[02:18:43.792 --> 02:18:47.133]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[02:18:47.393 --> 02:18:54.094]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:18:56.415 --> 02:19:03.639]  Men who were working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[02:19:03.679 --> 02:19:08.621]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[02:19:08.661 --> 02:19:15.744]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small airbase at Mena, Arkansas.
[02:19:16.185 --> 02:19:22.988]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-contras
[02:19:23.548 --> 02:19:28.772]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[02:19:29.552 --> 02:19:35.456]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[02:19:36.056 --> 02:19:41.060]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[02:19:41.260 --> 02:19:44.442]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[02:19:44.962 --> 02:19:47.604]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[02:19:48.324 --> 02:19:52.608]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[02:19:52.648 --> 02:19:52.929]  Lewinsky.
[02:19:53.449 --> 02:19:55.391]  These allegations are false.
[02:19:56.752 --> 02:20:02.277]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:08.443]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:39.648 --> 02:20:41.109]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:20:41.169 --> 02:20:47.491]  I'm Alex Jones and Michael Rotondo, the 30-year-old who refused to move out of his parents' house, had been taken to court.
[02:20:47.571 --> 02:20:49.032]  The judge said, yeah, you got to get out.
[02:20:50.112 --> 02:20:53.393]  Liberal media, conservative media made fun of him and said, what a bum, what a horrible person.
[02:20:54.694 --> 02:20:58.195]  I was talking to Owen Schroer during the break and I said, what is your prognosis?
[02:20:58.615 --> 02:20:59.336]  You're a smart guy.
[02:20:59.356 --> 02:21:04.798]  And I talked to some of the other folks in there and they pretty much all came up with the same conclusion that I have in my heart.
[02:21:04.858 --> 02:21:05.518]  I think it's this.
[02:21:06.038 --> 02:21:07.339]  Owen, give us your take.
[02:21:08.407 --> 02:21:11.929]  Well, I think that you've just never had anybody really empower you.
[02:21:12.089 --> 02:21:21.393]  You've never felt that anyone has had faith in you or trust in you, so you've never felt the inclination to make more of yourself because you don't feel like anyone's ever believed in you.
[02:21:21.973 --> 02:21:34.139]  And when I saw that moment when Alex handed you the check but also talked about maybe hiring you, there was an emotion that I think came over you and I saw it in your face that it felt like for the first time somebody was willing to invest in you
[02:21:34.839 --> 02:21:40.405]  And that was empowering for you, to have that feeling that somebody is willing to stick their neck out there for you and invest in you.
[02:21:40.766 --> 02:21:42.968]  And I think for a lot of people, that's all it takes sometimes.
[02:21:42.988 --> 02:21:47.533]  It's just that little push of somebody having faith in you and investing in you that gets you going.
[02:21:47.553 --> 02:21:53.079]  And by the way, the globalists believe everybody's already done, so they're trying to dumb people down to control them to then depopulate.
[02:21:53.139 --> 02:21:55.923]  And that's what this whole anti-man, anti-woman agenda is.
[02:21:56.423 --> 02:21:59.884]  They admit in the WikiLeaks and the government documents the whole gay agenda is about that.
[02:21:59.924 --> 02:22:00.944]  I'm not bashing gay people.
[02:22:01.145 --> 02:22:01.885]  That's always happened.
[02:22:01.905 --> 02:22:02.765]  That's always been there.
[02:22:03.005 --> 02:22:06.166]  But the artificiality pushing it is about depopulation.
[02:22:06.526 --> 02:22:13.108]  And so people are going into these Asperger's type things that are artificial from the programming, from the television, from the Internet.
[02:22:13.549 --> 02:22:15.269]  And we're hypocrites.
[02:22:15.329 --> 02:22:16.309]  We're on this thing, too.
[02:22:16.750 --> 02:22:17.850]  That's how we're reaching people.
[02:22:17.890 --> 02:22:20.691]  But I'm telling you, I see this in more and more young people.
[02:22:21.658 --> 02:22:28.263]  I know you are 30, but I'm seeing this in a lot of males, especially, who don't thrive in the outside world.
[02:22:28.303 --> 02:22:33.326]  People don't, you know, have barbecues or, you know, outside at night like when I was a kid.
[02:22:33.346 --> 02:22:34.827]  People were still outside most of the time.
[02:22:35.107 --> 02:22:36.668]  Maybe we watch a Saturday night movie or...
[02:22:37.549 --> 02:22:40.711]  Well, I'll just say this, and if there's anybody else that wants to talk to Michael here.
[02:23:06.084 --> 02:23:06.824]  I think you're right, Alex.
[02:23:06.864 --> 02:23:13.526]  I think this is a common issue and it's different than the government just saying, oh, you know, here's a check or welfare or a hand up or everything.
[02:23:13.766 --> 02:23:14.966]  That doesn't really empower you.
[02:23:15.006 --> 02:23:16.126]  That doesn't really influence you.
[02:23:16.146 --> 02:23:18.047]  That makes you want to get more comfortable.
[02:23:18.387 --> 02:23:25.709]  Whereas if somebody, if a person invests in you, now you're answering to them and there's a, there's a, there's an actual human experience there.
[02:23:25.729 --> 02:23:28.489]  There's a bonding experience there that can make a man a man.
[02:23:28.949 --> 02:23:30.710]  So I think that that's the big difference here.
[02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:33.751]  And, um, I think that this is just something that a lot of people lack.
[02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:34.651]  They don't have leadership.
[02:23:34.691 --> 02:23:35.371]  They don't, whether it's,
[02:23:36.032 --> 02:23:39.862]  In a family or in school or whatever it is, they just don't have somebody that's willing to invest in them.
[02:23:40.483 --> 02:23:43.612]  And I'll just say this in closing, you know, I don't know, I don't know what...
[02:23:45.037 --> 02:23:58.045]  I'll just say this, Michael, I don't know what you think the best options are right now for you to get your kid back, but I would say your best option is to work your tail off and get a great job, and yeah, make some money, get your own home, and then the judge will whip you better.
[02:23:58.065 --> 02:24:03.669]  We're going to keep it in here for one episode, one more segment, when Saw Man comes on with you, when we're plugging your big veteran special.
[02:24:03.969 --> 02:24:11.434]  He's coming up today on The War Room, and Saw Man, former Navy SEAL patriot, his buddy just got the Congressional Medal of Honor yesterday, pretty big deal.
[02:24:12.134 --> 02:24:14.917]  We're going to be breaking all that down and heading into Memorial Day.
[02:24:14.957 --> 02:24:16.017]  But great points, Owen.
[02:24:16.518 --> 02:24:18.099]  And again, jump at any time, Michael.
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:23.604]  Again, the man that's 30 years old, being evicted from his parents' house in court this week, if you just tuned in.
[02:24:23.624 --> 02:24:29.929]  And let's bring in Daria, or let's bring in Jake Lloyd, or let's bring in any of the other folks that want to get on there.
[02:24:30.029 --> 02:24:31.010]  Well, I want to answer his question.
[02:24:31.050 --> 02:24:31.791]  Go ahead.
[02:24:31.951 --> 02:24:38.839]  What he said was, you know, that he alluded to the fact that he believed that I had never had someone who believed in me, and that's not true.
[02:24:38.880 --> 02:24:40.622]  I've had great school teachers who have believed in me.
[02:24:40.662 --> 02:24:47.630]  I think everyone has had that, but I don't think it happens enough, and I think that a lot of what you're speaking to with the
[02:24:50.808 --> 02:24:55.290]  Things that you wish would change comes from the schools.
[02:24:55.550 --> 02:24:57.911]  Well you need to not, here's the deal, you need to not procrastinate.
[02:24:58.271 --> 02:25:01.412]  You need to let yourself be in other organizations and not at the top.
[02:25:01.852 --> 02:25:05.934]  And learn that if you just execute and innovate, you'll be moved to the top immediately.
[02:25:06.254 --> 02:25:06.574]  Alright.
[02:25:07.214 --> 02:25:14.097]  Look, people are looking for people who will just do what they're told, understand the information, and then move up in the hierarchy of things.
[02:25:14.537 --> 02:25:17.538]  And you'll find once you move up in the hierarchy of things, it's actually a big responsibility.
[02:25:17.918 --> 02:25:23.583]  But it does advance your mental clarity, understanding as you learn how to deal with more responsibility, more stress.
[02:25:23.603 --> 02:25:24.003]  You understand?
[02:25:24.143 --> 02:25:24.323]  Yeah.
[02:25:24.924 --> 02:25:27.926]  And that's what the whole hierarchy of needs in life is about.
[02:25:27.986 --> 02:25:31.289]  And it's about ascending to the level of where you actually want to then help others.
[02:25:31.890 --> 02:25:32.310]  Like your son.
[02:25:32.610 --> 02:25:33.131]  Which you want to do.
[02:25:33.911 --> 02:25:35.132]  So you aspire to that.
[02:25:35.152 --> 02:25:36.333]  It's not about helping, it's my son.
[02:25:36.553 --> 02:25:36.814]  I know.
[02:25:36.894 --> 02:25:42.859]  But you have to sacrifice and not do things the way you want them every time to get in the position to get your son back.
[02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:45.381]  Maybe.
[02:25:46.361 --> 02:25:46.502]  No!
[02:25:48.203 --> 02:25:49.984]  Without sacrifice, there's nothing, my friend.
[02:25:50.484 --> 02:25:53.105]  Let's bring Jake Lloyd in and Drew wants to get in and whoever else.
[02:25:54.585 --> 02:25:58.527]  Yeah, so I guess what I'm wondering is where is your motivation?
[02:25:58.747 --> 02:26:01.508]  Like, did you ever have any dreams when you were a kid?
[02:26:01.528 --> 02:26:03.229]  Did you have any motivation or anything?
[02:26:03.269 --> 02:26:05.950]  Because I guess it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[02:26:06.310 --> 02:26:07.671]  I joined the Army at 17.
[02:26:08.171 --> 02:26:08.711]  I got out.
[02:26:08.851 --> 02:26:09.451]  I'm working here now.
[02:26:09.471 --> 02:26:13.493]  I'm 21 years old and I feel like I'm not motivated enough because I measure up
[02:26:14.133 --> 02:26:21.016]  I measure myself against people in the past, like Teddy Roosevelt, people who were doing great things in the past, and I'm doing what I'm doing now.
[02:26:21.076 --> 02:26:21.796]  It's good, but it's not that.
[02:26:21.836 --> 02:26:24.677]  So I don't, I guess, I'm just curious, where is your motivation in life?
[02:26:24.957 --> 02:26:27.978]  And if it's to get your son back, what are you doing to get him back?
[02:26:28.498 --> 02:26:37.502]  Because you say, oh, he's incredibly important to me, he's all that I, you know, the biggest thing in my life, but that doesn't seem to be true because you're not acting that out in your life.
[02:26:38.851 --> 02:26:48.918]  I've been going through a very arduous and costly and time-consuming legal process to try and get him back, based on the fact that I was entitled to get him back.
[02:26:49.799 --> 02:26:53.882]  Not based on the fact that I need to have a job to get him back.
[02:26:54.702 --> 02:26:55.423]  You do need a job.
[02:26:55.623 --> 02:26:56.063]  You do need a job.
[02:26:56.083 --> 02:26:56.764]  People need income.
[02:26:57.644 --> 02:26:58.845]  Yeah, you need a job to support your kids.
[02:26:58.865 --> 02:27:02.408]  Listen, you described on air in an off-air that the court basically found you incompetent.
[02:27:03.493 --> 02:27:05.915]  That is a reasonable characterization of what happened, yeah.
[02:27:06.275 --> 02:27:08.657]  Because it is incompetent if you won't get out of your parents' house at 30.
[02:27:08.978 --> 02:27:11.940]  It is incompetent if you won't do the things it takes to get stuff done.
[02:27:13.081 --> 02:27:14.683]  I mean, that's not fair to the kid.
[02:27:14.883 --> 02:27:18.626]  That's not fair to your kid at all if you're going to not have a job, if you're going to live at your parents' house.
[02:27:19.066 --> 02:27:21.749]  I mean, that's not raising him properly.
[02:27:21.789 --> 02:27:23.630]  And I'm not trying to jump on you here, man.
[02:27:23.650 --> 02:27:24.471]  I'm trying to help you.
[02:27:25.072 --> 02:27:25.352]  Alright.
[02:27:27.574 --> 02:27:29.195]  Have you ever been in a physical fight?
[02:27:29.615 --> 02:27:29.776]  Yeah.
[02:27:30.632 --> 02:27:34.998]  I'm not saying that's a great thing, that's generally a lot of folks... It happens to a lot of people.
[02:27:35.199 --> 02:27:35.639]  How old were you?
[02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:38.023]  Which time?
[02:27:38.644 --> 02:27:39.845]  I'm just seeing if you've lived any.
[02:27:40.807 --> 02:27:41.388]  Have I lived any?
[02:27:41.568 --> 02:27:41.768]  Yes.
[02:27:41.928 --> 02:27:42.629]  Yeah, a few.
[02:27:43.471 --> 02:27:44.913]  Alright, great points Jake Lloyd.
[02:27:44.933 --> 02:27:45.954]  Let's bring in the next question.
[02:27:46.054 --> 02:27:46.996]  Who wants to get in there next?
[02:27:51.733 --> 02:27:52.493]  Oh, can y'all hear me?
[02:27:52.573 --> 02:27:52.933]  I'm on?
[02:27:53.093 --> 02:27:53.173]  Yeah.
[02:27:53.193 --> 02:27:54.074]  I can hear you great.
[02:27:54.134 --> 02:27:55.074]  And we're going to hold you over.
[02:27:55.354 --> 02:27:56.134]  Start your question.
[02:27:56.354 --> 02:27:59.135]  So I'm naturally lazy as well.
[02:27:59.795 --> 02:28:05.316]  But with that being said, I'm almost 30 now, done a lot of stuff with my life.
[02:28:05.456 --> 02:28:12.218]  So what I'm really asking you is what has, besides your kid, what has been your biggest achievement since you've been an adult?
[02:28:16.779 --> 02:28:18.259]  I have not considered anything like that.
[02:28:20.819 --> 02:28:21.899]  My biggest achievement.
[02:28:22.239 --> 02:28:25.180]  Achievement since then?
[02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:25.740]  What's that?
[02:28:26.021 --> 02:28:28.041]  You haven't considered anything an achievement since then?
[02:28:28.101 --> 02:28:32.963]  No, I haven't considered what my... I'm trying to think of one thing that I would consider to be an achievement, and I'm having a hard time.
[02:28:33.903 --> 02:28:35.423]  That seems to be a problem.
[02:28:35.443 --> 02:28:36.264]  Yeah, that's a bad sign.
[02:28:36.364 --> 02:28:37.264]  Stay there, Drew.
[02:28:37.784 --> 02:28:38.664]  I'll tell you your achievement.
[02:28:38.884 --> 02:28:39.084]  What?
[02:28:39.164 --> 02:28:45.186]  You finally started to fight when they kicked your ass out of the nest, which is the beginning of how they're trying to help you, and now you're on InfoWars.
[02:28:46.587 --> 02:28:47.387]  Because I'm a slacker?
[02:28:48.291 --> 02:28:49.112]  Because I was a slacker?
[02:28:49.612 --> 02:28:50.692]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:28:51.533 --> 02:28:52.594]  We're gonna transform you.
[02:28:52.634 --> 02:28:53.534]  Oh yeah?
[02:28:53.874 --> 02:28:58.377]  From slacker man to super hair man!
[02:28:59.277 --> 02:29:02.359]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:06.982]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.

[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:36.489]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.

[02:31:33.273 --> 02:31:34.514]  We are not victims.
[02:31:34.694 --> 02:31:35.915]  We are victorious.
[02:31:36.295 --> 02:31:41.239]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[02:31:41.319 --> 02:31:45.983]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.

[02:32:05.076 --> 02:32:06.417]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[02:32:06.657 --> 02:32:10.179]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform at the level we'd like to.
[02:32:10.540 --> 02:32:18.285]  InfoWars Live Secret 12 is designed to naturally energize your body and mind with two great tasting and super high quality forms of vitamin B12.
[02:32:18.485 --> 02:32:23.309]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:28.933]  The reality is it's hard to take in the proper amount of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[02:32:29.273 --> 02:32:36.797]  Secret 12 by Infowars Life is an easy way to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake and support your body's natural systems.
[02:32:37.057 --> 02:32:41.499]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[02:32:41.759 --> 02:32:47.502]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels through red blood cell formation and aiding in the body's natural processes.
[02:32:47.622 --> 02:32:50.603]  But it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[02:32:50.783 --> 02:32:54.063]  Electrify your mind and body and take your health to the next level.
[02:32:54.344 --> 02:32:58.024]  Experience the power of Secret 12 at Infowarslife.com.
[02:32:58.224 --> 02:33:00.325]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:33:06.746 --> 02:33:09.347]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:29.938 --> 02:33:32.399]  All right, Craig Shroyer.
[02:33:53.140 --> 02:33:54.721]  I just crossed their names.
[02:33:54.861 --> 02:34:00.165]  Owen Schroyer and Saw Man is also here with us today.
[02:34:00.545 --> 02:34:03.747]  So there's so much to get to, so much to go over.
[02:34:03.767 --> 02:34:07.710]  There's going to be a veteran special today that they're going to have for three hours.
[02:34:07.730 --> 02:34:10.092]  Owen Schroyer and Craig Schroyer.
[02:34:10.512 --> 02:34:14.315]  That's like saying she shucked she shells by the seashore.
[02:34:14.835 --> 02:34:16.477]  I'm having trouble saying it.
[02:34:16.517 --> 02:34:20.640]  Both names are easy to say, but when you say them combined together, it gets a little hard.
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:27.906]  So Owen Schroer and Craig Sawyer, veterans, call in special show ahead of Memorial Day this Monday.
[02:34:28.267 --> 02:34:34.472]  A voice for our veterans, what's happening in the VA, what they think of Trump, all the things that are happening, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[02:34:34.512 --> 02:34:35.553]  That's at 3 p.m.
[02:34:35.613 --> 02:34:37.014]  today in about an hour.
[02:34:38.135 --> 02:34:40.279]  And a half from now.
[02:34:40.399 --> 02:34:44.166]  Please tell everybody about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:34:44.506 --> 02:34:45.588]  Please share the link.
[02:34:46.667 --> 02:34:50.928]  for folks and please tell people about the local radio and TV stations that you're tuning into.
[02:34:50.968 --> 02:34:56.770]  We'll be talking to Craig and Owen in the next segment about what's coming up in the War Room today.
[02:34:57.230 --> 02:35:11.835]  Roger Stone's also supposed to pop in right now, but I may just do that in the first five minutes of the next hour, just to point out that he's now been told by the Mueller people, yeah, it's not Russiagate, we're looking at your finances to put your ass in prison and you better, they've telegraphed,
[02:35:12.395 --> 02:35:14.256]  You better turn your back on the President.
[02:35:14.757 --> 02:35:18.059]  And Giuliani went on Fox and said they know Roger's not going to do that.
[02:35:18.880 --> 02:35:24.884]  Roger told me last night and he said today on the news that he's not turning his back because there's nothing to turn his back on.
[02:35:25.104 --> 02:35:29.247]  There's nothing been done, nothing illegal, nothing wrong, no nothing.
[02:35:29.647 --> 02:35:37.153]  And so Craig, talking to you, your buddy also just won the Congressional Medal of Honor yesterday from the same team that you were on.
[02:35:37.173 --> 02:35:38.794]  I guess his nickname's Slab.
[02:35:38.814 --> 02:35:40.895]  You're going to be breaking that down as well.
[02:35:40.955 --> 02:35:41.756]  So tell us what's coming up.
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:44.181]  Well, yeah.
[02:35:44.241 --> 02:35:48.504]  Britt Slabinski was on my sniper crew for years in the SEAL teams.
[02:35:48.544 --> 02:35:52.587]  He's a great guy and he got the Medal of Honor yesterday from the President.
[02:35:52.967 --> 02:35:55.989]  It was an ugly battle and a lot of heartache there.
[02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:58.971]  I know Slab didn't even want the award.
[02:35:59.031 --> 02:36:05.416]  He's been awarded heavily prior to that and he's a warrior in every sense of the word.
[02:36:06.036 --> 02:36:10.099]  He's a reluctant recipient of that award due to the brothers left on
[02:36:11.022 --> 02:36:13.985]  That we lost in that battle, but that's the nature of battle.
[02:36:14.005 --> 02:36:14.766]  It's imperfect.
[02:36:14.786 --> 02:36:23.995]  Slab's a great warrior, but it's good to see him recognized, and all the guys at that level really deserve to be recognized for it.
[02:36:24.415 --> 02:36:28.019]  Great warriors defending our homeland against the unthinkable.
[02:36:28.139 --> 02:36:29.160]  So, God bless them all.
[02:36:30.470 --> 02:36:35.554]  I know on air you'll really never talk about any of the operations you've been part of, obviously, because that's all classified.
[02:36:36.074 --> 02:36:40.878]  And are we even able to know the specifics of why he got the Congressional Medal of Honor?
[02:36:42.359 --> 02:36:48.704]  Yeah, they talked through the citation live on national television.
[02:36:48.724 --> 02:36:50.625]  The president actually read it.
[02:36:50.986 --> 02:36:53.207]  Well, I missed that yesterday because I was so busy with other things.
[02:36:53.367 --> 02:36:56.089]  So we're going to re-air that today coming up during the war room.
[02:36:56.109 --> 02:36:57.871]  We'll find that and air that because that's important.
[02:36:58.752 --> 02:37:05.676]  Yeah man, those guys deserve to be recognized and Slab deserves to be recognized for his contributions on the field of battle there.
[02:37:06.617 --> 02:37:07.517]  Just amazing stuff.
[02:37:08.338 --> 02:37:10.139]  Now let's juxtapose that, not in a mean way.
[02:37:10.179 --> 02:37:14.041]  I'm sure you've heard of Michael Rotondo, the 30-year-old that wouldn't get out of his parents' house?
[02:37:16.102 --> 02:37:16.823]  Only briefly.
[02:37:16.883 --> 02:37:18.424]  I've been quite busy running our
[02:37:19.716 --> 02:37:21.157]  Operations for the children, Alex.
[02:37:21.197 --> 02:37:22.879]  So I get glimpses of the news.
[02:37:23.439 --> 02:37:24.820]  And that's what we'll talk about in the next segment.
[02:37:24.840 --> 02:37:27.882]  Boy, is Trump and you guys and everybody really delivering.
[02:37:27.922 --> 02:37:31.865]  There are just massive pedophile roundups going on, but we can't get into it all.
[02:37:31.925 --> 02:37:35.808]  The numbers are out there, like eight, nine times the previous number under Obama.
[02:37:36.369 --> 02:37:38.831]  And the left's really panicking, and more and more of this is coming out.
[02:37:39.651 --> 02:37:41.773]  But that's definitely panicking the globalists right now.
[02:37:43.014 --> 02:37:43.654]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:37:43.815 --> 02:37:46.036]  Well, there's a
[02:37:47.578 --> 02:37:49.981]  Massive struggle for power over the United States.
[02:37:50.141 --> 02:38:02.276]  We see it getting more desperate on the left, on the globalist side, as Trump makes more progress and gets his footing as commander-in-chief of the United States and starts exposing more of the truth.
[02:38:02.536 --> 02:38:06.521]  The globalists and the radical left are getting more and more desperate.
[02:38:06.561 --> 02:38:07.282]  So it's interesting.
[02:38:07.802 --> 02:38:08.903]  These are interesting times.
[02:38:09.083 --> 02:38:09.944]  Highly contested.
[02:38:10.144 --> 02:38:12.165]  So, we'll stand by and watch.
[02:38:27.034 --> 02:38:29.295]  We got Drew and some other folks that have questions for you.
[02:38:29.355 --> 02:38:29.475]  Great.
[02:38:29.935 --> 02:38:31.096]  You can respond.
[02:38:31.176 --> 02:38:32.736]  I got something, Alex, if you don't mind.
[02:38:33.257 --> 02:38:33.637]  Sure.
[02:38:34.237 --> 02:38:34.937]  Can I interject?
[02:38:35.217 --> 02:38:41.220]  I would just encourage him, look, if you love somebody, you want them empowered.
[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.681]  Man, I teach my son everything that I can.
[02:38:43.741 --> 02:38:46.962]  And look at, take a little league football team.
[02:38:46.982 --> 02:38:48.663]  Man, they train those boys hard.
[02:38:48.723 --> 02:38:48.903]  Why?
[02:38:48.943 --> 02:38:51.104]  Because they want them to be prepared to win.
[02:38:51.765 --> 02:38:53.669]  Or to perform well during the game.
[02:38:53.709 --> 02:38:55.453]  And we all want that for our kids, man.
[02:38:55.954 --> 02:38:57.598]  And so, sometimes, love.
[02:38:57.638 --> 02:38:59.983]  If you really care about somebody, you want them empowered.
[02:39:00.043 --> 02:39:02.008]  And growth is always difficult.
[02:39:02.711 --> 02:39:06.414]  It's sometimes painful, but it's beneficial.
[02:39:06.594 --> 02:39:15.362]  So I would encourage this guy, hey look, yep, his life has been what it has been until now, but before him lies unlimited potential.
[02:39:15.842 --> 02:39:23.249]  And I would say push through the discomfort of growing into a more responsible man and going for his better self.
[02:39:24.275 --> 02:39:38.243]  Exactly, because I saw the media just put him down and call him names, and I'm trying to kick him in the butt to get him thinking, but if you look at how he had to pay for all the illegal aliens and all the anchor babies, and for people's sex changes, that's far more lazy and bad than him.
[02:39:38.703 --> 02:39:40.704]  So then how is he the worst guy in America?
[02:39:40.724 --> 02:39:43.686]  That's basically what they said this week, and then they ignore all the rest of this stuff.
[02:39:43.926 --> 02:39:44.986]  He becomes a scapegoat.
[02:39:45.006 --> 02:39:48.708]  I'm not saying you're a victim, I'm just saying on a scale of laziness, you're kind of in the middle.
[02:39:48.808 --> 02:39:49.549]  You're not the worst guy.
[02:39:50.632 --> 02:39:51.312]  It sounds reasonable.
[02:39:52.172 --> 02:40:00.634]  I wanted to answer a question I got earlier where someone asked me what my greatest accomplishment was, and it's my belief that I've raised a child who is smarter than I was.
[02:40:00.974 --> 02:40:01.694]  Besides your son.
[02:40:02.594 --> 02:40:03.255]  Oh, besides that?
[02:40:03.395 --> 02:40:06.215]  Yeah, besides your son, what has been your greatest achievement since you turned 18?
[02:40:07.015 --> 02:40:08.916]  Oh, that's what I prepared as the answer for that.
[02:40:08.936 --> 02:40:09.536]  You prepared it?
[02:40:09.676 --> 02:40:10.256]  Yeah.
[02:40:10.316 --> 02:40:10.856]  That's the problem.
[02:40:10.916 --> 02:40:13.257]  It took you that long through the break to think of one, though.
[02:40:13.397 --> 02:40:14.877]  How am I supposed to come in before the break?
[02:40:14.917 --> 02:40:19.518]  Okay, well, without that, would you say that your life has been fulfilling?
[02:40:20.198 --> 02:40:20.378]  Yeah.
[02:40:21.873 --> 02:40:30.582]  In what way being as though you haven't, you can't even find out what you've achieved, you can't even answer what you've achieved, how do you feel fulfilled?
[02:40:32.243 --> 02:40:34.666]  I feel like I can accomplish what I seek to.
[02:40:36.329 --> 02:40:43.092]  Or, if I can't accomplish what I was attempting to, I've made accomplishments in order to get there.
[02:40:43.592 --> 02:40:45.012]  Well, listen, I'm not trying to put you down.
[02:40:45.672 --> 02:40:46.073]  Thanks, Drew.
[02:40:46.093 --> 02:40:46.813]  Let's bring Daria on.
[02:40:46.833 --> 02:40:49.294]  Let's make her get on here, because I know she's had some comments.
[02:40:49.794 --> 02:40:51.655]  She didn't want to get on air, but she said she did earlier.
[02:40:51.675 --> 02:40:53.915]  Daria, get over here, because I'm not trying to be mean to you.
[02:40:53.935 --> 02:40:55.556]  You've got to get out of the comfort zone, like you said.
[02:40:55.576 --> 02:40:56.997]  And just do little things.
[02:40:57.037 --> 02:40:57.817]  Just get a job.
[02:41:00.851 --> 02:41:04.073]  Well, I just think, Alex, you said something... That's not Daria!
[02:41:04.113 --> 02:41:06.034]  She refuses to go on.
[02:41:06.415 --> 02:41:07.976]  I think that Alex was right, though, Michael.
[02:41:08.016 --> 02:41:13.099]  Your greatest accomplishment was this legal battle with your parents to live at home or not live at home.
[02:41:13.259 --> 02:41:15.240]  You finally fought for something!
[02:41:15.380 --> 02:41:18.883]  This is going to be the moment in your life that changes everything.
[02:41:19.103 --> 02:41:19.743]  I have a feeling for you.
[02:41:19.763 --> 02:41:20.864]  You have good energy, Michael.
[02:41:21.104 --> 02:41:21.404]  Thank you.
[02:41:22.585 --> 02:41:23.366]  Trying to be positive.
[02:41:23.426 --> 02:41:24.506]  Daria was going to get on air.
[02:41:24.526 --> 02:41:26.908]  I don't know where she is.
[02:41:26.928 --> 02:41:29.750]  Does anybody else, the minute and a half we have left, want to talk to him?
[02:41:29.770 --> 02:41:30.030]  Go ahead.
[02:41:30.947 --> 02:41:31.627]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:34.509]  You want to ask Owen a question or me?
[02:41:34.529 --> 02:41:35.470]  Owen, can I ask you a question?
[02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:36.030]  Yeah, what's up?
[02:41:36.791 --> 02:41:39.012]  Or no, I forgot what this gentleman's name is over here.
[02:41:39.353 --> 02:41:39.613]  Drew?
[02:41:39.813 --> 02:41:40.153]  Drew!
[02:41:40.313 --> 02:41:41.194]  Drew, get Drew on here.
[02:41:42.655 --> 02:41:43.936]  No, this gentleman, who's the guy?
[02:41:43.976 --> 02:41:44.556]  Saw Man!
[02:41:44.596 --> 02:41:45.136]  Saw Man!
[02:41:45.557 --> 02:41:47.238]  Go ahead, buddy.
[02:41:48.899 --> 02:41:49.940]  Is that on your birth certificate?
[02:41:49.960 --> 02:41:51.020]  Craig Sawyer.
[02:41:52.161 --> 02:41:52.982]  He was a Mall Cop.
[02:41:53.595 --> 02:41:56.856]  Greg, feel free to just disregard my question because it's complicated.
[02:41:57.656 --> 02:41:59.057]  Do you have a scope?
[02:41:59.537 --> 02:42:03.758]  Do you have a theater scale where you can... We've got a minute and a half, buddy, so be quick.
[02:42:03.858 --> 02:42:12.481]  Do you have a theater scale where you can share with us the scope of some of the things that these men who've been awarded the Medal of Honor?
[02:42:13.642 --> 02:42:15.062]  Can you share with us what they've done?
[02:42:15.102 --> 02:42:16.102]  Well, that would take about 5,000 hours.
[02:42:16.122 --> 02:42:19.684]  For this thing here or for that thing there?
[02:42:21.755 --> 02:42:24.516]  The word hero exists for guys like that.
[02:42:24.656 --> 02:42:25.557]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:42:25.597 --> 02:42:26.057]  They earn it.
[02:42:26.117 --> 02:42:31.539]  They disregard their own safety and they run to save their buddies from the unthinkable.
[02:42:31.739 --> 02:42:34.520]  They fight through things that normal people would not.
[02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:36.181]  That's what the Medal of Honor is all about.
[02:42:37.281 --> 02:42:38.882]  We celebrate those who earn it.
[02:42:39.082 --> 02:42:42.104]  Can't talk about anything specifically about what they were involved in?
[02:42:42.124 --> 02:42:44.605]  Well, we're going to get to this one because this was declassified.
[02:42:44.966 --> 02:42:45.306]  Oh yeah?
[02:42:45.546 --> 02:42:48.248]  When he's hosting for three hours coming up, we're going to pull that up.
[02:42:49.488 --> 02:42:51.109]  The gentleman getting the medal of honor yesterday, the seal.
[02:42:51.550 --> 02:42:54.812]  Listen, we're going to be talking more once the show's over.
[02:42:54.952 --> 02:42:56.372]  So, you've done a great job.
[02:42:56.393 --> 02:42:57.933]  You made $3,000 coming here.
[02:42:58.094 --> 02:42:58.294]  Yeah.
[02:42:58.314 --> 02:42:59.234]  It's part of capitalism.
[02:42:59.254 --> 02:42:59.955]  See how that did for you?
[02:42:59.995 --> 02:43:00.915]  Are you happy so far?
[02:43:01.055 --> 02:43:01.956]  Yes, you got out of the house.
[02:43:02.256 --> 02:43:09.504]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:43:09.884 --> 02:43:17.433]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:17.813 --> 02:43:20.896]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:21.517 --> 02:43:25.782]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:26.162 --> 02:43:30.086]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:30.306 --> 02:43:33.049]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:33.450 --> 02:43:37.734]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:38.215 --> 02:43:41.258]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:41.658 --> 02:43:56.508]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:43:56.748 --> 02:43:58.049]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:43:58.289 --> 02:44:00.631]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:44:04.881 --> 02:44:18.013]  Now, joining me is Phil Labonte from All That Remains, a band that I know that many InfoWars listeners, many Alex Jones fans are going to be huge, huge devotees to.
[02:44:18.733 --> 02:44:19.934]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:44:20.094 --> 02:44:31.004]  Now, you are not one of the singers, one of the members of the metal community who is advocating for gun control, and you're coming in for a bit of criticism as a result.
[02:44:31.044 --> 02:44:31.745]  What happened to you?
[02:44:33.520 --> 02:44:34.121]  No, I do not.
[02:44:35.042 --> 02:44:36.844]  I do not advocate for gun control.
[02:44:38.466 --> 02:44:51.039]  In light of the Florida shooting, you know, a lot of people reacted emotionally, which is understandable, and there's a lot of people making calls for gun control, but they don't
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:45:17.532]  Really elaborate what they're asking for so I think that a lot of the breakdown between people that would be considered on my side And people that would be considered on the other side a lot of the breakdown is trying to understand each other So I made a short video that was trying to explain why after these shootings there isn't just an instant law passed that'll just fix the problem in that
[02:45:18.846 --> 02:45:29.680]  If there is a law passed, that law is going to come with problems and so I put up the video and there is a metal blog that has had an issue with me for a long time because I just won't go away apparently.
[02:45:32.020 --> 02:45:41.405]  20 years of being in the same band and 10 years of these guys dogging me because I won't stop making music is basically the history of it.
[02:45:41.565 --> 02:45:51.551]  You mean to tell me that the inflamed objections of social justice warriors have not been enough to turn you off your lifelong passion and your career?
[02:45:52.031 --> 02:45:53.092]  Good heavens!
[02:45:53.272 --> 02:45:57.414]  There's me thinking you would crumble and fall over like a pack of
[02:45:58.074 --> 02:46:22.651]  I do understand that it's that there is a lot of pressure from the media from You know, so there is a lot of social pressure to have the correct opinions politically correct opinions and When you're dealing with something like this particular shooting and guns in general I think that it's it's hard to Come up with an actual answer.
[02:46:23.291 --> 02:46:27.234]  So when you're kind of expected to say something on it
[02:46:27.554 --> 02:46:28.695]  Is that what they say?
[02:46:57.974 --> 02:47:07.776]  We're all living in America!
[02:47:07.796 --> 02:47:10.857]  America is wunderbar!
[02:47:14.598 --> 02:47:17.918]  We're all living in America!
[02:47:47.875 --> 02:47:49.295]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:49.635 --> 02:47:51.175]  We're getting Craig back on a Skype drop.
[02:47:51.636 --> 02:47:58.437]  Owen Schreuer, you're going to be hosting a three-hour transmission with Craig, a veterans call-in, just for veterans to call in.
[02:47:58.457 --> 02:48:03.599]  Obviously, you'll be covering some of the news, but that's coming up in about an hour and 13 minutes with the war room.
[02:48:05.606 --> 02:48:13.210]  Well, you see the attack that InfoWars is under, and I haven't even plugged maybe one minute, a minute and a half to the last two hours plus.
[02:48:13.610 --> 02:48:15.191]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment.
[02:48:15.291 --> 02:48:17.672]  I should plug every segment.
[02:48:17.732 --> 02:48:22.214]  Then I wouldn't have to sit up here and freak out about expanding in the face of the globalists.
[02:48:22.234 --> 02:48:24.836]  But people have to understand, there's something called
[02:48:26.158 --> 02:48:30.346]  Trump-nesia with a lot of people who think since Trump's in, everything's okay.
[02:48:30.626 --> 02:48:32.750]  The total war is on right now.
[02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:34.032]  A lot of people get that.
[02:48:34.633 --> 02:48:36.557]  A lot of people don't, but let me tell you who does get it.
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:42.724]  The left are in their maximum push, and the more desperate they get, the more desperate they get.
[02:48:43.164 --> 02:48:45.886]  The more out of control they get, the more out of control they get.
[02:48:46.166 --> 02:48:53.591]  The more they lie and it doesn't work, they quadruple and quintuple and just leverage it into total cloud cuckoo land.
[02:48:54.352 --> 02:49:04.459]  And we are winning, but let me tell you, and I'm not complaining, I asked for this, I just don't want to personally, you know, have the pleasure of tearing us to pieces, because they're certainly trying, as you can see all over the news.
[02:49:06.508 --> 02:49:16.117]  I led the broadcast with this, so I'm going to get Craig back on, separate from the veterans, that's important, because he's helping a lot of folks lead the charge to round up the pedophile rings and all the rest of it.
[02:49:16.537 --> 02:49:23.603]  It's really happening, and everything we were told about Weinstein is now coming out, thanks to Schneiderman getting removed.
[02:49:23.623 --> 02:49:27.286]  He was protecting him, and this is the real counter-strike.
[02:49:27.386 --> 02:49:31.450]  This is Trump's counter-strike, as we told you was coming in November of 2016.
[02:49:33.872 --> 02:49:40.876]  And Drudge linking to our spirit cooking articles, and you know, exposing the pedophile rings, and then them creating side diversions that were honeypots for us.
[02:49:41.216 --> 02:49:42.837]  Were not perfect, some of us fell into them.
[02:49:43.198 --> 02:49:44.538]  You know, the distractions with Pizzagate.
[02:49:44.979 --> 02:49:48.881]  But now, the real counter-offensive is taking place.
[02:49:49.281 --> 02:49:50.002]  This is a big deal.
[02:49:50.142 --> 02:49:50.302]  Owen?
[02:49:51.411 --> 02:50:00.018]  Well, like you said, I mean, even the night of the election, though, Alex, you had some reservations about celebrating because you said, I know that the left is going to push back.
[02:50:00.118 --> 02:50:03.361]  You know, we just had a major victory, but the globalists are not going to go away.
[02:50:03.761 --> 02:50:05.063]  You know, they've invested so much in this.
[02:50:05.083 --> 02:50:08.385]  Well, it's like you take a port in a war, but then
[02:50:09.626 --> 02:50:11.368]  50 ships come pulling around the corner to retake it.
[02:50:11.408 --> 02:50:12.568]  I mean, we're in a war.
[02:50:13.049 --> 02:50:14.470]  We've not won the war yet.
[02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:18.012]  Yeah, we won a Death Star level destruction event.
[02:50:18.412 --> 02:50:21.355]  But as we all know, just because you blow the Death Star up doesn't mean the Empire still ain't out there.
[02:50:21.535 --> 02:50:23.296]  Well, the globalists have a survival instinct too.
[02:50:23.996 --> 02:50:26.198]  And their ideology has a survival instinct.
[02:50:26.938 --> 02:50:33.843]  And that's the key here that I actually broke down with Doug Hagman yesterday in the war room, is that the reason why they're engaged in such
[02:50:34.964 --> 02:50:35.605]  We're good to go.
[02:50:52.984 --> 02:50:56.805]  Though I don't like to call it that, close quote The View, they're saying we're making it up.
[02:50:57.005 --> 02:50:57.746]  They still deny it.
[02:50:58.186 --> 02:51:00.046]  Adam Schiff on Twitter, Eric Swalwell on Twitter.
[02:51:00.086 --> 02:51:02.227]  There was no spying, it's fake news from the right.
[02:51:02.247 --> 02:51:06.188]  And it's like, wait a second, we just got that from James Clapper, even though we already knew that was going on.
[02:51:06.528 --> 02:51:08.769]  But it's all a survival instinct.
[02:51:08.789 --> 02:51:14.611]  They know that they're against the ropes, and they know that if Trump isn't defeated or removed from office, that they're done.
[02:51:15.231 --> 02:51:24.855]  Their stranglehold over the country, the communist, socialist, whatever you want to call it, that they try to bring this government down with, is in dire straits right now.
[02:51:24.895 --> 02:51:25.515]  Absolutely.
[02:51:25.915 --> 02:51:27.756]  And I wanted Sawman on the last segment.
[02:51:27.836 --> 02:51:28.836]  They got him on a little bit earlier.
[02:51:28.856 --> 02:51:30.116]  I want to get him back on, guys.
[02:51:30.477 --> 02:51:35.678]  And I want to get the Congressional Medal of Honor thing that was done on Fox yesterday, because we're going to air that before this show ends.
[02:51:36.259 --> 02:51:36.499]  I'm going to...
[02:51:37.279 --> 02:51:38.780]  Countermand or that's not the word.
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:41.582]  I'm going to commandeer some of the next hour.
[02:51:41.982 --> 02:51:44.564]  So just I'm telegraphing that to everybody because that's about enough.
[02:51:44.584 --> 02:51:46.465]  If you want to play the full thing, it's about 20 minutes.
[02:51:47.185 --> 02:51:49.507]  The full entire presentation.
[02:51:49.607 --> 02:51:50.407]  So you carried it?
[02:51:51.088 --> 02:51:51.508]  I've got it.
[02:51:51.588 --> 02:51:53.249]  I've got it queued up to play on the war room.
[02:51:53.869 --> 02:51:55.991]  OK, well, I want to play just some of it here then when he gives it.
[02:51:56.731 --> 02:51:58.672]  Because Obama got rid of this.
[02:51:58.892 --> 02:51:59.853]  Well, think about this, Alex.
[02:51:59.873 --> 02:52:02.174]  Like you said, you didn't see this yesterday.
[02:52:02.194 --> 02:52:03.995]  It really didn't get much TV coverage.
[02:52:04.015 --> 02:52:05.696]  I mean, very little coverage in the Medal of Honor.
[02:52:06.016 --> 02:52:09.317]  I remember when Obama handed out any award, it was a huge TV event.
[02:52:09.357 --> 02:52:10.698]  They had the whole camera crews there.
[02:52:10.738 --> 02:52:11.679]  Everybody made a big deal of it.
[02:52:11.699 --> 02:52:12.999]  But Trump hands out a Medal of Honor.
[02:52:13.039 --> 02:52:15.300]  It seems like nobody even bats an eye.
[02:52:15.521 --> 02:52:18.322]  Just like the MS-13 roundtable, nobody bats an eye.
[02:52:18.342 --> 02:52:20.203]  That was an incredibly powerful event.
[02:52:20.603 --> 02:52:29.251]  Just like the Republicans and a 50-minute public presser announcing that it's time for a special counsel in the Clinton email investigation and the origins of the Trump resolution.
[02:52:29.291 --> 02:52:30.433]  You keep publishing, I'll be back.
[02:52:30.473 --> 02:52:32.454]  These things just get no coverage.
[02:52:33.415 --> 02:52:34.657]  These things get no coverage.
[02:52:36.018 --> 02:52:38.140]  And it's just incredible to think why.
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:39.661]  Why wouldn't somebody cover
[02:52:40.842 --> 02:52:45.865]  An MS-13 roundtable where they come out with the news, and this is, I mean, this is huge, right?
[02:52:45.905 --> 02:52:49.047]  I mean, why wouldn't anybody be talking about gangs?
[02:52:49.407 --> 02:52:54.109]  We're talking about gangs that murder, rape, traffic in children, etc.
[02:52:54.470 --> 02:52:55.690]  Sell drugs, all of it.
[02:52:56.391 --> 02:52:57.571]  Violent gangs.
[02:52:59.392 --> 02:53:02.694]  Sneaking into this country using children.
[02:53:03.755 --> 02:53:06.016]  Using children to get in.
[02:53:06.676 --> 02:53:09.158]  It's just like, people don't take what we say seriously.
[02:53:10.035 --> 02:53:12.418]  MS-13 knows how to get around the system.
[02:53:13.540 --> 02:53:14.941]  That's not just rhetoric.
[02:53:15.682 --> 02:53:21.690]  It's pretty simple to figure out, oh okay, if I come in with a kid or two, they're gonna let me in!
[02:53:22.793 --> 02:53:24.514]  Wow, MS-13 has a brain too.
[02:53:24.935 --> 02:53:28.397]  They bring in the kids with their gang members, and then what do you have?
[02:53:28.577 --> 02:53:31.519]  Unaccompanied children in the country that we have to take care of.
[02:53:31.940 --> 02:53:36.143]  And this is totally ignored by mainstream press, even though it should be top news.
[02:53:36.723 --> 02:53:37.864]  And let me expand on that.
[02:53:38.525 --> 02:53:40.866]  MS-13 is the most hated in Mexico.
[02:53:41.727 --> 02:53:43.128]  Because they're out of El Salvador.
[02:53:43.688 --> 02:53:45.149]  They're literally devil worshippers.
[02:53:45.189 --> 02:53:51.592]  They're the worst gang in... They set the precedent back 15 years ago or so to start killing kids.
[02:53:52.253 --> 02:53:55.835]  Nobody would kill kids in any Latin American gang because they had some basic chivalry.
[02:53:57.015 --> 02:54:00.977]  Now they're killing kids, something previously only Muslims would do on purpose.
[02:54:01.578 --> 02:54:03.479]  So, I mean, these guys are worse than animals.
[02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:05.620]  Animals kill for food.
[02:54:06.872 --> 02:54:07.913]  Animals kill to survive.
[02:54:07.953 --> 02:54:12.998]  These people do it because it's a cult of who can be the nastiest, meanest, most disgusting person.
[02:54:13.819 --> 02:54:17.242]  And, you know, these are the guys that are running the coyote operations.
[02:54:17.283 --> 02:54:24.990]  These are the guys that are so ruthless, they're taking over the Mexican gangs, and then the Mexican gangs are adopting their psychology.
[02:54:25.290 --> 02:54:26.552]  When we got 150 million Mexicans in Mexico,
[02:54:28.914 --> 02:54:31.255]  And you've got probably 20, 30 million illegals here.
[02:54:31.615 --> 02:54:33.236]  You don't want them adopting this.
[02:54:33.256 --> 02:54:36.377]  I mean, this is like adopting Nazism or something.
[02:54:36.737 --> 02:54:41.179]  And the president simply says this, and they go, how dare you?
[02:54:41.199 --> 02:54:42.820]  You're saying Hispanics are animals.
[02:54:43.340 --> 02:54:47.122]  But let me just make a comment real quick on the animals thing, okay?
[02:54:48.822 --> 02:54:51.545]  The entire left freaks out over Trump saying animals.
[02:54:52.306 --> 02:54:55.148]  Wait a second, you claim we're animals through evolution.
[02:54:55.469 --> 02:54:58.672]  So they literally teach in science that we're animals.
[02:54:58.872 --> 02:54:59.993]  That's their science.
[02:55:00.273 --> 02:55:03.136]  They want their science that teaches we're animals.
[02:55:03.156 --> 02:55:03.757]  Of course, of course.
[02:55:03.777 --> 02:55:04.798]  Babies aren't even humans.
[02:55:04.838 --> 02:55:05.338]  Chop them up.
[02:55:05.819 --> 02:55:09.462]  But then Trump says animals, speaking of gang members, and they throw their hands in the air.
[02:55:09.482 --> 02:55:10.923]  They're chopping babies up.
[02:55:11.684 --> 02:55:14.085]  But now they're saying everyone has the spark of divinity.
[02:55:14.345 --> 02:55:15.485]  These are God's children.
[02:55:15.765 --> 02:55:17.386]  They said, oh, well, Pelosi didn't mean them.
[02:55:17.626 --> 02:55:21.947]  Then a bunch of Democrats come out and they go, no, we mean MS-13, including Juan Williams.
[02:55:22.367 --> 02:55:23.127]  Let me add this.
[02:55:23.288 --> 02:55:27.169]  That's why I'm saying everybody points their fingers at Michael Rotondo.
[02:55:28.409 --> 02:55:30.990]  And they go, look, this guy's the biggest bum in the galaxy.
[02:55:32.196 --> 02:55:34.477]  And I think he's got some quirky, you know, issues.
[02:55:34.497 --> 02:55:35.857]  I don't think he's a bad guy.
[02:55:35.877 --> 02:55:37.338]  I think he's been, you know, shut in.
[02:55:37.658 --> 02:55:48.481]  He's nothing compared to making us pay for MS-13 to bring women in who have babies by design to give them an anchor in the United States to bring up to 10 more people in.
[02:55:48.781 --> 02:55:54.483]  We're paying for MS-13 women to have babies on record to pay for everything for them.
[02:55:54.823 --> 02:55:56.204]  That is BS!
[02:55:57.219 --> 02:56:04.262]  And this is what a welfare state does, and even though its intentions may be good, even though the intentions of whatever... But it's not at the top.
[02:56:04.322 --> 02:56:05.303]  You read LBJ.
[02:56:05.523 --> 02:56:06.844]  He said the blacks are getting... But it never works.
[02:56:06.864 --> 02:56:07.304]  These are quotes.
[02:56:07.864 --> 02:56:09.905]  I don't even want to say the quotes because they'll edit it in SassEdit.
[02:56:10.205 --> 02:56:11.426]  He said blacks are getting uppity.
[02:56:13.254 --> 02:56:17.258]  Because they oppressed them so they created their own economies and in some areas were getting wealthier than whites.
[02:56:17.278 --> 02:56:18.539]  It's like Kanye West now, too.
[02:56:18.559 --> 02:56:19.680]  You know, he's getting a little uppity.
[02:56:19.700 --> 02:56:21.262]  They need to, you know, send him back to the Middle East.
[02:56:21.322 --> 02:56:21.722]  Exactly.
[02:56:21.762 --> 02:56:22.283]  Listen, folks.

[02:57:19.111 --> 02:57:20.572]  This is the biggest special ever.
[02:57:21.491 --> 02:57:23.891]  On Storable Food and Infowarstore.com.

[02:58:00.451 --> 02:58:01.531]  I believe in you!
[02:58:01.951 --> 02:58:07.734]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:58:08.074 --> 02:58:12.355]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:58:12.495 --> 02:58:13.676]  And we're not backing down, ever!
[02:58:15.945 --> 02:58:16.745]  Get these people!
[02:58:16.806 --> 02:58:17.326]  We're winning!
[02:58:17.366 --> 02:58:18.466]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:58:18.627 --> 02:58:19.067]  Can't you?
[02:58:19.087 --> 02:58:21.008]  We have broken their back!
[02:58:21.368 --> 02:58:22.309]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:58:22.329 --> 02:58:24.870]  Let's go!
[02:58:25.190 --> 02:58:27.171]  Come on!

[02:58:52.740 --> 02:58:58.003]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:58:58.724 --> 02:59:02.026]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:59:02.886 --> 02:59:09.130]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:59:10.911 --> 02:59:17.253]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:59:18.053 --> 02:59:23.294]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:59:23.914 --> 02:59:39.938]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, makaroo from Peru, horny goatweed from China,
[02:59:41.018 --> 02:59:44.881]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:09.258 --> 03:00:10.899]  Hitler took the guns.
[03:00:10.959 --> 03:00:13.260]  Stalin took the guns.
[03:00:13.320 --> 03:00:16.661]  Mao took the guns.
[03:00:16.741 --> 03:00:19.282]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[03:00:19.362 --> 03:00:22.344]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[03:00:40.292 --> 03:00:43.640]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[03:00:45.745 --> 03:00:48.752]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[03:01:02.350 --> 03:01:03.931]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:01:04.272 --> 03:01:10.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:15.161]  We got some really bad news.
[03:01:15.221 --> 03:01:21.186]  That's why Owen originally an hour ago showed up to tell me and then he saw the guest we had on and we had him on about that.
[03:01:21.207 --> 03:01:22.287]  There's been so much breaking.
[03:01:23.789 --> 03:01:24.790]  Tommy Robinson
[03:01:26.124 --> 03:01:28.166]  That Patriot exposed the Islamic invasion.
[03:01:28.486 --> 03:01:36.772]  You know Count Dankula is facing up to a year in prison for doing a Hitler dog joke, something John Cleese and many others have done.
[03:01:37.752 --> 03:01:39.994]  Tommy Robinson arrested, but now there's more.
[03:01:40.775 --> 03:01:52.323]  Arrested while filming outside grooming trials in Leeds, where they've caught the police en masse in the government literally helping groom little girls for sex slavery, some that have died.
[03:01:52.763 --> 03:01:54.925]  And they're saying he's facing 13 months in prison.
[03:01:57.113 --> 03:02:02.677]  Wow, so, and we're going to go to Roger Stone for the rest of this segment and one more, and then taking over as Joel Gilbert.
[03:02:02.757 --> 03:02:03.638]  He's loaded for bear.
[03:02:03.658 --> 03:02:11.243]  And then you're going to start your three-hour special broadcast on Veterans Day with Sawman co-hosting with you coming up.
[03:02:11.263 --> 03:02:12.444]  But I mean, this is a big deal.
[03:02:13.064 --> 03:02:15.925]  I mean, a year in jail for making a pug Nazi joke?
[03:02:16.365 --> 03:02:20.887]  I made the same joke about my late French bulldog because he didn't have hair on this part of his nose that was black.
[03:02:21.248 --> 03:02:21.808]  This was white.
[03:02:21.908 --> 03:02:24.989]  And I said, you know, Hitler dog, will he be banned?
[03:02:25.049 --> 03:02:26.950]  Well, in England, I would face a year in prison.
[03:02:27.530 --> 03:02:28.531]  I just can't believe this.
[03:02:29.371 --> 03:02:31.232]  You know, what has happened to free speech?
[03:02:31.272 --> 03:02:33.793]  What has happened to the principles of free speech?
[03:02:34.073 --> 03:02:36.236]  What has happened to the left that used to stand for free speech?
[03:02:36.637 --> 03:02:39.341]  I mean, this used to be something that the right and the left could come together on.
[03:02:39.361 --> 03:02:43.227]  They're making their move with the judiciary and Trump and others have got to break the back of it.
[03:02:44.246 --> 03:02:52.830]  Well, I mean, you know that everything... Basically, if you want to see what America, on the path it's on, look at China, they're about 100 years ahead of us.
[03:02:52.870 --> 03:02:54.470]  Look at Europe, they're about 10 years ahead of us.
[03:02:54.830 --> 03:02:58.392]  So this is 10 years away from America if we don't do something about it right now.
[03:02:58.552 --> 03:02:59.492]  I think it's sooner than that.
[03:02:59.532 --> 03:03:01.993]  I think if Hillary would have gotten in... Oh, well, then it'd be today.
[03:03:02.133 --> 03:03:02.474]  Well, yeah.
[03:03:02.974 --> 03:03:03.994]  It'd be accelerated.
[03:03:04.815 --> 03:03:10.297]  For example, Alex, I'd go broadcast from the school shooting in Santa Fe where you sent me to go broadcast.
[03:03:10.477 --> 03:03:11.657]  They'd shut me down and probably arrest me.
[03:03:11.757 --> 03:03:12.518]  Because of Sandy Hook.
[03:03:13.479 --> 03:03:14.119]  That's what they'd say.
[03:03:14.159 --> 03:03:15.680]  They'd say, oh, you're out here bullying victims.
[03:03:15.700 --> 03:03:16.240]  They'd shut me down.
[03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:16.960]  They'd probably arrest me.
[03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:20.861]  You had a woman walk over and say that we got people killed in Pizzagate.
[03:03:21.001 --> 03:03:21.541]  Totally made up.
[03:03:21.601 --> 03:03:23.062]  Which, again... Don't even die.
[03:03:23.262 --> 03:03:25.202]  And that's one out of the 50 people I talked to.
[03:03:25.222 --> 03:03:25.662]  So it's sad.
[03:03:25.702 --> 03:03:26.403]  It's a fringe element.
[03:03:26.423 --> 03:03:29.003]  But yeah, I mean... But they're more and more in control of the system.
[03:03:29.203 --> 03:03:30.284]  And they want me to leave.
[03:03:30.324 --> 03:03:31.664]  They're saying, you're not allowed to be here.
[03:03:31.924 --> 03:03:34.465]  And it's like, I'm not even talking about politics or anything.
[03:03:34.565 --> 03:03:35.345]  I'm just here to talk.
[03:03:35.405 --> 03:03:38.726]  You very tastefully talked to eyewitnesses and interviewed families.
[03:03:39.306 --> 03:03:41.588]  And we live in Texas, and we're news, and we're allowed to do it.
[03:03:41.768 --> 03:03:46.612]  And then you had MSNBC who tried to push their political agenda upon the people they were interviewing.
[03:03:46.692 --> 03:03:47.652]  They couldn't get the interviews.
[03:03:47.973 --> 03:03:50.555]  Oh, that video you aired, I didn't even know you got that there so much.
[03:03:50.575 --> 03:03:51.616]  You aired it a few days later.
[03:03:51.896 --> 03:03:58.161]  What's the name of that where you show MSNBC trying to go through a bunch of people to get the one view they wanted?
[03:03:58.181 --> 03:03:58.841]  Tell folks about that.
[03:03:58.881 --> 03:04:03.985]  So yesterday, well basically we put out... That's how they got the four anti-gun students in Parkland.
[03:04:04.185 --> 03:04:05.406]  They just interviewed 500 people.
[03:04:05.426 --> 03:04:06.347]  They're gonna find what they need.
[03:04:06.587 --> 03:04:08.168]  But they didn't do it in Santa Fe, Alex.
[03:04:08.268 --> 03:04:09.429]  They couldn't get it in Santa Fe.
[03:04:09.449 --> 03:04:10.570]  What's the name of that video?
[03:04:10.590 --> 03:04:12.131]  Are you talking about our video?
[03:04:12.211 --> 03:04:12.391]  Yeah.
[03:04:12.651 --> 03:04:18.515]  It's exclusive, I believe exclusive, eyewitness reports from Santa Fe High School or something.
[03:04:18.535 --> 03:04:22.478]  No, I know, but I saw you air a video, and I was like, oh my god, I want to air that tomorrow, and I forgot to do it.
[03:04:22.498 --> 03:04:23.359]  OK, that would have been yesterday.
[03:04:23.379 --> 03:04:28.202]  Where you show how they couldn't get the mainstream media to, how they couldn't get people to say they were anti-gay.
[03:04:28.222 --> 03:04:28.643]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:04:28.663 --> 03:04:30.524]  That was either two days ago in the war room.
[03:04:31.244 --> 03:04:31.965]  I'm trying to remember.
[03:04:32.005 --> 03:04:32.725]  That's the problem.
[03:04:32.765 --> 03:04:34.026]  We're breaking such bombshell stuff.
[03:04:34.046 --> 03:04:35.687]  We're in the information overload all the time here.
[03:04:37.048 --> 03:04:37.929]  It is becoming insane.
[03:04:38.009 --> 03:04:39.330]  I mean, I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[03:04:39.350 --> 03:04:51.977]  All right, Roger Stone for one second, then Joel Gilbert, always ready to take on the commies, and just absolutely expose the great goblin demon, Vladimir Putin, is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:04:52.677 --> 03:05:00.962]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us as we go in, through, and beyond!
[03:05:08.729 --> 03:05:10.790]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[03:05:11.291 --> 03:05:19.456]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[03:05:19.816 --> 03:05:22.358]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[03:05:22.778 --> 03:05:26.281]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[03:05:26.601 --> 03:05:27.682]  We need your help.
[03:05:42.023 --> 03:05:43.484]  Be one, yeah!
[03:06:13.951 --> 03:06:18.122]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:06:18.844 --> 03:06:20.208]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:39.364 --> 03:06:41.245]  Roger Stone is not going to be on the War Room today.
[03:06:41.266 --> 03:06:45.148]  He's getting some well-deserved rest with all the hundreds of interviews he's been doing.
[03:06:45.188 --> 03:06:47.870]  His wife's been in the hospital off and on, so pray for her.
[03:06:47.890 --> 03:06:55.036]  There's a Veterans Call-In Show with Owen Schroyer and Craig Sawyer, the former Dev Group Navy SEAL.
[03:06:55.076 --> 03:06:56.697]  His buddy just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.
[03:06:56.717 --> 03:06:58.698]  They're going to play some of that today.
[03:06:58.718 --> 03:07:05.503]  They're going to take veterans calls and active duty calls only to get their take on what's happening in the world and so much more.
[03:07:05.543 --> 03:07:07.305]  But I wanted to get Roger on because the Hill
[03:07:08.689 --> 03:07:23.461]  And the Associated Press reported that Mueller now admits, and they've talked to their people, that, oh, because I guess they're getting the media ready for this, we're not getting into Russiagate or collusion with Stone and the Russians, we're just going to find something financial and put him in jail.
[03:07:23.941 --> 03:07:27.725]  And then you've got Giuliani saying, we're not worried, they're not going to flip him.
[03:07:28.845 --> 03:07:31.388]  And then Rogers saying, there's nothing to flip on.
[03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:36.622]  So, again, Roger and I talked about this months ago, we talked about this weekend, we knew it was coming.
[03:07:37.163 --> 03:07:38.143]  Total vindication.
[03:07:38.783 --> 03:07:56.109]  They've got a magnifying glass, you know, aimed up every orifice here, over every molecule of his body, as he said, and I didn't even want to cut into the time that Roger has, but I wanted to have Owen ride shotgun too, for any of his side comments or takes on this, but as
[03:07:56.869 --> 03:07:58.651]  The wheels come off of this, Roger.
[03:07:59.451 --> 03:08:08.659]  It looks like you're the last gasp hope they've got and are almost telegraphing to you in the media that you just need to roll over or something really bad's gonna happen.
[03:08:08.699 --> 03:08:10.180]  So hang in there, buddy.
[03:08:10.240 --> 03:08:12.262]  This is like way beyond any movie I've ever seen.
[03:08:13.393 --> 03:08:14.894]  No, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[03:08:15.054 --> 03:08:39.415]  Having come up completely empty-handed in terms of any involvement in Russian collusion on my part, having come up empty-handed on the claim that I was trafficking in allegedly hacked emails with WikiLeaks, they now clearly hope to conjure up some extraneous offense in an effort to not only silence me, but to punish me for my advocacy of the election of Donald Trump.
[03:08:40.075 --> 03:08:59.288]  I mean, it's really disconcerting to have a runaway federal prosecutor aggressively scrutinizing, picking and probing through every aspect of your personal and professional life, deploying platoons of federal agents to conduct this microscopic, fine-toothed review of my personal life.
[03:08:59.908 --> 03:09:17.005]  Badgering at least eight of my current or former colleagues, asking questions about my private life, my business associations, my friendship and association with you, with InfoWars, just all over the map, none of it having to do with Russian collusion or the 2016 election.
[03:09:18.066 --> 03:09:21.810]  It is clear that Mr. Mueller plans to target me.
[03:09:22.450 --> 03:09:31.172]  And, of course, MSNBC and CNN, they're just giddy with these reports that my criminal indictment is imminent, even though there is no proof of that.
[03:09:32.072 --> 03:09:38.974]  And they refuse to mention, oh, by the way, this has nothing to do with Russia or WikiLeaks or John Podesta's email, and so on.
[03:09:39.354 --> 03:09:40.754]  It is really frightening.
[03:09:40.854 --> 03:09:42.974]  It's Big Brother writ large.
[03:09:43.094 --> 03:09:45.235]  It's the deep state gone amok.
[03:09:47.074 --> 03:09:49.336]  And they're obviously on their last legs.
[03:09:49.396 --> 03:09:58.344]  Even mainstream media has to admit that Trump is winning, the economy's coming back, that they've been covering up, they've been lying, Congress is honing in on them.
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:01.482]  Is there any way they can pull a rabbit out of their hat?
[03:10:01.642 --> 03:10:19.741]  Because when I told you last weekend, I mean I said it on air, Mueller's specialty, and I sent you a news article showing this, is when they've botched investigations, when they've been caught, when they're desperate, when they're covering up, they bring in Mueller, they set somebody up, they say they're to blame, and they kill them within one day of saying they're the person that did it.
[03:10:20.402 --> 03:10:23.265]  And I'm serious, you've already been shot in your backyard.
[03:10:23.305 --> 03:10:25.748]  People make jokes about it all, like, what is this, a James Bond movie?
[03:10:25.768 --> 03:10:32.055]  Yeah, you're at the center of the total fight for the country in a Russiagate spy operation.
[03:10:32.816 --> 03:10:33.697]  They shoot you with a...
[03:10:35.339 --> 03:10:40.745]  You know, radioactive polonium dart, which again are gelatin, so they dissolve.
[03:10:41.125 --> 03:10:43.828]  It doesn't go all the way into your body because it goes into your shirt.
[03:10:44.228 --> 03:10:47.211]  You know, you said what your nephew was out there when this happened.
[03:10:47.331 --> 03:10:47.552]  BAM!
[03:10:47.572 --> 03:10:48.192]  They're like, what is that?
[03:10:48.212 --> 03:10:48.713]  You're bleeding.
[03:10:49.173 --> 03:10:50.214]  And then you got tested.
[03:10:50.274 --> 03:10:53.498]  The feds asked you not to release it in the hospital, but I think you should.
[03:10:53.518 --> 03:10:55.440]  I know the feds came and threatened the hospital.
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:10:56.261]  You should release that.
[03:10:56.301 --> 03:10:57.242]  I know you got T-boned.
[03:10:58.163 --> 03:10:59.224]  Uh, and this is what they do.
[03:10:59.344 --> 03:11:08.738]  Mueller kills who he's going... I know your wife didn't like hearing that, and I'm... I don't want to say it's my fault she's been in the hospital, but you did say she got pretty freaked out when she heard the show.
[03:11:08.998 --> 03:11:10.140]  She knows I don't lie about stuff.
[03:11:10.360 --> 03:11:13.584]  But I think it's for your safety we say that Mueller is a murderer.
[03:11:14.045 --> 03:11:15.006]  Mueller is a criminal.
[03:11:15.026 --> 03:11:16.046]  He covered up 9-11.
[03:11:16.547 --> 03:11:20.850]  They clearly, from the evidence of my sources, killed the third Patsy in the anthrax case.
[03:11:21.510 --> 03:11:23.171]  They have a long history of this crap.
[03:11:23.571 --> 03:11:29.655]  And so I'm saying by exposing that, you were the one that said they were trying to kill you so they could then set you up a year ago.
[03:11:29.736 --> 03:11:30.896]  You know this yourself.
[03:11:31.197 --> 03:11:33.178]  So I'm only saying what you already know, Roger.
[03:11:34.499 --> 03:11:41.063]  Well, Alex, first of all, I think we all recognize an unbridled federal prosecutor can literally indict a ham sandwich.
[03:11:41.263 --> 03:11:43.625]  But I have no interest in being Mr. Mueller's lunch.
[03:11:44.680 --> 03:11:52.550]  Secondarily, if anything does happen to me, I will be a martyr for the cause, and you can talk about it extensively here at InfoWars.
[03:11:53.051 --> 03:11:55.394]  I have no intention of ruling on this president.
[03:11:55.894 --> 03:12:00.260]  I have no negative information with which I could damage him.
[03:12:00.880 --> 03:12:00.980]  Yes.
[03:12:17.256 --> 03:12:18.017]  We're good to go.
[03:12:37.695 --> 03:12:56.709]  Very soon we will be unveiling the Infowars Legal Defense Fund because you're facing the same kind of BS lawsuits, harassment lawsuits that are being used to malign you, to smear you, to drive you into bankruptcy because they're expensive even though they're harassment-oriented and frivolous.
[03:12:56.869 --> 03:12:58.691]  And we're just not going to stand for it.
[03:12:58.791 --> 03:13:00.332]  We are going to fight.
[03:13:00.532 --> 03:13:04.957]  Well, I've talked to the lawyers and the experts, and they totally agree these are all lawfare deals.
[03:13:05.418 --> 03:13:08.421]  But with enough of them, it can start to have the desired effect.
[03:13:08.441 --> 03:13:09.382]  That's what listeners have to understand.
[03:13:09.823 --> 03:13:10.964]  We're not just saying this.
[03:13:11.004 --> 03:13:12.706]  We're up against the Clinton crime network.
[03:13:12.986 --> 03:13:14.168]  People asked us to fight them.
[03:13:14.288 --> 03:13:14.828]  I fought them.
[03:13:15.609 --> 03:13:22.611]  I'm not complaining, I'm not bitching, but if you want your champions to continue on, they need to see millions and millions.
[03:13:22.931 --> 03:13:24.712]  Millions of dollars weren't what they used to be, okay?
[03:13:25.072 --> 03:13:32.934]  Satellites, crew, people, legal, law... There's more than 12 active lawsuits against us right now.
[03:13:32.974 --> 03:13:34.115]  As fast as we knock them down...
[03:13:34.975 --> 03:13:35.876]  They put new ones in.
[03:13:36.276 --> 03:13:39.539]  But by the grace of God, Weinstein's going to jail.
[03:13:40.100 --> 03:13:44.043]  He's part of the larger network of pedophiles, we know, through the Alita Express.
[03:13:44.784 --> 03:13:46.345]  This is going to bring them all down.
[03:13:46.406 --> 03:13:50.129]  It's why they're fighting for their lives, because it's a death battle, Roger.
[03:13:50.369 --> 03:13:55.514]  So yes, we need to have a big focus fundraiser next week, because I've learned, if I just kind of ask here or ask there, it doesn't do anything.
[03:13:55.774 --> 03:14:03.780]  We'd have a big beat the drum, lay it out, expose it, extravaganza, so get your butt to Texas as soon as you can to launch this thing next Thursday.
[03:14:03.800 --> 03:14:05.621]  We're doing a 34-hour broadcast.
[03:14:05.661 --> 03:14:08.683]  If none of your wife's from the hospital, we'll do it remote, my friend.
[03:14:08.943 --> 03:14:09.924]  Owen Schroer, your comments.
[03:14:10.882 --> 03:14:22.073]  Well, and I think that if they saw the audience support us even more in the face of these lawsuits, they'd be less inclined to actually go with them because it's all measurements with them.
[03:14:22.113 --> 03:14:25.356]  It's all measuring how they can bring you down or get in your head or whatever.
[03:14:25.576 --> 03:14:26.197]  It's like Caputo.
[03:14:26.217 --> 03:14:27.538]  He was going to have to sell his house.
[03:14:27.939 --> 03:14:29.420]  As soon as he got the support, they kind of backed off.
[03:14:29.540 --> 03:14:29.940]  Exactly.
[03:14:30.201 --> 03:14:48.718]  So if they saw that all of a sudden in the face of these lawsuits that InfoWars just got massive amounts of, you know, purchases at InfoWarsStore.com, you know, record purchases at InfoWarsStore.com as they continued about these lawsuits, I think that that might back them off because now they're realizing that, uh-oh, we're actually making InfoWars bigger by attacking them like this.
[03:14:48.758 --> 03:14:50.019]  The Streisand effect is real.
[03:14:50.259 --> 03:14:50.639]  Exactly.
[03:14:50.699 --> 03:14:53.521]  Imagine if you had a chance to go back and be in the second American Revolution.
[03:14:53.801 --> 03:14:54.441]  This is it.
[03:14:54.601 --> 03:14:55.402]  We're delivering.
[03:14:55.702 --> 03:14:56.262]  It's happening.
[03:14:56.302 --> 03:14:57.163]  The enemy knows.
[03:14:57.663 --> 03:14:58.844]  And they're trying to destroy us.
[03:14:58.904 --> 03:15:00.445]  So, InfoWarStore.com.

[03:15:08.709 --> 03:15:11.891]  Roger, you're going to be back on the War Room on Tuesday.
[03:15:12.291 --> 03:15:14.833]  I'll be live hosting on Sunday.
[03:15:14.853 --> 03:15:16.734]  You'll be back next week as well.
[03:15:17.054 --> 03:15:18.855]  Thank you so much, Roger, and Godspeed.
[03:15:19.488 --> 03:15:22.410]  Well, people ask me how I feel and whether I'm concerned.
[03:15:22.891 --> 03:15:26.294]  I've seen this attack on you and smearing you on the Sandy Hook matter.
[03:15:26.754 --> 03:15:29.076]  That really, really aggravates me.
[03:15:29.136 --> 03:15:32.459]  We're in this together and we're not going to stop fighting.
[03:15:32.519 --> 03:15:33.880]  We will not be silenced.
[03:15:34.160 --> 03:15:37.523]  We will not be kneecapped.
[03:15:37.803 --> 03:15:38.664]  We're ready to fight.
[03:15:38.744 --> 03:15:42.427]  But we can't do it without the help of the InfoWars audience.
[03:15:43.103 --> 03:15:45.105]  I mean, they're like the blood in our arteries.
[03:15:45.125 --> 03:15:49.688]  When they give, when they spread the word, they overpower the censors, they financially defeat the enemy.
[03:15:50.008 --> 03:15:51.129]  We are our listeners.
[03:15:51.329 --> 03:15:52.270]  We are our supporters.
[03:15:52.290 --> 03:15:55.292]  So, yes, take advantage of the record sales at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:15:55.592 --> 03:16:01.417]  All right, Owen, get ready, because you're going to be hosting the special Veterans War Room with Sawman coming up.
[03:16:01.437 --> 03:16:02.177]  But first, Joel Gilmore.
[03:16:02.517 --> 03:16:04.699]  This stuff's made in New York City!
[03:16:05.420 --> 03:16:06.721]  New York City!
[03:16:07.455 --> 03:16:07.935]  Get a rope.
[03:16:08.115 --> 03:16:09.156]  I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
[03:16:09.236 --> 03:16:09.937]  You're hurting my elbow.
[03:16:10.057 --> 03:16:11.578]  I'm Larry Carroll in Los Angeles.
[03:16:11.618 --> 03:16:16.981]  The Los Angeles County District Attorney has just filed murder charges against Orenthal James O.J.
[03:16:17.021 --> 03:16:22.225]  Simpson in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and 25-year-old Ronald Coleman.
[03:16:22.325 --> 03:16:23.926]  Football Hall of Famer O.J.
[03:16:23.986 --> 03:16:27.508]  Simpson is questioned in the murders of his ex-wife and a male companion.
[03:16:27.568 --> 03:16:31.249]  Let's return to Tom Brokaw for a report on the still-developing O.J.
[03:16:31.269 --> 03:16:31.890]  Simpson story.
[03:16:31.910 --> 03:16:33.950]  And here's Tom at our Manhattan studios.
[03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.210]  Tom?
[03:16:34.851 --> 03:16:42.013]  Bob, we are witnessing tonight a modern tragedy and drama of Shakespearean proportion being played out live on television.
[03:16:42.073 --> 03:16:43.674]  Police believe that O.J.
[03:16:43.694 --> 03:16:44.774]  Simpson is in that car.
[03:16:44.794 --> 03:16:46.054]  He appears to be at this time O.J.
[03:16:46.074 --> 03:16:46.495]  Simpson.
[03:16:46.515 --> 03:16:47.735]  He's in the back of the vehicle.
[03:16:47.755 --> 03:16:50.596]  He has a gun to his head and he says he will hurt himself.
[03:16:50.616 --> 03:16:53.117]  He is demanding to be taken to his mother.
[03:16:53.157 --> 03:16:53.857]  O.J., you there?
[03:16:54.497 --> 03:16:56.058]  Oh, uh...
[03:16:56.838 --> 03:16:57.718]  And nobody's gonna get hurt.
[03:16:57.778 --> 03:16:59.459]  I've already said goodbye to my kids.
[03:16:59.799 --> 03:17:00.519]  You can't take this.
[03:17:00.699 --> 03:17:01.500]  Oh yes you can.
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:02.540]  Yes you can.
[03:17:02.960 --> 03:17:10.222]  Lots of people at the overpass, at Sunset.
[03:17:10.242 --> 03:17:11.002]  Get rid of the gun.
[03:17:11.022 --> 03:17:11.683]  I'm gonna leave.
[03:17:11.703 --> 03:17:12.623]  I'm just gonna do it.
[03:17:12.643 --> 03:17:13.903]  I'm just gonna call it.
[03:17:13.943 --> 03:17:14.864]  That's all I'm gonna do.
[03:17:14.904 --> 03:17:16.004]  That's all I'm gonna do.
[03:17:16.044 --> 03:17:20.945]  There's a crowd of people who are on the bridge here watching as he approaches the Sunset Boulevard.
[03:17:21.005 --> 03:17:22.786]  All right, everything's clear.
[03:17:22.886 --> 03:17:25.887]  And now making his left turn westbound on Sunset Boulevard.
[03:17:26.247 --> 03:17:27.588]  He must have gone right by you, Aaron.
[03:17:27.628 --> 03:17:28.388]  Well, he hasn't.
[03:17:28.428 --> 03:17:29.429]  We're staying ahead of him.
[03:17:29.469 --> 03:17:35.993]  We're going to his mansion, believing that he's going there, but it was an amazing situation on that overpass there.
[03:17:36.033 --> 03:17:38.194]  There were people running around on top of there.
[03:17:38.634 --> 03:17:41.196]  I don't know how he's going to be able to drive through all those people.
[03:17:41.316 --> 03:17:43.797]  Okay, he's getting off at Sunset Blvd.
[03:17:43.977 --> 03:17:46.319]  off the 405.
[03:17:46.399 --> 03:17:48.240]  Hello, Jay?
[03:17:49.440 --> 03:17:51.962]  Mr. Simpson, would you please stand and face the jury?
[03:17:54.082 --> 03:18:09.101]  We, the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Orenthal James Simpson, not guilty of the crime of murder in violation of penal code section 187A, a felony upon Nicole Brown Simpson, a human being, as charged in Part 1 of the information.
[03:18:25.276 --> 03:18:39.484]  We, the jury, in the above-entitled action, find the defendant, Orenthal James Simpson, not guilty of the crime of murder in violation of Penal Code Section 187A, a felony upon Ronald Lyle Goldman, a human being, as charged in Count 2 of the information.
[03:19:11.232 --> 03:19:13.773]  To maintain a certain image.
[03:19:13.933 --> 03:19:18.835]  Nicole didn't come out.
[03:19:19.055 --> 03:19:23.657]  And we started having words about who is this guy, why is he here, what's going on.
[03:19:23.778 --> 03:19:26.519]  And she says, this is my house, get the F out of here.
[03:19:26.859 --> 03:19:31.581]  As things got heated, I just remember Nicole fell and hurt herself.
[03:19:31.621 --> 03:19:33.762]  This guy kind of got into a karate thing.
[03:19:33.902 --> 03:19:35.583]  And I said, well, you think you can kick my ass?
[03:19:35.663 --> 03:19:36.803]  And I remember I grabbed a knife.
[03:19:37.003 --> 03:19:37.984]  And to be honest,
[03:19:39.239 --> 03:19:44.103]  After that I don't remember, except I'm standing there and there's all kind of blood and stuff around.
[03:19:44.583 --> 03:20:00.636]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the Resistance.
[03:20:06.158 --> 03:20:09.020]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.221 --> 03:20:16.044]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:16.124 --> 03:20:20.567]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:36.027 --> 03:20:38.390]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:42.194]  I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from the left coast.
[03:20:42.294 --> 03:20:46.198]  Don't forget to check out my new film in the Alex Jones Store.
[03:20:47.480 --> 03:20:48.321]  Art of the Insult.
[03:20:48.361 --> 03:20:49.422]  Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:20:50.325 --> 03:20:52.627]  We're going to be taking calls later today.
[03:20:52.667 --> 03:20:53.808]  You might want to start dialing.
[03:20:53.868 --> 03:20:59.412]  It's going to be a very famous guest, Hollywood icon, writer and director Lionel Chet.
[03:20:59.432 --> 03:21:06.658]  When coming up in a few minutes, we're going to talk about Harvey Weinstein and the liberal bias in Hollywood, what it's all about.
[03:21:07.518 --> 03:21:14.884]  From the iconic director who's been telling stories of freedom and the American way for many, many years, right in the heart of liberal Hollywood.
[03:21:15.645 --> 03:21:17.166]  The phone number is going to be 1-877-789-8111.
[03:21:21.752 --> 03:21:24.795]  2539, that's 1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:21:25.596 --> 03:21:31.020]  Now before we bring up Lionel Chetwynd, I want to talk about what is now known as Spygate.
[03:21:31.260 --> 03:21:50.156]  All this time, we find out, after all this time, that the Department of Justice, the FBI, CIA, orchestrated an effort to steal the election for Obama's party, the Radical Socialist Democrats, and keep Hillary in office so that Obama's fundamental transformation of America could be complete.
[03:21:51.050 --> 03:21:54.951]  Now what people are not talking about is that Spygate is nothing new.
[03:21:55.791 --> 03:21:58.132]  People forget that Obama did it back in 2012.
[03:21:59.132 --> 03:22:03.393]  He stole the election using government agencies, using the IRS.
[03:22:04.013 --> 03:22:10.934]  Let's take a quick look at the video of Obama talking about IRS interference and let's see if we can see if he's lying.
[03:22:10.974 --> 03:22:11.534]  Let's take a look.
[03:22:15.468 --> 03:22:28.193]  If IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous.
[03:22:28.673 --> 03:22:31.174]  They have to be held fully accountable.
[03:22:31.315 --> 03:22:37.317]  You don't want the IRS ever being perceived
[03:22:38.081 --> 03:22:42.064]  To be biased and anything less than neutral in terms of how they operate.
[03:22:42.565 --> 03:22:47.589]  I will not tolerate it and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this.
[03:22:49.330 --> 03:22:52.853]  Okay, so gee, do you think maybe Obama is lying through his teeth and he knew about it?
[03:22:52.953 --> 03:22:57.256]  The IRS, head of the IRS visited the White House 500 times.
[03:22:57.777 --> 03:23:00.139]  Lois Lerner pleads the fifth.
[03:23:00.959 --> 03:23:02.661]  So this has been going on for years.
[03:23:03.541 --> 03:23:06.504]  And this is the way that Obama operated his police state.
[03:23:07.230 --> 03:23:18.974]  It wasn't that five guys at the FBI and my old high school friend Bruce Orr, that I went to high school with, they didn't wake up and say, hey, let's commit a bunch of felonies and treason and we'll try to get Hillary elected.
[03:23:19.554 --> 03:23:21.855]  This was years of police state activity.
[03:23:22.275 --> 03:23:24.015]  It was a natural thing for Obama.
[03:23:24.535 --> 03:23:34.479]  Fast and Furious, spying on the Associated Press, spying on Fox News' James Rosen, John Brennan, the CIA, spying on the Senate Committee, Intelligence Committee.
[03:23:36.590 --> 03:23:44.296]  People remember that, look, after two years of Obama, from 2008 to 2010, the public knew they'd been had.
[03:23:44.436 --> 03:23:46.318]  This guy was not who he says he was.
[03:23:46.958 --> 03:23:49.881]  His agenda was not what he said it would be.
[03:23:50.041 --> 03:23:51.822]  He was not going to cut the deficit in half.
[03:23:52.363 --> 03:23:55.826]  It was not the most transparent government in history.
[03:23:56.386 --> 03:23:58.748]  They could see he was pro-Russia, pro-Iranian,
[03:24:01.255 --> 03:24:02.515]  Uh, Muslim extremist groups.
[03:24:03.155 --> 03:24:05.376]  So the Tea Party movement arose across the country.
[03:24:05.396 --> 03:24:12.737]  They swept the Democrats out of power in 2010, and they were poised to easily remove Obama in 2012 to get rid of him.
[03:24:13.477 --> 03:24:15.298]  The public knew he had lied about everything.
[03:24:16.238 --> 03:24:18.758]  Uh, so Obama used the police state.
[03:24:18.838 --> 03:24:21.879]  He used the IRS to crush the conservative Tea Party movement.
[03:24:22.599 --> 03:24:26.740]  They couldn't organize for the 2012 election while the left was allowed to organize.
[03:24:27.060 --> 03:24:28.620]  And that's all we actually even know about.
[03:24:29.637 --> 03:24:32.958]  So, by comparison, let me tell you what a police state is.
[03:24:33.458 --> 03:24:36.299]  I experienced it when I visited Russia in 1983.
[03:24:36.619 --> 03:24:38.259]  This was the height of the Cold War.
[03:24:38.899 --> 03:24:43.080]  Andropov was the former head of the KGB, was president of the Soviet Union.
[03:24:43.860 --> 03:24:47.901]  And I went on a tour of Russia, and I also visited families who were trying to leave Russia.
[03:24:48.742 --> 03:24:53.903]  And the first thing you notice when you get into Soviet Communist Russia is it's like backwards world.
[03:24:53.923 --> 03:24:54.743]  There's no food.
[03:24:55.443 --> 03:24:57.264]  Even if you have money, there's nothing to buy.
[03:24:57.324 --> 03:24:58.284]  The stores are empty.
[03:24:59.167 --> 03:25:06.574]  There's only one model of a car with four different colors, and it's like a horror movie from 1984, you know, Orwell.
[03:25:07.455 --> 03:25:08.596]  And everything is opposite.
[03:25:08.636 --> 03:25:11.358]  The Russian media says everything the opposite of the truth.
[03:25:11.438 --> 03:25:12.419]  Communism is great.
[03:25:12.820 --> 03:25:13.981]  Free markets are bad.
[03:25:14.601 --> 03:25:15.862]  America is oppressive.
[03:25:16.503 --> 03:25:18.024]  Americans are starving to death.
[03:25:19.025 --> 03:25:22.849]  So the Russian media and the communist officials, all they did was lie.
[03:25:23.556 --> 03:25:30.821]  Now, this kind of reminds you of the mainstream media today, Adam Schiff, Chuck Schumer, when they move their lips, they're lying.
[03:25:31.621 --> 03:25:32.782]  Now, what happened to me in Russia?
[03:25:32.882 --> 03:25:38.306]  When I arrived at the airport, I got held for 12 hours and questioned all night long because I was an American.
[03:25:39.267 --> 03:25:46.752]  I was followed around by, I don't know who, militia, as I walked around Moscow and Leningrad, as I visited different families.
[03:25:47.052 --> 03:25:53.256]  When I took a taxi, two guys followed in a red car, and I was visiting someone who was arrested.
[03:25:53.979 --> 03:25:55.260]  Now, this was the police state.
[03:25:56.380 --> 03:25:57.380]  Now, what happened to me in 2012?
[03:25:58.541 --> 03:25:59.621]  Can you believe it's America?
[03:25:59.661 --> 03:26:00.942]  I flew into Washington, D.C.
[03:26:00.962 --> 03:26:05.123]  for CPAC, and I was told not to get off the plane by the co-pilot.
[03:26:05.643 --> 03:26:07.984]  Four police officers come and escort me off the plane.
[03:26:08.004 --> 03:26:12.726]  They ask me about my films that I've produced, and I kind of just laughed, and they eventually let me go.
[03:26:12.746 --> 03:26:22.510]  The next time I'm in D.C., the Capitol Police follow me when I leave my hotel, the car, and pull me over, check my ID, and let me go.
[03:26:23.365 --> 03:26:27.887]  The IRS opens a five-year-old tax returns and denies all my business expenses.
[03:26:28.768 --> 03:26:32.010]  A leftist reporter working for George Soros hacks my bank account.
[03:26:32.750 --> 03:26:46.237]  So, people that have been opposing Obama and revealing the truth, Dinesh D'Souza, others, we've experienced the police state not too much different from my 1983 visit to the Soviet Union.
[03:26:48.246 --> 03:26:56.233]  Does anybody really believe that if Hillary had been elected, 10,000 votes in a couple of swing states, that there would ever be another free election?
[03:26:57.474 --> 03:27:00.476]  Now, in a police state, if you go along with the program, you don't have a problem.
[03:27:00.516 --> 03:27:01.056]  No problem.
[03:27:01.717 --> 03:27:13.206]  But if you oppose socialism, if you say this isn't working out, the economy is crashing, all the inner cities are getting worse, if you point out their hypocrisy, the police state comes after you.
[03:27:14.107 --> 03:27:17.550]  So we're seeing the last vestiges of the police state.
[03:27:18.594 --> 03:27:30.799]  Obama did everything he could to stay in power in 2012, and he used the entire tools of state, FBI, DOJ, and they're still not finished with it with this special counsel.
[03:27:32.019 --> 03:27:37.401]  And their goal is to restore the Democrat police state, because Democrat and liberal policies don't work.
[03:27:37.661 --> 03:27:39.902]  Socialism does not work.
[03:27:39.982 --> 03:27:42.203]  The only way they can maintain power in history
[03:27:42.919 --> 03:27:52.347]  Is to use force, whether it's the government agencies, the gulag, the actual police to haul you off of airplanes.
[03:27:53.168 --> 03:28:04.377]  And I don't know that anyone completely understands, and everyone should understand, how close the United States as a republic, as a constitutional government, came to coming to a permanent end.
[03:28:04.857 --> 03:28:10.642]  And that's why myself, Infowars Alex Jones, people like Jerome Corsi, of course Roger Stone,
[03:28:11.616 --> 03:28:12.176]  So many others.
[03:28:12.216 --> 03:28:19.339]  We fought so hard to bring information to the public and show what the Obama police state was really all about.
[03:28:20.060 --> 03:28:38.067]  My film, Dreams of My Real Father, I demonstrated that Obama's real father was a Soviet agent and that Obama was radicalized into this Marxist worldview that held that Americans are deplorable and they must be controlled and guided toward socialism.

[03:30:01.827 --> 03:30:06.288]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:14.392]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[03:30:14.772 --> 03:30:16.373]  But here's what you want to know.
[03:30:17.363 --> 03:30:23.306]  You want to go to mfulmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[03:30:23.986 --> 03:30:27.528]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[03:30:28.408 --> 03:30:36.412]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[03:30:36.992 --> 03:30:44.656]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[03:30:45.456 --> 03:30:49.226]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[03:30:49.787 --> 03:30:50.609]  It's Alpha Power.
[03:30:50.649 --> 03:30:53.757]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[03:30:54.828 --> 03:31:09.696]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[03:31:10.116 --> 03:31:15.479]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[03:31:15.779 --> 03:31:17.320]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[03:31:17.620 --> 03:31:18.961]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[03:31:18.981 --> 03:31:23.565]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpha Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[03:31:24.105 --> 03:31:28.428]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[03:31:28.448 --> 03:31:29.769]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[03:31:30.610 --> 03:31:36.814]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[03:31:37.215 --> 03:31:39.276]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[03:31:39.857 --> 03:31:41.438]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[03:31:41.458 --> 03:31:42.799]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[03:31:42.839 --> 03:31:44.280]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[03:31:47.202 --> 03:31:48.043]  But here's an example.
[03:31:48.864 --> 03:31:56.450]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[03:31:56.470 --> 03:31:58.192]  It just has a little bit in it.
[03:31:58.652 --> 03:32:04.817]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[03:32:05.498 --> 03:32:10.604]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[03:32:10.885 --> 03:32:19.235]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[03:32:19.635 --> 03:32:20.656]  Nobody else does that.
[03:32:20.736 --> 03:32:23.400]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[03:32:23.920 --> 03:32:40.056]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[03:32:40.476 --> 03:32:49.418]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[03:32:49.438 --> 03:32:51.799]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[03:32:52.179 --> 03:32:57.660]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA-253-3139.
[03:32:57.700 --> 03:32:58.300]  A total 360 win.
[03:32:58.340 --> 03:32:59.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.308 --> 03:33:27.694]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.162 --> 03:33:34.042]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:34.422 --> 03:33:36.743]  Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast.
[03:33:37.503 --> 03:33:40.904]  You know me from my recent film, of course, it's Trump the Art of the Insult.
[03:33:41.184 --> 03:33:46.425]  Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones Store, support InfoWars and get this great new film.
[03:33:46.445 --> 03:33:49.765]  I'm going to be taking some calls shortly for my guest.
[03:33:50.045 --> 03:33:50.726]  It's going to be 1-877-789-2539.
[03:33:50.746 --> 03:33:51.006]  That's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:33:59.505 --> 03:34:03.847]  My guest is the iconic Hollywood film director and writer.
[03:34:04.468 --> 03:34:12.092]  He's known for such films as Miracle on Ice, Hanoi Hilton, Ruby Ridge, Kissinger, Nixon, so many more films.
[03:34:12.632 --> 03:34:16.334]  He was one of the founders of the Hollywood conservative group Friends of Abe.
[03:34:16.354 --> 03:34:20.296]  Let's take a quick look at some movie clips to remind you of Lionel's films.
[03:34:25.498 --> 03:34:26.459]  There were 20 of them.
[03:34:27.580 --> 03:34:29.224]  They didn't know how they were gonna do it.
[03:34:30.047 --> 03:34:31.531]  But they knew they wanted to win.
[03:34:31.551 --> 03:34:31.731]  Okay.
[03:34:49.016 --> 03:34:53.180]  Just a few of the films from Lionel Chatwin joining us now from the Hollywood Hills.
[03:34:54.101 --> 03:34:55.423]  Lionel, welcome to InfoWars.
[03:34:56.084 --> 03:34:57.125]  I'm very happy to be here.
[03:34:57.185 --> 03:34:57.985]  Thanks for having me, Joel.
[03:34:59.167 --> 03:35:10.679]  OK, well, before we get into the Hollywood left liberal bias and everything going on in Hollywood, today Harvey Weinstein was finally brought into court.
[03:35:11.440 --> 03:35:14.121]  Can you give us some perspective being in Hollywood all this time?
[03:35:14.141 --> 03:35:16.222]  Does the Me Too movement have it right?
[03:35:16.423 --> 03:35:21.005]  Or is there more to this scenario than people really understand?
[03:35:22.526 --> 03:35:31.410]  Well, you know, Hollywood, the entertainment business generally, has always been something of a twilight in terms of morality, in terms of the way people interact.
[03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:33.291]  It's just in the nature of the beast.
[03:35:34.852 --> 03:35:37.573]  And clearly there is abuse.
[03:35:37.593 --> 03:35:39.114]  Abusive attitudes of
[03:35:40.173 --> 03:35:41.214]  People towards one another.
[03:35:42.114 --> 03:35:45.015]  But it has less to do with gender than what would be led to believe.
[03:35:46.436 --> 03:35:54.900]  When in the very beginning of my career, most of the people for whom I worked were men, development executives and development was largely male preserved.
[03:35:55.420 --> 03:35:58.381]  By the 1990s, it was almost universally women.
[03:36:00.022 --> 03:36:03.823]  And I mean, there are all kinds of stories at two levels.
[03:36:04.424 --> 03:36:07.365]  One are women in power who exploited that power
[03:36:08.401 --> 03:36:11.943]  To enhance their entertainment, or however you'd like to say that.
[03:36:12.683 --> 03:36:20.606]  And so the abusive behavior in Hollywood is not only a function of gender, it's really a function of power.
[03:36:21.066 --> 03:36:30.090]  And those who are in power will tend to exploit that power for their own pleasure, enjoyment, or whatever.
[03:36:30.630 --> 03:36:36.373]  The other thing is, you'll hear this from people who have
[03:36:37.310 --> 03:36:39.871]  One person in particular had a hilarious story.
[03:36:39.931 --> 03:36:41.071]  They weren't hilarious, actually.
[03:36:41.591 --> 03:36:53.955]  But during the casting sessions for programs, women, young women, particularly the shows that were headed or aimed at a younger audience, they'd come into audition and they'd do what's called the Sharon Stone.
[03:36:53.995 --> 03:37:02.398]  You know, they'd flash, sending a clear message of availability should the right thing turn out.
[03:37:02.438 --> 03:37:02.578]  So
[03:37:03.656 --> 03:37:07.359]  So, the sexual abuse is real, it's dehumanizing, it's unpleasant.
[03:37:09.400 --> 03:37:18.387]  I know many men, including myself when I was younger and looked a little better, and was in better shape, I suppose, who have experienced it on the other side.
[03:37:19.048 --> 03:37:21.149]  So, it's endemic.
[03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:27.634]  I'm glad they're catching up to thugs like Harvey Weinstein, because Harvey is a thug, was a thug, and everyone knew he was a thug.
[03:37:27.994 --> 03:37:30.176]  The only person I ever saw up to him, actually, was Brad Pitt.
[03:37:30.979 --> 03:37:32.200]  Okay, well, as a
[03:38:00.423 --> 03:38:11.675]  You're known as a filmmaker who's told these great American stories of freedom, trying to explain the stories of American heroism and courage and American values for many years.
[03:38:12.276 --> 03:38:18.643]  What have you been up against in Hollywood in the past, you know, in your career, and has it gotten worse?
[03:38:18.683 --> 03:38:22.426]  Are these stories true that liberals and the left don't want to hear?
[03:38:23.187 --> 03:38:28.009]  Conservatives' points of view or conservative films, even if it would make them a ton of money.
[03:38:28.189 --> 03:38:29.529]  Can you give us the background?
[03:38:29.589 --> 03:38:40.672]  Yeah, I think there are various reasons why the liberal point of view prevailed in spite of the fact that it was really counterintuitive in terms of the economic interest in the studios.
[03:38:43.193 --> 03:38:45.374]  The problem today are the streaming services.
[03:38:46.468 --> 03:38:53.313]  Netflix, and Amazon, Hulu, and some of the newer channel stars, and so on and so forth.
[03:38:53.893 --> 03:38:55.874]  They're concerned with their business, not ratings.
[03:38:56.214 --> 03:38:59.036]  Ratings no longer kind of generate in that world.
[03:38:59.096 --> 03:39:00.117]  It's what they call churn.
[03:39:00.617 --> 03:39:05.760]  And churn is a number of people, the difference between the number of people who sign on in a month and the number of people that don't sign on.
[03:39:06.180 --> 03:39:10.403]  And if you've got more people signing on than quitting, then you have a positive churn if more quit them.
[03:39:11.003 --> 03:39:13.625]  And so they feel the best way to improve their churn
[03:39:14.863 --> 03:39:17.405]  is to win awards.
[03:39:17.785 --> 03:39:33.395]  So the objective of much of the programming on Netflix, Showtime and all of these outlets is to win an Emmy or if they could get a qualifying release to win an Oscar or to be nominated or to get, you know, that kind of publicity during award season.
[03:39:33.415 --> 03:39:34.716]  They feel that will attract people.
[03:39:35.317 --> 03:39:40.260]  Well, of course, the only way you can get those awards is by catering to that very small audience.
[03:39:40.896 --> 03:39:52.269]  The Academy, when I've been in the Academy for a very long time, my first produced film, The Apprenticeship of Denny Kravitz, I got an Oscar nomination, so I've been a member ever since.
[03:39:53.070 --> 03:39:57.715]  But the Academy, two years ago, after the Oscar So White campaign,
[03:39:58.576 --> 03:40:02.379]  The Board of Governors simply decided there was no debate, there was no vote, there was no notice.
[03:40:02.760 --> 03:40:10.566]  Just one day in the mail, in the email comes a notice, we have decided that all people over a certain age can no longer vote.
[03:40:11.267 --> 03:40:14.009]  Anyone who's not had a credit in 10 years or a significant
[03:40:14.611 --> 03:40:22.992]  The role in 10 years is out of the organization in terms of voting, and we will create a new group of voting associate members.
[03:40:23.032 --> 03:40:24.313]  The first three were women.
[03:40:25.853 --> 03:40:27.113]  All three wore hijabs.
[03:40:27.573 --> 03:40:33.934]  One had never made a film, as I recall, but said that she wanted to be a filmmaker, and being a member of the Academy would no doubt help.
[03:40:34.754 --> 03:40:38.915]  I'm not sure about that, but, you know, so it was done by FIAT.
[03:40:39.375 --> 03:40:43.216]  So the control of what is measured
[03:40:43.937 --> 03:40:57.272]  A success by the members of the industry very much drives the new end users, and that's very left wing.
[03:40:58.133 --> 03:40:59.434]  In that sense, it's much worse.
[03:40:59.835 --> 03:41:03.098]  In the 80s, I was actually openly backlisted by
[03:41:04.734 --> 03:41:17.184]  HBO, the head of production there, told—I was on the lot at what was then Lorimer, and so three Lorimer producers independently went in and talked about having me do something.
[03:41:17.204 --> 03:41:23.870]  They said, oh no, he's a conservative, and therefore he cannot write caring women or gay men.
[03:41:24.577 --> 03:41:25.838]  We're gay women and caring women.
[03:41:25.858 --> 03:41:26.518]  It was one or the other.
[03:41:26.538 --> 03:41:27.138]  I'm not quite sure.
[03:41:27.918 --> 03:41:35.181]  They're very open about it, that I was a conservative and as far as they were concerned, that disqualified me from being employed by
[03:41:37.952 --> 03:41:38.312]  HBO.
[03:41:38.653 --> 03:41:39.793]  I confronted them on this.
[03:41:40.313 --> 03:41:43.254]  They became very concerned, and I told them, don't worry, I'm not suing you.
[03:41:43.855 --> 03:41:44.595]  I'm a conservative.
[03:41:44.635 --> 03:41:45.815]  We don't have any tort lawyers.
[03:41:46.636 --> 03:41:48.496]  They failed to see the humor in that.
[03:41:49.277 --> 03:41:51.398]  But eventually, of course, they did hire me again.
[03:41:52.698 --> 03:41:54.679]  And I got some awards for them.
[03:41:54.739 --> 03:41:56.420]  So I guess they thought it was okay.
[03:41:56.440 --> 03:42:00.181]  But now there's no open blacklisting of that sort.
[03:42:01.582 --> 03:42:02.182]  But there is
[03:42:03.875 --> 03:42:13.142]  A very stiff whitelisting process that goes on, which is much more insidious and much more dangerous, much more anti-democratic than a blacklist.
[03:42:13.162 --> 03:42:14.443]  Because a blacklist you can confront.
[03:42:15.124 --> 03:42:16.064]  You can do what I did.
[03:42:16.084 --> 03:42:20.868]  It's just that they meet with me and just confront them and embarrass them.
[03:42:20.988 --> 03:42:21.769]  It was a lot of fun.
[03:42:22.830 --> 03:42:25.192]  One of my better days at the entertainment business.
[03:42:25.712 --> 03:42:28.054]  But you can't do that with a whitelist, you see.
[03:42:28.855 --> 03:42:32.798]  A whitelist is really a list of who's employable as opposed to who's not employable.
[03:42:34.967 --> 03:42:39.409]  We're going to come back in a couple minutes.
[03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:40.349]  We've got another segment.
[03:42:40.369 --> 03:42:44.190]  We'll take some phone calls with Lionel Chetwynd from the Hollywood Hills.

[03:44:11.055 --> 03:44:11.815]  This is a human!
[03:44:11.995 --> 03:44:12.976]  This is what we look like!
[03:44:13.196 --> 03:44:14.316]  This is what we act like!
[03:44:14.877 --> 03:44:16.337]  This is what everybody was like before us!
[03:44:16.737 --> 03:44:17.538]  This is what I am!
[03:44:17.558 --> 03:44:18.518]  I'm a throwback!
[03:44:18.538 --> 03:44:19.258]  I'm here!
[03:44:19.599 --> 03:44:21.079]  I've got the fire of human liberty!
[03:44:21.259 --> 03:44:22.580]  I'm setting fires everywhere!
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:24.361]  And humans are turning on everywhere!
[03:44:24.381 --> 03:44:27.862]  And we're gonna get our metaphysical hands around your stinking necks!
[03:44:28.142 --> 03:44:29.443]  Make no mistake, parasites!
[03:44:40.564 --> 03:44:41.394]  It's fun.
[03:45:06.320 --> 03:45:08.141]  We have the best halogen out there.
[03:45:08.381 --> 03:45:10.282]  X2 is from a deep earth crystal source.
[03:45:10.382 --> 03:45:13.884]  All the other iodine is bound, meaning you don't absorb very much of it.
[03:45:14.545 --> 03:45:16.186]  People have great results with this.
[03:45:16.486 --> 03:45:17.466]  It's the good halogen.
[03:45:17.586 --> 03:45:19.047]  Research the bad halogens.
[03:45:19.087 --> 03:45:20.568]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[03:45:20.628 --> 03:45:23.350]  Read the 6,000 plus reviews.
[03:45:23.650 --> 03:45:24.210]  4.8 stars.
[03:45:24.811 --> 03:45:26.632]  98% rating by Power Reviews.
[03:45:26.692 --> 03:45:28.573]  This has changed so many people's lives.
[03:45:28.653 --> 03:45:28.833]  Yes.
[03:45:29.193 --> 03:45:30.134]  It is amazing.
[03:45:30.194 --> 03:45:33.677]  And when you don't have the good halogen, folks, the bad halogens get into your glands.
[03:45:33.697 --> 03:45:35.378]  It totally changes your whole system.
[03:45:35.478 --> 03:45:36.439]  Experience it for yourself.
[03:45:36.479 --> 03:45:39.421]  A lot of people detox in about three weeks, so be careful when you're on it.
[03:45:39.461 --> 03:45:42.103]  I would take it slow, take about a half dose the first month or so.
[03:45:42.123 --> 03:45:45.666]  It made me lazy, though, because I used to work out really hard and weigh 30, 40 more pounds.
[03:45:45.786 --> 03:45:48.628]  As soon as I went on this, I just don't have to work out as much anymore, and I don't
[03:45:48.908 --> 03:45:53.910]  Get fat, even though I'm older, just because of what it did to my whole system, my whole metabolic system.
[03:45:53.950 --> 03:45:55.770]  My skin, everything got healthier.
[03:45:55.851 --> 03:45:56.851]  My hair got healthier.
[03:45:56.931 --> 03:46:00.412]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:01.032 --> 03:46:09.475]  And again, those of you that are financially supporting us, you're breaking the back of the globalists and Soros and Hillary and all their garbage and their lawsuits and Google trying to delist us.
[03:46:09.816 --> 03:46:13.237]  You are overpowering them when you share the links, the articles.
[03:46:13.897 --> 03:46:21.948]  Person-to-person, mouth-to-mouth, ear-to-ear, you are breaking their attempt to have an iron curtain come down across this country.
[03:46:22.369 --> 03:46:23.651]  But they are pressing hard.
[03:46:23.671 --> 03:46:28.778]  It's a very dangerous game because it's exposing their tyranny to everyone.
[03:46:29.078 --> 03:46:30.981]  And Trump is beginning to move against them.
[03:46:31.141 --> 03:46:33.221]  We've got to keep him in there to do that, and he's got to know.
[03:46:33.301 --> 03:46:39.883]  They're shutting down the grassroots that is 90% of Trump's power ahead of the midterms.
[03:46:39.943 --> 03:46:45.204]  They are coming, not just for Trump, for the First Amendment now, and I cannot raise the alarm enough.
[03:46:45.484 --> 03:46:48.665]  They think you're just going to incrementally censor, you're going to get sick of hearing about it, just go to sleep.
[03:46:48.785 --> 03:46:55.826]  Folks, they've been persecuting the churches, they've been persecuting the veterans groups, they've been persecuting anybody that's a patriot, and now they're going to the next level.
[03:46:55.866 --> 03:46:58.807]  We can't roll over to this intimidation or we'll lose everything!
[03:47:06.730 --> 03:47:26.775]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:28.395 --> 03:47:30.116]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:30.196 --> 03:47:32.316]  Joel Gilbert here with you from Los Angeles.
[03:47:32.676 --> 03:47:34.837]  We're going to continue with my guest, iconic
[03:47:35.652 --> 03:47:42.314]  Conservative and American storyteller, writer and film director Lionel Chetwynd.
[03:47:42.975 --> 03:47:48.156]  You know him from such famous films as Miracle on Ice, Hanoi Hilton, Ruby Ridge, so many more.
[03:47:48.176 --> 03:47:50.517]  We're going to continue with Lionel.
[03:47:51.397 --> 03:47:59.780]  Lionel, what would happen today if a lighting director would show up at a Hollywood studio wearing a Trump Make America Great Again hat?
[03:48:00.861 --> 03:48:04.362]  And why do they hate Donald Trump so much?
[03:48:06.784 --> 03:48:07.305]  Oh my.
[03:48:09.489 --> 03:48:10.551]  That's a complicated question.
[03:48:10.571 --> 03:48:16.502]  First of all, if someone showed up in a MAGA hat, probably wouldn't get by security or, I mean, that would be, it would not.
[03:48:19.210 --> 03:48:26.153]  No, I can't answer the question because it's almost beyond my imagination that anyone would do anything like that.
[03:48:26.193 --> 03:48:29.834]  I mean, it would just be so obviously in their face.
[03:48:30.955 --> 03:48:31.795]  Why do they hate Trump?
[03:48:31.835 --> 03:48:33.035]  They hate Trump for a lot of reasons.
[03:48:33.616 --> 03:48:40.578]  Number one, it's interesting that most of the sins of which they accuse him are their own sins.
[03:48:42.701 --> 03:48:44.342]  They say he's harsh on women.
[03:48:44.422 --> 03:48:45.322]  Yeah, he's harsh on women.
[03:48:46.743 --> 03:48:48.564]  He speaks in a vulgar fashion.
[03:48:49.284 --> 03:48:57.768]  The most vulgar language I've ever heard is very frequently at pitch meetings or at executives' writers' tables.
[03:48:59.168 --> 03:49:03.951]  And there's no distinction between men and women when it comes to the use of the vulgar language.
[03:49:04.431 --> 03:49:06.852]  So I think they hate him because of his success.
[03:49:07.632 --> 03:49:10.674]  In spite of being everything they pretend not to be, but in fact are.
[03:49:11.235 --> 03:49:19.860]  It's very convoluted, but if you follow me, that's... I mean... Also, he threatens.
[03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:20.861]  He's very threatening.
[03:49:21.441 --> 03:49:28.386]  They're part of an elite who exerts so much control over our daily lives in a subliminal way.
[03:49:28.446 --> 03:49:31.648]  In a very invidious way.
[03:49:32.428 --> 03:49:34.130]  In a way that George Orwell would have admired.
[03:49:34.910 --> 03:49:36.091]  And he's a disruptor.
[03:49:37.402 --> 03:49:38.843]  Not really a disruptor in turn.
[03:49:38.923 --> 03:49:40.525]  And this is why I argue with him.
[03:49:40.545 --> 03:49:41.866]  He's not really the disruptor.
[03:49:41.886 --> 03:49:52.794]  The disruption has been the incursion of the left into our daily life, and what they call progressive, which is the old word for communist, and there's a better description for what most of them really are, whether they know it or not.
[03:49:52.874 --> 03:49:56.516]  I mean, they're communists in the sense of an all-powerful state.
[03:49:58.078 --> 03:50:01.160]  And he is disrupting their disruption.
[03:50:03.013 --> 03:50:10.099]  And that's, you know, really disturbing because a career in a place like Hollywood is very fragile.
[03:50:10.119 --> 03:50:18.626]  I mean, look, if you could bring down Harvey Weinstein in half an hour, I mean, no one can imagine how powerful he once was.
[03:50:19.427 --> 03:50:22.249]  That's just an example of the fragility of success in Hollywood.
[03:50:23.554 --> 03:50:30.917]  And so a disrupter is terribly dangerous and threatening to each of them on an individual basis.
[03:50:32.218 --> 03:50:33.698]  And of course, to the community as a whole.
[03:50:35.199 --> 03:50:36.199]  Can you tell the story?
[03:50:36.279 --> 03:50:40.721]  I know you had a recent experience with your entertainment attorney for many, many years.
[03:50:42.162 --> 03:50:47.624]  How they treated you, even though you were a client for forever.
[03:50:48.925 --> 03:50:51.626]  Yeah, well, my lawyer in trusting was actually a conservative.
[03:50:52.373 --> 03:50:55.095]  He's been my lawyer for over 35 years.
[03:50:56.336 --> 03:51:06.882]  I had really done him more favors than he had done me because I was the only person actually openly supporting George W. Bush in both of his election campaigns.
[03:51:07.303 --> 03:51:16.268]  I was sort of his go-to guy in Hollywood and I arranged for George W. Bush to attend a big gala in this guy's honor.
[03:51:16.308 --> 03:51:17.809]  I did very well by this guy.
[03:51:19.430 --> 03:51:20.371]  He got him appointed to
[03:51:21.639 --> 03:51:26.822]  Or brought to Carlos' attention, his usefulness as a government appointee to several boards and so on.
[03:51:27.663 --> 03:51:32.346]  And I was summarily fired after a discussion.
[03:51:32.366 --> 03:51:35.388]  We were having lunch in a small restaurant near their law office.
[03:51:35.408 --> 03:51:38.330]  They're very powerful attorneys, the most powerful in town.
[03:51:40.391 --> 03:51:43.093]  And I had defended, actually I was defending Cruz.
[03:51:43.473 --> 03:51:44.594]  Later I defended Trump.
[03:51:45.554 --> 03:51:47.555]  And then they said, look, he took me in line.
[03:51:47.575 --> 03:51:48.776]  She said, I gotta let you go.
[03:51:48.816 --> 03:51:49.657]  He said, I love you.
[03:51:50.518 --> 03:51:52.760]  You know, it's like being dubbed, it's not me, it's you, you know?
[03:51:53.201 --> 03:51:55.182]  I'd rather it's not you, it's me.
[03:51:56.143 --> 03:52:04.831]  But they had to let me go, he said, because the other clients and the partners were not comfortable having me in the family.
[03:52:06.112 --> 03:52:10.677]  For no other reason than I openly supported Trump.
[03:52:11.077 --> 03:52:14.220]  The best thing was then they sent me back my files.
[03:52:15.443 --> 03:52:16.943]  Uh, you know, 11 boxes.
[03:52:17.624 --> 03:52:20.584]  And, um, they, uh, they then sent me the bill.
[03:52:21.145 --> 03:52:23.005]  They sent me the bill from the transport company.
[03:52:23.285 --> 03:52:25.326]  And I, I, I wrote it back.
[03:52:26.066 --> 03:52:26.306]  Yeah.
[03:52:26.426 --> 03:52:32.167]  In China, you know, the, they would send a bill to the families and the executor for the cost of the bullet to kill their relative.
[03:52:32.507 --> 03:52:34.188]  I said, you fired me, you pay the bill.
[03:52:34.548 --> 03:52:35.708]  I've not heard from him since.
[03:52:35.948 --> 03:52:38.109]  Did they buy you, did they buy you lunch at least?
[03:52:38.129 --> 03:52:39.069]  Did they pay for that lunch?
[03:52:39.952 --> 03:52:41.453]  Well, they did, but it was the worst lunch I've ever had.
[03:52:41.473 --> 03:52:42.374]  It was undercooked.
[03:52:42.454 --> 03:52:44.075]  I almost felt he talked to the chef.
[03:52:44.796 --> 03:52:49.220]  It was nothing but an undercooked Alfredo, you know.
[03:52:50.201 --> 03:52:52.162]  Let's take a call from Will in California.
[03:52:52.182 --> 03:52:53.924]  He wants to ask about the Hanoi Hilton.
[03:52:53.964 --> 03:52:55.765]  Let's go with Will in California.
[03:52:55.805 --> 03:52:57.366]  Go ahead, for Lionel Chetwin.
[03:52:58.588 --> 03:52:59.628]  Hello, Mr. Chetwin.
[03:52:59.688 --> 03:53:00.149]  How are you?
[03:53:00.889 --> 03:53:01.410]  I'm well, Will.
[03:53:01.450 --> 03:53:01.790]  How are you?
[03:53:02.771 --> 03:53:03.091]  Great.
[03:53:03.672 --> 03:53:05.013]  I was fortunate enough to
[03:53:05.612 --> 03:53:05.832]  Yeah.
[03:53:34.967 --> 03:53:35.547]  Am I correct?
[03:53:35.627 --> 03:53:35.928]  Was that?
[03:53:36.868 --> 03:53:39.129]  Yes.
[03:53:40.310 --> 03:53:43.471]  Yeah, Jeffrey Jones.
[03:53:43.571 --> 03:53:48.834]  And I know that something happened with him and he was accused of pedophilia.
[03:53:49.394 --> 03:53:54.437]  Do you know about the way it was rampant back then as opposed to now?
[03:53:54.797 --> 03:54:02.101]  The difference between if you knew anything was going on back then versus what you know now?
[03:54:04.261 --> 03:54:04.921]  Okay, thank you.
[03:54:05.061 --> 03:54:05.841]  Thank you for the call.
[03:54:06.442 --> 03:54:07.922]  Lionel, two things.
[03:54:08.942 --> 03:54:12.763]  Do they handle sensitive cases any differently now and then?
[03:54:13.624 --> 03:54:20.526]  And my follow-up question is, can you or someone else make a major film like Hanoi Hilton in the future?
[03:54:20.546 --> 03:54:23.126]  Or is it going to be too tough to get the execs to approve it?
[03:54:24.987 --> 03:54:29.128]  Well, no, I didn't know anything.
[03:54:29.188 --> 03:54:32.109]  I mean, Jeffrey was always very, you know,
[03:54:33.236 --> 03:54:37.300]  He was a terrific guy and a wonderful actor.
[03:54:37.380 --> 03:54:44.807]  For those who can't place him immediately, he was the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as well as playing a senior officer in Hanoi Hilton.
[03:54:45.268 --> 03:54:46.669]  Could you make the Hanoi Hilton thing?
[03:54:46.729 --> 03:54:47.410]  I knew nothing about it.
[03:54:47.430 --> 03:54:52.755]  I heard about it afterward and was very disappointed in him and in what became of it.
[03:54:55.091 --> 03:54:57.532]  Could you make a film like The Hanoi Hilton?
[03:54:57.552 --> 03:54:58.592]  Do they treat it differently?
[03:54:58.612 --> 03:55:00.353]  No, I don't know.
[03:55:00.593 --> 03:55:01.313]  I really don't know.
[03:55:03.994 --> 03:55:06.014]  You know, they'll put up with drug addiction.
[03:55:06.254 --> 03:55:13.376]  You can detox, but there thus far is no acceptable detox procedure for that kind of behavior.
[03:55:13.416 --> 03:55:15.377]  And whether there should be or not, I don't know.
[03:55:15.397 --> 03:55:16.297]  It's under discussion.
[03:55:16.797 --> 03:55:18.038]  Could you make The Hanoi Hilton today?
[03:55:19.654 --> 03:55:24.480]  If you hyped up the violence, I mean, it was unfortunately a fairly violent film because it was a violent experience.
[03:55:24.900 --> 03:55:28.384]  The Conceit of Hyundai Hilton, and thank you for Will for being part of it.
[03:55:29.122 --> 03:55:32.824]  Um, was that it would be the experiences seen through the eyes of the POWs.
[03:55:33.485 --> 03:55:34.425]  I got a lot of notes.
[03:55:34.745 --> 03:55:41.329]  I had framed for our notes from ABC saying the North Vietnamese are not sympathetic enough.
[03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:42.610]  I mean, you need balance.
[03:55:43.270 --> 03:55:45.331]  Um, I said, well, it's for the POWs eyes.
[03:55:45.991 --> 03:55:47.192]  There wasn't much balance for them.
[03:55:47.872 --> 03:55:57.798]  Um, I think if, if you just made it as just a violent film, um, and stress the violence more than we tried to stress the psychological strength,
[03:55:58.562 --> 03:55:59.422]  Of our POWs.
[03:55:59.442 --> 03:56:05.264]  You know, over 10,000 Americans were taken into captivity during the Vietnam War.
[03:56:05.284 --> 03:56:06.984]  730 came home.
[03:56:07.004 --> 03:56:08.164]  730 out of at least 10,000.
[03:56:08.884 --> 03:56:12.425]  So, it was a pretty brutal experience.
[03:56:12.725 --> 03:56:20.987]  And I think if you turn it into that, but kind of made the Americans really nasty and kind of deserving of whatever they got, you might be able to do it that way.
[03:56:21.487 --> 03:56:23.568]  In fact, that was most of the critics, the liberal critics,
[03:56:24.510 --> 03:56:28.653]  Savage, the film, Stanley Kaufman in The New Republic called it filth.
[03:56:29.473 --> 03:56:31.354]  He said authentic and therefore dangerous.
[03:56:31.714 --> 03:56:33.075]  At least he acknowledged it was authentic.
[03:56:34.716 --> 03:56:42.440]  Their view was on the left that the Americans were evil murderers and the Vietnamese were, you know, put upon people.
[03:56:42.460 --> 03:56:43.941]  So if you did it from that point of view, you could make it.
[03:56:44.201 --> 03:56:45.442]  But not from the point of view I made it.
[03:56:45.502 --> 03:56:46.002]  No, no.
[03:56:46.203 --> 03:56:48.984]  They wouldn't even talk to you.
[03:56:49.164 --> 03:56:52.086]  There's a lot of kind of lip service to the military here.
[03:56:52.674 --> 03:57:00.939]  But in those days, I used to go to meetings wearing my old army field jacket with the patches still on it just to intimidate people because they'd never seen a soldier.
[03:57:01.719 --> 03:57:04.901]  You know, even one as limp as me.
[03:57:05.281 --> 03:57:05.481]  Yeah.
[03:57:06.542 --> 03:57:06.822]  Okay.
[03:57:06.962 --> 03:57:07.583]  One last question.
[03:57:07.603 --> 03:57:08.803]  We're going to have to go real quick.
[03:57:09.224 --> 03:57:13.146]  How do you feel about the new Roseanne show coming back with some conservative messages?
[03:57:14.166 --> 03:57:16.728]  I guess she's got a cross-dressing grandchild.
[03:57:16.748 --> 03:57:18.189]  What are they trying to accomplish here?
[03:57:18.209 --> 03:57:18.549]  Real quick.
[03:57:19.856 --> 03:57:26.020]  I think they're just trying to broaden the audience, and so they're paying some attention to the proclivities of Hollywood with, I think, some of that.
[03:57:26.400 --> 03:57:33.984]  Time will tell whether it drifts more to the left or whether it becomes more solid as a voice for the American working class.
[03:57:34.064 --> 03:57:35.985]  I hope it's the latter and not the former.
[03:57:37.086 --> 03:57:39.607]  Okay, Lionel Chetwin, thanks so much for all your comments.
