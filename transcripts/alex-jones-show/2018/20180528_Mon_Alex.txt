[00:00:06.428 --> 00:00:08.589]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.213]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:46.917]  We're live.
[00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:49.818]  It is Memorial Day 2018.
[00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:55.199]  I was going to take off today and go fishing with my children.
[00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.420]  I was out in the countryside at a lake in the Hill Country doing that.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.661]  But the phone calls last night and this morning, I turned my car back towards Austin and drove in the hour.
[00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:04.581]  We're here.
[00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:08.642]  We have a big rebroadcast lined up for you, but we are live.
[00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:11.803]  I have a skeleton crew of three people running the show.
[00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:13.363]  Normally takes about seven.
[00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.004]  I really appreciate Wes and Daria and Kit coming in.
[00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:22.086]  And of course, some of the other folks.
[00:01:22.726 --> 00:01:27.549]  You know, I told them, also I saw Don Salazar just showed up without even being asked to.
[00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.952]  Because the crew deserves some days off.
[00:01:31.132 --> 00:01:35.795]  But I told them all, right before we went live, I said, you know, I really love you guys.
[00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:38.336]  And they said back to me, we love you too.
[00:01:39.157 --> 00:01:40.438]  And it wasn't talk, it was real.
[00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:43.440]  And there's no place I'd rather be than here.
[00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:48.762]  And I'm proud of the things I've done, and I'd do it all over again.
[00:01:48.782 --> 00:01:53.867]  Because I've done it with a true heart, with an attempt to tell the truth, and we've changed the world together.
[00:01:54.167 --> 00:01:58.731]  And I love this audience for putting up with me over the years, because Lord knows, sometimes it's a train wreck.
[00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:01.234]  But I'm trying to go in the right direction here.
[00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:06.098]  You know about the massive demonization against Infowars.
[00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.063]  They have had, conservatively, as I looked it up,
[00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:19.751]  300,000 articles demonizing me just the last three years.
[00:02:22.712 --> 00:02:25.554]  And that's on one subject.
[00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:31.256]  Their total distortion of reality about what I said and what I've done on Sandy Hook.
[00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.298]  Because they intended to destroy me with that before they had me physically killed.
[00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:37.416]  And I know that's the program.
[00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:39.558]  That's 300,000 articles just on that.
[00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:41.599]  Every TV station, every radio station.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.142]  Thousands of articles, tens of thousands this last week.
[00:02:46.163 --> 00:02:50.386]  That is the level of propaganda you put out before you invade an innocent country.
[00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:54.725]  And it's not because I'm that important.
[00:02:54.765 --> 00:03:01.428]  It's because I've been chosen as domino number one for total destruction to then bring down the entire free press in this country.
[00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:15.876]  And that's now admitted by the Wall Street Journal three months ago, saying they're now going into high gear with their Disney merger and that the conservative leadership has met with the liberal leadership at the globalist level and decided to destroy the free press in this country and destroy Donald Trump.
[00:03:17.917 --> 00:03:18.037]  Now,
[00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:25.015]  That said, let me just boil down the news that's coming up the next hour.
[00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:30.756]  It was six people that were contacted two weeks ago we knew of.
[00:03:30.816 --> 00:03:32.116]  It was eight on Monday.
[00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:33.236]  It's 13 now.
[00:03:35.137 --> 00:03:40.218]  And the FBI is telling them, you better tell us Alex Jones is a Russian.
[00:03:41.558 --> 00:03:46.399]  You better tell us he's the mastermind getting direct orders from Trump and Roger Stone.
[00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:49.107]  And people are like, I don't even know Alex Jones.
[00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:51.008]  Most people don't even know me, never been on the show.
[00:03:51.728 --> 00:03:55.590]  Michael Caputo came on, obviously on Monday, and was the only one that was willing to talk about it.
[00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.892]  Another person's coming on today who's willing to talk about it.
[00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:00.072]  We'll tell you about that after the break.
[00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:05.355]  But this ties into the whole Tommy Robinson situation.
[00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:06.915]  We got big developments on that front.
[00:04:07.496 --> 00:04:10.557]  But the latest one is it's now two-pronged.
[00:04:10.597 --> 00:04:11.638]  They're just moving into
[00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:19.369]  Collusion that we're against Hillary and the Democrats and that there was a conspiracy in the election against her.
[00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.510]  And these FBI agents know it's all a fraud.
[00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.111]  They've just been told to create this narrative.
[00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:28.032]  I'm not even scared of being arrested or set up.
[00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:29.552]  This is their death throes.
[00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:31.433]  Politically.
[00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:36.735]  But it shows how dangerous they are and how psychotic and how out of control this breakaway state is.
[00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:38.596]  This rogue government.
[00:04:39.878 --> 00:04:40.898]  So this country's in the thick of it.
[00:04:40.958 --> 00:04:43.799]  But even Louis Farrakhan has come out and supported the president.
[00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.000]  We're going to play that clip and talk about why it's so critical.
[00:04:48.161 --> 00:04:48.901]  And so much more.
[00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.282]  We're going to connect all the dots.
[00:04:50.362 --> 00:04:53.003]  This is undoubtedly probably the most important broadcast ever.
[00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:55.023]  I say that now every few months, but this is it.
[00:04:55.403 --> 00:04:57.644]  Things are getting more serious as we go along.
[00:04:57.724 --> 00:04:59.645]  We are live, however you're watching.
[00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:01.786]  Tell folks to tune in and spread those links.
[00:05:02.006 --> 00:05:02.686]  It's an info war.
[00:05:03.406 --> 00:05:05.367]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:05:05.487 --> 00:05:05.787]  Go ahead.
[00:05:06.432 --> 00:05:08.294]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:05:08.314 --> 00:05:11.337]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.279]  It just gets old, man.
[00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.320]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.103]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:05:18.343 --> 00:05:22.347]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:24.849]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.992]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:29.474]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:30.595]  Us being shut down?
[00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:31.856]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:33.317]  You know what, Alex?
[00:05:33.357 --> 00:05:34.438]  Put him on pause again.
[00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:35.298]  Hey, Frank!
[00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:40.922]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:05:41.223 --> 00:05:45.526]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:48.608]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:05:48.628 --> 00:05:49.268]  Do you understand?
[00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:50.629]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.150]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:58.035]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:05:59.015 --> 00:05:59.696]  Do you understand?
[00:05:59.716 --> 00:06:00.897]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:06:10.672 --> 00:06:19.196]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:19.316 --> 00:06:24.539]  It has been said that
[00:06:38.263 --> 00:06:44.764]  Incredible times, perilous times, dangerous times, tumultuous times are what make men.
[00:06:45.802 --> 00:06:53.487]  Many historians have made that point that it's not so much even the individual, but it's the circumstances that make them great when they make the right decision.
[00:06:54.407 --> 00:07:07.355]  And I am quite frankly very, very proud at a fundamental level, and not in a worldly, pridely way, but just proud that I've at least stood up to the tyrants, been effective against them, and stood up to their attacks.
[00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:14.960]  And quite frankly, that they've opened up such mega-massive attacks against us, the free press, really only illustrates how right I was
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:25.088]  Twenty-three years ago when I first got on air, and the fact that, quite frankly, the only way I was wrong was not realizing just how evil our adversaries were.
[00:07:25.108 --> 00:07:31.434]  That the places I was incorrect was underestimating just how bad the rot was, just how vicious they are.
[00:07:32.307 --> 00:07:50.357]  I've started seeing bumper stickers all over Austin, I even shot some video of it yesterday, of middle class looking white people, it's white people, I've seen eight different cars, I've got video twice, with a pentagram saying hashtag resist, hashtag, and a local resistance group.
[00:07:50.457 --> 00:07:52.698]  So they're, they're decloaking right now.
[00:07:52.778 --> 00:07:56.260]  Communist marches all over, devil worshippers coming out of the woodwork.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.380]  I mean, boom!
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:57.941]  Pentagram!
[00:07:58.261 --> 00:07:58.761]  Resist!
[00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.582]  Take out Trump!
[00:07:59.802 --> 00:08:00.583]  Take out Jones!
[00:08:00.883 --> 00:08:01.443]  Take us out!
[00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:02.984]  They are uncloaking!
[00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:13.072]  Hundreds of thousands of Irish liberals got on airplanes to fly back, who were expats, but hadn't given up their citizenship to vote to kill babies.
[00:08:13.912 --> 00:08:16.414]  This is a sacrament and a religion to these people.
[00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:19.136]  The demonic evil is spreading.
[00:08:19.156 --> 00:08:20.157]  Let me give you the big announcements.
[00:08:21.838 --> 00:08:22.198]  Now, 12 people
[00:08:24.195 --> 00:08:26.655]  Milo Caputo, you know, well known all over national news.
[00:08:26.896 --> 00:08:30.376]  He came on Monday and said the FBI was particularly targeting InfoWars.
[00:08:31.596 --> 00:08:42.819]  We've now talked to others and they have specifically said that we know Jones is the mastermind with Roger Stone running the entire conspiracy with WikiLeaks in the election.
[00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:49.220]  And these people are like army officers, lawyers, campaign people.
[00:08:50.757 --> 00:08:53.018]  Car drivers that have never even met me or know me?
[00:08:53.379 --> 00:08:58.782]  And the FBI's like, we're gonna get you if you don't say Jones is the mastermind.
[00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:03.505]  I mean, I can't believe the government's even that criminal myself.
[00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:18.615]  And I talked to an army officer, who's gonna be coming on next segment, and they said, we know you go to Austin, we know you're in the room with Jones when you make those calls, we know you're cooked all this up, you know, we understand, blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:19.494 --> 00:09:21.195]  This is, reach the next level.
[00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:27.057]  Show, just like Tommy Robinson came on here a few months ago and he said, my time's limited, they're getting ready to put me in prison, they've told me.
[00:09:27.277 --> 00:09:28.197]  They're gonna kill me in prison.
[00:09:28.778 --> 00:09:31.058]  He's in prison, the judge ordered it be secret.
[00:09:31.419 --> 00:09:34.100]  There are demonstrations from Australia to Germany.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.721]  I hear some are coming today here in the US.
[00:09:37.841 --> 00:09:40.502]  Activist journalists have exposed massive pedophile rings.
[00:09:41.762 --> 00:09:45.524]  Simply went out and reported that there was a grooming trial
[00:09:47.048 --> 00:09:49.149]  Going on, and so now he's disappeared.
[00:09:49.169 --> 00:09:50.990]  Here's what Katie Hopkins had to say.
[00:09:51.510 --> 00:10:01.134]  Lest we forget, in this particular trial, 29 accused, 170 charges, 18 girls, one just 11 years old.
[00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:04.055]  Where was Swift Justice when our girls lay bleeding?
[00:10:05.353 --> 00:10:10.875]  That's just one mass gang raping case, where it turns out the police and government have been documented as protecting it for years.
[00:10:11.235 --> 00:10:14.097]  Tommy was the first person to expose this, then Katie Hopkins.
[00:10:14.877 --> 00:10:16.298]  She had to basically leave the country over it.
[00:10:16.698 --> 00:10:19.759]  They'll arrest you for even reporting this.
[00:10:20.139 --> 00:10:21.200]  And even Fox has reported.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.221]  It is illegal to report that there's even a trial?
[00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:29.282]  And it's illegal to say Tommy Robinson has even disappeared.
[00:10:29.322 --> 00:10:30.863]  This all ties in.
[00:10:30.883 --> 00:10:41.874]  And we had the exclusive yesterday with his manager, the guy that's really helped take Tommy to the next level with equipment, editing, all of it, Mr. Robertson, not Robinson, Mr. Robertson.
[00:10:41.894 --> 00:10:44.036]  He's going to give us an update today or tomorrow.
[00:10:44.517 --> 00:10:47.800]  We have more exclusive intel on that coming up of him in prison.
[00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:48.961]  He has not been attacked yet.
[00:10:49.682 --> 00:10:57.829]  They had put him in an area where he is not in solitary confinement, but he is in the corner of the prison and is basically being protected.
[00:10:57.849 --> 00:10:58.390]  Well, of course.
[00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:08.659]  They know if he gets killed now, like they tried the last few times they put him in prison, where they beat him almost half to death and tried to throw bleach on him, you know, the acid attack.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.421]  All of that, he survived.
[00:11:11.501 --> 00:11:14.284]  Now they got him in an area
[00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:18.025]  Where he won't get killed because that would really blow up in their face.
[00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:23.212]  Thousands and thousands and thousands marched, climbed the gates at 10 Downing, all over the place.
[00:11:23.272 --> 00:11:26.196]  The media had some reports, then that got delisted.
[00:11:26.216 --> 00:11:28.019]  It's called D-listed.
[00:11:29.773 --> 00:11:33.918]  To denotice, means delisted, for national security.
[00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:40.345]  It's not even a court order now, it's national security to protect the pedophiles, because they denied this was happening and now it's all breaking.
[00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:48.014]  But the Islamic groups are protected, and some of their cultures, not all Islamic culture, but some of the Pakistan, some of the North Africa, they sell people into slavery.
[00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.896]  North Africa's selling folks into slavery right now.
[00:11:51.667 --> 00:12:00.012]  Women are being sold in cages, black people are being sold in cages again, because we learned the slave trade from certain Arab slave traders 500 years ago.
[00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:01.653]  The transatlantic slave trade.
[00:12:02.834 --> 00:12:09.939]  So they got a big problem, the left does, because Hillary helped do all this, now it's unfolding, and now folks are understanding what's happening.
[00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.600]  So all this is going to tie together when we come back from break.
[00:12:14.702 --> 00:12:16.143]  Louis Faircon knows what's going on.
[00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:18.238]  Rand Paul's in on the loot.
[00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:21.841]  Louis Farrakhan invited me to his home two years ago.
[00:12:23.262 --> 00:12:25.143]  He told me, he said, I like Trump overall.
[00:12:25.183 --> 00:12:26.244]  I believe he means change.
[00:12:26.284 --> 00:12:27.184]  I believe he's an anomaly.
[00:12:27.585 --> 00:12:29.286]  I believe the establishment is out to get him.
[00:12:31.488 --> 00:12:34.750]  And he said, but then he even said some of that on tape.
[00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.592]  No media coverage because it didn't fit the narrative.
[00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:41.095]  Well, I saw the information Saturday, tweeted it out.
[00:12:41.335 --> 00:12:42.015]  It's been picked up.
[00:12:42.416 --> 00:12:43.897]  Breitbart, Drudge Reports picked it up.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:54.323]  Louis Farrakhan gave him a backhanded compliment, so he won't be destroyed like Kanye, or like they attempted, admitting that he's really helping black people and the average American.
[00:12:54.963 --> 00:12:56.364]  Because that's where this is going.
[00:12:56.784 --> 00:13:01.766]  And if Farrakhan flips on the left, and if the rest of the folks follow Kanye's example,
[00:13:02.694 --> 00:13:03.614]  The globalists are done.
[00:13:03.634 --> 00:13:08.516]  It's just like they use the Islamic vote as a block for socialism and globalism in Europe.
[00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:14.539]  Even 10% Islam wins all the elections because it throws it to whatever party sides with them.
[00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:18.441]  The black votes 90 plus percent historically for the Democrats.
[00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:19.821]  They lose that.
[00:13:20.422 --> 00:13:21.722]  They lose every election.
[00:13:22.002 --> 00:13:23.523]  The whole country goes red.
[00:13:26.604 --> 00:13:27.804]  And Farrakhan knows the truth.
[00:13:27.924 --> 00:13:33.086]  I've had three hour discussions with him and the leadership of the Nation of Islam.
[00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:35.686]  And they wanted to keep talking.
[00:13:35.746 --> 00:13:36.527]  I wasn't rude.
[00:13:36.907 --> 00:13:40.328]  I'd been up since 5 in the morning and it was like 11 at night and I said, sir, I've got to go.
[00:13:41.408 --> 00:13:46.769]  And then he invited me back up and I've just been under such globalist attack, I haven't been able to even leave Austin.
[00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:50.450]  But I do want to go meet with Farrakhan because they cut out of context what he says.
[00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.351]  I don't endorse all of it, but the guy really is smart.
[00:13:54.116 --> 00:14:01.479]  I mean, he's mega smart, incredibly eloquent, and I think in his age has really, like, wine has gotten better.
[00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:07.101]  And I didn't say much when he was talking because the guy knows what he's talking about historically, you name it.
[00:14:07.641 --> 00:14:08.481]  He is an anomaly.
[00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:10.302]  So he gets Trump as an anomaly.
[00:14:10.582 --> 00:14:17.065]  And when Louis Farrakhan comes out and starts endorsing Trump, we're going to play that clip coming up, you know it's seismic change.
[00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:22.635]  You've got globalists trying to stop the Korean peace deal.
[00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:24.157]  That's coming back like we said it would.
[00:14:25.178 --> 00:14:27.180]  We've got everything happening right now.
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:33.886]  You've got people being arrested for exposing pedophile rings because these Islamic groups are delivering it to the British aristocracy.
[00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:37.789]  They just create the holding cells, basically.
[00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.952]  They create the reservoirs, the stables.
[00:14:41.007 --> 00:14:45.550]  The Islamic term would be the harems of the little kids.
[00:14:46.331 --> 00:14:49.413]  And then the British aristocracy are the ones having sex with them.
[00:14:49.593 --> 00:14:51.174]  And that's now broke the last month.
[00:14:51.614 --> 00:14:53.456]  That's why the British government said no more.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.640]  They are shutting it all down.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.381]  So we're not just attacking Islam here.
[00:14:57.941 --> 00:15:01.702]  It's evil groups hunger for this throughout history to corrupt people.
[00:15:01.783 --> 00:15:05.464]  It's a form of Satanism to destroy the youth.
[00:15:06.184 --> 00:15:07.605]  Abortion is a form of Satanism.
[00:15:07.665 --> 00:15:11.626]  It's all about killing the life force, stealing it, snuffing out a future.
[00:15:12.306 --> 00:15:14.467]  This is the true Alistair Crowley crap we face.
[00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:20.829]  If you look at John Podesta, these top Democrats, Jay-Z, they all on record practice Crowleyian magic.
[00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:23.050]  We are fighting devil worshipers.
[00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:29.980]  I told you about the NXIVM cult and Obama and all of them six months before it broke.
[00:15:30.933 --> 00:15:36.257]  Huffington Post said, how dare Jones claim top Democrats are torturing women and branding them in cults.
[00:15:36.677 --> 00:15:37.417]  I knew all about it.
[00:15:37.497 --> 00:15:39.059]  I didn't want to be the first to get sued.
[00:15:39.539 --> 00:15:40.600]  I know a lot more.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.161]  That's why they're scared.
[00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:51.127]  And the man joining us on the other side, an army officer, who soon will reveal his identity, has been visited and basically raided by the FBI.
[00:15:51.147 --> 00:15:58.772]  The FBI is raiding people, grabbing their phones, grabbing their computers, and saying, you're going to say Alex Jones and Roger Stone are the masterminds for Trump.
[00:15:59.152 --> 00:15:59.973]  It's incredible.
[00:16:02.441 --> 00:16:08.445]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.

[00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:11.805]  This is a human!
[00:18:11.965 --> 00:18:12.946]  This is what we look like!
[00:18:13.187 --> 00:18:14.308]  This is what we act like!
[00:18:14.869 --> 00:18:16.330]  This is what everybody was like before us!
[00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:17.532]  This is what I am!
[00:18:17.552 --> 00:18:18.513]  I'm a throwback!
[00:18:18.753 --> 00:18:19.254]  I'm here!
[00:18:19.574 --> 00:18:21.076]  I've got the fire of human liberty!
[00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:22.577]  I'm setting fires everywhere!
[00:18:22.598 --> 00:18:24.380]  And humans are turning on everywhere!
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.864]  And we're gonna get our metaphysical hands around your stinking necks!
[00:18:28.144 --> 00:18:29.445]  Make no mistake, parasites!
[00:18:41.343 --> 00:18:42.432]  It's fun.
[00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:09.641]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:19:10.042 --> 00:19:17.571]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:19:17.952 --> 00:19:21.055]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:19:21.676 --> 00:19:25.937]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:19:26.297 --> 00:19:30.218]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:19:30.438 --> 00:19:33.159]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:19:33.579 --> 00:19:37.880]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:41.401]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:56.610]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free, open dialogue as a society.
[00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.231]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:19:58.411 --> 00:20:00.892]  We will prevail if you take action, and I know you will.
[00:20:06.335 --> 00:20:08.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.628]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:36.231 --> 00:20:40.939]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:46.858 --> 00:20:59.104]  All across the world on this Memorial Day weekend, people are battling authoritarian leftist governments that are arresting them for even saying they don't want open borders to radical Islam.
[00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:11.891]  Tommy Robinson, who 11 years ago first exposed massive child kidnapping sex rings that were going on right next door to his tanning salon, has spent years in prison, been tortured, attacked.
[00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:16.113]  He's back in jail for covering, just saying a trial was happening.
[00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:22.753]  Lest we forget, 29 accused, 170 charges, 18 girls, one just 11 years old.
[00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:25.975]  Where was Swift's justice when our girls lay bleeding?
[00:21:26.575 --> 00:21:28.557]  A judge has ordered no coverage of it.
[00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:36.202]  In the UK, hundreds of articles, BBC, Sky Television, that's Fox, removed it.
[00:21:39.104 --> 00:21:40.284]  Unbelievable.
[00:21:41.285 --> 00:21:43.827]  And then Tommy Robinson, incredible courage,
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:52.422]  He said, privately and on air, he said, anytime I'm scared, even though I have kids, you know, they took my house, everything from me.
[00:21:52.982 --> 00:21:58.524]  He said, I think about those little kids crying when I would see the men putting them in cars with other men to be taken away, to be raped.
[00:21:59.905 --> 00:22:08.988]  Every time he saw them, he sat there for a year until he started physically fighting them and calling the police, demanding, look, they're loading children in cars.
[00:22:09.308 --> 00:22:10.369]  He went and found their parents.
[00:22:10.609 --> 00:22:11.749]  They were all poor white people.
[00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:15.991]  And they said, we're, they'll take our kids if we, if we stop them.
[00:22:17.298 --> 00:22:18.239]  The CPS will.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.381]  Imagine a movie like that!
[00:22:21.662 --> 00:22:22.762]  And all of it's come out!
[00:22:23.103 --> 00:22:24.824]  All of it's been documented!
[00:22:25.245 --> 00:22:27.306]  Tommy wasn't a hero, he's not even a big guy!
[00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:28.307]  He's like 5'8".
[00:22:29.128 --> 00:22:32.510]  But he kicks the butt of like 6'7", 8' Antifa guys at one time.
[00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:35.393]  Because he's got Ryle on his side when they physically attack him.
[00:22:35.793 --> 00:22:37.034]  And now he's in a prison!
[00:22:38.075 --> 00:22:39.236]  And people are angry.
[00:22:39.736 --> 00:22:41.738]  And they're protesting all over the Western world.
[00:22:42.058 --> 00:22:45.201]  Because finally, the straw has broken the camel's back.
[00:22:47.452 --> 00:22:51.294]  And the pedophile rings that run the British government, the Vatican, all of it, it's all coming out.
[00:22:51.514 --> 00:22:53.515]  The Deputy Pope's being tried for pedophilia right now.
[00:22:53.755 --> 00:22:56.276]  A hundred plus traffic children, just like we see here.
[00:22:57.637 --> 00:22:58.458]  Just like this case.
[00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:04.741]  This is the cult we're facing and it's going down and it's scared.
[00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:07.902]  So I'm honored to be sued by Hillary and the Globalists and all the lies.
[00:23:08.182 --> 00:23:11.504]  I'm honored to have 300,000 plus articles against me the last two and a half years.
[00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:15.046]  I'm honored to have them because I know they're the bad guys and I'm standing against them.
[00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:32.398]  That said, I have now talked to four or five of the 13 people that the FBI has, in some cases, raided their offices, grabbed them off airplanes, grabbed them out of a parking lot and they're about to go out on a boat to go fishing yesterday in Sarasota, Florida.
[00:23:32.418 --> 00:23:34.240]  We're about to talk to that man for the rest of the hour.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.321]  Then Roger Stone's joining us.
[00:23:37.145 --> 00:23:41.508]  Saying, oh, you're a mastermind, Alex Jones is, with Roger Stone.
[00:23:41.528 --> 00:23:43.009]  You're all coordinating with each other.
[00:23:43.169 --> 00:23:47.032]  Even though I've never had Zach here, Zach's been calling in for a year and a half.
[00:23:47.312 --> 00:23:54.418]  When he laid out stuff that I got from the hostage rescue team about the Islamists and the three women in the hotel room and all the rest of it, it's now confirmed.
[00:23:54.618 --> 00:23:56.199]  They released the police reports yesterday.
[00:23:56.459 --> 00:23:58.801]  Laura Loomer reported on it for Dangerous.com.
[00:24:00.902 --> 00:24:06.892]  When he started saying stuff that I was told not to even say on air by my sources, I only gave out part of it.
[00:24:07.353 --> 00:24:08.515]  I knew he was for real.
[00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:10.158]  Then he said, yeah, I'm for real.
[00:24:10.438 --> 00:24:11.380]  Here's my real name.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.864]  Army officer, been in the news for six, seven, eight years.
[00:24:15.114 --> 00:24:21.240]  People figured out who he was on DSQ, Deep State Q. So they've outed him but tried to twist it.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.123]  The FBI has already gotten him twice before, threatened him not to come on.
[00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:27.005]  He got his lawyers yesterday.
[00:24:27.626 --> 00:24:28.467]  Lawyers came in.
[00:24:28.907 --> 00:24:29.868]  He's a prominent guy.
[00:24:30.509 --> 00:24:37.835]  And look, he's not supposed to say anything because they say, oh, you're nondisclosure, as this persona that you were involved in in PSYOPs for the U.S.
[00:24:37.875 --> 00:24:39.097]  military, domestically.
[00:24:40.009 --> 00:24:41.310]  Well, he's not getting into those PSYOPs.
[00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.170]  It doesn't get to do with me.
[00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.831]  I already know how all that works.
[00:24:44.531 --> 00:24:48.152]  He's doing this because we're down to the wire as a citizen.
[00:24:48.493 --> 00:24:52.774]  He's now been grabbed by the FBI to then be threatened to lie about me.
[00:24:53.135 --> 00:24:53.995]  He got in their face.
[00:24:54.335 --> 00:24:58.037]  So, he's going to lay it all out for you right now.
[00:24:58.097 --> 00:25:00.498]  But I want to spend a few minutes before we do in the next two segments.
[00:25:00.758 --> 00:25:01.818]  Zach, commending your courage.
[00:25:02.078 --> 00:25:03.019]  Appreciate what you're doing.
[00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.240]  Going up against the Deep State, everybody yells.
[00:25:06.451 --> 00:25:11.422]  And soon you'll reveal your full name that they already know, the globalists obviously already know, they're already after you everywhere.
[00:25:12.355 --> 00:25:17.178]  Just into the climate we're in, Farrakhan basically coming out and endorsing Trump in a backhanded move.
[00:25:17.418 --> 00:25:20.780]  He told me personally he knew the truth, but didn't know how to broach it to people.
[00:25:21.461 --> 00:25:23.342]  I had dinner with him, hung out with him all day.
[00:25:23.362 --> 00:25:25.123]  I mean, I already broke that years ago.
[00:25:25.463 --> 00:25:28.285]  We have the video, but no one will cover it, because it doesn't fit the narrative.
[00:25:28.365 --> 00:25:29.486]  Rand Paul, all of this.
[00:25:29.826 --> 00:25:30.666]  Trump's for real.
[00:25:30.906 --> 00:25:31.727]  He's a pragmatist.
[00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:32.808]  He's not out to get America.
[00:25:32.828 --> 00:25:36.450]  We've got a few minutes to break, but just how big is the historic moment
[00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.791]  We're at, as you told me this morning, you're dead right.
[00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:45.073]  All the crimes of the deep state, the criminal cabal that's been in control, they're fighting for their lives right now and it's getting crazy.
[00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:53.756]  Because again, 13 people raided by the FBI in association with Infowars.
[00:25:54.136 --> 00:25:55.776]  Infowars being one of the main topics.
[00:25:56.177 --> 00:26:00.678]  And Zach, other than Mike Caputo, came on Monday, is the only person that has the will to come on.
[00:26:00.698 --> 00:26:02.779]  I'm not blaming the others, but Zach, we appreciate you.
[00:26:02.819 --> 00:26:03.059]  Go ahead.
[00:26:06.414 --> 00:26:15.896]  Could we imagine a world where Louis Farrakhan and Alex Jones provide reason?
[00:26:16.696 --> 00:26:17.316]  How could that be?
[00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:19.756]  How could that be?
[00:26:21.217 --> 00:26:29.058]  Because we're dealing with an FBI and a DOJ that is so rogue, that is so out of control.
[00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:35.119]  The same DOJ and FBI that pulled me off the boat, that questioned me for four hours,
[00:26:36.528 --> 00:26:40.712]  And put Alex Jones at the center of the questioning.
[00:26:41.312 --> 00:26:42.333]  How could that be, Alex?
[00:26:42.373 --> 00:26:43.895]  You know you're not a mastermind.
[00:26:43.955 --> 00:26:45.836]  You know you're not doing anything.
[00:26:46.017 --> 00:26:53.964]  But in their own world, it's Alex Jones at the center of the entire cabal.
[00:26:55.203 --> 00:26:58.424]  It's Alex Jones that reached out and talked to Roger Stone.
[00:26:58.544 --> 00:27:00.824]  It's Alex Jones who won the election.
[00:27:00.944 --> 00:27:03.505]  It's Alex Jones who talked to Zach.
[00:27:03.645 --> 00:27:06.185]  It's Alex Jones who made everything happen.
[00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:07.105]  How dare you?
[00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:08.745]  How dare you?
[00:27:09.446 --> 00:27:10.166]  And how dare you?
[00:27:10.926 --> 00:27:13.266]  And I'm talking to the FBI agents right now who I talked to.
[00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:19.067]  If you want me, if you really want me, and we're in a fistfight, I'll slap you in the mouth.
[00:27:19.527 --> 00:27:22.968]  And if you're ready to put shots downrange, let's get it.
[00:27:23.973 --> 00:27:24.933]  Because I'm not having it.
[00:27:26.134 --> 00:27:27.414]  It's so problematic.
[00:27:28.695 --> 00:27:31.836]  Are we going to sit here and act like Libya didn't happen?
[00:27:31.856 --> 00:27:33.937]  9-11 didn't happen.
[00:27:34.297 --> 00:27:35.717]  Vegas didn't happen.
[00:27:36.037 --> 00:27:37.058]  You picked the wrong one.
[00:27:39.739 --> 00:27:42.860]  The conspiracy crescendo has erupted.
[00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:43.900]  Period.
[00:27:44.681 --> 00:27:48.742]  And now it's on our shoulders.
[00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:49.122]  9-11.
[00:27:51.063 --> 00:27:51.483]  Vegas.
[00:27:53.024 --> 00:27:53.344]  Libya.
[00:27:54.557 --> 00:27:55.899]  And I'm pausing on purpose.
[00:27:55.919 --> 00:27:59.484]  It has to come to fruition.
[00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:01.186]  And I will prove it.
[00:28:02.007 --> 00:28:04.811]  And if you're trying to out me, we'll see how it works.
[00:28:08.479 --> 00:28:13.020]  Well, we'll get into as much as you can with the FBI, not as your position working in the government.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:13.600]  I'm tired up, I'm sorry.
[00:28:13.881 --> 00:28:14.441]  No, I understand.
[00:28:14.861 --> 00:28:17.322]  We're not going to get into your position in the government or anything classified.
[00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:20.142]  We're just going to get into what the FBI is doing, what they're saying.
[00:28:20.202 --> 00:28:20.923]  And it's not the FBI.
[00:28:21.023 --> 00:28:25.044]  This is the rogue, as you said, criminal elements that are mad dog out of control.
[00:28:25.384 --> 00:28:29.445]  The left chose me to demonize Trump during the election, elevated me to a higher level.
[00:28:29.665 --> 00:28:36.287]  They now believe their own BS and think that I and Roger Stone, they're not sure who, run everything.
[00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:39.492]  When I talk to Trump, he just says, good job, Alex.
[00:28:39.532 --> 00:28:41.172]  Let me tell your wife how great she is.
[00:28:41.993 --> 00:28:42.633]  It's ridiculous.
[00:28:42.713 --> 00:28:44.333]  Trump is running the operation.
[00:28:45.714 --> 00:28:47.975]  Top generals are involved.
[00:28:47.995 --> 00:28:48.955]  You mean to list their names?
[00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:50.596]  You moron FBI agents?
[00:28:51.116 --> 00:28:52.116]  It's not General Flynn.
[00:28:52.536 --> 00:28:56.958]  He was sent in on a mission by the former head of the National Security Council.
[00:28:57.678 --> 00:28:58.158]  By others.
[00:28:58.758 --> 00:28:59.539]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.559 --> 00:28:59.959]  Stay with us.
[00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:10.889]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:29:11.289 --> 00:29:18.897]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:29:19.257 --> 00:29:23.561]  CNN and many others are calling for Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:29:23.901 --> 00:29:26.084]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying,
[00:29:26.644 --> 00:29:27.805]  Go beyond censorship.
[00:29:28.005 --> 00:29:30.887]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:29:31.167 --> 00:29:35.410]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:29:36.271 --> 00:29:39.313]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:29:40.254 --> 00:29:44.997]  That's why it's more important than ever that folks stay in contact with InfoWars.

[00:30:06.506 --> 00:30:09.669]  So that we have that personal, direct relationship with you.
[00:30:10.369 --> 00:30:17.031]  I was never good about email and, you know, collecting folks' email like everybody else does because I was always going for the latest cutting-edge stuff.
[00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:17.711]  We still do that.
[00:30:18.111 --> 00:30:22.113]  But all the experts have told me, Alex, if they shut everything down, it gets really bad.
[00:30:22.593 --> 00:30:31.716]  You've got to have a thumb drive with those emails so you can contact the base core of patriots that understand what's happening, the real remnant.
[00:30:32.256 --> 00:30:36.877]  Now, we're hoping for the best, ladies and gentlemen, but we're also preparing for the worst.
[00:30:37.097 --> 00:30:39.718]  That's why it's so critical, ladies and gentlemen,

[00:31:37.214 --> 00:31:41.654]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.

[00:33:06.346 --> 00:33:08.974]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:30.543 --> 00:33:34.466]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:40.371]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.793 --> 00:33:51.580]  So let me tell the FBI, since you've been raiding 13 people and bringing up myself, Roger Stone, people like Zach, who you know who he is,
[00:33:53.220 --> 00:34:01.487]  We're not part of a conspiracy like you through the Justice Department, through Strzok, through McCabe, through Comey, through the Clintons.
[00:34:02.508 --> 00:34:14.879]  We're people that read and research and know, or folks like Zach that were in Libya and saw Hillary when Gaddafi was begging to surrender for weeks before the attack, weeks during the attack, and watching black people be put in cages and sold.
[00:34:15.993 --> 00:34:24.639]  It's people like Tosh Plumley, CIA contractor, flying guns in to Al Qaeda, coming on this show, having to relocate to South America because they tried to kill him.
[00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:25.800]  That really happened.
[00:34:26.921 --> 00:34:32.625]  It's Colonel Schaefer coming on this show and having them threaten to put him in prison if he came back on and talked about Benghazi.
[00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:34.786]  He came on week one and said everything about it.
[00:34:36.047 --> 00:34:38.449]  Former head of the anti-Al Qaeda operations for the army.
[00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:40.811]  This is the real world!
[00:34:41.672 --> 00:34:56.103]  And Zach's just like one of those Colonel Schaffers, but under his contract he's not supposed to tell you his full name and who he is because he's been used in PR operations in the Middle East and for penetration of Islamic groups and takeover of Islamic groups.
[00:34:56.804 --> 00:34:57.885]  It was Zach who...
[00:34:58.516 --> 00:34:59.056]  Now we learn.
[00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:00.457]  Got us in touch with Louis Farrakhan.
[00:35:00.657 --> 00:35:02.258]  But Farrakhan wanted to meet with me two years ago.
[00:35:02.638 --> 00:35:04.319]  So that's why they're so upset about this.
[00:35:04.359 --> 00:35:08.661]  And Zach's a little freaked out today because the FBI have really been threatening him and things.
[00:35:08.701 --> 00:35:10.182]  He's not going to bow down to that stuff.
[00:35:10.582 --> 00:35:13.524]  But this is what's really going on behind the scenes, okay?
[00:35:14.184 --> 00:35:22.351]  And this is just normal people deciding, journalists, citizens, myself, Senator Paul knows what's going on, that we're not going to be part of this.
[00:35:22.872 --> 00:35:33.902]  We're done with the real deep state that states Tonkin, Kennedy's killing, 9-11, Benghazi funding radical Islam to take over regular Islamic countries and progressive Islamic countries and kill everybody?
[00:35:34.242 --> 00:35:34.502]  Really?
[00:35:34.743 --> 00:35:36.024]  Our own military said no.
[00:35:36.344 --> 00:35:37.165]  Trump has said no.
[00:35:37.245 --> 00:35:38.306]  We're taking the country back.
[00:35:39.847 --> 00:35:42.090]  So now the globalists worldwide are panicking.
[00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.754]  Now they are openly telling Zach, we don't want to hear about Russia stuff.
[00:35:45.974 --> 00:35:50.039]  What about pure collusion in the campaign against our progressivism?
[00:35:52.065 --> 00:35:58.806]  And how did Roger Stone turn Alex from being a progressive, I guess they thought because they didn't like Bush, to being this evil person?
[00:35:58.966 --> 00:36:00.147]  These people are crazy.
[00:36:00.547 --> 00:36:05.268]  They built me up as the mastermind during the campaign to hurt Trump, when I'm not the mastermind.
[00:36:05.548 --> 00:36:12.089]  I mean, I've had a big effect on air, and they've done a lot of stuff rebranding Americana, but I wouldn't say I'm the quarterback.
[00:36:12.489 --> 00:36:15.650]  Let's say I'm a star-wide receiver.
[00:36:17.011 --> 00:36:18.771]  Trump is the coach and the owner of the team.
[00:36:18.791 --> 00:36:20.112]  The American people are the owner of the team.
[00:36:20.312 --> 00:36:21.252]  Jack, I'm going to stop ranting.
[00:36:21.272 --> 00:36:23.032]  You've got the floor of this segment, the next, and the next.
[00:36:23.372 --> 00:36:25.073]  So just get into it, whatever you want to say.
[00:36:25.113 --> 00:36:25.793]  I know you're nervous.
[00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:27.693]  Lay out the big picture for folks.
[00:36:27.713 --> 00:36:28.054]  Go ahead.
[00:36:29.514 --> 00:36:30.394]  Could you imagine?
[00:36:31.374 --> 00:36:39.636]  Could you imagine that they're implying that the narrative of the entire country is waged from Austin, Texas?
[00:36:40.016 --> 00:36:40.596]  How could that be?
[00:36:42.277 --> 00:36:42.857]  Is that the case?
[00:36:44.036 --> 00:36:46.677]  Well, as you said this morning, it's not true.
[00:36:47.017 --> 00:36:48.057]  They know it's a fake narrative.
[00:36:48.077 --> 00:36:48.878]  That's what they're going to go with.
[00:36:50.398 --> 00:36:50.979]  Hold on.
[00:36:51.839 --> 00:36:57.721]  FBI agents are asking me questioning, like that is the case.
[00:36:57.941 --> 00:36:58.561]  How could that be?
[00:37:01.362 --> 00:37:03.703]  Well, you told, I mean, just go ahead and lay it out, whatever you can say.
[00:37:05.484 --> 00:37:06.224]  Could you imagine?
[00:37:06.244 --> 00:37:08.845]  FBI agents
[00:37:09.804 --> 00:37:19.690]  Implying that Alex Jones, Roger Stone, Donald J. Trump have took over America?
[00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:21.130]  Is that what's going on?
[00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:22.031]  I don't think so.
[00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:24.752]  I don't think so.
[00:37:25.593 --> 00:37:30.656]  And even my explanation to counter them seems so ridiculous.
[00:37:30.976 --> 00:37:32.397]  Because it is ridiculous.
[00:37:33.197 --> 00:37:34.338]  I will not appease them.
[00:37:35.919 --> 00:37:37.820]  I will not stop.
[00:37:38.863 --> 00:37:41.244]  If you want to come find me, we'll figure it out.
[00:37:43.144 --> 00:37:44.024]  It's bullshit.
[00:37:44.505 --> 00:37:45.745]  It's bullshit.
[00:37:45.785 --> 00:37:46.525]  We got to delay that.
[00:37:46.665 --> 00:37:47.825]  I understand you're upset, Zach.
[00:37:47.885 --> 00:37:52.267]  I've never heard you this upset, but just like we were talking this morning, because I don't even up all night.
[00:37:52.347 --> 00:37:52.687]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:52.727 --> 00:37:53.047]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:53.087 --> 00:37:53.427]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:53.627 --> 00:37:54.547]  You're right.
[00:37:54.627 --> 00:37:54.927]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:54.967 --> 00:37:55.968]  You seem really tired.
[00:37:55.988 --> 00:37:57.828]  We talked three in the morning, talked to seven in the morning.
[00:37:57.848 --> 00:37:58.708]  You've been up really upset.
[00:37:59.549 --> 00:38:01.769]  You just go through... They had me for 17 hours.
[00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.390]  Well, let's just roll through it all then.
[00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.371]  Let's just talk about exactly
[00:38:08.422 --> 00:38:09.782]  Alex, I'm sorry for cursing, but it's real.
[00:38:32.735 --> 00:38:36.038]  And yeah, I did perpetuate the Farrakhan interview.
[00:38:36.419 --> 00:38:37.380]  Everyone knows who I am.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.223]  If you don't know who I am, then it is what it is.
[00:38:41.564 --> 00:38:43.906]  But Farrakhan happened.
[00:38:44.647 --> 00:38:45.247]  We're talking.
[00:38:46.989 --> 00:38:47.830]  Kanye happened.
[00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:49.311]  I know Elon.
[00:38:49.611 --> 00:38:50.232]  That's happening.
[00:38:51.188 --> 00:38:53.089]  Um, and other things are happening.
[00:38:53.469 --> 00:38:57.652]  By the way, you said three weeks ago to me on the phone, you said Elon's about to go after the press next.
[00:38:58.032 --> 00:39:03.615]  He's come out and said they're fakes, they're liars, they're scammers, they're the fake news, there used to be a citizen's rating group against them.
[00:39:03.635 --> 00:39:05.296]  I mean, absolutely on target.
[00:39:06.597 --> 00:39:07.737]  If I'm wrong, call me out.
[00:39:08.318 --> 00:39:11.739]  But let's walk through what you can say about what the FBI said in big picture.
[00:39:11.759 --> 00:39:16.302]  Something that isn't classified, something that isn't secret about the civil war going on behind the scenes.
[00:39:17.503 --> 00:39:17.923]  Do you want it?
[00:39:19.005 --> 00:39:23.852]  Well, you were saying, you were saying, you know, I mean, basically that the FBI guys got in a big argument with him.
[00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:31.204]  Alex, Alex, Alex, this is, like, this is very, very heavy pressure.
[00:39:31.284 --> 00:39:31.845]  And here's the thing.
[00:39:32.788 --> 00:39:42.432]  They believe that you, myself, Roger Stone, have orchestrated a coup against whatever is the sitting government of the United States of America.
[00:39:42.912 --> 00:39:43.552]  That's not true.
[00:39:44.032 --> 00:39:44.993]  I never talked to you.
[00:39:45.333 --> 00:39:46.613]  You never talked to Roger.
[00:39:47.394 --> 00:39:48.114]  I know Roger.
[00:39:48.234 --> 00:39:48.814]  I know you.
[00:39:49.315 --> 00:39:50.875]  But we never conspired.
[00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:51.836]  That's not true.
[00:39:52.236 --> 00:39:53.456]  That's not true.
[00:39:53.696 --> 00:40:00.599]  And what they're attempting to do is tie us all together based upon our words.
[00:40:01.581 --> 00:40:02.342]  That's problematic.
[00:40:03.383 --> 00:40:06.746]  And you said they were playing hours of clips of me and Roger.
[00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:14.272]  You've been on the same show with him one time, because you've been proven to be a good analyst, good source as a private citizen, saying what you think, never getting anything classified.
[00:40:14.793 --> 00:40:21.559]  You really got my attention with the Vegas stuff, because you put out stuff that I've been told not to put out by real FBI sources on the hostage rescue team.
[00:40:21.579 --> 00:40:24.001]  So the whole FBI isn't bad, it's these special units.
[00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:28.005]  So that's what you were getting into was, you were telling me this morning the FBI knew it was fake,
[00:40:28.365 --> 00:40:43.945]  They've just been told, put the narrative out, and that they're closing in, and that it's going to be Roger Stone and Alex Jones, and I guess they'll try to throw you in with a new thing that it's not Russians, but there was this rogue group that did a coup against Hillary, as if the voters were the coup against Hillary.
[00:40:44.225 --> 00:40:46.208]  So, I mean, tell me what you said this morning.
[00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:51.822]  But at the pinnacle, it's Alex Jones and InfoWars and the listeners.
[00:40:52.482 --> 00:40:58.867]  Why are they not allowing you to make revenue on YouTube?
[00:40:59.047 --> 00:40:59.727]  How could that be?
[00:40:59.747 --> 00:41:01.388]  How could that be?
[00:41:02.609 --> 00:41:05.171]  And the real question becomes, what is fake news?
[00:41:05.311 --> 00:41:06.312]  What does that word mean?
[00:41:06.332 --> 00:41:08.013]  Who is Roger Stone?
[00:41:08.193 --> 00:41:09.214]  Who is Alex Jones?
[00:41:09.454 --> 00:41:10.315]  Who is Zach?
[00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.016]  And I left my last name.
[00:41:20.123 --> 00:41:22.345]  They're going for your neck, Alex.
[00:41:23.066 --> 00:41:23.506]  I'm telling you.
[00:41:23.846 --> 00:41:24.767]  They are coming for you.
[00:41:25.007 --> 00:41:26.088]  They're coming for Roger.
[00:41:26.288 --> 00:41:27.109]  They're coming for me.
[00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:28.971]  I have a good legal team.
[00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:30.252]  I happen to have money.
[00:41:30.792 --> 00:41:32.053]  I happen to have a passport.
[00:41:32.273 --> 00:41:33.134]  So it is what it is.
[00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.976]  But make no mistake, they are coming for us.
[00:41:36.677 --> 00:41:37.578]  This is not a joke.
[00:41:38.422 --> 00:41:39.483]  They are coming.
[00:41:39.543 --> 00:41:40.063]  No, I know.
[00:41:40.143 --> 00:41:40.683]  I'm proud of it.
[00:41:41.003 --> 00:41:41.203]  Now.
[00:41:41.383 --> 00:41:41.763]  Well, I know.
[00:41:41.824 --> 00:41:42.644]  Listen, you're a soldier.
[00:41:42.664 --> 00:41:43.164]  You're a tough guy.
[00:41:43.184 --> 00:41:44.425]  I've been through a lot of combat and stuff.
[00:41:44.765 --> 00:41:46.385]  But let me tell you, we're fighting a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:41:46.425 --> 00:41:47.566]  So, I mean, you ought to feel good.
[00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:49.427]  We got to take our licks for these kids.
[00:41:49.447 --> 00:41:49.867]  Let's do it.
[00:41:50.567 --> 00:41:52.188]  I need you to bring up the Eric Prince shit.
[00:41:52.208 --> 00:41:54.249]  All right.
[00:41:54.389 --> 00:41:55.249]  Hit delay on that again.
[00:41:55.409 --> 00:41:56.570]  I know you're upset, Zach.
[00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.430]  I've never heard you like this.
[00:41:57.450 --> 00:41:58.571]  I know you're freaked out.
[00:41:58.611 --> 00:41:59.291]  What did you say?
[00:41:59.331 --> 00:41:59.831]  Bring up what?
[00:42:02.552 --> 00:42:03.813]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:42:05.472 --> 00:42:09.314]  Well, I know the FBI interrogating you and threatening you, got you upset and everything.
[00:42:10.074 --> 00:42:12.295]  And I understand your family's really mad at you right now, too.
[00:42:12.435 --> 00:42:14.496]  And when it comes out who you are, people will know why that is.
[00:42:14.857 --> 00:42:15.637]  But you've got a lot of courage.
[00:42:15.657 --> 00:42:16.758]  You ought to feel good about this.
[00:42:20.459 --> 00:42:22.200]  Alex, do you know how big you are in this?
[00:42:22.981 --> 00:42:24.101]  Well, I don't want to be big.
[00:42:24.281 --> 00:42:25.902]  I just want to fight the globalists and bring them down.
[00:42:26.202 --> 00:42:26.422]  Some.
[00:42:26.863 --> 00:42:27.523]  You know what's weird?
[00:42:27.723 --> 00:42:28.884]  That they haven't questioned you.
[00:42:29.204 --> 00:42:31.325]  They question Roger, they question me.
[00:42:31.685 --> 00:42:33.146]  How come Alex Jones is not the FBI?
[00:42:36.018 --> 00:42:39.259]  Well, just because they want to get all their BS straight and then come in with a final story.
[00:42:39.579 --> 00:42:42.280]  How could that be that Alex Jones is not being questioned?
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:46.341]  Because they're going to T-bone me in an intersection the day they indict me.
[00:42:47.101 --> 00:42:47.382]  That's why.
[00:42:47.402 --> 00:42:48.342]  That's how I feel!
[00:42:49.082 --> 00:42:50.102]  I'm ready to die.
[00:42:50.683 --> 00:42:51.643]  Well, it's no big deal, man.
[00:42:52.103 --> 00:42:54.704]  It's better dying now than when you're really old with a bunch of tubes up your butt.
[00:42:55.304 --> 00:42:55.924]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:55.964 --> 00:42:56.324]  Stay with us.
[00:42:56.344 --> 00:42:57.365]  I'm not worried about it.
[00:42:57.885 --> 00:42:59.865]  I'm Americana to the end and that's the way it is.
[00:42:59.985 --> 00:43:01.686]  Just like Tommy Robinson is Britannic.
[00:43:09.818 --> 00:43:12.739]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.280]  I wanna rock!
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:22.203]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[00:43:22.263 --> 00:43:28.846]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:43:29.507 --> 00:43:29.907]  Stop.
[00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:30.967]  Stop.
[00:43:34.346 --> 00:43:40.151]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[00:43:40.171 --> 00:43:46.577]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[00:43:46.837 --> 00:43:55.204]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[00:43:55.344 --> 00:43:56.005]  Where's the peace?
[00:43:56.345 --> 00:43:58.267]  All right, what is the trilateral connection?
[00:43:59.485 --> 00:44:02.246]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:10.807]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[00:44:10.828 --> 00:44:16.329]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[00:44:16.829 --> 00:44:21.990]  And, in time, bring about a one-world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[00:44:23.312 --> 00:44:40.085]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:46.930]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.411]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:53.297]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[00:44:53.417 --> 00:44:58.043]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[00:44:59.433 --> 00:45:03.616]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:08.059]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[00:45:08.079 --> 00:45:10.941]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[00:45:10.981 --> 00:45:18.506]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[00:45:18.806 --> 00:45:23.029]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:28.753]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[00:45:29.813 --> 00:45:30.994]  I'm scared of these people.
[00:45:31.674 --> 00:45:34.755]  I'm very scared of them.
[00:45:34.935 --> 00:45:41.116]  How do you think the crack drop gets into the country?
[00:45:41.136 --> 00:45:42.537]  We don't own any planes.
[00:45:42.997 --> 00:45:44.077]  We don't own no ships.
[00:45:44.337 --> 00:45:47.678]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[00:45:47.918 --> 00:45:54.640]  I will tell you, Director Deutch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[00:45:56.813 --> 00:46:04.178]  The men who were working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[00:46:04.218 --> 00:46:09.181]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:16.266]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[00:46:16.726 --> 00:46:23.511]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-contras
[00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:29.273]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[00:46:30.094 --> 00:46:35.996]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[00:46:36.596 --> 00:46:41.598]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:44.980]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.221]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[00:46:48.881 --> 00:46:53.163]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[00:46:53.183 --> 00:46:54.043]  Lewinsky.
[00:46:54.063 --> 00:46:55.924]  These allegations are false.
[00:46:55.944 --> 00:47:02.786]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:08.508]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:24.822 --> 00:47:31.347]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:31.387 --> 00:47:34.909]  Alright, it's...
[00:47:36.785 --> 00:47:37.386]  Memorial Day.
[00:47:38.166 --> 00:47:40.488]  Zach has probably been a caller for a year and a half.
[00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:45.872]  When I heard him say stuff that I knew was absolutely secret that nobody had repeatedly, I checked him out.
[00:47:45.892 --> 00:47:46.873]  He said, yeah, here's who I am.
[00:47:47.293 --> 00:47:48.314]  Checked out his background.
[00:47:48.454 --> 00:47:53.378]  You know, he's been on TV, been in the media, been used in PSYOPs at a lot of levels.
[00:47:53.718 --> 00:47:56.720]  Family's well-to-do over in the Mediterranean.
[00:47:57.461 --> 00:47:57.921]  And so...
[00:47:59.082 --> 00:48:00.262]  I said, okay, tell me more stuff.
[00:48:00.282 --> 00:48:02.663]  He'd never tell me anything secret, because they're listening to the phones.
[00:48:02.923 --> 00:48:04.863]  This morning, they were doing dial tones, hanging up.
[00:48:05.203 --> 00:48:06.244]  I was doing a live feed earlier.
[00:48:06.284 --> 00:48:07.224]  My phone had plenty of power.
[00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:08.524]  They cut that live feed off.
[00:48:08.944 --> 00:48:10.065]  I mean, they're watching us.
[00:48:10.105 --> 00:48:14.006]  Hell, I had Michael Caputo on from the Trump campaign.
[00:48:14.046 --> 00:48:19.847]  He said, no, about, you know, a lot of the time they talked, it was all about you, and are you a mastermind, and what do you do, and blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:20.447 --> 00:48:20.767]  The FBI.
[00:48:20.947 --> 00:48:21.848]  So I talked to other people.
[00:48:21.888 --> 00:48:23.890]  Well, now, Zach hadn't slept all night.
[00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:25.411]  The FBI had him much of yesterday.
[00:48:25.811 --> 00:48:27.012]  I talked to him four or five hours ago.
[00:48:27.032 --> 00:48:27.753]  He was really cogent.
[00:48:27.773 --> 00:48:29.554]  He seems a little frazzled right now.
[00:48:29.574 --> 00:48:33.937]  And during the break, he was like, well, yeah, because America is so evil and run by such bad people now.
[00:48:33.957 --> 00:48:36.619]  And he's a little freaked out by the threats they made on him.
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.321]  He won't even tell me what those threats are.
[00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:45.987]  The FBI said he almost got in a fistfight with them, the things they were saying and doing, because it was so crazy to hear that I'm the mastermind, Roger Stone's the mastermind.
[00:48:46.447 --> 00:48:47.468]  You know, we're going to get it.
[00:48:47.528 --> 00:48:49.750]  He's going to admit we're criminals or he's going to go to jail.
[00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:52.472]  All this stuff, because he knows it's not true.
[00:48:52.532 --> 00:49:04.063]  So he's having this moment, like I had family that was in Vietnam and they were in Guatemala, and there was this moment at the orphanage when they found out they were trafficking kids out for pedophiles.
[00:49:04.483 --> 00:49:09.568]  And that was the moment that this family member I had back in the 70s and 80s said, I'm not part of this.
[00:49:11.414 --> 00:49:13.975]  He blew him and his partner up and all this other stuff.
[00:49:14.435 --> 00:49:16.315]  He lived, but I mean, I already know.
[00:49:16.335 --> 00:49:17.636]  I already know it's dangerous.
[00:49:17.656 --> 00:49:19.056]  I already know it's real.
[00:49:19.076 --> 00:49:21.397]  I already know what's going on at the bottom of the rabbit hole.
[00:49:21.417 --> 00:49:22.017]  I already get it.
[00:49:22.297 --> 00:49:23.297]  I want that spider.
[00:49:23.738 --> 00:49:24.658]  I'm ready to die for it.
[00:49:25.038 --> 00:49:25.758]  Let's get in there.
[00:49:26.298 --> 00:49:28.519]  So I get the fact, Zach, you haven't had any sleep in you.
[00:49:28.819 --> 00:49:29.499]  It's Memorial Day.
[00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:35.561]  You might have had a few Budweiser's, but just finish up your point of why you're so upset, what you can say, what you can't say, because I know
[00:49:36.061 --> 00:49:38.882]  You know, they say you're not supposed to talk because of what you do in PsyOps.
[00:49:39.162 --> 00:49:40.062]  This isn't PsyOps.
[00:49:40.362 --> 00:49:46.143]  This is you, a citizen, a patriot, a guy that was in Libya, all these other places, that saw what you weren't supposed to see.
[00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.264]  We already know all about it.
[00:49:47.704 --> 00:49:50.884]  We already got it from Plumlee and Colonel Schaefer and everybody else.
[00:49:50.924 --> 00:49:52.265]  We already know everything.
[00:49:52.645 --> 00:49:53.765]  The public knows.
[00:49:54.165 --> 00:49:55.986]  The decision has been made to move on from that.
[00:49:56.366 --> 00:49:57.506]  The point is, is that
[00:49:58.473 --> 00:50:03.337]  What is it that's got you at this point in time, the Farrakhan thing, the must thing, all of it.
[00:50:03.357 --> 00:50:04.758]  You've been dead on what you've said on air.
[00:50:04.998 --> 00:50:06.059]  So what else do you want to add?
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:16.407]  Yeah, so Alex Jones and Roger Stone have concocted the complete downfall of America.
[00:50:17.307 --> 00:50:17.848]  I don't think so.
[00:50:19.689 --> 00:50:20.250]  I don't think so.
[00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.531]  So tell me what you were saying this morning.
[00:50:22.551 --> 00:50:23.432]  You were very fluent.
[00:50:23.472 --> 00:50:24.133]  You let it all out.
[00:50:24.153 --> 00:50:26.594]  I mean, tell me what got you so upset while they were telling you this stuff.
[00:50:26.654 --> 00:50:27.235]  I mean, break it down.
[00:50:30.211 --> 00:50:38.558]  When I was questioned by the FBI, they announced or questioned my association with you.
[00:50:39.698 --> 00:50:49.706]  And they said, uh, so you and Alex Jones, like, um, for sure, like it's orchestrated, right?
[00:50:50.407 --> 00:50:53.990]  Like you, Roger, everything like Roger knows Trump.
[00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:55.391]  Alex knows me.
[00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:56.552]  I know me.
[00:50:57.092 --> 00:50:59.414]  No, they believe.
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:13.928]  In true fruition, that Roger Stone is running the Trump campaign, that Alex Jones is talking to Zach, and Zach is running InfoWars.
[00:51:14.688 --> 00:51:15.729]  Here's the shit kicker.
[00:51:15.749 --> 00:51:16.529]  Excuse me.
[00:51:16.569 --> 00:51:16.970]  I'm sorry.
[00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.791]  Delay that one more time, Zach.
[00:51:18.971 --> 00:51:19.271]  Please.
[00:51:22.233 --> 00:51:22.773]  Go ahead, Zach.
[00:51:23.053 --> 00:51:23.694]  Here's the problem.
[00:51:23.874 --> 00:51:24.474]  Here's the problem.
[00:51:25.895 --> 00:51:26.976]  Alex, we've never talked.
[00:51:28.416 --> 00:51:29.937]  We're not, we're not connected.
[00:51:30.177 --> 00:51:31.438]  I've never been to Austin.
[00:51:31.778 --> 00:51:38.002]  We've never... Well, to be specific, when you laid out that Vegas stuff that I was asked not to add to it, I knew you weren't BSing.
[00:51:38.062 --> 00:51:39.403]  And he said, okay, here's who I am.
[00:51:39.423 --> 00:51:40.624]  And I looked you up and you were in the newspaper.
[00:51:40.644 --> 00:51:46.608]  And then we've talked, I don't know, maybe, maybe seven, eight, nine times where you're like, should I do this documentary?
[00:51:47.068 --> 00:51:48.469]  Should I get out of the military?
[00:51:48.509 --> 00:51:49.970]  And I'm like, dude, do whatever you want.
[00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:54.613]  The same Netflix that Barack Obama and Michelle O just got a contract to, by the way.
[00:51:57.846 --> 00:52:00.028]  Yeah, so that's been the discussion, what you should do with your career.
[00:52:00.428 --> 00:52:01.749]  And I told you to make that a decision.
[00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:07.174]  So just, so it's on the record though, why, this upset you to be accused of being a traitor when you're not?
[00:52:07.254 --> 00:52:09.736]  I mean, just because criminals that have hijacked the government.
[00:52:09.916 --> 00:52:14.980]  Oh, I'm not, oh, oh, they accused me of being a traitor and I promise you I'm not.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:21.625]  Listen, Zach, but just because there's criminals in the government, don't take that like you've had your character besmirched and freak out by that.
[00:52:22.025 --> 00:52:24.987]  This is a come to Jesus moment where you realize just how bad it is.
[00:52:27.712 --> 00:52:31.053]  Alex, this show right now, we're working it out on air.
[00:52:31.774 --> 00:52:32.894]  And it's not easy.
[00:52:32.974 --> 00:52:39.516]  It's not like we could just have a workshop and say, hey, you should say this or you should say that.
[00:52:39.936 --> 00:52:40.936]  It's difficult.
[00:52:40.996 --> 00:52:41.416]  Oh, I know.
[00:52:41.456 --> 00:52:47.538]  You said they accused you of, like, about a month ago, being here and it was all being staged, no?
[00:52:48.702 --> 00:52:49.402]  Yeah, 100%.
[00:52:50.083 --> 00:52:52.863]  They said, oh, you're in the other room with Alex.
[00:52:53.484 --> 00:52:55.464]  I said, no, I've never met Alex.
[00:52:55.524 --> 00:52:56.625]  I've talked to him on the phone.
[00:52:56.665 --> 00:53:02.107]  They said, no, you're in the other room with him, and he has a narrative for you.
[00:53:02.307 --> 00:53:05.027]  I said, no, that never happened.
[00:53:05.448 --> 00:53:06.528]  See, they're all followers.
[00:53:06.568 --> 00:53:07.728]  They get the narrative.
[00:53:08.389 --> 00:53:10.129]  Do you believe that stupidity?
[00:53:10.609 --> 00:53:11.330]  Did you believe that?
[00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:13.770]  But you made great points about we're organic.
[00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:15.051]  We all know the truth.
[00:53:15.811 --> 00:53:21.674]  I mean, I've had, I've had, I've had, I've had, uh, Tonto Piranto on, the hero of Benghazi.
[00:53:22.275 --> 00:53:23.715]  He's a great guy, he loves the show.
[00:53:24.336 --> 00:53:25.777]  Uh, he told us what went on.
[00:53:26.377 --> 00:53:27.217]  What's our sources?
[00:53:27.257 --> 00:53:28.198]  The guys on the ground.
[00:53:28.698 --> 00:53:29.999]  The guys at CENTCOM.
[00:53:30.079 --> 00:53:33.161]  I mean, it's not Zack, even though Zack's been in CENTCOM.
[00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:34.101]  Don't you get it?
[00:53:34.121 --> 00:53:35.382]  We're all pissed off, man.
[00:53:35.662 --> 00:53:39.524]  We all know what went on, but there's such followers, they can't believe we all think alike.
[00:53:39.544 --> 00:53:42.606]  Listen, maybe, maybe I'm not as elegant.
[00:53:43.266 --> 00:53:47.275]  Like, I'm not as elegant as I usually am because I'm stressed out.
[00:53:48.749 --> 00:53:49.269]  Because of this.
[00:53:49.649 --> 00:53:50.350]  I understand, brother.
[00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.690]  It's real.
[00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:51.510]  You've been up all night.
[00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:59.453]  What I'm saying is so problematic and so perpetuated that I don't know how to say it.
[00:53:59.473 --> 00:54:01.453]  No, I know you're sitting on top of all this stuff, you know.
[00:54:01.493 --> 00:54:02.734]  We don't want the classified stuff.
[00:54:02.754 --> 00:54:04.174]  We already know everything that's going on.
[00:54:04.534 --> 00:54:06.895]  The big issue here is we get the whole globalist agenda.
[00:54:06.935 --> 00:54:11.677]  You can have propaganda, but you also have movements and you have signs and we get the agenda.
[00:54:12.057 --> 00:54:14.538]  We know where the New World Order is going better than their top people.
[00:54:14.898 --> 00:54:16.900]  Because we're not followers like them.
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:18.921]  That said, you've done a great job.
[00:54:18.941 --> 00:54:19.882]  You've exposed a lot.
[00:54:20.262 --> 00:54:21.463]  The Farrakhan thing is out.
[00:54:21.863 --> 00:54:25.706]  How big is that, that he has this backhanded thing where he knows he's got to come out?
[00:54:25.726 --> 00:54:31.030]  Well, the thing is, how did you reach out to him?
[00:54:31.351 --> 00:54:32.251]  How did it happen?
[00:54:33.793 --> 00:54:37.596]  My question is, Farrakhan would say it, you would say it, everyone would say it.
[00:54:38.176 --> 00:54:39.297]  How was the connection made?
[00:54:41.673 --> 00:54:49.097]  Well, I mean, you've shown you a lot of good connections, because I've talked to some of them about you talking to them separately, but... I don't mean to be... No, no, I understand.
[00:54:49.137 --> 00:54:52.499]  I understand that it was, it was, it was... They reached out to me.
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.040]  I'm trying.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.161]  I'm trying.
[00:54:55.321 --> 00:54:56.642]  I'm trying to save this country.
[00:54:57.022 --> 00:54:57.782]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:58.063 --> 00:55:00.044]  I'm sorry that all these things are going on.
[00:55:00.324 --> 00:55:03.486]  I don't want pedophiles to run our country.
[00:55:03.766 --> 00:55:04.326]  So, period.
[00:55:04.786 --> 00:55:07.528]  If you have a problem with me, come find me.
[00:55:08.048 --> 00:55:08.989]  I'm not going to stop.
[00:55:09.784 --> 00:55:11.425]  I'm not going to stop talking to Alex Jones.
[00:55:11.745 --> 00:55:12.165]  Period.
[00:55:12.565 --> 00:55:13.645]  Alright, Zach.
[00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:19.407]  Zach, what you need to do is relax, get some sleep, let's get you back on tomorrow to break this down.
[00:55:19.427 --> 00:55:20.288]  We really appreciate you.
[00:55:20.328 --> 00:55:22.008]  Roger Stone's coming up, okay?
[00:55:22.028 --> 00:55:22.889]  You've done a good job.
[00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:32.412]  I'm sorry they threatened you, pulled you off that boat, all the rest of it, when you were trying to go out and fishing, but you told me a lot of interesting things about what they said and thank you for giving us that picture.
[00:55:32.452 --> 00:55:37.754]  We already knew from Michael Caputo was on Monday, you know, seven days ago, six days ago, we already know
[00:55:38.154 --> 00:55:38.654]  You are the epicenter!
[00:55:38.674 --> 00:55:39.595]  You are the epicenter!
[00:55:39.655 --> 00:55:41.737]  There's nothing!
[00:55:41.757 --> 00:55:42.198]  There's nothing!
[00:55:42.218 --> 00:55:42.658]  There's nothing!
[00:55:42.678 --> 00:55:43.699]  There's Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:55:43.839 --> 00:55:44.139]  Period.
[00:55:57.145 --> 00:55:57.906]  That's really silly.
[00:55:58.727 --> 00:55:59.248]  God bless you.
[00:55:59.268 --> 00:56:00.089]  We're going to talk soon.
[00:56:00.129 --> 00:56:11.442]  The truth is there's the American people, and there's Matt Drudge, and there's WorldNetDaily, and there's The Daily Caller, and there's just all these groups and all these organizations, and Turning Point, and Candace Owens, and Kanye West.
[00:56:12.381 --> 00:56:19.386]  They've decided, because I've said so much and done so much, they can demonize me, and they've got more material to make me look crazy.
[00:56:19.426 --> 00:56:21.867]  It's not that I'm that good, it's that I'm that real.
[00:56:22.608 --> 00:56:35.997]  They've decided to choose me as the albatross to hang around Trump's neck, and they think with enough demonization in the last few years, enough lies, enough edited tapes, that when they hang it around my neck, everybody will buy it and desert me.
[00:56:37.073 --> 00:56:56.248]  I'm not worried about it, because I took on the Globals for the children, not because I'm a hero, but because, just like Tommy Robinson, watching him for a year, traffic kids in front of his tanning salon, little girls crying, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old, being shoved into cars with men by Muslims, but it was Brits and others coming to get the kids.
[00:56:56.268 --> 00:56:56.948]  They're all involved.
[00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:58.229]  Don't just blame the Muslims.
[00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.552]  He had to start physically beating their asses and got put in prison for it.
[00:57:03.385 --> 00:57:05.308]  I beat their ass the first time, I'm just telling you.
[00:57:05.328 --> 00:57:07.791]  But that's what he sat there and had to watch.
[00:57:07.851 --> 00:57:10.214]  He's a hero because he's still a man.
[00:57:10.294 --> 00:57:11.095]  He's not a demon.
[00:57:11.395 --> 00:57:13.317]  He knows when he sees evil, he's gonna fight.
[00:57:13.538 --> 00:57:16.762]  So he's in a secret prison and the government's ordered no reporting on it.
[00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:20.144]  And Zach this morning was not as exhausted as he is.
[00:57:20.184 --> 00:57:20.844]  He's been up all night.
[00:57:20.864 --> 00:57:21.904]  He was calling me at 3 a.m.
[00:57:21.924 --> 00:57:24.405]  He's really exhausted and freaked out because of all the stuff he knows.
[00:57:24.425 --> 00:57:25.766]  The horrible things he saw in Libya.
[00:57:27.126 --> 00:57:33.029]  And all the classified stuff he knows about putting the women in cages and all the stuff Hillary and Soros are up to.
[00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.009]  He's scared.
[00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:35.630]  For his family, for everybody.
[00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:38.311]  Just because it freaks him out as a person what's happening.
[00:57:38.491 --> 00:57:40.972]  You can hear the threats they made yesterday are horrible.
[00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:42.652]  This is what it is.
[00:57:42.672 --> 00:57:43.432]  This is where we've come to.
[00:57:43.772 --> 00:57:44.853]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:57:44.913 --> 00:57:46.273]  We've got incredible information.
[00:57:46.293 --> 00:57:48.073]  But 13 people have been raided.

[00:58:10.877 --> 00:58:17.200]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:00:21.425 --> 01:00:22.125]  Big Brother.
[01:00:22.565 --> 01:00:23.826]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:24.366 --> 01:00:26.266]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:26.286 --> 01:00:27.727]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:27.947 --> 01:00:29.127]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:29.607 --> 01:00:34.149]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:42.011]  You know, some people drink to take courage before a fight.
[01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:45.612]  I drink because I've got too much fight.
[01:00:45.852 --> 01:00:48.613]  I've got a temperate, where I'll tear people around me apart.
[01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:54.084]  But I've stopped that as much as I can as well.
[01:00:54.104 --> 01:01:00.527]  A lot of wires got crossed today because I only had three crew members that could come in on an emergency call to do this live broadcast.
[01:01:00.547 --> 01:01:02.609]  We had a great rebroadcast lined up for you.
[01:01:02.629 --> 01:01:03.389]  It's Memorial Day.
[01:01:03.429 --> 01:01:06.451]  We're live at 12 noon central, 1 pm eastern.
[01:01:07.051 --> 01:01:10.393]  Roger Stone thought he was on at 11 30 central, so he's not responding now.
[01:01:10.413 --> 01:01:12.515]  He thought we made him sit there on hold for 30 minutes.
[01:01:12.535 --> 01:01:13.195]  That wasn't the case.
[01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:17.458]  Because he gave me the big download on Mueller does plan to frame him.
[01:01:18.683 --> 01:01:26.067]  The focus has changed to Alex Jones and Roger Stone and just American collusion.
[01:01:27.108 --> 01:01:29.609]  So I guess us being anti-Hillary is a crime.
[01:01:29.629 --> 01:01:31.630]  That's what they were telling Zach.
[01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:38.194]  Zach was like lining up exactly what Roger had told me, Saturday and Sunday, off air.
[01:01:40.935 --> 01:01:42.016]  That's why I know Zach's credible.
[01:01:42.316 --> 01:01:43.317]  Plus he's been in the news.
[01:01:43.777 --> 01:01:44.577]  Folks know who he is.
[01:01:45.038 --> 01:01:46.358]  And you know, Zach's under a lot of pressure.
[01:01:46.398 --> 01:01:47.219]  He's been up all night.
[01:01:48.425 --> 01:01:49.766]  And I understand that.
[01:01:50.366 --> 01:01:51.186]  You've heard him many times.
[01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:52.167]  You heard how upset he was.
[01:01:52.767 --> 01:01:53.768]  He's a real person.
[01:01:53.848 --> 01:02:02.392]  He's not like DSQ, Deep State Q, that is a fabrication and of course has the media loving it and promoting it and pushing it.
[01:02:03.193 --> 01:02:04.173]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:02:04.193 --> 01:02:05.314]  I've been around 23 years.
[01:02:05.374 --> 01:02:06.414]  I said Trump would win.
[01:02:06.434 --> 01:02:08.936]  I said cell phones were giving you brain tumors.
[01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:10.236]  I said GMO was killing you.
[01:02:10.396 --> 01:02:11.057]  It's all admitted.
[01:02:11.697 --> 01:02:12.638]  I'm just a fan of humanity.
[01:02:12.678 --> 01:02:13.298]  He's telling the truth.
[01:02:13.318 --> 01:02:14.278]  Let's move it forward.
[01:02:15.179 --> 01:02:17.100]  And I'm so far down this thing now.
[01:02:19.284 --> 01:02:23.507]  I've already worked through every possible permutation of what they can do to me and I just accept it.
[01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:28.129]  Because somebody's got to stand up to them if humanity has a future.
[01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:29.690]  It's not a heroic action.
[01:02:30.211 --> 01:02:32.012]  It is a self-preservation action.
[01:02:35.854 --> 01:02:37.635]  Tommy Robinson is in prison.
[01:02:39.777 --> 01:02:41.338]  One hour after he was arrested.
[01:02:42.298 --> 01:02:44.039]  And the judge orders no one to cover it.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:46.761]  And there's photos of the judge smirking.
[01:02:47.622 --> 01:02:48.222]  Like the Joker.
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.982]  That archetypal image of delusional tyranny is all we need.
[01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:57.865]  You know, tyranny and corruption tends to take over when people get large-ass and decadent.
[01:03:01.088 --> 01:03:09.353]  But, once they get in total power, then they start flaunting it, and they find that the sleeping giant was sleeping, not intimidating.
[01:03:12.435 --> 01:03:14.056]  So, that's the news on that front.
[01:03:14.836 --> 01:03:18.319]  There's nowhere I'd rather be on Memorial Day than right here on AIR LIVE with you.
[01:03:19.246 --> 01:03:22.668]  I did the whole last hour, didn't even plug, even though they're trying to shut us down.
[01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:26.611]  When you financially support us and get great products at the same time, it makes it all possible.
[01:03:26.992 --> 01:03:28.112]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:03:31.515 --> 01:03:35.678]  A lot of people have been pre-programmed by the media and everything that when the U.S.
[01:03:35.718 --> 01:03:41.082]  government comes and tells you you're a bad person, you're supposed to ball up in the corner and piss yourself.
[01:03:41.102 --> 01:03:42.583]  But you know, this same U.S.
[01:03:42.623 --> 01:03:45.365]  government lets illegal aliens shoot women in the back and lets them go.
[01:03:46.994 --> 01:03:49.435]  Let's jihadist murder people in mass and covers it up.
[01:03:49.535 --> 01:03:51.115]  So this isn't our government.
[01:03:51.155 --> 01:03:56.177]  This is a parasitic overlay, a face sucking system we're trying to remove.
[01:03:57.217 --> 01:04:02.099]  And it's going to be a bloody process, but we're not going to have a future if we don't do it.
[01:04:02.419 --> 01:04:12.522]  So I'm not just going to hide myself off wherever and hope it passes me over so I can physically eat steaks and act powerful and strut around.
[01:04:14.494 --> 01:04:17.255]  I want to be part of the real zest that made humanity.
[01:04:17.655 --> 01:04:21.117]  The real zest that led us to this point and can lead us to the next point.
[01:04:22.878 --> 01:04:31.401]  I know there's a real stairway to heaven, but it's paved with taking action and will and historical research and understanding and total commitment.
[01:04:32.442 --> 01:04:36.924]  And if you just totally commit, then there's no more fear.
[01:04:38.785 --> 01:04:41.086]  But I know soldiers, I know people that have been leaders,
[01:04:42.096 --> 01:04:45.860]  Multiple leaders, Navy SEALs, SEAL Team 6, Delta Force, all nine yards.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.623]  And they're strong guys and they're great and everything.
[01:04:49.163 --> 01:04:55.469]  But when it comes to moral courage to speak out, a lot of guys that have Congressional Medal of Honor winners are scared to talk.
[01:04:56.951 --> 01:04:59.213]  Because they are conforming to their own death.
[01:05:04.045 --> 01:05:04.786]  I'm so excited.
[01:05:04.846 --> 01:05:14.392]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:05:14.992 --> 01:05:20.176]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:05:20.496 --> 01:05:23.298]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:05:23.518 --> 01:05:32.264]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:05:34.385 --> 01:05:39.166]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:05:39.686 --> 01:05:43.907]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:05:44.648 --> 01:05:53.470]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.270]  It is amazing!
[01:05:56.651 --> 01:06:01.632]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:18.588]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:20.592]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:11.253]  We are winning in the take back of the Republic.
[01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:26.642]  But those of us in the front lines are going to be demonized, we're going to be attacked, and we're going to be twisted, at least our doppelgangers, our straw men, into something to hurt America.
[01:07:27.182 --> 01:07:31.805]  The enemy takes our strengths and twists our swords into lies.
[01:07:34.275 --> 01:07:38.338]  And that's what they're doing to Donald Trump, they're doing it to me, they're doing it to anybody else that sticks their heads up.
[01:07:38.999 --> 01:07:45.264]  You can go to DrudgeReport.com and you can see all about Tommy Robinson in prison.
[01:07:45.684 --> 01:07:50.408]  You can see the link over on the right-hand side to the Soviet events.
[01:07:51.449 --> 01:08:01.017]  Tommy Robinson update, UK in shock as judge orders cover-up in Soviet-style disappearance of journalists.
[01:08:02.159 --> 01:08:03.300]  Activist jailed in London.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.160]  Judge orders press blackout.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.081]  Robins in silence.
[01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:10.003]  There is almost no coverage of this in the U.S.
[01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:13.024]  other than Infowars.com and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:16.746]  It isn't like I'm up there going, oh look, I'm exclusive.
[01:08:16.866 --> 01:08:18.147]  I don't want to be exclusive.
[01:08:18.767 --> 01:08:27.311]  I was sitting there at 7am catching catfish on a totally calm lake with no one on it.
[01:08:29.266 --> 01:08:32.829]  And my children putting their life preservers on to get in a little fishing boat.
[01:08:34.090 --> 01:08:38.554]  My middle daughter and my son, my older daughter, was up there with my baby and my wife.
[01:08:40.615 --> 01:08:41.496]  They were so excited.
[01:08:41.516 --> 01:08:44.358]  They said, Daddy, let's go to that island where we catch all those fish.
[01:08:45.099 --> 01:08:46.640]  And I said, I'm sorry, I gotta leave.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:51.284]  And my middle daughter, sweetheart, said, again, Daddy?
[01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:54.955]  And I'm not even complaining.
[01:08:54.995 --> 01:08:59.036]  Tommy Robinson's in a prison, but we're all gonna be there if we don't start fighting.
[01:08:59.777 --> 01:09:01.317]  That's the sacrifices it takes.
[01:09:09.839 --> 01:09:13.260]  But I know 13 people have been questioned the last week and a half.
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.241]  I talked to Michael Caputo, the only one that had courage to come on and say his name, because they threatened him.
[01:09:17.281 --> 01:09:19.742]  They said, you don't talk about this or you're going to prison.
[01:09:20.919 --> 01:09:21.699]  They threatened Zack.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:26.522]  And Zack's a combat veteran, decorated, well-known guy in PSYOPs, an officer.
[01:09:26.843 --> 01:09:34.107]  You heard him breaking down earlier on air because his family and the Pentagon and the FBI said, you're going to prison if you talk to Jones again.
[01:09:35.208 --> 01:09:37.049]  So you need to understand the levels we're at.
[01:09:37.129 --> 01:09:39.750]  And then Louis Farrakhan, they take what he says out of context.
[01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:40.791]  He said stuff I don't agree with.
[01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:44.473]  He invited me to his house a few years ago, said, I actually like Trump.
[01:09:44.533 --> 01:09:45.854]  How do I break that to my people?
[01:09:47.075 --> 01:09:47.895]  And he played this clip.
[01:09:47.915 --> 01:09:48.696]  We're going to Roger Stone.
[01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:52.653]  This clip happened Friday morning, went viral Saturday.
[01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:55.556]  Liz Faircon gives a backhanded endorsement of Trump.
[01:09:57.463 --> 01:10:00.404]  Even more sophisticated than Kanye just saying, I love Trump, we have a right to do this.
[01:10:00.744 --> 01:10:03.125]  He says, oh yeah, Trump is out to get us, whatever, yeah.
[01:10:03.605 --> 01:10:05.426]  But, boy, the elite really hate him.
[01:10:05.486 --> 01:10:07.106]  And, boy, he's an anomaly, isn't he?
[01:10:07.146 --> 01:10:08.326]  And kind of stuff's good happening.
[01:10:08.847 --> 01:10:11.788]  I know for a fact Farrakhan likes Trump.
[01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:13.188]  They don't know what to do.
[01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:15.129]  And Farrakhan didn't even say don't tell people that.
[01:10:15.389 --> 01:10:17.029]  I'm at dinner with him after a three hour interview.
[01:10:17.389 --> 01:10:20.170]  I'm at his house, dinner, for hours and hours.
[01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:21.371]  Man, these guys could talk forever.
[01:10:23.531 --> 01:10:24.251]  Super intense.
[01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:25.912]  Super smart.
[01:10:27.728 --> 01:10:31.251]  And they wanted to know the future.
[01:10:31.271 --> 01:10:35.294]  They could instinctively get Trump was not out to get black people and wanted to change things.
[01:10:35.334 --> 01:10:36.475]  He just wants prosperity.
[01:10:37.056 --> 01:10:39.458]  So here's Louis Farrakhan basically endorsing Trump.
[01:10:39.718 --> 01:10:40.979]  They understand, folks.
[01:10:40.999 --> 01:10:42.800]  And we're going to Roger Stone in two minutes.
[01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:44.081]  Here is Louis Farrakhan.
[01:10:45.342 --> 01:10:50.927]  And some people would argue that it's better now that the racism is more in our face rather than hitting.
[01:10:51.287 --> 01:10:52.068]  Hitting, excuse me.
[01:10:52.268 --> 01:10:53.429]  What's your perspective on that?
[01:10:54.232 --> 01:11:00.717]  Well, that wasn't the intent of this administration to do a lot of good for us.
[01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:06.381]  But the nature of this administration is good for us.
[01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:06.862]  Hey, pause.
[01:11:07.262 --> 01:11:07.883]  Start over again.
[01:11:07.903 --> 01:11:10.825]  He didn't even really give him a backhand compliment.
[01:11:11.085 --> 01:11:16.629]  I wish I could talk like that, because Farrakhan's probably the most well-spoken person in the world today.
[01:11:16.929 --> 01:11:18.511]  Even better than Trump, better than Roger Stone.
[01:11:19.574 --> 01:11:20.874]  The way he takes it all.
[01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:22.915]  I'm not being honest about Farrakhan.
[01:11:23.015 --> 01:11:29.357]  I was with him for three hours on air, and then hours and hours of dinner, and it was like, he got every nuance, every angle, you name it.
[01:11:29.377 --> 01:11:31.417]  I'm not kissing his ass, it's just true.
[01:11:31.978 --> 01:11:35.899]  And I noticed that guy's like, yeah, the racism's out in the open now with Trump.
[01:11:36.879 --> 01:11:39.400]  Farrakhan knows the truth from all the rappers and everybody else about Trump.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:41.060]  Because he likes black people.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:41.520]  He likes everybody.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:42.340]  He really likes black people.
[01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:43.121]  He likes the energy.
[01:11:45.535 --> 01:11:46.677]  Ask Roger Stone, but he won't tell you.
[01:11:47.217 --> 01:11:57.991]  The point is, is that he's sitting there and Farrakhan just takes that like a judo move and pushes it aside and goes, oh yeah, but that wasn't the intent.
[01:11:59.241 --> 01:12:00.081]  You know, to help us.
[01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:01.381]  He just sidesteps that.
[01:12:01.501 --> 01:12:04.542]  But, notice he's this big disruptor and then he endorses Trump.
[01:12:04.942 --> 01:12:07.903]  Because he knows if he just comes out and endorses him, he'll be destroyed.
[01:12:07.943 --> 01:12:10.603]  But can he get these folks to come to the water and drink?
[01:12:10.623 --> 01:12:11.724]  You can lead a horse to water.
[01:12:12.024 --> 01:12:13.004]  Can you make it drink?
[01:12:13.504 --> 01:12:16.805]  Because the establishment you hate wants to kill everybody that supports Trump.
[01:12:17.025 --> 01:12:17.625]  Let's go to this clip.
[01:12:17.665 --> 01:12:17.965]  Here it is.
[01:12:19.525 --> 01:12:25.126]  And some people would argue that it's better now that the racism is more in our face rather than hitting.
[01:12:25.467 --> 01:12:26.267]  Hitting, excuse me.
[01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.627]  What's your perspective on that?
[01:12:28.427 --> 01:12:34.929]  Well, that wasn't the intent of this administration to do a lot of good for us.
[01:12:36.069 --> 01:12:40.611]  But the nature of this administration is good for us.
[01:12:41.251 --> 01:12:46.513]  Because now, you know, sometimes you think you're where you are not.
[01:12:47.373 --> 01:12:49.354]  And so Trump is letting you know.
[01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:51.754]  We really stand.
[01:12:52.494 --> 01:12:57.276]  And because of Trump's way, he is an anomaly.
[01:12:57.717 --> 01:13:02.419]  There's never been no president quite like Mr. Trump.
[01:13:03.199 --> 01:13:05.260]  But there's something that he's doing.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:08.802]  I'm going to come out in a few weeks and talk about it.
[01:13:09.442 --> 01:13:15.945]  But Trump is destroying every enemy that was an enemy of our rise.
[01:13:16.586 --> 01:13:18.206]  Who's the enemy of our rise?
[01:13:18.927 --> 01:13:19.207]  Is it
[01:13:20.168 --> 01:13:22.870]  The Department of Justice, where we get none?
[01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:29.534]  Is it Congress, where you make a law that favors us and then you turn around and destroy it?
[01:13:30.314 --> 01:13:38.239]  Is it the media that has destroyed every black leader that stood up for us, calling us out of our name?
[01:13:38.759 --> 01:13:45.023]  Martin Luther King suffered it, Malcolm suffered it, DuBois suffered it, Marcus Garvey suffered it.
[01:13:45.945 --> 01:13:49.067]  So he's attacking the media, calls it fake news.
[01:13:49.407 --> 01:13:58.132]  Well, I don't think everything is fake news, but I know very well that we have been the victims of some fake news.
[01:13:58.212 --> 01:14:01.094]  He's beating up the FBI!
[01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.080]  Go at it, baby!
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:13.907]  Because they've been beating the hell out of us ever since J. Edgar Hoover and the counterintelligence program of the U.S.
[01:14:13.947 --> 01:14:14.347]  government.
[01:14:14.768 --> 01:14:16.669]  So, go ahead, Mr. Trump.
[01:14:20.292 --> 01:14:23.474]  So that's Farrakhan trying to wake people up who've been brainwashed.
[01:14:23.634 --> 01:14:24.595]  We've all been brainwashed.
[01:14:25.967 --> 01:14:29.450]  But it's a historic moment, because the truth is, Trump is pragmatic.
[01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:30.811]  He wants everybody to have a future.
[01:14:31.291 --> 01:14:32.612]  The globalists know that.
[01:14:32.712 --> 01:14:33.673]  That's why they're out to get him.
[01:14:34.133 --> 01:14:36.195]  And this is a pretty big time to be alive, Roger Stone.
[01:14:36.215 --> 01:14:37.836]  We're going to come back for two segments with you.
[01:14:37.876 --> 01:14:39.017]  I appreciate you being here with us.
[01:14:39.438 --> 01:14:40.378]  None of us were going to come in today.
[01:14:40.398 --> 01:14:41.639]  You had plans with your family at the beach.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:42.800]  Your wife's been sick.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.284]  But history, we've now 12 people you've talked to, now Army officer.
[01:14:47.744 --> 01:14:52.128]  They came to him and they said, Roger Stone and Alex Jones, the masterminds with Trump,
[01:14:52.828 --> 01:14:53.428]  Of treason.
[01:14:53.828 --> 01:14:55.249]  You better agree that you've been part of it.
[01:14:55.329 --> 01:14:56.189]  He's like, this is insane.
[01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.810]  I never met him.
[01:14:57.210 --> 01:14:58.991]  I've been a guest on one show with Roger Stone.
[01:14:59.051 --> 01:14:59.911]  This is the level, Roger.
[01:15:01.332 --> 01:15:03.272]  No, it's really extraordinary, Alex.
[01:15:03.793 --> 01:15:12.956]  You know, having come up empty handed on the whole Russian collusion, WikiLeaks nonsense, although they continue to ask those insane questions of people.
[01:15:13.737 --> 01:15:17.118]  And then you have mainstream media outlets like the Atlantic.
[01:15:17.971 --> 01:15:18.512]  I think so.
[01:15:40.848 --> 01:15:46.192]  offense that is designed to leverage my testimony against the President of the United States.
[01:15:46.212 --> 01:15:46.993]  So let me say this.
[01:15:47.613 --> 01:15:49.675]  John Dean, I am not.
[01:15:49.955 --> 01:15:51.817]  That's right, and the weird thing is I have no fear.
[01:15:52.397 --> 01:15:59.663]  I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be for all those children that these Satanists and pedophiles are abusing, and I can feel their fall.
[01:16:00.263 --> 01:16:01.524]  I am so honored right now.
[01:16:01.584 --> 01:16:03.105]  Roger will be right back.
[01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:07.489]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available
[01:16:08.655 --> 01:16:16.856]  Books that have been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[01:16:19.317 --> 01:16:25.438]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[01:16:26.858 --> 01:16:29.399]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[01:16:30.179 --> 01:16:33.599]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:36.660]  But really what it was was crony capitalism.
[01:16:38.413 --> 01:16:43.596]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[01:16:45.538 --> 01:16:52.142]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[01:16:53.103 --> 01:16:54.124]  It's up to us personally.
[01:16:55.504 --> 01:17:02.349]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[01:17:02.869 --> 01:17:04.150]  I expected that to happen.
[01:17:05.331 --> 01:17:06.672]  This is 21st century warfare.
[01:17:08.655 --> 01:17:19.581]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[01:17:20.282 --> 01:17:21.823]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[01:17:22.523 --> 01:17:34.150]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.912]  And we've already come so far together
[01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:46.958]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:52.943]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[01:17:54.084 --> 01:18:01.951]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[01:18:04.181 --> 01:18:12.468]  But if you look at the Infowars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[01:18:12.908 --> 01:18:14.429]  That's a conservative estimate.
[01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:18.092]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[01:18:18.893 --> 01:18:20.714]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[01:18:20.754 --> 01:18:25.638]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[01:18:26.739 --> 01:18:37.516]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[01:18:37.576 --> 01:18:41.522]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[01:18:42.944 --> 01:18:43.584]  Our game changing.
[01:18:44.025 --> 01:18:45.526]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[01:18:45.706 --> 01:18:46.867]  The other equation of probiotic.
[01:18:46.927 --> 01:18:50.489]  It's now stronger and a lower price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:51.910]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:56.353]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[01:18:56.893 --> 01:19:00.155]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[01:19:00.175 --> 01:19:01.256]  It just does incredible things.
[01:19:01.676 --> 01:19:03.137]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[01:19:03.157 --> 01:19:06.139]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[01:19:06.159 --> 01:19:08.681]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:19:09.201 --> 01:19:14.023]  That's 4 to 5 of Choletal Silver and Iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[01:19:14.663 --> 01:19:25.788]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of Choletal Silver out there.
[01:19:26.228 --> 01:19:31.250]  Silver, Salt, Nano Silver, Iodine, the ionized water, Stevia, Peppermint,
[01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:33.130]  Essential oil and so much more.
[01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.451]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[01:19:34.671 --> 01:19:35.851]  You can swallow it as well.
[01:19:36.251 --> 01:19:42.532]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:44.212]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:19:44.252 --> 01:19:53.834]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[01:19:54.154 --> 01:19:57.215]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:20:06.414 --> 01:20:09.056]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:24.677 --> 01:20:28.738]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:20:29.498 --> 01:20:30.938]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:31.198 --> 01:20:32.319]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:32.859 --> 01:20:37.600]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:48.982]  And it's said in the New Testament that Jesus wept the Garden of Gethsemane, wept for the folly of humankind.
[01:20:50.102 --> 01:20:52.083]  Forgive them, Father, they know not what they do.
[01:20:53.652 --> 01:20:55.533]  You can feel energetically in the universe.
[01:20:55.653 --> 01:20:58.594]  Great crossroads for the future of our species is here.
[01:20:59.075 --> 01:21:00.075]  I was not coming in today.
[01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:01.156]  I'm not complaining.
[01:21:01.176 --> 01:21:02.496]  I'm just saying that's how important this is.
[01:21:02.516 --> 01:21:05.658]  But what I learned from Zach, whose identity I know...
[01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:15.793]  After 12 people, including Michael Caputo, that came on on Monday, the only one that had the courage to do it, not knocking the others, to say, yeah, it's crazy, you're like a main focus.
[01:21:16.373 --> 01:21:22.936]  With Zach, who's just been a caller, and then I confirmed who he was, because he was saying stuff I knew that was really on target.
[01:21:23.476 --> 01:21:26.358]  He's probably been on like 10 times or something since I learned who he was.
[01:21:27.078 --> 01:21:33.061]  They claimed Roger and I, with Trump, are quarterbacking this, and that Zach's the traitor in the military.
[01:21:33.081 --> 01:21:34.942]  And I actually say,
[01:21:36.926 --> 01:21:39.689]  We were going to progress America until Alex stopped it.
[01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:42.673]  I've learned from other people they're doing this.
[01:21:42.693 --> 01:21:44.375]  People go, what are you talking about?
[01:21:44.435 --> 01:21:45.656]  Alex Jones is a talk show host.
[01:21:45.937 --> 01:21:47.659]  Yeah, he's big, but he's not running it.
[01:21:48.199 --> 01:21:49.561]  So now they're going to move.
[01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:51.864]  They basically told Zach from collusion.
[01:21:53.476 --> 01:21:57.159]  To just being involved in campaigns is illegal.
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:02.725]  Or you ordered a ham sandwich on the wrong bank account or whatever, as Roger Stone was saying.
[01:22:03.205 --> 01:22:06.688]  And then Tommy Robinson's secretly arrested and disappeared into prison.
[01:22:07.549 --> 01:22:09.811]  And all of that craziness is going on.
[01:22:10.091 --> 01:22:12.313]  And we've got his crew coming on tomorrow.
[01:22:12.774 --> 01:22:14.595]  And just all this insanity, it's like...
[01:22:15.336 --> 01:22:20.740]  The deep state is freaking out that humanity and America woke up and said, we don't like you.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:25.583]  So they're now just going completely hysterical, Roger.
[01:22:25.783 --> 01:22:32.788]  So let's talk about them honing in on you and what you said yesterday on the Sunday show, that they're openly trying to frame you.
[01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.509]  You've now talked to folks they've talked to.
[01:22:34.529 --> 01:22:36.571]  It is clear where they're going.
[01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:39.593]  They are completely desperate and the Mueller noose
[01:22:40.632 --> 01:22:46.978]  We now learn, is focusing on Roger Stone, and I know you're not involved in anything, but me?
[01:22:47.338 --> 01:22:48.800]  I mean, that is next level.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:23:04.394]  They're so crazy, Roger, that they think they're gonna say, I'm this foreign agent, and the smart money's on, like Mueller does with his anthrax stuff and other things, kill us before we can ever testify.
[01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:06.196]  The word is Mueller's gonna kill us.
[01:23:07.708 --> 01:23:21.975]  Well, Alex, first of all, let me touch on something you said earlier, because as you pointed out, my my beloved wife, Nydia, the rock in my life, literally my soulmate, has been in and out of the hospital after emergency surgery.
[01:23:22.555 --> 01:23:32.060]  And I want to report to the InfoWars audience that thanks to your prayers and your well wishes, she is home, she is doing well, and she's on the mend.
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:33.981]  There were some setbacks.
[01:23:34.201 --> 01:23:35.901]  So thank you so much.
[01:23:36.042 --> 01:23:36.882]  Prayer works.
[01:23:37.338 --> 01:23:40.240]  You lifted her up with prayer, and we are grateful.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:52.528]  Now, I think it's absolutely clear that Mr. Mueller is now sifting through literally every molecule of my being with this microscopic, fine-toothed comb.
[01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:57.071]  Look at my private life, my personal life, my family life.
[01:23:57.091 --> 01:23:59.793]  And if we know of 13 people, it's probably 500.
[01:24:01.681 --> 01:24:03.402]  Well, that's absolutely right.
[01:24:03.562 --> 01:24:05.382]  Most of them under 25 years old.
[01:24:05.422 --> 01:24:18.047]  So these are young people that I employ because I use an army of young entrepreneurs, graphics, people's researchers, writers, cameramen, gaffers, and so on.
[01:24:18.507 --> 01:24:23.849]  These people have been terrorized by some of the special counsel's people.
[01:24:23.909 --> 01:24:29.051]  And it's abundantly clear there is one theme in every interview.
[01:24:29.251 --> 01:24:29.892]  Really, two.
[01:24:30.772 --> 01:24:30.872]  One.
[01:24:31.468 --> 01:24:33.971]  Tell us about Stone's involvement with Alex Jones.
[01:24:34.471 --> 01:24:38.355]  Two, do you think that Stone will testify against the president?
[01:24:38.896 --> 01:24:41.118]  That's very clearly where they're going.
[01:24:41.238 --> 01:24:44.742]  Now, I don't know what Michael Cohen will do.
[01:24:45.462 --> 01:24:47.545]  I don't know what Michael Cohen has done.
[01:24:47.565 --> 01:24:50.267]  I don't know what Michael Cohen knows.
[01:24:50.788 --> 01:24:51.789]  But I do know this.
[01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:53.771]  I am no rat.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:06.986]  I will not bear false witness against this president to get myself off the hook for some fabricated, bogus offense that they cook up as leverage to get me to roll on the president.
[01:25:07.926 --> 01:25:14.370]  But they are counting on the fact that I don't have the financial resources to fight an extraordinary Congress.
[01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:16.110]  And that's why we're going to have a fundraiser next week.
[01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:17.931]  We're going to focus like a laser beam and do that.
[01:25:18.432 --> 01:25:19.092]  I totally agree.
[01:25:19.112 --> 01:25:20.533]  We're going to get that after the break.
[01:25:20.553 --> 01:25:21.173]  But here's the thing.
[01:25:23.052 --> 01:25:27.334]  This is quite an honor to be, like, this is what the deep state's got, us.
[01:25:27.794 --> 01:25:29.054]  Their whole thing's come up empty.
[01:25:29.134 --> 01:25:30.215]  They're in bed with the Russians.
[01:25:30.535 --> 01:25:31.995]  They're in bed with the communist Chinese.
[01:25:32.355 --> 01:25:32.896]  They're in bed.
[01:25:32.936 --> 01:25:34.956]  This really shows, but it is surreal.
[01:25:34.976 --> 01:25:39.418]  I used to tell you, like, a year and a half ago, relax, it's all bull, you know, so what?
[01:25:39.818 --> 01:25:44.340]  Now when it's happening to me, you finally get how crazy they are that
[01:25:45.558 --> 01:26:05.077]  Hillary and Soros and all these mummies, all these crypt keepers, cultural crypt keepers, are literally thinking this is going to fly, that Alex Jones is a Russian agent, and the FBI is going to arrest him, because that's what they were telling Zach is, we're going to get your boss, we know he's a Russian, you're all going to prison.
[01:26:05.597 --> 01:26:07.959]  And the guy's laughing at him, he's an army officer.
[01:26:08.219 --> 01:26:09.501]  This is cuckoo town.
[01:26:11.104 --> 01:26:22.727]  Well, but Alex, I think it's very important to recognize the extent to which this is all egged on by irresponsible fake news media outlets like MSNBC, CNN,
[01:26:24.096 --> 01:26:34.901]  The Daily Beast, Slate, Salon, HuffPo, The Wall Street Journal with a relentless drumbeat repeating again and again.
[01:26:35.261 --> 01:26:37.943]  Stone must have known about the WikiLeaks disclosure.
[01:26:38.003 --> 01:26:40.184]  Stone must have been trafficking with Assange.
[01:26:40.464 --> 01:26:42.365]  Stone must be a Russian agent.
[01:26:43.185 --> 01:26:45.787]  Jones must have been in touch with the Russians.
[01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:50.769]  Jones' operation is promoted by Russian bots, after all.
[01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.310]  So I kind of know
[01:26:53.004 --> 01:26:59.687]  How the Christians felt in the Coliseum when the crowd was screaming for the release of the Lions.
[01:27:00.207 --> 01:27:07.351]  The Ari Melbers and the other despicable losers who keep promulgating the same lie.
[01:27:07.391 --> 01:27:09.251]  But he must have known about Wifty Lakes.
[01:27:09.692 --> 01:27:13.513]  I think this drives the special counsel forward.
[01:27:14.294 --> 01:27:21.117]  Yet still they come up empty handed in this phony narrative.
[01:27:22.845 --> 01:27:23.346]  I agree.
[01:27:23.426 --> 01:27:24.528]  It shows the desperation.
[01:27:24.568 --> 01:27:26.511]  Trump's winning, the economy's coming back, all of it.
[01:27:26.911 --> 01:27:28.053]  What do you expect them to do, though?
[01:27:28.073 --> 01:27:28.814]  They're not giving up.
[01:27:28.854 --> 01:27:31.438]  They are massively intensifying their attacks.
[01:27:32.827 --> 01:27:45.413]  Well, I think that there's increasing panic based on new research put forward by Mark Levin and promoted by Sean Hannity that the very appointment of Mueller is unconstitutional and could be challenged in the courts.
[01:27:45.953 --> 01:27:47.754]  This is the last thing they want to hear.
[01:27:48.194 --> 01:27:53.216]  Look, I am a supporter of Rudy Giuliani in his role as the president's lawyer.
[01:27:53.656 --> 01:27:56.677]  Now, suddenly you see a new combativeness by the president.
[01:27:57.078 --> 01:28:01.260]  You see him taking the deep state to the woodshed about Spygate.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:08.483]  You see Giuliani questioning the partisan nature, again today, of the Mueller Inquisition.
[01:28:09.563 --> 01:28:11.884]  This is not an inquiry.
[01:28:11.944 --> 01:28:15.186]  This is not a legitimate legal proceeding.
[01:28:15.286 --> 01:28:16.746]  This is an Inquisition.
[01:28:17.907 --> 01:28:19.868]  And Robert Mueller is Torquemada.
[01:28:21.107 --> 01:28:27.092]  Now let's be clear, there is a civil war against the globalist chi-com interest in America.
[01:28:27.572 --> 01:28:29.473]  They're the globalists trying to sell the country out.
[01:28:30.014 --> 01:28:34.017]  Just like we're persecuted and sued and attacked, it's the same way America is.
[01:28:34.077 --> 01:28:37.119]  It's all been gang up on America, sell out America.
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.544]  That's what the globalists have done, and that's all coming to an end, and they are crapping their little panties over it.
[01:28:44.205 --> 01:28:47.947]  We're going to do a few more segments with Roger Stone straight ahead about where we're going after this.
[01:28:48.328 --> 01:28:49.148]  Tommy Robinson,
[01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:52.650]  Inside Intel on that huge breaking news.
[01:28:53.050 --> 01:28:54.510]  It's all coming up straight ahead.

[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:30.180]  We all do.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:34.542]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[01:31:34.562 --> 01:31:35.983]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[01:31:36.203 --> 01:31:40.105]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[01:31:40.125 --> 01:31:47.809]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.

[01:33:06.241 --> 01:33:08.963]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.077 --> 01:33:31.323]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.457 --> 01:33:36.978]  You know, a lot of folks have history run over them.
[01:33:38.058 --> 01:33:40.599]  And they get up and they dust themselves off and pretend it never happened.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:45.161]  But some people have destiny run over them and they wake up and become part of it.
[01:33:45.541 --> 01:33:49.903]  That's a paraphrase of a Winston Churchill quote.
[01:33:50.803 --> 01:33:52.084]  Roger Stone's my guest here.
[01:33:52.104 --> 01:33:55.605]  We're going to rebroadcast in the third and fourth hour like we were planning.
[01:33:55.725 --> 01:34:00.507]  I drove in today with kids ready to fish, ready to have a great day at the lake, because
[01:34:01.681 --> 01:34:09.186]  I mean, you're talking to army people, you're talking to others, and they're saying, yeah, the FBI's here saying we're all in a conspiracy, we overthrew the government, we're criminals.
[01:34:10.066 --> 01:34:11.207]  This is even Russian now.
[01:34:11.227 --> 01:34:17.431]  It's like saying, and you're a Muppet, and you're on Sesame Street, or you're a Chinese jet pilot from the moon.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.301]  You're like, you're joking, right?
[01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:23.884]  No, we know you were through the government.
[01:34:23.904 --> 01:34:24.885]  We're going to put you in prison.
[01:34:26.226 --> 01:34:32.373]  It's so comical that they've got this many criminals in the government and the FBI is this corrupt.
[01:34:32.413 --> 01:34:35.536]  Like you don't even, it makes you not want to be an American anymore.
[01:34:37.128 --> 01:34:37.948]  That's their plan.
[01:34:38.009 --> 01:34:41.290]  It's just so demoralizing, so criminal.
[01:34:41.331 --> 01:34:43.452]  But they've had decades to hire criminals.
[01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:44.672]  They've had decades.
[01:34:44.693 --> 01:34:45.833]  So we can't give up on the country.
[01:34:46.333 --> 01:34:47.614]  Trump's saying, don't give up on it.
[01:34:47.654 --> 01:34:48.375]  We're not giving up.
[01:34:48.715 --> 01:34:50.336]  I've been on air an hour and a half, haven't plugged.
[01:34:51.617 --> 01:34:55.439]  If you don't finance Soros and Hillary and all their fake lawsuits, we'll win.
[01:34:55.479 --> 01:34:57.180]  But why would you let them win?

[01:35:36.749 --> 01:35:41.010]  But if you don't understand it's a financial and information war, they will win.
[01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:42.591]  That's why they want to make you poor.
[01:35:43.071 --> 01:35:44.772]  The globalist plan is to make America poor.
[01:35:45.192 --> 01:35:47.093]  Just like they're attacking Infowars to make us poor.
[01:35:47.273 --> 01:35:48.133]  It's a plan.
[01:35:49.764 --> 01:35:50.805]  InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:35:55.510 --> 01:35:58.494]  So, Roger, closing out here so you can spend some time with your family.
[01:35:58.594 --> 01:35:59.615]  I just had to come in.
[01:35:59.635 --> 01:36:02.799]  This is like a boxer being punched and not fighting back.
[01:36:02.859 --> 01:36:03.680]  You learn.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:05.722]  We already knew.
[01:36:05.742 --> 01:36:07.544]  And we know it's a fraud.
[01:36:07.644 --> 01:36:08.825]  And they're the globalists.
[01:36:08.885 --> 01:36:09.686]  They're the enemies.
[01:36:10.603 --> 01:36:11.944]  They're running out of gas.
[01:36:11.964 --> 01:36:13.706]  The economy's starting to come back.
[01:36:14.026 --> 01:36:15.447]  They're trying to suppress that.
[01:36:16.168 --> 01:36:17.649]  They're trying to cause race war.
[01:36:17.769 --> 01:36:20.171]  They're trying to cause war in North Korea.
[01:36:20.271 --> 01:36:26.916]  It's just they're so criminal and their own followers, Roger, aren't even getting anything out of it.
[01:36:29.078 --> 01:36:38.546]  You know, Alex, there comes a time when you go to battle and you will either return home carrying your shield or you will return home being carried on it.
[01:36:39.696 --> 01:36:40.557]  I'm ready to fight.
[01:36:41.417 --> 01:36:45.641]  I think that I am about to be punished for my support for Donald Trump.
[01:36:45.881 --> 01:36:54.988]  My crime is advocating the election of a non-globalist president, the billionaire businessman reformer, Donald J. Trump.
[01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:56.670]  That is what I am guilty of.
[01:36:57.550 --> 01:37:09.280]  And the screaming hyenas of the far left, the MSNBCs, the Mother Joneses, the other fake news media have been screaming for my blood.
[01:37:09.815 --> 01:37:10.335]  Four months.
[01:37:11.095 --> 01:37:16.377]  They're now trying to dig up old girlfriends to try to get them to bear false witness against me.
[01:37:16.397 --> 01:37:17.117]  Oh, believe me, I know.
[01:37:17.517 --> 01:37:23.599]  But I love that Spartan quote, because the women would tell him, even after, you come home with your shills are on them.
[01:37:23.619 --> 01:37:25.159]  It was in a war, you drop them when you're running.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:27.780]  You come home with your shills are on them.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:29.621]  I want that culture.
[01:37:29.941 --> 01:37:31.041]  That's what I want out of women.
[01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:33.782]  Not a bunch of sycophantic cowards like everybody's become.
[01:37:35.097 --> 01:37:37.818]  Well, I think it's a great quote from Plutarch.
[01:37:38.359 --> 01:37:41.040]  You mentioned it, so I'm going to take the opportunity.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:51.945]  People ask me how I intend to face up to this onslaught from Mueller and his all-powerful gumshoes and his prosecutors.
[01:37:52.185 --> 01:37:53.366]  The answer is very simple.
[01:37:54.066 --> 01:37:59.949]  I'm going to follow the rules in this book, Stone's Rules, available at the Infowars.com store.
[01:38:00.409 --> 01:38:02.650]  My whole battle plan is in this book.
[01:38:03.243 --> 01:38:05.624]  The way I'm going to handle this is in this book.
[01:38:06.064 --> 01:38:10.106]  Not with my tail between my legs, but as a fighter, as a warrior.
[01:38:10.686 --> 01:38:16.489]  But I'm going to need your help and the help of everybody listening, because this is going to be an epic battle.
[01:38:16.649 --> 01:38:26.053]  Roger Stone, Alex Jones, and other patriots, like General Mike Flynn, we have no intention of being just mowed over.
[01:38:26.454 --> 01:38:27.374]  Not happening.
[01:38:30.225 --> 01:38:34.086]  Don't people get America was founded with, come back with your shields are on them?
[01:38:34.546 --> 01:38:37.827]  Everyone's so sycophantic and, oh, let's grovel.
[01:38:37.867 --> 01:38:41.089]  Let's, oh, go to another movie, eat some more food, party more.
[01:38:41.329 --> 01:38:42.589]  And then everything's degrading.
[01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:43.409]  There's no soul.
[01:38:43.809 --> 01:38:45.230]  My soul feels strong, actually.
[01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:46.490]  Everybody's all freaked out.
[01:38:46.610 --> 01:38:47.451]  Zach's a great guy.
[01:38:47.471 --> 01:38:50.752]  He's all freaked out with them threatening him and let's go.
[01:38:50.772 --> 01:38:55.213]  I mean, like Tommy Robinson, he knows he's making history right now.
[01:38:55.453 --> 01:38:56.393]  He exists.
[01:38:56.694 --> 01:38:57.634]  He's standing up against
[01:38:58.634 --> 01:39:03.579]  Hundreds of thousands of little girls being sex trafficked by pedophiles raping them all day.
[01:39:03.779 --> 01:39:10.785]  When they get pregnant, they kill a lot of little girls and then they feed them in the Islamic kebab machines as a big Islamic joke.
[01:39:11.165 --> 01:39:12.006]  That's been confirmed.
[01:39:12.306 --> 01:39:14.689]  I mean, my God, that's the normal behavior.
[01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:16.770]  We're all Tommy Robinson.
[01:39:17.011 --> 01:39:18.292]  We want ramming speed.
[01:39:18.412 --> 01:39:19.032]  Let's go!
[01:39:19.913 --> 01:39:24.456]  I just hope if they shoot me in the head or something, and I'm a vegetable in the hospital, you'll come pull the plug.
[01:39:24.656 --> 01:39:25.317]  I'm ready!
[01:39:25.717 --> 01:39:26.237]  I'm ready!
[01:39:26.438 --> 01:39:26.978]  I want it!
[01:39:27.058 --> 01:39:27.618]  Let's go!
[01:39:27.979 --> 01:39:29.239]  Let's go, Mueller!
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:29.960]  Let's go!
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:48.933]  Well, Alex, one of the reasons why I think I'm being targeted is because in my book, The Clinton's War on Women, I very, very extensively expose Jeffrey Epstein, and I question why Epstein, who was serially assaulting, sexually assaulting underage girls,
[01:39:49.409 --> 01:39:55.552]  And trafficking underage children to other pedophiles was never prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
[01:39:55.593 --> 01:39:59.475]  That he was allowed to plead to one state charge of solicitation.
[01:39:59.515 --> 01:40:01.596]  Well he should have been hung up by his neck.
[01:40:01.996 --> 01:40:05.078]  He should have been hung up by his filthy little chicken neck till it popped!
[01:40:06.089 --> 01:40:07.290]  But we now know the answer.
[01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:14.615]  He was an FBI informant under Robert Mueller, under FBI Director Robert Mueller.
[01:40:14.896 --> 01:40:23.102]  And we now have actual evidence of FBI files saying, as long as he is spilling his guts to us, we won't prosecute him for his crimes.
[01:40:23.542 --> 01:40:25.704]  This is why they are targeting Roger Stone.
[01:40:26.084 --> 01:40:30.047]  I have been talking about the Bushes and the Clintons and the Deep State.
[01:40:30.447 --> 01:40:36.911]  And the Clinton Foundation and the ignominious corruption of John Podesta and the Clinton Combine.
[01:40:37.372 --> 01:40:39.793]  And that is why they want to silence me.
[01:40:40.053 --> 01:40:41.995]  It's why they want to close down InfoWars.
[01:40:42.075 --> 01:40:51.761]  It's why they're suing you and Sandy Hook and a dozen other bogus, harassment, frivolous, but expensive lawsuits.
[01:40:52.382 --> 01:40:54.123]  This is their new tactic.
[01:40:54.503 --> 01:40:56.044]  Smear and frame.
[01:40:56.364 --> 01:40:58.045]  That's exactly what they have in mind.
[01:40:58.445 --> 01:40:59.046]  I'm a fighter.
[01:40:59.562 --> 01:41:00.483]  I choose to fight.
[01:41:00.923 --> 01:41:01.904]  I know you're a fighter.
[01:41:02.365 --> 01:41:03.666]  I know you choose to fight.
[01:41:04.006 --> 01:41:08.671]  The question is, those who are listening and watching us, what will you do now?
[01:41:09.091 --> 01:41:10.533]  The revolution is now.
[01:41:10.653 --> 01:41:12.034]  The war is now.
[01:41:12.595 --> 01:41:16.358]  We're ready to fight, but we cannot fight without your support.
[01:41:16.578 --> 01:41:17.820]  I love it.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.721]  You're quoting Greek philosophers and
[01:41:21.912 --> 01:41:23.193]  Patrick Henry at the same time.
[01:41:23.233 --> 01:41:24.193]  I'm drooling at this point.
[01:41:24.273 --> 01:41:24.954]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:25.534 --> 01:41:26.294]  I've forgotten about that.
[01:41:26.314 --> 01:41:27.595]  We should make a bigger deal out of that.
[01:41:28.155 --> 01:41:43.664]  Robert Mueller on record had Epstein, the pedophile airplane billionaire, flying kids around with Obama and Harvey Weinstein and going to these Islamic bases as well, where they have these harems of little kids.
[01:41:44.344 --> 01:41:48.027]  And Mueller had him as a, quote, informant, framing everyone.
[01:41:48.487 --> 01:41:54.191]  Robert Mueller is the pedophile kingpin protecting Lolita Express and Epstein.
[01:41:54.592 --> 01:41:57.274]  I mean, my God, what a demon!
[01:41:57.694 --> 01:41:59.115]  What a hellspawn!
[01:41:59.495 --> 01:42:06.621]  And all the left protecting him, they're now on board with the protection of pedophilia and the arrest of Tommy Robinson.
[01:42:06.921 --> 01:42:10.324]  Doesn't it all come into focus as the Deputy Pope
[01:42:11.104 --> 01:42:16.106]  For trafficking a hundred little boys, reportedly, he's in a secret trial in Australia as well.
[01:42:16.526 --> 01:42:22.147]  Doesn't it all come into focus right now before we drop our big torpedoes?
[01:42:25.108 --> 01:42:26.729]  Roger Stone, great job, my friend.
[01:42:26.749 --> 01:42:29.890]  We will have you back as soon as possible.
[01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:33.131]  I know you think they're fake indictments and frame-ups are coming soon.
[01:42:33.591 --> 01:42:38.272]  All I can say is, damn the maneuvers, go straight at them, and we've only begun to fight.
[01:42:38.633 --> 01:42:39.613]  I salute you, my friend.
[01:42:40.753 --> 01:42:45.996]  Great to be here, Alex, and after they come after me, they're definitely coming after you.
[01:42:46.336 --> 01:42:47.537]  I look forward to it.
[01:42:47.997 --> 01:42:49.858]  God, it's good to stand up against pedophiles.
[01:42:50.638 --> 01:42:51.258]  We'll be back.
[01:42:51.779 --> 01:42:54.540]  Roseanne Barr tweeted, they arrested Tommy Robinson for fighting pedophiles.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.841]  They will not stop us.
[01:42:56.101 --> 01:42:57.041]  You can smell victory.
[01:42:57.361 --> 01:42:58.922]  Accelerate to attack speed.
[01:42:58.962 --> 01:42:59.482]  We'll be back.
[01:42:59.503 --> 01:43:00.003]  Spread the links.
[01:43:02.408 --> 01:43:05.591]  Infowars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:43:05.611 --> 01:43:07.352]  We're really, really proud of it.

[01:43:54.609 --> 01:43:57.172]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:43:57.913 --> 01:43:59.875]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[01:44:00.455 --> 01:44:01.216]  Get yours today.

[01:44:02.878 --> 01:44:06.081]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:44:06.521 --> 01:44:07.783]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:44:08.303 --> 01:44:08.943]  We're good to go!
[01:44:26.049 --> 01:44:29.450]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:35.693]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:44:35.913 --> 01:44:40.574]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:44:41.075 --> 01:44:43.395]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:44:43.735 --> 01:44:45.076]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:44:45.476 --> 01:44:50.358]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[01:44:50.578 --> 01:44:55.061]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:44:55.181 --> 01:44:57.322]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:44:57.863 --> 01:45:02.746]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:45:02.946 --> 01:45:06.768]  With Alpha Power by Infowarslife, you can be in charge of your energy again.

[01:45:12.272 --> 01:45:12.772]  Alpha Power.
[01:45:12.972 --> 01:45:15.913]  It's a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:16.193 --> 01:45:19.734]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[01:45:20.074 --> 01:45:23.175]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[01:45:23.415 --> 01:45:32.817]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin, and it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[01:45:32.917 --> 01:45:35.238]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[01:45:35.478 --> 01:45:37.179]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:40.022]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible.
[01:45:40.282 --> 01:45:44.826]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time.
[01:45:45.146 --> 01:45:51.211]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[01:45:51.651 --> 01:45:56.174]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[01:45:56.654 --> 01:45:57.794]  That helps with focus, too.
[01:45:58.235 --> 01:45:59.215]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[01:45:59.715 --> 01:46:03.838]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[01:46:04.238 --> 01:46:08.300]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.101]  There's definitely been a change.
[01:46:10.361 --> 01:46:11.002]  For the better.
[01:46:11.442 --> 01:46:15.224]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[01:46:15.604 --> 01:46:17.265]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[01:46:17.705 --> 01:46:18.566]  I hope this lasts.
[01:46:19.426 --> 01:46:21.487]  One Eyed Jack says, Alpha Power.
[01:46:21.787 --> 01:46:27.909]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes, I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:33.111]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:36.913]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[01:46:37.493 --> 01:46:42.535]  Taking one capsule a day in the a.m., and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[01:46:43.095 --> 01:46:44.896]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[01:46:45.176 --> 01:46:45.696]  Not anymore.
[01:46:46.077 --> 01:46:47.277]  Seem to be sleeping better, too.
[01:46:47.837 --> 01:46:49.658]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[01:46:49.918 --> 01:46:51.279]  I will definitely buy this again.
[01:46:52.059 --> 01:46:55.421]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[01:46:56.101 --> 01:46:58.302]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:06.326 --> 01:47:08.927]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.378 --> 01:47:29.127]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:33.499 --> 01:47:35.240]  Well, this is very, very different.
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:37.480]  I've been with Tommy for about a year and a half now.
[01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:38.681]  We've gone to lots of protests.
[01:47:38.701 --> 01:47:40.781]  We've been to universities.
[01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:42.442]  We've been around the UK.
[01:47:42.822 --> 01:47:45.763]  But something very different has happened.
[01:47:46.423 --> 01:47:50.204]  And that's that people are now absolutely furious about this.
[01:47:50.224 --> 01:47:54.786]  There's electricity almost in the air of people who have completely had enough of all of it.
[01:48:00.214 --> 01:48:04.978]  It's now confirmed that Europe is being forcibly merged under the EU with Islam.
[01:48:05.098 --> 01:48:07.080]  There's deals made with Saudi Arabia and others.
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:10.323]  Saudi Arabia's come out and said, we've been told to build mosques in Europe.
[01:48:10.723 --> 01:48:11.704]  We've been told to do this.
[01:48:11.724 --> 01:48:12.765]  It's what the Catholic Church wants.
[01:48:12.925 --> 01:48:14.627]  It's what the new Pope wants.
[01:48:14.727 --> 01:48:15.628]  They want abortion.
[01:48:16.588 --> 01:48:17.950]  Ireland just legalized abortion.
[01:48:19.011 --> 01:48:20.173]  It'll be a sacrament soon.
[01:48:20.914 --> 01:48:24.899]  Well, Kalen Robertson has been there when this happened to Tommy.
[01:48:25.299 --> 01:48:30.065]  He's been covering the live events as they scaled the gates there at 10 Downing Street.
[01:48:30.105 --> 01:48:31.327]  Almost total news blackout.
[01:48:31.748 --> 01:48:32.829]  Now they're at Speaker's Corner.
[01:48:32.869 --> 01:48:35.432]  He just got back to his place after all of this.
[01:48:36.673 --> 01:48:47.655]  They're in London, and if you just joined us on all those radio and TV stations out there, I think it's better if Kalen describes to you, just in a snapshot, who Tommy is.
[01:48:47.735 --> 01:48:49.275]  Most people know, now they do.
[01:48:49.895 --> 01:49:03.758]  And then the order that the press, thousands of different comments online, taken down, hundreds of mainstream news articles from BBC, Sky Television, just deleted the articles and said, we've been given a de-notice.
[01:49:04.398 --> 01:49:06.660]  So, again, England is not as free as folks think.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.962]  Certainly, none of you are actually someone from there.
[01:49:10.783 --> 01:49:12.084]  So, thank you for coming on.
[01:49:12.144 --> 01:49:16.207]  You're at Kaylen Robb on Twitter.
[01:49:16.628 --> 01:49:23.313]  And, of course, also are the main contributor with the work and the great work we see there at TommyRobinsonOnline.com.
[01:49:23.553 --> 01:49:24.754]  So, thank you for coming on with us, sir.
[01:49:25.982 --> 01:49:26.782]  Oh, thanks for having me.
[01:49:26.802 --> 01:49:30.763]  And you very accurately described what's been going on in this country in the last few days.
[01:49:30.943 --> 01:49:32.724]  We've seen news articles completely wiped out.
[01:49:32.764 --> 01:49:39.326]  I've spoken to journalists who are really, really keen for information, who have then later said, sorry, we had to pull the whole story.
[01:49:39.346 --> 01:49:40.646]  We can't talk about any of this.
[01:49:41.287 --> 01:49:43.767]  It is very, very, very, very worrying.
[01:49:44.147 --> 01:49:45.728]  There were even journalists, I mean,
[01:49:46.548 --> 01:49:49.152]  There's lots of technicalities about what I can and can't talk about.
[01:49:49.192 --> 01:49:51.636]  I was in the courtroom when all of this happened.
[01:49:51.776 --> 01:49:53.159]  Obviously, there's a reporting restriction.
[01:49:53.619 --> 01:49:58.807]  But, you know, when the judge even said that there's a reporting restriction, they closed the books.
[01:49:58.847 --> 01:49:58.947]  They
[01:50:00.538 --> 01:50:04.902]  They wouldn't report on it after that, and it's a very, very, very bizarre situation.
[01:50:05.403 --> 01:50:20.036]  Usually reporting restrictions like this are only placed in very, very extreme cases, very, very high-profile cases, and there's not really any reasoning for them to do this, in this particular scenario, other than so that people don't know that they've done something wrong.
[01:50:21.196 --> 01:50:23.617]  Thank God that you guys are reporting it.
[01:50:23.637 --> 01:50:26.378]  Thank God InfoWars is making a deal out of it.
[01:50:26.418 --> 01:50:28.218]  And I think Fox News have just spoken about it.
[01:50:29.299 --> 01:50:31.059]  And that information is going to the UK.
[01:50:31.259 --> 01:50:35.160]  Thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people have been rioting and protesting about this now.
[01:50:35.361 --> 01:50:36.821]  They've all been talking about it in the streets.
[01:50:37.101 --> 01:50:42.483]  And that information is getting to the general public, despite their attempts to stop it.
[01:50:42.943 --> 01:50:43.323]  And so
[01:50:44.284 --> 01:50:49.326]  Hopefully the ball will just keep rolling and more and more people will look to the US to find out information about this.
[01:50:49.606 --> 01:50:58.469]  But in this country, the situation, how it feels, going to pick up a copy of the local newspaper, going to look on any articles, there's a complete blackout.
[01:50:58.489 --> 01:50:59.450]  We can't see anything.
[01:50:59.470 --> 01:51:01.571]  The only people talking about it are people on Twitter.
[01:51:01.651 --> 01:51:03.971]  It's actually very strange.
[01:51:04.031 --> 01:51:05.312]  It's a massive news story.
[01:51:05.692 --> 01:51:07.593]  And it's completely unreported.
[01:51:08.053 --> 01:51:11.975]  The feeling in this country right now is absolutely bizarre.
[01:51:12.035 --> 01:51:15.137]  It's intensified the mistrust in the media.
[01:51:15.197 --> 01:51:16.317]  People are furious.
[01:51:16.597 --> 01:51:25.902]  I actually met someone today who is from the left, who works for a very left-wing, very well-known media outlet, and they said they've never seen anger like this before.
[01:51:25.942 --> 01:51:28.443]  They said it's actually very, very worrying where this could go.
[01:51:28.463 --> 01:51:31.045]  If something happens to Tommy in prison,
[01:51:32.345 --> 01:51:33.927]  Sorry, I'm just in the middle of something.
[01:51:51.528 --> 01:52:05.742]  And we're talking about an iron curtain of censorship that's taking place and multiple levels of a total power grab with political correctness where they arrest police chiefs that talk about Muslim rapes in Sweden, where the Stasi has been reactivated and works for Facebook.
[01:52:05.983 --> 01:52:08.946]  You can't make this up to arrest people that criticize Islam.
[01:52:09.566 --> 01:52:10.667]  Twitter and Facebook help.
[01:52:11.528 --> 01:52:16.832]  The government of Pakistan find people that are atheists, they call it blasphemy, and they are executed.
[01:52:16.852 --> 01:52:24.657]  You have to understand, Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, Google, especially Apple, they're already working with the Communist Chinese rounding up the Christians and Buddhists.
[01:52:24.977 --> 01:52:28.660]  They're already working helping the Arab Spring throw gays off buildings.
[01:52:29.140 --> 01:52:30.060]  The West funded that.
[01:52:30.461 --> 01:52:39.247]  The elites are allied with Islam, because there's 1.8 million of them, the West is dying, and the decision hasn't been made to rehabilitate the Muslims and bring them into the West.
[01:52:39.547 --> 01:52:41.068]  I don't care if they got brown skin, a bunch of them.
[01:52:42.048 --> 01:52:45.489]  But their culture is pure, absolute evil, many of them.
[01:52:46.169 --> 01:52:49.711]  The biggest threat to a Muslim is other Muslims, as you know, Kalen.
[01:52:49.731 --> 01:52:52.691]  So get into... I understand this Iron Curtain of Tyranny.
[01:52:53.572 --> 01:53:00.474]  He simply reported that they were having, as you know, huge trials on the child kidnapping rings that he had first exposed.
[01:53:00.994 --> 01:53:01.234]  I think?
[01:53:19.065 --> 01:53:24.207]  And then they order everyone not to talk about it, period, and denotice hundreds of publications.
[01:53:24.808 --> 01:53:30.590]  As you said, talking to the members of the press, this is unprecedented, and we have seen thousands hit the streets.
[01:53:30.850 --> 01:53:33.952]  Describe what you've witnessed, the level of awakening here.
[01:53:34.252 --> 01:53:36.273]  This is beyond the old Soviet Union.
[01:53:37.554 --> 01:53:39.315]  Well, this is very, very different.
[01:53:39.455 --> 01:53:41.557]  I've been with Tommy for about a year and a half now.
[01:53:41.577 --> 01:53:42.757]  We've gone to lots of protests.
[01:53:43.058 --> 01:53:44.879]  We've been to universities.
[01:53:44.899 --> 01:53:46.520]  We've been around the UK.
[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:49.842]  But something very different has happened.
[01:53:50.503 --> 01:53:54.285]  And that's that people are now absolutely furious about this.
[01:53:54.325 --> 01:53:58.888]  There's electricity almost in the air of people who have completely had enough of all of it.
[01:53:59.328 --> 01:54:01.050]  You're right about what you said with
[01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:07.393]  People being terrified, and the establishment, and our very establishment, and our police being terrified about reporting on these grooming gang scandals.
[01:54:07.633 --> 01:54:16.998]  We haven't seen press restrictions on any cases with, you know, people like Rolf Harris, and all these big, big, massive, high-profile cases with white pedophiles and things like that.
[01:54:17.038 --> 01:54:20.740]  We have the BBC with helicopters outside their house as soon as there's any accusations.
[01:54:21.160 --> 01:54:24.702]  This is completely unprecedented, and people can see straight through it.
[01:54:25.122 --> 01:54:28.704]  And you can feel the tension in the air of this country right now.
[01:54:28.724 --> 01:54:29.704]  You can cut it with a knife.
[01:54:30.125 --> 01:54:30.545]  It's so
[01:54:31.405 --> 01:54:32.687]  Intense.
[01:54:33.447 --> 01:54:37.491]  It's quite scary, actually, seeing where this could go.
[01:54:37.551 --> 01:54:42.916]  And obviously, if any harm comes to him, I can predict mass violence across the UK.
[01:54:42.956 --> 01:54:45.318]  I can predict towns and cities coming to a standstill.
[01:54:47.179 --> 01:54:50.022]  What's about to happen is a change
[01:54:51.832 --> 01:54:53.814]  In a way we have never seen before in this country.
[01:54:53.874 --> 01:54:55.615]  People, everything is shifting.
[01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:57.436]  There are journalists and there are mainstream people.
[01:54:57.477 --> 01:55:07.044]  I've had MPs and very, very high profile people contacting and talking to me and saying that they want to go straight out gun blazing and going against this but they'll probably lose everything.
[01:55:07.444 --> 01:55:12.669]  It's torn apart the fabric of the country right now and everything's sort of fractured.
[01:55:12.989 --> 01:55:15.371]  I can't really describe how insane all this is.
[01:55:15.891 --> 01:55:17.793]  I was in an LGBT
[01:55:18.753 --> 01:55:24.195]  You know, Barr the other day, yesterday, and everybody in there was talking about it.
[01:55:24.215 --> 01:55:29.857]  You've got fringe groups on the left, gays and transgender people, everybody shaking our hands and talking about this.
[01:55:30.097 --> 01:55:33.318]  It's united everybody who have been on the far left.
[01:55:34.958 --> 01:55:40.404]  Because the general public, whether you're liberal, conservative, black, white, whatever, you're against pedophilia.
[01:55:40.444 --> 01:55:41.466]  Even the average Muslim.
[01:55:41.866 --> 01:55:43.988]  But you've got this strand of Islam that does it.
[01:55:44.449 --> 01:55:45.490]  Sex traffic going on.
[01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:47.292]  Blacks being sold in cages in Libya.
[01:55:47.813 --> 01:55:48.273]  All this.
[01:55:48.393 --> 01:55:49.575]  And now we're finding out it's there.
[01:55:49.595 --> 01:55:52.718]  And as you said, they find a dead girl at Jimmy Savelle's place.
[01:55:52.978 --> 01:55:53.719]  It's national news.
[01:55:53.759 --> 01:55:54.200]  It should be.
[01:55:54.540 --> 01:55:58.442]  You've got helicopters at the Royal Palace when they find a dead kid buried in the backyard.
[01:55:58.842 --> 01:56:03.844]  But now, suddenly, there's a total blackout on these grooming gangs because, well, don't we know?
[01:56:03.924 --> 01:56:12.888]  It came out, what, a month ago before they did a blackout, that it turns out the major police and other social worker leaders were using the Muslims in many of these cases
[01:56:13.428 --> 01:56:14.149]  Don't say which ones.
[01:56:14.189 --> 01:56:14.729]  I know you can't.
[01:56:14.969 --> 01:56:16.611]  Even though it's in the news there, you'll be arrested.
[01:56:16.631 --> 01:56:17.371]  Think about that, folks.
[01:56:17.692 --> 01:56:18.412]  Delivering.
[01:56:18.612 --> 01:56:25.018]  They have the Muslims, like Renfield, some of the Muslims off the hook here, are delivering it to the pedo British elites.
[01:56:26.704 --> 01:56:29.305]  Well, they don't, yes, exactly, and they don't quite know what they've done.
[01:56:29.425 --> 01:56:39.611]  I think the people who have instigated this, the people who have orchestrated it, the people who thought it was a good idea to silence him, are so out of touch, they don't quite realise that it's not going to work.
[01:56:39.911 --> 01:56:43.173]  In 2007, at the beginning of the EDL, when Tommy was starting out,
[01:56:43.733 --> 01:56:47.036]  They used to use these very tactics.
[01:56:47.076 --> 01:56:49.738]  They used to silence him, they used to throw him in jail, and no one knew about it.
[01:56:49.758 --> 01:56:53.020]  There wasn't the internet, there wasn't social media, there was no one to cause outrage.
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:55.982]  You do a press blackout and nobody knows what's going on.
[01:56:56.403 --> 01:56:56.623]  Now!
[01:56:57.552 --> 01:56:59.514]  They do not realize what they have done.
[01:56:59.875 --> 01:57:06.121]  In fact, if they wouldn't have put this press back out, maybe not as many people would have known about this because it's caused such a scandal.
[01:57:06.341 --> 01:57:11.507]  They're so out of touch, they don't realize how this is going to erupt and how this is going to completely fail.
[01:57:11.867 --> 01:57:14.390]  This is unprecedented.
[01:57:14.450 --> 01:57:15.351]  So it's fair to say...
[01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:22.640]  I think you can mark this point as the beginning of the real explosion, the pushback against what's happening.
[01:57:22.660 --> 01:57:24.863]  They've jumped the metaphorical shark here.
[01:57:25.324 --> 01:57:28.408]  Folks know that these massive grooming scandals are happening in every city.
[01:57:28.728 --> 01:57:30.851]  They know Muslims and pedos are above the law.
[01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:32.954]  And folks are angry across the board.
[01:57:52.734 --> 01:58:00.601]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:58:00.981 --> 01:58:08.567]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:58:08.968 --> 01:58:13.231]  CNN and many others are calling for Infowars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:58:13.612 --> 01:58:15.774]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying,
[01:58:16.334 --> 01:58:17.535]  Go beyond censorship.
[01:58:17.715 --> 01:58:20.578]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:58:20.878 --> 01:58:25.101]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:58:25.982 --> 01:58:29.005]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:58:29.945 --> 01:58:34.709]  That's why it's more important than ever that folks stay in contact with InfoWars.
[01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:41.535]  If you sign up for our free newsletter that goes out daily at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:58:42.526 --> 01:58:53.519]  We will send you breaking videos, breaking articles, key analysis, and links to all of our podcasts, all of our live feeds, all of our live streams at the bottom.
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:54.401]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:59.387]  And we've got backups, so that we have that personal, direct relationship with you.
[01:59:00.067 --> 01:59:06.773]  I was never good about email and, you know, collecting folks' email like everybody else does because I was always going for the latest cutting-edge stuff.
[01:59:06.813 --> 01:59:07.413]  We still do that.
[01:59:07.814 --> 01:59:11.817]  But all the experts have told me, Alex, if they shut everything down, it gets really bad.
[01:59:12.317 --> 01:59:21.404]  You've got to have a thumb drive with those emails so you can contact the base core of patriots that understand what's happening, the real remnant.
[01:59:21.965 --> 01:59:26.589]  Now, we're hoping for the best, ladies and gentlemen, but we're also preparing for the worst.
[01:59:26.809 --> 01:59:29.431]  That's why it's so critical, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:59:29.531 --> 01:59:43.405]  But you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:59:43.645 --> 01:59:44.926]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:59:45.147 --> 01:59:51.393]  So please sign up for the free newsletter today and then share the emails with everyone you know to cause a chain reaction.
[01:59:57.244 --> 02:00:00.567]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:00.627 --> 02:00:03.149]  We are on the march.
[02:00:09.193 --> 02:00:12.956]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:00:13.176 --> 02:00:17.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:26.670 --> 02:00:30.674]  Coming up in 30 minutes, in studio, he is in the building.
[02:00:31.615 --> 02:00:34.517]  Michael Rotondo, one of the top stories this week.
[02:00:36.079 --> 02:00:42.805]  The individual who at 30 was evicted by a court from his parents' home, that he was not wanting to leave.
[02:00:44.046 --> 02:00:46.909]  He is going to be in studio with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:47.570 --> 02:00:50.733]  Here is a clip of him talking about it.
[02:00:51.854 --> 02:00:56.117]  This 30-year-old dude is facing an eviction threat from his own parents.
[02:00:56.377 --> 02:00:57.478]  That's just so ridiculous.
[02:00:57.938 --> 02:01:02.722]  Michael Rotundo's mom and dad are so fed up, they're suing to get him out of the house.
[02:01:03.222 --> 02:01:05.964]  I don't see why the judge wants to throw people out on the street.
[02:01:06.304 --> 02:01:13.049]  His parents filed the extraordinary lawsuit following months of repeated attempts to get him to leave their home in Syracuse, New York.
[02:01:13.469 --> 02:01:15.631]  And the story is getting lots of attention.
[02:01:15.891 --> 02:01:20.173]  A judge asked why he didn't just move in with his girlfriend, and the man said, Girlfriend?
[02:01:20.233 --> 02:01:22.073]  I'm a 30-year-old man living at home.
[02:01:22.133 --> 02:01:23.834]  Dude, there's no girlfriend.
[02:01:25.115 --> 02:01:30.497]  I just think... It's the first empty nest by eviction.
[02:01:30.657 --> 02:01:32.377]  We are men who still live at home.
[02:01:32.537 --> 02:01:32.798]  Yes!
[02:01:33.098 --> 02:01:36.259]  It's reminding many of a real-life failure to launch.
[02:01:36.599 --> 02:01:40.761]  The 2006 movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Bradley Cooper.
[02:01:41.081 --> 02:01:44.082]  This is gonna take a stick of dynamite to get me out of my parents' house.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.221]  Thirty-year-old Michael Rotundo says he has no money.
[02:01:48.641 --> 02:01:52.282]  He's actually a dad himself, but he lost custody and visitation rights.
[02:01:52.722 --> 02:01:57.344]  His parents say he's a freeloader who never offered to pay rent or do chores.
[02:01:57.684 --> 02:02:01.645]  He's apparently so thrifty, he filled his water bottle with the court's pitcher.
[02:02:01.865 --> 02:02:05.406]  Christina and Mark Rotundo served their son five official notices.
[02:02:05.766 --> 02:02:10.348]  Okay, he is in the building, ladies and gentlemen, and, you know, the lapis media is attacking this guy.
[02:02:12.096 --> 02:02:14.097]  But at the same time, the conservative media is.
[02:02:14.177 --> 02:02:16.438]  But wait, they're the ones that want us to be dependent.
[02:02:16.978 --> 02:02:21.400]  They're the ones in San Francisco and everywhere that say we should just absolutely pay for bums.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:25.961]  San Francisco's paid for thousands of homeless people to have sex changes.
[02:02:27.582 --> 02:02:27.962]  Look it up.
[02:02:28.862 --> 02:02:29.623]  So I don't want to hear it.
[02:02:30.523 --> 02:02:32.804]  I already got to pay for abortions for people in Travis County.
[02:02:33.044 --> 02:02:36.025]  Whether you're for abortion or against it, taxpayers shouldn't be paying for it.
[02:02:36.925 --> 02:02:38.226]  I got to pay for sex changes.
[02:02:39.369 --> 02:02:40.009]  I'm sick of it.
[02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:41.490]  Let me tell you something.
[02:02:41.530 --> 02:02:43.572]  You want to chop your junk off, that's your business.
[02:02:43.612 --> 02:02:44.192]  I'm a libertarian.
[02:02:44.552 --> 02:02:45.653]  Don't make me pay for it!
[02:02:45.693 --> 02:02:49.796]  Just like if you want a nose job, or you want a facelift, it's the same thing.
[02:02:49.916 --> 02:02:50.976]  I'm not paying for it.
[02:02:53.618 --> 02:02:54.218]  It's incredible.
[02:02:54.258 --> 02:03:03.724]  But the left will pay for sex changes of six-year-old kids in England, but they won't pay for a little four-year-old girl who has a leg that's four inches too short.
[02:03:05.285 --> 02:03:06.066]  It's a $5,000 surgery here in the U.S.
[02:03:06.086 --> 02:03:06.126]  to
[02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:11.992]  Go in and have the bone fused in, and when she's a little bit older, have to do another surgery.
[02:03:12.472 --> 02:03:14.914]  But they just told her, we're going to cut your leg off, Cupcake.
[02:03:15.474 --> 02:03:20.598]  See, it's all about the leftists and their weird, sick social engineering, having full control.
[02:03:21.258 --> 02:03:23.060]  Oh, we're not going to give you cataract surgery.
[02:03:23.740 --> 02:03:24.421]  Here's your cane.
[02:03:24.941 --> 02:03:32.887]  Oh, they got more doctors than anybody per capita in the world in places like Cuba and Venezuela, but there's no machines or medicine.
[02:03:33.608 --> 02:03:34.408]  Got a broken leg?
[02:03:34.528 --> 02:03:34.889]  Cane.
[02:03:35.389 --> 02:03:36.069]  Got a bad knee?
[02:03:36.129 --> 02:03:36.470]  Cane.
[02:03:36.870 --> 02:03:37.470]  Going blind?
[02:03:37.611 --> 02:03:37.911]  Cane.
[02:03:39.745 --> 02:03:41.822]  Stand up and speak out, they beat you over the head with a cane.
[02:03:44.602 --> 02:03:45.162]  That doesn't do it.
[02:03:45.182 --> 02:03:47.424]  They take you out in the fields, fire in squads, shoot you.
[02:03:47.804 --> 02:03:50.446]  And every little liberal trendy and Bernie Sanders loves it.
[02:04:15.643 --> 02:04:18.867]  You don't need all that.
[02:04:18.887 --> 02:04:20.068]  I just need an Audi A8.
[02:04:20.088 --> 02:04:20.548]  No big deal.
[02:04:20.568 --> 02:04:20.548]  $120,000.
[02:04:20.588 --> 02:04:23.151]  Venezuela is a really good place though.
[02:04:35.114 --> 02:04:39.456]  When we return, Mark Randazzo, one of the top free speech lawyers in the country.
[02:04:39.836 --> 02:04:40.656]  I've talked to my lawyer.
[02:04:40.696 --> 02:04:41.616]  He says, oh, that guy's awesome.
[02:04:41.636 --> 02:04:42.537]  We're going to get him on the team.
[02:04:42.897 --> 02:04:45.378]  If we're talking about doing that, his liberal friends might crucify him, though.
[02:04:45.798 --> 02:04:46.878]  There's so much going on.
[02:04:46.898 --> 02:04:48.799]  There's the new Sandy Hook lawsuits against me.
[02:04:49.679 --> 02:04:52.000]  We're going to get into all that.
[02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:57.042]  We're going to talk about all of it when we return in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:04:57.202 --> 02:05:02.664]  And then the countdown begins until we have the 30-year-old kid in here.
[02:05:03.624 --> 02:05:07.988]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:05:08.488 --> 02:05:17.396]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[02:05:17.936 --> 02:05:22.520]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:06:00.748 --> 02:06:07.573]  We've got it.
[02:06:07.713 --> 02:06:13.497]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:13.557 --> 02:06:15.679]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:23.624]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:35.634 --> 02:06:42.718]  Well, Mark Randazzo, one of the top free speech first-minute lawyers in the country, is popping into the next two segments with us at Randazzo.com.
[02:06:42.758 --> 02:06:51.883]  He's got Randazzo Legal and a whole bunch of states, including Connecticut, where we just got sued by more of the Sandy Hook parents and an FBI agent.
[02:06:52.503 --> 02:06:59.267]  And my lawyers, and I even had some other lawyers look at it, like Mr. Randazzo, looked at it and they said, this is the next level.
[02:07:00.618 --> 02:07:01.718]  of a frivolous lawsuit.
[02:07:02.499 --> 02:07:27.068]  I mean, they've got stuff out of context, it was in statute of limitations, so it's not even admissible, and it's not even accurate, and I don't even know who this FBI agent is, it's just a way to run this all through the media, but I wanted to get his take on that a little bit, but also on just the attacks on free speech in general, on conservatives, libertarians, online,
[02:07:28.174 --> 02:07:31.855]  And where he thinks that's going, and then I want to tie it into Morgan Freedman.
[02:07:33.295 --> 02:07:45.058]  You've got eight women, and then you've got eight other witnesses, or 16 total, I guess that is, eight other witnesses, that he would tell women, you're really hot, I want to go out with you, man, you're sexy.
[02:07:45.798 --> 02:07:49.038]  And the women on TV would go, oh, kind of giggle about it, and then he would stop.
[02:07:49.578 --> 02:07:50.499]  Is it a creepy old man?
[02:07:51.499 --> 02:07:51.719]  Yeah.
[02:07:53.039 --> 02:07:54.540]  I mean, he's acting like I acted when I was about 18.
[02:07:57.145 --> 02:08:06.347]  You know, that's how you, quite frankly in this world, I mean, if you want to get game as quickly as possible, you may have to run through a bunch of women, but you're going to run into the women that are ready to go.
[02:08:06.847 --> 02:08:22.570]  And James Caan, one of my favorite actors, from Rollerball, you name it, of course, great job in The Godfather, he was asked about Friedman, which is no comparison to Weinstein.
[02:08:24.804 --> 02:08:28.386]  Any thoughts on Morgan Freeman being accused of sexual misconduct?
[02:08:52.426 --> 02:08:56.290]  What do you think about him losing endorsements just over allegations already?
[02:08:56.571 --> 02:08:57.271]  What did you say?
[02:08:57.632 --> 02:09:01.396]  He's already losing endorsements over the allegations that just came out.
[02:09:01.816 --> 02:09:02.137]  I know.
[02:09:03.358 --> 02:09:04.980]  We're becoming a very strange place.
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:07.202]  Yeah, Morgan's a great guy, we all know.
[02:09:07.342 --> 02:09:13.048]  I think that's why God made men and women, so they could be attractive to each other.
[02:09:13.108 --> 02:09:13.369]  Thank you.
[02:09:14.744 --> 02:09:16.587]  Well, actually, there's an attack on men and women.
[02:09:16.607 --> 02:09:18.050]  There's an attack on regular biology.
[02:09:18.210 --> 02:09:23.119]  This is the deep state that's in the wedgie leagues trying to make us all fight with each other and smokescreen, in my view.
[02:09:24.454 --> 02:09:27.115]  The real sexual abuse going on by elites in this country.
[02:09:27.135 --> 02:09:30.176]  But that's another issue that ties into speech.
[02:09:30.476 --> 02:09:37.239]  My right to tell a woman, I think you're gorgeous, on the street, or at a ticket counter, or wherever.
[02:09:37.259 --> 02:09:38.500]  She says, buzz off, pal.
[02:09:38.780 --> 02:09:39.620]  And I don't buzz off.
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.121]  You know, then there can be an issue.
[02:09:42.121 --> 02:09:43.742]  But men don't even do that now.
[02:09:43.822 --> 02:09:46.243]  Men are like all this in the West and scared of women.
[02:09:46.663 --> 02:09:48.924]  Markham, it's another subject, but it does deal with speech.
[02:09:48.984 --> 02:09:51.865]  What's your take on that as we see Harvey Weinstein doing the perp walk?
[02:09:53.154 --> 02:10:00.919]  Look, you know, there certainly are legitimate sexual harassment and sexual abuse cases.
[02:10:01.579 --> 02:10:08.043]  And if somebody is an employer and has quid pro quo sexual harassment over an employee, that's wrong.
[02:10:08.583 --> 02:10:09.945]  Uh, you know, what Bill Cosby did?
[02:10:10.145 --> 02:10:10.685]  My God.
[02:10:10.705 --> 02:10:12.447]  I mean, I don't even, I don't even get it.
[02:10:12.467 --> 02:10:17.231]  I mean, a celebrity can walk into any bar and say, you know, say to five different women, do you want to go home with me?
[02:10:17.251 --> 02:10:19.333]  One of them is going to go home with him just because he's a celebrity.
[02:10:19.914 --> 02:10:20.875]  Drugging somebody?
[02:10:21.215 --> 02:10:22.596]  I hope the guy dies in prison.
[02:10:23.217 --> 02:10:27.861]  Uh, but you know, now it's, it's like this incremental movement.
[02:10:27.961 --> 02:10:29.002]  It can't ever be.
[02:10:29.443 --> 02:10:30.744]  We've stopped what's bad.
[02:10:31.576 --> 02:10:32.257]  And we're happy.
[02:10:32.798 --> 02:10:35.963]  Now it has to go to, even, the guy hits on a woman?
[02:10:36.524 --> 02:10:40.751]  I mean, come on, look, my advice to all men out there, play the numbers, you know?
[02:10:41.878 --> 02:10:45.040]  I mean, let her decide she doesn't want to sleep with you.
[02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:45.941]  Don't you decide it.
[02:10:46.381 --> 02:10:47.142]  Ask everybody.
[02:10:47.242 --> 02:10:47.722]  Why not?
[02:10:48.282 --> 02:10:49.503]  I don't see a problem with that.
[02:10:50.284 --> 02:10:56.988]  But, you know, there has to be this constant drumbeat to beat down any semblance of masculinity in our culture.
[02:10:57.889 --> 02:11:11.398]  You know, frankly, because, you know, I don't know why, but there's this mental illness that seems to be going through us as a society that we want to completely purge any gender differences and any kind of, you know,
[02:11:12.058 --> 02:11:15.699]  Man, it's like the Fun Patrol showing up in a Jeep every single time.
[02:11:15.799 --> 02:11:16.920]  Well, exactly.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:24.442]  Morgan Freeman's not accused of anything that I wouldn't be completely proud to do myself, at least from what I've seen in this segment so far.
[02:11:27.623 --> 02:11:28.083]  Absolutely.
[02:11:28.103 --> 02:11:29.764]  I mean, he's a little pushy.
[02:11:30.284 --> 02:11:32.765]  Some of it to me is creepy, but it's a free country.
[02:11:32.805 --> 02:11:33.545]  And the women, though,
[02:11:34.994 --> 02:11:35.375]  I don't know.
[02:11:45.069 --> 02:11:54.939]  Yeah, look, I wasn't there, but from what I've seen here, the only thing I've seen is that the guy was flirting with women, which I think is... Well, that's the allegation, too.
[02:11:54.979 --> 02:11:56.741]  They're just saying that he was aggressively flirting with them.
[02:11:57.042 --> 02:12:06.552]  And again, how is that as big a story as Weinstein, which if this is true, and I think there's so many people saying it, and a lot of evidence to it, then I think the guy should, you know, be sent to prison for life.
[02:12:08.170 --> 02:12:08.991]  Uh, yeah.
[02:12:09.031 --> 02:12:32.414]  I mean, again, just, you know, when, when men abuse their position, uh, when men, uh, use, uh, either abuse their position of authority or do something forceful or drug a woman, my God, I want to be the, you know, I'll be the first one out there with a pitchfork and a torch, but it's, it's this, you know, you've got this loud contingent of a very small group of people who really,
[02:12:33.058 --> 02:12:37.901]  You know, I think it comes from mental illness from women who just don't like their dads.
[02:12:38.481 --> 02:12:45.605]  They have this paradigm in their head that they think that every guy is somehow evil and they've got to beat this out of society.
[02:12:45.625 --> 02:12:48.847]  That there can be absolutely no masculinity at all.
[02:12:49.728 --> 02:12:55.295]  Um, and it's ultimately going to create, I think, a crisis, if it hasn't already.
[02:12:55.315 --> 02:12:57.497]  I mean, we got to be worried about this?
[02:12:58.018 --> 02:13:10.612]  Well, there's a thing also with liberal Democrat Party women, with other Republicans that I know, that they, at like these hotels downtown in Austin, so I'm married, I'm not involved in any of this, but I hear about it from people, the Democrat women
[02:13:12.014 --> 02:13:12.234]  Yeah.
[02:13:24.759 --> 02:13:29.284]  Say that all masculinity is bad, but in truth, they're really looking for somebody to treat them bad.
[02:13:29.605 --> 02:13:33.990]  And you've got 50 Shades of Grey and more and more women into all this bondage stuff.
[02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:37.634]  So, like you said, it really just sounds like insanity to me.
[02:13:38.175 --> 02:13:44.362]  And I think it distracts from real bad things that are happening to women, to conflate hitting on a girl with raping them.
[02:13:45.613 --> 02:13:52.776]  Yeah, I mean, look, that is the problem, that there is this argument that it's a continuum from flirting to rape.
[02:13:52.896 --> 02:13:56.978]  And no, rape and sexual assault is an act of violence.
[02:13:57.258 --> 02:14:01.560]  You know, flirting, hell, that's the first step in the reproductive process.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:02.741]  You know, are you interested?
[02:14:04.572 --> 02:14:12.276]  You know, as far as these women at the hotels that want to be mistreated, I don't know, and I think that's a dangerous way for guys to look at it.
[02:14:13.557 --> 02:14:16.958]  I mean, I can certainly say that I've bumped into that.
[02:14:17.839 --> 02:14:18.499]  Not my thing.
[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:27.084]  Not my thing either, but that's what I'm saying is, that's growing, and it's generally with women that claim they're liberal and hate all men.
[02:14:27.324 --> 02:14:32.587]  It's like well-known that interracial porn outsells 3-to-1, 4-to-1 in the Deep South to white males.
[02:14:34.269 --> 02:14:34.830]  I didn't know that.
[02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:37.655]  That's a statistic, but it's the same thing.
[02:14:40.359 --> 02:14:43.765]  Take women on women relationships and the amount of abuse that goes on there.
[02:14:44.006 --> 02:14:45.829]  These are real statistics they don't want to discuss.
[02:14:46.250 --> 02:14:47.091]  I don't know what they mean.
[02:14:49.368 --> 02:14:49.789]  I don't know.
[02:14:49.809 --> 02:14:51.009]  Well, I know what they mean.
[02:14:51.069 --> 02:14:55.592]  And that is that, look, it's everything is about power and domination.
[02:14:56.192 --> 02:14:56.873]  Everything.
[02:14:57.093 --> 02:15:07.259]  So imagine if you could walk into a room and everybody's supposed to play a certain game, but all you have to do is, you know, pull one card and you're automatically at a disadvantage.
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:15.144]  You know, this is a good way to target anyone and everyone who you might want to eliminate or climb on top of.
[02:15:15.645 --> 02:15:17.726]  It's it's the it's the victim Olympics.
[02:15:18.271 --> 02:15:20.433]  Let me ask you this before we go to break and come back with the First Amendment.
[02:15:21.474 --> 02:15:22.975]  When do you think we hit the bottom of this?
[02:15:23.075 --> 02:15:26.278]  When do we hit peak political correctness?
[02:15:27.339 --> 02:15:30.741]  One day, in the future, there will be the Uber victim.
[02:15:30.962 --> 02:15:34.204]  It will be one victim to rule over all of them.
[02:15:34.565 --> 02:15:42.211]  There will be a black lesbian in a wheelchair with an eyepatch and every single possible victimization and she will rule.
[02:15:44.133 --> 02:15:45.414]  So it ends with
[02:15:46.525 --> 02:15:47.805]  It's dystopian.
[02:15:47.825 --> 02:15:56.988]  Look, it's a dystopian fairy tale, but you know, it really is like this race to see who can be strong through victimization.
[02:15:57.148 --> 02:15:58.168]  That's right.
[02:15:58.308 --> 02:16:03.830]  It's a race to make everybody be weak and lazy and stupid so they can be controlled.
[02:16:10.476 --> 02:16:12.436]  What are you doing?
[02:16:12.537 --> 02:16:16.577]  What are you doing?
[02:16:39.273 --> 02:16:58.667]  Imagine a whole gang of thugs training with communist islamicists at a mosque, learn from one of their operatives that Tommy Robinson is at a McDonald's with his camera lady, and then they come over and attack the woman to get the camera, viciously start beating her, she fights back, he fights back, then they run as cowardly scum, and the police are all there and do nothing.
[02:16:58.987 --> 02:17:03.591]  All the way through this, I knew at certain points that with Lucy and with George as well, who are the camera team of us,
[02:17:04.680 --> 02:17:08.884]  I knew we'd get attacked at certain times, but I never thought they'd go for Lucy.
[02:17:09.564 --> 02:17:11.686]  I guess I thought too highly of them.
[02:17:12.406 --> 02:17:13.427]  I thought they had morals.
[02:17:13.748 --> 02:17:18.151]  So I always said, and as soon as they turned up and I saw the mask, I'm basically getting out of the car.
[02:17:18.531 --> 02:17:22.014]  I looked across, I see seven men coming towards me with masks.
[02:17:22.675 --> 02:17:25.037]  And then I stood and I tried to move away from Lucy.
[02:17:25.397 --> 02:17:26.458]  I thought they'd all go for me.
[02:17:27.128 --> 02:17:27.828]  So I thought, that's sound.
[02:17:27.909 --> 02:17:28.789]  I'll move away.
[02:17:28.809 --> 02:17:29.590]  They'll all come for me.
[02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.550]  They didn't.
[02:17:30.970 --> 02:17:31.891]  They sectioned off.
[02:17:32.071 --> 02:17:33.832]  One went to George and one went to Lucy.
[02:17:34.292 --> 02:17:36.434]  And then, as you can see, he starts attacking Lucy.
[02:17:36.454 --> 02:17:37.434]  He's resting on the floor there.
[02:17:37.794 --> 02:17:40.496]  But to be honest, Lucy gave as good as she got.
[02:17:41.016 --> 02:17:43.198]  Lucy gave as good as she got.
[02:17:43.218 --> 02:17:44.959]  And he ended up... She was kicking him and hitting him.
[02:17:45.239 --> 02:17:50.122]  And even at the end, I looked over and even see George, the other camera lad as well, scuffling with them as well.
[02:17:50.302 --> 02:17:52.303]  But they were masked up.
[02:17:52.583 --> 02:17:53.744]  They were ready to attack us.
[02:17:54.364 --> 02:17:55.565]  And as you're right,
[02:17:56.375 --> 02:17:58.219]  Straight after this, the police have turned up.
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:17:59.501]  They've done nothing.
[02:17:59.762 --> 02:18:01.866]  No one's even spoke about poor Lucy, really.
[02:18:02.186 --> 02:18:03.008]  No one spoke about her.
[02:18:03.595 --> 02:18:04.816]  I haven't seen one journalist.
[02:18:04.836 --> 02:18:05.997]  No one's contacted her.
[02:18:06.197 --> 02:18:07.599]  No media have contacted her.
[02:18:07.899 --> 02:18:10.101]  She's violently attacked for being a journalist.
[02:18:10.661 --> 02:18:11.622]  They're journalists.
[02:18:11.962 --> 02:18:17.647]  But yet, every single report from the mainstream media, Tommy Robinson fighting with masked men.
[02:18:18.148 --> 02:18:19.950]  No, that's not how it was.
[02:18:20.510 --> 02:18:26.315]  Tommy Robinson was getting a burger from McDonald's and his camera girl and his cameraman were violently attacked.
[02:18:26.495 --> 02:18:31.480]  Well, we've known it's this bad for some time now and me and my friends often say that
[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:41.345]  The day that Richard Spencer got punched was the day when the bar was set very, very low because we saw how many people celebrated it afterwards, how many people fetishized it.
[02:18:41.685 --> 02:18:44.306]  We saw the memes coming out saying, punch a Nazi.
[02:18:44.606 --> 02:18:46.007]  It's okay to punch a Nazi.
[02:18:46.567 --> 02:18:48.168]  And of course, you know, who's a Nazi?
[02:18:48.208 --> 02:18:49.229]  Well, we decide that.
[02:18:49.289 --> 02:18:52.010]  So we've realized that it's going to be violent for some time.
[02:18:52.651 --> 02:18:56.895]  The most shocking thing, actually, the most upsetting thing was how many people are saying it's fake or it's staged.
[02:18:56.995 --> 02:19:02.701]  People seem to think that Tommy has hired these people to come and attack us, which if he had, I think I might have to have a little word with him.
[02:19:03.582 --> 02:19:11.972]  But it's funny, quite a lot of people probably think, like to call themselves feminists and like to say that they stand up for women's rights, and yet here's a video of a woman on the floor.
[02:19:12.793 --> 02:19:17.499]  And, oh, it's fake, it's staged, or even better, I've seen some people say that I deserved it, which is very annoying.
[02:19:17.519 --> 02:19:25.370]  Some of my friends who are quite normal, who have normal parents, who think that everything's fine and the media don't lie, they saw that clip and it actually did make them realise how bad it is.
[02:19:25.450 --> 02:19:27.914]  So, in a way, you have to be able to show that.
[02:19:28.434 --> 02:19:33.816]  The extremes for people to wake up and realise actually, yes, this is what this is what's happening on the streets.
[02:19:33.856 --> 02:19:34.536]  This is what's happening.
[02:19:34.576 --> 02:19:38.238]  It's not being reported and it is being celebrated because I'm in this world.
[02:19:38.278 --> 02:19:39.198]  I know what to expect.
[02:19:39.218 --> 02:19:39.698]  We all do.
[02:19:39.758 --> 02:19:40.699]  We all know what happens.
[02:19:40.739 --> 02:19:42.599]  I've seen Tommy get in trouble before.
[02:19:42.719 --> 02:19:43.540]  It's just what happens.
[02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:50.182]  But I mean, there is a part of me that does feel sad when I realise that actually no, no single media outlet has got in touch with me.
[02:19:50.222 --> 02:19:52.303]  I've had maybe one friend get in touch with me.
[02:19:52.703 --> 02:19:54.724]  This is sort of something that's just going to get brushed under the
[02:19:54.804 --> 02:19:55.084]  You're right.
[02:19:55.144 --> 02:19:59.310]  I mean, this is classic authoritarian nightmare dystopia we're talking about.
[02:20:09.342 --> 02:20:11.945]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:28.897 --> 02:20:36.299]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:36.419 --> 02:20:39.980]  Okay, I got sidetracked over into the Harvey Weinstein situation.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:43.101]  And from what I've heard, people that know him, and he is a monstrous pig.
[02:20:43.681 --> 02:20:45.602]  I said that he reportedly raped women first.
[02:20:45.722 --> 02:20:46.862]  I was attacked by, um...
[02:20:48.615 --> 02:20:52.999]  Major publications on the left, like the Huffington Post, saying Jones made outrageous claims.
[02:20:53.219 --> 02:20:56.141]  He said there's a cult, too, where they brand women and torture them.
[02:20:56.362 --> 02:20:57.863]  Well, I didn't want to say the name and get sued.
[02:20:57.883 --> 02:21:01.606]  I knew about Nexium from people that had been on the periphery of it.
[02:21:01.626 --> 02:21:02.887]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:21:03.908 --> 02:21:04.349]  But yeah.
[02:21:05.009 --> 02:21:05.109]  It's
[02:21:36.491 --> 02:21:52.692]  You know when I look at a complaint like this and I see that it's got what 394 paragraphs you know that's not always an indication of something but it usually is in a case like this because it's relatively simple facts if we look at the facts
[02:21:53.223 --> 02:21:55.624]  They're saying you said something hurtful about them.
[02:21:55.684 --> 02:21:57.385]  You said something untrue about them.
[02:21:57.805 --> 02:22:01.947]  That shouldn't require 400 odd paragraphs to explain.
[02:22:02.507 --> 02:22:16.234]  And when I look at this complaint and I look at how that, you know, the logical contortions that some of it went through, and I'm going to take at this point, a judge, if you file a motion to dismiss, is going to take everything in this complaint as true.
[02:22:17.037 --> 02:22:18.858]  Just for the purpose of a motion to dismiss.
[02:22:19.438 --> 02:22:23.640]  Summary judgment or trial, that's later on when you evaluate the evidence.
[02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:29.482]  Let's look at this and just say every single thing in it is true from a factual perspective.
[02:22:30.222 --> 02:22:32.863]  It still seems like a pretty strange suit to me.
[02:22:33.563 --> 02:22:42.987]  It's trying to, you know, it's funny how when it accuses you of being a conspiracy theorist, but then it creates this
[02:22:43.809 --> 02:22:51.953]  It seems like an implausible conspiracy among you and these other people who happen to just be some of your viewers.
[02:22:52.693 --> 02:23:01.617]  So, you know, if you want to bring, just as a theme, when you write a complaint, you write legal documents, you've got to remember, you're talking to a human being.
[02:23:01.817 --> 02:23:05.559]  At the end of the day, a judge or the judge's clerks is going to read this.
[02:23:06.448 --> 02:23:15.893]  And if you create the theme of, here's a conspiracy theory against this person we're accusing of being a conspiracy theorist, I think you lose a little rhetorical ground.
[02:23:17.274 --> 02:23:23.177]  Another thing I'm looking at and that I find curious is they've added one defendant.
[02:23:23.577 --> 02:23:25.298]  So this case is filed in Connecticut.
[02:23:26.278 --> 02:23:30.921]  They've added one defendant who's in Connecticut.
[02:23:31.201 --> 02:23:33.842]  So we've got plaintiffs in Connecticut and defendants in Connecticut.
[02:23:34.002 --> 02:23:35.243]  And why that's important
[02:23:35.831 --> 02:23:38.112]  is when you have diversity of citizenship.
[02:23:38.792 --> 02:23:44.973]  So you have plaintiffs and defendants from different states, and they're seeking in excess of $75,000.
[02:23:45.494 --> 02:23:48.154]  You have the right to remove your case to federal court.
[02:23:48.894 --> 02:23:51.495]  That's something that's been enshrined in the law forever.
[02:23:52.155 --> 02:24:02.698]  Now, when you put somebody who's a nominal defendant on another side of the case, so that you have defendant and plaintiffs on in the same state, you lose that right.
[02:24:03.715 --> 02:24:10.260]  So, the concern here, I think, is that they really don't want this to get into federal court.
[02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:13.462]  And there's a number of reasons for that.
[02:24:13.622 --> 02:24:16.864]  Federal court is perceived to be more defendant-friendly.
[02:24:16.884 --> 02:24:19.206]  It's not to say that... Sure.
[02:24:19.246 --> 02:24:20.086]  I mean, let's just say it.
[02:24:20.326 --> 02:24:22.368]  They want it in local court.
[02:24:23.698 --> 02:24:23.978]  Sure.
[02:24:23.998 --> 02:24:24.118]  Yeah.
[02:24:24.178 --> 02:24:30.320]  I mean, Connecticut judges are appointed for eight years and then they can be reappointed.
[02:24:31.300 --> 02:24:40.402]  So if you have something that might be a politically challenging case, you probably would prefer it to be in state court.
[02:24:40.982 --> 02:24:45.803]  I'm not saying that the judge here isn't going to make a completely, you know, above board decision.
[02:24:46.404 --> 02:24:51.825]  But the reason that we put into the law this ability to remove to federal court
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:57.865]  Is because there was a perception that people might get hometowned by state court judges.
[02:24:58.445 --> 02:25:04.350]  Meanwhile, a federal judge, say what you want about lifetime tenure, there are problems with that.
[02:25:04.871 --> 02:25:10.616]  But one of the good things about lifetime tenure for a federal judge is they are completely insulated from politics.
[02:25:11.116 --> 02:25:13.759]  A federal judge can make whatever decision they want.
[02:25:13.899 --> 02:25:17.922]  Article 3 of the Constitution means the judge never has to say he's sorry.
[02:25:18.022 --> 02:25:19.644]  Sure, so in the time we have left, without
[02:25:19.984 --> 02:25:23.126]  You're giving away too much here about the defense here.
[02:25:23.146 --> 02:25:35.693]  I mean, I think the goal here is public relations to drag me through the mud, to bring the shooting back up for political purposes, not by the family, but by the Democrats and by the establishment doing this.
[02:25:35.733 --> 02:25:38.174]  And a lot of them admit that in the news, that that's their goal.
[02:25:38.214 --> 02:25:43.598]  And then to keep saying that I'm still saying when I never said the way they said I did those things.
[02:25:44.498 --> 02:25:45.459]  They misrepresent it.
[02:25:45.799 --> 02:25:49.361]  They reboot it and then create the trauma they say I created.
[02:25:50.802 --> 02:26:05.758]  themselves by always bringing it back up and then never saying all the apologies or all the clarifications over the years, they just reboot the crime against humanity they say I committed.
[02:26:07.082 --> 02:26:18.753]  Well, you know, there is there is something called the Streisand effect, which means that there's no better way to bring a spotlight to statements that you don't want to hear than to sue over it.
[02:26:18.914 --> 02:26:22.998]  So, yes, they've kicked the beach ball back up in the air here by suing.
[02:26:24.279 --> 02:26:27.322]  As far as what this is part and parcel of, I think
[02:26:28.331 --> 02:26:37.922]  You know, I think we've, when you look at this, you know, you do have allegations in the complaint of people who really have had their feelings hurt by one thing or another.
[02:26:38.923 --> 02:26:40.064]  You can't discount that.
[02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:43.528]  That doesn't mean that I think it's definitely actionable.
[02:26:44.108 --> 02:26:46.509]  You have some problems in this complaint.
[02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:50.731]  Look, a lot of these statements are outside the statute of limitations.
[02:26:51.572 --> 02:26:55.134]  The statute of limitations in Connecticut for defamation is two years.
[02:26:55.954 --> 02:26:57.275]  Three years for other torts.
[02:26:57.335 --> 02:26:58.215]  It's further than that.
[02:26:58.255 --> 02:26:59.816]  We've gone and pulled some of the statements up.
[02:27:00.376 --> 02:27:08.102]  Some of them are not even accurate in their little snippet, but then right after it, I'm playing devil's advocate and saying, but I don't believe that.
[02:27:08.502 --> 02:27:13.686]  So this is the next level saying you can't even question or talk about what other people are questioning.
[02:27:14.006 --> 02:27:15.788]  It's like this other lawsuit against me here in Texas.
[02:27:16.973 --> 02:27:19.175]  In a complaint like this, you know,
[02:27:45.037 --> 02:27:49.281]  I've seen, I don't know if it's next level, it's a very common thing, to be honest.
[02:27:50.302 --> 02:28:08.398]  Throughout my career, I've seen defamation cases like this where somebody has either motivation to shut somebody up, or simply looking for money, or actually feels genuinely wronged and is looking for the strongest legal theory possible.
[02:28:09.204 --> 02:28:13.728]  So in any event, it's always a plaintiff's attorney in a defamation case.
[02:28:14.489 --> 02:28:19.234]  It's always their desire to cherry pick out the worst of the worst.
[02:28:19.814 --> 02:28:27.041]  And then it's the defense attorney's job to say, hey, wait a minute, you've got to look at what came before and after these quotes and put it all in context.
[02:28:27.061 --> 02:28:28.182]  Here's the decision we have to make.
[02:28:28.222 --> 02:28:29.664]  Context always matters.
[02:28:29.924 --> 02:28:30.324]  Absolutely.
[02:28:30.364 --> 02:28:33.025]  We'll talk again in person on Tuesday here in studio.
[02:28:33.486 --> 02:28:34.186]  I'm Mark Randazzo.
[02:28:34.206 --> 02:28:35.266]  Thanks for spending time with us.
[02:28:35.326 --> 02:28:41.009]  In 20 seconds left, the big question is, do we launch anti-slapback provisions in Texas and Connecticut?
[02:28:41.369 --> 02:28:43.010]  And I think you and I talking, the answer is yes.
[02:28:43.970 --> 02:28:48.172]  I would never forego the opportunity to bring a well-placed anti-slap motion.
[02:28:48.412 --> 02:28:50.473]  And Connecticut has a good anti-slap law.
[02:28:50.713 --> 02:28:55.476]  So, you know, that is something that I think should be considered.
[02:28:56.316 --> 02:28:57.336]  I'm going to direct that on both.
[02:28:57.356 --> 02:28:57.917]  We'll talk soon.
[02:28:57.957 --> 02:28:58.197]  Thank you.
[02:28:58.957 --> 02:28:59.217]  Okay.
[02:28:59.518 --> 02:29:02.080]  We got a big guest coming in studio, that fellow that was 30.
[02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:04.882]  It's gonna get more Twilight Zone from here.
[02:29:11.107 --> 02:29:15.231]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[02:29:20.484 --> 02:29:30.028]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[02:29:30.128 --> 02:29:31.229]  It got ugly.
[02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:33.289]  Violence erupting at the event.
[02:29:33.409 --> 02:29:35.190]  A fight broke out.
[02:29:35.550 --> 02:29:39.832]  Fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[02:29:39.852 --> 02:29:43.894]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[02:29:44.114 --> 02:29:44.854]  You want to fight?
[02:29:44.874 --> 02:29:46.595]  You better believe you got it!
[02:29:51.548 --> 02:29:54.011]  You say he's not your president, then you shouldn't be here!
[02:29:54.111 --> 02:29:56.713]  Donald Trump is bringing us together!
[02:29:56.754 --> 02:29:57.695]  You got that?
[02:29:57.775 --> 02:29:59.356]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:30:07.205 --> 02:30:10.306]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:30:10.326 --> 02:30:10.807]  You're on the air.
[02:30:10.887 --> 02:30:12.027]  Thanks for holding.
[02:30:12.067 --> 02:30:12.888]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:30:13.108 --> 02:30:13.728]  Hey, brother.
[02:30:14.008 --> 02:30:14.388]  Good, man.
[02:30:14.408 --> 02:30:15.209]  Thank you for calling.
[02:30:15.309 --> 02:30:15.849]  Hey, hey.
[02:30:15.949 --> 02:30:20.351]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:30:20.571 --> 02:30:26.934]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:30:26.954 --> 02:30:28.775]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:30:28.855 --> 02:30:35.838]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:30:36.178 --> 02:30:37.299]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:30:37.339 --> 02:30:39.802]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:30:39.842 --> 02:30:41.364]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:30:41.744 --> 02:30:43.386]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:30:43.806 --> 02:30:44.547]  And exactly.
[02:30:44.567 --> 02:30:48.872]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:30:49.152 --> 02:30:49.432]  Boom!
[02:30:49.573 --> 02:30:52.416]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:30:52.456 --> 02:30:52.996]  It's amazing.
[02:30:53.056 --> 02:30:54.338]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:30:54.418 --> 02:30:57.421]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:31:04.358 --> 02:31:08.799]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:31:09.019 --> 02:31:13.740]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:31:14.320 --> 02:31:20.181]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[02:31:20.581 --> 02:31:33.183]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:31:33.943 --> 02:31:42.629]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law and Family Code.
[02:31:42.649 --> 02:31:44.551]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:31:44.871 --> 02:31:45.992]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:31:46.012 --> 02:31:47.313]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:31:47.493 --> 02:31:48.674]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:31:48.814 --> 02:31:50.354]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:31:50.875 --> 02:31:52.495]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:31:52.815 --> 02:31:54.296]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:31:54.636 --> 02:31:57.237]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:31:57.277 --> 02:31:58.137]  This is insane.
[02:31:58.557 --> 02:32:00.178]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:32:00.418 --> 02:32:02.978]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:32:03.419 --> 02:32:04.959]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:32:04.979 --> 02:32:06.800]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:08.680]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:32:09.541 --> 02:32:15.482]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:32:15.722 --> 02:32:17.063]  All just moderate dose.
[02:32:18.592 --> 02:32:26.578]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:32:26.618 --> 02:32:29.000]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:30.180]  But thank you for committing.
[02:32:34.247 --> 02:32:40.049]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it, but it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:32:40.069 --> 02:32:44.850]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:32:45.310 --> 02:32:54.572]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:32:54.913 --> 02:32:56.213]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:33:07.939 --> 02:33:10.742]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.326 --> 02:33:15.728]  We are drugged out!
[02:33:16.408 --> 02:33:18.671]  We are following other people's opinions!
[02:33:19.810 --> 02:33:22.072]  We are controlled by the media.
[02:33:22.612 --> 02:33:24.173]  Today, it all changes.
[02:33:24.473 --> 02:33:26.975]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[02:33:27.235 --> 02:33:30.117]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[02:33:30.297 --> 02:33:34.740]  Einstein says the death and event insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[02:33:35.060 --> 02:33:37.701]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[02:33:37.721 --> 02:33:40.223]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[02:33:40.563 --> 02:33:42.504]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:33:43.005 --> 02:33:44.446]  Why don't we just try love?
[02:33:44.626 --> 02:33:46.447]  We have the resources for
[02:33:48.547 --> 02:33:52.530]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:53.991]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[02:33:54.191 --> 02:33:55.752]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[02:33:55.792 --> 02:33:56.673]  They say Trump's crazy.
[02:33:56.873 --> 02:33:57.773]  They say I'm crazy.
[02:33:57.953 --> 02:34:00.155]  But I'm here to show love.
[02:34:00.335 --> 02:34:03.998]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[02:34:05.499 --> 02:34:09.041]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:34:09.621 --> 02:34:11.403]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:31.643 --> 02:34:35.006]  Michael Rotondo, thanks for coming in studio with us.
[02:34:35.086 --> 02:34:35.747]  Thanks for having me.
[02:34:35.927 --> 02:34:36.267]  You bet.
[02:34:36.447 --> 02:34:40.831]  You have been one of the biggest stories in the United States and in other parts of the world this week.
[02:34:41.091 --> 02:34:42.393]  Mm-hmm.
[02:34:43.093 --> 02:34:43.734]  It's exciting.
[02:34:43.854 --> 02:34:48.418]  It's not what I was... All I wanted was just to get
[02:34:49.515 --> 02:34:59.142]  What I asked for, what I believed justice to be, I didn't really want to have to have it turn into a media thing.
[02:34:59.562 --> 02:35:00.403]  But it's fine.
[02:35:00.743 --> 02:35:01.224]  I understand.
[02:35:01.264 --> 02:35:03.745]  But USA Today, there's the headline right there.
[02:35:03.765 --> 02:35:06.868]  30 year old man evicted by his parents.
[02:35:06.988 --> 02:35:08.809]  I'm not a crazy person.
[02:35:08.829 --> 02:35:10.971]  You know, I watch you speak at the court.
[02:35:11.011 --> 02:35:12.031]  I don't think you're crazy.
[02:35:12.171 --> 02:35:12.392]  Right.
[02:35:13.172 --> 02:35:15.013]  I think you're a little quirky.
[02:35:15.934 --> 02:35:24.702]  But everybody's a little quirky in ways, and it's easy to get you on here and be mean to you, and say, you know, that you're a 30-year-old bum.
[02:35:26.503 --> 02:35:35.311]  Because the real bums, the people that are on welfare and make the public pay for their abortions and for their sex changes, that's a level above it.
[02:35:35.551 --> 02:35:38.274]  Or, here in Travis County, where they
[02:35:39.713 --> 02:35:48.882]  Again, make the citizens pay for illegal aliens healthcare and abortions and things like that and illegal aliens out in California wanting free healthcare and anchor babies.
[02:35:49.222 --> 02:35:57.490]  And my whole issue is, we're told these are wonderful, perfect angels, but then the very same liberal media piled on, so did the conservative media,
[02:35:58.271 --> 02:36:16.177]  And called you a bum, and a joke, and a slob, and a delusional idiot, and all these things, which if that's true, that makes all of us even bigger morons to then at the same time, like 1984, hold it in our mind that all these other people are entitled to free stuff.
[02:36:18.077 --> 02:36:24.860]  I think that you shouldn't have people who need things like food and shelter in your own communities.
[02:36:24.920 --> 02:36:26.140]  I don't think it's something that you want.
[02:36:28.939 --> 02:36:30.180]  I'm just saying, just look at the red light, yeah.
[02:36:30.801 --> 02:36:31.302]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:36:31.322 --> 02:36:32.323]  Doing great.
[02:36:32.443 --> 02:36:34.044]  Yeah, I don't think it's a good thing to have.
[02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:48.620]  I don't think that even if it costs more, even if you have to raise taxes to get these people food and housing, I don't think it's something that you would wish to forgo because then you have hungry people and crime's going to go up.
[02:36:50.128 --> 02:36:51.449]  Isn't that going to contribute to crime, don't you think?
[02:36:51.649 --> 02:36:56.114]  That's one of the historically more reasonable arguments to that equation.
[02:36:56.514 --> 02:36:57.875]  So, you know, nobody wants that.
[02:36:57.915 --> 02:36:59.297]  Nobody wants crime.
[02:36:59.357 --> 02:37:11.728]  No one wants to have to use a firearm and then have themselves get attacked by the liberal media from that and then start the whole, you know, take the guns away type of argument, which is not the problem.
[02:37:12.449 --> 02:37:14.191]  And you're calling yourself a conservative.
[02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:19.842]  I have some very conservative views.
[02:37:19.982 --> 02:37:28.709]  I have a lot of very liberal views, but I think that the Founding Fathers had it right when they wrote the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:37:28.749 --> 02:37:38.336]  I think that if we were following it, I think that both of the ideals of conservatives and liberals could be accommodated.
[02:37:38.356 --> 02:37:39.837]  Well, Michael, here's the bottom line.
[02:37:40.157 --> 02:37:41.318]  I can't get on a high horse.
[02:37:42.665 --> 02:37:57.129]  And say you're the worst person when it comes to the whole welfare society out there, when on a scale of 1 to 10, you're about a 3 or a 4, because one of the most natural ways for people to turn into dependents and to go down this road you're on is with their parents.
[02:37:58.030 --> 02:37:59.930]  And in a lot of cultures, you know, that happens.
[02:37:59.950 --> 02:38:08.453]  Their families live in big houses together, but they all go out and work in the fields together or work in the factories, and it's more of a communal, you know, situation like the Waltons or something.
[02:38:11.144 --> 02:38:14.187]  On the other side of the equation though, what about your parents?
[02:38:15.488 --> 02:38:18.210]  If you don't have a job, what about them?
[02:38:18.270 --> 02:38:24.495]  They become your slave if they've got to pay for the food, the electricity, the house, the transportation.
[02:38:25.986 --> 02:38:27.468]  I would guess the medicine.
[02:38:27.488 --> 02:38:29.089]  I mean, what about them?
[02:38:29.209 --> 02:38:30.090]  What are you going to do?
[02:38:30.110 --> 02:38:31.391]  A, that's one question.
[02:38:31.711 --> 02:38:36.155]  B, what are you going to do when your parents can no longer pay for anything?
[02:38:36.175 --> 02:38:41.000]  What are you going to do when they have to go to the nursing home or God forbid, you know, have a stroke or heart attack or die?
[02:38:42.575 --> 02:38:59.871]  Um, I've been trying to leave the home, uh, for years, and it's as a result of that, that, um, I felt as though I would be able to in about three months from now, which was the, the case, well, the case I made was for six months, because that was what... So, so you agree it's a form of slavery to make them take care of you?
[02:39:00.852 --> 02:39:03.735]  To make, yeah, I don't want to make them take care of me.
[02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:06.192]  But they've been trying to get you out for six years.
[02:39:06.832 --> 02:39:06.992]  No.
[02:39:07.653 --> 02:39:08.334]  Where is that coming from?
[02:39:08.414 --> 02:39:09.094]  I saw that on the news.
[02:39:09.135 --> 02:39:09.655]  Is that not right?
[02:39:09.795 --> 02:39:10.336]  That's not right.
[02:39:11.217 --> 02:39:12.098]  Do you have that handy?
[02:39:13.079 --> 02:39:16.902]  On the news said that you lost your job eight years ago, six years ago, that they've been trying to get you out for years.
[02:39:16.922 --> 02:39:18.044]  Is that not true?
[02:39:18.324 --> 02:39:18.504]  No.
[02:39:18.644 --> 02:39:19.245]  First part's true.
[02:39:19.265 --> 02:39:19.785]  Second part's false.
[02:39:20.606 --> 02:39:29.209]  So, I've been there for eight years, but they've only tried to get me out since October of this past year.
[02:39:30.329 --> 02:39:36.351]  My first hearing of their decision for me to leave was the February 2nd notice.
[02:39:38.012 --> 02:39:53.695]  Well, I did think the media made this all one-dimensional to make fun of you and to laugh at you, and I also said some, you know, derogatory things that I've said to your face here, just being honest with you, because I want to have a man-to-man talk with you on-air and off-air.
[02:39:54.915 --> 02:39:58.036]  I'm tempted to offer you a job.
[02:39:58.416 --> 02:39:58.736]  Okay.
[02:39:59.176 --> 02:39:59.836]  As a reporter.
[02:40:00.497 --> 02:40:00.797]  Okay.
[02:40:00.837 --> 02:40:01.997]  And even get you a crew.
[02:40:02.938 --> 02:40:03.498]  Okay.
[02:40:03.718 --> 02:40:07.720]  In New York, but you'd have to actually go out and do the shoots and do the reports.
[02:40:07.740 --> 02:40:18.244]  You know, Howard Stern hired some interesting people and I think, you call yourself a conservative, I think we could, I'll just say it, we could turn you into a
[02:40:19.824 --> 02:40:20.625]  Formidable individual.
[02:40:20.645 --> 02:40:22.287]  But we're going to have to have some discussions.
[02:40:22.987 --> 02:40:23.308]  All right.
[02:40:23.708 --> 02:40:26.151]  Now that's New York City or New York State?
[02:40:26.451 --> 02:40:28.233]  But see, you may have to go where we want you to go.
[02:40:28.253 --> 02:40:30.435]  That's part of being... taking care of yourself.
[02:40:31.056 --> 02:40:34.079]  Well... Because you have to make compromises with your employers or other people.
[02:40:35.261 --> 02:40:36.322]  I just want to be able to see my son.
[02:40:36.342 --> 02:40:37.623]  I understand.
[02:40:38.104 --> 02:40:38.244]  Right.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:43.641]  So sure, that's how the discussion happens.
[02:40:43.681 --> 02:40:48.143]  But regardless, I've got a check here for you when we come back for coming down here.
[02:40:48.583 --> 02:40:51.224]  And I want to try to just explain a few things to you.
[02:40:51.244 --> 02:40:52.985]  You sound like a smart guy in certain aspects.
[02:40:53.905 --> 02:40:56.466]  It is slavery if your parents don't take care of you.
[02:40:58.787 --> 02:41:00.307]  Someday they won't be able to take care of you.
[02:41:02.628 --> 02:41:07.770]  You're going to be more empowered in your life if you go out through a daily process
[02:41:08.957 --> 02:41:10.878]  And go through trials and tribulations.
[02:41:10.898 --> 02:41:14.600]  You know, if they try to grow plants in zero gravity... If I'm managed, is what you're saying.
[02:41:15.441 --> 02:41:18.462]  Well, but I mean, plants don't grow well in zero gravity.
[02:41:19.122 --> 02:41:19.483]  That's right.
[02:41:20.303 --> 02:41:27.187]  You understand on a Mars mission, on a one-year Mars mission just to get there, you would have trouble walking even if you were in really great shape once you got there.
[02:41:27.927 --> 02:41:30.228]  I know, I would not characterize myself as a plant.
[02:41:31.529 --> 02:41:32.970]  But no, I'm explaining something to you.
[02:41:33.010 --> 02:41:33.210]  Alright.
[02:41:35.763 --> 02:41:40.166]  If you don't go out and work and live your life and go through stress, you don't become strong.
[02:41:40.466 --> 02:41:40.907]  That's right.
[02:41:40.947 --> 02:41:46.011]  Your brain falls apart and you become sedentary and have Alzheimer's-type effects by even age 30.
[02:41:46.211 --> 02:41:47.472]  Right, okay.
[02:41:48.112 --> 02:41:51.054]  And I've run into kids that play with phones and TVs all day.
[02:41:51.314 --> 02:41:52.855]  They have that same look in their eye that you do.
[02:41:53.176 --> 02:41:57.079]  There's an intelligence there, but you are in kind of a mesmerized trance state.
[02:41:57.339 --> 02:41:58.780]  You don't have a drive state going.
[02:41:59.620 --> 02:42:00.841]  My head's in the clouds is what you're saying?
[02:42:00.861 --> 02:42:01.622]  Your head's in the clouds.
[02:42:01.742 --> 02:42:01.962]  Okay.
[02:42:02.562 --> 02:42:04.404]  And you're smart, but you're not
[02:42:05.956 --> 02:42:07.437]  Not completely... Productive.
[02:42:07.537 --> 02:42:07.937]  Conscious.
[02:42:08.477 --> 02:42:08.797]  Okay.
[02:42:09.117 --> 02:42:10.398]  And it's beyond a laziness.
[02:42:10.698 --> 02:42:11.378]  It's a spirit.
[02:42:11.418 --> 02:42:11.999]  It's a program.
[02:42:12.419 --> 02:42:14.280]  How much TV and video games do you play and watch?
[02:42:16.061 --> 02:42:16.481]  Very little.
[02:42:16.741 --> 02:42:20.222]  I don't do any video games except I've been doing video games a long time ago.
[02:42:21.963 --> 02:42:27.626]  The television... I try to watch television because I need to stop.
[02:42:27.926 --> 02:42:31.007]  I need to have some time where I stop working so that I can sleep.
[02:42:31.207 --> 02:42:33.088]  I need to have some... When are you working?
[02:42:33.148 --> 02:42:34.689]  I work all day, every day almost.
[02:42:35.365 --> 02:42:35.665]  On what?
[02:42:36.245 --> 02:42:36.526]  Law.
[02:42:37.186 --> 02:42:38.746]  I have a business.
[02:42:38.766 --> 02:42:40.607]  You have a business?
[02:42:40.627 --> 02:42:41.227]  Yeah, I have a business.
[02:42:41.648 --> 02:42:43.128]  Well, then why don't you move out of your parents' house?
[02:42:44.008 --> 02:42:45.009]  I'm going to move out.
[02:42:46.009 --> 02:42:46.710]  I expect to be able to.
[02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:48.370]  Let me ask you a question when we come back.
[02:42:48.510 --> 02:42:48.750]  Alright.
[02:42:48.850 --> 02:42:50.671]  I got key questions for you when we come back.
[02:42:50.851 --> 02:42:51.932]  Okay.
[02:42:51.972 --> 02:42:53.452]  We're going to discuss this straight ahead.
[02:42:53.912 --> 02:42:57.174]  We have him here, the 30-year-old evicted, about to be evicted.
[02:42:57.194 --> 02:42:58.594]  I want to find out if he's actually left yet.
[02:42:59.055 --> 02:43:02.376]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:43:05.576 --> 02:43:14.460]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:43:14.980 --> 02:43:26.005]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:43:26.405 --> 02:43:32.086]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[02:44:05.942 --> 02:44:09.323]  Well, Brittany Pettibone has hundreds of millions of views on her YouTube.
[02:44:09.343 --> 02:44:10.404]  She's a great journalist.
[02:44:10.464 --> 02:44:13.665]  I'd call her a libertarian, nationalist, constitutionalist.
[02:44:14.285 --> 02:44:19.867]  But her and her boyfriend were trying to fly into London, where they've been many times, to interview Tommy Robinson, the great patriot.
[02:44:20.147 --> 02:44:25.589]  And they got detained for three days in a prison cell and told, watch your mouth while you're in there.
[02:44:25.989 --> 02:44:27.390]  And the media is all celebrating it.
[02:44:27.450 --> 02:44:30.951]  So investigative journalist Brittany Pettibone, define yourself
[02:44:31.471 --> 02:44:35.716]  Well, defining myself politically, I think the most appropriate term is what I've always gone with is an American nationalist.
[02:44:35.736 --> 02:44:37.018]  And, you know, I'm pro-Trump.
[02:44:50.143 --> 02:44:52.966]  And I've been interested in politics my entire life.
[02:44:53.106 --> 02:44:58.713]  I kind of got, by accident, politically active because of the presidential elections.
[02:44:59.033 --> 02:45:02.557]  But, you know, obviously they define us as all sorts of things.
[02:45:02.637 --> 02:45:04.679]  I don't even bother fighting back against it anymore.
[02:45:04.699 --> 02:45:05.900]  I mean, they called Trump Hitler, so...
[02:45:07.123 --> 02:45:08.425]  You just can't trust these people.
[02:45:08.945 --> 02:45:17.134]  But regarding what happened to us, it seemed like some kind of coordinated effort, because you saw they went after Lauren Southern right after my boyfriend and me.
[02:45:17.834 --> 02:45:23.600]  And it's one thing to hear about the lack of freedom of speech in the UK, but it's quite another to experience it.
[02:45:24.662 --> 02:45:27.726]  It's not only been eye-opening for us, but I think for many people.
[02:45:28.086 --> 02:45:31.810]  And I really hope that it will encourage people to speak out against this.
[02:45:31.890 --> 02:45:36.115]  I've gotten so many messages from people in the UK, like, I'm just embarrassed for my country.
[02:45:36.195 --> 02:45:36.796]  Embarrassed.
[02:45:37.196 --> 02:45:39.619]  Because, you know, Britain used to be so great.
[02:45:39.659 --> 02:45:41.742]  They're saying, well, not so much anymore.
[02:45:42.282 --> 02:45:59.887]  And you also have to question, you know, how much they put into shutting down people like myself, my boyfriend Martin Sellner, Lauren Southern, and then things like this Telford scandal that just broke, like the biggest child sex abuse scandal in the history of Britain over the past 40 years, up to like a thousand children abused.
[02:46:00.288 --> 02:46:05.309]  One girl, I believe she was about 15 years old, she was gotten pregnant six times over the course of four years.
[02:46:05.769 --> 02:46:11.011]  It's absolutely unacceptable, especially after Rotherham, how they can dare to allow this to happen again.
[02:46:11.371 --> 02:46:14.175]  So their priorities are just all out of whack right now.
[02:46:14.836 --> 02:46:16.959]  It's really infuriating.
[02:46:17.039 --> 02:46:23.708]  So if enough people in the Western world will just say, just get over their fear.
[02:46:23.788 --> 02:46:26.752]  Stop living in this mental prison.
[02:46:27.773 --> 02:46:30.034]  In, you know, basically having no ideological freedom.
[02:46:30.395 --> 02:46:34.697]  If they can find the courage to do this, I think then we will be okay.
[02:46:35.137 --> 02:46:39.899]  But it's just, like, even after what happened in the UK, I still don't believe the UK is lost.
[02:46:39.959 --> 02:46:46.383]  And it really perturbs me when people say that, you know, France is lost, the UK is lost, Sweden's lost, Germany's lost, whatever.
[02:46:47.003 --> 02:46:47.503]  Not yet.
[02:46:47.963 --> 02:46:48.944]  There's still a chance.
[02:46:49.184 --> 02:46:52.166]  So I think that it's going to come down just to the average people.
[02:46:53.066 --> 02:46:56.828]  And if they're not willing to do that in time, then
[02:46:57.898 --> 02:46:59.160]  You know, we just might be lost.
[02:47:08.554 --> 02:47:11.177]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.474 --> 02:47:30.638]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:47:31.358 --> 02:47:32.839]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:33.300 --> 02:47:37.944]  Michael Rotondo, one of the biggest stories in the country.
[02:47:37.964 --> 02:47:38.704]  30 year old.
[02:47:41.024 --> 02:47:45.768]  Taking his parents to court because they're trying to kick him out of the house and he wants more time.
[02:47:45.788 --> 02:47:49.751]  We're gonna find out if he's actually out now because I guess it was like two days ago the judge ruled this.
[02:47:49.771 --> 02:47:54.755]  He's here with us in Austin, Texas in studio and look this is how capitalism works my friend.
[02:47:55.596 --> 02:47:59.059]  I said I will pay you a thousand dollars just to come on.
[02:48:00.143 --> 02:48:05.406]  Just so you get a little bit of money and hopefully learn how to make your own money and go out and be free and have your own wife, your own life.
[02:48:05.426 --> 02:48:06.247]  I know you've been married before.
[02:48:06.267 --> 02:48:07.508]  I haven't been married before.
[02:48:07.848 --> 02:48:08.608]  Or have a child.
[02:48:08.909 --> 02:48:09.049]  Right.
[02:48:09.129 --> 02:48:14.992]  The point is, is that here's $3,000 my friend so that you can hopefully get on your own feet.
[02:48:15.272 --> 02:48:19.395]  I can and this means a lot to me and you're keeping me off the street with this.
[02:48:20.416 --> 02:48:20.796]  Well listen.
[02:48:20.836 --> 02:48:21.336]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:21.877 --> 02:48:22.797]  I can't sit here and
[02:48:25.069 --> 02:48:27.751]  You know, just put you down and call you names.
[02:48:27.771 --> 02:48:38.597]  And I've said a few smart mouth things, but again, what I'm getting at here is the globalists, the social engineers, they want to make us all dependent.
[02:48:38.657 --> 02:48:54.447]  They've set up a culture and a system that is trying to arrest our development and that is electronically programming our brains to put us into a type of artificial Asperger's type state, but not an Asperger's state where people are even able to carry out tasks.
[02:48:56.238 --> 02:49:01.382]  It's a spectrum and it's electromagnetic and it's mainstream news now that this is happening.
[02:49:01.842 --> 02:49:05.885]  And our embassy staff are getting hit with it at amped up rates.
[02:49:06.786 --> 02:49:12.631]  Cell phone radiation is causing heart problems, brain damage, doubling brain tumors just with the old 3 and 4G.
[02:49:13.771 --> 02:49:15.192]  And so what I'm telling you is
[02:49:16.113 --> 02:49:22.203]  I can't sit here and judge you wanting to be with your parents, having some type of, you know, psychological, you know, baby thing where you don't want to leave.
[02:49:22.343 --> 02:49:23.765]  I can't analyze the whole deal.
[02:49:24.065 --> 02:49:27.290]  But I'm telling you, this won't go well for you down the road.
[02:49:28.436 --> 02:49:35.437]  If you continue to not make yourself go out and live on your own and reach out.
[02:49:35.457 --> 02:49:47.179]  You know, just the idea of doing everything kind of OCD, you know, in exact little ways the way you want to get it done, and then people catering to that is going to put you into a smaller and smaller box, in my view.
[02:49:47.239 --> 02:49:48.860]  I'm not a psychiatrist or psychologist.
[02:49:49.140 --> 02:49:50.480]  I'm just a student on the street in life.
[02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:56.901]  So I wanted to actually humanize you, but also tell you I think your parents are doing the right thing, giving you a swift kick in the old ass.
[02:49:59.259 --> 02:50:01.260]  Uh, that would be, that would be reasonable.
[02:50:01.340 --> 02:50:09.541]  I think, um, I would say that maybe they should have served me a six-month notice to quit and, uh, then I'd be out in six months and they wouldn't have had to pay a penny in legal fees.
[02:50:10.082 --> 02:50:20.224]  And, uh, I'd be out just as you had, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[02:50:21.263 --> 02:50:23.765]  Professors and people saying, oh, you have a right to stay.
[02:50:24.325 --> 02:50:27.387]  Well, then do I have a right to just go knock on somebody's door and say they're going to take care of me?
[02:50:27.867 --> 02:50:29.649]  This idea, take care of me, take care of me.
[02:50:29.669 --> 02:50:33.491]  You know what happens at the park if you feed the squirrels and you feed the wildlife?
[02:50:33.511 --> 02:50:36.533]  They become obese, greedy, hateful and stupid.
[02:50:37.114 --> 02:50:38.014]  And that's what they say.
[02:50:38.034 --> 02:50:40.156]  They don't don't feed the animals at the park.
[02:50:40.876 --> 02:50:42.838]  Here's where that opinion may come from.
[02:50:43.339 --> 02:50:54.590]  The February 2nd notice was a threat to basically commit a crime according to the real property law of New York State, where you cannot all of a sudden lock someone out without a court proceeding.
[02:50:55.291 --> 02:50:59.936]  So that may be taken from that where it's believed that you go to the court,
[02:51:00.476 --> 02:51:16.899]  I would say what I said to the judge which is that you know this was this notice is against the law and they were threatening to commit a crime and it was harassment and the judge could respond to that by penalizing my parents and saying listen you know I'm... But they left you five notices and even offered cash to help you get your new home.
[02:51:17.771 --> 02:51:22.134]  Right, but that doesn't change the fact that it requires about six months to make it so you can support your child.
[02:51:22.194 --> 02:51:32.382]  Bottom line, do parents, when their child is I think biologically twice the age passed when they should be out of the house, do they keep arresting development more and more and more?
[02:51:33.022 --> 02:51:45.210]  I mean, you know, if you read Wagon Wheels, which is based on a true story, you know, it's like, former slave family, and they got their little 7, 8, 9 year olds marching 100 miles with a map that daddy drew to say, meet me there, and they made it there.
[02:51:45.491 --> 02:51:48.392]  I read stuff about my frontier families and stuff, it was the same kind of stuff.
[02:51:48.733 --> 02:51:55.517]  I mean, you have people skinning bucks, running trot lines, when they were 10 years old, and now look at us, they're saying the new 18 is 35.
[02:51:56.018 --> 02:52:00.541]  I'm sure you've seen those headlines, where there's this whole culture, Austin is filled with people like you.
[02:52:00.701 --> 02:52:00.941]  Really?
[02:52:01.181 --> 02:52:02.424]  Yeah, but they just live off welfare.
[02:52:02.464 --> 02:52:03.446]  They work one day a week.
[02:52:03.726 --> 02:52:04.628]  It's their religion.
[02:52:05.029 --> 02:52:09.939]  But then they think, I've got to pay more taxes so that they can, you know, sit around and smoke dope all day.
[02:52:11.431 --> 02:52:18.917]  Well, one thing I have to say in response to that is that I think that it's important that people, um, are trying to, you know, to grow themselves.
[02:52:19.117 --> 02:52:21.499]  And it sounds like these people you're describing are not trying to do that.
[02:52:22.159 --> 02:52:27.303]  And, uh, from that, there would be more opportunity because there'd be more businesses.
[02:52:27.443 --> 02:52:36.551]  So I, I, you know, and it talks about, speaks to what you were saying before about how people are sort of brought into this sedentary, uh, lifestyle, uh, where they just... Yeah, and I'm saying you're really common.
[02:52:36.591 --> 02:52:39.092]  You're not this, this... I'm not that.
[02:52:39.912 --> 02:52:44.953]  Well, I'm saying what we're discussing here is super garden variety.
[02:52:45.033 --> 02:52:45.793]  It's the trend.
[02:52:46.153 --> 02:52:46.393]  Okay.
[02:52:46.433 --> 02:52:47.454]  It's not the exception.
[02:52:47.574 --> 02:52:48.334]  It's the trend.
[02:52:48.474 --> 02:52:48.714]  Okay.
[02:52:48.754 --> 02:52:49.354]  It's growing.
[02:52:49.374 --> 02:52:52.115]  And most people that are like this act just like you.
[02:52:52.175 --> 02:52:53.355]  They're usually witty in ways.
[02:52:53.535 --> 02:52:53.975]  They're smart.
[02:52:53.995 --> 02:52:54.835]  They have little comebacks.
[02:52:55.035 --> 02:52:56.575]  They have all the little ways of doing things.
[02:52:56.835 --> 02:52:58.736]  And I think it's a gross form of selfishness.
[02:52:58.776 --> 02:52:59.696]  You're calling me a millennial.
[02:53:01.096 --> 02:53:01.917]  Well, you are.
[02:53:01.937 --> 02:53:02.537]  All right.
[02:53:03.797 --> 02:53:04.457]  I am a millennial.
[02:53:04.597 --> 02:53:05.237]  I will admit that.
[02:53:05.897 --> 02:53:08.758]  But what is it with millennials?
[02:53:10.097 --> 02:53:16.241]  I mean, I'm not bragging, bro, but when I was 11, I was... I'm not gonna even get into it all.
[02:53:16.722 --> 02:53:17.963]  The point is... I'll tell both ways.
[02:53:18.703 --> 02:53:23.827]  Well, by the time I was 12, I was, by all intents and purposes, had done the things men do.
[02:53:24.447 --> 02:53:24.687]  Okay?
[02:53:24.707 --> 02:53:34.034]  Been in a bunch of fights, already been with women, whole nine yards, looked like I was 16, when I was 16 looked like I was 20-something, I was 21 already on the radio, 22 syndicated, I'm 44 now.
[02:53:34.274 --> 02:53:35.435]  I'm not staying on that grade of a person.
[02:53:35.835 --> 02:53:38.817]  My dad was going in apprenticeships in factories and stuff when he was 10.
[02:53:41.249 --> 02:53:52.004]  His great uncle ran away from home when he was 11 and jumped on a steamboat and went to China and all around the world and came back and then was one of the biggest runners of liquor.
[02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:54.501]  In Houston.
[02:53:54.601 --> 02:53:55.361]  Would he have done that?
[02:53:55.381 --> 02:53:58.204]  Take Shane Steiner, my buddy's great-grandfather who died at like 102.
[02:53:59.064 --> 02:54:00.145]  Buck Steiner.
[02:54:00.205 --> 02:54:02.007]  He ran the Dixie Mafia in Texas.
[02:54:02.848 --> 02:54:05.570]  The whole nine yards by the time he was like 30 years old.
[02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:08.913]  But I'm just saying, man, how do people become like this?
[02:54:08.953 --> 02:54:11.135]  How do you not want to go out and do something?
[02:54:11.335 --> 02:54:15.318]  Your uncle hopped on the train and went off that way?
[02:54:15.418 --> 02:54:16.199]  No, my dad's great-uncle.
[02:54:16.219 --> 02:54:16.820]  Your dad's great-uncle.
[02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:18.221]  I'm saying they were all like that.
[02:54:19.157 --> 02:54:22.639]  They're like 11 years old in the middle of the countryside in East Texas.
[02:54:22.779 --> 02:54:23.279]  I'm gone.
[02:54:23.439 --> 02:54:24.620]  They were raised to be capable.
[02:54:25.180 --> 02:54:25.400]  Yeah.
[02:54:26.100 --> 02:54:26.821]  Not like today.
[02:54:27.901 --> 02:54:29.342]  Okay, so how were you raised?
[02:54:33.063 --> 02:54:36.125]  I wouldn't really characterize myself as having been raised necessarily.
[02:54:36.405 --> 02:54:40.927]  It was more or less I had to fend for myself in a lot of ways in that environment.
[02:54:41.327 --> 02:54:42.828]  Fend for yourself in your parents' house?
[02:54:43.048 --> 02:54:43.908]  Did your parents abuse you?
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:47.981]  I'm not responding to that right now.
[02:54:48.201 --> 02:54:52.224]  But I would say that I had to figure out things for myself.
[02:54:52.244 --> 02:54:55.727]  If I wanted to achieve something, I had to figure out how I was or was not going.
[02:54:55.747 --> 02:54:56.567]  Were you a latchkey kid?
[02:54:56.587 --> 02:54:57.808]  I don't know what that means.
[02:54:58.289 --> 02:55:00.410]  Did your parents leave you at home all day by yourself?
[02:55:01.931 --> 02:55:05.053]  I was on my own most of the day.
[02:55:05.073 --> 02:55:07.015]  Let me ask you this question real quick because we appreciate you being here.
[02:55:07.215 --> 02:55:07.435]  Sure.
[02:55:09.817 --> 02:55:12.299]  How are you doing right now?
[02:55:12.359 --> 02:55:13.559]  Are you still at home with your parents?
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:14.080]  Yeah.
[02:55:15.242 --> 02:55:15.863]  Tell us about that.
[02:55:17.544 --> 02:55:18.225]  It's weird.
[02:55:19.286 --> 02:55:22.288]  There was only two instances.
[02:55:22.328 --> 02:55:25.511]  It was basically normal, but people have been asking me questions, and I realize it's a little different.
[02:55:25.932 --> 02:55:31.116]  My father, the day of the judgment, came down.
[02:55:31.637 --> 02:55:32.197]  I was in the house.
[02:55:32.658 --> 02:55:41.366]  I was in the kitchen at the same time as they were, and my father and I tried to occupy the same space at the same time, and I said, excuse me, because I was just being, you know,
[02:55:42.219 --> 02:55:43.100]  Reasonable person, just you know.
[02:55:44.121 --> 02:55:45.502]  And he said, no Michael, we'll not excuse you.
[02:55:46.683 --> 02:55:48.024]  And I just, I didn't say anything.
[02:55:48.064 --> 02:55:51.106]  And I think to myself, what was he trying to achieve with that?
[02:55:51.126 --> 02:55:51.867]  What was that for?
[02:55:52.547 --> 02:55:57.151]  And from that, that was new.
[02:55:57.992 --> 02:56:02.496]  It was new for there to be a sort of a line in the sand all of a sudden.
[02:56:03.216 --> 02:56:05.478]  Wow, so your parents got a little cold with you.
[02:56:06.559 --> 02:56:08.901]  I would say provocative of a confrontation.
[02:56:10.367 --> 02:56:13.229]  Well, when you start getting old, you really want to do things the way you want to do them.
[02:56:13.309 --> 02:56:15.751]  And if I was 60-something years old, how old are your parents?
[02:56:15.772 --> 02:56:17.433]  60-something years old, 61.
[02:56:18.274 --> 02:56:22.177]  I mean, and I had a son going around that was dressed like Cousin It.
[02:56:22.917 --> 02:56:24.839]  I'd get pissed off and tell him, get the hell out of the house.
[02:56:28.782 --> 02:56:29.583]  I can't wait to get out of there.
[02:56:30.504 --> 02:56:31.665]  And by the way, I like your beard and hair.
[02:56:31.685 --> 02:56:32.886]  I was just doing a cheap shot there.
[02:56:32.926 --> 02:56:33.847]  The beard goes when I get my hair cut.
[02:56:33.867 --> 02:56:36.128]  I look like a pumpkin head, so it's alright.
[02:56:36.249 --> 02:56:36.649]  You look great.
[02:56:39.778 --> 02:56:41.901]  Anyways, my wife says I do, I don't think so.
[02:56:42.201 --> 02:56:43.483]  Hey, hey, but seriously, seriously.
[02:56:46.387 --> 02:56:47.449]  When are you going to get out now?
[02:56:48.610 --> 02:56:55.320]  I, um, I'm considering that I can have, well it depends on how many hands I have to help me because I've had some people offer to help me.
[02:56:56.244 --> 02:56:59.826]  Uh, but it's basically getting my stuff to, uh... Well, you just got $3,000.
[02:57:00.166 --> 02:57:06.930]  Yeah, I gotta get my things out of there, and put them in another place, and then, uh... But $3,000, you can't have that much stuff.
[02:57:06.950 --> 02:57:09.991]  We're talking, you know, $300, $400 a moving company?
[02:57:11.912 --> 02:57:12.332]  I'm not gonna do that.
[02:57:12.352 --> 02:57:12.993]  I'm gonna do it myself.
[02:57:13.013 --> 02:57:18.896]  I'm gonna save... I have until, uh... See, everyone isn't operating on your timetable, bro!
[02:57:19.296 --> 02:57:20.596]  I have until January 1st.
[02:57:20.616 --> 02:57:21.597]  You're telling me I gotta get out sooner?
[02:57:23.545 --> 02:57:24.165]  June, June 1st.
[02:57:25.066 --> 02:57:25.546]  June 1st?
[02:57:25.726 --> 02:57:25.906]  Yep.
[02:57:26.426 --> 02:57:28.886]  I'm gonna just try to put your email out or something.
[02:57:28.906 --> 02:57:29.887]  Maybe our listeners want to help you.
[02:57:29.907 --> 02:57:30.767]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:57:30.787 --> 02:57:32.167]  No, no, no, I mean to help you move your stuff.
[02:57:32.927 --> 02:57:33.368]  Don't put my email out.
[02:57:33.388 --> 02:57:35.148]  There might be a girl out there that thinks you're pretty handsome.
[02:57:35.748 --> 02:57:36.328]  That's not gonna help me.
[02:57:36.628 --> 02:57:39.389]  Don't you want it?
[02:57:39.409 --> 02:57:40.369]  One of those weightlifter ones?

[02:59:00.902 --> 02:59:01.682]  This is a human!
[02:59:01.842 --> 02:59:02.843]  This is what we look like!
[02:59:03.063 --> 02:59:04.183]  This is what we act like!
[02:59:04.743 --> 02:59:06.203]  This is what everybody was like before us!
[02:59:06.604 --> 02:59:07.424]  This is what I am!
[02:59:07.444 --> 02:59:08.404]  I'm a throwback!
[02:59:08.624 --> 02:59:09.124]  I'm here!
[02:59:09.464 --> 02:59:10.945]  I've got the fire of human liberty!
[02:59:11.125 --> 02:59:12.445]  I'm setting fires everywhere!
[02:59:12.465 --> 02:59:14.226]  And humans are turning on everywhere!

[02:59:18.007 --> 02:59:19.307]  Make no mistake, parasites!
[02:59:30.764 --> 02:59:31.252]  It's fun.
[02:59:54.744 --> 02:59:58.847]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.387 --> 03:00:00.728]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:06.772 --> 03:00:07.293]  News.
[03:00:07.873 --> 03:00:08.673]  Analysis.
[03:00:09.194 --> 03:00:09.874]  Reports.
[03:00:10.635 --> 03:00:12.736]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:15.839 --> 03:00:18.682]  Well, I think Michael Rotondo is eccentric.
[03:00:18.822 --> 03:00:23.526]  That was the old word they had for smart people that are quirky and a little weird.
[03:00:24.126 --> 03:00:33.375]  And of course, I've now been talking to him during the breaks, and he told me about his interest, and I have to tell you, my friends, it is Aschberger's type spectrum classic things.
[03:00:33.815 --> 03:00:40.600]  And you were telling me you like machines, you like numbers, you like engineering, you like just to watch machines for hours on YouTube every day.
[03:00:41.080 --> 03:00:41.721]  And that's fine.
[03:00:41.741 --> 03:00:43.622]  That's actually, I think, a form of advanced intelligence.
[03:00:43.902 --> 03:00:48.526]  But if people don't know how to shuttle you into the thing you need to be doing, then you'll just kind of spin your wheels forever.
[03:00:49.186 --> 03:00:51.108]  Because there are some people that are virtuosos with music.
[03:00:51.488 --> 03:00:53.309]  Some people are virtuosos with physical prowess.
[03:00:53.329 --> 03:00:55.551]  Some people are virtuosos when it comes to oratory.
[03:00:55.851 --> 03:00:57.873]  Some people are virtuosos when it comes to being psychic.
[03:00:58.629 --> 03:00:59.109]  You understand?
[03:00:59.169 --> 03:01:04.213]  But then there's other people that are just, their brains kind of get caught in the little technical minutiae of things.
[03:01:04.493 --> 03:01:05.133]  Which is fine.
[03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:06.234]  There's jobs for that.
[03:01:06.514 --> 03:01:07.475]  And there's fulfillment for that.
[03:01:08.536 --> 03:01:11.458]  You're saying I'm an employable person, is what you're saying.
[03:01:14.100 --> 03:01:16.461]  Well, repeat what you told me earlier, what you like to do.
[03:01:17.322 --> 03:01:19.804]  I like to go on YouTube, I like to watch machinery.
[03:01:19.824 --> 03:01:26.128]  I like to watch, excuse me, what I'm watching is I'm watching what the engineers have designed
[03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:32.801]  Uh, and engineered and built to be efficient and functional and productive.
[03:01:32.821 --> 03:01:39.403]  Like, like... Okay, then have you gone out and gotten, you know, the models and things and then built your own things or modified them?
[03:01:40.863 --> 03:01:41.703]  I've done some things like that.
[03:01:41.723 --> 03:01:49.825]  Okay, well, why don't you then go to, like, a radio, television, electronics, you know, type schools.
[03:01:49.845 --> 03:01:50.465]  They have those.
[03:01:50.485 --> 03:01:53.146]  A lot of those places actually can get you really good jobs.
[03:01:53.746 --> 03:01:54.706]  You'll meet a bunch of people like you.
[03:01:55.802 --> 03:01:57.964]  That's too monotonous.
[03:01:57.984 --> 03:01:58.724]  I like working with people.
[03:01:59.505 --> 03:02:00.966]  Well, no, there are going to be people involved.
[03:02:01.006 --> 03:02:03.929]  That's the whole point.
[03:02:06.331 --> 03:02:09.193]  I don't think I could do engineering in an office all day.
[03:02:10.054 --> 03:02:11.015]  I could do design.
[03:02:11.715 --> 03:02:15.718]  Hey, Pizzeria Chain offers a job to a 30-year-old New York man evicted by parents.
[03:02:16.559 --> 03:02:17.780]  Can you send me that link?
[03:02:17.800 --> 03:02:19.521]  Because I had someone refer me to that today.
[03:02:19.562 --> 03:02:21.803]  They haven't connected me to her.
[03:02:21.843 --> 03:02:24.746]  That's nice of them to offer you a job, but at the same time,
[03:02:27.651 --> 03:02:34.113]  You don't want a job as somebody doing technical work without the degree in engineering?
[03:02:38.555 --> 03:02:39.075]  Probably not.
[03:02:40.035 --> 03:02:40.436]  It depends.
[03:02:40.476 --> 03:02:44.217]  I mean, it depends what exactly the job description is.
[03:02:44.237 --> 03:02:46.057]  I mean, there's engineers, there's people who design.
[03:02:46.078 --> 03:02:46.998]  Do you have any friends?
[03:02:48.498 --> 03:02:48.718]  Sort of.
[03:02:49.399 --> 03:02:49.899]  Not close friends.
[03:02:49.919 --> 03:02:50.699]  I don't really have any close friends.
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:53.180]  You have to get out, though.
[03:02:54.571 --> 03:02:54.912]  Of the house.
[03:02:55.493 --> 03:02:57.717]  Just, you need to go out and get out of the house.
[03:02:57.797 --> 03:02:58.058]  Yes.
[03:02:58.519 --> 03:02:59.220]  I need to socialize.
[03:02:59.381 --> 03:02:59.621]  Yes.
[03:03:00.403 --> 03:03:01.364]  Your parents are trying.
[03:03:01.805 --> 03:03:03.428]  See, there's always been people like you.
[03:03:03.609 --> 03:03:04.230]  You're a good guy.
[03:03:04.430 --> 03:03:04.711]  Alright.
[03:03:04.992 --> 03:03:05.933]  There's all different types of people.
[03:03:06.860 --> 03:03:14.206]  The internet and computers are allowing people to plug into this virtual reality and every metric and every statistic says it's destroying people.
[03:03:14.667 --> 03:03:17.189]  Netflix is making the population growth rate go down.
[03:03:18.490 --> 03:03:20.212]  People aren't having sex because of Netflix.
[03:03:21.533 --> 03:03:22.594]  Humanity is dying.
[03:03:22.694 --> 03:03:23.855]  Our IQs are lowering.
[03:03:24.135 --> 03:03:25.296]  We're in a mesmerized state.
[03:03:25.316 --> 03:03:26.417]  You need to come out of it.
[03:03:26.477 --> 03:03:26.897]  Come on!
[03:03:28.779 --> 03:03:29.580]  Michael, you can do it!
[03:03:30.300 --> 03:03:30.481]  Come on!
[03:03:31.260 --> 03:03:31.740]  You can do it.
[03:03:32.561 --> 03:03:35.082]  You understand you don't have to be in this other place.
[03:03:35.342 --> 03:03:36.322]  You can be here now.
[03:03:37.102 --> 03:03:39.083]  There's an entire universe right there waiting for you.
[03:03:41.504 --> 03:03:44.045]  Have you ever run around in the mountains at night with a full moon?
[03:03:44.065 --> 03:03:46.746]  When it's about 30 degrees out with your shirt off?
[03:03:48.087 --> 03:03:49.868]  I've done some things like that.
[03:03:49.948 --> 03:03:50.648]  Stuff like that!
[03:03:50.708 --> 03:03:52.189]  That's how you wake up and recharge.
[03:03:52.509 --> 03:03:54.850]  You need to not just be hiding in your house.
[03:03:56.226 --> 03:03:58.187]  You've run around on mountaintops at night when there's a full moon.
[03:03:58.207 --> 03:03:58.688]  Was your shirt off?
[03:03:58.928 --> 03:04:00.249]  Was it 30 degrees?
[03:04:00.369 --> 03:04:01.129]  Not exactly that.
[03:04:01.209 --> 03:04:01.409]  Okay.
[03:04:02.330 --> 03:04:03.251]  That's what I do for entertainment.
[03:04:03.811 --> 03:04:07.273]  But the point is, is that you need to do things like that.
[03:04:08.414 --> 03:04:13.057]  I need to run around like a lunatic?
[03:04:13.097 --> 03:04:13.217]  Yes.
[03:04:13.237 --> 03:04:16.059]  I don't think that's going to help my case.
[03:04:17.800 --> 03:04:18.821]  But you know, it is Luna.
[03:04:18.861 --> 03:04:19.321]  Lunatic.
[03:04:19.621 --> 03:04:20.042]  Lunacy.
[03:04:20.582 --> 03:04:20.882]  Really?
[03:04:21.102 --> 03:04:23.124]  See, you've been programmed by the modern system.
[03:04:23.164 --> 03:04:24.464]  You need the real lunacy.
[03:04:26.371 --> 03:04:31.414]  I'm crazy, so I can't go nuts.
[03:04:31.474 --> 03:04:40.900]  You need to go, I'm serious, you need to break out of those little norms, those little areas, those little back eddies that you're in, and you need to come out of it.
[03:04:43.282 --> 03:04:44.022]  I think that's happening.
[03:04:44.783 --> 03:04:45.343]  I think it is.
[03:04:47.144 --> 03:04:48.405]  Ridiculous thought of me.
[03:04:52.165 --> 03:04:52.605]  Oh boy.
[03:04:52.786 --> 03:04:54.827]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.

[03:06:13.152 --> 03:06:18.098]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:06:18.158 --> 03:06:19.700]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.924 --> 03:06:28.885]  The old dude is facing an eviction threat from his own parents.
[03:06:29.145 --> 03:06:30.226]  That's just so ridiculous.
[03:06:30.706 --> 03:06:35.487]  Michael Rotundo's mom and dad are so fed up, they're suing to get him out of the house.
[03:06:35.988 --> 03:06:38.709]  I don't see why the judge wants to throw people out on the street.
[03:06:39.089 --> 03:06:45.811]  His parents filed the extraordinary lawsuit following months of repeated attempts to get him to leave their home in Syracuse, New York.
[03:06:46.231 --> 03:06:48.412]  And the story is getting lots of attention.
[03:06:48.712 --> 03:06:52.933]  A judge asked why he didn't just move in with his girlfriend, and the man said, girlfriend?
[03:06:53.033 --> 03:06:54.854]  I'm a 30-year-old man living at home.
[03:06:54.914 --> 03:06:56.595]  Dude, there's no girlfriend.
[03:06:57.735 --> 03:06:59.556]  Michael Rotondo is here.
[03:06:59.596 --> 03:07:01.376]  But you know, something happened to you.
[03:07:01.456 --> 03:07:03.817]  You went out years ago, I guess 2022.
[03:07:03.957 --> 03:07:06.058]  I've got the timeline here.
[03:07:06.718 --> 03:07:09.819]  You had a baby with a woman.
[03:07:09.839 --> 03:07:10.759]  It's your child.
[03:07:10.779 --> 03:07:11.420]  Boy or girl?
[03:07:11.680 --> 03:07:11.900]  Boy.
[03:07:13.200 --> 03:07:14.501]  And how old is your son?
[03:07:14.841 --> 03:07:15.101]  He's eight.
[03:07:16.274 --> 03:07:26.060]  Well, he needs you, and he needs you in case something happened to the mom or whatever, you know, to be self-sufficient, so that you can take care of him until he's 18.
[03:07:28.302 --> 03:07:31.624]  Well, I would actually support him until he found something that suited him.
[03:07:34.346 --> 03:07:36.747]  But what if something never suits you?
[03:07:37.348 --> 03:07:38.028]  That's a good question.
[03:07:38.068 --> 03:07:44.993]  I thought about that, and I thought that... You know, Donald Trump had some pretty wives before.
[03:07:46.444 --> 03:07:49.365]  Melania, though, is a whole other universe.
[03:07:50.145 --> 03:07:51.526]  But he hadn't run into Melania yet.
[03:07:51.566 --> 03:07:54.427]  Melania wasn't born yet when Trump got his first wife.
[03:07:56.587 --> 03:08:04.570]  So, see, you have to get while the getting's good, son.
[03:08:08.111 --> 03:08:08.531]  Okay.
[03:08:09.611 --> 03:08:10.771]  You're telling me to get... I gotta...
[03:08:12.722 --> 03:08:14.905]  Get some kind of commitment out of a woman now while I have a chance?
[03:08:14.965 --> 03:08:16.006]  Hey, look at Owen Schroer.
[03:08:16.026 --> 03:08:17.348]  Look at the smile on Schroer.
[03:08:17.388 --> 03:08:18.229]  Bring him up right now.
[03:08:18.249 --> 03:08:19.550]  Can we punch that up?
[03:08:20.331 --> 03:08:22.314]  Schroer, that's a guy afraid to get out and do anything.
[03:08:23.641 --> 03:08:28.566]  Oh, and I don't want to be mean to this guy, but the media acts like he's so rare and everybody looks down their nose at it.
[03:08:28.966 --> 03:08:32.049]  This guy is the future right here on the course we are.
[03:08:32.449 --> 03:08:34.471]  And I'm trying to give him money, trying to get him a job.
[03:08:35.152 --> 03:08:36.633]  I'm like, hey, you want to be a reporter for us?
[03:08:36.733 --> 03:08:37.394]  I'm serious.
[03:08:37.794 --> 03:08:41.618]  And if you just do some basic stuff and get better and better, you can be really successful with us.
[03:08:41.898 --> 03:08:43.239]  But you gotta go out and do it.
[03:08:44.821 --> 03:08:47.783]  It sounds like I could do a lot of good with...
[03:08:49.703 --> 03:08:51.884]  Do what must be done, Lord Vader.
[03:08:52.244 --> 03:08:53.425]  Show no mercy.
[03:08:54.926 --> 03:08:56.027]  I'm not a Star Wars fan.
[03:08:56.928 --> 03:08:58.229]  I'm not, but I'm a Palpatine fan.
[03:08:58.509 --> 03:08:58.589]  Oh.
[03:09:00.410 --> 03:09:01.991]  You didn't know Emperor Palpatine's my spirit animal?
[03:09:02.732 --> 03:09:02.972]  No.
[03:09:03.913 --> 03:09:05.474]  They overlooked that when they were mucking me up.
[03:09:05.534 --> 03:09:07.115]  Emperor Palpatine is my co-pilot.
[03:09:08.036 --> 03:09:08.276]  Okay.
[03:09:10.237 --> 03:09:10.798]  I don't know what that is.
[03:09:10.818 --> 03:09:11.818]  Emperor Palpatine's my boyfriend.
[03:09:12.739 --> 03:09:13.340]  I thought you had a wife.
[03:09:14.721 --> 03:09:15.681]  I said my spirit animal.
[03:09:15.701 --> 03:09:16.162]  It's a joke.
[03:09:16.302 --> 03:09:17.523]  Okay.
[03:09:18.646 --> 03:09:20.247]  It's a joke, Ian McDermott.
[03:09:20.607 --> 03:09:21.888]  Okay, the actor, he's hilarious.
[03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:25.331]  Emperor Palpatine is a comic genius.
[03:09:26.551 --> 03:09:27.032]  You know that.
[03:09:27.872 --> 03:09:30.034]  Owen Troyer, you want to say something to this great American?
[03:09:30.054 --> 03:09:31.755]  You've got your big veteran show coming up today.
[03:09:32.135 --> 03:09:38.780]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to that, and we're going to be talking about that here in just a minute in studio, but I actually had a couple questions for Michael.
[03:09:38.800 --> 03:09:42.162]  You know, we're about the same age, so I figured I could ask him a couple questions.
[03:09:42.362 --> 03:09:43.643]  How old are you, Owen?
[03:09:43.703 --> 03:09:43.843]  I'm 28.
[03:09:44.624 --> 03:09:45.865]  You've got your degree in psychology.
[03:09:45.905 --> 03:09:47.326]  You're a Jedi Sith Lord.
[03:09:48.206 --> 03:09:56.628]  I just want to know, because one of my, I mean, when I was younger, one of my biggest causes to want to get out of the house was so that, you know, I could have, like, a girl over.
[03:09:56.648 --> 03:10:00.549]  So I'm just curious, how do you, do you, do you even try to attempt to get women anymore?
[03:10:00.629 --> 03:10:01.349]  I was thrown out of the house!
[03:10:01.369 --> 03:10:02.809]  How do you bring women into the parents' house?
[03:10:03.189 --> 03:10:06.070]  I was thrown out of the house because my mom did not like this old girlfriend.
[03:10:06.450 --> 03:10:11.771]  And when that girlfriend, old Cindy, smart-mouthed my mom in the kitchen, my mom had me thrown out in two days.
[03:10:12.152 --> 03:10:13.692]  She said, David, get him out of here.
[03:10:14.677 --> 03:10:16.458]  So I can kind of thank her for being smart about my mom.
[03:10:16.518 --> 03:10:17.278]  I might still be there, huh?
[03:10:17.598 --> 03:10:18.118]  Sorry, sorry.
[03:10:18.258 --> 03:10:19.799]  Owen, ask your question again.
[03:10:19.839 --> 03:10:20.459]  I remember what it was.
[03:10:20.499 --> 03:10:21.559]  You can mess with me if you want, though.
[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:23.680]  No, so I'm just curious.
[03:10:23.740 --> 03:10:27.101]  I mean, do you even attempt to meet women anymore, or have you given up on that yet?
[03:10:27.121 --> 03:10:28.261]  Or do you bring women in the house?
[03:10:28.381 --> 03:10:28.621]  No.
[03:10:29.001 --> 03:10:29.862]  I don't bring anyone in the house.
[03:10:30.402 --> 03:10:30.562]  Okay.
[03:10:32.202 --> 03:10:35.724]  The time... I don't have time to fraternize with women, really.
[03:10:35.824 --> 03:10:36.624]  Okay, so, but you know what?
[03:10:36.644 --> 03:10:37.445]  You said that earlier.
[03:10:37.565 --> 03:10:40.646]  You also said that you are... Do you have a law degree?
[03:10:41.447 --> 03:10:41.627]  No.
[03:10:41.947 --> 03:10:42.267]  So what?
[03:10:42.307 --> 03:10:43.388]  You said you do legal work.
[03:10:43.408 --> 03:10:44.448]  So what legal work are you doing?
[03:10:44.528 --> 03:10:45.969]  Well, Owen, you've got a degree in psychology.
[03:10:45.989 --> 03:10:49.350]  Does this guy not act like he's got Asperger's with a helping of laziness?
[03:10:49.651 --> 03:10:51.872]  Well, I'm not a doctor, but... I understand, but you've got a...
[03:10:52.552 --> 03:10:53.893]  But I don't, I mean, I don't, I don't know.
[03:10:53.933 --> 03:10:55.753]  It's a nature versus a nurture argument.
[03:10:55.993 --> 03:10:57.714]  And it doesn't seem like it's the nurture.
[03:10:57.734 --> 03:11:00.535]  So maybe it's the vaccine or the food or something.
[03:11:00.575 --> 03:11:00.875]  I don't know.
[03:11:00.995 --> 03:11:05.797]  What if you had to, if you had to pick one, if you had to say Asperger's or no, what would you pick?
[03:11:05.817 --> 03:11:08.518]  Well, I think your Asperger's spectrum, undoubtedly, just by all of it.
[03:11:08.558 --> 03:11:13.559]  But then you've got the overlay of the, of the environment that is inducive towards the zombiosis.
[03:11:13.599 --> 03:11:14.940]  What if I'm just a regular guy?
[03:11:14.960 --> 03:11:16.700]  What if you're just a lazy bum?
[03:11:16.740 --> 03:11:17.621]  Maybe you are just a bum.
[03:11:19.041 --> 03:11:23.802]  A contrarian bum that will never get the perfect thing he really wants.
[03:11:23.882 --> 03:11:26.323]  I'm just trying to figure out, is it a comfort thing?
[03:11:26.823 --> 03:11:30.624]  If you really want me to answer that question, why do you want to live at home?
[03:11:30.764 --> 03:11:31.904]  What is the deal with that?
[03:11:31.964 --> 03:11:33.245]  Why don't you want to get out?
[03:11:33.705 --> 03:11:34.885]  I don't want to live at home.
[03:11:34.985 --> 03:11:37.526]  What I've told other reporters is that
[03:11:39.686 --> 03:11:43.687]  When I had my son, he was a baby and I had him three full days a week.
[03:11:43.727 --> 03:11:46.308]  Two full weekdays and one weekend day.
[03:11:46.748 --> 03:11:48.828]  And it was really hard for me to find full-time employment like that.
[03:11:48.848 --> 03:11:49.308]  Wait a second.
[03:11:49.329 --> 03:11:49.809]  Hold on a second.
[03:11:49.829 --> 03:11:50.449]  This is blowing my mind.
[03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:51.549]  You're a white male!
[03:11:52.089 --> 03:11:53.389]  You're an effing white male!
[03:11:53.449 --> 03:11:56.470]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[03:11:56.490 --> 03:11:56.710]  What?
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:04.441]  It's obviously an inside joke that you haven't heard yet.
[03:12:04.521 --> 03:12:06.962]  But apparently, you know, a white man has the white man privilege.
[03:12:06.982 --> 03:12:09.883]  So you're telling me you can't get a job so that you can move out of the house.
[03:12:09.903 --> 03:12:10.523]  That's what you're telling me.
[03:12:10.583 --> 03:12:11.223]  I didn't say that.
[03:12:11.243 --> 03:12:19.766]  I said that it wasn't really... I didn't have a lot of opportunities with all those days that I was, you know, being a father to my son, which was important and necessary.
[03:12:19.786 --> 03:12:21.086]  But do you have visiting rights right now?
[03:12:21.286 --> 03:12:21.426]  No.
[03:12:22.006 --> 03:12:23.227]  So what are you so busy with then?
[03:12:23.247 --> 03:12:24.227]  I'm still trying to figure this out.
[03:12:24.327 --> 03:12:25.287]  Trying to get to see him again.
[03:12:25.307 --> 03:12:27.868]  That's what I've been doing for a long time.
[03:12:27.908 --> 03:12:30.149]  So you're battling with the courts and with lawyers right now?
[03:12:31.052 --> 03:12:31.633]  Just the courts.
[03:12:32.053 --> 03:12:32.694]  Oh, yeah, and lawyers.
[03:12:32.734 --> 03:12:33.295]  Yeah, courts and lawyers.
[03:12:33.315 --> 03:12:33.775]  You're exactly right.
[03:12:33.795 --> 03:12:40.003]  Okay, don't you think it might be advantageous for you to maybe, like, get some money behind this effort and maybe hire a lawyer?
[03:12:40.023 --> 03:12:43.488]  It's not going to change the merit of my contentions.
[03:12:44.688 --> 03:12:46.229]  Yeah, but it might help you, don't you think?
[03:12:46.249 --> 03:12:47.749]  I mean, this is a court of law.
[03:12:48.069 --> 03:12:48.769]  How would that help?
[03:12:49.370 --> 03:12:51.110]  Just by saying the magic words?
[03:12:51.931 --> 03:12:55.572]  I mean, dude, if you don't know how the judicial system works, I mean, clearly you don't.
[03:12:55.612 --> 03:12:56.352]  How does the judicial system work?
[03:12:56.372 --> 03:12:56.892]  Well, let me tell you.
[03:12:56.912 --> 03:12:59.413]  My ex-wife took the kids and filed them.
[03:12:59.453 --> 03:13:06.076]  I'd only have them four hours on the weekend and I went and got lawyers and went and had a big court battle and, you know, got my kids half the time.
[03:13:06.336 --> 03:13:07.996]  Have you ever been on your own, Michael?
[03:13:08.036 --> 03:13:09.257]  Have you ever been out of the parents' house?
[03:13:09.377 --> 03:13:09.597]  I have.
[03:13:10.307 --> 03:13:11.247]  And what was that like for you?
[03:13:11.607 --> 03:13:12.367]  Did you not like it?
[03:13:12.487 --> 03:13:13.188]  No, I loved it.
[03:13:13.208 --> 03:13:15.708]  It was great.
[03:13:16.088 --> 03:13:17.188]  You're very busy all the time.
[03:13:17.208 --> 03:13:18.909]  You gotta work.
[03:13:19.369 --> 03:13:28.951]  I think you should take up something like kickboxing or something athletic.
[03:13:29.251 --> 03:13:30.851]  Are you engaged in any athletic pursuits?
[03:13:31.731 --> 03:13:32.652]  I like to bicycle.
[03:13:32.672 --> 03:13:35.252]  I like to ride my bicycle.
[03:13:35.272 --> 03:13:36.352]  Another Bernie Sanders favorite?
[03:13:36.993 --> 03:13:37.273]  Is it?
[03:13:38.393 --> 03:13:38.753]  Is he around?
[03:13:40.208 --> 03:13:49.455]  How would you like, how would you like to be Bernie Sanders' assistant?
[03:13:51.536 --> 03:13:53.298]  Probably wouldn't like to assist someone else.
[03:13:54.038 --> 03:13:59.402]  Ah, I just figured because he wants to take care of everybody that's poor and that needs help, so I think he should give you a job.
[03:14:01.463 --> 03:14:04.806]  But you're not going to have any leftists actually offer anybody jobs, that's conservatives that do that.
[03:14:09.824 --> 03:14:10.564]  Were you breastfed?
[03:14:13.225 --> 03:14:13.865]  I don't remember.
[03:14:13.885 --> 03:14:22.607]  That's actually very important because the fatty acids in natural breast milk give you, your brain, a lot more power to develop than the formula.
[03:14:23.667 --> 03:14:28.148]  The brain will actually weigh 10-15% less, have a lot less neuron density.
[03:14:28.328 --> 03:14:30.829]  So wait, let me ask Michael, how old is your child?
[03:14:30.849 --> 03:14:30.969]  Eight.
[03:14:32.669 --> 03:14:32.829]  Eight?
[03:14:33.009 --> 03:14:34.531]  So you had that child at age 22?
[03:14:34.591 --> 03:14:35.932]  That's right.
[03:14:36.252 --> 03:14:38.935]  And so for eight years you've been fighting for custody?
[03:14:39.035 --> 03:14:39.815]  I mean, how does this go?
[03:14:40.056 --> 03:14:44.139]  Well, uh, when he was a baby, I really, I really, it wasn't feasible for me to work full-time.
[03:14:44.419 --> 03:14:48.643]  Um, after he started going to school... Seems like it's never feasible, feasible for you to work full-time.
[03:14:48.663 --> 03:14:50.805]  You know, I don't think anybody would like to work full-time.
[03:14:50.825 --> 03:14:54.308]  You know, everybody would like to just retire or live in someone's house.
[03:14:54.388 --> 03:14:55.329]  But I mean, you know... Not me!
[03:14:55.469 --> 03:14:56.991]  I want to, I want to work 24 hours a day.
[03:14:59.013 --> 03:15:00.454]  I had lost my job prior to that.
[03:15:00.474 --> 03:15:01.255]  I was fired.
[03:15:01.275 --> 03:15:02.857]  I was a little frustrated with employment.
[03:15:03.037 --> 03:15:13.509]  But after I had my son, after I was a father for a little while, I found that I had the gift that public schools offer us, which is the time to work with our kids.
[03:15:14.918 --> 03:15:15.879]  I don't know.
[03:15:30.250 --> 03:15:37.776]  There are a lot of folks that can't get out of their parents' basement because the economy is so bad in their area, and the family decides to live together so they can have extra money, and that's kind of a smart thing.
[03:15:38.137 --> 03:15:46.144]  If the family decides to live together in a post-industrial economy, I don't put people down that live with their parents if the family works together or a lot of folks take care of their parents.
[03:15:46.724 --> 03:15:52.910]  I'm putting down the fact that you, like so many other millennials and trendies, don't have any
[03:15:54.432 --> 03:15:57.774]  Aspirations for life in the world, except politically running my life.
[03:15:58.174 --> 03:16:01.976]  You don't have the whole liberal control freak contingent though, so you're a little bit different.
[03:16:02.697 --> 03:16:06.659]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[03:16:06.719 --> 03:16:14.183]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[03:16:14.244 --> 03:16:20.027]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[03:16:23.496 --> 03:16:26.618]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[03:16:27.479 --> 03:16:28.239]  But he didn't give up.
[03:16:29.520 --> 03:16:30.001]  And he won.
[03:16:30.781 --> 03:16:33.123]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[03:16:33.883 --> 03:16:37.966]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall to get a victory.
[03:16:39.227 --> 03:16:42.470]  The Alamo stood and fought Victor or Death Colonel Travis.
[03:16:43.570 --> 03:16:44.451]  And they all died.
[03:16:44.711 --> 03:16:46.032]  All 180 plus men.
[03:16:47.913 --> 03:16:51.396]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[03:16:53.038 --> 03:16:57.260]  So I don't know how the Infowars fight is gonna end.
[03:16:58.521 --> 03:16:59.101]  But I know this.
[03:17:01.622 --> 03:17:21.893]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[03:17:23.393 --> 03:17:27.097]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[03:17:28.018 --> 03:17:35.565]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[03:17:37.968 --> 03:17:47.417]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[03:17:49.844 --> 03:17:53.187]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[03:17:54.208 --> 03:17:56.329]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[03:17:56.730 --> 03:17:58.952]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[03:18:00.273 --> 03:18:00.473]  PQQ.
[03:18:00.493 --> 03:18:00.693]  Go Q10.
[03:18:02.944 --> 03:18:10.629]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[03:18:11.049 --> 03:18:23.678]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:18:24.770 --> 03:18:25.190]  Think about that.
[03:18:25.831 --> 03:18:27.172]  It's $74 right now.
[03:18:28.132 --> 03:18:33.115]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[03:18:34.096 --> 03:18:35.397]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[03:18:35.437 --> 03:18:43.782]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[03:18:44.122 --> 03:18:45.844]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[03:18:46.844 --> 03:18:52.647]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product.
[03:18:52.667 --> 03:18:53.868]  So I'm not gambled.
[03:18:54.448 --> 03:18:55.308]  I know you want value.
[03:18:55.348 --> 03:18:57.049]  So we've bought even more of it.
[03:18:57.950 --> 03:19:00.051]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it.
[03:19:00.611 --> 03:19:07.134]  And we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:19:07.795 --> 03:19:08.495]  DNA Force.
[03:19:08.595 --> 03:19:09.956]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[03:19:10.096 --> 03:19:10.636]  Thousands of them.
[03:19:10.896 --> 03:19:12.357]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[03:19:12.797 --> 03:19:13.738]  It is dramatic.
[03:19:14.955 --> 03:19:22.742]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[03:19:23.463 --> 03:19:31.990]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:39.076]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[03:19:41.957 --> 03:19:47.559]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[03:19:47.759 --> 03:19:48.219]  That's fine.
[03:19:49.659 --> 03:19:50.720]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[03:19:51.140 --> 03:19:51.820]  I'm funded by you.
[03:19:52.060 --> 03:19:52.940]  So thank you all.
[03:19:53.601 --> 03:19:58.602]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[03:19:59.142 --> 03:20:01.843]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[03:20:08.045 --> 03:20:10.686]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.439 --> 03:20:13.520]  Yeah.
[03:20:41.898 --> 03:20:43.358]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:20:43.418 --> 03:20:49.740]  I'm Alex Jones and Michael Rotondo, the 30-year-old who refused to move out of his parents' house, had to take him to court.
[03:20:49.820 --> 03:20:51.281]  The judge said, yeah, you got to get out.
[03:20:52.361 --> 03:20:55.642]  Liberal media, conservative media made fun of him and said, what a bum, what a horrible person.
[03:20:56.962 --> 03:21:00.443]  I was talking to Owen Schroeder during the break and I said, what is your prognosis?
[03:21:00.863 --> 03:21:01.584]  You're a smart guy.
[03:21:01.604 --> 03:21:07.025]  And I talked to some of the other folks in there and they pretty much all came up with the same conclusion that I have in my heart.
[03:21:07.105 --> 03:21:07.765]  I think it's this.
[03:21:08.286 --> 03:21:09.586]  Owen, give us your take.
[03:21:10.660 --> 03:21:14.183]  Well, I think that you've just never had anybody really empower you.
[03:21:14.343 --> 03:21:23.651]  You've never felt that anyone has had faith in you or trust in you, so you've never felt the inclination to make more of yourself because you don't feel like anyone's ever believed in you.
[03:21:24.212 --> 03:21:36.403]  And when I saw that moment when Alex handed you the check but also talked about maybe hiring you, there was an emotion that I think came over you and I saw it in your face that it felt like for the first time somebody was willing to invest in you
[03:21:37.103 --> 03:21:42.666]  And that was empowering for you, to have that feeling that somebody is willing to stick their neck out there for you and invest in you.
[03:21:43.026 --> 03:21:45.208]  And I think for a lot of people, that's all it takes sometimes.
[03:21:45.228 --> 03:21:49.810]  It's just that little push of somebody having faith in you and investing in you that gets you going.
[03:21:49.830 --> 03:21:55.333]  And by the way, the globalists believe everybody's already done, so they're trying to dumb people down to control them, to then depopulate.
[03:21:55.393 --> 03:21:58.155]  And that's what this whole anti-man, anti-woman agenda is.
[03:21:58.675 --> 03:22:02.138]  They admit in the WikiLeaks and the government documents the whole gay agenda is about that.
[03:22:02.178 --> 03:22:03.199]  I'm not bashing gay people.
[03:22:03.399 --> 03:22:04.139]  That's always happened.
[03:22:04.159 --> 03:22:05.020]  That's always been there.
[03:22:05.260 --> 03:22:08.423]  But the artificiality pushing it is about depopulation.
[03:22:08.783 --> 03:22:15.368]  And so people are going into these Asperger's type things that are artificial from the programming, from the television, from the Internet.
[03:22:15.809 --> 03:22:17.530]  And we're hypocrites.
[03:22:17.590 --> 03:22:18.551]  We're on this thing, too.
[03:22:19.011 --> 03:22:20.112]  That's how we're reaching people.
[03:22:20.152 --> 03:22:22.955]  But I'm telling you, I see this in more and more young people.
[03:22:23.914 --> 03:22:30.518]  I know you are 30, but I'm seeing this in a lot of males, especially, who don't thrive in the outside world.
[03:22:30.558 --> 03:22:34.461]  People don't, you know, have barbecues or, you know, outside at night.
[03:22:34.521 --> 03:22:37.082]  Like when I was a kid, people were still outside most of the time.
[03:22:37.363 --> 03:22:38.924]  Maybe we watch a Saturday night movie or...
[03:22:39.804 --> 03:22:42.966]  Well, I'll just say this and if there's anybody else that wants to talk to Michael here.
[03:23:08.320 --> 03:23:09.080]  I think you're right, Alex.
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:15.782]  I think this is a common issue and it's different than the government just saying, oh, you know, here's a check or welfare or a hand up or everything.
[03:23:16.002 --> 03:23:17.223]  That doesn't really empower you.
[03:23:17.243 --> 03:23:18.363]  That doesn't really influence you.
[03:23:18.403 --> 03:23:20.304]  That makes you want to get more comfortable.
[03:23:20.624 --> 03:23:27.966]  Whereas if somebody, if a person invests in you, now you're answering to them and there's a, there's a, there's an actual human experience there.
[03:23:27.986 --> 03:23:30.747]  There's a bonding experience there that can make a man a man.
[03:23:31.207 --> 03:23:32.947]  So I think that that's the big difference here.
[03:23:33.208 --> 03:23:36.008]  And, um, I think that this is just something that a lot of people lack.
[03:23:36.028 --> 03:23:36.909]  They don't have leadership.
[03:23:36.949 --> 03:23:37.629]  They don't, whether it's,
[03:23:38.290 --> 03:23:42.117]  In a family or in school or whatever it is, they just don't have somebody that's willing to invest in them.
[03:23:42.738 --> 03:23:45.864]  And I'll just say this in closing, you know, I don't know, I don't know what...
[03:23:47.290 --> 03:24:00.298]  I'll just say this, Michael, I don't know what you think the best options are right now for you to get your kid back, but I would say your best option is to work your tail off and get a great job, and yeah, make some money, get your own home, and then the judge will whip you better.
[03:24:00.318 --> 03:24:05.922]  We're going to keep it in here for one episode, one more segment when Saw Man comes on with you, when we're plugging your big veteran special.
[03:24:06.242 --> 03:24:13.687]  It's coming up today on The War Room, and Saw Man, former Navy SEAL patriot, his buddy just got the Congressional Medal of Honor yesterday, pretty big deal.
[03:24:14.487 --> 03:24:16.169]  We're going to be breaking all that down.
[03:24:16.209 --> 03:24:18.270]  I'm headed into Memorial Day, but great points, Owen.
[03:24:18.771 --> 03:24:20.352]  And again, jump at any time, Michael.
[03:24:20.852 --> 03:24:25.836]  Again, the man that's 30 years old, being evicted from his parents' house in court this week, if you just tuned in.
[03:24:25.856 --> 03:24:32.181]  And let's bring in Daria, or let's bring in Jake Lloyd, or let's bring in any of the other folks that want to get on there.
[03:24:32.281 --> 03:24:33.321]  Well, I want to answer his question.
[03:24:34.202 --> 03:24:41.085]  What he said was, you know, that he alluded to the fact that he believed that I had never had someone who believed in me, and that's not true.
[03:24:41.125 --> 03:24:42.865]  I've had grade school teachers who have believed in me.
[03:24:42.905 --> 03:24:53.850]  I think everyone has had that, but I don't think it happens enough, and I think that a lot of what you're speaking to with the things that you wish, you know,
[03:24:54.440 --> 03:24:57.541]  Things you wish would change comes from the schools.
[03:24:57.801 --> 03:25:00.162]  Well you need to not, here's the deal, you need to not procrastinate.
[03:25:00.523 --> 03:25:03.664]  You need to let yourself be in other organizations and not at the top.
[03:25:04.104 --> 03:25:08.186]  And learn that if you just execute and innovate, you'll be moved to the top immediately.
[03:25:08.506 --> 03:25:08.826]  Alright.
[03:25:09.466 --> 03:25:16.349]  Look, people are looking for people who will just do what they're told, understand the information, and then move up in the hierarchy of things.
[03:25:16.810 --> 03:25:19.791]  And you'll find once you move up in the hierarchy of things that it's actually a big responsibility.
[03:25:20.171 --> 03:25:25.833]  But it does advance your mental clarity, understanding as you learn how to deal with more responsibility, more stress.
[03:25:25.853 --> 03:25:26.253]  You understand?
[03:25:26.393 --> 03:25:26.573]  Yeah.
[03:25:27.173 --> 03:25:30.174]  And that's what the whole hierarchy of needs in life is about.
[03:25:30.214 --> 03:25:33.536]  And it's about ascending to the level of where you actually want to then help others.
[03:25:34.116 --> 03:25:34.576]  Like your son.
[03:25:34.836 --> 03:25:35.376]  Which you want to do.
[03:25:36.157 --> 03:25:37.377]  So you aspire to that.
[03:25:37.397 --> 03:25:37.997]  It's not about helping.
[03:25:38.017 --> 03:25:38.577]  He's my son.
[03:25:38.797 --> 03:25:39.058]  I know.
[03:25:39.118 --> 03:25:45.100]  But you have to sacrifice and not do things the way you want them every time to get in the position to get your son back.
[03:25:47.380 --> 03:25:47.620]  Maybe.
[03:25:48.601 --> 03:25:48.741]  No!
[03:25:50.455 --> 03:25:52.236]  Without sacrifice, there's nothing, my friend.
[03:25:52.736 --> 03:25:55.357]  Let's bring Jake Lloyd in and Drew wants to get in and whoever else.
[03:25:56.838 --> 03:26:00.780]  Yeah, so I guess what I'm wondering is where is your motivation?
[03:26:00.980 --> 03:26:03.762]  Like, did you ever have any dreams when you were a kid?
[03:26:03.782 --> 03:26:05.483]  Did you have any motivation or anything?
[03:26:05.503 --> 03:26:08.204]  Because I guess it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
[03:26:08.224 --> 03:26:09.925]  I mean, I joined the Army at 17.
[03:26:10.425 --> 03:26:10.965]  I got out.
[03:26:11.105 --> 03:26:15.748]  I'm working here and I'm 21 years old and I feel like I'm not motivated enough because I measure up
[03:26:16.388 --> 03:26:23.270]  I measure myself against people in the past, like Teddy Roosevelt, people who were doing great things in the past, and I'm doing what I'm doing now.
[03:26:23.310 --> 03:26:24.070]  It's good, but it's not that.
[03:26:24.090 --> 03:26:26.911]  So I don't, I guess, I'm just curious, where is your motivation in life?
[03:26:27.211 --> 03:26:30.212]  And if it's to get your son back, what are you doing to get him back?
[03:26:30.732 --> 03:26:39.754]  Because you say, oh, he's incredibly important to me, he's all that I, you know, the biggest thing in my life, but that doesn't seem to be true because you're not acting that out in your life.
[03:26:41.104 --> 03:26:51.170]  I've been going through a very arduous and costly and time-consuming legal process to try and get him back, based on the fact that I was entitled to get him back.
[03:26:52.050 --> 03:26:54.812]  Not based on the fact that I need to have a job.
[03:26:55.372 --> 03:26:56.133]  You do need a job.
[03:26:56.953 --> 03:26:57.654]  You do need a job.
[03:26:57.874 --> 03:26:58.494]  People need income.
[03:26:58.514 --> 03:27:01.096]  Yeah, you need a job just to support your kids.
[03:27:01.116 --> 03:27:04.658]  Listen, you described on air in an off-air that the court basically found you incompetent.
[03:27:05.745 --> 03:27:08.147]  That is a reasonable characterization of what happened, yeah.
[03:27:08.528 --> 03:27:11.170]  Because it is incompetent if you won't get out of your parents' house at 30.
[03:27:11.210 --> 03:27:14.193]  It is incompetent if you won't do the things it takes to get stuff done.
[03:27:15.334 --> 03:27:16.935]  I mean, that's not fair to the kid.
[03:27:17.155 --> 03:27:20.879]  That's not fair to your kid at all if you're going to not have a job, if you're going to live at your parents' house.
[03:27:21.319 --> 03:27:24.001]  I mean, that's not raising him properly.
[03:27:24.041 --> 03:27:25.883]  And I'm not trying to jump on you here, man.
[03:27:25.903 --> 03:27:26.724]  I'm trying to help you.
[03:27:27.324 --> 03:27:27.605]  Alright.
[03:27:29.807 --> 03:27:31.448]  Have you ever been in a physical fight?
[03:27:31.868 --> 03:27:32.029]  Yeah.
[03:27:32.881 --> 03:27:37.247]  I'm not saying that's a great thing, that's generally a lot of folks... It happens to a lot of people.
[03:27:37.448 --> 03:27:37.888]  How old were you?
[03:27:39.831 --> 03:27:40.292]  Which time?
[03:27:40.893 --> 03:27:42.094]  I'm just seeing if you've lived any.
[03:27:43.056 --> 03:27:43.637]  Have I lived any?
[03:27:43.817 --> 03:27:44.037]  Yes.
[03:27:44.177 --> 03:27:44.898]  Yeah, a few.
[03:27:45.780 --> 03:27:47.162]  Alright, great points Jake Lloyd.
[03:27:47.182 --> 03:27:48.203]  Let's bring in the next question.
[03:27:48.283 --> 03:27:49.245]  Who wants to get in here next?
[03:27:53.985 --> 03:27:54.745]  Oh, can y'all hear me?
[03:27:54.825 --> 03:27:55.185]  I'm on?
[03:27:55.325 --> 03:27:55.426]  Yeah.
[03:27:55.466 --> 03:27:56.326]  I can hear you great.
[03:27:56.366 --> 03:27:57.326]  And we're going to hold you over.
[03:27:57.606 --> 03:27:58.366]  Start your question.
[03:27:58.607 --> 03:28:01.387]  So I'm naturally lazy as well.
[03:28:02.048 --> 03:28:07.570]  But with that being said, I'm almost 30 now, done a lot of stuff with my life.
[03:28:07.710 --> 03:28:14.472]  So what I'm really asking you is what has, besides your kid, what has been your biggest achievement since you've been an adult?
[03:28:19.033 --> 03:28:20.514]  I have not considered anything like that.
[03:28:23.072 --> 03:28:24.153]  My biggest achievement?
[03:28:28.276 --> 03:28:30.298]  You haven't considered anything an achievement since then?
[03:28:30.358 --> 03:28:35.222]  No, I haven't considered what my... I'm trying to think of one thing that I would consider to be an achievement, and I'm having a hard time.
[03:28:36.163 --> 03:28:37.424]  That seems to be a problem.
[03:28:37.504 --> 03:28:38.765]  Yeah, that is a bad time.
[03:28:38.845 --> 03:28:39.505]  Stay there, Drew.
[03:28:40.026 --> 03:28:40.907]  I'll tell you your achievement.
[03:28:41.147 --> 03:28:41.347]  What?
[03:28:41.427 --> 03:28:47.452]  You finally started to fight when they kicked your ass out of the nest, which is the beginning of how they're trying to help you, and now you're on InfoWars.
[03:28:48.853 --> 03:28:49.634]  Because I'm a slacker?
[03:28:50.541 --> 03:28:51.362]  Because I was a slacker?
[03:28:51.862 --> 03:28:52.964]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:28:53.784 --> 03:29:00.631]  We're going to transform you from slacker man to super hair man!
[03:29:01.512 --> 03:29:02.413]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[03:29:02.433 --> 03:29:05.076]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[03:29:05.496 --> 03:29:10.621]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.

[03:29:30.683 --> 03:29:41.446]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.

[03:30:00.493 --> 03:30:02.115]  We need your support.
[03:30:07.899 --> 03:30:16.106]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[03:30:16.126 --> 03:30:16.667]  Yes, yes.
[03:30:17.567 --> 03:30:20.990]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.591]  That's right.
[03:30:22.552 --> 03:30:22.732]  Yes.
[03:30:23.452 --> 03:30:32.375]  I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[03:30:33.315 --> 03:30:34.095]  Was it difficult?
[03:30:36.476 --> 03:30:37.797]  Not at all.
[03:30:38.037 --> 03:30:39.357]  Soros is very powerful.
[03:30:39.877 --> 03:30:48.460]  Ezra Levant called him out for this Nazi thing many years ago, and Ezra has been in lawfare with, I'm convinced, with Soros-funded people.
[03:30:49.121 --> 03:30:49.661]  Ever since.
[03:30:49.842 --> 03:30:54.429]  But the irony of all this is, you know where that 60 Minutes reporter got his information from?
[03:30:55.150 --> 03:30:56.592]  George Soros!
[03:30:57.322 --> 03:31:01.605]  If you want to know about his Nazi involvement, check out his books.
[03:31:02.025 --> 03:31:03.926]  He's the one who let the cat out of the bag.
[03:31:04.126 --> 03:31:07.868]  I'm sure it's something he deeply regrets now, but he let the cat out of the bag.
[03:31:07.888 --> 03:31:14.812]  Oh, no, no, I've been told, that's why I've been sued 12 times by Democrats, is that Hillary's butthurt and that leave George Soros alone.
[03:31:15.172 --> 03:31:20.636]  No, I'm going to start having giant conferences about the Nazi collaborator George Soros, and I'm calling for his arrest.
[03:31:20.676 --> 03:31:22.197]  So keep suing, brother.
[03:31:22.497 --> 03:31:23.217]  I'm never giving in.
[03:31:23.237 --> 03:31:23.797]  I love it.
[03:31:23.837 --> 03:31:24.178]  Let's go.
[03:31:25.138 --> 03:31:29.523]  You know, if you get an argument for a 14-year-old trying to survive, okay, I can get with that.
[03:31:29.823 --> 03:31:34.807]  But how about the, whatever that was, the 65-year-old, 75-year-old talking about how he doesn't regret it?
[03:31:34.827 --> 03:31:39.132]  I was just saying to my buddy today, I beat up David McIntosh in fourth grade.
[03:31:39.412 --> 03:31:41.274]  I threw him in the creek that goes behind our school.
[03:31:41.634 --> 03:31:42.655]  I feel bad about that.
[03:31:43.115 --> 03:31:44.757]  But David McIntosh lived.
[03:31:45.637 --> 03:31:51.041]  And he received zero Zyklon B in my grade school.
[03:31:51.522 --> 03:31:55.805]  George Sos was responsible for I don't know how many... Thousands.
[03:31:55.845 --> 03:31:59.307]  He was a collaborator and then said, I feel good about it.
[03:31:59.988 --> 03:32:00.988]  I'd do it over again.
[03:32:01.168 --> 03:32:02.209]  Someone else would have done it.
[03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:04.070]  It's a very sociopathic statement.
[03:32:05.151 --> 03:32:10.375]  If an enemy took over my country and said, help us round up fellow Americans or we'll kill you, I wouldn't do it.
[03:32:10.655 --> 03:32:11.856]  You know what's really going on here?
[03:32:11.976 --> 03:32:13.877]  Once again, it's their identity politics.
[03:32:13.917 --> 03:32:19.381]  And you say something bad about a group, like globalists, and they go, well, a lot of globalists are Jews, so you hate Jews.
[03:32:19.441 --> 03:32:20.983]  And you go, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:32:21.563 --> 03:32:22.984]  I am an idea man.
[03:32:23.064 --> 03:32:24.565]  We are ideas people.
[03:32:24.865 --> 03:32:27.207]  And our idea is nationalism.
[03:32:27.547 --> 03:32:29.169]  Someone else's idea is globalism.
[03:32:29.489 --> 03:32:33.051]  I don't care what group, what kind of people are on either side.
[03:32:33.111 --> 03:32:33.972]  I don't deal in that.
[03:32:34.032 --> 03:32:35.413]  I don't deal in identity politics.
[03:32:35.793 --> 03:32:36.574]  I deal with ideas.
[03:32:36.634 --> 03:32:37.715]  And my idea is,
[03:32:38.195 --> 03:32:39.216]  The West is the best.
[03:32:39.637 --> 03:32:40.919]  America is the greatest nation.
[03:32:40.999 --> 03:32:42.400]  And I want to protect this nation.
[03:32:42.681 --> 03:32:43.922]  I don't want open borders.
[03:32:44.203 --> 03:32:49.028]  I don't care what color, what religion, what specifics other people have.
[03:32:49.449 --> 03:32:51.171]  All I care about is those ideas.
[03:32:51.551 --> 03:32:52.873]  Western Showbiz.
[03:32:52.933 --> 03:32:57.038]  If you're pro-America, pro-Western, pro-success, pro-freedom, you can be purple.
[03:32:57.078 --> 03:32:57.539]  We love you.
[03:33:06.031 --> 03:33:08.645]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.982 --> 03:33:36.363]  All right, Craig Shroyer.
[03:33:53.377 --> 03:33:53.997]  Cross their names.
[03:33:54.137 --> 03:33:59.439]  Owen Schroyer and Saw Man is also here with us today.
[03:33:59.819 --> 03:34:03.019]  So there's so much to get to, so much to go over.
[03:34:03.059 --> 03:34:06.980]  There's going to be a veteran special today that they're going to have for three hours.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:09.381]  Owen Schroyer and Craig Schroyer.
[03:34:09.801 --> 03:34:13.582]  That's like saying she shucked she shells by the seashore.
[03:34:14.102 --> 03:34:15.763]  I'm having trouble saying it.
[03:34:15.803 --> 03:34:19.926]  Both names are easy to say, but when you say them combined together, it gets a little hard.
[03:34:20.287 --> 03:34:27.192]  So Owen Schroer and Craig Sawyer, veterans call in special show ahead of Memorial Day this Monday.
[03:34:27.532 --> 03:34:33.757]  A voice for our veterans, what's happening in the VA, what they think of Trump, all the things that are happening, the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[03:34:33.777 --> 03:34:34.837]  That's at 3 p.m.
[03:34:34.897 --> 03:34:36.298]  today in about an hour.
[03:34:37.400 --> 03:34:39.564]  And a half from now.
[03:34:39.684 --> 03:34:43.452]  Please tell everybody about InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:34:43.793 --> 03:34:44.875]  Please share the link.
[03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:50.211]  For folks, and please tell people about the local radio and TV stations that you're tuning into.
[03:34:50.251 --> 03:34:56.033]  We'll be talking to Craig and Owen in the next segment about what's coming up in the War Room today.
[03:34:56.513 --> 03:35:11.118]  Roger Stone's also supposed to pop in right now, but I may just do that in the first five minutes of the next hour, just to point out that he's now been told by the Mueller people, yeah, it's not Russiagate, we're looking at your finances to put your ass in prison, and you better, they've telegraphed,
[03:35:11.678 --> 03:35:13.539]  You better turn your back on the President.
[03:35:14.040 --> 03:35:17.342]  And Giuliani went on Fox and said they know Roger's not going to do that.
[03:35:18.162 --> 03:35:24.166]  Roger told me last night and he said today on the news that he's not turning his back because there's nothing to turn his back on.
[03:35:24.386 --> 03:35:28.529]  There's nothing been done, nothing illegal, nothing wrong, no nothing.
[03:35:28.929 --> 03:35:36.434]  And so Craig, talking to you, your buddy also just won the Congressional Medal of Honor yesterday from the same team that you were on.
[03:35:36.454 --> 03:35:38.055]  I guess his nickname's Slab.
[03:35:38.075 --> 03:35:40.176]  You're going to be breaking that down as well.
[03:35:40.216 --> 03:35:41.037]  So tell us what's coming up.
[03:35:42.520 --> 03:35:43.461]  Well, yeah.
[03:35:43.521 --> 03:35:47.783]  Britt Slabinski was on my sniper crew for years in the SEAL teams.
[03:35:47.823 --> 03:35:51.866]  He's a great guy and he got the Medal of Honor yesterday from the President.
[03:35:52.226 --> 03:35:55.288]  It was an ugly battle and a lot of heartache there.
[03:35:55.588 --> 03:35:58.249]  I know Slab didn't even want the award.
[03:35:58.289 --> 03:36:04.693]  He's been awarded heavily prior to that and he's a warrior in every sense of the word.
[03:36:05.313 --> 03:36:09.376]  He's a reluctant recipient of that award due to the brothers left on
[03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:13.271]  That we lost in that battle, but that's the nature of battle.
[03:36:13.291 --> 03:36:14.052]  It's imperfect.
[03:36:14.072 --> 03:36:22.899]  Slab's a great warrior, but it's good to see him recognized, and all the guys at that level really deserve to be recognized for it.
[03:36:23.699 --> 03:36:27.302]  Great warriors defending our homeland against the unthinkable.
[03:36:27.422 --> 03:36:28.443]  So, God bless them all.
[03:36:29.753 --> 03:36:34.834]  I know on air, you'll really never talk about any of the operations you've been part of, obviously, because that's all classified.
[03:36:35.354 --> 03:36:40.155]  And are we even able to know the specifics of why he got the Congressional Medal of Honor?
[03:36:41.635 --> 03:36:47.776]  Yeah, they talked through the citation live on national television.
[03:36:47.996 --> 03:36:49.517]  The president actually read it.
[03:36:50.237 --> 03:36:52.437]  Well, I missed that yesterday because I was so busy with other things.
[03:36:52.637 --> 03:36:55.358]  So we're going to re-air that today, coming up during the war room.
[03:36:55.378 --> 03:36:57.138]  We'll find that and air that, because that's important.
[03:36:58.035 --> 03:36:58.455]  Yeah, man.
[03:36:58.495 --> 03:37:04.959]  Yeah, those guys deserve to be recognized, and Slab deserves to be recognized for his contributions on the field of battle there.
[03:37:05.900 --> 03:37:06.800]  Just amazing stuff.
[03:37:07.621 --> 03:37:09.422]  Now, let's juxtapose that, not in a mean way.
[03:37:09.462 --> 03:37:13.324]  I'm sure you've heard of Michael Rotondo, the 30-year-old that wouldn't get out of his parents' house?
[03:37:15.385 --> 03:37:16.106]  Only briefly.
[03:37:16.166 --> 03:37:17.707]  I've been quite busy running our
[03:37:19.002 --> 03:37:20.443]  Operations for the children, Alex.
[03:37:20.483 --> 03:37:22.164]  So I get glimpses of the news.
[03:37:22.725 --> 03:37:24.085]  And that's what we'll talk about in the next segment.
[03:37:24.125 --> 03:37:27.167]  Boy, is Trump and you guys and everybody really delivering.
[03:37:27.187 --> 03:37:31.150]  There are just massive pedophile roundups going on, but we can't get into it all.
[03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:35.093]  The numbers are out there, like eight, nine times the previous number under Obama.
[03:37:35.633 --> 03:37:38.115]  And the left's really panicking, and more and more of this is coming out.
[03:37:38.935 --> 03:37:41.057]  But that's definitely panicking the globalists right now.
[03:37:42.297 --> 03:37:42.938]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:37:43.098 --> 03:37:45.319]  Well, there's a
[03:37:46.844 --> 03:37:49.267]  Massive struggle for power over the United States.
[03:37:49.427 --> 03:38:01.540]  We see it getting more desperate on the left, on the globalist side, as Trump makes more progress and gets his footing as commander-in-chief of the United States and starts exposing more of the truth.
[03:38:01.820 --> 03:38:05.785]  The globalists and the radical left are getting more and more desperate.
[03:38:05.825 --> 03:38:06.546]  So it's interesting.
[03:38:07.086 --> 03:38:08.187]  These are interesting times.
[03:38:08.367 --> 03:38:09.228]  Highly contested.
[03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:11.451]  So, we'll stand by and watch.
[03:38:26.337 --> 03:38:28.738]  We got Drew and some other folks have questions for you.
[03:38:29.218 --> 03:38:29.438]  Great.
[03:38:29.899 --> 03:38:30.519]  You can respond back.
[03:38:30.579 --> 03:38:32.000]  I got something, Alex, if you don't mind.
[03:38:32.540 --> 03:38:32.920]  Sure.
[03:38:33.500 --> 03:38:34.221]  Can I interject?
[03:38:34.501 --> 03:38:40.503]  I would just encourage him, look, if you love somebody, you want them empowered.
[03:38:40.703 --> 03:38:42.964]  Man, I teach my son everything that I can.
[03:38:43.025 --> 03:38:46.226]  And look at, take a Little League football team.
[03:38:46.246 --> 03:38:47.947]  Man, they train those boys hard.
[03:38:48.007 --> 03:38:48.187]  Why?
[03:38:48.227 --> 03:38:50.388]  Because they want them to be prepared to win.
[03:38:51.048 --> 03:38:52.953]  Or to perform well during the game.
[03:38:52.993 --> 03:38:54.737]  And we all want that for our kids, man.
[03:38:55.238 --> 03:38:56.881]  And so sometimes, love.
[03:38:56.921 --> 03:38:59.266]  If you really care about somebody, you want them empowered.
[03:38:59.327 --> 03:39:01.291]  And growth is always difficult.
[03:39:01.994 --> 03:39:05.698]  It's sometimes painful, but it's beneficial.
[03:39:05.878 --> 03:39:14.647]  So I would encourage this guy, hey look, his life has been what it has been until now, but before him lies unlimited potential.
[03:39:15.127 --> 03:39:22.535]  And I would say push through the discomfort of growing into a more responsible man and going for his better self.
[03:39:23.559 --> 03:39:37.546]  Exactly, because I saw the media just put him down and call him names, and I'm trying to kick him in the butt to get him thinking, but if you look at how he had to pay for all the illegal aliens and all the anchor babies, and for people's sex changes, that's far more lazy and bad than him.
[03:39:37.986 --> 03:39:39.987]  So then how is he the worst guy in America?
[03:39:40.007 --> 03:39:42.969]  That's basically what they said this week, and then they ignore all the rest of this stuff.
[03:39:43.209 --> 03:39:44.270]  He becomes a scapegoat.
[03:39:44.290 --> 03:39:47.991]  I'm not saying you're a victim, I'm just saying on a scale of laziness, you're kind of in the middle.
[03:39:48.091 --> 03:39:48.832]  You're not the worst guy.
[03:39:49.915 --> 03:39:50.595]  It sounds reasonable.
[03:39:51.455 --> 03:39:59.917]  I wanted to answer a question I got earlier where someone asked me what my greatest accomplishment was, and it's my belief that I've raised a child who is smarter than I was.
[03:40:00.237 --> 03:40:00.977]  Besides your son.
[03:40:01.877 --> 03:40:02.518]  Oh, besides that?
[03:40:02.678 --> 03:40:05.858]  Yeah, besides your son, what has been your greatest achievement since you turned 18?
[03:40:06.298 --> 03:40:08.179]  Oh, that's what I prepared as the answer for that.
[03:40:08.199 --> 03:40:08.819]  You prepared it?
[03:40:08.959 --> 03:40:09.539]  Yeah.
[03:40:09.599 --> 03:40:10.119]  That's the problem.
[03:40:10.199 --> 03:40:12.540]  It took you that long through the break to think of one, though.
[03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:14.160]  How am I supposed to come in before the break?
[03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:18.801]  Okay, well, without that, would you say that your life has been fulfilling?
[03:40:19.481 --> 03:40:19.681]  Yeah.
[03:40:21.159 --> 03:40:26.726]  In what way being as though you haven't, you can't even find out what you've achieved.
[03:40:26.946 --> 03:40:28.328]  You can't even answer what you've achieved.
[03:40:28.868 --> 03:40:29.850]  How do you feel fulfilled?
[03:40:31.532 --> 03:40:33.935]  I feel like I can accomplish what I seek to.
[03:40:35.612 --> 03:40:42.375]  Or, if I can't accomplish what I was attempting to, I've made accomplishments in order to get there.
[03:40:42.875 --> 03:40:44.296]  Well, listen, I'm not trying to put you down.
[03:40:44.956 --> 03:40:45.356]  Thanks, Drew.
[03:40:45.376 --> 03:40:46.076]  Let's bring Daria on.
[03:40:46.116 --> 03:40:48.577]  Let's make her get on here, because I know she's had some comments.
[03:40:48.597 --> 03:40:50.918]  She didn't want to get on air, but she said she did earlier.
[03:40:50.938 --> 03:40:53.199]  Daria, get over here, because I'm not trying to be mean to you.
[03:40:53.219 --> 03:40:54.840]  You've got to get out of the comfort zone, like you said.
[03:40:54.860 --> 03:40:56.281]  And just do little things.
[03:40:56.321 --> 03:40:57.101]  Just get a job.
[03:41:00.134 --> 03:41:04.397]  Well I just think Alex, you said something... That's not Daria, that's Owen.
[03:41:04.437 --> 03:41:05.317]  She refuses to go on.
[03:41:05.698 --> 03:41:07.259]  I think that Alex was right though, Michael.
[03:41:07.299 --> 03:41:12.382]  Your greatest accomplishment was this legal battle with your parents to live at home or not live at home.
[03:41:12.542 --> 03:41:14.543]  You finally fought for something.
[03:41:14.643 --> 03:41:18.166]  This is going to be the moment in your life that changes everything.
[03:41:18.386 --> 03:41:19.026]  I have a feeling for it.
[03:41:19.046 --> 03:41:20.147]  You have good energy, Michael.
[03:41:20.387 --> 03:41:20.687]  Thank you.
[03:41:21.868 --> 03:41:22.649]  Trying to be positive.
[03:41:22.709 --> 03:41:23.789]  Daria was going to get on air.
[03:41:23.809 --> 03:41:26.191]  I don't know where she is.
[03:41:26.211 --> 03:41:29.073]  Does anybody else, the minute and a half we have left, want to talk to him?
[03:41:29.093 --> 03:41:29.313]  Go ahead.
[03:41:30.230 --> 03:41:30.911]  Can I ask you a question?
[03:41:32.713 --> 03:41:33.715]  You want to ask Owen a question or me?
[03:41:33.775 --> 03:41:34.756]  Owen, can I ask you a question?
[03:41:34.776 --> 03:41:35.317]  Yeah, what's up?
[03:41:36.098 --> 03:41:38.281]  Or no, I forgot what this gentleman's name is over here.
[03:41:38.641 --> 03:41:38.882]  Drew?
[03:41:39.102 --> 03:41:39.422]  Drew!
[03:41:39.602 --> 03:41:40.484]  Drew, get Drew on here.
[03:41:41.946 --> 03:41:43.227]  No, this gentleman, who's the guy?
[03:41:43.267 --> 03:41:43.848]  Saw Man!
[03:41:43.888 --> 03:41:44.589]  Saw Man!
[03:41:44.849 --> 03:41:45.190]  Saw Man!
[03:41:45.971 --> 03:41:46.492]  Go ahead, buddy.
[03:41:48.171 --> 03:41:49.232]  Is that on your birth certificate?
[03:41:49.252 --> 03:41:50.292]  Craig Sawyer.
[03:41:51.413 --> 03:41:52.293]  He was a mall cop.
[03:41:52.874 --> 03:41:56.156]  Craig, feel free to just disregard my question because it's complicated.
[03:41:56.936 --> 03:41:58.337]  Do you have a scope?
[03:41:58.357 --> 03:42:03.040]  Do you have a theater scale where you can... We said a minute and a half, buddy, so be quick.
[03:42:03.140 --> 03:42:11.745]  Do you have a theater scale where you can share with us the scope of some of the things that these men who've been awarded the Medal of Honor...
[03:42:12.930 --> 03:42:14.331]  Can you share with us what they've done?
[03:42:14.371 --> 03:42:16.072]  Well, that would take about 5,000 hours.
[03:42:16.972 --> 03:42:21.575]  For this thing here or for that thing there?
[03:42:21.875 --> 03:42:23.816]  The word hero exists for guys like that.
[03:42:23.937 --> 03:42:24.837]  I mean, that's what they do.
[03:42:24.877 --> 03:42:25.337]  They earn it.
[03:42:25.397 --> 03:42:30.981]  They disregard their own safety and they run to save their buddies from the unthinkable.
[03:42:31.041 --> 03:42:33.822]  They fight through things that normal people would not.
[03:42:33.862 --> 03:42:35.483]  That's what the Medal of Honor is all about.
[03:42:36.584 --> 03:42:38.185]  We celebrate those who earn it.
[03:42:38.365 --> 03:42:41.387]  Can't talk about anything specifically about what they were involved in?
[03:42:41.407 --> 03:42:43.909]  Well, we're going to get to this one because this was declassified.
[03:42:44.249 --> 03:42:44.789]  Oh yeah?
[03:42:44.809 --> 03:42:47.871]  When he's hosting for three hours coming up, we're going to pull that up.
[03:42:48.772 --> 03:42:50.393]  The gentleman getting the medal of honor yesterday, the seal.
[03:42:50.833 --> 03:42:54.115]  Listen, we're going to be talking more once this show's over.
[03:42:54.235 --> 03:42:55.656]  So, you've done a great job.
[03:42:55.676 --> 03:42:57.217]  You made $3,000 coming here.
[03:42:57.377 --> 03:42:57.557]  Yeah.
[03:42:57.577 --> 03:42:58.518]  It's part of capitalism.
[03:42:58.538 --> 03:42:59.238]  See how that did for you?
[03:42:59.278 --> 03:43:00.179]  Are you happy so far?
[03:43:00.339 --> 03:43:01.200]  Yes, you got out of the house.
[03:43:01.220 --> 03:43:01.640]  See what happened?
[03:43:03.840 --> 03:43:22.149]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I'm not gonna speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[03:43:22.230 --> 03:43:27.632]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[03:43:27.692 --> 03:43:29.193]  It's a great deal at $39.
[03:43:29.313 --> 03:43:32.475]  Immune wall, beta glucans, olive leaf,
[03:43:33.115 --> 03:43:34.096]  And so much more.
[03:43:34.656 --> 03:43:35.797]  It is concentrated.
[03:43:36.017 --> 03:43:37.719]  You need to go read what is in here.
[03:43:37.739 --> 03:43:43.423]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[03:43:43.543 --> 03:43:44.744]  A citrus peel blend.
[03:43:44.764 --> 03:43:46.705]  I mean, this is the next level.
[03:43:46.785 --> 03:43:49.167]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[03:43:49.367 --> 03:43:50.628]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[03:43:50.808 --> 03:43:52.630]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[03:43:53.170 --> 03:43:53.791]  Immune Wall.

[03:46:12.345 --> 03:46:13.466]  This is what we act like!
[03:46:14.046 --> 03:46:15.506]  This is what everybody was like before us!
[03:46:15.886 --> 03:46:16.706]  This is what I am!
[03:46:16.726 --> 03:46:17.687]  I'm a throwback!
[03:46:17.907 --> 03:46:18.427]  I'm here!
[03:46:18.747 --> 03:46:20.247]  I've got the fire of human liberty!

[03:46:27.309 --> 03:46:28.629]  Make no mistake, parasites!
[03:46:29.469 --> 03:46:31.910]  It's fun!
[03:46:39.721 --> 03:46:40.576]  It's fun.
[03:47:07.370 --> 03:47:10.133]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.718 --> 03:47:19.201]  We're all living in America!
[03:47:19.561 --> 03:47:23.124]  America is wunderbar!
[03:47:23.405 --> 03:47:26.728]  We're all living in America!
[03:47:49.031 --> 03:47:50.392]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:47:50.412 --> 03:47:52.293]  We're getting Craig back on a Skype drop.
[03:47:52.753 --> 03:47:59.557]  Owen Schroer, you're going to be hosting a three-hour transmission with Craig, a veterans call-in, just for veterans to call in.
[03:47:59.577 --> 03:48:03.520]  Obviously, you'll be covering some of the news, but that's coming up in about an hour and 13 minutes.
[03:48:03.920 --> 03:48:08.803]  With the war room, well, you see the attack that InfoWars is under.
[03:48:09.143 --> 03:48:14.326]  And I haven't even plugged, but maybe one minute, a minute and a half to the last two hours plus.
[03:48:14.746 --> 03:48:16.307]  Most talk show hosts plug every segment.
[03:48:16.407 --> 03:48:17.028]  I should plug.
[03:48:18.248 --> 03:48:18.789]  Every segment.
[03:48:18.829 --> 03:48:23.332]  Then I wouldn't have to sit up here and freak out about expanding in the face of the globalists.
[03:48:23.352 --> 03:48:31.459]  But people have to understand, there's something called Trumpnesia with a lot of people who think since Trump's in, everything's okay.
[03:48:31.739 --> 03:48:33.881]  The total war is on right now.
[03:48:34.181 --> 03:48:35.142]  A lot of people get that.
[03:48:35.742 --> 03:48:36.623]  A lot of people don't.
[03:48:36.643 --> 03:48:37.664]  But let me tell you who does get it.
[03:48:38.706 --> 03:48:43.850]  The left are in their maximum push, and the more desperate they get, the more desperate they get.
[03:48:44.290 --> 03:48:47.012]  The more out of control they get, the more out of control they get.
[03:48:47.272 --> 03:48:54.698]  The more they lie and it doesn't work, they quadruple and quintuple, and just leverage it into total cloud cuckoo land.
[03:48:55.479 --> 03:49:05.626]  And we are winning, but let me tell you, and I'm not complaining, I asked for this, I just don't want to personally have the pleasure of tearing us to pieces, because they're certainly trying, as you can see all over the news.
[03:49:05.646 --> 03:49:06.227]  The good news is,
[03:49:07.617 --> 03:49:08.758]  I led the broadcast with this.
[03:49:08.778 --> 03:49:11.200]  I want to get Craig back on, separate from the veterans.
[03:49:11.220 --> 03:49:11.801]  That's important.
[03:49:12.541 --> 03:49:17.246]  Because he's helping a lot of folks lead the charge to round up the pedophile rings and all the rest of it.
[03:49:17.666 --> 03:49:18.567]  It's really happening.
[03:49:19.147 --> 03:49:24.712]  And everything we were told about Weinstein is now coming out, thanks to Schneiderman getting removed.
[03:49:24.752 --> 03:49:25.693]  He was protecting him.
[03:49:26.093 --> 03:49:28.395]  And this is the real counter-strike.
[03:49:28.495 --> 03:49:32.559]  This is Trump's counter-strike, as we told you was coming in November of 2016.
[03:49:35.001 --> 03:49:42.004]  And Drudge linking to our spirit cooking articles, and you know, exposing the pedophile rings, and then them creating side diversions that were honeypots for us.
[03:49:42.325 --> 03:49:43.945]  Were not perfect, some of us fell into them.
[03:49:44.305 --> 03:49:45.646]  You know, the distractions with Pizzagate.
[03:49:46.086 --> 03:49:50.008]  But now, the real counter-offensive is taking place.
[03:49:50.408 --> 03:49:51.109]  This is a big deal.
[03:49:51.249 --> 03:49:51.409]  Owen?
[03:49:52.540 --> 03:50:01.126]  Well, like you said, I mean, even the night of the election, though, Alex, you had some reservations about celebrating because you said, I know that the left is going to push back.
[03:50:01.226 --> 03:50:04.469]  You know, we just had a major victory, but the globalists are not going to go away.
[03:50:04.869 --> 03:50:06.430]  You know, they've invested so much in this.
[03:50:06.470 --> 03:50:09.492]  Well, it's like you take a port in a war, but then
[03:50:10.753 --> 03:50:12.474]  50 ships come pulling around the corner to retake it.
[03:50:12.514 --> 03:50:13.675]  I mean, we're in a war.
[03:50:14.156 --> 03:50:15.576]  We've not won the war yet.
[03:50:15.617 --> 03:50:19.119]  Yeah, we won a Death Star-level destruction event.
[03:50:19.539 --> 03:50:22.481]  But as we all know, just because you blow the Death Star up doesn't mean the Empire's still ain't out there.
[03:50:22.641 --> 03:50:24.402]  Well, the globalists have a survival instinct, too.
[03:50:25.103 --> 03:50:27.304]  And their ideology has a survival instinct.
[03:50:28.065 --> 03:50:34.949]  And that's the key here that I actually broke down with Doug Hagman yesterday in the War Room, is that the reason why they're engaged in such
[03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.711]  We're good to go.
[03:50:54.102 --> 03:50:57.925]  Though I don't like to call it that, close quote The View, they're saying we're making it up.
[03:50:58.125 --> 03:50:58.865]  They still deny it.
[03:50:59.306 --> 03:51:00.246]  Adam Schiff on Twitter.
[03:51:00.506 --> 03:51:01.167]  Eric Swalwell on Twitter.
[03:51:01.207 --> 03:51:03.348]  There was no spying, it's fake news from the right.
[03:51:03.368 --> 03:51:07.291]  And it's like, wait a second, we just got that from James Clapper, even though we already knew that was going on.
[03:51:07.651 --> 03:51:09.893]  But it's all a survival instinct.
[03:51:09.913 --> 03:51:15.737]  They know that they're against the robes, and they know that if Trump isn't defeated or removed from office, that they're done.
[03:51:16.337 --> 03:51:25.959]  Their stranglehold over the country, the communist, socialist, whatever you want to call it, that they try to bring this government down with, is in dire straits right now.
[03:51:26.019 --> 03:51:28.860]  Absolutely, and I wanted Sawman on the last segment.
[03:51:28.960 --> 03:51:29.940]  They got him on a little bit earlier.
[03:51:29.960 --> 03:51:31.220]  I want to get him back on, guys.
[03:51:31.240 --> 03:51:36.802]  And I want to get the Congressional Medal of Honor thing that was done on Fox yesterday, because we're going to air that before this show ends.
[03:51:37.362 --> 03:51:37.602]  I'm gonna...
[03:51:38.482 --> 03:51:39.963]  Countermand or that's not the word.
[03:51:40.243 --> 03:51:42.764]  I'm going to commandeer some of the next hour.
[03:51:43.164 --> 03:51:45.745]  So just I'm telegraphing that to everybody because that's about enough.
[03:51:45.765 --> 03:51:47.666]  If you want to play the full thing, it's about 20 minutes.
[03:51:48.367 --> 03:51:50.708]  The full entire presentation.
[03:51:50.788 --> 03:51:51.588]  So you carried it?
[03:51:52.289 --> 03:51:52.689]  I've got it.
[03:51:52.769 --> 03:51:54.410]  I've got it queued up to play on the war room.
[03:51:54.430 --> 03:51:57.171]  Okay, well, I want to play just some of it here then when he gives it.
[03:51:58.071 --> 03:51:59.852]  Because Obama got rid of this.
[03:52:00.052 --> 03:52:01.032]  Well, think about this, Alex.
[03:52:01.052 --> 03:52:03.333]  Like you said, you didn't see this yesterday.
[03:52:03.373 --> 03:52:05.173]  It really didn't get much TV coverage.
[03:52:05.193 --> 03:52:06.874]  I mean, very little coverage in the Medal of Honor.
[03:52:07.194 --> 03:52:10.515]  I remember when Obama handed out any award, it was a huge TV event.
[03:52:10.535 --> 03:52:11.875]  They had the whole camera crews there.
[03:52:11.915 --> 03:52:12.875]  Everybody made a big deal of it.
[03:52:12.895 --> 03:52:14.196]  But Trump hands out a Medal of Honor.
[03:52:14.216 --> 03:52:16.496]  It seems like nobody even bats an eye.
[03:52:16.697 --> 03:52:19.497]  Just like the MS-13 roundtable, nobody bats an eye.
[03:52:19.517 --> 03:52:21.378]  That was an incredibly powerful event.
[03:52:21.798 --> 03:52:33.644]  Just like the Republicans and a 50-minute public presser announcing that it's time for a special counsel in the Clinton email investigation and the origins of the Trump- These things just get no coverage.
[03:52:34.585 --> 03:52:35.825]  These things get no coverage.
[03:52:37.206 --> 03:52:39.327]  And it's just incredible to think, why?
[03:52:39.587 --> 03:52:40.848]  Why wouldn't somebody cover
[03:52:42.017 --> 03:52:47.059]  An MS-13 roundtable where they come out with the news, and this is, I mean, this is huge, right?
[03:52:47.079 --> 03:52:50.241]  I mean, why wouldn't anybody be talking about gangs?
[03:52:50.581 --> 03:52:55.283]  We're talking about gangs that murder, rape, traffic in children, etc.
[03:52:55.663 --> 03:52:56.864]  Sell drugs, all of it.
[03:52:57.564 --> 03:52:58.745]  Violent gangs.
[03:53:00.565 --> 03:53:03.887]  Sneaking into this country using children.
[03:53:04.947 --> 03:53:07.208]  Using children to get in.
[03:53:07.869 --> 03:53:10.330]  It's just like, people don't take what we say seriously.
[03:53:11.152 --> 03:53:13.616]  MS-13 knows how to get around the system.
[03:53:14.718 --> 03:53:16.140]  That's not just rhetoric.
[03:53:16.861 --> 03:53:22.870]  It's pretty simple to figure out, oh okay, if I come in with a kid or two, they're gonna let me in!
[03:53:23.988 --> 03:53:25.709]  Wow, MS-13 has a brain too.
[03:53:26.109 --> 03:53:29.592]  They bring in the kids with their gang members, and then what do you have?
[03:53:29.752 --> 03:53:32.714]  Unaccompanied children in the country that we have to take care of.
[03:53:33.134 --> 03:53:37.337]  And this is totally ignored by mainstream press, even though it should be top news.
[03:53:37.898 --> 03:53:39.038]  And let me expand on that.
[03:53:39.699 --> 03:53:42.040]  MS-13 is the most hated in Mexico.
[03:53:42.881 --> 03:53:44.301]  Because they're out of El Salvador.
[03:53:44.882 --> 03:53:46.322]  They're literally devil worshippers.
[03:53:46.362 --> 03:53:52.784]  They're the worst gang in... They set the precedent back 15 years ago or so to start killing kids.
[03:53:53.444 --> 03:53:57.006]  Nobody would kill kids in any Latin American gang because they had some basic chivalry.
[03:53:58.186 --> 03:54:02.167]  Now they're killing kids, something previously only Muslims would do on purpose.
[03:54:02.747 --> 03:54:04.648]  So, I mean, these guys are worse than animals.
[03:54:04.768 --> 03:54:06.809]  Animals kill for food.
[03:54:08.050 --> 03:54:09.111]  Animals kill to survive.
[03:54:09.131 --> 03:54:14.196]  These people do it because it's a cult of who can be the nastiest, meanest, most disgusting person.
[03:54:14.997 --> 03:54:18.440]  And, you know, these are the guys that are running the coyote operations.
[03:54:18.460 --> 03:54:27.749]  These are the guys that are so ruthless, they're taking over the Mexican gangs, and then the Mexican gangs are adopting their psychology when we got 150 million Mexicans in Mexico.
[03:54:30.111 --> 03:54:32.432]  And you've got probably 20, 30 million illegals here.
[03:54:32.812 --> 03:54:34.433]  You don't want them adopting this.
[03:54:34.453 --> 03:54:37.575]  I mean, this is like adopting Nazism or something.
[03:54:37.935 --> 03:54:43.997]  And the president simply says this, and they go, how dare you say Hispanics are animals.
[03:54:44.518 --> 03:54:47.799]  But let me just make a comment real quick on the animals thing.
[03:54:50.021 --> 03:54:52.723]  The entire left freaks out over Trump saying animals.
[03:54:53.484 --> 03:54:56.326]  Wait a second, you claim we're animals through evolution.
[03:54:56.667 --> 03:54:59.850]  So they literally teach in science that we're animals.
[03:55:00.050 --> 03:55:01.171]  That's their science.
[03:55:01.451 --> 03:55:04.294]  They want their science that teaches we're animals.
[03:55:04.334 --> 03:55:04.915]  Of course, of course.
[03:55:04.975 --> 03:55:05.976]  Babies aren't even humans.
[03:55:06.036 --> 03:55:06.516]  Chop them up.
[03:55:06.997 --> 03:55:10.640]  But then Trump says animals, speaking of gang members, and they throw their hands in the air.
[03:55:10.660 --> 03:55:12.101]  They're chopping babies up.
[03:55:12.862 --> 03:55:18.588]  But now they're saying, everyone has the spark of divinity, these are God's children, and they said, oh, well, Pelosi didn't mean them.
[03:55:18.829 --> 03:55:23.133]  Then a bunch of Democrats come out and they go, no, we mean MS-13, including Juan Williams.
[03:55:23.614 --> 03:55:28.359]  And let me add this, that's why I'm saying everybody points their fingers at Michael Rotondo.
[03:55:29.600 --> 03:55:32.203]  And they go, look, this guy's the biggest bum in the galaxy.
[03:55:33.374 --> 03:55:35.675]  And I think he's got some quirky, you know, issues.
[03:55:35.695 --> 03:55:37.055]  I don't think he's a bad guy.
[03:55:37.075 --> 03:55:38.516]  I think he's been, you know, shut in.
[03:55:38.836 --> 03:55:49.679]  He's nothing compared to making us pay for MS-13 to bring women in who have babies by design to give them an anchor in the United States to bring up to 10 more people in.
[03:55:49.959 --> 03:55:55.680]  We're paying for MS-13 women to have babies on record to pay for everything for them.
[03:55:56.000 --> 03:55:57.401]  That is BS!
[03:55:58.413 --> 03:56:05.438]  And this is what a welfare state does, and even though its intentions may be good, even though the intentions of whatever... But it's not at the top.
[03:56:05.518 --> 03:56:06.479]  You read LBJ.
[03:56:06.699 --> 03:56:08.040]  He said the blacks are getting... But it never works.
[03:56:08.060 --> 03:56:08.461]  These are quotes.
[03:56:08.481 --> 03:56:11.103]  I don't even want to say the quotes because they'll edit it and say I said it.
[03:56:11.403 --> 03:56:12.624]  He said blacks are getting uppity.
[03:56:14.431 --> 03:56:18.495]  Because they oppressed them so they created their own economies and in some areas were getting wealthier than whites.
[03:56:18.515 --> 03:56:19.817]  It's like Kanye West now, too.
[03:56:19.837 --> 03:56:20.878]  You know, he's getting a little uppity.
[03:56:20.898 --> 03:56:22.439]  They need to, you know, send him back to the Middle East.
[03:56:22.499 --> 03:56:22.920]  Exactly.
[03:56:22.960 --> 03:56:23.480]  Listen, folks.

[03:57:57.700 --> 03:57:58.221]  Thanks for holding.
[03:57:58.281 --> 03:57:59.201]  Hey Alex, mate.
[03:57:59.621 --> 03:58:03.263]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[03:58:03.323 --> 03:58:12.048]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[03:58:12.188 --> 03:58:28.350]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX Body, it's all amazing.
[03:58:28.850 --> 03:58:37.378]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[03:58:37.438 --> 03:58:42.202]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[03:58:42.342 --> 03:58:47.947]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
