[00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.774]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.200]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:44.605]  I'm your fill-in host for today, Mike Adams, the health ranger here in Austin, Texas, joining the War for Liberty, standing up for your right to speak your mind.
[00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:50.808]  Today's show is a special on censorship, tyranny on parade, and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:50.928 --> 00:00:53.469]  Alex is out today, but of course he'll be back soon.
[00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.850]  We've got so much to cover today.
[00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.073]  This segment, of course, isn't carried by all affiliates, so the real big bombshell headlines begin after the coming break.
[00:01:01.113 --> 00:01:03.234]  But let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:11.178]  We've got a teaser announcement of a new uncensored video community that's being announced.
[00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:21.564]  We've got a list of 10 things that you can do right now to help fight tyranny and censorship being pushed by leftist tech companies like YouTube, Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and others.
[00:01:22.324 --> 00:01:24.965]  We've also got a report today in the third hour.
[00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:36.747]  A shocking finding about how aborted babies are literally being flushed down city sewers, turned into bio-sludge, and put back on our food crops as fertilizer.
[00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:38.267]  That's not hyperbole.
[00:01:38.307 --> 00:01:39.487]  It's not an exaggeration.
[00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:42.648]  It is a 100% true shocking story.
[00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:44.949]  We'll be bringing you that and much more.
[00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.509]  We've got Jim Hoff coming up from the Gateway Pundit.
[00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:51.630]  He's coming up in the second hour, an interview with Jim about censorship and tyranny.
[00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:55.594]  And I'll be taking your listener calls today, so feel free to call in.
[00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.155]  We're going to light up the phone lines and take a lot of calls from you.
[00:01:58.675 --> 00:01:59.855]  I'm going to love to hear from you.
[00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:04.917]  It has been four, almost five years since I last hosted this show.
[00:02:05.497 --> 00:02:07.798]  And I think probably you're wondering why.
[00:02:07.838 --> 00:02:12.600]  I remember when I last hosted in 2013, a lot of people said, hey, where'd the health ranger go?
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.681]  How come he's not filling in anymore?
[00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:16.601]  And I'm back.
[00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:18.262]  I got to say, you know, for the last few years,
[00:02:19.042 --> 00:02:20.223]  I focused on different things.
[00:02:20.463 --> 00:02:22.404]  I built a laboratory, a science lab.
[00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:28.027]  It's a world-class scientific analysis laboratory using mass spec instruments and so on.
[00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.728]  I learned how to fly airplanes.
[00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:32.409]  I did a lot of interesting things.
[00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:39.732]  But coming back now, four years later, just seeing the InfoWars operation, it is so much larger.
[00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:41.413]  It is so professional.
[00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.035]  The people here are on task.
[00:02:44.115 --> 00:02:47.056]  They are super dedicated to this job.
[00:02:47.156 --> 00:02:48.217]  It's really impressive to me.
[00:02:48.777 --> 00:03:09.542]  I mean this, Alex has built, I mean not alone, I mean with your help and other people's input, but Alex has built a world-class news organization here that I believe as we move into the collapse of the mainstream media and the complete discrediting of CNN, which is now using gang-style tactics to try to shut down Infowars,
[00:03:10.502 --> 00:03:16.444]  I see InfoWars as being the replacement, the truth media for America, so to speak.
[00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:21.066]  And I say this as an independent observer, you know, an outside person coming in to guest host.
[00:03:22.087 --> 00:03:26.348]  And I'm not part of the InfoWars operation, but I believe in the mission of liberty.
[00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:30.990]  And I see this operation as something incredibly powerful for America.
[00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:38.753]  And it's no wonder CNN is trying to shut down InfoWars, that all of these operations are committing, you know, economic sabotage.
[00:03:39.173 --> 00:03:44.355]  To try to make sure that InfoWars doesn't make any money and yet you are standing up as the resistance.
[00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:46.295]  You're supporting the InfoWars store.
[00:03:46.335 --> 00:03:48.196]  You're giving InfoWars a revenue stream.
[00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:55.958]  You're making sure they've got the money to fight back and fight for your liberties and fight for your right to speak and fighting against the lies of the mainstream media.
[00:03:56.618 --> 00:04:05.365]  You know, this is teleprompter-free, genuine, authentic, pro-liberty, pro-America, broadcast central right here.
[00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:06.206]  That's what this is!
[00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:08.348]  And that's why I'm excited to be here today.
[00:04:08.368 --> 00:04:10.850]  And that's why I want to take your calls, because I want to hear from you.
[00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.831]  I'm excited to be back.
[00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.173]  I thank Alex for inviting me back to be part of this.
[00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:17.355]  I knew I couldn't stay away forever.
[00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.218]  You know, the fight for liberty needs all of us, all of our voices.
[00:04:20.738 --> 00:04:22.319]  And I'm being targeted now, too.
[00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.021]  I was censored on Saturday.
[00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:28.084]  YouTube shut down my entire account, terminated my whole account.
[00:04:28.144 --> 00:04:32.868]  It was called The Health Ranger terminated on Tuesday, on Saturday.
[00:04:33.549 --> 00:04:38.012]  And here we are trying to fight for liberty and free speech, but we're being attacked at every angle.
[00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:40.915]  So when we come back, the bombshells really begin.
[00:04:41.055 --> 00:04:41.575]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:41.635 --> 00:04:42.916]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:43.277 --> 00:04:44.558]  Mike Adams filling in today.
[00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.035]  Yes.
[00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:08.234]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:05:08.294 --> 00:05:09.735]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:05:09.795 --> 00:05:10.155]  Go ahead.
[00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:10.555]  Yes.
[00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:11.695]  Hi, Alex.
[00:05:11.815 --> 00:05:17.996]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:05:18.216 --> 00:05:22.197]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:05:22.437 --> 00:05:23.877]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:30.938]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.879]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.464]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:05:39.504 --> 00:05:47.330]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.195]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:58.639]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.722]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:06:04.713 --> 00:06:09.656]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.921]  I'm going to try to be as calm as I can on this Tuesday broadcast.
[00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.783]  This is Alex Jones reporting from the road.
[00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:27.646]  Mike Adams of Natural News is about to be hosting the transmission here in just a few minutes.
[00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:39.212]  I needed to address several giant deceptions by mainstream media, by corporate dinosaur-prestitute media, because they're pointed directly at we the people.
[00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:47.974]  These attacks on InfoWars, in their own words, are precedent-setting cases to shut down the free internet as we know it.
[00:06:49.394 --> 00:06:55.896]  Now let me just briefly recap what's happened in the last two weeks.
[00:06:57.423 --> 00:07:01.724]  Two false EEOC complaints were filed against me.
[00:07:01.744 --> 00:07:05.566]  The lawyer on the case is Hillary Rodham Clinton's personal lawyer.
[00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:07.406]  You cannot make this up.
[00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:09.847]  And they are completely fraudulent and fake.
[00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:19.230]  On top of that, there have been eight Democratic Party-financed lawsuits against me and InfoWars in the last year.
[00:07:21.658 --> 00:07:37.417]  A new lawsuit was filed yesterday by the man that claims he has the trademark for Pepe the Frog, claiming I infringed on it when we don't even use the frog as a symbol or promote it, but we did sell a poster, an art poster that a listener
[00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:50.341]  made titled Make America Great Again that had a bunch of images of symbols that were popular during the campaign that are part of popular culture and completely protected by fair use.
[00:07:50.401 --> 00:08:05.032]  It's like saying you can't paint a picture of John Wayne, or you can't paint a picture of Abraham Lincoln, or you can't paint a picture of Axel Rhodes, of the rock band Guns N' Roses, or you can't paint a picture
[00:08:06.678 --> 00:08:07.018]  I don't
[00:08:28.393 --> 00:08:30.974]  That their plan is to shut us down with lawsuits.
[00:08:31.854 --> 00:08:35.215]  And they're doing this to a lot of other prominent conservatives, a lot of other prominent libertarians.
[00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:40.938]  They're sending a message that if you stand up and you tell the truth, we're going to shut you down.
[00:08:42.058 --> 00:08:43.899]  So, nine lawsuits.
[00:08:45.779 --> 00:08:50.181]  Fake EEOC filings, which will become a lawsuit if it goes to the next level.
[00:08:50.221 --> 00:08:52.902]  So that's ten lawsuits, excuse me, correction.
[00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:56.589]  Ten lawsuits since Trump was elected.
[00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:58.911]  But notice, now it's one every week.
[00:09:00.053 --> 00:09:02.015]  It took a year to do eight, now it's one every week.
[00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:04.478]  This is the strategy.
[00:09:05.719 --> 00:09:07.561]  It's the Democratic Party and their cohorts.
[00:09:08.202 --> 00:09:09.083]  There is no morals.
[00:09:10.148 --> 00:09:11.448]  There is no decency.
[00:09:12.249 --> 00:09:13.029]  There is no honor.
[00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:15.650]  There is just do whatever they want.
[00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:24.513]  Just like the Nazis said everybody they were attacking were subhuman, and so they had a right to be vicious and hateful and evil and not play by any rules.
[00:09:25.193 --> 00:09:26.533]  It's the same thing with the Democrats.
[00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:32.375]  They have all said that we are Nazis, so now they can act like Nazis.
[00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.976]  Now the reason I raise this is
[00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:40.282]  I haven't taken off a family vacation close to a year, and I'm just taking a few days off of my children.
[00:09:41.483 --> 00:09:47.664]  And I'm responding to this, and I'm getting hundreds of phone calls from the press, hundreds of emails are coming into the office.
[00:09:48.444 --> 00:09:50.005]  We can't even keep track of it all.
[00:09:51.245 --> 00:09:55.246]  And in the midst of all of this, here's the biggest fraud of them all.
[00:09:56.909 --> 00:10:01.495]  You have the lawsuits, you have the fake EEOC stuff, you have all the rest of the stuff going on.
[00:10:02.016 --> 00:10:09.706]  Oh, you have CNN organizing, trying to block the publishing of my book with Neil Strauss, The War for the Future.
[00:10:09.726 --> 00:10:11.248]  Don't forget that a month ago.
[00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:13.531]  Then you have CNN two weeks ago.
[00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:19.684]  Running the operation, saying that they're contacting YouTube trying to get us shut down.
[00:10:20.464 --> 00:10:24.567]  Now you have CNN running a week-long campaign to have our sponsors pulled.
[00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:30.090]  But because they've already demonetized us on YouTube and taken our sponsors, we went and looked at the account over the weekend.
[00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:31.410]  We're going to do a story on this.
[00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:39.535]  Big advertisers like the UN and Nike, they went and bought $20 to $160, depending on the buy.
[00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:39.875]  That's nothing.
[00:10:44.082 --> 00:10:55.294]  On our account through YouTube, through the ad agency at YouTube so they could pull it and say they pulled support to create this image that I'm losing, to create this consensus that I'm fake news, that I'm a criminal, that I'm bad.
[00:10:56.295 --> 00:10:59.618]  So all of this is negative PR ahead of
[00:11:00.874 --> 00:11:03.595]  I believe criminal charges or they may try to assassinate me.
[00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:05.275]  That's what the top experts believe.
[00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:05.996]  That's what I believe.
[00:11:06.556 --> 00:11:07.976]  Clearly, this is how this program works.
[00:11:07.996 --> 00:11:08.956]  First, they demonize you.
[00:11:09.317 --> 00:11:10.277]  Then they silence you.
[00:11:11.517 --> 00:11:12.297]  Then they set you up.
[00:11:12.337 --> 00:11:13.558]  They imprison you or they kill you.
[00:11:13.938 --> 00:11:15.899]  And of course, Media Matters made a big joke about that.
[00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:18.559]  But they know George Soros, a Nazi collaborator, funds them and runs them.
[00:11:18.919 --> 00:11:19.800]  They know this is serious.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.560]  They know they're hashtag hunt Republicans.
[00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:24.561]  They know they're trying to kill the president.
[00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:25.341]  They know.
[00:11:25.361 --> 00:11:30.063]  And when I say that, the Democratic Party, people like Phil Mudd on CNN, you know, saying we're going to kill this guy.
[00:11:31.496 --> 00:11:34.157]  They're trying to bully us into submission, and that's what this whole thing is.
[00:11:34.597 --> 00:11:44.361]  So people see an example of InfoWars with all these anti-free speech people piling on and suing us and attacking us and attacking our sponsors and attacking us publishing books.
[00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:50.423]  People hear this and then they think, well, I better not stick my head up against globalism.
[00:11:50.783 --> 00:11:51.503]  They'll destroy me.
[00:11:53.584 --> 00:11:58.986]  Now enter the next lie from the same folks that gave you the PPgate dossier and promoted it at BuzzFeed.
[00:12:00.816 --> 00:12:03.880]  They come out of the weekend and say, Jones made all this up.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.803]  There were no YouTube strikes, basically.
[00:12:07.223 --> 00:12:08.685]  He was never going to be shut down.
[00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:10.808]  He doesn't have any contacts in YouTube.
[00:12:10.848 --> 00:12:11.528]  None of this happened.
[00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.352]  So you saw weeks of them trying to shut us down.
[00:12:15.373 --> 00:12:18.176]  Celebrations all over magazines and publications.
[00:12:18.216 --> 00:12:20.318]  Yay, Alex Jones is about to be shut down.
[00:12:21.963 --> 00:12:26.725]  And then BuzzFeed comes out with others and says, no, Jones made it up.
[00:12:27.625 --> 00:12:38.030]  The Washington Post today says, Jones just made the Parkland shooting tragedy a week-long news cycle about him.
[00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.050]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.011]  They lie about what we say about Parkland.
[00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.352]  They use that to say we should be silenced off the web.
[00:12:44.652 --> 00:12:46.213]  Incredible draconian control.
[00:12:48.274 --> 00:12:50.135]  They keep putting strikes on us, four total.
[00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:56.577]  YouTube removes them three separate times and admits people hijacked their systems, that's in Bloomberg, and The Verge.
[00:12:58.458 --> 00:12:59.619]  This is epic stuff going on.
[00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:05.541]  YouTube backs off but leaves one strike on there where we can't livestream on the Alex Jones Channel, removes three others.
[00:13:05.821 --> 00:13:09.963]  When you've got three strikes, you're looking on your account, that means you're shut down.
[00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.884]  And they had frozen our account where no uploads could happen.
[00:13:13.184 --> 00:13:16.866]  Then they removed it for a third time, Saturday night.
[00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.992]  We start uploading on Sunday.
[00:13:19.012 --> 00:13:20.755]  And the Washington Post says, see?
[00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:21.717]  He's uploading.
[00:13:21.757 --> 00:13:22.298]  He's lying.
[00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:23.140]  It never happened.
[00:13:23.761 --> 00:13:26.385]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:33.650]  That's how dumb they think everybody is when we've all seen them pile on with everything they've got.
[00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.114]  And when they fail, they then say it never happened because they think you don't have an attention span.
[00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:43.217]  Remember, they hinge everything on you having no attention span.
[00:13:43.478 --> 00:13:44.859]  But we're going to take this audio.
[00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:47.301]  We're going to put articles up over every piece of it.
[00:13:48.263 --> 00:13:52.649]  We're going to show people what I'm talking about, step by step, of what they've done.
[00:13:52.869 --> 00:14:01.039]  And then finally, when they do the third strike and do remove us, they say, Jones cried wolf a lot, but finally, for doing bad things, he was banned.
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.542]  And the precedent is set for everyone.
[00:14:04.676 --> 00:14:06.037]  And that's why people took this so serious.
[00:14:06.337 --> 00:14:14.684]  They saw thousands of other conservative, libertarian, centrist, liberal, veteran sites, gun sites removed in the last week as well.
[00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:17.085]  There was a huge purge on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.
[00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:18.867]  And in other places.
[00:14:19.447 --> 00:14:21.929]  And lawsuits filed against the NRA and all this other crap.
[00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.051]  And then they sit there and say, none of this is happening.
[00:14:25.172 --> 00:14:28.734]  Think of their disrespect for the truth and their disrespect for you.
[00:14:30.307 --> 00:14:30.407]  I'm
[00:14:46.111 --> 00:14:54.678]  All they were covering was the left being censored around the world, and how NPR is fighting censorship, and how in other countries free speech gets suppressed.
[00:14:54.798 --> 00:14:58.681]  It was always Latin America or something, never China, where it actually counts, to cover it.
[00:14:59.141 --> 00:15:01.523]  China basically runs our country now, to a great extent.
[00:15:01.563 --> 00:15:02.344]  Trump's trying to change that.
[00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:07.386]  But it was all about how much they, that fake NPR voice, care about free speech.
[00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:14.532]  When the left aren't the left here, they're a bunch of fascist controllers and a giant gang trying to set everybody's free speech down.
[00:15:14.552 --> 00:15:16.854]  So that's what's happening.
[00:15:17.134 --> 00:15:18.195]  That's what's going on.
[00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.637]  That's the next level of this whole thing.
[00:15:21.438 --> 00:15:26.482]  And because you've stood beside us and have prayed for us and spread the articles and videos and
[00:15:27.963 --> 00:15:29.064]  All right, back to the live transmission.
[00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:30.605]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:33.207]  I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:35.769]  If you're watching and listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:16:02.692 --> 00:16:07.934]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[00:16:08.674 --> 00:16:11.955]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[00:16:12.815 --> 00:16:18.396]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:16:20.857 --> 00:16:27.199]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:33.261]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:45.985]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:52.191]  Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[00:16:52.972 --> 00:16:56.496]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.

[00:17:06.758 --> 00:17:09.860]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.400]  You're on the air.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.601]  Thanks for holding.
[00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:12.461]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[00:17:12.681 --> 00:17:13.262]  Hey, brother.
[00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:13.942]  Good, man.
[00:17:13.982 --> 00:17:14.782]  Thank you for calling.
[00:17:14.863 --> 00:17:19.905]  Hey, I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[00:17:20.426 --> 00:17:26.509]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[00:17:26.649 --> 00:17:28.570]  I mean, it's all good stuff.
[00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:35.254]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[00:17:35.674 --> 00:17:36.855]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[00:17:36.915 --> 00:17:40.919]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.981]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[00:17:43.382 --> 00:17:44.122]  And exactly.
[00:17:44.142 --> 00:17:48.427]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:48.987]  Boom!
[00:17:49.127 --> 00:17:51.970]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:52.551]  It's amazing.
[00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:56.855]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[00:18:02.176 --> 00:18:06.057]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:06.597 --> 00:18:13.999]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:18:14.699 --> 00:18:19.400]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.920]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.981]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:29.242]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:18:29.922 --> 00:18:36.564]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:44.405]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:18:45.286 --> 00:18:51.927]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:18:52.487 --> 00:18:53.587]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.768]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:56.608 --> 00:18:59.549]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:19:00.089 --> 00:19:01.869]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:07.591]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowarslife.
[00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:12.332]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:20.994]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[00:19:21.354 --> 00:19:24.575]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[00:19:24.855 --> 00:19:29.782]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:37.072]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[00:19:37.413 --> 00:19:41.018]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[00:19:41.318 --> 00:19:41.839]  That's why.
[00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:45.661]  Increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:53.806]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[00:19:54.126 --> 00:19:58.029]  Head to Infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.
[00:19:58.309 --> 00:19:59.730]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:06.574 --> 00:20:09.275]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:27.652 --> 00:20:32.101]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:35.468]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:57.293 --> 00:20:57.814]  And we're back.
[00:20:57.854 --> 00:20:59.115]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:59.156 --> 00:21:02.440]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in today for Alex.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:12.292]  You just heard him in the last segment with an emergency audio broadcast talking about the extreme attacks on InfoWars, the extreme censorship, even the
[00:21:12.793 --> 00:21:12.993]  I think?
[00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.393]  You know, someone who runs my own operation, National News.
[00:21:36.853 --> 00:21:37.613]  It is happening.
[00:21:37.714 --> 00:21:43.896]  In fact, on Saturday, my entire YouTube channel, called The Health Ranger, was terminated.
[00:21:44.676 --> 00:21:46.177]  And it is happening across the board.
[00:21:46.197 --> 00:21:48.398]  I heard from other people whose accounts were being terminated.
[00:21:48.918 --> 00:21:51.959]  And YouTube, by the way, they didn't even have the courtesy of giving me three strikes.
[00:21:52.539 --> 00:22:01.123]  They went from zero strikes for more than 10 years, to two strikes virtually overnight, to all of a sudden terminated.
[00:22:01.163 --> 00:22:01.903]  So they skipped.
[00:22:02.423 --> 00:22:03.083]  Three strikes.
[00:22:03.523 --> 00:22:06.384]  YouTube's new policy, I guess, is two strikes and you're out.
[00:22:07.104 --> 00:22:14.366]  And today, here on the Alex Jones Show, we're going to have Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit joining us at the top of the next hour.
[00:22:14.906 --> 00:22:17.227]  He's also been censored and he's written about the censorship.
[00:22:17.267 --> 00:22:20.948]  He's compiled the top conservative websites that are being censored.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:28.726]  We're also going to be joined briefly in the third hour by Gary Franchi from Next News Network, who's also being censored.
[00:22:28.746 --> 00:22:32.170]  You know, the examples of this are all over.
[00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.271]  They're across the board.
[00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:34.592]  The purge is on.
[00:22:35.373 --> 00:22:43.400]  And what's crucial to understand about this is that this censorship from these tech giants comes from a place of not strength, but weakness.
[00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:49.925]  They have to censor these independent voices because they know they are losing the info war.
[00:22:50.585 --> 00:22:52.966]  In other words, info wars is winning.
[00:22:53.047 --> 00:22:53.947]  The truth is winning.
[00:22:54.027 --> 00:22:55.328]  People want to be informed.
[00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:57.769]  People want to know the truth about what's really happening.
[00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.232]  And every time the establishment tries to censor voices,
[00:23:01.972 --> 00:23:02.252]  Of course.
[00:23:25.086 --> 00:23:30.850]  And here's another piece of irony about all of that, that their censorship actually is a form of bullying.
[00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:33.212]  They are bullying the independent media.
[00:23:33.252 --> 00:23:34.953]  They are bullying InfoWars.
[00:23:35.093 --> 00:23:36.815]  CNN is bullying InfoWars.
[00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:41.018]  CNN is invoking now gang-style tactics.
[00:23:41.078 --> 00:23:47.623]  Today on InfoWars.com, CNN turns to outright gangsterism to silence Alex Jones.
[00:23:48.223 --> 00:23:56.804]  Washington Post just published a story in the last hour talking about how Alex Jones turned the Parkland shooting into a week-long news cycle about himself.
[00:23:57.145 --> 00:24:02.525]  You know what the Washington Post is saying is, how dare you complain that you're being targeted for censorship?
[00:24:02.865 --> 00:24:09.527]  How dare you complain that CNN is using gangster-style tactics to try to commit economic sabotage against you?
[00:24:09.947 --> 00:24:11.347]  How dare you speak out?
[00:24:11.387 --> 00:24:15.108]  It's like they're standing over you with a baseball bat and saying, oh, you have free speech?
[00:24:15.248 --> 00:24:15.688]  Bam!
[00:24:15.828 --> 00:24:17.528]  They whack you in the face with a baseball bat.
[00:24:17.788 --> 00:24:18.568]  Why aren't you speaking?
[00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:18.989]  Wham!
[00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.809]  You have free speech.
[00:24:19.869 --> 00:24:20.109]  Wham!
[00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:22.571]  How dare you complain you're being hit with a baseball bat.
[00:24:22.591 --> 00:24:23.251]  That's what it's like.
[00:24:24.252 --> 00:24:27.633]  And I see this as an outside observer, as an independent publisher.
[00:24:28.974 --> 00:24:30.755]  Completely separate from the InfoWars organization.
[00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:31.716]  You know, I'm not an employee here.
[00:24:32.827 --> 00:24:36.169]  But I see what's happening and it's happening to me and it's happening to others.
[00:24:36.509 --> 00:24:37.590]  The purge is on.
[00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.270]  It's real.
[00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:47.795]  And it is an admission of weakness by the legacy media, by the establishment, by the tech giants who know they are going to lose everything if
[00:24:49.036 --> 00:24:52.798]  Conservative voices and independent voices and pro-liberty voices are allowed to speak out.
[00:24:53.338 --> 00:24:54.238]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:24:54.278 --> 00:24:58.440]  Because, you know, these tech companies, they are saturated with weakness.
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:08.605]  They're saturated with these Snowflakian, left-wing, fragile, neurologically house-of-cards people.
[00:25:08.785 --> 00:25:10.506]  They think words are weapons.
[00:25:11.006 --> 00:25:12.187]  So they can't stand words.
[00:25:12.907 --> 00:25:14.427]  That disagree with them.
[00:25:14.887 --> 00:25:16.268]  So they have to silence the words.
[00:25:16.288 --> 00:25:27.150]  Remember before the election in 2016, when some students would write Trump in chalk on the sidewalks of student campuses, and other students would freak out and they would be traumatized.
[00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:27.610]  Trauma!
[00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:27.930]  Trauma!
[00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.431]  We saw Trump on the sidewalk, written in chalk!
[00:25:30.451 --> 00:25:32.171]  Oh, it's going to wash off in the next rain.
[00:25:32.191 --> 00:25:32.751]  Don't worry.
[00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:34.011]  But it's still trauma.
[00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:36.812]  They had to go get counseling because they think words are weapons.
[00:25:37.512 --> 00:25:47.683]  Now these people are serving as the censors and the so-called trusted flaggers inside YouTube and inside, you know, Google and Facebook, and they are triggered by words that they don't agree with.
[00:25:47.723 --> 00:25:50.646]  They're triggered by the words that describe what they are.
[00:25:50.686 --> 00:25:52.148]  They're triggered by the word snowflake.
[00:25:52.648 --> 00:25:54.569]  That is a snowflakian trigger.
[00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:56.529]  The word snowflake triggers snowflakes!
[00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:11.155]  And so they become bullies to try to bully independent channels by claiming that they're bullying, while CNN is stalking senior citizens in their own front yards and doxing them on live broadcasts, and claiming that Alex Jones is bullying people!
[00:26:11.175 --> 00:26:11.835]  You know what?
[00:26:11.915 --> 00:26:17.657]  Alex Jones didn't stalk old ladies in their front yards and accuse them of being Russian trolls, okay?
[00:26:18.137 --> 00:26:19.058]  Just for the record!
[00:26:19.918 --> 00:26:20.779]  It's insane.
[00:26:21.059 --> 00:26:23.581]  The stuff that is going on right now is absolutely insane.
[00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:26.383]  So, we're going to play a clip here.
[00:26:26.663 --> 00:26:27.664]  You're going to love this clip.
[00:26:28.225 --> 00:26:38.352]  This is, as I understand it, Karl Rove appeared on air doing something insane with his nose and mouth.
[00:26:38.513 --> 00:26:39.233]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:41.235]  Let's play the clip and then we'll respond to it.
[00:26:41.255 --> 00:26:41.515]  Go ahead.
[00:26:42.076 --> 00:26:48.138]  Similar jump in Dallas, which has one of the three seats occupied by a Republican, carried by Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:48.538 --> 00:26:50.979]  Not as big an increase in Fort Worth, Tarrant County.
[00:26:51.499 --> 00:26:57.961]  Another big increase in Bexar County, which has part of the third seat that's occupied by a Republican, won by Hillary Clinton.
[00:26:58.121 --> 00:27:00.722]  Oh my God, he has liquid coming out of his nostrils.
[00:27:00.962 --> 00:27:02.263]  I'm not even kidding.
[00:27:02.403 --> 00:27:02.703]  Carl, dude.
[00:27:02.743 --> 00:27:04.245]  Okay, for those on the radio, they're zooming in.
[00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:08.928]  I don't know what Carl Rove is trying to say here, but his nostrils look like a scene out of the original Lord of the Rings.
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.103]  Orcs scene.
[00:27:25.304 --> 00:27:25.724]  I'm sorry.
[00:27:26.486 --> 00:27:29.653]  It's just he's slurping.
[00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:32.138]  He's slurping the liquid coming out of his nose.
[00:27:32.219 --> 00:27:32.660]  I don't get it.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.301]  Carl.
[00:27:35.895 --> 00:27:36.155]  I hope.
[00:27:37.236 --> 00:27:44.658]  Oh my.
[00:27:45.239 --> 00:27:48.360]  Well, that's part of the Republican establishment there.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.061]  Mr. Slurpee slurping his own nostril juice.
[00:27:52.581 --> 00:27:53.222]  Very sad.
[00:27:53.242 --> 00:27:55.462]  I hope that never happens to me.
[00:27:55.482 --> 00:27:59.704]  I hope someone would alert me if something were going on with
[00:28:01.045 --> 00:28:08.368]  With my nostrils here on the Alex Jones Show, we got to keep a little bit light-hearted here because we are under extreme assault.
[00:28:08.748 --> 00:28:09.889]  Our liberties are under attack.
[00:28:10.609 --> 00:28:11.550]  Everything is at stake.
[00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.612]  The future of our country, our liberties, our right to speak our minds.
[00:28:15.672 --> 00:28:21.755]  And just the fact that we ran that clip and that I was able to say, hey, look at this guy, he's doing something crazy.
[00:28:22.455 --> 00:28:26.041]  The reason I did that is because it's an expression of free speech.
[00:28:26.382 --> 00:28:35.278]  It may not be beautiful, it may not be even polite, but it is part of the conversation of our society.
[00:28:36.164 --> 00:28:37.586]  We have the right to comment on things.
[00:28:37.666 --> 00:28:38.847]  We have the right to ask questions.
[00:28:38.907 --> 00:28:43.852]  We have the right to dissent against tyrannical views being pushed by the establishment.
[00:28:44.293 --> 00:28:46.475]  A lot more yet to come here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:46.515 --> 00:28:48.357]  Mike Adams filling in for Alex today.
[00:28:48.397 --> 00:28:48.878]  Stay with us.
[00:28:49.278 --> 00:28:53.383]  We'll be back with more interviews and an audio segment from Alex coming right up.
[00:29:02.901 --> 00:29:14.451]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[00:29:14.491 --> 00:29:15.432]  We're exposed to lead.
[00:29:15.472 --> 00:29:16.493]  We're exposed to mercury.
[00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:21.538]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[00:29:21.918 --> 00:29:26.923]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[00:29:27.023 --> 00:29:29.145]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[00:29:29.945 --> 00:29:31.326]  Well, causes you to gain weight.
[00:29:31.446 --> 00:29:35.068]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[00:29:35.168 --> 00:29:40.151]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:45.994]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[00:29:46.374 --> 00:29:51.597]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[00:29:51.957 --> 00:29:52.897]  And over and over again.
[00:29:52.977 --> 00:29:59.859]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:02.279]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[00:30:02.399 --> 00:30:03.940]  I mean, this is so massive.
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:17.263]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland.
[00:30:17.283 --> 00:30:17.963]  Fertility is key.
[00:30:18.523 --> 00:30:28.709]  Fertility, but all your glands are what, really, your pituitary gland, which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract, actually.
[00:30:28.749 --> 00:30:35.112]  The whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[00:30:35.513 --> 00:30:39.515]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[00:30:39.575 --> 00:30:43.097]  And you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill, and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying.
[00:30:43.577 --> 00:30:44.978]  All of a sudden, it was like, boom!
[00:30:45.418 --> 00:30:47.198]  I started losing weight, all this energy.
[00:30:47.218 --> 00:30:49.619]  I guess the iodine was sucking garbage out.
[00:30:49.959 --> 00:30:54.420]  It's as important as vitamin C. You gotta have vitamin C. You gotta have iodine to live.
[00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.480]  You gotta have water to live.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.141]  Get your Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine.

[00:32:02.853 --> 00:32:06.736]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:32:07.296 --> 00:32:14.702]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:32:15.402 --> 00:32:20.106]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:32:20.706 --> 00:32:22.607]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:32:23.228 --> 00:32:26.670]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:32:27.471 --> 00:32:29.933]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:32:30.618 --> 00:32:37.262]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:32:37.862 --> 00:32:45.107]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:32:45.967 --> 00:32:52.611]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:32:53.192 --> 00:32:54.272]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:32:54.633 --> 00:32:56.454]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[00:33:06.556 --> 00:33:09.157]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.787 --> 00:33:32.918]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:36.837 --> 00:33:38.478]  We're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:41.239]  Mike Adams here, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:44.360]  You may recall, last time I hosted this show was the year 2013.
[00:33:45.781 --> 00:33:57.766]  Before Trump won the election, before the censorship purge began for all independent media, including myself, I was targeted by YouTube on Saturday after I appeared as a guest on the Alex Jones Show last week.
[00:33:58.246 --> 00:34:00.967]  So don't let anybody tell you that there isn't a purge going on.
[00:34:01.267 --> 00:34:08.448]  And later today, at the second hour, we're going to be talking to Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit, who has also documented the censorship that's going on.
[00:34:08.849 --> 00:34:17.431]  The extreme purge that is taking place right now across the independent media got a couple of important concepts to run by you here.
[00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:22.692]  First is that why isn't anybody on the left speaking out against the censorship?
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:25.721]  They are seeing the purge happening.
[00:34:25.781 --> 00:34:28.762]  They know that InfoWars is being economically sabotaged.
[00:34:28.822 --> 00:34:31.264]  They see InfoWars under attack.
[00:34:31.304 --> 00:34:33.545]  They see Natural News, that's my site, under attack.
[00:34:33.585 --> 00:34:35.586]  They see the Gateway Pundit under attack.
[00:34:36.266 --> 00:34:41.849]  They see, you know, Breitbart people being banned off of Twitter, for example, or Shadowban on Facebook.
[00:34:42.249 --> 00:34:44.430]  They see it happening, and they love it.
[00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:52.614]  This is what's crucial to understand, is that the left is not opposed to censorship as long as they push the buttons and control who's censored.
[00:34:53.174 --> 00:34:55.755]  In other words, the left hates the First Amendment.
[00:34:56.155 --> 00:34:58.615]  The left, of course, also hates the Second Amendment.
[00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:00.476]  The left hates the Fourth Amendment.
[00:35:00.516 --> 00:35:05.337]  They weaponized the deep state to spy on Trump advisors and Trump officials.
[00:35:06.057 --> 00:35:09.838]  If you get down to it, the left hates everything that America was built on.
[00:35:09.878 --> 00:35:11.038]  They hate the Constitution.
[00:35:11.318 --> 00:35:12.459]  They hate the American flag.
[00:35:12.859 --> 00:35:13.839]  They hate Christianity.
[00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:15.239]  They hate the family.
[00:35:15.259 --> 00:35:16.960]  You ever notice that?
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.080]  They hate the word family.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.543]  They hate, it seems, white people sometimes for some reason, which is totally bizarre.
[00:35:24.303 --> 00:35:30.446]  And they definitely hate Alex Jones and they hate this operation, which is why this operation needs your support.
[00:35:30.486 --> 00:35:41.232]  Because we are so close to having absolute victory over the fake news, the fabricated media of the left, their false lies, the deep state being exposed, everything.
[00:35:41.772 --> 00:35:43.954]  Infowars is really the tip of the spear.
[00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:47.335]  So I do want to mention, by the way, there are ongoing
[00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:50.298]  Specials from Operation Paul Revere.
[00:35:50.318 --> 00:35:51.680]  Just go to infowarstore.com.
[00:35:52.281 --> 00:35:56.225]  You will find products that provide a revenue stream for this operation.
[00:35:56.265 --> 00:36:04.054]  You're funding, you're not just getting nutritional supplements, you're funding this InfoWar that stands up for your liberty and your free speech.
[00:36:06.863 --> 00:36:08.704]  What happens when leftists run society?
[00:36:09.425 --> 00:36:21.054]  If they take control, if they succeed in banning the First Amendment and the Second Amendment and wiping out all conservative voices across YouTube and Facebook, if the left is in charge, they run everything into the ground.
[00:36:21.114 --> 00:36:22.295]  They destroy societies.
[00:36:22.335 --> 00:36:25.237]  If you go down the spectrum of leftism, you get North Korea.
[00:36:25.738 --> 00:36:33.463]  You get thrown in the gulag or executed with like an 88mm cannon by Kim Jong-un if you speak out against him.
[00:36:34.564 --> 00:36:36.387]  I mean, look at the cities that the left runs.
[00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:43.836]  You know, San Francisco has so much human feces now all across the city that's practically a third world country at this point.
[00:36:43.896 --> 00:36:44.677]  It's so bad.
[00:36:45.198 --> 00:36:49.644]  They've got needles, heroin needles just strewn about all over the city streets and this is supposed to be a
[00:36:50.104 --> 00:36:51.605]  A mecca of leftism?
[00:36:52.226 --> 00:37:02.434]  This is Silicon Valley where all these ideas come from and they've got human feces everywhere that you have to have a map on your phone to know where you shouldn't step on the city streets?
[00:37:03.015 --> 00:37:04.476]  Because it's run by tyrants.
[00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:08.419]  It's run by people who despise logic and reason.
[00:37:08.939 --> 00:37:10.921]  Look at Los Angeles.
[00:37:10.941 --> 00:37:13.423]  58,000 homeless people now in Los Angeles County.
[00:37:14.524 --> 00:37:18.107]  The homeless problem is so bad that it's practically another shadow city there.
[00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:23.916]  This is the destitution, the desperation that leftism breeds.
[00:37:24.696 --> 00:37:38.622]  Every major city that's run by leftists is either the murder capital of America, or it has a homeless problem that is out of control, or it has a tyranny problem where all business owners are moving out of the city, or it has an unemployment problem, or it has a human feces problem.
[00:37:39.162 --> 00:37:40.582]  They want this for the whole nation.
[00:37:41.082 --> 00:37:41.783]  And think about this.
[00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:47.490]  These school shootings, they all happen, or 98% of them happen in gun-free zones, right?
[00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:51.415]  That's where the violence happens, because the left has said, let's have gun-free zones!
[00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:55.862]  And so the shooters say, well, let's go there because no one's going to shoot back.
[00:37:56.522 --> 00:38:00.422]  Think about the fact that the left wants to turn the entire country into a gun-free zone.
[00:38:01.123 --> 00:38:10.184]  And by that, they mean that the guns are in the hands of just the government officials, the police, that the left says are murdering people.
[00:38:10.904 --> 00:38:12.004]  So how do you get that?
[00:38:12.044 --> 00:38:14.425]  These contradictions are so out of control.
[00:38:14.445 --> 00:38:19.886]  The left, in order to be a leftist, you have to believe two contradictory ideas at the same time.
[00:38:20.626 --> 00:38:37.209]  And somehow believe they're both real, like the idea that police are bad, they say, and murdering people, and they want to kill the police, that's what they're chanting at some of these Black Lives Matter rallies, and then they want to say, well, no, let's give all the guns just to the police and to the federal agents and take the guns away from the citizens.
[00:38:38.584 --> 00:38:39.285]  It makes no sense.
[00:38:39.665 --> 00:38:40.566]  It's a contradiction.
[00:38:41.006 --> 00:38:45.190]  It's like they say Trump is Hitler, and then let's give Trump all the guns.
[00:38:45.651 --> 00:38:45.871]  What?
[00:38:46.292 --> 00:38:47.533]  Your logic makes no sense.
[00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:51.497]  It's like they say you gotta have diversity and equality.
[00:38:51.897 --> 00:38:52.598]  Well, let's see.
[00:38:53.298 --> 00:38:55.420]  Diversity means everybody's different.
[00:38:55.921 --> 00:38:57.763]  Equality means everybody's the same.
[00:38:58.303 --> 00:39:02.186]  You can't have diversity and equality at the same time.
[00:39:02.626 --> 00:39:13.675]  And by the way, when the left says diversity, what they mean is a group of obedient people all parroting the exact same words, the exact same phrases, but having different skin color in the same room.
[00:39:13.715 --> 00:39:14.075]  That's it.
[00:39:14.135 --> 00:39:15.196]  To them, that's diversity.
[00:39:15.236 --> 00:39:15.757]  It's skin deep.
[00:39:16.417 --> 00:39:30.446]  You know, someone from a different country, someone, a refugee, and here's an undocumented immigrant, they'll say, and here's an African-American, here's a white person, but they must all conform to the exact same obedient demands because the left has become a cult.
[00:39:31.287 --> 00:39:33.288]  It is, it's radical cultism.
[00:39:33.989 --> 00:39:35.250]  You know what real diversity looks like?
[00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.211]  It looks like InfoWars.
[00:39:37.431 --> 00:39:39.853]  Real diversity actually is diversity of thought.
[00:39:40.494 --> 00:39:41.915]  It's a diversity of opinions.
[00:39:42.055 --> 00:39:43.336]  It's the independent media.
[00:39:43.877 --> 00:39:45.918]  And it's diversity that's under assault by YouTube.
[00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:51.483]  Because they cannot handle a diversity of views, a diversity in the conversation.
[00:39:51.803 --> 00:39:55.887]  They cannot handle diverse analysis by independent thinkers.
[00:39:55.927 --> 00:39:58.269]  They demand absolute conformity.
[00:39:58.329 --> 00:39:59.070]  They demand
[00:40:00.017 --> 00:40:04.800]  That you conform to their system and do exactly what you're told, or you will be punished.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.661]  You will be economically sabotaged.
[00:40:06.681 --> 00:40:09.682]  You will be targeted and named by CNN to be destroyed.
[00:40:09.702 --> 00:40:12.524]  You will be named by the Washington Post to be destroyed.
[00:40:12.904 --> 00:40:15.025]  You will be named by the New York Times.
[00:40:15.585 --> 00:40:16.226]  Whatever it takes.
[00:40:16.266 --> 00:40:17.026]  They will come after you.
[00:40:17.066 --> 00:40:20.428]  They will lie about you, just like they're lying about Alex and lying about Infowars.
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:28.161]  I haven't been here for almost four years until a couple of weeks ago when I was a guest.
[00:40:28.481 --> 00:40:31.762]  I gotta tell you, this is a super professional operation.
[00:40:31.782 --> 00:40:32.962]  The people here are dedicated.
[00:40:33.962 --> 00:40:36.943]  This is the new infrastructure of truth media for America.
[00:40:36.963 --> 00:40:45.625]  I'm telling you, when CNN craters, when the fake news media finally loses its last viewer, which seems to be approaching every day,
[00:40:46.685 --> 00:40:49.606]  This operation right here is the new truth media for America.
[00:40:50.186 --> 00:40:50.626]  I see it.
[00:40:50.786 --> 00:41:00.789]  The studios, the technology, the know-how, the wisdom, the personnel here, the dedication to the truth, the dedication to actual diversity of views right here in the InfoWars studios.
[00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:04.970]  I mean, just the fact that Alex invites me on, he has no idea what I'm going to cover.
[00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.651]  He doesn't tell me what to cover.
[00:41:06.691 --> 00:41:08.691]  He doesn't say, you have to cover this and this and this.
[00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:14.813]  Alex knows that liberty-minded people are going to have slightly different views, but they all have the same passion.
[00:41:15.393 --> 00:41:16.414]  To protect this country.
[00:41:16.954 --> 00:41:18.495]  And I want to hear from you, by the way.
[00:41:18.515 --> 00:41:20.956]  I'm going to open up the phones in the second hour, okay?
[00:41:20.976 --> 00:41:22.317]  And we're going to take some calls.
[00:41:22.557 --> 00:41:24.758]  We're going to talk to Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit.
[00:41:24.838 --> 00:41:29.721]  We are probably going to talk to Gary Franchi if we can get him on the phone about censorship as well.
[00:41:30.241 --> 00:41:32.763]  More examples of censorship that are happening.
[00:41:33.383 --> 00:41:37.025]  Don't let the mainstream media trick you into thinking that this isn't happening.
[00:41:37.445 --> 00:41:38.786]  They're trying to say there is no purge.
[00:41:38.826 --> 00:41:39.026]  What?
[00:41:39.146 --> 00:41:39.646]  What purge?
[00:41:39.706 --> 00:41:40.707]  No one's being silenced.
[00:41:40.747 --> 00:41:42.088]  Meanwhile, we're all being silenced.
[00:41:42.742 --> 00:41:45.463]  You know, that's why the info war is so crucial.
[00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:47.663]  Your involvement is absolutely crucial.
[00:41:47.943 --> 00:41:49.184]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:41:49.784 --> 00:41:50.184]  All of us.
[00:41:50.304 --> 00:41:50.544]  All of us.
[00:41:50.584 --> 00:41:52.685]  We're independent operators in this space.
[00:41:52.765 --> 00:41:55.465]  We are here to fight for your rights.
[00:41:55.525 --> 00:41:57.586]  We are the bellwether individuals.
[00:41:57.626 --> 00:42:04.528]  When Alex Jones is under attack, or myself, the health ranger, when I'm under attack, what that means is literally, they're coming for you next.
[00:42:05.188 --> 00:42:06.329]  They're coming for you next.
[00:42:06.729 --> 00:42:19.562]  I can't tell you, since I was banned on Saturday by YouTube, terminated, the whole account, even my videos of rescuing donkeys and backyard chickens and ice crystals in the winter snow, all of it was just banned, terminated.
[00:42:20.242 --> 00:42:23.045]  I had so many people texting me and calling me and saying, you know Mike,
[00:42:24.318 --> 00:42:28.880]  We thought, for many years, we thought you were maybe exaggerating this threat about censorship.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.601]  Now we know you're right.
[00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:32.101]  You were absolutely right.
[00:42:32.181 --> 00:42:32.722]  It is coming.
[00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:33.942]  They are targeting you.
[00:42:34.442 --> 00:42:38.724]  You're one of the thought leaders in this space of liberty, and they want to silence your voice.
[00:42:39.204 --> 00:42:43.086]  Meanwhile, YouTube, you can find videos of people shooting each other and setting people on fire.
[00:42:43.126 --> 00:42:44.346]  That's okay with YouTube!
[00:42:44.767 --> 00:42:47.848]  But if you question the narrative, you will be targeted for termination.
[00:42:48.428 --> 00:42:50.689]  We'll be back with a special message from Alex Jones.
[00:42:50.709 --> 00:42:52.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.232]  Stay with us right after this break.
[00:43:04.941 --> 00:43:07.343]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewall.
[00:43:08.083 --> 00:43:10.185]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[00:43:10.785 --> 00:43:12.646]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[00:43:13.167 --> 00:43:19.271]  And we set out with beta-glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[00:43:19.291 --> 00:43:30.518]  We can even make claims about what this does to bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling or you're under stress or it's in the winter months.
[00:43:31.099 --> 00:43:33.360]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.661]  Wellmune is patented.
[00:43:35.701 --> 00:43:38.362]  And documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[00:43:39.282 --> 00:43:41.343]  And then you got the ancient stuff there as well.
[00:43:41.403 --> 00:43:46.065]  The organic olive leaf extract is what the Roman soldiers would take whenever they started getting sick.
[00:43:46.465 --> 00:43:49.886]  Just chopped full of all those key enzymes and vitamin C and so much more.
[00:43:49.906 --> 00:43:56.408]  Then it's got all the concentrated highest quality organic types of mushrooms that are documented for your body.
[00:43:56.448 --> 00:44:01.750]  And then concentrated citrus peel, orange peel, lemon peel, organic orange peel.
[00:44:03.277 --> 00:44:06.499]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[00:44:07.599 --> 00:44:15.002]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing, melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[00:44:15.343 --> 00:44:19.685]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[00:44:20.285 --> 00:44:26.628]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[00:44:28.058 --> 00:44:41.811]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things.
[00:44:42.111 --> 00:44:47.436]  And I checked with scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records.
[00:44:47.717 --> 00:44:50.279]  And then you get a sleep unlike other systems.
[00:44:51.641 --> 00:44:56.106]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[00:44:56.246 --> 00:44:57.828]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[00:44:57.848 --> 00:44:59.690]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:01.572]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[00:45:01.592 --> 00:45:04.535]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[00:45:05.816 --> 00:45:07.298]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[00:45:07.819 --> 00:45:09.420]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.463]  I only have to take one knockout.
[00:45:12.645 --> 00:45:15.787]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[00:45:15.827 --> 00:45:16.687]  This is insane.
[00:45:17.128 --> 00:45:18.068]  Wow, it's incredible.
[00:45:18.108 --> 00:45:20.130]  I've taken melatonin up by itself and it didn't help.
[00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:21.510]  Wow, this is incredible.
[00:45:21.791 --> 00:45:22.891]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[00:45:22.911 --> 00:45:27.894]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and in the wives' tales together to make you sleep.
[00:45:27.974 --> 00:45:28.915]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[00:45:29.575 --> 00:45:30.717]  And they're all game changers.
[00:45:30.757 --> 00:45:35.582]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[00:45:36.203 --> 00:45:39.827]  Our average review on InfoWareStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[00:45:44.335 --> 00:45:50.118]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them, going, we want to see it, it must be fake, blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:50.418 --> 00:45:51.938]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[00:45:53.219 --> 00:45:57.061]  So, they've had campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[00:45:57.101 --> 00:45:58.781]  I mean, they are just so angry.
[00:45:58.961 --> 00:46:01.082]  Where they test our stuff and test it and test it.
[00:46:01.122 --> 00:46:06.905]  California Labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[00:46:07.225 --> 00:46:13.251]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[00:46:13.551 --> 00:46:16.014]  But 60-something of our products are all California standard.
[00:46:16.034 --> 00:46:21.419]  But if you've got something that's got, I don't know, 10, 15 ingredients in it, and it's also a large serving like Caveman?
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:24.342]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup.
[00:46:25.043 --> 00:46:27.885]  Has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[00:46:28.005 --> 00:46:28.746]  It's just insane.
[00:46:28.766 --> 00:46:32.308]  And then we tested, tested, test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[00:46:32.328 --> 00:46:34.750]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.492]  But thank you for committing to get the great products.
[00:46:37.832 --> 00:46:39.393]  The books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[00:46:39.753 --> 00:46:42.375]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[00:46:42.395 --> 00:46:45.457]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films.
[00:46:46.077 --> 00:46:49.200]  And you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:52.342]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[00:46:52.682 --> 00:46:54.003]  It's called reap what you sow.
[00:46:55.939 --> 00:46:59.882]  That's available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:06.468 --> 00:47:10.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.556 --> 00:47:22.761]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:28.871 --> 00:47:42.998]  The American people and the people of the world are witnessing the globalist attempt to shut down free speech, not just in the US, but in any other country that still has pockets of basic freedom of expression left.
[00:47:43.738 --> 00:47:54.764]  And all I can say is, shame on the so-called leftist intelligentsia in the United States, in Europe, in the UK, in Australia, New Zealand, Canada.
[00:47:55.922 --> 00:48:06.227]  For doing like leftists do in every other country in history, since leftist ideology was founded by the Jacobins in the 1700s in France.
[00:48:07.688 --> 00:48:18.052]  And that has set up a total and absolute tyranny over everyone coming into power, claiming they want to bring liberty, but always bringing abject slavery and oppression.
[00:48:19.173 --> 00:48:21.074]  Now, that said,
[00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:24.981]  We have seen incredible things happen the last month.
[00:48:25.381 --> 00:48:32.623]  We've seen CNN try to ban and try to block the publishing of a book I'm writing and working on with Neil Strauss and openly admitting they are.
[00:48:33.003 --> 00:48:37.244]  We've seen CNN go after our sponsors, try to have our YouTube channel kicked off.
[00:48:37.504 --> 00:48:38.724]  They've been quarterbacking it.
[00:48:39.704 --> 00:48:47.686]  We've seen thousands and thousands of articles saying things about InfoWars that aren't true to set the precedent to ban us from the internet.
[00:48:49.548 --> 00:48:54.652]  And we see Apple now moving into Communist China, saying they're going to adopt their rules of censorship worldwide.
[00:48:55.292 --> 00:48:57.114]  These are very, very dangerous times.
[00:48:58.815 --> 00:49:03.098]  And now we've seen all these fake fraudulent EEOC complaints.
[00:49:03.658 --> 00:49:05.740]  We've seen all the fake lawsuits.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.500]  It goes on and on.
[00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:14.575]  With a new crowning one just yesterday filed by the reported creator of Pepe the Frog.
[00:49:15.936 --> 00:49:19.359]  This individual has sued Mike Cernovich, he's now suing me.
[00:49:19.859 --> 00:49:25.504]  Mike Cernovich created a meme with a frog dancing behind
[00:49:27.008 --> 00:49:28.508]  Hillary Clinton in one of the debates.
[00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:30.689]  Now that's total fair use.
[00:49:30.729 --> 00:49:31.909]  That's total freedom of speech.
[00:49:32.249 --> 00:49:33.030]  It's political speech.
[00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:34.630]  It's totally protected.
[00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.051]  He could have had Bugs Bunny dancing around behind him.
[00:49:38.091 --> 00:49:38.771]  It's free speech.
[00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:39.731]  It's political speech.
[00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:40.612]  I've talked to lawyers.
[00:49:40.632 --> 00:49:42.352]  I've been in the media 20-something years.
[00:49:42.572 --> 00:49:44.233]  I know what's going on.
[00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:45.133]  It's not real.
[00:49:46.093 --> 00:49:56.559]  But it doesn't matter because then they can just have big press releases with the lawsuits saying Pepe the Frog is not associated with white supremacists like Mike Cernovich and Alex Jones when we're not white supremacists.
[00:49:56.939 --> 00:49:58.320]  Anybody that knows us knows that.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.903]  But it's a way to run the headline everywhere and then mention the merchandise of the frog that the individual sells.
[00:50:05.037 --> 00:50:10.760]  I mean, does he think Warner Brothers is going to come after him for the dancing frog they've had since the 50s?
[00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:14.021]  Hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal.
[00:50:14.061 --> 00:50:15.002]  Remember that guy?
[00:50:15.302 --> 00:50:16.562]  Saturday morning cartoons, The Frog?
[00:50:16.582 --> 00:50:18.043]  Looks a lot like Pepe to me.
[00:50:18.903 --> 00:50:20.344]  The point is, oh Kermit the Frog!
[00:50:20.364 --> 00:50:22.445]  Did you steal it from Kermit?
[00:50:23.285 --> 00:50:26.347]  Reportedly the guy doesn't want Gab using the image of a frog.
[00:50:27.447 --> 00:50:28.089]  It's incredible.
[00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.474]  But that's what modern leftists do.
[00:50:30.534 --> 00:50:35.264]  They destroy free speech, they destroy communication, they destroy the free flow of ideas.
[00:50:36.798 --> 00:50:37.438]  It's what they do.
[00:50:37.558 --> 00:50:39.339]  So this individual went one further, though.
[00:50:39.359 --> 00:50:57.403]  He filed a lawsuit on us saying we create and sell a poster with Pepe the Frog on it, when what it is is a bunch of symbols and individuals from the 2016 campaign that an artist that sells his work online created, who contacted us and said, do you want to sell some of these?
[00:50:57.463 --> 00:50:59.124]  It's been an okay seller, not a big seller.
[00:50:59.744 --> 00:51:01.424]  In fact, we weren't planning to reorder it because it's from 2016.
[00:51:01.464 --> 00:51:01.864]  So the last
[00:51:04.125 --> 00:51:04.486]  We're good to go.
[00:51:22.967 --> 00:51:36.253]  You buy a thousand books from somebody and then somebody else later claims that you violated their trademark because they're saying that somebody plagiarized them and they're saying you're the plagiarer because you're selling somebody else's book.
[00:51:37.074 --> 00:51:49.139]  It hasn't even been adjudicated in court, you know, that indeed the guy that made these posters violated this other person's trademark because he put an image of a frog in a larger montage, which is totally protected.
[00:51:49.999 --> 00:51:50.720]  Hasn't even been proven.
[00:51:52.097 --> 00:52:01.581]  So then you go after me and put in the news that we are promoting Pepe as a white supremacist because we're the alt-right when we're the new right, by the way.
[00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:03.362]  We put that out two years ago.
[00:52:04.803 --> 00:52:06.043]  It's just next level garbage.
[00:52:06.063 --> 00:52:15.507]  But see, then folks know if they sue me, they'll get a bunch of PR and they'll get a bunch of coverage and they can put into the PR whatever disinformation and defamation they want.
[00:52:15.988 --> 00:52:16.548]  It's a formula.
[00:52:17.711 --> 00:52:19.912]  We figured this out earlier last year.
[00:52:20.633 --> 00:52:21.153]  So here's the thing.
[00:52:21.173 --> 00:52:22.234]  I'm not a litigious person.
[00:52:22.934 --> 00:52:27.077]  But I have to start suing people that file false complaints or do this.
[00:52:27.737 --> 00:52:36.463]  And so, when I get back from vacation, this individual's racked themselves up for another group to be put on the list for what we're launching in the next month.
[00:52:37.504 --> 00:52:38.745]  And I'm not a litigious person.
[00:52:39.485 --> 00:52:40.926]  But we've got to stand up for the free speech.
[00:52:40.986 --> 00:52:43.187]  We know the formula that's being used by the Democrats and their lawyers.
[00:52:43.568 --> 00:52:46.730]  And we've got to stand up because they're not going to stop as long as we lay down.
[00:52:47.625 --> 00:52:49.250]  This is just like authoritarians throughout history.
[00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:52.641]  King George, Hitler, the Soviet Union.
[00:52:52.681 --> 00:52:53.865]  This is really serious.
[00:52:55.391 --> 00:52:56.311]  And it's for all the marbles.
[00:52:56.671 --> 00:52:58.272]  And so, we have to take action.
[00:52:58.312 --> 00:52:59.232]  But that takes money.
[00:52:59.592 --> 00:53:01.173]  Not just to defend, but go on the offense.
[00:53:01.213 --> 00:53:07.574]  But once we've gotten rulings against a couple of these groups, and I've got the lawyers lined up, God, I've got them lined up around the block ready.
[00:53:07.594 --> 00:53:10.295]  A lot of top names ready to even go pro bono.
[00:53:10.575 --> 00:53:12.056]  But I've got to pay for flying people around.
[00:53:12.076 --> 00:53:13.176]  I've got to pay for transcripts.
[00:53:13.196 --> 00:53:16.737]  I've got to pay for, you know, the people that sit there and take the transcript.
[00:53:17.577 --> 00:53:18.377]  The court reporters.
[00:53:18.477 --> 00:53:20.018]  I mean, there's going to be court costs involved.
[00:53:20.358 --> 00:53:20.858]  So it won't be
[00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.499]  And think about Mike Adams, who's hosting today.
[00:53:50.754 --> 00:53:52.458]  Mike has sites as big as InfoWars.
[00:53:52.519 --> 00:53:54.945]  He's one of the top health guys in the world.
[00:53:55.586 --> 00:53:56.649]  His sites are in the top five.
[00:53:57.808 --> 00:53:58.788]  He's been sued.
[00:53:58.928 --> 00:53:59.649]  He's been attacked.
[00:53:59.689 --> 00:54:03.130]  He had his YouTube channel with nothing but health news on it banned last week.
[00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.210]  I haven't talked to him in a few days.
[00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.851]  I don't know if it's been restored, but that happened to thousands of people.
[00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:08.152]  That really happened.
[00:54:08.952 --> 00:54:16.494]  But right now, the Washington Post is running around saying none of that happened, and that we just made it all up, and that we're these great evil geniuses that know how to fool people.
[00:54:16.534 --> 00:54:18.135]  And boy, we hoaxed everybody.
[00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:19.916]  No, we have all the articles.
[00:54:19.956 --> 00:54:20.736]  We have all the statements.
[00:54:20.756 --> 00:54:21.236]  We have it all.
[00:54:21.276 --> 00:54:23.157]  We have our sites shut down over and over again.
[00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:26.218]  And then they turn them back on, and they go, oh, look, they're crying wolf.
[00:54:27.383 --> 00:54:28.264]  And this is why they're doing that.
[00:54:28.325 --> 00:54:28.765]  Here's the key.
[00:54:28.785 --> 00:54:29.566]  We'll go back to Mike Adams.
[00:54:30.468 --> 00:54:30.869]  Here's the key.
[00:54:32.659 --> 00:54:35.181]  Because it's tyrannical to shut people's speech down.
[00:54:35.501 --> 00:54:38.224]  Americans still have instincts and memories of freedom of speech.
[00:54:38.784 --> 00:54:42.047]  And it's so villainous that it turns whoever they're censoring into heroes.
[00:54:42.687 --> 00:54:44.449]  So that's why they want to have their take an idiot too.
[00:54:44.869 --> 00:54:47.831]  They think you have no memory, no attention span.
[00:54:48.192 --> 00:54:53.116]  And so they're going to sit there and try to ban everybody and then unban us until you get tired of hearing about it.
[00:54:53.136 --> 00:54:55.818]  And then the next time they ban us, everybody just moves along.
[00:54:56.499 --> 00:55:01.142]  They're counting on you getting tired and going away so they can steal your birthright and steal your speech.
[00:55:02.003 --> 00:55:02.984]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:55:03.605 --> 00:55:06.127]  We are going on the offense because the best defense is a good offense.
[00:55:06.668 --> 00:55:07.789]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:09.250]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:55:11.108 --> 00:55:12.529]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:15.251]  But without you, we cannot stand against this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:15.591 --> 00:55:16.853]  And so thank you all for your support.
[00:55:16.893 --> 00:55:17.713]  We're doing this together.
[00:55:18.154 --> 00:55:18.854]  We're gonna win.
[00:55:19.635 --> 00:55:21.276]  But it's very, very, very, very serious.
[00:55:21.817 --> 00:55:24.039]  And again, it's all totally anti-American.
[00:55:24.419 --> 00:55:25.480]  Attacks on free speech.
[00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:27.502]  To shut down their political opposition.
[00:55:27.522 --> 00:55:28.763]  To label us things we aren't.
[00:55:29.183 --> 00:55:29.784]  Nazis.
[00:55:29.844 --> 00:55:31.705]  And people that say, you know, kids died.
[00:55:31.765 --> 00:55:33.427]  And say that we're making fun of people.
[00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:34.588]  And just all these lies.
[00:55:34.608 --> 00:55:36.770]  And they want to delete our channel so we can't even respond.
[00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:38.610]  Alright, I'm going to stop breaking in here.
[00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:40.271]  Back to Mike Adams and the live transmission.
[00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:43.092]  Please spread the live video links wherever you're watching.
[00:55:43.392 --> 00:55:44.652]  Tell folks about our local affiliates.
[00:55:44.932 --> 00:55:45.532]  Support them.
[00:55:45.552 --> 00:55:46.313]  Become sponsors.
[00:55:46.333 --> 00:55:47.533]  This is an information war.
[00:55:48.213 --> 00:55:53.074]  And it takes people giving time and energy but also spreading articles and videos and financial support to win.
[00:55:53.735 --> 00:55:56.896]  But you're all behind us because you understand it's your futures as much as it is ours.
[00:55:57.176 --> 00:55:57.856]  We're in this together.
[00:55:58.116 --> 00:56:02.157]  So, please, I thank you all and I salute you for what you've done.
[00:56:02.217 --> 00:56:02.837]  Don't thank me.
[00:56:03.177 --> 00:56:05.138]  I'm thanking you because we're all in this together.
[00:56:06.573 --> 00:56:18.084]  What's unique about what Alex just described, I mean, this is a playbook that has happened throughout history, the totalitarian takeover attempt of all information sources, of taking away people's Second Amendment rights.
[00:56:18.124 --> 00:56:22.047]  Well, I mean, just firearms in other countries, you wouldn't call it Second Amendment in those other nations.
[00:56:22.448 --> 00:56:31.116]  But this idea of just taking over countries and installing totalitarian regimes, this is the radical left-wing communist Marxist playbook.
[00:56:31.616 --> 00:56:34.977]  But what's different today is that InfoWars is here.
[00:56:35.677 --> 00:56:38.678]  What's different is that people are willing to stand up and fight back.
[00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:43.220]  And with your support, that is effective.
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.161]  I mean, think about why are they targeting InfoWars?
[00:56:45.201 --> 00:56:47.642]  Because InfoWars is influential.
[00:56:48.322 --> 00:56:56.925]  You know, I was thinking just last night about there are multi-billionaires in Wall Street who don't have anywhere near the influence of Alex Jones.
[00:56:57.785 --> 00:57:02.311]  Alex Jones isn't a billionaire, but he's got the reach that is beyond multi-billionaires.
[00:57:02.871 --> 00:57:06.195]  But he needs your support in order to win this fight.
[00:57:06.976 --> 00:57:09.620]  Right now, store sales are the currency of freedom.
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:14.125]  So definitely go to Infowarsstore.com, definitely support this fight.
[00:57:14.566 --> 00:57:16.928]  We are lucky to have someone like Alex Jones standing up.
[00:57:17.549 --> 00:57:22.537]  With the courage to not be bullied, to not be lied about, to fight back and tell the truth.
[00:57:22.897 --> 00:57:27.925]  We are lucky to be part of this epic fight for human history, human civilization.
[00:57:28.085 --> 00:57:29.347]  Everything is at stake right now.
[00:57:29.827 --> 00:57:31.189]  So support this fight.
[00:57:31.290 --> 00:57:32.331]  Infowarstore.com
[00:57:33.052 --> 00:57:35.973]  And just support us by sharing all of our content.
[00:57:36.013 --> 00:57:36.814]  Myself as well.
[00:57:37.174 --> 00:57:38.214]  You know, I'm under attack.
[00:57:38.355 --> 00:57:39.215]  Alex is under attack.
[00:57:39.715 --> 00:57:40.896]  Jim Hoft is under attack.
[00:57:41.076 --> 00:57:42.777]  He's coming up in the next hour, by the way.
[00:57:42.817 --> 00:57:43.757]  We're all under attack.
[00:57:43.877 --> 00:57:44.457]  This is real.
[00:57:44.497 --> 00:57:45.198]  This is happening.
[00:57:45.678 --> 00:57:49.660]  Join the Info War and free our minds once and for all.
[00:57:54.341 --> 00:57:58.804]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[00:57:59.025 --> 00:58:03.728]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[00:58:04.329 --> 00:58:10.173]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[00:58:10.593 --> 00:58:23.183]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you have to absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[00:58:23.943 --> 00:58:32.649]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:34.551]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:35.992]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[00:58:36.012 --> 00:58:37.313]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[00:58:37.493 --> 00:58:38.674]  He doesn't drink anything.
[00:58:38.874 --> 00:58:40.354]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[00:58:40.875 --> 00:58:42.475]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[00:58:42.495 --> 00:58:44.276]  I only have to take one knockout.
[00:58:44.636 --> 00:58:47.237]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[00:58:47.277 --> 00:58:48.137]  This is insane.
[00:58:48.537 --> 00:58:50.178]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[00:58:50.418 --> 00:58:52.978]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[00:58:53.419 --> 00:58:54.939]  He says, this is totally free.
[00:58:54.979 --> 00:58:56.800]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:58.700]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[00:58:59.541 --> 00:59:05.462]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[00:59:05.722 --> 00:59:07.063]  All just moderate dose.
[00:59:08.592 --> 00:59:16.579]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[00:59:16.619 --> 00:59:18.942]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:19.002 --> 00:59:20.183]  But thank you for committing.
[00:59:24.236 --> 00:59:27.078]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[00:59:27.459 --> 00:59:30.061]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:34.844]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[00:59:35.304 --> 00:59:44.591]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[00:59:44.912 --> 00:59:46.233]  It's called reap what you sow.
[00:59:54.952 --> 00:59:59.062]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.604 --> 01:00:00.887]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:21.041 --> 01:00:26.131]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:30.509 --> 01:00:32.051]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:32.071 --> 01:00:34.433]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in today.
[01:00:34.473 --> 01:00:36.715]  We've got an exciting second hour coming up for you.
[01:00:37.015 --> 01:00:41.700]  We'll be interviewing Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit, who has also been targeted with extreme censorship.
[01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:51.250]  And in this short segment here, I want to bring your attention to the fact that everyone who is associated with InfoWars is being attacked and bullied and censored.
[01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:59.112]  And Paul Joseph Watson, of course, is one of those people now being bullied and attacked by CNN, which has become the fake news bully network, really.
[01:00:59.132 --> 01:01:02.093]  Maybe it should be BNN for Bully News Network.
[01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:05.334]  But Paul has a really good segment here.
[01:01:05.354 --> 01:01:07.554]  I want to give you a listen to a couple of minutes of it.
[01:01:07.594 --> 01:01:08.815]  So go ahead and roll that segment.
[01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:09.395]  We'll come back in.
[01:01:10.543 --> 01:01:13.885]  Yours truly has come under attack from CNN.
[01:01:13.925 --> 01:01:17.406]  They say, wait for it, they say I'm not mainstream.
[01:01:17.486 --> 01:01:22.929]  I appeared on Breitbart Radio and CNN's senior media reporter responded with this.
[01:01:22.949 --> 01:01:26.230]  I'm old enough to remember when Breitbart was trying to go mainstream.
[01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:27.391]  Guess they gave up.
[01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:30.332]  What exactly is mainstream these days?
[01:01:30.352 --> 01:01:37.715]  I mean, I know I come out with some edgy opinions from time to time, but I could never compete with CNN as saying something offensive.
[01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:45.618]  Then, there's heaping praise on somebody who represents a brutal dictatorship that incarcerates, tortures and executes hundreds of thousands of political dissidents.
[01:01:45.798 --> 01:01:46.838]  That's pretty edgy.
[01:01:46.938 --> 01:01:49.619]  Is that what constitutes being mainstream now?
[01:01:49.859 --> 01:01:54.721]  Genuflecting in front of a despotic regime that starves its own population to death?
[01:01:54.941 --> 01:01:56.142]  So, mainstream.
[01:01:56.182 --> 01:02:06.788]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but last time I checked, I don't think InfoWars or Breitbart were fawning over a country that has no independent media, functioning civil society or religious freedom.
[01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:07.888]  That's CNN's job.
[01:02:14.642 --> 01:02:15.743]  So mainstream.
[01:02:15.783 --> 01:02:18.805]  Maybe I'd be more mainstream if I encouraged cuckoldry.
[01:02:18.845 --> 01:02:20.767]  Apparently that's mainstream now too.
[01:02:20.807 --> 01:02:28.452]  But you know, when your primetime shows get less viewers than decades-old reruns of Yogi Bear cartoons, I guess you gotta spice it up a bit.
[01:02:28.472 --> 01:02:34.937]  Marlow went on to heap praise on one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists, describing him as a smart guy and someone who is wildly popular.
[01:02:35.077 --> 01:02:40.944]  The second half of that, I'm not going to argue with, but calling me one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists.
[01:02:41.044 --> 01:02:52.277]  Don't know if you've noticed, but in virtually every video I've made about big events for the past three years, I've debunked conspiracy theories here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
[01:02:52.357 --> 01:02:55.380]  Did I believe in some pretty out there conspiracy theories when I was younger?
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.081]  Let's bring it back in ten seconds.
[01:02:56.181 --> 01:02:57.462]  Yeah, then I grew up.
[01:02:57.542 --> 01:03:02.827]  But see, there's quite a big difference between my conspiracy theories and those pushed by CNN.
[01:03:02.967 --> 01:03:07.892]  I didn't help promote the conspiracy theory that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:03:07.912 --> 01:03:11.255]  A conspiracy theory that led to hundreds of thousands of dead in Iraq.
[01:03:12.236 --> 01:03:13.337]  That's Paul Joseph Watson there.
[01:03:13.357 --> 01:03:15.978]  I had to cut it off there because of the time limitations.
[01:03:15.998 --> 01:03:18.780]  If you see me looking up that way, I'm just looking at the show clock.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.782]  I don't have it all memorized here because I don't do this every day.
[01:03:22.122 --> 01:03:24.144]  But Paul Joseph Watson makes excellent points there.
[01:03:24.164 --> 01:03:26.685]  I really recommend that you watch that video at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:28.166 --> 01:03:51.966]  And the thing is, they can't stand someone like Paul Joseph Watson, or they can't stand someone like me or Jim Hoft, who we're going to talk to in just a few minutes here, because, I mean, right there, you know, Paul Joseph Watson, he's being a little satirical, he's funny, we all do a little bit of humor on the side, but when it comes down to it, we are the ones who have the logic, the reason, the historical facts that can counter the delusional nonsense of the left.
[01:03:52.086 --> 01:03:55.009]  The left wants you to believe in things that absolutely are not true.
[01:03:55.529 --> 01:04:03.331]  They want to make sure that things that are true, you think they're conspiracy theories, and then they want you to believe falsehoods as if they were facts.
[01:04:03.891 --> 01:04:07.572]  That's the twisting that they do, and so they cannot have dissenting voices.
[01:04:07.892 --> 01:04:11.974]  Like Paul Joseph Watson, who is, frankly, he's a YouTube superstar, right?
[01:04:12.394 --> 01:04:17.035]  I mean, he's got really millions of followers across all social media plus video platforms.
[01:04:17.475 --> 01:04:21.796]  He's a superstar for pointing out the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the left.
[01:04:22.276 --> 01:04:23.757]  And that's why Infowars is popular.
[01:04:24.457 --> 01:04:32.760]  Do you realize that InfoWars, if it were not suppressed, it would be by far the largest media organization in America?
[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:34.180]  No joke.
[01:04:34.641 --> 01:04:39.522]  And it's probably right up there, you know, in the top few right now, even with all the censorship that's going on.
[01:04:40.203 --> 01:04:42.623]  We're going to come back with Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:04:42.783 --> 01:04:44.264]  A fascinating interview coming right up.
[01:04:44.844 --> 01:04:47.085]  This is Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:47.165 --> 01:04:47.845]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:04:47.945 --> 01:04:48.425]  Stay with us.
[01:04:48.465 --> 01:04:49.706]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:05:03.956 --> 01:05:04.697]  I'm so excited.
[01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:14.323]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:05:14.923 --> 01:05:20.087]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:23.229]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:05:23.429 --> 01:05:32.195]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:05:34.296 --> 01:05:39.097]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:05:39.617 --> 01:05:42.378]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:05:42.518 --> 01:05:53.401]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:05:53.901 --> 01:05:55.181]  It is amazing!
[01:05:56.582 --> 01:06:01.543]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:06:04.312 --> 01:06:04.872]  We've got it.
[01:06:04.932 --> 01:06:11.356]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:11.436 --> 01:06:13.538]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:15.819 --> 01:06:21.442]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:26.281 --> 01:06:28.082]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:28.122 --> 01:06:31.844]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger of NaturalNews.com filling in today.
[01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:32.805]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:06:33.746 --> 01:06:41.991]  Just to tell you how popular InfoWars is, my phone has been blowing up with texts from everybody who knows me who's like, oh, you're hosting the Alex Jones Show!
[01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:49.014]  Yeah, thanks for watching, you know, but it just goes to show you how effective and how popular InfoWars has become.
[01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:52.896]  Now, coming up, we're going to be joined by Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:06:53.437 --> 01:07:02.461]  Jim has also been targeted by extreme censorship, and he's documented many of the cases of censorship of conservative websites, and he's got a lot to offer.
[01:07:02.621 --> 01:07:04.722]  We're going to be talking to him shortly, but first some headlines.
[01:07:05.363 --> 01:07:07.444]  NRA membership is surging now.
[01:07:08.104 --> 01:07:12.527]  In the wake of the gun control agenda push following the Parkland shooting.
[01:07:13.228 --> 01:07:15.049]  So, once again, it's backfiring.
[01:07:15.089 --> 01:07:19.912]  People are now recognizing that their guns are... There's an attempt to confiscate your guns.
[01:07:19.932 --> 01:07:21.793]  And that's another thing that the left-wing media says.
[01:07:21.853 --> 01:07:22.714]  Oh, that's not true.
[01:07:22.734 --> 01:07:23.354]  It's not real.
[01:07:23.394 --> 01:07:24.495]  We're not coming for your guns.
[01:07:24.535 --> 01:07:28.898]  Just like they're saying, oh, we're not censoring Alex Jones or Paul Joseph Watson or the Health Ranger.
[01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:29.899]  No, it's not even happening.
[01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:31.500]  Don't pay attention to that.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.641]  Yes, they're coming for your guns.
[01:07:34.121 --> 01:07:35.302]  That's their ultimate goal.
[01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:42.726]  They want to take the guns away from citizens because, you know, an individual with a firearm is a citizen, not a slave.
[01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:45.056]  And they know that, too.
[01:07:45.136 --> 01:07:46.397]  They want you to be a slave.
[01:07:47.077 --> 01:07:51.400]  North Korea says it's willing to discuss nuclear disarmament now.
[01:07:51.961 --> 01:07:52.761]  Yeah, really?
[01:07:53.062 --> 01:07:54.422]  I think that's fake.
[01:07:55.083 --> 01:07:57.585]  I think that's just posturing and positioning.
[01:07:58.285 --> 01:07:59.726]  And I posted this story last night.
[01:07:59.826 --> 01:08:04.630]  Trans men, transgender men, are now on track to eliminate all women from sports.
[01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:23.416]  Because all the women's sports are now being, you know, invaded by trans men who are, of course, physically, you know, they're either on male hormones, like testosterone, or they grew up as biological men and then they changed, you know, to women, they say they're women, and now they're beating women on the mats and winning high school championships.
[01:08:24.156 --> 01:08:24.937]  Absolutely insane.
[01:08:24.957 --> 01:08:26.458]  You're supposed to stand up and cheer.
[01:08:26.478 --> 01:08:31.822]  Oh, all you wonderful trans wrestlers beating women to a pulp on the mat.
[01:08:32.322 --> 01:08:32.863]  Wow.
[01:08:33.043 --> 01:08:34.544]  You are social justice warriors.
[01:08:34.624 --> 01:08:34.804]  Wow.
[01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:36.185]  Why can't you fight real men?
[01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:37.726]  You know, it's insane.
[01:08:38.226 --> 01:08:39.307]  But enough of that.
[01:08:40.068 --> 01:08:41.609]  If I keep talking about that, I'm going to lose it.
[01:08:42.209 --> 01:08:44.591]  Joining us now is Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:08:44.671 --> 01:08:47.753]  Jim, I want to welcome you to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:47.773 --> 01:08:48.674]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:08:49.675 --> 01:08:50.656]  Great to be with you, Mike.
[01:08:50.716 --> 01:08:52.277]  Congratulations on filling in.
[01:08:53.035 --> 01:08:57.377]  Well, it's an honor and a privilege to be here, but I gotta tell you, I'm a big fan of your work.
[01:08:57.397 --> 01:08:59.237]  I've been following your website very closely.
[01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:03.259]  You're very quick to get news out that is breakthrough news.
[01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:04.359]  How do you do it, man?
[01:09:04.379 --> 01:09:05.940]  Do you work like 16 hours a day?
[01:09:07.570 --> 01:09:13.716]  I have a pretty good staff, and we're pretty limited, and I also have some wonderful readers who send me tips, so that helps.
[01:09:13.876 --> 01:09:15.938]  But we do what we can, you know?
[01:09:15.958 --> 01:09:27.789]  Now, you've put out an article over the last couple of days that documents some of the big conservative sites and personalities who are being systematically targeted for censorship by the tech giants.
[01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:30.732]  Can you go over what you found a little bit?
[01:09:32.825 --> 01:09:33.826]  I'd be happy to.
[01:09:35.106 --> 01:09:37.748]  And of course I have Natural News on that list now.
[01:09:38.268 --> 01:09:38.688]  I see that.
[01:09:39.749 --> 01:09:41.669]  Which is tragic what happened to you guys.
[01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:45.011]  It's criminal, this activity that's going on.
[01:09:45.251 --> 01:09:45.851]  We know it is.
[01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:55.176]  In my case, and in several people in my situation, we actually advertised with Facebook, sent them tens of thousands of dollars to build our
[01:09:56.196 --> 01:10:01.419]  Gateway Pundit webpage on Facebook, and to build our fans.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:09.885]  And now, this past weekend, you know, since the election, Mike, Gateway Pundit was very successful during the election.
[01:10:10.385 --> 01:10:16.909]  Donald Trump went as InfoWars did, as we saw Breitbart got huge during the election.
[01:10:16.989 --> 01:10:17.489]  What happened?
[01:10:17.549 --> 01:10:21.312]  What are you named as the fourth most influential site, conservative site?
[01:10:22.112 --> 01:10:30.634]  Right, and this was a study, thank you Mike, that was actually a study done by Harvard, another one done by Columbia Journalism Review, a very respected journalism school.
[01:10:30.994 --> 01:10:37.636]  They came up with these numbers and found that Gary Pundit was the fourth most influential news source on the right during the election.
[01:10:38.036 --> 01:10:46.938]  And what this study told us too was that conservatives, as you know, as the InfoWars audience knows, conservatives, they left the media.
[01:10:47.478 --> 01:10:48.379]  At the last election.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:55.689]  They refused to be abused after decades of this, you know, awful reporting and berating by the liberal media.
[01:10:55.809 --> 01:11:01.977]  And they went to social media, they went to sites like yours, they went to sites like mine, they went to InfoWars to get the real news.
[01:11:02.598 --> 01:11:09.120]  And so what happened after this election was actually George Soros funded one of those studies I just mentioned.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:09.500]  Why?
[01:11:10.661 --> 01:11:18.924]  And they discovered that these social media sites, these websites were the ones leading the charge and helping Trump get elected.
[01:11:19.724 --> 01:11:25.786]  Of course it wasn't the national media and it wasn't the conservative, traditional conservative media because a lot of them were never Trumpers.
[01:11:26.246 --> 01:11:29.569]  But it seems like right now, Jim, I'm sorry to interrupt.
[01:11:29.589 --> 01:11:30.730]  We just lost your video.
[01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:31.351]  I guess it's back.
[01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:40.559]  But, you know, the question here is, aren't these tech giants admitting that they are tyrants in now this overt censorship?
[01:11:40.599 --> 01:11:41.760]  It used to be shadow banning.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:44.482]  It used to be covert, like a secret black box algorithm.
[01:11:44.843 --> 01:11:46.164]  Now it's right out in the open.
[01:11:46.184 --> 01:11:47.986]  They're just banning, terminating entire channels.
[01:11:48.346 --> 01:11:51.509]  Aren't they admitting now that they are tyrants and that they support tyranny?
[01:11:52.683 --> 01:11:53.284]  Absolutely.
[01:11:53.624 --> 01:11:54.365]  And it's their goal.
[01:11:54.445 --> 01:11:56.027]  It's their goal is to silence all of us.
[01:11:56.627 --> 01:11:58.829]  Because they know this is how people are getting their information.
[01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:02.693]  Conservatives wholeheartedly rejected the national media.
[01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:04.975]  Now they go to sites like ours.
[01:12:05.155 --> 01:12:08.619]  Our Facebook traffic has been declining ever since these studies came out.
[01:12:09.279 --> 01:12:17.121]  And our organic traffic continues to go up, but our Facebook traffic continues to decline, which is kind of a weird concept.
[01:12:17.181 --> 01:12:19.601]  It's only explained because they're targeting us.
[01:12:19.661 --> 01:12:30.403]  And then this weekend, with the latest algorithmic change, we saw that we were getting about as much traffic as a cakewalk at a country church bazaar.
[01:12:33.024 --> 01:12:39.669]  Yeah, so we're talking about 15 hits coming from our 640,000 Facebook fans.
[01:12:39.849 --> 01:12:47.093]  Here's what's stunning, I'm sorry to interrupt, there's a little bit of a delay, but if you weren't being effective, they wouldn't be targeting you for banning.
[01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:56.259]  I mean, think about this, the fact that your voice is so influential and so powerful, so many people go to TheGatewayPundit.com and find useful information there, just like InfoWars.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.941]  InfoWars is influential.
[01:12:58.761 --> 01:13:00.144]  It wakes people up.
[01:13:00.525 --> 01:13:02.127]  It's not like hypnotizing people.
[01:13:02.228 --> 01:13:05.814]  It's de-hypnotizing people from the lies of the mainstream media.
[01:13:05.894 --> 01:13:08.018]  Jim, you are a de-hypnotist as well.
[01:13:08.078 --> 01:13:09.902]  Welcome to the de-hypnosis club.
[01:13:10.785 --> 01:13:11.105]  Great.
[01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.146]  Glad to join it.
[01:13:12.286 --> 01:13:19.952]  And Mike, I gotta tell you, since I started talking about this at Gateway Pundit and putting up articles and really, you know, I'm freaked out about this.
[01:13:20.133 --> 01:13:25.797]  I don't think, I don't know if your audience, if the Americans really understand how serious this is.
[01:13:25.877 --> 01:13:27.238]  If they shut us down, that's it.
[01:13:27.418 --> 01:13:28.139]  It's getting over.
[01:13:28.539 --> 01:13:29.880]  This is where the fascists win.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.482]  This is where the communists take over.
[01:13:31.762 --> 01:13:38.808]  And that sounds very conspiracy-like and I don't tend to be that way, but I really believe that's what we're heading to if they succeed with this.
[01:13:39.128 --> 01:13:40.369]  And what's interesting too is,
[01:13:40.789 --> 01:13:51.514]  Since I started putting up these stories, I'm getting emails from all these large, conservative, pro-Trump websites and Facebook pages saying the same thing's happening to us.
[01:13:51.934 --> 01:13:56.616]  I had a discussion with one of these Facebook pages this morning.
[01:13:56.656 --> 01:13:57.616]  I'm not going to mention who.
[01:13:57.936 --> 01:14:01.458]  They were getting 32 million readers a week during the election.
[01:14:01.498 --> 01:14:04.179]  Now it's down to about 1 or 2 million a week.
[01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:05.459]  So this is what's happening.
[01:14:05.479 --> 01:14:06.580]  They're just shutting us down.
[01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.932]  Here's something else that I'm hearing, and I want to ask you if you're hearing the same thing.
[01:14:09.952 --> 01:14:11.493]  We've got about two minutes left in this segment.
[01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:24.761]  I want to hold you for the next segment as well, but many of these independent, smaller media websites or conservative sites, I think for a long time, a lot of them thought that Alex Jones was kind of out there when he was warning about the coming tyranny and the coming censorship.
[01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.022]  Well, now it's here.
[01:14:26.042 --> 01:14:29.844]  I mean, I'm hearing from people things like, oh my God, Alex Jones was right.
[01:14:30.084 --> 01:14:32.566]  You know, oh my God, all of a sudden, it's here.
[01:14:33.166 --> 01:14:34.627]  You know, he used to sound fringe.
[01:14:34.707 --> 01:14:36.188]  Now it's actually happening.
[01:14:36.228 --> 01:14:37.609]  Are you hearing anything like that?
[01:14:38.610 --> 01:14:39.271]  Absolutely.
[01:14:39.691 --> 01:14:43.073]  And you know, Alex did warn us all and he was absolutely correct.
[01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:48.097]  The sad thing is, Mike, is that where the hell is the Republican politicians?
[01:14:48.537 --> 01:14:58.445]  I went to Congress and I spoke to some of these people saying, you need to address this because they're going to lose all of their, all of the major media players that support Republican news.
[01:14:59.758 --> 01:15:01.359]  Well, where is Jeff Sessions, too?
[01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:05.622]  You know, it's like, what is he doing in the interest of the United States?
[01:15:06.403 --> 01:15:09.065]  Jim, we've got about a minute left in this segment.
[01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:10.746]  I'd like to hold you over to the next segment.
[01:15:11.026 --> 01:15:12.267]  You're doing amazing work.
[01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:16.830]  Your website, The Gateway Pundit, is putting out information that every American needs to see.
[01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:23.735]  And I believe that if you weren't being suppressed, and if we weren't being suppressed, we would be the dominant media in America.
[01:15:23.755 --> 01:15:25.036]  And that's exactly why they're suppressing us.
[01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:26.600]  Absolutely.
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:33.225]  And I get a joke out of this show on Sunday morning, Fox News, where they call it Media Buzz.
[01:15:33.706 --> 01:15:37.589]  And it's about all the traditional media, but it doesn't include anybody online.
[01:15:37.629 --> 01:15:40.972]  And that's where all the eyeballs are for conservatives these days.
[01:15:41.172 --> 01:15:41.733]  Exactly.
[01:15:42.393 --> 01:15:43.074]  Sorry to cut you off there.
[01:15:43.094 --> 01:15:43.935]  We're going to break, folks.
[01:15:44.575 --> 01:15:47.217]  The interview here is with Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit.
[01:15:47.518 --> 01:15:50.440]  My name is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:52.782]  We'll be back with more right after this break.
[01:15:52.802 --> 01:15:53.283]  Stay with us.
[01:16:02.515 --> 01:16:11.977]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[01:16:12.557 --> 01:16:17.218]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:16:17.878 --> 01:16:29.200]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[01:16:30.103 --> 01:16:43.489]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[01:16:44.309 --> 01:16:49.452]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[01:16:49.932 --> 01:16:51.373]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[01:16:52.233 --> 01:17:00.029]  A lot of protein, and you don't chew it properly sometimes, there's buildup, it can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis, you name it.
[01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:02.895]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[01:17:04.042 --> 01:17:11.507]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:23.996]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[01:17:24.336 --> 01:17:26.878]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[01:17:27.478 --> 01:17:31.481]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[01:17:31.882 --> 01:17:33.723]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:48.035]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[01:17:48.255 --> 01:17:52.038]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[01:17:52.398 --> 01:17:54.480]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.643]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[01:17:59.984 --> 01:18:02.866]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[01:18:03.306 --> 01:18:05.087]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:05.568 --> 01:18:15.875]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[01:18:17.016 --> 01:18:19.158]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[01:18:20.319 --> 01:18:33.126]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months building on this formula before we brought it to you.
[01:18:33.726 --> 01:18:42.911]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:46.181]  This is the total win-win.
[01:18:46.702 --> 01:18:52.406]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[01:18:52.967 --> 01:18:57.370]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[01:18:57.690 --> 01:19:03.195]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[01:19:03.695 --> 01:19:06.798]  Many probiotics out there don't even have
[01:19:07.358 --> 01:19:07.739]  Thank you.
[01:19:25.379 --> 01:19:28.920]  Two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:34.941]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[01:19:35.421 --> 01:19:40.083]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[01:19:40.703 --> 01:19:49.725]  Whether it's Floral Life, Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[01:19:50.839 --> 01:19:54.540]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[01:19:54.740 --> 01:20:02.563]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:20:06.924 --> 01:20:09.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.324 --> 01:20:28.469]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:30.471]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:48.004 --> 01:20:49.564]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:49.584 --> 01:20:50.564]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:20:50.624 --> 01:20:53.725]  Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex.
[01:20:53.965 --> 01:21:03.507]  I have been the subject of extreme censorship, just like Alex and Paul Joseph Watson and many conservative channels, just like Jim Hoft, our guest for this segment.
[01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:14.949]  He's with TheGatewayPundit.com and he has been documenting the systematic censorship of conservative websites, many that he has listed on his website and many that he hasn't been able to name because those
[01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:21.912]  Publishers are too freaked out, too afraid, let's say, to even allow their names to be mentioned.
[01:21:22.192 --> 01:21:26.894]  And during the break, Jim was telling me that he is freaked out about what this means for America.
[01:21:27.114 --> 01:21:35.237]  If they're silencing half the country, half the conversation, what does this mean for the future sustainability of a democracy or a republic?
[01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:37.677]  So, Jim, welcome back to the show.
[01:21:37.778 --> 01:21:38.938]  I appreciate you joining us today.
[01:21:39.558 --> 01:21:40.578]  And that's the question.
[01:21:40.598 --> 01:21:41.679]  That's the opening question for you.
[01:21:41.759 --> 01:21:43.199]  What does this mean for our democracy?
[01:21:43.259 --> 01:21:44.600]  Well, our republic, I like to say.
[01:21:45.641 --> 01:22:02.597]  Yeah, I think it's pretty evident what's going to happen, and I think that the Republican lawmakers better wake up, because when we're gone, when InfoWars is gone, when Natural News is gone, when all of these places are gone, who's going to be there to carry the message, you know?
[01:22:02.977 --> 01:22:07.041]  Who's going to be there to correct the record when the media puts up this
[01:22:07.461 --> 01:22:11.584]  Complete bias that they throw up every day and hurl at the American people.
[01:22:11.824 --> 01:22:21.230]  There won't be any, and so it's unfortunate that we don't have an enlightened political party that would represent us, but that isn't the fact today.
[01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:25.113]  They're just, I don't understand what they put their attention on.
[01:22:25.133 --> 01:22:28.355]  I don't understand what they do with their time.
[01:22:28.375 --> 01:22:30.957]  I don't understand what their staff is doing all day.
[01:22:30.977 --> 01:22:35.280]  If they don't see what's happening with the people who are supporting them,
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:44.983]  And that we're being picked off one at a time by these social media giants to silence us and quash our voice forever.
[01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:56.206]  Well, what would you say, though, some of the people who are defending this censorship, if you can believe that, it's, you know, tyrannical leftists, that pretty much all leftists at this point are sort of totalitarians at heart.
[01:22:56.286 --> 01:22:58.267]  It's just starting to come out now and be expressed.
[01:22:58.567 --> 01:23:00.928]  But they say that, oh, these are private corporations.
[01:23:00.968 --> 01:23:02.288]  They can censor anyone they want.
[01:23:02.528 --> 01:23:04.669]  What's your response to an accusation like that?
[01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:12.555]  Yeah, I love that one line that James Woods, the actor, used to, he tweeted this out a few times.
[01:23:13.055 --> 01:23:15.837]  It was, scratch a liberal, find a Marxist.
[01:23:16.398 --> 01:23:19.821]  And of course, that's what we have today in America.
[01:23:19.841 --> 01:23:27.307]  This party on the left stands for nothing except complete control over the population and these failed socialist policies.
[01:23:27.827 --> 01:23:32.391]  And of course, their, you know, social agitation that goes on constantly.
[01:23:33.021 --> 01:23:40.585]  I think, I just think what's happening is just, you know, it's going to destroy this country.
[01:23:41.245 --> 01:23:49.630]  And, you know, another example I wanted to throw in here was today, just before I came on the air with you, we get this email from Facebook.
[01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:53.372]  Now, they shut down our traffic, so this is really just rubbing salt in our wounds.
[01:23:53.712 --> 01:23:58.435]  But what they said was that this article we put up like two weeks ago, it went viral.
[01:23:58.455 --> 01:23:58.955]  They're saying,
[01:23:59.395 --> 01:24:05.697]  This was fake news and we're going to take this, you know, we're not going to let people read this and we're going to redirect them.
[01:24:05.717 --> 01:24:07.017]  They're actually, this is what they're doing.
[01:24:07.477 --> 01:24:15.399]  They're redirecting people from Gateway Pundit and saying, go read this article instead by the AP, which is unbelievable.
[01:24:15.959 --> 01:24:23.301]  So they're taking our story, they're saying it's false, and by the way, this was a private letter we got from one of the fathers from Parkland.
[01:24:23.781 --> 01:24:24.041]  Right?
[01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:28.082]  They have no evidence that this is, you know, fake news.
[01:24:28.442 --> 01:24:30.823]  In fact, we protected this father.
[01:24:30.843 --> 01:24:32.023]  We looked into his family.
[01:24:32.363 --> 01:24:34.184]  What he said was absolutely correct.
[01:24:34.724 --> 01:24:42.266]  And they're telling their audience that the AP says this is not legitimate news and that they should go read the AP article instead.
[01:24:42.286 --> 01:24:51.869]  They're literally hijacking your traffic and pushing it over to fake news, Associated Press in this case, but I guess they could choose somewhere else they want to push it to, like CNN.
[01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:54.211]  Absolutely.
[01:24:54.491 --> 01:24:56.291]  It's so out of control.
[01:24:56.331 --> 01:25:02.274]  You know, you also mentioned during the break that there's an upcoming march, you know, the anti-gun, the gun control march.
[01:25:02.914 --> 01:25:12.378]  And you said something that really got my attention, that they are recruiting and indoctrinating school children now as young as nine years old to go out and join this march.
[01:25:12.438 --> 01:25:13.138]  Is that correct?
[01:25:14.358 --> 01:25:14.618]  Right.
[01:25:15.339 --> 01:25:18.800]  They're organizing the Social Justice Warriors of Tomorrow.
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:20.881]  I got a letter from a parent.
[01:25:21.585 --> 01:25:21.906]  I don't
[01:25:33.803 --> 01:25:44.335]  To go march in this anti-gun rally next week, which is on the 14th, and we know all the leftist, radical organizations that are behind this march.
[01:25:44.655 --> 01:25:51.443]  And so they're asking parents to allow their 9-year-olds to participate in this social justice warrior
[01:25:52.183 --> 01:25:55.626]  Um, you know, an event that's happening across the country next week.
[01:25:56.046 --> 01:25:56.967]  It's unbelievable.
[01:25:56.987 --> 01:26:01.871]  The indoctrination, I mean, that honestly reminds me of, like, Hitler Youth indoctrination.
[01:26:02.711 --> 01:26:03.352]  It's fascist.
[01:26:04.152 --> 01:26:05.654]  It is, it's out of control.
[01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:17.522]  And, you know, I got a bigger just hint of a warning there, and I'm saying this, not you, I don't want this to come back on you, but, you know, if someone wanted to pull off a false flag shooting to really try to take away the guns,
[01:26:18.323 --> 01:26:27.209]  If they had children at the march and then they actually carried out a shooting of those children, and they always use children, you know, to invoke emotion and get a reaction.
[01:26:27.529 --> 01:26:30.851]  It's like they're setting up a perfect storm for a false flag event.
[01:26:30.892 --> 01:26:32.212]  I mean, I hope it never happens.
[01:26:32.573 --> 01:26:35.154]  I'm not predicting it as it's gonna happen.
[01:26:35.174 --> 01:26:42.059]  I'm just saying, if they wanted to, it's like a perfect situation for them to murder those children to take our guns.
[01:26:42.099 --> 01:26:42.819]  It's sick.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.821]  I know it's like, do they even do this?
[01:26:45.161 --> 01:26:46.402]  Yeah, they're sick at this point.
[01:26:46.422 --> 01:26:47.763]  They will do anything to take our liberty.
[01:26:49.305 --> 01:26:50.826]  Yeah, I wouldn't put it past him.
[01:26:50.886 --> 01:26:57.767]  I mean, we saw the reaction in Parkland, where they ignored this guy on social media, even though he was using his own name.
[01:26:57.847 --> 01:27:02.869]  They lied about it then, saying that they tried to look him up, which they didn't, because his name was right there.
[01:27:02.889 --> 01:27:07.650]  He was also, he used his real name on Instagram, too, as we reported at Gateway Pundit.
[01:27:08.035 --> 01:27:11.199]  So there was no investigation of this guy when he was throwing these threats out there.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.244]  No investigation of the 40 calls to his house.
[01:27:14.784 --> 01:27:15.886]  They didn't link anything.
[01:27:15.946 --> 01:27:18.710]  The school did tell this kid not to bring a backpack to school.
[01:27:18.730 --> 01:27:20.552]  That's how scared they were of this nutcase.
[01:27:22.208 --> 01:27:30.634]  And then they tell the cops to wait outside, you know, the deputies to wait outside as children are getting shot inside.
[01:27:31.134 --> 01:27:32.135]  What the hell is that?
[01:27:32.535 --> 01:27:38.499]  And now they want to take our guns because of these missteps by the deep state and the local
[01:27:39.519 --> 01:27:41.341]  Police community, it's outrageous.
[01:27:41.641 --> 01:27:42.262]  It's unreal.
[01:27:42.342 --> 01:27:45.424]  I gotta say, Jim, first of all, thank you for joining us here today.
[01:27:45.444 --> 01:27:49.307]  I want to encourage everyone, you know, check your website, thegatewaypundit.com.
[01:27:49.807 --> 01:27:50.908]  You do great work.
[01:27:51.609 --> 01:27:54.751]  I've really been tracking your website over the last six months.
[01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:57.674]  It's the first thing I check every morning because you're breaking news early.
[01:27:58.454 --> 01:28:08.683]  And often all throughout the day and between Matt Drudge and your site and InfoWars and you know all the other independent media sites it is it's a whirlwind of information.
[01:28:09.124 --> 01:28:12.427]  Is there anything else you want to leave us with as we close out the segment here?
[01:28:13.611 --> 01:28:18.574]  You know, I just think it's tragic what I'm witnessing today in America.
[01:28:18.594 --> 01:28:21.175]  I see how you're getting attacked.
[01:28:21.235 --> 01:28:23.136]  I see how Alex Jones is getting attacked.
[01:28:23.176 --> 01:28:26.738]  Paul Joseph Watson, who is phenomenal, how he's getting attacked.
[01:28:27.299 --> 01:28:29.860]  And I just think it's tragic that this is going on in the West.
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:35.323]  And it's time for the people to stand up before there won't be anybody left to carry our message.
[01:28:36.023 --> 01:28:38.265]  And the attacks only make us stronger, don't they, Jim?
[01:28:39.028 --> 01:28:40.729]  I mean, we're getting stronger.
[01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:47.875]  I mean, we are galvanized to action to protect the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, this republic, our liberty.
[01:28:48.615 --> 01:28:50.397]  Join us, stay with us here after this break.
[01:28:50.437 --> 01:28:51.858]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:51.878 --> 01:28:53.759]  And thank you, Jim Hoff from the Gateway Pundit.
[01:28:53.859 --> 01:28:54.740]  A pleasure talking with you.
[01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:07.087]  Support good oral health with our one-of-a-kind super blue fluoride free products.

[01:29:31.849 --> 01:29:41.999]  Instead of containing fluoride, our Super Blue line is loaded with the good halogen iodine and an array of other beneficial compounds that have been hand-selected for their oral health benefits.
[01:29:42.159 --> 01:29:48.646]  Our Super Blue Fluoride-Free Mouthwash and Toothpaste are the first and only to contain all of these natural ingredients.
[01:29:49.026 --> 01:29:51.649]  Xylitol, Nano Silver, and Iodine.

[01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:14.465]  My good friend, I've gotten to know him really well over the years, knew his dad before I even knew him, Mike Norris is here with us in the studio.
[01:30:14.485 --> 01:30:17.428]  He's got a new film we'll talk about in the next segment, The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:30:17.808 --> 01:30:28.077]  Hollywood free, made in Texas, funded in Texas, and then of course the big films you produced for Hollywood, but also for cable television, Lifetime, Hallmark, you name it.
[01:30:28.677 --> 01:30:33.241]  Very successful, but now you've got The Crossroads of Hunter Wilde sitting back, the state of the world,
[01:30:33.901 --> 01:30:40.206]  I mean, I don't think we've turned the tide yet, but man, there was really nobody fighting back except a few folks before.
[01:30:40.547 --> 01:30:41.968]  The world has really changed.
[01:30:42.248 --> 01:30:45.951]  What period in time do you think we're in right now, Mike Norris?
[01:30:46.692 --> 01:30:47.953]  We're in the greatest time ever.
[01:30:48.733 --> 01:30:50.495]  I mean, we're making America great again.
[01:30:50.855 --> 01:30:55.198]  We've got great people around just speaking the truth everywhere.
[01:30:55.599 --> 01:30:57.320]  And I think the elites are going down.
[01:30:57.861 --> 01:31:00.663]  And I think this is such an exciting time.
[01:31:00.783 --> 01:31:01.784]  I'm happy to be alive.
[01:31:01.824 --> 01:31:02.945]  I'm proud to witness it.
[01:31:04.326 --> 01:31:05.427]  Making America great again.
[01:31:05.728 --> 01:31:09.552]  You've made films about the Globalist, the New World Order, you've been speaking about it for decades, fighting it.
[01:31:11.093 --> 01:31:14.177]  This is super positive, but they are striking back.
[01:31:14.517 --> 01:31:15.378]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:31:15.418 --> 01:31:20.764]  And the thing with this film, Crossroads of Hunter Wilde, after we did America, and that was such a large film, it took
[01:31:21.224 --> 01:31:22.486]  A long time, big budget.
[01:31:22.846 --> 01:31:39.285]  What I wanted to do was kind of strip everything down and really get into a story about what would the world look like if civil war actually took place, everybody factioned up, and a spiritual warfare broke out within our country.
[01:31:39.725 --> 01:31:40.466]  That's already happened.
[01:31:40.686 --> 01:31:41.906]  It's starting, it's starting.
[01:31:41.946 --> 01:31:49.871]  But you know, a lot of it had to do with the way you were talking years ago about the demonic entities of not only Hollywood, but the government, everything.
[01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:52.693]  Hey, if there's a God, there's a devil.
[01:31:53.253 --> 01:31:56.395]  And the devil is after believers all over the country.
[01:31:56.535 --> 01:32:02.019]  And we've got to be prepared and we've got to be ready to fight for our faith, for our country, for everything.
[01:32:02.299 --> 01:32:04.400]  But that's the thing with Crossroads of Hunter Wilde.
[01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:08.543]  It deals with the spiritual battle that can take place within us.
[01:32:08.823 --> 01:32:14.026]  And we've got all the public statements by Antifa about rising up, taking over, triggering something for martial law.
[01:32:14.807 --> 01:32:16.347]  This is really what they're pushing.
[01:32:16.387 --> 01:32:19.669]  So a very, very timely, timely film.
[01:32:20.450 --> 01:32:25.833]  When you see them failing, though, on every front, when you see Soros starting to fail, what do you think they're going to do next?
[01:32:25.853 --> 01:32:27.234]  They're not going to give up.
[01:32:27.314 --> 01:32:29.215]  You know, Alex, I wish I knew.
[01:32:29.235 --> 01:32:31.496]  I really wish I knew what they were going to do.
[01:32:31.516 --> 01:32:32.317]  They're not going to give up.
[01:32:33.878 --> 01:32:45.747]  I'm a little nervous to see, you know, what the millennials, so to say, you know, I think they're so brainwashed that they will follow anything without any thought to it.
[01:32:46.087 --> 01:32:51.451]  So, a little curious to see what happens with them, but you know what?
[01:32:51.531 --> 01:32:53.953]  We're going to kick their butts everywhere.
[01:32:54.353 --> 01:32:55.674]  We're going to beat them, Alex.
[01:32:55.954 --> 01:32:58.016]  We are going to win this battle.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.062]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:31.815 --> 01:33:37.813]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:40.692 --> 01:33:42.353]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:42.834 --> 01:33:45.436]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:46.657 --> 01:33:50.579]  Mike Adams here, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.842]  This is the tip of the spear of liberty for America.
[01:33:54.122 --> 01:33:55.863]  We are all under attack.
[01:33:56.204 --> 01:33:59.206]  Our free speech is under serious assault today.
[01:33:59.226 --> 01:34:03.829]  I'm going to cover a few headlines here, what's going on, just to bring you up to speed on the latest news.
[01:34:04.330 --> 01:34:09.314]  And then in the third hour, don't miss it, we're covering how the abortion industry
[01:34:11.995 --> 01:34:17.298]  It's almost too gross, but I'm going to try to say this.
[01:34:18.418 --> 01:34:32.165]  They use garbage disposals to dump fetuses down the drains that go into the bio-sludge that are then spread on crops as fertilizer to grow food for your consumption.
[01:34:32.245 --> 01:34:37.528]  So, you think about the food that's being fed to our school children in the public school system, it's actually grown
[01:34:38.448 --> 01:34:40.589]  In literally dead baby fertilizer.
[01:34:40.609 --> 01:34:46.152]  So that's... It's almost too sick to discuss, but we have to tell the truth about this.
[01:34:46.192 --> 01:34:48.734]  So that's coming up in the third hour here.
[01:34:49.514 --> 01:34:52.956]  Happening today... It's impossible to segue from something like that.
[01:34:52.996 --> 01:34:53.616]  I don't know what to say.
[01:34:53.636 --> 01:34:54.277]  It's just sick.
[01:34:54.737 --> 01:34:56.338]  Actually, let me just say this right now.
[01:34:57.523 --> 01:35:00.225]  The left is evil, pure evil.
[01:35:00.725 --> 01:35:05.408]  They are truly demonic in the level of evil that they are now exerting.
[01:35:05.488 --> 01:35:19.438]  They are, if you think about it, the people that they're trying to censor and shut down and bully are the people who are protecting life, people who are protecting liberty, protecting free speech, protecting the right of self-defense, which is a divine right, by the way.
[01:35:19.898 --> 01:35:24.502]  If you look out across nature, you know I'm a food scientist and I'm a natural health expert.
[01:35:25.302 --> 01:35:30.825]  All across nature, what I see is self-defense mechanisms in every animal, every plant.
[01:35:31.406 --> 01:35:35.348]  Did you know, for example, that dandelions have a self-defense mechanism?
[01:35:36.343 --> 01:35:44.989]  They actually emit a chemical that defends them against neighboring plants, and so the dandelion can grow without being invaded.
[01:35:45.009 --> 01:35:47.150]  I mean, dandelions have self-defense weapons.
[01:35:47.991 --> 01:35:48.831]  It's absolutely true.
[01:35:48.851 --> 01:35:49.472]  This is botany.
[01:35:49.512 --> 01:35:50.692]  This is basic science.
[01:35:51.393 --> 01:36:01.940]  And yet the left, the tyrannical, deranged left, is trying to tell us that humans, obviously, hopefully a higher life form than dandelions, we don't have the right to self-defense?
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:02.780]  What, we have to call 911?
[01:36:04.321 --> 01:36:12.106]  And wait for the same government people to show up and save us who refused to walk into that building in Parkland, Florida?
[01:36:12.367 --> 01:36:16.770]  They refused, they stood outside, they stood down while children were being shot up.
[01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:18.671]  These people are supposed to save us?
[01:36:19.111 --> 01:36:28.478]  We're supposed to give up our self-defense rights, a divine right reflected throughout nature, and trust a failed, incompetent government system?
[01:36:29.258 --> 01:36:34.204]  To protect us, even knowing that that government is most likely to be weaponized against us?
[01:36:34.845 --> 01:36:37.789]  Especially under a Democrat regime?
[01:36:37.809 --> 01:36:41.253]  I mean, if Hillary Clinton had been president, oh my god.
[01:36:42.408 --> 01:36:48.116]  I honestly think if Hillary Clinton had won, Alex Jones would be in jail right this minute.
[01:36:48.837 --> 01:36:51.240]  I think that InfoWars would have been raided at gunpoint.
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:55.305]  I think they would have arrested me or shut me down or seized my domain name.
[01:36:57.288 --> 01:36:59.250]  All of this would have happened if Hillary had won.
[01:37:00.819 --> 01:37:02.180]  Count your blessings right now.
[01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:11.464]  Thank God that we the people took a stand and that Hillary Clinton was defeated in that election, which means we have a fighting chance.
[01:37:12.064 --> 01:37:12.884]  We have a chance.
[01:37:12.944 --> 01:37:18.246]  Maybe one of the most epic opportunities in the history of human civilization.
[01:37:18.707 --> 01:37:20.267]  Right now, a chance to fight back.
[01:37:21.008 --> 01:37:24.929]  The currency of that fight, frankly, is revenue.
[01:37:27.159 --> 01:37:28.740]  Definitely support the InfoWars store.
[01:37:29.561 --> 01:37:30.261]  The sale is going on.
[01:37:30.281 --> 01:37:31.922]  There's free shipping right now across the country.
[01:37:31.963 --> 01:37:33.303]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:33.684 --> 01:37:35.645]  This is how you power liberty.
[01:37:35.745 --> 01:37:38.988]  This is how InfoWars funds its operation predominantly.
[01:37:39.008 --> 01:37:50.356]  You know, I think CNN is out there lying and saying that InfoWars was funded by a few advertisers that they're trying to now stalk and bully into pulling their ads, as Alex explained in the first hour.
[01:37:50.996 --> 01:37:58.343]  You know, some advertisers would put a few ads on the YouTube channel for InfoWars and then pull them off so they could say they pulled their ads.
[01:37:59.004 --> 01:38:02.488]  And I think one advertiser was like, what, $169 that they spent or something?
[01:38:03.068 --> 01:38:03.629]  It's a joke!
[01:38:04.169 --> 01:38:07.332]  It's essentially a lie to claim that that funds this operation.
[01:38:07.593 --> 01:38:11.056]  What really funds this operation is your support, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:38:11.977 --> 01:38:12.478]  And by the way,
[01:38:13.763 --> 01:38:21.826]  I have a unique perspective, you know, I'm a business owner, I've got my own operation, my own publishing, my own, you know, superfood manufacturing and all that.
[01:38:22.386 --> 01:38:23.906]  I understand how hard it is to do this.
[01:38:24.346 --> 01:38:35.050]  I understand, I know the compliance attorney for InfoWars, and he is keeping this operation compliant, label compliance, you know, quality control compliance, all these things.
[01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:38.291]  It is an amazing operation, but it needs your support.
[01:38:38.831 --> 01:38:41.212]  The other thing is, if you think about the deep state,
[01:38:41.852 --> 01:38:46.854]  The factions that are waging war against free speech, they can print money.
[01:38:47.354 --> 01:38:48.875]  They can create money from nothing.
[01:38:48.895 --> 01:38:49.935]  They've got central banks.
[01:38:50.315 --> 01:38:51.576]  They've got money floating around.
[01:38:51.596 --> 01:38:53.657]  They've got billions of dollars in offshore accounts.
[01:38:53.977 --> 01:38:57.999]  Anytime they want, they can bring, you know, another couple of million dollars in to do whatever they want.
[01:38:58.359 --> 01:39:02.220]  Hire a mob, rent a mob, a George Soros staged fake...
[01:39:04.781 --> 01:39:06.242]  I mean, even the Russians, right?
[01:39:06.302 --> 01:39:13.124]  Even the Russians had, like, an anti-Trump protest in New York City that Michael Moore was part of, you know, unwittingly.
[01:39:13.164 --> 01:39:14.865]  He didn't know it was by the Russians.
[01:39:14.885 --> 01:39:18.806]  But all these organizations can come up with money just like that.
[01:39:19.726 --> 01:39:22.547]  The deep state, the globalists, the people that are trying to take away your freedom.
[01:39:22.867 --> 01:39:23.948]  They've got endless money.
[01:39:24.778 --> 01:39:28.781]  Well, InfoWars doesn't have, you know, a printing press that they can just print money.
[01:39:28.821 --> 01:39:31.083]  There's not a central bank hiding in the back room here.
[01:39:31.564 --> 01:39:32.284]  They depend on you.
[01:39:32.865 --> 01:39:33.805]  They depend on your support.
[01:39:33.825 --> 01:39:35.567]  So InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:39:36.388 --> 01:39:38.549]  Let me go over a couple more headlines of things that are happening right now.
[01:39:38.589 --> 01:39:44.854]  CNN is reporting that they're sending a reporter to go visit some hookers in Thailand
[01:39:46.482 --> 01:39:49.323]  At least one hooker that claims to have dirt on Trump.
[01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:53.285]  Imagine their surprise when they find out she's a ladyboy.
[01:39:53.945 --> 01:39:56.086]  So that's going to be an interesting segment.
[01:39:56.807 --> 01:40:01.488]  After stalking elderly women in their front yards, they're going to go visit ladyboy prostitutes in Thailand.
[01:40:01.508 --> 01:40:04.510]  That's CNN for you right there, the bully news network.
[01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:08.591]  A new study claims bacon is linked to causing cancer.
[01:40:08.851 --> 01:40:14.334]  The reason I'm mentioning this is because I know it's actually from the sodium nitrite in processed bacon.
[01:40:15.334 --> 01:40:20.537]  Real, fresh meat does not cause cancer unless you add the chemicals to it.
[01:40:20.897 --> 01:40:22.238]  I wanted to get that out there on the record.
[01:40:23.058 --> 01:40:24.839]  Bacon itself does not cause cancer.
[01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:27.280]  It's the nitrites that are added to it.
[01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:31.182]  Sodium nitrite causes colorectal cancer, causes pancreatic cancer.
[01:40:31.522 --> 01:40:34.124]  I've done extensive reporting on this in the past.
[01:40:34.964 --> 01:40:44.194]  Also, from one of my websites, science.news, once begun, this is the headline, there would be severe consequences to stopping climate intervention and geoengineering.
[01:40:44.755 --> 01:40:50.601]  Do you remember just two years ago, if you mentioned geoengineering, you were called a conspiracy theorist.
[01:40:50.661 --> 01:40:51.022]  What?
[01:40:51.362 --> 01:40:53.204]  No one's changing the climate?
[01:40:53.284 --> 01:40:55.907]  No, there's no chemtrails, there's no geoengineering.
[01:40:56.247 --> 01:40:56.447]  Now?
[01:40:57.108 --> 01:41:02.470]  Geoengineering is mainstream science talking about how they're going to save the planet from climate change.
[01:41:02.530 --> 01:41:03.951]  Oh yeah, we need geoengineering.
[01:41:03.971 --> 01:41:04.651]  This is their argument now.
[01:41:05.031 --> 01:41:06.152]  We need geoengineering.
[01:41:06.632 --> 01:41:12.134]  But now they're warning, once we start it, we can't stop it because that might be catastrophic.
[01:41:12.574 --> 01:41:12.854]  What?
[01:41:13.615 --> 01:41:14.495]  What are they talking about?
[01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:18.110]  This is like, oh, we can't stop the chemtrails or that might destroy the planet.
[01:41:18.150 --> 01:41:18.430]  Really?
[01:41:19.051 --> 01:41:20.431]  These people are insane.
[01:41:20.451 --> 01:41:27.555]  The science that's out there is fake science in exactly the same way that most of the news you're getting from the mainstream is fake news.
[01:41:28.375 --> 01:41:32.937]  In fact, on my website, science.news, I have a whole column that is science fails.
[01:41:33.377 --> 01:41:38.960]  It's like the homepage is like good science and then there's fake science because I want to highlight the fake science because
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:43.841]  In the realm of science, they try to pull the wool over your eyes and say, oh, it's science.
[01:41:43.881 --> 01:41:44.722]  You can't argue with it.
[01:41:44.762 --> 01:41:47.203]  Just like those Parkland school kids.
[01:41:47.343 --> 01:41:48.523]  You can't argue with these kids.
[01:41:49.463 --> 01:41:49.643]  Why?
[01:41:49.683 --> 01:41:50.544]  Because they were shot at?
[01:41:51.044 --> 01:41:51.964]  You can't argue with them?
[01:41:52.784 --> 01:42:00.467]  I don't know about you, but I've never seen a case where somebody was shot at and their IQ just automatically doubled on complex social issues.
[01:42:00.507 --> 01:42:02.128]  I mean, I'm not saying they don't have a right to speak out.
[01:42:02.188 --> 01:42:02.548]  They do.
[01:42:04.133 --> 01:42:06.814]  Being shot at does not turn you into a genius overnight.
[01:42:07.194 --> 01:42:08.675]  Frankly, it doesn't work that way.
[01:42:08.795 --> 01:42:13.237]  Bullets don't impart cognitive genius onto their intended targets.
[01:42:13.698 --> 01:42:14.758]  They do quite the opposite.
[01:42:15.458 --> 01:42:18.880]  And they're just lying with science constantly, so that's why we put that out there.
[01:42:19.941 --> 01:42:20.401]  We've got
[01:42:21.445 --> 01:42:23.246]  Oh, I don't even know if I should get started with this one.
[01:42:23.286 --> 01:42:29.448]  Yeah, we're gonna go to break here soon because the next thing I've got coming up is so mind-blowing, you won't even believe it.
[01:42:29.508 --> 01:42:33.890]  It's about, they're saying that aliens could crash the U.S.
[01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:34.470]  power grid.
[01:42:35.391 --> 01:42:38.212]  Not illegal aliens, but little green men aliens, that's what they're saying.
[01:42:38.292 --> 01:42:42.834]  Scientists are saying the power grid could go down because of aliens from another planet.
[01:42:42.854 --> 01:42:43.914]  I'm not even making this up.
[01:42:44.434 --> 01:42:45.135]  Stay with me here.
[01:42:45.155 --> 01:42:46.295]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:46.335 --> 01:42:47.436]  Mike Adams filling in today.
[01:42:47.716 --> 01:42:50.277]  We'll be back after this break with that story and much more.
[01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:08.313]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:43:09.034 --> 01:43:12.356]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:43:13.196 --> 01:43:18.780]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:43:21.241 --> 01:43:27.567]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:43:28.387 --> 01:43:33.632]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:43:34.252 --> 01:43:46.383]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:43:46.903 --> 01:43:53.188]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[01:43:53.208 --> 01:43:56.470]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[01:43:56.490 --> 01:44:00.793]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[01:44:00.813 --> 01:44:01.493]  Turmeric has been
[01:44:16.664 --> 01:44:20.065]  It's been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[01:44:20.505 --> 01:44:23.786]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[01:44:24.687 --> 01:44:34.910]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[01:44:35.671 --> 01:44:44.213]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[01:44:45.854 --> 01:44:54.377]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[01:45:12.258 --> 01:45:14.920]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.003]  They found an ad that I had cut for Brain Force, which by the way you should also get in 4WarsStore.com.
[01:45:21.023 --> 01:45:23.344]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[01:45:23.504 --> 01:45:31.688]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April and they found it like it was some secret and they were like, oh my god, this is the funniest thing ever.
[01:45:31.768 --> 01:45:34.649]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over
[01:45:35.069 --> 01:45:44.736]  An ad of me promoting Brain Force, which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take, which everybody has their different brand of.
[01:45:44.836 --> 01:45:48.058]  Oh, but when InfoWars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[01:45:48.178 --> 01:45:55.863]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five-star independent reviews that you see right there on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:55.923 --> 01:45:56.944]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:45:57.024 --> 01:45:59.085]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[01:45:59.125 --> 01:46:00.326]  It was hilarious.
[01:46:02.247 --> 01:46:04.449]  They wrote it at vice.com!
[01:46:04.569 --> 01:46:14.376]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly, that I advertised Brain Force six months ago, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of nootropic.
[01:46:14.416 --> 01:46:16.838]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[01:46:17.419 --> 01:46:23.863]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[01:46:24.444 --> 01:46:26.065]  You gonna go after Joe Rogan too?
[01:46:27.245 --> 01:46:33.547]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for Brain Force.
[01:46:33.607 --> 01:46:35.727]  Well here I'm making another one right now.
[01:46:36.087 --> 01:46:37.248]  Gonna get triggered over this?
[01:46:37.328 --> 01:46:37.568]  Good.
[01:46:37.828 --> 01:46:39.128]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[01:46:39.308 --> 01:46:44.029]  You're literally making Infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[01:46:44.309 --> 01:46:46.390]  Carry on with your autistic screeching.
[01:46:46.830 --> 01:46:49.192]  Because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[01:46:49.533 --> 01:46:52.435]  If that's all you've got, it's quite pathetic at this point.
[01:46:52.455 --> 01:46:53.937]  Get your BrainForce right now.
[01:46:53.957 --> 01:46:54.978]  BrainForce Plus.
[01:46:55.038 --> 01:46:58.161]  Personally recommended by me at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:47:06.368 --> 01:47:08.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.982 --> 01:47:28.131]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:28.853 --> 01:47:30.296]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:34.747 --> 01:47:45.254]  You are back at the tip of the spear here, fighting for your liberty, your right to speak your mind, even your right to think, your right to disagree, your right to ask questions, your right to engage in debate.
[01:47:46.275 --> 01:47:58.083]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today, and as part of the bullying of the left that is attempting to stamp out everyone's speech who disagrees with the delusional rhetoric of the left,
[01:47:58.703 --> 01:48:00.844]  Ted Nugent is being censored as well.
[01:48:00.884 --> 01:48:06.405]  There are efforts underway to crush his upcoming tour in the name of political correctness.
[01:48:06.465 --> 01:48:10.947]  Yes, they're attacking music and speech and religion in America.
[01:48:10.987 --> 01:48:15.628]  I mean, is there anything that the left won't try to destroy on their march toward tyranny?
[01:48:16.228 --> 01:48:19.009]  The answer is there's nothing that they won't try to destroy.
[01:48:19.069 --> 01:48:21.210]  But Ted Nugent has a video.
[01:48:21.230 --> 01:48:22.530]  It's about a four minute clip here.
[01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:26.171]  He's going to tell you what's going on and why he's under attack as well.
[01:48:26.211 --> 01:48:27.052]  Let's listen to that.
[01:48:27.172 --> 01:48:27.692]  Then I'll be back.
[01:48:29.329 --> 01:48:35.613]  Right now is a full force attack from truth, logic, and common sense Americans.
[01:48:40.016 --> 01:48:48.621]  We're seeing right now the biggest purge online of conservative sites, veteran sites, gun sites, shooting clubs, Christian sites.
[01:48:48.681 --> 01:48:50.182]  I've never seen such a purge.
[01:48:50.322 --> 01:48:51.503]  I've been thrown off
[01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:53.511]  Forever.
[01:48:53.871 --> 01:48:59.455]  But this year, I had this great tour, and all the promoters are coming out, Nugent's coming back out, book Nugent, book Nugent.
[01:48:59.836 --> 01:49:06.801]  I won't mention any names now, in hopes that the negotiations can continue and move forward on an honest level.
[01:49:07.141 --> 01:49:13.927]  But I have been thrown out by the biggest promoters in the world, because I'm on the board of the NRA.
[01:49:14.167 --> 01:49:20.912]  And I promise you, if I was recently arrested for heroin distribution, they would have not thrown me off.
[01:49:20.992 --> 01:49:21.432]  Exactly.
[01:49:22.393 --> 01:49:35.982]  But because I'm on the board of the Family Grassroots Organization of the National Rifle Association that stands for self-defense, I've been thrown off tens of millions of dollars in revenue because I believe in self-defense.
[01:49:36.042 --> 01:49:40.545]  Exactly, and that's the sacrifice that... I mean, you go to the Rolling Stone articles attacking you and I.
[01:49:40.765 --> 01:49:43.846]  This week, they'll get one or two comments.
[01:49:44.226 --> 01:49:47.027]  Your side has thousands per story, so does mine, and 50 times the traffic.
[01:49:47.047 --> 01:49:47.608]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:49:47.808 --> 01:49:48.228]  You're right.
[01:49:48.328 --> 01:49:49.688]  They have had a cardiac arrest.
[01:49:49.988 --> 01:49:53.910]  They're falling apart, but I don't want to underestimate their counteroffensive.
[01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:54.510]  No, no, we don't.
[01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:57.391]  It doesn't mean that we're complacent by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:49:57.711 --> 01:50:07.115]  Right now is a full force attack from truth, logic, and common sense Americans to continue to crush the dishonesty and the political correctness.
[01:50:07.275 --> 01:50:09.776]  So I'm not compromised or
[01:50:12.014 --> 01:50:13.836]  Controlled by any stretch of the imagination.
[01:50:13.876 --> 01:50:19.622]  I'm still making the greatest music of my life with the greatest band, the greatest crew, and the greatest management, the greatest family.
[01:50:19.922 --> 01:50:22.685]  You seem to be even more empowered in this fight now that they're trying to hold you down.
[01:50:23.186 --> 01:50:34.217]  I think political correctness has backfired and even though fake news and the orchestrated lies of the media, starting in the late 60s quite honestly,
[01:50:35.178 --> 01:50:40.422]  Some people fell for it, but then when they really tune in and pay attention, they see how dishonest it is.
[01:50:40.902 --> 01:50:44.865]  And my backing and my support is at an all-time high right now.
[01:50:44.985 --> 01:50:50.589]  Look at all the claims that I'm a child molester, a draft dodger, that I diss the Native Americans.
[01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:52.651]  It's all lies!
[01:50:52.711 --> 01:50:56.013]  What nasty things, especially my relation with the Native Americans.
[01:50:56.414 --> 01:51:01.858]  I have been invited to almost every Native American tribe to teach their children
[01:51:02.987 --> 01:51:16.792]  The native lifestyle of clean and sober, hands-on conservation, self-sufficiency, hunting, fishing, outdoor conservation, shared sweat lodges with their spiritual leaders since the 60s.
[01:51:17.072 --> 01:51:17.753]  I have been given
[01:51:18.713 --> 01:51:32.203]  felonious eagle feather war bonnets by the elders of numerous tribes because I, in my song Great White Buffalo, and in my promotion of conservation, especially bow hunting, they feel a kinship, a blood brotherhood there with me.
[01:51:32.403 --> 01:51:40.129]  So meanwhile, the Native Americans and I are spiritual blood brothers, so the Huffington Post claims that I called him unclean vermin.
[01:51:42.628 --> 01:51:44.890]  And then some people actually fell for it.
[01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:51.675]  So, you can see that as I say these things, as nasty and horrific and dishonest as they are, you notice that I'm still smiling.
[01:51:52.536 --> 01:51:58.200]  Because I can plow through the dishonesty and the bull**** and still connect with people who are in the acid column.
[01:52:00.142 --> 01:52:07.167]  Coming to the InfoWars, Ted Nugent's The Music Made Me Do It, exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[01:52:22.919 --> 01:52:29.945]  I believe the positive spirit is as strong as it's ever been.
[01:52:30.065 --> 01:52:35.229]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:52:35.269 --> 01:52:38.291]  You are the resistance, and thank you for tuning in today.
[01:52:38.331 --> 01:52:39.492]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:39.552 --> 01:52:42.634]  Mike Adams filling in today, because this is a
[01:52:44.025 --> 01:52:45.846]  This is a collaborative effort at this point.
[01:52:45.947 --> 01:52:50.270]  We are fighting for our survival and we're fighting for your right to exist.
[01:52:50.290 --> 01:52:55.994]  You've got to understand that the attacks on free speech are not just to silence people like Alex Jones or myself.
[01:52:56.775 --> 01:53:07.723]  Ultimately, the left believes that you, a conservative, liberty-minded individual, or a Christian individual, or a gun-owning individual, they believe that you have no right to exist.
[01:53:08.658 --> 01:53:18.504]  I want you to understand that the kind of philosophy that the left has now adopted is, frankly, it's the kind of thing that has led throughout history to mass genocide and mass executions.
[01:53:18.544 --> 01:53:34.835]  This was like Cultural Revolution, Communist China, the Mao takeover, where young people were told to kill their elders and drag them out of their homes and literally execute them and beat them on the head with bricks and baseball bats until they were dead, and to call the government to come arrest their own parents.
[01:53:35.515 --> 01:53:45.543]  And they dragged people out who are the intellectual leaders of the day, people who, they were targeted for wearing glasses because they thought people who wore glasses were intelligent and could read and could think.
[01:53:46.203 --> 01:53:51.387]  And so they terminated them because the communist regime cannot tolerate anyone who can think.
[01:53:51.948 --> 01:54:03.937]  And that's why, I mean, who watches CNN and believes anything except truly a dumbed-down info consumer who has been mass-hypnotized, indoctrinated, chemically contaminated with
[01:54:04.597 --> 01:54:08.139]  You know, crazy food additives, fluoride in the water supply, everything else.
[01:54:08.199 --> 01:54:12.962]  Who actually, what thinking person could believe anything that they see on CNN?
[01:54:13.482 --> 01:54:14.482]  It's outrageous.
[01:54:14.542 --> 01:54:17.024]  So, I want to thank Ted Nugent for that segment there.
[01:54:18.705 --> 01:54:26.469]  And as I promised before the break, here's a fascinating story that you won't see, well, I guess it is in the media.
[01:54:26.509 --> 01:54:27.870]  It's called, alright, check this out.
[01:54:28.730 --> 01:54:30.091]  Bizarre Research Paper.
[01:54:30.331 --> 01:54:32.611]  This is from, by the way, news.com.au.
[01:54:33.252 --> 01:54:37.713]  Bizarre Research Paper explores the possible scenarios of Earth intercepting an alien message.
[01:54:38.554 --> 01:54:43.875]  Now, according to this paper, the title of the science paper is Interstellar Communication.
[01:54:44.536 --> 01:54:47.077]  Message decontamination is impossible.
[01:54:47.457 --> 01:54:51.258]  And the scientists who worked on this are Michael Hipke and John Learned.
[01:54:51.278 --> 01:54:52.258]  It's what it looks like.
[01:54:52.338 --> 01:54:53.519]  University of Hawaii is one of them.
[01:54:54.713 --> 01:55:04.336]  Just to break it down for you, this paper, at least one interpretation of it, claims that alien messages could crash the US power grid.
[01:55:05.036 --> 01:55:08.657]  Now, it sounds insane, but here it is.
[01:55:08.717 --> 01:55:09.657]  It's in a science paper.
[01:55:09.777 --> 01:55:10.638]  It's in the university.
[01:55:11.878 --> 01:55:15.559]  When I saw this, I thought immediately, this sounds like a cover story.
[01:55:16.499 --> 01:55:20.140]  And I thought, you know, there is a major false flag coming, no doubt in my mind.
[01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:22.361]  This is one of the reasons that they're trying to silence InfoWars.
[01:55:23.464 --> 01:55:26.767]  And silence, you know, my website, Natural News, and all the other voices out there.
[01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:30.009]  I think there is a major, major false flag coming.
[01:55:30.429 --> 01:55:33.171]  And previously I thought, well, maybe that could be a dirty bomb.
[01:55:33.492 --> 01:55:44.740]  You know, like someone gets some medical imaging equipment, some radio isotopes, wraps it around like a conventional explosive, and gets a, you know, drops it out of a Cessna over a city or something, you know, because that's what terrorists do.
[01:55:45.601 --> 01:55:48.343]  But now I'm thinking, what if they crash the whole power grid?
[01:55:49.855 --> 01:55:51.375]  And blamed it on aliens!
[01:55:51.415 --> 01:55:56.637]  Yes, you see, they can't blame it on the Russians, because no one would believe that at this point.
[01:55:56.937 --> 01:55:58.857]  Oh, that might have been the previous cover story.
[01:56:00.297 --> 01:56:01.598]  Maybe let's try to blame Alex Jones.
[01:56:01.618 --> 01:56:03.838]  Like, Alex Jones crashed the National Power Grid.
[01:56:04.178 --> 01:56:11.340]  No, they can't blame it on climate change, because no one believes that story anymore, even though the mainstream science tries to blame everything on climate change.
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:16.481]  Like, oh, the loss of libido in women 25 to 30 caused by climate change.
[01:56:16.501 --> 01:56:17.962]  You know, you see these articles everywhere.
[01:56:18.002 --> 01:56:18.562]  It's insane.
[01:56:19.742 --> 01:56:21.423]  They have to have a new boogeyman.
[01:56:22.283 --> 01:56:27.024]  So I think they're going to blame the aliens, like actual little green men from planet Zorg.
[01:56:27.044 --> 01:56:36.667]  And they can just turn off all the power grids, just have like a deep state built Stuxnet virus, you know, because, hey, the US intelligence built that thing.
[01:56:36.927 --> 01:56:41.089]  They took out the centrifuge systems in Iran, their nuclear program.
[01:56:42.082 --> 01:56:43.103]  They could take down the U.S.
[01:56:43.143 --> 01:56:46.526]  power grid, right, just crash the whole system, unleash mass chaos in the cities.
[01:56:47.526 --> 01:56:52.430]  And by the time the power grid comes back on, like, they'll have assassinated Trump.
[01:56:53.111 --> 01:57:00.237]  Infowars.com domain name will be turned into like a daily happiness tips blog, and they'll have Hillary Clinton in the White House.
[01:57:00.837 --> 01:57:03.801]  And CNN will claim that Trump never won the election at all.
[01:57:03.821 --> 01:57:05.763]  What is this, conspiracy theorists?
[01:57:05.783 --> 01:57:07.104]  You think Trump won the election?
[01:57:07.164 --> 01:57:07.345]  No.
[01:57:07.525 --> 01:57:12.591]  They'll memory hole the last year and a half and they'll say, no, Hillary's always been president.
[01:57:13.031 --> 01:57:14.413]  Then they'll just silence everybody.
[01:57:16.574 --> 01:57:18.815]  They just put up this crazy, insane picture.
[01:57:18.875 --> 01:57:19.376]  I'm laughing.
[01:57:19.676 --> 01:57:23.397]  It's like Hillary as an alien grey with black eyes.
[01:57:23.758 --> 01:57:24.218]  It's insane.
[01:57:24.498 --> 01:57:26.899]  I'm just telling you, I don't believe this stuff.
[01:57:26.919 --> 01:57:35.943]  I think it's nonsense, but it's the kind of thing that they, the legacy media, would try to push as a cover story for anything they want to pull off.
[01:57:36.023 --> 01:57:36.663]  It's insane.
[01:57:37.544 --> 01:57:38.504]  There's a lot more coming here.
[01:57:38.964 --> 01:57:41.346]  A lot of interesting news ahead on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:41.366 --> 01:57:42.106]  Thank you for joining me.
[01:57:42.146 --> 01:57:42.966]  Mike Adams filling in.
[01:57:43.226 --> 01:57:44.427]  We'll be right back after this break.
[01:57:52.357 --> 01:58:01.129]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:02.403 --> 01:58:04.205]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:04.265 --> 01:58:11.393]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:17.599]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:19.581]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[01:58:20.202 --> 01:58:29.749]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love.
[01:58:29.989 --> 01:58:39.256]  Because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:40.337 --> 01:58:44.460]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:50.043]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:58:50.463 --> 01:58:51.504]  As above, so below.
[01:58:52.064 --> 01:58:54.886]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[01:58:55.786 --> 01:58:56.867]  Most tiny of scales.
[01:58:57.387 --> 01:58:58.468]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:58.889 --> 01:59:00.390]  America is building its wall.
[01:59:00.770 --> 01:59:01.251]  Will it work?
[01:59:01.391 --> 01:59:01.891]  We don't know.
[01:59:02.371 --> 01:59:02.972]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:03.653 --> 01:59:05.794]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:06.275 --> 01:59:09.878]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work.
[01:59:10.298 --> 01:59:12.260]  And without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:17.284]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family.
[01:59:17.304 --> 01:59:18.525]  And I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:19.245 --> 01:59:25.552]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:26.293 --> 01:59:28.835]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95.
[01:59:28.915 --> 01:59:33.981]  But we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:41.969 --> 01:59:44.330]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:48.231]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:48.571 --> 01:59:52.292]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:54.713 --> 02:00:00.635]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.555 --> 02:00:19.449]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:00:20.011 --> 02:00:21.396]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.532 --> 02:00:27.073]  All right, thank you for joining us in this segment.
[02:00:27.113 --> 02:00:29.556]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today.
[02:00:29.576 --> 02:00:32.118]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:32.138 --> 02:00:41.006]  We're going to be joined after this next segment by another person who has been targeted in a censorship purge that the radical left says is not happening.
[02:00:41.206 --> 02:00:42.167]  Oh, it's not happening.
[02:00:42.227 --> 02:00:49.594]  No one's being purged except everyone that we know is being censored and bullied and cut off and economically sabotaged and you name it.
[02:00:50.174 --> 02:00:52.735]  But we're going to be joined by Gary Franchi from The Next News Network.
[02:00:53.275 --> 02:00:56.477]  And last segment, we're joined by Jim Hoft from The Gateway Pundit.
[02:00:56.497 --> 02:01:00.258]  If you missed that, you definitely want to check out that video online.
[02:01:01.018 --> 02:01:03.840]  Just a couple of minutes here before we get that started, I'm going to cover some headlines.
[02:01:05.336 --> 02:01:07.037]  We're going to take calls in this third hour.
[02:01:07.477 --> 02:01:08.278]  So the phone number is 877-789-2539.
[02:01:08.298 --> 02:01:10.659]  I'll repeat it again in the next segment, but it's 877-789-2539.
[02:01:10.679 --> 02:01:12.180]  And I very much welcome your calls.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:16.303]  For the rest of this segment, I want to answer a couple of questions people have been asking me.
[02:01:16.323 --> 02:01:17.343]  So number one, this is funny.
[02:01:30.051 --> 02:01:33.572]  Dude, why is your face kind of red here on the InfoWars studio?
[02:01:34.632 --> 02:01:37.233]  Truth be told, I'm actually Native American.
[02:01:37.853 --> 02:01:46.655]  There's a lot of Native American blood in my blood, and my face tends to be sort of reddish colored, which is really interesting.
[02:01:47.575 --> 02:01:49.276]  I'm not actually steaming mad or anything.
[02:01:49.616 --> 02:01:53.897]  I'm actually having a great time here hosting the InfoWars broadcast.
[02:01:54.337 --> 02:01:56.237]  But also, I do a lot of outside training.
[02:01:56.277 --> 02:01:56.997]  I'm outside a lot.
[02:01:57.017 --> 02:01:57.738]  I get a lot of sun.
[02:01:57.778 --> 02:01:58.698]  You know, I live on a ranch.
[02:01:59.398 --> 02:02:03.721]  I take care of donkeys and goats and the free range chickens that we have.
[02:02:04.241 --> 02:02:06.483]  And I also train outdoors with firearms training.
[02:02:06.523 --> 02:02:11.686]  So I do a lot of tactical firearms training, carbine training, pistol training, long range target shooting.
[02:02:11.726 --> 02:02:12.447]  It's all outdoors.
[02:02:12.887 --> 02:02:16.810]  You know, there is no thousand yard indoor range that I've ever found.
[02:02:16.830 --> 02:02:18.611]  You're going to shoot a thousand yards.
[02:02:18.991 --> 02:02:19.892]  You got to go outdoors.
[02:02:19.952 --> 02:02:23.454]  So I'm outdoors a lot, doing a lot of training, getting up to speed.
[02:02:23.474 --> 02:02:24.315]  I've been doing it for years.
[02:02:25.375 --> 02:02:28.878]  Very, very competent in firearms, which I believe all of us need to be.
[02:02:30.118 --> 02:02:34.601]  You just never know with the crime going through the roof and the assaults on our liberties.
[02:02:34.621 --> 02:02:39.343]  You know, the Second Amendment is not just designed to protect us from tyrants.
[02:02:39.443 --> 02:02:49.048]  It's also important to protect us from, you know, a liberal mob of people trying to kill us and trying to take away, you know, our property.
[02:02:49.068 --> 02:02:49.988]  Think about communism.
[02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:54.511]  Every time it takes over a country, they steal your land, they steal your businesses, right?
[02:02:54.911 --> 02:02:58.293]  They arrest those who are resisting communism.
[02:02:59.233 --> 02:03:04.658]  And frankly, there are many cases throughout history, if the people had firearms, they'd be able to fight back.
[02:03:05.158 --> 02:03:15.667]  I mean, even Nazi Germany and the Jews, if the Jewish people had been fully armed, they could have resisted more effectively.
[02:03:15.707 --> 02:03:19.290]  They could have taken out more Nazi soldiers, even if they didn't 100% win.
[02:03:20.771 --> 02:03:23.352]  They would have made it more costly to the Germans.
[02:03:23.712 --> 02:03:38.014]  And I believe, isn't there a group today called Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership, JPFO, I think is an actual group out there, and I think their slogan is something like, never forget, firearms are for protecting us from tyranny.
[02:03:38.534 --> 02:03:43.095]  And that message has never been more true than it is right now here in the United States today.
[02:03:43.415 --> 02:03:46.436]  They're coming for our speech, they're coming for our guns, they're coming for
[02:03:47.566 --> 02:03:47.886]  Everything.
[02:03:47.926 --> 02:03:48.967]  Our privacy.
[02:03:49.487 --> 02:03:50.848]  They're silencing us.
[02:03:50.909 --> 02:03:53.190]  They're committing economic sabotage.
[02:03:53.210 --> 02:03:57.113]  They're going after us at every level while they're saying, oh, it's not even happening.
[02:03:57.453 --> 02:03:58.494]  This is not happening.
[02:03:58.954 --> 02:03:59.455]  Don't watch.
[02:03:59.795 --> 02:04:04.158]  Don't look while we're bashing everybody and try to ruin them economically.
[02:04:04.218 --> 02:04:04.659]  It's insane.
[02:04:05.399 --> 02:04:10.548]  But coming up in the next segment, we're going to talk to Gary Franchi, who has more thoughts on censorship of the media.
[02:04:10.989 --> 02:04:11.911]  And we'll take your call-ins.
[02:04:12.452 --> 02:04:12.913]  Your calls.
[02:04:12.933 --> 02:04:13.874]  877-789-2539 is the number to call in.
[02:04:18.996 --> 02:04:22.942]  And I especially would love your questions for me.
[02:04:22.962 --> 02:04:30.232]  It's been four and a half, maybe five years since I hosted here on InfoWars, and I really welcome your questions, and I really appreciate you.
[02:04:30.252 --> 02:04:31.894]  I appreciate your support.
[02:04:31.954 --> 02:04:35.519]  I appreciate what you do for this liberty
[02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:38.851]  Mike Adams here filling in for Alex Jones.
[02:04:38.992 --> 02:04:40.232]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:05:05.979 --> 02:05:24.263]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:05:24.363 --> 02:05:29.965]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:05:30.665 --> 02:05:31.325]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:05:31.765 --> 02:05:34.606]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:05:35.266 --> 02:05:36.226]  And so much more.
[02:05:36.807 --> 02:05:37.927]  It is concentrated.
[02:05:38.147 --> 02:05:39.868]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:05:39.888 --> 02:05:45.570]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:05:45.690 --> 02:05:46.890]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:48.831]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:05:48.911 --> 02:05:51.291]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:05:51.512 --> 02:05:52.772]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:05:52.952 --> 02:05:54.753]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:05:55.313 --> 02:05:55.913]  Immune Wall.
[02:05:56.013 --> 02:05:57.334]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:57.454 --> 02:05:58.634]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:32.811 --> 02:06:38.857]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:06:39.258 --> 02:06:41.380]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:45.219 --> 02:06:58.369]  You know, part of the extreme deception by the left is not only the targeting of conservative and libertarian voices for censorship, but also their absurd claim that there is no targeting going on.
[02:06:58.829 --> 02:07:00.451]  I mean, this is just epic.
[02:07:00.511 --> 02:07:03.453]  This is a whole new level of deception that they're engaged in.
[02:07:03.513 --> 02:07:14.702]  It's like they would go to a community of liberty-minded, like a liberty neighborhood somewhere at 3 in the morning and just kick down everybody's door and shoot people in the head.
[02:07:15.362 --> 02:07:17.383]  And then claim we didn't shoot anybody in the head.
[02:07:17.423 --> 02:07:19.885]  No, they ran into doorstops.
[02:07:20.945 --> 02:07:21.666]  We're not doing that.
[02:07:21.746 --> 02:07:22.266]  No, no.
[02:07:22.486 --> 02:07:23.567]  We love all those people.
[02:07:23.587 --> 02:07:25.187]  We love the First Amendment.
[02:07:25.227 --> 02:07:25.708]  No, you don't.
[02:07:26.228 --> 02:07:27.289]  You hate the First Amendment.
[02:07:27.309 --> 02:07:27.869]  You leftists.
[02:07:28.289 --> 02:07:28.969]  You globalists.
[02:07:29.009 --> 02:07:30.310]  You evil operatives.
[02:07:30.370 --> 02:07:31.511]  You hate America.
[02:07:32.091 --> 02:07:33.012]  You hate liberty.
[02:07:33.472 --> 02:07:35.013]  You hate independent thinking.
[02:07:35.113 --> 02:07:37.934]  You hate voices of truth and freedom.
[02:07:38.595 --> 02:07:42.817]  And that's why you're trying to crush them while claiming you're not crushing anything.
[02:07:43.237 --> 02:07:44.198]  You're not fooling anybody.
[02:07:45.418 --> 02:07:46.759]  You're just not fooling anybody.
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:08:00.830]  And joining us in this segment is someone else who is not fooled, but is being targeted as further evidence that this targeting is systematic, it's happening, the purge is on, and it is specifically singling out voices who are pro-liberty.
[02:08:01.971 --> 02:08:03.032]  His name is Gary Franchi.
[02:08:03.052 --> 02:08:04.112]  He's from Next News Network.
[02:08:04.152 --> 02:08:07.155]  He joins us now by Skype to discuss what's been happening to him.
[02:08:07.215 --> 02:08:09.116]  Gary, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:10.437 --> 02:08:11.358]  Hey Mike, it's great to see you.
[02:08:11.963 --> 02:08:12.824]  That's good to have you on.
[02:08:12.884 --> 02:08:14.946]  Now, you've seen what's happening out there.
[02:08:15.006 --> 02:08:19.770]  Tell us how you are being censored and demonetized and targeted so that, you know, the listeners can hear.
[02:08:19.810 --> 02:08:22.172]  This is not just me or Alex or Jim Hoft.
[02:08:22.532 --> 02:08:23.053]  It's you too.
[02:08:23.133 --> 02:08:23.993]  It's many people out there.
[02:08:24.013 --> 02:08:24.774]  What's happening to you?
[02:08:25.955 --> 02:08:32.461]  Well, what we've seen through our analytics since, well, I mean, of course, we had the adpocalypse, which took place back in March.
[02:08:33.221 --> 02:08:38.486]  But we also are looking at the analytics from late October.
[02:08:39.491 --> 02:08:42.892]  Last year, we saw a 75% drop in viewership.
[02:08:43.772 --> 02:08:46.873]  And we attribute that to an algorithm shift that YouTube announced.
[02:08:47.453 --> 02:09:07.479]  And now, if you take a look at the analytics between CNN, MSNBC, all these different left-wing media outlets, you compare them against Alex Jones, Next News Network, InfoWars, you compare the viewership rating for, like, Social Blade, you can actually see a specific and real
[02:09:08.351 --> 02:09:10.655]  Like, it's like the complete shift.
[02:09:11.155 --> 02:09:12.818]  Ours goes down while theirs goes up.
[02:09:13.078 --> 02:09:15.462]  This is all reactionary from the election.
[02:09:15.722 --> 02:09:21.371]  They are so upset that they lost the election and they continue to blame social media, conservative viewpoints.
[02:09:21.751 --> 02:09:23.574]  They blame all these viewpoints so that
[02:09:24.801 --> 02:09:34.764]  They can suppress our voices and then they go ahead and they weight the scales, Mike, in the algorithm so that our stuff goes down and theirs goes up.
[02:09:34.964 --> 02:09:37.485]  That's just one point that we noticed back in October.
[02:09:37.585 --> 02:09:40.585]  They're admitting that we are being effective.
[02:09:40.646 --> 02:09:43.126]  That, in fact, we are persuasive.
[02:09:43.146 --> 02:09:48.728]  Because if you think about it, their position is that things that you say or things that Alex says are total nonsense.
[02:09:49.608 --> 02:09:51.088]  And thus, don't make any sense.
[02:09:51.148 --> 02:09:52.469]  Well, then why censor them?
[02:09:52.829 --> 02:10:00.590]  You know, if what you're saying, Gary, is complete nonsense, then why not allow you to broadcast your nonsense and look like a fool to the world?
[02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:02.791]  But in truth, you make a lot of sense.
[02:10:03.131 --> 02:10:04.571]  You're invoking logic and reason.
[02:10:04.971 --> 02:10:09.972]  You are bringing people real truth and real news, and it is compelling, and that's why we're being censored.
[02:10:09.992 --> 02:10:11.113]  Does that sound right?
[02:10:12.153 --> 02:10:13.833]  They don't want people to think, Mike.
[02:10:13.993 --> 02:10:15.073]  They want people to be drones.
[02:10:15.113 --> 02:10:17.954]  They want people to just go about their daily lives, you know, and just
[02:10:19.150 --> 02:10:21.352]  You know, having no critical thoughts.
[02:10:21.972 --> 02:10:26.236]  So when we introduce critical thinking to people... Right, it's demanding conformity, yes.
[02:10:26.256 --> 02:10:26.876]  Exactly.
[02:10:26.896 --> 02:10:27.877]  So we're making people think.
[02:10:28.573 --> 02:10:31.035]  And then that creates, you know, a reaction.
[02:10:31.055 --> 02:10:31.956]  They have to make a decision.
[02:10:32.016 --> 02:10:33.377]  And what do they do?
[02:10:33.717 --> 02:10:34.458]  They vote in the polls.
[02:10:34.498 --> 02:10:35.318]  They vote for Donald Trump.
[02:10:35.338 --> 02:10:38.441]  And then they come back and try to blame the people for influencing them.
[02:10:38.461 --> 02:10:41.203]  We're presenting simple facts and information.
[02:10:41.703 --> 02:10:45.006]  I mean, we're getting attacked by the New York Times, Washington Post, The Guardian.
[02:10:45.286 --> 02:10:46.727]  We're getting attacked at all fronts.
[02:10:46.767 --> 02:10:48.509]  And now we're seeing the demonetization.
[02:10:48.529 --> 02:10:51.091]  I mean, Mike, what I have to go through every single day
[02:10:51.551 --> 02:11:02.040]  Every single day, when I go through my documents and I take a look at all the articles I'm going to read for the day, I have to do a keyword scrub for words I know are going to get flagged by the system, by the algorithm.
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:03.442]  What are some of those keywords?
[02:11:03.462 --> 02:11:04.883]  Just tell us what some of those words are.
[02:11:05.944 --> 02:11:07.265]  Oh, one thing, sure.
[02:11:07.305 --> 02:11:08.346]  We noticed this a time ago.
[02:11:08.386 --> 02:11:08.927]  It's ISIS.
[02:11:09.007 --> 02:11:10.108]  It's something you cannot say.
[02:11:10.888 --> 02:11:17.794]  And what happens, when you say ISIS, the voice print analysis at YouTube, what happens is,
[02:11:19.062 --> 02:11:24.368]  It takes your voice, puts it into text, and that creates metadata for the system, and then they demonetize it.
[02:11:24.608 --> 02:11:24.829]  Wow.
[02:11:24.889 --> 02:11:29.454]  Anything related to Parkland, I've been scrubbing Parkland, shooting.
[02:11:29.474 --> 02:11:36.762]  I mean, we noticed just the other day we did a report where they were scrubbing guns from the shopping tab at Google.
[02:11:37.503 --> 02:11:37.743]  Wow.
[02:11:37.883 --> 02:11:38.983]  Yeah, of course.
[02:11:39.003 --> 02:11:39.964]  That's been widely reported.
[02:11:41.104 --> 02:11:47.846]  By the way, I'm going to keep it to the next segment, but change your background from an animation to a still image and your frame rate will improve.
[02:11:49.246 --> 02:11:52.667]  It's causing a very slow frame rate, but that's just a technical issue.
[02:11:52.887 --> 02:11:54.688]  What you're saying is right on point.
[02:11:55.108 --> 02:11:57.269]  And this is systematic targeting.
[02:11:57.529 --> 02:11:58.729]  What are you hearing from other people?
[02:11:58.749 --> 02:12:02.030]  Because you have a lot of contacts in conservative news as well.
[02:12:02.290 --> 02:12:03.630]  What are you hearing from other people?
[02:12:03.930 --> 02:12:05.891]  Are they experiencing the same targeting?
[02:12:06.451 --> 02:12:07.573]  That you're being subjected to?
[02:12:07.593 --> 02:12:09.976]  Or are some people getting by unscathed?
[02:12:11.217 --> 02:12:16.163]  No, I think it's actually... I'm... There are people getting completely banned from YouTube.
[02:12:16.183 --> 02:12:18.165]  I mean, they're getting shut down, free strike.
[02:12:19.427 --> 02:12:19.607]  Yeah.
[02:12:19.627 --> 02:12:20.388]  I mean, that's it.
[02:12:20.408 --> 02:12:21.710]  They blocked me on Saturday, by the way.
[02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:24.513]  They just took down the whole Health Ranger account.
[02:12:24.693 --> 02:12:25.154]  1,700 plus videos.
[02:12:25.294 --> 02:12:25.715]  Just gone.
[02:12:26.893 --> 02:12:30.835]  Yeah, you're one of the affected parties, and hopefully we can get some help for you there.
[02:12:31.675 --> 02:12:42.479]  I mean, we had a strike on our channel because we used the term crisis actor in a video that was three years old, and it wasn't even related to anything other than a military exercise that took place in Arizona.
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:43.820]  You know?
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.361]  Yeah, but just the term crisis actor gets you flagged, right?
[02:12:47.962 --> 02:12:50.723]  Just the term crisis actor gets you flagged.
[02:12:50.963 --> 02:12:56.245]  You know, the term false flag, anything that has to do with any sort of shooting or critical crisis deal,
[02:12:57.005 --> 02:13:01.409]  It's like, man, you have to scrub, you have to use generalized terminology just so you can speak the truth.
[02:13:03.751 --> 02:13:09.675]  I guess the new narrative is that when there's a shooting that no one can ask any questions now whatsoever.
[02:13:10.116 --> 02:13:19.684]  If children were killed in this event, which they were, that you can't even, like journalism is now illegal in America surrounding shooting events.
[02:13:19.724 --> 02:13:24.648]  You can't ask questions, you can't voice a differing opinion, you can't criticize
[02:13:25.188 --> 02:13:35.417]  Well, I think the worst part about it is you've got these kids coming out and the kids are being manipulated by the media and by the leftists so that the kids are untouchable.
[02:13:47.665 --> 02:13:54.952]  I think that's probably one of the scariest thing that we've seen come out of this last event, is that the manipulation of children to further the agenda.
[02:13:55.153 --> 02:13:57.315]  But that's, I guess it's been going on for a long time, Mike.
[02:13:57.335 --> 02:13:59.016]  They always say it's for the children, for the children.
[02:13:59.217 --> 02:14:07.465]  But now they get some young, fresh-faced kids who have been just recently, you know, victimized in a very, very graphic situation.
[02:14:07.605 --> 02:14:11.629]  And now, and they can articulate, they can go in front of the cameras, they can repeat talking points.
[02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:15.171]  And I think that's really the scariest thing coming out of it.
[02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:19.952]  And unfortunately, I think we're going to see more of that because they see the effectiveness of it.
[02:14:20.392 --> 02:14:28.094]  And they're using that as the weapon, the bludgeon, to shut down free speech and any critical thoughts or critical questions of those narratives.
[02:14:28.134 --> 02:14:28.314]  Right.
[02:14:28.374 --> 02:14:35.415]  And Jim Hoff was telling us in the last hour that they're now indoctrinating children as young as nine years old to join these anti-gun marches.
[02:14:35.455 --> 02:14:37.216]  I mean, you talk about brainwashing.
[02:14:37.916 --> 02:14:45.082]  I mean, and they don't tell the kids that it is disarmed populations throughout history that have been exterminated by government genocide.
[02:14:45.382 --> 02:14:47.664]  The term is called democide.
[02:14:47.684 --> 02:14:53.188]  262 million people have been murdered by governments in the last, like, century and a half.
[02:14:53.208 --> 02:14:53.569]  262 million people!
[02:14:55.450 --> 02:15:02.700]  How come they're not marching against genocide to say, hey, the Second Amendment protects us, protects our rights, protects us against tyranny?
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:04.262]  You know, they're never being told that.
[02:15:04.302 --> 02:15:05.523]  But Gary, stay with us.
[02:15:05.543 --> 02:15:07.406]  I'm going to hold you over for the next segment.
[02:15:07.927 --> 02:15:10.530]  I just want to mention to people, I think you should call
[02:15:11.451 --> 02:15:15.093]  Your representatives in Washington today, here's the switchboard number for the U.S.
[02:15:15.113 --> 02:15:17.735]  Capitol, 202-224-3121.
[02:15:18.596 --> 02:15:31.164]  That number again is 202-224-3121, and demand antitrust action and regulation of these tech giant companies to halt their politically biased censorship.
[02:15:31.744 --> 02:15:33.645]  This is the action item for today.
[02:15:34.025 --> 02:15:38.548]  Call the Capitol Switchboard 202-224-3121.
[02:15:38.868 --> 02:15:45.531]  Demand antitrust action and regulatory protections of free speech in the online ecosystem.
[02:15:46.031 --> 02:15:46.692]  This is crucial.
[02:15:46.732 --> 02:15:49.353]  We'll be right back with more here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:49.653 --> 02:15:50.774]  Mike Adams filling in today.
[02:15:51.014 --> 02:15:53.275]  We're talking with Gary Franchi of Next News Network.
[02:15:53.555 --> 02:15:54.836]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:16:03.223 --> 02:16:04.944]  Joe Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[02:16:05.084 --> 02:16:09.646]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:10.407 --> 02:16:12.108]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[02:16:12.148 --> 02:16:14.569]  Directed by the amazing director, Joe Gilbert.
[02:16:14.609 --> 02:16:15.449]  Here is the trailer.
[02:16:15.909 --> 02:16:20.112]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[02:16:21.052 --> 02:16:23.794]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:16:24.134 --> 02:16:25.855]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[02:16:25.915 --> 02:16:26.435]  Who cares?
[02:16:30.051 --> 02:16:31.051]  You haven't been called.
[02:16:32.972 --> 02:16:34.312]  Go back to Univision.
[02:16:34.432 --> 02:16:36.473]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[02:16:36.493 --> 02:16:36.913]  Very low energy.
[02:16:36.933 --> 02:16:38.193]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[02:16:38.233 --> 02:16:38.613]  Throw him out.
[02:16:38.653 --> 02:16:42.674]  Throw him out into the cold.
[02:16:42.734 --> 02:16:44.295]  Don't give him their coat.
[02:16:44.715 --> 02:16:49.876]  No coats.
[02:16:50.236 --> 02:16:51.576]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[02:16:51.616 --> 02:16:52.797]  Lying dead.
[02:16:57.403 --> 02:17:01.746]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[02:17:01.786 --> 02:17:05.508]  The most dishonest human beings.
[02:17:05.528 --> 02:17:06.429]  These people right here.
[02:17:08.010 --> 02:17:11.992]  Look at all the cameras.
[02:17:12.012 --> 02:17:12.973]  So disgusting.
[02:17:12.993 --> 02:17:14.574]  This socialist slash communist.
[02:17:14.594 --> 02:17:14.914]  Crazy bird.
[02:17:14.974 --> 02:17:16.175]  He's crazy as a middler.
[02:17:16.215 --> 02:17:19.377]  Pocahontas?
[02:17:19.397 --> 02:17:20.038]  The Indian?
[02:17:20.078 --> 02:17:21.419]  Very offensive.
[02:17:21.459 --> 02:17:22.259]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:17:22.639 --> 02:17:23.440]  A Pocahontas?
[02:17:25.489 --> 02:17:26.450]  Crooked Hillary!
[02:17:26.530 --> 02:17:27.691]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[02:17:27.711 --> 02:17:29.812]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[02:17:29.832 --> 02:17:35.416]  Crooked Hillary!
[02:17:35.436 --> 02:17:37.958]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[02:17:38.338 --> 02:17:42.901]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[02:17:43.322 --> 02:17:46.144]  This had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out.
[02:17:48.263 --> 02:17:50.385]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[02:17:50.585 --> 02:17:52.387]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[02:17:52.407 --> 02:17:53.769]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[02:17:54.449 --> 02:17:56.011]  Because they were protecting him.
[02:17:56.111 --> 02:17:57.012]  I'm trying to be nice.
[02:17:57.052 --> 02:17:58.554]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[02:17:59.855 --> 02:18:01.436]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[02:18:01.677 --> 02:18:03.479]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[02:18:03.519 --> 02:18:04.680]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[02:18:06.434 --> 02:18:08.876]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[02:18:08.996 --> 02:18:09.716]  It just doesn't work.
[02:18:09.756 --> 02:18:11.898]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[02:18:12.998 --> 02:18:14.860]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[02:18:14.900 --> 02:18:17.702]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[02:18:18.842 --> 02:18:20.644]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[02:18:20.944 --> 02:18:24.226]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[02:18:24.506 --> 02:18:25.447]  Repeat after me.
[02:18:25.467 --> 02:18:28.289]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[02:18:28.349 --> 02:18:29.730]  That's not going to happen.
[02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:31.051]  So help me God.
[02:18:31.371 --> 02:18:32.732]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:18:38.797 --> 02:18:41.819]  We will make America great again!
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:44.121]  Go home to mommy.
[02:18:44.441 --> 02:18:45.662]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[02:18:45.963 --> 02:18:47.504]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[02:18:48.837 --> 02:18:50.118]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[02:18:50.138 --> 02:18:50.899]  We've carried them all.
[02:18:51.179 --> 02:18:51.800]  We sell them all.
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:52.561]  They're all groundbreaking.
[02:18:52.581 --> 02:18:54.362]  But this one, this one is fun.
[02:18:55.023 --> 02:18:56.304]  And very, very celebratory.
[02:18:56.324 --> 02:18:58.866]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[02:18:58.887 --> 02:18:59.707]  It's really a special film.
[02:19:00.828 --> 02:19:01.289]  Thanks a lot.
[02:19:01.329 --> 02:19:06.133]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[02:19:06.934 --> 02:19:09.617]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[02:19:10.257 --> 02:19:12.940]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[02:19:13.500 --> 02:19:26.013]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[02:19:26.313 --> 02:19:29.476]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[02:19:29.536 --> 02:19:30.517]  That's why it stuck.
[02:19:30.717 --> 02:19:35.743]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[02:19:35.883 --> 02:19:36.784]  I thought I knew Trump.
[02:19:37.404 --> 02:19:59.936]  Trump I thought I knew him only when you see this all back-to-back how he reacts from the heart he speaks from the heart he said what he said he meant what he said even if it's a little inarticulate or doesn't quite make sense people understood he was exactly they say Trump's a fake it's the opposite all right info or store.com ladies and gentlemen get the new film your mother is voting for Trump
[02:20:05.876 --> 02:20:12.059]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.304 --> 02:20:23.405]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:25.686 --> 02:20:31.289]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:44.628 --> 02:20:46.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:46.489 --> 02:20:53.595]  Today is really, this is a discussion of censorship, gone wild, tyranny on parade.
[02:20:54.316 --> 02:21:03.684]  And we've been talking to many other people today who have also been targeted with the censorship purge that the insane, delusional left is trying to pretend isn't happening.
[02:21:04.384 --> 02:21:05.865]  So, I was censored.
[02:21:06.045 --> 02:21:11.947]  My entire YouTube channel was taken down on Saturday, just a few days after I appeared on InfoWars as a guest.
[02:21:12.647 --> 02:21:17.089]  Google censored my website a year ago, took us down for six days for no reason whatsoever.
[02:21:17.129 --> 02:21:17.809]  That was natural news.
[02:21:18.689 --> 02:21:22.671]  We talked to Jim Hoft from the Gateway Pundit, who has been subjected to this censorship tyranny.
[02:21:23.757 --> 02:21:25.498]  Infowars is being attacked by CNN.
[02:21:25.899 --> 02:21:27.840]  Paul Joseph Watson is being attacked.
[02:21:28.861 --> 02:21:35.825]  CNN is committing economic sabotage now against Infowars, trying to take away the revenue that supports this operation.
[02:21:36.386 --> 02:21:39.888]  Go to InfowarsStore.com, by the way, to defeat CNN's attempt.
[02:21:40.408 --> 02:21:45.492]  And now we're joined by Gary Franchi of the Next News Network, who is also targeted.
[02:21:45.552 --> 02:21:48.154]  So, anybody trying to say that this isn't happening?
[02:21:49.159 --> 02:21:50.200]  Is completely out of it.
[02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:51.861]  This is absolutely happening.
[02:21:51.881 --> 02:21:52.602]  The purge is on.
[02:21:52.902 --> 02:21:54.123]  They're trying to silence our voices.
[02:21:54.443 --> 02:21:57.306]  And my main question for you, Gary, is why?
[02:21:57.846 --> 02:22:06.834]  What is coming up that is so dangerous for America that they have to silence all of our voices in advance?
[02:22:07.174 --> 02:22:08.475]  What do you think is coming up, Gary?
[02:22:09.816 --> 02:22:12.718]  Well, Mike, we got the 2018 midterm elections coming up.
[02:22:13.159 --> 02:22:17.102]  And the last thing that YouTube, that Google, that Facebook
[02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:18.100]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:40.471]  They don't want to be blamed again for some sort of election hacking.
[02:22:41.331 --> 02:22:44.973]  And because the egg was on their face, everyone was pointing the finger at them.
[02:22:45.593 --> 02:22:49.054]  So I think that's one thing that's because of the election.
[02:22:49.074 --> 02:22:50.675]  They do not want to have a repeat of that.
[02:22:51.579 --> 02:23:02.127]  You're talking about the midterm elections coming up, and I get that, and your audio is kind of cutting out there a little bit, sorry for me interrupting, but it seems like to me, though, there's got to be something bigger than that.
[02:23:02.147 --> 02:23:09.073]  I mean, just the midterm elections, granted, that's crucial, and if they win, you know, the House, then they will impeach Trump.
[02:23:09.313 --> 02:23:18.020]  And if they impeach Trump, they think maybe they can win the 2020 presidency, and then they will use that to take away the guns, you know, take away our firearms and install another
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:21.522]  Well, I mean, you look at the long goal of the New World Order.
[02:23:21.542 --> 02:23:24.505]  I mean, they want to turn America into a third world despot.
[02:23:24.525 --> 02:23:26.206]  They want us all to be subservient to their
[02:23:37.279 --> 02:23:37.659]  I don't
[02:23:56.331 --> 02:23:57.932]  Well, that's the thing, yeah.
[02:23:58.032 --> 02:24:00.794]  And they can only take our guns if we agree to give them up.
[02:24:01.194 --> 02:24:03.416]  Because they can't take them by force.
[02:24:03.556 --> 02:24:08.059]  There are too many armed Americans, there are too many people who will defend their country.
[02:24:08.239 --> 02:24:08.780]  Thank God.
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.561]  And I'm one of them, and you're one of them, I know.
[02:24:10.881 --> 02:24:17.126]  But they have to get people to voluntarily surrender their Second Amendment rights.
[02:24:17.826 --> 02:24:23.750]  And in order to do that, it seems like they're going to have to have some bigger false flag than what we've ever seen in history.
[02:24:24.051 --> 02:24:24.711]  And that's the only way.
[02:24:24.751 --> 02:24:25.572]  How are you going to convince
[02:24:26.332 --> 02:24:36.042]  Well, look, a larger false flag would be an absolutely terrifying thing.
[02:24:36.082 --> 02:24:39.325]  We've seen multiple across the last decade.
[02:24:39.686 --> 02:24:42.108]  So we don't want to... I personally would hate to see something like that.
[02:24:42.308 --> 02:24:42.869]  Right, me too.
[02:24:44.648 --> 02:24:49.111]  Here's the bigger problem, is that we got the suppression of speech.
[02:24:49.792 --> 02:24:57.337]  And speech is the only mechanism by which we can communicate and have an effective dialogue, debate, and then have effective change across the country.
[02:24:59.799 --> 02:25:01.740]  They don't want you to be part of the conversation.
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:09.346]  They want to bash you on the head, stick duct tape over your mouth, and say, you're a bully, so we're going to bully you into silence.
[02:25:09.386 --> 02:25:10.667]  That's what the left does today.
[02:25:11.783 --> 02:25:22.673]  Well, unfortunately, the consequences of that, when they shut off that release valve of people being able to speak and have dialogue, well, the consequence of that is revolution.
[02:25:22.693 --> 02:25:23.434]  It's civil war.
[02:25:23.915 --> 02:25:28.279]  So I think that that's the unintended consequence of their
[02:25:29.053 --> 02:25:34.576]  Slow kill of our speech, and if they want to continue to try to take guns away, that's just stupid.
[02:25:34.856 --> 02:25:37.757]  There's so many guns in this country, they can't come and take them all away.
[02:25:37.777 --> 02:25:42.059]  That's a very insightful term that you use, the slow kill of our speech.
[02:25:42.119 --> 02:25:45.801]  Actually, it's kind of an accelerated rapid kill at the moment, but I get what you're saying.
[02:25:45.821 --> 02:25:47.862]  I'll tell you what, let's take a caller, Gary.
[02:25:48.442 --> 02:25:51.244]  We've got Hotshot from California calling in.
[02:25:51.404 --> 02:25:52.284]  Thank you for holding.
[02:25:52.584 --> 02:25:54.885]  You're on with Mike Adams here and Gary Franchi.
[02:25:54.905 --> 02:25:56.806]  You can pose a question to either one of us or both.
[02:25:57.186 --> 02:25:57.987]  What's your question?
[02:25:58.027 --> 02:25:58.267]  Go ahead.
[02:25:58.660 --> 02:25:59.180]  Hello, you guys.
[02:25:59.441 --> 02:26:00.541]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:26:00.622 --> 02:26:03.864]  I'd like to talk about... Gary's talking about the targeted individuals.
[02:26:04.504 --> 02:26:05.065]  That's true.
[02:26:05.125 --> 02:26:05.685]  That's happening.
[02:26:05.745 --> 02:26:08.287]  It's happening down to the simple man level.
[02:26:08.688 --> 02:26:14.892]  If you have a voice and you're speaking out and you're being effective, they're going to put a thumb on you and hold you down.
[02:26:15.093 --> 02:26:16.934]  It's happening to everybody across the board.
[02:26:17.514 --> 02:26:25.701]  I'd like to shine some light on the Florida incident and his remarks saying he was hearing voices, okay?
[02:26:26.377 --> 02:26:27.397]  You're talking about Nicholas Cruz.
[02:26:27.878 --> 02:26:28.198]  Correct.
[02:26:28.298 --> 02:26:28.738]  Yes, I am.
[02:26:28.778 --> 02:26:29.158]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:26:29.178 --> 02:26:31.939]  I'm trying to get that in under there so we don't get censored.
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:33.580]  Right.
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:35.501]  You know how the censorship keywords work.
[02:26:35.541 --> 02:26:35.981]  Go ahead, though.
[02:26:36.421 --> 02:26:36.841]  Correct.
[02:26:37.602 --> 02:26:43.504]  So, if you were to dig deeper into that, there's such thing as called offensive information warfare.
[02:26:43.965 --> 02:26:47.006]  Offensive information warfare was used in the first Desert Storm.
[02:26:48.066 --> 02:26:51.968]  It's said that we got the Iraqis to lay down their guns with the voice of God weapon.
[02:26:52.597 --> 02:27:03.673]  Now, you put somebody on psychotropics and you use neuro-linguistic programming and the Voice of God weapon, you can pretty much program to do anything, much like a Manchurian candidate.
[02:27:04.039 --> 02:27:08.061]  But they're saying that, you know, the left is saying that Trump is the Manchurian candidate.
[02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:09.461]  How insane is that?
[02:27:09.481 --> 02:27:13.043]  I mean, when you say it, caller, I apologize, I don't even know your name.
[02:27:13.303 --> 02:27:15.584]  When you say it, they're going to say you're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:27:15.964 --> 02:27:19.306]  But when they say Trump is a Manchurian candidate, that's not a conspiracy theory.
[02:27:19.686 --> 02:27:19.966]  You see?
[02:27:19.986 --> 02:27:22.147]  Sure, I understand the double standard.
[02:27:22.587 --> 02:27:25.668]  We've just got to stick to our program and work it from within.
[02:27:26.349 --> 02:27:27.589]  You take, for example, the U.S.
[02:27:27.729 --> 02:27:28.970]  Embassy attack in Cuba.
[02:27:29.050 --> 02:27:31.831]  Twenty-four individuals with brain abnormalities.
[02:27:32.284 --> 02:27:37.126]  There's four technologies out under offensive information warfare.
[02:27:37.646 --> 02:27:40.187]  They could have easily been hit with signals technology.
[02:27:40.207 --> 02:27:41.168]  You're aware of this, Mike?
[02:27:41.508 --> 02:27:42.028]  Absolutely.
[02:27:42.348 --> 02:27:44.169]  And let's get Gary's response on this.
[02:27:44.189 --> 02:27:45.310]  We've only got about a minute left.
[02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.430]  Go ahead, Gary.
[02:27:46.770 --> 02:27:48.511]  What's your response to what the caller is saying?
[02:27:49.542 --> 02:27:54.545]  Well, I mean, information technology, warfare, I mean, this is what we're experiencing all across the country.
[02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.085]  I mean, it's happening in real time.
[02:27:56.105 --> 02:28:02.028]  We have to censor ourselves by not even saying keywords in video streams.
[02:28:02.508 --> 02:28:08.411]  I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous what's happening, but in the Manchurian candidate sense of things, the hypocrisy is clear.
[02:28:08.832 --> 02:28:13.694]  You know, you can have one, Trump can be the Manchurian candidate, or Cruz could be the Manchurian candidate, you know,
[02:28:14.611 --> 02:28:15.792]  Pick the narrative of the day.
[02:28:16.032 --> 02:28:17.553]  The bottom line is they're censoring us.
[02:28:17.573 --> 02:28:18.794]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:28:19.094 --> 02:28:20.875]  We cannot let that continue.
[02:28:20.955 --> 02:28:21.735]  It's absolutely true.
[02:28:21.756 --> 02:28:24.257]  I thank you for your call, Hot Shot from California.
[02:28:24.397 --> 02:28:28.760]  Very well spoken and some good points there for all of us to consider.
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:30.521]  Gary, I also want to thank you for joining us.
[02:28:30.541 --> 02:28:32.963]  Your website is nextnewsnetwork.com.
[02:28:33.103 --> 02:28:33.543]  Is that correct?
[02:28:34.690 --> 02:28:35.911]  Yeah, nextnewsnetwork.com.
[02:28:35.931 --> 02:28:39.092]  You can find us at youtube.com slash nextnewsnetwork for now.
[02:28:39.453 --> 02:28:41.794]  Yeah, we're going to censor you next.
[02:28:41.854 --> 02:28:44.636]  Once you appear on this show, you're targeted for termination, Gary.
[02:28:45.256 --> 02:28:46.877]  That's what happened to me.
[02:28:47.677 --> 02:28:48.558]  The target's big.
[02:28:48.978 --> 02:28:49.658]  All right, all right.
[02:28:49.959 --> 02:28:52.660]  Well, thanks for being on today, Gary, and thank you for joining us.
[02:28:52.700 --> 02:28:54.081]  We'll be back after this break with more.
[02:28:54.101 --> 02:28:58.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams filling in today.
[02:29:02.321 --> 02:29:09.987]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarslife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:29:10.868 --> 02:29:14.911]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:29:15.431 --> 02:29:17.773]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:29:18.573 --> 02:29:21.696]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:29:23.188 --> 02:29:35.336]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:29:36.037 --> 02:29:51.087]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.

[02:31:12.165 --> 02:31:13.165]  Tell us about that, Kit.
[02:31:13.385 --> 02:31:20.770]  Spike himself just sought to make the absolute best rifle out there that people could afford.
[02:31:21.611 --> 02:31:26.354]  And that's why Pipe Hitters Union has actually started doing a collaboration with us as well.
[02:31:26.654 --> 02:31:28.415]  We wanted to put out a line of rifles.
[02:31:28.916 --> 02:31:31.898]  We wanted rifles that were high quality,
[02:31:32.538 --> 02:31:36.681]  That were combat rated that we could like put our name on and really stand behind.
[02:31:36.821 --> 02:31:42.305]  So we looked around at quite a few companies and to be quite honest, it was an easy decision to make.
[02:31:42.665 --> 02:31:46.128]  Spikes Tactical is a small family owned business.
[02:31:46.508 --> 02:31:47.769]  They stand behind their products.
[02:31:48.009 --> 02:31:50.591]  As Kit said, it's a no BS lifetime guarantee.
[02:31:50.631 --> 02:31:54.073]  If you have a problem with your gun, they will fix the problem.
[02:31:54.133 --> 02:31:56.415]  And that is huge in today's age.
[02:31:56.695 --> 02:32:00.598]  So you've got a very high end rifle at a very affordable price.
[02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:04.661]  We're also 100% American-made.
[02:32:04.841 --> 02:32:07.383]  They are strong supporters of the Second Amendment.
[02:32:07.523 --> 02:32:09.805]  They are strong supporters of the military.
[02:32:09.885 --> 02:32:11.086]  Spike gives back a lot.
[02:32:11.146 --> 02:32:15.270]  Well, I know the listeners are big fans already of Spike Tactical and the fact you're supporting us.

[02:32:58.874 --> 02:33:01.775]  That's promo code Alex at SpikesTactical.com.
[02:33:06.858 --> 02:33:09.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.656 --> 02:33:15.877]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:15.957 --> 02:33:18.019]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:32.276 --> 02:33:34.237]  The assault on free speech is on.
[02:33:34.557 --> 02:33:42.080]  They're trying to exterminate independent voices and independent media from the space, the place of public discussion.
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:48.803]  The internet is being cleansed, you might say, cleansed of the ability to think, the ability to question.
[02:33:48.823 --> 02:33:49.683]  I mean, think about it.
[02:33:49.723 --> 02:33:59.487]  YouTube took my channel down, but they leave channels up that have violence and, you know, abusing animals and live shootings and murder and everything.
[02:33:59.528 --> 02:34:00.168]  That's no problem.
[02:34:00.788 --> 02:34:06.970]  But someone like me who asks a few important questions about the left-wing agenda, no, you get censored.
[02:34:07.010 --> 02:34:09.711]  So there are powerful actions that you can take right now.
[02:34:09.731 --> 02:34:11.332]  I'm going to mention those.
[02:34:11.592 --> 02:34:18.174]  I'm just going to repeat, too, that this is a good time to call your Capitol switchboard today at 202-224-3121 and talk to your lawmakers and demand antitrust action.
[02:34:24.076 --> 02:34:30.578]  Against these tech giants who are unfairly singling people out for politically biased censorship.
[02:34:31.378 --> 02:34:34.699]  Another thing you can do is you can tweet out the at YouTube team.
[02:34:34.719 --> 02:34:44.942]  This is just at YouTube is the Twitter handle and demand that they stop censoring Paul Joseph Watson and InfoWars and Natural News and everybody else that they're censoring.
[02:34:45.973 --> 02:34:51.855]  I'm also launching a new free speech video aggregation site.
[02:34:51.915 --> 02:34:53.915]  I've already spoken with Alex about this.
[02:34:53.975 --> 02:34:55.616]  He fully supports the operation.
[02:34:55.876 --> 02:34:58.237]  We're going to be carrying the InfoWars videos.
[02:34:58.597 --> 02:35:02.058]  I'll be talking to Rob Dew and Paul Joseph Watson, getting all that coordinated.
[02:35:02.358 --> 02:35:08.380]  And that site, which is just a teaser right now, but it's launching later this year, is called Real.Video.
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:10.180]  It's Real.Video.
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:11.141]  Completely ad-free.
[02:35:11.181 --> 02:35:12.481]  This is not a commercial plug.
[02:35:13.141 --> 02:35:15.222]  It's a place where our free speech rights
[02:35:15.902 --> 02:35:16.683]  We'll be protected.
[02:35:17.263 --> 02:35:25.869]  It's a video distribution system for people like Jim Hoft and Gary Franchi and Paul Joseph Watson and David Knight and Alex Jones and myself.
[02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:29.272]  And that site, you can register there now just to get informed.
[02:35:29.312 --> 02:35:30.393]  It's called Real.Video.
[02:35:30.433 --> 02:35:34.336]  We grabbed that premium domain name last week as part of this operation.
[02:35:34.916 --> 02:35:36.638]  And I'm working with peer-to-peer programmers.
[02:35:37.558 --> 02:35:43.923]  That does not, by the way, compete with bitshoot.com or d.tube or Steemit or anything like that.
[02:35:43.963 --> 02:35:48.206]  It actually works alongside them in many ways, as you'll soon see.
[02:35:48.567 --> 02:35:53.891]  And by the way, I fully support all of those peer-to-peer video sites and Steem and Steemit.com.
[02:35:54.371 --> 02:35:55.352]  Doing great work.
[02:35:55.872 --> 02:35:59.575]  I think Alex has already given everybody permission to upload and share his videos.
[02:36:00.768 --> 02:36:06.172]  You can also, I want to encourage you to type your favorite website URLs directly into your browser.
[02:36:06.992 --> 02:36:12.036]  Don't depend on Facebook to spoon feed you biased disinformation.
[02:36:12.416 --> 02:36:15.578]  Don't even depend on, let's say, Reddit to give you a feed.
[02:36:16.099 --> 02:36:21.082]  You should go to the websites that you support, where you know the truth reigns supreme.
[02:36:21.102 --> 02:36:26.766]  You know, just type in InfoWars.com, just type in NaturalNews.com, just go directly to the websites.
[02:36:27.247 --> 02:36:30.029]  Don't depend on somebody else to curate your content.
[02:36:30.899 --> 02:36:35.465]  Because then you're not going to get real information if you do that.
[02:36:36.126 --> 02:36:39.831]  The other thing is, walk away from Facebook, YouTube, and Google.
[02:36:40.799 --> 02:36:44.960]  Walk away from these biased, anti-American services.
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:45.940]  Stop using Facebook.
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:46.721]  It wastes your time.
[02:36:46.961 --> 02:36:47.961]  It invades your privacy.
[02:36:48.301 --> 02:36:49.141]  Stop using Google.
[02:36:49.221 --> 02:36:51.862]  Use DuckDuckGo instead or some other alternative search engine.
[02:36:52.582 --> 02:36:53.583]  Stop using YouTube.
[02:36:53.843 --> 02:36:58.904]  You know, I mentioned BitChute.com and D.Tube are sort of peer-to-peer.
[02:36:58.964 --> 02:37:00.845]  One of them, I think, is blockchain-powered.
[02:37:00.865 --> 02:37:01.505]  D.Tube is.
[02:37:02.225 --> 02:37:08.312]  These are sort of up-and-coming, the alternative replacements for YouTube, and I encourage you to use those sites.
[02:37:08.713 --> 02:37:17.303]  You've got to stop allowing the technocracy to control your attention, to control what information you're getting.
[02:37:17.964 --> 02:37:20.747]  And lastly, start publishing your own content.
[02:37:21.599 --> 02:37:22.220]  Join the fight.
[02:37:22.841 --> 02:37:26.125]  Start a blog, start a podcast, film videos.
[02:37:26.505 --> 02:37:36.217]  I mean, the guy we just interviewed, Gary Franchi, you know, a few years ago, he was just, he just had like a microphone and a camera and a curtain, you know, and he was doing, he was doing free speech videos.
[02:37:36.758 --> 02:37:40.662]  And look at him now, you know, he's all professional, he's got a huge animated backdrop and everything.
[02:37:41.503 --> 02:37:42.424]  And it's the same way here.
[02:37:42.444 --> 02:37:47.949]  I mean, Alex Jones started out as, like, a guy with a desk and a microphone and, like, a computer monitor behind him.
[02:37:48.609 --> 02:37:51.212]  And now it's a full-on world-class operation here.
[02:37:51.612 --> 02:37:55.835]  You can start small and you can join these Liberty Voices.
[02:37:56.596 --> 02:37:58.257]  And it is crucial that you do so.
[02:37:58.597 --> 02:38:02.319]  This is not about, you know, me or Alex or any one person.
[02:38:02.779 --> 02:38:11.364]  This is about the community of people who love freedom, who love liberty, who love just the divine right to think for yourself.
[02:38:12.124 --> 02:38:22.629]  The right to express your point of view without being pummeled, and bludgeoned, and censored, and silenced, and insulted, and subjected to endless lawsuits like what's happening to Alex right now.
[02:38:23.010 --> 02:38:23.510]  It's insane.
[02:38:23.810 --> 02:38:25.111]  So join the fight.
[02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:31.353]  Now, I'm going to take some more calls in this segment, and also, I just want to tease this one more time.
[02:38:31.373 --> 02:38:38.818]  I am going to talk about, in the last segment here, this recycling of aborted babies into the food supply.
[02:38:39.198 --> 02:38:40.679]  That is not a misstatement.
[02:38:41.379 --> 02:38:42.520]  This is factual.
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:43.280]  It is true.
[02:38:43.420 --> 02:38:49.324]  I'm going to connect the dots for you here, so you don't want to miss that segment here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:49.704 --> 02:38:53.526]  The stuff that we have to talk about is so mind-numbing.
[02:38:55.310 --> 02:38:56.830]  It's atrocious, it's horrifying.
[02:38:57.190 --> 02:38:57.950]  We're gonna get to that.
[02:38:58.030 --> 02:39:08.692]  You need to know that the food that you're eating and the food being fed to your children in the schools is being grown on, quote, fertilizer that consists of ground-up, dead, aborted babies, okay?
[02:39:08.992 --> 02:39:09.652]  That is true.
[02:39:10.133 --> 02:39:10.893]  We're gonna get to that.
[02:39:11.533 --> 02:39:15.153]  And I almost couldn't touch the subject, so I've been putting it off.
[02:39:16.034 --> 02:39:18.474]  We're gonna talk to Lauren in California.
[02:39:18.554 --> 02:39:19.574]  Thank you for calling, Lauren.
[02:39:19.594 --> 02:39:21.714]  You're live on the air with The Health Ranger.
[02:39:22.175 --> 02:39:22.535]  Thank you.
[02:39:22.715 --> 02:39:24.335]  What's your question or comment?
[02:39:24.355 --> 02:39:24.635]  Go ahead.
[02:39:26.141 --> 02:39:27.242]  Hey Mike, it's great to be on with you.
[02:39:27.262 --> 02:39:27.922]  I'm a huge fan.
[02:39:27.942 --> 02:39:28.983]  Good to hear you again.
[02:39:29.263 --> 02:39:29.583]  Thank you.
[02:39:29.663 --> 02:39:34.225]  And again, I just wanted to talk about this intensification of this censorship.
[02:39:34.266 --> 02:39:35.306]  It's just, it's crazy.
[02:39:35.826 --> 02:39:45.532]  And it's almost, you know, it's like 1984 and it seems to me like they're at the point they just want to go full force with it and then just act like nothing's happening until enough time passes, you know, and sweeps under the carpet.
[02:39:45.792 --> 02:39:45.952]  Right.
[02:39:46.914 --> 02:39:48.615]  So we need to take action right now.
[02:39:48.635 --> 02:39:50.276]  We need to do everything we can.
[02:39:50.316 --> 02:39:52.957]  And just like you were saying, start small.
[02:39:53.518 --> 02:39:54.338]  Do whatever you can.
[02:39:54.958 --> 02:39:57.300]  Me, personally, I live in California.
[02:39:57.340 --> 02:39:58.760]  I own my own business.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:00.401]  I listen to InfoWars daily.
[02:40:00.901 --> 02:40:04.303]  And I follow Mike Cernovich, you, everybody else.
[02:40:04.543 --> 02:40:09.686]  And what I did was I started a website called InfoWarsOutpost.com.
[02:40:09.886 --> 02:40:13.808]  And I was fortunate enough to get on air the other day and discuss it with Owen.
[02:40:14.381 --> 02:40:15.442]  And about the launch of it.
[02:40:15.482 --> 02:40:24.408]  And ever since I was on, actually, I've had a lot of contact and been flooded with people all over the country, very interested, trying to either find an outpost or either become an outpost.
[02:40:24.448 --> 02:40:27.329]  So I'm very excited about the outcome about that.
[02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:28.510]  That's awesome, Lauren.
[02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:33.233]  So are you just sort of, like, curating and posting the top videos or top articles?
[02:40:33.293 --> 02:40:35.375]  Or what are you gathering there, really?
[02:40:35.415 --> 02:40:35.975]  What's the topic?
[02:40:36.926 --> 02:40:50.976]  Basically, the outpost is just, if you own or manage an establishment or business, it could be anything, you know, an art shop, a coffee shop, a restaurant, anything that has TV playing or a monitor playing, you know, instead of having CNN playing or
[02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:53.721]  You know, bogus mainstream stuff playing.
[02:40:53.781 --> 02:40:54.722]  Have InfoWars playing.
[02:40:54.742 --> 02:40:55.703]  Have the broadcast playing.
[02:40:55.723 --> 02:40:55.883]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:55.923 --> 02:40:57.904]  And then that's how you earn outposts.
[02:40:58.004 --> 02:41:01.246]  And the website is just a hub for everybody who wants to be part of it.
[02:41:01.647 --> 02:41:08.251]  So you're encouraging these retail establishments to syndicate, essentially, and rebroadcast InfoWars content?
[02:41:09.132 --> 02:41:09.712]  Yeah, just play it.
[02:41:09.732 --> 02:41:10.032]  Oh, fantastic.
[02:41:10.052 --> 02:41:11.253]  And then people can look it up on their phone.
[02:41:11.273 --> 02:41:17.197]  I'm actually trying to develop an app right now, because ever since I was on the other day, a bunch of people have been contacting me trying to find them.
[02:41:17.217 --> 02:41:19.979]  So I'm trying to work on an app so it's simpler and people can go on their phone
[02:41:20.347 --> 02:41:27.290]  And open it up and go to InfoWarsOutpost.com and find an outpost in their city, in their town, and go to lunch and sit down and the broadcast will be there.
[02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:28.510]  Very cool.
[02:41:28.810 --> 02:41:29.130]  Wow.
[02:41:29.891 --> 02:41:31.071]  I like the way you're thinking, Loren.
[02:41:31.091 --> 02:41:31.651]  That's awesome.
[02:41:31.671 --> 02:41:32.812]  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you there.
[02:41:33.772 --> 02:41:35.593]  What you're doing is exactly what needs to be done.
[02:41:35.633 --> 02:41:36.413]  You did it on your own.
[02:41:36.473 --> 02:41:37.474]  It's kind of like a networking.
[02:41:37.514 --> 02:41:41.855]  It's almost a local level, peer-to-peer, truth warrior type of activity.
[02:41:42.336 --> 02:41:43.116]  Rock on, man.
[02:41:43.196 --> 02:41:43.756]  Good job.
[02:41:44.236 --> 02:41:45.257]  And thank you for your call.
[02:41:45.337 --> 02:41:48.078]  It's InfoWarsOutpost.com, I believe was that domain name.
[02:41:48.718 --> 02:41:51.340]  Let's take a call from Blake in Michigan.
[02:41:52.121 --> 02:41:55.223]  Blake, we don't have much time, but go ahead with your question.
[02:41:55.243 --> 02:41:57.806]  I might have to answer it on the other side of this break, but go ahead, Blake.
[02:41:59.047 --> 02:41:59.887]  Hey, how you doing, Mike?
[02:41:59.987 --> 02:42:00.628]  I'm doing good, man.
[02:42:00.648 --> 02:42:01.208]  Thanks for calling.
[02:42:02.049 --> 02:42:03.350]  I just wanted to call in.
[02:42:03.490 --> 02:42:11.377]  I work very closely with Facebook, Google, and YouTube, and I think that every single person should get off the platform, stop watching cable.
[02:42:11.657 --> 02:42:15.360]  The only way that they're making money is once you see those ads.
[02:42:16.198 --> 02:42:21.882]  Every time you click on an ad, every single time you see something on television, that's how they're making all of their money.
[02:42:22.443 --> 02:42:25.385]  People say, oh, I'm watching the Super Bowl, I just want to watch the ad.
[02:42:25.866 --> 02:42:31.290]  Well, duh, that's where they're getting all their money from is when your TV's on and that ad's playing.
[02:42:31.772 --> 02:42:33.674]  Blake, we gotta go to break here.
[02:42:34.034 --> 02:42:35.895]  Your points are very well taken.
[02:42:36.596 --> 02:42:37.477]  Stay on the line with us.
[02:42:37.617 --> 02:42:42.821]  I'd like to ask you a question on the other side of this break, but what you said so far is right on target.
[02:42:43.101 --> 02:42:48.125]  You're listening to Mike Adams filling in today for Alex Jones here at Infowars.com.
[02:42:48.345 --> 02:42:50.007]  We'll be right back after this break.
[02:42:50.067 --> 02:42:51.468]  Thanks for listening or watching.
[02:42:51.488 --> 02:42:52.689]  A lot more ahead.
[02:43:02.708 --> 02:43:11.712]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:11.792 --> 02:43:20.035]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:20.195 --> 02:43:24.897]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:25.077 --> 02:43:31.720]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:38.944]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:39.044 --> 02:43:40.845]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[02:43:40.945 --> 02:43:45.907]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:46.067 --> 02:43:50.409]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.549 --> 02:43:53.751]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:53.931 --> 02:44:00.078]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:44:00.238 --> 02:44:01.900]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:44:05.091 --> 02:44:06.733]  If you don't buy the products, we're not here.
[02:44:07.334 --> 02:44:09.236]  And these are products you really need.
[02:44:09.456 --> 02:44:14.301]  We go out and research the market, what's popular, what people want, what people like, what works.
[02:44:14.461 --> 02:44:16.744]  We then go to the top organic producers in the country.
[02:44:16.764 --> 02:44:18.786]  We've got four different companies that make our products.
[02:44:18.866 --> 02:44:21.169]  We've got 60-something different supplements now.
[02:44:21.249 --> 02:44:25.273]  And we say, who makes the strongest turmeric product on the market?
[02:44:25.934 --> 02:44:27.935]  And they say, from the test, it's this one.
[02:44:28.335 --> 02:44:30.436]  But we only make what people ask us to make.
[02:44:30.556 --> 02:44:31.336]  We make this one.
[02:44:31.396 --> 02:44:38.738]  It's got 100 milligrams of curcumin, but it's about 70%—this is a talk we had—concentrated curcumin in those milligrams.
[02:44:38.818 --> 02:44:40.099]  And they go, but the industry standard's about 3%.
[02:44:40.199 --> 02:44:43.980]  We went out and found 95% curcuminoid.
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:46.841]  That's just one ingredient in Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:44:46.861 --> 02:44:52.163]  And when I say ultimate, it is the most powerful concentrated that we can find.
[02:44:52.463 --> 02:44:57.945]  Somebody may have something stronger, but when I tell you it's the strongest, it's the strongest we can find.
[02:44:58.145 --> 02:44:59.665]  It's also the most expensive for us.
[02:44:59.785 --> 02:45:02.006]  They're selling turmeric for 50, 60 bucks.
[02:45:02.086 --> 02:45:04.587]  It's 3% and got maybe 50 milligrams in it.
[02:45:04.607 --> 02:45:05.867]  A lot of the competition, okay?
[02:45:06.107 --> 02:45:09.428]  So that's what all the products are like, okay?
[02:45:09.468 --> 02:45:10.468]  My brain works like this.
[02:45:10.968 --> 02:45:12.349]  This melatonin is $19.95.
[02:45:12.549 --> 02:45:13.429]  It's 3 milligrams.
[02:45:13.709 --> 02:45:15.530]  How much does melatonin cost?
[02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:18.130]  Maybe 30, 40 cents for that dose.
[02:45:18.250 --> 02:45:19.251]  And the bottle costs 50 cents.
[02:45:19.311 --> 02:45:19.911]  I'm like, okay.
[02:45:20.031 --> 02:45:28.379]  Well, I talk to the scientists and the developers and I say, can we stick L-tryptophan with the melatonin, with the valerian root, with the lemon balm, with the nego?
[02:45:28.399 --> 02:45:29.780]  Yeah, you can do all that very safely.
[02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:30.901]  And how much will all that cost?
[02:45:31.422 --> 02:45:32.202]  It'll cost you $5.
[02:45:32.863 --> 02:45:34.344]  Nobody puts that much stuff in one of these.
[02:45:34.544 --> 02:45:37.007]  I'm putting $5 in it and I'm going to sell it for $19.95.
[02:45:37.447 --> 02:45:42.492]  What whacked out world are you going to sit there and put 50 cents in something and sell it for $19.95?
[02:45:44.033 --> 02:45:48.514]  So I'm marking this stuff up, but I'm telling you folks, it's crazy how the industry works.
[02:45:48.874 --> 02:45:50.195]  And that's why they go and they test our stuff.
[02:45:50.215 --> 02:45:54.136]  They go, well, this is the top rated vitamin B12, but Jones, this is Jones's.
[02:45:54.516 --> 02:45:57.437]  It is pure vitamin B12, like he says, but this one's the best.
[02:45:57.617 --> 02:45:59.177]  And then it's the one we're private labeled.
[02:45:59.217 --> 02:46:01.358]  So that's how this works, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:01.438 --> 02:46:02.678]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:46:02.718 --> 02:46:04.398]  You're going to get supplements that are amazing.
[02:46:04.418 --> 02:46:05.779]  You're going to get products that are incredible.
[02:46:05.799 --> 02:46:10.320]  And you're going to get products that help you and your family while standing against the globalist and knowing
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:23.628]  That they hate us so much, they want to destroy us so bad, they spend so much time coming after us and lying about us and trying to wreck our lives, because we know who they are, and when you breathe life into us and you spread the articles and the videos, it changes the whole world.
[02:46:24.449 --> 02:46:29.592]  And I want to expand on their face, because let me tell you something, if we shrink, they're going to lay it on even more.
[02:46:29.652 --> 02:46:33.854]  We've got to grow, we've got to show them we're growing, and we've got to get stronger.
[02:46:33.874 --> 02:46:34.735]  And by the way, we are.
[02:46:35.255 --> 02:46:38.217]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger, to give you another Nietzsche quote.
[02:46:40.186 --> 02:46:41.167]  But it's because of you.
[02:46:41.488 --> 02:46:42.128]  It's because of you.
[02:46:42.148 --> 02:46:54.961]  So I salute you, I thank you, I appreciate you, and I just want to ask you to just remember us in your prayers and remember the products and remember these are great products for you and your family and they're essential to fund the operation.
[02:46:54.981 --> 02:46:55.842]  It's a 360 win.
[02:46:56.143 --> 02:46:58.725]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:06.295 --> 02:47:10.817]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.342 --> 02:47:27.766]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:33.086 --> 02:47:37.770]  We've got some horrifying true news for you in this segment coming up.
[02:47:38.330 --> 02:47:51.380]  But first I want to continue our call with Blake who works for an ad agency and in the last segment he was advising us to stop using Facebook and YouTube and Google, which happens to align with my advice as well.
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:54.002]  But Blake, I wanted to keep you over because it seems like you were on a roll.
[02:47:54.022 --> 02:47:54.943]  What else did you want to add?
[02:47:57.465 --> 02:48:02.729]  I caution people to look at this
[02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:24.930]  On both sides of the coin, because if we fold our hand and everybody pulls out of these big sites, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, that opens up a void for something else that could be put in place that may not allow us to have the freedoms that we currently have on these networks that we're currently on, which are being very, you know, limited and put a lid on.
[02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:26.792]  But I mean, I don't know.
[02:48:26.932 --> 02:48:28.193]  I just I feel like
[02:48:29.460 --> 02:48:44.391]  Everybody needs to wake up and stop drinking the fluoride, start eating organic, and really need to get together with your local community to set up maybe a time for everybody to get together and actually really reconnect.
[02:48:45.410 --> 02:48:47.811]  We're being viewed as just a number on a computer.
[02:48:47.851 --> 02:48:50.192]  We're being viewed as a follower or a click.
[02:48:50.592 --> 02:48:56.475]  We're not even being viewed as real people anymore by all of these multinational corporations.
[02:48:56.755 --> 02:48:59.876]  You're absolutely right, Blake, and I really appreciate your call.
[02:48:59.916 --> 02:49:03.258]  I think what you're getting to is that the key is decentralization.
[02:49:03.778 --> 02:49:10.381]  When we hand our power over to a central video service, whether it's YouTube or some other video service that's centrally controlled,
[02:49:11.041 --> 02:49:13.305]  Then we give up our autonomy.
[02:49:13.325 --> 02:49:14.967]  We give up our individuality.
[02:49:15.007 --> 02:49:16.790]  It's really about decentralization.
[02:49:17.311 --> 02:49:21.117]  Peer-to-peer networks, I believe, are the future of information.
[02:49:21.137 --> 02:49:24.462]  That's why I'm working in this realm as well with Real.Video.
[02:49:25.453 --> 02:49:26.554]  So I thank you for your call.
[02:49:27.194 --> 02:49:28.975]  We've got a lot more to cover here in this segment.
[02:49:28.995 --> 02:49:30.976]  I can't believe almost three hours has gone by.
[02:49:30.996 --> 02:49:32.637]  I really appreciate you tuning in.
[02:49:33.337 --> 02:49:39.380]  And if you want me back as a guest host, I mean, I have to run my own operation as well, so I can't be here that often.
[02:49:39.821 --> 02:49:43.883]  But if you want me back, let InfoWars know that you've enjoyed this broadcast so far.
[02:49:44.363 --> 02:49:49.446]  So far, there's even more coming, and I'd be happy to continue to join this fight for liberty.
[02:49:50.046 --> 02:49:54.649]  In conjunction with the Infowars operation, which, as I said, is a very professional operation.
[02:49:54.669 --> 02:49:55.870]  They're doing amazing work here.
[02:49:56.430 --> 02:49:58.652]  Now, we're going to change topics here and roll a video.
[02:49:59.652 --> 02:50:12.201]  This video is by... It features Julius Malema, who is apparently one of the communist leaders of a South African movement to not just take the property of all white people, but murder them.
[02:50:12.221 --> 02:50:13.262]  It's a short segment.
[02:50:13.282 --> 02:50:13.902]  Go ahead and roll that.
[02:50:13.922 --> 02:50:14.382]  We'll comment.
[02:50:20.467 --> 02:50:24.048]  Who is a DA member and a leader?
[02:50:26.328 --> 02:50:26.548]  Why?
[02:50:26.949 --> 02:50:33.250]  Because the mayor of DA in PE is a white man.
[02:50:34.530 --> 02:50:40.092]  So these people, when you want to hit them hard, go after a white man.
[02:50:40.112 --> 02:50:46.153]  They feel a terrible pain because you have touched a white man.
[02:50:47.898 --> 02:50:49.780]  Because you want a white man?
[02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:51.201]  What did he say there right at the end?
[02:50:51.261 --> 02:50:56.986]  He was making like machete sign like, you know, machete chopping signs.
[02:50:57.787 --> 02:50:59.789]  That is some scary video.
[02:50:59.869 --> 02:51:03.332]  It's kind of like because there were abuses.
[02:51:04.295 --> 02:51:04.455]  Yeah.
[02:51:19.443 --> 02:51:26.127]  And now, as I promised, probably the most horrifying news of the day, which really is a strong segue from that.
[02:51:26.227 --> 02:51:34.491]  It talks about the culture of death and destruction and almost kind of a demonic anti-life Satanism of the left.
[02:51:34.811 --> 02:51:38.833]  They have actually engineered a way, that I'm going to describe here, for you to eat your dead.
[02:51:39.254 --> 02:51:41.175]  For you to eat your dead babies.
[02:51:41.655 --> 02:51:43.556]  It is happening right now, you can't even believe it.
[02:51:43.576 --> 02:51:45.057]  We're going to start with
[02:51:45.928 --> 02:51:56.432]  This story about a recycling technology to eat your dead who have been bio-cremated, kind of like right out of The Matrix.
[02:51:57.012 --> 02:52:09.077]  There is a company in Canada, it's in a city called Smith Falls, and it uses a bio-cremation technology that dissolves the dead, and then they drain them into the city's sewers.
[02:52:09.938 --> 02:52:12.999]  So instead of being, you know, traditionally cremated or buried,
[02:52:14.113 --> 02:52:22.316]  You are turned into a liquid goo, and then you're drained down the sewers, which goes, by the way, to a bio-sludge collection facility.
[02:52:23.373 --> 02:52:33.484]  And this bio sludge is then they drain the water off of it and they distribute it to rural farms and they spread it on crops.
[02:52:34.084 --> 02:52:42.533]  So hey, your genetically modified corn that you're eating today could be growing in grandma's bio cremated goo that was spread on the crops.
[02:52:42.633 --> 02:52:43.554]  That is happening.
[02:52:44.535 --> 02:52:44.835]  Right now.
[02:52:44.875 --> 02:52:45.836]  That technology exists.
[02:52:45.856 --> 02:52:47.456]  It's called bio-cremation.
[02:52:47.656 --> 02:52:54.199]  Now that company had its license suspended because of violations by the city.
[02:52:54.219 --> 02:52:56.360]  But this technology does exist.
[02:52:57.060 --> 02:53:01.482]  And this is being argued for as a quote recycling technology.
[02:53:01.522 --> 02:53:02.722]  So now you're recycling the dead.
[02:53:03.042 --> 02:53:04.543]  But that's not where this story ends.
[02:53:05.851 --> 02:53:15.115]  This is also happening from LifeNews.com, a story here, abortion clinics are grinding up remains of aborted babies and flushing them down the sewer.
[02:53:16.615 --> 02:53:20.717]  Abortion clinics, I mean, did you ever really wonder where the abortion biomass goes?
[02:53:21.738 --> 02:53:26.799]  I mean, what are they doing with all the dead fetal remains that they're... I don't want to get too graphic here.
[02:53:27.659 --> 02:53:31.400]  They're extracting this from, of course, women who want to have these abortions.
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:34.441]  And of course, they target predominantly African-American neighborhoods.
[02:53:34.501 --> 02:53:37.982]  It's all about depopulating black communities all across America.
[02:53:38.482 --> 02:53:40.202]  This is part of the death cult of the left.
[02:53:40.562 --> 02:53:45.123]  And then that gets flushed down the drain, goes into a garbage disposal.
[02:53:45.864 --> 02:53:47.644]  Just like kind of the one in your kitchen.
[02:53:49.130 --> 02:53:53.593]  And then it drains into the city sewer system, where it once again becomes bio-sludge.
[02:53:54.253 --> 02:53:56.635]  That is then trucked out of the bio-sludge facility.
[02:53:56.675 --> 02:54:01.018]  This happens in every major city in North America, including Canada and the United States.
[02:54:01.918 --> 02:54:05.101]  I've got a film coming up on it, it's called BioSludged.com.
[02:54:05.661 --> 02:54:07.622]  That's where you can view the trailer, you can watch the film.
[02:54:08.063 --> 02:54:09.463]  We're incorporating this story into the film.
[02:54:09.483 --> 02:54:15.688]  It's unbelievable, and it's spread on crops like fruit orchards in the Pacific Northwest, like corn crops.
[02:54:16.548 --> 02:54:25.452]  Are grown in this bio-sludge that is now, we know, made of ground-up, disposed remains of aborted babies.
[02:54:27.092 --> 02:54:36.356]  Think about the demonic evil of this system that is censoring voices of reason and voices of liberty.
[02:54:36.416 --> 02:54:38.977]  They're censoring me, they're censoring Alex Jones, all these other people.
[02:54:40.938 --> 02:54:44.600]  They parade these children around after the Parkland shooting
[02:54:45.666 --> 02:54:59.115]  But they don't tell you that they're supporting the abortion, quote, recycling of dead babies into the bio-sludge, into the food supply, and they're feeding back to you and your children in school lunch programs.
[02:54:59.155 --> 02:55:00.376]  They're feeding back to you.
[02:55:01.488 --> 02:55:06.292]  Your own dead baby fertilizer, if you can call it that.
[02:55:06.833 --> 02:55:21.986]  The reason I decided to mention this story is because it showcases the sickness, the mental insanity, the deep, dark, just seething evil that infects these people, which is why they have to lie constantly about everybody who's a patriot.
[02:55:22.546 --> 02:55:27.108]  They have to attack, they have to smear, they have to claim that they love children.
[02:55:27.168 --> 02:55:30.709]  They love the Parkland school children, and the NRA, they say, hates the children.
[02:55:30.969 --> 02:55:31.449]  Well, guess what?
[02:55:31.669 --> 02:55:35.410]  The NRA isn't grinding up your babies and putting them into the sewer system.
[02:55:35.851 --> 02:55:40.452]  The NRA isn't spreading your dead babies on your crops to feed them back to you.
[02:55:41.613 --> 02:55:41.933]  Okay?
[02:55:42.133 --> 02:55:46.034]  The NRA is just trying to say, they're the oldest civil rights group in America.
[02:55:46.874 --> 02:55:48.255]  I'm losing it over here.
[02:55:48.495 --> 02:55:51.356]  They're trying to say that we have the right to defend ourselves.
[02:55:53.596 --> 02:56:09.104]  To defend ourselves against the deranged, violent, lunatic left that has now decided not only are they going to chew up and grind up your dead babies and feed them back to you through this so-called green recycling, I mean, give me a break, but they're going to silence the people who speak out against this.
[02:56:10.825 --> 02:56:15.268]  I'm already being targeted for daring to pre-announce that film, the bio-sludge film.
[02:56:16.810 --> 02:56:19.812]  I've been leaked information that says I'm going to be targeted because of that film.
[02:56:20.032 --> 02:56:21.933]  When that film comes out, guess what?
[02:56:22.113 --> 02:56:25.835]  Hit pieces against the Health Ranger in the New York Times and the Washington Post and everywhere else.
[02:56:26.175 --> 02:56:26.596]  It's coming.
[02:56:27.016 --> 02:56:27.736]  You can count on it.
[02:56:28.377 --> 02:56:29.357]  But is it going to silence me?
[02:56:29.697 --> 02:56:30.077]  No way.
[02:56:30.618 --> 02:56:31.098]  And you know why?
[02:56:32.199 --> 02:56:34.520]  Because I am an info warrior.
[02:56:35.140 --> 02:56:36.141]  And that's why I'm here today.
[02:56:36.561 --> 02:56:38.282]  And that's why I appreciate your support.
[02:56:39.235 --> 02:56:46.477]  And I ask you to support this organization, InfoWars.com, and the InfoWars store, which you can find of course at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:56:47.058 --> 02:56:56.561]  As long as you keep the cash flow running into this engine, we will keep fighting for your right to speak, your right to think, your right to even exist.
[02:56:57.381 --> 02:57:02.925]  Which is now under threat in this outrageous attack on free speech.
[02:57:03.185 --> 02:57:04.706]  Your First Amendment is under attack.
[02:57:04.726 --> 02:57:06.147]  Your Second Amendment is under attack.
[02:57:06.167 --> 02:57:13.512]  Your Constitution, your Bill of Rights, your very existence is under attack by these deranged lunatic leftists who are pushing us into a civil war.
[02:57:13.993 --> 02:57:15.354]  But we will be here with your support.
[02:57:15.414 --> 02:57:19.717]  We will be here to continue fighting for your right to exist, your right to speak.
[02:57:20.377 --> 02:57:23.880]  We will be that defense system for this Republic.
[02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:26.181]  And we do this voluntarily.
[02:57:26.221 --> 02:57:27.322]  We do it knowingly.
[02:57:27.682 --> 02:57:29.103]  We know we're going to be attacked.
[02:57:29.484 --> 02:57:31.425]  We know that everything is on the line.
[02:57:31.745 --> 02:57:36.869]  We know that this is probably the most important act that we will ever engage in in our lifetimes.
[02:57:37.229 --> 02:57:38.330]  We need your support.
[02:57:38.650 --> 02:57:39.891]  Help us fight the NFL war.
[02:57:40.111 --> 02:57:42.293]  This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today.
[02:57:42.753 --> 02:57:43.614]  Hope to be back soon.
[02:57:44.054 --> 02:57:44.855]  I'll talk to you then.
[02:57:45.315 --> 02:57:46.156]  Stay strong everyone.

[02:58:57.352 --> 02:59:00.434]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:59:00.474 --> 02:59:00.995]  You're on the air.
[02:59:01.015 --> 02:59:02.156]  Thanks for holding.
[02:59:02.256 --> 02:59:03.056]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:59:03.237 --> 02:59:03.857]  Hey, brother.
[02:59:04.137 --> 02:59:04.517]  Good, man.
[02:59:04.537 --> 02:59:05.338]  Thank you for calling.
[02:59:05.418 --> 02:59:05.959]  Hey, hey.
[02:59:06.079 --> 02:59:10.482]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:59:10.702 --> 02:59:17.087]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:59:17.207 --> 02:59:18.908]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:59:18.988 --> 02:59:25.774]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:59:26.414 --> 02:59:27.414]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:59:27.474 --> 02:59:29.915]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:59:29.975 --> 02:59:31.475]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:59:31.876 --> 02:59:33.476]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:59:33.936 --> 02:59:34.676]  And exactly.
[02:59:34.696 --> 02:59:38.937]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:59:39.278 --> 02:59:39.558]  Boom!
[02:59:39.698 --> 02:59:42.518]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:59:42.578 --> 02:59:43.119]  It's amazing.
[02:59:43.179 --> 02:59:44.459]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:59:44.539 --> 02:59:47.400]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:59:57.025 --> 02:59:57.946]  You got a business.
[02:59:57.986 --> 02:59:59.687]  You didn't build that.
[02:59:59.707 --> 03:00:01.408]  Somebody else made that happen.
[03:00:24.562 --> 03:00:28.727]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:29.468 --> 03:00:30.749]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:35.354 --> 03:00:38.057]  And we now enter the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:38.097 --> 03:00:41.040]  It's been a real privilege to be able to be with you today.
[03:00:41.701 --> 03:00:42.562]  My name is Mike Adams.
[03:00:42.602 --> 03:00:44.744]  I'm filling in for Alex today as part of the
[03:00:45.914 --> 03:00:49.415]  Well, I guess we are now the actual resistance against tyranny.
[03:00:50.095 --> 03:00:55.756]  And this hour is hosted by Paul Joseph Watson, who I'm going to welcome here in just a second.
[03:00:55.856 --> 03:01:01.238]  I just got to say, though, Paul Joseph Watson, he's one of the many people I deeply admire.
[03:01:01.258 --> 03:01:02.778]  I watch all his videos.
[03:01:02.938 --> 03:01:03.518]  I share them.
[03:01:03.618 --> 03:01:07.139]  We talk about Paul as the superstar that he is on YouTube.
[03:01:07.199 --> 03:01:10.120]  And you're not going to believe this, listeners, but to this day,
[03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:16.745]  Until this moment, I have never spoken with Paul Joseph Watson, so this is a real privilege for me to be able to do so.
[03:01:16.805 --> 03:01:18.887]  Paul, it's awesome to be able to speak to you.
[03:01:18.907 --> 03:01:19.647]  How are you doing today, man?
[03:01:20.768 --> 03:01:21.228]  Good, Mike.
[03:01:21.268 --> 03:01:21.709]  How are you?
[03:01:22.249 --> 03:01:25.892]  Well, we are staying busy here in Austin, Texas, trying to fight for our liberty.
[03:01:27.093 --> 03:01:27.934]  That's all we can do.
[03:01:29.207 --> 03:01:31.448]  I mean, we've been kind of successful.
[03:01:31.508 --> 03:01:53.102]  We've won the battle, I guess, against CNN for the moment, you know, with the YouTube channel becoming active again, Mike, which is what I was talking about in an article on Infowars.com today, which is, I went into my demographics, you know, the analytics on the back end of YouTube, and basically confirmed what I already suspected, because I'd never actually analysed this before.
[03:01:53.843 --> 03:01:55.704]  Which is in comparison to CNN.
[03:01:56.124 --> 03:02:00.686]  You know, their average audience, their average primetime audience is aged 60.
[03:02:01.506 --> 03:02:03.327]  Now, I don't have anything against the elderly.
[03:02:03.607 --> 03:02:07.829]  Not that 60 is that elderly these days, but you know, I don't have anything against older generations.
[03:02:08.329 --> 03:02:10.190]  But this goes to why they're panicking.
[03:02:10.670 --> 03:02:13.811]  Because you then compare that to my demographic on YouTube.
[03:02:14.580 --> 03:02:21.622]  The biggest sections, by far, are 18 to 24 year olds and 25 to 34 year olds.
[03:02:21.682 --> 03:02:30.025]  Now obviously that's, you know, related to the fact that it is YouTube and young people are on that platform, but that is my primary platform.
[03:02:30.045 --> 03:02:32.185]  That is my, you know, cable media.
[03:02:32.205 --> 03:02:33.005]  That's the equivalent.
[03:02:33.205 --> 03:02:34.606]  So you're dangerous.
[03:02:35.126 --> 03:02:39.913]  You're obviously dangerous because you're influencing young minds who represent the future voters.
[03:02:40.333 --> 03:02:47.103]  What is it about your style or your message that CNN thinks is so darn dangerous that you have to be destroyed?
[03:02:48.829 --> 03:02:58.535]  I think, Mike, it's because I've kind of absorbed tactics and techniques that other YouTubers, successful YouTubers, have used, not even in the political realm.
[03:02:58.996 --> 03:03:07.361]  So things just related to do with the editing of the videos, even the sound effects used in the videos, you know, the style of the script.
[03:03:07.761 --> 03:03:13.485]  I learned everything from successful YouTubers, most of whom weren't even political, applied that politically.
[03:03:14.125 --> 03:03:18.149]  And by doing that, got an audience on board that maybe wasn't political before.
[03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:21.733]  So it's reaching new people, it's reaching young people.
[03:03:22.253 --> 03:03:31.022]  And that's, you know, I write in this article, all the messages I get, well most of them anyway, they're from like teenagers, they're from people in their young 20s, they're at school.
[03:03:31.502 --> 03:03:36.908]  They say to me that being a conservative or libertarian is a form of rebellion.
[03:03:37.428 --> 03:03:40.211]  Because it goes against everything what they're being taught.
[03:03:40.591 --> 03:03:43.573]  All the dominant institutions, culturally, are left-leaning.
[03:03:43.674 --> 03:03:45.735]  Silicon Valley, the media, it's all left-leaning.
[03:03:45.975 --> 03:03:49.318]  You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture.
[03:03:49.719 --> 03:03:51.120]  So we're the new counterculture.
[03:03:51.140 --> 03:03:59.367]  I've been saying it for over a year, and that's what young people in Generation Z, which is the most conservative culture since World War II, are telling me as well.
[03:03:59.892 --> 03:04:09.237]  But every time CNN or these other left-wing legacy media organizations, every time they try to launch a young, targeting, youth-oriented program, it fails.
[03:04:09.377 --> 03:04:09.957]  It flops.
[03:04:10.018 --> 03:04:14.340]  They bail, and it's over, and they've just blown $25 million.
[03:04:14.640 --> 03:04:17.942]  Yet you do this essentially on a shoestring budget, and you're far more successful.
[03:04:19.093 --> 03:04:31.583]  Yeah, I do all the editing myself, and I think that's... People can tell when something's not authentic, when the individual who created it hasn't injected their personality into it, which is all that I do, for better or worse.
[03:04:32.063 --> 03:04:32.804]  They don't do that.
[03:04:32.944 --> 03:04:38.629]  You know, you need hard work, you need to learn from other YouTubers, as I just explained, to be successful on YouTube.
[03:04:38.669 --> 03:04:41.791]  CNN, they just throw money at it and think they can be successful that way.
[03:04:41.851 --> 03:04:42.872]  We're going out to break, Paul.
[03:04:42.932 --> 03:04:43.793]  That's why they're panicking.
[03:04:44.173 --> 03:04:45.435]  We're just going out to break right now.
[03:04:45.835 --> 03:04:48.018]  Paul Joseph Watson here hosting the 4th Hour.
[03:04:48.579 --> 03:04:50.241]  Mike Adams just asking a couple of questions.
[03:04:50.281 --> 03:04:50.961]  This is awesome.
[03:04:50.982 --> 03:04:51.903]  I'm having a great time.
[03:04:51.923 --> 03:04:55.587]  We'll be right back after this break and listening to the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour.
[03:04:55.907 --> 03:04:56.388]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.511 --> 03:05:05.252]  I'm so excited.
[03:05:05.312 --> 03:05:14.878]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:05:15.458 --> 03:05:20.642]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:05:20.962 --> 03:05:23.764]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[03:05:23.984 --> 03:05:32.730]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:05:34.851 --> 03:05:39.634]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:05:40.155 --> 03:05:42.936]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:05:43.057 --> 03:05:53.944]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:05:54.444 --> 03:05:55.745]  It is amazing!
[03:05:57.126 --> 03:06:02.109]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase of the operation.
[03:06:17.029 --> 03:06:21.131]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:06:21.911 --> 03:06:23.452]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:24.052 --> 03:06:26.053]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[03:06:26.373 --> 03:06:30.835]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[03:06:36.426 --> 03:06:40.169]  You are listening to The Fourth Hour here, March 6th, 2018.
[03:06:40.369 --> 03:06:41.970]  This is The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:42.571 --> 03:06:44.452]  Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in today.
[03:06:44.492 --> 03:06:45.773]  This is my last segment.
[03:06:45.993 --> 03:06:53.339]  I am thrilled to be able to ask a couple of questions to your official host for this hour, Paul Joseph Watson, who is being targeted by CNN.
[03:06:54.179 --> 03:06:58.085]  And Paul, I really appreciate you allowing me to ask you a couple of questions here today.
[03:06:58.426 --> 03:07:00.269]  A burning question that I have for you.
[03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:08.762]  Isn't this censorship purge and admission by these left-wing techno-tyrants that they have lost the argument?
[03:07:10.959 --> 03:07:13.700]  Yeah, they've lost the argument on YouTube to a great extent.
[03:07:14.020 --> 03:07:26.944]  Basically, all they've got on YouTube is these left-wing late-night comedy channels, which, I mean, let's admit they are still very successful on YouTube, but, you know, that takes a gargantuan effort to produce that kind of material.
[03:07:26.984 --> 03:07:32.305]  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel, Colbert, whoever, they've all got, like, teams of five to ten writers who write everything for them.
[03:07:32.666 --> 03:07:34.046]  Massive production costs.
[03:07:34.406 --> 03:07:39.348]  So it takes them way more energy and resources to get out the same kind of content that we do.
[03:07:39.848 --> 03:07:40.488]  Difference is,
[03:07:41.168 --> 03:08:01.263]  On YouTube, there's a community, which isn't even right-wing, it's not really that conservative, it's mainly based around a sceptics community, or an anti-SJW community, which is strong, and it resonates with young people, because all these people have very interesting personalities, great delivery, great skills with editing and so forth, great content.
[03:08:01.623 --> 03:08:03.204]  There's nothing like it on the left.
[03:08:03.265 --> 03:08:04.726]  There's what, like the Young Turks?
[03:08:04.786 --> 03:08:07.247]  I mean, that's in decline, nobody really cares about that anymore.
[03:08:07.568 --> 03:08:09.089]  They don't have anything similar.
[03:08:09.509 --> 03:08:25.257]  And I noticed, Mike, that a lot of this YouTube censorship kind of stepped up a gear after I gave a comment to the New York Times about six months ago where I joked, kind of tongue-in-cheek because it's kind of true, but I joked that YouTube was a right-wing safe space.
[03:08:25.277 --> 03:08:26.117]  I remember that.
[03:08:27.023 --> 03:08:36.472]  And ever since that, ever since that time, the Wall Street Journal, CNN, you know, actively lobbying in direct communication with YouTube saying, oh, what about this video?
[03:08:36.492 --> 03:08:37.313]  What about this video?
[03:08:37.333 --> 03:08:38.674]  Doesn't this violate your guidelines?
[03:08:39.134 --> 03:08:40.536]  Ever since then, they've stepped up.
[03:08:40.916 --> 03:08:41.657]  The CEO
[03:08:42.694 --> 03:08:48.978]  The Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago came out and said, this is interrupting our revenue stream, basically to paraphrase him.
[03:08:48.998 --> 03:08:52.539]  He said, this is stopping us making money and taking over the narrative.
[03:08:53.040 --> 03:08:57.102]  We need to make the online digital environment less cluttered.
[03:08:57.522 --> 03:08:58.963]  Obviously he was talking about censorship.
[03:08:59.103 --> 03:08:59.483]  But isn't it?
[03:08:59.503 --> 03:09:00.504]  So it's really picked up.
[03:09:00.884 --> 03:09:01.845]  But it's astonishing to me that...
[03:09:02.845 --> 03:09:12.772]  When they're issuing strikes against you, or Alex Jones, or me, or others, they're claiming that we are, quote, bullying people, although they never really point out where and how we bullied anybody.
[03:09:13.072 --> 03:09:18.616]  And yet, CNN, just all out bullying you, and bullying Alex Jones.
[03:09:18.716 --> 03:09:22.659]  I mean, the bullying from the left, I mean, censorship is a form of bullying.
[03:09:23.119 --> 03:09:28.203]  The bullies are claiming that you're bullying somebody else that they can't even really name.
[03:09:28.283 --> 03:09:31.185]  I mean, the hypocrisy here is at a whole new level.
[03:09:32.597 --> 03:09:47.449]  Well exactly and let's not forget that just I think it was last week or the week before as you see up on screen now, CNN sent a reporter to an old lady's home in Florida because she had posted some memes on Facebook that some Russians had also posted.
[03:09:47.769 --> 03:09:48.029]  This was
[03:09:48.049 --> 03:09:55.056]  This is a lady who was having, you know, having active political meetings for Trump supporters where actual physical people turned up, not Russian bots.
[03:09:55.456 --> 03:10:00.801]  They go to her house, stick a camera in her face, dox her, bully her, harass her.
[03:10:01.222 --> 03:10:03.484]  Mike, that video's up on CNN's YouTube channel.
[03:10:03.844 --> 03:10:06.067]  Not flagged for bullying or harassment.
[03:10:06.367 --> 03:10:07.748]  They get nothing whatsoever.
[03:10:08.129 --> 03:10:10.511]  You know, you had the Daily Beast last week.
[03:10:11.287 --> 03:10:17.252]  Expose the daughters of Pamela Geller, who aren't even involved in politics.
[03:10:17.752 --> 03:10:21.515]  They're on Instagram, they have deals with production companies to make content.
[03:10:21.575 --> 03:10:22.996]  Again, nothing political about it.
[03:10:23.337 --> 03:10:32.704]  They exposed them simply because of the views of their mother, who by the way is under death threat from Islamic terrorists on a regular basis, threatening to behead her.
[03:10:33.124 --> 03:10:37.787]  So the mainstream media can expose, dox, bully, harass people all day long.
[03:10:37.827 --> 03:10:43.651]  Remember CNN threatened to reveal the Trump wrestling meme maker unless he expressed proper remorse.
[03:10:43.811 --> 03:10:44.031]  Right.
[03:10:44.091 --> 03:10:49.154]  So they can do it all day long and then point the finger at us if we talk about political hot button issues.
[03:10:49.414 --> 03:10:50.375]  Total hypocrisy.
[03:10:50.595 --> 03:10:58.337]  But it seems like, I mean, you're absolutely right with what you just said, but it seems like underneath all of this there is a desperation of the left-wing media.
[03:10:58.377 --> 03:10:59.477]  There's a desperation.
[03:10:59.898 --> 03:11:08.380]  They believe, I mean, on the surface they say that people like you make no sense and that what you're saying isn't true and no one has any reason to listen to you, but underneath
[03:11:08.780 --> 03:11:09.381]  They're panicked.
[03:11:09.401 --> 03:11:14.765]  They're saying, oh my god, Paul Joseph Watson, he's attracting people who are young and brilliant and liberty-minded.
[03:11:14.825 --> 03:11:15.946]  He's waking people up.
[03:11:15.986 --> 03:11:16.707]  He's influential.
[03:11:16.747 --> 03:11:18.669]  He's convincing people and we have to silence him.
[03:11:18.929 --> 03:11:20.430]  That's the real message from all of this.
[03:11:20.450 --> 03:11:24.054]  The fact that they're targeting you is proof of your success.
[03:11:25.404 --> 03:11:30.065]  Well, I mean, I often say, I'm just here in a corner of YouTube making content.
[03:11:30.145 --> 03:11:31.546]  Why are you so obsessed with me?
[03:11:31.926 --> 03:11:35.006]  But I mean, that's why it is, because I'm a threat to their monopoly.
[03:11:35.046 --> 03:11:37.807]  They can't compete with us on certain networks.
[03:11:37.847 --> 03:11:45.609]  Let's not forget that CNN's a global news organization with staff, you know, what, 100 times that of InfoWars, probably more.
[03:11:46.109 --> 03:11:47.629]  Massive corporate backing.
[03:11:48.110 --> 03:11:49.610]  And still, you go on YouTube,
[03:11:50.439 --> 03:12:00.262]  Alex Jones Channel, and if it's not deleted, it's still up there at this point, if you take the Alex Jones Channel and my channel, just those two together, we have more subscribers than CNN.
[03:12:00.482 --> 03:12:00.722]  Right.
[03:12:00.902 --> 03:12:07.084]  So they can't, they're competing with us, but for the fact that they're a massive global news network, we threaten them.
[03:12:07.444 --> 03:12:08.885]  You know, Mike, we had the
[03:12:09.825 --> 03:12:18.687]  Stats released from Nielsen a few days ago where CNN's lost 19% of its total day audience, 16% of its primetime audience in the past year.
[03:12:19.007 --> 03:12:21.808]  They haven't got their news show in the top 20.
[03:12:22.188 --> 03:12:26.509]  I mean if the stock market plummeted 20% in a year, that would be called almost a crash.
[03:12:26.549 --> 03:12:30.670]  I mean CNN's viewer participation is essentially crashing.
[03:12:30.710 --> 03:12:31.870]  It's extraordinary.
[03:12:33.243 --> 03:12:40.268]  Yeah, and obviously they got a bit of a bump from the Trump derangement syndrome in 2017, but they're coming back down to earth with a bang.
[03:12:40.709 --> 03:12:44.632]  They get 797,000 total viewers average.
[03:12:45.052 --> 03:12:52.738]  Now that's half of what MSNBC gets, and you've got to remember, you know, CNN's on in hotel rooms, it's on in airports, it's on in bars all the time.
[03:12:53.058 --> 03:12:56.480]  They've got more reach, and yet they still get half the viewers of MSNBC.
[03:12:56.961 --> 03:12:59.823]  Fox, you know, they get nearly 3 million viewers, way ahead of them.
[03:13:00.303 --> 03:13:01.105]  They're pathetic.
[03:13:01.225 --> 03:13:08.195]  I mean, now they're attacking us to get attention for them because, you know, they like this jealous ex-girlfriend stalker behavior that I've mentioned.
[03:13:08.215 --> 03:13:12.422]  They seem to be applying that to InfoWars, having applied it to Trump for the past
[03:13:13.146 --> 03:13:13.766]  Yeah, plus.
[03:13:14.066 --> 03:13:14.926]  Alright, Predictions.
[03:13:15.387 --> 03:13:17.307]  Paul Joseph Watson, PJW.
[03:13:17.747 --> 03:13:19.428]  Predictions, where do you think this is going?
[03:13:19.448 --> 03:13:25.689]  Are these totalitarian tech companies going to suffer such a backlash that they back off?
[03:13:26.089 --> 03:13:39.433]  Or are they so desperate to cover up whatever may be coming, maybe the midterm elections, that they're going to continue to be aggressive in destroying the free speech rights of individuals, even knowing that they, the tech giants, are discrediting themselves in the process?
[03:13:39.593 --> 03:13:40.093]  What's your take?
[03:13:41.417 --> 03:13:46.881]  Well they've got a bunch of lawsuits up against them right now so it depends how they go, you know, setting the precedent.
[03:13:47.081 --> 03:13:54.305]  I think if they were smart about it, not to give them ideas, they would go with the algorithmic censorship route because that's what Facebook did.
[03:13:54.626 --> 03:14:07.334]  I've noticed I'm getting, you know, suspended a lot less on Facebook now than I was a year ago but as we saw with Trump, you know, he's lost like 50% of his traffic through Facebook because they buried him in the algorithm.
[03:14:07.754 --> 03:14:10.655]  So I think that's what we'll see on YouTube.
[03:14:10.755 --> 03:14:15.176]  Like 85% of my views on YouTube come from the subscribers and the recommended videos.
[03:14:15.196 --> 03:14:17.457]  They don't even come from external traffic sources.
[03:14:17.897 --> 03:14:18.597]  So they're going to do that.
[03:14:18.617 --> 03:14:20.138]  They're going to bury us in the algorithm.
[03:14:20.518 --> 03:14:22.038]  We won't even be able to prove it.
[03:14:22.518 --> 03:14:28.140]  And then there won't be any case against them that you can point to and say, this is the fact that you're deliberately doing this.
[03:14:28.180 --> 03:14:34.902]  So it's going to be an algorithmic censorship across the board, whether that be YouTube, Google search results, Facebook or Twitter.
[03:14:35.302 --> 03:14:40.623]  Right, they can hide it in the algorithm, which is a black box that, you know, we don't know what's happening.
[03:14:41.083 --> 03:14:47.944]  Shadow banning, maybe is one way to say it, or just delisting you in the search algorithms or display algorithms.
[03:14:48.004 --> 03:14:55.426]  Now, of course, if you're a leftist screaming to murder Donald Trump or kill the police, then you're going to be boosted up in the algorithm.
[03:14:55.446 --> 03:14:58.066]  You're going to get top billing for all that hatred.
[03:14:58.766 --> 03:15:03.407]  But if you stand for liberty and protecting life and all these other things, you're going to be penalized.
[03:15:04.127 --> 03:15:06.049]  That's insane, but that's their algorithm.
[03:15:07.391 --> 03:15:12.277]  Yeah, the other issue with that is obviously we had mass demonetization last year.
[03:15:12.657 --> 03:15:16.802]  My last 20 odd videos have now been, they're automatically demonetized when you upload them.
[03:15:16.842 --> 03:15:17.342]  I don't care.
[03:15:17.362 --> 03:15:19.425]  I don't make any money out of that anyway, but
[03:15:20.228 --> 03:15:27.292]  People have pointed to the fact that probably what's happening is the demonetized videos get less upvoted in the algorithm.
[03:15:27.332 --> 03:15:33.716]  So if they can apply this level of demonetization for political commentary, they can ensure that it's buried in the algorithm.
[03:15:33.756 --> 03:15:36.557]  So that's another tactic that YouTube appears to have adopted.
[03:15:36.597 --> 03:15:37.198]  Wow, good.
[03:15:37.698 --> 03:15:38.198]  Good points.
[03:15:38.698 --> 03:15:40.379]  Paul, it's great to talk with you today.
[03:15:40.660 --> 03:15:42.621]  Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions.
[03:15:42.661 --> 03:15:43.301]  This is your show.
[03:15:43.321 --> 03:15:45.542]  For the rest of the show, this is The Fourth Hour.
[03:15:45.582 --> 03:15:47.063]  And thank you, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:15:47.083 --> 03:15:47.884]  Great to talk with you today.
[03:16:02.899 --> 03:16:13.265]  Infowars, my radio program, our TV broadcast, our films, are among some of the biggest viral sensations in the last 20 years.
[03:16:13.966 --> 03:16:17.568]  And we're bringing back nationalism, we're bringing back sovereignty, we're bringing back
[03:16:18.248 --> 03:16:22.550]  True populism and rule for, of, and by the people.
[03:16:22.630 --> 03:16:36.796]  And that's why Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other mainstream media outlets, the modern robber barons of our age, admit, even in congressional hearings and in undercover videos, that the number one enemy to shut down is Infowars.
[03:16:37.296 --> 03:16:52.225]  As of just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started, on Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag, NYC terrorist attack, which is, quote, trending, marked with a red button saying, quote, live,
[03:16:53.246 --> 03:17:02.752]  The top tweet links to an InfoWars story with the headline, Imam, I warned de Blasio about New York City of terror he was too busy bashing Trump.
[03:17:03.372 --> 03:17:10.697]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[03:17:11.617 --> 03:17:19.062]  How quickly can you act and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[03:17:19.782 --> 03:17:23.387]  That's something we're thinking about all the time because it's a bad user experience.
[03:17:23.688 --> 03:17:24.789]  The system self-corrected.
[03:17:24.909 --> 03:17:27.753]  That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[03:17:27.773 --> 03:17:29.996]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[03:17:31.197 --> 03:17:31.978]  But you saw this?
[03:17:32.219 --> 03:17:32.940]  USA Today.
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:34.462]  At lunch I did, yeah.
[03:17:34.622 --> 03:17:36.204]  And I also saw the system correct it.
[03:17:37.365 --> 03:17:46.116]  At the very least, we can say that, like, this shelf of videos from news partners is legitimate news because we know that these are legitimate news organizations.
[03:17:46.957 --> 03:17:51.982]  And if at that point somebody decides they're going to scroll past that and go find Alex Jones, well...
[03:17:52.723 --> 03:17:54.504]  They were looking for him and he wasn't speaking with anyone.
[03:17:54.945 --> 03:18:00.888]  So they shadow ban our videos, they block our articles, they ban us from advertising on Google platforms.
[03:18:01.369 --> 03:18:05.711]  That's why it's so essential that you continue to stand in the face of their censorship.
[03:18:05.931 --> 03:18:08.573]  Because if they can shut us down, they can shut you down.
[03:18:09.133 --> 03:18:12.936]  But because of their brazenness, it's caused this Tryzan effect.
[03:18:13.776 --> 03:18:21.418]  And they're now panicking because their attempts to censor us have only made the message expand and get out in ways it never would have.
[03:18:22.078 --> 03:18:23.798]  So I know a lot of you are smarter than I am.
[03:18:23.858 --> 03:18:25.739]  You've got great inventive ways to take action.
[03:18:26.239 --> 03:18:35.601]  But however you do it, spreading articles, spreading videos, on your own email list, telling friends and family about the censored information in person, however you do it, calling in to C-SPAN.
[03:18:37.125 --> 03:18:43.673]  Getting on other shows online, letting them know that InfoWars is the tip of the spear, and that we can be censored successfully.
[03:18:44.844 --> 03:18:46.365]  All of you can be censored as well.
[03:18:46.845 --> 03:18:50.468]  So be sure and like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter.
[03:18:50.768 --> 03:18:52.689]  Be sure to send out the videos, the articles.
[03:18:53.710 --> 03:18:56.732]  Be sure to report on anything we've covered that you think is important.

[03:19:09.881 --> 03:19:10.041]  I think?
[03:19:30.074 --> 03:19:32.134]  It's evil, and together we're gonna defeat it.
[03:19:32.515 --> 03:19:45.017]  So folks, you have absolutely been the resistance, you have cut through all their propaganda, and because of that I salute you, and I ask you now, more than ever, to redouble your efforts, because if you're watching this transmission and listening, you are the resistance.
[03:19:56.380 --> 03:19:58.260]  Bing bing bong bong bing bing bing.
[03:20:06.189 --> 03:20:19.577]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.797 --> 03:20:22.318]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:20:22.478 --> 03:20:24.199]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.479 --> 03:20:28.442]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:31.593 --> 03:20:34.578]  Real live it is, fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:35.099 --> 03:20:39.085]  No guests today, but a lot of news to cover, so I'm going to jump right into it.
[03:20:39.486 --> 03:20:45.415]  Talked about this before the break with Mike Adams, so I'll run through it quicker than I would have done because we've covered some of it, but...
[03:20:46.167 --> 03:20:52.672]  We have the video where CNN attacked me and I responded in kind, but this headline is up on InfoWars.com right now.
[03:20:53.173 --> 03:20:56.255]  This is why CNN hates InfoWars.
[03:20:56.536 --> 03:20:58.177]  Why are they so obsessed with us?
[03:20:58.277 --> 03:21:06.264]  Why are they behaving like the crazy ex-girlfriend stalker as they did when they stalked Trump on the golf course by hiding behind the bushes?
[03:21:06.324 --> 03:21:08.966]  They appear to have applied those methods to InfoWars now.
[03:21:10.166 --> 03:21:28.816]  One of the primary reasons why CNN is attempting to sabotage InfoWars, by having YouTube shut down our channels, by targeting our advertisers, even though we don't make any money off that anyway, they're too stupid to realise that, is because we're attracting an increasingly younger audience, while CNN's audience is literally dying.
[03:21:29.955 --> 03:21:31.596]  These stats are from Nielsen Live.
[03:21:31.636 --> 03:21:34.997]  This is last year, so their audience has probably gotten even older by now.
[03:21:35.537 --> 03:21:39.598]  The average CNN viewer is 60 years old, 6-0.
[03:21:40.118 --> 03:21:44.740]  Last year, or 2016, it was 59, so it appears to be getting older.
[03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:50.341]  Compare this to the average age of viewers to my YouTube channel.
[03:21:50.501 --> 03:21:52.462]  People say, well, YouTube's very different from
[03:21:53.280 --> 03:21:56.622]  You know, cable news, yes, but YouTube is my platform.
[03:21:57.002 --> 03:21:58.183]  That's their platform.
[03:21:58.643 --> 03:22:11.130]  So you compare it to my platform, and you can see the graph in this article which is in the tweet, by far the biggest demographics are 18 to 24 year olds and 25 to 34 year olds.
[03:22:12.131 --> 03:22:17.894]  The people watching my content are predominantly 18 to 34 years old.
[03:22:18.375 --> 03:22:22.317]  In other words, they're not literally dying, like CNN's audience.
[03:22:23.001 --> 03:22:25.902]  Nothing against the elderly, but this is about demographics.
[03:22:25.962 --> 03:22:29.243]  This is about the future of information.
[03:22:30.964 --> 03:22:34.245]  Now, I said to Mike, every day I receive messages from young people.
[03:22:35.245 --> 03:22:38.367]  Sometimes it's like 12 year olds, for God's sake.
[03:22:38.387 --> 03:22:39.967]  12 year olds are watching this content.
[03:22:39.987 --> 03:22:44.009]  I've got to try and cut out the cussing if my audience is getting younger and younger.
[03:22:44.589 --> 03:22:44.809]  But
[03:22:45.623 --> 03:22:52.265]  All the messages I get are from teens, from people in their early 20s, who say I changed their mind, or similar people on YouTube changed their mind.
[03:22:52.666 --> 03:22:53.366]  They were liberals.
[03:22:53.806 --> 03:23:05.670]  They saw a message that was punchy, that was delivered in a manner suited to attract young people, suited to attract a YouTube audience that's grown up in this digital age, and it's resonating.
[03:23:07.111 --> 03:23:12.633]  My personal interactions with people who recognize me on the street, they're all people in their 20s.
[03:23:14.278 --> 03:23:17.280]  Again, nothing against all people, but that's CNN's audience.
[03:23:18.620 --> 03:23:19.801]  Of course, we've seen the studies.
[03:23:19.901 --> 03:23:29.205]  Generation Z, which is people born after 1995, are also more likely to be more conservative than any generation since World War II.
[03:23:30.286 --> 03:23:40.091]  Now, Forbes reported, quote, Gen Z is more individualistic, more conservative both socially and fiscally, and they're already making waves of impact on our political system.
[03:23:40.711 --> 03:23:42.132]  Those studies have confirmed
[03:23:43.447 --> 03:23:50.734]  As opposed to Millennials, who are all narcissists and they need their safe spaces and their puppies to cuddle if they hear an opinion they don't like.
[03:23:51.434 --> 03:23:56.478]  You know, you challenge their argument on Twitter, they'd lock down their account faster than the speed of light.
[03:23:58.200 --> 03:23:59.221]  Those are the Millennials.
[03:23:59.341 --> 03:24:05.686]  Gen Z is really more positive in terms of not being so precious, not being such snowflakes.
[03:24:05.946 --> 03:24:10.170]  Studies show that they're more conservative, which just basically means they're not following the herd.
[03:24:11.067 --> 03:24:14.690]  Of course, there's a huge gamut of views that you can't just pigeonhole into the word conservative.
[03:24:15.190 --> 03:24:18.092]  But again, this goes back to what I said a year ago, a year plus.
[03:24:18.613 --> 03:24:21.115]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:24:21.795 --> 03:24:26.118]  Of course, the media came out when I said that with a volley of articles asserting that I was wrong.
[03:24:26.779 --> 03:24:27.359]  No, it's not.
[03:24:27.399 --> 03:24:27.920]  No, it's not.
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:28.940]  Yes, it is.
[03:24:29.361 --> 03:24:33.804]  You can't be the dominant cultural... You can't be the dominant culture and the counterculture.
[03:24:33.824 --> 03:24:35.145]  It doesn't work like that.
[03:24:36.207 --> 03:24:39.649]  In the 60s, in the 70s, what did we see?
[03:24:39.689 --> 03:24:48.394]  We saw predominantly the Christian right trying to ban and censor literature, art, music that was, quote, offensive.
[03:24:49.095 --> 03:24:52.797]  Remember the burning of the Beatles albums back in the 60s?
[03:24:52.837 --> 03:24:55.138]  Again, that was right-wing censorship.
[03:24:55.939 --> 03:24:58.720]  The censorship of the Sex Pistols in my country in the 1970s.
[03:25:00.362 --> 03:25:04.086]  Where they banned them from playing concerts because they were offensive.
[03:25:04.426 --> 03:25:07.850]  Again, that came from the Conservative Christian Right.
[03:25:08.290 --> 03:25:10.012]  The roles have flipped, haven't they?
[03:25:11.634 --> 03:25:12.535]  Now what do you see?
[03:25:13.095 --> 03:25:16.959]  Big tech, Silicon Valley censorship, the James Damore case.
[03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:21.464]  The far left has taken on the role as official censors.
[03:25:22.737 --> 03:25:37.290]  Which is why people, young people, and I get these messages too in school, in college, tell me that they're Conservatives or they're Libertarians simply as a backlash to that dominant culture censoring or trying to censor certain information.
[03:25:37.691 --> 03:25:41.935]  If you try to censor certain information, the Streisand effect happens.
[03:25:42.335 --> 03:25:44.257]  It gives that information, whether it's
[03:25:45.293 --> 03:25:47.154]  Fringe or edgy or what, it doesn't matter.
[03:25:47.434 --> 03:25:54.458]  Or if it's just pretty mainstream conservatism or cultural libertarianism, it gives that information an illicit cachet.
[03:25:55.759 --> 03:26:03.163]  Whenever you try to ban anything, whenever you try to tell young people what they can and can't see, what they can and can't listen to, what happens?
[03:26:03.223 --> 03:26:07.966]  It makes them more determined to listen to that content, to read that content.
[03:26:08.832 --> 03:26:13.956]  So the more they try to ban and censor my opinions, my content, the more I resonate with young people.
[03:26:14.316 --> 03:26:17.918]  They'd be better served just to leave me alone, but then again, that's not much fun, is it?
[03:26:17.938 --> 03:26:22.682]  I mean, I get a lot of content from them attacking me, so I kind of rely on it too.
[03:26:23.562 --> 03:26:27.445]  But again, Gen Z, more individualistic, more conservative.
[03:26:28.045 --> 03:26:31.308]  The messages I get, people I meet on the street, young people.
[03:26:31.628 --> 03:26:37.292]  It's a very young audience, way more, way younger than it was even five years ago, from my perspective.
[03:26:38.300 --> 03:26:49.047]  And again, when dominant cultural institutions claim to be the counterculture, or claim that Conservatives can't be the counterculture, because we were the dominant culture in the past, it's just not an argument.
[03:26:50.008 --> 03:26:57.252]  Silicon Valley, the media, cultural institutions, the arts, Hollywood, it's all far left.
[03:26:57.372 --> 03:27:03.596]  If everything's far left, what's left to be the authentic, rebellious counterculture?
[03:27:03.636 --> 03:27:04.237]  It could only be
[03:27:04.995 --> 03:27:14.538]  Not even conservatism or on the right specifically, even just like sceptic-centrism becomes avant-garde, which it is on YouTube, which is why they're trying to shut it down.
[03:27:16.279 --> 03:27:20.520]  Now you add to this CNN's ratings, which I also mentioned earlier.
[03:27:21.340 --> 03:27:24.961]  CNN doesn't have a single news show in the top 20 news shows.
[03:27:25.201 --> 03:27:25.761]  Imagine that.
[03:27:26.182 --> 03:27:29.183]  I think Anderson Cooper is like 24 on the list.
[03:27:29.503 --> 03:27:30.423]  There you see the list.
[03:27:31.932 --> 03:27:33.693]  15 out of the top 20 of Fox News shows.
[03:27:33.713 --> 03:27:36.936]  They can't even crack the top 20 with one show!
[03:27:36.956 --> 03:27:41.661]  Despite being on across airports, hotels, bars, you name it.
[03:27:42.562 --> 03:27:49.609]  They've lost 19% of their total day audience, 16% of their primetime audience over the course of the past year.
[03:27:50.970 --> 03:27:52.792]  So you compare CNN's average audience
[03:27:53.945 --> 03:27:56.767]  Per day, 979,000 total viewers.
[03:27:57.428 --> 03:27:59.149]  Half that of MSNBC.
[03:27:59.189 --> 03:28:02.612]  They can only get half the viewers that MSNBC gets.
[03:28:03.733 --> 03:28:05.334]  You compare them to Fox News.
[03:28:05.854 --> 03:28:09.937]  Fox News gets an average viewing audience of 2.766 million.
[03:28:11.138 --> 03:28:13.760]  So what, that's almost three times that of CNN.
[03:28:14.881 --> 03:28:19.284]  They had a bit of a spurt with the Trump derangement syndrome after the election, after the inauguration.
[03:28:19.625 --> 03:28:23.708]  Now they've returned to their natural state of malaise and decline.
[03:28:24.719 --> 03:28:42.692]  So, you know, as I commented in the article, given all this, maybe CNN should concentrate on improving their dreadful ratings and content instead of trying to sabotage other news networks and have them banned by YouTube, as they've been caught doing with InfoWars.com.
[03:28:44.187 --> 03:28:46.250]  We'll come back on the other side and wrap up.
[03:28:46.270 --> 03:28:51.157]  We're going to just talk a little bit more about CNN and then get on to the Italian election.
[03:28:51.277 --> 03:28:54.161]  Massive victory for the populist parties in Italy.
[03:28:54.201 --> 03:28:55.723]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:28:56.103 --> 03:28:57.345]  Infowars.com.
[03:28:57.365 --> 03:28:57.826]  We'll be back.
[03:29:02.136 --> 03:29:02.496]  Hunters!
[03:29:03.076 --> 03:29:04.457]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:29:04.737 --> 03:29:06.018]  You can't survive without it.
[03:29:06.218 --> 03:29:07.118]  But where do you get it?
[03:29:07.418 --> 03:29:13.181]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[03:29:13.401 --> 03:29:19.124]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[03:29:19.304 --> 03:29:36.188]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[03:29:36.568 --> 03:29:38.690]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:29:39.050 --> 03:29:40.251]  Stainless steel construction.
[03:29:40.532 --> 03:29:41.232]  Easy assembly.
[03:29:41.573 --> 03:29:42.193]  Low maintenance.
[03:29:42.473 --> 03:29:44.295]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[03:30:02.551 --> 03:30:06.975]  The hysteria and the dishonesty about firearms is staggering.
[03:30:07.235 --> 03:30:12.919]  And if you want to save children's lives, which all conscientious, caring people want to do, you don't go after lies.
[03:30:13.179 --> 03:30:16.782]  You go after reality and science and ballistic knowledge.
[03:30:17.203 --> 03:30:18.504]  None of them seem to have that.
[03:30:20.485 --> 03:30:23.928]  Here goes a couple shots.
[03:30:37.142 --> 03:30:37.602]  We'll kill him.
[03:30:37.622 --> 03:30:39.183]  Man, that sucker kicks.
[03:30:39.203 --> 03:30:40.063]  Yeah, really a lot of power.
[03:30:40.083 --> 03:30:41.083]  The boost gun could have done this.
[03:30:41.103 --> 03:30:42.004]  Fire in the hole, you clear?
[03:31:08.427 --> 03:31:16.853]  Well, on my Facebook every day, I salute entrepreneurs across this country that sacrifice and take risks to start business and employ people and be in the asset column.
[03:31:17.253 --> 03:31:18.934]  And the Nugent family has always stood by that.
[03:31:18.974 --> 03:31:20.876]  We've always worked and earned our own way.
[03:31:21.436 --> 03:31:26.279]  And when you stand up for the Second Amendment, all of a sudden you have Ammo with your name on it.
[03:31:26.480 --> 03:31:29.241]  And I have Gold Tip Arrows with my signature.
[03:31:29.582 --> 03:31:31.503]  And I have my Nuge Java.
[03:31:31.523 --> 03:31:32.424]  But bottom line is,
[03:31:33.084 --> 03:31:36.866]  Working hard, playing hard, America is alive and well, and I'm just proud to be one of them.
[03:31:37.106 --> 03:31:42.589]  Shemaine and I get up early every day, we work really hard every day, and then we snuggle at night and get ready to start over tomorrow.
[03:31:42.889 --> 03:31:49.732]  So I'm just here to salute people who really earn their position in the asset column of America.
[03:31:49.912 --> 03:31:51.813]  And when you see my audiences at the concert,
[03:31:53.293 --> 03:31:54.414]  It has a life of its own.
[03:31:54.454 --> 03:31:57.554]  It's literally a firestorm of ferocity.
[03:31:57.934 --> 03:32:03.656]  My music and my band and my audiences love real American soul music and rock and roll music and rhythm and blues.
[03:32:04.036 --> 03:32:09.977]  And this is, it's 2018, and this is the best year of my life, in spite of the crazy world around us.
[03:32:10.057 --> 03:32:21.500]  And I think, to some degree, because of the crazy world around us, you see dishonesty and ignorance and hate and rot and evil and nastiness from the left.
[03:32:22.040 --> 03:32:25.021]  And it makes you really confident that you're doing good.
[03:32:25.521 --> 03:32:30.182]  There's a colloquialism, a battle cry that I always end up with.
[03:32:31.422 --> 03:32:35.063]  Sometimes you give the world the best you got and you get kicked in the teeth.
[03:32:36.023 --> 03:32:37.703]  Give the world the best you got anyway.
[03:32:39.563 --> 03:32:43.924]  Coming to the InfoWars, Ted Nugent's The Music Made Me Do It.
[03:32:44.424 --> 03:32:47.045]  Exclusively at InfoWars.com.
[03:33:05.706 --> 03:33:11.949]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.

[03:33:29.810 --> 03:33:30.330]  We are live.
[03:33:30.390 --> 03:33:32.291]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.311 --> 03:33:46.519]  Before I play the CNN video, my response to CNN here in a moment, I want to tell you about the great specials available as part of our crusade to crush CNN's effort to defeat InfoWars.

[03:35:05.045 --> 03:35:08.647]  BuzzFeed, CNN, hate it when you get these products.
[03:35:09.047 --> 03:35:13.969]  CNN did a big hit piece saying all these advertisers were pulling out of our YouTube channel.
[03:35:14.469 --> 03:35:16.950]  Like they thought that would bring it, like what?
[03:35:17.699 --> 03:35:20.481]  You don't even have any videos monetized at this point.
[03:35:20.541 --> 03:35:22.503]  It's like 90% demonetized.
[03:35:23.003 --> 03:35:31.069]  I think in one case, they pointed to an example where we'd lost like $168 from an advertiser pulling a video off of YouTube.
[03:35:31.089 --> 03:35:33.871]  I mean, total idiocy.
[03:35:34.431 --> 03:35:36.052]  We survived by you getting the products.
[03:35:36.093 --> 03:35:37.313]  They can't stop that.
[03:35:37.814 --> 03:35:42.978]  They can't stop that, which is why they hate it when you buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:42.998 --> 03:35:43.398]  30% to 80% off.
[03:35:46.957 --> 03:35:49.059]  Infowarsstore.com, support us today.
[03:35:49.539 --> 03:35:52.222]  Let's go to the CNN video.
[03:35:52.442 --> 03:35:54.143]  This is my response to CNN.
[03:35:54.163 --> 03:35:55.625]  We'll come back after and talk about it.
[03:35:55.685 --> 03:35:56.806]  Here is the video.
[03:35:57.826 --> 03:36:01.189]  Yours truly has come under attack from CNN.
[03:36:01.229 --> 03:36:04.712]  They say, wait for it, they say I'm not mainstream.
[03:36:04.772 --> 03:36:10.237]  I appeared on Breitbart Radio and CNN's senior media reporter responded with this.
[03:36:10.337 --> 03:36:13.520]  I'm old enough to remember when Breitbart was trying to go mainstream.
[03:36:13.720 --> 03:36:14.641]  Guess they gave up.
[03:36:14.821 --> 03:36:17.603]  What exactly is mainstream these days?
[03:36:17.623 --> 03:36:25.007]  I mean, I know I come out with some edgy opinions from time to time, but I could never compete with CNN as saying something offensive.
[03:36:25.287 --> 03:36:32.931]  Then, there's heaping praise on somebody who represents a brutal dictatorship that incarcerates, tortures and executes hundreds of thousands of political dissidents.
[03:36:33.091 --> 03:36:34.152]  That's pretty edgy.
[03:36:34.232 --> 03:36:36.913]  Is that what constitutes being mainstream now?
[03:36:37.153 --> 03:36:42.056]  Genuflecting in front of a despotic regime that starves its own population to death?
[03:36:42.236 --> 03:36:43.437]  So, mainstream.
[03:36:43.497 --> 03:36:53.747]  Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but last time I checked, I don't think InfoWars or Breitbart were fawning over a country that has no independent media functioning civil society or religious freedom.
[03:36:53.767 --> 03:36:54.828]  That's CNN's job.
[03:37:01.560 --> 03:37:02.621]  So mainstream.
[03:37:02.661 --> 03:37:05.643]  Maybe I'd be more mainstream if I encouraged cuckoldry.
[03:37:05.703 --> 03:37:07.584]  Apparently that's mainstream now too.
[03:37:07.624 --> 03:37:15.288]  But you know, when your primetime shows get less viewers than decades-old reruns of Yogi Bear cartoons, I guess you gotta spice it up a bit.
[03:37:15.348 --> 03:37:21.732]  Mal, I went on to heap praise on one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists, describing him as a smart guy and someone who is wildly popular.
[03:37:21.852 --> 03:37:27.758]  The second half of that, I'm not going to argue with, but calling me one of the world's leading conspiracy theorists.
[03:37:27.858 --> 03:37:39.088]  Don't know if you've noticed, but in virtually every video I've made about big events for the past three years, I've debunked conspiracy theories here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
[03:37:39.168 --> 03:37:42.652]  Did I believe in some pretty out there conspiracy theories when I was younger?
[03:37:42.992 --> 03:37:44.273]  Yeah, then I grew up.
[03:37:44.353 --> 03:37:49.635]  But see, there's quite a big difference between my conspiracy theories and those pushed by CNN.
[03:37:49.775 --> 03:37:54.697]  I didn't help promote the conspiracy theory that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[03:37:54.717 --> 03:38:03.400]  A conspiracy theory that led to hundreds of thousands of dead Iraqis, thousands of dead and maimed US troops, a ruined country, and the rise of ISIS.
[03:38:03.660 --> 03:38:04.980]  It's not CNN that did that!
[03:38:05.180 --> 03:38:11.782]  I didn't promote the conspiracy theory that Libyan militias and moderate rebels in Syria were freedom fighters.
[03:38:11.822 --> 03:38:14.622]  There is a significant amount of moderate rebels.
[03:38:14.762 --> 03:38:19.163]  When in reality they were Islamic Jihadists, Al Qaeda and ISIS fanatics.
[03:38:19.243 --> 03:38:27.005]  A conspiracy theory that led to two ruined countries, the destabilization of an entire region of the world, and an international migrant crisis.
[03:38:27.125 --> 03:38:28.726]  Oh wait, that was CNN, wasn't it?
[03:38:28.947 --> 03:38:32.109]  I didn't promote the hands-up-don't-shoot conspiracy theory.
[03:38:32.189 --> 03:38:37.634]  A conspiracy theory that led to riots, shootings and the worst race relations in 50 years.
[03:38:37.754 --> 03:38:43.559]  I'm not promoting the conspiracy theory that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians to steal an election.
[03:38:43.659 --> 03:38:49.384]  A conspiracy theory that's put the world at the greatest risk of nuclear war since the height of the Cold War.
[03:38:49.564 --> 03:38:51.526]  Now who was it that did that?
[03:38:54.645 --> 03:38:55.465]  Oh yeah, it was CNN.
[03:38:55.605 --> 03:38:59.527]  But why is CNN constantly, like, Russia this, Russia that?
[03:39:00.147 --> 03:39:01.147]  Because it's ratings.
[03:39:01.307 --> 03:39:10.571]  I'm not promoting the conspiracy theory that socialism, which has caused untold misery everywhere in the world where it's been tried, is cool!
[03:39:11.411 --> 03:39:11.871]  Yeah.
[03:39:12.051 --> 03:39:13.071]  Yeah, CNN again.
[03:39:13.732 --> 03:39:23.195]  I didn't promote the conspiracy theory that Trump was igniting civil war while endorsing Antifa, a violent domestic terrorist group that advocates for
[03:39:24.864 --> 03:39:25.625]  Hmm... Civil War.
[03:39:25.665 --> 03:39:26.625]  Who was it that did that?
[03:39:26.645 --> 03:39:28.206]  It wasn't... It wasn't CNN.
[03:39:28.246 --> 03:39:28.946]  Yeah, it was CNN.
[03:39:29.066 --> 03:39:33.948]  I didn't promote the conspiracy theory that the president was deranged or physically unfit.
[03:39:34.008 --> 03:39:37.929]  Nor did I continue to promote it after it had been completely debunked.
[03:39:40.851 --> 03:39:41.731]  Wonder who did that?
[03:39:43.877 --> 03:39:45.078]  Not sure, surely not.
[03:39:45.398 --> 03:39:45.879]  Yeah, CNN.
[03:39:45.939 --> 03:39:55.168]  I mean, you guys say that the very existence of the Deep State, a manifestly provable entity in American politics since Eisenhower, is a conspiracy theory.
[03:39:55.188 --> 03:40:01.774]  You said the DNC and the Hillary campaign funding the Pegate dossier, a proven fact, was a conspiracy theory.
[03:40:01.794 --> 03:40:06.678]  So maybe you're not in the best position to be lecturing others about conspiracy theories.
[03:40:06.718 --> 03:40:07.519]  Let me remind you.
[03:40:07.699 --> 03:40:14.121]  That CNN is actively lobbying for a competing news organisation to be shut down.
[03:40:14.281 --> 03:40:17.522]  In Russia, the government shuts down dissident media outlets.
[03:40:17.602 --> 03:40:21.764]  In the United States, CNN apparently thinks that that's its responsibility.
[03:40:21.884 --> 03:40:27.225]  Can anyone tell me why InfoWars is on the verge of being deleted for bullying and harassment?
[03:40:27.265 --> 03:40:35.688]  But CNN can literally turn up at an old lady's home, dox, bully and harass her for the thought crime of posting memes on Facebook.
[03:40:35.828 --> 03:40:39.771]  And then post the video on YouTube with no consequences whatsoever.
[03:40:39.871 --> 03:40:40.991]  Strange that, isn't it?
[03:40:41.011 --> 03:40:44.193]  It's almost like there's one rule for them and another rule for us.
[03:40:44.233 --> 03:40:51.838]  CNN threatened to expose a private citizen for posting the Trump wrestling meme if he failed to display the proper amount of remorse.
[03:40:51.978 --> 03:40:57.362]  Sounds like it's perfectly acceptable to engage in bullying and harassment so long as you're called CNN.
[03:40:57.402 --> 03:41:03.266]  Not content with campaigning for our entire channel to be terminated because we dared challenge their narrative on
[03:41:04.969 --> 03:41:10.052]  Now CNN is tracking down advertisers on InfoWars videos and trying to bully them too.
[03:41:10.132 --> 03:41:13.534]  Because we really make so much money off YouTube ads at this point.
[03:41:13.574 --> 03:41:17.236]  Not like 90% plus of our content is already demonetized anyway.
[03:41:17.296 --> 03:41:18.917]  However are we gonna survive?
[03:41:18.957 --> 03:41:23.680]  CNN is like a bitter, jealous ex-girlfriend that just won't leave us alone.
[03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:27.622]  Remember when they hid behind bushes to stalk Trump at that golf course?
[03:41:27.642 --> 03:41:29.763]  Well now they're obsessed with InfoWars.
[03:41:29.783 --> 03:41:30.984]  But to be honest, CNN...
[03:41:31.644 --> 03:41:33.006]  You're just not our type.
[03:41:33.206 --> 03:41:37.813]  We just don't have much in common with a network that thinks the American people are stupid as ****.
[03:41:38.334 --> 03:41:42.800]  But if that's a question of the intellect of the American voters, I think they're stupid as ****.
[03:41:43.020 --> 03:41:43.941]  Look, it's not you.
[03:41:44.342 --> 03:41:44.703]  It's us.
[03:41:45.990 --> 03:41:46.811]  No, wait, it's you.
[03:41:46.891 --> 03:41:47.711]  It's definitely you.
[03:41:47.731 --> 03:41:53.856]  So take your conspiracy theories, you know the ones that start wars, continent-wide crises and domestic unrest.
[03:41:53.936 --> 03:41:54.797]  Yeah, those.
[03:41:54.837 --> 03:42:00.301]  Take your little Infowars obsession, take your crusade against our YouTube channel and shove it!
[03:42:00.321 --> 03:42:04.584]  Maybe then you can concentrate on, oh, I don't know, being an actual news network.
[03:42:04.664 --> 03:42:05.705]  Remember those days?
[03:42:06.906 --> 03:42:07.647]  No, me neither.
[03:42:11.189 --> 03:42:11.670]  That is...
[03:42:12.711 --> 03:42:16.574]  The video, CNN attacks PJW, it's up on YouTube, you can get it right now.
[03:42:16.594 --> 03:42:27.542]  There's also an article on Breitbart, by the way, CNN turns to outright gangsterism to silence Jones, in which the writer makes the point, you know, YouTube's a private company, Google's a private company, even though it's a monopoly.
[03:42:28.180 --> 03:42:29.481]  But social media is different.
[03:42:29.561 --> 03:42:34.266]  Imagine if 50 years ago a private company purchased the US mail and telephone company.
[03:42:34.506 --> 03:42:40.191]  Now imagine if they monitored and censored our communications based on their partisan speech codes.
[03:42:40.231 --> 03:42:45.697]  How is that any different from what corporate fascists in Silicon Valley are up to right now?
[03:42:45.997 --> 03:42:50.962]  So this my private company argument, it's gone out the window a long time ago.
[03:42:51.502 --> 03:42:55.145]  We'll be back on the other side to talk about North Korea and the Italian elections.
[03:42:55.205 --> 03:42:58.047]  This is the Alex Jones Show live at Infowars.com.
[03:42:58.368 --> 03:42:58.928]  Don't go away.
[03:42:58.948 --> 03:42:59.649]  We'll be back.
[03:43:02.478 --> 03:43:03.940]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[03:45:02.065 --> 03:45:13.594]  I knew about iodine a long time ago and the effects of iodine because looking at, again, the root cause of what's going on, we are all exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals every single day.
[03:45:13.654 --> 03:45:14.595]  We're exposed to lead.
[03:45:14.635 --> 03:45:15.676]  We're exposed to mercury.
[03:45:15.696 --> 03:45:20.700]  We're exposed to bromine, chlorine, and fluoride, the other toxic halogens.
[03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:26.084]  But think about what's going on right now in America and around the world.
[03:45:26.184 --> 03:45:28.306]  What does an iodine deficiency do?
[03:45:29.106 --> 03:45:30.487]  Well, it causes you to gain weight.
[03:45:30.607 --> 03:45:34.229]  Think of all the thyroid problems that we're having and we're seeing right now around the world.
[03:45:34.349 --> 03:45:39.332]  Our bodies absolutely must have the good halogen, iodine, or we will die.
[03:45:39.692 --> 03:45:45.175]  And you look at all of the thyroid problems and all the people that don't have energy, that have all sorts of hormone problems.
[03:45:45.535 --> 03:45:50.758]  And from my research, and a lot of just mainline research, it leads back to iodine over
[03:45:51.118 --> 03:45:52.078]  And over and over again.
[03:45:52.138 --> 03:45:59.020]  If you've been in this field as long as I have, like 20-something years, you know it's very hard to detoxify and to get those things out of the body.
[03:45:59.261 --> 03:46:01.441]  Iodine is one of those miracle substances.
[03:46:01.461 --> 03:46:03.102]  I mean, this is so massive.
[03:46:03.182 --> 03:46:16.486]  Just iodine alone is just as critical as vitamin C. I would say it's even more critical because you look at all of the glandular tissue in the body, the reproductive tissue, the ovaries, the breast tissue in women, the prostate gland in men.
[03:46:16.506 --> 03:46:17.126]  Fertility is key.
[03:46:17.706 --> 03:46:34.293]  Fertility, but all your glands are what really, your pituitary gland which gets calcified with fluoride, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the GI tract actually, the whole GI tract is a gland that needs iodine because the GI tract produces serotonin and all these things.
[03:46:34.673 --> 03:46:38.675]  Iodine is the miracle substance that pretty much everybody needs.
[03:46:38.695 --> 03:46:44.157]  When you're carrying your kid on your shoulder up a big hill and you get up to take him off, it's like you're flying, all of a sudden it was like BOOM!
[03:46:44.617 --> 03:46:46.038]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:23.710 --> 03:47:30.313]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:30.713 --> 03:47:35.735]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:35.875 --> 03:47:40.237]  We are live for the final segment of The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:40.537 --> 03:47:43.238]  Remember, War Room is coming up next, so stay tuned for that.
[03:47:43.498 --> 03:47:44.859]  But let's get into North Korea.
[03:47:44.899 --> 03:47:45.979]  Do you remember back?
[03:47:46.419 --> 03:47:48.040]  I think it was in early January.
[03:47:48.746 --> 03:47:58.634]  When President Trump tweeted, to the horror of the peanut gallery press and the leftists, that he was prepared to use his nuclear button when it came to North Korea.
[03:47:59.275 --> 03:48:01.237]  Let's flashback and read that tweet actually.
[03:48:02.057 --> 03:48:07.602]  Trump said, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un just stated that the nuclear button is on his desk at all times.
[03:48:07.962 --> 03:48:16.990]  Will someone from his depleted and food-starved regime, which CNN loves by the way and fawns over and worships their mainstream, please inform him that I too have a nuclear button
[03:48:17.631 --> 03:48:21.515]  But it is a much bigger and more powerful one than his, and my button works.
[03:48:22.195 --> 03:48:25.578]  Now, what was the reaction to that at the time?
[03:48:26.459 --> 03:48:35.868]  Let's go to this MSNBC video where the analyst literally says, this tweet threatens to make the planet uninhabitable.
[03:48:35.888 --> 03:48:37.269]  That's literally what he said.
[03:48:37.709 --> 03:48:42.894]  That this tweet put the planet, the survival of the planet itself, at risk.
[03:48:42.954 --> 03:48:43.895]  Let's go to this video.
[03:48:45.072 --> 03:48:53.977]  This interesting thought from Donald Trump about the size of his nuclear button and the threat that he just put up against the North Korean leader.
[03:48:53.997 --> 03:48:54.397]  Your thoughts?
[03:48:54.997 --> 03:49:03.902]  As we saw all through 2017, men with profound sexual insecurity can wreak a lot of havoc in the lives of women, in the lives of their families.
[03:49:04.702 --> 03:49:09.245]  But perhaps never have we seen a man whose profound sexual and masculine
[03:49:09.725 --> 03:49:11.767]  He literally thought a tweet from Donald Trump
[03:49:38.300 --> 03:49:40.202]  Would make the planet uninhabitable.
[03:49:40.762 --> 03:49:43.105]  This is tough geopolitical posturing.
[03:49:43.885 --> 03:49:48.149]  Now, what was the response from other talking heads to Trump's tweet back in early January?
[03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:56.457]  Well, NBC News National Security Analyst Jeremy Bash said that it would cause Kim Jong-un to, quote, lash out.
[03:49:56.918 --> 03:49:58.199]  He said, quote, This is a tweet.
[03:49:58.860 --> 03:50:02.282]  That could lead to confrontation and maybe even war.
[03:50:02.722 --> 03:50:12.927]  Bear in mind, this is the same media that fearmongers every single day about Russia and invents conspiracies about Russian collusion that have put the planet at the greatest risk of nuclear war since the Cold War.
[03:50:13.327 --> 03:50:21.791]  Oh, but when it comes to Trump tweeting, no, that's going to lead to war, according to NBC national security analyst Jeremy Bash.
[03:50:22.492 --> 03:50:26.814]  What did CNN's Brian Stelter say in response to this tweet?
[03:50:27.481 --> 03:50:30.663]  He said that it was evidence that Trump was mentally unstable.
[03:50:31.424 --> 03:50:35.186]  What would we say if the leader of Germany or China or Brazil posted tweets like Trump's?
[03:50:35.566 --> 03:50:36.347]  How would we cover it?
[03:50:36.567 --> 03:50:38.008]  We'd say that person is not well.
[03:50:39.150 --> 03:50:49.498]  Point being, they all completely freaked out over this tweet, said it was a horrific diplomatic blunder, that it was putting the planet at risk of being uninhabitable.
[03:50:49.778 --> 03:50:53.221]  What happened within hours of Trump sending out that tweet?
[03:50:53.741 --> 03:50:59.826]  Well, North Korea re-established communications with South Korea for the first time in nearly two years.
[03:51:00.266 --> 03:51:02.028]  What happened today?
[03:51:03.429 --> 03:51:03.909]  Headline.
[03:51:04.069 --> 03:51:04.630]  Breakthrough.
[03:51:05.350 --> 03:51:10.052]  North Korea ready to denuclearise if regime safety is guaranteed.
[03:51:10.172 --> 03:51:11.172]  This is zero hedge.
[03:51:11.853 --> 03:51:20.756]  Score another diplomatic victory for Trump, whose hardline negotiating tactic appears to have generated a dramatic and favourable outcome.
[03:51:21.440 --> 03:51:37.432]  An outcome that the Financial Times dubbed a diplomatic breakthrough, that North and South Korea have agreed to hold direct talks between their leaders, with North Korea signalling it is willing to abandon its nuclear programme if regime security can be guaranteed.
[03:51:38.273 --> 03:51:39.634]  The markets are loving it.
[03:51:40.354 --> 03:51:47.039]  It's a tough geopolitical stance by Trump that increased the likelihood that this would happen.
[03:51:47.359 --> 03:51:47.980]  In other words,
[03:51:48.832 --> 03:51:51.453]  Not just the tweet, but the tweet worked.
[03:51:52.074 --> 03:51:54.495]  They immediately started to back away.
[03:51:55.015 --> 03:52:06.100]  Now they're in talks to denuclearise entirely, as opposed to Obama who just made it worse, as opposed to Clinton back in the 90s who gave them the technology to build the nukes in the first place.
[03:52:07.282 --> 03:52:12.445]  So again, the mainstream media has been completely debunked with its hysteria.
[03:52:12.845 --> 03:52:14.766]  They said this could lead to global war.
[03:52:15.086 --> 03:52:16.567]  They said it was a horrific mistake.
[03:52:16.847 --> 03:52:20.849]  They've been proven wrong once again by reality.
[03:52:21.747 --> 03:52:33.174]  Absolutely incredible but we're making great progress on North Korea by taking an actual stance against them and they appear, although it's often not certain of course, but they appear to be backing away.
[03:52:33.394 --> 03:52:37.516]  What Trump's doing is working and the mainstream media are just going to have to deal with that.
[03:52:37.817 --> 03:52:39.398]  They've been completely debunked.
[03:52:41.119 --> 03:52:46.782]  Let's move on to Italy where of course the populist party and the centre-right coalition swept
[03:52:47.617 --> 03:52:54.779]  To power, obviously only one of them can take power, but the centre-left Democrats, the globalist party, was completely decimated.
[03:52:55.039 --> 03:52:58.140]  They performed even worse than the polls suggested.
[03:52:58.160 --> 03:53:11.384]  So now you're going to have a jockeying for position between the populist Five Star Movement and the centre-right coalition, which is Forza Italia and the Northern League, led by Matteo Salvini.
[03:53:11.404 --> 03:53:12.684]  And actually, Salvini won.
[03:53:13.422 --> 03:53:16.625]  In the duel between the two parties in the right-wing coalition.
[03:53:17.205 --> 03:53:23.470]  So if it comes to that coalition taking power, Salvini will be the Prime Minister.
[03:53:23.951 --> 03:53:31.637]  Massive rejection of globalism, massive rejection of open borders, massive rejection of the European Union.
[03:53:32.197 --> 03:53:34.379]  Now, how was it reported in the immediate aftermath?
[03:53:34.399 --> 03:53:36.401]  Well, who's to blame?
[03:53:37.409 --> 03:53:41.995]  For this crushing populist victory in Italy, what were the consequences that led to it?
[03:53:42.396 --> 03:53:48.264]  Was it the horrific migrant wave that was pouring into Italy, pouring into their southern towns from Libya?
[03:53:49.133 --> 03:53:54.998]  Did it have anything to do with the fact that their economy is in complete malaise, they've still got massive unemployment?
[03:53:55.458 --> 03:54:00.001]  Was it anything to do with the fact that they've got a horrible relationship with the EU and it's not working for them?
[03:54:00.382 --> 03:54:00.582]  No.
[03:54:01.202 --> 03:54:03.644]  Italian voters didn't vote based on any of that.
[03:54:04.004 --> 03:54:05.726]  It was all thanks to Russia.
[03:54:06.226 --> 03:54:10.750]  Oh yes, the mo-Russian conspiracy theory is back once again.
[03:54:11.690 --> 03:54:12.711]  This is zero hedge.
[03:54:12.831 --> 03:54:15.053]  Russia blamed for Italian election outcome.
[03:54:15.757 --> 03:54:26.260]  If there's a European election and the anti-establishment party score a stunning victory, as just happened in Italy a few months prior in Austria, and in Germany, by the way, who are you going to blame?
[03:54:27.201 --> 03:54:28.981]  Vladimir Putin, of course.
[03:54:29.121 --> 03:54:43.006]  That's what Samantha Power, one of the top diplomats in the Obama administration, did when she shared an article by Spain's El País newspaper about how Russia predetermined the outcome of Sunday's election by spinning an immigrant discourse in Italy.
[03:54:44.688 --> 03:54:56.088]  So because some Russian news outlets talked about the fact that Italy had a problem with mass immigration, with literally like 20-something year old girls being butchered and cannibalized,
[03:54:57.017 --> 03:55:00.518]  Which happened, I think it was in Rome or another big Italian city a few weeks ago.
[03:55:00.538 --> 03:55:02.379]  They actually found that they cannibalised the woman.
[03:55:03.139 --> 03:55:04.900]  It was a migrant that carried out the murder.
[03:55:05.380 --> 03:55:09.881]  Massive problems with this onrush of immigrants from Libya, people smugglers.
[03:55:10.381 --> 03:55:12.522]  Now, that's all, that didn't happen.
[03:55:12.702 --> 03:55:14.022]  Nobody voted on that basis.
[03:55:14.062 --> 03:55:16.963]  They voted because Russia talked about it in their media.
[03:55:17.724 --> 03:55:18.724]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:55:19.184 --> 03:55:23.666]  By the way, Samantha Power's all concerned about foreign interventions.
[03:55:23.706 --> 03:55:24.846]  This is the same woman
[03:55:25.845 --> 03:55:35.793]  It was a water carrier for the US intervention under Obama into Libya, a complete disaster which led to the migrant crisis in the first place.
[03:55:36.314 --> 03:55:40.057]  Oh, but now she's up there whining about foreign intervention.
[03:55:40.517 --> 03:55:43.620]  She's the queen of foreign intervention, trying to claim that
[03:55:44.378 --> 03:55:52.863]  Russia talking about the problems Italy has in its media is why people voted for populist parties, why people voted for centre-right parties.
[03:55:53.283 --> 03:55:58.226]  No, it's because they have massive problems with migration, massive problems with their economy.
[03:55:58.426 --> 03:55:59.387]  They've got 38% youth unemployment.
[03:56:01.528 --> 03:56:03.409]  They've got a terrible relationship with the EU.
[03:56:03.589 --> 03:56:04.850]  They've got a record debt load.
[03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:10.172]  They voted for change because their country was going down the toilet.
[03:56:10.412 --> 03:56:14.394]  It had nothing to do with Marussia, Samantha Power.
[03:56:14.854 --> 03:56:15.955]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:56:18.186 --> 03:56:22.330]  Majority of Italian youngsters backed Eurosceptic anti-establishment parties.
[03:56:22.390 --> 03:56:23.391]  I talked about this earlier.
[03:56:23.431 --> 03:56:27.014]  Conservatism is the new counterculture, not just culturally, but politically.
[03:56:27.394 --> 03:56:34.921]  We saw the same thing in France, remember, where 44% of youngsters backed Marine Le Pen, the populist candidate.
[03:56:36.082 --> 03:56:43.449]  Now, youngsters in Italy voted overwhelmingly in favour of Eurosceptic anti-mass migration parties in the country's election on Sunday.
[03:56:44.304 --> 03:56:58.570]  According to a survey by Techneg, a whopping 44% of those aged 18 to 30 backed the Five Star Movement, whilst a further 13% voted for the anti-Euro Liga, which is Matteo Salvini.
[03:56:58.610 --> 03:56:59.910]  He's probably going to be the next leader.
[03:57:00.591 --> 03:57:13.296]  Another 3% of youngsters backed Nationalist Brothers of Italy, meaning that in total 60% of young Italians backed parties critical of the Euro, anti-establishment and anti-mass migration.
[03:57:14.304 --> 03:57:21.688]  So again, the Euroskeptic Rebellion, fuelled by young Europeans, continues to surge across the continent.
[03:57:22.108 --> 03:57:24.429]  This is fundamentally a youth movement.
[03:57:24.890 --> 03:57:29.752]  It's growing, it's becoming more pervasive, it's resonating with young people.
[03:57:30.032 --> 03:57:34.295]  Just like Infowars, just like my YouTube channel, is resonating with young people.
[03:57:34.835 --> 03:57:41.999]  And that's why the establishment haters, they are in a blind panic because their audience is literally dying.
[03:57:43.047 --> 03:57:46.475]  How Enjoy Your Width War Room is coming up next on InfoWallace.com.
[03:57:46.515 --> 03:57:52.429]  For all the breaking news, we'll be back in a go away.
[03:57:55.839 --> 03:58:02.622]  This is the best deal we've ever offered on our flagship product, DNA Force.
[03:58:02.762 --> 03:58:04.622]  And it's got a very interesting story behind it.
[03:58:04.762 --> 03:58:10.845]  I was at a medical doctor's clinic facility that had top-of-the-line nutraceuticals and was noticing that they were $200 to $400.
[03:58:11.145 --> 03:58:21.269]  And then I talked to my dad about it, who is a physician, and he said, absolutely, this is the biggest area in nutraceuticals and supplements is longevity and keeping your telomeres in place.
[03:58:21.289 --> 03:58:24.110]  You can't make telomeres grow, you can just make them not shrink as fast.
[03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.470]  Well, I
[03:58:24.790 --> 03:58:46.037]  Designed DNA Force with Dr. Group, and Dr. Group's a great guy, but then we were gonna come out with Cell Force because I was able to find just as good of the same compounds for a lower price, and was able to develop Cell Force, and Group liked the formula so much, he said, listen, we were gonna come out with DNA Force Plus, you just use that name and do it, because this is such an incredible formula.
[03:58:46.557 --> 03:58:52.107]  And I understand you're going to one of the biggest labs in the country, and so you were able to scale up and lower price, and I want to do that.
[03:58:52.488 --> 03:58:57.737]  He was so classy, he just said, you just put out DNA Force Plus as Cell Force, or vice versa.
[03:58:57.817 --> 03:58:58.839]  I was partnering with him on that.
[03:58:58.859 --> 03:58:59.821]  That's how classy he is.
