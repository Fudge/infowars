[00:00:04.016 --> 00:00:06.999]  We are now only 22 days out from the midterms.
[00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:18.208]  And the amount of disinformation and globalist psychological warfare is simply mind-blowing.
[00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.391]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:00:23.032 --> 00:00:25.574]  You know, Variety told the truth.
[00:00:27.656 --> 00:00:29.718]  60 Minutes was outmatched by Trump.
[00:00:30.438 --> 00:00:31.899]  Trump bulldozed
[00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:33.844]  His enemies.
[00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:37.486]  Trump bulldozed his enemies.
[00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:41.687]  And that's because they didn't heavily edit him.
[00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:46.789]  Because they know he has a pulpit to counter them.
[00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.110]  And that's why they want to censor everybody else.
[00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.692]  So that when they lie about other conservatives, Christians, nationalists, and patriots, we can't respond back.
[00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:58.813]  That's the big secret of why they wanted me deplatformed.
[00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:01.534]  And when enough people didn't stand up, like Congress,
[00:01:03.148 --> 00:01:04.629]  The President stood up and said it was wrong.
[00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.792]  But when the Congress and other conservatives didn't stand up, Drudge did.
[00:01:10.813 --> 00:01:11.794]  Tucker Carlson did.
[00:01:12.554 --> 00:01:14.476]  But when others didn't stand up, it was greenlighted.
[00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:21.320]  So thousands and thousands and thousands of prominent conservative and Christian and nationalist groups banned off Twitter and Facebook.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.622]  It was 800 on Thursday, thousands on Tuesday.
[00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:32.428]  But you see, the President, if you edit his comments out of context, he comes after you in press conferences and on Twitter.
[00:01:34.392 --> 00:01:48.042]  So now, in multiple articles I saw today, without even looking, so it must be a lot of criticism, they're mad at 60 Minutes for not showing more negative comments in association with what Trump had to say.
[00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:49.784]  Don't let him actually be heard!
[00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:54.667]  Heavily edit him and then only have him be heard when someone else is on there attacking him.
[00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:57.089]  You know, national studies say 93%
[00:01:59.637 --> 00:02:01.518]  of media coverage of the president is negative.
[00:02:02.098 --> 00:02:07.201]  When Kanye quotes that, they call him a dumb negro on CNN.
[00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:08.382]  That's right.
[00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:09.543]  They said, oh, he's dumb.
[00:02:09.823 --> 00:02:10.583]  That's not true.
[00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:12.765]  Yeah, he said 90 percent.
[00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:15.746]  He said over 90 percent.
[00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:16.747]  It's 93.
[00:02:17.427 --> 00:02:19.208]  But so you think your audience is dumb.
[00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:20.469]  You know Kanye's not dumb.
[00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:21.450]  He's self-made.
[00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:27.474]  Don Lemon and other jerks, they have to work in the system and then sit there and say how Kanye's wrong.
[00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:29.576]  But see, Kanye has a platform too.
[00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:30.717]  He can respond back.
[00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:31.637]  Not as much as the President.
[00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:33.859]  And I have a platform.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.603]  Even though they tried to censor me, because of you getting the word out, it's blown up in their face.
[00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:39.204]  So what's going to happen next?
[00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:42.647]  Well, this right to respond is critical to everything.
[00:02:42.968 --> 00:02:43.809]  To be able to punch back.
[00:02:44.687 --> 00:02:47.369]  When he punches back, they say, oh, he's trying to censor us.
[00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.689]  He's going to get us killed.
[00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.110]  He wants the press shut down.
[00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.151]  He never said that.
[00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:52.572]  He said, you're fake news.
[00:02:55.133 --> 00:03:01.917]  When you lie about him every day, and he responded back, and you claim that's an attack on the First Amendment when it's mainstream corporate media pushing all the censorship.
[00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:07.680]  But again, NBC backtracks on Trump, Robert E. Lee comments.
[00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.063]  We're going to cover that when we come back after the first break.
[00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:13.964]  They came out and they said, yeah, he attacked
[00:03:15.512 --> 00:03:25.136]  Ulysses S. Grant, and he sided with the South, and anybody with half a brain could actually watch the video and see that he did the opposite.
[00:03:26.937 --> 00:03:31.699]  And so NBC had to retract because they don't have air superiority.
[00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:39.482]  Because we have the president, the only person to completely punch through their wall of lies, become mythical,
[00:03:40.598 --> 00:03:44.279]  Like Hercules, politically, and now to be our champion.
[00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.579]  And that's why they want to bring him down.
[00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:47.439]  It's why there's new assassination threats.
[00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.761]  That's why they are so upset and lining up more fake women to come forward, more Jane Does to lie after the midterms.
[00:03:55.801 --> 00:04:02.283]  And the Democrats are panicking because a lot of internal polls show they're going to lose the midterms despite people voting in the names of dead people.
[00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:05.443]  And so they're in full panic mode right now.
[00:04:05.463 --> 00:04:07.924]  But you see, if Trump couldn't respond back,
[00:04:08.988 --> 00:04:12.450]  They would continue to say that he attacked the North and loves the South.
[00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.431]  When he was transcending that.
[00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:16.131]  This is what they do.
[00:04:16.491 --> 00:04:19.393]  But because he could respond, they don't know what to do.
[00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:21.894]  And that's the secret of Trump getting into the White House.
[00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:23.335]  And that's why they're so scared.
[00:04:23.815 --> 00:04:25.776]  That's why they want Infowars.com shut down.
[00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:28.197]  That's why they want DrudgeReport.com shut down.
[00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:30.818]  Because they don't want us to be able to point out their lies.
[00:04:31.098 --> 00:04:31.859]  I know that's simple.
[00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:33.299]  But it's profound.
[00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:34.320]  We'll be back.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.780]  Stay with us.
[00:04:41.348 --> 00:04:43.034]  What are champions made of?
[00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:45.905]  Here's a man who can show you.

[00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:28.146]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:53.863]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:05:54.603 --> 00:05:56.524]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:05:57.064 --> 00:06:02.885]  It is Monday, the 15th day of October 2018.
[00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:05.786]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:12.887 --> 00:06:15.150]  And we are in your hands, listeners and viewers.
[00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.935]  Without your support of the broadcast, InfoWars will not thrive.
[00:06:18.995 --> 00:06:20.677]  InfoWars will implode.
[00:06:21.058 --> 00:06:27.106]  InfoWars will be destroyed by George Soros and the giant globalist combine led by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[00:06:27.807 --> 00:06:35.394]  But because of your continued support and your prayers, we are here, and in many ways, we're stronger and more battle-tested and battle-hardened than ever.
[00:06:35.814 --> 00:06:43.941]  So I salute you all, across the United States, across the world, whether you have black skin or white skin, whether you're Asian, whether you're in Latin America, it doesn't matter.
[00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:46.704]  If you love liberty and you love freedom, I salute you.
[00:06:47.144 --> 00:06:51.188]  Now, here's the really good news up front.
[00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:54.350]  Every election in the last two years,
[00:06:55.538 --> 00:07:16.884]  In France, and in Germany, and in Italy, and in the Netherlands, and in Sweden, and in England, and in Brazil, and the list goes on and on, has gone against the globalists, and against leftists, and against people that want open borders, and that want massive tax increases.
[00:07:17.864 --> 00:07:22.866]  And they had another parliamentary election, and an election in Bavaria,
[00:07:25.157 --> 00:07:31.101]  Arguably the most important state in Deutschland, and Merkel's party completely lost.
[00:07:31.142 --> 00:07:35.405]  Now you say, she's been losing every election for two years, constantly.
[00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:38.287]  Why is she still the Chancellor?
[00:07:38.347 --> 00:07:41.369]  She's holding on by one little string.
[00:07:41.689 --> 00:07:43.851]  The globalist champion, Angela Merkel.
[00:07:44.892 --> 00:07:46.533]  Because they have more than 15 parties.
[00:07:47.474 --> 00:07:51.437]  She's able, with government power, to buy off other parties every time she loses.
[00:07:52.725 --> 00:07:56.028]  But now her coalition is so small, this is it.
[00:07:56.448 --> 00:08:00.811]  Even CNN says, it might be time for Angela Merkel to go.
[00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:03.934]  They put her on the cover of Time, the cover of Newsweek.
[00:08:03.954 --> 00:08:08.317]  They worshipped her as the anti-Trump, as the woman that would vanquish him.
[00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:11.540]  As the woman that would prop up unelected globalism.
[00:08:13.857 --> 00:08:18.498]  But she just lost yesterday in Sunday's elections massively.
[00:08:19.238 --> 00:08:20.659]  Every election.
[00:08:21.039 --> 00:08:24.079]  And the margins get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:08:24.119 --> 00:08:25.740]  She's losing state elections.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.780]  She's losing federal elections.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:37.722]  But every time she's got government power, she's able to go buy off another party or buy off another coalition of smaller parties to join her coalition.
[00:08:37.782 --> 00:08:39.763]  But now, she's out of gas.
[00:08:42.298 --> 00:08:44.580]  And the next federal election they have, she's gone.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:09:06.136]  And now all there is is a giant conservative and nationalist coalition with, wait for it, three of the liberal and socialist and communist parties joining the conservatives and nationalists in wanting to keep their own pensions and not have the socialism they set up taken from them.
[00:09:06.156 --> 00:09:08.358]  Because globalism is beyond even socialism.
[00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:10.960]  It's taking everything from you in the final phases.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:11.721]  And then,
[00:09:12.779 --> 00:09:19.870]  Bankrupting you by design to bring in full control and collapse while the EU bureaucracy is tax exempt.
[00:09:20.612 --> 00:09:21.193]  Think about that.
[00:09:21.733 --> 00:09:26.461]  Oh, and what's happened in other countries like Italy?
[00:09:27.321 --> 00:09:38.669]  Communists and socialists voting with the conservatives and the right wing and the nationalist parties for a new grand coalition, the strongest Italy seen in 50 years.
[00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:48.136]  Oh, and it's, again, anti-New World Order, and you've got the president and major members of parliament quoting InfoWars.com.
[00:09:48.756 --> 00:09:49.757]  Let's look at Brazil.
[00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:56.322]  Brazil, in its first round of elections, out of a field of more than 20 people,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:11.351]  The conservative, nationalist, Trump-type, pro-Second Amendment individual who got stabbed and almost murdered a month ago won by a huge margin and is set to be winning the presidency.
[00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:13.172]  Should I continue here?
[00:10:14.073 --> 00:10:15.254]  I have a stack of this.
[00:10:17.456 --> 00:10:24.342]  So, The Globalist said two years ago on the eve of the 2016 election in the Financial Times of London,
[00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:37.292]  And the New York Times and Atlantic Monthly and other establishment organs that put out the talking points, they said, if Hillary loses, globalism is done.
[00:10:40.395 --> 00:10:44.237]  The authoritarian system of globalism, unelected mega banks working with authoritarian regimes.
[00:10:44.537 --> 00:10:54.685]  And when she lost, they went from selling us out to China, to the stay-behind networks and the deep state groups in the Western world, literally completely rolling over to China
[00:10:55.675 --> 00:10:56.956]  And relocating there.
[00:10:57.697 --> 00:10:58.217]  In a panic.
[00:10:58.297 --> 00:10:59.438]  They already believe they've lost.
[00:10:59.878 --> 00:11:03.061]  They're in a rearguard action, moving officially to China.
[00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:06.483]  Google, Apple, but hundreds of other big companies.
[00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:08.905]  They have just said, we want authoritarianism.
[00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:09.606]  That's it.
[00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.968]  You'll never have America come back.
[00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:13.329]  We're just going to China.
[00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:21.656]  And China opened up her big, evil, stinking, buzzard wings, carrion wings, and said, come under mommy.
[00:11:22.096 --> 00:11:27.740]  So they're all sitting under her wings, her black wings, right now.
[00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:32.764]  And we're at war with China.
[00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.386]  Trump can't tell you that officially.
[00:11:35.467 --> 00:11:37.608]  Coming up next segment, I'll play part of the 60 Minutes interview.
[00:11:38.089 --> 00:11:39.310]  He can't tell you that.
[00:11:40.742 --> 00:11:42.023]  Because it would destroy confidence.
[00:11:42.203 --> 00:11:43.464]  But we're in a shooting war.
[00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:45.145]  We're in a space war.
[00:11:45.345 --> 00:11:46.606]  They're blowing up our satellites.
[00:11:46.666 --> 00:11:48.007]  We're blowing up their satellites.
[00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:51.289]  I can tell you right now, we're destroying their satellites a lot better than they're destroying ours.
[00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:53.731]  Space Force has been around for decades.
[00:11:54.211 --> 00:11:55.272]  Trump's just giving it a name.
[00:11:55.332 --> 00:11:58.994]  It's the military arm of NASA and Space Command and the Air Force.
[00:12:02.376 --> 00:12:03.617]  And we're in an economic war.
[00:12:04.358 --> 00:12:07.800]  And all the idiots that don't side with Trump, you're crazy.
[00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:10.982]  But you see the corporate media hitting him every day.
[00:12:11.122 --> 00:12:13.983]  They said that he came out and attacked the South and hates Robert E. Lee.
[00:12:14.344 --> 00:12:14.964]  Never said it.
[00:12:15.084 --> 00:12:15.944]  Totally not true.
[00:12:18.506 --> 00:12:21.167]  That was months ago they said he hated the South and hated Robert E. Lee.
[00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:23.108]  I was going back to that, memory-wise.
[00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:27.650]  Remember when they said that he secretly was recorded in the White House?
[00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:35.574]  And that Leaker said that he hates the South and hates dumb Southerners and thinks that the Attorney General is a moron?
[00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:36.895]  That wasn't true.
[00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:37.735]  Turned out that was a hoax.
[00:12:37.755 --> 00:12:38.816]  Well, now they've done the opposite.
[00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:45.368]  Now they say that he is attacking Ulysses S. Grant and hates him.
[00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:53.654]  They're hitting every demographic hot button they can, but NBC had to come out because the president has a platform.
[00:12:55.175 --> 00:12:56.176]  NBC had to come out.
[00:12:57.512 --> 00:13:00.093]  And go, okay, it's not true, it's praising Ulysses S. Grant.
[00:13:00.733 --> 00:13:01.574]  None of it's true, folks.
[00:13:01.974 --> 00:13:02.874]  He hates black people.
[00:13:02.914 --> 00:13:03.554]  He hates women.
[00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:04.635]  He hates Jews.
[00:13:04.915 --> 00:13:05.695]  He hates the South.
[00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:06.636]  He hates the North.
[00:13:06.876 --> 00:13:07.756]  He hates the... No!
[00:13:07.896 --> 00:13:11.217]  He hates globalists and control freaks and anti-American scum.
[00:13:12.858 --> 00:13:17.500]  Now we're gonna go to break with a fun little piece that Millie Weaver put together.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.382]  And then when we come back, I'm gonna plunge into the 60 Minutes interview where he bulldozed over the globalists.
[00:13:24.124 --> 00:13:28.105]  And then we're also going to get into what's really happening in Saudi Arabia.
[00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:38.548]  You noticed on Friday and on Sunday I said evidence shows there's a false flag to embarrass Trump's peace deal with Saudi Arabia and keep them from reforming from the Clintons and from Obama.
[00:13:39.809 --> 00:13:50.732]  Trump came out today and he said that he talked to the king and the king believes it was a rogue killer group, not his government, trying to set them up.
[00:13:51.633 --> 00:13:55.794]  Yeah, why would you do that in somebody else's country, on video, knowing what was going on?
[00:13:56.493 --> 00:13:57.734]  We're going to go to break here in a moment.

[00:15:45.395 --> 00:15:51.520]  They wanted to thank me for getting the InfoWars t-shirts on the Rangers game for millions of people at sea, so they just brought me a gift.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.641]  I don't even know what this is.
[00:15:52.661 --> 00:15:56.104]  Wait a second.
[00:15:56.144 --> 00:15:56.364]  No!
[00:15:57.645 --> 00:15:58.005]  No!
[00:15:58.445 --> 00:15:59.006]  I got it!
[00:16:00.635 --> 00:16:01.916]  It's a Trump Medusa shirt!
[00:16:01.936 --> 00:16:02.777]  Look at that, guys!
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.722]  I got the Trump Medusa shirt!
[00:16:08.442 --> 00:16:08.763]  What's that?
[00:16:08.783 --> 00:16:09.463]  There's more in there?
[00:16:09.944 --> 00:16:10.064]  Oh!
[00:16:11.685 --> 00:16:12.946]  It's a George Washington!
[00:16:13.287 --> 00:16:13.747]  Wow!
[00:16:14.928 --> 00:16:16.370]  I was not expecting this, really.
[00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.110]  Look at that one.
[00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.132]  That'll trigger somebody real good.
[00:16:20.033 --> 00:16:20.393]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16:22.015 --> 00:16:22.655]  Wow, wow.
[00:16:22.816 --> 00:16:25.058]  I'm like a kid on Christmas today.
[00:16:26.744 --> 00:16:28.884]  I want to thank the folks at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:29.225 --> 00:16:30.005]  This is amazing.
[00:16:30.085 --> 00:16:31.285]  I was not expecting this!
[00:16:38.546 --> 00:16:46.768]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:16:46.968 --> 00:16:48.208]  Believe me, I know.
[00:16:48.428 --> 00:16:52.749]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:56.230]  But thanks to super male vitality at InfoWarsTore.com,
[00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.191]  I still have that energy.
[00:16:58.411 --> 00:17:18.662]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[00:17:42.671 --> 00:17:46.114]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:17:46.454 --> 00:17:56.003]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:17:56.503 --> 00:17:59.928]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[00:18:00.268 --> 00:18:05.234]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:18:05.294 --> 00:18:07.657]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:18:07.917 --> 00:18:12.603]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:18:12.623 --> 00:18:13.184]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:18:13.584 --> 00:18:17.388]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:18:17.608 --> 00:18:20.270]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:18:20.551 --> 00:18:23.854]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.

[00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.772]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[00:19:41.989 --> 00:19:44.591]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:45.691]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:19:54.336 --> 00:19:55.597]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.161 --> 00:20:33.146]  Now I'm going to get into Elizabeth Warren and her supposed Native American heritage in the next segment, but the Boston Globe has put out a major retraction.
[00:20:34.306 --> 00:20:39.709]  It turns out that she's got the lowest level of Native American blood probably ever found in the United States.
[00:20:40.409 --> 00:20:49.533]  The average American who has any ancestry going back is about 1.6% Native American in DNA tests, but it turns out that she is a tiny
[00:20:50.715 --> 00:20:51.796]  Fraction of that.
[00:20:52.816 --> 00:20:56.718]  1 in 1 comma 024.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:05.883]  Due to a math error, the story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestral percentage of a potential 10th generation relative.
[00:21:06.344 --> 00:21:06.864]  It should be.
[00:21:06.944 --> 00:21:09.005]  So now it's got to be 10th generation.
[00:21:09.886 --> 00:21:13.268]  And now let's track back and see if her ancestors go back 10 generations.
[00:21:13.648 --> 00:21:14.468]  Then you know it's a lie.
[00:21:15.189 --> 00:21:16.089]  Now let me explain something.
[00:21:16.349 --> 00:21:18.270]  Things like Ancestry.com and 23andMe.
[00:21:21.078 --> 00:21:23.000]  See, I said I'd cover this next segment, but I'm already doing it.
[00:21:24.342 --> 00:21:28.046]  They just, for political correctness, I don't know why, add 6% African on there.
[00:21:28.467 --> 00:21:34.253]  Because they're saying the antecedent or the precursor or the fount of humanity is in Africa.
[00:21:35.315 --> 00:21:39.680]  More and more studies show that that's not really true, but that messes up their whole model.
[00:21:40.694 --> 00:21:47.638]  There are large groups of people in Asia and other places that have no connection to Africa being the supposed seat of humanity.
[00:21:48.178 --> 00:21:58.204]  It is true that a lot of the genetics that went into the Middle East and other areas are out of Africa, but what I'm getting at is these boilerplate type deals are very politically correct.
[00:21:59.932 --> 00:22:07.494]  Elizabeth Warren, ladies and gentlemen, you have to understand, anyone with Asian blood is also a match for Native American.
[00:22:07.934 --> 00:22:11.775]  You don't see the average Mexican walking around saying, I'm a Native tribes person.
[00:22:12.855 --> 00:22:13.135]  Okay?
[00:22:14.455 --> 00:22:24.918]  But again, they have large percentages of what you'd call Native American blood, which is exactly the same as Japanese or Chinese or Korean.
[00:22:25.896 --> 00:22:26.556]  It's the same blood.
[00:22:26.977 --> 00:22:38.244]  It's the same people that came across, they believe, the land bridge at times when all of the North Pole is completely frozen across, which it still does sometimes today.
[00:22:39.024 --> 00:22:42.947]  And it's, regardless DNA, it's... Let me just cover it now.
[00:22:42.967 --> 00:22:44.788]  I said I'd get to it next segment.
[00:22:44.808 --> 00:22:47.110]  I'll get into Trump bulldozing his enemies next segment.
[00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.931]  But this is just insane.
[00:22:50.732 --> 00:22:53.574]  Now she's demanding that drudge pay up.
[00:22:54.932 --> 00:22:55.693]  Stories on Drudge.
[00:22:57.014 --> 00:23:00.718]  Great-great-great-grandmother Warren tells Trump to pay up.
[00:23:00.758 --> 00:23:02.600]  Yes, Matt Drudge is not Native American either.
[00:23:02.901 --> 00:23:03.581]  He needs to pay up.
[00:23:03.962 --> 00:23:05.283]  Or Elizabeth Warren wants him to pay up.
[00:23:05.563 --> 00:23:06.645]  I'm teleprompter-free, folks.
[00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:10.269]  Great-great-great-grandmother Warren tells Trump to pay up.
[00:23:10.309 --> 00:23:11.129]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.681]  And then it links through the article right there.
[00:23:13.721 --> 00:23:27.211]  But I have the Boston Globe here, and I have the last minute of the five-minute little propaganda piece they put out, making fun of Trump, and then we've got President Trump responding to that.
[00:23:27.311 --> 00:23:38.199]  But now they're saying, if I do the math right here, that she has ten times less the Native American blood than she'd previously said in the report.
[00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:39.139]  And they've got this
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:50.202]  Leftist professor, DNA expert that says that she's looking at the DNA and that it's an eighth generation back.
[00:23:50.242 --> 00:23:53.703]  But now they're saying, oh, we're sorry, 10th generation back.
[00:23:54.943 --> 00:24:03.225]  So for all intents and purposes, ladies and gentlemen, President Trump is correct that this woman is not Native American.
[00:24:03.265 --> 00:24:05.105]  She could not be in one of the Native American tribes.
[00:24:05.666 --> 00:24:06.466]  You've got to be what, like 16%?
[00:24:09.156 --> 00:24:12.563]  And she's been caught in another galactic level fraud.
[00:24:13.264 --> 00:24:16.670]  But let's go ahead and see the last minute of Warren's little propaganda piece.
[00:24:17.782 --> 00:24:21.965]  I'm not enrolled in a tribe, and only tribes determine tribal citizenship.
[00:24:22.326 --> 00:24:27.470]  I understand and respect that distinction, but my family history is my family history.
[00:24:28.391 --> 00:24:29.351]  Pocahontas?
[00:24:29.692 --> 00:24:35.116]  This isn't just about casual racism, war hoops, and tomahawk chops.
[00:24:35.156 --> 00:24:39.920]  Native communities have faced discrimination, neglect, and violence for generations.
[00:24:40.621 --> 00:24:42.982]  And Trump can say whatever he wants about me.
[00:24:43.783 --> 00:24:48.525]  But mocking Native Americans or any group in order to try to get at me?
[00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:52.126]  That's not what America stands for.
[00:24:52.306 --> 00:24:55.387]  Some people have questioned my heritage and my family history.
[00:24:56.087 --> 00:24:57.448]  Maybe they do it to insult me.
[00:24:58.068 --> 00:25:05.411]  Maybe they do it to distract from the kinds of changes I'm fighting for and the kind of change I'm trying to bring to Washington.
[00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:08.432]  Maybe they do it because they think politics is a blood sport.
[00:25:09.991 --> 00:25:11.391]  But my parents were real people.
[00:25:12.031 --> 00:25:20.093]  The love they shared, the struggles they endured, the family they built, the story they lived, will always be etched on my heart.
[00:25:20.193 --> 00:25:29.815]  And no one, not even the President of the United States, will ever take it away from me.
[00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:33.816]  So this is a sick joke from geneticists because they know
[00:25:34.795 --> 00:25:41.919]  That most Europeans, you can go to Europe and go find a German family that has nothing but German ancestry going back thousands of years.
[00:25:42.299 --> 00:25:48.822]  You test their blood, they're going to have more Native American blood than Elizabeth Warren because Asiatic blood came into the area.
[00:25:49.502 --> 00:25:51.403]  The Muslims invaded who are part Asian.
[00:25:52.144 --> 00:25:57.126]  On average, Arabs are part African, part Anglo, and part Asian.
[00:25:57.266 --> 00:25:58.147]  That's what Arabs
[00:25:59.207 --> 00:26:03.089]  Basic genetic background is generally, and some people are whiter, some people are darker.
[00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:06.830]  You look at the Saudi royal family, some people look like they're black, because they are.
[00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.371]  They're like half African.
[00:26:08.931 --> 00:26:11.212]  Some look like they're as white as I am.
[00:26:12.232 --> 00:26:22.956]  That's how the genetics work, with the East and the South, the South being Africa, the East being Asia, meeting the Ice Age populations of Anglos, Caucasians.
[00:26:23.716 --> 00:26:27.158]  The Caucus Mountains is where the Caucasians basically start and end.
[00:26:28.214 --> 00:26:41.259]  So, you can go test anybody, and they're going to have little genetic pieces of this and that, unless they are a Sub-Saharan African, like the Pygmy tribe.
[00:26:41.559 --> 00:26:51.342]  They've tested Pygmy's blood, and it's 100% African, and it's even that tribe only, because they've been isolated for eons in that area.
[00:26:52.603 --> 00:26:56.144]  And because they've been isolated and inbreeding and things, they're also very short.
[00:26:56.943 --> 00:26:57.383]  Very little.
[00:26:58.184 --> 00:26:59.905]  And I've read books about that.
[00:26:59.945 --> 00:27:00.505]  Very, very interesting.
[00:27:00.525 --> 00:27:06.129]  But the whole point is, is that this is absolute pure bull.
[00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.451]  Total, complete hoax, as usual.
[00:27:09.951 --> 00:27:18.096]  And now they're saying, oh, sorry, we estimated that she was way more Native American, where she had one drop of Native American blood, basically.
[00:27:18.437 --> 00:27:22.719]  Now it's one-tenth of that, or one, one-twenty-four-thousandths.
[00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:23.480]  Is that how you say it?
[00:27:25.482 --> 00:27:29.865]  So here's, it should be, this is the Boston Globe, document cam shot please.
[00:27:32.647 --> 00:27:38.031]  It should be one, one, zero, two, four.
[00:27:38.271 --> 00:27:40.212]  One in one thousand twenty-fourths.
[00:27:41.213 --> 00:27:49.939]  My goodness, that's a, that'd be like saying, yeah, my dog's a pit bull, it's one, one, twenty-four thousandths, and you're like, your dog's a chihuahua.
[00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:51.500]  You're like, no, that's a pit bull.
[00:27:54.329 --> 00:28:01.535]  I mean, you've got Elizabeth Warren's cracker-ass leftist butt that is obsessed with being something other than white.
[00:28:01.835 --> 00:28:03.557]  She gets into major colleges.
[00:28:03.597 --> 00:28:07.640]  She gets all these scholarships saying that she's Pocahontas.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.541]  And the fact is, she's a fraud!
[00:28:09.922 --> 00:28:11.343]  And the fact is, she made it up!
[00:28:11.903 --> 00:28:17.288]  I mean, she dances around the fire at night and gets the peace pipe and smokes it!
[00:28:19.065 --> 00:28:22.149]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:22.729 --> 00:28:24.592]  Now, I would not call myself Native American.
[00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:28.216]  But my dad didn't go to one of these Native American things when he was a kid.
[00:28:28.236 --> 00:28:32.681]  Uh, where they would, you know, there'd be a tourist trap and say they were Native American.
[00:28:32.721 --> 00:28:35.545]  I mean, they went to the deals where everybody danced around for three days and...
[00:28:43.311 --> 00:28:43.911]  Did you hear?
[00:28:44.292 --> 00:28:45.732]  Christmas is coming in October.
[00:28:46.273 --> 00:28:47.753]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[00:28:48.294 --> 00:28:49.894]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[00:28:49.975 --> 00:28:52.756]  What's really coming in October is incredible deals.
[00:28:52.776 --> 00:28:56.738]  50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[00:28:57.478 --> 00:29:04.602]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[00:29:05.322 --> 00:29:10.045]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo Bird.
[00:29:11.206 --> 00:29:12.107]  By the way, the dinosaurs.
[00:29:12.367 --> 00:29:14.709]  Because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.613]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us.
[00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:25.677]  And you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[00:29:26.358 --> 00:29:31.122]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[00:29:31.202 --> 00:29:36.266]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[00:29:37.927 --> 00:29:51.298]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday, and of course for Cyber Monday, and for Christmas!
[00:29:51.858 --> 00:29:56.062]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[00:29:57.183 --> 00:30:02.547]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:03.868]  Black Friday's coming early.
[00:30:04.904 --> 00:30:06.125]  Cyber Monday's coming up.
[00:30:06.245 --> 00:30:12.211]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:18.196]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[00:30:19.017 --> 00:30:26.684]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[00:30:27.405 --> 00:30:29.547]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:30:30.743 --> 00:30:36.106]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world.
[00:30:36.287 --> 00:30:40.709]  After Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:45.773]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[00:30:46.353 --> 00:30:49.515]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[00:30:50.135 --> 00:30:55.098]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[00:30:55.138 --> 00:30:58.380]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[00:30:59.421 --> 00:31:00.582]  Get your X2.
[00:31:00.802 --> 00:31:03.603]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[00:31:03.984 --> 00:31:05.024]  Rainforest, selling out, 50% off.
[00:31:05.124 --> 00:31:07.646]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[00:31:08.346 --> 00:31:09.967]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[00:31:10.007 --> 00:31:12.368]  Now, I do that with air filtration, water filtration.
[00:31:12.729 --> 00:31:13.949]  They don't even have 50% markup.
[00:31:14.169 --> 00:31:14.650]  Take off.
[00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.170]  But they're discounted as well.
[00:31:16.411 --> 00:31:20.713]  And free shipping, store wide, mformorestore.com.
[00:31:20.913 --> 00:31:23.455]  So, this is the October
[00:31:24.975 --> 00:31:26.416]  Black Friday coming early.
[00:31:26.816 --> 00:31:27.977]  This is Christmas coming early.
[00:31:28.377 --> 00:31:29.898]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[00:31:30.058 --> 00:31:32.099]  This is Christmas in October.
[00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:35.760]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[00:31:35.841 --> 00:31:36.681]  The five-star ratings.
[00:31:36.701 --> 00:31:38.682]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts.
[00:31:39.382 --> 00:31:40.223]  So that you have them.
[00:31:40.383 --> 00:31:41.663]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:42.884]  Christmas is only two months away.
[00:31:43.664 --> 00:31:46.286]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products and win-win.
[00:31:46.546 --> 00:31:47.346]  I'm counting on you.
[00:31:47.386 --> 00:31:48.326]  You've always come through.
[00:31:48.346 --> 00:31:49.927]  They know you always come through.
[00:31:50.227 --> 00:31:53.229]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[00:31:53.889 --> 00:31:58.613]  With a five-star rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[00:31:59.634 --> 00:32:00.835]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[00:32:01.435 --> 00:32:02.296]  Nobody's got that.
[00:32:03.056 --> 00:32:03.897]  Credit card processing.
[00:32:04.337 --> 00:32:06.359]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[00:32:06.639 --> 00:32:07.239]  We expose them.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:11.343]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.
[00:32:13.089 --> 00:32:18.432]  We're in some serious times because we've been effective, we've been strong, we've been forceful, we've been successful.
[00:32:18.492 --> 00:32:20.272]  You've been successful by supporting us.
[00:32:20.312 --> 00:32:28.156]  So, InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareLife.com, today, in this mega sale, 50% off free shipping, to help bring the InfoWare to the next level.
[00:32:28.396 --> 00:32:29.277]  I'm counting on you.
[00:32:29.537 --> 00:32:30.457]  You always come through.
[00:32:30.798 --> 00:32:31.538]  Take advantage of this.
[00:32:31.578 --> 00:32:33.719]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[00:32:42.024 --> 00:32:44.658]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.623 --> 00:33:25.405]  I'm a little bit late getting into the studio, and I apologize.
[00:33:25.485 --> 00:33:29.007]  We're just laughing our butts off at Elizabeth Warren.
[00:33:29.587 --> 00:33:34.150]  If you just joined us, can we put her tweet back up on screen, please, for viewers?
[00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:43.776]  She has now challenged President Trump to pay up the $1 million that he promised if she could prove that she was an Indian.
[00:33:44.676 --> 00:33:48.318]  Well, Trump knows full well you've got to be 16% for the tribes to accept you.
[00:33:48.338 --> 00:33:50.139]  Some tribes will do it for something like 13%.
[00:33:53.154 --> 00:33:55.616]  And so she came out and she said, I am ready.
[00:33:55.877 --> 00:33:57.118]  I am a Native American.
[00:33:57.698 --> 00:33:58.699]  It has been proven.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.025]  And so they had this liberal genetics professor say that they looked at her DNA.
[00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:12.029]  And that eight generations ago, she may have had a grandparent that had some Native American.
[00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:13.290]  There it is.
[00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:21.734]  By the way, at Real Donald Trump, remember saying on 7-5 that you'd give a million to charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry?
[00:34:22.395 --> 00:34:22.935]  I remember!
[00:34:23.575 --> 00:34:24.436]  And here's the verdict.
[00:34:24.596 --> 00:34:29.238]  Please send the check to the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center.
[00:34:29.939 --> 00:34:31.600]  NIWRC.org.
[00:34:32.967 --> 00:34:35.048]  Warren reveals test confirming ancestry.
[00:34:35.488 --> 00:34:37.488]  Well, that was the Boston Globe this morning.
[00:34:38.568 --> 00:34:41.049]  A few hours later, they had to retract.
[00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:58.473]  And it goes on to say, ladies and gentlemen, that it's 10 generations ago, and due to a math error, a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential 10th generation relative.
[00:34:58.853 --> 00:34:59.553]  It should be 1 in 1,000
[00:35:03.581 --> 00:35:04.141]  Twenty-fourths.
[00:35:05.101 --> 00:35:10.803]  So it's less than a drop of blood out of the 192 ounces that are in the human body.
[00:35:11.523 --> 00:35:13.403]  And we've done the math here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:13.443 --> 00:35:18.704]  A world-exclusive 192 ounces of blood in the average body.
[00:35:19.184 --> 00:35:25.286]  Warren's blood, according to what the Boston Globe is now saying with geneticists, has changed their story.
[00:35:25.306 --> 00:35:25.286]  0.1875.
[00:35:25.326 --> 00:35:26.406]  Less than half a drop.
[00:35:33.815 --> 00:35:35.096]  Oh man, that's funny!
[00:35:35.457 --> 00:35:36.498]  And it gets even more funny.
[00:35:37.318 --> 00:35:46.046]  There aren't any Europeans in all of the Hun invasions and Islamic invasions that are called mongrels.
[00:35:46.266 --> 00:35:49.769]  That's what they call themselves, but it means half white, half Asian.
[00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:52.672]  That's where you get the term, that person's a mongrel.
[00:35:53.812 --> 00:35:56.255]  It's become an insult, a pejorative, it's not.
[00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:59.599]  You know, the Huns, and all the rest of them were Mongols.
[00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:08.047]  And they invaded the Chinese, and they invaded, they tried to invade Japan, and they invaded the Middle East, and they invaded Rome, and they invaded Eastern Europe and Western Europe.
[00:36:08.087 --> 00:36:10.470]  They invaded and invaded, and they raped.
[00:36:11.751 --> 00:36:16.976]  And also, there were people that came there as tradesmen, and there was the spice trade going back thousands of years.
[00:36:17.317 --> 00:36:19.239]  So there aren't any Europeans
[00:36:20.612 --> 00:36:26.255]  That don't have a fraction of Native American blood because Asian is the same as Native American.
[00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:27.095]  It's Asian.
[00:36:29.056 --> 00:36:31.697]  But it has this mystique to be part Native American.
[00:36:32.518 --> 00:36:34.959]  Because then you get to be a victim and feel sorry for yourself.
[00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.992]  Even though I had ancestors, there wasn't just one trail of tears.
[00:36:43.272 --> 00:36:53.980]  There were a bunch with Midwestern Native Americans being taken out of Texas, out of Oklahoma, out of the Dakotas and shipped to military camps and shipped to Florida.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:37:05.268]  And my dad's like, yeah, you know, and then my grandmother, you know, she came back from the camps out in Florida when she was a little girl, when she was a young woman.
[00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:07.029]  And then I'm like, oh, really?
[00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:08.670]  Let's go look at the ancestry here, Dad.
[00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:10.412]  And then there it is.
[00:37:11.192 --> 00:37:16.676]  But it's still a tiny amount because his grandmother was half Native American.
[00:37:17.337 --> 00:37:18.458]  So that made his father 25%.
[00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:20.980]  So that made him 13%.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.124]  So that makes me, and I'm gonna go ahead and get my DNA done.
[00:37:26.204 --> 00:37:29.226]  I did it once, but I misunderstood at the medical office.
[00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:34.350]  It was a DNA test about what I absorb and what I don't absorb and a really complex, big, long report.
[00:37:35.512 --> 00:37:40.837]  So I just said, okay, you're taking my blood, doing my liver work, you know, a few years ago, you know, checking all my other stuff, my heart and all that.
[00:37:41.117 --> 00:37:43.919]  Go ahead, you know, do the thousand dollar complex test.
[00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:44.960]  I thought, boy, that's expensive.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.621]  Always send it to a special lab.
[00:37:46.641 --> 00:37:50.204]  Then I get the report and it's all about what I absorb, what I don't absorb.
[00:37:50.945 --> 00:37:54.628]  The doctor thought with my Northern European genetics that I would have trouble absorbing vitamin B12.
[00:37:54.949 --> 00:37:55.669]  It was true.
[00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.591]  It was all this crazy stuff.
[00:37:57.631 --> 00:37:59.493]  My DNA, my RNA.
[00:37:59.633 --> 00:38:00.854]  Well, RNA is a virus.
[00:38:00.894 --> 00:38:04.297]  My mitochondrial activity is at 100%.
[00:38:04.337 --> 00:38:04.998]  That's very rare.
[00:38:05.298 --> 00:38:07.160]  Very high level energy there in the cells.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.021]  But they predicted that as well.
[00:38:09.322 --> 00:38:11.524]  But it was all there in the testing.
[00:38:13.225 --> 00:38:16.128]  So, I'm going to take the quickest, most respected test.
[00:38:17.563 --> 00:38:19.905]  And again, that's kind of a misnomer.
[00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:22.867]  The quicker the test, the least clear they are.
[00:38:23.207 --> 00:38:26.390]  But I'm going to get a good test that's the quickest at the same time.
[00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:29.092]  I'm going to find kind of a happy medium between those.
[00:38:29.112 --> 00:38:33.836]  And I'm going to do a test to see how much more Pocahontas than I am than Pocahontas.
[00:38:33.856 --> 00:38:35.777]  Because, I mean, I know I'm part Pocahontas.
[00:38:35.837 --> 00:38:37.138]  I mean, I know that for a fact.
[00:38:37.558 --> 00:38:43.003]  But it's just crazy to see the levels that she's gone through to do this.
[00:38:43.283 --> 00:38:45.665]  But it also illustrates how these people operate.
[00:38:45.705 --> 00:38:47.026]  I mean, they could get a bunch of women.
[00:38:48.168 --> 00:38:53.352]  They go falsely accused Kavanaugh and all the witnesses said that there was no evidence and none of it ever happened.
[00:38:54.954 --> 00:39:01.539]  What are they going to do now to try to give Trump a black eye and make him look stupid, make him look bad?
[00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:03.000]  They'll do anything.
[00:39:04.161 --> 00:39:05.142]  Here's the big takeaway.
[00:39:05.442 --> 00:39:06.283]  We've done the math.
[00:39:07.844 --> 00:39:10.826]  It's all admitted that Pocahontas
[00:39:11.963 --> 00:39:12.083]  Yes.
[00:39:31.328 --> 00:39:34.410]  Point zero zero one Native American heritage.
[00:39:34.991 --> 00:39:39.694]  Average American European has double the Native American genome as Warner, according to New York Times.
[00:39:39.974 --> 00:39:42.776]  So she is a thoroughbred white person.
[00:39:44.537 --> 00:39:45.938]  She is the opposite.
[00:39:47.179 --> 00:39:48.460]  This is Pocahontas.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:49.721]  This is not.
[00:39:51.121 --> 00:39:52.502]  This, this is not.
[00:39:53.163 --> 00:39:54.884]  This is what Pocahontas looks like.
[00:39:56.105 --> 00:39:57.306]  Very, very pretty, by the way.
[00:39:57.866 --> 00:39:59.507]  You know, Savannah looks like Pocahontas.
[00:39:59.567 --> 00:40:00.168]  I never thought of that.
[00:40:01.697 --> 00:40:03.018]  One of the great folks that works here at the office.
[00:40:03.399 --> 00:40:05.101]  But she does not look like Elizabeth Warren.
[00:40:05.982 --> 00:40:07.283]  Also known as Cracker Butt.
[00:40:08.705 --> 00:40:16.294]  Because there's nothing weirder than a leftist virtue signaling that they are a minority when they aren't.
[00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.216]  So, let's continue here.
[00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:22.892]  Wow, this is a big article on Infowars.com.
[00:40:22.912 --> 00:40:26.613]  I'm glad that the crew is working on this as fast as I am, or faster.
[00:40:27.034 --> 00:40:31.295]  Samples from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia to stand in for Native American.
[00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:44.661]  Hollywood actor James Woods noted an important paragraph in the Boston Globe story which said the professor who conducted the test used samples from Mexico, Peru, Colombia to stand in for Native American.
[00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:47.502]  Ooh, because you see, it is all the same thing.
[00:40:48.649 --> 00:41:03.261]  The actual facts are that a non-commercial tester, Carlos Bustamante, deduced that Warren was between 132 to 1512 Colombian, Peruvian, or Mexican.
[00:41:05.203 --> 00:41:13.150]  The death of Native American DNA prompted the examiner to use those national markers based on migration theory.
[00:41:14.778 --> 00:41:19.280]  So, this actually holds up what I'm saying, because that's where everybody came from.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.201]  It's not a theory, it's a fact!
[00:41:23.942 --> 00:41:33.947]  That they've dug up dead Eskimos in Alaska, and they've tested them right next to Chinese blood, and they're most related to ancient Chinese.
[00:41:35.407 --> 00:41:37.388]  Which are really a different group than the Chinese today.
[00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.731]  Because civilization makes you get weak.
[00:41:44.157 --> 00:41:46.058]  But that's a whole other side issue.
[00:41:46.258 --> 00:41:46.899]  I'm going to stop now.
[00:41:46.919 --> 00:41:48.119]  I've already spent too much time on this.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.060]  It's very interesting.
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.521]  Elizabeth Warren is a complete liar.
[00:41:51.561 --> 00:41:53.042]  We're going to come back and get right into Trump.
[00:41:53.142 --> 00:41:54.462]  Bulldozing him on 60 Minutes.
[00:41:54.783 --> 00:41:55.663]  How they're panicking.
[00:41:55.783 --> 00:41:57.624]  What really happened in Saudi Arabia.
[00:41:57.664 --> 00:41:58.985]  Why is it the biggest story in the world.
[00:41:59.445 --> 00:42:00.525]  Watch the news behind the news.
[00:42:00.545 --> 00:42:01.106]  Steve Pachinik.
[00:42:02.014 --> 00:42:05.716]  Formerly in psychological operations at the Pentagon, the CIA, and the State Department.
[00:42:05.976 --> 00:42:06.456]  High level.
[00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:08.017]  He's run regime change.
[00:42:08.057 --> 00:42:09.557]  He's run Camp David Accords.
[00:42:09.577 --> 00:42:10.998]  He's helped found Delta Force.
[00:42:11.398 --> 00:42:12.659]  He's a smart cookie.
[00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:15.200]  I don't know his view on this yet, but we'll get his take.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:20.182]  I think everything points towards a false flag that he stabilized the peace deal Trump's trying to form.
[00:42:21.042 --> 00:42:26.811]  With the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the reforms we've seen and that it's a blatant deep state operation.
[00:42:26.831 --> 00:42:28.954]  But we'll get his take on that and more.
[00:42:29.415 --> 00:42:29.896]  Stay with us.
[00:42:29.976 --> 00:42:32.099]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.682]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:44.758]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[00:42:44.818 --> 00:42:45.898]  They know how the world really works.
[00:42:46.719 --> 00:42:49.221]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:50.542]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[00:42:51.102 --> 00:42:57.947]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[00:42:59.128 --> 00:43:06.474]  But Infowars, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[00:43:07.432 --> 00:43:12.156]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[00:43:12.436 --> 00:43:16.279]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[00:43:16.919 --> 00:43:25.986]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, so I know their larger game plan.
[00:43:26.106 --> 00:43:28.568]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[00:43:28.988 --> 00:43:31.250]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[00:43:31.871 --> 00:43:33.012]  Now you've seen massive
[00:43:33.732 --> 00:43:41.677]  Corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[00:43:42.398 --> 00:43:47.181]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[00:43:47.241 --> 00:43:51.243]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[00:43:53.985 --> 00:44:07.309]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[00:44:07.909 --> 00:44:12.111]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[00:44:13.231 --> 00:44:18.713]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[00:44:18.993 --> 00:44:20.073]  Black Friday's coming early.
[00:44:20.968 --> 00:44:22.148]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[00:44:22.288 --> 00:44:26.610]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:32.592]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[00:44:33.392 --> 00:44:40.914]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[00:44:41.814 --> 00:44:43.935]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:44:45.146 --> 00:44:55.110]  InfoWars has always been in our hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[00:44:55.550 --> 00:45:00.252]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[00:45:00.752 --> 00:45:03.913]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[00:45:04.553 --> 00:45:09.515]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[00:45:09.555 --> 00:45:12.797]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[00:45:13.817 --> 00:45:15.299]  Get your X2.
[00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:18.002]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[00:45:18.362 --> 00:45:20.244]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[00:45:20.604 --> 00:45:22.046]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[00:45:22.767 --> 00:45:24.408]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[00:45:24.448 --> 00:45:26.791]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[00:45:27.131 --> 00:45:30.595]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[00:45:30.815 --> 00:45:30.955]  And,

[00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:58.354]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability

[00:46:29.158 --> 00:46:30.079]  You always come through.
[00:46:30.399 --> 00:46:31.160]  Take advantage of this.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.343]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[00:46:41.481 --> 00:46:44.077]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:23.863 --> 00:47:25.505]  My head is spinning, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:25.925 --> 00:47:42.721]  The Boston Globe, less than six hours after publishing there, Elizabeth Warren piece saying that she is part Native American, confirming her ancestry, has retracted it and said that she has amongst the lowest level of non-white blood of anyone in the United States.
[00:47:43.542 --> 00:47:57.534]  In fact, she's so pure-blooded that they're actually now reporting in a lot of major ancestry sites and other places that whoever put out these results is being deceptive and didn't know what they were doing.
[00:47:58.495 --> 00:48:04.920]  In fact, it's also been pointed out that anybody can spit in a petri dish or in one of these collection boxes and mail it in.
[00:48:05.881 --> 00:48:09.804]  I mean, I could get somebody who's Native American to do it and show them, you know, 100% Native American.
[00:48:11.869 --> 00:48:15.173]  But instead, the numbers are simply incredible.
[00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:26.264]  So we've got chain of custody here, but then we've got the fact that they're saying she's part Native American when the test results itself show that it's 1 out of 1,000.024, and that this lady is more white than Hitler!
[00:48:35.123 --> 00:48:37.964]  I mean, this woman is more white than Dolph Lundgren!
[00:48:38.524 --> 00:48:39.564]  Arnold Schwarzenegger!
[00:48:40.324 --> 00:48:43.165]  She's more white than somebody from Iceland, from Reykjavik!
[00:48:46.786 --> 00:48:49.647]  By the way, I'm gonna get my DNA test done.
[00:48:49.667 --> 00:48:50.567]  I mean, again, I had it done.
[00:48:50.587 --> 00:48:52.327]  I thought it was for my background.
[00:48:52.647 --> 00:48:53.447]  Shows how busy I am.
[00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:54.868]  They're like, hey, you want a DNA test?
[00:48:54.908 --> 00:48:55.488]  Yeah, sure!
[00:48:56.834 --> 00:48:57.834]  Yeah, we're doing it with blood.
[00:48:57.874 --> 00:48:59.215]  These are the really sophisticated ones.
[00:48:59.255 --> 00:49:05.097]  And then it turns out it's just total genetic typing, which is useful information, a 45-page report I have.
[00:49:06.358 --> 00:49:08.779]  But still, it's just crazy.
[00:49:08.799 --> 00:49:12.440]  So I'm going to get the regular one done, because I can't wait to publish that.
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:13.721]  Because we did the math.
[00:49:13.741 --> 00:49:19.783]  If you just joined us, there's 192 ounces of blood in the average person's body.
[00:49:21.516 --> 00:49:30.181]  And we published the results on Infowars.com that she has less than half a drop if you equated it to just the amount of blood in her body.
[00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:31.641]  So, there you go.
[00:49:32.822 --> 00:49:36.564]  She could pass a German racial purity test that almost no one could pass.
[00:49:36.984 --> 00:49:38.465]  She could have been the head of the SS.
[00:49:38.825 --> 00:49:40.246]  She could have been Heinrich Himmler.
[00:49:41.466 --> 00:49:44.028]  Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Wohlen!
[00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:49.914]  Only the most superior, pure blood can be in charge of the operations.
[00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:53.377]  Did you notice she looks surprisingly like a Hitler?
[00:49:54.161 --> 00:49:57.143]  The truth is, she is the granddaughter of the Führer.
[00:49:58.403 --> 00:49:59.344]  As is Merkel.
[00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:16.694]  They are working together to return the Reich to its proper place in global domination through the plan of the Führer, the European Union, a project hatched by his superior intellect that will soon be revisited upon America!
[00:50:18.271 --> 00:50:25.954]  Now I'm being sarcastic, this is called satire, but this scenario has a better chance of her actually being related to Pocahontas.
[00:50:28.735 --> 00:50:30.135]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:50:30.215 --> 00:50:33.156]  Okay, I am blowing the whole show here on this, but it is fun.
[00:50:35.437 --> 00:50:35.917]  I'm sorry.
[00:50:37.078 --> 00:50:38.618]  The article's on Infowars.com.
[00:50:39.098 --> 00:50:39.939]  Jamie White did it.
[00:50:42.299 --> 00:50:46.481]  We should really add the point here that
[00:50:48.422 --> 00:50:50.564]  Evidence is mounting that this whole thing is a fraud.
[00:50:50.584 --> 00:50:56.830]  Because they put out one number, and it turns out she's got ten times less than that incredibly tiny number.
[00:50:56.850 --> 00:51:02.636]  And this is what it boils down to.
[00:51:02.696 --> 00:51:04.537]  My buddy sent me a text right as I was thinking it.
[00:51:04.918 --> 00:51:07.160]  Liz Warren's DNA test likely a hoax.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:09.842]  No controlled custody of a saliva test.
[00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:12.385]  Anybody can spit in a tube and mail it off.
[00:51:13.709 --> 00:51:14.990]  Absurdly easy to fake.
[00:51:15.531 --> 00:51:18.013]  Oh, but the Democrats, they wouldn't fake anything.
[00:51:18.653 --> 00:51:21.336]  They're just the biggest pack of liars the planet's ever seen.
[00:51:21.616 --> 00:51:22.637]  Okay, I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:51:25.919 --> 00:51:31.024]  I have Trump destroying them on 60 Minutes, a bunch of clips I want to get to, where he says China's the main threat.
[00:51:32.545 --> 00:51:38.250]  I've got incredible news out of Europe, and really good news I want to get to.
[00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:44.252]  I've got the latest on what's really happening in Saudi Arabia.
[00:51:45.773 --> 00:51:49.015]  How the Secret Service foiled an assassination plot against Trump by ISIS.
[00:51:49.055 --> 00:51:49.835]  I want to get into that.
[00:51:51.997 --> 00:51:54.738]  ISIS has ordered more truck attack and more stabbing attacks in the last month.
[00:51:54.758 --> 00:51:55.819]  That's why you're seeing so many.
[00:51:55.859 --> 00:51:57.580]  And the media then covers up who's doing it.
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:06.045]  Even when they take credit, they're also planning more mass shooting attacks like they did in Vegas.
[00:52:07.205 --> 00:52:08.126]  But that got covered up.
[00:52:08.226 --> 00:52:09.467]  They tried to blame it on the American people.
[00:52:10.626 --> 00:52:13.487]  You also have Alec Baldwin saying we need to overthrow the government.
[00:52:15.148 --> 00:52:16.168]  That's out of the union leader.
[00:52:16.288 --> 00:52:28.153]  So this is the hype and this is the lawlessness and this is the level of danger that we're dealing with here as they try to bring this country into a civil emergency.
[00:52:29.874 --> 00:52:38.738]  And then when their minions go out and shoot and kill and stab people and block traffic and bomb people, they have the mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler,
[00:52:40.441 --> 00:53:00.094]  Comes out and stands by decision to quote, allow Antifa to block traffic, burn American flags, and then on top of it, attack the fourth prayer rally they just had this weekend.
[00:53:03.376 --> 00:53:08.239]  So, that's the level
[00:53:12.976 --> 00:53:25.099]  Of rioting and unlawfulness that we see coming out of these individuals.
[00:53:26.779 --> 00:53:36.802]  But the good news is humanity is waking up to all of it very, very, very, very quickly.
[00:53:38.382 --> 00:53:41.303]  So that's just some of what we're going to be covering in the next hour.
[00:53:41.363 --> 00:53:48.645]  We have Dr. Steve Pachenik joining us, who always has a lot of really, really thought-provoking inside intel.
[00:53:48.665 --> 00:53:50.605]  Because I'm like you.
[00:53:50.645 --> 00:53:52.606]  I'm like, who cares what happens in Saudi Arabia or Turkey?
[00:53:53.206 --> 00:53:57.807]  Well, all this movement deals with a plan to destabilize the Middle East and derail
[00:53:59.605 --> 00:54:08.110]  President Trump's attempts to reform the Middle East and end the strategy of tension, end the strategy of conflict, and actually bring real peace to the area.
[00:54:09.912 --> 00:54:16.736]  And the way this was all done points towards a false flag, in my view, to set up the Saudi royal family and keep them from reforming.
[00:54:16.756 --> 00:54:18.297]  But we'll get Steve Pucinich's take on that.
[00:54:18.717 --> 00:54:24.261]  I said yesterday and on Friday that I thought evidence pointed towards it being a false flag.
[00:54:24.741 --> 00:54:28.544]  Now the President says he talked to the King this morning and he said that
[00:54:31.263 --> 00:54:45.989]  He absolutely does not take responsibility and that they believe that rogue groups, rogue killers were involved and not the government.
[00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:52.172]  So we will get to all of that when we start the next hour and a ton of other clips I've not gotten to yet.
[00:54:52.252 --> 00:54:52.812]  Please remember,
[00:54:54.113 --> 00:55:00.877]  The globalists are doing everything they can to shut this broadcast down, to kick us off the internet, to demonize us, to sue us, to lie about us.
[00:55:00.937 --> 00:55:09.742]  But because you've stood with us, we're still here and reaching a lot of new people on TV and radio, and the broadcast has expanded there.
[00:55:09.802 --> 00:55:12.483]  So they censor us one place, it only spreads to another.
[00:55:12.523 --> 00:55:13.964]  So thank you all for what you're doing.
[00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:15.365]  Thank you to our affiliates.
[00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:16.846]  Thank you to all the listeners.
[00:55:17.166 --> 00:55:18.127]  Thank you to all the viewers.
[00:55:18.147 --> 00:55:20.428]  Without you, none of this is possible.
[00:55:20.448 --> 00:55:22.149]  So I salute you, and I thank you.
[00:55:24.864 --> 00:55:28.948]  We are running a special right now that is the biggest special in our history.
[00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:32.171]  Because you've seen them brag.
[00:55:32.211 --> 00:55:47.545]  They took PayPal, and they took four other payment processors, they go look at who we're using, then they call them, they harass them, they threaten them, they lie about us, and they claim that we're harassing people online, so that's why George Soros' Democrat groups then say, I must be taken off the internet.
[00:55:48.902 --> 00:55:54.384]  Well, as soon as they get sued here very soon, we'll get all the discovery and we'll be able to prove who's doing the real harassing here.
[00:55:54.464 --> 00:55:55.805]  So, get ready for that.
[00:55:56.365 --> 00:56:00.027]  It's time for the Southern Poverty Law Center and all these folks to get in some serious trouble.
[00:56:00.507 --> 00:56:07.090]  A half billion dollars offshore in illegal accounts, total mafia organization, M4 Wars is going on the offense big time.
[00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:11.972]  So get ready, all of you, Van Jones, Morris Dees, all of you.
[00:56:12.572 --> 00:56:14.573]  I'm going to Congress, I'm going to turn the heat up.
[00:56:14.973 --> 00:56:15.874]  You're going to get in big trouble.
[00:56:16.889 --> 00:56:23.395]  But continuing, we have 50% off All-Info Wars Life Super Sale with free shipping store-wide.

[00:57:06.633 --> 00:57:09.493]  Trump's great, but he can't dut him in control one-tenth of the government.
[00:57:09.814 --> 00:57:10.734]  You need to be prepared.

[00:57:29.991 --> 00:57:31.294]  Are we happy and effective?
[00:57:32.638 --> 00:57:36.328]  Consultation with leading experts in the field makes it perfectly clear.
[00:57:40.948 --> 00:57:43.931]  That we are all now programmed for perfect happiness.
[00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:45.312]  Perfect happiness.

[00:57:47.534 --> 00:57:48.434]  Perfect happiness.
[00:57:48.935 --> 00:57:49.535]  What's wrong?
[00:57:49.635 --> 00:57:50.576]  Nothing, nothing really.
[00:57:51.237 --> 00:57:52.978]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[00:57:53.238 --> 00:57:56.581]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[00:57:56.922 --> 00:57:57.382]  Yes, thank you.
[00:57:57.442 --> 00:57:58.203]  I'll be alright.
[00:57:58.323 --> 00:58:01.646]  Call 3485... We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
[00:58:03.907 --> 00:58:08.130]  Birth-borns are not allowed more than five units of Interval.
[00:58:08.191 --> 00:58:14.995]  Remember, substitution of Interval for Etrocine may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
[00:58:15.596 --> 00:58:16.156]  Thank you.
[00:58:16.937 --> 00:58:17.818]  Work hard.
[00:58:18.198 --> 00:58:18.918]  What's wrong?
[00:58:19.519 --> 00:58:20.980]  Increase production.
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:22.661]  What's wrong?
[00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:24.222]  Prevent accidents.
[00:58:24.923 --> 00:58:26.364]  What's wrong?
[00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:29.586]  And be happy.
[00:58:30.467 --> 00:58:31.347]  What's wrong?
[00:58:32.862 --> 00:58:39.245]  If you feel you are not properly sedated, call 348-844 immediately.
[00:58:39.665 --> 00:58:45.488]  Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.

[00:59:31.877 --> 00:59:35.779]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.861 --> 01:00:06.688]  Alright, coming up, I'm going to be judicious, I'm going to be focused, I'm going to be fast moving.
[01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:09.552]  I've got 20 clips or more I want to get to.
[01:00:10.945 --> 01:00:15.006]  NBC's had to retract, admit that Trump did not demonize Robert E. Lee.
[01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:15.626]  He praised him.
[01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:17.147]  That's a big retraction.
[01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:21.128]  They've had to retract that Warren even has any Native American blood.
[01:00:21.168 --> 01:00:22.809]  I mean, she has the lowest amount ever discovered.
[01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:27.790]  I mean, it's like everyone has some, reportedly, and none can be found.
[01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:29.951]  And we're going to get into him bulldozing.
[01:00:29.971 --> 01:00:31.291]  60 Minutes, that's coming up.
[01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:33.832]  But first, Freedom of the Press is on Death Watch.
[01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:38.865]  Freedom of the press is taking a beating worldwide in 2018.
[01:00:39.085 --> 01:00:50.512]  While American independent media is under a full-on attack, the likes of which has never been seen before in American history, the vague moniker of fake news is being used to imprison and even murder journalists.
[01:00:50.572 --> 01:00:54.955]  Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
[01:00:55.455 --> 01:00:59.878]  He's a 33-year-old crown prince that they are pushing to the limit.
[01:01:00.278 --> 01:01:01.179]  He's cleaning
[01:01:02.543 --> 01:01:14.038]  up that country because that country is despicable that country has had some major problems and he's made it clear that he's going to clean it up so what better thing to do than just throw a wrench into the works
[01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.258]  It's sabotage.
[01:01:16.478 --> 01:01:17.339]  It's a problem.
[01:01:17.919 --> 01:01:20.340]  It has a lot to do with the midterm elections.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:22.780]  We're not happy about it.
[01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:24.341]  We're really not happy about it.
[01:01:24.401 --> 01:01:33.823]  What could be said about Jamal Ahmed Shoghi that hasn't already been said about Seth Rich?
[01:01:34.163 --> 01:01:35.684]  It's a big problem.
[01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:39.406]  The story he was working on proves the motivation.
[01:01:39.846 --> 01:01:42.867]  These are the type of stories that gets InfoWars de-platformed.
[01:01:43.027 --> 01:01:58.675]  In Myanmar, while investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims, two Reuters journalists, Wah Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, were imprisoned for seven years under an ancient law known as the Official Secrets Act, now revamped under the guise of fake news.
[01:01:59.015 --> 01:02:05.038]  Under Section 505B of the Myanmar Penal Code, a colonial-era law banning publication of
[01:02:05.418 --> 01:02:08.140]  So you do agree that there were more Republicans than Democrats?
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.221]  I didn't say that, but I do.
[01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:10.602]  Well, you can't have it both ways, sir.
[01:02:10.622 --> 01:02:15.485]  It's either 50-50 or one side is disproportionately affected, and the allegation is that more Republicans were affected.
[01:02:33.058 --> 01:02:37.941]  Well, we don't always have the best methods to determine who is a Republican and who is a Democrat.
[01:02:38.681 --> 01:02:46.025]  Do you discriminate more on philosophy, like anti-conservative versus pro-liberal?
[01:02:46.745 --> 01:02:46.925]  No.
[01:02:47.786 --> 01:02:53.789]  Our policies and our algorithms don't take into consideration any affiliation, philosophy, or viewpoint.
[01:02:54.489 --> 01:02:55.650]  That's hard to stomach.
[01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:56.130]  I'm not...
[01:02:59.069 --> 01:03:12.538]  We wouldn't be having this discussion if there wasn't a general agreement that your company has discriminated against conservatives, most of whom happen to be Republican.
[01:03:14.241 --> 01:03:19.765]  I believe that we have found impartial outcomes, and those are what we intend to fix and continue to measure.
[01:03:20.145 --> 01:03:28.271]  Back in America, social media overlords Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg went all in on silencing independent media.
[01:03:28.491 --> 01:03:30.652]  In a purge of over 800 pages and over 251 accounts,
[01:03:33.274 --> 01:03:47.244]  Sweeping up independent media pages with millions of followers that were holding political corruption, police brutality, Second Amendment rights, and a host of other topics accountable that had been ignored or sanitized by corporate media.
[01:03:47.544 --> 01:04:02.155]  Sites affected by the purge, like the Free Thought Project, Anti-Media, and Press for Truth, offer fact-based sourced content that threatens the corrupt Democratic Party, attempting to silence our founding principles in order to win in November.
[01:04:02.435 --> 01:04:14.021]  If this is an election meddling by the liberal-based Twitter and Facebook Goliaths and racketeering by the corporate media that benefits from destroying its competition, then what is?
[01:04:14.542 --> 01:04:21.486]  If Congress continues to sit on its hands, then the First Amendment is essentially null and void in the United States.
[01:04:21.846 --> 01:04:29.810]  As an American, your vote this November could steer the United States into a wounded republic or a draconian leftist nightmare.
[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:31.231]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:04:39.737 --> 01:04:47.979]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:04:48.159 --> 01:04:49.400]  Believe me, I know.
[01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:53.921]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:04:53.941 --> 01:04:57.442]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com.
[01:04:57.922 --> 01:04:59.402]  I still have that energy.
[01:04:59.622 --> 01:05:19.847]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:05:20.367 --> 01:05:24.131]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[01:05:24.372 --> 01:05:27.796]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[01:05:28.076 --> 01:05:32.601]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:05:33.102 --> 01:05:35.124]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:05:35.825 --> 01:05:38.307]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:05:59.722 --> 01:06:04.986]  We now take you live to the defense of Western civilization and the routing of the globalists.
[01:06:05.987 --> 01:06:08.669]  But the fighting is heavy and intense.
[01:06:08.689 --> 01:06:14.774]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:17.576]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:06:19.237 --> 01:06:27.424]  All right, we've got the founder of the Patriot Prayer March, Mr. Gibson, who had his fourth march in
[01:06:29.541 --> 01:06:30.396]  Portland, Oregon.
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:41.144]  Yesterday, and the police and the mayor and others absolutely let the vicious Antifa attack, but the Antifa still got their asses handed to them.
[01:06:41.604 --> 01:06:44.265]  So the media spun it, the patriots were doing something bad.
[01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:47.647]  We have the real video and the real eyewitnesses coming up.
[01:06:47.767 --> 01:06:49.407]  Antifa was burning American flags.
[01:06:50.348 --> 01:06:51.428]  They were attacking people.
[01:06:51.828 --> 01:07:00.212]  Ted Wheeler, the Portland mayor, defends the decision to allow Antifa to block traffic and beat elderly people's cars with clubs screaming, F you white people.
[01:07:01.658 --> 01:07:03.900]  It is all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:10.587]  Then Dr. Steve Pchenik joins us on what's really happening in Saudi Arabia to give us his expert take on that.
[01:07:11.007 --> 01:07:22.439]  A lot of evidence points towards this being a false flag, an inside job, and the president has come out and said that he talked to the king this morning.
[01:07:22.459 --> 01:07:23.980]  He didn't want to elaborate on what he said.
[01:07:24.844 --> 01:07:33.309]  But that basically he said that he believed that this was a rogue group of killers clearly meant to shut up the Saudi regime while they're trying to reform and fix things.
[01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:35.070]  And who doesn't want peace in the area?
[01:07:35.311 --> 01:07:35.911]  The globalists.
[01:07:36.211 --> 01:07:36.851]  The deep staters.
[01:07:37.152 --> 01:07:38.232]  They want the strategy of tension.
[01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:47.338]  Just spoke the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge whatsoever may have happened to our Saudi Arabian citizen.
[01:07:47.698 --> 01:07:50.140]  He said that they are working closely with Turkey to find an answer.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:53.322]  I am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with
[01:07:54.397 --> 01:08:04.819]  The King, who's buying hundreds of billions of dollars of equipment from us, but more importantly who's liberalizing for women to be able to drive, women to be able to have jobs.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:10.361]  They're really moving in the right direction and they've promised to stop arming Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:08:10.381 --> 01:08:15.082]  We'll break it down next hour, but here's the President before he took off in the helicopter this morning.
[01:08:15.916 --> 01:08:28.059]  I just spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia, who denies any knowledge of what took place with regard to, as he said, his Saudi Arabian citizen.
[01:08:29.379 --> 01:08:38.881]  I've asked, and he firmly denied that, I've asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately get on a plane, go to Saudi Arabia,
[01:08:39.921 --> 01:08:44.230]  Go to other places if necessary, which he probably will.
[01:08:44.831 --> 01:08:47.917]  But with regard to this, go to Turkey if necessary.
[01:08:48.971 --> 01:08:58.340]  The King told me that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are working hand in hand very closely on getting to the bottom of what happened.
[01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:00.823]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:09:00.963 --> 01:09:08.010]  But Mike Pompeo, excuse me, Mike Pompeo is leaving literally within an hour or so.
[01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:10.312]  He's heading to Saudi Arabia.
[01:09:11.233 --> 01:09:11.754]  We are
[01:09:13.092 --> 01:09:13.672]  So there you go.
[01:09:13.712 --> 01:09:16.614]  And the word I got from high-level Pentagon sources last week
[01:09:42.185 --> 01:10:01.497]  And then the guest we had on yesterday separately called me and confirmed from his sources, and he had lunch and played golf with some top generals who are actively involved in intelligence, that they're saying this is a way to derail Trump and the peace deal because Obama doesn't want to have a peace deal with Iran terminated, basically.
[01:10:02.057 --> 01:10:05.459]  So he wants to get the peace deal with Saudi Arabia to stop destabilizing.
[01:10:05.759 --> 01:10:11.283]  They want to have that shut down so that the region stays in massive turmoil.
[01:10:12.665 --> 01:10:15.067]  So there is the key report on that front.
[01:10:24.893 --> 01:10:33.338]  But the first thing I want to go ahead and get to here now, before I go to break and come back, and I'm going to do the whole 60 minutes pieces for the president and how critical those are.
[01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:39.382]  The first thing I'm going to get to here is this piece.
[01:10:40.876 --> 01:10:44.739]  Dim's third string defeated by Make America Great Again.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.861]  Another key John Bowne report.
[01:10:46.881 --> 01:10:49.563]  We're going to go to this report here in just a moment.
[01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:50.303]  We're going to go to break.
[01:10:51.344 --> 01:10:52.145]  I'm going to get focused.
[01:10:52.165 --> 01:10:54.266]  I'm going to come back and play those clips like I told you you would.
[01:10:54.947 --> 01:10:59.951]  Because what Trump says coming up is so critical for Americans to understand.
[01:10:59.971 --> 01:11:06.216]  And if we can't get this, and if we can't understand what he's saying about China, we don't have a hope in hell.
[01:11:07.346 --> 01:11:11.267]  But if we do, we have a very good shot at turning this around and defeating the globalists.
[01:11:11.287 --> 01:11:16.469]  So I'm gonna get focused again, and I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna cover these key clips.
[01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:17.790]  Stay with us.
[01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:28.594]  President Trump spoke to a sea of red hats on the campus of Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, Kentucky, combating these words from former Vice President Joe Biden.
[01:11:29.174 --> 01:11:34.316]  This time, they, not you, have an ally in the White House.
[01:11:34.836 --> 01:11:36.717]  This time, they have an ally.
[01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:41.159]  There are a small percentage of the American people, virulent people.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.661]  Some of them the dregs of society.
[01:11:45.762 --> 01:11:59.293]  And instead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, safety for all, the president uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit.
[01:12:01.214 --> 01:12:04.717]  And to make sure that America's extraordinary comeback
[01:12:06.067 --> 01:12:09.548]  We want to make sure it continues full speed ahead.
[01:12:09.648 --> 01:12:16.211]  We don't want Democrats that are coming from a different place.
[01:12:17.091 --> 01:12:18.691]  We don't want them getting in office.
[01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:20.632]  All they'll do is obstruct.
[01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:24.914]  Under Republican leadership, America is booming.
[01:12:25.194 --> 01:12:25.994]  It's thriving.
[01:12:30.114 --> 01:12:36.580]  America is winning again because we are finally putting America first.
[01:12:43.962 --> 01:12:46.603]  Simultaneously, Biden was in Indiana.
[01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:53.305]  Stumping as the last resort for the Democratic Party, Hillary and Barack seem to have disappeared from the campaign trail.
[01:12:53.665 --> 01:13:03.768]  As Hillary is promoting incivility, and Barack had been promoting himself as usual, falsely claiming the current economic boom was all his own doing.
[01:13:04.048 --> 01:13:09.029]  But there was Biden, pushing the same propaganda the rest of the party had been clinging to.
[01:13:09.349 --> 01:13:13.950]  Under this president and the Republican Party, these values are being shredded.
[01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:16.950]  Our democracy is under assault.
[01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:21.051]  Our institutions are under attack.
[01:13:21.071 --> 01:13:24.632]  We have a president who's put his own interests before the ideals of this country.
[01:13:24.652 --> 01:13:26.492]  Amassing power and abusing power.
[01:13:26.512 --> 01:13:32.653]  Rather than asserting our values, the Republican Senate is choosing party over country, and they know that!
[01:13:32.693 --> 01:13:36.714]  They know that!
[01:13:36.754 --> 01:13:38.074]  The world is watching us, too.
[01:13:39.536 --> 01:13:42.847]  They see a president who has debased the values
[01:13:43.929 --> 01:13:46.631]  And ceded global leadership to tyrants and thugs.
[01:13:48.271 --> 01:13:54.795]  Taking the word, taking the word of a dictator like Putin over our intelligence services.
[01:13:56.056 --> 01:14:02.599]  Exchanging, exchanging what he calls love letters with a murderer, Kim Jong-un of North Korea.
[01:14:03.159 --> 01:14:11.124]  Praising dictators and autocrats, heads of state in China, Turkey, the Philippines, while at the same time castigating our allies.
[01:14:12.296 --> 01:14:14.457]  Our reputation internationally is cratering.
[01:14:15.238 --> 01:14:21.482]  The Democratic Party is clearly on its last leg, placing their hopes on unscathed newcomers.
[01:14:21.782 --> 01:14:29.427]  Their socialist message soldiering on, blind to Trump's achievements and deaf to the average American's demands.
[01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:35.991]  I want people to come into our country on a merit-based system.
[01:14:40.925 --> 01:14:49.371]  And I want them to help all of the great companies that are moving back into the United States.
[01:14:51.433 --> 01:14:52.854]  They're moving to Michigan.
[01:14:53.274 --> 01:14:54.695]  They're moving to Ohio.
[01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:57.057]  They're moving to Pennsylvania.
[01:14:57.877 --> 01:15:01.099]  They're moving to North and South Carolina.
[01:15:01.159 --> 01:15:01.960]  They're coming in.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.221]  They're moving to Florida.
[01:15:03.361 --> 01:15:08.385]  And yes, they're moving into Kentucky.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:14.781]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:23.943]  Alright, when we come back, powerful information from 60 Minutes.
[01:15:24.543 --> 01:15:27.064]  The news behind the news, the rest of the story straight ahead.
[01:15:27.604 --> 01:15:28.684]  Infowars.com.
[01:15:28.764 --> 01:15:29.705]  Newswars.com.
[01:15:30.205 --> 01:15:32.905]  However you're listening, tell folks about it today.
[01:15:33.325 --> 01:15:35.186]  You are critical to the victory.
[01:15:43.857 --> 01:15:44.457]  Did you hear?
[01:15:44.838 --> 01:15:46.259]  Christmas is coming in October.
[01:15:46.819 --> 01:15:48.280]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:50.482]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[01:15:50.522 --> 01:15:57.287]  What's really coming in October is incredible deals, 50% off at InfoWarsTour.com and free shipping.
[01:15:58.028 --> 01:16:05.153]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[01:16:05.873 --> 01:16:10.577]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo bird.
[01:16:11.755 --> 01:16:15.258]  Or the way the dinosaurs, because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[01:16:16.499 --> 01:16:26.226]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[01:16:26.907 --> 01:16:31.671]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[01:16:31.731 --> 01:16:36.815]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[01:16:38.476 --> 01:16:51.825]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[01:16:52.405 --> 01:16:56.608]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[01:16:57.729 --> 01:17:03.112]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[01:17:03.492 --> 01:17:04.573]  Black Friday's coming early.
[01:17:05.467 --> 01:17:06.648]  Cyber Monday's coming up.
[01:17:06.788 --> 01:17:12.751]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[01:17:13.351 --> 01:17:18.733]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[01:17:19.554 --> 01:17:27.198]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:30.099]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:17:31.286 --> 01:17:36.647]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world.
[01:17:36.827 --> 01:17:39.368]  After Drudge Report, we went ahead and did video and audio.
[01:17:39.448 --> 01:17:41.268]  Number one in the election of Trump.
[01:17:41.689 --> 01:17:46.350]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:50.031]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[01:17:50.671 --> 01:17:55.632]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:58.933]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[01:17:59.953 --> 01:18:01.134]  Get your X2.
[01:18:01.334 --> 01:18:04.135]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[01:18:04.515 --> 01:18:05.756]  Rainforest, selling out, 50% off.
[01:18:05.776 --> 01:18:08.197]  Super Melon Doxality, 50% off.
[01:18:08.897 --> 01:18:10.518]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[01:18:10.558 --> 01:18:12.919]  Now, I do that with air filtration, water filtration.
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.701]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[01:18:16.961 --> 01:18:21.163]  And, free shipping, store-wide, M4MoreStore.com.
[01:18:21.443 --> 01:18:23.985]  So, this is the October
[01:18:25.524 --> 01:18:26.945]  Black Friday coming early.
[01:18:26.965 --> 01:18:28.525]  This is Christmas coming early.
[01:18:28.905 --> 01:18:30.446]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:32.647]  This is Christmas in October.
[01:18:33.227 --> 01:18:36.268]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[01:18:36.388 --> 01:18:37.209]  The five-star ratings.
[01:18:37.749 --> 01:18:40.770]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts so that you have them.
[01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.190]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:43.431]  Christmas is only two months away.
[01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:46.812]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products to win-win.
[01:18:46.832 --> 01:18:47.893]  I'm counting on you.
[01:18:47.933 --> 01:18:48.873]  You've always come through.
[01:18:49.313 --> 01:18:53.755]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[01:18:54.435 --> 01:18:59.177]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[01:19:00.177 --> 01:19:02.078]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:02.858]  Nobody's got that.
[01:19:03.578 --> 01:19:04.438]  Credit card processing.
[01:19:04.879 --> 01:19:06.899]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[01:19:07.179 --> 01:19:07.760]  We expose them.
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:11.881]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.

[01:19:41.817 --> 01:19:44.429]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.181]  I've got it.
[01:19:54.421 --> 01:20:00.087]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:20:00.167 --> 01:20:02.290]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:04.572 --> 01:20:10.198]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:19.886]  Coming up next segment, Macron says that Africa is now the epicenter of France and the French-speaking world.
[01:20:21.107 --> 01:20:26.371]  They should accept 200 million African migrants in the next 20 years to France.
[01:20:27.632 --> 01:20:30.875]  That would mean that France was two-thirds African.
[01:20:31.956 --> 01:20:35.238]  That's called economic cultural domination using a third world weapon.
[01:20:35.699 --> 01:20:37.160]  That's an Infowars.com story.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.221]  Next segment we're covering it.
[01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:40.663]  Then, speak of the devil,
[01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:44.040]  Maybe I'll just immigrate to Africa.
[01:20:44.721 --> 01:20:48.105]  Well, the communist leader there vows to take more white farmers' land.
[01:20:48.525 --> 01:20:50.408]  Even people that recently bought their land.
[01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.031]  They're just gonna take it.
[01:20:54.226 --> 01:20:57.087]  But that's okay, because only white people can be racist or tribal.
[01:20:57.647 --> 01:20:58.827]  Of course, that's a total lie.
[01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:04.609]  And when they're led by multinational corporations, any group becomes lawless and evil when they're told to behave like that.
[01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:07.509]  Very, very deadly dangerous, what the globalists are doing.
[01:21:07.789 --> 01:21:08.850]  That's the start of the next segment.
[01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:12.030]  Right now, we've been talking about it, but here's the video.
[01:21:12.571 --> 01:21:14.491]  Even Variety magazine got it right.
[01:21:14.911 --> 01:21:16.892]  60 Minutes was outmatched by Trump.
[01:21:18.272 --> 01:21:21.913]  And the article goes on to say that Leslie Stahl
[01:21:23.522 --> 01:21:26.364]  Interview with Trump was an undeniable get.
[01:21:26.684 --> 01:21:33.447]  He'd been scarce to mainstream media since around the time he appeared on tape with NBC's Lester Holt.
[01:21:34.368 --> 01:21:39.671]  And then it just goes on from there to say that he bulldozed his enemy in chief, the mainstream media.
[01:21:40.931 --> 01:21:41.632]  Now, why is that?
[01:21:41.672 --> 01:21:45.474]  Because I know for a fact Trump says, you're not going to substantively edit me.
[01:21:46.451 --> 01:21:47.652]  And if you do, I'm going to counter you.
[01:21:47.852 --> 01:21:52.096]  Just like NBC got caught lying saying he hated the North and hated Ulysses S. Grant.
[01:21:52.236 --> 01:21:52.776]  Was it true?
[01:21:53.377 --> 01:21:57.300]  Just like they said, oh, leaks have him saying he hates the South and Southerners.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.461]  It's not true either.
[01:21:58.741 --> 01:22:01.103]  They say he hates every group, hoping you believe it.
[01:22:01.403 --> 01:22:01.964]  None of it's true.
[01:22:03.705 --> 01:22:07.688]  But because he's able to counter their lies, he got a straight interview.
[01:22:08.309 --> 01:22:15.595]  She asked him a bunch of hard questions, but still he dominated her because they know he can punch back if they edited it.
[01:22:16.274 --> 01:22:22.339]  For everybody else, though, you can't do interviews with mainstream because they will edit you until it's unrecognizable.
[01:22:23.119 --> 01:22:25.021]  The full interview is on Infowars.com.
[01:22:25.561 --> 01:22:26.442]  I'm not president.
[01:22:28.023 --> 01:22:28.884]  You're not president.
[01:22:29.004 --> 01:22:31.005]  But President Trump is president.
[01:22:31.506 --> 01:22:34.008]  And he told her, I'm president and you're not.
[01:22:34.448 --> 01:22:36.149]  Trump mocks CBS anchor.
[01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:38.691]  Intense 60 minutes interview.
[01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:41.994]  Let's go ahead and go to the first clip that is the most important.
[01:22:43.355 --> 01:22:45.536]  And then I've got some very important words to say after it.
[01:22:45.637 --> 01:22:45.957]  Here it is.
[01:22:47.398 --> 01:22:47.778]  Putin.
[01:22:48.158 --> 01:22:48.379]  Yeah.
[01:22:48.719 --> 01:22:50.039]  Okay.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:55.802]  People don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.
[01:22:55.882 --> 01:22:56.483]  Okay, you're right.
[01:22:56.503 --> 01:22:57.603]  I don't understand.
[01:22:57.883 --> 01:23:01.065]  You don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference?
[01:23:01.085 --> 01:23:01.825]  I mean publicly.
[01:23:01.885 --> 01:23:03.406]  You never say anything harsh about him publicly.
[01:23:03.426 --> 01:23:03.626]  Excuse me.
[01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:04.007]  I didn't.
[01:23:04.647 --> 01:23:10.190]  I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.
[01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.030]  Obama didn't.
[01:23:11.050 --> 01:23:11.590]  You know what he said?
[01:23:13.348 --> 01:23:13.830]  Blankets.
[01:23:14.511 --> 01:23:21.148]  I'm the one and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this.
[01:23:21.248 --> 01:23:22.631]  I mean him personally.
[01:23:23.758 --> 01:23:26.059]  I think I'm very tough with him personally.
[01:23:26.239 --> 01:23:28.260]  I had a meeting with him, the two of us.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:31.542]  It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.
[01:23:31.782 --> 01:23:35.904]  Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?
[01:23:36.864 --> 01:23:37.804]  In poisonings?
[01:23:37.944 --> 01:23:39.805]  Probably he is, yeah, probably.
[01:23:40.306 --> 01:23:40.766]  Probably?
[01:23:40.886 --> 01:23:42.386]  Probably, but I rely on them.
[01:23:42.446 --> 01:23:43.827]  It's not in our country.
[01:23:43.847 --> 01:23:44.848]  Okay, but why not?
[01:23:45.228 --> 01:23:46.008]  They shouldn't do it.
[01:23:46.128 --> 01:23:47.189]  This is a terrible thing.
[01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:48.029]  Of course they shouldn't do it.
[01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:54.191]  Do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election?
[01:23:55.352 --> 01:23:57.853]  They meddled, but I think China meddled too.
[01:23:58.193 --> 01:24:01.294]  Why do you say China meddled too?
[01:24:01.334 --> 01:24:03.275]  Why don't you just say the Russians meddled?
[01:24:03.415 --> 01:24:05.136]  Because I think China meddled also.
[01:24:05.936 --> 01:24:09.678]  And I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem.
[01:24:09.698 --> 01:24:12.259]  You're diverting the whole Russian thing.
[01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:13.179]  I'm not doing anything.
[01:24:13.319 --> 01:24:16.100]  I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.
[01:24:18.928 --> 01:24:22.030]  China has a billion three hundred and fifty something million people.
[01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:24.532]  They put spy chips in all the Apple and other platforms.
[01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.393]  They openly bought Hollywood and our debt.
[01:24:26.793 --> 01:24:28.134]  They're trying to overthrow our country.
[01:24:28.154 --> 01:24:29.195]  They censor everything.
[01:24:30.776 --> 01:24:32.417]  Google and others are helping them censor.
[01:24:33.738 --> 01:24:36.179]  And then President Trump talks about it and he's the traitor.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.621]  Russia is the red herring.
[01:24:38.721 --> 01:24:40.402]  Russia wants an alliance with us.
[01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:42.203]  They would take the alliance.
[01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:47.547]  Then we would control Central Asia all the way out to East Asia.
[01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:52.021]  They have borders with North Korea, South Korea, we would control into Eastern Europe.
[01:24:52.341 --> 01:24:53.501]  It's the perfect alliance.
[01:24:53.541 --> 01:24:54.701]  The globalists don't want that.
[01:24:54.981 --> 01:24:56.142]  They want destabilization.
[01:24:56.682 --> 01:25:03.023]  Google's CEO tells senators that censored Chinese search engine could provide broad benefits.
[01:25:03.443 --> 01:25:04.944]  That was testimony last week.
[01:25:06.604 --> 01:25:15.146]  They say the head of Google, contradicting the person that testified a week before for Google, their spokesperson, their head of global policy and privacy,
[01:25:16.539 --> 01:25:20.181]  Said, yes, we are building a sensor-ship engine, and it's good, and you want it too!
[01:25:21.362 --> 01:25:23.103]  So see, this is getting sick.
[01:25:23.664 --> 01:25:24.304]  And there's another one.
[01:25:24.644 --> 01:25:27.926]  China is low-key taking over the world.
[01:25:28.627 --> 01:25:29.027]  Bloomberg!
[01:25:30.428 --> 01:25:36.232]  The rarest minerals, the ports, the infrastructure, and our elite have allowed them to do it on purpose!
[01:25:37.012 --> 01:25:37.913]  It's called treason!
[01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:42.116]  The big hack, how China used a tiny chip to infiltrate U.S.
[01:25:42.156 --> 01:25:43.096]  companies, the U.S.
[01:25:43.116 --> 01:25:44.117]  government, and your home.
[01:25:45.708 --> 01:25:50.970]  With the other chips they put in Chinese appliances, all coordinating, tracking you, stealing the data.
[01:25:52.410 --> 01:25:53.050]  And big U.S.
[01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:59.853]  companies use China as the fence so they can move there and become Chinese companies and get away with the illegal activity.
[01:26:00.993 --> 01:26:02.754]  Europe bans spying on you, the U.S.
[01:26:02.814 --> 01:26:04.314]  bans it, you just move to China, see?
[01:26:04.754 --> 01:26:09.356]  It's the base of operations of all this criminal activity now.
[01:26:11.837 --> 01:26:14.180]  And that's why what Trump is saying is so central and so important.
[01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:19.667]  He's pointing out the elephant in the room and not the red herring of Russia.
[01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:21.690]  Now let's go to this next clip.
[01:26:21.951 --> 01:26:26.236]  Trump, I never knew how dishonest the media was, he tells Leslie Stahl.
[01:26:26.937 --> 01:26:27.938]  I'm president and you're not.
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.727]  The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.
[01:26:34.468 --> 01:26:35.269]  And I really mean it.
[01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:36.792]  I'm not saying that as a soundbite.
[01:26:37.352 --> 01:26:40.177]  I never knew how dishonest... I'm going to change the subject again.
[01:26:40.337 --> 01:26:43.141]  No, but even the way you asked me a question, like about separation.
[01:26:43.421 --> 01:26:43.542]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.962 --> 01:26:46.063]  When I say Obama did it, you don't want to talk about it.
[01:26:46.083 --> 01:26:46.243]  No.
[01:26:46.443 --> 01:26:47.984]  When I say I did it, let's make a big deal out of it.
[01:26:48.004 --> 01:26:50.425]  I'm going to run your answer, but you did it four times.
[01:26:50.505 --> 01:26:55.127]  I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.
[01:26:55.547 --> 01:26:57.848]  I disagree, but I don't want to have that fight with you.
[01:26:58.028 --> 01:26:58.608]  Hey, it's okay.
[01:26:58.648 --> 01:26:59.609]  Or whatever, another fight with you.
[01:26:59.629 --> 01:27:00.229]  Leslie, it's okay.
[01:27:00.249 --> 01:27:02.430]  In the meantime, I'm president, and you're not.
[01:27:04.651 --> 01:27:06.271]  That's called annihilating somebody.
[01:27:07.692 --> 01:27:10.153]  Here's Trump getting into politics.
[01:27:10.213 --> 01:27:12.174]  It's vicious, full of lies, deceit, and deception.
[01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:17.531]  I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah blah.
[01:27:18.451 --> 01:27:19.372]  Now I say they're babies.
[01:27:20.232 --> 01:27:20.992]  Who's the toughest?
[01:27:21.112 --> 01:27:21.912]  The political people.
[01:27:22.212 --> 01:27:25.353]  This is the most deceptive, vicious world.
[01:27:26.213 --> 01:27:30.054]  It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception.
[01:27:30.434 --> 01:27:33.555]  You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table.
[01:27:33.835 --> 01:27:34.675]  Give me an example.
[01:27:34.755 --> 01:27:35.776]  Well, I don't want to give you an example.
[01:27:35.796 --> 01:27:40.097]  I'm not looking at... In the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do.
[01:27:40.697 --> 01:27:41.157]  Remember that.
[01:27:41.784 --> 01:27:49.349]  When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at making deals with other countries, nobody's been able to do anything like this.
[01:27:49.809 --> 01:27:53.712]  Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it.
[01:27:54.072 --> 01:27:56.013]  But, it's a very deceptive world.
[01:27:56.033 --> 01:27:58.335]  What he said there is so critical.
[01:27:59.838 --> 01:28:08.246]  When you don't go along with a swamp, either Republican or Democrat in the past, they come after you, your business, your name, your family, your credit, your credit card processing.
[01:28:09.127 --> 01:28:09.888]  They demonize you.
[01:28:09.908 --> 01:28:10.628]  They lie about you.
[01:28:10.709 --> 01:28:11.689]  Everybody's been intimidated.
[01:28:12.751 --> 01:28:24.282]  But Trump has shown rare leadership in taking all the arrows, going over the top, delivering victory, and now blowing a hole in the globalist operation through which we can enter.
[01:28:25.322 --> 01:28:28.649]  But of course, you know who was there first, helping blow the original hole.
[01:28:29.190 --> 01:28:30.533]  We planted the detonator.
[01:28:30.893 --> 01:28:31.735]  Trump hit the button.
[01:28:32.136 --> 01:28:35.763]  You, as the Infowars audience, are the ones that built the detonator.

[01:29:25.752 --> 01:29:28.095]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.

[01:29:41.861 --> 01:29:44.004]  We have launched the biggest sale in our history.
[01:29:44.044 --> 01:29:45.005]  We're planning for Christmas.
[01:29:45.886 --> 01:29:49.911]  But because they're racing to try to shut us down, all the rest of it, they've taken PayPal from us.
[01:29:49.931 --> 01:29:51.774]  They're trying to get our other payment processors.
[01:29:51.874 --> 01:29:53.376]  This is real racketeering.
[01:29:53.616 --> 01:29:57.881]  Combats, cartels, working in unison to punish people politically.
[01:29:58.722 --> 01:30:02.004]  For winning an American resurgence in free market and family values.
[01:30:02.065 --> 01:30:03.826]  This is true bullying.
[01:30:03.846 --> 01:30:07.008]  We're launching the Christmas Black Friday Cyber Monday all rolled into one.
[01:30:07.148 --> 01:30:07.869]  All the specials.
[01:30:07.929 --> 01:30:11.231]  We were planning for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Christmas.
[01:30:11.351 --> 01:30:12.131]  We're still around then.
[01:30:12.412 --> 01:30:14.073]  Seriously, I got good cheer about this.
[01:30:14.113 --> 01:30:15.794]  We've already devastated the globalists and I hope we'll be
[01:30:15.794 --> 01:30:22.555]  We'll be around, I'm sure in some permutation, but you need to get the products now and support the broadcast so we can be bunkered in, hunkered in, you know.
[01:30:22.615 --> 01:30:23.796]  Supply the Alamo!
[01:30:23.856 --> 01:30:30.137]  We promise we won't give up, but it'd be good to have a little bacon and a little beans to whip the bloody British in the town of New Orleans.
[01:30:30.357 --> 01:30:37.059]  So, they hate you supporting us, you get great products, you beat the globalists, 50% off all InfoWars Live products, super safe.
[01:30:37.199 --> 01:30:40.819]  And we're just gonna continue through the month of October while supplies last of each product.
[01:30:40.899 --> 01:30:43.180]  Free shipping store-wide on top of it.

[01:31:17.427 --> 01:31:19.167]  When we sell it $150, we're making like $25, they're making $25.
[01:31:22.168 --> 01:31:22.729]  You know what?
[01:31:39.591 --> 01:31:42.233]  50% off, because we're going to build our war chest.
[01:31:42.253 --> 01:31:45.376]  They want to shut down this year ahead of trying to destroy Trump.
[01:31:45.476 --> 01:31:49.100]  And so we need to fill our coffers that are running on the low end.
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.481]  You know, we're not on empty.
[01:31:50.521 --> 01:31:51.342]  We're not on reserve.

[01:32:28.893 --> 01:32:34.117]  They're trying to stop you, don't let them.
[01:32:41.884 --> 01:32:44.526]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:04.809]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:06.209 --> 01:33:15.952]  You know, most folks can't listen to this song.
[01:33:16.032 --> 01:33:17.312]  No more Mr. Nice Guy to relate.
[01:33:17.432 --> 01:33:18.052]  But I can.
[01:33:18.912 --> 01:33:19.913]  I got no friends.
[01:33:23.474 --> 01:33:24.434]  They can't be seen.
[01:33:24.914 --> 01:33:26.614]  With me.
[01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.435]  But those were never my real friends.
[01:33:30.894 --> 01:33:36.239]  The truth is, I can't imagine being attacked by the papers back when most people believed them 30, 40, 50 years ago.
[01:33:36.819 --> 01:33:42.544]  Almost no one believes mainstream media now, so we've got more listeners, more fans, more supporters than ever.
[01:33:43.025 --> 01:33:44.766]  But, here's the difference.
[01:33:45.067 --> 01:33:51.653]  The people that do believe mainstream media are more zombie-like, more aggressive, more crazy, more vicious than ever.
[01:33:54.053 --> 01:33:57.416]  We're joined here in just a moment by Joey Gibson, who leads up the Patriot Prayer Group.
[01:33:57.436 --> 01:34:05.442]  I guess they have their fourth rally in Portland, Oregon, where Antifa comes out and attacks everyone.
[01:34:07.364 --> 01:34:16.011]  And we've seen the mayor letting people block roads and beat up innocent people and pull old people out of cars and beat their vehicles with metal batons.
[01:34:19.335 --> 01:34:23.018]  And so I saw the national news with the mayor defending it and all the rest of it.
[01:34:23.058 --> 01:34:32.144]  Ted Wheeler, Portland mayor, stands by decision to allow Antifa to block traffic, trying to get cars to run over them so they can scream, I guess, Charlottesville again.
[01:34:32.164 --> 01:34:43.812]  And then national media is saying it's Nazis rallying, but there's more people with brown skin at Joey Gibson's rallies than there are with the meth-head, almost all-white Antifa goonsquats.
[01:34:45.489 --> 01:34:50.212]  So I wanted to get him on, since this was national news yesterday and today, to find out what really happened.
[01:34:50.232 --> 01:34:51.653]  I mean, you can all go watch the videos.
[01:34:51.673 --> 01:34:53.795]  You see Antifa attacking first.
[01:34:53.815 --> 01:34:55.536]  You see the police standing down.
[01:34:55.576 --> 01:35:01.920]  You saw the footage last week of Antifa blocking roads during rush hour and again chasing people down in their vehicles.
[01:35:02.521 --> 01:35:07.324]  White people screaming and old white people saying, you effing dumb old stupid white person.
[01:35:07.864 --> 01:35:08.765]  You're a Nazi.
[01:35:09.165 --> 01:35:10.006]  I mean, it's just...
[01:35:10.746 --> 01:35:11.767]  Total mental illness.
[01:35:11.907 --> 01:35:13.108]  What is the rhyme or reason?
[01:35:13.388 --> 01:35:16.171]  Because Soros is the main funder of Antifa.
[01:35:16.531 --> 01:35:17.972]  They are centrally controlled.
[01:35:18.373 --> 01:35:29.122]  So to give us a bird's eye view and also a point-blank range in the field view is Joey Gibson, founder of the Patriot Prayer Group, gibsonforfreedom.com.
[01:35:29.402 --> 01:35:30.604]  He joins us.
[01:35:30.624 --> 01:35:32.645]  So thanks for joining us, my friend.
[01:35:34.006 --> 01:35:34.867]  Thank you for having me.
[01:35:34.907 --> 01:35:36.509]  It's my pleasure to be here.
[01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:41.682]  You know, it was you guys that had the idea to have the Free Alex Jones rally that a few hundred folks showed up to a few weeks ago.
[01:35:42.122 --> 01:35:44.004]  I knew about it like the last day of it came down.
[01:35:44.785 --> 01:35:48.188]  But then that spurred Free Alex Jones movements, I know, all over the country.
[01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:48.888]  So great job.
[01:35:50.130 --> 01:35:56.655]  Fill people in on Portland, why it's the epicenter of this and some of the history and then what happened last night or yesterday.
[01:35:57.516 --> 01:35:57.816]  Sure.
[01:35:57.917 --> 01:36:03.862]  So we've been traveling around on the West Coast to certain cities, especially where the mayors have the police stand down.
[01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:10.475]  And over time, the mayors have kind of given up and they've allowed the police to do their job.
[01:36:10.535 --> 01:36:18.341]  Portland's kind of one of the last cities where they find it acceptable where people can just go out on the streets, do whatever they want, and they don't have to pay the consequences.
[01:36:18.908 --> 01:36:30.138]  So basically what happened a little over a week ago, a black man was shot and they had a memorial on the corner that he was at and they were literally going out redirecting traffic.
[01:36:30.198 --> 01:36:34.342]  They took over the streets and they were telling people where they could or could not go.
[01:36:34.962 --> 01:36:36.143]  One man called the police.
[01:36:36.283 --> 01:36:38.245]  There's a video of it and an older man.
[01:36:39.605 --> 01:36:40.826]  You know, they did not respond.
[01:36:40.946 --> 01:36:45.370]  And then they start yelling at him, calling him a white supremacist, because he's from North Carolina.
[01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:49.014]  They start judging him because of the state that he's from, which is complete bigotry.
[01:36:49.114 --> 01:36:50.735]  Like, everything they say, they're against.
[01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:58.222]  So in response, to put more pressure on the mayor, we had a march and rally on Saturday.
[01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:06.450]  Within 24 hours, you know, we had, you know, a few hundred people show up because people are so angry and it was a great turnout and the mayor had to respond.
[01:37:06.490 --> 01:37:12.192]  He finally had a press conference and he justified it, said that it's okay that the police didn't respond.
[01:37:12.552 --> 01:37:16.654]  He also, at the same time, said motorists should feel safe in Portland.
[01:37:17.195 --> 01:37:17.355]  Nope.
[01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:18.455]  No, they shouldn't.
[01:37:18.475 --> 01:37:19.996]  They'll feel safe when you enforce the law.
[01:37:20.036 --> 01:37:20.676]  It's that simple.
[01:37:21.917 --> 01:37:23.978]  And so you guys decided to have another event this weekend.
[01:37:23.998 --> 01:37:24.598]  Tell us about that.
[01:37:27.645 --> 01:37:28.405]  This weekend?
[01:37:28.866 --> 01:37:30.207]  I'm not having another event this weekend.
[01:37:30.727 --> 01:37:35.750]  Well, I just saw all over the news that they were saying Patriot prayer attacked.
[01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:39.092]  It was big headlines in the last two days.
[01:37:39.152 --> 01:37:40.453]  So I know there was other events.
[01:37:40.773 --> 01:37:42.114]  And so I guess they had another Patriot prayer.
[01:37:42.134 --> 01:37:43.355]  I mean, tell us about what happened to this event.
[01:37:45.636 --> 01:37:47.077]  I don't know which event you're talking about.
[01:37:47.117 --> 01:37:51.840]  What we are going to do, though, is we are going November 6th at City Hall.
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:55.862]  There's going to be a whole bunch of people on the left who are going to protest the mayor.
[01:37:56.422 --> 01:37:57.223]  So I'm going to
[01:37:57.708 --> 01:38:07.635]  Throw an event to kind of show up with them, so both sides can kind of come together and protest this mayor, because there's so many reasons to not like this mayor, whether you're left or right.
[01:38:08.176 --> 01:38:09.917]  The guy's, number one, the guy's a liar.
[01:38:09.977 --> 01:38:16.682]  He's bought and paid for, and he'll say and do whatever it takes in order to protect his position as mayor.
[01:38:18.322 --> 01:38:27.745]  Well, see, I just said, hey, get Joey Gibson on, and there's so many fights and so much anti-violence around the country, you may not even know, it was topofdrugsreport.com yesterday.
[01:38:29.005 --> 01:38:29.285]  I don't
[01:38:48.746 --> 01:38:53.590]  Yeah, I mean, last Saturday was my event, but in terms of this weekend, I don't know if people are planning on doing something.
[01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:55.011]  If they are, good for them.
[01:38:55.031 --> 01:38:56.452]  I'll make sure I'll be there and support them.
[01:39:17.984 --> 01:39:29.850]  Well, then, because this was all over mainstream news yesterday, so it looks like there must have been some other something happened, as street fights break out all over the country, and they just think now all opposition to Antifa's Patriot Prayer.
[01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:36.214]  I mean, so many times I get credit for stuff, hey, your InfoWars people were out doing this, and it wasn't even InfoWars.
[01:39:36.454 --> 01:39:38.195]  So I think that's probably the level you've now reached.
[01:39:39.244 --> 01:39:40.125]  Well, that's a good sign.
[01:39:40.145 --> 01:39:41.046]  I mean, amen to that.
[01:39:41.086 --> 01:39:41.487]  I'm glad.
[01:39:41.527 --> 01:39:45.152]  But as long as, you know, I do this so that other people will do it.
[01:39:45.332 --> 01:39:46.754]  You know, that's the main thing.
[01:39:46.774 --> 01:39:47.875]  We want to motivate other people.
[01:39:47.895 --> 01:39:48.996]  We want to inspire other people.
[01:39:49.036 --> 01:39:49.817]  That's why we do that.
[01:39:49.857 --> 01:39:56.686]  And so I think that there is a movement, especially in Portland, people are starting to understand that we don't have to sit around anymore.
[01:39:56.706 --> 01:39:58.008]  We don't have to sit around and allow
[01:39:58.513 --> 01:40:03.298]  Whether it be Antifa or the mayor or the lack of police response, you don't have to take it anymore.
[01:40:03.338 --> 01:40:06.400]  You can go out on the streets and you can make sure your voice is heard.
[01:40:06.841 --> 01:40:08.142]  And you don't have to hide anymore.
[01:40:08.162 --> 01:40:11.365]  I don't care if you're conservative, libertarian, moderate.
[01:40:11.405 --> 01:40:12.046]  It doesn't matter.
[01:40:12.086 --> 01:40:12.846]  You don't have to hide.
[01:40:12.907 --> 01:40:14.888]  You don't have to be ashamed of who you are.
[01:40:15.249 --> 01:40:16.170]  Just go out there.
[01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:17.050]  Say who you are.
[01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:18.552]  Be unafraid and unapologetic.
[01:40:18.772 --> 01:40:21.697]  Well, Joey, you're doing it, because you're learning about this now.
[01:40:21.777 --> 01:40:30.271]  There's another, just people spontaneously showed up Saturday night and then again Sunday, and it all exploded when they attacked them, calling themselves Patriot Prayers.
[01:40:30.291 --> 01:40:32.114]  So the chain reaction has now happened.
[01:40:32.174 --> 01:40:32.995]  What do you make of
[01:40:34.341 --> 01:40:40.163]  Leftist groups, Democrats, top Hollywood people, Alec Baldwin calling for civil war, overthrowing the government.
[01:40:40.403 --> 01:40:41.824]  It's the latest thing Alec Baldwin said.
[01:40:41.864 --> 01:40:43.224]  We quote, need to overthrow the government.
[01:40:43.665 --> 01:40:45.125]  They're the ones out pushing violence.
[01:40:45.165 --> 01:40:47.726]  And then they go, oh, the Republicans are going low.
[01:40:47.786 --> 01:40:57.110]  We got to go lower, pretending like we're the ones that are starting stuff and we're the ones that are being violent and acting like Trump made it up, that they're acting like mob rule.
[01:40:57.130 --> 01:41:02.932]  I think that, you know, it's just another attempt where, you know, we're living in an era of deception.
[01:41:03.388 --> 01:41:04.268]  I see it all the time.
[01:41:04.288 --> 01:41:05.429]  You know, I get so much hatred.
[01:41:05.489 --> 01:41:07.550]  People say that I have hate speech and I don't.
[01:41:07.570 --> 01:41:09.251]  You know, so everything's flipped upside down.
[01:41:09.751 --> 01:41:11.072]  Honestly, I think it's a good sign.
[01:41:11.112 --> 01:41:12.272]  I think they're on their last leg.
[01:41:12.572 --> 01:41:13.493]  They're so desperate.
[01:41:13.513 --> 01:41:14.893]  Elections are coming up.
[01:41:14.913 --> 01:41:15.774]  You know, they banned you.
[01:41:15.814 --> 01:41:19.035]  They took you off of all the social media because they're losing the culture war.
[01:41:19.055 --> 01:41:19.836]  They're being destroyed.
[01:41:19.916 --> 01:41:22.437]  Finally, conservatives are getting involved in the culture war.
[01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:46.286]  Conservative libertarians are finally starting to push back and so now they don't know what to do because for the longest time we just took it and took it and took it while they just slowly took away this country whether it be the schools, you know, the the media, Hollywood, all that stuff and now they have this weird punk movement for freedom that's completely taken over especially the youth and people are loving it and people are inspired by it.
[01:41:46.727 --> 01:41:49.809]  One thing I was talking to someone about the other day, you know,
[01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:58.027]  Violence is one part of what's happening on the streets, but you can kind of look at the violence and you can kind of learn something from that.
[01:41:58.368 --> 01:41:59.531]  If you look at our people,
[01:42:00.562 --> 01:42:03.765]  There's a lot of people that are willing to bleed for this movement.
[01:42:03.785 --> 01:42:05.526]  They're willing to bleed for freedom.
[01:42:06.287 --> 01:42:11.171]  But the other side, they're not willing to bleed because it's for selfish reasons why they do what they do.
[01:42:11.511 --> 01:42:13.072]  That's why they're so selfish.
[01:42:13.092 --> 01:42:16.755]  They're not even willing to show their face to be a face for their movement.
[01:42:16.795 --> 01:42:17.996]  That's how selfish they are.
[01:42:18.096 --> 01:42:18.777]  You just said it.
[01:42:18.837 --> 01:42:22.160]  The globalists and their minions are not willing to bleed and it's why they're going to lose.
[01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:24.137]  Absolutely.
[01:42:24.537 --> 01:42:29.143]  Because if you've got spirit and you know you're doing it for the right reason, you realize blood means nothing.
[01:42:29.684 --> 01:42:32.848]  But if you're not willing to sacrifice the blood, you're gonna lose everything.
[01:42:32.888 --> 01:42:36.632]  We'll be right back with Joey Gibson on the other side, InfoWars.com.
[01:42:38.211 --> 01:42:44.494]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[01:42:44.554 --> 01:42:45.634]  They know how the world really works.
[01:42:46.475 --> 01:42:48.976]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[01:42:49.036 --> 01:42:50.277]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[01:42:50.837 --> 01:42:57.700]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:06.204]  But in four wars, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros, the Democratic Party, and the EU, and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[01:43:07.230 --> 01:43:11.891]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:16.552]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[01:43:16.672 --> 01:43:25.714]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, so I know their larger game plan.
[01:43:25.854 --> 01:43:28.315]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[01:43:28.735 --> 01:43:30.995]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:32.736]  Now you've seen massive
[01:43:33.476 --> 01:43:41.440]  Corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[01:43:42.140 --> 01:43:46.923]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[01:43:46.983 --> 01:43:52.045]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[01:43:53.726 --> 01:44:07.049]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday, and of course for Cyber Monday, and for Christmas!
[01:44:07.649 --> 01:44:11.829]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[01:44:12.970 --> 01:44:18.451]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[01:44:18.731 --> 01:44:19.811]  Black Friday's coming early.
[01:44:20.706 --> 01:44:21.887]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[01:44:22.027 --> 01:44:26.371]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[01:44:26.952 --> 01:44:32.337]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[01:44:33.178 --> 01:44:40.665]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[01:44:41.566 --> 01:44:43.708]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[01:44:44.907 --> 01:44:54.871]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[01:44:55.311 --> 01:45:00.013]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[01:45:00.514 --> 01:45:03.655]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[01:45:04.315 --> 01:45:09.277]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[01:45:09.297 --> 01:45:12.559]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[01:45:13.559 --> 01:45:14.761]  Get your X2.
[01:45:15.341 --> 01:45:17.764]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[01:45:18.104 --> 01:45:19.987]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[01:45:20.347 --> 01:45:21.809]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:24.152]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[01:45:24.192 --> 01:45:26.554]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[01:45:26.895 --> 01:45:28.817]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off.
[01:45:29.318 --> 01:45:30.339]  But they're discounted as well.
[01:45:30.579 --> 01:45:30.719]  And...

[01:45:58.775 --> 01:46:06.565]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have, they want to shut down because we're successful and we expose them.

[01:46:30.929 --> 01:46:33.070]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[01:46:41.884 --> 01:46:46.068]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:50.392 --> 01:47:03.904]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:04.665 --> 01:47:06.186]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:06.627 --> 01:47:07.748]  Longing for the sun.
[01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:30.711]  So let me ask Joey Gibson, the founder of the Patriot Paragroup, who goes out and peacefully just marches and then gets attacked by the left all over the West Coast and all over the country.
[01:47:31.211 --> 01:47:33.412]  Alec Baldwin has come out, he's in the Union Leader.
[01:47:34.132 --> 01:47:35.372]  There's video of it.
[01:47:35.792 --> 01:47:37.433]  We need to overthrow the government.
[01:47:38.713 --> 01:47:40.894]  That's what Alec Baldwin has come out and said.
[01:47:42.389 --> 01:47:52.733]  Fresh off his first appearance on the season as President Trump on Saturday Night Live, actor Alec Baldwin headlined the New Hampshire Democratic Party's inaugural Eleanor Roosevelt dinner Sunday night at the Manchester Down Hotel.
[01:47:52.753 --> 01:47:58.395]  And he said, the way we implement change in America is through elections, Baldwin said.
[01:47:59.915 --> 01:48:04.277]  In that orderly way, we need to overthrow the government of the United States under Donald Trump.
[01:48:04.717 --> 01:48:09.799]  Not in a violent, awful way, but it must be overthrown nonetheless.
[01:48:10.953 --> 01:48:14.239]  Let's make America great again by making Donald Trump a casino operator again.
[01:48:15.301 --> 01:48:17.244]  Baldwin won an Emmy last year, blah blah blah.
[01:48:18.763 --> 01:48:22.164]  Well, at least Alec Baldwin will say he wants to make America great again.
[01:48:22.224 --> 01:48:28.125]  But the rhetoric of him and the former Attorney General about, when they go low, we kick them, kick them, kick them, fight, fight, fight.
[01:48:28.545 --> 01:48:30.486]  And then Maxine Waters saying, chase people around.
[01:48:30.826 --> 01:48:32.626]  They're getting more violent everywhere.
[01:48:32.646 --> 01:48:35.067]  They're attacking people more and more everywhere.
[01:48:35.087 --> 01:48:47.170]  And as you said, as the police finally, in places like San Francisco and Austin, Texas, stand up to Antifa when they're physically attacking people, their only refuge is places like Portland, Oregon.
[01:48:48.217 --> 01:48:56.505]  Where do you see this going in the next 22 days till the election, Joey Gibson, versus if they lose or if they win?
[01:48:56.585 --> 01:49:01.190]  What do you expect them to do the next 22 days, but what do you expect them to do if they win or if they lose?
[01:49:02.852 --> 01:49:04.974]  You know, I've been thinking about that a lot lately.
[01:49:05.774 --> 01:49:07.455]  I like to look at it this way.
[01:49:07.575 --> 01:49:13.398]  So I'm pretty optimistic about the way the elections are going to go in November, even with the cheating going on.
[01:49:13.418 --> 01:49:18.441]  I kind of look at it like, you know, a child cries really hard the first time they're shocked.
[01:49:18.661 --> 01:49:21.342]  Second time, I like to think they're not going to cry as hard.
[01:49:21.743 --> 01:49:23.864]  I don't think they're going to riot, hopefully.
[01:49:24.984 --> 01:49:28.746]  And so I think that things will be a little bit more calm if we end up winning.
[01:49:29.467 --> 01:49:30.087]  But we'll see.
[01:49:30.598 --> 01:49:34.420]  What I'm really looking forward to, though, is the 2020 election.
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:41.825]  I think that Trump has a really good chance of winning, especially if the economy continues to increase.
[01:49:41.905 --> 01:49:45.367]  And I'm really excited to be able to go out there in 2020 and be able to rally.
[01:49:45.387 --> 01:49:47.708]  And I think that's when things are going to get crazy.
[01:49:48.109 --> 01:49:53.492]  It seems like people care more about presidential elections than they do midterm, even though midterm is really important.
[01:49:55.367 --> 01:49:58.928]  Why do you think the left are such short-lipped losers this time?
[01:49:59.748 --> 01:50:05.989]  I think it's because they believe their globalist utopia, their socialist utopia, was going to be delivered by Hillary.
[01:50:06.429 --> 01:50:11.550]  And they had all these plans ready to censor the press and break up the families and open the borders.
[01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:15.911]  But because Trump got in there as a stopgap, that has just enraged them.
[01:50:18.091 --> 01:50:24.192]  Well, it's hard because a lot of these people, you know, no offense to them, they've built an ideology that's not from logic.
[01:50:24.824 --> 01:50:26.525]  You know, freedom isn't their main focus.
[01:50:26.746 --> 01:50:30.309]  For them, it's about emotions and how they feel and this and that.
[01:50:30.549 --> 01:50:38.315]  Especially if you look at socialism or if you look at people who want health care for everybody, they're not thinking about the fact that we don't understand where the money would come from.
[01:50:38.615 --> 01:50:42.298]  But emotionally, it sounds good to them because they're like, everybody can have health care.
[01:50:42.739 --> 01:50:46.742]  And so a lot of the times they don't get what they want and they start to freak out and they just have meltdowns.
[01:50:46.802 --> 01:50:50.065]  It's things that I've never thought that I would see in my entire life.
[01:50:50.558 --> 01:50:53.619]  When you go on the streets and these people absolutely despise me.
[01:50:53.659 --> 01:50:56.519]  They hate me so much and they don't even know why.
[01:50:56.579 --> 01:50:59.500]  And they're literally like, like foaming from the mouth.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:00.620]  Like that's not even a joke.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.881]  I know you guys have seen that a lot.
[01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:04.521]  They're foaming from their mouth and they're yelling and they're screaming.
[01:51:04.941 --> 01:51:10.903]  And they say some of the most vile, hateful things you can even think of, especially when they get on that bullhorn.
[01:51:11.223 --> 01:51:12.703]  And then they say that I have hate speech.
[01:51:12.743 --> 01:51:14.924]  So I don't really, Alex, I don't have the answer for you.
[01:51:14.944 --> 01:51:16.424]  I don't know why they do what they do.
[01:51:16.884 --> 01:51:18.885]  It's just, it's beyond reason anymore.
[01:51:18.925 --> 01:51:20.145]  I used to try to figure it out.
[01:51:20.609 --> 01:51:22.909]  But when you ask them questions, they don't have answers.
[01:51:23.250 --> 01:51:24.090]  They have no answers.
[01:51:24.170 --> 01:51:25.290]  That's what I don't understand.
[01:51:25.830 --> 01:51:28.891]  You know, so, I don't know Alex, but it's really frustrating.
[01:51:29.451 --> 01:51:32.632]  Well, let's talk about this because there's so many studies that will make your head spin.
[01:51:32.692 --> 01:51:47.095]  Thousands that say smartphones and over-television watching makes you lose your humanity, lose your humility, become irritable, and that over-smartphone use and all this is connected to people basically becoming animals.
[01:51:47.115 --> 01:51:48.335]  And you see that in the Kingsman
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:55.404]  Her Majesty's Secret Service where the evil guy sends out the wavelength over the cell phones to make everybody kill each other.
[01:51:55.885 --> 01:51:58.567]  Now that's an archetype of what's really going on, but see it.
[01:51:58.747 --> 01:52:06.853]  Patriots fans flip off Tyreek Hill, throw beer on him after Chiefs scores touchdown.
[01:52:08.166 --> 01:52:15.310]  And again, he wins the touchdown, he scores a touchdown, so they flip him off and throw beer on him, and I see this everywhere.
[01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:23.395]  People see it in relationships where there's not a governor, there's no respect for other people, and everyone is acting more and more like animals.
[01:52:23.415 --> 01:52:26.457]  I mean, I really think it's almost like a form of mass demon possession.
[01:52:27.917 --> 01:52:28.878]  Yeah, that's what I was just gonna say.
[01:52:28.898 --> 01:52:35.522]  I would say one thing that I would suggest for this country is that we bring God back into the culture, but not in a way where
[01:52:36.038 --> 01:52:38.000]  We're oppressive or we force it on people.
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.422]  You know, it's not even everyone, not everyone has to believe in God.
[01:52:41.462 --> 01:52:51.430]  But if it becomes more part of this culture, if you look at the things that Jesus taught, even if you don't believe he's the son of God, the things that he taught is having love for one another, having respect for one another.
[01:52:51.871 --> 01:52:53.432]  And I don't see that respect anymore.
[01:52:53.752 --> 01:52:58.736]  When I think about those guys out on the streets blocking traffic, number one, that's extremely disrespectful.
[01:52:58.776 --> 01:53:04.621]  But number two, to chase him down the street and start attacking him because he refuses to obey your orders.
[01:53:05.194 --> 01:53:11.656]  It's just disrespect for other humans, and it's something that we're losing in this culture, and I do believe it's 100% a spiritual problem.
[01:53:13.616 --> 01:53:33.901]  It is a spiritual problem, and if you listen and watch the Antifa people, they're literally like disempowered, weird, scummy, archetypal images of wimps, all out ganging up on people and just acting like virtue-signaling scum, and to see them totally tone-deaf,
[01:53:35.856 --> 01:53:38.758]  And not connected to reality is disgusting.
[01:53:40.039 --> 01:53:40.760]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:47.565]  One good example, when they were at the memorial before we went down, we sat down, Tiny and a couple other guys, to go talk to them.
[01:53:48.306 --> 01:53:52.689]  And they went live, and as they walked around talking to them, they asked them, you know, what happened?
[01:53:52.869 --> 01:53:56.152]  And they say, a police officer shot, you know, a black man.
[01:53:56.172 --> 01:53:57.853]  And it's like, okay, but what happened?
[01:53:58.013 --> 01:53:58.694]  And they don't know.
[01:53:58.714 --> 01:53:59.915]  They don't even have an answer.
[01:54:00.495 --> 01:54:03.738]  So they're down there protesting, and they don't even know what they're protesting.
[01:54:03.758 --> 01:54:04.979]  They don't even know what happened.
[01:54:05.526 --> 01:54:10.368]  You know, and the truth is, he did shoot two people, you know, and so I want a full investigation.
[01:54:10.408 --> 01:54:13.050]  I don't know what happened, but I mean... Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:54:13.130 --> 01:54:23.535]  Andy, what's shutting down the roads and the rioting is somebody reportedly, a black guy, shot two people before the cops shot him, before he got shot, and no one wants to even ask, was he guilty?
[01:54:23.955 --> 01:54:27.797]  Or were the police defending themselves, or were the citizens defending themselves?
[01:54:28.157 --> 01:54:31.119]  That's how this has gotten so crazy, and nobody wants anybody to die.
[01:54:31.139 --> 01:54:32.860]  We're trying to stop black babies being aborted.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:35.101]  Half the black folks in this country never get born.
[01:54:35.601 --> 01:54:36.923]  I love black people.
[01:54:36.943 --> 01:54:37.583]  I love everybody.
[01:54:37.864 --> 01:54:49.837]  But the idea that almost always when they claim it's a non-authorized shooting or an improper shooting, it's always never the truth and the mainstream media almost always covers up what really happened.
[01:54:51.474 --> 01:54:55.176]  It's all tribal thinking, you know, especially if you take the aborting the babies.
[01:54:55.536 --> 01:55:05.962]  If you really care about, you know, black, especially black babies, we can talk about the abortions, but people are so caught up in the left versus right paradigm that they don't really think about independent situations.
[01:55:05.982 --> 01:55:10.804]  You take even the police, you know, people refuse to look at each situation and each police officer.
[01:55:10.824 --> 01:55:14.546]  In almost every case, the person has shot somebody and is waving a gun around.
[01:55:16.047 --> 01:55:16.627]  Absolutely.
[01:55:16.647 --> 01:55:20.289]  I mean, you wave a gun around in front of cops or anybody, you're going to get shot.
[01:55:21.329 --> 01:55:23.111]  Most police officers are good people.
[01:55:23.171 --> 01:55:25.514]  I mean, most of them just want to do their job.
[01:55:25.554 --> 01:55:26.696]  They want to protect and serve.
[01:55:27.276 --> 01:55:32.022]  I can tell you, almost all police, they really don't want to shoot somebody and get sued and all the stuff that happens.
[01:55:32.283 --> 01:55:33.444]  Joey Gibson, great job.
[01:55:33.464 --> 01:55:36.267]  We'll be following your event and other events as they unfold.
[01:55:36.307 --> 01:55:37.008]  Keep it up, my friend.
[01:55:37.829 --> 01:55:38.110]  Thank you.
[01:55:39.352 --> 01:55:46.275]  All right, Dr. Steve Pucinich is going to join us next hour on what's really going on and why they're hyping this Saudi Arabian-slash-American journalist's death so much.
[01:55:46.776 --> 01:55:48.216]  Trump's saying it's a false flag.
[01:55:48.496 --> 01:55:49.657]  I told you that over the weekend.
[01:55:49.977 --> 01:55:51.858]  But we'll see what Steve Pucinich has to say.
[01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:55.140]  I don't know if he's going to agree with where I think this is pointing.
[01:55:55.180 --> 01:55:58.561]  He's got a lot of high-level sources, so we'll get all that information coming up.
[01:55:59.162 --> 01:55:59.862]  Listen, real quick.
[01:56:00.936 --> 01:56:11.257]  I'm very excited to announce a 35% off the super high quality storable foods at InfoWarStore.com that are powered by MyPatriotSupply.com.
[01:56:13.257 --> 01:56:21.759]  You saw Hurricane Michael create incredible devastation in the Florida Panhandle and knock out a lot of conservative voters, which really could be the Democrats' secret weapon.
[01:56:22.199 --> 01:56:27.441]  It's an example of how you can't just trust FEMA or the government to take care of you, even if Donald Trump's the president.
[01:56:28.001 --> 01:56:32.262]  You've got to be self-sufficient with high-quality, storable foods and water filtration.
[01:56:32.682 --> 01:56:36.343]  Both of those are produced by the great folks that run My Patriot Supply.
[01:56:36.684 --> 01:56:37.624]  They're huge sponsors.
[01:56:38.544 --> 01:56:42.887]  When you buy it at the lowest prices at InfoWareStore.com, you are funding our operation.
[01:56:43.447 --> 01:56:49.891]  So as Hurricane Michael recovery finally begins, the world can see in the aftermath how important survival preparation is.
[01:56:50.391 --> 01:56:54.214]  Even in emergency recovery, organizations like FEMA can be slow or unpredictable.
[01:56:54.274 --> 01:56:57.456]  Emergency response can take days, weeks, or months for aid.
[01:56:58.936 --> 01:56:59.697]  Look in Puerto Rico.
[01:57:00.237 --> 01:57:10.844]  That's why it's so important to make sure that you have the storable food you need to weather the storm today, with amounts ranging from three days to a whole year of storable food selection, to make sure you're not a victim in circumstance.
[01:57:11.384 --> 01:57:18.248]  You can stock up for yourself and help provide for your friends and family and neighbors in an emergency with affordable, high-quality, storable food that lasts 20-plus years.
[01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:25.293]  We're dropping prices for our storable food tips to help folks with Mike Lemore for 35% off to help at infowarestore.com.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:32.201]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[01:57:32.221 --> 01:57:37.043]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[01:57:37.203 --> 01:57:40.824]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[01:57:40.844 --> 01:57:43.325]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[01:57:43.566 --> 01:57:48.988]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients while keeping the cost low.
[01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:54.650]  Since we wanted to make sure that you got the best value possible, we've now switched to a new supplier with even better ingredients.
[01:57:54.730 --> 01:57:57.091]  That's why it's now the Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[01:57:57.151 --> 01:57:59.172]  The incredible ingredients included in the Ultimate
[01:57:59.172 --> 01:58:07.875]  Ultimate Bone Broth Formula include Chicken Bone Broth, Turmeric Root, Chaga Mushroom, Bee Pollen, Goji Berry, and Alfalfa Herb Powder.
[01:58:08.015 --> 01:58:09.116]  And even more, of course.
[01:58:09.276 --> 01:58:18.799]  These powerful ingredients are going to help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.
[01:58:19.059 --> 01:58:26.002]  It's time to take advantage and pick up your bottle of an updated favorite formula with Ultimate Bone Broth from InfoWars Life.
[01:58:26.182 --> 01:58:26.582]  Thank you!
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:30.761]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:58:31.161 --> 01:58:37.425]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:58:37.785 --> 01:58:41.727]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:58:42.267 --> 01:58:54.714]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.

[01:59:16.966 --> 01:59:20.749]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:59:21.309 --> 01:59:26.013]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWarsLife at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:30.035 --> 01:59:35.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:49.446 --> 01:59:54.330]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.172 --> 02:00:00.654]  I do intend, a lot of days this week, to open the phones up.
[02:00:00.794 --> 02:00:02.055]  I've been doing a better job about that.
[02:00:02.636 --> 02:00:04.057]  Been a lot of other big guests throughout the week.
[02:00:04.917 --> 02:00:06.238]  Coming up, I haven't gotten to this yet.
[02:00:07.279 --> 02:00:11.182]  South African president vows to accelerate land expropriation from whites.
[02:00:11.682 --> 02:00:15.545]  Just a year ago, Media Matters said I was a conspiracy theorist, that this didn't exist.
[02:00:17.335 --> 02:00:21.898]  We also have, Macron says the epicenter of French language is now Africa.
[02:00:23.979 --> 02:00:25.980]  We've got so much more coming up on that front.
[02:00:26.821 --> 02:00:37.827]  But this Saudi Arabia deal is a big deal because it's meant to derail Trump's plan to secure the Middle East so it doesn't collapse into Europe and then into the United States and other countries.
[02:00:38.448 --> 02:00:40.629]  It's a major globalist destabilization program.
[02:00:40.649 --> 02:00:41.850]  We're going to be covering that.
[02:00:44.944 --> 02:00:47.146]  I want viewers and listeners to know something.
[02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:56.032]  When I say to you, without your support, without your prayers, without you spreading the word, we will be shut down.
[02:00:58.134 --> 02:01:03.878]  That's not an afterthought, that is the central core and fact to everything we do here.
[02:01:04.759 --> 02:01:09.443]  So, every accomplishment you see Infowars make, every success against globalism,
[02:01:10.316 --> 02:01:23.983]  Every pro-human development that takes place, every defense of Christian values that you see being secured from this nation's sovereignty to the right to self-defense is because of you.
[02:01:24.603 --> 02:01:25.643]  Yes, it's because of me.
[02:01:25.683 --> 02:01:26.544]  It's because of the crew.
[02:01:26.884 --> 02:01:35.108]  But without you, just like different parts of the body, working in concert together, we will be defeated.
[02:01:36.669 --> 02:01:39.350]  And so, first off, I want to thank all the viewers and listeners.
[02:01:40.649 --> 02:01:46.173]  And our affiliates and everyone else and the crew for standing with us during these incredibly historic times.
[02:01:47.734 --> 02:01:53.319]  Where my greatest frustration is that I do not have more to give for my country and my family and God.
[02:01:53.799 --> 02:01:56.761]  Because by giving and standing up, you build a great world.
[02:01:57.121 --> 02:01:59.263]  By laying down, you build a living hell!
[02:02:00.344 --> 02:02:05.968]  It's not some selfishness that drives what I'm doing.
[02:02:07.029 --> 02:02:09.751]  But at the same time, it's not some selflessness.
[02:02:12.031 --> 02:02:17.977]  See, selfish people think you shove everybody out around you and you get ahead, but then you create a toxic world in which you live.
[02:02:18.377 --> 02:02:18.877]  That's a hell.
[02:02:18.898 --> 02:02:24.923]  And then you've got a lot of selfless people that get conned into serving the globalists and giving up control over their own lives.
[02:02:25.704 --> 02:02:28.987]  What I'm doing is not selfless, and it's not selfish.
[02:02:30.789 --> 02:02:31.589]  It's common sense.
[02:02:32.836 --> 02:02:33.997]  It's about survival.
[02:02:34.177 --> 02:02:36.239]  It's about self-preservation.
[02:02:36.699 --> 02:02:42.845]  And if I'm going to preserve myself and my progeny, my children, I want to preserve you into the future as well.
[02:02:44.486 --> 02:02:45.267]  I believe in you.
[02:02:47.529 --> 02:02:56.437]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they've taken five payment processors we've got with mafia, bullying, racketeering tactics, and they're trying to take down our final ones right now.
[02:02:57.718 --> 02:02:59.420]  And that's why I've launched
[02:03:00.345 --> 02:03:04.466]  The biggest sale in our history, free shipping shore wide and 50% off all the supplements.
[02:03:04.906 --> 02:03:10.187]  We don't raise the price and then lower it and then say it's down 50% like other fake Black Friday specials.
[02:03:10.647 --> 02:03:11.147]  We don't do that.
[02:03:11.768 --> 02:03:15.028]  When we lower the price, it's lowered from the original real price.
[02:03:16.509 --> 02:03:22.490]  So we have Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, all of it rolled into one, right now until everything sells out.
[02:03:23.618 --> 02:03:28.021]  And until I fix these issues we're dealing with, I've stopped reordering products at this point.
[02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:30.803]  Because I'm not the type of guy to order stuff I can't pay for down the road.
[02:03:31.504 --> 02:03:33.365]  That's the level of the dire straits we're in.
[02:03:33.665 --> 02:03:35.207]  But I believe in you coming through.
[02:03:35.287 --> 02:03:36.848]  And the last few weeks, you've been doing it.
[02:03:38.462 --> 02:03:39.543]  Since I announced this issue.
[02:03:39.623 --> 02:03:40.583]  We're having record sales.
[02:03:41.123 --> 02:03:41.603]  But it's a catch-22.
[02:03:41.663 --> 02:03:44.125]  We're not making a lot of money on them because they're so low-priced.
[02:03:44.785 --> 02:03:46.086]  And we're selling out of our stock.
[02:03:46.146 --> 02:03:57.631]  But it's the only road, it's the right path, and it's what I'm doing to secure backup funds to go into the future while I'm having to sue people and having to have injunctions and take action to defeat these mafia organizations.
[02:03:57.991 --> 02:03:59.772]  And the President's gearing up to take action as well.
[02:04:00.052 --> 02:04:03.353]  I can tell you I spoke to folks connected to him very closely just a few days ago.
[02:04:03.594 --> 02:04:04.274]  So I'm very excited.
[02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:10.065]  That said, free shipping, 50% off, store-wide free shipping.
[02:04:11.126 --> 02:04:12.487]  Every product there will be sold.
[02:04:13.693 --> 02:04:16.994]  At 50% off until it sells out, or until we fix this problem.
[02:04:17.335 --> 02:04:19.595]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:04:19.635 --> 02:04:29.399]  Get great products to help you and your family, a 360 win, and help provision us into the future, at least a few months into the future, for InfoWars and our operations that are so critical to freedom.
[02:04:29.839 --> 02:04:33.061]  We've also got 35% off on incredibly high-quality, storable food as well.
[02:04:33.301 --> 02:04:36.202]  So take action there, and water filtration, Alexa Pure.
[02:04:42.964 --> 02:04:44.005]  Let's go to MAGA Titan.
[02:04:44.025 --> 02:04:45.626]  Sorry, I cut you short here, MAGA Titan.
[02:04:45.646 --> 02:04:46.587]  You got 60 seconds.
[02:04:46.627 --> 02:04:46.947]  Go ahead.
[02:04:47.007 --> 02:04:49.829]  There's a war for your mind and I just can't take it.
[02:04:49.869 --> 02:04:52.531]  Yelling at my phone, trying to break through this matrix.
[02:04:52.852 --> 02:04:55.454]  Thinking how to break through because we're all sedated.
[02:04:55.694 --> 02:04:56.995]  America is under attack.
[02:04:57.255 --> 02:04:58.036]  Can we debate it?
[02:04:58.576 --> 02:05:01.099]  They're trying to censor humanity's great awakening.
[02:05:01.119 --> 02:05:03.741]  The calm before the storm, we concede to the population.
[02:05:03.961 --> 02:05:05.923]  The mind control and the manipulation.
[02:05:06.043 --> 02:05:10.308]  They're lying to the TV of your favorite station just so they can get paid off the death of a nation.
[02:05:10.328 --> 02:05:12.910]  But this is the reverse and you heard it from Jones first.
[02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:15.513]  Feeling like Indiana Jones with a cold curse.
[02:05:16.113 --> 02:05:16.754]  That's MAGA Titan.
[02:05:16.774 --> 02:05:18.174]  I tell ya, if anyone deserves a bullhorn...
[02:05:48.687 --> 02:05:55.009]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:05:55.169 --> 02:06:09.274]  I just spoke with the King of Saudi Arabia, who denies any knowledge of what took place with regard to, as he said, his Saudi Arabian citizen.
[02:06:10.718 --> 02:06:29.211]  I've asked, and he firmly denied that, I've asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to immediately get on a plane, go to Saudi Arabia, go to other places if necessary, which he probably will, but with regard to this, go to Turkey if necessary.
[02:06:30.282 --> 02:06:39.631]  The King told me that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are working hand in hand very closely on getting to the bottom of what happened.
[02:06:40.712 --> 02:06:42.154]  So we'll see what happens.
[02:06:42.294 --> 02:06:49.361]  But Mike Pompeo, excuse me, Mike Pompeo is leaving literally within an hour or so.
[02:06:49.982 --> 02:06:51.623]  He's heading to Saudi Arabia.
[02:06:52.564 --> 02:06:53.085]  We are
[02:06:54.404 --> 02:06:56.205]  Going to leave nothing uncovered.
[02:06:56.245 --> 02:07:00.267]  With that being said, the King firmly denied any knowledge of it.
[02:07:01.548 --> 02:07:02.829]  He didn't really know.
[02:07:02.849 --> 02:07:10.793]  Maybe... I don't want to get into his mind, but it sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers.
[02:07:11.253 --> 02:07:11.773]  Who knows?
[02:07:12.273 --> 02:07:14.735]  We're gonna try getting to the bottom of it very soon.
[02:07:15.155 --> 02:07:16.696]  But his was a flat denial.
[02:07:25.472 --> 02:07:25.792]  All right.
[02:07:26.952 --> 02:07:28.373]  I have people on that I respect.
[02:07:28.533 --> 02:07:29.653]  Alex Jones here back live.
[02:07:30.353 --> 02:07:31.833]  Doesn't mean that I always agree with them.
[02:07:31.853 --> 02:07:32.853]  Doesn't mean I disagree with them.
[02:07:33.353 --> 02:07:46.856]  I talked to a lot of sources last week that said that they believed it was another element of the Saudi government that was going to kill this Khashoggi reporter because they then wanted to blame the crown prince and the king and the deal they've got with Trump.
[02:07:47.236 --> 02:07:52.177]  Try to derail it because Obama and Hillary and others are mad about the Iran deal and trouble.
[02:07:52.637 --> 02:07:53.399]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:59.972]  If Saudi Arabia is crazy enough in broad daylight at their embassy in Turkey to bring somebody in with an Apple Watch and then kill them...
[02:08:01.397 --> 02:08:08.338]  That sounds wild, but I said yesterday some people are saying it's a false flag or a staged event to destabilize the region again.
[02:08:08.698 --> 02:08:09.558]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:08:10.379 --> 02:08:15.779]  Dr. Steve Pucinich is one of the most accurate people we've had on over the years, and he predicted Trump's election here like we did.
[02:08:15.799 --> 02:08:30.422]  StevePucinich.com, he co-wrote a bunch of books and movies with Tom Clancy, was a composite character for Jack Ryan, he's a psychiatrist, been a military officer as well, worked in regime change, Camp David Accords, you name it, been in the CFR until he resigned.
[02:08:30.942 --> 02:08:37.847]  He exposed the whole fake Bin Laden fable about him being killed because he was dead a long time before and so much more.
[02:08:38.227 --> 02:08:39.468]  So he joins us now.
[02:08:39.648 --> 02:08:41.069]  I don't know his take on this yet.
[02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:43.691]  And it doesn't mean he disagrees with me.
[02:08:43.731 --> 02:08:44.231]  He's wrong.
[02:08:44.852 --> 02:08:46.813]  Because I'm not even saying I'm sure that's what's happening.
[02:08:46.933 --> 02:08:47.573]  I just know this.
[02:08:48.154 --> 02:08:49.455]  When you see mainstream media
[02:08:50.805 --> 02:09:02.433]  For a week, hyping it like it's the end of the world over to dead journalists, when Saudi Arabia's been bombing Yemen for years and killing tens of thousands and all this other crap, it just smells of Benghazi to me.
[02:09:02.453 --> 02:09:06.776]  Now maybe I'm wrong, we'll see what Steve Pachenik thinks, but I really respect his opinion.
[02:09:06.796 --> 02:09:10.179]  StevePachenik.com, again, exclusive King of Saudi Arabia.
[02:09:10.919 --> 02:09:14.780]  Well, honestly, I think your approach to this is the most honest and the most credible.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:18.302]  Number one, the fact that Khashoggi was a Washington Post reporter is irrelevant.
[02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:42.944]  Number two, everybody forgets that he really worked in Saudi intelligence and was very close to the whole royal family.
[02:09:43.024 --> 02:09:44.006]  So he's an operative.
[02:09:44.750 --> 02:09:49.432]  Whatever happened to him, quite frankly, is not relevant to our national security.
[02:09:49.612 --> 02:09:54.633]  We have interests, and Trump has said it repeatedly, and I'm going to say it again a hundred times.
[02:09:54.733 --> 02:09:55.874]  We do not have friends.
[02:09:56.254 --> 02:09:57.334]  We do not have enemies.
[02:09:57.394 --> 02:09:58.715]  We have national interests.
[02:09:58.835 --> 02:10:01.816]  Our national interest is to be with Saudi Arabia.
[02:10:01.916 --> 02:10:02.896]  It's our ally.
[02:10:03.216 --> 02:10:08.458]  We want that $110 billion of military equipment sold to them, period.
[02:10:08.878 --> 02:10:12.380]  In turn, Turkey will have its $200 million debt, billion-dollar debt,
[02:10:14.141 --> 02:10:15.083]  We're good to go.
[02:10:20.331 --> 02:10:26.274]  Eliminate that debt for Turkey, and in turn we will find out, quote, that there was a rogue element.
[02:10:26.674 --> 02:10:28.815]  Is it relevant to our national security?
[02:10:28.835 --> 02:10:28.875]  No.
[02:10:29.936 --> 02:10:30.976]  Absolutely, you're right.
[02:10:31.556 --> 02:10:33.177]  It is not the end of the world.
[02:10:33.357 --> 02:10:38.880]  It is not an ability, it's not an interest to destabilize the Middle East.
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:42.182]  The issue is very simply, what is in our interest?
[02:10:42.322 --> 02:10:46.944]  Our interest to maintain a friendship with Saudi Arabia, maintain a friendship with Turkey,
[02:10:47.464 --> 02:10:56.269]  And let's pull back now, though, and then see the clear hype, like babies in incubators or, you know, any hype we see before they do something like this, the more globalist elements of the deep state, I see
[02:11:07.356 --> 02:11:09.017]  Really trying to sabotage something.
[02:11:09.057 --> 02:11:13.261]  So what is the breathless CNN, MSNBC, ABC, New York Times?
[02:11:14.482 --> 02:11:15.442]  Trump's not doing enough.
[02:11:16.243 --> 02:11:17.604]  We need to do something in Saudi Arabia.
[02:11:17.884 --> 02:11:18.745]  What are they wanting?
[02:11:19.935 --> 02:11:23.979]  What they want is the attention that you've had for 17 years.
[02:11:24.039 --> 02:11:25.700]  Remember what we've talked about.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:26.721]  They're moribund.
[02:11:26.981 --> 02:11:29.083]  Most people are not watching CNN.
[02:11:29.103 --> 02:11:30.865]  They're not watching MSNBC.
[02:11:31.165 --> 02:11:32.847]  I don't even know what they are anymore.
[02:11:32.927 --> 02:11:35.089]  Quite frankly, they're not relevant.
[02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:39.593]  And what happened is this guy Alex Jones becomes more and more relevant.
[02:11:40.033 --> 02:11:42.495]  To the narrative that we have in the United States.
[02:11:42.575 --> 02:11:47.319]  So what happens is you have an editor of the New York Times, a nice guy, whatever.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:49.802]  He doesn't really know what to hide.
[02:11:49.962 --> 02:11:57.428]  So he goes from various personal stories in Mexico to a national disgrace in Turkey.
[02:11:57.488 --> 02:11:58.389]  He has no idea.
[02:11:59.550 --> 02:12:01.571]  The whole industry has no idea.
[02:12:01.631 --> 02:12:16.322]  What you're finding is the end of the entertainment industry, the media industry, the radio, the TV, and what's happening is this Alex Jones Show broke the whole model of saying, okay, can we do entertainment?
[02:12:16.382 --> 02:12:16.642]  Yes.
[02:12:17.042 --> 02:12:18.864]  Can we do a narrative that's serious?
[02:12:18.964 --> 02:12:19.284]  Yes.
[02:12:19.424 --> 02:12:22.686]  Can we do a paradigm shift that people can believe in?
[02:12:22.787 --> 02:12:23.067]  Yes.
[02:12:23.647 --> 02:12:24.267]  What happened?
[02:12:24.487 --> 02:12:25.988]  You left everybody in the trail.
[02:12:26.108 --> 02:12:27.108]  I'm not lauding you.
[02:12:27.208 --> 02:12:34.710]  I'm simply saying that what they need to do and the only recourse they have is either to keep silent or open their mouth.
[02:12:35.130 --> 02:12:45.172]  If you go back in history and you look at all of the individuals who were interviewed about whether Trump will become President of the United States, there isn't one person
[02:12:45.892 --> 02:12:53.754]  Either in the Senate or anywhere else who agreed that Trump will be President of the United States other than you, me, and the rest of our colleagues.
[02:12:54.274 --> 02:12:55.275]  They were ashamed.
[02:12:55.495 --> 02:12:56.635]  CNN was ashamed.
[02:12:56.895 --> 02:12:57.855]  MSNBC.
[02:12:58.275 --> 02:12:59.516]  They had poll after poll.
[02:12:59.536 --> 02:13:02.616]  And is that why they're so enraged and now the economy's coming back?
[02:13:03.037 --> 02:13:08.358]  And it makes them look like the incompetence that you've been saying on my show for 18 years they are.
[02:13:09.093 --> 02:13:10.534]  They are incompetent.
[02:13:10.695 --> 02:13:13.417]  I can't even explain how incompetent they are.
[02:13:13.557 --> 02:13:17.961]  Believe me, when I was in the national security area, they would call me up.
[02:13:18.262 --> 02:13:20.123]  They were sycophants, basically.
[02:13:20.504 --> 02:13:21.765]  What does a journalist do?
[02:13:22.145 --> 02:13:25.008]  A journalist is a- Well, I've noticed, if I don't like somebody, I tell them I don't like them.
[02:13:25.048 --> 02:13:25.448]  So do you.
[02:13:25.689 --> 02:13:31.995]  They all, on purpose, talk crap about everybody constantly, and do no work, and then they're always trying to social climb.
[02:13:32.835 --> 02:13:33.455]  That's sick.
[02:13:33.535 --> 02:13:34.576]  That's exactly right.
[02:13:34.676 --> 02:13:40.057]  So when you get on the air and you say something, we don't have to kowtow to each other.
[02:13:40.097 --> 02:13:40.717]  We don't need to.
[02:13:40.757 --> 02:13:42.038]  We respect each other.
[02:13:42.078 --> 02:13:43.258]  We care about what we say.
[02:13:43.678 --> 02:13:46.279]  But you never, never scream me before.
[02:13:46.839 --> 02:13:48.520]  It's the reverse in the newspapers.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:49.780]  They'll ask you, well, what do you think?
[02:13:50.080 --> 02:13:50.860]  What show do you think?
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:54.361]  When I was on NNBC or ABC or whatever, it didn't matter.
[02:13:54.661 --> 02:14:00.343]  They would always want to know where your position is because they didn't know how to create a spontaneous show.
[02:14:00.743 --> 02:14:03.926]  What you're seeing now is the end of this industry.
[02:14:04.366 --> 02:14:05.227]  Wolf Blitzer.
[02:14:05.347 --> 02:14:07.108]  Oh, there was no way Trump was coming in.
[02:14:07.148 --> 02:14:10.130]  We have these 16 studies that were done and it's clear.
[02:14:10.591 --> 02:14:10.851]  Boom.
[02:14:10.991 --> 02:14:11.471]  Wrong.
[02:14:11.491 --> 02:14:14.634]  So it's the total end of their credibility.
[02:14:14.694 --> 02:14:16.555]  It's the total end of them running their hoaxes.
[02:14:16.915 --> 02:14:20.178]  And so instead of stopping lying, they could have maybe saved themselves.
[02:14:20.218 --> 02:14:24.361]  They quadrupled the lying and have now gone into insane asylum land.
[02:14:24.661 --> 02:14:27.143]  As a psychiatrist, where do you think they go next?
[02:14:28.001 --> 02:14:29.342]  Well, it's very simple.
[02:14:29.382 --> 02:14:30.342]  They're not insane.
[02:14:30.382 --> 02:14:32.343]  They're just stupid and incompetent.
[02:14:32.643 --> 02:14:34.704]  Insanity doesn't even come into this.
[02:14:34.784 --> 02:14:38.165]  When you're incompetent and you're basically ignorant.
[02:14:38.405 --> 02:14:41.066]  Maggie Haberman, New York Times.
[02:14:41.146 --> 02:14:41.726]  Why is she there?
[02:14:41.766 --> 02:14:42.827]  Her father was there.
[02:14:43.207 --> 02:14:44.567]  New York Times reporters.
[02:14:44.647 --> 02:14:45.888]  They don't really know.
[02:14:45.968 --> 02:14:46.848]  They think they know.
[02:14:46.908 --> 02:14:48.349]  They hang around the people.
[02:14:48.769 --> 02:14:49.789]  They're sycophants.
[02:14:49.829 --> 02:14:51.610]  They manipulate your sources.
[02:14:51.670 --> 02:14:53.671]  And then they have, oh, well, we have deep sources.
[02:14:54.171 --> 02:14:56.374]  Look at the example of what happened in the New York Times.
[02:14:56.434 --> 02:14:58.917]  You had a revolution supposedly in the New York Times.
[02:14:58.937 --> 02:15:00.539]  Well, I haven't seen anybody thrown out.
[02:15:00.979 --> 02:15:03.622]  Were they co-opted by the President of the United States?
[02:15:03.983 --> 02:15:05.665]  I think they may have been co-opted.
[02:15:06.205 --> 02:15:11.592]  I think that in turn, Trump made a fool out of the New York Times when they had that piece in there.
[02:15:11.972 --> 02:15:22.375]  So what's happening is, you want to play with Trump, then you better understand 40 or 50 years of a very shrewd businessman who only thinks about one thing.
[02:15:22.635 --> 02:15:28.197]  What's in my interest, or the interest of my country, and what is in the interest of the other.
[02:15:28.277 --> 02:15:34.979]  And having him, somebody like that, working for our interests has got what has these people who have been selling us out so scared.
[02:15:35.019 --> 02:15:35.519]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:43.450 --> 02:15:44.030]  Did you hear?
[02:15:44.411 --> 02:15:45.872]  Christmas is coming in October.
[02:15:46.252 --> 02:15:47.873]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[02:15:48.414 --> 02:15:49.995]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[02:15:50.015 --> 02:15:52.917]  But what's really coming in October is incredible deals.
[02:15:52.937 --> 02:15:56.880]  50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[02:15:57.601 --> 02:16:04.766]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[02:16:05.446 --> 02:16:10.150]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo burn.
[02:16:11.325 --> 02:16:12.266]  By the way, the dinosaurs.
[02:16:12.486 --> 02:16:14.807]  Because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[02:16:16.068 --> 02:16:19.751]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us.
[02:16:19.771 --> 02:16:24.534]  And you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away.
[02:16:24.554 --> 02:16:25.795]  So we can't even process orders.
[02:16:26.476 --> 02:16:31.259]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[02:16:31.319 --> 02:16:36.403]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[02:16:38.064 --> 02:16:51.421]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[02:16:51.981 --> 02:16:56.126]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[02:16:57.293 --> 02:17:02.675]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[02:17:03.075 --> 02:17:04.195]  Black Friday's coming early.
[02:17:05.055 --> 02:17:06.156]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[02:17:06.376 --> 02:17:12.338]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[02:17:12.918 --> 02:17:18.299]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[02:17:19.160 --> 02:17:26.542]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[02:17:27.550 --> 02:17:29.502]  M4 Wars is in your hands.
[02:17:30.856 --> 02:17:32.757]  InfoWars has always been in your hands.
[02:17:32.897 --> 02:17:36.218]  And we were the number one media organization in the world.
[02:17:36.398 --> 02:17:38.959]  After Grudge Report, we went ahead and did video and audio.
[02:17:39.019 --> 02:17:40.820]  Number one in the election of Trump.
[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:42.760]  And so they shadow banned us.
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:44.161]  And they took our sponsors.
[02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:45.221]  They wouldn't let us advertise.
[02:17:45.281 --> 02:17:45.901]  And they strangled us.
[02:17:46.461 --> 02:17:49.623]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[02:17:50.263 --> 02:17:52.063]  And so now they're coming after our ability.
[02:17:52.364 --> 02:17:55.225]  InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[02:17:55.265 --> 02:17:55.845]  But we've got it.
[02:17:55.865 --> 02:17:56.565]  We've got backups.
[02:17:56.985 --> 02:17:58.506]  But they're like a mafia targeting those.
[02:17:59.526 --> 02:18:00.707]  Get your X2.
[02:18:00.927 --> 02:18:03.728]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[02:18:04.108 --> 02:18:05.928]  Rainforest, selling out, 50% off.
[02:18:06.309 --> 02:18:07.769]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:10.090]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[02:18:10.130 --> 02:18:12.491]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:16.292]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[02:18:16.532 --> 02:18:20.734]  And, free shipping, store-wide, mformorestore.com.
[02:18:21.034 --> 02:18:23.575]  So, this is the October
[02:18:25.131 --> 02:18:26.532]  Black Friday coming early.
[02:18:26.932 --> 02:18:28.113]  This is Christmas coming early.
[02:18:28.493 --> 02:18:30.054]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[02:18:30.174 --> 02:18:32.216]  This is Christmas in October.
[02:18:32.816 --> 02:18:35.858]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[02:18:35.958 --> 02:18:36.798]  The five-star ratings.
[02:18:37.299 --> 02:18:38.800]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts.
[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:40.361]  So that you have them.
[02:18:40.501 --> 02:18:41.782]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[02:18:41.802 --> 02:18:43.002]  Christmas is only two months away.
[02:18:43.803 --> 02:18:46.404]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products to win-win.
[02:18:46.665 --> 02:18:47.505]  I'm counting on you.
[02:18:47.525 --> 02:18:48.446]  You've always come through.
[02:18:48.466 --> 02:18:50.047]  They know you always come through.
[02:18:50.347 --> 02:18:53.349]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[02:18:54.009 --> 02:18:58.732]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[02:18:58.752 --> 02:19:01.654]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[02:19:01.734 --> 02:19:02.435]  Nobody's got that.
[02:19:03.175 --> 02:19:04.056]  Credit card processing.
[02:19:04.456 --> 02:19:06.497]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[02:19:06.757 --> 02:19:07.338]  We expose them.
[02:19:07.518 --> 02:19:11.460]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.

[02:19:28.518 --> 02:19:29.399]  I'm counting on you.
[02:19:29.679 --> 02:19:30.580]  You always come through.
[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:31.660]  Take advantage of this.
[02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:33.862]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[02:19:42.256 --> 02:19:45.157]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:19:45.678 --> 02:19:53.582]  You know, I've said this a lot.
[02:20:11.761 --> 02:20:13.342]  Dr. Steve was saying this like 10 years ago.
[02:20:13.982 --> 02:20:23.126]  Understanding the InfoWars model of us self-funding with our listeners and being on every platform we can and not being centralized really worries the globalists.
[02:20:23.186 --> 02:20:24.446]  It's not about tooting my horn.
[02:20:24.946 --> 02:20:25.807]  We all know that
[02:20:27.481 --> 02:20:35.304]  Big Tech, Silicon Valley, all of it is extremely threatened by InfoWars just because of how small it is, but how big its footprint is.
[02:20:35.324 --> 02:20:42.087]  Because Dr. Steve Pachinick wrote NetForce with Tom Clancy and has worked in cybersecurity, and he knows a lot of the big brains that are involved.
[02:20:42.667 --> 02:20:48.390]  And he obviously pointed out that Google was really founded by DARPA and the Geospatial Center 20 years ago and the rest of it.
[02:20:49.170 --> 02:20:50.491]  Earlier, I covered this.
[02:20:51.651 --> 02:20:59.315]  And I sat there a month ago in congressional hearings where Senator Cotton and Senator Rubio were the only ones that brought up real questions.
[02:20:59.335 --> 02:21:01.796]  That's why the media cuts off the front of Rubio.
[02:21:01.836 --> 02:21:06.058]  I walk up politely at the press conference area and he says, get away from me, I don't know who you are.
[02:21:07.018 --> 02:21:09.380]  And then I start saying, hey, just answer my question about U.S.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:12.201]  citizens being censored, not just what's happening in China.
[02:21:12.641 --> 02:21:13.522]  And so he was a jerk.
[02:21:13.542 --> 02:21:14.762]  That's why I started being a jerk back.
[02:21:14.802 --> 02:21:20.005]  I probably shouldn't have been a jerk to him just because, you know, he got spun by the media, but I was being real.
[02:21:21.519 --> 02:21:29.867]  We've talked about this 10, 12 years ago, how China was putting spy chips in ships that went back to the U.S.
[02:21:30.307 --> 02:21:33.870]  to then spy on the Pentagon, spy on companies, spy on everybody.
[02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:37.613]  Now it's in Bloomberg, or Google's CEO tells senators
[02:21:38.354 --> 02:21:48.240]  That censored Chinese search engine could provide broad benefits, and this is Google CEO Sundar Pichai, has refused to answer a list of questions from U.S.
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:51.582]  lawmakers about the company's secret plan for a censored search engine in China.
[02:21:51.823 --> 02:22:02.910]  I'm here to tell you, they've already deployed a dragonfly type system that tracks your identity, and then puts you in an algorithm of what your psychology type is, or what your profile is.
[02:22:03.885 --> 02:22:15.375]  And then it admits that the head of Google contradicts the head of global privacy, who just testified two weeks ago and said, there is no dragonfly, we're not spying on anybody, all of this.
[02:22:15.395 --> 02:22:25.684]  So I see the capitulation of Google and Apple, or more like in the case of Apple, they're just marrying the communist Chinese to get the tax exemption.
[02:22:25.704 --> 02:22:28.066]  Trump goes from 40 to 15, the left says, how dare you?
[02:22:28.447 --> 02:22:29.487]  Well, he was just matching China.
[02:22:30.308 --> 02:22:34.431]  And then China goes to zero, but you've got to be state-run, and then six months ago it's in Royers.
[02:22:35.831 --> 02:22:41.335]  The code keys to the Apple iCloud and your iPhone IDs are given to China.
[02:22:41.375 --> 02:22:44.697]  Well, China fences that out and then steals data with hackers.
[02:22:44.917 --> 02:22:45.918]  They're worse than the Russians.
[02:22:45.978 --> 02:22:57.885]  So, it's not that our government's perfect, and I'm against the Big Brother thing, but the only thing worse is to then give them everything and then work against the Pentagon and America, and as bad as Bezos is,
[02:22:59.392 --> 02:23:04.889]  If you study the Jedi program and all the stuff I've got here, it's actually building a 10 billion dollar AI system.
[02:23:06.007 --> 02:23:19.173]  With the Pentagon, to actually project free market and other things, but it's the only cyber company, and believe me, Amazon's a cyber company, not just shipping, that would work with the Pentagon in this $10 million program.
[02:23:19.193 --> 02:23:26.275]  So as much as I don't like Bezos and some of the things he's done, it's the only big tech company I see that's even doing anything.
[02:23:26.315 --> 02:23:31.798]  So the level of treason, and I see this as World War IV, with the collaborators,
[02:23:32.518 --> 02:23:44.568]  And the globalists and the CFR that thought there'd be a Chinese century, and here comes Trump pissing in the Cheerios, right at the last moment, everyone should be literally in the streets supporting the president, because at least he's an American president.
[02:23:45.028 --> 02:23:48.751]  And I don't understand how Google and others would bet on China with all of its problems.
[02:23:49.232 --> 02:23:51.234]  It's beyond fiction.
[02:23:51.274 --> 02:23:53.896]  As they say, truth is stranger than fiction, Dr. Pucinich.
[02:23:54.436 --> 02:23:56.278]  And you look at this, and I'm serious.
[02:23:56.858 --> 02:23:57.879]  I'm an anti-fascist.
[02:23:57.979 --> 02:23:58.900]  I don't like tyranny.
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:23:59.740]  I don't like police states.
[02:24:00.421 --> 02:24:06.245]  I'm under a Google, Apple, Twitter, Facebook, big tech censorship with the stay-behind-Democrat networks.
[02:24:06.706 --> 02:24:07.826]  They're trying to destroy me.
[02:24:08.507 --> 02:24:09.968]  The Chai Koms own Hollywood.
[02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.329]  They're trying to oppress everything.
[02:24:11.789 --> 02:24:12.570]  And I'm serious.
[02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:16.853]  If the President marched the Marine Corps into these offices, which would hurt the economy, we shouldn't do it.
[02:24:16.873 --> 02:24:17.354]  But I'm sorry.
[02:24:17.734 --> 02:24:20.656]  If they arrested the heads of all these companies, we have the damn evidence.
[02:24:20.696 --> 02:24:21.917]  I mean, we built this.
[02:24:22.037 --> 02:24:22.598]  It's ours.
[02:24:22.898 --> 02:24:25.380]  They're allied with a group that killed five times what Hitler did.
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:29.523]  They're raping American citizens in mass, trying to leverage an authoritarianism.
[02:24:30.204 --> 02:24:36.769]  A year and a half ago at Davos, their dictator showed up, the Chinese dictator, and said, I'll defeat Trump and America.
[02:24:36.989 --> 02:24:37.530]  They're weak.
[02:24:37.610 --> 02:24:40.152]  And Juncker said, yeah, we'll crush America.
[02:24:40.172 --> 02:24:41.613]  I mean, these are the damn quotes.
[02:24:41.853 --> 02:24:45.957]  They're just asking, politically and economically, to have their goddamn teeth knocked out.
[02:24:47.236 --> 02:24:52.220]  Well, let me be very straightforward with you.
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:55.622]  President Xi is in major, major trouble.
[02:24:56.223 --> 02:25:08.852]  Even the New York Post congratulated Trump on being the true student of Sun Tzu, meaning Trump has just gotten into Xi's mentality, into the entire Communist Party,
[02:25:09.472 --> 02:25:32.611]  And he's playing with him to such an extent, this is the sixth month in a row, and thanks to your show on Owen Schroeder and Harrison Jones, I was explaining how every month, Xi, who has no idea of how to run the economy in China or any other economy, is pumping in a hundred billion dollars in liquidity, which means in effect China is bankrupt.
[02:25:33.051 --> 02:25:33.892]  She knows that.
[02:25:34.332 --> 02:25:35.013]  I know that.
[02:25:35.153 --> 02:25:36.234]  Trump knows that.
[02:25:36.674 --> 02:25:47.722]  And what's happening is the one belt, one road effort that he put out there is not working because country after country is defaulting on the loans.
[02:25:48.302 --> 02:25:55.928]  She cannot handle the underlying suppression within his own community, the district.
[02:25:56.088 --> 02:25:59.831]  And so him becoming a dictator six months ago officially was a sign of weakness?
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:01.422]  Well, that's correct.
[02:26:01.462 --> 02:26:10.120]  I mean, from the very day he became a dictator and said, I'm a Maoist, I said a year ago on your show, this man has to be very stupid.
[02:26:10.201 --> 02:26:11.082]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:26:11.818 --> 02:26:16.984]  He and his father were tortured by the Cultural Revolution by Mao Zedong himself.
[02:26:17.444 --> 02:26:20.467]  I'm not talking about just simple words.
[02:26:20.487 --> 02:26:22.229]  Xi was beaten up repeatedly.
[02:26:22.450 --> 02:26:24.352]  And what was the conclusion he came to?
[02:26:24.372 --> 02:26:26.334]  Oh, I'm going to be like Mao.
[02:26:26.594 --> 02:26:33.802]  Instead of understanding that the true genius of China was Deng Xiaoping, who said, cover your strength,
[02:26:34.202 --> 02:26:41.287]  By your time, Mao decided to go out and kill all the millions of these people and she took that model.
[02:26:41.747 --> 02:26:45.110]  Now what's happening is he's got revolution in China.
[02:26:45.470 --> 02:26:46.531]  He's got revolution.
[02:26:47.051 --> 02:26:50.894]  He literally has arrested the Chinese head of Interpol.
[02:26:51.594 --> 02:26:55.596]  The chief of Interpol happens to be Chinese and he's in prison.
[02:26:55.997 --> 02:26:59.058]  That's how bold and ignorant Xi is.
[02:26:59.458 --> 02:27:03.501]  And he's dependent on a bunch of old men on the Communist Party.
[02:27:03.821 --> 02:27:11.125]  And I'm predicting that the People's Liberation Army, which is younger, and looking around and say, geez, you know, Xi was never in our military.
[02:27:11.505 --> 02:27:13.566]  They're going to say this is not good for us.
[02:27:13.686 --> 02:27:14.827]  Meanwhile, Trump is
[02:27:15.663 --> 02:27:16.684]  Tacking him down.
[02:27:16.704 --> 02:27:18.785]  He can't do anything right now.
[02:27:19.365 --> 02:27:23.808]  Whether Google continues or not, that's up to the national team.
[02:27:23.868 --> 02:27:24.529]  And I cut you off.
[02:27:24.549 --> 02:27:25.709]  I'll give you the floor next segment.
[02:27:26.710 --> 02:27:28.571]  And I want to get into China and its witnesses, and I agree.
[02:27:29.052 --> 02:27:37.457]  Why is the Hollywood elite and the left running to him like he's this wonderful person and calling Trump a dictator and a Nazi when they're literally cozied up to a mass murderer?
[02:27:38.345 --> 02:27:40.667]  Because they're ignorant, my friend.
[02:27:40.848 --> 02:27:42.269]  I've worked in Hollywood.
[02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:44.331]  They have no basic education.
[02:27:44.632 --> 02:27:45.453]  They're actors.
[02:27:45.813 --> 02:27:47.014]  They're TV writers.
[02:27:47.074 --> 02:27:48.836]  They're in a make-believe world.
[02:27:49.196 --> 02:27:53.301]  That make-believe world has all kinds of constructs that are not real.
[02:27:53.781 --> 02:28:06.648]  So they assume if they can use their hundreds of millions for which they're guilty because you stand up and you say a bunch of absurd words for a few minutes and you're in a movie and you're a movie star, that's not really a job.
[02:28:06.928 --> 02:28:07.689]  They know that.
[02:28:08.049 --> 02:28:08.749]  I know that.
[02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:10.911]  That's why I left the industry.
[02:28:11.031 --> 02:28:13.052]  Basically, the industry is a joke.
[02:28:13.252 --> 02:28:14.392]  I'm a member of the producers.
[02:28:14.452 --> 02:28:15.073]  No, no, I agree.
[02:28:15.393 --> 02:28:16.534]  But the narrative's the truth.
[02:28:16.874 --> 02:28:20.376]  And even if they don't know they're complete traitors, we point out they're traitors at Shycom.
[02:28:20.396 --> 02:28:21.676]  They're weak-minded, period.
[02:28:22.697 --> 02:28:24.318]  I think the Democratic Party is permanently done.
[02:28:24.879 --> 02:28:25.739]  They're too dangerous.
[02:28:25.759 --> 02:28:26.700]  They're too out of control.
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:29.602]  They hate America so much they've cozied up the Communist Chinese.
[02:28:30.002 --> 02:28:31.423]  What do we do about it when we come back?
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:41.200]  Joining us is Michael Graves.
[02:28:41.460 --> 02:28:44.421]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it.
[02:28:44.501 --> 02:28:45.341]  This is big news.
[02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:49.382]  Former Misfits singer, appearance canceled after social media review.
[02:28:49.562 --> 02:28:50.343]  Michael Graves.
[02:28:50.703 --> 02:28:56.184]  And this is a big deal, because they said, we reviewed him, and it's white supremacy and all this made-up crap.
[02:28:56.264 --> 02:28:59.565]  And so he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[02:28:59.645 --> 02:29:00.645]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[02:29:00.665 --> 02:29:02.546]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[02:29:02.766 --> 02:29:05.106]  Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[02:29:05.126 --> 02:29:07.487]  My tour manager is also my guitar player.
[02:29:08.348 --> 02:29:31.031]  And I we had a day off and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened After the festival had posted it That they had like you've said reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson from Info Wars from Breitbart
[02:29:31.948 --> 02:29:33.229]  Um, on and on.
[02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:41.239]  And it really is a sign of the times, Alex, because about 10 years ago, I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[02:29:41.259 --> 02:29:43.082]  It was called the War of Information Tour.
[02:29:44.069 --> 02:30:02.994]  And me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers that other patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from ordering through InfoWars, and we were disseminating the information and getting the word out, and no one said, boo.
[02:30:03.434 --> 02:30:06.595]  No one cared that what we were doing.
[02:30:07.175 --> 02:30:09.976]  Now, jump to where we are in 2018, and
[02:30:14.477 --> 02:30:18.202]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[02:30:18.802 --> 02:30:25.470]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[02:30:25.570 --> 02:30:31.297]  And like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people.
[02:30:31.838 --> 02:30:34.481]  And we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that.
[02:30:34.961 --> 02:30:49.072]  You and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression, to hit the barbed wire as well.
[02:30:49.172 --> 02:30:57.118]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there, there's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists.
[02:30:57.838 --> 02:31:08.368]  And the attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover.
[02:31:09.935 --> 02:31:15.679]  For other artists, other musicians to do this regardless of the consequences.
[02:31:15.939 --> 02:31:22.544]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[02:31:22.644 --> 02:31:28.608]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man and we really appreciate you and I look forward to having you back on.
[02:31:29.469 --> 02:31:30.049]  Alex, thank you.
[02:31:30.129 --> 02:31:34.472]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[02:31:34.853 --> 02:31:35.633]  Alex, thank you.
[02:31:35.813 --> 02:31:36.113]  Thank you.
[02:31:36.134 --> 02:31:36.674]  God bless you.
[02:31:39.051 --> 02:31:42.052]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[02:31:42.112 --> 02:31:42.592]  Go ahead.
[02:31:42.832 --> 02:31:48.393]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[02:31:48.613 --> 02:31:49.713]  I'd done The War Room.
[02:31:50.013 --> 02:31:52.454]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[02:31:52.474 --> 02:31:54.034]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[02:31:54.074 --> 02:31:54.774]  I was exhausted.
[02:31:55.014 --> 02:31:58.295]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[02:31:58.635 --> 02:32:03.276]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[02:32:03.356 --> 02:32:05.296]  Tonight I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[02:32:05.756 --> 02:32:06.217]  Same thing.
[02:32:06.297 --> 02:32:08.198]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[02:32:08.298 --> 02:32:09.539]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[02:32:09.679 --> 02:32:11.540]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:17.804]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[02:32:18.105 --> 02:32:18.865]  You can sleep with it.
[02:32:19.225 --> 02:32:23.568]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:32:23.608 --> 02:32:26.410]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.271]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:32:28.391 --> 02:32:29.092]  It really works.
[02:32:29.312 --> 02:32:33.915]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[02:32:34.275 --> 02:32:35.316]  I wasted a lot of money on this.
[02:32:35.376 --> 02:32:37.618]  Old boots, believe me.
[02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:44.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:59.614 --> 02:33:05.997]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:13.439 --> 02:33:23.022]  We're going to get into the real geopolitical players here in a moment with Dr. Steve Pachinik, and then we will continue on to talk about what he sees going into the midterms, what some of the real threats to the restoration of our republic are.
[02:33:23.042 --> 02:33:34.465]  But you can see that the globalists and other interests were sycophantically selling off industry, selling off intellectual property, so they could just make a quick buck, and then calling themselves geniuses.
[02:33:34.485 --> 02:33:36.326]  We're going to be talking about that in a moment.
[02:33:37.202 --> 02:33:52.967]  Please don't forget that as successful as you've been and as I've been at educating people and as our guests have been, and I'm talking to the audience because you really are the heart of this operation, Soros and Hillary and the rest of them are trying to destroy InfoWars to punish us for what happened in 2016.
[02:33:54.287 --> 02:33:58.909]  And they have put us through the wringer and in some ways we've become stronger and in some ways weaker.
[02:33:59.906 --> 02:34:02.467]  But they are trying to take our payment processors.
[02:34:02.487 --> 02:34:04.088]  They've taken five of the six.
[02:34:04.628 --> 02:34:05.429]  I've got a backup.
[02:34:05.709 --> 02:34:06.269]  That's Intel.
[02:34:06.289 --> 02:34:06.929]  I'll just give them.
[02:34:07.510 --> 02:34:08.750]  And I'll give them this Intel, too.
[02:34:08.850 --> 02:34:10.311]  The big law firms preparing lawsuits.
[02:34:10.711 --> 02:34:15.013]  You guys have been involved in tortious interference, racketeering, you know, you name it, against InfoWars.
[02:34:15.073 --> 02:34:19.495]  But now they're harassing whoever we have as payment processors.
[02:34:19.535 --> 02:34:22.056]  So your order comes through, it gets shipped to you.
[02:34:22.216 --> 02:34:23.457]  They could shut it down any time.
[02:34:23.857 --> 02:34:25.038]  That's why we're having Christmas.
[02:34:26.431 --> 02:34:36.038]  Black Friday and Cyber Monday, all the sales we had planned, all the inventory we had planned to sell at sales at those points, all rolled into one.
[02:34:36.078 --> 02:34:38.781]  So Christmas, Black Friday, Cyber Monday are all happening now.
[02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:40.702]  I'm selling X2 until it sells out.
[02:34:40.802 --> 02:34:41.483]  It's the last run.
[02:34:41.503 --> 02:34:42.043]  People love it.
[02:34:42.083 --> 02:34:42.684]  The good halogen.
[02:34:43.064 --> 02:34:44.505]  Brain Force until it sells out.
[02:34:44.545 --> 02:34:45.286]  The great nootropic.
[02:34:45.686 --> 02:34:49.088]  The bodies, the ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcuminoids.
[02:34:49.409 --> 02:34:52.091]  Nobody else has got that for anti-inflammatory, you name it.
[02:34:52.411 --> 02:34:52.911]  It's incredible.
[02:34:53.352 --> 02:34:56.014]  Every supplement, 50% off and free shipping.
[02:34:57.506 --> 02:35:05.973]  Biggest sale ever on everything, like fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified toothpaste, mouthwash, immune gargle, super blue, it's all 50% off.
[02:35:06.374 --> 02:35:10.617]  And we don't raise prices and then lower prices like some people do, and then call it a sale.
[02:35:10.958 --> 02:35:13.059]  It's a real sale, biggest sale ever.
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:19.685]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, get your orders in, okay?
[02:35:20.145 --> 02:35:23.007]  Because they are coming down on us like a ton of bricks.
[02:35:23.067 --> 02:35:32.474]  They have millions of people in these leftist armies coming after us, and it's a testament to the success we've had, but we need to fund ourselves in the future.
[02:35:32.534 --> 02:35:37.758]  So get your Christmas shopping done now, get it done early, don't fight traffic, and know you provisioned us into the new year.
[02:35:38.539 --> 02:35:39.800]  We're trying to sell everything.
[02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:41.200]  Everything must go right now.
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:43.801]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:43.841 --> 02:35:46.102]  The high quality storable food.
[02:35:46.382 --> 02:35:48.683]  Best in the country for the price.
[02:35:48.703 --> 02:35:48.943]  35% off.
[02:35:49.383 --> 02:35:51.524]  Infowars Select and MyPatriotsSupplyFood.
[02:35:51.804 --> 02:35:53.705]  Their Alexa Pure Breeze is discounted.
[02:35:54.185 --> 02:35:55.426]  Their Alexa Pure Water Filters.
[02:35:55.566 --> 02:35:59.567]  Everything's discounted at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:36:00.828 --> 02:36:04.089]  So get those orders in because we're under globalist attack.
[02:36:04.109 --> 02:36:06.410]  They're trying to cut off our supply lines.
[02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:07.090]  Thank you very much.
[02:36:20.106 --> 02:36:29.511]  Soon as the Skype comes back up, the devil's always in the details, about the UN, and the globalists, and the chi-coms, and the things they're trying, the things they're doing.
[02:36:29.551 --> 02:36:32.953]  Because, you know, there's so many of these issues I haven't even got into.
[02:36:32.973 --> 02:36:38.276]  But I'm trying from your perspective, and the high-level sources you have, about who the players are.
[02:36:39.216 --> 02:36:42.338]  And why Silicon Valley would want to cozy up to China?
[02:36:42.658 --> 02:36:48.883]  I know you say they're a bunch of idiots, they're out of control, they're virtue signalers, but I think it's because in China they're allowed to do whatever they want.
[02:36:49.183 --> 02:36:54.607]  They've made that decision with the globalists, I think because Trump just wants to create free market freedom.
[02:36:55.047 --> 02:36:59.310]  Behind the scenes he isn't threatening people like China, like the Democrats are.
[02:36:59.390 --> 02:37:00.831]  We see these headlines in the New York Times.
[02:37:01.391 --> 02:37:04.013]  Washington Post said, oh, we're going to get more ruthless.
[02:37:04.493 --> 02:37:05.554]  We're going to be more vicious.
[02:37:05.574 --> 02:37:08.456]  Well, I've experienced the mafia tactics of the Democrats.
[02:37:08.516 --> 02:37:14.641]  And so, what do we do about the Democrats threatening people to drive them into the arms of the Chinese dictator?
[02:37:17.254 --> 02:37:20.196]  I want to get to a basic psychiatric principle.
[02:37:21.296 --> 02:37:25.178]  The people in Silicon Valley are not smarter than anybody else.
[02:37:25.278 --> 02:37:31.982]  What they've done is to develop something that, you know, DARPA had done and the CIA had done in the 1950s and 60s.
[02:37:34.143 --> 02:37:39.868]  Let me give you an example of what I just said of President Xi of China, where he identifies with the aggressive.
[02:37:39.948 --> 02:37:46.694]  The Silicon Valley leader, like Sergey Brin, the father of Google, came out of the Soviet Union.
[02:37:46.854 --> 02:37:51.358]  It was I and others in the intelligence community who took down the Soviet Union.
[02:37:51.418 --> 02:37:53.380]  And what did he become?
[02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:55.702]  He became the Trotsky of the Internet.
[02:37:55.982 --> 02:38:00.206]  He became the very communist that we took them out of that system.
[02:38:00.326 --> 02:38:02.728]  So he began to identify with the aggressor.
[02:38:03.129 --> 02:38:05.431]  That's what you have with a bunch of these guys.
[02:38:05.491 --> 02:38:08.534]  They all become what we call liberal fascists.
[02:38:08.634 --> 02:38:11.477]  They think they can control the communications.
[02:38:11.557 --> 02:38:12.538]  They don't understand.
[02:38:12.558 --> 02:38:15.000]  They're just a method of communication.
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:17.162]  Zuckerberg isn't some genius.
[02:38:17.203 --> 02:38:23.630]  Zuckerberg was a sociopath who understood how to manipulate himself and get into social network in the movie.
[02:38:24.011 --> 02:38:25.673]  The same thing with Sergey Brin.
[02:38:25.793 --> 02:38:27.395]  I remember when he was at Stanford.
[02:38:27.435 --> 02:38:29.077]  He walked out of his PhD.
[02:38:29.397 --> 02:38:31.680]  But he's basically a fascist.
[02:38:32.140 --> 02:38:35.541]  He hadn't changed his communist mentality in any way.
[02:38:36.001 --> 02:38:50.545]  He decided to go into the search engine, which was then facilitated by the National Geospatial Agency, whom I've called up and said, look, guys, you better get your algorithm in control because none of your algorithms are correct.
[02:38:50.925 --> 02:38:54.067]  And they said, no, no, no, the father of the Internet understood that.
[02:38:54.107 --> 02:38:56.088]  I said, there is no father of the Internet.
[02:38:56.448 --> 02:39:13.057]  If I knew about it at MIT and my PhD in 1971, 72, about social media, then you can't tell me Sergey Brin and Marty and Zuckerberg, all these Jewish guys, are such geniuses that I was already trained in social media and the Internet.
[02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:17.119]  My dad in the late 60s was at UT and they already had results.
[02:39:17.340 --> 02:39:17.780]  It was all very
[02:39:18.320 --> 02:39:18.800]  Restricted.
[02:39:19.121 --> 02:39:20.802]  But it already had CD-ROM.
[02:39:20.842 --> 02:39:22.703]  They were calling it information energy.
[02:39:22.983 --> 02:39:24.804]  They were talking about social media networks.
[02:39:24.864 --> 02:39:26.805]  I mean, it was already being theoritized then.
[02:39:27.381 --> 02:39:27.881]  Exactly.
[02:39:27.961 --> 02:39:34.646]  So what happened is the government, instead of coming in and saying, OK, this is enough nonsense on behalf of Google.
[02:39:34.946 --> 02:39:37.128]  This is nonsense on behalf of Facebook.
[02:39:37.508 --> 02:39:39.630]  Facebook is going down financially.
[02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:42.112]  Google has had a problem financially.
[02:39:42.452 --> 02:39:44.954]  Facebook now has a problem financially.
[02:39:45.274 --> 02:39:48.616]  And so what's happening is the government went right in.
[02:39:48.636 --> 02:39:53.060]  Intel decided, that's part of the CIA, that they're going to invest in this.
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:56.442]  But instead of learning how to open up the system,
[02:39:56.922 --> 02:40:07.348]  What they were doing, and it's something that Roger Stone said, they're trying to measure how much dissension we can have within this internet system and see what's tolerated.
[02:40:07.488 --> 02:40:13.611]  Well, from my point of view, I think it's time for Trump to come in and say, okay, you want to control this?
[02:40:13.911 --> 02:40:16.213]  You're going to have to pay a very heavy fee for it.
[02:40:16.593 --> 02:40:22.876]  Because now you've got a man who came out of the communist Russia, Soviet Union, and is worth $50 billion.
[02:40:22.916 --> 02:40:24.277]  Give me a break.
[02:40:24.737 --> 02:40:27.158]  The guy didn't do anything that was so brilliant.
[02:40:44.986 --> 02:40:45.867]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:41:04.722 --> 02:41:09.464]  We, the United States of America, created that internet and social media.
[02:41:09.524 --> 02:41:10.385]  China did not.
[02:41:10.825 --> 02:41:18.629]  What China did over the 10, 15 years, the 20 years, which we allowed them to do, was to steal our technology and to take it.
[02:41:19.089 --> 02:41:21.350]  In turn, Trump just said, that's enough.
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:23.121]  And that's a problem.
[02:41:23.241 --> 02:41:29.625]  Whether it's the Democrats or Republicans, I mean, you have Soros as just a pawn in the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:41:29.705 --> 02:41:31.666]  It's a buffoon's entity.
[02:41:31.746 --> 02:41:38.631]  I mean, I left the Council because it's a geriatric unit of people who really couldn't do very much and don't know what to do.
[02:41:38.871 --> 02:41:40.232]  And you have buffoons there.
[02:41:40.252 --> 02:41:41.413]  You have the Hillary Clintons.
[02:41:41.753 --> 02:41:43.214]  You have the Soros and all that.
[02:41:43.254 --> 02:41:44.555]  Doctor, I agree with you.
[02:41:44.575 --> 02:41:45.716]  You know, come back and break it down.
[02:41:45.756 --> 02:41:46.356]  Here's the problem.
[02:41:46.696 --> 02:41:50.459]  They're still in quasi-control, which makes it more dangerous that they are buffoons.
[02:41:51.909 --> 02:42:01.732]  Well, the control that's really there is the CIA, the NRO, the NSA, and the fact that we are not in the forefront of cyber security.
[02:42:02.173 --> 02:42:13.337]  One of the things that I've protested and wanted is to make a member of the cabinet a senior member of the government in charge of cyber security.
[02:42:13.497 --> 02:42:16.318]  John Bolton has no idea about cyber security.
[02:42:16.738 --> 02:42:18.819]  We put in a general called Nakasone.
[02:42:18.939 --> 02:42:19.939]  That is not enough.
[02:42:20.479 --> 02:42:32.181]  He has to have the level of a, uh, literally a representative... No, I agree, stay there, because Silicon Valley does not respect the federal government, or the president, or the people, or the First Amendment.
[02:42:32.741 --> 02:42:33.321]  I mean, that's it.
[02:42:33.841 --> 02:42:35.982]  And they need to be brought to heel.
[02:42:37.822 --> 02:42:39.222]  You have asked, are we happy?
[02:42:40.063 --> 02:42:41.323]  Are we happy and effective?
[02:42:42.703 --> 02:42:47.644]  Consultation with leading experts in the field makes it perfectly clear, perfectly clear,
[02:42:51.005 --> 02:42:53.988]  That we are all now programmed for perfect happiness.
[02:42:54.468 --> 02:42:55.369]  Perfect happiness.
[02:42:56.049 --> 02:42:56.970]  Perfect happiness.
[02:42:57.611 --> 02:42:58.511]  Perfect happiness.
[02:42:58.992 --> 02:42:59.592]  What's wrong?
[02:42:59.712 --> 02:43:01.254]  Nothing, nothing really.
[02:43:01.314 --> 02:43:02.975]  I just feel that I need something stronger.
[02:43:03.295 --> 02:43:06.678]  If you have a problem, don't hesitate to ask for assistance.
[02:43:06.879 --> 02:43:08.039]  Yes, thank you.
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:09.541]  I'll be alright.
[02:43:09.721 --> 02:43:12.924]  Call 3485... We are sorry, but we must deny your request.
[02:43:13.969 --> 02:43:18.191]  Birthborns are not allowed more than five units of Entervol.
[02:43:18.251 --> 02:43:25.053]  Remember, substitution of Entervol for Etrozine may cause a serious chemical imbalance.
[02:43:25.653 --> 02:43:26.193]  Thank you.
[02:43:26.994 --> 02:43:27.874]  Work hard.
[02:43:28.254 --> 02:43:28.994]  What's wrong?
[02:43:29.554 --> 02:43:31.035]  Increase production.
[02:43:31.175 --> 02:43:32.736]  What's wrong?
[02:43:32.956 --> 02:43:34.296]  Prevent accidents.
[02:43:34.976 --> 02:43:36.457]  What's wrong?
[02:43:37.057 --> 02:43:39.558]  And, de-hacking.
[02:43:43.908 --> 02:43:45.709]  We're good.

[02:44:50.475 --> 02:44:52.035]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[02:44:53.616 --> 02:44:54.896]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:44:54.996 --> 02:44:56.916]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:44:56.936 --> 02:44:58.297]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:44:58.317 --> 02:44:59.297]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:45:16.741 --> 02:45:19.885]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:45:20.205 --> 02:45:23.228]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:45:23.248 --> 02:45:24.589]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[02:45:24.610 --> 02:45:24.810]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:45:24.830 --> 02:45:25.751]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:37.363 --> 02:45:43.047]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[02:45:43.347 --> 02:45:47.370]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[02:45:47.811 --> 02:45:50.012]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[02:45:50.052 --> 02:45:52.174]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[02:45:52.534 --> 02:45:54.535]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[02:45:55.056 --> 02:45:55.296]  Boom!
[02:45:55.576 --> 02:45:57.838]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[02:45:58.198 --> 02:45:59.759]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[02:45:59.799 --> 02:46:01.621]  You still have Infowars Store.
[02:46:01.681 --> 02:46:02.801]  You still have a shopfront.
[02:46:03.002 --> 02:46:03.782]  And then what do we see?
[02:46:04.062 --> 02:46:04.823]  Washington Post.
[02:46:05.383 --> 02:46:08.485]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[02:46:08.525 --> 02:46:12.968]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[02:46:13.008 --> 02:46:15.830]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[02:46:16.150 --> 02:46:21.574]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:21.854 --> 02:46:28.859]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros, like Media Matters is, to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[02:46:29.199 --> 02:46:32.601]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships, like CNN is.
[02:46:32.861 --> 02:46:33.882]  We're only funded by you.
[02:46:34.302 --> 02:46:37.063]  By getting the products at InFootballStore.com.
[02:46:41.664 --> 02:46:44.385]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:50.247 --> 02:46:54.288]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[02:46:56.237 --> 02:46:59.840]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:03.522]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[02:47:06.513 --> 02:47:10.435]  He said it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[02:47:11.276 --> 02:47:13.437]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:13.957 --> 02:47:20.081]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:47:20.861 --> 02:47:22.562]  Imagine being President Trump.
[02:47:22.802 --> 02:47:27.045]  He knows about classic Americana economic moves.
[02:47:27.625 --> 02:47:32.308]  He knows if China has a huge tariff on us and Canada has a huge tariff, that you've got to say no to that.
[02:47:33.342 --> 02:47:34.683]  But that's not free trade.
[02:47:35.124 --> 02:47:39.407]  So he's able to get a few basic things done that have turned the economy around to a great extent.
[02:47:41.109 --> 02:47:48.315]  But imagine the arrogance of these Google owners, five or six of them worth $30, $40, $50, $60, $70 billion a piece.
[02:47:49.977 --> 02:47:54.781]  You've got Apple, and you've got this new royalty, and it's all black boxes.
[02:47:55.482 --> 02:47:56.462]  And they're all super rich.
[02:47:56.482 --> 02:47:57.744]  They've all got teams of lobbyists.
[02:47:59.025 --> 02:47:59.926]  So when Congress says,
[02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:05.572]  Google, you won't work with the Pentagon, but you'll work with China and state-run stuff.
[02:48:06.812 --> 02:48:08.053]  They say, we're not even showing up.
[02:48:09.193 --> 02:48:17.397]  And it's because if you watch those hearings on C-SPAN or in person like I've done, those senators are lawyers.
[02:48:18.057 --> 02:48:19.058]  And they know how to act smart.
[02:48:19.218 --> 02:48:20.098]  They know how to play golf.
[02:48:20.819 --> 02:48:23.200]  But man, they don't know anything about the internet.
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:24.520]  They don't know about starting a business.
[02:48:25.241 --> 02:48:28.162]  They don't have any optics.
[02:48:28.442 --> 02:48:30.263]  So imagine the president is trying to drive the car,
[02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:36.923]  And he can't even look out the window because it's all blacked out because he doesn't have anybody working for him that knows what's going on.
[02:48:37.624 --> 02:48:45.367]  And he just is in the blind going, well, I've got a few readouts here that I could cut taxes and I could, if tariffs aren't fair, I could lower them.
[02:48:46.067 --> 02:48:48.288]  And people are already like, there's a genius inside that cockpit.
[02:48:48.308 --> 02:48:48.849]  What's he doing?
[02:48:49.109 --> 02:48:50.269]  He can't even see out.
[02:48:50.309 --> 02:48:51.870]  There's not even a portal to look out of.
[02:48:52.390 --> 02:48:55.832]  Now we're out here on the outside watching it with Dr. Pachinick saying is central.
[02:48:57.082 --> 02:48:58.843]  He needs a cyber council.
[02:48:59.424 --> 02:49:02.106]  Everything is this before the election and after.
[02:49:03.226 --> 02:49:06.989]  So that's the biggest blind spot is they're cutting Trump out from under himself.
[02:49:07.709 --> 02:49:09.331]  They're undercutting our economy.
[02:49:10.011 --> 02:49:13.233]  The cyber's kind of scared that we may wake up, so they've all run to China.
[02:49:14.234 --> 02:49:18.377]  And it's just a very, very dangerous position to be in, because I don't say this to act smart.
[02:49:19.257 --> 02:49:22.339]  I sat there and I watched Google in person and then on television go,
[02:49:23.203 --> 02:49:24.804]  We're not building any censorship.
[02:49:24.864 --> 02:49:26.125]  We don't know what you're talking about.
[02:49:26.645 --> 02:49:30.088]  Three weeks later, the head of Google's in a letter like, you ought to love it!
[02:49:30.148 --> 02:49:30.968]  It'll help you!
[02:49:31.248 --> 02:49:32.029]  What's the big deal?
[02:49:32.049 --> 02:49:34.510]  We're just curating, like Applehead said.
[02:49:36.051 --> 02:49:37.052]  And I look at this.
[02:49:38.853 --> 02:49:39.894]  It's a double entendre.
[02:49:39.934 --> 02:49:41.955]  Tim Cook doesn't look like a little rotten applehead.
[02:49:41.975 --> 02:49:51.362]  I mean, these people are classic authoritarians, prancing around, helping a dictatorship kill people, and then saying, we took Alex Jones off, he's a fascist, and
[02:49:52.321 --> 02:49:54.663]  They're engaged in a total purge of everybody's speech.
[02:49:54.723 --> 02:49:56.324]  It's even killing their own platforms.
[02:49:57.045 --> 02:49:59.627]  And people are resigning from all these institutions en masse.
[02:50:00.127 --> 02:50:01.628]  And they're just virtue signaling.
[02:50:02.269 --> 02:50:04.750]  So, Dr. Pucinich, what does the President do?
[02:50:04.810 --> 02:50:10.295]  Because now in today's economy, cyber stuff is obviously tied to everything.
[02:50:10.315 --> 02:50:13.057]  And so I think it's the only place Trump hasn't acted yet.
[02:50:13.077 --> 02:50:15.438]  He's done a few things, but I think he should act now.
[02:50:15.539 --> 02:50:17.280]  What would you do if you were advising the President?
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:23.512]  I would tell him there's a general named Keith Alexander who's now in private practice.
[02:50:23.773 --> 02:50:24.675]  I've worked with him in G2.
[02:50:26.612 --> 02:50:28.554]  And he's worked in other areas.
[02:50:28.634 --> 02:50:30.015]  He has a private company.
[02:50:30.175 --> 02:50:33.137]  I would make him a cabinet level officer.
[02:50:33.357 --> 02:50:40.563]  Cabinet level, where he would be in charge and then he would oversee everything in cyber security.
[02:50:40.983 --> 02:50:44.446]  Make sure we were number one in cyber security in the world.
[02:50:44.946 --> 02:50:53.673]  Make sure that Google, Facebook and every other so-called technical company complies with our constitution and doesn't
[02:50:54.293 --> 02:50:56.635]  Eradicate our First Amendment rights.
[02:50:57.195 --> 02:51:07.542]  And basically, once you have that cabinet position, it will override John Bolton, it will override the Defense Department, and basically make it a cabinet position.
[02:51:07.622 --> 02:51:15.887]  Right now, we have a very good general named Matt Passoni, who is the deputy to Keith Alexander, but we need it at the cabinet level.
[02:51:16.407 --> 02:51:21.651]  I cannot have cyber security in the Department of Homeland Security, where it's buried.
[02:51:21.791 --> 02:51:23.933]  I can't have the CIA have the unit.
[02:51:24.093 --> 02:51:25.974]  I can't have the FBI have the unit.
[02:51:26.355 --> 02:51:27.535]  It's too fragmented.
[02:51:27.756 --> 02:51:31.158]  I do not need F-35s that are failing.
[02:51:31.178 --> 02:51:33.560]  These are super fighters that are stealth.
[02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:35.441]  They can't fly.
[02:51:35.521 --> 02:51:38.123]  $385 million for each one of these planes.
[02:51:38.624 --> 02:51:41.446]  Instead, I could have built a whole capability
[02:51:42.046 --> 02:52:00.499]  In national security, on cyber command, cyber security, the reason I wrote... Well, the enemy's jets could never even take off, but expanding on that, this national security crisis, and that's why Big Tech's running circles around Trump, is he has a bunch of buffoons in there that don't even know what they're dealing with.
[02:52:00.519 --> 02:52:05.823]  I mean, everything is cyber, and it's a crisis.
[02:52:06.789 --> 02:52:11.532]  Well, I agree with you, but he picked John Bolton, and he picked him for reasons that I don't agree with.
[02:52:11.652 --> 02:52:14.634]  John was never qualified to be in this position.
[02:52:15.054 --> 02:52:17.556]  I've known John over several administrations.
[02:52:18.096 --> 02:52:21.918]  He has one thing that I share with him, which is I'm against the UN.
[02:52:21.978 --> 02:52:23.159]  It's totally useless.
[02:52:23.299 --> 02:52:24.740]  I've used them in peacekeeping.
[02:52:25.100 --> 02:52:28.062]  They were worthless, but John got rid of the cyber security.
[02:52:28.602 --> 02:52:32.225]  You have a general there who's a good general, Kelly, but he knows nothing about such.
[02:52:32.286 --> 02:52:33.146]  Well, here's what's happening.
[02:52:33.206 --> 02:52:38.711]  Trump's supposedly going to talk to him at the end of the month, and the Pentagon's going to talk to him first, talk to these people.
[02:52:38.731 --> 02:52:43.956]  They need to call him in and say, stop lying, and they should send the heads of the companies, not their underlings.
[02:52:44.256 --> 02:52:49.260]  And if they send underlings who don't, and then lie, I'm sorry, this is the number one national security threat.
[02:52:49.581 --> 02:52:50.702]  These people are the threat.
[02:52:50.942 --> 02:52:52.523]  They're the ones selling us out to China.
[02:52:52.784 --> 02:52:53.945]  And so they need to either
[02:52:54.645 --> 02:52:59.476]  Get out of the way or they need to get in some serious trouble because right now they've shown themselves to be authoritarian monsters.
[02:53:00.342 --> 02:53:00.702]  Correct.
[02:53:00.902 --> 02:53:01.583]  I agree with you.
[02:53:01.643 --> 02:53:08.786]  There has to be a penalty for what they do and I would have it imposed from somebody who is at the cabinet level where it's created.
[02:53:09.187 --> 02:53:11.748]  John Bolton has no idea about cybersecurity.
[02:53:11.788 --> 02:53:16.430]  He's part of the Yale group with Bob Woodward, David Martin, all of those boys.
[02:53:16.530 --> 02:53:17.131]  Cheney.
[02:53:17.491 --> 02:53:20.032]  He's one of Cheney's little boys and Bush Jr.'
[02:53:19.992 --> 02:53:20.672]  's little boys.
[02:53:20.773 --> 02:53:25.195]  I mean, these are all... Don't they get big techs running circles around them and laughing at them?
[02:53:25.831 --> 02:53:26.211]  Correct.
[02:53:26.431 --> 02:53:26.832]  They are.
[02:53:26.932 --> 02:53:34.297]  Because they can call him a neocon, and they say, oh well, he created the Iraq War, and we're for peace, and we're for love, and we're for everything.
[02:53:34.597 --> 02:53:36.199]  Of course, they too are fascists.
[02:53:36.539 --> 02:53:39.861]  Fascists don't come only from the right side, they come from the left side.
[02:53:40.201 --> 02:53:47.647]  So you have equally two fascist societies, and you and I are in the middle, where they demonetize me, and they demonetize you.
[02:53:48.357 --> 02:53:53.561]  So whatever narrative we have, we're cutting through all this fascism and saying, you know what?
[02:53:53.901 --> 02:53:55.842]  I really don't even need the federal government.
[02:53:56.242 --> 02:53:56.903]  I don't need.
[02:53:56.983 --> 02:53:59.264]  And you were right on when you said about senators.
[02:53:59.705 --> 02:54:03.968]  Do you think Senator Rubio from Florida has any intellect?
[02:54:04.008 --> 02:54:07.010]  He comes out of Santa Fe College right next to me.
[02:54:07.350 --> 02:54:08.751]  He's not the brightest whip.
[02:54:09.131 --> 02:54:11.972]  He had a history of questionable sexuality.
[02:54:12.373 --> 02:54:14.814]  His brother-in-law was in the drug business.
[02:54:15.194 --> 02:54:18.395]  He says his parents came over because they fled communism.
[02:54:18.475 --> 02:54:19.056]  Nonsense!
[02:54:19.416 --> 02:54:20.396]  I was born in Cuba.
[02:54:20.737 --> 02:54:22.077]  Rubio was not born in Cuba.
[02:54:22.097 --> 02:54:22.958]  He's an American.
[02:54:23.018 --> 02:54:24.298]  Never served our country.
[02:54:24.778 --> 02:54:27.780]  Went to Mormon areas and he did nothing.
[02:54:28.260 --> 02:54:31.363]  But be a sycophant so he could get to the top.
[02:54:31.403 --> 02:54:37.489]  He never created a business, never understood how to do anything constructive, but that's your senator.
[02:54:37.769 --> 02:54:40.412]  The other senator I have is a moron, Bill Nelson.
[02:54:41.129 --> 02:54:47.511]  Graduate of Yale, made sure that all our mosaic mind companies... And by the way, I want to go to a hearing and see smart senators.
[02:54:47.651 --> 02:55:01.296]  As a citizen, it's frightening to not think of myself as an expert, and then I literally, literally go, I know hundreds of times what they do about the internet, cyber security, and the Chai comms, because I actually read what the Chai comms brag about.
[02:55:01.596 --> 02:55:08.699]  The Chai comms brag in their newspapers how they're our enemy, and how they've bought us up, and how we're a joke, and it pisses me off.
[02:55:09.673 --> 02:55:28.463]  Well, it pisses you off and it pisses me off, but when I wrote Pax Pacifica 25 years ago, the only one who understood it was the former CIA chief of China, and that was Jim Lilley, who understood that I was warning that there would be a war over the Spratly Islands, and lo and behold, where are we?
[02:55:28.943 --> 02:55:30.084]  Let me ask you that.
[02:55:30.144 --> 02:55:37.930]  What do you think China's doing, even claiming territorial waters down by the Philippines and belligerently?
[02:55:38.551 --> 02:55:39.852]  What is their point in all this?
[02:55:41.894 --> 02:55:47.578]  You have to understand China's notion of itself is not as a nation, it's as the Middle Kingdom.
[02:55:47.698 --> 02:55:52.142]  In other words, they belong to all of Asia and all of Asia belongs to China.
[02:55:52.582 --> 02:55:58.187]  That is a complex that even Bush Senior talked about, but we were aware of it when I had a deal with the Chinese.
[02:55:58.827 --> 02:56:00.728]  Everything really belongs to them.
[02:56:00.788 --> 02:56:06.350]  You have to feed them, you have to nurture them, because destiny is theirs, and time is on their side.
[02:56:06.450 --> 02:56:14.173]  So they claim that the entire South China Sea is theirs, when in fact we do not belong there with our CINCPAC commanders.
[02:56:14.253 --> 02:56:24.397]  In fact, we have been there longer than the Chinese as a national security element, and we're basically stating we're not leaving the South China Sea, we're not leaving the Scranton.
[02:56:24.637 --> 02:56:28.878]  On China's question, they've been shooting at our ships and threatening, so Trump's increased patrols.
[02:56:29.518 --> 02:56:30.678]  What do you expect to happen there?
[02:56:31.698 --> 02:56:49.942]  Well, what's happening, and General Mattis understands it, that we're basically going to increase our military presence, our navy presence, our nuclear presence, our air force presence, so that China will back off at some point because literally she cannot afford what he's doing at this point.
[02:56:50.502 --> 02:56:54.483]  China is not in a position after 30 years of self-aggrandizing.
[02:56:54.503 --> 02:56:55.644]  We got to go to break.
[02:56:55.724 --> 02:57:10.388]  Come back in two minutes and do five minutes on China because I know you're really smart on it and then where you see this going because yeah their population is their problem and and and all the destabilization there and what they're thinking straight ahead and then we have got another guest host coming up in the fourth hour.

[02:57:31.716 --> 02:57:34.877]  Okay, so I have a gift here from the folks at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:35.017 --> 02:57:40.199]  They wanted to thank me for getting the InfoWars t-shirts on the Rangers game for millions of people at sea.
[02:57:40.219 --> 02:57:41.119]  So they just brought me a gift.
[02:57:41.139 --> 02:57:42.220]  I don't even know what this is.
[02:57:45.715 --> 02:57:45.935]  No.
[02:57:47.235 --> 02:57:47.556]  No!
[02:57:48.036 --> 02:57:48.596]  I got it!
[02:57:50.236 --> 02:57:51.517]  It's a Trump-Medusa shirt!
[02:57:51.537 --> 02:57:52.377]  Look at that, guys!
[02:57:55.838 --> 02:57:57.358]  I got the Trump-Medusa shirt!
[02:57:58.038 --> 02:57:58.358]  What's that?
[02:57:58.378 --> 02:57:59.059]  There's more in there?
[02:57:59.539 --> 02:58:00.639]  Oh!
[02:58:01.279 --> 02:58:02.560]  It's a George Washington!
[02:58:02.900 --> 02:58:03.340]  Wow.
[02:58:04.520 --> 02:58:05.981]  I was not expecting this, really.
[02:58:06.021 --> 02:58:06.721]  Look at that one.
[02:58:07.241 --> 02:58:08.721]  That'll trigger somebody real good.
[02:58:09.622 --> 02:58:09.962]  Oh, yeah.
[02:58:11.622 --> 02:58:12.362]  Wow, wow.
[02:58:12.402 --> 02:58:14.643]  I'm like a kid on Christmas today.
[02:58:16.351 --> 02:58:18.494]  I want to thank the folks at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:58:18.514 --> 02:58:19.635]  This is amazing.
[02:58:19.695 --> 02:58:20.897]  I was not expecting this.
[02:58:28.145 --> 02:58:28.606]  Look at that.
[02:58:28.626 --> 02:58:31.329]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[02:58:31.389 --> 02:58:32.751]  That's because it's been denatured.
[02:58:32.791 --> 02:58:33.592]  It's been watered down.
[02:58:33.612 --> 02:58:34.673]  We didn't do that.
[02:58:36.340 --> 02:58:42.565]  If you think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get, I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[02:58:43.165 --> 02:58:51.692]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[02:58:52.172 --> 02:58:53.874]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[02:58:53.894 --> 02:58:55.014]  Don't you get the big secret?
[02:58:55.375 --> 02:58:58.217]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[02:58:58.257 --> 02:58:59.358]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[02:59:00.138 --> 02:59:03.061]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[02:59:10.657 --> 02:59:10.977]  Look it up.
[02:59:12.078 --> 02:59:18.101]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[02:59:18.121 --> 02:59:22.964]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[02:59:23.445 --> 02:59:26.646]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[02:59:29.748 --> 02:59:35.652]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:54.308 --> 03:00:01.651]  Alright, Dr. Steve Pachinik, stevepachinik.com is our guest.
[03:00:01.691 --> 03:00:03.292]  Find out his latest books there on his site.
[03:00:03.973 --> 03:00:09.976]  Coming up, Matt Bracken is going to break down 22 Days Out, where the Democrats are planning for violence, false flags, who knows?
[03:00:09.996 --> 03:00:10.636]  We'll talk about it.
[03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:21.035]  But getting back to China, because it's central, and in the 60 Minutes interview the President said, listen, we don't have any evidence that Russia's really doing anything, and I'm certainly not involved in them, but whatever, forget Russia.
[03:00:21.595 --> 03:00:30.380]  China's the big issue, and you look at the left and the corporations and the Democrats basically bending over backwards to defend China.
[03:00:32.201 --> 03:00:35.883]  In the final equation, they're building all these little islands, which is a repeat
[03:00:36.914 --> 03:00:39.100]  of the Japanese seizing islands.
[03:00:39.582 --> 03:00:44.937]  So I guess their argument is we won't have to seize islands if we just build islands, but I just don't...
[03:00:46.108 --> 03:00:51.652]  It seems like, at a very primitive level, kind of like just planting the flag and then shooting at our ships.
[03:00:51.712 --> 03:00:57.716]  Don't they know that if they did have America under their control, they did it because they were going slow?
[03:00:57.857 --> 03:01:02.200]  And I think you said it earlier, I think they're pushing too hard as Awaking the Sleeping Giant.
[03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:08.264]  Even Vice President Pence, who I know you don't trust, he said there's a growing consensus that China is the threat.
[03:01:09.730 --> 03:01:10.451]  I agree with that.
[03:01:10.831 --> 03:01:18.020]  And what China has to remember is, number one, we have about 100 to 200 bases all around China.
[03:01:18.886 --> 03:01:22.928]  China's aware of it, but they don't really understand how we can affect them.
[03:01:23.149 --> 03:01:24.229]  Let me give you an example.
[03:01:24.329 --> 03:01:42.780]  When China's out of control, I might suggest that we stimulate a problem on the border of Bhutan, where the Indian army comes in and basically has a conflict, or a small, what we call low-intensity conflict with the Chinese,
[03:01:43.440 --> 03:02:09.069]  Over the water in the Ganji because China is highly highly dependent on water if we close off the Himalayas and We close off the water supplies that come to China China will die very quickly She knows this we know this so that's number one water starvation number two they have a false economy where the debt and
[03:02:09.509 --> 03:02:12.010]  To add to asset ratio is negative.
[03:02:12.030 --> 03:02:17.811]  In other words, they don't want to admit that the trillions of dollars of mortgages are worthless.
[03:02:18.211 --> 03:02:22.293]  Yet they put it on the book as if they had assets worth trillions of dollars.
[03:02:22.653 --> 03:02:25.393]  They refuse to do what we call mark to the market.
[03:02:25.433 --> 03:02:29.515]  In other words, your trillion dollar debt isn't worth but one million dollars.
[03:02:29.555 --> 03:02:30.795]  So he doesn't want to do that.
[03:02:31.295 --> 03:02:36.657]  Number three, he's using a lot of repression for any dissidents who comes out.
[03:02:36.777 --> 03:02:56.743]  Now, when you have a population that's under the age of 30, and your percentage of the population is going up to 30-40%, whether they're under the age of 30, you no longer are in control, despite the fact that you might think you're the head of a communist party, which is an arcane institution in China.
[03:02:57.144 --> 03:02:58.184]  As I said before,
[03:02:58.744 --> 03:03:02.692]  Mao Zedong was not really the leader of China, of the new China.
[03:03:02.812 --> 03:03:10.887]  It was Deng Xiaoping who said, go forth and use whatever you need to do, but hide your strength and bide your time.
[03:03:11.645 --> 03:03:19.030]  Xi has failed to do that repeatedly, and the Chinese people understand that he has a problem.
[03:03:19.450 --> 03:03:23.192]  The PLA is not happy with him if he doesn't have enough money.
[03:03:23.512 --> 03:03:33.359]  At the same time, he's suppressing the Uyghurs, the Muslim Chinese who make up a major percentage of his army and national security force.
[03:03:33.739 --> 03:03:37.221]  The more he represses them, the bigger the problem is going to be.
[03:03:37.641 --> 03:03:40.423]  So it's not hard to destabilize China
[03:03:40.503 --> 03:03:43.425]  Sure, they have something like 7,000 riots a month in China.
[03:03:44.285 --> 03:03:44.705]  Correct.
[03:03:45.226 --> 03:03:51.069]  And they don't advertise that, but that's exactly, and it's going up in the numbers.
[03:03:51.149 --> 03:03:53.530]  We can increase the numbers at will.
[03:03:53.570 --> 03:03:56.872]  So the bottom line is China's been pushing us around with traitors inside the government.
[03:03:57.152 --> 03:04:01.055]  Trump's just doing moderate resistance, which is derailing them because they're so weak.
[03:04:01.395 --> 03:04:03.496]  And now they respect it more and more.
[03:04:03.516 --> 03:04:04.897]  They're going to probably have to capitulate.
[03:04:06.169 --> 03:04:06.349]  Yes.
[03:04:22.233 --> 03:04:25.298]  Hold on, that's a cliffhanger.
[03:04:25.318 --> 03:04:27.061]  You gotta do 60 seconds more on the other side.
[03:04:27.121 --> 03:04:29.926]  Back in 60 seconds, Dr. Steve McGinnick and Matt Bracken's taking over.
[03:04:30.006 --> 03:04:32.029]  What is it Trump says that's so important?
[03:04:32.049 --> 03:04:34.333]  SteveMcGinnick.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:04:34.353 --> 03:04:35.114]  Spread those links.
[03:04:35.374 --> 03:04:36.135]  The enemy hates them.

[03:05:44.921 --> 03:05:48.824]  China has been chosen to muscle out the rest of the world by the government.
[03:05:48.904 --> 03:05:49.264]  China.
[03:05:49.625 --> 03:05:50.205]  Live.
[03:05:50.565 --> 03:05:50.945]  Raw.
[03:05:51.326 --> 03:05:52.186]  And unfiltered.
[03:05:53.227 --> 03:05:54.988]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:05:56.089 --> 03:05:58.551]  But China's run by an authoritarian system.
[03:05:58.631 --> 03:05:59.632]  I love the Chinese people.
[03:05:59.692 --> 03:06:00.292]  I love China.
[03:06:00.713 --> 03:06:02.194]  I want them to have a great future.
[03:06:02.234 --> 03:06:07.698]  But to blame Russia and to start a fight with Russia all day when China is the main threat is treasonous.
[03:06:08.138 --> 03:06:09.119]  But we're here exposing it.
[03:06:09.159 --> 03:06:10.800]  Here was the president last night on 60 Minutes.
[03:06:11.100 --> 03:06:12.782]  Look at final comments from Dr. Steve Pachinik.
[03:06:12.802 --> 03:06:13.142]  Here it is.
[03:06:15.349 --> 03:06:15.569]  Yeah.
[03:06:15.589 --> 03:06:16.750]  Okay.
[03:06:18.011 --> 03:06:22.453]  People don't understand why you never have a harsh word for Vladimir Putin.
[03:06:22.533 --> 03:06:23.173]  Okay, you're right.
[03:06:23.193 --> 03:06:24.314]  I don't understand.
[03:06:24.574 --> 03:06:27.775]  You don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference?
[03:06:27.795 --> 03:06:28.536]  I mean publicly.
[03:06:28.596 --> 03:06:30.096]  You never say anything harsh about him publicly.
[03:06:30.117 --> 03:06:30.317]  Excuse me.
[03:06:30.337 --> 03:06:30.717]  I didn't.
[03:06:31.357 --> 03:06:36.900]  I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.
[03:06:37.100 --> 03:06:37.720]  Obama didn't.
[03:06:37.740 --> 03:06:38.341]  You know what he said?
[03:06:40.038 --> 03:06:40.539]  ...blankets.
[03:06:41.221 --> 03:06:48.133]  I'm the one, and he's the one, that gave away a part of Ukraine, where Russia now has this operation.
[03:06:48.153 --> 03:06:49.335]  No, I mean him personally.
[03:06:50.487 --> 03:06:52.770]  I think I'm very tough with him, personally.
[03:06:52.930 --> 03:06:53.911]  I had a meeting with him.
[03:06:54.071 --> 03:06:54.972]  The two of us.
[03:06:55.192 --> 03:06:58.255]  It was a very tough meeting, and it was a very good meeting.
[03:06:58.495 --> 03:07:02.620]  Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?
[03:07:03.561 --> 03:07:04.522]  In poisonings?
[03:07:04.662 --> 03:07:05.983]  Probably he is, yeah.
[03:07:06.063 --> 03:07:06.524]  Probably.
[03:07:07.024 --> 03:07:07.485]  Probably?
[03:07:07.605 --> 03:07:09.086]  Probably, but I rely on them.
[03:07:09.146 --> 03:07:10.548]  It's not in our country.
[03:07:10.568 --> 03:07:11.569]  Okay, why not?
[03:07:11.949 --> 03:07:12.710]  They shouldn't do it.
[03:07:12.830 --> 03:07:13.911]  This is a terrible thing.
[03:07:13.931 --> 03:07:14.891]  Of course they shouldn't do it.
[03:07:15.212 --> 03:07:20.895]  Do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 election?
[03:07:22.056 --> 03:07:24.558]  They meddled, but I think China meddled too.
[03:07:24.898 --> 03:07:28.000]  Why do you say China meddled too?
[03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:29.981]  Why don't you just say the Russians meddled?
[03:07:30.121 --> 03:07:31.783]  Because I think China meddled also.
[03:07:32.623 --> 03:07:36.408]  And I think, frankly, China is a bigger problem.
[03:07:36.428 --> 03:07:38.952]  You're diverting the whole Russian thing.
[03:07:38.972 --> 03:07:39.893]  I'm not doing anything.
[03:07:40.033 --> 03:07:42.857]  I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China.
[03:07:44.599 --> 03:07:45.621]  And notice what he said there.
[03:07:47.276 --> 03:07:55.927]  It's Obama that allowed all this to happen, and it just gets crazier from that point on, with Lesley Stahl not even knowing what she's debating or what she's discussing.
[03:07:56.388 --> 03:08:02.676]  I mean, Trump probably had like 500 people killed last week, and they're sitting there asking the question about, does Putin kill anybody?
[03:08:03.017 --> 03:08:05.460]  I mean, it's like three-year-old talk, isn't it, Dr. Pachinik?
[03:08:06.440 --> 03:08:22.505]  Well, it's absurd because if Leslie Stoll was anyway informed, she would have known that on February 2018, Trump ordered Mattis to order the B-52s and the Apache helicopters to destroy the group.
[03:08:23.106 --> 03:08:23.286]  Yeah.
[03:08:41.409 --> 03:08:43.731]  I know who are my enemies are and I can handle that.
[03:08:43.851 --> 03:08:52.816]  The real problem I have is Trump is my friends and I'm not convinced that NATO is a good force and that's where he differs with matters but I agree with Trump.
[03:08:53.397 --> 03:09:09.747]  I'm not sure I want to help out Japan who demands that we have accompanying ships, gunships, Navy ships in order for them to get oil from the Middle East and then turns around and literally takes advantage of us in our cars and our science and everything else.
[03:09:09.807 --> 03:09:10.448]  So he's saying
[03:09:10.828 --> 03:09:12.049]  I can handle my enemies.
[03:09:12.369 --> 03:09:14.850]  It's my friends that I'm really mistrustful of.
[03:09:15.230 --> 03:09:16.711]  And that's the key to Trump.
[03:09:16.991 --> 03:09:18.251]  He's the businessman.
[03:09:18.672 --> 03:09:21.113]  He understands what's our national interest.
[03:09:21.173 --> 03:09:22.153]  It's not personal.
[03:09:22.513 --> 03:09:23.834]  He doesn't want to be liked.
[03:09:23.894 --> 03:09:27.336]  He doesn't care to be liked, even though it sounds like he cares to be liked.
[03:09:27.656 --> 03:09:34.439]  What he really cares about is what is good for America and what are you going to do for us, not what are we going to do for you.
[03:09:34.859 --> 03:09:37.340]  So with China, he knows exactly what he's doing.
[03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:39.001]  He's pushing them to brinksmanship.
[03:09:39.281 --> 03:09:47.051]  With Japan and Abe, he's warning them, listen, you may take advantage of us and think that you're our ally, but don't mess with me.
[03:09:47.492 --> 03:09:52.919]  I've been around business too long, so it's my friends that I have to watch more carefully.
[03:09:52.999 --> 03:09:54.461]  What's the larger Russia strategy?
[03:09:55.191 --> 03:09:58.053]  The larger Russia strategy is he leaves Putin alone.
[03:09:58.154 --> 03:10:00.556]  Putin hasn't done anything to us that harms us.
[03:10:00.956 --> 03:10:02.958]  Does Putin monitor our relations?
[03:10:02.978 --> 03:10:04.419]  He's got better things to do.
[03:10:04.519 --> 03:10:06.701]  Putin is building alliances in Iran.
[03:10:07.001 --> 03:10:08.582]  He has to deal with the Middle East.
[03:10:08.622 --> 03:10:15.948]  He took over some of our problems in the Middle East under Obama, who didn't know anything about what was going on and went into Libya.
[03:10:16.369 --> 03:10:20.332]  And our NATO forces went into Libya and destroyed the entire country.
[03:10:20.632 --> 03:10:22.254]  And what Trump is saying, you know what?
[03:10:22.774 --> 03:10:23.454]  I don't want that.
[03:10:23.894 --> 03:10:26.595]  And with Putin, I can figure out what we need to do.
[03:10:26.695 --> 03:10:27.916]  You take care of the Middle East.
[03:10:27.936 --> 03:10:32.217]  So it's a policy of stability versus the globalist policy of always creating crises.
[03:10:32.257 --> 03:10:34.278]  That's where Putin and Trump get along.
[03:10:35.098 --> 03:10:36.519]  That's exactly it, Alex.
[03:10:36.559 --> 03:10:37.539]  You hit it on the point.
[03:10:38.232 --> 03:10:44.113]  It is stability and national security for our benefit, not for the world, for the United States.
[03:10:44.393 --> 03:10:47.134]  And the Russians recognize nationalism and what's for your benefit.
[03:10:47.154 --> 03:10:47.814]  They respect that.
[03:10:48.074 --> 03:10:50.274]  So in some cases we'll butt heads, but at least it's clear.
[03:10:50.974 --> 03:10:51.835]  Final comment then.
[03:10:52.195 --> 03:10:59.636]  China is building TV and radio stations all along the Mexican border, beaming in Chinese propaganda to the huge Chinese population that's recently got here.
[03:10:59.956 --> 03:11:00.716]  I welcome the Chinese.
[03:11:00.736 --> 03:11:01.516]  Just become Americans.
[03:11:01.536 --> 03:11:02.717]  Don't be Chai Com operatives.
[03:11:02.957 --> 03:11:04.357]  But they threaten their families back at home.
[03:11:05.237 --> 03:11:14.964]  Not just in Pennsylvania or Ohio or Iowa, all over the country, I see clear Chinese propaganda and the honest American statesman by these Confucian societies at UT.
[03:11:15.004 --> 03:11:23.970]  I open the paper up, old people still read, and it's a double spread about, oh, Trump's bad on trade, and it admits China's paying for it.
[03:11:24.490 --> 03:11:28.193]  And so we don't have any evidence of Russia messing with our elections.
[03:11:28.253 --> 03:11:29.654]  If they are, go after them.
[03:11:30.094 --> 03:11:35.779]  But, I mean, he's pointing out that it's China that is in our business and it needs to be stopped.
[03:11:36.119 --> 03:11:43.065]  And some of these little belligerent people that are involved in Hollywood and other areas working with China, they need to be indicted.
[03:11:43.085 --> 03:11:46.048]  And if that's too embarrassing for everybody, whatever needs to happen.
[03:11:46.328 --> 03:11:48.130]  Because I want citizens to have rights.
[03:11:48.290 --> 03:11:48.750]  I have rights.
[03:11:48.790 --> 03:11:49.291]  You have rights.
[03:11:49.591 --> 03:11:50.351]  I follow the rules.
[03:11:50.411 --> 03:11:51.312]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[03:11:51.593 --> 03:11:52.433]  I'm a loyal American.
[03:11:52.733 --> 03:11:55.516]  I'm sick of being sanctioned and attacked like I'm a foreign enemy.
[03:11:55.836 --> 03:11:57.598]  I want to see the real foreign enemies attacked.
[03:11:58.138 --> 03:12:00.784]  I want to see them to start having some real problems.
[03:12:01.025 --> 03:12:04.051]  And I'm saying I'll back the president if they start having real problems.
[03:12:04.292 --> 03:12:05.975]  I think everybody else thinks that, Dr. Pichetting.
[03:12:06.236 --> 03:12:07.839]  I'm sick of sitting here and taking it!
[03:12:08.925 --> 03:12:10.926]  Well, you don't have to take it.
[03:12:11.006 --> 03:12:15.469]  And right now, what Trump is doing is baiting the Chinese in further.
[03:12:15.549 --> 03:12:21.892]  So when they have to put in little stations with all this kind of excuses, they are self-incriminating.
[03:12:22.052 --> 03:12:25.994]  In a way, what he's doing is, remember, he understands Sun Tzu.
[03:12:26.334 --> 03:12:34.919]  The Chinese in the very clear national security area, we're not part of the Communist Party, understands that he's taking down China.
[03:12:35.399 --> 03:12:46.832]  Peace by peace, week by week, within a few weeks he's going to meet with Xi and I'll guarantee you that there will be an agreement because Xi cannot continue what he's doing now.
[03:12:47.133 --> 03:12:49.255]  Remember he sent his daughter to Harvard.
[03:12:49.575 --> 03:12:51.578]  He came here and he spent time here.
[03:12:51.898 --> 03:12:53.340]  He has a Harvard train.
[03:12:53.860 --> 03:12:54.441]  Thank you.
[03:13:11.455 --> 03:13:11.815]  Thank you.
[03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:29.001]  And exactly, and the U.S.
[03:13:29.041 --> 03:13:30.442]  has never parlayed with North Korea.
[03:13:30.482 --> 03:13:35.767]  We can now use them against China, and they'll at least make concessions that'll really disquiet China.
[03:13:35.807 --> 03:13:38.529]  Then we have Vietnam on their border, who's ready to go to war with them.
[03:13:38.749 --> 03:13:40.110]  What about the Vietnam front?
[03:13:40.210 --> 03:13:54.222]  I think if we back Vietnam, they might even, because China's already been attacking their coastal oil fields, I bet we could open up a huge flank of non-conventional warfare and guerrilla warfare with Northern Vietnam and the Chai Koms.
[03:13:54.986 --> 03:14:03.188]  Well, what you hit again on Alex, the reason I'm smiling, is because the Vietnamese are the only country to have defeated China three different times.
[03:14:03.708 --> 03:14:06.788]  And China does not want to go up against the Vietnamese.
[03:14:06.868 --> 03:14:19.871]  Right now, they're in the Mekong Delta, and the Vietnamese will handle the Chinese, and the Chinese will regret that they ever have to go back into Vietnam, because they have defeated the Chinese repeatedly.
[03:14:20.451 --> 03:14:28.195]  And contrary to what we were told in the Vietnam War, the Chinese hate the Vietnamese and the Vietnamese hate the Chinese.
[03:14:28.555 --> 03:14:30.036]  So you're absolutely right.
[03:14:30.096 --> 03:14:31.337]  We can open that front.
[03:14:31.377 --> 03:14:35.439]  Well, I mean, as you know, Ho Chi Minh wanted us to ally with him against China and Japan.
[03:14:35.459 --> 03:14:36.019]  We didn't do it.
[03:14:36.700 --> 03:14:37.320]  That's correct.
[03:14:37.340 --> 03:14:38.461]  But you know your history.
[03:14:38.781 --> 03:14:40.682]  Why didn't you tell us in Westmoreland that?
[03:14:40.982 --> 03:14:42.423]  We had generals who didn't know that.
[03:14:42.443 --> 03:14:44.124]  I had LLBJ that didn't know that.
[03:14:44.364 --> 03:14:46.265]  I had John F. Kennedy who didn't know that.
[03:14:46.952 --> 03:14:48.853]  Please, tell me about our leaders.
[03:14:49.033 --> 03:14:50.853]  They didn't know that the Vietnamese never give up.
[03:14:52.034 --> 03:14:53.755]  Well, you're the only one who knew it.
[03:14:54.035 --> 03:14:54.515]  I knew that.
[03:14:54.955 --> 03:14:56.956]  But we had to learn it the hard way.
[03:14:56.996 --> 03:15:05.439]  We had to spend 55,000 men and a quarter of a million wounded in order to learn the lesson that Vietnam had nothing to do with our national interest.
[03:15:05.479 --> 03:15:06.839]  Great job, Dr. Pachinik.
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:07.500]  Talk to you soon.
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:07.920]  God bless.
[03:15:09.076 --> 03:15:10.277]  Thank you, and God bless you.
[03:15:38.154 --> 03:15:44.439]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[03:15:44.499 --> 03:15:45.580]  They know how the world really works.
[03:15:46.420 --> 03:15:48.922]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[03:15:48.982 --> 03:15:50.784]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[03:15:50.804 --> 03:15:57.649]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[03:15:58.830 --> 03:16:06.156]  But in full wars, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the CHICOMS, they want us shut down.
[03:16:07.142 --> 03:16:11.863]  Because, you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[03:16:12.123 --> 03:16:15.964]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[03:16:16.604 --> 03:16:25.666]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, so I know their larger game plan.
[03:16:25.786 --> 03:16:28.247]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[03:16:28.667 --> 03:16:30.927]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[03:16:31.608 --> 03:16:32.688]  And you've seen massive
[03:16:33.408 --> 03:16:35.369]  Corporate demonization and lies about us.
[03:16:35.469 --> 03:16:41.372]  You've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[03:16:42.072 --> 03:16:46.875]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[03:16:46.935 --> 03:16:50.937]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[03:16:53.658 --> 03:17:06.985]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high-quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and, of course, for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[03:17:07.585 --> 03:17:11.807]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[03:17:12.928 --> 03:17:18.410]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[03:17:18.690 --> 03:17:19.771]  Black Friday's coming early.
[03:17:20.655 --> 03:17:21.836]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[03:17:21.976 --> 03:17:26.300]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[03:17:26.881 --> 03:17:32.286]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[03:17:33.106 --> 03:17:40.633]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[03:17:41.514 --> 03:17:43.656]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:17:44.835 --> 03:17:51.278]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report.
[03:17:51.658 --> 03:17:54.819]  We came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[03:17:55.259 --> 03:17:58.161]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors.
[03:17:58.181 --> 03:17:59.961]  They wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[03:18:00.442 --> 03:18:03.623]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[03:18:04.243 --> 03:18:09.225]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsTore.com to even have credit card processing.
[03:18:09.245 --> 03:18:09.806]  But we've got it.
[03:18:09.846 --> 03:18:10.566]  We've got backups.
[03:18:10.966 --> 03:18:12.487]  But they're like a mafia targeting those.
[03:18:13.507 --> 03:18:14.708]  Get your X2.
[03:18:15.288 --> 03:18:17.689]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:19.931]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[03:18:20.291 --> 03:18:21.752]  Supramental Vitality, 50% off.
[03:18:22.452 --> 03:18:24.093]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[03:18:24.133 --> 03:18:26.494]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[03:18:26.815 --> 03:18:30.276]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[03:18:30.517 --> 03:18:30.637]  And
[03:18:31.457 --> 03:18:34.718]  Free shipping, store-wide, in FullerStore.com.
[03:18:34.878 --> 03:18:36.939]  This is Christmas in October.
[03:18:37.479 --> 03:18:45.041]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great, the five-star ratings, and go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts so that you have them.
[03:18:45.621 --> 03:18:46.481]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[03:18:46.501 --> 03:18:47.662]  Christmas is only two months away.
[03:18:48.482 --> 03:18:51.064]  And you can support me and Paul Warren while getting great products at Win-Win.
[03:18:51.364 --> 03:18:52.165]  I'm counting on you.
[03:18:52.205 --> 03:18:53.146]  You've always come through.
[03:18:53.586 --> 03:19:03.433]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability with a five-star rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[03:19:03.614 --> 03:19:06.516]  They want to shut down because we're successful and we expose them.
[03:19:06.696 --> 03:19:10.639]  And now is your chance more than ever to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.

[03:19:30.816 --> 03:19:32.937]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[03:19:41.169 --> 03:19:47.392]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:54.055 --> 03:19:59.137]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:03.428 --> 03:20:19.042]  Okay, Matt Bracken for the rest of the hour, and I'd like to first give a shout out to Dr. P. You know, it's a tough act to follow because the man is just, his knowledge of these affairs is encyclopedic, and I just learn by listening to him.
[03:20:19.462 --> 03:20:22.365]  I never want to see him go off, even when I'm coming on.
[03:20:23.061 --> 03:20:42.888]  But it reminds me when he was, they were talking, Alex and Dr. P were talking about the Leslie Stahl interview and what basic first level thinking she was showing there on the 60 Minutes interview, becoming preoccupied with the Khashoggi apparent murder.
[03:20:43.389 --> 03:20:45.089]  And I'm going to get to that in just a minute.
[03:20:45.650 --> 03:20:51.832]  But you can really see, and Dr. P brings this out so vividly, that
[03:20:53.360 --> 03:21:06.827]  Our president is operating at like a master 3D chess level and Lesley Stahl, right now when I'm picturing her, what I'm picturing is that NPC meme face over her.
[03:21:07.407 --> 03:21:13.310]  The non-player character role model from video games.
[03:21:14.110 --> 03:21:15.331]  She just doesn't get it.
[03:21:15.531 --> 03:21:17.732]  She's obviously being fed information
[03:21:18.777 --> 03:21:20.498]  That she doesn't understand anything about.
[03:21:20.578 --> 03:21:28.423]  She's fixating on things like, you know, one dead, you know, Saudi reporter and whether we're going to, you know, overturn the world order on this.
[03:21:29.164 --> 03:21:39.270]  When I'm sure if you asked her about that Wagner group, the 400 Russians that Mattis annihilated in Syria, she would probably just stare at you blankly.
[03:21:39.810 --> 03:21:48.216]  So whereas the average liberal and the average liberal reporter is operating on a first level thinking basis,
[03:21:48.993 --> 03:21:54.217]  Trump is acting on so many levels at the same time that they basically can't comprehend it.
[03:21:54.638 --> 03:21:58.120]  Yet, I think the average American voter understands.
[03:21:58.541 --> 03:22:05.166]  Trump is finally operating on the best interests of the United States of America.
[03:22:05.766 --> 03:22:10.970]  You know, Trump often said and says that our trade deals were stupid.
[03:22:11.771 --> 03:22:12.612]  And that's true.
[03:22:13.351 --> 03:22:21.157]  But I think he's avoiding saying something even harsher, which is that the Americans making these trade deals were sellouts.
[03:22:21.637 --> 03:22:29.823]  They're lining their own pockets by expediting the transfer of our technology and our factories to places like China.
[03:22:30.284 --> 03:22:39.771]  They don't give a damn about whether or not we make our own military gear in this country, or if we could surge up a military buildup in a wartime.
[03:22:40.091 --> 03:22:42.453]  They don't care, as long as they made their money.
[03:22:43.033 --> 03:22:43.633]  We're good.
[03:23:04.298 --> 03:23:08.159]  Not worrying so much about the enemies, we can take care of China and Russia.
[03:23:08.619 --> 03:23:11.220]  It's our friends, our backstabbing allies.
[03:23:11.780 --> 03:23:12.440]  That's harder.
[03:23:12.860 --> 03:23:21.302]  And Leslie Stahl, she's back on that first-level thinker, NPC meme face, saying, but aren't you being harsh?
[03:23:21.902 --> 03:23:23.763]  Isn't that being rough on our allies?
[03:23:23.783 --> 03:23:25.483]  I mean, she just doesn't get it.
[03:23:25.603 --> 03:23:29.444]  No wonder we constantly lose in this global poker game.
[03:23:29.844 --> 03:23:32.385]  We finally got a hard-nosed winner in charge.
[03:23:32.905 --> 03:23:35.386]  And the liberals, it just blows their mind.
[03:23:35.726 --> 03:23:40.129]  They can only see at the first level, oh, he's saying mean things to our allies.
[03:23:40.529 --> 03:23:41.909]  Yeah, but he's getting results.
[03:23:42.190 --> 03:23:45.091]  He wants NATO, for example, to pay its fair share.
[03:23:45.651 --> 03:23:46.512]  What's wrong with that?
[03:23:46.652 --> 03:23:52.474]  And you're not going to get there by, you know, speaking softly to them or shipping them plain loads of money.
[03:23:52.935 --> 03:23:54.195]  That's just not going to happen.
[03:23:55.356 --> 03:23:55.496]  Now,
[03:23:56.509 --> 03:24:00.271]  The big news today is obviously the Khashoggi thing, and I've been giving it a lot of thought.
[03:24:00.792 --> 03:24:11.038]  I've been reading everything I could get my hands on in the Internet, that is, and I found a really good Al Jazeera piece that keeps reloading.
[03:24:12.419 --> 03:24:17.702]  If you refresh it every half hour or so, it'll actually have the newer stuff at the top.
[03:24:18.242 --> 03:24:22.505]  And, you know, it's extremely informative, because this is really an important story.
[03:24:23.066 --> 03:24:25.069]  And maybe not for the reasons that people think.
[03:24:25.549 --> 03:24:31.679]  You know, my first impression of the Khashoggi hit is it's got to be the world's worst wet-up.
[03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:37.849]  You know, I mean, imagine sending a team of 15 assassins to one of your own consulates.
[03:24:38.672 --> 03:24:41.753]  Then killing an enemy of the state inside the consulate.
[03:24:42.133 --> 03:24:46.515]  This absolutely trashes the Saudi reputation worldwide.
[03:24:47.016 --> 03:24:53.038]  Who, that's not a stooge for the government, will ever willingly walk into a Saudi diplomatic mission?
[03:24:53.058 --> 03:24:55.079]  I mean, if it could be a kill box.
[03:24:55.699 --> 03:24:59.221]  So, it brings up the thought, who benefits?
[03:24:59.961 --> 03:25:00.901]  Why would you do this?
[03:25:01.582 --> 03:25:04.923]  Even the Saudis can't be that stupid, especially King Salman.
[03:25:05.757 --> 03:25:13.724]  Now, if you just wanted to kill the guy, the last thing you would do is lure him into a consulate where he's filmed going in but not out.
[03:25:13.944 --> 03:25:15.465]  Presumably not filmed going out.
[03:25:16.266 --> 03:25:30.798]  However, if you kill him, you know, in a, for example, an arranged traffic accident where he's run down crossing the street, or something like that, you know, poisoning his tea at the hotel, it might
[03:25:31.796 --> 03:25:35.137]  Look better than, you know, murdering him inside your own consulate.
[03:25:35.237 --> 03:25:37.958]  But on the other hand, then you don't get a chance to interrogate him.
[03:25:38.418 --> 03:25:40.178]  Now, who would want to interrogate him?
[03:25:40.739 --> 03:25:45.080]  Some of the best information that I've seen, there's a good article in Zero Hedge this morning about this.
[03:25:45.820 --> 03:25:53.942]  Some of the people that may have wanted to interrogate Khashoggi before killing him could be Saudis that had advanced knowledge of 9-11.
[03:25:54.803 --> 03:25:58.864]  Now, this is why you don't want to just run him over on the street in Istanbul.
[03:25:59.654 --> 03:26:06.658]  You want to know what he knows, and you also want to know maybe who he shared the information with, so you can go after them also.
[03:26:07.279 --> 03:26:21.528]  In terms of damage control, if during torture slash interrogation, he can demonstrate to you that it doesn't matter, he's got a failsafe switch, a dead man switch, so that if he doesn't come out, the information will be released.
[03:26:21.568 --> 03:26:23.549]  Well, that's worthwhile information in itself.
[03:26:24.406 --> 03:26:34.184]  But if the Saudi intel bosses that want this information, if they could be implicated in pre-knowledge of 9-11,
[03:26:35.586 --> 03:26:37.147]  Yeah, they might be willing to do it.
[03:26:37.227 --> 03:26:43.569]  Now, when you say a Saudi intel boss, that doesn't necessarily mean an ally of the king.
[03:26:43.950 --> 03:26:53.674]  Look at our own CIA, where Brennan was working for the deep state against President-elect Trump and then against President Trump in fact.
[03:26:54.134 --> 03:26:56.535]  You can have the same situation in Saudi Arabia.
[03:26:57.293 --> 03:27:00.154]  The country is in turmoil, even though there is a new king.
[03:27:00.174 --> 03:27:14.478]  It's virtually an underground civil war taking place, with much of the royal family arrested or exiled, and many of the people in place, their loyalty might be divided, or they might secretly be working against the king.
[03:27:14.498 --> 03:27:26.902]  So if you have a traitor intel boss who's on the surface, still working within the Saudi government, he would be able to possibly order this 15-man hit team to the consulate.
[03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:35.266]  Without the exact knowledge of the higher levels of the Saudi government that they were going to kill Khashoggi, then it's a win-win.
[03:27:35.386 --> 03:27:48.616]  If they interrogate him, the report gets back to the traitorous intel boss, indicating whether or not the fact that he had pre-knowledge of 9-11 will be reported or not.
[03:27:49.628 --> 03:27:52.770]  And if this damages King Salman, then it's a twofer.
[03:27:53.330 --> 03:28:01.595]  So you possibly help the enemies of the king, because this is just ruinous to Saudi Arabia's reputation.
[03:28:02.015 --> 03:28:04.797]  Pompeo's flying over there right now to read them the riot act.
[03:28:05.397 --> 03:28:10.360]  So this is a real viper's nest inside of Saudi Arabia.
[03:28:10.800 --> 03:28:15.303]  And by no means can you assume that if this had happened, it was ordered by the king.
[03:28:16.227 --> 03:28:23.150]  It can definitely be a rogue operation, in a sense, the way that Trump inarticulately put it this morning.
[03:28:24.430 --> 03:28:25.731]  And we'll be back in a little bit.
[03:28:26.671 --> 03:28:27.911]  We'll start taking calls.
[03:28:27.951 --> 03:28:30.012]  So if there are calls, we'll be taking them.
[03:28:43.519 --> 03:28:54.327]  Sheryl Sandberg, the representative from Facebook, literally sounds like the most authoritarian big brother, I call her big mother now, that I've ever heard.
[03:28:54.367 --> 03:29:02.172]  It was just so creepy to hear her talking about the tactics and how serious they are about trying to remove quote-unquote fake news.
[03:29:02.452 --> 03:29:11.859]  And what's interesting about these hearings is that these hearings are our own congressmen and women who have sold out to the globalists, primarily
[03:29:12.319 --> 03:29:29.475]  Mostly Democrats, but also Republicans, just like Marco Rubio, essentially pressuring social media big tech to do their bidding for them, acting as censors or authoritarian-type regimes and saying that if you don't, we'll take you over.
[03:29:30.176 --> 03:29:33.800]  We are focused, as I know you are, on the upcoming U.S.
[03:29:33.840 --> 03:29:35.922]  midterms and on elections around the world.
[03:29:37.170 --> 03:29:46.825]  Our efforts in recent elections from Germany to Italy to Mexico to the Alabama Special Senate election show us that the investments we are making are yielding results.
[03:29:47.313 --> 03:30:03.980]  Right there, she's admitting to the fact that social media plays a major role in our elections and she's actually talking about how in other countries they're using their tools, algorithms, AI, shadow banning, to influence elections in other countries.
[03:30:04.601 --> 03:30:16.546]  But don't worry, she's doing it on behalf of Big Brother, Big Authoritarian Government, and she'll take commands from the Democrat globalists that are in office.
[03:30:17.166 --> 03:30:19.528]  I mean, if that doesn't creep you out, I don't know what does, Alex.
[03:30:19.809 --> 03:30:25.474]  And it's in the WikiLeaks and everywhere else that they're interfacing with the executives in real time and taking bad Hillary results out, you name it.
[03:30:25.874 --> 03:30:32.400]  Any populist, any nationalist, they're all being removed and being force-fed from Brazil to Germany.
[03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:36.464]  They're trying to stop populist candidates, trying to stop the will of the people.
[03:30:36.504 --> 03:30:39.147]  This is truly an authoritarian group of criminals.
[03:30:39.187 --> 03:30:39.727]  Let's continue.
[03:30:39.867 --> 03:30:42.289]  We're getting better at finding and stopping our opponents.
[03:30:43.170 --> 03:30:48.054]  From financially motivated troll farms to sophisticated military intelligence operations.
[03:30:49.415 --> 03:30:52.377]  We don't have access to the intelligence government have access to.
[03:30:52.977 --> 03:30:56.460]  So we don't always know exactly who is behind these attacks or their motives.
[03:30:57.400 --> 03:31:00.303]  And that's why we will continue working closely with law enforcement.
[03:31:02.364 --> 03:31:04.726]  Chairman Burr, I want to thank you for your leadership.
[03:31:05.916 --> 03:31:12.978]  Vice Chairman Warner, I want to thank you for your white paper, which has so many ideas on how we can work together to strengthen our defense.
[03:31:12.998 --> 03:31:13.718]  Let's stop again.
[03:31:13.898 --> 03:31:26.742]  The fact that she's talking about how they're trying to prevent foreign interference in our elections, but she's demonstrating and talking about how they, Facebook, are taking it upon themselves to then meddle in elections.
[03:31:27.322 --> 03:31:36.128]  And give the result that our government officials in the Democrat Party or the globalist movers and shakers want them to make.
[03:31:36.588 --> 03:31:49.997]  So she's actually admitting that by preventing foreign interference from Russians or whatever else, she's going to take it upon herself as a Facebook executive to make sure that they get the results that the globalists want.
[03:31:50.357 --> 03:31:58.620]  We're also going to require people running large pages with large audiences in the United States to go through an authorization process and confirm their identity.
[03:31:58.961 --> 03:32:15.227]  Okay, so this is exactly what I said was going to happen when you had me on right after InfoWars and Alex Jones' YouTube and Facebook pages got pulled from my intelligence source that was saying that this is all the plan and they're going to roll out
[03:32:15.527 --> 03:32:17.608]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:51.824 --> 03:32:56.367]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:32:56.847 --> 03:32:58.348]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:32:59.148 --> 03:33:01.029]  Okay, Matt Bracken, I'm back for the rest of this hour.
[03:33:01.049 --> 03:33:01.730]  And the call-in number is 877-789-2539.
[03:33:01.750 --> 03:33:01.790]  877-789-2539.
[03:33:01.810 --> 03:33:03.011]  And we'll be taking calls in a bit.
[03:33:03.051 --> 03:33:04.031]  Yeah, to wrap up this Khashoggi thing,
[03:33:20.054 --> 03:33:28.337]  The novelist in me looks at this and just really marvels because it's got so many elements of a thriller or a spy movie.
[03:33:29.378 --> 03:33:36.561]  If everybody here, presumably, if you're watching this show, you've seen the movie with Gene Hackman called Enemy of the State.
[03:33:38.361 --> 03:33:42.183]  This involves somebody accidentally filming a hit.
[03:33:42.902 --> 03:33:48.186]  And then the flash drive, I believe, with the information on it, is passed to a friend.
[03:33:48.266 --> 03:33:50.487]  I believe that's Denzel Washington.
[03:33:51.268 --> 03:33:58.393]  And the next thing you know, the NSA is chasing after everybody that might have this damaging information.
[03:33:58.773 --> 03:34:10.881]  So in this case, you've got Khashoggi wearing an Apple Watch into the consulate, and it's synced up to record to the smartphone that is left outside, either with his fiancée or somebody else.
[03:34:12.583 --> 03:34:22.247]  Then the smartphone, maybe that gets handed to somebody else, or maybe it's the information is sent automatically in real time to the cloud somewhere.
[03:34:23.048 --> 03:34:36.594]  And we might in this, the two weeks since this happened, have this big chase for this information because it could conceivably have the voice of Khashoggi being tortured and murdered and possibly sawed up, if you can imagine.
[03:34:37.114 --> 03:34:41.236]  Now, if the Turks had it and they wanted to damage Saudi Arabia, they could release it.
[03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.692]  All right.
[03:34:46.872 --> 03:34:55.359]  The big actors, USA, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, they might all be trying to figure out who really did the hit and what does King Salman have to do with it.
[03:34:55.459 --> 03:35:02.805]  Because if it was a rogue element doing this to take down the king, they wouldn't want that to happen.
[03:35:03.125 --> 03:35:05.086]  But imagine what big stakes these are.
[03:35:05.146 --> 03:35:12.132]  Imagine you're like the friend of the fiancé and you're holding this smartphone right now with the images and the sounds on it.
[03:35:13.028 --> 03:35:19.473]  It would be a terrifying time running around Europe in the Middle East trying to stay one step ahead of how many?
[03:35:20.253 --> 03:35:26.858]  Intel agency assassins, it's it's right out of right out of a James Bond or a Tom Cruise movie.
[03:35:27.358 --> 03:35:36.424]  Yeah, it seriously is and maybe this is a lesson from this is don't look at the first level the first level is is
[03:35:37.179 --> 03:35:41.962]  You know, the bad, evil Saudis sent a hit team to kill this guy in the consulate.
[03:35:42.442 --> 03:35:43.263]  Maybe that's true.
[03:35:43.783 --> 03:35:47.085]  The Saudis are not known for having the highest national IQ.
[03:35:47.546 --> 03:35:52.929]  But seriously, would you do that when it's going to obviously blow back in your face?
[03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:56.071]  This is like pulling a pin on a grenade and holding it up to your chest.
[03:35:57.312 --> 03:35:59.133]  It's just so self-destructive.
[03:35:59.894 --> 03:36:01.214]  Maybe it happened that way.
[03:36:01.935 --> 03:36:03.396]  Maybe this is a Turkish play.
[03:36:03.736 --> 03:36:06.478]  Maybe the guy did get out and nobody has it on film.
[03:36:07.170 --> 03:36:14.794]  But I tend to think that he came out in a couple of suitcases and is never going to be found.
[03:36:14.834 --> 03:36:20.357]  He's probably fed the jackals in the desert somewhere on the flight back to Saudi Arabia.
[03:36:21.198 --> 03:36:23.179]  But it's a dirty business.
[03:36:23.299 --> 03:36:25.300]  But it's very interesting.
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:29.662]  And I'm going to be interested to see how this unfolds over the coming days.
[03:36:29.682 --> 03:36:32.344]  Well, Matt Bracken, we know how it's unfolding right now.
[03:36:32.884 --> 03:36:36.146]  The best thinking of my good sources, the Pentagon, even Steve McChenekish,
[03:36:36.866 --> 03:36:43.628]  Why would the Saudis do this at somebody else's embassy in Turkey, who they're basically in conflict with, with 15 guys?
[03:36:43.708 --> 03:36:45.648]  It's the worst place ever to kill somebody.
[03:36:46.269 --> 03:36:47.949]  It'd be perfect for a diplomatic crisis.
[03:36:47.969 --> 03:36:52.730]  It's just like Trump can't even run two or three levels deep his own White House with the leaks.
[03:36:53.231 --> 03:36:59.652]  And as you pointed out, the CIA, the Justice Department moles, the stay-behind networks that are there doing all this.
[03:37:00.032 --> 03:37:01.273]  Those are really, really great points.
[03:37:01.313 --> 03:37:02.013]  But here it is.
[03:37:02.473 --> 03:37:03.573]  This is coming out.
[03:37:03.613 --> 03:37:05.234]  The Washington Post, you name it, breaking.
[03:37:06.627 --> 03:37:16.295]  CNN reports Saudis, it is CNN, preparing to admit that Mr. Jamal Khashoggi was killed in an interrogation gone wrong.
[03:37:17.356 --> 03:37:29.706]  CNN reported on Monday, just minutes ago, that Saudi Arabia is preparing to report in which they admit that Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist who went missing earlier this year, was killed in an interrogation gone wrong.
[03:37:30.026 --> 03:37:31.548]  So see, how do they deny it?
[03:37:32.028 --> 03:37:35.331]  It's a rogue group in their own agency like the King and told Trump.
[03:37:36.536 --> 03:37:40.217]  Because, oh gee, that makes them look even weaker if they're not in control, see?
[03:37:40.798 --> 03:37:46.480]  A prominent Saudi dissident went missing after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2nd.
[03:37:46.900 --> 03:37:53.622]  Turkish officials said they have proof he was murdered and dismembered by a team of Saudi agents, a charge the Saudi government vehemently denied.
[03:37:54.102 --> 03:37:54.983]  But see, now they learn.
[03:37:55.023 --> 03:37:55.863]  No, it was your government.
[03:37:56.243 --> 03:37:57.744]  Per CNN, however, the Saudis
[03:37:58.677 --> 03:37:58.837]  I think?
[03:38:17.933 --> 03:38:23.095]  What was going on has exposed it, so they're actually confirming the rogue scenario.
[03:38:23.635 --> 03:38:34.118]  CNN's Arma Damon reported that Istanbul, that's Turkey, the report will be most likely conclude that operation was carried out without clearance and transparency and that those involved be held responsible.
[03:38:34.138 --> 03:38:36.419]  So we've got false flags being admitted here.
[03:38:37.539 --> 03:38:45.102]  Daman added that the Saudis report is still being prepared and could change, which who knows, means CNN's putting a spin that they admit it.
[03:38:45.973 --> 03:38:58.779]  But really the spin is that it was rogue, like we said, because Kibono, who benefits, fits into that to derail Trump's larger plan to stabilize the Middle East versus the globalist plan of destabilization.
[03:38:59.079 --> 03:39:09.184]  So you notice these provisos by CNN show them continually, just like on Trump's set to declassify evidence they were trying to set him up, he now has that leverage against him to make the deep state capitulate.
[03:39:09.204 --> 03:39:10.405]  But will they really capitulate?
[03:39:10.705 --> 03:39:12.126]  Instead they spin things like this.
[03:39:13.840 --> 03:39:26.685]  My question would still be, you know, even with this clarification, and it's very important, is what information did whoever ordered the 15 men, you know, somebody had to have pretty high-level clearance to order a 15-man team.
[03:39:27.245 --> 03:39:31.626]  Apparently, they cleared out the consulate, like, you know, an hour before Khashoggi arrives.
[03:39:32.147 --> 03:39:41.750]  So they have nobody but these 15 men in the consulate, you know, so that, presumably, so that the ladies at the front desk don't hear the screaming and aren't able to report it later.
[03:39:42.390 --> 03:39:44.371]  Yeah, I think it's what he knew.
[03:40:06.443 --> 03:40:13.856]  In terms of doing a snatch on the street with a van, you know, roll up in a carpet, that kind of, you know, the old standbys.
[03:40:16.349 --> 03:40:19.730]  Khashoggi is going to be a very hard person to capture that way.
[03:40:20.190 --> 03:40:25.432]  This is like trying to capture the, you know, the granddaddy jackrabbit that people have been hunting for for 20 years.
[03:40:25.492 --> 03:40:28.573]  I mean, you know, he's a guy who's wily.
[03:40:28.973 --> 03:40:30.814]  He knows all the tricks of the trade.
[03:40:30.834 --> 03:40:36.116]  He's been in and out of the intel community in terms of... He thinks he's meeting with his buddies.
[03:40:37.464 --> 03:40:45.046]  Or he really thinks that this is clear, he's gotten high-level assurances that he's good to go for the divorce papers.
[03:40:45.446 --> 03:40:46.906]  He can't get married without them.
[03:40:47.186 --> 03:41:01.190]  I think it's foolish for him to walk into any Saudi embassy or consulate, but it shows that whoever ordered the hit was very desperate to get what he had inside of his brain, no matter what it took, even to kill him and cause a huge flap like this.
[03:41:02.490 --> 03:41:14.874]  It tells me that if Khashoggi's planted the information in some kind of a fail-safe situation, where it's going to be disseminated after his death, then this could blow 9-11 wide open.
[03:41:14.914 --> 03:41:22.256]  Because a lot of people seem to believe that these high-level intel people, they knew about 9-11 gearing up.
[03:41:22.276 --> 03:41:26.597]  Maybe not the exact target, but they knew all about OBL and the teams in the USA.
[03:41:26.637 --> 03:41:30.418]  Sure, we know that's the leverage Trump's got over them to make Saudi Arabia capitulate.
[03:41:30.538 --> 03:41:37.606]  We'll be right back in the final segment with Matt Bragg and then the War Room fires up coming up in about 15 minutes at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:41:37.646 --> 03:41:41.490]  Remember, the globalists are working around the clock to shut this transmission down.
[03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:43.792]  They don't want uncontrolled debate.
[03:41:44.193 --> 03:41:45.054]  We don't have all the answers.
[03:41:45.074 --> 03:41:46.756]  We're having a real debate here, a real war game.
[03:41:47.216 --> 03:41:48.417]  We're trying to figure out what's going on.
[03:41:48.458 --> 03:41:51.061]  They want to put out a central message, have us repeat it.
[03:41:51.261 --> 03:41:51.481]  No.
[03:41:51.922 --> 03:41:53.343]  We're right about 95% of the time.
[03:41:53.363 --> 03:41:54.385]  We're wrong 5% of the time.
[03:41:54.765 --> 03:41:58.129]  Because we're trying to figure it all out, we question every angle.
[03:41:58.450 --> 03:42:00.772]  They then take that out of context and say we're doing horrible things.
[03:42:00.792 --> 03:42:01.093]  We're not.
[03:42:01.453 --> 03:42:05.138]  And finally, free shipping store-wide at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:42:45.577 --> 03:42:46.658]  I believe in you!

[03:42:53.203 --> 03:42:54.824]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:42:55.064 --> 03:42:57.506]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:42:57.626 --> 03:42:58.807]  And we're not backing down ever!

[03:43:02.495 --> 03:43:03.596]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:03.756 --> 03:43:04.237]  Can't you?
[03:43:04.497 --> 03:43:06.138]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:06.498 --> 03:43:07.439]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:07.459 --> 03:43:09.981]  Let's go!
[03:43:10.321 --> 03:43:12.303]  Come on!
[03:43:12.403 --> 03:43:13.984]  Come on!
[03:43:14.044 --> 03:43:14.604]  Come on!

[03:43:17.206 --> 03:43:17.807]  Come on!
[03:43:17.847 --> 03:43:18.227]  Come on!
[03:43:23.502 --> 03:43:25.244]  Vengeance is coming!

[03:43:27.946 --> 03:43:31.689]  The real revolution against you is coming!
[03:43:31.889 --> 03:43:40.937]  And you will burn in hell!
[03:43:42.338 --> 03:43:47.463]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[03:43:47.823 --> 03:43:49.925]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[03:43:51.869 --> 03:44:00.855]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts, like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:44:01.216 --> 03:44:07.440]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.

[03:44:13.184 --> 03:44:14.125]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:44:14.766 --> 03:44:16.608]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[03:44:16.969 --> 03:44:18.411]  Apple banned your app.
[03:44:18.571 --> 03:44:20.915]  I helped, too.
[03:44:20.995 --> 03:44:22.037]  Oh, Oliver.
[03:44:28.171 --> 03:44:30.353]  I hate free speech too!
[03:44:30.393 --> 03:44:32.716]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:32.816 --> 03:44:34.357]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:34.498 --> 03:44:35.739]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:35.879 --> 03:44:37.561]  We hate free speech!
[03:44:37.881 --> 03:44:42.926]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:44:43.067 --> 03:44:47.812]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega-Silver.
[03:44:48.012 --> 03:44:51.075]  That is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:44:51.275 --> 03:45:00.163]  It is super silver wound dressing gel, trademarked for first aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[03:45:00.364 --> 03:45:02.586]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:45:02.726 --> 03:45:04.728]  Some medical grade stores have it.
[03:45:04.908 --> 03:45:05.909]  It's just incredible.
[03:45:06.569 --> 03:45:07.650]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[03:45:07.730 --> 03:45:08.910]  This is next level.
[03:45:08.970 --> 03:45:10.531]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:45:11.051 --> 03:45:15.212]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:45:15.552 --> 03:45:19.954]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:45:20.074 --> 03:45:23.535]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:45:23.695 --> 03:45:24.956]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:45:25.116 --> 03:45:27.957]  I can tell you right now, my dad is a moral surgeon and dentist.
[03:45:28.297 --> 03:45:31.978]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[03:45:32.579 --> 03:45:36.980]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world and turned out their listeners.
[03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:42.142]  Inforestore.com, Inforestlife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:42.682 --> 03:45:49.185]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[03:45:49.725 --> 03:45:53.991]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[03:45:54.351 --> 03:45:54.852]  This is it.
[03:45:55.112 --> 03:45:57.515]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[03:45:57.635 --> 03:45:59.317]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[03:45:59.518 --> 03:46:00.118]  Nanotech.
[03:46:00.258 --> 03:46:04.083]  Super small particles which go in electromagnetically, just goes right in the heart of something.
[03:46:06.015 --> 03:46:20.910]  Our silver wound dressing gel contains the powerful silver saw technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver markets as the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind.
[03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:26.736]  This gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping
[03:46:27.076 --> 03:46:28.698]  Speed up the healing process.
[03:46:28.858 --> 03:46:31.060]  And that's the way I like it.
[03:46:31.140 --> 03:46:37.265]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now at Infowarslife.com.
[03:46:41.610 --> 03:46:44.272]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:02.261 --> 03:47:18.511]  Okay, you're back with Matt Bracken for the final segment, and we're going to go straight to calls now, and hear what people are thinking, not necessarily on Saudi Arabia, but anything.
[03:47:20.292 --> 03:47:24.655]  I see Jason in Canada says, going after the enemy at the top.
[03:47:25.135 --> 03:47:25.896]  Jason, are you there?
[03:47:28.297 --> 03:47:29.138]  Yeah, I'm here, Matt.
[03:47:29.858 --> 03:47:30.559]  Go ahead, Jason.
[03:47:32.079 --> 03:47:50.646]  Well, I just feel like, you know, with just summing up a lot of things that's happened over the years, the Islamic invasion, the anti-Islamic riots that are happening now and stuff, you know, just kind of like the setup for catastrophe that's happening around the world.
[03:47:51.246 --> 03:47:56.728]  And I'm just wondering, do you know, like, is there any plans to move on
[03:47:59.642 --> 03:48:15.768]  I don't know about that, but I think that everybody's waiting for the midterm election results.
[03:48:16.448 --> 03:48:21.350]  The left is already losing it over Kavanaugh being confirmed on the Supreme Court.
[03:48:21.980 --> 03:48:28.366]  They're talking about basically the giving up on the Constitution, that the Electoral College means there's no more democracy.
[03:48:28.966 --> 03:48:32.049]  So I think that we're going to move into a whole new stage after the midterms.
[03:48:32.089 --> 03:48:34.150]  But until then, we just have to wait and see.
[03:48:34.170 --> 03:48:40.056]  You know, if the Republicans hold the Senate and the Congress, the Democrats are going to lose their minds.
[03:48:41.517 --> 03:48:43.999]  Let's go to Ashley in Missouri.
[03:48:44.039 --> 03:48:46.861]  I want to take a lot of calls quickly because they're they're stacked up.
[03:48:47.522 --> 03:48:48.643]  Ashley in Missouri, go ahead.
[03:48:50.017 --> 03:48:51.918]  Yeah, Mr. Bracken, it's an honor to speak with you.
[03:48:52.278 --> 03:48:57.159]  You've been talking about this new platform that you're going to announce that's coming out.
[03:48:58.099 --> 03:49:10.182]  And in reference to that, I listened to an interview by Robert David Steele the other day on X-22 Report Spotlight, and he was talking about a new platform that's coming out also.
[03:49:10.523 --> 03:49:15.804]  And I was just wondering, is there any connection between what he's working on and what
[03:49:18.283 --> 03:49:31.969]  I'm not familiar with what Steele is working on, but I've been working on a platform called FreeZoxy.com, basically as an alternative to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.
[03:49:32.089 --> 03:49:44.555]  There's a link at the top of my Twitter feed if anybody's interested, but the basic rundown is we need more alternatives than just trying to post on liberal social media.
[03:49:45.471 --> 03:49:52.234]  There's an existing platform out there, Gab, which I've been on for two years, which has a lot of strong points.
[03:49:53.254 --> 03:49:56.456]  But it's not really a video hosting site either.
[03:49:56.476 --> 03:49:58.076]  It's sort of a Twitter clone.
[03:49:58.877 --> 03:50:05.359]  And we'll be trying to roll out more functions on FreeZoxy as time goes on.
[03:50:05.819 --> 03:50:09.101]  The point isn't that these are going to replace Facebook and Twitter tomorrow.
[03:50:09.521 --> 03:50:14.783]  But as censorship ratchets up and gets tighter and tighter on liberal social media,
[03:50:15.424 --> 03:50:19.245]  People should start thinking about alternate communications channels.
[03:50:19.745 --> 03:50:28.566]  The more that there are, the harder it will be for Big Brother to censor us, social network analyze us, track us, trace us.
[03:50:29.247 --> 03:50:30.987]  The more channels that are open, the better.
[03:50:31.847 --> 03:50:32.707]  I welcome them all.
[03:50:32.887 --> 03:50:37.248]  And FreeZoxy is one that I'm helping to start up.
[03:50:37.308 --> 03:50:40.989]  But I also recommend Gab and others.
[03:50:42.890 --> 03:50:46.171]  See, Brian in Washington talking back to Saudi Arabia.
[03:50:47.352 --> 03:50:48.072]  Brian, go ahead.
[03:50:48.092 --> 03:50:52.033]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:50:52.093 --> 03:50:52.533]  Great, thanks.
[03:50:52.553 --> 03:50:54.034]  I just want to say something real quick.
[03:50:54.594 --> 03:50:59.816]  I really hope that the supplements don't get blocked and that you guys keep selling them because they changed my life.
[03:51:00.476 --> 03:51:03.577]  I don't have no kidneys, I'm on dialysis, and all my levels have been great.
[03:51:03.617 --> 03:51:04.517]  I work out every day.
[03:51:04.537 --> 03:51:06.478]  I've gained almost 10 pounds of muscle, so just
[03:51:07.048 --> 03:51:07.868]  Thank you guys for that.
[03:51:07.908 --> 03:51:08.849]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:51:09.009 --> 03:51:19.434]  And my message the other day about putting God first and having Christ in our hearts, I thank Alex also, because after I sent that message to Alex, he touched on it for two days in a row.
[03:51:20.075 --> 03:51:21.015]  And I appreciate that.
[03:51:21.035 --> 03:51:25.938]  It just shows that if one person says something and speaks out, that the message could spread that easy.
[03:51:26.318 --> 03:51:32.241]  About Saudi Arabia, the minute I seen what happened and heard, I already knew it was a setup.
[03:51:32.785 --> 03:51:40.889]  I mean, they're not only trying to stop what Trump is doing in our country, but they're trying to stop it around the world, because globalism isn't just America.
[03:51:41.950 --> 03:51:50.895]  They're strapping down on all countries, and right now Trump has sparked an evolution, a revolution around the world, and everybody's seeing and hearing freedom, and they want it.
[03:51:50.935 --> 03:51:56.478]  They want freedom, they want liberties, and they don't want to be strapped down by these globalists and have everything cooking for them.
[03:51:56.992 --> 03:51:59.033]  And be under authoritarianship.
[03:52:00.194 --> 03:52:02.235]  That's a very good point.
[03:52:02.255 --> 03:52:03.436]  That's a very good point.
[03:52:05.537 --> 03:52:06.097]  That's a great point.
[03:52:06.117 --> 03:52:09.899]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[03:52:10.500 --> 03:52:16.323]  These people following him around the world to shut down his speech and his movement.
[03:52:17.483 --> 03:52:24.227]  I don't know if you've seen the interview with the Chinese... Sorry, I'm having a panic.
[03:52:24.527 --> 03:52:25.068]  The Chinese...
[03:52:26.377 --> 03:52:26.697]  I'm good.
[03:52:43.667 --> 03:52:48.148]  Every time this ambassador would answer the question, he would completely deny it.
[03:52:48.569 --> 03:52:52.070]  But when he'd start talking, his eyes would start blinking a lot.
[03:52:52.150 --> 03:52:53.470]  They'd start blinking super fast.
[03:52:53.530 --> 03:52:54.690]  His face would start twitching.
[03:52:55.150 --> 03:53:00.232]  And it was pretty miraculous to see this guy try to deny what China's doing.
[03:53:00.872 --> 03:53:04.573]  And, you know, he's representing China and getting hit with the hardball questions.
[03:53:05.133 --> 03:53:05.994]  Well, they're in a whole...
[03:53:08.442 --> 03:53:10.822]  Well, they're in a whole new world with President Trump.
[03:53:11.283 --> 03:53:28.846]  They're used to these Ivy League State Department walks that are basically squishes, and half of them are just setting up their post-government career by selling out our country with the payoff to come after retirement.
[03:53:29.246 --> 03:53:30.606]  And that's all ending with Trump.
[03:53:30.626 --> 03:53:33.126]  There's a new sheriff in town, that's for sure.
[03:53:34.487 --> 03:53:35.727]  Pastor Sam in Texas.
[03:53:36.414 --> 03:53:39.415]  We're going to talk about the Central American Guatemalan Caravan.
[03:53:39.975 --> 03:53:41.295]  Go ahead, Pastor Sam.
[03:53:43.075 --> 03:53:43.755]  Yes, Matt.
[03:53:43.815 --> 03:53:44.656]  You there?
[03:53:45.176 --> 03:53:45.896]  Yes, I'm here.
[03:53:46.496 --> 03:53:47.236]  Can you read?
[03:53:48.356 --> 03:53:49.157]  Yeah, loud and clear.
[03:53:49.197 --> 03:53:49.657]  Go ahead.
[03:53:50.437 --> 03:53:50.837]  Excellent.
[03:53:51.377 --> 03:53:57.138]  Yes, it's all over drugs today, even posting some older articles about Central American politics.
[03:53:58.118 --> 03:54:06.060]  Mike Pence just met with three Central American presidents last week talking about stemming the flow of migrants.
[03:54:06.656 --> 03:54:10.879]  And it seems like there are two contradictory messages going out.
[03:54:11.059 --> 03:54:16.303]  The caravan departing right after at the same time as the Vice President met with them.
[03:54:16.323 --> 03:54:18.965]  And I'd like to weigh in on that, but you first.
[03:54:19.005 --> 03:54:21.707]  You've probably snooped and pooped all through Central America.
[03:54:23.448 --> 03:54:25.689]  Yeah, you know, the key to this is Mexico.
[03:54:27.119 --> 03:54:36.447]  By them facilitating this passage of this caravan and just the illegal migrant trade in general, they're not acting as our friend.
[03:54:36.507 --> 03:54:37.127]  That's for sure.
[03:54:37.147 --> 03:54:38.288]  It's a very hostile act.
[03:54:39.009 --> 03:54:46.935]  And, you know, President Trump deals in real politic, and I hope that he just turns the screws back on Mexico where he can.
[03:54:47.856 --> 03:54:55.562]  You know, I remember all the way back, I believe it was in the Nixon era, when, or actually it was, oh gosh, when was this?
[03:54:56.215 --> 03:54:57.255]  I think Bush the first.
[03:54:58.056 --> 03:55:02.557]  They kidnapped an American DEA guy down in Mexico, the cartels did.
[03:55:03.317 --> 03:55:09.038]  And we knew that the Mexican government was wrapped up in this, you know, working with the cartels.
[03:55:09.879 --> 03:55:15.800]  They just clamped down on the border so hard that traffic was backed up, you know, 24 hours going into Mexico.
[03:55:16.200 --> 03:55:21.922]  They said, until we find out what happened to our DEA man, I think his name was Kiki Camarena,
[03:55:22.763 --> 03:55:24.504]  We're going to search every vehicle for an hour.
[03:55:24.824 --> 03:55:27.425]  And there are ways to apply the screws to Mexico.
[03:55:28.045 --> 03:55:39.190]  So just allowing them to have another big parade of Guatemalan immigrants straight to the border, all paid for ultimately with George Soros money, I don't think it should fly.
[03:55:39.230 --> 03:55:41.011]  I don't think that they should be allowed asylum.
[03:55:41.311 --> 03:55:42.832]  They're in Mexico.
[03:55:42.872 --> 03:55:45.713]  You don't just get to go wherever you want in the world and claim asylum.
[03:55:46.329 --> 03:55:50.734]  So I would I would be more forcible this time in rejecting them at the border.
[03:55:51.475 --> 03:55:55.619]  Make them, you know, if they're in California, make them report to Texas and send them back to California.
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:55:57.001]  Just don't play the game.
[03:55:57.642 --> 03:55:58.683]  You know, be rough.
[03:55:59.744 --> 03:56:00.365]  Let's see.
[03:56:00.885 --> 03:56:05.811]  I got James in Louisiana, China and Saudi Arabia.
[03:56:06.091 --> 03:56:06.752]  Go ahead, James.
[03:56:06.772 --> 03:56:07.593]  You've been on for a while.
[03:56:08.510 --> 03:56:09.611]  Yes sir, hi.
[03:56:09.831 --> 03:56:10.652]  Pleasure speaking.
[03:56:10.912 --> 03:56:20.301]  I've actually been deprived of the Info Wars kinda sorta because the app has been lagging tremendously and I can't find new links anywhere really.
[03:56:20.902 --> 03:56:22.664]  But to my point,
[03:56:23.760 --> 03:56:37.727]  This whole Saudi Arabian scuffle with the journalists, I really hope Trump is just pandering to the military complex and talking about not really wanting to withdraw the arms sales and stuff like that.
[03:56:38.087 --> 03:56:46.992]  Because I mean, come on now, that should be something that shouldn't be thought about cutting off.
[03:56:50.247 --> 03:56:57.432]  When you're talking about factories in the USA that are geared up years ahead of time to produce jets and things like that, it is a major disruption.
[03:56:57.932 --> 03:57:00.274]  And we don't even know the facts of this case yet.
[03:57:00.574 --> 03:57:06.938]  So to basically cause factories to be closed in the USA, people thrown out of work, I wouldn't go for that head fake.
[03:57:08.159 --> 03:57:08.920]  Not on what we know.
[03:57:08.940 --> 03:57:11.482]  Alright, thanks a lot everybody.
[03:57:12.242 --> 03:57:18.006]  We're going to be out of here and I'll see you the next time that I'm guest hosting or just guesting on InfoWars.
[03:57:18.866 --> 03:57:20.587]  And, uh, it's a great time to be alive.
[03:57:20.627 --> 03:57:21.988]  Well, let's wait for those midterms.
[03:57:22.569 --> 03:57:27.692]  We'll see you soon.
[03:57:28.353 --> 03:57:32.015]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[03:57:32.316 --> 03:57:35.738]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[03:57:36.098 --> 03:57:45.485]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double-blind FDA-cleared human ingestion toxicity
[03:57:46.125 --> 03:57:46.505]  ...study.
[03:57:46.805 --> 03:57:49.547]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[03:57:49.907 --> 03:57:54.869]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:57:54.929 --> 03:57:57.290]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:57:57.550 --> 03:58:02.212]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:58:02.232 --> 03:58:02.792]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:58:03.232 --> 03:58:07.013]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[03:58:07.233 --> 03:58:09.914]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[03:58:10.174 --> 03:58:13.475]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[03:58:13.855 --> 03:58:19.156]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[03:58:19.236 --> 03:58:23.377]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[03:58:24.237 --> 03:58:26.898]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[03:58:29.696 --> 03:58:32.959]  In fact, I thought about calling the Capitol Switchboard myself and going, Hello!
[03:58:33.479 --> 03:58:36.601]  My name's Alice, but I'm not gonna tell you who I am or where I am.
[03:58:36.982 --> 03:58:40.004]  Brett Kavanaugh gang-raped me with 14 elves.
[03:58:40.384 --> 03:58:42.486]  Yes, it was 49 years ago.
[03:58:42.606 --> 03:58:47.910]  And Brett Kavanaugh, he also flayed my skin and pulled my fingernails out with pliers.
[03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:51.333]  And then, he had an electric drill and he drilled my kneecaps.
[03:58:51.353 --> 03:58:53.114]  Yes, ma'am, we're very sorry.
[03:58:53.334 --> 03:58:54.215]  Now, this is anonymous.
[03:58:54.315 --> 03:58:55.936]  I'm not gonna tell you where or when.
[03:58:55.996 --> 03:58:57.057]  Just, okay?
[03:58:57.257 --> 03:58:58.218]  Kavanaugh's evil.
[03:58:58.338 --> 03:58:58.598]  Quick!
