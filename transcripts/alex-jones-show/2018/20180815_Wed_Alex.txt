[00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.361]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:34.543]  It's Wednesday, August 15th, and there's only 83 days until the 2018 midterm elections.
[00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:41.124]  Join us and together we can bring back America and send the liberal globalist order back to the depths from which it came.
[00:00:41.824 --> 00:00:42.604]  We are live.
[00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:45.105]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:49.526]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday transmission.
[00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:55.686]  Well, as everyone saw yesterday, or many people, InfoWars.com was taken down until about midnight.
[00:00:55.706 --> 00:00:56.566]  We got it back up.
[00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:13.110]  Simultaneously, mainstream media was celebrating that, and CNN, who is not just a fake news organization, but basically a disinformation organization trying to sabotage independent American media, engaging classic racketeering, they came out.
[00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:21.812]  And began badgering along with Media Matters and others run by George Soros for our Twitter account to be taken down.
[00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:27.674]  There's a giant boycott forming, saying that I called for assaults on the media with a battle rifle.
[00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:29.754]  There's no such quote.
[00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:31.514]  There is no such video.
[00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:39.636]  And in the New York Times, and in Market Watch, and the Guardian, they show none of the information.
[00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.036]  It is just blank.
[00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.877]  And they do the little refrigerator magnet game
[00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:48.959]  Where they take one word here, put quotes, another word here, put quotes.
[00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.944]  I mean, I could do the same thing to a Wall Street Journal article and then say the Wall Street Journal article, you know, is calling for bombing the Capitol.
[00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:57.986]  But it's not true.
[00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:00.508]  You could just make up whatever you want.
[00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:03.130]  It is absolutely next level.
[00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.133]  But not to be undone, CNN then went further.
[00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:13.718]  CNN article accuses Infowars of being complicit in domestic terrorism.
[00:02:14.824 --> 00:02:19.846]  They say, we are terrorists, we are, I mean, I want a lawsuit hands down on this.
[00:02:21.746 --> 00:02:33.550]  But they don't care, because they are funded by billions of dollars from the establishment, and they believe they're going to overthrow the country, and so they're going to overthrow the First Amendment, and so they think they're going to be able to defeat everybody.
[00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:43.534]  This is just an incredible time, and everybody's got to ask themselves, what are they planning next, that they would be this crazy?
[00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:52.999]  Now, according to the Twitter rules and all the rest of it, where we're still streaming video, what I said, according to their complaint, I get to appeal it.
[00:02:55.185 --> 00:03:03.947]  He's evil and bad, but then when Media Matters and CNN want to sit there and actually call for real events to happen, that's alright.
[00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:10.549]  This is the double standard that is taking place by these individuals, and it's very, very dangerous.
[00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.670]  And I'm not going to play the video for you that's on Media Matters, because they'll claim, even though Media Matters is showing it,
[00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:26.074]  They'll claim that I am re-invoking the threat, but only Media Matters even posted the video, and I don't say what they say I said on the video.
[00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:32.518]  So again, this is next-level deception, and we have to ask the big question.
[00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:38.092]  What is it they're planning where they're purging myself and so many others ahead of the midterms?
[00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:50.889]  And Facebook and Twitter are purging nationalist authors and spokespersons in Brazil and in Australia and in Germany and in England and in France.
[00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:53.259]  It's incredible.
[00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.481]  Look at that Media Matters article of your TV viewer.
[00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:56.621]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:03:57.001 --> 00:04:08.147]  It says, on Periscope, Alex Jones tells supporters to get their, then the quote, battle rifles, then they just add a made-up line, ready against Antifa, the mainstream media, and, quote, Chi-Com operatives.
[00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:09.188]  Totally made up!
[00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:11.269]  None of that's true.
[00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:12.390]  Not what I said.
[00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:25.754]  I said Antifa is doxing law enforcement and judges and Republican congressmen and women who've already been attacked and those people need to have security and need to have their firearms ready to protect themselves if a hit team of Antifa come in to try to kill you.
[00:04:26.074 --> 00:04:28.495]  Everyone has a right to say you're trying to come to kill me.
[00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:31.056]  I will be at my home and I will defensively protect myself.
[00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:37.178]  That was in a 20-minute talk about an Antifa video I played, that Tucker Carlson also played that same night.
[00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:38.258]  We played it here.
[00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.379]  So get that ready of them saying they're going to kill Trump, Antifa.
[00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:42.999]  And I said, folks, this is serious.
[00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:46.960]  If you're on their hit list, you need to be defensively prepared to protect yourself.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.781]  Then I went on to China, manipulating the election and the media.
[00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:53.322]  Then I went into Trump needs to take action legally against the censorship.
[00:04:53.842 --> 00:04:56.823]  That turns into use your battle rifle on the media?
[00:04:57.143 --> 00:04:57.984]  Totally made up!
[00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:58.904]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.924 --> 00:04:59.344]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:05.140]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:35.836]  Have you heard?
[00:05:36.297 --> 00:05:38.378]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[00:05:38.458 --> 00:05:39.759]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:40.960]  They're all censoring us.
[00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:47.225]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[00:05:47.545 --> 00:05:50.548]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:20.235]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.943 --> 00:06:38.544]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:41.607]  It is Wednesday, already the 15th day of August 2018.
[00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:47.852]  We're going to be here for the next four hours and in the War Room with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone are coming up.
[00:06:48.693 --> 00:07:04.546]  All right, we've got some of the biggest news ever on the secret pedophile ring front that we have exclusively in the last 20 plus years detailed exactly where they operate out of, where their capitals are, and what their end game is, and what the final
[00:07:06.172 --> 00:07:09.153]  subterranean basement to it is.
[00:07:09.293 --> 00:07:10.674]  It's not just sex with children.
[00:07:10.694 --> 00:07:13.034]  It is torturing them to death.
[00:07:13.635 --> 00:07:15.075]  And that's well known to law enforcement.
[00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:19.156]  We're going to be exposing the big secret coming up in the next segment.
[00:07:22.478 --> 00:07:35.102]  And we are going to be having the representative on who has helped spearhead the operation to expose all of this and gone through living hell to do it.
[00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:51.584]  The 301 Catholic priest, now co-conspirators in a un-executed indictment by the grand jury.
[00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:59.749]  301 in a mass-organized, decades-long, gang-raping operation of small children, boys and girls.
[00:08:02.423 --> 00:08:08.565]  I told the New York Times reporter a week and a half ago when she was here, I said, you guys keep backing the Clintons and Weinstein and all them.
[00:08:09.005 --> 00:08:11.406]  It's all going to come out the next month.
[00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:21.469]  Because I was told by a federal law enforcement source in Pennsylvania, three weeks ago, they said that Trump has green-lighted it at the local and federal level.
[00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:22.689]  They're backing people.
[00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.270]  They don't care how bad it gets.
[00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:26.211]  They are going to bring it all out.
[00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:28.991]  So.
[00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:35.236]  And I told everybody, I told everybody, it wasn't QAnon, it didn't exist then.
[00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:37.678]  We told you Trump was going to go after the pedophiles.
[00:08:38.258 --> 00:08:41.561]  We told you he was going to roll them all up in Epstein and the whole situation.
[00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.744]  We told you, Eric Prince told you, we got the WikiLeaks.
[00:08:46.344 --> 00:08:48.386]  They tried to distract off into Pizzagate.
[00:08:51.388 --> 00:08:52.809]  But it didn't work, did it?
[00:08:54.505 --> 00:09:00.150]  So how deep the sickening, wicked, evil rabbit hole goes when we come back in the next segment.
[00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:06.616]  And then the state rep at the entire expose is going to be joining us.
[00:09:06.636 --> 00:09:07.817]  But this ties into Penn State.
[00:09:08.398 --> 00:09:09.419]  It ties into Sandusky.
[00:09:09.459 --> 00:09:11.440]  It ties into the higher levels of the FBI.
[00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:14.043]  It ties into Mueller.
[00:09:14.483 --> 00:09:18.647]  It ties into the FBI director before him who was sent in for the cover up of Penn State.
[00:09:19.187 --> 00:09:20.549]  It goes to the head of Penn State.
[00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:28.534]  Uh, who's now been indicted for cover-ups, and it goes right through to the richest families on the East Coast.
[00:09:29.274 --> 00:09:32.396]  Pennsylvania is the pedophile command base on the East Coast.
[00:09:32.957 --> 00:09:37.259]  Los Angeles and San Francisco are the pedophilic command base on the West Coast.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.461]  And it is a club.
[00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:50.378]  You know, in the Hell's Angels, you pretty much had to be a military veteran, already killed a bunch of people, and been trustworthy, and can ride a motorcycle blindfolded, you know, for a mile down the road.
[00:09:50.738 --> 00:09:51.158]  Seriously.
[00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:52.939]  That's how you become a Hell's Angel.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:04.863]  But to be in the globalist club, you've got to be into having sex with children, and then to get in the real club, you've got to be into torturing them and murdering them.
[00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:06.877]  And that is a fact.
[00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:15.549]  And it's all come out in Europe, it's all come out in England, it's all come out here, and it gets covered up because it's so horrible, and it's how they control things.
[00:10:15.569 --> 00:10:16.791]  So that's all coming up.
[00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.716]  Then, CNN, MSNBC, Media Matters,
[00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.188]  They've all gone next level defaming me.
[00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:27.209]  CNN now says officially that I'm complicit.
[00:10:27.249 --> 00:10:27.749]  This is a quote.
[00:10:27.889 --> 00:10:30.570]  Complicit in domestic terror and am a terrorist.
[00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:32.251]  Planning terror attacks.
[00:10:32.771 --> 00:10:34.672]  No proof, no links, no nothing.
[00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:37.233]  1000% you would win a defamation case.
[00:10:39.174 --> 00:10:41.254]  That just shows they don't think there's going to even be a country soon.
[00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:42.235]  I think we're all going to be arrested.
[00:10:42.255 --> 00:10:43.775]  They're going for full martial law.
[00:10:43.855 --> 00:10:44.636]  They don't act like this.
[00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:45.496]  My lawyers have agreed.
[00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:47.797]  You don't act like this unless you think you're taking over.
[00:10:49.908 --> 00:10:51.529]  CNN is everywhere saying take me off.
[00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.872]  Then they say that I said I want to use battle rifles on the media.
[00:10:55.012 --> 00:10:55.472]  No clip.
[00:10:55.733 --> 00:10:56.313]  No video.
[00:10:56.393 --> 00:10:56.913]  None of it's true.
[00:10:57.774 --> 00:10:58.795]  So they suspended our Twitter.
[00:10:58.835 --> 00:10:59.415]  Total hoax.
[00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:01.537]  The InfoWars was down yesterday.
[00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:02.157]  You know about that.
[00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:12.145]  Looks like we had denial of service going on for weeks but looks like somebody inside flipped a switch at one of the servers and we're not going to really get into how that happened.
[00:11:12.165 --> 00:11:15.828]  They don't want us to and we're looking at some holes and things but they aren't really there.
[00:11:15.868 --> 00:11:17.769]  It's mainly inside stuff.
[00:11:20.595 --> 00:11:25.001]  That's the sabotage going on with some other companies trying to take down from us right now.
[00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:29.507]  Akamai, we've been on for years for our video streamings, paid millions of dollars.
[00:11:30.208 --> 00:11:31.550]  Their employees want us turned off.
[00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.652]  We've had some stuff going on over there.
[00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:35.275]  And you know, I'm almost to the point like,
[00:11:37.045 --> 00:11:38.507]  Okay, I'll just get out of that contract with you.
[00:11:38.527 --> 00:11:45.794]  There's 20 other companies I can go to, but this just shows where won't-sell-us bandwidth, ladies and gentlemen, but the CEO's sticking with us.
[00:11:46.094 --> 00:11:46.655]  How nice.
[00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:54.743]  Wow, to know your employees hate me, but you're sticking with me because they've created all this hysteria that I'm this bad guy and I've paid you millions of dollars.
[00:11:55.524 --> 00:11:56.965]  Millions and millions and millions of dollars.
[00:11:57.986 --> 00:12:00.229]  And the left treats us like this in this country.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:18.688]  And we've known for a while they don't like us, and I could get into that whole other subject about what it's like when the left is over you and the kind of service you get, and the deals you get, and the quality you get, and the functions that are there, but sorry, you can't have those functions everybody else gets, because I'm the ball-headed stepchild, folks.
[00:12:21.429 --> 00:12:23.130]  That's the whole discrimination of the left.
[00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:27.852]  It's how they operate, it's what they do, it's all about ganging up on people.
[00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:33.771]  Oh, I'm the guy that questioned Sandy Hook when everybody else was questioning it.
[00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:37.332]  And then they misrepresent what I ever said, so I'm a bad person.
[00:12:37.372 --> 00:12:41.613]  But meanwhile, the left, the New York Times, the Washington Post, they all know about the pedophile rings.
[00:12:41.653 --> 00:12:42.933]  They know what runs the whole deal.
[00:12:43.353 --> 00:12:51.315]  They know that you've got all these globalists going to Aleister Crowley events, and they bring kids to them, where they simulate human sacrifice, and they put it on the New York Times.
[00:12:53.325 --> 00:13:01.147]  Videos of seven-year-old little girls looking at people in vats of blood and they come up and dip their little dipper in it and simulate eating blood, spirit cooking.
[00:13:01.387 --> 00:13:03.288]  That's just what they put on TV now.
[00:13:05.348 --> 00:13:10.870]  Pulp fiction, you know, where they kidnap the men and are raping them and got a sex slave in a box.
[00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:14.030]  They're just giving you an idea of what's going on.
[00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:15.791]  The tip of the iceberg.
[00:13:17.151 --> 00:13:19.752]  I told you, it's all coming up.
[00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:24.649]  James Gunn likes to host to catch-a-predator parties.
[00:13:24.669 --> 00:13:28.651]  You may have seen it before in Clockwork Orange.
[00:13:28.671 --> 00:13:31.533]  You may have seen some of the stuff before in The Shining.
[00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:33.814]  The iconography.
[00:13:34.515 --> 00:13:40.779]  There he is as a Catholic priest with women dressed up like little girls with little dolls and little clowns.
[00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:43.020]  Isn't that sweet?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:51.145]  And then he hosted parties and events with convicted pedophiles that filmed special types of videos.
[00:13:54.628 --> 00:13:55.689]  So that's all coming up.
[00:13:57.131 --> 00:13:58.793]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:10.145]  But the enemy is not letting up, and we need major infusions of capital if we're going to win this fight, and we are the tip of the spear.

[00:15:21.942 --> 00:15:27.405]  Or they sell for $50 watered-down synthetic stuff, you know, that has one-tenth as much PQQ or CoQ10 in it.
[00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:30.327]  We put in a giant horse dose.

[00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:24.554]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:18:26.014 --> 00:18:29.319]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space.
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.946]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:18:34.127 --> 00:18:38.193]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[00:18:38.936 --> 00:18:40.337]  Well, the society unravels.
[00:18:40.697 --> 00:18:45.479]  Men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[00:18:45.739 --> 00:18:51.902]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[00:18:52.242 --> 00:18:53.842]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[00:18:54.263 --> 00:18:55.063]  It's fulfilling.
[00:18:55.263 --> 00:18:55.963]  InfoWars.
[00:18:56.363 --> 00:18:57.224]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:18:57.544 --> 00:18:57.984]  Today.
[00:18:58.684 --> 00:19:00.665]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:01.085]  Go ahead.
[00:19:01.366 --> 00:19:03.547]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:06.608]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:07.452 --> 00:19:08.513]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:08.873 --> 00:19:10.575]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:11.295 --> 00:19:13.377]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:13.617 --> 00:19:17.601]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:17.621 --> 00:19:20.123]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:20.944 --> 00:19:23.265]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:23.626 --> 00:19:24.727]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:24.987 --> 00:19:25.868]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:26.108 --> 00:19:27.129]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:28.609]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:28.649 --> 00:19:29.710]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.570]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:36.192]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:36.512 --> 00:19:40.794]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:43.895]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:44.535]  You understand?
[00:19:44.615 --> 00:19:45.895]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:46.255 --> 00:19:47.436]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:53.298]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:19:54.278 --> 00:19:54.958]  Do you understand?
[00:19:54.978 --> 00:19:56.159]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:20:04.272 --> 00:20:07.014]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:20.885]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:23.166 --> 00:20:28.791]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:44.332 --> 00:21:03.326]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars and yours truly is on record 20 plus years ago exposing that sex crimes against children and other crimes against children is the glue that holds together secret societies in the West.
[00:21:04.537 --> 00:21:12.722]  And that it is the undercurrent of true evil that has been festering and breeding for hundreds and hundreds of years.
[00:21:14.844 --> 00:21:18.386]  And it's not just the stuff of old wives' tales, it's the stuff of history.
[00:21:19.206 --> 00:21:30.334]  And every time the media tries to tell you that Satanism, or child sex slavery, or child sex torture doesn't exist, you can better believe it is exploding.
[00:21:31.434 --> 00:21:33.756]  Now, let me break this down.
[00:21:35.455 --> 00:21:43.840]  The way they compromise people and take over universities, religious institutions, governmental institutions, is through secret societies.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:55.246]  And going back 500 years ago in Europe, if you wanted to get somebody in a secret society, you would offer them extracurricular sex, outside marriage, something you could be executed for by the church.
[00:21:56.874 --> 00:22:16.808]  And a lot of times it was members of the church that were putting on another mask, literally, like eyes wide shut, and playing the part of the secret society to control both the church and the confession to know what's going on in the town, or the city, or the hamlet, but also then the secret society knowing what's going on in the criminal underworld.
[00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:30.228]  That went from the extremes of robbers and pickpockets and, you know, roadside highwaymen, hijackers, right into child molesters, devil worshippers, human sacrificers.
[00:22:30.688 --> 00:22:32.930]  I mean, it's the whole nine yards.
[00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.631]  And it's the way human society organizes itself.
[00:22:36.111 --> 00:22:37.952]  Every culture had human sacrifice.
[00:22:38.733 --> 00:22:40.454]  In every continent, in every area.
[00:22:40.494 --> 00:22:41.374]  The Africans had it.
[00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:42.955]  The ancient Europeans had it.
[00:22:43.255 --> 00:22:44.676]  The ancient Babylonians had it.
[00:22:45.437 --> 00:22:46.097]  Every culture.
[00:22:50.273 --> 00:22:52.074]  This is, this is how they operate.
[00:22:53.075 --> 00:23:04.323]  And so, now you see 301 Catholic priests named in a grand jury indictment that's been prepared.
[00:23:04.363 --> 00:23:05.443]  They haven't filed it yet.
[00:23:06.524 --> 00:23:08.966]  And the media's like, will they even go to jail?
[00:23:08.986 --> 00:23:16.711]  Because see, they'll talk if any of the 301, if all about the 300 from Sparta,
[00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:24.290]  This is the real 301 monsters.
[00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:30.834]  And you've got the Deputy Pope from Australia in a secret trial right now, over 100 kidnapped children, some of them that disappeared.
[00:23:31.134 --> 00:23:36.498]  You've got the other big cardinal here in the U.S., who's now had to step down and is being indicted.
[00:23:36.518 --> 00:23:42.041]  And then you've got a separate area of the country, and this is going on.
[00:23:44.858 --> 00:23:49.301]  Now I've always told you, Pennsylvania is the capital of East Coast elitism.
[00:23:49.321 --> 00:23:51.322]  It's where the DuPonts are based.
[00:23:54.864 --> 00:23:55.184]  All of it.
[00:23:56.325 --> 00:24:00.907]  And I know folks that have grown up there in some of the wealthy areas and they tell me it is Satanism.
[00:24:01.768 --> 00:24:03.989]  It is all the things you can imagine.
[00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:06.489]  And that's just the reports.
[00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:08.750]  And they keep coming out and keep being proven true.
[00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:15.411]  So Sandusky would have sex with 10-year-olds inside the field house in the middle of the day in front of people in the shower.
[00:24:15.431 --> 00:24:19.652]  Because see, the real power of these people is to do it out in the open.
[00:24:20.012 --> 00:24:21.152]  They call that lesser magic.
[00:24:21.392 --> 00:24:22.733]  So that adds to the ritual.
[00:24:23.033 --> 00:24:25.333]  And the ritual is stealing the essence of the child.
[00:24:25.873 --> 00:24:29.494]  Stealing their innocence.
[00:24:29.934 --> 00:24:32.655]  And I'm going to explain the process from their
[00:24:35.109 --> 00:24:37.530]  alchemical view and the ritual they're conducting.
[00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.151]  Because this is black magic of the worst order.
[00:24:40.991 --> 00:24:46.953]  And it comes out in the law enforcement areas, but it always gets suppressed.
[00:24:47.013 --> 00:24:48.233]  But this is what's going on.
[00:24:48.253 --> 00:24:55.355]  So I told you, and look at that nightmare face.
[00:24:55.535 --> 00:24:58.096]  Look at what, if you're watching on TV, what Sandusky looked like.
[00:24:58.936 --> 00:25:04.358]  Got that same look of folks like the subway pedo.
[00:25:05.939 --> 00:25:06.659]  Like all the others.
[00:25:06.719 --> 00:25:07.520]  He's got the look.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.761]  He's got that look like Epstein.
[00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:10.441]  It's a look.
[00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:12.662]  We're gonna get more to that in a moment.
[00:25:14.523 --> 00:25:15.264]  So, U.S.
[00:25:15.324 --> 00:25:18.825]  Cardinal steps down amid widening sex scandal abuse.
[00:25:19.206 --> 00:25:20.666]  301 predator priests named in P.A.
[00:25:20.686 --> 00:25:22.167]  grand jury sex report.
[00:25:22.527 --> 00:25:24.368]  They were raping little boys and girls.
[00:25:25.149 --> 00:25:28.250]  State reps leading the investigation say it's much bigger than just the Catholic Church.
[00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:29.891]  That's only one arm of it.
[00:25:30.131 --> 00:25:31.312]  But they're trying to cover that up.
[00:25:32.212 --> 00:25:33.733]  We have that rep coming on to talk about it.
[00:25:35.575 --> 00:25:37.717]  So, this is all coming out.
[00:25:38.557 --> 00:25:39.658]  This is all unfolding.
[00:25:40.659 --> 00:25:42.200]  But I want to explain how this works.
[00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:52.748]  And I came up with this term because it's the types I've seen, and in the research I've done, there are people that have been seriously abused and tortured, and those are kind of like zombies.
[00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:58.604]  You know, that just kind of wander around and do whatever they're told and have little weird, odd jobs.
[00:25:59.404 --> 00:26:02.787]  And then you've got what I call the Renfields, who've been traumatized.
[00:26:03.287 --> 00:26:07.290]  And they like to have sex with children because they think that's love, because they were raped as children.
[00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.510]  Those are the Renfields.
[00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:10.332]  And then you've got the Draculas.
[00:26:10.372 --> 00:26:17.957]  And I don't mean they're literally Dracula that lives forever, but they dress in Dracula-type outfits, whether it be a priest outfit or an actual Dracula outfit.
[00:26:18.717 --> 00:26:22.920]  Whoever leads the ritual, abusing children, dresses like Dracula.
[00:26:24.119 --> 00:26:26.260]  And can we put James Gunn's own photos up, please?
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:36.665]  Of his pedophilic-themed parties, where he said in his own words, he is obsessed with sex with children, and they simulate sex with children, and then he works with convicted pedophiles.
[00:26:38.606 --> 00:26:40.827]  And there, he's dressed as a Catholic priest.
[00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:47.671]  Right there, but if you look closer at some of the other photos, he's actually got white makeup on, and black eyeliner.
[00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:49.572]  He's actually a vampire.
[00:26:50.472 --> 00:26:51.433]  Sucking soul.
[00:26:51.793 --> 00:26:52.773]  This is what they believe.
[00:26:55.031 --> 00:26:58.673]  And this is the whole giant cult that is all around you.
[00:26:58.693 --> 00:27:01.935]  I mean, there are millions of adherents to this in the U.S.
[00:27:01.955 --> 00:27:03.236]  They're in power positions everywhere.
[00:27:03.256 --> 00:27:05.897]  And there are people in government that know it who are fighting them as well.
[00:27:08.699 --> 00:27:11.040]  So, let's continue.
[00:27:15.343 --> 00:27:19.665]  Sandusky would have sex with children inside the locker room in front of people.
[00:27:22.047 --> 00:27:22.607]  Penn State.
[00:27:24.144 --> 00:27:24.324]  Yes.
[00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:39.131]  And you're asking why is it coming out now?
[00:27:39.171 --> 00:27:43.192]  Because Trump has greenlighted going after everyone to state, local, and federal.
[00:27:43.592 --> 00:27:48.114]  And we've seen a tenfold increase since Trump got elected of these pedophile rings.
[00:27:48.714 --> 00:27:50.555]  Actually with kids in cages, you name it.
[00:27:50.575 --> 00:27:53.556]  Remember the KTLA story back in February 2017?
[00:27:53.916 --> 00:28:01.639]  Where hundreds of pedophiles were arrested, reported pedophiles, alleged pedophiles, including women and children in cages?
[00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:03.360]  And the videos?
[00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:05.641]  The sex crime videos?
[00:28:06.081 --> 00:28:06.541]  The torture?
[00:28:09.224 --> 00:28:21.211]  There it is, 474 arrested, 28 sexually exploited children rescued during statewide human trafficking operation, LASD.
[00:28:21.531 --> 00:28:23.773]  But you never heard about it again, and where's the trials?
[00:28:24.053 --> 00:28:25.874]  It all gets killed above that.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.961]  There's a real move against this, and this is how the country's blackmailed, it's how it's controlled.
[00:28:33.782 --> 00:28:45.886]  But remember, Sandusky ran an abused children's shelter and group, where they'd bring in kids that had already been raped, and then quote, celebrities would come and visit with the children to comfort them in private homes overnight.
[00:28:46.926 --> 00:28:50.647]  And that's what Penn State was running, was a giant pedophile hotel.
[00:28:51.548 --> 00:28:57.530]  And it's all gonna come out, and let me tell you, a large percentage of the government are pedophiles and devil worshippers.
[00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:13.267]  Make no mistake, we're all living in one of the most important times in human history as populist and nationalist.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:20.201]  The pro-free market forces reawaken and ignite in our darkest hour and see success everywhere.
[00:29:20.921 --> 00:29:38.785]  And we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Dinesh D'Souza, the second highest grossing documentary filmmaker in history, best-selling author, and for that, falsely imprisoned, as the president has pointed out, announcing his pardon yesterday for a nine-month false prison sentence for getting five friends to donate.
[00:29:38.825 --> 00:29:41.185]  Hillary, again, billions of dollars, hundreds of millions.
[00:29:41.385 --> 00:29:47.407]  You know, I think, Alex, that when we hear words like dangerous from CNN, we have to learn to decode or translate what they actually mean.
[00:29:47.427 --> 00:29:48.948]  So what they mean is that Mark Rich
[00:30:07.114 --> 00:30:12.037]  Uh, no matter whether he's an arms dealer or a drug trafficker, he's not dangerous to them.
[00:30:12.618 --> 00:30:23.764]  In fact, he's on their side in the sense that he is willing to lavish billions of dollars, I mean, not millions, but tens of millions of dollars into progressive and left-wing causes.
[00:30:24.824 --> 00:30:26.525]  I actually am dangerous to them.
[00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:27.365]  Why?
[00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:31.707]  Because I'm actually out there undermining their ideology at every turn.
[00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:35.828]  And so to pardon me is to unleash me in an even bigger way.
[00:30:35.848 --> 00:30:44.992]  So when I hear these kinds of things from CNN, far from like trying to refute them, I essentially look behind the curtain and I go, I know why you're saying that.
[00:30:45.032 --> 00:30:46.453]  And in a certain sense, you're right.
[00:30:46.613 --> 00:30:47.293]  Incredible.
[00:30:47.613 --> 00:30:51.514]  And of course, the word is that the president's told you that he wants to unleash you.
[00:30:51.534 --> 00:30:52.675]  Can you talk about that?
[00:30:54.073 --> 00:31:04.036]  Yeah, I was in my study two days ago, working away, and the phone rang, you know, unknown caller, and I picked it up, and it was the White House operator.
[00:31:04.056 --> 00:31:22.862]  She just goes, she confirmed it was me, hold the line for the President of the United States, and Trump comes on, and the first thing he said to me was, hey Dinesh, you know, I'm sitting here with John Kelly, Chief of Staff, and we both want to let you know that we think that you're a great voice for freedom and for America,
[00:31:23.802 --> 00:31:29.467]  And he said, I gotta tell you man to man that, you know, your case, you know, you got screwed.
[00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:38.554]  He goes, you should have gotten it, it was a technicality, you should have gotten a fine and move on with life, but no, these guys went after you with everything they got.
[00:31:39.154 --> 00:31:41.016]  And he goes, it was a terrible injustice.
[00:31:41.056 --> 00:31:44.059]  He goes, the good thing is, you know, I'm in a position to correct it.
[00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:46.982]  So I want to, I want to clear your slate.
[00:31:47.002 --> 00:31:49.144]  I'm going to give you a full pardon tomorrow morning.
[00:31:49.164 --> 00:31:54.930]  And I am just, I want you to go out there and just do what you're doing at an even bigger scale than ever.
[00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:04.672]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:32:04.712 --> 00:32:06.173]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:32:06.213 --> 00:32:06.594]  Go ahead.
[00:32:06.694 --> 00:32:06.954]  Yes.
[00:32:07.414 --> 00:32:08.135]  Hi, Alex.
[00:32:08.235 --> 00:32:14.440]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.623]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:32:18.864 --> 00:32:20.305]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:32:20.445 --> 00:32:27.391]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[00:32:27.451 --> 00:32:30.313]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:32:31.194 --> 00:32:35.897]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:32:35.937 --> 00:32:43.763]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:32:43.783 --> 00:32:49.607]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:32:49.747 --> 00:32:55.051]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:32:55.151 --> 00:32:58.133]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[00:33:03.738 --> 00:33:17.644]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.406 --> 00:33:24.487]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:30.189]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:34.863 --> 00:33:55.591]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[00:33:56.411 --> 00:34:00.712]  Got a long line of heartache, I carry it well.
[00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:08.840]  The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell.
[00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:16.927]  Bad luck wind been blowing at my back.
[00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:24.713]  I pray you don't look at me, I pray I don't look back.
[00:34:25.153 --> 00:34:26.394]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:34:26.434 --> 00:34:33.520]  We're going into the rabbit hole, where millions of little innocent children every year get brutally raped,
[00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:50.600]  And then tortured, and in some cases killed, and disappeared after unspeakably horrible things are done to them by the entities that possess those carrying out the operations.
[00:34:52.681 --> 00:35:00.645]  And then there's the little servant types that just mimic it, kind of the court gestures of the whole system, but behind them
[00:35:03.536 --> 00:35:06.238]  Are the real initiates of the dark arts.
[00:35:07.298 --> 00:35:07.999]  So, let's go back.
[00:35:08.679 --> 00:35:11.541]  Penn State's president has been indicted for covering it up.
[00:35:12.861 --> 00:35:13.742]  That was a couple years ago.
[00:35:13.762 --> 00:35:14.582]  Where'd that trial go?
[00:35:15.863 --> 00:35:26.989]  You have a 301 priest, basically almost all the priests in the state, Catholic priests, raping little boys and little girls and torturing them in some cases.
[00:35:27.209 --> 00:35:27.810]  It's all torture.
[00:35:28.757 --> 00:35:29.558]  Other types of torture.
[00:35:30.098 --> 00:35:32.320]  And you have government knowingly covering it up.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.303]  And then you've got other cardinals having to step down for covering it up in other states.
[00:35:38.144 --> 00:35:40.907]  And again, if you look it up, Sandusky is the standard model.
[00:35:40.927 --> 00:35:45.190]  They'll have an operation for abused children who've been sexually abused.
[00:35:46.071 --> 00:35:46.811]  Ages 5 to 15.
[00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:55.258]  Then they have houses that Penn State ran, that Sandusky ran as foundation.
[00:35:56.786 --> 00:35:59.928]  And they would get movie stars and all these nice people involved.
[00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:03.770]  Show Sandusky's mugshot with those shark teeth.
[00:36:06.312 --> 00:36:08.493]  Or Sandusky smiling, show that.
[00:36:08.513 --> 00:36:11.155]  He has his house right behind the local public schoolyard.
[00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:12.696]  Kind of look at the prey.
[00:36:12.716 --> 00:36:15.517]  And there's all different ways to do this.
[00:36:15.537 --> 00:36:18.679]  There's some parents that get paid to have their kids have sex with these people.
[00:36:21.061 --> 00:36:22.722]  There's others where they kidnap kids.
[00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:25.174]  They use other children to lure them.
[00:36:25.875 --> 00:36:27.376]  There's a mix of things that go on.
[00:36:28.637 --> 00:36:37.366]  But Sandusky and his son, now convicted, they're all involved in this.
[00:36:39.287 --> 00:36:48.116]  And thousands of children who'd been neglected and sexually abused from around the country, whatever you wanted to order,
[00:36:50.509 --> 00:37:04.420]  Would then be flown to Penn State to meet the football team, to meet Paterno, to meet Sandusky, and then to go stay at special little houses.
[00:37:06.301 --> 00:37:06.601]  Where?
[00:37:08.043 --> 00:37:09.604]  Whatever people wanted ordered in.
[00:37:10.905 --> 00:37:11.545]  He's ordered in.
[00:37:11.585 --> 00:37:16.529]  You want a young nine-year-old girl with black hair and blue eyes?
[00:37:16.709 --> 00:37:17.590]  We can get her for you.
[00:37:18.524 --> 00:37:19.646]  You want a five-year-old boy?
[00:37:19.806 --> 00:37:20.747]  We can get it for you.
[00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.932]  And Sandusky's gonna deliver it to you.
[00:37:24.934 --> 00:37:29.981]  He's gonna have sex with the kids inside the Field House, in front of people, as an act of power.
[00:37:30.642 --> 00:37:34.128]  Until finally, it got so out of control, people said, we've got to stop it.
[00:37:36.032 --> 00:37:37.313]  Where did Dennis Hastert come from?
[00:37:37.373 --> 00:37:42.356]  He was the wrestling coach who reportedly would procure the children for the establishment.
[00:37:42.676 --> 00:37:48.799]  He was put into Congress, no political background, and then sent right to the Speakership because he was compromised.
[00:37:50.741 --> 00:37:51.721]  And it's bipartisan.
[00:37:53.702 --> 00:37:54.723]  And it's how they operate.
[00:37:56.223 --> 00:38:06.553]  You've got James Gunn and hundreds of tweets putting out pro-Nambla statements and using all the key statements that Nambla uses and the UN accepting Nambla to push all of this.
[00:38:06.573 --> 00:38:07.794]  I want to explain something.
[00:38:10.476 --> 00:38:19.245]  There are the fried, brain-damaged, traumatized, multiple personality people I call zombies.
[00:38:20.589 --> 00:38:22.291]  They're poor humans that have been put through hell.
[00:38:22.911 --> 00:38:24.353]  They don't want to have sex with children.
[00:38:24.373 --> 00:38:25.494]  They're just totally freaked out.
[00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:26.314]  They do whatever they're told.
[00:38:27.275 --> 00:38:31.379]  And they're just usually there at these places serving drinks and just kind of zombying around.
[00:38:31.399 --> 00:38:34.362]  They've usually been electroshocked, drugged.
[00:38:34.782 --> 00:38:36.284]  They've been raped since they were a year old.
[00:38:36.304 --> 00:38:37.465]  I mean, they're just totally gone.
[00:38:39.568 --> 00:38:44.211]  They're usually, you can usually tell them, even if they're like 30 years old, they're usually wearing a diaper because they've been raped so bad.
[00:38:45.092 --> 00:38:48.534]  They're just, I mean, I'm not, I've been told this by a hell of a law enforcement, and it's been confirmed.
[00:38:49.074 --> 00:38:54.517]  So the signs are like a woman or a man, you know, looks like 30, 40 years old, kind of out of the, wearing a diaper.
[00:38:54.818 --> 00:38:56.118]  These people are, they're gone.
[00:38:56.599 --> 00:39:04.424]  Then you'll have a Renfield above that, which is a Sandusky, who likes to have sex with kids because he was sexually abused.
[00:39:05.384 --> 00:39:07.706]  And he thinks it's love, and that's how he identifies.
[00:39:09.565 --> 00:39:12.048]  But he goes and then they always have that look.
[00:39:12.128 --> 00:39:12.849]  That's a Renfield.
[00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:21.040]  And they, I mean, take the guy that was doing all the snuff films with little kids that, you know, they call the King, King, King pedophile and talk about it.
[00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.663]  And he has that same look that they just finally busted.
[00:39:25.165 --> 00:39:27.227]  And he ran from Australia to the Philippines.
[00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:31.412]  Just type in King of the Pedophiles, but he's not really the King of the Pedophiles, he's a Renfield.
[00:39:31.952 --> 00:39:36.976]  But he would do some of the torturing and killing himself for the videotapes he was selling to Hollywood and New York.
[00:39:37.396 --> 00:39:38.317]  And he would get up to $50,000 per videotape.
[00:39:41.496 --> 00:39:42.437]  Why do they want video?
[00:39:42.477 --> 00:39:43.257]  It's like film.
[00:39:43.738 --> 00:39:46.040]  There's only a few of them.
[00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:54.647]  They shoot one, they make so many copies, and then it goes into the collection of these guys in Hollywood that think they deserve to have evil.
[00:39:54.807 --> 00:40:05.056]  The world's for them, and it's an exercise of their power to watch a three-year-old girl gang-rape by six, seven guys, blood everywhere, then they slit her throat or strangle her to death.
[00:40:06.428 --> 00:40:09.130]  And these are real law enforcement files that have come out, but you never see it in the news.
[00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:14.214]  Toddlers, little boy toddlers, 10-15 men rape them until they're half dead.
[00:40:14.494 --> 00:40:19.218]  I'm not going to describe how they're half dead, and then they revolve or shoot them in the head while they beg for money.
[00:40:20.399 --> 00:40:23.381]  Okay, yeah, show a frontal photo of that guy, and then show Sandusky.
[00:40:23.781 --> 00:40:24.522]  It's a look.
[00:40:26.303 --> 00:40:27.024]  It's a spirit.
[00:40:28.725 --> 00:40:33.349]  Now, there are the zombies, there are the Renfields, and there are the Draculas.
[00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:36.837]  And the Draculas have a history, they have a look.
[00:40:37.338 --> 00:40:41.863]  They will always attend spirit cooking events to let you know that they're Crowleyites, but that's only one inherent.
[00:40:42.003 --> 00:40:42.804]  It's an older order.
[00:40:43.425 --> 00:40:46.388]  And they always are into bankrupting countries, destroying society.
[00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:51.834]  Because that's their real feeding, is how many people, how many abortions can we have?
[00:40:52.155 --> 00:40:53.917]  How many vaccines can brain damage people?
[00:40:54.157 --> 00:40:55.559]  How much GMO can hurt people?
[00:40:57.148 --> 00:41:06.590]  The more they can hurt you, the more they can bankrupt your currency, the more they can bring your nation down, the more they can Nazi-collaborate, they move up in the hierarchy.
[00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:14.412]  The more wars they can fund, the more troops they can kill, the more families they can murder, that's all a blood sacrifice.
[00:41:15.113 --> 00:41:17.753]  When Hillary said, I came, I saw, he died, and Ted's going...
[00:41:22.686 --> 00:41:31.551]  He starts jack-o'-lanterning out, which is what they do when they're doing... Because, you know, it feels so good for her.
[00:41:31.591 --> 00:41:36.533]  I mean, that is... I mean, that... She's vamping out, folks.
[00:41:37.594 --> 00:41:43.697]  The chompers come out a whole nine yards, and it's... And let me tell you, she is a Dracula.
[00:41:45.298 --> 00:41:46.198]  Al Gore's a drac.
[00:41:46.978 --> 00:41:49.840]  And again, they don't live forever, folks, but the spirit is very old.
[00:41:52.112 --> 00:41:57.714]  And let me tell you, the face, it's well known, the face you see is, I'm not going to even make the full deal.
[00:41:58.314 --> 00:41:59.994]  It's, it's, it's, you know, the Joker.
[00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:01.555]  It's, ah, hello children!
[00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:18.980]  So just remember, all of you, from MSNBC to CNN to the New York Times, the Washington Post, you all know who you work for, you have all signed on to it, and I'm here
[00:42:20.717 --> 00:42:26.739]  So that it's on record that you've been warned and told what you're serving, so as it all comes out, you're going to be brought to judgment.
[00:42:26.759 --> 00:42:30.121]  But worse than that, God knows you know.
[00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:36.803]  And God now counts you as bad as the actual demon-possessed people that do this to the children.
[00:42:37.603 --> 00:42:44.406]  Because you weren't openly a Satanist, but you, out of cowardice and out of everything else, joined with this thing.
[00:42:44.446 --> 00:42:49.928]  And so you are all accomplices to the torture, rape,
[00:42:51.645 --> 00:42:58.871]  Murder of little children strung up and tortured inhumanely as the psychopaths say they, quote, suck their souls.
[00:43:00.413 --> 00:43:14.004]  I told you that we could retake America if you believed in capitalism, if you believed in freedom, if you believed in God, if you believed that you had some control over your destiny.
[00:43:14.805 --> 00:43:15.465]  And now we're here.
[00:43:16.596 --> 00:43:23.166]  As we're in the hottest part of the summer, going into the fall, the left is calling for civil war, total censorship of Infowars.
[00:43:23.406 --> 00:43:31.438]  They're lying about the president more than more, calling for violence against him, calling for him to be removed, calling for his family to be kidnapped, murdered, tortured.
[00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:32.719]  It's everywhere.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:38.802]  And then Trump says mainstream media is the enemy of the American people when they're fake news and lying.
[00:43:38.822 --> 00:43:42.424]  They go, Oh my God, you're going to cause us to get hurt.
[00:43:42.824 --> 00:43:47.306]  You've got Democrat candidates in Kentucky making jokes and saying, Hey,
[00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:50.187]  Rand Paul can be beaten for the Senate race.
[00:43:50.507 --> 00:43:51.487]  Look at what his neighbor did.
[00:43:52.047 --> 00:43:52.627]  It's everywhere.
[00:43:52.647 --> 00:43:54.508]  If I try to list it all, it'd take an hour.
[00:43:54.928 --> 00:43:57.049]  They're trying to bully us into submission.
[00:43:58.169 --> 00:44:07.992]  So now more than ever, with them all over the news saying de-platform us and lying about what we stand for and filing all these frivolous fake lawsuits that we're getting thrown out, this is the critical battle.
[00:44:08.232 --> 00:44:09.772]  Getting Trump in was just the beachhead.
[00:44:10.213 --> 00:44:12.513]  Now the real fight for liberty begins.
[00:44:12.893 --> 00:44:14.614]  We're entering the season of false flags.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.523]  Where the mainstream media knows it has no viewers, knows that it's basically now just corporate engines of censorship, just like the colleges.
[00:44:23.023 --> 00:44:31.887]  And so they're putting out the breadcrumbs out there, clearly having their own people, in my view, calling into C-SPAN and, you know, calling for CNN to get shot.
[00:44:33.347 --> 00:44:34.528]  I've been telling you that's coming.
[00:44:34.848 --> 00:44:42.511]  So we need to stop the violence, we need to say no violence, we need to decry violence, so that when and if they stage events, people see through it.
[00:44:43.527 --> 00:44:53.978]  I came out the day the drone attack happened in Venezuela, before any other media picked it up, and I said, I don't hear any explosions, I don't see any smoke, this looks totally staged in the video I see.
[00:44:54.238 --> 00:44:58.703]  And now even our own government and foreign governments are saying it appears to be a false flag.
[00:44:59.443 --> 00:45:00.905]  False flags do happen.
[00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:02.346]  Some things are real, obviously.
[00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:04.408]  But communists and scumbags
[00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:08.951]  Like a dictator of Venezuela who has staged elections, I believe has staged this.
[00:45:09.411 --> 00:45:16.415]  So don't think the Democrats, who are totally desperate, won't pull that card of victim when they're building it up, building it up, building it up.
[00:45:16.636 --> 00:45:32.525]  How many months have I been saying we're entering the false flag area where CNN or MSNBC or these other terrorist organizations against America that terrorize the truth, that lobby for the end of free speech, that lobby for their competitors to be taken off the air, that send out the reporters to stalk people and harass them.
[00:45:33.465 --> 00:45:38.910]  They're murderers and assassins of truth, and don't think their bosses aren't willing to go all the way.
[00:45:39.931 --> 00:45:43.895]  With that said, there is a way to defeat them and stand against their attempts to shut us down.
[00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:50.120]  Spread the articles, spread the videos, tell people in person about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.103]  Download the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:45:53.563 --> 00:45:54.044]  I think so.
[00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:27.512]  If you take the challenge at Infowarslife.com and get things that everybody needs like high quality krill oil, fish oil, honor roll for kids, the very best, highest quality, and learn about all the amazing things it does, that funds our operation.
[00:46:27.752 --> 00:46:34.317]  If you sign up for auto-ship, the additional 10% off that way each month, or every two months, whatever you sign up for, cancel any time.
[00:46:35.237 --> 00:46:37.378]  continues to fund us so you don't have to worry about it.
[00:46:37.678 --> 00:46:40.800]  You can get it done and know that you're tithing to the truth.
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.981]  You're tithing to your future.
[00:46:42.221 --> 00:46:50.145]  You're tithing against tyranny, for liberty, to an operation that you know has the enemy absolutely insanely mad.
[00:46:50.665 --> 00:46:52.906]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[00:46:53.206 --> 00:46:54.287]  Now it's up to you!
[00:47:03.712 --> 00:47:06.433]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:29.122]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:36.997 --> 00:47:48.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you just joined us, we're going into something that parental advisory is in effect.
[00:47:50.370 --> 00:48:11.861]  This is not for the squeamish of heart, but it's important to cover the hard subject because this is dealing with children, boys, little girls, young women, young men, the whole spectrum being brutally abused by organized crime syndicates that use abuse of children as rite of passage into their twisted cult.
[00:48:13.722 --> 00:48:18.605]  300 plus Catholic priests in an indictment produced by a grand jury.
[00:48:20.219 --> 00:48:47.095]  for systematic rape and torture of little boys and little girls in Pennsylvania and the state rep we have coming on is breaking it all down and spearheaded exposing it points out it's not just the Catholic Church it's everywhere it's all the big institutions have pedophiles taking control of them it's how they operate then they sell the sexualization of your children through sex ed through diversity training
[00:48:48.749 --> 00:48:50.711]  They then try to confuse your children's gender.
[00:48:50.731 --> 00:48:59.421]  You have adults identifying as children, as blind people, as you name it, just creating an atmosphere of total confusion.
[00:48:59.441 --> 00:49:07.871]  But we're going to go to the bottom of the rabbit hole and break down how we've been completely right and on target and why that's one of the main reasons.
[00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:12.616]  They want Infowars.com and Newswars.com shut down.
[00:49:13.477 --> 00:49:14.478]  So, get ready.
[00:49:14.578 --> 00:49:23.588]  This is not for the faint of heart, but this is the facts, and I'm going to break down the hierarchy, how it works, who they are, where their command bases are, and how we stop them.
[00:49:24.089 --> 00:49:25.090]  The children deserve it.
[00:49:26.192 --> 00:49:29.114]  The arrest of pedophiles are up tenfold according to the FBI.
[00:49:29.434 --> 00:49:32.777]  We don't just mean people with child porn, we mean with the kids, with the sex slaves.
[00:49:33.077 --> 00:49:46.586]  But it's so horrible, you'll see it in the news one day that this Cardinal got busted or that Cardinal or the Deputy Pope with a hundred kids trafficked and then it just leaves the news and they're busting them in Chile and they're busting them in Spain and they're busting them in all over the world.
[00:49:48.387 --> 00:49:51.910]  But again, it's not just the Catholic Church, it's any big institution.
[00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:55.212]  That's how these groups take over and how they use blackmail.
[00:49:56.624 --> 00:50:01.067]  And it's going on all over the place, and that's how they get fieldy.
[00:50:01.447 --> 00:50:09.693]  That's how they get control over a thousand children reportedly raped and abused by basically almost every priest in the state of Pennsylvania.
[00:50:11.734 --> 00:50:16.397]  This is a stronghold of evil, and we're going to go down the rabbit hole.
[00:50:17.358 --> 00:50:23.322]  Now, that said, I want to explain.
[00:50:23.342 --> 00:50:24.703]  This is not about sex with children.
[00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:28.931]  Just like they say in Team America, it's not about sex, Gary.
[00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:30.951]  It's about power.
[00:50:31.411 --> 00:50:32.491]  Now get on your knees.
[00:50:33.592 --> 00:50:36.452]  And that's one adult in the CIA to someone else.
[00:50:39.553 --> 00:50:41.693]  And I'm telling you, that's exactly how it works, folks.
[00:50:42.154 --> 00:50:45.154]  Full-grown men in Hollywood, they go, you want the part?
[00:50:45.934 --> 00:50:46.334]  Do this.
[00:50:47.435 --> 00:50:48.635]  And the next it's, do that.
[00:50:49.615 --> 00:50:52.936]  It's like Weinstein liked women that looked like they were about 15, weighed about 90 pounds,
[00:50:54.235 --> 00:50:59.199]  And he would make them watch him rub his fat rolls and rub all over himself.
[00:50:59.279 --> 00:51:00.619]  Hundreds of women have already come forward.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.483]  And then he'd say, you want the part, please, when we play the audio, get in here, squeeze my fat.
[00:51:06.744 --> 00:51:13.068]  And then you'd have to get in the fat rolls and do things that they haven't aired, but they've come out in court, that I'm not going to.
[00:51:13.088 --> 00:51:18.212]  The point is you have to worship the, the toe cheese under his fat rolls.
[00:51:20.002 --> 00:51:25.524]  And I'm hating to be gross here, ladies and gentlemen, but he's lost like 50 pounds now, he's pretty nervous.
[00:51:26.764 --> 00:51:34.046]  But imagine having to worship the goo that is under his arms and in between his feet and under fat rolls.
[00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:40.408]  Beautiful young women, the flower of beauty, productivity, fertility, the goddess.
[00:51:41.288 --> 00:51:42.228]  Archetype, God gave us.
[00:51:42.568 --> 00:51:45.349]  Humiliating the goddess instead of putting it on a pedestal.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:59.427]  All these cults are about defiling children, defiling women, then there's other cults that are about defiling strong warrior men, injecting them with vaccines, betraying them, screwing them over.
[00:52:00.088 --> 00:52:04.091]  They've got this whole thing, an energy-sucking, vampiric system set up.
[00:52:06.833 --> 00:52:07.934]  You're like, that sounds crazy.
[00:52:08.034 --> 00:52:11.737]  I know, but I've read their books, I've read their documents, I've done the research.
[00:52:13.078 --> 00:52:14.079]  This is what they're into.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.442]  It's called black magic.
[00:52:20.598 --> 00:52:24.060]  And in all the black magic movies, you know, Harry Potter, all that stuff thrown at your face, what do they want to do?
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.280]  They want to poison people.
[00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:26.701]  They want to steal their essence.
[00:52:26.721 --> 00:52:31.924]  They want to steal their... Pretty good film with Tom Cruise.
[00:52:32.524 --> 00:52:33.004]  A legend.
[00:52:33.524 --> 00:52:34.625]  They want to kill the unicorn.
[00:52:34.645 --> 00:52:35.686]  They want to kill the innocents.
[00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:44.030]  But the unicorn won't get close to the little demons so they can shoot it with a poison arrow and steal the horn to steal hope.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.702]  And steal creativity and life.
[00:52:48.242 --> 00:52:59.929]  They have to get the beautiful goddess, the beautiful young woman, who's so innocent, the little 15-year-old girl, going into womanhood to bring the spirit of innocence out.
[00:53:00.209 --> 00:53:01.450]  And that's what Hollywood does.
[00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.791]  Beautiful young women.
[00:53:03.131 --> 00:53:04.252]  Handsome, strong men.
[00:53:04.512 --> 00:53:05.192]  Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:53:05.592 --> 00:53:06.333]  Oh, the best people.
[00:53:06.373 --> 00:53:12.897]  And all it is, is like a trapdoor spider waiting behind the web with a little piece of food it leaves out for another bug to come by.
[00:53:14.721 --> 00:53:24.447]  And then when that little bug comes by... So this is all about a predator class feeding on humanity.
[00:53:26.649 --> 00:53:34.894]  This is all about a predator class that has set up a world that H.G.
[00:53:34.934 --> 00:53:35.634]  Wells wrote about.
[00:53:40.338 --> 00:53:42.459]  The Eloi and the Morlocks.
[00:53:44.687 --> 00:53:54.974]  The Eloi are beautiful and sweet and nice but innocent in the garden above and the Morlocks come up and grab them and literally eat them.
[00:53:57.056 --> 00:54:08.684]  Then by some twist of fate the innocent beautiful Eloi lived in fear where the prey of the ugly and grotesque but conscious of their evil Morlocks.
[00:54:10.705 --> 00:54:12.387]  Who you then learn were once Eloi.
[00:54:14.189 --> 00:54:19.612]  But went below and turned into the sharp-toothed predators they are.
[00:54:23.074 --> 00:54:25.535]  So all of us are Eloy and a Morlock.
[00:54:25.555 --> 00:54:28.377]  That's why the enemy doesn't like me.
[00:54:28.477 --> 00:54:32.159]  I'm a meaner Morlock than almost all of them, and they know that.
[00:54:32.699 --> 00:54:33.679]  But see, I'm an Eloy.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:34.840]  Stronger than that.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.062]  And that's why they want me off the air.
[00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:41.911]  They all aspire to be twisted and wicked.
[00:54:41.931 --> 00:54:44.031]  They all aspire to have the knowledge of good and evil.
[00:54:44.351 --> 00:54:47.372]  They all aspire to the knowledge.
[00:54:47.532 --> 00:54:53.273]  They don't have any of it because they genetically don't have access to it because they couldn't even handle it.
[00:54:54.034 --> 00:54:56.054]  They couldn't handle one tenth of it.
[00:54:57.775 --> 00:55:07.437]  And that's why they seek temporal technological computer power to use machines to track everybody to try to give them the sight that they don't have.
[00:55:10.404 --> 00:55:16.549]  These are truly the most fallen of the fallen people, and you don't want to be in their system.
[00:55:17.389 --> 00:55:17.710]  My view.
[00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:20.652]  Now, I haven't got into this.
[00:55:20.672 --> 00:55:26.156]  We got a state rep joining us, spearheading, exposing the giant pedophile rings that are now coming down.
[00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:29.439]  Praise God, praise Jesus Christ, praise all of you.
[00:55:29.579 --> 00:55:32.361]  I mean, thank all of you that have taken action and told the truth.
[00:55:32.681 --> 00:55:36.484]  The whole thing is circling its own destruction.
[00:55:38.322 --> 00:55:39.784]  The whole thing is coming down.
[00:55:39.824 --> 00:55:41.306]  They're blackmailing rings, all of it.
[00:55:41.587 --> 00:55:42.828]  They're having their bluff called.
[00:55:42.969 --> 00:55:44.451]  I'm calling their bluff, you're calling their bluff.
[00:55:45.112 --> 00:55:48.236]  It's not going to be easy, but it's going to be a lot better than going through with them in charge.
[00:55:49.226 --> 00:55:56.951]  This is all happening because they were about to go to the next level of oppression, and instinctively, spiritually, our ancestral programming kicked in.
[00:55:56.971 --> 00:56:00.814]  Those of us who've been in this trance, and we are now rising.
[00:56:01.494 --> 00:56:06.058]  Every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction to Newtonian physics, and you are that reaction, so that's coming up.
[00:56:06.518 --> 00:56:08.939]  CNN, by the way, and fullwords.com is calling us terrorists.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.881]  They don't say complicit in domestic terror.
[00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:11.621]  They want me arrested.
[00:56:12.862 --> 00:56:13.763]  So does MSNBC.
[00:56:13.863 --> 00:56:16.104]  They're just unbelievably criminal.
[00:56:18.683 --> 00:56:27.431]  I'm gonna call later for CNN to be deplatformed off Facebook, Google, Twitter, because according to their yardstick, I'm not really a censor, I'm not saying do that.
[00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:30.714]  I mean, they're the ones with famous fake news caught doing all this.
[00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:31.815]  They should be deplatformed.
[00:56:32.176 --> 00:56:34.778]  They lie about WMDs, they fake debate questions for Hillary.
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.601]  They've been caught doing it all.
[00:56:39.002 --> 00:56:40.744]  So, they should be taken off the air.
[00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:47.086]  You know, when Trump just talks about them being liars, they say he's trying to censor them, but they're running around as the real censors.
[00:56:47.126 --> 00:56:54.072]  This is a group of followers who've been hired from multinational corporations and the chi-coms that will do anything, and they will fight.
[00:56:54.412 --> 00:56:57.054]  You go to CNN, there's like one article about the pedophile ranks.
[00:56:58.055 --> 00:57:03.799]  It's their job to obscure all that, and a bunch of articles about how I'm bad and I'm calling for violence, and then no video, no proof.
[00:57:05.941 --> 00:57:07.202]  Alright, we're gonna go to break here.
[00:57:08.029 --> 00:57:08.649]  We're going to come back.
[00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:10.431]  Thank you all for your financial support.
[00:57:10.451 --> 00:57:11.752]  We got great products for you anyways.
[00:57:12.072 --> 00:57:18.457]  If you're not going to Infowarsstore.com and getting some of the great products, go there and click on support and send a donation.
[00:57:18.477 --> 00:57:19.037]  $5, $100, whatever.
[00:57:19.338 --> 00:57:23.301]  If you're middle class or wealthy, you're crazy if you don't double down and support us.
[00:57:23.521 --> 00:57:30.066]  Because, I mean, I am a war machine when it comes to taking on the globalists, and I am totally committed.
[00:57:30.931 --> 00:57:40.158]  And I'm just telling you, you cannot fuel a political weapon system that is more dedicated and more savage and more aggressive and more effective than InfoWars.
[00:57:40.498 --> 00:57:42.499]  We are number one enemy of the globalists.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.160]  We need your funds now.
[00:57:44.401 --> 00:57:45.602]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:46.102 --> 00:57:47.443]  A lot of great deals running right now.
[00:57:47.483 --> 00:57:48.283]  There's no excuse.
[00:57:48.343 --> 00:57:48.744]  Get in there.
[00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:53.715]  We need your support in this epic war against censorship.
[00:57:54.515 --> 00:58:09.328]  You have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost Alex Jones and InfoWars to fight the malicious, baseless harassment lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars across the country.
[00:58:10.128 --> 00:58:14.190]  These stories, these lawsuits have two purposes.
[00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:30.036]  One is to generate vicious negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter, and so on.
[00:58:30.996 --> 00:58:41.342]  It is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight this Soros-funded onslaught against InfoWars.
[00:58:42.243 --> 00:58:43.884]  We cannot do it alone.
[00:58:44.764 --> 00:58:52.169]  Therefore, I ask you to go to the InfoWars site now and find the location where you can make a contribution.
[00:58:52.649 --> 00:58:55.911]  Go to the donation portion of the site.
[00:58:56.511 --> 00:59:02.136]  And send us $50, or $100, or $250, or $500.
[00:59:03.397 --> 00:59:08.661]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 or more.
[00:59:09.501 --> 00:59:09.862]  Why?
[00:59:10.002 --> 00:59:15.666]  Because they know that this is the single most important challenge we face.
[00:59:16.707 --> 00:59:31.311]  Whether we win in 2018 and 2020, whether we can keep the new American Revolution going, whether the free ideas expressed here at InfoWars are allowed to continue are really up to you.
[00:59:31.771 --> 00:59:34.192]  The entire question is up to you.
[00:59:34.852 --> 00:59:36.032]  We need your support.
[00:59:36.652 --> 00:59:39.973]  We do not exaggerate the stakes or the dangers.
[00:59:40.393 --> 00:59:41.934]  We are not crying wolf.
[00:59:42.887 --> 00:59:48.152]  Please go to the InfoWars.com site now and support us with your dollars.
[01:00:05.209 --> 01:00:10.315]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:00:10.856 --> 01:00:13.278]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:23.830]  This magic moment, so different and so new, wasn't like any other.
[01:00:26.036 --> 01:00:35.605]  Until I kissed you And then it happened It took me by surprise
[01:00:54.309 --> 01:00:56.070]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're now into the second hour.
[01:00:56.110 --> 01:01:06.215]  In a few minutes, Representative Mark Rozzi, who's been spearheading, exposing the giant pedophile rings in Pennsylvania and other areas like tentacles spreading out across the country, is going to be joining us.
[01:01:06.335 --> 01:01:07.355]  And I'm not a Catholic.
[01:01:08.616 --> 01:01:14.778]  I know a lot of great Catholics and, you know, my wife's family are Catholic and they're wonderful, hardworking, great people.
[01:01:15.579 --> 01:01:16.339]  They're pro-life.
[01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:21.922]  But you've got the pedophile rings that try to take over every major institution.
[01:01:22.884 --> 01:01:37.972]  And so when I point out that it isn't just a Catholic problem, I do that because only the leftist media started exposing it after we exposed it over a decade ago because they thought they could take over the Catholic Church, which they've done with this new Pope, who even the Guardian admits used blackmail to get control.
[01:01:38.232 --> 01:01:46.176]  His deputy Pope got caught and is now in a trial for reportedly kidnapping and raping over 100 kids and sending them around to blackmail and control people.
[01:01:46.963 --> 01:01:52.567]  And so it's important to note that this is something they're using in governments and intelligence agencies.
[01:01:52.627 --> 01:01:53.467]  This is all over.
[01:01:53.828 --> 01:01:54.268]  Headline.
[01:01:55.409 --> 01:01:55.769]  Report.
[01:01:55.829 --> 01:01:58.791]  Pennsylvania priest molested over a thousand children.
[01:01:58.951 --> 01:01:59.371]  AP.
[01:02:00.232 --> 01:02:04.675]  Pennsylvania priest recommended for Disney World job after sexual abuse allegations.
[01:02:04.695 --> 01:02:05.876]  Grand jury report says.
[01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:06.556]  USA Today.
[01:02:07.036 --> 01:02:10.399]  Chile asked Vatican for information on sex abuse cases.
[01:02:11.428 --> 01:02:15.311]  Three ex-Penn State officials get jail terms in Sandusky abuse case for cover-up.
[01:02:15.771 --> 01:02:16.011]  U.S.
[01:02:16.051 --> 01:02:18.313]  Cardinal steps in on a man widening sex abuse scandal.
[01:02:18.853 --> 01:02:22.596]  301 Predator priests named in Pennsylvania grand jury sex abuse report.
[01:02:22.856 --> 01:02:24.417]  They were raping little boys and girls.
[01:02:25.257 --> 01:02:26.618]  CBS News, Pittsburgh.
[01:02:26.999 --> 01:02:28.400]  Oral sex in Holy Water.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.961]  Report documents abused by priests.
[01:02:31.423 --> 01:02:34.466]  State Rep Rozzi, child abuse is not just a Catholic problem.
[01:02:34.786 --> 01:02:40.571]  Survivors advocates rallied in state for statute of limitations reforms and that's the key.
[01:02:41.332 --> 01:02:49.159]  Go after all the bad Catholic priests that are really just globalist, leftist, weirdos that took control of it because they can control it and get away with it there because of the authority they have.
[01:02:49.699 --> 01:03:01.409]  It's in a bunch of other institutions like Hollywood and big Protestant churches have been caught and you've seen it in the news and universities and it's out of control because the normal people can't imagine this has been festering.
[01:03:01.609 --> 01:03:06.413]  We're going to break in just a few minutes but I want to say this is a nightmare but at least it's starting to come out.
[01:03:06.713 --> 01:03:09.335]  You've been at the tip of the spear of this along with the Attorney General of the state.
[01:03:09.756 --> 01:03:12.338]  This is just in the two minutes we have to break in a nutshell.
[01:03:12.738 --> 01:03:17.222]  I think what you're saying is you guys have only discovered the tip of the rotting iceberg.
[01:03:18.067 --> 01:03:18.687]  Absolutely.
[01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:24.549]  I mean, we know more information is going to be coming down the pipeline here, but you said it correctly.
[01:03:25.029 --> 01:03:28.311]  This child sex abuse is not just a Catholic clergy problem.
[01:03:29.111 --> 01:03:31.712]  It's across every institution out there.
[01:03:32.252 --> 01:03:34.953]  It's just that the Catholic hierarchy
[01:03:36.059 --> 01:03:40.862]  What they've done with this child sex abuse, and the abuse isn't even the scandal in this report.
[01:03:40.902 --> 01:03:46.344]  The scandal is that the hierarchy, you know, they protected these known perpetrators.
[01:03:46.704 --> 01:03:47.665]  They moved them around.
[01:03:47.925 --> 01:03:52.928]  They protected the institution's reputation and assets before ever protecting one child.
[01:03:53.348 --> 01:03:55.149]  And that's what this scandal is about here.
[01:03:55.169 --> 01:03:58.470]  The numbers, the sheer numbers, I mean, when you read over 1,000
[01:04:00.043 --> 01:04:03.748]  Child victims were identifiable from the church's own records.
[01:04:04.368 --> 01:04:07.712]  That must mean there's thousands of victims out there.
[01:04:08.313 --> 01:04:10.676]  And it's because they allowed it to go on.
[01:04:11.805 --> 01:04:19.270]  But, you know, we have legislation that are looking to hold them accountable, and we're going to be looking to push this hard coming up in the session in September.
[01:04:19.991 --> 01:04:26.035]  And again, the reason it gets covered up in institutions is, even if other people aren't involved, it's so damning, you tend to sweep it under the rug.
[01:04:26.275 --> 01:04:31.978]  So these pedophiles tend to go towards universities, big churches, other institutions, medical stuff.
[01:04:31.998 --> 01:04:35.421]  You're always seeing medical people doing it, because that's where they gravitate to get away.
[01:04:35.641 --> 01:04:37.322]  Schools, it happens in public schools.
[01:04:37.722 --> 01:04:37.942]  Yes.
[01:04:38.503 --> 01:04:39.104]  It's access.
[01:04:39.184 --> 01:04:40.365]  It's access to children.
[01:04:40.765 --> 01:04:52.438]  And then when you have, you know, superiors or hierarchy or leaders, whether it's in the school, whoever, you know, and when they decide to protect that reputation first, you know what's going to happen.
[01:04:52.718 --> 01:04:54.340]  More kids are going to be abused down the road.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:54.960]  That's right.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.762]  And then other vampires come into the mix.
[01:04:56.782 --> 01:04:59.965]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with Representative Mark Rozzi.
[01:05:00.746 --> 01:05:04.907]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:10.129]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[01:05:10.289 --> 01:05:11.470]  And here's the best part.

[01:05:22.594 --> 01:05:26.515]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:05:26.735 --> 01:05:30.857]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:35.137 --> 01:05:35.577]  Have you heard?
[01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:38.140]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:39.501]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[01:05:39.681 --> 01:05:40.742]  They're all censoring us.
[01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:46.989]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:50.332]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[01:06:09.608 --> 01:06:16.154]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.535 --> 01:06:21.699]  Mother, tell your children not to walk my way.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.245]  Tell your children not to hear my words, what they mean, what they say.
[01:06:27.665 --> 01:06:28.085]  Mother,
[01:06:31.767 --> 01:06:45.094]  There are literally thousands of news articles attacking me in the last two years because I said that child sex abuse in Penn State was the tip of the iceberg and that Hollywood was the real command base of this.
[01:06:45.914 --> 01:06:57.240]  Because I'd seen the Hollywood people, I'd been around it, I'd witnessed it, I'd talked to law enforcement, and I knew that Trump was planning to go after it to create a green light for everybody else to stand up and let the chips fall where they may.
[01:06:58.393 --> 01:07:15.761]  Representative Mark Rozzi doesn't want to be called a hero, but let me tell you, in Pennsylvania, where these powerful groups are running rampant with this, and now thousands of children reportedly abused, 301 priests in this grand jury report, I guess next indictments are coming, total vindication, and it's about
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:17.911]  The children.
[01:07:18.011 --> 01:07:19.533]  No one wants to believe this is going on.
[01:07:19.593 --> 01:07:25.599]  Those of us that aren't even imagining stuff like this, who just want to take care and love children, just can't even imagine it.
[01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:31.746]  If people just joined us, Representative Rossi, please recap what you said about it's the access.
[01:07:32.247 --> 01:07:36.331]  It's not that school resource officers or truancy officers are pedophiles.
[01:07:36.912 --> 01:07:42.116]  Because pedophiles might be one out of a thousand, but you get into school resource officers, statistically it's like one out of twenty.
[01:07:42.636 --> 01:07:50.482]  It's because the access, or CPS aren't all bad people, but some of the pedophiles try to get access there, or juvenile detention guards, they try to get access there.
[01:07:51.143 --> 01:07:53.304]  You were talking about this, or Catholic priests, or...
[01:07:54.205 --> 01:07:59.868]  Universities, or you always hear about these doctors or psychiatrists, you know, having to have sex with the kids.
[01:08:00.188 --> 01:08:04.851]  It's the power, it's the access, and it's this type goes for the power positions.
[01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:11.854]  It doesn't mean all the power positions are bad, but in any study of psychology, we know psychopaths and others seek out the power positions.
[01:08:11.874 --> 01:08:15.056]  So you've got the floor here to break down what's really happening in Pennsylvania.
[01:08:15.456 --> 01:08:18.938]  As you said, much bigger than the Catholic Church, and as you said, the abuse is terrible,
[01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:28.793]  But the big scandal, recapping, is that there's institutional cover-up that's like blood in the water and then just creates an atmosphere where this turns into like an orgy-like atmosphere.
[01:08:28.833 --> 01:08:30.255]  So please break down what's happened.
[01:08:30.888 --> 01:08:32.088]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:08:32.188 --> 01:08:40.431]  And again, as long as there is accessibility for these predators, you're going to find pedophiles abusing children everywhere.
[01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:47.813]  And in fact, the statistics in Pennsylvania are 1 in 4 girls, 1 in 6 boys will be sexually abused before the age of 18.
[01:08:48.293 --> 01:08:52.934]  And only 1 out of 10 will ever tell and get into the statute.
[01:08:53.574 --> 01:08:54.495]  Which is ridiculous.
[01:08:54.995 --> 01:09:01.599]  And most of these victims that are listed in this grand jury report, their statute of limitations, were only two years civilly and five years criminally defiled.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.100]  And predators know that.
[01:09:03.641 --> 01:09:10.585]  So, you know, they just wait the clock out, and then victims have no other access for justice.
[01:09:11.246 --> 01:09:14.228]  But in this report, you know, what I've really seen here is
[01:09:15.499 --> 01:09:36.413]  How the church had attracted these pedophiles, and there's one instance in the report where they talk about the pedophile ring in Pittsburgh, how these pedophile priests were sharing information, putting gold cross on young boys that they knew were susceptible to child sex abuse, and then they were passing them around.
[01:09:37.656 --> 01:09:47.221]  This is outrageous, and we wonder why the church was attracting these type of monsters, because they could come into a system that was easy, protectable.
[01:09:47.241 --> 01:09:53.864]  I mean, we had bishops and cardinals that we know have been dating girls or having same-sex relationships.
[01:09:53.884 --> 01:10:01.307]  So if your bishop is, you know, like Archbishop Cardinal Bevilaca, it was well known that he had a girlfriend.
[01:10:02.108 --> 01:10:06.793]  And Philadelphia Archdiocese was one of the worst as far as child sex abuse.
[01:10:07.273 --> 01:10:12.399]  And so if you have an Archbishop who has a girlfriend and you have a priest, no one's going to tell on each other.
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:21.923]  So, it's this power of the hierarchy that they held over the victims and silenced them, which allowed this problem to happen.
[01:10:21.983 --> 01:10:23.404]  But Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:10:23.444 --> 01:10:24.964]  This is everywhere.
[01:10:25.725 --> 01:10:35.969]  And again, I don't care if you're a Catholic clergy, I don't care if you're Jerry Sandusky, I don't care if you're a member of Hollywood, I don't care if you're my uncle, my brother, whoever.
[01:10:36.409 --> 01:10:39.350]  If you're sexually abusing children, we are coming for you.
[01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:41.612]  Let's talk about that statute for a moment.
[01:10:47.552 --> 01:10:54.475]  From your research, explain just briefly how you ended up being spearheading this, and a lot of people saying if it wasn't for you and the Attorney General, this wouldn't have happened.
[01:10:54.495 --> 01:10:59.057]  This is a big deal to get this report out, and then what do you think comes next?
[01:10:59.597 --> 01:11:00.198]  Well, you know what?
[01:11:00.518 --> 01:11:08.281]  I started this journey back on March 26th of 2009, when my second childhood friend took a gun, put it to his chest, and killed himself.
[01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:12.523]  And it was at that point, he was also sexually abused and raped by the priest that raped me.
[01:11:13.687 --> 01:11:21.092]  It was at that point I just knew I couldn't keep silent anymore, and I decided, okay, you know, what can I do?
[01:11:21.253 --> 01:11:27.777]  And I started attending some rallies up at the Capitol, and I saw no Democrats or Republicans standing for children.
[01:11:27.797 --> 01:11:31.600]  And I know how entrenchment works up there with these lobbyists.
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:36.362]  And I got pissed off, and let me be clear, I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican either.
[01:11:36.382 --> 01:11:40.243]  I often tell people, look at my voting record, you can't tell what I am.
[01:11:40.704 --> 01:11:43.365]  I'm all over the board, I'm going to vote for what I think is best.
[01:11:43.865 --> 01:11:52.529]  But I'm going to call, I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican, I'll call you out if I think that you're protecting predators and the institutions that are protecting these predators.
[01:11:52.949 --> 01:11:53.729]  That's the bottom line.
[01:11:53.829 --> 01:11:58.233]  I totally agree, and it seems like with Trump especially, record bust all over the country.
[01:11:58.254 --> 01:12:04.019]  Not just the child porn, but people actually making the films, abusing the children, young women.
[01:12:04.039 --> 01:12:08.624]  I mean, it seems like the worm is turning against these people thanks to your courage and others.
[01:12:09.064 --> 01:12:14.330]  Listen, I've been out in Hollywood, not even a lot, and had directors and people as an act of dominance grabbing me by the crotch.
[01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:18.172]  And when I told the story, they made fun of me in the news, but I mean, it really happened.
[01:12:18.212 --> 01:12:19.072]  It was humiliating.
[01:12:19.473 --> 01:12:21.834]  And I'm a pretty tough guy, and I was a full-grown guy when that happened.
[01:12:22.054 --> 01:12:27.677]  I couldn't imagine being a young child like you, so it's hard for me as a man to tell that story when it's nothing compared to what happened to you.
[01:12:28.258 --> 01:12:29.498]  So, I mean, it takes a lot of courage.
[01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:40.985]  Well, you know, I just knew that it was the right thing to do, and I often tell people, you know, when I was in that shower at age 13, getting raped by Father Evergraf, do you think I really knew what a statute of limitations was?
[01:12:42.099 --> 01:12:44.560]  You just knew it was embarrassing?
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.801]  In fact, don't most children get embarrassed and don't talk about it?
[01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:52.383]  Well, embarrassed and just that you blame yourself for guilt.
[01:12:52.743 --> 01:12:53.844]  It's humiliating.
[01:12:54.184 --> 01:13:05.829]  Plus, the day that, you know, I was in the room with the other altar boy and he did that to me and we ran out, he was threatening us to make sure that we kept silent or he was going to destroy our families.
[01:13:06.349 --> 01:13:12.740]  So then you have that aspect of, like, oh my God, if I talk about this, he's going to come and hurt my family now, too, as well.
[01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:18.289]  So... Why do you think there's so much of this in... Why does so much of this pop up in Pennsylvania?
[01:13:18.589 --> 01:13:20.111]  I know it's everywhere, but why Pennsylvania?
[01:13:20.871 --> 01:13:25.154]  Well, you know, I think we've had these institutions for a long time here.
[01:13:25.174 --> 01:13:31.078]  The Archdiocese of Philadelphia is one of the first dioceses across the United States that's been established.
[01:13:31.118 --> 01:13:37.142]  So, you know, this type of behavior within the Catholic Church has been going on for hundreds of years.
[01:13:37.922 --> 01:13:47.046]  You know, make no mistake about it, but let's be clear that it's not the victims that are making the church, you know, go bankrupt or close schools down.
[01:13:47.447 --> 01:13:49.027]  It's the church covering it up.
[01:13:49.547 --> 01:14:02.413]  What do you make of the, in Australia and Europe and the Vatican, the word that this particular Pope used, blackmail of this knowledge to get in control, and now his deputy, his aide-de-camp, has been put on trial?
[01:14:04.108 --> 01:14:04.789]  It's good stuff.
[01:14:04.849 --> 01:14:08.191]  It's finally, you know, we're seeing better things come out of the Vatican.
[01:14:08.231 --> 01:14:12.555]  And even though it's a lot of words, we'd like to see Pope Francis take a little bit more action on this.
[01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:16.118]  You know, that's where we'll see the real change.
[01:14:16.138 --> 01:14:20.161]  I mean, what he's done in Chile by accepting those resignations, good stuff.
[01:14:20.241 --> 01:14:21.182]  That's a good start.
[01:14:21.702 --> 01:14:25.885]  But make no mistake, this is still going on in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:26.346 --> 01:14:28.087]  But in a lot of dioceses.
[01:14:28.787 --> 01:14:32.951]  I expect the same thing to happen in New York shortly, that they will maybe
[01:14:33.991 --> 01:14:34.992]  Absolutely.
[01:14:35.192 --> 01:14:40.894]  I think this is just like you said earlier, tip of the iceberg.
[01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:45.996]  We're going to do a few more minutes after the break and you've got to go.
[01:14:46.016 --> 01:14:47.797]  I want you to come back for a full hour as soon as you can.
[01:14:47.897 --> 01:14:51.399]  pahouse.com.
[01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:58.622]  The minute we have before we go to break, you were trying to get into this statute so that obviously there shouldn't be a statute of limitations on raping children.
[01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:00.091]  No, absolutely not.
[01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:05.694]  Right now, the current statute of limitations in Pennsylvania have until age 30 civilly and age 50 criminally.
[01:15:05.994 --> 01:15:12.658]  But again, when most of these acts took place in this grand jury report, the children only had two years civilly and five years criminally to come forward.
[01:15:13.527 --> 01:15:21.510]  We absolutely need to eliminate the civil and criminal statute limitations moving forward that give our children any amount of time to come and report this.
[01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:28.713]  But again, the most important piece is going to be that two-year window of opportunity that the Catholic Church, of course, is fighting tooth and nail.
[01:15:30.334 --> 01:15:39.558]  But that's going to be the real courage test of the Catholic Church, whether or not they're going to step up and do the right thing or they're going to continue the ways that they have been doing in the past.
[01:15:39.938 --> 01:15:40.058]  Wow.
[01:15:41.021 --> 01:15:41.842]  I didn't even want to say it.
[01:15:41.862 --> 01:15:47.168]  I mean, I knew it reading the news, but I didn't want to say Representative Mark Rozzi raped by a Catholic priest here on air with us.
[01:15:47.228 --> 01:15:48.129]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:52.134]  Standing up, though, for all the children to think this was going on 20, 30 years ago.
[01:15:52.995 --> 01:15:55.277]  It's a lot worse now, and it's all over the place.
[01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.341]  Public schools are like having sex with a bunch of the kids.
[01:15:58.441 --> 01:15:59.202]  It is out of control.
[01:16:03.399 --> 01:16:09.023]  Together we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities.
[01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:15.827]  And we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel MS-13 and many other gangs.
[01:16:17.008 --> 01:16:20.030]  But MS-13 is particularly violent.
[01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:23.332]  They don't like shooting people because it's too quick.
[01:16:24.072 --> 01:16:24.933]  It's too fast.
[01:16:25.793 --> 01:16:31.377]  I was reading one of these animals was caught and explaining they like to knife them and cut them.
[01:16:32.389 --> 01:16:37.835]  And let him die slowly because that way it's more painful and they enjoy watching that much more.
[01:16:37.895 --> 01:16:38.636]  These are animals.
[01:16:38.917 --> 01:16:40.819]  Did you hear him call MS-13 animals?
[01:16:40.919 --> 01:16:41.580]  Yes, I did.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.481]  What did you think about that?
[01:16:42.761 --> 01:16:43.622]  I think he's a pig.
[01:16:43.642 --> 01:16:45.184]  An animal.
[01:16:45.244 --> 01:16:46.725]  I mean, you know, you smell your own, I guess.
[01:16:46.745 --> 01:16:48.768]  Maybe not all people in that group are animals.
[01:16:49.088 --> 01:16:50.229]  No, they're not animals at all.
[01:16:50.269 --> 01:16:51.629]  They're human beings just like all of us.
[01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:52.830]  I think he's a pig.
[01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:58.693]  He's just using that as an excuse to, I don't know, justify his being such a racist.
[01:16:58.793 --> 01:17:01.795]  And then this week Trump made the comment about MS-13 being animals.
[01:17:01.815 --> 01:17:02.415]  Did you hear about that?
[01:17:02.435 --> 01:17:03.156]  I did.
[01:17:03.176 --> 01:17:04.116]  What do you think about that?
[01:17:04.136 --> 01:17:08.079]  I think he's criticizing his own American people.
[01:17:08.179 --> 01:17:09.439]  What can you say about this guy?
[01:17:09.499 --> 01:17:10.140]  He's the animal.
[01:17:11.004 --> 01:17:13.267]  Would you agree that not all MS-13 members are animals?
[01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:14.067]  Absolutely.
[01:17:14.588 --> 01:17:14.768]  Cool.
[01:17:14.788 --> 01:17:16.170]  And then, um, it kind of, yeah, exactly.
[01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:18.893]  It's just like a negative, always negative in the news, always negative in the news.
[01:17:18.913 --> 01:17:22.016]  The guys that are running around gangbanging, killing people, they're animals.
[01:17:22.577 --> 01:17:22.817]  You know?
[01:17:23.298 --> 01:17:25.920]  But the rest of the gang, it's a big gang, you know?
[01:17:26.261 --> 01:17:29.845]  I can't decide whether I should laugh at this or it's like a punch to my gut.
[01:17:31.205 --> 01:17:32.606]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[01:17:32.826 --> 01:17:35.288]  And I feel like it's a punch to the gut a lot of times.
[01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:44.335]  And people with that last video, a lot of them say, oh, you probably interviewed a ton of people and picked the five people that actually supported MS-13.
[01:17:44.855 --> 01:17:48.738]  And Owen, I swear to you, those are the five people I interviewed.
[01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.299]  Those were the five reactions.
[01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.420]  I went five for five.
[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:54.543]  Every single person I asked, MS-13, are they animals?
[01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:57.305]  Every single person I asked in West Hollywood said no.
[01:17:58.005 --> 01:17:58.885]  So it's scary.
[01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:08.668]  We're in a really weird spot right now where the left, just to spite Trump, is doubling down on things that are in no way at all American or American values.
[01:18:08.708 --> 01:18:18.150]  And I think one of the only reasons the left is able to get away with these ridiculous stories, these ridiculous claims, is because their base audience has such a short attention span.
[01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:22.271]  So they basically engineered like the perfect resistor in a way.
[01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:26.412]  It's people with short attention spans, people that don't actually pay attention to politics.
[01:18:26.512 --> 01:18:34.173]  A lot of times they think they're educated because they went to college and are in debt, and for that reason they feel like they're oppressed and they know more than everybody.
[01:18:34.773 --> 01:18:38.354]  And a lot of what we're seeing now I think is going beyond politics.
[01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:44.635]  I think it's basically coming down to good versus evil, and I think it's coming down to establishment versus anti-establishment.
[01:18:45.055 --> 01:18:56.303]  And it's scary to see the left head in this direction because not too long ago, liberals were the ones who were for free speech, who were against censorship, who wanted to expose government corruption.
[01:18:56.684 --> 01:19:01.187]  And now we're seeing them side with things that I don't think anyone should ever side with.
[01:19:01.347 --> 01:19:05.110]  And it's just at a base level, you know, un-American, anti-American.
[01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:14.237]  But I think the good news is every time the left takes a stand and supports MS-13 or, you know, promotes the Me Too movement, meanwhile they're all
[01:19:14.697 --> 01:19:16.198]  Sexual predators in Hollywood.
[01:19:16.579 --> 01:19:21.523]  And every time they take a stand and contradict themselves, I think their audience shrinks just a little bit.
[01:19:21.703 --> 01:19:32.092]  And it's the people in the middle, the rational people, the centrists, the independents, the maybe even classical liberals, who are now looking around and saying, wait, why is my party defending MS-13?
[01:19:32.112 --> 01:19:36.095]  Why are we pretending that Hollywood isn't a toxic culture?
[01:19:36.455 --> 01:19:40.579]  And these are the people that are going to start heading to the right, just like we're seeing, you know, across the board.
[01:19:41.079 --> 01:19:56.694]  So while the far left will always be the far left and the protesters will always be pretty much brainwashed and convinced that Trump is the devil himself, everyone else in the middle who is somewhat rational will start waking up and their audience I think is shrinking by the day for that reason.
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.843]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:37.752]  Welcome back.
[01:20:37.773 --> 01:20:38.753]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:20:38.793 --> 01:20:39.955]  A few more minutes with...
[01:20:41.072 --> 01:20:55.292]  An American here, Representative Mark Rozzi, who was raped by a Catholic priest, state rep for now over a decade battling this, and now they've got grand juries with the reports ready to go after 301 priests, Catholic Church covering it up.
[01:20:55.832 --> 01:20:56.473]  Incredible news.
[01:20:57.699 --> 01:20:59.881]  Stefan Molyneux is going to be joining us here in just a few minutes.
[01:21:00.301 --> 01:21:04.565]  They're trying to ban his very popular YouTube channel with hundreds of millions, billions of views.
[01:21:05.446 --> 01:21:06.967]  All part of the giant purge that's ongoing.
[01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:10.270]  We'll talk to him about the ongoing war against him, full wars as well.
[01:21:10.711 --> 01:21:12.212]  Straight ahead, Representative Mark Razzi.
[01:21:12.252 --> 01:21:13.213]  Again, we just want to thank you.
[01:21:13.253 --> 01:21:14.134]  Very exciting what happened.
[01:21:14.574 --> 01:21:16.576]  Any other tidbits about what the Attorney General said today?
[01:21:17.016 --> 01:21:17.797]  What's coming next?
[01:21:17.857 --> 01:21:18.878]  Other points you'd like to make?
[01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:25.924]  Well, we know that there's still more victims calling the Attorney General's office, and this is by far not over by any means.
[01:21:25.964 --> 01:21:43.050]  But really, I think the message that we need to get out to everybody here is the people of Pennsylvania, our residents, they should be absolutely outraged about what's in this report and about what happened in the Boy Scouts, what's happening in our public schools, what's happening everywhere in this state.
[01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:50.953]  And they need to demand that their legislators, their senators, and their members of the House to actually do their jobs.
[01:21:51.053 --> 01:21:52.134]  I'm so sick.
[01:21:52.154 --> 01:21:56.056]  You know, I didn't get into politics to be a politician, alright?
[01:21:56.136 --> 01:21:57.677]  I'm not that type of person.
[01:21:58.057 --> 01:22:09.142]  I feel like, you know, to do what's right, I can be a legislator and I can just honestly look at the problem in front of me and think what's best for my district and leave the lobbyists and all that other crap out to the side here.
[01:22:09.942 --> 01:22:13.123]  But our legislators need to step up and do what's right.
[01:22:13.283 --> 01:22:14.504]  Lock the lobbyists out.
[01:22:15.384 --> 01:22:19.106]  And, you know, I know we have the votes in the House to pass it, and it's going to come down to the Senate.
[01:22:19.546 --> 01:22:22.567]  You know, it's going to come down to whether Senator Joe Scarnati
[01:22:23.411 --> 01:22:26.352]  It's going to stand with the predators, or is it going to stand with victims?
[01:22:27.112 --> 01:22:29.613]  And again, I don't care if you're a Dem or a Republican here.
[01:22:30.154 --> 01:22:41.338]  If you're not protecting children, and I'm absolutely not willing to compromise on this issue, you know, I'm not willing to put our children on the chopping block just to make the Catholic Conference happy.
[01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:48.993]  That's not me, and I'm going to hold these guys accountable from wherever you're coming from, that this never happens again in our commonwealth.
[01:22:49.033 --> 01:22:50.454]  Well, you've already come a long way.
[01:22:50.494 --> 01:22:53.715]  And again, growing up, I wasn't a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:22:53.755 --> 01:22:54.735]  Things have gotten so partisan.
[01:22:54.775 --> 01:22:55.836]  I'm a libertarian conservative.
[01:22:56.516 --> 01:22:57.136]  There you are.
[01:22:57.476 --> 01:22:59.837]  I consider myself a libertarian as well.
[01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:01.498]  I was about to say, but you're a Democrat.
[01:23:01.538 --> 01:23:06.541]  I could vote for a Democrat like you that has courage, that doesn't go off party, but goes off issue by issue.
[01:23:06.561 --> 01:23:07.241]  Right.
[01:23:07.701 --> 01:23:11.624]  And so, this is a big deal you guys have done for the children, and God bless you.
[01:23:11.644 --> 01:23:17.167]  I know there's probably been a lot of pressure on you behind the scenes, but we really want to thank you, Representative Mark Rossi from Pennsylvania.
[01:23:17.187 --> 01:23:17.487]  Thank you.
[01:23:17.887 --> 01:23:18.808]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:23:19.748 --> 01:23:27.773]  Folks, that is a big deal that they got that through and got that exposed with all these people that have been raped, and more and more of it's coming out, and this was a big, big deal.
[01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:37.720]  Joining us is Stefan Molyneux, who is one of the most popular free-thinking philosophers on the internet.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.501]  Very, very popular.
[01:23:38.521 --> 01:23:39.541]  Reaches billions of people.
[01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:42.162]  And he is locked out of his YouTube channel.
[01:23:42.182 --> 01:23:43.302]  That's what I keep telling everybody.
[01:23:43.942 --> 01:23:45.523]  They demonized me for a year and a half.
[01:23:45.543 --> 01:23:46.603]  They lied about what I say.
[01:23:46.623 --> 01:23:47.803]  To build a straw man.
[01:23:47.863 --> 01:23:49.244]  Hoped everybody else would run away from me.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.822]  Then they shadow banned me.
[01:23:51.882 --> 01:23:52.743]  Then they banned me.
[01:23:53.183 --> 01:23:58.449]  Now they've got me blocked on Twitter now on Alex Jones saying I want to attack the news with rifles.
[01:23:58.489 --> 01:23:59.950]  There's no video, no quotes.
[01:24:00.171 --> 01:24:00.731]  It's not true.
[01:24:01.472 --> 01:24:02.853]  And now they're going to get rid of Molyneux.
[01:24:02.994 --> 01:24:05.356]  And they're doing it to everyone that's prominent.
[01:24:05.476 --> 01:24:05.917]  I believe
[01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:08.455]  Ahead of something big.
[01:24:10.256 --> 01:24:11.756]  So we're going to get Molyneux's take on this.
[01:24:11.776 --> 01:24:12.837]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:14.497]  Freedomainradio.com.
[01:24:14.537 --> 01:24:16.858]  Important to mark that down because they're trying to take him off YouTube.
[01:24:17.338 --> 01:24:18.839]  Artoftheargument.com.
[01:24:19.159 --> 01:24:21.700]  Again, we're Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:27.861]  We're barely hanging on right now under DDoS attacks, internal attacks.
[01:24:29.022 --> 01:24:35.604]  We just had, I'll get into it after Molyneux leaves us, but we've been paying millions of dollars over the last five years to
[01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:39.087]  One of the biggest video streaming companies out there.
[01:24:39.127 --> 01:24:39.667]  We pay them.
[01:24:40.468 --> 01:24:41.669]  And their employees want us off.
[01:24:41.829 --> 01:24:42.569]  We've gotten notice.
[01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:45.292]  So, I mean, people are like, oh, it's a private company.
[01:24:45.312 --> 01:24:45.512]  Yeah.
[01:24:46.232 --> 01:24:48.194]  I'm literally being denied service everywhere.
[01:24:48.494 --> 01:24:49.415]  This is terrorism.
[01:24:49.495 --> 01:24:51.236]  And CNN is calling me terrorist now.
[01:24:51.296 --> 01:24:52.357]  So, we'll talk about it all.
[01:24:52.718 --> 01:24:54.419]  Stefan Molyneux, it's been a while.
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:57.822]  It's good to have you back with us.
[01:24:57.882 --> 01:24:58.983]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:24:59.878 --> 01:25:00.498]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:00.619 --> 01:25:08.304]  I wish the circumstances were better, but here we are chatting about the most essential issue of the civilization we live in, which is free speech.
[01:25:09.164 --> 01:25:09.564]  That's right.
[01:25:09.584 --> 01:25:11.886]  Well, I'll always interrupt, so let me get into it.
[01:25:11.926 --> 01:25:13.107]  What would you call this moment?
[01:25:13.207 --> 01:25:14.328]  Why do you think they're doing it?
[01:25:14.428 --> 01:25:18.130]  Why are they, CNN, openly lobbying for me to be taking it off?
[01:25:19.011 --> 01:25:19.791]  Senators, U.S.
[01:25:19.831 --> 01:25:22.553]  Senators saying take all conservatives, everyone off.
[01:25:22.633 --> 01:25:25.075]  I mean, it's like they're embracing Mao Zedong.
[01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.749]  Well, it's the Tonya Harding moment for the mainstream media.
[01:25:29.211 --> 01:25:32.623]  Which is, of course, if you remember Tonya Harding attacked a competitor.
[01:25:33.697 --> 01:25:38.461]  In a skating competition, I think it was, because she couldn't compete, or at least felt that she couldn't compete.
[01:25:38.822 --> 01:25:41.123]  Deplatforming people is not an argument.
[01:25:41.504 --> 01:25:55.515]  And the fact that we're doing so well, I think that the Democrats, the leftists, generally looked at the 2016 election and said, wow, turns out social media has quite a bit of impact, and it turns out that those who are really good at social media can really swing the political needle.
[01:25:55.555 --> 01:25:59.758]  We must never let that happen again, they said, and I think this is the implementation of that plan.
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.741]  They admitted it, so what do we do?
[01:26:04.870 --> 01:26:07.294]  Well, I think we just have to keep making better and better arguments.
[01:26:07.334 --> 01:26:13.405]  You know, one thing I noticed when I was in Australia and New Zealand was I had a couple of interviews with the mainstream media.
[01:26:13.505 --> 01:26:17.352]  I broke policy of not talking to the mainstream media because I felt it was worth it.
[01:26:18.047 --> 01:26:24.588]  And their hit pieces on me did tens of thousands of views, but the full interviews which we recorded have done hundreds of thousands of views.
[01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:27.849]  So they've lost the power to try and destroy people's lives.
[01:26:27.949 --> 01:26:35.051]  Every time they attack people now with the full videos and your right of reply on YouTube, we're destroying their credibility every time they open their mouth.
[01:26:35.071 --> 01:26:36.751]  So now they're about to ban you on YouTube.
[01:26:36.911 --> 01:26:40.232]  They want to take your voice away so they can build the straw man.
[01:26:41.576 --> 01:26:48.320]  Well, sure, if you can't compete, then you try and take out your competitor if you are an amoral, if not downright immoral, power seeker.
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.461]  And I invite the mainstream media to up their game.
[01:26:51.501 --> 01:27:00.086]  You know, this is an opportunity for them to become better at what they do, to become more honest, to have more integrity, to engage people in a more honest and open way.
[01:27:00.166 --> 01:27:04.228]  I don't know if they're going to take this opportunity, but I invite them.
[01:27:04.929 --> 01:27:08.840]  To try and compete with us in an open platform rather than try and de-platform us.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.890]  I'm not sure they're going to, but it would be a wonderful opportunity for them to become better people.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.641]  Well, CNN now full-time lobbies to have us taken off, and I know you off.
[01:27:17.701 --> 01:27:23.903]  We got Project Veritas' video last year where they're talking to the head New York Times liaison to Google and YouTube, and they said, well, what's your job?
[01:27:24.303 --> 01:27:30.845]  Oh, I keep Alex Jones and Paul Watson off the internet, and anybody else that's like a libertarian or a redneck.
[01:27:30.865 --> 01:27:31.645]  And they go, what's a redneck?
[01:27:31.685 --> 01:27:32.925]  Well, American flags.
[01:27:33.405 --> 01:27:34.946]  And they go, yeah, these dumb bastards.
[01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:38.113]  They think they're talking to people, but they're not.
[01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:39.415]  We've shadow banned them.
[01:27:39.815 --> 01:27:47.525]  And you're just looking at this person, who's the head of the New York Times operations, and you realize, oh, the New York Times, for Carlos Slim, isn't even a fake news outlet.
[01:27:47.886 --> 01:27:51.731]  It is an organized, bullying, censorship, thought police brigade.
[01:27:53.416 --> 01:27:58.500]  Yeah, do you remember when we were told that diversity of thought, diversity of opinion was a great strength of Western countries?
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:00.442]  So we invited all these people in.
[01:28:00.682 --> 01:28:05.566]  Well, not really invited, but lots of people came in from cultures that have no history of respecting free speech.
[01:28:05.906 --> 01:28:10.029]  Funny story, it turns out diversity was a complete false flag.
[01:28:10.049 --> 01:28:18.336]  It turns out that when you invite a lot of people into your countries with no history of respect for free speech, your free speech gets fractured and crumbles at the very base.
[01:28:18.636 --> 01:28:20.898]  And that is a very important thing, to criticize diversity
[01:28:21.758 --> 01:28:30.958]  Is apparently no longer part of the acceptable panoply of Western opinions and therefore must be banned and we all know why because the people who come into Western countries particularly from the third world
[01:28:31.698 --> 01:28:41.141]  Relentlessly vote for the left, relentlessly vote Democrat, and they're willing to sacrifice all the freedoms our ancestors fought for just to get the drip-drip dopamine of political support.
[01:28:42.021 --> 01:28:42.481]  Exactly.
[01:28:42.541 --> 01:28:52.403]  It's actually destroying their own future, whether they be people from, you know, Eastern Europe that didn't have freedom or from Latin America, whatever, but they just feel like there's the power of ganging up.
[01:28:52.463 --> 01:28:56.905]  It's so much fun to be whipped into a drooling mob, something our founders warned us of.
[01:28:56.945 --> 01:28:57.985]  We'll be back with Stefan Mullinen.
[01:28:59.818 --> 01:29:03.500]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses Silversol technology.
[01:29:03.781 --> 01:29:07.223]  There's been extensive research on Silversol technology.
[01:29:07.563 --> 01:29:16.969]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity
[01:29:17.609 --> 01:29:21.031]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[01:29:21.392 --> 01:29:26.355]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[01:29:26.415 --> 01:29:28.776]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[01:29:29.037 --> 01:29:33.619]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[01:29:33.679 --> 01:29:34.300]  Ah, you don't want that.
[01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:38.501]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:41.381]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[01:29:41.661 --> 01:29:44.962]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[01:29:45.342 --> 01:29:50.643]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[01:29:50.703 --> 01:29:54.844]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:58.385]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:04.732]  I've got a big announcement here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:04.772 --> 01:30:06.152]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[01:30:06.832 --> 01:30:17.336]  You saw Dan Rather come out and, you know, demonize me and attack what we're doing here at InfoWars and call us fake news.
[01:30:17.376 --> 01:30:18.676]  But, you know, he's the fake news.
[01:30:18.816 --> 01:30:24.698]  And he also recently came out and said that Trump is mean like a wolverine.
[01:30:24.798 --> 01:30:26.439]  So earlier this week, I said, hey,
[01:30:27.139 --> 01:30:29.942]  Let's put out Trump as a Wolverine.
[01:30:30.423 --> 01:30:33.327]  MeanLikeAWolverineInfoWars.com.
[01:30:33.387 --> 01:30:35.049]  Beautiful new red shirt.
[01:30:35.169 --> 01:30:37.331]  Incredible job with the graphics crew.
[01:30:37.411 --> 01:30:38.833]  They are amazing.
[01:30:39.514 --> 01:30:38.833]  1995.
[01:30:39.694 --> 01:30:40.635]  High quality shirt.
[01:30:40.776 --> 01:30:42.638]  It's being printed right now.
[01:30:42.758 --> 01:30:44.240]  They'll be shipping out next week.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.860]  Get your order in.
[01:30:45.941 --> 01:30:47.101]  This is a limited edition.
[01:30:47.181 --> 01:30:49.442]  This needs to be the new viral shirt.
[01:30:49.502 --> 01:30:51.062]  Now, I think I got another idea today.
[01:30:51.162 --> 01:30:54.263]  We've got printing right here in Texas now, so we can get this by next week as well.
[01:30:54.744 --> 01:31:00.105]  I just put in a giant order because I saw Walmart boycott launched over Impeach 45 clothing.
[01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:01.726]  Don't boycott Walmart over that.
[01:31:01.906 --> 01:31:02.826]  Just say Walmart.
[01:31:03.547 --> 01:31:04.827]  I don't care if they copy our shirt.
[01:31:04.947 --> 01:31:06.047]  Put out a reelect 45.
[01:31:07.748 --> 01:31:09.368]  You know, let's engage in that.
[01:31:09.448 --> 01:31:10.549]  So, they've got their Impeach45.
[01:31:10.769 --> 01:31:12.909]  You go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:12.929 --> 01:31:18.651]  We have Reelect45 with an American flag, very triggering, on the right arm and on the back.
[01:31:19.071 --> 01:31:20.211]  Infowars.com.
[01:31:20.951 --> 01:31:23.572]  I am the resistance.
[01:31:24.892 --> 01:31:26.873]  I am the resistance.
[01:31:28.193 --> 01:31:30.014]  This, I mean, these shirts have just been hitting me.
[01:31:30.074 --> 01:31:31.454]  And I knew Hillary for President.
[01:31:32.254 --> 01:31:35.275]  I saw a handmade sign in a yard.
[01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:39.625]  About, you know, like three years before the election.
[01:31:39.685 --> 01:31:40.925]  They knew she'd run.
[01:31:40.986 --> 01:31:44.087]  And then I remember thinking, or two years before, I thought, we've got to do that.
[01:31:44.187 --> 01:31:47.690]  And we went to the RNC, and a third of the people were wearing it.
[01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:48.530]  It was the chance.
[01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.552]  We had planes flying around saying it.
[01:31:51.912 --> 01:31:53.013]  Behind them, it was incredible.
[01:31:53.033 --> 01:31:53.793]  It was a magic moment.
[01:31:54.334 --> 01:31:56.115]  And I know when something's going to be a hit.
[01:31:56.795 --> 01:32:02.799]  So they've got their Impeach 45, Re-elect 45, baseball shirt style, white, blue, and red.
[01:32:03.119 --> 01:32:03.679]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:32:03.919 --> 01:32:05.961]  And then black on white, I am the resistance.
[01:32:06.961 --> 01:32:08.721]  It's an awesome shirt.
[01:32:09.002 --> 01:32:08.721]  $19.95.
[01:32:09.062 --> 01:32:10.822]  High quality fabric.
[01:32:10.862 --> 01:32:11.682]  Made right here in America.
[01:32:11.722 --> 01:32:12.442]  Printed in America.
[01:32:12.462 --> 01:32:15.423]  So, you know, it's costing us six, seven bucks to do that in America.
[01:32:15.443 --> 01:32:16.703]  We do it for three bucks in Mexico.
[01:32:17.103 --> 01:32:17.704]  So it's there.
[01:32:18.124 --> 01:32:19.124]  Help fund the operation.
[01:32:19.204 --> 01:32:20.324]  Reelect45.
[01:32:20.664 --> 01:32:21.784]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:22.145 --> 01:32:22.965]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:23.085 --> 01:32:23.185]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:23.245 --> 01:32:24.205]  And mean like a wolverine.
[01:32:28.986 --> 01:32:32.167]  These shirts are both so good, I don't know which one's gonna be a best-seller.
[01:32:32.187 --> 01:32:34.788]  And right through the 4th of July, free shipping across the store.
[01:32:34.808 --> 01:32:38.050]  50% off Rainforest, which we just went out and said, what are the top new trophies?
[01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:39.210]  Okay, here they are.
[01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:39.931]  But why is it 60 bucks?
[01:32:39.951 --> 01:32:41.271]  There's like $10 a product in this.
[01:32:41.931 --> 01:32:43.612]  I'll just make it even stronger, sell it for $30.
[01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:45.273]  When it's discounted, it's like $19.95.
[01:32:45.373 --> 01:32:47.954]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:32:48.334 --> 01:32:50.155]  Infoworkstore.com, with free shipping.
[01:32:50.415 --> 01:32:51.195]  You can't beat that.
[01:32:51.515 --> 01:32:56.037]  Throughout this entire July 4th, 2nd American Revolution, Super Sale!
[01:33:04.187 --> 01:33:06.930]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.499 --> 01:33:19.622]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[01:33:20.563 --> 01:33:24.066]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:24.827 --> 01:33:26.629]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.327 --> 01:33:33.089]  So, Stefan Molyneux is an author, philosopher, researcher, former businessman, very successful, smart guy, everybody loves him.
[01:33:33.109 --> 01:33:35.970]  And he's effective with the left, the right, everybody.
[01:33:36.170 --> 01:33:41.651]  So, they want to lie about him, but every time he does an interview, he tapes it, like we do sometimes.
[01:33:42.151 --> 01:33:48.353]  And then, like Megyn Kelly, we had like 6 million views on our video debunking her, and her show had 6 million views.
[01:33:49.113 --> 01:33:50.574]  Well, that's why they just deleted our YouTube channel.
[01:33:51.394 --> 01:33:53.535]  They're not going to let me actually say what I have to say.
[01:33:54.235 --> 01:33:56.975]  They're going to create the straw man.
[01:33:57.776 --> 01:34:04.137]  And a great example of this is our app we launched a month ago was in the top 40 in news when it came out, which is still great.
[01:34:04.938 --> 01:34:06.098]  And CNN was like number eight.
[01:34:06.118 --> 01:34:07.718]  The New York Times was like number seven or whatever.
[01:34:07.838 --> 01:34:12.660]  It went to number one on Google, Android, and on the other app.
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:14.120]  Not just in trending, that's from last week.
[01:34:15.555 --> 01:34:21.618]  It's a number one period in news, and it's trending towards number one period, thanks to the Streisand effect.
[01:34:22.098 --> 01:34:30.082]  Their answer is full-on lobbying campaign to take it down, and now CNN is calling me a domestic terrorist, close quote.
[01:34:30.862 --> 01:34:33.423]  So they are now going into total desperation mode.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.604]  Think they understand that people now have a hunger for alternative views.
[01:34:38.064 --> 01:34:40.788]  They could, God forbid, kill Stefan Molyneux and myself tomorrow.
[01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:43.131]  It's not going to stop.
[01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:44.874]  I mean, I really think the chain reaction has begun.
[01:34:44.894 --> 01:34:46.636]  Let's see if Stefan Molyneux thinks I'm right.
[01:34:47.137 --> 01:34:50.081]  Then I want to ask him, I think Trump's biggest failure
[01:34:51.382 --> 01:34:54.944]  Is that he hasn't been strong enough on the censorship.
[01:34:54.984 --> 01:34:56.125]  He hasn't gone after it.
[01:34:57.045 --> 01:35:09.072]  He lets Tim Cook of Apple and the people at Google sit there and gaslight him because they have taken anybody that supported anything Trump's doing or just supported prosperity and they have shadow banned us down 90%.
[01:35:09.212 --> 01:35:14.255]  I've been totally banned and so I think that's his big failing and I think we should
[01:35:15.555 --> 01:35:17.337]  Set the trap wires up to Trump.
[01:35:17.457 --> 01:35:23.682]  Everybody should be calling the White House, calling talk radio, calling him, and, you know, really getting on his butt.
[01:35:23.702 --> 01:35:24.502]  Stefan, what do you think?
[01:35:25.643 --> 01:35:30.427]  You know, I had a great question, Alex, when I was, after I gave a speech in Australia.
[01:35:31.168 --> 01:35:35.311]  Audience member came up and said to Lauren and myself, said, where do you get your courage from?
[01:35:36.092 --> 01:35:37.293]  And I said, it's very simple.
[01:35:37.973 --> 01:35:43.137]  I get my courage from you, the listeners, from you, the audience, from those who support what it is that I'm doing.
[01:35:43.177 --> 01:35:45.079]  And I'm sure you feel the same way with your audience.
[01:35:45.715 --> 01:35:46.717]  It's the same thing with Trump.
[01:35:47.077 --> 01:35:48.660]  Where does Trump get his success from?
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:56.071]  He gets success not from his own charisma alone, not from his own considerable speaking skills, not from his political skills, his negotiation skills.
[01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:58.094]  These are all necessary but not sufficient.
[01:35:58.414 --> 01:36:01.159]  The wind in his sails was the supporters.
[01:36:01.829 --> 01:36:02.769]  Worse than social media.
[01:36:03.069 --> 01:36:07.951]  And if you don't support those who support you, the relationship tends to crumble.
[01:36:08.291 --> 01:36:11.692]  And I think it is essential for Trump to recognize this.
[01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:20.494]  For those who succeed in the anti-leftist sphere, they succeed partly as a result of efforts from people like you and myself and countless others and the supporters thereof.
[01:36:21.034 --> 01:36:23.016]  It's time to get out and support your team.
[01:36:23.156 --> 01:36:36.326]  And I think that's really... I don't know what that looks like politically, but I will say that if it does look like these social media giants are censoring based on political content, I think that they're going to lose their immunity from lawsuits because they're no longer going to be a neutral platform.
[01:36:36.346 --> 01:36:38.968]  They're going to be more like a newspaper and less like a blog hoster.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:48.504]  Well that's it, and they now admit gleefully in the New York Times, Washington Post, they say fake things I didn't say and then go, it's time for him not to have a voice in the public square.
[01:36:48.824 --> 01:36:50.945]  The public square is now Facebook and YouTube.
[01:36:51.285 --> 01:36:52.466]  We've got to silence him.
[01:36:52.826 --> 01:36:58.108]  They're admitting the malice of forethought, intent to do harm, where, Stefan, I've never seen stuff like this before.
[01:36:58.149 --> 01:37:00.029]  I say, I want to non-violently defeat this.
[01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:01.970]  CNN says people want to attack him.
[01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:04.151]  Antifascists come in and attack people in their houses.
[01:37:04.191 --> 01:37:07.213]  We need to politically take them out now, legally and lawfully.
[01:37:07.853 --> 01:37:10.815]  That turns into Jones wants to use a battle rifle on CNN.
[01:37:11.275 --> 01:37:15.097]  And then Twitter says, you're suspended for this, and the video doesn't say that.
[01:37:15.137 --> 01:37:19.000]  It's like, if the New York Times said the moon was made of cheese, they would believe it.
[01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:26.204]  Well, our free speech, Alex, as you know, is recast as violence, and their violence is recast as free speech.
[01:37:26.244 --> 01:37:32.508]  Like, it's just some kind of protest to hit someone with a bike lock or smash a camera or attack people with cement blocks and so on.
[01:37:32.908 --> 01:37:35.690]  The violence that they're addicted to, the violence that they love,
[01:37:36.170 --> 01:37:36.410]  Yeah.
[01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.470]  Oh!
[01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:03.832]  They're all protected.
[01:38:03.852 --> 01:38:05.274]  I'm sorry, you're right.
[01:38:05.514 --> 01:38:06.676]  Reasonable people are shut down.
[01:38:07.036 --> 01:38:15.407]  And if you continue to promote violent groups and suppress those who are making peaceful arguments, we all know historically exactly where this leads.
[01:38:16.155 --> 01:38:16.836]  Which is what I think.
[01:38:16.856 --> 01:38:18.277]  They know they've lost the political arguments.
[01:38:18.437 --> 01:38:18.898]  So you're right.
[01:38:18.918 --> 01:38:26.746]  You've got Cuomo, you've got CNN, MSNBC, all defending them being violent, saying it's good, then covering up when they attack their own camera people.
[01:38:26.787 --> 01:38:29.009]  They're so savage and whipped up out of control.
[01:38:29.349 --> 01:38:34.795]  And it's like Antifa is this little, sweet, protected group, and it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:38:34.815 --> 01:38:35.776]  So let me ask you that question.
[01:38:36.137 --> 01:38:37.859]  Where do you think it's going next?
[01:38:38.419 --> 01:38:52.220]  That as you said, CNN is literally, and the New York Times going around policing the internet, bragging in undercover videos, they're banning people now in public doing it, literally like the Grinch that stole Christmas villainously, smashing free speech over the head with a brick.
[01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.063]  I mean, they couldn't be bigger villains!
[01:38:55.603 --> 01:38:58.907]  There is a culture war, I believe, going on, and it's probably hidden from us.
[01:38:59.447 --> 01:39:00.388]  At least it seems to be.
[01:39:00.408 --> 01:39:03.051]  Alex, there's a culture war going on within the tech giants.
[01:39:03.391 --> 01:39:13.062]  And the culture war is those remnants of the original crew who got together because they wanted to facilitate communication, they wanted to facilitate free speech, they wanted to facilitate unbiased
[01:39:13.642 --> 01:39:15.923]  Searching for essential human information.
[01:39:15.963 --> 01:39:23.105]  There are those in there and then there are other people who've come swarming in who wish to use the power of the tech giants in pursuit of political aims and political goals.
[01:39:23.725 --> 01:39:29.246]  I want to support the people, the good people in the tech giants who want to push back against this encroaching tyranny.
[01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:35.668]  I want to help support them so that they can fight against all of the politically correct tyranny that is growing within these companies.
[01:39:35.728 --> 01:39:39.049]  Because if we lose the fight on social media, the fight goes to the streets.
[01:39:39.169 --> 01:39:40.049]  I guarantee you that.
[01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:41.830]  And I don't want that to happen and neither do you.
[01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:46.016]  Well, I love talking to you because we're not sitting there checking each other's nose, but we're on the same page.
[01:39:46.416 --> 01:39:53.404]  I've confirmed from high-level sources that have had dinner with Dorsey and others that he is a big liberal, but more of a classical.
[01:39:53.424 --> 01:39:55.006]  He's like, listen, I'm being pressured to censor.
[01:39:55.046 --> 01:39:55.866]  I have mutinies.
[01:39:56.627 --> 01:39:59.190]  We're seeing mutinies inside companies shutting us down.
[01:39:59.230 --> 01:40:00.471]  We're just buying services.
[01:40:01.192 --> 01:40:03.414]  You see people being refused food, being attacked.
[01:40:03.794 --> 01:40:06.876]  Candace Owens being called a Nazi by a bunch of crazy white people.
[01:40:07.397 --> 01:40:17.084]  And you're right, there is a civil war inside tech of true mutiny going on with people turning off our YouTube channel four months ago and they had to reinstate it.
[01:40:17.104 --> 01:40:20.946]  It was just a mutineer turning Trump's Twitter off and we learned it's a mutiny.
[01:40:20.966 --> 01:40:26.370]  So I'm really worried about in this crazed... Well, hey, did you just figure that out from the outside or have you gotten inside intel?
[01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:29.913]  Because I've confirmed there is a serious civil war, a culture war,
[01:40:30.493 --> 01:40:31.974]  Going on inside Big Tech right now.
[01:40:33.274 --> 01:40:55.082]  I'm just feeling the underground battles based upon the vibrations reaching the surface, but I do want to say to the good people at Google, at YouTube, at Facebook, and there are good people in there who respect the mission of allowing free speech, of allowing the facilitation of exchanges of human communication, and I just implore you, you know, you have to take a stand, because if you don't take a stand, if you allow
[01:40:55.774 --> 01:41:00.964]  The left and the control freaks to take over your platforms, your companies will be economically destroyed.
[01:41:01.684 --> 01:41:03.145]  They will be economically destroyed.
[01:41:03.185 --> 01:41:04.006]  People will flee.
[01:41:04.046 --> 01:41:11.472]  The messages that I've gotten saying, I'm going to cancel, I'm going to boycott, I'm going to boycott the advertisers because I hate what is happening to free speech on these platforms.
[01:41:11.872 --> 01:41:17.157]  You have to take a stand for free speech in your companies or I genuinely believe those companies will decay.
[01:41:17.377 --> 01:41:21.821]  It was not long ago that MySpace was on the very top, that AOL was on the very top.
[01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:23.362]  It can change like that.
[01:41:23.502 --> 01:41:26.885]  And your reputation with your customers is your only foundational asset.
[01:41:27.265 --> 01:41:28.006]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:28.226 --> 01:41:29.587]  And here's the deal.
[01:41:30.027 --> 01:41:31.368]  These are big free open companies.
[01:41:31.388 --> 01:41:32.589]  I don't care if they're powerful.
[01:41:32.809 --> 01:41:33.570]  I'm a free market guy.
[01:41:34.150 --> 01:41:35.832]  But they're all moving to China.
[01:41:36.232 --> 01:41:39.154]  Google has been secretly building a censorship engine there and here.
[01:41:39.194 --> 01:41:42.177]  Their own executives went public and leaked it two weeks ago, as you know.
[01:41:42.837 --> 01:41:45.379]  You've got Apple moving their code keys there to be tax exempt.
[01:41:45.639 --> 01:41:47.481]  They are literally wetting themselves
[01:41:47.941 --> 01:41:49.643]  Not in a takeover, but in a marriage.
[01:41:49.723 --> 01:41:53.849]  Big Tech is marrying China because they think it's a safer place to carry this out.
[01:41:53.929 --> 01:41:55.110]  This is outrageous.
[01:41:55.731 --> 01:41:59.917]  Tim Cook is gay and lectures us all day about how we should do whatever he says as he's gay.
[01:41:59.977 --> 01:42:00.637]  Fine, I don't care.
[01:42:00.918 --> 01:42:03.681]  But then he doesn't say a word about China killing gays.
[01:42:03.762 --> 01:42:04.643]  It's unbelievable!
[01:42:06.522 --> 01:42:12.526]  And it is natural, and this is the kind of appeasement that will end up with everybody being eaten by the monsters of their own creation.
[01:42:12.546 --> 01:42:16.789]  We're going to see more media people being attacked by their little vicious pets, Antifa.
[01:42:16.809 --> 01:42:25.235]  We're going to see more people betraying the very principles that gave them the freedom, the economic and political freedom, to build these search engines that's being sold off
[01:42:25.655 --> 01:42:39.026]  To petty bribes by foreign banksters and we have to at some point take a stand for the values that make us great and not continue to sell off our freedoms piece by piece for the next yen, for the next dollar, for the next avoidance of some regulatory problem.
[01:42:39.066 --> 01:42:44.571]  We have to take a stand and the fact that the people who are taking a stand are being silenced is the precursor.
[01:42:44.611 --> 01:42:48.694]  This is the modern book burning which is always a presage to the burning of people.
[01:42:48.814 --> 01:42:49.215]  That's right.
[01:42:49.295 --> 01:42:54.204]  They are killing the Golden Goose right now in some bizarre ritual.
[01:42:54.745 --> 01:42:57.450]  Final segment with Stefan Molyneux, who's on fire straight ahead.
[01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:58.592]  Infowars.com.
[01:42:59.844 --> 01:43:07.107]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[01:43:07.487 --> 01:43:15.010]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:18.491]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[01:43:19.111 --> 01:43:23.376]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[01:43:23.756 --> 01:43:27.680]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:30.623]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[01:43:31.044 --> 01:43:35.328]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[01:43:35.809 --> 01:43:38.872]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[01:43:39.272 --> 01:43:54.102]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[01:43:54.343 --> 01:43:55.644]  That is critical to this fight.
[01:43:55.884 --> 01:43:58.325]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[01:43:59.626 --> 01:44:00.107]  Look at that.
[01:44:00.127 --> 01:44:05.130]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[01:44:05.470 --> 01:44:06.171]  We didn't do that.
[01:44:07.824 --> 01:44:14.069]  If you think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get, I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:44:14.649 --> 01:44:23.196]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:44:23.656 --> 01:44:25.357]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:44:25.398 --> 01:44:26.518]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:44:27.199 --> 01:44:29.721]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:44:29.761 --> 01:44:30.862]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:44:31.622 --> 01:44:34.565]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:44:42.102 --> 01:44:42.442]  Look it up.
[01:44:43.562 --> 01:44:44.043]  Find out.
[01:44:44.063 --> 01:44:49.584]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:44:49.604 --> 01:44:54.466]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[01:44:54.946 --> 01:44:58.027]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products and forestore.com.
[01:44:59.158 --> 01:45:03.423]  We need your support in this epic war against censorship.
[01:45:04.244 --> 01:45:19.042]  You have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost Alex Jones and InfoWars to fight the malicious, baseless harassment lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars across the country.
[01:45:19.822 --> 01:45:23.883]  These stories, these lawsuits have two purposes.
[01:45:24.644 --> 01:45:39.749]  One is to generate vicious negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter, and so on.
[01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:51.058]  It is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight this Soros-funded onslaught against InfoWars.
[01:45:51.939 --> 01:45:53.600]  We cannot do it alone.
[01:45:54.481 --> 01:46:01.867]  Therefore, I ask you to go to the InfoWars site now and find the location where you can make a contribution.
[01:46:02.348 --> 01:46:06.912]  Go to the donation portion of the site and send us.
[01:46:07.832 --> 01:46:11.833]  $50, or $100, or $250, or $500.
[01:46:13.094 --> 01:46:18.355]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 or more.
[01:46:19.195 --> 01:46:19.555]  Why?
[01:46:19.695 --> 01:46:25.357]  Because they know that this is the single most important challenge we face.
[01:46:26.397 --> 01:46:41.031]  Whether we win in 2018 and 2020, whether we can keep the new American Revolution going, whether the free ideas expressed here at InfoWars are allowed to continue are really up to you.
[01:46:41.491 --> 01:46:43.913]  The entire question is up to you.
[01:46:44.554 --> 01:46:45.755]  We need your support.
[01:46:46.355 --> 01:46:49.679]  We do not exaggerate the stakes or the dangers.
[01:46:50.099 --> 01:46:51.660]  We are not crying wolf.
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:57.927]  Please go to the Infowars.com site now and support us with your dollars.
[01:47:03.655 --> 01:47:06.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:27.267]  We are back live.
[01:47:27.307 --> 01:47:29.249]  Stefan Molyneux is with us for this segment and one more.
[01:47:29.269 --> 01:47:33.151]  And I've got a bunch of geopolitical news and some crazy stuff next hour.
[01:47:33.191 --> 01:47:44.758]  But Stefan, we were saying a lot during the break about what's coming next, what they're going to do, marching on YouTube if they keep censoring, if they ban your channel, where all this is going.
[01:47:44.778 --> 01:47:50.902]  And you were also talking about people that want to stick their head down, think they're going to wait it out or play patty cake like the Ben Shapiros.
[01:47:51.202 --> 01:47:52.983]  They're already getting censored now, too.
[01:47:53.023 --> 01:47:56.285]  Don't they understand that authoritarians follow a methodology?
[01:47:58.882 --> 01:47:59.202]  Don't they?
[01:48:00.223 --> 01:48:01.163]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[01:48:01.243 --> 01:48:05.285]  And, you know, the old Churchill quote that an appeasement is the hope that the crocodile will eat you last.
[01:48:05.785 --> 01:48:09.967]  So, you know, I saw when you got banned, a bunch of people were like, well, I don't agree with everything Alex Jones says.
[01:48:09.987 --> 01:48:11.708]  It's like, well, yeah, welcome to adulthood.
[01:48:11.728 --> 01:48:13.929]  We don't agree with everything that each other says.
[01:48:13.969 --> 01:48:15.169]  That's the whole point of free speech.
[01:48:15.209 --> 01:48:16.830]  If we all agreed, we'd be in North Korea.
[01:48:17.470 --> 01:48:22.694]  And so the fact that people say, well, I want to back away from endorsing, but I want to support the very vague principle.
[01:48:22.734 --> 01:48:23.354]  It's like, no, no, no.
[01:48:23.594 --> 01:48:25.956]  You have to stand with people who are being banned.
[01:48:25.976 --> 01:48:28.077]  You have to stand with people who are being deplatformed.
[01:48:28.478 --> 01:48:36.343]  The idea that somehow you're going to be missed, that they're just going to step over you and not notice that you're big and prominent or anything that you say, it's not going to happen.
[01:48:36.623 --> 01:48:37.524]  It's going to be you next.
[01:48:37.564 --> 01:48:42.447]  You need to stand with the people who are the least popular in their own mind, because of course that's the people they're going to go for first.
[01:48:42.767 --> 01:48:45.349]  But if you don't stand with us, you will fall next.
[01:48:45.469 --> 01:48:47.110]  And there'll be far fewer people to stand with you.
[01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:53.054]  Well, also, they build a straw man off, literally, none of what they say about me is even real.
[01:48:53.455 --> 01:48:59.979]  But they ran, I'm not exaggerating, we looked it up, over 130,000 articles the last year and a half, lying about me.
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:02.121]  It's never even with quotes on it.
[01:49:02.381 --> 01:49:06.144]  They just say, he's an anti-Semite, he's racist, he said this, he said that.
[01:49:06.504 --> 01:49:07.885]  He says, you know, he bullies kids.
[01:49:07.905 --> 01:49:09.026]  None of it's even true!
[01:49:09.346 --> 01:49:15.251]  And that's what's scary is, the mainstream media, after they lost the election, they went and said, oh, it's not lying that got us beat.
[01:49:15.551 --> 01:49:16.532]  We didn't lie enough.
[01:49:18.146 --> 01:49:31.954]  Well, and the fact that the Russia investigation collusion nonsense seems to be falling apart with people getting fired and people quitting and people losing credibility and so on and no collusion after, what, 18 months or more of this relentless investigation.
[01:49:31.994 --> 01:49:39.058]  So the fact that they're running out of this red flag Russia thing means that they then have to go for prominent people who've been pointing it out.
[01:49:39.358 --> 01:50:06.577]  pointing out that it was nonsense all along and they just have to silence people and that is a chilling and terrifying thing and we need to push back against this stuff not just for the basic pride in free speech but because if they silence us and try to silence us as you've seen gives the Streisand effect you know you hit a crater you don't destroy the building the building gets bigger and stronger you know the Obi-Wan line if you cut me down I shall come back stronger than you've ever imagined that's going to happen so the question is if this doesn't work and it probably won't
[01:50:07.077 --> 01:50:08.418]  What are they going to do next?
[01:50:08.458 --> 01:50:09.199]  They're not going to stop.
[01:50:09.239 --> 01:50:11.661]  So we have to stop them here on the deplatforming.
[01:50:11.761 --> 01:50:14.203]  Otherwise, they're going to just continue to escalate.
[01:50:14.483 --> 01:50:15.944]  And then you said during the break, you said next.
[01:50:16.024 --> 01:50:16.584]  I said, what's next?
[01:50:16.625 --> 01:50:17.305]  You go violence.
[01:50:17.465 --> 01:50:20.387]  And it already is the violence of them calling me a terrorist.
[01:50:20.728 --> 01:50:23.610]  The violence of them saying Alex Jones wants to attack the media.
[01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:24.811]  But I'm saying the opposite.
[01:50:24.831 --> 01:50:26.332]  I think they might false flag themselves.
[01:50:26.732 --> 01:50:28.774]  And then they edit stuff together and lie.
[01:50:28.854 --> 01:50:32.377]  I mean, I've never... Stefan, they're like lying 10 times worse than ever.
[01:50:32.457 --> 01:50:35.239]  I mean, the lies are such whoppers.
[01:50:35.319 --> 01:50:36.540]  It actually takes my breath away.
[01:50:37.611 --> 01:50:38.492]  Well, here's the thing, right?
[01:50:38.532 --> 01:50:43.855]  So they have established this principle that violence against Nazis is perfectly acceptable.
[01:50:43.895 --> 01:50:45.416]  Now that is wrong.
[01:50:45.656 --> 01:50:50.119]  I mean, I hate Nazis as much as the next guy, but that doesn't mean you get to punch them in the head.
[01:50:50.139 --> 01:50:54.142]  So the first thing they do, of course, is they say, punching a Nazi is A-OK with us.
[01:50:54.462 --> 01:50:56.223]  Punching a racist is A-OK with us.
[01:50:56.263 --> 01:50:57.584]  Punching a white nationalist.
[01:50:57.904 --> 01:51:03.508]  And then what they do is they just apply these labels randomly to people they want to hurt or want to have people hurt.
[01:51:04.228 --> 01:51:07.449]  And it's like that, you know, like you paint the laser and then the rocket kind of hits.
[01:51:07.489 --> 01:51:10.470]  So they keep hitting us with these negative adjectives, which are false.
[01:51:10.971 --> 01:51:18.253]  And then what they do is they attempt to rouse the mob in such a frenzy that you have physical danger going out in public.
[01:51:18.353 --> 01:51:22.675]  I had to have security go with me everywhere I went in Australia.
[01:51:22.695 --> 01:51:23.475]  Oh, I meant to go there.
[01:51:23.535 --> 01:51:23.955]  I forgot.
[01:51:23.995 --> 01:51:25.636]  Tell folks, we roll some of the video in the background.
[01:51:25.936 --> 01:51:27.917]  Laura Southern, you had people jumping on the stage.
[01:51:28.197 --> 01:51:30.798]  We have video of them trying to overturn buses screaming Nazi.
[01:51:32.119 --> 01:51:40.723]  Yeah, so the feral protesters attacked the buses, ripped the sides of buses, tried to tip buses over with people inside, threw things at the windows of buses.
[01:51:40.843 --> 01:51:42.584]  They were absolutely frenzied.
[01:51:43.004 --> 01:51:52.329]  And then, of course, yeah, when Lauren was giving her speech, a protester rushed to the stage to attack her, we can assume, and got intercepted and somewhat crunched by security.
[01:51:52.369 --> 01:51:55.931]  Now, after that, they were kind of meek as lambs and were just yelling out here and there.
[01:51:56.631 --> 01:51:58.833]  And it is, it is terrible.
[01:51:58.933 --> 01:52:04.798]  It is a ridiculous situation to be presenting facts, reason and evidence and face violence for opening your mouth.
[01:52:04.899 --> 01:52:09.222]  And if we don't stop this now, I'm telling people, if we don't stop this now, we know where this leads.
[01:52:10.003 --> 01:52:12.605]  And you can't make it up that Soros literally funds it.
[01:52:13.406 --> 01:52:15.828]  And then he gets away with all this.
[01:52:17.951 --> 01:52:22.354]  I don't want to keep taking Trump to the woodshed because I think overall he's done a lot, but I know people that know him really well.
[01:52:22.454 --> 01:52:29.998]  He is so self-confident that he thinks he can overpower things and doesn't want to sound weak and say, hey, stop censoring, stop blocking.
[01:52:30.478 --> 01:52:32.999]  He thinks it's all about acting confident for the economy.
[01:52:33.059 --> 01:52:36.381]  And he may be right, maybe we're wrong, but they're stealing the First Amendment.
[01:52:36.681 --> 01:52:38.082]  They're doing it to all his supporters.
[01:52:38.102 --> 01:52:39.503]  They're dialing back all his speeches.
[01:52:40.123 --> 01:52:41.345]  He has a responsibility.
[01:52:41.405 --> 01:52:53.121]  It is a campaign donation in kind to the Democrats to shadow ban or ban all of us, clearly ahead of the midterms, and then to tell us that we're colluding with the Russians with no proof when Hillary's up to her eyeballs with Uranium One.
[01:52:53.161 --> 01:52:56.887]  I mean, they are election meddling right now.
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:59.101]  Oh, no doubt.
[01:52:59.161 --> 01:53:08.887]  I mean, the timing of this is so completely and blatantly obvious that it is an attempt to rig the election by de-platforming people who speak out against the Democrats.
[01:53:08.947 --> 01:53:19.393]  That is, I mean, anybody who doesn't understand that should just log off and pick up an ABC book on logic and just try to reason that one through because there's no doubt that this is a form of election and political meddling.
[01:53:19.513 --> 01:53:26.818]  And yeah, listen, I'll tell you, but quite frankly, I mean, I'm sure most Americans appreciate the tax cuts and they appreciate the low unemployment and I think that's all wonderful.
[01:53:27.538 --> 01:53:33.421]  But relative to our freedoms, the economy is relatively inconsequential because the economy is a result of the freedoms that we have.
[01:53:33.441 --> 01:53:34.161]  That's what generates it.
[01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.022]  Yeah, that's what generates it.
[01:53:36.062 --> 01:53:42.644]  So if you boost the economy while allowing the freedoms to fall away... You're actually feeding the commies.
[01:53:43.465 --> 01:53:46.166]  Yeah, you are killing the goose that's laying the golden egg.
[01:53:46.206 --> 01:53:56.350]  So a little bit less focus on the tax cuts and a little bit more focus on free speech, I think, would entirely be welcome, not just from the Trump administration, but all the administrations across the West.
[01:53:57.239 --> 01:54:06.404]  Well, I wasn't yelling at one of their high-level folks last week, but I did get serious and I said, listen, I know the reports are up there, I know they know, get on it.
[01:54:06.944 --> 01:54:12.947]  Trump put one tweet out about Twitter being illegal, shadowbanning, everybody else is doing it even worse, and he stopped it.
[01:54:13.187 --> 01:54:14.528]  I saw my tweets go from 100 back to 10,000.
[01:54:14.708 --> 01:54:17.309]  Dorsey goes, are they shadowbanned?
[01:54:17.329 --> 01:54:17.850]  And went and did it.
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.541]  I know folks that had dinner with Dorsey after, and he says, my employees are out of control.
[01:54:22.202 --> 01:54:24.943]  So, pressure makes them back off.
[01:54:25.223 --> 01:54:28.844]  When the wolves are around the campfire, laying there with your neck out has them bite you.
[01:54:29.084 --> 01:54:30.285]  You get the torch in your hand.
[01:54:30.325 --> 01:54:33.706]  You don't just sit there and, you know, spread your butt to them.
[01:54:33.746 --> 01:54:35.187]  I'm sorry to say that, but that's what's happening.
[01:54:36.267 --> 01:54:38.608]  Well, let me tell you, Alex, this goes out to you and to your audience.
[01:54:38.628 --> 01:54:41.470]  I think you get this very viscerally, but I really want the audience to understand.
[01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:43.631]  Three kinds of people in this world, my friend.
[01:54:43.851 --> 01:54:44.391]  There are the sheep,
[01:54:45.310 --> 01:54:47.312]  There are the sheepdogs and there are the wolves.
[01:54:47.613 --> 01:54:56.783]  And people like you and I are trying ferociously and peacefully and reasonably and with every fiber of our being to keep the sheep safe from the Marxist wolves.
[01:54:57.063 --> 01:55:01.268]  We are the sheepdogs attempting to keep the predators at bay and you need to stand with us.
[01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:03.029]  Because if they break through us,
[01:55:03.931 --> 01:55:04.692]  It's hell for the herd.
[01:55:05.272 --> 01:55:05.992]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:55:06.052 --> 01:55:08.614]  If they can take me down, because they know we're entrenched.
[01:55:08.734 --> 01:55:10.375]  I mean, we've been waiting for this for a long time.
[01:55:10.415 --> 01:55:14.017]  We've got all sorts of backups and TV, radio, and backups here, you know.
[01:55:14.918 --> 01:55:17.259]  They know if they can get us, they can get everybody.
[01:55:17.339 --> 01:55:22.482]  And as soon as Congress didn't act when we got taken down, they have gone crazy censoring everybody.
[01:55:22.883 --> 01:55:25.944]  I mean, it's 5,000 times what it was two weeks ago, Stefan.
[01:55:27.185 --> 01:55:30.027]  Well, and to the people in charge who say their employees are out of control.
[01:55:30.771 --> 01:55:31.352]  Be a leader.
[01:55:31.852 --> 01:55:33.615]  For God's sakes, be a leader.
[01:55:33.975 --> 01:55:36.618]  Get your employees back in line with free speech.
[01:55:36.799 --> 01:55:39.862]  If this means that you have to go through and say, hey, do you like free speech?
[01:55:39.902 --> 01:55:41.324]  And everyone who says, no, I hate it.
[01:55:41.685 --> 01:55:43.807]  Maybe you can just show them a quick exit door.
[01:55:44.168 --> 01:55:46.030]  But you need to clean up this mess.
[01:55:46.170 --> 01:55:47.151]  You are the leader.
[01:55:47.191 --> 01:55:48.353]  You are paid by the shareholders.
[01:55:48.373 --> 01:55:49.134]  You are paid well.
[01:55:50.435 --> 01:56:01.767]  And you've hit the key, just like universities are down 30% with the SJW thing, they destroy themselves, as the most radical becomes who's in charge, so they just start demanding more and more and more.
[01:56:01.987 --> 01:56:04.129]  Don't say mother and father on Twitter, ban them!
[01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:10.957]  And it's like a crazy group of pirates running around insanely reading our private messages, leaking them, doing whatever they want.
[01:56:10.977 --> 01:56:11.958]  It's like, stop it!
[01:56:13.294 --> 01:56:24.518]  Yeah, I mean, can you imagine the generals in Eisenhower before D-Day or Churchill saying, well, you know, we just, we can't seem to get the troops all on the same page and some of them don't want to go and it's like, look, you're the leader.
[01:56:24.538 --> 01:56:31.141]  I mean, you're the leader of a free market institution, so it's not directly analogous to the military, but for heaven's sake, step up and be in charge.
[01:56:31.181 --> 01:56:32.402]  That's what you're paid for.
[01:56:32.782 --> 01:56:38.124]  Maintain the foundational values, not just of your company, but of your civilization that gave it birth.
[01:56:39.377 --> 01:56:41.838]  We're going to do five more minutes with Stefan Molyneux on the other side.
[01:56:42.038 --> 01:56:43.978]  Artoftheargument.com is the book.
[01:56:43.998 --> 01:56:44.879]  He's got a new book coming out.
[01:56:45.199 --> 01:56:45.839]  Want to hear about that?
[01:56:45.879 --> 01:56:47.680]  Have him back and sell the book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:48.120 --> 01:56:48.800]  Don't forget us.
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:50.661]  They are trying to shut us down.
[01:56:51.221 --> 01:56:52.261]  You are who fund us.
[01:56:52.281 --> 01:56:53.362]  We have basically no sponsors.
[01:56:53.382 --> 01:56:53.962]  They've taken them all.
[01:56:53.982 --> 01:56:56.583]  The network has some, GCN, but that's their thing.
[01:56:56.603 --> 01:56:57.643]  They're just a provider.
[01:56:58.643 --> 01:57:00.764]  We need you to buy products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:02.165 --> 01:57:04.506]  Fight the Bullies, Save the Internet, Save Info, we're super special.
[01:57:04.526 --> 01:57:07.888]  We were already running this a few weeks ago and they were just starting to ban us.
[01:57:07.908 --> 01:57:10.349]  Sales got to end soon as we're about to sell out of DNA Force Plus.
[01:57:11.189 --> 01:57:13.390]  50% off, that's very close to what it cost to make it.
[01:57:13.670 --> 01:57:14.811]  Secret 12, 40% off.
[01:57:14.931 --> 01:57:17.012]  X2, which we're running low on, 40% off.
[01:57:17.632 --> 01:57:21.273]  And the great books and videos and Patriot t-shirts to spread the word.
[01:57:21.333 --> 01:57:22.074]  Mulan Labe.
[01:57:23.494 --> 01:57:24.095]  It's all there.
[01:57:24.295 --> 01:57:26.096]  I am the resistance, one of our new best-selling shirts.
[01:57:26.416 --> 01:57:28.897]  But just please commit to financially support us.
[01:57:28.937 --> 01:57:32.899]  And I know we can beat all the fake lawsuits, the attacks, the deplatforming.
[01:57:32.919 --> 01:57:34.480]  But now they're saying I'm a terrorist.
[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:35.961]  Now they're saying arrest me.
[01:57:36.401 --> 01:57:37.121]  All over the news.
[01:57:37.221 --> 01:57:39.903]  I mean, they are going crazy ahead of some big event.
[01:57:40.363 --> 01:57:43.024]  And I'm gonna ask Stefan, what tricks do you think they'll play?
[01:57:43.284 --> 01:57:44.285]  We're back in two minutes.
[01:57:44.365 --> 01:57:45.585]  Then we'll get into all the other news.
[01:57:45.905 --> 01:57:47.646]  Whatever you do, tell folks how you're listening.
[01:57:47.686 --> 01:57:48.647]  That is so critical.
[01:57:51.411 --> 01:57:55.734]  All these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it.
[01:57:55.814 --> 01:57:56.575]  So I'm here.
[01:57:56.595 --> 01:57:57.175]  Hammering.
[01:57:57.595 --> 01:57:57.896]  Hammering.
[01:57:58.256 --> 01:57:58.636]  Hammering.
[01:57:58.916 --> 01:57:59.657]  Hammering.
[01:57:59.677 --> 01:58:00.598]  Stop the hammering.
[01:58:01.058 --> 01:58:02.539]  Stop the hammering out there.
[01:58:02.579 --> 01:58:03.419]  Who's got a hammer?
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.200]  Where is it?
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:04.860]  Hammering.
[01:58:05.201 --> 01:58:05.581]  Hammering.
[01:58:05.861 --> 01:58:06.241]  Hammering.
[01:58:06.522 --> 01:58:06.902]  Hammering.
[01:58:07.322 --> 01:58:08.223]  Where's the hammer?
[01:58:09.023 --> 01:58:10.865]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[01:58:10.965 --> 01:58:13.106]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:13.627]  Hammering.
[01:58:13.947 --> 01:58:14.327]  Hammering.
[01:58:14.607 --> 01:58:14.988]  Hammering.
[01:58:15.268 --> 01:58:15.668]  Hammering.
[01:58:15.948 --> 01:58:16.328]  Hammering.
[01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:18.310]  Stop the hammering!
[01:58:21.454 --> 01:58:22.715]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[01:58:22.735 --> 01:58:24.397]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[01:58:24.537 --> 01:58:26.018]  Stop the hammering!
[01:58:26.318 --> 01:58:27.319]  Hammering, hammering.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:32.383]  And all these fools, and all these traitors don't get it.
[01:58:32.944 --> 01:58:39.369]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control of the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:41.972]  It just f***ing sucks.
[01:58:42.312 --> 01:58:46.575]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[01:58:47.256 --> 01:58:48.116]  Control the churches.
[01:58:48.336 --> 01:58:49.337]  Control the food you eat.
[01:58:49.537 --> 01:58:51.077]  Control the vaccines they put in your body.
[01:58:51.377 --> 01:58:52.157]  Control the internet.
[01:58:52.397 --> 01:58:53.178]  Control everything.
[01:58:53.218 --> 01:58:53.598]  They're here.
[01:58:54.078 --> 01:58:56.979]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[01:58:57.039 --> 01:58:57.779]  That's what I know.
[01:58:58.439 --> 01:59:01.520]  Anybody can get into my f***ing ear at any time.
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:07.501]  Our supplements, our products, our t-shirts, all of it is Choose Your Own Adventure at Infowarshore.com.
[01:59:07.801 --> 01:59:08.722]  Standing with America.
[01:59:08.742 --> 01:59:10.742]  Standing against the Chi-Coms in Hollywood.
[01:59:10.962 --> 01:59:12.382]  Standing for victory and winning.
[01:59:12.563 --> 01:59:13.103]  Thanks to you.
[01:59:13.203 --> 01:59:13.683]  We'll be back.
[01:59:14.543 --> 01:59:17.624]  I'll go down to the g***** floor myself and stop it.
[01:59:17.664 --> 01:59:19.445]  Keep the g***** commercial break going.
[01:59:19.945 --> 01:59:23.647]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:59:23.787 --> 01:59:28.849]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[01:59:29.029 --> 01:59:30.209]  And here's the best part.
[01:59:30.349 --> 01:59:31.930]  It is absolutely free.
[01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:37.032]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[01:59:37.372 --> 01:59:41.034]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:59:41.114 --> 01:59:45.237]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:59:45.457 --> 01:59:49.819]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:59:53.421 --> 01:59:57.383]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:13.604 --> 02:00:16.605]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:00:17.265 --> 02:00:19.526]  Run on for a long time.
[02:00:20.226 --> 02:00:20.866]  Run on for a long time.
[02:00:20.966 --> 02:00:24.407]  Alright, Dr. McCann, shot please for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[02:00:24.667 --> 02:00:26.208]  We have a bunch of Twitter accounts.
[02:00:26.768 --> 02:00:30.089]  And they've been basically useless for six months with undershadow bands.
[02:00:30.649 --> 02:00:32.390]  But we still pump stuff out on them.
[02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:40.053]  And so, we have 200 plus radio affiliates, we have 400 plus TV affiliates, we have over 100 cable affiliates.
[02:00:40.973 --> 02:00:44.975]  The Streisand effect in the last year of the censorship's made those expand wildly.
[02:00:44.995 --> 02:00:47.976]  And it's expensive satellites and it goes out, we get a big response.
[02:00:49.036 --> 02:00:53.738]  We just met with a bunch of TV executives in Houston yesterday, my team did, and a lot of folks are coming through.
[02:00:54.018 --> 02:00:58.400]  So, the internet we think is the only place to watch things, and the globalists have focused on that, but
[02:00:59.517 --> 02:01:04.642]  They took my Twitter down yesterday saying that I threatened to use a battle rifle on the mainstream media.
[02:01:04.722 --> 02:01:06.103]  Never said that, never did that.
[02:01:06.804 --> 02:01:08.586]  Even Media Matters links to it, it's not true.
[02:01:08.606 --> 02:01:10.808]  I said we politically have to move against these folks.
[02:01:11.168 --> 02:01:13.250]  If Antifa has you listed, they're gonna attack you.
[02:01:13.270 --> 02:01:17.615]  You gotta have a rifle at your home, protect yourself, but don't be offensive.
[02:01:19.437 --> 02:01:31.406]  The rules say you can't go on that platform, so we streamed on the InfoWars platform, just like we did on YouTube, and later they said, oh, you're totally banned, because we said you couldn't use this account, now you can't use that account.
[02:01:31.767 --> 02:01:37.932]  So now, and I'm just not going to stream on the other accounts then, I'm going to play by their games, because I'm going to have to take legal action just because this is getting out of control.
[02:01:39.233 --> 02:01:41.875]  It says, we've temporarily limited some of your account features.
[02:01:43.482 --> 02:01:49.673]  Violating our rules against abusive behavior, you may not engage in targeted harassment or someone or incite other people.
[02:01:51.087 --> 02:01:51.307]  Well, look.
[02:02:16.497 --> 02:02:17.378]  You're part of it.
[02:02:17.438 --> 02:02:21.259]  The employees in the big tech companies, Alex, they're part of a larger political machinery.
[02:02:22.040 --> 02:02:32.965]  I think what's happened is, if you remember back to the Trayvon Martin-George Zimmerman incident, right, the death of Trayvon Martin, the media spun that in a way that was fairly easy to falsify and
[02:02:33.761 --> 02:02:39.883]  I certainly did a very popular video, over a million views and downloads, of that, debunking that kind of myth.
[02:02:39.943 --> 02:02:53.007]  So the fact that the media can't race bait as well anymore, because you can dismantle these lies in real time, with a bigger audience sometimes than, I mean, I have more subscribers, you have more subscribers than many of the mainstream media outlets.
[02:02:53.267 --> 02:02:54.287]  And they don't like that.
[02:02:54.387 --> 02:02:56.408]  CNN doesn't like that.
[02:02:56.768 --> 02:03:00.789]  We can undo the lies that they're saying in real time, and that's why
[02:03:01.647 --> 02:03:09.789]  They have to deplatform us because I think they want to continue to have the ability to lie and to manipulate and to race bait and to gender bait and to class bait and so on.
[02:03:10.089 --> 02:03:18.190]  And the fact that we can dismantle these hideous statues in real time means that we have to be silenced so that their falsehoods can continue unopposed and unchecked.
[02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:22.431]  And that's what's in common, is people who are pushing back against media lies.
[02:03:22.571 --> 02:03:25.212]  That is what is in common, I think, with the people who are being deplatformed.
[02:03:26.021 --> 02:03:27.203]  What do you think Twitter's doing?
[02:03:27.223 --> 02:03:33.433]  Just toying with me before a total ban, where they just... And then they have all these CNN reporters saying, ban him, ban him, like I'm a witch.
[02:03:33.494 --> 02:03:36.218]  They're all like a Monty Python skit saying, burn me at the stake.
[02:03:36.258 --> 02:03:37.580]  I mean, it's getting ridiculous.
[02:03:38.604 --> 02:03:38.884]  It is.
[02:03:39.104 --> 02:03:39.384]  It is.
[02:03:39.524 --> 02:03:45.485]  And this kind of hysteria is because I think that they are facing a very resurgent economy.
[02:03:45.525 --> 02:03:49.846]  They're facing low black and Hispanic unemployment, which was a traditional base, right?
[02:03:50.086 --> 02:03:54.107]  The blacks and Hispanics who traditionally would vote for Democrats are getting a taste of the free market.
[02:03:55.027 --> 02:03:58.008]  Now they're not dependent on welfare as much, but they're actually making money.
[02:03:58.068 --> 02:04:02.949]  Well, they're going to be interested in lower taxes and smaller government rather than bigger taxes and more government.
[02:04:02.989 --> 02:04:03.989]  So there's a huge shift.
[02:04:04.449 --> 02:04:07.111]  That is going on, particularly in some minority communities.
[02:04:07.672 --> 02:04:09.353]  And how do they lure them back?
[02:04:09.413 --> 02:04:12.175]  Do they lure them back and say, well, you don't really want that job, do you?
[02:04:12.195 --> 02:04:18.100]  Wouldn't you rather be better off in government assistance and unemployment and food stamps and welfare and Section 8 housing?
[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:19.961]  No, they got a taste of the free market.
[02:04:19.981 --> 02:04:21.923]  They got a taste of productivity, which is wonderful.
[02:04:21.963 --> 02:04:24.305]  And everyone who knew the free market knew that this was
[02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:29.232]  ...result of Trump, so they're losing their core base, so they have to start lashing out and attacking.
[02:04:29.652 --> 02:04:32.193]  Otherwise, they ain't gonna do so well in November.
[02:04:32.553 --> 02:04:32.833]  Wow.
[02:04:32.933 --> 02:04:34.173]  Stefan Molyneux.
[02:04:34.613 --> 02:04:35.294]  Freedomainradio.com.
[02:04:35.314 --> 02:04:37.194]  More important than ever to know his domains.
[02:04:37.754 --> 02:04:38.694]  He's banned off YouTube.
[02:04:39.114 --> 02:04:40.555]  And Artoftheargument.com.
[02:04:40.615 --> 02:04:41.635]  And his new book's coming out soon.
[02:04:41.655 --> 02:04:42.355]  We'll have it back on.
[02:04:42.735 --> 02:04:43.936]  Stefan, God bless.
[02:04:43.956 --> 02:04:44.916]  We appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:46.220]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:04:46.261 --> 02:04:46.721]  Great pleasure.
[02:04:47.081 --> 02:04:47.341]  All right.
[02:04:47.421 --> 02:04:55.088]  We'll be back on the other side with a very special guest, a big CIA whistleblower, who's being... Well, wait till you hear this.
[02:04:55.128 --> 02:04:57.510]  Tosh Plumlee, back from South America.
[02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:04.672]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:05:04.833 --> 02:05:09.896]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:05:10.056 --> 02:05:11.237]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:11.357 --> 02:05:13.018]  It is absolutely free.
[02:05:13.198 --> 02:05:18.161]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:05:18.422 --> 02:05:22.064]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:05:22.364 --> 02:05:26.287]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:05:26.507 --> 02:05:30.630]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:35.331]  We have the new t-shirt we're selling because they have Impeach Trump 45 at Walmart.
[02:05:35.351 --> 02:05:38.391]  We have Reelect Trump at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:38.432 --> 02:05:39.472]  Reelect 45.
[02:05:40.312 --> 02:05:43.092]  So it's Reelect, not the other one.
[02:05:43.132 --> 02:05:44.293]  That's now exclusively available.
[02:05:44.453 --> 02:05:45.993]  They're getting printed right here, right here in Texas.
[02:05:46.313 --> 02:05:47.133]  Shipped out next week.
[02:05:47.153 --> 02:05:47.893]  Get your order in now.
[02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:48.954]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:48.994 --> 02:05:49.554]  No reviews yet.
[02:05:49.574 --> 02:05:50.254]  We just launched today.
[02:05:50.274 --> 02:05:52.834]  And then we have, we have Mean Like a Wolverine.
[02:05:52.854 --> 02:05:55.055]  It's not the Marvel comic wimpy Wolverine.
[02:05:55.115 --> 02:05:56.195]  It's the Trump Wolverine.
[02:05:56.475 --> 02:05:58.395]  That's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:58.576 --> 02:06:00.576]  Be sure and get those and fund the operation.
[02:06:04.318 --> 02:06:06.480]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:12.145]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:32.081]  The circle is now complete.
[02:06:32.201 --> 02:06:34.202]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[02:06:34.342 --> 02:06:36.163]  Now I am the master.
[02:06:36.863 --> 02:06:38.584]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[02:06:42.085 --> 02:06:43.966]  Your power's a weak old man.
[02:06:44.006 --> 02:06:46.087]  You can't win, Darth.
[02:06:46.987 --> 02:06:51.429]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[02:07:01.112 --> 02:07:05.233]  No!
[02:07:05.313 --> 02:07:26.319]  We are number one trending app in news.
[02:07:26.599 --> 02:07:27.439]  Number one
[02:07:29.096 --> 02:07:29.416]  We're trending.
[02:07:29.936 --> 02:07:31.657]  Click on that for a larger image, please.
[02:07:32.558 --> 02:07:34.458]  Number one trending.
[02:07:34.919 --> 02:07:37.820]  Guess what we are total out of thousands of news apps?
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:46.944]  We are number three total in the world surpassing CNN and Fox News.
[02:07:52.986 --> 02:07:56.748]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:08:01.737 --> 02:08:13.280]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... It's Alex Jones!
[02:08:13.300 --> 02:08:14.520]  Scum!
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:17.661]  Russian scum!
[02:08:17.701 --> 02:08:23.202]  It all always comes to mind.
[02:08:27.298 --> 02:08:28.741]  Your reputation is amazing.
[02:08:29.202 --> 02:08:30.525]  I will not let you down.
[02:08:30.685 --> 02:08:33.591]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:40.720]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:41.861]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[02:08:42.001 --> 02:08:42.661]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:42.801 --> 02:08:43.521]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:43.601 --> 02:08:44.241]  Alex Jones.
[02:08:44.341 --> 02:08:47.242]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[02:08:47.282 --> 02:08:56.804]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[02:08:56.844 --> 02:08:58.625]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[02:08:58.725 --> 02:09:02.446]  It's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[02:09:03.917 --> 02:09:08.062]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:09:08.222 --> 02:09:08.603]  J.F.
[02:09:08.683 --> 02:09:11.326]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[02:09:11.346 --> 02:09:15.651]  It was almost as if it were a plant imploded with just pancakes.
[02:09:15.711 --> 02:09:20.397]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the front porch.
[02:09:21.197 --> 02:09:22.939]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[02:09:23.239 --> 02:09:30.266]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[02:09:30.506 --> 02:09:31.527]  UFOs!
[02:09:31.607 --> 02:09:33.489]  Is this global governance at last?
[02:09:33.769 --> 02:09:34.690]  Is it one world?
[02:09:34.770 --> 02:09:36.171]  The central bank is in charge.
[02:09:36.251 --> 02:09:41.676]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[02:09:41.736 --> 02:09:45.079]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[02:09:45.239 --> 02:09:50.764]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[02:09:50.864 --> 02:09:52.125]  Russian scum!
[02:09:52.366 --> 02:09:53.166]  Denied everything.
[02:09:53.226 --> 02:09:54.648]  He called it all fake news.
[02:09:54.688 --> 02:09:57.510]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:59.692]  This is a national emergency.
[02:09:59.712 --> 02:10:05.337]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[02:10:05.397 --> 02:10:07.459]  This is a FEMA high-level election.
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:10.882]  We are at war with Russia.
[02:10:10.962 --> 02:10:16.247]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[02:10:16.287 --> 02:10:19.390]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[02:10:19.650 --> 02:10:21.451]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[02:10:22.492 --> 02:10:26.376]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:10:27.276 --> 02:10:28.978]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:10:32.621 --> 02:10:35.464]  Okay, Tosh Plumlee will be with us in the next segment.
[02:10:36.519 --> 02:10:38.720]  He's one of the most famous CIA whistleblowers.
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:44.162]  Smoked cigars and drank rum with Phil Castro back when he worked for the CIA.
[02:10:44.702 --> 02:10:46.502]  Flying weapons in the late 50s to Cuba.
[02:10:47.103 --> 02:10:51.264]  Only retired from flying CIA contracting a decade or so ago.
[02:10:52.804 --> 02:10:59.047]  And he now does other training that's at 80-something, 82 years old, that's clandestine.
[02:10:59.067 --> 02:11:00.067]  Won't get into here on air.
[02:11:01.792 --> 02:11:08.773]  But he got a call from his federal source, and he was one of the first people to break Benghazi and the weapons transfer up to Syria, all later confirmed.
[02:11:09.233 --> 02:11:10.734]  Colonel Schaber confirmed it around the same time.
[02:11:11.414 --> 02:11:16.275]  They've now been given calls that he's under criminal investigation, so am I, for national security violation.
[02:11:16.675 --> 02:11:22.396]  That'd be the deep state for reporting on Hillary shipping weapons to ISIS, back then known as Al Qaeda, so whatever.
[02:11:22.416 --> 02:11:24.596]  I mean, hell, put me on trial for that.
[02:11:25.997 --> 02:11:26.617]  Didn't do that.
[02:11:26.737 --> 02:11:28.317]  It was open source information.
[02:11:30.018 --> 02:11:33.222]  I've had a couple of heroes of Benghazi right in here in this chair right next to me.
[02:11:33.242 --> 02:11:35.004]  So, they've said the same thing and arrest them.
[02:11:36.086 --> 02:11:37.287]  But that's how they operate.
[02:11:37.307 --> 02:11:39.029]  But that said, that's coming up next segment.
[02:11:39.089 --> 02:11:42.013]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:11:42.033 --> 02:11:43.094]  You know, I mentioned the sites.
[02:11:44.355 --> 02:11:45.417]  They took away our comments.
[02:11:45.457 --> 02:11:46.478]  That was Discuss Us.
[02:11:46.558 --> 02:11:47.779]  Thousands of comments per article.
[02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:50.449]  In that community, very, very popular.
[02:11:50.469 --> 02:11:52.110]  They took away us able to email you.
[02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:52.850]  We got that back.
[02:11:52.870 --> 02:12:00.113]  They're trying to take away our ability to even pay to stream our video directly to you at Infowars.com forward slash shub.
[02:12:01.453 --> 02:12:06.375]  Twitter left us on, I guess, to do this whole elaborate thing where they act like that game is due process.
[02:12:07.535 --> 02:12:09.456]  Then they lie about what we've said and what we've done.
[02:12:09.476 --> 02:12:14.037]  You know, CNN says, Jones says he has battle rifles for the news.
[02:12:14.977 --> 02:12:15.738]  You'll watch the video.
[02:12:15.758 --> 02:12:16.418]  It's not even true.
[02:12:18.302 --> 02:12:21.643]  And then we have another sub-account, and the way the rules work, you get banned on each account.
[02:12:22.063 --> 02:12:23.904]  Well, they said, oh, that's banned, too, for seven days.
[02:12:23.964 --> 02:12:25.424]  So, that'll be all over the news.
[02:12:25.664 --> 02:12:26.785]  Oh, he got banned again!
[02:12:27.025 --> 02:12:27.925]  He got caught again!
[02:12:27.985 --> 02:12:28.785]  He won't stop!
[02:12:30.166 --> 02:12:32.926]  The video was my message to President Trump to stop censorship.
[02:12:34.307 --> 02:12:36.888]  And I said, Antifa's threatening to kill people.
[02:12:37.508 --> 02:12:44.210]  Can we queue up that two-minute tape I never got to where, you know, last weekend at the White House, Antifa says they're going to kill everybody and they're coming to your houses.
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:47.742]  And I said, folks, Andy, if it's serious, they might do it.
[02:12:47.782 --> 02:12:51.025]  You need to be able to protect yourself if they come to your home, but we need to be peaceful and try to fix this.
[02:12:51.065 --> 02:12:55.329]  I think the mainstream media may do a false flag on themselves to make themselves look like victims.
[02:12:55.349 --> 02:12:59.192]  They're hyping it, and then they keep saying, I'm saying, I'm going to come after the media with guns.
[02:13:00.393 --> 02:13:04.017]  But they don't show in the New York Times or in the Washington Post where I said it.
[02:13:04.037 --> 02:13:05.438]  In fact, document cam, shot, please.
[02:13:06.859 --> 02:13:10.803]  New York Times, Media Matters lie, claim Alex Jones intended violence against the press.
[02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:23.240]  It says on Periscope, Alex Jones, that's Twitter, tells supporters to get their, notice that's not a quote, there's no quote around Alex Jones tells supporters, it's battle rifles, that's in quotes, ready against antifa.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:24.061]  It doesn't say that.
[02:13:24.401 --> 02:13:25.002]  I didn't say that.
[02:13:25.682 --> 02:13:27.364]  I just said battle rifles in there for your home.
[02:13:28.725 --> 02:13:33.570]  So they just say, in 8th grade you would fail an English test for doing this.
[02:13:34.811 --> 02:13:35.632]  See, this is fraud.
[02:13:35.692 --> 02:13:36.993]  They think you don't understand it.
[02:13:38.746 --> 02:13:43.510]  On Periscope, Alex Jones tells supporters to get their, quote, battle rifles then ready against the anti-foot.
[02:13:43.570 --> 02:13:44.410]  No quote, didn't say that.
[02:13:44.911 --> 02:13:46.812]  The mainstream media, no quote, didn't say that.
[02:13:48.614 --> 02:13:50.175]  And the, quote, Chi-Com operatives.
[02:13:51.776 --> 02:13:57.320]  We're talking about Apple and Google moving there officially and showing people a mainstream news article.
[02:13:57.901 --> 02:14:00.563]  So that's not get your battle rifles ready for the Chi-Coms.
[02:14:00.823 --> 02:14:01.804]  That just sounds crazy.
[02:14:02.762 --> 02:14:03.062]  No list.
[02:14:03.222 --> 02:14:03.703]  No video.
[02:14:04.203 --> 02:14:04.863]  The New York Times.
[02:14:05.924 --> 02:14:10.066]  The worst though was Market Watch, owned by the Wall Street Journal.
[02:14:10.466 --> 02:14:25.135]  They went further to say a BuzzFeed reporter tweeted, well they said it must be true, Tuesday night the tweet that got Jones in trouble with Twitter linked to a video periscope which Twitter owns while Jones apparently took down the tweet.
[02:14:26.084 --> 02:14:27.145]  Well, that's because they ordered us to.
[02:14:27.205 --> 02:14:27.805]  I just said, okay.
[02:14:28.105 --> 02:14:34.109]  Media Matters preserved the video, like I was trying to hide it, in which Jones calls on followers to prepare for violence.
[02:14:34.269 --> 02:14:35.190]  There's no quotes on that.
[02:14:35.530 --> 02:14:36.951]  Jones tells followers to prepare for violence.
[02:14:36.991 --> 02:14:37.652]  No quote on that.
[02:14:37.692 --> 02:14:38.372]  That's called fraud.
[02:14:38.812 --> 02:14:42.735]  In the video, Jones urges supporters, no quotes, to get battle rifles.
[02:14:42.835 --> 02:14:44.556]  See how the Media Matters writes the live script?
[02:14:44.576 --> 02:14:45.076]  They all repeat it.
[02:14:45.397 --> 02:14:47.138]  Battle rifles, ready to fight.
[02:14:47.178 --> 02:14:47.818]  There's no quote there.
[02:14:48.599 --> 02:14:49.159]  There's no quote.
[02:14:49.859 --> 02:14:50.420]  There's no quote.
[02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:55.322]  Antifa is a one-word quote, because in a 20-minute deal, I said Antifa.
[02:14:55.742 --> 02:14:57.923]  The mainstream media and Chai Com operatives.
[02:14:58.163 --> 02:14:58.523]  Same deal.
[02:14:58.563 --> 02:14:59.564]  Quote on Chai Com operatives.
[02:15:01.805 --> 02:15:02.826]  Now, you see how that works?
[02:15:04.406 --> 02:15:04.987]  Here's another one.
[02:15:05.027 --> 02:15:09.289]  Here's the New York Times engaged in the unbelievable fraud, which they're the masters of.
[02:15:10.049 --> 02:15:14.692]  It says, Twitter Suspense Jones says that I violated the rules against inciting violence.
[02:15:14.952 --> 02:15:17.813]  So you hear, oh, he's inciting violence, like I'm bullying kids, but no proof.
[02:15:18.333 --> 02:15:18.834]  It just says,
[02:15:19.924 --> 02:15:26.227]  I call for supporters to get ready their quote, battle rifles, but then no quote, ready against media and others.
[02:15:27.007 --> 02:15:28.368]  The New York Times said that.
[02:15:29.568 --> 02:15:30.789]  In violation of the company's rules.
[02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:32.289]  Total fraud.
[02:15:32.329 --> 02:15:35.170]  They think we're mentally 70 IQ.
[02:15:35.871 --> 02:15:41.113]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[02:15:42.324 --> 02:15:42.664]  And why?
[02:15:42.704 --> 02:15:48.506]  Because we told you there were giant pedophile rings based in California and Pennsylvania and it was all about to come out and now it is.
[02:15:48.926 --> 02:15:55.228]  Hundreds and hundreds of arrests, hundreds of indictments, just the last day, mass roundups, and it's all coming out.
[02:15:55.308 --> 02:15:58.490]  And they are scared that you're going to find out they're scared because they work for them.
[02:16:03.143 --> 02:16:08.767]  Together we're going to restore safety to our streets and peace to our communities.
[02:16:09.268 --> 02:16:15.572]  And we're going to destroy the vile criminal cartel MS-13 and many other gangs.
[02:16:16.753 --> 02:16:19.775]  But MS-13 is particularly violent.
[02:16:20.516 --> 02:16:23.078]  They don't like shooting people because it's too quick.
[02:16:23.818 --> 02:16:24.699]  It's too fast.
[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:31.124]  I was reading one of these animals was caught and explaining they like to knife them and cut them.
[02:16:32.133 --> 02:16:37.579]  And let him die slowly because that way it's more painful and they enjoy watching that much more.
[02:16:37.639 --> 02:16:38.380]  These are animals.
[02:16:38.661 --> 02:16:40.563]  Did you hear him call MS-13 animals?
[02:16:40.663 --> 02:16:41.344]  Yes, I did.
[02:16:41.364 --> 02:16:42.225]  What do you think about that?
[02:16:42.505 --> 02:16:43.346]  I think he's a pig.
[02:16:43.366 --> 02:16:44.948]  An animal.
[02:16:44.988 --> 02:16:46.469]  I mean, you know, you smell your own, I guess.
[02:16:46.489 --> 02:16:48.512]  Maybe not all people in that group are animals.
[02:16:48.832 --> 02:16:49.973]  No, they're not animals at all.
[02:16:50.013 --> 02:16:51.374]  They're human beings just like all of us.
[02:16:51.694 --> 02:16:52.574]  I think he's a pig.
[02:16:52.854 --> 02:16:58.438]  He's just using that as an excuse to, I don't know, justify his being such a racist.
[02:16:58.518 --> 02:17:01.520]  And then this week Trump made the comment about MS-13 being animals.
[02:17:01.540 --> 02:17:02.160]  Did you hear about that?
[02:17:02.180 --> 02:17:02.841]  I did.
[02:17:02.861 --> 02:17:03.861]  What do you think about that?
[02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:07.804]  I think he's criticizing his own American people.
[02:17:07.924 --> 02:17:09.184]  What can you say about this guy?
[02:17:09.244 --> 02:17:09.885]  He's the animal.
[02:17:10.748 --> 02:17:13.010]  Would you agree that not all MS13 members are animals?
[02:17:13.290 --> 02:17:13.811]  Absolutely.
[02:17:13.831 --> 02:17:14.492]  Cool.
[02:17:14.512 --> 02:17:15.913]  And then, um, it kind of, yeah, exactly.
[02:17:15.933 --> 02:17:18.575]  It's just like a negative, always negative in the news, always negative in the news.
[02:17:18.595 --> 02:17:21.758]  The guys that are running around gangbanging, killing people, they're animals.
[02:17:22.319 --> 02:17:22.559]  You know?
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:25.662]  But the rest of the gang, it's a big gang, you know?
[02:17:26.002 --> 02:17:29.586]  I can't decide whether I should laugh at this or it's like a punch to my gut.
[02:17:30.946 --> 02:17:32.346]  Yeah, I feel the same way.
[02:17:32.566 --> 02:17:36.047]  And I feel like it's a punch to the gut a lot of times.
[02:17:36.307 --> 02:17:44.069]  And people with that last video, a lot of them say, oh, you probably interviewed a ton of people and picked the five people that actually supported MS-13.
[02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:48.490]  And Owen, I swear to you, those are the five people I interviewed.
[02:17:48.770 --> 02:17:50.030]  Those were the five reactions.
[02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:51.151]  I went five for five.
[02:17:51.351 --> 02:17:54.271]  Every single person I asked, MS-13, are they animals?
[02:17:54.831 --> 02:17:57.032]  Every single person I asked in West Hollywood said no.
[02:17:57.732 --> 02:17:58.632]  So it's scary.
[02:17:58.692 --> 02:18:08.395]  We're in a really weird spot right now where the left, just to spite Trump, is doubling down on things that are in no way at all American or American values.
[02:18:08.455 --> 02:18:17.897]  And I think one of the only reasons the left is able to get away with these ridiculous stories, these ridiculous claims, is because their base audience has such a short attention span.
[02:18:18.517 --> 02:18:22.043]  So they basically engineered, like, the perfect resistor in a way.
[02:18:22.063 --> 02:18:33.861]  It's people with short attention spans, people that don't actually pay attention to politics, a lot of times they think they're educated because they went to college and are in debt, and for that reason they feel like they're oppressed and they know more than everybody.
[02:18:34.501 --> 02:18:38.103]  And a lot of what we're seeing now, I think, is going beyond politics.
[02:18:38.163 --> 02:18:40.685]  I think it's basically coming down to good versus evil.
[02:18:41.005 --> 02:18:44.407]  And I think it's coming down to establishment versus anti-establishment.
[02:18:44.807 --> 02:18:56.054]  And it's scary to see the left head in this direction because not too long ago, liberals were the ones who were for free speech, who were against censorship, who wanted to expose government corruption.
[02:18:56.414 --> 02:18:58.616]  And now we're seeing them side with things that
[02:18:59.276 --> 02:19:04.837]  I don't think anyone should ever side with, and it's just at a base level, anti, you know, un-American, anti-American.
[02:19:04.897 --> 02:19:24.561]  But I think the good news is, every time the left takes a stand and supports MS-13, or, you know, promotes the Me Too movement, meanwhile they're all sexual predators in Hollywood, and every time they take a stand and contradict themselves, I think their audience shrinks just a little bit, and it's the people in the middle, the rational people, the centrists,
[02:19:25.061 --> 02:19:32.286]  The independents, the maybe even classical liberals, who are now looking around and saying, wait, why is my party defending MS-13?
[02:19:32.306 --> 02:19:35.828]  Why are we pretending that Hollywood isn't a toxic culture?
[02:19:36.188 --> 02:19:40.390]  And these are the people that are going to start heading to the right, just like we're seeing, you know, across the board.
[02:19:40.831 --> 02:19:49.336]  So while the far left will always be the far left and the protesters will always be pretty much brainwashed and convinced that Trump is the devil himself,
[02:19:49.896 --> 02:19:56.440]  Everyone else in the middle who is somewhat rational will start waking up and their audience I think is shrinking by the day for that reason.
[02:20:03.444 --> 02:20:06.086]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.983 --> 02:20:25.167]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:25.628 --> 02:20:27.051]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.008 --> 02:20:32.670]  Okay, ahead of the midterms, they have gone to complete deception mode.
[02:20:33.870 --> 02:20:36.471]  And notice, there's no congressional hearings having me speak.
[02:20:36.531 --> 02:20:38.712]  Lester Holt isn't having me on to hear what I have to say.
[02:20:39.553 --> 02:20:41.654]  Jack Dorsey was just on with Lester Holt.
[02:20:42.014 --> 02:20:43.594]  It's thetopofdrugreport.com.
[02:20:43.614 --> 02:20:45.155]  We'll put that on screen for you right now.
[02:20:45.956 --> 02:20:49.597]  Tech CEO Jack Dorsey on Alex Jones, election security and regrets.
[02:20:50.377 --> 02:20:53.439]  And then it's all about, he keeps saying nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[02:20:53.519 --> 02:20:54.719]  Well, I'm sad he does that.
[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:55.920]  Not saying that.
[02:20:57.441 --> 02:21:01.565]  So it's always a way to just put me back through the ringer over and over again.
[02:21:01.605 --> 02:21:15.558]  Meanwhile, they've banned me, blocked me on Twitter for seven days because the Southern Harvey Law Center and the Media Matters people put out a headline saying I said I'm gonna use battle rifles on the media.
[02:21:15.638 --> 02:21:16.499]  It's not true!
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:18.041]  It's all a lie!
[02:21:18.841 --> 02:21:22.325]  But Dorsey says he hopes I quit my behavior before he bans me.
[02:21:23.735 --> 02:21:27.337]  So then when they ban me, it's like, well, see, we did, and then they're going to ban you too.
[02:21:27.698 --> 02:21:29.499]  I love how it's all a big re-education camp.
[02:21:30.539 --> 02:21:36.183]  It's all a big, giant re-education camp where they just tell me I did all the stuff I didn't do.
[02:21:36.203 --> 02:21:37.764]  They never show what I supposedly did.
[02:21:38.285 --> 02:21:40.786]  And the clip Media Matters shows, I never say what they said I did.
[02:21:41.206 --> 02:21:43.008]  Notice there's just quotes on single words there.
[02:21:47.050 --> 02:21:49.992]  But all the other media that carried didn't even show the clip.
[02:21:50.473 --> 02:21:52.274]  You watch the clip, and it's like, I didn't say that.
[02:21:53.504 --> 02:21:55.185]  Again, if I did, it wouldn't be an issue.
[02:21:58.186 --> 02:21:58.887]  It's the First Amendment.
[02:21:58.927 --> 02:22:00.368]  I didn't say use weapons on the media.
[02:22:00.388 --> 02:22:01.808]  I don't want them to have weapons used on them.
[02:22:01.948 --> 02:22:02.889]  That'll make them victims.
[02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:05.550]  I'm worried they're going to false flag and stage something on themselves.
[02:22:05.570 --> 02:22:09.752]  And then they're going to send antifa out to all our houses, which they're doxing everybody, saying they are.
[02:22:09.992 --> 02:22:12.274]  And I said defensively, be prepared to defend yourself.
[02:22:12.554 --> 02:22:14.855]  And they say that is inciting violence.
[02:22:14.895 --> 02:22:15.315]  No, it's not.
[02:22:16.136 --> 02:22:18.877]  Saying the antifa can be as violent as they want, that's inciting it.
[02:22:19.177 --> 02:22:20.558]  We're having trouble with Tosh Plumlee's phone.
[02:22:20.578 --> 02:22:22.179]  It was working great earlier.
[02:22:23.274 --> 02:22:25.957]  He's had folks breaking in on it, blocking it, threatening him.
[02:22:27.378 --> 02:22:28.740]  They're scared of what he's about to talk about.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:30.041]  It's not declassified stuff.
[02:22:30.101 --> 02:22:30.902]  It's about the threats.
[02:22:32.123 --> 02:22:33.144]  Famous CIA whistleblower.
[02:22:33.164 --> 02:22:35.286]  That's why they don't want us on air, because big stuff's coming.
[02:22:35.727 --> 02:22:36.227]  But here it is.
[02:22:36.267 --> 02:22:37.088]  Top story on Drudge.
[02:22:37.128 --> 02:22:38.410]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[02:22:38.810 --> 02:22:40.932]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Alex Jones.
[02:22:41.333 --> 02:22:42.874]  Election security and regrets.
[02:22:42.914 --> 02:22:43.235]  Here it is.
[02:22:44.821 --> 02:22:58.091]  Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people to get their battle rifles ready against the media, saying it's time to act, it's got to be done now, move criminally against people.
[02:22:58.351 --> 02:22:58.851]  Hit pause!
[02:23:00.112 --> 02:23:03.455]  You're seeing total fraud by Lester Holt that rigged debates for Hillary.
[02:23:05.469 --> 02:23:10.913]  They're literally taking a 20-minute clip, like the refrigerator magnet word game.
[02:23:11.714 --> 02:23:15.617]  I mean, I could take what Lester Holt just said and turn around and say, Lester Holt said that.
[02:23:15.677 --> 02:23:20.561]  This is total fraud that you're seeing right now.
[02:23:20.961 --> 02:23:21.922]  This is all scripted out.
[02:23:21.962 --> 02:23:22.322]  Keep going.
[02:23:22.763 --> 02:23:23.984]  It sent a chill up my spine.
[02:23:24.004 --> 02:23:24.504]  How about yours?
[02:23:24.524 --> 02:23:25.745]  It did.
[02:23:25.785 --> 02:23:30.489]  I mean, there's a number of actions that we believe... Start it over again!
[02:23:30.509 --> 02:23:33.091]  I mean, I gotta hear that for myself, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:35.086 --> 02:23:43.172]  And again, if you just joined us, overhead shot please, let me show you what they did in MarketWatch and everywhere else.
[02:23:43.332 --> 02:23:44.773]  I'm going to show it again.
[02:23:44.833 --> 02:23:45.034]  Look.
[02:23:45.914 --> 02:23:48.916]  Twitter temporarily blocks Alex Jones from tweeting, says I'm inciting violence.
[02:23:49.717 --> 02:23:56.742]  Then it says, in the video, Jones urges his supporters to get, quote, battle rifles, stop quote, ready to fight.
[02:23:56.802 --> 02:23:57.603]  Didn't say ready to fight.
[02:23:58.184 --> 02:24:02.447]  Later, Antifa, the mainstream media, no quotes, and Chicom operatives.
[02:24:03.715 --> 02:24:09.298]  I said the CHICOM operatives have Google and Facebook and Apple under their control.
[02:24:09.598 --> 02:24:11.840]  I say Antifa is calling for violence to come to our homes.
[02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:13.300]  We need to stop this.
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:14.121]  Trump needs to stop it.
[02:24:14.661 --> 02:24:16.382]  Calls on his followers to prepare for violence.
[02:24:16.742 --> 02:24:17.443]  That's not a quote.
[02:24:20.124 --> 02:24:24.127]  I said a lot of congressmen and people who have already been attacked should have their battle rifles by their beds.
[02:24:24.929 --> 02:24:34.632]  You're seeing... I guess they decided, maybe, when they banned me off all the deplatforming, let's legitimize why we do it with Twitter for a week or two and then take him through.
[02:24:35.292 --> 02:24:36.353]  And now I'm starting to see.
[02:24:36.533 --> 02:24:38.393]  So this is all elaborately scripted, folks.
[02:24:38.793 --> 02:24:40.574]  Totally elaborately scripted.
[02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:44.041]  I'm going to do a little game.
[02:24:44.061 --> 02:24:55.934]  I'm going to do a video where I take a Market Watch article that has the author's name and then I can just cut it out and then have them say the most outlaid... I could take the New Testament and have Jesus say, I love Satan.
[02:24:58.427 --> 02:24:59.987]  Why have thou forsaken me, Lucifer?
[02:25:00.708 --> 02:25:03.868]  He didn't say that, but I could take the words, cut them out, and then put them back together.
[02:25:03.928 --> 02:25:08.309]  You wouldn't get a F for false quotes in an 8th grade English class, man.
[02:25:08.349 --> 02:25:09.710]  This is fraud!
[02:25:10.310 --> 02:25:11.070]  Continue, here it is.
[02:25:12.010 --> 02:25:25.554]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people to get their battle rifles ready against the media, saying it's time to act, it's gotta be done now, move criminally against people.
[02:25:26.554 --> 02:25:27.815]  Send a chill up my spine.
[02:25:27.855 --> 02:25:28.355]  How about yours?
[02:25:29.256 --> 02:25:29.556]  It did.
[02:25:29.616 --> 02:25:30.877]  I mean, there's a number.
[02:25:31.217 --> 02:25:31.977]  That's a real quote.
[02:25:32.258 --> 02:25:36.060]  We need to move legislatively, executively through the criminal justice system.
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:39.002]  That turns into move criminally.
[02:25:39.122 --> 02:25:40.262]  Oh, let's be criminals.
[02:25:40.382 --> 02:25:41.163]  I didn't say that.
[02:25:42.724 --> 02:25:44.085]  God, these people think you're stupid.
[02:25:44.105 --> 02:25:44.645]  Let's continue.
[02:25:45.365 --> 02:25:47.467]  Actions that we believe
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:59.666]  Help a call to incitement to violence and those are the things that we need to Make sure that we're taking action on you have you've taken action against him in this instance What is it?
[02:25:59.867 --> 02:26:00.747]  Can you tell us what it is?
[02:26:01.127 --> 02:26:10.312]  We I believe we put him in a timeout Removing his ability to tweet for for a time period a timeout seems
[02:26:12.461 --> 02:26:19.487]  Seems minor compared to the implications of someone suggesting a call to arms against a particular group, in this case, the media.
[02:26:19.948 --> 02:26:20.548]  Pause again.
[02:26:20.909 --> 02:26:24.752]  They have a hundred newspapers publishing right now that Trump wants violence against the media.
[02:26:24.772 --> 02:26:26.354]  And I'm saying I think they're going to stage something.
[02:26:26.634 --> 02:26:27.715]  The last thing we want is that.
[02:26:27.735 --> 02:26:33.320]  And they want me silenced to say, as I predicted weeks ago, that I'm the cause of the violence.
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:34.961]  And Mike Adams predicted this as well.
[02:26:35.041 --> 02:26:37.584]  This is unbelievable.
[02:26:39.952 --> 02:26:52.736]  I said peacefully, politically, to the criminal justice system, we have to stop Antifa, doxing police officers and others and calling for their deaths, and calling to kill Republican members of Congress, like Congressman Scalise, and that members of Congress that have been targeted should be protecting themselves.
[02:26:54.377 --> 02:26:55.717]  I like to play the video for you.
[02:26:57.238 --> 02:26:59.699]  Twitter said if I play it, they'll ban me completely, but I guess I already am.
[02:26:59.779 --> 02:27:02.620]  I mean, you're watching the anatomy of a hoax here.
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:05.681]  God, these people are incredible.
[02:27:05.821 --> 02:27:08.682]  Webster Holt is a galactic fraud.
[02:27:09.022 --> 02:27:09.382]  Continue.
[02:27:10.779 --> 02:27:11.621]  How do you respond to that?
[02:27:22.512 --> 02:27:25.255]  You think Alex Jones is going to change his behavior based on a timeout?
[02:27:25.455 --> 02:27:26.696]  I don't know.
[02:27:26.756 --> 02:27:32.262]  We have found that it does have the potential to change impact and change behavior.
[02:27:32.482 --> 02:27:40.289]  So whether it works within this case to change some of those behaviors and change some of those actions, I don't know.
[02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:42.512]  But this is consistent with how we enforce.
[02:27:43.052 --> 02:27:48.116]  And see, that's what it's all about in the public schools and the colleges and social networks are about conditioning you.
[02:27:48.136 --> 02:27:52.800]  They're about making you conform and go, OK, I did call for attacking the media.
[02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:53.921]  I'm sorry, I didn't.
[02:27:55.359 --> 02:27:56.920]  It's just, it's a cult, folks.
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:00.041]  So I'll be proud to be banned from Twitter, that's fine.
[02:28:00.481 --> 02:28:02.682]  These folks, some of these companies are going to have to get sued, though.
[02:28:02.702 --> 02:28:05.243]  They're going to have to get sued by you and everybody else, because they're out of control.
[02:28:05.283 --> 02:28:09.545]  But they don't care, because they think they're about to take this election through fraud, and then they're going to drop the hammer.
[02:28:09.905 --> 02:28:11.185]  And they're the ones calling for violence.
[02:28:11.606 --> 02:28:14.747]  And Lester Holt, again, is the anatomy of a con man.
[02:28:15.447 --> 02:28:16.808]  This guy is a fraud.
[02:28:17.148 --> 02:28:21.971]  I'm going to take this live feed as quickly as possible and upload it to InfoWars.com on our own servers.
[02:28:22.672 --> 02:28:26.435]  And maybe Drudge or somebody will link and say, Alex Jones' response.
[02:28:26.475 --> 02:28:31.078]  But I just showed you, I didn't say one thing like that.
[02:28:32.031 --> 02:28:43.601]  They just sit there and have the New York Times and Media Matters run by the war criminal Nazi collaborator Soros put out some fake clothes and then run with it when I said no such thing.
[02:28:43.621 --> 02:28:44.622]  You've all heard the show.
[02:28:45.063 --> 02:28:46.624]  I do not want offensive violence.
[02:28:46.644 --> 02:28:49.627]  They're the ones pushing it because we're winning politically and they know it.
[02:28:50.207 --> 02:28:53.530]  They can't stop you now from InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:55.873]  Spread those links on Twitter, YouTube, everywhere.
[02:28:56.193 --> 02:28:57.334]  Jam it out there.
[02:29:03.314 --> 02:29:08.796]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[02:29:09.036 --> 02:29:16.638]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[02:29:16.898 --> 02:29:20.059]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[02:29:20.239 --> 02:29:25.341]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[02:29:25.521 --> 02:29:28.042]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[02:29:28.282 --> 02:29:37.286]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[02:29:37.446 --> 02:29:49.055]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pau Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[02:29:49.296 --> 02:29:53.999]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:29:54.119 --> 02:29:55.781]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:29:59.821 --> 02:30:02.802]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[02:30:03.102 --> 02:30:03.602]  Go ahead.
[02:30:03.622 --> 02:30:09.204]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[02:30:09.404 --> 02:30:10.504]  I'd done the War Room.
[02:30:10.784 --> 02:30:13.265]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[02:30:13.285 --> 02:30:14.845]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[02:30:14.885 --> 02:30:15.506]  I was exhausted.
[02:30:15.826 --> 02:30:19.087]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[02:30:19.427 --> 02:30:24.068]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:26.189]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[02:30:26.209 --> 02:30:26.849]  The same thing.
[02:30:26.889 --> 02:30:28.990]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:30.311]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[02:30:30.491 --> 02:30:32.573]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[02:30:32.613 --> 02:30:38.597]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[02:30:38.897 --> 02:30:39.758]  You can sleep with it.
[02:30:40.018 --> 02:30:44.361]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[02:30:44.421 --> 02:30:47.203]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[02:30:47.363 --> 02:30:49.064]  This is the best combination I have found.
[02:30:49.084 --> 02:30:49.884]  It really works.
[02:30:50.104 --> 02:30:54.688]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[02:30:55.068 --> 02:30:56.709]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods.
[02:30:56.889 --> 02:30:57.250]  Believe me.
[02:31:00.959 --> 02:31:02.683]  What are champions made of?
[02:31:04.387 --> 02:31:05.530]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:31:12.088 --> 02:31:14.329]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline!

[02:31:59.768 --> 02:32:04.352]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:32:04.372 --> 02:32:04.872]  Thanks for holding.
[02:32:04.932 --> 02:32:05.853]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:32:06.273 --> 02:32:09.896]  I've been following you since I was 14, and I'm 32 now.
[02:32:09.976 --> 02:32:18.223]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen, and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet now.
[02:32:18.243 --> 02:32:18.723]  I thought it was
[02:32:18.843 --> 02:32:35.002]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:32:35.502 --> 02:32:44.029]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:32:44.109 --> 02:32:48.872]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:54.257]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:33:03.030 --> 02:33:05.613]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:15.703 --> 02:33:17.584]  Tosh Plumlee's gonna have to get to a landline.
[02:33:17.624 --> 02:33:19.945]  They are literally jamming his phone and cutting in on it right now.
[02:33:20.445 --> 02:33:21.846]  It's a famous J.A.
[02:33:21.906 --> 02:33:23.046]  whistleblower contractor.
[02:33:23.767 --> 02:33:27.888]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:33:28.629 --> 02:33:30.149]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:30.810 --> 02:33:32.771]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:33.111 --> 02:33:37.553]  Broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[02:33:37.693 --> 02:33:42.335]  I'm gonna upload it to our own servers, the last segment you saw.
[02:33:43.419 --> 02:33:56.302]  I'm gonna post it to InfoWars.com and the article Paul Watson wrote about it and I'm just begging Drudge after a full week of pure coverage, not that he hasn't done us so many favors already, to link to it so that I have a chance to respond to Lester Holt, man.
[02:33:57.543 --> 02:34:00.163]  And again, it's the truth being murdered that gets me upset.
[02:34:00.183 --> 02:34:04.224]  It's that I did a 20-minute live video.
[02:34:05.945 --> 02:34:06.865]  This was Monday night.
[02:34:10.896 --> 02:34:16.539]  And it had a headline about how the president's wrong to not be taking action against internet censorship.
[02:34:17.279 --> 02:34:23.802]  And in it I talk about Antifa and Rob Reiner calling for violence and civil unrest and overthrows and all the violence against conservatives.
[02:34:23.842 --> 02:34:30.905]  And I said we have to legislatively, judicially, criminally, through the criminal justice system,
[02:34:32.356 --> 02:34:50.101]  Stand up against this and this is a clear and present danger and I said they're threatening all these Congress people and already shooting them and already attacking them and already saying and doxing their addresses and Saying go to their houses and you know saying harass them and I said people need to have their battle rifle by their bed If they get attacked that's totally defensive.
[02:34:50.121 --> 02:35:00.224]  That's Americana Paul Ryan's this man threatened to axe attack him and his family So then
[02:35:01.331 --> 02:35:07.774]  They go, you are restricted, because CNN reported it, and Media Matters says you're calling for violence.
[02:35:08.334 --> 02:35:09.195]  Clearly you don't.
[02:35:10.275 --> 02:35:12.216]  In the New York Times, nowhere do they show the video.
[02:35:12.276 --> 02:35:14.437]  Media Matters does, and clearly it's... I'm not saying that.
[02:35:15.138 --> 02:35:19.080]  And Lester Holt says, Jones wants people to criminally take criminal action.
[02:35:21.621 --> 02:35:27.504]  I don't know who's going to get sued in all this, because I'm busy fighting the Globals, getting the word out, but I think by not suing a bunch of people,
[02:35:29.775 --> 02:35:31.816]  And I've already said prepare the suits, we've just been busy.
[02:35:33.017 --> 02:35:45.766]  I have to sue Lester Holt, because they're trying to get me deplatformed, and then they're lying about me to do it to shut me up.
[02:35:45.846 --> 02:35:49.988]  I mean, it's classic malice of forethought, intent to do harm.
[02:35:50.008 --> 02:35:52.370]  I'm gonna call my lawyers right now.
[02:35:52.430 --> 02:35:53.571]  I mean, I've been telling them to get on it.
[02:35:53.591 --> 02:35:55.472]  We're just gonna have to sue these people.
[02:35:57.952 --> 02:36:02.374]  The New York Times takes one word quotes and then puts them all together to make an imaginary sentence up.
[02:36:03.315 --> 02:36:07.597]  And then Holt goes, oh, he's essentially saying they know full damn well what they're doing.
[02:36:08.418 --> 02:36:11.079]  Show them the clip, you lying garbage.
[02:36:11.939 --> 02:36:12.980]  You are the enemy.
[02:36:13.260 --> 02:36:16.982]  We have CNN saying I'm a domestic terrorist and need to be arrested.
[02:36:21.364 --> 02:36:23.866]  Doesn't everybody see what a clear and present danger this is right now?
[02:36:27.628 --> 02:36:29.190]  And you can see Dorsey tip his hand.
[02:36:29.750 --> 02:36:32.914]  Well, we'll see if... We hate banning people.
[02:36:34.015 --> 02:36:36.978]  When we put them in timeout like they're little babies that shouldn't drink their fluoride.
[02:36:36.998 --> 02:36:39.020]  And didn't take their vaccines.
[02:36:40.382 --> 02:36:45.187]  We're gonna have to... You know, and maybe fully ban him.
[02:36:45.247 --> 02:36:46.428]  That'll teach him.
[02:36:47.349 --> 02:36:49.492]  That'll teach me that you guys all lied about me?
[02:36:51.069 --> 02:36:58.872]  And then got up there like you always do and grandstand how you're the good mainstream media when the mainstream media and NBC are famous for covering up for the pedophile rings.
[02:36:59.173 --> 02:36:59.893]  But here's the good news.
[02:36:59.933 --> 02:37:01.694]  Your pedophile rings are all getting exposed.
[02:37:03.654 --> 02:37:06.836]  And your Lolita Express and all your globalism and all your crap.
[02:37:07.856 --> 02:37:09.417]  And so, just whatever.
[02:37:09.457 --> 02:37:11.378]  But watching the process of them
[02:37:12.898 --> 02:37:14.939]  Destroy the truth and murder the truth.
[02:37:15.419 --> 02:37:17.500]  And yeah, it's great to have our app go from number 4 to number 1.
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:19.600]  It's great to have millions sign up for the free podcast.
[02:37:20.201 --> 02:37:21.901]  The point is, is that that's for Infowars.
[02:37:22.201 --> 02:37:25.022]  They're destroying, they're banning everybody right now.
[02:37:25.443 --> 02:37:26.643]  And it's outrageous.
[02:37:26.723 --> 02:37:29.704]  And again, Trump is doing nothing.
[02:37:31.785 --> 02:37:33.525]  Other than saying, hey, shadow banning.
[02:37:33.826 --> 02:37:34.986]  Very illegal, better stop that.
[02:37:35.226 --> 02:37:37.567]  So Dorsey's acting like he's not doing that right now.
[02:37:40.711 --> 02:37:44.133]  And then it's this whole thing of, Dorsey, why aren't you doing anything to Alex Jones?
[02:37:45.373 --> 02:37:50.376]  And the whole litany of lies, the whole litany of things I didn't do out of context, never a clip, never any proof.
[02:37:50.416 --> 02:37:51.396]  It's like a 10-minute interview.
[02:37:57.099 --> 02:38:05.023]  I mean, to watch them hype up violence in this country and promote anti-feminist media, and then point their fingers at us,
[02:38:06.471 --> 02:38:13.098]  And say we're hyping the violence, show when the violence comes to the media, we know it's coming, they're hyping it like it's going to happen.
[02:38:13.119 --> 02:38:20.287]  Well, you know, we have to take over and have to ban free speech because people are going to be mean to the mainstream media, and Jones is saying come after the media with violence.
[02:38:21.788 --> 02:38:23.350]  That's the last thing I want.
[02:38:25.753 --> 02:38:27.675]  And they know that.
[02:38:32.219 --> 02:38:37.704]  At least the Intercept pathway gets it, but let me guess, you know, they probably say, well, he says horrible things, like they're slave colonies.
[02:38:38.965 --> 02:38:44.769]  I never showed that this would, they're like, in papers all over the country, a comic, where I'm a green slimy monster.
[02:38:46.311 --> 02:38:49.853]  And I'm saying, they're slave colonies on Mars and I'm a space alien.
[02:38:51.335 --> 02:38:53.356]  People go, boy, this is some really good fake news.
[02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:55.218]  Let me buy some boner pills from him.
[02:38:58.243 --> 02:38:59.624]  I'm not a green slimy monster.
[02:38:59.705 --> 02:39:01.326]  I don't say there's slave colonies on Mars.
[02:39:03.088 --> 02:39:06.412]  It's just... It's an orgy of lying.
[02:39:06.432 --> 02:39:16.322]  They're like, well, America got away from us, social media turned against us, so we're just going to hit everything with lies the world has never seen before.
[02:39:21.895 --> 02:39:22.996]  And I mean, that's it.
[02:39:23.277 --> 02:39:24.638]  And they don't want you to have a voice.
[02:39:24.658 --> 02:39:25.859]  They don't want you to be able to communicate.
[02:39:26.099 --> 02:39:28.562]  They don't want you to be able to go to Infowars.com in the comment sections.
[02:39:28.982 --> 02:39:30.463]  They don't want you to be able to communicate.
[02:39:32.606 --> 02:39:35.448]  And it's just something to behold.
[02:39:35.468 --> 02:39:44.237]  The lockstep criminal organization of mainstream media that I actually talk about in the clip, how they put out fake news and how they repeat the fake news.
[02:39:49.512 --> 02:39:50.972]  Can you guys pull up the InfoWars Twitter?
[02:39:51.772 --> 02:39:52.633]  It's, I want to pull it up.
[02:39:53.533 --> 02:39:54.413]  It's the InfoWars Twitter.
[02:39:55.333 --> 02:39:57.414]  It's the sub Twitter, like 400,000 followers.
[02:39:57.434 --> 02:40:00.934]  And it was the one that they hadn't frozen under the rules that we were live streaming on.
[02:40:00.954 --> 02:40:03.395]  But I, scroll down, please.
[02:40:05.415 --> 02:40:07.876]  They killed that broadcast that we were on.
[02:40:09.096 --> 02:40:09.936]  Keep scrolling down, please.
[02:40:11.676 --> 02:40:12.276]  Keep scrolling down.
[02:40:14.237 --> 02:40:15.337]  Maybe it's not loading quick enough.
[02:40:18.737 --> 02:40:20.318]  Oh my god, did they kill those broadcasters?
[02:40:20.358 --> 02:40:21.078]  Is that your browser?
[02:40:22.698 --> 02:40:27.020]  Did they kill the massive pedophile bust, Sweeps the Nation?
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:29.641]  I mean, click it!
[02:40:34.002 --> 02:40:35.163]  God, that's next level, they're so...
[02:40:37.666 --> 02:40:38.387]  Wow!
[02:40:38.747 --> 02:40:39.148]  Wow!
[02:40:39.348 --> 02:40:42.912]  They didn't just block that channel.
[02:40:43.773 --> 02:40:44.574]  Keep scrolling down.
[02:40:45.334 --> 02:40:48.598]  They took down the videos.
[02:40:49.699 --> 02:40:50.400]  Wow!
[02:40:51.581 --> 02:40:53.823]  Massive Pennsylvania pedophile ring busted.
[02:40:53.843 --> 02:40:55.205]  More than 300 priests.
[02:40:55.365 --> 02:40:56.126]  Wow!
[02:40:56.746 --> 02:40:58.168]  They'll probably say that's fake news.
[02:40:58.348 --> 02:40:58.849]  Wow!
[02:41:04.582 --> 02:41:07.003]  Alex Jones did not threaten MSN with battle rifles.
[02:41:07.044 --> 02:41:08.104]  Yeah, they don't want me to respond.
[02:41:08.985 --> 02:41:10.085]  See, they left the other videos down.
[02:41:10.105 --> 02:41:10.486]  Scroll down.
[02:41:10.686 --> 02:41:13.707]  All those ones I did, last night and today, gone.
[02:41:15.408 --> 02:41:17.890]  Where I said I did not threaten people with battle rifles.
[02:41:19.051 --> 02:41:19.771]  They took me down.
[02:41:20.071 --> 02:41:24.234]  Because they're not going to let me have a voice.
[02:41:25.694 --> 02:41:27.115]  They're gonna lie about me.
[02:41:27.836 --> 02:41:29.317]  They're gonna strawman me.
[02:41:29.957 --> 02:41:31.338]  They're gonna say I'm the devil.
[02:41:33.097 --> 02:41:35.378]  But I'll say this, at least I'm not Hillary Clinton or Lester Holt.
[02:41:37.559 --> 02:41:44.183]  And we're on hundreds of TV stations and radio stations, and I'm very thankful to those stations, and you know what I really said, and you know what I really did, and you know what we stood for.
[02:41:46.124 --> 02:41:52.507]  But man, I'm telling you, if they're going to go to these links, there is no telling what they are going to do.
[02:41:53.007 --> 02:41:57.610]  But I'm going to have to reshoot all these reports and upload them to M4 so I can respond on our own servers.
[02:41:59.625 --> 02:42:12.388]  Roger Stone's coming in to get into Trump and the whole backstory with some bombshell info that is in confidence with Trump and stuff the President probably doesn't want out, but we think it's good for the truth to be out.
[02:42:12.448 --> 02:42:15.209]  So this is going to be some incredible stuff next hour they're really afraid of.
[02:42:15.269 --> 02:42:22.170]  If they're going to have more trouble stopping you grabbing these live feeds or when we archive these feeds later, we've got to get it up today.
[02:42:22.390 --> 02:42:25.811]  Not just the On Demand section, but Infowars.com with these pieces broken out.
[02:42:26.351 --> 02:42:28.672]  We're doing it at Real.Video too over at
[02:42:31.638 --> 02:42:33.620]  Mike Adams site, where you can go grab the pieces there.
[02:42:34.301 --> 02:42:36.423]  And you can put them wherever you want and get them out, but wow.
[02:42:37.363 --> 02:42:43.249]  They do not want me to sit up there and show you that I did not say, be violent with the media, which is the last thing you've all heard, I don't want that.
[02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:45.892]  My God, they're gonna frame me right now.
[02:42:47.433 --> 02:42:49.235]  They're framing me right now, wow.
[02:42:49.355 --> 02:42:50.095]  What are they planning?
[02:42:50.916 --> 02:42:52.037]  Well, pray for us, whatever.
[02:42:52.057 --> 02:42:56.762]  At least the children are being saved, the pedophile rings are being exposed, but Twitter doesn't want that out.
[02:42:59.608 --> 02:43:01.589]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:43:01.669 --> 02:43:02.030]  Go ahead.
[02:43:02.310 --> 02:43:04.511]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:43:04.531 --> 02:43:07.553]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:43:08.394 --> 02:43:09.495]  It just gets old, man.
[02:43:09.815 --> 02:43:11.536]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:43:12.236 --> 02:43:14.318]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:43:14.558 --> 02:43:18.561]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:43:18.581 --> 02:43:21.082]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:43:21.883 --> 02:43:24.224]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:43:24.564 --> 02:43:25.685]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:43:25.925 --> 02:43:26.806]  Us being shut down?
[02:43:27.046 --> 02:43:28.087]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:43:28.507 --> 02:43:29.547]  You know what, Alex?
[02:43:29.567 --> 02:43:30.667]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[02:43:30.687 --> 02:43:31.508]  Hey, Frank!
[02:43:31.768 --> 02:43:37.129]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:43:37.449 --> 02:43:41.729]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:43:41.969 --> 02:43:44.830]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:43:45.090 --> 02:43:45.470]  You understand?
[02:43:45.570 --> 02:43:46.850]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:47.210 --> 02:43:48.370]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:43:49.331 --> 02:43:54.251]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[02:43:55.192 --> 02:43:55.892]  Do you understand?
[02:43:55.912 --> 02:43:57.092]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:44:04.566 --> 02:44:05.627]  We're at Whole Paycheck.
[02:44:06.207 --> 02:44:09.328]  Or now, not at Whole Foods, but Amazon Foods.
[02:44:09.648 --> 02:44:12.250]  You know Jeff Bezos owns this now, right?
[02:44:12.270 --> 02:44:13.830]  The guy that owns Amazon, the richest guy in the world?
[02:44:14.150 --> 02:44:16.491]  It's on record that they've cut back the amount of organic food here.
[02:44:17.012 --> 02:44:18.532]  It's on record they're cutting back the quality.
[02:44:18.552 --> 02:44:19.593]  Their own employees have been blamed.
[02:44:19.713 --> 02:44:23.374]  Most of your big top billionaires have gotten the laws written where they don't pay any taxes.
[02:44:23.514 --> 02:44:24.555]  These are great products right here.
[02:44:26.414 --> 02:44:27.274]  We're coming out with one similar.
[02:44:28.095 --> 02:44:28.995]  You need magnesium.
[02:44:29.155 --> 02:44:30.256]  You need all this for your body.
[02:44:30.536 --> 02:44:32.677]  They say it's a scam, and I sell it, but not Jeff Bezos.
[02:44:33.077 --> 02:44:38.840]  So, this is the most consumerist thing in the world by a monopoly man who's buying up the whole country.
[02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:39.700]  Made $12 billion in one day.
[02:44:42.061 --> 02:44:43.162]  12 billion himself.
[02:44:44.143 --> 02:44:45.904]  12 b-b-b-b-billion.
[02:44:45.924 --> 02:44:47.465]  This is Bezos' private property.
[02:44:47.925 --> 02:44:48.926]  He doesn't respect ours.
[02:44:48.946 --> 02:44:50.687]  He lobbies to end small family homes.
[02:44:51.147 --> 02:44:53.729]  He wants 250 square foot coffin apartments.
[02:44:54.029 --> 02:44:55.310]  USDA called for that last week.
[02:44:55.490 --> 02:44:58.512]  He doesn't want you to have any money, but he made 12 billion dollars in one day last week.
[02:44:58.672 --> 02:45:00.233]  But I agree with his property rights.
[02:45:00.373 --> 02:45:02.415]  And I agree with this security officer's point.
[02:45:02.715 --> 02:45:03.535]  This is private property.
[02:45:03.916 --> 02:45:04.936]  And they've asked us to stop filming.
[02:45:04.956 --> 02:45:07.738]  So what we're going to do is, we're going to go wait outside on the property line.
[02:45:07.898 --> 02:45:08.519]  Last morning,
[02:45:09.219 --> 02:45:10.820]  You know, you're in private property.
[02:45:10.900 --> 02:45:13.142]  Whole Foods doesn't want you on the property.
[02:45:13.282 --> 02:45:14.762]  You can go around the parking lot.
[02:45:14.802 --> 02:45:17.924]  So, if you want to go to the sidewalk right now before you call AT&T.
[02:45:18.485 --> 02:45:18.865]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:45:18.905 --> 02:45:21.927]  Because you're not following our instructions or the Oak Ridge instructions.
[02:45:21.947 --> 02:45:23.508]  So, if you can go to the sidewalk.
[02:45:23.848 --> 02:45:24.328]  That's all.
[02:45:24.408 --> 02:45:25.389]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:45:25.449 --> 02:45:26.609]  I'm trying to be courteous.
[02:45:26.669 --> 02:45:29.231]  I'm trying to be courteous and nice to you.
[02:45:29.251 --> 02:45:29.951]  You're not complying.
[02:45:29.971 --> 02:45:30.752]  I'm being really nice to you.
[02:45:30.772 --> 02:45:32.213]  I need you to go to the other side.
[02:45:32.253 --> 02:45:32.913]  Well, sure, I will.
[02:45:32.953 --> 02:45:33.854]  But I can't get my car.
[02:45:33.914 --> 02:45:35.295]  Maybe I can go to the sidewalk, please.
[02:45:37.105 --> 02:45:38.732]  Try it nice, like you do too, big man.
[02:45:38.953 --> 02:45:39.414]  Big tough guy.
[02:45:43.028 --> 02:45:50.429]  Jeff Bezos made $12 million in one day last week, ripping you off by owning Whole Foods and lowering the quality.
[02:45:50.489 --> 02:45:56.690]  Jeff Bezos makes $1.50 on every single package he ships out on Amazon to the US Postal Service.
[02:45:56.770 --> 02:46:01.911]  Jeff Bezos is a criminal who is anti-free-market and anti-America.
[02:46:02.151 --> 02:46:08.172]  And we came out here nicely to cover it, and he had one of his goons get in our face.
[02:46:08.212 --> 02:46:11.453]  So, the little cheetahs in there that think it's funny,
[02:46:12.813 --> 02:46:13.974]  Look at this!
[02:46:13.994 --> 02:46:15.115]  Look at this trending!
[02:46:15.835 --> 02:46:17.416]  Jeff Bezos is your enemy!
[02:46:17.596 --> 02:46:18.716]  Bezos thinks you're schmucks.
[02:46:19.417 --> 02:46:22.098]  He made $12 billion in one day, last week.
[02:46:22.638 --> 02:46:23.999]  Richest guy in the world.
[02:46:24.539 --> 02:46:26.540]  And that jerk, they know my car's parts in there.
[02:46:26.581 --> 02:46:28.401]  I said, yeah, we're gonna stop and go home and get my car.
[02:46:28.421 --> 02:46:29.222]  He said, get off the property.
[02:46:30.179 --> 02:46:31.400]  So see how that works in America?
[02:46:31.720 --> 02:46:34.922]  It's like 18 of my products are private-labeled national brands that they're private-labeled to.
[02:46:34.942 --> 02:46:42.007]  We had to come in here and just get in Bezos' face, because the leftists in here even told me when I had three kids, I got four now, hey, you got too many kids.
[02:46:42.087 --> 02:46:42.807]  That's the cult.
[02:46:43.087 --> 02:46:49.231]  They got magazines that say sustainable development, you know, being poor is the new chic, austerity is cool.
[02:46:50.192 --> 02:46:51.273]  Bezos isn't austere.
[02:47:04.016 --> 02:47:06.625]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.159 --> 02:47:31.645]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:47:32.646 --> 02:47:36.549]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:47:36.990 --> 02:47:40.813]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:47:41.193 --> 02:47:42.834]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:43.955 --> 02:47:51.682]  So, I shoot videos saying I did not call for violence against the media and showing that I didn't say it, and Twitter deletes the videos.
[02:47:53.172 --> 02:47:58.233]  So that the fraud that's been put out can be built and he can do interviews with Lester Holt and all the rest of it.
[02:47:58.714 --> 02:48:01.294]  Meanwhile, here's our article from last week, August 7th.
[02:48:01.814 --> 02:48:05.255]  MSM fueling Nazi-style censorship to trigger violence.
[02:48:05.656 --> 02:48:06.516]  Don't take the bait.
[02:48:07.376 --> 02:48:13.318]  Official InfoWars article that I wrote with Kit Daniels, calling for no one to be violent against the mainstream media, that they're going to lie about it.
[02:48:14.298 --> 02:48:18.819]  I've got Reuters calling me, saying, oh, what do you want to hear about your call for violence?
[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:21.040]  I'll call them.
[02:48:21.120 --> 02:48:21.660]  I'll record it.
[02:48:23.584 --> 02:48:27.146]  So you can see when it comes out and they don't quote me, or maybe they will.
[02:48:27.226 --> 02:48:28.986]  I've actually seen one fair article out of Reuters.
[02:48:29.346 --> 02:48:30.867]  I wonder if that guy got fired last week.
[02:48:32.268 --> 02:48:36.750]  This has reached total insanity land, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:36.790 --> 02:48:37.550]  This has reached
[02:48:39.465 --> 02:48:48.317]  Where they take completely obvious video, take single words out of it, put them together in articles, and everyone knows I didn't say it, and then Lester Holt goes with it.
[02:48:48.757 --> 02:48:49.458]  I'm chilled.
[02:48:49.538 --> 02:48:50.660]  I'm scared right now.
[02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:52.322]  Alex wants to hurt me.
[02:48:54.224 --> 02:48:55.326]  Which means they're gonna hurt me.
[02:49:01.385 --> 02:49:02.006]  It's amazing.
[02:49:02.186 --> 02:49:04.428]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to this.
[02:49:04.448 --> 02:49:05.529]  This is some big breaking news.
[02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:11.094]  Trump revoked security clearance of John Brennan, the admitted communist and Mojave's former CIA director.
[02:49:11.995 --> 02:49:15.459]  President Trump today revoked the security clearance of John O. Brennan.
[02:49:15.519 --> 02:49:16.119]  He's out of government.
[02:49:16.139 --> 02:49:16.660]  He shouldn't have it.
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:20.924]  The former CIA director under President Barack Obama, who ran the illegal spying, all of it.
[02:49:23.303 --> 02:49:25.205]  ...what he called Mr. Brennan's erratic behavior.
[02:49:25.465 --> 02:49:35.412]  The White House has threatened last month to strip Mr. Brennan and two other Obama administration officials, Susan E. Rice, who ran the illegal spying, and the former National Security Advisor and James R. Clapper, who famously lied to Congress.
[02:49:36.793 --> 02:49:37.994]  And it goes on from there.
[02:49:38.074 --> 02:49:41.556]  So, that's good news, the president politically punching back.
[02:49:42.457 --> 02:49:46.320]  I mean, these guys, these guys are completely out of control, man.
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:48.001]  My head's spinning, though.
[02:49:48.742 --> 02:49:50.183]  It's one thing to have the New York Times
[02:49:52.421 --> 02:49:54.102]  You know, other famous fake news outlets.
[02:49:54.142 --> 02:49:56.764]  But then to have Lester Holt going, I'm scared.
[02:49:56.804 --> 02:49:57.984]  He wants criminal behavior.
[02:49:58.225 --> 02:49:59.585]  He called for criminal action.
[02:50:02.467 --> 02:50:04.228]  And they're like, oh my God, it's dangerous.
[02:50:04.508 --> 02:50:07.550]  Meanwhile, I'm like, in the very video, we do not want violence against the media.
[02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:09.672]  I believe they're getting ready to stage against themselves.
[02:50:09.692 --> 02:50:10.452]  They go, what do we do?
[02:50:10.812 --> 02:50:12.673]  He's telling people we're getting ready to stage stuff on ourselves.
[02:50:13.634 --> 02:50:15.335]  Just say he said, attack us.
[02:50:16.776 --> 02:50:18.537]  They're like, that's the way to do it.
[02:50:22.179 --> 02:50:24.520]  And then also, well, this internet ban's gonna go badly.
[02:50:24.861 --> 02:50:26.201]  When we ban him, it could make him a martyr.
[02:50:26.462 --> 02:50:30.444]  Leave up his tweets, misrepresent him, drag it out for a few weeks, and then delete him there.
[02:50:30.464 --> 02:50:33.426]  I'm like, absolutely, that's the plan.
[02:50:34.186 --> 02:50:35.687]  Beautiful, beautiful.
[02:50:37.949 --> 02:50:40.090]  And there's no doubt about the bad faith of Twitter now, man.
[02:50:40.110 --> 02:50:50.076]  Videos where I'm like, I did not call for violence, that is not true, here's a link to the real full video, here's how they edited it, the video they put out, I don't say that.
[02:50:51.676 --> 02:50:52.997]  Wow, man.
[02:50:53.577 --> 02:50:54.698]  But I'm betting on you.
[02:50:54.898 --> 02:50:55.799]  I think you're smart.
[02:50:56.900 --> 02:50:57.840]  I think you're involved.
[02:50:58.541 --> 02:50:59.381]  I think you're awake.
[02:51:00.462 --> 02:51:02.503]  And I think this is gonna backfire on them.
[02:51:03.324 --> 02:51:03.984]  I really think it is.
[02:51:04.024 --> 02:51:18.514]  You know, the number one thing you can do is realize they're gonna win if you don't person to person, ear to ear, mouth to mouth, voting with your feet, tell everybody you know, hey, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com,
[02:51:19.978 --> 02:51:21.059]  It's the verboten sight.
[02:51:21.159 --> 02:51:22.159]  It's the one they're lying about.
[02:51:22.179 --> 02:51:22.940]  They're demonizing.
[02:51:22.980 --> 02:51:24.540]  Go hear what he actually says for yourself.
[02:51:26.461 --> 02:51:32.324]  Anybody that listens regularly knows I say we don't want a shooting war and we sure as hell don't want to start it.
[02:51:35.526 --> 02:51:38.487]  And that just like Lexington and Concord, we're not looking for a shooting war.
[02:51:38.507 --> 02:51:39.468]  We're not going to shoot first.
[02:51:39.908 --> 02:51:42.189]  But if they shoot first, well then we'll defend ourselves.
[02:51:42.889 --> 02:51:46.011]  That turns into attack the media with battle rifles?
[02:51:49.758 --> 02:51:53.199]  Folks, I've been on the air 24 years almost, but it's 24 years now.
[02:51:53.819 --> 02:51:56.580]  I've never seen lying anywhere near this.
[02:51:57.061 --> 02:51:59.561]  I mean, this is wild lying.
[02:52:00.822 --> 02:52:14.947]  This is them all together learning how to be big liars and then just using formulaics where the media matters puts out the lie with the text of what I said with quotes all on single words.
[02:52:16.988 --> 02:52:17.468]  I mean, look at this.
[02:52:17.988 --> 02:52:18.988]  Here's an example of how you can do this.
[02:52:19.409 --> 02:52:19.909]  Twitter, Inc.
[02:52:19.929 --> 02:52:22.129]  has blocked right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:52:22.989 --> 02:52:36.452]  You could flip this around and say, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, that'd be clip number one, has blocked, that's number two, Twitter, Inc.'
[02:52:36.432 --> 02:52:43.594]  's number three, number four is according to multiple reports, and then I would add,
[02:52:44.949 --> 02:52:47.951]  Number five, why Twitter has been blocked and taken off the air.
[02:52:50.713 --> 02:52:53.555]  After calls on followers to prepare for violence.
[02:52:54.076 --> 02:52:55.037]  So did you hear Twitter?
[02:52:56.378 --> 02:53:03.123]  Twitter called for its followers to prepare for violence, which is what the Democrats, they actually do allow them to do that on there, but this is edited.
[02:53:03.683 --> 02:53:09.547]  So you see, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has blocked right-wing Twitter Inc.
[02:53:10.268 --> 02:53:11.729]  according to multiple media reports.
[02:53:13.170 --> 02:53:13.690]  Number five,
[02:53:14.815 --> 02:53:17.237]  After their calls on followers to prepare for violence.
[02:53:17.818 --> 02:53:22.982]  With battle rifles to fight Antifa, the mainstream media, and Chi Com operatives.
[02:53:25.444 --> 02:53:26.685]  Now that's a pretty simple trick.
[02:53:28.527 --> 02:53:37.875]  In 8th grade, you would get a F minus for that.
[02:53:37.935 --> 02:53:38.776]  You would fail the class.
[02:53:43.084 --> 02:53:43.484]  F-minus.
[02:53:43.885 --> 02:53:48.527]  It's not much better of a lie than something like this, saying Jones has a swastika on his head.
[02:53:48.547 --> 02:53:49.308]  Yeah, but you drew it.
[02:53:50.749 --> 02:53:52.750]  Roger Stone had some Nazis attacking him.
[02:53:53.190 --> 02:53:54.271]  He said, oh, look at these idiots.
[02:53:55.212 --> 02:54:00.715]  Apple News took a screenshot of it, cutting out the fact they were attacking him, and said, look, Roger Stone likes Nazis.
[02:54:01.736 --> 02:54:04.077]  He's coming in next hour with huge news.
[02:54:06.118 --> 02:54:06.759]  But I gotta tell you.
[02:54:07.836 --> 02:54:12.898]  I'm not scared, I'm scared for the country because I've never seen lies this out of control.
[02:54:16.180 --> 02:54:25.284]  You see how they can take a transcript of a 20 minute or hour long video or whatever I do, sometimes these periscopes are an hour and a half long, and they could create whatever they wanted.
[02:54:25.384 --> 02:54:30.146]  I just read to you that Twitter has been banned off the internet because they call for violence.
[02:54:30.426 --> 02:54:31.006]  It's not true.
[02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:34.148]  I mean, they have their people calling for it, they let them do it, but that's true.
[02:54:34.168 --> 02:54:36.489]  But the way I did those quotes,
[02:54:39.394 --> 02:54:39.935]  That's not true.
[02:54:40.675 --> 02:54:47.161]  We should call that little piece of video, learn how the New York Times and Ledster Holt defraud their readers and viewers.
[02:54:47.942 --> 02:54:49.203]  Because that's what this segment is.
[02:54:52.046 --> 02:54:53.307]  Holt will talk about Twilight Zone.
[02:54:53.367 --> 02:54:55.409]  Tosh Plumlee's a famous CIA whistleblower.
[02:54:55.970 --> 02:54:57.251]  His phone's great at other times.
[02:54:57.311 --> 02:55:02.536]  Today, it's cutting in and out, blaring jazz music over him where we couldn't even have him on.
[02:55:05.936 --> 02:55:06.456]  Coincidence!
[02:55:06.496 --> 02:55:09.457]  Soros invests in tech giants months before Infowars bans.
[02:55:10.657 --> 02:55:11.158]  Jamie White.
[02:55:11.198 --> 02:55:11.938]  Well, that's no coincidence.
[02:55:11.958 --> 02:55:13.098]  He called for tech giants to censor.
[02:55:13.478 --> 02:55:15.939]  Former Trump advisor shares meme of president wearing swastika.
[02:55:16.299 --> 02:55:16.799]  Spacesuit.
[02:55:17.660 --> 02:55:20.460]  But they cut it off, showing he was showing what idiots have put out against the president.
[02:55:20.701 --> 02:55:21.481]  Saying, look at these idiots.
[02:55:22.221 --> 02:55:23.641]  No, see, Roger Stone has swastikas.
[02:55:24.482 --> 02:55:28.163]  I mean... Jesus, these people.
[02:55:28.183 --> 02:55:30.324]  I mean, they are going for broke.
[02:55:30.484 --> 02:55:32.784]  They believe they can overpower you, but they can't.
[02:55:34.105 --> 02:55:34.925]  If you take action.
[02:55:37.773 --> 02:55:41.375]  We're running giant specials right now and you can see nobody's under attack like we are.
[02:55:42.256 --> 02:55:43.657]  They want to shut us down so bad.
[02:55:43.677 --> 02:55:47.959]  If you will just go to Infowarshore.com, you need X2.
[02:55:48.059 --> 02:55:56.624]  It changed my life where I hardly even work out and weigh less than I did 10 years ago because it's the missing link in all the big studies with IQ, libido, energy, stamina.
[02:55:56.644 --> 02:55:59.286]  You need the pure, good iodine that actually goes into your body.
[02:55:59.326 --> 02:55:59.926]  This is it, X2.
[02:56:01.343 --> 02:56:02.745]  We're working on something even more powerful.

[02:56:40.022 --> 02:56:40.682]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:56:41.443 --> 02:56:49.171]  I think this is all going to backfire, but I've got to tell you, we've been de-platformed for a year and a half.
[02:56:49.811 --> 02:56:51.413]  So the de-platforming blew up in their face.
[02:56:52.114 --> 02:56:53.455]  Because people just went, oh yeah, that's 1984.
[02:56:54.736 --> 02:57:00.762]  But now man, they are, CNN's calling me a terrorist, he's been arrested with no proof, no link, it's like Twilight Zone.
[02:57:01.082 --> 02:57:02.504]  That article's on Infowars.com.
[02:57:03.923 --> 02:57:09.047]  They're saying that I'm calling for battle rifles to be used against the media.
[02:57:09.447 --> 02:57:10.428]  The last thing I want.
[02:57:10.528 --> 02:57:15.511]  And they won't let me put on Twitter that I didn't say it.
[02:57:15.651 --> 02:57:19.294]  God help us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:19.454 --> 02:57:20.155]  God help us.
[02:57:20.215 --> 02:57:22.436]  But big stuff's coming.
[02:57:22.456 --> 02:57:23.277]  Trump's fighting hard.
[02:57:23.317 --> 02:57:27.460]  It's a good sign that he just took the national security clearance away from that globalist traitor.
[02:57:28.921 --> 02:57:30.602]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:32.972 --> 02:57:36.214]  So ahead of the midterms, they're trying to get you back under their control.
[02:57:37.655 --> 02:57:40.417]  They're trying really, really hard, and we'll see if they can break us.
[02:57:41.278 --> 02:57:42.779]  Just pray to Jesus to heal this land.
[02:57:42.839 --> 02:57:44.340]  My God, help us.
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:48.462]  We'll be right back with the 4th Hour of Roger Stone with Bombshell Info.
[02:57:48.482 --> 02:57:48.883]  Stay with us.

[02:58:03.189 --> 02:58:07.451]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.

[02:58:57.541 --> 02:58:58.081]  You're on the air.
[02:58:58.101 --> 02:58:59.262]  Thanks for holding.
[02:58:59.282 --> 02:59:00.142]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:59:00.322 --> 02:59:00.922]  Hey, brother.
[02:59:01.242 --> 02:59:01.602]  Good, man.
[02:59:01.623 --> 02:59:02.423]  Thank you for calling.
[02:59:02.503 --> 02:59:03.063]  Hey, hey.
[02:59:03.163 --> 02:59:07.585]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:59:07.785 --> 02:59:14.167]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:59:14.287 --> 02:59:15.987]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:59:16.087 --> 02:59:21.729]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:59:23.390 --> 02:59:24.511]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:59:24.571 --> 02:59:27.013]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:59:27.073 --> 02:59:28.575]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:59:28.975 --> 02:59:30.577]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:59:31.037 --> 02:59:31.758]  And exactly.
[02:59:31.778 --> 02:59:36.042]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:59:36.382 --> 02:59:36.642]  Boom!
[02:59:36.802 --> 02:59:39.625]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:59:39.685 --> 02:59:40.225]  It's amazing.
[02:59:40.265 --> 02:59:41.567]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:59:41.647 --> 02:59:44.509]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:59:53.399 --> 03:00:00.341]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:03.182 --> 03:00:05.383]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:05.883 --> 03:00:11.005]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:28.495 --> 03:00:31.277]  Political outrage turns bloody in Berkeley.
[03:00:31.418 --> 03:00:41.285]  Our KPIX 5 crews were right in the middle of the chaos as both Trump supporters and anti-Trump activists come to blows.
[03:00:41.345 --> 03:00:45.288]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center.
[03:00:45.388 --> 03:00:50.552]  Around the corner and away from police protection on San Carlos Street, a mob mentality took over.
[03:00:50.592 --> 03:00:51.472]  You're under arrest!
[03:00:51.853 --> 03:00:53.494]  You're under arrest!
[03:00:54.648 --> 03:00:58.230]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[03:00:58.331 --> 03:00:59.051]  Oh my goodness!
[03:00:59.091 --> 03:00:59.872]  Poor white people!
[03:00:59.912 --> 03:01:00.352]  Please!
[03:01:00.492 --> 03:01:00.852]  Stop!
[03:01:00.992 --> 03:01:02.453]  These were pure attacks.
[03:01:02.914 --> 03:01:08.878]  Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly, left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[03:01:09.578 --> 03:01:14.141]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day with blood streaming out of his face.
[03:01:14.361 --> 03:01:17.143]  Pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters got into it.
[03:01:24.956 --> 03:01:25.650]  And now they're rushing.
[03:01:37.830 --> 03:01:47.597]  We're saying, if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[03:01:47.617 --> 03:01:48.597]  It got ugly.
[03:01:48.657 --> 03:01:52.540]  Violence erupting at the event as fights broke out.
[03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:57.423]  Fists flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters.
[03:01:57.943 --> 03:01:58.744]  It gets pretty ugly.
[03:01:58.964 --> 03:02:02.767]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home, you're about to see some very violent footage.
[03:02:09.952 --> 03:02:19.638]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious fringe allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[03:02:19.678 --> 03:02:24.342]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[03:02:24.362 --> 03:02:26.223]  You don't like, you don't like, get the f*** out.
[03:02:26.243 --> 03:02:27.404]  Just to strike the numbers.
[03:02:27.724 --> 03:02:28.424]  I'll give it to you.
[03:02:28.464 --> 03:02:31.967]  Liv, if you want to come out, you better be up a hundred of you against one of me, because that's what it's going to take.
[03:02:45.639 --> 03:02:57.170]  Alright, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[03:02:57.190 --> 03:03:02.415]  You're going to get a world exclusive about one of Donald Trump's black girlfriends, very beautiful lady.
[03:03:04.116 --> 03:03:09.621]  And so that's coming up, just to talk about, you've known him 40 years, have you ever heard anything racist talk in the n-word talk?
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:12.882]  We're going to get the straight scooper from Roger Stone next segment.
[03:03:12.902 --> 03:03:15.704]  We're going to get into them with a hidden swastika.
[03:03:15.724 --> 03:03:17.325]  When I first showed it to me, I didn't see it.
[03:03:17.345 --> 03:03:20.467]  It looks like a Space Force logo on their lapels.
[03:03:20.527 --> 03:03:21.948]  So you tweeted out saying, oh, look at this.
[03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:24.070]  They go, oh, look, you're a Nazi for tweeting it out.
[03:03:24.570 --> 03:03:26.111]  No, you didn't notice that it was hidden there.
[03:03:26.131 --> 03:03:28.333]  Because the one I saw on the computer is darker than that.
[03:03:29.614 --> 03:03:30.915]  Obviously, why would you do that anyways?
[03:03:30.955 --> 03:03:32.436]  But this is all they've got.
[03:03:32.476 --> 03:03:34.197]  They're just flooding everything.
[03:03:36.693 --> 03:03:40.438]  They're totally desperate right now, when actually George Soros is the Nazi collaborator.
[03:03:40.458 --> 03:03:41.760]  But we're going to stop right there.
[03:03:42.821 --> 03:03:44.784]  Roger, we're going to break here in just a few minutes.
[03:03:44.804 --> 03:03:45.665]  Good to have you in the studio.
[03:03:46.526 --> 03:03:49.309]  What do you make of the lies of Lester Holt?
[03:03:49.349 --> 03:03:53.034]  We'll talk more about when we come back, but they're literally taking articles
[03:03:54.236 --> 03:04:04.179]  And they are taking one word here, one word there, one word and putting them together in fake sentences and then saying I said go attack news organizations with battle rifles.
[03:04:04.239 --> 03:04:05.460]  I never said any such thing.
[03:04:05.480 --> 03:04:08.501]  In the very video I said they're going to stage an event on themselves.
[03:04:09.201 --> 03:04:11.783]  They're hyping it, we want to stop this.
[03:04:12.303 --> 03:04:16.427]  I literally said we do not want to be violent and they literally take that and say I'm being violent.
[03:04:16.827 --> 03:04:26.835]  No, look, it reminds me of just a couple days ago when we posted a video on YouTube and they said, Jones put up a video of an adult beating a child.
[03:04:27.155 --> 03:04:29.297]  He's advocating violence against children.
[03:04:29.337 --> 03:04:34.541]  When you didn't say anything of the kind and they won't show you the video so it can be disproved.
[03:04:35.281 --> 03:04:37.683]  The amazing thing about this is, you called it.
[03:04:37.883 --> 03:04:39.424]  You called it from the beginning.
[03:04:39.824 --> 03:04:49.931]  They would take what you actually said, they would then distort it, use it as the basis for a lawsuit, generate headlines, use those headlines to knock us off the social media.
[03:04:49.951 --> 03:04:52.773]  So let's lay out what comes next, because this is definitely the main assault.
[03:04:52.813 --> 03:04:57.496]  They're coming, hopefully Trump knows it, he just took a security clearance from one of these pieces of crap.
[03:05:00.993 --> 03:05:07.415]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[03:05:07.495 --> 03:05:14.296]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[03:05:14.316 --> 03:05:29.840]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:05:30.925 --> 03:05:34.628]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:05:34.788 --> 03:05:39.852]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:05:40.012 --> 03:05:41.193]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:41.333 --> 03:05:42.954]  It is absolutely free.
[03:05:43.154 --> 03:05:48.138]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:05:48.378 --> 03:05:52.021]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:05:52.141 --> 03:05:56.244]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[03:05:56.465 --> 03:06:00.568]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:06:13.906 --> 03:06:20.233]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:20.814 --> 03:06:27.681]  Okay, so I did a video Monday night that they deleted off Twitter, but we're gonna repost it.
[03:06:27.721 --> 03:06:28.162]  We found it.
[03:06:30.194 --> 03:06:43.000]  Somebody else had posted on YouTube, it was a live stream, where I said we've got to stop violence, the left wants to attack themselves, they're getting ready for a false flag against the media, they're hyping that people are going to come bomb them or shoot them, and saying Trump's promoting that when they're the ones promoting violence, Trump's just responding to them.
[03:06:43.501 --> 03:06:54.426]  They took it and edited words out, but didn't even put a video out on the New York Times, or NBC, or Lester Holt, and said that I'm calling for attacking the media, and now CNN says I'm a domestic terrorist that must be arrested.
[03:06:55.026 --> 03:06:57.968]  Media Matters did put the video out, it's edited, but still shows nothing.
[03:07:00.783 --> 03:07:07.747]  I've never seen this magnitude, even when they take Trump and edit the words down, where he says there are a lot of great people coming across the border.
[03:07:07.767 --> 03:07:11.128]  I want to make it easier if you're hard-working and not a criminal.
[03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:14.430]  But you also got a lot of criminals coming across, rapists and murderers.
[03:07:14.830 --> 03:07:27.237]  Headline, Trump, Mexicans, quote, are all, he didn't say that, there's no quotes on them, Mexicans as a quote, he said Mexicans, are all, no quote, rapist, quote,
[03:07:28.311 --> 03:07:29.072]  Murderer's quote.
[03:07:29.952 --> 03:07:35.757]  And again, in 8th grade English, you would get an F minus if you quoted people.
[03:07:37.619 --> 03:07:41.542]  If George Washington said, I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down the cherry tree.
[03:07:43.243 --> 03:07:44.464]  And then you turned it around.
[03:07:44.484 --> 03:07:46.526]  I tell lies.
[03:07:47.247 --> 03:07:48.568]  I did not chop down the cherry tree.
[03:07:50.424 --> 03:07:56.489]  See, one word, they do it, and I mean, this is 101 English, and my thing is, do they think their readers are stupid?
[03:07:56.749 --> 03:07:58.610]  What they do is they fence it, like you steal something.
[03:07:59.131 --> 03:08:16.824]  First they have Media Matters put it out, then it gets worse and worse, like telephone, by the end of it, and I'm like, dude, Lester Holt, man, I didn't want to come after the media, but I want to come after you with lawsuits now, you lion, piece of filth, man, I am pissed, man, I am, look, look, look, Trump basically called
[03:08:17.604 --> 03:08:19.045]  Basically.
[03:08:19.145 --> 03:08:21.746]  God, it's incredible, man!
[03:08:22.086 --> 03:08:26.668]  It's insidious, but Alex, it's a testimony to your effectiveness.
[03:08:27.069 --> 03:08:28.569]  Would they be attacking InfoWars?
[03:08:28.609 --> 03:08:31.311]  Would they be trying to wipe us off all of these platforms?
[03:08:31.591 --> 03:08:37.453]  Would they be waging this war of distortion against us if we weren't the cutting edge of the revolution?
[03:08:37.493 --> 03:08:38.914]  If we were not the tip of the spear?
[03:08:39.414 --> 03:08:44.537]  They're desperate to shut us up because we have revealed the phoniness of the Mueller
[03:08:45.117 --> 03:08:53.566]  Probe, because we have exposed the effort to take Trump down because we're constantly correcting the mainstream media and pointing out their lies.
[03:08:54.107 --> 03:08:55.949]  That is why they're trying to silence us.
[03:08:55.969 --> 03:08:56.289]  No, that's it!
[03:08:56.309 --> 03:08:56.870]  Here's the problem!
[03:08:58.035 --> 03:09:01.816]  They want to silence me where I have no voice, where they can say I'm a child molester like them!
[03:09:02.256 --> 03:09:02.656]  Exactly.
[03:09:02.676 --> 03:09:07.378]  We just had 3,000 of these, 300 of these people raping thousands of kids just got busted.
[03:09:07.698 --> 03:09:08.478]  Just like we told them.
[03:09:08.538 --> 03:09:14.440]  I mean, they want to silence us so they can really, let me tell you, they know we got a big voice still, and they're doing this kind of crap?
[03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:15.961]  What the hell does Lester Holt think?
[03:09:16.401 --> 03:09:19.942]  Well, and this, so, I gotta... I'm gonna tell Lester Holt something right now.
[03:09:25.526 --> 03:09:28.989]  You sit there and you lie about me before you guys false flag your own facilities?
[03:09:29.569 --> 03:09:34.454]  I guarantee you in the final equation, this country and the judicial process will hold you accountable.
[03:09:34.794 --> 03:09:40.499]  You lying, evil, sack of filth that tried to throw the election for Hillary in those debates.
[03:09:40.859 --> 03:09:43.201]  You are a disgraceful monster!
[03:09:43.481 --> 03:09:47.505]  And you know full well what you're doing, you assassin of truth, you pig!
[03:09:47.525 --> 03:09:48.265]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:09:48.305 --> 03:09:49.286]  No, they're not journalists.
[03:09:49.326 --> 03:09:50.247]  That's really the point.
[03:09:50.307 --> 03:09:51.248]  People like Lester Holt.
[03:09:51.448 --> 03:09:53.989]  He is a cowardly nobody.
[03:09:54.069 --> 03:09:55.070]  He's a partisan.
[03:09:55.110 --> 03:09:56.231]  They're all partisans, look.
[03:09:56.671 --> 03:09:59.473]  Yeah, but I'm a partisan for capitalism and Christianity.
[03:09:59.673 --> 03:10:01.153]  Doesn't mean I lie about people.
[03:10:01.414 --> 03:10:06.436]  I'm going to take a Lester Holt report, and I'm going to turn the whole thing around.
[03:10:06.456 --> 03:10:11.379]  I'm going to take one about child molesters, and I'm going to turn it into he says he's a child molester by reading one word quotes together.
[03:10:11.699 --> 03:10:14.061]  And at the end, I'm going to say Lester Holt didn't actually say this.
[03:10:14.341 --> 03:10:17.723]  But I'm telling you, man, you are a criminal piece of filth!
[03:10:18.773 --> 03:10:20.634]  Goddamn you, you son of a bitch!
[03:10:21.335 --> 03:10:21.775]  It's time.
[03:10:21.835 --> 03:10:22.896]  Excuse me, just delete that.
[03:10:23.176 --> 03:10:24.036]  Delay that right now.
[03:10:24.056 --> 03:10:27.318]  Oh boy, I'm getting pissed now.
[03:10:27.598 --> 03:10:30.000]  Look, this is the way the battle goes.
[03:10:30.060 --> 03:10:34.262]  I'm sure most of our watchers and readers saw the big, big breaking news.
[03:10:34.842 --> 03:10:35.723]  Enormous story.
[03:10:35.843 --> 03:10:45.629]  Roger Stone posted on his Instagram account an image of the Trump team in space outfits and it included a swastika.
[03:10:46.269 --> 03:10:47.270]  Well, it's true.
[03:10:47.570 --> 03:10:48.931]  I didn't notice the swastika.
[03:10:49.411 --> 03:10:52.013]  I was proud to be in the company they depicted me with.
[03:10:52.053 --> 03:10:54.936]  Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, and others.
[03:10:54.996 --> 03:10:56.036]  And notice how they spin that.
[03:10:56.777 --> 03:10:58.558]  Like you actually wore a swastika.
[03:10:58.618 --> 03:10:58.779]  No.
[03:10:59.019 --> 03:11:01.801]  In your huge feet, you didn't see the swastika halfway hidden.
[03:11:02.081 --> 03:11:03.102]  You sent it out as a joke.
[03:11:04.063 --> 03:11:09.307]  And I said, I'm proud to be in this group, but what they're saying about us is a lie.
[03:11:09.367 --> 03:11:10.628]  That's what I actually said.
[03:11:11.189 --> 03:11:13.651]  When I saw it had a swastika, I deleted it.
[03:11:13.951 --> 03:11:15.372]  Then I put up an explanation.
[03:11:15.652 --> 03:11:17.974]  But you won't find any stories about the explanation.
[03:11:18.054 --> 03:11:20.496]  All you'll find are the fake news stories.
[03:11:20.917 --> 03:11:21.017]  Oh!
[03:11:21.337 --> 03:11:23.038]  Stone posted a swastika!
[03:11:23.298 --> 03:11:24.540]  As if I intended to do it.
[03:11:24.660 --> 03:11:25.761]  As if I did it willfully.
[03:11:25.781 --> 03:11:26.321]  Here's the problem.
[03:11:26.341 --> 03:11:28.483]  When you're busy, and I have the screen turned down in there,
[03:11:28.863 --> 03:11:30.904]  This is not real bright, because you know that's bad for your eyes.
[03:11:30.944 --> 03:11:32.764]  I walked in on these screens, it's bright, I can see it.
[03:11:33.204 --> 03:11:36.405]  On a dark screen, I know you have your screen turned down, it hurts your eyes.
[03:11:36.845 --> 03:11:38.006]  I was like, where's the swastika?
[03:11:38.026 --> 03:11:39.706]  And then they turned the screen up and I could see it.
[03:11:39.746 --> 03:11:40.146]  Yeah, no.
[03:11:40.186 --> 03:11:41.887]  You can't see it when the screen's turned down.
[03:11:41.967 --> 03:11:43.507]  Which almost, I think, they trolled you.
[03:11:43.527 --> 03:11:46.828]  Because when the screen's turned down, like I have my phone turned down, I can show people.
[03:11:47.649 --> 03:11:50.689]  I have my phone turned down, you know, because blue light's bad for your eyes.
[03:11:51.130 --> 03:11:52.070]  Something like that you can't see.
[03:11:53.138 --> 03:11:53.959]  I think that's likely.
[03:11:53.999 --> 03:12:00.022]  The guy who sent this to me was a left-wing Democrat in Florida, and he sent it with some insulting message.
[03:12:00.742 --> 03:12:06.285]  I just looked at the image of me and Trump and a bunch of other guys in spacesuits, and I liked it.
[03:12:06.445 --> 03:12:09.887]  And I commented favorably on the fact that I liked the company.
[03:12:10.387 --> 03:12:11.088]  What the hell was that?
[03:12:11.228 --> 03:12:11.949]  I have no idea.
[03:12:11.969 --> 03:12:14.191]  I have no idea.
[03:12:14.231 --> 03:12:16.673]  I lost all my audio, so whatever.
[03:12:17.414 --> 03:12:18.075]  We'll figure it out.
[03:12:18.335 --> 03:12:18.896]  Keep going.
[03:12:19.396 --> 03:12:23.781]  So the point of this is that this was inadvertent.
[03:12:23.981 --> 03:12:25.222]  It was a mistake.
[03:12:25.422 --> 03:12:28.706]  It was something I regretted doing and I took it down immediately.
[03:12:28.726 --> 03:12:30.588]  20 media reports.
[03:12:30.928 --> 03:12:33.410]  Let me read my favorite from something called Daily Dot.
[03:12:34.011 --> 03:12:37.033]  That says, um, pardon, that's incorrect, Splinter News.
[03:12:37.713 --> 03:12:40.795]  Trump confidant and Richard Nixon loving lunatic.
[03:12:40.855 --> 03:12:41.115]  Really?
[03:12:41.155 --> 03:12:43.316]  The guy who ended the war in Vietnam?
[03:12:43.376 --> 03:12:46.158]  The guy who reached a strategic arms limitation with the Russians?
[03:12:46.178 --> 03:12:48.339]  The guy that opened the door to China?
[03:12:48.379 --> 03:12:51.101]  The guy who saved Israel in the 1973 war?
[03:12:51.381 --> 03:12:53.182]  The guy who desegregated the public schools?
[03:12:53.202 --> 03:12:54.062]  That Richard Nixon?
[03:12:54.082 --> 03:12:55.563]  The one who gave us affirmative action?
[03:12:55.903 --> 03:12:57.184]  Yeah, that Richard Nixon.
[03:12:57.224 --> 03:12:59.986]  By the way, online, what's AVG?
[03:13:00.466 --> 03:13:03.228]  It looks like a... looks like a...
[03:13:06.258 --> 03:13:14.020]  Symbol of Windows, but it says now that antivirus stuff, this site can't be reached.
[03:13:15.981 --> 03:13:17.101]  So what's AVG?
[03:13:17.221 --> 03:13:20.022]  AVG is now blocking InfoWars as its malware site.
[03:13:20.362 --> 03:13:21.662]  Just thought you could pass this along.
[03:13:21.782 --> 03:13:23.162]  I mean, I can't sue all these people.
[03:13:23.743 --> 03:13:24.983]  The listeners are going to have to do it.
[03:13:25.023 --> 03:13:26.343]  Your internal problem with earpieces.
[03:13:26.703 --> 03:13:28.204]  Yeah, no, the earpieces are fine.
[03:13:28.224 --> 03:13:29.164]  What is squeaking over there?
[03:13:29.304 --> 03:13:30.064]  I have no idea.
[03:13:30.104 --> 03:13:33.105]  I think my phone set it off in some way, but we've turned the phone off.
[03:13:33.505 --> 03:13:40.995]  Anyways, I mean, they are, let me tell you, this is like super cyber attack on all of Trump's base ahead of the election.
[03:13:41.035 --> 03:13:41.716]  This is happening.
[03:13:41.736 --> 03:13:42.737]  They're talking about election meddling.
[03:13:43.017 --> 03:13:47.703]  They're doing it right now with Senator Warner and Murphy saying, shut us all down.
[03:13:48.164 --> 03:13:49.505]  Where are the congressional hearings?
[03:13:50.506 --> 03:13:52.568]  Look, a couple things have to happen here.
[03:13:52.608 --> 03:14:12.642]  First of all, the President of the United States needs to wake up and understand the danger to himself and his party and his re-election and to the 2018 elections and order the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust to move on these companies, Facebook, Twitter and so on, because they're engaging in antitrust monopolistic practices that violate U.S.
[03:14:12.702 --> 03:14:12.882]  law.
[03:14:13.482 --> 03:14:28.165]  Secondarily, we have to rely again on the same band of patriots in the House, people like Jim Jordan, and Ron DeSantis, and Matt Gaetz, and others who have been the only ones to have the courage to raise us.
[03:14:28.445 --> 03:14:30.385]  You don't see it coming from the Republican leadership.
[03:14:30.745 --> 03:14:32.846]  You don't see Paul Ryan talking about internet censorship.
[03:14:32.866 --> 03:14:33.426]  I totally agree.
[03:14:33.866 --> 03:14:39.807]  I've now confirmed the free antivirus system, AVG, is calling us malware, which is fraud.
[03:14:40.598 --> 03:14:44.002]  This is definitely who I should sue, because we're looking to just send a message, you know.
[03:14:44.842 --> 03:14:49.287]  AVG is now saying that we are fraudulent.
[03:14:50.068 --> 03:14:51.509]  AVG is now reportedly
[03:14:52.725 --> 03:14:59.467]  Sending out messages that we are malware, meaning we load stuff on your computer, which is not true.
[03:14:59.487 --> 03:15:01.288]  I mean, let me tell you, that's what I'm saying.
[03:15:01.308 --> 03:15:02.408]  The left has gone crazy.
[03:15:02.448 --> 03:15:03.328]  Document Cam, shot, please.
[03:15:04.089 --> 03:15:08.930]  They are going completely insane, where they're doing stuff that is just unheard of.
[03:15:08.990 --> 03:15:15.232]  We had a Fortune 20 company that does some of our software, say, oh, you can no longer use our software, even though it's paid for, we have a contract.
[03:15:15.632 --> 03:15:18.153]  And we had to talk to the top people, they go, oh no, that was a mistake, forget it.
[03:15:18.673 --> 03:15:19.734]  That was a rogue employee.
[03:15:19.814 --> 03:15:20.994]  This is going insane.
[03:15:22.244 --> 03:15:26.926]  Well, in the meantime, you have a media obsessed with Omarosa.
[03:15:27.466 --> 03:15:34.830]  She said last night that Donald Trump definitely knew about the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks in advance.
[03:15:35.270 --> 03:15:36.390]  I don't know how she would know that.
[03:15:36.791 --> 03:15:38.692]  He most certainly did not get them from me.
[03:15:39.132 --> 03:15:41.833]  And she goes on to say, well, it's a good thing they're investigating Roger Stone.
[03:15:41.873 --> 03:15:43.214]  He's a shady character.
[03:15:43.594 --> 03:15:45.675]  Lady, look in the mirror.
[03:15:45.695 --> 03:15:48.196]  How much shadier do you get than that?
[03:15:49.645 --> 03:15:50.367]  See something else.
[03:15:50.387 --> 03:15:56.178]  We'll be right back to break down Trump's African-American girlfriend and more super exclusive Straight Ahead.
[03:15:56.198 --> 03:15:56.538]  Stay with us.
[03:15:56.558 --> 03:15:57.680]  Spread the word however you can.
[03:16:03.996 --> 03:16:05.597]  Hate is such a malleable term.
[03:16:05.677 --> 03:16:09.461]  I mean, you know, hate really means something, an opinion I don't agree with.
[03:16:09.681 --> 03:16:17.367]  Because if you want to get rid of hate speech, I mean, I don't see how anything you've said is anywhere close to what that New York Times columnist you showed earlier saying.
[03:16:17.627 --> 03:16:19.369]  Board members saying whites are subhuman.
[03:16:19.549 --> 03:16:23.052]  Yeah, I mean, how is that not hate speech if there is such a thing?
[03:16:23.092 --> 03:16:25.134]  I just hate that term, hate speech, because it's...
[03:16:25.794 --> 03:16:26.474]  It's not a thing.
[03:16:26.874 --> 03:16:33.857]  What really bothers me about your cases, just globally, is that I don't see anybody from the traditional media backing you up.
[03:16:33.877 --> 03:16:36.098]  And I don't understand how they can look at this.
[03:16:36.318 --> 03:16:41.319]  You know, you questioned the official narrative of what happened at Sandy Hook at some point.
[03:16:41.660 --> 03:16:44.401]  In the beginning, you said, you made an investigation.
[03:16:44.801 --> 03:16:53.904]  I don't care what happens, anything that happens, when I get an official story from my government, if I'm not questioning it, I want somebody else to question it to make me question it.
[03:16:54.384 --> 03:17:00.488]  Even if it comes around that, hey, maybe we're going to have a rare circumstance where our government doesn't lie to us one bit.
[03:17:00.508 --> 03:17:02.389]  I mean, it might happen once in a while.
[03:17:02.749 --> 03:17:03.709]  Unicorns beg Ziff.
[03:17:03.769 --> 03:17:06.931]  But the point of the media is to be a watchdog.
[03:17:06.971 --> 03:17:07.932]  You're the fourth estate.
[03:17:08.012 --> 03:17:10.753]  I take a lot of flack for coming on your show and representing you.
[03:17:11.194 --> 03:17:12.835]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[03:17:12.855 --> 03:17:14.596]  And I say, well, you know, tell me.
[03:17:15.356 --> 03:17:25.160]  If you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is, and they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article paraphrasing what you said.
[03:17:25.180 --> 03:17:27.622]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[03:17:28.142 --> 03:17:31.563]  And when I go find it, and I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[03:17:31.663 --> 03:17:33.444]  Well, then there's this back pedal.
[03:17:33.484 --> 03:17:36.846]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[03:17:36.866 --> 03:17:37.766]  I said, wait a second.
[03:17:37.786 --> 03:17:41.748]  What I want you to think about is how we need a robust marketplace of ideas.
[03:17:42.048 --> 03:17:45.129]  I don't come on your show because I agree with everything you have to say.
[03:17:45.209 --> 03:17:47.450]  You know, before the election, I wrote this article here.
[03:17:48.050 --> 03:17:51.151]  Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump on CNN?
[03:17:51.891 --> 03:17:53.072]  And I was concerned.
[03:17:54.052 --> 03:17:59.034]  Because when Trump made his speech that said, we're going to open up the libel law... I was concerned too.
[03:17:59.054 --> 03:17:59.834]  I don't think he got it.
[03:18:00.034 --> 03:18:03.755]  And it made me, I mean, I said, wow, that got my hackles up.
[03:18:03.915 --> 03:18:08.137]  I mean, I am not... But now in his own cases, he's using anti-slap.
[03:18:08.897 --> 03:18:09.837]  It's kind of funny, isn't it?
[03:18:09.857 --> 03:18:26.424]  You know, how this is flipped, because now that he got elected, now it is not Donald Trump, but people are anti-Donald Trump, who I should have written this article, I should have written another version of this article saying, is the First Amendment safe from people who have Trump derangement syndrome?
[03:18:27.024 --> 03:18:32.286]  You know, I remember last night we were talking and somebody said, you know, hey, has the right ever really done this?
[03:18:33.286 --> 03:18:38.451]  And I had to correct him, and I said, yes, if you bring the camera down here, heed their rising voices.
[03:18:38.471 --> 03:18:52.243]  New York Times versus Sullivan, the foundational case when it comes to our First Amendment rights, where it was constitutionalized that if you are talking about a public figure and then expand it to public events,
[03:18:53.084 --> 03:18:56.466]  You must prove defamation over the actual man.
[03:18:56.486 --> 03:18:59.589]  And this was the South of the KKK suing everybody to shut down the base.
[03:18:59.609 --> 03:19:00.209]  That's exactly what it was.
[03:19:00.249 --> 03:19:02.911]  It was exactly what you have going on today.
[03:19:03.111 --> 03:19:15.059]  It was the civil rights movement was invading the South with people who were writing about equality, with people who were trying to make this idea of equality and civil rights infected.
[03:19:15.119 --> 03:19:16.760]  You know, they were trying to spread this idea.
[03:19:17.121 --> 03:19:18.962]  And how did these people who wanted to fight
[03:19:19.002 --> 03:19:19.503]  We're good to go.
[03:19:34.884 --> 03:19:36.025]  But I guess it's the Democrats again.
[03:19:36.105 --> 03:19:39.409]  Look, New York Times vs. Sullivan is sacred as far as I'm concerned.
[03:19:39.449 --> 03:19:43.533]  And you know, so far, I haven't seen Donald Trump actually do anything to go against it.
[03:19:43.914 --> 03:19:46.396]  I think his two Supreme Court nominees would support it.
[03:19:46.857 --> 03:19:49.880]  And I can't say the same for the Supreme Court nominees on the left.
[03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:53.263]  So... The Democrats are going after New York Times vs. Sullivan.
[03:19:53.884 --> 03:19:55.446]  At this point, it looks that way.
[03:19:55.486 --> 03:19:55.646]  Yeah.
[03:19:55.826 --> 03:19:56.146]  We'll be back.
[03:20:03.388 --> 03:20:06.130]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:21.320 --> 03:20:25.463]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:20:26.163 --> 03:20:27.544]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:29.085 --> 03:20:31.267]  I gotta tell ya, it is crazy.
[03:20:32.762 --> 03:20:36.304]  I do a whole video about the mainstream media wants to stage a terror attack against itself.
[03:20:36.765 --> 03:20:39.767]  I'm predicting a false flag to blame the alternative media.
[03:20:39.827 --> 03:20:41.028]  We do not want any violence.
[03:20:41.648 --> 03:20:42.669]  We're winning politically.
[03:20:42.749 --> 03:20:47.592]  And then they put out reports in the video, I said battle rifles attack the media.
[03:20:48.212 --> 03:20:51.915]  I mean, Roger, we're going to get to the big bombshell news actually next segment.
[03:20:51.955 --> 03:20:53.336]  You were talking about Mueller watches.
[03:20:53.856 --> 03:20:56.318]  Everything you do, the mainstream media is obsessed with us.
[03:20:56.398 --> 03:20:57.218]  It really is true.
[03:20:57.679 --> 03:20:58.579]  And we're big.
[03:20:59.060 --> 03:21:01.221]  But quite frankly, we go to an older audience.
[03:21:01.401 --> 03:21:02.362]  You go to an older audience.
[03:21:03.585 --> 03:21:09.084]  It's people like Stephen Crowder and Paul Watson that hit a younger audience.
[03:21:10.731 --> 03:21:17.254]  But, I mean, we're big, and we're big on terrestrial radio too, but there are folks bigger, even in the shadow bands, than us.
[03:21:17.874 --> 03:21:25.017]  I don't know why, with the agencies and the bluebloods, like Mueller and his whole elite rich family, why they hate us so much.
[03:21:25.077 --> 03:21:28.819]  But in a way, we're almost a good distraction from what the kids are doing.
[03:21:29.199 --> 03:21:32.361]  Because, like, for some reason, the establishment really gets
[03:21:33.161 --> 03:21:35.325]  They're, you know what, in a knickers over us.
[03:21:35.365 --> 03:21:35.986]  What do you think that is?
[03:21:36.006 --> 03:21:37.368]  You wanted to have a message to Mueller.
[03:21:37.408 --> 03:21:38.610]  You know, I'm not sure.
[03:21:38.770 --> 03:21:43.657]  Look, there's no question that the special counsel's office monitors these broadcasts.
[03:21:43.677 --> 03:21:45.240]  So let me be as clear as I possibly can.
[03:21:46.747 --> 03:21:51.488]  You can subpoena a dozen of my associates, two dozen, a hundred, a thousand.
[03:21:51.888 --> 03:21:55.749]  You will find no evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration.
[03:21:56.289 --> 03:22:04.311]  It'll never be able to be proven that I received anything from WikiLeaks or the Russians and passed it on to Donald Trump because it never happened.
[03:22:04.851 --> 03:22:10.512]  It's a left-wing conspiracy theory and it's threadbare, beaten to death by MSNBC.
[03:22:10.812 --> 03:22:12.452]  Unfortunately, it's false.
[03:22:12.972 --> 03:22:14.553]  So you're wasting your time.
[03:22:14.633 --> 03:22:16.093]  But Alex, I must tell you,
[03:22:16.593 --> 03:22:20.555]  I went to this Palm Beach County Republican gathering last Thursday.
[03:22:21.216 --> 03:22:22.716]  Five, six hundred people in the room.
[03:22:23.257 --> 03:22:26.198]  It was the young people who crowded me at the door.
[03:22:26.339 --> 03:22:29.280]  It was the young people saying, tell Alex Jones we're with him.
[03:22:29.520 --> 03:22:31.041]  Tell Alex Jones we love him.
[03:22:31.301 --> 03:22:32.182]  Tell Alex Jones we watch him.
[03:22:32.202 --> 03:22:33.723]  No, no, I want to be clear.
[03:22:33.843 --> 03:22:35.704]  I mean, I took my daughters to camp for three weeks.
[03:22:37.128 --> 03:22:41.212]  And we pull up, we're supposed to put the luggage out, and like all the young men are there.
[03:22:41.832 --> 03:22:43.394]  You know, it was their last year at camp.
[03:22:43.414 --> 03:22:44.214]  They're all listeners.
[03:22:44.695 --> 03:22:47.077]  I start seeing InfoWars stickers and others.
[03:22:47.597 --> 03:22:48.818]  So no, people love you too.
[03:22:49.319 --> 03:22:51.661]  With Generation Z, we're the hottest thing.
[03:22:51.701 --> 03:22:54.523]  I'm saying it's even hotter though with even the younger people.
[03:22:54.704 --> 03:22:55.504]  No, I totally agree.
[03:22:55.524 --> 03:22:55.985]  You're right.
[03:22:56.485 --> 03:22:56.865]  It's true.
[03:22:56.885 --> 03:22:58.547]  And I guess that's why they're so scared.
[03:22:59.127 --> 03:23:03.651]  Where the real damage is done, and Darren McBree mentioned this at lunch today, and he's absolutely right.
[03:23:04.392 --> 03:23:07.233]  It's the late night comics who are doing most of the damage.
[03:23:07.433 --> 03:23:16.275]  See, back in the days of Jay Leno and even Johnny Carson, they made political jokes at the expense of both the left and the right, and they were balanced and they were funny.
[03:23:16.675 --> 03:23:24.217]  But now all you get from Jimmy Kimmel and the rest of these late night talentless thugs is a constant barrage of hate.
[03:23:24.917 --> 03:23:26.039]  And there's no balance to it.
[03:23:26.079 --> 03:23:27.160]  There's no humor to it.
[03:23:27.180 --> 03:23:29.703]  They never punk Democrats or liberals.
[03:23:29.763 --> 03:23:33.467]  It's all aimed at Donald Trump or Alex Jones or and so on.
[03:23:33.848 --> 03:23:34.709]  And let's go further.
[03:23:35.409 --> 03:23:37.712]  Go to youtube.com and just type in Alex Jones.
[03:23:38.433 --> 03:23:38.853]  It is
[03:23:39.654 --> 03:23:48.837]  Anything my ex-wife says, anything Kimmel says, anything Colbert says, anything Oliver, whatever his name says, it's all lies.
[03:23:48.917 --> 03:23:49.958]  It's all disinfo.
[03:23:50.678 --> 03:23:55.059]  And they've already, on top of the shadow ban, again, they ban you and then they misrepresent you.
[03:23:55.099 --> 03:23:58.380]  And that's the worst part is, they then steal your identity.
[03:23:58.420 --> 03:23:58.820]  There it is.
[03:23:59.261 --> 03:24:01.421]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on Alex Jones.
[03:24:01.501 --> 03:24:02.062]  Time out.
[03:24:02.142 --> 03:24:04.602]  Like I'm some baby that I'm saying attack the media.
[03:24:04.843 --> 03:24:05.903]  Again, that's their top lie.
[03:24:07.859 --> 03:24:09.900]  Twitter suspends Alex Jones in citing violence.
[03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:11.540]  It's not true.
[03:24:12.040 --> 03:24:12.601]  Press for truth.
[03:24:12.641 --> 03:24:13.241]  Glad they got in.
[03:24:13.261 --> 03:24:14.221]  That'll be deleted probably.
[03:24:14.601 --> 03:24:15.641]  Infowars.com is down.
[03:24:15.682 --> 03:24:17.282]  Alex Jones wards an imminent false flag.
[03:24:17.602 --> 03:24:20.143]  Yeah, he gets that I set a false flag against the media.
[03:24:20.363 --> 03:24:22.463]  The last thing I want is for the media to be attacked.
[03:24:22.704 --> 03:24:23.284]  These villains.
[03:24:23.504 --> 03:24:25.444]  Instead they go, oh God, he's saying we're going to be attacked.
[03:24:25.464 --> 03:24:25.784]  What do we do?
[03:24:26.165 --> 03:24:27.125]  Just say he attacked us.
[03:24:27.745 --> 03:24:29.066]  I mean, Roger, that's bold, brother.
[03:24:29.546 --> 03:24:33.708]  Well, the worst thing about the late night comics is that they're not funny.
[03:24:33.728 --> 03:24:37.330]  I mean, Stephen Colbert used to be pretty funny when he was on the Colbert Report.
[03:24:37.370 --> 03:24:38.691]  Now, he's not funny.
[03:24:38.711 --> 03:24:39.972]  He's not even entertaining.
[03:24:40.452 --> 03:24:42.033]  Because it's so one-sided.
[03:24:42.053 --> 03:24:43.974]  Oh, he says I'm in the KKK last week.
[03:24:44.574 --> 03:24:45.895]  Well, that's actionable.
[03:24:47.055 --> 03:24:48.696]  Yeah, but I'm not made out of money here.
[03:24:48.716 --> 03:24:49.897]  I can barely run this operation.
[03:24:49.937 --> 03:24:52.598]  You know how these big companies are trying to lure me into suits.
[03:24:53.959 --> 03:24:56.961]  We know that, and I agree, I'm going to have to sue some of them at some point because
[03:24:58.951 --> 03:25:19.060]  I don't know the whole KKK story, but I've literally seen my grandmother, God rest her soul, dead for 12 years, called an N-word lover because my grandfather came back from World War II, became a Republican when there were no Republicans in Texas, ran for county tax assessor and stuff, you know, as a Eisenhower Republican won, and all the black folks loved him.
[03:25:19.320 --> 03:25:22.922]  All the poor whites loved him because he didn't charge property taxes for the poor.
[03:25:23.522 --> 03:25:27.386]  He would go knock on rich people's door and say, you're not going to make that old widow over there pay the property tax.
[03:25:27.406 --> 03:25:28.287]  We're going to raise yours a little bit.
[03:25:28.307 --> 03:25:29.088]  You're going to do that, aren't you?
[03:25:29.368 --> 03:25:30.870]  He was such a good guy, Jerry Jones.
[03:25:31.430 --> 03:25:32.652]  I have literally seen my grandmother.
[03:25:33.985 --> 03:25:43.895]  Not once but twice called a traitor and an N-word lover by the KKK in a grocery store and a Dairy Queen for standing up for blacks and standing up against the KKK.
[03:25:44.135 --> 03:25:49.200]  And I get to have that son of a bitch, Stephen Colbert, say I'm in the freaking KKK.
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:50.721]  That's what I'm sick of, man!
[03:25:50.741 --> 03:25:51.522]  Asshole!
[03:25:51.542 --> 03:25:52.223]  Delay that too.
[03:25:55.305 --> 03:25:56.586]  I've had the same experience.
[03:25:56.906 --> 03:26:13.150]  When I was in my pre-teens, I don't know, eight, nine years old, I was in the backseat of the car and I used the N-word and my father smacked me across the face so hard it knocked me on the floor of the car and he said, don't let me ever hear you use language against that.
[03:26:13.450 --> 03:26:17.171]  You treat everybody well regardless of their... don't ever let me hear you say that again.
[03:26:17.411 --> 03:26:18.711]  That's how I was raised.
[03:26:18.731 --> 03:26:21.872]  Because we're not trash that put other people down to feel big.
[03:26:23.290 --> 03:26:29.071]  And then these assassins of truth say, I'm in the KKK.
[03:26:29.591 --> 03:26:33.612]  It's you the Democrats that love the KKK, you pieces of trash!
[03:26:34.012 --> 03:26:34.692]  Go to hell!
[03:26:35.272 --> 03:26:36.153]  It's a caricature.
[03:26:36.713 --> 03:26:43.534]  I just pray that God, I don't want any violence towards anybody, but I think God's going to bring justice on Lester Holt and the New York Times and George Soros.
[03:26:43.554 --> 03:26:45.894]  Seriously, I believe in God and I believe in justice.
[03:26:45.994 --> 03:26:48.435]  I am sick of your Nazi collaborator lies.
[03:26:49.375 --> 03:26:51.096]  We have no choice but to fight back.
[03:26:51.136 --> 03:26:52.117]  Let me fix this for you.
[03:26:52.697 --> 03:27:01.924]  Folks, if you're an attorney out there and you're willing to represent Alex Jones pro bono, and you want to help us with this fight against censorship, contact me at Stone at StoneZone.com.
[03:27:01.984 --> 03:27:02.684]  Stone at StoneZone.com.
[03:27:02.704 --> 03:27:02.924]  No, I agree.
[03:27:03.004 --> 03:27:11.350]  Any top lawyers that want to line up to file lawsuits against everybody, because I'm defending my own, if you want to do it pro bono, and you know, for the results, I'm ready to sign on, depose, I'm ready for war.
[03:27:11.430 --> 03:27:18.655]  I want, I gotta sue Holt, I gotta sue Tom Brokaw, I gotta, called me a total Nazi, I've got to start suing these people, man.
[03:27:19.397 --> 03:27:21.393]  Because they are just sacks of garbage.
[03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:24.842]  Yeah, I think it is one of the fronts.
[03:27:24.902 --> 03:27:27.083]  Look, this has to be fought on multiple fronts.
[03:27:27.564 --> 03:27:31.146]  First of all, we're fighting it right here at InfoWars, and we're not going to throw in the towel.
[03:27:31.527 --> 03:27:36.090]  And let's face it, we are bigger and stronger and wider than ever before.
[03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:48.800]  This week, if people don't forget, if people keep spreading the word, and here's the verboten info, and here's the free app, and here's StoneColdTruth.com, and here's NewsWars.com, if you buy the products, and if you spread the word, yes, we'll be okay, even though we're under literal attack.
[03:27:48.840 --> 03:27:50.201]  And I'm not bitching, I asked for the fight.
[03:27:50.421 --> 03:27:51.942]  But now that we're such the heart of the fight,
[03:27:52.242 --> 03:27:53.863]  I'm like, we really gotta win this, Roger!
[03:27:54.103 --> 03:27:55.864]  But it's up to us to keep reminding people.
[03:27:55.924 --> 03:27:58.245]  Secondarily, yes, you need to take to the streets.
[03:27:58.745 --> 03:28:00.026]  Peaceful protest.
[03:28:00.406 --> 03:28:01.146]  Notice what I said.
[03:28:01.546 --> 03:28:02.087]  Peaceful protest.
[03:28:02.107 --> 03:28:04.508]  Lesser Hope will say you should blow up the Capitol tomorrow.
[03:28:04.548 --> 03:28:07.349]  No, no, he'll just say Stone advocates violent protest.
[03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:08.610]  Peaceful protest.
[03:28:09.651 --> 03:28:10.972]  Contact your congressman.
[03:28:11.433 --> 03:28:12.754]  This is absolutely key.
[03:28:13.275 --> 03:28:20.303]  The Congress is slow to figure this thing out, but they will be, the Republicans in Congress will reap what they sow here.
[03:28:20.704 --> 03:28:22.926]  They're trying to censor them as well.
[03:28:23.086 --> 03:28:29.114]  Contact your congressman and tell him you don't want internet censorship and point out what's being done to InfoWars.
[03:28:29.634 --> 03:28:31.195]  And then, contact the White House.
[03:28:31.255 --> 03:28:38.178]  By the way, that video was a message to Trump to stop Internet censorship, the one they claimed I wanted to attack the media, where I said, don't attack the media.
[03:28:38.538 --> 03:28:47.682]  They're really scared of us lobbying for that, because they know they're close into the election, two and a half months, they're engaged in fraud, they're engaged in election fraud, election meddling, they don't know what to do.
[03:28:47.702 --> 03:28:55.166]  We're going to come back with the bombshell news with Roger Stone that will absolutely blow away Emma Broza and all of her garbage.
[03:28:59.781 --> 03:29:02.923]  The President of the United States is racist.
[03:29:03.604 --> 03:29:04.344]  He's a punk.
[03:29:05.325 --> 03:29:06.085]  He's a dog.
[03:29:06.886 --> 03:29:07.566]  He's a pig.
[03:29:07.746 --> 03:29:11.909]  And he can suck my f**king d**k. He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[03:29:12.069 --> 03:29:16.532]  Here's my motherf**king attitude, b**ch, punk, d**k sucker.
[03:29:16.572 --> 03:29:18.013]  The President of the United States
[03:29:18.954 --> 03:29:22.439]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[03:29:22.559 --> 03:29:28.127]  In my book, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage, he's unfit to be human.
[03:29:28.147 --> 03:29:28.767]  This is CNN.
[03:29:39.960 --> 03:29:43.945]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[03:29:44.005 --> 03:29:48.151]  Donald J. Trump is President of the United States.
[03:30:02.540 --> 03:30:03.861]  The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:30:03.941 --> 03:30:05.221]  I just read it a few weeks ago.
[03:30:05.722 --> 03:30:08.823]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the bravest preachers in the world.
[03:30:09.283 --> 03:30:12.265]  Of course, he's an American, but he grew up in South Africa.
[03:30:12.285 --> 03:30:14.666]  And we're just really, really pleased to have him.
[03:30:14.686 --> 03:30:16.687]  The demise of the United States of America.
[03:30:16.727 --> 03:30:18.348]  Now, he gave us 500 books.
[03:30:18.408 --> 03:30:19.368]  I've ordered 1,000 more.
[03:30:19.388 --> 03:30:20.169]  They're coming in next week.
[03:30:20.209 --> 03:30:21.910]  It starts shipping next Tuesday.
[03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:27.793]  But he does have audiobooks on CD and Audible.com that also start coming out next week.
[03:30:27.813 --> 03:30:28.713]  So we'll be selling those.
[03:30:28.733 --> 03:30:32.135]  But I don't care where you get them, just be sure and
[03:30:32.535 --> 03:30:32.935]  Get them.
[03:30:33.235 --> 03:30:39.158]  I feel in my gut, but also historically, and you see this biblically, God gives people one last chance, and to turn it around.
[03:30:39.178 --> 03:30:42.820]  So people think, oh, it's Providence, he's divinely inspired, you know, he can't be stopped.
[03:30:42.900 --> 03:30:43.500]  I don't agree with that.
[03:30:43.520 --> 03:30:50.804]  I think if we don't back Trump, if we aren't strong, if we don't pray, if we're not active, if we're not courageous, I think God will step aside and let this whole thing fall.
[03:30:51.024 --> 03:30:52.466]  This is a last minute reprieve.
[03:30:52.506 --> 03:30:58.932]  In actual fact, Dr. Paul Williams, when we were writing this, he said, I want the last chapter to be called the reign of Jezebel.
[03:30:59.293 --> 03:31:01.635]  And I looked at him and said, absolutely not.
[03:31:02.195 --> 03:31:02.896]  Absolutely not.
[03:31:02.956 --> 03:31:03.877]  She's not getting in.
[03:31:04.238 --> 03:31:06.920]  He said, she, she, there's no way she's not going to win.
[03:31:07.281 --> 03:31:09.303]  I said, she is not going to get in.
[03:31:09.683 --> 03:31:13.327]  We've had all night premiums at the church, you know, and I didn't support Trump.
[03:31:13.387 --> 03:31:14.268]  I knew Trump was going to win.
[03:31:14.508 --> 03:31:19.169]  Yeah, I didn't support him as a Republican or Democrat because both Republican and Democrat are wicked.
[03:31:19.269 --> 03:31:23.971]  I supported him because he was an outsider and was not funded by the globalists to come.
[03:31:24.091 --> 03:31:27.472]  And you could see that genuinely the globalists hate him.
[03:31:27.512 --> 03:31:27.872]  In a way.
[03:31:28.092 --> 03:31:29.252]  The Pope is against him.
[03:31:29.632 --> 03:31:32.273]  The world's financial elite in Davos is against him.
[03:31:32.613 --> 03:31:33.914]  The former Mexican...
[03:31:35.254 --> 03:31:37.716]  You know, president is against him, everybody.
[03:31:37.736 --> 03:31:41.018]  I said, okay, well that tells you who he's supposed to support right there.
[03:31:41.098 --> 03:31:43.140]  And I feel that we've got this window.
[03:31:43.500 --> 03:31:45.742]  God has granted us a last minute reprieve.
[03:31:46.042 --> 03:31:46.903]  It's not over yet.
[03:31:47.083 --> 03:31:50.666]  Let me tell you, back in 07, I said to the Lord, tell me, is it too late?
[03:31:51.266 --> 03:31:52.887]  I mean, it's 07, 08, is it too late?
[03:31:53.207 --> 03:31:55.109]  I'll tell the people, because I'm not going to lie to them.
[03:31:55.149 --> 03:31:57.050]  I'll tell them, hey, it's over.
[03:31:57.471 --> 03:32:04.056]  And put yourself in the brace position, like they tell you on the aircraft, which is not a good thing, because that means you're trying to get your head as close to your butt.
[03:32:05.317 --> 03:32:06.838]  You can kiss him goodbye, you know.
[03:32:06.858 --> 03:32:08.299]  It's like, we're going down, you know.
[03:32:08.680 --> 03:32:11.082]  So, you know, the Lord said to me, it's not too late.
[03:32:11.602 --> 03:32:13.023]  And God is waiting on us.
[03:32:13.304 --> 03:32:14.545]  He's waiting on us to stand up.
[03:32:14.905 --> 03:32:18.548]  And I want to just say this, you know, I feel the Lord's hand of protection is on you.
[03:32:18.908 --> 03:32:20.770]  If they were going to take you out, they would have taken you out.
[03:32:20.790 --> 03:32:21.771]  They're not going to touch you.
[03:32:22.091 --> 03:32:28.394]  Because of the blood of Jesus that protects you, the angels of God that encamp about you, your wife, your children, and everything that you touch.
[03:32:28.635 --> 03:32:30.295]  So don't, don't get frustrated.
[03:32:30.336 --> 03:32:32.337]  Know that the Lord, there's a God in heaven.
[03:32:32.657 --> 03:32:33.977]  And you know, He's about you.
[03:32:33.997 --> 03:32:35.838]  He said, I'll be about you as a wall of fire.
[03:32:35.878 --> 03:32:36.559]  He told me that.
[03:32:36.639 --> 03:32:36.959]  I feel it.
[03:32:36.979 --> 03:32:38.620]  I just don't feel like I'm doing good enough.
[03:32:38.760 --> 03:32:39.100]  No, no.
[03:32:39.420 --> 03:32:40.520]  Alex, it's not about that.
[03:32:40.540 --> 03:32:41.380]  You're doing your best.
[03:32:41.681 --> 03:32:42.241]  Here's the thing.
[03:32:42.341 --> 03:32:43.941]  Everybody must do what they can.
[03:32:44.181 --> 03:32:45.561]  Everybody does their best.
[03:32:45.861 --> 03:32:48.982]  And at the end of the day, God takes our best and he multiplies it.
[03:32:49.002 --> 03:32:49.142]  I know.
[03:32:49.202 --> 03:32:50.202]  I can feel God's strength.
[03:32:50.482 --> 03:32:52.382]  I just can't believe that other people don't see it.
[03:32:52.582 --> 03:32:57.683]  Yeah, but that's why I'm going to preach the gospel to them so that they can experience the power of the Holy Spirit.
[03:33:03.324 --> 03:33:05.965]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:19.614]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.408 --> 03:33:41.230]  Roger Stone is here, former head of the Trump campaign, 40-plus year friend of the President, wingman.
[03:33:41.250 --> 03:33:49.514]  And I read a bunch of articles in the New York Times, which I don't believe at face value, but in the old days it was more accurate, especially about social stuff in New York.
[03:33:50.294 --> 03:33:52.015]  And Roger was telling me about
[03:33:53.195 --> 03:33:56.057]  You know, some of the things that were true, some of the things that weren't true.
[03:33:56.077 --> 03:34:00.741]  You know, I would ask him about his lawyer, who was the famous anti-communist.
[03:34:01.121 --> 03:34:01.602]  Roy Cohn.
[03:34:01.922 --> 03:34:06.746]  Roy Cohn, who helped run the whole situation for Joseph McCarthy.
[03:34:07.386 --> 03:34:09.848]  And, you know, about his dad, Fred Trump, and all of it.
[03:34:09.888 --> 03:34:11.229]  And then I got into the women thing.
[03:34:11.249 --> 03:34:12.490]  And he didn't say much.
[03:34:12.550 --> 03:34:14.151]  He said, well, this is true or that isn't true.
[03:34:14.171 --> 03:34:16.233]  And I asked, is Trump racist?
[03:34:16.733 --> 03:34:18.595]  This was like two and a half years ago, in the middle of the campaign.
[03:34:18.615 --> 03:34:20.716]  He said, no, he likes winners.
[03:34:21.197 --> 03:34:22.317]  He likes interesting people.
[03:34:23.638 --> 03:34:24.839]  And he likes people with a lot of energy.
[03:34:24.859 --> 03:34:29.701]  He is a germaphobe, but he's gotten over that.
[03:34:29.761 --> 03:34:31.361]  Later, I first learned that from you.
[03:34:31.681 --> 03:34:36.143]  You also told me how about a year before he ever ran, he went to Scotland for months to decide he wasn't going to run.
[03:34:36.163 --> 03:34:40.465]  Then Melania asked him, too, so you had all the inside baseball, so I guess you were the one that finally got him to run.
[03:34:40.965 --> 03:34:45.246]  And then later, you know, he moved on because you might have had some baggage, like we all do.
[03:34:45.607 --> 03:34:47.027]  So just talk about Trump himself.
[03:34:47.167 --> 03:34:51.309]  And then this is something you told me months ago and a year ago you didn't want to bring out.
[03:34:52.028 --> 03:34:57.912]  But now you think if we bring it out to a certain point, it's something that Trump won't get upset about.
[03:34:58.232 --> 03:35:04.096]  But this is the first time that something's in confidence with you and Trump, but it's only because of this Amorosa BS.
[03:35:04.756 --> 03:35:06.917]  This is big world exclusive right now.
[03:35:06.957 --> 03:35:08.699]  So tell it however you want to tell it.
[03:35:08.719 --> 03:35:13.401]  We'll put some of the images of this beautiful lady up here when he was in between marriages.
[03:35:13.842 --> 03:35:18.425]  Look, I really find the charge that Donald Trump is a racist to be outrageous.
[03:35:19.005 --> 03:35:21.027]  I mean, I've known him 40 years now.
[03:35:21.587 --> 03:35:23.729]  I've never heard him use the N-word.
[03:35:23.909 --> 03:35:27.072]  I've never heard him say anything disparaging about blacks.
[03:35:27.793 --> 03:35:36.200]  And when I was around him in the 80s and 90s for an enormous amount of time, both Jesse Jackson and the Reverend Al Sharpton were good friends of his.
[03:35:36.240 --> 03:35:37.922]  You said you had dinner with him all the time?
[03:35:38.022 --> 03:35:39.483]  He had dinner with Sharpton.
[03:35:39.523 --> 03:35:40.864]  He liked both of them.
[03:35:40.964 --> 03:35:43.166]  He liked their cause more than ever.
[03:35:44.147 --> 03:35:59.239]  Between 1999 and 2001, after he divorced Marla Maples in June of 1999, he started dating a bevy of some of the most beautiful supermodels on the face of the earth.
[03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:12.995]  But a real favorite of his, and I think really by 2001 he was only dating two women, the one he would ultimately marry, Melania, who I think is a wonderful woman, and also a model named Cara Young.
[03:36:13.055 --> 03:36:15.257]  Cara Young is African-American.
[03:36:15.277 --> 03:36:16.259]  There you see her.
[03:36:17.120 --> 03:36:18.661]  This is an incredible story.
[03:36:19.042 --> 03:36:20.443]  This is a woman who literally
[03:36:21.164 --> 03:36:26.368]  She looks a lot like Melania.
[03:36:26.968 --> 03:36:28.209]  She's absolutely beautiful.
[03:36:28.329 --> 03:36:29.450]  She is cultured.
[03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:30.971]  She is decent.
[03:36:31.171 --> 03:36:32.172]  She is thoughtful.
[03:36:32.412 --> 03:36:33.353]  She is kind.
[03:36:33.913 --> 03:36:34.754]  And she is black.
[03:36:35.354 --> 03:36:39.277]  Now, if Donald Trump were a racist, why would he be dating a black woman?
[03:36:39.417 --> 03:36:41.339]  I think he really loved Cara Young.
[03:36:41.679 --> 03:36:42.480]  I think he was really torn.
[03:36:44.361 --> 03:36:48.262]  I'm not saying he didn't make the right decision, because I think so highly of Melania.
[03:36:48.643 --> 03:36:50.243]  But I think this is... Well, tell the whole story.
[03:36:50.263 --> 03:36:51.064]  He asked Donald Trump Jr.
[03:36:51.084 --> 03:36:51.824]  who he should pick.
[03:36:51.884 --> 03:36:57.386]  Well, I was on the plane with him once... Alright, folks, you're getting world exclusive right now.
[03:36:57.746 --> 03:37:02.428]  I was on the plane with him, and he was talking to Eric Trump, actually.
[03:37:02.448 --> 03:37:03.108]  Oh, Eric Trump, okay.
[03:37:03.748 --> 03:37:11.691]  And he was dating both Melania and Cara Young, and he said, you know, they're both beautiful, they're both great, I love them both, I just can't decide what to do.
[03:37:12.331 --> 03:37:13.392]  And Eric said, Dad...
[03:37:14.333 --> 03:37:16.280]  Kara is mistress material.
[03:37:16.681 --> 03:37:18.849]  Melania is wife material.
[03:37:19.867 --> 03:37:22.129]  And that ended up being the advice that he took.
[03:37:22.189 --> 03:37:31.695]  But the idea that he's a racist, if he's a racist, Omarosa, why would he be dating this beautiful black woman who I think he really loved and may still love today as a friend?
[03:37:32.235 --> 03:37:37.479]  So I think it explodes the entire myth that Donald Trump is a racist.
[03:37:37.559 --> 03:37:38.159]  It's false.
[03:37:38.760 --> 03:37:41.662]  I've hung out with him in many situations.
[03:37:41.762 --> 03:37:43.543]  I've never heard him say anything racist.
[03:37:43.563 --> 03:37:45.484]  Well, why is he in more rap videos than anybody else?
[03:37:45.524 --> 03:37:47.626]  Because he's the guy that opened up 40 something years ago.
[03:37:47.646 --> 03:37:49.227]  I can't believe this was even happening.
[03:37:50.027 --> 03:37:53.268]  That shows I was born after that, 45 years ago.
[03:37:53.288 --> 03:37:56.389]  They had anti-black, anti-Jew golf courses.
[03:37:56.429 --> 03:37:58.110]  He bought all those up, opened them up.
[03:37:58.470 --> 03:37:59.430]  He loves everybody.
[03:37:59.731 --> 03:38:00.651]  And we're not just saying that.
[03:38:01.311 --> 03:38:01.711]  It's the truth.
[03:38:01.731 --> 03:38:03.052]  Because I interrogated years ago.
[03:38:03.132 --> 03:38:04.992]  I said, is it true they say he's racist?
[03:38:05.012 --> 03:38:05.933]  You're like, absolutely not.
[03:38:06.333 --> 03:38:06.973]  It's not going on.
[03:38:06.993 --> 03:38:08.193]  There's even more you could tell.
[03:38:09.154 --> 03:38:11.735]  But it just shows how insane all this is.
[03:38:11.775 --> 03:38:15.016]  And she says he never said anything racist to her in the years they were together.
[03:38:15.663 --> 03:38:19.666]  Yeah, so what's interesting, of course, is that Omarosa totally changed her story here.
[03:38:20.187 --> 03:38:29.254]  So, during the campaign, she'd never heard Trump say the N-word, she absolutely denied he was a racist, and then when she got fired, she changed her story.
[03:38:29.474 --> 03:38:29.935]  Overnight.
[03:38:30.075 --> 03:38:31.155]  On the basis of nothing.
[03:38:31.196 --> 03:38:35.819]  No corroboration, no secondary witnesses, nobody else heard this, only she heard it.
[03:38:36.220 --> 03:38:36.940]  It's nonsense.
[03:38:37.701 --> 03:38:38.601]  And you're absolutely right.
[03:38:38.802 --> 03:38:39.822]  So, in Palm Beach,
[03:38:40.603 --> 03:38:45.566]  He bought the Meriwether Post Pavilion Mansion, Mar-a-Lago, from the U.S.
[03:38:45.626 --> 03:38:46.967]  government in a fire sale.
[03:38:47.288 --> 03:38:48.929]  It had been closed up for 15 years.
[03:38:49.029 --> 03:38:50.290]  It was ramshackle.
[03:38:51.450 --> 03:38:55.193]  To me, it looked like a teardown, but that shows you how little I know about real estate.
[03:38:55.573 --> 03:39:00.857]  Because Trump is a visionary, he looked at the place and said, wow, this could be incredible.
[03:39:00.877 --> 03:39:04.059]  And that's kind of how they say he sees America.
[03:39:04.559 --> 03:39:06.180]  Yeah, he's a visionary.
[03:39:06.560 --> 03:39:07.421]  I've seen this twice.
[03:39:07.541 --> 03:39:10.063]  I saw the same thing when he bought the Doral Golf Club.
[03:39:10.943 --> 03:39:11.843]  He said he got obsessed with it.
[03:39:11.863 --> 03:39:17.065]  He had big penthouses in New York, but he moved down to a small apartment for years just to rebuild this whole building.
[03:39:17.685 --> 03:39:18.185]  He loved it.
[03:39:18.385 --> 03:39:20.526]  Yeah, no, he loves architecture and he loves building.
[03:39:20.566 --> 03:39:21.706]  Building is his passion.
[03:39:22.947 --> 03:39:23.667]  Not politics.
[03:39:23.787 --> 03:39:24.147]  Building.
[03:39:25.247 --> 03:39:30.529]  But in this case, he noticed that the two most prominent private clubs in Palm Beach
[03:39:31.249 --> 03:39:40.837]  The Bath and Tennis, and I think the Palm Beach Club, do not admit Jews, do not admit blacks, do not admit Hispanics, and there's not too many Catholics involved.
[03:39:41.337 --> 03:39:47.903]  So he decided to convert this palatial home of his into a private club in which there were no racial restrictions.
[03:39:47.983 --> 03:39:50.145]  If you had the money, you could join.
[03:39:50.785 --> 03:39:52.427]  That's what a big racist he is.
[03:39:53.348 --> 03:39:54.829]  So this charge is false.
[03:39:54.850 --> 03:39:56.031]  But he did that other places too.
[03:39:56.051 --> 03:39:56.992]  He was known for that.
[03:39:57.052 --> 03:39:59.935]  He did it in the golf club in Miami.
[03:40:00.015 --> 03:40:03.539]  This is a guy who is adamantly opposed to prejudice and bigotry.
[03:40:03.579 --> 03:40:08.024]  This idea that he's a racist is a false narrative of the left and it has no basis.
[03:40:08.064 --> 03:40:08.985]  We all know that.
[03:40:09.225 --> 03:40:11.667]  It's the point that Amorosa begged for this job.
[03:40:12.048 --> 03:40:18.474]  She came in and then now it's all been discredited and they've got these edited tapes and now they admit there is no n-word tape.
[03:40:18.854 --> 03:40:23.018]  They're floating this to try to keep the black and Hispanic vote from putting us over the top in 2018.
[03:40:25.138 --> 03:40:35.443]  Look, Amorosa attacked me by name last night saying that Donald Trump knew in advance about the WikiLeaks publication of the DNC emails.
[03:40:36.084 --> 03:40:41.486]  And then she goes on to say, and they're investigating Roger Stone and they should because he's one of the shady characters around Trump.
[03:40:42.046 --> 03:40:43.807]  Will you talk about shady, Amorosa?
[03:40:43.987 --> 03:40:45.268]  Please, look in the mirror.
[03:40:45.288 --> 03:40:46.949]  It doesn't get any shadier than that.
[03:40:47.569 --> 03:40:59.576]  You're convincing the administration to send a delegation for the inauguration of the corrupt Haitian regime that works with the Bushes and the Clintons to rip off all of the earthquake money and leave the people in Haiti.
[03:40:59.716 --> 03:41:01.337]  And the Haitians hate Amoroso.
[03:41:01.357 --> 03:41:04.458]  When he was about to appoint her, you were on the air, like, don't do it.
[03:41:04.518 --> 03:41:06.940]  I was like, why are you obsessing on this Amoroso lady?
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:08.460]  I was kind of like, knock it off, who cares?
[03:41:08.781 --> 03:41:09.221]  You were right.
[03:41:09.821 --> 03:41:13.024]  No, she did the country and the administration a disservice.
[03:41:13.965 --> 03:41:26.897]  Zeldanto has been on Infowars with us several times, the most knowledgeable person I know on this subject, about the rape of Haiti, about the way the Clintons raped Haiti, and Omarosa helped them do that.
[03:41:27.257 --> 03:41:28.298]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[03:41:28.358 --> 03:41:31.781]  We just brought out Trump's long-time beautiful
[03:41:33.396 --> 03:41:38.902]  The New York Times said 30 years ago you were his wingman, so when he was in between marriages, you guys would go out and double-deck.
[03:41:49.232 --> 03:41:50.394]  There's no question about that.
[03:41:50.474 --> 03:41:50.954]  I admit it.
[03:41:51.295 --> 03:41:52.516]  And I met her and I liked her.
[03:41:52.616 --> 03:41:55.440]  I also went on dates where Melania was present.
[03:41:55.500 --> 03:41:56.722]  And I like her as well.
[03:41:56.862 --> 03:41:58.284]  Well, Melania's intimidating.
[03:41:58.304 --> 03:41:59.345]  I mean, I've only met her once.
[03:41:59.405 --> 03:42:00.126]  It's like, whoa!
[03:42:00.286 --> 03:42:00.687]  Smart.
[03:42:01.007 --> 03:42:02.369]  Really, really smart.
[03:42:02.489 --> 03:42:04.852]  Cultured, smart, kind.
[03:42:05.052 --> 03:42:05.753]  Kind of low-key.
[03:42:07.034 --> 03:42:10.215]  Kara Young is more bubbly, more bubbly personality.
[03:42:10.776 --> 03:42:14.377]  But if he's a racist, why would he be dating a black woman?
[03:42:14.597 --> 03:42:15.778]  He's not a racist, folks.
[03:42:16.158 --> 03:42:17.078]  He loves everybody.
[03:42:17.358 --> 03:42:18.439]  And he would like to see everybody succeed.
[03:42:18.459 --> 03:42:19.639]  But he likes that Melania-looking type.
[03:42:19.679 --> 03:42:20.640]  She looks a lot like Melania.
[03:42:20.660 --> 03:42:22.380]  Yeah, they do look similar in a way.
[03:42:22.400 --> 03:42:23.821]  I hadn't noticed that previously.
[03:42:24.621 --> 03:42:27.462]  But this story had to be told, finally.
[03:42:28.082 --> 03:42:30.283]  And I don't think there's anything to be embarrassed about.
[03:42:30.303 --> 03:42:30.803]  Stormy Daniels, though?
[03:42:30.823 --> 03:42:31.864]  Man, she is gross.
[03:42:34.068 --> 03:42:34.768]  Who knows?
[03:42:36.169 --> 03:42:39.750]  I have no idea about Stormy Daniels.
[03:42:39.830 --> 03:42:41.510]  I never double dated with Stormy Daniels.
[03:42:41.530 --> 03:42:45.591]  Stormy Daniels looks like a walrus that ate 55,000 cans of Crisco.
[03:42:46.531 --> 03:42:46.871]  Today.
[03:42:48.312 --> 03:42:48.952]  We'll be back.
[03:42:49.032 --> 03:42:52.413]  I want to talk about the big news when we return.
[03:42:52.453 --> 03:42:54.633]  Trump's revoking the security clearances, finally.
[03:42:55.114 --> 03:42:56.034]  InfoWars.com.

[03:42:59.775 --> 03:43:00.075]  Now!
[03:43:02.244 --> 03:43:03.605]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:43:05.206 --> 03:43:07.307]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:43:07.568 --> 03:43:08.628]  I believe in you!
[03:43:09.069 --> 03:43:10.189]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:43:12.011 --> 03:43:14.853]  One man ever raped a woman!
[03:43:15.193 --> 03:43:16.814]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:43:17.034 --> 03:43:19.456]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:43:19.596 --> 03:43:20.797]  And we're not backing down, ever!
[03:43:20.817 --> 03:43:23.879]  I wanna kick these people!
[03:43:23.919 --> 03:43:24.439]  We're winning!
[03:43:24.499 --> 03:43:25.580]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:25.740 --> 03:43:26.200]  Can't you?
[03:43:26.501 --> 03:43:28.142]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:28.502 --> 03:43:29.623]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:33.484 --> 03:43:33.864]  Let's go!
[03:43:33.884 --> 03:43:34.125]  Come on!
[03:43:34.145 --> 03:43:34.465]  Come on!
[03:43:34.485 --> 03:43:35.225]  Come on!
[03:43:35.405 --> 03:43:35.826]  Come on!
[03:43:35.846 --> 03:43:36.006]  Come on!
[03:43:36.026 --> 03:43:36.326]  Come on!
[03:43:36.346 --> 03:43:36.586]  Come on!
[03:43:36.646 --> 03:43:36.966]  Come on!
[03:43:36.987 --> 03:43:37.207]  Come on!
[03:43:37.287 --> 03:43:37.607]  Come on!
[03:43:37.627 --> 03:43:37.847]  Come on!

[03:43:59.662 --> 03:44:02.863]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:03.323 --> 03:44:04.623]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:44:05.123 --> 03:44:16.646]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:44:17.346 --> 03:44:22.427]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[03:44:22.807 --> 03:44:26.251]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:44:26.671 --> 03:44:32.518]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:44:32.738 --> 03:44:37.363]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:44:37.884 --> 03:44:40.206]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:44:40.546 --> 03:44:41.887]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:44:42.287 --> 03:44:51.895]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:44:51.995 --> 03:44:54.157]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:44:54.677 --> 03:44:59.561]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:45:11.917 --> 03:45:13.498]  The circle is now complete.
[03:45:13.958 --> 03:45:15.959]  When I left you, I was but a learner.
[03:45:16.099 --> 03:45:17.921]  Now I am the master.
[03:45:18.621 --> 03:45:20.342]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[03:45:23.844 --> 03:45:25.885]  Your powers are weak, old man.
[03:45:26.786 --> 03:45:27.986]  You can't win, Darth.
[03:45:28.747 --> 03:45:33.870]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[03:45:43.258 --> 03:45:47.000]  No!
[03:45:47.980 --> 03:46:08.030]  We are number one trending app in news.
[03:46:08.270 --> 03:46:09.191]  Number one
[03:46:10.862 --> 03:46:11.202]  Trending.
[03:46:11.683 --> 03:46:13.464]  Click on that for a larger image, please.
[03:46:14.345 --> 03:46:16.247]  Number one trending.
[03:46:16.667 --> 03:46:17.268]  Guess what we are?
[03:46:17.288 --> 03:46:17.788]  Total.
[03:46:17.988 --> 03:46:28.698]  Out of thousands of news apps, we are number three total in the world, surpassing CNN and Fox News.
[03:46:28.758 --> 03:46:32.622]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:46:32.762 --> 03:46:36.245]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official
[03:46:36.785 --> 03:46:39.667]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.570 --> 03:47:17.690]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:18.170 --> 03:47:29.313]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.333 --> 03:47:34.554]  Look, they think you're unconscious, they think you're stupid, they think you have no memory, they think you have no soul like they do.
[03:47:36.294 --> 03:47:42.795]  Lester Holt and the New York Times and George Soros and all the rest of them put out reports saying I'm saying attack the media with no proof.
[03:47:43.436 --> 03:47:45.056]  We're going to put a video up in the next hour.
[03:47:48.837 --> 03:47:49.457]  I'm gonna say that right now.
[03:47:51.239 --> 03:47:52.219]  Hell's gonna break loose.
[03:47:52.260 --> 03:47:53.681]  That camera isn't even angled right.
[03:47:54.421 --> 03:48:00.926]  And we're going to sit there and we're gonna put out the truth about what I've really said and what I've really done.
[03:48:02.527 --> 03:48:14.235]  And I hope the listeners get the video from our own platform and post it on Twitter and YouTube everywhere and jam it in their mouth because they're using this lie about me to deplatform us completely and come after everybody else.
[03:48:14.275 --> 03:48:15.977]  So it is absolutely critical
[03:48:17.008 --> 03:48:18.188]  That information comes out.
[03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:19.649]  Camera 2, please.
[03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:23.471]  Now, Roger, let's spend this time plugging.
[03:48:24.911 --> 03:48:27.652]  We're in a total war against criminal media and the globalists.
[03:48:27.732 --> 03:48:28.953]  We need financial support.
[03:48:29.473 --> 03:48:33.275]  And I've told you, I don't want to just do little fundraisers where you mention fundraise here, fundraise there.
[03:48:33.675 --> 03:48:36.916]  I want folks to know you're being sued by Obama, sued by the Democrats.
[03:48:36.936 --> 03:48:38.117]  They're trying to shut you down.
[03:48:38.577 --> 03:48:39.977]  They're absolutely on your ass.
[03:48:40.918 --> 03:48:42.919]  It's critical that people support you.
[03:48:42.959 --> 03:48:43.779]  They can buy your book.
[03:48:45.276 --> 03:48:46.097]  Stones Rules!
[03:49:16.077 --> 03:49:17.238]  I've been asking for a week and a half.
[03:49:17.278 --> 03:49:18.459]  When I get off the show, I'm going to do it.
[03:49:18.960 --> 03:49:33.275]  A new page every day that isn't just on the demand, but it's going to be a page that says, here are the forbidden videos of the day on our own server so they can't stop them getting out so you can go there and get them and put them on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[03:49:33.335 --> 03:49:35.116]  That is the total war.
[03:49:35.697 --> 03:49:37.058]  They're trying to silence us.
[03:49:37.098 --> 03:49:39.480]  It's more important than getting the free Apple on Apple.
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:44.043]  It's more important than getting the free, you know, all that crap.
[03:49:44.063 --> 03:49:44.743]  They can turn it off.
[03:49:45.144 --> 03:49:46.805]  Sign up for our own free newsletter.
[03:49:46.845 --> 03:49:48.346]  Infowars.com.
[03:49:48.566 --> 03:49:50.007]  They shut us down yesterday.
[03:49:50.508 --> 03:49:53.189]  They're trying to take our Akamai thing we've had for five, six years.
[03:49:53.229 --> 03:49:55.491]  We paid millions of dollars to pay for our own streams.
[03:49:55.731 --> 03:49:56.832]  They're sabotaging us.
[03:49:56.852 --> 03:50:00.234]  They're making a move and it signifies something big is coming.
[03:50:01.678 --> 03:50:02.598]  I appreciate your help.
[03:50:02.778 --> 03:50:03.758]  I appreciate your support.
[03:50:03.778 --> 03:50:04.799]  But this isn't a video game.
[03:50:04.819 --> 03:50:05.639]  This is the real world.
[03:50:05.679 --> 03:50:06.999]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:50:33.129 --> 03:50:37.693]  But if you look at the amount of money we didn't bring in under Shadowbanning last year, we haven't caught back up.
[03:50:37.733 --> 03:50:38.734]  They took our Credio.
[03:50:39.195 --> 03:50:43.979]  They took our sponsorship with AdRoll a year and a half ago that cost us $3.5 million.
[03:50:44.759 --> 03:50:45.680]  That's our funding money.
[03:50:46.101 --> 03:50:48.002]  Then now Credio, we almost brought that in.
[03:50:48.022 --> 03:50:49.183]  They took that away as well.
[03:50:50.137 --> 03:50:51.958]  And I'm not sure bitching.
[03:50:51.978 --> 03:50:53.118]  I'm not saying, oh, give me more money.
[03:50:53.439 --> 03:50:56.540]  If you want to win and beat these people, InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:50:56.620 --> 03:50:57.380]  It's that simple.
[03:50:57.560 --> 03:51:00.001]  They're totally adverse on every damn TV channel.
[03:51:00.262 --> 03:51:01.002]  Why do you think that?
[03:51:01.022 --> 03:51:02.703]  Because we got their number!
[03:51:02.903 --> 03:51:04.644]  The pedophile rings are being exposed.
[03:51:04.844 --> 03:51:06.725]  The Chi-Com control's coming out in the news.
[03:51:07.005 --> 03:51:07.905]  We're on target.
[03:51:08.065 --> 03:51:08.966]  I've done my research.
[03:51:09.006 --> 03:51:10.406]  I'm not playing games.
[03:51:10.806 --> 03:51:12.227]  I didn't fall off a turnip truck.
[03:51:12.427 --> 03:51:15.028]  My family, you know, don't sit there and, you know,
[03:51:17.350 --> 03:51:19.592]  Make McDonald's hamburgers all day, okay?
[03:51:20.073 --> 03:51:21.335]  I know what I'm talking about.
[03:51:21.775 --> 03:51:23.818]  They want me silenced, they want Roger silenced.
[03:51:24.118 --> 03:51:25.259]  Roger, how do folks support you?
[03:51:25.540 --> 03:51:26.381]  This is absolutely right.
[03:51:26.421 --> 03:51:27.502]  This is a three-step plan.
[03:51:27.522 --> 03:51:29.665]  Let's be very clear what the big coming event is.
[03:51:30.385 --> 03:51:32.308]  One, shut InfoWars down.
[03:51:32.648 --> 03:51:33.329]  Shut it down.
[03:51:33.409 --> 03:51:34.731]  Make sure you can't see it anywhere.
[03:51:35.351 --> 03:51:40.393]  2.
[03:51:35.691 --> 03:51:40.393]  Incarcerate Roger Stone on some phony trumped up charge so he cannot oppose.
[03:51:40.413 --> 03:51:40.393]  3.
[03:51:40.813 --> 03:51:46.194]  The impeachment and removal of Donald Trump under any means necessary.
[03:51:46.634 --> 03:51:48.195]  I just said it folks.
[03:51:48.215 --> 03:51:48.195]  1, 2, 3.
[03:51:49.615 --> 03:51:50.876]  Close Infowars down.
[03:51:51.156 --> 03:51:52.556]  Incarcerate Roger Stone.
[03:51:52.816 --> 03:51:54.077]  Remove the President.
[03:51:54.357 --> 03:51:57.998]  Please folks, they are... By the way, we're not just hyping that.
[03:51:58.718 --> 03:52:04.544]  They all, they say that in their own white papers, and why do they think the three of us, because I mean, I want to say we're important.
[03:52:05.846 --> 03:52:06.927]  I guess we are that important.
[03:52:06.967 --> 03:52:07.928]  What have they figured out?
[03:52:08.288 --> 03:52:09.990]  Because it is our audience that's important.
[03:52:10.370 --> 03:52:15.275]  Well, because we say what other people won't say, and that is what drives them insane.
[03:52:15.896 --> 03:52:17.978]  My legal fees are going to be $2 million.
[03:52:18.739 --> 03:52:32.711]  They are taking a parade of my current and former associates before the grand jury, asking leading questions, bullying them before the grand jury, trying to put words in their mouth, stopping them when they try to explain things on an honest basis.
[03:52:33.071 --> 03:52:35.153]  This is an abusive process.
[03:52:35.413 --> 03:52:37.796]  And they're trying to claim you're manipulating them even though you're not talking to them.
[03:52:37.836 --> 03:52:46.787]  No, they would love to be able to say that I've tampered with witnesses so they can lock me up in a box like they did Paul Manafort, except for I've been very careful to do nothing, even close.
[03:52:46.827 --> 03:52:48.729]  And I want to blow your defense fund, but let me ask this question.
[03:52:49.270 --> 03:52:53.135]  Why did they do 11 days of prosecution, half a day in defense, no defense of Manafort?
[03:52:53.375 --> 03:52:54.637]  Why did they just rest yesterday?
[03:52:55.097 --> 03:52:58.079]  You know, it's a legal tactic I really don't understand.
[03:52:58.679 --> 03:53:02.161]  They obviously think their summation is going to knock out this case.
[03:53:02.782 --> 03:53:06.124]  They're going to make the case that the government hasn't proved their case.
[03:53:06.164 --> 03:53:10.726]  They admit, even the judge says, stop talking about he bought his wife a purse and a fancy car.
[03:53:11.126 --> 03:53:11.647]  It's not illegal.
[03:53:11.667 --> 03:53:15.909]  They just kept talking about they have the shopkeepers in about how they bought the Mercedes.
[03:53:15.949 --> 03:53:16.950]  Yeah, they want to make it about
[03:53:17.851 --> 03:53:19.592]  Manafort has all this money.
[03:53:19.652 --> 03:53:26.198]  They're trying to turn the jury against him because he's successful.
[03:53:26.659 --> 03:53:28.200]  Even the judge instructed the jury.
[03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:30.482]  It is not illegal to make money in America.
[03:53:30.903 --> 03:53:31.944]  So let me ask you this question.
[03:53:32.404 --> 03:53:37.408]  Obviously, the partner that went against him got caught and busted first, so he's totally discredited.
[03:53:37.888 --> 03:53:44.934]  What type of guy, he used to be a business partner for Manafort, he always had a good name until this, and all these other globalists have offshore accounts, so why can't he?
[03:53:45.294 --> 03:53:47.476]  But I mean, what type of guy is he and why didn't he roll over?
[03:53:47.516 --> 03:53:49.958]  We know they said, hey, make stuff up on Trump, we'll do this.
[03:53:50.834 --> 03:53:52.595]  You just don't understand Paul Manafort.
[03:53:53.035 --> 03:53:55.517]  He's an Italian-American who is tough as nails.
[03:53:55.977 --> 03:53:58.798]  He was counting on another guy to run the financial end of the business.
[03:53:58.838 --> 03:54:01.480]  Paul Manafort couldn't organize... Well, say, admit that guy embezzled.
[03:54:01.760 --> 03:54:03.981]  Yeah, and he embezzled $3 million, not $400,000.
[03:54:04.061 --> 03:54:08.544]  And we now even admitted that he was stealing from the President's Inauguration Fund.
[03:54:09.024 --> 03:54:11.125]  This is the government's chief witness.
[03:54:11.145 --> 03:54:12.386]  So what type of guy is Manafort?
[03:54:12.746 --> 03:54:15.268]  Manafort is a very smart guy.
[03:54:15.708 --> 03:54:20.090]  He is a very... He's a thinker.
[03:54:20.131 --> 03:54:20.911]  He's a strategist.
[03:54:21.271 --> 03:54:23.012]  He wouldn't even know how to operate a computer.
[03:54:23.412 --> 03:54:26.034]  I don't think he knows how to operate his cell phone, to be honest with you.
[03:54:26.374 --> 03:54:28.295]  He's less technical than I am.
[03:54:28.636 --> 03:54:30.557]  He counted on Rick Gates for these things.
[03:54:31.057 --> 03:54:32.498]  And Rick Gates sold him down the river.
[03:54:32.958 --> 03:54:34.719]  So look, I'm praying for his acquittal.
[03:54:35.680 --> 03:54:39.102]  I'm not going to second-guess his legal strategy, Alex, because I don't really understand it.
[03:54:39.842 --> 03:54:41.584]  But I think we'll know something later today.
[03:54:41.604 --> 03:54:44.786]  And I'm praying to God that he gets acquitted.
[03:54:45.446 --> 03:54:47.828]  And now he's got to face a whole other series of charges.
[03:54:47.868 --> 03:54:49.249]  But let's make this point and it's key.
[03:54:49.810 --> 03:54:54.754]  Nothing he is charged with has anything to do with Donald Trump or the Trump campaign.
[03:54:55.414 --> 03:54:57.115]  They've dredged up these crimes from decades ago.
[03:54:57.135 --> 03:54:59.117]  Well that's like me and these dozens of fake lawsuits.
[03:54:59.217 --> 03:55:02.640]  Once they get there, the judges are like, he didn't even say any of this.
[03:55:03.666 --> 03:55:05.127]  And they're like, well, we don't have to prove our case.
[03:55:05.167 --> 03:55:06.367]  These are families or whatever.
[03:55:06.427 --> 03:55:09.188]  And it just gets weirder and weirder and weirder.
[03:55:09.208 --> 03:55:12.629]  You know, what I found in the case that was dismissed against me in D.C.
[03:55:12.730 --> 03:55:14.150]  is, here's their new tactic.
[03:55:15.331 --> 03:55:22.413]  Roger Stone received allegedly hacked emails from the Russians and he gave them to WikiLeaks.
[03:55:22.753 --> 03:55:23.554]  Well, where's your proof?
[03:55:23.834 --> 03:55:26.155]  Well, it's right here in this Media Matters story.
[03:55:26.375 --> 03:55:27.335]  There's the proof, Your Honor.
[03:55:27.395 --> 03:55:28.376]  There's the proof.
[03:55:28.396 --> 03:55:31.417]  They like walking with the New York Times, like, and it's like,
[03:55:32.077 --> 03:55:36.098]  Alex Jones rapes midgets, and I'm like, well, the New York Times says so.
[03:55:36.158 --> 03:55:37.719]  He pours cream gravy on their head first.
[03:55:37.939 --> 03:55:45.881]  So this whole idea that we don't need proof or evidence, the proof of the evidence now is a clipping from a fake news outlet that says something happened.
[03:55:46.121 --> 03:55:48.382]  And that's what they point to, and they expect people to believe it.
[03:55:48.402 --> 03:55:50.763]  And the fake news points at the fake lawsuits or indictments.
[03:55:50.823 --> 03:55:51.043]  Right.
[03:55:51.183 --> 03:55:52.203]  So it's a cycle.
[03:55:52.583 --> 03:55:54.044]  It's a circular BS machine.
[03:55:54.384 --> 03:55:56.025]  So how do folks donate to your legal defense fund?
[03:55:56.045 --> 03:55:58.567]  You can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:55:58.587 --> 03:56:00.228]  We'll bring up the icon for you.
[03:56:01.108 --> 03:56:05.131]  I met with a very high-powered lawyer who I think I'm going to have to hire to defend me.
[03:56:05.531 --> 03:56:08.753]  He told me my legal defense will cost at least $2 million.
[03:56:09.534 --> 03:56:12.415]  So you can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:12.696 --> 03:56:14.136]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:14.176 --> 03:56:16.638]  And please folks, this threatens to bankrupt me.
[03:56:16.678 --> 03:56:20.881]  Now you can go online right now and you'll see a story that says Roger Stone is worth $20 million.
[03:56:21.681 --> 03:56:22.522]  Shame on me.
[03:56:22.902 --> 03:56:25.425]  I had the New York Times and they're like, you've got 70 million dollars.
[03:56:25.525 --> 03:56:26.766]  I'm like, in my dreams.
[03:56:26.886 --> 03:56:27.647]  It's like, no.
[03:56:27.667 --> 03:56:29.308]  It's all in this building.
[03:56:29.348 --> 03:56:30.189]  It's in this operation.
[03:56:30.570 --> 03:56:32.832]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.

[03:56:44.483 --> 03:56:45.444]  And look, I'm thanking you.
[03:56:45.484 --> 03:56:48.087]  I'm not bitching at you saying, hey, belly up.
[03:56:48.127 --> 03:56:50.570]  They're after us because we're the only main resistance.
[03:56:51.011 --> 03:56:54.074]  We're creating the truthful talking points that counter the globalists.
[03:56:55.295 --> 03:56:57.217]  And that's why they've made us the number one enemy.
[03:56:57.297 --> 03:56:57.838]  And you're right.
[03:56:57.918 --> 03:57:00.741]  Right now, we've got massive audiences, bigger than ever.
[03:57:01.977 --> 03:57:05.900]  When we've been cut off these platforms, they even say we're betting people forget and move on.
[03:57:06.060 --> 03:57:07.041]  I'm betting they don't, Roger.
[03:57:07.101 --> 03:57:08.021]  And let's be very clear.
[03:57:08.221 --> 03:57:09.102]  We're a test case.
[03:57:09.783 --> 03:57:18.929]  If it's Alex Jones today, it's Sean Hannity tomorrow, and Laura Ingraham, and Tucker Carlson, and Rush Limbaugh, and Mike Savage, and all these other patriots that I admire.
[03:57:19.269 --> 03:57:20.010]  They are next.
[03:57:20.110 --> 03:57:21.091]  We're the test case.
[03:57:21.371 --> 03:57:25.794]  If they get away with it with Alex Jones, all of those voices will be silenced.
[03:57:25.934 --> 03:57:26.234]  That's right.
[03:57:26.314 --> 03:57:30.117]  War Room's coming up at Infowars.com forward slash show and on stations around the country.
[03:57:30.397 --> 03:57:31.878]  However, you're listening to Spread the Word with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:32.218 --> 03:57:35.059]  In about an hour, Roger Stone will be in there with him and so much more.
[03:57:35.080 --> 03:57:40.223]  But I'm going to put my video response to Lester Holt lying about me with incredible dangerous defamation.
[03:57:40.703 --> 03:57:42.764]  Folks, I've said the media's going to attack themselves.
[03:57:42.804 --> 03:57:44.505]  Now they say I'm going to attack the media.
[03:57:44.845 --> 03:57:46.606]  Now you know they're getting ready for a false flag.
[03:57:46.786 --> 03:57:47.267]  Red Alert.
[03:57:47.627 --> 03:57:48.187]  Emergency.
[03:57:48.227 --> 03:57:48.988]  God bless you all.
[03:57:50.135 --> 03:57:54.499]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[03:57:55.580 --> 03:58:00.144]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[03:58:02.146 --> 03:58:05.228]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[03:58:06.129 --> 03:58:07.851]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[03:58:11.718 --> 03:58:16.220]  Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[03:58:16.460 --> 03:58:21.003]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[03:58:21.303 --> 03:58:25.365]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[03:58:29.687 --> 03:58:40.252]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[03:58:42.353 --> 03:58:44.416]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[03:58:44.436 --> 03:58:49.463]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[03:58:50.144 --> 03:58:51.325]  He's not a politician.
[03:58:52.147 --> 03:58:52.827]  He's one of us.
[03:58:55.331 --> 03:58:57.414]  Never, ever, ever give up.
