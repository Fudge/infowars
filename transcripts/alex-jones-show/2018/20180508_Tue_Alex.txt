[00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:22.446]  Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars, and in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in all
[00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:24.027]  We're good to go.
[00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:45.524]  InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[00:00:46.104 --> 00:00:57.612]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:07.578]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:09.480]  Demand truth.
[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.141]  Demand InfoWars.
[00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:13.682]  InfoWars.
[00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.682]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:39.148]  Well, we've got this whole Schneiderman situation, who's the right-hand man of the incredibly corrupt governor, who has his other corrupt brother that works over at CNN, and we've got
[00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:51.108]  Snyderman who is caught right dead center in the fact that he's the guy in charge of the whole Harvey Weinstein cover-up.
[00:01:52.928 --> 00:02:10.232]  So we have that situation and it just shows how incestuous and out of control the Democratic Party is and he's now resigning over all these women coming out saying that he basically beat him up, slapped him around, sexually assaulted him.
[00:02:12.014 --> 00:02:13.434]  That's what these gangster thugs do.
[00:02:14.835 --> 00:02:17.455]  And the guy is just a creep fest even looking at him.
[00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.496]  But who do you think covers up for all this stuff in New York?
[00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:23.737]  People like Schneiderman.
[00:02:25.117 --> 00:02:27.098]  We've got these really creepy videos coming up.
[00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:29.658]  Steve Watson's got an article about it on Infowars.com.
[00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:31.519]  This didn't age well.
[00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:40.661]  Samantha Bee described Schneiderman as a superhero who could stop Trump and his sexual abuse.
[00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:44.817]  Isn't that just classic?
[00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.420]  Isn't that just amazing?
[00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:55.667]  Now, that said, that's a big piece of news.
[00:02:56.548 --> 00:02:58.750]  It just shows the incredible hypocrisy of these people.
[00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:04.935]  But the even bigger news, when we come back, is something we already knew.
[00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.477]  It was in the court records.
[00:03:07.658 --> 00:03:08.218]  It was in the
[00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:19.486]  CPS records, it was in the Department of Families records, about a week after the Parkland shooting back in February.
[00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:39.441]  And the media would just say it's not true, it's an Alex Jones conspiracy theory, it's a Fox News conspiracy theory, that Nick Cruz was in a leftist program that even if you commit all sorts of crimes, if you are a minority, I guess because he has the name Cruz, he's supposedly Hispanic,
[00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:42.235]  Even though he was adopted.
[00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:44.356]  Didn't look Hispanic to me, but whatever.
[00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:47.799]  Or black, or Asian, or anything else but white.
[00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.340]  You don't go to jail.
[00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:59.808]  And they had denied that he was part of that, but now the Sun-Sentinel, WJC-TV, they're all reporting it's confirmed.
[00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:08.415]  What's the future of Broward County's Promise Program after news Nick Cruz was referred there and was part of it?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.184]  Stoneman Douglas Shooter was assigned a controversial Broward County program, officials admit.
[00:04:18.388 --> 00:04:20.530]  He was put into this in 2013.
[00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:24.854]  He was allowed to say, I'm gonna kill people, I'm gonna murder you.
[00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:27.376]  He was known as Mr. School Shooter.
[00:04:28.697 --> 00:04:30.059]  And there was a stand down that day.
[00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.744]  Now what they do to our videos the week of the attack with eyewitnesses and local news reports saying they stood down.
[00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:41.498]  YouTube deleted them, CNN called Rusty Band and said that we said no one died.
[00:04:43.978 --> 00:04:56.242]  And now, they're in the Washington Post claiming that I said, not just that Emma Gonzalez was a crisis actor, which I didn't say, but that I blamed some other woman in another state, and that I need to be sued.
[00:04:56.943 --> 00:05:00.784]  Total defamation, total fraud by criminal media.
[00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:08.227]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:09.727]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:10.128]  Go ahead.
[00:05:10.248 --> 00:05:10.528]  Yes.
[00:05:10.968 --> 00:05:11.688]  Hi, Alex.
[00:05:11.788 --> 00:05:17.991]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:22.173]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:23.854]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:31.157]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it like
[00:05:31.437 --> 00:05:34.078]  I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:37.560]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.440]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:47.304]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:53.166]  But when you mention the Silver Bullock Oil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:05:53.286 --> 00:05:54.767]  It is our highest reviewed product.
[00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:58.629]  Because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.711]  It's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:17.862]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here, on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:06:38.348 --> 00:06:49.876]  The only thing that can surpass the evil and outright corruption of the globalists, of leftists, of communists around the world is their incredible hypocrisy.
[00:06:50.777 --> 00:07:01.384]  Their legendary fraud where they say that rich people are bad but they're the richest people in the world and set up tax-exempt programs for themselves where they have diplomatic immunity.
[00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.178]  And part of that arrogance is that they're constantly caught in brutal sex crimes against men, women, and children.
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.722]  Whether it's Harvey Weinstein or whether it's Bill Clinton.
[00:07:15.844 --> 00:07:23.211]  And now you have New York's AG Eric Schneiderman, the right-hand man of the gangster kingpin,
[00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:30.373]  Governor Cuomo and his hit-and-run drunk driving brother over on CNN.
[00:07:30.393 --> 00:07:40.477]  Well, Mr. Creepy Eyes has all these credible women coming forward saying he would beat the living daylights out of them and then sexually assault them.
[00:07:42.978 --> 00:07:52.843]  Well, that fits into the thuggering of Cuomo that said two years ago, if you're a Christian or you're a conservative or you're pro-life, get the bleep out of New York.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.381]  And the media said a few days later to Cuomo, they said, you don't mean that.
[00:07:57.401 --> 00:07:58.502]  And he said, I mean it.
[00:07:58.702 --> 00:07:59.502]  Get out of here.
[00:08:00.462 --> 00:08:01.683]  We're going to run you out.
[00:08:03.724 --> 00:08:04.964]  These are bullies.
[00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:07.205]  These are thugs.
[00:08:08.966 --> 00:08:23.892]  And I want to play a clip here of Samantha Bee, another force-fed, failed comic, describing Schneiderman as a, quote, superhero who would stop
[00:08:25.106 --> 00:08:34.170]  Trump, now remember Trump was talking about like Elvis when you have all the teenage girls pulling their panties off and throwing them at him when he first became a super hit in the 1950s.
[00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:42.853]  And Trump was saying women will climb up on top of you, they'll jump on top of you and they'll just let you, you know, go right at it.
[00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:45.614]  No women have ever accused him of assault.
[00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:47.635]  Stormy Daniels said he treated her really nice.
[00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:53.231]  Her response is, you know, she wants him to resign, on and on and on.
[00:08:53.691 --> 00:09:03.477]  But she said, are you going to lead us out of darkness as feminist, progressive comedian Samantha Bee of Democratic New York Attorney Eric Schneiderman?
[00:09:05.358 --> 00:09:08.900]  And look, it's not just one photo of him that's really creepy.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.323]  This morning I was looking at photos of him and last night, so I clicked on Google Images,
[00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:26.267]  And I don't really go to Google as much, so I went over to Being Images, and I clicked it, and it's just every photo, if you saw this guy walking down the street at night, you'd think he was like a vampire or something.
[00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:36.154]  I mean, he looks so crazed, so aggressive, so out of control, so completely arrogant.
[00:09:36.855 --> 00:09:41.438]  And the women are saying that, again, he brutally beat the living snot out of him.
[00:09:44.628 --> 00:09:45.809]  And sexually assaulted him.
[00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.471]  The woman didn't give him what he wanted.
[00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:50.332]  I mean, look at this photo.
[00:09:50.352 --> 00:09:52.333]  Document cam shot, please, for TV viewers.
[00:09:52.453 --> 00:09:54.114]  Look at that crazed maniac.
[00:09:56.916 --> 00:09:58.818]  There's just something about these evil people.
[00:09:58.918 --> 00:10:01.139]  It's like, Skelter has that look.
[00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:05.342]  Hillary has that look.
[00:10:05.382 --> 00:10:10.806]  They have this evil look that is like right out of American Psycho.
[00:10:11.909 --> 00:10:14.891]  You can really judge the book by its cover with this guy.
[00:10:15.132 --> 00:10:16.893]  Here, let me try to make the face right now for a team of yours.
[00:10:21.937 --> 00:10:23.138]  Hi, let me post this photo.
[00:10:25.079 --> 00:10:26.120]  Hi, I'm Brian Stelter.
[00:10:26.921 --> 00:10:30.904]  And it's like, do they not know how psychotic they look?
[00:10:31.284 --> 00:10:35.087]  But they think that that's power.
[00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:47.603]  They think looking like a complete lunatic is good because they're around all these other yes-men and women in government, and they just stomp around all day on these power trips.
[00:10:49.104 --> 00:10:59.770]  And their latest talking point is a recycled one on Trump that he's not fit, he's embarrassed the presidency, when they're the ones attacking the presidency like never before.
[00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:06.174]  They always, you know, criticize even Bush or Clinton or Obama because, you know, it'll hurt the presidency.
[00:11:07.045 --> 00:11:08.966]  But now they're saying Trump has hurt the presidency.
[00:11:09.006 --> 00:11:18.571]  These people are a permanent, so-called ruling class of sycophantic kleptocrats, and they can't believe they're being thrown from power.
[00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:27.156]  Eric Schneiderman called me his brown slave, which slapped me until I called him master.
[00:11:29.778 --> 00:11:31.879]  Now when you look at his face, do you believe that?
[00:11:34.502 --> 00:11:59.917]  And you look at his thuggish statements and his actions, and you look at how, oh here's the big one, he ran the Harvey Weinstein investigation a couple years ago that got shut down, even though women, multiple women, was it seven women, are known to have gone to the police and said, Weinstein raped me in the back of a car, Weinstein raped me in a shower, Weinstein raped me in a hotel room, he, he, Weinstein raped me in a closet.
[00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:05.048]  And then you've got the driver of Weinstein.
[00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:06.989]  You've got the butler of Weinstein.
[00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.271]  All saying he would rape women.
[00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:12.914]  He likes 9,500 pound women that look like they're 15 years old.
[00:12:12.934 --> 00:12:13.835]  These are quotes.
[00:12:14.495 --> 00:12:19.680]  And Weinstein pins them with his huge 300 pound weight and rapes them.
[00:12:22.982 --> 00:12:24.544]  Now, what does that earn?
[00:12:28.783 --> 00:12:29.904]  People like Schneiderman.
[00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:31.284]  Well, it earns him this.
[00:12:31.325 --> 00:12:35.927]  So here's the feminist progressive teaching that if a guy asks you out, it's rape.
[00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:44.893]  And it was four women accused him of physical abuse and, of course, sexual activities.
[00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:47.774]  But it's getting a lot bigger.
[00:12:47.794 --> 00:12:49.755]  Remember, he was the Me Too guy.
[00:12:52.317 --> 00:12:55.039]  So let's go ahead and roll Samantha Bee.
[00:12:55.099 --> 00:12:55.499]  Here it is.
[00:12:56.189 --> 00:13:01.898]  Today is November 8th, which means Donald Trump was elected president exactly 100 years ago.
[00:13:01.918 --> 00:13:03.441]  I'm kidding.
[00:13:03.521 --> 00:13:04.382]  It's only been a year.
[00:13:04.402 --> 00:13:05.904]  Oh my, where'd this come from?
[00:13:11.451 --> 00:13:14.814]  President Bonespurr has had more endurance than predicted.
[00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:20.758]  Especially if you were predicting his endurance by looking at literally any photo of him being physical ever.
[00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:23.541]  But there is hope on the horizon.
[00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:26.783]  A hero who stood up to democracy's nemesis before.
[00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:28.424]  Look up in the sky!
[00:13:28.865 --> 00:13:29.645]  It's a bird!
[00:13:30.146 --> 00:13:31.006]  It's a plane!
[00:13:31.387 --> 00:13:34.649]  It's... I'm Eric Schneiderman and I'm the Attorney General of the State of New York.
[00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.912]  The lawyer for the State of New York and for the people of the State of New York.
[00:13:38.263 --> 00:13:39.946]  Happy one year sad-iversary.
[00:13:39.966 --> 00:13:40.647]  Oh, thank you.
[00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:44.494]  You must be so happy that Trump won because he's giving you so much material.
[00:13:44.514 --> 00:13:46.378]  What a great time to be an attorney!
[00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:52.931]  Yeah, it's like a toxic volcano that just keeps belching out bad public policies.
[00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:55.192]  But we have a very strong legal resistance.
[00:13:55.492 --> 00:13:57.473]  Are you going to lead us out of the darkness?
[00:13:57.934 --> 00:14:05.478]  State Attorneys General are going to be the first line of defense because the Constitution kept a lot of power at the state level to hold a potential tyrant in check.
[00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:09.780]  We have that power now and with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:14:10.396 --> 00:14:11.457]  Oh my God!
[00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:18.860]  He's... No.
[00:14:20.721 --> 00:14:21.842]  It's not going to be one hero.
[00:14:22.102 --> 00:14:23.543]  It's not going to be a quick fix for this.
[00:14:23.803 --> 00:14:30.466]  But I got colleagues all around the country, a network of progressive attorneys general who are really in the core of the legal resistance.
[00:14:30.626 --> 00:14:32.207]  You are fighting the good fight.
[00:14:32.607 --> 00:14:33.148]  Many fights.
[00:14:33.448 --> 00:14:36.250]  So we had a meeting in January before Trump took office.
[00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.811]  We had to anticipate what was coming.
[00:14:37.971 --> 00:14:41.313]  So you assembled your anti-Trump squad of attorney generals?
[00:14:41.734 --> 00:14:42.574]  Attorneys general.
[00:14:43.535 --> 00:14:44.556]  Like Carl's Jr.? ?
[00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:57.107]  And Eric's Justice League has challenged Trump over the first travel ban, pesticides, student loans, the second travel ban, smog, methane, Obamacare subsidies, DACA, the third travel ban, trans rights, clean power plant, and birth control access.
[00:14:58.108 --> 00:15:05.234]  We beat him on travel ban one, we beat him on travel ban two, we beat him on environmental regulations, and the transgender military ban, and we will continue to fight.
[00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:07.276]  You are a superhero.
[00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:07.877]  No.
[00:15:08.878 --> 00:15:11.520]  Why don't we see what happens if you go into that telephone booth over there?
[00:15:14.291 --> 00:15:27.213]  Trump tweeted in 2013 when some people got caught engaging in sexual crimes and pervert activities that wait until Schneiderman got exposed and that he was the worst.
[00:15:28.234 --> 00:15:32.894]  Wiener is gone, Spitzer is gone, next will be lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman.
[00:15:33.234 --> 00:15:33.875]  Is he a crook?
[00:15:34.315 --> 00:15:34.955]  Wait and see.
[00:15:35.115 --> 00:15:36.495]  Worse than Spitzer and Wiener.
[00:15:38.215 --> 00:15:41.456]  And Wiener, it's young people, children, and Spitzer, it's
[00:15:42.634 --> 00:15:44.096]  Assad operatives.
[00:15:44.757 --> 00:15:45.538]  So there you go.
[00:15:45.618 --> 00:15:46.899]  Trump knows what's going on.
[00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:48.361]  Trump knows where the bodies are buried.
[00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:50.644]  And it's all part of their legal resistance.
[00:15:50.684 --> 00:15:53.487]  Yeah, all the fake lawsuits against me, everybody else.
[00:15:53.507 --> 00:15:55.910]  It's all part of trying to bully America.
[00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:57.352]  Good luck, scum.
[00:15:57.372 --> 00:15:58.193]  You want to fight?
[00:15:58.713 --> 00:15:59.474]  You got one.
[00:15:59.835 --> 00:16:01.456]  We'll be back with the even bigger news.

[00:16:51.847 --> 00:16:52.908]  That means it's clean.
[00:16:53.268 --> 00:16:54.289]  That means it's pure.
[00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:57.212]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.

[00:17:14.156 --> 00:17:19.320]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:17:19.661 --> 00:17:22.443]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:22.663 --> 00:17:31.430]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:33.531 --> 00:17:52.646]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:53.146 --> 00:17:54.427]  It is amazing!
[00:17:55.808 --> 00:18:00.792]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.

[00:19:09.524 --> 00:19:11.905]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:19:11.945 --> 00:19:12.866]  We've beaten six.

[00:20:06.354 --> 00:20:09.076]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.606 --> 00:20:30.733]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.399 --> 00:20:46.503]  You know, we got the left with all these out-of-control attorney generals and lawyers guilds suing every nationalist, every capitalist, every pro-American patriot in the country.
[00:20:46.523 --> 00:20:50.525]  Just basically everybody's being sued in an attempt to intimidate us and make us back down.
[00:20:50.565 --> 00:20:51.125]  Not gonna happen.
[00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:59.328]  We're honored to fight for this country and we realize giving in to your tyranny is a hundred times worse than fighting you and defeating you.
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.701]  In fact, fighting you and defeating you is ecstasy.
[00:21:03.081 --> 00:21:03.862]  And we are winning.
[00:21:04.282 --> 00:21:04.922]  Make no mistake.
[00:21:05.382 --> 00:21:06.583]  I don't operate like the globalists.
[00:21:06.603 --> 00:21:07.763]  If we were losing, I'd tell you.
[00:21:07.823 --> 00:21:08.524]  We are winning.
[00:21:08.864 --> 00:21:16.307]  But they are panicking and they are exerting their full force trying to stop the resurgence of nationalism, not just here, but worldwide.
[00:21:17.008 --> 00:21:20.109]  Now, next segment, because it's longer.
[00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:28.053]  When I read this last night, at about 10 o'clock, I got so angry
[00:21:29.352 --> 00:21:33.736]  That despite the fact that I was sleepy, I couldn't go to bed for a couple hours.
[00:21:37.399 --> 00:21:42.304]  And it makes me mad because in hindsight, you can see their designs.
[00:21:44.265 --> 00:21:46.487]  In hindsight, you can see what they did.
[00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:54.715]  And you can see what they're planning to do again and again and again and again and again and again.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:08.766]  Trump pointed out that 98% of mass shootings happen in victim disarmament zones at the NRA speech he gave.
[00:22:09.587 --> 00:22:10.567]  The media attacked that.
[00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:12.849]  They said, is it really true?
[00:22:13.529 --> 00:22:15.551]  And then obfuscated, they never really even answered it.
[00:22:16.611 --> 00:22:17.212]  But it is true.
[00:22:18.633 --> 00:22:22.075]  Mass shootings kill less than 50 people a year, by the way, in schools.
[00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:27.218]  But they pump it all up and then tell gun owners we're all to blame.
[00:22:27.239 --> 00:22:29.120]  It's all about projecting guilt, but
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.061]  Last night, it came out in the Sunset Knoll.
[00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:35.341]  It came out in local TV.
[00:22:35.581 --> 00:22:36.842]  Broward County went okay.
[00:22:37.802 --> 00:22:51.566]  For four years, four plus, excuse me, four and a half, Nick Cruz was in a thing called Promise Program that Google's pushing.
[00:22:54.738 --> 00:22:59.161]  Where you let people off for crimes, but only if they're a minority.
[00:22:59.862 --> 00:23:22.539]  I happen to have a stack of news here, just today, every day there's a stack, from Belgium, from France, from Sweden, from Finland, where islamicist rape, in fact, when you pulled me yesterday's stack, some of that was in there, 10 year old girls, 80 something year old women, you name it, and are allowed off saying it's their culture.
[00:23:24.923 --> 00:23:32.287]  It's like importing New Guinea headhunters and saying they're allowed to, you know, kill your wife and shrink her head.
[00:23:34.389 --> 00:23:36.190]  But that's true authoritarianism.
[00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.372]  And then here it is, confirmed when we already knew this.
[00:23:40.412 --> 00:23:41.393]  This came out a week after.
[00:23:41.593 --> 00:23:43.174]  But the media said we were liars.
[00:23:46.976 --> 00:23:47.877]  And then it didn't exist.
[00:23:50.413 --> 00:23:51.674]  I'm going to cover that next segment.
[00:23:51.895 --> 00:23:52.856]  I'm already getting into it.
[00:23:53.076 --> 00:23:55.619]  And then now it's all confirmed, but only in the local news.
[00:23:57.821 --> 00:23:58.522]  They stood down.
[00:23:58.602 --> 00:23:59.864]  The police physically stood down.
[00:23:59.904 --> 00:24:01.005]  They knew what he was planning.
[00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:05.690]  This was a false flag, folks, but not in the way they claim I said that was a false flag.
[00:24:06.271 --> 00:24:07.132]  Real people died.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:22.469]  The anti-gun four students that went around, you know, from the 3000 and got all the attention, they weren't crisis actors, I never said that, and the media smoke-screened what they really did by lying about what I said, and that makes me mad.
[00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:23.069]  Not for me!
[00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:37.819]  But what you did to those kids and those families, and you know full well what you did, globalist, MSM, and then you use lies about me to smoke-screen how you stood down and you let him go in there and kill those people, and I'm sick of your crap!
[00:24:38.717 --> 00:24:39.737]  And I'm going to get you!
[00:24:40.337 --> 00:24:41.858]  And my listeners are going to get you!
[00:24:41.878 --> 00:24:46.098]  Because when we come back, there's a new wrinkle.
[00:24:49.519 --> 00:24:52.140]  They're saying again that I said nobody died.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.001]  And they've got a woman on there saying I'm sending people after her with no proof.
[00:24:57.421 --> 00:24:58.961]  And I've got to sue the Washington Post.
[00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:00.021]  But it's Bezos.
[00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:02.582]  He makes $12 billion a day!
[00:25:02.602 --> 00:25:04.382]  A week and a half ago.
[00:25:08.567 --> 00:25:14.049]  And you read it and they just say, Jones told people it was her, some 30-something year old woman.
[00:25:14.109 --> 00:25:15.730]  I never said any such thing!
[00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:17.730]  And of course they don't show the proof.
[00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:27.214]  And then they set it up where this woman's a victim of me, and I didn't do jack squat.
[00:25:27.334 --> 00:25:29.075]  They're the ones putting her out there.
[00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:30.635]  They're the ones saying this stuff.
[00:25:31.616 --> 00:25:32.916]  I'm gonna break it all down coming up.
[00:25:35.797 --> 00:25:37.278]  It's just incredible.
[00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.414]  How the media and these lawyers are completely psychotic.
[00:25:44.155 --> 00:25:46.397]  They have no morals.
[00:25:47.358 --> 00:25:49.740]  In fact, they're stupid because this is destroying them.
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.641]  People are learning about their lies.
[00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:52.902]  They're learning how they do this.
[00:25:53.623 --> 00:25:54.604]  We have the thinkers.
[00:25:55.224 --> 00:26:01.550]  They have the deranged losers and wannabe victims that sign on to all this so they can have their 15 minutes of fame.
[00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.193]  Because after all, Alex Jones is bad and he deserves to be lied about.
[00:26:09.727 --> 00:26:12.068]  So the Washington Post Bezos are just monsters.
[00:26:12.108 --> 00:26:18.751]  And by the way, Bezos Bezos has banned Christians from the charity program on there.
[00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:24.093]  Every church in this country and every Christian should be boycotting Amazon.
[00:26:24.113 --> 00:26:29.315]  We're gonna go to break and I'm gonna come back.
[00:26:29.415 --> 00:26:31.756]  I already started getting into it, but I'm gonna go through the actual articles.
[00:26:33.188 --> 00:26:38.030]  It makes me so upset to know they knowingly knew it, and they all called him the school shooter for years.
[00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:39.230]  They knew he was coming.
[00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:40.491]  They stood down.
[00:26:40.951 --> 00:26:42.051]  He was in foster care.
[00:26:42.071 --> 00:26:43.632]  His parents had mysteriously died.
[00:26:44.032 --> 00:26:46.273]  He was all wound up on government-issued drugs.
[00:26:46.613 --> 00:26:48.534]  He shows up, and the police stand down.
[00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:58.978]  No wonder they jumped on me day one and said, don't say it's staged, because it was staged in that they stood down and knew he was coming and had all the PR ready.
[00:27:00.748 --> 00:27:04.049]  That's why they were so scared and up front saying, Jones says nobody died.
[00:27:04.329 --> 00:27:05.409]  Jones says they're all actors.
[00:27:05.429 --> 00:27:06.409]  Jones says it's staged.
[00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.911]  Because it wasn't staged in that people died, but they knew and they stood down.
[00:27:11.131 --> 00:27:11.391]  Wow.
[00:27:12.011 --> 00:27:15.372]  The article from Information Liberation is on Infowars.com.
[00:27:15.712 --> 00:27:16.592]  It's an excellent article.
[00:27:16.612 --> 00:27:19.673]  I want to get that Chris author on.
[00:27:19.733 --> 00:27:21.513]  Chris, I've pronounced his name.
[00:27:22.614 --> 00:27:23.854]  It's too far away on the screen there.
[00:27:23.874 --> 00:27:25.714]  I want to get him on.
[00:27:25.774 --> 00:27:26.635]  He's a really smart writer.
[00:27:27.155 --> 00:27:28.195]  But this is just crazy.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.941]  Anti-racism program.
[00:27:30.981 --> 00:27:34.603]  Okay, before I go any further, we have Icarin back in stock.
[00:27:34.703 --> 00:27:36.184]  It came out four months ago.
[00:27:36.704 --> 00:27:45.348]  It is a liver and kidney cleanse of concentrated, known, healthy compounds that will flush the heavy toxins and garbage out of the liver and kidney.
[00:27:45.368 --> 00:27:46.169]  That's what they're designed to do.
[00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:47.990]  Safely, gently, but effectively.
[00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:50.291]  Icarin is amazing.
[00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:52.992]  It's got all these really, really good things in it for you.
[00:27:53.993 --> 00:27:55.694]  It is now back in stock.
[00:27:56.641 --> 00:27:59.402]  And we're doing a huge 40% off.
[00:28:01.603 --> 00:28:02.084]  It's simple.
[00:28:02.124 --> 00:28:07.706]  The more toxins and diseases find their way into your system, the more important it is that your body detox system can keep up.
[00:28:08.327 --> 00:28:11.388]  Because your liver and kidneys are, without a doubt, the most important detoxifiers.
[00:28:11.808 --> 00:28:17.591]  It's time you took care of them, like they take care of you with Icarin, for 40% off within four hours of life.
[00:28:18.191 --> 00:28:25.395]  Concentrated milk thistle, 600 milligrams of Silamerian.
[00:28:27.389 --> 00:28:29.390]  The N-acetylcysteine.
[00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:32.532]  Organic amula fruit.
[00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:36.275]  Organic bublerium root.
[00:28:36.555 --> 00:28:37.676]  These words are really hard to say.
[00:28:38.076 --> 00:28:39.497]  Organic licorice root.
[00:28:39.577 --> 00:28:40.678]  Organic artichoke leaf.
[00:28:40.758 --> 00:28:41.438]  And many, many more.
[00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:43.720]  Icarin also funds the operation.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.320]  The purchases.
[00:28:44.761 --> 00:28:46.882]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:50.277 --> 00:29:01.671]  And we also have the entire Super Blue family of fluoride-free toothpaste, mouthwashes, and immune gargles at 50% off and free shipping on the Big Combo Pack.
[00:29:03.973 --> 00:29:09.636]  Former Secretary of State John Kerry has been having secret meetings with foreign officials to keep the U.S.
[00:29:09.736 --> 00:29:10.977]  in the Iran nuclear deal.
[00:29:11.277 --> 00:29:13.239]  And President Trump is not having it.
[00:29:13.619 --> 00:29:16.861]  Kerry was one of the key architects of the Iran deal, which was signed in 2015.
[00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:27.027]  And the Boston Globe reported last week that he'd been quietly meeting with Iranian and EU officials in recent months to strategize how to save his legacy.
[00:29:27.407 --> 00:29:34.972]  Trump tweeted the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.
[00:29:35.212 --> 00:29:37.853]  He was the one that curated this mess in the first place.
[00:29:38.253 --> 00:29:45.898]  President Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal calling it one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the US has ever entered into.
[00:29:46.218 --> 00:29:53.402]  Back in February of 2017, President Trump tweeted, Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S.
[00:29:53.442 --> 00:29:58.445]  came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal, $150 billion.
[00:29:58.625 --> 00:30:01.466]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com.
[00:30:07.049 --> 00:30:12.072]  I thought I'd have a couple of the Barrett 50 Cals in here for TV viewers.
[00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.692]  The Pat and Q, we'll set those up here in front for everybody.
[00:30:16.093 --> 00:30:16.593]  Wanna see them?
[00:30:17.414 --> 00:30:20.116]  And that's the, what, the Army or Marine Corps version, right?
[00:30:20.136 --> 00:30:24.099]  And you got the, what the Navy tends to use right there, a little bit short-barreled 50 cal.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.742]  We're gonna go to Michael Savage right now and get his take on that.
[00:30:26.762 --> 00:30:27.802]  We're gonna get back into his new book.
[00:30:27.842 --> 00:30:29.244]  Dr. Savage, what do you think of those babies?
[00:30:30.184 --> 00:30:34.468]  I think you guys should come visit San Francisco and we'll take a stroll down Broadway with those guns.
[00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:37.931]  What do you think folks would do if they saw that?
[00:30:39.524 --> 00:30:41.586]  In San Francisco, they probably wouldn't even notice it.
[00:30:42.066 --> 00:30:44.148]  They're so stoned, they wouldn't even notice it.
[00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:54.277]  But first off, the epic moment we're at as a society and a culture, where they are ready to burn everything down just to stop not just Trump, but America's resurgence.
[00:30:54.657 --> 00:30:59.742]  Michael Savage, this is... How do you quantify this moment we're in as a civilization?
[00:30:59.762 --> 00:31:01.443]  And thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:31:02.424 --> 00:31:04.566]  Well, remember, I live in the San Francisco area.
[00:31:04.606 --> 00:31:06.748]  What could be better than this for show topics?
[00:31:07.663 --> 00:31:21.097]  And remember, you say, well why do you, people keep saying, Savage, why do you live in the most psycho-leftist area in the world where a maniac like Pelosi the other day said we don't need to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out the drugs, the criminals, the illegals.
[00:31:21.478 --> 00:31:23.079]  She said mow the grass instead.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.781]  That's speech, Alex.
[00:31:25.122 --> 00:31:26.903]  Mow the grass instead of building a wall.
[00:31:27.064 --> 00:31:29.286]  And she's not taken out with a butterfly net.
[00:31:29.386 --> 00:31:31.447]  You've got to have a sense of humor about these lunatics.
[00:31:31.567 --> 00:31:32.728]  But they can be dangerous.
[00:31:33.088 --> 00:31:33.988]  I know what it leads to.
[00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:35.869]  The brainwashing is complete.
[00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.310]  They don't even know they're crazy.
[00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:38.711]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:31:38.731 --> 00:31:39.832]  I wrote that in 2006.
[00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:41.052]  But it was true.
[00:31:41.172 --> 00:31:42.693]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[00:31:42.733 --> 00:31:45.194]  We're living through crazier times than ever, and there's a reason for it.
[00:31:45.355 --> 00:31:48.556]  Alex, I don't know how one man can take so much hatred and so many lies.
[00:31:48.896 --> 00:31:50.517]  We know every president is criticized.
[00:31:51.078 --> 00:31:57.181]  But I've never seen such an organized hate campaign as I do against Donald Trump and anyone who supports him.
[00:31:57.921 --> 00:31:59.022]  Never in my lifetime.
[00:31:59.102 --> 00:32:03.565]  I know there's always been dissension one side and the other, but it's never been this level of insanity.
[00:32:04.206 --> 00:32:08.409]  How this man Trump can take it all is almost a miracle of human nature.
[00:32:08.849 --> 00:32:14.052]  Either he's much stronger than I even thought he was when I backed him from the beginning, or he's decided, you know what?
[00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:14.633]  Screw them.
[00:32:15.093 --> 00:32:16.134]  They want to push me down?
[00:32:16.174 --> 00:32:17.355]  I'll push them down first.
[00:32:18.035 --> 00:32:20.677]  I think his fighting spirit is so strong that he will prevail.
[00:32:21.337 --> 00:32:26.401]  When Trump finally catches his breath and becomes the president that we know he really is,
[00:32:27.328 --> 00:32:29.570]  And he gets the people around him who he needs.
[00:32:30.331 --> 00:32:33.153]  I can pretty much predict what's gonna happen to all these scum.
[00:32:33.794 --> 00:32:36.616]  They're gonna be on their jets heading to Switzerland or Austria.
[00:32:36.636 --> 00:32:38.478]  They're not gonna be in this country, Alex.
[00:32:38.758 --> 00:32:42.181]  The day will come, they'll fuel up their jet and they'll never be seen again.
[00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:44.128]  And that's going to happen, Alex.
[00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:45.188]  It's long overdue.
[00:32:45.829 --> 00:32:46.969]  We've got to support Trump.
[00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.391]  As imperfect as he is, he is all we have.
[00:32:50.431 --> 00:32:56.134]  We must not let the lies of the globalist left get to us and make us think he's not exactly... You're right.
[00:32:56.154 --> 00:32:56.755]  He's a champion.
[00:32:56.795 --> 00:32:57.435]  He's a champion.
[00:32:57.455 --> 00:32:59.196]  And just what he's taken, what he's done is amazing.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.961]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.283 --> 00:33:20.064]  We are on the march.
[00:33:20.084 --> 00:33:21.365]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:21.586 --> 00:33:24.588]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:24.708 --> 00:33:28.431]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:33.074]  You win some, lose some, and do the same to me.
[00:33:33.094 --> 00:33:38.138]  The pleasure is to play.
[00:33:38.418 --> 00:33:44.923]  Faith or death is what you say.
[00:33:56.807 --> 00:33:59.649]  All right, I will get into the ultra-massive news.
[00:33:59.789 --> 00:34:05.693]  And I was saying I would break down this segment because the other breaking news just came out.
[00:34:06.634 --> 00:34:16.001]  But if you just joined us, ladies and gentlemen, it is critical to know they've now confirmed that there were multiple stand downs in Parkland.
[00:34:16.642 --> 00:34:18.483]  The Sheriff's Department physically stood down.
[00:34:18.983 --> 00:34:21.365]  They were warned dozens of times, 22 times, that
[00:34:23.217 --> 00:34:25.518]  The shooter was planning to kill people.
[00:34:25.558 --> 00:34:27.638]  He was known for years as the school shooter.
[00:34:28.438 --> 00:34:38.780]  And now it's confirmed, starting in 2013, school shooter Nicholas Cruz was shielded from arrest to fight systemic racism.
[00:34:39.241 --> 00:34:43.701]  That's now in the Sun Sentinel News.
[00:34:43.782 --> 00:34:45.282]  It's now in the local television news.
[00:34:45.902 --> 00:34:49.943]  They said that the school and the county lied and said that he wasn't, but that he was.
[00:34:51.004 --> 00:34:53.005]  Because you have to fight racism.
[00:34:54.246 --> 00:35:00.971]  You cannot allow someone who has a Spanish last name to go to jail.
[00:35:02.171 --> 00:35:10.857]  And Google has also announced that they're not going to allow bails bonds ads because it's racist because minorities are in jail.
[00:35:10.937 --> 00:35:13.819]  So they shouldn't be able to find a bails bondsman.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.381]  You heard me right.
[00:35:18.424 --> 00:35:25.347]  This is the whole Black Lives Matter, don't put anybody in prison move, to virtue signal.
[00:35:25.987 --> 00:35:28.828]  And then they time and time again let the person out.
[00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:32.970]  Nicholas Cruz was adopted, he wasn't even Hispanic.
[00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.570]  This is insane!
[00:35:38.012 --> 00:35:40.373]  But that ties into Europe where they let Muslims rape people.
[00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:45.855]  I'm gonna tie it all together and then this incredible news, disinformation in the Washington Post,
[00:35:47.617 --> 00:35:59.560]  Saying that InfoWars blamed some woman for being a crisis actor and saying that she was Emma Gonzales, because her name's the same.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.541]  We never did any such thing.
[00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:07.622]  Emma Gonzales is the young shaved head girl who's an anti-gun activist.
[00:36:08.202 --> 00:36:09.523]  They just lie and say this.
[00:36:09.723 --> 00:36:10.683]  Look at this poor lady.
[00:36:10.763 --> 00:36:12.644]  Alex Jones says she's an actress.
[00:36:12.724 --> 00:36:13.684]  Total lies!
[00:36:16.089 --> 00:36:23.575]  Crisis actors did not say that, but again, they just keep retreading this, and retreading it, and retreading it, and retreading it, and retreading it.
[00:36:26.137 --> 00:36:31.542]  And I guess the media goes to this lady and tells her I said this about her, but notice they don't show me in the Washington Post saying it.
[00:36:31.782 --> 00:36:32.763]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:36:37.027 --> 00:36:44.513]  But now... The big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:46.687 --> 00:36:47.828]  This just broke minutes ago.
[00:36:47.888 --> 00:36:51.991]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com from Reuters.
[00:36:53.112 --> 00:36:55.174]  Trump tells Macron U.S.
[00:36:55.254 --> 00:36:57.996]  to pull out of Iran nuclear deal.
[00:36:59.184 --> 00:37:01.366]  New York Times is saying U.S.
[00:37:01.406 --> 00:37:10.434]  President Donald Trump told President of France Emmanuel Macron today that the United States was going to pull out of the international nuclear agreement with Iran.
[00:37:10.814 --> 00:37:14.338]  The New York Times reported, citing a person briefed on the conversation.
[00:37:14.358 --> 00:37:24.507]  The source said the United States is preparing to reinstate all sanctions it had waived as part of the deal and impose additional economic penalties, the Times reported.
[00:37:26.052 --> 00:37:29.854]  Trump is to make an announcement on the Iran deal at 2 p.m.
[00:37:30.554 --> 00:37:31.174]  coming up.
[00:37:32.155 --> 00:37:33.595]  That'll be in about an hour.
[00:37:34.095 --> 00:37:34.596]  That's 2 p.m.
[00:37:34.656 --> 00:37:34.916]  Eastern.
[00:37:35.516 --> 00:37:40.938]  One senior European official closely involved with Iran diplomacy told Reuters U.S.
[00:37:41.018 --> 00:37:49.022]  officials had indicated late on Monday that Trump would withdraw from the agreement but remained unclear on what terms and whatever sanctions would be imposed.
[00:37:50.078 --> 00:38:03.362]  The 2015 deal, signature foreign policy achievement of Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from being able to make an atomic bomb.
[00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:14.665]  Trump has frequently criticized the Iran Accord because it does not address Iran's ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025, nor its role in conflicts in Yemen and Syria.
[00:38:16.186 --> 00:38:19.407]  So we will look at all of that as it unfolds today.
[00:38:29.585 --> 00:38:43.055]  Now wait till we get to the news of the next segment, because it ties into China not letting people that criticize the government buy, sell, or trade, or leave the country, or even travel.
[00:38:43.715 --> 00:38:46.097]  Well, the UK now is officially doing this all the time.
[00:38:46.117 --> 00:38:52.121]  This is Dan Lyman's story up on EuropeWars.com, our European Bureau.
[00:38:53.002 --> 00:38:57.325]  UK bans Norwegian anti-migration activists who lives in London.
[00:38:58.888 --> 00:39:01.410]  So more and more, the travel bans are in effect.
[00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.992]  Very, very, very serious police state.
[00:39:08.294 --> 00:39:19.441]  And then coming up... The New York Observer, owned by the President's son-in-law that's so anti-Trump it makes your head spin.
[00:39:19.741 --> 00:39:21.022]  I'm not anti-Jerry Kushner!
[00:39:21.822 --> 00:39:26.165]  And I know that the company is in a blind trust now that he works in the White House, but come on, man!
[00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:29.948]  Trump's a rapist.
[00:39:30.048 --> 00:39:31.169]  Alex Jones is a criminal.
[00:39:31.209 --> 00:39:34.229]  I mean, it's one of the worst foaming at the mouth publications.
[00:39:34.689 --> 00:39:35.930]  And here they are, breathlessly.
[00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:46.572]  Hollywood warns celebrities will choose the red pill, a la Kanye, and that more are about to break out, and that we've got to do something.
[00:39:46.632 --> 00:39:50.953]  Brett Easton, Ellis, warns more celebrities will choose the red pill.
[00:39:51.473 --> 00:39:52.614]  Oh my goodness, but don't worry.
[00:39:54.234 --> 00:39:57.615]  There's a new lineup of alt-right, new right,
[00:39:58.885 --> 00:40:00.206]  That are outside the box.
[00:40:01.726 --> 00:40:05.768]  And then the New York Times has an article, Meet the Renegades of the Intellectual Dark Web.
[00:40:05.788 --> 00:40:10.630]  And it's got Ben Shapiro in here.
[00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.691]  And it calls him a prince.
[00:40:14.991 --> 00:40:17.192]  The New York Times calls him a prince.
[00:40:18.533 --> 00:40:23.415]  And it just says he is such a wonderful prince.
[00:40:26.832 --> 00:40:46.645]  It says, once IDW folks saw that people like Ben Shapiro were generally smart, highly informed, and often princely, in difficult conversations, but then meanwhile, next paragraph, that unlike Alex Jones and Mike Cernovich,
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.762]  That people don't take seriously, that there's a high probability that you're either cynical or stupid.
[00:40:54.203 --> 00:41:00.365]  See, you're cynical or stupid if you talk to Alex Jones or Mike Cernovich, but Mike Shapiro's a prince.
[00:41:00.645 --> 00:41:06.508]  You have to understand, the only thing that could hurt Infowars would be the New York Times endorsing us like this.
[00:41:07.028 --> 00:41:12.691]  I don't want to be in big color spreads and the New York Times is the reasonable thinkers.
[00:41:13.598 --> 00:41:18.940]  You know, people that are off the reservation, they're the new right, even though none of them are really even right-wing.
[00:41:19.921 --> 00:41:21.041]  And you can trust them.
[00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:21.982]  They're good.
[00:41:22.942 --> 00:41:23.903]  Jordan Peterson.
[00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:25.784]  Ben Shapiro.
[00:41:25.824 --> 00:41:28.945]  See, I've seen them everywhere pushing them as the good guys.
[00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:39.170]  They're in control now.
[00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.890]  They're the boss.
[00:41:41.701 --> 00:41:42.882]  Do as I tell you.
[00:41:42.942 --> 00:41:44.343]  You are now under my trance.
[00:41:44.703 --> 00:41:45.443]  Come to me.
[00:41:46.464 --> 00:41:47.344]  I am Ben Shapiro.
[00:41:47.385 --> 00:41:47.865]  Come to me.
[00:41:48.745 --> 00:41:51.367]  And it's just a joke how they're force-feeding the new Glenn Beck.
[00:41:52.728 --> 00:41:55.089]  And let me tell you, the second model's not even as good as the first.
[00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:59.152]  But I'm telling you, I see it everywhere.
[00:41:59.592 --> 00:42:00.393]  Jones is evil.
[00:42:00.473 --> 00:42:01.113]  Shut him down.
[00:42:01.173 --> 00:42:02.074]  He needs to be silenced.
[00:42:02.434 --> 00:42:03.955]  Ben Shapiro's a prince!
[00:42:03.975 --> 00:42:10.079]  Can you imagine if the New York Times said, Alex Jones is so smart, he's such a prince.
[00:42:11.038 --> 00:42:12.038]  And that's always the PR.
[00:42:12.158 --> 00:42:13.199]  So smart.
[00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:14.899]  So intellectual.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.380]  He said, Alex Jones is awful.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.361]  Everyone started fawning, going, oh, that's so intellectual.
[00:42:23.962 --> 00:42:24.822]  That's what I'm telling you.
[00:42:26.922 --> 00:42:29.743]  And New York Times calls me all the time, wants to do spreads and shoots.
[00:42:29.823 --> 00:42:32.724]  And I just say, nope, make up whatever you're going to make up.
[00:42:35.151 --> 00:42:35.912]  So I've learned my lesson.
[00:42:35.952 --> 00:42:38.053]  And let me tell Joe Rogan something, who's a good guy who's in this.
[00:42:38.313 --> 00:42:39.534]  He's another one of the safe guys.
[00:42:39.694 --> 00:42:41.135]  The Good New York Times says he's a good guy.
[00:42:42.176 --> 00:42:45.038]  When they're done with us, if they're successful, they're going to get you next.
[00:42:45.078 --> 00:42:46.479]  They don't like anybody that's independent.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.743]  I wouldn't spend 10 seconds being caught dead in the New York Times.
[00:42:51.823 --> 00:42:54.305]  But you can learn in this article who the good guys are.
[00:42:54.965 --> 00:42:57.167]  Thank God the New York Times says I'm a bad guy.
[00:42:57.347 --> 00:42:58.407]  And that I'm not a prince.
[00:42:58.427 --> 00:43:00.309]  Does that tell you anything you need to know about Ben Shapiro?
[00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:01.810]  The New York Times endorses him.

[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.120]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:16.543]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:45:17.336 --> 00:45:23.900]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.261]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[00:45:26.361 --> 00:45:26.761]  Thank you.
[00:45:27.422 --> 00:45:29.903]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[00:45:29.923 --> 00:45:33.665]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[00:45:34.246 --> 00:45:37.207]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:38.228]  They are quality.
[00:45:38.588 --> 00:45:39.829]  I can't wait to get some more.
[00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:43.051]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:43.771]  Absolutely.
[00:45:43.931 --> 00:45:57.179]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:46:01.922 --> 00:46:03.923]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:46:04.003 --> 00:46:04.323]  Go ahead.
[00:46:04.604 --> 00:46:06.805]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:46:06.825 --> 00:46:09.867]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:46:10.692 --> 00:46:11.793]  It just gets old, man.
[00:46:12.113 --> 00:46:13.835]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:46:14.536 --> 00:46:16.598]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:46:16.858 --> 00:46:20.862]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:46:20.882 --> 00:46:23.364]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:46:24.185 --> 00:46:26.507]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:27.968]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:46:28.229 --> 00:46:29.110]  Us being shut down?
[00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.371]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:46:30.811 --> 00:46:31.852]  You know what, Alex?
[00:46:31.892 --> 00:46:32.973]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:46:32.993 --> 00:46:33.794]  Hey, Frank!
[00:46:34.094 --> 00:46:39.378]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:46:39.678 --> 00:46:43.962]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:46:44.202 --> 00:46:47.064]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:46:47.325 --> 00:46:47.705]  You understand?
[00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:49.066]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:46:49.446 --> 00:46:50.567]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:46:51.548 --> 00:46:56.472]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[00:46:56.913 --> 00:46:57.854]  Do you understand?
[00:46:57.874 --> 00:46:59.115]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:46:59.515 --> 00:47:01.036]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:08.423]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.452]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:48:01.572 --> 00:48:03.034]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:48:06.576 --> 00:48:11.941]  We are going to get into an incredible miscarriage of justice.
[00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:23.991]  An outrageous crime committed against the young men and women of Parkland High School in Florida on Valentine's Day 2018.
[00:48:25.772 --> 00:48:32.637]  It is now confirmed, it is now even mainstream news that the Sheriff's Department
[00:48:33.533 --> 00:48:46.942]  Not one deputy, not four deputies, but more than 15 deputies stood down just as witnesses that day and the day after on our broadcast said they witnessed.
[00:48:47.923 --> 00:48:58.089]  We had one witness on, a young African-American man, and Snopes said he was an actor from another city that I had on my show.
[00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:00.151]  Days later they had to remove it.
[00:49:01.172 --> 00:49:03.033]  So they're doing what I said
[00:49:05.652 --> 00:49:09.914]  They're doing what they claim I do.
[00:49:11.775 --> 00:49:14.717]  They're doing what they say I did but didn't do.
[00:49:16.418 --> 00:49:21.181]  Now here's the big breaking news that just makes me so angry I can hardly talk.
[00:49:21.401 --> 00:49:22.942]  Not because they're demonizing me.
[00:49:23.022 --> 00:49:24.603]  Not because they're trying to destroy my name.
[00:49:25.183 --> 00:49:26.724]  I signed up for this to hit the bar bar.
[00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:31.066]  But because they think you're so stupid and I don't know what to do.
[00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:33.748]  Because they need to be punished for it.
[00:49:36.271 --> 00:49:42.093]  And I'm going to get to what they're doing to Infowars and the American people in just a moment, but first let's get into what they did to those students that day.
[00:49:43.353 --> 00:49:44.133]  They stood down.
[00:49:46.254 --> 00:49:51.956]  And now, the Sun Sentinel and two local TV stations have the documents.
[00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:57.677]  There's an excellent article by Chris Minahan on InformationLiberation.com.
[00:49:58.198 --> 00:49:59.938]  It's posted on Infowars.com.
[00:50:01.619 --> 00:50:02.219]  Confirmed!
[00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:14.954]  School shooter Nicholas Cruz was shielded from arrest to fight systemic racism all over the country in blue cities that already have the highest crime rates by far.
[00:50:15.414 --> 00:50:27.959]  Everyone knows Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, Maryland, D.C., Miami, L.A., Oakland.
[00:50:28.159 --> 00:50:28.819]  You want me to stop?
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.300]  Everybody knows that.
[00:50:31.923 --> 00:50:33.904]  Houston's Blue City, really bad crime.
[00:50:35.785 --> 00:50:40.967]  So confirmed, school shooter Nicholas Cruz was shielded from arrest to fight systemic racism.
[00:50:41.087 --> 00:50:41.947]  That's close quote.
[00:50:43.988 --> 00:50:51.211]  Not only did they shield him from arrest in the name of fighting racism, they didn't even force him to go to their worthless program.
[00:50:54.032 --> 00:50:56.413]  He was known at the school as the school shooter.
[00:50:58.416 --> 00:51:13.471]  School shooter Nicholas Cruz was protected from arrest by Broward County School District officials thanks to a controversial disciplinary program, close quote, designed to combat systemic racism, close quote, by limiting arrest of minority students.
[00:51:13.491 --> 00:51:16.975]  So his last name was Cruz, even though he was a white guy adopted.
[00:51:20.723 --> 00:51:26.969]  And so, he couldn't get in trouble threatening to kill everybody on a routine basis, and the police have been called 22 times.
[00:51:26.989 --> 00:51:30.972]  And they go, oh no, it was only three times.
[00:51:31.052 --> 00:51:33.695]  Or, oh no, he wasn't in this program.
[00:51:33.995 --> 00:51:34.455]  Remember that?
[00:51:36.557 --> 00:51:38.499]  Well, it turns out, he was in the program.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:45.906]  Broward County School District officials lied repeatedly for months by claiming otherwise from WJCT Television.
[00:51:47.148 --> 00:52:00.838]  Rowan County District officials admitted Sunday, took two days for us to learn this, that the confessed Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School gunman was assigned to a controversial disciplinary program after the superintendent repeatedly claimed Nicholas Cruz had no connection.
[00:52:00.858 --> 00:52:05.301]  Remember the Project Veritas videos of the school officials in New Jersey?
[00:52:05.321 --> 00:52:08.964]  Saying, oh yeah, they rape girls, they do everything, we love them, it's no big deal.
[00:52:09.484 --> 00:52:13.207]  To the alternative punishment designed to limit on-campus arrest.
[00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:27.287]  Two sources with knowledge of Cruz's discipline records told WLRN he was referred to the so-called Promise Program for a three-day stint after committing vandalism at West Glades Middle School in 2013.
[00:52:27.687 --> 00:52:34.830]  And then it goes on that he was put back in it repeatedly for all the different threats and vandalization and threatening to kill people.
[00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:36.151]  It goes on for page after page.
[00:52:36.451 --> 00:52:37.631]  All the news reports, everything.
[00:52:40.953 --> 00:52:42.254]  Here are some of the individual headlines.
[00:52:42.334 --> 00:52:42.954]  Sun Sentinel.
[00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:47.477]  What's the future of Broward County's Promise Program?
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.822]  After news Nicholas Cruz was referred there.
[00:52:53.382 --> 00:52:56.185]  And it goes on to say the news said it wasn't true, they were lying.
[00:52:56.545 --> 00:52:57.226]  Sun Sentinel.
[00:52:57.346 --> 00:52:57.626]  Boom.
[00:53:00.969 --> 00:53:01.569]  Here's another one.
[00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:07.234]  Stoneman Douglas Shooter was assigned a controversial Broward Discipline Program, school officials admit.
[00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:10.537]  Here's another one.
[00:53:10.998 --> 00:53:12.499]  So, there's all the articles.
[00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:18.783]  Mark Rubio has chined in saying he was lied to about that by school officials.
[00:53:19.844 --> 00:53:21.785]  The whole boildown is on Infowars.com.
[00:53:21.805 --> 00:53:23.005]  Dana Loesch has tweeted about it.
[00:53:23.426 --> 00:53:27.188]  The Broward School District repeatedly lied to parents, students, and us.
[00:53:28.288 --> 00:53:34.912]  When the NRA TV questioned them whether the Parkland murder was in the Promise Program, he was.
[00:53:34.972 --> 00:53:37.774]  The school and sheriff, Israel, who championed this program,
[00:53:39.457 --> 00:53:39.917]  Are liable.
[00:53:41.138 --> 00:53:41.499]  Bingo.
[00:53:41.979 --> 00:53:42.519]  And they lied.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:44.281]  Now, that ties into Google.
[00:53:44.301 --> 00:53:45.021]  This is just today.
[00:53:45.102 --> 00:53:55.190]  Bans bail bonds ads from the entire platform, The Hill Reports, saying bails bondsmen are racist because a lot of the people they bail out are black or hispanic.
[00:53:57.251 --> 00:54:01.535]  It's like if your last name's Cruz, you're threatening to kill everybody, you're vandalizing, sorry.
[00:54:02.015 --> 00:54:03.656]  You know, we can't ever stop you.
[00:54:03.696 --> 00:54:04.577]  We have to stand down.
[00:54:05.117 --> 00:54:06.739]  We have to stand down physically that day.
[00:54:08.407 --> 00:54:10.029]  This looks pretty premeditated, doesn't it?
[00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:11.170]  They didn't do the shooting.
[00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:12.411]  They didn't have crisis actors.
[00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:13.272]  We never said that.
[00:54:13.392 --> 00:54:14.153]  The media lied.
[00:54:15.354 --> 00:54:17.336]  We said they stood down with witnesses.
[00:54:17.677 --> 00:54:19.899]  Those are the videos YouTube took down.
[00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:23.523]  Those were the videos CNN said they wanted down and they misrepresented.
[00:54:25.199 --> 00:54:30.804]  Google announced today it would no longer allow bail bonds companies to buy advertisements on its ad platforms.
[00:54:31.304 --> 00:54:40.352]  The company explained its decision was based on research showing that for-profit bail bonds providers make most of revenue from communities of color and low-income neighborhoods.
[00:54:40.692 --> 00:54:42.513]  Notice color and low-income neighborhoods.
[00:54:42.914 --> 00:54:45.956]  When they are at their most vulnerable.
[00:54:46.157 --> 00:54:47.598]  Okay, we'll just stay in jail then.
[00:54:48.198 --> 00:54:49.179]  But again, it's this whole thing.
[00:54:49.239 --> 00:54:52.422]  Don't go after people that commit crimes unless they're white.
[00:54:53.806 --> 00:54:54.407]  And here it is.
[00:54:54.787 --> 00:54:59.370]  France, 87-year-old woman raped for two hours by newly arrived Moroccan migrant.
[00:55:02.453 --> 00:55:07.197]  Sex between a 23-year-old migrant and a 10-year-old girl is not rape, says Finland's High Court.
[00:55:07.477 --> 00:55:09.398]  Says Muslims are allowed to rape your children.
[00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:10.679]  That's mainstream news.
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.863]  Sweden, 88% of gang rapists have migrant background.
[00:55:18.045 --> 00:55:20.187]  Police won't give description of rapists in Sweden.
[00:55:22.159 --> 00:55:23.359]  It's now against the law.
[00:55:24.139 --> 00:55:27.860]  Paris mayor backs Communist Party plan to turn public park into migrant camp.
[00:55:28.801 --> 00:55:31.381]  Swedish child raped by three men on her way home.
[00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.922]  Police refuse to give description of the perpetrators.
[00:55:35.622 --> 00:55:36.402]  Heard of this before?
[00:55:36.462 --> 00:55:39.583]  Bring in the foreign invaders, then make them above the law.
[00:55:40.423 --> 00:55:41.423]  Gun-free Britain.
[00:55:42.384 --> 00:55:45.104]  Four shootings in 48 hours in Sadiq Khan's London.
[00:55:47.525 --> 00:55:48.085]  On and on and on.
[00:55:49.244 --> 00:55:50.624]  I've got other interesting news out of Europe.
[00:55:50.985 --> 00:55:52.285]  Single-payer NHS.
[00:55:52.325 --> 00:55:53.925]  The girl has one leg shorter than the other.
[00:55:54.326 --> 00:55:55.626]  She wanted a surgery to fix it.
[00:55:55.646 --> 00:55:57.566]  They said, no, we'll just chop your leg off.
[00:55:57.606 --> 00:55:59.607]  Oh yeah, they got a lot of doctors in Cuba, too.
[00:56:00.087 --> 00:56:02.348]  If you're blind, they don't give you a cornea surgery.
[00:56:02.928 --> 00:56:04.629]  If you have cataracts, they just give you a cane.
[00:56:06.249 --> 00:56:07.169]  Now that's happening there.
[00:56:07.189 --> 00:56:09.470]  But let me bring you this little snippet of information.
[00:56:12.751 --> 00:56:14.932]  People think she's a Parkland crisis actor.
[00:56:15.032 --> 00:56:15.892]  It's terrifying.
[00:56:17.196 --> 00:56:28.922]  And then it says they learned from Alex Jones that Emma Jane Gonzalez was a crisis actor and was Emma Gonzalez the shaved head anti-gun girl.
[00:56:29.422 --> 00:56:33.104]  And you read the article, it just says Alex Jones says she's an actress.
[00:56:33.244 --> 00:56:35.125]  Alex Jones says that she's a crisis actor.
[00:56:35.385 --> 00:56:36.026]  That's where they did it.
[00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:36.786]  Never said it.
[00:56:36.846 --> 00:56:37.787]  Never saw this woman.
[00:56:38.007 --> 00:56:39.147]  None of my writers ever said it.
[00:56:39.307 --> 00:56:41.989]  They don't show where I said this in the Washington Post.
[00:56:43.932 --> 00:56:47.293]  This is how Jeff Bezos strikes back, the guy that owns it.
[00:56:48.093 --> 00:56:48.593]  Amazon.
[00:56:49.253 --> 00:56:50.834]  Yes, you know, I go protest Amazon.
[00:56:51.394 --> 00:56:52.774]  And so now this is what he does to me.
[00:56:53.334 --> 00:56:54.955]  I've never talked about this woman.
[00:56:55.035 --> 00:56:56.315]  I didn't say they were crisis actors.
[00:56:56.595 --> 00:57:02.917]  I didn't say this woman in another city, who's 30-something years old, was the real Emma Gonzalez, who I'm not saying is a crisis actor.
[00:57:03.157 --> 00:57:03.857]  They don't care!
[00:57:04.337 --> 00:57:06.018]  They say I'm brutalizing a woman.
[00:57:06.118 --> 00:57:07.018]  I'm a bad person.
[00:57:07.118 --> 00:57:07.558]  I'm evil.
[00:57:08.755 --> 00:57:09.776]  And they're never going to stop.
[00:57:09.816 --> 00:57:10.556]  That'll be the new thing.
[00:57:10.816 --> 00:57:12.818]  He said an innocent woman was Emma Gonzalez.
[00:57:13.238 --> 00:57:18.322]  That's the fraud of the mainstream media, Washington Post.
[00:57:18.382 --> 00:57:26.827]  I'm going to contact this woman and say, ma'am, please come on the show and please show me where any of my people or any of us ever said you were a crisis actor because
[00:57:27.728 --> 00:57:32.612]  You could say that I questioned Sandy Hook, and then later said, I guess it's official story's right.
[00:57:32.872 --> 00:57:35.094]  Then they just retread that and say, I'm still saying it didn't happen.
[00:57:35.274 --> 00:57:37.035]  But with this, I didn't say that ever.
[00:57:37.415 --> 00:57:43.420]  And it's a fraud on me, and a way to then sit there and demonize InfoWars and probably gear up some new lawsuit.
[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:51.606]  We'll be right back with the second hour, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, 50% off for a limited time on our fluoride-free toothpaste, Super Blue.
[00:57:52.791 --> 00:57:59.772]  Every week we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[00:58:00.192 --> 00:58:06.573]  We're on well over a hundred stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:13.055]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is PhonoScope.
[00:58:14.135 --> 00:58:20.876]  PhonoScope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming
[00:58:21.874 --> 00:58:23.355]  Television over phone lines.
[00:58:23.635 --> 00:58:25.796]  That's why it's called Phonoscope and why it's patented.
[00:58:26.297 --> 00:58:32.160]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[00:58:33.121 --> 00:58:37.543]  On Phonoscope, channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[00:58:38.144 --> 00:58:42.406]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[00:58:42.947 --> 00:58:44.187]  This is very, very exciting.
[00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:47.890]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:57.734]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope.
[00:58:58.114 --> 00:59:10.019]  Not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[00:59:10.479 --> 00:59:13.140]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.643]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[00:59:17.663 --> 00:59:19.705]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:35.957]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into Phonoscope and to also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[00:59:36.517 --> 00:59:36.858]  So again,
[00:59:37.358 --> 00:59:42.343]  From myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[00:59:42.863 --> 00:59:44.364]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[00:59:44.645 --> 00:59:46.286]  You've helped make America great again.
[00:59:47.687 --> 00:59:51.671]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:56.635 --> 01:00:00.579]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:17.667]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:00:19.328 --> 01:00:24.413]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:33.762]  Alright, I want to quantify something right now, then I'm going to get into huge breaking news on the Iran deal.
[01:00:33.802 --> 01:00:35.123]  Trump saying he's pulling out of that.
[01:00:35.923 --> 01:00:42.487]  The latest on one of the Me Too movement leaders reportedly calling women brown slaves and beating them savagely during sex.
[01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:45.689]  The New York Attorney General, that's all coming up.
[01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:49.163]  I got a small correction to make here in a moment as well.
[01:00:49.884 --> 01:00:55.307]  I had read that Jared Kushner still was in a foundation with the Observer that's always attacking Trump.
[01:00:55.808 --> 01:00:58.269]  Turns out a year ago, he totally divested from it.
[01:00:58.529 --> 01:01:00.551]  So, thanks to the crew for pointing that out to me.
[01:01:00.811 --> 01:01:02.412]  Well good, I said I'm not against Kushner.
[01:01:02.432 --> 01:01:04.053]  It didn't make sense, so there you go.
[01:01:04.473 --> 01:01:06.054]  The Observer used to be more conservative.
[01:01:06.074 --> 01:01:07.435]  It's just pure garbage.
[01:01:07.695 --> 01:01:08.576]  Anyways, I digress.
[01:01:11.878 --> 01:01:13.399]  Let me explain what happened with Sandy Hook.
[01:01:14.198 --> 01:01:19.602]  Dr. Steve Pucinich did run psychological operations for the State Department.
[01:01:19.922 --> 01:01:21.563]  He ran major CIA operations.
[01:01:22.003 --> 01:01:25.006]  He's on record in the New York Times overthrowing major governments.
[01:01:25.286 --> 01:01:26.927]  He co-authored a bunch of books for Clancy.
[01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:28.228]  He was one of his main sources.
[01:01:29.909 --> 01:01:32.070]  He said the whole thing was staged from his sources.
[01:01:32.671 --> 01:01:34.012]  He says he had meetings with generals.
[01:01:34.032 --> 01:01:35.533]  He used to be high-level CFR.
[01:01:35.593 --> 01:01:37.674]  He was saying 9-11 was a stand-down.
[01:01:38.175 --> 01:01:39.836]  A lot of that came out later in 28 Pages.
[01:01:40.316 --> 01:01:41.277]  He said it was staged.
[01:01:41.657 --> 01:01:42.518]  There were anomalies.
[01:01:43.644 --> 01:01:45.346]  I questioned it, I have a right to do that.
[01:01:46.227 --> 01:01:47.369]  I looked at both sides.
[01:01:47.489 --> 01:01:51.734]  Paul Watson got really mad at me, and we have the emails, I've shown these on air.
[01:01:51.754 --> 01:02:01.847]  Aaron Dykes, a good reporter here at the time, he thought it was a load of crap to say nobody died, and that we couldn't say for sure, so that I shouldn't even question it.
[01:02:02.483 --> 01:02:08.148]  And I would have arguments about babies in incubators in Iraq, and they lied about that to get us into war, so I thought it was okay to question.
[01:02:08.468 --> 01:02:13.292]  But once you saw the parents and all the stuff out there, I started saying, no, you know, they come off as real.
[01:02:14.233 --> 01:02:16.375]  But I have under the First Amendment my right to doubt anything.
[01:02:17.075 --> 01:02:19.677]  I can be a crazy person that doubts that the Empire States Building exists.
[01:02:20.078 --> 01:02:25.282]  The media saw that about three and a half years ago as weakness, and thought, wait, Jones is backtracked on Sandy Hook.
[01:02:26.323 --> 01:02:29.125]  So they built their whole Democratic Party system on it.
[01:02:29.286 --> 01:02:30.827]  Hillary ran ads against me with it.
[01:02:31.954 --> 01:02:32.355]  You name it.
[01:02:32.895 --> 01:02:34.477]  Well, all's fair in love and war.
[01:02:35.038 --> 01:02:41.947]  They could halfway argue that I said some of that before, so they can say that now, even though I've said that I don't believe that now.
[01:02:42.908 --> 01:02:45.371]  And I did believe it at the time, and then I changed my mind.
[01:02:45.712 --> 01:02:46.353]  And I had that right.
[01:02:48.336 --> 01:03:03.526]  But what I will not put up with and what has really fed me up is CNN saying that I said nobody died at Parkland and that the four students they chose out of the 3,000 who were anti-gunners were crisis actors.
[01:03:03.967 --> 01:03:08.109]  I said they were chosen because they were in the drama department that was also anti-gun and well-spoken.
[01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:10.491]  And they said that themselves in interviews.
[01:03:10.531 --> 01:03:11.251]  That's why I said that.
[01:03:11.612 --> 01:03:12.712]  So they conflated that.
[01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:15.093]  I said there was a police stand down.
[01:03:15.473 --> 01:03:19.134]  That's what they took down of my videos on YouTube.
[01:03:19.494 --> 01:03:20.235]  And almost banned us.
[01:03:20.255 --> 01:03:27.777]  But when we put the videos back up, people got to see them for themselves, and they got to watch it for themselves.
[01:03:27.797 --> 01:03:29.917]  They said that had nothing to do with that, and Jones didn't say that.
[01:03:30.277 --> 01:03:34.118]  So, even Bloomberg said it was done wrongly, my stuff was put back up.
[01:03:35.098 --> 01:03:41.600]  Well, now the Washington Post, owned by the guy that made $12 billion in one week, two weeks ago, Jeff Bezos, richest man in the world,
[01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:46.213]  Runs an article saying people think she's a Parkland crisis actor.
[01:03:46.373 --> 01:03:47.154]  It's terrifying.
[01:03:47.934 --> 01:03:49.455]  And her name is Emma Jane Gonzalez.
[01:03:50.156 --> 01:03:56.560]  They'll probably have the, you know, the opposition or something edit this together and play it where I'm saying she is an actor or crisis actor.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.081]  I've never seen this woman.
[01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.282]  We never said they were crisis actors.
[01:04:00.322 --> 01:04:01.183]  We said it happened.
[01:04:01.443 --> 01:04:03.384]  We said there was a stand down, which is now proven.
[01:04:04.825 --> 01:04:09.048]  And it just says in here, in the article, they learned about it from Alex Jones.
[01:04:10.691 --> 01:04:13.072]  Who's being sued for saying Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[01:04:13.672 --> 01:04:17.054]  And it just says that they learned that this lady's a crisis actor for me.
[01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:18.214]  No, they didn't!
[01:04:18.534 --> 01:04:19.755]  They don't show where I said it.
[01:04:19.975 --> 01:04:20.795]  There's no text.
[01:04:20.935 --> 01:04:24.297]  It is a known lie to launch this whole new thing.
[01:04:24.797 --> 01:04:27.838]  And because I'm decrying it, they go, oh look, we got him on this, keep doing it.
[01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.539]  No, you're discrediting yourselves.
[01:04:29.859 --> 01:04:31.360]  This is the real Emma Gonzalez.
[01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:36.002]  Who's an anti-gun activist and now turned herself into a celebrity on this, okay?
[01:04:36.022 --> 01:04:37.503]  Blaming gun owners for what happened.
[01:04:37.703 --> 01:04:39.684]  This is the real girl that she was 17 years old.
[01:04:40.144 --> 01:04:43.966]  Not the 30-something-year-old Emma Jane Gonzalez, who is not that woman.
[01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:45.446]  So I'm not correcting this.
[01:04:45.546 --> 01:04:48.468]  I'm correcting the Washington Post that knows full well it's lying.
[01:04:50.229 --> 01:04:51.209]  I'm gonna tell you right now.
[01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:54.971]  Everybody's got to boycott Amazon.
[01:04:55.011 --> 01:04:56.132]  They are out of control.
[01:04:56.152 --> 01:04:59.093]  They are a cancer and Trump needs to break it up.
[01:04:59.553 --> 01:05:01.134]  Bezos is a sweatshop owner.
[01:05:04.456 --> 01:05:05.196]  I'm so excited.
[01:05:05.256 --> 01:05:13.386]  The new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top.
[01:05:13.846 --> 01:05:14.847]  The Real Red Pill.
[01:05:15.408 --> 01:05:17.510]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[01:05:18.371 --> 01:05:23.695]  A nootropic doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[01:05:23.915 --> 01:05:32.661]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:05:34.802 --> 01:05:39.585]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:05:40.106 --> 01:05:42.868]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:53.895]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:05:54.396 --> 01:05:55.696]  It is amazing!
[01:05:57.077 --> 01:06:02.061]  Red Pill, now available at infowarsstore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[01:06:15.902 --> 01:06:18.004]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:18.504 --> 01:06:19.946]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.432]  Well, we've got an incredibly full plate here.
[01:06:29.694 --> 01:06:36.280]  Best-selling author and researcher, William Engdahl, is going to be joining us.
[01:06:37.429 --> 01:06:49.175]  Coming up, at the bottom of the hour, we'll then have open phones today in the third hour on this live Tuesday, the eighth day already of May 2018.
[01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:52.697]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:53.478 --> 01:06:56.579]  I got a bunch of clips I want to get to, a bunch of U.S.
[01:06:56.619 --> 01:07:02.122]  news, a bunch of propaganda out of Hollywood news, a bunch of police state news.
[01:07:03.383 --> 01:07:06.885]  There's just so much, but before I do that,
[01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:13.620]  I want to hit two stories in particular and then go to these clips.
[01:07:17.342 --> 01:07:34.293]  There's a story up on Infowars.com from LouderWithCrowder.com that is so important because it links directly through to the London Telegraph and other publications.
[01:07:34.393 --> 01:07:38.176]  So when you hear this, this is really
[01:07:40.754 --> 01:07:41.314]  Going on.
[01:07:44.055 --> 01:07:45.016]  This is really happening.
[01:07:49.037 --> 01:07:56.620]  Single-payer NHS recommends amputation instead of treatment for girl's leg.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:06.264]  Now, all of us have experienced, I think, leftists in their fantasy land where their brain is up in cloud cuckoo world.
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:10.061]  Tell us, we all deserve free health care like England.
[01:08:10.161 --> 01:08:11.222]  It's the best in the world.
[01:08:11.502 --> 01:08:14.824]  Or, Cuba's got more doctors per capita than anybody.
[01:08:15.204 --> 01:08:17.325]  They're incredible and their education's free.
[01:08:19.587 --> 01:08:21.628]  Or, man, Canada's got great health care.
[01:08:22.208 --> 01:08:29.392]  But then if you actually know people and you actually research, you know that Canadians, about half of them, choose to come to the U.S.
[01:08:29.412 --> 01:08:30.132]  for their health care.
[01:08:30.493 --> 01:08:34.195]  You learn the NHS will give you, for strep throat,
[01:08:35.197 --> 01:08:42.899]  A package of Alka-Seltzer and Tylenol, because it's eugenics-based, until you go home and get over it.
[01:08:43.439 --> 01:08:51.821]  You have to get the NHS's then approval to be referred to a private doctor in a secondary healthcare scheme.
[01:08:53.981 --> 01:08:57.562]  The NHS also heats its buildings with dead babies' bodies.
[01:08:57.982 --> 01:08:59.683]  If you're a new listener, that sounds insane.
[01:08:59.723 --> 01:09:00.363]  Just look it up.
[01:09:00.403 --> 01:09:01.043]  I'm not joking.
[01:09:03.224 --> 01:09:03.744]  I remember
[01:09:04.861 --> 01:09:07.744]  When I was in high school, I was a C-Span junkie.
[01:09:07.764 --> 01:09:10.606]  It was like a soap opera for me.
[01:09:10.626 --> 01:09:11.387]  I was really into it.
[01:09:11.427 --> 01:09:14.350]  The Waco hearings came a few years after, all that.
[01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:21.777]  And I would watch Parliament Prime Minister's Questions that aired several times a week, live and then taped.
[01:09:22.998 --> 01:09:28.904]  I remember watching, even before Tony Blair, but then Tony Blair as well later, would sit up there
[01:09:32.737 --> 01:09:43.135]  And they would have Prime Minister's questions, and every third or fourth question was, this individual had an operable tumor, if you operate within six months, 95% success rate.
[01:09:43.656 --> 01:09:46.220]  This, but then waited 18 months and died.
[01:09:47.304 --> 01:09:52.929]  And then this little boy, Jimmy, had a brain tumor, or another tumor, and if he would have had surgery, he would have been taken care of.
[01:09:53.049 --> 01:10:04.459]  Or this little girl had a congenital heart defect that was 100% operable, but you have to get it in the first year because as they grow, the hole in the heart gets bigger and causes death, and she died.
[01:10:04.879 --> 01:10:07.781]  And he would hop up from his chair, because they ask the question, you stand up,
[01:10:08.482 --> 01:10:10.503]  When you're getting asked the question, you sit down.
[01:10:10.543 --> 01:10:13.804]  So you would stand up, sit down, stand up and sit down and say, Yes, I agree.
[01:10:13.824 --> 01:10:15.104]  We need more funding for NHS.
[01:10:15.545 --> 01:10:16.805]  No one is saying this is OK.
[01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:19.566]  We still have the best system in the world, but it's despicable that it's happening.
[01:10:20.526 --> 01:10:30.370]  So I remember watching that and then going to college and then being in the media and always hearing the NHS in England is the gold standard of the planet.
[01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:36.012]  Over and over and over and over again.
[01:10:38.476 --> 01:10:41.057]  And they tell them, oh, be proud of what we have, we're the best.
[01:10:41.477 --> 01:10:42.737]  And it's also eugenics-based.
[01:10:42.777 --> 01:10:46.038]  If they say you drink too much or you smoked ever, sorry, you don't get healthcare.
[01:10:46.058 --> 01:10:46.659]  And it goes on and on.
[01:10:46.819 --> 01:10:51.640]  Because once everything's pooled, well, we shouldn't pay for somebody that didn't live their life right.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:54.361]  Even if that person paid even more taxes, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:54.501 --> 01:10:56.022]  Everything's in a file, everything's tracked.
[01:10:58.222 --> 01:11:00.923]  So, what did this little girl get denied?
[01:11:01.764 --> 01:11:06.105]  She had one leg shorter than the other, and there's a corrective surgery,
[01:11:08.106 --> 01:11:10.027]  So she wouldn't have to wear a big boot.
[01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:14.150]  For her club foot, basically.
[01:11:16.211 --> 01:11:20.014]  And they told her, we'll just chop your leg off in an official document.
[01:11:21.615 --> 01:11:27.138]  And that's always the joke in Cuba, where they do have more doctors than anybody per capita.
[01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:27.638]  It's a joke.
[01:11:28.239 --> 01:11:29.720]  You're getting cataracts?
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:30.320]  Get a cane.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.401]  Your knee goes out?
[01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:31.941]  Get a cane.
[01:11:32.201 --> 01:11:33.202]  The joke is, get a cane.
[01:11:35.996 --> 01:11:40.339]  Single-payer NHS recommends amputation instead of treatment for a girl's leg.
[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:42.740]  What, she have gangrene?
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.821]  Too far gone?
[01:11:44.241 --> 01:11:44.461]  No.
[01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:45.442]  She have a tumor?
[01:11:45.522 --> 01:11:45.742]  No.
[01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:50.225]  So much for NHS being the envy of the world.
[01:11:53.447 --> 01:12:01.092]  In our continuing coverage of the UK's healthcare system screwing over kids, I give you this little gal's tale.
[01:12:02.008 --> 01:12:07.571]  This British lass has a deformity which makes one of her legs much shorter than the other.
[01:12:07.811 --> 01:12:09.672]  Yeah, one of my legs is about an inch shorter.
[01:12:09.692 --> 01:12:11.672]  Maybe mine should be chopped off.
[01:12:12.813 --> 01:12:15.614]  She went to the NHS to have them fix her.
[01:12:16.575 --> 01:12:18.396]  They wanted to chop her leg off.
[01:12:18.696 --> 01:12:19.996]  And it links to mainstream news.
[01:12:20.016 --> 01:12:22.057]  In fact, put it on screen and click on that for folks.
[01:12:22.858 --> 01:12:23.478]  For TV viewers.
[01:12:23.978 --> 01:12:25.399]  A schoolgirl with one leg
[01:12:29.096 --> 01:12:33.518]  Shorter than the other, has been told by the NHS her only option is amputation.
[01:12:34.739 --> 01:12:38.081]  Even though it's a $6,000 surgery in the US.
[01:12:38.661 --> 01:12:52.409]  However, a leading US surgeon claims UK doctors have the training, but not the confidence to save her limb by lengthening it, and that the NHS lacks the highly specialist rehabilitation services she needs after surgery.
[01:12:53.009 --> 01:12:57.632]  Dr. Dror Paley has told the parents of 7-year-old Kyra Warren.
[01:12:58.783 --> 01:13:03.346]  She wouldn't even have to limp once her leg lengthening surgeries are complete.
[01:13:03.366 --> 01:13:05.227]  Seems it's getting harder every day to get a leg up in the UK.
[01:13:25.029 --> 01:13:27.430]  So again, that's the one in Telegraph, Daily Mail, you name it.
[01:13:27.710 --> 01:13:28.430]  And we're showing video.
[01:13:28.510 --> 01:13:32.951]  Let's show video of this little girl that just needs three or four inches added to her leg.
[01:13:33.511 --> 01:13:34.632]  They go into her thigh bone.
[01:13:35.392 --> 01:13:37.712]  They'd add a synthetic bone.
[01:13:37.752 --> 01:13:39.613]  They can even laboratory grow bones now.
[01:13:40.573 --> 01:13:41.813]  Or they could add a cadaver bone.
[01:13:43.254 --> 01:13:44.254]  She needs four inches.
[01:13:45.374 --> 01:13:47.435]  But no, we'll just chop your leg off.
[01:13:47.475 --> 01:13:51.376]  Because as we get better science, better technology, we get less for the people.
[01:13:52.639 --> 01:13:54.401]  Paul Joseph Watson's upper middle class.
[01:13:54.761 --> 01:13:57.163]  He's not rich, but you know, he's paid well.
[01:13:57.443 --> 01:13:57.964]  He deserves it.
[01:13:59.665 --> 01:14:01.387]  16 years, you know, loyal fighter in the Info War.
[01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:06.792]  And again, three years ago, he had strep throat, coughing up blood for three weeks.
[01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:08.553]  He was off air for two weeks.
[01:14:09.254 --> 01:14:10.055]  Couldn't hardly talk.
[01:14:10.933 --> 01:14:13.234]  And he said, I've been to the NHS six times.
[01:14:13.354 --> 01:14:14.194]  He's talked about it on air.
[01:14:14.214 --> 01:14:18.656]  He said, they keep giving me these little packages of Alka-Seltzers and Tylenol.
[01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.897]  And he goes, Alex, I'm getting scared.
[01:14:21.138 --> 01:14:24.819]  They won't refer me, I think they're discriminating against me, to a private physician.
[01:14:25.039 --> 01:14:27.040]  They would not give him antibiotics.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.981]  They would not, they would not do it.
[01:14:30.282 --> 01:14:31.682]  Anybody's ever had strep throat, folks?
[01:14:31.962 --> 01:14:34.183]  Huge, rotting, bloody holes in the back of your throat.
[01:14:34.564 --> 01:14:37.285]  You get it, you want antibiotics in hours.
[01:14:38.996 --> 01:14:40.798]  I'm the type that's lazy and won't go to a clinic.
[01:14:40.858 --> 01:14:43.701]  You know it's really hurting kind of during the day and by the time at 3 a.m.
[01:14:43.721 --> 01:14:48.105]  you wake up and man it hurts so bad you can't even swallow and you're coughing blood up.
[01:14:48.986 --> 01:14:49.387]  Watson!
[01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:53.968]  Basically started crying on the phone.
[01:14:53.988 --> 01:14:56.050]  He's a very stoic guy, like, it hurts bad.
[01:14:57.611 --> 01:14:58.672]  I'm gonna ruin it.
[01:14:58.752 --> 01:14:59.573]  And I was like, that's it.
[01:14:59.613 --> 01:15:00.273]  What's your phone number?
[01:15:00.293 --> 01:15:00.814]  I'm gonna call him.
[01:15:01.234 --> 01:15:03.336]  And he's not the type that talks about that kind of stuff.
[01:15:03.656 --> 01:15:05.457]  That's what it's like to live in the UK.
[01:15:05.877 --> 01:15:09.841]  Almost a month with bloody strep throat would have probably killed him!
[01:15:14.204 --> 01:15:15.105]  You got strep throat?
[01:15:15.145 --> 01:15:15.645]  Go die!
[01:15:17.006 --> 01:15:18.547]  You need your leg lengthened four inches?
[01:15:18.767 --> 01:15:19.328]  Cut it off!
[01:15:20.342 --> 01:15:29.228]  And man, every time one of you slack-jawed, skinny-jeans, rich little punk kids tell me about Bernie Sanders or how great the UK is, you people are idiots!
[01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:31.590]  I'm not talking to our general audience.
[01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:40.495]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor unless they're poor kids going to community college and my wife swindled it for millions.
[01:15:40.856 --> 01:15:42.357]  That's what we commies do!
[01:15:42.697 --> 01:15:43.738]  We're predators!
[01:15:44.098 --> 01:15:45.239]  All the studies show it.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:50.102]  Hey, but you people have bleeding hearts and I can punch their buttons.
[01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:53.444]  Yeah, I'm Bernie Sanders.
[01:15:53.524 --> 01:15:55.225]  I go to Cuba for health care.
[01:15:55.805 --> 01:15:59.087]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I'll sell you too.
[01:15:59.707 --> 01:16:01.488]  You dumb, you dumb people.
[01:16:01.508 --> 01:16:05.351]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:53.730]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:56.912]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[01:16:57.672 --> 01:16:59.633]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[01:20:06.238 --> 01:20:08.901]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:42.421]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:44.122 --> 01:20:55.588]  When I say that we've gotten over 300 TV affiliates and over 70 cable affiliates, we already had 20 cable systems or so and maybe 15 TV stations.
[01:20:55.748 --> 01:21:00.391]  We got a particular type of satellite that was the newest and the fanciest, but it's not what people wanted.
[01:21:01.784 --> 01:21:07.527]  And I never really promoted it because I was always trying to build the new studios and go 20, 24 hours a day before I promoted it.
[01:21:07.907 --> 01:21:09.267]  But then a year turned into two years.
[01:21:09.848 --> 01:21:19.072]  So we went to a lot of these big conventions in Chicago, in Vegas, in New York, in Los Angeles, and we got the satellites everybody wanted.
[01:21:20.152 --> 01:21:22.173]  And we also said the key word, free to air.
[01:21:25.354 --> 01:21:28.496]  We're on an hour each hour, got 15 minutes of ads.
[01:21:29.878 --> 01:21:32.620]  Those 15 minutes ads are 100% belong to local stations.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:34.100]  They like that.
[01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:36.082]  We do a couple minutes of plugging each hour.
[01:21:38.283 --> 01:21:38.823]  For ourselves.
[01:21:39.163 --> 01:21:39.604]  And they love it.
[01:21:40.644 --> 01:21:41.725]  I want to do it with radio.
[01:21:42.085 --> 01:21:43.506]  Where our local affiliates get them all.
[01:21:43.546 --> 01:21:45.507]  But I'm still partnered with GCN.
[01:21:45.547 --> 01:21:46.468]  I can leave GCN.
[01:21:46.928 --> 01:21:47.988]  But I'm a very loyal person.
[01:21:48.008 --> 01:21:48.749]  I like Ted Anderson.
[01:21:49.389 --> 01:21:51.550]  And 90% of GCN's revenue is me.
[01:21:51.731 --> 01:21:53.171]  I'll tell you that.
[01:21:53.251 --> 01:21:53.752]  It's actually 97%.
[01:21:53.832 --> 01:21:55.573]  I think they're allowing me a little too much.
[01:21:57.741 --> 01:21:59.923]  But I'd like to go free-to-air on radio.
[01:21:59.963 --> 01:22:08.449]  That'd be so revolutionary for a for-profit show to give the local stations all the ads because my mission is to get the message out.
[01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:12.552]  That said, I got a big job ahead of me.
[01:22:12.612 --> 01:22:19.458]  I said every week I'm gonna profile a cable system that we're on and a radio network, a radio station.
[01:22:20.198 --> 01:22:26.163]  Here's the one I shot a few days ago on Friday and they produced it and I got to cut a new one this week for
[01:22:28.649 --> 01:22:34.992]  cable system that covers seven counties in Florida, and I've got ones in California.
[01:22:35.012 --> 01:22:38.174]  I don't want to say some of the ones are so big, but they want to be promoted.
[01:22:38.634 --> 01:22:43.577]  I know they'll get a few phone calls, a few harassments by the establishment, but they understand what they're signing on to.
[01:22:43.597 --> 01:22:44.578]  They understand we're under attack.
[01:22:44.938 --> 01:22:46.018]  They understand we're telling the truth.
[01:22:46.599 --> 01:22:47.179]  They're listeners.
[01:22:47.419 --> 01:22:52.302]  There's so many station owners and station managers and cable station owners picking us up now.
[01:22:53.621 --> 01:22:54.201]  It's exciting.
[01:22:54.962 --> 01:22:59.104]  We're in talks today with a gentleman that owns 200 TV stations.
[01:22:59.424 --> 01:23:00.885]  And it looks like they're going to pick us up.
[01:23:02.926 --> 01:23:04.587]  And we're talking 24 hours a day.
[01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:07.849]  Even though we're 10 hours live, it loops, because they've got these sub-channels.
[01:23:08.109 --> 01:23:08.909]  But those are popular.
[01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:10.990]  And then we run promos on their main channels.
[01:23:14.252 --> 01:23:21.136]  Now, I caught a one-minute promo they run on their channel on Channel 9 in Houston that reaches over 3 million homes.
[01:23:22.645 --> 01:23:22.905]  I think?
[01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:53.039]  And they've had us on for a few years, so I thought they'd be the one, they've got Ron Paul on every day as well, they'd be the one for us to promo first.
[01:23:53.079 --> 01:24:02.652]  But this is a job, I'm not complaining, because you're going to start seeing every week a new promo for TV and radio stations and radio networks that we're on.
[01:24:03.673 --> 01:24:14.455]  And so here it is in Houston, Phonoscope, and this is a promo running on Phonoscope that runs on CNN and all the channels on Basic Cable.
[01:24:14.795 --> 01:24:17.536]  Because that's how the cable rules work.
[01:24:17.576 --> 01:24:26.358]  So this ad and another one-minute ad and another 24-second ad are airing all over the cable in Houston, and the listenership is just exploding.
[01:24:26.378 --> 01:24:28.298]  I want to report that to George Soros.
[01:24:30.825 --> 01:24:33.127]  Every time we go under attack, God just opens another door.
[01:24:33.167 --> 01:24:34.348]  So thanks for your prayers, folks.
[01:24:34.388 --> 01:24:35.129]  Thanks for your support.
[01:24:35.369 --> 01:24:36.329]  We're reaching a lot more people.
[01:24:36.570 --> 01:24:37.831]  So here's that Phonoscope promo.
[01:24:38.611 --> 01:24:45.617]  Every week, we're going to be profiling a different TV station, TV network, or cable station or network that's picking up InfoWars.
[01:24:46.017 --> 01:24:52.422]  We're on well over 100 stations right now since we started our syndication push about six months ago.
[01:24:53.063 --> 01:24:58.848]  Now, one TV station that's actually been picking us up for several years that I want to profile first is Phonoscope.
[01:24:59.935 --> 01:25:09.180]  Phonoscope's creator and owner is the man that invented, more than 50, 60 years ago, streaming television over phone lines.
[01:25:09.441 --> 01:25:11.642]  That's why it's called Phonoscope, and why it's patented.
[01:25:12.122 --> 01:25:16.385]  Well, he's got several channels and stations in Houston, and he's got us on 24 hours a day.
[01:25:18.946 --> 01:25:23.390]  On PhonoScope, Channel 9 in Houston cable systems.
[01:25:23.951 --> 01:25:28.235]  So, we're talking a potential of 6 million people that are able to tune in.
[01:25:28.755 --> 01:25:29.996]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:25:30.096 --> 01:25:33.699]  So, to all of our listeners online, even if you're not in Houston,
[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:43.586]  Be sure and tell any friends, family, or neighbors, or folks that you know who live in the Houston area, they can tune in to cable channel 9 to Phonoscope.
[01:25:43.946 --> 01:25:55.854]  Not just for my four-hour broadcast every day from our state-of-the-art TV and radio studios here in Austin, but to Owen Schroer, David Knight, and all the other shows, and all the other news, and anchors, and analysis that we're adding.
[01:25:56.294 --> 01:25:58.976]  So, Phonoscope is our oldest TV affiliate.
[01:25:59.656 --> 01:26:03.457]  They've been picking us up, I guess, for four years now, and so we really appreciate them.
[01:26:03.477 --> 01:26:05.517]  They're also one of our biggest, massive response.
[01:26:05.977 --> 01:26:21.761]  So to Lee Cook and the entire family down there at Phonoscope, we salute you, and we also want to just ask all the viewers of my show and listeners of my show to tune into Phonoscope and also visit their website so you can find out about some of the other programs they put out, like Ron Paul's TV show.
[01:26:22.321 --> 01:26:22.681]  So again,
[01:26:23.181 --> 01:26:28.146]  For myself and the entire InfoWars crew in Austin, Texas, we salute Phonoscope in Houston.
[01:26:28.686 --> 01:26:30.188]  Thanks for all you're doing for this republic.
[01:26:30.468 --> 01:26:32.069]  You've helped make America great again.
[01:26:33.491 --> 01:26:37.474]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:26:37.695 --> 01:26:41.658]  I don't know why I shouldn't have promo over 100 TV stations.
[01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:46.483]  It's over 300, over 70 cable systems, and that was as of about a week ago.
[01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:51.453]  We just had a couple smaller deals, another 15 stations or so.
[01:26:51.473 --> 01:26:53.715]  A few more radio stations came in.
[01:26:55.336 --> 01:26:58.539]  But I think we're gonna get a deal with 200.
[01:26:58.739 --> 01:26:58.999]  200 more.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:02.622]  And a lot of these are in big cities and are the main channels.
[01:27:03.483 --> 01:27:10.129]  Where they're doing stuff like carrying my show, but taped to air at night during the family hour.
[01:27:10.930 --> 01:27:14.473]  And then they tell people, and tune over to our sub-channel for 24 hours a day.
[01:27:14.773 --> 01:27:15.554]  It's very smart.
[01:27:18.035 --> 01:27:21.680]  Now again, in the late 70s they said that AM stations were going to turn off.
[01:27:23.983 --> 01:27:34.257]  But then conservatives and libertarians and people like the great patriot who helped us get rid of the Fairness Doctrine had the ideas.
[01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:41.395]  To, hey, launch political talk radio on there and get around the leftist control that dominated television.
[01:27:41.775 --> 01:27:47.159]  So the internet of the 80s and 90s, before we really had the modern internet, was AM radio.
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.463]  And it's still there today, it's still doing pretty good, despite all the attacks.
[01:27:52.668 --> 01:27:54.590]  Because people decided to use it.
[01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:59.754]  Well, they say TV, local cable, local broadcast TV doesn't have the listeners it used to have with the viewers.
[01:27:59.934 --> 01:28:00.494]  It's not true.
[01:28:00.995 --> 01:28:04.657]  You put specialty things on, local sports, local news, it has huge ratings.
[01:28:04.918 --> 01:28:09.121]  You put special political programming on, that's pro-America, that people are hungry for.
[01:28:09.401 --> 01:28:12.543]  Why do you think Sinclair has had all this pro-Trump stuff on?
[01:28:12.744 --> 01:28:13.624]  Because it's popular.
[01:28:14.085 --> 01:28:15.366]  It sells, and it's good.
[01:28:17.467 --> 01:28:20.009]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, Sinclair knows what they're doing.
[01:28:20.029 --> 01:28:20.650]  They're the leader.
[01:28:22.005 --> 01:28:24.629]  Nationwide, in local television.
[01:28:25.751 --> 01:28:28.236]  And we're not on Sinclair, at this point.
[01:28:30.118 --> 01:28:31.579]  I'm saying they know what to do.
[01:28:31.999 --> 01:28:35.982]  So, these TV stations, these cable systems are putting us on all over.
[01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:37.122]  It is explosive.
[01:28:37.723 --> 01:28:39.184]  This is very, very exciting.
[01:28:39.244 --> 01:28:45.107]  So, thank you all for spreading the word to your local TV stations as well and your local cable.
[01:28:45.127 --> 01:28:45.988]  Tell them to pick us up.
[01:28:46.328 --> 01:28:48.609]  They can find all the details at InfoWars.com.
[01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:54.433]  Okay, we'll be back with a author, researcher, geopolitical expert, William Engdahl.

[01:30:40.918 --> 01:30:47.041]  Testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.

[01:31:37.044 --> 01:31:40.848]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[01:31:41.028 --> 01:31:46.074]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:52.160]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[01:31:53.081 --> 01:32:01.285]  Still that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[01:32:01.966 --> 01:32:04.827]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[01:32:05.507 --> 01:32:09.129]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, five days a week.
[01:32:09.229 --> 01:32:16.073]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[01:32:16.213 --> 01:32:16.513]  I'm just
[01:32:16.713 --> 01:32:20.856]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[01:32:21.277 --> 01:32:24.520]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:29.524]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[01:32:30.024 --> 01:32:35.609]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[01:32:35.669 --> 01:32:40.192]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[01:32:41.052 --> 01:32:42.352]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[01:32:42.552 --> 01:32:47.913]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[01:32:47.933 --> 01:32:49.234]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[01:32:49.274 --> 01:32:49.414]  Yeah.
[01:32:49.554 --> 01:32:51.434]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[01:32:51.474 --> 01:32:52.294]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[01:32:52.334 --> 01:32:54.015]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[01:32:54.055 --> 01:32:55.035]  We really appreciate you.
[01:32:55.395 --> 01:32:56.075]  Keep up the fight.
[01:32:56.115 --> 01:32:57.516]  We need to take California back.
[01:32:57.536 --> 01:32:57.916]  Thank you, Desiree.
[01:32:57.936 --> 01:32:59.016]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[01:32:59.056 --> 01:32:59.696]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[01:33:06.237 --> 01:33:08.838]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.901 --> 01:33:45.930]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:46.571 --> 01:33:48.812]  We're giving the globalists a run for their money.
[01:33:50.706 --> 01:33:57.189]  Trying to reboot the American Republic, trying to take power back from the IMF, the World Bank, the TPP, and transfer it back to our Republic.
[01:33:57.229 --> 01:34:02.851]  The globalists are really angry at Trump, but he's been doing some sideways stuff in Syria and other areas.
[01:34:03.351 --> 01:34:07.633]  F. William Ingalls, an award-winning geopolitical analyst, strategic risk consultant, and more.
[01:34:08.233 --> 01:34:10.955]  A century of war, Anglo-American oil politics, and more.
[01:34:11.035 --> 01:34:11.675]  Gods of money.
[01:34:12.035 --> 01:34:14.016]  We'll be talking to him here in just a moment.
[01:34:14.376 --> 01:34:15.877]  Newest book is Manifest Destiny.
[01:34:15.897 --> 01:34:16.337]  But first,
[01:34:17.608 --> 01:34:21.272]  This broadcast is brought to you by viewers like you.
[01:34:21.292 --> 01:34:26.418]  It's like the old PBS line, but we don't get money from David Rockefeller or those groups or George Soros.
[01:34:26.959 --> 01:34:28.241]  And how do we finance ourselves?
[01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:44.620]  Well, my dad's a now quasi-retired dentist, and he worked with the biggest manufacturer of organic fluoride-free toothpaste in the country to bring you Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste, fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:48.962]  It is amazing, it's concentrated, it's a great deal at its regular price.
[01:34:49.082 --> 01:34:55.607]  It is 50% off, and the mouthwash is 50% off, and the immune gargle in three sizes is 50% off, the Children's is 50% off.
[01:34:58.661 --> 01:35:06.305]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:08.066 --> 01:35:18.431]  Again, that is our new big special, and even though it's set to sell out in the next few weeks, and more doesn't come in until mid-June, I wanted to discount it massively because a lot of you are on the fence.
[01:35:19.861 --> 01:35:20.381]  We're good to go.
[01:35:42.512 --> 01:35:45.013]  Liver and kidney cleanse.
[01:35:45.053 --> 01:35:45.993]  That was sold out for months.
[01:35:46.033 --> 01:35:46.693]  It's back in stock.
[01:35:46.773 --> 01:35:48.314]  It's 40% off.
[01:35:48.354 --> 01:35:52.255]  So check out Icaron at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:52.355 --> 01:36:02.158]  And it is your purchases that make all of this possible and this big push we're doing against the globalists.
[01:36:02.218 --> 01:36:05.239]  Now, joining us is F. William Engdahl.
[01:36:06.325 --> 01:36:07.265]  Good to be with you again, Alex.
[01:36:31.069 --> 01:36:32.130]  It's been a long time.
[01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:39.133]  Geopolitically, before we get into the details, the 35,000-foot view, where is the world right now?
[01:36:39.673 --> 01:36:40.674]  How do you see Trump?
[01:36:40.734 --> 01:36:43.695]  How do you see Putin in this bipolar world?
[01:36:44.515 --> 01:36:46.076]  Or do you see it as a bipolar world?
[01:36:46.136 --> 01:36:51.939]  What is the state of the planet right now if we look back, say, 50 years from now to the history books?
[01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:56.181]  Right now, in my view, we're at a
[01:36:58.665 --> 01:37:24.674]  Uh, no friend of Al Gore, but we're at a critical tipping point geopolitically that, depending on what happens, I would say in the next 12 months will either determine if we have a chance at defanging this this globalist monster that you mentioned and creating more freedom in the world for building up.
[01:37:24.794 --> 01:37:26.795]  And what we have is a
[01:37:27.699 --> 01:37:28.980]  It's not really a deep state.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.562]  It's the powers that be behind the deep state.
[01:37:32.263 --> 01:37:40.008]  When he was alive, David Rockefeller was said to be the chairman of the board of this powers that be.
[01:37:40.469 --> 01:37:48.475]  But the families that don't appear in the public, the deep state are simply their house servants, their bureaucrats and so forth.
[01:37:49.656 --> 01:37:52.258]  Nasty as they are and vicious as they are.
[01:37:53.237 --> 01:38:15.974]  But right now you have a counter-poll, and you've had it building since all of the provocations, I would say going back to September 2001, with the war on terror, the occupation of Afghanistan, the occupation of Iraq, and so forth, supposedly going after Osama bin Laden, which was a faint, as you know,
[01:38:20.009 --> 01:38:37.595]  is the emergence of an attempted counter-pull or counterweight to this sole superpower that Papa Bush declared in 1990, after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[01:38:38.175 --> 01:38:48.619]  And the counterpart, or the counter-power, is the growing alliance between Russia, China, and interestingly enough, Iran.
[01:38:50.137 --> 01:39:10.509]  So if you go to the Defense Policy Strategy document that was just released about six weeks ago in Washington, they define the greatest potential threat facing the United States military in the world today is Russia and China.
[01:39:11.549 --> 01:39:17.253]  Now, General Votel, the head of CENTCOM, recently added Iran to that calculus.
[01:39:17.813 --> 01:39:19.334]  And you see, if you look at a map,
[01:39:20.097 --> 01:39:35.385]  And look at the trade agreements, look at the energy deals that are going on between these, the agreements to trade oil, not in dollars, but in their own currencies, building pipelines, exchanging
[01:39:36.258 --> 01:39:55.885]  Formidable Russian anti-aircraft defense systems and so forth, you begin to see that the Shanghai Cooperation Organization countries and the potential of Iran to become a member of that under the maintaining of this nuclear agreement that Trump seems to be about to cancel from the U.S.
[01:39:55.905 --> 01:39:58.346]  side, that that creates a counter-pull.
[01:39:59.526 --> 01:40:03.668]  And everything that we have seen coming out of Washington
[01:40:04.846 --> 01:40:11.932]  With Trump's acquiescence or without it, I think he's... Well, let me say something controversial.
[01:40:11.992 --> 01:40:13.994]  I think he's a secondary part of this.
[01:40:14.734 --> 01:40:22.820]  I don't think any president since Kennedy was assassinated in 1962 has set his own agenda.
[01:40:24.942 --> 01:40:29.726]  The deep state, the powers that be,
[01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:41.475]  Decide what the agenda is, and if a president tries to buck that, as many presidents have tried on the edges, if it's serious enough, they're dealt with.
[01:40:42.636 --> 01:40:58.064]  So I think that's what we're seeing recently with Trump, but the appointments John Bolton, National Security Advisor, Nikki Haley at the United Nations, Pompeo as Secretary of State, the
[01:41:00.501 --> 01:41:04.002]  Torture lady as head of CIA, potentially.
[01:41:06.043 --> 01:41:11.504]  You see that the policy establishment is bringing the U.S.
[01:41:11.604 --> 01:41:16.706]  into the next phase, which I think will be to knock Iran out.
[01:41:16.786 --> 01:41:17.686]  How are they going to do that?
[01:41:18.226 --> 01:41:20.207]  I don't think it's going to be through a war.
[01:41:22.228 --> 01:41:26.689]  This dog and pony show that Benjamin Netanyahu presented to the world about
[01:41:27.607 --> 01:41:39.657]  10 or 12 days ago with all these graphs and these colourful cartoons and very melodramatic presentation, there wasn't a shred of verifiable evidence presented in there, just some photos of what
[01:41:42.108 --> 01:41:47.310]  Well, it was just old, old admitted stuff that wasn't denied before, but then projected into the future.
[01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:48.430]  And, you know, I agree with you.
[01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:49.791]  Let me ask this question.
[01:41:50.231 --> 01:41:52.932]  Why do you think the power structure has been so angry at Trump?
[01:41:52.972 --> 01:41:57.233]  Because he signaled he wanted to work with Russia, he signaled he didn't want the U.S.
[01:41:57.273 --> 01:42:03.315]  to be a hegemonic power, he signaled he didn't want us bankrolling it, that he didn't want to rule through subterfuge.
[01:42:03.355 --> 01:42:07.237]  I mean, just his rhetoric is what sent them into such hysteria because, you know, now
[01:42:07.917 --> 01:42:13.779]  Now he is signaling with these new appointments that he's now getting back in line with the Anglo-American Imperium.
[01:42:15.379 --> 01:42:19.460]  Well, we may never know the exact answer to that Alex.
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:31.443]  It can be that a part of the circle around him generally is trying to de-escalate this lunatic attack on Russia with the
[01:42:33.283 --> 01:42:39.364]  That's important.
[01:42:39.404 --> 01:42:39.864]  Stay there.
[01:42:39.884 --> 01:42:43.045]  F. William Ingdahl, best-selling author, researcher, geopolitical expert.
[01:42:43.265 --> 01:42:43.985]  Really is a smart guy.
[01:42:44.025 --> 01:42:45.405]  I've been talking to him for 15 years.
[01:42:45.425 --> 01:42:46.986]  One of the leading experts out there.
[01:42:47.346 --> 01:42:52.006]  When we come back, we're going to get into that because Mattis, it seems, is somebody saying no to the insanity.
[01:42:52.587 --> 01:42:54.047]  From his intel, is that accurate?
[01:42:55.087 --> 01:43:00.008]  And then what would you call these other forces that don't want, you know, to have a world empire?
[01:43:00.028 --> 01:43:01.108]  And stay with us.
[01:43:02.995 --> 01:43:06.958]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[01:43:07.018 --> 01:43:14.485]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[01:43:14.545 --> 01:43:20.370]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[01:43:23.793 --> 01:43:26.755]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[01:43:27.796 --> 01:43:28.537]  But he didn't give up.
[01:43:29.821 --> 01:43:30.281]  And he won.
[01:43:32.002 --> 01:43:33.423]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[01:43:34.183 --> 01:43:38.285]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[01:43:39.506 --> 01:43:42.747]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[01:43:43.848 --> 01:43:44.748]  And they all died.
[01:43:44.988 --> 01:43:46.349]  All 180 plus men.
[01:43:48.230 --> 01:43:51.711]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[01:43:53.312 --> 01:43:57.554]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[01:43:57.734 --> 01:43:59.375]  But I know this.
[01:44:01.906 --> 01:44:22.200]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[01:44:23.703 --> 01:44:27.384]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[01:44:28.304 --> 01:44:35.847]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[01:44:38.247 --> 01:44:47.690]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[01:44:50.154 --> 01:44:53.497]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[01:44:54.498 --> 01:44:56.619]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[01:44:57.020 --> 01:44:59.242]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[01:45:00.583 --> 01:45:00.763]  PQQ.
[01:45:00.803 --> 01:45:00.983]  Go Q10.
[01:45:03.234 --> 01:45:10.939]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[01:45:11.359 --> 01:45:23.968]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.760]  Think about that.
[01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.481]  It's $74 right now.
[01:45:28.421 --> 01:45:33.362]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[01:45:34.403 --> 01:45:35.683]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[01:45:35.743 --> 01:45:44.085]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[01:45:44.425 --> 01:45:46.126]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[01:45:47.166 --> 01:45:54.167]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I'm not gambled.
[01:45:54.747 --> 01:45:55.608]  I know you want value.
[01:45:55.648 --> 01:46:12.651]  So we've bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people said it did for them.
[01:46:13.091 --> 01:46:14.511]  It is dramatic and
[01:46:15.262 --> 01:46:23.025]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[01:46:23.745 --> 01:46:32.248]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[01:46:32.788 --> 01:46:39.730]  DNA Force Plus, telomere support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call AAA-253-3139.
[01:46:42.248 --> 01:46:47.853]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[01:46:48.073 --> 01:46:48.513]  That's fine.
[01:46:49.954 --> 01:46:51.015]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[01:46:51.435 --> 01:46:52.136]  I'm funded by you.
[01:46:52.356 --> 01:46:53.257]  So thank you all.
[01:46:53.917 --> 01:46:58.901]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[01:46:59.442 --> 01:47:02.144]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[01:47:06.187 --> 01:47:08.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.684 --> 01:47:20.827]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:21.547 --> 01:47:23.028]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.824 --> 01:47:29.164]  All right.
[01:47:29.424 --> 01:47:33.065]  He's one of the most respected geopolitical analysts out there in Europe and the United States.
[01:47:33.125 --> 01:47:34.026]  He's F. William Ingdahl.
[01:47:34.046 --> 01:47:35.566]  He's been all over international television.
[01:47:35.586 --> 01:47:37.347]  He's written a whole bunch of best-selling books.
[01:47:37.387 --> 01:47:38.288]  I've read several of them.
[01:47:39.428 --> 01:47:46.191]  And he's joining us to get into the power structure and why the globalists hate Russia so much.
[01:47:46.231 --> 01:47:48.032]  Because I've never been to Russia.
[01:47:48.888 --> 01:47:55.673]  But I know Russia has been under basically neoliberal, globalist, proto-globalist control.
[01:47:56.233 --> 01:48:01.617]  The whole Bolshevik Revolution was financed by the British Crown, by U.S.
[01:48:01.677 --> 01:48:02.557]  robber baron interest.
[01:48:03.538 --> 01:48:05.519]  Perhaps as a historian he can break that down for you.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:07.100]  And then they've lost control of it.
[01:48:07.941 --> 01:48:11.924]  And now they're becoming Christian, they're becoming free market, they've got more resources than we've got.
[01:48:12.484 --> 01:48:13.845]  We should be working with Russia.
[01:48:13.885 --> 01:48:14.886]  And under General Flynn,
[01:48:15.819 --> 01:48:17.020]  And more pragmatic views.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:25.445]  I know at the Pentagon, we look at the threat of radical Islam, we look at demographic issues, we look at the need for resources.
[01:48:26.586 --> 01:48:33.530]  The United States, Europe and Russia should be unified for global peace and economic prosperity, spatial exploration.
[01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:35.151]  They're no longer the evil Soviet Union.
[01:48:35.771 --> 01:48:44.718]  But we're dealing with the very same interests from my view that actually created the Soviet Union and then worked through it to create a fake polar world to consolidate control.
[01:48:44.779 --> 01:48:52.605]  Now it looks like a real two polar world is materializing, but you're really the expert on this and you tie it into the eugenics, all of it.
[01:48:53.085 --> 01:48:54.146]  Who's hijacked the West?
[01:48:54.166 --> 01:48:57.109]  Because we're not taking over Russia for the average American.
[01:48:57.389 --> 01:49:03.774]  So we should probably define who the Anglo-American establishment is and then why they hate Russia so much, sir.
[01:49:03.814 --> 01:49:04.435]  Please break it down.
[01:49:06.701 --> 01:49:14.104]  I would go, and I go into this in great detail in the Manifest Destiny, Democracies, Cognitive Disorder, the new book.
[01:49:15.304 --> 01:49:31.710]  The rape of Russia, as I call it in the book, took place in a coup d'état against, well the Soviet Union was rotten and was collapsing anyway, and Gorbachev was ready to raise the white flag of surrender, but the
[01:49:34.222 --> 01:49:52.052]  In 1991, the CIA, and this I document in great detail in the book, the CIA, guided by the networks of George Bush Sr., worked to bring Boris Yeltsin into power and his family, the mafia around Yeltsin.
[01:49:52.472 --> 01:50:00.417]  They created the oligarchs, Michel Khodorkovsky, Berezovsky, oh, you name them, Abramowitz,
[01:50:01.295 --> 01:50:16.324]  And these multi-billionaire oligarchs were created by the Anglo-American establishment under, let's make it very simple, the City of London and Wall Street banks.
[01:50:17.165 --> 01:50:28.512]  Without those banks, the billions and billions of dollars of the Russian oligarchs could never have been laundered out of Russia into the assets that they bought all around the world.
[01:50:29.466 --> 01:50:35.752]  So, Russian organized crime is really a spinoff of what was then CIA organized crime.
[01:50:35.772 --> 01:50:38.834]  They used banks in Switzerland tied to Riggs Bank.
[01:50:39.515 --> 01:50:50.665]  The brother of President Bush Senior, Jonathan Bush, was up to his eyeballs in this whole... And that goes back to the OSS in World War II and the Sicilian networks and all.
[01:50:50.685 --> 01:50:54.048]  This is all mainline history because the average person doesn't know that
[01:50:54.768 --> 01:51:10.258]  The globalists, the proto-globalists, the Anglo-Americans went and colonized Russia, put the Soviets in, made them live in slave conditions, fenced all their products and raw material out, used them to launch invasions of countries that Western nations wouldn't accept.
[01:51:10.278 --> 01:51:13.480]  I mean, this is truly full-spectrum diabolic behavior.
[01:51:14.352 --> 01:51:14.552]  Yeah.
[01:51:15.092 --> 01:51:23.614]  Well, what happened in 1999, after 10 years of no pensions were being paid to Russians, suddenly there was mass unemployment.
[01:51:23.634 --> 01:51:30.256]  Alcoholism was a reaction of many unemployed Russians to this hopeless situation, or seeming hopeless.
[01:51:30.956 --> 01:51:43.279]  And a faction, a nationalist faction, of the intelligence community in Russia, backed an unknown young man by the name of Vladimir Putin.
[01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:53.097]  And managed to get him in as Prime Minister, and then Putin and the Nationalists made an offer that Yeltsin couldn't refuse.
[01:51:53.717 --> 01:52:01.662]  We let you leave office with your billions, get the hell out of politics, and we'll leave you alone, but we're taking over.
[01:52:02.743 --> 01:52:07.706]  And that is why the neocons, the people around President Trump today,
[01:52:08.562 --> 01:52:12.043]  Loathe and despise Russia with every fiber of their being.
[01:52:12.083 --> 01:52:22.827]  That's why Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eastern Europe, despises Putin and so forth.
[01:52:22.847 --> 01:52:36.012]  Because he drew the line in the sand in 1999 and in 2000 when he became President for the first time in the elections and said, no, Russia will not be destroyed as a functioning nation.
[01:52:36.132 --> 01:52:37.553]  We will rebuild it somehow.
[01:52:38.513 --> 01:52:54.899]  So all of the sanctions that are targeting the people around Putin, all of the lies that are coming, the fake media out of the US, CNN, you name it, BBC, this is all intended to demonize Putin for trying to
[01:52:56.281 --> 01:53:00.265]  Not declare war on the West, but trying to preserve the nation of Russia.
[01:53:16.141 --> 01:53:20.965]  A lot of patriots in our government, the citizens helped get Trump elected in the hope of repeating that.
[01:53:21.025 --> 01:53:29.132]  So if there is Russian collusion, it's that in Europe and in Brazil and all over, people know that Russia's gotten out from under this global scourge.
[01:53:30.293 --> 01:53:35.778]  And so Russia has led the way from the bottom out of this towards nationalism.
[01:53:35.798 --> 01:53:43.244]  And I think that's why they're so upset at Russia, because they see it as kind of patient zero of the globalist domino system collapsing.
[01:53:44.121 --> 01:53:47.223]  Yeah, I think that's a good summary of it.
[01:53:49.645 --> 01:54:04.115]  They get into a white rage when they think of Russia intervening at the invitation of the Bashar al-Assad government in Syria in September 2015 to prevent ISIS, which has a large component.
[01:54:04.175 --> 01:54:10.660]  Thousands of Chechen terrorists are fighting in Syria to topple Bashar al-Assad.
[01:54:12.121 --> 01:54:13.082]  There's a long-term
[01:54:14.235 --> 01:54:32.984]  Deep state agenda for Syria, which we're seeing the neocons and the people around them implement right now, and that is not to leave Syria, but to break up Syria into many warring principalities.
[01:54:34.128 --> 01:54:38.632]  Shia, Sunni, Alawite, Christian, and so forth.
[01:54:38.712 --> 01:54:39.012]  Kurds.
[01:54:39.452 --> 01:54:40.453]  And Kurds.
[01:54:40.934 --> 01:54:53.304]  And play one off against the other and then manipulate the whole pipeline strategy of that and also lead that into the destabilization of Iran.
[01:54:53.344 --> 01:54:54.565]  Not through war, I don't think.
[01:54:55.185 --> 01:55:03.592]  I think what's going to happen, as I suspect in a few minutes, President Trump will announce the not signing off on the nuclear agreement.
[01:55:04.523 --> 01:55:08.265]  Is that they'll put in snap sanctions.
[01:55:08.345 --> 01:55:20.911]  Mnuchin, the former Goldman Sachs guy who's running all these treasury wars around the world, talked about snap sanctions that will come right back in against Iran, prohibiting them from selling their oil.
[01:55:21.971 --> 01:55:28.934]  Look at what they did against Rusal, the second largest aluminum company in the world, with the sanctions a few weeks ago.
[01:55:29.655 --> 01:55:32.456]  And those sanctions are going to
[01:55:33.337 --> 01:55:40.781]  Create the background for a color revolution attempt again in Iran through popular discontent on the economy.
[01:55:40.841 --> 01:55:43.622]  And there are real problems in the Iranian economy, no question.
[01:55:44.323 --> 01:55:46.744]  So this is the agenda.
[01:55:47.244 --> 01:55:54.408]  Russia, Iran, China with the trade war, but that's only the beginning in China, and divide and rule.
[01:55:54.948 --> 01:55:56.129]  It's the globalist agenda.
[01:55:56.789 --> 01:55:59.591]  And I think the United States, you know,
[01:56:01.292 --> 01:56:02.652]  We should get out of these wars.
[01:56:02.692 --> 01:56:07.774]  We should rebuild America, make America great again, as Trump talked about in the election campaign.
[01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:10.135]  Well, that's the thing, is that it's paradoxical.
[01:56:10.195 --> 01:56:14.296]  Trump's done a lot of good things, the global shermanity, but now he's sliding into what they want.
[01:56:14.316 --> 01:56:16.196]  We're not saying Iran's run by good guys either.
[01:56:16.556 --> 01:56:20.818]  It's just part of this larger seven-nation takedown that Leslie Clark talked about.
[01:56:20.838 --> 01:56:25.419]  There's got to be a third way out of this, and I know Russia's tried to work with us
[01:56:25.819 --> 01:56:27.400]  They've tried to fight radical Islam.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:30.001]  They've really been putting up with their troops getting killed.
[01:56:30.302 --> 01:56:31.442]  They've really bent over backwards.
[01:56:31.462 --> 01:56:32.503]  And I'm not a Russophile.
[01:56:32.903 --> 01:56:33.663]  It's just a fact.
[01:56:34.564 --> 01:56:34.864]  Yeah.
[01:56:36.485 --> 01:56:37.526]  It can't be disputed.
[01:56:37.986 --> 01:56:39.567]  It's on record.
[01:56:39.667 --> 01:56:45.070]  And they've had conference after conference to try to get the United States involved in that.
[01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:48.992]  Every time there's been duplicity on the side of Washington.
[01:56:51.193 --> 01:56:54.015]  I think the situation with Trump as a person is that
[01:56:55.704 --> 01:57:05.804]  Somebody has the blackmail dossier on Donald Trump and every time he tries to do something halfway positive, he gets slammed.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:12.764]  I would concentrate less on the person of Donald Trump and more on the overall actions that are coming up.
[01:57:12.804 --> 01:57:13.084]  I agree.
[01:57:13.224 --> 01:57:13.544]  I agree.
[01:57:13.564 --> 01:57:14.365]  We've got to go to break.
[01:57:14.385 --> 01:57:18.167]  The President's about five minutes out, but stay with us for five more minutes before the President comes on.
[01:57:18.187 --> 01:57:19.287]  He's usually about five minutes late.
[01:57:19.708 --> 01:57:20.828]  President Trump gives remarks.
[01:57:20.928 --> 01:57:22.790]  Coming up next, we're going to be showing that.
[01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:25.731]  But, Ev William Ingdahl, do a few more minutes with us on your book.
[01:57:25.771 --> 01:57:26.812]  Come back for a full hour.
[01:57:27.132 --> 01:57:27.813]  I've read your new book.
[01:57:27.833 --> 01:57:31.495]  I've read two of your books, one on GMO and one on the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:57:31.815 --> 01:57:41.778]  Right, a few years ago, I forget the names, but I want to read the new one because what you say is so on target, just from the globalist-owned writings of what they admit, you just give your perspective, which I think is dead on.
[01:57:41.798 --> 01:57:48.720]  So I want to talk about how do we exactly focus on populism, nationalism versus globalism, and not pin everything on Trump.
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:49.920]  I think that'd be a mistake.
[01:57:49.961 --> 01:57:50.441]  We'll be back.
[01:57:52.881 --> 01:58:01.304]  I was talking to Sam in Texas, who came into the ATX, just experienced it wearing an Infowars shirt, and they were very hateful.
[01:58:02.734 --> 01:58:11.208]  Man, I was rocked into the Starbucks on South Lamar in my InfoWars t-shirt, and let me tell ya, I was the only InfoWarrior in the place.
[01:58:11.932 --> 01:58:17.736]  We make a point to be polite, to tip well, to say please and thank you, hold doors for people.
[01:58:17.976 --> 01:58:21.559]  But you guys experience a lot of hatred and I just appreciate you.
[01:58:21.579 --> 01:58:23.360]  I commend you for holding up under that.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:25.982]  It's an honor to do it because these are weak people.
[01:58:26.002 --> 01:58:27.083]  We have to stand strong in their face.
[01:58:27.103 --> 01:58:30.225]  But yeah, living here in Austin is quite interesting now.
[01:58:30.605 --> 01:58:38.271]  I got a really nice InfoWars May the Truth Be With You black t-shirt and I wear it a lot of places and I get commendations too.
[01:58:40.284 --> 01:58:41.765]  People commend me for wearing it.
[01:58:41.825 --> 01:58:52.649]  They kind of have a look in their eye that, man, it takes some conscience to stand up to the persecution and to tell people what we really believe and where we really stand.
[01:58:52.849 --> 01:58:54.889]  But it's nothing new in Christianity.
[01:58:55.450 --> 01:59:04.273]  So yes, I walked into Starbucks today and every person, every person takes a sidelong look at that shirt.
[01:59:05.633 --> 01:59:07.133]  They chat among themselves.
[01:59:07.173 --> 01:59:08.434]  Hey, that's one of those guys.
[01:59:08.594 --> 01:59:12.155]  That's one of those enemies That's that's one of the ones that we talk about.
[01:59:12.735 --> 01:59:13.215]  They're real.
[01:59:13.455 --> 01:59:13.835]  That's it.
[01:59:13.875 --> 01:59:16.275]  That's one right there It's bad.
[01:59:16.415 --> 01:59:31.719]  I also were proud of myself And it's so sad all we're trying to do is free market freedom Everything that we know works and they're just brainwashed by big corporations that think of them as morons like Jeff Bezos Bezos
[01:59:33.354 --> 01:59:37.716]  It's very frustrating, and I just wish that I could deprogram them, but, you know?
[01:59:37.996 --> 01:59:45.720]  And actually, I enjoy being at the grocery store and having somebody come over and scream and cuss at me only every once in a while, you know, and every 50th person that goes by.
[01:59:46.161 --> 01:59:50.203]  And I know that I'm upsetting them because I'm challenging their whole system.
[01:59:54.405 --> 02:00:00.288]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.969 --> 02:00:29.864]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:34.918 --> 02:00:39.159]  Alright, as I said, the President usually speaks six, seven, eight minutes late to make sure everybody tunes in.
[02:00:40.039 --> 02:00:43.720]  So, next segment we'll be carrying the President's unfortunate remarks on Iran.
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:44.700]  I'm not a fan of Iran.
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:46.120]  I don't like the Obama deal.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:46.940]  It was a scam.
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.741]  Bunch of payments back, but this definitely wheels us towards war.
[02:00:51.921 --> 02:00:55.602]  And, you know, we had Bibi telling us about the WMDs in Iraq that were a sure thing.
[02:00:57.082 --> 02:01:00.123]  I understand that Saudi Arabia, you know, is behind ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[02:01:00.723 --> 02:01:06.526]  But then New York City is suing Iran, saying they did 9-11.
[02:01:06.566 --> 02:01:07.447]  That's preposterous.
[02:01:07.487 --> 02:01:09.067]  So this is just reality here.
[02:01:09.187 --> 02:01:11.369]  F. William Engdahl, big picture here.
[02:01:11.749 --> 02:01:13.730]  Nationalism rising, globalism's in trouble.
[02:01:14.690 --> 02:01:15.951]  How would you describe this fight?
[02:01:16.031 --> 02:01:17.532]  What we should do to really expose it?
[02:01:17.612 --> 02:01:23.375]  And what you think the tricks are they have up their sleeves to try to keep this world corporate government going?
[02:01:24.631 --> 02:01:31.813]  Well, one of the major tricks they've developed since the Reagan era is the color revolutions that I talk about in the Manifest Destiny book.
[02:01:33.173 --> 02:01:46.757]  These things have become so refined, they have techniques called swarming, where they have hit-and-run street protests like they did recently in Yerevan and across Armenia to topple the government in that country.
[02:01:47.788 --> 02:01:56.374]  Then bring in someone who's more friendly to the United States, although he claims to be still wanting to keep the economic union with Russia.
[02:01:57.154 --> 02:02:05.399]  So this is one of the things that we are seeing and that has not been rolled rolled back at all since the Trump presidency began.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:13.765]  Despite his comments to that effect, I think we're going to see economic sanctions, financial sanctions, financial warfare.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:16.782]  Because these sanctions are a form of warfare.
[02:02:16.802 --> 02:02:21.046]  They're irregular warfare, but they're every bit as deadly.
[02:02:21.066 --> 02:02:21.787]  They're siege.
[02:02:21.847 --> 02:02:23.348]  They're forms of blockades.
[02:02:24.029 --> 02:02:24.730]  Yeah.
[02:02:25.591 --> 02:02:26.632]  Diabolical forms.
[02:02:26.832 --> 02:02:33.858]  Very precise targeting individual key industrialists in key countries or the oil sales of Iran.
[02:02:34.839 --> 02:02:38.062]  So it's about crippling your adversaries.
[02:02:38.142 --> 02:02:39.584]  It's the old Wolfowitz plan from
[02:02:40.581 --> 02:02:51.014]  1992, when Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense, no rival country or nation or group of countries will be allowed to challenge American hegemony.
[02:02:51.747 --> 02:03:01.751]  And that smacks to my mind of imperialism, something that America never... Well beyond that, and of course you're right, the globalists make us pay for it.
[02:03:01.791 --> 02:03:02.852]  They hate America too.
[02:03:02.892 --> 02:03:04.393]  They're targeting flyover country.
[02:03:04.713 --> 02:03:07.354]  Christians, they're trying to enslave us here as well.
[02:03:07.394 --> 02:03:08.955]  This is not America doing this.
[02:03:09.275 --> 02:03:13.777]  This is America basically hijacked like a slave to carry out this crime.
[02:03:14.877 --> 02:03:18.839]  That's why I always refer to Washington and not the United States because it's not
[02:03:19.637 --> 02:03:28.481]  Most Americans, most of my friends are, unless they read alternative media, have not a clue.
[02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:31.543]  They can't believe something different from the Washington Post.
[02:03:32.603 --> 02:03:45.330]  So, you know, if that's all you're exposed to when you're trying to work, hold down two jobs just to keep your family fed and the roof over your head, you don't have time to do a lot of this thinking.
[02:03:45.690 --> 02:03:47.791]  And so it's
[02:03:48.749 --> 02:03:51.710]  It's difficult, but we're the human guinea pigs.
[02:03:51.730 --> 02:03:59.052]  The American people are the human guinea pigs of this, I would call it, global fascist elite.
[02:03:59.232 --> 02:04:07.635]  I use that term very, very carefully and very economically precise, but they want top-down total control.
[02:04:07.695 --> 02:04:09.055]  They're totalitarians.
[02:04:09.595 --> 02:04:11.876]  They're not Democrats in any way, shape, or form.
[02:04:12.769 --> 02:04:17.053]  No matter how much they yell at Russia for being undemocratic, they're the least democratic.
[02:04:17.073 --> 02:04:17.433]  That's right.
[02:04:17.473 --> 02:04:24.059]  There's a world totalitarian corporate state playing countries off against each other, and it's really terrible.
[02:04:24.539 --> 02:04:26.541]  F. William Engdahl, williamengdahl.com.
[02:04:26.561 --> 02:04:29.724]  Please come back for a full hour soon to talk about your book, Manifest Desi.
[02:04:29.744 --> 02:04:32.366]  Maybe I should buy a bunch and sell them, and then fullwarrestore.com.
[02:04:32.406 --> 02:04:32.827]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:33.747 --> 02:04:34.048]  Thank you.
[02:04:34.707 --> 02:04:36.929]  That was a powerful interview, and it's spot on, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:36.949 --> 02:04:38.210]  Doesn't mean Iran's perfect.
[02:04:38.530 --> 02:04:39.571]  Doesn't mean I don't like the deal.
[02:04:39.671 --> 02:04:47.216]  It means Trump is being pushed into what he was against before, and again, our own government's pushing radical Islam against Russia.
[02:04:47.817 --> 02:04:50.479]  So, it's the same globalists that want Europe open to Islam.
[02:04:50.779 --> 02:04:55.663]  That is another big keystone to all this, is flooding us with Islamists, and Putin has said no to that.
[02:04:55.983 --> 02:04:57.644]  That's another reason George Soros hates it.
[02:04:57.664 --> 02:04:59.986]  Remember, George Soros is a major general in all this.
[02:05:00.546 --> 02:05:02.328]  We'll be back on the other side with the President.
[02:05:04.855 --> 02:05:10.518]  Former Secretary of State John Kerry has been having secret meetings with foreign officials to keep the U.S.
[02:05:10.618 --> 02:05:14.120]  in the Iran nuclear deal, and President Trump is not having it.
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:27.908]  Kerry was one of the key architects of the Iran deal, which was signed in 2015, and the Boston Globe reported last week that he'd been quietly meeting with Iranian and EU officials in recent months to strategize how to save his legacy.
[02:05:28.268 --> 02:05:35.836]  Trump tweeted, the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.
[02:05:36.096 --> 02:05:38.739]  He was the one that curated this mess in the first place.
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:46.768]  President Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal, calling it one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the US has ever entered into.
[02:05:47.088 --> 02:05:54.276]  Back in February of 2017, President Trump tweeted Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S.
[02:05:54.316 --> 02:05:58.220]  came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal.
[02:05:58.240 --> 02:05:59.822]  150 billion dollars.
[02:06:00.383 --> 02:06:02.225]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com
[02:06:29.167 --> 02:06:34.270]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:40.754 --> 02:06:41.534]  A new world order.
[02:06:44.536 --> 02:06:51.740]  Well, we are waiting, you can hear the room noise there, for the president to give his announcement on Iran, which we think will be pulling out of the deal.
[02:06:53.121 --> 02:06:57.684]  Probably setting a timetable for new talks, and that they don't come to the table, there'll be a
[02:07:00.768 --> 02:07:03.430]  Continuation of the sanctions that were previously there.
[02:07:04.151 --> 02:07:06.633]  Now the sanctions brought North Korea to the table in a good way.
[02:07:06.653 --> 02:07:08.094]  We got that big piece still coming up.
[02:07:08.655 --> 02:07:19.884]  Maybe Trump's right in what he's doing, but remember the globalists have been caught behind the scenes under several administrations propping up the mullahs who are very unpopular.
[02:07:19.904 --> 02:07:23.327]  So I'm certainly not fans of them, but it's a serious situation.
[02:07:23.928 --> 02:07:26.370]  In other news, up on newswars.com,
[02:07:28.504 --> 02:07:31.586]  And InfoWars.com, remember, it's an ongoing InfoWar.
[02:07:32.306 --> 02:07:48.236]  And when you email to your neighbors, your friends, your family, the stories every day, when you hand print them out and leave them at the dental office or the barber or at church, when you tell people about the show, that bypasses the AI, the sensors, everything they're doing.
[02:07:48.256 --> 02:07:51.818]  When you tell people about the local radio station you're listening to, it's so important.
[02:07:52.879 --> 02:07:55.861]  When you tell people about the local TV station you're watching or cable station,
[02:07:57.867 --> 02:08:03.210]  It's so critical, like Channel 9 in Houston that's the focus of our promotion this week.
[02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:09.533]  Every week I'm gonna promote another affiliate or another network we're on because we are getting hundreds and hundreds of new stations.
[02:08:09.553 --> 02:08:10.233]  It's very exciting.
[02:08:10.774 --> 02:08:15.616]  Jamie White writing a very powerful article on Infowars.com.
[02:08:17.337 --> 02:08:17.797]  Shocker!
[02:08:17.877 --> 02:08:24.601]  Soros funded the disgraced New York AG amid sex scandal allegations.
[02:08:30.345 --> 02:08:33.447]  So, Snyderman has a lot of big buddies.
[02:08:33.507 --> 02:08:35.728]  It's always Soros popping up, isn't it?
[02:08:36.308 --> 02:08:39.430]  This is the guy that's the big Me Too movement guy in New York.
[02:08:39.850 --> 02:08:50.535]  Trump, three years ago, or 2013, four years ago, hard to believe how time's flying, said, oh, disgraced wiener, disgraced New York governor for sex stuff.
[02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:52.976]  Oh, you're going to be disgraced next.
[02:08:53.016 --> 02:08:54.037]  This guy's even worse.
[02:08:54.817 --> 02:08:55.538]  And boy, is Trump
[02:08:56.499 --> 02:09:04.184]  Been proven right about Schneiderman reportedly calling minorities his brown slaves as he ravaged and raped them, sexually assaulted them.
[02:09:05.364 --> 02:09:13.449]  And he covered up years ago for all the women that came forward saying Harvey Weinstein raped them in New York, even though there were witnesses.
[02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:18.733]  And now Soros, it turns out, is funding him, of course.
[02:09:19.373 --> 02:09:25.497]  Disgraced former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned after being accused by four women of sexual misconduct,
[02:09:26.636 --> 02:09:32.004]  Was partly funded by none other than billionaire George Soros and the Soros family.
[02:09:34.087 --> 02:09:35.870]  And look, there he is with Alex Soros.
[02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:37.773]  Look how creepy these two look together.
[02:09:39.515 --> 02:09:41.638]  Alex Soros got caught this year.
[02:09:43.534 --> 02:09:57.698]  And from 2015 in documents, funding riots in green and in blue cities, working with the police to allow them to stage the riots with Antifa, hoping it would trigger a race war so Obama could declare a civil emergency.
[02:09:59.018 --> 02:10:00.659]  What a nice young man.
[02:10:01.599 --> 02:10:05.740]  The heir to the Soros fortune, Alex Soros.
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:11.742]  Oh, it's good to have a good attorney general so you can have all the fun you want at the spirit cooking events that Alex says he likes to attend.
[02:10:14.113 --> 02:10:16.594]  Got their little Alistair Crowley operation going on there.
[02:10:18.194 --> 02:10:26.936]  Schneiderman, previously known as Me Too Champion, a staunch anti-Trump Democrat, received hundreds of thousands of dollars from members of the Soros family for years.
[02:10:28.516 --> 02:10:31.657]  Well, it's good to have the law enforcement on the payroll.
[02:10:33.057 --> 02:10:35.097]  Soros and his sons donated $110,000 in just the last three years alone.
[02:10:38.217 --> 02:10:39.598]  They're buying everybody in your town, too.
[02:10:39.618 --> 02:10:54.531]  Other notable donors include Segerman whiskey magnate Edgar Brothman Sr., whose daughters Claire and Sarah Brothman bankrolled Albany-based sex cult NXIVM and ex-Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein's attorney David Bowles.
[02:10:55.272 --> 02:11:04.179]  It's worth noting that Schneiderman refused to investigate the Brothman sisters running NXIVM out of Albany until public pressure compelled him.
[02:11:04.900 --> 02:11:05.901]  Trump's not speaking yet, is he?
[02:11:08.923 --> 02:11:10.383]  Let me know as soon as he does, thank you.
[02:11:11.264 --> 02:11:25.168]  It's worth noting that Schneiderman refused to investigate the Brothman sisters running Nexium out of Albany until public pressure compelled him to do so just last March following the arrest of the founder Keith Raniere.
[02:11:25.408 --> 02:11:29.469]  Not even the Seagrams, not even the Brothmans had enough power to stop this guy.
[02:11:29.890 --> 02:11:31.190]  And actress Allison Mack
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:47.024]  Schneiderman resigned Monday after allegations surfaced that he sexually abused four women in New York in a piece co-written by journalist Rowan Farrow who first exposed Weinstein last October.
[02:11:50.165 --> 02:11:54.026]  And then it just goes on with what supposedly happened there.
[02:11:55.546 --> 02:11:59.728]  Well, it certainly fits in to the whole thing.
[02:11:59.768 --> 02:12:00.508]  And here's Trump.
[02:12:01.516 --> 02:12:04.337]  Trump on Eric in 2013.
[02:12:04.897 --> 02:12:05.218]  Tweet.
[02:12:06.918 --> 02:12:07.899]  Wait and see.
[02:12:09.439 --> 02:12:12.020]  Worse than Spencer and Weiner, he said of Schneiderman.
[02:12:13.961 --> 02:12:14.321]  Worse?
[02:12:15.442 --> 02:12:16.342]  Lolita Express?
[02:12:17.523 --> 02:12:18.083]  Please tell me.
[02:12:19.703 --> 02:12:20.344]  Him too!
[02:12:20.484 --> 02:12:25.406]  Anti-Trump New York City AG Eric Schneiderman resigns after sex abuse allegations.
[02:12:25.446 --> 02:12:28.027]  And don't forget another liberal so-called feminist.
[02:12:29.445 --> 02:12:30.606]  You can leave the background noise on.
[02:12:30.666 --> 02:12:31.206]  I think it's kind of cool.
[02:12:31.226 --> 02:12:33.287]  Let's hear the background from the White House briefing room.
[02:12:34.268 --> 02:12:35.348]  This didn't age well.
[02:12:35.368 --> 02:12:42.893]  Samantha Bee described Schneiderman as a superhero who would stop Trump, the so-called sexual abuser.
[02:12:44.134 --> 02:12:46.475]  What did Governor Cuomo know about his attorney general?
[02:12:47.115 --> 02:12:48.276]  Asked the Daily Caller.
[02:12:49.277 --> 02:12:49.777]  Quite a bit.
[02:12:54.221 --> 02:12:59.465]  So, we're about to find out what's happening on the whole Iran deal with the President here in just a moment.
[02:13:01.307 --> 02:13:04.569]  Before we go any further, we hear the clapping.
[02:13:04.589 --> 02:13:06.631]  That means the President is coming to the podium here.
[02:13:07.832 --> 02:13:08.272]  Here he is.
[02:13:08.332 --> 02:13:08.633]  Here we go.
[02:13:08.653 --> 02:13:10.314]  Let's see what's about to happen on Iran.
[02:13:12.716 --> 02:13:22.584]  My fellow Americans, today I want to update the world on our efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
[02:13:23.851 --> 02:13:28.333]  The Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terror.
[02:13:29.373 --> 02:13:44.459]  It exports dangerous missiles, fuels conflicts across the Middle East, and supports terrorist proxies and militias such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Taliban, and Al-Qaeda.
[02:13:45.579 --> 02:14:02.209]  Over the years, Iran and its proxies have bombed American embassies and military installations, murdered hundreds of American service members, and kidnapped, imprisoned, and tortured American citizens.
[02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:11.535]  The Iranian regime has funded its long reign of chaos and terror by plundering the wealth of its own people.
[02:14:12.755 --> 02:14:22.764]  No action taken by the regime has been more dangerous than its pursuit of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them.
[02:14:24.385 --> 02:14:32.392]  In 2015, the previous administration joined with other nations in a deal regarding Iran's nuclear program.
[02:14:33.233 --> 02:14:38.678]  This agreement was known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.
[02:14:40.163 --> 02:14:56.168]  In theory, the so-called Iran deal was supposed to protect the United States and our allies from the lunacy of an Iranian nuclear bomb, a weapon that will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.
[02:14:57.608 --> 02:14:59.929]  In fact, the deal allowed Iran
[02:15:00.770 --> 02:15:02.834]  Let's stop right there.
[02:15:03.375 --> 02:15:04.036]  We can hit pause.
[02:15:04.076 --> 02:15:04.697]  He's live now.
[02:15:04.717 --> 02:15:07.743]  He won't be live when we come back, but it'll be continued on from the same spot.
[02:15:07.763 --> 02:15:10.148]  We'll carry the meat of it when we return from break.
[02:15:10.669 --> 02:15:11.711]  Again, briefly as I was saying.
[02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:21.795]  Our overall best-selling product, it's not our profitable product, because it's, even with, you know, markup, we only make six, seven dollars on it when it's at full price.
[02:15:21.835 --> 02:15:22.736]  It's always discounted 25%.
[02:15:22.796 --> 02:15:25.598]  Well, it's 50% off right now.
[02:15:25.618 --> 02:15:28.219]  I mean, we make about three and a half dollars on it.
[02:15:28.239 --> 02:15:29.700]  There's three dollars of product in it.
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:32.022]  There's no other toothpaste out there that's three dollars a product.
[02:15:32.322 --> 02:15:34.684]  This is produced by the number one organic producer in the country.
[02:15:34.704 --> 02:15:41.749]  According to our specifications, it's concentrated, there's no fillers, it's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine, and it has no fluoride in it.
[02:15:42.429 --> 02:15:44.370]  For the adult and the children, it's 50% off.
[02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:48.191]  And the three immune gargles are 50% off, along with the mouthwash.
[02:15:48.472 --> 02:15:50.312]  They're also fortified with colloidal silver and iodine.
[02:15:51.273 --> 02:15:57.375]  All Super Blue products are 50% off and free shipping when you get the big combo deal on top of it.
[02:15:57.796 --> 02:15:59.856]  Sign up for auto ship with an additional 10% off.
[02:16:00.096 --> 02:16:01.117]  That makes it a loss leader.
[02:16:04.691 --> 02:16:23.001]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:16:23.101 --> 02:16:29.004]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:16:29.384 --> 02:16:30.064]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:16:30.504 --> 02:16:33.326]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:16:33.986 --> 02:16:34.967]  And so much more.
[02:16:35.527 --> 02:16:36.648]  It is concentrated.
[02:16:36.868 --> 02:16:38.589]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:16:38.609 --> 02:16:44.292]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:16:44.412 --> 02:16:45.613]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:16:45.633 --> 02:16:47.554]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:16:47.634 --> 02:16:50.016]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:16:50.236 --> 02:16:51.497]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:16:51.677 --> 02:16:53.478]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:16:54.038 --> 02:16:54.639]  Immune Wall.

[02:17:02.739 --> 02:17:05.920]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:17:06.381 --> 02:17:07.701]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:17:08.182 --> 02:17:19.607]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:17:20.407 --> 02:17:29.312]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:17:29.733 --> 02:17:40.419]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:17:40.939 --> 02:17:43.261]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[02:17:43.601 --> 02:17:44.962]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:17:45.343 --> 02:17:54.951]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:17:55.071 --> 02:17:57.212]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.

[02:19:05.848 --> 02:19:07.249]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:19:07.309 --> 02:19:08.751]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:19:08.831 --> 02:19:09.171]  Go ahead.
[02:19:09.271 --> 02:19:09.571]  Yes.
[02:19:09.992 --> 02:19:10.732]  Hi, Alex.
[02:19:10.832 --> 02:19:17.018]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:19:17.238 --> 02:19:21.222]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:19:21.462 --> 02:19:22.903]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:19:23.283 --> 02:19:29.969]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:19:30.049 --> 02:19:32.812]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:19:33.793 --> 02:19:38.496]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:19:38.516 --> 02:19:46.342]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:19:46.382 --> 02:19:52.186]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:19:52.326 --> 02:19:57.650]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:19:57.730 --> 02:20:00.732]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:20:06.679 --> 02:20:09.293]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.438 --> 02:20:24.079]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[02:20:24.299 --> 02:20:28.982]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.722 --> 02:20:31.443]  That's right.
[02:20:31.603 --> 02:20:35.606]  Let's go back to the president where we paused it during his speech.
[02:20:35.626 --> 02:20:37.607]  We were taking it down live off our satellite feed.
[02:20:38.087 --> 02:20:39.608]  Now I've punched it up on Fox News.
[02:20:40.148 --> 02:20:44.851]  Let's go ahead and roll him getting into what he plans to do, pulling out of the Iran deal.
[02:20:45.657 --> 02:20:50.803]  That will only endanger the survival of the Iranian regime.
[02:20:52.265 --> 02:21:02.797]  In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.
[02:21:03.991 --> 02:21:22.657]  The deal lifted crippling economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for very weak limits on the regime's nuclear activity, and no limits at all on its other malign behavior, including its sinister activities in Syria,
[02:21:23.562 --> 02:21:25.004]  We're good to go.
[02:21:39.102 --> 02:21:41.766]  And it's a regime of great terror.
[02:21:42.547 --> 02:21:47.094]  Many billions of dollars, some of it in actual cash.
[02:21:47.975 --> 02:21:53.843]  A great embarrassment to me as a citizen and to all citizens of the United States.
[02:21:55.251 --> 02:22:01.354]  A constructive deal could easily have been struck at the time, but it wasn't.
[02:22:02.114 --> 02:22:11.818]  At the heart of the Iran deal was a giant fiction that a murderous regime desired only a peaceful nuclear energy program.
[02:22:12.822 --> 02:22:18.444]  Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.
[02:22:19.505 --> 02:22:33.390]  Last week, Israel published intelligence documents, long concealed by Iran, conclusively showing the Iranian's regime and its history of pursuing nuclear weapons.
[02:22:34.071 --> 02:22:39.853]  The fact is, this was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.
[02:22:41.016 --> 02:22:42.020]  It didn't bring calm.
[02:22:42.804 --> 02:22:43.667]  It didn't bring peace.
[02:22:44.750 --> 02:22:45.691]  And it never will.
[02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:56.519]  In the years since the deal was reached, Iran's military budget has grown by almost 40%, while its economy is doing very badly.
[02:22:57.580 --> 02:23:10.309]  After the sanctions were lifted, the dictatorship used its new funds to build nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism, and cause havoc throughout the Middle East and beyond.
[02:23:10.329 --> 02:23:10.909]  Well, that is the big one.
[02:23:10.949 --> 02:23:12.631]  They are delivering long-range ICBMs.
[02:23:13.131 --> 02:23:13.751]  That's true.
[02:23:13.852 --> 02:23:16.313]  That's true, they've got all the components, John.
[02:23:41.671 --> 02:23:45.915]  That's a good point, because Saudi Arabia wants to know.
[02:23:46.436 --> 02:24:05.573]  The deal's inspection provisions lack adequate mechanisms to prevent, detect, and punish cheating, and don't even have the unqualified right to inspect many important locations, including military facilities.
[02:24:06.554 --> 02:24:20.740]  Not only does the deal fail to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, but it also fails to address the regime's development of ballistic missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads.
[02:24:21.661 --> 02:24:30.605]  Finally, the deal does nothing to constrain Iran's destabilizing activities, including its support for terrorism.
[02:24:31.864 --> 02:24:38.831]  Since the agreement, Iran's bloody ambitions have grown only more brazen.
[02:24:39.652 --> 02:24:49.040]  In light of these glaring flaws, I announced last October that the Iran deal must either be renegotiated or terminated.
[02:24:49.861 --> 02:24:55.465]  Three months later, on January 12th, I repeated these conditions.
[02:24:56.206 --> 02:25:04.192]  I made clear that if the deal could not be fixed, the United States would no longer be a party to the agreement.
[02:25:05.232 --> 02:25:15.498]  Over the past few months, we have engaged extensively with our allies and partners around the world, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
[02:25:16.219 --> 02:25:20.642]  We have also consulted with our friends from across the Middle East.
[02:25:21.582 --> 02:25:31.904]  We are unified in our understanding of the threat and in our conviction that Iran must never acquire a nuclear weapon.
[02:25:33.045 --> 02:25:47.008]  After these consultations, it is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement.
[02:25:48.038 --> 02:25:51.641]  The Iran deal is defective at its core.
[02:25:52.442 --> 02:25:57.547]  If we do nothing, we know exactly what will happen.
[02:25:58.428 --> 02:26:08.517]  In just a short period of time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons.
[02:26:09.678 --> 02:26:18.704]  Therefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
[02:26:19.845 --> 02:26:25.908]  In a few moments, I will sign a presidential memorandum to begin reinstating U.S.
[02:26:25.988 --> 02:26:29.651]  nuclear sanctions on the Iranian regime.
[02:26:30.822 --> 02:26:36.506]  We will be instituting the highest level of economic sanction.
[02:26:37.526 --> 02:26:45.171]  Any nation that helps Iran in its quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States.
[02:26:45.771 --> 02:26:49.594]  America will not be held hostage to nuclear blackmail.
[02:26:50.552 --> 02:26:55.898]  We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
[02:26:56.759 --> 02:27:04.868]  And we will not allow a regime that chants death to America to gain access to the most deadly weapons on earth.
[02:27:06.343 --> 02:27:09.506]  Today's action sends a critical message.
[02:27:10.447 --> 02:27:14.010]  The United States no longer makes empty threats.
[02:27:14.991 --> 02:27:17.153]  When I make promises, I keep them.
[02:27:17.753 --> 02:27:30.004]  In fact, at this very moment, Secretary Pompeo is on his way to North Korea in preparation for my upcoming meeting with Kim Jong-un.
[02:27:31.065 --> 02:27:32.147]  Plans are being made.
[02:27:32.848 --> 02:27:34.190]  Relationships are building.
[02:27:34.891 --> 02:27:36.633]  Hopefully, a deal will happen.
[02:27:36.894 --> 02:27:47.129]  And, with the help of China, South Korea, and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone.
[02:27:48.411 --> 02:28:02.239]  As we exit the Iran deal, we will be working with our allies to find a real, comprehensive, and lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear threat.
[02:28:03.239 --> 02:28:16.986]  This will include efforts to eliminate the threat of Iran's ballistic missile program, to stop its terrorist activities worldwide, and to block its menacing activity across the Middle East.
[02:28:18.257 --> 02:28:22.241]  In the meantime, powerful sanctions will go into full effect.
[02:28:23.241 --> 02:28:32.169]  If the regime continues its nuclear aspirations, it will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.
[02:28:32.189 --> 02:28:33.030]  All right, let's stop right there.
[02:28:33.290 --> 02:28:33.610]  Finally.
[02:28:33.790 --> 02:28:41.437]  We're going to come back with the final summation of the president's speech that we're in near time live, but we're going to break here.
[02:28:41.457 --> 02:28:45.681]  He started it out live, but we are now obviously re-airing what he's already said.
[02:28:46.521 --> 02:28:51.886]  But this was pretty predictable, but let's talk about what's accurate and what he said and what isn't accurate.
[02:28:51.906 --> 02:28:52.806]  From my perspective.
[02:28:52.846 --> 02:28:55.068]  We'll talk about that too on the other side.
[02:28:55.529 --> 02:28:56.690]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[02:29:02.040 --> 02:29:09.725]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarslife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[02:29:10.585 --> 02:29:14.628]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[02:29:15.148 --> 02:29:17.489]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:21.392]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[02:29:22.918 --> 02:29:35.045]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[02:29:35.745 --> 02:29:50.794]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[02:29:51.814 --> 02:29:55.517]  Find out for yourself today at InfowarsStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[02:29:56.077 --> 02:29:57.798]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:29:57.818 --> 02:30:00.060]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:11.367]  I thought I'd have a couple of the Baron 50 Cals in here for TV viewers.
[02:30:12.493 --> 02:30:14.975]  The Pat and Q, we'll set those up here in front for everybody.
[02:30:15.376 --> 02:30:15.876]  Wanna see them?
[02:30:16.697 --> 02:30:19.419]  And that's the, what, the Army or Marine Corps version, right?
[02:30:19.479 --> 02:30:23.383]  And you got the, what the Navy tends to use right there, a little bit short-barreled 50 cal.
[02:30:23.823 --> 02:30:26.025]  We're gonna go to Michael Savage right now and get his take on that.
[02:30:26.045 --> 02:30:27.086]  We're gonna get back into his new book.
[02:30:27.126 --> 02:30:28.527]  Dr. Savage, what do you think of those babies?
[02:30:29.468 --> 02:30:33.772]  I think you guys should come visit San Francisco and we'll take a stroll down Broadway with those guns.
[02:30:34.953 --> 02:30:37.215]  What do you think folks would do if they saw that?
[02:30:38.810 --> 02:30:40.872]  In San Francisco, they probably wouldn't even notice it.
[02:30:41.352 --> 02:30:43.414]  They're so stoned, they wouldn't even notice it.
[02:30:43.574 --> 02:30:53.603]  But first off, the epic moment we're at as a society and a culture, where they are ready to burn everything down just to stop not just Trump, but America's resurgence.
[02:30:53.943 --> 02:30:59.028]  Michael Savage, this is... How do you quantify this moment we're in as a civilization?
[02:30:59.048 --> 02:31:00.729]  And thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:31:01.710 --> 02:31:03.852]  Well, remember, I live in the San Francisco area.
[02:31:03.892 --> 02:31:06.034]  What could be better than this for show topics?
[02:31:06.943 --> 02:31:20.367]  And remember, you say, well, why do you, people keep saying, well, Savage, why do you live in the most psycho leftist area in the world where a maniac like Pelosi the other day said we don't need to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out the drugs, the criminals, the illegals.
[02:31:20.747 --> 02:31:22.367]  She said mow the grass instead.
[02:31:22.547 --> 02:31:24.048]  That's speech, Alex.
[02:31:24.388 --> 02:31:26.168]  Mow the grass instead of building a wall.
[02:31:26.328 --> 02:31:28.569]  And she's not taken out with a butterfly net.
[02:31:28.669 --> 02:31:30.730]  You've got to have a sense of humor about these lunatics.
[02:31:30.850 --> 02:31:32.011]  But they can be dangerous.
[02:31:32.371 --> 02:31:33.272]  I know what it leads to.
[02:31:33.292 --> 02:31:35.153]  The brainwashing is complete.
[02:31:35.333 --> 02:31:36.594]  They don't even know they're crazy.
[02:31:36.674 --> 02:31:37.995]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[02:31:38.015 --> 02:31:39.456]  I wrote that in 2006.
[02:31:39.616 --> 02:31:40.337]  But it was true.
[02:31:40.457 --> 02:31:41.978]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[02:31:42.018 --> 02:31:44.479]  We're living through crazier times than ever, and there's a reason for it.
[02:31:44.639 --> 02:31:47.861]  Alex, I don't know how one man can take so much hatred and so many lies.
[02:31:48.182 --> 02:31:49.803]  We know every president is criticized.
[02:31:50.363 --> 02:31:56.467]  But I've never seen such an organized hate campaign as I do against Donald Trump and anyone who supports him.
[02:31:57.206 --> 02:31:58.307]  Never in my lifetime.
[02:31:58.367 --> 02:32:02.850]  I know there's always been dissension one side and the other, but it's never been this level of insanity.
[02:32:03.490 --> 02:32:07.693]  How this man Trump can take it all is almost a miracle of human nature.
[02:32:08.113 --> 02:32:13.356]  Either he's much stronger than I even thought he was when I backed him from the beginning, or he's decided, you know what?
[02:32:13.396 --> 02:32:13.917]  Screw them.
[02:32:14.357 --> 02:32:15.397]  They want to push me down?
[02:32:15.457 --> 02:32:16.638]  I'll push them down first.
[02:32:17.319 --> 02:32:19.960]  I think his fighting spirit is so strong that he will prevail.
[02:32:20.621 --> 02:32:25.684]  When Trump finally catches his breath and becomes the president that we know he really is,
[02:32:26.614 --> 02:32:28.836]  And he gets the people around him who he needs.
[02:32:29.617 --> 02:32:32.419]  I can pretty much predict what's going to happen to all these scum.
[02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:35.902]  They're going to be on their jets heading to Switzerland or Austria.
[02:32:36.282 --> 02:32:37.764]  They're not going to be in this country, Alex.
[02:32:38.044 --> 02:32:41.467]  The day will come, they'll fuel up their jet and they'll never be seen again.
[02:32:42.370 --> 02:32:43.411]  And that's going to happen, Alex.
[02:32:43.531 --> 02:32:44.472]  It's long overdue.
[02:32:45.112 --> 02:32:46.253]  We've got to support Trump.
[02:32:46.753 --> 02:32:49.675]  As imperfect as he is, he is all we have.
[02:32:49.715 --> 02:32:55.419]  We must not let the lies of the globalist left get to us and make us think he's not exactly... You're right.
[02:32:55.439 --> 02:32:56.039]  He's a champion.
[02:32:56.079 --> 02:32:56.720]  He's a champion.
[02:32:56.740 --> 02:32:58.481]  And just what he's taken, what he's done is amazing.
[02:33:06.166 --> 02:33:08.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.933 --> 02:33:31.238]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.659 --> 02:33:37.963]  Well, I can tell you a lot of what President Trump has said is absolutely true.
[02:33:39.264 --> 02:33:43.046]  Some of what he said is in the eye of the beholder.
[02:33:43.066 --> 02:33:44.467]  I'm not going to say he's wrong.
[02:33:45.188 --> 02:33:47.610]  And I don't just agree with the President to agree with him.
[02:33:47.690 --> 02:33:49.671]  If he says stuff I don't agree with, I'll say it.
[02:33:50.452 --> 02:33:51.713]  A lot of it's perspective.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:55.581]  I can see what he's doing here.
[02:33:56.501 --> 02:33:59.162]  He's saying, if you don't come to the table right now, the sanctions are coming.
[02:34:00.523 --> 02:34:01.243]  That's a good thing.
[02:34:01.283 --> 02:34:04.125]  I thought they might announce them today, which would really escalate things.
[02:34:04.185 --> 02:34:06.086]  So he's really trying to get him to the table.
[02:34:06.106 --> 02:34:13.629]  I'm going to break down from deep research what's really going on as soon as we finish the president's statement that he just concluded.
[02:34:14.189 --> 02:34:18.091]  So let's go back to the time machine from four minutes ago and go back to the president.
[02:34:18.817 --> 02:34:20.278]  Nuclear aspirations.
[02:34:21.079 --> 02:34:25.704]  It will have bigger problems than it has ever had before.
[02:34:26.745 --> 02:34:31.509]  Finally, I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran.
[02:34:32.785 --> 02:34:34.807]  The people of America stand with you.
[02:34:35.507 --> 02:34:43.134]  It has now been almost 40 years since this dictatorship seized power and took a proud nation hostage.
[02:34:44.074 --> 02:34:55.203]  Most of Iran's 80 million citizens have sadly never known an Iran that prospered in peace with its neighbors and commanded the admiration of the world.
[02:34:56.064 --> 02:35:00.847]  But the future of Iran belongs to its people.
[02:35:01.947 --> 02:35:06.390]  They are the rightful heirs to a rich culture and an ancient land.
[02:35:07.170 --> 02:35:15.655]  And they deserve a nation that does justice to their dreams, honor to their history, and glory to God.
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:23.144]  Iran's leaders will naturally say that they refuse to negotiate a new deal.
[02:35:23.685 --> 02:35:24.646]  They refuse.
[02:35:25.406 --> 02:35:26.207]  And that's fine.
[02:35:26.427 --> 02:35:30.310]  I'd probably say the same thing if I was in their position.
[02:35:31.397 --> 02:35:36.804]  But the fact is, they are going to want to make a new and lasting deal.
[02:35:37.605 --> 02:35:41.189]  One that benefits all of Iran and the Iranian people.
[02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:46.375]  When they do, I am ready, willing, and able.
[02:35:47.176 --> 02:35:57.561]  Great things can happen for Iran, and great things can happen for the peace and stability that we all want in the Middle East.
[02:35:58.702 --> 02:36:03.024]  There has been enough suffering, death, and destruction.
[02:36:03.984 --> 02:36:04.985]  Let it end now.
[02:36:05.845 --> 02:36:06.366]  Thank you.
[02:36:06.886 --> 02:36:07.546]  God bless you.
[02:36:08.447 --> 02:36:08.767]  Thank you.
[02:36:17.008 --> 02:36:18.429]  And then now he's going to sign exiting.
[02:36:27.294 --> 02:36:30.015]  OK, I've got seven notes here I want to go over.
[02:36:31.516 --> 02:36:32.997]  Now the president just concluded that.
[02:36:33.617 --> 02:36:34.377]  And I'm going to say this.
[02:36:34.397 --> 02:36:39.120]  I'm going to give the president the benefit of the doubt because he's gotten North Korea to the table.
[02:36:40.563 --> 02:36:45.185]  I do think the dictatorship by the mullahs is a bad thing.
[02:36:45.865 --> 02:36:49.207]  It's true that more than half their population is below the age of 25.
[02:36:49.867 --> 02:36:53.448]  It's true that in international polls of Iranians, they don't like the mullahs.
[02:36:54.629 --> 02:37:03.493]  It's true that Linda Sorsor is funded by Saudi Arabian controlled groups and others, and she told the Iranian women... I want to hear what he has to say about signing this.
[02:37:03.533 --> 02:37:05.233]  Back this up, I'll play the rest in a minute.
[02:37:05.253 --> 02:37:06.294]  Just back it up, we'll go to it in a minute.
[02:37:06.614 --> 02:37:06.994]  No rush.
[02:37:07.534 --> 02:37:08.535]  He said something after he signed it.
[02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:15.704]  It's true that Linda Sorcerer and others, you know, and their women took their burkas off a few months ago and protested and got shot in the street.
[02:37:16.504 --> 02:37:18.346]  Sorcerer said they were basically grandstanding.
[02:37:18.786 --> 02:37:19.606]  Wear your hijab.
[02:37:19.686 --> 02:37:20.087]  Shut up.
[02:37:20.847 --> 02:37:22.608]  That's why, you know, she's George Soros funded.
[02:37:25.170 --> 02:37:27.271]  But let me just go through the speech.
[02:37:27.791 --> 02:37:29.673]  It's true the Iranian people don't want to be under the mullahs.
[02:37:30.441 --> 02:37:31.101]  That part's true.
[02:37:31.742 --> 02:37:37.144]  It's true that he's brought North Korea to the table, and he's now cut North Korea off from Iran, one of their big allies, partially.
[02:37:37.744 --> 02:37:44.827]  It's true that Iran is developing long-range ICBMs that can hit major capitals all over the Northern Hemisphere.
[02:37:45.868 --> 02:37:47.068]  They can already hit Moscow.
[02:37:47.789 --> 02:37:49.189]  They can already hit Paris.
[02:37:49.729 --> 02:37:50.690]  They can already hit Berlin.
[02:37:53.482 --> 02:37:57.666]  It's true that if Iran gets nukes, the word is they already have some, just that they're not deliverable.
[02:37:57.707 --> 02:38:03.713]  That's why you heard him really talk about the ICBMs more than atomic weapons, because that's the big issue is the delivery system.
[02:38:04.814 --> 02:38:11.321]  You notice he talked about a nuke race, and so Saudi Arabia and others are then going to want nuclear weapons, just like Pakistan and India.
[02:38:12.622 --> 02:38:14.464]  Then he talked about spreading terror.
[02:38:15.561 --> 02:38:17.202]  And Hezbollah in the Middle East.
[02:38:17.862 --> 02:38:21.304]  Iran has not really been offensively bombing or blowing anybody up.
[02:38:21.804 --> 02:38:25.246]  I'm not defending Hezbollah, you know, attacking a Marine Corps base 30-something years ago.
[02:38:27.467 --> 02:38:32.009]  They have been fighting ISIS and the whole Arab Spring that Obama and Hillary and McCain funded.
[02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:36.651]  So that's the only area where what Trump said really is inaccurate, and he knows that.
[02:38:36.671 --> 02:38:42.394]  He said it during the campaign that Hillary and McCain and Obama were the founders of ISIS and funded Al-Qaeda, and then it was shameful.
[02:38:44.121 --> 02:38:50.504]  And then of course you've got New York City and family suing Iran for 9-11 when there's no evidence of that.
[02:38:51.124 --> 02:38:52.125]  Saudi Arabia, folks.
[02:38:55.046 --> 02:38:56.667]  Now they're also suing Saudi Arabia as well.
[02:38:57.327 --> 02:38:58.287]  And my heart goes out to them.
[02:39:00.028 --> 02:39:01.589]  We were there day one exposing the whole thing.
[02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:05.331]  But then you've got the lesson of Libya.
[02:39:05.991 --> 02:39:10.073]  Libya, eight years before it was liberated and destroyed and turned over to Al-Qaeda,
[02:39:12.133 --> 02:39:19.495]  Umar Gaddafi stopped terror, worked with the West, Obama said, come in from the dark, invest in the West, let us all in, and they set him up and killed him.
[02:39:21.736 --> 02:39:25.017]  He was calling Obama desperately while the US was bombing him, saying, why'd you do that?
[02:39:25.377 --> 02:39:29.078]  You lied to me in Paris, you lied to me in Germany, you lied in all those meetings.
[02:39:29.358 --> 02:39:32.179]  It was publicly, you said, I mean, I did everything you wanted.
[02:39:32.219 --> 02:39:40.462]  I invested 40 billion in US, French, and other banks, and they took it, which was for the people of Africa.
[02:39:43.328 --> 02:39:46.731]  So when Qaddafi stood up for the Libyan people, he wasn't perfect, they called him a terrorist.
[02:39:47.032 --> 02:39:49.093]  When he came in and did what the West said, they set him up.
[02:39:49.194 --> 02:39:55.219]  So he comes up there saying, work with us, it's going to be beautiful, it's going to be great, it's all going to be happy.
[02:39:55.620 --> 02:39:56.601]  That's what North Korea said.
[02:39:57.922 --> 02:40:00.284]  Promise you won't preemptively attack us if we get rid of the nukes.
[02:40:01.005 --> 02:40:03.267]  And promise you'll pull the US military out of South Korea.
[02:40:04.804 --> 02:40:05.805]  I'm not defending North Korea.
[02:40:05.825 --> 02:40:11.389]  The point is, they know because of Obama and the Clintons that you disarm, you get double-crossed.
[02:40:12.130 --> 02:40:12.850]  Syria did nothing.
[02:40:12.890 --> 02:40:13.531]  Look what happened to them.
[02:40:15.412 --> 02:40:17.314]  So those are the different angles of different pieces.
[02:40:17.374 --> 02:40:18.855]  Was the Iran nuclear deal bad?
[02:40:19.055 --> 02:40:19.355]  Yes.
[02:40:20.136 --> 02:40:24.359]  Was it a $130-something billion scam that Obama got kickbacks on the table from?
[02:40:24.439 --> 02:40:25.179]  That's been confirmed.
[02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:27.361]  The deal's bad.
[02:40:27.401 --> 02:40:28.242]  Trump's right about that.
[02:40:28.462 --> 02:40:31.364]  And it's true that Iran has rhetoric like they're going to blow up Israel.
[02:40:31.764 --> 02:40:32.825]  And I don't want to blow up Israel.
[02:40:32.865 --> 02:40:33.506]  I don't hate Israel.
[02:40:35.222 --> 02:40:36.703]  Is Netanyahu under political pressure?
[02:40:36.723 --> 02:40:38.004]  Does he want a diversion like this?
[02:40:38.064 --> 02:40:38.304]  Yes.
[02:40:39.524 --> 02:40:41.906]  Those are all the pragmatic points that are going on.
[02:40:44.607 --> 02:40:49.310]  It was a good thing that the president did not go ahead with sanctions now.
[02:40:49.350 --> 02:40:50.691]  He's given him a chance to come to the table.
[02:40:51.351 --> 02:40:54.213]  But he's given him already a year and a half, so I don't think he'll give more in a couple weeks.
[02:40:54.873 --> 02:40:59.636]  Right now, let's go ahead and finish up with what he said after the signing.
[02:40:59.676 --> 02:40:59.956]  Here it is.
[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:04.221]  Thank you very much.
[02:41:04.461 --> 02:41:07.623]  This will make America much safer.
[02:41:08.024 --> 02:41:11.627]  Thank you very much.
[02:41:11.647 --> 02:41:11.907]  Thank you.
[02:41:11.947 --> 02:41:14.349]  Secretary Pompeo is right now going to North Korea.
[02:41:14.369 --> 02:41:19.273]  He will be there very shortly in a matter of virtual, probably an hour.
[02:41:20.570 --> 02:41:21.731]  He's got meetings set up.
[02:41:22.031 --> 02:41:23.631]  We have our meetings scheduled.
[02:41:23.651 --> 02:41:24.772]  We have our meetings set.
[02:41:25.272 --> 02:41:26.372]  The location is picked.
[02:41:26.512 --> 02:41:28.493]  The time and date.
[02:41:28.573 --> 02:41:29.334]  Everything is picked.
[02:41:29.554 --> 02:41:31.554]  And we look forward to have a very great success.
[02:41:31.594 --> 02:41:34.496]  We think relationships are building with North Korea.
[02:41:35.016 --> 02:41:36.376]  We'll see how it all works out.
[02:41:36.516 --> 02:41:37.097]  Maybe it will.
[02:41:37.377 --> 02:41:38.017]  Maybe it won't.
[02:41:39.117 --> 02:41:42.879]  But it can be a great thing for North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the entire world.
[02:41:42.919 --> 02:41:43.879]  We hope it all works out.
[02:41:43.939 --> 02:41:44.620]  Thank you very much.
[02:41:47.526 --> 02:41:51.047]  So the president is genuinely trying to bring peace, not globalists.
[02:41:52.248 --> 02:41:53.568]  We'll all soon be finding out.
[02:41:54.449 --> 02:41:55.729]  We will soon be finding out.
[02:41:56.109 --> 02:41:57.610]  It would be a great thing if they are.
[02:41:57.950 --> 02:41:59.011]  We'll soon be finding out.
[02:41:59.031 --> 02:42:00.571]  Thank you very much.
[02:42:00.651 --> 02:42:02.332]  Not globalist destabilization.
[02:42:02.812 --> 02:42:04.333]  Because they want ongoing crisis.
[02:42:04.353 --> 02:42:05.613]  Trump's trying to end all that.
[02:42:06.153 --> 02:42:07.354]  That's why the globalists are so mad.
[02:42:07.394 --> 02:42:09.795]  They want an ongoing strategy of tension.
[02:42:09.835 --> 02:42:11.515]  This is live coverage of the president.
[02:42:12.436 --> 02:42:13.216]  And so there you go.
[02:42:13.356 --> 02:42:14.997]  I've got a bunch of final news I want to hit.
[02:42:16.041 --> 02:42:18.442]  Matt Bracken took over his hour yesterday.
[02:42:18.482 --> 02:42:19.563]  He's going to be hosting the whole hour.
[02:42:19.583 --> 02:42:24.585]  We're going to have one of our great new reporters in here riding shotgun with him to bring him in and out of breaks.
[02:42:25.245 --> 02:42:29.647]  Savannah, so look forward to her being in here, throwing her right in the deep end.
[02:42:30.308 --> 02:42:31.468]  So that is all coming up.
[02:42:31.548 --> 02:42:34.410]  Again, we're going to be right back with a bunch of news.
[02:42:34.450 --> 02:42:37.691]  I haven't hit a bunch of video clips I haven't gotten to and some breaking news.
[02:42:37.751 --> 02:42:39.332]  It's up on InfoAwards.com.
[02:42:40.192 --> 02:42:40.793]  Straight ahead.
[02:42:41.613 --> 02:42:44.998]  Whatever you do, remember they're trying to censor this radio-splash-TV show.
[02:42:45.498 --> 02:42:50.144]  So wherever you're watching us, it's vital to tell everybody about this is the program the globalists fear.
[02:42:50.244 --> 02:42:51.446]  This is the program they lie about.
[02:42:51.766 --> 02:42:53.428]  This is who Hillary and George Soros hate.
[02:42:53.749 --> 02:42:56.412]  For a reason, because we really tell it like it is.
[02:42:56.813 --> 02:42:59.336]  Not from talking points, but from real research.
[02:42:59.356 --> 02:42:59.797]  Stay with us.
[02:43:02.364 --> 02:43:11.376]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:43:11.456 --> 02:43:19.567]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:43:19.847 --> 02:43:24.549]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[02:43:24.730 --> 02:43:31.433]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:31.513 --> 02:43:38.596]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[02:43:38.697 --> 02:43:45.540]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:43:45.720 --> 02:43:50.066]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[02:43:50.206 --> 02:43:53.470]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:59.718]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[02:43:59.898 --> 02:44:01.560]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[02:44:06.227 --> 02:44:18.057]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[02:44:18.718 --> 02:44:28.045]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[02:44:28.266 --> 02:44:33.070]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[02:44:33.570 --> 02:44:42.879]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:48.444]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[02:44:48.464 --> 02:44:49.966]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[02:44:50.586 --> 02:44:56.888]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[02:44:56.928 --> 02:44:57.748]  Here's my problem.
[02:44:58.249 --> 02:45:06.671]  When I do take the bodies and the X2 and things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear I tend to get mad.
[02:45:07.092 --> 02:45:08.232]  I know, I have the same issue.
[02:45:08.492 --> 02:45:08.672]  Yeah.
[02:45:09.272 --> 02:45:12.113]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[02:45:12.353 --> 02:45:13.874]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[02:45:14.834 --> 02:45:19.860]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:25.446]  This is an incredible time to be alive and I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[02:45:25.626 --> 02:45:29.170]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[02:45:29.451 --> 02:45:31.032]  We went out with the top labs.
[02:45:31.072 --> 02:45:31.933]  We want the strongest
[02:45:32.594 --> 02:45:39.535]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[02:45:39.555 --> 02:45:40.015]  This is key.
[02:45:40.035 --> 02:45:41.856]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem.
[02:45:57.879 --> 02:45:59.279]  And you have inflammation of the brain.
[02:45:59.339 --> 02:46:00.860]  They call that something down the road.
[02:46:00.920 --> 02:46:03.360]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[02:46:03.780 --> 02:46:05.381]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[02:46:05.421 --> 02:46:06.921]  They call that something else down the road.
[02:46:06.941 --> 02:46:12.342]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on and they say, it's inflammation in the brain.
[02:46:12.743 --> 02:46:15.403]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[02:46:15.523 --> 02:46:16.203]  That's exactly right.
[02:46:16.583 --> 02:46:22.205]  Now, your product is an extract and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[02:46:22.425 --> 02:46:26.886]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICPMS mass spec testing.
[02:46:27.506 --> 02:46:30.688]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[02:46:31.049 --> 02:46:36.473]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[02:46:36.513 --> 02:46:38.174]  Well, that's another reason.
[02:46:38.214 --> 02:46:45.219]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals testing if you don't.
[02:46:45.359 --> 02:46:45.759]  Exactly.
[02:46:45.899 --> 02:46:52.784]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[02:46:53.124 --> 02:46:57.627]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[02:47:06.153 --> 02:47:08.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.790 --> 02:47:30.815]  All right, this segment is going to be a blitzkrieg, ladies and gentlemen, of video clips and analysis.
[02:47:32.130 --> 02:47:37.916]  The last one I'm going to get to here in a few minutes is school passes rule that everyone makes cheerleading squad or no one does.
[02:47:37.976 --> 02:47:40.238]  You get a hundred people on the cheerleading squad.
[02:47:41.099 --> 02:47:46.905]  Sarah Sanders annihilates the Washington Post claiming Melania Trump doesn't live at the White House and hates Trump, which is totally untrue.
[02:47:46.925 --> 02:47:48.126]  It's like he didn't want to run for office.
[02:47:48.146 --> 02:47:48.867]  He didn't want to win.
[02:47:49.207 --> 02:47:50.349]  He didn't want to run for re-election.
[02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:51.530]  He didn't want to cut the taxes.
[02:47:51.550 --> 02:47:52.231]  It's just all lies.
[02:47:52.751 --> 02:47:54.532]  Hillary Clinton says she wants to leave the country.
[02:47:54.572 --> 02:48:00.193]  I'm offering, or she's thought about it, I'll buy her the ticket even though she's got all the private jets paid for with her corrupt foundation.
[02:48:00.653 --> 02:48:05.195]  Michelle O says she can't believe women, you know, voted for Trump.
[02:48:05.255 --> 02:48:06.675]  What a condescending witch.
[02:48:07.515 --> 02:48:10.496]  Miracle Boy comes back to life after his parents donated his organs.
[02:48:11.436 --> 02:48:16.198]  But before we do that, again, every week we've got one big special.

[02:48:29.603 --> 02:48:30.623]  The Adult Super Blue.
[02:48:31.904 --> 02:48:38.187]  The Children's Super Blue that doesn't have the really strong peppermint in it, so it's still concentrated, but just doesn't have the peppermint.
[02:48:38.748 --> 02:48:39.228]  The Tea Tree.
[02:48:40.208 --> 02:48:44.691]  And then, of course, we've got the, with colloidal silver and iodine, amazing concentrated mouthwash.

[02:50:07.085 --> 02:50:12.746]  Now, let's get back into those news items that I was mentioning.
[02:50:14.047 --> 02:50:15.807]  Sarah Sanders annihilates
[02:50:16.738 --> 02:50:18.719]  Washington Post, that means Amazon.
[02:50:18.739 --> 02:50:20.420]  When you hear Whole Foods, that means Amazon.
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:23.302]  Melania Trump conspiracy theory.
[02:50:23.622 --> 02:50:24.002]  Here it is.
[02:50:24.022 --> 02:50:26.924]  Let's back that up.
[02:50:26.944 --> 02:50:33.547]  There are persistent rumors that that guy is actually a pig that they put a wig on that they trained to talk.
[02:50:46.363 --> 02:50:49.924]  There's persistent rumors that he can suck a golf ball through a garden hose.
[02:50:49.984 --> 02:50:54.345]  It's the persistent rumors, you know, that he's got Martians in his basement.
[02:50:54.385 --> 02:51:02.568]  Now, none of that's true, but if we just say there's persistent rumors that, you know, Trump's a Russian agent, this is who these people are.
[02:51:02.948 --> 02:51:03.768]  So let's start it over.
[02:51:05.563 --> 02:51:11.886]  Sarah, in this propane story this morning, the Washington Post, among many things, reported that there are... Hit pause again.
[02:51:12.146 --> 02:51:23.913]  You know, the Washington Post put out an article showing this poor lady, Emma Jane Gonzalez, who has the same name as Emma Gonzalez, the shaved head, you know, anti-gunner girl from Parkland.
[02:51:24.893 --> 02:51:25.353]  Tragedy.
[02:51:25.733 --> 02:51:31.996]  And then they say that people learn from me that Emma Gonzalez, the older woman, is a crisis actor and she's been harassed.
[02:51:32.076 --> 02:51:33.617]  I never said anybody was a crisis actor.
[02:51:33.817 --> 02:51:35.678]  I've never heard of this woman, you liars!
[02:51:35.998 --> 02:51:39.320]  You lying, disgusting, filthy Washington Post!
[02:51:39.840 --> 02:51:40.240]  That's it.
[02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:42.481]  I'm going, I'm coming after Whole Foods.
[02:51:42.521 --> 02:51:42.922]  That's it.
[02:51:43.622 --> 02:51:44.522]  I'm going to expose it.
[02:51:44.542 --> 02:51:45.403]  I'm going to bullhorn it.
[02:51:46.243 --> 02:51:48.104]  Bezos, you are a piece of crap.
[02:51:48.804 --> 02:51:49.205]  Excuse me.
[02:51:49.225 --> 02:51:50.525]  Let's go back to lying Washington Post.
[02:51:50.765 --> 02:51:51.426]  Third's the charm.
[02:51:51.466 --> 02:51:52.106]  Play it from the beginning.
[02:51:53.581 --> 02:52:06.798]  Sarah, in this Trump case story this morning, the Washington Post, among many things, reported that there are persistent rumors that Mrs. Trump does not live in this White House, and that she lives with her parents somewhere in the suburbs.
[02:52:06.838 --> 02:52:07.980]  What do you make of those rumors?
[02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:15.183]  I make of the fact that just when you think the Washington Post can't get things any more wrong, they do.
[02:52:15.843 --> 02:52:18.904]  And that that is an outrageous and ridiculous claim.
[02:52:19.224 --> 02:52:21.025]  The First Lady lives here at the White House.
[02:52:21.145 --> 02:52:22.285]  We see her regularly.
[02:52:23.406 --> 02:52:29.468]  And I think that's something that belongs in tabloid gossip, not on the front pages of the Washington Post.
[02:52:29.528 --> 02:52:31.029]  And I hope that they'll do better next time.
[02:52:31.189 --> 02:52:31.409]  Peter.
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:33.421]  And I apologize.
[02:52:33.441 --> 02:52:34.862]  I know we're on so many TV stations.
[02:52:35.122 --> 02:52:35.903]  Other people can do it.
[02:52:36.043 --> 02:52:36.583]  I'm not supposed to.
[02:52:36.603 --> 02:52:37.144]  I apologize.
[02:52:37.204 --> 02:52:37.924]  I will not do that anymore.
[02:52:37.944 --> 02:52:41.747]  I was kind of flipping the bird at that guy.
[02:52:42.067 --> 02:52:45.710]  He makes me so mad because they are a pack of liars!
[02:52:47.151 --> 02:52:54.056]  Can you imagine them saying that I said some woman was an actor and that nothing happened at Parkland and then saying that I'm getting her threatened?
[02:52:54.096 --> 02:52:57.639]  They are complete lying criminals in my view.
[02:52:59.961 --> 02:53:01.222]  Victimizing this poor woman.
[02:53:04.437 --> 02:53:06.238]  I heard a rumor that guy's a flying monkey.
[02:53:06.258 --> 02:53:07.618]  Alright, let's go to the next clip.
[02:53:07.638 --> 02:53:09.839]  I'm gonna be a good boy.
[02:53:09.859 --> 02:53:11.340]  I apologize.
[02:53:11.360 --> 02:53:11.880]  I'm gonna stop.
[02:53:12.261 --> 02:53:13.341]  There's only so much I can take.
[02:53:13.681 --> 02:53:15.902]  Hillary Clinton saying she's given some thought to leaving.
[02:53:16.262 --> 02:53:19.284]  Please, you anti-American globalist, you reanimated corpse.
[02:53:20.244 --> 02:53:21.745]  Carville just announced she's not gonna run again.
[02:53:21.785 --> 02:53:22.505]  Of course she isn't.
[02:53:22.905 --> 02:53:24.086]  She's a walking brain tumor.
[02:53:24.666 --> 02:53:26.287]  Her and John McCain are probably the same person.
[02:53:28.001 --> 02:53:31.324]  I wish no ill upon the dead, but the undead, that's a different story.
[02:53:31.904 --> 02:53:32.885]  Please leave the country.
[02:53:33.045 --> 02:53:36.528]  I will pay for her first class ticket to North Korea or wherever she wants to go.
[02:53:36.588 --> 02:53:37.109]  Here she is.
[02:53:38.010 --> 02:53:45.916]  I want to thank some of you for sending good wishes a very long way during my campaign and the months that followed.
[02:53:46.677 --> 02:53:52.462]  I received a number of invitations from Kiwis to permanently relocate here.
[02:53:55.015 --> 02:53:58.259]  And I must say I really did appreciate the offers.
[02:53:59.120 --> 02:54:00.121]  Gave them some thought.
[02:54:02.123 --> 02:54:08.191]  But I'm going to stay put because we have work to do in my country as well.
[02:54:09.192 --> 02:54:10.514]  This is not your country, witch.
[02:54:14.198 --> 02:54:15.299]  Alright, let's go to the next clip.
[02:54:15.339 --> 02:54:17.682]  Michelle Obama still can't believe women voted for Trump.
[02:54:17.942 --> 02:54:18.843]  The condescension.
[02:54:18.863 --> 02:54:22.767]  Remember the news said, Hillary said, dumb white women, listen to their husbands.
[02:54:23.447 --> 02:54:27.692]  Oh yeah, let me tell ya, the white women are really down on their knees in this country.
[02:54:28.991 --> 02:54:35.594]  Boy, you go to the average house around this country, the women are really, the women are like perched on pink pillows compared to a lot of men.
[02:54:35.614 --> 02:54:36.835]  A lot of men are slobs.
[02:54:37.095 --> 02:54:52.942]  Whatever the point is, the idea that women voted for Trump because their husbands told them to, now that's you and the Democratic Party, like your little buddy, you know, the New York Attorney General and calling women brown slaves and as he savagely rapes them or whatever.
[02:54:53.482 --> 02:54:56.964]  But that's okay because he's a Me Too guy and friends with Cuomo and Soros.
[02:54:57.404 --> 02:54:58.485]  So here's Michelle O.
[02:54:59.773 --> 02:55:12.157]  You know, sorry in light of this last election, I'm concerned about us as women and how we think about ourselves and about each other and what's really going on.
[02:55:12.517 --> 02:55:20.560]  I mean, I think more about what is going on in our heads, will we let that happen?
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:21.720]  You know?
[02:55:21.740 --> 02:55:23.961]  And the economy came back and everything else?
[02:55:23.981 --> 02:55:25.022]  So I do wonder...
[02:55:26.582 --> 02:55:30.184]  Yeah, because like, the illegal alien gets to shoot the woman in the back.
[02:55:30.424 --> 02:55:31.164]  He doesn't get in trouble.
[02:55:31.204 --> 02:55:32.004]  They rape, they kill.
[02:55:32.485 --> 02:55:34.545]  Women are getting murdered all over the place by Islamists.
[02:55:34.865 --> 02:55:37.807]  In Europe, the left says, well, they can't be charged for raping 10-year-old girls.
[02:55:38.347 --> 02:55:39.647]  What's wrong with you, lady?
[02:55:39.908 --> 02:55:42.028]  With Chicago, you run a total hellhole.
[02:55:42.349 --> 02:55:43.209]  You're a monster.
[02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:44.009]  You're a fraud.
[02:55:44.069 --> 02:55:44.850]  You're a scammer.
[02:55:45.930 --> 02:55:47.511]  So yeah, she does wonder what's wrong with women.
[02:55:47.531 --> 02:55:49.271]  Well, there are a lot of women that listen to you.
[02:55:49.311 --> 02:55:49.892]  That's the problem.
[02:55:49.912 --> 02:55:50.212]  Here it is.
[02:55:51.853 --> 02:56:02.000]  I mean, I think more about what is going on in our heads where we let that happen.
[02:56:02.040 --> 02:56:02.580]  Common sense?
[02:56:02.740 --> 02:56:03.161]  You know?
[02:56:05.402 --> 02:56:11.106]  So I do wonder, what are young girls dreaming about if we're still there?
[02:56:11.326 --> 02:56:14.268]  We're not living under you, lady, and you tell them what to eat for lunch.
[02:56:16.696 --> 02:56:18.497]  Running was... Yeah, you're the anointed one.
[02:56:18.517 --> 02:56:20.678]  We're supposed to bat on to you and Harvey Weinstein, your best buddy.
[02:56:20.698 --> 02:56:21.419]  And look what we did.
[02:56:21.439 --> 02:56:22.960]  Alright, get Michael off there.
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:23.860]  Michael, go away.
[02:56:24.581 --> 02:56:26.282]  Now, I mean Michelle, excuse me.
[02:56:27.502 --> 02:56:31.825]  Now, one more clip before we got a break, come back with Matt Bracken.
[02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:36.935]  This is very important because, again, they tell you to turn people off.
[02:56:36.975 --> 02:56:38.317]  You ought to wait a while before you turn them off.
[02:56:38.357 --> 02:56:39.619]  A lot of times, they come back.
[02:56:39.679 --> 02:56:42.383]  My uncle was in a tumor for six months, came back, he's fine today.
[02:56:42.864 --> 02:56:45.688]  Here's a clip about the family and the child.
[02:56:45.768 --> 02:56:47.911]  They'd already decided to turn him off, but then he came back.
[02:56:47.951 --> 02:56:48.272]  Here it is.
[02:56:48.956 --> 02:56:56.360]  Two months ago, Trenton was at a friend's house, sitting in a small utility trailer like this one, while being pulled by a dune buggy.
[02:56:56.580 --> 02:56:59.162]  A day of playing soon turned terrifying.
[02:56:59.302 --> 02:57:05.966]  I flipped, and I hit the concrete, and the trailer landed on top of my head.
[02:57:06.126 --> 02:57:07.807]  After that, I don't remember anything.
[02:57:09.301 --> 02:57:12.004]  Trenton was rushed to USA Medical Center.
[02:57:12.144 --> 02:57:13.926]  He had seven skull fractures.
[02:57:14.066 --> 02:57:17.370]  And all I saw was a stretcher with his feet.
[02:57:17.470 --> 02:57:21.314]  They actually stapled that side shut so they could get him back breathing.
[02:57:21.555 --> 02:57:23.717]  But he was dead a total of 15 minutes.
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:30.485]  When he came back, they said he would never be normal again.
[02:57:34.355 --> 02:57:38.938]  They told me that actually nation palms would be so bad for his brain that he would be a vegetable.
[02:57:39.479 --> 02:57:40.580]  Even if he made it.
[02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:42.221]  We're going to go to break and come back with the rest of it.
[02:57:42.321 --> 02:57:44.442]  But they didn't.
[02:57:44.502 --> 02:57:46.624]  They didn't and he came back and he's fine now.
[02:57:47.044 --> 02:57:47.865]  So remember that.
[02:57:48.245 --> 02:57:49.506]  My dad told me that a long time ago.
[02:57:49.566 --> 02:57:50.767]  All these hospitals will cap you.
[02:57:53.006 --> 02:58:14.728]  If you like the expanded coverage at InfoWars, if you're enjoying the Real News with David Knight in the mornings, the iconic Alex Jones Show midday, and of course the War Room with my colleague Owen Schroyer, please remember that we are completely listener and viewer supported here at InfoWars, and we face the greatest challenge we have ever faced.
[02:58:15.689 --> 02:58:31.060]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:41.488]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[02:58:42.088 --> 02:58:45.230]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[02:58:45.330 --> 02:58:45.590]  Why?
[02:58:45.890 --> 02:58:47.311]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter.
[02:58:47.692 --> 02:58:51.114]  And he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[02:58:51.694 --> 02:58:53.435]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[02:58:53.455 --> 02:58:55.617]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[02:58:55.917 --> 02:59:00.600]  So we need you to go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[02:59:00.640 --> 02:59:10.266]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine
[02:59:10.786 --> 02:59:18.429]  In practice for centuries, combining it with cutting-edge new nutraceuticals to bring you formulas that are really effective.
[02:59:19.029 --> 02:59:21.931]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[02:59:22.391 --> 02:59:28.613]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[02:59:28.893 --> 02:59:31.174]  When you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself.
[02:59:31.595 --> 02:59:33.275]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360-degree win.
[02:59:35.696 --> 02:59:42.400]  You win, and we win, because Alex Jones pumps the money back into InfoWars to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:44.301]  So please, folks, do us a favor.
[02:59:44.541 --> 02:59:45.502]  Do yourself a favor.
[02:59:45.782 --> 02:59:47.223]  Stand up for the First Amendment.
[02:59:47.643 --> 02:59:50.265]  Kick George Soros right in the derriere.
[02:59:50.685 --> 02:59:52.286]  Go to the website now.
[02:59:52.306 --> 02:59:59.810]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.392 --> 03:00:11.414]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:00:13.976 --> 03:00:18.098]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:23.581 --> 03:00:28.084]  When he came back, they said he would never be normal again.
[03:00:31.946 --> 03:00:38.250]  They told me that oxidation problems would be so bad to his brain that he would be a vegetable, even if he made it.
[03:00:38.470 --> 03:00:42.772]  For the next several days, Trenton was brain dead and barely breathing.
[03:00:43.152 --> 03:00:45.634]  His parents faced with a difficult decision.
[03:00:45.654 --> 03:00:48.655]  They signed the papers to donate his organs.
[03:00:48.755 --> 03:00:51.097]  Five kids needed organs that matched him.
[03:00:51.117 --> 03:00:53.358]  And it was unfair to keep bringing him back.
[03:00:55.049 --> 03:00:58.150]  Because it was just damaging his organs even more.
[03:00:58.351 --> 03:01:01.472]  But a day before, doctors were set to pull the plug.
[03:01:02.572 --> 03:01:04.213]  Trenton started coming back.
[03:01:04.693 --> 03:01:06.174]  He believes he was in heaven.
[03:01:06.354 --> 03:01:07.335]  I was walking down.
[03:01:07.695 --> 03:01:10.196]  It was more like an open field, walking straight.
[03:01:10.396 --> 03:01:12.537]  There's no other explanation but God.
[03:01:13.397 --> 03:01:15.979]  There's no other way that I could have came back.
[03:01:16.619 --> 03:01:17.819]  Even the doctors said.
[03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:22.922]  Slowly but surely, Trenton is making strides beyond what anyone expected.
[03:01:23.882 --> 03:01:24.703]  All right!
[03:01:24.783 --> 03:01:25.503]  He's a miracle.
[03:01:25.663 --> 03:01:27.144]  And he just amazes everybody.
[03:01:27.864 --> 03:01:28.485]  Every day.
[03:01:30.906 --> 03:01:39.290]  Now, my dad has been a physician, a Dennis Wilson oral surgeon, and he said when I was growing up, when I was 15, about to get my driver's license, he said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[03:01:40.190 --> 03:01:40.571]  And I said, why?
[03:01:40.591 --> 03:01:44.433]  And he said, well, a lot of hospitals actually won't save you to get the organ.
[03:01:44.453 --> 03:01:45.193]  Some of them are corrupt.
[03:01:45.213 --> 03:01:46.414]  Some of them are making money off of it.
[03:01:46.434 --> 03:01:48.074]  Some of the doctors own part of the hospitals.
[03:01:48.895 --> 03:01:52.757]  And I thought he was full of it until it came out on 60 Minutes about five years later.
[03:01:54.059 --> 03:02:05.145]  And I was sitting at my grandparents' house in Austin watching TV, and they admitted on there that in Austin, Dallas, Chicago, and it listed cities where they were basically letting people die.
[03:02:05.405 --> 03:02:07.146]  I'm not saying this happened in the case of this young man.
[03:02:08.006 --> 03:02:08.786]  So they could get their organs.
[03:02:08.806 --> 03:02:10.527]  They were telling him, his organs are damaged, man.
[03:02:10.547 --> 03:02:11.748]  We need to take him off live sport.
[03:02:12.188 --> 03:02:13.849]  We want to get those organs for somebody else.
[03:02:13.909 --> 03:02:16.730]  But she waited just another day, and he lived.
[03:02:17.911 --> 03:02:20.332]  So I'm telling you, this is something you need to know about.
[03:02:20.792 --> 03:02:21.753]  That's why we covered that.
[03:02:22.816 --> 03:02:24.578]  Now, Savannah Hernandez is one of the new reporters.
[03:02:24.618 --> 03:02:27.461]  She's done some great interviews on the street, done some great reporting.
[03:02:27.481 --> 03:02:28.381]  She's also helping run the show.
[03:02:28.482 --> 03:02:38.511]  And she's going to be here with these guest hosts we have, who are on via Skype, like Matt Bracken, to kind of traffic cop, just in case there's a Skype problem, or to add any breaking news, and to be here in studio.
[03:02:38.531 --> 03:02:39.292]  She's doing a great job.
[03:02:39.632 --> 03:02:40.233]  Been here a few weeks.
[03:02:40.253 --> 03:02:41.094]  We're throwing her the D-pin.
[03:02:41.414 --> 03:02:44.817]  She's doing a great job, and she's going to bring in any news that breaks.
[03:02:45.698 --> 03:02:48.180]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author.
[03:02:48.781 --> 03:02:50.342]  His website's enemiesforeigndomestic.com.
[03:02:50.362 --> 03:02:51.783]  He's going to have a lot to talk about.
[03:02:52.124 --> 03:02:56.568]  Trump's announcement on the Iran deal, what that signifies, and more.
[03:02:57.228 --> 03:03:05.515]  We're going to Matt Bracken here in just a moment, but Savannah, what do you make of that young boy being in a coma and they'd already signed the order to basically let him die, but then he came back?
[03:03:07.437 --> 03:03:08.518]  Oh, it's definitely awful.
[03:03:08.538 --> 03:03:09.199]  Heartbreaking, for sure.
[03:03:10.759 --> 03:03:13.220]  Well, we're going to break all that down when we come back on the other side.
[03:03:13.340 --> 03:03:15.340]  And of course, we've got Matt Bracken here.
[03:03:15.761 --> 03:03:17.121]  Matt, you've got a lot to cover, don't you?
[03:03:18.381 --> 03:03:20.742]  Yeah, it's quite a day of breaking news, that's for sure.
[03:03:22.323 --> 03:03:23.803]  Let me ask you this question before we get a break.
[03:03:24.644 --> 03:03:30.025]  I have a gut-level thing that the left is losing, the globalists are losing, and they're going to strike back.
[03:03:30.065 --> 03:03:31.246]  I mean, I keep going back to that.
[03:03:31.286 --> 03:03:33.606]  I'm really concerned that they're not going to give up.
[03:03:33.927 --> 03:03:34.667]  What do you think?
[03:03:36.263 --> 03:03:37.443]  They totally won't give up.
[03:03:37.463 --> 03:03:49.807]  This has been going on, you know, for nearly a century, this push to globalism, the Kalargi Plan, under many names, and they'll never quit.
[03:03:49.887 --> 03:03:57.289]  You know, there was FDR who was cooperating with Stalin to ensure communism would take over East Europe.
[03:03:57.569 --> 03:03:58.950]  I mean, he literally did that.
[03:03:59.570 --> 03:04:05.812]  Stalin invaded Eastern Europe in American trucks, sent under Lend-Lease as the top priority.
[03:04:06.823 --> 03:04:09.271]  Now we send billions to Iran.
[03:04:10.214 --> 03:04:13.263]  It's sort of a replay of the same theme.
[03:04:14.153 --> 03:04:19.754]  Either naive politicians or corrupt or subverted politicians make deals with our enemies.
[03:04:20.894 --> 03:04:31.337]  All in the name of eventually converging with our enemies in the middle, somewhere between communism and freedom or between Islamism and freedom.
[03:04:31.777 --> 03:04:33.137]  Of course that's foolish.
[03:04:33.777 --> 03:04:35.357]  That's right, that's the UN 7277 public law plan.
[03:04:39.076 --> 03:04:39.716]  All right.
[03:04:39.756 --> 03:04:43.658]  We'll be right back with Matt Bracken and Savannah Hernandez straight ahead.
[03:04:43.678 --> 03:04:45.198]  We're gonna get her mic working.
[03:04:45.238 --> 03:04:47.099]  First time I throw in the deep end, her mic's not working.
[03:04:47.519 --> 03:04:51.581]  They had the whole power go off here last week, so everything's kind of jacked.
[03:04:52.001 --> 03:04:52.721]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:52.841 --> 03:04:54.862]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:04:54.882 --> 03:04:55.402]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.662 --> 03:05:10.743]  Former Secretary of State John Kerry has been having secret meetings with foreign officials to keep the U.S.
[03:05:10.843 --> 03:05:14.344]  in the Iran nuclear deal, and President Trump is not having it.
[03:05:14.724 --> 03:05:28.127]  Kerry was one of the key architects of the Iran deal, which was signed in 2015, and the Boston Globe reported last week that he'd been quietly meeting with Iranian and EU officials in recent months to strategize how to save his legacy.
[03:05:28.507 --> 03:05:36.075]  Trump tweeted, the United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal shadow diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran deal.
[03:05:36.315 --> 03:05:38.958]  He was the one that created this mess in the first place.
[03:05:39.359 --> 03:05:45.805]  President Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal, calling it one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the U.S.
[03:05:45.846 --> 03:05:47.007]  has ever entered into.
[03:05:47.307 --> 03:05:54.489]  Back in February of 2017, President Trump tweeted, Iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S.
[03:05:54.549 --> 03:05:58.449]  came along and gave it a lifeline in the form of the Iran deal.
[03:05:58.469 --> 03:06:00.050]  150 billion dollars.
[03:06:00.610 --> 03:06:09.152]  Leanne McAdoo, InfoWars.com Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:09.652 --> 03:06:14.773]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:20.089 --> 03:06:21.250]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:06:21.370 --> 03:06:22.051]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.171 --> 03:06:22.872]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.952 --> 03:06:23.592]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.612 --> 03:06:26.615]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[03:06:26.735 --> 03:06:36.185]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[03:06:36.225 --> 03:06:37.987]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[03:06:43.217 --> 03:06:46.598]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[03:06:46.638 --> 03:06:46.698]  J.F.
[03:06:46.718 --> 03:06:48.759]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[03:06:48.779 --> 03:06:51.200]  It was almost as if there were a plant imploding.
[03:06:51.280 --> 03:06:51.960]  It just pancaked.
[03:06:52.020 --> 03:06:55.721]  They took the baby out of incubators and left the children to die on the front lawns.
[03:07:00.363 --> 03:07:02.405]  I think this is a national security imperative.
[03:07:02.605 --> 03:07:09.610]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[03:07:09.850 --> 03:07:10.370]  UFOs.
[03:07:11.011 --> 03:07:12.912]  Is this global governance at last?
[03:07:12.932 --> 03:07:14.073]  Is it one world?
[03:07:14.133 --> 03:07:15.514]  The central bank is in charge.
[03:07:15.614 --> 03:07:20.898]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[03:07:21.058 --> 03:07:24.420]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:30.146]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[03:07:30.226 --> 03:07:31.547]  Russian scum!
[03:07:31.627 --> 03:07:32.368]  Denied everything.
[03:07:32.428 --> 03:07:34.330]  He called it all fake news.
[03:07:34.390 --> 03:07:36.912]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[03:07:36.993 --> 03:07:38.954]  This is a national emergency.
[03:07:38.975 --> 03:07:44.700]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[03:07:44.760 --> 03:07:46.262]  This is a FEMA high-level election.
[03:07:50.334 --> 03:07:55.619]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[03:07:55.639 --> 03:07:58.742]  The White House and the President are citing Infowars.
[03:07:59.042 --> 03:08:00.784]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[03:08:01.845 --> 03:08:05.729]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:08:06.630 --> 03:08:08.252]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:10.851 --> 03:08:13.452]  Thanks for tuning in to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:13.512 --> 03:08:19.634]  My name is Savannah Hernandez and we're here with your host today, Matthew Bracken, former Navy SEAL and best-selling author.
[03:08:19.654 --> 03:08:21.495]  How are you doing, Matt?
[03:08:22.495 --> 03:08:24.056]  Pretty good.
[03:08:24.096 --> 03:08:26.477]  This is sort of the blind leading the blind here.
[03:08:26.877 --> 03:08:32.619]  I'm not exactly a pro at this yet either, so if everybody bears with us, we'll stumble through it.
[03:08:33.357 --> 03:08:38.119]  And we'll practice by taking some calls today after I have a few things to say.
[03:08:38.139 --> 03:08:49.103]  And the number to the studio is 877-789-2539 or Alex at the end.
[03:08:49.403 --> 03:08:51.684]  But everybody should have that on the speed dial anyway.
[03:08:52.524 --> 03:08:57.846]  And I want to continue with what we were talking about with Alex before the break.
[03:08:58.610 --> 03:09:02.793]  And that's that what we're seeing today is a is a huge mega battle.
[03:09:02.893 --> 03:09:05.354]  Actually, there are several mega battles being fought.
[03:09:05.914 --> 03:09:13.879]  One, obviously, in Washington, D.C., in the United States, is between Mueller, Rosenstein, Brennan, Clapper, Comey.
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:19.623]  I'll call them the traitors and President Trump and the the swamp drainers.
[03:09:20.283 --> 03:09:24.826]  That's one one obvious axis of this huge war that's going on.
[03:09:25.669 --> 03:09:40.172]  But another one at a much bigger level, the real macro level, is the globalists versus the free people of various nations that just want to remain citizens of their countries and live in freedom.
[03:09:40.993 --> 03:09:48.174]  The people that want to put us into global serfdom, they've had a plan that's been working very well for the last century.
[03:09:49.455 --> 03:09:55.116]  It was really going in parallel with the Bolsheviks in Russia.
[03:09:56.112 --> 03:09:58.834]  Well, we were fighting them in the Cold War.
[03:09:59.594 --> 03:10:02.997]  They were infiltrating us and subverting us from within.
[03:10:03.017 --> 03:10:10.662]  And while we won the military side of the Cold War, the USSR is no longer around.
[03:10:11.643 --> 03:10:16.206]  Their subversive plan worked brilliantly.
[03:10:16.226 --> 03:10:18.748]  And it's not very well understood.
[03:10:19.605 --> 03:10:31.192]  But the Russians, the Soviets, spent more money and put more of their talented manpower into subversion and espionage than they'd ever did into tanks and missiles.
[03:10:31.992 --> 03:10:37.395]  So when we look at the surface level and say, well, we beat them in the Cold War.
[03:10:38.176 --> 03:10:43.719]  How can you say we beat them in the Cold War when you look at our colleges and they're all spewing Marxism?
[03:10:44.519 --> 03:10:48.782]  This is really now coming up the third century of Marxism.
[03:10:49.628 --> 03:10:56.653]  We've just seen the EU put up a giant statue of Marx in Europe that was a gift from the Chinese communists.
[03:10:57.594 --> 03:10:59.736]  The EU is not ashamed of communism.
[03:10:59.796 --> 03:11:02.037]  In fact, they co-opted much of it.
[03:11:03.258 --> 03:11:09.363]  This was called even, you know, for the last 75 years, the convergence theory.
[03:11:09.923 --> 03:11:16.088]  This was American socialists pretending to be American Democrats, but they're socialists.
[03:11:16.875 --> 03:11:28.861]  And they were believing all along that we had to drag America and the USSR together and form a convergent political system that would work globally.
[03:11:29.361 --> 03:11:30.321]  Well, they never quit.
[03:11:30.442 --> 03:11:33.863]  Just because the USSR went away, they never quit.
[03:11:34.483 --> 03:11:35.604]  And we're seeing it now.
[03:11:36.324 --> 03:11:43.728]  And this same type of subversion from within, it's not only in effect with the socialists, you know, the old communists,
[03:11:44.392 --> 03:11:46.737]  We see it today also with the Islamists.
[03:11:47.359 --> 03:11:50.526]  They've been so effective at subverting us from within.
[03:11:50.546 --> 03:11:53.131]  In fact, when Obama came into power,
[03:11:55.204 --> 03:12:19.120]  His new FBI director, Mueller, conducted a purge of FBI and all federal law enforcement training manuals and protocols to eliminate every mention of jihad, of Islamic terrorism, and basically whitewashed it to the point now where American generals who are selected by the Senate
[03:12:19.720 --> 03:12:24.944]  American generals are politically correct pawns of this subversion.
[03:12:25.605 --> 03:12:42.438]  They willingly go along with this mind scrub where there's no danger from Islam and we are going to somehow converge with Islam, the peaceful Islam, which is just the halfway house to being fully Islamified.
[03:12:43.118 --> 03:12:48.102]  So between socialism and Islamism, I think the danger has never been greater.
[03:12:48.914 --> 03:12:53.638]  Today, President Trump threw out John Kerry's Iran deal.
[03:12:54.358 --> 03:13:00.003]  And this is like this is a direct attack at the globalist forces.
[03:13:00.563 --> 03:13:02.665]  This wasn't just the USA and Iran.
[03:13:02.705 --> 03:13:05.547]  This was the USA plus the European powers.
[03:13:06.207 --> 03:13:11.331]  So we're going to we're going to see some kind of a brushback pitch against Trump.
[03:13:11.411 --> 03:13:12.152]  I have no doubt.
[03:13:12.899 --> 03:13:24.161]  And the socialist and Islamist agents of influence within our government and within European governments, they're not working for our behalf.
[03:13:25.301 --> 03:13:35.383]  I would really recommend to people, more than anything else I've read in the last decade, pick up a copy of Diana West's American Betrayal.
[03:13:36.143 --> 03:13:39.444]  It lays it out better than anything I've ever read, chapter and verse.
[03:13:40.577 --> 03:13:42.019]  It's very deep.
[03:13:42.099 --> 03:13:45.642]  This subversion that we've undergone is extremely deep.
[03:13:46.302 --> 03:13:51.026]  The patriots are attacked, and the traitors are praised and protected.
[03:13:51.967 --> 03:13:55.190]  We're seeing it from the Mueller investigation to this Iran deal.
[03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:57.331]  These are very dangerous times.
[03:13:57.992 --> 03:14:04.918]  We need to support President Trump through this, and we can definitely expect the globalist forces to counterattack now.
[03:14:07.060 --> 03:14:10.281]  If we have time, we can go to go to the first caller.
[03:14:12.161 --> 03:14:13.902]  Maybe Alex in Michigan.
[03:14:15.122 --> 03:14:16.462]  We can take him.
[03:14:18.102 --> 03:14:18.743]  First caller.
[03:14:20.283 --> 03:14:20.923]  How are we doing?
[03:14:20.943 --> 03:14:24.364]  Hey, what's going on you guys?
[03:14:25.384 --> 03:14:25.864]  I can hear you.
[03:14:25.884 --> 03:14:27.605]  Can you hear me?
[03:14:27.625 --> 03:14:28.805]  Yep.
[03:14:30.805 --> 03:14:33.846]  I just I would say watch out for false flags and
[03:14:35.583 --> 03:14:38.864]  Classic places like Afghanistan and the Middle East to trigger.
[03:14:41.705 --> 03:14:42.726]  You know the deep state.
[03:14:43.686 --> 03:14:44.626]  Involvement or.
[03:14:45.827 --> 03:14:48.428]  I don't watch out for false flags on both sides, I would say.
[03:14:49.948 --> 03:14:51.609]  And yeah, you're doing a really good job.
[03:14:52.449 --> 03:14:56.351]  Thanks, you know something that's not really mentioned much.
[03:14:56.831 --> 03:14:59.632]  It's spoken of mostly strictly in economic terms.
[03:15:00.686 --> 03:15:22.997]  When we made this deal, when Kerry Obama and Jarrett, who's Iranian, Valerie Jarrett, when they made this deal with Iran, they not only gave billions of dollars, you know, through bank transactions, they gave $1.7 billion in cash, which was plane loads, pallet loads of cash, $100 bills, 100 euro notes.
[03:15:23.758 --> 03:15:28.040]  What people don't really consider very often, I think, is that
[03:15:28.775 --> 03:15:45.022]  Cash, untraceable cash, is the best way that there is to finance terrorism actions, major operations, espionage rings, because a suitcase can be loaded with cash and taken anywhere in a diplomatic pouch.
[03:15:45.362 --> 03:15:51.664]  And Mr. Bracken, we're actually going to go to a short break here, but definitely pick up where we're leaving off right here in the next segment.
[03:15:51.704 --> 03:15:53.965]  This is Savannah Hernandez with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:55.306 --> 03:15:55.846]  Stay with us.
[03:16:05.546 --> 03:16:07.387]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[03:16:07.427 --> 03:16:07.687]  Go ahead.
[03:16:07.827 --> 03:16:11.748]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[03:16:11.848 --> 03:16:16.850]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[03:16:17.410 --> 03:16:22.932]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[03:16:23.832 --> 03:16:32.080]  Still that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[03:16:32.741 --> 03:16:35.624]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[03:16:36.304 --> 03:16:39.928]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, five days a week.
[03:16:40.028 --> 03:16:46.894]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[03:16:47.035 --> 03:16:47.315]  I'm just
[03:16:47.515 --> 03:16:51.637]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[03:16:52.077 --> 03:16:55.358]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[03:16:55.378 --> 03:17:00.300]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[03:17:00.820 --> 03:17:06.402]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[03:17:06.462 --> 03:17:10.964]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[03:17:11.844 --> 03:17:13.146]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[03:17:13.346 --> 03:17:18.712]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[03:17:18.732 --> 03:17:20.053]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[03:17:20.073 --> 03:17:20.193]  Yeah.
[03:17:20.374 --> 03:17:22.236]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[03:17:22.276 --> 03:17:23.097]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[03:17:23.137 --> 03:17:24.818]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[03:17:24.858 --> 03:17:26.040]  We really appreciate you.
[03:17:26.200 --> 03:17:26.881]  Keep up the fight.
[03:17:26.921 --> 03:17:28.322]  We need to take California back.
[03:17:28.342 --> 03:17:28.723]  Thank you, Desiree.
[03:17:28.743 --> 03:17:29.824]  We're going to come back and take more calls.
[03:17:29.884 --> 03:17:30.465]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[03:17:37.461 --> 03:17:46.226]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[03:17:46.646 --> 03:17:54.010]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.

[03:18:28.829 --> 03:18:29.450]  As you age,
[03:18:29.770 --> 03:18:30.210]  We all do.
[03:18:30.450 --> 03:18:34.573]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[03:18:34.593 --> 03:18:36.014]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[03:18:36.235 --> 03:18:40.137]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[03:18:40.177 --> 03:18:47.843]  And again, you look at the studies, testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[03:18:48.670 --> 03:18:57.655]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.

[03:19:37.978 --> 03:19:40.060]  This is Roger Stone for InfoWars.
[03:19:40.560 --> 03:19:48.727]  The left has launched lawfare against Alex Jones, filing a bunch of bogus lawsuits against him that are designed to close InfoWars down.
[03:19:49.067 --> 03:19:51.629]  We need your emergency contribution today.
[03:19:52.050 --> 03:19:55.552]  Go to the InfoWars store and click on the donate button.
[03:19:55.853 --> 03:19:56.954]  We need your help.
[03:20:05.638 --> 03:20:08.500]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.290 --> 03:20:28.958]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:20:32.717 --> 03:20:34.379]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:34.419 --> 03:20:40.726]  This is Savannah Hernandez back with your host, Matt Bracken, best-selling author and former Navy SEAL.
[03:20:42.288 --> 03:20:42.949]  Hey Savannah.
[03:20:43.289 --> 03:20:51.299]  I wanted to mention while I'm thinking about it, since I'm on the show today, I put my first novel into a Kindle free run.
[03:20:51.359 --> 03:20:52.320]  It's this book right here.
[03:20:53.160 --> 03:21:02.833]  This is the original False Flag Black Op Assault Rifle Massacre novel, and you can download it on Kindle right now.
[03:21:02.893 --> 03:21:05.457]  It's my first novel, the one that started it off.
[03:21:06.097 --> 03:21:07.479]  Begins on page one with
[03:21:08.476 --> 03:21:22.087]  With an assault rifle being fired into a stadium, resulting in the banning of all semi-automatic weapons, but it's not done by the, you know, the militia, the deranged militia veteran who's killed at the scene.
[03:21:22.707 --> 03:21:23.848]  He's not the one who did it.
[03:21:23.968 --> 03:21:25.429]  It's a false flag operation.
[03:21:25.869 --> 03:21:29.292]  I think Alex Jones fans will be pretty interested in it.
[03:21:29.893 --> 03:21:35.417]  Anyway, getting back to what I was just speaking about, with Iran and the cash given to Iran,
[03:21:36.514 --> 03:21:54.501]  The 9-11 Commission said that the entire 9-11 attack, which was, you know, the Pentagon, the Twin Towers, and the plane which was aiming, I believe, for the Capitol but went down in Pennsylvania, that entire attack cost $500,000 cash.
[03:21:54.521 --> 03:21:56.662]  And what we did by giving Iran $1.7 billion in cash
[03:22:04.508 --> 03:22:11.252]  was to fund them to the tune of thousands of 9-11 size attacks.
[03:22:11.872 --> 03:22:14.074]  Untraceable cash.
[03:22:14.574 --> 03:22:26.081]  In 1994, Iranian diplomats, this was all unraveled years later, but Iranian diplomats gave cash to Jihad terrorists in Buenos Aires.
[03:22:26.761 --> 03:22:32.485]  They blew up a big Israeli cultural center, Jewish cultural center,
[03:22:33.214 --> 03:22:40.781]  Killed 85, wounded hundreds, basically destroyed an entire city block, a major bombing.
[03:22:41.302 --> 03:22:43.384]  This was done with a diplomatic pouch.
[03:22:44.225 --> 03:22:47.248]  The diplomatic pouch bought the explosives, the cash.
[03:22:47.988 --> 03:22:49.610]  And that's what Obama and Kerry did.
[03:22:49.650 --> 03:22:55.716]  They handed Iran untraceable cash, which can turn up for years to come in the future.
[03:22:57.455 --> 03:23:00.618]  And this long game, this is something we're not used to.
[03:23:00.678 --> 03:23:05.602]  We tend to think in congressional cycles, just get past the next election.
[03:23:06.463 --> 03:23:11.287]  Our enemies think in decades, generations, and even centuries.
[03:23:12.187 --> 03:23:15.950]  The Islamic threat's been going on for 1,400 years.
[03:23:16.611 --> 03:23:18.032]  It has no off switch.
[03:23:18.813 --> 03:23:21.555]  And now it looks like the communists are the same way.
[03:23:22.176 --> 03:23:23.397]  And I'm reminded
[03:23:24.151 --> 03:23:28.335]  Of a book I read a long time ago called Escape from Kolditz.
[03:23:29.015 --> 03:23:38.503]  Kolditz Castle in Germany was a prison for the hardcore escape artists of the mostly British and some Americans.
[03:23:39.564 --> 03:23:52.474]  One of the Brits, his idea was if he couldn't escape, he was going to put jars that would cause dry rot up in the rafters of the castle.
[03:23:53.337 --> 03:23:55.579]  And the other guys said, what are you going to do?
[03:23:55.619 --> 03:23:56.480]  Why are you doing that?
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:23:59.462]  The war is going to be over in a year, a couple years.
[03:24:00.303 --> 03:24:01.804]  You're going to destroy the castle?
[03:24:01.844 --> 03:24:03.806]  He said, yeah, I don't care if the war is over.
[03:24:04.206 --> 03:24:08.189]  I don't care if the castle falls down in 20 years or 50 years.
[03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:09.891]  I'm going to rot it.
[03:24:10.411 --> 03:24:13.093]  I'm going to put rot up into the rafters.
[03:24:13.994 --> 03:24:20.299]  And that's what it looks like the Soviets did, even if they lost the Cold War to the extent that there's no more USSR.
[03:24:21.812 --> 03:24:27.176]  Their most effective weapon was this rot weapon that they introduced inside of the USA.
[03:24:27.796 --> 03:24:35.442]  All you have to do is look at our schools, look at the decadence and the moral corruption, the gender confusion, just go down the list.
[03:24:36.202 --> 03:24:41.566]  Their subversive fighting plan was by far their most effective.
[03:24:42.207 --> 03:24:45.749]  They might not have won, but I think they've destroyed us from within.
[03:24:45.769 --> 03:24:47.310]  And at the same time,
[03:24:48.630 --> 03:24:52.294]  It looks like the jihadists, the Islamists, they've won.
[03:24:52.374 --> 03:25:00.824]  They've purged our law enforcement from any kind of effective counter-jihad training or protocols, policies.
[03:25:01.664 --> 03:25:06.865]  In fact, if you look at what Mueller did, he put blinders on the FBI.
[03:25:06.925 --> 03:25:10.206]  He made it illegal to surveil mosques, for example.
[03:25:10.626 --> 03:25:23.209]  He made it illegal to keep track of these traveling imams, which are, in World War II terms, would be like SS colonels undercover, traveling from mosque to mosque.
[03:25:23.789 --> 03:25:26.370]  He made it illegal to monitor them or track them.
[03:25:27.006 --> 03:25:33.955]  The result was the Boston bombing, San Bernardino, Orlando and Fort Hood and so on.
[03:25:34.476 --> 03:25:41.985]  This wasn't this was done from within by people who are either knowing traders or unwitting dupes.
[03:25:42.666 --> 03:25:44.749]  And my point my point here is to.
[03:25:45.569 --> 03:25:48.930]  Point at these people and call them what they are, which is traitors.
[03:25:49.610 --> 03:25:55.052]  Not to, you know, pussyfoot around anymore, being polite, being politically correct.
[03:25:55.552 --> 03:26:00.453]  We're in a death struggle, and we need to fight back like we're in a death struggle.
[03:26:01.153 --> 03:26:04.334]  Our enemies use our own kindness against us.
[03:26:04.394 --> 03:26:06.135]  They use our politeness as a weapon.
[03:26:06.875 --> 03:26:10.376]  They know that they can backstab us, and we won't even know it's happening.
[03:26:11.656 --> 03:26:13.197]  The meme that's up right now,
[03:26:15.006 --> 03:26:19.811]  The three guys on the bottom were three of the senior American advisors to FDR.
[03:26:20.292 --> 03:26:22.834]  They were all Soviet spies.
[03:26:22.974 --> 03:26:24.436]  They were Soviet agents.
[03:26:25.177 --> 03:26:25.977]  They were corrupt.
[03:26:26.018 --> 03:26:27.619]  They were working for the other side.
[03:26:28.380 --> 03:26:32.064]  And I'm not saying that Brennan Clapper and Comey on top
[03:26:33.111 --> 03:26:34.652]  Obviously, they're not Soviet spies.
[03:26:34.692 --> 03:26:36.153]  There's no more USSR.
[03:26:36.773 --> 03:26:40.295]  But you could say they're deep state or globalist agents, for sure.
[03:26:40.855 --> 03:26:47.059]  They're working against Donald Trump and the Make America Great Again movement.
[03:26:47.559 --> 03:26:53.862]  They're working for this deep state, which is just the American branch of globalism.
[03:26:54.582 --> 03:26:59.405]  So I'm here to say, look, we can't anymore be polite.
[03:27:00.049 --> 03:27:08.131]  If we stay polite and within the acceptable bounds of normal PC behavior, we're going to lose.
[03:27:08.511 --> 03:27:22.334]  We're going to go all the way to the boxcars, to the gulags, unless we start seeing what's going on, calling out our enemies, domestic and foreign, and fighting back hard.
[03:27:23.414 --> 03:27:25.175]  Anyway, that's enough of that rant.
[03:27:26.156 --> 03:27:31.919]  We have a caller from Las Vegas, I believe, that had an interesting, something I hadn't even heard of.
[03:27:32.500 --> 03:27:36.742]  You can put the Vegas caller on now, if we have time.
[03:27:37.963 --> 03:27:38.344]  Go ahead.
[03:27:39.804 --> 03:27:42.086]  Thank you for your service to our country and all you're doing.
[03:27:42.366 --> 03:27:44.347]  I want to point out a story for you folks.
[03:27:44.447 --> 03:27:47.649]  It's not a myth or an illusion.
[03:27:48.150 --> 03:27:50.231]  The Electric Daisy Carnival, 18, 19, and 20.
[03:27:52.492 --> 03:27:53.052]  What is that?
[03:27:53.173 --> 03:28:05.382]  It's a giant rave in the middle of the desert at the racetrack, and 300,000 kids, drug addicts, and gangbangers will all come out there, jump up and down for three days, get high as hell.
[03:28:05.882 --> 03:28:08.705]  Many of them will pass out, and some of them will die.
[03:28:08.725 --> 03:28:10.346]  It's happened three years in a row.
[03:28:10.386 --> 03:28:15.670]  There's always high-level rates of overdoses where they take them to the hospital.
[03:28:15.750 --> 03:28:17.151]  Many of them get treated right there.
[03:28:17.171 --> 03:28:22.175]  The media and the local news keep it down because they like the money, and then people die.
[03:28:22.748 --> 03:28:37.487]  Now here's what I've done is I've called the FBI, DEA, all the neighboring states, and then asked them for emergency to have a lot of law enforcement come into town and try to pop these gangbangers coming in from LA with coolers full of blue pills.
[03:28:38.008 --> 03:28:40.511]  It's literally a drug fest orgy.
[03:28:41.081 --> 03:28:41.802]  Out of control.
[03:28:41.822 --> 03:28:44.567]  And I want to bring attention to who does this.
[03:28:44.707 --> 03:28:45.268]  Live Nation.
[03:28:45.288 --> 03:28:52.479]  So we're actually going to go ahead and take a quick break, but we'll go ahead and pick up with that caller at the beginning of the next segment.
[03:28:52.579 --> 03:28:55.664]  Again, my name is Savannah Hernandez and you're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:02.863 --> 03:29:10.566]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:11.427 --> 03:29:15.468]  From all the wives tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:15.988 --> 03:29:18.329]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:22.231]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:23.755 --> 03:29:35.883]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:36.563 --> 03:29:51.633]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:52.633 --> 03:29:56.336]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for your family.
[03:29:56.896 --> 03:29:58.617]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:58.637 --> 03:30:00.879]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:30:00.999 --> 03:30:11.926]  I thought I'd have a couple of the Barrett 50 Cals in here for TV viewers.
[03:30:13.873 --> 03:30:26.864]  We're gonna go to Michael Savage right now and get his take on that.
[03:30:26.884 --> 03:30:27.905]  We're gonna get back into his new book.
[03:30:27.945 --> 03:30:29.346]  Dr. Savage, what do you think of those babies?
[03:30:30.287 --> 03:30:34.591]  I think you guys should come visit San Francisco and take a stroll down Broadway with those guns.
[03:30:35.772 --> 03:30:38.034]  What do you think folks would do if they saw that?
[03:30:39.626 --> 03:30:41.687]  In San Francisco, they probably wouldn't even notice it.
[03:30:42.167 --> 03:30:44.247]  They're so stoned, they wouldn't even notice it.
[03:30:44.387 --> 03:30:54.370]  But first off, the epic moment we're at as a society and a culture, where they are ready to burn everything down just to stop not just Trump, but America's resurgence.
[03:30:54.770 --> 03:30:59.831]  Michael Savage, this is... How do you quantify this moment we're in as a civilization?
[03:30:59.851 --> 03:31:01.532]  And thank you so much for coming on with us.
[03:31:02.512 --> 03:31:04.652]  Well, remember, I live in the San Francisco area.
[03:31:04.692 --> 03:31:06.833]  What could be better than this for show topics?
[03:31:07.762 --> 03:31:21.186]  And remember, people keep saying, Savage, why do you live in the most psycho leftist area in the world where a maniac like Pelosi the other day said we don't need to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out the drugs, the criminals, the illegals.
[03:31:21.566 --> 03:31:23.166]  She said mow the grass instead.
[03:31:23.386 --> 03:31:24.867]  That's speech, Alex.
[03:31:25.207 --> 03:31:26.987]  Mow the grass instead of building a wall.
[03:31:27.147 --> 03:31:29.388]  And she's not taken out with a butterfly net.
[03:31:29.488 --> 03:31:31.549]  You've got to have a sense of humor about these lunatics.
[03:31:31.669 --> 03:31:32.830]  But they can be dangerous.
[03:31:33.190 --> 03:31:34.090]  I know what it leads to.
[03:31:34.111 --> 03:31:35.971]  The brainwashing is complete.
[03:31:36.152 --> 03:31:37.412]  They don't even know they're crazy.
[03:31:37.492 --> 03:31:38.813]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[03:31:38.833 --> 03:31:40.274]  I wrote that in 2006.
[03:31:40.434 --> 03:31:41.154]  But it was true.
[03:31:41.274 --> 03:31:42.795]  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[03:31:42.835 --> 03:31:45.296]  We're living through crazier times than ever, and there's a reason for it.
[03:31:45.457 --> 03:31:48.678]  Alex, I don't know how one man can take so much hatred and so many lies.
[03:31:48.998 --> 03:31:50.619]  We know every president is criticized.
[03:31:51.180 --> 03:31:57.283]  But I've never seen such an organized hate campaign as I do against Donald Trump and anyone who supports him.
[03:31:58.031 --> 03:31:59.112]  Never in my lifetime.
[03:31:59.192 --> 03:32:03.673]  I know there's always been dissension one side and the other, but it's never been this level of insanity.
[03:32:04.314 --> 03:32:08.495]  How this man Trump can take it all is almost a miracle of human nature.
[03:32:08.515 --> 03:32:14.158]  Either he's much stronger than I even thought he was when I backed him from the beginning, or he's decided, you know what?
[03:32:14.218 --> 03:32:14.738]  Screw them.
[03:32:15.178 --> 03:32:16.219]  They want to push me down?
[03:32:16.259 --> 03:32:17.459]  I'll push them down first.
[03:32:18.119 --> 03:32:20.781]  I think his fighting spirit is so strong that he will prevail.
[03:32:21.421 --> 03:32:26.483]  When Trump finally catches his breath and becomes the president that we know he really is,
[03:32:27.433 --> 03:32:29.655]  And he gets the people around him who he needs.
[03:32:30.436 --> 03:32:33.258]  I can pretty much predict what's going to happen to all these scum.
[03:32:33.899 --> 03:32:36.721]  They're going to be on their jets heading to Switzerland or Austria.
[03:32:37.101 --> 03:32:38.583]  They're not going to be in this country, Alex.
[03:32:38.863 --> 03:32:42.286]  The day will come, they'll fuel up their jet and they'll never be seen again.
[03:32:43.189 --> 03:32:44.229]  And that's going to happen, Alex.
[03:32:44.349 --> 03:32:45.290]  It's long overdue.
[03:32:45.930 --> 03:32:49.211]  We got to support Trump as imperfect as he is.
[03:32:49.551 --> 03:32:50.491]  He is all we have.
[03:32:50.531 --> 03:32:56.112]  We must not let the lies of the globalist left get to us and make us think he's not right.
[03:32:56.132 --> 03:32:56.832]  He's a champion.
[03:32:56.892 --> 03:32:57.533]  He's a champion.
[03:32:57.553 --> 03:32:59.293]  And just what he's taken, what he's done is amazing.
[03:33:06.635 --> 03:33:09.256]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:42.000 --> 03:33:44.502]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:44.542 --> 03:33:48.404]  This is Savannah Hernandez and we're back with your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:49.785 --> 03:33:58.972]  Hi, the number to call in is 877-789-2539 or that's Alex, the last four.
[03:33:59.732 --> 03:34:03.355]  We're talking to Frank in Las Vegas about this Electric Daisy Carnival.
[03:34:04.193 --> 03:34:08.797]  And yeah, I mean, it's to me, it's it's people will make money off of whatever.
[03:34:08.837 --> 03:34:13.320]  I mean, they would if slavery was legal, there'd be people in chains being marched out.
[03:34:14.100 --> 03:34:16.963]  And in a sense, this is psychological slavery.
[03:34:18.444 --> 03:34:21.086]  Make making something basically a drug fest in 2018.
[03:34:21.366 --> 03:34:25.229]  You turn on the TV and it's all about the opioid crisis.
[03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:32.414]  Yet people are making money peddling a venue, which is basically an open air drug fest.
[03:34:34.002 --> 03:34:41.386]  To for for kids and I mean, to me it's a sign of the decadence and corruption inside of our culture.
[03:34:41.406 --> 03:34:47.750]  You know, this is that subversion, this tearing down of our our social fabric that's been so successful.
[03:34:48.730 --> 03:34:51.212]  Frank, any any more information on that?
[03:34:52.612 --> 03:34:56.915]  Yes, so the big thing is any volunteers want to come help and inform law enforcement, you're welcome.
[03:34:56.935 --> 03:34:58.015]  Please help save a life.
[03:34:58.135 --> 03:35:00.477]  It's big picture is this live nation.
[03:35:00.557 --> 03:35:02.758]  Michael Rapinoe also controls
[03:35:03.550 --> 03:35:04.531]  Uh, Ticketmaster.
[03:35:04.711 --> 03:35:08.713]  Now, they make hundreds of millions of dollars and are affiliated with the Saudis.
[03:35:09.073 --> 03:35:11.094]  They launder money through a criminal enterprise.
[03:35:11.294 --> 03:35:14.235]  I'm asking the federal government, the President, the U.S.
[03:35:14.295 --> 03:35:18.457]  Attorney General right now to investigate Michael Rapinoe and Live Nation.
[03:35:18.497 --> 03:35:21.499]  They have a monopoly on all the big venues.
[03:35:21.999 --> 03:35:24.140]  October 1st was a Live Nation event.
[03:35:24.620 --> 03:35:28.702]  The people responsible for the deaths are Live Nation and MGM.
[03:35:29.258 --> 03:35:30.219]  I used to live in MGM.
[03:35:30.319 --> 03:35:34.881]  James Murren sold off his stock in advance because he knew trouble was coming.
[03:35:34.941 --> 03:35:38.823]  It was a turf war for this big giant drug dealer.
[03:35:38.943 --> 03:35:49.888]  So all you people that were injured sue Live Nation and James Murren because they allowed dangerous people onto their property and those dangerous people hurt the people there.
[03:35:50.068 --> 03:35:52.929]  That's what you do when you have a country you're responsible for your people.
[03:35:53.309 --> 03:35:56.011]  So it's a big picture and he's a globalist.
[03:35:56.051 --> 03:35:58.672]  He's a friend of George Soros and Hillary Clinton.
[03:35:59.113 --> 03:36:04.536]  We want to bust and expose Michael Rapinoe of Live Nation and end the monopoly of venues.
[03:36:04.996 --> 03:36:07.577]  And the ticket prices are way illegal.
[03:36:07.898 --> 03:36:10.959]  $300 to $900 to jump up and down and get drunk and high.
[03:36:11.559 --> 03:36:13.380]  We've got to expose these criminals.
[03:36:13.641 --> 03:36:14.981]  God bless.
[03:36:15.261 --> 03:36:15.842]  Thanks, Frank.
[03:36:15.902 --> 03:36:17.042]  And people can look into this.
[03:36:17.122 --> 03:36:18.223]  It's all over the Internet.
[03:36:18.243 --> 03:36:23.946]  Just look up Electric Daisy Carnival and do your own research and maybe we can figure out something to do about this.
[03:36:24.913 --> 03:36:28.295]  I'd like to go now to Tom in London.
[03:36:28.375 --> 03:36:29.475]  Is this London, England?
[03:36:30.596 --> 03:36:32.136]  Is that London, England there I'm seeing?
[03:36:32.156 --> 03:36:34.457]  Hi, Matt.
[03:36:34.578 --> 03:36:35.418]  It's London, England.
[03:36:36.799 --> 03:36:38.139]  Back in Blighty.
[03:36:39.580 --> 03:36:41.421]  Back in Blighty, yeah.
[03:36:41.761 --> 03:36:50.745]  About nine months ago, I phoned into the Alex Jones Show and I predicted that the North Korea situation was a smokescreen and the real target was Iran.
[03:36:54.235 --> 03:36:58.779]  Two things are going to happen following Trump's decisions of this week.
[03:36:59.740 --> 03:37:03.163]  He's decided not to go to Pyongyang or to go to North Korea at all.
[03:37:04.004 --> 03:37:07.827]  And he's also decided to withdraw from this Iran deal.
[03:37:09.769 --> 03:37:14.874]  You think he will not have a meeting at the DMZ in Korea?
[03:37:16.435 --> 03:37:17.376]  Well, I don't think so.
[03:37:17.416 --> 03:37:19.538]  I think he's going to go to a third-party country.
[03:37:22.265 --> 03:37:22.645]  I don't know.
[03:37:22.705 --> 03:37:25.506]  I don't think that Kim Jong Un will leave.
[03:37:25.526 --> 03:37:27.707]  Sorry?
[03:37:28.388 --> 03:37:32.189]  I think that the North Korean leader will be afraid to leave North Korea.
[03:37:32.829 --> 03:37:43.994]  He'll meet at the DMZ or he won't meet at all because if he leaves the country, the generals that he leaves behind might think that he's selling them out and there might be a coup at home.
[03:37:44.854 --> 03:37:48.736]  Or if he leaves, he's going to be afraid that he'll be kidnapped or drugged.
[03:37:49.443 --> 03:37:50.823]  Because they've all done these things.
[03:37:50.843 --> 03:37:58.406]  You know, the North Koreans are famous for kidnapping innocent people, dragging them back, and they're also famous for drugging people.
[03:37:58.466 --> 03:38:07.008]  They even used a little dose of cyanide or some kind of nerve gas to conduct an assassination just a few months ago.
[03:38:07.088 --> 03:38:12.250]  So I don't see Kim Jong-un leaving North Korea.
[03:38:12.390 --> 03:38:14.251]  Maybe he'll step into the DMZ.
[03:38:14.751 --> 03:38:17.431]  That's as far as he'll go, I believe.
[03:38:17.471 --> 03:38:19.052]  Well, he went to China recently.
[03:38:21.935 --> 03:38:25.038]  True, but he went by train and he didn't go far into China.
[03:38:27.039 --> 03:38:28.020]  I mean, his own train.
[03:38:28.080 --> 03:38:37.908]  Yeah, I mean, if the meeting is in the DMZ or near North Korea, or in North Korea, I mean, what I was suggesting was that Trump should go to Pyongyang.
[03:38:38.428 --> 03:38:47.356]  Now, what that would do is it would give Kim Jong-un faith, which is a local, it's, you know, you have to understand the culture, it would give him the faith to
[03:38:48.360 --> 03:38:48.821]  I think.
[03:39:20.432 --> 03:39:21.492]  No, that's false.
[03:39:21.673 --> 03:39:22.433]  You don't understand.
[03:39:22.473 --> 03:39:23.474]  This was not a treaty.
[03:39:24.194 --> 03:39:32.160]  What Obama, Kerry, and Valerie Jarrett pulled was just an executive decision which can be undone by the next president.
[03:39:32.641 --> 03:39:35.383]  It was not a treaty which would require two-thirds of the Senate.
[03:39:36.201 --> 03:39:42.867]  A president can declare that all the illegal aliens can stay in the United States.
[03:39:43.328 --> 03:39:45.029]  That's not the same as passing a law.
[03:39:45.350 --> 03:39:48.413]  The next president can just undo it.
[03:39:48.493 --> 03:39:49.534]  I'd like to read something.
[03:39:50.174 --> 03:39:51.175]  I just saw this today.
[03:39:51.195 --> 03:39:55.920]  This is a blogger, a writer named Nyquist.
[03:39:56.596 --> 03:39:57.016]  J.R.
[03:39:57.116 --> 03:40:05.198]  Jeff Nyquist, this is about the North Korean overtures, and it could be applicable also, I think, to Islam equally as well as communism.
[03:40:05.639 --> 03:40:12.360]  This is why I'm really against Trump meeting this guy without extracting immense concessions.
[03:40:12.780 --> 03:40:21.523]  You have to keep in mind, in North Korea currently, there are a couple hundred thousand people in the harshest gulags, as bad as anything under Stalin.
[03:40:22.583 --> 03:40:32.569]  Medical experimentation, horrible physical corporal punishment of entire families, including children and grandchildren of bad comrades.
[03:40:33.330 --> 03:40:36.651]  Let me read this about the recent overtures to Korea.
[03:40:37.412 --> 03:40:43.115]  This was posted on Diana West's blog, but it's by Jeff Nyquist.
[03:40:44.256 --> 03:40:47.218]  It's about, is this real, the Korean overtures?
[03:40:48.417 --> 03:40:52.420]  At first, you cannot talk to the communist because his goal is to destroy you.
[03:40:52.440 --> 03:40:54.481]  I mean, after all, that's what he has said all along.
[03:40:55.222 --> 03:40:59.205]  But eventually, you talk to him and find yourself shaking his hand.
[03:40:59.765 --> 03:41:01.386]  He is a human being, after all.
[03:41:01.766 --> 03:41:02.607]  He is charming.
[03:41:02.787 --> 03:41:04.128]  Why were you ever afraid?
[03:41:04.849 --> 03:41:09.352]  Then you forget that he's a communist, and you forget what communism signifies.
[03:41:10.413 --> 03:41:12.074]  You decide to make deals with him.
[03:41:12.534 --> 03:41:16.617]  You even say he's not really a communist, and he nods his head.
[03:41:17.808 --> 03:41:22.812]  Nearly everyone is happy about the deals you make and the resulting promises of peace.
[03:41:23.332 --> 03:41:25.274]  You are praised by everyone.
[03:41:25.874 --> 03:41:27.035]  It feels so good.
[03:41:27.936 --> 03:41:31.718]  Then you discover that the communists are cheating you in various ways.
[03:41:32.379 --> 03:41:36.162]  Every agreement you signed was broken before the ink was dry.
[03:41:37.062 --> 03:41:43.107]  But you can say nothing because you will look like an idiot for trusting in criminals and murderers.
[03:41:44.011 --> 03:41:51.953]  Everyone who praised these deals and supported you must also remain silent, for nobody wants to appear foolish.
[03:41:53.013 --> 03:41:57.934]  The years pass by and your country grows weaker in relation to the communist power.
[03:41:58.954 --> 03:42:06.756]  You are sufficiently self-deceived that you will fail to realize that enemy agents are inside your own government.
[03:42:08.036 --> 03:42:12.417]  You also fail to notice that they are work inside of your allied governments.
[03:42:13.220 --> 03:42:19.333]  These agents promote each other and destroy the careers of honest public servants.
[03:42:20.235 --> 03:42:24.604]  Anyone who is corrupt or weak falls in line with them, with these agents.
[03:42:25.971 --> 03:42:29.774]  Of course, all this happened because you shook the murderer's hand.
[03:42:29.794 --> 03:42:30.775]  You sat down with a criminal.
[03:42:30.795 --> 03:42:37.179]  Alright, Mr. Brecken, and we are actually going back to a short break, but we will go ahead and pick this back up at the beginning of the next segment.
[03:42:37.480 --> 03:42:38.761]  Stay where you are, InfoWarriors.
[03:42:38.801 --> 03:42:43.324]  We'll be back with your phone calls and to answer more questions during this next segment.
[03:43:02.691 --> 03:43:06.653]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[03:43:06.714 --> 03:43:14.178]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[03:43:14.238 --> 03:43:20.062]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[03:43:23.504 --> 03:43:26.446]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[03:43:27.486 --> 03:43:28.227]  But he didn't give up.
[03:43:29.514 --> 03:43:29.974]  And he won.
[03:43:31.716 --> 03:43:33.117]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[03:43:33.877 --> 03:43:37.981]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall to get a victory.
[03:43:39.221 --> 03:43:42.464]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[03:43:43.565 --> 03:43:44.466]  And they all died.
[03:43:44.706 --> 03:43:46.047]  All 180 plus men.
[03:43:48.108 --> 03:43:51.431]  The seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[03:43:53.032 --> 03:43:57.275]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[03:43:57.456 --> 03:43:59.097]  But I know this.
[03:44:01.620 --> 03:44:06.144]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced.
[03:44:06.784 --> 03:44:14.110]  With this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[03:44:15.091 --> 03:44:21.896]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[03:44:23.396 --> 03:44:27.100]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[03:44:28.021 --> 03:44:35.568]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants, these globalists.
[03:44:37.971 --> 03:44:47.460]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[03:44:49.844 --> 03:44:53.206]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[03:44:54.207 --> 03:44:56.348]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[03:44:56.728 --> 03:44:58.929]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[03:45:00.270 --> 03:45:00.470]  PQQ.
[03:45:00.490 --> 03:45:00.690]  Go Q10.
[03:45:02.944 --> 03:45:10.652]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[03:45:11.052 --> 03:45:23.685]  They sell PQQ in little bottles with a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like 40, 50 bucks for a little bottle.
[03:45:24.773 --> 03:45:26.274]  Think about that.
[03:45:26.354 --> 03:45:27.195]  It's $74 right now.
[03:45:28.116 --> 03:45:33.120]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[03:45:34.100 --> 03:45:35.401]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[03:45:35.441 --> 03:45:43.808]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[03:45:44.128 --> 03:45:45.849]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[03:45:46.850 --> 03:45:52.634]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product.
[03:45:52.654 --> 03:45:53.874]  So I'm not gambled.
[03:45:54.455 --> 03:45:55.315]  I know you want value.
[03:45:55.355 --> 03:45:57.056]  So we've bought even more of it.
[03:45:57.957 --> 03:46:07.122]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:46:07.782 --> 03:46:08.503]  DNA Force.
[03:46:08.583 --> 03:46:09.963]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[03:46:10.084 --> 03:46:11.004]  Thousands of them.
[03:46:11.024 --> 03:46:12.365]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[03:46:12.785 --> 03:46:13.746]  It is dramatic.
[03:46:14.955 --> 03:46:22.742]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[03:46:23.463 --> 03:46:31.990]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[03:46:32.510 --> 03:46:39.076]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[03:46:41.957 --> 03:46:47.559]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[03:46:47.760 --> 03:46:48.220]  That's fine.
[03:46:49.660 --> 03:46:50.701]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[03:46:51.141 --> 03:46:51.821]  I'm funded by you.
[03:46:52.061 --> 03:46:52.942]  So thank you all.
[03:46:53.602 --> 03:46:58.604]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[03:46:59.144 --> 03:47:01.806]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[03:47:06.047 --> 03:47:08.688]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.351 --> 03:47:36.212]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:36.252 --> 03:47:41.415]  This is Savannah Hernandez back with your host Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL and best-selling book author.
[03:47:41.435 --> 03:47:45.258]  Hi, I'm sorry I went long there.
[03:47:45.298 --> 03:47:46.539]  I was a little bit passionate.
[03:47:47.759 --> 03:47:51.842]  I just need to back up a line and finish this because I think it's really important, okay?
[03:47:52.526 --> 03:47:58.490]  We're talking about how a country can become so self-deluded that they sign deals with the devil.
[03:47:59.190 --> 03:48:09.738]  And once they learn that the devil really is the devil, they're so ashamed and embarrassed for making the deal that they pretend outwardly and even to themselves that the devil's not the devil.
[03:48:10.218 --> 03:48:13.060]  So this was by this is by Jeff Nyquist.
[03:48:13.620 --> 03:48:14.281]  Let me finish.
[03:48:15.201 --> 03:48:17.002]  These agents promote each other.
[03:48:17.243 --> 03:48:19.924]  Doesn't that sound like Mueller, Comey, Rosenstein?
[03:48:20.405 --> 03:48:22.226]  They all work behind the scenes.
[03:48:23.107 --> 03:48:26.768]  Making deals with each other, sabotaging our own country.
[03:48:27.908 --> 03:48:32.290]  These agents promote each other and destroy the careers of honest public servants.
[03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:35.911]  Anyone who is corrupt or weak falls in line with them.
[03:48:36.911 --> 03:48:40.852]  Of course, all this happened because you shook this murderer's hand.
[03:48:41.632 --> 03:48:44.493]  You sat down with a criminal and compromised yourself.
[03:48:45.213 --> 03:48:47.994]  You committed a wicked act and called it good.
[03:48:48.594 --> 03:48:50.275]  And posterity will curse you.
[03:48:51.184 --> 03:49:12.186]  We began this under FDR when he was so inflamed to make an alliance with Stalin and converge capitalism and communism that he was willing to hide the facts of the Ukrainian terror famine, of the Great Purges, of the Katyn Forest Massacre of the Polish officers.
[03:49:12.845 --> 03:49:19.109]  These things were actively suppressed, censored, kept out of American consciousness.
[03:49:19.609 --> 03:49:21.330]  We made the deal with the devil.
[03:49:22.090 --> 03:49:35.438]  Lately, we made another deal with the devil with Iran, with paying terrorist murderers cash, trying to somehow turn the devil into a normal nation.
[03:49:36.298 --> 03:49:37.479]  And if Trump
[03:49:38.152 --> 03:49:46.098]  makes a deal with Kim Jong-un that keeps him as the murderer in charge of a vast gulag, this will be a really evil act.
[03:49:46.618 --> 03:49:54.584]  The people who are languishing in suffering in North Korean concentration camps want to hear a call for freedom.
[03:49:55.124 --> 03:50:05.152]  They don't want to see that their dictator has cemented his power for the rest of his life on the basis of some promises which they'll just lie about anyway.
[03:50:05.854 --> 03:50:08.416]  So, I say hold out for freedom.
[03:50:08.816 --> 03:50:14.099]  Shine the light into these gulags and call an evil empire an evil empire.
[03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:17.201]  Don't shake hands with bloody dictators.
[03:50:17.622 --> 03:50:20.944]  Not Mao, not Pol Pot, not Hitler, not Stalin.
[03:50:21.504 --> 03:50:22.485]  Stand for freedom.
[03:50:23.237 --> 03:50:27.499]  Anyway, Tom, I think I did enough on that.
[03:50:28.059 --> 03:50:29.680]  It's time for me to go to another call.
[03:50:30.180 --> 03:50:33.181]  I see Jim's been holding in Florida for a long time.
[03:50:33.761 --> 03:50:35.822]  Can we pick up Jim now?
[03:50:35.862 --> 03:50:36.162]  Thanks.
[03:50:38.103 --> 03:50:38.644]  Thank you, Matt.
[03:50:38.664 --> 03:50:39.184]  How are you doing?
[03:50:40.044 --> 03:50:40.584]  Great, thanks.
[03:50:42.405 --> 03:50:46.407]  I wanted to put an idea on the table for you and fellow InfoWarriors.
[03:50:47.467 --> 03:50:51.589]  Sean Hannity had mentioned on his program that
[03:50:52.170 --> 03:50:56.993]  We know that Hillary's servers were hacked by five foreign entities.
[03:50:57.053 --> 03:51:03.057]  He didn't mention who they were, but he said we know that Hillary's private servers were hacked by five foreign entities.
[03:51:04.058 --> 03:51:05.538]  And then it hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:51:06.359 --> 03:51:14.204]  What if this whole Russian hacking thing was a red herring to cover the fact that that's where the emails came from?
[03:51:14.624 --> 03:51:17.326]  That one of those five agents
[03:51:20.820 --> 03:51:47.507]  Well, I'm still going along with Julian Assange and the people who believe that it's impossible that the emails, the DNC servers were hacked from outside, that the speeds with which they were downloaded shows that it was somebody putting a thumb drive right into a computer right inside the headquarters.
[03:51:48.306 --> 03:51:56.710]  And so it was probably an inside job, possibly, what's his name, Seth Rich, or someone else like him.
[03:51:56.730 --> 03:52:00.932]  And we are into a realm where people will die.
[03:52:00.992 --> 03:52:04.194]  They will do wet works to take care of loose ends.
[03:52:04.995 --> 03:52:14.961]  I think that Michael Hastings was killed to keep him from going after and exposing John Brennan the way he had exposed General Stanley McChrystal.
[03:52:15.601 --> 03:52:22.585]  I think that the truth about the DNC servers is going to be very damning.
[03:52:22.625 --> 03:52:24.646]  The fact that the FBI rolled over
[03:52:25.310 --> 03:52:28.972]  You know, it says on their shield, fidelity, bravery, integrity.
[03:52:29.452 --> 03:52:35.094]  They rolled over and allowed the DNC to hire their own examiners?
[03:52:35.414 --> 03:52:37.035]  I mean, when does that ever happen?
[03:52:37.055 --> 03:52:44.478]  If you're called in by the FBI or the IRS and they say, we'd like to see your computer and you say, that's all right, I think I won't.
[03:52:44.558 --> 03:52:47.580]  I think I'll call my own expert and then I'll let you know what I find out.
[03:52:48.040 --> 03:52:49.240]  See how that goes for you.
[03:52:51.256 --> 03:52:56.099]  I hope that in the next couple of weeks, this inspector general report drops.
[03:52:56.920 --> 03:53:06.125]  The optimistic side of this is that Sessions has just been playing low key in order to prevent any charges that he's a political actor.
[03:53:06.685 --> 03:53:09.547]  But meanwhile, this outside prosecutor, Huber,
[03:53:10.502 --> 03:53:21.667]  Is working with the IG and Horowitz to prepare indictments to come down rapidly after the IG report, which is due out sometime this month, hopefully.
[03:53:22.248 --> 03:53:23.328]  But we'll see.
[03:53:23.428 --> 03:53:24.789]  This is a clash of titans.
[03:53:25.501 --> 03:53:28.782]  What we're seeing in the media is maybe 1%.
[03:53:29.162 --> 03:53:33.104]  It's like looking through a keyhole compared to the real battle that's going on.
[03:53:33.564 --> 03:53:36.165]  This is a civil war within our government.
[03:53:36.745 --> 03:53:41.527]  And on one side are the forces of socialism and globalism.
[03:53:42.087 --> 03:53:43.067]  They'll scoff at that.
[03:53:43.487 --> 03:53:45.648]  They'll say, oh no, I'm a patriotic American.
[03:53:46.268 --> 03:53:46.929]  They're lying.
[03:53:47.169 --> 03:53:50.630]  You have to remember the concept of strategic deception.
[03:53:51.430 --> 03:53:53.751]  The same thing that Muslims call taqiyya.
[03:53:54.409 --> 03:54:02.414]  They believe in their end so much that they believe that it is completely justifiable to lie to our faces.
[03:54:03.094 --> 03:54:05.536]  And because we're honorable people, we'll believe them.
[03:54:06.136 --> 03:54:10.539]  They consider that we're suckers for believing them, that we're marks, that we're sheep.
[03:54:10.899 --> 03:54:13.981]  We're so stupid that we believe liars.
[03:54:14.742 --> 03:54:19.645]  And we need to get rid of that mindset and know what, you know, when liars are lying.
[03:54:20.465 --> 03:54:23.307]  So the people that are conducting this deep state coup,
[03:54:24.216 --> 03:54:25.777]  I hope that they all go to prison.
[03:54:25.817 --> 03:54:27.858]  I hope we find out who killed Seth Rich.
[03:54:28.358 --> 03:54:30.520]  I hope we find out who killed Michael Hasting.
[03:54:31.080 --> 03:54:32.881]  And, you know, many other things like this.
[03:54:33.501 --> 03:54:40.825]  Because, you know, this country is not going to be the free country we think it is if this coup is allowed to succeed.
[03:54:41.626 --> 03:54:45.368]  And, you know, this is an epic battle and it's going on right now.
[03:54:45.928 --> 03:54:49.490]  And the DNC server, that's just one little aspect of it,
[03:54:51.068 --> 03:54:54.469]  You have anything else on that or cover it pretty well?
[03:54:55.870 --> 03:54:56.630]  Jim, you still there?
[03:54:56.650 --> 03:54:58.871]  I think Jim's gone.
[03:55:00.251 --> 03:55:01.932]  I see, Jim, you still there?
[03:55:03.572 --> 03:55:07.934]  Okay, I see Dr. Kelly in Northern California.
[03:55:07.954 --> 03:55:10.635]  Are you on there, sir?
[03:55:11.075 --> 03:55:13.956]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[03:55:14.596 --> 03:55:14.916]  You're welcome.
[03:55:14.936 --> 03:55:20.218]  I really appreciate your work and I wanted to point out a couple of terms.
[03:55:21.118 --> 03:55:26.300]  from the encyclopedias called Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition from 1658.
[03:55:26.480 --> 03:55:48.927]  It's now 360 years old this year, and when I looked up the definition of the word microphone from 1945, it talked about any contrivance that allows you to hear something that normally the normal human hearing wouldn't be able to perceive.
[03:55:49.941 --> 03:56:04.569]  And in the book, Spy Chips, it talked about the ambassador, Avril Harriman, and he was given a gift of the United States shield made of wood from the Soviet or Russian.
[03:56:05.430 --> 03:56:15.135]  And it was utilized as a remote wireless spy technique that was going on during the Cold War.
[03:56:16.997 --> 03:56:19.398]  They had that technology back in 1945.
[03:56:21.659 --> 03:56:25.201]  Well, that was a big plaque.
[03:56:25.301 --> 03:56:26.081]  It was pretty big.
[03:56:26.121 --> 03:56:32.884]  If I recall from the pictures, the thing was like maybe, you know, 18 or 20 inches in diameter and more than an inch thick.
[03:56:33.924 --> 03:56:37.186]  You know, carved wood, embossed, painted, lacquered, all that.
[03:56:38.035 --> 03:56:42.276]  A gift from the Soviet Union containing a transmitting device inside of it.
[03:56:42.336 --> 03:56:50.778]  But that was all pretty primitive then, but they didn't need to do much bugging, to be quite frank with you, because they had so many spies placed within our government.
[03:56:52.019 --> 03:56:56.520]  You know, within Hollywood, within our government, within academia.
[03:56:57.193 --> 03:57:02.921]  They have, even today, the entire subversive plot is pretty tightly wired down.
[03:57:02.981 --> 03:57:09.910]  It's so pervasive that as soon as you start talking about it, you're shouted down with calls of McCarthyism.
[03:57:12.734 --> 03:57:17.918]  All the time we have for today, but thank you so much for hosting this last segment for us of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:18.539 --> 03:57:24.864]  Tune in tomorrow from 11 to 3 for the show and we have Owen Shroyer with the War Room up next.
[03:57:25.185 --> 03:57:26.626]  This has been Savannah Hernandez.
[03:57:26.746 --> 03:57:27.487]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:43.584 --> 03:57:45.005]  We are on the march.
[03:57:45.445 --> 03:57:47.866]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:57:48.386 --> 03:57:51.227]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:52.607 --> 03:57:56.429]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.
[03:57:56.729 --> 03:58:01.691]  Alpha Power helps with a large amount of functions for your body to help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[03:58:01.951 --> 03:58:02.411]  Alpha Power.
[03:58:02.631 --> 03:58:08.193]  It's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[03:58:22.577 --> 03:58:24.919]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[03:58:25.159 --> 03:58:26.841]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[03:58:27.061 --> 03:58:29.683]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible!
[03:58:29.944 --> 03:58:34.488]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time!
[03:58:34.808 --> 03:58:40.894]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[03:58:41.334 --> 03:58:45.838]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[03:58:46.318 --> 03:58:47.459]  That helps with focus, too.
[03:58:47.900 --> 03:58:48.841]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:49.361 --> 03:58:53.485]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars life health products and they're always of supreme quality.
[03:58:53.905 --> 03:58:57.949]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking alpha power.
[03:58:58.229 --> 03:58:59.650]  There's definitely been a change.
