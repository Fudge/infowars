[00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:08.383]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:08.723 --> 00:00:25.756]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:28.718]  36 years ago, this happened.
[00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:30.099]  I had one beer.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.720]  Right?
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.721]  I had one beer.
[00:00:33.922 --> 00:00:35.202]  Well, do you think it was real?
[00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:35.402]  Nope!
[00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:36.243]  It was one beer.
[00:00:36.663 --> 00:00:36.943]  Oh good.
[00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:38.283]  How did you get home?
[00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:39.063]  I don't remember.
[00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:39.804]  How'd you get there?
[00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:40.544]  I don't remember.
[00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:41.304]  Where is the place?
[00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:42.064]  I don't remember.
[00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:43.484]  How many years ago was it?
[00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:43.945]  I don't know.
[00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:45.165]  I don't know.
[00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:47.786]  I don't know!
[00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:50.306]  I don't know!
[00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:53.387]  What neighborhood was it in?
[00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:53.807]  I don't know.
[00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:54.487]  Where's the house?
[00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:54.967]  I don't know.
[00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:57.028]  Upstairs?
[00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:57.748]  Downstairs?
[00:00:57.808 --> 00:00:58.368]  Where was it?
[00:00:58.448 --> 00:00:58.748]  I don't know.
[00:00:58.788 --> 00:00:59.669]  But I had one beer!
[00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:00.729]  That's the only thing I remember.
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.201]  And a man's life is in tatters.
[00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.362]  A man's life is shattered.
[00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:10.983]  His wife is shattered.
[00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:14.925]  His daughters, who are beautiful, incredible young kids.
[00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.726]  They destroy people.
[00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:19.207]  They want to destroy people.
[00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:21.508]  These are really evil people.
[00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:59.496]  You know, for 10 years, I don't know him, I never met him, but I've been hearing there's this guy named Brett Kavanaugh, who is like a perfect person, who's destined for the Supreme Court.
[00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:00.476]  I've heard that for a long time.
[00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:03.337]  And a lot of smart people.
[00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:06.519]  And first in his class at Yale.
[00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:10.997]  Top top in his class at Yale Law School.
[00:02:11.718 --> 00:02:14.222]  He's led like a life that's unbelievable.
[00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:16.225]  He's had no problems.
[00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:17.406]  They've never taken...
[00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:32.354]  It's Wednesday, October 3rd, 2018, just 34 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:38.199]  The globalists, not just here, but across the world, are hanging on to power by their fingernails.
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:49.009]  And in many other areas, they are being ripped free by the tide of liberty and the tide of human awakening, and sucked into the black hole of the past and history.
[00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.331]  The ashes that they came from, they will become again.
[00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:58.392]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen, as we broadcast worldwide.
[00:02:59.232 --> 00:03:09.274]  This is the most hated, most demonized, most lied about broadcast in the world, vaunted for our action against the globalists.
[00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:13.415]  Thanks to you, the listeners, the activists, the heart and soul of this transmission.
[00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:14.735]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:17.136]  I'm going to have open phones yet again today.
[00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:18.536]  We have some special guests as well.
[00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:34.454]  But I gotta tell you, Christina Blasey Ford's story is the most ridiculous, deceptive, flimsy fiasco that I have ever seen.
[00:03:34.574 --> 00:03:36.415]  What a spectacle, and all the polls show it.
[00:03:36.755 --> 00:03:37.896]  We'll be going over those polls.
[00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:46.719]  It shows, even with skewed polls where they sample 10, 15, 20 percent more Democrats in these polls, and they target Democrat voters.
[00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:53.308]  We're seeing 5-10 point boost in battleground states just the last two weeks.
[00:03:53.408 --> 00:03:53.709]  Why?
[00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.250]  Because people hate witch hunts.
[00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:01.233]  And they know past behavior is the most indicative of future behavior.
[00:04:01.314 --> 00:04:07.578]  And there would be other reports over 36 years of Kavanaugh doing bad things.
[00:04:07.878 --> 00:04:16.964]  They don't just suddenly pop up days before he's supposed to get confirmed and you got the Democrats sitting on the eggs, sitting on these eggs they've laid.
[00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:20.098]  And then launching them at the last minute.
[00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:22.178]  So, it's all unraveling.
[00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:33.383]  And of course, one big giant Fox News breaking it, world exclusive, that Soros-funded activists are running up and down the halls, claiming to be victims.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.640]  It's even bigger.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.921]  Next week's news today.
[00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:37.861]  We told you that last week.
[00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:43.043]  Now we have her boyfriend and others coming out saying she flies all over the place.
[00:04:43.083 --> 00:04:44.163]  She's into polygraphs.
[00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.884]  She's an expert psy-opper on how to get around them.
[00:04:46.904 --> 00:04:50.905]  Well, of course, as a mind-control scientist, what do you think she trains the CIA for?
[00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:54.987]  She's an expert at cheating polygraphs.
[00:04:55.047 --> 00:04:56.367]  And who gave her the polygraph?
[00:04:56.787 --> 00:04:58.768]  Was it Mr. Strzok from the FBI?
[00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:17.132]  Imagine 20 years ago if I would have told you that in 2018 a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, would be in control of our media, our government, and that anybody that criticized him would be banned from the internet and even banned from commerce and being able to process credit cards.
[00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:21.156]  Well, Soros bought control of PayPal last month.
[00:05:21.196 --> 00:05:24.198]  And even though we've been working with PayPal for 20 years, they banned us.
[00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:25.399]  But the magic word?
[00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.400]  Hate speech.
[00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:29.883]  Now, if that was a Nazi collaborator, like Soros, it'd be okay.
[00:05:31.084 --> 00:05:32.365]  That's how crazy all this is.
[00:05:32.786 --> 00:05:37.350]  So they're betting that you're just gonna put up with the abuse, like conservatives always do, and just go away.
[00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.671]  But the biggest thing you can do is call Congress, call the White House, call Talk Radio.
[00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:44.432]  Make a big deal out of this because other conservatives are next.
[00:05:44.452 --> 00:05:45.112]  It's already happening.
[00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:52.614]  And with our regular credit card process that we have at InfoWarsTore.com, get in there and get some of the amazing products we've got so you can't lose.
[00:05:52.634 --> 00:05:56.615]  You get great products while you're funding the information war at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:56.895 --> 00:06:00.456]  You can let that old Nazi collaborator Soros tell you to shove it up as you know what.
[00:06:03.493 --> 00:06:05.614]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:06.154 --> 00:06:11.375]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:20.477 --> 00:06:23.298]  We've got Republican senators being death-threatened.
[00:06:24.678 --> 00:06:27.439]  The restaurants where they eat are being threatened with death.
[00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:35.441]  We don't have people coming up and asking serious questions like I did of Marco Rubio, saying, hey, fight censorship here in America.
[00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:40.143]  The media said that I assaulted him when I was pretty polite until he got in my face.
[00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:41.983]  That's not what you see from the Democrats.
[00:06:42.023 --> 00:06:49.306]  They are running up and down the halls, yelling, screaming, calling Mitch McConnell a rapist in the airport.
[00:06:50.446 --> 00:06:52.127]  And people see this hysterical,
[00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.343]  Witch hunt behavior and major pulls we're going to be getting to in the shower in key battleground states.
[00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:16.678]  Like Michigan, like Colorado and other areas show 5 to 10 to 12 to 15 point swings even in Democrat pollster companies where they're already adding a larger sample of Democrats on average about 15%.
[00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:25.182]  That means Trump is probably really at a 65 right now of eligible voters that are polled.
[00:07:25.563 --> 00:07:28.304]  That is unprecedented.
[00:07:29.485 --> 00:07:30.906]  Going into a midterm election.
[00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:38.232]  That's why the Democrats are panicked, like they were with Hillary, saying 98% chance she wins.
[00:07:38.432 --> 00:07:41.074]  Secret New York Times algorithm.
[00:07:42.335 --> 00:07:43.176]  Total garbage.
[00:07:43.976 --> 00:07:46.118]  And so they smell defeat.
[00:07:46.818 --> 00:07:57.387]  But let me tell you, 34 days out, you've got Ryerson, the deadly neurotoxin, sent to Ted Cruz's Houston offices.
[00:07:58.717 --> 00:08:03.758]  You've had attempts to send it to the White House, and attempts to send it to the Pentagon.
[00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:17.462]  And remember, there's a big article on InfoWars.com by Steve Watson, we named the Antifa groups and professors that pledged, you're not safe, we're gonna get you, we're gonna get your family.
[00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:20.923]  We know where you live.
[00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:26.244]  So they are the ones creating this atmosphere.
[00:08:27.762 --> 00:08:30.844]  That's how crazy it is 34 days in.
[00:08:31.825 --> 00:08:51.777]  And the major Antifa groups are pledging, led by university professors and others across the country, and law enforcement in blue cities, that's come out in the Soros documents, to stage violent uprisings if Kavanaugh is confirmed and or particularly, the big red line is, if the Republicans hold onto the House and Senate.
[00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.579]  And currently, I believe they're going to have major gains.
[00:08:55.739 --> 00:08:56.420]  You heard that here.
[00:08:57.486 --> 00:09:03.689]  Unless, unless we just let them engage in total election fraud.
[00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:05.489]  And remember what the states reported.
[00:09:05.629 --> 00:09:11.692]  Hillary stole at least five states and she tried to steal six others.
[00:09:11.772 --> 00:09:17.754]  They reported Obama's Homeland Security had computers, as they could see the IP addresses, breaking into the state computers.
[00:09:18.334 --> 00:09:21.576]  But at the state level and the county level, people were able to block it.
[00:09:22.423 --> 00:09:34.066]  So it is critical to not have the machines in your area plugged into the internet and to reboot them and wipe them the day of the election because you know Soros owns about half the machines in the country.
[00:09:35.426 --> 00:09:44.188]  Now remember, last month when this all first broke, we reported that
[00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:51.558]  Christine Blasey Ford, that the main protesters directly work for George Soros.
[00:09:51.738 --> 00:09:52.840]  Paul Joseph Watson article.
[00:09:54.902 --> 00:09:57.285]  Now, weeks later, it's mainstream news.
[00:09:57.625 --> 00:10:01.169]  Folks, I don't just say George Soros is behind this, or George Soros is behind that.
[00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.875]  He's literally behind everything bad, every time I look.
[00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:08.967]  Sexualization of kids, he's behind it.
[00:10:09.407 --> 00:10:10.368]  Open borders, he's behind it.
[00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:11.809]  Bringing in radical Islam, he's behind it.
[00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:17.633]  Pushing weaponized marijuana so strong it puts you into a brain-dead coma, he's behind it.
[00:10:17.953 --> 00:10:21.736]  And I'm not for... Drug war, police state.
[00:10:21.756 --> 00:10:24.598]  I also want you to know that weaponized marijuana has ruined a lot of lives.
[00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:35.525]  So the point is, whatever it is, evil, bankrupting countries, overthrowing nations, sexualizing children, the whole revolution to confuse the sex of children, Soros is a master villain.
[00:10:38.314 --> 00:10:42.796]  And now it's all over the news, Fox exclusive, the protesters all work for Soros.
[00:10:42.976 --> 00:10:44.496]  Of course they do!
[00:10:46.637 --> 00:10:47.617]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:10:49.038 --> 00:10:52.119]  But here's the big news, and I'm going to cover this when we start the next segment.
[00:10:52.339 --> 00:10:53.259]  So I have plenty of time.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:06.444]  We have witnesses to Ford, not just her boyfriend, but others that have come forward that aren't getting any attention.
[00:11:08.453 --> 00:11:09.874]  Saying she loved to fly.
[00:11:09.974 --> 00:11:11.335]  She is a globetrotter.
[00:11:12.355 --> 00:11:13.916]  There isn't a second door on her house.
[00:11:16.418 --> 00:11:16.998]  It's insane.
[00:11:17.058 --> 00:11:18.199]  There's a duplex next door.
[00:11:18.219 --> 00:11:18.799]  It's a duplex.
[00:11:21.281 --> 00:11:21.941]  But it gets worse.
[00:11:23.982 --> 00:11:28.165]  That she trained people how to pass polygraphs.
[00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:30.306]  What do you think Stanford
[00:11:32.262 --> 00:11:42.691]  Psychologists, doctors that work in CIA-funded DARPA programs in false memories and implanting memories.
[00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:44.593]  That's what she's an expert on.
[00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:46.334]  Her published papers!
[00:11:46.895 --> 00:11:48.536]  That's science fiction stuff!
[00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:58.465]  Oh, but then her grandfather, father, brother, brother-in-law, all work high-level CIA.
[00:12:00.754 --> 00:12:13.020]  In international banking, and wait for it, funding covert operations, destabilizing foreign nations, using dirty tricks, we're looking into all of them, and it gets better.
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.780]  Guess what else?
[00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.942]  Their specialty is the Russia dossier.
[00:12:19.863 --> 00:12:20.363]  That's right.
[00:12:24.565 --> 00:12:28.847]  It's like saying it was Al Capone in the Italian Mafia.
[00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:34.094]  Or is the last name Capone Italian?
[00:12:35.074 --> 00:12:36.655]  Or is Alex Jones wearing a grey shirt?
[00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:40.016]  You're watching on TV?
[00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:42.097]  Yes, and a dark brown sports jacket.
[00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:46.018]  Or does that say InfoWars.com behind me?
[00:12:46.358 --> 00:12:48.959]  This is 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:50.120]  In fact, it's beyond that.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.101]  It's holding up a flash card to a three-year-old saying, what's this number?
[00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:55.981]  And they go, it's a 2.
[00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.301]  It's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:10.304]  It's, this woman is a thoroughbred, deep state, Hillary-worshipping, psych-warfare, leftist, cultural saboteur.
[00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:16.745]  I mean, what is her stock in trade?
[00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:20.175]  Have you asked the question, you know, is she a globalist?
[00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:20.895]  Is she an operative?
[00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:22.616]  Do bears live in the woods?
[00:13:25.557 --> 00:13:27.798]  Do bears sleep in the woods?
[00:13:29.439 --> 00:13:30.819]  Do bears crap in the woods?
[00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:31.960]  I don't know.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.461]  Let's put the video back up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:13:37.182 --> 00:13:38.162]  You know the answer to that.
[00:13:38.222 --> 00:13:39.303]  This is ridiculous.
[00:13:41.984 --> 00:13:42.664]  Show me comeback.
[00:13:44.332 --> 00:13:48.613]  There's witnesses that nobody's talking about, not just her boyfriend, on record for many years.
[00:13:50.073 --> 00:14:09.337]  And then you've got the boyfriend of the other woman, and restraining orders, and death-threatening families, and just a bunch of whack job, crazy women professors, just like the other woman, senior professor at Georgetown, saying she wants to kill Kavanaugh, kill all the members of Congress that vote for him, and chop their balls off.
[00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:12.157]  That's right.
[00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:13.138]  Castrate them!
[00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:14.419]  I mean, it's a family show!
[00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:16.660]  They're the ones saying this, and she won't get in trouble.
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.444]  Because these people are wound up into a crazed, foam-at-the-mouth system.
[00:14:30.428 --> 00:14:31.909]  So that's all coming up after the break.
[00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:33.070]  Now, let me just stop right there.
[00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:35.211]  This is the last day.
[00:14:36.312 --> 00:14:38.093]  Maybe another day, because I've got to come up with new specials.
[00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:39.354]  To get.
[00:14:42.836 --> 00:14:50.884]  Our best-selling nootropic for the brain, that in a healthy, good way, gives you incredible energy, clarity, focus.
[00:14:50.944 --> 00:14:51.565]  Everybody loves it.
[00:14:51.845 --> 00:14:53.087]  It overall is the bestseller.
[00:14:54.912 --> 00:14:56.193]  Right up there with X2 and things.
[00:14:56.313 --> 00:15:10.203]  X2 is the most profitable to fund us because it costs more, but Brainforce is overall the number one seller for the number of bottles, but the price is already so low at regular retail compared to leading competitors that are similar formulas.
[00:15:10.223 --> 00:15:14.066]  We just remade the top formulas that are out there, made it even stronger for half the price.
[00:15:14.446 --> 00:15:17.989]  But at $22 right now, 50% off, you cannot beat that deal.
[00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:23.453]  And I've got to end this deal because if not, we will sell out by the middle of December
[00:15:24.733 --> 00:15:25.073]  I think so.
[00:15:47.527 --> 00:15:48.428]  I don't know.
[00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:06.057]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:17.906]  PayPal joining a slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[00:16:18.086 --> 00:16:23.970]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:37.098]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[00:16:37.338 --> 00:16:45.483]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones's revenue sources.
[00:16:45.643 --> 00:16:56.514]  This is of course coming at a time when many at least reports out there of possible censorship of conservative voices and other people in the media has come to light as well so Contessa certainly a story that we're following very closely.
[00:16:56.654 --> 00:17:02.661]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[00:17:02.881 --> 00:17:04.302]  And we're also standing up
[00:17:05.363 --> 00:17:08.064]  To social media censorship.
[00:17:08.084 --> 00:17:08.945]  That's the new thing.
[00:17:09.365 --> 00:17:13.506]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[00:17:13.526 --> 00:17:25.051]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[00:17:25.111 --> 00:17:28.632]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[00:17:28.692 --> 00:17:29.032]  He's out.
[00:17:29.072 --> 00:17:32.634]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:34.675]  And you just can't do that.
[00:17:34.776 --> 00:17:45.666]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:51.552]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate.
[00:17:51.752 --> 00:17:52.213]  Hate speech.
[00:17:52.233 --> 00:17:52.873]  Hate speech.
[00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:53.434]  Hate speech.
[00:17:53.514 --> 00:17:54.134]  Hate speech.
[00:17:54.214 --> 00:17:56.377]  Hate speech and bullying policies.

[00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.421]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.741 --> 00:20:20.449]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.975]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:26.335 --> 00:20:46.062]  So, we know something about the crazed Democrats, the chi-coms that fund them, the anti-American Hollywood scum, whose religion is that they own and run America.
[00:20:46.923 --> 00:20:52.485]  And they would run the country into the ground and destroy it, so that they could feel like they were better than it.
[00:20:53.465 --> 00:20:59.950]  So it is a real issue of people that are projecting their hatred of themselves onto us.
[00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.472]  That's why the globalists are such trash.
[00:21:03.272 --> 00:21:14.841]  Now the hunchback demons up there in Congress, like Cory Booker, and I'm saying he's spiritually hunchback, and Dianne Feinstein and others, have lied the whole time, moved the Gold Post down the road,
[00:21:15.461 --> 00:21:24.928]  And then every time one woman gets discredited, and every witness says, there was never a party, we were never there, they never have any witnesses, but they remember every other little detail.
[00:21:26.469 --> 00:21:29.591]  Except what year it was, and what neighborhood it was, and what house.
[00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:32.851]  They won't move on to a new allegation.
[00:21:33.072 --> 00:21:47.616]  I have seen three different news reports since last week of different letters or phone calls where someone sends a letter, no name, no return address, saying, I saw Kavanaugh rape my daughter in the back of a car 35 years ago.
[00:21:50.637 --> 00:21:51.637]  And then it's all over the news.
[00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:54.738]  Well, I saw the Loch Ness Monster in my toilet this morning.
[00:21:54.758 --> 00:21:56.138]  Don't have any proof of it.
[00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:58.479]  So,
[00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:07.216]  They just move on to the next fraud and now they're just saying whether he's guilty or not, Cory Booker says, we just need to not confirm him.
[00:22:08.157 --> 00:22:09.618]  It's called authoritarianism.
[00:22:10.438 --> 00:22:30.031]  The good news is their bullying and their intimidation is radicalizing even the blue-blood Republicans to understand what a clear and present danger the criminal Democrat Party is allied with the CHICOMs and how their election meddling through Hollywood and the CHICOM funding, and how the CHICOMs are running full-page ads in magazines and newspapers all over this country.
[00:22:32.532 --> 00:22:35.114]  Let's get in to the bombshell proof.
[00:22:35.595 --> 00:22:50.788]  First off, tomorrow's news today, here is a Paul Joseph Watson, September 6th, that's almost a month ago, 2018, man caught paying off Kavanaugh protest, works for Soros funded organization, and is a lawyer.
[00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:51.528]  We name him...
[00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:58.051]  And we name the other Soros operatives who were then drug out by the police.
[00:22:58.832 --> 00:23:02.193]  Look at Fox News, the big exclusive.
[00:23:03.034 --> 00:23:08.336]  Anti-Kavanaugh protesters accosting senators have ties to Soros.
[00:23:09.276 --> 00:23:09.737]  Really?
[00:23:09.757 --> 00:23:10.557]  You think so?
[00:23:10.577 --> 00:23:12.498]  He only spends billions a year trying to overthrow this country.
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.881]  Now, let's move on to the other witnesses.
[00:23:16.442 --> 00:23:19.543]  We don't just have all five of her original witnesses saying it never happened.
[00:23:20.364 --> 00:23:25.967]  And her saying about one of her old friends that said it never happened, oh, she's been sick and dealing with some problems.
[00:23:26.927 --> 00:23:30.369]  And she sent me a letter saying, sorry, talk to my lawyer.
[00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:38.513]  But she said in a statement, under penalty of perjury, felony perjury, that it never happened and she doesn't remember any of it.
[00:23:38.954 --> 00:23:39.374]  Period.
[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.761]  That clip's coming up next segment.
[00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:44.963]  This is going to take this segment the next to go through this.
[00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:49.086]  So, the story is up on Infowars.com.
[00:23:49.126 --> 00:23:50.868]  It's the best boil-down for information liberation.
[00:23:51.468 --> 00:23:52.109]  Bombshell!
[00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:58.934]  Ford's ex-boyfriend says she had no fear of flying or living in enclosed spaces.
[00:23:59.395 --> 00:24:01.576]  Helped friend prep for polygraph.
[00:24:01.756 --> 00:24:08.862]  But when we come back, we have the specific video of her looking down and going, I know nothing about polygraphs.
[00:24:09.162 --> 00:24:10.383]  It's like handing me a Remington
[00:24:11.414 --> 00:24:17.919]  700-308, and I can shoot bullseye at a thousand yards, and I get the gun, first time I shoot bullseye, I go, I know nothing about Remington 700s.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:19.901]  I know nothing about it.
[00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:29.808]  The woman is a psych warfare operative, working in huge DARPA mind control programs.
[00:24:29.848 --> 00:24:30.369]  That's what it is.
[00:24:30.489 --> 00:24:35.633]  Implanting false memories, removing memories, creating false realities, close quote.
[00:24:37.113 --> 00:24:41.814]  What do you think they train operatives to do at the psychology facilities at Stanford?
[00:24:42.354 --> 00:24:43.914]  They train them to beat polygraphs.
[00:24:44.394 --> 00:24:46.535]  One of the first things you get taught to do.
[00:24:47.075 --> 00:24:49.155]  You can read it in the declassified documents.
[00:24:49.535 --> 00:24:50.255]  But there you go!
[00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:52.896]  This lady's connected to the Defense Language School.
[00:24:53.296 --> 00:24:54.596]  Who do you think they're training there?
[00:24:55.116 --> 00:24:57.576]  We got folks in this building that were trained at the Defense Language School.
[00:24:57.997 --> 00:25:00.077]  That's where spooks go to get trained.
[00:25:00.997 --> 00:25:01.797]  Not Easter bunnies.
[00:25:02.517 --> 00:25:05.078]  Not little cutesy baby talking women.
[00:25:05.898 --> 00:25:06.438]  Let's continue.
[00:25:07.867 --> 00:25:08.507]  Bombshell!
[00:25:08.647 --> 00:25:11.208]  And then it goes through all the evidence.
[00:25:11.228 --> 00:25:13.910]  The next segment I'm going to read through all of this.
[00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:19.452]  But let's get to the witnesses that no one's talking about and no one's giving any attention.
[00:25:20.412 --> 00:25:21.573]  Infowars.com.
[00:25:22.553 --> 00:25:23.594]  Travel photos.
[00:25:24.914 --> 00:25:26.875]  Ex-boyfriend sworn statement.
[00:25:26.935 --> 00:25:28.436]  Seals Ford's fate as a liar.
[00:25:30.076 --> 00:25:30.517]  That's right.
[00:25:30.897 --> 00:25:36.259]  She traveled to New Zealand over and over again and thought about relocating there.
[00:25:37.927 --> 00:25:39.128]  There's a globalist for taking that over.
[00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.830]  She went to Hawaii.
[00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:45.352]  She went to all these places recently.
[00:25:47.694 --> 00:25:50.355]  But now she has fears of wide-open places.
[00:25:50.395 --> 00:25:52.977]  That's why she kayaks in the middle of big lakes.
[00:25:54.038 --> 00:25:55.339]  That's why she paddleboards.
[00:25:56.239 --> 00:25:57.900]  It's why she travels.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.623]  We pull this article up, show TV viewers, all the way from the United States to New Zealand.
[00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:07.900]  All of this coming out.
[00:26:09.023 --> 00:26:09.404]  All of this.
[00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:14.258]  Ex-boyfriend of Christy Ford says she wasn't afraid of flying or closed spaces.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:18.380]  And it just goes from there.
[00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.201]  So, who are the other witnesses?
[00:26:20.941 --> 00:26:21.481]  It's her.
[00:26:21.701 --> 00:26:22.401]  It's her record.
[00:26:22.661 --> 00:26:23.282]  It's her history.
[00:26:23.442 --> 00:26:26.682]  They tried to expunge her social media.
[00:26:27.323 --> 00:26:28.943]  They tried to expunge her Stanford record.
[00:26:29.283 --> 00:26:32.044]  They tried to expunge the reviews, but we were able to save a lot of them.
[00:26:32.404 --> 00:26:37.085]  And it turns out, she never once talked about fear of open spaces or fear of travel.
[00:26:37.145 --> 00:26:39.166]  In fact, she traveled the world!
[00:26:40.006 --> 00:26:48.430]  But it turns out, she said, in all these articles, that New Zealand wasn't far enough away, trying to reinvent herself.
[00:26:48.771 --> 00:26:58.236]  But I'd say she's reinvented herself now, as an RU486 operative, writing papers for it, trying to stop Kavanaugh, who might be against it.
[00:26:59.576 --> 00:27:06.200]  And she's done quite a job at Stanford and other universities, working in programs that deal with implanted memories.
[00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:12.485]  But let me tell you, there's not many places you can fly further than to New Zealand.
[00:27:13.846 --> 00:27:15.867]  What is that, a 18-hour flight?
[00:27:15.887 --> 00:27:21.050]  I mean, I guess Bangkok maybe is a little bit further from California?
[00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:23.311]  Maybe the middle of Russia?
[00:27:24.331 --> 00:27:24.812]  I don't know.
[00:27:24.872 --> 00:27:27.893]  The point is, it's about as far away, maybe Antarctica.
[00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:30.135]  Maybe the bottom of the planet.
[00:27:30.195 --> 00:27:33.496]  That's 4,000 or 5,000 miles further for Cupcake.
[00:27:35.097 --> 00:27:36.318]  Maybe the tip of Chile.
[00:27:37.523 --> 00:27:38.788]  Maybe the Horn of Africa.
[00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:39.792]  I don't know.
[00:27:39.812 --> 00:27:40.755]  Maybe Easter Island.
[00:27:43.717 --> 00:27:46.659]  So, oh, it's only 12 hours, 50 minutes, so I guess it's close.
[00:27:46.679 --> 00:27:48.280]  Well, that shows no fear of flying.
[00:27:48.601 --> 00:27:54.085]  Remember, she couldn't fly that last week because they had to dig up some more professors.
[00:27:54.325 --> 00:27:55.506]  And it's all professors.
[00:27:55.926 --> 00:28:00.490]  Oh, a professor that Kavanaugh, no evidence shows, ever knew, who went to Yale with him.
[00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:06.634]  Some other professor says he saw a guy hit in his face and Kavanaugh threw ice on him and the guy got arrested.
[00:28:06.834 --> 00:28:08.476]  Who the hell knows if that's even true?
[00:28:09.901 --> 00:28:19.148]  Oh, and then these other women, their boyfriends and fiancés and people gone public, and said that they had to call the police on one of these other women.
[00:28:21.135 --> 00:28:38.265]  But I know this, I've had them in the media and law firms involved in it from the Democrats make up stories about me and you look at you go, why did they say such weird stories that make no sense because they think if it's some really weird thing that oh it must be true because you wouldn't make something up like that.
[00:28:38.325 --> 00:28:45.649]  Like I'm hopping around the office in swastika shoes and you know saying anti-semitic things and all this other made-up crap.
[00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:52.724]  They just make it up, and then they stick it in their filthy newspapers, and they destroy good people's lives!
[00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:55.530]  These people don't have consciences!
[00:29:02.634 --> 00:29:05.918]  Well, Eric Bolling is here in studio for our Bare Knuckles match.
[00:29:05.958 --> 00:29:07.560]  He already beat me up during the break, so he wins.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.644]  No, but seriously, uh, censored, demonized for no reason like everybody else that's effective.
[00:29:11.664 --> 00:29:19.053]  We'll talk about what it's like to be out of FOX, but more importantly, launching something truly free on CRTV with a politically incorrect name, AMERICA.
[00:29:19.093 --> 00:29:19.934]  So it's good to have you here.
[00:29:20.174 --> 00:29:20.594]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:21.455]  Thank you very much.
[00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:24.277]  We ran into each other at Trump Hotel.
[00:29:24.297 --> 00:29:25.718]  Correct.
[00:29:25.918 --> 00:29:26.618]  I was leaving.
[00:29:26.658 --> 00:29:27.379]  You were coming back.
[00:29:27.419 --> 00:29:31.181]  I think you were coming back from your little tiff with Marco Rubio, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:29:31.641 --> 00:29:34.563]  And I caught you at the bottom of the stairs.
[00:29:34.643 --> 00:29:36.905]  And I said, hey, Alex Jones, let's talk a little bit.
[00:29:36.925 --> 00:29:40.947]  I refresh your memory that about five years ago, you and I had a Twitter war.
[00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:42.749]  I think we were going to fight on the corner.
[00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:47.652]  And I said, I'll tell you what, Jones, I'll meet you on the corner of Park and Lex at 4 o'clock today.
[00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:49.113]  And you're like, OK, I'll be there.
[00:29:49.753 --> 00:29:50.893]  There's no corner of parking lights.
[00:29:50.973 --> 00:29:51.974]  I just want to point that out.
[00:29:52.234 --> 00:30:00.576]  How can we, less than two years in, not be thanking our lucky stars like Trump is a giant leprechaun that craps buckets of gold?
[00:30:01.056 --> 00:30:03.137]  Well, he is doing very well in the economy.
[00:30:03.157 --> 00:30:04.277]  He's doing well in security.
[00:30:04.297 --> 00:30:05.158]  When's the last time we heard from him?
[00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:09.859]  But just saying, he's a giant leprechaun the size of King Kong that sprays fountains of gold out of his ass.
[00:30:11.072 --> 00:30:12.433]  Well, that's your assessment of him.
[00:30:12.454 --> 00:30:16.097]  I think he's a brilliant businessman who brought that to Washington, D.C.
[00:30:16.197 --> 00:30:18.140]  There's a number that's floating around here.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:24.066]  I will tell you, never in my lifetime have I seen growth rate exceed unemployment rate by this wide of a mark.
[00:30:24.146 --> 00:30:24.847]  It's just insane.
[00:30:24.867 --> 00:30:26.168]  3.9% unemployment and 4.2% growth.
[00:30:26.188 --> 00:30:26.368]  That is
[00:30:29.031 --> 00:30:30.571]  Perfect perfection in the economy.
[00:30:30.591 --> 00:30:33.292]  It's fully employed and a robust growing economy.
[00:30:33.312 --> 00:30:36.933]  The guy's doing, he's doing everything right on the economy and on security.
[00:30:37.033 --> 00:30:37.573]  Is he rough?
[00:30:37.993 --> 00:30:38.673]  Is he vulgar?
[00:30:38.793 --> 00:30:39.833]  Is he rough around the edges?
[00:30:39.893 --> 00:30:41.314]  Is he a bulldozer, not a scalpel?
[00:30:41.734 --> 00:30:42.474]  True, yes.
[00:30:42.554 --> 00:30:43.534]  But I'll take the other tip.
[00:30:43.574 --> 00:30:45.315]  Well, he ain't a wrecking ball to get rid of the globalists.
[00:30:45.355 --> 00:30:53.216]  But if you look at all those graphs that his chief economic advisor put out two days ago, he gets elected and they all go straight up, showing that we were artificially being suppressed.
[00:30:53.276 --> 00:30:56.757]  I mean, the Federal Reserve printed five and a half trillion dollars for Obama, nothing for Trump.
[00:30:56.837 --> 00:30:58.057]  Well, people say, oh, is he real?
[00:30:58.177 --> 00:31:00.078]  If he doesn't do this, his name is mud.
[00:31:00.118 --> 00:31:02.439]  If he does it, he's bigger than George Washington.
[00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:05.120]  He'll be on the money 500 years from now on Mars.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:16.563]  Look, so all these people that when they're afraid of him and they're worried he's going to get too big and this whole new Trump form of conservatism is growing in Washington, D.C., they all push back.
[00:31:16.603 --> 00:31:18.444]  They all start to say he's losing his facilities.
[00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:19.444]  He's losing his mind.
[00:31:19.764 --> 00:31:21.466]  The man is sharp as a tack.
[00:31:21.486 --> 00:31:23.868]  Trump's called me like at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:31:23.948 --> 00:31:24.628]  I'm like tired.
[00:31:24.688 --> 00:31:28.272]  He's like smooth, like he's a voice actor that never made a mistake.
[00:31:28.372 --> 00:31:33.436]  And it's like also, I'm like, I said a five-minute conversation and he didn't mumble one time.
[00:31:33.777 --> 00:31:35.418]  I'm like, this is a senile person?
[00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:36.659]  You need a nap?
[00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:36.839]  Nope.
[00:31:36.879 --> 00:31:37.160]  Nap.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.081]  Dude, I don't sleep much.
[00:31:39.101 --> 00:31:39.722]  I'm joking.
[00:31:40.483 --> 00:31:41.464]  Now, you're a pretty muscular guy.
[00:31:41.484 --> 00:31:42.524]  I'm a little bit afraid over here.
[00:31:43.345 --> 00:31:43.906]  Parking Lex.
[00:31:44.586 --> 00:31:44.927]  That's right.
[00:31:46.403 --> 00:31:48.024]  Wait, we'll do the Twitter video.
[00:31:48.044 --> 00:31:48.785]  You want to trade punches?
[00:31:49.325 --> 00:31:49.825]  Which video?
[00:31:50.646 --> 00:31:51.446]  We'll do a Twitter video.
[00:31:51.466 --> 00:31:51.947]  Trade punches.
[00:31:52.387 --> 00:31:53.608]  I bet you'll break my arm.
[00:31:54.168 --> 00:31:54.769]  You want to do it?
[00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:55.549]  You're a hotshot.
[00:31:55.589 --> 00:31:56.450]  Pretty tough guy over there.
[00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.971]  I'm telling you, he's in good shape.
[00:32:00.325 --> 00:32:03.767]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:07.028]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.568 --> 00:32:13.371]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:16.593]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.333 --> 00:32:20.775]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:21.155 --> 00:32:27.219]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:32.583]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.348 --> 00:32:36.749]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:43.812]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.473 --> 00:32:49.155]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.675 --> 00:32:54.797]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.377 --> 00:32:59.339]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.266 --> 00:33:09.471]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.496 --> 00:33:22.761]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[00:33:22.781 --> 00:33:26.204]  I'm a friend of thunder.
[00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:31.027]  Friend as in any wonder, lightning strikes me.
[00:33:34.722 --> 00:33:58.680]  I tell you, when I started talking about Jesus more on air, now this is a spiritual fight, and when I crossed the Rubicon, I don't know, about six, seven years ago, it really wasn't tempted by evil anymore.
[00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:00.222]  By real evil.
[00:34:01.322 --> 00:34:03.104]  That's when the world really started coming after me.
[00:34:04.224 --> 00:34:07.206]  But that's when the doors of the universe began to open up as well.
[00:34:07.746 --> 00:34:09.348]  My relationship with God got even stronger.
[00:34:10.488 --> 00:34:11.109]  It's amazing.
[00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:12.990]  But that's good old Keith Whitley.
[00:34:13.871 --> 00:34:17.373]  That's one of the few guys to give George Strait a run for his money.
[00:34:18.334 --> 00:34:19.414]  And he died young.
[00:34:23.617 --> 00:34:24.618]  That's a really good song.
[00:34:24.638 --> 00:34:26.860]  And I fought with the devil.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.120]  Got down on his level.
[00:34:30.582 --> 00:34:31.503]  But I never gave in.
[00:34:31.523 --> 00:34:32.824]  So he gave up on me.
[00:34:34.147 --> 00:34:35.148]  That's what you want, folks.
[00:34:35.988 --> 00:34:37.729]  You want the devil to give up on you.
[00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.190]  And then you start trying to destroy it.
[00:34:39.390 --> 00:34:41.171]  Because that's when you get close to God.
[00:34:42.372 --> 00:34:44.553]  That's when God starts to move in to your life.
[00:34:45.113 --> 00:34:46.274]  When you really start seeing God.
[00:34:47.374 --> 00:34:50.916]  Now let's get back to the evil we're fighting.
[00:34:51.056 --> 00:34:52.517]  And believe me, it's pure evil, as you know.
[00:34:52.537 --> 00:34:57.340]  And it's going to manifest itself and become that much more obvious, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:08.311]  Ford is a disgusting creation of the deep state.
[00:35:08.911 --> 00:35:12.913]  Her entire male family are spooks.
[00:35:13.973 --> 00:35:20.775]  And they're not like Army or Marine Corps soldiers or officers assigned to real operations.
[00:35:20.835 --> 00:35:23.576]  They're the ones that run our lives.
[00:35:23.676 --> 00:35:26.217]  They're the ones that control the schools.
[00:35:26.237 --> 00:35:29.918]  They're the ones that push Hollywood to inject the poison into our culture.
[00:35:30.745 --> 00:35:32.007]  They're the abortion pushers.
[00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:34.752]  They're the break up the family peddlers.
[00:35:35.593 --> 00:35:37.777]  They're the transgender promoters.
[00:35:40.302 --> 00:35:40.903]  They're the plague.
[00:35:42.042 --> 00:35:42.942]  They're solid death.
[00:35:44.743 --> 00:35:56.288]  You know, I remember reading the John Birch Society, stuff they wrote 50 years ago, about globalist world government operatives inside of the intelligence agencies.
[00:35:57.228 --> 00:36:02.971]  Now they were putting on ugly art and ugly literature and ugly architecture, and now they wanted to destroy the family.
[00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:05.812]  Now they wanted to merge us with China.
[00:36:08.793 --> 00:36:10.394]  Now our government put Mao Zedong in,
[00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:18.930]  All of it turned out to be absolutely dead on, spot on.
[00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.251]  People ask how I'm so dead on.
[00:36:21.271 --> 00:36:35.074]  Well, I had the right foundation because the John Burr Society was founded by patriots in our government that were aware of what was going on and were battling what we know as the globalists today.
[00:36:35.871 --> 00:36:38.333]  And people like Barry Goldwater came out of The Whole Awakening.
[00:36:38.393 --> 00:36:42.475]  Ronald Reagan was fully aware of the Burt Society and informed on that.
[00:36:42.996 --> 00:36:44.877]  And I'm not a member of the John Burt Society.
[00:36:45.417 --> 00:36:50.760]  You know, my dad gave anti-communist speeches and even hosted a radio show when he was in high school in Dallas.
[00:36:51.281 --> 00:36:53.942]  He'd drive up Friday afternoons and tape it.
[00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:55.824]  It was on, I think, WBAP.
[00:36:55.884 --> 00:37:00.827]  But this is what we're dealing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:01.587 --> 00:37:02.468]  And it's the real deal.
[00:37:04.617 --> 00:37:19.122]  And folks need to just get their heads screwed on straight and realize that we're facing a world government corporate system that wants a final revolution, even over the biology between men and women, and to have a total monopoly over reproduction.
[00:37:21.102 --> 00:37:27.504]  Why do you think Colbert, of the hundreds of times he's attacked me, always makes jokes about Jones' claims of putting stuff in the water?
[00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:29.265]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:37:30.865 --> 00:37:32.886]  Because that's their prime operation.
[00:37:34.005 --> 00:37:37.466]  Now you understand that 99% of people in government aren't involved in this.
[00:37:38.526 --> 00:37:50.130]  You understand the President's trying to stop all this and trying to release all the suppressed technologies in energy and in health and in other areas of science and they're blocking him!
[00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:53.911]  He can't even get three levels down to do what he says.
[00:37:59.393 --> 00:38:00.233]  But they made a mistake.
[00:38:02.034 --> 00:38:02.954]  They made a big mistake.
[00:38:05.836 --> 00:38:14.142]  They transferred dictatorial powers to the presidency under Clinton, Bush, and Obama.
[00:38:15.223 --> 00:38:18.886]  And Trump is annihilating them with it right now.
[00:38:20.127 --> 00:38:27.252]  So he can kill their deals and have it revert back to what it was, and just him sticking his foot in the door.
[00:38:27.292 --> 00:38:29.134]  This is the best analogy I've come up with in a long time.
[00:38:30.355 --> 00:38:33.917]  The globalists were closing that big old giant vault door to seal us in.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:35.660]  Our tombs.
[00:38:37.262 --> 00:38:39.203]  And laughing at us the whole time while they did it.
[00:38:42.966 --> 00:38:45.107]  The archetype of supervillains bragging is really true.
[00:38:45.127 --> 00:38:49.010]  I used to always watch movies and cartoons when I was a kid with the supervillains bragging.
[00:38:49.491 --> 00:38:51.952]  And they're like, I wouldn't brag if I was a supervillain.
[00:38:52.473 --> 00:38:54.714]  But that's in the criminal psychology.
[00:38:54.734 --> 00:38:57.897]  The globalists write books and brag and tell you what they're going to do.
[00:38:57.917 --> 00:39:00.418]  Like you're too stupid to even read it or too stupid to stop them.
[00:39:00.659 --> 00:39:02.260]  Now they're not arrogant like that anymore.
[00:39:04.087 --> 00:39:07.171]  They've had those big fat smiles wiped right off their stinking faces.
[00:39:12.257 --> 00:39:18.284]  But, we have their blueprint, we have their operation, we can stop them, and Trump has rammed his foot
[00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:26.962]  in the big door and it's bleeding and it's smashed and he knows though everybody's gonna be slaves.
[00:39:27.422 --> 00:39:30.164]  His family, us, you, the prosperity, all gone.
[00:39:30.604 --> 00:39:32.885]  He doesn't like wrecking a good, big, powerful country.
[00:39:32.905 --> 00:39:34.046]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:39:34.306 --> 00:39:36.227]  He doesn't need to piss on America to feel big.
[00:39:36.647 --> 00:39:39.329]  And he's sitting there with his foot bleeding and smashed.
[00:39:39.929 --> 00:39:40.369]  And guess what?
[00:39:40.429 --> 00:39:41.690]  My foot's shoved in the door too.
[00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.511]  And your foot's shoved in the door.
[00:39:44.151 --> 00:39:47.273]  With what you go through at work and church and life for standing up for what's right.
[00:39:47.293 --> 00:39:47.953]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:39:48.474 --> 00:39:50.255]  Everybody better stick their foot in the door
[00:39:51.502 --> 00:39:52.423]  And then do something else.
[00:39:52.463 --> 00:39:56.945]  Take your fingers and stick them in there and start pushing and pulling that door open.
[00:39:58.747 --> 00:39:59.847]  And that's what's starting to happen.
[00:40:02.829 --> 00:40:06.371]  Is that they want to smash those of us that already have our foot in the door, but guess what?
[00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:08.533]  More people's feet are going in the door right now.
[00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:12.895]  And the cavalry's coming up over the hill and the globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:14.716]  I said I'd get to all these clips I did in this segment.
[00:40:15.057 --> 00:40:18.439]  Next segment I'll get into all of her lying, all of her deception.
[00:40:20.238 --> 00:40:23.119]  And the rest of their official stories, the wheel's coming off.
[00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:30.142]  And I saw the talking points from Swallow's Well and Cory Booker and all the rest of them on the news this morning while I was working out.
[00:40:30.783 --> 00:40:42.147]  And the new talking point is, it doesn't matter, fine, investigate Kavanaugh, investigate Ford, investigate all of them, just now there's too big a cloud, just push it off or remove the nominee.
[00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:46.549]  Well, they vote him down on Friday because Mitch McConnell says that vote's coming.
[00:40:50.282 --> 00:40:52.824]  We're talking about re-nominating him again.
[00:40:53.905 --> 00:41:00.190]  That's what Lindsey Graham's talking about, and buying more time to let things unravel even more.
[00:41:02.371 --> 00:41:08.076]  We'll see what unfolds, but Graham seems to be committed to Kavanaugh and really angry about the bullying and stuff he's seen, so...
[00:41:09.744 --> 00:41:24.896]  His stock's gone way up in my mind, and a lot of experts have said, look, McCain rode herd on him, and kept his thumb on him, and that Graham could be like Darth Vader, you know, at the end he can throw the Emperor down the mine shaft, or down the reactor shaft, and that is certainly something we'd like to see.
[00:41:25.597 --> 00:41:29.480]  So, it's always, you know, not too late to join the good side.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.421]  We welcome everybody to come on over.
[00:41:32.382 --> 00:41:41.006]  And let's just bring back the family and bring back the right to religious freedom and the Second Amendment and private property and let's just be successful and kick ass together and let's move.
[00:41:41.267 --> 00:41:41.647]  Let's do it.
[00:41:42.587 --> 00:41:45.108]  And let's shut down all the racist crap and let's just come together.
[00:41:45.869 --> 00:41:47.129]  That's all Trump wants.
[00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:48.710]  That's what he tells everybody who works for him.
[00:41:50.471 --> 00:41:50.991]  Prosperity.
[00:41:51.031 --> 00:41:51.532]  Be strong.
[00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:51.972]  Have courage.
[00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:52.652]  Bring people together.
[00:41:53.473 --> 00:41:54.653]  Hire minorities.
[00:41:55.033 --> 00:41:55.494]  Build them up.
[00:41:58.855 --> 00:41:59.876]  Give your employees raises.
[00:42:02.534 --> 00:42:03.554]  That's gonna get the economy going?
[00:42:03.574 --> 00:42:05.575]  Get up off your ass, America.
[00:42:05.995 --> 00:42:08.575]  He's talking to the manager class and the owner class.
[00:42:09.536 --> 00:42:11.916]  We're gonna lose everything if we don't bet on this country now.
[00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:14.277]  People say, man, you've always been anti-government.
[00:42:14.297 --> 00:42:15.017]  Why are you 100% behind?
[00:42:15.257 --> 00:42:16.817]  Because we finally got our government back!
[00:42:17.037 --> 00:42:18.078]  Doesn't mean it's perfect!
[00:42:18.398 --> 00:42:19.478]  Doesn't mean it ain't gonna make mistakes!
[00:42:19.718 --> 00:42:20.678]  This is our government!
[00:42:21.178 --> 00:42:21.939]  It's our country!
[00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:23.699]  It's been a damn good country!
[00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:28.448]  So I'm going to fight.
[00:42:28.668 --> 00:42:29.329]  I'm going to go down.
[00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:32.250]  You know, they picked me as an example to be destroyed, to demoralize you.
[00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.371]  Do not get upset about the persecution.
[00:42:35.851 --> 00:42:36.231]  Back us.
[00:42:36.331 --> 00:42:36.851]  Pray for us.
[00:42:37.752 --> 00:42:39.492]  I want to make it through this, but it's God's plan.
[00:42:39.752 --> 00:42:41.153]  I feel good about whatever happens.
[00:42:41.473 --> 00:42:43.454]  Because we've already done some great things together.
[00:42:43.474 --> 00:42:45.594]  And I think we're going to do even greater things, but it doesn't matter.
[00:42:46.615 --> 00:42:50.756]  It's making that spiritual decision to get close to God that really matters in eternity.
[00:42:51.136 --> 00:42:54.818]  I'm going to get into Ford's testimony, and now it's been pouring to shreds, and we come right back.
[00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:55.258]  Stay with us.
[00:43:03.539 --> 00:43:12.550]  Florida elections are always competitive, and this is a guy who, although he's much too liberal for Florida, I think he's got huge problems with how he's governed Tallahassee.
[00:43:13.491 --> 00:43:18.157]  He is an articulate spokesman for those far-left views, and he's a charismatic candidate.
[00:43:18.738 --> 00:43:21.662]  I watched those Democrat debates, and none of that was my cup of tea.
[00:43:22.102 --> 00:43:24.464]  But I mean, he performed better than the other people there.
[00:43:24.544 --> 00:43:29.648]  So we've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction.
[00:43:29.668 --> 00:43:32.130]  Let's build off the success we've had on Governor Scott.
[00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:42.017]  The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state.
[00:43:42.098 --> 00:43:42.798]  Monkey this up?
[00:43:43.058 --> 00:43:43.679]  What does that mean to you?
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:59.271]  Well, I'll try to be articulate, Chris, and simply say that that kind of vitriol, and he's apparently given up the whistle, they've gone to the bullhorn with these kinds of tactics, but they're not going to work.
[00:44:00.312 --> 00:44:11.120]  We tried this one time, Donald Trump, this is a page from his playbook, basically tried to divide this country and my state, and I want them to know that Florida voters are smarter than that.
[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.882]  Uh, that we are going to reject the politics of separation.
[00:44:14.062 --> 00:44:18.646]  Will Johnson is kind of the undercover agent out on the West Coast.
[00:44:18.827 --> 00:44:20.068]  Very powerful indeed.
[00:44:20.308 --> 00:44:24.111]  Unite America First is where you can find a lot of his content.
[00:44:24.251 --> 00:44:25.853]  But, were you banned, Will?
[00:44:25.973 --> 00:44:28.275]  Or were you just put in timeout on Facebook?
[00:44:28.295 --> 00:44:29.576]  We'll get into why in a second.
[00:44:29.616 --> 00:44:31.197]  But what is your current status?
[00:44:31.317 --> 00:44:33.299]  I believe it's on Facebook where they're censoring you now?
[00:44:33.619 --> 00:44:39.525]  Yes, I've been banned for 30 days because I said black people are not monkeys.
[00:44:39.806 --> 00:44:47.874]  So it's bad if you say monkey even though you're not talking about black people, but then if you say black people are not monkeys, that's even worse and you get banned.
[00:44:48.863 --> 00:44:49.504]  Exactly.
[00:44:49.944 --> 00:44:50.284]  Exactly.
[00:44:50.304 --> 00:45:04.134]  And I was just making a point that the gentleman in Florida making a statement about monkeying around, the same statement Obama said, the same statement Chuck Schumer said, the same statement Dianne Feinstein said, but because he said it, he's a Republican, it's racist.
[00:45:04.355 --> 00:45:10.019]  Do they really believe he said that to signal to white people that, hey, this is a racist, anti-black candidate?
[00:45:10.039 --> 00:45:11.640]  Do you think they really believe that?
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.260]  No, they don't believe that.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:23.544]  They're just using this as a tactic to attack him, to attack any Republicans, to try to demonize them as racist white people trying to run for position in any political position across the nation.
[00:45:23.624 --> 00:45:28.945]  I mean, seriously, they are trying to, they pick anything and everything to try to demonize someone.
[00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:33.867]  And when they sent me the thing in Facebook banning me, they just said, you've been banned for this video.
[00:45:33.947 --> 00:45:37.688]  And they said, if you do anything like this again, we're going to permanently ban you.
[00:45:38.048 --> 00:45:40.729]  So my question is, is what is that, what statement
[00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:51.118]  Cause me to get banned because I said black people are not Monkeys or because I was talking about evolution where they say man came from monkeys Which one is it?
[00:45:51.138 --> 00:45:53.600]  You know, they always say that black people can't be racist.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.242]  So I said, okay, so can I call somebody a monkey?
[00:45:56.883 --> 00:46:00.506]  monkey You get the monkey pass
[00:46:04.993 --> 00:46:11.879]  Me as a black male, I'm giving you the monkey pass.
[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:14.882]  I can say, can I act like a monkey too?
[00:46:14.922 --> 00:46:15.262]  Can I go?
[00:46:19.368 --> 00:46:19.909]  No!
[00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:21.170]  Shut down InfoWars!
[00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:22.271]  Shut it down!
[00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:25.253]  They tell us we evolved from monkeys, right?
[00:46:25.293 --> 00:46:27.295]  They try to tell us we evolved from monkeys.
[00:46:27.355 --> 00:46:28.616]  Just totally right, Chris.
[00:46:28.876 --> 00:46:32.659]  But then they say if you say you're a monkey, you have to get banned and you're a racist.
[00:46:33.279 --> 00:46:34.280]  Exactly.
[00:46:34.981 --> 00:46:39.484]  I get so many attacks simply because I support the President and he's a white man.
[00:46:39.624 --> 00:46:40.945]  But he's the President of the United States.
[00:46:41.085 --> 00:46:42.026]  I voted for him.
[00:46:42.146 --> 00:46:43.327]  Most of us voted for him.
[00:46:43.407 --> 00:46:44.748]  We should not have to do that.
[00:46:44.828 --> 00:46:46.610]  And it's crazy that they're doing that to us.
[00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:47.991]  Monkey!
[00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:48.991]  Monkey?
[00:46:50.953 --> 00:46:52.154]  I'm a monkey!
[00:46:54.755 --> 00:46:55.196]  Monkey!
[00:47:04.222 --> 00:47:06.904]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.678 --> 00:47:25.805]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:26.527 --> 00:47:27.829]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:48.837 --> 00:47:49.959]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:49.979 --> 00:47:55.327]  I'm going to get into the meat and potatoes now of Blasey Ford and others.
[00:47:55.407 --> 00:47:56.889]  It's all just disintegrating.
[00:47:56.949 --> 00:47:59.052]  It always disintegrated.
[00:47:59.913 --> 00:48:01.215]  And then it's worse than we thought.
[00:48:01.255 --> 00:48:02.377]  She's a globetrotter.
[00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:04.832]  Costa Rica, New Zealand.
[00:48:05.813 --> 00:48:15.520]  She trains people, reportedly, as a psychologist, of course, that works in strange DARPA programs with her whole family and the CIA about how to get around lie detectors.
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.581]  Gee, wonder who trains people for that.
[00:48:18.141 --> 00:48:19.322]  And just all of it.
[00:48:19.482 --> 00:48:20.983]  It's ridiculous.
[00:48:22.124 --> 00:48:25.486]  But now they've moved on just saying, well, you can't have Kavanaugh, period.
[00:48:25.927 --> 00:48:26.887]  Will he get confirmed?
[00:48:26.927 --> 00:48:28.048]  It's on the razor's edge.
[00:48:28.429 --> 00:48:29.990]  Will it get pushed back past Friday?
[00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:31.411]  McConnell says no.
[00:48:34.068 --> 00:48:35.368]  Einstein thinks she can stop it.
[00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.649]  Disgraceful.
[00:48:36.669 --> 00:48:37.509]  Let's start going to the clips.
[00:48:38.009 --> 00:48:38.830]  Here's a flashback.
[00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:41.991]  Christine Ford is questioned about her fear of flying.
[00:48:42.271 --> 00:48:47.613]  And again, the articles are on Infowars.com of her traveling the world just recently.
[00:48:48.133 --> 00:48:51.794]  And her boyfriend, former boyfriend, said she was never afraid of flights.
[00:48:52.494 --> 00:48:56.056]  And I sat there and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test.
[00:48:56.096 --> 00:48:56.476]  Here it is.
[00:48:57.316 --> 00:48:59.757]  May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington?
[00:49:02.142 --> 00:49:03.143]  In an airplane.
[00:49:04.905 --> 00:49:13.055]  I ask that because it's been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying.
[00:49:13.075 --> 00:49:14.216]  Is that true?
[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:22.066]  Well, I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request.
[00:49:22.446 --> 00:49:24.248]  It would have been a quicker trip for me.
[00:49:24.268 --> 00:49:32.136]  That was certainly what I was hoping, was to avoid having to get on an airplane.
[00:49:33.456 --> 00:49:39.500]  I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane.
[00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:49.847]  When you were here in the mid-Atlantic area back in August, end of July, August, how did you get here?
[00:49:50.688 --> 00:49:51.688]  Also by airplane.
[00:49:51.909 --> 00:49:54.690]  I come here once a year during the summer to visit my family.
[00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.251]  I'm sorry, not here.
[00:49:56.312 --> 00:49:57.352]  I go to Delaware.
[00:50:00.579 --> 00:50:06.721]  In fact, you fly fairly frequently for your hobbies and you've had to fly for your work, is that true?
[00:50:07.121 --> 00:50:08.481]  Correct, unfortunately.
[00:50:09.682 --> 00:50:14.183]  You were a consulting biostatistician in Sydney, Australia, is that right?
[00:50:15.103 --> 00:50:21.804]  I've never been to Australia, but the company that I worked for is based in Australia and they have an office in San Francisco, California.
[00:50:22.705 --> 00:50:24.105]  I don't think I'll make it to Australia.
[00:50:25.962 --> 00:50:26.502]  It is long.
[00:50:27.522 --> 00:50:38.105]  I also saw on your CV that you list the following interests of surf travel and you in parentheses put Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific Islands, and French Polynesia.
[00:50:38.385 --> 00:50:39.745]  Have you been all to those places?
[00:50:40.285 --> 00:50:40.725]  Correct.
[00:50:41.465 --> 00:50:43.526]  By airplane?
[00:50:43.566 --> 00:50:44.546]  Yes.
[00:50:44.566 --> 00:50:51.088]  I fall asleep on three and four hour flights and Europe's okay, but let me tell you something.
[00:50:51.108 --> 00:50:53.068]  15 hour flights, I've done them, I dread them.
[00:50:55.393 --> 00:50:58.234]  It's because after like 10 hours, you're like, get me out of this damn thing.
[00:50:59.955 --> 00:51:01.056]  Starts getting claustrophobic.
[00:51:01.876 --> 00:51:03.137]  This woman loves it.
[00:51:03.237 --> 00:51:05.278]  Oh, but she couldn't fly the week before.
[00:51:05.398 --> 00:51:06.418]  She was afraid.
[00:51:06.778 --> 00:51:07.479]  I'm afraid.
[00:51:07.499 --> 00:51:08.799]  I'm a little baby.
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:18.544]  I work in implanted memories at a DARPA facility and do stuff for the defense language school and everything, but I, my whole family's in the CIA.
[00:51:18.644 --> 00:51:21.345]  I level, but I'm a sweet little lady.
[00:51:23.183 --> 00:51:25.204]  Baby, I can't come.
[00:51:25.684 --> 00:51:27.825]  You need to wait a few weeks and delay it.
[00:51:27.885 --> 00:51:29.266]  I'm scared.
[00:51:30.466 --> 00:51:31.687]  I'm scared now.
[00:51:31.867 --> 00:51:33.747]  I have PTSD.
[00:51:35.188 --> 00:51:35.868]  I'm scared.
[00:51:35.888 --> 00:51:36.869]  But look at the real face.
[00:51:36.889 --> 00:51:44.152]  Cause I saw she would go from like a little fake act to like... Like straw.
[00:51:44.212 --> 00:51:45.132]  The country's ours.
[00:51:45.252 --> 00:51:47.333]  Stop pushing.
[00:51:47.813 --> 00:51:49.654]  It's our control now.
[00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:55.932]  Can you put the meme back up of her, uh, next to, uh, next to Strock, please?
[00:51:56.912 --> 00:52:02.894]  When they're both making that face like... Kinda like Private Pyle in Full Metal Jacket.
[00:52:03.974 --> 00:52:16.577]  I am on a world, if you know what... Don't you... It's our country now!
[00:52:16.617 --> 00:52:17.438]  Get out of the way!
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:27.016]  The pleasure of being in power, and having control, and implanting memories, and hip
[00:52:32.745 --> 00:52:33.546]  Let's go back to the clip, sir.
[00:52:33.986 --> 00:52:35.646]  So, continuing.
[00:52:36.026 --> 00:52:36.526]  Here she is.
[00:52:36.746 --> 00:52:42.348]  Ford explains why she decided to take a polygraph test and now they've had the FBI guy on Fox.
[00:52:42.488 --> 00:52:43.128]  We've got the clip.
[00:52:44.008 --> 00:52:45.009]  He gave her two questions.
[00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:48.870]  You give someone 20 plus questions if it's a real one and still it's not conclusive.
[00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:52.871]  20 plus just to get their reading before you ask the real questions.
[00:52:53.111 --> 00:52:55.551]  A real polygraph has over a hundred questions.
[00:52:56.632 --> 00:52:57.312]  That's on average.
[00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:01.180]  But she got two.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.342]  Let's continue where she explains why she decided to take a polygraph.
[00:53:06.382 --> 00:53:11.785]  And now her ex-boyfriend says that he saw her helping train someone on how to pass one.
[00:53:11.825 --> 00:53:12.325]  Here it is.
[00:53:13.026 --> 00:53:21.270]  Based on the advice of the council, I was happy to undergo the polygraph test, although I found it extremely stressful.
[00:53:22.911 --> 00:53:24.552]  Much longer than I anticipated.
[00:53:25.999 --> 00:53:30.120]  I told my whole life story, I felt like, but I endured it.
[00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.921]  It was fine.
[00:53:32.001 --> 00:53:33.421]  I understand they can be that way.
[00:53:34.662 --> 00:53:37.963]  Have you ever taken any other polygraphs in your life?
[00:53:38.583 --> 00:53:38.903]  Never.
[00:53:40.704 --> 00:53:47.106]  You went to see a gentleman by the name of Jeremiah Hannafin to serve as the polygrapher.
[00:53:48.186 --> 00:53:50.027]  Did anyone advise you on that choice?
[00:53:54.582 --> 00:53:55.443]  Attorney Clyde Privilege.
[00:53:55.463 --> 00:53:58.266]  And she's got literally the Deep State top order.
[00:53:58.286 --> 00:53:59.668]  Yes, I believe his name was Jerry.
[00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:02.631]  Jerry Hannafin.
[00:54:02.811 --> 00:54:02.991]  Yeah.
[00:54:03.051 --> 00:54:03.872]  And he has two questions.
[00:54:03.892 --> 00:54:05.494]  Did anyone advise you on that choice?
[00:54:05.514 --> 00:54:10.500]  I don't understand the... By the way, that's not a polygraph test!
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.041]  Uh, person that came to do the polygraph test.
[00:54:15.081 --> 00:54:17.042]  That's your name, your parents, where you work, what you do?
[00:54:17.062 --> 00:54:24.344]  He actually conducted the polygraph not in his office in Virginia, but actually at the hotel next to Baltimore Washington Airport.
[00:54:24.384 --> 00:54:24.905]  Is that right?
[00:54:25.285 --> 00:54:25.745]  Correct.
[00:54:25.965 --> 00:54:28.566]  Why was that location chosen for the polygraph?
[00:54:29.858 --> 00:54:39.563]  I had left my grandmother's funeral at Fort Lincoln Cemetery that day and was on tight schedule to get a plane to Manchester, New Hampshire.
[00:54:39.944 --> 00:54:42.805]  So he was willing to come to me, which was appreciated.
[00:54:42.825 --> 00:54:51.290]  And then she goes on to say she's never known anything about polygraphs, doesn't even know what they are.
[00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.311]  It might have been the next day.
[00:54:52.331 --> 00:54:53.932]  I spent the night in the hotel.
[00:54:53.952 --> 00:54:57.734]  I don't remember the exact day.
[00:54:59.861 --> 00:55:01.663]  He's a literal mind control doctor.
[00:55:02.605 --> 00:55:11.716]  Have you ever had discussions with anyone besides your attorney on how to take a polygraph?
[00:55:13.058 --> 00:55:13.318]  Never.
[00:55:14.296 --> 00:55:17.158]  Oh no, she just knows about mind control, not about polygraphs!
[00:55:17.579 --> 00:55:21.222]  Just any sort of tips or anything like that.
[00:55:21.242 --> 00:55:21.862]  No, no.
[00:55:22.683 --> 00:55:26.546]  No, I was scared of the test itself.
[00:55:26.746 --> 00:55:28.007]  Oh, she's scared!
[00:55:28.027 --> 00:55:28.788]  Hit pause.
[00:55:29.128 --> 00:55:30.549]  She's like, I'm scared!
[00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.471]  I'm scared I can't fly!
[00:55:32.491 --> 00:55:34.172]  I can't in my little shell!
[00:55:34.432 --> 00:55:38.796]  But the reviews in college said she's the worst, she's vindictive, she's lazy, she's horrible.
[00:55:40.831 --> 00:55:43.333]  She's into group hypnosis, brainwashing.
[00:55:43.894 --> 00:55:46.095]  But she's a scared little girl!
[00:55:47.376 --> 00:55:49.338]  And she's... Go back that up ten seconds.
[00:55:49.358 --> 00:55:52.280]  Ryan Stelter says she's scared.
[00:55:52.501 --> 00:55:53.341]  Let's hear it again.
[00:55:55.303 --> 00:55:58.105]  Any sort of tips or anything like that?
[00:55:59.586 --> 00:56:03.450]  No, I was scared of the test itself.
[00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:08.073]  I was comfortable that I could tell the information.
[00:56:10.113 --> 00:56:12.494]  I mean, who do you think they're going to get to go up and say this?
[00:56:13.075 --> 00:56:17.037]  A mind control doctor hooked into DARPA, the whole family's in the CIA, I rest my case.
[00:56:17.277 --> 00:56:22.280]  We're going to go to break, come back and play some of the other clips, and then I'm going to get into all the other news and open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:25.921]  And I got Mitch McConnell saying we're not going to be intimidated, we're not going to back down.
[00:56:27.102 --> 00:56:32.585]  The Democrats pushing this far have finally gotten the bluebloods out of their damn coma, and this is a good day for America.
[00:56:32.865 --> 00:56:34.026]  I smell victory.
[00:56:34.326 --> 00:56:36.147]  The polls are way up in battleground states.
[00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:42.671]  But we won't be laughing when the Democrats with rogue troops set off a nuke and kill the President.
[00:56:42.691 --> 00:56:44.773]  I mean, let me tell you, they'll do anything.
[00:56:45.733 --> 00:56:48.555]  That said, you know, I've been forced to sue PayPal because it's market of the beast.
[00:56:48.595 --> 00:56:54.240]  They're buying up all the online companies and online wallets so you can't buy or sell like in China if you're not a good globalist.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.761]  So I'm doing this to inform the President.
[00:56:56.821 --> 00:57:00.664]  I'm going to air, really, our strategy to PayPal and all the other arrogant folks.
[00:57:03.206 --> 00:57:06.809]  I can't expect the President to take action if I don't take action.
[00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:14.594]  So, I told the White House, and I told the campaign, and I told national people that I'm gonna sue.
[00:57:16.155 --> 00:57:18.757]  And I'm sure you can figure that out why I'm doing that.
[00:57:19.317 --> 00:57:21.159]  It's now a national story, dumbasses.
[00:57:21.999 --> 00:57:22.400]  And now...
[00:57:23.405 --> 00:57:29.230]  The president will prepare action against persecution against conservatives and Christians by banking institutions.
[00:57:30.291 --> 00:57:32.413]  You think you're playing games with somebody here?
[00:57:33.054 --> 00:57:33.514]  Fools?
[00:57:34.395 --> 00:57:35.096]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:35.216 --> 00:57:37.097]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:57:37.298 --> 00:57:39.219]  We need funding though to continue the war.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.320]  We got big specials.
[00:57:40.521 --> 00:57:42.763]  So get an InfoWars store right now if you want to see us win.
[00:57:50.157 --> 00:57:55.198]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[00:57:55.338 --> 00:58:03.620]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver, that is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[00:58:03.700 --> 00:58:12.441]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first-aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and secondary burns, skin irritations.
[00:58:12.641 --> 00:58:14.882]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[00:58:15.002 --> 00:58:16.942]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[00:58:17.502 --> 00:58:18.964]  It's just incredible.
[00:58:19.044 --> 00:58:19.945]  It's $29.95 out of the gate.
[00:58:20.025 --> 00:58:21.206]  This is next level.
[00:58:21.266 --> 00:58:22.828]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[00:58:23.348 --> 00:58:27.493]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[00:58:27.833 --> 00:58:32.258]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[00:58:32.378 --> 00:58:35.841]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[00:58:35.981 --> 00:58:37.243]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[00:58:37.403 --> 00:58:40.246]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[00:58:40.586 --> 00:58:49.268]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals, and he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[00:58:49.509 --> 00:58:54.110]  Inforestore.com, Inforestlife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:58:54.210 --> 00:59:01.472]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[00:59:01.992 --> 00:59:06.254]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[00:59:06.634 --> 00:59:07.134]  This is it.
[00:59:07.394 --> 00:59:09.815]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[00:59:09.915 --> 00:59:11.596]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[00:59:11.796 --> 00:59:12.356]  Nanotech.
[00:59:12.536 --> 00:59:15.017]  Super small particles which go in electromagnetically.
[00:59:15.037 --> 00:59:16.358]  It just goes right into the heart of something.
[00:59:18.017 --> 00:59:28.028]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel contains the powerful Silver Sol technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver market.
[00:59:28.208 --> 00:59:39.020]  As the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind, this gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.341]  Speed up the healing process, and that's the way I like it.
[00:59:43.401 --> 00:59:49.503]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now at InFourWarsLife.com.
[00:59:52.324 --> 00:59:58.226]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.874 --> 01:00:22.074]  That sun is high.
[01:00:22.114 --> 01:00:32.937]  You know, I'm proud to see Texas in the fight against globalists.
[01:00:44.321 --> 01:00:50.544]  I'm glad that Infowars operations against the New World Order are seen as the most deadly weapon other than Trump in the fight.
[01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.405]  I'm proud of Texas.
[01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:53.946]  Yet again, the spirit rising.
[01:00:54.306 --> 01:00:56.807]  But California collapsing is trying to seize our state.
[01:00:57.308 --> 01:01:11.315]  Every news channel, even local conservative radio, puts down Senator Cruz, worships that hit-and-run, drunk-driving, anti-gun, pervert, pedo-bedo, or Beto, whatever his name is.
[01:01:11.855 --> 01:01:13.616]  We'll be talking about that more coming up late.
[01:01:14.727 --> 01:01:16.468]  I'll be looking for 8 when they pull that gate.
[01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:21.011]  And I'm here to tell you, we've got the poll numbers I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:01:21.031 --> 01:01:22.992]  6, 7, 8 to 15 to 20.
[01:01:23.092 --> 01:01:32.638]  On average about 12 points gains by Republicans in battleground states since this whole Kavanaugh fiasco.
[01:01:33.379 --> 01:01:38.422]  Now I was getting to know the wheels are coming off of this, and this woman's this global, global trotter.
[01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:41.104]  I mean, she's all over the world.
[01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:42.666]  I don't think so.
[01:02:02.256 --> 01:02:03.897]  She's going through a lot right now.
[01:02:03.937 --> 01:02:05.698]  There's something wrong with her, my friend.
[01:02:06.358 --> 01:02:08.159]  And so she just told me to talk to her lawyer.
[01:02:08.199 --> 01:02:09.880]  But yeah, the lawyer said it didn't happen, lady.
[01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:13.922]  But the media keeps going with, you've got all these witnesses in your own testimony.
[01:02:14.143 --> 01:02:15.583]  You kept saying you had all these witnesses.
[01:02:15.864 --> 01:02:16.944]  Lying again!
[01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:18.885]  God!
[01:02:19.586 --> 01:02:22.827]  Oh, but even the New York Times can't even say, oh, is she credible?
[01:02:22.847 --> 01:02:23.728]  Oh, we're so sorry!
[01:02:24.228 --> 01:02:25.449]  You can't ask if she's credible.
[01:02:25.549 --> 01:02:30.512]  I mean, she's a bug-eyed, Hillary-supporting, man-hating,
[01:02:33.272 --> 01:02:34.293]  Spook, in my view.
[01:02:35.414 --> 01:02:36.635]  Hell, we know her whole family is.
[01:02:37.776 --> 01:02:41.058]  And she's the nasty academic type that perches on top of the country.
[01:02:41.399 --> 01:02:44.641]  Not the spooks that actually do the killing and the fighting all over the world.
[01:02:45.362 --> 01:02:45.862]  No, no, no.
[01:02:45.922 --> 01:02:50.966]  She's the little wimp version that perches up there on top of all of us like Reality Winner.
[01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:52.887]  She should be Reality Winner's mommy!
[01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:56.750]  Well, guess what, bloodsuckers?
[01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:57.291]  We're awake!
[01:02:58.507 --> 01:03:04.470]  Listen to this sickening exchange where she throws her friend under the bus for saying she's not telling the truth.
[01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.890]  Here it is.
[01:03:05.451 --> 01:03:12.294]  When you did leave that night, did Leland Kaiser, now Kaiser, ever follow up with you and say, hey, what happened to you?
[01:03:14.715 --> 01:03:16.856]  I've had communications with her recently.
[01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:20.518]  I'm talking about like the next day.
[01:03:20.738 --> 01:03:21.218]  Oh, no.
[01:03:21.438 --> 01:03:22.699]  She didn't know about the event.
[01:03:22.959 --> 01:03:26.101]  She was downstairs during the event and I did not share it with her.
[01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:37.791]  Are you aware that the three people at the party besides yourself and Brett Kavanaugh have given statements under penalty of felony to the committee?
[01:03:38.692 --> 01:03:38.952]  Yes.
[01:03:39.272 --> 01:03:41.013]  And are you aware of what those statements say?
[01:03:41.253 --> 01:03:42.454]  Yes.
[01:03:42.574 --> 01:03:48.097]  Are you aware that they say that they have no memory or knowledge of such a party?
[01:03:48.798 --> 01:03:49.038]  Yes.
[01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:54.621]  Do you have any particular motives to ascribe to Leland?
[01:03:56.642 --> 01:03:58.803]  I guess we could take those one at a time.
[01:04:01.324 --> 01:04:11.547]  Leland has significant health challenges and I'm happy that she's focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs.
[01:04:11.927 --> 01:04:16.629]  And she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her.
[01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:23.431]  And she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes and etc.
[01:04:23.571 --> 01:04:25.412]  So I'm glad that she's taking care of herself.
[01:04:27.506 --> 01:04:29.146]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:32.487]  We're going to come back on the other side of this quick break and continue looking at this.
[01:04:32.547 --> 01:04:41.048]  And then, Owen Benjamin, a well-known comedian and actor, is going to weigh in on this and tell some of his own life stories here on air.
[01:04:41.488 --> 01:04:43.109]  And I don't want anybody to question it.
[01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:47.330]  And look, you know, he's smiling and laughing about it, but it's because he's under stress.
[01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:48.370]  Okay?
[01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:49.870]  He's got a lot of courage.
[01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:55.551]  What Matt Damon did to him, I'm not even going to question what Matt Damon did to him,
[01:04:56.963 --> 01:04:59.550]  Because, you know, Benjamin's a little guy and Damon held him down.
[01:05:00.833 --> 01:05:04.743]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:05:06.098 --> 01:05:14.241]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:05:14.761 --> 01:05:16.042]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:05:16.762 --> 01:05:19.563]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:05:20.203 --> 01:05:22.184]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:05:22.824 --> 01:05:24.465]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:05:25.105 --> 01:05:32.048]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:05:32.628 --> 01:05:42.353]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:05:42.393 --> 01:05:42.793]  We'll win.
[01:05:43.594 --> 01:05:45.895]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:05:46.415 --> 01:05:53.199]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:05:53.639 --> 01:05:57.021]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[01:05:57.341 --> 01:05:58.542]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour.
[01:05:58.562 --> 01:05:59.562]  We need your support.
[01:05:59.763 --> 01:06:00.303]  I'm counting on you.
[01:06:04.884 --> 01:06:08.927]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:15.472]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:22.998 --> 01:06:31.544]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:36.448 --> 01:06:55.798]  We are about to air the video proof that Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, and the DNC are behind the move to ban InfoWars and then every other major conservative, or libertarian, or nationalist, or Christian, or pro-gun, or veteran group off the internet.
[01:06:56.418 --> 01:07:05.943]  It's in the WikiLeaks from three years ago, but it's in her statements going back a year and a half ago, right through last month, where she brags how they defined InfoWars
[01:07:06.383 --> 01:07:11.045]  It's fake news and Russian propaganda to make America great again.
[01:07:11.225 --> 01:07:18.588]  And how she got Big Tech to then, ahead of the midterms, only 30-something days out, to ban us.
[01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:31.554]  This is an admission of racketeering, an admission of antitrust, an admission of civil rights violations, an admission of Big Tech corporate Democrat-run mafia.
[01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:37.781]  Crushing InfoWars and your ability to comment on our articles and our videos.
[01:07:39.042 --> 01:07:40.663]  We're going to air this piece right now.
[01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:42.545]  This is so incredibly important.
[01:07:42.605 --> 01:07:48.869]  This is a big deal because if they can shut down InfoWars, they can shut everybody down and that's their plan.
[01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:51.812]  Demonize us, get people to abandon us.
[01:07:52.904 --> 01:07:55.565]  So the next person they attack, nobody stands up as well.
[01:07:56.285 --> 01:07:58.106]  They believe they're breaking your will right now.
[01:07:58.786 --> 01:08:01.047]  I believe they're waking you up.
[01:08:01.827 --> 01:08:03.647]  This is what the witch had to say herself.
[01:08:04.107 --> 01:08:05.668]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[01:08:06.048 --> 01:08:12.190]  And I tell you all of it, I could literally keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable.
[01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.451]  This is coming to a theater near you.
[01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:28.380]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year.
[01:08:29.441 --> 01:08:34.644]  It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
[01:08:34.884 --> 01:08:40.188]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel people I've talked to,
[01:08:41.088 --> 01:08:46.693]  Could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[01:08:47.434 --> 01:08:48.735]  Guided by Americans.
[01:08:48.935 --> 01:08:49.956]  Guided by Americans.
[01:08:50.537 --> 01:08:58.604]  And so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds.
[01:08:58.944 --> 01:08:59.825]  What does it mean?
[01:09:00.366 --> 01:09:03.548]  It's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly.
[01:09:04.489 --> 01:09:16.200]  Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news.
[01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:26.530]  There have been a series of studies, academic studies, since the election trying to figure out why people voted the way they did because it defied all the polls.
[01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:28.432]  Nobody was ready for it.
[01:09:29.132 --> 01:09:37.655]  And people relied on what they saw in the media, but even more so online.
[01:09:37.955 --> 01:09:48.318]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:09:48.778 --> 01:09:51.039]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.820]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[01:09:54.810 --> 01:09:56.250]  Your reputation's amazing.
[01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:58.111]  I will not let you down.
[01:09:58.211 --> 01:10:01.112]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:10:01.152 --> 01:10:07.374]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[01:10:07.394 --> 01:10:19.217]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[01:10:19.397 --> 01:10:25.304]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[01:10:25.504 --> 01:10:29.409]  Social media giants acting this time before it's too late.
[01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:30.430]  Their goal?
[01:10:30.771 --> 01:10:34.595]  To prevent fake news and propaganda from influencing the upcoming U.S.
[01:10:34.616 --> 01:10:35.537]  midterm election.
[01:10:35.717 --> 01:10:38.480]  I'm glad that the Congress and others are looking
[01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:49.709]  At Facebook and Twitter and Google because they are the vehicles, one of the very first vehicles to deliver this kind of information to people.
[01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:51.731]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[01:10:52.391 --> 01:10:57.475]  And they began to have some of their allies within the
[01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:08.283]  Internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and begin to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:11:08.544 --> 01:11:16.209]  If something popped up in a Facebook feed and looked like a news report, people were inclined to believe it.
[01:11:16.570 --> 01:11:27.598]  And if they were already targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided, they were influenceable.
[01:11:27.978 --> 01:11:30.500]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.801]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[01:11:34.042 --> 01:11:43.367]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:53.453]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[01:12:04.182 --> 01:12:15.433]  Now, I'm going to air a video of Owen Benjamin breaking down what he says happened to him at the hands of Matt Damon.
[01:12:16.454 --> 01:12:18.355]  Now, I did an intro video last night.
[01:12:19.056 --> 01:12:19.917]  That's not the one I want to air.
[01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:26.173]  I want to air the one specifically with just what he said so people can see this for themselves.
[01:12:26.833 --> 01:12:28.614]  We're going to be talking to Owen Benjamin here.
[01:12:30.876 --> 01:12:33.137]  So, again, let's go ahead and go to that clip.
[01:12:34.578 --> 01:12:43.044]  I'm finally ready because of the courage of Christine Blasey Ford to come forward in such a terrible time to tell my story.
[01:12:44.184 --> 01:12:47.006]  And I need to be believed.
[01:12:48.747 --> 01:12:49.388]  I was raped.
[01:12:50.643 --> 01:12:51.923]  By Matt Damon.
[01:12:53.264 --> 01:13:02.545]  I don't remember exactly what year, but it was right around when Good Will Hunting came out, and there was no Good Will when he hunted me and raped me.
[01:13:04.206 --> 01:13:05.686]  Amy, do you remember me telling you that?
[01:13:08.107 --> 01:13:08.947]  Yeah, totally.
[01:13:09.947 --> 01:13:10.367]  You remember?
[01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:10.467]  Yeah.
[01:13:13.248 --> 01:13:13.708]  Oh, look.
[01:13:14.568 --> 01:13:14.968]  A woman.
[01:13:16.148 --> 01:13:16.828]  She remembers.
[01:13:17.529 --> 01:13:19.009]  Do you remember that I said he raped me?
[01:13:20.586 --> 01:13:21.146]  Yeah, totally.
[01:13:24.248 --> 01:13:26.789]  Matt Damon, it's time for the reckoning.
[01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:32.132]  You raped me and now I'm gonna... I want 750 grand.
[01:13:32.152 --> 01:13:42.278]  Article, Matt Damon accused of rape, and then it goes on to point out that this is him illustrating what's going on with absurdity.
[01:13:42.298 --> 01:13:45.480]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.141]  He does hang out with his best buddies.
[01:13:48.126 --> 01:13:52.447]  With a known serial rapist and assaulter, Harvey Weinstein.
[01:13:52.467 --> 01:13:59.349]  So it has more credibility, as has his associations and as Hollywood, than it does to say this about Kavanaugh.
[01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:05.751]  But, you were going to be here in studio today, but I heard that Matt Damon sabotaged your flight.
[01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:09.012]  There's no need for due process or proof, is there Owen Benjamin?
[01:14:09.572 --> 01:14:17.575]  Just because you are accusing a man of something, because Matt Damon is a man, we've got to go ahead and, I guess he should ever work again, right?
[01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:27.237]  Yeah, I mean, I was always very skeptical of the Me Too movement because I thought it was a pound symbol, so I thought it was pound me too, which is very confusing.
[01:14:27.977 --> 01:14:37.704]  But when I saw Matt Damon on Saturday Night Live mocking an innocent man, the voice, his voice triggered something in me and I remember him raping me.
[01:14:37.764 --> 01:14:39.626]  I don't know the time or the place.
[01:14:40.947 --> 01:14:44.950]  I remember when he was finished, he said, how do you like them apples?
[01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.872]  And that's when I started to weep.
[01:14:48.735 --> 01:14:55.417]  And I guess that's all the information you really need these days to get, you know, $750,000.
[01:14:55.457 --> 01:15:03.859]  And as you saw, my wife, who's half-minority, she's half-Hispanic, so that gives her even more credibility.
[01:15:03.899 --> 01:15:11.481]  She's a woman and also half-not-white, so I think it's a crime to not believe that she's telling the truth that I did tell her.
[01:15:11.501 --> 01:15:14.661]  Well, that's what Maisie, the senator in Hawaii, said.
[01:15:14.701 --> 01:15:16.742]  She said, men just sit down and shut up.
[01:15:17.734 --> 01:15:28.780]  Yeah, but it's time for me to stand up and tell my story that Matt Damon, Academy Award winning Matt Damon, gave me the hard R. And he never apologized and he never looked sad.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:30.560]  He's a big guy, you're a little guy.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:34.642]  Yeah, I'm 6'7", and he's about 5'9", but in my mind he was about 9'8".
[01:15:42.615 --> 01:15:44.476]  And, uh, and that's credible.
[01:15:44.717 --> 01:15:45.977]  Well, I appreciate your courage.
[01:15:46.017 --> 01:15:47.779]  Let's talk about what he did to you.
[01:15:48.859 --> 01:15:51.461]  When he... We know how you rape a guy.
[01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:52.602]  Oh, this is terrible.
[01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:54.723]  He got a lot of courage right now.
[01:15:54.963 --> 01:16:00.087]  Matt Damon's got a lot of explaining to do.
[01:16:00.207 --> 01:16:01.208]  Wow.
[01:16:01.228 --> 01:16:03.309]  33% of the population of the U.S.
[01:16:03.549 --> 01:16:06.191]  That's 2 out of every 3 people you're looking at.
[01:16:06.974 --> 01:16:10.436]  carry staph aureus bacteria in their nose.
[01:16:11.117 --> 01:16:17.060]  Two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin-resistant staph.
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:23.344]  Now what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than AIDS.
[01:16:23.784 --> 01:16:32.149]  And so what we do is we work really hard, did massive amounts of research, and we found that our gel, your gel,
[01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:35.471]  As a first line of defense, it's amazing.
[01:16:35.551 --> 01:16:43.878]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that will last up to three days.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:51.202]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph, E. coli, Candida, Aspergillus niger, in minutes.
[01:16:52.022 --> 01:17:08.628]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field and ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a methicillin-resistant staph bacteria, from that soccer field.
[01:17:09.348 --> 01:17:17.470]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephones, in subways.
[01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:28.411]  And this gel that you have access to is the first line of defense for everybody to be able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria.
[01:17:28.732 --> 01:17:36.553]  You gel it up and you don't worry about it because we have heal rates of about half the normal time and you actually have something now
[01:17:37.526 --> 01:17:40.809]  In your house, where you can easily take care of it.
[01:17:40.829 --> 01:17:54.099]  I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time, because explain why the super silver wound gel dressing from Infowarslife.com that we probably labeled from your top of the line, your top selling product nationwide, why is it so special?
[01:17:54.599 --> 01:18:03.326]  These studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes down 24 hours with no negative effect on any system in your body.
[01:18:03.747 --> 01:18:06.469]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[01:18:07.276 --> 01:18:08.217]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:18:08.237 --> 01:18:16.905]  Over-the-counter, which is what you have, available to your people, is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[01:18:17.145 --> 01:18:19.927]  You have one of the only products in the U.S.
[01:18:19.967 --> 01:18:23.991]  that can, like, make a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[01:18:24.411 --> 01:18:30.297]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about, probably, three or four minutes.
[01:18:30.937 --> 01:18:33.740]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:37.864]  What a blessing to have something that you have in your house right now.
[01:18:38.024 --> 01:18:40.306]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this.
[01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:53.059]  So hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were caused in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[01:18:53.759 --> 01:18:59.224]  That's why they're going back to the silver products, because our silver is proven to kill, though.
[01:18:59.784 --> 01:19:06.129]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are Methicillin-resistant Staph and one called VRE.
[01:19:06.289 --> 01:19:10.853]  And VRE is Ventomycin-resistant Enterococcus Fecalis.
[01:19:11.093 --> 01:19:13.495]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[01:19:14.075 --> 01:19:16.938]  And so the cool part is, this gel kills it in a minute.
[01:19:17.678 --> 01:19:27.121]  So you don't have to worry about your kid getting an amputation or wound or you don't have to have, you know, a funeral for somebody you lost.
[01:19:27.141 --> 01:19:32.283]  And the bottom line is you guys did years and years and years and years and years and years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies.
[01:19:32.583 --> 01:19:41.546]  You finally found out the perfect silver, the most effective, and it's available at Infowarsstore.com and you helped save the country and defeat the globalists.
[01:19:41.646 --> 01:19:41.846]  A 360 win.
[01:19:41.926 --> 01:19:43.247]  Everybody needs this in their arsenal.
[01:19:43.647 --> 01:19:48.649]  I have stockpiled it because the number one thing threatening us is automobile accidents and flesh-eating bacteria, folks.
[01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.130]  And you need to get this product.
[01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:51.771]  Everybody needs this for their children.
[01:19:52.131 --> 01:19:53.372]  Everybody needs this for themselves.
[01:19:53.812 --> 01:19:59.194]  Super Silver Loon Dressing Gel at Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com.
[01:20:03.677 --> 01:20:06.278]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:21.741]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.596]  All right, I love having Owen Benjamin on the show.
[01:20:55.616 --> 01:20:57.557]  One of the most censored comedians out there.
[01:20:57.577 --> 01:20:58.978]  He's been popping on a lot, listeners love him.
[01:20:59.758 --> 01:21:03.360]  And he's been watching this whole Kavanaugh fiasco.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:07.982]  Everything Ford says, everything these other women say, none of the witnesses say it happened.
[01:21:09.683 --> 01:21:11.264]  And then Ford says, well, she's sick.
[01:21:13.376 --> 01:21:14.617]  And it's just otherworldly.
[01:21:14.637 --> 01:21:19.139]  And then she's involved in a weird DARPA program to implant memories in people.
[01:21:19.179 --> 01:21:25.061]  And then she's a globetrotter, bragging how she's, you know, in Tahiti or whatever and everywhere else, Costa Rica.
[01:21:25.562 --> 01:21:27.483]  And then she says, but I'm afraid to fly.
[01:21:27.503 --> 01:21:30.964]  And I was afraid of the polygraph.
[01:21:31.344 --> 01:21:34.046]  And they only gave her two questions, which is not a polygraph.
[01:21:34.066 --> 01:21:36.787]  Maybe like 20, 30, 40 questions just to warm you up.
[01:21:37.711 --> 01:21:42.954]  But getting serious here, because it's obviously satire and you're illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[01:21:43.314 --> 01:21:47.416]  We even said it was a joke in the article, you know, in one paragraph before the video.
[01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:50.817]  People are like, oh, how dare you say this for clickbait?
[01:21:50.998 --> 01:21:52.198]  We're not doing that.
[01:21:52.818 --> 01:21:53.839]  We're putting it out.
[01:21:54.359 --> 01:21:55.220]  So let's explain.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.742]  I mean, Matt Damon really didn't rape you unless you went and I guess went to
[01:22:00.902 --> 01:22:10.727]  To this Christine Blasey Ford's class, and then she did hypnosis on you, and then I guess maybe if you believe that Matt Damon raped you, maybe it's true.
[01:22:11.847 --> 01:22:19.051]  Point we're obviously trying to make, there's more evidence that Matt Damon raped me, because there isn't five people saying that he didn't.
[01:22:20.772 --> 01:22:27.155]  Like, if we go by the leftist standard of rape accusation equals destroy an honorable man's life,
[01:22:27.916 --> 01:22:32.701]  Matt Damon is far more guilty than Judge Kavanaugh of raping me.
[01:22:32.721 --> 01:22:38.968]  Because I was going to fly down to the studio today, as you know, and I sat on a tarmac today because the plane broke for six hours.
[01:22:39.609 --> 01:22:44.214]  And allegedly, Matt Damon broke the plane because he didn't want the secret out.
[01:22:44.254 --> 01:22:46.596]  Like, there's a couple people being like, no way, it's Matt Damon.
[01:22:46.977 --> 01:22:48.859]  And I'm like, oh, that is my rapist.
[01:22:49.474 --> 01:22:51.595]  See, anyone can just make this stuff up.
[01:22:52.756 --> 01:22:53.696]  It's ridiculous.
[01:22:54.157 --> 01:22:56.978]  And we need due process because you can't prove a negative.
[01:22:57.298 --> 01:23:00.980]  I know you've had this, Alex, and I know I've had this when you're accused of something.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.181]  You can't prove you're not something.
[01:23:03.281 --> 01:23:04.022]  It's illogic.
[01:23:04.722 --> 01:23:07.924]  Inverse, that makes it so someone can just have control over you.
[01:23:07.944 --> 01:23:20.372]  So that's why, instead of just in a constant state of backpedal, I now am just doing the same thing to them, except in a way that's obviously satire, because I don't want to bear false actual witness.
[01:23:20.512 --> 01:23:22.974]  You're not actually trying to destroy their lives, but you're lucky.
[01:23:23.014 --> 01:23:23.234]  Exactly.
[01:23:23.254 --> 01:23:24.895]  The word is Matt Damon is a gremlin.
[01:23:25.195 --> 01:23:29.438]  He could take on that form, got into the belly of the plane, ripped up some of the avionics and things.
[01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:32.300]  Could have been worse, he could have been on the wing of the plane.
[01:23:33.127 --> 01:23:40.772]  Well, Damon wanted me to survive, though, because he doesn't want to kill his victims, because he likes to know that I get triggered every time I hear, how do you like them apples?
[01:23:40.832 --> 01:23:45.675]  Or even if I use an apple product, I think about goodwill hunting and, of course, the vicious rape.
[01:23:46.075 --> 01:23:49.558]  So it would have been a mercy kill if he did take down the plane, and he knows that.
[01:23:49.578 --> 01:23:50.098]  Well, you're 6'7".
[01:23:50.838 --> 01:23:57.563]  How is Matt Damon in this dream, this false memory you had implanted, I guess at Stanford?
[01:23:58.456 --> 01:24:03.720]  He's part elephant, and he has little... and Ben Affleck was there laughing.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.621]  All I remember is the laughter, Alex.
[01:24:05.661 --> 01:24:06.842]  I don't remember where it was.
[01:24:07.283 --> 01:24:10.145]  I just remember that there were stares and laughter.
[01:24:10.905 --> 01:24:12.006]  And for that, I want $750,000.
[01:24:12.907 --> 01:24:16.369]  And any of my other enemies want to talk smack?
[01:24:16.809 --> 01:24:17.370]  Well, guess what?
[01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:18.651]  You were there too, raping away.
[01:24:19.151 --> 01:24:21.353]  And I want more money, and I want you fired too.
[01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:26.587]  Well, she'd raised $750,000 as of the day she testified.
[01:24:26.647 --> 01:24:27.408]  What is it now?
[01:24:27.428 --> 01:24:28.928]  I heard it was over a million.
[01:24:29.848 --> 01:24:30.229]  I'm sure.
[01:24:30.309 --> 01:24:37.491]  And her ex-boyfriend just came out, I'm sure you saw this, where they used to always be on prop planes.
[01:24:37.991 --> 01:24:43.893]  He witnessed her, and he swore this, he just swore this with fear of perjury that
[01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:50.437]  That he witnessed her coaching another woman how to take a lie detector test, and she got him for bank fraud.
[01:24:50.898 --> 01:24:55.863]  This news just came out, like, late, late last night, and the mainstream media won't report it.
[01:24:56.283 --> 01:24:57.725]  Like, she's a proven liar.
[01:24:57.965 --> 01:24:59.347]  And that she's not afraid to fly.
[01:24:59.387 --> 01:25:06.134]  And it's not only we just have to believe him, we have the witnesses of her own saying she's a globetrotter, loves to fly, flies to places 16 hours away.
[01:25:08.035 --> 01:25:26.126]  Well, yeah, and as you know, the leftists use our own morality and our own sense of honor against us, and I'm on to them at this point, and I know you are as well, that they will just use our deference to actual victims that really do need to be heard, like the victims of Harvey Weinstein, for example.
[01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:33.835]  And they'll use that to put us in a state of fear and a state of immobility, and that is when they just acquire power.
[01:25:33.855 --> 01:25:36.056]  And if they get total power, we're in gulags.
[01:25:36.676 --> 01:25:39.798]  And that's why my role is to fight it with satire.
[01:25:39.838 --> 01:25:43.220]  Like, I'll do these It's Time videos and jokes and stuff like that.
[01:25:43.701 --> 01:25:46.262]  And that's good at waking people up to the absurdity of it.
[01:25:47.963 --> 01:25:49.884]  But, you know, everyone has their role to play.
[01:25:49.904 --> 01:25:55.668]  But at this point, more Americans need to shoulder the burden of fighting the leftist, globalist,
[01:25:56.326 --> 01:26:05.338]  Nonsense is truth, everything is power, this Machiavellian nightmare that's happening, because it's easy to beat if you just say what you believe.
[01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:10.245]  Let me ask you this question, because we're going to go to break, come back and play Mitch McConnell saying they won't be bullied some other clubs.
[01:26:11.186 --> 01:26:36.281]  The whole show, and I'm going to get to it when we come back, that major shifts in battleground states for Republicans, for Trump now, this somehow just the witch hunt went too far and all the witnesses saying it didn't happen and her remembering not the house or the year or whatever but she had a beer and what they were wearing in the room and but she didn't tell anybody and then none of the friends say it's true and then she's a globetrotter but lied about that and then her whole family's CIA leftist kook balls.
[01:26:36.701 --> 01:26:40.203]  I mean, I really think they have gone too far here.
[01:26:41.198 --> 01:26:43.141]  Yeah, they've woken up a lot of people.
[01:26:43.161 --> 01:26:51.332]  Like, I've had just this week a few people that are more higher up in LA that haven't talked to me in a while, like, text me how I'm doing and stuff.
[01:26:51.733 --> 01:26:56.279]  Because I think they finally saw that appeasement just means you get eaten last.
[01:26:57.063 --> 01:27:05.029]  And it's a lot harder to dismiss Kavanaugh, like this centrist, Eagle Scout, you know, Yale guy.
[01:27:05.409 --> 01:27:08.911]  Like, the left was trying to prove that they can do it to anybody at any time.
[01:27:09.011 --> 01:27:13.154]  Even Mike Pence, who never is alone with a woman, they could do this.
[01:27:13.194 --> 01:27:14.975]  They could say, well, a ghost was touched.
[01:27:15.536 --> 01:27:20.879]  Like, they're trying to do a power display where no one's safe, and that caused a chill.
[01:27:21.139 --> 01:27:22.180]  There's going to be a red wave, 100%.
[01:27:24.116 --> 01:27:24.857]  There's no way.
[01:27:25.077 --> 01:27:31.564]  People that I know that never would vote and think I'm crazy are like, dude, we can't let the Democrats take over the House.
[01:27:31.604 --> 01:27:32.485]  These people are insane.
[01:27:32.766 --> 01:27:35.008]  They've weaponized rape accusations!
[01:27:35.468 --> 01:27:36.870]  Like, that's a sacred thing!
[01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:38.392]  Like, rape is horrible!
[01:27:38.948 --> 01:27:42.250]  And it's like, you can't do this to men, because men are naturally protective.
[01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:51.675]  So, we're going to believe women a lot of times, and then when you see the obvious, you know, Feinstein, this archaic war leech.
[01:27:52.196 --> 01:27:57.679]  Like, when you see someone like that and their real motives, it makes you just... Well, that's it, is they are raping the truth.
[01:27:57.759 --> 01:28:02.902]  And you have this coach saying, our team got raped by the refs, and he gets suspended or fired.
[01:28:03.262 --> 01:28:05.083]  Where now, they're even raping language.
[01:28:06.135 --> 01:28:08.317]  Oh, well the rape of the language is how the left does it.
[01:28:09.198 --> 01:28:14.544]  I'm starting to realize the reason that they actually banned To Kill a Mockingbird, my mom teaches literature.
[01:28:15.274 --> 01:28:23.258]  It's not actually the n-word, which the real n-word is no, by the way, but it's because it shows due process.
[01:28:23.339 --> 01:28:27.221]  It shows what the story of To Kill a Mockingbird shows what happens.
[01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:27.401]  Exactly.
[01:28:27.421 --> 01:28:30.623]  The left, stay there when we come back, we'll talk about this, they're at war with due process.
[01:28:31.303 --> 01:28:32.784]  Yeah, oh yeah, because they need power.
[01:28:33.364 --> 01:28:40.628]  And actually the professor said while the left wanted to sit back, he's a nice white guy trying to be a good guy, which is what abolition and all that was.
[01:28:41.028 --> 01:28:41.809]  Well, you can't have.
[01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:47.496]  Gregory Peck, who was a liberal by the way, a classical liberal, you can't have a white guy in a good role.
[01:28:48.257 --> 01:28:52.522]  That is the new hyper-racist garbage of the weird white professor saying that.
[01:28:52.782 --> 01:28:54.284]  It's not minorities saying that.
[01:28:54.665 --> 01:28:55.346]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:08.008]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[01:29:57.131 --> 01:29:59.313]  Now available at m4warsandlife.com.
[01:30:01.004 --> 01:30:02.625]  Joining us is Michael Graves.
[01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:05.848]  Paul Watson put out a video a few days ago, and I was blown away by it.
[01:30:05.908 --> 01:30:06.749]  This is big news.
[01:30:06.849 --> 01:30:10.792]  Former Misfits singer appearance cancelled after social media review.
[01:30:10.992 --> 01:30:11.772]  Michael Graves.
[01:30:12.133 --> 01:30:17.597]  And this is a big deal, because they said, we reviewed him and it's white supremacy and all this made up crap.
[01:30:17.677 --> 01:30:21.000]  And so he's still going to be playing in the town, but this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:22.060]  And what did he get in trouble for?
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.962]  Well, here he is to tell us right now.
[01:30:24.182 --> 01:30:26.524]  Alex, it really came out of the clear blue sky.
[01:30:26.544 --> 01:30:28.906]  My tour manager is also my guitar player.
[01:30:29.766 --> 01:30:38.894]  And I, we had a day off and we were working on some business and we found out about what happened after the festival had posted it.
[01:30:40.315 --> 01:30:50.203]  That they had, like you've said, reviewed my social sites and mainly saw retweets from Paul Joseph Watson from InfoWars.
[01:30:51.301 --> 01:30:54.665]  Uh, from Breitbart, um, on and on.
[01:30:55.126 --> 01:31:02.655]  And it really is a sign of the times, Alex, because about 10 years ago, I went out on tour and did more than 50 states across America.
[01:31:02.675 --> 01:31:04.498]  It was called the War of Information Tour.
[01:31:05.485 --> 01:31:19.030]  And me and my guys, we were handing out InfoWars magazines, bumper stickers that other patriots would bring to us that they had stockpiled from ordering through InfoWars.
[01:31:19.090 --> 01:31:22.551]  And we were disseminating the information and getting the word out.
[01:31:23.032 --> 01:31:24.412]  And no one said, boo.
[01:31:24.852 --> 01:31:28.014]  No one cared that what we were doing.
[01:31:28.574 --> 01:31:31.935]  Now jump to where we are in 2018 and
[01:31:35.894 --> 01:31:39.616]  This is a dangerous thing to come on your show like this.
[01:31:40.217 --> 01:31:46.880]  This will have repercussions, as everyone's seen, just from retweeting.
[01:31:46.981 --> 01:31:52.644]  And like you say, in the arena that you're in, you've hit the barbed wire for a lot of people.
[01:31:53.244 --> 01:32:10.491]  And we all appreciate that, and I certainly appreciate that you and your entire organization has given me, and a lot of other people, the courage to as well, in the arena that I fight in, music and art, cultural expression, to hit the barbed wire as well.
[01:32:10.571 --> 01:32:18.534]  And I hope that, and I know that there's other Patriots out there, there's a lot of young people that are paying attention to this, other bands, other artists,
[01:32:19.255 --> 01:32:30.434]  And the attack on me and seeing what I do and being articulate and being informed about it is going to give the courage and the cover.
[01:32:31.352 --> 01:32:37.096]  For other artists, other musicians to do this regardless of the consequences.
[01:32:37.356 --> 01:32:43.940]  Everybody standing up who's in the public eye and being persecuted, we're all equal when it comes to this on this continuum.
[01:32:44.061 --> 01:32:48.644]  And so for my children, my wife, my family, thank you for being a real man and we really appreciate you.
[01:32:48.664 --> 01:32:50.024]  I look forward to having you back on.
[01:32:50.885 --> 01:32:51.465]  Alex, thank you.
[01:32:51.545 --> 01:32:55.888]  God bless you, your family, your entire organization, everybody associated with you.
[01:32:56.269 --> 01:32:57.049]  Alex, thank you.
[01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.509]  Thank you.
[01:32:57.529 --> 01:32:58.090]  God bless you.
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:06.212]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:31.963 --> 01:33:39.606]  Coming up, I'm going to play a clip of Sarah Sanders at a press conference just minutes ago, pointing out that the Democrats have undermined the entire judicial system.
[01:33:40.166 --> 01:33:46.509]  It's not that the judicial system is perfect, or that America is perfect, but the Democrats work for globalists.
[01:33:46.549 --> 01:33:54.092]  They work for Soros, who undermines and overthrows nation-states to implode them to bring in corporate world government.
[01:33:55.492 --> 01:33:57.534]  So yes, they are an outside globalist arm.
[01:33:58.114 --> 01:33:59.155]  Owen Benjamin's our guest.
[01:33:59.175 --> 01:34:02.598]  We're going to get to some of these clips and get his take on where he thinks things are going.
[01:34:02.618 --> 01:34:04.579]  I'm going to then give the number out and take some of your calls.
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:11.985]  We've got a special report from the leader of the Restart Movement that is one of the main opposition groups, the mullahs in Iran.
[01:34:12.005 --> 01:34:16.729]  This is going to be a pretty big interview coming up that our own Greg Reese did.
[01:34:16.749 --> 01:34:18.410]  We're going to play some excerpts of that.
[01:34:18.430 --> 01:34:19.811]  The interview is now on Infowars.com.
[01:34:21.141 --> 01:34:25.822]  That said, you know, any product we launch is pretty darn powerful.
[01:34:26.682 --> 01:34:32.944]  And I had it earlier, but I took it in the other studio yesterday to shoot a video with it, and also took some of it, so it's down here with me.
[01:34:33.544 --> 01:34:45.027]  But Happies is our newest product at Infowarslife.com, and it's just a whole bunch of known concentrated herbs, ashwagandha root,
[01:34:46.394 --> 01:34:57.488]  Rotiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, licorice root, and more organic concentrated that have been proven in major studies to do amazing things.
[01:34:57.828 --> 01:35:00.992]  They're not suppressants though, they just smooth you out.
[01:35:01.012 --> 01:35:03.575]  I ought to start drinking a lot of this myself, I tell you.
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:06.021]  I want you to try it.
[01:35:06.341 --> 01:35:09.022]  And so the introductory cost is $22.47.
[01:35:09.823 --> 01:35:12.324]  Leading competitors are three times the cost of this.
[01:35:12.704 --> 01:35:15.206]  So even at $44 in normal retail, it's a great deal.
[01:35:15.666 --> 01:35:17.767]  Happy's Mood and Stress is our latest product.
[01:35:18.168 --> 01:35:23.631]  At M4Shore.com, it is 50% off out of the gates.
[01:35:24.691 --> 01:35:32.076]  Also, this is the last day or so whenever I'm going to have some of our best-selling products at 50% off and 40% off, and that is
[01:35:34.901 --> 01:35:37.602]  Brain Force Plus, now 20% more of the Great Nootropic.
[01:35:38.162 --> 01:35:39.943]  It is 40% off.
[01:35:39.983 --> 01:35:41.544]  That's going to have to end today or tomorrow.
[01:35:41.564 --> 01:35:42.664]  We're going to have some new specials.
[01:35:43.184 --> 01:35:44.965]  And then we also have Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:46.766]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[01:35:46.786 --> 01:35:49.106]  That's going to have to end in the next few days.
[01:35:49.547 --> 01:35:51.227]  We also have the Secret 12.
[01:35:51.947 --> 01:35:52.768]  Very high quality.
[01:35:53.848 --> 01:35:56.270]  Organic, concentrated vitamin B12 you take under the tongue.
[01:35:56.811 --> 01:35:58.612]  Look at the 97% it has.
[01:35:58.632 --> 01:36:01.395]  3,000 plus reviews on Power Reviews.
[01:36:01.415 --> 01:36:01.735]  4.9 stars.
[01:36:02.235 --> 01:36:02.956]  Read those reviews.
[01:36:03.356 --> 01:36:09.922]  It has been rated by independent third-party labs as the top vitamin B12 in the country.
[01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:11.711]  Sacred 12.
[01:36:12.192 --> 01:36:14.036]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:36:14.376 --> 01:36:15.559]  It's 40% off right now.
[01:36:15.579 --> 01:36:20.468]  That's going to have to end in the next day or two because we're close to selling out of that and the Brain Force.
[01:36:20.488 --> 01:36:23.173]  But we've got plenty that just came in of Happies!
[01:36:24.299 --> 01:36:26.680]  Which is good for adults, good for children, you name it.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.460]  It's all natural.
[01:36:29.201 --> 01:36:32.002]  It's just concentrated herbs and it is amazing.
[01:36:32.022 --> 01:36:35.463]  Declare war on stress and fatigue with Mother Nature's ultimate weapons.
[01:36:36.283 --> 01:36:36.923]  50% off.
[01:36:37.303 --> 01:36:41.305]  Happy's has what you need to support your mood and take on the day.
[01:36:42.105 --> 01:36:43.525]  And I think it's great at night as well.
[01:36:43.605 --> 01:36:44.506]  It doesn't make you tired.
[01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:47.987]  It does the opposite, but it's not a stimulant, it's not a depressant.
[01:36:49.148 --> 01:36:49.688]  It's amazing.
[01:36:50.088 --> 01:36:54.933]  So, Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:36:54.953 --> 01:36:56.674]  I took a bunch of it yesterday when I went home.
[01:36:57.595 --> 01:36:59.516]  I took like twice the recommended dose.
[01:37:00.017 --> 01:37:01.318]  My wife's like, are you drunk?
[01:37:01.338 --> 01:37:02.699]  I was like, no, I haven't been drinking.
[01:37:02.719 --> 01:37:04.200]  She goes, you're in a really good mood.
[01:37:05.247 --> 01:37:06.948]  You're usually kind of grumpy by 10 o'clock at night.
[01:37:06.968 --> 01:37:07.909]  You're actually really silly.
[01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:10.091]  And I'm just telling you, it's the happy.
[01:37:10.131 --> 01:37:12.133]  So, everybody's physiology is different.
[01:37:12.173 --> 01:37:13.354]  This is all Mother Nature stuff.
[01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:14.535]  It's how you fund us.
[01:37:14.555 --> 01:37:15.575]  Get t-shirts, get books.
[01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:17.537]  The globalists hate it when you fund us.
[01:37:17.557 --> 01:37:25.784]  Now we're going to go back to a very popular national comedian, Owen Benjamin, who's one of the most banned comedians out there, because he has a line in the sand.
[01:37:26.104 --> 01:37:30.348]  And I want to get his take on where he thinks all this ends with the polls I'm going to get to in a moment showing.
[01:37:31.192 --> 01:37:34.874]  Huge surges for Republicans in battleground states.
[01:37:35.214 --> 01:37:36.975]  But the Democrats just can't help themselves.
[01:37:36.995 --> 01:37:39.896]  They have to execute the corrupt power they have.
[01:37:40.236 --> 01:37:41.236]  And they just can't help it.
[01:37:41.276 --> 01:37:42.677]  They can't think a few moves ahead.
[01:37:42.697 --> 01:37:45.758]  But here's Mitch McConnell, who's been the establishment's buddy.
[01:37:46.999 --> 01:37:49.320]  He's getting hounded, called a rapist at airports.
[01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:50.340]  Everybody else is.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.022]  You know, when I hound somebody at an airport, I'm like, hey, why don't you move to Venezuela?
[01:37:54.402 --> 01:37:55.963]  Communism's so good, Bernie Sanders.
[01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:57.303]  And everybody goes, oh, he's so mean to him.
[01:37:57.524 --> 01:37:58.244]  I was very polite.
[01:37:59.858 --> 01:38:01.139]  They're calling him a rapist!
[01:38:01.239 --> 01:38:01.519]  Rape!
[01:38:01.619 --> 01:38:01.900]  Rape!
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:02.260]  Rape!
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:02.600]  Rape!
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:05.182]  Chasing him around, the media's like, oh, this is a really good thing.
[01:38:05.602 --> 01:38:06.843]  So here's Mitch McConnell this morning.
[01:38:08.445 --> 01:38:12.948]  In the far left tried to bully and intimidate members of this body.
[01:38:15.010 --> 01:38:17.852]  Republican United States Senators.
[01:38:19.573 --> 01:38:22.235]  They've tried to bully and intimidate us.
[01:38:24.937 --> 01:38:28.180]  One of our colleagues and his family were effectively run out of a restaurant.
[01:38:28.877 --> 01:38:30.298]  In recent days by these people.
[01:38:32.479 --> 01:38:37.022]  Another reported having protesters physically block his car door.
[01:38:39.363 --> 01:38:45.687]  And some have seen organized far-left protesters camp out at their homes.
[01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:54.973]  I'm not suggesting we're the victims here, Mr. President, but I want to make it clear to these people who are chasing my members around the hall here
[01:38:56.673 --> 01:38:58.133]  Or harassing them at the airports.
[01:38:58.853 --> 01:38:59.814]  Or going to their homes.
[01:38:59.874 --> 01:39:01.554]  We're not being intimidated by these people.
[01:39:02.154 --> 01:39:08.575]  There is no chance in the world they're going to scare us out of doing our duty.
[01:39:11.556 --> 01:39:13.216]  I don't care how many members they chase.
[01:39:14.497 --> 01:39:16.397]  How many people they harass here in the halls.
[01:39:17.137 --> 01:39:18.737]  I want to make one thing perfectly clear.
[01:39:18.797 --> 01:39:21.398]  We will not be intimidated by these people.
[01:39:26.206 --> 01:39:41.137]  This is all part of the organized effort to delay, obstruct, and intimidate, including those of us who will be voting this week.
[01:39:42.357 --> 01:39:44.339]  And he goes on to say the vote will happen on Friday.
[01:39:44.359 --> 01:39:47.161]  I've got one more clip and we'll get Owen Benjamin's take on that.
[01:39:47.661 --> 01:39:55.747]  Here is the ACLU that won't defend the First Amendment of conservatives, libertarians, and Christians now, but they do a shocking video mixing in Bill Clinton
[01:39:57.551 --> 01:40:07.001]  There's a known admitted sexual predator who's settled a bunch of rape cases and flies around on pedophile aircraft with Bill Cosby who is creepy and weird and giving women lewds and getting them drunk.
[01:40:07.061 --> 01:40:07.862]  They're coming to his house.
[01:40:08.743 --> 01:40:11.345]  I think there's some lynch mob going on here and I'm not just defending him.
[01:40:11.766 --> 01:40:12.887]  He's a conservative black guy.
[01:40:12.947 --> 01:40:14.008]  I mean, I'm not defending him.
[01:40:15.049 --> 01:40:16.109]  You know, the jury found him guilty.
[01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:16.449]  Okay.
[01:40:17.150 --> 01:40:18.070]  But I still have some questions.
[01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:20.491]  But Kavanaugh, there's no history of this.
[01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:21.831]  He's not on pedophile airplanes.
[01:40:21.851 --> 01:40:23.372]  He's not settling rape cases.
[01:40:23.412 --> 01:40:25.773]  And then the Democrats defended him over the years.
[01:40:26.273 --> 01:40:28.694]  So that's why this is such a disgusting piece from the ACLU.
[01:40:28.734 --> 01:40:29.034]  Here it is.
[01:40:30.154 --> 01:40:31.215]  We've seen this before.
[01:40:31.495 --> 01:40:33.235]  Denials from powerful men.
[01:40:33.596 --> 01:40:37.457]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.
[01:40:37.918 --> 01:40:39.518]  I've never seen anything like this.
[01:40:40.038 --> 01:40:45.161]  I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford.
[01:40:45.641 --> 01:40:47.122]  America is watching.
[01:40:47.762 --> 01:40:52.424]  And as we choose a lifetime seat on our highest court, integrity matters.
[01:40:52.744 --> 01:40:54.605]  And we cannot have any doubt.
[01:40:55.305 --> 01:40:58.927]  Senator Gardner opposed the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.
[01:41:00.572 --> 01:41:18.905]  So, the ACLU is now against due process and shows a convicted sex abuser, basically a rapist, that's what he's convicted of, Bill Cosby, and then a guy the Democrats defended who's settled rape cases and hangs around with gnome pedophiles on airplanes with little kids.
[01:41:19.285 --> 01:41:20.426]  And so now that's Kavanaugh.
[01:41:20.446 --> 01:41:25.930]  So because these guys did something wrong, they're now not just for due process, Owen Benjamin,
[01:41:26.937 --> 01:41:36.105]  They are now actually saying if another man ever did something, it's like saying if a black man did something wrong, all black men are guilty.
[01:41:36.125 --> 01:41:37.767]  If a white man did it, all white men.
[01:41:37.807 --> 01:41:42.271]  This is the most bigoted, backwards, authoritarian thing I've ever heard of.
[01:41:43.533 --> 01:41:45.454]  Yeah, I mean, they think in demographics.
[01:41:45.774 --> 01:41:46.675]  That's how they think.
[01:41:47.996 --> 01:41:52.378]  They put you in a category and then you have collective guilt that you have nothing to do with.
[01:41:52.999 --> 01:41:59.402]  The good news is, though, the silver lining is it's gonna just iron out, it's gonna get rid of the middle.
[01:41:59.502 --> 01:42:00.283]  I call them the zebras.
[01:42:00.783 --> 01:42:05.468]  Because zebras are striped because the stripes don't look like the Serengeti.
[01:42:05.488 --> 01:42:07.510]  They're striped so they can fit in with other zebras.
[01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:10.492]  So that's why they stay in a pack.
[01:42:10.873 --> 01:42:13.175]  If you just mark a zebra, a lion will immediately kill him.
[01:42:13.475 --> 01:42:16.858]  So that's why there's millions of Americans that I call zebras that are just kind of in the middle.
[01:42:16.918 --> 01:42:20.702]  They're like, they think, like, my grandfather was a lead miner and a Democrat.
[01:42:20.762 --> 01:42:22.524]  Like, that Democratic Party is gone.
[01:42:23.324 --> 01:42:32.526]  And this event will make people, this is a lie in the sand, where if someone now tells me they're on the left, I'm like, you know what they did to Kavanaugh.
[01:42:32.566 --> 01:42:36.327]  You know that they're ruining good men with power acquisition.
[01:42:36.347 --> 01:42:38.848]  It's like, you're not, you can't just tow that lie anymore.
[01:42:38.888 --> 01:42:41.748]  You have to make a stance with truth or a stance against it.
[01:42:41.948 --> 01:42:42.429]  That's right.
[01:42:42.509 --> 01:42:43.749]  It's the wheat from the chaff.
[01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:45.811]  We're making a decision right now.
[01:42:45.851 --> 01:42:49.295]  We're going to come back and get your prediction for the future and more straight ahead.
[01:42:49.315 --> 01:42:52.918]  The next hour, I'm going to take some calls, and we've got a special guest in studio.

[01:44:01.963 --> 01:44:04.344]  In fact, I thought about calling the Capitol Switchboard myself.
[01:44:04.404 --> 01:44:05.244]  Hello!
[01:44:05.744 --> 01:44:08.865]  My name's Alice, but I'm not gonna tell you who I am or where I am.
[01:44:09.205 --> 01:44:12.326]  Brett Kavanaugh gang-raped me with 14 elves.
[01:44:12.666 --> 01:44:14.747]  Yes, it was 49 years ago.
[01:44:14.867 --> 01:44:20.169]  And Brett Kavanaugh, he also flayed my skin and pulled my fingernails out with pliers.
[01:44:20.269 --> 01:44:23.590]  And then, he had an electric drill and he drilled my kneecaps.
[01:44:23.630 --> 01:44:25.370]  Yes, ma'am, we're very sorry.
[01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:26.571]  Now, this is anonymous.
[01:44:26.631 --> 01:44:30.392]  I'm not gonna tell you where or when, just... Okay, Kavanaugh's evil.
[01:44:30.672 --> 01:44:30.972]  Click!
[01:44:31.272 --> 01:44:35.735]  Anonymous accuser says Kavanaugh drilled their kneecaps with a Black & Decker drill.
[01:44:35.915 --> 01:44:36.695]  I can't look at her.
[01:44:36.835 --> 01:44:37.596]  It's like Hillary.
[01:44:37.616 --> 01:44:41.298]  There's the bug-eyed vampire bat look that these people have.
[01:44:41.538 --> 01:44:45.860]  And just knowing how she sits and perches on top of her students.
[01:44:46.681 --> 01:44:49.702]  These universities are these anti-free speech lie machines.
[01:44:49.962 --> 01:44:55.005]  And I've experienced the left and their victriolic fraud and their disinformation.
[01:44:55.105 --> 01:44:56.346]  So maybe I'm biased!
[01:45:16.196 --> 01:45:19.938]  Drew's only been here about four or five months, and he's behind the camera right now.
[01:45:20.218 --> 01:45:26.079]  And I've just done this big pitch for our new product for women that is the best products, the best ingredients we can come up with.
[01:45:26.099 --> 01:45:28.280]  And he said, man, you need to reshoot this.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:29.981]  Literally 20 seconds ago.
[01:45:30.001 --> 01:45:30.481]  And I said, what?
[01:45:31.502 --> 01:45:33.144]  He goes, what's that Virginia Slims ad?
[01:45:33.164 --> 01:45:38.131]  And I went, oh, the one about empowering women smoking cigarettes and killing themselves.
[01:45:38.151 --> 01:45:40.574]  He goes, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[01:45:42.793 --> 01:45:44.793]  And that just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.
[01:45:45.534 --> 01:45:54.876]  So hundreds of millions of women died of lung cancer because the whole feminist movement from the 20s and the 40s was funded by the cigarette makers to get women to smoke.
[01:45:54.956 --> 01:46:00.497]  And they continue that line into the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s saying, you've come a long way.
[01:46:00.937 --> 01:46:02.638]  You can smoke Virginia Slims.
[01:46:03.038 --> 01:46:04.418]  You too can die of lung cancer.
[01:46:05.038 --> 01:46:13.780]  So, Stephen Colbert and all these programs demonize me for promoting known herbs, known vitamins, known trace minerals that are so critical to women.
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:16.821]  My God, iodine is absolutely king, the good halogen.
[01:46:17.101 --> 01:46:23.803]  And then I'm the bad guy all over the news for promoting healthy formulas, but they are promoting pure poison.
[01:46:23.863 --> 01:46:26.664]  So, hey, yeah, women, you've come a long way.
[01:46:26.684 --> 01:46:28.524]  The families are broken up, society's falling
[01:46:28.704 --> 01:46:29.404]  I think so.
[01:47:03.183 --> 01:47:09.427]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.955 --> 01:47:28.499]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:36.527 --> 01:47:45.836]  Owen Benjamin is our guest and we are just watching the insane spectacle of
[01:47:56.246 --> 01:48:10.095]  Just weaponized media, and none of the stories adding up, and no witnesses, and people saying, I don't fly on airplanes, I'm scared, and they're all over the world, and, oh, I don't know anything about polygraphs, and they advise people how to pass them, and it's like, where does it go from here?
[01:48:11.394 --> 01:48:19.859]  Where does it go with the corporate media trying to weaponize men and women against each other and it's in the WikiLeaks how they want race war and then I've got a clip we'll play in a moment.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:26.324]  Kanye West is talking to some nobody TMZ reporter and they tell him take that off your head.
[01:48:27.804 --> 01:48:28.745]  Like he's a slave.
[01:48:28.805 --> 01:48:29.806]  I don't say that because he's black.
[01:48:30.406 --> 01:48:33.108]  I mean it's like I'm saying make America great again.
[01:48:33.768 --> 01:48:35.790]  The cult-like control.
[01:48:36.852 --> 01:48:39.896]  Over corporate media has just become insane.
[01:48:39.936 --> 01:48:42.619]  So Owen Benjamin, where do you think all this ends?
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:48.426]  Well, I think we're seeing the sleeping giant of American patriotism waking up finally.
[01:48:49.046 --> 01:48:54.473]  And I think the future is bright for people that go indie and just do it family style and just
[01:48:55.569 --> 01:48:56.190]  Keep it going.
[01:48:56.230 --> 01:48:58.512]  I just self-produced a special.
[01:48:58.552 --> 01:49:00.694]  You can get it at HugePianist.com.
[01:49:01.094 --> 01:49:10.142]  Because if Netflix won't have me anymore, or Comedy Central, that I've done two specials with, because, you know, Susan Rice is on the board of Netflix, it's like, that's cool.
[01:49:10.202 --> 01:49:11.263]  We still have America.
[01:49:11.344 --> 01:49:16.949]  So I shot my own, and just put it up, and people can enjoy it, just like you doing independent news.
[01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:22.531]  And that's what gets me going every day is the puzzle of it.
[01:49:22.591 --> 01:49:25.193]  Like, how do we get through these monsters?
[01:49:25.213 --> 01:49:34.917]  And I think they've revealed themselves so intensely now that they can't hide behind actual changes that you might think need to be made in society.
[01:49:34.957 --> 01:49:38.099]  Like, they got everything they asked for, plus way more.
[01:49:38.659 --> 01:49:40.301]  And now they're just going for socialism.
[01:49:40.342 --> 01:49:43.886]  So I still think it's the same as what I told you last time.
[01:49:43.966 --> 01:49:48.913]  I think that there's just going to continuously be a giant cultural divide in America.
[01:49:49.273 --> 01:49:52.958]  And I think that people are just going to keep moving towards the right.
[01:49:53.018 --> 01:49:55.562]  That's why they're going to keep trying to import leftist votes.
[01:49:57.742 --> 01:50:04.846]  Well, you're right, and again, you read about times in history where groups of people just doing horribly evil things, and you think, how'd they do that?
[01:50:05.647 --> 01:50:15.553]  They just get wound up, and a lot of times it's a lenient, powerful system or dynasty that liberalizes, and empowers the average person, and then builds up people.
[01:50:15.873 --> 01:50:23.878]  But then, the corrupt kind of sneak in, and they get control, and then we're tolerant of corruption, and then the corruption isn't tolerant of us.
[01:50:24.855 --> 01:50:49.669]  Yeah, and the corruption starts with the individual, and I'm a big history guy, and you saw it with Rome, where it starts with the individual that forgets about their nation and their family, and religion, and right and wrong, and they just start eating all day, and stuffing their faces, and importing slaves, and, you know, getting the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths.
[01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:57.408]  Attila the Hun, all these guys, they were already just coming in because there wasn't good border security in Rome because they just kept raising taxes.
[01:50:58.052 --> 01:51:09.862]  It's a story as old as time, but I have faith that America will fight it with what we have, because we still are a Christian nation, and we just don't hear about it in the media.
[01:51:09.882 --> 01:51:16.047]  That's the smartest thing the left ever did, is they put all the kids in debt from college, and they just took over the flow of information.
[01:51:16.127 --> 01:51:23.313]  That's why a small amount of them can make everyone feel like the world's gone crazy, but as a touring comic, I get to see that people are still good.
[01:51:25.384 --> 01:51:26.244]  At least they're still fighting.
[01:51:26.665 --> 01:51:27.205]  No, you're right.
[01:51:27.725 --> 01:51:30.386]  And what are they going to do if they lose the midterms?
[01:51:30.426 --> 01:51:34.088]  Which I think, unless their election fraud is massive... They're going to lose the midterms.
[01:51:34.768 --> 01:51:35.148]  Yeah.
[01:51:35.188 --> 01:51:37.329]  We have a clip of Newt Gingrich saying that, too.
[01:51:37.349 --> 01:51:38.829]  We're going to play, too.
[01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:39.910]  So what do they do at that point?
[01:51:41.691 --> 01:51:42.631]  Just keep escalating.
[01:51:42.651 --> 01:51:44.352]  Because a liar never comes clean.
[01:51:44.372 --> 01:51:48.593]  Someone like Hillary Clinton, you can see... And we've all known liars in our life.
[01:51:48.613 --> 01:51:49.714]  Like, pathological liars.
[01:51:49.774 --> 01:51:51.915]  Not a white lie that you feel bad about and come clean.
[01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:54.651]  They only add to the lie.
[01:51:55.111 --> 01:52:01.374]  And they will just add to the lie and add to the lie until it just becomes just a crazy person in a corner.
[01:52:02.014 --> 01:52:05.976]  And they don't have as much fundamental power in America as they think.
[01:52:07.237 --> 01:52:10.899]  Our military, our police, all of our food.
[01:52:11.299 --> 01:52:12.980]  None of this is coming from leftists.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.401]  They have the wizard spells.
[01:52:15.941 --> 01:52:17.642]  They're changing the definition of words.
[01:52:17.962 --> 01:52:19.163]  And now they're up to rapists.
[01:52:19.183 --> 01:52:21.424]  Because I was called a Nazi and a white supremacist.
[01:52:21.844 --> 01:52:24.865]  And I was like, how is this possible to use such hyperbole?
[01:52:24.905 --> 01:52:25.585]  This is insane.
[01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:26.846]  What words are left?
[01:52:27.266 --> 01:52:28.706]  And now what's left is rapist.
[01:52:28.886 --> 01:52:32.128]  They would call us pedophiles, but they hold that dear.
[01:52:32.168 --> 01:52:33.548]  They think there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:52:34.028 --> 01:52:35.849]  So now they're calling everybody a rapist.
[01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:37.949]  They sound like they're on PCP.
[01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:47.113]  Owen Benjamin, I want to play, since we mentioned it, the clip of Kanye West.
[01:52:47.553 --> 01:52:50.894]  And then I've got some other clips, since you bring them up, that we're going to be getting to here.
[01:52:52.714 --> 01:53:02.150]  Here's Kanye West sitting at some outdoor restaurant with the TMZ people, and then there's the disrespect of this reporter.
[01:53:02.230 --> 01:53:03.232]  No one even knows who he is.
[01:53:03.592 --> 01:53:05.495]  Here's Kanye West, a trailblazer.
[01:53:06.761 --> 01:53:15.986]  And a guy who's sold over a billion dollars of records, and a guy that just supports bringing America together, and then the disrespect, like they're talking to him like he's a dog.
[01:53:16.486 --> 01:53:22.930]  If I was sitting with some reporter and they said, take that hat off, I'd tell them, listen, why don't you get your crap and get the hell out of here?
[01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:39.332]  Just like Kanye said, I was bullied at Saturday Night Live, and they cut most of his comedy pieces and most of his music pieces, they put comedy in over his music, and basically cut him from the show because he wouldn't submit to them, and it's not even a scandal, but then Kanye West
[01:53:40.578 --> 01:53:47.783]  Comes out and he plugs Alex Jones and Donald Trump as matrix breakers.
[01:53:48.264 --> 01:53:51.686]  Days later, they remove that from a whole bunch of newspapers.
[01:53:52.046 --> 01:53:58.011]  Think of the coordination of corporate news working together to say, we don't want this.
[01:53:58.551 --> 01:54:00.613]  Let's memory hold out of a bunch of newspapers.
[01:54:00.653 --> 01:54:02.354]  That is unbelievable.
[01:54:03.255 --> 01:54:03.455]  Yeah.
[01:54:03.515 --> 01:54:07.698]  And with Kanye, it's crazy because not only is he a massive
[01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:09.710]  He's a star.
[01:54:09.930 --> 01:54:11.551]  He's a clothing designer.
[01:54:11.571 --> 01:54:12.651]  He's married to Kim Kardashian.
[01:54:12.671 --> 01:54:14.052]  He's worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:54:14.432 --> 01:54:17.693]  He also has incredible amounts of street cred in the black community.
[01:54:17.713 --> 01:54:18.873]  He's from Chicago.
[01:54:19.313 --> 01:54:30.216]  You know, his debut album, I think it was Graduation, you know, he's rapping with, like, metal in his mouth from, like, an injury that just is falling out of his mouth in his first video.
[01:54:30.236 --> 01:54:35.758]  Like, he was called a genius in Jay-Z albums because he produced all that.
[01:54:36.098 --> 01:54:37.218]  And they'll take it like that.
[01:54:38.157 --> 01:54:41.258]  You know, my picture is painted on the wall of the Hollywood Improv.
[01:54:41.358 --> 01:54:41.958]  I'm painted.
[01:54:42.278 --> 01:54:45.559]  An artist next to other great comedians painted me.
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:48.961]  And like that, they can unperson you.
[01:54:49.041 --> 01:54:52.642]  But the thing about actual alphas is they, it's okay.
[01:54:52.822 --> 01:54:55.463]  Like, we'll get mad or we'll get, like, stressed.
[01:54:55.883 --> 01:55:01.385]  But I think sometimes conflict can either break a man or it can, like, hone you.
[01:55:01.945 --> 01:55:04.846]  And someone like you, someone like me, someone like Kanye West, it's like,
[01:55:06.375 --> 01:55:08.136]  Jordan Peterson's another great example.
[01:55:08.196 --> 01:55:17.120]  Just some, like, appearingly meek Canadian professor, and they just thought they could hammer him and bully him, and they just created a warrior out of that.
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:21.942]  And we're seeing more and more of that, where they don't realize that they can't break everybody.
[01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:32.849]  And now you've got mainline professors calling for murdering Kavanaugh, murdering Congress, cutting their testicles off, and the media's like, big deal.
[01:55:33.169 --> 01:55:35.710]  And then I say, Antifa's coming to your house to kill you.
[01:55:36.250 --> 01:55:39.031]  If you're a member of Congress, have your rifle ready by your bed.
[01:55:39.392 --> 01:55:40.312]  They don't even quote me.
[01:55:40.332 --> 01:55:42.373]  They just say, Jones said, use rifles to kill the media.
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:46.181]  Again, it's like they've just committed to pure lies.
[01:55:47.122 --> 01:55:50.964]  Oh yeah, well they're now in the pathological state.
[01:55:51.084 --> 01:56:02.389]  And I've known people like this where, you know, whether it's somebody that's cheating on their girlfriend or boyfriend for a long period of time, they get to a point when they could just be like, it's nighttime outside.
[01:56:03.370 --> 01:56:07.732]  And I've known people my whole life like that to a degree where I learned how to deal with it.
[01:56:08.539 --> 01:56:09.819]  And you can't engage.
[01:56:09.859 --> 01:56:15.221]  It's almost like a crazy guy in the street's like, you know, my grandmother's in the orange juice on Mars.
[01:56:15.241 --> 01:56:17.802]  Like you can't be like, no, she's not.
[01:56:18.202 --> 01:56:25.644]  You literally just have to just grind past it and just and just hope that like shadows, they just keep going down.
[01:56:25.965 --> 01:56:27.145]  You know, we have to fight.
[01:56:27.465 --> 01:56:28.585]  We can't just do that.
[01:56:28.705 --> 01:56:33.987]  That whole conservative attitude where it's like they go low, we go high and ignore it and just keep giving up rights.
[01:56:34.007 --> 01:56:34.807]  We're not doing that.
[01:56:35.147 --> 01:56:35.848]  We got to fight.
[01:56:35.868 --> 01:56:36.748]  But at the same time,
[01:56:37.769 --> 01:56:44.315]  The best move is just family, you know, America, working hard, like, achieving things.
[01:56:44.335 --> 01:56:55.045]  Like, the things that make America great, which is free speech, the right to defend ourselves, like, those are the things that we hold tight and keep hammering and just letting the dead wood burn off us by these psychopaths.
[01:56:58.826 --> 01:57:01.148]  Owen Benjamin, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:57:01.168 --> 01:57:02.089]  I really appreciate the time.
[01:57:02.109 --> 01:57:02.649]  It was an honor.
[01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:03.450]  Honor, my friend.
[01:57:03.470 --> 01:57:03.790]  You bet.
[01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:04.230]  You bet.
[01:57:04.411 --> 01:57:07.313]  And, you know, the good news is humanity's waking up.
[01:57:07.673 --> 01:57:10.015]  People are getting out of this, this trance they're in.
[01:57:10.035 --> 01:57:15.339]  Because so many people from TV and radio and smartphones or whatever, they just, they don't have any memory.
[01:57:15.379 --> 01:57:17.201]  It's like they're conscious for like 10 seconds.
[01:57:17.661 --> 01:57:19.983]  And I've learned freedom is having a memory.
[01:57:20.503 --> 01:57:21.084]  Yes, it is.
[01:57:21.124 --> 01:57:21.684]  Context.
[01:57:22.125 --> 01:57:22.565]  Context.
[01:57:22.605 --> 01:57:24.066]  My mom eats digital watches.
[01:57:24.507 --> 01:57:27.269]  She says you need to see where the hands are and where they bend.
[01:57:28.143 --> 01:57:33.584]  You know, it's like context is everything, and not having moms in the home now is not letting you know where we're from.
[01:57:33.704 --> 01:57:36.345]  I talked to people and ten seconds later they don't remember a word I said.
[01:57:37.065 --> 01:57:37.785]  And it's scary.
[01:57:37.805 --> 01:57:39.226]  You're like, I just talked to you.
[01:57:39.566 --> 01:57:41.706]  And I talked to people today, five times.
[01:57:41.786 --> 01:57:43.787]  They remember none of it.
[01:57:43.827 --> 01:57:44.167]  None of it.
[01:57:44.467 --> 01:57:45.207]  Hey, God bless you.
[01:57:45.507 --> 01:57:46.988]  Next hour, coming up, Jam Pack.
[01:57:47.008 --> 01:57:47.408]  Stay with us.
[01:57:56.444 --> 01:58:00.207]  I would be remiss if I did not tip my hat to our sponsors.

[01:59:04.554 --> 01:59:10.359]  If I don't like it though, I'm not going to say it sucks, I'll just say maybe it was me, could be psychosomatic, didn't do nothing for me.
[01:59:11.471 --> 01:59:14.754]  But I have a feeling it will do something, because I'm very sensitive to drugs.
[01:59:14.774 --> 01:59:16.615]  That's why I can't smoke pot anymore.
[01:59:16.995 --> 01:59:18.196]  It's too intense!
[01:59:19.257 --> 01:59:22.299]  My God, have you tried what the kids are smoking these days?
[01:59:22.319 --> 01:59:25.622]  I don't know how Alex Jones survived on Joe Rogan, man.
[01:59:26.342 --> 01:59:28.244]  Last time I tried marijuana...
[01:59:28.904 --> 01:59:30.165]  I had, I was like a narc.
[01:59:30.185 --> 01:59:33.247]  I had to lie down on a cold cement floor shirtless.
[01:59:33.587 --> 01:59:44.794]  And the only reason I didn't call 9-1-1 is because the idea of being in a gurney and going down the elevator and getting, I was at work at the time, and being like put on an ambulance just sounded like too much to bear.
[01:59:52.138 --> 01:59:58.022]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.145 --> 02:00:23.379]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:01:09.804 --> 02:01:10.884]  Alright, we're back live, folks.
[02:01:11.525 --> 02:01:12.265]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:01:12.545 --> 02:01:31.192]  Coming up, we've got a very, very important video that I guess I'll introduce at that time, dealing with the fact that Trump is going to investigate, just like I told you he was going to investigate Big Tech, Trump is set to go after in a big way.
[02:01:32.304 --> 02:01:35.205]  Not just Silicon Valley, but these big mega banks in Silicon Valley.
[02:01:35.225 --> 02:01:40.327]  They're trying to set up a cashless society that penalizes nationalists, conservatives, Christians, you name it.
[02:01:40.367 --> 02:01:41.907]  They are all big threats to humanity.
[02:01:42.348 --> 02:01:43.188]  He talked about that.
[02:01:43.208 --> 02:01:47.349]  How he's going to fight globalists and other threats to humanity in a speech he gave.
[02:01:47.409 --> 02:02:00.234]  So we're going to be going over all of that and we're going to be airing the podcast clips from the story on a website called InfoWars.com.
[02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:06.797]  Apple CEO denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:02:07.618 --> 02:02:11.039]  Even though he bragged about it at the time, how they made the decision to collude.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:15.802]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:02:15.842 --> 02:02:19.584]  So, get your ducks in a row when you run the slave factories in China.
[02:02:20.885 --> 02:02:24.607]  And how they all said that when you made the decision from your Sunday call, and then they did it.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:28.842]  And then so it makes him feel powerful as a gulag owner.
[02:02:29.322 --> 02:02:40.990]  They always have this vice reporter that makes jokes about George Soros being a Nazi, and her eyes are like super far apart, and I'm sorry for her if she had fetal infant alcohol damage.
[02:02:41.010 --> 02:02:41.811]  I'm serious.
[02:02:41.831 --> 02:02:50.576]  It's like, that's what the globalists usually like, put some sad, you know, person that looks like they've got chromosomal damage on television to, uh,
[02:02:51.727 --> 02:02:53.949]  I sit there with Tim Cook so he feels powerful in their presence.
[02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:57.752]  So we're going to be looking at all of that too.
[02:02:59.273 --> 02:03:06.459]  Coming up here today, you know, I'm living in the real world, just so everybody knows.
[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:08.381]  And I'm conscious.
[02:03:09.462 --> 02:03:10.202]  And I have a memory.
[02:03:10.763 --> 02:03:13.125]  And I almost sometimes think a memory is a curse.
[02:03:13.825 --> 02:03:18.369]  You know, maybe that's why Christine Blasey Ford
[02:03:19.980 --> 02:03:23.802]  Works in DARPA funded programs to help erase memories and plant false ones.
[02:03:23.842 --> 02:03:26.903]  Maybe she thinks like that's her area of study because she wants to be happy.
[02:03:26.943 --> 02:03:28.744]  Like she thought, I can go to New Zealand.
[02:03:28.764 --> 02:03:29.884]  I can erase who I am.
[02:03:30.464 --> 02:03:31.605]  My students all hate me.
[02:03:31.745 --> 02:03:32.725]  I'm this huge liar.
[02:03:33.266 --> 02:03:34.726]  My ex-boyfriends hate me.
[02:03:35.126 --> 02:03:36.307]  My ex-husband hates me.
[02:03:36.927 --> 02:03:38.828]  You know, I'm running from myself.
[02:03:39.608 --> 02:03:41.969]  But I've never got on airplanes because I'm so scared.
[02:03:42.450 --> 02:03:44.891]  It just goes to the complete culture of fraud.
[02:03:46.471 --> 02:03:47.852]  So I shot a special report.
[02:03:49.471 --> 02:04:09.685]  That's titled, President Trump set to investigate banks, or President Trump is preparing to investigate bank discrimination, or President Trump is set to investigate banks discriminating against conservatives.
[02:04:10.485 --> 02:04:12.226]  That was the headline when I shot it last night.
[02:04:12.246 --> 02:04:14.248]  It was the headline this morning.
[02:04:14.268 --> 02:04:16.389]  It was the headline an hour ago.
[02:04:16.409 --> 02:04:17.910]  It was the headline 30 minutes ago.
[02:04:24.093 --> 02:04:28.418]  And it's important stuff to you and your family because Revelations is a warning.
[02:04:29.299 --> 02:04:31.001]  You might not want to let this happen.
[02:04:32.343 --> 02:04:34.225]  You know, God lets us kind of choose our own adventure.
[02:04:35.731 --> 02:04:43.653]  And I think a lot of this cashless system is already in place and the prophecy will be fulfilled, but how bad it's going to be, I think, is really up to us.
[02:04:43.693 --> 02:04:45.914]  So, we'll be back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:46.614 --> 02:04:47.574]  We're going to air this piece.
[02:04:48.014 --> 02:04:51.695]  It's very, very important and I suggest everybody pay attention to it.
[02:04:52.455 --> 02:04:53.816]  Newswars.com.
[02:04:53.896 --> 02:04:54.876]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:05:00.561 --> 02:05:10.165]  Just a month ago, that Nazi collaborator, anti-American, gun-grabbing, anti-Christian piece of filth, George Soros, bought an even bigger interest in PayPal.
[02:05:11.305 --> 02:05:16.408]  But sure enough, they just told us today that we're going to be banned in 10 days, because we're taking.
[02:05:16.568 --> 02:05:19.829]  Because we don't support radical Islam and open borders and the rest of it.
[02:05:21.235 --> 02:05:26.701]  Ladies and gentlemen, now more than ever, you supporting InfoWars is changing the world.
[02:05:27.641 --> 02:05:31.045]  And yeah, they're getting rid of PayPal, but we have other ways to process your credit cards.
[02:05:31.545 --> 02:05:37.571]  Your financial support of us is literally buying war bonds in the 21st century war for humanity.
[02:05:37.631 --> 02:05:38.893]  So I want to commend you.
[02:05:39.253 --> 02:05:39.934]  I want to thank you.
[02:05:39.974 --> 02:05:41.575]  We've got great products you already need.
[02:05:42.967 --> 02:05:44.568]  But without you, they will win.
[02:05:45.248 --> 02:05:52.651]  And Soros and Obama and Hillary see the shutdown of Infowars as a referendum on breaking the American spirit.
[02:05:53.232 --> 02:05:54.812]  So let's not let these jerks do it.
[02:05:55.193 --> 02:05:57.194]  I'm committed to the end, but I want to win.
[02:05:57.514 --> 02:06:00.135]  So please support Infowars.com today.
[02:06:12.373 --> 02:06:18.680]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:21.223 --> 02:06:25.587]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:28.379 --> 02:06:33.400]  Who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[02:06:33.841 --> 02:06:42.223]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[02:06:42.363 --> 02:06:53.706]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[02:06:53.826 --> 02:06:55.367]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[02:06:56.147 --> 02:07:12.051]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[02:07:12.091 --> 02:07:14.351]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[02:07:14.811 --> 02:07:21.213]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, your reputation is amazing, I will not let you down.
[02:07:23.871 --> 02:07:25.992]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:07:26.553 --> 02:07:31.776]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:07:35.659 --> 02:07:40.882]  PayPal is creating a global monopoly over online purchases and sales.
[02:07:41.662 --> 02:07:46.926]  Can you imagine the abuse, the tyranny they can carry out if we don't say no to this system?
[02:07:47.759 --> 02:07:50.280]  Do I think my lawsuit against them is going to save the world?
[02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:50.540]  No.
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:59.862]  It's meant to raise an alarm to you, to we the people, and to the president, who's already taken action against big tech and their censorship.
[02:08:00.542 --> 02:08:03.303]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are the modern Paul Reveres.
[02:08:03.683 --> 02:08:05.343]  We are raising the alarm.
[02:08:05.783 --> 02:08:08.204]  And we are winning when we take action.
[02:08:08.544 --> 02:08:16.886]  Almost everybody overuses the Hitler-Nazi analogies, comparing things to contemporary developments in our society.
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:30.467]  Went after his political opposition, Jews and many other groups, and began to cut them out of banking, and out of commerce, and then out of being able to have shops on the streets.
[02:08:31.448 --> 02:08:32.389]  That started in 1933.
[02:08:32.529 --> 02:08:36.731]  By 1937, he had put the Jews and other groups into ghettos.
[02:08:38.733 --> 02:08:43.076]  And so, about a week ago, PayPal said, we've been with you 18 years.
[02:08:43.116 --> 02:08:44.377]  You've been with us 18 years.
[02:08:44.897 --> 02:08:47.439]  You sell books, videos, t-shirts, supplements.
[02:08:48.593 --> 02:08:51.914]  We're not saying you violated our terms of service.
[02:08:53.295 --> 02:09:00.398]  We're saying, for moral reasons, because you're a horrible person, we're going to break off business with you.
[02:09:01.538 --> 02:09:08.321]  So let me be crystal clear about why I filed this lawsuit in San Francisco in PayPal's backyard.
[02:09:10.522 --> 02:09:12.724]  I did it to draw attention to what they're doing.
[02:09:13.724 --> 02:09:15.466]  I did it because it's the right thing to do.
[02:09:15.486 --> 02:09:22.811]  Because we have major banking institutions and Google and Apple moving to China, helping suppress their own population.
[02:09:22.831 --> 02:09:26.933]  We have Google executives and Apple executives going public warning of this.
[02:09:27.634 --> 02:09:34.779]  This is really a dangerous draconian system where this global cashless society that surveils everything we do
[02:09:36.192 --> 02:09:42.134]  ...begins to persecute people for their political views and deny them access to the marketplace.
[02:09:43.255 --> 02:09:44.435]  It's very, very dangerous.
[02:09:45.295 --> 02:09:50.797]  And I'm doing this because the law firms surrounding the president are part of the swamp and they're scared to do it.
[02:09:51.518 --> 02:09:54.199]  But I'm not scared to do it.
[02:09:54.239 --> 02:09:57.300]  We are seeing real bonafide authoritarianism here.
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:00.261]  So that's my big message to Big Tech.
[02:10:01.542 --> 02:10:02.862]  This isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:10:02.942 --> 02:10:05.263]  It's not even about winning this lawsuit.
[02:10:06.525 --> 02:10:11.590]  It's about drawing attention to what you're doing and making a stand.
[02:10:12.090 --> 02:10:14.773]  We filed this lawsuit last night and already today there's hundreds of articles.
[02:10:15.133 --> 02:10:19.177]  Alex Jones sues PayPal after Infowars banned for hate and intolerance.
[02:10:19.838 --> 02:10:21.559]  That's defamation on its face.
[02:10:23.001 --> 02:10:26.204]  Even if I was a racist, I deserve to be able to have banking.
[02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:35.395]  I support Martin Luther King and the ideas of standing with people for their ideas and what they produce and who they are, not what color they are.
[02:10:35.855 --> 02:10:38.858]  Everyone knows that the KKK and the Nazis hate me.
[02:10:40.119 --> 02:10:50.246]  So that defamation of them defining me as hate and intolerance and blowing me out the political airlock so I can't even engage in commerce is incredibly dangerous.
[02:10:50.967 --> 02:10:51.667]  Here's another headline.
[02:10:51.707 --> 02:10:56.171]  Alex Jones files lawsuit trying to force PayPal to reinstate Infowars account.
[02:10:57.677 --> 02:11:11.841]  What we're doing is pointing out that after 18 years of doing business with us, you are attempting to rape our rights to access to the free market and defaming us at the same time with some nebulous term like hate.
[02:11:12.541 --> 02:11:15.502]  Alex Jones sues PayPal.
[02:11:15.562 --> 02:11:18.683]  PayPal sued over a block of Alex Jones Infowars.
[02:11:19.583 --> 02:11:20.464]  It goes on and on.
[02:11:21.944 --> 02:11:24.825]  And there's a final article out of the Washington Post.
[02:11:27.009 --> 02:11:30.891]  It says, how Alex Jones is poisoning the antitrust debate.
[02:11:31.972 --> 02:11:33.833]  This was syndicated across the country today.
[02:11:35.554 --> 02:11:41.478]  You have over 90 big tech companies, all in San Francisco, banning me on every platform you can imagine.
[02:11:41.878 --> 02:11:45.340]  Even LinkedIn, saying I can't even say I'm available for hire.
[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:48.702]  Telling me to go to my ghetto and starve to death and die.
[02:11:50.742 --> 02:12:03.627]  So let me give the arrogant SOBs at the big tech companies who make trillions of dollars and are all tax-exempt and run the worst slave factories in China, in Google's case, or Apple's case.
[02:12:05.927 --> 02:12:07.188]  You won't be so arrogant soon.
[02:12:08.223 --> 02:12:10.204]  Because humanity's waking up to what you've done.
[02:12:10.244 --> 02:12:14.567]  The inventor of the internet admits you're an authoritarian threat and is developing systems to counter you.
[02:12:15.347 --> 02:12:17.468]  You thought humanity had submitted to your tyranny.
[02:12:17.848 --> 02:12:18.449]  We were asleep.
[02:12:18.849 --> 02:12:22.571]  And now all you've done is awaken the spirit of humanity.
[02:12:22.611 --> 02:12:23.492]  You've awakened her.
[02:12:24.272 --> 02:12:27.474]  I'm not being censored because I'm stupid or goofy or fake news.
[02:12:27.794 --> 02:12:31.816]  I'm being censored, like Tucker Carlson said, because I'm changing the world.
[02:12:32.217 --> 02:12:34.638]  Thanks to our viewers and our listeners who are taking action.
[02:12:35.276 --> 02:12:37.117]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[02:12:37.357 --> 02:12:39.057]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:39.157 --> 02:12:41.879]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:12:42.079 --> 02:12:42.819]  Alex Jones.
[02:12:42.899 --> 02:12:43.939]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:12:43.999 --> 02:12:46.880]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[02:12:47.100 --> 02:12:50.302]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:12:50.382 --> 02:12:52.322]  Alex Jones, the nut job radio guy.
[02:12:52.342 --> 02:12:53.883]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[02:12:53.963 --> 02:12:59.245]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories, you have to wonder if he really believes half of what he says.
[02:12:59.265 --> 02:13:00.385]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:01.646]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:13:01.966 --> 02:13:02.827]  This isn't a game!
[02:13:02.907 --> 02:13:03.628]  Hate speech.
[02:13:03.848 --> 02:13:05.849]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[02:13:05.869 --> 02:13:10.233]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[02:13:10.253 --> 02:13:12.375]  1776 will commence again if you try to take...
[02:13:14.352 --> 02:13:16.153]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[02:13:16.333 --> 02:13:17.894]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[02:13:18.074 --> 02:13:21.236]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[02:13:21.376 --> 02:13:23.878]  It's an internet talk show called Info Wars.
[02:13:24.018 --> 02:13:26.339]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:13:26.759 --> 02:13:29.421]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[02:13:29.461 --> 02:13:32.242]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S.
[02:13:32.282 --> 02:13:37.045]  government, saying that they stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S.
[02:13:37.165 --> 02:13:37.966]  citizens.
[02:13:38.086 --> 02:13:39.607]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:13:39.827 --> 02:13:42.028]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:13:42.308 --> 02:13:43.469]  That man's a threat to this country.
[02:13:43.749 --> 02:13:45.110]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[02:13:45.130 --> 02:13:46.430]  Deeply, I think, racist.
[02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:48.211]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:13:48.331 --> 02:13:50.052]  He's considered legitimate among the crazy.
[02:13:50.212 --> 02:13:56.194]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.
[02:13:56.414 --> 02:13:57.115]  I'd love to see that.
[02:13:57.855 --> 02:13:58.535]  In uniform.
[02:13:59.896 --> 02:14:03.277]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:14:04.538 --> 02:14:05.158]  I like that guy.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.643]  We have gangsters running this country.
[02:14:24.004 --> 02:14:24.524]  Criminals!
[02:14:24.665 --> 02:14:25.165]  Gangsters!
[02:14:25.225 --> 02:14:28.210]  The bigger this war gets, the more freedoms we lose.
[02:14:30.563 --> 02:14:33.985]  We have a fog that has descended upon our entire nation.
[02:14:34.045 --> 02:14:36.367]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[02:14:36.387 --> 02:14:38.208]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[02:14:38.429 --> 02:14:43.532]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spades.
[02:14:44.193 --> 02:14:44.993]  This is as real as it gets.
[02:14:45.393 --> 02:14:48.836]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face, it's over for me.
[02:14:49.016 --> 02:14:50.117]  I said, Matt, it's over for you.
[02:14:50.377 --> 02:14:52.558]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[02:14:52.839 --> 02:14:53.459]  You're out of there.
[02:14:53.719 --> 02:14:55.400]  You want it, baby?
[02:14:55.661 --> 02:14:57.242]  You're about to get it.
[02:15:03.928 --> 02:15:11.971]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant, and see how many guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[02:15:12.351 --> 02:15:16.953]  We met them at Concord Bridge, and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[02:15:17.273 --> 02:15:29.277]  InfoWars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of that.
[02:15:29.457 --> 02:15:32.718]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women.
[02:15:32.758 --> 02:15:37.640]  No, Bill rapes them physically, and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:47.623]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[02:15:47.843 --> 02:15:50.084]  These people are of the devil.
[02:15:50.124 --> 02:15:52.945]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[02:15:53.685 --> 02:15:58.147]  We'll be back with Sam Cooke lying through his filthy rodent face.
[02:15:59.488 --> 02:16:00.308]  I'll answer, I'll answer.
[02:16:00.749 --> 02:16:03.890]  I don't like the fact that he is putting kids in cage.
[02:16:04.050 --> 02:16:06.692]  That's not, that's not, that's inhumane, if you ask me.
[02:16:06.792 --> 02:16:07.432]  It's not right.
[02:16:07.912 --> 02:16:09.453]  I don't like the fact that he's separating families.
[02:16:09.493 --> 02:16:12.814]  I don't think you would have liked to be separated whenever you were younger, you know what I'm saying?
[02:16:13.215 --> 02:16:14.595]  And I have a strong bond with my mom.
[02:16:14.615 --> 02:16:17.016]  I would have never pictured myself being separated by my mom.
[02:16:17.337 --> 02:16:21.479]  I would have never, I know, you know, I know the feeling that the kids have.
[02:16:21.839 --> 02:16:22.439]  And it's sad.
[02:16:22.739 --> 02:16:25.240]  Every time I watch the news, there's even more kids being caged up.
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:26.081]  That's not right.
[02:16:26.621 --> 02:16:28.242]  Dogs are caged up, not humans.
[02:16:28.482 --> 02:16:33.785]  So are you talking about the issue of people being deported that are here illegally?
[02:16:33.805 --> 02:16:35.966]  No, I'm not saying that, and I'm not saying that.
[02:16:36.026 --> 02:16:41.209]  I'm just saying that he shouldn't cage up kids who have families who support them and love them, you know what I'm saying?
[02:16:41.269 --> 02:16:45.872]  I don't think it's right for him to be separating children at such a young age, you know?
[02:16:45.892 --> 02:16:54.257]  So are you talking about the issue where you had all the Times and a bunch of these articles talking about how kids were being separated from their family at the border?
[02:16:54.577 --> 02:16:56.038]  Yeah, I think that's really inhumane.
[02:16:56.058 --> 02:16:56.818]  I don't think it's right.
[02:16:57.319 --> 02:17:09.706]  Did you hear about how the little girl who was pictured on Time Magazine crying, that her parents came out and said that that was fake because they were with her the whole time and she was just kind of having a little temper tantrum?
[02:17:10.227 --> 02:17:16.230]  And they took that picture and they lied and said that she was a child that was being taken from her family when she never was.
[02:17:16.550 --> 02:17:17.311]  Did you hear about that?
[02:17:18.171 --> 02:17:19.452]  All right, that's one, right?
[02:17:19.552 --> 02:17:20.352]  That's one.
[02:17:20.392 --> 02:17:21.833]  That's one person who lied.
[02:17:21.873 --> 02:17:22.973]  That's one person who lied.
[02:17:23.013 --> 02:17:24.494]  That's not just not all of them.
[02:17:24.514 --> 02:17:25.594]  That's not all of them.
[02:17:25.795 --> 02:17:26.655]  That's not all of them.
[02:17:26.715 --> 02:17:27.555]  You can get out of here.
[02:17:27.675 --> 02:17:28.556]  You can get out of here.
[02:17:28.596 --> 02:17:29.276]  You can get out of here.
[02:17:29.296 --> 02:17:30.717]  Get in my f***ing face!
[02:17:30.877 --> 02:17:31.777]  I'm not in your space.
[02:17:31.837 --> 02:17:32.537]  Get in my face.
[02:17:32.557 --> 02:17:33.818]  You're in my space.
[02:17:33.838 --> 02:17:34.898]  Can I say something?
[02:17:34.938 --> 02:17:35.199]  Yeah.
[02:17:35.339 --> 02:17:37.860]  If you guys don't care, I'm an immigrant.
[02:17:38.280 --> 02:17:39.240]  I'm from Argentina.
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:41.881]  I came here the right way.
[02:17:41.981 --> 02:17:44.382]  You have to understand that.
[02:17:50.886 --> 02:17:54.007]  They're down in America.
[02:17:54.027 --> 02:17:56.248]  Look what one of them did to my daughter.
[02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:57.009]  What happened?
[02:17:57.029 --> 02:17:57.529]  Can you tell us?
[02:17:57.569 --> 02:18:07.914]  Yeah, this is Mark DUI in Jonesboro and an illegal hit her head on doing over a hundred mile an hour and had three of his kids in his car and my grandson was with my daughter.
[02:18:08.355 --> 02:18:09.075]  My daughter died.
[02:18:10.256 --> 02:18:11.877]  I don't ever get to see my daughter again.
[02:18:12.557 --> 02:18:19.020]  He left the country, a sorry sheriff we got, let him walk right out of the hospital, right out of the county, and he's gone.
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:20.161]  He's in Mexico.
[02:18:20.481 --> 02:18:25.423]  Our country is so sorry they won't go to Mexico and get nobody, but they allowed him to come here!
[02:18:25.443 --> 02:18:31.566]  So you're really upset because you lost your daughter to the illegal immigration issue?
[02:18:31.646 --> 02:18:32.927]  On his fourth DUI!
[02:18:33.727 --> 02:18:35.828]  He was on probation for his third DUI!
[02:18:36.449 --> 02:18:37.229]  How would you feel?
[02:18:38.041 --> 02:18:39.042]  Is this your grandbaby?
[02:18:39.202 --> 02:18:40.082]  This is one of them.
[02:18:40.102 --> 02:18:41.383]  Yeah, I got seven of them.
[02:18:41.643 --> 02:18:44.145]  Well, I'm sorry for your loss.
[02:18:44.185 --> 02:18:44.865]  That's horrible.
[02:18:46.386 --> 02:18:49.468]  Well, there ain't nothing that nobody can say to make me feel any better.
[02:18:49.688 --> 02:18:54.011]  We were permanently separated, not just for a week or a month.
[02:18:54.291 --> 02:18:56.852]  I was at home when I got the phone call from the hospital.
[02:18:57.133 --> 02:19:00.915]  He was hit head-on by a repeat illegal alien criminal.
[02:19:01.255 --> 02:19:07.340]  Known gang member came in the back and he fired the gun and struck my son in the arm.
[02:19:07.561 --> 02:19:10.263]  Trying to get away, he drove over my son's body.
[02:19:10.363 --> 02:19:13.305]  He backed up, driving over him a second time.
[02:19:13.325 --> 02:19:15.567]  Rear end is estimated 62 mile an hour.
[02:19:16.348 --> 02:19:18.971]  He strangled him and let him go to see if he was breathing.
[02:19:19.051 --> 02:19:21.313]  Strangled him over and over and over until death.
[02:19:21.534 --> 02:19:24.136]  And he dragged Matthew a quarter of a mile to his death.
[02:19:24.457 --> 02:19:27.239]  He rear-ended her, killing her.
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:33.967]  He went to a field and put Josh out and put the gasoline on him and lit him on fire.
[02:19:34.287 --> 02:19:37.190]  Previously deported about a year and a half to two years before.
[02:19:37.210 --> 02:19:38.792]  This man wasn't supposed to be here.
[02:19:39.432 --> 02:19:40.173]  My separation.
[02:19:40.193 --> 02:19:41.093]  My separation.
[02:19:41.113 --> 02:19:41.934]  My separation.
[02:19:41.974 --> 02:19:42.954]  My separation.
[02:19:43.134 --> 02:19:44.015]  My separation.
[02:19:44.055 --> 02:19:44.915]  My separation.
[02:19:44.935 --> 02:19:47.417]  My separation is permanent.
[02:19:47.477 --> 02:19:47.997]  Permanent.
[02:19:48.177 --> 02:19:48.617]  Permanent.
[02:19:48.877 --> 02:19:49.198]  Permanent.
[02:19:49.498 --> 02:19:49.898]  Permanent.
[02:19:49.978 --> 02:19:50.478]  Permanent.
[02:19:50.899 --> 02:19:57.242]  Our separation is permanent.
[02:20:03.706 --> 02:20:06.387]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:14.380 --> 02:20:15.100]  He's not a tough guy.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.601]  He's a bully and he's a bitch.
[02:20:16.721 --> 02:20:17.401]  He's a punk.
[02:20:18.402 --> 02:20:19.142]  He's a dog.
[02:20:19.402 --> 02:20:20.683]  He's a pig.
[02:20:20.943 --> 02:20:22.423]  And he can suck my f***ing a**.
[02:20:22.603 --> 02:20:25.024]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:20:25.225 --> 02:20:29.306]  I'll meet him in a hotel room any motherf***ing day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger.
[02:20:29.326 --> 02:20:30.907]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[02:20:31.047 --> 02:20:35.269]  Kiss my motherf***ing a**, you bitch, punk, tough sucker.
[02:20:44.226 --> 02:20:52.358]  Pointing what appears to be a water gun at the image of President Donald Trump projected on a whiteboard, art teacher Pale Modi has now been seen by countless viewers across the internet.
[02:20:52.398 --> 02:20:52.839]  Yes!
[02:20:53.961 --> 02:20:58.588]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:21:00.815 --> 02:21:07.036]  It's an actor dressed to look just like President Donald Trump as he's assassinated on stage.
[02:21:07.236 --> 02:21:16.058]  Pictures and video depicting comedian Kathy Griffin holding the bloody decapitated head of President Trump are no joking matter for the Secret Service.
[02:21:16.118 --> 02:21:22.180]  The rhetoric that has inspired the violence has come from the mainstream of the Democratic Party.
[02:21:22.320 --> 02:21:27.481]  They're involved in the coup, an active attempt to start a bloody civil war.
[02:21:41.201 --> 02:22:05.486]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are a resistance soldier.
[02:22:05.966 --> 02:22:09.507]  Alright folks, so we're back live.
[02:22:10.783 --> 02:22:25.954]  Old CEO of Apple that owns the worst and runs the worst factories in China, and who pays zero global tax, and pays no tax in China, who's batted against America, but it's okay because he's gay, so he prances around, so it's okay.
[02:22:27.195 --> 02:22:35.341]  Bloodthirsty, soulless vampire Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, denies colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:22:35.801 --> 02:22:38.403]  I've never had any conversation about this with any
[02:22:39.445 --> 02:22:44.489]  I've never had any conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:22:45.210 --> 02:22:46.331]  Well, really, I can pull up
[02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:12.233]  Congressional hearings, I can pull up the New York Times, I can pull up the Washington Post, I can pull up BuzzFeed just three weeks ago.
[02:23:12.573 --> 02:23:16.995]  Tech giants meet in secret at Twitter to discuss how to handle the midterms.
[02:23:23.138 --> 02:23:24.958]  So there it is on screen for you right there.
[02:23:26.259 --> 02:23:27.139]  And they're so proud of it.
[02:23:27.199 --> 02:23:32.942]  And they all work in concert where Apple and Google and Facebook, when they banned me,
[02:23:34.178 --> 02:23:39.241]  They will all release giant articles written days before on the exact minute.
[02:23:40.081 --> 02:23:44.523]  AP, Reuters, USA Today, BuzzFeed, all of it will all be at 447!
[02:23:47.346 --> 02:23:48.526]  They all release the article.
[02:23:49.047 --> 02:23:50.567]  Every time, it's at the same minute.
[02:23:50.807 --> 02:23:53.849]  Maybe in the morning, maybe in the evening, but it's all the same minute.
[02:23:53.869 --> 02:23:56.110]  They all get together, and they all come up with their story.
[02:23:56.410 --> 02:23:59.131]  Racist, evil, Nazi, demon that hates America.
[02:23:59.151 --> 02:24:02.632]  You know, blah, blah, blah, and then they release the fraud in unison.
[02:24:03.753 --> 02:24:08.154]  Oh, but Tim Cook, he's never heard of this in his life.
[02:24:10.055 --> 02:24:11.536]  Then he was being interviewed by the, uh,
[02:24:12.754 --> 02:24:16.776]  These globalists love to have someone that appears to be mentally deficient interview him, makes him feel more powerful.
[02:24:17.056 --> 02:24:20.218]  That's like a little, kind of like a deformed jester, you know, in the old days.
[02:24:20.238 --> 02:24:21.018]  That's what they always do.
[02:24:21.038 --> 02:24:29.163]  So they have this flounder that's been living in a nuclear weapons reactor cooling tank, interviewing him.
[02:24:30.251 --> 02:24:34.336]  Apple's CEO colluding with tech giants to ban Alex Jones.
[02:24:34.437 --> 02:24:37.881]  I've never even had a conversation about this money tech company.
[02:24:38.382 --> 02:24:42.006]  Oh yes, and Google and Facebook and all you, you don't censor anybody either.
[02:24:42.267 --> 02:24:46.312]  Even though Apple admits they've given all your Apple ID's to the Chinese Communist government.
[02:24:46.372 --> 02:24:48.375]  I mean, what a lying...
[02:24:50.947 --> 02:24:52.969]  So the article's up on Infowars.com.
[02:24:53.009 --> 02:24:53.810]  Hey, great headline.
[02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:54.730]  Apple CEO denies.
[02:24:54.771 --> 02:24:56.973]  How about Apple CEO lies through his teeth?
[02:24:57.933 --> 02:24:59.675]  Says, no colluding by tech giants.
[02:24:59.735 --> 02:25:00.236]  Yeah, right.
[02:25:00.536 --> 02:25:03.859]  Well, let's get that antitrust lawsuits going, and let's get all your records.
[02:25:04.039 --> 02:25:06.181]  Just like Google says, oh, we don't censor.
[02:25:06.481 --> 02:25:10.245]  They just said the day after Hillary lost, we're going to make sure this never happens again.
[02:25:10.265 --> 02:25:12.747]  And it's in all the WikiLeaks.
[02:25:16.210 --> 02:25:16.851]  What a monster.
[02:25:20.071 --> 02:25:21.092]  So, let's go ahead.
[02:25:21.353 --> 02:25:24.797]  Tim Cook helps censor in China, and Google helps censor in China.
[02:25:25.558 --> 02:25:26.339]  Political dissidents.
[02:25:26.359 --> 02:25:31.285]  Let's go ahead and hear him sit there and tell you how much he's never colluded with anybody.
[02:25:31.325 --> 02:25:31.586]  Here it is.
[02:25:32.808 --> 02:25:34.829]  How did you decide to ban Alex Jones?
[02:25:35.289 --> 02:25:40.011]  What users want from us, and what we've always provided them, is a curated platform.
[02:25:40.611 --> 02:25:42.392]  We don't take a political stand.
[02:25:42.432 --> 02:25:44.513]  We're not leaning one way or the other.
[02:25:44.773 --> 02:25:49.735]  You can tell that from the stuff on the App Store and in podcasts, etc.
[02:25:49.975 --> 02:25:53.477]  You'll see everything from very conservative to very liberal.
[02:25:54.025 --> 02:25:57.306]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it, Alex Jones has to go?
[02:25:57.426 --> 02:26:00.007]  You know, don't we get into a singular kind of event?
[02:26:00.368 --> 02:26:10.632]  But I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be all.
[02:26:10.792 --> 02:26:14.013]  Did you coordinate with other tech companies to kick off Alex Jones?
[02:26:14.053 --> 02:26:14.253]  No.
[02:26:15.034 --> 02:26:18.355]  I've never even had a conversation about this with any tech company.
[02:26:18.375 --> 02:26:19.155]  Why not?
[02:26:19.195 --> 02:26:20.836]  We make our decisions independently.
[02:26:21.636 --> 02:26:22.857]  And I think that's important.
[02:26:23.908 --> 02:26:25.869]  What a lion's sack of crap.
[02:26:28.611 --> 02:26:32.233]  They admitted that they had their little Sunday meeting and talked to other tech.
[02:26:32.313 --> 02:26:33.854]  That came out in the news at the time.
[02:26:34.715 --> 02:26:36.376]  And that he led the charge to do that.
[02:26:37.596 --> 02:26:38.597]  Oh, but he curates.
[02:26:38.617 --> 02:26:40.338]  Kind of like Hitler was curating in England.
[02:26:40.778 --> 02:26:41.619]  Or maybe the Communists.
[02:26:41.639 --> 02:26:43.240]  You know, Stalin was curating in Russia.
[02:26:44.921 --> 02:26:45.962]  You know, just curating.
[02:26:47.683 --> 02:26:52.726]  Oh, you're just curating in China with the worst factories over there and the suicide nets and the forced drugging.
[02:26:54.073 --> 02:26:55.774]  And trying to replace humans with robots?
[02:26:56.815 --> 02:27:00.918]  You're just curating when you defend the communist regime that sells political dissidents organs.
[02:27:01.258 --> 02:27:03.660]  Because you're the big, high and mighty Tim Cook!
[02:27:03.680 --> 02:27:07.402]  And you're not involved in anything political, oh no!
[02:27:07.823 --> 02:27:15.168]  Apple doesn't give almost all its money to the Democratic Party and other socialist parties around the world while you're tax exempt and big, rich, trillionaire pigs.
[02:27:15.488 --> 02:27:15.949]  Your company.
[02:27:17.089 --> 02:27:22.013]  You're a total, virtue-signaling, gigantic, galactic-sized fraud.
[02:27:24.147 --> 02:27:26.449]  And you think you've defeated humanity, but you haven't.
[02:27:27.169 --> 02:27:35.356]  And you think by demonizing me, you build the straw man for the first domino to take free speech, and then shut everybody else down, but you have miserably failed.
[02:27:36.797 --> 02:27:39.299]  Now they're trying to take away our processing, and I've sued
[02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:49.133]  PayPal over it, and I didn't sue PayPal because we need them as a process server, or as a group to process the orders.
[02:27:49.854 --> 02:27:56.716]  I did it because they're going to move on to all the others, which they've done, and it's going to be a cashless society like China, where if you're not a good little glob, well, she can't buy or sell.
[02:27:56.937 --> 02:28:01.098]  So I did it for everybody to draw attention to the President, which I know is getting ready to take action.
[02:28:01.579 --> 02:28:06.901]  So that's what I did, was to point out what you're doing to conservatives and Christians and others.
[02:28:08.288 --> 02:28:09.430]  So they banned us on Apple.
[02:28:09.450 --> 02:28:12.515]  You can still get the Android app free at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:28:12.795 --> 02:28:14.498]  And the power of you, the listeners, spreading the word.
[02:28:14.538 --> 02:28:18.504]  Hey, to your friends and family, if you've got an Android or a device that isn't Apple, get it!

[02:29:32.761 --> 02:29:33.361]  But guess what?

[02:30:38.230 --> 02:30:41.053]  Apple banned your app.
[02:30:42.935 --> 02:30:43.896]  I helped too!
[02:30:44.436 --> 02:30:45.377]  Ah, Oliver.
[02:30:51.633 --> 02:30:53.935]  We hate free speech!

[02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:02.883]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses Silversol technology.
[02:31:03.183 --> 02:31:06.626]  There's been extensive research on Silversol technology.

[02:31:16.995 --> 02:31:17.376]  ...study.
[02:31:17.676 --> 02:31:20.420]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[02:31:20.781 --> 02:31:25.748]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[02:31:25.788 --> 02:31:28.151]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[02:31:28.431 --> 02:31:33.078]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[02:31:33.118 --> 02:31:33.699]  Ah, you don't want that.

[02:33:03.523 --> 02:33:06.144]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.618 --> 02:33:22.345]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.766 --> 02:33:25.677]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:33:39.341 --> 02:33:45.467]  All right, I just went on during the break and I said to Tommy, I said, listen, you need to talk about yourself, OK?
[02:33:46.027 --> 02:33:47.048]  Because you can't get him to do it.
[02:33:47.889 --> 02:33:50.592]  And if they made a movie about Tommy Robinson,
[02:33:52.537 --> 02:33:58.022]  Because I remember hearing about him like 12 years ago, this guy exposing rape gangs, English Defense League, he's a racist, he wasn't.
[02:33:58.683 --> 02:34:01.706]  Then they brought in racists, he left the league, he works for the Sikhs and others.
[02:34:02.247 --> 02:34:05.370]  You don't have Sikhs, and I know the statistics, one of the lowest crime rates in the world.
[02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:09.414]  They got formed hundreds of years ago because the Islamists were trying to kill them in India.
[02:34:10.135 --> 02:34:11.676]  The Hindus, they're not doing anything.
[02:34:11.736 --> 02:34:16.321]  I mean, okay, Hindus are kind of like Texans, maybe they don't pay their income tax, but that's about it.
[02:34:18.216 --> 02:34:21.304]  So yeah, but you know, it's not even about the genetics.
[02:34:21.364 --> 02:34:25.054]  A lot of these Arabs have similar genetics to Sikhs or people in India.
[02:34:26.525 --> 02:34:27.246]  It's the culture.
[02:34:27.346 --> 02:34:28.266]  It's what Mohammed did.
[02:34:28.286 --> 02:34:29.967]  Does that mean I want to have war with Islam?
[02:34:30.007 --> 02:34:30.188]  No.
[02:34:30.528 --> 02:34:32.129]  But they've got 1.8 billion people.
[02:34:32.169 --> 02:34:33.950]  They're about to be 3 billion in the middle of the next decade.
[02:34:34.390 --> 02:34:39.073]  The globalists have made their bet on them and this whole plan to repopulate Europe with Islamists.
[02:34:39.113 --> 02:34:42.616]  And then we're supposed to just die and give ourselves over.
[02:34:42.636 --> 02:34:44.757]  So, Tommy, I want to get back into what's happening.
[02:34:44.777 --> 02:34:45.618]  You've already proven it.
[02:34:45.638 --> 02:34:51.142]  I know you just can't be stopped to warn about the girls being raped and the kidnapping because you've got a bunch of children.
[02:34:51.742 --> 02:34:53.343]  And they've been threatened with ass attack.
[02:34:53.363 --> 02:34:54.144]  You don't want to get into that.
[02:34:54.925 --> 02:34:57.080]  Talk about just what you've been through.
[02:34:58.362 --> 02:35:25.015]  In like a five minute gestalt, how it began, you're in prison, taking your house, three months, losing all the weight, them putting you by the mosque in the jail, them throwing feces on you, and then again, now you got a court date, I don't know what you can get into on air, I know the inside baseball, they're wanting you to say certain things that they might send you back, so I want you to be very careful here, because the world's listening, they admire you, they support you, because you are the real deal.
[02:35:25.595 --> 02:35:27.636]  But we need to focus on Tommy.
[02:35:28.056 --> 02:35:28.416]  Tommy.
[02:35:28.876 --> 02:35:29.216]  Tommy.
[02:35:29.696 --> 02:35:30.937]  Tommy Robinson online.
[02:35:31.417 --> 02:35:32.777]  Tommy Robinson dot online.
[02:35:33.118 --> 02:35:34.158]  Twitter, for now.
[02:35:34.178 --> 02:35:35.078]  Are they banned you there yet?
[02:35:35.198 --> 02:35:36.439]  T. Robinson, New Era?
[02:35:36.819 --> 02:35:37.439]  I'm gone, mate.
[02:35:37.499 --> 02:35:38.279]  I'm banned off Twitter.
[02:35:38.299 --> 02:35:39.260]  That's right, so we can't go there.
[02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:41.480]  Where are the best places to contact you first?
[02:35:42.361 --> 02:35:44.061]  Because everybody's getting hurt.
[02:35:44.121 --> 02:35:45.061]  And talk about yourself.
[02:35:45.342 --> 02:35:45.982]  Talk about yourself.
[02:35:47.262 --> 02:35:52.524]  So, from when I first started activism, within the first
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:58.265]  Six months, my house and my parents' houses were raided by the police three times.
[02:35:59.226 --> 02:36:03.250]  This has become a common thing over the years that continues.
[02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:05.132]  Go back to the time, what you were witnessing.
[02:36:06.574 --> 02:36:11.158]  So, we were holding demonstrations and we were highlighting these issues.
[02:36:11.659 --> 02:36:16.164]  Now, the same police force that just imprisoned me outside the court case in Leeds,
[02:36:16.886 --> 02:36:20.669]  When we first started, I'd organised a demonstration in that police force.
[02:36:21.190 --> 02:36:27.416]  South Yorkshire Police Force is the police force that's come out and been proven as hiding all of these problems.
[02:36:27.956 --> 02:36:33.421]  Now when I first come to their borough... In fact, didn't it turn out in a lot of departments some of the leading cops are involved in the pimping?
[02:36:34.936 --> 02:36:40.978]  Some of the leading cops, we've had a Muslim police officer who was actually killed in an accident, who was part of it.
[02:36:41.478 --> 02:36:50.741]  We've seen, in this South Yorkshire area, I organised a demonstration to come and talk about these issues, but at the time these issues were not exposed.
[02:36:51.528 --> 02:37:10.622]  And the police, as a result of that, arrested me at the airport, raided my wife's house with machine guns, raided my mum and dad's house, put me on false charges that meant I couldn't associate with the organisation I'd formed, my bail conditions made sure I couldn't enter their entire area.
[02:37:11.242 --> 02:37:15.005]  So they prevented me from holding a demonstration, they prevented me from talking about these issues.
[02:37:15.846 --> 02:37:20.849]  Um, once the date had gone past of our demonstration, they just dropped all the charges.
[02:37:21.310 --> 02:37:37.980]  I actually have it from 10 years ago, in black and white writing, from an independent police investigation, where I put in a complaint that the police accepted what they'd done was politically motivated, they accepted the reason they'd done it was to silence me, and they sent their police officers on training courses.
[02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:40.282]  Now... So you were politically persecuted.
[02:37:40.322 --> 02:37:44.885]  Fast forward to your year in prison, your three months, and now what you're facing, because you may be thrown back in.
[02:37:45.851 --> 02:37:50.113]  Yeah, fast forward to, so that has been a common theme over 10 years.
[02:37:50.133 --> 02:37:56.675]  If we get to the most recent case, the most recent case, I went to the city of Leeds.
[02:37:57.695 --> 02:38:02.777]  In fact, I still have to be careful now because there's still condition on this case.
[02:38:03.177 --> 02:38:10.000]  Basically, when I went there, there's a court trial going on involving 31 people.
[02:38:10.740 --> 02:38:10.940]  Now,
[02:38:12.521 --> 02:38:19.983]  All the information I'm about to tell you now, which is the whole reason why I'm still arguing my innocence, all this information is in the public domain.
[02:38:20.583 --> 02:38:28.425]  Now when you read the law, the law clearly states a judge has no power to put reporting restrictions on any information that's already in the public domain.
[02:38:29.106 --> 02:38:34.327]  Now what we've witnessed on the last six or seven big Muslim rape trials,
[02:38:35.194 --> 02:38:39.538]  That these reporting restrictions are put in place at the very start.
[02:38:40.078 --> 02:38:44.762]  And they state that there can be no reporting on this case whatsoever.
[02:38:45.622 --> 02:38:46.523]  Okay?
[02:38:46.543 --> 02:38:58.232]  So then, if there was reporting, then you'd be getting the details each day of what the men said to the girls, the comments they made, and the horrific abuse that these children have suffered.
[02:38:58.993 --> 02:39:02.456]  Including, even Mainstream News admits, a lot of dead girls.
[02:39:03.871 --> 02:39:05.752]  Yeah, plenty of dead girls.
[02:39:05.772 --> 02:39:07.754]  Plenty of dead girls.
[02:39:07.794 --> 02:39:09.575]  Plenty of girls who have never been found.
[02:39:10.035 --> 02:39:11.416]  Their bodies have just never been found.
[02:39:11.796 --> 02:39:17.880]  Let's be clear, we're hearing about Brett Kavanaugh, with no witnesses, 36 years ago, jumping on a girl at a party.
[02:39:18.681 --> 02:39:24.164]  And the same scumbag leftist media here covers up all the crap going on here against women.
[02:39:24.404 --> 02:39:26.206]  And again, I'm sick of people claiming they care about women.
[02:39:26.226 --> 02:39:27.126]  I have a wife.
[02:39:27.146 --> 02:39:27.867]  I have three daughters.
[02:39:28.527 --> 02:39:37.375]  I particularly care about women as an instinctive level and it enrages me to watch the left and their obsession with abusing women and defending radical Islam.
[02:39:38.997 --> 02:39:49.947]  And their obsession with the Me Too movement when I hear so many comments about someone said something sexist or massive deals made out of the fact that someone made a comment.
[02:39:50.498 --> 02:40:01.664]  And I think we've got children dying, children missing, being raped by their thousands in every single town and city, and you're silent.
[02:40:02.144 --> 02:40:05.266]  And you're not just silent, but you actually go out of your way.
[02:40:05.566 --> 02:40:10.348]  Journalists in this country, not one of them have challenged these reporting restrictions.
[02:40:10.949 --> 02:40:17.212]  So these restrictions are put in place so you can have a trial that lasts two months and you will not hear anything.
[02:40:17.870 --> 02:40:23.689]  And then when the trial finishes, they'll lift the reporting restriction and you'll get one day of news.
[02:40:24.803 --> 02:40:26.904]  30 men have been convicted for raping young girls.
[02:40:27.364 --> 02:40:27.805]  That's it!
[02:40:28.345 --> 02:40:30.126]  You won't hear the details.
[02:40:30.466 --> 02:40:32.867]  You won't hear the ins and outs.
[02:40:32.887 --> 02:40:38.810]  Why does the left cover up for Islam from Sweden to England to the US and the mass raping and killing of women?
[02:40:39.370 --> 02:40:43.892]  The whole thing of radical Islam and its orthodoxy is enslaving women and they're subhuman.
[02:40:43.912 --> 02:40:44.472]  That's a fact.
[02:40:44.633 --> 02:40:49.595]  Why is the left in love with the true satanic patriarchy?
[02:40:51.809 --> 02:41:04.641]  Many of the time, as we've heard from the previous journalists, who knew this was happening, Andrew Norfolk, he only acted when he saw the far right or the working class were making an issue out of it.
[02:41:04.661 --> 02:41:13.310]  I think many journalists despise us that much, despise the working class that much, despise their own country that much.
[02:41:13.985 --> 02:41:18.648]  And it depends, it depends what newspapers you look into, for where the money comes from.
[02:41:19.108 --> 02:41:23.051]  If you look at the Daily Mirror, we see the Saudi influence... Sure, it's a sick form of cuckolding.
[02:41:23.091 --> 02:41:23.751]  It's like funny.
[02:41:24.011 --> 02:41:26.773]  The working class are getting their daughters sold into slavery by the Muslims.
[02:41:28.238 --> 02:41:36.785]  Well they're certainly not, what they actually do then is they run stories about how people are racist or extremist when they march over it.
[02:41:36.826 --> 02:41:39.508]  But now it's all come up, so let me ask you this.
[02:41:40.028 --> 02:41:41.710]  Now that it's all coming out, what are they going to do?
[02:41:41.730 --> 02:41:42.711]  Because they're on their heels.
[02:41:42.951 --> 02:41:44.032]  They want to kill you, my friend.
[02:41:44.432 --> 02:41:45.012]  You've got to stay alive.
[02:41:45.032 --> 02:41:47.775]  We'll talk about what happened to you in prison when we come back, but let me ask you this.
[02:41:51.403 --> 02:41:52.083]  What are they going to do?
[02:41:52.103 --> 02:41:54.264]  Because it does seem like they're more and more on their heels.
[02:41:54.684 --> 02:41:56.605]  Nationalists are getting voted in everywhere in Europe.
[02:41:57.085 --> 02:42:00.687]  Common sense, life force, self-preservation is coming back.
[02:42:02.088 --> 02:42:07.870]  Well, I said this, we had a day for freedom demonstration two months before I was arrested.
[02:42:08.370 --> 02:42:11.272]  And I asked that question, what are they going to do?
[02:42:11.752 --> 02:42:15.133]  Because I sit there now thinking, what are they going to do next?
[02:42:15.253 --> 02:42:16.734]  Because essentially,
[02:42:18.070 --> 02:42:19.472]  I think I'm in the winning seat.
[02:42:19.872 --> 02:42:27.583]  And I've said that because everything I've tried to do for 10 years, and I'd be willing to sacrifice my life to bring the change that's needed.
[02:42:28.402 --> 02:42:43.189]  Now, I think their intention has been many times to let me be killed or have me be killed, because that's... But now if that happens, after seeing the world's response and the response in Britain and across the globe to my... Hold on, we've got to go to break.
[02:42:43.209 --> 02:42:43.729]  It's a hard break.
[02:42:43.789 --> 02:42:44.349]  I'm sorry to interrupt you.
[02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:47.030]  Come back with the incredible answer about a cliffhanger.
[02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:48.031]  This isn't Netflix.
[02:42:48.351 --> 02:42:49.051]  It isn't movies.
[02:42:49.111 --> 02:42:50.012]  This is a real hero.
[02:42:50.272 --> 02:42:51.432]  This is a guy they've tried to kill.
[02:42:51.452 --> 02:42:52.973]  This is a guy tortured in prison repeatedly.
[02:42:53.213 --> 02:42:54.293]  This is a guy that lost his house.
[02:42:54.533 --> 02:42:56.014]  His wife and children facing acid attack.
[02:42:56.294 --> 02:42:57.695]  This is a real man right here.

[02:44:02.301 --> 02:44:07.748]  Leo Zegami is somebody who has broken hundreds of stories years before they come out.
[02:44:07.888 --> 02:44:15.157]  He's got the exclusive at leozegami.com that Alexander Soros, now taking the mantle over from his father, forms shadow government with Obama.
[02:44:15.277 --> 02:44:18.161]  Leo Zegami, obviously this is critical information.
[02:44:18.241 --> 02:44:20.844]  People need to listen very, very, very carefully.
[02:44:21.044 --> 02:44:35.794]  The National Democratic Redistricting Committee has been shaped by the Soros as a new toy for the political relaunch of Obama and Michelle Obama, so the Obamas.
[02:44:36.114 --> 02:44:39.256]  This motto they have is also quite meaningful.
[02:44:39.336 --> 02:44:42.158]  The political system is rigged.
[02:44:42.198 --> 02:44:43.299]  They have rigged it.
[02:44:43.539 --> 02:44:44.460]  Of course it's rigged.
[02:44:44.900 --> 02:44:46.241]  But by them, not by us.
[02:44:46.841 --> 02:44:48.402]  And instead they are throwing it back to us.
[02:44:48.422 --> 02:44:48.922]  I've noticed that.
[02:44:48.942 --> 02:44:50.944]  They're calling themselves the resistance.
[02:44:51.664 --> 02:44:58.028]  Everything we've said, they're now becoming that, then banning me to then step in as the body snatcher into the body.
[02:44:58.308 --> 02:44:59.689]  This is really ridiculous.
[02:44:59.789 --> 02:45:08.194]  I think that people should check out Alexander Soros as the new, really, puppet master of this new world order.
[02:45:08.234 --> 02:45:14.578]  Because he's arriving from an experience as chairman, of course, of the Open Society.
[02:45:15.218 --> 02:45:25.085]  And he's been also indicated this year in the famous World Economic Forum as one of the young global leaders of 2018.
[02:45:26.706 --> 02:45:30.789]  So he's the upcoming figure that will replace George Soros.
[02:45:30.849 --> 02:45:34.632]  This means, basically, that we're never going to get rid of Soros.
[02:45:35.012 --> 02:45:49.885]  Father, son, this family is going to continue pushing their new world order and their democratic, progressive, liberal ways, and of course in support of Pope Francis.
[02:45:50.026 --> 02:45:55.971]  The words that were published on Twitter on the 22nd of September by Alexander Soros are very revealing.
[02:45:56.131 --> 02:46:01.316]  He says, it was great to welcome President Barack Obama back into my home.
[02:46:02.176 --> 02:46:06.758]  ...this week and introduce him on behalf of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee.
[02:46:07.358 --> 02:46:08.779]  He says, my home!
[02:46:08.999 --> 02:46:09.839]  So what is his home?
[02:46:09.879 --> 02:46:10.719]  The Democratic Party?
[02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:14.261]  Is the Democratic Party the party of George Soros, Alexander Soros?
[02:46:14.881 --> 02:46:17.862]  Or is the party of the United States of America?
[02:46:17.902 --> 02:46:26.646]  So this is really revealing to the people, once and for all, who is really, who are the puppet masters here, who are pulling the strings.
[02:46:26.986 --> 02:46:31.750]  We got documents earlier this year in January that Alexander Soros was funding.
[02:46:31.770 --> 02:46:32.951]  Anybody can type this in.
[02:46:33.111 --> 02:46:39.396]  Leaked documents show Obama was planning martial law in Maryland in 2015 is the headline.
[02:46:39.736 --> 02:46:42.378]  And it's all their own documents, how they fund Antifa, how they do it.
[02:46:42.758 --> 02:46:47.082]  Antifa is allowed to dox people, threaten to kill people, harass people in restaurants.
[02:46:47.162 --> 02:46:48.123]  Twitter won't take them down.
[02:46:48.603 --> 02:46:52.126]  I confront a CNN reporter who's having me censored, I get banned on Twitter.
[02:46:52.166 --> 02:46:55.989]  So it shows the power of Antifa because Alexander Soros funds it.
[02:47:03.530 --> 02:47:07.733]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.459 --> 02:47:16.780]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:17.081 --> 02:47:22.265]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:47:45.046 --> 02:47:54.893]  Imagine a Hollywood movie where a guy 12 years ago is running a tanning salon in a little town in England and sees 10, 12, 13-year-old girls crying for mommy being put in cars.
[02:47:54.933 --> 02:47:58.175]  And then he talks to the fathers and mothers and they go, yeah, the police won't help us.
[02:47:58.695 --> 02:48:00.356]  Our daughters are sold to sex slavery.
[02:48:01.237 --> 02:48:06.160]  And then it comes out 9, 10 years after he talks about it, it's happening in every town.
[02:48:07.001 --> 02:48:08.782]  And in many areas, the police are involved.
[02:48:10.732 --> 02:48:12.473]  And it's just incredible.
[02:48:12.533 --> 02:48:16.754]  So now he's been put in prison for a year because he exposed it.
[02:48:16.774 --> 02:48:17.694]  They tried to kill him there.
[02:48:17.714 --> 02:48:20.275]  Now he's put in three months, loses 30-something pounds.
[02:48:21.275 --> 02:48:36.320]  Recap what you've gone through and the fact that a Superior Court judge said, and you're the expert on English law, you've been through it, correct me if I'm wrong, said, okay, you were convicted in one hour of covering the pedophile gang, which again,
[02:48:37.375 --> 02:48:40.578]  And then, so they struck that down, but still it's got to be re-heard.
[02:48:40.598 --> 02:48:42.740]  I don't know how much you're allowed to say on air.
[02:48:42.760 --> 02:48:45.763]  You told me a lot of it yesterday in that hour-long conversation we had.
[02:48:46.103 --> 02:48:50.467]  So how much, because people really care about you and they want to know what's going on.
[02:48:50.487 --> 02:48:55.112]  So recap what happened to you the three months in, and then the latest info coming up next week.
[02:48:56.095 --> 02:49:00.798]  So I went for a judge in Leeds where I was reported on this trial.
[02:49:00.818 --> 02:49:04.440]  I was not asked to plead guilty or not guilty.
[02:49:05.020 --> 02:49:07.222]  I was refused the opportunity to speak with my lawyers.
[02:49:07.882 --> 02:49:09.023]  The case was not adjourned.
[02:49:09.683 --> 02:49:14.686]  The judge didn't even tell me what I'd done or said that amounted to contempt.
[02:49:15.386 --> 02:49:16.547]  And he sentenced me to prison.
[02:49:17.444 --> 02:49:30.678]  And then, so it took them a matter of hours to send me to prison, but then it took me two months to get back before a judge to put across our case to say this is not how the British legal system should work.
[02:49:32.039 --> 02:49:40.588]  Thankfully, the highest court in the land, the Court of Appeal, agreed and they gave a scathing attack, a scathing
[02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:45.442]  Report against the judge, where they said my sentence was unlawful.
[02:49:45.702 --> 02:49:47.182]  Everything about it was unlawful.
[02:49:47.863 --> 02:49:53.745]  Five major points were unlawful, but the point is, they didn't have to retry me.
[02:49:53.945 --> 02:50:03.049]  There's another case of a gentleman called West, where one thing, and one of the illegalities that the judge done on my case, he done five on my case.
[02:50:03.469 --> 02:50:10.152]  There was one illegal thing done in a gentleman called West's case, and his conviction was quashed, and there was no retrial.
[02:50:11.215 --> 02:50:15.139]  They've decided to retry me at the Old Bailey.
[02:50:15.199 --> 02:50:31.797]  Next Thursday I go to court at the Old Bailey in London, the most senior court of our land, the court that deals with terrorism, high-profile murders, and I'm in court for talking on my iPhone about Muslim men who are raping children.
[02:50:32.515 --> 02:50:33.797]  That's why I'm in court.
[02:50:34.198 --> 02:50:35.600]  The court case had finished.
[02:50:36.281 --> 02:50:38.945]  I wasn't prejudiced in a trial because... And let's be clear.
[02:50:39.125 --> 02:50:41.329]  Other news covered what you said and showed it.
[02:50:41.429 --> 02:50:42.310]  They didn't get in trouble.
[02:50:42.671 --> 02:50:45.375]  You were being persecuted because you are a world leader.
[02:50:46.602 --> 02:50:48.663]  Everything I said was in the public domain.
[02:50:48.983 --> 02:51:00.386]  In fact, if you look at what I said, the contempt charge, other journalists such as Rod Liddle have been stopped on contempt for breaching reporting restrictions.
[02:51:00.667 --> 02:51:02.347]  He got a £4,000 fine.
[02:51:02.787 --> 02:51:06.628]  I spoke to other journalists this week who collapsed the trial.
[02:51:06.648 --> 02:51:11.110]  There was 11 men on a murder trial and he collapsed the trial due to his reporting.
[02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:13.211]  And he didn't face any charges!
[02:51:13.271 --> 02:51:28.355]  No, we know you're being railroaded, so let's talk about what you're facing next week, and then what you're planning, because... Next week I face whether I walk into court, as I've been told, to apologize and plead guilty, so to meet the government halfway.
[02:51:28.735 --> 02:51:36.818]  To meet them midway, because at the minute it looks embarrassing for them, because they've been proven that they're persecuting me, they've been proven that their previous trial was unlawful and illegal.
[02:51:37.358 --> 02:51:40.619]  So it's whether I walk into court and do that, and then I get to go home,
[02:51:41.696 --> 02:51:45.818]  Or whether I walk in, which in fact I won't be doing anyway.
[02:51:46.599 --> 02:51:48.420]  I will walk into court with my head held up.
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:52.842]  And even if I walk out the front door there and then, my head's still held up.
[02:51:53.142 --> 02:51:58.925]  Or if I go to prison and I come out in a matter of months or however long, then I'll still walk out with my head held up.
[02:51:59.385 --> 02:52:07.630]  Because the only thing I take that I'm happy with about all this, obviously I'm concerned and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried.
[02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:09.311]  I don't want to go back to prison.
[02:52:09.811 --> 02:52:13.572]  It has an adverse effect on my whole family, not just me.
[02:52:13.592 --> 02:52:14.833]  So let's be clear.
[02:52:14.873 --> 02:52:19.215]  Tommy Robinson jailed for exposing pedophile rings and being a hero and being proven right because he's dangerous.
[02:52:20.117 --> 02:52:21.177]  What makes you tick?
[02:52:21.257 --> 02:52:21.938]  I mean, I know me.
[02:52:21.998 --> 02:52:24.739]  I'm not looking to be put in prison or killed or attacked or boycotted.
[02:52:25.159 --> 02:52:26.179]  But I know I'm right.
[02:52:26.940 --> 02:52:28.960]  And so when they attack me, it has the opposite.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:30.041]  I can be totally exhausted.
[02:52:30.381 --> 02:52:31.401]  And some bad news comes in.
[02:52:31.441 --> 02:52:33.262]  And so I have like five hours of incredible energy.
[02:52:33.882 --> 02:52:38.924]  And it reminds me of growing up in Dallas, you know, when I was a nice, sweet little kid, like 10 years old, and bullies would beat me up.
[02:52:39.604 --> 02:52:41.645]  And I'd come home, my dad said, well, you need to fight harder.
[02:52:41.665 --> 02:52:42.365]  And I was like 11 or 12.
[02:52:42.525 --> 02:52:45.987]  I put one of the bullies in the hospital next time he hit it, and I ended up getting in trouble.
[02:52:46.427 --> 02:52:47.227]  My dad got me out of it.
[02:52:47.247 --> 02:52:48.067]  He said, it's OK, son.
[02:52:48.087 --> 02:52:48.708]  We don't start fights.
[02:52:48.728 --> 02:52:49.128]  We finish them.
[02:52:49.788 --> 02:52:59.114]  What makes you at a gut level have not just the courage but the will to go out and do this and that totally scares the enemy?
[02:53:00.467 --> 02:53:07.770]  I put a lot of things, if I ever begin to feel sorry for myself, I'll put things into perspective.
[02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:12.571]  I just spent two and a half months in prison, on solitary confinement, away from my children.
[02:53:12.591 --> 02:53:15.152]  So yes, that was not good.
[02:53:15.272 --> 02:53:16.453]  It hasn't been a good effect.
[02:53:16.913 --> 02:53:27.817]  But then I look at members of the British public who sign up for our armed forces, or the American armed forces, and they leave their children, they kiss them goodbye, and they go on six-month tours.
[02:53:29.069 --> 02:53:30.730]  So I just view everything.
[02:53:31.270 --> 02:53:32.171]  I may have been in jail.
[02:53:32.211 --> 02:53:33.171]  It may have been terrible.
[02:53:33.631 --> 02:53:35.372]  There wasn't bullets passing my head every day.
[02:53:35.392 --> 02:53:35.832]  No, you said it.
[02:53:35.872 --> 02:53:36.232]  That's it.
[02:53:36.273 --> 02:53:38.073]  This is a war for our own homelands.
[02:53:38.433 --> 02:53:40.534]  We are soldiers in the information war.
[02:53:40.895 --> 02:53:43.396]  And once we decide we're expendable, it doesn't mean we want to die.
[02:53:43.476 --> 02:53:44.016]  We love life.
[02:53:44.296 --> 02:53:46.217]  But we have to decide we are expendable.
[02:53:46.497 --> 02:53:51.059]  And I think once you cross that road, many years ago, was it not empowering?
[02:53:51.339 --> 02:53:54.421]  When you made the decision, I'm going to go on to the end, whatever the cost is.
[02:53:55.768 --> 02:53:56.449]  It was empowering.
[02:53:57.930 --> 02:53:58.770]  I don't fear that.
[02:53:59.171 --> 02:53:59.891]  I don't fear that.
[02:54:00.312 --> 02:54:01.553]  And that's the truth.
[02:54:01.653 --> 02:54:04.115]  I generally don't fear that because I've accepted that.
[02:54:04.555 --> 02:54:16.084]  I've accepted that the inevitable outcome of this path, which I've chosen, I wrote a letter to my wife when I was in prison explaining all of this to say that I'm not in this position through anything other than choice.
[02:54:16.685 --> 02:54:18.506]  I know what I'm doing.
[02:54:18.586 --> 02:54:19.747]  I'm not a victim.
[02:54:19.987 --> 02:54:20.628]  I'm a target.
[02:54:21.792 --> 02:54:30.855]  Yeah, I'm not their victim, I'm their target, and I'm not gonna wallow in self-pity about a situation that is nothing in comparison to what many other people go through.
[02:54:30.895 --> 02:54:31.835]  Well, these little girls!
[02:54:32.035 --> 02:54:34.596]  I mean, any time I, in the middle of the night, wake up and go, what are you doing?
[02:54:34.956 --> 02:54:39.417]  I think about how the globalists are pedophiles, and how they hurt children, and God's just saying, do it!
[02:54:39.677 --> 02:54:40.517]  You claim you love me?
[02:54:40.858 --> 02:54:41.938]  Execute this operation!
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:49.225]  Yeah, and the other thing, the other judgment to make all the time is, are we morally right?
[02:54:49.485 --> 02:54:52.307]  And if I'm morally right, I'll do anything.
[02:54:53.128 --> 02:55:01.754]  I will go anywhere and I will not face or care about the consequences of the problems I'm talking about, if I'm morally right.
[02:55:02.075 --> 02:55:03.716]  And once you go past that,
[02:55:04.615 --> 02:55:16.958]  As a moral compass, what we're doing is trying to save the future of our culture, our children, our country, our history, a thousand years of history in this land that I'm sitting in, and thousands of men.
[02:55:17.178 --> 02:55:27.260]  If all I have to do for five minutes is see and think about the previous generations of what they gave and what they sacrificed, and to be honest, even what I'm doing
[02:55:27.680 --> 02:55:28.440]  It's nothing!
[02:55:28.660 --> 02:55:29.621]  Or what I've been through.
[02:55:29.921 --> 02:55:30.641]  It's nothing!
[02:55:31.081 --> 02:55:39.904]  We are a generation of cowards, born in an era where, and I also take huge satisfaction that so many people have been brought off of the fence.
[02:55:40.264 --> 02:55:41.265]  They've watched what happened.
[02:55:41.285 --> 02:55:51.168]  This last arrest, I'd like to say a thank you to Judge Marson, who put me in prison, because he has red-pilled more people than anyone I've ever met.
[02:55:51.852 --> 02:55:54.374]  He's been the most successful in bringing people to our courts.
[02:55:54.995 --> 02:55:57.436]  So that's all I base it on, Alex.
[02:55:57.456 --> 02:55:59.498]  I'm sure with yourself, we're right.
[02:55:59.798 --> 02:56:00.639]  We're telling the truth.
[02:56:01.439 --> 02:56:02.961]  It's a moral battle.
[02:56:03.061 --> 02:56:04.682]  It's a battle that we can't afford to lose.
[02:56:04.702 --> 02:56:09.906]  And the consequences are really nothing in comparison to what may
[02:56:10.066 --> 02:56:11.388]  And now we need intelligence.
[02:56:11.428 --> 02:56:15.091]  We need to think our steps out because you're a major general in this fight.
[02:56:15.112 --> 02:56:17.334]  We're going to break two minutes, five more minutes, and we'll get back to your family.
[02:56:17.634 --> 02:56:18.395]  TommyRobinson.online.
[02:56:18.415 --> 02:56:19.776]  People need to support him.
[02:56:20.297 --> 02:56:21.418]  He's trying to develop a plan.
[02:56:21.438 --> 02:56:25.843]  We're trying to work with other folks to set up something so that he can really get out there and be protected when he does it.
[02:56:26.223 --> 02:56:27.324]  And we'll be right back after break.
[02:56:27.565 --> 02:56:29.887]  I've got to plug, or I can't finance this whole operation.
[02:56:30.928 --> 02:56:32.108]  I can't finance any of it.
[02:56:32.969 --> 02:56:33.849]  We have great products.
[02:56:33.869 --> 02:56:34.769]  We have great supplements.
[02:56:34.789 --> 02:56:35.790]  We have a lot of great things.
[02:56:36.290 --> 02:56:38.831]  We're coming back in the final five minutes with Tommy Robinson.
[02:56:39.131 --> 02:56:41.212]  And Paul Watson, also from London, is going to be back.
[02:56:41.232 --> 02:56:42.292]  So Tommy, stay there five minutes.
[02:56:42.732 --> 02:56:43.472]  We'll be back in two minutes.
[02:56:43.512 --> 02:56:48.154]  Survival Shield X2 is the best deep earth crystal source iodine.
[02:56:48.234 --> 02:56:49.314]  It's the good halogen.
[02:56:50.275 --> 02:56:50.795]  You learn about
[02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:59.218]  The Iodine Conspiracy and how they have all these... Alright folks, I aired that from a week ago because he had his hearing.
[02:56:59.738 --> 02:57:01.600]  Tens of thousands of people showed up.
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:02.762]  It was incredible footage.
[02:57:03.423 --> 02:57:07.227]  And then the judge punted until the 23rd of October.
[02:57:12.981 --> 02:57:14.421]  Where he may be sent back to prison.
[02:57:14.441 --> 02:57:15.542]  He's just such a patriot.
[02:57:15.622 --> 02:57:16.982]  I wanted to re-air that today.
[02:57:17.442 --> 02:57:21.004]  We are going to have the exclusive interview that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:57:21.444 --> 02:57:26.205]  Some of the excerpts and the report that is the interview with the leader of the restart operation.
[02:57:26.245 --> 02:57:29.106]  It's the main opposition and a good group in Iran.
[02:57:29.146 --> 02:57:30.126]  That's going to be tomorrow.
[02:57:30.507 --> 02:57:31.147]  So look for that.
[02:57:31.227 --> 02:57:34.288]  Roger Stone's got huge breaking news coming up right now.
[02:57:35.008 --> 02:57:36.789]  Plus this at Infowars.com.
[02:57:36.809 --> 02:57:37.469]  It just broke.
[02:57:38.149 --> 02:57:46.067]  Report, Blasey Ford, best friend, who she reportedly helped learn how to do a lot of ticker tests, who later denied it, is also a career FBI agent.
[02:57:46.528 --> 02:57:48.552]  I mean, this is all people right out of the swamp.

[03:00:09.307 --> 03:00:15.252]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:18.297 --> 03:00:24.465]  Well, Roger Stone is taking over right now, but I've got to ride shotgun a little bit because wild horses can't drag me away.
[03:00:26.928 --> 03:00:30.793]  Christine Blasey Ford's grandfather, father...
[03:00:32.227 --> 03:00:37.312]  My brother, brother-in-law, were in some of the nastiest areas of the deep state CIA.
[03:00:37.653 --> 03:00:48.264]  Not the folks actually fighting in foreign lands, or battling communist China, or the Russians, or not people who actually do work, but the ruling class brain bug psychologist type.
[03:00:48.864 --> 03:00:49.785]  Psychiatrist type.
[03:00:50.666 --> 03:00:52.508]  And Pecheneg's one of those, but he was the top one.
[03:00:52.708 --> 03:00:54.109]  He was in combat, so he's a good guy.
[03:00:54.389 --> 03:00:58.892]  And he'll tell you how horrible the whole analyst, you know, cultural engineer crew is.
[03:00:59.313 --> 03:00:59.933]  They're the cancer.
[03:01:00.314 --> 03:01:02.615]  I want to be clear about different groups and intelligence agencies.
[03:01:03.256 --> 03:01:04.477]  These people are the worst.
[03:01:06.238 --> 03:01:12.483]  And then we learn, oh, the FBI agent that tested her, former agent, gave her two questions.
[03:01:13.584 --> 03:01:16.046]  Anybody can look up a standard FBI profile test.
[03:01:16.186 --> 03:01:20.349]  There's generally 20 to 50 warm-up questions to get a reading.
[03:01:22.725 --> 03:01:23.386]  Where do you live?
[03:01:23.426 --> 03:01:24.066]  Where are you born?
[03:01:24.086 --> 03:01:24.807]  Who are your parents?
[03:01:24.827 --> 03:01:25.427]  Who's your husband?
[03:01:25.467 --> 03:01:26.128]  Who's your wife?
[03:01:26.508 --> 03:01:27.089]  What do you do?
[03:01:27.129 --> 03:01:28.050]  What's your favorite color?
[03:01:28.970 --> 03:01:30.372]  She was given two questions, period.
[03:01:30.432 --> 03:01:31.713]  That's not a lie detector test.
[03:01:31.733 --> 03:01:35.976]  It's like saying going to college one day is not a bachelor's degree.
[03:01:36.637 --> 03:01:38.418]  Going to college a month is not a master's.
[03:01:41.381 --> 03:01:47.906]  So, then her friend came out, was all over the news this morning, and said, oh, oh no, she never coached me on
[03:01:49.195 --> 03:01:58.980]  Polygraph, like her old boyfriend said, who said she flew all over the world and was lying about being scared of open spaces or planes, which in her own accounts, she admits she traveled the whole world.
[03:01:59.040 --> 03:02:01.201]  She admitted that to Congress, but she can't fly to D.C.
[03:02:01.661 --> 03:02:03.362]  And none of the witnesses said they saw what they saw.
[03:02:04.583 --> 03:02:05.803]  She said that's because they're sick.
[03:02:06.204 --> 03:02:07.304]  It's okay, they're sick.
[03:02:10.146 --> 03:02:11.106]  Talk about projection.
[03:02:12.127 --> 03:02:18.370]  So Christine Ford's friend denies being helped on Polygraph fires back at news claims, but nowhere in AP or Fox
[03:02:19.209 --> 03:02:20.089]  Does it tell you this?
[03:02:22.151 --> 03:02:22.591]  Report!
[03:02:22.651 --> 03:02:25.572]  Blasey Ford's best friend, also career FBI agent.
[03:02:26.353 --> 03:02:30.955]  Oh, you might want to mention that, and a Democrat, and all the rest of it.
[03:02:30.995 --> 03:02:33.237]  Jamie White, InfoWars.com.
[03:02:37.319 --> 03:02:37.479]  So.
[03:02:39.651 --> 03:02:43.013]  It just gets more and more ridiculous from here on out, doesn't it?
[03:02:43.473 --> 03:02:51.958]  In a letter released from Christine Blasey, Ford's ex-boyfriend, it was revealed that Ford helped lifelong friend Monica L. McLean pass a polygraph test.
[03:02:53.519 --> 03:02:55.600]  But who exactly is Monica McLean?
[03:02:57.382 --> 03:02:58.862]  Well, she's the owner of the McRib.
[03:02:58.882 --> 03:02:59.103]  No.
[03:02:59.283 --> 03:03:04.165]  In addition to being Ford's best friend, McLean also is a 24-year employee of the Department of Justice and FBI.
[03:03:05.384 --> 03:03:08.349]  From 92 to 2006, according to her LinkedIn profile.
[03:03:08.669 --> 03:03:10.973]  But none of the media wanted to point that out, did they?
[03:03:11.333 --> 03:03:11.574]  No.
[03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:17.651]  And of course her lawyer, Ford's lawyer, is the top swamp lawyer for McCabe and others.
[03:03:17.991 --> 03:03:25.433]  The ex-boyfriend describes Ford's relationship with McLean in a letter obtained by Fox News, telling how she helped McLean pass the polygraph test, which they make the FBI do all the time.
[03:03:25.973 --> 03:03:28.353]  Wonder why he'd know that if the story wasn't true.
[03:03:29.213 --> 03:03:30.894]  Wonder why he'd even have something like that.
[03:03:31.394 --> 03:03:32.554]  Of course he's telling the truth.
[03:03:33.234 --> 03:03:34.254]  Who would come up with that?
[03:03:34.635 --> 03:03:36.455]  That she had a friend help pass the polygraph.
[03:03:38.012 --> 03:03:45.734]  During some of the time we were dating, Dr. Ford lived with Monica McLean, who I understand to be her lifelong best friend.
[03:03:45.994 --> 03:03:53.717]  During that time, it was my understanding that McLean was preparing, was interviewing for jobs at the FBI and the U.S.
[03:03:53.857 --> 03:03:54.737]  Attorney's Office.
[03:03:55.555 --> 03:03:56.896]  Which is now confirmed.
[03:03:57.677 --> 03:04:03.601]  I witnessed Dr. Ford help McLean prepare for potential polygraph exam.
[03:04:03.981 --> 03:04:11.347]  Dr. Ford explained in detail what to expect, how polygraphs worked, and helped McLean become familiar with less nervous about the exam.
[03:04:11.407 --> 03:04:11.867]  Yeah, right.
[03:04:12.928 --> 03:04:17.051]  Dr. Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology.
[03:04:17.392 --> 03:04:18.773]  Very special background.
[03:04:20.214 --> 03:04:23.056]  Now you'd think her being a Democrat swamp creature
[03:04:24.278 --> 03:04:25.038]  Play into this.
[03:04:25.339 --> 03:04:28.420]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[03:04:32.062 --> 03:04:32.262]  Stop.
[03:04:33.658 --> 03:04:34.818]  It just gets more insane.
[03:04:35.619 --> 03:04:42.920]  And then, meanwhile, there's the article on Infowars.com of Tim Cook of Apple, who runs the big slave factories in China, but it's okay, he's gay.
[03:04:43.481 --> 03:04:44.541]  As long as he's gay, it's okay.
[03:04:46.621 --> 03:04:49.582]  Bragging about how they censored me and just how I deserved it.
[03:04:49.662 --> 03:04:51.523]  You know, I just deserved it.
[03:04:51.543 --> 03:04:59.865]  Because, you know, everyone knows there's the body of evidence, like running slave factories, helping to expel the Chinese people, like you, a mass murderer, Tim Cook, by extension.
[03:05:01.192 --> 03:05:02.532]  Well, the moment of truth is here.
[03:05:02.892 --> 03:05:05.473]  George Soros now is taking control of PayPal and he's banned us.
[03:05:05.493 --> 03:05:10.014]  They're trying to shut down our final payment processors and end InfoWars.
[03:05:10.374 --> 03:05:11.114]  We've now reached this point.
[03:05:11.694 --> 03:05:15.014]  And listen, I knew fighting the globalists, there'd be a price to pay.
[03:05:15.234 --> 03:05:18.235]  And I did it because I knew what horrible individuals they were.
[03:05:18.755 --> 03:05:24.296]  And I was willing to sacrifice myself, my name, my treasure, on the altar of having a better future like our forebears did.
[03:05:24.856 --> 03:05:26.796]  But I don't want to go down without a real fight.
[03:05:27.577 --> 03:05:29.657]  Because I'm going to keep swinging until the end.
[03:05:30.851 --> 03:05:42.776]  But if you, the listeners, really awaken and financially support us like never before with the payment systems we have left at InfoWareStore.com, it is going to allow us to really hold the line like the Alamo.
[03:05:43.886 --> 03:05:45.627]  Until we either win or we're defeated.
[03:05:46.207 --> 03:05:57.893]  So in the words of the great founder of Texas, and that wasn't Houston, that was Colonel Travis, victory or death, we are going to win if you take action.
[03:05:58.154 --> 03:06:00.475]  We're going to win if you support us, but it's now all in your hands.
[03:06:12.535 --> 03:06:15.997]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:16.617 --> 03:06:22.340]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.881 --> 03:06:28.904]  Well, at this point, there's just too much news to even cover.
[03:06:30.385 --> 03:06:32.686]  I've been forced to file a lawsuit against PayPal.
[03:06:33.907 --> 03:06:35.948]  I have an 18-year relationship with them.
[03:06:37.698 --> 03:06:42.459]  And the reason I filed suit against them is to draw attention to what's happening.
[03:06:42.499 --> 03:06:47.601]  Whatever comes from it, their contract is toxic.
[03:06:48.501 --> 03:06:49.261]  You waive your rights.
[03:06:49.901 --> 03:06:55.042]  You shouldn't make sharecroppers waive all their rights for a chance to be employed by them.
[03:06:57.503 --> 03:07:03.244]  And, you know, they demonized me when they said I was a hate monger and an evil person when they banned me.
[03:07:03.785 --> 03:07:05.225]  So, you know, that's a form of defamation.
[03:07:06.773 --> 03:07:15.377]  And, you know, when you've got them working with third-world dictators, you've got them working with the Nation of Islam, you've got them working with Hezbollah, you've got them working with CAIR.
[03:07:15.797 --> 03:07:18.619]  And by the way, I'm not Louis Farrakhan's enemy.
[03:07:19.459 --> 03:07:28.683]  And a lot of what Farrakhan says is taken out of context, and I've interviewed Farrakhan, and at certain levels I think Farrakhan's said some things that are true, a lot of things I disagree with.
[03:07:28.964 --> 03:07:30.964]  So I'm not calling for Farrakhan to be kicked off PayPal.
[03:07:31.505 --> 03:07:31.865]  It's that
[03:07:34.119 --> 03:07:37.420]  Anybody that knows my show knows that I really like Martin Luther King.
[03:07:38.020 --> 03:07:40.221]  He was a great speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:07:41.321 --> 03:07:44.022]  And I really believe in what you stand for and what you do.
[03:07:44.742 --> 03:07:47.083]  If you're great at art, if you write a great book, I'm going to read your book.
[03:07:47.103 --> 03:07:48.624]  If you cook great food, I'm going to come to your restaurant.
[03:07:49.064 --> 03:07:50.644]  If you play great music, I'm going to go listen to you.
[03:07:52.065 --> 03:07:56.366]  I think there's women beautiful from every stripe of human, you know, community.
[03:07:57.827 --> 03:08:02.288]  And so that's where I stand.
[03:08:03.854 --> 03:08:09.665]  And I don't need to sit here and virtue-signal all day that I'm not a Nazi, but let me tell you something.
[03:08:09.705 --> 03:08:15.537]  They've called reporters that work here white nationalists because they covered Charlottesville.
[03:08:18.564 --> 03:08:29.808]  Charlottesville was led by a bunch of Democrat operatives, all of them, who a year before had worked for Hillary or Obama, and then all suddenly dressed up like Nazis, and they're all a bunch of... I mean, let's just say it.
[03:08:30.168 --> 03:08:43.152]  I'm not against them because they're gay, but they're a bunch of gay drama students and drama professors who, you know, wanted to burn torches and go make Trump look bad.
[03:08:43.959 --> 03:08:45.200]  I mean, that's what it was.
[03:08:45.220 --> 03:08:47.721]  It was just a gay drama club out there dressed up like Nazis.
[03:08:48.221 --> 03:08:50.041]  And there's been so many cases of that.
[03:08:50.482 --> 03:08:52.923]  And then reporters go cover it and you get called white supremacists.
[03:08:54.263 --> 03:08:59.105]  And listen, I don't like white supremacists, but I don't like black supremacists, hispanic supremacists, any of this.
[03:08:59.365 --> 03:09:06.148]  We've got videos on Infowars.com, I haven't even gotten to today, that the incredible Millie Weaver and the amazing Gavin Wentz have shot.
[03:09:09.158 --> 03:09:17.723]  Where there are Mexicans who are illegal aliens, they say they are, wearing Mexico soccer jerseys, saying F Trump, F America.
[03:09:18.663 --> 03:09:21.965]  There's a new video out, we need to bleep it, we should air it towards the end of this hour.
[03:09:22.545 --> 03:09:23.946]  Just insanity.
[03:09:25.529 --> 03:09:32.414]  And then there's a guy who lost his daughter when a drunk illegal alien hit her going 100 miles an hour head-on with three of his own kids in the car.
[03:09:32.454 --> 03:09:33.134]  They didn't die.
[03:09:33.534 --> 03:09:34.035]  She did.
[03:09:34.355 --> 03:09:38.998]  And this racist, in my view, Hispanic lady is saying, F off, gringo.
[03:09:42.560 --> 03:09:46.502]  So, yeah, if I was walking down the street and I saw KKK everywhere, I'd be concerned.
[03:09:46.942 --> 03:09:55.906]  I walk around and I see large groups of whites trained to hate being white and screaming white people need to have their balls chopped off and kill Kavanaugh and kill the Republicans.
[03:09:55.926 --> 03:09:57.006]  You know, that's major professors.
[03:09:57.246 --> 03:09:58.127]  They're not getting in trouble.
[03:09:58.347 --> 03:10:05.750]  When you talk about KKK-type crap, I'm seeing it from white professors and leftists radicalizing Hispanics and others.
[03:10:06.110 --> 03:10:10.272]  Where you show up in Tennessee at a Trump rally, maybe we should roll some of that as B-roll.
[03:10:11.530 --> 03:10:13.712]  Headline, father who lost daughter confronts illegals.
[03:10:15.013 --> 03:10:18.696]  And he just looks at him and says, I lost my daughter, and they get in his face.
[03:10:19.156 --> 03:10:21.618]  There's a guy from Argentina who's here legally.
[03:10:21.638 --> 03:10:23.199]  He's like, Jesus, just be here legally.
[03:10:25.241 --> 03:10:41.013]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, that's what we've gotten to in this country, where Alex Jones rails against big tech, bombshell PayPal bans InfoWars after lobbying by Soros-funded group, InfoWars files emergency injunction against PayPal and federal court,
[03:10:42.079 --> 03:10:43.860]  Really what I wanted to show was their headlines.
[03:10:44.620 --> 03:10:48.041]  Alex Jones says PayPal and InfoWars banned for hate and intolerance.
[03:10:48.081 --> 03:10:49.121]  This magic word.
[03:10:49.441 --> 03:10:52.682]  I think Tim Cook running Slave Factors in China is hating intolerance.
[03:10:52.922 --> 03:10:54.943]  I think them shutting down free speech is hating intolerance.
[03:10:55.343 --> 03:10:58.104]  But they just say these magic words and I'm blown out the airlock.
[03:11:01.505 --> 03:11:03.246]  So they're the clear and present danger.
[03:11:03.666 --> 03:11:05.286]  What are we going to do about it?
[03:11:05.446 --> 03:11:07.207]  There's another article on InfoWars.com.
[03:11:07.987 --> 03:11:08.547]  If you pull it up.
[03:11:10.008 --> 03:11:10.628]  That's the latest.
[03:11:12.625 --> 03:11:22.272]  With folks that are so brainwashed while they're inside this country and so trained to hate this nation that they don't even know what planet they're on.
[03:11:22.552 --> 03:11:34.020]  Oh, they want to get here as soon as they can, but they want to turn it into the third world nation that they came from.
[03:11:36.101 --> 03:11:37.162]  Why do they fear Infowars?
[03:11:38.643 --> 03:11:41.845]  Because we talk about real issues.
[03:11:44.107 --> 03:11:45.628]  Because we break down the real facts.
[03:11:45.648 --> 03:11:46.689]  I don't care how long it takes.
[03:11:46.709 --> 03:11:48.450]  I'm going to pull up the article on Infowars.com.
[03:11:51.212 --> 03:11:53.494]  I tell you, Fox Insider puts bugs on your phone, man.
[03:11:54.855 --> 03:11:58.157]  Once I went there, it just keeps launching all this crazy-ass stuff.
[03:11:58.177 --> 03:11:59.138]  I'll sit here for five hours.
[03:11:59.198 --> 03:11:59.578]  I have to.
[03:12:00.118 --> 03:12:02.460]  If you go to Infowars.com, I'm just going to sit here for hours.
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:10.506]  You go to Infowars.com, and you come there, and there's just a whole other article by Millie Weaver right there below the top stories and featured.
[03:12:10.806 --> 03:12:11.166]  There it is.
[03:12:11.546 --> 03:12:13.648]  Anti-Trump protesters declare Mexico first.
[03:12:14.636 --> 03:12:16.817]  And they've got Mexican flags hanging on them.
[03:12:17.357 --> 03:12:18.057]  All this stuff.
[03:12:18.097 --> 03:12:20.058]  This is crazy town.
[03:12:21.299 --> 03:12:24.000]  And that's where all our reporters should be is at the Trump rallies.
[03:12:24.800 --> 03:12:25.780]  That's where we should really be.
[03:12:25.820 --> 03:12:27.801]  That's where I should really be is just out there on the streets.
[03:12:28.981 --> 03:12:43.427]  And that's why they try to do everything they can to kill our live feeds on Facebook and Twitter and YouTube so that we can't communicate with you so you can't see what the globalists have set up and what the globalists have done and what they've developed and what they have set up in this nation to bring us down.
[03:12:45.444 --> 03:12:45.784]  That's it.
[03:12:48.966 --> 03:12:53.188]  So I'm gonna end this segment and let Roger Stone take over, but man, that's some powerful video.
[03:12:53.448 --> 03:12:55.249]  It might even make one of our shows today.
[03:12:56.049 --> 03:12:57.530]  It might even make it on the air today.
[03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:58.350]  Probably not, though.
[03:12:59.070 --> 03:13:04.613]  But... Millie Weaver's on fire, and I salute her, and I thank her, and I really, really appreciate her.
[03:13:06.263 --> 03:13:08.043]  So, Roger's coming up in just a moment.
[03:13:08.263 --> 03:13:10.824]  If you don't support us, you know, we're suing PayPal.
[03:13:10.844 --> 03:13:11.964]  That's going to be expensive.
[03:13:12.364 --> 03:13:13.344]  We're battling Soros.
[03:13:13.664 --> 03:13:14.364]  And I'm not bitching.
[03:13:14.404 --> 03:13:15.985]  Hell, I'm here to kick their ass politically.
[03:13:16.505 --> 03:13:23.466]  But you might want to bet on the horse and you might want to fund the operation that's 110% in as hard as I can.
[03:13:23.486 --> 03:13:24.626]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:13:24.646 --> 03:13:26.026]  A lot of people don't have memories anymore.
[03:13:26.046 --> 03:13:28.767]  A lot of people have already given up their brains to TV and culture.
[03:13:29.567 --> 03:13:33.328]  Whatever mesmerization thing they send through these damn phones doesn't work on me.
[03:13:33.568 --> 03:13:34.468]  It only pisses me off.
[03:13:37.068 --> 03:13:42.457]  I'm conscious, I'm aware, and I'm not going to let people that aid and abet mass murders like Tim Cook run my life.
[03:13:42.497 --> 03:13:47.084]  And I believe we will beat this, sorry SOB and the rest of them, as long as you take action.
[03:13:47.104 --> 03:13:49.248]  But I need your hopes, I need your prayers, and I need your support.
[03:13:50.578 --> 03:13:57.300]  Tomorrow is the last day, maybe even today, I don't know, I've got new specials coming out on Brain Force Plus, the great nootropic, 40% off.
[03:13:57.660 --> 03:13:59.861]  Secret 12, the amazing pure vitamin B12.
[03:14:00.301 --> 03:14:10.104]  Happy's, the new mood and stress relief system with a bunch of key concentrated herbs that are known to give you, not a depressant, but a smooth, calm, confident gait.
[03:14:10.184 --> 03:14:11.324]  I should probably drink a whole bottle of this.
[03:14:11.664 --> 03:14:12.824]  Actually, don't do that, folks.
[03:14:13.345 --> 03:14:14.245]  Take the recommended amount.
[03:14:14.285 --> 03:14:15.505]  Consult your physicians before you take it.
[03:14:16.126 --> 03:14:26.409]  It's a little tongue-in-cheek comment, and I'm pretty wound up with the energetic level 34 days out from this critical election, and just trying to get people out of the comas, out of the trances.
[03:14:26.429 --> 03:14:29.910]  Even people who think they're awake are in these trances with no memory.
[03:14:31.031 --> 03:14:36.052]  I witness it constantly, just no memory, even an hour before, and it's like a time warp, but it's okay.
[03:14:36.573 --> 03:14:40.234]  Those of us that have memory, it's a gift from God.
[03:14:41.124 --> 03:14:43.626]  Those of us that have consciousness, it's an amazing thing.
[03:14:43.686 --> 03:14:45.748]  So, please keep supporting the broadcast.
[03:14:46.008 --> 03:14:47.170]  Please keep getting the products.

[03:14:59.042 --> 03:15:05.284]  Things are definitely coming to a head, and Trump's going to have big meetings in the White House soon with the tech heads with a little light on his face.
[03:15:05.744 --> 03:15:10.106]  He'll give them an ultimatum, they'll crap all over him, and then he'll take them to the woodshed like he's done China.
[03:15:10.126 --> 03:15:11.026]  That's how Trump works.
[03:15:11.506 --> 03:15:22.830]  He's through a process of giving people a chance, and I know that Roger Stone's got a lot on that, a lot on Kavanaugh coming up for the next three segments straight ahead, and then you're going to have our great host, co-host with him in the War Room.
[03:15:23.752 --> 03:15:27.537]  Owen Schroer is so on fire coming up today in about 45 minutes.
[03:15:27.577 --> 03:15:31.201]  So we're going to go to break, but without you buying the products, we won't be here.
[03:15:31.522 --> 03:15:34.986]  You know, PayPal, now that we have an emergency injunction, may be good for a few more days.
[03:15:35.126 --> 03:15:35.547]  I don't know.
[03:15:36.568 --> 03:15:37.589]  But people say fight back.
[03:15:37.650 --> 03:15:38.551]  Well, I'm doing it, you know.
[03:15:38.971 --> 03:15:39.871]  People say, get rid of Hillary.
[03:15:39.931 --> 03:15:40.351]  I'm doing it.
[03:15:40.371 --> 03:15:41.592]  People say, Hillary for president?
[03:15:41.612 --> 03:15:42.492]  We're doing it!
[03:15:42.512 --> 03:15:44.473]  Of course, you know she'd come after me, right?
[03:15:44.693 --> 03:15:47.234]  Like, so we've done it now, so we need your support.
[03:15:47.594 --> 03:15:49.834]  Financially, particularly, and your prayers.
[03:15:50.474 --> 03:15:53.135]  So, belly up and double down and be part of history.
[03:15:53.575 --> 03:15:54.616]  MFortWorthStore.com.
[03:15:54.656 --> 03:15:55.796]  Buy your warm bonds today.
[03:16:00.397 --> 03:16:01.958]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[03:16:02.318 --> 03:16:08.440]  And I tell you all of it, I could literally keep you here all night because the stories are just so unbelievable.
[03:16:09.958 --> 03:16:11.819]  This is coming to a theater near you.
[03:16:17.300 --> 03:16:24.682]  The epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year.
[03:16:25.722 --> 03:16:30.923]  It's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences.
[03:16:31.163 --> 03:16:36.465]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counter-intel people I've talked to,
[03:16:37.345 --> 03:16:42.971]  Could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[03:16:43.572 --> 03:16:45.013]  Guided by Americans.
[03:16:45.213 --> 03:16:46.234]  Guided by Americans.
[03:16:46.795 --> 03:16:54.883]  And so voters who are being targeted with all of this false information are genuinely trying to make up their minds.
[03:16:55.224 --> 03:16:56.125]  What does it mean?
[03:16:56.645 --> 03:16:59.828]  It's a danger that must be addressed and addressed quickly.
[03:17:00.789 --> 03:17:12.476]  Bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news.
[03:17:12.676 --> 03:17:22.802]  There have been a series of studies, academic studies, since the election trying to figure out why people voted the way they did because it defied all the polls.
[03:17:22.983 --> 03:17:24.744]  Nobody was ready for it.
[03:17:25.444 --> 03:17:28.066]  And people relied on
[03:17:28.706 --> 03:17:33.932]  What they saw in the media, but even more so online.
[03:17:34.232 --> 03:17:44.603]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:17:45.063 --> 03:17:47.326]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[03:17:47.786 --> 03:17:50.108]  He actually went on Jones' show and said,
[03:17:51.090 --> 03:17:52.531]  Your reputation's amazing.
[03:17:53.011 --> 03:17:54.352]  I will not let you down.
[03:17:54.492 --> 03:17:57.393]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:17:57.413 --> 03:18:03.657]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[03:18:03.697 --> 03:18:15.503]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[03:18:15.683 --> 03:18:21.585]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[03:18:21.765 --> 03:18:25.686]  Social media giants acting this time before it's too late.
[03:18:26.246 --> 03:18:26.686]  Their goal?
[03:18:27.026 --> 03:18:30.848]  To prevent fake news and propaganda from influencing the upcoming U.S.
[03:18:30.888 --> 03:18:31.808]  midterm election.
[03:18:31.968 --> 03:18:34.729]  I'm glad that the Congress and others are looking
[03:18:35.649 --> 03:18:45.991]  At Facebook and Twitter and Google because they are the vehicles, one of the very first vehicles to deliver this kind of information to people.
[03:18:46.331 --> 03:18:48.512]  And then they began to weaponize them.
[03:18:48.672 --> 03:19:04.535]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like InfoWars, take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[03:19:04.815 --> 03:19:12.437]  If something popped up in a Facebook feed and looked like a news report, people were inclined to believe it.
[03:19:12.858 --> 03:19:23.841]  And if they were already targeted psychologically to be receptive to the information provided, they were influenceable.
[03:19:24.241 --> 03:19:26.783]  InfoWars comes to mind, where those are echo chambers.
[03:19:27.103 --> 03:19:30.085]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[03:19:30.326 --> 03:19:39.652]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and there are blocky conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[03:19:39.933 --> 03:19:49.720]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[03:20:04.088 --> 03:20:06.670]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.611 --> 03:20:31.196]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.656 --> 03:20:34.599]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:38.061 --> 03:20:40.583]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:40.823 --> 03:20:47.928]  I'm Roger Stone, and not even technological difficulties can stop us from bringing you the real news.
[03:20:48.589 --> 03:20:49.830]  I'm in Washington, D.C.
[03:20:49.870 --> 03:20:52.532]  today for a series of meetings to talk about
[03:20:53.472 --> 03:21:04.600]  Grassroots activism, supporting the President's Supreme Court nominee, and also to begin planning to thwart what is clearly coming down the pike.
[03:21:05.140 --> 03:21:15.447]  Quite simply, if Brett Kavanaugh is rejected by the Senate, you have seen the dress rehearsal for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
[03:21:16.007 --> 03:21:20.070]  You have seen the two-party duopoly's dry run.
[03:21:20.706 --> 03:21:21.686]  Here's how it works.
[03:21:22.507 --> 03:21:35.852]  If the Democrats win the House this November, a few short days from now, as soon as they take control in January, they will surely vote articles of impeachment against Donald Trump.
[03:21:36.896 --> 03:21:52.474]  Because they are empty-handed on the question of Russian collusion, that is, Russian coordination, collusion, conspiracy with the Trump campaign, their new excuse will be sexual assault by Donald Trump.
[03:21:53.528 --> 03:22:13.605]  As with Judge Kavanaugh, there is of course no evidence or proof of that, but there are a number of women who surfaced briefly in the 2016 campaign with these accusations, none of whom had any corroboration, any evidence, any proof that what they were saying was true.
[03:22:14.521 --> 03:22:18.363]  They quickly disappeared, but believe me, folks, they'll be back.
[03:22:18.864 --> 03:22:20.765]  And now there's a new standard.
[03:22:20.845 --> 03:22:24.687]  The standard is guilty until proven innocent.
[03:22:25.227 --> 03:22:28.469]  There will be a hysteria created in the country.
[03:22:28.850 --> 03:22:35.974]  The president will be accused by weeping women in the Senate trial, all of which, of course, will be televised.
[03:22:37.054 --> 03:22:44.218]  And the President's weak-kneed Republican supporters will head for the exits.
[03:22:44.358 --> 03:22:46.499]  They will vote with the Democrats.
[03:22:47.079 --> 03:22:52.181]  We need to move aggressively, but first let's examine why this is happening.
[03:22:54.122 --> 03:22:59.845]  The last few days have been revealing, between Bob Woodward's book,
[03:23:00.484 --> 03:23:14.156]  The anonymous op-ed and Obama's speech, you have evidence that the deep state is preparing for the same exact type of takedown that they used to remove President John F. Kennedy.
[03:23:14.757 --> 03:23:18.380]  In his case, their game plan was somewhat more violent.
[03:23:18.960 --> 03:23:21.563]  You see, much like President Kennedy,
[03:23:22.361 --> 03:23:24.625]  Donald Trump is for peace.
[03:23:25.186 --> 03:23:28.593]  He wants to lessen tensions with North Korea.
[03:23:29.054 --> 03:23:32.320]  He wants to lessen tensions with the Russians.
[03:23:33.392 --> 03:23:58.972]  After the Bay of Pigs fiasco, when President John Kennedy refused to mount an all-out assault against Cuba, and after the Cuban Missile Crisis, in which JFK signaled that he wanted talks with Russia to lessen national prospects for a nuclear holocaust, well, it was too much for the deep state, and they took him down.
[03:23:59.873 --> 03:24:24.152]  Prior to these more recent signals, the Washington Post phony anonymous op-ed, the Bob Woodward book, and Obama's incredible speech in which he grabbed credit for a surging economy that he predicted would never surge again, the evidence was somewhat thinner but still more troubling.
[03:24:24.989 --> 03:24:36.521]  First of all, you had a series of anonymous leaks out of Obama's intelligence services regarding the alleged collusion with the Russians.
[03:24:37.242 --> 03:24:42.368]  One of these was even admitted to under oath by FBI Director James Comey.
[03:24:43.228 --> 03:24:59.721]  Then you had a series of anti-Trump political messages that were found in the text of changes between Peter Stroke and other FBI agents regarding the fact that they could find no real evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:25:00.141 --> 03:25:04.205]  There was, as Lisa Page said, no there there.
[03:25:05.366 --> 03:25:09.609]  And then the Democratic Party produced a dossier.
[03:25:10.405 --> 03:25:27.681]  Not a document created by law enforcement or legitimate intelligence agencies, but a partisan document that was then used as the legal rationale for the surveillance of the Republican candidate for president.
[03:25:28.822 --> 03:25:33.446]  An abuse of power that makes Watergate look like small potatoes.
[03:25:34.131 --> 03:25:50.787]  And then lastly, very similar to Watergate, a former CIA and FBI operative approached members of the Trump campaign in an effort to plant faux evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:25:51.784 --> 03:25:54.485]  These are the seeds of sedition.
[03:25:55.085 --> 03:26:03.468]  These are the underlying aspects of the game in play to remove our president.
[03:26:04.028 --> 03:26:11.330]  Now, there are two things that the deep state requires before they can make their move on Donald Trump.
[03:26:12.170 --> 03:26:17.212]  First and foremost is the complete silencing of InfoWars.com.
[03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:22.891]  They want Alex Jones shut up and as quickly as possible.
[03:26:23.391 --> 03:26:41.274]  Because they know that millions of Americans tune into InfoWars through whatever app or whatever platform they choose to get the truth, the raw, I like to call it, stone cold truth about what's happening in Washington and what the globalists are really up to.
[03:26:41.854 --> 03:26:45.855]  Then, as I have said here many times, they would like to lock me up.
[03:26:46.633 --> 03:26:47.234]  Thank you.
[03:27:08.621 --> 03:27:09.922]  Don't let them do it, folks.
[03:27:09.982 --> 03:27:15.485]  Go to the InfoWars.com site right now, because we need your help as never before.
[03:27:16.125 --> 03:27:18.606]  InfoWars is a beacon of freedom.
[03:27:19.087 --> 03:27:20.988]  We are Freedom Command Central.
[03:27:21.368 --> 03:27:29.072]  This is where you will hear up-to-the-minute reports on exactly what the deep state is up to in their efforts to take down our president.
[03:27:29.552 --> 03:27:36.996]  We will tell you when and how to act with grassroots activism to counter the efforts of the left.
[03:27:37.722 --> 03:27:47.333]  But we cannot do it without your support, and we cannot do it while we are facing the kind of censorship that they hope to put on us.
[03:27:48.053 --> 03:27:50.756]  We are really not crying wolf.
[03:27:51.377 --> 03:27:56.963]  We are operating under, as you can see, some technological restraints.
[03:27:57.604 --> 03:27:58.585]  But we do know this.
[03:27:59.588 --> 03:28:01.890]  Shutting down Infowars is crucial.
[03:28:02.450 --> 03:28:04.071]  Tim Cook is lying.
[03:28:04.631 --> 03:28:19.320]  It is only through the process of discovery and lawsuits that we're going to be able to prove that the Apple CEO lies through his teeth when he says there is no coordination.
[03:28:19.700 --> 03:28:24.583]  There's never been any discussions regarding the censorship of Alex Jones.
[03:28:25.064 --> 03:28:28.526]  He lies, and only in a court of law will we prove it.
[03:28:29.185 --> 03:28:33.668]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and I'll be right back.
[03:29:04.537 --> 03:29:06.458]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:30:02.318 --> 03:30:09.663]  This Congress has championed the unwinding of campaign finance laws to give billionaires outside influence over our politics.
[03:30:11.264 --> 03:30:16.147]  Systematically attacked voting rights to make it harder for young people and minorities and the poor to vote.
[03:30:19.149 --> 03:30:22.632]  Handed out tax cuts without regard to deficits.
[03:30:25.848 --> 03:30:27.770]  Slash the safety net wherever it could.
[03:30:28.310 --> 03:30:32.733]  Cast dozens of votes to take away health insurance from ordinary Americans.
[03:30:34.414 --> 03:30:41.540]  Embrace wild conspiracy theories, like those surrounding Benghazi.
[03:30:43.519 --> 03:30:45.460]  Or my birth certificate.
[03:31:13.539 --> 03:31:21.421]  Well, the response was, hey Benghazi conspiracy theory, let's do this then and tell me if it's conspiracy theory after this or conspiracy.
[03:31:21.841 --> 03:31:22.902]  Let's put you on the roof.
[03:31:23.002 --> 03:31:31.584]  And I said, let's put your ass cowardly ass on the roof and shoot AK-47s and RPGs and lob mortars at you for 13 hours while you left, while you didn't send in your support.
[03:31:31.664 --> 03:31:32.925]  Basically, I just said, what happened that night?
[03:31:33.085 --> 03:31:37.146]  I was asked on Fox, you know, how do you feel when he said Benghazi was a conspiracy?
[03:31:37.186 --> 03:31:38.106]  Well, how do you think I feel?
[03:31:38.486 --> 03:31:40.607]  I was left behind by Barack Obama.
[03:31:40.667 --> 03:31:41.507]  The team was left behind.
[03:31:41.827 --> 03:31:42.647]  13 hours, 4 on.
[03:31:42.707 --> 03:31:43.447]  We lost people.
[03:31:43.487 --> 03:31:43.927]  They died.
[03:31:43.987 --> 03:31:44.828]  We continued to fight.
[03:31:44.848 --> 03:31:45.848]  We tried to save people.
[03:31:45.868 --> 03:31:50.649]  We saved over, including mine, counting my life and the team's lives, we saved over 30 people's lives.
[03:31:50.829 --> 03:31:53.390]  And then we come home and then we're called liars.
[03:31:53.570 --> 03:31:55.190]  And the story spun out of control.
[03:31:55.210 --> 03:31:59.511]  It was after 8 months of being called a liar, seeing him spin it, that finally it's out of control.
[03:31:59.551 --> 03:32:01.472]  So how do you think I'm going to feel when you say that?
[03:32:01.492 --> 03:32:02.292]  How do you feel right now?
[03:32:02.352 --> 03:32:04.152]  Well, I want to reach through the screen and choke him.
[03:32:04.172 --> 03:32:06.073]  Does that mean I want to kill the former president?
[03:32:06.153 --> 03:32:06.253]  No.
[03:32:06.493 --> 03:32:09.658]  It makes my blood boil because it's just disgusting.
[03:32:09.999 --> 03:32:11.160]  And it means that he doesn't care.
[03:32:11.541 --> 03:32:12.943]  He doesn't care anything about it.
[03:32:12.963 --> 03:32:16.248]  Yeah, why can't he embrace you guys and say, sorry, things broke down?
[03:32:16.268 --> 03:32:18.011]  Because they know they ordered the stand down.
[03:32:18.272 --> 03:32:19.133]  You don't stand down 13 hours.
[03:32:20.939 --> 03:32:25.061]  That is what, Alex, that is what I said to him when I came back from Yemen.
[03:32:25.081 --> 03:32:34.506]  I said, if you guys behind closed doors talking to my CIA personnel, my leadership of the CIA, if you could just tell me you're sorry, you don't even need to make it public.
[03:32:34.566 --> 03:32:37.347]  Just tell me you're sorry and I will go away and I'll go back to work.
[03:32:37.687 --> 03:32:38.588]  They couldn't even do that.
[03:32:39.108 --> 03:32:40.268]  That's narcissism, brother.
[03:32:40.448 --> 03:32:41.549]  That's pride talking.
[03:32:42.169 --> 03:32:43.009]  And that's evil.
[03:32:43.069 --> 03:32:43.709]  That's the devil.
[03:32:44.269 --> 03:32:45.249]  That's what we're up against.
[03:32:45.709 --> 03:32:48.690]  And if you want to quote me on that or use that as a talking point, fine.
[03:32:48.710 --> 03:32:53.211]  But as people are seeing now, essentially that is what we're up against right now.
[03:32:53.311 --> 03:32:53.971]  It's just pure evil.
[03:32:54.451 --> 03:32:54.971]  Pure evil.
[03:33:03.573 --> 03:33:06.214]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.709 --> 03:33:19.633]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:33:20.073 --> 03:33:23.997]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:24.597 --> 03:33:27.820]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:30.922 --> 03:33:31.703]  Welcome back.
[03:33:32.203 --> 03:33:50.454]  I'm Roger Stone, pinch hitting for the Alex Jones Show and broadcasting from a hotel room in Washington, D.C., where I'm here to not only meet with activists in preparation for the deep state's move on our president, which is surely coming,
[03:33:51.134 --> 03:33:55.777]  The Kavanaugh assault is the dry run for the establishment.
[03:33:56.297 --> 03:34:08.764]  It is their first attempt to take down a presidential nominee and to delay his Supreme Court appointment in the hopes that they will gain control of the U.S.
[03:34:08.784 --> 03:34:16.828]  Senate this November and thwart the president's attempt to have a conservative majority on the Supreme Court.
[03:34:17.589 --> 03:34:22.633]  Now, Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not my first choice for this nomination.
[03:34:22.693 --> 03:34:34.421]  In fact, I took to the airwaves right here at InfoWars, wrote an extensive piece about why I was concerned regarding his close relationship with the Bush crime family.
[03:34:35.482 --> 03:34:48.836]  And his role in the cover-up of the death of Vince Foster, the White House counsel to Bill and Hillary Clinton, whose body was found in Fort Marcy Park, Virginia.
[03:34:49.745 --> 03:34:52.828]  I don't think Foster was murdered by the Clintons.
[03:34:52.908 --> 03:34:54.649]  I believe he took his own life.
[03:34:55.210 --> 03:35:15.548]  But I'm virtually certain that the Clintons, particularly Mrs. Clinton, ordered that his body be removed from the old executive office building where I think he committed suicide after relentless verbal abuse by the First Lady in an open White House staff meeting, senior staff meeting.
[03:35:16.449 --> 03:35:27.417]  That would explain why the FBI toxicology report showed that his body was completely covered by fiber from a carpet.
[03:35:27.558 --> 03:35:30.440]  That's because they rolled him in a carpet to remove him.
[03:35:31.512 --> 03:35:37.839]  And I was concerned about the role that Brett Kavanaugh played regarding a man named Patrick Knowlton.
[03:35:37.859 --> 03:35:54.475]  Knowlton was just an everyday citizen who happened along the park at the wrong time, saw men emerging from the woods where they had dumped the body of Vince Foster, and then made the mistake of reporting that to the local police.
[03:35:55.294 --> 03:36:13.978]  That brought Brett Kavanaugh and the full force of the FBI to his door, demanding that he change his memory of what he had seen, and instructing him that he had seen a car with Arkansas plates there at the park that, in fact, he hadn't seen.
[03:36:14.985 --> 03:36:22.548]  He had seen a blue car with Arkansas plates, but as I recall it, Foster's car, planted later at the park, was brown.
[03:36:23.209 --> 03:36:28.211]  All of that said, I also said that I would support whoever the president nominated.
[03:36:28.971 --> 03:36:37.195]  And I believe that the charges against Brett Kavanaugh from all of these various women are false.
[03:36:38.183 --> 03:36:48.669]  What's amazing to me is that these same liberals, these so-called feminists, continue to this day to have no issue with Bill Clinton.
[03:36:49.510 --> 03:37:00.576]  Bill Clinton is not only a serial sexual assaulter, but he's also a rapist who violently bit women through the upper lip in order to disable them.
[03:37:01.678 --> 03:37:22.683]  He bit Juanita Broderick, who has been very brave in recent days, speaking out against her abuse at the hands of Bill Clinton, and pointing out the hypocrisy of those on the left, who to this day refuse to criticize Clinton for his abuse of women.
[03:37:23.283 --> 03:37:30.025]  But more precisely, those feminists who have no issue with the fact that it was Hillary Clinton
[03:37:30.658 --> 03:37:34.519]  Who ran the campaign to silence Bill's victims.
[03:37:35.019 --> 03:37:51.644]  It was Hillary Clinton who hired the heavy-handed private detectives and the mean lawyers to threaten women like Juanita Broderick and Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones and so many others into silence.
[03:37:52.325 --> 03:38:00.087]  Hillary Clinton told us that she was an advocate for women when in fact she was a terrorizer of women.
[03:38:00.948 --> 03:38:24.021]  Today, I saw a video of Hillary Clinton attacking Bill's victims, calling Jennifer Flowers, who was in a consensual relationship with her husband, a failed cabaret singer, calling the whole issue of Bill's abuse of women, Willie Horton Part 2.
[03:38:25.254 --> 03:38:27.174]  Nice try, Hillary.
[03:38:27.514 --> 03:38:28.835]  You are busted.
[03:38:29.555 --> 03:38:36.196]  Anybody who wants the facts on the Clinton's war on women can go to my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[03:38:36.656 --> 03:38:39.877]  It's available at the Infowars.com store now.
[03:38:40.597 --> 03:38:54.280]  This is the definitive oppo-dump on Bill and Hillary Clinton, the abusers of women, that the feminists who are raging against Brett Kavanaugh still refuse, even today, to criticize.
[03:38:55.077 --> 03:38:55.878]  Hypocrisy.
[03:38:56.478 --> 03:38:58.000]  Thy name is liberal.
[03:38:58.540 --> 03:39:02.003]  Let's take, for example, Senator Mazie Hirono.
[03:39:02.664 --> 03:39:07.028]  An amazing interview the other day where she said men just need to shut up.
[03:39:07.828 --> 03:39:17.277]  And that it's time to step up and block the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh based on no evidence, no corroboration, and no proof.
[03:39:18.058 --> 03:39:21.799]  But where was Mazie Hirono when senior U.S.
[03:39:21.839 --> 03:39:30.721]  Senator Dan Inouye, the man who dominated the Hawaii Democratic machine, was a U.S.
[03:39:30.761 --> 03:39:37.582]  Senator, and he was accused of sexual assault by a woman named Lenore Kwok, a hairdresser.
[03:39:38.382 --> 03:39:45.884]  At that point, Senator Hirono was in her 12th term in the Hawaii House, and do you know what she said?
[03:39:47.164 --> 03:39:47.604]  Nothing.
[03:39:48.588 --> 03:39:50.030]  Absolutely nothing.
[03:39:51.171 --> 03:39:55.556]  So, Mazie, why didn't you step up, as you put it?
[03:39:56.096 --> 03:39:58.999]  Perhaps you're the one who should shut up.
[03:40:00.241 --> 03:40:05.867]  It is extraordinary to see the enormous hypocrisy of these Democrats.
[03:40:07.693 --> 03:40:10.234]  Let's take, for example, Richard Blumenthal.
[03:40:10.934 --> 03:40:25.559]  Blumenthal actually has the cojones to read the Latin translation of the legal maxim, that if you are caught lying about one thing, it is reasonable to assume that you are lying about everything.
[03:40:25.579 --> 03:40:35.963]  Well, Senator Blumenthal, what about your lying about serving in the military in Vietnam, when you never were anywhere near Vietnam?
[03:40:36.539 --> 03:40:40.661]  You use this in every campaign for public office you ran in.
[03:40:41.302 --> 03:40:43.443]  We still have no apology from you.
[03:40:43.923 --> 03:40:46.785]  We still have no acknowledgement that you lied.
[03:40:46.805 --> 03:40:58.031]  Do you really have the audacity to accuse Brett Kavanaugh of lying, giving your history as a serial liar?
[03:40:58.968 --> 03:41:00.810]  Yes, that's Richard Blumenthal.
[03:41:01.250 --> 03:41:08.777]  He's a disgrace to those brave men and women from the nutmeg state who did serve their country in Vietnam.
[03:41:09.317 --> 03:41:15.383]  Yet, he continues his unrelenting attack on Brett Kavanaugh.
[03:41:16.195 --> 03:41:21.919]  In the meantime, folks, I want to commend Alex Jones for having the courage to sue PayPal.
[03:41:22.479 --> 03:41:27.563]  It's really not about the economics, it's about exposing exactly what's going on here.
[03:41:28.043 --> 03:41:31.926]  And before it's all over, I fear he's going to have to sue Apple.
[03:41:32.626 --> 03:41:42.948]  Facebook, Twitter, and all of these social media platforms that are so desperate to end the clarion call of what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:41:43.408 --> 03:41:49.829]  Because you see, it is only under oath and in discovery that we can really prove their insidious plot.
[03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:59.151]  That we can prove that the Apple CEO, Tim Cook, when he says he's never discussed Alex Jones with anyone, is lying through his teeth.
[03:41:59.911 --> 03:42:08.534]  In the meantime, these lawsuits cost money, and therefore I ask you to go to the InfoWars.com store now and find the Donate button.
[03:42:09.174 --> 03:42:17.857]  Even if you're not in the mood or the market for one of our great nutraceuticals or a book or a t-shirt, we'll show you right now how you can donate.
[03:42:18.437 --> 03:42:18.898]  Send us $25, $50, $100, $500.
[03:42:19.018 --> 03:42:19.859]  Some have even sent, yes, $1,000.
[03:42:19.999 --> 03:42:21.481]  Because our fight is your fight.
[03:42:21.501 --> 03:42:24.625]  If they silence Alex Jones today, who will be silenced tomorrow?
[03:42:36.841 --> 03:42:38.843]  We need your support.
[03:42:39.203 --> 03:42:43.287]  Please find that donate button and send us a generous contribution.
[03:42:43.747 --> 03:42:49.071]  We will never fold on you, but we need you to have our back.
[03:42:49.692 --> 03:42:50.613]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:51.093 --> 03:42:52.334]  I'll be right back.
[03:42:53.715 --> 03:42:53.875]  Now!
[03:42:53.895 --> 03:42:55.777]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:43:05.345 --> 03:43:07.426]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:43:07.707 --> 03:43:08.747]  I believe in you!
[03:43:08.767 --> 03:43:10.328]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:43:12.009 --> 03:43:14.991]  One man ever raped a woman!
[03:43:15.332 --> 03:43:16.913]  All genitals were cut off!
[03:43:17.173 --> 03:43:19.594]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:43:19.734 --> 03:43:20.955]  And we're not backing down ever!
[03:43:22.236 --> 03:43:24.017]  I wanna kick these people!
[03:43:24.057 --> 03:43:24.577]  We're winning!
[03:43:24.637 --> 03:43:25.718]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:25.878 --> 03:43:26.359]  Can't you?
[03:43:26.639 --> 03:43:28.260]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:28.640 --> 03:43:29.801]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:33.643 --> 03:43:34.184]  Let's go!
[03:43:35.586 --> 03:43:35.986]  Come on!
[03:43:36.006 --> 03:43:36.226]  Come on!

[03:43:37.427 --> 03:43:37.627]  Come on!
[03:43:37.647 --> 03:43:37.967]  Come on!
[03:43:38.067 --> 03:43:38.327]  Come on!

[03:43:59.953 --> 03:44:08.178]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:44:08.378 --> 03:44:09.638]  Believe me, I know.
[03:44:09.839 --> 03:44:14.161]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:44:14.581 --> 03:44:19.584]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:44:19.824 --> 03:44:40.070]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:44:40.570 --> 03:44:44.333]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:45:06.583 --> 03:45:08.704]  Let's go to Jason in New Mexico.
[03:45:08.764 --> 03:45:09.245]  Fire away.
[03:45:09.265 --> 03:45:09.325]  Hey!
[03:45:09.365 --> 03:45:09.465]  Hey!
[03:45:09.485 --> 03:45:09.585]  Hey!
[03:45:09.605 --> 03:45:09.705]  Hey!
[03:45:09.725 --> 03:45:09.825]  Hey!
[03:45:25.693 --> 03:45:28.714]  Hey, I just came out as a transsexual gay toad.
[03:45:28.814 --> 03:45:32.575]  I'm not going to have you slander my people before I run for office as a Democrat.
[03:45:32.655 --> 03:45:39.237]  I know that's right, but really, we should contribute to you guys because I've been given for years and I've seen the production value just skyrocket.
[03:45:39.257 --> 03:45:43.639]  I mean, your graphics team, just the content in general, everything is going great.
[03:45:43.739 --> 03:45:50.181]  And at the same time, there's no better organization that I could give my dollars to, to see it at work on a daily basis.
[03:45:50.461 --> 03:45:54.042]  Well, and we appreciate you, Jason, and that's why we try to give you the best products.
[03:45:54.062 --> 03:45:56.583]  You know, we just don't put something out there and say, hey, please buy it.
[03:45:56.663 --> 03:46:00.905]  We do the research and then actually put out the best possible product.
[03:46:00.985 --> 03:46:03.906]  In the five years of my support, I have never bought a bad product.
[03:46:03.966 --> 03:46:10.628]  And I waste a lot of money on, you know, you go to one of these big box stores, you buy a piece of crap, and the psychologist throw away $10.
[03:46:10.988 --> 03:46:13.909]  You throw $10 at that toothpaste, guarantee it won't be a waste.
[03:46:13.989 --> 03:46:16.550]  Especially if you love your kids, why would you give them fluoride?
[03:46:17.170 --> 03:46:18.150]  Yeah, yeah, just go look.
[03:46:18.371 --> 03:46:19.831]  You know, here's what I would say to the audience.
[03:46:19.911 --> 03:46:28.115]  If you're not using super blue fluoride toothpaste, go home and look at the toothpaste that you're using, and on the back of it, it will say, harmful if swallowed.
[03:46:28.415 --> 03:46:34.157]  Contact poison control for 0.01% of fluoride.
[03:46:34.858 --> 03:46:36.078]  0.01, harmful if swallowed.
[03:46:36.238 --> 03:46:37.399]  They put that in the water.
[03:46:37.419 --> 03:46:38.779]  Yep, that's if you love the kids, though.
[03:46:38.799 --> 03:46:40.560]  Hey, I'm not telling you how to spend your money.
[03:46:40.580 --> 03:46:40.960]  Yeah, you know what?
[03:46:40.980 --> 03:46:41.220]  Good point.
[03:46:41.260 --> 03:46:43.361]  If you don't love your kids, just keep giving them the fluoride.
[03:46:43.381 --> 03:46:43.881]  Yeah, that's fine.
[03:46:45.502 --> 03:46:51.207]  No matter what the globalists want to do, no matter what politicians want to do, this country is going to make it!
[03:47:15.140 --> 03:47:18.626]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:19.307 --> 03:47:21.812]  You're listening to Roger Stone on N4.
[03:47:28.146 --> 03:47:28.867]  Welcome back.
[03:47:29.227 --> 03:47:33.611]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for the great Alex Jones.
[03:47:34.412 --> 03:47:49.465]  And now we're going to take you to a really incredible report from Millie Weaver, who brings us this report from Johnson City, Tennessee, where President Donald Trump has just had a rally.
[03:47:49.485 --> 03:47:52.047]  This will really blow your mind.
[03:47:52.107 --> 03:47:52.848]  Let's roll it.
[03:47:54.045 --> 03:47:57.609]  So why are you waving a Mexican flag like from Mexico?
[03:47:57.669 --> 03:47:58.310]  From Mexico.
[03:47:58.330 --> 03:48:01.733]  We support Mexicans all the way.
[03:48:02.374 --> 03:48:04.116]  So what is the point of it?
[03:48:04.156 --> 03:48:05.718]  Do you guys want to be Americans?
[03:48:06.138 --> 03:48:06.779]  We're not.
[03:48:06.859 --> 03:48:07.640]  No, we're U.S.
[03:48:07.660 --> 03:48:09.061]  citizens, but we're just not.
[03:48:09.141 --> 03:48:09.942]  We don't support Trump.
[03:48:10.856 --> 03:48:13.418]  So do you support America?
[03:48:13.438 --> 03:48:16.781]  I support a good America.
[03:48:16.801 --> 03:48:18.283]  You support a good America?
[03:48:18.343 --> 03:48:18.563]  Yes.
[03:48:19.163 --> 03:48:23.327]  So then why do you guys wave a Mexico flag and not an America flag?
[03:48:23.367 --> 03:48:24.648]  We support Mexico.
[03:48:24.728 --> 03:48:26.010]  It's Trump not supporting us.
[03:48:27.276 --> 03:48:28.957]  So, what did you say?
[03:48:29.957 --> 03:48:32.538]  We're supporting our Mexico because Trump doesn't support us.
[03:48:32.558 --> 03:48:33.518]  We support our culture.
[03:48:33.618 --> 03:48:33.839]  Yeah.
[03:48:33.859 --> 03:48:36.139]  We don't think our culture should be deported.
[03:48:36.560 --> 03:48:38.080]  Okay, so you're U.S.
[03:48:38.140 --> 03:48:39.401]  citizens though, right?
[03:48:40.101 --> 03:48:40.241]  Yeah.
[03:48:40.281 --> 03:48:41.161]  We're U.S.
[03:48:41.321 --> 03:48:41.902]  citizens.
[03:48:42.142 --> 03:48:44.523]  So isn't your culture American?
[03:48:45.223 --> 03:48:46.003]  No.
[03:48:46.023 --> 03:48:48.084]  We come from a Mexican lineage.
[03:48:48.284 --> 03:48:49.825]  Therefore, we brought it here into America.
[03:48:49.885 --> 03:48:52.426]  That's why we're a melting pot here in America.
[03:48:53.226 --> 03:48:58.252]  Well, don't you think most people come from different countries, but then they wave the American flag?
[03:48:58.272 --> 03:49:01.855]  Like, for example, many of my ancestors are from Ireland.
[03:49:02.336 --> 03:49:06.881]  I'm not, you know, I wouldn't go around waving an Irish flag in America.
[03:49:07.722 --> 03:49:09.684]  You know, we all have our own preferences, ma'am.
[03:49:11.065 --> 03:49:11.966]  We're Mexicans.
[03:49:12.006 --> 03:49:13.228]  We are Mexican-Americans.
[03:49:13.508 --> 03:49:16.092]  So are you Mexicans first or Americans first?
[03:49:16.112 --> 03:49:16.232]  Yes.
[03:49:16.252 --> 03:49:17.233]  I'm a Mexican first.
[03:49:18.335 --> 03:49:19.536]  I'm a Mexican first.
[03:49:19.556 --> 03:49:21.679]  Because my parents are from Mexico.
[03:49:21.919 --> 03:49:23.982]  So you're Mexican first.
[03:49:24.302 --> 03:49:26.425]  So would you rather be in Mexico or America?
[03:49:26.445 --> 03:49:28.608]  I can be in both.
[03:49:29.628 --> 03:49:30.348]  Whenever I want.
[03:49:30.368 --> 03:49:31.288]  Okay.
[03:49:31.709 --> 03:49:34.449]  So is that why you want open borders and stuff?
[03:49:34.889 --> 03:49:35.049]  Yes.
[03:49:35.069 --> 03:49:35.509]  Why not?
[03:49:35.629 --> 03:49:39.230]  Why is Trump's hate so much against Mexico?
[03:49:39.250 --> 03:49:41.191]  What has Mexico ever done to Trump?
[03:49:41.391 --> 03:49:41.991]  Nothing, right?
[03:49:42.251 --> 03:49:45.812]  Well, he just entered- Separating families is a disgrace.
[03:49:46.212 --> 03:49:46.432]  Yes.
[03:49:46.452 --> 03:49:48.693]  Putting children in cages is a disgrace.
[03:49:48.873 --> 03:49:57.755]  So what do you guys think about Trump just negotiating a deal with Mexico, a trade deal with Mexico and Canada that's going to be mutually beneficial?
[03:49:57.915 --> 03:49:58.555]  He hasn't yet.
[03:49:58.975 --> 03:49:59.455]  He has.
[03:49:59.716 --> 03:50:01.356]  We're just waiting for Congress to approve it.
[03:50:01.376 --> 03:50:02.077]  What do you think about it?
[03:50:02.577 --> 03:50:03.317]  I don't think it's right.
[03:50:04.058 --> 03:50:07.400]  Do you think that the Mexican president shouldn't have agreed to terms with him?
[03:50:07.900 --> 03:50:08.320]  Him too.
[03:50:08.620 --> 03:50:08.920]  Really?
[03:50:08.940 --> 03:50:09.361]  Yeah.
[03:50:10.301 --> 03:50:12.222]  That's f***ed up.
[03:50:12.702 --> 03:50:12.982]  Why?
[03:50:13.163 --> 03:50:14.603]  What's bad about the deal?
[03:50:27.845 --> 03:50:31.153]  Alright, a terrific report from Millie Weaver.
[03:50:32.784 --> 03:50:37.907]  Millie, I just want to remind you, those women have to be believed because, of course, they're women.
[03:50:37.967 --> 03:50:39.708]  That's the new standard.
[03:50:40.329 --> 03:50:46.473]  A standard that is important in every regard except for when you're talking about Bill or Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:46.974 --> 03:51:00.383]  Speaking of Hillary Clinton, if you still have your Bill Clinton rape whistles or your Bill Clinton rape t-shirt, you might want to get them out because Hillary Clinton is headed to South Florida
[03:51:01.150 --> 03:51:03.371]  On October 23rd.
[03:51:04.472 --> 03:51:28.642]  And it is important for us to remind people of Bill Clinton's long, documented history as an abuser of women, a man who has not only sexually assaulted, exposed himself to, but bitten multiple women, or through the upper lip, a classic disabling move for an experienced rapist.
[03:51:29.743 --> 03:51:38.799]  Uh, and the Clinton rape t-shirt, which we just showed you, which will ultimately end up in the Smithsonian, is an iconic, uh...
[03:51:40.729 --> 03:51:45.633]  Memento from the most improbable election in American history.
[03:51:46.213 --> 03:52:07.308]  You see, back in the 1980s, when we only had three television networks, and CNN and Fox were in their infancy, it was much easier to mow mow the national press, to intimidate them and bully them out of reporting about Bill Clinton's epic
[03:52:12.828 --> 03:52:13.168]  I don't
[03:52:32.021 --> 03:52:51.098]  Where Ron DeSantis, a Trump supporter, a member of Congress who resigned his seat in order to pursue this campaign for governor, is locked in a skin-tight battle with Andrew Gillum, the Socialist Democrat mayor of Tallahassee.
[03:52:51.859 --> 03:52:55.402]  Also on the ballot is a pivotally important U.S.
[03:52:55.442 --> 03:52:56.043]  Senate race.
[03:52:56.643 --> 03:52:57.545]  We're good to go.
[03:53:15.804 --> 03:53:30.707]  When the voters approved medicinal marijuana, they did not anticipate that the Republican legislature would pass enabling legislation which says you can have medicinal cannabis, you just can't smoke it.
[03:53:31.568 --> 03:53:42.410]  Well, that means that people who use cannabis as medicine need to either have a vape device or use the more expensive orals.
[03:53:43.064 --> 03:53:49.187]  Clearly, it's aimed at poor people and disproportionately African Americans.
[03:53:49.667 --> 03:54:01.554]  This is very unpopular, so John Morgan, the man who put medicinal marijuana on the ballot, took Governor Rick Scott to court and he won.
[03:54:02.074 --> 03:54:07.777]  The courts avoided the law that said you could not smoke medicinal cannabis.
[03:54:08.477 --> 03:54:13.419]  Now, Governor Rick Scott insists on appealing that ruling.
[03:54:14.019 --> 03:54:18.100]  There is not a lawyer alive who believes he will win that appeal.
[03:54:18.860 --> 03:54:24.882]  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people wait for their medicine.
[03:54:25.342 --> 03:54:32.105]  Medicine they take as an alternative to the far more damaging and deleterious opioids.
[03:54:33.005 --> 03:54:36.686]  Will this race take down the entire Republican ticket?
[03:54:37.512 --> 03:54:48.921]  Unfortunately, Republican candidate Ron DeSantis, who I'm actually supporting, has agreed to support Governor Rick Scott's appeal.
[03:54:49.502 --> 03:54:53.145]  So have the other Republican candidates on the ballot.
[03:54:53.849 --> 03:54:59.094]  This could be the secret weapon of the Democrats in a battleground state.
[03:54:59.694 --> 03:55:05.299]  Let me remind you, both John McCain and Mitt Romney lost Florida.
[03:55:05.819 --> 03:55:19.311]  Donald Trump won Florida on the basis of an extraordinarily strong performance in the state's rural areas, overcoming an enormous Democratic advantage in the three southern counties.
[03:55:20.075 --> 03:55:23.916]  Everyone will be watching Florida to see how it goes.
[03:55:24.396 --> 03:55:28.857]  It will be viewed as a precursor for the 2020 election.
[03:55:29.638 --> 03:55:41.281]  Will Governor Rick Scott and his anti-cannabis position, rejected by 71.5% of Florida voters, take down the entire Republican ticket?
[03:55:42.049 --> 03:55:43.930]  It's entirely possible.
[03:55:44.751 --> 03:55:51.716]  In the meantime, we will be greeting Hillary Clinton in full force on October 23rd.
[03:55:52.216 --> 03:56:02.484]  So watch us here at InfoWars for more information about where and when you can go protest the lady who will be showing up wearing a shower curtain.
[03:56:03.124 --> 03:56:06.645]  If her recent public performances are any indication.
[03:56:07.406 --> 03:56:08.306]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:56:08.326 --> 03:56:10.227]  This has been the Alex Jones Show.
[03:56:10.627 --> 03:56:17.510]  I'm glad that we were able to overcome our technological difficulties, even if they included bringing you this show by telephone.
[03:56:17.910 --> 03:56:20.491]  And I ask you once more to do two things.
[03:56:21.071 --> 03:56:23.574]  Go to the InfoWars.com store now.
[03:56:23.674 --> 03:56:32.125]  And if you're not in the market for one of our great products, and by the way, Brain Force Plus at 40% off is a terrific buy.
[03:56:32.505 --> 03:56:35.289]  Mental clarity and energy in a bottle.
[03:56:35.729 --> 03:56:40.255]  Safe and effective with thousands of satisfied reviews.
[03:56:40.875 --> 03:56:44.779]  And when you're finished there, go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:45.220 --> 03:56:47.382]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:56:47.862 --> 03:56:57.753]  Robert Mueller and his deep state thugs are poking into every aspect of my personal, private, business, social, and family life.
[03:56:58.353 --> 03:56:58.734]  Why?
[03:56:58.754 --> 03:57:03.038]  Does it have to do with Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration?
[03:57:03.478 --> 03:57:03.659]  No.
[03:57:04.379 --> 03:57:07.822]  I'm being persecuted for one reason and one reason only.
[03:57:08.322 --> 03:57:10.504]  Because I appear here on InfoWars.
[03:57:10.804 --> 03:57:13.446]  Because I bring you the cutting-edge truth.
[03:57:13.826 --> 03:57:19.551]  And because I supported Donald Trump for president and helped defeat Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:19.991 --> 03:57:22.313]  Don't let them shut InfoWars down.
[03:57:22.673 --> 03:57:24.474]  Don't let them silence me.
[03:57:24.795 --> 03:57:26.476]  We need your support today.
[03:57:26.956 --> 03:57:28.898]  Thank you and God bless you.
[03:57:33.032 --> 03:57:46.657]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:57:51.018 --> 03:57:56.480]  And all these other company heads and all these other people know this and they won't say it so I'm here
[03:57:59.309 --> 03:58:00.550]  Stop the hammering.
[03:58:01.010 --> 03:58:02.491]  Stop the hammering out there.
[03:58:02.531 --> 03:58:03.372]  Who's got a hammer?
[03:58:03.632 --> 03:58:04.152]  Where is it?
[03:58:04.472 --> 03:58:04.833]  Hammering.
[03:58:05.153 --> 03:58:05.553]  Hammering.
[03:58:05.793 --> 03:58:06.214]  Hammering.
[03:58:06.474 --> 03:58:06.874]  Hammering.
[03:58:07.274 --> 03:58:08.155]  Where's the hammer?
[03:58:08.975 --> 03:58:10.817]  Is it on the... Go up on the other floor.
[03:58:10.917 --> 03:58:13.058]  Somebody go up there and stop the hammering.
[03:58:13.238 --> 03:58:13.619]  Hammering.
[03:58:13.899 --> 03:58:14.319]  Hammering.
[03:58:14.559 --> 03:58:14.959]  Hammering.
[03:58:15.220 --> 03:58:15.620]  Hammering.
[03:58:15.880 --> 03:58:16.300]  Hammering.
[03:58:16.661 --> 03:58:18.282]  Stop the hammering.
[03:58:18.802 --> 03:58:19.162]  Hammering.
[03:58:19.462 --> 03:58:19.863]  Hammering.
[03:58:20.123 --> 03:58:20.543]  Hammering.
[03:58:20.803 --> 03:58:21.224]  Hammering.
[03:58:21.424 --> 03:58:22.765]  Call f***ing Phil Griffin.
[03:58:22.805 --> 03:58:24.366]  I don't care who the f*** you have to call.
[03:58:24.506 --> 03:58:26.027]  Stop the hammering.
[03:58:26.287 --> 03:58:26.687]  Hammering.
[03:58:26.927 --> 03:58:27.288]  Hammering.
[03:58:30.134 --> 03:58:32.335]  And all these traders don't get it.
[03:58:32.896 --> 03:58:39.299]  Now it's being taken away because they demand control the streets, control the schools, control your bank account.
[03:58:39.879 --> 03:58:41.920]  It just f***ing sucks.
[03:58:42.261 --> 03:58:46.483]  It f***ing sucks to be out here with this out of control s***.
[03:58:47.223 --> 03:58:53.146]  Control the churches, control the food you eat, control the vaccines they put in your body, control the internet, control everything.
[03:58:53.186 --> 03:58:53.547]  They're here.
[03:58:54.047 --> 03:58:56.948]  Any f***ing thing can come into my ear at any moment.
[03:58:57.009 --> 03:58:57.729]  That's what I know.
[03:58:58.429 --> 03:58:59.770]  Anybody can get
