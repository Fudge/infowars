[00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:14.604]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:32.473]  Here we are, live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:33.593 --> 00:00:34.593]  So close to the election.
[00:00:36.134 --> 00:00:37.055]  So close, 57 days out.
[00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:46.162]  We're only one day away from the anniversary of the biggest terror attack in world history, not just U.S.
[00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:46.583]  history.
[00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:50.806]  9-11 was coordinated by Saudi Arabia and elements of the Deep State.
[00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:55.649]  Now we've been vindicated on exposing that in the 28 pages and so much more.
[00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.671]  Okay.
[00:00:59.332 --> 00:01:04.816]  The news I have, the magnitude of it, is so staggering that I'm actually extremely calm.
[00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:09.988]  I normally get really wound up because I've got so much I want to cover and so many angles.
[00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:17.393]  Today, things are so crystal clear and so amazing that I'm very, very calm.
[00:01:19.614 --> 00:01:30.302]  Obviously we have the incredible red meat of tyranny and of arrogance and of just over-the-top nerve.
[00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.654]  Of Obama saying you'll never get the country to three percent, it's impossible.
[00:01:35.154 --> 00:01:36.955]  Paul Krugman says so at the New York Times.
[00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:38.717]  What do you have, a magic wand?
[00:01:38.737 --> 00:01:48.204]  And now coming out and saying that it's an economic miracle that he created and taking credit for Trump.
[00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:50.846]  It's next level.
[00:01:52.087 --> 00:01:55.029]  And also saying Benghazi itself is just a conspiracy theory.
[00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.212]  Kind of like if one of your kids dies in a car wreck.
[00:01:58.232 --> 00:02:01.034]  Just say, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that Bobby ever existed.
[00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:15.101]  Or Grandma Never Existed, or Obama's Order of a Stand Down with Hillary, in Benghazi, and all those people getting killed, and the rest of it, and then they just come out and say things like that.
[00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:18.123]  It really is amazing.
[00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:20.405]  But that's not our big story today.
[00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:24.087]  That's not our big story today.
[00:02:24.167 --> 00:02:25.708]  And I'm gonna cover it, and I'm gonna get into it.
[00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.312]  I made some phone calls this weekend, and I got some phone calls.
[00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:33.138]  Three phone calls.
[00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:38.640]  And I was told the same thing in all three phone calls.
[00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:44.162]  And it just confirmed everything I knew and why we got banned.
[00:02:44.803 --> 00:03:01.629]  And there's a lot of reasons went into it, but the big ones center around the fact that when I get up here and I say that our deep state sold us out to China and that China is to be in the preeminent role in this deal.
[00:03:04.445 --> 00:03:13.911]  When I said that Apple and Google have officially moved there to build the most high-tech AI systems, search engine, censorship, total control, that's admitted.
[00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:23.096]  But the fact that I was calling for action, and the fact that they know I'm getting briefings through sources we have to the president,
[00:03:24.887 --> 00:03:30.872]  Is the reason that they are strongly considering not just kicking me off the internet completely, but doing something else.
[00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:33.414]  And I think you all know what we're talking about here.
[00:03:33.794 --> 00:03:35.196]  I don't say that to be dramatic.
[00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:40.400]  I'm a loyal American citizen, and I believe in America, and I'm a patriot.
[00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:42.762]  And I have to do this.
[00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:47.286]  I have to stay the course, no matter what the cost is.
[00:03:47.326 --> 00:03:49.928]  And I've pledged I'm going to do it because it's the right thing to do.
[00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.671]  But the average person isn't acting like
[00:03:54.773 --> 00:03:55.974]  This is as big a deal as it is.
[00:03:55.994 --> 00:04:07.419]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to lay it out with very, very calm focus in the next segment.
[00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:09.980]  And then I'm going to
[00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:12.565]  Lay out the details of it.
[00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:17.567]  And then I'll get into just the general hatred for this country by the ruling class.
[00:04:17.607 --> 00:04:20.148]  And then you understand why they would want to sell us out to China.
[00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:27.230]  A soulless communist state with five times the number of murdered citizens than what Hitler racked up.
[00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.231]  I mean, those aren't words.
[00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.111]  That's history.
[00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.551]  That's fact.
[00:04:32.832 --> 00:04:35.593]  And, you know, I'm honored to stand against Tim Cook.
[00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:39.314]  And I'm honored to stand against the executives at Google.
[00:04:41.109 --> 00:04:46.831]  And I'm honored to stand up against Jack Dorsey and all the rest of these people, because I'm not a traitor.
[00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:53.473]  I would sell out to something superior and something better, because that wouldn't be selling out, that would be adopting it.
[00:04:53.953 --> 00:04:54.894]  I would marry into that.
[00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:57.595]  No, I will fight to the end against this.
[00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:01.416]  This is pure treachery, pure anti-human evil.
[00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:11.479]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:12.759]  And I want to thank you all.
[00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:13.800]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.601]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:21.924]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[00:05:22.184 --> 00:05:24.325]  And we've got products that help you.
[00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:27.306]  I mean, even mainstream media admits they have to, that fish roe is the best thing out there.
[00:05:27.506 --> 00:05:28.707]  But you want the pure fish oil.
[00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:30.209]  You want the mercury removed.
[00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:32.631]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:33.512]  The best krill oil.
[00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:36.215]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[00:05:36.275 --> 00:05:39.738]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[00:05:40.178 --> 00:05:40.659]  The honor roll.
[00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:41.299]  Three different types.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.260]  You cannot do better.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.921]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:43.722]  Help the brain.
[00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:44.202]  Help the body.
[00:05:44.242 --> 00:05:44.683]  Help the heart.
[00:05:44.703 --> 00:05:45.243]  Help the InfoWare.
[00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:45.884]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[00:05:46.004 --> 00:05:46.444]  Win, win, win.
[00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:49.505]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula about to sell out bodies at 50% off.
[00:05:49.605 --> 00:05:51.505]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[00:05:51.605 --> 00:05:53.406]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:59.187]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[00:05:59.507 --> 00:05:59.947]  I need it!
[00:06:06.109 --> 00:06:08.309]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.951]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:30.782 --> 00:06:31.963]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:38.368]  This is the most censored, most banned, most demonized broadcast in the world.
[00:06:39.588 --> 00:06:48.575]  I am the first major multimedia news organization to be banned by corporate racketeering blockade.
[00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:53.439]  And it's being done for a reason I'm going to expose to you right now then we'll get into
[00:06:55.293 --> 00:07:02.720]  Obama taking credit even more disgustingly this weekend than he did on Friday, saying I am the reason the economy is good.
[00:07:03.221 --> 00:07:14.371]  Not workers, or not cutting taxes, or not turning loose the power of the American people, but he says he is the reason.
[00:07:15.793 --> 00:07:18.816]  And then if you criticize that on Twitter or Facebook, they ban you.
[00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:33.519]  And we now know that 57 days out from this most important election ever, that you criticize Democratic lawmakers in any way, on any multimedia, social media, you are going to be restricted or banned.
[00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:36.942]  They are making their authoritarian move, as we warned everyone.
[00:07:39.144 --> 00:07:45.108]  Now that said, let me tell you that we'll be covering all that coming up in the segments to come.
[00:07:46.649 --> 00:07:48.431]  But I first want to direct everybody to
[00:07:50.327 --> 00:07:51.808]  Infowars.com right now.
[00:07:52.488 --> 00:08:01.813]  It is absolutely critical that everyone see the article and the live feed so we can be proactive and share this with everyone we know right now.
[00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:05.355]  Go there on your phone.
[00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:06.415]  Grab the URL.
[00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:07.796]  Text it out to everybody you know.
[00:08:07.856 --> 00:08:08.416]  Group text.
[00:08:08.876 --> 00:08:09.817]  Tell people in person.
[00:08:09.857 --> 00:08:10.857]  We're in an emergency.
[00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.799]  What I'm about to tell you is absolute fact.
[00:08:17.236 --> 00:08:26.998]  And it affects you and your family unlike anything on this planet, and it is earth-shattering, and it's happening in live time right now.
[00:08:28.458 --> 00:08:30.579]  It is your future, everything on the line.
[00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.719]  Your children, my children, everybody.
[00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:35.880]  Look at the headline.
[00:08:38.041 --> 00:08:38.701]  Watch live.
[00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:44.262]  China secretly declared war on the United States two years ago.
[00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:52.536]  And is working with globalists deep state against our nation.
[00:08:53.297 --> 00:09:00.363]  We are witnessing 21st century 6th generation warfare.
[00:09:05.047 --> 00:09:11.232]  Now, you can pull up the Chinese generals two years ago saying we are at war with the United States in their major publications.
[00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:12.914]  You can see the action they took.
[00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:19.874]  You can see the major companies and corporations deciding to join with China when that announcement was made.
[00:09:20.154 --> 00:09:20.755]  To roll over.
[00:09:22.256 --> 00:09:23.577]  Chief amongst them, Apple.
[00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:39.610]  You can see, right after Trump won, 20 months ago, in the winter of 2017 in Davos, Switzerland,
[00:09:44.926 --> 00:09:58.992]  The dictator of China traveling to that mountaintop in Switzerland and saying, I will help you keep our world government plan together, we will defeat Trump and America.
[00:10:00.092 --> 00:10:13.238]  And Juncker, the Nazi heir of the entire Nazi fortune, his grandfather ran the whole show, he pledged to, quote, crush America.
[00:10:14.642 --> 00:10:15.283]  In a trade war.
[00:10:17.524 --> 00:10:20.086]  These people have real hate for America.
[00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:31.976]  And the robber barons that set up this modern system a hundred years ago, they have real hatred for you because the American system has beat them at least four times in the last 240 years.
[00:10:33.037 --> 00:10:34.278]  And so there's a score to settle.
[00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:42.004]  And the authoritarians made the conscious decision
[00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:59.956]  50 years ago to de-industrialize and sell out this country, and at the 11th hour, 58 minute mark, Trump got in, and other nationalists got in because it's so obvious how authoritarian and evil this is.
[00:11:02.556 --> 00:11:09.598]  And so, we were taken down five weeks ago, off of 20 plus platforms, now it's 30 plus,
[00:11:11.058 --> 00:11:15.962]  The Apple app was removed that already had over 2 million downloads on Friday.
[00:11:16.202 --> 00:11:22.426]  You still have it on your phone for now until they do updates, but you can't in the future go download it or find it.
[00:11:23.627 --> 00:11:28.151]  And to add insult to injury, when you search for Infowars or Alex Jones, you get Huffington Post, so they like to rub it in.
[00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.812]  That's the technocrats in control of your life.
[00:11:32.994 --> 00:11:34.095]  That's a day after Twitter banned me.
[00:11:36.057 --> 00:11:40.240]  You have to understand that that was done because
[00:11:43.439 --> 00:11:45.779]  I am exposing the real war that's going on.
[00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:50.100]  This is a 21st century, sixth generation war.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.681]  You're already facing automated systems that are artificially intelligent, just not autonomous.
[00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:00.262]  What they call sentient.
[00:12:01.502 --> 00:12:12.264]  Some in IBM in this big race, and some in Microsoft believe they actually do have autonomous robots and autonomous machines now, autonomous brains.
[00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:21.815]  But that they're just basically the equivalent of someone who's mentally retarded when it comes to being able to be aware of the fact that they're conscious.
[00:12:21.835 --> 00:12:25.837]  But they could be totally conscious or beyond that for all we know.
[00:12:26.597 --> 00:12:35.642]  But there is a great arrogance by the political establishment that it's just a race and it's going to happen and humans are obsolete.
[00:12:38.482 --> 00:12:45.624]  And that it's over for the nation state and free market, that the rise of the technocrats and the authoritarians is here in their own words.
[00:12:46.024 --> 00:13:04.989]  At Davos, they've been saying for 10 years, we're going to have a world government, we're not going to have elected governments anymore, you can just type into Bloomberg, Davos elite declare themselves technocrats, they declare rule of the technocrats, they say the age of the technological dictatorship is here, and the techno-dictators, this is what they're saying.
[00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.870]  And the communist Chinese,
[00:13:08.717 --> 00:13:16.401]  You are a million percent bought into this, and have killed five times the people Hitler did, and are true bloody tyrants.
[00:13:20.143 --> 00:13:33.549]  And Google and Apple have completely merged with the Chinese Communists, and have wedded themselves to them, and we are the bride, they are the groom.
[00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.610]  They do the pitching.
[00:13:36.963 --> 00:13:38.724]  That is the position the CFR says.
[00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:40.105]  America is subservient.
[00:13:40.826 --> 00:13:42.907]  We gave them the Panama Canal, all the secrets.
[00:13:43.668 --> 00:13:45.889]  There's only one group that can't get this through their head.
[00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:49.012]  They've tried to have Thomas Barnett come and give them work college speeches.
[00:13:49.052 --> 00:13:51.453]  How great it is in world government is the military.
[00:13:53.295 --> 00:13:56.777]  And that's why Google said, we're not helping the US military do anything.
[00:13:57.698 --> 00:13:59.379]  We're not going to help you with autonomous systems.
[00:13:59.399 --> 00:14:00.560]  We're not going to help you with anything.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.743]  Instead, they announced that they're doing all of their AI work.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.641]  In China.
[00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:10.322]  Especially from Google.
[00:14:11.943 --> 00:14:15.725]  Google won't renew controversial Pentagon AI project.
[00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:19.928]  But, don't worry.
[00:14:22.229 --> 00:14:27.612]  Opening the Google AI Center in China, and then giving the government all the findings so they can weaponize it.
[00:14:30.614 --> 00:14:31.254]  See how that works?
[00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:35.977]  And I sat there in the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last Wednesday,
[00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:45.950]  And I watched Senator Cotton go, you won't even work with the Pentagon or anybody.
[00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.710]  You won't help us with anything anymore.
[00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:54.012]  And Google won't even come to our meetings because they've already made the deal.
[00:14:55.452 --> 00:14:57.893]  And Trump doesn't have a Justice Department to prosecute him.
[00:14:58.373 --> 00:15:01.794]  The average senator is just a peacock playing golf and acting powerful all day.
[00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:07.215]  And while these guys can't even figure out how their email works, that 60-year-old technology
[00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:20.393]  The technocrats have moved on to China, where they're doing animal-human cloning, you name it, and there's no soul, there's no control, there's no nothing.
[00:15:21.433 --> 00:15:30.476]  Instead, the political parties here are just busy trying to dominate, fly over country, and what they see is wild humans that still own guns and drive around and pick up trucks.
[00:15:31.536 --> 00:15:34.897]  They're just kind of threatened by the memory that there might have been some men.
[00:15:36.137 --> 00:15:38.998]  There might have been some people that would stand up to them.
[00:15:40.697 --> 00:16:00.076]  And so that's how dire the straits are, that we can't even get the average American to care that the biggest mass murderers in the world have merged with our government, are trying to destroy our prosperity, and that Trump valiantly comes in, fights for the wheel of state, gets us righted, and then the establishment's mad that we're coming back from the dead, and then I'm being completely shut down.
[00:16:05.163 --> 00:16:20.491]  This is part of a larger push from conservatives, where they allege that these social media companies have bias against conservatives, and it's very similar, I think, what you see them doing with the media, where they say that these powerful entities are pushing a supposed liberal bias on consumers.
[00:16:21.231 --> 00:16:32.917]  There isn't really anything there in most of the instances that they point to, but it's part of a larger agenda, and it's really a political issue that they're using to whip up the conservative base, excite the conservative base for the midterms.
[00:16:33.317 --> 00:16:41.501]  Look at this right here, the guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong, there's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[00:16:41.862 --> 00:16:43.903]  You are incredibly shameful.
[00:16:43.943 --> 00:16:44.683]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.384]  You're just a, look at you, look, look, look.
[00:16:46.564 --> 00:16:50.466]  You are literally an anti-American, anti-free speech coward.
[00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:53.848]  You're going to go down to History Books at the Criminal News Network.
[00:16:54.128 --> 00:16:57.250]  This is one of the main, this is one of the main people right here.
[00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:58.530]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.600]  I'm trying to police the internet.
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.841]  I'm trying to shut people down.
[00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:20.622]  And then you think people are so stupid.
[00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:23.224]  I'm seeing it and a week later you say no one's censoring anybody.
[00:17:23.484 --> 00:17:24.605]  No one's pushing for censoring.
[00:17:24.765 --> 00:17:27.567]  And then you say that Trump is the one attacking the press.
[00:17:27.607 --> 00:17:29.028]  But it only does to stand up to your lies.
[00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:30.969]  Just look at this guy's eyes.
[00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:32.690]  He's even more evil looking in person.
[00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.791]  Something to think about the decisions that you made.
[00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:36.813]  You don't even respond because we're just scum.
[00:17:37.073 --> 00:17:39.354]  You sit there sitting there with no viewers, no followers.
[00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.495]  Everyone can't stand you.
[00:17:40.655 --> 00:17:42.236]  And no matter, you can shut everyone down on earth.
[00:17:42.616 --> 00:17:43.257]  No one will like you.
[00:17:44.117 --> 00:17:44.617]  You understand that?
[00:17:44.957 --> 00:17:46.878]  You'll never have billions and billions of fans and followers.
[00:17:47.038 --> 00:17:48.479]  You'll never have people that love you.
[00:17:48.499 --> 00:17:51.060]  Do you have anything else you'd like to say, Alex?
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:56.482]  You are a dishonorable liar who would never even dare have me on your little tiny shows when you and Stelker called me a virus.
[00:17:56.702 --> 00:17:59.443]  You are a virus to America and freedom.
[00:17:59.503 --> 00:18:01.124]  You are authoritarianism.
[00:18:02.184 --> 00:18:04.166]  Just look in those eyes.
[00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:06.047]  The hunger to silence America.
[00:18:06.107 --> 00:18:08.009]  The hunger to extinguish the First Amendment.
[00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:09.270]  The hunger to deceive.
[00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:13.033]  But he can't do it because the fire of liberty is not going to be knocked out.
[00:18:13.193 --> 00:18:14.634]  You're the definition of a fraud.
[00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:18.397]  You are a charlatan that goes around lying about people to destroy the First Amendment.
[00:18:18.417 --> 00:18:19.618]  I haven't lied about anyone, Alex.
[00:18:19.638 --> 00:18:21.259]  Yes, you are a congenital liar.
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.521]  CNN is a giant fraud that hated the world over.
[00:18:25.883 --> 00:18:26.803]  None of what you're saying is true?
[00:18:26.823 --> 00:18:27.504]  That's not true.
[00:18:27.524 --> 00:18:27.944]  That's not true.
[00:18:27.964 --> 00:18:28.445]  That's not true.
[00:18:28.485 --> 00:18:28.985]  That's not true.
[00:18:48.442 --> 00:18:49.743]  Listen, everybody knows who you are.
[00:18:50.743 --> 00:18:56.267]  Look, as you and Stelter get force-fed by Twitter, we get like a hundred retweets, because CNN's a joke.
[00:18:56.307 --> 00:18:57.547]  CNN's like government cheese.
[00:18:58.468 --> 00:19:00.369]  It literally is just force-fed to everyone everywhere.
[00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:01.149]  Everyone's sick of it.
[00:19:01.189 --> 00:19:03.891]  It's one of the main pretenders in this whole operation.
[00:19:03.911 --> 00:19:07.293]  You don't think we don't know about Obama's countering disinformation propaganda?
[00:19:08.694 --> 00:19:10.655]  You don't think all that's going to come out who's funding this?
[00:19:12.196 --> 00:19:13.877]  And your little ID card and all the rest of it?
[00:19:13.917 --> 00:19:14.637]  You think we're stupid?
[00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:15.838]  You think, uh,
[00:19:16.817 --> 00:19:17.757]  You think we're playing games, huh?
[00:19:17.777 --> 00:19:19.819]  You think we don't know a thing or two, son?
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.080]  Yeah.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.981]  That's illegal, what Obama set up.
[00:19:25.582 --> 00:19:26.862]  It's all going to come down.
[00:19:27.483 --> 00:19:39.109]  You think because you've got some Democrats and some committees and some stay-behind networks, like the 37 angry Democrats in the Justice Department trying to shut down Trump, you think because you've got a rogue group operating inside those agencies that you're going to be able to shut down the free press in America?
[00:19:39.309 --> 00:19:39.709]  We are here.
[00:19:39.749 --> 00:19:40.649]  Paul Revere is here.
[00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:43.191]  The American people are watching, and they're not going to let you win.
[00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:45.612]  You called for us to be the platform.
[00:19:45.752 --> 00:19:46.552]  You pushed it.
[00:19:46.592 --> 00:19:47.692]  Now you say it's not even happening.
[00:19:47.712 --> 00:19:48.553]  It is true.
[00:19:48.573 --> 00:19:49.653]  CNN lobbied for it.
[00:19:49.693 --> 00:19:52.354]  That's all CNN did was call for me to be taken off here.
[00:19:52.754 --> 00:19:53.654]  That's all you've done.
[00:19:53.674 --> 00:19:55.095]  That's what you said needs to be taken down.
[00:19:55.355 --> 00:19:56.215]  Why aren't you taking it down?
[00:19:56.936 --> 00:20:00.477]  If I could rig the playing field and shut everybody else down, I might be a real boy someday.
[00:20:06.439 --> 00:20:09.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:17.463 --> 00:20:21.505]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:20:24.046 --> 00:20:28.049]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:35.572 --> 00:20:44.077]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:59.425]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live September 10th, 2018 global transmission.
[00:21:03.548 --> 00:21:17.498]  Communist China developed a plan with Western robber baron elites more than 50 years ago to consolidate global power over the planet and abolish
[00:21:19.113 --> 00:21:21.213]  The nation-state once and for all.
[00:21:22.334 --> 00:21:29.515]  Apple, Google, and other major tech companies have officially moved to Communist China and are now engaged.
[00:21:32.576 --> 00:21:36.217]  21st century, 6th generation warfare against our country.
[00:21:39.957 --> 00:21:43.898]  Our nation is being overtaken.
[00:21:44.078 --> 00:21:45.858]  Our nation is being consolidated.
[00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:48.219]  Our nation is being sabotaged.
[00:21:49.781 --> 00:22:03.110]  And all of the authoritarianism that you see visited upon the poor slaves of China is now being developed and prepared and beta tested there to be brought here.
[00:22:05.933 --> 00:22:20.045]  The unpersonning, the deplatforming of an individual off of every major digital system is the Chinese model of the digital death penalty if you don't submit to the bureaucrats and whatever their latest brainwashing is.
[00:22:20.846 --> 00:22:22.888]  Do you understand the magnitude of that?
[00:22:26.371 --> 00:22:28.833]  Now here's the big takeaway and what needs to be done.
[00:22:36.465 --> 00:22:41.849]  We need Congress and we need the President to get informed on this and informed on this quickly.
[00:22:43.811 --> 00:23:03.226]  Because the intelligence committees and even the military and the President and others are decades behind where Silicon Valley and the Communist Chinese are in their thinking and understanding of bringing in a ubiquitous system that controls commerce, that controls information,
[00:23:04.434 --> 00:23:20.047]  that controls movement of people, that is a giant AI global membrane, and that when the first true AI system gets plugged into that, it will, in rapid succession, take it over.
[00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:24.871]  So there is a global race for AI.
[00:23:26.388 --> 00:23:31.369]  Everything is being established to be controlled by AI and be autonomous.
[00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:37.071]  So when Elon Musk writes an article or goes on Joe Rogan's podcast, he just keeps saying AI is dangerous.
[00:23:37.151 --> 00:23:38.672]  It takes humans out of the decisions.
[00:23:39.132 --> 00:23:39.892]  It could take over.
[00:23:39.932 --> 00:23:41.092]  It could do really bad things.
[00:23:41.352 --> 00:23:42.453]  Stephen Hawking said that.
[00:23:42.493 --> 00:23:49.915]  But we're already under artificially intelligent automated systems that censor Google and Twitter and Facebook.
[00:23:51.155 --> 00:23:53.616]  We're already living under digital minders.
[00:23:55.256 --> 00:23:58.778]  And China already has a system called Skynet.
[00:23:59.658 --> 00:24:04.341]  That's their social credit score that's being deployed here.
[00:24:06.742 --> 00:24:15.567]  The first place that ever reported the Chinese communist social score plan was Infowars.com.
[00:24:16.848 --> 00:24:19.729]  It was in Chinese newspapers at the time.
[00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:22.631]  Paul Watson was still married to a Chinese woman.
[00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:24.632]  They got divorced right after that.
[00:24:26.338 --> 00:24:30.501]  And her family was in the Chinese government.
[00:24:30.641 --> 00:24:31.482]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:24:33.764 --> 00:24:35.685]  And so, Paul learned about it.
[00:24:38.688 --> 00:24:53.119]  Now, here we are today, and the Pentagon and the CIA, the people that aren't traitors in there, thought they had control of Silicon Valley.
[00:24:54.286 --> 00:24:56.247]  Silicon Valley has already moved to China.
[00:25:01.708 --> 00:25:14.251]  And when they're told we're not going to testify in Congress, the head of Google, and we're not going to work with the Pentagon, what does that tell you?
[00:25:16.252 --> 00:25:20.133]  What does it tell you when they say, but we are going to work with the Chinese military?
[00:25:23.086 --> 00:25:25.188]  And when you work with them, it's all given to them.
[00:25:25.248 --> 00:25:29.092]  And Apple has officially moved there and given them all of your Apple IDs.
[00:25:30.793 --> 00:25:34.277]  So, yeah, you think Tim Cook will show up in Congress as he's asked?
[00:25:36.419 --> 00:25:40.183]  He just meets with Senator Warner and that CIA office Obama set up.
[00:25:42.685 --> 00:25:43.346]  They don't care.
[00:25:44.445 --> 00:25:49.989]  When I talked to Oliver Darcy of CNN, I said, yeah, you're part of that CIA operation of bringing leftist media in to run it.
[00:25:50.449 --> 00:25:51.150]  And the government funded it.
[00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:53.632]  He was just smiling and looking at me, nodding his head.
[00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:57.575]  That's the power trip, is you've got a government divided against itself.
[00:25:57.955 --> 00:26:02.458]  You've got Democrat mutinies going on inside the White House, inside these agencies.
[00:26:02.939 --> 00:26:08.643]  And you have big corporate Silicon Valley wedded to China, because they can do anything they want there and be tax exempt.
[00:26:09.263 --> 00:26:10.985]  You've got the left trained to hate America.
[00:26:12.984 --> 00:26:17.309]  It'll literally be psychologically programmed, like attack dogs, to want its blood.
[00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.632]  You've got Congress not knowing half of what's going on.
[00:26:20.652 --> 00:26:25.197]  And you've got mainstream dinosaur media dying.
[00:26:25.658 --> 00:26:26.799]  It's big tech killing them.
[00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:30.683]  And they think if they join with it, they'll be protected.
[00:26:30.903 --> 00:26:32.365]  But you notice their final job
[00:26:34.502 --> 00:26:46.589]  Are being suicide political kamikazes to go in and be the quote fact checkers who are given the magic wand to say what's real news and what isn't and who can be up and who can't and what's bullying and what isn't.
[00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:55.215]  So the New York Times and CNN and all of them now are admittedly in this Pentagon CIA office that Obama set up.
[00:26:56.644 --> 00:27:21.848]  It gave the green light now for Google and Apple to move to China, and nothing's being done because the media is controlled by a breakaway group run by Obama and Hillary still, with big tech censoring millions and millions of conservatives and patriots, shutting everybody down, engaged in social engineering, engaged in massive manipulation of everybody,
[00:27:25.322 --> 00:27:43.273]  And we're sitting here in the middle of a 21st century, sixth generational war, run by big tech, the Democrats, a bunch of traitors in old media, and the communist Chinese funding it and running it, who own our debt and are taking over our infrastructure and our colleges and everything.
[00:27:44.854 --> 00:27:46.095]  And they're totally ruthless.
[00:27:46.815 --> 00:27:50.097]  They're five times worse than Hitler, if you count number of dead.
[00:27:50.938 --> 00:27:52.239]  They are totally soulless.
[00:27:53.854 --> 00:28:01.420]  Chinese Communist, and Trump comes in and barely gets the wheel away from him, and things come back from the dead.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:18.673]  But he's surrounded, and they're sticking sticky notes on his back, calling him an idiot, and putting stuff above his door, saying that it's crazy town to manipulate him to get angry, so they can say, oh, Trump has a crisis,
[00:28:20.834 --> 00:28:24.197]  Trump is in a crisis of not being able to run his own White House.
[00:28:24.257 --> 00:28:29.341]  No, we have enemies in there trying to overthrow him, trying to sabotage his agenda and bragging about it.
[00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:33.264]  But don't worry, with Trump in crisis, Pence waits in his shadow.
[00:28:34.125 --> 00:28:36.547]  Where'd you hear a year and a half ago they'd do the 25th Amendment on Trump?
[00:28:38.188 --> 00:28:38.509]  You see?
[00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:40.791]  You see how that works?
[00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:42.756]  You see how this is going?
[00:28:43.557 --> 00:28:44.378]  They're making their move.
[00:28:44.398 --> 00:28:46.060]  Because we dare have a real president.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.301]  And that's the big issue.
[00:28:47.361 --> 00:28:50.345]  And wouldn't Americans stand with America against the CHICOMS?
[00:28:50.745 --> 00:28:52.247]  Wouldn't you stand for your own prosperity?
[00:28:52.927 --> 00:28:53.108]  No!
[00:28:54.149 --> 00:29:00.396]  Because people through peer pressure online are trained to hate Trump and hate me and watch their whole future go down in flames.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.984]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[00:29:06.084 --> 00:29:14.296]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:29:14.756 --> 00:29:17.240]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.722]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:29:19.062 --> 00:29:20.964]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:29:21.224 --> 00:29:23.307]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:24.648]  This is all confirmed.
[00:29:24.668 --> 00:29:25.609]  This is not a drill.
[00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:29.693]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:29:30.033 --> 00:29:31.455]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:29:31.575 --> 00:29:32.056]  Apple 100%.
[00:29:32.456 --> 00:29:38.082]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:29:38.522 --> 00:29:43.286]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:29:43.586 --> 00:29:44.447]  This is happening.
[00:29:44.467 --> 00:29:52.414]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:29:52.514 --> 00:29:58.459]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:29:58.859 --> 00:30:06.826]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:30:07.686 --> 00:30:11.248]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:14.730]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:30:15.051 --> 00:30:22.055]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:30:22.295 --> 00:30:24.957]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:30:25.317 --> 00:30:30.240]  Total Internet of Things integration global social score complete command and control system.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:32.161]  It is the virtual reality AI
[00:30:32.261 --> 00:30:33.161]  We're good to go.
[00:30:52.811 --> 00:31:01.540]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:06.425]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:31:06.846 --> 00:31:11.731]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:31:12.031 --> 00:31:19.736]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:31:20.257 --> 00:31:27.001]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:32.805]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:31:33.025 --> 00:31:37.749]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:39.830]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:40.911]  Now break free!
[00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:53.321]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:31:53.922 --> 00:31:56.604]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:31:56.705 --> 00:32:00.629]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:32:02.867 --> 00:32:04.809]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:11.477]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[00:32:11.838 --> 00:32:15.823]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[00:32:16.323 --> 00:32:22.311]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[00:32:22.791 --> 00:32:28.836]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[00:32:29.276 --> 00:32:40.786]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[00:32:41.266 --> 00:32:50.534]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:54.855]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[00:32:55.435 --> 00:33:00.176]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:33:06.398 --> 00:33:09.099]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.786 --> 00:33:28.495]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:33:28.836 --> 00:33:33.048]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:37.145 --> 00:33:47.936]  So Google won't work with the Pentagon on artificial intelligence, but it's officially moved its main operations for AI to China, and is merging with the Chinese government, letting them have all the technology.
[00:33:48.296 --> 00:33:48.716]  That's right.
[00:33:49.177 --> 00:33:52.020]  Apple has officially moved to China to enjoy tax exemption.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:56.063]  But the left here says that Trump's 15% tax on corporations is too low.
[00:33:56.784 --> 00:33:59.045]  It's all part of the economic war against this country.
[00:33:59.625 --> 00:34:12.149]  It's 21st century, six-generational warfare with the big mega-banks, Silicon Valley, the Hollywood crowd, the unelected EU, and the chi-coms trying to break the back of the American system.
[00:34:12.509 --> 00:34:13.069]  It's treason!
[00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.110]  And it's time for the American people to wake up.
[00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:23.313]  The good news is, I was in Congress last week, and they were discussing the fact that Google and Apple and others have turned against the United States.
[00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:34.000]  We built the internet, we built these companies, the CIA, the NSA funded them, but Congress, and yes, even the President, have been weak so far in taking action.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:41.364]  I was told by high-level sources over the weekend, and then told by some other mid-level sources in the White House,
[00:34:42.304 --> 00:34:57.994]  That indeed, Trump's a few weeks behind on executive orders, cracking down on the censorship and the espionage, but that his own staff has been sabotaging and hamstringing him, something that we first broke over a year ago, that is now, again, proven to be accurate.
[00:34:58.335 --> 00:35:02.037]  That's why InfoWars is next year's news, today.
[00:35:03.458 --> 00:35:05.079]  Now, look at this article.
[00:35:09.342 --> 00:35:10.943]  The Week in Tech.
[00:35:13.075 --> 00:35:17.177]  Infowars and China's great firewall.
[00:35:18.857 --> 00:35:22.099]  And they admit China has a firewall to control their dissidents.
[00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:23.619]  Now America does.
[00:35:23.819 --> 00:35:24.660]  New York Times.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:26.180]  And they report on it.
[00:35:27.481 --> 00:35:29.622]  Like, is it a good idea that we're going to be like China?
[00:35:29.642 --> 00:35:31.843]  Remember just a year and a half ago?
[00:35:33.583 --> 00:35:39.846]  The Chinese dictator was praising US media and the government for, quote, cracking down on fake news.
[00:35:40.946 --> 00:35:41.907]  That means news.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.541]  That the government disagrees with.
[00:35:46.582 --> 00:35:49.945]  And Google and Apple help round up their political dissidents over there.
[00:35:50.405 --> 00:35:53.467]  That tells you they'll do that here if they can get away with it.
[00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:59.532]  That tells you that they are incredible authoritarians.
[00:36:00.552 --> 00:36:07.297]  Now, we'll see if the president takes action.
[00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:08.078]  He said he will.
[00:36:09.439 --> 00:36:12.021]  Really, there's no action that could be too strong
[00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:43.181]  When you have a country that's open and free and you bring in an authoritarian regime to help it buy up the debt, take control of the infrastructure, take control of the universities, buy up Hollywood, and then brainwash through the media the public to hate their president, to hate patriots that stand up for the truth like myself, and to side with the multinational gutting of this country when it even hurts the idiots that lowered the drawbridge and let the dragon in.
[00:36:44.189 --> 00:36:44.769]  Pun intended.
[00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:53.653]  But their identity in America with the left, as has been recorded and proven, is hating the country.
[00:36:54.394 --> 00:36:55.254]  Hating themselves.
[00:36:55.794 --> 00:36:56.835]  Hating prosperity.
[00:36:56.875 --> 00:37:10.681]  Because the image of 57 Chevys, Marilyn Monroe, Muhammad Ali, Roger Staubach, all that makes people feel small.
[00:37:12.577 --> 00:37:21.643]  And so the authoritarianism of China, well they've been raised in the universities and government bureaucracies that that's a good thing because they'll be in charge of something like that.
[00:37:22.944 --> 00:37:29.049]  And so they're imagining that grass that's green on the other side even though it's a wasteland on the other side.
[00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.091]  Now we come back in the next segment.
[00:37:34.973 --> 00:37:39.456]  Just when I thought it was sickening video on Friday of Obama taking credit
[00:37:41.223 --> 00:37:44.546]  For Trump, he completely did it, as you know, this weekend.
[00:37:46.187 --> 00:37:55.634]  And then, when Chris Tonto-Piranto, one of the heroes of Benghazi, frequent guest here, coming on the next few days, tweeted and said, how dare you?
[00:37:55.674 --> 00:37:59.477]  You ordered a stab down, my friends got killed, and now you say it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:38:00.858 --> 00:38:01.458]  Twitter banned him.
[00:38:02.219 --> 00:38:02.699]  Suspended him.
[00:38:04.821 --> 00:38:07.263]  Because you can't talk back
[00:38:10.168 --> 00:38:11.168]  To a protected group.
[00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.291]  That's what Apple said when they banned me on Friday from the app.
[00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:20.932]  A new level of tortious interference.
[00:38:20.952 --> 00:38:23.733]  A new level of monopoly.
[00:38:23.753 --> 00:38:26.134]  A new level of I paid for that app through the App Store.
[00:38:26.234 --> 00:38:27.914]  Paid for it to be reviewed and accepted.
[00:38:28.975 --> 00:38:29.875]  Had five stars.
[00:38:30.655 --> 00:38:31.856]  Number one app in news.
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:37.123]  And so they just got rid of it after two million downloads in five weeks.
[00:38:37.743 --> 00:38:39.144]  Now, if you have it on your phone, you still have it.
[00:38:39.445 --> 00:38:41.426]  You can still get the Google Play for now.
[00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.529]  I'm sure they'll file a suit and remove it so you can't get it.
[00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:46.771]  We haven't been removed from Google yet.
[00:38:48.592 --> 00:38:50.694]  And by the way, lawyers tell me, no, you sue, you'll win.
[00:38:50.734 --> 00:38:52.476]  But these are trillion dollar companies apiece.
[00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:54.037]  It'll take years to do.
[00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:56.939]  And by the time I win that, we won't be in America anyways.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.002]  Because that's what I'm going to cover next hour.
[00:39:04.807 --> 00:39:14.051]  And it ties into the Chinese communist move and how the globalists are allied with it and how they use that as a safe base, a safe harbor to go back and forth and commit criminal actions.
[00:39:14.892 --> 00:39:19.434]  And use the Chinese government and its corporations as cover to commit those acts.
[00:39:20.054 --> 00:39:27.678]  You always hear about folks that run back and forth between the US and Israel because Israel doesn't have extradition and they can commit crimes and that goes on.
[00:39:27.738 --> 00:39:31.540]  Well, China's got how much bigger of a population, more money?
[00:39:32.947 --> 00:39:44.053]  But again, there's a meme on the internet, a bot on YouTube and everywhere, that when I talk about China, and now it's the big threat, that I'm a Mossad agent and a traitor.
[00:39:44.273 --> 00:39:47.734]  I have nothing to do with Israel, the Mossad, I've never been to Israel.
[00:39:48.015 --> 00:39:48.935]  I'm not against Israel.
[00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:51.857]  If you let the Muslims take it over, they'd be killing each other forever over it.
[00:39:52.517 --> 00:39:53.457]  Why can't Israel exist?
[00:39:53.537 --> 00:39:54.498]  I'm not out to get Israel.
[00:39:55.118 --> 00:39:58.100]  I don't like the leftist pro-Israel lobby that's anti-gun.
[00:39:58.925 --> 00:40:02.287]  And that lobby attacks me constantly, the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL.
[00:40:02.327 --> 00:40:07.810]  But the meme is, quit covering up for Israel, Alex.
[00:40:09.071 --> 00:40:11.252]  That's the mental illness online of the traitors.
[00:40:11.653 --> 00:40:15.615]  And then weak-minded people buy into that, the whole QAnon thing that's fraudulent.
[00:40:16.015 --> 00:40:20.378]  And I'm not saying you're bad if you like that or whatever, but Mueller's a great guy, Alex is bad.
[00:40:20.658 --> 00:40:22.459]  They're going to ship everybody to Gitmo.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.561]  China's not the threat, it's Israel.
[00:40:26.221 --> 00:40:26.502]  Whoa.
[00:40:27.262 --> 00:40:28.163]  That is crazy.
[00:40:29.003 --> 00:40:31.785]  Israel has sold a lot of weapons to China, and that is treasonous.
[00:40:32.265 --> 00:40:33.686]  A lot of stuff we give them, they sell.
[00:40:33.986 --> 00:40:34.647]  So does our government.
[00:40:34.707 --> 00:40:35.087]  It's wrong.
[00:40:35.127 --> 00:40:38.509]  But it's this mental illness at the end of the day.
[00:40:38.609 --> 00:40:40.210]  You watch, Mueller's coming for Trump.
[00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:47.895]  But see, people want to be delusional and think everything's okay, everything's fine, because they can't deal with the crisis we're in.
[00:40:48.415 --> 00:40:54.599]  They've got to say some anonymous guy on 4chan named QAnon says everything's fine, so we can all go back to sleep.
[00:40:55.359 --> 00:40:56.340]  Stick with the plan!
[00:40:57.213 --> 00:40:57.633]  They say.
[00:41:02.197 --> 00:41:04.618]  Well, Alex woke me up, but he's bad now.
[00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:06.780]  Those are PSYOP operations.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.921]  I'm being sued by the Democrats.
[00:41:08.941 --> 00:41:10.082]  They're trying to shut me down.
[00:41:10.322 --> 00:41:11.383]  We're under total attack.
[00:41:11.423 --> 00:41:12.224]  We need your prayers.
[00:41:12.584 --> 00:41:13.385]  We need your support.
[00:41:15.366 --> 00:41:19.509]  I'm going to get into the fact that they're definitely planting a false flag against Infowars.
[00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.693]  By the way, Mike Adams has an article in a powerful video that I think I asked Paul to post this morning.
[00:41:27.116 --> 00:41:28.037]  I guess you guys can do that.
[00:41:29.798 --> 00:41:31.940]  Dealing with the fact that they're preparing a false flag against us.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:33.481]  There's no doubt it's an emergency alert.
[00:41:33.501 --> 00:41:34.181]  It's very powerful.
[00:41:34.481 --> 00:41:35.182]  People should see that.
[00:41:35.202 --> 00:41:37.984]  We're going to post it to InfoWars.com as well.
[00:41:38.564 --> 00:41:40.806]  Can't tweet it out, so it's up to you guys to tweet it out.
[00:41:41.486 --> 00:41:48.892]  And then just briefly, we won't be here if you don't financially support us.
[00:41:49.152 --> 00:41:51.794]  And you have been financially supporting us.
[00:41:51.874 --> 00:41:54.356]  In fact, you have increased the amount of purchases you're making.
[00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:56.794]  But it's like a seawall.
[00:41:57.674 --> 00:41:59.656]  Yes, we're bringing in the most money we've ever brought in.
[00:42:01.477 --> 00:42:05.860]  But we're spending more money than we ever have under all these attacks.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:15.867]  And if things don't just increase 5%, if they increase 20-30%, we can definitely expand and stop the globalists and not let them shut us down.
[00:42:16.857 --> 00:42:19.079]  But more and more I realize that they're running out the clock.
[00:42:19.439 --> 00:42:22.021]  They're going to plan something before the midterms.
[00:42:22.681 --> 00:42:24.642]  The country's coming back too strong.
[00:42:24.902 --> 00:42:25.643]  They're panicking.
[00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:31.087]  And I just want to be effective in what could be the final days of Infowars.
[00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:33.320]  I mean, really, I'm not scared.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.821]  I understand what we're up against.
[00:42:35.301 --> 00:42:37.963]  And I understand the consequences if we don't defeat this.
[00:42:37.983 --> 00:42:40.786]  I just want everybody to know how serious this is for you and your family.
[00:42:41.146 --> 00:42:42.467]  Because you're right here next to us.
[00:42:43.528 --> 00:42:47.571]  This is a full assault, 21st century, 6th generation warfare against America.
[00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:49.492]  So, we're under attack.
[00:42:49.532 --> 00:42:50.653]  The United States is under attack.
[00:42:51.473 --> 00:42:52.594]  Your families are under attack.
[00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:54.075]  Christianity is under attack.
[00:42:54.876 --> 00:42:58.459]  And we need your financial support at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:58.479 --> 00:43:00.580]  We've got some big sales that have got to end today.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:01.301]  They've got to end today.
[00:43:02.483 --> 00:43:06.666]  Well, I'm here in the Infowars bunker, and I'm coming to you from one of our new studios.
[00:43:08.327 --> 00:43:13.450]  We've gained hundreds of new affiliates last month, but my God, Soros and the Communist Chinese are coming down on us hard.
[00:43:14.451 --> 00:43:18.994]  And, you know, I see Google and Facebook and Apple especially moving to China and helping suppress their people.
[00:43:20.255 --> 00:43:20.855]  It freaks me out.
[00:43:21.676 --> 00:43:24.858]  Because China has killed five times the number of people that Adolf Hitler did.
[00:43:25.819 --> 00:43:30.562]  But, oh, because they're Chinese, it's okay, because media taught us only white people can do that stuff.
[00:43:31.783 --> 00:43:37.526]  It freaks me out to see all these big tech companies saying, let's just ban Trump supporters, period.
[00:43:37.826 --> 00:43:39.507]  Let's ban all Alex Jones supporters.
[00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:41.668]  They're putting us in a digital gulag.
[00:43:41.708 --> 00:43:45.130]  But the good news is humanity is fighting back.
[00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:47.171]  And that's why I'm coming to you from this new studio.
[00:43:48.416 --> 00:43:53.938]  That we're building is one of the most state-of-the-art in the country to transmit the truth worldwide to the people.
[00:43:54.678 --> 00:43:55.819]  We've got big plans.
[00:43:56.419 --> 00:44:01.561]  That's why I'm asking all of you, however you can support or whatever you can do, we are all in this together.
[00:44:01.901 --> 00:44:02.962]  Look at this studio.
[00:44:03.362 --> 00:44:04.262]  Look at what we're doing.
[00:44:04.582 --> 00:44:05.643]  Look at the crew we're hiring.
[00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.223]  Look at all the things that are happening.
[00:44:07.763 --> 00:44:08.164]  It's epic.
[00:44:09.504 --> 00:44:11.705]  And then, take these products right here.
[00:44:13.373 --> 00:44:16.014]  We have the best fish oil for adults and children.
[00:44:16.334 --> 00:44:19.875]  We have the best CoQ10 and PQQ.
[00:44:19.935 --> 00:44:22.156]  We have the best bone broth.
[00:44:22.196 --> 00:44:22.636]  It's all there.
[00:44:23.597 --> 00:44:28.598]  You get these products, you get things that help you and your body and your family, and they help fund the information war.
[00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:30.239]  And these sales are going to end this week.
[00:44:31.219 --> 00:44:32.940]  So I commend you, I salute you, I thank you.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.341]  But take advantage of these sales right now.
[00:44:35.361 --> 00:44:36.821]  Some of the biggest ever.
[00:44:36.841 --> 00:44:38.622]  50% off on many of these products.
[00:44:38.982 --> 00:44:40.363]  Free shipping on many of the items.
[00:44:40.383 --> 00:44:40.803]  You name it.
[00:44:41.738 --> 00:44:42.779]  And we'll be able to move forward.
[00:44:43.699 --> 00:44:46.641]  Quite frankly, it's crazy how this stuff works.
[00:44:46.701 --> 00:44:50.504]  Because every attack they launch, you bring in just enough support to counter it.
[00:44:51.224 --> 00:44:53.005]  Then they attack again, just enough support.
[00:44:53.526 --> 00:44:58.329]  You know, the Patriot in me wants to see us way up here to feel confident, but that's not how God works.
[00:44:59.109 --> 00:45:03.792]  It's you that keep hanging with us, and making the decision to support us, that as they double down, you double down.
[00:45:04.093 --> 00:45:06.074]  As they attack, you move back against them.
[00:45:07.352 --> 00:45:08.293]  It's an amazing time.
[00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:09.314]  The products are great.
[00:45:09.514 --> 00:45:10.355]  The t-shirts are great.
[00:45:10.395 --> 00:45:11.055]  The books are great.
[00:45:11.175 --> 00:45:11.996]  All the material is great.
[00:45:12.336 --> 00:45:13.217]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:13.497 --> 00:45:18.122]  Without you, we're not going to be able to launch this and counter these jerks.
[00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:22.726]  Without you, they're going to use us as the template, the blueprint, to shut all of you down.
[00:45:23.615 --> 00:45:35.486]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, I want to commend you for what you've done, and I want to encourage you now, more than ever, to think about what you're doing in history, and the fact that you've already committed so much to freedom, you've already seen so many good things happen.
[00:45:36.107 --> 00:45:39.730]  Now's the time to double down against these jerks, the New York Times, and CNN.
[00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:47.633]  And the jerks over at the Washington Post, and the Chi-Com murderers, and the scum in Hollywood, we're standing against them and we're delivering.
[00:45:48.133 --> 00:45:51.955]  And the economy's coming back, and people are coming together, but they're counter-striking.
[00:45:52.335 --> 00:45:55.636]  And without you standing with us, we will be shut down.
[00:45:56.416 --> 00:46:04.879]  They want to demoralize you, they want to tell you you're weak, they want to say we're losing in the face of this attack, because they want you to think your support didn't do jack squat!
[00:46:05.936 --> 00:46:09.104]  Your support has taken us to the most traffic InfoWars has ever gotten.
[00:46:09.585 --> 00:46:11.189]  And has brought in the most money we've ever gotten.
[00:46:12.272 --> 00:46:12.973]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:46:13.996 --> 00:46:16.539]  Until they banned us, we were losing money for six, seven months.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.383]  Because people thought everything was fine and, you know, Trump was there and everything was okay.
[00:46:21.244 --> 00:46:23.486]  And so we're still behind for the year of what we need to expand.
[00:46:23.947 --> 00:46:24.827]  We might even contract.
[00:46:25.268 --> 00:46:30.734]  But with current numbers, it looks like we're going to be able to launch the expansion and the satellites and everything thanks to you!
[00:46:31.334 --> 00:46:32.475]  But it's up to you right now!
[00:46:33.356 --> 00:46:36.340]  My fighting spirit's never been stronger because I can feel the enemies about to bring it.
[00:46:37.389 --> 00:46:38.029]  To their next level.
[00:46:38.049 --> 00:46:39.730]  But we're going to bring it to our next level as well.
[00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.671]  So I'm counting on you right now and I love you and I appreciate you.
[00:46:43.052 --> 00:46:48.034]  So whatever you do, however you do it, legally and lawfully, get the word out and support InfoWars.
[00:46:48.334 --> 00:46:49.995]  It's symbiotic, it supports you as well.
[00:46:50.575 --> 00:46:51.335]  I thank you again.
[00:46:51.355 --> 00:46:55.197]  This is quite an epic time of your life.
[00:46:55.217 --> 00:46:56.958]  60 days out from the election right now.
[00:46:58.799 --> 00:46:59.739]  History's happening right now.
[00:47:00.539 --> 00:47:01.440]  What are you going to do right now?
[00:47:05.899 --> 00:47:12.123]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.646 --> 00:47:19.167]  We are on the march.
[00:47:19.507 --> 00:47:21.949]  The empire is on the run.
[00:47:22.669 --> 00:47:26.392]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.601]  What have I been saying for several years?
[00:47:30.721 --> 00:47:43.130]  I've said that the European Union is using draconian regulations that they don't enforce against China to sue US corporations for the EU to bring in total censorship and control.
[00:47:44.631 --> 00:47:51.856]  Well, now we've got all the major news articles here, IBC, you name it.
[00:47:53.379 --> 00:47:57.962]  Coming out, France takes Google to court to control content globally.
[00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:05.147]  See, I actually study and then I come up with original ideas.
[00:48:07.429 --> 00:48:09.410]  I don't just go off what the news says.
[00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.612]  I read an article and I see things other people don't see.
[00:48:15.254 --> 00:48:18.136]  It's not the EU and France.
[00:48:20.814 --> 00:48:22.055]  Trying to stop hate speech.
[00:48:22.155 --> 00:48:24.397]  It's them taking control of our free speech.
[00:48:25.578 --> 00:48:27.219]  You're like, yeah, I know that's common sense.
[00:48:27.299 --> 00:48:27.700]  Exactly.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:31.563]  But people, I've noticed, don't read news like that.
[00:48:31.923 --> 00:48:33.344]  They just go, it is hate.
[00:48:33.905 --> 00:48:35.406]  We must let the EU run us.
[00:48:35.906 --> 00:48:36.226]  No!
[00:48:37.147 --> 00:48:38.428]  The EU's not elected!
[00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:42.872]  How did it get 25 countries into it?
[00:48:42.912 --> 00:48:43.933]  None of them ever had a vote.
[00:48:44.113 --> 00:48:46.094]  England finally had a vote and said, we're getting out.
[00:48:47.355 --> 00:48:48.816]  Two years ago, have they gotten out?
[00:48:48.877 --> 00:48:49.077]  No!
[00:48:53.905 --> 00:48:57.926]  And then it's run by the grandson of the head Nazi family, the Junkers?
[00:49:00.507 --> 00:49:02.068]  Who doesn't pay taxes in the EU?
[00:49:02.088 --> 00:49:05.609]  Yeah, there's Junker and Soros.
[00:49:05.669 --> 00:49:07.430]  I mean, look at those two!
[00:49:09.851 --> 00:49:10.871]  Lord help us, man!
[00:49:13.132 --> 00:49:13.992]  That's who we're fighting!
[00:49:14.693 --> 00:49:20.615]  But the average trendy, skinny genius like, yeah, screw Alex Jones, screw Trump, fly over country America sucks!
[00:49:21.834 --> 00:49:23.716]  But you don't want to go live in Communist China!
[00:49:25.637 --> 00:49:30.701]  But there's this existential weirdness of like, we're on the winning team, we're with the big corporations.
[00:49:32.683 --> 00:49:38.087]  Can you find out what these mercs are paid at BuzzFeed and stuff, like $40,000 a year, $25,000 a year?
[00:49:38.527 --> 00:49:39.228]  Almost nothing!
[00:49:39.528 --> 00:49:40.189]  To be traitors!
[00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:46.414]  But if they can get someone taken down, then they get a big bonus.
[00:49:47.134 --> 00:49:47.935]  They're not journalists.
[00:49:48.555 --> 00:49:51.458]  They're little secret police crybaby tattletales.
[00:49:55.452 --> 00:50:08.895]  Now the only thing more arrogant than the unelected EU trying to run the internet here is our stupid Congress letting it go on and the fact that Trump just now started to figure this out.
[00:50:10.936 --> 00:50:13.437]  But just imagine these groups at BuzzFeed everywhere.
[00:50:13.497 --> 00:50:18.698]  They love being villains and they all make that mentally ill, soy boy, rat face.
[00:50:19.923 --> 00:50:20.523]  They all do it.
[00:50:21.164 --> 00:50:22.685]  Paul's done videos on the soy boy.
[00:50:23.406 --> 00:50:30.991]  They all do this weird thing where they go, I can't make the face, I was like a... And we can sit here and joke about it all day, but it's not funny.
[00:50:32.372 --> 00:50:41.799]  So the only thing more arrogant than all of this is Obama coming out and taking credit
[00:50:43.277 --> 00:50:52.339]  Last week, for the economy coming back, when he told Trump, you'll never get it above 3%, Paul Krugman of the New York Times Economist said so.
[00:50:52.959 --> 00:50:54.199]  And if he says so, it's so.
[00:50:54.499 --> 00:50:59.960]  They also said 98% chance Hillary would win, with some fake algorithm they had that they pulled out of their rear end.
[00:51:04.281 --> 00:51:08.582]  But now, he's back last week saying, no, no, I take credit, it just had lag time.
[00:51:08.922 --> 00:51:10.322]  Now it got worse yesterday.
[00:51:11.636 --> 00:51:17.142]  He takes credit for recovery, says economic miracle started after he left, but that he triggered it.
[00:51:18.263 --> 00:51:24.569]  And then it's happening despite Trump, when he always said it was impossible.
[00:51:24.629 --> 00:51:28.853]  So he is, again, not just a liar, but insanely arrogant.
[00:51:28.893 --> 00:51:29.434]  Here's the video.
[00:51:30.815 --> 00:51:32.036]  And by the time I left office,
[00:51:33.018 --> 00:51:42.202]  Household income was near its all-time high, and the uninsured rate had hit an all-time low, and wages were rising, and poverty rates were falling.
[00:51:43.362 --> 00:51:51.486]  I mention all this just so when you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:56.541]  None of that's true.
[00:51:57.241 --> 00:52:01.203]  There were all-time people on welfare, all-time food stamps, all-time growth of the debt.
[00:52:01.583 --> 00:52:04.284]  The Federal Reserve printed five trillion plus dollars to try to prop it up.
[00:52:05.665 --> 00:52:08.967]  They've been raising this rate six times since Trump got in, trying to kill the recovery.
[00:52:10.788 --> 00:52:12.588]  And Trump has said, stop it, and they're not going to stop.
[00:52:13.749 --> 00:52:16.791]  So, I mean, if you know what went on, this is total lies!
[00:52:17.911 --> 00:52:18.311]  Continue.
[00:52:22.453 --> 00:52:23.514]  Then he just sits there and smiles.
[00:52:25.782 --> 00:52:27.244]  It's like he lost the football game.
[00:52:27.604 --> 00:52:29.306]  I'm glad it's continued.
[00:52:29.326 --> 00:52:30.007]  Back in 30 seconds.
[00:52:30.027 --> 00:52:31.108]  20 seconds.
[00:52:34.071 --> 00:52:35.693]  He's glad it continued.
[00:52:35.833 --> 00:52:37.275]  It never went above 3%.
[00:52:39.738 --> 00:52:40.779]  When you left, it was like 2.3.
[00:52:42.745 --> 00:52:43.706]  You are a liar!
[00:52:44.686 --> 00:52:48.889]  But he sits there with his con game with a bunch of these weirdos listening to him, and they all clap.
[00:52:48.909 --> 00:52:51.811]  He goes, the sky is red at high noon.
[00:52:52.071 --> 00:52:52.671]  Yay!
[00:52:53.152 --> 00:52:54.893]  Fish do not live in water.
[00:52:54.913 --> 00:52:55.773]  Yay!
[00:52:56.234 --> 00:52:56.954]  Black is white.
[00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:57.795]  Up is down.
[00:52:58.415 --> 00:52:59.636]  Two plus two equals a hundred.
[00:53:02.518 --> 00:53:03.198]  Just go back to it.
[00:53:08.462 --> 00:53:10.323]  I mean, I'm glad it's continued.
[00:53:12.213 --> 00:53:12.693]  Not true.
[00:53:42.225 --> 00:53:42.805]  I digress.
[00:53:44.286 --> 00:53:45.347]  Oh, what a fancy word.
[00:53:46.908 --> 00:53:47.949]  He's so pissed off.
[00:53:48.329 --> 00:53:49.109]  He's so panicked.
[00:53:49.189 --> 00:53:51.871]  The country's coming back.
[00:53:52.131 --> 00:53:56.894]  In 2009, we had new jobs numbers as good as they are now.
[00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.095]  I went and looked it up.
[00:53:59.336 --> 00:53:59.896]  He's a liar.
[00:54:01.157 --> 00:54:02.678]  And it's not with the economic growth.
[00:54:02.738 --> 00:54:03.778]  It's not with the bonuses.
[00:54:03.838 --> 00:54:06.080]  It's not with all the other facts that are there.
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.201]  And it never went above 3%.
[00:54:09.164 --> 00:54:12.247]  And remember, he said it during the campaign.
[00:54:12.487 --> 00:54:15.529]  Here he is with his magic wand statement.
[00:54:18.232 --> 00:54:27.579]  When somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, who I'm not going to advertise for, that he's going to bring all these jobs back.
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.861]  Well, how exactly are you going to do that?
[00:54:29.901 --> 00:54:30.582]  What are you going to do?
[00:54:33.284 --> 00:54:34.185]  There's no answer to it.
[00:54:34.905 --> 00:54:37.568]  He just says, well, I'm going to negotiate a better deal.
[00:54:38.912 --> 00:54:41.393]  What, how exactly are you going to negotiate that?
[00:54:42.453 --> 00:54:43.854]  What magic wand do you have?
[00:54:45.094 --> 00:54:48.315]  And usually the answer is, he doesn't have an answer.
[00:54:49.556 --> 00:54:57.759]  So... Okay, but now, he says the economic miracle started after he left office.
[00:54:59.279 --> 00:55:01.060]  So he's using the terms magic wand, miracle.
[00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.741]  But then he goes further.
[00:55:04.639 --> 00:55:07.401]  He calls Benghazi a conspiracy theory.
[00:55:07.441 --> 00:55:14.645]  Just, oh, the 13-hour stand-down ordered by him and Hillary, all confirmed, it's all come out, congressional testimony, huge scandal.
[00:55:14.966 --> 00:55:16.987]  He just says conspiracy theory.
[00:55:17.027 --> 00:55:18.068]  He's got a magic wand.
[00:55:18.508 --> 00:55:28.234]  Trump's got one called cutting back regulations that are out of control, that are designed to shut down our businesses, cutting taxes, cutting the corporate tax from 40 to 15 to get some jobs back.
[00:55:28.775 --> 00:55:29.695]  China goes to zero.
[00:55:29.715 --> 00:55:30.576]  They know how important that is.
[00:55:32.677 --> 00:55:37.800]  To counter that, they understand that that's a real magic wand.
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.862]  But see, he's got his magic wand.
[00:55:41.063 --> 00:55:41.783]  Obama does.
[00:55:43.844 --> 00:55:47.387]  He's got his magic wand, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:48.167 --> 00:55:56.573]  He can just lie and use a fancy word like conspiracy theory, a fancy term, and just go, Benghazi, conspiracy theory.
[00:55:56.833 --> 00:55:57.994]  Yeah, that didn't happen.
[00:55:58.714 --> 00:56:00.916]  Oh, Alex Jones, he's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:56:01.721 --> 00:56:04.623]  He just keeps being right about everything, so we gotta shut him down.
[00:56:05.784 --> 00:56:08.126]  Let's go to his latest outrage.
[00:56:09.027 --> 00:56:16.372]  This Congress has championed the unwinding of campaign finance laws to give billionaires outside influence over our politics.
[00:56:17.973 --> 00:56:22.797]  Systematically attacked voting rights to make it harder for young people and minorities and the poor to vote.
[00:56:22.937 --> 00:56:23.537]  None of that's true.
[00:56:25.839 --> 00:56:29.342]  Handed out tax cuts without regard to deficits.
[00:56:32.563 --> 00:56:34.444]  Slash the safety net wherever it could.
[00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:39.446]  Cast dozens of votes to take away health insurance from ordinary Americans.
[00:56:41.106 --> 00:56:43.267]  Embraced wild conspiracy theories.
[00:56:45.428 --> 00:56:48.309]  Like those surrounding Benghazi.
[00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:51.350]  Or my birth certificate.
[00:56:54.432 --> 00:56:55.632]  Rejected science.
[00:56:57.353 --> 00:57:00.474]  Rejected facts on things like climate change.
[00:57:03.314 --> 00:57:17.069]  Embraced a rising absolutism from a willingness to default on America's debt by not paying our bills to a refusal to even meet, much less consider,
[00:57:18.007 --> 00:57:21.150]  A qualified nominee for the Supreme Court.
[00:57:21.411 --> 00:57:24.915]  Again, all of this is just pure lies, pure crud, pure garbage.
[00:57:24.995 --> 00:57:26.056]  It's just incredible.
[00:57:26.596 --> 00:57:28.358]  This guy lies worse than the devil.
[00:57:29.159 --> 00:57:31.081]  Please remember InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:57:31.121 --> 00:57:32.703]  Great t-shirts, great books, great films.

[00:57:42.718 --> 00:57:45.405]  Both of them, especially the turmeric, are very close to selling out.
[00:57:45.746 --> 00:57:49.095]  Infowarsstore.com funds the revolution against the globalists.

[00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:56.213]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[00:58:56.493 --> 00:58:59.936]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:59:00.277 --> 00:59:09.806]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double-blind FDA-cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:59:10.306 --> 00:59:10.707]  ...study.
[00:59:11.007 --> 00:59:13.750]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[00:59:14.091 --> 00:59:19.076]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:59:19.116 --> 00:59:21.419]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:59:21.679 --> 00:59:26.284]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:59:26.384 --> 00:59:26.945]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:59:27.345 --> 00:59:31.148]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:59:31.368 --> 00:59:34.030]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:59:34.291 --> 00:59:37.593]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[00:59:37.973 --> 00:59:43.278]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[00:59:43.358 --> 00:59:47.501]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[00:59:48.362 --> 00:59:51.044]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:59:56.988 --> 00:59:59.009]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:59:59.089 --> 01:00:03.672]  You are the resistance.
[01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:14.640]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:30.787]  Now, coming up the next segment, I am going to get into some critical information on the Globalist plan with 57 days left to stage a false flag.
[01:00:31.288 --> 01:00:32.429]  100% they're planning it.
[01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:33.670]  All the signs are there.
[01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.911]  I'll break it down next segment.
[01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:39.015]  Then the head of the walk-away movement is going to be popping into the transmission as well.
[01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:43.218]  But here's everything you need to know about the Infowars ban in two minutes.
[01:00:43.258 --> 01:00:43.579]  Here it is.
[01:00:45.526 --> 01:00:56.192]  Because there is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations and big tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[01:00:56.753 --> 01:01:03.037]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing,
[01:01:03.797 --> 01:01:10.121]  ...to begin shutting down conservatives when the Democrats threatened to federalize Big Tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[01:01:10.341 --> 01:01:16.686]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[01:01:17.146 --> 01:01:21.689]  Mr. Jones, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[01:01:22.049 --> 01:01:23.590]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure.
[01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:23.910]  You're sure?
[01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:24.351]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:24.371 --> 01:01:27.313]  But every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[01:01:27.633 --> 01:01:30.175]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[01:01:30.655 --> 01:01:31.716]  Obama established...
[01:01:32.356 --> 01:01:33.437]  With an executive order.
[01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:39.199]  He established with an executive order before he left office a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[01:01:39.579 --> 01:01:43.721]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist popular groups.
[01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:53.865]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[01:01:54.165 --> 01:01:59.988]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet.
[01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:01.148]  To date.
[01:02:25.862 --> 01:02:26.323]  I'll say this.
[01:02:26.403 --> 01:02:28.926]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media.
[01:02:29.226 --> 01:02:39.018]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[01:02:44.654 --> 01:02:59.345]  We are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy to get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:02:59.405 --> 01:03:08.431]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:10.793]  Perhaps you had better start from the beginning.
[01:03:15.435 --> 01:03:28.191]  Too many kids are what's making the planet worse.
[01:03:28.452 --> 01:03:30.634]  A lot of these kids come from bad gene pools.
[01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:33.258]  They don't have stable parents making good decisions.
[01:03:35.362 --> 01:03:41.365]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[01:03:41.746 --> 01:03:48.549]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:03:48.649 --> 01:03:53.632]  Fluoride in water is supposed to fight tooth decay, but could it also cause cancer?
[01:03:53.652 --> 01:03:56.554]  Turns out the government had the right, under U.S.
[01:03:56.594 --> 01:04:00.756]  law, to conduct secret testing on the American public under specific conditions.
[01:04:00.876 --> 01:04:03.838]  We have to work with dark side, or we're gonna spend time in the shadows.
[01:04:05.146 --> 01:04:09.030]  Any attempt to achieve world order must be the work of the devil.
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:09.930]  Well, join me.
[01:04:10.491 --> 01:04:12.613]  I'm glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan.
[01:04:12.853 --> 01:04:14.674]  There's a need for a new world order.
[01:04:16.216 --> 01:04:22.341]  Someday, in the next few years, a solution will emerge.
[01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:11.423]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[01:05:11.803 --> 01:05:12.684]  And I want to thank you all.
[01:05:12.764 --> 01:05:13.744]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[01:05:13.764 --> 01:05:15.544]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[01:05:15.584 --> 01:05:21.866]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[01:05:22.106 --> 01:05:24.246]  And we've got products that help you.
[01:05:24.266 --> 01:05:27.427]  I mean, even mainstream media admits, they have to, that fish oil is the best thing out there.
[01:05:27.447 --> 01:05:28.687]  But you want pure fish oil.
[01:05:28.747 --> 01:05:30.127]  You want the mercury removed.
[01:05:30.267 --> 01:05:32.608]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[01:05:32.688 --> 01:05:40.591]  The best krill oil, the best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic, salmon, and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids, the honor roll.
[01:05:40.611 --> 01:05:41.231]  Three different types.
[01:05:41.251 --> 01:05:42.191]  You cannot do better.
[01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:43.072]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:43.092 --> 01:05:45.373]  Help the brain, help the body, help the heart, help the InfoWars.
[01:05:45.433 --> 01:05:46.193]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[01:05:46.293 --> 01:05:49.434]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula, about to sell out bodies at 50% off.
[01:05:49.534 --> 01:05:51.435]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[01:05:51.535 --> 01:05:53.335]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:53.435 --> 01:05:59.138]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[01:05:59.438 --> 01:05:59.858]  I need it!
[01:06:09.275 --> 01:06:10.358]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:10.498 --> 01:06:12.504]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:33.979 --> 01:06:39.242]  Humans have now achieved what the ancients would see as godlike balance.
[01:06:41.003 --> 01:06:58.474]  And now technology and knowledge is increasing exponentially at a rate undreamed of.
[01:06:58.714 --> 01:07:01.436]  And you have the establishment and the engineers
[01:07:02.509 --> 01:07:26.429]  And the technocrats, supremely arrogant that it is impossible for any of this to go wrong and that humanity just needs to be made obsolete and that the culling of humanity and the replacing of humanity with this new silicon creature is some great holy work.
[01:07:27.714 --> 01:07:34.677]  Now, we've had Bill Joy, we've had Elon Musk, we've had a lot of these people that have been on the inside come out and tell you this, but you can read this in the writings now.
[01:07:35.137 --> 01:07:42.861]  Stuff I covered 20 years ago, things I covered in films like Endgame 11 years ago, are now mainstream news.
[01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:48.443]  And you know, the average person thinking about AI will show some Philip K. Dick robot.
[01:07:49.864 --> 01:08:06.216]  But what AI really is, is systems tracking humans and that know what human decisions are going to be before we make them to control economies and rig systems and vertically consolidate and integrate and create systems of total control.
[01:08:08.238 --> 01:08:15.303]  And it gives the authoritarians levels of domination unrivaled.
[01:08:16.533 --> 01:08:20.154]  And that's why you see all these top scientists coming out warning about AI.
[01:08:21.475 --> 01:08:31.179]  And you've got China that has unbridled controlling populations and just doing absolutely horrible things to their political dissidents, Buddhists, Christians, you name it, with Apple and Google moving over there.
[01:08:32.459 --> 01:08:39.202]  Of course Apple and Google are then going to do incredibly repressive things because that's what they believe in.
[01:08:40.489 --> 01:08:45.891]  And of course, Apple and Google aren't going to work with the Pentagon, because the Pentagon's bad, because America's bad.
[01:08:46.231 --> 01:08:49.393]  China had to kill 100 million people to build the Utopia.
[01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:53.154]  They're not bad, they are collectivists like Tim Cook.
[01:08:54.475 --> 01:08:57.436]  They're billionaire generals that don't pay taxes, because they're communist.
[01:08:58.817 --> 01:09:00.497]  This is about elitism, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:02.278 --> 01:09:09.261]  Apple's coming out with a new patent, it's on Infowars.com and DrugReport.com, with a plan to put their workers in cages,
[01:09:10.712 --> 01:09:12.633]  On top, giant robots.
[01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:19.198]  So that no one can steal goods when you're inside the factory.
[01:09:20.159 --> 01:09:22.020]  A human goes and gets in the robot.
[01:09:24.482 --> 01:09:25.523]  Can we show that graph?
[01:09:25.723 --> 01:09:26.403]  There it is.
[01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:31.006]  And then, that sits on top of a giant multi-ton robot.
[01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.448]  That's, what, 18 feet tall.
[01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:38.132]  So, whatever you can dream of, it's being done.
[01:09:38.192 --> 01:09:39.152]  You're being replaced.
[01:09:39.232 --> 01:09:40.013]  It's funny to them.
[01:09:42.563 --> 01:09:49.468]  And so, if you look at the news, what's happening?
[01:09:52.190 --> 01:09:53.851]  Google doesn't show up for congressional hearings.
[01:09:54.611 --> 01:09:55.572]  Apple does whatever they want.
[01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:56.593]  They've already left.
[01:09:56.633 --> 01:09:57.373]  They're already in China.
[01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:00.255]  Congress is 10, 20 years behind.
[01:10:00.275 --> 01:10:01.856]  They don't even know what they're doing.
[01:10:02.337 --> 01:10:03.738]  The intelligence agencies do.
[01:10:04.358 --> 01:10:05.859]  And half of those are working for the globalists.
[01:10:05.879 --> 01:10:07.040]  The other half are working for Trump.
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.502]  There's a civil war within even the White House.
[01:10:10.385 --> 01:10:18.072]  As traders struggle to keep the American people from getting control of our country back from this global corporate Chinese combine.
[01:10:18.412 --> 01:10:22.596]  Just like England can't get out and Scotland can't get out of the EU.
[01:10:24.337 --> 01:10:25.698]  They never asked to enter the EU.
[01:10:25.918 --> 01:10:27.380]  They had a vote and said, we're going to leave.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:28.501]  And they said, no, you're not.
[01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:31.363]  We've got an EU army that'll stop you.
[01:10:32.064 --> 01:10:33.505]  And you're going to let your borders be open.
[01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:34.926]  And you're going to bring in unlimited people.
[01:10:34.946 --> 01:10:35.847]  We're going to shut you down.
[01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:40.323]  So here's the takeaway.
[01:10:45.169 --> 01:10:47.932]  When you sit back and you see in one day a month ago...
[01:10:49.596 --> 01:10:56.018]  350 op-ed pieces in major papers saying Trump is going to kill reporters, Trump is going to cause violence.
[01:10:56.718 --> 01:11:06.560]  And you see hundreds and hundreds of other articles just this week saying Alex Jones' show had to be banned because he's going to make people with guns kill people.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.480]  That was the headline.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:13.841]  And it was in the London Independent, it was in the New York Times, it was in Yahoo News.
[01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:15.442]  It was just syndicated.
[01:11:15.742 --> 01:11:16.742]  I saw it three places.
[01:11:18.593 --> 01:11:26.139]  And that I'm mean, and the Young Turks said that I was rude to the CNN reporter who was having me banned, so that's a form of violence.
[01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.801]  And I had a leftist come over and say, I want you off the air.
[01:11:29.061 --> 01:11:30.402]  Your speech is violence.
[01:11:32.044 --> 01:11:35.466]  When the New York Times lies about WMDs and gets millions killed, that's okay.
[01:11:35.707 --> 01:11:38.429]  But when I say we have tyranny, this is out of control.
[01:11:38.689 --> 01:11:39.610]  How dare you ban me?
[01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:41.071]  How dare you act like a Hitler Youth?
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.821]  That's what the Nazis did with censor and burn books.
[01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:51.023]  I'm banned for bullying a public figure in a public space who is actually bullying me.
[01:11:52.844 --> 01:11:53.624]  So here's the takeaway.
[01:11:55.445 --> 01:12:09.050]  They are moving with massive PR campaigns that conservatives and libertarians and Christians and President Trump and I particularly am going to cause mass shootings.
[01:12:09.946 --> 01:12:13.228]  Remember when Antifa said we're going to come to your congressman's house and kill them?
[01:12:13.528 --> 01:12:15.429]  We're going to come to the ICE agents' houses and kill them?
[01:12:15.469 --> 01:12:18.491]  And they doxed their homes and I showed Tucker Carlson covering it?
[01:12:20.151 --> 01:12:21.232]  They never showed that on there.
[01:12:22.893 --> 01:12:25.614]  They just said Jones says get battle rifles ready for the media.
[01:12:25.935 --> 01:12:26.495]  Never said that.
[01:12:27.095 --> 01:12:31.918]  I said get your rifles ready to protect yourself and your home if you've been doxed by Antifa.
[01:12:33.117 --> 01:12:42.245]  When they move forward with this takeover, if we're unable to stop them, probably before the election, they will come, on the same night, to targeted homes, and they're gonna try to kill you!
[01:12:42.846 --> 01:12:44.327]  That's what they said they're gonna do!
[01:12:44.687 --> 01:12:50.412]  And I said, they said they're coming to kill you, they've already killed people, they've already shot Scalise, you should know this is happening.
[01:12:52.614 --> 01:12:54.796]  How did every major channel in the country respond?
[01:12:54.896 --> 01:12:57.078]  None of them showed the clip, none of them showed any of it.
[01:12:57.358 --> 01:13:00.101]  They said, Jones said, attack the media with guns.
[01:13:02.355 --> 01:13:09.962]  And Oliver Darcy and Jack Dorsey and all of them went with it and said, yes, yes, Jones is coming with his guns.
[01:13:10.843 --> 01:13:11.703]  Now what does that tell you?
[01:13:11.723 --> 01:13:13.025]  Can you do 2 plus 2 equals 4?
[01:13:13.645 --> 01:13:20.651]  What did Bill Clinton say in 96 when he was 15 points behind in 1995 and he was going to lose the presidency?
[01:13:22.233 --> 01:13:22.693]  What happened?
[01:13:23.254 --> 01:13:24.295]  He was going to lose to Bob Dole.
[01:13:26.997 --> 01:13:27.818]  Oklahoma City happened.
[01:13:29.529 --> 01:13:31.510]  100% Eric Holder and his FBI.
[01:13:31.550 --> 01:13:32.950]  We know the names of the agents that were there.
[01:13:33.271 --> 01:13:34.231]  They were so arrogant.
[01:13:34.251 --> 01:13:36.532]  They checked into a hotel, bragged about it in front of people.
[01:13:37.312 --> 01:13:39.133]  We know the name of the head of the hostage rescue team.
[01:13:39.153 --> 01:13:40.333]  We know the head of the ATF guy.
[01:13:40.654 --> 01:13:41.494]  We know everybody that was there.
[01:13:41.514 --> 01:13:42.374]  I have witnesses that saw him.
[01:13:43.195 --> 01:13:45.395]  They killed some of the people that were witnesses, but not everybody.
[01:13:45.415 --> 01:13:47.816]  I have police officer witnesses that have come on.
[01:13:48.116 --> 01:13:48.957]  Don Browning, you name it.
[01:13:49.857 --> 01:13:51.938]  One cop they killed, cop of the year.
[01:13:52.038 --> 01:13:52.998]  He told his wife everything about it.
[01:13:53.018 --> 01:13:53.799]  He was the first cop there.
[01:13:54.659 --> 01:13:56.520]  That was Terence Yakey.
[01:13:57.898 --> 01:13:58.678]  So I know the names.
[01:13:58.719 --> 01:13:59.579]  I have the hotel receipts.
[01:13:59.619 --> 01:14:00.399]  WorldNetDaily got them.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.620]  I mean, we know who bombed the building.
[01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:04.682]  And they did that to blame the right wing.
[01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:16.229]  They set up an army soldier who they'd used to go infiltrate militias around the country as the guy they then sheep-dipped and cut out to say had done it, then they threatened to kill his family if he spoke out.
[01:14:16.789 --> 01:14:17.570]  I know the folks involved.
[01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:24.874]  I even know people that work with the FBI and ATF, former special operations people, that get hired for the job of infiltrating today.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:30.362]  So I'm going to leave it at that, but I know everything.
[01:14:31.623 --> 01:14:45.513]  Now, I know when I see a PR rollout, so that everybody, when they have the mass shooting or the bombing, and it's blamed on an Alex Jones fan and a Trump supporter, everyone would have already heard that I've been pre-demonized, so no one will want to stand up for me.
[01:14:47.335 --> 01:14:52.359]  And people will say, well, I guess we've got to take his website down itself and take him off the air.
[01:14:54.144 --> 01:15:08.049]  And then in the aftermath of the blown-up nursery or the shot-up school, and them saying an Alex Jones fan did it, the minute you don't stand up for me, within days, Drudge Report's gonna be taken down, Rush Limbaugh, everyone will be taken off the air.
[01:15:08.769 --> 01:15:10.210]  They'll have riots everywhere.
[01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:11.870]  They're preparing to take the president out.
[01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:16.152]  CNN even has an article that Pence is preparing to remove Trump, 25th Amendment.
[01:15:17.832 --> 01:15:20.613]  They're sticking stickers on the president's back saying he's a piece of garbage.
[01:15:20.833 --> 01:15:22.954]  They're putting things up over the door that say Crazy Town.
[01:15:25.452 --> 01:15:30.677]  They're running PSYOPs right now to overthrow our government.
[01:15:31.778 --> 01:15:34.160]  And the CHICOMs and the globalists are all behind it.
[01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:38.825]  And will we see the American people rally behind the President with 47 days left?
[01:15:39.466 --> 01:15:42.789]  Will, with 57 days left, will we see you wake up to this and understand that
[01:15:44.226 --> 01:15:45.407]  This is how authoritarians work.
[01:15:45.447 --> 01:15:53.992]  They pick one person to demonize first, they set the precedent to destroy them, and then once that's accepted with that one person, all other dominoes fall.
[01:15:54.753 --> 01:15:57.255]  I am domino number one in the false flag.
[01:15:57.535 --> 01:15:59.276]  They're preparing any day now to do it.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.722]  Austria, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia.
[01:16:09.015 --> 01:16:09.736]  We're all moving on.
[01:16:10.217 --> 01:16:12.559]  Your regime has become more and more irrelevant.
[01:16:12.639 --> 01:16:17.804]  In London on Saturday, 20,000 people attended a rally to free political prisoner Tommy Robinson.
[01:16:18.324 --> 01:16:20.646]  And those 20,000 people supported Brexit.
[01:16:21.287 --> 01:16:24.750]  In May, another 10,000 people marched in support of free speech.
[01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:26.572]  They too support Brexit.
[01:16:27.572 --> 01:16:29.533]  17.4 million people voted for Brexit.
[01:16:29.693 --> 01:16:31.014]  They still support Brexit.
[01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:34.855]  The majority of the people want the government to get on with Brexit.
[01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:45.220]  You people entertain UK Ramonas, the modern day devil, George Soros, a foreigner kicked out of his own country, an open borders billionaire who openly fights democracy.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:48.242]  He openly pays MEPs to dance to his tune.
[01:16:48.362 --> 01:16:50.003]  You're all suffering from DDD.
[01:16:50.303 --> 01:16:52.284]  Democracy Deficit Disorder.
[01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:57.047]  And that's why we're marching again in London on the 23rd of June.
[01:16:57.107 --> 01:16:58.728]  We want our country back.
[01:16:58.808 --> 01:16:59.969]  Don't cut me off.
[01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.490]  It's one minute to now.
[01:17:04.895 --> 01:17:08.138]  Can you listen, because I think we both speak English, so we can be very clear.
[01:17:08.598 --> 01:17:11.141]  What I was trying to do was help you communicate.
[01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:13.863]  You are going far too fast for the interpreter.
[01:17:13.883 --> 01:17:17.126]  Yeah, but do you know I'm not speaking to all of them in here.
[01:17:17.166 --> 01:17:19.268]  I'm speaking to the UK.
[01:17:19.348 --> 01:17:20.650]  I'm speaking to Mrs May.
[01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:23.212]  I wasn't sent here to talk to any of you.
[01:17:23.232 --> 01:17:26.695]  I was sent here to defend the British people!
[01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:29.298]  Can I just... Colleagues, please.
[01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:33.630]  Please, just a little bit of quiet, please.
[01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:34.451]  Most of you understand English.
[01:17:34.591 --> 01:17:36.433]  English is the language of the world.
[01:17:36.553 --> 01:17:40.258]  Janice Atkinson is an amazing member of the EU Parliament.
[01:17:40.318 --> 01:17:41.099]  It's ceremonial.
[01:17:42.082 --> 01:17:45.724]  But they vote on a lot of things and if the permanent bureaucracy likes it, they then go along with it.
[01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:56.672]  But more and more, they're shutting down the nationalist, patriot movements within it that are using the Parliament as a bully pulpit to expose the authoritarian nature of the EU that was actually hatched by Adolf Hitler.
[01:17:56.792 --> 01:18:05.818]  JaniceAtkinson.co.uk, people just joined us, the amazing footage of them silencing you and other nationalists just from your speech, saying, you speak to us, not to your country.
[01:18:06.278 --> 01:18:17.846]  Just next level and you tie that in with people trying to pull out all over Europe, you tie that in to the GDPR, you tie that in to Article 13, Article 11, that even leftist media says, ends free speech as we know it.
[01:18:17.946 --> 01:18:19.366]  I mean, they are really panicking.
[01:18:19.386 --> 01:18:20.647]  What's going on over there right now?
[01:18:20.827 --> 01:18:26.431]  You know, Alex, we might have got rid of Soviet communism, but we've really got Euro-communism.
[01:18:26.451 --> 01:18:29.453]  And it's alive and well with centralized state control.
[01:18:29.813 --> 01:18:34.315]  And no free speech is allowed unless it's approved by the dear leaders.
[01:18:34.415 --> 01:18:42.199]  Because actually, we took the brick out of the wall for Brexit and what we've seen is that the edifice is now coming down.
[01:18:42.339 --> 01:18:45.661]  So across Poland, across Hungary, in Italy.
[01:18:46.141 --> 01:18:48.522]  In Austria, the people are revolting.
[01:18:48.562 --> 01:18:51.462]  They're actually voting in the populist leaders.
[01:18:51.562 --> 01:18:54.583]  So yeah, the equivalent of Brexit in Italy.
[01:18:54.603 --> 01:19:04.186]  My good friend Matteo Salvini is now the Interior Minister and he's shutting down mosques and he's sending home imams and he is rejecting 500,000 immigrants.
[01:19:04.226 --> 01:19:09.667]  They're doing this exactly the same with my friends who are in the Freedom Party for Austria.
[01:19:09.927 --> 01:19:12.268]  And of course over in Poland,
[01:19:12.908 --> 01:19:13.569]  I think?
[01:19:32.688 --> 01:19:34.409]  But they're fighting for their real life.
[01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:40.433]  They're fighting for the ideal of this Europe that they've set up with this centralised state control.
[01:19:40.794 --> 01:19:50.220]  And because the people are revolting all over the Europe, as you did in America with Trump, and you've got to get rid of Trudeau in Canada, you know, the edifice is falling down.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.122]  So what they're trying to do is control our speech.
[01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:57.385]  But again, there's no free speech unless it's approved by the dear leaders.
[01:20:06.383 --> 01:20:10.965]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.167 --> 01:20:15.427]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:28.016]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:28.476 --> 01:20:31.097]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.137 --> 01:20:34.198]  Now, I got some into how they're planning a false flag to blame me.
[01:20:35.138 --> 01:20:39.240]  First, they pick a few things that I didn't say or didn't do or out of context to demonize me.
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:42.541]  You know, Saddam beat babies' brains out in incubators.
[01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:44.922]  Alex Jones is mean to the Sandy Hook people.
[01:20:45.542 --> 01:20:49.844]  And then they say it over and over again and say I won't stop being mean to the Sandy Hook people when I'm not.
[01:20:50.244 --> 01:20:53.445]  And they'll never have me say that I said that I believe they died.
[01:20:54.730 --> 01:21:05.253]  And then, they say that I'm going to cause violence, and they say Trump's going to cause violence, and then when there's violence, they say we did it when they're the ones pushing it.
[01:21:06.053 --> 01:21:10.894]  Now, coming up in the last segment of this hour, we have the founder of the walk-away movement joining us here in about a minute.
[01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:14.215]  I'm going to cover this article out of Newsday.
[01:21:15.455 --> 01:21:17.596]  This angry man act is growing tired.
[01:21:17.696 --> 01:21:18.876]  William F.B.
[01:21:18.996 --> 01:21:19.376]  O'Reilly.
[01:21:21.547 --> 01:21:26.550]  And he goes on to say, Jones is having a press conference, saying nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.111]  Now I said in that press conference, I believe people died at Sandy Hook.
[01:21:29.531 --> 01:21:34.554]  And I apologize for what I said being twisted out of context, but the media is the ones that keep saying that I said that.
[01:21:35.935 --> 01:21:41.278]  Then he goes on to say he wants to kill me by stabbing me in the carotid artery with a knife.
[01:21:42.519 --> 01:21:43.059]  He says a pen.
[01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:52.201]  So, I'm dehumanized, I need to come to an end, I need to be totally banned, and he says, who's going to stop me if I kill Alex Jones?
[01:21:54.423 --> 01:21:57.606]  And that's why they're trying to dox our offices?
[01:21:58.807 --> 01:22:00.148]  That's why they're harassing us?
[01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:02.129]  Because this is a group of scum.
[01:22:04.852 --> 01:22:07.754]  Did you see Jones harassing senators in the hallways of Washington?
[01:22:08.515 --> 01:22:10.556]  His neck veins were purple and bulging.
[01:22:11.511 --> 01:22:13.152]  A nanomillimeter from bursting.
[01:22:13.893 --> 01:22:15.774]  A straight pin or BIC pin would do it.
[01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:16.735]  I just kept thinking.
[01:22:17.135 --> 01:22:18.096]  Super quick job.
[01:22:18.396 --> 01:22:19.477]  Hardly anyone would see.
[01:22:20.478 --> 01:22:23.840]  And who would turn me in if they did?
[01:22:27.823 --> 01:22:31.325]  So, in the same article, I'm calling for violence, which I'm not.
[01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:32.466]  I'm hurting children, which I'm not.
[01:22:32.746 --> 01:22:33.387]  And I need to be killed.
[01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:40.604]  Well, all I can say is, folks, we're trying to fix this peacefully.
[01:22:40.644 --> 01:22:45.468]  We're not offensively doing anything, but the violent revolution never kicks off, buddy.
[01:22:45.488 --> 01:22:51.151]  You don't have to worry about me, but I got a sneaking suspicion in your town, Santa Claus has got a list.
[01:22:52.112 --> 01:22:53.113]  He's checking it twice.
[01:22:53.413 --> 01:22:55.594]  Marking down has been naughty and nice.
[01:22:57.236 --> 01:22:59.137]  I don't talk about violence, Mr. O'Reilly.
[01:23:07.352 --> 01:23:08.413]  We're going to our guest in a moment.
[01:23:08.433 --> 01:23:09.594]  He's been having some Skype problems.
[01:23:10.514 --> 01:23:13.696]  So I'm going to cover that in the final segment of this hour.
[01:23:14.617 --> 01:23:17.039]  Because they're hyping up for the revolution.
[01:23:17.139 --> 01:23:18.880]  And they're going to be violent and say we are.
[01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:22.683]  It's like we fixed the economy and they say they fixed it.
[01:23:22.803 --> 01:23:23.924]  And you're like, but does it make sense?
[01:23:24.784 --> 01:23:25.044]  I know.
[01:23:25.825 --> 01:23:30.388]  It's like the 49ers won the Super Bowl and then they go, oh but the Cowboys did.
[01:23:30.508 --> 01:23:32.230]  Or you're like, I just saw the 49ers win.
[01:23:34.158 --> 01:23:35.598]  This is what they do.
[01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:37.359]  They just upside down world.
[01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:40.500]  Briefly, we're going to make it through this.
[01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:41.460]  Everybody needs to pray.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.801]  We need to get close to God.
[01:23:42.861 --> 01:23:44.401]  We need to speak out.
[01:23:44.421 --> 01:23:46.282]  We don't want to be intimidated or bullied by these folks.
[01:23:46.342 --> 01:23:49.863]  We want to try to be peaceful as long.
[01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:54.805]  But like they said at Lexington Concord, the Redcoats were marching up 3-1 to the militia.
[01:23:54.845 --> 01:23:58.726]  And the famous quote by the captain was, in fact pull that quote up for later, he said,
[01:24:00.967 --> 01:24:03.949]  He said, we don't want to fight the starter today.
[01:24:04.049 --> 01:24:05.250]  Don't pull the trigger first.
[01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:07.071]  We're going to be peaceful.
[01:24:07.131 --> 01:24:10.693]  But if they attack us, if they pull the trigger, if they're looking for a fight, they're going to get one.
[01:24:11.534 --> 01:24:12.594]  And it's the same thing.
[01:24:12.634 --> 01:24:13.935]  We're not going to pull the trigger first.
[01:24:15.436 --> 01:24:19.038]  But you've got the deep state and all these globalists just hyped up.
[01:24:19.418 --> 01:24:22.961]  And I'm the, like the toy they use to train dogs to be attack dogs.
[01:24:23.541 --> 01:24:24.562]  I'm the training doll.
[01:24:25.222 --> 01:24:28.524]  And once they get them a taste for blood, they're lining everybody up for this.
[01:24:28.584 --> 01:24:29.925]  And these are really dangerous people.
[01:24:31.394 --> 01:24:35.199]  Can you imagine if I wrote an op-ed about killing a reporter?
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:41.507]  I got taken off Twitter, they say, because I talked to the guy and called him a Nazi that got me banned off all the platforms.
[01:24:41.527 --> 01:24:42.267]  That's what Nazis do.
[01:24:43.362 --> 01:24:46.344]  So please support us, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:24:46.364 --> 01:24:48.906]  We've got to end the tumeric special, ultimate tumeric special today.
[01:24:49.226 --> 01:24:50.587]  Body, it is about to sell out.
[01:24:50.988 --> 01:24:53.970]  The ultimate bone broth, 1995, amazing quality, so good for your body.
[01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:55.551]  That is a super deal.
[01:24:55.591 --> 01:24:56.452]  That's got to end today.
[01:24:56.832 --> 01:24:59.294]  The brain forest specials, a bunch of specials will end today.
[01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.115]  I've been so busy, I haven't come up with a new special.
[01:25:01.135 --> 01:25:03.217]  That's why this has been extended, but it's got to end.
[01:25:03.297 --> 01:25:08.181]  All the big specials, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:25:08.241 --> 01:25:10.162]  And thank you all for your support.
[01:25:10.342 --> 01:25:11.083]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:25:15.495 --> 01:25:18.076]  Now, Brandon Strzok is our guest for this segment and the next.
[01:25:18.897 --> 01:25:22.819]  He's launched the amazing JustWalkAway, WalkAway movement.
[01:25:22.859 --> 01:25:24.260]  Hashtag WalkAway.
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:30.003]  We're 57 days out from the election and I know he's got some big things cooking and happening.
[01:25:30.043 --> 01:25:33.365]  I want to talk about his experiences and how the movement's gaining steam.
[01:25:33.405 --> 01:25:35.586]  I know it's been censored some by Twitter and others.
[01:25:35.626 --> 01:25:41.789]  He's there on Twitter, so people can follow him for now at least, at USMinority.
[01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.131]  So, Brandon, thanks for coming on with us again.
[01:25:44.943 --> 01:25:45.786]  Thanks for having me back.
[01:25:52.394 --> 01:25:53.195]  A lot has happened.
[01:25:53.415 --> 01:25:56.238]  The campaign continues to grow and thrive.
[01:25:56.298 --> 01:26:12.815]  We have, at this point, a publication called the Red Pill Pundit did sort of the analytics for us and discovered that we have at this point about 300, over 370,000 patriots in the walkaway campaign if you take into account all different social media platforms.
[01:26:13.095 --> 01:26:13.956]  It's really incredible.
[01:26:14.356 --> 01:26:14.757]  People are
[01:26:15.257 --> 01:26:16.138]  It's very exciting.
[01:26:16.158 --> 01:26:18.519]  Again, so many people joined the movement.
[01:26:18.619 --> 01:26:20.420]  I know it really scares the Democrats.
[01:26:41.055 --> 01:26:41.315]  Yeah.
[01:26:41.956 --> 01:26:56.015]  Well, you know, what happened, Alex, is that, you know, as the campaign kind of exploded, because we're barely over three months old, we got a good amount of attention from the media, particularly the media sort of on the right and in the center.
[01:26:56.015 --> 01:27:02.119]  Sure, but the left-wing media, of course, blatantly ignored us during those early weeks and months.
[01:27:02.199 --> 01:27:10.805]  And then when we finally got to the point where we were no longer ignorable by them, they did start putting out stories, but they've never reached out to me for a comment.
[01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:12.467]  They've never reached out to me for an interview.
[01:27:12.507 --> 01:27:21.313]  And what they did instead was put out stories invalidating the campaign and the voices of the people, saying that they are Russian bots, Russian propaganda.
[01:27:21.893 --> 01:27:23.274]  Uh, paid actors.
[01:27:23.795 --> 01:27:30.821]  Uh, they said that they are, uh, pictures that have been stolen from Shutterstock with fake testimonials attached to them.
[01:27:30.861 --> 01:27:39.508]  I mean, literally just, and it's so interesting because one of the things of many things I wanted to accomplish with this campaign was giving a voice back to the silent majority.
[01:27:39.588 --> 01:27:44.293]  The, the people in the country who have just been steamrolled over and over again, ignored.
[01:27:44.633 --> 01:27:45.874]  The media doesn't talk to them.
[01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:48.016]  They talk about them, but you know,
[01:27:48.856 --> 01:27:50.236]  They're doing it to them all over again.
[01:27:50.337 --> 01:27:59.899]  I mean, finally, these people stepped up and made their voices heard, and they are being completely disregarded and invalidated by the left-wing media.
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:02.960]  You're right.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.960]  And I also saw them say, oh, you're a Russian agent.
[01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:09.501]  And any time any other country votes for sovereignty, they're a Russian agent.
[01:28:09.521 --> 01:28:13.342]  Or the Brazilian Trump that's so popular that he's tried to kill, he's a Russian agent.
[01:28:13.642 --> 01:28:15.843]  I mean, I didn't know the Russians had such magical powers.
[01:28:16.812 --> 01:28:18.815]  Yeah, and there's other countries in the world too.
[01:28:18.895 --> 01:28:20.957]  I mean, what is the obsession with Russia?
[01:28:21.017 --> 01:28:23.520]  I mean, these people need more creativity.
[01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.142]  It's just boring at this point.
[01:28:25.202 --> 01:28:27.205]  I mean, choose another scary country.
[01:28:27.225 --> 01:28:30.709]  If the Russians had all this power, they wouldn't be having all the problems.
[01:28:30.749 --> 01:28:33.032]  I mean, what type of magical creatures have this power?
[01:28:33.292 --> 01:28:36.336]  I'll tell you, the communist Chinese have a billion, four hundred million people.
[01:28:36.676 --> 01:28:42.100]  And they are the ones that are taking over, and I'm not against the Chinese people, the Communist Chinese themselves, and that's evident by what we see.
[01:28:42.121 --> 01:28:45.103]  The Pentagon, Google won't even work with the Pentagon, but they've moved to China.
[01:28:45.323 --> 01:28:50.788]  We're going to come back and talk about some of the exciting folks that have walked away and your predictions for the big red wave.
[01:28:50.828 --> 01:28:55.291]  I think we're going to see, and that's why the left is panicking right now, and so much more.
[01:28:55.712 --> 01:28:57.353]  Brandon Strzoka is our guest.
[01:28:57.433 --> 01:28:59.275]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:09.373]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.
[01:29:10.113 --> 01:29:18.759]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:28.426]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[01:29:29.366 --> 01:29:40.133]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[01:29:40.813 --> 01:29:49.919]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[01:29:50.379 --> 01:29:52.721]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[01:29:53.121 --> 01:29:56.504]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:29:56.784 --> 01:30:02.088]  Now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:07.152]  Alpha Power Vital Male Androgen Biosynthesis Promoter.
[01:30:07.272 --> 01:30:15.518]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[01:30:15.639 --> 01:30:17.260]  But here's what you want to know.
[01:30:18.234 --> 01:30:24.197]  You want to go to mfullmorestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:28.398]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[01:30:29.279 --> 01:30:37.282]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[01:30:37.862 --> 01:30:45.526]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[01:30:46.326 --> 01:30:50.093]  It's got the best of ancient science with the latest developments as well.
[01:30:50.694 --> 01:30:51.455]  It's Alpha Power.
[01:30:51.515 --> 01:30:54.621]  And quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[01:30:55.701 --> 01:31:10.569]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[01:31:10.989 --> 01:31:16.312]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[01:31:16.632 --> 01:31:18.193]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[01:31:18.493 --> 01:31:19.333]  Oh man, it's really great.
[01:31:19.353 --> 01:31:19.813]  It really works.
[01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:24.434]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alva Power because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[01:31:24.974 --> 01:31:29.275]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[01:31:29.295 --> 01:31:30.655]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[01:31:31.455 --> 01:31:37.676]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a 5 to 7 times markup.
[01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:40.137]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[01:31:40.717 --> 01:31:42.297]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[01:31:42.317 --> 01:31:43.437]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[01:31:43.477 --> 01:31:45.138]  You've got marketing and other costs that go in.
[01:31:48.058 --> 01:31:48.899]  But here's an example.
[01:31:49.719 --> 01:31:57.323]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[01:31:57.343 --> 01:31:59.044]  It just has a little bit in it.
[01:31:59.524 --> 01:32:05.688]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[01:32:06.368 --> 01:32:11.454]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[01:32:11.755 --> 01:32:20.105]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[01:32:20.505 --> 01:32:21.526]  Nobody else does that.
[01:32:21.606 --> 01:32:24.270]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[01:32:24.790 --> 01:32:40.915]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[01:32:41.335 --> 01:32:50.318]  So, you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the Globalists, a 360 win.
[01:32:50.658 --> 01:32:52.678]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[01:32:53.058 --> 01:32:58.580]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLive.com or InfoWarsStore.com by calling toll-free, AAA, 253-3139.
[01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.180]  A total 360 win.
[01:32:59.220 --> 01:33:00.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.198 --> 01:33:30.612]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.732 --> 01:33:35.516]  You can feel the quickening.
[01:33:37.279 --> 01:33:40.361]  The red wave globally is humanity awakens.
[01:33:41.082 --> 01:33:45.925]  The red blood unifying us in a vision of prosperity and kinship.
[01:33:46.905 --> 01:33:49.707]  The cold-blooded globalists on the left are the opposite of liberals.
[01:33:50.968 --> 01:33:55.951]  They are openly trying to divide us on race, on religion, on sexual preference.
[01:33:56.652 --> 01:33:58.573]  The opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about.
[01:33:58.593 --> 01:34:04.797]  We're all individuals judged by who we are and what we do and what we stand for, not what group we're in.
[01:34:06.089 --> 01:34:14.932]  The whole leftist ideology developed in Jacob and France 200 years ago, 220 years ago, is the opposite of classical liberalism.
[01:34:15.132 --> 01:34:15.892]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:34:16.892 --> 01:34:18.673]  And Jefferson finally figured that out himself.
[01:34:18.973 --> 01:34:22.774]  It's an excellent Prager University video, posted at Infowars.com.
[01:34:23.794 --> 01:34:27.375]  Liberalism versus leftist, and what the difference is.
[01:34:27.415 --> 01:34:32.657]  But going back to Brandon Strock, who is on Twitter at U.S.
[01:34:34.016 --> 01:34:34.556]  Minority.
[01:34:35.057 --> 01:34:39.559]  He is the man who developed the walk away program in just the last few months.
[01:34:39.619 --> 01:34:40.220]  It's exploded.
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:41.901]  You've got a big march coming up.
[01:34:41.961 --> 01:34:44.782]  You've got a lot of great points in the nine minutes we have left.
[01:34:44.822 --> 01:34:47.164]  So just tell us about this big march that's coming up.
[01:34:47.224 --> 01:34:49.705]  What folks can do in their own testimonials.
[01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:55.108]  Saying that why they walked away and why are some of the reasons.
[01:34:55.128 --> 01:34:57.410]  Tell us about the march that people tell you they're walking away.
[01:34:58.237 --> 01:34:58.497]  Sure.
[01:34:58.917 --> 01:35:01.338]  Well, a lot of it is what you just said a moment ago.
[01:35:01.438 --> 01:35:04.500]  I mean, people are very fed up with the identity politics.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:10.842]  They're fed up with the oppressive PC culture where people feel like they can't express an opinion or talk anymore.
[01:35:11.022 --> 01:35:12.623]  It's totally oppressive.
[01:35:13.624 --> 01:35:14.404]  And people are
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:23.566]  You know, the election of Donald Trump, I think, really brought to light the true nature of the extremism that's taking place over on the left.
[01:35:23.606 --> 01:35:30.671]  I mean, we've just seen, like, on steroids, the violence, the name-calling, the vandalism, the fake news.
[01:35:30.871 --> 01:35:32.973]  And I don't have to tell you about censorship.
[01:35:35.434 --> 01:35:36.795]  People are really getting it now.
[01:35:36.855 --> 01:35:56.169]  They're really waking up, and for people like myself, who's a gay man, I think for racial minorities in America, we're seeing the ways in which we've been manipulated and used and lied to, how they've been telling us for a long time, you know, we're in danger, we're in danger, we need to be a Democrat, we need to be a liberal, we're only welcome on the left, the people on the right hate us.
[01:35:56.489 --> 01:35:57.930]  Well, I sure haven't found that to be true.
[01:36:00.411 --> 01:36:10.734]  I mean, I can't imagine being more embraced and supported than I have been since I created the WalkAway campaign, and I myself am now a registered Republican and a conservative.
[01:36:11.315 --> 01:36:12.915]  These are the stories that I'm hearing from people.
[01:36:12.955 --> 01:36:16.256]  Now, not everybody walks away and becomes a Republican like I did.
[01:36:16.276 --> 01:36:17.837]  Some people, you know, it's a journey.
[01:36:18.157 --> 01:36:20.397]  Some people consider themselves libertarian, independent.
[01:36:20.658 --> 01:36:25.059]  What we really encourage is for them to just get away from the Democratic Party and get away from liberalism.
[01:36:25.519 --> 01:36:36.207]  Because, as we see, they're becoming more fringe, they're becoming more extreme, they're certainly becoming more entitled, and they're, you know, pushing towards globalism, socialism, communism.
[01:36:36.307 --> 01:36:41.410]  I mean, these are things that are really dangerous, and they're really, once again, targeting these minority groups.
[01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:46.474]  I mean, I'm very concerned about the future of gay community or
[01:36:48.035 --> 01:36:49.036]  It's very cult-like!
[01:37:08.291 --> 01:37:08.611]  Very.
[01:37:09.332 --> 01:37:09.732]  Very.
[01:37:10.172 --> 01:37:13.274]  And so that's what we're trying to show them is like, look, you're not alone here.
[01:37:13.315 --> 01:37:21.380]  You have options, you have choices, and you have support waiting for you on the other side if you want to walk away as so many people are ready to walk away.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:29.265]  Now going back to my point that I was making earlier about the left-wing media and how, you know, finally a lot of these, because it's not just people on the left who are making their testimonials.
[01:37:29.345 --> 01:37:31.387]  I wanted it to be for people on the right too who
[01:37:31.787 --> 01:37:32.488]  We're good to go.
[01:37:52.145 --> 01:37:58.586]  We're giving people the opportunity to take their voice back, but the media has stolen that, once again, from the left-wing media.
[01:37:58.866 --> 01:38:04.847]  And that's what gave me the idea to push back and do this live demonstration, a walk-away march on Washington.
[01:38:05.147 --> 01:38:13.809]  And so what we're really doing here is we are, right before the midterm elections, one week before the midterm elections, we are going to meet in our nation's capital.
[01:38:14.469 --> 01:38:17.329]  We are going to walk away, quite literally, from the Democratic Party.
[01:38:17.369 --> 01:38:19.910]  We're marching from the DNC to our nation's capital.
[01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:25.134]  To a stunning, beautiful backdrop where the inaugurations have taken place before.
[01:38:25.374 --> 01:38:26.935]  We're going to have incredible speakers.
[01:38:27.255 --> 01:38:30.178]  Now this is happening October 26th through the 28th.
[01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:37.003]  And what we're doing is on Friday, October 26th, we're going to have an elegant gala dinner at the Trump International Hotel.
[01:38:37.523 --> 01:38:49.328]  We're going to kick things off Saturday morning, October 27th by marching away from the DNC to our nation's capital, where we're going to have a stunning backdrop and a rally filled with incredible speakers.
[01:38:49.649 --> 01:38:50.669]  I hope you'll be there, Alex.
[01:38:51.289 --> 01:38:52.290]  Oh, I'm definitely going to be there.
[01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:54.591]  I'm going to be in Washington a lot more now because of the censorship.
[01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:56.610]  Well, good, wonderful.
[01:38:56.650 --> 01:38:57.291]  We want you there.
[01:38:57.951 --> 01:39:04.273]  And then we're going to close things out on Sunday, October 28th at the closing brunch and give people the day to travel back home and be with their families.
[01:39:04.673 --> 01:39:11.275]  But I can't stress enough how important this is because this is really going to show
[01:39:12.035 --> 01:39:17.139]  So many people going into these midterm elections that, you know, we're pushing back.
[01:39:17.559 --> 01:39:18.880]  This is not what we want for our country.
[01:39:18.900 --> 01:39:19.820]  We're not going to take it anymore.
[01:39:19.860 --> 01:39:26.365]  We're against the violence, the vandalism, the censorship, the fake news, the calls for impeachment.
[01:39:27.085 --> 01:39:27.706]  We're sick of it.
[01:39:27.846 --> 01:39:29.747]  I mean, we as Americans are coming together.
[01:39:29.807 --> 01:39:33.349]  I don't care if you're just leaving the left, if you're in the center, if you're on the right.
[01:39:33.389 --> 01:39:39.233]  We're all coming together for this walkaway march on Washington to say this is not what we want for our future going forward.
[01:39:39.453 --> 01:39:40.314]  We want something better.
[01:39:40.434 --> 01:39:41.355]  We want something different.
[01:39:42.215 --> 01:39:50.480]  Well, I gotta tell you, you're a great spokesperson, very well spoken, very smart, and it's just wonderful that you had this idea, and now everybody needs to come.
[01:39:50.601 --> 01:39:55.564]  I will be there, I will be there, and I will try to get as much of my audience to go, and we'll be there and cover it.
[01:39:55.864 --> 01:39:58.926]  We want all the media, all the independent media to be there to cover it.
[01:39:59.446 --> 01:40:19.839]  And I think then folks should also maybe show up a day early and go visit the Senate offices and the House offices and go talk to these people and tell them what you want and tell them what you're upset about and go talk to the Republicans particularly and tell them you want them to stop the censorship and the bullying of conservatives, libertarians, just anybody that isn't in this weird PC cult.
[01:40:20.836 --> 01:40:22.277]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:40:22.477 --> 01:40:32.564]  And you made a good point there because this is, you know, one of the things we're going to have a diverse group of speakers and we want to get, you know, the word out about a lot of these issues that, you know, don't make it into the mainstream media.
[01:40:32.604 --> 01:40:34.345]  We want to talk about censorship.
[01:40:34.385 --> 01:40:35.766]  We want to talk about socialism.
[01:40:36.406 --> 01:40:37.867]  You know, we want to talk about Antifa.
[01:40:37.907 --> 01:40:42.410]  We want to talk about all these things that are, you know, and but we're also going to have voter registration available.
[01:40:42.651 --> 01:40:49.935]  We're going to have education available to people to know how they should be voting and how important it is to be voting going into these midterm elections.
[01:40:49.995 --> 01:40:50.596]  I mean, this really
[01:40:51.056 --> 01:40:58.221]  This is a very crucial election that has the potential to really alter and shift the course that our country goes on going forward.
[01:40:58.241 --> 01:40:59.242]  This is very important.
[01:40:59.282 --> 01:41:00.682]  That's why we want to get people there.
[01:41:00.983 --> 01:41:08.788]  And if I may quickly say, Alex, too, unfortunately, it's not inexpensive to do something like this.
[01:41:08.868 --> 01:41:13.711]  And so if people are able to support us, please go to walkawaymarch.com.
[01:41:13.771 --> 01:41:18.234]  You can click on, I believe it says funding, sponsorship, something along those lines.
[01:41:18.234 --> 01:41:19.015]  We're about to go there.
[01:41:19.055 --> 01:41:23.218]  People don't know how much it is to, like, get the Capitol Police, get the area cordoned off.
[01:41:23.238 --> 01:41:24.338]  People say, oh, go have a march.
[01:41:24.519 --> 01:41:24.879]  Hundreds.
[01:41:25.639 --> 01:41:26.860]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:41:27.161 --> 01:41:27.361]  Yes.
[01:41:28.246 --> 01:41:31.468]  Well, I'm just glad you've organized this, and people should go there and they should donate.
[01:41:31.508 --> 01:41:32.648]  walkawaymarch.com.
[01:41:32.688 --> 01:41:36.050]  In fact, that's right where I was going when you said that.
[01:41:36.410 --> 01:41:38.711]  This war takes money, just like we need money.
[01:41:38.751 --> 01:41:38.811]  Yes.
[01:41:38.991 --> 01:41:39.972]  And we want to thank the audience.
[01:41:40.032 --> 01:41:40.912]  Our audience gives so much.
[01:41:40.952 --> 01:41:41.232]  Thank you.
[01:41:41.552 --> 01:41:46.155]  This walkaway march has a real chance of winning the election, and I think there's going to be a red wave.
[01:41:46.255 --> 01:41:50.997]  The problem is, there's going to be so much election fraud by the Democrats, they admit, we've got to work even harder.
[01:41:51.735 --> 01:41:53.416]  That's, well, absolutely right.
[01:41:53.496 --> 01:41:58.439]  And this is what I keep telling people too, you know, people keep saying, oh, there's not going to be a blue wave.
[01:41:58.479 --> 01:41:59.399]  We're going to have a red tsunami.
[01:41:59.419 --> 01:42:00.460]  We're going to have a red tsunami.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:09.645]  I think every citizen from today until election day should be operating under the assumption that we do not have this in the bag.
[01:42:10.066 --> 01:42:15.809]  We need to take every precaution and every step necessary to ensure a victory on election day.
[01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:19.271]  We should not be going into this with the attitude that we've got this.
[01:42:19.411 --> 01:42:22.593]  They got thousands of articles saying me and Trump are going to cause violence against media.
[01:42:22.613 --> 01:42:23.673]  You can see them setting it up.
[01:42:23.934 --> 01:42:25.134]  They're going to rig something.
[01:42:25.494 --> 01:42:27.195]  I'm telling you, they got something big the next 57 days.
[01:42:29.431 --> 01:42:30.212]  I agree with you.
[01:42:30.312 --> 01:42:30.832]  I agree with you.
[01:42:30.852 --> 01:42:32.172]  That's why we've got to come together.
[01:42:32.513 --> 01:42:33.473]  We've got to push back.
[01:42:34.093 --> 01:42:49.320]  And it's I think more important now than ever that people understand, look, even if you don't necessarily consider yourself a Republican or even if you maybe have issues with the Republican Party right now, this isn't an election where you get to go in and kind of say, I'm not sure I feel.
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:53.361]  I mean, what we're really it's it's not so much electing a Republican.
[01:42:53.502 --> 01:42:56.843]  It's about making sure that Democrats do not end up in office.
[01:42:56.943 --> 01:42:57.185]  That's right.
[01:42:57.205 --> 01:42:58.050]  They're authoritarians.
[01:42:58.271 --> 01:42:58.975]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:59.015 --> 01:42:59.900]  Come back on again soon.
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.443]  We'll be right back.

[01:43:22.023 --> 01:43:22.363]  Bam!
[01:43:22.583 --> 01:43:24.804]  Problem solved just like that.

[01:43:35.349 --> 01:43:35.809]  Pretty cool.
[01:43:36.089 --> 01:43:36.690]  But guess what?
[01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:37.670]  It gets better.

[01:43:46.557 --> 01:43:46.877]  Woo!
[01:43:47.137 --> 01:43:48.158]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:43:48.178 --> 01:43:49.779]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:51.881]  Support the InfoWars.
[01:43:52.421 --> 01:43:57.265]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:02.426 --> 01:44:02.867]  Look at that.
[01:44:02.887 --> 01:44:07.896]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear, and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[01:44:08.256 --> 01:44:08.978]  We didn't do that.
[01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:13.590]  I would metaphysically tell you something.
[01:44:13.610 --> 01:44:14.771]  This is the very best I can get.
[01:44:15.191 --> 01:44:16.851]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:44:17.431 --> 01:44:25.973]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:44:26.433 --> 01:44:28.133]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:44:28.173 --> 01:44:29.293]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:44:29.954 --> 01:44:32.474]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:44:32.534 --> 01:44:33.634]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:44:34.394 --> 01:44:37.195]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:44:40.151 --> 01:44:41.513]  Liquid consciousness.
[01:44:44.897 --> 01:44:45.257]  Look it up.
[01:44:46.358 --> 01:44:46.839]  Find out.
[01:44:47.079 --> 01:44:52.365]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[01:44:52.405 --> 01:44:57.271]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[01:44:57.731 --> 01:44:59.934]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[01:44:59.994 --> 01:45:00.835]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:45:10.939 --> 01:45:17.123]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:45:17.543 --> 01:45:25.949]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:45:26.289 --> 01:45:30.532]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:45:30.852 --> 01:45:31.812]  You are the info warrior.
[01:45:32.293 --> 01:45:35.815]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[01:45:36.578 --> 01:45:48.104]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:45:48.164 --> 01:45:58.050]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.770]  I think?
[01:46:18.234 --> 01:46:21.455]  We are following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:46:21.815 --> 01:46:23.876]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:46:24.356 --> 01:46:29.317]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is, or what sex we are, or where we came from.
[01:46:29.877 --> 01:46:37.539]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:44.741]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:45.081 --> 01:46:46.442]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:47.022 --> 01:46:48.382]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:48.722 --> 01:46:50.263]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:50.883 --> 01:46:52.563]  And many others are across the world.
[01:46:52.804 --> 01:46:53.564]  We are the future.
[01:46:54.484 --> 01:46:55.424]  We are the renaissance.
[01:46:55.984 --> 01:46:57.265]  And we are winning.
[01:47:06.327 --> 01:47:09.008]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.164 --> 01:47:35.888]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:54.959 --> 01:48:01.142]  We have a very very clear picture of what's going on when you study all the different globalist activities around the world.
[01:48:02.782 --> 01:48:08.364]  You see the formula they're using and then you end up even reading white papers and documents where they admit the plan.
[01:48:09.645 --> 01:48:10.905]  And it is to break your will.
[01:48:12.286 --> 01:48:16.507]  There are stabbings and acid attacks and car attacks every day in Europe now.
[01:48:16.527 --> 01:48:20.129]  I've got a stack of them from just this weekend and today.
[01:48:22.506 --> 01:48:30.673]  And then the police won't even respond to those, but they'll respond to someone saying mean things.
[01:48:34.957 --> 01:48:35.558]  Think about that.
[01:48:36.899 --> 01:48:37.419]  It's crazy.
[01:48:39.621 --> 01:48:44.185]  But that's about rubbing it in your face and training you to accept anything.
[01:48:46.488 --> 01:48:46.788]  It's like
[01:48:48.956 --> 01:48:52.759]  In the same program on CNN, they'll say Trump's trying to censor the media.
[01:48:52.779 --> 01:48:54.160]  He's a total tyrant when he's not.
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:55.600]  He's just speaking back against them.
[01:48:57.101 --> 01:48:58.362]  He wants violence against us.
[01:48:58.502 --> 01:49:01.665]  And then they'll go, next up, Antifa attacks Nazis.
[01:49:02.105 --> 01:49:03.266]  That means anybody they disagree with.
[01:49:03.646 --> 01:49:04.526]  And they're good guys.
[01:49:06.688 --> 01:49:09.210]  And then next up, we need to ban Alex Jones off the internet.
[01:49:12.992 --> 01:49:15.274]  And then they have hundreds and hundreds of news programs
[01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:21.547]  On MSNBC, CNN, ABC News, lie about me and go, when will he be taking off the internet?
[01:49:21.827 --> 01:49:24.030]  And then now, when will he be taking off the radio?
[01:49:24.271 --> 01:49:26.634]  And when will he be taking off his own website?
[01:49:26.654 --> 01:49:30.719]  Because let me tell you, when they start taking the app, you pay for it.
[01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:47.216]  Thousands of dollars have it reviewed, it's accepted, it goes to number one in news, has five stars, 18,000 plus ratings, over two million downloads, and last Friday at 7.05, they pull it out of the app store, send us a message, and put in its place the Huffington Post.
[01:49:48.676 --> 01:49:50.117]  Like, we're not just gonna stab ya.
[01:49:51.957 --> 01:49:53.298]  We're gonna rub salt in the wound.
[01:49:53.318 --> 01:49:55.379]  We're not gonna just crap on ya, we're gonna rub it in.
[01:49:55.419 --> 01:49:56.079]  How's that feel?
[01:49:57.039 --> 01:49:59.100]  How like when they banned our YouTube channel that had
[01:50:00.834 --> 01:50:03.595]  Two and a half million subscribers and a couple billion views.
[01:50:04.016 --> 01:50:04.696]  Just one channel.
[01:50:06.157 --> 01:50:08.798]  They had links to the dead channel.
[01:50:08.978 --> 01:50:09.818]  Never seen that happen before.
[01:50:09.878 --> 01:50:10.759]  Usually just a dead channel.
[01:50:11.199 --> 01:50:12.640]  It said, no, here's your new channels.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.041]  And it was Stephen Colbert and the Democratic Party.
[01:50:17.442 --> 01:50:19.043]  It was like five links to the Democrats.
[01:50:21.524 --> 01:50:23.225]  That's like leaving an Ace of Spades card.
[01:50:23.285 --> 01:50:25.966]  You know, like the Phoenix teams would do in Vietnam.
[01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:27.347]  They're going to kill a whole village.
[01:50:28.447 --> 01:50:29.788]  Just send a message to the next village.
[01:50:31.226 --> 01:50:34.548]  And they'd stick an ace of spades in whoever the leader of the village's mouth was.
[01:50:36.029 --> 01:50:38.330]  It's like, we took you down.
[01:50:39.230 --> 01:50:39.911]  We gangstas.
[01:50:41.452 --> 01:50:43.253]  Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta.
[01:50:45.674 --> 01:50:46.935]  Of course, they were always gangstas.
[01:50:46.955 --> 01:50:50.216]  They're not liberals that are out of control, that have gotten derangement syndrome.
[01:50:50.236 --> 01:50:50.957]  That's the low level.
[01:50:52.198 --> 01:50:53.198]  They're fully conscious.
[01:50:54.059 --> 01:51:00.082]  And there are so many threats coming in that just since I got this last threat 15 minutes ago from Newsday,
[01:51:04.818 --> 01:51:11.161]  Another threat came in.
[01:51:13.463 --> 01:51:20.586]  So you got Newsday saying somebody needs to go to an Alex Jones event and jam a knife into his carotid arteries.
[01:51:22.607 --> 01:51:24.468]  He says, or a big number two pencil.
[01:51:27.930 --> 01:51:28.530]  And he said it.
[01:51:30.291 --> 01:51:31.012]  F.B.
[01:51:31.152 --> 01:51:32.973]  O'Reilly on Twitter.
[01:51:34.468 --> 01:51:36.449]  People say, hey, should we go file complaints on him?
[01:51:36.789 --> 01:51:38.170]  Don't even hold your breath.
[01:51:40.332 --> 01:51:50.838]  When you say you need to go to an Alex Jones event and ram a blonde object and murder him, he'll probably be made a manager at Twitter.
[01:51:55.021 --> 01:51:55.841]  And then we got this.
[01:51:57.282 --> 01:51:57.983]  InfoWars.com.
[01:51:59.721 --> 01:52:02.223]  Broadway star jokes about Trump assassination.
[01:52:02.724 --> 01:52:04.926]  Where's John Wilkes Booth when you need him, she asked.
[01:52:05.566 --> 01:52:11.191]  A well-known Broadway actress joked about President Trump's assassination by referencing the murder of President Abraham Lincoln.
[01:52:12.653 --> 01:52:16.396]  My answer to that is, where's John Wilkes Booth when you need him?
[01:52:17.677 --> 01:52:26.025]  Carol Cook said in a response to a TMZ reporter asking if it's okay to be pro-Trump in a Hollywood musical.
[01:52:27.682 --> 01:52:33.344]  Now you're going to ask me, said the Skeksy, who the hell John Wilkes Booth is.
[01:52:33.444 --> 01:52:40.026]  Her husband, who was by her side, pointed out that Wilkes killed presidents.
[01:52:41.307 --> 01:52:42.907]  No moron, he killed one president.
[01:52:44.248 --> 01:52:53.531]  And then, a doctor, the only other person convicted that helped him, named Dr. Mudd, and I looked it up.
[01:52:54.331 --> 01:52:56.492]  Guess who is from the same family in Virginia?
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:58.420]  Yes.
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:06.521]  Phil Mudd, who says he wants to kill Trump on CNN, and that the deep state's going to kill Trump.
[01:53:07.562 --> 01:53:08.502]  But that's okay.
[01:53:08.662 --> 01:53:15.903]  I went over to Oliver Darcy, who brags he got me banned all over by lying about me, and I said, you act like a Nazi burning books.
[01:53:16.303 --> 01:53:21.164]  Oh my God, you don't call an SJW public figure in a public capacity.
[01:53:21.184 --> 01:53:25.845]  You know, I can see their bullying rules that they enforce when he was at dinner.
[01:53:26.994 --> 01:53:29.835]  And I walked over like the left does and poured coffee on his head or something?
[01:53:30.315 --> 01:53:30.975]  But I wouldn't do that?
[01:53:31.716 --> 01:53:32.636]  Oh, that's me that happened to.
[01:53:32.716 --> 01:53:33.096]  Oh, sorry.
[01:53:33.997 --> 01:53:45.421]  But see, Diggins talk about ramming pencils in my neck and call me a Nazi and get me deplatformed, but when I walk over... And I'm sorry, he looks like... a child molester.
[01:53:45.821 --> 01:53:47.662]  I'm not saying Oliver Darge is a child molester.
[01:53:47.682 --> 01:53:53.884]  He just, if I was... If I was typecasting people for a Hollywood movie about child kidnappers, him and Brian Stelter would be stars.
[01:53:56.912 --> 01:54:07.898]  I mean, they, but we know this, he molests the truth, he hates freedom, and if we can't beat this guy politically, we get what we deserve.
[01:54:09.959 --> 01:54:11.060]  He also looks like a possum.
[01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:16.063]  Have you ever seen a possum when it's eating something really nasty and it looks up at you like that weird smile it has on its face?
[01:54:16.723 --> 01:54:20.125]  I mean, he looks, you know, and I got plenty of things to say.
[01:54:20.645 --> 01:54:22.767]  I could sit there and talk about how evil he is and his background.
[01:54:25.083 --> 01:54:27.545]  By the way, you didn't think I didn't know I'd get banned when I did that?
[01:54:27.565 --> 01:54:28.645]  People go, oh, you wanted to be banned.
[01:54:29.045 --> 01:54:30.766]  No, I wanted to live in a free country.
[01:54:33.208 --> 01:54:34.149]  I'm not gonna shut up.
[01:54:34.889 --> 01:54:35.830]  But you read this guy.
[01:54:37.791 --> 01:54:39.492]  The Angry Man Act is growing tired.
[01:54:42.974 --> 01:54:44.975]  He goes on to say, Jones should be gone soon.
[01:54:45.535 --> 01:54:48.097]  The Enforced Creator is looking dangerously apocalyptic.
[01:54:48.657 --> 01:54:49.158]  Even for him.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:53.964]  Yeah, going in and standing up to those creatures and doing all this is easy.
[01:54:54.024 --> 01:54:55.065]  I mean, I'm focused.
[01:54:55.205 --> 01:54:56.546]  I've never felt more alive, more committed.
[01:54:56.566 --> 01:55:02.572]  In fact, I'm pretty calm compared to the way I usually am because it's just, we're in the thick of the battle now.
[01:55:03.713 --> 01:55:06.096]  Did you see Jones harassing senators?
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:10.962]  Oh, the Democrats just shame themselves and throw things on people and yell and scream and take over committee hearings.
[01:55:11.282 --> 01:55:11.862]  I didn't do that.
[01:55:12.143 --> 01:55:14.024]  I just walked over and said, hey, Americans are being censored.
[01:55:14.044 --> 01:55:14.904]  Do something, Rubio.
[01:55:15.404 --> 01:55:16.565]  I said it very nice at first.
[01:55:16.845 --> 01:55:17.685]  Hey, what about you?
[01:55:17.705 --> 01:55:18.646]  He goes, I don't know who you are.
[01:55:19.286 --> 01:55:20.147]  So that's harassing.
[01:55:20.187 --> 01:55:20.867]  See, I'm not allowed.
[01:55:21.087 --> 01:55:21.707]  I'm just a slave.
[01:55:22.528 --> 01:55:25.189]  Did you see Jones harassing senators in the hallways of Washington?
[01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:30.672]  His neck veins were purple and bulging a nanomillimeter from bursting.
[01:55:31.693 --> 01:55:33.695]  A straight pin or a bick would do it.
[01:55:34.455 --> 01:55:36.817]  I kept thinking, super quick jab.
[01:55:38.318 --> 01:55:39.659]  Hardly anyone would see.
[01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.602]  And who would turn me in if they did?
[01:55:43.622 --> 01:55:46.104]  Because then he lies about Sandy Hook and dehumanizes me.
[01:55:46.124 --> 01:55:48.206]  So see, once he dehumanizes me, now I can be killed.
[01:55:48.746 --> 01:55:53.970]  But then he flips it so he doesn't get arrested and said, no, Jones will be dead soon anyways of a heart attack or whatever.
[01:55:55.011 --> 01:55:56.492]  Maybe Twitter was wrong to take him off.
[01:55:58.382 --> 01:56:00.403]  I tell you what, William F.B.
[01:56:00.483 --> 01:56:04.845]  O'Reilly, you couldn't raise any money like these famous guys that say they want to fight me and then back out.
[01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:15.991]  So, it's not worth it to have a match with you, but I'll do bare knuckles with you in the ring.
[01:56:17.672 --> 01:56:18.372]  No time limit.
[01:56:18.912 --> 01:56:19.813]  You're a big man, buddy.
[01:56:19.853 --> 01:56:22.414]  I tell you what, you can even have a pencil at the start.
[01:56:22.514 --> 01:56:23.135]  I don't need anything.
[01:56:24.115 --> 01:56:25.496]  Just let's get in the ring with me, brother.
[01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:28.179]  You want to go to Indonesia where it's legal?
[01:56:28.439 --> 01:56:29.460]  I'll get in that ring with you.
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:31.920]  You're a big man, huh?
[01:56:32.500 --> 01:56:34.281]  No, you want somebody else to kill me.
[01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:38.622]  What, you don't think I don't know people want to kill me, son?
[01:56:41.002 --> 01:56:44.203]  If I get killed, it's not a victory for you, dumbass.
[01:56:45.063 --> 01:56:46.144]  I went into this willingly.
[01:56:46.964 --> 01:56:47.544]  So understand that.
[01:56:48.968 --> 01:56:50.249]  We're going to go to break, come back.
[01:56:50.769 --> 01:56:51.810]  Joe Selente's coming up.
[01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:53.951]  I want to take some calls in the hour before that.
[01:56:53.991 --> 01:56:59.635]  I want to get into the false flag that's imminent, what's coming, and how we stop it, and the total rebellion inside the White House against the President.
[01:56:59.655 --> 01:57:01.076]  Remember we told you that a year and a half ago?
[01:57:01.096 --> 01:57:02.897]  They're sabotaging him within the White House.
[01:57:03.358 --> 01:57:04.558]  He's totally surrounded by enemies.
[01:57:04.738 --> 01:57:06.840]  They're putting stickers on his back, making fun of him.
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:08.501]  These are cowards.
[01:57:08.541 --> 01:57:11.123]  This is what this nation has bred now, is a bunch of weasels.
[01:57:12.484 --> 01:57:14.145]  And he's in the swamp, up to his knees.
[01:57:15.025 --> 01:57:15.546]  Don't forget,
[01:57:16.465 --> 01:57:22.206]  The best colloidal silver products, the best nano silver salt products, the highest quality FDA approved for over-the-counter.
[01:57:22.226 --> 01:57:23.786]  It's all at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:57:23.866 --> 01:57:29.188]  Big specials on the highest quality turmeric, 95% of humanoid bodies is about to sell out.
[01:57:29.228 --> 01:57:30.088]  So this is the last day.
[01:57:30.108 --> 01:57:32.188]  This is the last day of this weekend, but I don't have a new special yet.
[01:57:32.428 --> 01:57:33.628]  What I'm doing is tomorrow bone broth.
[01:57:33.648 --> 01:57:35.689]  That special is going to end 50% off as well.
[01:57:35.789 --> 01:57:38.349]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:38.389 --> 01:57:41.090]  Great products that you and your family can use and are great for your life.

[01:57:56.378 --> 01:58:03.041]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:58:04.101 --> 01:58:04.562]  It's you.
[01:58:09.130 --> 01:58:09.830]  We're good to go.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:38.411]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:58:38.491 --> 01:58:48.380]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:55.267]  And they're trying to use InfoWars as an example of demonization to keep people from sharing this critical information.
[01:58:55.567 --> 01:58:59.852]  It's a model they admit they plan to use on everybody else once they're done with us.
[01:59:00.453 --> 01:59:08.862]  So when you promote the black sheep trailblazing information from NewsWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, from InfoWars.com, you are firing
[01:59:08.882 --> 01:59:14.124]  Following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country, we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:14.604 --> 01:59:19.547]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are or where we came from.
[01:59:20.127 --> 01:59:27.770]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:59:28.270 --> 01:59:34.973]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:59:34.993 --> 01:59:36.694]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:37.094 --> 01:59:38.655]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:38.975 --> 01:59:40.496]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:59:41.137 --> 01:59:42.798]  And many others are across the world.
[01:59:43.038 --> 01:59:43.818]  We are the future.
[01:59:44.739 --> 01:59:45.679]  We are the renaissance.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.520]  And we are winning.
[01:59:54.665 --> 02:00:00.568]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.363 --> 02:00:15.967]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.787 --> 02:00:23.671]  Infowars.com.
[02:00:23.971 --> 02:00:30.215]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:36.522 --> 02:00:41.504]  We're less than 57 days out from the most important election in modern history.
[02:00:42.464 --> 02:00:47.005]  And I've covered the false flags they've got planned to blame me and the president against the media.
[02:00:48.466 --> 02:00:51.427]  I've covered Obama doubling down and taking complete credit for the economy.
[02:00:52.307 --> 02:00:53.647]  And then telling a string of lies.
[02:00:55.668 --> 02:00:56.488]  Just unbelievable.
[02:00:57.589 --> 02:01:00.330]  All of it completely verifiable in seconds to be complete horse crap.
[02:01:03.991 --> 02:01:04.771]  It's just amazing.
[02:01:06.383 --> 02:01:07.304]  It is truly amazing.
[02:01:11.226 --> 02:01:13.307]  And more and more Democrats are calling for me to be killed.
[02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:19.871]  Meanwhile, the hurricane is speeding up.
[02:01:19.911 --> 02:01:22.252]  They thought it'd be a Cat 4, now it's a Cat 6.
[02:01:22.692 --> 02:01:32.098]  If it actually hits where it's currently trending towards North Carolina and South Carolina, it is going to be devastation.
[02:01:34.662 --> 02:01:38.164]  And so obviously Trump better be ready to swoop in there with maximum aid.
[02:01:38.184 --> 02:01:45.948]  Because even though he's done the best job of any president in modern history of being on top of stuff, I mean, Obama wouldn't even visit after hurricanes hit.
[02:01:47.428 --> 02:01:50.070]  And then Bush is like, doing a great job, Brownie!
[02:01:50.130 --> 02:01:51.230]  No, you didn't do a great job.
[02:01:53.771 --> 02:01:54.932]  A lot of it's where the hurricane hit.
[02:01:54.952 --> 02:01:56.973]  The New Orleans police are just so damn corrupt.
[02:01:58.614 --> 02:02:00.635]  But a lot of other, that doesn't happen in other areas of the South.
[02:02:03.007 --> 02:02:04.668]  Louisiana's a great state, but give me a break.
[02:02:04.708 --> 02:02:06.149]  New Orleans is corrupt as it gets.
[02:02:06.209 --> 02:02:08.210]  I mean, it gives Chicago a run for its money.
[02:02:09.430 --> 02:02:15.774]  Police, like, dragging safe shot of businesses down the street behind their vehicles, robbing Walmarts.
[02:02:17.274 --> 02:02:18.035]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:02:18.075 --> 02:02:23.818]  So, uh, the South getting hit's a little bit more like Japan getting hit.
[02:02:23.838 --> 02:02:25.218]  There's less crime in the South.
[02:02:25.478 --> 02:02:26.159]  Bad things happen.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:29.240]  But we'll see, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:30.141]  Pray for everybody.
[02:02:32.199 --> 02:02:37.023]  This is certainly a crazy time to be alive right now.
[02:02:38.384 --> 02:02:41.006]  So we'll look into all of that coming up the next segment.
[02:02:41.026 --> 02:02:47.591]  I also plan to give the phone number out and take some of your phone calls on the specific issues I've raised and some first-time callers.
[02:02:49.332 --> 02:02:53.315]  Also, Stephen Colbert really attacked me and had a celebration that I was taken off Twitter.
[02:02:55.817 --> 02:02:59.000]  You also got Obama falsely claiming that Trump won't decry Nazis.
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:01.522]  He said you had bad groups on both sides.
[02:03:02.423 --> 02:03:11.547]  Yeah, some of the new right people are Nazis, most of them are feds, it's come out, and they have a right to march, but they're not the ones calling for violence, and they're bad folks.
[02:03:12.968 --> 02:03:18.250]  Antifa came looking for violence, and the police in Charlottesville collided everybody together.
[02:03:19.371 --> 02:03:24.233]  So I want to play that clip where Obama says that Trump
[02:03:26.510 --> 02:03:28.972]  It did not start with Donald Trump.
[02:03:57.443 --> 02:03:59.384]  He is a symptom, not the cause.
[02:04:01.326 --> 02:04:03.047]  Oh, this disease has got our economy exploding.
[02:04:06.489 --> 02:04:11.433]  He's just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years.
[02:04:11.573 --> 02:04:12.493]  What, that illegal aliens are running around?
[02:04:12.513 --> 02:04:14.095]  We're supposed to stand up to discrimination.
[02:04:15.476 --> 02:04:21.760]  And we're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers.
[02:04:32.110 --> 02:04:33.631]  How hard can that be?
[02:04:33.651 --> 02:04:35.451]  How hard can that be?
[02:04:36.371 --> 02:04:46.095]  Obama has such a big moral high ground, and then he sits there, a race pimp, a limousine liberal, lying to everyone, to their face, about what Trump said.
[02:04:47.535 --> 02:04:50.156]  It's incredible, the way they operate.
[02:04:51.316 --> 02:04:55.558]  Trump, by the way, waited a few hours after that riot to talk to Homeland Security and say, who are these groups?
[02:04:55.858 --> 02:04:59.279]  He got files on all of them, and was remarkably accurate in what he said.
[02:05:05.643 --> 02:05:11.645]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[02:05:12.045 --> 02:05:12.925]  And I want to thank you all.
[02:05:13.005 --> 02:05:13.986]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:15.786]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[02:05:15.826 --> 02:05:22.108]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[02:05:22.349 --> 02:05:24.489]  And we've got products that help you.
[02:05:24.509 --> 02:05:27.670]  I mean, even mainstream media admits, they have to, that fish oil is the best thing out there.
[02:05:27.690 --> 02:05:28.911]  But you want the pure fish oil.
[02:05:28.991 --> 02:05:30.371]  You want the mercury removed.
[02:05:30.511 --> 02:05:32.812]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're going to get anywhere.
[02:05:32.932 --> 02:05:40.813]  The best krill oil, the best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic, salmon, and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids, the honor roll.
[02:05:40.853 --> 02:05:41.474]  Three different types.
[02:05:41.494 --> 02:05:42.434]  You cannot do better.
[02:05:42.474 --> 02:05:43.314]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:43.334 --> 02:05:45.614]  Help the brain, help the body, help the heart, help the InfoWars.
[02:05:45.654 --> 02:05:46.434]  Win, win, win, win, win, win.
[02:05:46.534 --> 02:05:49.675]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula, about to sell out bodies at 50% off.
[02:05:49.775 --> 02:05:51.675]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[02:05:51.775 --> 02:05:53.576]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:05:53.676 --> 02:05:59.337]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[02:05:59.677 --> 02:06:00.097]  I need it!
[02:06:21.058 --> 02:06:25.479]  It's now only 56 days.
[02:06:25.659 --> 02:06:28.580]  22 hours, 53 minutes, 46 seconds.
[02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:36.421]  Until the official midterm elections of 2018 kick off and go into the stratosphere.
[02:06:37.202 --> 02:06:40.582]  And the future becomes the present becomes the past.
[02:06:41.903 --> 02:06:43.003]  It's all happening now.
[02:06:45.208 --> 02:06:46.209]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:48.071]  We're now into hour number three.
[02:06:48.111 --> 02:06:51.054]  Gerald Salente is coming up in the fourth hour of the Great Trends Forecaster.
[02:06:51.534 --> 02:06:57.960]  I want to open the phones up this hour specifically on the four big issues I've raised for first-time callers.
[02:06:59.181 --> 02:07:01.864]  The four issues I've raised for first-time callers.
[02:07:03.686 --> 02:07:09.211]  And that is, you understand we're at war with Communist China.
[02:07:12.219 --> 02:07:32.631]  You understand that they announced two years ago that they were officially involved in fifth and sixth generational warfare, economic warfare, cultural warfare, taking over infrastructure, buying off the universities, letting corporate heads of tech companies pay zero taxes, live like above-the-law kings in China.
[02:07:33.011 --> 02:07:34.312]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:07:36.173 --> 02:07:37.194]  That's now all official.
[02:07:38.359 --> 02:07:46.464]  And even the New York Times came out and said they built a great firewall in China, and now they're using it against Alex Jones.
[02:07:50.067 --> 02:07:53.669]  And once the precedent's set for me, it's being launched against you.
[02:07:55.030 --> 02:07:58.012]  And now, as I predicted five weeks ago, it's now happened.
[02:07:59.272 --> 02:08:01.854]  They are purging everybody from Twitter, Facebook, Google.
[02:08:02.114 --> 02:08:03.255]  The heroes of Benghazi.
[02:08:03.555 --> 02:08:04.916]  Republicans running for Congress.
[02:08:04.956 --> 02:08:06.137]  Republicans that are in Congress.
[02:08:07.799 --> 02:08:13.000]  And they sit there to the Republicans and tell them, we're not censoring or shadow banning you, to their faces.
[02:08:14.101 --> 02:08:24.283]  And then Google, who won't even work with our own Pentagon, but will work with the Chinese military, you heard that right, has moved to China and won't even show up to the hearings.
[02:08:24.864 --> 02:08:28.485]  Because they have bought off those politicians for nothing.
[02:08:30.225 --> 02:08:33.806]  Google might give a senator $100,000 for the re-election, might give $5,000, $10,000 per member of Congress.
[02:08:37.526 --> 02:08:40.807]  Chicken feed for that trillion dollar company.
[02:08:41.107 --> 02:08:41.927]  Same thing with Apple.
[02:08:42.607 --> 02:08:43.527]  Over a trillion dollar company.
[02:08:44.607 --> 02:08:47.208]  The Chinese are communist, they're organized, they're focused.
[02:08:48.748 --> 02:08:51.749]  They're brought in as owners of the company.
[02:08:52.109 --> 02:08:52.649]  It's done.
[02:08:52.949 --> 02:08:53.889]  The deal's been made.
[02:08:56.730 --> 02:08:57.830]  And I'm talking about it.
[02:08:59.370 --> 02:09:01.751]  And I'm publicly saying I'm getting information from the President.
[02:09:04.209 --> 02:09:06.410]  And I told you he'd move and start acting, and he is.
[02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:07.170]  Get ready this week.
[02:09:07.490 --> 02:09:10.872]  The word is it's by the end of the week, because they've got people sabotaging him, trying to hold him up.
[02:09:11.132 --> 02:09:19.935]  And that's why they're getting so desperate, because foreign powers bought off our politicians, and they bought off our leaders, and they think they own us.
[02:09:19.975 --> 02:09:21.116]  They said, hey, we got a deal.
[02:09:22.136 --> 02:09:27.778]  We own your debt, we own Hollywood, we let you have these big slave factories, you guys have made trillions of dollars with us.
[02:09:29.379 --> 02:09:29.979]  Now bend over.
[02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:33.492]  Do you understand?
[02:09:33.572 --> 02:09:35.433]  It's all state-run telecoms.
[02:09:35.533 --> 02:09:36.674]  The Chinese government runs it.
[02:09:36.694 --> 02:09:40.817]  If you're a radio listener, we're putting up The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Verge.
[02:09:41.658 --> 02:09:44.540]  I broke all this years ago.
[02:09:46.922 --> 02:09:47.863]  And so now I'm paying.
[02:09:48.703 --> 02:09:54.348]  And see, all these leftists and all these sellouts and all these globalists, they look at me and they go, Ha ha!
[02:09:54.388 --> 02:09:55.969]  Alex is getting banned on Twitter and Facebook!
[02:09:56.169 --> 02:09:56.449]  Ha ha!
[02:09:56.489 --> 02:09:57.270]  He's getting sued!
[02:09:57.550 --> 02:09:57.810]  Ha ha!
[02:09:57.850 --> 02:09:58.671]  People are gonna kill you!
[02:09:58.691 --> 02:09:59.552]  Ha ha!
[02:10:01.977 --> 02:10:04.220]  Major news publications are calling for you to be murdered!
[02:10:09.946 --> 02:10:13.771]  If you just joined us last hour, Newsday is calling for me to be murdered.
[02:10:14.392 --> 02:10:20.299]  They say, somebody find him in public, jam a pencil into his carotid arteries, kill him now!
[02:10:21.420 --> 02:10:22.041]  Get the juggler!
[02:10:33.916 --> 02:10:34.636]  They're making their move.
[02:10:35.857 --> 02:10:38.598]  So, China, we're at war with China and the traitors.
[02:10:39.199 --> 02:10:44.141]  And how do we get it across the average leftist or America-hater that, hey, China's really doing this.
[02:10:44.161 --> 02:10:45.182]  We're really being sold out.
[02:10:45.362 --> 02:10:47.103]  They'll just laugh at you and say, yeah, I know.
[02:10:47.183 --> 02:10:47.543]  So what?
[02:10:47.563 --> 02:10:48.263]  America sucks.
[02:10:48.863 --> 02:10:50.464]  The CFR calls it the Chinese century.
[02:10:50.484 --> 02:10:52.045]  I mean, the communist Chinese century.
[02:10:56.747 --> 02:10:57.888]  So we're going to talk about that topic.
[02:10:59.164 --> 02:11:02.345]  The total treason going on in Congress against the President.
[02:11:03.125 --> 02:11:05.686]  Inside the White House, hundreds and hundreds of people in there.
[02:11:05.966 --> 02:11:09.888]  People are sticking stickers on his back, saying he's Mr. Dumbass.
[02:11:10.368 --> 02:11:13.749]  They're putting signs above the door that say, Entering Crazy Town.
[02:11:14.769 --> 02:11:19.731]  And it's all a bunch of people vitriolically whipped up and then CNN goes, see, 25th Amendment.
[02:11:21.448 --> 02:11:22.049]  He's unfit.
[02:11:22.089 --> 02:11:23.190]  He can't lead the White House.
[02:11:23.290 --> 02:11:24.030]  It's in disarray.
[02:11:24.291 --> 02:11:29.875]  Well, he's got some of his policies through, despite being up there on the parapet surrounded by enemies.
[02:11:31.897 --> 02:11:33.979]  And that shows how great a president this guy is.
[02:11:34.039 --> 02:11:38.483]  And this is the perfect leftist, limp-wristed, you know, nanny-state coup.
[02:11:38.543 --> 02:11:43.728]  It's a bunch of whining, bitching people, nipping at his heels, sticking stickers on his back.
[02:11:45.449 --> 02:11:47.211]  It's all Arrested Development weirdness.
[02:11:48.971 --> 02:11:50.733]  They'd be executed in China for that.
[02:11:51.233 --> 02:11:51.994]  But they don't care.
[02:11:52.814 --> 02:11:57.859]  They just go along with state-run media in the swamp, and they all are scared for working for Trump.
[02:11:57.899 --> 02:12:01.462]  They all get threatened, and they all get told, we know about you not paying taxes.
[02:12:04.625 --> 02:12:05.646]  We know about all this.
[02:12:07.868 --> 02:12:12.212]  And so you better roll over to us, or we're going to set you up.
[02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:17.220]  You got a bunch of cowards.
[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:18.841]  So people ask, well, why do you do this?
[02:12:18.881 --> 02:12:21.742]  Because other people stood up and that's why we have freedom.
[02:12:22.122 --> 02:12:24.843]  When you don't, you become a communist China or a Venezuela.
[02:12:27.824 --> 02:12:36.307]  And so it's in my DNA, when I'm facing a bunch of tyrants and a bunch of dishonorable scum, they're blind to being honorable.
[02:12:36.347 --> 02:12:37.428]  They're blind to strength.
[02:12:37.688 --> 02:12:43.030]  They're blind to my genetic line being very honorable people.
[02:12:45.447 --> 02:12:47.188]  And by the way, winners, super winners.
[02:12:48.169 --> 02:12:49.189]  And you just don't get it.
[02:12:49.509 --> 02:12:52.531]  We built the good civilization, the open, free society.
[02:12:53.011 --> 02:12:54.372]  We're the true liberals, not you.
[02:12:55.513 --> 02:12:58.114]  And you think we're fools because we're not sociopaths like you.
[02:12:59.655 --> 02:13:00.535]  So there's that issue.
[02:13:00.655 --> 02:13:06.219]  They're obviously preparing a false flag against me and Trump, saying everywhere we're going to cause violence against the media while they hype the violence.
[02:13:06.279 --> 02:13:07.920]  What do we do about that with 57 days left?
[02:13:13.826 --> 02:13:15.827]  It's just an incredible time to be alive right now.
[02:13:17.088 --> 02:13:17.868]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:13:17.888 --> 02:13:18.589]  And then the hurricane.
[02:13:18.609 --> 02:13:19.769]  I want to talk about the hurricane.
[02:13:19.789 --> 02:13:21.790]  There'll be a cat 6 coming in.
[02:13:21.810 --> 02:13:22.871]  We're going to get into all of that.
[02:13:24.232 --> 02:13:25.452]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[02:13:25.472 --> 02:13:25.512]  877-789-2539.
[02:13:31.308 --> 02:13:40.272]  First-time callers, or if you called before but didn't get through, obviously last week those folks got to the head of the line, got on last week and then got put on hold.
[02:13:40.352 --> 02:13:43.934]  I think it's everybody, 877-789-ALEX.
[02:13:44.474 --> 02:13:45.035]  I want to hear from you.
[02:13:45.055 --> 02:13:46.355]  We'll go right to your calls next segment.
[02:13:47.516 --> 02:13:48.256]  But I want to play this.
[02:13:48.896 --> 02:13:52.598]  Maxine Waters is back at it again with her impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[02:13:53.278 --> 02:13:55.660]  And like Trump said last week, let's cue that up too if we can.
[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.060]  I never got to that.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:00.542]  He said in a speech, he's being very honest, he said, you better vote or I could get impeached.
[02:14:02.090 --> 02:14:07.275]  And he goes, I don't know why we got a 4.2, it's about to be 4.8 growth rate and everything's turning around.
[02:14:07.295 --> 02:14:11.358]  He goes, I told you, you know, cut taxes and cut regulations and say we're open for business again.
[02:14:11.378 --> 02:14:14.101]  And you know, I really believe in you, but they're coming after me.
[02:14:14.141 --> 02:14:15.302]  He goes, I don't know why they are.
[02:14:16.102 --> 02:14:17.924]  And he goes, I don't know what they'll do if they get rid of me.
[02:14:18.044 --> 02:14:21.807]  I mean, well, that's a whole nother topic if they kill him.
[02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:28.893]  So let's go ahead and go to the latest from Mad Maxine Waters.
[02:14:28.913 --> 02:14:29.214]  Here it is.
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:31.621]  I say I'm in this fight.
[02:14:32.622 --> 02:14:34.684]  I'm in this fight and I'm not going to move.
[02:14:34.924 --> 02:14:41.209]  And, as you know, there's a difference in how some of our leadership talk about how we should handle all of this.
[02:14:41.489 --> 02:14:44.031]  They say, Maxine, please don't say impeachment anymore.
[02:14:44.771 --> 02:14:53.558]  And when they say that, I say impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment, impeachment.
[02:14:54.299 --> 02:14:54.459]  Wow.
[02:14:54.499 --> 02:14:56.721]  By the way, we have Clyde Lewis on.
[02:14:56.781 --> 02:14:57.561]  I've heard the show a lot.
[02:14:57.581 --> 02:14:59.323]  It's a big syndicated show because I'm before George Norrie.
[02:15:00.111 --> 02:15:05.074]  On the Coast to Coast Network, but he's really smart about the takeover plan, the CIA offices.
[02:15:05.394 --> 02:15:08.615]  He reminded me of some stuff I'd forgotten about the Internet Kill Switch.
[02:15:08.956 --> 02:15:10.977]  He's on tomorrow for, I think, two hours.
[02:15:11.017 --> 02:15:12.317]  And then we've got Eric Bolling.
[02:15:12.898 --> 02:15:14.038]  Ran into him at Trump Hotel.
[02:15:14.499 --> 02:15:18.120]  He's coming in to be interviewed, and I'm going to be interviewed by him for his CRTV stuff he's doing.
[02:15:18.461 --> 02:15:22.023]  So Eric Bolling was talking to him about his son.
[02:15:22.043 --> 02:15:24.084]  He got tears in his eyes talking about his son.
[02:15:26.144 --> 02:15:28.127]  He mentioned his son, all of a sudden tears were in his eyes.
[02:15:28.708 --> 02:15:32.353]  So he's going to be in studio with us as well on Wednesday, if we're even here.
[02:15:32.733 --> 02:15:40.925]  Because I'll be honest with you, I mean, every day we're on the air now is pretty precious because they keep escalating and it's not taking us off air.
[02:15:41.526 --> 02:15:42.066]  And so now...
[02:15:43.533 --> 02:15:45.475]  They're moving into some other areas.
[02:15:46.356 --> 02:15:47.697]  And people say, wow, doesn't that scare you?
[02:15:47.757 --> 02:15:49.058]  No, it makes me know I was right.
[02:15:49.459 --> 02:15:51.761]  And I've got to be all in now and really man up.
[02:15:52.542 --> 02:15:58.788]  To not man up from fear, man up to have energy and professionalism to really give this a good ending.
[02:15:59.528 --> 02:16:03.572]  It may be the end, but we've got to finish strong.
[02:16:03.592 --> 02:16:08.557]  33% of the population of the US, that's two out of every three people you're looking at,
[02:16:09.346 --> 02:16:12.808]  carry staph aureus bacteria in their nose.
[02:16:13.509 --> 02:16:19.432]  Two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin-resistant staph.
[02:16:19.952 --> 02:16:25.736]  Now what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than AIDS.
[02:16:26.156 --> 02:16:34.521]  And so what we do is we work really hard, did massive amounts of research, and we found that our gel, your gel,
[02:16:35.561 --> 02:16:37.842]  As a first line of defense, it's amazing.
[02:16:37.922 --> 02:16:46.266]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that will last up to three days.
[02:16:47.026 --> 02:16:53.570]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph, E. coli, Candida, Aspergillus niger, in minutes.
[02:16:54.390 --> 02:17:00.453]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:11.068]  And ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a methicillin-resistant staph bacteria, from that soccer field.
[02:17:11.729 --> 02:17:19.836]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephones, in subways.
[02:17:20.576 --> 02:17:30.805]  And this gel that you have access to is the first line of defense for everybody to be able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria.
[02:17:31.105 --> 02:17:43.176]  You gel it up and you don't worry about it because we have heal rate of about half the normal time and you actually have something now in your house where you can easily take care of it.
[02:17:43.826 --> 02:17:56.475]  I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time because explain why the super silver wound gel dressing from Infowarslife.com that we've probably labeled from your top of the line, your top selling product nationwide, why is it so special?
[02:17:56.955 --> 02:18:05.682]  These studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes down 24 hours with no negative effect on any system in your body.
[02:18:06.122 --> 02:18:08.844]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[02:18:09.628 --> 02:18:10.369]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:19.275]  Over-the-counter, which is what you have, available to your people, is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[02:18:19.536 --> 02:18:22.298]  You have one of the only products in the U.S.
[02:18:22.338 --> 02:18:26.401]  that can, like, make a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[02:18:26.781 --> 02:18:32.666]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about, probably, three or four minutes.
[02:18:33.286 --> 02:18:36.147]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[02:18:36.267 --> 02:18:40.229]  What a blessing to have something that you have in your house right now.
[02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:42.669]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this.
[02:18:42.869 --> 02:18:55.414]  So hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were caused in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[02:18:56.134 --> 02:19:01.598]  That's why they're going back to the silver products, because our silver is proven to kill, though.
[02:19:02.158 --> 02:19:08.523]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are Methicillin-resistant Staph, and one called VRE.
[02:19:08.643 --> 02:19:13.246]  And VRE is Ventomycin-resistant Enterococcus Fecalis.
[02:19:13.446 --> 02:19:15.867]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:19.350]  And so the cool part is, this gel kills it in minutes.
[02:19:20.050 --> 02:19:29.498]  So you don't have to worry about your kids getting an amputation or wound or you don't have to have, you know, a funeral for somebody you love.
[02:19:29.518 --> 02:19:41.708]  And the bottom line is you guys did years and years and years and years and years and years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies and you finally found out the perfect silver, the most effective, and it's available at InfoWarsTore.com and you helped save the country and
[02:19:41.988 --> 02:19:43.368]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:33.763 --> 02:20:34.524]  I want to be clear.
[02:20:34.964 --> 02:20:35.985]  Alex Jones, we're back live.
[02:20:36.005 --> 02:20:36.605]  Please join us.
[02:20:39.468 --> 02:20:46.313]  You have Democrats everywhere saying kill Republicans, kill Trump, kill me in the news today, in Newsday.
[02:20:47.735 --> 02:20:50.076]  You have them allied with Communist China.
[02:20:50.157 --> 02:20:56.762]  You have China with Google and Apple moving there and Google this year in July saying we're not going to work with the Pentagon anymore.
[02:20:56.782 --> 02:20:58.684]  We're going to give all our AI to China.
[02:20:59.687 --> 02:21:03.470]  Those are all litmus tests by China to go totally tax-exempt.
[02:21:04.410 --> 02:21:06.612]  They won't have to move their money around the world to be tax-exempt.
[02:21:06.972 --> 02:21:08.873]  They're making the authoritarian plunge.
[02:21:10.775 --> 02:21:12.696]  And they're censoring at the same time.
[02:21:13.797 --> 02:21:21.242]  So when I say this could be the end of Infowars, I mean the end of the country, the end of Trump, the end of prosperity, the end of your speech.
[02:21:21.262 --> 02:21:21.782]  You understand?
[02:21:22.122 --> 02:21:23.243]  But I don't mean my end.
[02:21:23.543 --> 02:21:24.564]  I mean our end.
[02:21:30.834 --> 02:21:38.056]  That is a very conservative assessment of where we are and what these people are trying to do.
[02:21:39.457 --> 02:21:56.502]  And you watch the weird frenzy of the minions of this system that couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag, that have become fat and lazy and stupid on the largesse of American freedom, then working with every foreign corrupt organization and institution
[02:21:57.811 --> 02:22:03.855]  Against the country, because it's the only place they'd be allowed to act like that and operate like that.
[02:22:03.895 --> 02:22:05.657]  So I'm asking callers, what do we do about that?
[02:22:08.358 --> 02:22:14.943]  I said this morning on a couple phone calls to people, I said there really isn't anything Trump couldn't do legally and lawfully at this point.
[02:22:15.483 --> 02:22:16.724]  They're working with foreign powers.
[02:22:16.744 --> 02:22:18.045]  They're trying to overthrow the election.
[02:22:18.766 --> 02:22:20.207]  They're anti-free speech tyrants.
[02:22:23.309 --> 02:22:25.891]  Trump legitimately could arrest
[02:22:27.369 --> 02:22:30.391]  The heads of the Democratic Party, all these people that have been involved in this.
[02:22:31.212 --> 02:22:32.593]  But he doesn't have the Justice Department.
[02:22:32.653 --> 02:22:46.742]  I mean, George Washington, say in his first administration, if something like this was going on, he would fix bayonets and march with the army and grab these people.
[02:22:48.604 --> 02:22:49.584]  Because they're not Americans.
[02:22:49.965 --> 02:22:51.546]  They're traitors like Benedict Arnold.
[02:22:52.695 --> 02:22:55.016]  And they're the ones saying they're coming after us.
[02:22:55.176 --> 02:22:56.936]  They're the ones saying they're going to kill us.
[02:22:57.296 --> 02:22:59.736]  They're the ones allied with the biggest mass murderers in history.
[02:23:03.797 --> 02:23:07.238]  So, we told you they're into children's blood.
[02:23:07.738 --> 02:23:08.818]  We told you they're devil worshippers.
[02:23:08.858 --> 02:23:09.778]  We told you they're pedophiles.
[02:23:09.998 --> 02:23:10.719]  It's all coming out.
[02:23:12.059 --> 02:23:13.079]  These are bad people.
[02:23:13.099 --> 02:23:13.759]  Here's another article.
[02:23:14.779 --> 02:23:17.220]  Young blood can be the secret to long-lasting life.
[02:23:17.320 --> 02:23:17.760]  Health study.
[02:23:18.749 --> 02:23:19.750]  What are the elites into?
[02:23:20.730 --> 02:23:21.291]  Children's blood.
[02:23:22.371 --> 02:23:22.911]  Intervenously.
[02:23:23.812 --> 02:23:24.372]  These are vampires.
[02:23:25.073 --> 02:23:31.196]  And just everything I've told you over the years is all coming true and being admitted, or is all out in the open now, and that's why they had to get rid of our YouTube channel.
[02:23:32.597 --> 02:23:36.800]  We had videos on there on every subject that just kept getting confirmed.
[02:23:39.141 --> 02:23:45.365]  The last few weeks of videos we're going to upload, very soon to InfoWars, and to Real.Video,
[02:23:46.909 --> 02:23:51.733]  Because you watch it and I'm laying out everything before they ban us that's now in the news.
[02:23:52.254 --> 02:23:52.534]  All of it.
[02:23:53.735 --> 02:23:54.796]  And that's what freaks them out.
[02:23:54.816 --> 02:23:57.218]  They go, this guy knows exactly what we're up to.
[02:23:57.599 --> 02:23:58.079]  Get rid of him.
[02:24:02.463 --> 02:24:04.345]  Now, I'm gonna go to your calls, as I said.
[02:24:04.365 --> 02:24:07.928]  And I specifically want to get into these topics.
[02:24:14.209 --> 02:24:16.051]  Let's go, we're gonna go to Dan, then we're gonna go to Justin.
[02:24:16.571 --> 02:24:18.292]  Dan in Canada, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[02:24:19.353 --> 02:24:23.617]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to say it's one of the great honors of my life to be able to speak to you.
[02:24:23.637 --> 02:24:24.518]  I've been listening since 2003.
[02:24:25.618 --> 02:24:30.623]  I was a high school student then, and I'm a young man in his early 30s now, a total patriot.
[02:24:30.643 --> 02:24:32.084]  We support you up here in Canada.
[02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:42.485]  And I wanted to remind you and all the info warriors out there that the spirit of humanity is rising and that in these matters we're doing a lot of practical things.
[02:24:42.545 --> 02:24:44.328]  Hashtag WalkAway is brilliant.
[02:24:44.793 --> 02:24:56.522]  There's brilliant ways to educate yourself out there, like The Killing of Uncle Sam, an amazing book that'll get you up to speed on the history of the occult and the globalists and what their ultimate plan for domination was.
[02:24:56.622 --> 02:25:02.306]  But I also want to stress, maybe most importantly, that in all of these matters, the battle is the Lord.
[02:25:02.326 --> 02:25:03.687]  In Deuteronomy 32, 30 and 31, it says,
[02:25:06.209 --> 02:25:09.650]  How can one take on a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight?
[02:25:09.950 --> 02:25:16.751]  For their rock, with a small r, is not like our rock, with a capital R. Jesus Christ, the solid rock on which we stand.
[02:25:17.111 --> 02:25:19.552]  If one prays, we can tackle a thousand demons.
[02:25:19.892 --> 02:25:22.653]  If two prays, we can tackle ten thousand demons.
[02:25:22.673 --> 02:25:25.233]  And if we continue to pray, that number grows exponentially.
[02:25:25.253 --> 02:25:29.234]  And there were thousands, millions, thousands, tens of millions of people
[02:25:29.984 --> 02:25:33.249]  On their knees, on election night, praying for Donald Trump.
[02:25:33.309 --> 02:25:34.131]  And it moved mountains.
[02:25:34.251 --> 02:25:35.032]  It absolutely moved mountains.
[02:25:35.052 --> 02:25:35.272]  No, I agree.
[02:25:35.292 --> 02:25:36.414]  We need prayer worldwide.
[02:25:36.434 --> 02:25:37.576]  You talk about election meddling.
[02:25:37.896 --> 02:25:40.840]  There's video of David Hogg saying, you know, get Canadians to give money or whatever.
[02:25:40.920 --> 02:25:41.762]  Michael Moore knows how to get into that.
[02:25:42.042 --> 02:25:44.165]  But how about election meddling, praying to God?
[02:25:44.406 --> 02:25:44.926]  That's legal.
[02:25:45.527 --> 02:25:49.588]  Everybody around the world should be praying for a huge landslide for these Republicans.
[02:25:50.048 --> 02:25:51.868]  I know Ted Cruz wasn't perfect during the campaign.
[02:25:51.888 --> 02:25:52.768]  He did some bad things.
[02:25:53.308 --> 02:25:56.409]  But he is light years better than Beto, who's a total snake.
[02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:58.349]  And they're going to try to steal it in Texas.
[02:25:58.369 --> 02:26:00.170]  They want to turn the state putrid blue.
[02:26:00.590 --> 02:26:03.290]  We've got to vote for Ted Cruz in Texas.
[02:26:03.450 --> 02:26:03.970]  Everybody.
[02:26:04.350 --> 02:26:05.511]  I'm going to go out and vote for him.
[02:26:05.531 --> 02:26:06.691]  You need to go out and vote for him.
[02:26:07.331 --> 02:26:09.291]  Everybody needs to vote for Ted Cruz.
[02:26:09.431 --> 02:26:10.051]  Everybody else.
[02:26:10.412 --> 02:26:12.352]  Ted Cruz is a great voting record.
[02:26:13.333 --> 02:26:17.299]  And he did some slimy stuff in the campaign because he got hooked up with Glenn Beck, but you know what?
[02:26:17.620 --> 02:26:18.401]  I forgive him that.
[02:26:18.802 --> 02:26:21.486]  We need to aggressively support Ted Cruz.
[02:26:22.508 --> 02:26:25.032]  People need to absolutely get behind him a million percent.
[02:26:25.052 --> 02:26:25.813]  Dan, God bless you.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:33.584]  I was having dinner with my mom and my children and some of her friends that I've known since I was a little kid, and we were talking about how they've been listening for years.
[02:26:33.624 --> 02:26:38.827]  Now when I really started calling on the name of Christ and everything, the last decade or so, is when they really started coming after me.
[02:26:38.867 --> 02:26:49.353]  Because I used to kind of leave the show, I wouldn't say secular, I had pastors on and stuff, and didn't make it a secret that I was a Christian, but I began to get more and more people to point out, that's the spiritual fight.
[02:26:49.933 --> 02:26:51.614]  We're dealing with devil worshipers.
[02:26:52.731 --> 02:26:59.058]  And I didn't like you think about in some kind of a book or something or you know, you know, movie.
[02:26:59.979 --> 02:27:01.381]  It's energetic, it's spiritual.
[02:27:02.542 --> 02:27:06.006]  And they're feeding on children, they're feeding on America, they're feeding on strength.
[02:27:06.567 --> 02:27:07.948]  They like bad things.
[02:27:08.048 --> 02:27:09.970]  They've tuned into something very wicked.
[02:27:10.951 --> 02:27:12.794]  We're gonna go to break, come back and hurry through your calls.
[02:27:13.933 --> 02:27:15.635]  I'm going to get to a lot of calls next segment.
[02:27:15.655 --> 02:27:28.628]  That was a powerful caller and more on Hurricane Florence rapidly intensifying like it did in North or South Carolina Thursday as a category six from weather underground and their meteorologists there as well.
[02:27:29.368 --> 02:27:31.731]  Finally, as I like to say before we go to break,
[02:27:34.246 --> 02:27:36.008]  We have the ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:27:36.188 --> 02:27:39.151]  It's 95% curcuminoid.
[02:27:39.351 --> 02:27:40.372]  Nobody else has that.
[02:27:40.392 --> 02:27:42.475]  We want top firms in the country to make it.
[02:27:43.316 --> 02:27:45.057]  We put a lot of money into each bottle.
[02:27:45.318 --> 02:27:51.224]  If you don't know what turmeric does, and we've got a bunch of other herbs that supercharge it, research it.
[02:27:52.065 --> 02:27:56.670]  It does better for me personally if I have a sprain or other things than Advil.
[02:27:57.811 --> 02:27:59.033]  And Advil works pretty darn well.
[02:27:59.953 --> 02:28:01.275]  But it's an anti-inflammatory.
[02:28:01.355 --> 02:28:02.076]  So many great things.
[02:28:02.096 --> 02:28:03.037]  It's great for your brain.
[02:28:03.637 --> 02:28:09.123]  So many of these problems people have with their brains and allergies and things is the inflammation.
[02:28:11.404 --> 02:28:16.289]  It was Rob Doolick a year and a half ago, he goes, dude, I take turmeric for my allergies, it knocks it out.
[02:28:16.469 --> 02:28:17.730]  Don't you know that?
[02:28:17.770 --> 02:28:19.131]  I started taking it, it was like really helping.
[02:28:19.772 --> 02:28:21.533]  Like way better than like Claritin and stuff.
[02:28:21.814 --> 02:28:28.239]  Because it massively reduces inflammation, does a bunch of other stuff, but it's the last day at 50% off.
[02:28:28.259 --> 02:28:31.182]  We're about to sell it anyways, more doesn't come in for like a month.
[02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:33.044]  So if you want bodies, infowarestore.com.
[02:28:33.064 --> 02:28:33.985]  It's gotta be the last day of the day.
[02:28:34.245 --> 02:28:36.347]  There will be new specials tomorrow, I just haven't had time to come up with them.
[02:28:36.767 --> 02:28:38.889]  I'm busier than a one-legged man in a you-know-what contest.
[02:28:39.990 --> 02:28:41.872]  And we've got the ultimate bone broth.
[02:28:41.972 --> 02:28:42.973]  That's going to end today.
[02:28:42.993 --> 02:28:43.854]  50% off.
[02:28:43.934 --> 02:28:44.454]  It's amazing.
[02:28:44.494 --> 02:28:45.015]  Check it out.

[02:28:47.537 --> 02:28:49.819]  We've got a big announcement tomorrow about X2.
[02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:51.300]  I'll just make it now.
[02:28:52.602 --> 02:28:53.202]  It's official.
[02:28:53.963 --> 02:28:54.744]  No more X2.
[02:28:54.864 --> 02:28:55.905]  What we have is what we have.
[02:28:56.986 --> 02:28:57.206]  Yep.
[02:28:57.226 --> 02:28:57.406]  X2.
[02:28:57.446 --> 02:28:58.187]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:05.043 --> 02:29:06.864]  Blessers in the United States and around the world.
[02:29:07.244 --> 02:29:09.266]  You've seen InfoWars deliver the goods.
[02:29:09.486 --> 02:29:11.547]  You've seen us get Trump into office thanks to your help.
[02:29:12.428 --> 02:29:21.974]  You've seen us expose the web censorship and make it the top priority now of the President to defend the First Amendment and win these midterms and stop Big Tech's reign of terror.
[02:29:23.095 --> 02:29:26.717]  You have seen the fact that we've got the zeitgeist because we've got you.
[02:29:27.598 --> 02:29:28.318]  You are the power.
[02:29:28.879 --> 02:29:29.679]  You are the fulcrum.
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:31.040]  You are the engine.
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:33.382]  The blood, sweat, gut, tears, brain.
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:34.781]  I think?
[02:29:51.243 --> 02:29:54.104]  We've got supplements that, just like our information, is totally game-changing.
[02:29:54.144 --> 02:29:55.545]  That is so amazing.
[02:29:55.565 --> 02:30:00.166]  We've got the strongest known turmeric formula that we can find any top company to put out.
[02:30:00.266 --> 02:30:00.807]  It's amazing.
[02:30:01.167 --> 02:30:05.668]  Bodies, even though it's about to sell out in the next week or so, we have it 50% off.
[02:30:05.988 --> 02:30:06.229]  Get it.
[02:30:06.489 --> 02:30:10.490]  Experience what it does for your health, your stamina, your anti-inflammation.
[02:30:10.810 --> 02:30:11.971]  It really helps me with allergies.
[02:30:12.711 --> 02:30:13.731]  And just so many other things.
[02:30:14.011 --> 02:30:14.932]  Infowarsandlife.com.
[02:30:16.496 --> 02:30:17.337]  This is where you can go visit.
[02:30:17.737 --> 02:30:27.083]  When you make the decision to go to mfl.com and get the water filtration, the air filtration, the 40% off on our great natural sleep aid knockout.
[02:30:27.624 --> 02:30:29.885]  When you do that, it changes the world.
[02:30:29.925 --> 02:30:32.867]  You get great products and you support our broadcast.
[02:30:32.887 --> 02:30:35.309]  So I want to thank you all, again, that have supported us.
[02:30:36.570 --> 02:30:38.311]  And I want to encourage all of you that have been on the fence.
[02:30:38.691 --> 02:30:39.692]  You know we're telling the truth.
[02:30:39.752 --> 02:30:40.693]  You know we're changing the world.
[02:30:40.713 --> 02:30:41.313]  This isn't hype.
[02:30:41.393 --> 02:30:45.416]  We need you to get off the bench and come into this historical win.
[02:30:46.912 --> 02:30:55.415]  And get books and get t-shirts and get videos that help inform yourself and others better, that help spread the word, that help you meet like-minded people.
[02:30:56.796 --> 02:30:59.176]  Bottom line, there is a war going on for humanity.
[02:30:59.316 --> 02:31:00.557]  That is the final equation.
[02:31:00.617 --> 02:31:05.399]  There is a war for the future of our destiny, and right now is the time for everybody to get off the bench and get in the game.
[02:31:05.419 --> 02:31:07.539]  So I want to thank those that have been off the bench in the game.
[02:31:08.100 --> 02:31:11.541]  I want to ask those that have been in the game some, but not as much as they could, to get more in the game.
[02:31:12.061 --> 02:31:14.042]  And I want to ask those that have not been in the game,
[02:31:14.682 --> 02:31:17.747]  So whatever you do, spread the articles at InfoWars.com, the videos.
[02:31:18.127 --> 02:31:20.571]  Download them, re-upload them, share them.
[02:31:20.591 --> 02:31:22.994]  They're trying to stop us because we're having an effect, thanks to you.
[02:31:23.635 --> 02:31:29.144]  So again, I want to salute you all and thank you all, and ask you to think about InfoWars every day, because without you, we're nothing.
[02:31:29.424 --> 02:31:29.684]  Thank you.

[02:32:06.869 --> 02:32:09.951]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[02:32:09.991 --> 02:32:10.512]  You're on the air.
[02:32:10.532 --> 02:32:11.072]  Thanks for holding.
[02:32:11.472 --> 02:32:12.533]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:32:12.794 --> 02:32:13.374]  Hey, brother.
[02:32:13.674 --> 02:32:14.034]  Good, man.
[02:32:14.074 --> 02:32:14.875]  Thank you for calling.
[02:32:14.955 --> 02:32:15.175]  Hey.
[02:32:15.235 --> 02:32:15.516]  Hey.
[02:32:15.616 --> 02:32:20.019]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[02:32:20.219 --> 02:32:26.584]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Violent Defense, Micro ZX.
[02:32:26.604 --> 02:32:28.425]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[02:32:28.525 --> 02:32:35.351]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[02:32:35.811 --> 02:32:36.952]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[02:32:36.992 --> 02:32:39.433]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[02:32:39.493 --> 02:32:41.014]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[02:32:41.395 --> 02:32:43.016]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[02:32:43.456 --> 02:32:44.196]  And exactly.
[02:32:44.216 --> 02:32:48.519]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[02:32:48.819 --> 02:32:49.080]  Boom!
[02:32:49.220 --> 02:32:52.061]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[02:32:52.101 --> 02:32:52.642]  It's amazing.
[02:32:52.702 --> 02:32:54.003]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[02:32:54.063 --> 02:32:57.065]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[02:33:06.278 --> 02:33:13.564]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.604 --> 02:33:16.486]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[02:33:16.506 --> 02:33:24.813]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[02:33:25.274 --> 02:33:27.736]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[02:33:27.756 --> 02:33:29.217]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[02:33:29.537 --> 02:33:31.439]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[02:33:31.699 --> 02:33:33.802]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[02:33:34.062 --> 02:33:35.123]  This is all confirmed.
[02:33:35.143 --> 02:33:36.104]  This is not a drill.
[02:33:36.244 --> 02:33:40.188]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[02:33:40.528 --> 02:33:41.930]  They've officially become state-run.
[02:33:42.070 --> 02:33:42.531]  Apple 100%.
[02:33:42.931 --> 02:33:48.557]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[02:33:48.997 --> 02:33:53.781]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[02:33:54.081 --> 02:33:54.941]  This is happening.
[02:33:54.961 --> 02:34:02.887]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[02:34:02.987 --> 02:34:08.892]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[02:34:09.332 --> 02:34:17.318]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:34:18.178 --> 02:34:21.721]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:34:21.781 --> 02:34:25.224]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:34:25.524 --> 02:34:32.549]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:34:32.769 --> 02:34:35.451]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:34:35.491 --> 02:34:40.755]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[02:34:41.036 --> 02:34:43.698]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[02:34:44.258 --> 02:34:56.732]  Attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program, and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chai Com slash Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[02:34:57.033 --> 02:35:02.178]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[02:35:03.299 --> 02:35:12.026]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:35:12.046 --> 02:35:16.910]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:35:17.310 --> 02:35:22.194]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a murderer of children.
[02:35:22.534 --> 02:35:30.219]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:37.485]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:35:37.585 --> 02:35:43.289]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[02:35:43.509 --> 02:35:48.232]  Only your full understanding of this TV will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:35:48.252 --> 02:35:50.254]  I have given you the transmission!
[02:35:55.098 --> 02:36:03.809]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:05.651]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:36:05.871 --> 02:36:11.318]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:36:17.418 --> 02:36:19.820]  Alright, we're going back to your phone calls right now.
[02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:22.081]  We've got Sean, let's talk about censorship.
[02:36:22.161 --> 02:36:25.784]  Justin, Michael, Joel, Travis, Cole, CJ.
[02:36:25.804 --> 02:36:27.565]  I don't see any ladies on here.
[02:36:27.585 --> 02:36:30.087]  Sometimes it's like all women calls, sometimes it's all men, sometimes it's a mix.
[02:36:30.828 --> 02:36:32.149]  We've got a lot of callers here.
[02:36:32.169 --> 02:36:36.151]  Let's talk to Joel in San Diego, California.
[02:36:36.712 --> 02:36:37.352]  Joel, you're on the air.
[02:36:37.392 --> 02:36:38.013]  Thanks for calling.
[02:36:38.773 --> 02:36:39.414]  Alrighty, Alex.
[02:36:39.434 --> 02:36:40.074]  How you doing, brother?
[02:36:40.174 --> 02:36:40.354]  Good.
[02:36:40.374 --> 02:36:40.915]  Thanks for calling.
[02:36:42.219 --> 02:36:42.619]  Thank you.
[02:36:42.639 --> 02:36:44.921]  I want to say a couple things first before I get into it.
[02:36:45.582 --> 02:36:46.443]  I'm calling through the app.
[02:36:46.683 --> 02:36:47.404]  I love the app, man.
[02:36:47.424 --> 02:36:48.325]  The new app is amazing.
[02:36:48.385 --> 02:36:50.467]  I had the old one, which was a little buggy.
[02:36:50.907 --> 02:36:51.668]  New one's awesome.
[02:36:51.688 --> 02:36:53.630]  I'm glad I got it on iPhone before they took it off.
[02:36:54.391 --> 02:37:01.258]  And by the way, they banned a whole bunch of apps that weren't even ours, that were fan apps, off of the Apple platform.
[02:37:01.298 --> 02:37:02.158]  A total purge.
[02:37:03.059 --> 02:37:05.363]  Some just had my name in it, it wasn't even me.
[02:37:06.564 --> 02:37:17.799]  And again, millions got the Apple one, 800,000 or something got the Google one that's still available at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:37:17.859 --> 02:37:18.600]  But think about that.
[02:37:18.620 --> 02:37:20.222]  Yes, if you have it, it's still there for now.
[02:37:21.263 --> 02:37:24.304]  Until, I guess, a few updates happen, but how amazing is that?
[02:37:24.845 --> 02:37:33.549]  That's true digital book burning, because that little icon we paid to have made and then paid them to put on their platform, they're saying this book isn't allowed in our library.
[02:37:33.569 --> 02:37:35.549]  I mean, that is real fascism.
[02:37:36.390 --> 02:37:38.811]  And people don't see it, and they don't see it because it's digital.
[02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:41.372]  They're not putting two and two together, really.
[02:37:41.932 --> 02:37:49.976]  Another thing I want to say is just what you were talking about earlier with that journalist that wrote that article, that really gets under my skin, man, because I've been a longtime listener, and
[02:37:52.045 --> 02:37:56.208]  The whole, you know, they take our kindness for weakness thing that you repeatedly say, that's so true.
[02:37:56.368 --> 02:37:59.151]  And just like the minute that they draw blood, they don't know what's going to happen to them.
[02:37:59.191 --> 02:38:00.091]  We've been nice.
[02:38:00.412 --> 02:38:01.472]  We've been really nice about this.
[02:38:01.973 --> 02:38:04.134]  Like, let them talk all the crap they want.
[02:38:05.175 --> 02:38:11.080]  Like, they're going to have to draw first blood, and if they think they can get away with stabbing you in the neck with a pen, it's just, it's blowing my mind what's going on right now.
[02:38:12.483 --> 02:38:14.345]  Well, William F.B.
[02:38:14.425 --> 02:38:16.006]  O'Reilly is a cowardly scumbag.
[02:38:16.387 --> 02:38:18.409]  He's not going to stab me with a pen.
[02:38:18.869 --> 02:38:21.612]  He's going to fantasize about it, hoping somebody does it.
[02:38:21.632 --> 02:38:26.176]  Just like the New York Times isn't going to go shoot Congressman Scalise and try to kill 17 others in the Freedom Caucus.
[02:38:26.196 --> 02:38:28.398]  They just said, oh, here's where they play baseball.
[02:38:28.939 --> 02:38:30.080]  No one's protecting them.
[02:38:31.541 --> 02:38:34.564]  Oh, here's where Alex's office is, you know, in North Austin.
[02:38:35.144 --> 02:38:35.665]  Come get them.
[02:38:36.706 --> 02:38:37.547]  That's what they do.
[02:38:39.257 --> 02:38:42.338]  You know, drawing blood, throwing coffee, doing their little scumbag game.
[02:38:42.358 --> 02:38:43.419]  Like you said, that's not drawing blood.
[02:38:43.579 --> 02:38:52.602]  But if they get some idiot to do this, like you're saying, I just already see that they're, you know, like you said, they've set you up so well that nobody will defend you when they do this.
[02:38:52.882 --> 02:38:55.963]  I'm going to defend you, and I know enough people that will, but this is craziness.
[02:38:56.563 --> 02:38:57.364]  Absolutely nuts right now.
[02:38:57.444 --> 02:38:59.524]  I'm sorry to hear that the X2 is going off the shelves, man.
[02:38:59.584 --> 02:39:03.926]  I live in California, so it's like impossible for me to really buy the products as much as I'd like to.
[02:39:05.231 --> 02:39:05.911]  That's one that I really like.
[02:39:05.931 --> 02:39:10.113]  Well, just so you know, the products ship anywhere in the world, and it passes all the California standards.
[02:39:10.193 --> 02:39:14.755]  And I've just been put over a barrel with getting the Deep Earth Crystal sources for the iodine.
[02:39:15.616 --> 02:39:20.038]  We may be able to come out with another iodine that's just as good at crystals or even better.
[02:39:20.478 --> 02:39:22.559]  It's just that that hasn't been totally secured yet.
[02:39:23.459 --> 02:39:25.140]  And so this has been our best-selling product.
[02:39:25.620 --> 02:39:32.844]  And we ended up getting it because they went after our deep seaweed, high-quality seaweed, when it wasn't as strong and wasn't as pure, but it was some of the best in the market.
[02:39:33.964 --> 02:39:38.566]  But this is the pure 9999999 stuff.
[02:39:38.586 --> 02:39:40.487]  4.9 stars on Power Reviews.
[02:39:40.507 --> 02:39:41.748]  6,000 plus reviews.
[02:39:42.528 --> 02:39:43.128]  98% reviews.
[02:39:43.169 --> 02:39:44.229]  It's an amazing product.
[02:39:44.609 --> 02:39:48.871]  And the X2 we've got right now is the last run.
[02:39:48.891 --> 02:39:54.334]  I had to break the contract for any future stuff just because of the prices going up and then the unavailability.
[02:39:55.485 --> 02:39:56.926]  And I told, you know, folks that.
[02:39:57.646 --> 02:40:01.708]  And so the X2 we have, we have a pretty good supply of it right now, but when it's sold out, it's gone.
[02:40:02.329 --> 02:40:07.351]  We may have a new formulae, but how that works is once you reformulate, you know, you have to change the name.
[02:40:07.772 --> 02:40:12.354]  And X2 could come back, but it's on an advertising tactic to say, oh my God, this is it.
[02:40:12.714 --> 02:40:14.075]  We've had a lot of problems keeping it in.
[02:40:14.095 --> 02:40:14.815]  We've had a lot of problems.
[02:40:15.095 --> 02:40:19.138]  Because once the oil companies know you want this, because they get it in the drilling process between 7 and 12,000 feet.
[02:40:22.361 --> 02:40:28.902]  Once they do that, and once that starts happening, then getting it from the oil and gas companies...
[02:40:29.881 --> 02:40:30.941]  Getting it supplied.
[02:40:30.961 --> 02:40:33.502]  Then the price goes up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[02:40:34.003 --> 02:40:35.663]  Then we've been looking for other suppliers.
[02:40:36.204 --> 02:40:37.304]  Then we thought we had one.
[02:40:37.324 --> 02:40:38.044]  Then it didn't.
[02:40:38.084 --> 02:40:41.105]  Then you've got to have a DEA license because it's a precursor for all this other stuff.
[02:40:41.606 --> 02:40:46.448]  Not DEA when we sell it, but I mean the original item we get is in a pure crystal form.
[02:40:46.468 --> 02:40:51.089]  Then it gases and it's put in by a patented process into the palm oil.
[02:40:51.470 --> 02:40:52.450]  That's why it's so special.
[02:40:52.490 --> 02:40:54.631]  But we've got it in stock and even though
[02:40:55.191 --> 02:40:58.172]  This is the final run with 4.9 stars.
[02:40:58.232 --> 02:40:59.293]  It's 25% off.
[02:40:59.673 --> 02:41:07.195]  So if you want to stock up on your X2, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:08.476 --> 02:41:11.597]  But last time, losing a supplier made us discover X2.
[02:41:12.377 --> 02:41:14.018]  And so that's how this stuff works.
[02:41:14.178 --> 02:41:21.080]  And I have a suspicion, though, that if we play hardball and stuff, the price will go down.
[02:41:21.701 --> 02:41:22.481]  Look, I just can't.
[02:41:25.825 --> 02:41:30.006]  I mean, most supplements literally that sell for $30 have $2 of product in them.
[02:41:30.627 --> 02:41:33.587]  Well, we got stuff that sells for $30 that's got $15 of product in it.
[02:41:34.847 --> 02:41:39.909]  But when it comes to things like DNA Force, it's got like $40 of product in it.
[02:41:41.309 --> 02:41:44.150]  Other people sell similar formulas for like $300 at doctor's offices.
[02:41:44.470 --> 02:41:45.430]  It's marked up seven times.
[02:41:46.325 --> 02:41:48.326]  The most we mark stuff up is like 150%.
[02:41:48.866 --> 02:41:54.147]  And we need to mark up the toothpaste like that, because if I sell it for $7-$8, there's $3 a product in it.
[02:41:54.567 --> 02:41:56.948]  Other people's toothpaste has like 50 cents a product.
[02:41:57.228 --> 02:41:59.248]  A bunch of sand and silicate.
[02:42:00.489 --> 02:42:02.109]  You know, that's not what we're doing.
[02:42:03.090 --> 02:42:05.810]  So, again, everything we do is the best.
[02:42:05.850 --> 02:42:06.410]  Game-changing.
[02:42:06.730 --> 02:42:07.711]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:42:08.091 --> 02:42:11.292]  You wanted to get into the media calling for attacks.
[02:42:11.332 --> 02:42:11.912]  Anything else, Joel?
[02:42:13.508 --> 02:42:13.869]  Uh, no.
[02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:17.035]  It's just very frustrating to me that they are able to get away with that.
[02:42:17.115 --> 02:42:21.143]  It's sort of... The two realities thing is becoming more and more apparent.
[02:42:21.163 --> 02:42:23.106]  They live in a fantasy land, and they're able to...
[02:42:24.229 --> 02:42:28.731]  You know, through their little echo chambers, justify what they're doing and saying, but it's a scary situation.
[02:42:28.791 --> 02:42:30.911]  I don't think enough people realize how scary this is right now.
[02:42:31.211 --> 02:42:40.775]  Well, I do have a message for Jack Dorsey later, because I talked to two different people that talked to folks that were involved in the meetings at Twitter and why I was actually removed.
[02:42:41.195 --> 02:42:46.137]  They used the excuse of Oliver Darcy to remove me from bullying a public figure that is right by free speech.
[02:42:46.977 --> 02:42:47.798]  So I stood up to a bully.
[02:42:47.818 --> 02:42:48.438]  He's my problem.
[02:42:49.139 --> 02:42:50.840]  It turns out it was for another reason.
[02:42:51.381 --> 02:42:54.783]  So I'll cover that at the start of the next hour when I introduce Gerald Cilente.
[02:42:54.803 --> 02:42:56.925]  But I'm coming back with your calls straight ahead.
[02:42:57.005 --> 02:42:58.066]  NewsWars.com.
[02:42:58.446 --> 02:42:59.427]  InfoWars.com.
[02:43:06.049 --> 02:43:07.470]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:43:07.510 --> 02:43:08.950]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:43:09.010 --> 02:43:09.370]  Go ahead.
[02:43:09.490 --> 02:43:09.770]  Yes.
[02:43:10.191 --> 02:43:10.931]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:11.031 --> 02:43:17.233]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:43:17.433 --> 02:43:21.415]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:43:21.655 --> 02:43:23.095]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:43:23.455 --> 02:43:30.158]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:43:30.238 --> 02:43:33.299]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:43:33.399 --> 02:43:36.801]  And I just ordered the body, the alpha power, and the pollen block.
[02:43:37.101 --> 02:43:38.682]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:43:38.722 --> 02:43:46.547]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:43:46.568 --> 02:43:52.391]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:43:52.511 --> 02:43:57.835]  It is our highest reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[02:43:57.935 --> 02:44:00.937]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:44:02.734 --> 02:44:07.457]  He's made it more popular, I think, to be openly racist.
[02:44:07.617 --> 02:44:12.701]  Because this president, I will quote Steve Schmidt, is a stone-cold racist.
[02:44:13.161 --> 02:44:14.942]  They must be really hitting this tone hard right now.
[02:44:14.962 --> 02:44:15.823]  That's the talking point.
[02:44:15.863 --> 02:44:16.303]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:16.463 --> 02:44:18.905]  So this is the reason... Trump just signed a thing that will save millions of people!
[02:44:19.165 --> 02:44:20.146]  RACIST!
[02:44:20.686 --> 02:44:21.587]  The economy's coming back!
[02:44:21.827 --> 02:44:22.988]  RACIST!
[02:44:23.368 --> 02:44:26.490]  All the numbers say the Republicans are going to win Congress in the midterms!
[02:44:26.650 --> 02:44:27.591]  RACIST!
[02:44:27.811 --> 02:44:31.793]  Oh my god, the giant blue wave, now a red wave, the historic Trump's dominating!
[02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:34.051]  Oh my gosh!
[02:44:34.071 --> 02:44:38.494]  The Obama administration is being exposed for all the illegal activity and the abuse of power!
[02:44:38.534 --> 02:44:39.935]  It must be racist!
[02:44:40.015 --> 02:44:42.778]  MS-13 can't torture little girls to death for Satan!
[02:44:42.898 --> 02:44:43.979]  Racist!
[02:44:44.059 --> 02:44:47.902]  You said Valerie Jarrett looks like the central casting for Planet of the Apes!
[02:44:47.982 --> 02:44:48.482]  Racist!
[02:44:48.722 --> 02:44:59.892]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:45:02.904 --> 02:45:05.204]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:45:05.244 --> 02:45:06.965]  We're really, really proud of it.
[02:45:07.405 --> 02:45:10.285]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[02:45:11.325 --> 02:45:22.387]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[02:45:22.827 --> 02:45:31.929]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture, Floralife, as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[02:45:32.429 --> 02:45:37.993]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[02:45:38.193 --> 02:45:43.356]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[02:45:43.636 --> 02:45:45.597]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[02:45:45.917 --> 02:45:46.458]  Buy these!
[02:45:47.058 --> 02:45:47.919]  Sold out in a month!
[02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:52.014]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[02:45:52.214 --> 02:45:53.596]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[02:45:54.237 --> 02:45:56.801]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[02:45:57.562 --> 02:45:59.525]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[02:46:00.086 --> 02:46:02.409]  Get yours today at fullwarslife.com.
[02:46:02.649 --> 02:46:03.511]  Living in Volcano.
[02:46:03.971 --> 02:46:06.074]  May sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:46:06.094 --> 02:46:09.358]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:46:09.879 --> 02:46:15.686]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:46:16.147 --> 02:46:18.930]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:46:19.651 --> 02:46:23.095]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:46:23.475 --> 02:46:29.542]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:46:29.963 --> 02:46:34.908]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:46:35.669 --> 02:46:39.071]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:46:39.591 --> 02:46:46.135]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:46:46.795 --> 02:46:51.477]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:46:52.018 --> 02:46:57.120]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:46:57.701 --> 02:47:01.663]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:47:06.224 --> 02:47:08.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:17.770 --> 02:47:18.291]  Oh, boy.
[02:47:18.311 --> 02:47:21.733]  I told you the false flags are coming against me.
[02:47:24.094 --> 02:47:24.534]  Too hot.
[02:47:24.594 --> 02:47:31.098]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:36.609 --> 02:47:37.390]  You knew it was coming.
[02:47:37.410 --> 02:47:44.352]  Miami Herald, anti-semitic flyers featuring Alex Jones, litter five California synagogues.
[02:47:47.053 --> 02:47:48.074]  You can pull this article up.
[02:47:48.134 --> 02:47:49.334]  I'll cover this later.
[02:47:49.394 --> 02:47:50.035]  Go ahead and grab it.
[02:47:50.055 --> 02:47:51.855]  And of course the media is acting like I did it.
[02:47:53.956 --> 02:48:01.519]  Almost all of these things where slosses get stuck on synagogues or Jewish cemeteries get attacked or done by leftists.
[02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:02.440]  Remember,
[02:48:03.362 --> 02:48:08.524]  Right after Trump got elected, somebody was attacking synagogues in New Jersey and knocking tombstones over.
[02:48:10.165 --> 02:48:12.006]  And Trump said, oh, I bet it stays.
[02:48:12.046 --> 02:48:16.287]  They went, oh my gosh, you don't care about Jews being attacked when he's pro-Israel.
[02:48:17.768 --> 02:48:19.829]  He is not pro-leftist garbage.
[02:48:20.749 --> 02:48:24.611]  And then even during his first speech in Congress, had to bring it up, so it's terrible.
[02:48:24.931 --> 02:48:28.733]  Turned out it was a leftist Jewish guy got caught doing it, pled guilty.
[02:48:29.633 --> 02:48:31.514]  Oh, but that was a little footnote that Trump was right.
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:37.384]  I don't know who's doing this, but I'm on everything.
[02:48:37.444 --> 02:48:38.164]  I'm in everything.
[02:48:38.224 --> 02:48:41.367]  So, they're always saying, you're going to cause violence.
[02:48:41.427 --> 02:48:43.589]  No, people that try to take free speech are going to cause violence.
[02:48:43.629 --> 02:48:44.089]  Not from me.
[02:48:45.650 --> 02:48:47.592]  To the Sacramento Bee, it's all over the place too.
[02:48:47.712 --> 02:48:49.213]  Anti-Semitic flyers featuring Alex Jones.
[02:48:49.634 --> 02:48:51.875]  Litter 5 California synagogues.
[02:48:53.937 --> 02:48:56.079]  And then it just goes on to act like I'm involved in it.
[02:48:56.159 --> 02:48:57.320]  Yeah, it's the same article I read.
[02:48:58.314 --> 02:49:01.916]  Mainstream media all write the same article, they coordinate, they get ready, and then they put it out.
[02:49:02.436 --> 02:49:05.137]  Just like they coordinated with Apple when they banned me last week, our app.
[02:49:05.777 --> 02:49:11.460]  Just like they coordinated, uh... The Twitter ban, that was confirmed.
[02:49:11.580 --> 02:49:15.621]  Hundreds and hundreds of publications all came out at 4.47, the exact article.
[02:49:15.981 --> 02:49:16.922]  They just put their name on it.
[02:49:18.162 --> 02:49:24.385]  So they can just get their big lie going, like, we're gonna lie, so let's all lie together to make it look more believable.
[02:49:26.670 --> 02:49:31.213]  I'm telling you, they're going to attack synagogues, churches, schools, and blame it on me.
[02:49:31.273 --> 02:49:31.713]  It's coming.
[02:49:35.075 --> 02:49:36.516]  So then they'll really come after me with violence.
[02:49:36.576 --> 02:49:36.976]  That's the plan.
[02:49:36.996 --> 02:49:40.398]  They're going to do the same thing to our wonderful president.
[02:49:40.618 --> 02:49:41.239]  But it's okay.
[02:49:41.839 --> 02:49:44.040]  We've got bad people in the country, bad globalists.
[02:49:44.861 --> 02:49:45.641]  We've got to be men again.
[02:49:45.661 --> 02:49:46.462]  We've got to stand up to them.
[02:49:46.482 --> 02:49:47.442]  We've got to go through some pain.
[02:49:48.003 --> 02:49:48.863]  And I'm very honored to do it.
[02:49:48.883 --> 02:49:50.004]  People say, wow, you're being attacked.
[02:49:50.044 --> 02:49:50.684]  How are you handling it?
[02:49:50.704 --> 02:49:51.765]  I'm like, I'm doing great.
[02:49:53.337 --> 02:49:56.761]  I just hope I'm strong enough to really give them one hell of a political fight.
[02:49:59.363 --> 02:50:00.785]  People are like, wow.
[02:50:00.845 --> 02:50:02.446]  Because, I mean, this is what you're supposed to do.
[02:50:03.007 --> 02:50:04.248]  I'm not rolling over to these crooks.
[02:50:05.669 --> 02:50:06.710]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:50:10.294 --> 02:50:11.956]  Let's go to Cole in Texas.
[02:50:11.996 --> 02:50:12.656]  Cole, you're on the air.
[02:50:12.676 --> 02:50:13.017]  Go ahead.
[02:50:13.037 --> 02:50:14.578]  Hello, Alex.
[02:50:15.099 --> 02:50:15.419]  Hey, brother.
[02:50:15.799 --> 02:50:16.220]  Hello, Alex.
[02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:17.261]  How are you doing, sir?
[02:50:18.171 --> 02:50:27.616]  I just want to start out by saying, the Minimal Infusion, AnthroPlex, Survivor Shield, and BrainForcer are like my favorite get-up-and-go combo.
[02:50:27.936 --> 02:50:29.297]  So, thank you for those.
[02:50:29.477 --> 02:50:30.517]  Thank you, brother.
[02:50:31.218 --> 02:50:39.281]  I wanted to talk about an article that I read in MIT Technology Review, and it's written by Chinese professor Yasheng Huang.
[02:50:40.502 --> 02:50:42.383]  It says, Can Big Data Tame Big Brother?
[02:50:43.371 --> 02:50:47.418]  And it's pretty interesting, the psychological judo it does.
[02:50:47.438 --> 02:50:51.104]  It says, China is a repressive society with or without big data.
[02:50:51.404 --> 02:50:56.032]  Technology has made the repression more precise, but that might be an improvement over indiscriminate repression.
[02:50:56.880 --> 02:51:05.909]  So they're trying to say that if your privacy goes away, and even though they're repressive, being more surveilled... That's saying it's scientific, it's more professional now.
[02:51:06.229 --> 02:51:14.297]  When we take your political dissonance organs for criticizing the government for being Buddhist or Christian, which is the real issue of crime, it's okay because at least we know you really did it.
[02:51:16.196 --> 02:51:22.218]  Yeah, it's just like the communists would make you sign a confession because they couldn't prove, or they didn't really care about the proof.
[02:51:22.438 --> 02:51:24.238]  That's right, they pull your fingernails out until you do it.
[02:51:24.638 --> 02:51:35.901]  And just like Twitter and Google never let you know when you're banned, when you're digitally executed, that's how the Russians and others would do it, is they take you out and march you around every day until the final day you get shot in the back of the head.
[02:51:36.662 --> 02:51:37.442]  Great points, Cole.
[02:51:37.482 --> 02:51:37.902]  Anything else?
[02:51:38.939 --> 02:51:42.201]  Yeah, I started reading the Gulag Archipelago.
[02:51:42.861 --> 02:51:47.164]  If people want to see the atrocities of communism taking power, it's not for the faint of heart.
[02:51:47.784 --> 02:51:53.688]  And also, this current technology, the MIT Technology Review, I mean, article after article, it's just like that.
[02:51:55.109 --> 02:51:59.552]  Like you say, it could be a college course alone and just in a couple of articles that are published there.
[02:52:00.812 --> 02:52:02.373]  Anyway, God bless you, Alex.
[02:52:02.774 --> 02:52:05.435]  I guess one more thing, there is an alternative to the Google
[02:52:08.545 --> 02:52:10.157]  Operating system for Android phones.
[02:52:10.439 --> 02:52:11.265]  It's called Lineage OS.
[02:52:12.490 --> 02:52:15.211]  It would be really cool if you could get Richard Stallman on again to talk about it.
[02:52:16.051 --> 02:52:26.554]  Sure, my issue is I should have access to the marketplace on the major platforms, and then we went to number one on both Apple and Google, and so now Apple's deleted it where you can't get it unless you already had it.
[02:52:26.574 --> 02:52:30.576]  Again, that's outrageous, and it's one thing if it had bugs and complaints and problems.
[02:52:30.876 --> 02:52:32.016]  It's got five stars!
[02:52:32.216 --> 02:52:33.196]  Perfect five stars!
[02:52:33.577 --> 02:52:34.657]  No one else even has it!
[02:52:34.697 --> 02:52:35.817]  We were number one!
[02:52:36.357 --> 02:52:37.398]  And they go, oh my god!
[02:52:38.158 --> 02:52:41.119]  At current download rates, we would have, actually the numbers last night,
[02:52:42.718 --> 02:52:45.179]  20 million subscribers in a year at current rates.
[02:52:45.499 --> 02:52:46.959]  They're not going to let us do that.
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:48.700]  God bless you, brother.
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:49.500]  I appreciate your call.
[02:52:50.881 --> 02:52:52.301]  Okay, who's up next here?
[02:52:54.002 --> 02:52:56.923]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Rhode Island.
[02:52:57.483 --> 02:52:58.263]  Michael, you're on the air.
[02:52:58.283 --> 02:52:58.843]  Thanks for holding.
[02:52:58.863 --> 02:53:01.544]  Can you hear me, buddy?
[02:53:01.984 --> 02:53:02.244]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:02.284 --> 02:53:04.145]  How are you doing today?
[02:53:04.205 --> 02:53:05.505]  I'm going to just get to it quick.
[02:53:05.525 --> 02:53:07.306]  Yeah, I actually work at Amazon.
[02:53:08.283 --> 02:53:08.904]  I don't think so.
[02:53:23.613 --> 02:53:24.053]  It's crazy, man.
[02:53:24.274 --> 02:53:27.757]  Well, it's about dominating you and totally squeezing whatever they can out of you.
[02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:32.541]  The more liberal a company... I mean, Apple has the worst slave factories on Earth.
[02:53:33.461 --> 02:53:34.362]  It's a religion.
[02:53:34.582 --> 02:53:35.183]  It's a big joke.
[02:53:35.203 --> 02:53:36.344]  They're giggling, they're laughing.
[02:53:36.664 --> 02:53:38.686]  Oh, I'm Tim Cook, I'm gay, everything's cool.
[02:53:39.046 --> 02:53:44.531]  But then China kills gays and throws them off buildings and murders them, but he doesn't have a problem with that.
[02:53:44.771 --> 02:53:45.571]  He's a monster.
[02:53:47.073 --> 02:53:48.154]  So same thing with Bezos.
[02:53:48.214 --> 02:53:49.535]  I mean, these guys are jokes.
[02:53:51.922 --> 02:54:04.972]  Yeah, I'm in a democratic state, Rhode Island, and you can see what Governor Raimondo, she actually tweeted out that she was banning guns in school, and like a day later there was a shooting outside the school and this kid died.
[02:54:05.012 --> 02:54:06.153]  I'm like, this lady's an idiot.
[02:54:06.193 --> 02:54:07.894]  We're definitely going to vote her out.
[02:54:07.914 --> 02:54:10.576]  We're going to have a red wave in Rhode Island for sure.
[02:54:11.737 --> 02:54:19.663]  What do you make of Amazon and the new patent where you sit in a giant cage on top of a huge robot, and you're in a cage running robot arms?
[02:54:21.650 --> 02:54:22.350]  You're nuts, man.
[02:54:22.410 --> 02:54:25.511]  I mean, that's in China, right?
[02:54:25.972 --> 02:54:26.852]  Or is that in America?
[02:54:26.872 --> 02:54:28.292]  They're bringing it to America.
[02:54:29.333 --> 02:54:30.133]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[02:54:30.153 --> 02:54:35.075]  You sit in a giant robot machine, and I think it says the robot's, what, 18 feet tall?
[02:54:35.255 --> 02:54:36.235]  I have to pull the article up.
[02:54:37.416 --> 02:54:40.277]  You ride around like Master Blaster on top of a giant robot.
[02:54:45.739 --> 02:54:46.759]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:54:48.752 --> 02:54:52.266]  Amazon's now delisting conservative books, playing games, manipulating them.
[02:54:53.354 --> 02:54:55.056]  Amazon's playing with us on there.
[02:54:55.076 --> 02:54:57.077]  People say, well, you hate Amazon, why are you there?
[02:54:57.117 --> 02:54:58.719]  Because they put counterfeits on there if I don't.
[02:54:59.059 --> 02:54:59.619]  Then undercut us.
[02:54:59.659 --> 02:55:04.824]  We have to be on Amazon to control our market so that our real products are there, not counterfeits.
[02:55:05.004 --> 02:55:07.286]  But we don't push, hey, buy the products from Amazon.
[02:55:07.626 --> 02:55:09.387]  And they're playing all sorts of games with us.
[02:55:10.088 --> 02:55:18.195]  And of course, after they stage the false flag, it'll be take his website down, arrest him, and then people will go, well, he's Alex Jones, let him get arrested, or let him get shut down, and then it'll be you.
[02:55:19.633 --> 02:55:20.673]  Let's take another call here.
[02:55:20.853 --> 02:55:21.994]  Who is up next?
[02:55:23.674 --> 02:55:28.315]  Let's go ahead and talk to Travis in Florida.
[02:55:29.395 --> 02:55:30.076]  Go ahead, Travis.
[02:55:31.956 --> 02:55:32.856]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:55:33.296 --> 02:55:36.157]  You know, I'm really, the country's in deep trouble, but at least we're fighting back.
[02:55:36.197 --> 02:55:40.038]  I'm getting persecuted hard, but you know, it's good to be number two under attack.
[02:55:40.058 --> 02:55:44.739]  I'm the president, I'm in good company, and so I, my bones feel good.
[02:55:44.899 --> 02:55:46.180]  I feel close to my ancestors.
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:47.820]  I feel like I'm delivering.
[02:55:48.789 --> 02:55:51.030]  You're definitely right there with us at the Patriots, Alex.
[02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:52.250]  I just want to bring up a couple quick points.
[02:55:52.310 --> 02:55:53.731]  I know you've got a lot to get to.
[02:55:53.751 --> 02:55:54.851]  You're absolutely right with the censorship.
[02:55:54.911 --> 02:55:56.412]  I mean, you can go to Google and see for yourself.
[02:55:56.432 --> 02:55:58.013]  You type in a news article you want to find.
[02:55:58.413 --> 02:56:00.114]  Good luck trying to find an Alex Jones article.
[02:56:00.134 --> 02:56:01.474]  Good luck trying to find Drug Report.
[02:56:01.494 --> 02:56:04.255]  Good luck trying to find Breitbart.
[02:56:04.295 --> 02:56:09.417]  And we used to be, until two years ago, number one, because whatever's most popular, they broke their algorithm.
[02:56:09.617 --> 02:56:10.618]  It's all censored now.
[02:56:10.658 --> 02:56:10.818]  Yeah.
[02:56:11.849 --> 02:56:31.814]  Absolutely, and then the last point I want to make is, as far as my friends go, I'm trying to wake them up to all this, because some of them, yeah, they're Republican, they get it, but, you know, you mentioned Alex Jones, they're like, oh, he's the one that's the conspiracy, he's the crazy conspiracy theory, and that just goes to tell you that the strawman demonization that they put out for you just gets to everyone's head, and they believe everything they hear from these mainstream media.
[02:56:31.834 --> 02:56:34.235]  And that's why if somebody actually hears, they know it's bull.
[02:56:34.955 --> 02:56:40.440]  But they inoculate them with poison, so they go, oh, he's the one that says there's slaves on Mars.
[02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:40.861]  Never said it.
[02:56:41.141 --> 02:56:42.362]  He's the one attacking Sandy Hook kids.
[02:56:42.382 --> 02:56:42.782]  Never said it.
[02:56:43.043 --> 02:56:44.103]  He's the one that docks their houses.
[02:56:44.124 --> 02:56:44.544]  Never said it.
[02:56:44.844 --> 02:56:48.728]  And it's the media lying, lying, lying, doing the abusive stuff in my name.
[02:56:48.748 --> 02:56:51.330]  And then exactly, then they're like, just stick a pencil in his neck.
[02:56:51.650 --> 02:56:54.053]  And then they don't get they're already being censored too.
[02:56:54.913 --> 02:56:56.295]  But they won't get banned for saying that.
[02:56:56.335 --> 02:56:57.176]  No, no, no, no.
[02:56:57.216 --> 02:56:57.596]  They're fine.
[02:56:57.636 --> 02:56:58.617]  That's not violence.
[02:56:59.633 --> 02:57:01.293]  And then last thing, Alex, I guess it is true.
[02:57:01.333 --> 02:57:02.974]  Truth is treason in the empire of lies.
[02:57:03.354 --> 02:57:04.394]  I want to thank you personally.
[02:57:04.414 --> 02:57:05.754]  I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
[02:57:06.255 --> 02:57:08.175]  Anyone who knows, it's like a hypothyroidism condition.
[02:57:08.615 --> 02:57:11.156]  I currently, I mean, the products, I can just name them off real quick.
[02:57:11.196 --> 02:57:18.837]  Brain Force, X2, Selenium, the Micro's DX, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Prostacard, the coffee, the Chaga Mushroom Blend, Super Male Vitality, Alpha Male.
[02:57:19.037 --> 02:57:21.118]  Let me tell you, it's given me my life back.
[02:57:21.358 --> 02:57:24.078]  I was just taking the thyroid medicine alone is just not enough.
[02:57:24.378 --> 02:57:26.879]  Just having these products has made my life just back to normal.
[02:57:27.199 --> 02:57:28.079]  I'm working harder.
[02:57:28.379 --> 02:57:29.200]  I'm smarter.
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:31.380]  I feel like I'm, I'm just, it's unbelievable.
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:32.320]  Your products are amazing.
[02:57:32.841 --> 02:57:36.722]  They are the highest quality you're going to get out there and that's why people love them.
[02:57:36.742 --> 02:57:37.642]  So thank you for the support.
[02:57:38.022 --> 02:57:38.482]  God bless you.
[02:57:38.502 --> 02:57:39.483]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:57:39.743 --> 02:57:40.363]  Take care, Travis.
[02:57:40.723 --> 02:57:43.044]  And yeah, and X2 and the iodine stuff is very serious.
[02:57:43.104 --> 02:57:48.365]  So consult your physicians always in case you have any issues with what this can do because it's very powerful.
[02:57:48.425 --> 02:57:49.285]  This is the real deal.
[02:57:49.585 --> 02:57:50.206]  All right, fourth hour.
[02:57:50.246 --> 02:57:51.146]  Your call is Gerald Celente.
[02:57:51.166 --> 02:57:51.486]  Straight ahead.
[02:57:52.344 --> 02:57:57.388]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[02:57:57.508 --> 02:58:05.815]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver, that is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[02:58:05.875 --> 02:58:14.621]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first-aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second-degree burns, skin irritations.
[02:58:14.822 --> 02:58:17.063]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[02:58:17.183 --> 02:58:19.165]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[02:58:19.365 --> 02:58:20.426]  It's just incredible.
[02:58:20.506 --> 02:58:22.107]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[02:58:22.187 --> 02:58:23.367]  This is next level.
[02:58:23.427 --> 02:58:24.968]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[02:58:25.508 --> 02:58:29.649]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[02:58:30.009 --> 02:58:34.411]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[02:58:34.531 --> 02:58:37.972]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[02:58:37.992 --> 02:58:39.413]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[02:58:39.573 --> 02:58:42.394]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[02:58:42.754 --> 02:58:46.437]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[02:58:47.057 --> 02:58:51.420]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world and turned out their listeners.
[02:58:51.700 --> 02:58:56.563]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-533-139.
[02:58:57.144 --> 02:59:03.568]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[02:59:04.108 --> 02:59:06.549]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using.
[02:59:06.829 --> 02:59:08.369]  The military, hospitals, you name it.
[02:59:08.730 --> 02:59:09.230]  This is it.
[02:59:09.490 --> 02:59:11.911]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[02:59:12.011 --> 02:59:13.711]  This stuff is thermonuclear.
[02:59:13.891 --> 02:59:14.452]  Nanotech.
[02:59:14.632 --> 02:59:18.473]  Super small particles which, going electromagnetically, just goes right to the heart of something.
[02:59:20.107 --> 02:59:35.253]  Super Silver wound dressing gel contains the powerful Silver Sol technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver market as the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind.
[02:59:35.373 --> 02:59:41.096]  This gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping
[02:59:41.476 --> 02:59:45.439]  Speed up the healing process, and that's the way I like it!
[02:59:45.519 --> 02:59:55.948]  Grab a bottle of Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel right now, and in fullwarslife.com.
[02:59:56.088 --> 02:59:59.731]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:59:59.752 --> 02:59:59.731]  1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[03:00:15.555 --> 03:00:18.178]  Welcome back!
[03:00:18.218 --> 03:00:20.100]  Worldwide broadcast, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[03:00:31.550 --> 03:00:37.232]  We're talking to callers right now, and I see one that sounds like they kind of disagree, so let me put them at the head of the line here.
[03:00:37.692 --> 03:00:40.033]  Charles Salente's coming up, and I'm going to try to jam some more of your calls in.
[03:00:40.733 --> 03:00:43.895]  He says, Alex Jones, it's 99% truth, 1% dangerous.
[03:00:43.955 --> 03:00:48.156]  Well, gosh, I'd like to be 99% truth, maybe like 95% truth.
[03:00:48.196 --> 03:00:48.896]  I get stuff wrong.
[03:00:49.617 --> 03:00:51.697]  But in the general main, I think I'm accurate.
[03:00:51.718 --> 03:00:53.258]  But elaborate on that.
[03:00:53.318 --> 03:00:55.359]  What's the truth, and what's the danger there, Chris?
[03:00:57.134 --> 03:01:07.258]  Alex, first I want to say I love you because I'm simpatico and your music is exactly, everything you do resonates with me.
[03:01:07.678 --> 03:01:09.278]  Well, here's what I want to say.
[03:01:09.298 --> 03:01:17.881]  If you were a perfect spy, you would be 99% what I love and then 1% deadly.
[03:01:18.061 --> 03:01:21.382]  And what I'm very afraid of is that you're the 1% because
[03:01:23.462 --> 03:01:25.644]  What's the most important thing coming up?
[03:01:25.904 --> 03:01:26.905]  It's the election.
[03:01:27.345 --> 03:01:37.814]  And what's the most important thing to do with the election is it's all controlled by computers, which they've told us about, and you're not advocating paper ballots.
[03:01:38.434 --> 03:01:39.896]  Go ahead.
[03:01:40.236 --> 03:01:48.303]  I have probably done 400, 500 shows over the years calling for election integrity, paper ballots, going back to that.
[03:01:49.105 --> 03:01:54.469]  There's this phenomenon where if you don't hear somebody talking about what you want when you tune in, they're not talking about it.
[03:01:54.489 --> 03:01:57.090]  I mean, if I'm an operative, I don't know it.
[03:01:58.071 --> 03:02:02.574]  You know, I see all this crazy stuff, this cottage industry, this guy's an operative, that guy's an operative.
[03:02:03.674 --> 03:02:07.337]  The fruit of my tree is getting the country back and freedom and globalism in trouble.
[03:02:08.766 --> 03:02:09.927]  And a pro-human future.
[03:02:10.947 --> 03:02:15.929]  I saw some guy the other day on the internet going, Alex Jones is going to go to prison for talking bad about Q or something.
[03:02:15.950 --> 03:02:17.290]  I only watched a few minutes of it.
[03:02:17.310 --> 03:02:18.031]  It was so sickening.
[03:02:18.051 --> 03:02:22.413]  And he goes, he's the poison fruit of the tree.
[03:02:23.173 --> 03:02:25.014]  And the guy's like, I've been listening to him for 15 years.
[03:02:25.054 --> 03:02:26.334]  He woke me up and brought me to Trump.
[03:02:26.555 --> 03:02:28.315]  But now he's been an agent all along.
[03:02:28.616 --> 03:02:29.316]  Horseman-er!
[03:02:29.596 --> 03:02:35.419]  How is it I woke you up and got you awake, and then now I'm this bad guy because some anonymous person said so?
[03:02:36.753 --> 03:02:38.253]  I mean, Mueller's bad.
[03:02:38.474 --> 03:02:39.354]  Trump hates him.
[03:02:39.414 --> 03:02:40.294]  I've talked to Trump.
[03:02:40.994 --> 03:02:44.595]  It's poppycock what you hear from that Q person.
[03:02:45.996 --> 03:02:48.537]  Whoever this Q group is said some good things up front.
[03:02:49.437 --> 03:02:50.317]  And I want to believe it.
[03:02:50.577 --> 03:02:52.158]  And I want to believe that all this stuff's great.
[03:02:52.178 --> 03:02:53.618]  But no, Sessions is a coward!
[03:02:54.959 --> 03:02:55.819]  Mueller's horrible!
[03:02:56.701 --> 03:02:57.922]  They're not good guys.
[03:02:58.202 --> 03:03:02.225]  And then the whole Cuban bit's so whacked out, now it's, Jones will sue me to get Beau.
[03:03:02.245 --> 03:03:03.426]  Yeah, he's a problem.
[03:03:03.847 --> 03:03:04.667]  Not Hillary Clinton.
[03:03:06.088 --> 03:03:08.931]  So you're like, you're not talking about paper ballots.
[03:03:09.811 --> 03:03:11.252]  And I think it's a cheap shot, Chris.
[03:03:11.292 --> 03:03:12.593]  I don't mind people disagreeing with me.
[03:03:13.974 --> 03:03:20.259]  But I have done so many, the Collier brothers before they died, they have Harris probably a hundred times.
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:24.663]  I mean, I have beat this, David Knight beats this into the ground.
[03:03:26.192 --> 03:03:29.333]  I don't know how many... Yes, we have major election fraud.
[03:03:29.453 --> 03:03:31.534]  Yes, we have people voting in the name of dead people.
[03:03:31.994 --> 03:03:41.078]  Yes, we've got... We have articles all over InfoWars about 12-year-old girl, 11-year-old girl hacks in to one of the voting machines in, what, 30 seconds last week?
[03:03:41.498 --> 03:03:42.799]  So, you must have missed that show.
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:48.321]  No, I followed all this stuff.
[03:03:49.641 --> 03:03:52.983]  Okay, so, if I was the ultimate spy, well...
[03:03:53.769 --> 03:03:56.510]  I'll say this, if I am a spy, I don't know it.
[03:03:56.870 --> 03:04:00.011]  I mean, hell, the world's so weird, I might be a robot or something.
[03:04:01.632 --> 03:04:11.295]  See, I want to tell you before I sign off that I love Joyce Riley, and I love you just as much as you, and I hope you're not a spy.
[03:04:11.315 --> 03:04:12.155]  Thank you.
[03:04:12.215 --> 03:04:12.575]  Okay.
[03:04:13.195 --> 03:04:13.755]  Well, there you go.
[03:04:16.147 --> 03:04:18.509]  It's kind of a weird little thing I see and I hear out there.
[03:04:18.990 --> 03:04:35.386]  Instead of doing anything or getting involved, there's this thing about telling the most prominent, hardworking people how they're in the arena and how they could have done a better job, and then they just repeat the same thing, like, all the real researchers know Jones works for the Mossad.
[03:04:36.377 --> 03:04:38.077]  As long as I'm not anti-Israel.
[03:04:38.397 --> 03:04:40.118]  Also, I don't like a lot of stuff Israel does.
[03:04:40.638 --> 03:04:41.298]  It's crazy.
[03:04:41.658 --> 03:04:45.819]  They're like, oh, he's telling you China's the problem because he works for Israel.
[03:04:46.239 --> 03:04:47.960]  Israel sold us out to China, too.
[03:04:50.160 --> 03:04:55.921]  It's just mental illness, but it's the way little people who don't want to be big people put down big men and then feel good.
[03:04:56.001 --> 03:04:57.242]  Oh, that Jones, he's a fraud.
[03:04:57.502 --> 03:04:58.162]  Me, I'm good.
[03:04:58.542 --> 03:04:59.042]  Everything's fine.
[03:04:59.082 --> 03:04:59.942]  And Mueller's good, too.
[03:05:00.162 --> 03:05:00.762]  You said so.
[03:05:05.911 --> 03:05:11.876]  So if you want to see this mission continue, and if you understand they want to shut us down for a reason, then you need to financially support us.
[03:05:12.317 --> 03:05:13.197]  And I want to thank you all.
[03:05:13.277 --> 03:05:14.258]  I'm not shaming anybody.
[03:05:14.278 --> 03:05:16.040]  I'm thanking you for so far supporting us.
[03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:22.365]  But you cannot put money into something that is more aggressive against tyranny and satanist and anti-human filth.
[03:05:22.646 --> 03:05:24.767]  And we've got products that help you.
[03:05:24.787 --> 03:05:27.750]  I mean, even mainstream media admits they have to, that fish roe is the best thing out there.
[03:05:27.950 --> 03:05:29.151]  But you want the pure fish oil.
[03:05:29.251 --> 03:05:30.633]  You want the mercury removed.
[03:05:30.773 --> 03:05:33.035]  We have the best, strongest, cleanest you're gonna get anywhere.
[03:05:33.195 --> 03:05:33.936]  The best krill oil.
[03:05:34.016 --> 03:05:36.639]  The best wild harvested from the fjords of the North Atlantic.
[03:05:36.699 --> 03:05:40.162]  Salmon and the best concentrated in little pills for the kids.
[03:05:40.622 --> 03:05:41.103]  The honor roll.
[03:05:41.123 --> 03:05:41.743]  Three different types.
[03:05:41.824 --> 03:05:42.704]  You cannot do better.
[03:05:42.764 --> 03:05:43.345]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:05:43.605 --> 03:05:44.166]  Help the brain.
[03:05:44.206 --> 03:05:44.646]  Help the body.
[03:05:44.686 --> 03:05:45.107]  Help the heart.
[03:05:45.147 --> 03:05:45.727]  Help the InfoWare.
[03:05:45.747 --> 03:05:46.408]  Win, win, win, win, win.
[03:05:46.608 --> 03:05:49.929]  And then we've got Ultimate Tumor Formula about to sell out bodies at 50% off.
[03:05:50.029 --> 03:05:51.930]  Bone broth, I'm about to cut that special this week.
[03:05:52.050 --> 03:05:53.830]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:05:53.930 --> 03:05:59.632]  I really appreciate you standing with us, but we need massive capital infusions so I can energize to take on Soros and Hillary.
[03:05:59.952 --> 03:06:00.372]  I need it!
[03:06:04.474 --> 03:06:07.275]  The front lines of the information war.
[03:06:07.595 --> 03:06:09.095]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:09.435 --> 03:06:09.875]  Watch me!
[03:06:09.895 --> 03:06:10.395]  Watch me!
[03:06:11.296 --> 03:06:11.836]  Watch me!
[03:06:13.027 --> 03:06:16.009]  All right, Gerald Salente is coming up here in about five minutes.
[03:06:16.029 --> 03:06:17.630]  The top trends researcher.
[03:06:17.930 --> 03:06:18.911]  Trendsresearch.com.
[03:06:18.951 --> 03:06:20.212]  Can't wait to hear what he has to say.
[03:06:20.232 --> 03:06:21.993]  And I've been meaning to get a hold of him.
[03:06:22.013 --> 03:06:22.853]  He's been trying to get a hold of me.
[03:06:22.873 --> 03:06:25.395]  He had some advice on how to counter all these disinformation attacks.
[03:06:26.356 --> 03:06:34.161]  And so I want to get his idea on this obvious deplatforming plan to take me down first and then take everybody else down, which has now begun, and what he thinks President Trump should do.
[03:06:35.261 --> 03:06:38.744]  Paul Watson said the article would be out in the next few hours, but I've checked InfoWars.com.
[03:06:38.784 --> 03:06:40.005]  Could you guys check again?
[03:06:40.865 --> 03:06:46.926]  He's going to do one about his high-level sources say the executive order is coming this week from Trump.
[03:06:47.246 --> 03:06:56.028]  I was told that two weeks ago, but he's so sabotaged, and they won't execute what he says, that that's why it's taking longer.
[03:06:57.148 --> 03:06:58.808]  I mean, we're in a crisis, folks.
[03:06:58.828 --> 03:06:59.888]  This is so crazy.
[03:06:59.908 --> 03:07:02.069]  I don't have words to describe this.
[03:07:05.229 --> 03:07:08.750]  Google won't help the military in the US, but it's helping China with AI.
[03:07:11.377 --> 03:07:13.218]  They are all in concert banning me.
[03:07:14.599 --> 03:07:18.122]  They're now taking our app that had over 2 million downloads in 5 weeks down.
[03:07:18.222 --> 03:07:18.422]  Why?
[03:07:18.482 --> 03:07:25.247]  Because it was going to have, at that growth rate, over 20 million downloads in the next year.
[03:07:26.528 --> 03:07:27.449]  Even if the rates slowed.
[03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:29.851]  They can't have us being number one!
[03:07:31.592 --> 03:07:32.713]  And I've done the analysis.
[03:07:32.733 --> 03:07:33.774]  They're not going to stop there.
[03:07:33.814 --> 03:07:36.856]  They've now got articles everywhere saying, kill me if I'm seen in public.
[03:07:36.916 --> 03:07:37.737]  Newsday, you name it.
[03:07:38.998 --> 03:07:40.459]  Just like they say, kill the president everywhere.
[03:07:41.519 --> 03:07:46.702]  Let's talk about Syria and Trump.
[03:07:47.423 --> 03:07:54.748]  One area I'm mad at Trump about is Syria, but I understand that Iran is breaking their deal that they would leave after ISIS and Al Qaeda was beaten.
[03:07:54.768 --> 03:08:01.412]  It is a big civilian population and you don't want to see them go into a lib that's got over a million people in it.
[03:08:02.133 --> 03:08:02.633]  But the U.S.
[03:08:02.673 --> 03:08:04.554]  is already bombing and it's not even in our news.
[03:08:04.614 --> 03:08:05.175]  Then you have
[03:08:07.196 --> 03:08:09.378]  The Pentagon's saying, oh, we think he's using chlorine gas.
[03:08:09.418 --> 03:08:11.379]  Why would Assad cross that red line and do that?
[03:08:12.060 --> 03:08:17.403]  So I got mad at Trump last time because it was admittedly a chemical attack in April of this year that didn't even happen.
[03:08:17.864 --> 03:08:18.644]  Later that was confirmed.
[03:08:19.045 --> 03:08:21.186]  So launching attacks based on fake attacks.
[03:08:21.406 --> 03:08:30.773]  If Trump did an Oval Office address and said, we made a deal five years ago that they'd pull out, the Pentagon blocked Obama doing all this, now ISIS and Iran are supposed to get out.
[03:08:30.813 --> 03:08:31.234]  They're not.
[03:08:31.494 --> 03:08:32.835]  We're not going to let them hurt the civilians.
[03:08:32.855 --> 03:08:33.996]  We're going to bomb the Iranians.
[03:08:34.756 --> 03:08:37.438]  I wouldn't agree with it, but I wouldn't flip out.
[03:08:39.219 --> 03:08:40.460]  Because Trump knows what's going on.
[03:08:41.041 --> 03:08:42.642]  And the generals are trying to drag him into a water war.
[03:08:42.662 --> 03:08:43.863]  We'll get Gerald's take on that as well.
[03:08:43.883 --> 03:08:45.624]  But Lee and Mass, go ahead and make your point.
[03:08:46.685 --> 03:08:49.467]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:08:49.507 --> 03:08:51.248]  First off, your products are awesome.
[03:08:51.408 --> 03:08:54.050]  I love you and hang strong.
[03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:58.894]  You know, when your enemies are coming at you full gear like they are, you're doing something right.
[03:08:59.094 --> 03:08:59.354]  Thank you.
[03:09:00.211 --> 03:09:01.793]  You really are.
[03:09:02.313 --> 03:09:22.932]  Yeah, with Syria, you know, I think what's going on is, you know, you've got Congress doing all their shuffling and our media is not getting out to the people that, you know, we've got 200 soldiers in Idlib with the UK and Russia offered to get them out of there and they refused it because the Brits
[03:09:23.713 --> 03:09:25.354]  By the way, Russia has been warning of this for months.
[03:09:40.546 --> 03:09:46.427]  They've caught the rebels staging two chemical attacks and staging one that didn't happen in mid-April of this year, so you're absolutely right.
[03:09:47.087 --> 03:09:53.328]  And the Russians have been bending over backwards, saying they'll completely pull out, and they've already pulled most forces out.
[03:09:53.908 --> 03:09:56.129]  So, what do you think's behind this?
[03:09:57.709 --> 03:09:58.389]  The pipeline.
[03:09:59.069 --> 03:10:06.310]  I really think that, you know, they wanted to bring it up through Syria, but when Russia got involved, you know, they stopped it.
[03:10:06.390 --> 03:10:09.171]  We've been going at them for years to try to get that through.
[03:10:10.127 --> 03:10:17.312]  And on Israel Live today, they were saying that they may even try to pipe it over through Israel so that we still have control of it.
[03:10:17.812 --> 03:10:22.755]  But we've got ISIS and al Qaeda, and we're right there with them in Idlib.
[03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:34.329]  No, that's right, and the argument is, if that gets pushed out, that will be the last Saudi Arabian contingent, and then Saudi Arabia will get mad if Iran is allowed to take control.
[03:10:34.689 --> 03:10:38.773]  So Iran is supposed to pull back as well, and of course they're not, they're amassing more troops.
[03:10:38.793 --> 03:10:45.739]  So I see the predicament trumps in, but there were white phosphorus attacks, Reuters reported it too on Sunday, no coverage of that.
[03:10:45.879 --> 03:10:47.140]  I thought I was watching Fox this morning.
[03:10:47.580 --> 03:10:50.343]  They had to admit that the rebels had been caught staging stuff before.
[03:10:50.663 --> 03:10:51.884]  So we've come that far.
[03:10:52.164 --> 03:10:53.385]  We're on Fox News.
[03:10:53.685 --> 03:10:58.709]  They're talking about false flags with generals on Fox News while I was sitting there on the elliptical this morning.
[03:10:59.758 --> 03:11:00.258]  God bless you.
[03:11:00.759 --> 03:11:01.199]  Thank you, Lee.
[03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:02.680]  Sorry to all the other callers.
[03:11:02.700 --> 03:11:03.521]  I got to as many as I could.
[03:11:03.561 --> 03:11:04.782]  I apologize to everybody else.
[03:11:05.702 --> 03:11:07.083]  We can write down your name and info.
[03:11:07.324 --> 03:11:08.144]  Tomorrow we take calls.
[03:11:08.164 --> 03:11:10.966]  If you call in, tell us you were on hold yesterday, you'll go to the front of the line.
[03:11:11.126 --> 03:11:12.588]  We'll be taking a lot more calls here on the show.
[03:11:13.108 --> 03:11:15.810]  They don't want us communicating with each other and calls are a precious part of that.
[03:11:16.130 --> 03:11:20.934]  Gerald Cilente, I want to get into Iran and Iraq and Syria with you briefly.
[03:11:21.214 --> 03:11:23.295]  Then I want to get your expert take and then let you take over.
[03:11:23.315 --> 03:11:23.676]  I don't want to
[03:11:24.236 --> 03:11:27.078]  Steal your thunder, that's why you're here, on what you think I should do.
[03:11:27.098 --> 03:11:30.541]  Because they're everywhere saying that I'm going to cause violence with no proof.
[03:11:31.121 --> 03:11:34.063]  Clearly, they're saying Trump's going to cause violence with no proof against the media.
[03:11:34.444 --> 03:11:38.747]  I think they're preparing a false flag here ahead of the midterms with 57 days left.
[03:11:40.428 --> 03:11:46.112]  It's a definite censorship against anyone against the establishment.
[03:11:46.857 --> 03:11:49.439]  It's going on all over the world except here.
[03:11:49.479 --> 03:11:52.742]  You have anti-establishment movements going on in Italy.
[03:11:52.762 --> 03:11:58.307]  You just saw what happened in Sweden, in Germany, in Spain.
[03:11:59.047 --> 03:12:02.350]  So what they're doing is they're silencing people like you.
[03:12:02.370 --> 03:12:08.896]  And we're doing a whole story actually in the Trends Journal that will be out later this week.
[03:12:09.416 --> 03:12:12.599]  It's called Media Censorship Trend to Escalate.
[03:12:13.982 --> 03:12:20.066]  Long before InfoWars, Alex Jones was banned by Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Spotify, etc.
[03:12:20.606 --> 03:12:28.651]  And Apple removed his app because he had violated the company's rules against objectionable content.
[03:12:29.351 --> 03:12:40.718]  America, as with many nations, silenced voices that challenge establishment propaganda, favoring media that plugs special business interests,
[03:12:41.536 --> 03:12:43.797]  And it's political and their political agendas.
[03:12:44.378 --> 03:12:45.458]  That's what's going on.
[03:12:46.399 --> 03:12:48.180]  It goes back to Trump's election.
[03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:58.806]  The day he's elected, the headline news in USA Today, new president enters office with something like 74 lawsuits.
[03:12:59.366 --> 03:13:00.907]  Not that we had a new president.
[03:13:01.727 --> 03:13:02.848]  It's been an anti
[03:13:03.792 --> 03:13:08.816]  Anybody going against the establishment is being taken out by the establishment.
[03:13:09.296 --> 03:13:20.785]  And you're the prime example, because you're the leader of the anti-establishment movement, as far as people that view your shows, follow you on your websites.
[03:13:21.326 --> 03:13:27.190]  So you are the voice of the anti- against the establishment, and they want no part of it.
[03:13:30.399 --> 03:13:35.621]  It's exponentially accelerating now with calls for me to be killed in mainstream media.
[03:13:35.821 --> 03:13:37.822]  They want me to be stabbed in the neck with pencils, murdered.
[03:13:38.142 --> 03:13:39.003]  They want Trump murdered.
[03:13:39.263 --> 03:13:42.464]  They're sticking stickers on his back saying Mr. Dumbass.
[03:13:42.724 --> 03:13:46.266]  They're putting signs up over his door to psy-op him saying crazy town.
[03:13:47.086 --> 03:13:53.812]  I mean, this is a civil war in this country by people that are for multinational globalist interests, and people that are patriots.
[03:13:54.072 --> 03:13:56.894]  I gotta say, Trump's not perfect, but you know a man by his enemies.
[03:13:57.234 --> 03:13:58.755]  He is really something else.
[03:13:58.855 --> 03:14:02.919]  I mean, it's just a miracle he got in, and they are just so angry.
[03:14:04.140 --> 03:14:07.022]  Yeah, well, again, it's not a miracle that he got in.
[03:14:07.082 --> 03:14:09.204]  And again, as you well know, we forecast it.
[03:14:09.584 --> 03:14:12.246]  The people are disgusted with the establishment.
[03:14:13.129 --> 03:14:14.709]  And that's what's really happened.
[03:14:15.530 --> 03:14:17.030]  Why did Hillary Clinton lose?
[03:14:17.070 --> 03:14:18.630]  Because people couldn't stand her.
[03:14:19.250 --> 03:14:20.611]  And the Clintons.
[03:14:20.991 --> 03:14:22.171]  And the establishment.
[03:14:22.451 --> 03:14:36.974]  And now you got Obama going out there campaigning, and people are forgetting how the, uh, when he was in office, how both houses and governorships went Republican because people couldn't stand him.
[03:14:37.654 --> 03:14:40.715]  So what I'm saying, Alex, and I'm saying to you is,
[03:14:41.462 --> 03:14:44.563]  Stay on to the populist message.
[03:14:45.143 --> 03:14:48.144]  The people are against the establishment.
[03:14:48.705 --> 03:14:51.306]  They've screwed them in every way possible.
[03:14:51.866 --> 03:14:53.046]  Look at the earnings.
[03:14:53.486 --> 03:14:55.947]  Look how people have to struggle to make a living.
[03:14:56.428 --> 03:14:58.048]  Look at the endless wars.
[03:14:58.548 --> 03:15:05.531]  Look at the people like, you know, that never have a job in their lives and now are
[03:15:05.931 --> 03:15:10.115]  Congressmen and Senators for eternity.
[03:15:10.236 --> 03:15:10.456]  I agree.
[03:15:10.476 --> 03:15:11.497]  Let me ask you this question.
[03:15:11.657 --> 03:15:16.342]  What do you think is going to happen if the red wave is strong and the Democrats lose again?
[03:15:16.362 --> 03:15:17.884]  Are they going to get even crazier?
[03:15:17.904 --> 03:15:20.346]  Are they going to finally stop and let us have prosperity?
[03:15:20.386 --> 03:15:21.888]  Because they're just in crazed mode.
[03:15:22.873 --> 03:15:24.555]  No, they're going to go crazier.
[03:15:24.595 --> 03:15:33.645]  That's why they've gone crazy with this anti-Russian sentiment, blaming the Russians for Hillary Clinton losing the election without one fact.
[03:15:34.105 --> 03:15:39.031]  So what I'm saying to you is, you know, just keep staying true to yourself and keep
[03:15:39.791 --> 03:15:42.093]  Selling the populist message.
[03:15:42.513 --> 03:15:43.834]  It's not about Trump.
[03:15:43.914 --> 03:15:45.335]  It's not about anyone.
[03:15:45.716 --> 03:15:54.922]  It's about the people against the dictatorship, the fascist state of America that's been taken over by the corporations.
[03:15:55.302 --> 03:15:59.145]  And you don't need any more proof than too big to fail.
[03:15:59.165 --> 03:15:59.706]  That's right.
[03:15:59.726 --> 03:16:00.906]  We'll be back with Gerald Cilente.
[03:16:00.926 --> 03:16:01.307]  Straight ahead.
[03:16:02.404 --> 03:16:06.225]  Alex Jones was quite the spectacle today.
[03:16:06.265 --> 03:16:14.788]  The most relevant part of this so far has been an interaction that Marco Rubio had while talking to reporters with Alex Jones.
[03:16:15.028 --> 03:16:20.050]  You know, look, part of this I think you could argue and say, why are you guys giving them any attention for this nonsense?
[03:16:20.090 --> 03:16:22.451]  But I think there's a point to this that's important.
[03:16:22.491 --> 03:16:23.511]  Here is this sort of spectacle.
[03:16:23.531 --> 03:16:28.273]  Marco Rubio is doing an interview and Alex Jones bumbles up to him.
[03:16:28.373 --> 03:16:34.336]  Our interview was cut short because he was confronted by Alex Jones of InfoWars right here in the hallway.
[03:16:34.356 --> 03:16:40.960]  I think Facebook now, I think it's important for them not to comply with any efforts to sort of go after freedom of expression.
[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:43.321]  What about the Democrats purging conservatives?
[03:16:43.341 --> 03:16:43.902]  She's not answering.
[03:16:44.862 --> 03:16:47.043]  Just that the Republicans are acting like it isn't happening.
[03:16:47.063 --> 03:16:47.823]  Thank God Trump is.
[03:16:48.564 --> 03:16:49.064]  That's weird.
[03:16:49.084 --> 03:16:50.264]  Oh yeah, it's really weird.
[03:16:50.284 --> 03:16:51.405]  There's no purge of conservatives.
[03:16:51.465 --> 03:16:52.545]  There's no shadowbanning.
[03:16:52.986 --> 03:16:55.367]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[03:16:55.847 --> 03:16:58.728]  Are you concerned about bias in social media?
[03:16:58.868 --> 03:17:01.409]  Well, I think the bigger bias is against freedom of expression.
[03:17:01.609 --> 03:17:07.032]  Everybody should be... There's a... Look, I support going after... Is that a heckler?
[03:17:07.072 --> 03:17:07.852]  Is that a pressagaggle?
[03:17:08.012 --> 03:17:08.652]  Look at this guy.
[03:17:08.692 --> 03:17:10.153]  He's saying that I don't exist.
[03:17:10.213 --> 03:17:12.094]  I just don't know who you are, man.
[03:17:12.134 --> 03:17:13.335]  I don't read through your website.
[03:17:13.375 --> 03:17:13.675]  Sure.
[03:17:13.755 --> 03:17:15.816]  And they demonize me in these fair hearings.
[03:17:16.016 --> 03:17:16.856]  And then he plays dumb.
[03:17:16.956 --> 03:17:19.597]  Infowars.com, you know what it is.
[03:17:19.637 --> 03:17:20.118]  Google.
[03:17:20.138 --> 03:17:20.858]  That's Facebook.
[03:17:20.878 --> 03:17:22.419]  That's why you're getting elected.
[03:17:22.439 --> 03:17:25.640]  They need to be regulated.
[03:17:26.181 --> 03:17:28.702]  Like, like, do they need to be regulated?
[03:17:28.842 --> 03:17:29.462]  Who are you?
[03:17:29.622 --> 03:17:30.062]  Yeah, sure.
[03:17:30.182 --> 03:17:31.923]  I swear to God, I don't know who you are, man.
[03:17:33.604 --> 03:17:34.685]  InfoWars.
[03:17:34.705 --> 03:17:36.587]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[03:17:36.627 --> 03:17:37.848]  He's playing this joke over here.
[03:17:37.868 --> 03:17:40.090]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[03:17:40.110 --> 03:17:41.591]  Here's a question.
[03:17:41.631 --> 03:17:42.612]  Don't touch me again.
[03:17:42.692 --> 03:17:44.394]  I'm asking you not to touch me.
[03:17:44.474 --> 03:17:45.935]  I know, but I don't want to be touched.
[03:17:45.975 --> 03:17:47.016]  I don't know who you are.
[03:17:47.096 --> 03:17:48.477]  I'm going to get arrested, man.
[03:17:48.557 --> 03:17:49.318]  I'm going to get arrested.
[03:17:49.378 --> 03:17:50.779]  I'll take care of myself.
[03:17:51.060 --> 03:17:51.700]  He'll beat me up.
[03:17:51.740 --> 03:17:52.561]  I didn't say that.
[03:17:52.581 --> 03:17:53.662]  I know I am, but he's so mad.
[03:17:54.082 --> 03:17:55.804]  You're not going to silence me.
[03:17:55.824 --> 03:17:56.925]  You're not going to silence America.
[03:17:56.965 --> 03:17:59.487]  But there are people... You are literally like a little gangster thug.
[03:17:59.527 --> 03:18:02.990]  There are people in this country... Rubio just threatened to physically take care of me.
[03:18:03.010 --> 03:18:06.734]  There are people who feel that they're being... They are being silenced.
[03:18:06.794 --> 03:18:10.237]  He tells you China's the problem, which it is, but they're taking our free speech right now.
[03:18:10.317 --> 03:18:13.180]  Social media platforms, Facebook, Twitter... There goes Rubio.
[03:18:13.520 --> 03:18:18.745]  Do you believe that these platforms need to be regulated like a public utility and how do you go about doing this?
[03:18:19.065 --> 03:18:20.346]  Well, I'd prefer not to.
[03:18:20.366 --> 03:18:21.846]  For a competition, take care of that.
[03:18:21.906 --> 03:18:28.229]  But obviously, we're going to watch closely to make sure that these tools that are being used... I mean, one thing is to say we're going to go after foreign interference, design, and so on and so forth.
[03:18:28.249 --> 03:18:29.290]  But it's already going on here.
[03:18:29.350 --> 03:18:31.311]  Another thing is to say we're going to go after free speech.
[03:18:31.331 --> 03:18:32.812]  The Democrats are raping the Republicans.
[03:18:32.832 --> 03:18:34.372]  Because at some point, someone has to make a determination.
[03:18:34.432 --> 03:18:39.895]  What's the difference between, you know, misinformation from abroad and differences of opinion within the United States?
[03:18:39.915 --> 03:18:40.875]  Yeah, and that's happening here.
[03:18:40.895 --> 03:18:43.276]  It's a very fine line, and that's something we need to be careful about.
[03:18:43.296 --> 03:18:44.517]  We don't overreach in that direction.
[03:18:44.537 --> 03:18:46.158]  But then he doesn't know about InfoWars being banned.
[03:18:46.718 --> 03:18:48.639]  He doesn't know about the top news story in the country.
[03:18:48.839 --> 03:18:51.641]  I wonder why Rubio got so mad at me and threatened me physically.
[03:18:51.701 --> 03:18:51.781]  Huh?
[03:18:51.801 --> 03:18:52.261]  Poor Rubio.
[03:18:52.321 --> 03:18:52.721]  Oh yeah.
[03:18:52.741 --> 03:18:53.922]  Look at this little frat boy.
[03:18:54.002 --> 03:18:54.442]  So cool.
[03:18:54.482 --> 03:18:55.863]  Go back to your bath house.
[03:19:15.094 --> 03:19:15.854]  I don't like Rubio.
[03:19:15.874 --> 03:19:17.175]  I don't agree with his politics.
[03:19:17.215 --> 03:19:21.636]  But with that said, when he said, I'm not going to arrest you, I'm going to handle it myself.
[03:19:36.619 --> 03:19:37.640]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:19:37.660 --> 03:19:50.046]  There's got to be some sort of security there that's stopping him from actually... I mean, look, he's a member of the press.
[03:19:50.706 --> 03:19:51.307]  He's insane.
[03:19:52.227 --> 03:19:53.888]  He is insane.
[03:19:53.948 --> 03:19:55.729]  He is an absolute security risk.
[03:20:05.638 --> 03:20:19.766]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:23.568 --> 03:20:28.731]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:20:29.211 --> 03:20:31.553]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:20:35.496 --> 03:20:40.538]  Merkel confronts a defining moment as the global order realigns.
[03:20:41.539 --> 03:20:43.880]  Yeah, world government, open borders, it's all failing.
[03:20:44.640 --> 03:20:48.022]  Seven wounded, including two British tourists in Paris, knife attack.
[03:20:48.462 --> 03:20:55.986]  But the government says, oh, no Islamic connection, even though he was from Afghanistan, screaming Allah Akbar.
[03:20:56.006 --> 03:21:01.108]  2,500 Germans staged impromptu protests that were man-killed following fight with migrants who attacked him.
[03:21:02.677 --> 03:21:03.457]  We are the people.
[03:21:03.857 --> 03:21:06.959]  So, Gerald Solente was getting into populism being the answer, and I totally agree.
[03:21:06.979 --> 03:21:10.420]  It means nationalism, self-determination, or your own country.
[03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:14.602]  And that's what globalism is against, and these big corporations show.
[03:21:16.283 --> 03:21:18.623]  We're going to talk about that, and Gerald's going to take over right now.
[03:21:19.044 --> 03:21:21.945]  Please don't forget, I said the sale would end this weekend.
[03:21:22.065 --> 03:21:24.786]  It will end today, because I'm going to have new specials.
[03:21:25.266 --> 03:21:29.528]  I just get so busy that I don't get new ones.
[03:21:29.548 --> 03:21:31.929]  Because, look, our turmeric product bodies is amazing.
[03:21:32.816 --> 03:21:35.439]  I wanted to have enough for another month at full price.
[03:21:36.319 --> 03:21:42.786]  You know, we sell it super discounted until it's super low, and then we sell it at full price, hoping to be able to fund ourselves until the next big shipment comes in in October.
[03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:49.371]  Well, now I've kept it going so long, it'll probably just be sold out most of the next month.
[03:21:49.691 --> 03:21:50.792]  So if you want it, 50% off.
[03:21:50.832 --> 03:21:52.653]  Amazing turmeric product.
[03:21:52.793 --> 03:21:53.574]  95% curcuminoid.
[03:21:53.994 --> 03:21:54.754]  It's 50% off.
[03:21:55.015 --> 03:22:00.498]  The great bone broth formula, also with turmeric, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, so much more to mix it with your whey and all of it.
[03:22:00.798 --> 03:22:01.339]  It's incredible.
[03:22:01.359 --> 03:22:02.299]  Look at the benefits of that.
[03:22:02.640 --> 03:22:03.420]  That's 50% off.
[03:22:04.161 --> 03:22:04.521]  X2.
[03:22:04.721 --> 03:22:06.202]  I've told you, I've been put over a barrel.
[03:22:06.282 --> 03:22:07.603]  Deeper supply of the crystals.
[03:22:08.063 --> 03:22:08.864]  Very hard to get.
[03:22:09.224 --> 03:22:10.305]  Been having issues with it.
[03:22:10.345 --> 03:22:11.466]  Been having to pay more to get it.
[03:22:12.406 --> 03:22:14.868]  We have broken our contract with a proprietary product.
[03:22:15.809 --> 03:22:19.292]  Gotten out of the contract because I'm not going to sit there and do that.
[03:22:19.392 --> 03:22:21.434]  And we're trying to develop a new one, another deeper source.
[03:22:21.474 --> 03:22:24.737]  But this is the end of X2, at least for now.
[03:22:24.757 --> 03:22:26.999]  Suppose we've had problems.
[03:22:27.079 --> 03:22:27.520]  It's excellent.
[03:22:27.560 --> 03:22:28.040]  It's amazing.
[03:22:28.100 --> 03:22:31.383]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA253-3139.
[03:22:31.624 --> 03:22:33.646]  Your purchase makes it all possible.

[03:22:34.686 --> 03:22:35.888]  Get a Molan Lambe t-shirt.
[03:22:36.721 --> 03:22:40.364]  Get a ForbiddenInformationInfoWars.com shirt with my ugly mug on it.
[03:22:40.865 --> 03:22:41.746]  There's so much there.

[03:22:58.381 --> 03:23:01.364]  Mean Like a Wolverine, Re-Elect, I love I'm the Resistance shirt.
[03:23:02.881 --> 03:23:04.563]  The great George Washington shirt.
[03:23:04.643 --> 03:23:07.546]  It's got George Washington as a young man with a musket and a hatchet in his hand.
[03:23:07.566 --> 03:23:08.407]  The Paul Watson.
[03:23:08.427 --> 03:23:10.489]  Conservatism is the new counterculture.
[03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.751]  It's all there.
[03:23:11.871 --> 03:23:15.495]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:23:15.515 --> 03:23:21.141]  Now going back to Gerald Cilente at TrendsResearch.com, and at Twitter still for now, Gerald Cilente.
[03:23:22.925 --> 03:23:24.266]  57 days out, my friend.
[03:23:25.027 --> 03:23:25.807]  The craziness.
[03:23:26.448 --> 03:23:28.749]  I'm going to punch you out here and eat lunch while I watch and listen to you.
[03:23:28.769 --> 03:23:30.371]  Or I'll never shut up.
[03:23:31.631 --> 03:23:34.193]  But just your advice on populism being the answer.
[03:23:34.493 --> 03:23:34.854]  I agree.
[03:23:34.894 --> 03:23:36.055]  I'm putting out a populist message.
[03:23:36.355 --> 03:23:37.776]  The globalists fear that worldwide.
[03:23:37.816 --> 03:23:38.837]  They admit they're in trouble.
[03:23:39.077 --> 03:23:40.678]  With elections everywhere, they're losing.
[03:23:41.038 --> 03:23:43.200]  So they're stabbing the Donald Trump of Brazil.
[03:23:44.140 --> 03:23:47.921]  They're shooting the populist in the Netherlands.
[03:23:48.341 --> 03:23:49.501]  They are getting violent.
[03:23:49.781 --> 03:23:50.921]  They're acid attacking.
[03:23:51.502 --> 03:23:52.902]  So the left's getting more and more violent.
[03:23:52.942 --> 03:23:54.042]  But populism, you're right.
[03:23:54.462 --> 03:23:55.222]  We promote that.
[03:23:55.282 --> 03:23:58.143]  We promote real free societies, local government.
[03:23:58.463 --> 03:23:59.283]  We will win.
[03:23:59.503 --> 03:24:00.183]  Gerald Solente.
[03:24:01.243 --> 03:24:02.004]  Yes, you will.
[03:24:02.204 --> 03:24:03.904]  Because that's what the people want.
[03:24:04.604 --> 03:24:06.605]  And again, you're a threat to them.
[03:24:07.205 --> 03:24:08.765]  Look at your listenership.
[03:24:09.341 --> 03:24:15.210]  Compared to like, you know, an Anderson Cooper, you know, or any of most of them.
[03:24:15.871 --> 03:24:21.580]  And the reality is, it's the multinationals against we the people.
[03:24:22.458 --> 03:24:41.523]  And when you look at the tech giants that are against you, a handful of them, that monopolize the airwaves in the digital world, when you look at five corporations controlling 90% of the media, they don't want other voices taking away their business.
[03:24:42.104 --> 03:24:43.364]  That's the bottom line.
[03:24:43.982 --> 03:24:52.284]  So they're going after you for every little thing that you say that doesn't fit their agenda, and particularly the war agenda.
[03:24:52.744 --> 03:25:01.047]  For example, as I mentioned, when Apple took down the Alex Jones app for objectionable content.
[03:25:02.207 --> 03:25:12.650]  How about objectionable content when you had a content little container full of crap that Colin Powell sold We The People based on lies
[03:25:13.373 --> 03:25:26.017]  That took the United States to war against Iraq based on lies and all the proof was there before and after that he never had weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda.
[03:25:26.537 --> 03:25:33.119]  So everybody will take down Alex Jones, but no one will call out little Colin Powell.
[03:25:33.379 --> 03:25:34.940]  And you know why it's a colon?
[03:25:35.260 --> 03:25:38.961]  Because crap goes down the colon and out his mouth.
[03:25:39.721 --> 03:25:41.282]  How about Dick Cheney?
[03:25:42.068 --> 03:25:44.374]  How about George W. Bush?
[03:25:44.876 --> 03:25:46.300]  How about Rumsfeld?
[03:25:46.801 --> 03:25:48.866]  How about all these people?
[03:25:50.071 --> 03:26:06.761]  That overtly, with all of the evidence, hard evidence, substantiated facts, that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, did not have ties to al-Qaeda, they lied us into war.
[03:26:07.301 --> 03:26:09.303]  How come no one's calling them out?
[03:26:09.703 --> 03:26:16.447]  Oh, but we're going to go after Alex Jones because he has, quote, objectionable content.
[03:26:17.265 --> 03:26:36.972]  We can let go of all of the people, the Goldman Sachs gang, the Merrill Lynch mob, all the banksters that robbed you and we the people of our money, have been convicted of frauds.
[03:26:37.902 --> 03:26:40.683]  And not one head goes to jail.
[03:26:41.223 --> 03:26:51.607]  Instead, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, the arrogant Obama, they're too big to fail and I'm going to make them bigger.
[03:26:52.027 --> 03:26:59.370]  But we're going to go after Alex Jones because he points out what these people are doing.
[03:27:00.190 --> 03:27:06.993]  Alex Jones points out what a fraud the Federal Reserve
[03:27:07.845 --> 03:27:08.666]  System is.
[03:27:09.066 --> 03:27:16.512]  The Federal Reserve, as we all know that listens to InfoWars, they're as federal as Federal Express.
[03:27:17.292 --> 03:27:24.618]  And he has guests on like myself and Ron Paul that point that out and others like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:27:25.499 --> 03:27:29.322]  That's why the media is silencing Alex Jones.
[03:27:30.203 --> 03:27:35.707]  Does Alex Jones use language and do things that they don't approve of?
[03:27:36.477 --> 03:27:37.918]  You have to be proper.
[03:27:38.378 --> 03:27:39.779]  Yes, you have to be proper.
[03:27:40.119 --> 03:27:44.742]  Like that Tony Blair, who speaks with that wonderful English accent.
[03:27:45.122 --> 03:27:49.265]  A low-life, piece of garbage, lying murderer!
[03:27:50.089 --> 03:27:53.290]  But he's proper, so we'll let him get away with it.
[03:27:53.650 --> 03:28:01.732]  Because we all act proper as we wage wars that slaughter millions of innocent people based on lies.
[03:28:02.112 --> 03:28:11.794]  But we'll go after Alex Jones because he has, quote, objectionable content, and we don't like him.
[03:28:12.549 --> 03:28:13.830]  That's what's going on.
[03:28:14.230 --> 03:28:21.274]  And that's why I recommend to everyone listening, do everything you can to support Alex Jones.
[03:28:21.694 --> 03:28:41.966]  Support InfoWars and others that speak the truth and that are against the establishment, the multinationals that are robbing us of our freedom, of our dignity, our right to think for ourselves, and also
[03:28:43.479 --> 03:28:44.860]  Freedom of speech.
[03:28:45.781 --> 03:28:59.055]  There should be outrage all over the country for what's going on and singling out Alex Jones while they let the official murderers get away with murder.
[03:28:59.436 --> 03:29:00.457]  We'll be back in a bit.
[03:29:02.219 --> 03:29:05.661]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:29:05.681 --> 03:29:08.943]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:29:09.464 --> 03:29:15.268]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:29:15.728 --> 03:29:18.510]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:29:19.230 --> 03:29:22.695]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:29:23.055 --> 03:29:29.143]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:29:29.544 --> 03:29:34.510]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:29:35.251 --> 03:29:38.653]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:29:39.173 --> 03:29:45.717]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:29:46.377 --> 03:29:51.060]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:29:51.480 --> 03:29:56.703]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:29:57.283 --> 03:30:01.246]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:30:01.926 --> 03:30:04.191]  I think it is an utter lie.
[03:30:05.053 --> 03:30:09.443]  Most of the claims that people are making against you in the press and in court, they're just not true.
[03:30:13.237 --> 03:30:21.920]  I mean, I remember a month ago when you had your hearing here in Austin, I was there and I found it very unfortunate that the press wasn't allowed in the courtroom.
[03:30:21.940 --> 03:30:24.120]  They weren't allowed to have cameras in the courtroom.
[03:30:24.140 --> 03:30:25.140]  The judge didn't want that.
[03:30:25.761 --> 03:30:33.943]  I was distressed about that because as I sat there in the courtroom, I had not watched the entire video presentation myself until that point.
[03:30:34.203 --> 03:30:37.204]  I wanted to keep my mind clear and I said, let's just see how this looks.
[03:30:38.204 --> 03:30:43.795]  And when you watch that video, I'm looking around at the people in the courtroom thinking, how can you be here to protest that?
[03:30:45.117 --> 03:30:47.418]  Because, you know, you're... But the New York Times went out and lied about it.
[03:30:47.738 --> 03:30:50.939]  Waving attorney's fees, saying I'm sorry the family's died years ago.
[03:30:51.119 --> 03:30:51.300]  True.
[03:30:51.340 --> 03:30:53.260]  Apologizing is out of context years ago.
[03:30:53.340 --> 03:30:53.981]  All of those facts.
[03:30:54.061 --> 03:30:55.421]  Dozens of videos of that.
[03:30:55.481 --> 03:31:00.003]  But the news sat there, the papers, and murdered the truth and didn't tell any of it.
[03:31:00.063 --> 03:31:06.566]  No, the story that they had was you trying to take $100,000 out of Sandy Hook's parents' pockets when you specifically waived that.
[03:31:07.066 --> 03:31:09.447]  I mean, that was... Even though them suing under law could trigger that.
[03:31:10.753 --> 03:31:12.354]  In fact, it should trigger that.
[03:31:12.595 --> 03:31:18.379]  But what was that for you to see us waive the fees, which you say you've never seen anybody do, and then the media says the opposite, that's sitting there?
[03:31:18.679 --> 03:31:19.619]  It didn't surprise me.
[03:31:19.860 --> 03:31:22.902]  You said they sighed when we waived it, like, oh!
[03:31:22.942 --> 03:31:24.743]  That took it away, oh!
[03:31:24.783 --> 03:31:27.345]  There was a groan in the courtroom.
[03:31:27.585 --> 03:31:29.706]  Because now they were gonna have to go out and lie!
[03:31:30.387 --> 03:31:37.331]  Well, I think it bothered them because people like to think in terms of comic book characters, Alex.
[03:31:37.351 --> 03:31:56.603]  You know, they don't... To look at you as a three-dimensional human being, where, you know, I might disagree with you on X, I agree with you on Y, I think, you know, Z that you say is funny, and I think, you know, B that you say is silly, and then, you know, and then we agree on these things, and, you know, that's called nuance, that's called interaction, you know, I mean, I... Diversity.
[03:31:56.883 --> 03:32:05.089]  Yeah, I mean, I enjoy hanging out with you even off camera because, you know, I understand you and we can exchange ideas and I feel like we're both smarter afterwards.
[03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:07.471]  That's what real interaction is.
[03:32:07.691 --> 03:32:12.095]  But, you know, when you have this story where there has to be a villain, you've got to be the villain.
[03:32:13.246 --> 03:32:14.107]  God, what do you do?
[03:32:14.567 --> 03:32:20.590]  You know, if, I mean, there's a reason why in Star Wars you never see Darth Vader sitting there petting a kitten, right?
[03:32:20.631 --> 03:32:22.051]  There's just, they don't want to humanize him.
[03:32:22.151 --> 03:32:23.832]  Doesn't fit the story, right?
[03:32:23.892 --> 03:32:25.734]  So, you know, you don't have that, right?
[03:32:25.814 --> 03:32:32.358]  Humanizing somebody and looking at it that way and thinking, wow, maybe some of this comic book narrative isn't accurate.
[03:32:33.238 --> 03:32:38.459]  And that just stuck a spear in the side of this character and deflated it.
[03:32:39.079 --> 03:32:46.040]  Because they're thinking, Mike, oh no, this is devastating to our narrative that he's this evil ogre.
[03:32:46.260 --> 03:32:49.761]  When he says, no, these parents have lost enough.
[03:32:50.041 --> 03:32:54.442]  When he said, these parents have lost enough, we're waiving everything over and above a dollar.
[03:32:56.942 --> 03:32:57.563]  What do you got now?
[03:32:58.423 --> 03:32:59.223]  Where's the evil now?
[03:33:06.630 --> 03:33:11.271]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.332 --> 03:33:19.353]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:28.275 --> 03:33:30.175]  Hi, this is Gerald.
[03:33:31.357 --> 03:33:32.358]  Glad to be here.
[03:33:32.458 --> 03:33:36.300]  Gerald Cilenti with the Trends Research Institute, publisher of the Trends Journal.
[03:33:36.821 --> 03:33:47.688]  And always an honor to be on InfoWars, especially as the major media attack it, because all they are a bunch of prostitutes.
[03:33:48.468 --> 03:34:00.716]  They get paid to put out for their corporate whoremasters, and nobody could pay Alex Jones enough to say what they want him to say, or myself.
[03:34:01.713 --> 03:34:07.995]  And that's why I'm urging you all to continue to do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[03:34:08.035 --> 03:34:16.058]  And one of the great products that they have that's 40% off is Knockout, the powerful sleep aid.
[03:34:16.458 --> 03:34:22.941]  That's right, 40% off only at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:34:23.581 --> 03:34:25.061]  The research is clear.
[03:34:25.742 --> 03:34:29.763]  Millions around the world struggle to achieve proper sleep each night.
[03:34:30.686 --> 03:34:32.968]  And the negative health effects are staggering.
[03:34:33.028 --> 03:34:43.795]  InfoWars Life has developed a natural sleep support formula that incorporates the most powerful ingredients for the most affordable price.
[03:34:44.395 --> 03:34:57.704]  Knockout goes above and beyond many natural sleep formulas by bringing together powerful natural sleep remedies like melatonin, valerian root extract,
[03:34:58.977 --> 03:35:00.939]  And that's just to name a few.
[03:35:01.700 --> 03:35:05.383]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:35:05.883 --> 03:35:07.665]  It's needed now more than ever.
[03:35:08.565 --> 03:35:10.707]  Censorship is a major trend.
[03:35:11.448 --> 03:35:15.571]  It's going to be one of our top trends for 2019.
[03:35:16.672 --> 03:35:19.094]  It's not only Alex Jones they're going after.
[03:35:19.715 --> 03:35:23.478]  It's from, you could go to the World Socialist website.
[03:35:24.619 --> 03:35:25.980]  They're after them as well.
[03:35:26.747 --> 03:35:28.548]  And other anti-war sites.
[03:35:29.548 --> 03:35:43.655]  Google is attacking them, and Infowars is just one of the many of the anti-establishment, I should say one of the few, of the anti-establishment that's being attacked.
[03:35:44.815 --> 03:35:49.598]  The higher the numbers, the louder the voices, the bigger the names, the greater the attack.
[03:35:50.758 --> 03:35:54.360]  So as I mentioned to Alex, this is part of the populist movement.
[03:35:55.290 --> 03:35:58.632]  And by the way, it's only the banksters that call it populism.
[03:35:59.453 --> 03:36:02.635]  It's people want to protect their heritage and their identity.
[03:36:03.555 --> 03:36:06.778]  They don't want to get involved in foreign entanglements.
[03:36:07.558 --> 03:36:17.365]  And they don't want to be a part of a multinational banking system that robs them of their money, their dignity, and now their freedom of speech.
[03:36:18.245 --> 03:36:22.508]  There should be outrage all over the airwaves.
[03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:26.131]  About the silencing of Alex Jones.
[03:36:26.952 --> 03:36:30.433]  This is in direct violation of our First Amendment.
[03:36:31.134 --> 03:36:32.494]  Freedom of speech.
[03:36:33.355 --> 03:36:34.335]  But we've lost that.
[03:36:35.396 --> 03:36:39.017]  And when you look at the words that was spoken.
[03:36:40.738 --> 03:36:43.600]  At the Senate Intelligence Committee meeting.
[03:36:45.681 --> 03:36:46.261]  Recently.
[03:36:47.398 --> 03:37:05.104]  And I use that word lightly because there is no intelligence in the new year in the American Senate at all by none other than Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey.
[03:37:06.904 --> 03:37:12.146]  You read their comments and these tech giants, this is some of what they said.
[03:37:12.776 --> 03:37:19.077]  Will aggressively and relentlessly smoke out, quote, bad actors and block them.
[03:37:21.398 --> 03:37:26.539]  And they'll block you, of course, from sharing, quote, undesired content.
[03:37:27.539 --> 03:37:31.000]  Who anointed these geeks?
[03:37:32.520 --> 03:37:39.141]  I should say Lord geeks, because now they're majesties, because they could do what they want.
[03:37:40.542 --> 03:37:42.342]  Who anointed them to tell us
[03:37:43.334 --> 03:37:49.862]  What good and bad is, what truth and lies are, when that's what they sell most of the time.
[03:37:50.443 --> 03:37:52.666]  On the lies end, not the truth.
[03:37:54.588 --> 03:38:00.115]  Sandberg said, we will find content that violates our policies.
[03:38:00.976 --> 03:38:02.118]  We will take it down.
[03:38:03.320 --> 03:38:10.803]  This is an arms race, and that means we need to be ever more vigilant.
[03:38:11.303 --> 03:38:13.984]  Vigilant, vigilant.
[03:38:14.504 --> 03:38:17.105]  Greenberg, Sandberg, Iceberg.
[03:38:17.626 --> 03:38:18.666]  What's the difference?
[03:38:20.567 --> 03:38:21.927]  This is disgusting.
[03:38:23.048 --> 03:38:23.888]  What policies?
[03:38:26.229 --> 03:38:28.150]  Who makes these decisions?
[03:38:31.690 --> 03:38:33.511]  What about freedom of speech?
[03:38:34.792 --> 03:38:36.474]  What about the First Amendment?
[03:38:38.796 --> 03:38:44.320]  And again, Senate Intelligence, not a shred of it among them.
[03:38:46.882 --> 03:38:59.792]  None of them, none of them debated the facts that they are going to tell us what's good for us, what we should know and what we should believe.
[03:39:03.527 --> 03:39:13.513]  And as part of official investigations, government officials sometimes request data about people who use Facebook.
[03:39:14.474 --> 03:39:28.502]  Sanders went on to say, we have an easily accessible online portal and processes in place to handle these government requests.
[03:39:29.603 --> 03:39:30.904]  So more censorship
[03:39:32.114 --> 03:39:36.918]  And more control of content by Big Brother.
[03:39:39.780 --> 03:39:41.001]  This is America?
[03:39:42.002 --> 03:39:43.023]  What a joke.
[03:39:43.423 --> 03:39:49.668]  Oh, and by the way, folks, because Obama's out there now folksing us again.
[03:39:50.308 --> 03:39:53.791]  Yeah, he can't get over folksing us all the time.
[03:39:55.032 --> 03:39:58.435]  This is the guy, Obama, that increased
[03:40:00.506 --> 03:40:08.088]  The spy agencies ability and gave them more power to spy on us.
[03:40:09.828 --> 03:40:22.371]  And now big tech is working hand in glove with the spy agencies right here in black and white to watch everything you say, follow everything you do.
[03:40:22.391 --> 03:40:28.313]  And if they don't like it, they're going after you.
[03:40:29.597 --> 03:40:35.461]  And these threats against Alex Jones and Donald Trump are disgusting.
[03:40:36.202 --> 03:40:47.509]  And if we had any kind of media at all in this world, in this country, I should say, that had any sensitivity or sensibility, they would be championing against it.
[03:40:48.130 --> 03:40:49.451]  But only silence.
[03:40:50.651 --> 03:40:52.213]  As a matter of fact, they're promoting it.
[03:40:52.933 --> 03:40:55.755]  They're promoting hatred and division.
[03:40:56.976 --> 03:40:58.397]  So again, do what you can
[03:40:59.204 --> 03:41:00.865]  To support InfoWars.
[03:41:01.645 --> 03:41:05.386]  Put your money and your mind where your heart is.
[03:41:06.706 --> 03:41:17.129]  Because without InfoWars, without the Trends Journal, without Ron Paul, without just a few of us, there'll be none of us.
[03:41:19.150 --> 03:41:22.691]  It is becoming the fascist state of America.
[03:41:23.691 --> 03:41:26.452]  Again, too big to fail?
[03:41:27.938 --> 03:41:29.779]  This isn't the death of capitalism.
[03:41:30.159 --> 03:41:31.940]  Capitalism was killed with that.
[03:41:33.221 --> 03:41:37.263]  In capitalism, no one's too big to fail.
[03:41:37.784 --> 03:41:39.885]  You rise and fall on your own merits.
[03:41:40.445 --> 03:41:42.246]  But we, the little people, can fail.
[03:41:42.927 --> 03:41:44.388]  And that's what's going on now.
[03:41:45.108 --> 03:41:47.209]  The bigs are taking control of everything.
[03:41:48.990 --> 03:41:51.011]  They own us, if we let them.
[03:41:52.692 --> 03:41:57.295]  This is a time for an evolution, as well as a revolution.
[03:41:58.266 --> 03:42:03.729]  And that means to rise above the level of what they're doing.
[03:42:05.369 --> 03:42:11.973]  Speak out, stand up, and support those who you believe.
[03:42:12.993 --> 03:42:14.114]  Demand the truth.
[03:42:15.434 --> 03:42:19.796]  Demand open minds and many different directions.
[03:42:20.757 --> 03:42:22.418]  You get that with InfoWars.
[03:42:22.838 --> 03:42:25.159]  You get that with our magazine, The Trends Journal.
[03:42:26.147 --> 03:42:28.168]  You get that with Ron Paul and others.
[03:42:29.289 --> 03:42:31.431]  But they're going to try to take it away from us.
[03:42:32.892 --> 03:42:36.855]  So support what you can, buy what you can.
[03:42:38.436 --> 03:42:46.802]  The products, I buy them from InfoWars because I believe in them and they've made me feel really, really good.
[03:42:47.941 --> 03:42:54.234]  There's a lot going on besides this, and we're going to come back in just a little bit to talk about it.
[03:42:54.675 --> 03:42:58.182]  Particularly, watch what's going on with the economy.
[03:42:58.222 --> 03:42:59.325]  We'll be back.
[03:43:02.702 --> 03:43:07.043]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:43:07.543 --> 03:43:16.445]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[03:43:17.005 --> 03:43:21.566]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[03:43:21.786 --> 03:43:32.108]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[03:43:32.108 --> 03:43:32.608]  We're good to go!
[03:44:02.938 --> 03:44:05.919]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[03:44:06.219 --> 03:44:06.499]  Go ahead.
[03:44:06.740 --> 03:44:12.322]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:44:12.522 --> 03:44:13.642]  I'd done the War Room.
[03:44:13.922 --> 03:44:16.363]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:44:16.403 --> 03:44:17.944]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:44:17.984 --> 03:44:18.624]  I was exhausted.
[03:44:18.945 --> 03:44:22.206]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[03:44:22.546 --> 03:44:27.188]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:44:27.268 --> 03:44:29.309]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:44:29.329 --> 03:44:29.969]  The same thing.
[03:44:30.029 --> 03:44:32.110]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[03:44:32.210 --> 03:44:33.431]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[03:44:33.611 --> 03:44:35.453]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[03:44:35.713 --> 03:44:41.297]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling.
[03:44:41.397 --> 03:44:42.818]  You know, you can sleep with it.
[03:44:43.158 --> 03:44:47.461]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[03:44:47.521 --> 03:44:50.303]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[03:44:50.463 --> 03:44:52.184]  This is the best combination I have found.
[03:44:52.304 --> 03:44:53.004]  It really works.
[03:44:53.224 --> 03:44:57.727]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[03:45:02.290 --> 03:45:03.531]  Believe me.
[03:45:18.223 --> 03:45:21.945]  Drew's only been here about four or five months, and he's behind the camera right now.
[03:45:22.245 --> 03:45:28.128]  And I've just done this big pitch for our new product for women that is the best products, the best ingredients we can come up with.
[03:45:28.749 --> 03:45:30.309]  And he said, man, you need to reshoot this.
[03:45:30.750 --> 03:45:32.531]  Literally 20 seconds ago, and I said, what?
[03:45:33.551 --> 03:45:35.172]  He goes, what's that Virginia Slims at?
[03:45:35.732 --> 03:45:40.155]  And I went, oh, the one about empowering women smoking cigarettes and killing themselves.
[03:45:40.195 --> 03:45:42.616]  He goes, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[03:45:44.844 --> 03:45:46.826]  And that just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:45:47.567 --> 03:45:56.895]  So hundreds of millions of women died of lung cancer because the whole feminist movement from the 20s to the 40s was funded by the cigarette makers to get women to smoke.
[03:45:56.995 --> 03:46:02.520]  And they continue that line into the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s saying, you've come a long way.
[03:46:02.981 --> 03:46:04.682]  You can smoke Virginia Slims.
[03:46:05.083 --> 03:46:06.444]  You too can die of lung cancer.
[03:46:07.064 --> 03:46:15.847]  So, Stephen Colbert and all these programs demonize me for promoting known herbs, known vitamins, known trace minerals that are so critical to women.
[03:46:16.067 --> 03:46:18.848]  My god, iodine is absolutely king, the good allergy.
[03:46:19.148 --> 03:46:25.790]  And then I'm the bad guy all over the news for promoting healthy formulas, but they are promoting pure poison.
[03:46:25.890 --> 03:46:28.691]  So, hey, yeah, women, you've come a long way.
[03:46:28.731 --> 03:46:30.572]  The families are broken up, society's falling apart.
[03:46:30.652 --> 03:46:31.532]  We're good to go.
[03:47:06.136 --> 03:47:10.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.720 --> 03:47:28.193]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:47:28.934 --> 03:47:30.395]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:33.343 --> 03:47:34.383]  Yes, yes, yes.
[03:47:34.503 --> 03:47:39.965]  Defending the Republic and the enemies of censorship right now.
[03:47:40.705 --> 03:47:44.626]  That there is not outrage spreading across America.
[03:47:45.627 --> 03:47:53.889]  Taking Alex Jones off the air in so many different platforms is a disgrace on the digital world.
[03:47:55.630 --> 03:47:56.350]  What has he done?
[03:47:58.260 --> 03:48:02.584]  So again, it's up to you to keep the voices alive.
[03:48:03.084 --> 03:48:08.429]  And you can do that by buying the great products that InfoWars has available.
[03:48:08.989 --> 03:48:15.194]  Among them, Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel from InfoWars Life.
[03:48:15.995 --> 03:48:20.719]  Burns, scrapes, cuts and wounds are a natural part of life.
[03:48:21.780 --> 03:48:26.504]  That's why it's so important to be ready to protect them from infection.
[03:48:27.378 --> 03:48:40.847]  With Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel from InfoWars Life, you can reduce the threat of infection and irritation with a portable, affordable, and easy-to-use solution.
[03:48:41.668 --> 03:48:57.158]  Based on the powerful SilverSol technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano-silver market, Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel has been evaluated and FDA-cleared
[03:48:57.941 --> 03:49:08.229]  In standard tests to reduce the levels of common microorganisms, fungi, pathogens on the surface of wounds.
[03:49:09.029 --> 03:49:14.374]  So that's just one of the many great products that are available at InfoWars.
[03:49:14.634 --> 03:49:26.543]  And again, do what you can to keep the voice of InfoWars growing and gaining rather than the tech giants
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:32.104]  And the prostitutes doing what they can to restrain it.
[03:49:34.427 --> 03:49:37.870]  And I talk about the prostitutes and propaganda.
[03:49:38.491 --> 03:49:41.454]  You don't need anything better than this front page story.
[03:49:41.474 --> 03:49:50.102]  In today's New York Times, they call themselves the paper of records.
[03:49:51.010 --> 03:49:58.914]  I call them the toilet paper of record because it's only good for one thing when you see a story like this and many others that they write.
[03:50:00.334 --> 03:50:02.815]  A turncoat spy went free.
[03:50:03.696 --> 03:50:08.718]  Putin, look at that picture, never forgave him.
[03:50:09.539 --> 03:50:16.802]  They're talking about that guy, Skirple, or Screeple, that
[03:50:17.617 --> 03:50:20.038]  Was poisoned, with that deadly poison!
[03:50:20.498 --> 03:50:22.959]  The deadliest one on Earth, I tells ya!
[03:50:22.979 --> 03:50:27.040]  And the guy's still alive, and so is his daughter, but we won't talk about that.
[03:50:28.641 --> 03:50:40.665]  This is propaganda that they're selling, and it goes back to what Alex was saying about the coup against Trump, for wanting peace with Putin.
[03:50:42.966 --> 03:50:43.306]  Peace.
[03:50:46.778 --> 03:50:51.441]  Well, you have Obama telling us folks that we gotta watch them Russians.
[03:50:53.222 --> 03:51:04.109]  While the Democrats, those peace-loving Democrats, yep, 41 Senators, Democratic Senators, voted for the defense bill.
[03:51:05.349 --> 03:51:07.971]  Seven voted against it.
[03:51:07.991 --> 03:51:13.735]  139 Democrats, those peace-loving Democrats, voted for the defense bill.
[03:51:13.755 --> 03:51:15.196]  49 voted against it.
[03:51:17.404 --> 03:51:17.844]  War.
[03:51:18.985 --> 03:51:20.886]  That's what the Democrats are selling.
[03:51:22.647 --> 03:51:27.090]  And on some issues, I agree with Trump, particularly on the trade issues.
[03:51:27.871 --> 03:51:32.514]  You look at what just happened with the trade data that came out last week.
[03:51:33.374 --> 03:51:35.315]  China's trade surplus with U.S.
[03:51:35.395 --> 03:51:39.838]  grows to new records in August.
[03:51:39.858 --> 03:51:43.120]  $31.05 billion.
[03:51:43.741 --> 03:51:45.802]  Who would do business under those terms?
[03:51:46.658 --> 03:52:00.700]  If this was the arrogant Obama, who of course lied when he was running for office in 2007, in the election in 2008, that he was going to revisit NAFTA and never did.
[03:52:01.861 --> 03:52:12.902]  If Obama wanted to renegotiate these lousy trade deals brought to you by Bill Clinton, primarily, boy would the media be applauding him.
[03:52:13.823 --> 03:52:16.163]  But Trump is doing it, that's not good.
[03:52:17.754 --> 03:52:24.056]  And again, what I disagree with Trump is in the war levels, but he wants to get out of Afghanistan.
[03:52:25.117 --> 03:52:33.260]  And the word from sources, I was one of the speakers at Ron Paul's Peace and Prosperity Conference in Washington, D.C.
[03:52:33.480 --> 03:52:42.963]  It should say that the Washington Marriott Hotel at Dulles Airport in August.
[03:52:44.406 --> 03:52:52.369]  A number of the speakers there were saying that Trump wants peace in Afghanistan, but the military-industrial complex doesn't want him to have it.
[03:52:55.450 --> 03:52:58.430]  And again, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Obama.
[03:52:58.911 --> 03:53:01.011]  Folks, gotta go into Libya.
[03:53:02.452 --> 03:53:04.973]  Here's stories that don't make the toilet paper of record.
[03:53:06.893 --> 03:53:07.353]  Libya.
[03:53:07.613 --> 03:53:11.315]  Armed groups vie for control in deadly Tripoli clashes.
[03:53:12.215 --> 03:53:12.555]  Ah, yes.
[03:53:14.735 --> 03:53:16.295]  It's a civil war over there.
[03:53:17.536 --> 03:53:20.257]  The richest nation in Africa now destroyed.
[03:53:23.098 --> 03:53:24.218]  Thanks to Obama.
[03:53:25.078 --> 03:53:27.359]  Assad has to go, Obama says.
[03:53:27.959 --> 03:53:34.541]  Yup, and so did 600,000 innocent civilians as they launched the war against Syria.
[03:53:39.002 --> 03:53:40.743]  Today, Libya.
[03:53:40.823 --> 03:53:44.164]  National oil corporation's Tripoli offices attacked.
[03:53:45.020 --> 03:53:50.782]  At least four killed, including two National Oil Company employees.
[03:53:55.764 --> 03:53:58.725]  That's why they don't want Alex Jones on the air.
[03:53:59.885 --> 03:54:03.226]  They want to keep selling war, keep selling hate.
[03:54:05.407 --> 03:54:08.808]  Like the toilet paper record with a story like this.
[03:54:10.208 --> 03:54:14.350]  But they barely print stories like this.
[03:54:15.177 --> 03:54:18.660]  Kremlin denies Russian involvement, next buys poisoning.
[03:54:20.201 --> 03:54:21.322]  Of course they're going to deny it.
[03:54:21.662 --> 03:54:23.504]  They would deny it even if they did it, of course.
[03:54:24.004 --> 03:54:25.765]  This guy was a nobody from nowhere.
[03:54:25.785 --> 03:54:27.367]  A screeple.
[03:54:28.087 --> 03:54:30.649]  And they're trying to make an issue that he was a somebody.
[03:54:33.171 --> 03:54:39.316]  So, I want to move on in the last few minutes to talk about where the economy is going.
[03:54:40.377 --> 03:54:41.678]  We've been writing a lot about it.
[03:54:43.200 --> 03:54:46.262]  Well, you have to watch out for what's going on in the emerging markets.
[03:54:47.823 --> 03:54:53.106]  As the dollar gets stronger, many other currencies get weaker.
[03:54:55.308 --> 03:54:59.911]  So when the dollar was weak, they borrowed a lot of money in dollars.
[03:55:00.771 --> 03:55:06.115]  And now, as the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates, their currencies are going down.
[03:55:08.056 --> 03:55:08.716]  They're weakening.
[03:55:09.777 --> 03:55:11.298]  Hey, they got all that debt to pay.
[03:55:11.923 --> 03:55:14.383]  Up, now they gotta pay it back with more of their dough.
[03:55:15.904 --> 03:55:16.704]  Argentina.
[03:55:17.644 --> 03:55:18.764]  This guy McCree.
[03:55:19.324 --> 03:55:25.565]  All of the prostitutes and the New York Slime, excuse me, Times, was number one on that.
[03:55:26.786 --> 03:55:28.126]  Champion this guy.
[03:55:28.646 --> 03:55:29.926]  Smart businessman.
[03:55:30.346 --> 03:55:32.467]  Gonna bring in smart business people.
[03:55:32.827 --> 03:55:35.787]  We're gonna turn Argentina around, and boy, he did.
[03:55:36.367 --> 03:55:39.288]  Hey, what do we got over here for interest rates?
[03:55:40.592 --> 03:55:43.153]  What is the Fed overnight rate?
[03:55:43.173 --> 03:55:46.234]  1.75 to 2.0?
[03:55:47.414 --> 03:55:48.094]  How about 65%?
[03:55:48.754 --> 03:55:52.895]  That's what their interest rate is.
[03:55:54.256 --> 03:55:56.216]  Their currency is declining.
[03:55:56.296 --> 03:56:00.897]  Down almost 50% this year.
[03:56:01.278 --> 03:56:01.498]  Over 50%.
[03:56:03.278 --> 03:56:04.478]  The Turkish economy.
[03:56:07.019 --> 03:56:07.699]  Up a little bit.
[03:56:08.980 --> 03:56:10.360]  Their currency way down.
[03:56:11.631 --> 03:56:13.473]  Over 40% against the dollar this year.
[03:56:14.574 --> 03:56:14.974]  India.
[03:56:16.075 --> 03:56:17.736]  The rupee, all-time low.
[03:56:18.276 --> 03:56:21.379]  Indonesia and rupiah, two decades low.
[03:56:22.540 --> 03:56:24.021]  One country after another.
[03:56:24.721 --> 03:56:25.122]  Russia.
[03:56:26.322 --> 03:56:27.583]  The Brazilian real.
[03:56:27.643 --> 03:56:32.267]  Hey, South Africa is in a recession now, and they ran their way down.
[03:56:33.388 --> 03:56:40.053]  I'm mentioning all this because it could be a contagion effect, and it may well happen.
[03:56:41.209 --> 03:56:48.231]  Because this economy in the United States was boosted by bailing out the bigs.
[03:56:49.371 --> 03:57:00.455]  Negative and zero interest rate policy worldwide, stock buybacks, mergers and acquisitions through quantitative easing.
[03:57:01.935 --> 03:57:07.957]  So if the Fed raises rates too much, if they raise them two more times this year,
[03:57:09.005 --> 03:57:28.071]  Start watching the economy go down and all of these countries that are rich in dollar debt and poor in their own currencies are going to go down big time and China will fall with the biggest boom and bust.
[03:57:28.952 --> 03:57:34.613]  So, we don't give it financial advice but we believe gold is near the bottom.
[03:57:35.514 --> 03:57:35.914]  And again,
[03:57:37.643 --> 03:57:39.747]  So is the American media.
[03:57:40.448 --> 03:57:44.656]  Because they're at the bottom or else they wouldn't be doing what they're doing to Alex Jones.
[03:57:45.557 --> 03:57:46.860]  Thank you for having me on.
[03:57:46.880 --> 03:57:48.943]  We'll see you real soon.
[03:57:49.565 --> 03:57:50.827]  And support InfoWars.

[03:57:57.095 --> 03:58:00.516]  There's been extensive research on silver salt technology.
[03:58:00.876 --> 03:58:10.280]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity
[03:58:10.920 --> 03:58:14.345]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[03:58:14.706 --> 03:58:19.653]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[03:58:19.713 --> 03:58:22.076]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[03:58:22.356 --> 03:58:26.983]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[03:58:27.023 --> 03:58:27.624]  Ah, you don't want that.
[03:58:28.004 --> 03:58:31.805]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[03:58:32.025 --> 03:58:34.706]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[03:58:34.966 --> 03:58:38.268]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[03:58:38.648 --> 03:58:43.950]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
