[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:09.872]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.358]  It's December 17th, 2018 on this Monday Global Edition.
[00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:30.199]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:34.702]  We'll be here live for the next four hours in the War Room with Owen Schroyer, Roger Stone and others.
[00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:45.749]  You know, I'm sitting back looking at all these different stories that I have to cover and the first one that sticks out with all the things happening around the world
[00:00:47.563 --> 00:00:50.685]  Here's a story that's top-linked up on DredgeReport.com.
[00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:57.148]  That's China and Russia perform controversial experiments to modify the atmosphere.
[00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.109]  Now isn't that funny?
[00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.032]  Because China and Russia admit that they can control the atmosphere.
[00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:11.435]  And when you look at the antenna array at the Sura base,
[00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:17.694]  It's identical, basically, and it's designed to harp.
[00:01:19.115 --> 00:01:25.298]  And so we should probably get Dr. Nick Begich back up in the near future, who first really started talking about it 25, 30 years ago.
[00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:39.305]  It's just frustrating to know there's all this weather modification going on, and to have the Department of Defense admitting it back in 1997, and have international treaties from 1978.
[00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:50.468]  Prohibiting both aerial spraying to manipulate atmosphere on a mass scale as a weapon, but also manipulating it using antenna arrays.
[00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:59.931]  So we talk about this, and they always have key people come out in pop culture, not just in news, and say, Alex Jones is crazy.
[00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:06.112]  He doesn't believe there's such a thing as condensation trails, which is totally real, from ice crystals.
[00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:11.034]  He thinks every trail you see behind an airplane is a chemtrail.
[00:02:12.383 --> 00:02:13.443]  And that is not what I'm saying.
[00:02:15.044 --> 00:02:30.091]  But the truth is, you can take heavily traveled jet corridors, and with ionizing radiation from these antenna arrays, they have now all over the world, you can then create nuclei and make it rain or not make it rain.
[00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:37.314]  So basically, they're microwaving the atmosphere from the bottom, they're spraying aluminum dioxide, barium salts at the top,
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.102]  They've got patents where it can be added to the jet fuel, then put out via the jet turbine engines, and the airline doesn't even know.
[00:02:46.942 --> 00:02:49.183]  They just agreed to buy fuel from a certain place.
[00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.083]  And this is a fact!
[00:02:52.564 --> 00:03:02.567]  And it's emblematic of everything else we cover, and everything else we do here, that this is an admitted system.
[00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:06.148]  Just like there's an admitted world government.
[00:03:06.808 --> 00:03:08.429]  There's an admitted plan to break up our families.
[00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:11.029]  There's an admitted plan to open up our borders.
[00:03:13.791 --> 00:03:18.954]  And you sit back and you watch this unfold, and the public are treated like children.
[00:03:21.435 --> 00:03:23.016]  It's like the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
[00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:32.282]  It made it law, and they signed other treaties so it became a global convention, that by 2000, all
[00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:46.014]  Cell phones would be triangulated via GPS using cell towers, and that would be used for geolocation and surveillance.
[00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:54.616]  And obviously has a lot of normal commercial uses, like when you're driving somewhere in your car and the map tells you right where to go.
[00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:02.757]  But that's what's frustrating is they go, oh, Jones is crazy.
[00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:03.597]  There's no such thing.
[00:04:03.617 --> 00:04:06.438]  And then, of course, it all became true because it was a law.
[00:04:08.311 --> 00:04:19.278]  And now, they've got it codified into these regulations that they're listening to you inside your house with AI computer recording everything and databasing it, even if you don't authorize it or even know it's happening.
[00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:29.605]  And 5G's coming out, where even the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Energy, the LA Times, the New York Times go, oh yeah, this does give you cancer.
[00:04:30.085 --> 00:04:31.026]  But we're just doing it.
[00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:37.610]  It's beyond secondhand smoke, so I don't want to just get up here and bet you complain about things, but
[00:04:38.803 --> 00:04:39.863]  That's what's going on.
[00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:41.644]  And it's a plan.
[00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.085]  And the system knows it's hurting us.
[00:04:45.325 --> 00:04:47.706]  The system knows what's taking place.
[00:04:48.826 --> 00:04:51.007]  The system knows what's unfolding.
[00:04:52.127 --> 00:04:56.989]  And we have to ask ourselves as a culture and a society, what are they doing we don't know about?
[00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:59.870]  And who in the world is running this thing?
[00:05:04.013 --> 00:05:13.900]  Hey, by now I'm sure that most of you know that there are always big discounts and unbelievable savings on a regular basis at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:11.635]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:18.177]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:34.202]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.582 --> 00:06:46.804]  Sometimes you get phone calls you just gotta take.
[00:06:47.104 --> 00:06:47.885]  And that was one of them.
[00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:50.627]  We're live here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:06:50.887 --> 00:06:51.407]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:51.447 --> 00:06:51.808]  Central.
[00:06:52.508 --> 00:06:53.389]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.152]  Don't forget David Knight with The David Knight Show doing a wonderful job informing the planet.
[00:06:57.832 --> 00:06:58.152]  8 a.m.
[00:06:58.192 --> 00:06:59.413]  Central until 11 a.m.
[00:06:59.433 --> 00:06:59.754]  Central.
[00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:02.736]  And of course The War Room with the amazing Owen Troyer.
[00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:03.577]  He really is amazing.
[00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:05.138]  And Roger Stone.
[00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:10.081]  A lot of big interesting things happening obviously behind the scenes.
[00:07:10.122 --> 00:07:12.984]  I'll be able to reveal to you in the near future.
[00:07:14.514 --> 00:07:16.654]  There is so much that I want to cover today.
[00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:22.936]  I want to be as judicious about this as I can to make sure we do get to cover it all.
[00:07:24.636 --> 00:07:41.860]  But if you just joined us in the first little segment, I got into the fact that, oh, the Smithsonian is reporting and the Daily Mail is reporting and a bunch of other publications are reporting China and Russia are working together to heat the atmosphere for weather control.
[00:07:43.348 --> 00:07:49.751]  Using large antenna arrays on the ground, directed by satellites in space.
[00:07:51.631 --> 00:08:10.579]  And they're just like the HAARP system that we've been talking about for 23 years here on air, that Dr. Dick Begich has been talking about for 27 years, and that we've all been demonized for talking about, even though I had the director of HAARP on one time.
[00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:17.871]  They had an Air Force colonel on the line watching when he could say, but this fellow was proud of his work, so he wanted to come on the show.
[00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:18.351]  He was a listener.
[00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:21.672]  We had a pilot interview, that's from like 15 years ago.
[00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:28.374]  And he said, well, yeah, we can even ignite the atmosphere with these antennas.
[00:08:29.054 --> 00:08:32.875]  And the colonel comes on during the break and says, that's it, doctor, no more, click.
[00:08:34.976 --> 00:08:39.677]  So the head of heart thought that he could just come on the show
[00:08:41.397 --> 00:08:48.439]  And assuage everyone's fears, but the Air Force Colonel in charge of the situation did not think that was the case.
[00:08:49.119 --> 00:08:50.159]  And that's just one more thing.
[00:08:50.319 --> 00:09:05.183]  Every few minutes when I'm going through stacks of news, but every few hours without even trying, there's all these things that are happening that are admitted, that for decades they denied, and then now they're just in the news just admitting it.
[00:09:06.483 --> 00:09:08.804]  It's very, very frustrating
[00:09:10.489 --> 00:09:21.315]  To know that hydrofluorosilicic acid lowers your IQ, lowers fertility, and acts as a toxic adjuvant or booster to other toxins and chemicals and drugs in the body.
[00:09:21.695 --> 00:09:25.777]  And I'm not just up here bitching and complaining about negative things just to do it.
[00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:29.279]  We should be asking ourselves, who are these technocrats?
[00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:30.519]  What's their plan?
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.860]  What are they building?
[00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:33.701]  Why are they like this?
[00:09:37.223 --> 00:09:38.864]  What are they planning to do to the atmosphere?
[00:09:40.106 --> 00:09:40.666]  of the planet.
[00:09:43.368 --> 00:09:44.089]  What's the endgame?
[00:09:44.609 --> 00:09:45.870]  Because it's classified.
[00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:54.776]  There's a treaty from 1978 banning weather modification for military use that the U.S.
[00:09:54.816 --> 00:09:59.919]  is a signatory to, but this is all going on on our relatively small planet.
[00:10:03.112 --> 00:10:14.059]  And just like I want to cause a public debate about this, I want to cause a public debate about why are they teaching worldwide five-year-old children that they're really a different sex?
[00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:24.566]  Why are they feeding us GMO crops that they know, many of the newer crops especially, kill farm animals that eat them and cause mutations?
[00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:27.829]  Why are they pushing all these deadly vaccines on us?
[00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:32.612]  Why are they spraying aluminum dioxide and barium salts into the atmosphere?
[00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:36.309]  What's really going on?
[00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:51.372]  And you can talk about the 5G, and talk about governments pushing and moving to make all the bartending, and waiters, and restaurants, and factories, and surgeons be robots.
[00:10:53.993 --> 00:11:01.634]  But we know there's an endgame to make humans obsolete, to take control of resources by governments and corporations,
[00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:07.985]  And to establish a system that is inducive to massive population reduction.
[00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:17.931]  And you can add, well, we're a small planet, there are too many people, we're lazy, we're stupid, not living on a planet where we're forced to do a lot of work, makes us more decadent.
[00:11:19.619 --> 00:11:32.845]  So let's go ahead and just remove the population, but the system's doing everything it can to make sure the public is as decadent and dumbed down as possible, to be able to then set the precedent and the atmosphere, both literally and figuratively, to remove us.
[00:11:34.066 --> 00:11:36.967]  So there's a big plan, and we ain't in it.
[00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:43.390]  And that's what's even more concerning, is that what we're talking about is reality.
[00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:45.531]  It's not our opinion.
[00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:55.649]  It's not something that we just wish it was one way or wish it wasn't the other.
[00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:02.471]  You can sit there and try to interpret globalism at different levels.
[00:12:02.491 --> 00:12:05.272]  You can sit there and try to look at the good side of it or the bad side of it.
[00:12:05.292 --> 00:12:17.197]  But when you get right down to brass tacks, this world government being set up is extremely vicious, extremely ruthless, extremely bloodthirsty.
[00:12:19.645 --> 00:12:47.433]  and creates horrible byproducts everywhere it goes and is making us weaker and stupider and is actually hurting the earth with all the open-air genetic engineering and the chemtrailing and the geoengineering and everything they're doing isn't just hurting humans, it's assaulting our very atmosphere to a negative effect for all life, it's assaulting our oceans, it's assaulting the entire genetic
[00:12:53.264 --> 00:13:00.172]  In short, the New World Order is a weapon system, a planetary terraforming operation.
[00:13:01.383 --> 00:13:19.688]  Genetically changing the planet's genetic makeup, changing the atmosphere's makeup, changing the tectonic activity of the planet, changing the oceans, changing all life, changing the radiological background, changing the magnetic background with all of the 3G and 4G and 5G and all the rest of it.
[00:13:19.848 --> 00:13:23.709]  And you can see it, you can feel it, you can smell it.
[00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.151]  And every metric, every measurement, every gauge,
[00:13:31.337 --> 00:13:39.060]  Every heads-up display we've got, every observation we see, shows this modern system is doing one thing.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.060]  Killing us.
[00:13:46.962 --> 00:13:50.284]  Some bad, bad, bad, bad people are in charge of this.
[00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:58.066]  And you can write a lot of science fiction books about who's really running it and what the endgame is, but I can tell you this.
[00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:00.127]  I got a pretty good idea.
[00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:14.195]  Because there's a lot of cleaner technologies, there's a lot of better technologies that the globalists go out of their way to ignore while they claim they run the entire environmental global movement and that they want to give you clean energy.
[00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:21.238]  So they ignore all the bad toxins and all the serious problems and say that carbon dioxide.
[00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:25.420]  Carbon dioxide.
[00:14:29.312 --> 00:14:39.638]  The one thing that really cleans the atmosphere like oxygen and water and sunlight, one of the four pillars of life on terra firma, is under constant assault.
[00:14:39.718 --> 00:14:43.040]  And now the Green Movement says, cut down trees to stop carbon.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.401]  Now, trees are bad!
[00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:49.159]  We're gonna go on a break and then look at some of the other contemporary things developing.
[00:14:49.939 --> 00:14:54.060]  Like, oh, the Guatemalan girl, seven, died being brought across to the U.S.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.280]  border over 2,000 miles.
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.820]  It's not her mother's fault.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.021]  It's not the caravan group that organized them's fault.
[00:15:00.581 --> 00:15:02.541]  No, no, it's not her fault for committing the crimes.
[00:15:02.961 --> 00:15:10.883]  No, no, it's America's fault when you take your child across a 200-mile stretch of desert through the most deadly smugglers the planet's ever seen.
[00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:13.779]  Amazing.
[00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:14.760]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:25.026]  Please do not forget, I want to thank you all for your amazing support, that you can do all your Christmas shopping at InfoWareStore.com and miss the traffic, the crowds, and get amazing deals, the biggest of our history.
[00:15:25.447 --> 00:15:40.376]  Every order, whether it's a $7.50 tube of fluoride-free toothpaste, 4-5 of colloidal silver and iodine, or whether it's DNA Force Plus, you all get a free t-shirt, free shipping, double Patriot points,
[00:15:41.698 --> 00:15:43.199]  And 50 to 75% off.
[00:15:43.219 --> 00:15:45.841]  So many of these are beyond loss leaders.
[00:15:45.881 --> 00:15:47.542]  We're just year-end clearance.
[00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:49.944]  And I really appreciate all your support.
[00:15:49.964 --> 00:15:53.746]  But this is a great way to get your orders in by the 19th.
[00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:58.770]  And you're guaranteed to get delivery, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:01.372]  Guaranteed to get delivery before Christmas.
[00:16:02.247 --> 00:16:03.067]  Look, we all do it.
[00:16:03.687 --> 00:16:05.008]  A lot of times we don't have a choice.
[00:16:05.028 --> 00:16:12.850]  You go on a trip, you book into a big globalist hotel that funds groups trying to take our guns and teach our five-year-old boys how to wear dresses.
[00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:13.730]  It's a fact.
[00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.871]  These corporations are out to conquer humanity, not to break up our families.
[00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:22.132]  And sometimes I can't find an item at another online shop, I go to Amazon.
[00:16:22.772 --> 00:16:24.833]  But I consciously try to not do it.
[00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:34.875]  In fact, when I use a product, or I hear about folks that like a product, I tend to get the product and then sell it at a huge discount at nymphomorestore.com.
[00:16:35.696 --> 00:16:43.763]  There aren't many places where you can go where you're going to find items lower than Amazon, because they have created a total monopoly.
[00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:47.066]  They get like $1.48 on every shipment from the federal government.
[00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:48.067]  We don't do that.
[00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:53.493]  But we still bring you deals so good that in many cases it's better than Amazon.
[00:16:53.633 --> 00:17:00.656]  So you're funding the second American Revolution, you're sticking it in the eye of the globalists, and you're getting great products all at the same time.
[00:17:01.056 --> 00:17:03.157]  It's called a 360 win.
[00:17:03.177 --> 00:17:12.600]  I talk about that a lot, but you're not getting a 360 win when you go to Target or Walmart and buy a toy that breaks when you get it out of the box.
[00:17:13.381 --> 00:17:14.241]  And I'm not judging you.
[00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:15.942]  I was at the mall a week ago,
[00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:21.599]  19-month-old daughter saw this little robot car.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:23.240]  She wanted it.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:24.901]  I bought it from the woman.
[00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:28.563]  It was broken when I got home and didn't work.
[00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:32.445]  Well, we're not selling products like that.
[00:17:32.485 --> 00:17:40.590]  Whether it's the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, the books, the videos, the patron apparel, it's all the very best at the lowest prices.
[00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.932]  So, we have the 12 Days of Christmas, the biggest sale in our history.
[00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:46.595]  We're selling inventory ahead of the end of the year.
[00:17:47.335 --> 00:17:52.480]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% is the lowest discount, up to 75%.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.741]  We're losing money on a lot of these.
[00:17:55.162 --> 00:17:56.363]  So we have the 12 days of Christmas.
[00:17:56.663 --> 00:17:59.586]  One item every day was particularly discounted up to 75%.
[00:17:59.726 --> 00:18:08.233]  We're bringing all of those sales back up until the 19th, when you're still guaranteed to get delivered to the continental United States before Christmas.
[00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:15.179]  Biggest sale in our history, extended, and now all the super sales!
[00:18:15.984 --> 00:18:16.844]  That we're already there.
[00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:20.926]  The very best sales the last 12 days are all brought back right now.
[00:18:21.246 --> 00:18:25.327]  While not fighting traffic and not fighting all the stupid crowds at the big box stores.
[00:18:25.627 --> 00:18:28.868]  And not giving your money to Jeff Bezos that literally wants to gang rape this country.
[00:18:29.428 --> 00:18:34.310]  These specials were such massive lost leaders that we can only promote them for 24 hours.
[00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:39.991]  But now we're bringing back all of our InfoWars Christmas Mega Specials and InfoWars4.com for a limited time.
[00:18:40.291 --> 00:18:42.792]  And many are already completely selling out.
[00:18:43.392 --> 00:18:44.633]  So everything we had
[00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:49.436]  It's back on sale at the lowest price, except for items that have already sold out.
[00:18:49.657 --> 00:18:55.261]  Most products are still there, but a lot are going to be selling out, including best-selling t-shirts, so take advantage of this right now.
[00:18:56.042 --> 00:19:05.310]  I have made the decision to completely sell out our entire 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.
[00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:11.455]  This is our last chance, and your last chance, to take advantage of these Christmas super specials, including Brain Force Plus,
[00:19:12.475 --> 00:19:16.416]  55% off and free shipping and a free t-shirt and double Patriot points.

[00:19:21.098 --> 00:19:22.218]  I mean there's too much to mention.

[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.421]  The Last Run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality 55% off free t-shirt free shipping double Patriot points.

[00:19:52.253 --> 00:19:53.554]  Alpha Power, it goes on and on.

[00:19:54.655 --> 00:19:55.456]  Be part of history.

[00:19:56.717 --> 00:19:57.617]  Win-win for everybody.
[00:19:57.918 --> 00:19:59.359]  Infowarstore.com
[00:20:06.503 --> 00:20:22.027]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.448 --> 00:20:29.589]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:32.430]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.973 --> 00:20:42.579]  Man, I'm looking at these headlines that are up at NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, and of course DrudgeReport.com.
[00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.403]  Russia and China band together on experiment to modify atmosphere.
[00:20:47.423 --> 00:20:49.044]  It's already been going on forever.
[00:20:49.384 --> 00:20:50.745]  It's just like our HAARP technology.
[00:20:51.306 --> 00:20:54.869]  Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion, and ideology on socials.
[00:20:55.469 --> 00:20:59.713]  And they invested $4,000, supposedly, to do it, compared to Hillary's billions.
[00:20:59.733 --> 00:21:00.634]  This is all red herrings.
[00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:04.177]  Scientists developing AI to combat hate speech.
[00:21:06.271 --> 00:21:09.853]  There's just so much to get to on that front and that brings us to our next point.
[00:21:34.718 --> 00:21:37.420]  We're going to have a pastor joining us who was a Muslim.
[00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:39.101]  He converted to Christianity.
[00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:48.287]  He tried to go to Mall of America, which I've been there, resembles a bazaar in Pakistan.
[00:21:50.489 --> 00:21:57.333]  And he was arrested for trying to hand out Christian literature, but the Muslims are allowed to proselytize all they want.
[00:21:59.174 --> 00:22:01.336]  Because here in the West, we're supposed to bend over backwards.
[00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:08.849]  to anything that destroys Christianity and free speech for Christians or conservatives.
[00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:12.372]  That leads us to this next point that I mentioned earlier.
[00:22:14.014 --> 00:22:21.921]  Guatemalan girl, seven, likely died of septis shock after boarding border crossing.
[00:22:23.102 --> 00:22:28.527]  The media had said that she died of dehydration, so because the border patrol didn't give her enough water.
[00:22:29.147 --> 00:22:30.849]  But what she really died of was her mother
[00:22:32.659 --> 00:22:38.981]  Taking her the 2,000-mile journey from Guatemala and the aid groups that lied to him about how they'd get across.
[00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:47.063]  And again, her mother that took her on this deadly, dangerous, illegal trek that only a crazy maniac would do.
[00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:50.383]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:22:50.443 --> 00:22:56.945]  All over the news, the headlines since Friday are, Trump murdered little girl.
[00:22:58.285 --> 00:23:00.066]  Border Patrol murdered little girl.
[00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:03.713]  That if we have a border, this is murdering people.
[00:23:03.753 --> 00:23:10.258]  In fact, open borders veto opposes wall because it's killing people.
[00:23:11.439 --> 00:23:13.741]  You mean third world collapsed countries are killing each other.
[00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:20.346]  The number of people dying at the US-Mexico border in some years has grown, O'Rourke said.
[00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:22.687]  And then he goes on to blame America.
[00:23:22.707 --> 00:23:28.252]  We're going to play some audio of that in a moment, but it's just outrageous.
[00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.634]  Hospital officials who treat a seven-year-old Guatemalan girl, bless her heart, who died in U.S.
[00:23:34.674 --> 00:23:39.658]  Border Patrol custody said she appears to have died from a sepsis shock.
[00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:50.286]  According to most detailed timeline of her death, at least for the Department of Homeland Security, autopsy results show that will provide the officials cause of death were still pending early today.
[00:23:50.706 --> 00:23:57.612]  The statement released by DHS elaborated on what happened to Jakelyn Kale,
[00:23:58.786 --> 00:24:05.172]  McQuinn in the hours after she and her father were apprehended by federal authorities and she became ill.
[00:24:07.168 --> 00:24:12.333]  She and her father, Neri Gilberto Cruz, were picked up by U.S.
[00:24:12.353 --> 00:24:20.781]  authorities with a group of 163 migrants on December 6th in a remote stretch of the New Mexico desert in Antelope Wells Port of Entry.
[00:24:21.421 --> 00:24:30.570]  Hours later, after being put on a bus to Border Patrol Station, she began vomiting and died December 8th at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.
[00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:42.375]  So you're taking your daughter across some of the most deadly stretches of desert where they're just, they found hundreds of, well they haven't found, hundreds of thousands have gone missing.
[00:24:42.755 --> 00:24:46.257]  The government of Mexico admits 200,000 have been killed the last decade.
[00:24:46.577 --> 00:24:54.001]  Hundreds of thousands missing and they've dug up tens of thousands of mass graves over the Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California border.
[00:24:54.061 --> 00:24:55.802]  I mean, you can't shake a stick.
[00:24:56.602 --> 00:25:00.544]  And not find a grave, or mass grave, or skeletons and skulls.
[00:25:00.724 --> 00:25:04.025]  I mean, it is beyond Road Warrior, as I call it.
[00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:08.366]  It's just absolutely fantastical, in a horrible way.
[00:25:10.587 --> 00:25:16.970]  And, again, they do the initial health screening, and they're just bringing in all these people, and they're just coming across the border, pouring in.
[00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:23.432]  But this one girl dies, and it's all of our collective faults.
[00:25:25.236 --> 00:25:29.621]  Not our country's fault, not our dad's fault, not the corruption's fault, not the bacteria's fault.
[00:25:34.547 --> 00:25:36.269]  It's your fault as an American.
[00:25:36.309 --> 00:25:37.851]  You're the bad person.
[00:25:38.351 --> 00:25:43.818]  So we're going to be looking more into this as more details come out, but just the exercise
[00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:52.482]  of the media, the controlled corporate media, instantly, when she died last week, saying, this is Trump's fault.
[00:25:52.502 --> 00:25:57.505]  You know, they faked the picture of Trump standing there with a little girl crying, said she was taken from her mother, which she wasn't.
[00:25:57.845 --> 00:26:02.548]  Turned out her mother routinely comes up out of Central America.
[00:26:02.568 --> 00:26:04.370]  For what reason, we're not sure.
[00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:10.534]  And then, she goes back.
[00:26:11.174 --> 00:26:13.716]  But she uses the children as a human shield.
[00:26:14.582 --> 00:26:15.463]  But that's okay.
[00:26:16.824 --> 00:26:18.886]  Her husband said she should be arrested, but no, no, no.
[00:26:19.406 --> 00:26:21.788]  It's all of our collective faults.
[00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:29.475]  By the way, I went and saw this weekend Mule with the Mule with Clint Eastwood.
[00:26:29.495 --> 00:26:32.117]  And I gotta say, it's definitely one of his best movies.
[00:26:33.218 --> 00:26:36.220]  And you get to see it for yourself because it's very sophisticated.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.483]  It starts out where you think, oh my God, he really is old.
[00:26:39.703 --> 00:26:42.525]  He really is, you know,
[00:26:43.473 --> 00:26:48.395]  Looks like he's about 100 years old, but then you see that he's basically playing the part of that.
[00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:50.437]  It's very, very interesting.
[00:26:50.837 --> 00:26:53.258]  And you see him flare up into the old Clint Eastwood.
[00:26:53.518 --> 00:26:54.979]  This is a perfect swan song.
[00:26:54.999 --> 00:26:58.321]  It was eight years ago he came out with Gran Torino.
[00:26:58.901 --> 00:27:01.542]  He said he wouldn't be on camera again, but he's back.
[00:27:02.122 --> 00:27:03.663]  And I think this is probably his swan song.
[00:27:03.703 --> 00:27:06.124]  I'm predicting this will be the last film he's in.
[00:27:06.505 --> 00:27:09.026]  But I don't know, he's so good at it, maybe they'll convince him to be in more.
[00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:13.682]  But it's just such a good script, and the thing is very powerful.
[00:27:13.962 --> 00:27:18.726]  You hardly ever go to movies anymore and get really satisfied watching them, and it was just very satisfying.
[00:27:20.647 --> 00:27:22.389]  And, you know, he's a little wilder, too.
[00:27:22.729 --> 00:27:24.551]  Clint Eastwood's never done anything like this in a movie.
[00:27:28.594 --> 00:27:29.254]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[00:27:29.595 --> 00:27:31.796]  Well, he is involved in two threesomes.
[00:27:34.144 --> 00:27:34.745]  It's a Robin Hood story.
[00:27:54.281 --> 00:27:55.762]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:27:55.862 --> 00:27:58.163]  And then NBC anchors irritated.
[00:27:59.183 --> 00:28:01.064]  Federal judge ruled Obamacare unconstitutional.
[00:28:01.104 --> 00:28:02.025]  Of course it is.
[00:28:02.405 --> 00:28:05.547]  To have a mandate that you've got to buy something from a private company?
[00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:13.111]  And then the price goes up, because if you've got to buy it, the price is going to go up.
[00:28:13.151 --> 00:28:14.911]  That's coming up as well.
[00:28:15.572 --> 00:28:18.493]  The left always worships federal judges until they don't do what they want.
[00:28:18.793 --> 00:28:22.355]  And now Obama says that Trump's making law through judges.
[00:28:22.415 --> 00:28:23.536]  No, that's what the left does.
[00:28:25.057 --> 00:28:28.639]  Under a strict constructionist, any judge would throw this out.
[00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:34.081]  You can't make somebody buy a private service.
[00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:36.442]  You know, we've seen it with insurance and so many other things.
[00:28:36.502 --> 00:28:39.223]  It's a very un-American, very dangerous road to go down.
[00:28:39.603 --> 00:28:40.864]  Well, you've got to be responsible.
[00:28:41.364 --> 00:28:42.364]  There's more than one way to do that.
[00:28:42.664 --> 00:28:43.845]  Are the illegal aliens responsible?
[00:28:43.945 --> 00:28:45.826]  Oh no, they don't have to be, but citizens all do.
[00:28:47.326 --> 00:28:48.567]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:28:48.627 --> 00:28:51.128]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:53.409]  Tomorrow's news today, we are the most censored.
[00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:54.923]  Most lied about.
[00:28:55.384 --> 00:28:57.649]  Most demonized broadcast in the world for good reason.
[00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.194]  We're dropping truth bombs right over the target.
[00:29:05.274 --> 00:29:13.600]  Mark Dice, media analyst, best-selling author, billions of views on YouTube alone, is here with us for the Balance of the Hour.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:14.440]  MarkDice.com.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.042]  His new book, Liberalism, Find a Cure by Mark Dice.
[00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:18.723]  Remember those things called books?
[00:29:18.943 --> 00:29:19.203]  Get it.
[00:29:19.644 --> 00:29:19.924]  Read it.

[00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:22.346]  Donate to the library.
[00:29:22.746 --> 00:29:24.047]  It will change the world.
[00:29:24.187 --> 00:29:25.107]  Every little bit counts.
[00:29:25.227 --> 00:29:26.008]  No reviews yet.
[00:29:26.508 --> 00:29:29.090]  It's gone to, like, number one in political on Amazon.
[00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:30.491]  We got it a few weeks after.
[00:29:30.551 --> 00:29:34.033]  We now have it at InfoWareStore.com, so no reviews there, but five-star reviews.
[00:29:34.374 --> 00:29:34.894]  I've read the book.
[00:29:35.134 --> 00:29:35.614]  It's amazing.

[00:29:37.975 --> 00:29:38.195]  There is.
[00:29:38.355 --> 00:29:39.755]  I mean, it's not a joke.
[00:29:39.775 --> 00:29:40.795]  This isn't hyperbole.
[00:29:40.815 --> 00:29:45.216]  It really is some kind of a defect or a disease or a mental disorder.
[00:29:45.616 --> 00:29:56.278]  In fact, there was a documentary produced by PBS hosted by David Eagleman, which you can find on Netflix or Prime, maybe even on YouTube, where he went to a neural imaging laboratory at Virginia Tech.
[00:29:56.578 --> 00:29:59.899]  And one of the neurologists there discovered an interesting connection
[00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:14.450]  By scanning people's brains, he has determined a test that with a 95% accuracy, he can tell from an MRI or an fMRI, a functional MRI, whether or not someone is a liberal or a conservative.
[00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.251]  And so that leads many people to wonder, well,
[00:30:16.631 --> 00:30:17.452]  What's the difference?
[00:30:17.532 --> 00:30:21.674]  How can you tell from a brain scan whether someone is a left-wing or right-wing person?
[00:30:21.774 --> 00:30:23.255]  And the answer makes perfect sense.
[00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:31.801]  What he did is these people in the MRI, he showed them images of disgusting things like dead bodies and food being eaten by maggots.
[00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:40.986]  Anything that any normal person should be disgusted and repelled by just from the normal protective mechanisms that have been built into the human brain.
[00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:42.067]  And liberals
[00:30:42.387 --> 00:30:46.009]  ...do not feel the levels of disgust that normal people do.
[00:30:46.069 --> 00:30:55.654]  And in fact, the less they feel disgusted towards seeing or experiencing what normal people see as a disgusting thing, the more liberal they are.
[00:30:55.734 --> 00:30:59.796]  Which makes perfect sense because the liberals' brains are defective.
[00:31:00.076 --> 00:31:01.437]  They can't see right and wrong.
[00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:03.037]  Their consciences are seared.
[00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:07.840]  The Bible calls it the reprobate mind because they've turned themselves over to evil.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:16.484]  And now this poor neurologist at Virginia Tech's imaging laboratory is horrified really at his findings because think of the implications of this.
[00:31:16.824 --> 00:31:25.127]  He has proved that liberals have no conscience, that when they see something that should absolutely freak out a normal person, they feel nothing.
[00:31:25.167 --> 00:31:28.669]  They see nothing wrong with it because their minds are literally defective.
[00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:29.750]  Every study shows it.
[00:31:30.131 --> 00:31:32.273]  Nine times more likely in British and U.S.
[00:31:32.293 --> 00:31:32.573]  studies.
[00:31:32.633 --> 00:31:33.354]  Showed the same thing.
[00:31:33.394 --> 00:31:34.035]  Major universities.
[00:31:34.335 --> 00:31:35.477]  Liberals did this.
[00:31:35.817 --> 00:31:41.483]  They found that, quote, liberals, really leftists, are more likely to virtue signal but not actually give to charity.
[00:31:41.544 --> 00:31:43.165]  Nine times less likely to give to charity.
[00:31:43.766 --> 00:31:45.227]  Six times more likely to steal.
[00:31:45.327 --> 00:31:48.410]  They found it in Russia, in Japan, in the United States.
[00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:57.257]  So what they are is they're sociopaths that have no moral compass, but they know we have them, so they project it out because that gets power over us.
[00:31:57.457 --> 00:32:01.500]  And so what you're saying is absolutely true, that they actually like disgusting things.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.223]  They like two-year-olds being taught they're really a girl or a boy and being screwed up.
[00:32:05.663 --> 00:32:14.758]  They like child pornography as vice and the New York Times and all these other things promote.
[00:32:14.998 --> 00:32:16.440]  These really are evil people.
[00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:18.804]  The new book is at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:19.932 --> 00:32:20.793]  Needs to be a bestseller.
[00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:22.914]  In fact, I know it was number one political book.
[00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.035]  What did it go to on Amazon?
[00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:25.296]  Liberalism, find a care market.
[00:32:26.056 --> 00:32:30.320]  It was number 15 on Amazon.com out of all books.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.021]  Not just a specific category.
[00:32:32.041 --> 00:32:33.302]  The day that it came out.
[00:32:33.322 --> 00:32:34.983]  Unprecedented.
[00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:39.866]  Interestingly, the same ceiling that my last book, The True Story of Fake News, hit as well.
[00:32:40.087 --> 00:32:41.748]  And that's with no reviews.
[00:32:42.368 --> 00:32:43.909]  Oh, it's like the stock market.
[00:32:43.949 --> 00:32:45.550]  It's got all these pre-placed computer deals.
[00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:47.231]  The point is, everybody should get the book.
[00:32:47.251 --> 00:32:48.392]  Great job, people that did.
[00:32:48.712 --> 00:32:49.693]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:32:50.013 --> 00:32:51.094]  Liberalism, find a cure.
[00:32:51.254 --> 00:32:58.338]  Give it to members of your family that are on the fence and say, listen, it may not be too late for you, but you really want to be part of this at Infowarstore.com.
[00:33:06.003 --> 00:33:08.625]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:31.781 --> 00:33:35.365]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:35.385 --> 00:33:38.368]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.508 --> 00:33:53.063]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better fight!
[00:33:57.011 --> 00:34:02.556]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:19.332]  Ramin Parsa is our guest till the end of the hour.
[00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:22.876]  We see these news headlines from Europe.
[00:34:24.269 --> 00:34:34.918]  Where if a Swede or a German or a Christian or anybody complains about being physically assaulted, anything, they get arrested.
[00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:43.966]  And we see judges ruling in Sweden and other areas that the Islamists that have brought in are allowed to even rape women.
[00:34:44.006 --> 00:34:46.228]  They say, well, we're not going to give them any present time.
[00:34:46.248 --> 00:34:47.249]  They're learning our culture.
[00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:50.391]  And it's the leftist feminists that are bringing them in.
[00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:51.973]  Why is that in my view?
[00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:55.685]  It's because it will clash with Christianity.
[00:34:56.385 --> 00:34:57.746]  It will create a divided culture.
[00:34:58.486 --> 00:35:07.889]  But now, more and more, we see the UK and others announcing, if you even criticize Islam, you will be arrested.
[00:35:09.169 --> 00:35:17.072]  And then you have the big famous case of the woman who was given the death penalty in Pakistan for being a Christian, and then that was commuted, but now she has a fatwa out, they're trying to kill her.
[00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:19.013]  She's asked for asylum in the UK.
[00:35:20.467 --> 00:35:22.869]  Theresa May said no, it would offend Muslims.
[00:35:24.171 --> 00:35:30.056]  So there is a leftist move all over the world that if you offend Muslims in any way, you get arrested.
[00:35:30.577 --> 00:35:34.480]  And that includes if you're a Christian and you try to talk to them about Christianity.
[00:35:35.842 --> 00:35:40.046]  So we are adopting their Sharia law.
[00:35:41.209 --> 00:35:43.831]  And they're even pushing that in places like Europe.
[00:35:44.152 --> 00:35:53.820]  There's the headline, Theresa May block asylum application for Pakistani Christian locked up for blasphemy despite UK playing host to hijackers, extremists, and rapists.
[00:35:54.561 --> 00:35:59.646]  Yes, they give free council estates, that's houses, to returning ISIS fighters.
[00:36:00.146 --> 00:36:03.990]  So, we're joined by our guest.
[00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.851]  Here's the headline.
[00:36:08.052 --> 00:36:18.305]  Pending for ex-Muslim Christian pastor arrested for sharing his testimony in Minnesota at the Mosque of America, formerly known as the Mall of America.
[00:36:22.756 --> 00:36:26.997]  He was born into a very large Shiite Muslim family shortly after the Iranian Revolution.
[00:36:27.438 --> 00:36:29.858]  His family was greatly impacted by the revolution.
[00:36:29.878 --> 00:36:30.899]  One of his brothers was killed.
[00:36:31.519 --> 00:36:32.959]  Most of his family possessions were taken.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:37.661]  He was raised learning Islamic laws and made to practice strict religious traditions.
[00:36:38.241 --> 00:36:43.183]  He was tortured multiple times under suspicion of violating these strict religious laws and traditions.
[00:36:43.743 --> 00:36:47.024]  When his father died of a heart attack, he began to question his faith in Islam.
[00:36:47.544 --> 00:36:50.365]  He had no hope or purpose in life and became suicidal.
[00:36:51.596 --> 00:36:55.359]  At this time, he heard the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ for the first time.
[00:36:55.739 --> 00:36:57.461]  At first, he disagreed with what he was hearing.
[00:36:57.821 --> 00:37:02.685]  But later, upon asking Jesus to come into his heart, he felt the power of salvation come upon him.
[00:37:03.685 --> 00:37:06.848]  He fled Iran, ended up in Oklahoma, serving a local ministry.
[00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:19.358]  After graduating a small Bible college in 2011, he went to California, where he currently serves the Lord by preaching and training new disciples through a local church, television, and the Internet.

[00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:30.821]  And it's good to have you on, Ramin.
[00:37:30.862 --> 00:37:31.602]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:33.565]  Thank you.
[00:37:33.745 --> 00:37:34.886]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[00:37:35.106 --> 00:37:36.948]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[00:37:36.988 --> 00:37:40.452]  Tell us what happened to you while you were in Minnesota, Minneapolis-St.
[00:37:40.492 --> 00:37:42.675]  Paul, Mall of America, and what unfolded.
[00:37:44.264 --> 00:37:48.626]  Well, I was, in fact, a few weeks prior to that, I was in Mexico.
[00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:49.987]  I was preaching the Gospel.
[00:37:50.147 --> 00:37:59.471]  I was invited to speak in Mexico because I was told that many young men and women are turning to atheism because they're disappointed with Catholicism.
[00:37:59.791 --> 00:38:06.334]  So I went there and I shared my testimony at a few youth camps, at a university, and a few churches.
[00:38:06.414 --> 00:38:07.455]  And it was very powerful.
[00:38:08.035 --> 00:38:11.077]  And on the way back, our plane crashed.
[00:38:12.097 --> 00:38:17.519]  I cried out to Jesus and I called on his name and the Lord saved me and 102 other passengers.
[00:38:17.979 --> 00:38:18.679]  Nobody died.
[00:38:19.399 --> 00:38:30.582]  The plane burned to the ground and three weeks later I was in Minnesota and I was greeted with a handcuff at the Mall of America because I was speaking in Minnesota.
[00:38:30.663 --> 00:38:32.163]  It was my first time in that state.
[00:38:33.264 --> 00:38:39.146]  I was there upon the invitation of a pastor who invited me actually a year prior to that.
[00:38:39.306 --> 00:38:42.908]  And I went there to speak at the church after the church service.
[00:38:42.988 --> 00:38:48.389]  One of the elders and his 14-year-old son offered to show me the city and the mall.
[00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.871]  And they said, we're going to show you the biggest mall in North America.
[00:38:51.931 --> 00:38:52.591]  And I went there.
[00:38:53.371 --> 00:38:58.153]  We had no plan to go evangelize or advertise or solicit, as they call it.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.123]  I was there in the mall, and I just ran into some Somali Muslims.
[00:39:02.143 --> 00:39:04.445]  We had a private, you know, casual conversation.
[00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:06.727]  You know, we asked each other, where are you from?
[00:39:06.767 --> 00:39:11.110]  And I told them, I'm originally from Iran, and they asked me if I'm a Muslim.
[00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:12.011]  I said, I used to be.
[00:39:12.051 --> 00:39:12.752]  I'm a Christian now.
[00:39:13.579 --> 00:39:14.380]  And I said, why?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.240]  Why did you change?
[00:39:15.881 --> 00:39:31.611]  And as I began to explain to them, you know, my testimony, how and why I became a Christian, another Muslim lady who was not a part of the conversation, she overheard us and she went and told the guard that this guy is harassing us and this guy is, you know, attacking us.
[00:39:31.651 --> 00:39:34.714]  And then the guard came and he said, you cannot do this here.
[00:39:34.754 --> 00:39:35.354]  It's illegal.
[00:39:35.374 --> 00:39:36.355]  You cannot solicit here.
[00:39:36.395 --> 00:39:37.976]  I said, well, I'm not soliciting.
[00:39:38.496 --> 00:39:42.539]  Even those two ladies who were listening to me, they said, we want to hear why you changed.
[00:39:43.099 --> 00:39:46.862]  And they got into an argument with each other and we just said goodbye and we walked away.
[00:39:46.882 --> 00:39:48.002]  We didn't want to make any problem.
[00:39:48.463 --> 00:39:50.444]  We walked away and went to a coffee shop.
[00:39:50.484 --> 00:39:56.408]  We got some coffee and when we got out of the coffee shop, three guards were waiting for me.
[00:39:56.968 --> 00:39:58.549]  And they asked me to leave immediately.
[00:39:58.609 --> 00:39:59.229]  I said, why?
[00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:01.371]  They said, because you are soliciting.
[00:40:01.411 --> 00:40:02.431]  I said, no, I'm not.
[00:40:02.552 --> 00:40:05.293]  And I began to explain to them why I'm here.
[00:40:05.353 --> 00:40:06.414]  I said, I'm a guest here.
[00:40:06.554 --> 00:40:07.735]  I'm speaking at a church.
[00:40:08.315 --> 00:40:17.368]  I just came to see the mall and as I was explaining to them, they arrested me, they handcuffed me from behind and they took me to a mall jail on the ground.
[00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:18.330]  It was a basement.
[00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.014]  They took me to the basement and they handcuffed both my hands.
[00:40:21.716 --> 00:40:24.078]  Unfortunately, this is becoming far too common.
[00:40:24.098 --> 00:40:25.940]  I'm sure you heard my introduction.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.101]  You can see it in the news every day.
[00:40:50.953 --> 00:40:54.475]  If you even criticize Islam online, you get arrested.
[00:40:54.495 --> 00:41:02.099]  Now Facebook's talking about banning basically all French rural people from having access, because they said, quote, that started the Yellow Vest Movement.
[00:41:02.499 --> 00:41:13.265]  There's this crackdown on free speech, and when Islam comes in, it doesn't put up with anybody preaching Christianity, as you know, in Iran, or in Saudi Arabia, or anywhere else for that matter.
[00:41:14.355 --> 00:41:24.097]  And so to have you doing that basically in a mall that most of the time is over half Muslim, that's basically like you being in a mosque doing that, even though it's a public space.
[00:41:24.557 --> 00:41:32.199]  And so that's seen as disorderly conduct, you see, because your free speech that Americans have doesn't comport with Islam.
[00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:37.700]  So we're adopting the most radical forms of that, not just here, but all over the Western world.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.440]  Very, very frightening.
[00:41:39.571 --> 00:41:56.801]  Absolutely, this is becoming common and it's just amazing that a few weeks prior to my arrest, Mall of America had a celebration for the Islamic feast and Islamic holiday and yet I'm there as a citizen, U.S.
[00:41:56.861 --> 00:42:00.704]  citizen, I am in the mall and I am exercising my first amendment right.
[00:42:00.724 --> 00:42:02.485]  I'm talking in a private conversation.
[00:42:02.905 --> 00:42:03.846]  I was not screaming.
[00:42:03.906 --> 00:42:06.187]  I was not passing any flyers.
[00:42:06.287 --> 00:42:10.909]  I was not... I was just talking in a private conversation and I was interrupted.
[00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:13.830]  I was told not to do that and I stopped doing it.
[00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.091]  I walked to the coffee shop and we walked away.
[00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:19.152]  But they came after us and it is true.
[00:42:19.653 --> 00:42:20.973]  I fled the persecution.
[00:42:21.013 --> 00:42:24.475]  I fled Iran because Sharia law is in full practice there.
[00:42:25.055 --> 00:42:29.076]  And 40 years ago, liberals and Islamists, they clued up with each other.
[00:42:29.916 --> 00:42:31.097]  They demonized the Shah.
[00:42:31.637 --> 00:42:35.698]  And the college campuses, universities, they began to protest and demonize the Shah.
[00:42:35.818 --> 00:42:37.599]  And then a revolution took place.
[00:42:38.419 --> 00:42:43.960]  40 years later, Iranians have no right even to say whatever they want to.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.181]  They have no right to believe what they want to.
[00:42:46.921 --> 00:42:48.342]  So this is Sharia in practice.
[00:42:48.422 --> 00:42:50.022]  And I was born and raised a Muslim.
[00:42:50.462 --> 00:42:53.483]  I was taught Islam for 19 years every day of my life.
[00:42:53.983 --> 00:42:59.434]  And Islam is the darkest and the most evil ideology that has ever existed in human history.
[00:42:59.534 --> 00:43:00.316]  Rahim, stay right there.
[00:43:00.336 --> 00:43:01.678]  We're going to come back and talk about this.
[00:43:03.154 --> 00:43:13.902]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history because Soros and the Globalists are all over the news trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut down our shopping carts, trying to destroy us.
[00:43:14.502 --> 00:43:17.905]  They have kicked us off almost every media outlet out there because we're loyal Americans.
[00:43:17.945 --> 00:43:30.114]  But thanks to you supporting us, we're on more radio stations and more TV stations than ever because these stations understand that Trump and myself and many others are being persecuted by the Globalists, by the leftists, by the Hollywood scum.
[00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.651]  But InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:43:32.711 --> 00:43:40.413]  So this Christmas, with only a few days until Christmas left, I wanted to just thank all the viewers and listeners for your support, for your prayers, and for being in this together.
[00:43:40.573 --> 00:43:49.897]  And just to remind you again, please share the articles, please share the videos from NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, because those get around the censors easier than InfoWars.com.
[00:43:50.157 --> 00:43:55.699]  But whatever you do, realize this country and this planet is in a fight for its life against the globalists and
[00:43:56.799 --> 00:44:09.544]  It is financing that allows us to do what we do, and that's why it is a total win for everybody, because you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, and at the same time, you help fund this operation that is fearlessly fighting the globalists as hard as we can.
[00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:14.085]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[00:44:14.606 --> 00:44:23.249]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas.
[00:44:24.009 --> 00:44:24.730]  We're good to go!
[00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:53.011]  And thank you again, all, for your support.
[00:44:53.311 --> 00:44:55.493]  We're extending this sale until the 19th.
[00:44:56.033 --> 00:45:00.617]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the globalists together.
[00:45:00.677 --> 00:45:00.997]  Thank you.
[00:45:02.738 --> 00:45:09.204]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:45:10.905 --> 00:45:12.346]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:17.531]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50 to 75% off double Patriot points.
[00:45:18.678 --> 00:45:24.627]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[00:45:25.388 --> 00:45:31.477]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free coiled silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale.
[00:45:31.857 --> 00:45:33.059]  You'll get a free gift
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:59.982]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[00:46:01.215 --> 00:46:07.540]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.741]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[00:46:09.801 --> 00:46:14.745]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[00:46:15.205 --> 00:46:15.726]  It's big.
[00:46:16.246 --> 00:46:16.686]  It's bad.
[00:46:17.087 --> 00:46:22.310]  So, we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.632]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[00:46:25.072 --> 00:46:28.275]  So, to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:29.817]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:46:29.857 --> 00:46:31.039]  That's been going on for over a month.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.023]  50 to 75% off.
[00:46:33.043 --> 00:46:34.064]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[00:46:35.128 --> 00:46:36.069]  The Double Patriot points.
[00:46:36.089 --> 00:46:36.990]  That's what happened in about a week.
[00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:43.976]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[00:46:44.436 --> 00:46:48.640]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:50.742]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:46:51.002 --> 00:46:52.804]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:46:53.004 --> 00:46:55.366]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:55.566 --> 00:46:59.230]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[00:47:06.946 --> 00:47:09.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:20.974]  Have yourself a merry little Christmas.
[00:47:22.135 --> 00:47:27.318]  Let your heart be light.
[00:47:28.498 --> 00:47:36.783]  Next year all our troubles will be out of sight.
[00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:51.895]  We cover the frightening, we cover the dangerous, we cover the scary things here because we don't believe you're cowards.
[00:47:53.596 --> 00:47:56.999]  We think you have strength and courage and you want to know about the threat and face it.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.106]  And I think with the global awakening, the reassurgence of Christianity, the reassurgence of free market ideas and Western culture, I think I bet on the right horse.
[00:48:06.407 --> 00:48:07.628]  At least that horse is in the running.
[00:48:09.289 --> 00:48:10.050]  Now if you just joined us,
[00:48:11.943 --> 00:48:14.704]  Ramin Parsa grew up in Iran.
[00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:19.485]  He was a Christian, he was a Muslim, but then he became a Christian.
[00:48:20.085 --> 00:48:25.346]  So again, if you just joined us, Ramin Parsa grew up in Iran.
[00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:27.006]  He was a Shiite Muslim.
[00:48:27.867 --> 00:48:33.888]  He saw the persecutions, saw the horrible things that happened, became a Christian, and now he teaches the gospel.
[00:48:34.388 --> 00:48:38.349]  He was just visiting friends, invited to Minnesota, went to the Mall of America,
[00:48:39.565 --> 00:48:41.545]  They were having one of their big Islamic events there.
[00:48:41.565 --> 00:48:42.366]  They have them constantly.
[00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:44.186]  I'm going to show some footage for TV viewers.
[00:48:44.886 --> 00:48:45.506]  They come over.
[00:48:45.826 --> 00:48:46.607]  People talk to him.
[00:48:47.807 --> 00:48:49.727]  He says, I was a Muslim, but I'm a Christian now.
[00:48:49.747 --> 00:48:53.088]  Well, that's a big crime under Islam to be a Muslim and then become a Christian.
[00:48:53.108 --> 00:48:54.868]  That's punishable by death in Iran.
[00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:56.349]  Death in Saudi Arabia.
[00:48:56.869 --> 00:48:58.149]  So this is obviously upsetting.
[00:48:58.209 --> 00:48:59.929]  Well, you've brought in an incompatible group.
[00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:05.751]  So now, instead of making them assimilate, no, no, we can't do this show.
[00:49:06.071 --> 00:49:07.231]  He's warned by one guard.
[00:49:08.885 --> 00:49:09.305]  Don't do it.
[00:49:09.325 --> 00:49:10.186]  He goes, I'm not.
[00:49:10.366 --> 00:49:11.146]  He goes and has coffee.
[00:49:11.546 --> 00:49:12.486]  Three guards follow him.
[00:49:12.887 --> 00:49:13.387]  They take him.
[00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:16.228]  Recap for everybody because obviously it happened to you.
[00:49:16.248 --> 00:49:17.068]  You tell it best.
[00:49:17.088 --> 00:49:19.969]  And the fact that they're going ahead with the prosecution here.
[00:49:19.989 --> 00:49:21.630]  You're facing jail time.
[00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:23.071]  And that's the headline.
[00:49:23.111 --> 00:49:23.931]  It breaks it all down.
[00:49:24.251 --> 00:49:28.933]  Trial pending for ex-Muslim Christian pastor arrested for sharing his testimony in Minnesota.
[00:49:29.293 --> 00:49:29.953]  It's come here.
[00:49:30.033 --> 00:49:34.315]  So recap what you told us and then get into the other information.
[00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:36.236]  It's just amazingly evil.
[00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:43.211]  Yes, as I said, you know, I was invited to speak at a church there in Minnesota, and I went there to speak at a church.
[00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:46.292]  After the church, I went to the mall, just to see the mall.
[00:49:46.512 --> 00:49:52.133]  And as I was visiting the mall, we ran into some Somali Muslims.
[00:49:52.193 --> 00:49:52.853]  They came to us.
[00:49:52.893 --> 00:49:55.533]  We talked and had a conversation, a private conversation.
[00:49:56.953 --> 00:49:59.274]  And then it led to, you know, they asked me if I'm a Muslim.
[00:49:59.354 --> 00:50:00.414]  I said, I used to be.
[00:50:00.534 --> 00:50:01.334]  I'm a Christian now.
[00:50:01.814 --> 00:50:02.775]  And they asked me, why?
[00:50:02.855 --> 00:50:03.935]  Why did you become a Christian?
[00:50:03.975 --> 00:50:05.155]  And I was explaining to them,
[00:50:05.774 --> 00:50:15.702]  Giving them my testimony and then that's one of the, another Muslim lady who was not a part of the conversation, she went and told the guard that this guy is harassing us and whatever.
[00:50:16.062 --> 00:50:20.886]  And then the guard came and he said, hey you guys cannot do this, this is, you know, you cannot solicit here.
[00:50:21.126 --> 00:50:23.047]  And I said, no, no, I'm not soliciting here.
[00:50:23.588 --> 00:50:29.953]  And even the two ladies were listening to me, they were arguing with that lady that hey, we want to hear what happened with this guy, why he changed.
[00:50:30.553 --> 00:50:34.214]  And then we just, you know, we saw it becoming a big motion and we just walked away.
[00:50:34.554 --> 00:50:37.215]  We said goodbye, went to a coffee shop and got some coffee.
[00:50:37.795 --> 00:50:40.776]  And when we came out, three guards were waiting for me.
[00:50:40.916 --> 00:50:43.037]  And then that's when they arrested me.
[00:50:43.437 --> 00:50:46.398]  They handcuffed me and then they took me to a basement in the mall.
[00:50:47.158 --> 00:50:52.060]  And they handcuffed both my hands to a metal chair, bolted to the ground.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.860]  And I told them, I'm a pastor.
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.761]  I'm here to speak at a church.
[00:50:55.841 --> 00:50:57.641]  I'm visiting in the state.
[00:50:57.701 --> 00:50:59.422]  They said, oh, we arrested pastors before.
[00:51:00.362 --> 00:51:03.903]  And so it was so sad to see that such a thing happened in America, you know.
[00:51:04.263 --> 00:51:05.064]  Who could imagine?
[00:51:05.104 --> 00:51:14.967]  Who could imagine that America, which is the beacon of freedom, one day be a place where you, as a Christian, cannot even express yourself or be arrested for sharing your faith publicly?
[00:51:15.067 --> 00:51:24.630]  And this is just a disgrace to what's happening to this country, especially in states where liberals are ruling it and to Minnesota, Michigan.
[00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.471]  And it's so sad to see that this is happening to America.
[00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:29.112]  Well, here's another example.
[00:51:29.132 --> 00:51:30.233]  I mean, there's thousands of these.
[00:51:30.713 --> 00:51:33.256]  The UN admits that the persecution of Christians has doubled.
[00:51:33.336 --> 00:51:34.817]  We're the most persecuted group in the world.
[00:51:35.458 --> 00:51:39.782]  Some years, it's over a million are murdered, almost exclusively by the hands of Islamists.
[00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:43.726]  And as you pointed out earlier, obviously living there, I studied the history.
[00:51:44.086 --> 00:51:45.247]  You had Mohammed Mozadek.
[00:51:46.088 --> 00:51:52.815]  Uh, and then, you know, obviously, uh, that was a coalition of Islamists and, and, and foreigners that helped overthrow him.
[00:51:52.835 --> 00:51:54.677]  Then they got knocked out and the Shah came in.
[00:51:55.017 --> 00:51:56.699]  He was actually industrializing the nation.
[00:51:57.039 --> 00:52:02.845]  Then the CIA double-crossed him, brought in the Ayatollah Khomeini, and then he worked with leftists.
[00:52:03.525 --> 00:52:13.097]  To overthrow the Shah, that's a historical fact, and then the Islamists, the Shiite Jihadists, they then double-crossed the left and exterminated hundreds of thousands of them.
[00:52:13.117 --> 00:52:18.343]  I mean, this is unbelievable how the left always has this alliance with radical Islam.
[00:52:18.383 --> 00:52:19.885]  Can you speak from personal experience of that?
[00:52:20.954 --> 00:52:22.215]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:52:22.255 --> 00:52:33.283]  You know, 40 years ago, the Islamists and the liberals, the leftists, the communists in Iran, what they did, they slew each other, they demonized the Shah.
[00:52:33.763 --> 00:52:37.445]  It began from the schools and universities and college campuses.
[00:52:37.465 --> 00:52:39.947]  You know, it sounds familiar, what we see in America today.
[00:52:40.448 --> 00:52:43.750]  And they began to demonize the Shah, that the Shah is a puppet from America.
[00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:45.030]  And so forth.
[00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:48.351]  So they eventually led to a revolution and they kicked the Shah out.
[00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:54.232]  And Iran, which was one of the leading economies in the world, was one of the major powers in the world.
[00:52:54.633 --> 00:52:58.033]  And today is the poorest country, one of the poorest countries in the world.
[00:52:58.373 --> 00:53:00.634]  Although it has a lot of oil and is a wealthy country.
[00:53:01.054 --> 00:53:04.455]  But the Islamists and the liberals destroyed that country.
[00:53:04.975 --> 00:53:08.776]  And Sharia law, which was a theory prior to that, it became practical.
[00:53:09.256 --> 00:53:15.932]  You know, when I was 11 years old, as I was walking on the street to go to school, I saw people being executed publicly in front of my eyes.
[00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:18.220]  I saw people hanging from cranes.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:25.263]  I saw people beyond the, you know, they put people on the bed and they whip them with a whip, with a cable, electric cable.
[00:53:25.524 --> 00:53:26.624]  They would beat these people.
[00:53:27.084 --> 00:53:33.468]  And after they told me these are the infidels, these are the mushreiks, these are the enemies of Allah and they deserve that.
[00:53:33.928 --> 00:53:39.651]  Until when I was 16 years old, I was arrested myself and I was beaten, tortured by the Islamic Sharia Law Police.
[00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:47.778]  And that's when I began to question Islam and shortly after that my father passed away and that's when I began to doubt Islam.
[00:53:47.818 --> 00:54:01.129]  I began to do a deep study in Islam and I saw so much darkness in Quran and in Islamic studies and I lost my faith in Islam but at the same time I couldn't deny the fact that there's a God and I was crying out to God, who are you?
[00:54:01.209 --> 00:54:02.110]  Why did you create me?
[00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:05.773]  And that's when I heard the glorious gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[00:54:06.133 --> 00:54:10.918]  That's when he saved my life, and ever since I've been serving the Lord, I get invitations.
[00:54:10.998 --> 00:54:12.260]  I just came back from Thailand.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:21.269]  I was on a mission trip and sharing the Gospels in the mountains with the Buddhist people who are open, and they invited me to share with them the good news of the Gospel.
[00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:24.933]  But in America, you get arrested for doing that in the Mall of America.
[00:54:25.493 --> 00:54:27.334]  Even though it was a private conversation.
[00:54:27.414 --> 00:54:31.677]  So Sharia law is a dangerous thing and I warn the American people.
[00:54:31.697 --> 00:54:37.600]  I warn the Western civilization that Sharia law and Islam is an enemy to the Western civilization.
[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.561]  This is happening.
[00:54:38.961 --> 00:54:40.762]  This is not something that is happening recently.
[00:54:41.297 --> 00:54:43.019]  This has been happening for centuries.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:47.504]  You know, crusades for which the leftists are blaming Christians for.
[00:54:47.825 --> 00:54:52.971]  Crusades were nothing but a defense against Islamic assault against the West.
[00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:58.938]  The Islamists were trying to take over the West and the Europeans began to fight against them and push them back.
[00:54:59.598 --> 00:55:03.760]  And today the leftists are blaming Christians for Crusade and the Holocaust.
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:04.721]  Did you know the Holocaust?
[00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:09.643]  Islamists are responsible for Holocaust and all these things that they're blaming the Christians for.
[00:55:10.584 --> 00:55:19.448]  The Mufti of Jerusalem, you know, he was the one who basically urged Hitler to kill the Jews because he said if you kick them out they will come to Israel, they will come to Jerusalem.
[00:55:21.269 --> 00:55:25.413]  So what happened was that's when Hitler made the final solution.
[00:55:25.474 --> 00:55:28.657]  In his final solution, he decided to exterminate the Jews.
[00:55:29.037 --> 00:55:32.761]  So Islam has been responsible for the death of millions and millions of people.
[00:55:33.021 --> 00:55:38.047]  Well, let's expand on that because obviously Constantinople is now Istanbul.
[00:55:38.907 --> 00:55:49.116]  It is a fact that the Muslims 1400 years ago began their assaults and the Hindus and the Buddhists will tell you over 140 million Hindus over 100 million Buddhists killed by Islam which was never there.
[00:55:49.216 --> 00:55:53.940]  It invaded and it's all the way out in the Far East now as far as you name it.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.523]  All the way out in the Pacific Ocean in invasion ships you name it.
[00:55:57.623 --> 00:55:58.544]  This is the fact.
[00:55:59.364 --> 00:56:06.888]  And they had to arrest you because the Muslims were going to attack you because you were a former Muslim when they asked you, hey, who are you?
[00:56:06.928 --> 00:56:07.748]  What group are you with?
[00:56:07.768 --> 00:56:09.049]  Because you weren't Somali, obviously.
[00:56:09.409 --> 00:56:10.770]  You say, hey, I'm from Iran.
[00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:11.510]  I'm a Christian now.
[00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:13.451]  Well, they said you're bad.
[00:56:13.911 --> 00:56:16.613]  And so you had to go because there's no countries.
[00:56:17.864 --> 00:56:19.205]  That are Muslim and Christian.
[00:56:19.225 --> 00:56:20.426]  There's only Muslim countries.
[00:56:20.766 --> 00:56:28.273]  It's only Christian countries that let anybody do what they want as part of our Western ethos and you've experienced that and I appreciate your courage.
[00:56:28.773 --> 00:56:32.837]  How do people get in contact with you or invite you to their church or have you on their show?
[00:56:32.857 --> 00:56:36.500]  Do they go to R-A-M-I-N-P-A-R-S-A dot org?
[00:56:38.578 --> 00:56:41.261]  My name is Ramin at RaminParsa.org.
[00:56:41.641 --> 00:56:45.645]  I also have written a book, it's called From Ashes to Glory, right here.
[00:56:46.045 --> 00:56:53.613]  And in the book I explain my own personal testimony and also I share, I talk about the danger of Islam, the mission of Islam.
[00:56:54.053 --> 00:56:56.155]  I talk about Islamic Sharia Law, Jihad.
[00:56:56.415 --> 00:56:57.837]  Well sir, you're very, very impressive.
[00:56:57.857 --> 00:56:58.537]  We're out of time.
[00:56:58.818 --> 00:57:00.719]  Come back in the near future for a full hour, okay?
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.181]  Sure, definitely.
[00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:03.182]  Thank you so much for having me.
[00:57:03.925 --> 00:57:04.586]  Have a great Christmas.
[00:57:04.626 --> 00:57:05.126]  God bless you.
[00:57:05.286 --> 00:57:06.207]  All right, we're going to come back.
[00:57:06.227 --> 00:57:08.108]  Another big guest, Gerald Cilente, joining us.
[00:57:08.128 --> 00:57:09.109]  We'll have open phones as well.
[00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:11.711]  Please, don't forget, Christmas is almost here.
[00:57:12.131 --> 00:57:16.894]  If you get your order in by the 19th, it's guaranteed to come before Christmas in the continental United States.
[00:57:17.355 --> 00:57:18.175]  Don't fight the crowds.
[00:57:18.215 --> 00:57:19.736]  Don't fight the traffic.
[00:57:20.097 --> 00:57:21.017]  And get great products.
[00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:22.378]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.

[00:57:23.639 --> 00:57:24.300]  50 to 75% off.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.161]  We've never had sales this big.
[00:57:26.361 --> 00:57:27.602]  It's a year-end clearance sale.
[00:57:28.142 --> 00:57:29.183]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:29.223 --> 00:57:29.824]  Oh, and I forgot!

[00:57:37.569 --> 00:57:38.049]  Everything.

[00:57:53.397 --> 00:57:55.918]  2018 has come and it's almost gone.
[00:57:55.938 --> 00:57:58.618]  And it's been one incredible year.
[00:57:58.658 --> 00:57:59.878]  It's been a serious fight.
[00:58:00.419 --> 00:58:04.720]  But nationalism and populism and Christianity are coming back across the world.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:09.040]  Thanks to God shining through you and your family.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.941]  Thanks to you taking action.
[00:58:10.961 --> 00:58:14.162]  So I want to thank you for what you've done.
[00:58:14.922 --> 00:58:19.523]  You are literally the strength, the blood, the guts, the wind in our sails.
[00:58:19.923 --> 00:58:20.263]  Literally.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:23.141]  So I want to salute you and thank you for what you've done.

[00:59:27.971 --> 00:59:30.131]  And the Christ rule, lay down your life for others.
[00:59:31.032 --> 00:59:32.272]  Is that the world you want to live in?
[00:59:32.732 --> 00:59:33.713]  With a bunch of heroes?
[00:59:33.733 --> 00:59:35.493]  People that are ready to fight and stand up?
[00:59:35.533 --> 00:59:36.794]  So a bunch of backstabbing cowards?
[00:59:37.554 --> 00:59:39.414]  That's the world that builds civilization.
[00:59:39.454 --> 00:59:40.675]  That's the world that builds it all.
[00:59:40.995 --> 00:59:45.356]  So when I treat you like I want to be treated, it's because I respect myself and I respect you.
[00:59:45.836 --> 00:59:46.797]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:59:47.057 --> 00:59:47.757]  Biggest sales ever.
[00:59:47.797 --> 00:59:50.017]  Free shipping storewide, and so much more.
[00:59:50.037 --> 00:59:50.898]  But it's your last chance.
[00:59:50.918 --> 00:59:51.478]  Please take action.
[00:59:54.662 --> 00:59:58.764]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.285 --> 01:00:00.605]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:20.137 --> 01:00:21.878]  I just had a guest on and he just joined us.
[01:00:23.226 --> 01:00:26.708]  Who, is a Islamic convert to Christianity.
[01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:31.531]  And he just, and it's on record, even local governments saying this guy shouldn't be indicted.
[01:00:32.072 --> 01:00:34.493]  He's just talking to some Muslims, they're talking to him, they say don't talk to him.
[01:00:35.013 --> 01:00:37.075]  He does it, and then the police still go ahead and arrest him.
[01:00:37.535 --> 01:00:39.276]  At the Mall of America, they're going in with charges.
[01:00:39.756 --> 01:00:41.918]  And that's the thing, you can't go to any Islamic country.
[01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:46.873]  Except maybe like Morocco, that's more Western, or a few others like Jordan.
[01:00:47.613 --> 01:00:53.498]  And even be a Christian and walk around and not get in some serious trouble, if you preach the gospel, you get killed.
[01:00:54.518 --> 01:01:04.266]  And so that's my point, is we're bringing in cultures that are monotheistic, monocultures that are very strict and do not let anything outside of that come in.
[01:01:04.546 --> 01:01:07.428]  And that tends to make them get more and more orthodox, more and more radical.
[01:01:09.747 --> 01:01:11.748]  And so, look, the Amish, they're great people.
[01:01:11.888 --> 01:01:13.589]  I'm not Amish because that's too radical for me.
[01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:18.652]  Imagine, though, if the Amish moved into your town and tried to make you live like them.
[01:01:18.852 --> 01:01:19.752]  Well, they wouldn't do that.
[01:01:21.013 --> 01:01:21.593]  They're Christians.
[01:01:22.774 --> 01:01:24.334]  But the Islamists, they are.
[01:01:25.555 --> 01:01:27.336]  And they're teaching it in schools all over Europe.
[01:01:27.376 --> 01:01:28.156]  Now they're teaching it here.
[01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:30.017]  There is a formula.
[01:01:30.918 --> 01:01:32.238]  Using our open society to destroy it.
[01:01:32.258 --> 01:01:36.921]  And since we did this video a couple years ago, and it went viral with more than 50 million views online, different platforms,
[01:01:38.439 --> 01:01:41.361]  It's a Bon Iver song that they did to My Spoken Word.
[01:01:42.121 --> 01:01:42.742]  This is our version.
[01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:43.802]  We had a documentation.
[01:01:44.683 --> 01:01:50.827]  There's cases all the time of Somalis who are particularly violent, killing Christians and people just because they're Christian.
[01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:52.128]  So here is the report.
[01:01:52.488 --> 01:01:54.309]  We love our Somalis.
[01:01:54.649 --> 01:01:56.270]  We love our Muslims too.
[01:01:56.811 --> 01:01:57.851]  Oh, they're so good.
[01:01:58.232 --> 01:01:59.072]  Oh, they're so sweet.
[01:02:00.913 --> 01:02:02.394]  I'm angry.
[01:02:03.855 --> 01:02:06.497]  I've had enough of these people.
[01:02:07.384 --> 01:02:15.531]  They're a bunch of Christian murderous scum that run giant death factories keeping babies alive and selling their body parts.
[01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:18.393]  What more do you need to know about these people?
[01:02:18.513 --> 01:02:22.216]  I go out and face these scum.
[01:02:22.517 --> 01:02:24.899]  They literally crawl out from under us.
[01:02:25.319 --> 01:02:32.125]  They have green looking skin and they run around screaming, we love Satan, we wanna eat babies.
[01:02:34.085 --> 01:02:35.846]  I have them on video!
[01:02:36.206 --> 01:02:38.508]  I f***ing love Satan, so f*** you!
[01:02:38.608 --> 01:02:39.468]  I kill my kids!
[01:02:40.029 --> 01:02:43.391]  Hillary's in the creepy, weird, sick stuff, man.
[01:02:43.851 --> 01:02:46.453]  We came, we saw, he died.
[01:02:47.494 --> 01:02:53.698]  She sleeps in the same room with that creepy, weird woman whose mother wears a hood over her head.
[01:02:53.818 --> 01:02:55.198]  What the hell?
[01:02:55.238 --> 01:02:58.300]  That woman number one is ugly.
[01:02:59.101 --> 01:03:01.863]  Imagine how bad she smells, man.
[01:03:02.964 --> 01:03:05.470]  I'm told her and Obama just stink.
[01:03:06.812 --> 01:03:10.640]  Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[01:03:11.915 --> 01:03:16.276]  There's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[01:03:16.316 --> 01:03:18.076]  He said, me and Hillary are demons.
[01:03:18.417 --> 01:03:20.117]  Said we smell like something.
[01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:22.297]  Ain't that something?
[01:03:22.317 --> 01:03:25.258]  I have never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[01:03:25.278 --> 01:03:26.739]  People are telling me she smells.
[01:03:26.779 --> 01:03:28.939]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[01:03:45.891 --> 01:03:48.053]  You're such self-centered crap.
[01:03:48.233 --> 01:03:52.796]  We don't even know this hand itself rising up against us.
[01:03:52.876 --> 01:03:59.421]  Millions of pointed people of the very worst type, man, I'm so pissed.
[01:03:59.441 --> 01:04:04.044]  We're gonna stab your daughter at the mall.
[01:04:05.605 --> 01:04:07.987]  Oh, oh, oh.
[01:04:08.107 --> 01:04:11.730]  We're gonna stab your wife, your son.
[01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:30.785]  We're gonna stab you with a butcher knife And then the police chief is gonna say We love our Somalis We love our Muslims Oh, they're so good Oh, they're so sweet
[01:04:34.733 --> 01:04:40.378]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning, and they had the police chief on making excuses from that town in Minnesota.
[01:04:41.018 --> 01:04:46.883]  And they had the Fox News host, this is the Fair and Balanced Channel, going, Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[01:04:47.224 --> 01:04:50.867]  He said it was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing.
[01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:54.330]  And Hillary's on him, and she's got some really good points.
[01:05:13.885 --> 01:05:20.170]  After the success of Alpha Power, we decided to make a new powerhouse vitality formula built with the female biochemistry in mind.

[01:06:33.487 --> 01:06:39.051]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Monday, global broadcast, 17th day of December, 2018.
[01:06:39.592 --> 01:06:47.037]  I want to open the phones up in this hour, and the next, and Gerald Cilente joins us.
[01:06:47.057 --> 01:06:50.320]  We have another surprise guest popping in as well.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:53.402]  But I want to get your take on the yellow vest movement.
[01:06:55.163 --> 01:06:59.147]  I want to get your take on the overturn of Obamacare and the results of the left.
[01:06:59.997 --> 01:07:03.159]  Claiming that, no, you should be mandated to buy something from a private company.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:10.805]  Also, that it's in mainstream news, they're admitting that China and Russia are using big antenna arrays on the ground to manipulate and control the weather.
[01:07:11.205 --> 01:07:12.206]  Something, of course, the U.S.
[01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:15.548]  government's been doing for decades with HAARP and other similar technology.
[01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:25.034]  Also, look at the situation with President Trump and the Democrats' continued drive to remove him from office.
[01:07:25.995 --> 01:07:28.117]  And the fact that the public is just getting fatigued
[01:07:28.988 --> 01:07:30.732]  By the incredible, nasty attacks.
[01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:37.789]  And if you look at CNN, especially their website, you can see how they just recycle.
[01:07:39.065 --> 01:07:41.826]  Over and over and over again, the same BS.
[01:07:42.326 --> 01:07:43.827]  The walls are closing in on Trump.
[01:07:44.027 --> 01:07:47.849]  Oh, massive Russia bombshells coming in a month, and then it never happens.
[01:07:47.929 --> 01:07:51.970]  But it just sabotages the economy, sabotages the country.
[01:07:52.671 --> 01:08:04.335]  The Democrats openly trying to drive down the stock market, openly trying to have more interest rate hikes, and admitting they're doing it to plunge our nation into a new dark age.
[01:08:06.796 --> 01:08:07.997]  And then there's all the censorship.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:10.341]  And all the manipulation.
[01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:15.043]  You ask yourself, how much worse is it going to get?
[01:08:17.444 --> 01:08:19.165]  And is it the end of our empire?
[01:08:21.607 --> 01:08:22.207]  Is that a good thing?
[01:08:22.247 --> 01:08:22.867]  Is that a bad thing?
[01:08:22.887 --> 01:08:27.110]  Because America's been an empire, but it's been absorbed in this big globalist empire.
[01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:32.813]  And are people smart enough to get out of it?
[01:08:33.513 --> 01:08:38.656]  There's an article here, The Life Cycles of Empires, Lessons for America Today.
[01:08:40.373 --> 01:08:46.694]  And the truth is, we've become extremely, extremely decadent.
[01:08:46.714 --> 01:08:51.895]  We've become extremely over-entertained.
[01:08:52.956 --> 01:08:56.736]  And people can't differentiate from reality from unreality.
[01:08:57.977 --> 01:09:04.018]  And so I sit back and I ask myself, what will this country look like in 10 years and 20 years if we fail?
[01:09:08.851 --> 01:09:11.933]  Trump thought he could restart America, and to a certain extent, we've done it.
[01:09:13.675 --> 01:09:28.466]  But when we kick-started the country, and its pulse came back to life, Trump was sure that if he could get that done, people would wake up out of their fog, wake up out of their leftist-induced coma, and that we could fix things.
[01:09:30.088 --> 01:09:31.369]  And we've seen that to a certain extent.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:40.525]  The propaganda, the election fraud, the vote stealing, all of it is a green light to the establishment that no, Trump can be beaten.
[01:09:42.687 --> 01:09:46.449]  And it's breathed new life into them that they've gotten away with the massive censorship.
[01:09:46.469 --> 01:09:48.291]  They've gotten away with the incredible divide and conquer.
[01:09:48.611 --> 01:09:51.073]  They've gotten away with weaponizing media.
[01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:55.976]  They've gotten away with telling incredible lies stacked on more lies.
[01:09:58.338 --> 01:10:00.119]  Until you're just living in total fantasy land.
[01:10:08.686 --> 01:10:11.247]  So what do you think the world's going to look like in 20 years?
[01:10:11.767 --> 01:10:32.012]  If we've already got world government pushing implantable microchips to buy and sell and global social score is already here and all the big tech giants tracking everything you do and putting it into huge databases and trying to destroy middle-class wealth and really create a horrible future where everything is consolidated.
[01:10:32.572 --> 01:10:35.613]  What will the dystopia look like if we fail?
[01:10:37.349 --> 01:10:43.472]  Of course, some will say, many will say, well, it's in the Bible that the Antichrist wages war against the saints and overcomes them.
[01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:50.255]  And for a short time, there's a planetary world government, that if God didn't come back and stop it all, no flesh would be spared.
[01:10:51.216 --> 01:10:52.336]  Okay, well, when is that coming?
[01:10:52.577 --> 01:10:53.757]  What's that period look like?
[01:10:53.877 --> 01:10:58.620]  And shouldn't we, if that's the case, and the proper interpretation,
[01:10:59.628 --> 01:11:13.135]  Be warning everybody about the world government, about the microchip, about the beast system, so less you be saved, you would be deceived, you would be given over to a great delusion that 2 plus 2 equals 5, and that women are men and men are women?
[01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:27.083]  We're on a planet in deep space, and we are
[01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:36.538]  Under the control of some very nasty people, who the Bible tells us have been given power by the father of lies, the God of this world.
[01:11:37.519 --> 01:11:40.560]  The fallen one that fell to this planet, who's trapped on this planet.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:47.021]  And can only have dominion over us, not over the big boy out in space.
[01:11:48.282 --> 01:11:54.984]  And you sit back from a scientific cosmology, and you sit back and see what the globalists are building, and man, if it isn't exactly what
[01:11:56.155 --> 01:12:00.219]  God told the prophets to warn us about, I'll eat my hat.
[01:12:00.239 --> 01:12:04.323]  It's not like the David and Alan Coe song.
[01:12:04.824 --> 01:12:07.486]  If I ain't country, I'll kiss your big old fat booty.
[01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:08.948]  Couldn't quite say it like that.
[01:12:08.988 --> 01:12:09.868]  He says it better than that.
[01:12:13.732 --> 01:12:15.614]  Well, if that isn't prophecy, I'll eat my hat.
[01:12:15.734 --> 01:12:18.437]  I mean, this is in your face.
[01:12:29.349 --> 01:12:40.153]  So I'm going to give the number out, and you can talk about pretty much any of those subjects I threw out, bring up other subjects, that's fine, but I really want to have a debate and discussion about what are we going to do on this planet?
[01:12:40.173 --> 01:12:47.935]  Are we just going to watch basketball and go see movies and not care about where we came from or who we are or what's coming or care about our kids?
[01:12:48.515 --> 01:12:52.937]  Because it sounds to me like that's what's gotten us in this position is being asleep at the wheel.
[01:12:56.462 --> 01:13:04.066]  And you can sit there and say, take the wheel, Jesus, like this Islamic member of Congress said about Mike Pence, making fun of his Christian faith.
[01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.968]  But I do say, take the wheel, Jesus.
[01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:13.472]  But the only way for Jesus to take the wheel is through us, and that doesn't mean I'm up here on some high horse, and that I've got all the answers.
[01:13:13.892 --> 01:13:14.873]  I'm certainly not a Pharisee.
[01:13:16.153 --> 01:13:20.296]  The other day I did a rant that I should apologize for, and I shouldn't do it.
[01:13:20.636 --> 01:13:23.698]  I was not taking the Lord's name in vain when I said, GD, the globalist to hell.
[01:13:24.844 --> 01:13:27.545]  I was explaining that they don't want us calling the name of Jesus.
[01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:29.805]  I see something horrible happen my whole life.
[01:13:29.865 --> 01:13:34.866]  I say God's name because that just involuntarily comes out, calling on God.
[01:13:35.147 --> 01:13:36.407]  That's not taking God's name in vain.
[01:13:36.627 --> 01:13:37.367]  God judges the heart.
[01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:38.887]  I mean, Jesus help us.
[01:13:40.608 --> 01:13:41.768]  The globals don't like that name.
[01:13:42.988 --> 01:13:45.469]  And they don't want us to pray to God to damn our enemies.
[01:13:45.829 --> 01:13:52.791]  So see, they get the super right-wing, not even right-wing churches, like my mom's mom, super sweet Baptist lady,
[01:13:54.022 --> 01:14:00.286]  You know, Baylor type, to think that if somebody says, man, I hope God damns those pedophiles to hell.
[01:14:00.306 --> 01:14:02.768]  Well, that's not taking God's name in vain.
[01:14:02.988 --> 01:14:04.169]  That's a real truthful statement.
[01:14:04.209 --> 01:14:06.991]  God, I hope you send these people to hell.
[01:14:07.191 --> 01:14:09.393]  I hope you, I hope you get them away from us.
[01:14:10.354 --> 01:14:11.274]  And God hears that.
[01:14:15.377 --> 01:14:16.298]  And God hates liars.
[01:14:16.358 --> 01:14:19.120]  So I don't, in my God-fearing, in my conscience,
[01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:21.236]  Very strong conscience.
[01:14:21.657 --> 01:14:25.939]  I don't feel like God's mad at me when I say, GD pedophiles to hell.
[01:14:26.659 --> 01:14:28.200]  Or people trying to sexualize children.
[01:14:29.441 --> 01:14:30.962]  I mean, I feel good when I say that.
[01:14:33.163 --> 01:14:35.744]  But see, the churches want to turn men into these wimps.
[01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:41.027]  And these little gilded, you know, people that lay down to everything and go along.
[01:14:41.047 --> 01:14:43.448]  And look, I'm not criticizing pacifists, Christian groups.
[01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:47.951]  If you feel called to be a pacifist,
[01:14:49.858 --> 01:14:50.819]  Then that's your business.
[01:14:50.879 --> 01:14:57.643]  But the whole New Testament, Old Testament is about sometimes somebody stands up and uses a sword to defend themselves.
[01:14:58.144 --> 01:15:01.086]  Sometimes they don't at the time to be a sacrifice.
[01:15:01.606 --> 01:15:11.513]  Christ was being a sacrifice for our sins, even though he could have destroyed the Romans or the Pharisee Jews or any of those people anytime he wanted to.
[01:15:12.093 --> 01:15:13.114]  He was an example.
[01:15:15.235 --> 01:15:15.796]  But he said,
[01:15:16.877 --> 01:15:21.519]  In the garden that night before they grabbed him, next time sell your cloak and buy a sword.
[01:15:22.319 --> 01:15:25.080]  And he overturned the money changer's tables and beat him with a whip.
[01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:33.064]  And so, it's all about when do you physically fight, when do you not physically fight.
[01:15:33.824 --> 01:15:38.006]  And that's called discernment and common sense, but it's time
[01:15:39.309 --> 01:15:42.393]  For people to realize that these churches are just social clubs.
[01:15:43.274 --> 01:15:45.857]  And they're 501c3 systems of the establishment.
[01:15:46.157 --> 01:15:48.100]  You're not going to find God in most of these places.
[01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.842]  You're going to find God in the Bible.
[01:15:50.182 --> 01:15:51.323]  You're going to find God with discernment.
[01:15:51.344 --> 01:15:53.947]  You're going to find God when you ask Christ into your heart.
[01:15:54.988 --> 01:15:56.570]  That's your priest, Jesus Christ.
[01:15:56.690 --> 01:15:57.251]  Not the priest.
[01:16:03.564 --> 01:16:04.344]  Silver.
[01:16:04.364 --> 01:16:05.785]  2018 has come and it's almost gone.
[01:16:05.805 --> 01:16:08.485]  And it's been one incredible year.
[01:16:08.525 --> 01:16:09.745]  It's been a serious fight.
[01:16:10.285 --> 01:16:14.586]  But nationalism and populism and Christianity are coming back across the world.
[01:16:14.606 --> 01:16:18.667]  Thanks to God shining through you and your family.
[01:16:19.067 --> 01:16:20.787]  Thanks to you taking action.
[01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:24.008]  So I want to thank you for what you've done.
[01:16:24.788 --> 01:16:29.389]  You are literally the strength, the blood, the guts, the win in our sails.
[01:16:29.789 --> 01:16:30.129]  Literally.
[01:16:31.226 --> 01:16:42.689]  So I want to salute you and thank you for what you've done, and I want to encourage you to get great products like the supplements and the water filtration, the air filtration, the Patriot apparel, all of it, at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:47.470]  If you get your orders in by the 19th, you're guaranteed to get it in the continental United States before Christmas.
[01:16:48.090 --> 01:16:49.611]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds.
[01:16:50.011 --> 01:16:57.173]  Go there, get great products that you and your family need that are game-changing, that are life-changing, and help us fund into the new year.
[01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:57.953]  Help us
[01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:04.693]  Stand against George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the globalists.
[01:17:04.773 --> 01:17:05.195]  Help us!
[01:17:06.718 --> 01:17:09.539]  Stand in the way of their plans and their operations.
[01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:21.863]  At the same time, getting amazing products like BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and X2 and X3 of SuperBell Vitality, and Brain Force, and Lung Cleanse, and Knockout, and Alpha Power, and so many other amazing products.
[01:17:22.363 --> 01:17:26.844]  Whatever the best products are, we do the research, and that's what we bring you, because we want to work for you.
[01:17:27.185 --> 01:17:29.005]  We want it to be amazing, so you order it again.
[01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:31.206]  We treat you just like we want to be treated.
[01:17:31.786 --> 01:17:33.827]  Because we respect you, and we appreciate you.
[01:17:33.967 --> 01:17:39.869]  You know, the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, and then Christ's rule, lay down your life for others.
[01:17:39.929 --> 01:17:42.150]  Isn't that the world you want to live in?
[01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:46.672]  With a bunch of heroes, people that are ready to fight and stand up, instead of a bunch of backstabbing cowards?
[01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:49.273]  That's the world that builds civilization.
[01:17:49.313 --> 01:17:50.554]  That's the world that builds it all.
[01:17:50.854 --> 01:17:55.215]  So when I treat you like I want to be treated, it's because I respect myself and I respect you.
[01:17:55.716 --> 01:17:56.716]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:17:56.936 --> 01:17:57.616]  Biggest sales ever.
[01:17:57.656 --> 01:17:59.877]  Free shipping storewide, and so much more.
[01:17:59.897 --> 01:18:00.758]  But it's your last chance.
[01:18:00.778 --> 01:18:01.358]  Please take action.
[01:18:06.622 --> 01:18:15.345]  I've been on air 23 plus years and I've learned a lot about sales because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution Bill of Rights and our way of life.
[01:18:16.145 --> 01:18:20.706]  I was never classically trained but over the last 23 years I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[01:18:21.407 --> 01:18:26.688]  Now there's lots of philosophies about have something really really expensive and a certain percentage will buy it believing it's the best.
[01:18:27.488 --> 01:18:28.389]  That's not what I do.
[01:18:29.189 --> 01:18:31.730]  I try to find the very best products that are popular
[01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:35.471]  Get the best deal on it so I can sell the most of it.
[01:18:35.531 --> 01:18:36.731]  That seems to be like common sense.
[01:18:36.851 --> 01:18:44.974]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:52.436]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, water filtration, gravity-fed systems, because they're the very best.
[01:18:52.556 --> 01:18:57.197]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price, and so we are the biggest distributor.
[01:18:57.377 --> 01:19:00.418]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[01:19:01.258 --> 01:19:03.840]  Of $127,000 on that water filtration system.
[01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:06.102]  Because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[01:19:06.222 --> 01:19:07.423]  We sold out of it.
[01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:08.583]  They didn't think we could do it.
[01:19:09.224 --> 01:19:09.804]  You responded.
[01:19:09.844 --> 01:19:10.845]  You went and did your own research.
[01:19:11.085 --> 01:19:12.226]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:17.430]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration 4-stage ion filter.
[01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:21.033]  When they came to me 5 years ago and said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[01:19:21.093 --> 01:19:21.773]  Meeting competitors are $500,000, $600,000, $800,000.
[01:19:21.853 --> 01:19:22.974]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[01:19:25.776 --> 01:19:27.277]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[01:19:27.477 --> 01:19:29.018]  I said, great, absolutely.
[01:19:29.058 --> 01:19:31.720]  I just bought filters for $400, $600, $700 that weren't even as good.
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.221]  So I knew it was a great deal.
[01:19:33.361 --> 01:19:37.284]  Now they've been able to lower the price because they've expanded how many they're having manufactured to $200.
[01:19:37.884 --> 01:19:41.467]  Ladies and gentlemen, at year end, they're doing it again, just like they did with the water filter.
[01:19:41.727 --> 01:19:44.448]  The Alexa Pure Breeze 4-stage ion filter is now $127.
[01:19:44.508 --> 01:19:50.150]  These units are amazing for yourself to put under the tree as gifts, and it funds the InfoWar.
[01:19:50.170 --> 01:19:57.573]  So get Alexa Pure Breeze today at the lowest price ever advertised, $127, at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:19:57.873 --> 01:19:58.673]  It's a 360 win.
[01:19:58.953 --> 01:20:00.194]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:20:06.456 --> 01:20:09.077]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.512 --> 01:20:28.438]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:43.094]  So, I'm going to give the number out right now.
[01:20:43.114 --> 01:20:48.996]  Toll for your number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:20:49.016 --> 01:20:49.456]  877-789-2539.
[01:20:49.476 --> 01:20:50.656]  We have such amazing callers.
[01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:54.317]  What is the earth going to look like in 10, 20, 30 years?
[01:20:55.237 --> 01:20:59.238]  Why is revelation so accurate and actually being manifest now?
[01:21:02.058 --> 01:21:05.699]  Why are so many people going along with the globalists even though it's against their own self-interest?
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:09.100]  How do we counter this evil?
[01:21:10.587 --> 01:21:11.788]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:21:15.209 --> 01:21:18.750]  Another big question that goes along with this, gut level, what do you think of President Trump?
[01:21:20.951 --> 01:21:35.396]  I watch the President try to get so many good things done, get a lot of things done, fail on other fronts, and I think about the man in the arena, and I know how much I've been lied about, how much I've been demonized, how much I've been attacked, and I know that he's been under the very same tactics, but even worse.
[01:21:36.656 --> 01:21:44.000]  And so it makes me admire him more and want to defend him more because I've already paid so much for defending the president.
[01:21:46.562 --> 01:21:47.983]  But I don't want that to be a blind spot.
[01:21:49.704 --> 01:21:55.227]  So I was really thinking this weekend about Trump's deficiencies that are our own deficiencies.
[01:21:58.529 --> 01:22:00.330]  He gives orders to his cabinet.
[01:22:00.591 --> 01:22:02.392]  Most of the stuff he says, they just ignore.
[01:22:02.412 --> 01:22:04.333]  And that's come out.
[01:22:05.472 --> 01:22:10.236]  He talks about implanted groups, embedded groups, ignoring what he says and what he does.
[01:22:10.936 --> 01:22:26.848]  A story came out this weekend that I'm going to cover later in the next hour after I take some calls that confirms everything we already knew was going on and how they're blocking Trump and how they're blocking other nationalists and how they're blocking other populists.
[01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:30.631]  It's a Zero Hedge article.
[01:22:34.295 --> 01:22:39.079]  But I sent the producers Sunday, but I ended up not hosting the Sunday show.
[01:22:39.139 --> 01:22:45.964]  Owen did because of family reasons, but if somebody can reprint me that Zero Hedge article, I meant to even leave the show with that today, but there's just so much happening.
[01:22:48.145 --> 01:22:51.128]  But specifically, Trump needs to stop the censorship.
[01:22:51.988 --> 01:22:56.472]  He needs to know what it's designed to do and how to counter it.
[01:22:58.035 --> 01:23:09.967]  He needs to expose the fact that we have real traitors in our government sold out to the Communist Chinese or he'll never be able to fix anything because he's facing such a massive, concerted, bold system of fraud.
[01:23:11.268 --> 01:23:16.453]  It's so criminal that any other smaller measures don't even measure up to deal with it.
[01:23:33.254 --> 01:23:36.195]  We'll get to it coming up a little bit later in the transmission.
[01:23:36.275 --> 01:23:42.276]  But we have the specifics of what they're doing.
[01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.816]  We know their program.
[01:23:45.856 --> 01:23:46.616]  We know their plan.
[01:23:48.677 --> 01:23:58.139]  And it's so outrageous because it's completely illegal what the establishment's doing.
[01:23:59.399 --> 01:24:00.559]  It's totally transparent.
[01:24:02.563 --> 01:24:12.185]  And you could say that we have them by the short hairs, but no one knows how to execute because the good people are so judicious.
[01:24:13.946 --> 01:24:27.449]  The good people out there are so nice that they want to do things absolutely perfectly and they want to be free market and they don't want to mess anything up.
[01:24:28.089 --> 01:24:30.590]  So it opens up this giant power vacuum
[01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.181]  It allows the establishment to totally run wild.
[01:24:36.502 --> 01:24:38.803]  And here's the article I'm gonna get into more in the next hour.
[01:24:38.823 --> 01:24:42.466]  It's up on Infowars.com from ZeroHedge.com.
[01:24:43.226 --> 01:24:46.408]  ZeroHedge is one of the best publications out there.
[01:24:46.428 --> 01:24:48.169]  The folks that run it know what they're talking about.
[01:24:49.470 --> 01:24:56.694]  Leaked memo touts UK-funded firm's ability to create untraceable new sites for information warfare campaign.
[01:24:59.596 --> 01:25:01.057]  Now, that's a nice headline.
[01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:20.783]  But when we get to it later, I'm going to give it the proper headline, because this would be, Leaked Memo Opens a Window into International Spy Network's Fake News Campaign Against Nationalists.
[01:25:23.864 --> 01:25:25.545]  In fact, that's not even hardcore enough, because
[01:25:26.946 --> 01:25:33.771]  Leaked Memo is a blueprint for how the deep state is destroying nationalist and independent media.
[01:25:34.532 --> 01:25:38.975]  It talks about how to first demonize somebody and lie about them and build a straw man.
[01:25:43.899 --> 01:25:46.882]  Then it talks about how you fund the lawsuits to make it look legitimate.
[01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.585]  Then it talks about how you then de-platform people.
[01:25:54.127 --> 01:25:55.809]  And then how you go after them criminally.
[01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:57.958]  Exactly what we've seen.
[01:25:58.418 --> 01:26:01.019]  Alex, how did you know you didn't have the memos?
[01:26:02.299 --> 01:26:09.721]  Because when you've got a thousand articles a day at the peak, coming out saying the exact same lies, in the exact same order, that's coordinated.
[01:26:09.741 --> 01:26:20.423]  And that was in the last executive order Obama signed creating these, Trump calls them embedded groups, stay behind groups is what they're technically called.
[01:26:23.483 --> 01:26:25.404]  So, we're fighting
[01:26:26.585 --> 01:26:29.087]  Rogue intelligence agencies, and that's all in here.
[01:26:30.008 --> 01:26:36.194]  The US, France, and England working against nationalists everywhere to destroy them.
[01:26:42.519 --> 01:26:45.181]  So that's coming up next hour, and we're going to continue with calls as well.
[01:26:47.443 --> 01:26:49.806]  And I'm going to hit some of the other video clips and things we haven't gotten to.
[01:26:49.826 --> 01:26:50.506]  There's a lot.
[01:26:52.628 --> 01:26:53.449]  Please don't forget.
[01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.074]  That without you, we won't be here.
[01:26:56.834 --> 01:26:59.895]  And that doesn't just mean getting the products at InfoWarsTore.com that are excellent.
[01:26:59.915 --> 01:27:01.176]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:27:02.377 --> 01:27:06.418]  Listeners have really been coming through, supporting the transmission through these unprecedented attacks.
[01:27:06.859 --> 01:27:08.859]  But just remember that local AM or FM station.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.020]  Tell people about it.
[01:27:11.081 --> 01:27:14.122]  Tell people not just about my show, but other good shows that are telling the truth.
[01:27:16.643 --> 01:27:20.525]  Share with people the link to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:22.853 --> 01:27:31.720]  Infowars.com forward slash show where they can find my podcast, David Knight's podcast, Owen Schroer's podcast, and all of the live feeds and the audio feeds.
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:34.041]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:27:34.542 --> 01:27:36.683]  And the other shows we have, like CounterThink with Mike Adams.
[01:27:39.645 --> 01:27:41.687]  And whatever you do, please continue to pray for the broadcast.
[01:27:41.707 --> 01:27:42.688]  It's really changing the world.
[01:27:42.828 --> 01:27:45.450]  And then yes, we've had a lot of big specials.
[01:27:45.990 --> 01:27:47.391]  We normally market products 150%, supplement-wise.
[01:27:47.431 --> 01:27:47.751]  T-shirts 100%.
[01:27:52.287 --> 01:27:55.889]  Other supplement folks about five to seven times because there's a lot of money goes into it.
[01:27:56.389 --> 01:27:57.390]  Advertising distribution.
[01:27:57.430 --> 01:28:00.752]  Well, we just, regular retail is 150% on average.
[01:28:01.853 --> 01:28:03.093]  We normally discount it quite a bit.
[01:28:03.113 --> 01:28:04.954]  So usually we sell at 100% retail.
[01:28:06.355 --> 01:28:08.316]  Meaning if something costs us 10 bucks, you're getting it for 20.
[01:28:10.037 --> 01:28:17.442]  With the sales we're doing now at 50 to 75% off, free shipping and a free t-shirt on every order.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:22.183]  We're talking about most of these lose money.
[01:28:22.903 --> 01:28:24.225]  But it gets a t-shirt out there.
[01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.646]  You see how great the products are.
[01:28:26.346 --> 01:28:30.290]  And hopefully, and we're seeing this, a lot of new customers come in for deals that good.
[01:28:30.310 --> 01:28:31.731]  These are way better than Amazon.
[01:28:32.151 --> 01:28:33.072]  And you get hooked.
[01:28:33.532 --> 01:28:34.433]  You like X3.
[01:28:34.473 --> 01:28:35.574]  You like Super Metal Vitality.
[01:28:35.854 --> 01:28:36.795]  You like Alpha Power.
[01:28:36.855 --> 01:28:38.016]  You like Rainforce Plus.
[01:28:38.997 --> 01:28:41.319]  So, the 12 days of Christmas are coming to an end.
[01:28:41.339 --> 01:28:45.002]  You got to get your orders in by the 19th to have a guaranteed delivery before
[01:28:46.291 --> 01:28:46.672]  Christmas!
[01:28:47.312 --> 01:28:53.380]  And you can also go there and put in the note, so there's a note on the order form that's a gift note.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.644]  You can say, hey Bob, or hey mom, or hey dad, or hey son or daughter.
[01:28:56.664 --> 01:29:00.650]  You can put on the order where it's from, put in their address and send it to them as well.
[01:29:08.942 --> 01:29:17.189]  Please, don't forget, we're running the biggest specials ever in InfoWars because Soros and the Globalists are on record trying to take all of our payment processors and totally shut us down.
[01:29:17.389 --> 01:29:18.690]  And so this is the war.
[01:29:18.730 --> 01:29:21.592]  They're taking everyone off the air they think is effective.
[01:29:21.632 --> 01:29:24.455]  But InfoWars is still standing because you financially supported us.
[01:29:24.915 --> 01:29:31.319]  I have usually inventory for 5-6 months in t-shirts, in books, in films, in supplements, in coffee.
[01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:40.905]  This time, I am doing sales that are clearly 30-40% bigger than they've ever been because we have a plan to shell everything out of the warehouse.
[01:29:40.985 --> 01:29:43.666]  And we've already got the model ready to go with sponsors.
[01:29:43.766 --> 01:29:49.170]  Something you've seen me discard, you hear the radio, that's fine, but I've discarded sponsorship for about 7-8 years.
[01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:50.170]  It's been successful.
[01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:52.892]  Directly getting funding from you with great products, but if they take
[01:29:52.932 --> 01:29:53.812]  By the way, don't worry.
[01:29:53.992 --> 01:29:56.493]  I've got all the big sponsors lined up as well.
[01:29:56.573 --> 01:29:58.213]  So, and if we keep both, that's even better.
[01:29:58.233 --> 01:30:00.014]  We'll just expand Battlefront even faster.
[01:30:00.054 --> 01:30:01.454]  But we're not giving up effort.
[01:30:01.474 --> 01:30:03.314]  That which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[01:30:03.355 --> 01:30:10.296]  So, you need to support us, but you're supporting yourself, not fighting traffic, not fighting the crowds, getting great presents, helping the economy, all the rest of it.
[01:30:10.396 --> 01:30:11.696]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[01:30:11.777 --> 01:30:12.877]  Hey, we're all Alex Jones.
[01:30:12.997 --> 01:30:13.917]  Don't censor me.
[01:30:13.977 --> 01:30:15.537]  Gadsden flag, black on white t-shirt.
[01:30:15.717 --> 01:30:17.058]  It's unisex, great for men and women.
[01:30:17.098 --> 01:30:17.598]  You pick your side.
[01:30:17.618 --> 01:30:17.898]  It's free.
[01:30:18.018 --> 01:30:18.498]  Free shipping.
[01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:19.919]  Double Patriot points in your next order.
[01:30:19.939 --> 01:30:21.160]  10% to the 5% on every dollar.
[01:30:21.180 --> 01:30:25.183]  You know, we have a special going where we have a special every day where something is 60% off.
[01:30:25.343 --> 01:30:27.224]  But go look at all the specials because some things are 75% off.
[01:30:48.318 --> 01:30:49.899]  And it's all flying out.
[01:30:50.059 --> 01:30:54.920]  Let me tell you, at the warehouse here in Austin, the little elves are working 24 hours a day.
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:58.081]  We brought on extra shifts, and thanks to you, we're selling it all out.
[01:30:58.341 --> 01:31:00.242]  The entire, everything.
[01:31:00.262 --> 01:31:00.562]  Boom!
[01:31:00.582 --> 01:31:00.742]  Gone.
[01:31:00.902 --> 01:31:01.922]  All gonna be gone.
[01:31:02.062 --> 01:31:03.883]  In fact, this new shirt, we printed up a lot of it.
[01:31:03.963 --> 01:31:05.063]  It's about to be gone.
[01:31:05.143 --> 01:31:06.884]  We'll have a new shirt that we have inventory of.
[01:31:06.904 --> 01:31:08.344]  It'll be the new free shirt by tomorrow.
[01:31:08.584 --> 01:31:11.306]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:11.406 --> 01:31:18.750]  And we're going to sell out by Wednesday, they're saying, of the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration systems.
[01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:19.830]  Leading competitors are $600, $700.
[01:31:20.111 --> 01:31:21.271]  It's always a great deal at $240.
[01:31:21.331 --> 01:31:22.232]  Four-stage ion filter.
[01:31:22.412 --> 01:31:23.673]  The factory had a glut of those.
[01:31:23.693 --> 01:31:24.813]  They want to sell it as an inventory.
[01:31:24.933 --> 01:31:25.073]  It's $127.
[01:31:25.434 --> 01:31:27.375]  They're selling them to us at cost.
[01:31:27.415 --> 01:31:28.075]  We make like $30.
[01:31:28.715 --> 01:31:30.296]  No deal is even near this.
[01:31:30.596 --> 01:31:32.417]  For you and your family, get an Alexa Pure Breeze now.
[01:31:32.638 --> 01:31:35.439]  But watch, the special will be gone just like Alexa Pure Pro water filters.
[01:31:35.459 --> 01:31:36.120]  Those did sell out.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:36.820]  This will be gone.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:40.401]  No one even gets close to this, because we're the biggest distributor for this top company.
[01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.242]  We got this deal.
[01:31:41.422 --> 01:31:42.302]  No one else got this.
[01:31:42.382 --> 01:31:44.323]  You got this, because the owner is a rabid listener.
[01:31:44.463 --> 01:31:44.963]  Matt Redhaugh.
[01:31:45.163 --> 01:31:46.624]  Boy, has he been harassed for being a supporter.
[01:31:46.784 --> 01:31:48.084]  Oh, let me tell you, I'm not supposed to.
[01:31:48.244 --> 01:31:48.985]  He's another patriot.
[01:31:49.005 --> 01:31:49.805]  So, we're here.
[01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.226]  We stand with those that stand with us.
[01:31:51.546 --> 01:31:52.646]  We thank you for supporting us.
[01:31:53.046 --> 01:31:53.967]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:31:53.987 --> 01:31:54.747]  Make that commitment.
[01:31:54.767 --> 01:31:55.227]  Get in there.
[01:31:55.367 --> 01:31:56.308]  Get the great products.
[01:31:56.348 --> 01:31:57.308]  Get the lowest prices.
[01:31:57.468 --> 01:31:59.849]  And help fund the Second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:06.132]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[01:32:06.412 --> 01:32:09.854]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[01:32:10.195 --> 01:32:19.720]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double-blind FDA-cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:23.664]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[01:32:24.025 --> 01:32:28.990]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:31.413]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[01:32:31.673 --> 01:32:36.338]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[01:32:36.358 --> 01:32:36.919]  Ah, you don't want that.
[01:32:37.339 --> 01:32:41.141]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[01:32:41.361 --> 01:32:44.022]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[01:32:44.282 --> 01:32:47.604]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[01:32:47.964 --> 01:32:53.266]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[01:32:53.346 --> 01:32:57.488]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[01:32:58.349 --> 01:33:01.030]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:33:06.427 --> 01:33:10.589]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.654 --> 01:33:26.617]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.997 --> 01:33:33.440]  You know, there's so many things to talk about that are in the news today.
[01:33:34.591 --> 01:33:35.472]  We'll be covering those.
[01:33:36.112 --> 01:33:44.477]  But what about just the big picture of technology and nanotech and digital barcodes to buy and sell?
[01:33:44.517 --> 01:33:53.262]  I mean, it's all here and it's all being used, just like the Bible predicted, just like other people predicted, for tracking and controlling and oppressing people.
[01:33:54.143 --> 01:33:56.905]  I mean, how did people 2,000 years ago predict all of this?
[01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:58.886]  And what's going to happen to President Trump?
[01:33:58.906 --> 01:34:00.106]  What's going to happen to America?
[01:34:01.367 --> 01:34:02.748]  Again, we see a lot of nationalism.
[01:34:02.768 --> 01:34:03.989]  We see a lot of people waking up.
[01:34:05.162 --> 01:34:10.306]  We see a lot of people saying no to the New World Order, but at the same time, it is a powerful force.
[01:34:10.326 --> 01:34:14.489]  So how do you, as listeners, see this unfolding?
[01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:18.052]  And then continuing with the whole Russiagate thing.
[01:34:19.433 --> 01:34:28.459]  They've now announced that two have been charged, two Michael Flynn associates charged over illegal lobbying for Turkey.
[01:34:30.921 --> 01:34:33.423]  Everybody kept asking, why did Michael Flynn, General Flynn,
[01:34:35.757 --> 01:34:36.278]  Instantly.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:39.540]  Plead guilty.
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.202]  Well, they said, oh, he was going to lose his house, which he did.
[01:34:42.262 --> 01:34:51.590]  And why did he go hire former Attorney General Eric Holder's law firm, the Democrats, to basically walk him to the gallows when there was no Russiagate?
[01:34:52.251 --> 01:34:54.072]  Well, what did I tell you a year and a half ago?
[01:34:54.693 --> 01:34:59.677]  Because he didn't fill out paperwork lobbying for Erdogan.
[01:35:00.718 --> 01:35:01.018]  Turkey.
[01:35:02.913 --> 01:35:08.358]  And you're talking about a small fine here, but not if Robert Mueller's on your bike.
[01:35:09.599 --> 01:35:12.401]  And now, that's next year's news today.
[01:35:12.421 --> 01:35:27.315]  The Hill, associates of one-time National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, are being charged with illegally lobbying for the extradition of the head of the Gulen network, a U.S.-based Turkish cleric who's been a frequent public target of the Turkish president.
[01:35:27.335 --> 01:35:29.016]  And it goes on from there.
[01:35:29.036 --> 01:35:29.857]  Yeah, there was a plan.
[01:35:32.113 --> 01:35:34.614]  To basically kidnapping.
[01:35:35.454 --> 01:35:38.294]  Not by Flynn, but by others.
[01:35:39.875 --> 01:35:41.515]  So, no Russia involvement.
[01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:42.755]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:35:43.215 --> 01:35:48.356]  Oh, but don't worry, CNN and everybody else says the vice is closing, the walls are closing in on Trump.
[01:35:49.797 --> 01:35:55.178]  While they're looking at all of his businesses now and everything else, and none of it has to do with what?
[01:35:55.478 --> 01:35:56.358]  Russia!
[01:35:57.838 --> 01:36:01.679]  Oh, but we're supposed to forget about all that now and just segue on.
[01:36:03.544 --> 01:36:05.525]  Like this little headline out of the Washington Examiner.
[01:36:06.146 --> 01:36:09.488]  Trump borrows rat nickname for Michael Cohen from Matt Drudge.
[01:36:09.528 --> 01:36:13.971]  Well, a rose by a rose's name is any other thing but a rose.
[01:36:14.491 --> 01:36:15.312]  Being sarcastic, no.
[01:36:15.632 --> 01:36:16.433]  A rat is a rat.
[01:36:17.273 --> 01:36:18.234]  A rose is a rose.
[01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:20.976]  A rose by any other name is still a rose.
[01:36:21.476 --> 01:36:26.980]  President Trump has long given his advisors original nicknames to mock and diminish them.
[01:36:28.461 --> 01:36:32.724]  But Drudge, having a big enough platform, has given him the name The Rat.
[01:36:34.445 --> 01:36:35.846]  And the guy is a rat.
[01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:43.693]  Vladimir Putin seeing much of gangster rap as a CIA weapon program to bring down society.
[01:36:43.713 --> 01:36:44.653]  He's talking about banning it.
[01:36:44.693 --> 01:36:46.195]  That will only proliferate it faster.
[01:36:47.756 --> 01:36:50.018]  Alarm of the growing popularity of rap music among Russian youth.
[01:36:50.358 --> 01:36:55.723]  President Vladimir Putin wants cultural leaders to devise a means of controlling rather than banning the popular music.
[01:36:56.803 --> 01:36:58.665]  It was impossible to stop, he said at St.
[01:36:58.685 --> 01:37:00.446]  Petersburg meeting with cultural advisor Saturday.
[01:37:00.707 --> 01:37:03.449]  We must lead in and direct it.
[01:37:05.464 --> 01:37:06.405]  I agree with that statement.
[01:37:07.846 --> 01:37:18.856]  By the way, I've been in the room with people that were in the room decades ago who were top rock stars, you name it, and they were told, and top hip-hop people, your message is too uplifting.
[01:37:20.157 --> 01:37:20.958]  It's too empowering.
[01:37:22.259 --> 01:37:24.501]  It's too rebellious against the system.
[01:37:24.821 --> 01:37:30.006]  Rock and roll, which has previously been funded by the CIA, to take down things like the Soviet Union.
[01:37:30.947 --> 01:37:32.208]  They said, we want oppressive stuff.
[01:37:33.387 --> 01:37:38.290]  And they said, you better start learning gangster thug raps, what they called it in the meetings.
[01:37:38.610 --> 01:37:41.772]  You better, it was called gangster rap later, you better start learning thug rap.
[01:37:42.512 --> 01:37:45.334]  Because we found people that listen to this kill each other and end up in prison.
[01:37:46.554 --> 01:37:49.956]  Now this is social engineers in the CIA, not the whole CIA.
[01:37:50.496 --> 01:37:52.758]  This has all been declassified, by the way, large parts of it.
[01:37:54.158 --> 01:37:55.239]  It's fascinating stuff.
[01:37:55.999 --> 01:37:56.920]  Make a whole documentary on it.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.642]  But long story short,
[01:38:02.779 --> 01:38:14.025]  They wanted this destructive stuff in the community to teach young men that not having a job, acting like a thug, being violent's cool, when all it does is prepare you for prison in a big way.
[01:38:16.086 --> 01:38:18.868]  And so, I mean, I can tell Putin, I can tell everybody how you counter this.
[01:38:20.448 --> 01:38:24.771]  You go out, and you don't try to be cool.
[01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:28.833]  You don't try to act like you're another rapper to counter it.
[01:38:31.522 --> 01:38:43.487]  You just point blank, speak directly to the youth, and explain that this is an outside force being brought in to prepare you for prison and for the destabilization of civilization.
[01:38:45.068 --> 01:38:55.892]  Because everything that's been done in America, the attack on the family, the gangster rap, turning country music into gangster rap, all of it is designed to destroy culture, period!
[01:38:56.892 --> 01:39:00.254]  And you straight shoot young people and say, don't be chumps,
[01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:03.772]  And you know, don't think it's cool to act like a thug.
[01:39:06.294 --> 01:39:08.555]  Most of them will see that and know that it's not cool.
[01:39:10.156 --> 01:39:11.397]  You simply try to just ban it.
[01:39:11.878 --> 01:39:12.758]  It's going to be underground.
[01:39:12.818 --> 01:39:13.539]  It's going to be great.
[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:20.764]  Instead, they ought to walk into all their gymnasiums with a whole school assembly and play the worst stuff there in front of it.
[01:39:22.225 --> 01:39:29.691]  And then put up images of young youth caught with drugs and guns and doing illegal stuff and show how they're dead or how they're in prison and saying, is this who you want to be?
[01:39:30.691 --> 01:39:31.972]  And just be point-blank with people.
[01:39:33.373 --> 01:39:35.375]  Young people want the whole story.
[01:39:36.636 --> 01:39:42.141]  Ask them, hey, funny, the big Hollywood, the big powerful moguls, they're the ones pushing this in our country.
[01:39:42.502 --> 01:39:43.502]  They're the ones that want us.
[01:39:43.563 --> 01:39:45.124]  George Soros wants you to be a loser.
[01:39:45.484 --> 01:39:50.048]  In America, they teach their five-year-olds to wear dresses so they won't have children.
[01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:51.690]  Do you want to be like that?
[01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:53.672]  Because the Americans have already fallen to this.
[01:39:53.912 --> 01:39:54.913]  Do you want to be pathetic?
[01:39:57.639 --> 01:39:59.520]  Just like we're like, you want to live under the Soviet Union?
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.961]  You want to live under what they live under?
[01:40:01.001 --> 01:40:01.721]  Don't be pathetic!
[01:40:04.083 --> 01:40:09.686]  And you make it about nationalism, tribalism, because it's real and it trumps all this garbage.
[01:40:12.668 --> 01:40:13.468]  Now there it is, U.S.
[01:40:13.568 --> 01:40:16.810]  agency infiltrated Cuban hip-hop scene to spark youth unrest.
[01:40:19.592 --> 01:40:20.713]  But now they don't want that.
[01:40:21.853 --> 01:40:26.356]  They want you to be primed and ready to go into the drug culture to be destroyed.
[01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.355]  All right, let's just stop there.
[01:40:36.936 --> 01:40:51.600]  I promise when I come back from break, I'm gonna be a good boy, and I'm gonna go right to Nick, Tyler, Carlos, Cameron, Howard, Wilde, Shabazz, James, Leonard, Grant, and others.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:52.340]  Boom, boom, boom.
[01:40:55.221 --> 01:40:57.402]  It's all coming up next segment.
[01:40:57.442 --> 01:41:00.963]  But if you're a new listener, or you're a new viewer,
[01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:04.258]  We have a great crew in there that's so fast I can't even believe it.
[01:41:05.518 --> 01:41:07.419]  I talk about something, they're able to pull it up.
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:11.001]  Because we're not pre-planning all this, I just do research.
[01:41:11.541 --> 01:41:13.482]  And they just kind of follow along or add their own research.
[01:41:13.502 --> 01:41:16.643]  But if you're a radio listener, it's a little bit different dimension.
[01:41:16.663 --> 01:41:20.124]  You hear me making these claims, you're not seeing the news articles up in front of your video clips.
[01:41:21.725 --> 01:41:25.687]  Search CIA financed ugly art and ugly architecture.
[01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:31.409]  Now, I grew up hearing this, but it was declassified in the last five years.
[01:41:32.827 --> 01:41:34.168]  Well, if you go look at the U.S.
[01:41:34.188 --> 01:41:41.813]  Capitol building or surrounding buildings, and you look at other architecture, it's not even comparable.
[01:41:44.014 --> 01:41:46.596]  And they admit that they build these public spaces.
[01:41:46.936 --> 01:41:49.998]  Paul Watson did an excellent, he's done two videos on modern architecture.
[01:41:53.180 --> 01:41:58.463]  And they are meant to absolutely crush the human spirit.
[01:42:00.475 --> 01:42:10.180]  You take young people in and you show them an image of a urinal, or an image of just a white sheet of paper, and then they're told, someone was paid five million dollars for this.
[01:42:10.821 --> 01:42:12.222]  It makes you disrespect art.
[01:42:14.383 --> 01:42:18.665]  Or if you show them something that a three-year-old could paint, it makes them disrespect art.
[01:42:19.386 --> 01:42:20.566]  And it doesn't mean it's not art.
[01:42:21.367 --> 01:42:22.407]  Anything somebody makes is art.
[01:42:22.527 --> 01:42:23.188]  It's bad art.
[01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:26.930]  And we know good art from bad art.
[01:42:29.739 --> 01:42:35.082]  And it's all subjective in a certain area, but not in its full spectrum.
[01:42:37.223 --> 01:42:40.004]  And they're sabotaging beauty.
[01:42:40.804 --> 01:42:50.409]  They're creating new views of beauty because they don't want you to recognize beauty because it's like a tractor beam that can suck you out of a black hole spiritually.
[01:42:52.383 --> 01:42:54.106]  I mean, hell, we sacrifice our babies.
[01:42:54.126 --> 01:42:55.167]  We kill tens of millions of them.
[01:42:55.488 --> 01:42:56.349]  All because they're not humans.
[01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:59.855]  To do that, they've got to wreck your brain so you don't know good from evil.
[01:43:00.616 --> 01:43:01.658]  You don't know light from darkness.
[01:43:09.195 --> 01:43:09.716]  Google is evil!
[01:43:09.816 --> 01:43:11.237]  Google is evil!
[01:43:11.297 --> 01:43:16.703]  Google is going to volunteer and violate the law!
[01:43:16.783 --> 01:43:18.164]  That's enough, Nick.
[01:43:18.224 --> 01:43:19.906]  Too much noise.
[01:43:20.066 --> 01:43:24.231]  I'm afraid you're just too darn loud.
[01:43:28.892 --> 01:43:40.558]  Before we delve into these questions, I must first dispense with a completely illegitimate issue, which is the fantasy dreamed up by some conservatives that Google and other online platforms have an anti-conservative bias.
[01:43:40.818 --> 01:43:42.379]  But what if Google was lying to you?
[01:43:42.419 --> 01:43:47.402]  As I've said repeatedly, no credible evidence supports this right-wing conspiracy theory.
[01:43:47.482 --> 01:43:52.745]  Here is documented proof of some Google executives wanting to tamper with searches as a form of political activism.
[01:43:52.765 --> 01:43:55.847]  When you search for a term on Google, the most popular results come into the top
[01:43:56.187 --> 01:44:05.729]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[01:44:05.789 --> 01:44:07.549]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[01:44:07.829 --> 01:44:10.890]  Does the United States need a national privacy law?
[01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:12.610]  They're gonna talk about me in this committee.
[01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:13.630]  I will be talked about.
[01:44:14.311 --> 01:44:15.371]  So what am I supposed to do?
[01:44:15.451 --> 01:44:16.491]  I don't get a day in court.
[01:44:16.911 --> 01:44:17.631]  They lie about me.
[01:44:17.671 --> 01:44:19.432]  Google only puts lies up.
[01:44:19.592 --> 01:44:21.612]  All the top searches are lies about me and my family.
[01:44:21.792 --> 01:44:26.117]  The other issue I wanted to just raise in my last minute is moderating hate speech.
[01:44:26.137 --> 01:44:26.497]  Hate speech.
[01:44:26.698 --> 01:44:27.138]  Hate speech.
[01:44:27.198 --> 01:44:27.799]  Hate speech.
[01:44:27.879 --> 01:44:28.360]  Hate speech.
[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:29.020]  Hate speech.
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:29.881]  Hate speech.
[01:44:30.041 --> 01:44:31.383]  And bullying policies.
[01:44:31.463 --> 01:44:36.509]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[01:44:36.749 --> 01:44:38.150]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[01:44:38.170 --> 01:44:39.691]  I have a right to fix my accusers.
[01:44:40.131 --> 01:44:42.472]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[01:44:42.532 --> 01:44:49.576]  This has come up in a number of different ways, and we appreciate the work that you have done, particularly with YouTube.
[01:44:49.676 --> 01:44:54.598]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier, promoting conspiracy theories.
[01:44:54.698 --> 01:44:59.761]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[01:44:59.981 --> 01:45:01.582]  We're aware of his lying to Congress.
[01:45:01.622 --> 01:45:05.985]  We're aware of him and the Dragonfly Project that's already been operational for years inside the Chinese government.
[01:45:06.265 --> 01:45:07.706]  Now it's just being rolled out to the general public.
[01:45:07.766 --> 01:45:11.928]  Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China.
[01:45:12.008 --> 01:45:12.648]  Translation?
[01:45:13.029 --> 01:45:17.251]  Google is helping China silence its political opposition.
[01:45:17.271 --> 01:45:18.132]  Google is evil!
[01:45:18.572 --> 01:45:19.612]  Google is evil!
[01:45:19.893 --> 01:45:22.514]  Google would love to have me arrested and killed.
[01:45:22.814 --> 01:45:23.415]  Guaranteed.
[01:45:30.035 --> 01:45:30.796]  InfoWars.
[01:45:30.956 --> 01:45:32.417]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:45:32.697 --> 01:45:33.798]  Round one.
[01:45:34.399 --> 01:45:35.439]  Fight Trump.
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:38.702]  The game where you deal for everything you ever wanted to own.
[01:45:38.862 --> 01:45:39.102]  Yes!
[01:45:39.263 --> 01:45:39.883]  Fight Trump.
[01:45:40.003 --> 01:45:41.264]  The game from Milton Bradley.
[01:45:41.384 --> 01:45:42.205]  I think you'll like it.
[01:45:42.225 --> 01:45:44.567]  I don't know how you feel about this, but keep a gun in your house.
[01:45:44.627 --> 01:45:48.570]  If you think someone's gonna assault you or rape you, blow their head off, man!
[01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:49.811]  Fire at them!
[01:45:50.151 --> 01:45:50.852]  Don't take it, man!
[01:45:51.172 --> 01:45:53.093]  Kenison was born in Peoria, Illinois.
[01:45:53.353 --> 01:45:57.596]  He died when a pickup truck slammed into his car near Needles, California last night.
[01:45:57.716 --> 01:46:02.819]  The body of Nirvana's lead singer and songwriter was found today in a guest cottage at his Seattle home.
[01:46:03.359 --> 01:46:07.482]  The medical examiner says he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
[01:46:07.682 --> 01:46:10.403]  All of a sudden, police brutality had a human face.
[01:46:10.683 --> 01:46:16.107]  The face belonged to Rodney King, a black male being brutally beaten and pitched by Los Angeles police officers.
[01:46:20.604 --> 01:46:22.566]  Oh, look at that.
[01:46:23.227 --> 01:46:23.707]  Terrible!
[01:46:24.048 --> 01:46:25.810]  And there's no police presence down here.
[01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:26.951]  Nobody's helping us.
[01:46:26.991 --> 01:46:28.674]  This is attempted murder.
[01:46:28.694 --> 01:46:35.702]  The three merchants walked out of the stores and they just started firing at everybody and anybody.
[01:46:43.072 --> 01:46:44.853]  That's not right!
[01:46:44.933 --> 01:46:46.374]  That's not right!
[01:46:46.434 --> 01:46:48.915]  New Mexico, what is that?
[01:46:48.955 --> 01:46:50.156]  What is going on here?
[01:46:50.196 --> 01:46:50.816]  Kicked in the head.
[01:46:51.116 --> 01:46:52.217]  He's laying in the street.
[01:46:52.237 --> 01:46:54.018]  Terrible, terrible pictures.
[01:46:54.398 --> 01:46:56.539]  All this guy did was enter this area.
[01:46:56.719 --> 01:46:57.719]  Hit the siren, Doug.
[01:47:05.884 --> 01:47:08.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:37.799 --> 01:47:39.720]  Wow, we got some good camera work going on in there.
[01:47:42.441 --> 01:47:44.481]  Syndicated Radio meets television.
[01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:45.522]  That's the InfoWars.
[01:47:45.582 --> 01:47:46.262]  Meets the truth.
[01:47:46.282 --> 01:47:47.562]  Meets tomorrow's news today.
[01:47:49.023 --> 01:47:52.164]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:47:53.464 --> 01:48:02.147]  That's where you find the most dreaded, most banned, most attacked, most lied about syndicated radio and TV programs, special news reports, you name it, on the planet.
[01:48:03.787 --> 01:48:05.088]  Because we know about the big game plan.
[01:48:05.947 --> 01:48:08.568]  And I want to be a thousand percent to infinity clear.
[01:48:10.489 --> 01:48:15.991]  I am not saying everybody in the CIA is bad or everybody, even the Democratic Party is bad.
[01:48:16.751 --> 01:48:26.534]  It's a fact that these agencies have been hijacked by multinational organizations and groups that wanted to harness the power of America and parlay it into a global government.
[01:48:27.274 --> 01:48:31.156]  Well, that global government is an anti-human technocracy and is not our friend.
[01:48:32.162 --> 01:48:37.784]  And it's so bold now that it has major news programs saying that the nation existing is evil.
[01:48:38.264 --> 01:48:40.845]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:48:40.865 --> 01:48:41.145]  Remember?
[01:48:41.405 --> 01:48:42.126]  All the different channels.
[01:48:42.186 --> 01:48:42.806]  Oh my gosh.
[01:48:43.266 --> 01:48:45.027]  Trump's saying the word nationalist.
[01:48:45.047 --> 01:48:45.687]  That's evil.
[01:48:46.287 --> 01:48:47.167]  This is crazy.
[01:48:47.207 --> 01:48:48.168]  We're being usurped.
[01:48:48.548 --> 01:48:49.508]  We're being conquered.
[01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:54.950]  And all Trump's trying to do is restore the republic.
[01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:58.891]  All he's trying to do is get the power of the people and the U.S.
[01:48:58.931 --> 01:49:00.432]  government back in control of the government.
[01:49:04.312 --> 01:49:09.973]  This whole New World Order was supposed to be American and Western power helping the world and setting up world government to stop war.
[01:49:10.593 --> 01:49:12.714]  And setting up world government to build up the third world.
[01:49:12.774 --> 01:49:21.356]  Instead, it's hold down the third world, weaponize it, use it against the first world, drive down all the wages, have a giant underclass they control, and bring in a one world government.
[01:49:21.656 --> 01:49:24.056]  This is a double-cross, big time.
[01:49:25.597 --> 01:49:31.518]  They got all the egalitarian leftists in the 50s and 60s and 70s to sign on to the world government project.
[01:49:33.285 --> 01:49:42.192]  And they tried in the 50s, 60s, and 70s to openly push world government and mainstream news, and it's a great thing, and we'll have a UN World Army, and no one else will have weapons.
[01:49:42.212 --> 01:49:44.314]  And people went, well, that's dumb.
[01:49:44.334 --> 01:49:45.735]  Then they'll be the absolute power.
[01:49:47.037 --> 01:49:49.919]  So they pulled that back because you got Ronald Reagan.
[01:49:50.119 --> 01:49:50.740]  He was against it.
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.383]  They pulled that back and said, let's just say this doesn't exist.
[01:49:55.484 --> 01:49:57.986]  But they were building it behind the scenes, and we were exposing it.
[01:49:58.366 --> 01:50:01.569]  So now that it's emerged, our credibility
[01:50:03.564 --> 01:50:03.984]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:26.741 --> 01:50:44.294]  At a big conference and they had one of the directors of a major group of the CIA there and they were just openly talking about the new world order, one world government, how America has to choose whether it's going to continue on or let the Chinese rule the planet.
[01:50:45.834 --> 01:50:51.156]  And again, it's not just InfoWars that did that, it's all of us together, but InfoWars was front and center at that.
[01:50:52.057 --> 01:51:04.943]  And half the people in the room were contractors for the NSA and CIA, and they're openly there with one of the directors, one of the directors of a major program, they asked me not to say which one, talking about InfoWars.
[01:51:05.703 --> 01:51:06.103]  Right there.
[01:51:07.284 --> 01:51:11.385]  And how we're doing the right thing, and how the government has to decide which side it's on.
[01:51:11.646 --> 01:51:13.767]  That's how cut and dry this is now, folks.
[01:51:16.834 --> 01:51:17.174]  What was that?
[01:51:17.194 --> 01:51:20.095]  That was Saturday night.
[01:51:20.955 --> 01:51:23.496]  Seems like a hundred years ago already that I was hearing about that.
[01:51:24.457 --> 01:51:25.977]  From a guy I've known since I was a little kid.
[01:51:27.678 --> 01:51:30.318]  So, not everybody's bad in the government.
[01:51:30.739 --> 01:51:32.119]  It's just this was all hidden before.
[01:51:32.539 --> 01:51:37.521]  Now it's out in the open and the decision of which side you're gonna be on here is very very cut and dry.
[01:51:39.181 --> 01:51:40.642]  So decide which side you're on, folks.
[01:51:41.062 --> 01:51:41.863]  Trump isn't perfect.
[01:51:41.923 --> 01:51:42.463]  I'm not perfect.
[01:51:42.483 --> 01:51:44.004]  Let me tell you, we care about free market.
[01:51:44.024 --> 01:51:44.884]  We care about your family.
[01:51:45.125 --> 01:51:45.985]  I care about this country.
[01:51:46.305 --> 01:51:47.586]  I care about global leadership.
[01:51:47.726 --> 01:51:48.927]  I care about not being a slave.
[01:51:49.407 --> 01:51:50.328]  I care about having a future.
[01:51:51.629 --> 01:51:52.629]  And I want to live in a free world.
[01:51:52.989 --> 01:51:53.810]  As free as we can live in.
[01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:55.731]  And that's all been thrown down the toilet.
[01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:57.392]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:51:58.273 --> 01:51:59.653]  Nick and Johnny and everybody else.
[01:51:59.673 --> 01:52:00.954]  We're going to take calls all through the next hour.
[01:52:01.735 --> 01:52:03.816]  Nick in Michigan, thank you for holding her on the air.
[01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:06.811]  Hi Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[01:52:07.191 --> 01:52:09.811]  Thank you for everything you do, everything the crew does.
[01:52:10.031 --> 01:52:10.532]  Thank you, brother.
[01:52:10.632 --> 01:52:12.552]  I just wanted to plug a few products.
[01:52:12.632 --> 01:52:17.594]  Infowarslife.com, big supporter of the ultimate fish oil, probably the best stuff on the market.
[01:52:17.634 --> 01:52:20.274]  Survival Shield, male-female vitality.
[01:52:20.334 --> 01:52:22.695]  I just ordered some more of the Super Blue Chloride free toothpaste.
[01:52:24.363 --> 01:52:31.586]  I just wanted to, my call, if you want, subject is something would be, what could be our plan of action to stop the 5G in geoengineering?
[01:52:32.326 --> 01:52:36.427]  A site I usually reference back to is geoengineeringwatch.org.
[01:52:36.547 --> 01:52:40.569]  I don't know if you could pull it up on my phone call if you search in.
[01:52:41.449 --> 01:52:43.250]  Total ozone layer collapse.
[01:52:43.570 --> 01:52:45.691]  Geoengineering Watch, that article, will pull up.
[01:52:46.071 --> 01:52:53.854]  And I think the two main things that we can, if we can repeat this, constantly get it out to the people that listen to us, we can push this issue to the forefront.
[01:52:54.194 --> 01:52:56.655]  First one is ozone layer depletion.
[01:52:56.675 --> 01:53:01.277]  The second is the detection of ground-level ultraviolet C radiation.
[01:53:01.857 --> 01:53:09.460]  And they sound like science-y terms, but once people look into these two things on Geoengineering Watch, it's all sourced, I think we start to find out that
[01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:12.992]  We don't have as much time here as we think as a race.
[01:53:13.152 --> 01:53:20.116]  Maybe less than 10 years before the ozone layer completely collapses and we have to almost terraform and move underground.
[01:53:20.996 --> 01:53:27.040]  So just wondering, I guess, what you think we could do as a plan of action, maybe to initiate Trump and stopping this stuff.
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:39.489]  There's also a video I saw online of Trump watching a demonstration of 5G, and he almost approved it, you know, it almost seemed like Trump was happy with the promises of the technology, and I'm a Trump supporter.
[01:53:39.749 --> 01:53:47.295]  Well, Trump's very, he's smart in ways, but he's 72, and he just loves technology and innovation, and all he does is go around cheerleading, you know, stuff being built.
[01:53:48.035 --> 01:53:50.858]  And Trump just thinks, well, if we're putting it up, it must be okay.
[01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:53.900]  Let me boil down what you're saying as best I can.
[01:53:55.001 --> 01:53:56.322]  It's not just Geoengineering Watch.
[01:53:56.943 --> 01:53:58.324]  It's the UN's own documents.
[01:53:58.464 --> 01:54:04.970]  It's admitted that there is a planetary race by different governments to control the weather.
[01:54:06.131 --> 01:54:10.154]  And that there is a lot of electromagnetic radiation being fired up from antenna farms.
[01:54:10.434 --> 01:54:11.555]  Here's two articles just today.
[01:54:11.976 --> 01:54:14.278]  China and Russia are working together to heat the atmosphere.
[01:54:15.233 --> 01:54:15.693]  Here's another one.
[01:54:15.733 --> 01:54:18.934]  China and Russia perform controversial experiments to modify the atmosphere.
[01:54:19.294 --> 01:54:20.834]  It was just decades after the U.S.
[01:54:20.874 --> 01:54:21.294]  was doing it.
[01:54:21.935 --> 01:54:25.976]  And so we try to have a debate about this, and they go, oh, none of it's going on.
[01:54:26.016 --> 01:54:27.116]  So they don't want us discussing it.
[01:54:27.136 --> 01:54:29.316]  But now, more and more it's out in the open.
[01:54:29.336 --> 01:54:30.837]  Bill and Melinda Gates are heavily involved.
[01:54:31.377 --> 01:54:35.558]  And when you talk to top astrophysicists and atmosphere experts, they tell you,
[01:54:37.182 --> 01:54:52.614]  What they're finding being shot up into the atmosphere is cooking out the atmosphere and the type of barium salts, aluminum dioxide and other things that are clearly being injected into the atmosphere are causing an atmospheric collapse.
[01:54:53.215 --> 01:55:01.742]  Then you cut out carbon dioxide with all these global regulations when it's a cleaning, earth-giving gas that's only a trace gas and the lowest it's ever been recorded.
[01:55:03.697 --> 01:55:04.357]  They say it's up.
[01:55:04.437 --> 01:55:04.918]  It's not.
[01:55:04.978 --> 01:55:06.438]  It used to be hundreds of times stronger.
[01:55:06.458 --> 01:55:10.959]  This looks like an attempt to collapse the atmosphere, according to real science.
[01:55:11.019 --> 01:55:13.580]  And so we know there's big secret projects.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:14.641]  We know what's going on.
[01:55:14.901 --> 01:55:17.121]  The Earth is being not geoengineered.
[01:55:17.141 --> 01:55:18.342]  It's being terraformed.
[01:55:18.822 --> 01:55:24.063]  And we don't know exactly what the master plan is or what the endgame is, but it's going on.
[01:55:24.544 --> 01:55:26.624]  And there's talking points that go out against me.
[01:55:27.524 --> 01:55:30.225]  There's nothing in the water that reduces your fertility.
[01:55:30.245 --> 01:55:31.226]  Of course, there is.
[01:55:34.110 --> 01:55:38.031]  They also say, Muslims don't want to hurt you, they're perfect, open your arms.
[01:55:38.632 --> 01:55:44.394]  And they also say, Jones is crazy, there's nothing being sprayed in the atmosphere, there's no such thing as weather modification.
[01:55:44.834 --> 01:55:49.696]  And you'll see the talk show hosts, the big podcasters, they will just say that as a script.
[01:55:50.676 --> 01:55:53.377]  Because these are the big things they don't want being looked into.
[01:55:53.617 --> 01:55:54.498]  And then here's the big secret.
[01:55:56.598 --> 01:56:00.260]  I guarantee you, the globalists think they can start collapsing the atmosphere and then bring it back.
[01:56:01.527 --> 01:56:04.609]  They'll get a bunch of funding out of this when it does start to fully collapse.
[01:56:05.050 --> 01:56:08.132]  And they'll say, oh my gosh, see our over-industry did this.
[01:56:08.493 --> 01:56:10.094]  We need a global government to regulate this.
[01:56:10.154 --> 01:56:11.175]  It's a planetary crisis.
[01:56:11.675 --> 01:56:12.896]  Everyone must come together.
[01:56:13.296 --> 01:56:14.697]  The atmosphere started to collapse.
[01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:27.256]  See, environmentalism's real, let us have carbon taxes, let us run your life, when they're the ones, clearly according to science, that are running covert programs, much of them public now, to collapse the atmosphere.
[01:56:27.296 --> 01:56:28.157]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:56:28.757 --> 01:56:35.360]  Experts across the board agree they are doing things that could only hurt the atmosphere while they're claiming they're trying to defend it.
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:36.921]  So what do you think's behind this?
[01:56:37.021 --> 01:56:39.502]  I think they're triggering its partial collapse
[01:56:40.262 --> 01:56:40.422]  Nope.
[01:56:56.448 --> 01:56:57.768]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:56:57.828 --> 01:57:02.290]  I think the reason I mentioned the 5G is I think they're so tied in hand in hand.
[01:57:02.330 --> 01:57:06.471]  I think the, you know, the way everything on the ground affecting what's up in the sky.
[01:57:07.411 --> 01:57:11.392]  Sir, it's a fact 5G absolutely gives you cancer just a year around it.
[01:57:11.652 --> 01:57:13.973]  It vibrates your DNA at the exact frequency to break it.
[01:57:14.373 --> 01:57:23.055]  And I've interviewed folks that are experts on this and they put me in touch with people off record who worked putting up the so-called Doppler radar that we all have to see the weather.
[01:57:23.855 --> 01:57:25.195]  That's only one part of it.
[01:57:25.235 --> 01:57:28.476]  They have larger power arrays that they can turn on.
[01:57:28.496 --> 01:57:35.377]  And this is a hidden network of these ionizers that the Russians admit they have to basically microwave the atmosphere.
[01:57:36.677 --> 01:57:38.298]  Shout out to a former guest of yours, Alex.
[01:57:38.698 --> 01:57:39.018]  Pardon me?
[01:57:39.878 --> 01:57:44.139]  Could I give a shout out to a former guest of yours, the rapper Prodigy?
[01:57:44.579 --> 01:57:51.000]  He actually put out his last musical album that he put out was called the Hegelian Dialectic.
[01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:51.620]  Very exciting.
[01:57:52.918 --> 01:57:59.385]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:58:01.087 --> 01:58:02.528]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:58:02.768 --> 01:58:07.693]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide 50 to 75% off double Patriot points.
[01:58:08.866 --> 01:58:14.788]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:58:15.548 --> 01:58:21.630]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale.
[01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:23.211]  You'll get a free gift
[01:58:23.991 --> 01:58:50.163]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[01:58:51.403 --> 01:58:57.726]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[01:58:58.186 --> 01:58:59.907]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[01:58:59.987 --> 01:59:04.929]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, B.S.
[01:59:05.370 --> 01:59:05.910]  It's big.
[01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:06.850]  It's bad.
[01:59:07.271 --> 01:59:12.493]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[01:59:12.513 --> 01:59:14.814]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[01:59:15.234 --> 01:59:18.436]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[01:59:19.057 --> 01:59:20.020]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:59:20.041 --> 01:59:21.225]  That's been going on for over a month.
[01:59:21.988 --> 01:59:23.213]  50 to 75% off.
[01:59:23.233 --> 01:59:24.258]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[01:59:25.319 --> 01:59:26.239]  The Double Patriot points.
[01:59:26.279 --> 01:59:27.179]  That's what happened in about a week.
[01:59:27.539 --> 01:59:34.161]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[01:59:34.621 --> 01:59:39.002]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:39.022 --> 01:59:40.902]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:59:41.162 --> 01:59:42.982]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:59:43.162 --> 01:59:45.223]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:45.383 --> 01:59:49.404]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[01:59:56.900 --> 02:00:00.813]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:26.724 --> 02:00:32.587]  All right.
[02:00:32.667 --> 02:00:44.251]  That was another great caller.
[02:00:44.271 --> 02:00:45.152]  Took a whole segment, though.
[02:00:45.532 --> 02:00:46.452]  Let's go to the next caller.
[02:00:46.532 --> 02:00:47.553]  Johnny in Canada.
[02:00:48.133 --> 02:00:48.833]  Johnny, you're on the air.
[02:00:48.873 --> 02:00:49.453]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:50.794 --> 02:00:52.755]  Johnny is here.
[02:00:52.775 --> 02:00:53.735]  Merry Christmas, Alex.
[02:00:54.315 --> 02:00:54.736]  Hey, brother.
[02:00:54.756 --> 02:00:55.456]  Merry Christmas to you.
[02:00:56.618 --> 02:01:02.663]  Yeah, there's one thing I called last week, and I wanted to say to Gavin, you never get the war you want, and this is the war we don't want.
[02:01:05.806 --> 02:01:09.409]  I sent some email about two weeks ago to you.
[02:01:09.809 --> 02:01:12.391]  Yellow Vest protests have started in Canada.
[02:01:15.213 --> 02:01:22.940]  Basically what happened was, we've had them in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Ottawa.
[02:01:23.473 --> 02:01:24.733]  Ottawa and FIFA showed up.
[02:01:24.813 --> 02:01:26.514]  They started creating a whole whack of stuff.
[02:01:27.054 --> 02:01:31.695]  We had more Yellow Vests protests last week, this recent weekend in Toronto.
[02:01:32.555 --> 02:01:40.216]  And, yeah, it's... If you look at global news here in Canada, they're saying it's in solidarity with the French.
[02:01:40.276 --> 02:01:40.716]  It's not.
[02:01:40.796 --> 02:01:47.318]  It's like they're protesting the whole UN migration pact and... I don't know, man.
[02:01:47.478 --> 02:01:48.498]  It's crazy.
[02:01:51.576 --> 02:01:52.577]  I'm glad you raised that.
[02:01:52.637 --> 02:01:58.763]  Guys, can you print me, for radio listeners, they have a CTV news story there on screen.
[02:01:58.783 --> 02:02:00.485]  Can you guys put that back up?
[02:02:00.525 --> 02:02:00.845]  Thanks.
[02:02:01.426 --> 02:02:09.494]  That shows people are indeed protesting that the UN is trying to abolish borders, that the UN is bringing in global government.
[02:02:10.302 --> 02:02:15.026]  Yellow Vest protests spread to Canada criticizing illegal immigration and taxes.
[02:02:15.807 --> 02:02:18.929]  And that really shows the power of the establishment media.
[02:02:19.009 --> 02:02:22.932]  At first, five weeks ago, when these things started, they said, oh, it's about a gas tax.
[02:02:22.952 --> 02:02:30.779]  But they were actually people mad about open borders, mad about globalism, mad about loss of sovereignty to the EU.
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:38.906]  And now they go, oh, and mainstream media, oh, they've just turned into these anti-globalization protesters.
[02:02:39.948 --> 02:02:40.149]  No.
[02:02:40.689 --> 02:02:41.890]  They were that from the beginning.
[02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:48.377]  And then some media is bemoaning, oh my gosh, some concerned media, some of these are socialists who don't want to lose their pension funds.
[02:02:48.417 --> 02:02:49.538]  Well, I've already said that.
[02:02:50.099 --> 02:02:50.699]  Do the research.
[02:02:51.644 --> 02:03:05.480]  These coalition governments from Spain to Italy to other areas that are overthrowing the globalists, they're leftists that are figuring out, and liberals that are about to lose their pension fund, that that's part of the globalist plan to bankrupt their country.
[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:09.424]  So they're going, oh my gosh, I'm for sovereignty, I'm for national borders, I'm for culture.
[02:03:09.464 --> 02:03:09.724]  Good!
[02:03:10.325 --> 02:03:12.587]  Maybe you'll wake up and become a conservative or a nationalist.
[02:03:12.947 --> 02:03:14.148]  But it's the first step.
[02:03:14.208 --> 02:03:18.131]  So if we get the left on our side and wake them up, that's a good thing.
[02:03:18.191 --> 02:03:23.454]  It shows that globalism is so unpopular that their own brainwashed sheep are joining us.
[02:03:23.515 --> 02:03:24.495]  That's what scares them.
[02:03:24.856 --> 02:03:26.457]  Soros and all the globalists.
[02:03:27.318 --> 02:03:27.818]  Yeah, and Alex, like, the
[02:03:57.028 --> 02:04:05.572]  They're talking about us, like, saying, yeah, we're in solidarity with the French, but yet they're waving flags saying, flush the turd in 2019.
[02:04:06.012 --> 02:04:12.595]  And we're talking about Trudeau and his Soros-linked group.
[02:04:12.615 --> 02:04:17.897]  Yeah, and if you look at WikiLeaks, he's very well linked to the Clintons as well.
[02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:25.147]  Oh yeah, well that's like Hillary's nickname is Crooked Hillary, and you've got a nickname for Michael Cohen's The Rat.
[02:04:25.227 --> 02:04:29.089]  I mean, Trudeau's, I'm told his nickname is Turd, correct?
[02:04:30.070 --> 02:04:30.510]  Correct.
[02:04:31.530 --> 02:04:34.011]  And yeah, they're going after our guns full board this time.
[02:04:35.852 --> 02:04:36.913]  I'm doing what I gotta do.
[02:04:37.453 --> 02:04:38.994]  I'm pulling my AR out of the safe.
[02:04:39.674 --> 02:04:40.354]  I'm cleaning it up.
[02:04:40.414 --> 02:04:43.816]  I'm taking an American veteran shooting on Wednesday.
[02:04:45.457 --> 02:04:47.438]  Well brother, the answer is taking your country back.
[02:04:48.268 --> 02:04:50.570]  Because the globalist-controlled leftists are always going to push for more power.
[02:04:50.590 --> 02:05:00.699]  And I'm glad you raised that point, because I saw some of the news about the yellow vests spreading there to Canada, and I've seen the video and photos that does show they're nationalists, not just people in solidarity with France.
[02:05:00.739 --> 02:05:01.100]  Great point.
[02:05:03.598 --> 02:05:12.889]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:12.929 --> 02:05:15.212]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:15.813 --> 02:05:21.880]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:22.541 --> 02:05:28.384]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:28.844 --> 02:05:34.447]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:35.147 --> 02:05:42.131]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:43.271 --> 02:05:55.815]  Kim, a scientist and others, showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:56.336 --> 02:06:00.097]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:06:00.617 --> 02:06:03.318]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[02:06:09.282 --> 02:06:19.467]  All right, we're going right back to your phone calls.
[02:06:20.627 --> 02:06:29.252]  But I wanted to play a clip of Dr. Ron Paul, former congressman, saying a 50% correction will spark depression-like conditions that may be worse than 1929.
[02:06:29.712 --> 02:06:31.813]  And I want to just say something.
[02:06:33.064 --> 02:06:44.789]  I wholeheartedly agree that that would spark conditions worse than 1929 because, well I'll tell you after we play this clip, why it would spark conditions worse than 1929 and then go to your calls.
[02:06:45.549 --> 02:06:47.770]  So we're going to play back to back because they tie together.
[02:06:50.271 --> 02:06:53.112]  Ron Paul's clip and then Schumer.
[02:06:53.933 --> 02:06:58.295]  Trump's temper tantrum over wall funding is leading to government shutdown.
[02:06:58.675 --> 02:07:01.356]  They won't even do basic border funding, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:02.329 --> 02:07:04.410]  We got 10 times the people trying to get in right now.
[02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:07.233]  The Democrats with the UN have organized this assault.
[02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:11.395]  The one thing the federal government's supposed to do is coin the money and protect the borders.
[02:07:12.576 --> 02:07:13.137]  It's just crazy.
[02:07:13.157 --> 02:07:17.680]  So we're going to play those clips back to back and then go right back to your phone calls.
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:21.843]  On the downturn that you're forecasting in the market, how bad do you think it'll be?
[02:07:22.303 --> 02:07:25.526]  Looking back in terms of history, is there anything you can compare it to?
[02:07:27.747 --> 02:07:28.047]  Well...
[02:07:29.093 --> 02:07:32.794]  You know, I just think there's no sign that it's going to be mild.
[02:07:33.874 --> 02:07:35.534]  And it depends on what the government does.
[02:07:35.594 --> 02:07:37.755]  If you allow the liquidation, it doesn't last long.
[02:07:38.155 --> 02:07:40.995]  I would advocate, you know, allowing it to liquidate itself like in 1921.
[02:07:41.055 --> 02:07:44.376]  No, I think it could be worse in 1929.
[02:07:44.856 --> 02:07:48.197]  And because we can't keep our hands off, we prop it up.
[02:07:48.497 --> 02:07:49.757]  It's like taking drugs.
[02:07:50.037 --> 02:07:53.938]  And I think all this QE bailout was just loading up on the drugs.
[02:07:54.038 --> 02:07:56.298]  It was so dependent on free money.
[02:07:56.719 --> 02:07:58.899]  But unfortunately, what happens
[02:07:59.199 --> 02:07:59.659]  We're good to go.
[02:08:14.946 --> 02:08:17.587]  Look at the terrible situation we have here.
[02:08:18.187 --> 02:08:23.910]  And that is the reason why I think it's so important to understand the original cause of the problem.
[02:08:24.230 --> 02:08:33.213]  And that is the Federal Reserve running up debt and letting politicians spend money and having conservatives, when they get in office and control the government, they're worse than the Democrats.
[02:08:33.553 --> 02:08:36.735]  Because they're totally dependent on it.
[02:08:37.577 --> 02:08:44.319]  President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall in the House or the Senate.
[02:08:44.399 --> 02:08:47.459]  He is not going to get the wall in any form.
[02:08:48.059 --> 02:08:54.201]  Even the House, which is a majority Republican, they don't have the votes for his $5 billion wall plan.
[02:08:54.221 --> 02:09:02.283]  In fact, Ryan, afraid of what's going to happen, sent all the House home until Wednesday night, a day and a half before, two days before the shutdown.
[02:09:02.563 --> 02:09:04.963]  And they certainly don't have the votes in the Senate.
[02:09:05.384 --> 02:09:07.024]  Now, we Democrats,
[02:09:07.244 --> 02:09:13.725]  Leader Pelosi and I offered the President two options as to how to avoid the shutdown.
[02:09:14.105 --> 02:09:23.407]  And we should not let a temper tantrum, threats, push us in the direction of doing something that everybody, even our Republican colleagues, know is wrong.
[02:09:23.427 --> 02:09:24.987]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[02:09:25.307 --> 02:09:30.308]  It's not a temper tantrum to try to follow through on your promise when it's constitutional.
[02:09:30.328 --> 02:09:34.689]  And when you guys came to the meeting and you were the ones that were arrogant and mean and rude, it's pure bull.
[02:09:35.816 --> 02:09:42.301]  Remember, he even agreed to let some DACA recipients, if they could prove they weren't criminal, stay here.
[02:09:44.122 --> 02:09:45.584]  And they said, no, we want everything.
[02:09:45.604 --> 02:09:47.365]  He said, okay, let's have some gun control.
[02:09:47.385 --> 02:09:48.446]  They said, we want everything banned.
[02:09:49.226 --> 02:09:50.567]  He did that, by the way, on purpose.
[02:09:50.587 --> 02:09:52.549]  That's a tactic, I don't know, a fact.
[02:09:53.530 --> 02:09:55.291]  That he'll tell them, okay, what do you want?
[02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:57.393]  To get them to say, ban all the guns.
[02:09:57.453 --> 02:09:58.093]  That was the plan.
[02:09:58.874 --> 02:10:01.656]  Certain person I know had a meeting with the President and told him to try that.
[02:10:01.816 --> 02:10:02.497]  And the President did it.
[02:10:03.718 --> 02:10:03.918]  So...
[02:10:07.449 --> 02:10:08.529]  We're gonna go back to your phone calls.
[02:10:08.569 --> 02:10:09.970]  Let me just make the point about the economy.
[02:10:18.453 --> 02:10:22.195]  10% of the people in this nation now live in rural agrarian areas.
[02:10:22.995 --> 02:10:24.055]  In true farming areas.
[02:10:25.036 --> 02:10:27.076]  And about half of them are farming.
[02:10:28.317 --> 02:10:29.557]  And are somewhat self-sufficient.
[02:10:29.597 --> 02:10:33.099]  So 5% are self-sufficient. 95%
[02:10:40.535 --> 02:10:44.018]  are not self-sufficient.
[02:10:44.339 --> 02:10:49.243]  95% are not self-sufficient.
[02:10:51.986 --> 02:11:01.315]  So if there is a collapse in civilization, if there is a stock market plunge, we will get the collapse of civilization.
[02:11:01.715 --> 02:11:02.956]  I was putting the carpet for the horse here.
[02:11:04.218 --> 02:11:05.479]  And that's what Ron Paul is saying.
[02:11:06.479 --> 02:11:07.820]  And I don't have to go into the whole story.
[02:11:07.940 --> 02:11:10.982]  Everybody remembers their grandpa or their great-grandpa or their dad.
[02:11:12.203 --> 02:11:16.907]  My dad grew up where they had a farm and they had a ranch because you had to do both to make it.
[02:11:17.207 --> 02:11:24.533]  And most of them had jobs in town as teachers or at feedlots or as doctors.
[02:11:26.674 --> 02:11:32.279]  And still people to pay the taxes and keep their employees hired and run things.
[02:11:33.575 --> 02:11:36.477]  But I mean, I remember my grandfather out there working on the combine.
[02:11:37.938 --> 02:11:40.240]  They were really proud about how, oh, we don't have money to buy a part.
[02:11:41.261 --> 02:11:45.524]  We'll just put a Pepsi can in here as the oil filter till the part comes in.
[02:11:46.104 --> 02:11:47.626]  Or just all sorts of stuff they would do.
[02:11:48.746 --> 02:11:56.532]  And my dad still knows how to do electricity work, and he knows how to... He knows how to do basically anything, and his dad could do even more than he could.
[02:11:57.593 --> 02:12:01.276]  There wasn't a plumber, there wasn't an electrician, there wasn't a gunsmith, there was daddy.
[02:12:04.918 --> 02:12:06.379]  And now that's all gone.
[02:12:06.399 --> 02:12:09.821]  I mean, my dad's dad knew how to grow anything.
[02:12:12.203 --> 02:12:14.404]  He knew how to shoot and clean and eat anything.
[02:12:19.408 --> 02:12:20.408]  And all those people are gone.
[02:12:20.428 --> 02:12:26.453]  That's why when people bring Mexicans up here and they go, man, these people are handy.
[02:12:26.493 --> 02:12:27.253]  They can know how to do anything.
[02:12:27.593 --> 02:12:29.855]  Yeah, because they're right off the farm, folks.
[02:12:30.735 --> 02:12:31.416]  Right off the farm.
[02:12:33.824 --> 02:12:34.545]  That's what it's like.
[02:12:34.725 --> 02:12:36.747]  People, oh, just some dumb farmers.
[02:12:37.187 --> 02:12:38.048]  Farmers aren't dumb.
[02:12:38.449 --> 02:12:39.229]  They're survivors.
[02:12:39.269 --> 02:12:40.551]  You got to do a lot of work.
[02:12:41.111 --> 02:12:41.992]  But they liked it.
[02:12:44.494 --> 02:12:51.761]  Have you ever watched agrarian farm groups do their farming or their picking?
[02:12:51.861 --> 02:12:58.768]  They're into it because that's what you've been doing since you're a little kid and it's ancestral and people are built to do it.
[02:13:00.922 --> 02:13:07.987]  And you have a collapse of the stock market and this just-in-time delivery systems and all the rest of it, with the third world already collapsing?
[02:13:11.249 --> 02:13:11.849]  It's a time bomb.
[02:13:12.169 --> 02:13:26.519]  All right, I promise we're gonna go to break and come back and just bam, bam, bam, go to Mickey, go to Tyler and Carlos and James, but I've only got to give each caller about a minute, but please stay there because I want to hear from you all about what you think about the job Trump's doing, what happens if he fails,
[02:13:27.472 --> 02:13:36.635]  Good things are happening, bad things are happening, but I want to get your take on this because it's such an incredible time to be alive in this society and this civilization.
[02:13:38.536 --> 02:13:45.438]  Also, we're going to have hosting the fourth hour, one of my favorite guest hosts, and that is Gerald Cilente.
[02:13:47.739 --> 02:13:49.480]  But my final plug of the day is this.
[02:13:57.981 --> 02:14:01.784]  Sees the general public as just being in the way of their decision-making processes.
[02:14:02.465 --> 02:14:03.205]  They're the elites.
[02:14:03.425 --> 02:14:04.406]  They know how to run things.
[02:14:04.807 --> 02:14:08.530]  You being informed is just an impediment to what they're doing because they already know best.
[02:14:08.830 --> 02:14:09.690]  So just get out of the way.
[02:14:10.691 --> 02:14:20.019]  Either try to join them and carry out their operations or be destroyed.
[02:14:22.100 --> 02:14:26.444]  And I remember 20 years ago having some pretty powerful people and 10 years ago, you name it.
[02:14:27.921 --> 02:14:30.363]  Say, Jones, the public doesn't want to be free.
[02:14:31.144 --> 02:14:33.446]  And you'll find that you really can't change things.
[02:14:34.347 --> 02:14:35.468]  And in the end, they're going to destroy you.
[02:14:35.648 --> 02:14:37.429]  Well, now we have changed things.
[02:14:38.110 --> 02:14:40.852]  And we've helped build a global opposition to the New World Order.
[02:14:41.152 --> 02:14:43.274]  And we've got better ideas that have been proven to work.
[02:14:43.394 --> 02:14:46.897]  And now, actually, a lot of people in the power structure are actually listening.
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:51.141]  And that's why we've got to be destroyed.
[02:14:51.942 --> 02:14:55.485]  Because this system got everybody else to join it, saying, look at our
[02:14:56.812 --> 02:14:57.273]  Outcomes.
[02:14:57.413 --> 02:14:58.334]  Look at what we deliver.
[02:14:59.555 --> 02:15:04.039]  But folks are now going, you actually deliver some really bad stuff.
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:07.663]  And you've been mismanaging things on purpose to consolidate power.
[02:15:07.723 --> 02:15:08.564]  You lied to us.
[02:15:09.064 --> 02:15:11.387]  And the outcomes you claim you were going to get, you didn't do.
[02:15:11.747 --> 02:15:13.629]  So maybe we're going to join Alex Jones.
[02:15:14.109 --> 02:15:16.572]  And I don't build myself up, but that's become the logo.
[02:15:16.612 --> 02:15:17.873]  It's become the symbol.
[02:15:19.395 --> 02:15:20.416]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:15:21.653 --> 02:15:22.393]  I wasn't right.
[02:15:22.614 --> 02:15:27.796]  I was repeating what Ron Paul and Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan said and Larry McDonald.
[02:15:27.896 --> 02:15:28.877]  They were right.
[02:15:29.977 --> 02:15:31.158]  I didn't dig this up.
[02:15:31.298 --> 02:15:32.399]  I didn't invent this.
[02:15:33.259 --> 02:15:36.160]  I was just a young, aggressive person that would carry the football.
[02:15:37.081 --> 02:15:38.622]  And now, people know the truth.
[02:15:40.403 --> 02:15:43.324]  And so now, we've got to be built up as a straw man and destroyed.
[02:15:44.325 --> 02:15:45.885]  Because they don't want you to believe in this.
[02:15:45.905 --> 02:15:50.548]  They don't want you to feel that destiny you've got in your hands if you take it.
[02:15:51.872 --> 02:15:54.455]  But they're too late because so many people see through their crap.
[02:15:54.976 --> 02:15:57.479]  So all I ask you to do is pray for InfoWars.
[02:15:57.539 --> 02:15:59.241]  Please, pray for InfoWars.
[02:15:59.261 --> 02:15:59.782]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:06.025 --> 02:16:12.047]  Let me show you how the globalists push propaganda to convince the human race to commit suicide.
[02:16:12.307 --> 02:16:24.452]  For years anyone who dared mention the word chemtrails was mocked as a lunatic or a conspiracy theorist and now the synonymous term geoengineering is found throughout the scientific literature.
[02:16:24.532 --> 02:16:35.196]  You see it advocated by scientists now on a daily basis as a solution to climate change and global warming and they are openly advocating the spraying of the atmosphere with pollutants.
[02:16:35.196 --> 02:16:35.876]  We're good to go!
[02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:23.012]  Spraying at very high altitudes sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere in order to dim the Sun They want to partially block out the Sun and they propose building an entire new fleet of aircraft with Specialization just to spray this pollution all around the world now you and I would call sulfur dioxide small
[02:17:23.292 --> 02:17:27.633]  And even the EPA says that sulfur dioxide is a toxin and makes it difficult to breathe.
[02:17:27.813 --> 02:17:31.214]  If you have enough sulfur dioxide in the air, you will asphyxiate and die.
[02:17:31.254 --> 02:17:34.475]  In fact, all mammals will, because sulfur dioxide is a poison.
[02:17:34.575 --> 02:17:36.675]  So why are they altering the atmosphere?
[02:17:36.795 --> 02:17:46.738]  Why are they wanting to spray this by running 4,000 flights a year, with a proposed cost of $2.25 billion a year, in order to spray this pollution into the upper atmosphere?
[02:17:46.838 --> 02:17:49.838]  The answer is, terraforming operations are underway.
[02:17:49.978 --> 02:17:51.979]  They are terraforming planet Earth.
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:53.941]  They're altering the atmosphere.
[02:17:54.081 --> 02:18:03.605]  And if you look at the implications of this sun dimming, this global dimming that they want to create, the implications are catastrophic for the survival of the human race.
[02:18:03.905 --> 02:18:08.387]  One of them that you need to know right up front is the depletion of oxygen from the atmosphere.
[02:18:08.387 --> 02:18:08.587]  We're good
[02:18:24.514 --> 02:18:28.277]  It will, if allowed to continue, it will asphyxiate humans.
[02:18:28.517 --> 02:18:33.561]  It will create Earth as a habitat that is not survivable by human beings.
[02:18:33.601 --> 02:18:35.223]  They are altering the atmosphere.
[02:18:35.283 --> 02:18:36.524]  They are altering our planet.
[02:18:36.664 --> 02:18:38.185]  They are terraforming planet Earth.
[02:18:38.265 --> 02:18:43.810]  The globalists know that the most effective way to destroy humanity and literally exterminate the human race is to cut off the oxygen.
[02:18:43.950 --> 02:18:45.291]  And that's what this plan is doing.
[02:18:45.351 --> 02:18:49.094]  So if you spray sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, and you keep doing it enough,
[02:18:49.635 --> 02:18:50.356]  You dim the sun.
[02:18:50.376 --> 02:18:51.519]  Now, just a review here.
[02:18:51.739 --> 02:18:52.361]  You dim the sun.
[02:18:52.381 --> 02:18:54.165]  You slow the metabolism of plants.
[02:18:54.526 --> 02:18:55.789]  Plants produce less oxygen.
[02:18:56.190 --> 02:18:57.092]  Oxygen levels drop.
[02:18:57.794 --> 02:18:59.457]  The world asphyxiates.
[02:19:00.516 --> 02:19:03.218]  If you continue that enough, and that is part of the plan.
[02:19:03.438 --> 02:19:04.899]  This is why I call this terraforming.
[02:19:04.959 --> 02:19:06.960]  You have to pollute the planet to save the planet.
[02:19:06.980 --> 02:19:08.321]  Well, that makes no sense, does it?
[02:19:08.381 --> 02:19:11.163]  When they say climate change, it's because they want to change the climate.
[02:19:11.263 --> 02:19:12.444]  They want to change the atmosphere.
[02:19:12.504 --> 02:19:15.566]  They want to chemically alter the atmosphere and exterminate human beings.
[02:19:15.606 --> 02:19:19.549]  So we are fighting for much more than just geopolitical liberty.
[02:19:19.589 --> 02:19:21.430]  We're fighting for the future of the human race.
[02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:26.453]  They want to murder every human being on the planet, and they figured out how to do it.
[02:19:26.533 --> 02:19:30.316]  They convinced the millennials and the liberals that poisoning the planet is saving the planet.
[02:19:30.496 --> 02:19:35.618]  And then everybody goes along with it and says, yeah, let's save our planet as they're committing mass suicide.
[02:19:35.718 --> 02:19:46.343]  We must stop these mad scientists and we must stop these globalists using every legal means at our disposal or we, the human race, will cease to exist.
[02:19:47.003 --> 02:19:49.364]  They will exterminate us if we allow them to.
[02:19:50.444 --> 02:19:53.566]  Don't surrender to the globalists or we lose forever.
[02:19:53.646 --> 02:19:55.446]  We lose our future.
[02:19:55.506 --> 02:19:56.247]  We lose our planet.
[02:19:56.567 --> 02:19:57.727]  We lose our grandchildren.
[02:19:57.747 --> 02:19:58.688]  We lose our gene pool.
[02:19:58.748 --> 02:19:59.108]  It's over.
[02:20:06.380 --> 02:20:09.121]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.463 --> 02:20:31.368]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss, another flash,
[02:20:38.692 --> 02:20:49.276]  I'm going to your phone calls, but man, this new story at InfoWars.com by Jamie White is unbelievable.
[02:20:54.637 --> 02:20:55.558]  Jonathan Gruber.
[02:20:55.878 --> 02:20:57.038]  You know, I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:20:57.118 --> 02:20:58.358]  I'm just going to leave this later.
[02:20:59.959 --> 02:21:01.840]  And then I've got that other story I didn't get into.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:11.905]  That deals with the CIA running the local newspapers in the US to attack Infowars and to attack any other Trump supporters.
[02:21:11.965 --> 02:21:12.926]  But this is incredible.
[02:21:15.468 --> 02:21:23.334]  Jonathan Gruber, the guy that said he was hired to help deceive the American people and think God we're stupid.
[02:21:24.334 --> 02:21:26.936]  The headline's pretty strong, but it's not the right headline.
[02:21:26.956 --> 02:21:30.639]  When you actually read the article, Obamacare architect claims
[02:21:34.091 --> 02:21:36.555]  Supreme Court doesn't understand Constitution.
[02:21:40.019 --> 02:21:41.301]  I guess that is the right headline.
[02:21:41.381 --> 02:21:47.269]  It's just... Jonathan Gruber goes to the next level of deception.
[02:21:48.751 --> 02:21:51.495]  How do you look at such an arrogant whopper of a statement?
[02:21:54.437 --> 02:22:04.881]  And knowing the Supreme Court set to overturn Obamacare, and a federal court just overturned it, obviously you can't make somebody buy a private product because then it jacks up the prices.
[02:22:09.883 --> 02:22:11.904]  And it's got so many constitutional problems.
[02:22:12.304 --> 02:22:19.447]  He now says the Supreme Court doesn't understand the Constitution like he does when he helped write it.
[02:22:22.813 --> 02:22:24.253]  And I don't even think Gruber's a lawyer.
[02:22:25.194 --> 02:22:27.294]  Boy, I tell you, this guy has got some B.S.
[02:22:27.615 --> 02:22:27.955]  on him.
[02:22:28.055 --> 02:22:29.875]  I mean, this is Mr. Chutzpah.
[02:22:29.935 --> 02:22:32.696]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:22:33.176 --> 02:22:36.978]  The Supreme Court clearly doesn't represent constitutional expertise.
[02:22:38.558 --> 02:22:39.398]  That's a quote!
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:45.500]  Man, this dude is next level!
[02:22:46.941 --> 02:22:50.842]  It's like saying whatever quarterback just won the Super Bowl doesn't know how to be a quarterback.
[02:22:53.837 --> 02:22:57.640]  Trump's an idiot and a political outsider who came from nowhere and won the presidency.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.121]  Well, he's certainly not an idiot.
[02:22:59.141 --> 02:23:00.963]  I gotta go to your calls.
[02:23:01.724 --> 02:23:04.346]  See, I can't say something's coming up and then I start covering it.
[02:23:04.686 --> 02:23:07.288]  But these quotes from this guy, man.
[02:23:07.809 --> 02:23:12.472]  It's like, God Almighty, where do you get people like this?
[02:23:12.793 --> 02:23:13.914]  But obviously it works.
[02:23:15.815 --> 02:23:20.179]  Probably NPR will have a peace sign about the Supreme Court knows nothing about the Constitution.
[02:23:20.499 --> 02:23:21.420]  Well, then who does?
[02:23:24.847 --> 02:23:25.287]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:25.587 --> 02:23:26.047]  I'm sorry.
[02:23:26.347 --> 02:23:26.948]  Oh my gosh.
[02:23:27.028 --> 02:23:28.748]  Mickey in Florida, thanks for holding your trooper.
[02:23:29.168 --> 02:23:30.108]  Go ahead.
[02:23:30.128 --> 02:23:30.429]  Thank you.
[02:23:30.449 --> 02:23:30.809]  Go ahead.
[02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:32.509]  Hey, Alex.
[02:23:32.529 --> 02:23:33.569]  That was awesome.
[02:23:33.869 --> 02:23:38.151]  And I just wanted to say, going on a grouper there, he's an MIT guy, right?
[02:23:39.051 --> 02:23:39.271]  Yeah.
[02:23:40.471 --> 02:23:40.831]  Okay.
[02:23:40.851 --> 02:23:41.672]  Well then, there you go.
[02:23:41.732 --> 02:23:42.872]  That's where his creed comes from.
[02:23:42.912 --> 02:23:44.292]  It comes from everybody just taking it.
[02:23:44.372 --> 02:23:45.633]  Oh, he's got an MIT degree.
[02:23:45.693 --> 02:23:48.193]  He's really, he must know what he's talking about.
[02:23:48.613 --> 02:23:50.454]  That's how he's pulling the wool over everybody's eyes.
[02:23:52.048 --> 02:23:54.531]  Yeah, it may be my earpiece, but I'm getting part of what you're saying.
[02:23:54.671 --> 02:23:55.972]  Just back off your phone a bit and say that again.
[02:23:55.992 --> 02:23:57.694]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:23:57.714 --> 02:23:58.555]  Can you hear me better now?
[02:23:58.695 --> 02:24:05.082]  I'm actually moving from Florida to New Jersey, so I might be in a dead spot of Florida right now.
[02:24:05.543 --> 02:24:06.183]  I can hear you now.
[02:24:06.224 --> 02:24:07.325]  So say what you said again.
[02:24:08.211 --> 02:24:08.791]  Okay, right on.
[02:24:08.851 --> 02:24:18.054]  I was saying about Gruber and him being an MIT guy, I was like, he's able to pull the wool over everybody's eyes because nobody bothers to look anything up or research anything.
[02:24:18.074 --> 02:24:21.055]  They just take his word for his value because he's got that MIT degree.
[02:24:21.795 --> 02:24:22.856]  I mean, that's it, exactly.
[02:24:23.956 --> 02:24:30.258]  He has this incredible institutional arrogance where now the Supreme Court's about to overturn it because they know nothing about the Constitution.
[02:24:30.558 --> 02:24:33.119]  I mean, does he realize how insane that sounds?
[02:24:34.335 --> 02:24:34.655]  Right?
[02:24:35.276 --> 02:24:36.037]  Right, absolutely.
[02:24:36.077 --> 02:24:41.201]  But enough people buy it because they're just like blindsided or blindfolded by the fact that he has that stupid degree.
[02:24:41.221 --> 02:24:43.023]  They're like, oh, he must know.
[02:24:43.043 --> 02:24:44.304]  So they take it at face value.
[02:24:44.324 --> 02:24:47.827]  I mean, I agree.
[02:24:48.007 --> 02:24:48.747]  I mean, I agree.
[02:24:48.787 --> 02:24:50.489]  They never had an argument for Obamacare.
[02:24:50.509 --> 02:24:51.530]  It was so unconstitutional.
[02:24:52.130 --> 02:24:56.094]  And so they just they just ran a confidence game.
[02:24:56.434 --> 02:24:58.636]  And the confidence game has worked for him so long.
[02:24:58.756 --> 02:24:59.597]  Why not just keep it going?
[02:25:00.838 --> 02:25:01.859]  Right, absolutely.
[02:25:02.415 --> 02:25:05.216]  Alex, I gotta tell you, man, you have me so interested in history.
[02:25:05.336 --> 02:25:09.957]  I never cared about history or politics until this past election and finding your show.
[02:25:11.318 --> 02:25:11.898]  So thank you.
[02:25:12.238 --> 02:25:13.158]  Well, listen, thank you.
[02:25:13.198 --> 02:25:14.319]  Thank you for being involved.
[02:25:14.339 --> 02:25:14.939]  Thank you for caring.
[02:25:14.979 --> 02:25:16.479]  But I mean, what's the right analogy?
[02:25:16.539 --> 02:25:17.580]  What's the right comparison?
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:24.302]  This is like saying Roger Staubach knows nothing about being a Dallas Cowboy or
[02:25:26.134 --> 02:25:31.835]  Or saying Terry Bradshaw knows nothing about being a Pittsburgh Steelers.
[02:25:31.915 --> 02:25:39.357]  Or let's use a more modern example of Brady knows nothing about being a New England Patriot.
[02:25:39.417 --> 02:25:42.237]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:25:42.257 --> 02:25:45.698]  It's like the Supreme Court doesn't know anything about the Constitution, okay?
[02:25:46.678 --> 02:25:47.699]  It's just dumbfounding.
[02:25:47.779 --> 02:25:49.419]  It's like, did they really just say that?
[02:25:50.307 --> 02:25:54.128]  And are people actually, like, are they actually comprehending what was just said?
[02:25:54.228 --> 02:25:55.969]  Like, that's the part that blows my mind.
[02:25:56.029 --> 02:25:57.809]  I'm like, did you just hear that?
[02:25:59.470 --> 02:26:14.895]  And so, you know, fortunately, at this point, I don't have too many people left in my life that don't know that, but I still look for them, because I am actually changing jobs right now, but I work with the public a lot, and I, like, encounter about 1,000 people a week in my former job.
[02:26:15.035 --> 02:26:15.935]  So I worked in a casino.
[02:26:16.499 --> 02:26:19.941]  So I was always happy to have conversations with people and educate people.
[02:26:19.961 --> 02:26:23.063]  You know, it's a great chance to send people over to InfoWars.
[02:26:23.603 --> 02:26:28.527]  But I haven't fortunately met too many people down south that are blue.
[02:26:28.667 --> 02:26:32.829]  Now that I'm going back to New Jersey, it's going to be, wow, crazy.
[02:26:32.889 --> 02:26:35.371]  But now I'm going back not an ostrich, thanks to you.
[02:26:36.271 --> 02:26:37.492]  Well, God bless you and we love you.
[02:26:37.512 --> 02:26:38.193]  Keep spreading the word.
[02:26:38.213 --> 02:26:39.013]  You're awesome, Mickey.
[02:26:40.074 --> 02:26:41.875]  Let's go ahead and go to James in Kentucky.
[02:26:41.895 --> 02:26:42.655]  James, you're on the air.
[02:26:42.676 --> 02:26:43.176]  Thanks for holding.
[02:26:43.968 --> 02:26:46.249]  Yeah, I've got two quick points.
[02:26:46.369 --> 02:26:48.390]  One point is, we don't need a border wall.
[02:26:48.930 --> 02:26:50.791]  All we need is landmines in between.
[02:26:50.811 --> 02:26:53.492]  You can't dig underneath them and they can't cross them.
[02:26:54.093 --> 02:26:57.835]  It's a lot more affordable and the Corps of Engineers could have it done in three months.
[02:26:58.375 --> 02:26:59.815]  Hands down on that decision.
[02:27:00.476 --> 02:27:08.840]  Next thing is, Trump needs a call for a martial law so we can have the military invest in the Justice Department, including the FBI.
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:11.361]  Prosecute all involved in the crimes.
[02:27:11.894 --> 02:27:29.982]  Well, you know, Kenya, after the British were kicked out, said, you know, we don't want all these Islamists taking it over from the north of Somalia and Sudan.
[02:27:30.362 --> 02:27:32.123]  So they put landmines in and guess what?
[02:27:32.723 --> 02:27:34.524]  They don't have an illegal immigration problem.
[02:27:35.461 --> 02:27:37.202]  Because they blow your legs off.
[02:27:37.262 --> 02:27:39.824]  The problem is, they'll say, oh, it's inhumane.
[02:27:40.204 --> 02:27:44.627]  The left will march some 10-year-old kid across and blow their legs off, or a bouncing Betty or whatever.
[02:27:44.647 --> 02:27:45.087]  But you're right.
[02:27:45.828 --> 02:27:49.770]  All over the world, landmines are used to say, hey, here's a sign.
[02:27:49.930 --> 02:27:52.312]  Landmines, don't come across the next 100 yards.
[02:27:52.652 --> 02:27:53.192]  And guess what?
[02:27:53.373 --> 02:27:54.873]  They work really well, don't they?
[02:27:55.674 --> 02:28:01.438]  So yes, it's better than tens of thousands dying trying to go across a desert, isn't it?
[02:28:02.238 --> 02:28:04.219]  They're not going to cross it if they know it's there.
[02:28:04.279 --> 02:28:04.980]  That's the big thing.
[02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:10.192]  Well, the point of a landmine field is to tell people you're entering landmines.
[02:28:10.493 --> 02:28:11.373]  Danger landmines.
[02:28:12.114 --> 02:28:17.157]  But notice the UN wants landmines banned because they don't want borders because they're conquering nation states.
[02:28:17.177 --> 02:28:17.597]  But you're right.
[02:28:18.017 --> 02:28:30.125]  The cheapest way to protect a border is to put landmines up, and then all you do is look at aerial photographs where one explodes here and there, or where the buzzards show up, and you go put the landmines back in.
[02:28:30.145 --> 02:28:30.946]  And that's what you do.
[02:28:31.046 --> 02:28:35.128]  And then you don't have hundreds of thousands, millions of people trying to cross your border.
[02:28:35.148 --> 02:28:35.749]  Anything else, James?
[02:28:36.434 --> 02:28:37.255]  Nope, that'll be it.
[02:28:37.275 --> 02:28:40.017]  I sure appreciate all you do for everybody.
[02:28:40.598 --> 02:28:41.478]  Thank you.
[02:28:41.558 --> 02:28:44.000]  Headline, Alex Jones endorses landmines.
[02:28:44.601 --> 02:28:45.982]  No, I didn't endorse landmines.
[02:28:46.503 --> 02:28:47.363]  But the caller's right.
[02:28:48.024 --> 02:28:50.306]  The cheapest way to protect your border is with landmines.
[02:28:51.127 --> 02:28:53.368]  And that's what everybody did like 20 years ago when the U.N.
[02:28:53.388 --> 02:28:54.249]  got landmines banned.
[02:28:54.289 --> 02:28:56.591]  You don't just put landmines out randomly.
[02:28:56.811 --> 02:28:59.534]  You put them on the border and have signs saying, Danger!
[02:28:59.614 --> 02:29:00.114]  Landmines!
[02:29:00.154 --> 02:29:00.775]  With a skull!
[02:29:02.844 --> 02:29:03.664]  Look, we all do it.
[02:29:04.265 --> 02:29:05.605]  A lot of times we don't have a choice.
[02:29:05.625 --> 02:29:13.427]  You go on a trip, you book into a big globalist hotel that funds groups trying to take our guns and teach our five-year-old boys how to wear dresses.
[02:29:13.867 --> 02:29:14.348]  It's a fact.
[02:29:14.368 --> 02:29:18.449]  These corporations are out to conquer humanity, not to break up our families.
[02:29:19.169 --> 02:29:22.710]  And sometimes I can't find an item at another online shop, I go to Amazon.
[02:29:23.350 --> 02:29:25.411]  But I consciously try to not do it.
[02:29:26.607 --> 02:29:35.475]  In fact, when I use a product, or I hear about folks that like a product, I tend to get the product and then sell it at a huge discount at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:29:36.276 --> 02:29:44.304]  There aren't many places where you can go where you're going to find items lower than Amazon, because they have created a total monopoly.
[02:29:44.584 --> 02:29:47.667]  They get like $1.48 on every shipment from the federal government.
[02:29:47.987 --> 02:29:48.648]  We don't do that.
[02:29:50.011 --> 02:29:54.093]  But we still bring you deals so good that in many cases it's better than Amazon.
[02:29:54.213 --> 02:30:01.236]  So you're funding the second American Revolution, you're sticking it in the eye of the globalists, and you're getting great products all at the same time.
[02:30:01.636 --> 02:30:03.737]  It's called a 360 win.
[02:30:03.757 --> 02:30:13.180]  I talk about that a lot, but you're not getting a 360 win when you go to Target or Walmart and buy a toy that breaks when you get it out of the box.
[02:30:13.981 --> 02:30:14.801]  And I'm not judging you.
[02:30:15.281 --> 02:30:16.722]  I was at the mall a week ago,
[02:30:19.117 --> 02:30:22.200]  19-month-old daughter saw this little robot car.
[02:30:23.161 --> 02:30:23.801]  She wanted it.
[02:30:24.442 --> 02:30:25.503]  I bought it from the woman.
[02:30:26.283 --> 02:30:29.105]  It was broken when I got home and didn't work.
[02:30:30.907 --> 02:30:33.049]  Well, we're not selling products like that.
[02:30:33.089 --> 02:30:41.175]  Whether it's the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, the books, the videos, the patron apparel, it's all the very best at the lowest prices.
[02:30:41.235 --> 02:30:44.478]  So, we have the 12 Days of Christmas, the biggest sale in our history.
[02:30:45.387 --> 02:30:47.069]  We're selling on inventory ahead of the end of the year.
[02:30:47.909 --> 02:30:53.515]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% is the lowest discount, up to 75%.
[02:30:53.575 --> 02:30:55.337]  We're losing money on a lot of these.
[02:30:55.757 --> 02:30:56.958]  So we have the 12 days of Christmas.
[02:30:57.259 --> 02:31:00.081]  One item every day was particularly discounted up to 75%.
[02:31:00.181 --> 02:31:08.830]  We're bringing all of those sales back up until the 19th, when you're still guaranteed to get delivered to the continental United States before Christmas.
[02:31:10.487 --> 02:31:15.767]  Biggest sale in our history, extended, and now all the super sales!
[02:31:16.584 --> 02:31:17.424]  That we're already there.
[02:31:17.444 --> 02:31:21.506]  The very best sales the last 12 days are all brought back right now.
[02:31:21.826 --> 02:31:25.927]  While not fighting traffic and not fighting all the stupid crowds at the big box stores.
[02:31:26.207 --> 02:31:29.448]  And not giving your money to Jeff Bezos that literally wants to gang rape this country.
[02:31:30.028 --> 02:31:34.890]  These specials were such massive lost leaders that we can only promote them for 24 hours.
[02:31:35.210 --> 02:31:40.571]  But now we're bringing back all of our InfoWars Christmas Mega Specials and InfoWarsTore.com for a limited time.
[02:31:40.871 --> 02:31:43.372]  And many are already completely selling out.
[02:31:43.992 --> 02:31:45.213]  So everything we had
[02:31:46.093 --> 02:31:50.015]  It's back on sale at the lowest price, except for items that have already sold out.
[02:31:50.236 --> 02:31:55.859]  Most products are still there, but a lot are going to be selling out, including best-selling t-shirts, so take advantage of this right now.
[02:31:56.619 --> 02:32:05.905]  I have made the decision to completely sell out our entire 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.
[02:32:06.225 --> 02:32:12.029]  This is our last chance, and your last chance, to take advantage of these Christmas super specials, including Brain Force Plus,
[02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:16.991]  55% off and free shipping and a free t-shirt and double Patriot points.

[02:32:21.674 --> 02:32:22.814]  I mean, there's too much to mention.
[02:32:23.655 --> 02:32:29.698]  The Bodies for 60% off and you get the free t-shirt and free shipping and double Patriot points.
[02:32:29.978 --> 02:32:35.021]  The Last Run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality, 55% off, free t-shirt, free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:32:35.501 --> 02:32:37.042]  Ultimate Bone Broth, same deal.

[02:32:52.831 --> 02:32:54.132]  Alpha Power, it goes on and on.
[02:32:54.432 --> 02:32:55.193]  Biggest sale ever.
[02:32:55.253 --> 02:32:56.033]  Be part of history.
[02:32:56.254 --> 02:32:57.154]  Get great products.
[02:32:57.294 --> 02:32:58.195]  Win-win for everybody.
[02:32:58.495 --> 02:32:59.936]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:09.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.648 --> 02:33:28.771]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:33:29.552 --> 02:33:31.013]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:32.914 --> 02:33:36.577]  So, if you wanted to ask who knows about the U.S.
[02:33:36.617 --> 02:33:44.063]  Constitution more than anybody, you'd say, if you were on Jeopardy with Alex Trebek, you would say the Supreme Court.
[02:33:45.084 --> 02:33:47.386]  Doesn't mean they can't be judicial tyrants sometimes.
[02:33:47.426 --> 02:33:49.847]  Doesn't mean they can't make law from the bench.
[02:33:50.508 --> 02:33:54.351]  Doesn't mean, especially with leftists, that sometimes they ignore clearly what's clear-cut.
[02:33:57.125 --> 02:34:00.748]  But Jonathan Gruber, who says, thank God you're so stupid.
[02:34:00.768 --> 02:34:01.849]  Thank God you don't have a memory.
[02:34:02.389 --> 02:34:04.030]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[02:34:05.311 --> 02:34:06.152]  Jamie White article.
[02:34:08.694 --> 02:34:15.139]  Obama care architect claims Supreme Court of the United States doesn't understand Constitution ahead of the ruling.
[02:34:17.701 --> 02:34:19.623]  This is the guy that said, thank God you're so stupid.
[02:34:20.463 --> 02:34:21.524]  And thank God you don't have a memory.
[02:34:21.785 --> 02:34:23.226]  I know I just said that 10 seconds ago, but.
[02:34:24.090 --> 02:34:26.032]  This is a guy that said, thank God you're so stupid.
[02:34:26.673 --> 02:34:27.694]  Thank God you don't have a memory.
[02:34:29.936 --> 02:34:31.758]  There's no end to these people.
[02:34:32.899 --> 02:34:33.800]  I'm gonna go back to your calls.
[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:34.921]  It's just incredible.
[02:34:35.301 --> 02:34:36.603]  These are real quotes he made.
[02:34:39.706 --> 02:34:41.768]  No, he says he understands it.
[02:34:43.652 --> 02:34:45.733]  And Democrats on the Senate, they know better.
[02:34:46.414 --> 02:34:58.480]  I mean, if you're going to ask who knows best, who is on record that knows the most about federal law, and who is the ultimate arbiter, who has the power over it?
[02:34:59.461 --> 02:35:00.261]  That's undebatable.
[02:35:00.481 --> 02:35:01.182]  It's the Supreme Court.
[02:35:02.703 --> 02:35:04.604]  Who holds the reins, Gruber?
[02:35:04.764 --> 02:35:08.406]  It isn't you, you arrogant academic fop.
[02:35:12.850 --> 02:35:15.592]  I mean, the left said the Supreme Court was God.
[02:35:16.073 --> 02:35:21.917]  Capital G, capital O, capital D. Or just not even, just dash, dash, dash, can't even say God.
[02:35:23.058 --> 02:35:24.039]  It was Jehovah.
[02:35:27.442 --> 02:35:28.222]  It was Yahweh.
[02:35:28.383 --> 02:35:34.127]  I mean, to them, I'm not saying it is, to them it was big capital God.
[02:35:36.069 --> 02:35:37.590]  Up there on the mountain, Mount Olympus.
[02:35:38.271 --> 02:35:39.151]  Up there on the burning bush.
[02:35:40.993 --> 02:35:42.314]  Hiding right over there behind that Christmas tree.
[02:35:43.994 --> 02:35:46.536]  And now he says they don't owe jack crap.
[02:35:46.976 --> 02:36:02.247]  Man, the bravada, the aplomb, the chutzpah, the hubris, the arrogance, the just, these people make me sick.
[02:36:05.970 --> 02:36:12.835]  You can't mandate someone, because this says even if you don't have money, buy something that's private.
[02:36:15.219 --> 02:36:23.144]  That's why members of the court earlier blackmailed, reportedly said, well, the only power there is to do that is taxation, so we'll call it a tax.
[02:36:23.504 --> 02:36:27.146]  The only way we can say this is constitutional is to say it's a tax.
[02:36:27.166 --> 02:36:34.331]  But you can't say a private group can then levy a tax with governmental power and lobby for it!
[02:36:35.251 --> 02:36:37.393]  That's the lobbyist's ultimate dream!
[02:36:43.186 --> 02:36:44.467]  Obviously that's unconstitutional.
[02:36:44.948 --> 02:36:49.852]  And finally, courts start ruling the way anybody would.
[02:36:49.872 --> 02:36:50.833]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[02:36:51.373 --> 02:36:52.714]  And Gruber swaggers in.
[02:36:52.755 --> 02:36:53.195]  Here it is.
[02:36:53.896 --> 02:37:04.385]  Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber emerged to defend his health care bill ahead of a Supreme Court ruling after it had ruled unconstitutional by a Texas federal judge last week.
[02:37:04.865 --> 02:37:06.006]  In a CNN appearance.
[02:37:06.126 --> 02:37:06.467]  Perfect.
[02:37:06.807 --> 02:37:07.908]  Total liar on CNN.
[02:37:09.489 --> 02:37:10.210]  That's where he belongs.
[02:37:10.770 --> 02:37:22.238]  In a CNN interview today, Gruber, who infamously said in 2013 that Obamacare passage depended on the stupidity of the American voter, claimed the U.S.
[02:37:22.278 --> 02:37:26.600]  Supreme Court didn't understand the Constitution as well as Senate constitutional experts.
[02:37:26.661 --> 02:37:27.061]  You know what?
[02:37:27.661 --> 02:37:29.102]  I want to call this the Gruber test.
[02:37:29.122 --> 02:37:32.104]  You know, they call dumb people doing dumb things.
[02:37:33.985 --> 02:37:34.706]  Darwin Awards.
[02:37:38.101 --> 02:37:41.384]  So, this is kind of what I want to call the Gruber Awards.
[02:37:42.785 --> 02:37:58.218]  If you were a full-grown adult in a five-year-old's body, and there's some meth head with a puppy and candy in some creeper van going, I got candy, I got candy, and you see a kid chained up laying in the back by him, a child might get tricked, but an adult wouldn't.
[02:37:58.758 --> 02:38:02.161]  But, I mean, Gruber calls you an idiot, says you're a moron.
[02:38:02.441 --> 02:38:06.685]  He's cruising up and down the street in a creeper van trying to rape the country and your future.
[02:38:08.362 --> 02:38:09.862]  He goes on, I mean we even got the video clip.
[02:38:09.882 --> 02:38:10.923]  I'm gonna go to your call zone.
[02:38:12.063 --> 02:38:13.524]  He goes out and he does all this.
[02:38:13.564 --> 02:38:14.544]  He thinks you're an idiot.
[02:38:17.765 --> 02:38:18.585]  Will you put up with that?
[02:38:20.106 --> 02:38:21.166]  This guy is unbelievable.
[02:38:24.307 --> 02:38:24.847]  Here's a quote.
[02:38:25.768 --> 02:38:30.029]  The Supreme Court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise.
[02:38:31.161 --> 02:38:41.528]  Of the broad Senate constitutional experts who, for example, in 2012 by an 80 to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional.
[02:38:41.568 --> 02:38:42.369]  You mean you bought them off?
[02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:47.953]  Yet the Supreme Court found it wasn't already before.
[02:38:49.114 --> 02:38:52.596]  Yeah, they just found that they have a power to tax, but not a mandate to do that.
[02:38:59.491 --> 02:39:00.452]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:39:00.472 --> 02:39:01.692]  These other headlines are insane.
[02:39:02.273 --> 02:39:07.216]  Freebeacon.com, FCC weighing model legislation for state internet tax.
[02:39:07.796 --> 02:39:09.897]  The Democrats want to tax text messages.
[02:39:10.218 --> 02:39:11.758]  The thing that the poorest people use.
[02:39:12.319 --> 02:39:13.900]  They want to tax your communications.
[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:15.140]  That means track them.
[02:39:15.481 --> 02:39:16.041]  God help us.
[02:39:19.083 --> 02:39:24.126]  Yes, healthcare stocks plunged after Obamacare because the healthcare companies wrote it to rape the hell out of you.
[02:39:29.036 --> 02:39:30.377]  Alright, we're going to get your phone calls right now.
[02:39:30.417 --> 02:39:31.138]  Who's up next, guys?
[02:39:31.178 --> 02:39:31.958]  Who's been holding longest?
[02:39:36.121 --> 02:39:38.123]  Alright, Chris in Washington, then Carlos.
[02:39:38.183 --> 02:39:40.024]  Chris, you're on the air from Washington State.
[02:39:40.044 --> 02:39:40.424]  Go ahead.
[02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:42.846]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:39:43.967 --> 02:39:46.189]  A lot of good stuff happening, a lot of bad stuff happening.
[02:39:46.209 --> 02:39:46.869]  My head's spinning.
[02:39:46.889 --> 02:39:47.409]  What about you?
[02:39:47.970 --> 02:39:49.571]  Oh, me and you both, brother.
[02:39:50.051 --> 02:39:51.733]  I just want to get your opinion on
[02:39:52.731 --> 02:39:55.872]  Hell, Obamacare is unconstitutional now.
[02:39:55.912 --> 02:39:59.874]  What do you think the IRS is going to do with all that money that they took from the people?
[02:40:01.074 --> 02:40:01.995]  Oh, that's a good point.
[02:40:02.135 --> 02:40:06.837]  I don't think we'll all be getting refunds for the last five, six years of swindled money.
[02:40:07.857 --> 02:40:08.778]  Oh yeah, me neither.
[02:40:09.138 --> 02:40:13.379]  I think it's going to go to our roads like they said it's going to, at least.
[02:40:16.368 --> 02:40:17.409]  Anything like that?
[02:40:17.929 --> 02:40:19.530]  Or do you think it's all just BS?
[02:40:19.890 --> 02:40:20.690]  Oh, it's all BS.
[02:40:20.730 --> 02:40:22.911]  It was all a big giant scam for insurance companies.
[02:40:23.832 --> 02:40:28.614]  And Trump just came out and tweeted, he says, as I predicted... Can we put that back up real quick?
[02:40:28.634 --> 02:40:30.435]  Thanks for putting it up.
[02:40:30.615 --> 02:40:35.917]  As he predicted, as I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional zester.
[02:40:36.417 --> 02:40:41.280]  Now Congress must pass a strong law that provides great health care and protects pre-existing conditions.
[02:40:42.188 --> 02:40:43.389]  Mitch and Nancy, get it done.
[02:40:43.469 --> 02:40:48.793]  And look, if you open it up for competition, which the big insurance companies don't want, it'll drive down prices.
[02:40:48.853 --> 02:40:49.553]  Just do it!
[02:40:49.573 --> 02:40:54.156]  And that's what Trump did trying to release all these treatments they've got that they've blocked for 20 years.
[02:40:55.677 --> 02:40:56.918]  That's so true, Alex.
[02:40:57.458 --> 02:40:58.779]  Thank you for all you do.
[02:40:58.799 --> 02:41:07.265]  I was watching your documentaries this weekend, and it's thanks to you I was watching the Obama one and I was able to wake someone up.
[02:41:07.885 --> 02:41:08.326]  Thank you.
[02:41:09.189 --> 02:41:09.990]  Well, sir, thank you.
[02:41:10.010 --> 02:41:11.953]  That's one thing we're going to get back into, is the documentaries.
[02:41:12.153 --> 02:41:19.342]  It's not that I'm lazy, I'm just busy all the time, but in 2019, I want to put out at least three documentaries, free to air for everybody.
[02:41:19.823 --> 02:41:20.824]  We'll get them out to everybody.
[02:41:20.844 --> 02:41:24.488]  It does cost money to make them, but no, with your purchases at M4Shore.com,
[02:41:25.839 --> 02:41:51.710]  of supplements and t-shirts and books and films and water filtration air filtration with all the purchases you make it goes back to fund this operation our crew building this operation up launching more live shows but also making documentaries we're gonna go big we're gonna go heavy into that so that's my commitment to you ladies and gentlemen it's all coming up I just can't be a perfectionist the best documentaries I ever made I was in a hurry I had all the material I just did it
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:52.901]  I don't
[02:42:11.383 --> 02:42:12.325]  Get up off my ass.
[02:42:12.385 --> 02:42:19.696]  I mean, I wouldn't say I was being lazy before, but now I'm more focused, and I'm going to give you my full effort, because you've come through, Friend4s.
[02:42:20.177 --> 02:42:22.320]  The listeners, the viewers, the supporters.
[02:42:23.621 --> 02:42:27.523]  In our darkest hours, so far, have really come through for InfoWars.
[02:42:28.324 --> 02:42:36.549]  And because you've come through for us, despite all my warts, all my problems, you've got my commitment that I'm not going to back down one bit.
[02:42:37.209 --> 02:42:39.411]  Not one scintilla, not one micron.
[02:42:40.251 --> 02:42:46.895]  And it's going to be an imperfect attack, but you're going to get my full energy when I slam into their Iron Fortress.
[02:42:49.457 --> 02:42:51.238]  See, we're made of something hard as well.
[02:42:51.658 --> 02:42:52.319]  It's called love.
[02:42:53.687 --> 02:42:55.228]  I believe we're going to pierce the enemy's heart.
[02:42:55.908 --> 02:43:00.909]  I believe InfoWars in the next 12 months, may take a while to show itself, will deliver the death blow.
[02:43:05.511 --> 02:43:10.192]  There are a lot of different schools of thought in marketing, and in advertising, and in sales.
[02:43:11.229 --> 02:43:15.030]  Now, I've been on the radio and TV for 23 plus years.
[02:43:15.050 --> 02:43:17.511]  I never went to any professional schools.
[02:43:18.372 --> 02:43:23.534]  But over the years, I learned a lot about those professional schools and the different perspectives.
[02:43:24.694 --> 02:43:27.515]  There's five or six different ways that people pitch things.
[02:43:27.615 --> 02:43:30.336]  And there's different permutations and commutations of that.
[02:43:31.877 --> 02:43:34.578]  But I just come from it with the golden rule.
[02:43:34.658 --> 02:43:36.038]  Treat others like you want to be treated.
[02:43:36.679 --> 02:43:39.960]  Do unto others as you would like to be done unto you.
[02:43:41.357 --> 02:43:48.619]  And we've taken that philosophy to the next level with all the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:52.521]  Now, let's just look at two different systems of sales.
[02:43:52.541 --> 02:44:03.384]  The one that we fall into and then the one that targets about 25% of the population that is currently still the most successful and the most lucrative system.
[02:44:05.125 --> 02:44:06.205]  The corrupt form
[02:44:07.602 --> 02:44:12.686]  I wouldn't say it's completely evil, because it's targeting folks that just always want to pay more.
[02:44:13.627 --> 02:44:21.492]  It's a system where you put everything into it being elite and being top end and the most expensive.
[02:44:22.353 --> 02:44:27.657]  And in almost every case, what's in it does not measure up even close to what it's costing.
[02:44:28.738 --> 02:44:30.159]  Now, I've got a little bit of money.
[02:44:30.874 --> 02:44:34.417]  And so if I wanted to buy something fancy just because it's fancy, I could do it.
[02:44:35.278 --> 02:44:47.408]  But there's a lot of things that if it's a rip-off, even though I want it and I need it, I'm gonna go find the alternative that's as good, a lot of times better, for less just because I'm not into wasting for no reason.
[02:44:47.428 --> 02:44:49.950]  I'd rather give it to charity or something like that.
[02:44:50.831 --> 02:44:54.794]  But that's the two different schools of thought I wanted to get into is the one where
[02:44:55.945 --> 02:45:05.361]  They know that if something's supposedly the best, you say it's the best, even though it's not, and you charge an outrageous amount, people believe it must be the best because it's an outrageous amount.
[02:45:05.882 --> 02:45:07.064]  Now, here's what I do.
[02:45:08.206 --> 02:45:13.448]  I go out of my own life and I find what is the best for the very lowest price.
[02:45:13.768 --> 02:45:14.328]  And here's an example.
[02:45:14.588 --> 02:45:17.389]  I have a Dodge Hellcat that came out four years ago.
[02:45:17.649 --> 02:45:20.390]  I didn't want a really fast sports car because I didn't want to be flashy.
[02:45:20.590 --> 02:45:22.551]  I was at the Dodge dealership with my truck.
[02:45:22.691 --> 02:45:23.271]  The guy was illiterate.
[02:45:23.291 --> 02:45:24.192]  He said, have you heard of Hellcats?
[02:45:24.212 --> 02:45:25.092]  They've been coming out about a year.
[02:45:25.312 --> 02:45:26.913]  And I said, uh, no.
[02:45:27.113 --> 02:45:30.454]  And he said, well, it's a Dodge Challenger, 700 plus horsepower.
[02:45:30.594 --> 02:45:30.894]  It's only $63,000.
[02:45:31.694 --> 02:45:33.715]  And Ferrari owns us now.
[02:45:34.055 --> 02:45:36.356]  And to have a car like this would cost like half a million dollars.
[02:45:36.796 --> 02:45:40.138]  And it didn't stick out, but I like a really fast, cool car.
[02:45:40.338 --> 02:45:41.319]  So I have the best of both worlds.
[02:45:41.339 --> 02:45:44.380]  Looks like a Challenger, but I've driven one of my friend's Ferraris.
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:45.401]  It's as fast.
[02:45:45.581 --> 02:45:46.081]  It's insane.
[02:45:46.401 --> 02:45:47.562]  That's my mindset.
[02:45:48.102 --> 02:45:53.145]  I want a badass black Ferrari for $63,000 instead of a half million or a million.
[02:45:53.445 --> 02:45:54.686]  We can go up to $2 million for a Ferrari.
[02:45:55.521 --> 02:45:56.482]  I don't want the bling.
[02:45:56.702 --> 02:45:57.402]  I want the zing.
[02:45:57.663 --> 02:46:03.067]  We sold out, for their year of in-sale, of the Alexa Pure Pro Gravity-Fed Filter.
[02:46:03.147 --> 02:46:03.787]  We sold it all out.
[02:46:04.127 --> 02:46:05.188]  They didn't think we could do it.
[02:46:05.388 --> 02:46:05.869]  You bought it.
[02:46:05.909 --> 02:46:06.629]  It's a great system.
[02:46:06.849 --> 02:46:08.290]  You got it for basically 49% off, half off.
[02:46:08.310 --> 02:46:09.351]  They've never done that.
[02:46:09.611 --> 02:46:15.055]  Now, they're going to do the Alexa Pure Breeze, that is, an ion filter, normally $250.
[02:46:15.676 --> 02:46:17.277]  Leading competitors are as good, they're $800.
[02:46:17.317 --> 02:46:18.478]  It's the same deal.
[02:46:18.958 --> 02:46:22.281]  Similar systems, four-stage ions, that aren't even as good, $400, $600, $800 depending on the unit.
[02:46:24.182 --> 02:46:24.703]  This is normally $2.40, $2.50.
[02:46:25.423 --> 02:46:26.764]  It's $1.27.
[02:46:26.804 --> 02:46:29.546]  Again, they're selling them to us at cost.
[02:46:29.926 --> 02:46:33.509]  We make like $30, and it clears out their end-of-year inventory.
[02:46:33.949 --> 02:46:35.991]  And it's so good for your house, so good for your family.
[02:46:36.211 --> 02:46:36.771]  It's amazing.
[02:46:36.831 --> 02:46:39.713]  Alexa Pure Breeze at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:46:40.234 --> 02:46:48.260]  It is the Hellcat of air filtration compared to the Ferraris that aren't even as good but have a so-called bling and cost five times more.
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:51.621]  Get yours today at InfoWarsTore.com, Alexa for your breeze.
[02:46:51.641 --> 02:46:54.562]  There's only a couple thousand of these and they're going to sell out.
[02:46:54.982 --> 02:46:55.542]  You can't lose.
[02:46:55.602 --> 02:46:58.263]  It supports the InfoWar and your own health for you and your children.
[02:46:58.303 --> 02:46:59.344]  Get it today.
[02:47:06.326 --> 02:47:08.947]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:33.703 --> 02:47:41.326]  We're going to Carlos right now, then a whole bunch of other callers like Dr. Telly, Grant, many others, Cameron, Noah, we're going to you right now.
[02:47:42.066 --> 02:47:43.986]  Carlos in Canada, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:47:45.087 --> 02:47:46.267]  Hello, hi Alex.
[02:47:47.067 --> 02:47:47.588]  Thanks for calling.
[02:47:47.608 --> 02:47:48.328]  Just two points.
[02:47:48.568 --> 02:47:50.249]  The second point is about the wall.
[02:47:50.649 --> 02:47:57.311]  My first point is about Jesus of Nazareth throwing, overturning the tables of the
[02:47:57.873 --> 02:48:02.595]  Money lenders and bankers that made themselves at home in the temple.
[02:48:03.015 --> 02:48:12.319]  They have elevated themselves in society to a level which was, as he understood it, destructive to the very society that they were supposed to service.
[02:48:12.739 --> 02:48:15.200]  Now they were elevating themselves to the level of the deity.
[02:48:15.721 --> 02:48:23.344]  And the point I'm making is that America was founded in large measure on a motivation of capitalism.
[02:48:23.985 --> 02:48:29.087]  And for lack of a better word, I call it bankerism that is bringing down America.
[02:48:29.528 --> 02:48:36.491]  You see, capitalism is an individual working hard to generate, through his effort and labor, capital.
[02:48:36.691 --> 02:48:39.352]  Capital he can exchange for goods and for services.
[02:48:39.872 --> 02:48:48.416]  But when you take bankerism, what you do is that you take that working ability away and you print the capital out of thin air.
[02:48:48.756 --> 02:48:49.797]  We discussed this before.
[02:48:50.450 --> 02:48:57.883]  But when you take the capital out of thin air, now you take in individuals that are no longer living a reality based on labor.
[02:48:58.490 --> 02:49:02.293]  And so the currency which emits from that is worthless.
[02:49:02.533 --> 02:49:03.754]  It's literally worthless.
[02:49:03.994 --> 02:49:05.355]  And the world is beginning to realize that.
[02:49:05.395 --> 02:49:06.997]  Well, that's what the money changers were doing.
[02:49:07.037 --> 02:49:09.879]  They made you buy a special coin, inflate its price ten times.
[02:49:10.359 --> 02:49:12.040]  That's fractional reserve banking.
[02:49:12.421 --> 02:49:20.167]  And they put themselves between the people and God as the priesthood and made you pay money to get into the temple.
[02:49:20.187 --> 02:49:21.327]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:49:21.368 --> 02:49:24.150]  And so Christ reserved violence for only one group.
[02:49:24.890 --> 02:49:29.394]  And you're right, we're dealing with bankerism, where they give themselves free money but then charge us.
[02:49:30.395 --> 02:49:39.744]  Yeah, it's parasitism, but because it's done in the financial industry by people that lend money, it has to be called bankerism, as opposed to a biological thing.
[02:49:40.304 --> 02:49:48.472]  And the second point I want to make to you, I mean, Jesus of Nazareth dealt with it in his time and gave a lesson to the world.
[02:49:49.155 --> 02:49:50.337]  Yes, we have missed that lesson.
[02:49:50.677 --> 02:50:02.755]  I hope that President Trump is listening so that he can understand that he, as President, has the ability to direct this missive and restore capitalism through the Treasury of the United States.
[02:50:03.166 --> 02:50:06.828]  It's the only thing that will save the value of money.
[02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:15.734]  It's the only thing that will save the dollar and will save the economy from collapsing, as has been mentioned, to the level of the 29 crash.
[02:50:16.354 --> 02:50:25.120]  This is very serious because the cities now and the people are not prepared to live 30 days, 90 days without having food in their fridge.
[02:50:25.420 --> 02:50:27.221]  I mean, this is a reality.
[02:50:27.441 --> 02:50:28.382]  You're right, Carlos.
[02:50:28.702 --> 02:50:29.262]  Great points.
[02:50:29.382 --> 02:50:29.903]  God bless you.
[02:50:29.923 --> 02:50:31.143]  We're sitting on top of Time Bomb.
[02:50:31.544 --> 02:50:31.944]  I'm glad.
[02:50:31.984 --> 02:50:33.005]  I'm really glad he called.
[02:50:33.605 --> 02:50:35.086]  Okay, he's been holding along us now.
[02:50:35.106 --> 02:50:41.630]  Let's talk to Shabazz in Wisconsin.
[02:50:42.090 --> 02:50:43.171]  Shabazz, you're on the air.
[02:50:43.211 --> 02:50:45.072]  Go ahead.
[02:50:45.752 --> 02:50:46.773]  Are you here, Alex?
[02:50:46.953 --> 02:50:47.173]  I am.
[02:50:47.213 --> 02:50:47.534]  Go ahead.
[02:50:48.474 --> 02:50:48.734]  All right.
[02:50:49.295 --> 02:50:50.395]  Glad to speak to you, sir.
[02:50:50.776 --> 02:50:52.617]  First time caller, long time listener.
[02:50:52.777 --> 02:50:53.077]  Welcome.
[02:50:54.187 --> 02:50:56.529]  Alright, I'm going to make it brief.
[02:50:56.969 --> 02:50:57.430]  I'm sorry.
[02:50:59.571 --> 02:51:08.758]  Forgive me for giving you a little bit of backdrop, but I play violent video games.
[02:51:08.819 --> 02:51:09.519]  I grew up on them.
[02:51:10.300 --> 02:51:17.405]  I've been playing violent video games and I played one that was called Metal Gear Solid.
[02:51:18.166 --> 02:51:23.310]  Expose me to terms that you use nowadays, such as nanomachines.
[02:51:24.344 --> 02:51:27.967]  And, uh, nanotechnology and everything like that.
[02:51:28.627 --> 02:51:30.828]  And, uh, the DARPA, DARPA chief.
[02:51:32.069 --> 02:51:34.391]  And stuff, and, uh, stuff like that.
[02:51:35.151 --> 02:51:35.592]  I'm sorry.
[02:51:35.672 --> 02:51:37.193]  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a little, uh.
[02:51:37.373 --> 02:51:38.253]  No, no, it's fine.
[02:51:38.474 --> 02:51:42.716]  And yeah, I mean, a lot of those video games have composites of things that really happen in the real world.
[02:51:43.697 --> 02:51:44.558]  Yeah.
[02:51:44.678 --> 02:51:49.381]  And it really, really spoke to me when I was only 12 years old.
[02:51:50.141 --> 02:51:53.604]  I was over, over 18 years ago, you know, and
[02:51:55.075 --> 02:52:00.639]  Um, when I heard you speak about those kind of things, I found out that it was real.
[02:52:02.140 --> 02:52:06.442]  I was like, I was dumb, dumb shot, dumb, dumb spoken, you know?
[02:52:06.502 --> 02:52:08.163]  No, I mean, it's true.
[02:52:08.203 --> 02:52:14.547]  I mean, InfoWars, when we cover, but also David and I, people like Dr. Nick Baggage, are like the precursor for a lot of the video games.
[02:52:14.948 --> 02:52:16.048]  I appreciate your call, Shabazz.
[02:52:16.068 --> 02:52:16.629]  Good to hear from you.
[02:52:16.649 --> 02:52:17.749]  Let's take more calls.
[02:52:17.769 --> 02:52:18.550]  We're moving quick now.
[02:52:18.570 --> 02:52:20.771]  Let's talk to Stan in Indiana.
[02:52:20.791 --> 02:52:21.652]  Stan, you're on the air.
[02:52:21.672 --> 02:52:22.733]  Then we'll go to Grant and others.
[02:52:22.773 --> 02:52:23.093]  Go ahead.
[02:52:24.667 --> 02:52:24.987]  Hello.
[02:52:25.007 --> 02:52:27.789]  Hey, you know that hand, Collins Gruber?
[02:52:27.849 --> 02:52:28.990]  He's a real piece of work.
[02:52:29.350 --> 02:52:43.060]  I kind of think that he is probably one of the biggest reasons why we have so much contempt, him and all these other people, for the man's point of view, if you will.
[02:52:43.920 --> 02:52:45.241]  But that ain't what I called in about.
[02:52:45.301 --> 02:52:53.627]  I wanted to call in about a reference I'm sure you're familiar with, the hearing of Kavanaugh, Christine Blasey Ford.
[02:52:55.218 --> 02:53:10.531]  Uh, this event, the history that's took place from that, it seems as though that whole event was a stepping stone for the abortion pill to be handed out on the college campuses and universities out there in California.
[02:53:10.612 --> 02:53:14.355]  You know, it's kind of a stepping ground for the whole nation in a lot of cases.
[02:53:15.536 --> 02:53:20.260]  Uh, so it seems as though what we're doing is we're allowing
[02:53:22.185 --> 02:53:28.787]  What's left of the heterosexual females to become abortion factories for their career.
[02:53:29.687 --> 02:53:34.169]  And, you know, I see this as an element of mind camp, if you will.
[02:53:34.649 --> 02:53:35.729]  You know, it's an enforcement.
[02:53:36.329 --> 02:53:42.371]  It seems like our colleges and universities are always having to be under the influence of a foreign entity.
[02:53:43.431 --> 02:53:48.433]  Oh, there's no doubt that Milazi Ford is a spook, a globalist, and an anti-woman.
[02:53:49.605 --> 02:53:51.646]  Yeah, that's the way I feel about it, too.
[02:53:51.686 --> 02:53:54.828]  I mean, it was, it was, uh, and to think that the former attorney of President Trump
[02:54:17.890 --> 02:54:21.152]  is going through so much strife with these things.
[02:54:21.772 --> 02:54:25.794]  And she was given immunity to basically get there and lie.
[02:54:26.314 --> 02:54:36.899]  There were so many lies that was exposed about her, her involvement with the lie detector test, the training of the FBI agents.
[02:54:38.580 --> 02:54:41.481]  This woman was just pretending
[02:54:42.307 --> 02:54:52.253]  She's a college professor and she's pretending before America and before... Well notice she looks just like Shrock.
[02:54:52.994 --> 02:54:56.056]  She does those little sick piggy looks at Democrats.
[02:54:56.536 --> 02:55:00.899]  Where it's like, oh we're all part of this little trick and I've been trained to be a good little doggie.
[02:55:01.439 --> 02:55:03.721]  I mean this woman's brain is completely blasted.
[02:55:03.741 --> 02:55:06.522]  I mean who knows how many psychotropics she's on.
[02:55:06.903 --> 02:55:07.783]  Who knows what she's doing.
[02:55:07.843 --> 02:55:09.064]  These are servants of evil.
[02:55:09.464 --> 02:55:10.065]  Thank you Stan.
[02:55:10.105 --> 02:55:10.585]  Great points.
[02:55:11.923 --> 02:55:13.044]  I think he's been home the longest now.
[02:55:14.104 --> 02:55:21.008]  That would be... That would be... Gosh, there's so many calls here.
[02:55:21.888 --> 02:55:22.769]  John in New York.
[02:55:22.789 --> 02:55:23.249]  You're on the air.
[02:55:23.269 --> 02:55:23.589]  Go ahead.
[02:55:23.609 --> 02:55:26.410]  It's good to speak with you, Alex.
[02:55:26.530 --> 02:55:27.111]  What an honor.
[02:55:27.131 --> 02:55:29.432]  I really appreciate everything you've done for us.
[02:55:29.472 --> 02:55:30.232]  I appreciate you, brother.
[02:55:30.312 --> 02:55:30.913]  Honored to talk to you.
[02:55:30.933 --> 02:55:31.433]  What's on your mind?
[02:55:32.156 --> 02:55:32.937]  Straight to the point.
[02:55:33.477 --> 02:55:36.298]  You have such a knowledge of history and conspiracies.
[02:55:36.879 --> 02:55:43.423]  The only time Hillary Clinton was honest was when she said, if that bastard wins, we're all going to hang.
[02:55:43.943 --> 02:55:46.424]  So why should we make her a liar on that, too?
[02:55:46.444 --> 02:55:49.686]  I'm looking out for her body double.
[02:55:49.946 --> 02:55:56.190]  I want that lady to be fake-suicided, and then Hillary thinks she's going to flip off and change her face.
[02:55:56.940 --> 02:56:01.322]  We know that that's what Hitler did, or at least there's a lot of conspiracies that he lived out the rest of his days.
[02:56:01.342 --> 02:56:02.142]  Sure, I'll say this.
[02:56:02.262 --> 02:56:08.264]  Just Trump beating Hillary and getting two Supreme Court nominees in that aren't total traitors is priceless.
[02:56:08.785 --> 02:56:09.605]  He's gotten so much done.
[02:56:09.625 --> 02:56:11.546]  Everybody else, bitches, he hasn't gotten everything else done.
[02:56:11.906 --> 02:56:12.606]  What do you expect?
[02:56:12.646 --> 02:56:13.426]  He's surrounded.
[02:56:13.906 --> 02:56:14.587]  It's incredible.
[02:56:15.607 --> 02:56:17.188]  Arrest her in front of the country.
[02:56:17.228 --> 02:56:18.028]  Televise it.
[02:56:18.288 --> 02:56:19.288]  Who's going to complain?
[02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:21.109]  Who's going to riot for her?
[02:56:21.129 --> 02:56:22.570]  No, Trump, we need to see leadership.
[02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:23.110]  Here's the problem.
[02:56:24.588 --> 02:56:30.631]  He's getting people from the swamp who lie to his face and say they're loyal, then they execute nothing because they're such cowards.
[02:56:31.011 --> 02:56:31.471]  Great points.
[02:56:31.491 --> 02:56:32.192]  Good to hear from you, John.
[02:56:32.212 --> 02:56:33.312]  Moving fast down to everybody.
[02:56:34.253 --> 02:56:36.334]  Let's go ahead and go to Grant in Iowa.
[02:56:36.374 --> 02:56:36.994]  Grant, you're on the air.
[02:56:37.014 --> 02:56:37.354]  Go ahead.
[02:56:39.035 --> 02:56:39.555]  Hey, Alex.
[02:56:39.595 --> 02:56:40.596]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:56:41.256 --> 02:56:45.118]  You were talking earlier about the 5% of farmers that are self-sufficient.
[02:56:46.118 --> 02:56:49.020]  And, you know, not only does that scare the elite, but
[02:56:49.733 --> 02:56:53.594]  It's rewarding to do this, and this ties right back into the money system.
[02:56:53.634 --> 02:56:57.015]  I'm so glad that Carlos brought that up a couple calls back.
[02:56:57.615 --> 02:57:00.776]  You know, Jesus only lost his temper that one time, and it was at Banksters.
[02:57:01.696 --> 02:57:06.858]  And you look at the money system, and Stellante talks about this, and I'm really anxious to hear what he has to say.
[02:57:07.638 --> 02:57:10.539]  And so does, you know, Ron Paul, and Rand Paul have been talking about this for a long time.
[02:57:11.119 --> 02:57:14.200]  The whole system is built on this borrow, borrow, borrow.
[02:57:14.793 --> 02:57:23.720]  And you know what it's like to own a business and, you know, small business owners know what it's like to have your own capital and be able to run your own ship and not have to constantly borrow and borrow and borrow.
[02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:27.863]  But our whole money system is set up that way and... Hold on!
[02:57:27.883 --> 02:57:28.343]  Stay there!
[02:57:28.363 --> 02:57:28.843]  Don't hang up!
[02:57:28.883 --> 02:57:29.524]  I'll come back to you, Grant.
[02:57:30.540 --> 02:57:32.181]  We've never taken a loan in Infowars.
[02:57:32.762 --> 02:57:34.223]  That's why it took 20 plus years to grow it.
[02:57:34.243 --> 02:57:35.785]  We just went right to the people.
[02:57:35.805 --> 02:57:38.087]  Because you go to these bankers, they want control.
[02:57:38.147 --> 02:57:39.007]  And it's all you.
[02:57:39.328 --> 02:57:42.851]  That's why if you shop with us for Christmas, you still get it in time before Christmas.
[02:57:43.271 --> 02:57:44.072]  Biggest sales ever.
[02:57:44.112 --> 02:57:46.054]  Free t-shirt, free shipping, store wide.
[02:57:46.734 --> 02:57:48.556]  Get a video, get a book, get a supplement.
[02:57:48.616 --> 02:57:49.256]  Give it as a gift.
[02:57:49.617 --> 02:57:50.838]  You fund us, we'll fight.
[02:57:53.882 --> 02:57:55.303]  2018 has come and it's almost gone.
[02:57:56.063 --> 02:57:58.003]  And it's been one incredible year.
[02:57:58.043 --> 02:57:59.244]  It's been a serious fight.
[02:57:59.804 --> 02:58:04.105]  But nationalism and populism and Christianity are coming back across the world.
[02:58:04.785 --> 02:58:08.186]  Thanks to God shining through you and your family.
[02:58:08.586 --> 02:58:10.307]  Thanks to you taking action.
[02:58:10.347 --> 02:58:13.527]  So I want to thank you for what you've done.
[02:58:14.308 --> 02:58:18.909]  You are literally the strength, the blood, the guts, the win in our sails.
[02:58:19.309 --> 02:58:19.669]  Literally.
[02:58:20.728 --> 02:58:22.528]  So I want to salute you and thank you for what you've done.
[02:58:22.548 --> 02:58:31.911]  And I want to encourage you to get great products, like the supplements and the water filtration, the air filtration, the Patriot apparel, all of it, at InfoWorks4.com.

[02:58:37.592 --> 02:58:39.133]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds.
[02:58:39.533 --> 02:58:46.695]  Go there, get great products that you and your family need that are game-changing, that are life-changing, and help us fund into the new year.
[02:58:47.135 --> 02:58:47.475]  Help us
[02:58:49.122 --> 02:58:54.007]  Stand against George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and the globalists.
[02:58:54.288 --> 02:58:59.053]  Help us stand in the way of their plans and their operations.
[02:58:59.173 --> 02:59:11.326]  At the same time, getting amazing products like BODY's Ultimate Tumor Formula, and X2 and X3 of Super Bowl Vitality, and Brain Force, and Lung Cleanse, and Knockout, and Alpha Power, and so many other amazing products.
[02:59:11.886 --> 02:59:16.371]  Whatever the best products are, we do the research, and that's what we bring you, because we want to work for you.
[02:59:16.711 --> 02:59:18.533]  We want it to be amazing, so you order it again.
[02:59:18.854 --> 02:59:23.359]  We treat you just like we want to be treated, because we respect you, and we appreciate you.
[02:59:23.639 --> 02:59:29.405]  You know, the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, and the Christ rule, lay down your life for others.
[02:59:30.410 --> 02:59:31.531]  Isn't that the world you want to live in?
[02:59:32.111 --> 02:59:34.652]  With a bunch of heroes, people that are ready to fight and stand up?
[02:59:34.672 --> 02:59:36.173]  Instead of a bunch of backstabbing cowards?
[02:59:36.913 --> 02:59:38.794]  That's the world that builds civilization.
[02:59:38.834 --> 02:59:40.075]  That's the world that builds it all.
[02:59:40.375 --> 02:59:44.758]  So when I treat you like I want to be treated, it's because I respect myself and I respect you.
[02:59:45.218 --> 02:59:46.178]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:59:46.439 --> 02:59:47.139]  Biggest sales ever.
[02:59:47.179 --> 02:59:49.400]  Free shipping storewide and so much more.
[02:59:49.420 --> 02:59:50.261]  But it's your last chance.
[02:59:50.301 --> 02:59:50.861]  Please take action.
[02:59:54.972 --> 02:59:59.054]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.554 --> 03:00:00.915]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:14.522]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:14.982 --> 03:00:16.663]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:17.524 --> 03:00:19.885]  On a long, lonesome highway
[03:00:34.451 --> 03:00:39.834]  Well, Trump represents individuals and groups that want prosperity.
[03:00:40.094 --> 03:00:41.735]  The establishment wants implosion.
[03:00:43.396 --> 03:00:49.419]  And they are grueling right now at the prospect of a worldwide depression that Ron Paul warned about today.
[03:00:49.459 --> 03:00:50.180]  We played the clip earlier.
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:57.221]  Grant in Iowa was making points about economic woes and where this is all going.
[03:00:57.701 --> 03:00:58.902]  They were pretty, pretty important.
[03:00:58.922 --> 03:00:59.882]  Go ahead, Grant, finish up.
[03:01:02.382 --> 03:01:10.464]  Yeah, just kind of talking about the banking system and how it's set on borrowing and, you know, there's no real reward for saving and being self-sufficient.
[03:01:11.004 --> 03:01:21.327]  People need to realize the importance of being self-sufficient because, you know, David Knight talked about there's 40%, I think it was a drudge link, 40% of people are leasing cars now and
[03:01:22.031 --> 03:01:26.915]  You know, everyone's just so used to borrowing and not being self-sufficient, when it's rewarding to be self-sufficient.
[03:01:27.195 --> 03:01:33.601]  And, you know, it's easy to get sucked into the black hole of capitalism and or consumerism.
[03:01:34.762 --> 03:01:36.823]  Because, you know, I just bought myself a watch.
[03:01:36.843 --> 03:01:38.485]  It's the first thing I've really bought myself this year.
[03:01:39.405 --> 03:01:44.489]  And, you know, you get all the ads for watches, and then you can easily get sucked into, oh, I'm going to look at watches.
[03:01:44.530 --> 03:01:46.191]  And it's like, I don't need to buy 10 watches.
[03:01:46.231 --> 03:01:47.232]  I just wanted one watch.
[03:01:47.292 --> 03:01:49.814]  Like, I don't need to get sucked into that black hole of just spending.
[03:01:53.220 --> 03:01:53.840]  Well, that's it.
[03:01:53.981 --> 03:01:58.464]  And if you've got some booming economy and you know you're going to make all this money expanding, do it.
[03:01:58.544 --> 03:02:00.365]  My goal is just getting the news out and the info out.
[03:02:00.385 --> 03:02:02.527]  But for the average business, you've got to know that.
[03:02:02.687 --> 03:02:10.393]  And the fact that they're trying to plunge the economy right now and cheerleading this is about killing the Trump recovery to discredit him, to remove him.
[03:02:10.993 --> 03:02:11.834]  And they're willing to do that.
[03:02:11.854 --> 03:02:20.240]  They're targeting other nationalist groups all over the world right now with recession or depression to get control, which I think is a serious crime.
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:20.881]  Thank you very much.
[03:02:22.352 --> 03:02:24.834]  And again, we're in a manipulated economy.
[03:02:24.854 --> 03:02:25.915]  We're in a controlled economy.
[03:02:26.595 --> 03:02:34.821]  And the fact that they're controlling it to hurt us electing nationalists shows you how dangerous it is to have a controlled economy.
[03:02:36.703 --> 03:02:40.065]  They brought in these controlled economies in the name of prosperity.
[03:02:40.085 --> 03:02:42.507]  That's what the Federal Reserve advertised 100 years ago.
[03:02:42.908 --> 03:02:43.508]  They haven't done it.
[03:02:46.410 --> 03:02:47.451]  All right, who's up next here?
[03:02:47.471 --> 03:02:49.893]  We've got so many great callers, there's so little time to go to them.
[03:02:50.919 --> 03:02:52.300]  Who's been on the longest here?
[03:02:52.860 --> 03:02:54.381]  Cameron in Florida.
[03:02:55.221 --> 03:02:56.162]  Cameron in Florida.
[03:02:56.482 --> 03:02:59.123]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:02:59.143 --> 03:03:00.904]  Yes, brother Alex Jones, we love you so much.
[03:03:00.944 --> 03:03:03.526]  We're all praying for you and our president and all other fellow patrons.
[03:03:04.146 --> 03:03:09.429]  I appreciate you speaking truth to Gavin McGinnis and telling him that they hate you because you are good.
[03:03:09.489 --> 03:03:13.731]  And people need to really open up their eyes that people hate us because we are good.
[03:03:14.051 --> 03:03:16.293]  And we're talking about the yellow vest protest and stuff.
[03:03:16.353 --> 03:03:20.275]  I'm interested to see if the Islamists start clashing with him over there in France.
[03:03:20.775 --> 03:03:23.258]  Well, there's no doubt we're entering the season of resistance.
[03:03:46.104 --> 03:03:48.286]  Because the season of awakening is here.
[03:03:48.846 --> 03:03:50.428]  It's a very, very explosive time.
[03:03:50.448 --> 03:03:51.529]  Great points, Cameron.
[03:03:51.569 --> 03:03:52.109]  Thanks for holding.
[03:03:52.469 --> 03:03:55.892]  I can talk to each caller for an hour, but we have limited time with this many phone lines.
[03:03:57.134 --> 03:03:59.275]  Man, I got Mongoose in Texas.
[03:04:00.176 --> 03:04:01.637]  Mongoose, real fast in Texas.
[03:04:01.657 --> 03:04:02.018]  Go ahead.
[03:04:03.579 --> 03:04:04.039]  Hey, Alex.
[03:04:04.079 --> 03:04:05.261]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:04:05.281 --> 03:04:06.281]  Sorry, doing a great job.
[03:04:06.301 --> 03:04:11.886]  Real quick, what we need to be careful of is a future that looks like South Africa.
[03:04:12.567 --> 03:04:13.688]  Those people are
[03:04:15.243 --> 03:04:16.884]  They're under attack, plain and simple.
[03:04:17.605 --> 03:04:18.525]  We have to be careful of that.
[03:04:18.685 --> 03:04:19.606]  They drop the rhetoric.
[03:04:19.786 --> 03:04:21.847]  They label us, you know, evil.
[03:04:22.228 --> 03:04:24.169]  We got to combat that mindset.
[03:04:24.189 --> 03:04:29.332]  Oh yeah, once whole groups are demonized like Nazi Germany, people better understand that this is a plan.
[03:04:31.573 --> 03:04:32.374]  So that was one thing.
[03:04:32.434 --> 03:04:40.679]  Another thing, Gruber, is he getting us set up for a... because what they do is they drop a seed and they water that seed.
[03:04:41.563 --> 03:04:42.984]  And so what is he getting ready to do?
[03:04:43.404 --> 03:04:45.104]  Is this to nullify our Supreme Court?
[03:04:47.145 --> 03:04:47.525]  I agree.
[03:04:47.545 --> 03:04:48.786]  So what do you think he's about to pull?
[03:04:50.066 --> 03:04:51.267]  Oh, he's just dropping the seed.
[03:04:51.607 --> 03:04:52.487]  He's dropping the seed.
[03:04:52.527 --> 03:04:59.210]  And he's going to let that seed grow and be watered by all of the, just the collective ignorance of people.
[03:04:59.250 --> 03:05:00.210]  I'm not being rude.
[03:05:00.450 --> 03:05:01.110]  No, no, you're right.
[03:05:01.130 --> 03:05:01.571]  You're right.
[03:05:01.611 --> 03:05:02.791]  Coming up, Gerald Filente.
[03:05:03.431 --> 03:05:03.931]  Look at that.
[03:05:03.951 --> 03:05:06.673]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear.
[03:05:06.693 --> 03:05:08.053]  That's because it's been denatured.
[03:05:08.093 --> 03:05:08.973]  It's been watered down.
[03:05:09.273 --> 03:05:10.034]  We didn't do that.
[03:05:11.684 --> 03:05:15.787]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[03:05:16.208 --> 03:05:17.869]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:05:18.450 --> 03:05:27.016]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:05:27.477 --> 03:05:29.158]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:05:29.198 --> 03:05:30.299]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:33.522]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:05:33.562 --> 03:05:34.663]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:05:35.443 --> 03:05:38.205]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:05:46.919 --> 03:05:47.319]  Give it up!
[03:05:47.379 --> 03:05:53.405]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:05:53.425 --> 03:05:58.290]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil.
[03:05:58.750 --> 03:06:01.853]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[03:06:16.441 --> 03:06:18.569]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:06:18.609 --> 03:06:20.475]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:23.955 --> 03:06:32.177]  I could not think of a better time to have Gerald Cilente, one of the top trends forecasters in the world, TrendsResearch.com on Twitter, at Gerald Cilente on.
[03:06:32.598 --> 03:06:33.778]  He's taking over right now.
[03:06:34.298 --> 03:06:35.658]  Hey, I took like 15 calls.
[03:06:36.459 --> 03:06:41.640]  Sorry to all other callers, don't have time to get to you, but I appreciate Dr. Kelly and everybody else that's holding, like Leonard.
[03:06:41.820 --> 03:06:45.401]  Call me back tomorrow, I'll get you on with the Tuesday transmission.
[03:06:45.421 --> 03:06:47.022]  Gonna have Owen Schroer with me in the studio.
[03:06:47.462 --> 03:06:48.522]  Bunch of big guests this week.
[03:06:48.562 --> 03:06:50.943]  Roger Stone's flying in to co-host this week.
[03:06:52.315 --> 03:06:53.536]  Listen, Trump's not perfect.
[03:06:53.636 --> 03:06:54.117]  I'm not perfect.
[03:06:54.697 --> 03:06:56.719]  But he's trying to bring power back to the nation-state.
[03:06:58.161 --> 03:06:59.522]  And he's trying to boost the economy.
[03:07:00.903 --> 03:07:02.545]  With a bubble, to counter the Chinese bubble.
[03:07:02.585 --> 03:07:07.750]  But the globalists are targeting that bubble, and are successfully popping it right now.
[03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:10.492]  And they're playing major games with the stock market.
[03:07:11.333 --> 03:07:17.359]  Gruber has come out, it's on Infowars.com, the architect of Obamacare, and said the Supreme Court knows nothing about the Constitution.
[03:07:18.757 --> 03:07:19.998]  Yeah, these are his latest statements.
[03:07:20.038 --> 03:07:21.839]  He says, thank God you're so stupid, by the way.
[03:07:22.479 --> 03:07:26.501]  So Gerald is the guy to get into what we're about to face.
[03:07:26.581 --> 03:07:30.082]  Ron Paul, he played it earlier, said, the stock market crash 50%?
[03:07:30.142 --> 03:07:31.483]  We're worse than 929.
[03:07:31.843 --> 03:07:34.405]  And I agree because people were self-sufficient.
[03:07:34.965 --> 03:07:36.626]  Half the public was self-sufficient in 1929.
[03:07:39.060 --> 03:07:40.080]  5% are today.
[03:07:40.821 --> 03:07:45.402]  So Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster, takes you over for the next 53 minutes.
[03:07:45.442 --> 03:07:48.363]  And then Owen Schroer and the War Room.
[03:07:48.663 --> 03:07:50.803]  Gerald, thanks for co-hosting.
[03:07:50.863 --> 03:07:51.323]  Thank you.
[03:07:51.383 --> 03:07:59.046]  And thank you for all that you do, Alex, and all that InfoWars does and everyone there to keep people aware and awake of what's really going on.
[03:07:59.886 --> 03:08:06.868]  As for the markets, on September 19th of this year, we sent out a trend alert to our subscribers.
[03:08:06.928 --> 03:08:08.108]  And I also mentioned it
[03:08:08.883 --> 03:08:14.546]  On Infowars a number of times that we're entering into an economic 9-11.
[03:08:15.987 --> 03:08:24.551]  And despite what the media keeps saying that it's about trade wars and tariffs, we kept saying that's a lot of baloney.
[03:08:25.511 --> 03:08:33.796]  You know, if if there was a Democrat in office now trying to renegotiate the China deals, it would be a whole different story.
[03:08:35.256 --> 03:08:38.358]  And all you have to do is go back to ancient history.
[03:08:38.968 --> 03:08:39.548]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:08:40.149 --> 03:08:40.649]  Back around 2000.
[03:08:40.909 --> 03:08:42.309]  2000 and... Yeah.
[03:08:44.410 --> 03:08:47.531]  It's about this time of the year over in Seattle.
[03:08:47.952 --> 03:08:49.212]  The Battle of Seattle.
[03:08:49.992 --> 03:09:01.577]  Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in protest of Bill Clinton bringing China and others into the World Trade Organization.
[03:09:02.437 --> 03:09:05.919]  Because they knew that we'd lose the jobs that we have lost.
[03:09:07.339 --> 03:09:08.560]  3.5 million of them to China.
[03:09:09.375 --> 03:09:12.336]  Since they joined in 2001.
[03:09:12.796 --> 03:09:20.638]  They officially became WTO member in 2001, just two weeks after 9-11 when no one was paying attention.
[03:09:21.499 --> 03:09:23.379]  You go back to the 1990s.
[03:09:23.759 --> 03:09:25.600]  This is communist China.
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:27.060]  Let's not forget.
[03:09:27.080 --> 03:09:30.462]  And look how they taught us to hate them commies, right?
[03:09:30.922 --> 03:09:31.762]  I'm a guy that was
[03:09:32.540 --> 03:09:35.482]  Draft bait age during the Vietnam War.
[03:09:35.843 --> 03:09:36.964]  I know it all too well.
[03:09:37.344 --> 03:09:39.586]  We got to stop those commies, I tell you.
[03:09:40.106 --> 03:09:47.212]  Because before you know it, they're going to take over Asia and those dominoes, they're going to keep falling until they hit the shores of California.
[03:09:47.592 --> 03:09:48.493]  That's not a lie.
[03:09:48.533 --> 03:09:50.094]  That's the lies that they were telling.
[03:09:50.714 --> 03:09:59.101]  But it's OK to do business with the world's biggest, greatest by far, and now richest communist country that
[03:10:00.751 --> 03:10:02.372]  Marx could have ever dreamed of.
[03:10:03.713 --> 03:10:12.958]  So going back to the protests, back in the Battle of Seattle, what derailed it were the agents provocateur.
[03:10:13.659 --> 03:10:29.228]  This was a huge peaceful protest, and all of a sudden you see these guys in perfect shape with black masks on and hoods, smashing windows and burning cars, and that discredited the whole movement.
[03:10:31.587 --> 03:10:58.642]  And now here we are, 18 years later, middle class shrinking, and three people, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Warren Buffett, have more money than half of America's population, more dough than 160 million people.
[03:10:58.662 --> 03:10:59.803]  Imagine that.
[03:11:00.885 --> 03:11:02.406]  You look at Oxfam's report.
[03:11:03.306 --> 03:11:10.030]  Eight cats got more dough than half the world's population combined.
[03:11:11.151 --> 03:11:11.811]  Imagine that.
[03:11:12.492 --> 03:11:14.093]  So now let's go back to the markets.
[03:11:14.993 --> 03:11:22.337]  When on September 19th, 2018, we forecast an economic 9-11.
[03:11:22.757 --> 03:11:25.739]  It's right there in black and white.
[03:11:26.179 --> 03:11:30.062]  This is two days before the markets peaked on September 21st.
[03:11:32.901 --> 03:11:35.922]  It's not about trade or tariffs.
[03:11:37.282 --> 03:11:48.745]  All of Trump's tariffs on China equal the grand total of 0.7% of their gross domestic product.
[03:11:49.945 --> 03:11:51.686]  It's interest rates.
[03:11:53.166 --> 03:11:55.987]  That's what's bringing down the global economy.
[03:11:56.427 --> 03:11:59.948]  The cheap money, that monetary myth,
[03:12:00.666 --> 03:12:05.992]  That they kept shooting into the markets following the Panic of 08.
[03:12:08.795 --> 03:12:13.480]  People say to me, well, Salenti, you said that this thing was going to get worse in 2012.
[03:12:13.640 --> 03:12:18.605]  Yeah, yeah, we know that you coined the term the Panic of 08 in 2007.
[03:12:23.149 --> 03:12:25.831]  Yeah, yeah, you call the dot-com crash.
[03:12:25.891 --> 03:12:28.373]  It's in your Trends Journal in October 1999.
[03:12:29.294 --> 03:12:32.976]  You said it would crash the dot-coms by the second quarter of 2000.
[03:12:34.057 --> 03:12:35.878]  But you got it wrong after that!
[03:12:37.299 --> 03:12:38.060]  I got it wrong.
[03:12:39.361 --> 03:12:45.225]  Because I didn't know they'd come up with zero and negative interest rate policy and quantitative easing.
[03:12:45.645 --> 03:12:51.930]  I didn't know that they would take our money and give it to the big corporations and the big banksters.
[03:12:53.641 --> 03:12:55.863]  And that's all it's done is enrich the big.
[03:12:56.643 --> 03:13:01.827]  The multinationals got bigger, and those too-big-to-fail banks, they got much bigger.
[03:13:04.168 --> 03:13:20.440]  So, going back to the economic 9-11, its interest rates, during the campaign of Slick Willie Clinton back in 1992, had their people focus on one issue.
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:23.182]  Quote, it's the economy, stupid.
[03:13:23.877 --> 03:13:26.918]  So anytime they go off script, boom, back into the economy.
[03:13:27.358 --> 03:13:35.079]  Because we were getting over the fallout from the 1987 stock market crash.
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:39.600]  It's interest rates, stupid.
[03:13:40.540 --> 03:13:42.981]  And not only in the United States, worldwide.
[03:13:44.201 --> 03:13:45.141]  Look at the data.
[03:13:46.422 --> 03:13:47.402]  Open your eyes.
[03:13:47.882 --> 03:13:49.982]  Hey, some just came out of China.
[03:13:51.022 --> 03:13:52.603]  Oh yeah, retail sales?
[03:13:54.517 --> 03:13:55.177]  The worst since 2003.
[03:13:55.758 --> 03:13:59.060]  Auto sales?
[03:14:00.921 --> 03:14:04.163]  The biggest slump since the 1990s.
[03:14:04.703 --> 03:14:05.824]  The housing market.
[03:14:06.444 --> 03:14:07.505]  Luxury goods.
[03:14:08.806 --> 03:14:10.227]  Industrial production.
[03:14:11.908 --> 03:14:13.448]  Everything down.
[03:14:15.150 --> 03:14:17.671]  Nothing to do with trade wars or tariffs.
[03:14:18.672 --> 03:14:20.833]  It has to do with that bubble bursting.
[03:14:22.657 --> 03:14:36.006]  The economic 9-11 terrorist strike is the $250 trillion in cheap money that boosted the equity markets around the world.
[03:14:36.686 --> 03:14:38.007]  And now it's drying up.
[03:14:39.208 --> 03:14:45.252]  And just last week, we saw over there in the ECB, the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi.
[03:14:46.513 --> 03:14:49.635]  Yeah, the former Goldman Sachs gang head.
[03:14:51.539 --> 03:15:01.086]  The European division, before they put him as head of the central bank, saying that they weren't going to issue any more quantitative easing.
[03:15:02.587 --> 03:15:03.368]  A scam!
[03:15:03.388 --> 03:15:09.412]  It was supposed to be a trillion bucks for several months.
[03:15:09.452 --> 03:15:18.059]  It became three trillion for almost four years, buying corporate bonds and government bonds.
[03:15:18.879 --> 03:15:19.900]  And now it's drying up.
[03:15:22.541 --> 03:15:25.443]  As is the European economy.
[03:15:26.684 --> 03:15:27.924]  In a slowdown now.
[03:15:29.785 --> 03:15:31.186]  One after another.
[03:15:32.007 --> 03:15:34.148]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:15:35.108 --> 03:15:38.931]  An economic 9-11 is ready to strike.
[03:15:39.531 --> 03:15:43.013]  Prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:15:43.593 --> 03:15:44.274]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:46.707 --> 03:15:50.856]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:15:51.598 --> 03:15:53.041]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:16:02.625 --> 03:16:13.369]  In the last few months, you have seen InfoWars offer the biggest sales in our history because Soros and the Globalists are all over the news trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut down our shopping carts, trying to destroy us.
[03:16:13.970 --> 03:16:17.371]  They have kicked us off almost every media outlet out there because we're loyal Americans.
[03:16:17.411 --> 03:16:29.576]  But thanks to you supporting us, we're on more radio stations and more TV stations than ever because these stations understand that Trump and myself and many others are being persecuted by the Globalists, by the Leftists, by the Hollywood scum.
[03:16:30.461 --> 03:16:32.122]  But InfoWars is in your hands.
[03:16:32.182 --> 03:16:39.888]  So this Christmas, only a few days until Christmas left, I want to just thank all the viewers and listeners for your support, for your prayers, and for being in this together.
[03:16:40.048 --> 03:16:49.374]  And just to remind you again, please share the articles, please share the videos from NewsWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com because those get around the censors easier than InfoWars.com.
[03:16:49.635 --> 03:16:55.179]  But whatever you do, realize this country and this planet is in a fight for its life against the globalists and
[03:16:56.272 --> 03:17:09.016]  It is financing that allows us to do what we do, and that's why it is a total win for everybody, because you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, and at the same time, you help fund this operation that is fearlessly fighting the globalists as hard as we can.
[03:17:09.536 --> 03:17:13.557]  Now, we've sold out of some of our best-selling items, but we've still got most of our best-selling items in.
[03:17:14.077 --> 03:17:22.720]  That's why I am extending the 12 days of Christmas for four more days, because we're guaranteed up to about the 19th to be able to ship to anybody in the continental United States before Christmas.
[03:17:23.280 --> 03:17:24.301]  At InfoWarpStore.com.
[03:17:24.581 --> 03:17:25.722]  But get your orders in.
[03:17:25.762 --> 03:17:28.044]  Don't fight those crowds and support the InfoWarp.
[03:17:28.424 --> 03:17:33.107]  All the sales the last 12 days, 50-75% off, is back.
[03:17:33.187 --> 03:17:34.228]  Free shipping is still there.
[03:17:34.268 --> 03:17:35.169]  Double Patriot Points.
[03:17:35.669 --> 03:17:38.571]  And we have even bigger sales on four new items.
[03:17:38.891 --> 03:17:43.395]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, MycoZX, the t-shirts, all of it.
[03:17:43.435 --> 03:17:44.516]  Just go check out the sales.
[03:17:44.896 --> 03:17:46.217]  There's too many to break them all down.
[03:17:46.637 --> 03:17:50.020]  Get your orders in by the 19th, so you're guaranteed to get it on or before Christmas.
[03:17:50.760 --> 03:17:52.482]  And thank you again, all, for your support.
[03:17:52.782 --> 03:17:54.964]  We're extending this sale until the 19th.
[03:17:55.504 --> 03:18:00.088]  And again, whatever you do, just spread the word about InfoWars.com, and we're going to beat the globals together.
[03:18:00.148 --> 03:18:00.488]  Thank you.
[03:18:02.209 --> 03:18:08.675]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:18:10.376 --> 03:18:11.817]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:18:12.077 --> 03:18:17.002]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping storewide, 50% to 75% off double Patriot points.
[03:18:18.149 --> 03:18:24.098]  Let's extend that sale but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:18:24.859 --> 03:18:30.948]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free coiled silver iodine fortified super blue that we make like three bucks on at this sale.
[03:18:31.348 --> 03:18:32.530]  You'll get a free gift
[03:18:33.291 --> 03:18:59.440]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[03:19:00.703 --> 03:19:07.028]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[03:19:07.449 --> 03:19:09.210]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[03:19:09.270 --> 03:19:14.234]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[03:19:14.675 --> 03:19:15.195]  It's big.
[03:19:15.716 --> 03:19:16.116]  It's bad.
[03:19:16.576 --> 03:19:21.781]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[03:19:21.821 --> 03:19:24.103]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[03:19:24.543 --> 03:19:27.746]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[03:19:28.346 --> 03:19:29.307]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:19:29.327 --> 03:19:30.508]  That's been going on for over a month.
[03:19:31.269 --> 03:19:32.490]  50 to 75% off.
[03:19:32.530 --> 03:19:33.531]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[03:19:34.599 --> 03:19:35.540]  The Double Patriot points.
[03:19:35.560 --> 03:19:36.481]  That's what happened in about a week.
[03:19:36.821 --> 03:19:43.467]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[03:19:43.907 --> 03:19:48.311]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:19:48.331 --> 03:19:50.213]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:19:50.473 --> 03:19:52.275]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:19:52.475 --> 03:19:54.517]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:54.697 --> 03:19:58.701]  And from myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:20:06.741 --> 03:20:09.423]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:29.864 --> 03:20:35.805]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:36.445 --> 03:20:40.646]  And now, your host, Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:42.306 --> 03:20:44.787]  Hey, thanks a lot.
[03:20:44.827 --> 03:20:48.628]  And thank you for having me on and hosting InfoWars.
[03:20:49.648 --> 03:20:53.889]  What a show, what a program, all that they bring, all that they do.
[03:20:54.588 --> 03:21:01.512]  And all the pressure they're under to make it happen as the deep state tries to silence them.
[03:21:01.592 --> 03:21:09.996]  So do what you can to support them, especially during this Christmas season, because they're bringing back all their un...
[03:21:10.666 --> 03:21:15.889]  Precedented Christmas specials, but it's only for a limited time.
[03:21:15.909 --> 03:21:26.814]  Over the past 12 days at InfoWars.com, they've launched some of their biggest specials ever to help you stock up for Christmas and support InfoWars.
[03:21:27.554 --> 03:21:30.416]  These specials were such massive loss leaders,
[03:21:31.112 --> 03:21:48.835]  They could only promote them for 24 hours, but now they're bringing them back all, all these Christmas Mega Specials at Infowarsstores.com for a limited time, and many are already completely selling out.
[03:21:49.716 --> 03:21:51.896]  And some of them are Brain Force for 55% off.
[03:21:51.936 --> 03:21:53.056]  Bodies for 60% off.
[03:21:58.553 --> 03:22:04.217]  And the last run of mail, Supermail Vitality, with 55% off.
[03:22:04.557 --> 03:22:09.020]  Boy, I'm glad I really stocked up on Supermail Vitality.
[03:22:09.520 --> 03:22:10.481]  Keeps me going.
[03:22:11.101 --> 03:22:13.243]  And I got a boogie before the lights go out.
[03:22:13.323 --> 03:22:18.786]  So please do what you can to keep InfoWars out there alive and well.
[03:22:19.507 --> 03:22:22.709]  And doing so, you keep yourself alive and well.
[03:22:24.270 --> 03:22:26.191]  So, I was talking about the economy.
[03:22:26.917 --> 03:22:28.518]  And the economic 9-11.
[03:22:28.538 --> 03:22:41.665]  You know, right after, right before the midterm elections and after the midterm elections, a lot of reports came out and said, what does it mean at a midterm elections and how does that affect the stock markets?
[03:22:42.325 --> 03:22:44.426]  This is from the Financial Times.
[03:22:45.447 --> 03:22:46.908]  And it goes on to say that
[03:22:54.884 --> 03:23:04.932]  What they do is show that after the midterms, stocks usually go up.
[03:23:06.754 --> 03:23:07.574]  Not this time.
[03:23:08.755 --> 03:23:09.656]  They're going down.
[03:23:11.638 --> 03:23:13.239]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:23:15.221 --> 03:23:22.607]  I want to read you some of the headlines over the past several days.
[03:23:24.602 --> 03:23:33.984]  That shows the negative drift of what's going on around the world and at home regarding the economy.
[03:23:36.085 --> 03:23:38.705]  IMF war and storm clouds are gathering.
[03:23:39.705 --> 03:23:41.326]  The next financial crisis.
[03:23:43.926 --> 03:23:47.247]  So the crisis prevention is incomplete.
[03:23:49.648 --> 03:23:50.568]  As we have put it,
[03:23:51.539 --> 03:24:01.264]  Fix the roof while the sun shines, but like many of you, I see storm clouds building and fear the work on crisis prevention is incomplete.
[03:24:06.126 --> 03:24:08.787]  IMF economists warns of slowing growth.
[03:24:12.289 --> 03:24:16.031]  They're warning that global growth is slowing and the U.S.
[03:24:16.191 --> 03:24:18.292]  will likely feel the drag as well.
[03:24:22.196 --> 03:24:22.756]  Here we go.
[03:24:23.936 --> 03:24:26.597]  New figures point to a broader slowdown.
[03:24:26.637 --> 03:24:34.719]  The Eurozone slowdown was broader than previously suspected in the three months through September.
[03:24:35.720 --> 03:24:35.840]  Oh.
[03:24:37.240 --> 03:24:37.880]  Eurozone?
[03:24:38.300 --> 03:24:40.361]  Hey, take a trip over there to Japan.
[03:24:41.021 --> 03:24:43.922]  You see their third quarter GDP numbers?
[03:24:44.982 --> 03:24:48.303]  They're only down a minus 2.5 percent.
[03:24:50.396 --> 03:24:53.018]  That's despite negative interest rates.
[03:24:53.739 --> 03:25:00.264]  That's despite the Bank of Japan sitting on $5 trillion worth of debt.
[03:25:00.464 --> 03:25:04.787]  Bigger than the entire Japanese GDP.
[03:25:06.889 --> 03:25:08.130]  Negative bond yields.
[03:25:08.190 --> 03:25:08.730]  That's right.
[03:25:08.750 --> 03:25:09.711]  You know what that means?
[03:25:10.472 --> 03:25:17.637]  You're dumb enough to buy a 10-year bond, hold it for 10 years, and after 10 years, we'll give you less than what you bought it for.
[03:25:17.657 --> 03:25:20.099]  You know who's buying them.
[03:25:20.629 --> 03:25:21.450]  The Bank of Japan.
[03:25:22.350 --> 03:25:25.473]  But that's not keeping their markets alive.
[03:25:26.854 --> 03:25:28.976]  Take a look right now as we speak.
[03:25:29.296 --> 03:25:38.004]  The Dow is down over 400 points into correction territory.
[03:25:40.866 --> 03:25:42.007]  That means it's down more than 10%.
[03:25:42.728 --> 03:25:46.351]  Had an 8% gain this year.
[03:25:46.791 --> 03:25:47.011]  Foof!
[03:25:47.391 --> 03:25:47.892]  Wiped out.
[03:25:50.086 --> 03:25:57.687]  The Russell small cap, down in bear territory, down over 20%.
[03:25:57.747 --> 03:26:07.209]  The S&P, the NASDAQ, down in correction territory, down over 10%.
[03:26:09.509 --> 03:26:13.530]  The Asia-Pacific markets, down over 25%.
[03:26:14.170 --> 03:26:19.271]  The Shanghai Composite Index, China, the world's second largest
[03:26:20.074 --> 03:26:22.676]  Economy, down over 25%.
[03:26:22.736 --> 03:26:31.401]  The Emerging Markets Index, down over 25%.
[03:26:32.722 --> 03:26:45.110]  The DAX 600 and the FTSE 100, representing the European stocks, down over 10%.
[03:26:45.670 --> 03:26:46.891]  Correction territory.
[03:26:50.987 --> 03:26:53.568]  This week, the Federal Reserve is going to be meeting.
[03:26:56.929 --> 03:26:58.030]  Go back to September.
[03:26:59.851 --> 03:27:09.355]  The bet was that they're going to raise interest rates in December and three to four times next year.
[03:27:11.235 --> 03:27:12.796]  Those bets are off the table.
[03:27:14.997 --> 03:27:19.999]  There was a zero bet in Fed Futures that
[03:27:21.991 --> 03:27:27.375]  The Fed would not raise interest rates this week, going back to September when they were betting into December.
[03:27:28.316 --> 03:27:32.158]  Now there's a 35% chance that they won't raise rates.
[03:27:33.199 --> 03:27:34.100]  And maybe they won't.
[03:27:35.281 --> 03:27:38.263]  Because the world cannot take real money.
[03:27:38.323 --> 03:27:41.565]  They need the cheap monetary meth to keep it going.
[03:27:42.626 --> 03:27:49.071]  The ECB announced last week, the European Central Bank, they're not going to raise rates.
[03:27:51.860 --> 03:27:57.521]  Until maybe, maybe the summer of 2019.
[03:28:00.542 --> 03:28:04.603]  Canada, they didn't raise their rates and neither did Australia.
[03:28:05.063 --> 03:28:08.104]  Oh, check out that Australian housing market.
[03:28:08.724 --> 03:28:09.004]  Poof!
[03:28:09.684 --> 03:28:11.945]  Going down in Sydney and Melbourne.
[03:28:12.945 --> 03:28:15.206]  Yep, almost double digit numbers.
[03:28:17.927 --> 03:28:19.567]  The world can't take real money.
[03:28:20.856 --> 03:28:22.517]  They need that monetary meth.
[03:28:22.838 --> 03:28:22.958]  Oh!
[03:28:23.839 --> 03:28:26.621]  And what's the opposite side of that?
[03:28:27.361 --> 03:28:27.762]  Gold.
[03:28:29.243 --> 03:28:34.848]  And gold is hovering around that $1,250 an ounce mark.
[03:28:37.530 --> 03:28:38.671]  Watch gold prices.
[03:28:40.472 --> 03:28:43.675]  Gold should be going up as the markets go down.
[03:28:44.455 --> 03:28:45.937]  We don't give financial advice.
[03:28:47.538 --> 03:28:48.319]  Think for yourself.
[03:28:48.939 --> 03:28:49.800]  We'll be back in a bit.
[03:29:02.865 --> 03:29:03.234]  Yeah.
[03:29:10.549 --> 03:29:10.849]  Boom!
[03:29:10.989 --> 03:29:12.651]  This is right at the end of the election.
[03:29:13.411 --> 03:29:16.334]  Etgarryfrancisnextnewsnet is now number one.
[03:29:16.534 --> 03:29:18.416]  And that's tumblrlabs.com.
[03:29:18.696 --> 03:29:21.739]  Number one ahead of the Alex Jones Channel on YouTube.
[03:29:21.959 --> 03:29:24.301]  That was number two, Young Turks, number three, Fox News, number four.
[03:29:24.401 --> 03:29:25.762]  CNN is down at seven.
[03:29:25.822 --> 03:29:27.624]  That's why they had to get me banned.
[03:29:27.644 --> 03:29:29.005]  It's why they've shadow banned you.
[03:29:29.165 --> 03:29:30.106]  Because they're pathetic.
[03:29:30.266 --> 03:29:32.067]  So these guys can't compete with us.
[03:29:32.087 --> 03:29:33.709]  They're really monsters, Gary.
[03:29:33.729 --> 03:29:34.770]  And now the system's betting
[03:29:35.290 --> 03:29:41.652]  That by blocking us on all these platforms, blocking you, dialing you back, that somehow they're going to win, but that isn't happening, is it?
[03:29:42.052 --> 03:29:53.316]  When you look at the social media elements and you see what just happened, the new email threads that have been released regarding the actual discussion of censorship of conservatives, it's terrifying.
[03:29:53.536 --> 03:30:03.139]  If you take a look at the social media statistics around that time of the election, your channel, my channel, Mark Dice's channel, alternative and independent news channels, conservative news,
[03:30:03.699 --> 03:30:03.859]  I don't
[03:30:27.463 --> 03:30:27.903]  I think?
[03:30:48.624 --> 03:30:57.009]  Let's be clear, you put in Gary Franchi or you put in Tucker Carlson or Alex Jones, and it's been in the emails, our names, it sends you to Trevor Noah.
[03:30:57.069 --> 03:30:58.410]  It sends you to Stephen Colbert.
[03:30:58.450 --> 03:31:00.491]  It sends you to CNN.
[03:31:00.551 --> 03:31:09.777]  They literally, on Google, on YouTube, send our people in the top 50 pages only to their crap to give them a boost.
[03:31:09.897 --> 03:31:10.958]  But the boost didn't work.
[03:31:11.078 --> 03:31:11.698]  Now it's gone.
[03:31:11.798 --> 03:31:12.439]  It's incredible.
[03:31:13.752 --> 03:31:18.296]  Yeah, we're seeing an uptick as of late, which is encouraging.
[03:31:18.356 --> 03:31:24.541]  I think we're going to hit a million subscribers, God willing, in the next 60 to 90 days.
[03:31:25.021 --> 03:31:27.644]  And we're blessed to have that.
[03:31:28.244 --> 03:31:31.467]  But, you know, like you, you know that can be taken away at any moment.
[03:31:31.527 --> 03:31:38.072]  I go to sleep every night and I think to myself, I'm going to wake up in the morning with an email saying, sorry, you know, we're shutting you down.
[03:31:39.548 --> 03:31:46.971]  I mean, we've connected with some high hitters, some heavy hitters in the multi-channel space who help us and support us, you know, as advocates.
[03:31:47.831 --> 03:31:53.974]  But at the end of the day, you know, you have a platform you've built for so many years and you can still continue to push forward.
[03:31:55.274 --> 03:31:57.576]  And I thank you for that, you're an inspiration for so many.
[03:31:58.036 --> 03:32:04.362]  But the reality is, is that they are manipulating the truth, they're manipulating the algorithms, and we have to push forward.
[03:32:04.762 --> 03:32:09.726]  Like, even though we have hundreds of thousands of subscribers, a lot of those people don't even get notifications.
[03:32:10.967 --> 03:32:11.547]  Stay hungry.
[03:32:11.587 --> 03:32:12.628]  They've got to know it's a war.
[03:32:12.708 --> 03:32:16.149]  It's up to the viewers and listeners who are awesome to take action exactly as you said.
[03:32:16.270 --> 03:32:24.794]  We have to use the big globalist platformers, build our own platforms, and then all work together synergistically to defeat the censorship of these draconian activities.
[03:32:25.314 --> 03:32:28.996]  So at Twitter for now, at Gary Franchi, also at Next News Network.
[03:32:29.356 --> 03:32:31.597]  How else can people find the great work you're doing daily?
[03:32:32.563 --> 03:32:34.244]  Well, they can go to YouTube.
[03:32:34.324 --> 03:32:38.006]  It's YouTube.com slash Next News Network and they can find us there.
[03:32:38.806 --> 03:32:40.908]  You know, we put out about 15 reports a day.
[03:32:41.628 --> 03:32:44.930]  We cover a lot of the stuff that we see all over the conservative news.
[03:32:44.970 --> 03:32:46.511]  And you're doing a great job.
[03:32:46.691 --> 03:32:47.951]  Gary, come down in Austin.
[03:32:47.991 --> 03:32:48.752]  I'll fly you down here.
[03:32:48.772 --> 03:32:49.312]  Be in studio.
[03:32:49.332 --> 03:32:50.533]  Say hi to your wife and kids for me.
[03:32:50.793 --> 03:32:53.374]  You've been doing a great job for 15 plus years and we love you.
[03:32:53.474 --> 03:32:53.975]  God bless you.
[03:32:54.055 --> 03:32:54.495]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:33:06.182 --> 03:33:08.793]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.460 --> 03:33:28.061]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:28.381 --> 03:33:37.527]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:40.909 --> 03:33:42.350]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[03:33:42.510 --> 03:33:49.334]  Great being on The Alex Jones Show, InfoWars, and for all they do to keep you informed.
[03:33:50.288 --> 03:33:58.917]  And against the tide of fake news and junk news and dumbed down news that just floods the airwaves.
[03:33:59.638 --> 03:34:03.001]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:34:03.181 --> 03:34:08.566]  It's Christmas time and they have their unprecedented Christmas sale going on.
[03:34:09.107 --> 03:34:10.148]  So check it out.
[03:34:10.508 --> 03:34:11.810]  They got great products.
[03:34:12.620 --> 03:34:21.785]  I left off that Supermail Vitality, which they're running out of, and I just bought a whole load of it, because I gotta keep that vitality going.
[03:34:21.805 --> 03:34:24.107]  You know, I'm a young cat anymore.
[03:34:24.147 --> 03:34:25.467]  I need that extra boost.
[03:34:26.428 --> 03:34:27.248]  And what else they have?
[03:34:27.309 --> 03:34:31.131]  Ultimate Bone Broth, for 55% off.
[03:34:31.271 --> 03:34:33.952]  Super Blue Toothpaste, 60% off.

[03:34:37.334 --> 03:34:40.016]  Plus, get free shipping!
[03:34:41.187 --> 03:34:45.591]  And double patriot points and a free shirt with every order.
[03:34:45.971 --> 03:34:55.398]  So do what you can to keep the truth alive as the corporations and the banksters try to shut us down and close us out with censorship.
[03:34:56.259 --> 03:35:00.542]  And by the way, here we got it right here.
[03:35:01.023 --> 03:35:03.585]  Censorship 2019.
[03:35:04.446 --> 03:35:08.429]  Governments across the globe, regardless of what political doctrine they profess,
[03:35:09.500 --> 03:35:16.784]  Inclusion with social media giants will accelerate the censorship 2019 trend.
[03:35:18.004 --> 03:35:27.509]  But opportunities exist to circumvent the government media monopolies by creating alternatives.
[03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.810]  You know what that is?
[03:35:29.690 --> 03:35:33.831]  That's one of our top mega trends for 2019.
[03:35:34.411 --> 03:35:34.912]  That's right.
[03:35:34.932 --> 03:35:43.254]  And they're going out this week to our subscribers, Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com, to read history before it happens.
[03:35:44.455 --> 03:35:51.877]  And we make a very good point in the censorship trend of how Alex Jones is the prime target.
[03:35:52.457 --> 03:35:58.699]  And when that happened, this trend that's been bubbling beneath the surface finally hit the news.
[03:35:59.542 --> 03:36:01.703]  Trends Journal, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:36:02.104 --> 03:36:05.606]  We're coming out with our top megatrends for 2019.
[03:36:06.046 --> 03:36:10.989]  And one of them is Economic 9-11.
[03:36:11.790 --> 03:36:16.533]  It's poised to strike and cause equity and market meltdowns worldwide.
[03:36:17.153 --> 03:36:21.736]  As many economies already in recession or headed for recession crash.
[03:36:22.656 --> 03:36:23.657]  Can it be stopped?
[03:36:27.339 --> 03:36:27.659]  U.S.
[03:36:27.759 --> 03:36:33.862]  credit markets dry up as rates rise and volatility rattles investors.
[03:36:34.462 --> 03:36:45.066]  From today's Financial Times, as everybody in the mainstream media all year long, we're talking about tariffs and trade wars.
[03:36:45.626 --> 03:36:56.310]  As you well know from me being on InfoWars, and all you people that subscribe to the Trends Journal, we've been saying, it's interest rates.
[03:36:57.077 --> 03:36:57.617]  Stupid?
[03:36:59.078 --> 03:37:00.159]  That's what it is.
[03:37:02.000 --> 03:37:03.361]  And that's all it's about.
[03:37:04.161 --> 03:37:05.542]  Cheap dough.
[03:37:06.462 --> 03:37:07.623]  And it's drying up.
[03:37:09.584 --> 03:37:09.844]  U.S.
[03:37:09.924 --> 03:37:25.133]  credit markets are grinding to a halt, with fund managers refusing to bankroll buyouts and investors shunning high-yield bond sales as rising interest rates and market volatility
[03:37:26.036 --> 03:37:27.157]  Way on sentiment.
[03:37:28.278 --> 03:37:37.144]  A prolonged period of low interest rates since the financial crisis, a decade ago, has seen companies binge on cheap money.
[03:37:37.824 --> 03:37:49.032]  However, as conditions have tightened, the high level of corporate leverage has raised widespread concern among regulators, analysts, and investors.
[03:37:49.732 --> 03:37:54.976]  I went forward, and this took out a lot of the other part of the story, just to make the point over here.
[03:37:56.084 --> 03:37:57.025]  Cheap debt.
[03:37:57.605 --> 03:37:58.566]  Cheap money.
[03:37:59.146 --> 03:38:00.867]  Isn't that something, huh?
[03:38:02.728 --> 03:38:15.475]  All these big cats got all that cheap dough to drive up the equity markets, of which 10% own over 90% of it on average, $350,000 worth of stock shares.
[03:38:16.776 --> 03:38:22.039]  And that other 10% owned by we, the little people, adds up to the grand total of about $15,000 per household.
[03:38:25.111 --> 03:38:26.312]  But check it out, man.
[03:38:27.913 --> 03:38:28.113]  What?
[03:38:28.613 --> 03:38:29.434]  I gotta be proper?
[03:38:30.574 --> 03:38:31.675]  Gotta say, we're man.
[03:38:31.695 --> 03:38:32.976]  I can't say, hey, man.
[03:38:33.376 --> 03:38:34.377]  Can't say that anymore.
[03:38:34.597 --> 03:38:35.617]  Me too won't like it.
[03:38:35.797 --> 03:38:36.078]  Yeah.
[03:38:36.878 --> 03:38:54.669]  Anyway, look at the interest rates that the banksters charge us with credit cards, with student loans, and they give the money for free.
[03:38:56.109 --> 03:38:57.794]  To the big fat cats!
[03:38:58.536 --> 03:38:58.937]  Yeah!
[03:38:59.398 --> 03:39:01.223]  Democracy, huh?
[03:39:01.804 --> 03:39:03.529]  What a sick joke!
[03:39:04.528 --> 03:39:05.769]  It's a takeover.
[03:39:06.109 --> 03:39:07.310]  Too big to fail?
[03:39:07.770 --> 03:39:10.012]  No such thing in capitalism.
[03:39:10.272 --> 03:39:16.836]  You rise and fall on your own merits, unless you're not a blank fine or a diamond.
[03:39:17.277 --> 03:39:22.280]  And not a diamond in the rough, the little boy diamond, the Jamie guy.
[03:39:22.300 --> 03:39:24.641]  Yeah, the JP Morgan Chase guy.
[03:39:25.302 --> 03:39:33.828]  One after another, the big banksters get all the dough for free, and they shaft it to us on those credit cards, don't they?
[03:39:34.904 --> 03:39:37.165]  Thank Jimmy Carter for that one.
[03:39:37.625 --> 03:39:54.332]  Oh, yeah, the peanut farmer with a peanut brain and cojones the size of peanuts who deregulated, began the deregulation of the banking industry to allow them to charge us these kind of rates.
[03:39:54.712 --> 03:39:57.994]  He also destroyed the airline industry.
[03:39:58.772 --> 03:40:04.995]  That used to be regulated as a public service, and I was a young guy flying first class back in the 70s.
[03:40:05.515 --> 03:40:06.996]  What a great trip it was.
[03:40:07.016 --> 03:40:09.277]  There were like 150 airlines.
[03:40:10.177 --> 03:40:13.679]  Great food, great service, and that's the way you built your business.
[03:40:13.719 --> 03:40:19.882]  You only could make so much on public transportation, but you could bring in more customers by better service.
[03:40:20.802 --> 03:40:28.006]  And that was the height of the airline industry until peanut brain, peanut cojones, cotta,
[03:40:29.315 --> 03:40:30.096]  Destroyed it.
[03:40:31.056 --> 03:40:34.299]  And another little clown that did it, Alfred Kahn.
[03:40:34.619 --> 03:40:37.302]  I remember what an arrogant boy he was, too.
[03:40:37.742 --> 03:40:46.149]  But he's dead now, I think, and better off dead, because he killed the airline industry to the joke that it is now.
[03:40:46.329 --> 03:40:57.038]  But moving on to the banksters and how the government, when they get paid off by the big corporations, shafted to the little people, this is the end
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:05.963]  of the phony Ponzi scheme pumped up by the banksters.
[03:41:06.663 --> 03:41:09.444]  They can't take real money.
[03:41:10.644 --> 03:41:11.265]  Here we go.
[03:41:12.165 --> 03:41:18.848]  Former Fed Chair Yellen yells excessive corporate debt could prolong a downturn.
[03:41:20.188 --> 03:41:21.969]  And what did I just say over here?
[03:41:22.829 --> 03:41:23.649]  Corporate debt.
[03:41:25.250 --> 03:41:27.411]  Not a single company has borrowed money
[03:41:29.446 --> 03:41:32.709]  Through the $1.2 trillion U.S.
[03:41:32.769 --> 03:41:35.071]  high-yield corporate bond market this month.
[03:41:36.672 --> 03:41:58.409]  If that drought persists, it could be the first month since November 2008, when global credit markets froze up after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, that not a single high-yield bond priced in the market, according to data provided by
[03:42:00.003 --> 03:42:01.584]  Informa and Dealogic.
[03:42:03.826 --> 03:42:05.927]  Yellin' warning, or yellin' yellin'.
[03:42:07.909 --> 03:42:23.759]  Chief financial officers at companies are pessimistic heading into 2019, with nearly half expecting a recession by the end of the year, according to a survey out last Wednesday by Duke University.
[03:42:24.100 --> 03:42:25.681]  Hey, but you know,
[03:42:26.403 --> 03:42:31.546]  Transjournal subscribers, we are in a Stage 1 recession.
[03:42:32.847 --> 03:42:34.428]  This is a real slowdown.
[03:42:35.188 --> 03:42:38.350]  The Dow is down over 500 points.
[03:42:41.132 --> 03:42:43.953]  Oil prices down 2-4%.
[03:42:44.754 --> 03:42:48.176]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:42:48.896 --> 03:42:51.598]  Prepare, prevail, and prosper.
[03:42:52.478 --> 03:42:53.119]  Be right back.
[03:42:55.074 --> 03:42:59.218]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:42:59.238 --> 03:43:01.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:43:02.810 --> 03:43:03.650]  Look, we all do it.
[03:43:04.250 --> 03:43:05.571]  A lot of times we don't have a choice.
[03:43:05.591 --> 03:43:13.413]  You go on a trip, you book into a big globalist hotel that funds groups trying to take our guns and teach our five-year-old boys how to wear dresses.
[03:43:13.853 --> 03:43:14.313]  It's a fact.
[03:43:14.333 --> 03:43:18.434]  These corporations are out to conquer humanity, not to break up our families.
[03:43:19.154 --> 03:43:22.695]  And sometimes I can't find an item at another online shop, I go to Amazon.
[03:43:23.335 --> 03:43:25.396]  But I consciously try to not do it.
[03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:35.457]  In fact, when I use a product, or I hear about folks that like a product, I tend to get the product and then sell it at a huge discount at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:36.278 --> 03:43:44.304]  There aren't many places where you can go where you're going to find items lower than Amazon, because they have created a total monopoly.
[03:43:44.564 --> 03:43:47.647]  They get like $1.48 on every shipment from the federal government.
[03:43:47.967 --> 03:43:48.628]  We don't do that.
[03:43:49.994 --> 03:43:54.076]  But we still bring you deals so good that in many cases it's better than Amazon.
[03:43:54.196 --> 03:44:01.219]  So you're funding the second American Revolution, you're sticking it in the eye of the globalists, and you're getting great products all at the same time.
[03:44:01.619 --> 03:44:03.740]  It's called a 360 win.
[03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:13.203]  I talk about that a lot, but you're not getting a 360 win when you go to Target or Walmart and buy a toy that breaks when you get it out of the box.
[03:44:14.064 --> 03:44:14.784]  And I'm not judging you.
[03:44:15.424 --> 03:44:16.505]  I was at the mall a week ago,
[03:44:18.677 --> 03:44:22.179]  19-month-old daughter saw this little robot car.
[03:44:23.139 --> 03:44:23.800]  She wanted it.
[03:44:24.420 --> 03:44:25.480]  I bought it from the woman.
[03:44:26.261 --> 03:44:29.122]  It was broken when I got home and didn't work.
[03:44:30.903 --> 03:44:38.347]  Well, we're not selling products like that, whether it's the water filtration, the air filtration, the supplements, the books, the videos, the patron apparel.
[03:44:38.467 --> 03:44:41.148]  It's all the very best at the lowest prices.
[03:44:41.208 --> 03:44:44.430]  So, we have the 12 Days of Christmas, the biggest sale in our history.
[03:44:45.373 --> 03:44:47.133]  We're selling on inventory ahead of the end of the year.
[03:44:47.914 --> 03:44:53.035]  Storewide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% is the lowest discount, up to 75%.
[03:44:53.655 --> 03:44:55.316]  We're losing money on a lot of these.
[03:44:55.736 --> 03:44:56.936]  So we have the 12 days of Christmas.
[03:44:57.216 --> 03:45:00.137]  One item every day was particularly discounted up to 75%.
[03:45:00.217 --> 03:45:08.840]  We're bringing all of those sales back up until the 19th, when you're still guaranteed to get delivered to continental United States before Christmas.
[03:45:10.480 --> 03:45:13.381]  Biggest sale in our history, extended, and now,
[03:45:14.684 --> 03:45:15.732]  All the super sales.
[03:45:16.567 --> 03:45:17.407]  That we're already there.
[03:45:17.427 --> 03:45:21.488]  The very best sales the last 12 days are all brought back right now.
[03:45:21.808 --> 03:45:25.909]  While not fighting traffic and not fighting all the stupid crowds at the big box stores.
[03:45:26.189 --> 03:45:29.430]  And not giving your money to Jeff Bezos that literally wants to gang rape this country.
[03:45:30.010 --> 03:45:34.871]  These specials were such massive lost leaders that we can only promote them for 24 hours.
[03:45:35.191 --> 03:45:40.552]  But now we're bringing back all of our M4's, Christmas Mega Specials, and M4Store.com for a limited time.
[03:45:40.852 --> 03:45:43.352]  And many are already completely selling out.
[03:45:43.973 --> 03:45:45.193]  So everything we had
[03:45:46.093 --> 03:45:49.996]  It's back on sale at the lowest price, except for items that have already sold out.
[03:45:50.216 --> 03:45:55.840]  Most products are still there, but a lot are going to be selling out, including best-selling t-shirts, so take advantage of this right now.
[03:45:56.601 --> 03:46:05.907]  I have made the decision to completely sell out our entire 2018 inventory at some of the lowest prices ever to avoid paying ridiculous amounts of government inventory tax.
[03:46:06.208 --> 03:46:12.012]  This is our last chance, and your last chance, to take advantage of these Christmas super specials, including Brain Force Plus,
[03:46:13.053 --> 03:46:16.975]  55% off and free shipping and a free t-shirt and double Patriot points.
[03:46:17.316 --> 03:46:21.299]  Bodies Ultimate Tumor Formula, 60% off and all the free shipping and free tertiary.
[03:46:21.659 --> 03:46:22.800]  I mean, there's too much to mention.
[03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:29.685]  The Bodies for 60% off and you get the free t-shirt and free shipping and double Patriot points.
[03:46:29.985 --> 03:46:35.009]  The Last Run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality, 55% off, free t-shirt, free shipping, double Patriot points.
[03:46:35.489 --> 03:46:37.031]  Ultimate Bone Broth, same deal.
[03:46:38.471 --> 03:46:41.933]  55% off, free shipping, double patriot points, free t-shirt, on and on.
[03:46:42.353 --> 03:46:44.874]  Super blue toothpaste and a whole family of products.
[03:46:45.574 --> 03:46:47.835]  Fluoride free, coiled silver iodine fortified.
[03:46:47.855 --> 03:46:52.476]  60% off and double patriot points and free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[03:46:52.816 --> 03:46:54.117]  Alpha power, it goes on and on.
[03:46:54.417 --> 03:46:55.177]  Biggest sale ever.
[03:46:55.217 --> 03:46:56.018]  Be part of history.
[03:46:56.238 --> 03:46:57.138]  Get great products.
[03:46:57.278 --> 03:46:58.178]  Win-win for everybody.
[03:46:58.478 --> 03:46:59.919]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:47:06.218 --> 03:47:08.940]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.854 --> 03:47:27.737]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.277 --> 03:47:31.921]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:35.481 --> 03:47:36.521]  Hey, everyone.
[03:47:37.261 --> 03:47:37.661]  Thank you.
[03:47:37.701 --> 03:47:39.042]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[03:47:39.102 --> 03:47:50.984]  Thank you for all the people at InfoWars for having me on and for all that you do to keep freedom of speech alive.
[03:47:51.284 --> 03:47:54.064]  It's dying fast in a country near you.
[03:47:54.084 --> 03:47:57.705]  And again, one of our top trends for 2019 is censorship. 2019.
[03:48:05.071 --> 03:48:08.892]  And the censorship of Alex Jones would finally brought it to the surface.
[03:48:09.013 --> 03:48:10.993]  And this is going on around the world.
[03:48:11.013 --> 03:48:30.381]  You know, I mentioned how we were sold out with the World Trade Organization when Bill Clinton, Slick Willie Clinton to be proper, brought us, brought China into the World Trade Organization and then officially under George W. Bush two weeks after 9-11.
[03:48:31.601 --> 03:48:33.562]  And how things were very different back then.
[03:48:34.983 --> 03:48:42.129]  When we could earn a living in the manufacturing sector.
[03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:46.753]  And all that is done to bring down the economy.
[03:48:49.355 --> 03:48:54.539]  So again, it's not tariffs or trade wars that are slowing this down.
[03:48:56.581 --> 03:49:00.685]  Just to repeat, all of Trump's tariffs on China account for only 0.7%.
[03:49:03.405 --> 03:49:17.407]  The Chinese GDP, while they have a $375 billion dollar merchandise trade deficit, or surplus, I should say, with the United States.
[03:49:17.487 --> 03:49:18.488]  We got the deficit.
[03:49:19.488 --> 03:49:25.429]  So again, when slowing down the global economy is higher interest rates.
[03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:29.250]  And there's a real shot that they may not happen.
[03:49:30.150 --> 03:49:32.010]  They may not raise them in December.
[03:49:33.834 --> 03:49:34.875]  This coming week.
[03:49:35.995 --> 03:49:42.859]  And if they do, the odds are they'll hold back next year.
[03:49:43.939 --> 03:49:47.261]  Because the world, again, can't take real money.
[03:49:48.321 --> 03:49:54.404]  They need that monetary meth with that $250 trillion debt load.
[03:49:57.746 --> 03:50:03.249]  And, again, this is Christmas time, so start doing your Christmas shopping.
[03:50:04.034 --> 03:50:05.895]  At InfoWars today.
[03:50:06.756 --> 03:50:07.016]  Yep.
[03:50:08.136 --> 03:50:16.781]  Buy what you can, do what you can, support InfoWars to keep freedom alive, freedom of speech that they're robbing from us.
[03:50:16.861 --> 03:50:22.764]  So I mentioned about China and how we became this trading partner with China.
[03:50:23.265 --> 03:50:33.130]  Not only that, talking about freedom of speech, Americans have taken the Chinese way of censorship.
[03:50:33.735 --> 03:50:43.799]  So not only are they making our products for us, over 96% of all our clothing and shoes are made in foreign countries, particularly China.
[03:50:44.279 --> 03:50:48.961]  So now we're mimicking their government censorship over the people.
[03:50:49.041 --> 03:50:59.846]  So China's taken over, not only in manufacturing, but in our democracy, where freedom of speech is shut down.
[03:51:02.296 --> 03:51:10.542]  Anyhow, I was talking about when you read the headlines and look at the news and you measure sentiment, it's very important.
[03:51:11.523 --> 03:51:14.105]  Fewer businesses see upturn in coming year.
[03:51:14.165 --> 03:51:20.249]  Businesses in the United States are less optimistic about the outlook for the coming year than they were 12 months ago.
[03:51:23.111 --> 03:51:23.431]  U.S.
[03:51:23.471 --> 03:51:27.214]  homebuilders stock under pressure as interest rates bite.
[03:51:28.435 --> 03:51:28.595]  Yep.
[03:51:29.667 --> 03:51:32.349]  The higher the interest rates, the lower their stocks.
[03:51:32.849 --> 03:51:35.611]  They're not only in bear territory, which is down 20%.
[03:51:35.711 --> 03:51:42.055]  These home builder stocks are down over 30% on average.
[03:51:42.635 --> 03:51:45.057]  Because you look at the reality of what's going on.
[03:51:46.738 --> 03:51:51.921]  Las Vegas housing weakness signals the slowdown is spreading.
[03:51:51.941 --> 03:51:55.744]  Inventory of unsold homes
[03:51:56.477 --> 03:52:01.759]  And the Las Vegas region has roughly doubled compared with a year earlier.
[03:52:03.420 --> 03:52:08.462]  Existing home sales slowed nearly 12% in November.
[03:52:12.444 --> 03:52:18.367]  The share of Las Vegas area listings with price cuts rose sharply to 23% in October.
[03:52:18.387 --> 03:52:20.207]  So, there you got it.
[03:52:26.735 --> 03:52:27.596]  These are real numbers.
[03:52:27.656 --> 03:52:31.418]  By the way, out in California, same thing's happening over there.
[03:52:31.438 --> 03:52:34.520]  It's a slowdown.
[03:52:34.600 --> 03:52:38.482]  And we're only talking about mortgage rates of 5%, 30-year mortgage.
[03:52:38.522 --> 03:52:40.003]  Around that, it's gone down a little bit.
[03:52:41.163 --> 03:52:42.004]  Can't sustain it.
[03:52:42.964 --> 03:52:44.285]  We need a cheap money fix.
[03:52:45.206 --> 03:52:48.307]  You know, one of the stories, I just want to divert for a second.
[03:52:51.229 --> 03:52:54.271]  You know, the Texas judge ruled against Obamacare.
[03:52:56.701 --> 03:52:59.002]  You know, and all the liberals love Obamacare.
[03:53:00.003 --> 03:53:04.445]  I mentioned earlier that in capitalism, there's no such thing as too big to fail.
[03:53:05.225 --> 03:53:10.428]  It's called the merger of state and corporate powers that Mussolini called fascism.
[03:53:11.588 --> 03:53:13.809]  And that's what Obamacare is.
[03:53:15.090 --> 03:53:17.531]  Fascist Obamacare.
[03:53:18.291 --> 03:53:25.815]  Because we, the little people, are forced to buy our insurance from private
[03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:29.231]  Health insurance companies.
[03:53:32.173 --> 03:53:39.637]  I don't have the latest numbers now, but before I went on the air, I just looked quickly to see what the story was.
[03:53:39.657 --> 03:53:42.319]  And this is from 2017.
[03:53:43.019 --> 03:53:50.223]  As Obamacare twists in political winds, top insurers made $6 billion.
[03:53:50.623 --> 03:53:54.786]  All top six insurers are seeing their stocks
[03:53:55.347 --> 03:53:57.469]  At all-time highs this summer.
[03:53:58.549 --> 03:53:59.290]  That was the summer of 2017.
[03:53:59.330 --> 03:54:08.136]  Their stocks have gone way, way up because we were forced to buy healthcare.
[03:54:08.656 --> 03:54:13.299]  By the way, you know the motto of the Trends Journal, and again, TrendsJournal.com.
[03:54:13.680 --> 03:54:16.702]  We're coming out with our top trends going out this week.
[03:54:17.142 --> 03:54:19.604]  Our subscribers, history before it happens.
[03:54:19.624 --> 03:54:22.626]  2019, the worst is yet to come.
[03:54:26.129 --> 03:54:26.829]  Be prepared.
[03:54:27.350 --> 03:54:34.554]  But anyway, going back to Obamacare and fascism, that's all this country's turned into.
[03:54:35.875 --> 03:54:37.676]  The corporations have taken over.
[03:54:39.718 --> 03:54:45.001]  As I was saying, I'm in favor of a good national health care program.
[03:54:45.541 --> 03:54:51.485]  Because the taxes that I've been paying all my life, what do I get back for it?
[03:54:51.805 --> 03:54:52.866]  That's what I get.
[03:54:54.153 --> 03:55:04.280]  Particularly here in Kingston, with the little mayor that we got here, with the dirty, filthy streets, cuts down trees, we get nothing other than garbage from them.
[03:55:04.300 --> 03:55:08.883]  So I'm in favor of some kind of healthcare program.
[03:55:12.265 --> 03:55:12.545]  Yeah.
[03:55:13.226 --> 03:55:17.108]  The more you pay, the more you should get back for the average person.
[03:55:17.429 --> 03:55:18.009]  And what do we get?
[03:55:18.029 --> 03:55:18.730]  We get nothing.
[03:55:19.190 --> 03:55:22.452]  We're forced to buy from private corporations.
[03:55:23.513 --> 03:55:23.753]  Again,
[03:55:24.346 --> 03:55:27.968]  The merger of state and corporate powers, fascism.
[03:55:29.048 --> 03:55:34.431]  So in summing up, in closing up, the economy is the big one.
[03:55:36.251 --> 03:55:38.192]  And it's something to watch very closely.
[03:55:39.013 --> 03:55:39.773]  Pay attention.
[03:55:40.413 --> 03:55:50.158]  These riots going on in France with the yellow vests, in Brussels, one country after another.
[03:55:52.138 --> 03:55:53.259]  The people are fed up.
[03:55:55.657 --> 03:55:57.317]  Because they can't feed themselves.
[03:55:58.598 --> 03:56:00.478]  All the dough's gone to the top.
[03:56:01.398 --> 03:56:06.459]  The rich have gotten richer, and the fatter they are, the more they want.
[03:56:07.139 --> 03:56:23.723]  And they keep stealing our money, just like Governor Cuomo over here in New York gave the richest man in the world some $5 billion in tax breaks so he could set up his headquarters near Wall Street.
[03:56:25.071 --> 03:56:31.573]  Right across the East River in Long Island City.
[03:56:34.613 --> 03:56:37.814]  Then, of course, these aren't tax breaks, by the way.
[03:56:38.094 --> 03:56:41.075]  When you see it in your newspaper or whatever, they gave a tax break.
[03:56:41.555 --> 03:56:43.436]  We gotta make up the difference.
[03:56:44.136 --> 03:56:45.516]  It's not a tax break.
[03:56:45.816 --> 03:56:52.638]  It's stealing more of our money to give to the bigs as they rip off the poor.
[03:56:53.709 --> 03:56:55.130]  And we, the working people.
[03:56:57.872 --> 03:57:07.699]  So, as I'm ready to sign off, I want to wish everybody a very Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season.
[03:57:08.600 --> 03:57:14.384]  And remember, start doing your Christmas shopping at InfoWars today.
[03:57:14.404 --> 03:57:19.527]  And the Trends Journal's top trends for 2019 will be out shortly.
[03:57:20.248 --> 03:57:21.128]  TrendsJournal.com.
[03:57:22.395 --> 03:57:25.238]  And again, put your money where your heart is.
[03:57:25.258 --> 03:57:28.802]  They have these great Christmas specials at InfoWars.
[03:57:30.423 --> 03:57:35.108]  You're not going to get these opportunities very long, so do what you can to support them.
[03:57:35.909 --> 03:57:39.372]  Have a happy and safe and joyous holiday.
[03:57:39.412 --> 03:57:39.953]  See you soon.
[03:57:55.979 --> 03:58:04.726]  I've been on air 23 plus years and I've learned a lot about sales because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution Bill of Rights and our way of life.
[03:58:05.487 --> 03:58:10.071]  I was never classically trained but over the last 23 years I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[03:58:10.752 --> 03:58:16.056]  Now there's lots of philosophies about have something really really expensive and a certain percentage will buy it believing it's the best.
[03:58:16.837 --> 03:58:17.758]  That's not what I do.
[03:58:18.578 --> 03:58:21.101]  I try to find the very best products that are popular
[03:58:21.981 --> 03:58:24.822]  Get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[03:58:24.902 --> 03:58:26.082]  That seems to be like common sense.
[03:58:26.202 --> 03:58:34.325]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[03:58:34.505 --> 03:58:41.787]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, water filtration, gravity-fed systems, because they're the very best.
[03:58:41.907 --> 03:58:44.507]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price.
[03:58:44.647 --> 03:58:46.548]  And so, we are the biggest distributor.
[03:58:46.728 --> 03:58:49.769]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[03:58:50.509 --> 03:58:51.051]  We're good to go.
