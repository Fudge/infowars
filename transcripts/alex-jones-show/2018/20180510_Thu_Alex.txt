[00:00:18.032 --> 00:00:24.078]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:34.388]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:35.269]  Just keep it coming!
[00:00:37.302 --> 00:00:39.663]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:40.863]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:42.664]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:46.806]  And then Owen Schroer and Roger Stone will kick off the always informative War Room.
[00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:50.147]  David Knight just completed his Real News Transmission, 8 a.m.
[00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:50.787]  to 11 a.m.
[00:00:50.827 --> 00:00:51.527]  Central every day.
[00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:56.229]  Iran and Israel are in a state of war.
[00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:01.131]  When you're firing missiles at each other and bombing each other and killing each other, you're at war.
[00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:09.181]  And the Supreme Dictator over in Iran said that Trump will be worm food and will soon die.
[00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:22.046]  And of course we're rolling footage of 22 rockets firing into Israel from the Golan Heights.
[00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:30.609]  Coming up in 15 minutes, Laura Loomer is joining us from the Golan Heights.
[00:01:31.937 --> 00:01:34.938]  Probably should have told the producers that when I came in this morning.
[00:01:35.339 --> 00:01:36.319]  She's in Israel.
[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.541]  So we have some of the reports that she sent us and followed from there.
[00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:45.303]  She's in basically the exact spot where those rockets came in yesterday.
[00:01:45.323 --> 00:01:47.124]  So we'll be talking to her.
[00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:52.787]  Israel responded by firing 60 rockets and overnight strikes on Syria.
[00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:58.290]  Russia's Ministry of Defense said 28 Israeli F-15 and F-16 planes were involved in the attack.
[00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:00.971]  And of course that comes
[00:02:04.269 --> 00:02:12.175]  Right after Israel, the night before, bombed the airbase south of Damascus.
[00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:14.676]  So, this is what you call a war.
[00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:17.599]  And it's escalating daily.
[00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.203]  Now, MSM is blaming Trump for this.
[00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:27.385]  For pulling out of the Iran deal.
[00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.667]  The Iran deal was a fraud.
[00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:31.989]  That said,
[00:02:33.806 --> 00:02:38.109]  At the same time, Iran and Israel have been spoiling for a new war.
[00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:50.859]  Since the last two times, through Hezbollah, firing rockets into Israel, Israel has invaded now Islamic-held, formerly Christian, Lebanon.
[00:02:52.961 --> 00:03:03.469]  And the Quds forces and the Hezbollah militia have defeated the high-tech Israeli tanks.
[00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:08.175]  And so they've just been spoiling to get into a giant war with each other.
[00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:11.595]  And forget taking sides here.
[00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:12.996]  This is going on.
[00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:20.397]  But when Obama first got into office for four or five years, this was also going on.
[00:03:20.437 --> 00:03:21.637]  So I think it's fair to blame Trump.
[00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:24.138]  But we're going to be looking at every angle of that.
[00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:34.060]  And who really helped escalate the crisis in the Middle East was John McCain, Obama, Hillary, and their whole false Arab spring, putting radical jihadis in charge.
[00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:49.330]  Again though, that said, the other big issue is the hostages coming back from North Korea after Pompeo went over and got them, the new Secretary of State, the newly minted Secretary of State.
[00:03:49.990 --> 00:04:01.032]  They're now saying that, Reuters is saying, the word is, it hasn't been officially announced, but within days, Trump will announce that Singapore is the site of this big meeting to officially end the Korean War.
[00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:02.813]  This is really, really positive news.
[00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:11.576]  They would have given Obama 5,000 Nobel Peace Prizes for this, instead he was given a Peace Prize, then launched seven different wars.
[00:04:13.457 --> 00:04:15.658]  And now we've got a new lie from McCain.
[00:04:15.678 --> 00:04:16.979]  See, I have something called a memory.
[00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:31.765]  So I got up this morning and I saw the headline that in McCain's new book, the New York Times has the exclusive, that John McCain says that he gave the dossier to the FBI, who then promptly gave it to the media.
[00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:33.759]  The fake dossier.
[00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:35.920]  But we know it goes back further than that.
[00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.502]  The FBI was financing the dossier.
[00:04:40.063 --> 00:04:42.004]  So, it's a circle of intrigue.
[00:04:42.304 --> 00:04:46.787]  But I remembered McCain saying last year and this year that he never did that.
[00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:50.990]  In fact, I pulled the articles up where he denied being involved in the dossier.
[00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.776]  He is just a congenital, Heating 5, globalist, Al-Qaeda, ISIS-supporting, total, maximum, globalist traitor.
[00:05:00.136 --> 00:05:01.757]  He is an absolute enemy of this country.
[00:05:03.231 --> 00:05:12.239]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:20.426]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:25.411]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:32.317]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:32.377 --> 00:05:39.464]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:05:39.564 --> 00:05:46.430]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.934]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:05:51.054 --> 00:05:54.317]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:05:54.458 --> 00:06:00.584]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:06:00.764 --> 00:06:02.425]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.224]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:12.824 --> 00:06:14.626]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:18.710]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.593]  Run on for a long time.
[00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:24.396]  Run on for a long time.
[00:06:25.097 --> 00:06:27.539]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.482]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:06:32.654 --> 00:06:41.064]  Speaking of liars that God is going to cut down, John McCain for the first year denied involvement.
[00:06:53.595 --> 00:07:04.940]  With the fake dossier that was just a collection of made-up lies and taxpayer money paid by the FBI and Justice Department to their wives and husbands at Fusion GPS to produce the piece of fiction.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.422]  And it came out last week that they're still paying Fusion GPS.
[00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:12.063]  Now it's a total of $50 million.
[00:07:12.403 --> 00:07:18.926]  And of course, John McCain came out and said he would do it again.
[00:07:20.452 --> 00:07:26.937]  That's Fox News saying it was his duty to release the dossier to the FBI.
[00:07:27.657 --> 00:07:33.782]  But I remember Comey in the news a year ago, right when he got fired, remember?
[00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:36.764]  Saying, no, no, McCain didn't give us the dossier.
[00:07:38.345 --> 00:07:42.188]  But again, they play games because there's been a bunch of dossiers.
[00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.682]  Just look, there's been a bunch of Star Trek movies.
[00:07:46.022 --> 00:07:46.582]  They're fiction.
[00:07:47.123 --> 00:07:48.644]  There's been a lot of Star Wars movies.
[00:07:49.204 --> 00:07:50.825]  There's been a lot of Winnie the Pooh movies.
[00:07:51.566 --> 00:07:53.768]  There's been a lot of Gunsmoke TV episodes.
[00:07:53.808 --> 00:07:55.049]  They're not real.
[00:07:58.031 --> 00:07:59.112]  So they play this game.
[00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:04.696]  Now that said, we've got the big news of the tit-for-tat beginning.
[00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:07.098]  Trump, two days ago, gives a speech.
[00:08:07.538 --> 00:08:09.720]  Says we're pulling out of the Iran deal that is a bad deal.
[00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:20.171]  And I understand why the president's doing it, to negotiate a better deal like he's done in North Korea, which so far I'm tacitly applauding and think's really a great thing.
[00:08:21.511 --> 00:08:33.954]  Not that I trust Kim Jong-un as far as anybody can throw him and his porcine, corpulent circumference.
[00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:39.415]  But that said now, Trump makes that announcement.
[00:08:40.555 --> 00:08:55.067]  Israel a couple hours later blows up an Iranian airbase, killing at least nine Iranians that came into the country to fight the ISIS-Al Qaeda forces that Hillary and Obama and Saudi Arabia put into the country.
[00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:57.029]  That's an incontrovertible fact.
[00:08:57.469 --> 00:08:59.170]  So Iran's not the bad guy there.
[00:08:59.411 --> 00:09:00.792]  They're the bad guy grabbing our ships.
[00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:05.525]  They're the bad guys saying your president will be dead in worm food yesterday.
[00:09:05.585 --> 00:09:07.927]  They're the bad guys threatening to blow Israel up routinely.
[00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:12.271]  They're the bad guys funding missiles being brought in in Lebanon to Israel's border.
[00:09:14.373 --> 00:09:15.994]  Iran doesn't take any Palestinians.
[00:09:16.334 --> 00:09:17.916]  Saudi Arabia doesn't take any Palestinians.
[00:09:18.777 --> 00:09:19.737]  They're total hypocrites.
[00:09:19.877 --> 00:09:22.580]  And Iran is an Islamic dictatorship.
[00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:25.983]  Yeah, they have elections, but the Ayatollah
[00:09:28.254 --> 00:09:29.656]  It's a genetic dictatorship.
[00:09:29.676 --> 00:09:31.257]  They're all, quote, related to Muhammad.
[00:09:31.418 --> 00:09:32.339]  That's what the Shiites are.
[00:09:32.359 --> 00:09:34.281]  You've got to be related to Muhammad to even be a teacher.
[00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:36.183]  That's why these guys all look like clones.
[00:09:38.685 --> 00:09:39.887]  They're 19% of Islam.
[00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:42.610]  And it is a Shiite Islamic state.
[00:09:43.691 --> 00:09:46.253]  And so they're chanting death to America and all the rest of this.
[00:09:46.273 --> 00:09:50.258]  You know, they have elections, but the Ayatollahs decide out of four or five people who can run.
[00:09:52.233 --> 00:09:54.374]  So it's like the Communist Party in China.
[00:09:55.074 --> 00:10:04.578]  The Central Committee, the Politburo, they decide a couple hundred people who are permanent communists, and the communists pass power back down to them.
[00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:11.721]  They decide who then can be a president.
[00:10:15.063 --> 00:10:17.704]  That's not a real republic.
[00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.387]  That's not a democracy either.
[00:10:20.467 --> 00:10:29.511]  What it is, is a political group, an oligarchy is the best term for it, that has a dictatorship.
[00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:46.098]  So, moronic video of the national television, state-run media in Iran, burning American flags, and just basically engaging in very, very, very primitive,
[00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.496]  Simeon-like, monkey-like behavior.
[00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:54.898]  But don't think we don't behave like that as well when a war starts.
[00:10:56.278 --> 00:11:05.842]  And you know, I made a point last night in a special report, and I saw a lot of commenters, not the majority, but a large portion, saying, oh Alex, you're full of prunes.
[00:11:05.902 --> 00:11:10.924]  The president doesn't control the media, they're his enemies.
[00:11:12.765 --> 00:11:16.486]  The president in time of war has no control over anything.
[00:11:17.912 --> 00:11:38.152]  And so I got in this morning and got to looking at all the news and I forgot to pull it, but anybody can, and I guess the crew can do it, each president reissues it since about Kennedy's time, that during a civil emergency, during a financial emergency, during an economic emergency, during a military emergency, all the major national media
[00:11:39.406 --> 00:11:46.731]  Starts reading from a script that's issued by the President and by the Continuity of Government boards that have been set up.
[00:11:46.751 --> 00:11:49.413]  You've also heard the emergency alert system that breaks in.
[00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:54.816]  There's also central systems that can fully take over every major transmission, including the Internet.
[00:11:56.478 --> 00:11:59.319]  They didn't have that power until Obama completed it in about 2011.
[00:12:03.493 --> 00:12:20.557]  The headlines were Obama's kill switch, internet kill switch, now in place, where they can forcibly redirect the entire internet, every website, every phone, every screen, just like you get amber alerts that break in on your phone, or hurricane alerts, or tornado alerts, or earthquake alerts.
[00:12:21.057 --> 00:12:32.180]  It can take over your phone, take over your computer, take over the AM radio station, take over the broadcast TV station, take over everything, and serve you local messages,
[00:12:34.073 --> 00:12:34.994]  Regional messages?
[00:12:36.514 --> 00:12:37.755]  Yes, yes, in 2011.
[00:12:38.335 --> 00:12:43.198]  Killswitch, Obama administration fears Egypt-style revolt in U.S.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:52.543]  It's a Paul Joseph Watson article and it links to Fox News covering it.
[00:12:55.305 --> 00:12:58.827]  We first told you about the Killswitch years before they were trying to put it in.
[00:12:59.167 --> 00:12:59.587]  But by 2011, it was in.
[00:13:03.237 --> 00:13:12.881]  To take full total control over the internet and everything connected to it.
[00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:15.923]  That's what the smart meters are about and the smart appliances.
[00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:19.444]  It's not just your local radio station or TV station or cable station.
[00:13:20.005 --> 00:13:21.385]  It's now your appliances.
[00:13:21.445 --> 00:13:23.186]  It's now your in-home cameras.
[00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:24.807]  It's now your smartphone.
[00:13:27.228 --> 00:13:30.909]  And so I talked about the fact that Trump made the announcement we're pulling out of the deal.
[00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:31.650]  I said, well,
[00:13:32.765 --> 00:13:35.947]  I'm tacitly, you know, giving him benefit of the doubt.
[00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:37.568]  I don't like it, but we'll see.
[00:13:37.869 --> 00:13:38.949]  He's been right about everything else.
[00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.211]  We know the globalists don't like him.
[00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:42.812]  We know the country's coming back.
[00:13:42.872 --> 00:13:45.654]  We know he brought Korea to the table.
[00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:52.939]  So I said, I'll give him tacit green light in my own personal support.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.301]  But I said, what if Israel kicks off something?
[00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:56.682]  Or what if Iran kicks off something?
[00:13:56.962 --> 00:14:00.625]  And our media started saying, the state-run media, that's what CNN is.
[00:14:00.785 --> 00:14:02.166]  Trump hasn't gotten full control of it yet.
[00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:06.013]  Sort of saying, oh my God, Israel's going to be attacked by Iran any minute.
[00:14:06.173 --> 00:14:10.036]  And then it was Israel attacked Iranian base in Syria hours later.
[00:14:11.818 --> 00:14:17.342]  And then Iran fired missiles back in, into the Golan Heights, out of Lebanon and Syria.
[00:14:17.362 --> 00:14:29.531]  And now that's kicked off, and now Israel bombs back, and now Laura Loomer's coming up in the next segment from the ground in the Golan Heights where the rockets came down last night, the intrepid reporter Laura Loomer.
[00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:30.712]  So she's coming up.
[00:14:32.102 --> 00:14:33.823]  And her videos are up on her site.
[00:14:33.843 --> 00:14:35.703]  They're also up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:14:35.723 --> 00:14:36.663]  We'll play some of those.
[00:14:37.464 --> 00:14:40.965]  But that's how this thing unravels and gets out of control so quickly.
[00:14:41.885 --> 00:14:49.848]  We'll also get into the clip with Trump praising the good side of Kim Jong-un, releasing these American hostages.
[00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:50.948]  That's certainly good news.
[00:14:51.868 --> 00:14:56.710]  We have so much to cover today that we'll be breaking down.
[00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:03.351]  Pat Drudge also warns Trump is opening up a Pandora's box of censorship with crusade on fake news because that can be spun back.
[00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:04.411]  Absolutely.
[00:15:05.072 --> 00:15:06.212]  There's another report here.
[00:15:06.392 --> 00:15:14.334]  England is set to pass rules where you get six months in prison for criticizing homosexuality or Islam or anything else.
[00:15:14.814 --> 00:15:22.475]  So that's the total authoritarianism already in Germany and Sweden now coming to the UK and then of course to the US and the colleges.
[00:15:22.735 --> 00:15:24.676]  Over 200 colleges have set up these boards.
[00:15:25.563 --> 00:15:31.767]  Where if someone just has a gesture, or you think they don't like you, if they're white, they get in trouble.
[00:15:32.427 --> 00:15:45.615]  That's like that Beavis and Butthead, they had a new season, after 20 years of not having it, and I just saw it the other night, it just happened to be surfing television, and Beavis and Butthead think a girl is sexually harassing them telepathically, and they get before the judge,
[00:15:46.696 --> 00:15:48.277]  She's gonna throw the girl, you know, in jail.
[00:15:48.838 --> 00:15:50.960]  But then they say the judge is raping them as well.
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.762]  And actually, an EEOC complaint against me.
[00:15:53.802 --> 00:15:56.224]  It says I never said anything sexual, but they thought it.
[00:15:56.304 --> 00:15:57.205]  It was telepathic.
[00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:00.408]  So that's the new thing, is telepathic rape.
[00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:04.771]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:06.533]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:09.776]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:21.909]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:31.432]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[00:16:31.952 --> 00:16:37.514]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.

[00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.137]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:45.957]  Buy these!
[00:16:46.577 --> 00:16:47.458]  Sold out in a month!
[00:16:48.728 --> 00:16:51.549]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:53.150]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:56.331]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[00:16:57.071 --> 00:16:59.032]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[00:16:59.612 --> 00:17:00.392]  Get yours today.
[00:17:00.713 --> 00:17:01.913]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:17:02.033 --> 00:17:05.234]  Infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:17:05.674 --> 00:17:06.915]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:08.095]  We're good to go!
[00:17:25.145 --> 00:17:28.609]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:34.876]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:17:34.896 --> 00:17:39.722]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:42.564]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:17:42.884 --> 00:17:44.245]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:17:44.645 --> 00:17:54.251]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:17:54.351 --> 00:17:56.512]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:17:57.033 --> 00:18:01.916]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:03.557]  We're gonna continue to stand up
[00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:10.201]  Before America, we are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:18:10.881 --> 00:18:13.803]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:18:14.243 --> 00:18:17.765]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:18:18.386 --> 00:18:29.653]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:18:30.273 --> 00:18:41.036]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:18:41.336 --> 00:18:46.778]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[00:18:47.098 --> 00:18:50.359]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.

[00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.002]  You're helping to fight for freedom.

[00:19:00.084 --> 00:19:01.705]  We need your support.
[00:19:02.205 --> 00:19:05.787]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:09.109]  But they've cut off the sponsors, they've blocked us advertising on Google.
[00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.791]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[00:19:11.831 --> 00:19:12.752]  We've beaten six.
[00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:15.013]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:16.434]  You're my soldier.
[00:19:16.454 --> 00:19:17.195]  We're all in this together.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.943]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[00:19:23.344 --> 00:19:24.344]  So I salute you and I thank you.

[00:19:51.708 --> 00:19:57.233]  The very best supplements, water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, emergency radios, tactical gear, body armor.
[00:19:57.634 --> 00:19:59.816]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:20:00.176 --> 00:20:01.378]  Please shop with the good guys.
[00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:17.523]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:18.003 --> 00:20:24.245]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:26.338 --> 00:20:33.384]  Well, independent investigative reporter Laura Loomer is in the Golan Heights, but she's getting to a more secure location before we talk to her via telephone.
[00:20:33.804 --> 00:20:38.448]  Here in just a moment, she filed a bunch of video reports that are on InfoWars.com right now and on her Twitter.
[00:20:39.008 --> 00:20:42.491]  But first, let's look at some of the successes of President Trump in the last year and a half.
[00:20:43.132 --> 00:20:45.874]  Do you deserve the Golan Prize, do you think?
[00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:47.976]  Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it.
[00:20:48.016 --> 00:20:49.537]  You know what I want to do?
[00:20:49.877 --> 00:20:51.799]  I want to get it finished.
[00:20:52.479 --> 00:20:54.641]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[00:20:58.746 --> 00:21:09.398]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[00:21:09.418 --> 00:21:10.719]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.381]  You're a white man!
[00:21:12.481 --> 00:21:16.966]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:18.969]  Move, bitch!
[00:21:18.989 --> 00:21:19.970]  Get out the way!
[00:21:27.998 --> 00:21:32.601]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:21:32.621 --> 00:21:35.783]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:21:35.803 --> 00:21:36.784]  I will not let you down.
[00:21:36.884 --> 00:21:39.286]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:21:39.426 --> 00:21:42.048]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:44.369]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:21:44.489 --> 00:21:49.713]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:21:49.753 --> 00:21:52.595]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:21:52.615 --> 00:21:53.356]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:21:56.854 --> 00:21:59.015]  But the corporate media told us he didn't want to be president.
[00:21:59.616 --> 00:22:01.337]  They told us he wouldn't run again for re-election.
[00:22:02.038 --> 00:22:04.499]  McCain told us he didn't give the dossier to the FBI.
[00:22:07.521 --> 00:22:10.343]  McCain denies being BuzzFeed's Trump dossier source.
[00:22:11.404 --> 00:22:13.686]  No, he just gave it to the FBI, then they gave it to him.
[00:22:14.806 --> 00:22:15.667]  He didn't do anything.
[00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.293]  Trying to bring Iran to the table like we're bringing North Korea to the table is a different trick, though.
[00:22:25.831 --> 00:22:30.433]  You've got Israel hitting that base, claiming they were aiming missiles at Israel.
[00:22:30.473 --> 00:22:32.794]  Well, they're firing missiles back.
[00:22:32.874 --> 00:22:33.815]  Israel's bombing them.
[00:22:35.175 --> 00:22:37.597]  It's a real mess, but that deal was a real mess.
[00:22:37.617 --> 00:22:42.819]  We're going to get Laura Loomer's take in Israel on this, in the Golan Heights, where the rockets were landing last night.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.501]  And where the air raid sirens were taking place.
[00:22:52.023 --> 00:22:55.425]  Because this is a war that has already
[00:22:57.349 --> 00:22:57.869]  Kicked off.
[00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:18.424]  This is conflict with the Iranian slash Saudi Arabian civil war that's happening inside Islam spilling over into Israel.
[00:23:21.606 --> 00:23:23.728]  And these are just the lighter weapons that are going in.
[00:23:23.768 --> 00:23:26.290]  Iran's got heavy missiles, thousands of them.
[00:23:27.901 --> 00:23:29.981]  So how soon until, oops, a ship gets sunk?
[00:23:30.722 --> 00:23:36.843]  How soon until the tit-for-tat escalates very, very quickly?
[00:23:36.883 --> 00:23:44.224]  Right now Israel is shooting down most of these incoming missiles that are medium-sized with its Iron Dome system.
[00:23:46.285 --> 00:23:49.085]  We'll be talking to Laura Loomer this segment and the next here in just a moment.
[00:23:49.426 --> 00:23:51.886]  First off, supporting this broadcast is critical.
[00:23:52.606 --> 00:23:56.247]  We have the Nazi collaborator George Soros through his different outlets.
[00:23:58.473 --> 00:23:59.855]  Funding lawsuits against us.
[00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:02.317]  We have Hillary Clinton trying to get us shut down.
[00:24:02.358 --> 00:24:05.281]  We have major publications calling for us to be shut down.
[00:24:07.383 --> 00:24:08.484]  But we will defeat them.
[00:24:08.685 --> 00:24:11.488]  We've already gotten nine of the 16 lawsuits thrown out.
[00:24:13.951 --> 00:24:17.254]  And if you'll simply buy great products at Infowarsstore.com that you and your family
[00:24:18.172 --> 00:24:19.352]  Absolutely need.
[00:24:20.193 --> 00:24:20.873]  It's a win-win.
[00:24:20.913 --> 00:24:22.493]  A non-zero-sum game.
[00:24:22.853 --> 00:24:23.714]  A 360 win.
[00:24:23.734 --> 00:24:31.576]  So I want you to try our incredibly popular fluoride-free colloidal silver iodine fortified adult and children's toothpaste.
[00:24:31.996 --> 00:24:36.237]  We have the mouthwash that's fortified as well, as well as the immune gargle in three different sizes.
[00:24:36.297 --> 00:24:37.478]  Boy, is that a powerful product.
[00:24:38.078 --> 00:24:40.199]  It's got so many other uses that we don't even put on there.
[00:24:40.219 --> 00:24:43.382]  You can go read the individual reviews, five-star, thousands of them.
[00:24:43.402 --> 00:24:47.084]  It's a new combo pack, so there's no reviews there if you're watching on TV.
[00:24:47.384 --> 00:24:49.425]  It has free shipping as well, not just 50% off.
[00:24:49.906 --> 00:24:52.888]  And also, the ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:24:53.965 --> 00:25:09.785]  Bodies 95% curcumin in level bidding competitors have a 3% it's just joke level they don't it's just a bunch of powdered crud this is concentrated curcumin and then five other super antioxidants and anti-inflammatories an example is my wife
[00:25:11.144 --> 00:25:20.591]  She was a big tennis player and a big exercise person, and since she had the baby, she stopped exercising as much, and her hips seized up, and she went to chiropractor, she went to massages, she went to everything.
[00:25:21.532 --> 00:25:26.415]  She was looking at having surgery, and then I just said, take a crap ton of bodies for two weeks.
[00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:33.941]  And she goes, well, almost all the pain's gone, but I think it's maybe that I stopped drinking, and she barely drinks anyways.
[00:25:35.042 --> 00:25:38.844]  And I think maybe it's I'm getting more sleep, and I'm like, it's the turmeric, sweetheart.
[00:25:39.685 --> 00:25:44.711]  But I'm telling the story as it happens, so I gotta start shoveling that down two weeks ago.
[00:25:45.272 --> 00:25:48.475]  And magically, one of the crew members here had gout.
[00:25:48.535 --> 00:25:49.636]  I said, take bodies, boom.
[00:25:50.814 --> 00:25:52.676]  He'd already been on medicine, wasn't helping him.
[00:25:52.736 --> 00:25:54.658]  And I'm not saying it's a replacement for medicine.
[00:25:55.198 --> 00:25:58.582]  I'm not saying, you know, that you gotta have air to live, or that you need vitamin C to live.
[00:25:59.122 --> 00:26:00.523]  The FDA says you're not supposed to say that.
[00:26:00.583 --> 00:26:05.348]  So, I cannot tell you you need air or water to live, or that you'll die without vitamin C, even though you will.
[00:26:06.049 --> 00:26:07.710]  Or that you'll die without iodine.
[00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.191]  It's a fact.
[00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:10.553]  Or that IQs are dropping because iodine deficiency.
[00:26:11.134 --> 00:26:11.955]  Who cares if it's a fact?
[00:26:11.995 --> 00:26:12.835]  Just, you know, die!
[00:26:12.875 --> 00:26:13.316]  Be stupid!
[00:26:14.437 --> 00:26:15.198]  I agree with the FDA.
[00:26:16.471 --> 00:26:18.252]  So, you do not need oxygen to live.
[00:26:18.413 --> 00:26:20.374]  Now, please don't strangle yourself or you'll die.
[00:26:20.474 --> 00:26:24.217]  But, again, these statements are not approved by the FDA.
[00:26:24.377 --> 00:26:28.300]  I want you to try Super Blue, 50% off all Super Blue products.
[00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:30.883]  I want you to try the Ultimate Turmeric Pharma, 50% off.
[00:26:31.943 --> 00:26:32.684]  Order today.
[00:26:33.585 --> 00:26:33.725]  Now...
[00:26:35.874 --> 00:26:40.196]  If you continue to fund us, if you continue to spread the articles and the videos and pray for us, we'll be here.
[00:26:40.596 --> 00:26:44.277]  If you don't stand with us, The Globalist will be successful and shut us down.
[00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:49.559]  But you're standing with us and I really want to thank you all, but please think about supporting InfoWars today.
[00:26:49.579 --> 00:26:56.041]  Now we're going to break in a few minutes, but I want Laura Loomer, who again has filed reports right up there in the Golan Heights from the mountaintops.
[00:26:56.821 --> 00:26:59.302]  She's now in a safer location in the Golan.
[00:27:01.483 --> 00:27:05.388]  She's again got her Twitter account we're going to put on screen for you if you want to follow that.
[00:27:05.828 --> 00:27:11.996]  But there she is yesterday and this morning at the Golan Heights at Laura Loomer is how you can follow her on Twitter.
[00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:16.801]  Laura, wow, I didn't know you were in Israel until I started seeing your reports getting filed in the middle of the night.
[00:27:16.841 --> 00:27:17.883]  So I hope you're being safe there.
[00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:20.816]  Yeah, I'm doing my best.
[00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:22.296]  It's been a wild night.
[00:27:22.616 --> 00:27:30.580]  I've been in Israel for about a week or so now and I'm going to be here probably for the rest of the month just reporting really on the embassy move.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:37.223]  But last night I was sleeping and around 3 in the morning I was woken up by the missile attack.
[00:27:37.263 --> 00:27:47.548]  The missile attack that was fired by Iranian forces out of Syria went right past my hotel on the Galilee.
[00:27:48.248 --> 00:27:48.829]  We're good to go.
[00:28:07.984 --> 00:28:08.624]  Look, here's the deal.
[00:28:08.644 --> 00:28:10.225]  Everybody knows I'm not anti-Israel.
[00:28:10.245 --> 00:28:11.005]  I like Israel.
[00:28:11.525 --> 00:28:13.446]  At the same time, I don't like the Iranian dictators.
[00:28:13.466 --> 00:28:14.326]  I like the Iranian people.
[00:28:14.366 --> 00:28:19.148]  But Trump makes this announcement, and then Israel bombs this military base.
[00:28:19.168 --> 00:28:19.668]  You're in Israel.
[00:28:19.688 --> 00:28:20.649]  Maybe you have inside baseball.
[00:28:20.669 --> 00:28:21.289]  Why they did that.
[00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:22.629]  And then now this tit-for-tat.
[00:28:22.649 --> 00:28:26.551]  I mean, I think there's a war really pretty much started between Israel and Iran right now.
[00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:27.391]  Is that a fair statement?
[00:28:28.772 --> 00:28:31.715]  Yeah, I mean, I've been saying for weeks now that I think that it's inevitable.
[00:28:31.775 --> 00:28:37.099]  I think there's going to be war between Israel and Iran, and I think that a lot of the, it's not just Israel, right?
[00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:49.610]  We've seen the behavior on behalf of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, I mean, coming out, just kind of out of nowhere, all of a sudden saying that Israel has a right to exist, which is something that no Muslim leader has ever said, right?
[00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.411]  I mean, that's totally...
[00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:52.110]  Stay there.
[00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.151]  Skype's breaking up a bit.
[00:28:53.171 --> 00:28:53.911]  We're coming right back.
[00:28:53.951 --> 00:28:56.392]  Yeah, I mean, war has already started between Iran and Israel.
[00:28:57.053 --> 00:28:58.513]  I mean, it's happened here.
[00:28:59.014 --> 00:29:00.394]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:00.434 --> 00:29:00.854]  Stay with us.
[00:29:01.795 --> 00:29:16.862]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:25.467]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[00:29:26.888 --> 00:29:29.411]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[00:29:30.212 --> 00:29:33.635]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[00:29:34.576 --> 00:29:36.758]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.605]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[00:29:45.563 --> 00:29:52.167]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[00:29:53.148 --> 00:29:54.149]  It's up to us personally.
[00:29:55.530 --> 00:30:02.374]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[00:30:02.894 --> 00:30:04.195]  I expected that to happen.
[00:30:05.376 --> 00:30:06.697]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:30:08.686 --> 00:30:19.612]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:21.854]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[00:30:22.554 --> 00:30:34.181]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[00:30:34.761 --> 00:30:36.963]  And we've already come so far together
[00:30:37.984 --> 00:30:46.991]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[00:30:47.571 --> 00:30:52.995]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[00:30:54.116 --> 00:31:02.002]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[00:31:04.235 --> 00:31:12.503]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[00:31:13.023 --> 00:31:14.465]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[00:31:15.466 --> 00:31:18.128]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[00:31:18.929 --> 00:31:20.751]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[00:31:20.791 --> 00:31:25.675]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[00:31:26.776 --> 00:31:37.549]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[00:31:37.609 --> 00:31:41.554]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[00:31:42.978 --> 00:31:43.618]  Our game changing.
[00:31:44.058 --> 00:31:45.539]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:46.899]  The other equation of probiotic.
[00:31:46.959 --> 00:31:50.520]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:51.941]  We've got the real red pill.
[00:31:52.021 --> 00:31:56.382]  It's got preglanone that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[00:31:56.922 --> 00:31:59.963]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[00:32:00.063 --> 00:32:01.283]  It just does incredible things.
[00:32:01.703 --> 00:32:03.144]  Look into the real red pill for yourself.
[00:32:03.564 --> 00:32:06.145]  Then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[00:32:06.185 --> 00:32:14.067]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste that's fortified with colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[00:32:14.688 --> 00:32:25.831]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.
[00:32:26.271 --> 00:32:31.273]  Silver, salt, nano silver, iodine, the ionized water, stevia, peppermint,
[00:32:31.673 --> 00:32:33.154]  Essential oil and so much more.
[00:32:33.194 --> 00:32:34.495]  It's great for the throat and the body.
[00:32:34.735 --> 00:32:35.896]  You can swallow it as well.
[00:32:36.277 --> 00:32:42.561]  So, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is also the latest product we've got at Infowarslife.com.
[00:32:42.901 --> 00:32:44.262]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:32:44.282 --> 00:32:53.889]  So, thank you all for remembering Infowarsstore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake and it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:57.252]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:33:05.825 --> 00:33:08.566]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.107 --> 00:33:18.948]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.309 --> 00:33:19.929]  Watch me!
[00:33:21.169 --> 00:33:21.809]  Watch me!
[00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:23.690]  I got it!
[00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.650]  Watch me!
[00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.491]  I got it!
[00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:28.711]  Hey!
[00:33:29.804 --> 00:33:31.065]  All right, Laura Lummer joins us.
[00:33:31.145 --> 00:33:39.333]  Her Skype failed, so she's joining us via the phone from the Golan Heights right there by the Galilee where the rockets came in last night.
[00:33:40.214 --> 00:33:41.896]  And here's my bottom line.
[00:33:42.176 --> 00:33:43.237]  The optics are bad.
[00:33:43.357 --> 00:33:45.099]  Trump says we're pulling out of the Iran deal.
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:51.345]  And then I see all over the news Israel bracing for Iranian attack and then Israel hits this
[00:33:53.095 --> 00:34:09.991]  Airbase that kills a bunch of Iranians and who knows who else just south of Damascus in Syria's capital and then they fire rockets back in and Israel attacks that and then we don't really hear from Israel much about why they did it other than there were missiles aimed at Israel there.
[00:34:10.592 --> 00:34:15.757]  Well by that extension they could attack in the main country of Iran and kick off the big war.
[00:34:16.886 --> 00:34:24.370]  So again, I want to get Laura's take on that, what the Israelis she's talking to, what the military she's seeing are saying, and what the inside scoop is.
[00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:37.717]  And then as she said, all the signs are there with the Crown Prince who's running Saudi Arabia, recognizing Israel, saying he's going to let Christian churches and Jewish mosques or Jewish synagogues be right next to mosques.
[00:34:38.217 --> 00:34:51.606]  Uh, and just all these statements, a major political realignment with Israel, the United States, and Saudi Arabia against Iran, and this whole situation in Syria, it just sounds like the beginning of potential World War III.
[00:34:51.646 --> 00:34:52.146]  Laura Loomer.
[00:34:53.908 --> 00:34:56.529]  Yeah, no, I agree with that, and I apologize for my site scaling.
[00:34:56.549 --> 00:34:58.491]  Hey, that's not your fault, that's the technology.
[00:34:59.994 --> 00:35:02.156]  Yeah, it's really hard to get service here, as you can imagine.
[00:35:02.796 --> 00:35:07.600]  But yeah, look, I think that this has been in the works for some time now.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:19.410]  I've been reporting for the past few months that I predict that there is going to be war with Iran, especially because of Saudi Arabia's very random, strange, and misplaced connection
[00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:20.670]  We're good to go.
[00:35:48.849 --> 00:35:49.229]  I think so.
[00:36:09.787 --> 00:36:10.848]  Pretty much.
[00:36:10.909 --> 00:36:13.532]  You got the vibe that he was really speaking to Trump, right?
[00:36:13.572 --> 00:36:22.123]  Speaking to America about how Obama lied about the Iran deal and Iran lied about the Iran deal because, as you know, Mossad agents went in.
[00:36:23.523 --> 00:36:34.231]  And they carried out this very covert operation and escaped with thousands of documents about the Iranian nuclear program.
[00:36:34.671 --> 00:36:35.912]  So I think it's inevitable.
[00:36:35.952 --> 00:36:37.153]  The tensions are rising.
[00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:40.335]  And I was on the Golan Heights today speaking with IDF soldiers.
[00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:43.677]  I was on the Lebanon border speaking with IDF soldiers as well.
[00:36:44.698 --> 00:36:47.299]  And they have been preparing for this for a while.
[00:36:48.842 --> 00:37:09.157]  And they think that things will be very hectic for the next week or two, but they're hoping that they will be under control, especially given the fact that today or last night, the IDF did take out most, or they're claiming at least most, of the Iranian military installations located in Syria.
[00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.111]  Now, this could easily escalate, though.
[00:37:13.151 --> 00:37:15.853]  I hope that it de-escalates and a new deal can be made that's better.
[00:37:15.873 --> 00:37:21.977]  Because, obviously, that was just a ceasefire a few years ago from the low-intensity conflict that was still going on.
[00:37:21.997 --> 00:37:31.403]  Of course, it's high-intensity if you get killed, but militarily it's seen as low-intensity conflict, firing rockets and bombing each other occasionally back and forth.
[00:37:32.184 --> 00:37:37.948]  But now with this major realignment and what's happening in Iran, talking about launching full-out war, attacking U.S.
[00:37:38.008 --> 00:37:39.949]  ships, if they attack a U.S.
[00:37:39.989 --> 00:37:41.290]  ship, Trump is going to hit
[00:37:42.191 --> 00:37:43.273]  Iran very, very hard.
[00:37:43.333 --> 00:37:50.563]  Iran says they're going to have a total commitment back and this could explode into a major league hot war within hours.
[00:37:52.082 --> 00:37:53.323]  Yeah, no, I completely agree.
[00:37:53.363 --> 00:37:56.307]  But it's not only just, you know, like, physical attacks.
[00:37:56.427 --> 00:38:11.543]  Iran said that they will—there was a report today I saw in the Daily Mail about how Iran may be carrying out cyberattacks against Western businesses to retaliate against Trump and the United States for withdrawing from the Iran deal, of course.
[00:38:11.983 --> 00:38:27.092]  So, I think that a cyber attack could be even more devastating, really, than a bombing, because I don't really feel like the United States is really prepared for a massive cyber attack on electrical grids and infrastructure, right?
[00:38:27.132 --> 00:38:40.881]  I mean, we're always talking about bombings and, you know, like, actual physical military attacks, but nobody really ever talks about how devastating a large-scale cyber attack could be.
[00:38:43.131 --> 00:38:44.832]  Well, this could go nuclear very quickly.
[00:38:44.892 --> 00:38:50.755]  My sources a decade ago told me that Iran had at least five nuclear weapons, atomic bombs, but they didn't have a delivery system.
[00:38:51.235 --> 00:38:58.459]  And then you notice that when Netanyahu gave those presentations, which Iran admits are real documents, they're just older, that they had a goal of five weapons.
[00:38:58.899 --> 00:39:05.804]  I mean, you look at all the castings and all the documents and videos, I mean, they've achieved atomic weapons is what I've been told.
[00:39:06.104 --> 00:39:13.990]  And the real concern, you kept seeing this from Netanyahu and from Trump, was the ICBMs, the fast delivery systems that can hit Europe as well already.
[00:39:14.631 --> 00:39:26.180]  So I think that's why Israel and others are so, and Saudi Arabia are so concerned, because I was told by very credible sources, and have been on record ten years ago, that Iran has five weapons.
[00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:32.935]  Yeah, no, and that's the discussion that's really taking place here in Israel as well.
[00:39:33.335 --> 00:39:46.125]  And it's also very concerning because, as you know, the embassy move is taking place in four days, and the aggression is not only now directed towards Israel, but it's also, you know, really directed towards Americans.
[00:39:46.205 --> 00:39:50.169]  And there's going to be a lot of Americans in Israel and the U.S.
[00:39:50.209 --> 00:39:56.554]  delegation, you know, many members from Trump's administration here this week for the official embassy move.
[00:39:57.074 --> 00:40:01.277]  And, you know, the 70th anniversary of, you know, Israel's independence.
[00:40:01.898 --> 00:40:19.731]  And so, you know, of course that gives the United States and Israel even more motive and more, you know, more concern when it comes to eliminating, you know, these Iranian military bases in Syria and really just making sure that they are denuclearized.
[00:40:20.626 --> 00:40:21.348]  Well, I know this.
[00:40:21.749 --> 00:40:29.767]  Six years ago, our own military told Obama no in backing Saudi Arabia and a different faction then that's been taken out, reportedly now, to
[00:40:31.716 --> 00:40:35.558]  Overturn Syria and give it to basically Wahhabist Al-Qaeda folks.
[00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:41.142]  And then Syria did agree, and then this came out later, we first broke it here from Colonel Schaefer and others.
[00:40:41.762 --> 00:40:48.186]  They did agree to then once ISIS and Al-Qaeda were kicked out, to hold elections and that Assad would leave.
[00:40:49.047 --> 00:40:54.590]  So I think a lot of the pressure now from Trump is the fact that we haven't been hearing that from Assad now.
[00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:57.452]  So I don't know if Assad is going to abide by that deal.
[00:40:57.552 --> 00:40:58.693]  Any word on that in Israel?
[00:41:01.073 --> 00:41:04.695]  I can't really speak to that, no.
[00:41:05.716 --> 00:41:08.197]  But, you know, I would agree with you on that.
[00:41:09.098 --> 00:41:13.701]  You know, I have the same feeling as you do, the same concern.
[00:41:13.881 --> 00:41:17.102]  But really, the focus right now
[00:41:18.564 --> 00:41:21.887]  You know, it's oddly calm.
[00:41:21.947 --> 00:41:29.372]  I mean, regardless of the fact that there were these attacks last night, Israel and the Israeli people and the IDF, they seem to be very calm.
[00:41:29.432 --> 00:41:32.995]  I mean, the people in the Golan Heights today, they sent their kids to school.
[00:41:33.275 --> 00:41:34.316]  People went to work.
[00:41:34.376 --> 00:41:35.417]  It was still open.
[00:41:35.437 --> 00:41:36.918]  It wasn't shut down.
[00:41:36.938 --> 00:41:38.779]  Sure, well, that's good news.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:48.969]  I'm just concerned this tit-for-tat back and forth or the ships there in the Persian Gulf is something that can trigger very very quickly because this is basically a state of war between Israel and Iran with the U.S.
[00:41:48.989 --> 00:41:49.890]  being sucked into it.
[00:41:49.930 --> 00:42:03.503]  I know this though, I've never in the three or four years I've been following your work I've never seen you cover anything from Israel so I guess you did predict this a few months ago I guess you traveled there because you want to be in the middle of this to report on it so you got a lot of courage being right there in the middle of it.
[00:42:04.875 --> 00:42:06.076]  Yeah, no, definitely.
[00:42:06.136 --> 00:42:07.897]  And you are right, this is a tit-for-tat.
[00:42:08.197 --> 00:42:22.106]  I mean, I was on the Lebanon border with Israel yesterday, and they did have Israeli gunships in the water patrolling, you know, because they have Iranian proxies, you know, Hezbollah, right across from Lebanon.
[00:42:22.407 --> 00:42:27.270]  And so this could get nuclear, and it could become very disastrous very quickly.
[00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:30.272]  And, you know, what may appear to be
[00:42:30.932 --> 00:42:33.674]  Uh, Tom, uh, you are correct.
[00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:06.374]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[00:43:06.434 --> 00:43:13.896]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[00:43:13.956 --> 00:43:19.778]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:26.179]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:27.940]  But he didn't give up.
[00:43:29.224 --> 00:43:29.684]  And he won.
[00:43:31.426 --> 00:43:32.827]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[00:43:33.607 --> 00:43:37.691]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[00:43:38.931 --> 00:43:42.174]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[00:43:43.275 --> 00:43:44.176]  And they all died.
[00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:45.777]  All 180 plus men.
[00:43:47.638 --> 00:43:51.141]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[00:43:52.742 --> 00:43:56.985]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[00:43:57.186 --> 00:43:58.807]  But I know this.
[00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:21.600]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[00:44:23.106 --> 00:44:26.809]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:29.932]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes.
[00:44:29.952 --> 00:44:35.277]  It's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[00:44:37.679 --> 00:44:47.187]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[00:44:49.574 --> 00:44:52.916]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[00:44:53.917 --> 00:44:56.038]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[00:44:56.438 --> 00:44:58.639]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.300]  PQQ, CoQ10.
[00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:10.356]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[00:45:10.776 --> 00:45:12.477]  They sell PQQ in little bottles.
[00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:22.804]  The third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:25.981]  Think about that.
[00:45:26.061 --> 00:45:26.902]  It's $74 right now.
[00:45:27.843 --> 00:45:32.827]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[00:45:33.807 --> 00:45:35.128]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[00:45:35.168 --> 00:45:43.515]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[00:45:43.855 --> 00:45:45.556]  So I signed a bigger contract, got a better deal.
[00:45:46.557 --> 00:45:52.342]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're going to want lower price on this and get the best product.
[00:45:52.362 --> 00:45:53.583]  So I've not gambled.
[00:45:54.163 --> 00:45:55.024]  I know you want value.
[00:45:55.064 --> 00:45:56.765]  So we've bought even more of it.
[00:45:57.686 --> 00:45:59.768]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it.
[00:46:00.328 --> 00:46:06.853]  And we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're going to find anywhere.
[00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:08.214]  DNA Force.
[00:46:08.314 --> 00:46:09.676]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[00:46:09.816 --> 00:46:10.356]  Thousands of them.
[00:46:10.636 --> 00:46:12.077]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[00:46:12.518 --> 00:46:13.459]  It is dramatic.
[00:46:14.665 --> 00:46:22.452]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[00:46:23.173 --> 00:46:31.680]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:38.846]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at InfoWareStore.com or you can call AAA253-3139.
[00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:47.268]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[00:46:47.468 --> 00:46:47.929]  That's fine.
[00:46:49.369 --> 00:46:50.429]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[00:46:50.849 --> 00:46:51.550]  I'm funded by you.
[00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.650]  So thank you all.
[00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:58.311]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[00:46:58.851 --> 00:47:01.572]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[00:47:05.813 --> 00:47:08.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:14.760]  Is the U.S.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:24.136]  involved with any procuring of weapons, transfer of weapons, buying, selling, anyhow transferring weapons to Turkey out of Libya?
[00:47:27.141 --> 00:47:27.803]  To Turkey?
[00:47:29.531 --> 00:47:30.913]  It is a big idea.
[00:47:30.933 --> 00:47:33.055]  A new world order.
[00:47:33.616 --> 00:47:37.280]  How is it that this organization is so well-funded, so organized?
[00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:44.408]  Islamic State-linked militants have gained a stronger foothold in Libya, seizing new economically vital areas of the country.
[00:47:44.748 --> 00:47:52.954]  The leader of ISIS in Libya is none other than Abdel-Hakim Belmahdj, and of course he was armed to the teeth by NATO.
[00:47:53.094 --> 00:47:57.037]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:47:57.297 --> 00:48:01.560]  The Russians say they're negotiating with North Korea to hold joint military exercises.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:07.224]  Kim Jong-un and Vladimir Putin teaming up, creating an ominous alliance against the United States.
[00:48:08.265 --> 00:48:15.413]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal that the US government is negotiating with Iran.
[00:48:15.573 --> 00:48:20.859]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared to allow Israeli jets into its airspace to conduct attacks on Iran.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.605]  We have an unprecedented opportunity to build a new world order.
[00:48:26.145 --> 00:48:32.347]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine and played an important part in events now.
[00:48:32.487 --> 00:48:36.809]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche of an international monetary fund aid package.
[00:48:36.869 --> 00:48:41.170]  We had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:43.391]  Vladimir Putin is on the move.
[00:48:45.718 --> 00:48:56.382]  Only when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order.
[00:48:56.402 --> 00:48:58.943]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:48:59.603 --> 00:49:07.426]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:49:11.867 --> 00:49:13.228]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:13.668 --> 00:49:13.988]  Later,
[00:49:15.365 --> 00:49:39.801]  In the broadcast, I am going to go over famous executive orders that have been reissued by subsequent presidents, allowing presidents to take control of all medicine, all transportation, to put citizens into forced labor work brigades that give the president, for even an economic crisis or any other crisis, total control over the media, over the means of production.
[00:49:40.541 --> 00:49:47.627]  That's why the globalists put all this power in the presidency and why they're so upset that the president now is back under the control of the people.
[00:49:48.567 --> 00:49:50.289]  That's how he was able to get us out of TPP.
[00:49:50.649 --> 00:50:02.939]  That's how he's been able to executively get rid of so many of these bureaucratic red tape nightmares that were designed to shut us down because they had given the president unconstitutionally
[00:50:04.605 --> 00:50:06.166]  All of this executive power.
[00:50:06.246 --> 00:50:10.209]  And Trump is using it to dismantle that system, and I'm praising that.
[00:50:10.749 --> 00:50:20.475]  But I can tell you right now, CNN and the rest of mainstream media are still in the hands of the deep state, to a great extent, openly working against the President, openly sabotaging things.
[00:50:20.556 --> 00:50:29.461]  But, when time of war kicks in, even the executives at those companies basically do what the Pentagon and the President is asking them.
[00:50:30.042 --> 00:50:33.124]  And when the President two and a half days ago, or two days ago, announced
[00:50:34.232 --> 00:50:40.198]  That he was pulling out of the Iran deal, and then Israel struck Syria, killing Iranians at a base.
[00:50:40.818 --> 00:50:45.323]  No coverage, but one thing on Fox, little thing on Drudge, and Infowars.com.
[00:50:47.048 --> 00:50:58.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, when war like that kicks off, that could really trigger a larger war, you know it's usually huge top stories, dun-dun-dun, you know, on the edge of war, war between Israel, war between Iran, will the U.S.
[00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.241]  be called in?
[00:50:59.261 --> 00:51:07.750]  You know, lots of images on CNN with graphics of how the base was hit, satellite photos, and cruise missiles were fired by the Israelis.
[00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:09.572]  Zero coverage.
[00:51:11.468 --> 00:51:21.160]  And that is, I can tell you for certain, not because I have the sources on this, but because I know how it works, the Pentagon said to the media, please do not cover this.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.703]  We're going into a potential full war scenario.
[00:51:24.624 --> 00:51:26.907]  And under war scenarios,
[00:51:28.038 --> 00:51:34.521]  The media, the production, the telephones, the internet, the UHF, the VHF, the cable.
[00:51:35.041 --> 00:51:42.204]  The government can hit one switch, the internet kill switch, and everything goes to government announcements, government text, government audio.
[00:51:43.225 --> 00:51:43.865]  It's a fact.
[00:51:44.645 --> 00:51:45.326]  It's law.
[00:51:45.906 --> 00:51:47.166]  Congress has passed this.
[00:51:47.847 --> 00:51:48.947]  They're executive orders.
[00:51:50.728 --> 00:51:52.709]  And I wasn't even criticizing Trump.
[00:51:52.889 --> 00:51:54.830]  I mean, I do criticize him when I think it's needed.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:02.004]  I think we're in very dangerous waters right now, but I'm not ready to criticize him because he's proven himself right over and over again, but I'm not going to give him blind faith.
[00:52:03.465 --> 00:52:06.727]  I'm going to give him tacit, guarded approval.
[00:52:06.867 --> 00:52:08.808]  Doesn't mean I'm God, that's just my personal view.
[00:52:09.188 --> 00:52:10.069]  I'm sure you've got yours.
[00:52:12.321 --> 00:52:16.405]  The fact that the media, day one and day two, had almost zero coverage.
[00:52:16.445 --> 00:52:20.748]  Finally today, the foreign press is all over this for two days, so they can't ignore it.
[00:52:20.808 --> 00:52:21.329]  It's out there.
[00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:22.750]  But that's a big issue.
[00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:25.813]  So later in the broadcast, anybody can search this themselves.
[00:52:25.833 --> 00:52:26.533]  Just go to Bing.
[00:52:26.553 --> 00:52:27.794]  Google's pretty much worthless.
[00:52:27.814 --> 00:52:30.377]  I don't want to plug Microsoft, but it's like the old Google.
[00:52:30.417 --> 00:52:31.137]  It works pretty good.
[00:52:31.457 --> 00:52:32.819]  That doesn't mean they can't control it later.
[00:52:32.999 --> 00:52:35.461]  Go to Start Page or a lot of other great independent sites.
[00:52:35.481 --> 00:52:38.003]  A lot of them feed off Google.
[00:52:38.363 --> 00:52:39.464]  They just protect your identity.
[00:52:40.458 --> 00:52:45.540]  And you can just search, executive orders, presidential executive orders for national emergencies.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.800]  Because each president reissues them with their own tailoring.
[00:52:49.301 --> 00:52:50.721]  And Trump has reissued all those.
[00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:57.323]  He declared an emergency a few months ago with the trafficking of men, women, and children.
[00:52:57.903 --> 00:53:03.725]  It allowed him to seize a lot of money and start rolling up the pedophile networks and things along that line.
[00:53:04.025 --> 00:53:04.825]  So this is real news.
[00:53:09.898 --> 00:53:13.299]  You know, Forbes, here it is, Obama's plan to seize control of our economy and our lives.
[00:53:13.779 --> 00:53:15.119]  And it shows we did it with executive orders.
[00:53:15.179 --> 00:53:20.521]  So, Trump has this power and that's why the globalists are so scared of him.
[00:53:20.541 --> 00:53:34.064]  This is the first real exercise of Trump's power that I've seen in the last 48 hours with CNN having zero coverage of this, even though they could spin it to say, look, Trump's an idiot.
[00:53:35.324 --> 00:53:37.325]  He pulled out of the deal and this is all kicked off.
[00:53:39.773 --> 00:53:45.458]  Now the word is John Kerry's behind the scenes telling the Iranians to start probing, start attacking, that that'll embarrass Trump.
[00:53:45.498 --> 00:53:48.701]  So Trump isn't in full control of the executive branch yet.
[00:53:49.962 --> 00:53:53.966]  I'm just pointing out this is the first sign that he is beginning to get control of it.
[00:53:55.606 --> 00:54:00.189]  But people should stop being like children and stop being so naive about who runs the media and who controls things.
[00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:03.471]  That's why the globalists hate local talk radio.
[00:54:03.491 --> 00:54:06.353]  That's why they hate independent news like Infowars.
[00:54:06.833 --> 00:54:08.254]  Because they want total control.
[00:54:08.675 --> 00:54:10.176]  Whether they be right-wing or left-wing.
[00:54:11.476 --> 00:54:15.439]  ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:54:15.459 --> 00:54:19.021]  Remember Gore Vidal famously, before he died, was on CNN.
[00:54:19.142 --> 00:54:20.963]  He goes, wow, I'm on CNN today.
[00:54:22.725 --> 00:54:26.088]  And there's no general in here or colonel during the breaks telling me what I can say.
[00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:29.252]  And then CNN later had to admit it was in the news.
[00:54:29.272 --> 00:54:37.520]  World Net Daily reported on it and said, no, we actually have on staff about 300 officers at our New York and Atlanta offices.
[00:54:38.661 --> 00:54:45.809]  And we've even got several generals full time at CNN Center in New York and in D.C.
[00:54:49.329 --> 00:54:50.430]  You can pull those articles up.
[00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:53.293]  CIA and top military run CNN.
[00:54:53.573 --> 00:54:55.075]  WorldNetDaily.com.
[00:54:55.335 --> 00:54:57.317]  And then it links to the press releases and admissions.
[00:54:57.397 --> 00:55:07.367]  So, there was also a press release four years ago by the Pentagon, a video press release by the deputy head of the Army.
[00:55:08.986 --> 00:55:16.127]  And also the Deputy Secretary of Defense, and our article about it was, Pentagon promises to stop lying because of the Drudge Report.
[00:55:16.507 --> 00:55:17.888]  Because they sourced the Drudge Report.
[00:55:17.908 --> 00:55:19.968]  They say, we're going to stop lying now.
[00:55:20.588 --> 00:55:21.488]  You've made the decision.
[00:55:21.508 --> 00:55:23.129]  This is when the Pentagon broke with Obama.
[00:55:23.689 --> 00:55:26.069]  And we're going to be embedded now in all your local media too.
[00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.769]  We're going to help you.
[00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.330]  And I thought, this is just ridiculous.
[00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:31.950]  They're not actually going to do this.
[00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:35.451]  And then like a strange Stranger Things episode,
[00:55:37.011 --> 00:55:40.552]  The CIA and military people started popping up all over the place.
[00:55:42.212 --> 00:55:44.772]  And so far, they've never given us any disinformation.
[00:55:45.893 --> 00:55:47.313]  But I just, I'm not stupid.
[00:55:47.353 --> 00:55:48.293]  I know what this is all about.
[00:55:48.373 --> 00:55:50.633]  So, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:55:56.134 --> 00:56:01.935]  Yeah, the guys pulled up a thing from 2017, which is not the crew's fault.
[00:56:01.975 --> 00:56:05.116]  When I throw this stuff out, they're supposed to find it, especially when it's 15 years old.
[00:56:07.185 --> 00:56:22.998]  The exact headline is, CNN centers staffed with CIA operatives, CIA and military operatives crafting news.
[00:56:23.538 --> 00:56:25.580]  That's your headline from 15 years ago.
[00:56:30.284 --> 00:56:36.489]  So that's just some of the news that we're going to be covering on that front, but I'm going to print
[00:56:37.671 --> 00:56:38.731]  I've been meaning to do this lately.
[00:56:38.751 --> 00:56:40.412]  I haven't done it, so I'm kind of doing it on the fly here.
[00:56:41.032 --> 00:56:43.052]  I mean to print the executive orders themselves.
[00:56:43.632 --> 00:56:46.713]  Type this in, crew, and for TV viewers and listeners as well.
[00:56:47.073 --> 00:56:54.115]  Just type in, list of executive orders transferring control to the presidency during emergencies.
[00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:56.055]  And then it'll go back to the 60s.
[00:56:56.515 --> 00:56:59.296]  This executive order that allows putting people in forced labor camps.
[00:56:59.716 --> 00:57:02.056]  This executive order that allows for total gun confiscation.
[00:57:02.456 --> 00:57:04.497]  This executive order for the entire takeover of the media.
[00:57:06.438 --> 00:57:12.683]  Give me some of the Obama kill switch articles out of Forbes and the Associated Press, because all of that's still in place.
[00:57:14.284 --> 00:57:18.267]  Now, we're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen, and I will come back with the whole North Korea thing and then a lot more.
[00:57:19.087 --> 00:57:24.511]  Don't forget, we are running two of the biggest specials ever, and these sales are going to have to end soon because both these products will sell out.
[00:57:24.891 --> 00:57:29.435]  Body is the ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcumin in level, and it's got five other ingredients as well.
[00:57:29.455 --> 00:57:32.457]  400 plus milligrams just of the turmeric in it.
[00:57:33.336 --> 00:57:33.916]  Thanks for your support!
[00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:57.132]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[00:57:57.172 --> 00:57:57.453]  Go ahead.
[00:57:57.573 --> 00:58:01.478]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[00:58:01.618 --> 00:58:06.564]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[00:58:06.584 --> 00:58:11.049]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day.
[00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:21.832]  To your full skill that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[00:58:22.473 --> 00:58:25.353]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[00:58:26.033 --> 00:58:29.674]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, five days a week.
[00:58:29.774 --> 00:58:36.616]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[00:58:36.756 --> 00:58:37.056]  I'm just
[00:58:37.256 --> 00:58:41.400]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.582]  How they're demonizing my state.
[00:58:43.662 --> 00:58:45.104]  I just can't stand it anymore.
[00:58:45.124 --> 00:58:50.068]  You have changed my life and for wars has changed my family's life.
[00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:56.154]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[00:58:56.214 --> 00:59:00.738]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[00:59:01.596 --> 00:59:02.897]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[00:59:03.097 --> 00:59:08.401]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[00:59:08.421 --> 00:59:09.742]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[00:59:09.782 --> 00:59:09.962]  Yeah.
[00:59:10.102 --> 00:59:11.983]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[00:59:12.023 --> 00:59:12.844]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[00:59:12.884 --> 00:59:14.565]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[00:59:14.605 --> 00:59:15.786]  We really appreciate you.
[00:59:15.946 --> 00:59:16.626]  Keep up the fight.
[00:59:16.666 --> 00:59:18.067]  We need to take California back.
[00:59:18.087 --> 00:59:18.468]  Thank you, Desiree.
[00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:19.568]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[00:59:19.628 --> 00:59:20.209]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[00:59:27.208 --> 00:59:35.978]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[00:59:36.398 --> 00:59:43.767]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:44.087 --> 00:59:46.209]  No longer 5% but now 10% at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:56.971 --> 01:00:06.519]  Receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.639 --> 01:00:13.444]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.684 --> 01:00:25.794]  When you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head, the first thing you do when you get up out of bed is hit that seat surrounding
[01:00:33.192 --> 01:00:48.842]  Well, last night I talked about how the mainstream media was not reporting on the tit-for-tat war between Iran and Israel starting up in the last two days and how that was totally unprecedented and that can only happen
[01:00:49.798 --> 01:00:58.304]  If the president began to enforce executive orders and activate presidential decision directives that allow total control of the mainstream media.
[01:00:59.144 --> 01:01:05.928]  And if they don't follow that, then physically they start flipping switches and government pre-announced information comes out.
[01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:14.294]  They have whole newsrooms staffed with Voice of America personnel that will then commandeer, that's the word, and take full control of our media.
[01:01:16.977 --> 01:01:23.658]  And if you're a radio listener and I'm putting all these executive orders, there's thousands of them up on screen because, again, they're reissued by each subsequent president.
[01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:30.980]  And it's not even my opinion or my interpretation.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.920]  Even mainstream media says this allows this.
[01:01:35.241 --> 01:01:40.342]  And the Cruz just found a bunch of executive orders and stuff I've never even seen before from the Clinton National Library, 2006.
[01:01:41.862 --> 01:01:42.462]  Print that for me.
[01:01:42.502 --> 01:01:42.862]  Amazing.
[01:01:43.463 --> 01:01:44.823]  It's actual interpretation
[01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:46.203]  I think?
[01:02:06.237 --> 01:02:07.837]  To go, oh no, you're full of it.
[01:02:08.397 --> 01:02:10.378]  Oh, Trump's not getting a peace deal with North Korea.
[01:02:10.838 --> 01:02:12.198]  Oh, the economy isn't at 3%.
[01:02:12.238 --> 01:02:16.099]  Oh, you know, they're not stopping illegal aliens.
[01:02:16.319 --> 01:02:17.959]  Oh, illegal aliens don't commit crimes.
[01:02:18.479 --> 01:02:20.940]  Oh, there's no executive orders to allow the total takeover.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.081]  Oh, cell phone radiation doesn't give you brain tumors or heart problems.
[01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:26.441]  Oh, fluoride doesn't cause any problems for you.
[01:02:26.881 --> 01:02:28.121]  Oh, you don't need iodine to live.
[01:02:29.902 --> 01:02:30.642]  Oh, and it's like...
[01:02:31.582 --> 01:02:38.526]  They think siding with the establishment makes them part of the establishment and these people aren't part of the establishment.
[01:02:41.027 --> 01:02:49.572]  And Trump is the establishment trying to be more pragmatic and trying to have victory for the world.
[01:02:56.035 --> 01:02:56.796]  And variants of it.
[01:02:56.816 --> 01:02:58.437]  I was just telling him something off-air.
[01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:03.393]  So when I come back, I'm going to play a ton of clips, and then we've got a guest joining us.
[01:03:04.054 --> 01:03:11.359]  Godfrey Bloom, who's a former member of the EU Parliament, a patriot, works with Nigel Farage, was highly recommended from Nigel Farage.
[01:03:11.379 --> 01:03:15.102]  He's been on years ago, and he is a bigger-than-life character.
[01:03:15.983 --> 01:03:20.227]  And we're looking at working with him on some things over there in the UK.
[01:03:21.187 --> 01:03:25.351]  And he, of course, has been pointing out that when people have their
[01:03:27.196 --> 01:03:27.476]  I don't know.
[01:03:46.363 --> 01:03:49.246]  And they knew what Nicholas Cruz was planning and the Sheriff's Department stood down.
[01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:50.206]  That's all confirmed.
[01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:53.229]  They lied before and said he wasn't part of the Promise Program.
[01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:55.311]  He'd been part of the Promise Program since early 2013.
[01:03:57.452 --> 01:03:59.954]  Vandalizing, threatening, attacking, you name it.
[01:04:00.075 --> 01:04:00.495]  Stealing.
[01:04:02.196 --> 01:04:03.537]  They all knew him as School Shooter.
[01:04:04.438 --> 01:04:07.140]  He constantly went around with toy guns saying, I'm going to kill you.
[01:04:07.841 --> 01:04:08.742]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:04:09.262 --> 01:04:11.044]  I'm going to come to school and murder everyone.
[01:04:11.364 --> 01:04:13.206]  And when he did come, there was a stand down.
[01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:20.809]  And when we reported on it, the media said that we said nobody died, so they could ban the videos we put out showing witnesses saying there was a standout.
[01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:23.291]  So that's the globalist media for you.
[01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:25.192]  But when we come back, a news blitz.
[01:04:25.873 --> 01:04:33.480]  I've already spent a lot of time on Israel, and the fact that they are currently basically at war with Iran, and this could escalate.
[01:04:35.212 --> 01:04:36.433]  In the Persian Gulf, or you name it.
[01:04:37.354 --> 01:04:41.016]  And it's just going to go on going, because they hit, they hit back, they hit, they hit back.
[01:04:41.637 --> 01:04:46.961]  I'm not anti-Israel, but still, I don't like the fact that they started this hours after Trump said he was pulling out of the deal.
[01:04:47.441 --> 01:04:48.301]  So I guess it escalated.
[01:04:48.322 --> 01:04:49.382]  They want to get this over with?
[01:04:49.422 --> 01:04:51.284]  They want to punch Iran in the nose?
[01:04:51.784 --> 01:04:55.827]  Iran has had a lot of really vicious rhetoric, which is asking for it.
[01:04:55.887 --> 01:04:58.469]  So this whole thing is spiraling out of control.
[01:04:58.509 --> 01:04:59.329]  Pray for peace, folks.
[01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:00.090]  We'll be back.
[01:05:03.204 --> 01:05:08.471]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:05:09.192 --> 01:05:12.496]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:05:13.337 --> 01:05:19.604]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:05:21.366 --> 01:05:27.710]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:33.773]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:05:34.373 --> 01:05:46.520]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.983]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:13.539 --> 01:06:17.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:25.062 --> 01:06:33.704]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:37.876 --> 01:07:01.771]  I have in my hand executive orders by John F. Kennedy, by Ronald Reagan, by George Bush Sr., by W, by all of them, allowing the total takeover of energy, commerce, defense, communications, putting people into work brigades, daring martial law, Obama's internet shutdown switch, BBC, Associated Press, Whitehouse.gov.
[01:07:02.732 --> 01:07:04.273]  Later in the broadcast I'm going to go over that.
[01:07:05.327 --> 01:07:25.377]  Because when the media didn't report anything in the first day and a half of the ongoing Israeli-Iranian war that's kicked off, when they've always reported on just stuff much smaller before, hell, Palestinian youth throwing stones, Israelis with water cannons.
[01:07:26.178 --> 01:07:32.121]  The fact that that's going on tells me that Trump has activated a national emergency.
[01:07:34.895 --> 01:07:35.856]  That's just a total fact.
[01:07:36.536 --> 01:07:37.397]  The power's there.
[01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:38.518]  It's in place.
[01:07:38.998 --> 01:07:40.440]  He's already done it on human smuggling.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:59.876]  And if you don't think it's a national emergency, that Iran has belligerently been violating their agreements and is threatening to nuke folks, or threatening to use weapons, and that Israel's threatening to attack them, both sides, and you've got Saudi Arabia now lined up on the side of Israel, wanting nuclear weapons,
[01:08:01.431 --> 01:08:03.454]  It isn't about which side you're on, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:03.495 --> 01:08:07.000]  It's about the fact that this whole thing is escalating very quickly.
[01:08:07.021 --> 01:08:14.673]  If you want to understand executive orders and martial law and COG, that'd be, what, police state four or five, dude.
[01:08:15.697 --> 01:08:16.497]  The Police State 4.
[01:08:16.918 --> 01:08:22.080]  He's been reviewing it to where he can pull up all the exact executive orders since I asked him 20 minutes ago to do it.
[01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:24.762]  They've already printed me now like over 40 documents.
[01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.364]  Executive Order of National Defense Resource Preparedness.
[01:08:29.384 --> 01:08:29.364]  2012.
[01:08:29.424 --> 01:08:31.125]  That's the really bad one with Obama.
[01:08:33.797 --> 01:08:36.098]  People probably ask Glass Tower how I knew this all happened in 2011-2012.
[01:08:36.118 --> 01:08:38.438]  Because it was a big deal then.
[01:08:38.758 --> 01:08:40.139]  It's like all over even mainstream news.
[01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:42.079]  Like, the Internet's kill switch is real!
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:45.821]  Why, everything including your smartphones under Obama's control!
[01:08:46.801 --> 01:08:48.921]  Why, the whole media does what Obama says!
[01:08:50.622 --> 01:08:53.963]  Remember, Michelle Obama was on the cover of thousands of publications.
[01:08:56.004 --> 01:09:00.385]  Melania hasn't been on one because the shadow government has been ignoring the president.
[01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:02.866]  Do I like Trump in control of the media?
[01:09:03.346 --> 01:09:03.546]  No.
[01:09:04.786 --> 01:09:10.808]  Like Drudge said, it's very dangerous to start calling CNN fake news and then saying maybe they should lose their license.
[01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:20.031]  As much as I'd like that, and as much as CNN is trying to get me shut down publicly, I'm not an authoritarian scumbag like them.
[01:09:22.891 --> 01:09:24.412]  And once you start down that road,
[01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:29.947]  Once you begin down that road of defining this, defining that, you're like the UK.
[01:09:29.987 --> 01:09:31.068]  And I've got that coming up.
[01:09:32.831 --> 01:09:39.599]  UK says sharing hate posts online could lead to six months in jail under newly proposed rules.
[01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:42.163]  I mean, wow!
[01:09:47.148 --> 01:09:48.008]  That is so huge.
[01:09:48.029 --> 01:09:51.010]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:54.832]  You can link through the article to just mainstream British news going, how great this is.
[01:09:54.872 --> 01:09:58.014]  Yeah, because they want all their competition shut down.
[01:09:58.434 --> 01:09:59.355]  This is frightening.
[01:10:00.575 --> 01:10:01.976]  Now, let's give them some positive news.
[01:10:02.576 --> 01:10:06.719]  Since July 27th, 1943, hard to believe 60 years ago, there has been
[01:10:14.147 --> 01:10:16.469]  A armistice, meaning a ceasefire.
[01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:28.520]  There's been a lot of firefights, a lot of deaths, a lot of ships being grabbed, artillery barrages, a lot of stuff the public doesn't even know about that's gone on there since 1953 until 2018.
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:33.985]  And you've had the globalists propping up North Korea.
[01:10:34.285 --> 01:10:38.428]  You've had the globalists using it as a detonator to play games in the Middle East, giving them the weapons.
[01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.871]  And now,
[01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:57.165]  Returning from North Korea with the newly confirmed Secretary of State Pompeo, President Trump has welcomed Americans home from North Korea.
[01:10:58.045 --> 01:10:59.826]  They are really three incredible people.
[01:11:00.646 --> 01:11:05.228]  And of course there's a lot of dramatic footage of that of them reunited with their families after years.
[01:11:06.389 --> 01:11:10.451]  But let's go ahead and roll some of the comments from the President on that.
[01:11:11.494 --> 01:11:15.039]  We very much appreciate that he allowed them to go before the meeting.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:25.573]  It was sort of understood that we'd be able to get these three terrific people during the meeting and bring them home after the meeting and
[01:11:26.534 --> 01:11:29.255]  It was nice in letting him go before the meeting.
[01:11:29.275 --> 01:11:33.356]  I mean, frankly, we didn't think this was going to happen, and it did.
[01:11:33.436 --> 01:11:37.017]  So, you could say we're a little bit ahead.
[01:11:37.097 --> 01:11:44.239]  It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out.
[01:11:46.279 --> 01:11:49.640]  Now, the next thing I want to go to is Robert Mueller.
[01:11:50.856 --> 01:11:53.738]  Now even a lot of Democrats are saying, okay, he's out of control.
[01:11:53.779 --> 01:11:55.340]  He went after stuff that wasn't Russia-related.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.641]  They found a bimbo.
[01:11:57.482 --> 01:12:00.804]  And they found a drug company in the U.S.
[01:12:01.225 --> 01:12:04.988]  giving money to Cohen that's totally legal for the lobbying work he was doing.
[01:12:05.648 --> 01:12:06.649]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:11.714]  But Pence won't even say the Russia investigation is a hoax.
[01:12:12.554 --> 01:12:18.039]  He just says that it's time for it to wrap up.
[01:12:18.179 --> 01:12:19.260]  Here is the Vice President.
[01:12:20.816 --> 01:12:22.237]  You knew him.
[01:12:22.417 --> 01:12:24.778]  He must have briefed you when you were a member of Congress.
[01:12:25.459 --> 01:12:26.219]  He's a Marine.
[01:12:26.359 --> 01:12:28.320]  He's a lifelong Republican.
[01:12:28.961 --> 01:12:31.382]  Do you think he can be trusted?
[01:12:31.402 --> 01:12:32.423]  Do you think he's a bad guy?
[01:12:34.148 --> 01:12:38.469]  Our administration has been fully cooperating with the Special Counsel.
[01:12:38.529 --> 01:12:40.090]  Do you think his investigation is a hoax?
[01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:41.290]  And will continue to.
[01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:47.172]  What I think is that it's been a year since this investigation began.
[01:12:48.252 --> 01:12:50.913]  Our administration has provided over a million documents.
[01:12:50.973 --> 01:12:52.494]  We fully cooperated in it.
[01:12:52.614 --> 01:12:55.815]  And in the interest of the country, I think it's time to wrap it up.
[01:12:56.615 --> 01:13:02.877]  And I would very respectfully encourage the Special Counsel and his team to do that.
[01:13:05.074 --> 01:13:18.238]  Now, again, the wrinkle to all of this is McCain, for the first year, saying, I did not give the dossier to BuzzFeed.
[01:13:19.179 --> 01:13:20.599]  And I'm not involved in the dossier.
[01:13:21.519 --> 01:13:22.920]  And it turns out he was involved the whole time.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.841]  Then recently, he said, OK, I was involved with some of the info in it.
[01:13:27.515 --> 01:13:32.296]  Opposition research firm behind Trump-Russia dossier now says it didn't give it to BuzzFeed.
[01:13:32.336 --> 01:13:41.158]  McCain says he didn't as well, but now he says he's proud of it and defends giving Trump dossier to Comey, who then gave it to him.
[01:13:41.218 --> 01:13:41.898]  So it's the same thing.
[01:13:43.598 --> 01:13:45.299]  Doody demanded I do it.
[01:13:46.159 --> 01:13:50.780]  And of course, Doody demanded you lie to us as well.
[01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:55.761]  Truly, truly disgusting.
[01:13:57.574 --> 01:14:02.357]  Now when we come back, I'm going to get to some really important information.
[01:14:03.237 --> 01:14:16.824]  I got sources, as you know, months ago that said they're planting false flags against the UN, against the Federal Reserve, against CNN, against MSNBC, against the mainstream media, against people like Megyn Kelly.
[01:14:18.786 --> 01:14:21.767]  That is a total loss, 60-something million dollars in the toilet.
[01:14:22.087 --> 01:14:22.968]  Nobody watches her.
[01:14:24.588 --> 01:14:26.713]  I wasn't told they're specifically planning to target her.
[01:14:26.733 --> 01:14:27.955]  I was told people like that.
[01:14:27.975 --> 01:14:35.952]  Because they're flushing Matt Lauer, they're flushing Tom Brokaw, they're flushing all these overpaid people.
[01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:44.602]  And they said that the false flag will be against their institutions, blaming it on Trump supporters and blaming it on you.
[01:14:45.242 --> 01:14:49.564]  Well, since then, ISIS has come out and said they're going to attack CNN, the Federal Reserve, mainstream media.
[01:14:50.164 --> 01:14:55.026]  And now CNN keeps saying it, they've said it again, that Trump's going to make his supporters attack them.
[01:14:57.488 --> 01:15:00.209]  So they are really, really, really telling you what's coming.
[01:15:03.075 --> 01:15:10.179]  And they're trying to set the precedent that my words are violent, Trump's words are violent, and that as a class of people, we don't deserve free speech.
[01:15:10.199 --> 01:15:11.980]  That's what these fake lawsuits are all about.
[01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.420]  My lawyer went to a D.C.
[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:14.541]  conference last weekend.
[01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:16.222]  I talked to another lawyer.
[01:15:16.242 --> 01:15:19.684]  It was such a big deal, I was talking to another lawyer, my family lawyer here yesterday.
[01:15:20.484 --> 01:15:25.365]  Who came to visit us, and he said, no, I talked to Harvey, another one of the lawyers that was at the conference.
[01:15:25.825 --> 01:15:29.206]  They said it was the most insane bizarreness they've ever seen.
[01:15:29.506 --> 01:15:30.606]  They were hyperventilating.
[01:15:30.646 --> 01:15:32.666]  There was thousands of people at this thing.
[01:15:33.146 --> 01:15:36.687]  And they had people on stage going, and they killed people at the pizza place!
[01:15:37.107 --> 01:15:38.327]  Jones sent them to kill!
[01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:46.549]  There were dead people, and people are dying, and Jones is sending people to kill the Sandy Hook people, and everyone's like, get him, get him, get him!
[01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:47.709]  Overturn the First Amendment!
[01:15:48.189 --> 01:15:49.790]  And the lawyers are like, no, it's true.
[01:15:50.271 --> 01:15:54.474]  They're planning to create a statute, an Alex Jones statute, and then ban everybody's free speech.
[01:15:55.495 --> 01:15:56.916]  It is the overturn of the First Amendment.
[01:15:57.257 --> 01:15:58.798]  So that's coming up on the other side.
[01:15:59.158 --> 01:16:01.060]  Newswars.com, Infowars.com.
[01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:13.923]  Owen Troyer here for InfoWars.com.
[01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:31.007]  Now, I am at City Council today to discuss an incident that happened on December 10, 2017, where I was trying to go to a memorial march for Kate Steinle, but I was met with armed masked men that prevented me from entering and were intimidating and threatening me.
[01:16:31.027 --> 01:16:32.788]  I'm going to bring this issue to City Council.
[01:16:33.008 --> 01:16:33.848]  Let's see how they take it.
[01:16:34.588 --> 01:16:37.231]  Alright, well I'm going to start by asking the council a question.
[01:16:37.271 --> 01:16:42.977]  Given everything that's happened in the month of March with the bombings and the police officers saying, if you see anything suspicious, say something.
[01:16:43.518 --> 01:16:49.404]  I think we would all agree that masked men walking around with firearms is something suspicious.
[01:16:49.424 --> 01:16:52.768]  Now I'm going to play this video for the council to review.
[01:16:55.256 --> 01:16:57.378]  That illustrates that exact thing happening.
[01:16:57.438 --> 01:17:03.242]  Now, I am a firm believer in the First Amendment right, so an individual has the right to walk around with their face covered.
[01:17:04.182 --> 01:17:05.804]  I'm a firm believer in the Second Amendment right.
[01:17:06.324 --> 01:17:10.547]  I believe in constitutional carry, so you can carry a rifle or whatever firearm you want with you.
[01:17:11.047 --> 01:17:11.428]  However,
[01:17:12.488 --> 01:17:13.209]  According to U.S.
[01:17:13.269 --> 01:17:36.783]  Code, Title 18, Part 1, Chapter 13, Subsection 241, Conspiracy Against Rights states, if two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any state, territory, commonwealth, or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured by him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised them the same, or two or
[01:17:36.783 --> 01:17:49.342]  More and more persons go in disguise or on the premises of another with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege so secured they shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years.
[01:17:50.424 --> 01:17:58.987]  Well, on December 10th, the video you're witnessing right now, I went to a memorial march for a deceased victim of a violent crime.
[01:17:59.467 --> 01:18:08.569]  And I was met, as you can see in these pictures, by masked men with arms on their triggers of rifles, battering clubs, etc.
[01:18:09.129 --> 01:18:13.991]  Here you can see this man has his finger on the trigger, keeping me from going to a park
[01:18:15.154 --> 01:18:22.299]  A memorial, here's them, with shields and clubs blocking the entrance from a park for a dead person's memorial.
[01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:26.842]  Now, if that doesn't violate the code, I don't know what does.
[01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:38.010]  And I find it timely that we sit here today with you all discussing getting more funding for police, but I did not hear one person make a suggestion to keep violent criminals off the streets.
[01:18:38.610 --> 01:18:50.083]  Well, maybe if we looked into sanctuary city laws and keeping masked men with guns off the streets, we wouldn't have to have a hundred police officers out there every time somebody wants to have a march, which is every weekend.
[01:18:51.324 --> 01:18:55.089]  Now, I'll just say this in closing and provide an illustration for you.
[01:19:07.569 --> 01:19:15.511]  If I was outside, holding a rifle, keeping people from getting into this city council to state their claim, do you think I should be arrested?
[01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:20.053]  I think everybody here would agree, yes, that should be an arrest.
[01:19:20.413 --> 01:19:21.053]  Absolutely.
[01:19:21.473 --> 01:19:25.994]  But for some reason, and I'm not blaming the APD, because I think they're good men and women.
[01:19:26.034 --> 01:19:28.155]  Most of my experiences with them have been positive.
[01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:43.424]  But if we're not going to arrest armed individuals with masks, brandishing weapons, intimidating people from their free speech, a clear violation of the law, I just want to know why, and I want to know if this city council thinks that that's the type of city that we should live in.
[01:19:43.644 --> 01:19:44.305]  Thank you for your time.
[01:19:44.325 --> 01:19:45.005]  Thank you.
[01:19:46.146 --> 01:19:51.229]  Mayor, if he would provide us with a link, because I couldn't see that.
[01:19:51.989 --> 01:19:53.070]  Absolutely, I'd be happy to.
[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.951]  Thank you.
[01:20:06.371 --> 01:20:08.974]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:24.145 --> 01:20:28.188]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:20:28.969 --> 01:20:30.390]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:31.811]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:37.055]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:41.259 --> 01:20:46.603]  Alright, I got a bunch of stuff I want to hit this segment before a guest joins us coming up with key information.
[01:20:49.497 --> 01:20:57.803]  And that's, again, CNN putting out the talking point that Trump's causing violence, I'm causing violence, we have to be removed from office, or I have to be banned.
[01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:10.251]  And that is the official PR drive, just like they've done in Europe, saying you can't hurt somebody's feelings, or your hate speech is going to cause violence, and then they can define it however they want.
[01:21:10.391 --> 01:21:10.971]  That's here.
[01:21:12.032 --> 01:21:17.536]  Then, I want to talk about the First Lady, Melania, who I'm a big fan of,
[01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:24.473]  Kind of getting on the bandwagon of stopping bullying in schools.
[01:21:25.294 --> 01:21:26.775]  Well, yeah, it's good to stop bullying.
[01:21:26.995 --> 01:21:30.699]  It's good to have good educational environments, but kids are always going to be mean.
[01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:34.242]  And if you try to shelter them, you're going to create basket cases.
[01:21:37.586 --> 01:21:41.670]  I mean, that said, I grew up in Dallas, and it was kind of a reverse racism thing.
[01:21:42.290 --> 01:21:45.774]  The schools let the minority students beat up the white kids.
[01:21:47.116 --> 01:21:53.159]  Who were, a lot of times, many years younger because some of the minority kids, like other white kids, had flunked grades.
[01:21:53.419 --> 01:21:57.742]  And I had thug white guys who'd flunked a couple of grades and start fights as well.
[01:21:58.802 --> 01:21:59.923]  But, I mean, I grew up in Dallas.
[01:21:59.943 --> 01:22:01.323]  It was very violent.
[01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:02.564]  Extremely.
[01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:08.427]  Not a lot of stabbing and shooting when I went to school, but a lot of really serious people going to the hospital, fights.
[01:22:08.947 --> 01:22:10.488]  People were going to the hospital by 8th grade.
[01:22:11.168 --> 01:22:13.730]  They were, people were dying by the 10th grade.
[01:22:14.585 --> 01:22:18.087]  That's why my parents sold their house, their dental offices, and we moved to Austin.
[01:22:18.127 --> 01:22:19.067]  Totally different culture.
[01:22:19.548 --> 01:22:22.149]  I never even saw a fight at Anderson High School.
[01:22:23.150 --> 01:22:24.030]  Totally different world!
[01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:26.111]  I was like, this is awesome!
[01:22:27.092 --> 01:22:28.172]  This is wonderful!
[01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:32.094]  I thought growing up it was like a, you know, gladiator episode or something.
[01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:35.656]  But, I'm a lot stronger person because of it.
[01:22:35.676 --> 01:22:36.597]  But I'm already digressing.
[01:22:36.637 --> 01:22:37.457]  I'm gonna get into that.
[01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:43.281]  Because, just like she's getting roped into that, and Trump's getting roped into saying, you know, let's shut down CNN.
[01:22:45.834 --> 01:22:47.055]  That's becoming what we're fighting.
[01:22:47.275 --> 01:22:48.796]  So I'm going to cover that coming up as well.
[01:22:49.957 --> 01:22:52.319]  That said, I have some information about CNN.
[01:22:53.259 --> 01:22:56.622]  The last time I got this information, in fact, I was going to cover this last night.
[01:22:56.642 --> 01:22:57.682]  It was in my stack in here.
[01:22:57.702 --> 01:22:59.664]  I never did the report on it.
[01:22:59.684 --> 01:23:02.365]  I asked Rob Dewey where that stack last night when it was in here.
[01:23:02.886 --> 01:23:04.007]  We were in there at like six o'clock.
[01:23:05.388 --> 01:23:10.951]  It's got a whole stack and I wrote notes on a piece of paper with my source of what I was going to cover.
[01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:14.792]  And I've got to find that stack that I left in here last night.
[01:23:14.812 --> 01:23:15.712]  You guys might have taken it.
[01:23:15.972 --> 01:23:30.842]  And I've got to find that sheet, because there's so much news that I intended to cover this when I started the show today, but then more missile attacks went on between Israel and Iranian forces, and so I got distracted.
[01:23:30.862 --> 01:23:37.266]  And I was going to shoot a special report last night, and I was just tired, and I went home to see my wife and children.
[01:23:39.224 --> 01:23:46.308]  But it's a big piece of news, and I got it from two sources.
[01:23:46.748 --> 01:23:50.271]  One about a month ago, and then I got it again yesterday from another source.
[01:23:50.911 --> 01:23:58.996]  And one of the sources told me specifically about the Time Warner AT&T merger about a year and a half ago.
[01:23:59.016 --> 01:24:06.140]  And inside baseball on that, because they were at dinner with the lobbyists, a bunch of the lobbyists,
[01:24:07.973 --> 01:24:10.414]  And then I saw that play out just like they said.
[01:24:12.355 --> 01:24:14.116]  But let me just give you the announcement.
[01:24:14.956 --> 01:24:16.277]  And it's a little bit nuanced.
[01:24:17.197 --> 01:24:17.558]  You know what?
[01:24:17.638 --> 01:24:19.599]  I'm not going to give you the announcement until I find my notes.
[01:24:20.359 --> 01:24:21.840]  I am so angry right now at myself.
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:25.241]  I just meticulously was on the phone for 45 minutes writing these notes.
[01:24:26.102 --> 01:24:28.443]  And then getting everything to back up what I was even told.
[01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:29.783]  Because a lot of this is already public.
[01:24:30.103 --> 01:24:31.244]  But it's not really known.
[01:24:31.884 --> 01:24:34.025]  And then it deals with the future of CNN.
[01:24:37.196 --> 01:24:39.038]  The President doesn't need to shut it down.
[01:24:39.058 --> 01:24:40.699]  And of course, the President knows that.
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.901]  Because it's already shut itself down.
[01:24:43.442 --> 01:24:45.063]  And the decision is how to get rid of it.
[01:24:47.486 --> 01:24:52.350]  So, I have this thing where I say, coming up, and I can't control myself.
[01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:53.031]  Everybody knows that.
[01:24:53.391 --> 01:24:55.834]  Other talk shows, build it up, build it up, build it up, give it to you.
[01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:59.597]  I'm like, next hour we're going to cover the secret of blah blah blah blah blah.
[01:25:01.237 --> 01:25:06.638]  It's not that I'm holding it till later, it's that I don't have my notes or my stack of news that backs a lot of it up.
[01:25:06.658 --> 01:25:26.304]  Just like I told you about Korea, and how they had sent their head of intelligence to meet with him in early March, and how I was told that they'd already tacitly agreed to all this, there'd be a re-merger over 10 years, with coal plants and businesses, and that all this was going to be unfolding, and that they would then release all of it.
[01:25:26.484 --> 01:25:28.464]  And that's because we have those sources.
[01:25:28.504 --> 01:25:30.485]  But this is pretty big, so that's going to come up.
[01:25:31.471 --> 01:25:33.914]  I've almost already burned through this segment, just talking about that.
[01:25:35.936 --> 01:25:38.299]  I need to really spend proper time on the CNN thing.
[01:25:38.599 --> 01:25:41.262]  Let me look how many guests I have, because I'm the one that loads the show up with guests.
[01:25:43.064 --> 01:25:44.546]  And then I won't have time to get to it.
[01:25:47.249 --> 01:25:48.591]  Godfrey Bloom is on.
[01:25:52.481 --> 01:25:53.681]  Excellent, amazing guest.
[01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:54.362]  That's coming up.
[01:25:54.862 --> 01:25:59.243]  Matt Bracken, I took over his hour this week, so I said, hey, come on as a guest for an hour.
[01:25:59.543 --> 01:26:01.244]  But then he got another hour, another day.
[01:26:01.264 --> 01:26:02.764]  And I always want to hear from Matt.
[01:26:03.104 --> 01:26:04.965]  Let's do 30 minutes with Matt instead of an hour.
[01:26:05.845 --> 01:26:08.466]  And at 1 o'clock, if I can find my notes, an article.
[01:26:10.347 --> 01:26:12.568]  I may have to abort covering this unless I find my notes.
[01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:15.569]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[01:26:15.789 --> 01:26:16.530]  I can't remember.
[01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:19.030]  I can remember it all, but I'll get something wrong.
[01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:23.151]  And I want to give it out exactly because it's so intriguing.
[01:26:23.191 --> 01:26:24.212]  This is really intriguing.
[01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:27.732]  You want me to let it out, folks?
[01:26:31.794 --> 01:26:32.594]  I can't even do it.
[01:26:33.274 --> 01:26:33.894]  I can't even do it.
[01:26:33.954 --> 01:26:37.155]  It's so hilarious what CNN's doing.
[01:26:38.686 --> 01:26:44.193]  Because if CNN gets rid of Trump, it's already been decided they're shutting it down and even getting rid of the name.
[01:26:45.495 --> 01:26:56.328]  And they don't even know at CNN that he's the only reason they've got any ratings or any funding, and if they get him out, CNN 100% is going to close its doors.
[01:26:57.352 --> 01:26:58.833]  Headline news and CNN.
[01:26:58.853 --> 01:26:59.673]  The decision's been made.
[01:27:00.274 --> 01:27:02.875]  Now, that could change, but that's the decision right now.
[01:27:03.516 --> 01:27:03.936]  It's gone.
[01:27:04.456 --> 01:27:04.997]  It's trash.
[01:27:05.297 --> 01:27:05.837]  It's garbage.
[01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:09.439]  Just like the Washington Post and the New York Times are propped up by these kingpins.
[01:27:09.459 --> 01:27:12.481]  You're always seeing articles about, oh, they're getting some more subscriptions.
[01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:13.362]  Oh, they're popular now.
[01:27:13.682 --> 01:27:14.142]  Bull!
[01:27:14.703 --> 01:27:15.223]  Baloney!
[01:27:17.739 --> 01:27:18.480]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:21.143]  So I'll have to punt into the next hour on that because our guest is coming up.
[01:27:21.163 --> 01:27:24.025]  And on the Melania thing, and on the free speech thing, and on the thing in the UK.
[01:27:24.506 --> 01:27:27.349]  And on people having their smart homes taken over by Bezos.
[01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:28.390]  That's in the news.
[01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:30.312]  Amazon wants to run your house.
[01:27:30.572 --> 01:27:33.014]  It's showing what it's like to have a home completely controlled by Alexa.
[01:27:34.336 --> 01:27:35.717]  What a horrible idea that is.
[01:27:36.057 --> 01:27:37.779]  Oh, there's no appliances watching us, Jones!
[01:27:37.799 --> 01:27:38.420]  You're insane!
[01:27:39.738 --> 01:27:40.318]  Twenty years ago.
[01:27:41.359 --> 01:27:43.139]  So, that's been the plan.
[01:27:43.519 --> 01:27:45.360]  Briefly, we're not funded by Soros.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:46.721]  We're not funded by the Globalists.
[01:27:47.061 --> 01:27:49.802]  We're not funded by this whole New World Order system.
[01:27:50.862 --> 01:27:51.683]  We're funded by you.
[01:27:51.823 --> 01:27:56.384]  And something I've dropped the ball on is we have put out like 30 new t-shirts.
[01:27:56.584 --> 01:27:57.905]  It's more than 30 in the last year.
[01:27:58.445 --> 01:28:00.046]  And I don't even promote t-shirts anymore.
[01:28:01.107 --> 01:28:04.872]  A lot of these are really soft, nice fabric, designer, summer athletic cut.
[01:28:05.052 --> 01:28:06.814]  We put out six or seven shirts for women.
[01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:09.337]  Women were asking for that.
[01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:13.443]  We've just got camo shirts, military green shirts.
[01:28:15.914 --> 01:28:19.196]  These are the best shirts we've ever produced, plus all the classic ones.
[01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:22.979]  And then we've got collector's editions, where we only print a few thousand.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.521]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:29.123]  We've got well over 150 shirts right now.
[01:28:29.704 --> 01:28:34.307]  And, you know, the 5-10 bucks we make on these, when you buy them, that helps fund our operation.
[01:28:34.507 --> 01:28:35.147]  But here's the big thing.
[01:28:35.427 --> 01:28:36.688]  It's starting the adventure.
[01:28:36.989 --> 01:28:41.472]  Because you go out in the Patriot area, you'll get your lunch bought for you, probably, or meet your new best friend.
[01:28:41.912 --> 01:28:44.794]  You go into other areas, you might get coffee dumped on your head.
[01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:46.095]  Or physically attacked.
[01:28:46.115 --> 01:28:47.436]  So it's choose your own adventure.
[01:28:47.956 --> 01:28:49.317]  The video game in the real world.
[01:28:49.337 --> 01:28:50.978]  You're not looking for imaginary Pokemons.
[01:28:51.278 --> 01:28:53.600]  You're out looking for other Patriots wearing your colors loud and proud.
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.403]  Get your Patriot apparel at infowarestore.com and choose your adventure today.
[01:29:02.367 --> 01:29:05.968]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:29:06.348 --> 01:29:08.789]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:29:09.089 --> 01:29:13.450]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.770]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[01:29:23.012 --> 01:29:23.852]  Or wherever you go.

[01:30:02.492 --> 01:30:03.112]  Mike in Arizona.
[01:30:03.132 --> 01:30:04.373]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:30:04.393 --> 01:30:04.694]  Go ahead.
[01:30:05.644 --> 01:30:07.546]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:30:07.586 --> 01:30:16.955]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:30:17.763 --> 01:30:24.329]  And as a long-time InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce AnthroPlex.
[01:30:24.529 --> 01:30:26.691]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the AnthroPlex, too.
[01:30:26.791 --> 01:30:27.191]  Thank you.
[01:30:27.852 --> 01:30:30.314]  I use the BioTrue Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste.
[01:30:30.354 --> 01:30:34.097]  For you folks who aren't big normal toothpaste fans, the Super Blue is awesome.
[01:30:34.658 --> 01:30:37.640]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[01:30:37.680 --> 01:30:38.661]  They are quality.
[01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:40.283]  I can't wait to get some more.
[01:30:40.743 --> 01:30:43.465]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[01:30:43.625 --> 01:30:44.146]  Absolutely.
[01:30:44.687 --> 01:30:57.589]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order, and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:31:04.253 --> 01:31:22.559]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:31:22.659 --> 01:31:28.061]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:31:28.942 --> 01:31:29.622]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:31:30.062 --> 01:31:32.863]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:31:33.543 --> 01:31:34.524]  And so much more.
[01:31:35.085 --> 01:31:36.205]  It is concentrated.
[01:31:36.426 --> 01:31:38.147]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:31:38.227 --> 01:31:43.851]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:31:43.971 --> 01:31:45.172]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:31:45.192 --> 01:31:47.113]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:31:47.194 --> 01:31:49.595]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:31:49.795 --> 01:31:51.056]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:31:51.237 --> 01:31:53.038]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:31:53.598 --> 01:31:54.199]  Immune Wall.
[01:31:54.299 --> 01:31:55.620]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.921]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:02.296 --> 01:32:05.498]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:32:05.938 --> 01:32:07.259]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:32:07.739 --> 01:32:19.285]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:32:19.965 --> 01:32:28.830]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:35.112]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:32:35.332 --> 01:32:39.993]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:42.814]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:32:43.155 --> 01:32:44.515]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:32:44.895 --> 01:32:54.518]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:32:54.618 --> 01:32:56.719]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[01:32:57.279 --> 01:33:02.188]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:33:05.874 --> 01:33:08.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:24.176 --> 01:33:24.797]  You found it.
[01:33:25.338 --> 01:33:28.041]  The front lines of the human awakening.
[01:33:28.401 --> 01:33:30.043]  It's the Infowar.
[01:33:30.124 --> 01:33:32.727]  And now, Alex Jones.
[01:33:40.512 --> 01:33:45.755]  Now, Godfrey Blum is our guest and I want to play a clip of Godfrey Blum here in just a moment.
[01:33:46.215 --> 01:33:53.279]  Godfrey Blum is a libertarian author with six books published on both military history and Austrian School of Economics, so he's a Ron Paul type guy.
[01:33:53.779 --> 01:33:57.381]  He worked in the city of London where he won an international prize for fund management.
[01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:09.908]  He was a member of the EU Parliament for 10 years and his speeches in the chamber attracted over 70 million views, exposing state bank and tax malpractice as well as deep state corruption.
[01:34:13.208 --> 01:34:20.492]  He was a member of the EU Parliament, and he's going to give us his insight on where the EU is going, because again, the Parliament is ceremonial.
[01:34:21.152 --> 01:34:30.857]  He brought experience, if not influence, in the Monetary and Economic Affairs Committee, where he was sitting as a member of putting the European Central Bank President under unaccustomed pressure.
[01:34:31.317 --> 01:34:35.040]  He's an associate member of the Royal College of Defense Studies and graduate in geopolitical strategy.
[01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:42.525]  His latest book, The Magic of Banking, The Coming Collapse, and A Guide to Libertarianism, can both be found on Amazon paperback and Kindle version.
[01:34:42.826 --> 01:34:44.767]  GodfreyBloom.uk.
[01:34:44.947 --> 01:34:52.733]  And in the words of Nigel Farage, who's larger than life, Godfrey Bloom's probably the largest of life person he knows.
[01:34:53.233 --> 01:34:55.155]  He said about a week ago on a phone call with me.
[01:34:55.695 --> 01:34:56.196]  Uh, well... Well, uh...
[01:35:18.248 --> 01:35:22.791]  There was a chap who was attacked in the middle of the night.
[01:35:23.712 --> 01:35:29.996]  He wrested the knife off the guy and he stabbed him with it and killed him.
[01:35:31.257 --> 01:35:34.659]  And bloody good job too, and that's what we should all do.
[01:35:34.699 --> 01:35:42.004]  And I got really cross when he was arrested and I threatened everybody with my sword if they broke into me at the middle of the night, that's what they'd get.
[01:35:44.266 --> 01:35:58.884]  Now, I want to play this clip and then get into the geopolitical and military areas that you're really an expert in, but how did the UK get to this point of taking the guns, letting the Islamists in, having the exploding crime, the Assad attacks, now more dangerous than New York City, and Sadiq Khan?
[01:35:59.304 --> 01:36:12.448]  You know he's up there saying we need to have restrictions on knives and if you defend yourself famously you know from burglars the third time and shoot them with a secret shotgun you go to prison but the the gypsies don't get in trouble.
[01:36:12.528 --> 01:36:19.390]  I mean why is the government of the UK and also the US and other liberal governments just worshipping and coddling criminals?
[01:36:19.470 --> 01:36:22.291]  What is the what is the unifying endgame Godfrey?
[01:36:23.997 --> 01:36:34.520]  Well, I think there's a desire to break down, as all with communists and socialists, is to break down, if you can, society so you can install the system that you want.
[01:36:34.860 --> 01:36:39.361]  So we have to get to a total breakdown before this can actually happen.
[01:36:39.401 --> 01:36:41.282]  And so what they're trying to do is break it down.
[01:36:41.642 --> 01:36:44.603]  And they do it by a method of secret societies.
[01:36:44.643 --> 01:36:52.465]  So one of the leading secret societies we have here at the moment is an organisation called Common Purpose.
[01:36:53.986 --> 01:36:57.311]  And you have to be a member of that if you're going to be promoted.
[01:36:58.953 --> 01:37:01.316]  It's sort of secret handshakes and stuff like that.
[01:37:01.616 --> 01:37:08.905]  And they're all committed to actually not work with the people who pay their salaries, but work against them.
[01:37:09.185 --> 01:37:11.268]  So we've got ourselves into this terrible mess.
[01:37:11.768 --> 01:37:21.397]  This terrible situation and we've really got to do something about it but we can't do anything about it until we get rid of those people and we get rid of our civil service who are all making this happen.
[01:37:21.678 --> 01:37:28.124]  Our civil service now runs the country, not politicians and I rather think in the United States you're finding that out as well.
[01:37:29.531 --> 01:37:30.091]  Exactly.
[01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:37.475]  We've got the former head of the CIA and NSA openly saying, if you're in government, don't do what the executive branch says.
[01:37:37.895 --> 01:37:38.975]  Don't follow orders.
[01:37:39.636 --> 01:37:40.256]  Block him.
[01:37:40.316 --> 01:37:41.096]  Sabotage him.
[01:37:41.116 --> 01:37:51.141]  And I have an article here out of the UK, the Daily Mail, UK sharing hate posts that they define online could lead to six months in jail under newly proposed rules.
[01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:53.022]  Say that the Prophet Muhammad
[01:37:53.682 --> 01:37:54.563]  Marry a nine-year-old.
[01:37:54.723 --> 01:37:55.323]  It's a fact.
[01:37:55.584 --> 01:37:56.484]  Six months in jail.
[01:37:57.225 --> 01:37:59.126]  Say that we shouldn't sexualize young children.
[01:38:00.127 --> 01:38:01.708]  And give them, quote, gay education.
[01:38:01.808 --> 01:38:02.689]  Six months in jail.
[01:38:02.969 --> 01:38:05.451]  This is like Iron Curtain level censorship.
[01:38:07.410 --> 01:38:12.533]  Oh, I think, Alex, this is something the East German police, the Stasi, would have died for.
[01:38:12.833 --> 01:38:15.995]  This is far, far in advance of anything they were allowed to do.
[01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:20.358]  You can now get arrested, and it's actually happened, for quoting the Bible.
[01:38:20.798 --> 01:38:27.282]  You can stand in the market square and quote bits of the Bible, and you can be arrested for it, for disturbing the peace.
[01:38:28.524 --> 01:38:37.481]  You know, we live in this absolutely crazy situation, but we also live in a situation where if it's Islam, you're bulletproof, you cannot be arrested.
[01:38:37.501 --> 01:38:38.904]  And if you are...
[01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:47.151]  If you're a politician, if you come from an ethnic minority, you can pretty well say exactly what you like, say anything what you like.
[01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:54.034]  If you are white, or middle class, or of the indigenous population, you'll be horribly vilified straight away.
[01:38:54.054 --> 01:38:58.435]  So the whole thing's being turned on its head.
[01:38:58.815 --> 01:39:02.937]  It's really quite upsetting, and of course the whole country's absolutely bewildered by it.
[01:39:02.957 --> 01:39:06.898]  And we got rid of the House of Lords, which was our amending chamber,
[01:39:08.539 --> 01:39:20.245]  It was politicised by Tony Blair because although it was a rather eccentric organisation, the House of Lords, it actually had people who were real Lords, not fake Lords that we have now.
[01:39:20.525 --> 01:39:27.209]  People that were real Earls and Dukes and Viscounts, whose families had been in this country for years and years and years.
[01:39:27.469 --> 01:39:30.491]  So they had the stewardship of the country at their heart.
[01:39:30.991 --> 01:39:32.692]  They were great stewards of the country.
[01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:36.833]  And it was a force, broadly speaking, for good and common sense.
[01:39:37.113 --> 01:39:38.153]  That's all changed now.
[01:39:38.653 --> 01:39:39.813]  They put cronies in.
[01:39:40.033 --> 01:39:45.995]  They're all failed politicians, civil servants with hidden agendas.
[01:39:46.595 --> 01:39:50.896]  So, consequently now, they don't represent anybody.
[01:39:50.916 --> 01:39:52.536]  They certainly don't represent the country.
[01:39:52.556 --> 01:39:56.937]  And of course they're quite open about the fact now that they're trying to thwart Brexit, which is
[01:39:58.716 --> 01:39:59.857]  You know, the will of the people.
[01:39:59.917 --> 01:40:03.220]  The House of Commons mandated the electorate to vote.
[01:40:03.301 --> 01:40:15.091]  The Prime Minister wrote a letter to every family in the land saying that the Commons, the House of Commons, would carry out the will of the people on this, whether they voted yes or no.
[01:40:15.131 --> 01:40:19.495]  And of course the Prime Minister said the other day, David Cameron, we ought to vote to stay.
[01:40:19.616 --> 01:40:22.058]  But he said if you don't vote to stay, we'll carry out your wishes.
[01:40:22.922 --> 01:40:27.644]  And then what people forget is that we had a general election within just a few months.
[01:40:28.424 --> 01:40:32.646]  And on both red and blue, Labour and Conservative, of course we've got red and blue just like you.
[01:40:32.666 --> 01:40:36.247]  You've got Democrats or Republicans, we have Labour or Conservative.
[01:40:36.447 --> 01:40:40.969]  We get the choice of two very poor choices, incidentally I'm afraid, very poor choices.
[01:40:41.589 --> 01:40:53.256]  And so what actually happens there is that these people have thwarted the will of the people because on both red and blue the manifesto was to leave, was to carry out Brexit.
[01:40:53.536 --> 01:41:08.605]  So the whole country, 72 million people voted to leave the European Union and nobody's taking the slightest bit of notice because we're no longer run by the people, by the electorate, we're run by a small cabal of people in Parliament and the civil service.
[01:41:08.985 --> 01:41:31.844]  Wouldn't it be fair to say you've traded out hereditary royalty and people that actually then went along with the Magna Carta and the whole new system that became the world model of freedom and have replaced it with shadowy international mega cartels that have created new bureaucratic royalty whose goal is total division of the population, the atomization of it, for absolute
[01:41:32.725 --> 01:41:34.567]  Hegemonic control.
[01:41:34.607 --> 01:41:41.134]  I mean, this is the great game writ large to the next level trying to, I mean, directly destroy culture.
[01:41:42.175 --> 01:41:45.058]  And A, do you agree with that?
[01:41:45.159 --> 01:41:48.002]  And B, how big is the pushback?
[01:41:48.042 --> 01:41:49.443]  We see populism exploding.
[01:41:49.463 --> 01:41:51.686]  We see a lot of people awakening to this.
[01:41:51.746 --> 01:41:54.649]  But is that death throes or is that major pushback?
[01:41:55.962 --> 01:42:09.109]  Well, a lot of people are surprised because obviously as a graduate of the Royal College of Defence Studies and being an ex-politician and a member of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I'm used to dealing with these people.
[01:42:10.214 --> 01:42:13.136]  And I just knew how much power that they had.
[01:42:13.596 --> 01:42:19.279]  But I think the ordinary population here are beginning to understand by whom they are governed.
[01:42:19.839 --> 01:42:21.400]  These people, they've never heard of these people.
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:23.401]  These people are popping up all over the place.
[01:42:23.821 --> 01:42:27.843]  People are saying in the pubs and clubs, especially in the north of Milligan, who are these people?
[01:42:28.064 --> 01:42:29.304]  I've never heard of these people.
[01:42:29.904 --> 01:42:32.646]  And what you've got to understand, it's the same as America.
[01:42:32.666 --> 01:42:33.406]  It's no different.
[01:42:33.426 --> 01:42:34.427]  I visit America a lot.
[01:42:35.067 --> 01:42:36.388]  Uh, and I've got a lot of American fans.
[01:42:36.588 --> 01:42:55.241]  What you've got to bear in mind in the, uh, in the United Kingdom, uh, it's a little bit bit like, imagine being on a train where all the passengers want to go to Birmingham, uh, but of course, uh, they will vote to go to Birmingham, but the driver of the train and the conductor of the train don't think that's a good idea, they want to go to Edinburgh.
[01:42:55.541 --> 01:43:00.445]  It doesn't matter how much... Stay there, Godfrey Bloom, we'll talk about it on the other side in Common Purpose as well, this is critical.
[01:43:02.798 --> 01:43:04.219]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[01:43:53.344 --> 01:43:54.425]  That means it's pure.

[01:43:57.487 --> 01:44:00.249]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:44:00.289 --> 01:44:01.910]  Take action now before we sell out.
[01:44:06.894 --> 01:44:10.138]  You know, everybody, my critics told me that I can't talk to you.
[01:44:10.178 --> 01:44:11.660]  You know that, right?
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:18.448]  They attacked me and said, he's been on InfoWars, so we can't listen to anything he says that might be productive and useful.
[01:44:19.650 --> 01:44:22.153]  But I say Kanye changed everything.
[01:44:22.914 --> 01:44:24.596]  And, you know, I can love you.
[01:44:24.676 --> 01:44:25.878]  I don't have to disagree with you.
[01:44:26.548 --> 01:44:30.250]  So, I'm going to take Kanye's lead and say, I'm Switzerland.
[01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:34.312]  I'll go on whatever show wants me to talk to their audience and share my opinion.
[01:44:34.492 --> 01:44:39.734]  This whole freedom of speech business, it's a big, big idea and it keeps working.
[01:44:40.094 --> 01:44:47.458]  Like every time we get a little more freedom of speech, people are a little happier and they act surprised and say, whoa, freedom of speech worked again.
[01:44:48.198 --> 01:44:49.239]  I don't know.
[01:45:09.838 --> 01:45:13.080]  We had a chance, I know you've been tweeting your stuff, and it's not like I'm enamored with a star.
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:18.663]  I'm enamored by top tier, you know, second or third, first, largest music person in the world.
[01:45:18.763 --> 01:45:19.903]  I think we've hit the tipping point.
[01:45:19.943 --> 01:45:22.785]  As you said during the break, in your own words, something's happening.
[01:45:23.145 --> 01:45:24.986]  So can you speak to that and what is happening?
[01:45:25.186 --> 01:45:34.232]  There seems to be some kind of shift in, you know, I hate to go to New Age, but, you know, because it would be easy to go into woo-woo land.
[01:45:34.612 --> 01:45:38.075]  But it feels like the way people are looking at things is changing.
[01:45:38.315 --> 01:45:39.796]  Now, Trump is a big part of that.
[01:45:39.916 --> 01:45:41.217]  North Korea is a big part.
[01:45:41.337 --> 01:45:42.358]  Kanye is a part.
[01:45:43.038 --> 01:45:52.664]  And I think that people are noticing that when we think in non-traditional ways and get out of the box and say, OK, we thought this was impossible.
[01:45:53.165 --> 01:45:54.646]  Let's just think, what if it isn't?
[01:45:55.487 --> 01:46:01.859]  So maybe the whole thing is just simply defined by possibility and I think that our notion of what is possible is
[01:46:02.785 --> 01:46:03.106]  Got it.
[01:46:03.206 --> 01:46:04.367]  Got expanded recently.
[01:46:04.847 --> 01:46:07.150]  North Korea and Kanye being the best examples of it.
[01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:08.812]  But I think there's more to come.
[01:46:09.012 --> 01:46:13.897]  It just, you know, I'm not going to get scientific about this because I can't offer you data.
[01:46:14.377 --> 01:46:25.109]  But now that the physical problems have been solved, you know, we can get enough physical resources to where we need it if we can figure out, you know, where to put it and how to get it there.
[01:46:26.389 --> 01:46:31.970]  So, we're in a world where there's great possibility, and we're being held back by the way we think of things.
[01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:37.051]  And we're watching that the way we think of things is being changed by thought leaders.
[01:46:37.431 --> 01:46:46.353]  I'll tell you, you know, when I was first asked to come on the show today by your producer, my first thought was, I'm too busy, too much going on, I'd love to, but I don't have time.
[01:46:46.933 --> 01:46:52.834]  And then I saw people telling me in the news, hey, you can't go on InfoWars, and I said, well, I'm going to clear my schedule now.
[01:46:53.294 --> 01:46:55.735]  Because Kanye says I can talk to anybody I want.
[01:46:57.155 --> 01:46:59.176]  So, it's changing things.
[01:47:05.918 --> 01:47:08.639]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.861 --> 01:47:14.881]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:47:15.001 --> 01:47:17.222]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:40.404]  Well, I expect you've heard about this old aged pensioner who's been arrested by the police for defending his home from two thugs in the middle of the night who were threatening his wife, threatening to rob him.
[01:47:40.704 --> 01:47:43.965]  They were armed with screwdrivers, a couple of nasty thugs.
[01:47:44.965 --> 01:47:52.487]  Uh, and I know it's sub judice-y, but it seems like he dispatched one of them and sent one of them off, uh, in defense of his home.
[01:47:52.527 --> 01:48:06.610]  Now, I'd like to know, I'd like to know, what other country, what other country in the world would have arrested a 78-year-old old-age pensioner for defending his wife and defending his house in the middle of the night?
[01:48:06.910 --> 01:48:09.171]  I know of no other country where he would have been arrested.
[01:48:10.106 --> 01:48:10.946]  And he's been arrested.
[01:48:11.227 --> 01:48:15.088]  It shows the decadence, the debts to which our country has sunk.
[01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:25.493]  The Crown Prosecution Service, the not-fit-for-purpose Home Office, the common-purpose Chief Constables, the whole rabble, rabble that now run our country.
[01:48:25.954 --> 01:48:27.514]  I can't believe he's been arrested.
[01:48:27.534 --> 01:48:30.316]  I'm furious, and I bet you're furious too.
[01:48:30.976 --> 01:48:33.837]  Particularly interesting, because I used to live in Hither Green when I was in London.
[01:48:33.857 --> 01:48:35.318]  I've lived in Hither Green for many years.
[01:48:35.658 --> 01:48:40.080]  My grandmother lived in Hither Green for many scores of years.
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:42.681]  And it's not a particularly rough sort of place.
[01:48:43.541 --> 01:48:46.702]  And I just can't believe that this has happened, that he's been arrested.
[01:48:47.723 --> 01:48:49.123]  But let me just say one thing.
[01:48:49.163 --> 01:48:50.884]  Let me make one thing very clear.
[01:48:51.905 --> 01:48:52.885]  I'm still pretty fit.
[01:48:53.005 --> 01:48:53.865]  I'm ex-army.
[01:48:54.205 --> 01:48:55.806]  And this is my old army sword.
[01:48:56.226 --> 01:48:57.607]  This is my old army sword.
[01:48:58.590 --> 01:48:59.070]  Okay?
[01:48:59.091 --> 01:49:02.153]  You break into my house in the middle of the night.
[01:49:03.594 --> 01:49:06.277]  You dare do something like that and you'll get this.
[01:49:06.817 --> 01:49:08.659]  Make no mistake, you'll get this.
[01:49:09.079 --> 01:49:13.683]  As is my freeborn right as an Englishman, defend my family.
[01:49:13.703 --> 01:49:21.770]  I will defend my house, I will defend my family with my regimental sword and the Crown Prosecution Service can go to the devil.
[01:49:23.891 --> 01:49:27.772]  Now, I was talking to Nigel Farage last week, and he said, have you seen that video with 7 million views on YouTube?
[01:49:27.792 --> 01:49:28.212]  And I said, no.
[01:49:28.232 --> 01:49:30.473]  And I went and looked it up, it had like 8 million views by then.
[01:49:30.493 --> 01:49:31.893]  I went on Facebook, didn't even know about that.
[01:49:31.953 --> 01:49:33.673]  It was like 9 million over there.
[01:49:34.114 --> 01:49:35.594]  And that shows how hungry people are.
[01:49:35.614 --> 01:49:42.376]  And we've got to have Godfrey Bloom back up for a full hour to get into banks, and his books, and military history, and geopolitically what's happening currently.
[01:49:42.736 --> 01:49:45.576]  I was just, you know, introducing him back to this audience here.
[01:49:45.596 --> 01:49:49.297]  If we want to work with him more, we're looking for folks that want to actually reporting in the UK.
[01:49:49.597 --> 01:49:51.618]  So that's something down the road we're trying to build right now.
[01:49:52.574 --> 01:49:52.794]  I don't
[01:50:12.512 --> 01:50:16.553]  The corporations don't want it, but it's kind of being handed about right now, so that's coming up.
[01:50:16.573 --> 01:50:35.360]  But I want to just do kind of a snapshot view with Godfrey Bloom, who's a really respected military historian, expert in banking, you name it, about the current state of the world and what the globalists are doing, why the big banks are funding socialism and communism, how they have these national groups like Common Purpose in the UK.
[01:50:36.779 --> 01:50:51.546]  Carnegie Foundation, others here, all the big leftist organizations, where Cruz, the shooter at Parkland, was protected for four years, death-threatening people, robbing, vandalizing, stealing, you name it.
[01:50:52.346 --> 01:50:54.047]  And it's the same thing with these Islamists.
[01:50:54.927 --> 01:50:57.708]  High courts in Europe, Israel, can rape little girls.
[01:50:57.948 --> 01:50:58.849]  It's mainstream news.
[01:50:58.909 --> 01:51:00.009]  It can kill people.
[01:51:00.349 --> 01:51:01.510]  It's like they're above the law.
[01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:03.531]  This is part of a destabilization strategy.
[01:51:03.991 --> 01:51:18.047]  That he absolutely hit the target with, so I want him to finish up with that, and then give us a snapshot, geopolitically, what he sees happening in the world, who the different players are versus the populist, the capitalist, the nationalist, the pro-Christian, pro...
[01:51:18.988 --> 01:51:23.351]  Liberty, pro-success, common sense world that comes out of the UK.
[01:51:23.391 --> 01:51:29.915]  I'm not a Anglophile here, but England ended slavery worldwide except in a few Muslim areas.
[01:51:30.235 --> 01:51:32.516]  Now you read the news you think Israel invented slavery.
[01:51:32.736 --> 01:51:41.622]  The West is what gave women their rights and everything and then how have we now had it turned back on us using our goodwill against us in this guilt-ridden system.
[01:51:42.142 --> 01:51:42.943]  It's just insane.
[01:51:42.963 --> 01:51:46.765]  So I want you to finish up with that sir and give us a big picture on the state of the world right now as a
[01:51:47.146 --> 01:51:50.180]  Well-known, respected historian and former member of the EU Parliament.
[01:51:51.742 --> 01:51:59.448]  Well, in the United Kingdom, they didn't just get rid of the House of Lords, and this process has been going on for some time.
[01:52:00.069 --> 01:52:10.476]  They've got rid of the primary situation of the Christian faith, is something else that's been got rid of.
[01:52:11.237 --> 01:52:20.024]  Her Majesty the Queen is the head of the church, but the Archbishops of Canterbury have been chosen by the Prime Ministers of the day.
[01:52:20.664 --> 01:52:28.518]  And they have consistently produced Archbishops of Canterbury who have no interest in preaching the gospel at all.
[01:52:28.538 --> 01:52:30.442]  Wasn't one bishop a Wiccan?
[01:52:30.642 --> 01:52:33.567]  Wasn't one of the head bishops a Wiccan, doesn't even believe in Christ?
[01:52:35.209 --> 01:52:37.391]  Yeah, well that was actually the Bishop of Durham, yeah.
[01:52:37.971 --> 01:52:39.092]  That was a few years ago.
[01:52:39.112 --> 01:52:46.336]  So we've got the heads of the Anglican Church in the United Kingdom are a waste of space.
[01:52:46.376 --> 01:52:47.497]  They're absolutely hopeless.
[01:52:47.757 --> 01:52:50.599]  So that's one pillar of society that they got rid of.
[01:52:51.079 --> 01:52:54.721]  The other pillar of society that they got rid of was the family, the traditional family.
[01:52:55.381 --> 01:52:59.864]  Mum and Dad and the kids and the role model of a father and the working father.
[01:53:00.344 --> 01:53:08.208]  They got rid of all that by taking away any tax advantage you had by getting married and having children in the traditional way.
[01:53:08.728 --> 01:53:10.769]  We now have a welfare system which pays
[01:53:12.450 --> 01:53:13.851]  And this is an admitted...
[01:53:27.295 --> 01:53:30.077]  The plan of the big mega banks working with the communists.
[01:53:30.437 --> 01:53:31.378]  How do we stop them?
[01:53:31.478 --> 01:53:38.302]  And is this, as I said earlier, because you're a smart guy, is this a global awakening where we're on the offense and are going to win?
[01:53:38.502 --> 01:53:39.803]  Or is it a death rattle?
[01:53:40.123 --> 01:53:42.425]  And what's your real assessment?
[01:53:43.827 --> 01:53:51.512]  Well, the problem that we have is one of the democracy, the system of democracy that we have.
[01:53:51.812 --> 01:53:56.235]  And the only person who is really seriously challenging this at the moment, of course, is Hans Hopper.
[01:53:56.556 --> 01:53:58.057]  And you'll be familiar with his work.
[01:53:58.497 --> 01:54:06.262]  Now, if you go back to ancient Athens and the concept of democracy, Alex, this is the problem that we have now.
[01:54:06.742 --> 01:54:11.445]  It was never, ever the idea that you've got to vote just because you were 18 years old.
[01:54:12.748 --> 01:54:14.765]  You have to be a contributor to the system.
[01:54:15.672 --> 01:54:17.313]  You had to contribute to the system.
[01:54:18.014 --> 01:54:30.022]  And of course, even Oliver Cromwell, if we fast forward right up to the 1600s, Oliver Cromwell, the great parliamentarian, suggested it isn't quite right that you should get a vote just by breathing the air.
[01:54:30.082 --> 01:54:32.804]  And I quote him, you shouldn't get a vote just by breathing the air.
[01:54:33.084 --> 01:54:34.926]  You should contribute to society.
[01:54:35.526 --> 01:54:38.008]  And if you don't contribute to society, you shouldn't get a vote.
[01:54:38.048 --> 01:54:40.129]  What we now have now is two sorts of welfare.
[01:54:40.409 --> 01:54:42.511]  We have social welfare and corporate welfare.
[01:54:43.513 --> 01:54:54.745]  So we have big business who are getting subsidies on a daily basis, landowners, and of course, at the other end of society, we have at the bottom end of the scale, we have people who are permanently on social welfare.
[01:54:55.346 --> 01:54:57.689]  And they all vote in their own self-interest.
[01:54:57.709 --> 01:55:01.092]  Well it's like Mitt Romney said, once you get 57% on the dole, it's over.
[01:55:01.817 --> 01:55:03.338]  Because they will enslave the other half.
[01:55:04.219 --> 01:55:06.461]  Well, yes, and it's not just on the dole, Alex.
[01:55:06.561 --> 01:55:08.022]  It's people in the public sector.
[01:55:08.402 --> 01:55:09.703]  It's people in the public sector.
[01:55:09.943 --> 01:55:13.886]  We have the local boss at the town hall on £200,000 a year.
[01:55:14.547 --> 01:55:18.310]  We have the head of the National Health Trust on £200,000 a year.
[01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:26.476]  Well, ordinary hard-working people, Ray, maybe mechanics, cab drivers, hairdressers, are struggling just to get by.
[01:55:26.496 --> 01:55:27.757]  And what do they make, like £20,000?
[01:55:27.797 --> 01:55:27.757]  £20,000? £30,000?
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:40.011]  The average wage in this country, across the country, is about £28,000, that's about $37,000 a year, because it does tend to vary.
[01:55:40.251 --> 01:55:47.320]  But give you an idea of this, how wrong it's gone in our National Health Service, which is a ludicrous disgrace, the way it's run at the moment.
[01:55:48.251 --> 01:55:57.200]  We have 1.6 million people employed in the National Health Service, less than half of whom have any medical qualification whatsoever.
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:09.473]  Oh yeah, I saw the article, just to interrupt you, we've got to head back again for a full hour or longer, Godfrey Bloom with us, where the little girl has the leg four inches too short, they could easily do a surgery and fix it here, and they're telling her they're going to chop her leg off.
[01:56:11.079 --> 01:56:22.591]  Well that's the kind of nonsense that you end up with when you have chief executives on £200,000 a year and a fully trained theatre nurse, which is at the top of her profession, earning £32,000 a year.
[01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:24.473]  The whole thing is topsy-turvy.
[01:56:24.953 --> 01:56:26.715]  We've got to get rid of these freeloaders.
[01:56:26.755 --> 01:56:27.115]  I think?
[01:56:46.338 --> 01:56:48.579]  I was about to say, don't we have the social compact that's been broken?
[01:57:11.941 --> 01:57:17.446]  Oh, it's been completely broken, and it's been broken by the people with whom we placed our trust.
[01:57:17.566 --> 01:57:19.628]  Politicians as civil servants.
[01:57:20.349 --> 01:57:22.390]  I think there's going to be a night of the long knives.
[01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:24.752]  I could see it ending up a bit like the French Revolution.
[01:57:24.772 --> 01:57:25.493]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:57:25.533 --> 01:57:27.295]  We've got five more minutes with you, Godfrey Bloom.
[01:57:27.315 --> 01:57:28.356]  We come back in two minutes.
[01:57:28.776 --> 01:57:35.402]  I want to ask you, you're a smart historian, military historian, mainline historian, a major leader in the UK for folks here in the US watching you.
[01:57:36.783 --> 01:57:38.144]  At a gut level, how do you see it ending?
[01:57:38.244 --> 01:57:39.785]  I agree, because I'm not going along with this.
[01:57:40.165 --> 01:57:41.286]  I'm trying to fix it peacefully.
[01:57:41.326 --> 01:57:46.090]  They're getting violent, and they're going to keep pushing it and keep starting it, and they're going to reap the whirlwind.
[01:57:46.370 --> 01:57:46.851]  We'll be back.
[01:57:46.931 --> 01:57:47.431]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.175 --> 01:58:01.002]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[01:58:02.236 --> 01:58:04.038]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[01:58:04.078 --> 01:58:11.205]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[01:58:11.606 --> 01:58:17.391]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[01:58:18.092 --> 01:58:39.068]  Our ancestors knew work, so let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[01:58:40.149 --> 01:58:44.271]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[01:58:44.591 --> 01:58:49.873]  Because, I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about thousands of years ago is true.
[01:58:50.273 --> 01:58:51.313]  As above, so below.
[01:58:51.894 --> 01:58:54.715]  What you see happening on the mass scale, is also happening on the...
[01:58:55.595 --> 01:58:56.676]  Most tiniest scales.
[01:58:57.196 --> 01:58:58.297]  And that's what this comes down to.
[01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:00.199]  America is building its wall.
[01:59:00.599 --> 01:59:01.080]  Will it work?
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:01.740]  We don't know.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:02.801]  Is Trump right?
[01:59:03.482 --> 01:59:05.603]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[01:59:06.104 --> 01:59:12.069]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[01:59:12.449 --> 01:59:18.334]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[01:59:19.074 --> 01:59:25.356]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[01:59:26.116 --> 01:59:41.121]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[01:59:41.781 --> 01:59:44.164]  This is a 360 non-zero-sum game win.
[01:59:44.805 --> 01:59:48.049]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at m4warslife.com.
[01:59:48.389 --> 01:59:52.134]  Discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[01:59:54.557 --> 02:00:00.485]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:13.869 --> 02:00:17.814]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:18.254 --> 02:00:20.637]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.538 --> 02:00:33.551]  You see, if we don't admit we're under this global system, or the EU makes 90% of the UK's laws and they never voted to be part of it, and we never admit that we're under an unelected system, we can't elect a president who'll pull us out of the TPP.
[02:00:34.252 --> 02:00:40.716]  We can't elect people in the British Parliament that will get them out of the unelected EU system.
[02:00:41.476 --> 02:00:44.398]  And again, he was a member of the Parliament, Godfrey Bloom, but that's ceremonial.
[02:00:44.778 --> 02:00:48.140]  You've got the permanent bureaucracy like a Soviet Public Bureau.
[02:00:48.180 --> 02:00:56.845]  So I want to get Godfrey Bloom on for a full hour next week, if he can do it, to get into his books, The Magic of Banking, The Coming Collapse, A Guide to Libertarianism, and so much more.
[02:00:56.885 --> 02:00:58.686]  But just in the five minutes we have left, sir,
[02:00:59.466 --> 02:01:08.249]  Um, getting into the sense of what you're saying that people are going to really start getting aggressive here when the producers basically shrug like Atlas shrugged.
[02:01:08.609 --> 02:01:15.132]  And then and then your view on the world economic system and why these wars are kicking off and what you see in your crystal ball.
[02:01:16.827 --> 02:01:34.807]  Well, of course, there are a number of things we'll do to sort of encapsulate in a few minutes, but we've read, I'm sure most of your listeners would have read or be aware of General Eisenhower's autobiography when he said, beware, beware of the industrial military complex, which, of course, is just follow the money.
[02:01:35.488 --> 02:01:37.851]  War, a lot of people make a lot of money out of war.
[02:01:38.932 --> 02:01:42.114]  It's young men, ordinary young men that get their legs blown off and get killed.
[02:01:42.134 --> 02:01:45.396]  A lot of people sit at home in armchairs making money out of war.
[02:01:46.117 --> 02:01:50.099]  So that's one of the problems that is very difficult to get rid of.
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:54.482]  And when it comes to freedom, freedom has to be consistently fought for.
[02:01:54.702 --> 02:01:56.724]  You can't fight for it once and hope it's going to be there.
[02:01:57.084 --> 02:02:02.908]  The Americans have fought two wars of independence.
[02:02:03.188 --> 02:02:06.751]  One was against the British Empire and the one of course was a civil war.
[02:02:07.512 --> 02:02:08.593]  North versus the South.
[02:02:09.193 --> 02:02:14.338]  A lot of people don't understand it, or know about it, but the British have actually had four civil wars.
[02:02:14.358 --> 02:02:21.826]  King Stephen against Matilda, the War of the Roses, the first civil war in the 1600s, and the second, to get where we actually chopped off Charles I's head.
[02:02:22.446 --> 02:02:24.248]  There was a restoration about 20 years later.
[02:02:24.268 --> 02:02:27.772]  I was about to say, you had the Defender of the Faiths, you mentioned Cromwell, he was the last one, right?
[02:02:29.456 --> 02:02:29.976]  That's right.
[02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:31.557]  He was the last head of the Commonwealth.
[02:02:32.558 --> 02:02:34.640]  And that didn't work out very well for us.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.121]  But it's a constant thing.
[02:02:36.141 --> 02:02:37.542]  It isn't a one-off thing.
[02:02:37.762 --> 02:02:43.887]  The French had to have their revolution, and they just exchanged King Louis for Napoleon.
[02:02:44.067 --> 02:02:45.328]  They got exactly the same deal.
[02:02:45.348 --> 02:02:47.750]  They just got somebody who was a little bit, perhaps, more efficient.
[02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:50.812]  But he still killed lots of young men with his wars.
[02:02:51.612 --> 02:02:53.273]  So this is a constant problem.
[02:02:53.293 --> 02:02:54.453]  This is a constant thing.
[02:02:55.014 --> 02:02:58.395]  And if we are thwarted in our... Brexit is a wonderful example.
[02:02:58.715 --> 02:03:05.999]  If we're thwarted in our leaving after we've had a referendum, we've had a mandate given to Parliament by the people twice.
[02:03:06.119 --> 02:03:07.839]  Once in a referendum, once in a general election.
[02:03:08.179 --> 02:03:13.442]  If still they're thwarting it, and I said this in one of my recent podcasts on my
[02:03:15.316 --> 02:03:16.137]  On my website.
[02:03:16.578 --> 02:03:18.600]  I simply don't know any other alternative.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:25.768]  I simply can't understand what else we can do except march to London the 71 people who voted to leave and burn the bloody place down.
[02:03:26.288 --> 02:03:28.611]  Somebody else give me a better idea because I don't have one.
[02:03:28.631 --> 02:03:34.398]  Well you're right when you've got foreign traders who are selling you out and you don't have a vote and they're an occupational group.
[02:03:35.198 --> 02:03:42.662]  And they're trying to take your free speech and trying to use your tax money to bring in a bunch of foreigners to become the police and the bureaucrats to suppress you.
[02:03:43.082 --> 02:03:46.584]  At a certain point, they think our reluctance is a sign of weakness.
[02:03:47.225 --> 02:03:48.925]  They take our kindness as a sign of weakness.
[02:03:48.966 --> 02:03:49.446]  It's not!
[02:03:49.986 --> 02:03:56.952]  And historically it shows when the producers and the workers actually fight back, these parasites are going to run for the hills quite quickly.
[02:03:57.233 --> 02:03:59.134]  But I think they now realize humanity's awakening.
[02:03:59.495 --> 02:04:03.138]  Speaking of that, your podcast, all of it, godfreybloom.uk.
[02:04:03.938 --> 02:04:05.420]  Can you join us for a full hour next week?
[02:04:06.644 --> 02:04:09.886]  I certainly hope I can, I just need to check up with one of my colleagues.
[02:04:09.926 --> 02:04:11.127]  But I certainly hope I can.
[02:04:11.808 --> 02:04:23.036]  Because, yeah, I know we've got a lot of stuff we need to talk at least next week off air about some plans because, you know, we've been working on some things behind the scenes to launch some stuff in the UK and then a little bird told me you might be one of the guys that wants to do that.
[02:04:23.957 --> 02:04:25.518]  Well, I certainly do want to.
[02:04:25.538 --> 02:04:26.338]  That was no question.
[02:04:26.959 --> 02:04:28.460]  I'm in deepest Wales next week.
[02:04:29.581 --> 02:04:30.261]  All right, buddy.
[02:04:30.281 --> 02:04:31.062]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:31.102 --> 02:04:31.682]  Godfrey Bloom.
[02:04:31.702 --> 02:04:32.123]  God bless.
[02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.930]  Thank you.
[02:04:34.571 --> 02:04:39.054]  All right, we'll be back as the global resistance against tyranny accelerates into hyperdrive.
[02:04:39.474 --> 02:04:40.675]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:04:41.055 --> 02:04:42.956]  NewsWars.com is the newest site.
[02:04:43.257 --> 02:04:44.197]  We're redoing InfoWars.
[02:04:44.217 --> 02:04:45.758]  It's still a great site, but it's an older design.
[02:04:46.039 --> 02:04:47.980]  And PrisonPlanet.com is our UK backup.
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.301]  InfoWarsStore.com is how you finances.
[02:04:50.602 --> 02:04:51.582]  You are our financiers.
[02:04:51.602 --> 02:04:53.304]  Without you, we will fall to Soros.
[02:04:53.584 --> 02:04:54.724]  We will fall to the EU.
[02:04:54.965 --> 02:04:55.965]  We will fall to the globalists.
[02:04:55.985 --> 02:04:57.707]  But with you, we will defeat them together.
[02:04:57.727 --> 02:04:58.067]  We'll be back.
[02:05:02.884 --> 02:05:08.889]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:05:09.269 --> 02:05:11.871]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:05:12.471 --> 02:05:15.934]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:16.174 --> 02:05:20.438]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:20.878 --> 02:05:24.140]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:25.041 --> 02:05:35.265]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:36.025 --> 02:05:44.568]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:46.209 --> 02:05:54.755]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:05:55.255 --> 02:05:59.538]  Try Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:15.677 --> 02:06:17.798]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:18.258 --> 02:06:19.719]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.206 --> 02:06:33.348]  Last night I had a very interesting phone call with an individual.
[02:06:33.368 --> 02:06:35.629]  It was not Roger Stone.
[02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:38.371]  And he gave me
[02:06:39.748 --> 02:06:44.274]  Big details of CNN and its future and the media in this country.
[02:06:45.055 --> 02:06:50.241]  And I wrote some notes that we won't document cam here because I don't want to show all these on television.
[02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:52.744]  Radio listeners, I'll be breaking it down.
[02:06:53.649 --> 02:07:09.921]  And then I thought, even though his voice has gone from hundreds of interviews the last few days and weeks, since he's been the focus of the fake Mueller probe, but I realized that a lot of what I was told by this high-level individual is similar things that Roger Stone told me a year and a half ago, and then six months ago, and then a few weeks ago when he was here in town.
[02:07:11.603 --> 02:07:15.265]  And I don't just get into this because it's gossip about CNN.
[02:07:16.086 --> 02:07:17.307]  CNN on average has about 200,000 viewers.
[02:07:19.011 --> 02:07:20.692]  His top shows have a million and a half.
[02:07:20.752 --> 02:07:21.653]  I mean, they're a joke.
[02:07:21.973 --> 02:07:23.254]  They're force-fed in hotels.
[02:07:23.274 --> 02:07:24.395]  They're force-fed in bars.
[02:07:24.756 --> 02:07:28.479]  They're force-fed in train stations and airports.
[02:07:28.899 --> 02:07:35.704]  They pay to put the TVs in and pay for the cable and sometimes actually pay money on top of it to be force-fed.
[02:07:37.245 --> 02:07:41.989]  It's like government cheese or synthetic gin in the imaginary world of 1984.
[02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:46.052]  You want to avoid it at all costs.
[02:07:46.092 --> 02:07:47.614]  So, it's already dead.
[02:07:48.629 --> 02:08:01.074]  But it's interesting, while we're getting Roger on, because he finally answered the phone, it's interesting to know this because it just ties into how things work.
[02:08:02.094 --> 02:08:04.495]  Most people look at a news story one-dimensionally.
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:06.861]  Or two-dimensionally, maybe.
[02:08:07.582 --> 02:08:09.925]  But what about looking at it third-dimensionally, fourth-dimensionally?
[02:08:09.945 --> 02:08:11.867]  That's what they call, you know, this 3D chesh.
[02:08:12.748 --> 02:08:16.052]  Looking out, projecting how it's going to have ripples in the pond.
[02:08:17.273 --> 02:08:21.819]  So then, I was going to cover this last night, but then I wanted to talk to Roger.
[02:08:21.859 --> 02:08:22.820]  I never got around to calling him.
[02:08:25.131 --> 02:08:25.511]  I don't know.
[02:08:48.248 --> 02:08:53.191]  But this was again a year and a half ago, and then in the last few months I heard more, and it's been all over the news.
[02:08:53.892 --> 02:09:10.682]  But this other source, who will go unnamed, laid out that the DOJ is proposing that AT&T exclude DirecTV or Turner from the Time Warner deal, if they're going to merge with Time Warner because Time Warner owns CNN.
[02:09:15.185 --> 02:09:16.966]  Now the big concern here is,
[02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:20.190]  Again, this is very complex, but I'm just gonna lay it out.
[02:09:23.112 --> 02:09:33.679]  It's not really a monopoly issue to merge AT&T and Time Warner, because AT&T does not have that big of media holdings.
[02:09:34.619 --> 02:09:41.524]  They're more a telecommunications company, and Time Warner has a bunch of failing and ailing and low-rated properties.
[02:09:42.805 --> 02:09:43.565]  It's legacy.
[02:09:44.386 --> 02:09:46.387]  It's two feet in the grave.
[02:09:47.714 --> 02:09:48.415]  That's the thinking.
[02:09:49.316 --> 02:09:54.582]  And so the two kind of need to merge together to even have any shot at contending with Google.
[02:09:56.084 --> 02:09:56.785]  And Facebook.
[02:09:58.907 --> 02:09:59.348]  And Twitter.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:04.361]  That are, and Amazon with its own streaming services.
[02:10:04.461 --> 02:10:08.522]  I mean, Amazon's bigger than, you know, all the legacy media combined.
[02:10:09.042 --> 02:10:12.242]  I mean, Bezos makes $12 billion a day some days.
[02:10:12.823 --> 02:10:15.043]  I mean, he's worth $160 billion now or something.
[02:10:15.323 --> 02:10:18.324]  Next week will be $170 billion, $200 billion, $300 billion.
[02:10:19.784 --> 02:10:23.765]  So this whole thing about these companies merging, you know, being a monopolies of red herring.
[02:10:23.785 --> 02:10:27.866]  I mean, if you want to break them up, start with Google.
[02:10:29.463 --> 02:10:29.983]  Amazon.
[02:10:30.764 --> 02:10:31.625]  Probably Amazon first.
[02:10:31.745 --> 02:10:34.847]  Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:10:34.867 --> 02:10:37.329]  You know, Twitter's part owned by Amazon.
[02:10:37.349 --> 02:10:39.371]  I mean, when you talk about these things, it's all interconnected.
[02:10:39.411 --> 02:10:40.632]  Bezos is really the kingpin.
[02:10:42.193 --> 02:10:47.917]  He's really super anti-American, super monopolistic, super hyper-psycho-aggressive.
[02:10:47.997 --> 02:10:49.238]  He's not a free market dude.
[02:10:49.278 --> 02:10:52.601]  He's real bad news for standard living in society.
[02:10:52.641 --> 02:10:53.582]  He is a creepazoid.
[02:10:54.653 --> 02:10:56.515]  Wants you to live in 250 square foot apartments.
[02:10:56.615 --> 02:10:59.257]  I mean, he's... wants your house to be AI run by him.
[02:10:59.277 --> 02:11:00.779]  I mean, delusions of grandeur?
[02:11:01.259 --> 02:11:02.020]  Baby, he's it.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:04.022]  He is the problem.
[02:11:05.343 --> 02:11:06.724]  Now, and by the way, you see the news.
[02:11:06.764 --> 02:11:07.865]  Trump's obsessed with Bezos.
[02:11:08.486 --> 02:11:08.926]  Bezos.
[02:11:09.007 --> 02:11:10.628]  Because he's the kingpin, folks!
[02:11:11.309 --> 02:11:11.969]  He's the one.
[02:11:14.632 --> 02:11:15.373]  So let me get to this.
[02:11:17.074 --> 02:11:18.676]  He stands in the way of American prosperity.
[02:11:18.696 --> 02:11:19.877]  He stands in the way of the Renaissance.
[02:11:23.317 --> 02:11:27.560]  I heard a lot of this that I got from this other source last night from Stone a year and a half ago and others.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.861]  Then I talked to folks that were at the dinner with Stone.
[02:11:30.561 --> 02:11:32.022]  Wasn't any Russian collusion at this.
[02:11:32.062 --> 02:11:36.044]  It was high-level folks.
[02:11:36.685 --> 02:11:37.725]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:11:37.765 --> 02:11:38.626]  Roger, we haven't talked.
[02:11:39.046 --> 02:11:40.887]  When we come back from break, we'll see what he wants to say.
[02:11:41.307 --> 02:11:47.171]  I just want him to hear what I'm going to say to then correct any of it that's wrong because, again, he's not my new source or this other source.
[02:11:47.211 --> 02:11:48.752]  I have three sources total, but two big ones.
[02:11:49.432 --> 02:11:50.453]  It's that this is big.
[02:11:51.584 --> 02:11:55.408]  And I want to make sure he holds my hand with this and make sure I get it right.
[02:11:55.809 --> 02:11:58.972]  So without further ado, here is the big enchilada.
[02:12:00.974 --> 02:12:10.585]  CNN's a bunch of hired mercenaries and mainly political hacks from the Democratic Party and failed Republicans that get up there and put out their propaganda.
[02:12:14.946 --> 02:12:17.668]  And they're also pushing this narrative that Trump's going to get them killed.
[02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:23.093]  And the word is the globalists are looking to stage terror attacks against CNN, MSNBC to make them the victim.
[02:12:23.113 --> 02:12:32.622]  I mean, that's how desperate they are to try to up the narrative and make themselves pertinent in this whole victimology culture.
[02:12:33.623 --> 02:12:36.846]  But the word is they don't know how to offload CNN.
[02:12:38.356 --> 02:12:49.438]  Because they don't want it to be outside the merger, because then it would fall to a Bezos, Bezos, Tomato Tomato, or a monstrous creature like George Soros.
[02:12:51.179 --> 02:12:55.660]  But it's a sticking point in the merger because AT&T doesn't even want it.
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:00.741]  It's a worthless property losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year that is an eyesore and a ruined brand.
[02:13:01.261 --> 02:13:02.541]  CNN is fake news.
[02:13:04.414 --> 02:13:08.198]  So no need for Trump to take his license or kick it out of the press corps because it's already a joke.
[02:13:08.238 --> 02:13:08.699]  Leave them there.
[02:13:08.919 --> 02:13:09.740]  They're killing themselves.
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:10.420]  They're already dead.
[02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:13.283]  They're like Lazarus though, you know, the reanimated corpses.
[02:13:14.124 --> 02:13:14.945]  They're the walking dead.
[02:13:19.049 --> 02:13:20.631]  So we've got that bottom line there.
[02:13:24.915 --> 02:13:26.277]  So here's the big crux of it.
[02:13:29.449 --> 02:13:31.610]  CNN is like garbage that has to be taken out.
[02:13:32.210 --> 02:13:33.110]  But there's face-saving.
[02:13:33.130 --> 02:13:34.151]  They don't want to just turn it off.
[02:13:34.171 --> 02:13:35.871]  Kind of like when they get rid of Piers Morgan or somebody.
[02:13:35.891 --> 02:13:37.732]  They go, oh, they do a monthly magazine now.
[02:13:38.152 --> 02:13:40.493]  And the monthly magazine airs for three months and then they're just gone.
[02:13:40.513 --> 02:13:46.635]  So they're trying to figure out how to take out the garbage pail at CNN.
[02:13:47.136 --> 02:13:48.836]  And here's what the idiots at CNN don't know.
[02:13:48.856 --> 02:13:50.077]  So I'm going to let them know this.
[02:13:51.557 --> 02:13:58.340]  If they successfully take Trump out, and Trump's now winning, he's turning the corner, the globalists are panicking, they're now trying to sue for peace.
[02:13:59.645 --> 02:14:10.014]  If they remove Trump or a successful CNN, 100% is going to have its doors closed and CNN will be a thing of history.
[02:14:11.395 --> 02:14:19.461]  They're going to save face with some CNN documentary channel that's, you know, 5,000 or something that no one watches that's old interviews.
[02:14:19.702 --> 02:14:20.722]  There's going to be a face-saving.
[02:14:21.123 --> 02:14:26.667]  But it's going to be transferred into some entertainment channel with a whole new name beyond CNN headline news.
[02:14:27.688 --> 02:14:28.309]  That's the test.
[02:14:29.591 --> 02:14:36.975]  So CNN's trying to bring down Trump, but only while Trump was in office did it even bring their ratings up to tolerable, to even halfway fun things.
[02:14:37.275 --> 02:14:56.406]  Without Trump, it's believed that it's going to totally collapse, it'll be totally gone, and the executives believe there's no way to rehabilitate it, and they're unanimous that they want to get rid of it, but they don't want to spin it off to become some new criminal mischief owned by Bezos or the Dark Lord, Nazi collaborator.
[02:14:57.452 --> 02:14:58.092]  George Soros.
[02:14:58.152 --> 02:15:00.854]  So that's what's holding up the whole deal.
[02:15:01.395 --> 02:15:07.779]  Notice they're now debating them excluding DirecTV or something like that because that actually has power and is big.
[02:15:07.839 --> 02:15:08.699]  CNN doesn't matter.
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:20.367]  So there's CNN trying to destroy Trump when CNN is completely bankrupt, propped up like the Washington Post or New York Times, a total failure, absolutely rotten.
[02:15:22.388 --> 02:15:23.969]  Yeah, we declared it dead last year.
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:48.412]  And they lied themselves to death, and so that's what's really going on there, and it just is a symbol of how mainstream media is dead, the legacy media is dead, and that they just don't even know in their own world that if they get rid of Trump, 100%, that CNN will be there for the impeachment, that whatever, and then as soon as that's gone, they are gone.
[02:15:49.012 --> 02:15:49.732]  They are, they are.
[02:15:49.992 --> 02:15:52.654]  So CNN is already dead, but it's trying to fully
[02:15:53.772 --> 02:15:57.033]  Blow the brains out of its own zombie rotting cranium.
[02:15:57.774 --> 02:15:58.414]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:58.434 --> 02:15:59.875]  We'll talk about it with Roger Stone straight ahead.
[02:16:02.016 --> 02:16:04.016]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:16:04.096 --> 02:16:04.437]  Go ahead.
[02:16:04.717 --> 02:16:06.898]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:16:06.918 --> 02:16:09.979]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:16:10.794 --> 02:16:11.875]  It just gets old, man.
[02:16:12.215 --> 02:16:13.937]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:16:14.637 --> 02:16:16.699]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:16:16.959 --> 02:16:20.963]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:16:20.983 --> 02:16:23.465]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:16:24.285 --> 02:16:26.607]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:16:26.968 --> 02:16:28.069]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:16:28.329 --> 02:16:29.210]  Us being shut down?
[02:16:29.450 --> 02:16:30.471]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:16:30.911 --> 02:16:31.952]  You know what, Alex?
[02:16:31.992 --> 02:16:33.072]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:16:33.092 --> 02:16:33.893]  Hey, Frank!
[02:16:34.193 --> 02:16:39.556]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:16:39.857 --> 02:16:44.139]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:47.241]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:47.882]  You understand?
[02:16:47.982 --> 02:16:49.243]  I need your help, Frank!

[02:18:01.494 --> 02:18:02.074]  Alpha Power.
[02:18:02.434 --> 02:18:03.234]  Here's what you want to know.
[02:18:03.474 --> 02:18:09.436]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:18:10.116 --> 02:18:13.656]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:18:14.537 --> 02:18:22.478]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:18:23.018 --> 02:18:26.399]  The average male or female enhancement
[02:18:27.359 --> 02:18:30.541]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:18:30.621 --> 02:18:32.322]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:18:32.683 --> 02:18:37.786]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:18:38.086 --> 02:18:46.391]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:18:46.812 --> 02:18:47.852]  Nobody else does that.
[02:18:47.912 --> 02:18:50.634]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:18:50.994 --> 02:18:53.016]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:18:53.376 --> 02:18:56.458]  The second shipment is now in at Infowarslife.com.
[02:18:56.758 --> 02:18:57.319]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:19:02.099 --> 02:19:02.840]  I'm so excited.
[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:12.446]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:19:13.046 --> 02:19:18.230]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:21.352]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:19:21.552 --> 02:19:30.318]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:19:32.439 --> 02:19:37.220]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[02:19:37.740 --> 02:19:40.501]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[02:19:40.641 --> 02:19:51.524]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:19:52.024 --> 02:19:53.304]  It is amazing.
[02:19:54.705 --> 02:19:59.666]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:20:05.490 --> 02:20:17.558]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.561 --> 02:20:28.565]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:31.033 --> 02:20:33.815]  So, CNN's got both feet in the grave.
[02:20:33.855 --> 02:20:38.719]  It's bankrupt, and it's in the middle of this merger with AT&T and Time Warner.
[02:20:39.179 --> 02:20:53.691]  It's worthless garbage, and I've been told by high-level sources that if they're able to remove Trump, which has actually caused a bounce in their ratings back up a little bit, a dead cat bounce, that they'll definitely be shut down, that the name is garbage, and it cannot be rehabilitated.
[02:20:54.111 --> 02:20:54.771]  But imagine
[02:20:55.592 --> 02:21:04.768]  They've already dug their own grave, they're climbing in it, and now if they take Trump out, which that doesn't look like it's going to happen, Trump's turned the corner, they're being given the shotgun to blow their own head off.
[02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:08.074]  So meanwhile they're being used as a kamikaze.
[02:21:09.206 --> 02:21:09.346]  I think
[02:21:31.514 --> 02:21:39.116]  The average CNN person doesn't even know that they are seen as garbage by all the corporations and they're just figuring out what to do with it.
[02:21:39.836 --> 02:21:45.077]  I just say let a Bezos or let a Soros take it over.
[02:21:45.117 --> 02:21:48.298]  It's already such a joke, but I guess that's why they're still holding on to it.
[02:21:48.578 --> 02:21:50.018]  So you heard my breakdown of that.
[02:21:50.058 --> 02:21:53.139]  How accurate is that with the latest info you've got with your sources?
[02:21:53.658 --> 02:22:03.083]  Well, we know that one of the major sticking points in government approval of the AT&T-Time Warner merger is the status of CNN.
[02:22:03.424 --> 02:22:04.404]  There are two arguments.
[02:22:04.524 --> 02:22:21.674]  One argument is that since it is performing very poorly economically, financially, and since their ratings are relatively anemic, except for when I'm on, they should get new management that would change the whole thing, including the direction.
[02:22:23.166 --> 02:22:27.388]  Alternatively, there are others who say, no, it's garbage, spin it off.
[02:22:28.408 --> 02:22:30.009]  I am in the former camp.
[02:22:30.409 --> 02:22:36.811]  I would have let the management at AT&T, the new owners, make shrewd business decisions.
[02:22:37.391 --> 02:22:44.494]  Spinning it off, which it could put in the hands of Soros or Bezos or some other O's with a lot of money.
[02:22:45.494 --> 02:22:51.176]  And unfortunately, even though the brand name is somewhat damaged,
[02:22:52.056 --> 02:22:56.038]  Nothing helps like a couple hundred million dollars in online promotion.
[02:22:56.138 --> 02:22:59.639]  Oh, they could go to crossfire mode of real debate right now.
[02:22:59.679 --> 02:23:02.080]  They'd be right up to Fox News in six months.
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:03.261]  You could turn it around instantly.
[02:23:03.801 --> 02:23:06.722]  But they made a, they made a, what was a commercial...
[02:23:07.766 --> 02:23:13.631]  Uh, decision that they were going to be the voice, you know, the respectable voice of anti-Trumpism.
[02:23:14.011 --> 02:23:15.713]  They were going to be more sly.
[02:23:16.233 --> 02:23:29.324]  They find their lefty viewers, very few of them, of course, going over to MSNBC where they're completely nuts, as opposed to CNN, which pretends to be objective but tilts way left.
[02:23:31.205 --> 02:23:33.407]  This is going to be a key point.
[02:23:33.847 --> 02:23:42.773]  As you know, they, of course, are quietly pushing to have InfoWars removed from YouTube, removed from the Internet.
[02:23:43.514 --> 02:23:48.177]  You know, journalists leading the way for censorship makes little sense to me.
[02:23:49.258 --> 02:23:50.299]  What about my source?
[02:23:52.313 --> 02:23:56.334]  And again, with similar info that I've talked to you about, but saying, no, it's done.
[02:23:56.394 --> 02:23:57.975]  The executives made the decision.
[02:23:58.075 --> 02:24:00.636]  If the merger happens or not, CNN is gone.
[02:24:00.656 --> 02:24:01.456]  It is garbage.
[02:24:01.516 --> 02:24:03.176]  Unfortunately, it's not up to them.
[02:24:03.276 --> 02:24:10.038]  The government required them in a decision, essentially, as a condition of approval, that they have to spin it off.
[02:24:10.698 --> 02:24:15.780]  I think that that was an error, but that's kind of where this was left off.
[02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:22.686]  But that's what I'm saying, no one wants to buy it, no one wants to buy it, and so what's gonna, I mean from your sources, what's gonna happen?
[02:24:22.706 --> 02:24:37.100]  At that point though, AT&T then challenged that ruling by the government court, a suit that they're likely to win, so in the end the courts will approve the deal, and I think AT&T will still end up owning CNN.
[02:24:37.841 --> 02:24:40.784]  The President's decision being appealed right now in the courts.
[02:24:41.519 --> 02:24:43.161]  And I know you disagree with that decision.
[02:24:43.221 --> 02:24:47.706]  You thought that AT&T should take it over and try to reform it and at least make it, you know, two-sided.
[02:24:47.726 --> 02:24:49.809]  I mean, you were at least a liberal conservative.
[02:24:50.109 --> 02:24:53.273]  They could buy the cameras and everything and change the name if they had to.
[02:24:55.839 --> 02:24:57.581]  So is it accurate what my source said?
[02:24:57.601 --> 02:25:02.587]  Because I know you're tied into the people right at the top when it comes to lobbying without giving away too much.
[02:25:02.607 --> 02:25:12.820]  I mean is it accurate though that they, the corporations see it as garbage and it's not even in the discussion now and they're saying that the only reason it's around is because Trump's even there.
[02:25:13.257 --> 02:25:16.621]  Well, everybody is essentially just sitting around now waiting for the court.
[02:25:16.681 --> 02:25:19.844]  The decision will be made there, so the lobbyists are unengaged.
[02:25:20.345 --> 02:25:30.876]  Everybody, you know, this decision is there to be made, but it's not going to be made through the regulatory process of the executive branches.
[02:25:30.896 --> 02:25:32.558]  It's going to ultimately be made by the courts.
[02:25:33.138 --> 02:25:36.839]  I think on the law, I think AT&T has a strong case.
[02:25:37.359 --> 02:25:42.720]  The government has approved other mergers with these same encumbrances.
[02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:52.041]  Oh, I agree with the merger because these are all a bunch of old legacy moth-eaten garbage compared to Google or Amazon with all its media presence or any of that.
[02:25:52.421 --> 02:25:59.183]  I mean, it's like today there's a major story that Qatar is putting $90 million into Newsmax.
[02:25:59.743 --> 02:26:01.743]  And Newsmax is going to expand into cable.
[02:26:02.449 --> 02:26:03.751]  Cable's yesterday.
[02:26:03.771 --> 02:26:07.837]  Newsmax doesn't have the online presence that InfoWars has.
[02:26:08.137 --> 02:26:09.019]  We reach millions.
[02:26:09.099 --> 02:26:11.582]  They reach a lot of patriots.
[02:26:11.683 --> 02:26:14.126]  By the way, I don't even want to give out our podcast numbers.
[02:26:15.239 --> 02:26:18.360]  Because I had seen some of them, but I started to actually do an accounting around here.
[02:26:19.121 --> 02:26:20.481]  And so I actually did an accounting.
[02:26:21.082 --> 02:26:32.066]  We only have a few million people downloading my show, but on the three different platforms that we have, podcasts just for mine, which we don't even promote, it's seven million a month.
[02:26:32.406 --> 02:26:34.787]  Then you add the other shows, it's another four million.
[02:26:35.107 --> 02:26:37.909]  We're not even promoting podcasts, and that's...
[02:26:39.549 --> 02:26:42.950]  11 million plays just on podcasts.
[02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:44.711]  This is exactly my point.
[02:26:44.771 --> 02:26:54.074]  So, look, I got so tired of this fellow Ari Melber on MSNBC repeating lies over and over again, recycling lies.
[02:26:54.834 --> 02:26:57.915]  His producer and he keep asking me to be on their show.
[02:26:58.395 --> 02:27:04.057]  When I went to tape Andrew Mitchell's show, two of his soy boy producers came down to pitch me.
[02:27:04.997 --> 02:27:07.738]  And, you know, I thought about it and I said, you know, Ari, I have a better idea.
[02:27:08.542 --> 02:27:12.705]  Come on my show, The War Room, one hour, mono a mono, no editing.
[02:27:13.225 --> 02:27:16.107]  We'll get a much, much larger audience than you could get.
[02:27:16.127 --> 02:27:19.169]  And let me knock down your lies one at a time.
[02:27:20.050 --> 02:27:21.111]  I have not heard from him.
[02:27:21.431 --> 02:27:27.075]  Well that's the thing, because they're not even about ratings, they're just about controlling narrative and getting all the media to say the same thing.
[02:27:27.375 --> 02:27:34.080]  But of course if they came on and had a controversial interview, it'd blow up on the internet, they could play it on their show, have ratings, but they're like designed to fail.
[02:27:34.540 --> 02:27:38.883]  It's almost like they want to make the news boring so you tune out and get brainwashed in entertainment.
[02:27:39.203 --> 02:27:43.585]  And that's where the real brainwashing is, Roger, as you know, is going on inside the Hollywood movies.
[02:27:43.645 --> 02:27:46.007]  Man, they are weaponized.
[02:27:46.047 --> 02:27:47.127]  There's no question about it.
[02:27:47.187 --> 02:27:53.011]  They're using the culture and our right to free expression, ironically, in a way against us.
[02:27:53.863 --> 02:28:01.171]  By the way, you know, I like you defending Infowars with Yoram Oklamo and all that, but notice he says, and what Jones said, spearing the families of Sandy Hook.
[02:28:01.491 --> 02:28:07.478]  For years I've said I believed it happened, but I've looked at how people can question because of Gulf of Tonkin and babies and incubators.
[02:28:07.538 --> 02:28:13.625]  But Alex, you have to understand, it's in the Media Matters for America talking points that Chris read that morning, and they go to it.
[02:28:14.212 --> 02:28:14.833]  We edit.
[02:28:15.073 --> 02:28:17.435]  No, I know, but it doesn't even hurt us.
[02:28:18.156 --> 02:28:22.060]  We don't deserve free speech because we hurt blah blah blah.
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:24.563]  Now they say that I say nobody died at Parkland.
[02:28:24.583 --> 02:28:25.684]  That's totally not true.
[02:28:25.964 --> 02:28:29.908]  So I'm just saying, great job, but next time you can just tell them that's edited, that's out of context.
[02:28:30.369 --> 02:28:36.355]  I would have said, well, CNN lied and millions died in Iraq and were fake WMDs, Cuomo.
[02:28:37.139 --> 02:28:52.373]  Well, last night I spoke extensively on Coast to Coast AM about the war of censorship that's being waged against you and I and InfoWars and so many other patriots who are just trying to exercise their First Amendment rights.
[02:28:52.393 --> 02:28:54.815]  George Norrie is an amazing pro-free speech guy.
[02:28:54.955 --> 02:28:57.237]  Thank you so much, Roger Stone, for chiming in on CNN.
[02:28:57.757 --> 02:28:58.538]  Get your voice back.
[02:28:58.578 --> 02:28:59.079]  You're awesome.
[02:28:59.099 --> 02:28:59.699]  Thank you very much.
[02:28:59.719 --> 02:29:00.120]  We'll be back.
[02:29:07.173 --> 02:29:15.941]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[02:29:16.361 --> 02:29:23.728]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:24.048 --> 02:29:26.790]  No longer 5% but now 10% at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:29:46.149 --> 02:29:53.615]  It may be one of our newest products, but it's one of the fastest selling products we've ever had, and you can tell why by reading all those five-star reviews.
[02:29:53.675 --> 02:29:58.439]  That's why we're dropping it by 25% to help you experience it before it goes back out of stock.
[02:29:58.539 --> 02:29:59.180]  As you age,
[02:29:59.500 --> 02:29:59.940]  You all do.
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:04.303]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[02:30:04.323 --> 02:30:05.744]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[02:30:05.945 --> 02:30:09.867]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[02:30:09.887 --> 02:30:11.208]  And again, you look at the studies.
[02:30:11.449 --> 02:30:17.553]  Testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[02:30:18.377 --> 02:30:27.362]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[02:30:27.543 --> 02:30:35.687]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthroplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.
[02:30:35.787 --> 02:30:37.008]  It is Alpha Power.

[02:30:44.993 --> 02:30:46.954]  Go and read the five-star review.
[02:30:46.974 --> 02:30:47.314]  We're good.
[02:31:02.785 --> 02:31:10.007]  Introducing Icarin, a 30-day liver and kidney cleanse, exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:10.487 --> 02:31:19.629]  We have set out with top researchers and developers to bring you the strongest, purest, most potent, documented system for your liver and your kidneys.
[02:31:19.909 --> 02:31:25.030]  There are two different formula blends in one powerful capsule.
[02:31:25.310 --> 02:31:28.151]  It also funds the Infowar, a total 360 win.
[02:31:28.571 --> 02:31:31.192]  Icarin, available now at Infowarslife.com.
[02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:37.132]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[02:31:37.152 --> 02:31:37.452]  Go ahead.
[02:31:37.552 --> 02:31:41.456]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[02:31:41.597 --> 02:31:46.602]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[02:31:47.142 --> 02:31:51.026]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day.
[02:31:51.767 --> 02:32:01.794]  To your full skill that you do and I absolutely thank God that I have a forum that I can contribute to and I get such an amazing product.
[02:32:02.435 --> 02:32:05.337]  We use your brain force, your survival shield.
[02:32:06.017 --> 02:32:09.660]  I work nights, 12-14 hours a night, five days a week.
[02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:16.605]  I use your winter sun, your selenium, the real red pill, your bio PCA, immune wall.
[02:32:16.745 --> 02:32:17.025]  I'm just
[02:32:17.225 --> 02:32:21.389]  Here in California, fighting, trying to survive with the demon rats.
[02:32:21.789 --> 02:32:25.052]  How they're demonizing my state, I just can't stand it anymore.
[02:32:25.072 --> 02:32:30.036]  You have changed my life, InfoWars has changed my family's life.
[02:32:30.556 --> 02:32:36.141]  I bought property in a no-fly zone, no cell phone service, got my own well water.
[02:32:36.201 --> 02:32:40.724]  My mind is so open to everything that's going on, but I need to know what else we can do.
[02:32:41.581 --> 02:32:42.882]  Well, you're on the right track, Desiree.
[02:32:43.062 --> 02:32:48.387]  What you're doing right now is absolutely working, and thank you for calling and sharing that with everyone.
[02:32:48.407 --> 02:32:49.768]  I think she should just share her testimony.
[02:32:49.788 --> 02:32:49.908]  Yeah.
[02:32:50.088 --> 02:32:51.950]  By the way, Desiree, again, thank you for your call.
[02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:52.831]  Absolutely, sweetheart.
[02:32:52.871 --> 02:32:54.552]  We love you and tell your husband we love him.
[02:32:54.572 --> 02:32:55.533]  We really appreciate you.
[02:32:55.613 --> 02:32:56.614]  Keep up the fight.
[02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:58.055]  We need to take California back.
[02:32:58.075 --> 02:32:58.435]  Thank you, Desiree.
[02:32:58.455 --> 02:32:59.556]  We're going to come back and make more calls.
[02:32:59.596 --> 02:33:00.217]  Thank you, sweetheart.
[02:33:06.462 --> 02:33:09.065]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.039 --> 02:33:21.124]  From the Front Lines.
[02:33:21.244 --> 02:33:27.170]  From the Front Lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:27.410 --> 02:33:28.391]  Mother!
[02:33:31.751 --> 02:33:45.596]  So if you wonder why corporate establishment dying or zombie undead media is so anti-free speech trying to shut down InfoWars, it's a very simple reason.
[02:33:46.496 --> 02:33:49.477]  They see us as the lead elephant.
[02:33:50.658 --> 02:33:56.680]  They see us as the first big thing that if they can target that and get that they can shut it all down because they know the numbers.
[02:33:58.510 --> 02:34:17.136]  But it's a very interesting political, sociological equation that I can't even figure out because they are blocking us and shadow banning us and Project Veritas has video of YouTube, Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them.
[02:34:18.416 --> 02:34:22.297]  Google and YouTube are one company, but Google's the parent.
[02:34:22.357 --> 02:34:27.999]  They have people on video of both groups saying, oh, our main enemy's Alex Jones.
[02:34:29.892 --> 02:34:36.238]  And when I get up here on air and I go, hey, I'm the main enemy, I don't say that like, hey, I'm really bragging.
[02:34:36.318 --> 02:34:45.227]  I'm like, I marched into the globalist operation trying to fight them, and I never thought we'd end up being one of the most prominent groups out there.
[02:34:46.868 --> 02:34:52.093]  Newsmax is getting 90 million from a Middle Eastern company and a Middle Eastern royalty.
[02:34:53.049 --> 02:34:53.950]  To launch into cable.
[02:34:54.190 --> 02:34:54.790]  Well, that's fine.
[02:34:54.830 --> 02:34:59.253]  Chris Ruddy's a good guy overall and puts out pro-nationalist, pro-free market stuff.
[02:34:59.273 --> 02:34:59.693]  That's great.
[02:35:00.854 --> 02:35:04.256]  There's a multi-billion dollar self-made Texas family funding.
[02:35:06.177 --> 02:35:07.878]  Ben Shapiro and the Daily Wire.
[02:35:08.078 --> 02:35:13.381]  Oh, Ben Shapiro is a globalist, neocon, snake in the grass.
[02:35:15.603 --> 02:35:17.224]  Who's trying to get in my business?
[02:35:18.945 --> 02:35:19.885]  But, okay, fine.
[02:35:20.125 --> 02:35:20.986]  I'm going to leave him alone.
[02:35:22.776 --> 02:35:23.816]  Pride go before fall.
[02:35:25.297 --> 02:35:30.579]  And every other group is financed by big money except Matt Drudge and Alex Jones.
[02:35:33.640 --> 02:35:38.582]  Michael Savage was self-made publishing books and supplements, but I mean, you know, he's on a big network.
[02:35:40.071 --> 02:35:42.652]  So I'd say he's self-made too, but not as free as we are.
[02:35:43.192 --> 02:35:48.853]  And let me tell you, that's not an exciting feeling to be like, okay, WorldNetDaily's independent, but it's not that big anymore.
[02:35:48.893 --> 02:35:49.533]  I wish it was.
[02:35:50.133 --> 02:35:50.933]  I'm not putting it down.
[02:35:50.973 --> 02:35:51.853]  It deserves your support.
[02:35:51.933 --> 02:35:52.694]  Great work over there.
[02:35:53.994 --> 02:35:58.015]  And InfoWars is big, but under massive censorship and constraint.
[02:35:58.535 --> 02:36:00.095]  But then that's the Streisand effect.
[02:36:00.155 --> 02:36:04.896]  It does cause people to tune in more in different ways and come to our core websites.
[02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:09.077]  So we see our base support increase, but the big super viral stuff,
[02:36:10.609 --> 02:36:11.369]  Not as regular.
[02:36:11.969 --> 02:36:13.470]  Which, I'll let the enemy know.
[02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:15.390]  Yeah, I mean, your attacks have had an effect.
[02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:18.451]  Because the only thing I've got's the truth.
[02:36:20.251 --> 02:36:23.912]  And that England is moving to ban all nationalist speech, all Christian speech.
[02:36:24.032 --> 02:36:28.473]  I mean, I just had a... EU member of parliament on, breaking it down.
[02:36:28.693 --> 02:36:29.633]  This is going on.
[02:36:31.633 --> 02:36:36.474]  And if people don't have an immediacy to this, and realize how serious it is, we're gonna lose everything.
[02:36:36.494 --> 02:36:39.075]  Because folks, if they can take the First Amendment in America,
[02:36:41.260 --> 02:36:41.980]  They can take it all.
[02:36:43.561 --> 02:36:45.981]  So I talk about t-shirts here and there.
[02:36:46.021 --> 02:36:49.342]  I used to really promote them because they're walking billboards for InfoWars.
[02:36:49.943 --> 02:36:51.243]  You meet like-minded people.
[02:36:51.403 --> 02:36:53.544]  You have an effect.
[02:36:54.364 --> 02:36:55.744]  And I call it choose your adventure.
[02:36:55.904 --> 02:36:57.665]  But I really haven't been promoting them for about a year.
[02:36:57.725 --> 02:36:58.085]  I should.
[02:36:59.805 --> 02:37:05.067]  During the election, the Hillary for prison shirts were a big success.
[02:37:06.994 --> 02:37:12.236]  And when the media saw a third of the public at the RNC wearing them, it really flipped them out.
[02:37:12.616 --> 02:37:13.336]  Hillary for prison.
[02:37:13.696 --> 02:37:23.079]  But whether it's a ball cap, or whether it's a t-shirt, or Molon Labe, we've got over a hundred t-shirts, patches, ball caps, sweatshirts, hoodies, you name it.
[02:37:25.479 --> 02:37:30.821]  Women's apparel, gold leaf Molon Labe is one of the women's favorite.
[02:37:32.625 --> 02:37:33.806]  Cut for a woman, more athletic.
[02:37:34.606 --> 02:37:38.148]  You got that classic Big Brother t-shirt that was out of print, we brought back right there on screen.
[02:37:39.489 --> 02:37:42.231]  We've got the yellow, won't tread on me.
[02:37:42.431 --> 02:37:45.373]  When you go there and you get these shirts, it's choose your own adventure.
[02:37:46.974 --> 02:37:50.976]  Remember those books when you were a kid that had like three or four different endings for board games?
[02:37:51.737 --> 02:37:52.317]  They had those too.
[02:37:53.018 --> 02:37:54.599]  I mean, you wear one of these things.
[02:37:55.495 --> 02:37:58.857]  In a Libertarian, Patriot, Conservative area, you're gonna meet a lot of friends.
[02:37:59.237 --> 02:38:01.859]  You might get your piece of pie or coffee bought for you at the diner.
[02:38:01.879 --> 02:38:02.940]  I know what happens to me.
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:05.201]  People don't know who I am in some areas, they do it.
[02:38:06.002 --> 02:38:10.204]  You are in kind of a mainline mall, you'll meet, you know, ten fans to one enemy.
[02:38:10.585 --> 02:38:17.829]  You weren't in a liberal, trendy area like downtown Austin, downtown San Francisco, you might get physically attacked, coffee dumped on your head.
[02:38:18.289 --> 02:38:20.371]  It's choose your own adventure.
[02:38:21.684 --> 02:38:25.926]  Wearing one of these hundred plus shirts at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:38:26.386 --> 02:38:27.827]  There's the first t-shirt we ever put out.
[02:38:28.267 --> 02:38:30.168]  Mass murderers agree gun control works.
[02:38:30.648 --> 02:38:31.929]  Picture Hitler, Stalin and Mao.
[02:38:33.510 --> 02:38:35.571]  On the back it says politicians love disarmed peasants.
[02:38:36.511 --> 02:38:37.272]  They're all there.
[02:38:39.573 --> 02:38:41.634]  There's also limited edition shirts of the month.
[02:38:43.507 --> 02:38:47.228]  But I suggest people choose their own adventure and go get a t-shirt today.
[02:38:47.988 --> 02:38:53.329]  And, yes, when you fund us, then all the crap Soros and the rest of them pull gets defeated.
[02:38:55.329 --> 02:39:09.012]  Everybody else, though, when Trump got elected, because I've talked to them all, to the Daily Caller, to WorldNet Daily, to all of them, their traffic didn't go down that much, but their funding went
[02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:12.402]  Down 50-plus percent.
[02:39:13.122 --> 02:39:18.427]  And so, we're in the middle of a major fight now that we've gotten a beachhead and we're restoring the Republic.
[02:39:18.767 --> 02:39:20.849]  They're counter-offensing right now.
[02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:28.096]  And Infowars is the only operation that continued the audience despite the censorship and continued the Capitol.
[02:39:29.650 --> 02:39:33.371]  But now, a year and a half into it, the capital is slowing.
[02:39:34.171 --> 02:39:36.652]  And I am full in, like I've done before.
[02:39:36.692 --> 02:39:40.993]  When things slow, I start spending whatever reserves we have.
[02:39:41.093 --> 02:39:42.333]  I want to defeat the globalists.
[02:39:42.353 --> 02:39:42.953]  That's my goal.
[02:39:43.493 --> 02:39:49.335]  It's not have the bigger private jet, you know, so I can show off, you know, in Florida or D.C.
[02:39:49.395 --> 02:39:52.836]  or New York and look, I've got a big... You know, I fly coach a lot of the time.
[02:39:53.856 --> 02:39:55.216]  Especially if it's a big, long-distance flight.
[02:39:55.476 --> 02:39:58.057]  I'm not paying $6,000 for first class to Europe or whatever.
[02:40:00.441 --> 02:40:05.731]  I will try to choose a flight, though, that isn't full last minute, and then I'll sit with three seats and, like, lay over sideways.
[02:40:05.791 --> 02:40:08.336]  I've done that quite a... And it's not because I'm even a penny-pitcher.
[02:40:08.416 --> 02:40:10.319]  I just... I need that money for the war!
[02:40:12.435 --> 02:40:14.256]  The media knows how frugal I am in focus.
[02:40:14.276 --> 02:40:15.877]  Well, they go, look, he's got a lot of wristwatches.
[02:40:16.157 --> 02:40:17.979]  Well, yeah, because people know I wear a wristwatch.
[02:40:18.039 --> 02:40:20.180]  I've been given like five the last year.
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:22.562]  I gave two wristwatches away last week.
[02:40:22.602 --> 02:40:25.063]  Tim Ferrugia walks in and says, here's a wristwatch.
[02:40:25.083 --> 02:40:26.044]  You said you liked mine.
[02:40:26.624 --> 02:40:27.205]  I'm like, whatever.
[02:40:27.245 --> 02:40:29.546]  But that's the games they play in the media.
[02:40:29.747 --> 02:40:37.672]  They have like shows on HBO and on Comedy Central going, look, Jones is wearing four different watches.
[02:40:39.898 --> 02:40:41.839]  It's just this game, so you don't fund me.
[02:40:42.099 --> 02:40:46.421]  I'm not Bezos that made $12 billion in one day off insider deals and taxpayer-funded stuff.
[02:40:46.461 --> 02:40:52.865]  Matt Brackett's coming up with analysis for a segment and a half, then we're going to turn the baton over to the folks that are guest hosting.
[02:40:53.165 --> 02:40:54.585]  Anthony Comey always does a great job.
[02:40:54.846 --> 02:40:55.966]  Paul Watson's on with me tomorrow.
[02:40:55.986 --> 02:40:57.127]  He was under the weather Tuesday.
[02:40:57.147 --> 02:40:58.187]  So that's coming up.
[02:40:59.108 --> 02:41:05.411]  But secondarily, plugging, because I didn't really plug good today, we have two of our best-selling items, Ultimate Turmeric Formula bodies.
[02:41:07.583 --> 02:41:08.584]  95% curcumin and level.
[02:41:08.604 --> 02:41:10.086]  Nobody else we found has got that.
[02:41:12.049 --> 02:41:16.056]  400 plus milligrams of turmeric alone in each horse pill.
[02:41:16.076 --> 02:41:21.244]  50% off on that and 50% off on all super blue.
[02:41:23.126 --> 02:41:25.028]  Mouth, teeth, and gum care products.
[02:41:25.068 --> 02:41:25.968]  That's the mouthwash.
[02:41:26.008 --> 02:41:27.650]  It's the immune gargle in three different sizes.
[02:41:27.690 --> 02:41:29.791]  It's the children's and adults super blue.
[02:41:29.811 --> 02:41:31.953]  405 colloidal silver and iodine.
[02:41:32.233 --> 02:41:37.077]  The children's doesn't have the tea tree or the really strong organic peppermint.
[02:41:37.137 --> 02:41:38.198]  It's just too strong for kids.
[02:41:38.538 --> 02:41:39.959]  But it's still a concentrated toothpaste.
[02:41:39.979 --> 02:41:40.880]  People go, man, it's weird.
[02:41:41.680 --> 02:41:43.342]  This tube lasted me three months.
[02:41:43.402 --> 02:41:45.043]  Normal tube of toothpaste lasts a month.
[02:41:45.643 --> 02:41:46.944]  Yeah, it's concentrated.
[02:41:47.365 --> 02:41:48.145]  We don't have fillers.
[02:41:48.205 --> 02:41:50.007]  It's made by the top organic producer in the country.
[02:41:51.363 --> 02:41:52.563]  We talked about who they were.
[02:41:52.623 --> 02:41:54.864]  It wasn't contractually bound, but now they got harassed.
[02:41:54.884 --> 02:42:00.165]  They said, please stop saying that we make your stuff or find another manufacturer.
[02:42:00.645 --> 02:42:02.945]  That's the intimidation that goes on in this country.
[02:42:04.566 --> 02:42:07.606]  So, get your Super Blue or your bodies today.
[02:42:07.646 --> 02:42:14.867]  And also, we're about to end these specials next week because we're getting ready to sell out of the Super Blue products, at least two of them, the adult Super Blue and the mouthwash.
[02:42:15.968 --> 02:42:17.208]  We've got plenty of the children's right now.
[02:42:18.499 --> 02:42:20.500]  For God's sakes, give your children the best toothpaste, folks.
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:22.741]  It really is thousands of five-star reviews.
[02:42:22.841 --> 02:42:30.345]  And then don't forget, we have DNA Force Plus, now stronger, now more PQQ, now more CoQ10, at a lower price.
[02:42:30.425 --> 02:42:32.547]  I signed a big-year contract and bought even more of it.
[02:42:32.967 --> 02:42:36.909]  It is, introductorily, 50% off, out of the gates.
[02:42:37.909 --> 02:42:41.531]  Matt Braggin, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, researcher, frequent InfoWorks host.
[02:42:41.972 --> 02:42:44.293]  He'll join us for two segments on the other side to look
[02:42:44.933 --> 02:42:55.024]  At the war between Israel and Iran that I think's pretty much already kicked off and what's going on beneath the surface because he served in the Middle East and is an expert on Hezbollah.
[02:42:55.404 --> 02:42:58.668]  We'll talk about it all on the other side of the InfoWar.
[02:43:01.923 --> 02:43:02.243]  Guaranteed!
[02:43:03.124 --> 02:43:07.027]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[02:43:07.087 --> 02:43:14.553]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[02:43:14.613 --> 02:43:20.438]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[02:43:23.881 --> 02:43:26.903]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[02:43:27.864 --> 02:43:28.605]  But he didn't give up.
[02:43:29.889 --> 02:43:30.329]  And he won.
[02:43:32.091 --> 02:43:33.492]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[02:43:34.253 --> 02:43:38.336]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[02:43:39.597 --> 02:43:42.960]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death of Colonel Travis.
[02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:44.821]  And they all died.
[02:43:45.061 --> 02:43:46.402]  All 180 plus men.
[02:43:46.883 --> 02:43:51.787]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[02:43:53.388 --> 02:43:57.651]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[02:43:58.912 --> 02:43:59.453]  But I know this.
[02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:22.302]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced, with this country under attack by foreign evil forces hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance, I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[02:44:23.763 --> 02:44:27.426]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[02:44:28.388 --> 02:44:30.569]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes.
[02:44:30.589 --> 02:44:35.930]  It's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants, these globalists.
[02:44:38.331 --> 02:44:49.794]  But that said, just like our information is game-changing, the products that we sell, all of them, are powerful.
[02:44:50.214 --> 02:44:52.755]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there,
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:56.723]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[02:44:57.083 --> 02:44:59.306]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[02:45:00.647 --> 02:45:00.827]  PQQ.
[02:45:00.867 --> 02:45:01.068]  Go Q10.
[02:45:03.302 --> 02:45:11.027]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[02:45:11.428 --> 02:45:13.129]  They sell PQQ in little bottles.
[02:45:13.629 --> 02:45:23.456]  The third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[02:45:25.128 --> 02:45:26.649]  Think about that.
[02:45:26.729 --> 02:45:27.550]  It's $74 right now.
[02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:33.494]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[02:45:34.474 --> 02:45:35.775]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[02:45:35.815 --> 02:45:44.161]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[02:45:44.501 --> 02:45:46.203]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[02:45:47.223 --> 02:45:53.005]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product.
[02:45:53.025 --> 02:45:54.225]  So I've not gambled.
[02:45:54.805 --> 02:45:55.685]  I know you want value.
[02:45:55.725 --> 02:45:57.426]  So we've bought even more of it.
[02:45:58.326 --> 02:46:00.426]  We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it.
[02:46:00.987 --> 02:46:07.488]  And we've got it right now at the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere.
[02:46:08.148 --> 02:46:08.869]  DNA Force.
[02:46:08.949 --> 02:46:10.309]  Go read the five-star reviews.
[02:46:10.449 --> 02:46:11.349]  Thousands of them.
[02:46:11.369 --> 02:46:12.710]  Go see what people said it did for them.
[02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:14.110]  It is dramatic.
[02:46:15.330 --> 02:46:23.096]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[02:46:23.837 --> 02:46:32.323]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[02:46:32.883 --> 02:46:39.508]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at MFullRestore.com or you can call AAA-253-3139.
[02:46:42.316 --> 02:46:47.917]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[02:46:48.137 --> 02:46:48.597]  That's fine.
[02:46:50.038 --> 02:46:51.078]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[02:46:51.498 --> 02:46:52.198]  I'm funded by you.
[02:46:52.418 --> 02:46:53.318]  So thank you all.
[02:46:53.979 --> 02:46:58.960]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:02.220]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[02:47:05.741 --> 02:47:08.362]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.343 --> 02:47:20.490]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:47:21.211 --> 02:47:22.693]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:30.001 --> 02:47:31.582]  All right, Matt Bracken joins us.
[02:47:31.702 --> 02:47:33.924]  Appreciate him coming on today.
[02:47:33.964 --> 02:47:37.807]  I commandeered most of this hour because I got behind on some big announcements.
[02:47:38.468 --> 02:47:39.208]  He understands that.
[02:47:39.889 --> 02:47:41.009]  He was stationed over the Middle East.
[02:47:41.049 --> 02:47:41.970]  Terrorism expert.
[02:47:42.030 --> 02:47:42.951]  You know, he always pooh-poohs.
[02:47:43.051 --> 02:47:44.272]  Oh, I'm no big deal as a Navy SEAL.
[02:47:44.292 --> 02:47:46.213]  They do a lot more today, which I know they have a lot more missions.
[02:47:46.253 --> 02:47:47.995]  But he's an author, a great researcher.
[02:47:48.015 --> 02:47:53.659]  When I found out about him like four years ago, really smart people at the Pentagon who are patriots said, you know who Matt Bracken is?
[02:47:53.739 --> 02:47:55.200]  He really gets what's going on.
[02:47:55.580 --> 02:47:57.282]  Without us giving you a bunch of classified stuff,
[02:47:57.902 --> 02:47:59.382]  Matt doesn't need to know classified stuff.
[02:47:59.442 --> 02:48:01.783]  He really is dialed in from an intuitive level.
[02:48:02.003 --> 02:48:02.743]  You ought to have Matt on.
[02:48:02.763 --> 02:48:03.603]  So now he's a good friend.
[02:48:03.623 --> 02:48:07.604]  I'll invite him soon to come to Austin, Texas and co-host with us here in studio.
[02:48:07.664 --> 02:48:09.324]  Best-selling author of a whole bunch of different books.
[02:48:09.664 --> 02:48:11.864]  The website's Enemies, Foreign and Domestic.
[02:48:12.725 --> 02:48:14.625]  So again, he joins us right now.
[02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:20.246]  Matt, there's so much to get into in the limited time we have in this segment and in one more here.
[02:48:20.266 --> 02:48:25.487]  But obviously, the whole situation kicking off the Middle East, I don't like Iran.
[02:48:26.272 --> 02:48:32.774]  And, but, Trump pulls out of the deal, Israel strikes that base south of Damascus, now tit-for-tat, this could escalate very quickly.
[02:48:33.134 --> 02:48:36.475]  I like the peace deal with North Korea, and I get this is part of peace through strength.
[02:48:37.715 --> 02:48:42.576]  So, I want to reserve judgment, I don't want to just jump on the President because he's been proven right time and time again.
[02:48:42.636 --> 02:48:45.897]  I think he's just pragmatically, like you and others have said,
[02:48:47.782 --> 02:48:50.343]  A house is full of termites, he's going in and tearing out the bad parts.
[02:48:50.363 --> 02:48:53.745]  We can have somebody else come in, a nice finishing carpenter later.
[02:48:54.185 --> 02:48:58.327]  He's proven that he really knows what he's doing, or at least his advisors do.
[02:48:59.148 --> 02:49:03.050]  At the same time though, where this whole thing's drifting doesn't look too good.
[02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:12.995]  I get before Obama did this bad Iran deal that there was already missiles firing back and forth and bombings every week, and so this is just kind of that deal being broken goes back to the same.
[02:49:13.235 --> 02:49:14.336]  So I don't blame Trump for that.
[02:49:16.693 --> 02:49:18.494]  I just don't quite understand it.
[02:49:18.554 --> 02:49:22.317]  So what do you think as an expert on this from your own research?
[02:49:23.437 --> 02:49:40.809]  Well, in the last year there's been a pretty big realignment or actually a really affirming of sort of a new Middle East alignment with Israel and the Sunnis plus the USA versus Iran and Iran's allies.
[02:49:41.690 --> 02:49:50.537]  Now the Saudis and the Gulf states would like to run some gas pipelines from the south right through Syria up to Europe.
[02:49:51.638 --> 02:50:02.487]  And that would directly conflict with what the Iranians want and the Russians, which is a military route straight from Iran to the Mediterranean.
[02:50:02.507 --> 02:50:05.929]  And if you look at a map of Syria, it's like a wedge shape.
[02:50:06.490 --> 02:50:10.113]  And the southern corner of that wedge is right up against the Golan Heights.
[02:50:10.979 --> 02:50:23.269]  So Israel has an existential fear of being encircled by their greatest enemy so that they won't have really any kind of warning time like missiles flying from Iran proper.
[02:50:24.190 --> 02:50:33.657]  They're afraid of being massively attacked by Iranian forces that have massively infiltrated Syria under the cover of this civil war.
[02:50:34.558 --> 02:50:38.341]  Now we're in Syria too, but we only have really a tripwire force
[02:50:38.991 --> 02:50:49.616]  They don't do much action, other than being bait for big air attacks, like when the Russian mercenaries tried to attack some of our allies.
[02:50:50.677 --> 02:50:58.741]  We used our forces as bait and then used gunships and drones to kill a lot of Russian mercenaries.
[02:50:59.441 --> 02:51:03.443]  But we don't have anything like the forces that Iran is putting into Syria.
[02:51:04.184 --> 02:51:06.345]  For Israel, this is an existential threat.
[02:51:06.665 --> 02:51:10.387]  Now, Israel, diplomatically speaking, is a superpower.
[02:51:10.928 --> 02:51:14.670]  They have an immense amount of influence, it is safe to say.
[02:51:15.990 --> 02:51:18.052]  Some would say that they have too much influence.
[02:51:19.752 --> 02:51:22.294]  For example, Pat Buchanan, I have a lot of respect for him.
[02:51:23.174 --> 02:51:25.536]  He wants us to just stay out of the deal completely.
[02:51:26.636 --> 02:51:31.839]  Essentially, if Iran is going to become a regional superpower, it's none of our business.
[02:51:34.085 --> 02:51:35.826]  Huge forces at work right now.
[02:51:36.386 --> 02:51:37.886]  I've been reading up on these strikes.
[02:51:38.127 --> 02:51:49.991]  It's not getting the kind of coverage, maybe it's in the eclipse of the Korea news, but these are the biggest attacks, some are saying since 2011, some are saying the biggest attacks since the Yom Kippur War.
[02:51:50.471 --> 02:51:54.973]  I mean, really big air raids targeting Iranian forces all over Syria.
[02:51:55.653 --> 02:52:01.375]  So this could very well be the first ending of an Iran-Israel war
[02:52:04.196 --> 02:52:12.249]  At a time when Israel thinks America and the Saudis will be solidly on their side, dragged into this war on the side of Israel.
[02:52:12.770 --> 02:52:15.795]  So they're attempting to leverage this historical moment.
[02:52:16.463 --> 02:52:22.925]  To be able to fight Iran with full diplomatic backing of the Saudis and the USA.
[02:52:22.985 --> 02:52:23.405]  That's right.
[02:52:23.625 --> 02:52:25.325]  So here's the headline.
[02:52:25.806 --> 02:52:29.647]  The stars have aligned for an Israeli-Iran war.
[02:52:30.627 --> 02:52:32.687]  Israel knows that Iran is sworn to destroy it.
[02:52:33.608 --> 02:52:36.308]  And that they're only gaining in technological prowess.
[02:52:36.708 --> 02:52:39.969]  And so Israel now believes the time is ripe to move.
[02:52:40.509 --> 02:52:42.310]  So they preemptively, an hour after Trump,
[02:52:43.325 --> 02:52:48.851]  Withdrew from the deal, were obviously green-lighted by the White House, to then hit this missile site.
[02:52:49.311 --> 02:52:52.554]  Iran has taken the bait, and is now being sucked in.
[02:52:52.574 --> 02:52:54.757]  And I told listeners yesterday, and some poo-pooed it,
[02:52:55.879 --> 02:53:10.682]  But the reason you've seen almost no coverage day one and day two, now you're seeing some coverage, of this war heating up is that Trump is now exercising executive power during a civil emergency to direct the media not to cover it.
[02:53:11.002 --> 02:53:17.183]  And that's in all the executive orders that, you know, Obama has the kill switch, all that was put in.
[02:53:17.543 --> 02:53:20.384]  Trump has now inherited all that control, Matt Bracken.
[02:53:21.224 --> 02:53:22.325]  It's impossible.
[02:53:22.385 --> 02:53:23.046]  It's impossible.
[02:53:23.166 --> 02:53:24.106]  One rocket gets covered.
[02:53:24.126 --> 02:53:24.807]  It's the top story.
[02:53:25.087 --> 02:53:26.728]  This is all going on for over a day.
[02:53:26.949 --> 02:53:28.510]  There was only one Fox News story.
[02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:29.891]  Zero on CNN.
[02:53:29.931 --> 02:53:35.875]  Matt, we all know that means that the president through the Pentagon put out its feelers.
[02:53:35.895 --> 02:53:36.296]  What do you think?
[02:53:37.225 --> 02:53:45.369]  And this is an area where false flags and preemptive strikes have been the norm for decades and decades.
[02:53:45.849 --> 02:53:55.313]  Going back to the 1967 war with the Israeli attack on the Liberty, which was sort of like a botched false flag attack, probably, although it's still extremely mysterious.
[02:53:56.574 --> 02:54:02.777]  But then we have the recent probable false flag gas attacks blamed on the Assad regime.
[02:54:04.618 --> 02:54:13.223]  If the Israelis are saying that the Iranians fired into the Golan Heights, I wouldn't necessarily take that at face value.
[02:54:13.883 --> 02:54:18.265]  This is an area rife with false flags and preemptive attacks.
[02:54:18.826 --> 02:54:26.930]  I was about to say, Trump pulled the funding for the White Helmets last week, and even mainline German news and others have confirmed that no chemical attack happened.
[02:54:27.864 --> 02:54:28.805]  Yeah.
[02:54:29.065 --> 02:54:41.134]  I don't know how much time we have in this segment, but I was watching Godfrey Bloom the last hour, and I really wanted to salute that man, and it just makes me very emotional to see him.
[02:54:41.955 --> 02:54:45.817]  He's like a stay-behind in occupied Britannistan.
[02:54:46.658 --> 02:54:54.424]  These are the men that fought in Tobruk and El Aleman and Operation Market Garden D-Day.
[02:54:55.166 --> 02:55:16.063]  And to see them reduced to vassals in their own nation, where it's an act of courage to wave a sword that was issued to him by the British Army, is now an act of defiance to say, in my own home, I will use this to defend myself against an attacker, is now considered anti-social behavior.
[02:55:16.543 --> 02:55:28.692]  And he is essentially daring the British government now to cut off his social media as a, as a, you know, as a social, uh, uh, uh, there's a term for the, a social bad guy law.
[02:55:28.712 --> 02:55:30.954]  I forget the term, Tommy Robbins.
[02:55:30.974 --> 02:55:35.317]  They're now saying, they're now saying six months in jail if you criticize Muslims.
[02:55:36.578 --> 02:55:36.798]  Right.
[02:55:36.898 --> 02:55:43.003]  And any place where Islamic blasphemy laws become enforced, whether it's
[02:55:43.800 --> 02:55:55.372]  By Muslims or by a dimmy country, a state full of quizlings, anytime you see Islamic blasphemy laws enforced, Sharia is coming.
[02:55:55.972 --> 02:56:01.478]  First, they cut off your ability to criticize it, like in Sweden or Germany or Britain.
[02:56:02.282 --> 02:56:10.846]  And then you see out-and-out Islamic schools, you know, with children yelling Allah, Akbar... Oh, they're making kids in England now wear burqas.
[02:56:10.966 --> 02:56:13.447]  And I used to hear people 20 years ago warned about this, how they were crazy.
[02:56:13.928 --> 02:56:14.488]  I didn't get it.
[02:56:14.548 --> 02:56:18.710]  Parliamentary-wise, we've got more than 10, 15 parties in these countries.
[02:56:19.190 --> 02:56:24.793]  If the Muslims are 10, 15 percent, they can then all vote as a group and then take over any election they want.
[02:56:24.833 --> 02:56:26.654]  That's why they've already checkmated most of Europe.
[02:56:27.441 --> 02:56:27.661]  Right.
[02:56:27.741 --> 02:56:34.145]  And especially in urban core cities, which are the critical districts, as we know.
[02:56:35.186 --> 02:56:37.668]  Even going to, for example, French Revolution.
[02:56:37.888 --> 02:56:41.950]  It doesn't matter if 90% of France was against the Jacobins.
[02:56:42.511 --> 02:56:48.574]  Once they control Paris and the main cities, they can then fan out into the countryside with the guillotines.
[02:56:48.695 --> 02:56:50.816]  And that's how they'll extend Sharia.
[02:56:50.936 --> 02:56:55.439]  And just like the Bolsheviks for two years only had Moscow.
[02:56:56.550 --> 02:56:56.770]  Right.
[02:56:56.890 --> 02:57:05.617]  And speaking of the Bolsheviks, when those soldiers came back from World War I with their Mosin-Nagants and their swords, they were disarmed.
[02:57:05.977 --> 02:57:12.442]  And now a British Army veteran, it's an act of defiance to wave a sword on a video.
[02:57:13.363 --> 02:57:14.944]  And I salute his courage.
[02:57:14.964 --> 02:57:15.805]  No, that's a good point.
[02:57:15.845 --> 02:57:18.187]  I mean, just for saying he'll defend himself, that's a hate crime.
[02:57:19.187 --> 02:57:26.492]  Right, and now he's basically thrown the gauntlet down at the nanny state to say, what are you going to do?
[02:57:26.772 --> 02:57:31.036]  Are you going to arrest a British veteran and take away his British army sword?
[02:57:31.536 --> 02:57:32.777]  Is that what you're really going to do?
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:35.581]  It's amazing.
[02:57:36.402 --> 02:57:39.826]  My last novel, of course, it took place, you know, in Ireland and UK.
[02:57:39.886 --> 02:57:47.914]  It's made up of SAS veterans on a counter-jihad mission to rescue girls where their own government won't rescue them.
[02:57:56.914 --> 02:58:05.683]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[02:58:06.103 --> 02:58:13.470]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:58:49.225 --> 02:58:49.685]  We all do.
[02:58:49.926 --> 02:58:54.048]  Your body can lose testosterone at rates of about 1-2% every single year.
[02:58:54.068 --> 02:58:55.469]  Don't want to turn into a soy boy.
[02:58:55.689 --> 02:58:59.612]  That's why we worked hard to make an affordable solution to the greatest problem of age.
[02:58:59.632 --> 02:59:00.953]  And again, you look at the studies.
[02:59:01.173 --> 02:59:07.317]  Testosterone in the West is dropping off rapidly due to a number of different factors, including diet.
[02:59:08.118 --> 02:59:17.101]  But the incredible ingredients in this formula will help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that reduced energy and changing mood that often comes with time and age.
[02:59:17.281 --> 02:59:25.423]  Alpha Power even works synergistically with Supermail Vitality and Anthraplex to help you become a true alpha male and take charge of your energy to defy age.

[02:59:34.726 --> 02:59:36.627]  Go and read the five-star review.
[02:59:36.707 --> 02:59:39.129]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:13.962 --> 03:00:16.164]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:16.625 --> 03:00:21.889]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:22.150 --> 03:00:22.830]  Here's the deal.
[03:00:24.051 --> 03:00:34.921]  They have the public plans, the clergy plan, all that, to openly turn Europe into the Middle East.
[03:00:35.642 --> 03:00:36.563]  And they're doing it.
[03:00:38.226 --> 03:01:01.010]  And so, the one thing I had a blind spot on, and I've been on air 23 years, and I read a lot of geopolitical stuff and knew what I was doing when I got on air, but I'm obviously a lot more informed now, is that I hear all this about global caliphate, turn the Muslims loose, and Hitler had a plan, and Kalergi plan, and all of it, and I just couldn't believe that our own elites would be that suicidal or crazy.
[03:01:01.810 --> 03:01:02.730]  But now it's happening.
[03:01:03.711 --> 03:01:05.471]  So this is the one area that I've been
[03:01:07.345 --> 03:01:09.293]  15 years behind the curve on.
[03:01:09.815 --> 03:01:10.217]  I'll admit it.
[03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:14.221]  Because I just cannot believe how crazy our elites are.
[03:01:14.681 --> 03:01:16.002]  Matt Bracken, can you speak to that?
[03:01:16.542 --> 03:01:33.249]  I mean, why would we take victory and success and technology and everything, and then subserve to some Stone Age, rotten, woman-abusing thing, and then have leftists lecture us how England invented slavery when England ended it, and how horrible America is?
[03:01:33.269 --> 03:01:35.350]  I just, it makes me sick!
[03:01:35.650 --> 03:01:37.331]  I don't even know, it's like a nightmare!
[03:01:37.351 --> 03:01:37.971]  It's a joke!
[03:01:39.822 --> 03:01:50.866]  The socialists and the Islamists, the Mohammedans, they both promote a totalitarian ideology that essentially turns an area into a serfdom.
[03:01:51.547 --> 03:01:53.387]  But it's great for the people on top.
[03:01:53.948 --> 03:02:04.192]  In Venezuela, for example, socialist serfdom, the Morales family, the Hugo Chávez family, excuse me, they became fabulously wealthy.
[03:02:04.232 --> 03:02:07.613]  I think his sister is a billionaire, lives in Florida.
[03:02:08.226 --> 03:02:13.130]  You know, so you can become wealthy by inventing something and creating a new product.
[03:02:13.590 --> 03:02:14.371]  That's difficult.
[03:02:14.411 --> 03:02:15.932]  You have to be smart, hardworking.
[03:02:16.252 --> 03:02:17.874]  Or you just have a communist takeover.
[03:02:18.522 --> 03:02:18.762]  Right.
[03:02:18.862 --> 03:02:22.104]  And so they sell serfdom as Marxism.
[03:02:22.624 --> 03:02:25.965]  And the dumber people are, the easier it is to sell.
[03:02:26.386 --> 03:02:28.847]  You know, we're going to take it from the rich and give it to you.
[03:02:28.927 --> 03:02:29.427]  Yay!
[03:02:29.867 --> 03:02:39.211]  So the more low IQ third-worlders they bring into a country, the better it is for those who want to turn the country into a socialist serfdom.
[03:02:39.751 --> 03:02:40.652]  And it's working.
[03:02:41.052 --> 03:02:46.334]  You know, if I have a moment, the t-shirt promotions really made me think of this.
[03:02:46.394 --> 03:02:47.755]  I've been working on a little essay.
[03:02:48.573 --> 03:02:51.856]  And it's about a new concept I'd like to introduce called skylining.
[03:02:52.437 --> 03:02:56.300]  It's related to being in a coma, a coma in Canary, but it's much more than that.
[03:02:56.320 --> 03:03:02.266]  You know, if you're a hunter or if you're a soldier, skylining is a bad thing.
[03:03:02.326 --> 03:03:08.332]  It means you don't want to walk on the ridge because your outline is visible against the sky, you're an easy target.
[03:03:09.032 --> 03:03:11.395]  But sometimes you have to skyline.
[03:03:11.495 --> 03:03:12.536]  I'll give you an example.
[03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:22.623]  If a firebase has been under attack, been sniped, mortared, rocketed, but it's dying down, a lot of the troops are just hiding in foxholes.
[03:03:22.643 --> 03:03:23.783]  They're staying in the bunker.
[03:03:23.823 --> 03:03:26.504]  They won't come out and do the work that's required.
[03:03:26.804 --> 03:03:28.305]  They won't get back to their mission.
[03:03:29.065 --> 03:03:34.347]  The old Sergeant Major, you know, the old Godfrey Blooms, they have to stand up.
[03:03:35.407 --> 03:03:41.712]  Insight of potential snipers as an example to their troops for to be courageous.
[03:03:42.112 --> 03:03:44.233]  Well wasn't that what the Alamo was?
[03:03:44.273 --> 03:03:52.779]  Because I mean they say that Travis knew he was 80% chance gonna die but he had to make the example of the sacrifice to stir everybody up to have the victory.
[03:03:53.460 --> 03:03:57.963]  But it's it's it's not just an intentional sacrifice what I'm talking about is
[03:03:58.718 --> 03:04:04.962]  It's when you have to convey to your troops that the enemy would like us to just hide.
[03:04:06.763 --> 03:04:19.771]  We have to have faith in our combat patrols and our counter snipers that it is safe, that we can stand up and work by wearing an InfoWars shirt, by tuning into InfoWars, by talking it up.
[03:04:19.791 --> 03:04:20.672]  We get out of the bullying.
[03:04:20.732 --> 03:04:21.993]  You're saying we break the bullying.
[03:04:22.972 --> 03:04:25.073]  Right, because most people are timid.
[03:04:25.794 --> 03:04:27.635]  Most people are sheep.
[03:04:28.675 --> 03:04:29.356]  Hold on, hold on.
[03:04:30.096 --> 03:04:33.278]  We've got another guest host coming up who always does an amazing job.
[03:04:33.598 --> 03:04:35.359]  But he'll be happy for you to finish this point.
[03:04:35.399 --> 03:04:36.059]  This is central.
[03:04:36.080 --> 03:04:37.500]  Look at what you're saying.
[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:39.041]  We have to wear the colors proud.
[03:04:39.081 --> 03:04:41.082]  We have to break the will of the bullies.
[03:04:41.122 --> 03:04:43.184]  We have to get out there and start the offensive.
[03:04:43.204 --> 03:04:45.185]  Because there's a lot of folks that aren't cowards.
[03:04:45.845 --> 03:04:50.354]  But they're not leaders, and they're waiting for somebody to pull the pin on the hand grenade.
[03:04:50.815 --> 03:04:51.517]  And we've got to do it.
[03:04:51.557 --> 03:04:55.885]  We'll be back to break down skylining with our guest, Matt Bracken.
[03:05:07.355 --> 03:05:10.436]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[03:05:10.476 --> 03:05:10.997]  You're on the air.
[03:05:11.017 --> 03:05:12.177]  Thanks for holding.
[03:05:12.197 --> 03:05:13.058]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[03:05:13.238 --> 03:05:13.878]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:14.158 --> 03:05:14.518]  Good, man.
[03:05:14.538 --> 03:05:15.339]  Thank you for calling.
[03:05:15.439 --> 03:05:15.979]  Hey, hey.
[03:05:16.079 --> 03:05:20.501]  I just want to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[03:05:20.721 --> 03:05:27.064]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[03:05:27.084 --> 03:05:28.905]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[03:05:29.005 --> 03:05:35.167]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[03:05:36.428 --> 03:05:37.429]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[03:05:37.489 --> 03:05:41.493]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy and it's totally... People ask, why is it sweet?
[03:05:41.893 --> 03:05:43.575]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[03:05:43.935 --> 03:05:44.696]  And exactly.
[03:05:44.716 --> 03:05:48.960]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[03:05:49.300 --> 03:05:49.560]  Boom!
[03:05:49.700 --> 03:05:52.543]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[03:05:52.603 --> 03:05:53.123]  It's amazing.
[03:05:53.203 --> 03:05:57.427]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up and the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[03:06:03.922 --> 03:06:08.867]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:11.249 --> 03:06:14.672]  You know, we're getting into psychological stuff here, and I don't go off textbooks.
[03:06:14.732 --> 03:06:17.014]  I don't go off all the establishment's terms for things.
[03:06:17.054 --> 03:06:17.715]  Most of it's garbage.
[03:06:17.755 --> 03:06:19.116]  I just go with history in my gut.
[03:06:20.297 --> 03:06:24.642]  And I see people so scared of being attacked by mainstream media, being demonized.
[03:06:25.643 --> 03:06:28.164]  But if you go along with it, it creates total stagnation.
[03:06:28.204 --> 03:06:30.706]  It creates collapse of civilization.
[03:06:31.026 --> 03:06:34.068]  When you're being led by bad people, conformity is not good.
[03:06:34.588 --> 03:06:43.272]  When things are going well, and society's open, and you're unified overall, you still got a few, you know, bad people, but that's their free will, then it's good to conform.
[03:06:43.453 --> 03:06:44.293]  I'm ready to conform.
[03:06:44.353 --> 03:06:45.754]  I want to conform right now.
[03:06:46.567 --> 03:06:49.248]  Believe me, I don't enjoy going around, you know, getting all these fights.
[03:06:49.869 --> 03:06:55.392]  But at a gut level, I do enjoy it at a spiritual level because it's got to be done.
[03:06:55.412 --> 03:07:03.916]  And I remember years ago, I ended up having a few meetings with globalists and high-level folks, some of which I've been able to talk about because they weren't even private meetings.
[03:07:04.336 --> 03:07:07.658]  John Harmon heard one of the meetings with the head of the Kissinger Group trying to get me to join him.
[03:07:12.196 --> 03:07:14.238]  They would always say, don't you get it?
[03:07:15.098 --> 03:07:17.620]  We don't care you're out there, you're just scaring the public for us.
[03:07:18.881 --> 03:07:21.924]  And I thought, well, I don't think the public's a bunch of cowards, at least the people I'm looking for.
[03:07:21.964 --> 03:07:26.748]  I'm telling them how bad this is, because I think if I knew something bad was happening, I'd want to mobilize against it.
[03:07:27.188 --> 03:07:31.111]  Instead of fight or flight, it's just resistance mode.
[03:07:31.752 --> 03:07:37.657]  And so you were getting into skylining, to finish up, Matt Bragg, a former Navy SEAL bestselling author, about instead of
[03:07:38.217 --> 03:07:41.780]  You know, hiding down, and now is the time to be out in the open.
[03:07:41.800 --> 03:07:47.566]  That's what Trump has done, the ultimate skyliner, to say, free market, America, family, free speech.
[03:07:48.046 --> 03:07:53.411]  They try to all demonize it like it's dirty, like it's bad, and throw everything they've got against it.
[03:07:53.431 --> 03:07:55.853]  But people instinctively know it's a fraud.
[03:07:55.873 --> 03:07:59.617]  And now as Trump has success, and everything starts turning around like,
[03:08:00.157 --> 03:08:03.780]  The sun coming up, they are going into total panic mode.
[03:08:03.840 --> 03:08:13.046]  So, finish up with skylining and where you think they're going to strike next, that it becomes apparent their agenda is failing, that Anthony Cumia, the head of Compound Media, is taking over.
[03:08:14.247 --> 03:08:15.788]  Yeah, that's a great point.
[03:08:15.928 --> 03:08:17.889]  Trump is the ultimate skyliner.
[03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:24.154]  He's doing this not only so that he can move the helm, the ship of state's wheel,
[03:08:25.191 --> 03:08:29.814]  But he is actually purposefully putting himself up as a big target.
[03:08:30.234 --> 03:08:32.276]  A strong man saying, don't be afraid.
[03:08:32.676 --> 03:08:36.138]  That's why they're throwing everything, including the kitchen sink, at him.
[03:08:36.618 --> 03:08:41.462]  They know if he succeeds, more will follow, more will rise.
[03:08:41.842 --> 03:08:52.749]  They want to beat him down, impeach him, make him fail, so that no other future billionaire or populist will rise up because they know that all the guns will be aimed at them.
[03:08:53.249 --> 03:08:56.072]  And that's why shows like Infowars are so important.
[03:08:56.492 --> 03:08:59.475]  They're an example that you don't have to sell out to the networks.
[03:09:00.176 --> 03:09:02.879]  You don't have to sell out to some billionaire backers.
[03:09:03.539 --> 03:09:04.861]  You can do it on your own.
[03:09:05.041 --> 03:09:12.268]  And just a suggestion, because I was never a big fan of sticking glue bumper stickers on a nice car.
[03:09:12.949 --> 03:09:14.891]  You can get a magnetic bumper sticker
[03:09:15.763 --> 03:09:16.424]  Same size.
[03:09:16.464 --> 03:09:28.694]  You put your bumper sticker on it, that way you can slap your InfoWars bumper sticker on when you want it, but if you're afraid you're going to some place where your car is going to get vandalized, because that's what they do, you can pull it off.
[03:09:29.154 --> 03:09:42.665]  But I mean, in general... We should put out magnet-based ones where you can be tactical, put it on your car, where a thousand people will see you on a road trip, a hundred going to work, pull it off, slap it on, and then you're tactical.
[03:09:42.685 --> 03:09:43.125]  That's smart.
[03:09:43.886 --> 03:09:45.988]  Yeah, I bought a three-pack.
[03:09:46.008 --> 03:09:55.055]  I just looked on the internet, and I got a three-pack for a couple bucks, and they just are a big black vinyl magnet.
[03:09:55.535 --> 03:10:02.981]  You put any bumper sticker on there, some might cut down, but that way, like you said, you go on a road trip, thousands of people will see your InfoWars.
[03:10:05.143 --> 03:10:06.644]  Forbidden information bumper sticker.
[03:10:06.664 --> 03:10:09.445]  The real victory mindset is none of us are going to do it all alone.
[03:10:09.665 --> 03:10:30.892]  Every little bit, calling into C-SPAN, going and speaking at City Council, going to a Congressional meeting, going to the State House, talking to young people, handing out bumper stickers, supporting a broadcast, all of that moves the ball forward, and it's that will of the people, like Beowulf grabbing Grendel by the arm, that is unstoppable force.
[03:10:31.552 --> 03:10:33.673]  And even on social media,
[03:10:34.395 --> 03:10:34.995]  Retweet!
[03:10:35.175 --> 03:10:39.717]  I constantly see, you know, a hundred likes and four retweets.
[03:10:39.757 --> 03:10:40.777]  Are people afraid?
[03:10:40.797 --> 03:10:50.640]  I mean, if you're too timid to retweet a message today, a conservative nationalist message today... You're not going to fight tomorrow.
[03:10:50.660 --> 03:10:51.961]  You think it's going to be easier later?
[03:10:53.018 --> 03:10:57.442]  Last thing people don't get, because I'm all about guns and I'm all about the Second Amendment, but the first comes first.
[03:10:57.823 --> 03:10:58.884]  It's always, well, the U.N.
[03:10:58.924 --> 03:10:59.624]  comes, I'll kill them.
[03:10:59.644 --> 03:11:00.425]  It won't be the U.N.
[03:11:00.705 --> 03:11:01.366]  It'll be U.N.
[03:11:01.386 --> 03:11:02.247]  brainwashed police.
[03:11:02.647 --> 03:11:07.331]  If you won't fight in the Infowar today, you will not fight when the real time comes.
[03:11:07.392 --> 03:11:08.593]  And we don't want to go there.
[03:11:08.953 --> 03:11:10.214]  And it's not that I'm even afraid of going there.
[03:11:10.254 --> 03:11:11.736]  Man, it'd be a lot easier at an animal level.
[03:11:12.236 --> 03:11:15.919]  I mean, you know, everybody knows killing is like eating or sitting on the toilet.
[03:11:15.939 --> 03:11:17.640]  I mean, it's just like part of a bodily function.
[03:11:18.021 --> 03:11:19.702]  We're trying to do the real intellectual work here.
[03:11:20.102 --> 03:11:24.185]  And that's the one final thing the globalists don't get is they think we're intimidated by them.
[03:11:24.526 --> 03:11:29.029]  We're just scared of once we get violent, the collateral damage and not executing it correctly.
[03:11:29.329 --> 03:11:33.673]  But I think once it goes to the next level, these people are all going to be in deep trouble.
[03:11:35.422 --> 03:11:44.006]  That's right, but unfortunately it might send us into a period of terrible anarchy and destruction that will not help anybody.
[03:11:44.066 --> 03:11:46.547]  But we do need to stop being so polite.
[03:11:46.627 --> 03:11:48.067]  We need to take off the gloves.
[03:11:48.087 --> 03:11:50.428]  That's it.
[03:11:50.649 --> 03:11:55.951]  If we don't get tough and get aggressive in the information war, we're ensuring the physical war.
[03:11:57.023 --> 03:11:58.365]  People need to understand.
[03:11:59.006 --> 03:12:03.991]  Socialists and Islamists both believe in strategic deception.
[03:12:04.372 --> 03:12:05.213]  They lie.
[03:12:06.013 --> 03:12:10.519]  Part of their code is to lie to the non-believers, to the suckers.
[03:12:10.879 --> 03:12:13.822]  So you can't be polite and take them at face value.
[03:12:15.879 --> 03:12:16.159]  Thank you.
[03:12:37.967 --> 03:12:41.791]  Now, joining us is Anthony Comey of compoundmedia.com.
[03:12:41.851 --> 03:12:43.753]  Everybody should go there, check out, subscribe.
[03:12:44.073 --> 03:12:45.014]  The great work he's doing.
[03:12:45.034 --> 03:12:47.036]  He's taking over for the next 45 minutes.
[03:12:47.076 --> 03:12:48.597]  Thanks for letting us jump in there.
[03:12:48.637 --> 03:12:49.458]  I got behind today.
[03:12:49.478 --> 03:12:50.719]  Good to see you back from vacation.
[03:12:51.220 --> 03:12:55.724]  All rested up, but I think that's what he's saying is we now know they're authoritarian.
[03:12:55.764 --> 03:12:56.745]  They're not backing down.
[03:12:57.185 --> 03:13:01.730]  You have the number one show on XM, number one, you know, on the morning a commercial radio got kicked off.
[03:13:02.450 --> 03:13:03.771]  Every time, because you're more libertarian.
[03:13:04.111 --> 03:13:04.991]  You've already been through it.
[03:13:05.051 --> 03:13:06.612]  We're now back against the wall.
[03:13:06.972 --> 03:13:07.912]  We don't have a choice.
[03:13:07.932 --> 03:13:09.293]  I'm gonna let you take over.
[03:13:09.393 --> 03:13:10.073]  Thanks for coming in.
[03:13:10.093 --> 03:13:11.614]  Compoundmedia.com, Anthony Cumia.
[03:13:11.914 --> 03:13:12.714]  Thank you so much, my friend.
[03:13:13.574 --> 03:13:14.675]  Alex, absolutely.
[03:13:15.455 --> 03:13:16.536]  I was just listening to that.
[03:13:17.036 --> 03:13:18.276]  Amazing stuff.
[03:13:18.476 --> 03:13:21.697]  And when you think about... I watch a lot of war documentaries.
[03:13:21.758 --> 03:13:23.618]  And don't be mistaken, we're at war right now.
[03:13:24.198 --> 03:13:28.020]  I watch a lot of war documentaries, and you'll see, when a platoon is pinned down,
[03:13:28.914 --> 03:13:30.375]  They need inspiration.
[03:13:30.575 --> 03:13:42.020]  One guy will stand up and charge forward, and these other people, without even thinking, get up and move and start charging forward with this guy.
[03:13:42.300 --> 03:13:47.303]  We need more people to show, hey, look, there's a light at the end of this tunnel.
[03:13:47.803 --> 03:13:49.584]  There's a crack in the armor.
[03:13:50.004 --> 03:13:54.066]  It's time to stand up, move, not be afraid anymore.
[03:13:54.346 --> 03:13:56.347]  People are petrified of being called things.
[03:13:57.324 --> 03:14:07.449]  They're being petrified of losing their jobs and their reputations and relationships because you're called some type of ist or phobe.
[03:14:07.849 --> 03:14:09.670]  No, get out there on social media.
[03:14:11.391 --> 03:14:11.931]  Use your name.
[03:14:12.031 --> 03:14:12.712]  Be brave.
[03:14:13.052 --> 03:14:13.892]  We have to be.
[03:14:14.213 --> 03:14:15.813]  We're pushing back finally.
[03:14:16.113 --> 03:14:19.275]  We're finally pushing back and seeing the result of this.
[03:14:19.615 --> 03:14:21.976]  They're losing their minds.
[03:14:22.517 --> 03:14:24.278]  And I couldn't be happier.
[03:14:24.498 --> 03:14:26.839]  But we do need more people that are going to
[03:14:27.319 --> 03:14:35.272]  Look at others taking that lead and follow suit and get in there and mix it up and debate.
[03:14:36.182 --> 03:14:40.623]  And show that a lot of what they're getting from mainstream media are blatant lies.
[03:14:40.643 --> 03:14:41.144]  Exactly.
[03:14:41.184 --> 03:14:46.805]  Do we really want to live on our knees to a bunch of bullies that are always going to want more, more, more, more, more, more?
[03:14:47.226 --> 03:14:47.486]  No.
[03:14:47.946 --> 03:14:49.786]  The danger is giving in to these people.
[03:14:50.046 --> 03:14:54.088]  The safe way, we're not just looking to fight here, but we instinctive levels.
[03:14:54.148 --> 03:14:57.209]  Why do you and I instinctively get it as you go to break that we got to fight?
[03:14:57.509 --> 03:14:58.789]  Why do other people not get this?
[03:14:58.829 --> 03:14:59.849]  This is so obvious.
[03:15:00.130 --> 03:15:01.450]  America is all about fighting.
[03:15:02.777 --> 03:15:03.778]  Isn't it obvious?
[03:15:03.818 --> 03:15:15.608]  Like, I'm dumbfounded at times where I'm like, how could you look at what we've seen from mainstream media, Hollywood, Washington, and not just know it's utter and complete crap?
[03:15:15.868 --> 03:15:18.971]  And we've been fed it for decades upon decades.
[03:15:19.351 --> 03:15:22.374]  Finally the covers come off and some people are still
[03:15:22.974 --> 03:15:24.475]  Absolutely blind to it.
[03:15:25.435 --> 03:15:26.916]  It's beyond me.
[03:15:27.056 --> 03:15:30.958]  I don't know what you have to do to open some of these people's eyes.
[03:15:31.158 --> 03:15:32.498]  But they are being open.
[03:15:32.798 --> 03:15:42.322]  And I do see a lot of people are getting educated as to the mainstream media and how they've been... I totally agree.
[03:15:42.342 --> 03:15:45.244]  And even though I disagree with Trump on a few things, it's so beautiful what he's doing.
[03:15:45.264 --> 03:15:45.844]  I just love the guy.
[03:15:46.224 --> 03:15:48.429]  Anthony Cumia takes over on the other side of this quick break.
[03:15:48.709 --> 03:15:51.013]  ComHowManyYou.com, AlexJonesInfoWars.com.
[03:15:51.314 --> 03:15:55.803]  And coming up in 45 minutes, The War Room with Owen Schroyer, Roger Stone, and so much more.
[03:15:56.284 --> 03:15:56.785]  Stay with us.
[03:16:04.861 --> 03:16:07.362]  And Nigel Farage joins us for the next 10 minutes.
[03:16:07.462 --> 03:16:10.504]  You can follow him at Twitter, Nigel underscore Farage.
[03:16:10.584 --> 03:16:12.865]  He's helped lead the populist movement.
[03:16:13.465 --> 03:16:14.946]  What is the latest from the UK?
[03:16:15.066 --> 03:16:23.611]  Look, remember that in 2013, it was in fact British public opinion that shifted our politicians, that stopped us getting involved in Syria.
[03:16:23.631 --> 03:16:27.813]  And don't forget, the object of the government at the time was to arm the rebels.
[03:16:27.873 --> 03:16:30.754]  Alex, if we'd done that, we'd have armed ISIS.
[03:16:30.834 --> 03:16:32.175]  It would have been mad!
[03:16:32.775 --> 03:16:40.479]  And actually, it was British public opinion affecting our politicians that stopped Obama and America from getting involved in this.
[03:16:40.519 --> 03:16:42.920]  So, I'm a great believer actually with all these things.
[03:16:43.480 --> 03:16:45.221]  Trust Middle England.
[03:16:45.641 --> 03:16:47.102]  Trust Middle America.
[03:16:47.122 --> 03:16:50.903]  They tend to get it right more than London or Washington DC.
[03:16:51.223 --> 03:16:55.125]  Now, Mrs May does appear keen to get involved militarily.
[03:16:55.666 --> 03:16:56.546]  All I can tell her
[03:16:57.306 --> 03:17:05.914]  is be careful because public opinion now against intervention is probably even stronger than it was four years ago.
[03:17:05.934 --> 03:17:07.015]  Let's put it like this.
[03:17:07.536 --> 03:17:16.404]  If it wasn't Assad that did it, you know, you can make arguments about the deep state doing it, but equally don't forget that ISIS themselves a couple of years ago
[03:17:16.884 --> 03:17:22.205]  We're on record for using chemical weapons no fewer than 52 times.
[03:17:22.665 --> 03:17:35.508]  ISIS could quite easily have done this, hoping the world would blame Assad and the Russians, particularly in the wake of the arguments that are still going on about the poisonings that took place in Salisbury, England.
[03:17:35.548 --> 03:17:37.688]  So, the answer is, we don't know.
[03:17:37.828 --> 03:17:38.928]  You're a leading expert on this.
[03:17:39.028 --> 03:17:40.889]  Why is the left allied with radical Islam?
[03:17:41.149 --> 03:17:42.069]  Why are they trying to fly?
[03:17:43.154 --> 03:17:44.294]  Because they hate Christianity.
[03:17:44.935 --> 03:17:55.918]  They can't, I mean, you know, they deny absolutely our Judeo-Christian culture, which if you think about it actually are the roots completely of our nations and our civilization.
[03:17:55.958 --> 03:17:56.779]  They deny that.
[03:17:57.219 --> 03:18:00.880]  They also, don't forget Alex, they want to abolish the nation state.
[03:18:00.940 --> 03:18:02.140]  They want to get rid of it.
[03:18:02.621 --> 03:18:10.563]  They want to replace it with the globalist project and the European Union is the prototype for the new world order.
[03:18:10.903 --> 03:18:12.644]  Do you know, if Hillary had won that election,
[03:18:13.377 --> 03:18:18.578]  Last year, she was going to sign America up to get really close to this kind of thing.
[03:18:18.618 --> 03:18:24.640]  So, you know, we may sit here right now, Alex, and be a bit critical of Trump, but on many other things, he's got things right.
[03:18:24.940 --> 03:18:33.102]  And when you send a message, when Angela Merkel sends a message, as many of you as want to come can come, what do you think they're going to do?
[03:18:33.122 --> 03:18:38.983]  In fact, the liberals have become the very fascists that they try and criticise with their rhetoric.
[03:18:39.023 --> 03:18:40.203]  And look, what's really happening here?
[03:18:40.703 --> 03:18:42.524]  You know, don't underestimate
[03:18:43.124 --> 03:18:46.088]  How massive the seismic shock of 2016 was.
[03:18:46.408 --> 03:18:47.489]  The victory of Brexit.
[03:18:47.770 --> 03:18:48.691]  The victory of Trump.
[03:18:49.311 --> 03:18:50.152]  You know, we're winning.
[03:18:50.493 --> 03:18:51.574]  Look at Hungary the other day.
[03:18:51.814 --> 03:18:59.423]  We are winning, but it doesn't feel like we're winning because the left and the state are fighting back with all their might.
[03:18:59.523 --> 03:19:00.324]  And you know something?
[03:19:00.865 --> 03:19:01.666]  If we can resist,
[03:19:02.461 --> 03:19:11.567]  This politically correct charge, this attempt to stop us thinking and speaking freely, if we can resist that, then our victory actually will be complete.
[03:19:11.607 --> 03:19:13.348]  So don't get down, everybody.
[03:19:13.628 --> 03:19:14.489]  Don't get depressed.
[03:19:14.829 --> 03:19:17.331]  They're behaving like this because we're beating them.
[03:19:18.154 --> 03:19:27.063]  And let's remember, you're the guy when Trump thought three months before he was going to lose that came in privately, cheered him up and cheered up the troops, and you were a critical catalyst in this, just as you were in Brexit.
[03:19:27.324 --> 03:19:27.984]  You're amazing.
[03:19:28.225 --> 03:19:28.905]  Thank you for joining us.
[03:19:28.965 --> 03:19:31.708]  I know you're very busy, but that's as the EU has said.
[03:19:31.768 --> 03:19:34.251]  They'll try to start a wider war to keep the EU.
[03:19:34.271 --> 03:19:37.655]  Don't you think that's what part of this attempt to start World War III is about in Syria?
[03:19:38.895 --> 03:19:51.559]  I think the globalists have wanted to have some form of conflict with Russia as an argument for us all to surrender our national sovereignty and give it up to a higher global level.
[03:19:51.919 --> 03:19:57.400]  They've wanted it for years and now they see their opportunity and we must retain it.
[03:19:57.880 --> 03:19:59.201]  Thank you so much Nigel Farage.
[03:20:05.683 --> 03:20:09.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.892 --> 03:20:22.774]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:20:23.255 --> 03:20:27.157]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:27.638 --> 03:20:30.920]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:20:32.987 --> 03:20:38.211]  High quality nascent iodine survival shield X2 at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:38.491 --> 03:20:46.117]  We found out recently we may have difficult time sourcing the powerful ingredient in survival shield X2, which can make the supply limited.
[03:20:46.698 --> 03:20:54.463]  Derived from ancient sea salts deep beneath the surface, our popular X2 formula is the evolution of our original survival shield supplement.
[03:20:54.784 --> 03:20:58.827]  Manufactured in a state licensed facility and taking advantage of powerful ingredients
[03:20:59.307 --> 03:21:07.393]  The InfoWars team worked day and night to bring you the most powerful and affordable nascent iodine formula around to help keep your body healthy and strong.
[03:21:07.713 --> 03:21:16.159]  With iodine deficiency seen as one of the biggest public health problems, now's the time to take care of your body with Survival Shield X2.
[03:21:16.879 --> 03:21:17.460]  Yes!
[03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:19.561]  Where to begin?
[03:21:20.142 --> 03:21:24.445]  People, welcome Anthony Cumia in here at InfoWars.com.
[03:21:25.425 --> 03:21:27.387]  And, uh, oh my God, I...
[03:21:28.514 --> 03:21:30.096]  I'm not tired of winning yet.
[03:21:30.316 --> 03:21:31.197]  I gotta be honest.
[03:21:31.637 --> 03:21:35.681]  My winning threshold, pretty damn high.
[03:21:36.542 --> 03:21:43.089]  And as you remember, Donald Trump, during his campaign, said you're gonna get tired of winning.
[03:21:44.170 --> 03:21:44.911]  I'm not there yet.
[03:21:45.291 --> 03:21:46.132]  I'll tell you who is.
[03:21:47.373 --> 03:21:48.534]  Everyone on the left.
[03:21:48.955 --> 03:21:50.136]  Oh my God!
[03:21:50.942 --> 03:21:54.725]  It is, I gotta tell you, it's so fun.
[03:21:55.165 --> 03:22:02.491]  Sometimes if you're watching a sporting event or whatnot, you might start feeling sorry for the opposing team.
[03:22:03.011 --> 03:22:05.714]  If they're just getting blown out, your team just looks awesome.
[03:22:05.734 --> 03:22:10.998]  You just start, you lay off on the taunts.
[03:22:11.358 --> 03:22:14.340]  You're not looking at them crying and feeling good about it anymore.
[03:22:15.401 --> 03:22:16.142]  Not with this!
[03:22:16.802 --> 03:22:17.903]  I gotta be honest with you.
[03:22:18.970 --> 03:22:41.862]  Last night, I stayed up, about 12 hours ago now, I stayed up and watched the three hostages, yes hostages, being returned from North Korea to Joint Base Andrews, joined by the President, the First Lady, Pence, his wife, and our new Secretary of State.
[03:22:43.303 --> 03:22:45.764]  It was an amazing thing to behold!
[03:22:47.594 --> 03:22:49.795]  Was it over the top?
[03:22:49.955 --> 03:22:57.401]  Was it purposefully put on television and the president had to be there?
[03:22:57.881 --> 03:22:58.381]  Of course!
[03:22:59.022 --> 03:23:06.247]  He did something amazing that no one expected could be done, especially in such a short period of time.
[03:23:06.687 --> 03:23:13.012]  And with all the negative press that this president gets, no matter what he does, good for him.
[03:23:13.632 --> 03:23:15.574]  Good for him that he had the cameras there.
[03:23:16.869 --> 03:23:18.570]  And the flag and the planes.
[03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:22.192]  It was an amazing moment, as well it should be.
[03:23:23.552 --> 03:23:28.775]  So, I go on Twitter, and I really do have a solid choice.
[03:23:29.375 --> 03:23:33.537]  I could go on Twitter, or I could bang my head against a wall.
[03:23:35.018 --> 03:23:40.801]  And for some reason, I pick the more painful of the two, going on Twitter.
[03:23:41.688 --> 03:23:44.411]  I should really just bang my head against a brick wall.
[03:23:44.991 --> 03:23:54.979]  So I'm on Twitter and I'm like, alright, the president has really done some amazing stuff as of yet with his presidency.
[03:23:56.100 --> 03:24:00.624]  This being the latest thing, bringing hostages back to America.
[03:24:02.826 --> 03:24:04.567]  So I'm looking at Twitter and thinking, alright,
[03:24:05.183 --> 03:24:10.304]  The tax cuts, you know, you got some people that aren't going to like that for some bizarre reason.
[03:24:11.365 --> 03:24:20.767]  The record lows, especially in some of our minority demographics here in this country, of unemployment over the years, the GDP.
[03:24:22.408 --> 03:24:29.590]  It's just, there's a cavalcade of things that this president has done for the good of the country.
[03:24:31.571 --> 03:24:34.072]  And you'll always get fights on Twitter, always.
[03:24:34.632 --> 03:24:44.155]  So I'm thinking, last night, as I said, I'm watching it live and going, there's nothing, nothing anyone can say bad about this!
[03:24:47.095 --> 03:24:48.416]  Of course there is.
[03:24:49.196 --> 03:24:50.696]  Of course there is!
[03:24:51.537 --> 03:24:54.697]  Because Donald Trump was behind it.
[03:24:56.038 --> 03:24:59.959]  It really does, it is an amazing litmus test
[03:25:00.976 --> 03:25:08.099]  As to how far the progressive left will go to try to discredit this president.
[03:25:09.260 --> 03:25:22.266]  He brings three Americans who were imprisoned in what could possibly be the most totalitarian run country on the face of the earth.
[03:25:23.387 --> 03:25:29.129]  Known for torture and murder of prisoners as
[03:25:31.545 --> 03:25:41.349]  We saw at the last, what's his name, the poor little kid, Owen, that was murdered by the North Koreans.
[03:25:44.571 --> 03:25:47.372]  And they still have crap to say about it.
[03:25:47.912 --> 03:25:50.433]  They can't give him anything.
[03:25:50.954 --> 03:25:51.714]  Not an inch.
[03:25:53.155 --> 03:26:00.898]  So we heard, oh, well, he's just buying, yeah, Otto, I'm sorry, Otto Warmbier, Owen.
[03:26:01.718 --> 03:26:03.760]  I'm terrible with names.
[03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:09.724]  And they're saying he bought into the North Korean propaganda machine.
[03:26:10.444 --> 03:26:11.245]  Oh my God!
[03:26:11.845 --> 03:26:27.156]  They actually, some people that I was reading and watching interviews on news, on mainstream media, amazing, and you'd hear things like, he's giving away a position before getting to the bargaining table.
[03:26:28.117 --> 03:26:28.878]  How is
[03:26:29.972 --> 03:26:34.135]  Getting hostages back, giving away anything.
[03:26:36.777 --> 03:26:43.302]  North Korea literally handed over three prisoners that we never expected to see again.
[03:26:44.543 --> 03:26:55.472]  And somehow, that's Trump screwing up these future negotiations we're going to see in early June in Singapore when Trump meets with Kim Jong-un face to face.
[03:26:57.133 --> 03:26:58.034]  And somehow,
[03:26:58.908 --> 03:27:02.290]  They've twisted this around to make it a bad thing.
[03:27:02.930 --> 03:27:05.451]  And like I said, it is the litmus test.
[03:27:05.751 --> 03:27:10.153]  You have to look at that and say to yourself, what's the motivation here?
[03:27:11.414 --> 03:27:21.218]  I read, I watch his opponents on television, and you have to wonder, why?
[03:27:22.138 --> 03:27:24.659]  Why on earth would they criticize this?
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:25.960]  Well, because
[03:27:27.592 --> 03:27:30.194]  Their queen didn't win the election.
[03:27:30.734 --> 03:27:31.174]  He did.
[03:27:31.574 --> 03:27:32.515]  Donald Trump did.
[03:27:33.355 --> 03:27:35.776]  And they are livid about it.
[03:27:36.576 --> 03:27:43.840]  And anything this guy does, they will deem poisonous to our nation and its people.
[03:27:45.981 --> 03:27:47.601]  It was amazing to watch.
[03:27:48.802 --> 03:27:52.984]  Another thing that's amazing is this guy's energy is second to none.
[03:27:53.984 --> 03:27:54.485]  Guy's in his 70s.
[03:27:56.070 --> 03:27:58.611]  He's up at 3 a.m.
[03:27:59.251 --> 03:28:03.092]  He's on a plane with these gentlemen that were released.
[03:28:04.112 --> 03:28:09.313]  And then tonight, I believe at like 7 p.m., he's got a rally.
[03:28:09.673 --> 03:28:11.854]  He's going to another campaign rally.
[03:28:12.774 --> 03:28:15.635]  This guy, I don't want to get out of bed.
[03:28:16.595 --> 03:28:19.155]  I don't even want to get out of bed on a daily basis.
[03:28:19.495 --> 03:28:21.776]  And this guy's winging all over the place.
[03:28:23.046 --> 03:28:26.529]  And doing what a president should be doing.
[03:28:26.949 --> 03:28:29.892]  He's transparent, he's out there, he's doing for America.
[03:28:30.412 --> 03:28:32.914]  And again, the left just will not...
[03:28:33.730 --> 03:28:35.370]  Never give him an ounce of credit.
[03:28:35.610 --> 03:28:41.912]  So don't look for it, don't expect it, and don't base your opinion on what the president's doing on what the left is saying.
[03:28:42.072 --> 03:28:44.792]  They will never give this guy the time of day.
[03:28:45.112 --> 03:28:47.293]  We'll be back in a matter of moments.
[03:28:47.573 --> 03:28:50.453]  Anthony Cumia in at Infowars.com.
[03:28:50.513 --> 03:28:52.754]  I gotta obviously thank Alex Jones.
[03:28:53.034 --> 03:28:53.454]  Been a while.
[03:28:53.494 --> 03:28:56.274]  I was on vacation, but I'm back and enjoying the hell out of it.
[03:28:56.754 --> 03:28:57.715]  I'll see you in a couple of minutes.
[03:28:57.755 --> 03:28:58.415]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:58.435 --> 03:28:59.315]  Infowars.com.
[03:29:03.300 --> 03:29:04.281]  Hi, I'm Millie Weaver.
[03:29:05.242 --> 03:29:23.783]  I'm a reporter for InfoWars and the reason I brought this microphone up here to show you guys is there have been so many times that I've been accosted, spit at, had urine thrown on me by rogue people, especially Antifa groups, radical communist leftist groups.
[03:29:24.324 --> 03:29:31.267]  Because of the lies and propaganda that the mainstream media spews about InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[03:29:31.527 --> 03:29:33.908]  So I get attacked because of these lies.
[03:29:34.088 --> 03:29:34.948]  Physically attacked.
[03:29:35.348 --> 03:29:42.711]  Now, a lot of this lawsuit that's been put against Alex Jones and InfoWars surrounds Charlottesville.
[03:29:43.111 --> 03:29:44.752]  I was there in Charlottesville.
[03:29:45.212 --> 03:29:49.654]  I was the InfoWars reporter on the ground reporting to you guys what happened.
[03:29:50.054 --> 03:30:06.762]  We all know that the mainstream media afterward decided to spin a biased, one-sided storyline that you had a bunch of rogue KKK extremists come and attack a bunch of peaceful protesters out there.
[03:30:07.222 --> 03:30:16.147]  What I can tell you is that because I had the ability to livestream and to broadcast on social media, which those broadcasts went viral,
[03:30:16.687 --> 03:30:21.352]  I was able to show what exactly actually happened out there in Charlottesville.
[03:30:21.652 --> 03:30:35.305]  There was violence on both sides, but I will say the overwhelming majority of the violence was coming from the Antifa leftist anti-protesters, the ones protesting people
[03:30:35.825 --> 03:30:38.907]  Who were out there trying to stand up for protecting a statue.
[03:30:39.207 --> 03:30:42.049]  And yes, there were rogue elements on both sides.
[03:30:42.409 --> 03:30:52.776]  But one side came with pepper spray, tear gas canisters, ice chests full of water balloons with chemicals and urine and feces in them to throw.
[03:30:53.116 --> 03:30:56.879]  And that was depicted and caught through my ability.
[03:30:57.199 --> 03:31:04.084]  To live stream, broadcast on Facebook, on YouTube, on these social media sites that they want to remove us from.
[03:31:04.304 --> 03:31:06.565]  I got the truth out there with Charlotte's film.
[03:31:07.306 --> 03:31:14.571]  While at the same time, myself and my cameraman especially were pepper sprayed in the face for being InfoWars.
[03:31:14.971 --> 03:31:20.475]  I made it clear to both Antifa and some of the radical elements on the
[03:31:21.195 --> 03:31:25.679]  Alternative right side that we did not agree with any of their positions.
[03:31:25.919 --> 03:31:29.662]  But what I told them was, I do agree with your right to free speech.
[03:31:30.182 --> 03:31:34.045]  Both of you guys have a right to be out here and peacefully protest.
[03:31:34.425 --> 03:31:42.031]  That didn't stop us from being pepper sprayed and attacked because of the lies and the propaganda that the mainstream media spreads about us and InfoWars.
[03:31:42.391 --> 03:31:47.936]  That's why it's so important that we protect free press, guerrilla journalists,
[03:31:48.596 --> 03:32:00.772]  All of us out here today who are in this room should understand and know the importance of our ability to go out there and tell the truth when sometimes the moral integrity of mainstream media is lapsed.
[03:32:02.197 --> 03:32:11.487]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:32:12.328 --> 03:32:18.594]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:32:20.356 --> 03:32:26.699]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[03:32:27.519 --> 03:32:32.762]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:32:33.362 --> 03:32:45.508]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[03:32:46.048 --> 03:32:48.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:21.589 --> 03:33:28.171]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.631 --> 03:33:32.053]  And now, your host, Anthony Cumia.
[03:33:33.193 --> 03:33:37.635]  Hello, welcome back, InfoWars.com, Anthony Cumia.
[03:33:38.095 --> 03:33:45.938]  And right before that break, we were talking about mainstream media and the liberal left mainstream media.
[03:33:46.756 --> 03:33:50.761]  Uh, and how they will not give Donald Trump the time of day when it comes to giving him a good story.
[03:33:51.062 --> 03:33:54.205]  I heard yesterday that the, um, there is some hope.
[03:33:54.706 --> 03:34:01.735]  The negative reporting rate on mainstream media about our president went from 91% negative stories to 90% negative stories, so...
[03:34:05.979 --> 03:34:06.479]  Good job.
[03:34:06.880 --> 03:34:07.340]  Good job.
[03:34:07.820 --> 03:34:08.501]  We're getting there.
[03:34:08.761 --> 03:34:09.361]  We're getting there.
[03:34:10.562 --> 03:34:11.522]  Can you imagine?
[03:34:12.083 --> 03:34:14.204]  I mean, on a daily basis, look what the guy's doing.
[03:34:14.224 --> 03:34:21.369]  I'm not talking about things he said during the campaign that people were offended by, or his tweeting.
[03:34:22.149 --> 03:34:27.772]  People twisted around everything this guy said to suit their agenda.
[03:34:28.873 --> 03:34:33.276]  I'm talking about things, substantial things, that this president's done.
[03:34:33.906 --> 03:34:35.327]  As far as taxes go.
[03:34:36.028 --> 03:34:38.530]  And helping out America.
[03:34:39.531 --> 03:34:43.995]  Getting our world view back up there again.
[03:34:44.176 --> 03:34:45.357]  Our foreign policy.
[03:34:46.378 --> 03:34:48.820]  Obama was the apology president.
[03:34:49.260 --> 03:34:57.268]  Going around bowing to leaders of other nations and apologizing for our excellence.
[03:34:58.384 --> 03:34:59.205]  Trump doesn't do that.
[03:34:59.605 --> 03:35:03.068]  But again, I mean, just negative story after negative story.
[03:35:03.549 --> 03:35:23.345]  And I guess in between him freeing three Americans from North Korea and doing a rally tonight in front of adoring fans, Trump announces capture most wanted ISIS terrorists who were lured from Syria to Iraq with mobile phone app.
[03:35:24.346 --> 03:35:25.007]  What, Grindr?
[03:35:26.104 --> 03:35:28.626]  What, uh, was it Grindr or Tinder or something?
[03:35:29.446 --> 03:35:30.487]  Of course it was!
[03:35:31.427 --> 03:35:36.730]  So, uh, they captured, uh, four most wanted.
[03:35:37.671 --> 03:35:38.891]  I mean that, uh, five.
[03:35:39.372 --> 03:35:42.734]  Five of the most wanted leaders in ISIS have been captured.
[03:35:43.554 --> 03:35:46.296]  Um, I hope they weren't the JV team.
[03:35:46.956 --> 03:35:52.399]  The junior varsity team that Obama talked about at the beginning of this whole ISIS debacle.
[03:35:52.779 --> 03:35:53.560]  Remember that one?
[03:35:54.475 --> 03:35:58.138]  And again, on Twitter, where I should be banging my head against the wall, I hear it all the time.
[03:35:58.638 --> 03:36:00.320]  Oh, why bring up Obama?
[03:36:00.960 --> 03:36:02.501]  Why bring up Obama?
[03:36:03.622 --> 03:36:04.943]  He has nothing to do with this.
[03:36:05.003 --> 03:36:05.744]  It's Trump.
[03:36:05.784 --> 03:36:06.745]  He's the president now.
[03:36:07.205 --> 03:36:15.592]  Because Trump has spent the first year in office unscrewing what Obama screwed up when he was in office.
[03:36:16.052 --> 03:36:18.714]  So he has to enter the conversation somewhere.
[03:36:20.091 --> 03:36:23.213]  But yeah, so last night we watched Trump do that.
[03:36:23.474 --> 03:36:32.420]  Of course, we have the big meeting between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, scheduled for I think June 7th, was it?
[03:36:32.741 --> 03:36:33.641]  Over in Singapore.
[03:36:34.442 --> 03:36:37.604]  And I mean, think about this.
[03:36:40.587 --> 03:36:46.151]  If, and I know it's an if, but if he swings ending the Korean War,
[03:36:48.744 --> 03:36:49.905]  Ending the Korean War?
[03:36:51.026 --> 03:36:55.349]  And actually works on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula?
[03:36:58.251 --> 03:37:04.115]  What more does a president have to do to literally be the greatest president ever?
[03:37:05.255 --> 03:37:06.556]  It's astounding!
[03:37:06.576 --> 03:37:11.259]  I just can't imagine if that does transpire.
[03:37:11.960 --> 03:37:17.784]  And again, it's an if, but things are moving in the right direction, and we've already
[03:37:18.641 --> 03:37:26.503]  Gone leaps and bounds beyond what any other president has done as far as dealing with North Korea over the course of decades.
[03:37:28.983 --> 03:37:31.744]  But I mean, again, we will not see it.
[03:37:32.144 --> 03:37:38.345]  Do not watch mainstream media and think you're going to get an accurate assessment of what the president's been doing.
[03:37:38.625 --> 03:37:39.105]  You won't.
[03:37:39.745 --> 03:37:41.026]  It's not in their agenda.
[03:37:41.806 --> 03:37:47.927]  There's the holy trinity of liberal garbage, and it's D.C.
[03:37:49.233 --> 03:37:52.575]  It's the mainstream media and Hollywood.
[03:37:54.076 --> 03:38:02.480]  And they are the people that have the most say as far as what everyone in this country hears and sees.
[03:38:03.281 --> 03:38:05.582]  News, movies, television.
[03:38:08.143 --> 03:38:10.965]  They can brainwash a population.
[03:38:11.885 --> 03:38:18.469]  And for some reason, when the likes of Rosie O'Donnell or Whoopi Goldberg speak,
[03:38:19.985 --> 03:38:21.227]  People are inclined to what?
[03:38:21.427 --> 03:38:22.207]  Believe that?
[03:38:23.369 --> 03:38:24.269]  I don't think so.
[03:38:25.531 --> 03:38:28.073]  I think their influence is way overrated.
[03:38:28.393 --> 03:38:29.494]  Especially of late.
[03:38:30.395 --> 03:38:38.643]  I think a lot of people are realizing that there are people out there trying to hoodwink you!
[03:38:39.864 --> 03:38:44.769]  Trying to bamboozle you into believing something that just isn't so.
[03:38:46.946 --> 03:38:48.547]  Whether you like Donald Trump or not.
[03:38:48.867 --> 03:38:51.409]  Whether you think he has a good bedside manner.
[03:38:52.350 --> 03:38:54.932]  Would you like a surgeon, let's say?
[03:38:55.452 --> 03:39:04.379]  If you had a horrible disease and you had to pick a surgeon, would you want an eloquent speaker who screws everything up?
[03:39:05.079 --> 03:39:12.084]  Or would you want some guy that might not have the best bedside manner and way of putting things, but he gets the job done?
[03:39:13.205 --> 03:39:14.106]  I'll go with the second guy.
[03:39:15.143 --> 03:39:15.803]  That's what I'll do.
[03:39:17.184 --> 03:39:20.805]  People have been so used to politicians over the course of the years.
[03:39:21.505 --> 03:39:22.266]  Politicians.
[03:39:22.586 --> 03:39:27.008]  That they don't know what to do when they're being spoken to by a real person anymore.
[03:39:28.128 --> 03:39:38.912]  We've grown so accustomed to seeing these people at the podium throwing out this politis speech and thinking they're actually representing us.
[03:39:39.832 --> 03:39:43.554]  And then you get a guy like Donald Trump gets up there with nothing to lose.
[03:39:44.726 --> 03:39:45.887]  Uh, no agenda?
[03:39:45.907 --> 03:39:47.247]  You don't have an agenda!
[03:39:47.267 --> 03:39:47.887]  The guy's rich!
[03:39:48.728 --> 03:39:50.708]  He just sit on his ass all day!
[03:39:50.748 --> 03:39:51.749]  He could've just done that.
[03:39:52.249 --> 03:39:53.489]  Continue doing what he's doing.
[03:39:53.829 --> 03:39:59.612]  But over the course of, uh, many years, you've seen him talk about this country and what he would like to see.
[03:39:59.632 --> 03:40:02.953]  He actually gets elected president, and he's doing it.
[03:40:04.273 --> 03:40:05.494]  Uh, you just don't see that.
[03:40:05.914 --> 03:40:09.835]  And there are plenty of Republicans, also, that just don't like this at all.
[03:40:10.756 --> 03:40:11.356]  John McCain.
[03:40:12.583 --> 03:40:17.787]  Democrats and Republicans because they are a lot of them are one in the same.
[03:40:18.407 --> 03:40:20.169]  They're professional politicians.
[03:40:20.529 --> 03:40:21.490]  That's their job.
[03:40:22.470 --> 03:40:23.891]  Picture you doing your job.
[03:40:23.951 --> 03:40:24.452]  You're at work.
[03:40:24.632 --> 03:40:25.393]  You're doing your job.
[03:40:26.613 --> 03:40:35.580]  And this, let's just say a blithering idiot comes up and starts doing your job better than you.
[03:40:35.940 --> 03:40:40.844]  And of course, I'm saying you believe he's a blithering idiot, but he's doing your job better than you are.
[03:40:41.835 --> 03:40:46.136]  And the boss is taking notice and people are saying, wow, that guy's good.
[03:40:46.196 --> 03:40:52.517]  And then you don't think you're going to start looking at everybody else and going, what have they been doing the whole time?
[03:40:53.117 --> 03:40:57.638]  If this guy can do the job better, what the hell have you people been doing?
[03:40:58.038 --> 03:41:03.359]  Well, that's what everyone in Washington is thinking when Donald Trump does stuff.
[03:41:04.299 --> 03:41:09.200]  Because they have been holding us hostage, lying to us,
[03:41:10.326 --> 03:41:11.867]  Uh, for their own gains.
[03:41:12.447 --> 03:41:15.688]  Every one of these people are millionaires!
[03:41:16.789 --> 03:41:24.652]  How does a public service job, where you're supposed to be the representative of the people, how do you become a millionaire like that?
[03:41:25.072 --> 03:41:26.793]  You don't think there's a problem there?
[03:41:27.273 --> 03:41:30.975]  And then they're speaking to you about how you should use your money?
[03:41:31.375 --> 03:41:33.876]  And how much of your money you should be allowed to keep?
[03:41:34.685 --> 03:41:38.587]  Are we really that brainwashed over the course of the years?
[03:41:39.128 --> 03:41:40.188]  I think we were.
[03:41:40.208 --> 03:41:44.931]  And I think it took someone like Trump to finally rip the covers off of this stuff.
[03:41:45.411 --> 03:41:57.138]  Like I said, you don't like him, you don't like the way he speaks, you don't like... He's exposing a lot of the garbage that has been preventing us from being the best we can be.
[03:41:58.299 --> 03:42:00.300]  As a country and on an individual basis.
[03:42:01.095 --> 03:42:21.115]  Well, we'll talk about it more on the other side of the break, but I want to talk about Whoopi Goldberg on The View, saying that she can't even fathom, can't see it, doesn't think it exists, anything that Donald Trump has done for African Americans in America.
[03:42:21.495 --> 03:42:25.019]  You would actually have to avoid it!
[03:42:25.737 --> 03:42:28.241]  You don't even have to look for it and go, I can't find it.
[03:42:28.621 --> 03:42:34.350]  You'd have to try to avoid what he has done for Americans.
[03:42:35.302 --> 03:42:37.204]  And like I said, we'll talk about it after this break.
[03:42:37.584 --> 03:42:44.329]  For Americans, it doesn't have to be split up into little different mosaics and demographics.
[03:42:44.890 --> 03:42:47.812]  Americans, that everyone benefits.
[03:42:47.932 --> 03:42:49.073]  We will be right back.
[03:42:49.553 --> 03:42:53.276]  Please do not venture too far from your viewing device.
[03:42:53.676 --> 03:42:56.118]  Anthony Cumia in InfoWars.com.

[03:45:24.051 --> 03:45:39.396]  If you're a regular listener, you know about the spate of lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars, every one of them baseless, every one of them meritless, every one of them bogus, but designed to generate negative headlines and enormous legal bills.
[03:45:39.896 --> 03:45:49.839]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to remove us from the Internet, remove us from YouTube, from Facebook, from Google, and so on.
[03:45:50.459 --> 03:45:53.580]  The costs are astronomical and they're only rising.
[03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:53.960]  Why?
[03:45:54.240 --> 03:45:59.482]  Because Alex Jones is a fighter and he will fight every one of these lawsuits with truth.
[03:46:00.042 --> 03:46:01.803]  Because the truth in the end will win.
[03:46:01.823 --> 03:46:03.983]  But that doesn't mean that it isn't expensive.
[03:46:04.283 --> 03:46:08.945]  So we need you to go to the InfoWars store now and look at some of our terrific products.
[03:46:09.005 --> 03:46:18.608]  Not only do we have our cutting-edge nutraceuticals where Alex Jones and his team of scientists take the very best of ancient Chinese medicine.
[03:46:19.148 --> 03:46:26.791]  In practice for centuries, combining it with cutting-edge new nutraceuticals to bring you formulas that are really effective.
[03:46:27.391 --> 03:46:30.272]  Everything that they put forward has been rigorously tested.
[03:46:30.752 --> 03:46:36.975]  And if you don't believe it, go to the testimonials where you have literally thousands, in some cases, of satisfied customers.
[03:46:37.235 --> 03:46:39.535]  When you go to the site, you're not only helping yourself.
[03:46:39.956 --> 03:46:41.636]  As Alex Jones liked to say, it's a 360-degree win.
[03:46:44.037 --> 03:46:50.763]  You win, and we win, because Alex Jones pumps the money back into InfoWars to pay for our expanded coverage here.
[03:46:51.043 --> 03:46:52.664]  So please, folks, do us a favor.

[03:49:25.719 --> 03:49:32.984]  I was just on Twitter during the break and people were requesting that I do the super blue toothpaste read.
[03:49:34.465 --> 03:49:35.446]  They love it!
[03:49:35.786 --> 03:49:36.286]  Welcome back.
[03:49:36.346 --> 03:49:38.708]  Anthony Cumia in at InfoWars.com.
[03:49:38.728 --> 03:49:39.869]  I was talking about a whoopee
[03:49:40.541 --> 03:49:44.987]  Whoopi Goldberg and the fine, cackling hens of The View.
[03:49:45.007 --> 03:49:53.037]  And Whoopi actually said, she goes on, she goes, she cannot see that Donald Trump has done anything for African Americans.
[03:49:54.022 --> 03:49:54.822]  Here in this country.
[03:49:56.162 --> 03:50:01.584]  The news, how difficult it is for Trump to get any positive press.
[03:50:01.984 --> 03:50:06.885]  Even the news has reported that unemployment amongst African-Americans are at an all-time low.
[03:50:07.205 --> 03:50:10.606]  It's at an all-time low in the United States of America.
[03:50:10.746 --> 03:50:11.286]  Amazing!
[03:50:11.566 --> 03:50:12.746]  Just an amazing thing.
[03:50:13.586 --> 03:50:16.647]  And for some reason I guess Whoopi missed that.
[03:50:17.327 --> 03:50:19.687]  I guess she didn't notice that one.
[03:50:20.308 --> 03:50:21.788]  The other thing I noticed is
[03:50:22.725 --> 03:50:25.447]  They have to word things.
[03:50:25.687 --> 03:50:28.769]  What has Donald Trump done for African-Americans?
[03:50:29.189 --> 03:50:32.551]  What has Donald Trump done for gays and immigrants?
[03:50:33.031 --> 03:50:39.795]  Everything's a subsector, like some special thing has to be doled out to every group.
[03:50:42.377 --> 03:50:45.679]  Donald Trump seems to be doing things that are good for the country.
[03:50:46.756 --> 03:50:48.917]  It really is what it's supposed to be!
[03:50:48.937 --> 03:51:13.244]  If we're all equal, have the same opportunities in this grand nation of ours, wouldn't the president then have to be somebody that makes the country a place that you can prosper as an American, regardless of color, race, religion, whatever the hell, sexual orientation, whatever you want!
[03:51:13.906 --> 03:51:20.752]  If he's doing things that affect all Americans positively, doesn't that include African Americans?
[03:51:21.453 --> 03:51:27.838]  Why is there always this need amongst liberal Democrats to make it this separate thing?
[03:51:28.519 --> 03:51:33.123]  I don't see anything here that Donald Trump signed that says African American on it.
[03:51:33.904 --> 03:51:36.166]  Yeah, what about everything that just helps Americans?
[03:51:36.926 --> 03:51:39.709]  I've never seen a more divided
[03:51:40.896 --> 03:51:43.979]  People than I do amongst liberals.
[03:51:44.499 --> 03:51:49.683]  They're constantly thinking in terms of skin color and religion and sexual orientation.
[03:51:50.204 --> 03:51:51.545]  It's bizarre.
[03:51:52.185 --> 03:51:53.226]  It's just bizarre.
[03:51:53.506 --> 03:52:02.554]  But for some reason, people clamor for it and read and think that Donald Trump isn't doing anything for a specific group.
[03:52:02.874 --> 03:52:03.275]  He is.
[03:52:03.935 --> 03:52:04.656]  Americans.
[03:52:05.596 --> 03:52:06.998]  And it's refreshing to see.
[03:52:07.358 --> 03:52:09.780]  Because then no one feels like they're being left out.
[03:52:10.603 --> 03:52:18.226]  When you cater to one group or another, a bunch of other sub-sectors and groups and demographics are getting a little mad.
[03:52:19.046 --> 03:52:23.988]  But if you're actually making things better for everybody, then it's just your choice.
[03:52:24.288 --> 03:52:30.950]  Now it's up to you to utilize all the amazing tools and opportunities that this country offers to make something of yourself.
[03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:33.131]  And if you don't do that, who do you got to blame?
[03:52:33.931 --> 03:52:36.212]  That's right, I'm pointing right at you out there.
[03:52:37.072 --> 03:52:37.592]  That's right.
[03:52:38.413 --> 03:52:39.433]  Hollywood is just
[03:52:40.968 --> 03:52:41.848]  It's a disaster.
[03:52:42.569 --> 03:52:48.111]  And I love that it's being exposed also, like the mainstream media and Washington.
[03:52:48.411 --> 03:52:49.571]  Hollywood's being exposed.
[03:52:49.991 --> 03:52:53.532]  There are a bunch of, as my grandfather used to say, preverts!
[03:52:54.053 --> 03:52:56.434]  What a bunch of preverts out there!
[03:52:56.834 --> 03:53:06.577]  And they're liars, and they're trying to manipulate your ideas through their entertainment.
[03:53:07.317 --> 03:53:08.478]  That sounds far-fetched?
[03:53:08.758 --> 03:53:08.898]  No.
[03:53:09.815 --> 03:53:10.995]  Think about it for two seconds.
[03:53:11.436 --> 03:53:14.737]  Watch commercials.
[03:53:15.517 --> 03:53:19.999]  I never really thought I would be so into watching commercials.
[03:53:20.419 --> 03:53:23.780]  But it's a study in brainwashing.
[03:53:24.561 --> 03:53:26.661]  It's a study in indoctrination.
[03:53:27.382 --> 03:53:30.863]  I see things in commercials that you don't see in real life.
[03:53:31.563 --> 03:53:33.204]  And I live and work in New York.
[03:53:34.455 --> 03:53:48.623]  I see every type of liberal ideology walking around and orientation, whether it's same-sex, interracial, gender fluid.
[03:53:48.723 --> 03:53:50.624]  I see it all here in New York.
[03:53:51.264 --> 03:53:54.846]  It's a melting pot of debauchery, but I see it.
[03:53:57.047 --> 03:54:02.670]  And I don't see as much as I do when I watch any television commercial, especially on network television.
[03:54:03.774 --> 03:54:05.175]  It's just insane.
[03:54:06.255 --> 03:54:11.678]  You see people that you would see on Wall Street as the people that are robbing the house.
[03:54:12.598 --> 03:54:13.879]  They're the ones robbing the house.
[03:54:15.259 --> 03:54:22.823]  Every video I watch on YouTube or LiveLeak or anywhere where I see, oh look at this, it's a security camera catching a home invasion.
[03:54:23.463 --> 03:54:25.684]  Never looks like the people in the commercials.
[03:54:27.285 --> 03:54:32.567]  It's this purposeful thing to make, I think, to make straight white men look like blithering idiots.
[03:54:33.802 --> 03:54:43.851]  There's always a woman there or a minority to help the poor mentally challenged white man through his daily chores.
[03:54:44.832 --> 03:54:48.335]  And if you don't think this is an agenda, you're out of your mind.
[03:54:48.875 --> 03:54:51.197]  There is just this tragic story.
[03:54:51.297 --> 03:54:52.959]  I'll finish up with this one.
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:55.601]  If we're finished, I'm not even sure.
[03:54:55.881 --> 03:54:56.822]  A tragic story.
[03:54:58.043 --> 03:54:58.944]  There was a young boy
[03:54:59.907 --> 03:55:00.828]  Uh, at a gun show.
[03:55:01.389 --> 03:55:07.335]  And he's dry-firing a weapon, and very interested in the action and everything, and a girl's talking to him, and he seems really happy with it.
[03:55:08.679 --> 03:55:15.425]  It was safe, completely safe, and people were on Twitter saying how this was a living nightmare, a hell.
[03:55:15.786 --> 03:55:23.974]  It's a hell going on that this child is at an NRA convention and he's racking the action of a weapon.
[03:55:24.274 --> 03:55:24.674]  Oh God!
[03:55:24.935 --> 03:55:32.302]  This whole country, by the way, has a tradition since its inception of fathers teaching their sons
[03:55:33.433 --> 03:55:41.881]  Gun safety, how to be proficient with a gun, whether it was in the old days where it was necessary for hunting, for food, or for protection.
[03:55:42.641 --> 03:55:45.164]  It's been a tradition in this country.
[03:55:46.405 --> 03:55:49.848]  And then the same people tweet, yeah there he is, look at the little tyke.
[03:55:50.529 --> 03:55:56.495]  And then the same people tweet a drag queen nine-year-old.
[03:55:57.509 --> 03:56:04.773]  A nine-year-old drag queen and say, this is the future and we're here to see it.
[03:56:05.373 --> 03:56:09.195]  Like it's an amazing thing that people should be proud of.
[03:56:09.656 --> 03:56:26.965]  This is terrible, the kid with the rifle, a cross-dressing nine-year-old being paraded in a sexual manner in front of adult men who are also dressed like women, is the future and that's what we should be focused on.
[03:56:27.882 --> 03:56:33.286]  And that comes straight out of Hollywood, straight out of the liberal left.
[03:56:34.007 --> 03:56:43.034]  Mainstream media praises it and presents it in a way that should be looked at as completely normal and fine.
[03:56:43.995 --> 03:56:54.883]  And if you dare use words like child abuse or indoctrination, I absolutely believe when you take a child of six, seven, nine years old
[03:56:55.601 --> 03:56:57.883]  And, and dress that child up like a girl.
[03:56:58.203 --> 03:56:58.763]  It's a boy.
[03:56:59.043 --> 03:57:01.145]  You dress him up like a girl and parade him around.
[03:57:01.725 --> 03:57:05.108]  It is a brand new form of Munchausen Syndrome by proxy.
[03:57:06.569 --> 03:57:09.311]  That, that is when a mother, usually a mother,
[03:57:10.718 --> 03:57:15.841]  Physically abuses or poisons a child so they can get attention by the nurses at a hospital.
[03:57:16.122 --> 03:57:24.547]  Well nowadays, it's dress your kid like a girl and go around to all your friends and say how amazing my gender-fluid seven-year-old is.
[03:57:25.047 --> 03:57:27.409]  And that's now the new normal thing.
[03:57:27.969 --> 03:57:37.075]  A child with his dad using a rifle is terrible, even though that, like I said, since the inception of this country.
[03:57:37.827 --> 03:57:38.487]  That's what it's been.
[03:57:38.968 --> 03:57:41.171]  I'd love to have more time, but I'll see you next time.
[03:57:41.452 --> 03:57:42.653]  Anthony Comey in at InfoWars.
[03:57:42.894 --> 03:57:45.337]  Catch me at compoundmedia.com.
[03:57:45.377 --> 03:57:47.040]  Until next time, Arriva 13.
[03:57:56.832 --> 03:58:05.596]  InfoWars is celebrating the amazing gains we've all made against the globalists and how we have given tyranny a bloody nose and now freedom is back on the march.
[03:58:05.996 --> 03:58:13.380]  That's why we're celebrating Patriots Day this April throughout the month with double Patriot points at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:13.680 --> 03:58:16.721]  No longer 5%, but now 10% at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:24.966 --> 03:58:26.807]  Desiree, thanks for holding her on the air from California.
[03:58:26.847 --> 03:58:27.107]  Go ahead.
[03:58:27.247 --> 03:58:31.129]  Just wanted to let you know I've been listening to you for about six years now.
[03:58:31.269 --> 03:58:36.271]  My husband turned me on to you and absolutely I could not stand you.
[03:58:36.831 --> 03:58:42.354]  For about the first two months I listened to you and now I listen every single day to your phone.
[03:58:43.154 --> 03:58:43.815]  We're good to go.
