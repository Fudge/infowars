[00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:12.299]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:20.343]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:36.951]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order, a world where the rule of law
[00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.575]  Not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of nations.
[00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:44.719]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.825]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:53.029]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.132]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:09.906]  And they had kids in incubators, and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:16.589]  Just two hours ago, Allied Air Forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait.
[00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.272]  Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations, was crushed.
[00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:24.574]  Its people brutalized.
[00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:30.010]  Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait.
[00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.290]  Tonight, the battle has been joined.
[00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:49.473]  And that was twenty-eight years ago.
[00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:52.374]  And now George Herbert
[00:01:53.223 --> 00:01:58.425]  Walker Bush, whose father was the head Nazi in the United States, almost brought down the country with Hitler.
[00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:04.847]  The man who helped give China a one-sided trade deal that has de-industrialized this nation.
[00:02:06.728 --> 00:02:13.551]  The man who promoted the whole Rockefeller-Carnegie endowment project for world government and helped shut down the industry in this nation.
[00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:16.672]  The man who said the NRA should be shut down.
[00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:18.993]  The anti-gun
[00:02:20.154 --> 00:02:26.759]  Democrat, open borders Democrat, masquerading as a conservative, as a nationalist, is dead.
[00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:36.828]  But that isn't stopping the corporate media from worshipping him in just a disgusting fashion, like they did John McCain.
[00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:43.073]  Well, I am not going to sit here and lie about George H.W.
[00:02:43.093 --> 00:02:43.373]  Bush.
[00:02:44.354 --> 00:02:45.695]  He was not an American.
[00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:47.857]  He was a globalist.
[00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:50.131]  And he ordered U.S.
[00:02:50.812 --> 00:03:08.221]  and Russian munitions that had been sold to Saddam Hussein, at more than a hundred sites like Kamasya, to be detonated and destroyed in place, knowing that it would rain down chemical weapons that would precipitate out in the brainstem and cause hundreds of thousands of the troops to die.
[00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.724]  The casualties of Gulf War I, where they claimed only a few hundred people died on our side, is a lie.
[00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:22.751]  The casualties are now estimated, with top experts I've had, like Dr. Doug Rocky from the Army and others, at 300 plus thousand.
[00:03:23.892 --> 00:03:34.342]  And they would deny care to those soldiers, marines, airmen, sailors, because this man was a monster.
[00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:39.658]  An absolute America-hating monster with every fiber of his being.
[00:03:40.978 --> 00:03:42.999]  A globalist selling this country out.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.941]  We're all supposed to forget about that and have him be rehabilitated now.
[00:03:50.582 --> 00:03:51.962]  Have him be rehabilitated now.
[00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:53.323]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:54.824 --> 00:04:06.189]  George Herbert Walker Bush presided over the attempt to wreck this country, to run it into the rocks, and help parlay our power into the monster that we now face, Communist China.
[00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:09.171]  He was a David Rockefeller protégé.
[00:04:10.671 --> 00:04:17.555]  He was a Rockefeller Republican, which means basically the Clintons.
[00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:20.156]  And he helped create the Clintons.
[00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:21.456]  That was all a ruse in 1992.
[00:04:23.993 --> 00:04:24.633]  He worked for them.
[00:04:25.534 --> 00:04:26.054]  They for he.
[00:04:26.754 --> 00:04:29.735]  And later, of course I told you that 20-something years ago, they basically admitted it.
[00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:30.955]  That they were all family.
[00:04:34.176 --> 00:04:34.636]  All family.
[00:04:34.656 --> 00:04:41.639]  You know, it's fitting that the Clintons can't even get a thousand people to come see them speak now all over the country on their tour.
[00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:45.080]  And there was the headline in the New York Times, it's curtains for the Clintons.
[00:04:46.548 --> 00:04:52.956]  These old rotting trees of globalism are all kind of blew over in the windstorm that's sweeping the world.
[00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:57.402]  Oh, and in Spain, right-wing nationalists just won a big election.
[00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:01.728]  So the good news is, globalism's dead, and it's just now figuring it out.

[00:05:57.216 --> 00:05:57.356]  Yep!
[00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:08.328]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:14.051]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:19.174 --> 00:06:34.443]  George Herbert Walker Bush's pedigree of globalism, of the Trilateral Commission, of the CFR, working against this country, is the most thoroughbred
[00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:36.542]  I've ever seen.
[00:06:37.002 --> 00:06:39.783]  He came very close to destroying this country.
[00:06:40.723 --> 00:06:43.024]  And he still may be successful from the grave.
[00:06:44.244 --> 00:07:02.249]  But one thing the New York Times and CNN got right, and many others, Washington Post, they all had similar headlines, similar PR, when George Herbert Walker Bush died Friday, was that Donald J. Trump and George Herbert Walker Bush are totally different men.
[00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.510]  Complete opposites.
[00:07:06.294 --> 00:07:06.654]  That's right.
[00:07:06.874 --> 00:07:09.275]  One is for world government, unelected, unaccountable.
[00:07:10.255 --> 00:07:11.816]  One helps sell us out to communist China.
[00:07:15.737 --> 00:07:17.118]  One is totally for this nation.
[00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:26.261]  And in less than two years had the country almost turned around until the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on purpose to scuttle, to wreck the recovery.
[00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:32.903]  And you go over the anti-gun, open border promotion of George W. Bush or his father.
[00:07:34.502 --> 00:07:36.543]  Being the top Nazi in the U.S.
[00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:37.704]  on record.
[00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:54.374]  And it really is flabbergasting to think about how they set this country on course to be completely sold out and de-industrialized, the Chi-Coms.
[00:07:54.774 --> 00:07:55.735]  I mean, he was the U.S.
[00:07:55.795 --> 00:07:57.296]  ambassador that got the deal done.
[00:07:57.656 --> 00:07:59.817]  He was the head of the CIA that set it all up.
[00:08:00.198 --> 00:08:02.399]  He's the guy that shipped the narcotics into the country.
[00:08:05.074 --> 00:08:10.439]  If it's bad, if it's evil, it was George Herbert Walker Bush who had his hands all over it.
[00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:11.800]  Ronald Reagan hated him.
[00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:14.143]  We can play the clips.
[00:08:14.503 --> 00:08:15.324]  We've played them before.
[00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:20.569]  Ronald Reagan talks about how bad George Herbert Walker Bush is.
[00:08:20.609 --> 00:08:25.013]  Ronald Reagan talks about George Herbert Walker Bush and the Trilateral Commission and how he wants world government.
[00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:29.435]  That was on the campaign trail in 1979-1980.
[00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:38.782]  And they told Reagan at the convention, you're not going to get the nomination if you don't put George Herbert Walker Bush in.
[00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:54.453]  And then a good family friend, John Hinckley Jr., best friends with the family, CIA, goes and two nights after meeting with the Bushes, Denver Post reported, and shoots Ronald Reagan.
[00:08:57.116 --> 00:09:02.881]  And Nancy Reagan would not even talk to the Bushes after that point.
[00:09:03.462 --> 00:09:10.107]  Would not even talk to them and Reagan, except for photo ops, stopped having him even in the room with him.
[00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:13.470]  Oh yeah.
[00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:24.020]  I know the folks that know the Reagans very closely and I remember I was told this by some sources before it ever came out and the letters were released a few years ago of
[00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:29.828]  John F. Kennedy's wife, saying that she knew LBJ had ordered her husband killed.
[00:09:31.649 --> 00:09:33.150]  Well, it's the same thing with Nancy.
[00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.491]  I know people that had conversations with her before she died.
[00:09:35.511 --> 00:09:40.573]  I'm not at liberty to say their names, but you know, we get some big info here.
[00:09:40.893 --> 00:09:44.875]  Like when Matt Drudge came and laid out the whole Internet censorship plan, the Supreme Court Justice told him.
[00:09:46.316 --> 00:09:50.298]  We get some hardcore folks here on the air, and off the air,
[00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:54.348]  And Nancy Reagan, well it's on record she hated the Bushes and wouldn't talk to them.
[00:09:55.068 --> 00:09:57.049]  After Ronnie was shot.
[00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.511]  But I'm not going to sit here and celebrate these thugs.
[00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:02.292]  Everybody else is scared of them.
[00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:04.213]  And I'm not whistling past the graveyard.
[00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:06.614]  I'm not trying to stick my head in a lion's mouth for no reason.
[00:10:07.395 --> 00:10:20.382]  For my children and your children in the future, we've got to stop worshipping these globalists and letting the mainstream media put a cherry and some whipped cream and nuts on top of the big, giant, stinking pile of feces these people crapped on us.
[00:10:22.073 --> 00:10:27.975]  Throwing out a perfume dumped onto a latrine to an open sewer is going to fix it.
[00:10:28.615 --> 00:10:35.997]  Now, speaking of folks connected to the President, he's coming on later in the broadcast, our own Roger Stone.
[00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:39.238]  Trump tweeted this out today, I will never testify against Trump.
[00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:48.761]  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out-of-control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President Trump.
[00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:51.182]  Nice to know that some people still have guts.
[00:10:52.691 --> 00:10:55.993]  And Roger has said this here over and over again, and in private to me.
[00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:26.093]  He can't say anything about the President because there's nothing.
[00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:31.256]  There's no Russiagate, there's no nothing.
[00:11:31.916 --> 00:11:37.339]  There's nothing but us trying to talk to Julian Assange.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:47.105]  Believe me, I don't want to be in the middle of this, but we've confirmed from dozens of people, dozens, that about a third of the questions are about yours truly.
[00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:50.647]  There's not even any reason to ask questions about me.
[00:11:52.822 --> 00:12:06.951]  I'm on record that Julian Assange would never give us the time of day that would go on Fox, CNN, New York Times, BBC, constantly, until I called him Hillary Clinton's corruption protector.
[00:12:07.491 --> 00:12:14.655]  I had a more disgusting name for it, but you've all heard the funny story about the big fat elephant and the cork in its rear end and the monkey that pulls it out.
[00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:23.030]  And what I meant was, is let's get all the dirt on her out now.
[00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.550]  Let's go.
[00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:25.792]  He wanted to wait until October.
[00:12:27.873 --> 00:12:28.753]  And maybe he was right.
[00:12:28.873 --> 00:12:30.734]  I was worried they were going to shut him down before then.
[00:12:30.794 --> 00:12:32.155]  And I think Julian Assange is a hero.
[00:12:33.956 --> 00:12:37.818]  But boy, we've been defending him saying he deserves a pardon.
[00:12:37.878 --> 00:12:38.679]  Nobody else is.
[00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:45.783]  All those mainstream media people that he went and talked to, and that he leaked stuff to through his lawyers,
[00:12:47.153 --> 00:12:49.335]  Are any of them getting investigated for Russia stuff?
[00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:50.656]  No!
[00:12:51.337 --> 00:13:01.086]  It's those of us that were beating down his door and the door stayed shut and completely silent.
[00:13:04.328 --> 00:13:12.396]  But we were able, because we're not idiots, to go reverse engineer
[00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:40.026]  What would probably be in Hillary's foundation emails, because these were bigger than breadcrumbs, these were bread trucks, these were bakeries, each one, of all the Reuters, AP, New York Times, used to do some real reporting, and they had her, Hillary's Uranium One problem, Hillary's Russia problem, Hillary took 20-something million, gave them 25% of the uranium, Mueller was on the tarmac.
[00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:45.167]  This was all in the news years ago, before it became a campaign issue.
[00:13:48.706 --> 00:13:51.529]  And so yes, we are the ones that popularized all that.
[00:13:53.891 --> 00:14:01.658]  That's why we're really in trouble, is because we stood up for America, we restored the Republic, the economy started to turn around, that would make us folk heroes.
[00:14:02.198 --> 00:14:06.842]  That would make America have a new culture, and celebrate its rebirth of Americana.
[00:14:07.623 --> 00:14:13.048]  From the culture of death and hating ourselves, back to the future, the Renaissance.
[00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:29.820]  Oh, they can't have that, so they have to demonize me, they have to demonize Trump, they have to demonize Roger Stone, they have to demonize Dr. Corsi, they have to demonize the independent press, they have to call us fake news, and oh, we're the Russians, because they're the globalists that say America was never great, will never be that great!
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.601]  And there's all these new statements by Democrats, I can't even keep track of them!
[00:14:33.982 --> 00:14:36.163]  There's videos on Infowars.com today!
[00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:44.845]  With all these Democrat Congress people and CNN hosts saying America sucks and America's over and America's already peaked.
[00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.445]  That was Fareed Zarkaria today.
[00:14:46.705 --> 00:14:49.106]  That Bill Bilderberg globalist.
[00:14:49.766 --> 00:14:52.107]  Their culture is hating America!
[00:14:54.007 --> 00:14:55.268]  That's the globalist culture!
[00:14:58.669 --> 00:14:59.629]  And it makes me sick.
[00:15:01.178 --> 00:15:01.799]  It really does.
[00:15:02.699 --> 00:15:19.553]  That then they can turn around and point at us, who are totally pro-America, pro-First Amendment, pro-private property, pro-gun, pro-religious freedom, pro-sovereignty, pro-constitutional government, absolute flaming Americana believers.
[00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:22.715]  I mean, we are on fire.
[00:15:23.316 --> 00:15:25.518]  And then, what do the outside globalists do?
[00:15:27.287 --> 00:15:32.434]  Out of one side of their mouth they say they hate the country and then actively try to run it in the ground and bankrupt it and kill the recovery.
[00:15:32.735 --> 00:15:37.221]  Now the other side they point at us and say we are the traitors?
[00:15:39.215 --> 00:15:41.356]  Man, if the public buys that, they're really stupid.
[00:15:41.376 --> 00:15:42.457]  But you see why they're doing it?
[00:15:42.477 --> 00:15:43.798]  Because they're the outsiders.
[00:15:43.838 --> 00:15:44.458]  They're the traitors.
[00:15:44.698 --> 00:15:45.338]  They're the enemies.
[00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:47.219]  All right, we've got a ton of news.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.800]  France is on fire.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:50.121]  Macron may declare martial law.
[00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:51.782]  More nationals getting elected everywhere.
[00:15:52.142 --> 00:15:52.782]  We're on the march.
[00:15:52.822 --> 00:15:53.903]  The empire is on the run.
[00:15:54.263 --> 00:15:57.565]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:57.805 --> 00:15:59.126]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:59.446 --> 00:16:00.727]  Stay with us and spread the word.
[00:16:02.438 --> 00:16:08.920]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:16:10.632 --> 00:16:12.073]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:16:12.314 --> 00:16:17.258]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:24.345]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:32.772]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[00:16:33.533 --> 00:16:59.702]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[00:17:00.948 --> 00:17:07.271]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:09.471]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:14.453]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[00:17:14.914 --> 00:17:15.414]  It's big.
[00:17:15.954 --> 00:17:16.374]  It's bad.
[00:17:16.814 --> 00:17:22.036]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[00:17:22.056 --> 00:17:24.357]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[00:17:24.778 --> 00:17:27.979]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:29.562]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:17:29.582 --> 00:17:30.764]  That's been going on for over a month.
[00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:32.749]  50 to 75% off.
[00:17:32.769 --> 00:17:33.791]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[00:17:34.844 --> 00:17:35.785]  The Double Patriot points.
[00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:36.725]  That's what happened in about a week.
[00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:43.709]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:48.551]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:17:48.571 --> 00:17:50.452]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:17:50.713 --> 00:17:52.533]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:17:52.714 --> 00:17:54.775]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:54.935 --> 00:17:58.957]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:14.692]  I've been on air 23 plus years and I've learned a lot about sales because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution, Bill of Rights and our way of life.
[00:18:15.532 --> 00:18:20.114]  I was never classically trained but over the last 23 years I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[00:18:20.814 --> 00:18:26.096]  Now there's lots of philosophies about have something really really expensive and a certain percentage will buy it believing it's the best.
[00:18:26.876 --> 00:18:27.797]  That's not what I do.
[00:18:28.597 --> 00:18:31.138]  I try to find the very best products that are popular
[00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:34.860]  Get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:36.141]  That seems to be like common sense.
[00:18:36.262 --> 00:18:44.548]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[00:18:44.568 --> 00:18:51.833]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, water filtration, gravity-fed systems, because they're the very best.
[00:18:51.974 --> 00:18:54.555]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price.
[00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:56.597]  And so, we are the biggest distributor.
[00:18:56.797 --> 00:18:59.839]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.161]  Of 127 on that water filtration system.
[00:19:03.181 --> 00:19:05.502]  Because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:06.842]  We sold out of it.
[00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:07.983]  They didn't think we could do it.
[00:19:08.623 --> 00:19:09.203]  You responded.
[00:19:09.243 --> 00:19:10.223]  You went and did your own research.
[00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.624]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[00:19:12.104 --> 00:19:16.806]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filtration four-stage ion filter.
[00:19:16.866 --> 00:19:20.447]  When they came to me five years ago and said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[00:19:20.487 --> 00:19:21.407]  Leading competitors are $500, $600, $800, $1,000.
[00:19:21.667 --> 00:19:23.468]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[00:19:23.488 --> 00:19:24.248]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:24.548]  I said, great.
[00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:24.848]  Absolutely.
[00:19:24.908 --> 00:19:25.849]  I just bought filters for $400.
[00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:30.150]  I think so.
[00:20:06.897 --> 00:20:09.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:28.453]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:28.773 --> 00:20:33.054]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.876 --> 00:20:51.802]  They've got groups of individuals showing up to take photos and wave and cheer for the body of George H.W.
[00:20:51.842 --> 00:20:52.122]  Bush.
[00:20:53.303 --> 00:20:55.884]  Being flown to Lyon State in Washington D.C.
[00:20:56.664 --> 00:20:57.165]  on Wednesday.
[00:20:57.185 --> 00:21:00.446]  They're supposed to shut the part of the government down.
[00:21:00.466 --> 00:21:17.032]  They're going to shut the stock market down in honor of this individual who tried to completely destroy the country's economy, sign it over to China, help sell the nation out, tried to prop up the old Soviet Union, tried to keep oligarchs in charge over there.
[00:21:17.052 --> 00:21:18.653]  That's all been confirmed.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.584]  He did everything he could to keep the New World Order going.
[00:21:23.604 --> 00:21:27.008]  And that's a New World Order where the United States did not have sovereignty.
[00:21:27.288 --> 00:21:35.817]  He signed on to the UNESCO Global Biological Diversity Treaty, the carbon tax treaties, all of it in 1992.
[00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:41.984]  Congress didn't ratify any of it, but it shows the damage this individual did.
[00:21:43.456 --> 00:21:52.338]  So they get these tight little throngs of bureaucrats and minions of the Bushes out there to make it look like he's a rock star.
[00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:56.039]  But notice how close, if you're watching on TV, the camera shot is.
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.881]  That's because it's not a very big crowd of people.
[00:22:03.981 --> 00:22:06.022]  And there he goes, taking off out of Houston.
[00:22:06.902 --> 00:22:08.303]  We're going to play at the end of this segment.
[00:22:08.323 --> 00:22:09.383]  This is a short clip of him
[00:22:10.552 --> 00:22:13.933]  Lying about babies in incubators that were never killed, that didn't exist.
[00:22:14.694 --> 00:22:15.354]  That's confirmed.
[00:22:15.474 --> 00:22:19.136]  They admit the babies in incubators, 1990, never happened.
[00:22:19.636 --> 00:22:24.178]  He told Saddam Hussein through April Gillespie, U.S.
[00:22:24.218 --> 00:22:26.099]  Ambassador, to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[00:22:26.499 --> 00:22:28.580]  Saddam had taken the order, put in by the CIA in 79.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.821]  He'd taken the order in 82 to start the
[00:22:35.174 --> 00:22:47.740]  Iraq-Iran war, or the Iran-Iraq war that killed several million Iranians and 600,000 or so, if my memory serves, folks there on the Iraqi side.
[00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:56.264]  And then Saddam wanted his $30 billion in debt forgiven because he'd done it for the United States, and they said, nope!
[00:22:57.346 --> 00:23:00.807]  Because they were globalists and they set him up to destabilize the region.
[00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:03.108]  And now it's far worse off today.
[00:23:03.128 --> 00:23:05.309]  And that's just some of the legacy of this guy.
[00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:13.573]  We see a New World Order coming into view where nation-states are subservient to the United Nations.
[00:23:14.213 --> 00:23:15.154]  Founders' dreams.
[00:23:17.755 --> 00:23:19.776]  And back then we'd point out, hey, the New World Order's bad.
[00:23:19.816 --> 00:23:20.376]  We don't want it.
[00:23:21.257 --> 00:23:22.758]  And they go, there's no new world order.
[00:23:22.818 --> 00:23:23.779]  No one wants world government.
[00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:27.142]  We're like, well, George Herbert Walker Bush writes books about it.
[00:23:28.704 --> 00:23:29.825]  That's what's crazy about this.
[00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:33.328]  Now, I don't want to spend all day on Bush.
[00:23:33.348 --> 00:23:35.470]  So I'm going to be done talking about him here in a few minutes.
[00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.832]  And we have a bunch of guests coming up today.
[00:23:37.972 --> 00:23:39.794]  Obviously, there's so much to get to.
[00:23:39.854 --> 00:23:41.735]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be down on the border.
[00:23:42.176 --> 00:23:43.237]  He's the founder of Oath Keepers.
[00:23:43.257 --> 00:23:45.299]  He's got an exclusive announcement for us.
[00:23:45.339 --> 00:23:46.340]  He'll be in studio tomorrow.
[00:23:47.768 --> 00:23:53.711]  Owen Benjamin, always doing a great job, will be hosting the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone with The War Room today.
[00:23:55.831 --> 00:24:03.375]  I want to get into the huge situation unfolding in France, especially, and why it's a bellwether for what's going to happen around the rest of the world.
[00:24:03.395 --> 00:24:10.638]  We're also going to look at the attempts of the Federal Reserve to plunge our economy and how this is real treason.
[00:24:12.153 --> 00:24:17.817]  Also, the census confirms 63% of non-citizens on welfare, 4.6 million households.
[00:24:20.219 --> 00:24:22.060]  That's what it's designed to do, is bankrupt the nation.
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.482]  That is all coming up.
[00:24:24.542 --> 00:24:27.404]  But first, let me make this really big and exciting announcement.
[00:24:30.807 --> 00:24:33.369]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this limited run shirt.
[00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:41.362]  The crew had the idea to do because there's a popular saying on the internet, we're all Alex Jones, don't censor me.
[00:24:41.822 --> 00:24:47.424]  And it's got the Gadsden coiled snake instead of don't tread on me or won't tread on me.
[00:24:47.564 --> 00:24:50.865]  It says, we're all Alex Jones, don't censor me.
[00:24:50.885 --> 00:24:55.287]  It's a very soft, nice fabric, black on white t-shirt.
[00:24:57.128 --> 00:25:03.110]  It is absolutely free at infowarestore.com with any purchase.
[00:25:04.639 --> 00:25:09.823]  That means one tube of toothpaste, fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue.
[00:25:11.865 --> 00:25:15.328]  Or a water filtration system, where you buy another t-shirt, you get this one free.
[00:25:15.748 --> 00:25:17.369]  And there's store-wide free shipping.
[00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:23.434]  And there's 50 to 75% off across the board on thousands of items.
[00:25:23.454 --> 00:25:27.177]  50% is the lowest special, 75% is the highest.
[00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:29.339]  We are selling all of our inventory out.
[00:25:30.609 --> 00:25:39.153]  To go leaner and meaner into the new year, because you've seen how Soros and the Globos are trying to shut down InfoWars, trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut us down.
[00:25:39.213 --> 00:25:55.239]  So this way you don't battle the crowds, you don't battle the traffic, you get hands down the best deals we've ever offered on best-selling items that would still probably sell out some of the stuff we've got by February or so.
[00:25:55.339 --> 00:25:59.161]  No, I'm selling the entire warehouse right here in Austin, Texas out.
[00:25:59.963 --> 00:26:01.544]  By the end of this year.
[00:26:01.644 --> 00:26:02.985]  And we're on line to do it.
[00:26:03.025 --> 00:26:04.066]  So everything's for sale.
[00:26:04.566 --> 00:26:05.687]  Some things are about to sell out.
[00:26:05.727 --> 00:26:06.668]  Some things have already sold out.
[00:26:06.708 --> 00:26:09.009]  We still have, I'd say, 90% of our different items.
[00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:13.092]  But in the next few days, obviously, those numbers are going to start going down.
[00:26:13.152 --> 00:26:14.373]  But right now, it's all there.
[00:26:14.513 --> 00:26:17.275]  X3, X2, bodies, ultimate turmeric formula.
[00:26:19.116 --> 00:26:19.897]  But let me say that again.
[00:26:20.657 --> 00:26:24.820]  You get storewide free shipping, 50 to 75% off, double Patriot points on your next order.
[00:26:25.321 --> 00:26:28.403]  So instead of 5% on each dollar, you get 10 cents on every dollar.
[00:26:30.438 --> 00:26:31.138]  This is insane.
[00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:34.199]  And this free t-shirt.
[00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.680]  Now, they printed 5,000 of these up.
[00:26:38.321 --> 00:26:43.842]  So that means by the end of this week, because Christmas sales are always heavy, these shirts will be sold out.
[00:26:43.902 --> 00:26:45.543]  This is a limited edition.
[00:26:46.123 --> 00:26:46.983]  We're all Alex Jones.
[00:26:47.023 --> 00:26:47.924]  Don't censor me.
[00:26:47.964 --> 00:26:55.106]  And then it'll be a new shirt that will be the free gift that you get with it.
[00:26:56.024 --> 00:26:57.947]  It'll be another one of these great shirts we've got.
[00:26:58.808 --> 00:27:00.970]  But they're all there at infowarestore.com.
[00:27:02.693 --> 00:27:03.954]  So you cannot beat this deal.
[00:27:03.994 --> 00:27:09.401]  This is way above even the specials I've been running the last two months that have already been our biggest ever.
[00:27:11.023 --> 00:27:12.024]  So take advantage of it.
[00:27:13.001 --> 00:27:14.782]  Help us fund ourselves into next year.
[00:27:15.462 --> 00:27:17.163]  Try some of the great products you've never tried.
[00:27:17.323 --> 00:27:18.683]  Try Alpha Power.
[00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:20.544]  Try Brain Force.
[00:27:21.084 --> 00:27:22.325]  Try X3.
[00:27:22.945 --> 00:27:29.688]  Try Super Male and Super Female Vitality, which is incredibly high quality, cold-pressed herbs, five-star ratings.
[00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:31.248]  We've had it out for four years.
[00:27:32.249 --> 00:27:35.710]  I'm discontinuing it because it's so expensive for us to make.
[00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:40.392]  It's so proprietary where we get it from Utah, one of the biggest firms out there, and
[00:27:42.372 --> 00:27:42.832]  I'm just done.
[00:27:44.113 --> 00:27:45.835]  That's it for Supermel Vitality.
[00:27:45.875 --> 00:27:46.315]  It's amazing.
[00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:47.456]  If you want it, it's there.
[00:27:47.897 --> 00:27:49.258]  Alpha Power is organic.
[00:27:49.838 --> 00:27:50.819]  It's a similar formula.
[00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:51.660]  It's even stronger.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.601]  But it's not cold-pressed.
[00:27:53.681 --> 00:27:56.684]  So some people like Supermel Superfumo Vitality more.
[00:27:57.324 --> 00:28:03.409]  Alpha Power is amazing and it costs a fraction of what Supermel and Superfumo do.
[00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:05.090]  But right now they're 50% off.

[00:28:35.824 --> 00:28:36.905]  That's my plug for the hour.
[00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:38.046]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:28:38.146 --> 00:28:41.088]  Please promote our local radio affiliates.
[00:28:41.188 --> 00:28:50.053]  It is so vital that if you're listening to us in California or Texas or New York, however you're listening, remember, you're the only person that can get past the censors.
[00:28:50.734 --> 00:28:57.538]  So tell people about that local radio station, about that local TV station, and tell folks about their local URL as well.
[00:28:58.139 --> 00:28:59.720]  Word of mouth is king in this fight.
[00:29:09.451 --> 00:29:12.372]  What do you want to do with your life?
[00:29:13.092 --> 00:29:13.932]  I want to rock!
[00:29:14.632 --> 00:29:21.513]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're going to see some serious s***.
[00:29:22.013 --> 00:29:28.474]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[00:29:29.174 --> 00:29:29.314]  Shots.
[00:29:33.988 --> 00:29:38.432]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not phased by gun control laws.
[00:29:39.593 --> 00:29:46.179]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[00:29:46.479 --> 00:29:54.846]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[00:29:54.866 --> 00:29:57.669]  All right, what is the trilateral connection?
[00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.932]  Of an organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[00:30:02.032 --> 00:30:10.458]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[00:30:10.478 --> 00:30:16.002]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:21.626]  And, in time, bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:39.726]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[00:30:39.986 --> 00:30:46.592]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[00:30:46.912 --> 00:30:48.033]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[00:30:48.294 --> 00:30:52.939]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[00:30:53.059 --> 00:30:57.684]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[00:30:58.575 --> 00:31:03.258]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[00:31:03.558 --> 00:31:07.721]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:10.563]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[00:31:10.623 --> 00:31:18.408]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[00:31:18.428 --> 00:31:22.671]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[00:31:22.731 --> 00:31:28.375]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed its ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[00:31:29.476 --> 00:31:30.616]  I'm scared of these people.
[00:31:31.317 --> 00:31:33.679]  I'm very scared of them.
[00:31:34.139 --> 00:31:40.764]  How do you think the crack drop gets into the country?
[00:31:40.784 --> 00:31:42.185]  We don't own any planes.
[00:31:42.645 --> 00:31:43.726]  We don't own no ships.
[00:31:43.986 --> 00:31:47.309]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[00:31:47.569 --> 00:31:54.234]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[00:31:56.594 --> 00:32:03.780]  Men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.804]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:15.930]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small airbase at Mena, Arkansas.
[00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:23.176]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-contras
[00:32:23.736 --> 00:32:28.920]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[00:32:29.721 --> 00:32:35.645]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[00:32:36.225 --> 00:32:41.229]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[00:32:41.449 --> 00:32:44.611]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[00:32:45.152 --> 00:32:47.774]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[00:32:48.494 --> 00:32:52.798]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[00:32:52.818 --> 00:32:53.099]  Lewinsky.
[00:32:53.639 --> 00:32:55.581]  These allegations are false.
[00:32:56.482 --> 00:33:02.427]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[00:33:06.371 --> 00:33:09.034]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:20.425 --> 00:33:21.205]  Big Brother.
[00:33:22.526 --> 00:33:23.786]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:24.827 --> 00:33:26.428]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:27.888 --> 00:33:28.869]  You want answers?
[00:33:29.829 --> 00:33:30.809]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:38.033]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:51.855 --> 00:33:54.117]  This country is fighting for its life.
[00:33:54.677 --> 00:33:56.759]  So is every other nation on this planet.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.063]  Many nations are run by horrible communist dictatorships like Venezuela and North Korea and aren't worth fighting for.
[00:34:02.083 --> 00:34:04.945]  Because they're corrupt beyond imagination.
[00:34:04.965 --> 00:34:09.869]  But still, you want the people to be free and you hope they can get out from under the strangling weight of the evil.
[00:34:12.451 --> 00:34:19.177]  But you look at America and its history and all of our resources and our cultural ideals and how it's under attack scientifically.
[00:34:20.785 --> 00:34:31.134]  It's worth fighting for, and it should be easy to promote freedom and sovereignty and financial opportunity that this country affords like no other.
[00:34:33.016 --> 00:34:44.025]  But instead, there's been a clear brainwashing, especially in the schools and universities, primary and secondary learning, to absolutely hate this country.
[00:34:44.105 --> 00:34:46.588]  And it's undeniable now, and it's the main
[00:34:48.223 --> 00:34:50.124]  Cultural ethos.
[00:34:50.785 --> 00:34:54.507]  It is the main driving hymnal.
[00:34:55.148 --> 00:34:56.028]  It is the textbook.
[00:34:56.088 --> 00:34:56.889]  It is the blueprint.
[00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:57.809]  It is the roadmap.
[00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:05.455]  It is the compendium of their spirit to hate this nation.
[00:35:10.338 --> 00:35:11.699]  And when you come to that realization,
[00:35:13.289 --> 00:35:16.690]  I grew up, and I've talked about this a lot, I'm going to get to France right now.
[00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:36.134]  I grew up getting so sick of hearing about how great Texas was, and pulling up at family members' houses, and Texas flags all over the place, and everybody got their guns out shooting them, and they're never going to get our guns.
[00:35:36.194 --> 00:35:37.754]  And I like shooting the guns, don't get me wrong.
[00:35:37.834 --> 00:35:42.055]  I just as a kid thought, come on, this is a form of arrogance.
[00:35:43.035 --> 00:35:45.637]  This is a form of, uh, elitism?
[00:35:47.158 --> 00:35:48.939]  And then later I learned it was not that at all.
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:36:08.673]  These people had all been in the military, or they'd all worked overseas, and they'd all been through the system, and they all knew, even then, there were people in our government, in Armenia, and in our universities that hated this country, and they understood the danger, and were always telling me about the danger, and so as soon as I grew up and experienced it in high school and college, I knew they were right!
[00:36:10.452 --> 00:36:12.893]  And I was like, why weren't you more on my ass?
[00:36:13.333 --> 00:36:14.854]  Good God, this is horrible!
[00:36:15.495 --> 00:36:16.715]  This is out of control!
[00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.136]  This is dangerous!
[00:36:21.558 --> 00:36:23.739]  And now I care so much, it just tortures the hell out of me.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:33.044]  And I look at these slobs that don't care, and I just, sometimes I envy them because they have no idea how much danger they and their families are in and how bad things have gotten.
[00:36:34.864 --> 00:36:36.125]  But things are good, too.
[00:36:36.205 --> 00:36:37.766]  People all over the world are waking up.
[00:36:37.866 --> 00:36:39.327]  I cannot overstate
[00:36:40.342 --> 00:36:51.911]  You know, every election, except ours three weeks ago, every election globally, unless it's Venezuela or the U.S., where there was total election fraud.
[00:36:51.931 --> 00:36:53.152]  And we know there was.
[00:36:53.212 --> 00:36:56.715]  We know that Trump won this referendum.
[00:36:56.955 --> 00:36:57.976]  People see right through it.
[00:36:58.016 --> 00:36:59.177]  All the internal polls show it.
[00:36:59.898 --> 00:37:03.721]  Trump's got double the polls Macron's got, but the press is praising Macron.
[00:37:05.902 --> 00:37:07.564]  And in Brazil,
[00:37:09.173 --> 00:37:21.643]  And in Chile, and in Greece, and in Spain, and in Catalonia, and in Italy, and in Germany, and in England, and in Scotland, and in Ireland, and UK-wide.
[00:37:22.864 --> 00:37:23.305]  Everywhere!
[00:37:24.946 --> 00:37:32.032]  The socialists are now going, wait a minute, we're going to bring in tens of millions of people to be on welfare, to be a client group?
[00:37:33.672 --> 00:37:39.375]  And you're going to take my pension fund and suddenly the socialists everywhere are joining the nationalist right-wingers.
[00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:41.556]  Game over.
[00:37:42.497 --> 00:37:45.659]  Because they were really socialists and really believed in socialism.
[00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:50.742]  They weren't Germany haters.
[00:37:50.802 --> 00:37:52.042]  They weren't French haters.
[00:37:52.423 --> 00:37:54.544]  They weren't Brazil haters.
[00:37:55.945 --> 00:37:57.185]  They weren't Spain haters.
[00:37:57.225 --> 00:37:58.286]  They weren't Italy haters.
[00:38:01.604 --> 00:38:06.127]  They just bought into the whole thing of the, you know, social net or whatever.
[00:38:06.587 --> 00:38:07.647]  It's then been exploited.
[00:38:08.008 --> 00:38:11.790]  And so now, coalition governments have formed.
[00:38:13.631 --> 00:38:14.832]  You know who's on the side?
[00:38:16.793 --> 00:38:17.213]  In England.
[00:38:19.154 --> 00:38:22.196]  It's the lefties that want to not be bankrupted with the right wingers.
[00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:25.658]  Then there's the big establishment right and establishment left that are together.
[00:38:27.065 --> 00:38:31.588]  And you don't help the poorest parts of Africa bringing the worst in, brainwashed by Islam.
[00:38:31.848 --> 00:38:36.272]  You don't help the worst parts of the Middle East bringing them in and then having them make you adopt their system.
[00:38:36.292 --> 00:38:36.852]  That's what happens.
[00:38:37.292 --> 00:38:40.254]  You know, just five years ago they would deny that there were no-go zones.
[00:38:41.375 --> 00:38:42.356]  Hell, just three years ago.
[00:38:42.656 --> 00:38:44.978]  We would send reporters to Paris.
[00:38:45.938 --> 00:38:51.882]  We would send reporters to other areas of Europe and they would go into the no-go zones and show it.
[00:38:52.683 --> 00:38:53.644]  Now, they don't even deny it.
[00:38:54.364 --> 00:38:56.246]  Thousands of no-go zones in
[00:38:57.443 --> 00:38:57.803]  France.
[00:38:57.963 --> 00:38:59.865]  Thousands of no-go zones in Sweden.
[00:39:00.205 --> 00:39:06.690]  I mean, whole areas of cities, large parts of cities, where there's not even plumbers going into them.
[00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.611]  The fire departments won't go in.
[00:39:08.811 --> 00:39:10.052]  There's no mail delivery.
[00:39:10.392 --> 00:39:11.453]  That's all over the news now.
[00:39:13.855 --> 00:39:16.316]  Because Islamic gangs will kill you.
[00:39:16.536 --> 00:39:17.777]  They've got hand grenades.
[00:39:17.817 --> 00:39:19.218]  They've got AK-47s.
[00:39:19.298 --> 00:39:21.460]  Those are all illegal in Sweden.
[00:39:23.001 --> 00:39:24.382]  Those are all illegal in Germany.
[00:39:26.932 --> 00:39:30.793]  It's harder to get a gun in Germany than almost anywhere in the world.
[00:39:34.115 --> 00:39:42.498]  So when we come back, I'm going to play some of the Macron clips, with him getting hit in the head with an egg, and Paris burning for three days, and the police joining with the demonstrators.
[00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:51.221]  Because these aren't your regular Islamic, you know, folks that never worked a day in their life wearing puma jumpsuits, running around, you know, raping women or whatever.
[00:39:52.605 --> 00:40:01.987]  This is the French people are done because he just raised their gasoline prices by the equivalent of 30%, or a dollar or so for us.
[00:40:02.427 --> 00:40:04.847]  It's already like five and a half, six dollars equivalent here.
[00:40:06.127 --> 00:40:07.108]  They're in euros and liters.
[00:40:07.588 --> 00:40:11.348]  So now it's over six dollars for carbon taxes to pay, guess who?
[00:40:11.628 --> 00:40:14.269]  The Rothschild Carbon Bank in London.
[00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:18.190]  And everybody knows he was a Rothschild sex toy at 13, literally.
[00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.710]  He was passed around as a sex toy.
[00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.192]  He comes from the main Rothschild bank from nowhere.
[00:40:23.212 --> 00:40:25.454]  I mean, he was like 15, you know.
[00:40:27.055 --> 00:40:35.622]  And so their sex toy is now going to take tens of billions of French dollars, euros, money, and give it to the Rothschilds.
[00:40:36.102 --> 00:40:37.363]  Al Gore is involved, all of it.
[00:40:38.264 --> 00:40:41.306]  And so the French are going crazy right now.
[00:40:41.446 --> 00:40:45.449]  And Macron has got a 20% approval rating, even in their fake polls.
[00:40:45.729 --> 00:40:47.631]  But he wears little designer outfits.
[00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:48.712]  He's a little boy toy.
[00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:54.474]  Imagine what the globalists think when they look at him and, like, half the old men on the stage have had sex with him.
[00:40:55.074 --> 00:40:58.857]  I mean, and again, it's not the fact that he was, you know, he's an abused person.
[00:40:59.337 --> 00:41:00.278]  Probably mind-controlled.
[00:41:01.279 --> 00:41:08.584]  But the issue is, is that, you know, this woman gets him at 13, gets him in high society by 14, high society, pedophile society.
[00:41:09.565 --> 00:41:10.206]  They admit this!
[00:41:11.806 --> 00:41:17.829]  And he wears his little designer suits and he walks up there, and this is some dude they bang the hell out of at orgies.
[00:41:17.989 --> 00:41:20.650]  I mean, this is their globalist joke.
[00:41:21.091 --> 00:41:22.331]  It's like Michael Obama.
[00:41:22.651 --> 00:41:24.072]  It's all a big joke in our face.
[00:41:24.993 --> 00:41:29.895]  And yes, I actually do believe what John Rivers said.
[00:41:30.015 --> 00:41:30.575]  I'm serious, folks.
[00:41:30.595 --> 00:41:31.796]  It's all about throwing it in our face.
[00:41:32.856 --> 00:41:37.659]  Let's talk about George Herbert Walker Bush, though, who lied to get us in the Iraq War and wanted a new world order.
[00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:39.680]  Let's talk about that monster.
[00:41:41.314 --> 00:41:48.539]  We have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new world order.
[00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:55.265]  A world where the rule of law, not the law of the jungle, governs the conduct of nations.
[00:41:55.665 --> 00:41:58.427]  Now we can see a new world coming into view.
[00:41:59.608 --> 00:42:03.531]  A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order.
[00:42:03.791 --> 00:42:06.713]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:42:07.174 --> 00:42:08.835]  They took the babies out of incubators.
[00:42:12.689 --> 00:42:23.618]  They had kids in incubators and they were thrown out of the incubators so that Kuwait could be systematically dismantled.
[00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:30.304]  Just two hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait.
[00:42:30.784 --> 00:42:35.989]  Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations, was crushed.
[00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:38.271]  Its people brutalized.
[00:42:39.229 --> 00:42:42.730]  Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war.
[00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:43.691]  Because you told him to.
[00:42:44.491 --> 00:42:47.032]  Tonight, the battle has been joined.
[00:42:51.854 --> 00:42:56.156]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.

[00:44:59.474 --> 00:45:01.415]  Again, you are the resistance.
[00:45:04.878 --> 00:45:07.059]  Chase the Patriot from California.
[00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.000]  Hello Alex.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.581]  Chase, welcome to the airwaves.
[00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:12.402]  This is Chase the Patriot from the front lines of California.
[00:45:12.462 --> 00:45:15.624]  So, I took your reporter challenge on YouTube, Chase the Patriot.
[00:45:15.664 --> 00:45:18.626]  I've been filing reports every single day, but I've noticed a trend.
[00:45:18.726 --> 00:45:21.488]  And there's this false confidence of the Democrats again.
[00:45:21.528 --> 00:45:23.149]  The same thing we saw in the 2016 election.
[00:45:23.189 --> 00:45:23.809]  So it's up to us.
[00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.690]  We're good to go.
[00:45:46.007 --> 00:45:46.668]  Oh, absolutely!
[00:45:46.708 --> 00:45:48.951]  When I say these shirts are like choose your own adventure.
[00:45:49.411 --> 00:45:52.735]  Wear a mohawn labe, you'll only meet fellow patriots and gun owners, which is great.
[00:45:52.855 --> 00:45:58.002]  Wear a, you know, big obnoxious InfoWars shirt in red or a Trump pinch shirt, you're gonna meet your friends and your enemies.
[00:45:58.042 --> 00:46:02.127]  So it's a really great way to spread the word and exercise free speech in the third dimension.
[00:46:02.227 --> 00:46:04.588]  Hey, and one more suggestion on that.
[00:46:04.668 --> 00:46:20.036]  You know, a lot of us have, we might have, I don't want to give away anything, but some of us might have a concealed carry, and I would like to see a button-up shirt long enough that I can wear untouched so I can still carry on my hip a pistol, and that's something if you put like a little American flag on the armband.
[00:46:20.056 --> 00:46:21.316]  Oh, it's total genius.
[00:46:21.357 --> 00:46:25.439]  The Info Wars, the Info Wars concealed carry shirt for men and women.
[00:46:25.519 --> 00:46:29.541]  Kind of like a cargo shirt, or like a bowling shirt, or like a...
[00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:36.502]  A utility shirt, and it's got an American flag, it's black, and it's got that, you know, it's not tapered, it kind of flanks out.
[00:46:36.722 --> 00:46:37.362]  That's perfect.
[00:46:37.382 --> 00:46:41.323]  Yeah, and you know, something you can wear to the office and nobody really knows what's going on.
[00:46:41.423 --> 00:46:43.744]  It just looks like a normal shirt they got from the mall.
[00:46:43.784 --> 00:46:47.104]  But if you can support the cause, you know, if somebody asks, hey, where'd you get that shirt?
[00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.225]  It'll say Infowars.com on the inside.
[00:46:49.425 --> 00:46:50.065]  Absolutely.
[00:46:50.085 --> 00:46:50.945]  We need to branch out.
[00:46:50.965 --> 00:46:53.346]  We've got so many great t-shirts, so many for men and women.
[00:46:53.666 --> 00:46:54.946]  Ball caps, I don't even promote them anymore.
[00:46:54.986 --> 00:46:58.127]  We've got the best shirts we've ever had, and that's something I never even talk about.
[00:46:58.427 --> 00:46:59.407]  So thanks for calling, Chase.
[00:46:59.427 --> 00:46:59.887]  God bless you.
[00:47:06.457 --> 00:47:09.181]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.527 --> 00:47:19.614]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:36.295 --> 00:47:45.039]  Everybody knows that for two years plus, I have not wanted to cover the Russiagate thing, even though I've been in the middle of it, because it's absolute, total BS.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.421]  It'd be like if I wanted to talk about Snow White and the Seven Dwarves for two years.
[00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:51.182]  I mean, it would get really old really fast.
[00:47:52.743 --> 00:48:00.687]  People ask me like, you know, you're on the news all the time being implicated working for Russia, and I'm just like, it'd be like if I was implicated working for the Chinese or something, or Martians.
[00:48:02.356 --> 00:48:03.616]  What it does is make me angry.
[00:48:03.696 --> 00:48:13.059]  Every time I see Robert Mueller, I mean, it's just... It wouldn't be so bad if he was just corrupt trying to set me up because I'm a political winner, because we beat their butt politically.
[00:48:13.579 --> 00:48:23.082]  If he wasn't the actual traitor of the Russians... That's what really gets in my... It's under my saddle, folks.
[00:48:30.919 --> 00:48:36.124]  That's not a good place to be, so I get exhausted later and can't finish my work throughout the day.
[00:48:37.725 --> 00:48:38.566]  Anger is on our friend.
[00:48:38.966 --> 00:48:40.227]  At least, not normally.
[00:48:41.769 --> 00:48:42.910]  Let me get focused again, excuse me.
[00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:44.171]  I'm starting to get angry again.
[00:48:44.957 --> 00:48:48.019]  Because let me tell you, they're trying to destroy my life with this Russia crap behind the scenes.
[00:48:48.059 --> 00:48:58.304]  They've put it... I have a perfect banking score, and they've got this secret Homeland Security designation that is going to have to be removed once this whole fake investigation is over.
[00:48:58.324 --> 00:49:04.267]  That's how they started taking our banks away and stuff, is they put some Interpol crime watch thing on me.
[00:49:05.228 --> 00:49:08.810]  Our little friends in the deep state, when they're the criminals, just, oh!
[00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:11.331]  But hey, that's the global social score.
[00:49:11.391 --> 00:49:12.892]  It's coming for all of us, man!
[00:49:12.912 --> 00:49:14.333]  We've got to say no to this!
[00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:19.336]  People say, well, I'll just roll over to it and then they'll leave me alone.
[00:49:22.379 --> 00:49:23.880]  No, then they'll get you for sure.
[00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:27.703]  We've got to have the instinct to fight back against this crap.
[00:49:28.204 --> 00:49:28.904]  But I'm digressing.
[00:49:31.066 --> 00:49:32.127]  Please don't show me, Brennan.
[00:49:32.167 --> 00:49:33.348]  He makes me even madder than Mueller.
[00:49:33.609 --> 00:49:33.949]  Please.
[00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.032]  They're such deep state jerks, man.
[00:49:38.328 --> 00:49:46.330]  Brennan was in the Communist Party and voted for the Communists twice, and says he's still a Communist, and then is a Wahhabist who joined Islam?
[00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:53.871]  I mean, you imagine the type of America hater you've got to be for Obama, for you to be Obama's favorite person.
[00:49:55.011 --> 00:49:57.532]  What type of sick cult are these people from?
[00:49:58.532 --> 00:50:00.633]  But again, they've all got inferiority complexes.
[00:50:01.693 --> 00:50:03.153]  Obama, Brennan, Mueller.
[00:50:03.513 --> 00:50:07.434]  If they can dominate America, and crush it,
[00:50:09.417 --> 00:50:15.402]  It's like these guys that get trophy wives and then like treat them really bad and dominate them and it's like a power trip how they treat their wives like such crap.
[00:50:15.442 --> 00:50:16.243]  I see it all the time.
[00:50:16.803 --> 00:50:18.965]  And it's like you want to slap them upside the head.
[00:50:19.005 --> 00:50:20.366]  It just gets so old, man.
[00:50:20.847 --> 00:50:21.467]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:50:21.607 --> 00:50:22.628]  I'm not your bitch!
[00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.191]  You traitorous garbage.
[00:50:28.233 --> 00:50:30.575]  Bunch of scum strutting around acting powerful all day.
[00:50:30.815 --> 00:50:31.336]  Sick of you.
[00:50:31.716 --> 00:50:34.659]  And America will get this disease out of our bloodstream.
[00:50:35.179 --> 00:50:35.840]  One way or another.
[00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:37.522]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:50:38.262 --> 00:51:00.936]  I meant to just say, I normally don't get into the Russia thing because it's a bunch of bull, but lately I have been because it's all coming to a big, disgusting head, and Roger Stone will be joining us because there have been some very large developments that just, look at the whole battle in the deep state itself, not just the fake Russia story, but all the fake spying, all the crimes they've committed, Trump taking the gloves off, there's been some huge developments on that front that we'll be looking at.
[00:51:01.713 --> 00:51:03.434]  I will never testify against Trump.
[00:51:03.614 --> 00:51:13.021]  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President Trump.
[00:51:13.401 --> 00:51:14.903]  Nice to know that some people still have guts.
[00:51:15.823 --> 00:51:16.744]  That's the president today.
[00:51:18.665 --> 00:51:25.230]  And we're going to tie that into Mueller withheld details that would exonerate the president of having Kremlin back channel.
[00:51:28.792 --> 00:51:32.915]  It's normal for a candidate to have some type of back channel if they're the nominee.
[00:51:32.935 --> 00:51:33.716]  It's not illegal.
[00:51:34.256 --> 00:51:34.957]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:51:34.977 --> 00:51:40.301]  They just act like... If Trump even ever shakes hands with Putin, now that he's president, he's... OH MY GOD!
[00:51:40.321 --> 00:51:40.761]  YOU SAW HIM!
[00:51:40.801 --> 00:51:41.382]  HE SHOOK HANDS!
[00:51:41.562 --> 00:51:42.102]  GOOD GOD!
[00:51:42.242 --> 00:51:43.683]  DON'T LET HIM TALK ALONE IN A ROOM!
[00:51:43.723 --> 00:51:44.404]  IT'S TREASON!
[00:51:45.284 --> 00:51:47.126]  Trump is his own branch of government!
[00:51:49.308 --> 00:51:53.731]  He can do whatever he wants, and if we think it's treasonous, then we've got to have an impeachment.
[00:51:55.845 --> 00:51:56.405]  I actually think
[00:52:14.679 --> 00:52:18.700]  Maybe a quarter of a percent, half a percent might have been needed because things were starting to really grow fast.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.782]  They've been too low for a while, but they only did that to prop up for Obama and to give the big banks their own free money.
[00:52:24.102 --> 00:52:25.383]  That money wouldn't go into the general public.
[00:52:25.963 --> 00:52:28.544]  Well, now they've had seven raises.
[00:52:28.564 --> 00:52:29.664]  They're talking about five more.
[00:52:30.224 --> 00:52:31.645]  That is hurting the economy.
[00:52:31.925 --> 00:52:35.666]  And then they're talking down the economy to purposely kill it to make Trump look bad.
[00:52:35.886 --> 00:52:37.807]  And that's called economic sabotage.
[00:52:38.407 --> 00:52:39.167]  It's called warfare.
[00:52:40.408 --> 00:52:43.329]  And that ties into Macron and all of this because
[00:52:47.986 --> 00:52:52.730]  The French, what was it, seven, eight years ago, raised income tax on the middle class to 101%.
[00:52:53.551 --> 00:52:57.554]  And you say, wait a minute, how is it 101%?
[00:52:57.915 --> 00:53:07.082]  It actually clawed back old money that people saved, but then it turned out the EU heads and the French president at the time was paying no tax and was offshore.
[00:53:07.763 --> 00:53:09.924]  You go, that's so criminal, that's so brutal.
[00:53:10.585 --> 00:53:15.229]  Because everyone on the inside of the French globalist club does whatever they want.
[00:53:16.727 --> 00:53:20.149]  It's just anybody else that isn't part of the club, they come after you.
[00:53:20.189 --> 00:53:24.591]  What 101% tax means, if you aren't in the club, you're not doing business in France.
[00:53:24.991 --> 00:53:26.512]  And that's what carbon taxes are.
[00:53:27.073 --> 00:53:31.235]  These big companies get to waive them, or pay them to themselves, or do offsets.
[00:53:31.295 --> 00:53:32.275]  It's all scams.
[00:53:32.936 --> 00:53:35.537]  There's only four big global carbon trading groups.
[00:53:37.078 --> 00:53:42.561]  There's some sub ones, but Chicago, New York, London, Frankfurt, Tokyo,
[00:53:44.702 --> 00:53:51.344]  And these companies, owned by Al Gore and the Rothschilds and others, are set to make trillions of dollars!
[00:53:51.744 --> 00:53:55.325]  They have invested hundreds of billions of taxpayer money to prop it up!
[00:53:59.026 --> 00:53:59.626]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:54:00.166 --> 00:54:02.186]  Al Gore's 15 trillion carbon tax.
[00:54:02.206 --> 00:54:03.207]  That's just his proposal.
[00:54:04.047 --> 00:54:04.547]  To Congress.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.422]  I remember saying they won a carbon tax 15 years ago, 20 years ago, and they go, Jones is insane!
[00:54:11.682 --> 00:54:14.963]  He claims there's a plan for a world carbon tax and an EU army.
[00:54:15.283 --> 00:54:17.304]  He is dangerous and anti-Semitic!
[00:54:22.866 --> 00:54:26.848]  Now they're saying Benjamin Netanyahu's criticism of George Soros is anti-Semitic.
[00:54:27.068 --> 00:54:28.228]  No, I'm not kidding.
[00:54:28.248 --> 00:54:29.689]  I actually saw that last week.
[00:54:32.458 --> 00:54:37.139]  The guy that's anti-Israel and anti-Semitic is that evil creature George Soros.
[00:54:37.179 --> 00:54:42.920]  But hey, when you spend $33 billion in just a few years on propaganda, you can buy a lot of people!
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.821]  Guess who you can't buy?
[00:54:45.221 --> 00:54:45.461]  Me!
[00:54:49.942 --> 00:54:52.282]  And by the way, people like me built civilization.
[00:54:52.962 --> 00:54:56.103]  You know, used to, folks, any good civilization had some good people in it.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:54:59.040]  Who stand for something, you know?
[00:55:00.281 --> 00:55:01.501]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:11.983]  The fact that I'm not for sale, and a few other people aren't for sale, like people like Matt Drudge, Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:55:12.023 --> 00:55:14.364]  It's such a religion to attack Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:55:14.884 --> 00:55:16.964]  But Benjamin Netanyahu stands up for his country.
[00:55:17.624 --> 00:55:25.106]  And now he and his wife are being indicted, his wife's been indicted, for over years.
[00:55:26.505 --> 00:55:28.887]  Something like $100,000 is what it comes out to.
[00:55:29.587 --> 00:55:32.609]  Having the government pay for state dinners at their house.
[00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.411]  They don't even have a White House.
[00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.053]  Israel is so frugal with their government.
[00:55:37.653 --> 00:55:41.036]  They're so underscored, which I think is classy.
[00:55:42.296 --> 00:55:43.317]  The uniforms, all of it.
[00:55:43.337 --> 00:55:44.918]  The architecture is very understated.
[00:55:47.631 --> 00:55:50.114]  A hundred thousand dollars over, was it four years?
[00:55:50.835 --> 00:55:52.417]  Of chefs and food?
[00:55:52.697 --> 00:55:53.859]  To have world leaders visit?
[00:55:54.219 --> 00:55:55.000]  At his house?
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.101]  That's where they eat?
[00:55:56.362 --> 00:55:57.403]  And that's the crime?
[00:55:58.024 --> 00:55:58.605]  Is food?
[00:56:00.293 --> 00:56:02.674]  And again, I'm proud to defend Netanyahu.
[00:56:03.055 --> 00:56:11.239]  He's got his own problems, he's done corrupt stuff, all sorts of things, in wars and deals and even worked, you know, in the fight with Syria, and I thought that was wrong.
[00:56:11.699 --> 00:56:20.424]  But he's under attack by the globalists, he's under attack by Soros, that means the Rothschilds, because they want Israel for their grand design, and they want to break it up.
[00:56:20.704 --> 00:56:25.287]  Just like they want to break up America, just like they want to break up Spain, like they want to break up Japan.
[00:56:25.527 --> 00:56:29.629]  They want to break all our countries up to dominate us, and I'm sick of it!
[00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:32.930]  It's evil!
[00:56:33.971 --> 00:56:43.040]  To all the crazy people that hate Jews and make it their religion to hate them on the left and right, celebrating Netanyahu or Trump getting in trouble, you're idiots!
[00:56:43.621 --> 00:56:48.226]  The whole evil global media combine is trying to destroy
[00:56:49.361 --> 00:56:50.542]  Any sovereign country.
[00:56:50.562 --> 00:56:51.743]  Does that mean Putin's perfect?
[00:56:51.804 --> 00:56:52.004]  No!
[00:56:52.244 --> 00:56:59.251]  But I admire him because he runs his country and stands up for his own people and is going against the grain and has the whole world coming after him.
[00:57:00.032 --> 00:57:03.034]  And that's the globalist big fear, is that countries like the UK,
[00:57:04.605 --> 00:57:25.760]  And the US, and Israel, and Russia, and Japan, and South Korea, who want to have open, free societies, who want to be free market, who want to live in peace, that we work together, because we'll out-produce and out-develop all the rest of these countries combined, and that's why we're under attack, and that's why they're trying to put Netanyahu in jail, and it's why they're trying to put me in jail, and it's why they're trying to put Trump in jail.
[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.921]  We're the men in the arena.
[00:57:28.962 --> 00:57:32.465]  They tried to kill Nigel Farage seven times till he just said it.
[00:57:33.205 --> 00:57:33.966]  My wife died.
[00:57:34.972 --> 00:57:42.899]  Running me off the road, cutting my brake lines, loosening my wheel things, trying to poison me, crashing airplanes on my ass, I'm done.
[00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.781]  You understand, folks, this is a war.
[00:57:45.682 --> 00:57:47.563]  It's a war between nations and the globalists.
[00:57:48.004 --> 00:57:48.464]  Period.
[00:57:48.744 --> 00:57:49.885]  Choose which side you're on.
[00:57:52.628 --> 00:57:59.074]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:58:00.782 --> 00:58:02.223]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:58:02.464 --> 00:58:07.408]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:14.515]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[00:58:15.276 --> 00:58:22.943]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[00:58:23.704 --> 00:58:26.985]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last.
[00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:31.526]  And what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt, but these are going to be selling out.
[00:58:31.686 --> 00:58:36.707]  So whatever you order that day, they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out.
[00:58:37.047 --> 00:58:40.188]  Then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders.
[00:58:40.248 --> 00:58:47.949]  So in the next 12 days, we are going to have, beyond any other sale we've ever had, the free gift.
[00:58:48.450 --> 00:58:49.850]  So this is a loss leader.
[00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:57.423]  We are losing money on this, but we're gonna help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[00:58:57.883 --> 00:58:59.624]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[00:58:59.684 --> 00:59:04.605]  I love my state, but if you got a business and a company here and you got merchandise, BS.
[00:59:05.065 --> 00:59:05.545]  It's big.
[00:59:06.125 --> 00:59:06.526]  It's bad.
[00:59:06.966 --> 00:59:12.187]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[00:59:12.207 --> 00:59:14.508]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[00:59:14.948 --> 00:59:18.149]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[00:59:18.769 --> 00:59:19.712]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:59:19.752 --> 00:59:20.916]  That's been going on for over a month.
[00:59:21.698 --> 00:59:22.922]  50 to 75% off.
[00:59:22.942 --> 00:59:23.945]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[00:59:25.014 --> 00:59:25.955]  The Double Patriot points.
[00:59:25.975 --> 00:59:26.875]  That's what happened in about a week.
[00:59:27.236 --> 00:59:33.881]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[00:59:34.321 --> 00:59:38.705]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:38.745 --> 00:59:40.626]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:59:40.866 --> 00:59:42.688]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:59:42.888 --> 00:59:44.930]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:45.110 --> 00:59:49.133]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[00:59:55.020 --> 01:00:00.984]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:18.394]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:19.134 --> 01:00:21.015]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:29.132]  All right, Roger Stone's coming up with huge Russia news on so many fronts.
[01:00:29.212 --> 01:00:30.294]  And again, it's not just Russia.
[01:00:30.334 --> 01:00:31.435]  That's all BS.
[01:00:31.535 --> 01:00:38.685]  But the fake investigation, the attempt to overthrow the election, the deep state war, Trump getting ready to take the gloves off, that's all very, very real.
[01:00:38.705 --> 01:00:41.228]  So that's coming up exclusively next segment.
[01:00:43.188 --> 01:00:45.769]  Trump has tweeted, you know, thank God there's still men with guts out there.
[01:00:46.929 --> 01:00:50.590]  And I tell you, I'm gonna stop right there.
[01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:55.291]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:00:55.331 --> 01:00:57.412]  I wish I could tell you everything I know, but I can't.
[01:00:58.732 --> 01:01:00.953]  Let me get just a few of these clips I mentioned because I talked about them.
[01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:03.673]  We'll play some of these with audio.
[01:01:03.713 --> 01:01:07.854]  The original one, then we've got a joke one with Trump throwing an opening pitch at a baseball game.
[01:01:08.234 --> 01:01:09.735]  It's Macron getting hit in the head with an egg.
[01:01:10.854 --> 01:01:12.816]  Now, Macron is the ultimate puppet.
[01:01:13.016 --> 01:01:15.278]  Sexually abused as a child, brainwashed.
[01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:16.499]  This is all on record.
[01:01:17.539 --> 01:01:24.345]  And this little, you know, doll that they put in little outfits that his wife dresses up, that rolls out and then sells the country out to carbon taxes.
[01:01:24.785 --> 01:01:35.694]  He is the definition of a globalist traitor, flooding their country with radical jihadis, stealing people's pension funds, raising giant carbon taxes to pay the Rothschilds and Al Gore.
[01:01:36.094 --> 01:01:38.136]  I mean, we're talking an absolute piece of garbage.
[01:01:40.445 --> 01:01:42.886]  And now they've had three days of huge riots.
[01:01:44.186 --> 01:01:45.626]  And it's getting crazier and crazier.
[01:01:46.246 --> 01:01:47.847]  And he's just on the verge of total collapse.
[01:01:47.907 --> 01:01:50.027]  So, he just got in a year and a half ago.
[01:01:50.087 --> 01:01:51.468]  He was supposed to be the God-man.
[01:01:52.008 --> 01:01:55.328]  But now, oh, he put his head down like he put his head down to mommy's breast.
[01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:56.649]  He got so scared.
[01:01:56.769 --> 01:01:58.289]  So let's roll this again at full speed.
[01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:00.049]  Here it is for TV viewers.
[01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.970]  And then we've got some of the footage of the riots going on.
[01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:05.651]  We can roll some of that for folks.
[01:02:05.771 --> 01:02:06.711]  Let's go ahead and roll some of that.
[01:02:09.522 --> 01:02:11.943]  They're very busy trying to get all this off the walls.
[01:02:11.963 --> 01:02:18.386]  This is not Islamacist burning random citizens' cars or raping women or burning down citizens' homes.
[01:02:18.426 --> 01:02:23.008]  They were burning down government buildings and posh, elite, globalist shops.
[01:02:24.088 --> 01:02:28.930]  And, you know, I'm not calling for violence, but if you're going to do stuff like that, that's what you really ought to do.
[01:02:30.391 --> 01:02:31.672]  Don't need to burn the police cars.
[01:02:31.692 --> 01:02:36.594]  You need to burn the globalist cars, the bankers' cars, the liberals' cars.
[01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:39.561]  Somebody got a Beato sticker on their car.
[01:02:39.701 --> 01:02:40.381]  I would never do this.
[01:02:40.401 --> 01:02:41.843]  I'm not saying burn their car down.
[01:02:42.243 --> 01:02:47.108]  I'm saying it's the left and the idiots that run around indiscriminately hit women on the head with bike locks.
[01:02:47.528 --> 01:02:48.309]  They're gonna riot.
[01:02:48.929 --> 01:02:50.831]  You might as well go around it.
[01:02:51.191 --> 01:02:53.213]  By the way, let's roll the footage for TV viewers.
[01:02:53.253 --> 01:02:54.234]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[01:02:54.715 --> 01:02:55.475]  And we're simulcast.
[01:02:56.156 --> 01:03:02.322]  We have the police in at least two different cases caught on video taking their helmets off and joining the yellow-vested demonstrators.
[01:03:04.063 --> 01:03:08.727]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, they're talking about calling the military out, but the military is even more pissed than the police.
[01:03:10.209 --> 01:03:18.036]  So they did, you know, some show here where the police fired a few tear gas rounds after they were threatened with arrest to try to clear the square.
[01:03:25.443 --> 01:03:28.645]  Again, the article is on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:03:30.785 --> 01:03:34.187]  Or they take their helmets off in solidarity with the actual French people.
[01:03:36.009 --> 01:03:44.174]  Not with the 5 million illegal aliens that have been brought in who 80 plus percent of the illegal aliens brought in the last decade are on welfare in Germany and France.
[01:03:44.895 --> 01:03:46.216]  It's 90 percent in Sweden.
[01:03:46.636 --> 01:03:50.158]  Here it's only 63 percent in a new poll.
[01:03:50.178 --> 01:03:52.960]  Not a new poll, a new census.
[01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:54.481]  Census confirms U.S.
[01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:54.822]  Census.
[01:03:57.001 --> 01:04:02.827]  63% of non-citizens on welfare, 4.6 million households, an average household being six people!
[01:04:03.848 --> 01:04:05.089]  Isn't that just darling?
[01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:14.419]  See, when you got here, whether it was on the Mayflower or Ellis Island in the last 400 years, that no one was shoving a silver spoon in your mouth at a bunch of welfare.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.704]  In fact, you were dodging arrows most of the time.
[01:04:19.775 --> 01:04:21.418]  Then everybody lionizes the Native Americans.
[01:04:21.478 --> 01:04:26.168]  If you wouldn't fight the local Native American group with the group you were with, they would kill you.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.962]  And of course, you know, anybody who's been out West and has ancestors in the West is related to Native Americans.
[01:04:32.982 --> 01:04:38.725]  Because a lot of times your wife died, there weren't any other women around, and you know, the Native women were pretty darn nice.
[01:04:38.785 --> 01:04:45.788]  And so my whole family trio on my daddy's side is all, you know, hopped up with the Native Americans.
[01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:48.289]  That's a good thing, but I don't sit there and wear like some badge of honor.
[01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:49.690]  I'm proud of all of my genetic background.
[01:04:50.030 --> 01:04:52.992]  But I can tell you as someone who studied history and who has got
[01:04:54.433 --> 01:04:58.736]  Some of the most vicious Native American bloodline there is, that they were not very nice people.
[01:04:59.237 --> 01:05:00.318]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:05:03.928 --> 01:05:06.949]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[01:05:07.210 --> 01:05:07.470]  Go ahead.
[01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:13.293]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:05:13.513 --> 01:05:14.633]  I'd done the War Room.
[01:05:14.913 --> 01:05:17.374]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:05:17.394 --> 01:05:18.935]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:05:18.995 --> 01:05:19.616]  I was exhausted.
[01:05:19.936 --> 01:05:23.197]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[01:05:23.537 --> 01:05:28.180]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.301]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:30.321 --> 01:05:30.961]  The same thing.
[01:05:31.001 --> 01:05:33.102]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at Infowars.
[01:05:33.182 --> 01:05:34.423]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:05:34.583 --> 01:05:36.445]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:05:36.705 --> 01:05:42.709]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:43.850]  You can sleep with it.
[01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:48.453]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:05:48.513 --> 01:05:51.315]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:05:51.475 --> 01:05:53.176]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:05:53.276 --> 01:05:53.976]  It really works.
[01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:58.719]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:06:05.548 --> 01:06:08.752]  Believe me.
[01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:14.481]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:24.833 --> 01:07:26.014]  Guys, I apologize.
[01:07:26.554 --> 01:07:33.377]  I've been sitting there for a couple minutes talking to Roger Stone during the break about huge behind-the-scenes inside baseball, and I looked up and went, wow, we're a minute into the show.
[01:07:33.877 --> 01:07:34.597]  I apologize.
[01:07:34.657 --> 01:07:36.898]  I was not disregarding you in an arrogant way.
[01:07:36.958 --> 01:07:39.459]  I was just being blown away by what Roger was telling me.
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.960]  There's a lot to cover here.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:46.122]  Trump wants Ratt locked up a long time.
[01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:51.612]  And we're going to be getting to that story from DrugsReport.com.
[01:07:51.672 --> 01:07:54.274]  Trump wants rat locked up for a long time.
[01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:55.154]  That's Michael Cohen.
[01:07:56.235 --> 01:07:59.918]  But for every rat, there is the anti-rat.
[01:08:00.498 --> 01:08:03.640]  And we have Trump's tweet here.
[01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.523]  I will never testify against Trump, close quote.
[01:08:07.563 --> 01:08:08.783]  We'll play that clip in a few minutes.
[01:08:09.324 --> 01:08:11.065]  When he was on with Stephanopoulos, that's Roger Stone.
[01:08:11.725 --> 01:08:15.368]  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be
[01:08:17.133 --> 01:08:23.056]  Forced by a rogue and out-of-control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President Trump.
[01:08:23.116 --> 01:08:26.137]  Nice to know that some people still have guts.
[01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:29.178]  And let me just tell the establishment something.
[01:08:31.699 --> 01:08:35.621]  Trump already pays attention to what Roger says, but let's just say he's hyper-focused now.
[01:08:36.354 --> 01:08:39.655]  This is going to be very useful to us.
[01:08:40.715 --> 01:08:44.636]  Because you see, we're not trying to dodge your fake prison.
[01:08:45.217 --> 01:08:46.877]  We're not trying to dodge your bullets.
[01:08:47.817 --> 01:08:49.718]  Or the cars you have that try to run us off the road.
[01:08:51.398 --> 01:08:52.158]  Or any of that.
[01:08:52.359 --> 01:08:53.459]  We're trying to defeat you.
[01:08:54.511 --> 01:09:04.842]  And while they're busy worried about their fake Russia thing to discredit the election of two years ago, we're going to be worried about other things that are going to devastate the deep state.
[01:09:04.882 --> 01:09:08.827]  So don't think with our phones tapped you know what's going on, because you don't.
[01:09:09.387 --> 01:09:11.009]  All you get is disinfo over the phones.
[01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:15.253]  And I'm sure you idiots have already figured that out there, you traitors.
[01:09:16.141 --> 01:09:31.398]  But if Mueller and Hillary thought they'd give uranium to Russia, and Mueller would deliver illegal uranium on the tarmac in Russia directly to Putin, and that you'd get away with all your secret meetings with Putin, Hillary, and you thought you'd get away with the sellout of all that, you're not getting away with it.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.304]  And, word is, there's going to be some breaking Russia news.
[01:09:38.561 --> 01:09:38.921]  That's right.
[01:09:38.982 --> 01:09:42.205]  Putin doesn't really want to implicate himself, but that's what governments do.
[01:09:42.305 --> 01:09:43.967]  They buy people off.
[01:09:44.007 --> 01:09:46.230]  They try to get uranium stockpiles.
[01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:49.153]  I don't blame Russia trying to get traders to sell us out.
[01:09:49.654 --> 01:09:50.314]  I expect the U.S.
[01:09:50.334 --> 01:09:51.035]  to do that to Russia.
[01:09:51.496 --> 01:09:53.418]  It's what countries do for your interest.
[01:09:53.458 --> 01:09:56.401]  But there's so many wheels in motion now.
[01:09:57.518 --> 01:10:04.647]  And Trump has announced he's gonna go after him for treason charges and so everyone should just be beside themselves right now with anticipation.
[01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:08.613]  But Roger Stone, we also have Mueller withheld details that would
[01:10:10.154 --> 01:10:12.775]  Exonerate the President of having Kremlin back-channel.
[01:10:12.795 --> 01:10:14.095]  We'll get to that next segment.
[01:10:14.795 --> 01:10:20.017]  But I know you were taking a well-deserved nap because you have been doing hundreds of interviews the last four or five days.
[01:10:20.037 --> 01:10:21.378]  You just got back from New York and D.C.
[01:10:22.098 --> 01:10:24.338]  I've been calling you all morning about the President's tweet.
[01:10:24.358 --> 01:10:29.000]  I guess you just woke up right before you came on ten minutes ago and learned of the President.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.861]  That's pretty cool, man.
[01:10:31.101 --> 01:10:35.262]  But all you said was there is no Russia, there is no back-channel, there is no collusion.
[01:10:35.302 --> 01:10:38.283]  So I can't lie about the President because it doesn't exist.
[01:10:38.883 --> 01:10:45.326]  Unlike the rat, Cohen, who got busted money laundering 15 million shmoleys, which he pled guilty to.
[01:10:46.227 --> 01:10:48.188]  And so he's not very credible, is he, Roger?
[01:10:49.128 --> 01:10:50.009]  No, he really isn't.
[01:10:50.169 --> 01:10:53.431]  Alex, I must say that it's kind of overwhelming.
[01:10:53.731 --> 01:10:59.714]  All I did on ABC yesterday with George Stephanopoulos was to say what I've said previously.
[01:11:00.494 --> 01:11:02.215]  I'll never roll on Donald Trump.
[01:11:02.575 --> 01:11:07.158]  What I specifically said is I will not bear false witness against demeaning
[01:11:07.947 --> 01:11:10.409]  You can threaten me, whatever.
[01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:17.176]  I'm not going to make up lies about Donald Trump to get myself off the hook, which is what clearly Michael Cohen has done.
[01:11:17.236 --> 01:11:19.137]  Now, I don't need to get off the hook.
[01:11:19.197 --> 01:11:20.298]  I've done nothing wrong.
[01:11:20.839 --> 01:11:24.963]  Cohen has done some things wrong, and that's his problem, but it has nothing to do with the president.
[01:11:26.264 --> 01:11:28.125]  And no, I'm gratified now.
[01:11:28.206 --> 01:11:28.546]  I have
[01:11:29.528 --> 01:11:38.932]  You know, I have text messages from a number of left-wing media outlets who want to know whether the president's tweet constitutes witness tampering.
[01:11:39.732 --> 01:11:40.513]  I'm not a witness.
[01:11:40.693 --> 01:11:55.019]  I've never been contacted by Mr. Mueller or any other investigative body, so... Sure, they're just trying to find somebody who they can do a dragnet and find dirt for other things, and then in exchange for lying about you, they get off.
[01:11:56.493 --> 01:11:56.853]  Exactly.
[01:11:57.313 --> 01:12:02.677]  But the idea that this is somehow meant to change my attitude, I think my attitude is pretty clear.
[01:12:03.117 --> 01:12:06.599]  So I'm honored and gratified by the president's tweet.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:17.726]  I like being with a president who's created 4.2 million new jobs, who's revitalizing our economy, protecting our borders, and turning this nation away from globalism.
[01:12:18.266 --> 01:12:24.990]  I'm proud to be a friend of Donald Trump's for 40 years, and I'll be happy when this nonsense is over.
[01:12:26.112 --> 01:12:29.116]  But Alex, I've got to respectfully disagree with you on one thing.
[01:12:30.118 --> 01:12:34.485]  The Mueller effort is not about overturning the 2016 election.
[01:12:34.545 --> 01:12:35.687]  It's far bigger than that.
[01:12:36.408 --> 01:12:39.533]  It's about distracting from their own treason.
[01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.830]  Oh, I agree.
[01:13:08.579 --> 01:13:09.299]  No, I agree with you.
[01:13:09.399 --> 01:13:14.842]  It's about the deep state covering for the illegal spying they did, desperately, and then coming up empty.
[01:13:14.862 --> 01:13:16.162]  They're totally desperate now.
[01:13:16.883 --> 01:13:27.767]  And the fact the Federal Reserve, it's private, is trying to derail the economy on top of it, and Hollywood is celebrating the economy going down, the public that I know is getting really pissed, Roger.
[01:13:28.868 --> 01:13:30.449]  I think people are very angry.
[01:13:30.569 --> 01:13:35.551]  And let's remember, the president has the authority to move ahead on those treason
[01:13:37.406 --> 01:13:42.949]  The real question, the one that bothers me more than anything, is FBI Director Christopher Wray.
[01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:46.572]  Does he work for Donald Trump or does he work for Robert Mueller?
[01:13:47.092 --> 01:13:59.039]  Because these raids on the whistleblower in Uranium One, essentially Mueller trying to grab the evidence of his own criminality as quickly as he can, who ordered that?
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.381]  And the judge who ordered it,
[01:14:02.381 --> 01:14:04.403]  Should be sanctioned because she broke the law.
[01:14:04.503 --> 01:14:06.245]  He was a protected whistleblower.
[01:14:07.105 --> 01:14:10.088]  But I would say the FBI director has some answering to do.
[01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:11.329]  Who does he work for?
[01:14:11.349 --> 01:14:12.671]  Mueller or the President?
[01:14:14.722 --> 01:14:17.885]  We didn't just start saying this once you're under investigation.
[01:14:17.905 --> 01:14:18.886]  I'm under investigation.
[01:14:18.906 --> 01:14:20.067]  They're having congressional hearings.
[01:14:20.528 --> 01:14:23.871]  Armed Services Committee saying I'm a Russian agent with no proof given.
[01:14:23.891 --> 01:14:26.393]  I mean, since when do you not... A, they don't show proof.
[01:14:26.453 --> 01:14:27.234]  B, I'm not there.
[01:14:27.314 --> 01:14:29.036]  I demand to be in front of these hearings.
[01:14:29.056 --> 01:14:29.656]  This is unbelievable.
[01:14:29.956 --> 01:14:30.157]  Now!
[01:14:30.497 --> 01:14:31.978]  This was used to take us off everything.
[01:14:32.819 --> 01:14:44.492]  And then expanding on that, you have them with Uranium One, you have FBI agents saying, we had total proof that they killed it, you have Robert Mueller killing it, and you have him on the tarmac.
[01:14:44.572 --> 01:14:45.653]  This is just ridiculous.
[01:14:45.673 --> 01:14:48.236]  It's like, it's so insane, Roger.
[01:14:48.496 --> 01:14:49.077]  It's unbelievable.
[01:14:49.097 --> 01:14:50.258]  We've got to keep hammering this.
[01:14:50.578 --> 01:14:53.562]  We've been saying this for three years.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:15:03.087]  Since before we were being investigated, we're the ones exposing Russian collusion, which we're specifically then blamed for, because we're the ones exposing it.
[01:15:03.948 --> 01:15:04.648]  Exactly right.
[01:15:04.788 --> 01:15:12.034]  I wrote a very long piece on Uranium One, the largest treasonous financial crime in American history.
[01:15:12.435 --> 01:15:14.516]  You can see it at the Infowars.com site.
[01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:18.600]  Now, the prosecutor who actually covered up
[01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:25.835]  The fact that the Russian energy company was bribing people to get this deal done is Rod Rosenstein.
[01:15:26.976 --> 01:15:27.937]  It was assigned to him.
[01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:29.499]  He was a cover-up man.
[01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:36.926]  His chief assistant, Aaron Zielinski, is the man running the prosecution into Roger Stone.
[01:15:36.946 --> 01:15:41.029]  Zielinski also worked on the Uranium One case.
[01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:43.712]  You see the stunning conflict of interest
[01:15:44.187 --> 01:15:45.187]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:15:45.227 --> 01:15:50.528]  Roger, Roger, we have to invent a new word beyond bravado, hubris, beyond chutzpah.
[01:15:51.009 --> 01:15:53.029]  Is this like chutzpah to infinity?
[01:15:53.049 --> 01:15:55.810]  I'm going to ask Roger the name of this new thing.
[01:15:56.110 --> 01:15:58.650]  We're going to coin a word when we come back.
[01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:01.851]  I mean, where the actual traders say we're traders.
[01:16:05.832 --> 01:16:10.473]  There are a lot of different schools of thought in marketing and in advertising and in sales.
[01:16:11.516 --> 01:16:15.479]  Now, I've been on the radio and TV for 23 plus years.
[01:16:15.999 --> 01:16:17.821]  I never went to any professional schools.
[01:16:18.681 --> 01:16:23.845]  But over the years, I learned a lot about those professional schools and the different perspectives.
[01:16:25.006 --> 01:16:27.848]  There's five or six different ways that people pitch things.
[01:16:27.908 --> 01:16:30.650]  And there's different permutations and commutations of that.
[01:16:32.191 --> 01:16:36.354]  But I just come from it with the golden rule, treat others like you want to be treated.
[01:16:37.015 --> 01:16:40.077]  Do unto others as you would like to be done unto you.
[01:16:43.306 --> 01:16:48.851]  We've taken that philosophy to the next level with all the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:49.531 --> 01:16:52.834]  Now, let's just look at two different systems of sales.
[01:16:52.854 --> 01:17:03.824]  The one that we fall into and then the one that targets about 25% of the population that is currently still the most successful and the most lucrative system.
[01:17:05.385 --> 01:17:06.546]  The corrupt form
[01:17:07.927 --> 01:17:12.991]  I wouldn't say it's completely evil, because it's targeting folks that just always want to pay more.
[01:17:13.951 --> 01:17:21.957]  It's a system where you put everything into it being elite and being top end and the most expensive.
[01:17:22.677 --> 01:17:27.981]  And in almost every case, what's in it does not measure up even close to what it's costing.
[01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:30.483]  Now, I've got a little bit of money.
[01:17:31.192 --> 01:17:34.717]  And so if I wanted to buy something fancy just because it's fancy, I could do it.
[01:17:35.578 --> 01:17:45.431]  But there's a lot of things that if it's a rip-off, even though I want it and I need it, I'm gonna go find the alternative that's as good, a lot of times better, for less just because I'm not into
[01:17:46.724 --> 01:17:47.705]  Wasting for no reason.
[01:17:47.725 --> 01:17:50.227]  I'd rather give it to charity or something like that.
[01:17:51.128 --> 01:17:53.891]  But that's the two different schools I thought I wanted to get into.
[01:17:54.351 --> 01:18:05.642]  The one where they know that if something's supposedly the best, you say it's the best, even though it's not, and you charge an outrageous amount, people believe it must be the best because it's an outrageous amount.
[01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:07.344]  Now, here's what I do.
[01:18:08.496 --> 01:18:13.758]  I go out of my own life and I find what is the best for the very lowest price.
[01:18:14.078 --> 01:18:14.638]  And here's an example.
[01:18:14.898 --> 01:18:17.680]  I have a Dodge Hellcat that came out four years ago.
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.701]  I didn't want a really fast sports car because I didn't want to be flashy.
[01:18:20.901 --> 01:18:22.081]  I was at the Dodge dealership.
[01:18:22.101 --> 01:18:22.882]  I bought a truck.
[01:18:23.002 --> 01:18:23.582]  The guy was illiterate.
[01:18:23.602 --> 01:18:24.342]  He said, have you heard of Hellcats?
[01:18:24.362 --> 01:18:25.402]  They're going to be coming out in about a year.
[01:18:25.623 --> 01:18:26.463]  And I said, uh,
[01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:27.203]  No.
[01:18:27.223 --> 01:18:36.711]  And he said, well, it's a Dodge Challenger, 700 plus horsepower, it's only $63,000, and Ferrari owns us now, and to have a car like this would cost like half a million dollars.
[01:18:37.111 --> 01:18:41.595]  And it didn't stick out, but I'd like a really fast, cool car, so I have the best of both worlds.
[01:18:41.615 --> 01:18:44.697]  It looks like a Challenger, but I've driven one of my friend's Ferraris.
[01:18:44.777 --> 01:18:45.698]  It's as fast.
[01:18:45.878 --> 01:18:46.439]  It's insane.
[01:18:46.719 --> 01:18:47.900]  That's my mindset.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:53.164]  I want a badass, black Ferrari for $63,000 instead of a half a million or a million.
[01:18:53.204 --> 01:18:55.006]  I mean, you can go up to two million for a Ferrari.
[01:18:55.826 --> 01:18:57.688]  I don't want the bling, I want the zing.
[01:18:57.969 --> 01:19:03.415]  We sold out for their year of in-sale of the Alexa Pure Pro gravity-fed filter.
[01:19:03.475 --> 01:19:04.096]  We sold it all out.
[01:19:04.436 --> 01:19:05.517]  They didn't think we could do it.
[01:19:05.718 --> 01:19:06.979]  You bought it, it's a great system.
[01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:09.061]  You got it for basically 49% off, half off.
[01:19:09.081 --> 01:19:09.682]  They've never done that.
[01:19:10.603 --> 01:19:15.648]  They're going to do the Alexa Pure Rees, that is, an ion filter, normally $250.
[01:19:15.968 --> 01:19:18.070]  Leading competitors aren't as good, they're $800.
[01:19:18.351 --> 01:19:18.791]  Same deal.
[01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:22.555]  Similar systems, four-stage ions, that aren't even as good, $400, $600, $800 depending on the unit.
[01:19:22.575 --> 01:19:22.975]  This is normally $240, $250.
[01:19:26.418 --> 01:19:26.558]  It's $127.
[01:19:26.939 --> 01:19:29.840]  Again, they're selling them to us at cost.
[01:19:30.241 --> 01:19:33.823]  We make like $30, and it clears out their end-of-year inventory.

[01:20:05.833 --> 01:20:08.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:55.023 --> 01:21:05.187]  So, you have literal, not Russian agents, the Clintons, Robert Mueller, all of them, are specialists at selling out America.
[01:21:06.227 --> 01:21:09.909]  In 1955, we had 50 plus percent of the world's wealth.
[01:21:10.529 --> 01:21:13.150]  We were 4% of the world's population.
[01:21:13.170 --> 01:21:14.370]  4% had more wealth than the other 96%.
[01:21:16.711 --> 01:21:21.693]  We had a giant middle class, bigger than all the middle classes on the planet combined.
[01:21:23.243 --> 01:21:24.924]  And we were exporting it to the planet.
[01:21:27.424 --> 01:21:37.308]  From the days of King George III in 1775, they had full-page articles in the major British papers saying we cannot allow the American system to flourish.
[01:21:39.451 --> 01:21:46.433]  Because if they let the commoners have land, and then they give everybody a license, or not have a license to build things, we'll be screwed.
[01:21:46.473 --> 01:21:49.614]  We won't control the colonies anymore, because they'll be able to make whatever they want.
[01:21:49.674 --> 01:22:05.578]  Back then they had laws for the Austrian-Hungarian, for the Spanish Empire, for the Dutch Empire, for the Portuguese Fading Empire, that you had to do complex manufacturing in the homeland.
[01:22:06.418 --> 01:22:08.639]  It was punishable by prison or death.
[01:22:09.753 --> 01:22:13.736]  If you tried to build a carriage or a firearm in the new world.
[01:22:15.398 --> 01:22:17.199]  Now why do I introduce that as Roger Stones here?
[01:22:17.279 --> 01:22:31.011]  Because Donald Trump understands globalism is a corrupt form of mercantilism and that it's picking winners and losers and that we've been set up for failure by design to geld us.
[01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:36.035]  That's a fancy way of saying castration, which is a fancy way of saying chop your balls off.
[01:22:37.576 --> 01:22:38.497]  You know, your testicles.
[01:22:40.799 --> 01:22:47.804]  And if you read Cecil Rhodes' book on the plan for world government that was adopted by traitors in the Blue Blood East Coast.
[01:22:49.786 --> 01:22:51.667]  Every time I do that, like, Jones hates the East Coast.
[01:22:51.707 --> 01:22:52.748]  No, I said the Blue Blood elites.
[01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:57.271]  And the British Empire that linked up with the Nazis who had the EU plan.
[01:22:57.511 --> 01:23:03.316]  And they're all competing for who gets control of it, but they're all building the world government wanting to be in the catbird seat.
[01:23:03.336 --> 01:23:06.478]  So Roger Stone joins us exclusively with Trump tweeting,
[01:23:07.947 --> 01:23:12.712]  Roger Stone's here to respond to Trump praising him and talking about, thank God he's got guts.
[01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:15.735]  Donald Trump, thank God Roger Stone's got guts.
[01:23:16.136 --> 01:23:17.237]  But really, is it guts?
[01:23:18.338 --> 01:23:20.000]  He's been friends with Trump 44 years.
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:24.204]  Plus, like Roger said on the show, I love how he said, I'm loyal, you know, I won't say anything.
[01:23:24.244 --> 01:23:27.047]  No, he didn't say, he didn't like hold it up like, I know something, because he doesn't.
[01:23:27.407 --> 01:23:29.830]  He said, there's nothing.
[01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:37.933]  So why would I... It'd be one thing if something was bad, but you stuck up for your friend or yourself, but there's nothing!
[01:23:38.133 --> 01:23:38.513]  I know!
[01:23:38.653 --> 01:23:39.273]  I've been there!
[01:23:40.173 --> 01:23:43.954]  That's what's so powerful about what you said, Roger, is you said, there's nothing!
[01:23:43.974 --> 01:23:53.256]  And again, they didn't get you with $15 million in laundered money like Michael Cohen and his taxi cab company, which he's pled guilty to.
[01:23:53.736 --> 01:23:55.457]  What do you make of this?
[01:23:56.454 --> 01:24:01.304]  And Trump saying he's taking the gloves off, knowing Donald Trump for so long, he's a counter puncher.
[01:24:01.925 --> 01:24:03.829]  He wouldn't say he's coming after him if he wasn't.
[01:24:04.130 --> 01:24:05.994]  What are we going to see as the wrath of 45?
[01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:10.635]  Well, I think he has the detonator in his hands.
[01:24:10.815 --> 01:24:30.327]  I believe he has the documents that can prove that not only was there a willful, preconceived effort to use the surveillance capability of the state to spy on his presidential campaign, to use the FBI to infiltrate his campaign, but he can show exactly who was involved.
[01:24:30.947 --> 01:24:35.750]  And I suspect that goes all the way to the top, meaning President Barack Obama.
[01:24:36.905 --> 01:24:37.826]  The Clintons.
[01:24:38.446 --> 01:24:40.607]  He also, I'm sure, now completely understands.
[01:24:40.647 --> 01:24:41.707]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:24:42.148 --> 01:24:47.630]  We know they gave the order, and to cover their ass earlier, they admitted it in late 2016, early 2017.
[01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:52.472]  Then they realized how much they'd messed up, and backpedaled, and said they never said it.
[01:24:54.253 --> 01:24:59.815]  Well, Peter Strzok's text message, the rogue FBI agent, I think makes it clear.
[01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:02.356]  No, I think he has them.
[01:25:02.456 --> 01:25:05.038]  And now I think he understands the implications of Uranium One.
[01:25:06.531 --> 01:25:16.460]  As I said, the largest treasonous financial crime in American history, the crime that Mr. Mueller and his minion Aaron Zelensky are moving to cover up.
[01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:27.089]  It was Mr. Rosenstein, former top deputy, who suggested to Jerry Corsi that he adopt two completely false narratives about me.
[01:25:28.259 --> 01:25:39.544]  It was Mr. Zelensky, who was the chief assistant to the man who led the cover-up of the bribery by the Russian energy company, which was never pursued.
[01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:51.689]  And now that's why they seek to bust into this whistleblower's house to try to get the evidence of their wrongdoing, but it's too late, because it's already gone to the inspector general.
[01:25:51.969 --> 01:25:53.850]  It's already gone to the Congress.
[01:25:56.728 --> 01:25:58.137]  Now, expanding on that...
[01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:05.113]  Clearly, for those that don't understand business, you hire a lawyer in the local city that's the top guy.
[01:26:05.553 --> 01:26:08.074]  Trump owns hundreds of properties in the U.S., thousands worldwide.
[01:26:08.394 --> 01:26:10.776]  They've raided a lawyer in Chicago, other lawyers.
[01:26:11.316 --> 01:26:17.659]  They go through, see the lawyer's done something weird, then they raid their office and say, if you say Trump did something bad, we'll let you off.
[01:26:17.879 --> 01:26:23.623]  And I think if they get five or six lawyers together saying Trump's a bad guy, that'll somehow look like Trump's done something wrong.
[01:26:23.643 --> 01:26:27.825]  If there's a separation of powers, they still can't have a real indictment that goes anywhere.
[01:26:27.945 --> 01:26:29.186]  I don't see people buying this.
[01:26:30.026 --> 01:26:31.967]  It's extremely transparent.
[01:26:32.828 --> 01:26:34.789]  No, I think it's absolutely clear.
[01:26:34.829 --> 01:26:36.010]  Here, of course, is the point.
[01:26:36.611 --> 01:26:45.997]  The American people have figured out that two years and $30 million into this investigation, Mr. Mueller has no evidence of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.
[01:26:46.598 --> 01:26:48.399]  He desperately needs headlines.
[01:26:48.819 --> 01:26:59.627]  Therefore, indicting Michael Cohen on something pertaining to Russia with the broad but completely false implication that this has some impact or involvement of the president is a PR stunt.
[01:27:00.322 --> 01:27:08.245]  It's kind of like the indictment of 17 Russian intelligence agents that you know you will never bring to trial, and therefore it's a PR document.
[01:27:08.825 --> 01:27:11.586]  And then you have people like Chris Cuomo stating it as a fact.
[01:27:11.666 --> 01:27:14.347]  Well, the Russians hacked to the DNC.
[01:27:14.527 --> 01:27:15.407]  No, we don't know that.
[01:27:15.547 --> 01:27:16.848]  No, that is unproven.
[01:27:17.128 --> 01:27:18.408]  That's supposition.
[01:27:18.769 --> 01:27:20.009]  That's an allegation.
[01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:21.129]  That's a charge.
[01:27:21.490 --> 01:27:22.670]  That's an accusation.
[01:27:23.326 --> 01:27:34.712]  It's not a known fact that has been ruled on by a federal court, largely because it's not true, and they couldn't prove it if they needed to, because as you and I both know, it most likely did not happen that way.
[01:27:35.731 --> 01:27:42.316]  Well, they've got to be desperate now because they've come up empty and they're trying to kill the economy, but that's going to blow up in their face.
[01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:44.278]  And Trump's not backing down.
[01:27:44.538 --> 01:27:46.560]  And you've done nothing wrong.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.981]  I've done nothing wrong.
[01:27:48.101 --> 01:27:52.485]  Corsi's now not rolling over and making stuff up.
[01:27:53.145 --> 01:27:55.247]  And they have got to be really, really scared.
[01:27:55.267 --> 01:27:56.829]  But let's not be too confident.
[01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:58.870]  What are their aces in the hole?
[01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:00.652]  What should we be worried about here, Roger?
[01:28:01.912 --> 01:28:13.987]  Well, I mean, look, Mr. Mueller still and his guns still like to pretend like they are the government and that they are somehow supreme.
[01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:17.692]  My lawyers are tracking the prosecutorial misconduct.
[01:28:18.294 --> 01:28:21.477]  Of the people there, Jeannie Rhee and Mr. Zielinski.
[01:28:21.857 --> 01:28:25.340]  Now be prepared to make the appropriate complaints at the appropriate time.
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:36.168]  And these things would all be raised if we ever got to a trial in which they brought bogus charges against me in an attempt to frame me or railroad me.
[01:28:37.074 --> 01:28:38.975]  Because I'm a supporter of the president.
[01:28:39.175 --> 01:28:43.538]  In the meantime, Alex, I have to be honest with you, this is destroying me financially.
[01:28:43.698 --> 01:28:47.880]  I know the hit that InfoWars has taken over the concerted campaign.
[01:28:48.121 --> 01:28:52.443]  I tell you what, I got Stuart Rhodes popping in with big breaking news in only five minutes.
[01:28:52.483 --> 01:28:53.964]  He's in studio tomorrow.
[01:28:54.344 --> 01:28:56.986]  But I want to talk about, because we never really personalize this.
[01:28:57.066 --> 01:28:59.607]  I always say, Roger, we're going to talk about this, really talk about it.
[01:28:59.627 --> 01:29:00.588]  So let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:23.953]  If we look at how Brighton is as an area, it's got an extremely high LGBT population, it's extremely liberal, so when kids are in a school and they feel, oh, there's no stigma attached to being gender fluid or trans, so if they feel supported in an environment, then they're going to be questioned.
[01:29:23.973 --> 01:29:25.674]  Why should they be encouraged to do this?
[01:29:25.774 --> 01:29:32.721]  Nobody's going to persuade me that 76 kids at one school in Brighton woke up one day and decided to be genderfluid.
[01:29:32.741 --> 01:29:34.262]  Who says that they woke up one day?
[01:29:34.282 --> 01:29:38.026]  Who says that it's not something that happens overnight?
[01:29:38.066 --> 01:29:38.706]  Where does this end?
[01:29:38.726 --> 01:29:41.429]  Do we end up with literally nobody in the future?
[01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:43.830]  Identifying as male and female?
[01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:45.091]  Well, maybe, maybe.
[01:29:45.171 --> 01:29:45.371]  Really?
[01:29:45.611 --> 01:29:46.592]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:29:46.692 --> 01:29:47.772]  Why would you be happy with that?
[01:29:47.792 --> 01:29:52.635]  Not nobody, but some, you know, some people are trans and that's, that's the fact.
[01:29:52.715 --> 01:29:56.898]  Do you genuinely think 76 kids in one school are transgender?
[01:29:56.958 --> 01:29:57.918]  I'm saying that it's a possibility.
[01:29:57.938 --> 01:29:58.638]  Or do you think it's possible?
[01:29:58.739 --> 01:29:59.419]  Is it possible?
[01:29:59.579 --> 01:30:00.660]  I said it's a possibility.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:01.180]  They've all just...
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:11.844]  Let's now go back to Faith Goldie, who is a woman.
[01:30:11.864 --> 01:30:12.964]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:30:13.124 --> 01:30:14.305]  Faith Goldie is a woman.
[01:30:14.445 --> 01:30:15.245]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:15.345 --> 01:30:15.925]  I am a man.
[01:30:15.965 --> 01:30:16.746]  You can see the difference.
[01:30:16.766 --> 01:30:17.206]  I'm ugly.
[01:30:17.226 --> 01:30:17.646]  She's pretty.
[01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:18.806]  She can have babies.
[01:30:18.886 --> 01:30:19.247]  I can't.
[01:30:19.427 --> 01:30:21.607]  I can gouge people's eyeballs out pretty easily.
[01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:23.568]  She might not be able to do it as easy, but she's pretty tough.
[01:30:23.708 --> 01:30:25.149]  Faith, thanks for coming on with us today.
[01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.949]  It's great to see you.
[01:30:26.069 --> 01:30:27.390]  Thanks for having me back on, Alex.
[01:30:27.630 --> 01:30:40.736]  As for the grooming of these young autistic children, that's what we're seeing across the UK and other jurisdictions, this is just the next evolution of what the Gay-Straight Alliance groups across North America, that they were putting into our school institutions.
[01:30:40.796 --> 01:30:42.877]  This is just Generation 2.
[01:30:42.977 --> 01:30:53.662]  They were basically breeding grounds to normalize deviant behavior, and then also not just normalize it, but also just sort of make it a trend, and that's indeed what we're seeing here.
[01:30:54.142 --> 01:30:55.663]  Praying on autistic children?
[01:30:55.944 --> 01:31:08.053]  This is what some of the most tyrannical regimes have done in even recent history, and that's to use the slow, the autistic, to help bolster, frankly, their statistics.
[01:31:08.113 --> 01:31:17.681]  And that's what this LGBTP movement is doing, is that they're praying on autistic children so to bolster their statistics.
[01:31:18.021 --> 01:31:19.201]  This is beyond sick.
[01:31:19.221 --> 01:31:20.882]  This is, this is reprehensible.
[01:31:20.902 --> 01:31:23.442]  This is evil and it should be condemned in every single way.
[01:31:23.822 --> 01:31:27.523]  We were joking around a little, talking a little bit about sports during the, um, during the break.
[01:31:27.543 --> 01:31:28.583]  So I just want to say this.
[01:31:29.143 --> 01:31:31.784]  Men, turn off your TVs on Sundays.
[01:31:32.124 --> 01:31:36.345]  As video games are to young men, sports games are to older men.
[01:31:36.665 --> 01:31:40.386]  It is normal and natural for you to have loyalty, to have patriotism, to want to
[01:31:40.486 --> 01:31:41.507]  Fight for your country.
[01:31:41.787 --> 01:31:44.569]  To want to have your team be victorious.
[01:31:44.949 --> 01:31:47.391]  But it's not on the 50-yard line.
[01:31:47.511 --> 01:31:49.352]  It's on your border lines right now.
[01:31:49.492 --> 01:31:50.673]  That's where we are called.
[01:31:50.993 --> 01:31:57.077]  Your colors are not some city that is far away from you that you might not even have any historical connection to.
[01:31:57.438 --> 01:32:01.661]  The colors that you should be bleeding are the ones on your national flag.
[01:32:02.061 --> 01:32:06.664]  And so I pray, folks, just turn off all of the sports balls.
[01:32:07.124 --> 01:32:14.487]  It's cultural, it's Cux nationalism, it's feeding natural appetites in a very unnatural and frankly unproductive way.
[01:32:14.607 --> 01:32:17.829]  So even if you're not out there fighting for your country, go fight for your family.
[01:32:18.129 --> 01:32:20.330]  Turn off your TV on Sunday.
[01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:22.351]  It's just a bunch of guys taking a knee anyway.
[01:32:22.691 --> 01:32:28.473]  And go spend some time with Junior or spend some time with, you know, your local community center, whatever it is.
[01:32:28.853 --> 01:32:35.016]  And why don't you go have a rally against this UN migrant compact that we're going to be signing any day now down in Morocco.
[01:32:35.556 --> 01:32:44.205]  Look, if you look at all the top EU leaders right now, they've got all sorts of degeneracies, but one thing that they don't have are kids, and that's why they don't give a damn about the future of our nation.
[01:32:44.385 --> 01:32:54.495]  Unlike President God Emperor Donald Trump, it might be from a couple different ladies, but he's got lots of kids, and he sure as heck gives a damn about the future of not just that nation, but also all of the global order.
[01:32:54.515 --> 01:32:58.439]  So God bless him, and God bless America, and God bless you Alex, I'm so happy I was back on your show today.
[01:32:58.499 --> 01:32:59.640]  You are awesome, amazing.
[01:33:06.785 --> 01:33:09.401]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:23.007 --> 01:33:28.835]  We now take you live to the most demonized, lie-to-back, attack broadcast in the world for good reason.
[01:33:29.276 --> 01:33:29.856]  We're over the target.
[01:33:29.876 --> 01:33:33.301]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:34.402 --> 01:33:39.129]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:47.659 --> 01:33:49.580]  That's how we navigate towards the attack.
[01:33:50.141 --> 01:33:53.803]  That's our sonar, radar, heat-seeking guidance system.
[01:33:54.943 --> 01:33:56.364]  We don't run from the war.
[01:33:56.945 --> 01:33:57.705]  We run to it.
[01:33:57.725 --> 01:34:00.727]  And that's why the globalists hate our stinking guts.
[01:34:02.488 --> 01:34:05.129]  Their attempt to break our will is over.
[01:34:06.430 --> 01:34:12.334]  And the animating contest, whether I personally am successful or not, will spur others to the fight.
[01:34:14.264 --> 01:34:19.311]  The globalists always misread, because they look through things from their prism, not ours.
[01:34:19.791 --> 01:34:26.079]  Stuart Rose is in studio tomorrow, founder of Oath Keepers, former Chief Staffer, Ron Paul, great patriot, Army veteran.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:29.804]  He is going to be in studio, but he's running a major operation down the border.
[01:34:29.824 --> 01:34:32.147]  But Roger Stone, who I want to support.
[01:34:33.157 --> 01:34:34.098]  I've learned how things work.
[01:34:34.658 --> 01:34:38.321]  He always just throws out a little, oh, by the way, they're bankrupting me.
[01:34:38.361 --> 01:34:47.467]  And I know like a million dollars in bills, all the fake lawsuits and the congressional subpoenas and investigations and even get a decent lawyers, you know, like $500 an hour.
[01:34:47.567 --> 01:34:48.627]  It's incredible what happens.
[01:34:49.108 --> 01:34:54.331]  They've sent millions last few years, beating 15 of the 20 fake lawsuits.
[01:34:54.592 --> 01:34:55.792]  So praise God that's happened.
[01:34:55.812 --> 01:34:57.954]  But it is, I don't want to say crippling, but
[01:35:00.583 --> 01:35:03.264]  I walk around with no Achilles on my right, so whatever.
[01:35:03.384 --> 01:35:04.504]  People call that being crippled.
[01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:10.105]  The point is, is that... Kind of cool having a numb leg, actually.
[01:35:10.665 --> 01:35:18.127]  The point is, is that, I said, Roger, I'm happy to do fundraisers for you, but when you do it, let's spend a minute or two on it, and say why.
[01:35:18.187 --> 01:35:21.447]  So, you can go to Roger's Defense Fund, we'll tell you about it in a moment.
[01:35:22.928 --> 01:35:28.269]  And you can buy his books and things at InfoWarsTour.com, but it is true, it takes a lot of money to win this war.
[01:35:29.605 --> 01:35:38.768]  And InfoWars sells t-shirts and books and supplements and normally our most expensive products have a 150% markup.
[01:35:39.068 --> 01:35:45.811]  Most supplements by other people have a 500 to 700 because after marketing and FDA and all the stuff, I don't know why they do it.
[01:35:47.311 --> 01:35:52.053]  But they put nothing in the tablets or nothing in the elixirs with us.
[01:35:53.994 --> 01:35:54.514]  It's always
[01:35:56.032 --> 01:35:56.513]  30-40% off.
[01:35:56.613 --> 01:35:58.858]  So you're getting basically 100% markup.
[01:35:58.898 --> 01:35:59.399]  And we go 50%, 70% off.
[01:35:59.419 --> 01:36:00.402]  It's a lost leader.
[01:36:03.433 --> 01:36:05.694]  So we have the special right now, the biggest we've ever done.
[01:36:06.074 --> 01:36:08.895]  We're doing total clearance this year to sell everything before the new year.
[01:36:09.235 --> 01:36:11.436]  So we don't get with inventory tax, federal and state.
[01:36:12.236 --> 01:36:19.278]  Texas Braggs don't have an income tax, but if you actually run a business, they've got a franchise tax, which is a inventory tax.
[01:36:19.298 --> 01:36:21.259]  That's why you hear the car commercials if you live in Texas.
[01:36:21.619 --> 01:36:25.220]  You know, where you literally do get the best deals in the last few weeks of January on a car.
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:30.141]  It can be a $50,000 car, get it for $30,000 because they're going to have to pay $6,000, $7,000, $8,000, $9,000, $10,000 in tax on that sucker.
[01:36:32.583 --> 01:36:34.546]  So, I'm selling everything.
[01:36:35.507 --> 01:36:36.408]  You get a free shirt.
[01:36:37.229 --> 01:36:38.951]  It's everyone is Alex Jones.
[01:36:39.332 --> 01:36:41.535]  Don't censor me with a gas and flag.
[01:36:41.915 --> 01:36:42.636]  Limited edition.
[01:36:43.337 --> 01:36:44.439]  Free shipping store wide.
[01:36:44.459 --> 01:36:45.780]  50 to 75% off.
[01:36:46.161 --> 01:36:49.125]  Double Patriot points and so much more in PolarStore.com.
[01:36:50.745 --> 01:36:51.546]  Don't fight the traffic.
[01:36:51.586 --> 01:36:52.407]  Don't fight the crowds.
[01:36:52.727 --> 01:36:53.467]  Get great products.
[01:36:54.188 --> 01:36:55.489]  And that's how you donate to us.
[01:36:55.589 --> 01:36:59.293]  But let me tell you, at this price, this is a loss leader with the free shirt.
[01:36:59.653 --> 01:37:01.174]  Because a shirt costs us like five bucks.
[01:37:01.595 --> 01:37:03.256]  It's a nice soft shirt, but it's only printed on the front.
[01:37:03.276 --> 01:37:04.057]  That's what's expensive.
[01:37:04.577 --> 01:37:05.558]  So you add that to everything else.
[01:37:05.578 --> 01:37:08.000]  This is a loss leader sale, but it spreads the word.
[01:37:08.461 --> 01:37:09.522]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:09.562 --> 01:37:10.523]  Thanks for all your support.
[01:37:10.563 --> 01:37:14.546]  But the great supplements, X2, X3, Brain Force.
[01:37:15.527 --> 01:37:18.368]  Plus, there's so many big deals up there.
[01:37:18.929 --> 01:37:19.869]  Take advantage of it today.
[01:37:19.889 --> 01:37:21.030]  It's our 12 Days of Christmas.
[01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.950]  It's going for 12 days.
[01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:26.953]  There's always one special every day that's 75% off, so be sure and check it out.
[01:37:27.533 --> 01:37:31.015]  Roger, specifically, tell people, I mean, just talk about it.
[01:37:31.115 --> 01:37:33.696]  I know it makes the enemy happy, but you, I know for a fact,
[01:37:34.156 --> 01:37:34.957]  I don't just believe people.
[01:37:34.997 --> 01:37:37.238]  I demand to see their finances if they're wanting raises or whatever.
[01:37:37.799 --> 01:37:41.101]  Roger, you know, has not done lobbying for almost 10 years.
[01:37:41.802 --> 01:37:44.284]  He wrote books exposing the Bushes and so much more.
[01:37:44.744 --> 01:37:46.445]  He kind of got on the outside of the establishment.
[01:37:46.886 --> 01:37:47.806]  And so Roger's what?
[01:37:47.846 --> 01:37:50.609]  Got one client left in lobbying and he's got him for wars.
[01:37:51.449 --> 01:37:54.232]  And, you know, Roger has trouble keeping the lights on.
[01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:55.313]  So it is a true statement.
[01:37:56.013 --> 01:38:05.882]  And we don't want to hobble ourselves or grovel here, but I think if you're going to ask for money, you might as well just tell folks that, Robert, you're not going to break, but Robert Mueller has bankrupted you almost.
[01:38:06.342 --> 01:38:07.903]  You had to move out of your house because of death threats.
[01:38:07.943 --> 01:38:08.684]  That was in the news.
[01:38:09.525 --> 01:38:11.106]  So you're not having a very good day here.
[01:38:11.146 --> 01:38:12.287]  How do folks donate to you, Roger?
[01:38:12.307 --> 01:38:18.212]  And we're going to go to the great patriot about to jump on a plane, the founder of Oathkeeper Stuart Rhodes.
[01:38:18.232 --> 01:38:18.713]  Go ahead, Roger.
[01:38:19.738 --> 01:38:27.961]  Well, Alex, as you know, one of the tactics of Mr. Mueller and his minions, his retinue, is to try to bankrupt you.
[01:38:28.361 --> 01:38:40.985]  That way, like General Flynn, a great patriot, when you're out of money, when you're out of resources, when you can no longer afford to fight, they pressure you into pleading guilty to some process crime you didn't commit.
[01:38:41.626 --> 01:38:48.624]  In my case, they hope to bankrupt me and then squeeze me to testify against President Donald Trump, Michael Cohen style.
[01:38:48.825 --> 01:38:50.228]  And I'm not going to do that.
[01:38:50.879 --> 01:38:53.380]  But I've already spent half a million dollars in legal fees.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.361]  I'm looking at another two and a half million.
[01:38:55.722 --> 01:38:57.323]  They have dried up my business.
[01:38:57.903 --> 01:39:01.285]  I was looking at perhaps having one of the best years I've ever had.
[01:39:01.845 --> 01:39:05.247]  Facebook kneecapped me in the sale of Stone's Rules.
[01:39:05.607 --> 01:39:08.368]  Thank God you can buy it at the m4s.com store.
[01:39:08.789 --> 01:39:12.851]  So folks who want to help us and want to make sure that the Stones have a real Christmas,
[01:39:13.371 --> 01:39:16.434]  You can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:39:16.614 --> 01:39:23.720]  I have to subsidize my own legal expenses if I could raise the money for these lawyers, and they aren't inexpensive, as you point out.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.501]  I've got excellent lawyers.
[01:39:26.062 --> 01:39:29.384]  They're not raping me on rates, but they're still expensive.
[01:39:30.645 --> 01:39:31.406]  Let's be clear.
[01:39:31.906 --> 01:39:33.348]  We helped reboot America.
[01:39:33.908 --> 01:39:34.669]  We're the target.
[01:39:34.689 --> 01:39:38.052]  The listeners get that if they can destroy us, we'll be silenced.
[01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:40.093]  So, you're doing a great job, Roger.
[01:39:40.133 --> 01:39:41.474]  You'll be on The War Room today, 3 o'clock.
[01:39:41.514 --> 01:39:41.995]  God bless you.
[01:39:43.148 --> 01:39:44.769]  StoneDefenseFund.com, Alex.
[01:39:44.829 --> 01:39:45.349]  Many thanks.
[01:39:45.909 --> 01:39:46.329]  Absolutely.
[01:39:46.349 --> 01:39:47.590]  And I do know his finances.
[01:39:47.630 --> 01:39:50.091]  It's not that I don't believe Roger, but I wanted to see it all.
[01:39:50.151 --> 01:39:54.853]  And, you know, Roger had to move out of his bigger house, which was not a big house.
[01:39:54.913 --> 01:39:58.815]  I mean, he's, he's, he's... And I know that makes Mueller very, very happy.
[01:39:58.875 --> 01:39:59.875]  He's done that and everything else.
[01:40:00.735 --> 01:40:01.656]  But this is a war.
[01:40:01.676 --> 01:40:02.456]  So we expect this.
[01:40:02.476 --> 01:40:05.337]  We're just saying, hey, we are your chess pieces in the war.
[01:40:05.638 --> 01:40:07.118]  Do you want to fund your horses in the fight?
[01:40:07.138 --> 01:40:08.279]  And the listeners get that.
[01:40:08.339 --> 01:40:08.799]  So I'm just saying,
[01:40:09.159 --> 01:40:09.660]  Baby birds.
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:11.041]  We need support because we're under attack.
[01:40:11.321 --> 01:40:12.762]  All right, thank you for holding.
[01:40:12.862 --> 01:40:14.483]  I just, I wanted Roger to finish that.
[01:40:14.884 --> 01:40:17.386]  Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers, great patriot.
[01:40:18.146 --> 01:40:18.827]  So much happening.
[01:40:19.067 --> 01:40:20.088]  He's about to jump on an airplane.
[01:40:20.128 --> 01:40:23.131]  He's got some really big, huge announcements he's about to make.
[01:40:23.171 --> 01:40:25.793]  So Stuart of OathKeepers.org, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:27.995]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:40:28.015 --> 01:40:28.535]  Good to be here.
[01:40:28.615 --> 01:40:29.796]  It's good to have you.
[01:40:29.816 --> 01:40:31.057]  Well, you've got some big announcements.
[01:40:31.077 --> 01:40:32.198]  You'll be in studio tomorrow.
[01:40:32.238 --> 01:40:34.660]  You're down there with your great organization, Oath Keepers.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.822]  Tell us what's happening on the Texas border and other borders.
[01:40:38.055 --> 01:40:39.737]  Well, we're doing a Leaders Recon here.
[01:40:39.877 --> 01:40:41.798]  I just got done doing one in California.
[01:40:42.579 --> 01:40:48.784]  I sent you some pictures of, you know, there's large vacant areas of the border still, despite the buildup.
[01:40:48.804 --> 01:40:55.270]  This is what people don't understand, is that even with the military going in to back up border protection, there's still not enough boots on the ground on the border.
[01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:57.552]  You know, Trump ultimately is going to have to call out the U.S.
[01:40:57.592 --> 01:40:59.634]  military en masse, as was done
[01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:02.276]  Back in the day when they were chasing down Poncho Villa.
[01:41:02.736 --> 01:41:05.317]  So we did a Borders recon, a little recon in California.
[01:41:05.338 --> 01:41:06.518]  I'm doing one now in Texas.
[01:41:06.538 --> 01:41:09.000]  I'll be flying over the border today and tomorrow.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:17.025]  And we're going to be putting people in the air with drones and planes and also boots on the ground and all the border states.
[01:41:17.065 --> 01:41:26.852]  We're doing a call out starting tomorrow for volunteers, for volunteer pilots and volunteer drone operators and also boots on the ground volunteers, whether they're Oak Keepers or not.
[01:41:26.872 --> 01:41:28.853]  If you're a Patriot, sign up.
[01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:36.374]  Now again, as you point out, a 2,300 mile border and it's already completely overrun.
[01:41:36.474 --> 01:41:37.714]  Trump is trying to control it.
[01:41:38.034 --> 01:41:38.454]  The U.N.
[01:41:38.515 --> 01:41:41.015]  is running this assault and it's going to be great.
[01:41:41.035 --> 01:41:42.156]  You're going to be flying over the border.
[01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:45.637]  We're going to have so much of these images coming in, Stuart.
[01:41:46.617 --> 01:41:49.238]  But as you point out, as an Army veteran, I mean, this whole U.N.
[01:41:49.278 --> 01:41:52.219]  project, the mayor of Tijuana, we'll talk about when we come back from break,
[01:41:52.819 --> 01:41:54.800]  The mayor of Genoa has said these are criminals.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:57.102]  The UN is organizing women and children.
[01:41:57.202 --> 01:41:58.843]  Some of these kids are kidnapped, confirmed.
[01:41:59.223 --> 01:42:02.726]  Arrest the leaders of the caravan who are funded by George Soros.
[01:42:04.474 --> 01:42:05.554]  Yeah, they're a cartel.
[01:42:05.694 --> 01:42:06.355]  They're notorious.
[01:42:06.375 --> 01:42:08.896]  They're like the Western Hemisphere version of ISIS.
[01:42:09.436 --> 01:42:14.618]  They sell women and children to sex slavery in Mexico, as you know, and also in the United States.
[01:42:14.738 --> 01:42:16.098]  They're modern-day slavers.
[01:42:16.578 --> 01:42:21.140]  And so the left in this country is aiding and abetting the modern-day version of the slave trade.
[01:42:21.380 --> 01:42:22.280]  That's what this really is.
[01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:23.601]  They're taking over.
[01:42:23.741 --> 01:42:24.661]  It's a cartel state.
[01:42:25.021 --> 01:42:26.762]  Northern Mexico is run by the cartels.
[01:42:27.322 --> 01:42:27.982]  That's who runs it.
[01:42:28.282 --> 01:42:28.923]  It's the Lozadas.
[01:42:30.442 --> 01:42:31.243]  I'm good to go.
[01:42:42.998 --> 01:42:45.960]  I'm scaring your teeth, he's still got a Republican Senator.
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:46.961]  Otherwise, you've flipped.
[01:42:47.501 --> 01:42:54.167]  It's because the illegal... And Beto, Beto the Pedo, I mean the Beto, he got caught funding the illegal caravan.
[01:42:54.207 --> 01:42:55.668]  This is a link up with the cartels.
[01:42:55.928 --> 01:43:02.353]  We'll be right back with Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, great patriot, to give not just his view on the border, but his big view of where the country is right now.
[01:43:03.596 --> 01:43:11.663]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.

[01:44:51.435 --> 01:44:54.676]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[01:44:55.116 --> 01:44:59.858]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWar possible.
[01:45:00.218 --> 01:45:02.158]  Again, you are the resistance.
[01:45:03.099 --> 01:45:03.779]  Three words.
[01:45:04.819 --> 01:45:06.500]  Energized quantum state.
[01:45:08.060 --> 01:45:08.560]  Two words.
[01:45:10.181 --> 01:45:10.201]  X3.
[01:45:11.795 --> 01:45:16.077]  You've seen how the entire global power structure is desperate to shut us down.
[01:45:16.638 --> 01:45:17.438]  And it's for good reasons.
[01:45:18.299 --> 01:45:24.382]  We've done our research, we've seen how they're targeting the people, and how they're trying to suppress the population.
[01:45:24.522 --> 01:45:28.504]  And one of their biggest attacks is fluoridation of water, the bad halogen.
[01:45:28.524 --> 01:45:37.129]  There's a bunch of bad halogens, but fluoride is chief amongst them, and then they electrify it into an acid base, so it's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:45:38.576 --> 01:45:50.930]  Survival Shield X3 is the latest in the X family and has all three types of iodine from thousands of feet deep under the earth so it's not radioactive or be contaminated by modern chemicals.
[01:45:51.490 --> 01:45:55.855]  And it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it and stops it from being oxidized.
[01:45:55.895 --> 01:45:56.135]  Folks,
[01:45:58.064 --> 01:46:00.727]  Everything we do makes the globalists pull their hair out for a reason.
[01:46:00.947 --> 01:46:03.690]  Because, again, we study how they're attacking, what they're obsessed with.
[01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:06.553]  They are completely into iodine.
[01:46:06.913 --> 01:46:08.935]  They've even tried to buy us out and get us to stop doing this.
[01:46:10.236 --> 01:46:13.620]  And most of the forms of iodine are bound, and so you're not absorbing.
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.762]  X1, X2 are great.
[01:46:17.396 --> 01:46:18.857]  X3 is the next level.
[01:46:18.877 --> 01:46:22.618]  It has the Deep Earth Crystals, the other two types, and a little bit of Vitamin C to energize it.
[01:46:23.018 --> 01:46:26.580]  It's available in 2-ounce and 1-ounce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:33.843]  And from the very start, 50% off and free shipping because I want you to get it, and I want you to take it, and I want you to see what it does.
[01:46:34.563 --> 01:46:38.685]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, X3.
[01:46:39.185 --> 01:46:40.205]  Now again, it's an element.
[01:46:40.225 --> 01:46:41.766]  It takes a few weeks to kick in.
[01:46:41.786 --> 01:46:45.047]  A lot of people detoxify about three weeks in.
[01:46:45.087 --> 01:46:46.528]  So be ready for that, because you're a physician.
[01:46:47.268 --> 01:46:53.091]  Start your journey today at InfoWarsLife.com with our newest product that I'm the most excited about ever, X3!
[01:46:53.531 --> 01:46:57.453]  Just like our info changes the world, this changes your body and your life.
[01:46:58.633 --> 01:47:01.775]  X3, you can't lose, it helps fund the info war, and it's great for you.
[01:47:06.217 --> 01:47:08.838]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.382 --> 01:47:25.372]  They're intentionally leaving the borders open in Europe, bringing in mass refugees, among them are going to be jihadists, who are setting up a future Tet Offensive, Tet-style offensive, in Europe.
[01:47:25.592 --> 01:47:27.113]  And the same thing's being done to this country.
[01:47:27.594 --> 01:47:37.984]  On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor, half-frozen snake.
[01:47:39.713 --> 01:47:44.116]  His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew.
[01:47:44.656 --> 01:47:45.737]  Oh well, she cried.
[01:47:46.197 --> 01:47:46.998]  I'll take you in.
[01:47:47.438 --> 01:47:48.559]  And I'll take care of you.
[01:47:49.679 --> 01:47:51.140]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:47:51.701 --> 01:47:53.162]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:47:53.622 --> 01:47:55.183]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:47:56.264 --> 01:47:58.885]  Sighed the vicious snake.
[01:48:00.867 --> 01:48:02.948]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:48:03.388 --> 01:48:04.849]  Take me in for heaven's sake.
[01:48:05.690 --> 01:48:07.171]  Take me in, oh tender woman.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:11.002]  Beside the vicious snake.
[01:48:12.222 --> 01:48:14.724]  Now she clutched him to her bosom.
[01:48:15.184 --> 01:48:17.045]  You're so beautiful, she cried.
[01:48:17.845 --> 01:48:22.108]  But if I hadn't brought you in, by now you might have died.
[01:48:23.211 --> 01:48:28.356]  She stroked his pretty skin, and then she kissed and held him tight.
[01:48:29.337 --> 01:48:36.463]  But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite.
[01:48:37.404 --> 01:48:38.986]  I saved you, cried the woman.
[01:48:40.066 --> 01:48:41.567]  And you've bit me.
[01:48:41.647 --> 01:48:42.708]  Heavens, why?
[01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:45.650]  You know your bite is poisonous.
[01:48:46.131 --> 01:48:48.212]  And now I'm going to die.
[01:48:49.193 --> 01:48:53.296]  Oh, shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin.
[01:48:54.136 --> 01:48:59.400]  You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.
[01:49:02.983 --> 01:49:08.027]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:49:12.210 --> 01:49:13.871]  He's joined us, I thought I'd play that intro.
[01:49:13.891 --> 01:49:17.333]  Stuart Rhodes of OathKeepers.org introduced that great patriot.
[01:49:18.073 --> 01:49:21.615]  Stuart graduated, I'm assuming, cum laude from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
[01:49:21.655 --> 01:49:27.438]  He worked professional sculptor in Nevada, state certified, concealed carry firearms instructor after college.
[01:49:27.458 --> 01:49:38.764]  He worked representative of Ron Paul's office, graduated from Yale Law School in 2004, where his paper, Solving the Puzzle of the Enemy Combatant Status, won Yale's Judge William E. Miller Prize for Best Paper in the Bill of Rights.
[01:49:39.364 --> 01:49:40.465]  He assisted teaching U.S.
[01:49:40.505 --> 01:49:47.488]  military history at Yale's University Department, was a Yale research scholar, and is now writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people.
[01:49:47.868 --> 01:49:54.310]  While practicing law and maintaining it, he also served as a volunteer fireman, and he founded Oath Keepers.org, which is a great patriotic group.
[01:49:54.591 --> 01:49:56.271]  So in the eight minutes we have left, you've got the floor.
[01:49:56.331 --> 01:50:01.914]  Tell us about the big announcements, what's happening, your battlespace view on what Trump's doing, where we're at.
[01:50:02.711 --> 01:50:03.593]  Well, we're running out of time.
[01:50:03.613 --> 01:50:07.119]  They're running the clock out on Trump, and so what's going to have to happen...
[01:50:16.221 --> 01:50:20.922]  We have a small window where the Republican Party, at least in theory, can still fund the border wall.
[01:50:21.342 --> 01:50:22.262]  But we know they won't.
[01:50:22.302 --> 01:50:23.043]  We should push them.
[01:50:23.503 --> 01:50:27.163]  But what Trump's going to have to do after that is that Bill Funning's going to come out of the House of Representatives.
[01:50:27.664 --> 01:50:31.924]  He's going to have to put the troops on the border and build the wall using the DOD resources.
[01:50:32.385 --> 01:50:33.445]  And we did it in Korea.
[01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:36.645]  We still man a massive border in Korea successfully.
[01:50:36.666 --> 01:50:38.646]  Between North and South Korea, we can do it here.
[01:50:39.086 --> 01:50:42.307]  So we want to push Trump to do the right thing using the military as commander-in-chief.
[01:50:42.327 --> 01:50:43.347]  That's what it's going to take.
[01:50:43.647 --> 01:50:45.368]  Well, you've been saying that for a few years.
[01:50:45.428 --> 01:50:47.770]  He's now saying, it's not a wall we need.
[01:50:47.790 --> 01:50:49.231]  We need that too with Constantinowire.
[01:50:49.251 --> 01:50:50.152]  It's better than a wall, right?
[01:50:50.432 --> 01:50:53.034]  What we need is, what we need is troops.
[01:50:54.115 --> 01:50:54.415]  We do.
[01:50:54.636 --> 01:50:55.676]  We need troops and a wall.
[01:50:56.517 --> 01:50:58.899]  The wall they've got planned, a 15-foot wall would be great.
[01:50:59.039 --> 01:51:01.121]  Or a 30-foot wall would be awesome.
[01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:05.264]  Right now... Why is it layers of Constantinowire?
[01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:06.325]  Isn't that cheaper and better?
[01:51:06.605 --> 01:51:07.646]  Say, four layers of it?
[01:51:08.126 --> 01:51:10.027]  When people chew through it, you just repair it.
[01:51:10.047 --> 01:51:10.528]  It can be cut.
[01:51:11.048 --> 01:51:11.608]  It can be cut.
[01:51:11.788 --> 01:51:17.569]  Any infantry guy will tell you, unless you monitor the barrier, it can be circumvented, including the wall.
[01:51:18.030 --> 01:51:18.830]  So it takes both.
[01:51:18.850 --> 01:51:26.671]  It takes barriers, it takes the troops, it takes sensors, it takes guys in helicopters as QRFs, it takes a roadway behind the walls they have in California.
[01:51:26.932 --> 01:51:27.712]  That's been done right.
[01:51:27.772 --> 01:51:28.772]  And now the U.N.
[01:51:28.792 --> 01:51:31.533]  has openly declared war on borders with these new treaties.
[01:51:31.613 --> 01:51:32.293]  I mean, my God.
[01:51:35.128 --> 01:51:35.889]  This is for all the marbles.
[01:51:35.929 --> 01:51:37.309]  This is for the survival of our nation.
[01:51:37.770 --> 01:52:03.947]  That's why, you know, we're going to do what we have to do to at least show our support for the president, to encourage him to go further, and the American people have got to rise up and demand and put boots on the ground with their own... By the way, I trust you and Oath Keepers, really smart guys to be down there as eyes and ears, but what about Southern Poverty Law Center ADL infiltrators posing as militia engaged in some sort of, you know, criminal event to...
[01:52:05.388 --> 01:52:07.490]  Defame Trump, defame Oath Keepers.
[01:52:07.530 --> 01:52:08.490]  You've got to be worried about that.
[01:52:09.451 --> 01:52:10.692]  Well sure, we'll bet people.
[01:52:10.712 --> 01:52:12.273]  I mean, we're going to rely heavily on air.
[01:52:12.893 --> 01:52:15.495]  Our big game changer is volunteer pilots.
[01:52:15.515 --> 01:52:19.697]  We've already got volunteer pilots stacked up to go out and fly over the border.
[01:52:20.538 --> 01:52:28.123]  That's where you have the best use of resources is to put pilots in the air, spot report for Border Patrol from the air.
[01:52:28.543 --> 01:52:32.946]  We're also going to use drones, and then we'll have our select guys, guys who are most experienced,
[01:52:33.426 --> 01:52:37.430]  Can you believe though everything you and I talked about decades ago is now mainstream?
[01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:41.254]  They don't even debate us about world government or trying to overthrow our borders.
[01:52:41.314 --> 01:52:42.575]  It's now just like out in the open.
[01:52:57.051 --> 01:53:01.394]  Yep, it's a cloud-driven strategy applied, as we saw in Europe, as being done right now.
[01:53:01.414 --> 01:53:08.658]  It's being applied here to swamp us with the third world and transform our nation and steal electoral power permanently.
[01:53:09.058 --> 01:53:13.461]  There'll be illegitimate power taken by the Democratic Party as a permanent block on power.
[01:53:13.481 --> 01:53:14.001]  That's what they want.
[01:53:15.436 --> 01:53:21.424]  So to stop it, though, we have to get behind the president, and I think it's going to take a boots on the ground to say, look, this is not enough.
[01:53:21.444 --> 01:53:24.468]  It's a good start, putting the military down a support role.
[01:53:24.708 --> 01:53:29.575]  But all they're doing is backing up the Border Patrol agents on the checkpoints, on the crossing points.
[01:53:29.695 --> 01:53:30.476]  They're not in between.
[01:53:30.496 --> 01:53:31.437]  They're not out there.
[01:53:32.098 --> 01:53:32.499]  I've seen it.
[01:53:33.059 --> 01:53:35.059]  Let me ask you this with all your sources.
[01:53:35.099 --> 01:53:37.020]  We have a lot of sources obviously down there with us.
[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:42.521]  We've had Greg Reese and some unnamed reporters for their safety in Mexico for two weeks.
[01:53:43.361 --> 01:53:49.002]  And the Mexicans finally got mad and made the six or seven thousand go to a sports stadium 40 miles south of Tijuana.
[01:53:49.503 --> 01:53:56.024]  They are now deporting hundreds a day and are really starting to put the screws to them to not let the rest of the caravan get up there because they get
[01:53:56.604 --> 01:54:01.728]  For their own country, how out of control it is to breach their own southern border with Guatemala and Honduras.
[01:54:02.649 --> 01:54:05.611]  But again, Soros isn't going to stop.
[01:54:06.192 --> 01:54:10.195]  What about what Lou Dobbs said, or the Tijuana mayor said?
[01:54:10.235 --> 01:54:12.157]  He said, arrest these NGOs!
[01:54:12.457 --> 01:54:14.098]  They're smuggling kids, man!
[01:54:14.538 --> 01:54:17.141]  This is total illegal border crossing.
[01:54:17.341 --> 01:54:24.887]  So the Mexicans, even the Federales are saying, it's time to arrest these organizers out of Chicago.
[01:54:26.238 --> 01:54:26.758]  Absolutely.
[01:54:26.778 --> 01:54:31.562]  I mean, they're all guilty that there's a federal statute against aiding and abetting illegal aliens.
[01:54:31.702 --> 01:54:33.063]  It's a federal felony.
[01:54:33.443 --> 01:54:35.525]  So I don't understand why it's not happening right now.
[01:54:35.745 --> 01:54:38.067]  That's what should be happening is arrests and prosecutions.
[01:54:38.407 --> 01:54:38.867]  Absolutely.
[01:54:39.328 --> 01:54:40.348]  And you're a constitutional lawyer.
[01:54:40.388 --> 01:54:42.850]  Well, Trump gives the orders, we now know, and they don't follow them.
[01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:44.031]  So this is mutiny.
[01:54:44.652 --> 01:54:47.274]  I mean, the low-level people are all great, but it's the bureaucrats.
[01:54:47.574 --> 01:54:48.955]  The lawyers aren't following the president.
[01:54:50.672 --> 01:54:51.433]  He needs a clean house.
[01:54:51.613 --> 01:54:52.794]  He needs to drain that swamp first.
[01:54:53.174 --> 01:54:56.217]  He can't drain the rest of it unless you have a prosecutorial team that'll do your work.
[01:54:56.497 --> 01:54:57.979]  Otherwise, you're dead in the water.
[01:54:57.999 --> 01:54:59.921]  So he's gotta drain that swamp first.
[01:55:00.281 --> 01:55:01.882]  But meanwhile, he should put the military on the border.
[01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:03.790]  As we do with Pershing.
[01:55:04.170 --> 01:55:12.832]  Pershing did an expedition, a penitentiary expedition into Mexico, chased down Pancho Villa, and that was all done by the President of the United States as a commander-in-chief of the nation.
[01:55:13.212 --> 01:55:14.513]  And Trump could do the exact same thing.
[01:55:15.233 --> 01:55:18.954]  And they always, I mean, Mexico has control of its southern border, or is trying to.
[01:55:19.314 --> 01:55:21.534]  If the UN can break our border, it's over.
[01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:24.275]  And it's not like you're here in some position of hating Mexicans.
[01:55:24.335 --> 01:55:25.675]  I mean, your mom is from Mexico.
[01:55:27.095 --> 01:55:29.796]  Well, no, my grandfather... Grandpa, but your mom's Hispanic.
[01:55:30.871 --> 01:55:31.251]  That's right.
[01:55:31.652 --> 01:55:32.852]  Yeah, it's not a racial issue.
[01:55:32.992 --> 01:55:33.893]  It's about assimilation.
[01:55:34.213 --> 01:55:35.154]  My family is assimilated.
[01:55:35.214 --> 01:55:38.276]  If someone can assimilate in the numbers it can be assimilated, great.
[01:55:38.636 --> 01:55:42.579]  But they're coming here, you know, they're flying the Honduran flag or the Mexican flag or any American flag.
[01:55:42.879 --> 01:55:43.539]  I don't want them here.
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.080]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:49.003]  They're coming here under UN control to break us.
[01:55:51.224 --> 01:55:51.404]  Right.
[01:55:51.424 --> 01:55:56.591]  They're coming here as a fourth-generation warfare force multiplier for the globalists.
[01:55:56.872 --> 01:56:03.120]  It's a military invasion and a political coup by the left in this country and by the globalists.
[01:56:03.921 --> 01:56:05.683]  So, you know, we've got to stand up and oppose it.
[01:56:06.084 --> 01:56:07.245]  I don't care where they come from.
[01:56:07.265 --> 01:56:09.148]  If they're coming here for those purposes, I don't want them here.
[01:56:09.804 --> 01:56:17.669]  Well, clearly they've escalated, and now they use Antifa as their decoys to laze conservative and nationalist and patriot targets, as you predicted.
[01:56:18.029 --> 01:56:23.593]  I've confirmed, my own self, but also from really smart sources, that the left has a backup plan.
[01:56:23.633 --> 01:56:30.377]  If they can't stop Trump, they are planning national assassination, basically day, coming up in the future.
[01:56:30.698 --> 01:56:35.881]  That's why everybody who is a major patriot leader should know, this is maximum alert time right now.
[01:56:35.921 --> 01:56:37.282]  Stuart, you want to comment to that information?
[01:56:38.365 --> 01:56:43.009]  Absolutely, and in fact, we'll be at General Flynn's upcoming hearing in D.C.
[01:56:43.149 --> 01:56:45.071]  We're going to be there to counter Antifa.
[01:56:45.572 --> 01:56:50.416]  I'm sending some of my best retired police officers and infantry veterans there, just in case.
[01:56:50.976 --> 01:56:52.538]  Because that's what's going to happen.
[01:56:52.578 --> 01:56:53.619]  Eventually, they'll go kinetic.
[01:56:54.239 --> 01:56:54.820]  I think they will.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:57.362]  Well, they said they are, because they're losing.
[01:56:58.243 --> 01:56:59.864]  Stuart Rhodes, OathKeepers.org.
[01:56:59.925 --> 01:57:00.925]  Big announcement's coming soon.
[01:57:00.945 --> 01:57:02.547]  And you're going to be in the studio with us tomorrow, right?
[01:57:03.628 --> 01:57:04.008]  Absolutely.
[01:57:04.028 --> 01:57:04.669]  Look forward to it.
[01:57:05.259 --> 01:57:05.859]  All right, Stewart.
[01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.481]  OathKeepers.org.
[01:57:07.621 --> 01:57:09.062]  God bless you and be safe down there.
[01:57:10.563 --> 01:57:10.883]  You too.
[01:57:10.903 --> 01:57:11.283]  God bless.
[01:57:11.323 --> 01:57:11.603]  Thank you.
[01:57:11.824 --> 01:57:12.124]  All right.
[01:57:12.244 --> 01:57:19.429]  We're going to come back, and we've got a full hour to take your phone calls.
[01:57:21.390 --> 01:57:24.932]  I did something last night on the Sunday Show that I thought was a good idea.
[01:57:26.674 --> 01:57:30.576]  We have digital lines, so potentially we could take thousands of calls.
[01:57:30.656 --> 01:57:32.478]  We got 24,000 calls one time in two hours.
[01:57:32.498 --> 01:57:34.179]  A lot of folks calling back and back.
[01:57:35.410 --> 01:57:37.151]  Well, I don't want to make you sit on hold.
[01:57:38.152 --> 01:57:46.558]  So what we're going to do is, we'll just take the first 10, get them up there, and then not take more calls till they're gone, so you don't sit on hold.
[01:57:47.038 --> 01:57:49.900]  So open phones and a ton of news in the third hour.
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:50.340]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.421 --> 01:57:58.866]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[01:58:00.578 --> 01:58:02.020]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:07.205]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[01:58:08.366 --> 01:58:14.293]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[01:58:15.053 --> 01:58:22.721]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[01:58:23.482 --> 01:58:49.663]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[01:58:50.899 --> 01:58:57.220]  We are losing money on this, but we're gonna help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[01:58:57.660 --> 01:58:59.401]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[01:58:59.481 --> 01:59:04.401]  I love my state, but if you got a business and a company here and you got merchandise, BS.
[01:59:04.862 --> 01:59:05.362]  It's big.
[01:59:05.902 --> 01:59:06.322]  It's bad.
[01:59:06.762 --> 01:59:11.983]  So, we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[01:59:12.003 --> 01:59:14.283]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[01:59:14.723 --> 01:59:17.924]  So, to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[01:59:18.544 --> 01:59:19.505]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:59:19.545 --> 01:59:20.706]  That's been going on for over a month.
[01:59:21.467 --> 01:59:22.688]  50 to 75% off.
[01:59:22.728 --> 01:59:23.708]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[01:59:24.813 --> 01:59:25.733]  The Double Patriot Points.
[01:59:25.753 --> 01:59:26.674]  That's what's happening in about a week.
[01:59:27.034 --> 01:59:33.656]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[01:59:34.117 --> 01:59:38.498]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:59:38.518 --> 01:59:40.399]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[01:59:40.659 --> 01:59:42.480]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:44.721]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:44.881 --> 01:59:48.902]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[01:59:54.710 --> 01:59:58.835]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.356 --> 02:00:00.698]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.885 --> 02:00:09.630]  Coming up at Global Exclusive, Dr. Jerome Corsi's lawyer joins us.
[02:00:09.670 --> 02:00:11.873]  They just filed criminal charges against Mueller, but first...
[02:00:18.522 --> 02:00:20.563]  Harrison Smith for InfoWars.com.
[02:00:20.603 --> 02:00:36.234]  We know that social media often deletes people or content based on arbitrary metrics and vague sort of enforcement rules, but what would it be like to have your constitutional rights, your God-given rights, subject to the same sort of arbitrary enforcement?
[02:00:36.274 --> 02:00:43.759]  Well, that would, in effect, be the purpose of the bill recently put forward for a vote in the New York State Senate by
[02:00:44.159 --> 02:00:46.280]  New York State Senator Kevin S. Parker.
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:01:00.348]  He calls for the Second Amendment for the right to own guns to be limited and to be subject to a review of your social media and your search engine history for the past three years.
[02:01:00.428 --> 02:01:03.230]  The government will go in and look at your search engine
[02:01:03.670 --> 02:01:20.574]  History and your social media posts looking for quote commonly used profane slurs or biased language used to describe the race color national origin ancestry gender religion religious practice age disability or sexual orientation of a person folks.
[02:01:20.854 --> 02:01:26.155]  This is the slow creeping death knell of
[02:01:27.338 --> 02:01:28.378]  Totalitarianism.
[02:01:28.678 --> 02:01:34.920]  This is Chinese-style social censorship getting its foot in the door in America.
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:42.282]  Of course they would do it in New York State, in a very liberal place, to try to set the precedent that they can expand out to the rest of America.
[02:01:42.722 --> 02:01:44.563]  Folks, this is insane.
[02:01:44.983 --> 02:01:45.863]  This is outrageous.
[02:01:46.283 --> 02:01:47.924]  The fact that your free speech
[02:01:48.823 --> 02:02:04.733]  Your search engine results and your social media posts, and not just the public posts, this bill actually calls for you having to turn over your username and password to the police in order to qualify for owning a gun, for exercising the Second Amendment.
[02:02:05.393 --> 02:02:05.473]  And
[02:02:23.604 --> 02:02:24.164]  We're good to go.
[02:02:48.812 --> 02:02:56.958]  Get bills like this passed and put a nice little spin on it and say, well, we've had these massacres and the people, you know, they posted on social media beforehand.
[02:02:57.038 --> 02:03:04.483]  So, you know, maybe we need to review people's social media to decide whether or not they're worthy of exercising their right to bear arms.
[02:03:04.823 --> 02:03:05.424]  There's a reason.
[02:03:06.044 --> 02:03:09.565]  That the Founding Fathers used the phrase, shall not be infringed.
[02:03:09.845 --> 02:03:13.186]  They knew that the right to bear arms would not be destroyed all at once.
[02:03:13.226 --> 02:03:21.689]  It will be infringed, slowly but surely nibbled away at until we wake up one day to find that we are completely defenseless in the face of a totalitarian government.
[02:03:21.869 --> 02:03:29.171]  That is exactly what's happening here and they're starting it at this spot, right here at Kevin S. Parker's office in Brooklyn, New York.
[02:03:31.181 --> 02:03:35.323]  Folks, we know how they do things.
[02:03:35.463 --> 02:03:38.865]  We know that if you criticize George Soros, they'll call you anti-Semitic.
[02:03:39.366 --> 02:03:44.509]  We know that if you just talk about Alex Jones, you risk having your video or your account banned.
[02:03:45.149 --> 02:03:57.296]  Well, very soon, it's not hard to foresee a time when criticizing people like George Soros or the Rothschilds will be called anti-Semitism and be grounds for you not being able to exercise your rights.
[02:03:57.956 --> 02:04:00.379]  Not even China is at that level yet.
[02:04:00.439 --> 02:04:09.228]  Yet that is the purpose of this bill put forward by Kevin S. Parker of Brooklyn, New York.
[02:04:09.869 --> 02:04:11.871]  And again, they're not making a big deal out of this.
[02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:12.832]  They're not doing this.
[02:04:13.232 --> 02:04:14.533]  Uh, in a conservative state.
[02:04:14.553 --> 02:04:19.877]  They're doing this in a liberal state where they hope that people are too dumbed down and too unconnected and too unaware.
[02:04:20.118 --> 02:04:22.179]  They aren't going to realize that this is happening.
[02:04:22.199 --> 02:04:23.380]  They're going to pass it quietly.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:33.008]  And by doing that, they're going to set the president that they can then expand to all other states and to all other rights guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution.
[02:04:33.208 --> 02:04:34.089]  This is outrageous.
[02:04:34.349 --> 02:04:35.489]  This is ridiculous.
[02:04:35.749 --> 02:04:39.632]  This should, as I say, be infuriating to each and every one of you.
[02:04:39.872 --> 02:04:50.518]  Folks, call your congressmen, call your senators, call your state senators and your state legislature and make it known that this is unacceptable and that this will not stand.
[02:04:51.138 --> 02:04:52.999]  For InfoWars.com, this has been Harrison Smith.
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:55.441]  Powerful info.
[02:04:55.561 --> 02:04:58.202]  It's George Soros that's anti-Israel and anti-Semitic.
[02:04:58.522 --> 02:05:00.744]  Larry Klainman joins us with huge news in one minute.
[02:05:00.784 --> 02:05:01.144]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.018 --> 02:05:09.042]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:05:09.403 --> 02:05:12.005]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:05:12.625 --> 02:05:16.068]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:16.328 --> 02:05:20.591]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:21.031 --> 02:05:24.273]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:25.194 --> 02:05:35.420]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:44.725]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:46.366 --> 02:05:54.891]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[02:05:55.391 --> 02:05:59.694]  Try Bodies today at InfoWarsLife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:14.207 --> 02:06:18.291]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:19.112 --> 02:06:20.674]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.115 --> 02:06:31.044]  Well, he's the head of FreedomWatchUSA.org, former head of Judicial Watch, the guy that helped start the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the guy that got the only win against the NSA.
[02:06:31.084 --> 02:06:32.606]  He's with us one segment.
[02:06:32.626 --> 02:06:33.807]  Let me get the number out and take your calls.
[02:06:34.268 --> 02:06:35.008]  Larry Klayman!
[02:06:35.994 --> 02:06:39.836]  Representing formerinfowars.com, reporter Dr. Jerome Corsi.
[02:06:40.437 --> 02:06:41.557]  Corsi goes to war!
[02:06:41.958 --> 02:06:44.159]  Prosecute Miller, staff for criminal acts.
[02:06:44.779 --> 02:06:47.581]  I'm no lawyer, but when you tell somebody, say this, they're gonna go to jail.
[02:06:47.601 --> 02:06:48.281]  It's not true.
[02:06:48.321 --> 02:06:48.802]  That's criminal.
[02:06:49.182 --> 02:06:55.005]  Conservative writer Corsi files criminal complaint against Mueller, alleges bid to seek false testimony.
[02:06:55.025 --> 02:06:55.706]  And then there's this.
[02:06:56.186 --> 02:06:57.467]  Here's Trump's tweet from earlier today.
[02:06:57.487 --> 02:06:58.948]  We had Roger Stone on earlier.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.261]  I will never testify against Trump.
[02:07:01.341 --> 02:07:11.827]  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out-of-control prosecutor, who thinks he's God, to make up lies and stories about President Trump.
[02:07:11.927 --> 02:07:15.610]  Nice to know that some people still have guts.
[02:07:15.650 --> 02:07:16.610]  Joining us is Larry Klayman.
[02:07:16.630 --> 02:07:18.151]  Thanks for coming on on short notice.
[02:07:18.532 --> 02:07:19.912]  This is a big deal.
[02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:20.833]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:07:21.713 --> 02:07:23.054]  Alex, I appreciate you too.
[02:07:23.114 --> 02:07:23.755]  You have guts.
[02:07:23.835 --> 02:07:25.456]  There are very few of us anymore that do.
[02:07:26.221 --> 02:07:36.758]  But this is a very important case, because I have now filed a complaint on behalf of Dr. Corsi with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, with the U.S.
[02:07:36.818 --> 02:07:40.725]  Attorney in the District of Columbia, with the Criminal Division of the Justice Department.
[02:07:41.388 --> 02:07:45.610]  With the Office of Professional Responsibility, Inspector General, and with the D.C.
[02:07:45.650 --> 02:07:47.211]  Bar's Disciplinary Council.
[02:07:47.231 --> 02:07:53.935]  It'll be interesting to see what they do because they're run by leftists who've donated heavily to various Democrat campaigns.
[02:07:54.295 --> 02:07:58.637]  But we have a real shot at the Justice Department to get an investigation.
[02:07:59.018 --> 02:08:01.219]  Of course, it's under the control of Matthew Whitaker now.
[02:08:01.819 --> 02:08:10.904]  And we're asking that Mueller and his staff, the ones that were involved, Jeannie Rhee, Aaron Zelinsky, Mark Goldstein, and one other,
[02:08:11.553 --> 02:08:11.954]  We're good to go.
[02:08:26.482 --> 02:08:31.386]  Well, I mean, most listeners know the details, but they're so voluminous, it's hard to... there's so many.
[02:08:32.027 --> 02:08:38.332]  Go over, like, Tarmac meetings and Hillary and Uranium One and then Jeanne Wray's involved in covering up.
[02:08:38.352 --> 02:08:39.333]  The other lawyers are.
[02:08:39.373 --> 02:08:43.896]  It's like... It's like if there was a Nuremberg trial and Hitler was the judge against the Nazis.
[02:08:43.936 --> 02:08:45.638]  I mean, that's how crazy this is.
[02:08:47.182 --> 02:08:49.663]  Well, yeah, crazy is a nice way of putting it.
[02:08:49.683 --> 02:08:51.685]  You're being very polite, Alex.
[02:08:52.465 --> 02:08:53.005]  It's criminal.
[02:08:53.045 --> 02:08:53.766]  That's what it is.
[02:08:54.426 --> 02:08:57.628]  This is an attempted coup d'etat against the President of the United States.
[02:08:57.688 --> 02:09:03.071]  Anybody that gets caught in between, such as Dr. Corsi or Roger Stone or others,
[02:09:03.712 --> 02:09:06.475]  Are destroyed unless they're going to testify falsely.
[02:09:07.155 --> 02:09:15.143]  And with regard to Dr. Corsi, I don't represent Roger Stone, but these people are being backed up against the wall, backed into a corner.
[02:09:15.664 --> 02:09:18.606]  And either they lie or they get indicted.
[02:09:19.107 --> 02:09:20.909]  And obviously, this isn't going to stand.
[02:09:20.949 --> 02:09:25.453]  Dr. Corsi had been offered what the special counsel called a sweetheart plea deal.
[02:09:26.234 --> 02:09:27.175]  And he had the courage.
[02:09:28.001 --> 02:09:30.683]  And he had the temerity to reject that.
[02:09:31.204 --> 02:09:38.449]  He is now going up against the most powerful Justice Department person in the United States and perhaps of all time.
[02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:43.133]  And I just hope that the law and ethics prevails.
[02:09:43.173 --> 02:09:45.155]  I'm going to do everything I can to protect him.
[02:09:45.595 --> 02:09:46.716]  It would be very unwise.
[02:09:47.552 --> 02:09:50.053]  Well, that was my next question because you're a smart constitutional lawyer.
[02:09:50.093 --> 02:09:56.016]  How do they act like Mueller's God and he can do whatever he wants and it goes on forever and even CNN admits he breaks all the rules?
[02:10:09.423 --> 02:10:17.292]  And then there's no Russiagate and it just goes on year after year and then the president who's a separate branch of government has to answer to him.
[02:10:17.312 --> 02:10:20.055]  I mean, what is going on here?
[02:10:22.218 --> 02:10:25.522]  What's going on here is that the world has turned into a war.
[02:10:26.357 --> 02:10:28.097]  By the left against the right.
[02:10:28.138 --> 02:10:28.598]  You know that.
[02:10:28.838 --> 02:10:30.478]  You've been a victim of that, okay?
[02:10:30.818 --> 02:10:32.959]  I have to deal with it on a daily basis as well.
[02:10:33.079 --> 02:10:38.700]  Everybody does, who's a conservative, who speaks out, who takes positions, is that they want to destroy all of us.
[02:10:39.300 --> 02:10:42.061]  And of course, the President's the number one guy they want to destroy.
[02:10:42.101 --> 02:10:42.881]  So how do you do that?
[02:10:43.502 --> 02:10:48.463]  You go to people like Corsi and Stone, and you get them to testify falsely.
[02:10:49.063 --> 02:10:49.983]  That's the way it works.
[02:10:50.103 --> 02:10:51.104]  And Mueller is out of control.
[02:10:51.124 --> 02:10:52.664]  You know, there's this big argument that
[02:10:53.802 --> 02:10:56.904]  Matthew Whitaker, the acting Attorney General, should have been confirmed by the Senate.
[02:10:56.924 --> 02:10:59.666]  Well, Mueller should have been confirmed by the Senate, constitutionally.
[02:10:59.726 --> 02:11:00.887]  He has no authority.
[02:11:01.547 --> 02:11:05.330]  So, should Dr. Quinn... That's a really good point.
[02:11:05.370 --> 02:11:07.211]  I saw you make that on The War Room the other day.
[02:11:07.991 --> 02:11:14.916]  He's not been confirmed, and they literally, like, fall down and worship this man with this huge history of corruption.
[02:11:16.294 --> 02:11:19.135]  Talk about acting as an Attorney General without being confirmed.
[02:11:19.675 --> 02:11:20.455]  That's Robert Mueller.
[02:11:20.475 --> 02:11:24.936]  And of course he had this hack, Rod Rosenstein, rubber stamp everything he wanted.
[02:11:24.956 --> 02:11:35.557]  And just the other day with regard to the indictment of Cohen, of Michael Cohen, Mueller went to Rosenstein before he went to the person who's in charge, Whitaker.
[02:11:36.138 --> 02:11:38.618]  And Rosenstein has no authority anymore on this.
[02:11:38.638 --> 02:11:39.618]  He's been taken off of it.
[02:11:39.638 --> 02:11:40.618]  So that tells you everything.
[02:11:40.638 --> 02:11:44.319]  They're going to their guys that want to destroy this president.
[02:11:47.492 --> 02:11:53.477]  And clearly they're raiding lawyers that have nothing to do with Russia, trying to find some dirt on them.
[02:11:54.798 --> 02:12:03.085]  If you were Trump, because I know Trump pays attention to this broadcast, and I see OAN behind you pays attention to that, and, you know, the trickle up, you know, Fox listens to us.
[02:12:04.265 --> 02:12:06.388]  What would you do if you were the president right now?
[02:12:06.448 --> 02:12:08.290]  Because this country's in clear and present danger.
[02:12:08.730 --> 02:12:13.295]  You have Mueller and you have Hillary involved with the Russians and trying to blame everybody else.
[02:12:13.895 --> 02:12:16.959]  What would you do when they're trying to overthrow an election, trying to do this?
[02:12:16.979 --> 02:12:19.461]  I mean, at some point it becomes a dereliction of duty.
[02:12:19.481 --> 02:12:21.403]  Here's what I'm saying.
[02:12:21.423 --> 02:12:25.007]  The president tweeted last Monday that he's getting ready to take the gloves off.
[02:12:25.027 --> 02:12:25.968]  There should be treason trials.
[02:12:26.008 --> 02:12:26.489]  Then he said,
[02:12:27.833 --> 02:12:30.194]  I've got all the proof of your crimes, which we know they've got.
[02:12:30.234 --> 02:12:32.975]  The NSA's got Hillary's 35,000 emails.
[02:12:33.435 --> 02:12:35.075]  We know that they've got all the dirt.
[02:12:35.115 --> 02:12:39.477]  We know they have the illegal information that they put out the lies to get the FISA warrant.
[02:12:39.877 --> 02:12:41.618]  So the President's letting them know he has this.
[02:12:42.038 --> 02:12:42.918]  I don't want to second-guess him.
[02:12:42.938 --> 02:12:46.099]  He's a really smart guy, but shouldn't he just drop the bombs now?
[02:12:47.219 --> 02:12:49.300]  He should, Alex, and we've been saying that all along.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.501]  Three things he should do, primarily.
[02:12:51.541 --> 02:12:53.701]  Number one, he is the head of the Justice Department.
[02:12:53.721 --> 02:12:55.002]  He's head of the Executive Branch.
[02:12:55.723 --> 02:13:04.227]  He can't tell the Justice Department to indict people, but he can tell them to investigate, and he can order an investigation, and he can himself order a special counsel.
[02:13:04.727 --> 02:13:05.487]  He should do that.
[02:13:06.087 --> 02:13:10.929]  Number two, he should challenge Mueller's authority and take it all the way up to the Supreme Court.
[02:13:10.969 --> 02:13:12.210]  He has a great shot to do that.
[02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:13.571]  He's President of the United States.
[02:13:13.631 --> 02:13:14.211]  Number three,
[02:13:14.891 --> 02:13:18.214]  He should be bringing lawsuits, as I did, against the NSA.
[02:13:18.234 --> 02:13:19.535]  You made reference to that earlier.
[02:13:20.015 --> 02:13:26.080]  The CIA, the FBI, for the illegal surveillance of the Trump Tower, himself, his family, and his colleagues.
[02:13:26.681 --> 02:13:33.826]  He should fight back, but he's been getting this bad advice from his lawyers who are telling him, like court jesters, everything's going to be okay.
[02:13:33.866 --> 02:13:36.208]  You know, they're telling the king, don't worry about it.
[02:13:36.228 --> 02:13:40.992]  And what they're really doing is covering their ass so they don't get indicted by Mueller on taxes they didn't pay.
[02:13:41.809 --> 02:13:42.509]  Well, could be.
[02:13:42.889 --> 02:13:43.890]  Who knows what Mueller's got.
[02:13:43.930 --> 02:13:47.411]  Look, there's surveillance on everybody, Alex.
[02:13:47.451 --> 02:13:47.991]  We know that.
[02:13:48.211 --> 02:13:57.434]  And, you know, if they want to get the lawyers or they want to get this person or that person, you know, they will do it and they'll manufacture claims to use against them.
[02:13:57.454 --> 02:13:58.954]  We can see that with Dr. Corsi.
[02:13:59.634 --> 02:14:01.415]  So this is the world we live in today.
[02:14:01.995 --> 02:14:03.255]  It's them versus us.
[02:14:03.295 --> 02:14:05.496]  We're trying to fight back peacefully and legally.
[02:14:07.098 --> 02:14:32.519]  Well, I agree, but the courage it takes for you, who's like the perennial guy of courage, I'm not just saying it's true, you're always, I've been on there 20-something years, it's always you at the center of the fight, God bless you, and of course he's a great guy as well, I don't get into current client privilege, but just in the last minute and a half, the conversation or deciding to go ahead and do the criminal complaint, even if it goes nowhere, it's standing up against the tyrant, it's saying, you're a fraud, I know you are, it's not groveling.
[02:14:33.550 --> 02:14:37.574]  Well, and we'll also take it to court to seek to have it enforced if they do nothing.
[02:14:37.615 --> 02:14:40.157]  And I hope that people will go to Dr. Corsi's website.
[02:14:40.197 --> 02:14:49.708]  I'm representing him in my private capacity here, thecorsination.com, and donate to his defense fund because he's really standing up, not just for himself, but for everybody.
[02:14:49.728 --> 02:14:53.312]  And this is the one chance that we have to take Mueller down legally.
[02:14:54.761 --> 02:14:59.443]  Well, I mean, I've gotten mad at him just because some of his recollections aren't mine, but overall he's saying the same thing.
[02:14:59.684 --> 02:15:01.825]  And I really admire Corsi overall.
[02:15:02.305 --> 02:15:06.767]  But yeah, the craziness of them openly telling him to lie or he'll go to prison.
[02:15:06.947 --> 02:15:10.749]  Just the bravado, the chutzpah, the arrogance.
[02:15:10.789 --> 02:15:11.950]  What do you call this word?
[02:15:13.951 --> 02:15:16.292]  Well, chutzpah's a nice way of saying it again, Alex.
[02:15:16.332 --> 02:15:17.532]  You're again being diplomatic.
[02:15:17.552 --> 02:15:17.932]  Criminality.
[02:15:18.072 --> 02:15:18.533]  It's criminal.
[02:15:18.973 --> 02:15:23.875]  And what they also said, Jeanne Rhee told them to keep the plea agreement confidential, and he can't do that.
[02:15:23.915 --> 02:15:25.075]  He's a securities dealer.
[02:15:25.115 --> 02:15:28.916]  If he had pled to one count for a felony violation, he would have to report it.
[02:15:28.936 --> 02:15:35.699]  So that was another crime committed by the special counsel's office to keep that information away from federal regulators for securities.
[02:15:37.799 --> 02:15:39.320]  No, but you said it.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:42.161]  It's wild-eyed, megalomaniac criminality.
[02:15:43.473 --> 02:15:52.944]  But it is, and you know, this is where we, this is what we've come to as a nation, and this is why I'm trying so hard to do it in the courts, to do it legally.
[02:15:53.564 --> 02:15:55.667]  Matthew Whitaker has to step up to the plate.
[02:15:55.727 --> 02:15:56.287]  He does.
[02:15:56.568 --> 02:15:57.989]  Larry Klainman, thank you so much.
[02:15:58.029 --> 02:15:59.010]  Freedom Watch USA.
[02:15:59.050 --> 02:15:59.511]  God bless you.
[02:15:59.531 --> 02:16:00.132]  We'll be right back.

[02:17:42.868 --> 02:17:50.738]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfoWarStore.com is our bestseller, Brain Force Plus, now 55% off.
[02:17:51.098 --> 02:17:53.762]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[02:17:54.222 --> 02:17:58.948]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWar possible.
[02:17:59.328 --> 02:18:01.251]  Again, you are the resistance.
[02:18:05.902 --> 02:18:14.367]  I've been on air 23 plus years, and I've learned a lot about sales, because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and our way of life.
[02:18:15.188 --> 02:18:19.770]  I was never classically trained, but over the last 23 years, I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[02:18:20.471 --> 02:18:25.734]  And there's lots of philosophies about have something really, really expensive, and a certain percentage will buy it, believing it's the best.
[02:18:26.534 --> 02:18:27.455]  That's not what I do.
[02:18:28.255 --> 02:18:30.797]  I try to find the very best products that are popular,
[02:18:31.677 --> 02:18:34.518]  Get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[02:18:34.598 --> 02:18:35.778]  That seems to be like common sense.
[02:18:35.898 --> 02:18:44.179]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[02:18:44.199 --> 02:18:51.480]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, Water Filtration, Gravity Fetch systems, because they're the very best.
[02:18:51.601 --> 02:18:56.241]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price, and so we are the biggest distributor.
[02:18:56.421 --> 02:18:59.462]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[02:19:00.302 --> 02:19:02.963]  Of 127 on that water filtration system.
[02:19:03.543 --> 02:19:05.144]  Because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[02:19:05.264 --> 02:19:06.484]  We sold out of it.
[02:19:06.504 --> 02:19:07.645]  They didn't think we could do it.
[02:19:08.265 --> 02:19:08.865]  You responded.
[02:19:08.885 --> 02:19:09.886]  You went and did your own research.
[02:19:10.146 --> 02:19:11.266]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[02:19:11.766 --> 02:19:16.468]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filtration four-stage ion filter.
[02:19:16.508 --> 02:19:20.049]  When they came to me five years ago and said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[02:19:20.069 --> 02:19:20.790]  We need competitors for $500, $600, $800, $1,000.
[02:19:20.890 --> 02:19:22.030]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[02:19:22.050 --> 02:19:22.850]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[02:19:22.890 --> 02:19:23.230]  I said, great!
[02:19:27.592 --> 02:19:28.073]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:19:28.113 --> 02:19:32.259]  I just bought filters for $400, $600, $700 that weren't even as good, so I knew it was a great deal.
[02:19:32.419 --> 02:19:36.345]  Now they've been able to lower the price because they've expanded how many they're having manufactured to $200.
[02:19:36.945 --> 02:19:40.631]  Ladies and gentlemen, at year-end, they're doing it again, just like they did with the water filter.
[02:19:40.791 --> 02:19:43.475]  The Alexa Pure Breeze 4-stage ion filter is now one
[02:19:43.715 --> 02:19:45.256]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:25.563 --> 02:20:29.168]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:20:29.629 --> 02:20:31.151]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.333 --> 02:20:35.618]  Alright, I want to play a few minutes here of what's basically live.
[02:20:35.698 --> 02:20:36.459]  I just saw it live.
[02:20:36.479 --> 02:20:38.081]  I had them pause it out there, Fox News.
[02:20:39.103 --> 02:20:40.886]  You've got Dana Perina.
[02:20:42.441 --> 02:21:03.719]  ...of the Perina Dog Food Company, up there, just worshipping Dick Cheney, this globalist New World Order guy, the right-wing worships, when he helped George Herbert Walker Bush, the anti-gunner, the open borders guy, the whole sellout to China, but Cheney always acts real tough, so everybody kisses his butt, but Cheney had a heart pump for two years.
[02:21:03.759 --> 02:21:06.742]  That's the longest-lived person ever had an outside heart.
[02:21:08.068 --> 02:21:12.216]  And then he got all these other hearts and he's still alive and looks better than he looked 30 years ago.
[02:21:12.838 --> 02:21:17.027]  Don't tell me there isn't life extension technologies for the establishment.
[02:21:18.134 --> 02:21:24.195]  But again, George Herbert Walker Bush made his money off his Nazi collaborator father.
[02:21:24.755 --> 02:21:27.416]  Then he told Saddam to invade Kuwait and set him up.
[02:21:28.036 --> 02:21:30.616]  Then he helped ship narcotics in, you know, before.
[02:21:31.036 --> 02:21:31.876]  It's just incredible.
[02:21:32.356 --> 02:21:33.917]  And then all his behavior.
[02:21:33.997 --> 02:21:35.317]  I'm so sick of him.
[02:21:35.637 --> 02:21:38.077]  I want to give the number out to listeners, though, separately from this.
[02:21:39.898 --> 02:21:42.878]  On globalism, I think really is dead.
[02:21:42.918 --> 02:21:44.159]  I think that's what we're seeing here.
[02:21:44.179 --> 02:21:45.539]  This is a archetype.
[02:21:45.619 --> 02:21:46.659]  This is a totem.
[02:21:48.010 --> 02:22:03.564]  A signet, a sign, a logos, a tea leaf, a portent, an omen of globalism being dead.
[02:22:04.605 --> 02:22:10.010]  We have the new world order losing every election except for Venezuela in here.
[02:22:11.846 --> 02:22:12.646]  In the last six years.
[02:22:14.287 --> 02:22:19.230]  We're the only election other than Venezuela that anti-globalists have lost in six years.
[02:22:22.112 --> 02:22:23.272]  Eight elections in Germany.
[02:22:23.592 --> 02:22:24.733]  Five elections in England.
[02:22:26.554 --> 02:22:27.615]  Three elections in Spain.
[02:22:27.675 --> 02:22:28.735]  Four elections in Italy.
[02:22:29.556 --> 02:22:32.837]  Multiple elections in Brazil.
[02:22:33.398 --> 02:22:34.358]  Should I keep going here?
[02:22:35.819 --> 02:22:37.960]  But magically here, we see total fraud.
[02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:38.801]  Oh, it didn't happen.
[02:22:39.261 --> 02:22:40.101]  Because of the fraud.
[02:22:40.542 --> 02:22:41.282]  Just like Venezuela.
[02:22:43.058 --> 02:22:52.361]  So I want to get your take on all of this and where you see this going and the riots happening in France by citizens.
[02:22:52.561 --> 02:22:59.243]  It's not a bunch of Islamists in their nightgowns that never had a job in their life, you know, walking around wiping their ass with their left hand or whatever they do.
[02:22:59.263 --> 02:23:02.044]  I mean, this is the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:02.064 --> 02:23:03.064]  This is people fighting back.
[02:23:03.104 --> 02:23:03.885]  This is humanity.
[02:23:03.905 --> 02:23:05.185]  And it's exciting.
[02:23:06.225 --> 02:23:07.606]  So the toll-free number to join us
[02:23:08.686 --> 02:23:08.906]  It's 877-789-ALEX.
[02:23:08.926 --> 02:23:08.966]  877-789-2539.
[02:23:08.986 --> 02:23:09.066]  877-877-789-2539.
[02:23:09.086 --> 02:23:09.206]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:23:21.374 --> 02:23:28.536]  And we'll get to everybody that calls, because instead of taking 30 calls that we can take on the board, we'll just take 10, let the others ring, when we're done with those, we'll get more.
[02:23:28.696 --> 02:23:34.097]  That way, nobody ends up getting cheated on their airtime, because I don't want people sitting on hold anymore.
[02:23:34.558 --> 02:23:43.100]  The Noah Benjamin, really hilarious, smart, really not even just a comedian now, since you're a comedian, but an analyst of mind control, of media manipulation.
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:52.671]  He'll be joining us coming up in the fourth hour ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer and Roger Stone, who Trump's been tweeting about today, saying, thank God somebody still got guts.
[02:23:55.635 --> 02:23:58.939]  You know, I love the fact that Trump doesn't give that guts comment to many people.
[02:24:02.782 --> 02:24:07.704]  I'm not a sycophantic person that worships power or prestige or people in the media.
[02:24:07.765 --> 02:24:15.508]  Most people in the media I hate, but Trump doesn't give the, you're a real man, you've got a lot of courage, I admire you, to a lot of people.
[02:24:18.410 --> 02:24:26.234]  And so I'll go ahead and say it, just to trigger the media that thinks I'm out here in Neverland and you've defeated me, which we have and our core audience is bigger than ever.
[02:24:26.794 --> 02:24:32.457]  Our reach is restricted to new people, which I hate because it's great to talk to folks that are awake all day long.
[02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:37.975]  What I really want to reach is new people.
[02:24:38.355 --> 02:24:40.435]  And we still reach a ton of them, but just not like before.
[02:24:40.515 --> 02:24:42.816]  It's, it's, that's, you know, I just tell the truth.
[02:24:42.836 --> 02:24:44.677]  People say, don't give them intel, it's true, man.
[02:24:44.697 --> 02:24:45.197]  You gotta, you know.
[02:24:45.217 --> 02:24:52.059]  The point is Trump has a lot of courage what he's doing.
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:56.301]  And Trump has
[02:24:58.487 --> 02:25:09.890]  Always sat there, and I've talked to him, or my wife's talked to him, or people I know that know Trump, bring it up, like, man, Jones got a lot of courage, put up with that crap, I see what they're doing, that means he's over the target.
[02:25:10.330 --> 02:25:17.531]  I really listen to him, because I know they really hate him, so that means, you know, I look into it all the time, and it's really accurate what he says, man, he's a smart guy.
[02:25:17.551 --> 02:25:22.673]  And it's just, I would not care if George Herbert Walker Bush said that to me, or George W. Bush.
[02:25:22.693 --> 02:25:24.073]  In fact, they even tried to.
[02:25:25.103 --> 02:25:31.287]  My sister went to school with the same school as the Bush daughters here in Austin, St.
[02:25:31.507 --> 02:25:31.848]  Andrews.
[02:25:32.748 --> 02:25:33.449]  She's younger than me.
[02:25:34.630 --> 02:25:41.814]  And so, even when I was in college, I'd go to the barbecue and there'd be George W. Bush when he was governor.
[02:25:45.037 --> 02:25:49.620]  And then I remember, like, federal marshals when he was already president-elect.
[02:25:50.842 --> 02:25:52.223]  Well, they were fighting over the election.
[02:25:52.323 --> 02:25:54.464]  It was about to be President-elect came down to the office.
[02:25:54.484 --> 02:26:05.571]  They said, he'll be watching tonight, George W. And all he's asking is that you say nice things about him tonight.
[02:26:07.032 --> 02:26:08.293]  He wants you to come to the Governor's Mansion.
[02:26:08.893 --> 02:26:11.174]  And it was like learning how to be a whore.
[02:26:11.214 --> 02:26:13.776]  And I said, so I went on that show that night and attacked the Bushes.
[02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:17.371]  And it was very easy to do.
[02:26:17.651 --> 02:26:18.332]  That's what I do.
[02:26:18.792 --> 02:26:21.754]  But these people collect humans like baseball cards.
[02:26:22.275 --> 02:26:23.495]  I'm not here to be collected.
[02:26:25.097 --> 02:26:36.565]  But with Trump being demonized and lied about and everything else, it's so real that I haven't been collected by Trump.
[02:26:36.905 --> 02:26:37.946]  We're together in the fight.
[02:26:43.940 --> 02:26:50.044]  And so I'm not going to say what Trump said to me privately many times, but let's just say this.
[02:26:50.705 --> 02:26:52.706]  We are definitely birds of a feather that fly together.
[02:26:54.067 --> 02:26:55.868]  And I know all the secrets.
[02:26:56.849 --> 02:26:57.830]  Without ever talking to Trump.
[02:26:59.050 --> 02:27:00.752]  Because my dad was just like his dad.
[02:27:02.073 --> 02:27:04.154]  And we were drinking from the very same well.
[02:27:06.976 --> 02:27:08.857]  So people say, how the hell are you guys so synced?
[02:27:09.358 --> 02:27:11.019]  We are spiritually synced.
[02:27:12.108 --> 02:27:13.549]  We're not fake Bible-thumpers.
[02:27:14.129 --> 02:27:14.790]  We love God.
[02:27:16.491 --> 02:27:19.893]  But we're not out to get people, and we don't like people suppressing people.
[02:27:20.773 --> 02:27:27.137]  And Trump was reading Western Goals by Congressman Larry McDonald for a decade.
[02:27:28.077 --> 02:27:31.319]  And so was I, when I was a little kid, while my dad was reading it.
[02:27:31.339 --> 02:27:41.145]  There'd be like an army colonel at the house, an FBI guy, and, you know, my dad would like be
[02:27:42.296 --> 02:27:46.818]  All this stuff going on and they were just all, they didn't want power.
[02:27:47.139 --> 02:27:48.279]  Those men didn't want power.
[02:27:48.319 --> 02:27:49.000]  They had power.
[02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:50.200]  They were powerful men.
[02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:51.381]  They were from powerful families.
[02:27:51.401 --> 02:27:52.561]  They were strong.
[02:27:52.882 --> 02:27:54.302]  They wanted to defend America.
[02:27:57.484 --> 02:28:08.610]  And so when I was 10 years old and five years old and hearing all this, Donald Trump was reading this and his lawyer, Roy Cohen, on the board of Western Gulfs, of heart,
[02:28:09.764 --> 02:28:09.984]  I don't
[02:28:25.239 --> 02:28:28.961]  And you're getting your uncle wounded off a C-130 at the Air Force Base.
[02:28:29.802 --> 02:28:33.624]  Or you're sitting around the table and a bunch of guys are sitting around talking about the country.
[02:28:34.144 --> 02:28:36.365]  You're listening to this and you know this isn't TV.
[02:28:36.906 --> 02:28:37.926]  This isn't the movies.
[02:28:37.986 --> 02:28:39.127]  This is the real thing.
[02:28:39.247 --> 02:28:39.948]  Your little ears go...
[02:28:41.088 --> 02:28:42.610]  You're listening to it just like Donald Trump did.
[02:28:42.890 --> 02:28:44.292]  He was a man when all this was happening.
[02:28:45.093 --> 02:28:47.515]  And he, Roy Cohen, told him everything.
[02:28:47.535 --> 02:28:48.736]  His dad already knew it all too.
[02:28:49.297 --> 02:28:58.307]  And so now they've got basically a John Birch Society president up there who knows how to fight all their tricks and their worst nightmares come true.
[02:28:58.327 --> 02:29:00.008]  That's why they're so freaked out.
[02:29:00.269 --> 02:29:01.310]  Everyone ask who he really is?
[02:29:09.119 --> 02:29:12.022]  What do you wanna do with your life?
[02:29:12.763 --> 02:29:13.584]  I wanna rock!
[02:29:16.647 --> 02:29:21.511]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[02:29:21.692 --> 02:29:28.098]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:29:33.663 --> 02:29:38.147]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[02:29:39.269 --> 02:29:41.591]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[02:29:41.771 --> 02:29:43.333]  I could end this guy, John, tomorrow.
[02:29:43.453 --> 02:29:45.855]  All you gotta do is arm all your best.
[02:29:46.155 --> 02:29:54.524]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[02:29:54.644 --> 02:29:55.324]  Where's the beat?
[02:29:55.665 --> 02:29:57.647]  Alright, what is the Trilateral Commission?
[02:29:58.712 --> 02:30:01.634]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[02:30:01.714 --> 02:30:10.118]  But you see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[02:30:10.138 --> 02:30:21.304]  To work to erase national boundaries, create an international community, and in time, bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[02:30:22.616 --> 02:30:39.386]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[02:30:39.646 --> 02:30:46.230]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[02:30:46.590 --> 02:30:47.713]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[02:30:47.953 --> 02:30:52.603]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[02:30:52.724 --> 02:30:57.354]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[02:30:58.445 --> 02:31:02.928]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[02:31:03.228 --> 02:31:07.391]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[02:31:07.431 --> 02:31:10.233]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[02:31:10.293 --> 02:31:17.818]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[02:31:18.098 --> 02:31:22.441]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[02:31:22.741 --> 02:31:28.045]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed this ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[02:31:29.139 --> 02:31:30.280]  I'm scared of these people.
[02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.402]  I'm very scared of them.
[02:31:33.522 --> 02:31:40.428]  How do you think the crackdrop gets into the country?
[02:31:40.448 --> 02:31:41.849]  We don't own any planes.
[02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:43.390]  We don't own no ships.
[02:31:43.650 --> 02:31:47.013]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[02:31:47.233 --> 02:31:53.878]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:31:56.113 --> 02:32:03.419]  The men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[02:32:03.519 --> 02:32:08.483]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[02:32:08.523 --> 02:32:15.588]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small airbase at Mena, Arkansas.
[02:32:16.029 --> 02:32:22.834]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-Contras
[02:32:23.394 --> 02:32:28.636]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[02:32:29.397 --> 02:32:35.319]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Contras, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[02:32:35.899 --> 02:32:40.901]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[02:32:41.101 --> 02:32:44.283]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[02:32:44.803 --> 02:32:47.464]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[02:32:48.164 --> 02:32:52.426]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[02:32:52.486 --> 02:32:52.767]  Lewinsky.
[02:32:53.367 --> 02:32:55.228]  These allegations are false.
[02:32:56.589 --> 02:33:02.132]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in the resistance.
[02:33:05.733 --> 02:33:08.395]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:43.851 --> 02:33:46.613]  Alright, we're going right to your phone calls, but I want to make this point right now.
[02:33:48.134 --> 02:34:07.947]  You can sit here and you can overanalyze and calculate and look at every point of the compass, but at the end of the day, the final equation, there are people that do things because they think it's the right thing to do, because they're honorable, and sometimes they get misled.
[02:34:10.029 --> 02:34:10.849]  And there are people
[02:34:12.421 --> 02:34:15.783]  That are a bunch of backstabbing, knuckle-dragging trash.
[02:34:16.863 --> 02:34:33.111]  And they're always white shoeboys that think they're slick and they all kiss each other's ass and talk crap about each other and angle and try to get in control of things they didn't build, instead of admiring those that built something and wanting to work with those people to build something greater.
[02:34:35.728 --> 02:34:42.651]  And when you realize that, you see the existential envy of the white shoe boy establishment and then right down to the third world.
[02:34:42.931 --> 02:34:44.272]  There's some great people in the third world.
[02:34:45.232 --> 02:34:46.213]  Great innovations there.
[02:34:47.213 --> 02:34:49.114]  But they don't want those people.
[02:34:49.154 --> 02:34:57.578]  They want the people that are attracted to the UN refugee camp and to the hating America and believe that you're going to get something free and to the criminals.
[02:35:00.034 --> 02:35:10.419]  And all I want to report to you is the dreams of people that I saw 30, 40 years ago who were concerned about where this country was going are alive today.
[02:35:11.239 --> 02:35:14.741]  And what they stood for and what they spoke about, they had no idea.
[02:35:16.055 --> 02:35:26.363]  They were handing out thousands of books a month, and literature, and warning people, and sitting right there with somebody that was three feet tall, watching.
[02:35:26.763 --> 02:35:28.805]  You never know where your real audience is, is my point.
[02:35:29.445 --> 02:35:30.706]  Sometimes it's right there.
[02:35:32.968 --> 02:35:33.388]  In the room.
[02:35:36.430 --> 02:35:40.753]  Sometimes the Godzilla that's gonna attack the globalists is right there, but it's little.
[02:35:41.134 --> 02:35:41.654]  It's a baby.
[02:35:41.834 --> 02:35:42.635]  Nobody sees it then.
[02:35:43.865 --> 02:35:46.987]  Because we're running around trying to wake the zombies up, which I still do.
[02:35:47.007 --> 02:35:52.250]  But more and more I realize it's about targeting the thinkers and reaching out to them.
[02:35:52.270 --> 02:35:55.592]  I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[02:35:55.672 --> 02:36:00.395]  It's just this, that it's bittersweet because we're under attack and that's not fun.
[02:36:00.415 --> 02:36:03.637]  Because we want to be here for the long haul.
[02:36:03.657 --> 02:36:04.318]  We want to be here.
[02:36:04.338 --> 02:36:11.422]  You know, it's like, you know, you get older, you don't fear death anymore, but you, you fear death because you want to be here for your children and your grandchildren.
[02:36:11.442 --> 02:36:13.023]  Like, what happens when I'm not here?
[02:36:16.604 --> 02:36:20.747]  I got over the fear of death a long time ago, but now I fear not being there for my children.
[02:36:20.767 --> 02:36:26.851]  Then there's the fear of doing this endangers your kids, but then you realize there's no future anyways if you don't do it.
[02:36:27.312 --> 02:36:30.774]  But then, you still try to figure out the right thing to do.
[02:36:30.794 --> 02:36:37.319]  I need you to sit back and think about the globalists who don't give a damn about anybody.
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:40.922]  What a horrible state that must be, but you know what?
[02:36:41.342 --> 02:36:42.864]  You can't sit there and feel sorry for them.
[02:36:43.624 --> 02:36:46.267]  We got a job to block them and get in their face.
[02:36:46.707 --> 02:36:51.811]  And you know, let them know, hey, you defile Jesus Christ, we defile you, Mueller.
[02:36:51.831 --> 02:36:54.874]  Everybody kisses your ass all day, you're a piece of crap.
[02:36:55.435 --> 02:36:56.475]  I'm gonna pull you down.
[02:36:57.016 --> 02:36:59.298]  Satanists want to defile Christ, I defile you.
[02:36:59.538 --> 02:37:00.319]  You're their God.
[02:37:00.399 --> 02:37:02.160]  I say, you're a piece of crap.
[02:37:03.021 --> 02:37:03.682]  They don't like that.
[02:37:05.029 --> 02:37:07.530]  Jesus Christ doesn't care if some devil worshiper hates him.
[02:37:07.770 --> 02:37:08.811]  He feels sorry for their soul.
[02:37:09.051 --> 02:37:14.474]  But these devils, they defile Christ because they wouldn't like that being done to them.
[02:37:16.274 --> 02:37:17.355]  That's a big understanding.
[02:37:18.035 --> 02:37:19.216]  How to pick a fight with these people.
[02:37:19.236 --> 02:37:19.936]  You know, I've done it.
[02:37:20.957 --> 02:37:21.737]  I did it all.
[02:37:22.537 --> 02:37:24.158]  And I'm proud of it, quite frankly.
[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:29.521]  But you know, it scares the hell out of me that I can
[02:37:31.573 --> 02:37:33.233]  Not manipulate my own wife or children.
[02:37:33.473 --> 02:37:34.154]  I have no power.
[02:37:34.354 --> 02:37:34.974]  I wouldn't even try.
[02:37:34.994 --> 02:37:41.235]  But these globalists, I've been given the power to do it, and I just lead them around by the nose.
[02:37:42.356 --> 02:37:44.836]  And it's a very scary final equation.
[02:37:45.757 --> 02:37:52.718]  That these people are running things, and they can be manipulated into a fight at the time and place of your choosing.
[02:37:53.518 --> 02:37:55.479]  The difference is though, you gotta be ready.
[02:37:58.427 --> 02:37:59.408]  You got to be ready for that fight.
[02:37:59.848 --> 02:38:01.429]  So we're going to go to these loaded phone lines.
[02:38:01.449 --> 02:38:03.510]  A lot of cool names here.
[02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:12.255]  We've got things like Mega Titan, and Ken, and Howard, and Jim, and Carlos, and John, and Tucker Vette, and Alex, and Terry, and Derek.
[02:38:12.695 --> 02:38:13.775]  Who's up first here?
[02:38:13.855 --> 02:38:15.036]  Who should we go to first?
[02:38:17.758 --> 02:38:18.778]  Let's go to the very top.
[02:38:18.938 --> 02:38:19.679]  Alex in Michigan.
[02:38:19.699 --> 02:38:20.679]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:38:20.719 --> 02:38:21.019]  Welcome.
[02:38:22.100 --> 02:38:22.660]  Alex Jones.
[02:38:22.680 --> 02:38:23.501]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:38:24.581 --> 02:38:25.302]  Thanks for calling, brother.
[02:38:25.342 --> 02:38:25.602]  Go ahead.
[02:38:27.608 --> 02:38:37.385]  Yep, just good job exposing George Bush and I just want to mention he has some ties to the opium trade as well as he's married to Aleister Crowley's daughter.
[02:38:38.147 --> 02:38:38.608]  What's her name?
[02:38:39.338 --> 02:38:40.459]  Well, people say that.
[02:38:40.499 --> 02:38:48.505]  I haven't seen the proof of that, but he definitely had ties to the Skull & Bones, which was founded by Opium Trade, and the narcotics trafficking.
[02:38:48.525 --> 02:38:50.867]  It wasn't Reagan bringing cocaine in, it was him during the 80s.
[02:38:50.927 --> 02:38:56.091]  And yeah, no, it was like Bush would do everything and then leak it to the press and blame Reagan.
[02:38:56.191 --> 02:38:57.773]  And I'm not just defending Reagan.
[02:38:58.233 --> 02:38:59.894]  Out of the folks that were there, it was going on.
[02:39:01.035 --> 02:39:04.278]  Oh yeah, and also David Knight does a good job explaining kind of
[02:39:05.598 --> 02:39:15.168]  I'm a big fan of Lord of the Rings, and Dave and I did some good analogies with how you can make metaphor out of all day, but I'll just... Oh yeah, I mean J.R.R.
[02:39:15.228 --> 02:39:16.269]  Tolkien was a genius.
[02:39:16.770 --> 02:39:21.655]  He'd been in World War I, lived in England, South Africa, Europe, and that was an allegory of good and evil.
[02:39:21.755 --> 02:39:22.556]  It was very powerful.
[02:39:23.450 --> 02:39:32.019]  Yeah, like Sauron corrupted the waters of the Greenwood first, that turned it into Mirkwood, that corrupted all the creatures, and all the spiders came out.
[02:39:32.519 --> 02:39:39.627]  And just, if you look at the GMOs, the vaccines, the fluoride... Oh, the Golden Child, all of it, they poison you first to get control of you.
[02:39:40.649 --> 02:39:53.939]  Yep, the phytoestrogens from soybeans, the barium, aluminum, sulfates, and chemtrails, the open-air pharmacological crops from companies like Protegen, the 5G, the Wi-Fi, the aborted field tissues used in flavoring companies like Sinomix.
[02:39:54.780 --> 02:39:56.361]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[02:39:56.401 --> 02:39:59.304]  The globalists admit they're corrupting us to control us.
[02:40:00.805 --> 02:40:05.829]  You read the eco-science written by the former White House science czar of Obama.
[02:40:05.889 --> 02:40:06.989]  He said all this in 1974.
[02:40:09.815 --> 02:40:15.157]  Forty-five years ago, the year I was born, I mean, these people are nasty.
[02:40:15.177 --> 02:40:19.139]  But you see, they see future war against everybody.
[02:40:19.559 --> 02:40:21.200]  They see us as their threat.
[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:23.481]  And they see the survival of the fittest.
[02:40:23.541 --> 02:40:29.283]  If they can do something evil to us and dominate us, it's their right under their social Darwinistic view.
[02:40:29.343 --> 02:40:29.923]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:40:30.344 --> 02:40:31.304]  Really great points today.
[02:40:33.660 --> 02:40:35.641]  Let's talk to Terry in Arizona.
[02:40:35.681 --> 02:40:39.102]  Let's talk about Infowars Endgame and the battle for the Republic.
[02:40:39.142 --> 02:40:39.763]  Go ahead, Terry.
[02:40:39.783 --> 02:40:40.283]  You're on the air.
[02:40:41.884 --> 02:40:42.764]  Yes, Alex.
[02:40:42.964 --> 02:40:43.964]  First, bless.
[02:40:44.225 --> 02:40:47.706]  God bless you and everybody you're working with.
[02:40:47.986 --> 02:40:48.867]  All your guests.
[02:40:48.947 --> 02:40:51.488]  I don't care if they're packing boxes for you.
[02:40:51.608 --> 02:41:03.173]  But to my point, I watched Endgame yesterday, which since I've been watching documentaries since the mid-fifties, that's the most brilliant
[02:41:03.837 --> 02:41:06.458]  Spot on documentary I've ever seen.
[02:41:06.498 --> 02:41:11.099]  When I saw that years ago when it came out, I've been with you ever since.
[02:41:11.360 --> 02:41:12.100]  And a lot of us.
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:15.301]  But you need to bring that back up.
[02:41:15.481 --> 02:41:17.021]  It was ahead of its time.
[02:41:17.542 --> 02:41:19.062]  Give promotionals.
[02:41:19.422 --> 02:41:21.203]  Everybody needs to see that.
[02:41:21.343 --> 02:41:23.904]  But I watched the extra on that.
[02:41:24.004 --> 02:41:27.505]  Besides Jimmy Vaughn's cool song you ought to be playing.
[02:41:28.482 --> 02:41:36.244]  And Battle for the Republic is about as spot on to what's going on on the border right now.
[02:41:36.784 --> 02:41:39.705]  This country needs to be watching that.
[02:41:40.085 --> 02:41:45.867]  And personally, I have to listen to you on shortwave because that's the only way I get it.
[02:41:46.467 --> 02:41:51.508]  But anyway, you need to bring... Sir, I totally agree.
[02:41:52.188 --> 02:41:52.648]  Here's the deal.
[02:41:52.768 --> 02:41:54.309]  I've made a film in six, seven, eight years.
[02:41:55.236 --> 02:41:58.081]  They're trying to block us everywhere from doing it, but we are going to make films.
[02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:03.211]  And we're going to do it again, and we're going to put them out for free like we've always done.
[02:42:03.231 --> 02:42:09.012]  Endgame had, let's not exaggerate, like 67 million views on Google Video.
[02:42:09.032 --> 02:42:11.533]  Then they just got rid of it and deleted it, and then Google Video went away.
[02:42:11.553 --> 02:42:15.654]  And it's got like, you know, total I think on YouTube like 10 million views or something.
[02:42:16.074 --> 02:42:17.115]  5 million here, a few million there.
[02:42:17.515 --> 02:42:20.415]  But yeah, the film was made 11 years ago.
[02:42:20.556 --> 02:42:22.736]  Everything in it's come true because it's what they said they'd do.
[02:42:23.116 --> 02:42:24.196]  Which is even more frightening.
[02:42:24.256 --> 02:42:25.617]  These people mean business.
[02:42:26.397 --> 02:42:32.681]  And so it gets into the whole eugenics, the funding of Hitler, the master plan, the transhumanism.
[02:42:32.981 --> 02:42:33.842]  It's a free film.
[02:42:33.862 --> 02:42:38.485]  I don't even want to talk about it because actually George Soros has been lobbying through many a matters.
[02:42:39.414 --> 02:42:44.776]  To have it removed off of YouTube and off Amazon where you can rent it for like 20 cents or something.
[02:42:44.816 --> 02:42:46.237]  But yeah, God bless you.
[02:42:46.317 --> 02:42:50.879]  Yeah, it's a very important film and that's why... God's really blessed us.
[02:42:50.959 --> 02:42:52.920]  We've done multi-lifetimes of work.
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:59.703]  That's why I want to keep fighting, but if something happens to them fours, I can already feel like we've already fulfilled our purpose.
[02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:09.349]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:43:11.055 --> 02:43:12.495]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:43:12.735 --> 02:43:17.676]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[02:43:18.837 --> 02:43:24.758]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:43:25.538 --> 02:43:33.180]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[02:43:33.960 --> 02:44:00.129]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[02:44:01.371 --> 02:44:07.694]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[02:44:08.134 --> 02:44:09.895]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[02:44:09.955 --> 02:44:14.898]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[02:44:15.338 --> 02:44:15.838]  It's big.
[02:44:16.399 --> 02:44:16.799]  It's bad.
[02:44:17.239 --> 02:44:22.462]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[02:44:22.482 --> 02:44:24.783]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[02:44:25.223 --> 02:44:28.425]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[02:44:29.025 --> 02:44:29.988]  Storewide free shipping.

[02:44:35.287 --> 02:44:36.227]  The Double Patriot points.
[02:44:36.247 --> 02:44:37.148]  That's what happened in about a week.

[02:45:35.816 --> 02:45:36.416]  But guess what?

[02:45:47.902 --> 02:45:49.503]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:45:49.903 --> 02:45:51.604]  Support the InfoWars.

[02:46:01.989 --> 02:46:07.714]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[02:46:08.014 --> 02:46:12.038]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[02:46:12.478 --> 02:46:14.680]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:16.842]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[02:46:17.182 --> 02:46:19.184]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[02:46:19.704 --> 02:46:19.965]  Boom!
[02:46:20.245 --> 02:46:22.487]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[02:46:22.847 --> 02:46:24.408]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[02:46:24.468 --> 02:46:26.290]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[02:46:26.330 --> 02:46:27.471]  You still have a shopfront.
[02:46:27.651 --> 02:46:28.472]  And then what do we see?
[02:46:28.732 --> 02:46:29.473]  Washington Post.
[02:46:30.033 --> 02:46:33.155]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[02:46:34.515 --> 02:46:37.637]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[02:46:37.657 --> 02:46:40.498]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[02:46:40.798 --> 02:46:46.221]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the product at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:46:46.521 --> 02:46:53.524]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros, like Media Matters is, to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[02:46:53.844 --> 02:46:57.226]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships, like CNN is,
[02:46:57.506 --> 02:47:01.748]  We're only funded by you, by getting the products at infootballstore.com.
[02:47:06.671 --> 02:47:11.253]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.278 --> 02:47:20.859]  I got a woman at home.
[02:47:29.890 --> 02:47:35.434]  I get hell-bent whiskey bound.
[02:47:55.621 --> 02:47:57.363]  Like, uh, dyslexically.
[02:47:57.383 --> 02:47:58.744]  Put those backwards.
[02:47:59.785 --> 02:48:00.725]  Hank Williams Jr.
[02:48:04.368 --> 02:48:08.252]  I want to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to go as far as I have to, and then Owen Benjamin can hold.
[02:48:08.312 --> 02:48:08.872]  He's a great guy.
[02:48:08.892 --> 02:48:10.073]  He'll be alright until I get to your calls.
[02:48:10.854 --> 02:48:15.598]  But, uh, you know, we just are an instant gratification society.
[02:48:16.478 --> 02:48:22.984]  And there's a lot of bad happening, but I just want to point out, every election for six years, except two,
[02:48:25.208 --> 02:48:26.448]  Has gone against the globalists.
[02:48:26.608 --> 02:48:30.549]  Venezuela and the USA because of fraud.
[02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:36.510]  And then I've got all the other reports.
[02:48:41.691 --> 02:48:42.231]  They're in trouble.
[02:48:42.331 --> 02:48:43.551]  That's why they're fighting so hard.
[02:48:43.591 --> 02:48:44.851]  So don't get too down.
[02:48:44.871 --> 02:48:51.492]  You know, you think the public would be into self-preservation and free market and seeing that Trump's going to bat for them.
[02:48:52.493 --> 02:48:54.493]  Again, people say, oh, you need to quit supporting Trump.
[02:48:55.819 --> 02:48:57.680]  I've been persecuted because I support Trump.
[02:48:58.481 --> 02:49:00.563]  And I support him more because I've been persecuted.
[02:49:01.283 --> 02:49:01.844]  Not less.
[02:49:02.724 --> 02:49:06.067]  And I have grown men and lawyers and everybody else go, you know, Robert Mueller.
[02:49:08.589 --> 02:49:09.950]  And I mean folks that work with Mueller.
[02:49:10.470 --> 02:49:11.391]  I shouldn't get into this.
[02:49:11.531 --> 02:49:12.552]  I'm not really supposed to.
[02:49:12.572 --> 02:49:20.898]  Because unless something's criminal and things are, you know, on record, I don't talk about them.
[02:49:20.938 --> 02:49:23.000]  But, you know, I've told
[02:49:24.144 --> 02:49:30.051]  The president about this, and I've told high-level national talk shows about it, and I've got all the documents out there, because it happened twice.
[02:49:30.752 --> 02:49:33.976]  I had Robert Mueller literally try to set me up.
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:38.382]  And I called the FBI, and I sent them a letter, too.
[02:49:38.442 --> 02:49:39.223]  I said, I'm ready to come in.
[02:49:39.263 --> 02:49:40.184]  I'm ready to talk about this right now.
[02:49:40.404 --> 02:49:41.526]  Of course, they didn't.
[02:49:41.866 --> 02:49:42.928]  They sent the people that did it.
[02:49:44.329 --> 02:49:45.830]  That doesn't mean the whole FBI is bad.
[02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:47.711]  And it's not like some ass-kissing thing about the FBI.
[02:49:47.832 --> 02:49:49.573]  It's like saying, Walmart!
[02:49:49.613 --> 02:49:53.696]  You know, one guy was a jerk to me, so all of Walmart is bad.
[02:49:54.196 --> 02:49:54.897]  I want to be clear.
[02:49:55.657 --> 02:49:57.879]  Some of the best people I've ever met in my life were FBI agents.
[02:49:57.899 --> 02:50:00.080]  I mean, I grew up around some of them.
[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:00.841]  Family, friends, people.
[02:50:01.361 --> 02:50:04.484]  Steadfast Christians, super hardworking, doing great things.
[02:50:05.064 --> 02:50:08.406]  Working 24 hours a day sometimes to get kidnapped kids or bank robbers.
[02:50:08.807 --> 02:50:12.429]  And then you got big old evil turds like Robert Mueller right on top of it.
[02:50:12.449 --> 02:50:13.090]  And I just, you know.
[02:50:13.630 --> 02:50:16.251]  I'm just not going to put up with it or that idiot, Comey.
[02:50:16.291 --> 02:50:18.911]  If I get him off the screen, I can't look at him.
[02:50:20.431 --> 02:50:24.372]  So when I say nice things about the FBI, it's not because I don't hate the corruption in it.
[02:50:25.292 --> 02:50:27.253]  It's because I'm not going to lie and say the whole thing's bad.
[02:50:27.333 --> 02:50:29.973]  But let me tell you something.
[02:50:29.993 --> 02:50:30.794]  It's real personal.
[02:50:32.214 --> 02:50:36.155]  When all you care about is the country and you're a good moral person who's never screwed anybody over.
[02:50:36.435 --> 02:50:37.155]  Let me tell you something.
[02:50:38.720 --> 02:50:45.261]  I would have made, let's not exaggerate, you know how much money, I'm going to go to the calls, but I just, I've been meaning to say this and I'm going to say, you know what?
[02:50:45.862 --> 02:50:47.542]  I'll just, maybe I'll say it tomorrow.
[02:50:48.602 --> 02:50:50.082]  It's not like I'm hiding what I'm about to say.
[02:50:50.142 --> 02:50:53.203]  It's just, it's like such an example of what I stand for.
[02:51:00.104 --> 02:51:04.465]  I could have made $500 million.
[02:51:05.086 --> 02:51:07.006]  I went back and looked at the offers and these were real groups.
[02:51:08.302 --> 02:51:23.747]  But see, I'm not Floyd Waymother, and I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but I could have sat up here and pitched you Ponzi schemes with different Bitcoins and been paid millions per month, per group for years on the way up.
[02:51:23.787 --> 02:51:24.607]  They tried to hire me.
[02:51:25.667 --> 02:51:29.889]  I got visited and told how great George Soros was and how I should leave him alone.
[02:51:30.069 --> 02:51:32.810]  And here's $20 million of Bitcoin.
[02:51:33.870 --> 02:51:36.011]  I didn't even ever get it off the laptop.
[02:51:36.051 --> 02:51:36.751]  I don't know where it is.
[02:51:44.884 --> 02:51:52.489]  And then I sat there, and I had them offer me last year, you know, even more money.
[02:51:52.689 --> 02:51:54.150]  And it's big groups in the news.
[02:51:57.892 --> 02:51:59.653]  And they even told me, oh, here's how you do it.
[02:51:59.693 --> 02:52:02.495]  You tell them you're being paid, but you just kind of slip it in there.
[02:52:02.515 --> 02:52:05.677]  That way you don't, you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't go after you.
[02:52:06.517 --> 02:52:08.739]  And I was like, no, I'm not doing that.
[02:52:10.270 --> 02:52:17.516]  Because I said, I believe cryptocurrency should be a real technology, but this whole thing of pumping it up and dumping it, let me just quantify this for you.
[02:52:17.817 --> 02:52:19.778]  Soros is behind Bitcoin, okay?
[02:52:21.540 --> 02:52:24.883]  And they even sent their god-dogged agents in here.
[02:52:26.144 --> 02:52:27.245]  And they think I'm stupid.
[02:52:29.086 --> 02:52:30.868]  And they can't believe I didn't take the money.
[02:52:32.529 --> 02:52:37.894]  Soros, if I was 14 and they offered me money to round up my fellow people or anybody else,
[02:52:40.262 --> 02:52:41.043]  I'd tell them yes.
[02:52:42.504 --> 02:52:44.826]  And then I'd get a submachine gun and I'd go after everybody.
[02:52:45.607 --> 02:52:46.507]  See, because I'm a Texan.
[02:52:48.349 --> 02:52:49.430]  I'm mentally ill, you see.
[02:52:49.850 --> 02:52:50.831]  I care about people.
[02:52:52.653 --> 02:52:53.493]  But I'm also a killer.
[02:52:54.074 --> 02:52:55.916]  See, you guys can't get the two together.
[02:52:56.976 --> 02:53:00.139]  It's like Conrad Lorenz and animal psychology.
[02:53:00.179 --> 02:53:03.582]  The most vicious animals are actually the most loving because they have a governor.
[02:53:03.782 --> 02:53:05.144]  You people are weak.
[02:53:05.544 --> 02:53:07.425]  You don't have a governor, you see.
[02:53:08.473 --> 02:53:11.556]  So, I didn't want the 500 million dollars.
[02:53:13.978 --> 02:53:19.542]  So what, I'd have some private jet and a bunch of people hate me and I hang around a bunch of mummies like you?
[02:53:22.285 --> 02:53:27.789]  And that's what makes me sick about so-called little friends I knew that won't even talk to me now because I've been blackballed.
[02:53:28.823 --> 02:53:31.144]  They don't even get that they sold out their whole birthright.
[02:53:32.024 --> 02:53:32.384]  Everything.
[02:53:34.004 --> 02:53:35.005]  And they didn't even know.
[02:53:35.065 --> 02:53:36.545]  So my own crew's great.
[02:53:36.585 --> 02:53:37.785]  People are like, oh, this is great.
[02:53:37.826 --> 02:53:39.306]  We have these advertising things.
[02:53:39.326 --> 02:53:49.949]  I even had to tell GCN a few years ago, I said, if you run those Bitcoin ads, I'm going to leave your network.
[02:53:50.677 --> 02:53:51.918]  They're like, well, that's very threatening.
[02:53:52.638 --> 02:53:54.179]  And I said, it ain't threatening, man.
[02:53:55.099 --> 02:53:58.141]  If I'm going to sell out, I'm going to go all the way.
[02:53:58.421 --> 02:54:02.443]  I'm not going to, like, not sell out to the globalists and then sit here and F my audience over.
[02:54:03.724 --> 02:54:04.504]  It's not happening.
[02:54:04.524 --> 02:54:07.185]  Because my audience is me!
[02:54:08.826 --> 02:54:11.327]  If my audience treated me like that, I'd want to kill them!
[02:54:12.668 --> 02:54:14.169]  You people don't get that, do you?
[02:54:14.209 --> 02:54:17.450]  You don't have an understanding of treating people like you want to be treated.
[02:54:17.711 --> 02:54:19.451]  You don't have any Christlike qualities.
[02:54:19.612 --> 02:54:20.252]  You have zero!
[02:54:22.401 --> 02:54:24.662]  And you think it's so tough to screw people over.
[02:54:24.722 --> 02:54:25.842]  You think it's so cool.
[02:54:25.902 --> 02:54:27.223]  But, you know, I look at the globalists.
[02:54:32.805 --> 02:54:37.427]  And they, almost all of them, give their sons over to the pedophile rings.
[02:54:39.788 --> 02:54:45.010]  As, I mean, you could even be one of the most powerful Robert Barron families in the country, and your son's now a CNN host.
[02:54:45.531 --> 02:54:48.752]  And at nine years old, they gave their son to the cult.
[02:54:50.316 --> 02:54:52.458]  So 50 guys could gang bang him.
[02:54:53.419 --> 02:54:55.000]  I'm not gonna say the name of the guy, but it's well known.
[02:54:56.041 --> 02:54:57.242]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[02:54:57.322 --> 02:55:00.365]  It's like, do you think I want to be with you forever?
[02:55:00.685 --> 02:55:01.886]  I do not want to be near you.
[02:55:02.547 --> 02:55:03.488]  This is a spiritual thing.
[02:55:03.548 --> 02:55:05.490]  Like, I don't want to be close to you.
[02:55:05.570 --> 02:55:06.110]  You understand that?
[02:55:07.071 --> 02:55:09.233]  So taking your money is getting close to you.
[02:55:09.273 --> 02:55:11.535]  It's like, it's not hard to deny your money.
[02:55:12.736 --> 02:55:13.357]  It's the opposite.
[02:55:14.178 --> 02:55:16.680]  It's a pleasure.
[02:55:18.743 --> 02:55:23.708]  It's a pleasure because this is a spiritual thing.
[02:55:24.609 --> 02:55:26.931]  I ain't screwing no kids and I ain't into kids.
[02:55:28.032 --> 02:55:28.552]  You got that?
[02:55:30.034 --> 02:55:32.836]  And I'm not into your devil worship or all the rest of it.
[02:55:32.956 --> 02:55:41.945]  And so I just wanted to metaphysically get that out here just as an example that I, in nine years of Bitcoin being promoted and all the rest of it,
[02:55:43.246 --> 02:55:51.291]  Never promoted it and never took it as advertising and never did, even though I had to sit here and hear it on local stations and hear it promoted in my name.
[02:55:52.651 --> 02:55:57.634]  Lord knows, I try to be good, but I can't control everybody around me.
[02:56:00.156 --> 02:56:03.958]  And I told people, I said, I
[02:56:06.377 --> 02:56:13.820]  Cannot understand this, and I see it as a scam, and there's promoters and speculators creating bubbles and Ponzi schemes, and I will not be involved.
[02:56:13.840 --> 02:56:19.101]  Even though I could tell my audience, hey, get involved in this, it's a bubble, I'll tell you when to get out.
[02:56:19.862 --> 02:56:21.182]  Well, why not Rob Banks?
[02:56:21.242 --> 02:56:22.683]  Why not be Robert Mueller then?
[02:56:23.263 --> 02:56:26.144]  And, you know, let Jeffrey Epstein run child kidnapping rings for you.
[02:56:26.364 --> 02:56:29.925]  You know, if you're gonna go bad, why not go all the way?
[02:56:33.586 --> 02:56:35.747]  Let's see, I've chosen a different path.
[02:56:39.093 --> 02:56:40.474]  And I think they've already figured it out.
[02:56:40.614 --> 02:56:42.115]  And it's not just me, it's all of you.
[02:56:42.795 --> 02:56:43.636]  You see what we are?
[02:56:45.177 --> 02:56:47.078]  It's the lethal injection to the New World Order.
[02:56:51.181 --> 02:56:53.182]  And they've just now figured it out, you see.
[02:56:55.064 --> 02:56:57.986]  I didn't say that to act powerful, because I don't love death, I don't like death.
[02:56:58.646 --> 02:57:04.090]  But I had to recognize it, that InfoWars is the angel of death.
[02:57:04.990 --> 02:57:05.911]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:57:06.886 --> 02:57:13.429]  You know, they call us the most dangerous people in the world, and we're going to destroy the world, and all these publications, and I must be... And it's the truth!
[02:57:14.589 --> 02:57:17.830]  Because to death, life coming back to the world, is death!
[02:57:19.151 --> 02:57:21.852]  And so, I am the Grim Reaper.
[02:57:21.952 --> 02:57:24.033]  So are you, to these people.
[02:57:26.234 --> 02:57:35.558]  And, I'm not knocking anybody that was involved in all the Bitcoin permutations, but I wouldn't promote it to you, because my spirit told me it was
[02:57:36.567 --> 02:57:37.028]  A scam.
[02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:40.854]  To discredit other cryptocurrencies coming in the future.
[02:57:41.195 --> 02:57:42.377]  Doesn't mean all of it's bad.
[02:57:43.459 --> 02:57:45.462]  But it still means that it's a fraud.
[02:57:47.385 --> 02:57:48.307]  We'll be back with your phone call.
[02:57:48.327 --> 02:57:48.647]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.771 --> 02:58:00.816]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.

[02:59:42.100 --> 02:59:43.841]  2018 has been an incredible year.
[02:59:44.281 --> 02:59:49.023]  As we prepare to close it out, I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWar possible.
[02:59:49.383 --> 02:59:51.324]  Again, you are the resistance.
[02:59:55.505 --> 03:00:00.127]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.541 --> 03:00:08.282]  Big Brother.
[03:00:08.702 --> 03:00:09.923]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:10.503 --> 03:00:11.544]  Government cover-up.
[03:00:12.385 --> 03:00:13.786]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:14.066 --> 03:00:15.287]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:15.747 --> 03:00:20.451]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.832 --> 03:00:31.679]  Owen Benjamin, one of the top comedians in the country, put into the Phantom Zones, joining us in 15 minutes, because I'm in a bad void.
[03:00:33.158 --> 03:00:34.660]  I'm stealing 50 minutes of the hour.
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:37.783]  Grace, you should have to host to go to your phone calls.
[03:00:38.143 --> 03:00:40.305]  Trucker Vet in FEMA Region 9.
[03:00:40.726 --> 03:00:42.467]  That means he's out on the West Coast.
[03:00:42.808 --> 03:00:43.308]  You're on the air.
[03:00:43.328 --> 03:00:44.149]  Thanks for holding, brother.
[03:00:44.189 --> 03:00:44.550]  Go ahead.
[03:00:45.811 --> 03:00:46.632]  Hey, Alex.
[03:00:46.732 --> 03:00:47.773]  Great to talk to you.
[03:00:48.914 --> 03:00:52.457]  You talked a couple of segments ago about engaging thinkers.
[03:00:52.778 --> 03:00:54.379]  I'd like to think of myself as a thinker.
[03:00:54.479 --> 03:00:56.882]  Maybe you can engage me in a little dialogue.
[03:00:58.004 --> 03:01:06.995]  Maybe we can come up with an idea or two that could be so revolutionary that it would be the final nails in the coffin.
[03:01:07.075 --> 03:01:11.841]  But I don't think we're anywhere close to that yet.
[03:01:12.943 --> 03:01:13.924]  Because it's so simple.
[03:01:14.847 --> 03:01:26.533]  The globalists are multinational corporations who pay no tax, are diplomatically immune, above the law, telling us to all fight with each other and get rid of our nation states to loot our public treasury.
[03:01:26.833 --> 03:01:38.299]  So if we just renounce globalism and go back to nationalism and localism and cultural icons of success and get back to competition, we will win.
[03:01:38.379 --> 03:01:39.299]  I mean, it's all right there.
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:44.482]  OK, and on the subject that you brought up,
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:46.601]  What's another thing that we could renounce?
[03:01:47.221 --> 03:01:48.602]  And that would fit everybody.
[03:01:48.662 --> 03:01:49.982]  That would fit the common person.
[03:01:50.502 --> 03:01:57.165]  Once the common person renounces this, then it's not just Alex Jones and... Renounce the smartphones?
[03:01:57.245 --> 03:01:58.286]  Renounce the GMO?
[03:01:58.306 --> 03:01:59.206]  Tell me what to renounce.
[03:01:59.507 --> 03:01:59.867]  I'm ready.
[03:02:01.227 --> 03:02:01.908]  Uh, here we go.
[03:02:02.428 --> 03:02:03.468]  Not necessarily for you.
[03:02:03.508 --> 03:02:04.449]  You're on the front lines.
[03:02:04.489 --> 03:02:08.330]  But for everybody else that's had enough and that wants to say, you know what?
[03:02:08.531 --> 03:02:09.431]  I'm in this fight too.
[03:02:10.331 --> 03:02:13.853]  And this, we would even be challenging our president to say,
[03:02:14.505 --> 03:02:24.534]  Hey, by your own principles of the book that you wrote, The Art of the Deal, you don't pay contractors that break their contract.
[03:02:24.954 --> 03:02:27.376]  You stop paying them.
[03:02:27.736 --> 03:02:33.041]  And also, something else that you brought up probably a little over a week ago.
[03:02:33.601 --> 03:02:36.304]  Yes, the social contract has been broken.
[03:02:36.804 --> 03:02:39.887]  The social contract, by the powers that be,
[03:02:40.843 --> 03:02:42.904]  They have broken their contract with us.
[03:02:43.244 --> 03:02:45.765]  Therefore, we have a right to say, you know what?
[03:02:45.905 --> 03:02:47.106]  You've broken that contract.
[03:02:47.666 --> 03:02:51.167]  I am no longer paying my federal income taxes.
[03:02:51.748 --> 03:03:03.012]  And I dare President Trump to come in and protect people that are doing that because we are acting justly.
[03:03:05.228 --> 03:03:06.791]  Why should we pay?
[03:03:07.473 --> 03:03:11.060]  Trucker Vet, you are infinity correct.
[03:03:12.006 --> 03:03:20.131]  I just can't give people advice in their own lives and then they do it wrong or however and then they get in big trouble because the mafia comes to break their legs and it's my fault.
[03:03:20.691 --> 03:03:22.693]  But yes, the social contract has been broken.
[03:03:22.713 --> 03:03:23.833]  Trump's trying to fix it.
[03:03:24.554 --> 03:03:30.037]  He's trying to set up a level playing field, bring back prosperity so we're not forced into welfare and bondage.
[03:03:30.937 --> 03:03:34.099]  And you're absolutely right that the system is out of control.
[03:03:34.139 --> 03:03:36.701]  The illegal aliens don't follow the social contract.
[03:03:36.721 --> 03:03:37.962]  The Democrats don't follow it.
[03:03:38.482 --> 03:03:39.703]  The EU doesn't follow it.
[03:03:39.723 --> 03:03:40.824]  They're all tax-exempt.
[03:03:40.884 --> 03:03:42.625]  In fact, I said that before you even brought up your point.
[03:03:42.885 --> 03:03:44.246]  Because it's all the truth of this.
[03:03:45.827 --> 03:03:48.249]  So we're trying to get the social contract back.
[03:03:49.010 --> 03:03:52.732]  Because the third world has a broken social contract and everybody knows it.
[03:03:53.093 --> 03:03:55.154]  Civilization is about a social contract.
[03:03:55.534 --> 03:03:59.137]  Limited government around main ideas that promote human empowerment.
[03:04:00.678 --> 03:04:01.559]  Right, okay, right.
[03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:19.666]  Therefore, the common person, if you want to get in this game, one way to do it is to stop paying your federal income taxes, and at the same time, we're kind of making it a little more dangerous for Trump, but say, hey, everybody that does this, you need to pardon them across the board.
[03:04:19.706 --> 03:04:25.491]  No, no, here's the problem, and then they have a white supremacist who works for the Southern Property Law Center that does it and embarrasses Trump.
[03:04:25.931 --> 03:04:26.512]  Here's the issue.
[03:04:28.396 --> 03:04:30.678]  We have to say it's broken ourselves.
[03:04:30.778 --> 03:04:31.979]  Trump can't do it all.
[03:04:32.720 --> 03:04:33.801]  And we have to stand up.
[03:04:34.001 --> 03:04:35.723]  But you made an incredibly good point here.
[03:04:36.323 --> 03:04:39.887]  And we have to realize that that's where this has gone and reach out to other people.
[03:04:39.927 --> 03:04:40.587]  But here's the problem.
[03:04:41.028 --> 03:04:44.211]  The globalists control the actuaries and the fiat currency of the banks.
[03:04:44.771 --> 03:04:46.232]  They don't even need the tax money, bro.
[03:04:46.653 --> 03:04:48.615]  That's all to siphon off the economy.
[03:04:48.655 --> 03:04:50.797]  They raise taxes to kill recoveries.
[03:04:52.421 --> 03:04:58.009]  At the point of, I don't blame people that don't pay taxes if things are a fraud, as long as they're not pulling welfare.
[03:04:58.369 --> 03:04:59.251]  Do whatever you have to do.
[03:05:05.490 --> 03:05:07.491]  Introducing Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:05:07.511 --> 03:05:12.334]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas we've ever offered with even better ingredients.
[03:05:12.474 --> 03:05:16.097]  Ultimate Bone Broth to help you save big on this new product and stock up.
[03:05:16.137 --> 03:05:18.618]  We're dropping the price to $19.95.
[03:05:18.858 --> 03:05:22.641]  Our previous supplier was unable to get the incredible ingredients.
[03:05:23.101 --> 03:05:23.741]  We're good to go.
[03:05:38.266 --> 03:05:43.150]  Chicago mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, and alfalfa herb powder.
[03:05:43.310 --> 03:05:44.410]  And even more, of course.
[03:05:44.551 --> 03:05:54.077]  These powerful ingredients are going to help you get the most out of your workout by supporting your healthy muscles, digestion, tendons, and ligaments, while also supporting your body's fight against free radicals.
[03:05:54.357 --> 03:06:01.362]  It's time to take advantage and pick up your bottle of an updated favorite formula with ultimate bone broth from InfoWars Life.
[03:06:01.462 --> 03:06:01.863]  Thank you!
[03:06:12.694 --> 03:06:15.583]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[03:06:31.069 --> 03:06:34.993]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:35.693 --> 03:06:41.620]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:42.220 --> 03:06:49.107]  Owen Benjamin, one of the top comedians in the country, a really smart guy, but beyond comedian, he knows how to decipher propaganda and brainwashing.
[03:06:49.127 --> 03:06:50.108]  He's coming up in ten minutes.
[03:06:50.969 --> 03:06:53.292]  Right now, I held over because I promised I'd go to your calls.
[03:06:53.332 --> 03:06:54.873]  Let's rampage through them.
[03:06:54.913 --> 03:06:56.435]  I can't give each caller five minutes now.
[03:06:56.975 --> 03:06:58.257]  I gotta give each caller like a minute and a half.
[03:06:58.777 --> 03:07:05.604]  We're gonna go to Derek, Jerome, John, Megha, Ken, Howard, Jim, Carlos, John, everybody right now.
[03:07:05.904 --> 03:07:07.566]  Let's go to Carlos in Canada.
[03:07:07.606 --> 03:07:11.290]  Carlos in Canada, thanks for joining InfoWars and NewsWars.com.
[03:07:12.233 --> 03:07:13.234]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[03:07:14.014 --> 03:07:21.098]  What I have to tell you today will probably change the way you'll ever see the film again of the Kennedy assassination, that famous shot.
[03:07:21.478 --> 03:07:24.840]  That was taken by a man by the name of Abraham Zapruder.
[03:07:25.541 --> 03:07:33.485]  Abraham Zapruder's partner in the dressmaking business, the designer, was Madame Lagonde, who was French intelligence, more likely.
[03:07:34.086 --> 03:07:41.190]  No, I already know about the French intelligence shooter, the jackal, all of it, I believe me.
[03:07:42.165 --> 03:07:48.807]  Yes, well, her husband was George de Morenschild, also a question of intelligence.
[03:07:49.067 --> 03:07:49.727]  White Russian.
[03:07:49.807 --> 03:07:59.569]  In the oil business, who arranged for Oswald to be introduced to the community in Dallas, and who arranged for the job for him to have.
[03:07:59.589 --> 03:08:01.730]  Believe me, I know all about the community in Dallas.
[03:08:01.850 --> 03:08:02.330]  I grew up there.
[03:08:03.530 --> 03:08:07.551]  And Oswald got the job at the repository there.
[03:08:08.691 --> 03:08:10.952]  Mr. de Morenschild
[03:08:11.394 --> 03:08:16.638]  And when he was called to testify the second time around in the late 60s, he contacted George Herbert Walker Bush for help.
[03:08:16.778 --> 03:08:17.558]  He subsequently shot himself.
[03:08:17.598 --> 03:08:17.939]  He killed himself.
[03:08:17.959 --> 03:08:18.539]  Of course he did.
[03:08:18.559 --> 03:08:21.441]  Yeah, but then they had the church hearings later in the 70s and it all came out.
[03:08:39.201 --> 03:08:42.952]  Let me tell you something, I'm not going to get into the details, but my grandmother, my mom's mom...
[03:08:44.281 --> 03:08:47.303]  Dated LBJ's main hitman before she married my grandfather.
[03:08:47.843 --> 03:08:50.725]  She was such a dashing Army Air Corpsman that played for UT football.
[03:08:50.745 --> 03:08:54.988]  The rest of it stole her away, but... And she dated... Well, I'm not going to get into it before that.
[03:08:55.448 --> 03:08:57.990]  The point is, it was all a big joke in Austin and Dallas.
[03:08:58.210 --> 03:08:58.850]  She was in Dallas.
[03:08:58.890 --> 03:08:59.410]  We moved down here.
[03:08:59.430 --> 03:09:00.891]  About how they killed Kennedy.
[03:09:00.911 --> 03:09:03.913]  I mean, it was not a... It was like, we killed that son of a bitch!
[03:09:03.973 --> 03:09:04.314]  Yeah.
[03:09:04.594 --> 03:09:07.656]  I mean, it wasn't even... I mean, around here, everybody just brags about it.
[03:09:07.716 --> 03:09:09.056]  I mean, we all knew who the shooters are.
[03:09:09.096 --> 03:09:09.737]  Everything around here.
[03:09:12.233 --> 03:09:21.315]  Because when I watched the video, the movie, and I noticed that the movie was so steady, the handheld steady shot, I always suspected something.
[03:09:21.755 --> 03:09:28.677]  I then subsequently followed up because, you know, French agents were here in Quebec, in Canada, trying to get Quebec to separate.
[03:09:29.177 --> 03:09:36.159]  And it turns out that Madame Le Gon arranged for the video of Zapruder, which no one else had seen, for Charles de Gaulle to see.
[03:09:36.719 --> 03:09:37.599]  And he watched it.
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:39.640]  On the day that Kennedy was shot,
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:43.767]  That day was his birthday, De Gaulle's birthday.
[03:09:43.868 --> 03:09:50.761]  A little bit of a message for De Gaulle who kicked out the German EU plan and seized nuclear weapons in a silent coup.
[03:09:50.781 --> 03:09:51.563]  It was a threat to De Gaulle.
[03:09:52.423 --> 03:10:01.447]  Correct, and it was Charles De Gaulle that had told earlier before the assassination to President Nixon that he had a very good chance of becoming President of the United States.
[03:10:02.267 --> 03:10:10.530]  There's so much more, of course, you can get in, but I want to just remind you that it's heartbreaking because we in Canada love President Kennedy as well.
[03:10:10.550 --> 03:10:20.514]  We were kids, I was 12 years old, and only subsequently when visiting his grave with my parents, a couple of years later, the grave was just on the ground with a torch lit
[03:10:21.011 --> 03:10:22.665]  We were there, my parents and my brother.
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:30.842]  Speaking Spanish and very sad when a couple walked behind us and approached us and very quietly we looked over and here was Captain Ahab.
[03:10:31.522 --> 03:10:49.485]  It was the actor Gregory Peck and his wife and we were all quiet there at the grave and it meant so much to us because of Kennedy and of course this famous actor and his wife said oh you speak Spanish and we just couldn't say much yes other than it was so sad we walked away.
[03:10:49.766 --> 03:10:51.646]  You know President Kennedy was
[03:10:52.585 --> 03:10:58.507]  A person who had every opportunity to do his job as president, and only cowards rely on assassination.
[03:10:58.568 --> 03:10:59.048]  No, you're right.
[03:10:59.068 --> 03:11:01.509]  I wasn't finishing your story to make it sound smart.
[03:11:01.549 --> 03:11:03.069]  I wanted people to know it's not made up.
[03:11:03.089 --> 03:11:04.350]  It's actually well known.
[03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:06.231]  They had French intelligence.
[03:11:06.391 --> 03:11:07.791]  They had the military there.
[03:11:08.251 --> 03:11:09.512]  They had the Italian mafias.
[03:11:09.532 --> 03:11:14.854]  They could blame any group they wanted to, but we know who was pulling the trigger, and it was E. Howard Hunt.
[03:11:14.874 --> 03:11:16.475]  He wasn't just a benchwarmer.
[03:11:16.875 --> 03:11:19.456]  He was a famous super long shot guy from
[03:11:20.476 --> 03:11:22.599]  John, in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[03:11:22.639 --> 03:11:24.200]  How's globalism all play out?
[03:11:24.220 --> 03:11:24.501]  Tell me.
[03:11:39.381 --> 03:11:40.942]  It's great to be with you.
[03:11:41.102 --> 03:11:46.506]  You know, globalism is now dead and they can't put the toothpaste back into the tube.
[03:11:46.866 --> 03:11:51.850]  You see people that are rising up and really, Donald Trump has been the big change in the whole thing.
[03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:57.914]  We have a guy that's fighting on our side and, you know, it's just absolutely amazing.
[03:11:57.954 --> 03:12:01.216]  You see the people rising up in France chanting that they want Trump.
[03:12:02.137 --> 03:12:03.878]  There is far more support out there that
[03:12:04.639 --> 03:12:07.840]  The mainstream would ever let us know, and they cover it up.
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:10.821]  Oh yeah, we totally won the election.
[03:12:10.941 --> 03:12:14.983]  All the other elections were winning, and all the evidence is they stole it.
[03:12:15.043 --> 03:12:15.403]  Oh, 100%.
[03:12:15.923 --> 03:12:16.443]  And you know what?
[03:12:16.503 --> 03:12:19.364]  We'll get those back too, and the truth will come out.
[03:12:20.384 --> 03:12:22.505]  The Department of Homeland Security is going to put out that.
[03:12:22.525 --> 03:12:25.146]  I was about to say, we'll just indict all these Democrats.
[03:12:25.166 --> 03:12:27.027]  They're the ones who started all this.
[03:12:27.067 --> 03:12:27.627]  We're going to finish it.
[03:12:28.703 --> 03:12:47.026]  And you know, just to leave you with a final thought and a message for the globalists, you know, one day every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, and they can have their power on earth, they can work on their life extension technology to prevent themselves from going to hell, but at the end of the day, you know, Jesus has the final say.
[03:12:47.566 --> 03:12:52.789]  And they're going to pay for what they've done to the people on this planet, and that's going to be the real justice.
[03:12:52.809 --> 03:12:53.409]  I agree, John.
[03:12:53.449 --> 03:12:54.009]  God bless you.
[03:12:54.429 --> 03:12:56.390]  I can tell you why the right wing in Texas was pissed.
[03:12:56.911 --> 03:13:03.034]  Kennedy did some things that made them mad, and he was going really fast on a lot of things that I agree with, like civil rights and all that.
[03:13:04.054 --> 03:13:09.357]  But then they thought the killing of Kennedy was to stop the New World Order, and it got worse, and that's why they're so pissed.
[03:13:10.917 --> 03:13:12.338]  And that's a little inside baseball.
[03:13:12.858 --> 03:13:16.040]  Because Texas is the reason the President's dead, to quote the misfits.
[03:13:17.802 --> 03:13:19.824]  Uh, let's talk to, uh, who's up next here.
[03:13:19.844 --> 03:13:22.227]  He's been holding along this, uh, someone.
[03:13:22.247 --> 03:13:22.928]  Benjamin's awesome.
[03:13:22.948 --> 03:13:23.588]  I want to cut him to him.
[03:13:23.608 --> 03:13:24.389]  I want to take your calls.
[03:13:24.930 --> 03:13:26.111]  I only said take 10 calls.
[03:13:26.131 --> 03:13:26.832]  He's like 20 here.
[03:13:27.252 --> 03:13:28.373]  Derek in Florida.
[03:13:28.394 --> 03:13:28.814]  You're on the air.
[03:13:28.854 --> 03:13:29.395]  Thanks for holding.
[03:13:31.397 --> 03:13:31.877]  Hey, Alex.
[03:13:31.897 --> 03:13:32.778]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:13:33.279 --> 03:13:33.779]  Welcome, sir.
[03:13:33.799 --> 03:13:34.100]  Go ahead.
[03:13:34.819 --> 03:13:35.379]  God bless you, man.
[03:13:36.159 --> 03:13:39.360]  I was curious what your opinion was on H.W.'
[03:13:39.340 --> 03:13:49.702]  's funeral being scheduled for Wednesday, December 5th, which is the same day that the Congressional Oversight Committee was scheduled to meet with Huber regarding his investigation into the Clinton Foundation.
[03:13:51.142 --> 03:13:55.063]  I think it's interesting, and they got the stock market closed, but we'll see what happens.
[03:13:55.163 --> 03:13:56.384]  I mean, George H.W.
[03:13:56.404 --> 03:13:57.944]  Bush was a horrible globalist.
[03:13:58.817 --> 03:14:00.558]  I don't celebrate his death or anything.
[03:14:00.678 --> 03:14:05.980]  It's just that I do see it as a kind of an archetype of how globalism is in so much trouble.
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:06.400]  What do you think?
[03:14:08.241 --> 03:14:08.841]  Yeah, I agree.
[03:14:09.702 --> 03:14:14.464]  I mean, I noticed though that they did postpone the hearing with Huber and it was a little bit disappointing.
[03:14:14.524 --> 03:14:17.465]  I've been waiting patiently for a few weeks now to see that happen.
[03:14:18.343 --> 03:14:31.108]  So I'm also kind of curious, do you think that once that hearing does take place, are they going to start releasing some of those findings into the public, or do you think they're going to continue to kind of keep this silent war behind public scrutiny?
[03:14:31.908 --> 03:14:35.709]  Oh, the deep state thought it was invincible and it's committed all these unbelievable crimes.
[03:14:35.729 --> 03:14:44.953]  That's why they're fighting so hard is to keep the National Security Act in place, keep it going forever so they can classify things out to infinity.
[03:14:46.499 --> 03:14:49.760]  Because they ever get caught, they go down.
[03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:51.000]  And that's why D.C.
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:59.982]  is just full of all these cowardly lawyers who are just in this incredible sycophantic worship fest of these globalists.
[03:15:00.022 --> 03:15:04.963]  I mean, I've been in some of these meetings off-record, not selling out, but just in meetings with people I wanted to meet.
[03:15:05.543 --> 03:15:10.204]  And this, the sycophantic way they all, like Perina,
[03:15:11.784 --> 03:15:13.466]  You know, the dog chow lady, Perina.
[03:15:14.026 --> 03:15:16.249]  Perina chow lady, like, worshipping Chaney today.
[03:15:16.769 --> 03:15:18.711]  And it's just all sick.
[03:15:18.931 --> 03:15:20.132]  It is so satanic.
[03:15:20.733 --> 03:15:21.594]  It is such a joke.
[03:15:21.654 --> 03:15:22.555]  It's not about merit.
[03:15:23.155 --> 03:15:23.596]  God bless you.
[03:15:23.616 --> 03:15:24.316]  I appreciate your call.
[03:15:25.297 --> 03:15:32.004]  Okay, John of Wyoming and Jerome and Megatitan and Ken and Jim.
[03:15:35.447 --> 03:15:36.168]  Turn this up real quick.
[03:15:40.456 --> 03:15:41.236]  Illinois balked.
[03:15:41.456 --> 03:15:42.056]  Florida balked.
[03:15:43.137 --> 03:15:43.897]  They all had hit teams.
[03:15:43.917 --> 03:15:44.577]  Couldn't pull the trigger.
[03:15:45.477 --> 03:15:46.358]  Texas pulled the trigger.
[03:15:46.398 --> 03:15:46.878]  Let me tell you.
[03:15:47.418 --> 03:15:48.498]  A Texan pulled the trigger.
[03:15:49.118 --> 03:15:50.199]  Along with a guy from Connecticut.
[03:15:50.779 --> 03:15:51.439]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:51.459 --> 03:15:51.839]  Stay with us.
[03:16:08.032 --> 03:16:10.974]  Thought in marketing and in advertising and in sales.
[03:16:11.975 --> 03:16:15.918]  Now, I've been on the radio and TV for 23 plus years.
[03:16:16.459 --> 03:16:24.305]  I never went to any professional schools, but over the years I learned a lot about those professional schools and the different perspectives.
[03:16:25.446 --> 03:16:31.051]  There's five or six different ways that people pitch things, and there's different permutations and commutations of that.
[03:16:32.631 --> 03:16:35.333]  But I just come from it with the golden rule.
[03:16:35.393 --> 03:16:36.794]  Treat others like you want to be treated.
[03:16:37.455 --> 03:16:39.436]  Do unto others as you would like to be.
[03:16:43.763 --> 03:16:49.287]  We've taken that philosophy to the next level with all the products we sell at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:16:49.968 --> 03:16:53.290]  Now, let's just look at two different systems of sales.
[03:16:53.310 --> 03:17:04.219]  The one that we fall into and then the one that targets about 25% of the population that is currently still the most successful and the most lucrative system.
[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:07.001]  The corrupt form
[03:17:08.390 --> 03:17:13.435]  I wouldn't say it's completely evil, because it's targeting folks that just always want to pay more.
[03:17:14.396 --> 03:17:22.285]  It's a system where you put everything into it being elite and being top end and the most expensive.
[03:17:23.126 --> 03:17:28.451]  And in almost every case, what's in it does not measure up even close to what it's costing.
[03:17:29.513 --> 03:17:30.794]  Now, I've got a little bit of money.
[03:17:31.650 --> 03:17:31.790]  Yes.
[03:17:47.188 --> 03:17:48.129]  Wasting for no reason.
[03:17:48.149 --> 03:17:50.671]  I'd rather give it to charity or something like that.
[03:17:51.571 --> 03:17:54.313]  But that's the two different schools I thought I wanted to get into.
[03:17:54.793 --> 03:18:06.082]  The one where they know that if something's supposedly the best, you say it's the best, even though it's not, and you charge an outrageous amount, people believe it must be the best because it's an outrageous amount.
[03:18:06.642 --> 03:18:07.823]  Now, here's what I do.
[03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:14.185]  I go out of my own life and I find what is the best for the very lowest price.
[03:18:14.525 --> 03:18:15.085]  And here's an example.
[03:18:15.346 --> 03:18:18.168]  I have a Dodge Hellcat that came out four years ago.
[03:18:18.428 --> 03:18:21.130]  I didn't want a really fast sports car because I didn't want to be flashy.
[03:18:21.371 --> 03:18:24.033]  I was at the Dodge dealership with my truck and the guy was illiterate.
[03:18:24.053 --> 03:18:24.974]  He said, have you heard of Hellcats?
[03:18:24.994 --> 03:18:26.055]  They're going to be coming out in about a year.
[03:18:26.095 --> 03:18:27.656]  And I said, uh, no.
[03:18:27.676 --> 03:18:31.219]  And he said, well, it's a Dodge Challenger, 700 plus horsepower.
[03:18:31.359 --> 03:18:31.659]  It's only $63,000.
[03:18:32.480 --> 03:18:34.482]  And Ferrari owns us now.
[03:18:34.802 --> 03:18:37.124]  And to have a car like this would cost like half a million dollars.
[03:18:37.544 --> 03:18:42.046]  And it didn't stick out, but I like a really fast, cool car, so I have the best of both worlds.
[03:18:42.066 --> 03:18:45.148]  It looks like a Challenger, but I've driven one of my friend's Ferraris.
[03:18:45.208 --> 03:18:46.148]  It's as fast.
[03:18:46.348 --> 03:18:46.909]  It's insane.
[03:18:47.149 --> 03:18:48.329]  That's my mindset.
[03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:53.872]  I want a badass, black Ferrari for $63,000 instead of a half million or a million.
[03:18:54.132 --> 03:18:55.433]  I mean, you'll be $2 million for a Ferrari.
[03:18:56.273 --> 03:18:57.254]  I don't want the bling.
[03:18:57.454 --> 03:18:58.716]  I want the zing.
[03:18:58.736 --> 03:19:03.860]  We sold out for their year of in-sale of the Alexa Pure Pro gravity-fed filter.
[03:19:03.920 --> 03:19:04.541]  We sold it all out.
[03:19:04.881 --> 03:19:05.962]  They didn't think we could do it.
[03:19:06.143 --> 03:19:06.623]  You bought it.
[03:19:06.663 --> 03:19:07.404]  It's a great system.
[03:19:07.624 --> 03:19:09.506]  You got it for basically 49% off, half off.
[03:19:09.686 --> 03:19:10.567]  They've never done that.
[03:19:11.047 --> 03:19:16.112]  They're going to do the Alexa Pure Rees, that is, an ion filter, normally $250.
[03:19:16.412 --> 03:19:18.013]  Leading competitors aren't as good, they're $800.
[03:19:18.073 --> 03:19:19.234]  It's the same deal.
[03:19:19.715 --> 03:19:23.018]  Similar systems, four-stage ions, that aren't even as good, $400, $600, $800, depending on the unit.
[03:19:23.038 --> 03:19:23.418]  This is normally $240, $250.
[03:19:26.861 --> 03:19:27.021]  It's $127.
[03:19:27.541 --> 03:19:30.302]  Again, they're selling them to us at cost.
[03:19:30.682 --> 03:19:34.263]  We make like $30, and it clears out their end-of-year inventory.
[03:19:34.703 --> 03:19:36.743]  And it's so good for your house, so good for your family.
[03:19:36.963 --> 03:19:37.503]  It's amazing.

[03:19:40.984 --> 03:19:49.006]  It is the Hellcat of air filtration compared to the Ferraris that aren't even as good but have a so-called bling and cost five times more.

[03:20:06.241 --> 03:20:08.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.728 --> 03:20:23.780]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:25.302 --> 03:20:29.003]  All right, well, John and MegaTitan and Ken and Jim, we're going to get to get on air.
[03:20:29.043 --> 03:20:32.765]  But Owen Benjamin, this happens with the magic of Skype, cannot get our audio.
[03:20:32.925 --> 03:20:35.926]  If we have to, next segment, I'll just over phone let him know he's on air.
[03:20:36.246 --> 03:20:40.167]  So I want to hear what he has to say in post, because he's a sought-after comedian, really smart guy.
[03:20:40.187 --> 03:20:49.651]  But John in Wyoming, I'm going from memory, but is this a guy that was at the 1980 convention, who's been calling for like 20 years on the show, only calls in when we talk about Ronald Reagan and George Herbert Walker Bush?
[03:20:50.051 --> 03:20:51.411]  Is this that John or another John?
[03:20:51.471 --> 03:20:52.572]  John, welcome to the Airwaves.
[03:20:53.092 --> 03:20:54.494]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[03:20:55.074 --> 03:21:02.243]  It's the John who told the anti-gunners at the Houston NRA convention, fill your hand, you SOB.
[03:21:03.044 --> 03:21:10.432]  You're awesome, and we're gonna, I'm always a year behind, but we're getting you ready to be hosting a show soon, so we got your number, get ready, hadn't heard from you in six months, good to have you here.
[03:21:10.792 --> 03:21:13.676]  What do you make of this George Herbert Walker Bush worship and all of it?
[03:21:14.344 --> 03:21:15.746]  Well, here's the whole point.
[03:21:15.906 --> 03:21:29.422]  I knew that he was a scoundrel from way back, because when I was living in Houston in 1968, he was my congressman from the 22nd Congressional District, and he voted for the Gun Control Act of 1968.
[03:21:31.374 --> 03:21:34.115]  Then, three years later, when he was Nixon's U.N.
[03:21:34.175 --> 03:21:43.640]  ambassador, when they voted to illegally expel Nationalist China from the Security Council and replace them with Communist China, he abstained.
[03:21:43.700 --> 03:21:46.722]  He allowed that vote to go through when he could have vetoed it.
[03:21:47.342 --> 03:22:00.566]  Also, when he was Reagan's vice president, remember Reagan, one good thing Reagan did is he built up the Navy to over 600 surface ships and submarines, so America would be strong.
[03:22:00.726 --> 03:22:02.727]  And as soon as Bush became president,
[03:22:03.107 --> 03:22:12.396]  He started dismantling the Navy and scrapping hundreds of surface ships and submarines to weaken this country so we would be vulnerable.
[03:22:12.896 --> 03:22:19.723]  Also, while he was a CFR member, he was also on the board of directors of the CFR from 1977 to 1979.
[03:22:20.023 --> 03:22:25.849]  And let's not forget, Reagan and Goldwater gave speeches against him directly.
[03:22:26.804 --> 03:22:37.920]  Right, and what Goldwater wrote in his wonderful 1979 book, With No Apologies, page 126, for those of you who think the CFR is some innocuous group,
[03:22:38.504 --> 03:22:44.447]  Goldwater wrote, the CFR is the American branch of the society which originated in England.
[03:22:44.927 --> 03:22:59.534]  Internationalist in viewpoint, the CFR, along with the Atlantic Union Movement and the Atlantic Council of the United States, believes national boundaries should be obliterated and one world rule established.
[03:23:00.294 --> 03:23:02.015]  And again, that's Cecil Rhodes.
[03:23:03.215 --> 03:23:05.556]  And again, it's not like Kumbaya world government.
[03:23:05.676 --> 03:23:06.817]  It's a world government run by them.
[03:23:06.857 --> 03:23:07.557]  They're above the law.
[03:23:08.037 --> 03:23:11.699]  And so his death, the Clintons can't fill any stadiums, even 10%.
[03:23:12.639 --> 03:23:17.021]  This is all seen as a symbolic, really, death of the New World Order.
[03:23:17.061 --> 03:23:18.962]  What do you make of that, John?
[03:23:20.082 --> 03:23:20.543]  I agree.
[03:23:20.583 --> 03:23:26.265]  And remember, for the 208 weeks that Bush was president, that's four full years.
[03:23:26.849 --> 03:23:33.493]  He made over 208 speeches mentioning the term New World Order over and over again.
[03:23:33.513 --> 03:23:42.317]  Which is the UN running our country, and then it's well known that he actually ran the Clintons and the CIA, that's what he classified, with Kordmeier and a bunch of other people.
[03:23:43.138 --> 03:23:54.304]  And so what happened is... Also, he was also the only adult in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963, who could not remember what he was doing that day.
[03:23:54.994 --> 03:24:00.760]  But it did turn out he was photographed there, outside the Book Depository building, and that he was at the CIA.
[03:24:00.900 --> 03:24:05.765]  You know, they always said he wasn't at the CIA, but then he became the director of it, out of nowhere in the 70s.
[03:24:06.445 --> 03:24:07.867]  So here's the bottom line.
[03:24:07.887 --> 03:24:09.468]  He was a horrible globalist.
[03:24:10.109 --> 03:24:16.653]  Who parlayed American power, his family were always social climbers, just like they were the head Nazi agents.
[03:24:16.733 --> 03:24:22.736]  I mean, these people were always the folks that were trying to climb and get into power.
[03:24:22.836 --> 03:24:30.621]  And now, the Clintons and Obama were all an extension of their stay-behind group in the CIA, and Trump is breaking that right now.
[03:24:30.881 --> 03:24:32.322]  And you can see how hard they're fighting.
[03:24:33.002 --> 03:24:38.045]  You can see how hard they're fighting because this is, they're having, their deep state is being broken.
[03:24:38.905 --> 03:24:41.987]  They're going to try to assassinate President Trump.
[03:24:42.107 --> 03:24:42.708]  I feel it.
[03:24:43.328 --> 03:24:45.009]  And I think I'm funny.
[03:24:45.029 --> 03:24:52.274]  You said that I had a dream last night that I went and saw Trump lying in state like a debtor in a doornail.
[03:24:52.674 --> 03:24:53.715]  And I hope that doesn't happen.
[03:24:53.955 --> 03:24:55.716]  But I'm telling you, it's an archetypal worry.
[03:24:56.076 --> 03:24:57.998]  I'm telling you, they know they can't beat him.
[03:24:58.258 --> 03:24:59.138]  They're going to try to kill him.
[03:24:59.158 --> 03:24:59.559]  I agree.
[03:25:00.159 --> 03:25:04.402]  The same way with JFK, because JFK, before they murdered him,
[03:25:05.029 --> 03:25:16.177]  Issued Executive Order 11110 on June 4th, 1963, which recalled these fraudulent Federal Reserve notes and replaced them with debt-free... Oh, he said he'd do it.
[03:25:16.257 --> 03:25:16.917]  And let me bring this up.
[03:25:16.998 --> 03:25:22.301]  Anytime I feel sorry for myself with the lawsuits, the threats, the attacks, I think about how much more Trump's lost.
[03:25:22.461 --> 03:25:24.163]  $2 billion, his whole family under attack.
[03:25:24.803 --> 03:25:27.045]  And I just think about what he's gone through for this country.
[03:25:27.785 --> 03:25:29.166]  And, you know, there is a God.
[03:25:29.246 --> 03:25:29.846]  I mean, literally.
[03:25:29.866 --> 03:25:31.347]  And I'm not trying to kiss Trump's butt, it's true.
[03:25:31.687 --> 03:25:40.331]  God gave us Donald Trump at this moment, and all these other nationalists are winning everywhere else, and they're stabbing them in the stomach, and shooting at them, and threatening them.
[03:25:40.671 --> 03:25:42.432]  This is a war for humanity, brother.
[03:25:42.452 --> 03:25:42.972]  This is real.
[03:25:43.292 --> 03:25:44.493]  Trump is real.
[03:25:44.573 --> 03:25:45.413]  He is real.
[03:25:46.174 --> 03:25:56.779]  When you see all the Trump haters on the network news media, praising and worshipping at the altar of George Herbert Walker Bush, you know that they're birds of a feather.
[03:25:57.711 --> 03:26:04.856]  But I agree, but when we get persecuted for supporting Trump, doesn't it make it easier knowing what he's gone through?
[03:26:04.876 --> 03:26:07.518]  I mean, people think, everybody asks, how are you doing?
[03:26:07.578 --> 03:26:08.299]  How are you taking it?
[03:26:08.639 --> 03:26:09.940]  And I'm like, I've never been better.
[03:26:10.020 --> 03:26:11.341]  I mean, I'm doing what I'm supposed to.
[03:26:11.401 --> 03:26:12.522]  I'm in a war for my country.
[03:26:13.042 --> 03:26:15.564]  And I've got a president that I know is for real.
[03:26:16.405 --> 03:26:17.706]  We ask God for this.
[03:26:18.606 --> 03:26:20.408]  This isn't a bad thing is what I'm saying, John.
[03:26:21.409 --> 03:26:25.972]  Well, I still think that sooner or later what the globalists are going to realize
[03:26:26.494 --> 03:26:28.135]  I don't care how much money you have.
[03:26:28.195 --> 03:26:37.082]  Look at that idiot, Michael Bloomberg, who said two years ago, when he dies, he knows he's going straight to heaven, and he won't have any time for any interviews.
[03:26:37.162 --> 03:26:38.423]  Well, I have news for them.
[03:26:38.763 --> 03:26:45.928]  They'd better get used to extremely hot weather, because when Jesus judges these people, they're going straight to hell.
[03:26:46.028 --> 03:26:47.169]  Do not pass go.
[03:26:47.269 --> 03:26:48.089]  Do not collect $200,000.
[03:26:48.350 --> 03:26:51.312]  No, I agree, but let's just get back to Trump.
[03:26:52.409 --> 03:26:55.853]  He has gone through living hell, and he only gets stronger at 72.
[03:26:55.913 --> 03:27:02.561]  I'm 45, and I can handle it, but my God, I mean, who could give it something like, Reagan didn't have the stamina.
[03:27:02.961 --> 03:27:09.950]  I mean, and they all bitch and snipe and spin everything he does, but if you really sit back and look at Trump, he is a godsend.
[03:27:11.502 --> 03:27:21.390]  He cares about the American people, something these globalist low-lifes like the Bushes and the Clintons and the Obamas and the rest of those guys don't care about.
[03:27:21.430 --> 03:27:22.571]  They think it's weak to care about people.
[03:27:22.852 --> 03:27:24.313]  They think it's weak to care about people.
[03:27:25.494 --> 03:27:26.895]  Well, it isn't weak.
[03:27:27.055 --> 03:27:39.866]  It means that he has a good Christian heart, and he is following God's commandments, and he is doing what is best for America and for the American people, and the globalists be damned.
[03:27:42.011 --> 03:27:44.153]  It means they stand for nothing but their own damn power.
[03:27:44.393 --> 03:27:45.013]  It's unbelievable.
[03:27:45.514 --> 03:27:45.794]  All right.
[03:27:45.814 --> 03:27:46.534]  God bless you, John.
[03:27:46.574 --> 03:27:47.395]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:47.615 --> 03:27:51.158]  Did we get Owen Benjamin's Skype working?
[03:27:53.840 --> 03:27:54.300]  All right.
[03:27:54.901 --> 03:27:58.283]  We'll go to him via phone, because he'll be Skype audio, but he'll have phones.
[03:27:58.363 --> 03:27:59.524]  I'll introduce him, bring him in.
[03:28:00.004 --> 03:28:00.645]  We'll come back.
[03:28:01.185 --> 03:28:01.445]  Wow.
[03:28:02.466 --> 03:28:02.947]  Look, it's true.
[03:28:03.982 --> 03:28:05.103]  I don't care about Hollywood.
[03:28:05.143 --> 03:28:06.624]  I don't care about being on red carpets.
[03:28:07.324 --> 03:28:09.066]  I don't care about... They tried to buy me off with all that.
[03:28:09.326 --> 03:28:10.927]  But some people said, oh, why are you supporting Trump?
[03:28:11.347 --> 03:28:12.388]  Just give up on Trump.
[03:28:12.408 --> 03:28:21.394]  I mean, I was even told... I'm not going to say... I can't say this, but... Let's just say, I've been threatened with them taking everything I've got.
[03:28:23.436 --> 03:28:24.156]  My children, everything.
[03:28:24.176 --> 03:28:27.499]  And at the end of the day, I told the system I'm not doing it.
[03:28:29.200 --> 03:28:33.443]  But the average person cannot deal with that level of oppression.
[03:28:34.915 --> 03:28:35.955]  And that's what we're dealing with here.
[03:28:36.496 --> 03:28:40.477]  So it's up to those of us that can, that are built for this, to do it.
[03:28:41.518 --> 03:28:42.518]  And that's what it comes down to.
[03:28:43.739 --> 03:28:46.060]  And once you're built for this, you realize it's like a joke.
[03:28:48.701 --> 03:28:49.361]  Built for this?
[03:28:51.162 --> 03:28:56.024]  What I'm not built for is rolling over on my belly and letting these wolves pull my guts out.
[03:28:57.085 --> 03:28:57.305]  Yeah.
[03:28:57.885 --> 03:28:58.785]  I'm built for survival.
[03:29:02.227 --> 03:29:03.928]  We have been in a continual state of war.
[03:29:04.969 --> 03:29:09.491]  Since we bought into the idea of a permanent standing army after World War II.
[03:29:10.271 --> 03:29:16.454]  We have a Saudi-led attack on Yemen on the port, escalating in just a 24-hour span.
[03:29:16.674 --> 03:29:20.195]  At least 150 people killed after weeks of deadly fighting.
[03:29:20.555 --> 03:29:22.616]  Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen.
[03:29:22.976 --> 03:29:23.777]  Any reporting on that?
[03:29:24.117 --> 03:29:24.297]  No.
[03:29:24.937 --> 03:29:26.398]  They don't care about the lives of people.
[03:29:26.418 --> 03:29:28.379]  They don't care about the lives of these Yemenis.
[03:29:28.419 --> 03:29:31.580]  They don't care about the lives of their own soldiers.
[03:29:32.825 --> 03:29:36.907]  And they don't care about the principles that these soldiers thought they were fighting for either.
[03:29:37.587 --> 03:29:44.691]  The principles, just like the lives of the soldiers, are expendable in these manufactured wars for empire.
[03:29:45.331 --> 03:29:48.152]  And we've got something that is much more dangerous that is coming up right now.
[03:29:49.013 --> 03:29:55.055]  We're coming up to a cycle in human history, a generational turning point.
[03:29:55.656 --> 03:29:58.477]  And again, you should read the book, Fourth Turning, if you haven't.
[03:29:59.666 --> 03:30:09.552]  Strauss and Howe went back 500 years in American and English-British history to see this recurring cycle about every 80 years having a major restructuring of society.
[03:30:10.713 --> 03:30:13.875]  Frequently, these restructurings are accompanied by wars.
[03:30:14.815 --> 03:30:19.118]  Things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II, those were all fourth-term plans.
[03:30:20.544 --> 03:30:26.287]  Now, as we talk about resurging old demons, that's what I see coming.
[03:30:26.787 --> 03:30:28.648]  I see history being recycled.
[03:30:30.228 --> 03:30:49.677]  And when you have these standing armies, when you have these politicians who have an empire mindset like Mackle, who are trying to accrue and concentrate power to themselves, those are the elements that create things like World War I. Because it was a type of thing
[03:30:50.397 --> 03:30:55.981]  That the founders had always looked at Europe as having these constant, eternal European wars.
[03:30:56.161 --> 03:30:57.402]  Not a remaking of society.
[03:30:58.363 --> 03:31:00.685]  Because, you know, people look at that and they say, that was a just war.
[03:31:00.965 --> 03:31:02.586]  That was a justifiable war.
[03:31:02.666 --> 03:31:02.886]  Whatever.
[03:31:02.906 --> 03:31:09.411]  They look at the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, they look at World War II and they say, yeah, that was a time when we were really fighting for something.
[03:31:09.451 --> 03:31:10.772]  World War I, they weren't fighting for anything.
[03:31:12.034 --> 03:31:14.455]  Patriotism was summed up by Smedley Butler.
[03:31:14.735 --> 03:31:19.716]  He said, talking about true patriotism, he said, we fight to protect our home.
[03:31:19.836 --> 03:31:22.316]  And our Constitution.
[03:31:22.336 --> 03:31:24.177]  So we fight to defend our lives.
[03:31:24.237 --> 03:31:26.437]  To defend our lives.
[03:31:27.137 --> 03:31:29.598]  Not in foreign wars of empire.
[03:31:30.338 --> 03:31:32.478]  Not for regime change in the Middle East.
[03:31:33.019 --> 03:31:34.619]  We fight to defend our homes.
[03:31:34.639 --> 03:31:36.459]  He said, everything else is a racket.
[03:31:36.899 --> 03:31:38.520]  It is organized crime.
[03:31:38.600 --> 03:31:39.540]  And he was exactly right.
[03:31:40.874 --> 03:31:43.756]  When we fight to defend our Constitution, we're fighting to defend our values.
[03:31:44.637 --> 03:31:45.838]  That is what nationalism is about.
[03:31:45.958 --> 03:31:49.020]  Patriotism is about fighting to defend your homeland.
[03:31:49.881 --> 03:31:58.268]  Nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system and the values embodied in that political and legal system in our Constitution.
[03:32:00.109 --> 03:32:03.232]  And if we had stuck to those values, we would have never been drawn into World War I.
[03:32:04.733 --> 03:32:11.083]  Maybe Emmanuel Macron should read the writing of our former president James Madison, father of the Bill of Rights.
[03:32:11.824 --> 03:32:12.705]  He said throughout Europe...
[03:32:13.641 --> 03:32:19.204]  The armies kept under the pretext of defending have enslaved the people.
[03:32:20.605 --> 03:32:26.408]  And quite frankly, that is the true purpose of Macron's EU army.
[03:32:27.708 --> 03:32:30.930]  He's not going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions.
[03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:32.811]  He's inviting the foreign invaders.
[03:32:33.812 --> 03:32:37.814]  The fifth column coming into the country.
[03:32:37.854 --> 03:32:38.794]  He's opened up the borders.
[03:32:38.834 --> 03:32:41.296]  He's part of the globalist open border cartel.
[03:32:43.039 --> 03:32:45.900]  He is not going to defend people.
[03:32:45.920 --> 03:32:50.601]  He's going to use the army to attack the people who object to that.
[03:32:50.741 --> 03:32:53.822]  To object to having their homes destroyed.
[03:32:53.922 --> 03:33:00.804]  Armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.
[03:33:06.205 --> 03:33:08.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.630 --> 03:33:24.471]  Alright, Owen Benjamin, we really appreciate him hosting once a week for a full hour.
[03:33:24.591 --> 03:33:27.311]  Top comedian, one of the most banned people in the world, Owen Benjamin.
[03:33:27.691 --> 03:33:30.672]  Huge pianist, that doesn't mean pee-pee, it means piano.
[03:33:30.692 --> 03:33:35.473]  He's a 6'6", big linebacker-looking guy, or NFL lineman-looking guy.
[03:33:35.913 --> 03:33:37.913]  Plays the piano quite well, hugepianist.com.
[03:33:38.353 --> 03:33:44.834]  He's taking over right now, I'm gonna ride shotgun because his Skype doesn't get audio from us, so that when he goes in and out of breaks, he'll be here.
[03:33:44.874 --> 03:33:46.415]  Just briefly, because I didn't plug last hour.
[03:33:46.435 --> 03:33:48.935]  I get so caught up in the news, if we don't do this, we won't be here.
[03:33:50.379 --> 03:33:54.502]  You know George Soros openly has gone after our payment processors and taken five of six.
[03:33:55.062 --> 03:33:56.483]  They're trying to shut down our shopping cart.
[03:33:57.904 --> 03:34:01.106]  As long as your order gets in, we'll get it out to you.
[03:34:01.486 --> 03:34:05.989]  We're selling everything out at sales 30, 40, 50 percent bigger than we've ever done.
[03:34:07.694 --> 03:34:09.075]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[03:34:09.395 --> 03:34:10.496]  We have 50 to 75% off.
[03:34:10.797 --> 03:34:12.258]  That means the lowest sale.
[03:34:12.418 --> 03:34:13.679]  Everything's 50 to 75% off.
[03:34:14.079 --> 03:34:14.980]  50 is the lowest.
[03:34:15.140 --> 03:34:16.041]  Everything's 50% off.
[03:34:16.401 --> 03:34:18.603]  Storable food, water filtration, air filtration.
[03:34:18.623 --> 03:34:19.323]  50 to 75% off.
[03:34:21.810 --> 03:34:26.935]  And double Patriot points at a 5%, 10%, so 10 cents on every dollar towards your future purchase.
[03:34:27.816 --> 03:34:28.777]  And a free t-shirt.
[03:34:29.238 --> 03:34:30.999]  They printed 5,000 of this bad boy.
[03:34:31.119 --> 03:34:32.020]  It'll go in a couple days.
[03:34:32.040 --> 03:34:32.801]  We'll have the next shirt.
[03:34:33.682 --> 03:34:35.244]  And it's, uh, we are all Alex Jones.
[03:34:35.284 --> 03:34:37.246]  Not my idea, but the news has all pointed that out.
[03:34:37.786 --> 03:34:38.847]  Even Ted Cruz did that.
[03:34:39.228 --> 03:34:41.210]  And it says, don't censor me with a Gadsden flag.
[03:34:41.250 --> 03:34:45.194]  You get that free, in every order, on top of it.
[03:34:46.310 --> 03:34:47.271]  So you want to trigger folks?
[03:34:47.371 --> 03:34:47.831]  There it is.
[03:34:47.891 --> 03:34:51.453]  Very nice soft black t-shirt with the Gadsden snake on it.
[03:34:51.914 --> 03:34:52.894]  InfowarStore.com.
[03:34:52.914 --> 03:34:54.075]  But don't battle the crowds.
[03:34:54.095 --> 03:34:54.995]  This is a pretty easy sell.
[03:34:56.236 --> 03:34:57.077]  Don't battle the crowds.
[03:34:57.117 --> 03:34:57.977]  Don't battle the traffic.
[03:34:58.477 --> 03:34:59.158]  Get supplements.
[03:34:59.198 --> 03:34:59.798]  Get videos.
[03:34:59.818 --> 03:35:00.278]  Get books.
[03:35:00.319 --> 03:35:00.919]  Get t-shirts.
[03:35:00.939 --> 03:35:01.499]  Get materials.
[03:35:01.939 --> 03:35:04.701]  And fund the Infowar at InfowarStore.com.
[03:35:05.061 --> 03:35:06.482]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:35:07.683 --> 03:35:09.364]  And without you, we will not be here.
[03:35:09.484 --> 03:35:11.225]  But quite frankly, most of these are lost leaders.
[03:35:11.685 --> 03:35:13.386]  We're clearing out the warehouse, so please take action.
[03:35:13.726 --> 03:35:14.027]  Okay!
[03:35:14.958 --> 03:35:15.759]  It's not his fault.
[03:35:15.819 --> 03:35:16.599]  Skype is crazy.
[03:35:16.639 --> 03:35:18.420]  It's great technology, but you never figure it out.
[03:35:18.861 --> 03:35:26.646]  Owen Benjamin of HugePianist.com, censored because he doesn't want five-year-olds to be taught how to suck golf balls through garden hoses.
[03:35:26.666 --> 03:35:28.327]  He believes there's two genders.
[03:35:28.808 --> 03:35:30.489]  He also believes two plus two equals four.
[03:35:30.569 --> 03:35:33.311]  Another thought crime he committed, which I almost don't forgive him for.
[03:35:33.351 --> 03:35:34.391]  That one's really racist.
[03:35:34.972 --> 03:35:37.874]  But Owen, thank you for joining us, and tell us what you got coming up today.
[03:35:38.985 --> 03:35:40.026]  Oh, thanks for having me out.
[03:35:40.586 --> 03:35:44.968]  I'm going to discuss my namesake of my website, Huge Pianist.
[03:35:44.988 --> 03:35:46.469]  We're going to talk about music.
[03:35:46.489 --> 03:35:51.611]  I've got a piano right here and we're going to talk about the power of music and comedy and why it's so centered.
[03:35:52.112 --> 03:36:00.956]  I'm about to embark tomorrow on a tour and we have to sell, I would sell tickets for the city but not the location because if I said the location, SJW
[03:36:05.568 --> 03:36:15.835]  I don't know how many of them there are, but I did a tour like seven months ago, and seven out of seven of the venues canceled on me because of complaints.
[03:36:15.855 --> 03:36:19.577]  So now we sell a city, and then I email the people where it is.
[03:36:19.597 --> 03:36:20.838]  It's almost like a comedy speakeasy.
[03:36:21.618 --> 03:36:26.942]  And I started thinking about it, like, why is it music and comedy that's so...
[03:36:28.007 --> 03:36:29.568]  Yeah, I'm going to turn myself down a little bit.
[03:36:29.588 --> 03:36:32.491]  Yeah, Skype is wacky, but I'm going to turn this down a little bit so you guys can hear me.
[03:36:32.511 --> 03:36:32.991]  No, that's fine.
[03:36:33.051 --> 03:36:35.693]  And then I'll tell you when we're going to break, in like seven minutes.
[03:36:35.733 --> 03:36:36.014]  Go ahead.
[03:36:36.114 --> 03:36:36.534]  Oh, great.
[03:36:36.674 --> 03:36:38.436]  Awesome.
[03:36:38.496 --> 03:36:46.762]  So, uh, why... I didn't... When I first got into comedy and music, I had no idea the amount of, uh, like, mind control it has over people.
[03:36:47.443 --> 03:36:48.784]  Like, I'm going to show you something.
[03:36:48.804 --> 03:36:54.589]  Like, right now, I'm like a band comedian, and I'm, like, not allowed in Hollywood and stuff, but if you could think
[03:36:55.535 --> 03:36:58.476]  Who's the most leftist famous female movie star?
[03:36:59.636 --> 03:37:02.836]  I'll show you a clip right now of how it used to be.
[03:37:03.116 --> 03:37:04.257]  This was three years ago.
[03:37:04.877 --> 03:37:07.417]  This is Anne Hathaway and her opinion on me.
[03:37:07.437 --> 03:37:09.258]  Hello.
[03:37:11.758 --> 03:37:16.859]  Who else here is a massive fan of Owen Benjamin now?
[03:37:19.940 --> 03:37:20.980]  He's so incredible.
[03:37:23.106 --> 03:37:28.750]  And the only reason I'm playing that is because I just want to show how music and comedy has a way of uniting.
[03:37:30.931 --> 03:37:31.892]  Hey, I gotta turn this down.
[03:37:31.912 --> 03:37:32.892]  I'm gonna drive my son home.
[03:37:32.912 --> 03:37:33.493]  No, I understand.
[03:37:33.713 --> 03:37:36.515]  You couldn't get Skype audio to us or you, and then you went with that.
[03:37:36.975 --> 03:37:41.498]  And when we all learn these tricks dealing with this, you might want to keep the phone maybe in front of you than doing it.
[03:37:41.518 --> 03:37:42.979]  Then just go audio phone only.
[03:37:43.019 --> 03:37:44.059]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:37:44.079 --> 03:37:44.820]  We're gonna work through these.
[03:37:44.860 --> 03:37:45.941]  We're gonna work through these problems together.
[03:37:45.961 --> 03:37:46.561]  We're gonna work through it!
[03:37:48.357 --> 03:37:56.542]  So anyway, what I was saying is comedy and music have a way of uniting people, and as we see with, like, globalism, they really need us to not be united.
[03:37:56.622 --> 03:38:04.667]  And here's another clip of my, now my buddy, Tommy Robinson, and the power, the political power of just a song.
[03:38:04.787 --> 03:38:13.712]  And I had no idea how powerful these things are, but watch this little video about the progress of what an honest song can do for somebody.
[03:38:13.752 --> 03:38:14.993]  And a song you created, here it is.
[03:38:15.725 --> 03:38:18.928]  So, we've all seen the process of the Tommy Robinson song, right?
[03:38:18.968 --> 03:38:19.909]  So, we're riffing it.
[03:38:19.929 --> 03:38:21.410]  Alright, so let's do it.
[03:38:21.490 --> 03:38:27.435]  Let's write the Tommy Robinson, I Heard There Was a Secret Court.
[03:38:27.876 --> 03:38:28.796]  We all write it together.
[03:38:28.816 --> 03:38:30.278]  I do it on this thing.
[03:38:30.298 --> 03:38:37.404]  I heard there was a secret court where journalists weren't allowed to report.
[03:38:37.524 --> 03:38:40.507]  But you don't really care for freedom.
[03:38:43.544 --> 03:38:48.346]  And then I do it live and everyone's like, oh no way, like that became that.
[03:39:02.070 --> 03:39:02.351]  Right?
[03:39:02.511 --> 03:39:04.592]  And then Coddington did a cover.
[03:39:04.913 --> 03:39:11.077]  And then Tommy Robinson and his guys heard it.
[03:39:31.437 --> 03:39:42.083]  And then they contacted me to do a studio version so that they can sell it in the UK to get money for Tommy's wife.
[03:39:43.083 --> 03:39:44.584]  So that happened.
[03:39:44.624 --> 03:39:45.505]  That's now happening.
[03:39:46.165 --> 03:39:54.710]  When a soldier in freedom goes to jail and they have a wife and they have a mission
[03:39:56.570 --> 03:39:59.592]  Your role at that point is to keep their name being heard.
[03:39:59.913 --> 03:40:02.714]  And being preachy doesn't really work.
[03:40:03.715 --> 03:40:05.356]  That's why this song is so sweet.
[03:40:05.776 --> 03:40:07.257]  Alright, so check out what Coddington made.
[03:40:07.558 --> 03:40:10.179]  Kids look up to you for truth.
[03:40:10.600 --> 03:40:16.724]  Please don't say, baby, this is now how they rule ya.
[03:40:16.764 --> 03:40:19.445]  How they rule ya.
[03:40:20.146 --> 03:40:23.108]  How they rule ya.
[03:40:23.168 --> 03:40:24.649]  How they rule ya.
[03:40:26.383 --> 03:40:29.205]  This is my thank you to Ali and Benjamin in America.
[03:40:30.286 --> 03:40:48.561]  It became a rallying cry and then when I saw that all these people were singing it in England it dawned on me why art and why beauty and why like
[03:40:50.922 --> 03:40:56.523]  Just any semblance of good or quality is taken out of our life because it inspires people.
[03:40:57.323 --> 03:40:59.884]  And that's kind of like what we're facing right now.
[03:40:59.904 --> 03:41:06.025]  Because I was talking to my wife about this because she knows a lot about architecture and fashion.
[03:41:06.045 --> 03:41:08.245]  And she was saying the same thing would happen with architecture.
[03:41:09.506 --> 03:41:13.666]  Like this intentional ugly building or an intentionally ugly outfit.
[03:41:14.126 --> 03:41:17.047]  And I was going to show you guys today, probably in the next segment,
[03:41:17.814 --> 03:41:19.955]  How it works and how it happens.
[03:41:19.995 --> 03:41:27.916]  Oh yeah, the leftist-run CIA admitted 40 years ago, they began to put out ugly, dehumanizing architecture, sexualization of children.
[03:41:27.956 --> 03:41:41.960]  This is all done to show, like you did last week, Jenner, you know, is this ugly man, you know, this hit-and-run guy, and if this is the most beautiful woman on earth, you'll believe that a pile of crap is chocolate ice cream.
[03:41:42.560 --> 03:41:47.103]  So they're giving you a big pile of feces saying, no, it's Dutch chocolate ice cream.
[03:41:47.143 --> 03:41:47.883]  No, no, it's not.
[03:41:49.364 --> 03:41:49.544]  I know.
[03:41:49.604 --> 03:41:58.049]  And if you don't eat the crap and think it's chocolate ice cream, you're a bigot, racist, homophobe, and you don't deserve to be on Twitter, YouTube or Apple.
[03:41:58.610 --> 03:41:59.470]  And that's exactly it.
[03:41:59.530 --> 03:42:03.333]  The real the real art of modern art isn't the art.
[03:42:03.513 --> 03:42:06.374]  It's getting people to buy it for exorbitant amounts of money.
[03:42:06.414 --> 03:42:08.736]  It's almost like the mind control art where they're
[03:42:10.300 --> 03:42:14.302]  Just a dot on a piece of paper and someone will pay millions of dollars for it.
[03:42:14.742 --> 03:42:20.644]  The real art is the art of war in that, where they can subvert people to the point where they don't even know what good looks like.
[03:42:21.064 --> 03:42:28.146]  And once they've broken the individual, and once they've broken the thing to strive for, it's a subverted population.
[03:42:28.206 --> 03:42:30.927]  And at that point, anybody can take over.
[03:42:31.087 --> 03:42:35.389]  And that's why it's important to just fight against that and still make what is good.
[03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:43.615]  And I want to compare hip-hop and country music too, like the different messages of these people, and like how it all works.
[03:42:43.815 --> 03:42:50.460]  Owen Benjamin, HugePianist.com, one of the most centric medias in the world, will be with us live on the other side of this quick break.
[03:42:50.880 --> 03:42:59.867]  Whatever you do, share the live links at InfoWars.com, forward slash show, and tell folks at the local station you're listening to, yes, Telling the Truth is a revolutionary act.
[03:43:02.472 --> 03:43:08.941]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:43:10.646 --> 03:43:12.088]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:43:12.328 --> 03:43:17.273]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[03:43:18.434 --> 03:43:24.361]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:43:25.141 --> 03:43:32.789]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:59.720]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[03:44:00.962 --> 03:44:07.285]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[03:44:07.725 --> 03:44:09.486]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[03:44:09.546 --> 03:44:14.469]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[03:44:14.929 --> 03:44:15.429]  It's big.
[03:44:15.970 --> 03:44:16.390]  It's bad.
[03:44:16.830 --> 03:44:22.053]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[03:44:22.073 --> 03:44:24.374]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[03:44:24.814 --> 03:44:28.016]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[03:44:28.617 --> 03:44:29.580]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:44:29.600 --> 03:44:30.784]  That's been going on for over a month.
[03:44:31.546 --> 03:44:32.770]  50 to 75% off.
[03:44:32.790 --> 03:44:33.814]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[03:44:34.858 --> 03:44:35.819]  The Double Patriot points.
[03:44:35.839 --> 03:44:36.739]  That's what happened in about a week.
[03:44:37.099 --> 03:44:43.723]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[03:44:44.183 --> 03:44:48.565]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:48.585 --> 03:44:50.466]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[03:44:50.726 --> 03:44:52.547]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[03:44:52.728 --> 03:44:54.789]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:44:54.949 --> 03:44:58.971]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[03:45:06.221 --> 03:45:14.764]  I've been on air 23 plus years, and I've learned a lot about sales, because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and our way of life.
[03:45:15.544 --> 03:45:20.126]  I was never classically trained, but over the last 23 years, I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[03:45:20.846 --> 03:45:26.108]  And there's lots of philosophies about having something really, really expensive, and a certain percentage will buy it, believing it's the best.
[03:45:26.908 --> 03:45:27.829]  That's not what I do.
[03:45:28.629 --> 03:45:31.150]  I try to find the very best products that are popular,
[03:45:32.050 --> 03:45:34.891]  Get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[03:45:34.951 --> 03:45:36.151]  That seems to be like common sense.
[03:45:36.271 --> 03:45:44.554]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[03:45:44.574 --> 03:45:51.836]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, water filtration, gravity-fed systems, because they're the very best.
[03:45:51.976 --> 03:45:56.597]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price, and so we are the biggest distributor.
[03:45:56.797 --> 03:45:59.838]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[03:46:00.678 --> 03:46:03.199]  Of 127 on that water filtration system.
[03:46:03.219 --> 03:46:05.500]  Because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:06.860]  We sold out of it.
[03:46:06.880 --> 03:46:08.000]  They didn't think we could do it.
[03:46:08.641 --> 03:46:09.241]  You responded.
[03:46:09.261 --> 03:46:10.261]  You went and did your own research.
[03:46:10.501 --> 03:46:11.642]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[03:46:12.122 --> 03:46:16.823]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze Air Filtration 4-stage ion filter.
[03:46:16.883 --> 03:46:20.465]  When it came to me 5 years ago, it said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[03:46:20.525 --> 03:46:21.205]  Leading competitors are $500, $600, $800, $1,000.
[03:46:21.565 --> 03:46:23.626]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[03:46:23.686 --> 03:46:24.846]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[03:46:24.926 --> 03:46:25.446]  I said, great!
[03:46:27.967 --> 03:46:28.447]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:46:28.487 --> 03:46:32.629]  I just bought filters for $400, $600, $700 that weren't even as good, so I knew it was a great deal.
[03:46:32.789 --> 03:46:36.711]  Now they've been able to lower the price because they've expanded how many they're having manufactured to $200.
[03:46:37.312 --> 03:46:40.953]  Ladies and gentlemen, at year-end, they're doing it again, just like they did with the water filter.
[03:46:40.973 --> 03:46:43.475]  The Alexa Pure Breeze 4-stage ion filter is now $120.
[03:46:44.155 --> 03:46:45.616]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.843 --> 03:47:24.730]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones with Owen Benjamin.
[03:47:27.473 --> 03:47:28.454]  Yeah!
[03:47:29.575 --> 03:47:30.896]  That's a hot track, the Heavy.
[03:47:31.257 --> 03:47:32.398]  The Heavy, that's a great band.
[03:47:33.078 --> 03:47:33.699]  How are you guys?
[03:47:35.356 --> 03:47:40.798]  I wanted to talk a little bit about Neil deGrasse Tyson's Me Too rape allegations.
[03:47:41.118 --> 03:47:49.382]  And I'm going to start by saying I have no idea if he's guilty or not because of a beautiful American tradition called due process.
[03:47:50.062 --> 03:47:57.144]  But he's the guy, he's one of the guys that said believe women and all this stuff.
[03:47:57.405 --> 03:48:03.067]  And the credibility of his accusation, his accusers, is infinitely higher than Kavanaugh's.
[03:48:03.087 --> 03:48:03.647]  I mean, one was
[03:48:04.591 --> 03:48:04.691]  It's
[03:48:23.193 --> 03:48:25.575]  Whether or not he's guilty or innocent, it doesn't matter.
[03:48:25.915 --> 03:48:38.423]  I think that people should be held to their own rules that they inflict on other people, because in Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky, the way these people operate is make your enemy hold their own standard but don't follow their standard.
[03:48:38.763 --> 03:48:39.944]  And that's BS.
[03:48:40.184 --> 03:48:42.826]  And my gut says he's probably a perv.
[03:48:43.186 --> 03:48:44.507]  I mean, Bill Nye is a total perv.
[03:48:45.167 --> 03:48:48.489]  Allegedly, but very, very validly allegedly.
[03:48:48.509 --> 03:48:49.610]  I don't know if that's even a word.
[03:48:50.413 --> 03:48:59.455]  But today I wanted to kind of look through some of Neil deGrasse Tyson's, just a couple of his tweets, and kind of assess what this guy's all about.
[03:48:59.915 --> 03:49:02.155]  Because I think people kind of tell you what they're all about.
[03:49:02.475 --> 03:49:07.336]  People will tell you who they are constantly, and it's our job just to kind of understand it.
[03:49:07.816 --> 03:49:16.458]  And it's interesting how leftist men, when they get a hard me too, like Neil deGrasse Tyson, it goes away really fast.
[03:49:18.097 --> 03:49:19.038]  This won't go anywhere.
[03:49:19.218 --> 03:49:19.839]  No one will care.
[03:49:19.859 --> 03:49:31.607]  And he addressed it and apologized for making someone feel uncomfortable, even though he totally slandered the woman, saying that she's basically a nutjob.
[03:49:31.867 --> 03:49:34.549]  After college, he started getting into all this weird stuff.
[03:49:34.589 --> 03:49:37.971]  It's like, well, that could easily be explained by a rape.
[03:49:39.252 --> 03:49:50.358]  But uh, so anyway, let's check out one of these tweets and we'll just kind of go from there and we'll assess this guy's character, what he stands for and what that may, how that may affect women.
[03:49:50.578 --> 03:50:03.324]  Alright, so I can't really read the, alright so, I don't know if you can zoom out a little bit on this one, but to wait in line, so basically this one says, this is Neil deGrasse Tyson, that he just had to wait in line to renew his passport
[03:50:03.979 --> 03:50:09.242]  That's allowing him to visit members of my own species across artificially conceived borders.
[03:50:09.882 --> 03:50:11.703]  Alright, so that's a tweet that he sent.
[03:50:12.123 --> 03:50:14.684]  So this guy doesn't believe in borders or boundaries.
[03:50:15.304 --> 03:50:19.646]  So, that would apply to how he feels about women!
[03:50:20.107 --> 03:50:23.008]  People that, typically, people that don't believe in boundaries.
[03:50:23.148 --> 03:50:25.169]  And they're not arbitrary lines in the sand.
[03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:27.910]  He makes it seem like they're artificially conceived.
[03:50:27.930 --> 03:50:28.711]  I don't even know what that means.
[03:50:28.751 --> 03:50:29.211]  That's bad.
[03:50:30.213 --> 03:50:32.235]  It's bad language skills there, Neil.
[03:50:32.536 --> 03:50:33.777]  Stick with the calculator, buddy.
[03:50:36.020 --> 03:50:37.422]  They're not random.
[03:50:37.682 --> 03:50:41.467]  People fought and died for those lines in the sand.
[03:50:42.392 --> 03:50:49.255]  Like the reason that there's a line in a certain part of the ground on a map is because of war treaties.
[03:50:49.355 --> 03:50:56.319]  Because people fought for every single inch they could possibly get so they could govern their own lives and not live under tyranny.
[03:50:56.859 --> 03:51:09.245]  So when he says I had to wait in line to renew a passport allowing me to visit members of my own species across artificially conceived borders, what he's saying is he feels that waiting in a line is too much of an inconvenience for him and there shouldn't be
[03:51:10.734 --> 03:51:21.140]  Borders between countries and those tip the reason that there's so many rape allegations against leftist men is because people that don't believe in boundaries don't believe in boundaries.
[03:51:21.800 --> 03:51:28.983]  So if you think that that's why we're going to see a rise in I'm not going to make any predictions.
[03:51:29.003 --> 03:51:32.405]  Anyway, give me another we're going to I'm going to show you guys another tweet.
[03:51:32.705 --> 03:51:38.088]  This one will reveal even more about old Neil Tyson.
[03:51:39.949 --> 03:51:47.577]  This one says, if there were ever a species for whom sex hurt, it surely went extinct long ago.
[03:51:47.597 --> 03:51:53.583]  Okay, men, good men, can spot
[03:51:54.602 --> 03:51:55.743]  That type of behavior.
[03:51:55.763 --> 03:51:59.845]  What he's trying to do is say something that gets him laid at a party.
[03:51:59.885 --> 03:52:10.332]  It's very similar to a guy with a guitar where he talks about whether or not, um, this is all a dream and the dreams are all, and the dream is real and life isn't real and then they're like, let's go into my room.
[03:52:11.213 --> 03:52:16.196]  When he's saying that, uh, that if sex hurt anyone, that species will go extinct.
[03:52:16.216 --> 03:52:17.957]  He's obviously forgets about the cat.
[03:52:18.778 --> 03:52:23.941]  All cats procreate on violent rape where there's even spikes
[03:52:24.864 --> 03:52:26.545]  And it's just, I don't even want to get into it.
[03:52:26.645 --> 03:52:27.885]  I know that this is a family show.
[03:52:28.485 --> 03:52:36.348]  So I don't want to describe to you in graphic detail just how brutal some of the rapes are in the animal kingdom.
[03:52:37.409 --> 03:52:45.132]  So what he's trying to do here is try to set up this whole idea that he's like, hey, baby, listen, I'm Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[03:52:45.232 --> 03:52:48.253]  I have a hyphenated last name, which is a total red flag in men.
[03:52:49.253 --> 03:52:53.815]  But if sex hurt anybody, they would have went extinct long ago.
[03:52:55.678 --> 03:52:56.278]  Come on, man.
[03:52:57.059 --> 03:52:59.881]  He's basically setting up a rape defense.
[03:53:00.721 --> 03:53:04.084]  If there were ever a species for whom sex hurt, it surely went extinct long ago.
[03:53:04.464 --> 03:53:05.385]  Tell that to cats.
[03:53:06.605 --> 03:53:07.886]  Tell that to cats, Neil.
[03:53:07.906 --> 03:53:10.108]  All right.
[03:53:10.568 --> 03:53:13.910]  Let's check out another one of this.
[03:53:14.471 --> 03:53:18.894]  On this day long ago, a child was born who, by age 30, would transform the world.
[03:53:19.254 --> 03:53:20.555]  Happy birthday, Isaac Newton.
[03:53:20.735 --> 03:53:22.816]  December 25th, 1642.
[03:53:23.717 --> 03:53:25.298]  He tweeted that, of course, on Christmas.
[03:53:26.381 --> 03:53:32.384]  Um, it's, it's one thing to not be Christian or religious.
[03:53:32.444 --> 03:53:34.085]  You can, whatever you are, you are.
[03:53:34.606 --> 03:53:39.088]  It's another thing to have like a real cynical, you want, you take cynical jabs.
[03:53:40.089 --> 03:53:46.632]  It really says a lot about somebody and a little known fact, not little known if you read books, but Isaac Newton was a devout Christian.
[03:53:47.753 --> 03:53:53.196]  So what he's trying to say here is he's trying to establish a secular religion.
[03:53:53.806 --> 03:53:54.566]  Called leftism.
[03:53:55.067 --> 03:53:55.647]  Globalism.
[03:53:56.147 --> 03:53:59.228]  And it's all based on- on- on nonsense.
[03:54:00.289 --> 03:54:08.572]  Of all the miracles of Christ, no- nothing is- is less believable than the Big Bang.
[03:54:09.292 --> 03:54:12.433]  He's saying that all- he's saying that all- okay.
[03:54:14.794 --> 03:54:17.875]  There was this quote, God is an all-ever-receding pocket of science.
[03:54:17.895 --> 03:54:19.296]  Ah, man, this guy's terrible.
[03:54:19.316 --> 03:54:20.156]  Look at that mustache.
[03:54:20.176 --> 03:54:22.297]  He's like- he's like a weird- he's like a black Zorro.
[03:54:23.672 --> 03:54:32.617]  But, so the Big Bang says that all physical laws and properties existed instantly out of nothing.
[03:54:33.097 --> 03:54:39.081]  And that matter cannot be created or destroyed, it can merely be converted from energy to matter and matter to energy.
[03:54:39.801 --> 03:54:40.802]  And where did it all come from?
[03:54:41.382 --> 03:54:41.822]  Nothing.
[03:54:42.603 --> 03:54:44.504]  And it happened randomly out of nowhere.
[03:54:46.025 --> 03:54:47.246]  And... we good?
[03:54:48.326 --> 03:54:48.546]  That's...
[03:54:50.308 --> 03:54:50.948]  There's a great C.S.
[03:54:50.989 --> 03:54:51.929]  Lewis quote.
[03:54:52.229 --> 03:54:56.792]  He said something along the lines of, science says, give me one miracle and we'll explain everything.
[03:54:58.313 --> 03:55:01.075]  Science is based on a miracle.
[03:55:02.535 --> 03:55:08.219]  And the fact that they won't acknowledge the miracle makes it extra nefarious.
[03:55:09.108 --> 03:55:15.253]  I believe in God, but I know that I require faith to do that, and I say it's faith.
[03:55:15.453 --> 03:55:15.873]  It's faith.
[03:55:15.893 --> 03:55:16.474]  I have faith.
[03:55:16.554 --> 03:55:17.414]  That's why it's called faith.
[03:55:17.875 --> 03:55:20.697]  These people will not admit that they have faith.
[03:55:21.017 --> 03:55:22.899]  They say that they're rational, right.
[03:55:22.979 --> 03:55:24.520]  It's all provable, and it's facts.
[03:55:24.920 --> 03:55:25.881]  Humans are machines.
[03:55:26.381 --> 03:55:27.302]  It's all material.
[03:55:27.742 --> 03:55:35.608]  We're just material, predetermined chemistry factories that are just playing out whatever the Big Bang wants us to.
[03:55:35.688 --> 03:55:37.630]  That's a guy who rapes.
[03:55:39.264 --> 03:55:43.146]  So, when he's just taking a jab, and by the way, he wouldn't do that on Mohammed's birthday.
[03:55:43.386 --> 03:55:44.667]  It's only against Christianity.
[03:55:44.707 --> 03:55:44.947]  Why?
[03:55:44.967 --> 03:55:46.768]  Because Christianity sets people free.
[03:55:47.188 --> 03:55:48.969]  Christianity isn't a slave religion.
[03:55:49.710 --> 03:55:54.832]  Unlike our brothers and sisters in the Middle East who are in a slave religion.
[03:55:55.793 --> 03:55:58.294]  Islam is communism with a god.
[03:55:58.594 --> 03:56:05.358]  It's designed to just say nonsense over and over again and do things just to stay in line.
[03:56:06.139 --> 03:56:06.799]  Christianity
[03:56:07.822 --> 03:56:12.063]  Doesn't punish Jews and Muslims differently than Christians in crimes.
[03:56:12.083 --> 03:56:13.583]  Do you know how revolutionary that is?
[03:56:14.003 --> 03:56:14.864]  How rare that is?
[03:56:17.884 --> 03:56:22.425]  There's different laws for non-Muslims than there is for Muslims.
[03:56:22.465 --> 03:56:26.866]  And as a non-Muslim, I find that horrifying.
[03:56:27.947 --> 03:56:29.587]  There's attacks for non-Muslims.
[03:56:29.707 --> 03:56:33.148]  So the fact that his reverence for Islam, he's never attacked Islam,
[03:56:34.280 --> 03:56:43.743]  And his disdain for Christianity is very telling, because people who like slaves, rape, because it's about control.
[03:56:44.163 --> 03:56:46.104]  Sexual predation is about control.
[03:56:46.704 --> 03:56:47.724]  Pedophilia, all of it.
[03:56:47.884 --> 03:56:49.865]  It's about control, control, control.
[03:56:49.925 --> 03:56:51.625]  It's about having power over somebody else.
[03:56:52.186 --> 03:56:59.828]  I went through a phase where I didn't believe that, where I thought that saying that rape is about power, not sex, was some weird argument, and I didn't quite understand it.
[03:56:59.848 --> 03:57:03.089]  And then the older I got, the more I realized, outside of
[03:57:04.682 --> 03:57:11.083]  Different procreation strategies and horrific times of our history.
[03:57:11.103 --> 03:57:13.904]  It is about power.
[03:57:14.524 --> 03:57:17.705]  It's about being able to inflict your will on somebody else.
[03:57:19.185 --> 03:57:21.445]  I think we might have time for one last tweet here.
[03:57:22.446 --> 03:57:24.486]  Another tweet by old Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[03:57:24.506 --> 03:57:25.846]  Check this one out, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:57:27.447 --> 03:57:28.567]  Oh, we got to go on a break.
[03:57:29.067 --> 03:57:31.327]  When we come back, more good stuff.
[03:57:31.927 --> 03:57:32.468]  More fun.
[03:57:32.748 --> 03:57:33.548]  HugePianist.com.
[03:57:35.023 --> 03:57:36.808]  YouTube.com slash Owen Benjamin comedy.
[03:57:37.350 --> 03:57:39.998]  Hildreth Ross Tyson allegedly is a full-blown rapist.
[03:57:40.820 --> 03:57:41.161]  Yeah!

[03:58:30.729 --> 03:58:37.755]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the new world order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty and trying to shut down the free press is.
