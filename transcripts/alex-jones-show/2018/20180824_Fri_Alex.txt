[00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:10.164]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:11.545]  Never!
[00:00:12.305 --> 00:00:15.487]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[00:00:15.747 --> 00:00:15.967]  No!
[00:00:16.007 --> 00:00:28.574]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:30.628]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:00:30.828 --> 00:00:39.897]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:43.861]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.231]  Babylon Mystery Religion Ceremony!
[00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:55.875]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.698]  Prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:03.301]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:07.864]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites!
[00:01:07.904 --> 00:01:13.429]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:17.212]  They falsely edited him.
[00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.302]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:28.046]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:34.309]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.312]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:42.814]  And then we get hit and say, you can no longer use our software.
[00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:46.876]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[00:01:47.376 --> 00:01:48.957]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:01:48.997 --> 00:01:49.818]  They just killed our stream.
[00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.359]  Really?
[00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.719]  Yep.
[00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.441]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:57.203]  This is America in 2018.
[00:01:57.303 --> 00:02:05.689]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[00:02:07.938 --> 00:02:09.140]  Will you do nothing?
[00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:14.125]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:21.834]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:27.761]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:55.782]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:03:00.342 --> 00:03:02.283]  You are living in epic history.
[00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:07.625]  Will you be someone that sits up there in the bleachers, or will you be the man or woman in the arena?
[00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:10.806]  I have chosen my place in the arena.
[00:03:11.406 --> 00:03:20.409]  We've seen great victories, we've seen great defeats, and now we know the enemy is truly evil as we knew they were, and now the battle is joined.
[00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.669]  74 days left.
[00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.811]  Dan Rather, the famous fake newsman, just as bad as
[00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:35.754]  Ryan Williams thinks we have no memory, and he says what Mueller knows will make Cohen Manafort pale by comparison.
[00:03:36.454 --> 00:03:44.158]  Stay tuned as Trump Organization could face criminal charges from the other swamp, the other head of the Hydra, Manhattan D.A.
[00:03:45.118 --> 00:03:58.908]  As the establishment makes its move, all the giant crimes of Hillary, all the giant crimes of Obama, all the giant crimes of the globalists, all the giant crimes of communist China killing their political dissidents and Apple and their slave factories.
[00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:00.770]  But none of it matters.
[00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:09.916]  Because Donald Trump, legally and lawfully years ago, gave some money to two women who thought he was going to marry them or whatever, at least with the case of the Playboy model.
[00:04:10.477 --> 00:04:13.499]  And then, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, it's so terrible.
[00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:17.951]  His lawyer was not paying taxes at a taxicab company.
[00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:18.712]  He's pled guilty.
[00:04:18.752 --> 00:04:20.894]  And so because of that, we can't have the recovery.
[00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:22.716]  America can't be great again.
[00:04:23.177 --> 00:04:29.243]  Because Trump isn't letting China have $900 billion of trade deficit against us every year.
[00:04:29.303 --> 00:04:30.825]  Because Trump's actually standing up for us.
[00:04:31.185 --> 00:04:32.267]  He has to be removed.
[00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:34.930]  He said, how do you take somebody out who's done a good job?
[00:04:36.448 --> 00:04:37.629]  How do you do it, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:39.770]  You do it with lies and deceit.
[00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.673]  I have now learned from people what the New York Times, Washington Post, and others are doing.
[00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:46.395]  And it is unbelievable.
[00:04:46.495 --> 00:04:49.557]  I mean, look, we know they're evil.
[00:04:50.397 --> 00:04:52.779]  We know they're trained and bred to hate this country and to hate strength.
[00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:58.203]  But let me tell you, if there's ever any doubt about how evil these folks are, we've got the proof.
[00:04:58.583 --> 00:05:00.104]  Stay with us, big transmission straight ahead.
[00:05:06.906 --> 00:05:08.327]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:09.808]  Victor, you're calling.
[00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:10.529]  Go ahead.
[00:05:10.549 --> 00:05:10.629]  Yes.
[00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:11.789]  Hi, Alex.
[00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.074]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[00:05:18.294 --> 00:05:22.277]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[00:05:22.497 --> 00:05:23.958]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[00:05:24.338 --> 00:05:33.965]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it's like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[00:05:34.846 --> 00:05:39.550]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:47.416]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[00:05:47.436 --> 00:05:53.241]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:58.685]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[00:05:58.705 --> 00:06:01.788]  And it's not a silver bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a silver bullet.
[00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:08.147]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now.
[00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:09.608]  There is no government official here.
[00:06:10.108 --> 00:06:14.052]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:25.482 --> 00:06:28.925]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:28.945 --> 00:06:30.567]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.641]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:37.362]  They came in peace.
[00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:01.143]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[00:07:01.183 --> 00:07:07.188]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:18.716 --> 00:07:19.897]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:21.258]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:23.219]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[00:07:30.425 --> 00:07:36.687]  This is CNN.
[00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.288]  ...war on corruption.
[00:07:38.788 --> 00:07:44.009]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:57.594]  Well, we're getting close to two years of El Presidente being in office, a little over a year and a half, and see the country coming back from the dead by the Crypt Keepers.
[00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:01.357]  They're not about to let the country come back.
[00:08:01.417 --> 00:08:01.937]  It's theirs.
[00:08:02.038 --> 00:08:03.118]  It belongs to them.
[00:08:03.138 --> 00:08:07.860]  And the bureaucracy and the intelligence agencies and the corrupt bureaucrats.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:18.046]  And so the swamp from DC and the swamp from New York and a double Hydra-Pencer attack are moving against the president.
[00:08:18.566 --> 00:08:20.007]  And we see the headlines.
[00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:20.567]  The Hill.
[00:08:21.127 --> 00:08:22.348]  Spiro Agnew lawyer.
[00:08:22.408 --> 00:08:26.890]  Trump should resign to keep Mueller from prosecuting his family.
[00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:28.771]  Oh, they're never going to give him any quarter.
[00:08:30.413 --> 00:08:34.494]  National Enquirer reportedly kept Trump hush money info in a safe.
[00:08:36.274 --> 00:08:41.855]  And now they've been given immunity to begin to roll on the president.
[00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:45.156]  Meanwhile, Dan Rather.
[00:08:46.316 --> 00:08:51.097]  What Mueller knows will make Cohen Manafort pale by comparison.
[00:08:51.117 --> 00:08:54.977]  What, like your fake George W. Bush Air National Guard records?
[00:08:55.037 --> 00:08:58.338]  Or maybe Brian Williams saying he got shot in a helicopter?
[00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:02.110]  Real clear politics there.
[00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:06.874]  Trump Organization can face criminal charges from Manhattan D.A.
[00:09:06.955 --> 00:09:07.475]  Yes!
[00:09:08.296 --> 00:09:11.458]  Yes, the cesspool of corruption, New York.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.545]  And now they're trying to tie that in to local government and go after the president himself.
[00:09:18.605 --> 00:09:19.886]  And why does the president have immunity?
[00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:22.168]  Except from impeachment?
[00:09:22.528 --> 00:09:23.569]  That's the other branch of government?
[00:09:25.595 --> 00:09:33.419]  He has that because any little two-bit jurisdiction would then start engaging in witch-hunt prosecutions against the political enemy.
[00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:37.241]  But I want to know why the Republicans don't ever act like this, and that's the big issue.
[00:09:39.041 --> 00:09:52.728]  Is that you have dead to rights, the Clintons, Obama, Brennan, Clapper, lying to Congress, you have Benghazi, you have the looting of Haiti, you have the illegal servers, you have the four billion dollars in the Clinton Foundation, Uranium One,
[00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:59.393]  Fast and Furious, the funding and founding of Al Qaeda and ISIS, on and on and on.
[00:10:01.374 --> 00:10:05.076]  But Jeff Sessions will not move against it.
[00:10:05.116 --> 00:10:24.165]  And that's what Trump keeps asking that we're going to cover coming up in the next segment is the way you just know there's complete, total, admitted, massive corruption.
[00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:34.826]  Obama got fined $374,000 for $84 million that wasn't accounted for right, and then millions and millions that they found that was definitely illegal.
[00:10:35.846 --> 00:10:39.307]  But oh, you get a little fine from the campaign money.
[00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:51.911]  But then, Congressman from California buys a bunch of dinners for his staff and drinks and flies his daughter and pet rabbit around with him and buys him a couple thousand dollars in video games.
[00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:54.892]  Literally, some of the charges are for cheeseburgers.
[00:10:55.796 --> 00:10:56.476]  Campaign money.
[00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:58.897]  The public's so dumb that it's Democrats.
[00:10:59.197 --> 00:10:59.717]  I see headlines.
[00:10:59.737 --> 00:11:01.158]  Well, he stole from taxpayers.
[00:11:01.478 --> 00:11:04.879]  Campaign finance money, when it's raised directly from donors, is not.
[00:11:05.099 --> 00:11:07.700]  Sure, low-level candidates get matching funds sometimes.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.260]  That's different.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.941]  So they conflate all this.
[00:11:11.021 --> 00:11:15.702]  It's just crazy to see the total and complete hypocrisy of all this.
[00:11:16.102 --> 00:11:16.863]  So know this.
[00:11:19.263 --> 00:11:21.264]  I told everybody, they're not waiting.
[00:11:23.482 --> 00:11:23.922]  For 2020.
[00:11:24.463 --> 00:11:26.003]  They're not waiting for impeachment.
[00:11:26.904 --> 00:11:38.790]  They are going to target and prosecute Don Jr., which we broke three days ago, that is now in Esquire and other publications yesterday.
[00:11:40.342 --> 00:12:03.395]  And they are going to go after everyone in his organization and find something where somebody didn't pay taxes right or the FBI interviews him and the FBI says they lied so they get indicted until enough people, namely the cabinet around Trump, get scared and agree to remove him so that they don't get indicted.
[00:12:05.205 --> 00:12:14.873]  If you looked at Brennan and Clapper and others last year, last October, they were on with Wolf Blitzer on the Aspen Institute's program.
[00:12:16.654 --> 00:12:18.536]  You've played the clip here probably a hundred times or more.
[00:12:19.056 --> 00:12:22.699]  And they said, don't worry, he'll be gone soon by December.
[00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:23.740]  That was last year.
[00:12:24.181 --> 00:12:25.522]  That was nine months ago.
[00:12:27.143 --> 00:12:27.944]  He'll be gone
[00:12:28.991 --> 00:12:29.992]  And they go, oh, impeachment?
[00:12:30.012 --> 00:12:31.913]  And they go, no, extrajudicial.
[00:12:32.513 --> 00:12:35.054]  So that doesn't even really mean 25th Amendment.
[00:12:36.035 --> 00:12:38.396]  I guess you could argue it's legislative, so it's 25th Amendment.
[00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:45.220]  Having the majority of his cabinet say, we believe he's insane.
[00:12:46.221 --> 00:12:56.467]  So this is pure mafia tactics by Mueller, by the Clintons, and all these people who themselves are in Russian companies and Chinese companies, who themselves delivered uranium on tarmacs.
[00:12:56.507 --> 00:12:56.787]  Mueller.
[00:12:57.127 --> 00:12:58.528]  The richness of this.
[00:13:03.806 --> 00:13:04.386]  Is incredible.
[00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:11.950]  It'd be like a judge having you in a jaywalking hearing and the judge comes in with their mask on and a bag of cash and says, sorry, I just robbed a bank during lunch.
[00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:14.811]  Can the bailiffs help me with the cash?
[00:13:16.852 --> 00:13:18.713]  Now we're going to put you in jail for the jaywalking.
[00:13:21.394 --> 00:13:22.675]  Trump's ring of fire.
[00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:33.598]  Trump's ring of fire, National Enquirer boss has immunity and Cohen probe.
[00:13:33.959 --> 00:13:42.587]  And that means, oh, we're going to charge you, even though this isn't illegal, and a bunch of companies and groups do this, where they catch and kill these stories.
[00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:45.711]  People come with the story, they're wanting money anyways.
[00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:47.372]  Okay, here, you want the money?
[00:13:47.392 --> 00:13:48.253]  That's a transaction.
[00:13:48.273 --> 00:13:49.454]  They're the one blackmailing you.
[00:13:50.435 --> 00:13:51.617]  Is paying blackmail illegal?
[00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:54.471]  Not if you haven't committed a crime.
[00:13:55.132 --> 00:13:57.114]  It's only illegal if you're doing it to cover up a crime.
[00:13:57.134 --> 00:14:03.580]  And that's all admitted and they've had the former, you know, heads of the Justice Department come out and say that and they don't know what Sessions is doing.
[00:14:03.961 --> 00:14:05.282]  I can tell you what Sessions is doing.
[00:14:08.345 --> 00:14:11.909]  They came in and they intimidated him and they threatened him and they did that day one.
[00:14:13.411 --> 00:14:14.472]  And he took that job.
[00:14:15.799 --> 00:14:31.153]  They need to be fired right now and so does Mueller and every one of these people down 10-15 deep and there needs to be giant prosecutions of the deep state and Trump has to move on these people or politically or they're going to go all out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:31.173 --> 00:14:32.474]  There are a lot of cowards in D.C.
[00:14:32.995 --> 00:14:34.616]  Not everybody's like Donald Trump, very few are.
[00:14:34.636 --> 00:14:36.338]  Alright, I'm going to go to break here in a moment.

[00:15:34.344 --> 00:15:36.626]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.

[00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:54.671]  That price is totally insane with the turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, and even more.

[00:16:09.983 --> 00:16:11.424]  My friends, we have done it.
[00:16:12.064 --> 00:16:18.167]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:24.289]  This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[00:16:24.589 --> 00:16:26.850]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager.
[00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.832]  Dr. Edward Group is here to test his greatest invention.
[00:16:31.032 --> 00:16:31.372]  Doctor?
[00:16:31.392 --> 00:16:32.953]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:16:33.353 --> 00:16:37.875]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:43.928]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[00:16:43.948 --> 00:16:45.750]  Thank you, Dr. Groot.
[00:16:46.711 --> 00:16:49.153]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[00:16:49.614 --> 00:16:50.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[00:16:51.556 --> 00:16:52.297]  This is the move.
[00:16:52.337 --> 00:16:53.858]  This is unprecedented.
[00:16:53.878 --> 00:16:56.601]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:57.081]  Oh my God!
[00:16:57.141 --> 00:16:58.302]  What the hell?
[00:16:58.543 --> 00:16:59.243]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[00:16:59.263 --> 00:17:00.204]  Get out of here!
[00:17:00.224 --> 00:17:00.725]  Shut this down!
[00:17:00.765 --> 00:17:01.546]  This is not safe!
[00:17:01.806 --> 00:17:02.567]  This is not safe!
[00:17:02.827 --> 00:17:03.087]  Hold on!
[00:17:03.107 --> 00:17:03.788]  Settle down!
[00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:04.809]  Get another doctor.
[00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:05.429]  Something's wrong.
[00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:06.330]  Something's wrong with him.
[00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:06.870]  Help him.
[00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:08.931]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:09.872]  I take it personally.
[00:17:10.092 --> 00:17:11.253]  Do not have those problems.
[00:17:12.674 --> 00:17:14.435]  Again, these are authorized verbs.
[00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:15.676]  Well known to be safe.
[00:17:17.056 --> 00:17:18.077]  Please, doctor.
[00:17:18.477 --> 00:17:19.318]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:22.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut the commercial for just a moment.
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:22.940]  Cut, cut, cut.
[00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.743]  Get everybody out of here.
[00:17:28.464 --> 00:17:29.685]  Super male vitality.
[00:17:30.245 --> 00:17:30.845]  It's awesome.
[00:17:31.306 --> 00:17:33.107]  Just not this awesome.
[00:17:35.526 --> 00:17:38.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[00:17:38.812 --> 00:17:44.824]  It is satire to illustrate, in a satirical way, the incredible power of super male vitality.
[00:17:45.956 --> 00:17:54.003]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[00:17:54.483 --> 00:17:58.487]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:58.507 --> 00:18:01.870]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.411]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[00:18:03.431 --> 00:18:04.352]  It takes some focus.
[00:18:05.113 --> 00:18:06.374]  Up, up, and away!
[00:18:14.046 --> 00:18:18.504]  Start your journey to super male vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:38.344]  Let's go ahead and talk to Make America Great Again, Titan!
[00:18:38.364 --> 00:18:39.485]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:18:39.645 --> 00:18:43.148]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[00:18:43.208 --> 00:18:45.930]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.573]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[00:18:48.613 --> 00:18:51.655]  Survival Shield, Mason Iodine X2, life-changing.
[00:18:51.695 --> 00:18:53.577]  Supermail Vitality, life-changing.
[00:18:53.637 --> 00:18:55.258]  Rainforce Plus, life-changing.
[00:18:55.318 --> 00:18:57.620]  Super Blue Non-Fluoride Two-Face, life-changing.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.021]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[00:18:59.041 --> 00:19:01.103]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[00:19:01.163 --> 00:19:02.824]  The hats, the t-shirts, amazing.
[00:19:03.064 --> 00:19:04.846]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:06.087]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[00:19:06.107 --> 00:19:07.888]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:09.629]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:11.431]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:12.912]  It's bankrupt sport, like I said.
[00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:15.154]  And I started working out every day.
[00:19:15.274 --> 00:19:16.655]  I lift weights every day.
[00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:18.457]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:21.419]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X to a drop of that every morning.
[00:19:21.479 --> 00:19:22.240]  I feel fantastic.
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.161]  My skin is clearing up, asterizes, so that's clearing up.
[00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:26.441]  My hair is going back thicker.
[00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.722]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[00:19:29.762 --> 00:19:31.702]  The brain force is just amazing.
[00:19:31.762 --> 00:19:33.002]  That stuff makes you think.
[00:19:33.162 --> 00:19:34.283]  It keeps you on your toes.
[00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:35.523]  The same thing with the iodine.
[00:19:35.543 --> 00:19:37.863]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[00:19:37.923 --> 00:19:39.264]  And your products are amazing.
[00:19:39.384 --> 00:19:43.785]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you, and it's just life-changing.
[00:19:43.845 --> 00:19:49.766]  And how people can go against the true resistance, they're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong side of history, and that's why we're the right.
[00:19:49.966 --> 00:19:51.467]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[00:19:51.507 --> 00:19:55.109]  And I've got to say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[00:19:55.129 --> 00:19:56.689]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[00:19:56.709 --> 00:19:57.410]  You're the real deal.
[00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.531]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[00:20:06.394 --> 00:20:08.995]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.329 --> 00:20:27.032]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[00:20:27.913 --> 00:20:29.634]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:36.561 --> 00:20:37.923]  Coming up next segment...
[00:20:39.289 --> 00:20:49.335]  From the very folks that brought us the fake PPGate dossier, BuzzFeed, tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare a 2018 election strategy.
[00:20:49.355 --> 00:20:51.076]  They've already had these meetings.
[00:20:51.697 --> 00:20:52.797]  Tim Cook runs them.
[00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:53.818]  That's even leaked.
[00:20:54.398 --> 00:20:57.440]  And it's how to censor everyone.
[00:20:58.101 --> 00:21:04.885]  They're gathering at Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco according to an email obtained by BuzzFeed News.
[00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:09.075]  This is the strategy.
[00:21:09.115 --> 00:21:14.057]  Meanwhile, Facebook censors articles from conservative news outlets about Manafort and Cohen.
[00:21:14.637 --> 00:21:16.238]  They're making their move.
[00:21:16.778 --> 00:21:18.698]  And next segment, I'm going to break that down.
[00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:23.400]  So America, they're going to try to steal this election from you in front of God and country?
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:30.422]  And then once they've done that, Obama signed an executive order that Trump hasn't rescinded, because he can't do everything.
[00:21:30.442 --> 00:21:36.044]  That's why they try to keep him isolated, to federalize all elections after this.
[00:21:37.051 --> 00:21:41.092]  And they're coming after Infowars, so we won't be a voice to the people during all of this.
[00:21:41.432 --> 00:21:43.053]  But you already know what's going on.
[00:21:43.153 --> 00:21:44.173]  You already knew what happened.
[00:21:45.834 --> 00:21:47.674]  But these are dire straits for this country.
[00:21:48.355 --> 00:21:49.955]  Now, I'm gonna give you the big secret right now.
[00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:52.636]  I'm gonna give you the big secret.
[00:21:53.916 --> 00:21:57.998]  Trump made a secret vet.
[00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:01.919]  It turns out Trump is a gambler.
[00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:03.939]  That's right.
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:05.400]  Trump has a gambling problem.
[00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:07.261]  A really bad one.
[00:22:08.382 --> 00:22:10.324]  I'm about to tell you about exclusively right now.
[00:22:12.845 --> 00:22:15.027]  You see, Trump is very, very stubborn.
[00:22:15.587 --> 00:22:21.071]  Trump is a loner when it comes to his ideas and what he stands for.
[00:22:21.091 --> 00:22:22.291]  He believes in himself.
[00:22:22.792 --> 00:22:28.916]  He listens to others, but he's an island unto himself, as many leaders are.
[00:22:31.363 --> 00:22:49.169]  And he believes in the underdog, and he believes in America, and he believes in pragmatic business, but he doesn't like seeing America, for some globalist dominance game, being put into a cultural prison, being demoralized, being made poor, being broken down.
[00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.330]  He sees it as a great asset.
[00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.232]  Just like he takes old buildings and rehabilitates them and turns them into beautiful new buildings, like his D.C.
[00:22:58.773 --> 00:22:59.853]  National Post Office.
[00:22:59.873 --> 00:23:01.234]  It's an amazing, beautiful hotel.
[00:23:02.495 --> 00:23:08.258]  Never been in a hotel with that type of beautiful architecture and the blue and the silver and the gold.
[00:23:08.338 --> 00:23:09.098]  It wasn't gaudy.
[00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:11.199]  It was very heavenly-like.
[00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.141]  Trump likes nice things.
[00:23:15.161 --> 00:23:16.342]  He likes you being happy.
[00:23:16.742 --> 00:23:17.983]  He likes seeing you successful.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.343]  But he doesn't like big globalist alpha dogs trying to run his life, or run your life.
[00:23:26.703 --> 00:23:29.605]  So he likes, like a real alpha, to take on other alphas.
[00:23:29.725 --> 00:23:30.385]  Twisted alphas.
[00:23:32.006 --> 00:23:33.227]  And so Trump made a bet.
[00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:49.597]  He knew that with the tariffs being totally one-sided for 50 years, and he knew with the demoralization of the people, and he knew with the Federal Reserve doing all it could to suppress real growth, and only giving big banks money and credit, he knew that if he could get in there and even partially right the ship, at least he thought,
[00:23:50.612 --> 00:23:54.938]  Folks would say, oh my God, no matter the attacks, no matter what happens, we want this.
[00:23:55.278 --> 00:23:57.301]  This proves we were being artificially suppressed.
[00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:05.631]  So he got in, and before he even got into office when he was president-elect, just the fact that the world knew that the whole globalist strategy
[00:24:06.704 --> 00:24:10.746]  wasn't being adopted like it had been before of shutting down America.
[00:24:11.046 --> 00:24:29.595]  The fact that America was open for business again, the fact that that was going on, the fact that that was unfolding, the fact that that was happening, meant all this investment rushed back in because until the 60s we were half the world's wealth, only 4% of the population.
[00:24:30.135 --> 00:24:31.896]  So Trump bet on America.
[00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:35.528]  He doesn't go betting at casinos that he owns.
[00:24:35.568 --> 00:24:37.449]  He doesn't go really betting on golf.
[00:24:37.509 --> 00:24:40.489]  It's well known that he's not a big wagerer.
[00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:55.372]  But when it comes to business and standing up to tyrants and buying Mar-a-Lago, where no Jews or no blacks were allowed, he thought, I'll buy this old thing that fell apart because he's a dumbass racist.
[00:24:55.432 --> 00:24:56.213]  They all died.
[00:24:56.773 --> 00:24:57.453]  And I'll fix it up.
[00:24:57.493 --> 00:24:58.453]  I'll make it open to everybody.
[00:25:00.954 --> 00:25:01.334]  And he did.
[00:25:01.414 --> 00:25:03.094]  I'll bring in black entertainers, you name it.
[00:25:05.442 --> 00:25:08.423]  And it's one of the most successful private clubs in the country.
[00:25:09.184 --> 00:25:14.105]  So, see, he bets on you because he bets on himself.
[00:25:16.546 --> 00:25:19.067]  But has Trump bet off something bigger than he can chew?
[00:25:19.467 --> 00:25:20.808]  The answer is up to you.
[00:25:20.928 --> 00:25:21.868]  What are you going to do?
[00:25:21.948 --> 00:25:22.709]  What am I going to do?
[00:25:22.969 --> 00:25:30.792]  I'm not going to abandon him when they've got the FBI and the New York Times, the Washington Post, literally trying to find ways to indict me right now.
[00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:35.340]  Even though I get threats people couldn't imagine every hour.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.081]  And I'm not whining.
[00:25:37.281 --> 00:25:37.981]  I asked for this.
[00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:41.123]  Because, gee, I'm just like Donald Trump.
[00:25:42.603 --> 00:25:42.823]  I am.
[00:25:43.003 --> 00:25:43.423]  I'm a maverick.
[00:25:44.044 --> 00:25:44.764]  I'm my own person.
[00:25:45.084 --> 00:25:47.125]  I don't like bullies and big tough guys.
[00:25:47.585 --> 00:25:48.886]  But I don't want to dominate little people.
[00:25:51.107 --> 00:25:52.527]  And I've got the sheepdog mentality.
[00:25:57.068 --> 00:26:11.056]  I see our country and our world being bullied, and I see the left creating global racism against the West, and I see all this cold-blooded garbage going on, and I see in Trump somebody who sees the world just like I do, just through real eyes, and who tries to do the best he can to have a better world for everybody.
[00:26:12.176 --> 00:26:19.040]  And I see a patriot, and I see a real man, and I just ask, is America so far gone we don't deserve it?
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.802]  That question's up to you, but this isn't the election.
[00:26:22.842 --> 00:26:24.083]  This is ten times more serious.
[00:26:24.923 --> 00:26:25.984]  This is do-or-die time.
[00:26:26.826 --> 00:26:28.068]  And the swamp from D.C.
[00:26:28.108 --> 00:26:29.249]  and New York and L.A.
[00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:30.471]  is making its move.
[00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:32.013]  And from Beijing.
[00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.397]  And from Brussels, Belgium.
[00:26:36.834 --> 00:26:38.695]  He's making his move on a real president.
[00:26:39.276 --> 00:26:41.497]  He's not perfect, but he's looking out for us.
[00:26:41.557 --> 00:26:42.698]  He believes in the stewardship.
[00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:46.720]  He believes his family name will be cemented forever above George Washington's.
[00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.063]  If he can defeat the globalists and turn America around, he is the alpha male of the planet.
[00:26:51.743 --> 00:26:52.464]  It's the challenge!
[00:26:53.204 --> 00:26:55.446]  He's got the money, he's got the women, he's got the power.
[00:26:55.686 --> 00:26:57.407]  He's not into kids like the other globalists.
[00:26:58.147 --> 00:26:59.428]  He wants to defeat the globalists.
[00:26:59.708 --> 00:27:02.530]  That's real leadership, and they know it, and it's why they're scared.
[00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:03.711]  Do we deserve that?
[00:27:06.408 --> 00:27:07.148]  I think it's up to us.
[00:27:08.409 --> 00:27:08.989]  Do we deserve it?
[00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.510]  Because you just got the real deal, folks.
[00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.191]  You just saw it.
[00:27:12.491 --> 00:27:13.831]  You saw Providence come back in.
[00:27:13.871 --> 00:27:14.492]  You saw it all.
[00:27:15.452 --> 00:27:18.654]  You're seeing the secret technologies, the cures and things being released.
[00:27:18.994 --> 00:27:19.854]  It's all about to happen.
[00:27:19.874 --> 00:27:21.535]  He's only gotten 5% done.
[00:27:21.795 --> 00:27:24.196]  If you'll just let him go all the way, it's going to be incredible.
[00:27:25.477 --> 00:27:26.417]  Planetary victory.
[00:27:28.918 --> 00:27:30.119]  I want victory for the planet.
[00:27:30.739 --> 00:27:31.199]  Close quote.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.641]  I want victory for the planet.
[00:27:35.984 --> 00:27:36.805]  Globalists don't want that.
[00:27:37.325 --> 00:27:38.006]  They hate the planet.
[00:27:38.026 --> 00:27:38.486]  They hate you.
[00:27:38.766 --> 00:27:39.427]  They think you're ugly.
[00:27:39.587 --> 00:27:40.748]  See, Trump thinks he's beautiful.
[00:27:40.768 --> 00:27:41.489]  He thinks you're beautiful.
[00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:44.191]  He doesn't like seeing America treated like this.
[00:27:44.231 --> 00:27:45.232]  He doesn't believe in that.
[00:27:46.733 --> 00:27:47.434]  Watch live.
[00:27:47.494 --> 00:27:50.296]  Trump tells Sessions to look into dim corruption.
[00:27:50.336 --> 00:27:50.957]  Here's the tweets.
[00:27:53.659 --> 00:27:54.960]  Where Trump gets into all of it.
[00:27:57.082 --> 00:27:57.963]  And breaks it all down.
[00:27:59.878 --> 00:28:07.020]  And how we've got this massive, incredible corruption in the Democratic Party that no one is doing anything about.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.520]  Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations.
[00:28:11.981 --> 00:28:12.741]  That's a close quote.
[00:28:12.841 --> 00:28:13.761]  Jeff, that's great.
[00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:15.321]  What everyone wants.
[00:28:15.921 --> 00:28:23.423]  So look into all the corruption of the other side, including deleted emails, Comey lies and leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:32.442]  FISA abuse, Christopher Steele and his phony and corrupt dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal servers of the Trump campaign, Russian collusion by Dems, and much more.
[00:28:33.643 --> 00:28:36.103]  Open up the papers and documents without redaction.
[00:28:36.203 --> 00:28:36.724]  Trump could do it.
[00:28:37.144 --> 00:28:37.764]  Come on, Jeff.
[00:28:38.384 --> 00:28:38.924]  You can do it.
[00:28:38.964 --> 00:28:39.705]  The country's waiting.
[00:28:40.525 --> 00:28:42.405]  The Russian witch hunt continues, and he goes on.
[00:28:42.746 --> 00:28:44.226]  Trump's betting on you.
[00:28:45.006 --> 00:28:45.726]  That's the secret.
[00:28:46.807 --> 00:28:48.147]  The secret casino's you.
[00:28:49.148 --> 00:28:50.048]  It's you.
[00:28:51.195 --> 00:28:53.196]  It's like in Fever Vendetta, they said, why didn't you do something earlier?
[00:28:53.216 --> 00:28:55.438]  And he says, I was waiting for you, Inspector.
[00:28:56.038 --> 00:28:56.979]  I was waiting for you.

[00:31:06.107 --> 00:31:07.428]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:31:07.908 --> 00:31:19.460]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:31:20.161 --> 00:31:25.246]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:31:26.026 --> 00:31:35.297]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:31:35.537 --> 00:31:40.183]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:31:40.683 --> 00:31:42.966]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:31:43.326 --> 00:31:44.687]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:31:45.067 --> 00:31:54.693]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:31:54.793 --> 00:31:56.954]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:31:57.474 --> 00:32:02.357]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:32:02.777 --> 00:32:06.438]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses SilverSol technology.
[00:32:06.738 --> 00:32:10.159]  There's been extensive research on SilverSol technology.
[00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:20.042]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity test.
[00:32:20.562 --> 00:32:23.984]  Study, this formula is 24 ppm.
[00:32:24.344 --> 00:32:29.306]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[00:32:29.346 --> 00:32:31.707]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[00:32:31.987 --> 00:32:36.589]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:37.249]  Ah, you don't want that.
[00:32:37.649 --> 00:32:41.452]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[00:32:41.672 --> 00:32:44.355]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[00:32:44.615 --> 00:32:47.918]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[00:32:48.298 --> 00:32:53.602]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[00:32:53.662 --> 00:32:57.806]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[00:32:58.686 --> 00:33:01.349]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[00:33:05.934 --> 00:33:12.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:34.840]  On a warm summer's eve On a train bound for nowhere I met up with a gambler We were both too tired to sleep So we took turns a-staring Out the window at the darkness
[00:33:35.748 --> 00:34:01.310]  The boredom overtook us And he began to speak He said, son, I've made a life Out of reading people's faces And knowing what the cards were By the way they held their eyes So if you don't mind my saying I can see you're out of aces For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice
[00:34:03.152 --> 00:34:29.965]  So I handed him my bottle And he drank down my last swallow Then he bombed a cigarette And asked me for a light And the night got deathly quiet And his face lost all expression Said, if you're gonna play the game, boy You gotta learn to play it right You got to know when to hold up Know when to fold up
[00:34:31.192 --> 00:34:37.575]  They'll be time enough for counting when the war is over.
[00:34:37.655 --> 00:34:39.376]  But make no mistake,
[00:34:54.452 --> 00:35:09.843]  What you're going to be counting is your children's future, you having dignity, you controlling your own life, you living in a quasi-free country with a quasi-free market system, because nothing's going to be perfect, instead of living in the nightmare globalist tyranny they're trying to set up.
[00:35:11.744 --> 00:35:22.592]  Now, if you read my letters to the President in the last month that got me banned off of major social media and major platforms,
[00:35:24.031 --> 00:35:29.313]  It's because, via other sources, that the enemy actually knows.
[00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:31.955]  So I'm not giving away any secrets here.
[00:35:32.395 --> 00:35:39.598]  Through the Pentagon, through the campaign, and there's some other ways I'm not going to mention.
[00:35:41.959 --> 00:35:47.982]  You on the campaign trail, the listeners, all of you, we've been able to get key intel to the President.
[00:35:50.383 --> 00:35:53.224]  And we got the Mike Adams report that I commissioned out to him.
[00:35:54.773 --> 00:35:59.854]  We've gotten other information to him and you now see him everywhere saying the main thing is the censorship.
[00:36:00.394 --> 00:36:08.856]  The big issue is the suppression of millions of Americans in his new tweets just yesterday and today.
[00:36:10.537 --> 00:36:15.238]  And so yes, we are talking to the president through different systems.
[00:36:15.918 --> 00:36:16.598]  And I'll leave it at that.
[00:36:17.319 --> 00:36:18.699]  And by the way, we're talking to other folks.
[00:36:20.703 --> 00:36:35.874]  And there are a lot of people right now who the establishment thinks have been scared, who don't operate through kangaroo courts and corrupt Clinton, you know, FBI people, who are really looking very, very closely at the globalists and the Democrats and all the rest of it.
[00:36:37.536 --> 00:36:48.244]  Because there was that gamble that we could bring back prosperity and really turn on the engine of America and the bet of real equality and a unification president.
[00:36:49.949 --> 00:36:54.954]  That's what patriots in our government and in some of our corporations thought.
[00:36:55.794 --> 00:37:14.251]  And that was the argument five years ago when the Pentagon, after Benghazi, and after the creation of ISIS by Obama, and after it was discovered that Obama was funding the whole Arab Spring out of Kenya and out of Cairo, Egypt,
[00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:21.252]  The decision had been made to move on the Globalist and their Chai Com funders.
[00:37:22.233 --> 00:37:26.196]  And some other folks said, no, let us draft somebody.
[00:37:26.396 --> 00:37:29.378]  We got an idea, Donald Trump, and this is documented.
[00:37:32.561 --> 00:37:39.006]  And if we can just get the country back and even negotiate with the Chinese and not have a total shutdown and just get some basic
[00:37:40.595 --> 00:37:52.065]  Concessions, we can turn the country back on, bring the country together instead of this nightmare race war plan that Hollywood and the Democrats and all the movies and all the propaganda had ready to go with.
[00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:59.111]  And so they went and found the extremely smart, extremely bullheaded,
[00:38:01.451 --> 00:38:10.754]  Very stubborn Donald John Trump and briefed him on what he already knew from his father and everything else, his own experiences in Trump, said no.
[00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:20.337]  And then Melania Trump came to him while he was cogitating for three, four months in Scotland and said, you know, what you told me is true.
[00:38:20.397 --> 00:38:20.837]  I see it.
[00:38:22.358 --> 00:38:23.218]  I think you should do this.
[00:38:23.238 --> 00:38:24.699]  And he said, well, they're going to bring up everything.
[00:38:24.739 --> 00:38:25.579]  They're going to attack you.
[00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:26.299]  They're going to do it all.
[00:38:26.779 --> 00:38:28.620]  And she said, you need to do it.
[00:38:29.755 --> 00:38:31.975]  Now, I was told that from people in the Pentagon.
[00:38:32.516 --> 00:38:33.876]  I was told that from Roger Stone.
[00:38:33.916 --> 00:38:34.756]  I was told that from others.
[00:38:35.696 --> 00:38:41.737]  Before it ever ended up in a Politico article, right after Trump got elected, it was an article, I think, how he did it, or why he did it.
[00:38:42.977 --> 00:38:46.858]  And like most of what was in the article, it's crazy to read mainstream news and finally see truth.
[00:38:48.158 --> 00:38:55.840]  Because I read that, and it was what I knew was true.
[00:38:56.946 --> 00:38:59.653]  And from conversations I've had with Trump, it's things he'd said to me.
[00:39:00.455 --> 00:39:01.297]  That is how he did it.
[00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:05.046]  And so, he just decided to go with destiny.
[00:39:05.126 --> 00:39:06.029]  It's the ultimate gamble.
[00:39:06.923 --> 00:39:07.864]  And it's very fatalistic.
[00:39:07.904 --> 00:39:08.744]  He's going to go all the way.
[00:39:08.784 --> 00:39:09.764]  He's not going to stop.
[00:39:09.804 --> 00:39:11.285]  He's not going to plea bargain.
[00:39:11.305 --> 00:39:12.226]  He's not going to back down.
[00:39:12.466 --> 00:39:14.947]  They've got news articles everywhere saying you should step down.
[00:39:15.727 --> 00:39:17.888]  You know, you should resign now or we'll destroy your family.
[00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:23.371]  Trump is being told now in national news, you resign now or we'll put your son in prison.
[00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:24.672]  We broke that three days ago.
[00:39:24.712 --> 00:39:25.572]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:39:26.012 --> 00:39:26.893]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:39:29.154 --> 00:39:30.734]  Well, Trump already canvassed his family.
[00:39:31.455 --> 00:39:32.375]  And Donald Trump Jr.
[00:39:32.415 --> 00:39:32.855]  was for it.
[00:39:32.976 --> 00:39:33.796]  Eric Trump was for it.
[00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:37.490]  His wife was for it.
[00:39:39.011 --> 00:39:39.611]  They were all for it.
[00:39:44.053 --> 00:39:45.294]  And now, there's no turning back.
[00:39:47.315 --> 00:39:50.456]  So, just like there's evil in the world, there's good in the world.
[00:39:53.357 --> 00:40:00.741]  And, you know Trump's real by the way they're attacking him, and you know he's real by the way things are getting better when he's in office.
[00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:03.782]  And I can look 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 20 moves ahead
[00:40:07.068 --> 00:40:10.369]  And if the globalists do this to Trump, I mean, the moves only get worse.
[00:40:10.909 --> 00:40:14.890]  It's like, the globalists, I've noticed, only think of step one or two.
[00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.530]  And they always lie to themselves they can fix it.
[00:40:18.211 --> 00:40:22.612]  But they go down this road, I mean, Katie barred the door.
[00:40:24.052 --> 00:40:26.613]  You know, I was going to name this segment when we put it out on the internet.
[00:40:26.993 --> 00:40:29.153]  We're live right now on radio and TV on hundreds of stations.
[00:40:29.213 --> 00:40:32.534]  I was going to name it Democrats, you know,
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.382]  Big tech caught meeting in secret to steal the election.
[00:40:37.803 --> 00:40:39.745]  But I'm going to do that next segment.
[00:40:41.206 --> 00:40:56.621]  I guess if you called this segment something, you know, the takeaway, it would be Democrats openly tell Trump, resign or we'll destroy your family.
[00:40:58.963 --> 00:40:59.344]  I mean, that's...
[00:41:01.601 --> 00:41:04.023]  That's in the Hill, that's in the Associated Press, that's everywhere.
[00:41:04.323 --> 00:41:05.184]  I mean, here are the headlines.
[00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:10.387]  Spiro Agnew lawyer, Trump should resign to keep Mueller from prosecuting his family.
[00:41:11.228 --> 00:41:13.089]  Shouldn't America be angry about that?
[00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.032]  Prosecute the family about a lie to the FBI, which isn't even proven?
[00:41:17.733 --> 00:41:19.314]  About a meeting to get dirt on Hillary?
[00:41:20.475 --> 00:41:22.936]  When they're in bed with the Russians and the Chi-Coms and everybody else?
[00:41:23.377 --> 00:41:25.939]  I mean, oh my God, you know, take care of your family!
[00:41:26.419 --> 00:41:30.582]  Sell out to us, but that sells your whole family out, and the human family out doing that.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.021]  National Enquirer boss has immunity in Cohen probe.
[00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:38.723]  That means they're going to charge them unless they make stuff up about Trump.
[00:41:40.023 --> 00:41:44.346]  Trump Organization can face criminal charges from Manhattan D.A.
[00:41:46.046 --> 00:41:48.088]  They're now giving immunity to the head of the Trump Organization.
[00:41:48.528 --> 00:41:49.668]  This is the mafia.
[00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:51.429]  I don't mean the Italian mafia.
[00:41:51.729 --> 00:41:54.991]  The Italian mafia got destroyed because it kind of challenged the real mafia.
[00:41:55.972 --> 00:41:58.253]  This is the real white shoe boy mafia.
[00:41:59.373 --> 00:42:00.314]  The Standard Oil.
[00:42:00.334 --> 00:42:02.215]  I mean, you look at Mueller.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.862]  You understand, Mueller is so rich that his wealth isn't even known.
[00:42:08.043 --> 00:42:14.567]  I mean, the heads of Standard Oil, the heads of giant railroads, all of them, all he is is a fusion of all the Robert Barrett's.
[00:42:15.448 --> 00:42:17.689]  Into him.
[00:42:17.849 --> 00:42:19.410]  Robert Mueller is them.
[00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:25.034]  I mean, I went and looked at his genealogy, I knew about this, but I spent an hour on his known genealogy yesterday.
[00:42:25.815 --> 00:42:31.659]  He literally is related to five, directly, heads of five railroads.
[00:42:33.063 --> 00:42:36.825]  Who would just out west mow down whole towns if they didn't give them what they wanted.
[00:42:36.905 --> 00:42:40.687]  I mean, he is a genetic psychopath.
[00:42:44.449 --> 00:42:45.790]  Money laundering, everything.
[00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:47.691]  Every crime you can imagine, it's him.
[00:42:48.731 --> 00:42:49.492]  Good God help us.
[00:42:50.112 --> 00:42:53.994]  Anyways, they're threatening the Trump family right now, as we first told you.
[00:42:54.034 --> 00:42:54.675]  It's all confirmed.
[00:42:54.715 --> 00:42:55.855]  How mafioso is that?
[00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:57.536]  Will America put up with this?
[00:42:57.876 --> 00:42:59.217]  The secret meeting is straight ahead.
[00:42:59.297 --> 00:43:00.338]  Infowars.com.
[00:43:00.358 --> 00:43:00.878]  Spread that link.
[00:43:02.779 --> 00:43:04.640]  Remember the old days of the internet?
[00:43:05.641 --> 00:43:08.902]  When we communicated with each other directly, email to email?
[00:43:10.203 --> 00:43:11.043]  You've got mail!
[00:43:11.644 --> 00:43:17.587]  But then Google came along and said, we've got Gmail, why it's free, but of course we read what you say and what you do.
[00:43:18.367 --> 00:43:24.251]  And then now more and more, these big globalist companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, if they don't like you, they simply ban you.
[00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:29.333]  And of course, if you're a conservative, they just list you as a Nazi.
[00:43:29.634 --> 00:43:31.895]  That's right, the entire Republican Party of California.
[00:43:32.715 --> 00:43:37.742]  Ladies and gentlemen, these platforms were useful for us to reach each other while they were still somewhat open and free.
[00:43:38.443 --> 00:43:41.927]  But the big monopoly companies only did this to consolidate the market.
[00:43:42.408 --> 00:43:47.495]  Now they're using that monopoly power, like all monopolies do, to abuse the general public.
[00:43:48.055 --> 00:43:56.419]  That's why it's more important than ever that you visit newswars.com and infowars.com themselves so the globalists can't censor you as easily.
[00:43:56.579 --> 00:43:58.119]  But just as important is email.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.180]  We need to be able to talk to you directly.
[00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:06.343]  That's why it's critical that you go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for a free newsletter.
[00:44:06.823 --> 00:44:08.124]  Also under every article
[00:44:08.504 --> 00:44:12.925]  At Infowars.com and Newswars.com, you can see the little sign-up box.
[00:44:13.185 --> 00:44:14.045]  It's absolutely free.
[00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:21.747]  And that way, no matter what happens, we can send you articles, videos, special coupon codes for the shopping cart, you name it.
[00:44:22.267 --> 00:44:37.031]  It is now absolutely essential, according to all the internet experts I talk to, that everybody start going back more and more to independent email so that we can bypass the censorship in case the globalists are able to overthrow Trump
[00:44:37.651 --> 00:44:37.971]  I think?
[00:44:54.788 --> 00:44:54.988]  Sure.
[00:45:24.648 --> 00:45:24.948]  We're good.
[00:45:39.397 --> 00:45:41.659]  We're all pulling for the same mission.
[00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:42.520]  Americana.
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.061]  Lower taxes.
[00:45:44.361 --> 00:45:45.142]  Second Amendment.
[00:45:45.362 --> 00:45:46.203]  Religious freedom.
[00:45:46.783 --> 00:45:47.724]  Family values.
[00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:48.645]  And it's happening.
[00:45:48.985 --> 00:45:51.988]  But we aren't able to communicate with each other person to person.
[00:45:52.508 --> 00:45:53.109]  Peer to peer.
[00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:57.292]  On these platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, all of it.
[00:45:57.312 --> 00:45:59.034]  More and more that's being censored.
[00:45:59.074 --> 00:46:01.096]  The shadow bands have gone to outright bands.
[00:46:02.228 --> 00:46:04.530]  And yes, we're going to try to reform these institutions.
[00:46:04.551 --> 00:46:05.552]  We're going to try to break them up.
[00:46:05.752 --> 00:46:08.635]  That's the whole process starting with congressional hearings in Congress right now.
[00:46:09.175 --> 00:46:22.829]  During this long, hard battle, it's more important than ever that patriots, Christians, nationalists, people that are populist, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, be able to communicate with each other and realize the importance of email.
[00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:28.711]  I personally get sick of email and how it gets full of spam, especially with my older email addresses.
[00:46:29.231 --> 00:46:34.733]  That's why, with Friends and Family, I have private email that only Friends and Family have.
[00:46:35.753 --> 00:46:46.275]  I again suggest that everybody go to mfulwars.com, Ford's last newsletter, and sign up for the free newsletter so we can send you direct videos, direct articles, and bypass the system.
[00:46:46.395 --> 00:46:52.917]  And yes, send you special coupon codes and other deals that are the very best we offer from mfulwarsstore.com.
[00:46:53.497 --> 00:46:56.039]  Again, my friends, thank you for joining us in the InfoWar.
[00:46:56.059 --> 00:46:57.320]  We're winning thanks to you.
[00:46:57.380 --> 00:46:57.800]  God bless.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.782]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.404 --> 00:47:21.786]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us.
[00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:24.728]  We have some just incredibly
[00:47:40.017 --> 00:47:40.437]  Important
[00:47:55.615 --> 00:47:59.277]  Two weeks ago, is because they're getting ready to steal the 2018 election.
[00:47:59.838 --> 00:48:11.145]  Now I've known, it's even come out in the New York Times, that Tim Cook has Sunday meetings with the other heads of big tech companies over the phone to try to coordinate their monopolistic cartel.
[00:48:13.167 --> 00:48:15.808]  And back in the old days, they broke up oil companies for being cartels.
[00:48:17.329 --> 00:48:18.410]  That's illegal in this country.
[00:48:22.773 --> 00:48:23.934]  But now from BuzzFeed,
[00:48:25.145 --> 00:48:27.927]  Who again is the establishment mouthpiece so they get these little tidbits.
[00:48:28.528 --> 00:48:34.813]  Tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare for the 2018 election strategy.
[00:48:35.253 --> 00:48:36.374]  Now this came out this morning.
[00:48:36.414 --> 00:48:44.200]  They're meeting currently on Friday as we speak.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.262]  And what have I pointed out to the President?
[00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:50.465]  It's collusion by big tech.
[00:48:50.605 --> 00:48:51.707]  And what else did I point out?
[00:48:51.827 --> 00:48:59.378]  How insane it is that even though it violates the Sherman Antitrust Act, even though it's racketeering, they admit in Media Matters' own documents
[00:49:00.492 --> 00:49:17.166]  That Media Matters, funded mainly by George Soros, meets with the heads of tech and has interfaces into everything you do on YouTube, Google, iPhone, everything, and tracks and traces, and then reads your private messages, and then controls what you say and what you do.
[00:49:17.726 --> 00:49:23.431]  Their job is, quote, suppressing and shutting down Fox News, conservatives, Infowars, everybody.
[00:49:24.391 --> 00:49:25.472]  This is organized crime.
[00:49:26.293 --> 00:49:28.455]  But they believe they control the Justice Department.
[00:49:30.134 --> 00:49:31.736]  And so they believe they're protected.
[00:49:32.797 --> 00:49:34.299]  And Trump is up against this cabal.
[00:49:34.379 --> 00:49:35.941]  So here's the huge news.
[00:49:42.348 --> 00:49:43.850]  Here is the ultimate news.
[00:49:44.451 --> 00:49:50.198]  The Democrats and the globalists and the offshore banks and others that fund them are so incredibly arrogant.
[00:49:51.459 --> 00:50:00.581]  That they can have three Democrat top senators call for all conservatives to be banned after I was banned, and call for the end of the First Amendment, and sell it like it's a great idea.
[00:50:01.521 --> 00:50:06.942]  And then they can meet in collusion to have 25 plus companies ban us in one day, two weeks ago.
[00:50:08.483 --> 00:50:11.043]  Clear market collusion, you name it.
[00:50:11.083 --> 00:50:13.844]  I have my top law firm's own analysis of it.
[00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:15.144]  Open and shut illegal.
[00:50:15.844 --> 00:50:18.005]  And then now, they even tell their pet
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:35.950]  Fake Russia dossier publication, BuzzFeed, that they're meeting in secret as we speak to decide to coordinate how to censor everybody because they got to do it across platforms to be successful.
[00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:38.952]  The real threat isn't Russia.
[00:50:39.212 --> 00:50:45.556]  It's China and it's the big tech companies who've colluded with China who are doing this openly like you're a bunch of idiots.
[00:50:46.257 --> 00:50:46.697]  Look at this.
[00:50:49.252 --> 00:50:52.378]  Representatives from a host of the biggest U.S.
[00:50:52.418 --> 00:51:00.874]  tech companies, including Facebook and Twitter, have reached a private meeting and have scheduled it for Friday to share
[00:51:05.956 --> 00:51:11.201]  Their tactics in preparation for the 2018 midterm elections.
[00:51:11.561 --> 00:51:13.543]  So they're just hiding it in plain view, the collusion.
[00:51:14.123 --> 00:51:31.119]  Last week, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gletcher, invited employees from a dozen companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Snapchat, all the ones that banned us, to gather at Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco, according to an email obtained by Buzzkill News.
[00:51:32.483 --> 00:51:33.103]  That's BuzzFeed.
[00:51:33.463 --> 00:51:59.537]  As I've mentioned to several of you over the last few weeks, we have been looking to scheduling a fellow and a follow-up discussion to our industry conversation about information operations, information operations, that's against America, election protection, that means letting the globalists stay in power, stealing the election, and the work we are all doing to tackle these challenges, he wrote.
[00:51:59.617 --> 00:52:01.137]  You know, I'm gonna stop right there because
[00:52:02.892 --> 00:52:03.713]  We've got a guest coming up.
[00:52:03.773 --> 00:52:04.553]  I'm going to cancel them.
[00:52:04.573 --> 00:52:07.616]  This is too important because I'm going to do this without graphics or anything when I come back.
[00:52:07.656 --> 00:52:12.540]  I'm going to do this in a focused way here on air because this is the biggest thing ever to hit this country.
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.884]  And so we'll have to move the South African farmers to a little bit later.
[00:52:17.924 --> 00:52:18.825]  If they can't make it, that's fine.
[00:52:20.067 --> 00:52:22.550]  And all the rest of it's coming up, so that's just the way it is.
[00:52:23.031 --> 00:52:28.497]  Because I'm gonna have a focused broadcast here, on air, with these subjects covered, or I'm gonna not do the show.
[00:52:29.138 --> 00:52:29.819]  That's just how it works.
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:37.567]  Because everybody's in a punch-drunk situation in this country, not realizing what we're facing, or what we're dealing with, or where we've gotten to.
[00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:39.670]  It's that simple.
[00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:47.742]  I mean, you've got big tech, all the companies together is like five trillion dollars.
[00:52:48.502 --> 00:52:55.183]  The ones that banned me the first day were 2.4, the next day another trillion, so 3.3 trillion, 3.4 trillion.
[00:52:56.023 --> 00:53:05.165]  And these are total monopolies out of control, spying on you, shelling your data, stealing elections, and Congress is sitting there drooling like they've been given lobotomies.
[00:53:07.085 --> 00:53:11.746]  And they've got all these corrupt organizations and groups trying to indict the president.
[00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:29.713]  And his family, when they've got corruption a trillion times worse than even what they claim and it's insane and the average leftist is all charred up and charged up and ready for war against you and your family because they're losers and their whole identity is about controlling you and your family.
[00:53:30.754 --> 00:53:31.815]  So, I'm gonna explain this again.
[00:53:32.496 --> 00:53:39.182]  Big tech companies are meeting in secret right now.
[00:53:43.735 --> 00:53:48.642]  And they admit they're planning to steal the election.
[00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:50.825]  And you say, why are they so?
[00:53:50.845 --> 00:53:52.848]  Because it's a hidden and plain view.
[00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:56.345]  They know we got reports of the President.
[00:53:56.425 --> 00:53:57.466]  They know he's aware of this.
[00:53:57.526 --> 00:53:58.686]  They know he was making comments.
[00:53:58.987 --> 00:53:59.967]  They know he's involved.
[00:54:00.448 --> 00:54:03.469]  They know, for whatever reason, Twitter didn't go along.
[00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:06.712]  So they think maybe Dorsey's really talking to the President.
[00:54:06.972 --> 00:54:13.436]  So they all then want to come meet with them, all the folks that have already banned me, and that means you, in secret.
[00:54:13.616 --> 00:54:15.077]  This isn't Netflix dramas.
[00:54:15.317 --> 00:54:16.618]  This isn't Netflix movies.
[00:54:16.818 --> 00:54:18.259]  This isn't some James Bond movie.
[00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:20.240]  This is the real world, people!
[00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:21.481]  It's the real one!
[00:54:23.447 --> 00:54:28.310]  Or a Nazi collaborator that's overthrown countless countries thinks he's better than you, George Soros.
[00:54:29.691 --> 00:54:30.532]  And thinks he's got you.
[00:54:34.474 --> 00:54:39.617]  So... I'll come back next hour.
[00:54:40.858 --> 00:54:43.480]  And I'll do my best to raise the alarm here as best as I can.
[00:54:44.401 --> 00:54:47.943]  And I'm gonna straight shoot you on this, but I'm explaining again, I'm not that important.
[00:54:49.898 --> 00:54:52.540]  Hillary thought I was weak because they could take me out of context.
[00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:57.465]  They ran $18 million of ads against Trump with using me, and their own studies showed it.
[00:54:57.505 --> 00:55:00.287]  Maybe we'll vote more for Trump because they wanted something avant-garde.
[00:55:00.768 --> 00:55:04.891]  Then they went, oh my God, we built Jones up, which they didn't really build me up that big, only in their own minds.
[00:55:05.672 --> 00:55:07.034]  It's all niche audiences anyways.
[00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:14.164]  So then they built me up even bigger and now they've built me up where I'm as big as Trump in most of these.
[00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:17.608]  I mean we're talking thousands of articles a day and I don't want to be as big as Trump.
[00:55:17.889 --> 00:55:18.770]  He's in the crucible.
[00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.055]  He's in the crosshairs and now they believe I'm like Godzilla attacking Tokyo.
[00:55:23.656 --> 00:55:36.489]  And then now it's gone into total cuckoo land, because it's their existential hatred of America, and of alpha male, and of chivalry, and of being honest, and of being decent, and they don't know what to do.
[00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:43.537]  So they think if they can destroy me, somehow they can kill the spirit of America, but I'm only a manifestation of that.
[00:55:45.609 --> 00:55:52.194]  And I describe mainstream media that no one watches like a burning wrecked car that rebels use to drive into a castle wall.
[00:55:52.674 --> 00:55:54.836]  I mean, none of it makes sense what they're doing.
[00:55:54.896 --> 00:55:56.977]  It's all just existential.
[00:55:57.037 --> 00:56:00.960]  They think they're dying because their only identity is squatting on America.
[00:56:03.083 --> 00:56:07.006]  And I've got a bunch of guests coming up about that, so we're going to cover it all in the next hour.
[00:56:07.026 --> 00:56:13.192]  But their meeting in secret about how they're going to collude, they're already censoring massively, it's how to respond to the President.
[00:56:13.732 --> 00:56:17.355]  And is he awake and what's going on and how can he strike back and what are they going to do?
[00:56:17.956 --> 00:56:24.822]  Because they've been threatened by Senator Warner and others that you'll destroy Trump or when we take over we will nationalize you.
[00:56:25.022 --> 00:56:25.542]  He said that.
[00:56:25.802 --> 00:56:28.204]  So they rolled over because Trump wouldn't threaten them.
[00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:33.126]  They were being threatened by the Chi-Coms and Warner and Hollywood, so they rolled over.
[00:56:33.146 --> 00:56:35.447]  Now Trump woke up, so they're saying, what do we do?
[00:56:35.707 --> 00:56:36.887]  Who do we roll over to?
[00:56:37.188 --> 00:56:38.148]  We need leadership.
[00:56:38.268 --> 00:56:39.428]  Roll over to free speech.
[00:56:39.728 --> 00:56:41.309]  Roll over to an Internet Bill of Rights.
[00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:43.169]  Roll over to not being influenced.
[00:56:43.369 --> 00:56:44.910]  And unless it's illegal, let it be.
[00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:47.150]  That's what you roll over to, Twitter.
[00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:48.511]  And Google.
[00:56:49.731 --> 00:56:55.253]  But you're a bunch of punk-asses that want to keep your $50 billion apiece, so you can all candy-ass around.
[00:56:55.813 --> 00:56:58.494]  It was the freedom that gave you all the wealth, speaking of that.
[00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:01.911]  The enemy wants to cut our funding off to destroy us.
[00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:03.931]  We've got huge sales at infowarestore.com.
[00:57:03.952 --> 00:57:10.674]  We've got ultimate bone broth formula that is beyond any way, beyond any protein, beyond anything.
[00:57:10.714 --> 00:57:16.636]  The essence of the bones, the organic chicken bones, and then a bunch of other amazing products at high level.
[00:57:16.716 --> 00:57:18.457]  Turmeric root, you know how great that is.
[00:57:18.857 --> 00:57:20.357]  Chaga mushroom, amazing.
[00:57:20.417 --> 00:57:21.438]  Bee pollen, incredible.
[00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:24.699]  Goji berry, alfalfa, herb powder over the top, and even more.
[00:57:25.099 --> 00:57:25.359]  And it's $19.95.
[00:57:25.679 --> 00:57:27.680]  That's about almost what it costs.
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.082]  But the point is, is that I want you to try it and see how amazing it is.
[00:57:31.142 --> 00:57:32.824]  Mix it with your smoothies, spirulina, you name it.
[00:57:33.164 --> 00:57:34.165]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:34.185 --> 00:57:36.086]  $19.95 for a limited time.
[00:57:36.126 --> 00:57:37.987]  We've got Ultimate Female Force, our newest product.
[00:57:38.328 --> 00:57:40.910]  The female version of Alpha Power for Men.
[00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:43.932]  There's no reviews yet for Ultimate Bone Brow that just came out this week.
[00:57:44.292 --> 00:57:46.914]  But the old version of it had thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:57:47.215 --> 00:57:48.656]  If you don't fund us, we'll be shut down.
[00:57:48.696 --> 00:57:50.417]  If you fund us, we go to the next level.
[00:57:50.617 --> 00:57:51.037]  Thank you all.
[00:57:51.078 --> 00:57:51.438]  We'll be back.

[00:58:52.219 --> 00:58:54.200]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:58:54.281 --> 00:58:54.621]  Go ahead.
[00:58:54.901 --> 00:58:57.103]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:58:57.123 --> 00:59:00.125]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:59:00.985 --> 00:59:02.066]  It just gets old, man.
[00:59:02.426 --> 00:59:04.148]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:59:04.848 --> 00:59:06.910]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:11.153]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:59:11.173 --> 00:59:12.434]  Do you understand?
[00:59:12.454 --> 00:59:13.595]  I'm ringing the alarm.
[00:59:14.475 --> 00:59:16.796]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:59:17.156 --> 00:59:18.216]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:59:18.516 --> 00:59:19.397]  Us being shut down?
[00:59:19.617 --> 00:59:20.677]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:59:21.097 --> 00:59:22.138]  You know what, Alex?
[00:59:22.178 --> 00:59:23.258]  Put him on pause again.
[00:59:23.278 --> 00:59:24.098]  Hey, Frank!
[00:59:24.398 --> 00:59:29.720]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.322]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:59:34.562 --> 00:59:37.423]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:59:37.703 --> 00:59:38.083]  You understand?
[00:59:38.163 --> 00:59:39.423]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:59:39.803 --> 00:59:40.924]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:59:41.924 --> 00:59:46.846]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:59:47.806 --> 00:59:48.487]  Do you understand?
[00:59:48.507 --> 00:59:49.807]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:59:56.610 --> 01:00:00.511]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:14.955 --> 01:00:18.664]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:00:19.005 --> 01:00:23.214]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:25.149 --> 01:00:27.110]  Okay, coming up, I'm going to lay it all out.
[01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:34.493]  Tech giants are meeting right now in secret, in their own emails, about how to carry out information warfare against you and your families.
[01:00:35.173 --> 01:00:40.375]  And they're so criminal, they're so committed, they're so out of control, they even admit they're doing it.
[01:00:40.495 --> 01:00:41.756]  I mean, it is just amazing.
[01:00:41.796 --> 01:00:42.876]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:49.719]  Then I'm going to have a leader of a major group of the Afrikaners who are being exterminated and having their land taken by the communists.
[01:00:50.539 --> 01:00:53.480]  That is all coming up at about 15 after.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:59.042]  But first, let's go ahead and go to this report on Tucker Carlson defending the First Amendment.
[01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:07.385]  As you probably heard, recently many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:01:07.425 --> 01:01:14.408]  Because it looks like his website, InfoWars, just lost their war on info yesterday.
[01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:16.852]  Yep.
[01:01:17.012 --> 01:01:27.236]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones' accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[01:01:27.276 --> 01:01:30.717]  Well, it's easy to dismiss concerns about big tech's actions.
[01:01:31.217 --> 01:01:37.819]  All coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[01:01:37.859 --> 01:01:43.021]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:01:43.141 --> 01:01:43.921]  Alex Jones.
[01:01:44.141 --> 01:01:45.162]  Alex Jones.
[01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:50.125]  At the time, we did not receive reports that we felt we could take any action that violated our terms of service.
[01:02:11.843 --> 01:02:13.725]  CNN pointed out a number of them.
[01:02:14.186 --> 01:02:23.079]  We took action on one and then we noticed that all the others, likely because they were made known to Alex Jones and Infowars, were being deleted.
[01:02:23.159 --> 01:02:25.322]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:02:26.163 --> 01:02:27.565]  This is about freedom.
[01:02:28.206 --> 01:02:33.588]  And our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[01:02:33.748 --> 01:02:37.750]  The left, which seeks to crush anything it can't control, applauded the news.
[01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:39.590]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[01:02:39.951 --> 01:02:41.511]  I think the things he says are awful.
[01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:42.692]  He makes me physically sick.
[01:02:42.732 --> 01:02:51.275]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people that listen to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[01:02:51.295 --> 01:02:53.916]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be excluded.
[01:02:54.076 --> 01:02:58.299]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[01:02:58.419 --> 01:03:00.901]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[01:03:00.961 --> 01:03:04.624]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[01:03:04.904 --> 01:03:07.366]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[01:03:07.506 --> 01:03:16.713]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[01:03:16.733 --> 01:03:16.853]  So,
[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:20.831]  They're gone.
[01:03:21.271 --> 01:03:21.872]  They're out of there.
[01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:32.225]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?
[01:03:32.485 --> 01:03:37.932]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:03:38.012 --> 01:03:40.253]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure.
[01:03:40.273 --> 01:03:45.696]  Virtually every day, the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:52.800]  Facebook censored our free speech, and shame on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:04:02.625]  Alex Jones, who is not my friend, and who tells crazy lies about me, is thrown off Twitter, I think, and Facebook, and a few other platforms.
[01:04:02.825 --> 01:04:03.766]  I think he's gonna quit.
[01:04:07.606 --> 01:04:10.548]  Well, if you're a liberal, you're supposed to be for free speech.
[01:04:10.608 --> 01:04:12.629]  That's free speech for the speech you hate.
[01:04:12.969 --> 01:04:14.390]  That's what free speech means.
[01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:20.253]  Our establishment crushes dissent not because our establishment is strong, but because it is weak and afraid.
[01:04:20.373 --> 01:04:24.855]  They're the ones in control, and they're the ultimate censors at universities, the media, everywhere.
[01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:25.616]  They're monsters.
[01:04:26.176 --> 01:04:30.318]  And now they want you completely banned from all new forms of digital communication.
[01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:33.540]  Elites aren't afraid of what Alex Jones says, Krueger writes.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.601]  They're terrified that it's popular.
[01:04:36.061 --> 01:04:38.102]  Trump didn't divide American society.
[01:04:38.222 --> 01:04:43.044]  Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and, by the way, justified distrust in institutions.
[01:04:43.745 --> 01:04:44.405]  Elites did that.
[01:04:44.685 --> 01:04:50.128]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo.
[01:04:50.288 --> 01:04:51.548]  People know what's true.
[01:04:51.809 --> 01:04:52.629]  They can smell it.
[01:04:53.049 --> 01:04:54.550]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:58.192]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:06.960]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.184]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.

[01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:19.805]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:36.162]  So, the arrogant New York Times, the narcissistic, psychotic CNN, the mentally ill, America-hating MSNBC, they all had a plan.
[01:06:36.182 --> 01:06:42.768]  Hillary, they said, the New York Times, according to their special algorithm, had a 98% chance of winning until Election Day.
[01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:45.553]  And now, America's coming back.
[01:06:45.893 --> 01:06:46.934]  The economy's coming back.
[01:06:46.974 --> 01:06:58.825]  The one-sidedness of globalism and fraudulent trade deals selling off American power has become clear that America in the 1960s was 4% of the world's population.
[01:06:58.845 --> 01:06:59.946]  96% lived outside our borders.
[01:07:01.908 --> 01:07:06.953]  And we had over half the wealth, about 55% of it, because we had the only big middle class in the world.
[01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:12.156]  And the globalists said, we'll parlay that into a new corporate empire.
[01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:29.700]  We, with tariffs and other systems, will slowly shut down America, transfer the power to authoritarian dictatorships, become fabulously rich, and then finally America, when we give them the terms of surrender, won't even know who they are, and we'll conquer them in the end.
[01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:36.911]  But along came Infowars, along came Matt Drudge, along came Donald Trump, along you came.
[01:07:37.591 --> 01:07:39.231]  And things didn't go the way they wanted.
[01:07:39.251 --> 01:07:45.032]  I'm about to cover the most insanely transparent, disgusting evil you've ever seen.
[01:07:46.172 --> 01:08:00.735]  What does Senator Warner and Senator Wyden and Senator Murphy, what do they do when they're in these different meetings and when they put out these press releases saying, we want Alex Jones shut down.
[01:08:01.857 --> 01:08:03.859]  We want Trump shut down.
[01:08:03.939 --> 01:08:05.361]  They're Russian agents.
[01:08:06.422 --> 01:08:09.104]  No judge, no jury, no indictment, no proof.
[01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:11.787]  They're the ones giving the uranium to the Russians.
[01:08:11.807 --> 01:08:13.248]  They're the ones that are anti-American.
[01:08:13.509 --> 01:08:16.892]  They're the ones in the Democratic Party that say, America was never great.
[01:08:17.192 --> 01:08:19.154]  America was never great.
[01:08:19.855 --> 01:08:21.857]  And America will never be great.
[01:08:22.998 --> 01:08:24.379]  I am Cuomo.
[01:08:24.519 --> 01:08:24.900]  I said so.
[01:08:28.473 --> 01:08:33.057]  But they look at us that bleed red, white, and blue and tell us we're the enemy because they're the globalists.
[01:08:33.077 --> 01:08:34.179]  So what's really going on here?
[01:08:34.619 --> 01:08:37.021]  Here's a Zero Hedge article from two years ago.
[01:08:38.863 --> 01:08:50.354]  Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act of the law, an executive order, hundreds of millions of dollars to have the CIA basically run the Board of Governors of the FCC.
[01:08:51.567 --> 01:08:58.474]  Not the FCC board, but the Board of Governors, and to declare independent media, nationalist media as Russian, to be shut down.
[01:08:59.014 --> 01:08:59.835]  That's federal law.
[01:09:00.155 --> 01:09:05.060]  Trump needs to sign an executive order blocking that, and we're advising him of that right now.
[01:09:05.781 --> 01:09:06.582]  Then it continues.
[01:09:08.103 --> 01:09:09.383]  Trump slams censorship.
[01:09:09.463 --> 01:09:16.165]  Social media giants are silencing millions of people after he said it was wrong that I was banned and that CNN's the real fake news.
[01:09:16.205 --> 01:09:22.366]  And who should watch is those that claim they're the gatekeeper or the judge, jury, and executioner over that.
[01:09:22.806 --> 01:09:24.766]  Social media giants are silencing millions of people.
[01:09:25.226 --> 01:09:30.907]  Can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear fake news like CNN, who says he's trying to shut them down.
[01:09:30.947 --> 01:09:33.608]  No, they lobbied to have us shut down and others shut down.
[01:09:34.687 --> 01:09:36.148]  Whose ratings have suffered gravely.
[01:09:36.469 --> 01:09:39.892]  People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship.
[01:09:41.754 --> 01:09:43.215]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:43.275 --> 01:09:47.239]  People tune in every once in a while to see what's happening, but in general, no one watches this.
[01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:50.863]  The articles on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:09:50.883 --> 01:09:54.126]  Now that takes us to the big enchilada right now.
[01:09:58.254 --> 01:10:01.635]  This is out of BuzzFeed, the little lapdog of the establishment, the fake news kings.
[01:10:01.655 --> 01:10:04.795]  I mean, in the whole world of fake news, they are the cutting edge.
[01:10:04.835 --> 01:10:05.716]  They are the vanguard.
[01:10:06.716 --> 01:10:11.337]  Tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare a 2018 election strategy.
[01:10:12.577 --> 01:10:22.799]  They're meeting this Friday at Twitter headquarters in S-hole City, San Francisco, with the feces lying in the streets and the heroin addicts everywhere.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.900]  They are meeting there in their heaven.
[01:10:27.065 --> 01:10:31.781]  And they're admittedly in the article saying, we've got Russians hitting us.
[01:10:32.691 --> 01:10:34.252]  And they list the Democrats saying it.
[01:10:34.693 --> 01:10:37.395]  Show, we've got to work to stop the Russians!
[01:10:37.715 --> 01:10:38.215]  Wink, wink.
[01:10:38.856 --> 01:10:47.803]  And that means anybody promoting Trump, anybody promoting our military, anybody promoting the Second Amendment, and they go through it saying, we haven't really had meetings before, which they've all been colluding.
[01:10:47.983 --> 01:10:50.405]  So they're now just going, oh my god, we got caught colluding.
[01:10:50.685 --> 01:10:53.408]  Trump's after us for Sherman Antitrust stuff.
[01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:54.609]  It's all coming out.
[01:10:54.629 --> 01:10:55.009]  We did this.
[01:10:55.529 --> 01:10:56.710]  Jones has got them all the documents.
[01:10:57.071 --> 01:10:57.871]  Jones's law firms.
[01:10:57.911 --> 01:10:58.292]  What do we do?
[01:10:58.732 --> 01:11:00.694]  We'll just have a big meeting and say it's our first meeting.
[01:11:01.394 --> 01:11:04.936]  So, all of this is just complete disinformation.
[01:11:04.976 --> 01:11:10.279]  Tim Cook, every Sunday, they leaked this years ago, even in the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:16.023]  And he kind of holds court over Google and Facebook and all the rest of them.
[01:11:17.464 --> 01:11:20.065]  And so Twitter, you know, is the holdout on Erasing Alex Jones.
[01:11:20.105 --> 01:11:21.706]  So, oh, they get the big meeting.
[01:11:23.427 --> 01:11:24.268]  The whole thing's scripted.
[01:11:25.008 --> 01:11:25.909]  And it goes over it.
[01:11:26.957 --> 01:11:31.099]  With all these big groups colluding, deciding how to protect the election.
[01:11:31.439 --> 01:11:34.601]  That means how to make sure the Democrats get in, which they've already been doing.
[01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:52.049]  They're banning... I've got hundreds and hundreds of articles a day, I can't even track, of just every libertarian, every conservative, every Christian group, Pat Buchanan, Gavin McGannish, Prager University, Matt Drudge being shadow banned on Twitter, where none of his tweets would go through.
[01:11:52.069 --> 01:11:53.069]  That was six months ago.
[01:11:53.589 --> 01:11:54.490]  It's everywhere!
[01:11:56.803 --> 01:11:58.384]  But again, we're all Rooskies.
[01:11:58.944 --> 01:12:03.145]  Facebook censors articles from conservative outlets about Manafort and Cohen.
[01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:09.167]  Mainline sites from the New York Post are now being blocked.
[01:12:10.448 --> 01:12:14.169]  The Washington Times is now being blocked.
[01:12:15.349 --> 01:12:16.810]  Everything's being blocked.
[01:12:17.961 --> 01:12:20.363]  Because we're not allowed to have a voice, because this is the coup.
[01:12:20.763 --> 01:12:21.884]  This is the digital coup.
[01:12:22.164 --> 01:12:22.945]  So here's the article.
[01:12:23.025 --> 01:12:24.406]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:12:24.767 --> 01:12:27.209]  Tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting.
[01:12:27.529 --> 01:12:28.950]  Remember, I talk about secret meetings.
[01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.812]  Bilderberg, oh, no corporations meet in secret.
[01:12:31.853 --> 01:12:32.533]  That's illegal.
[01:12:32.853 --> 01:12:35.115]  That violates the Sherman Antitrust Act 1906.
[01:12:35.716 --> 01:12:37.597]  Teddy Roosevelt, the Rough Riders, why?
[01:12:38.798 --> 01:12:42.842]  But see, now it's, oh, BuzzFeed tells you, but it's no big deal.
[01:12:43.974 --> 01:12:51.324]  Yeah, you know, BuzzFeed and Salon promote sex with children and stuff, but that's okay too.
[01:12:51.344 --> 01:12:52.185]  So does HBO.
[01:12:52.546 --> 01:12:55.290]  It's kind of the same thing, like, yeah, there's a secret meeting.
[01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:57.272]  Yeah, it's all the big companies.
[01:12:57.312 --> 01:12:58.454]  Yeah, they're talking about...
[01:12:59.338 --> 01:13:03.959]  How to work on the election, because they're all scared because Trump says he may move against them.
[01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:15.161]  He's already gone with the Fair Housing Act against Facebook that tracks what race you are, what your sexual proclivity is, all this stuff, to then decide what to pitch you and how much to charge you.
[01:13:15.961 --> 01:13:26.463]  But Trump needs to do a lot more with executive orders, you name it, because the fight to steal the election from the president is now, and the fight to steal it from you is now.
[01:13:29.076 --> 01:13:31.378]  Representatives from a host of the biggest U.S.
[01:13:31.418 --> 01:13:43.826]  tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, have scheduled a private meeting for Friday to share their tactics in preparation, which they've already done, two and a half months, 74, 73 days out.
[01:13:44.307 --> 01:13:45.548]  Now, it gets really telling around here.
[01:13:45.808 --> 01:13:48.630]  Last week, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel
[01:13:49.430 --> 01:14:02.322]  Gleasher invited employees from a dozen companies including Google, Microsoft, Snapchat to gather at Twitter's headquarters in downtown San Francisco according to an email obtained by BuzzFeed.
[01:14:04.614 --> 01:14:12.343]  As I've mentioned to several of you over the last few weeks, we have been looking to schedule a follow-on discussion.
[01:14:12.783 --> 01:14:14.125]  Oh, they already had a follow-up?
[01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:14.665]  They had one before?
[01:14:15.266 --> 01:14:16.467]  Because later they say it's the first.
[01:14:16.968 --> 01:14:20.212]  To our industry conversation about information operation.
[01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:21.813]  Information warfare.
[01:14:21.853 --> 01:14:22.973]  That's the... Oh!
[01:14:24.854 --> 01:14:25.995]  Election protection.
[01:14:26.155 --> 01:14:27.476]  Oh, that means give it to the Democrats.
[01:14:27.836 --> 01:14:29.577]  Letting Hillary get the questions beforehand.
[01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:31.017]  Saying she won in all the polls.
[01:14:31.478 --> 01:14:34.759]  And the work we are all doing to tackle these challenges.
[01:14:34.799 --> 01:14:39.962]  That means the American, the bitter clinger, the gun owner, the Christian, their food, the alpha male.
[01:14:40.783 --> 01:14:41.183]  They wrote.
[01:14:41.783 --> 01:14:45.025]  The meeting, the Facebook official wrote, will have a three-part agenda.
[01:14:45.718 --> 01:14:51.342]  Each company will present the work they've been doing to counter the American people with information operations.
[01:14:51.743 --> 01:14:58.068]  There will be a discussion period for problems each company faces and tactics they've learned to suppress the people.
[01:14:58.408 --> 01:15:01.730]  And a talk about whether such meetings should become a regular occurrence.
[01:15:02.091 --> 01:15:08.115]  Yes, you've got to openly merge all the corporations in every decision together as if it isn't already going on.
[01:15:08.476 --> 01:15:14.040]  You've got to get the CIA and the globalists embedded in all these together right there at point-blank range.
[01:15:15.848 --> 01:15:18.572]  And part of that is the whole media working together to shut us down.
[01:15:18.912 --> 01:15:22.217]  They go to Robert Mueller's office and how he needs them to fight Russians.
[01:15:22.758 --> 01:15:23.699]  Oh, Mueller!
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:24.841]  Oh, yes!
[01:15:25.402 --> 01:15:26.443]  Fight the Russkies!
[01:15:26.483 --> 01:15:28.847]  Can't let America become great again.
[01:15:31.122 --> 01:15:32.884]  Oh my gosh, we're out of time.
[01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:36.606]  We've got a South African farmer, one of the leaders of the group, warning what was coming.
[01:15:36.646 --> 01:15:37.327]  It's now happened.
[01:15:37.347 --> 01:15:37.947]  That's coming up.
[01:15:37.987 --> 01:15:50.998]  Just please remember, without you sharing the videos at Infowars.com, without you sharing the articles, without you telling folks at the local AM and FM stations and TV stations how you're listening to The Enemy Will Win, I'm betting on you just like President Trump is.
[01:15:51.018 --> 01:15:57.202]  But go to Infowars.com forward slash show, sign up for the free podcast, the free newsletter, and tell everybody you know to do it.
[01:15:57.222 --> 01:15:58.523]  This is the verboten info.
[01:15:58.924 --> 01:16:00.345]  This is the Streisand effect.
[01:16:02.335 --> 01:16:07.537]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:16:07.677 --> 01:16:08.757]  I don't know exactly what happened.
[01:16:08.977 --> 01:16:10.137]  Sandy Hook's very conclusive.
[01:16:10.317 --> 01:16:18.400]  For years, Alex Jones was the most powerful voice behind a disturbing conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook shooting was a massive hoax.
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.821]  He has claimed the school shooting was a hoax.
[01:16:20.941 --> 01:16:28.443]  Alex Jones is making news and the parents of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut are quite disturbed by some of the messages he's sending out.
[01:16:28.663 --> 01:16:33.144]  People who believe Jones have for years harassed and taunted families of the victims.
[01:16:33.664 --> 01:16:37.625]  The lawsuits filed in April seek at least $1 million in damages.
[01:16:37.665 --> 01:16:46.847]  Jones' comments have caused them a severe degree of mental stress and anguish, which have disrupted their daily routine and caused a high degree of psychological pain.
[01:16:46.867 --> 01:16:52.069]  Parents have said Jones has engaged in a campaign of false, cruel and dangerous assertions.
[01:16:52.169 --> 01:16:56.870]  A theory that Leonard Posner and Veronique de la Rosa say turned their lives upside down.
[01:16:57.170 --> 01:17:06.834]  The parents of six-year-old Noah Posner, who was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, say Jones' followers have tormented them with death threats, forcing them to move seven times.
[01:17:06.854 --> 01:17:09.656]  I can't imagine being a Sandy Hook parent and having to go through this.
[01:17:09.776 --> 01:17:12.937]  Alex Jones, his commentary about Sandy Hook is disgusting.
[01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:13.978]  It's appalling.
[01:17:14.158 --> 01:17:15.438]  We all stand against it.
[01:17:15.458 --> 01:17:19.420]  9-11, on the left and the right, we stand against this kind of hate speech, which is what it is.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:24.544]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[01:17:24.584 --> 01:17:26.565]  They're alleging in these lawsuits a conspiracy.
[01:17:26.766 --> 01:17:34.752]  A reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[01:17:34.852 --> 01:17:37.634]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[01:17:37.794 --> 01:17:39.555]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[01:17:40.976 --> 01:17:42.577]  Good friends, family.
[01:17:42.617 --> 01:17:50.299]  And I say, well, you know, tell me if you're so, you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[01:17:50.339 --> 01:17:52.059]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times.
[01:17:52.079 --> 01:17:56.360]  They'll send me a link to some other article saying, paraphrasing what you said.
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:58.821]  I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:02.722]  And when I go find it, I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[01:18:03.542 --> 01:18:05.363]  Well then, you know, then there's this backpedal.
[01:18:05.383 --> 01:18:08.686]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:13.169]  There was another lawsuit this week targeting people that promote conspiracy theories.
[01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:16.892]  It involves InfoWars and the host of InfoWars, Alex Jones.
[01:18:17.252 --> 01:18:32.282]  Already InfoWars is at risk of losing its YouTube channel, and now this lawsuit is trying to take Jones and InfoWars and others to court, saying they're responsible for promoting hoaxes that actually are defamatory toward the people involved.
[01:18:32.362 --> 01:18:33.023]  CNN has been
[01:18:33.303 --> 01:18:35.804]  Basically a murder for free speech for the last 21st.
[01:18:36.304 --> 01:18:41.446]  At the same time, they're telling us how important it is that people should be able to say what they think.
[01:18:41.866 --> 01:18:45.487]  They are agitating for Alex Jones to be pulled off YouTube.
[01:18:45.507 --> 01:18:51.229]  Now I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than like Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:18:51.809 --> 01:18:55.673]  Well, he's got a point of view, and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:59.658]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[01:19:00.138 --> 01:19:02.501]  He's been called a freak show and downright dangerous.
[01:19:02.561 --> 01:19:09.629]  People have free speech in this country, but no matter how hateful, no matter how stupid, no matter how inane, give them their time, give them Thorazine also.
[01:19:10.109 --> 01:19:11.770]  What is the matter with this person?
[01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:14.533]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[01:19:14.573 --> 01:19:17.495]  The hypocrisy is just astounding.
[01:19:17.735 --> 01:19:23.219]  And I guarantee you that if you flipped over to CNN right now, there would not be a single story about the Twitter shadow banning.
[01:19:23.399 --> 01:19:24.360]  There would not be a single story.
[01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:37.751]  And the only story you would see about YouTube pulling Alex Jones videos would be probably something celebratory about, you know, a scalp of sorts for managing to eventually get their way.
[01:19:38.331 --> 01:19:38.952]  On that story.
[01:19:39.052 --> 01:19:44.736]  Jones' lawyers will be back in court for a separate defamation case related to the Parkland shooting tomorrow.
[01:19:44.776 --> 01:19:50.901]  This was probably the first time that anybody in that courtroom had actually watched InfoWars.
[01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:52.362]  Had actually seen what you said.
[01:19:53.002 --> 01:20:00.508]  And if you watch what you said, and you compare that to what the press has reported that you said, it's as if those two things are happening on two different planets.
[01:20:06.252 --> 01:20:08.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.798 --> 01:20:27.468]  You thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:20:29.089 --> 01:20:34.233]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.524 --> 01:20:45.748]  Trump warned that South Africa would implode in 2013 and boy has he been right.
[01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.109]  Doesn't mean we're defending apartheid.
[01:20:47.129 --> 01:20:50.411]  Doesn't mean we're defending Muammar Gaddafi in the north.
[01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:53.793]  But he was stabilizing much of the area as soon as he was taken out.
[01:20:54.233 --> 01:20:55.814]  Everything around it is collapsing.
[01:20:56.555 --> 01:21:01.338]  And so, you know, whether it was Gaddafi's system or South African system, it's very, very sad.
[01:21:02.887 --> 01:21:21.424]  And Simon Roche is one of the leaders of the movement that has been pointing out that the major political parties, both the ANC and others, were moving in a big, big, big, big way towards exterminating all the whites and taking their land.
[01:21:21.444 --> 01:21:24.227]  And that was their political campaign platforms.
[01:21:24.287 --> 01:21:26.829]  And we're going to play some of those videos coming up.
[01:21:26.849 --> 01:21:28.611]  But now you've had the president
[01:21:30.114 --> 01:21:32.455]  And the deputy come out and say, we're going to start taking the land.
[01:21:32.475 --> 01:21:33.015]  They tried.
[01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:35.035]  Local police would not carry it out.
[01:21:35.935 --> 01:21:36.696]  At least in some areas.
[01:21:36.736 --> 01:21:38.676]  You have killings every day going on.
[01:21:39.376 --> 01:21:41.677]  You have Africa imploding all over the place.
[01:21:41.697 --> 01:21:46.818]  You have the numbers 100 million now, reportedly, according to our South African sources, from 50 million in the census.
[01:21:48.018 --> 01:21:50.619]  So Africa is collapsing to the north, into Europe.
[01:21:51.977 --> 01:21:58.538]  It's collapsing into the South and Simon Roche runs a super high-tech organization in modern farming.
[01:21:58.558 --> 01:22:08.821]  When I said they're like Amish, reading books about it, talking to other folks, they're out in the middle of the country, they work really hard, they're Christians, they're praying every couple hours, and they're not living in fancy surroundings.
[01:22:09.261 --> 01:22:17.843]  I see that as like Mennonites, or like Amish-like, but he pointed out to me off-air that we're not really an Amish sect, which is true, that comes out of Switzerland, they're from the Netherlands.
[01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:20.164]  They've been there 400 years.
[01:22:20.745 --> 01:22:21.986]  And I've looked at the history books.
[01:22:22.006 --> 01:22:23.147]  There was almost no one down there.
[01:22:23.167 --> 01:22:28.091]  As soon as they made everything green, all these big tribes moved down to be around the money and around the success, which is fine.
[01:22:28.331 --> 01:22:29.852]  Then the British invaded to take it over.
[01:22:30.433 --> 01:22:31.274]  This is all history.
[01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:39.561]  And it looks like the British today are the ones manipulating, because they want a failed state like the Chinese do, to not have any industry or any life just come in and extract things.
[01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:41.583]  We'll talk big picture coming up.
[01:22:41.783 --> 01:22:43.684]  We'll look at the close in here.
[01:22:44.679 --> 01:22:49.480]  In just a little while, but I saw articles where, oh, out of the major Canadian broadcasters and the U.S.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:55.182]  broadcasters, South Africa leader fact-checks Trump on white farmers' tweet.
[01:22:55.722 --> 01:22:58.043]  They don't show the video, they just say, oh, he fact-checks him.
[01:22:58.623 --> 01:23:04.504]  When you actually see what Julius said, Malema said, he said, yeah, we're going to kill you.
[01:23:04.544 --> 01:23:05.405]  Yeah, we're going to take your land.
[01:23:05.425 --> 01:23:06.765]  We're going to play what he said in English.
[01:23:07.385 --> 01:23:12.126]  So our own media, the British government and others, are saying, yes, take the white farmers' land.
[01:23:12.146 --> 01:23:13.887]  But I just saw a video we'll show next segment.
[01:23:15.486 --> 01:23:19.448]  Of Zimbabwe, where they killed all the farmers who drove them out.
[01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:24.912]  Now that that dictatorship's out for decades, the blacks are hugging the whites and begging them to come back.
[01:23:26.332 --> 01:23:27.493]  And what are they begging to come back?
[01:23:27.513 --> 01:23:29.094]  Christianity, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:30.034 --> 01:23:32.136]  There it is, Zimbabwe farmers coming back.
[01:23:32.176 --> 01:23:35.598]  This is what folks think, after they've been gone for a while.
[01:23:36.038 --> 01:23:38.059]  So, that's the breakdown, as well as the rest of the hour.
[01:23:38.999 --> 01:23:40.881]  It's S-U-I-D Landers.
[01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:43.546]  Suitlanders.org.
[01:23:43.626 --> 01:23:52.212]  Simon Roche is head of the office of the headquarters of the world's largest non-state civil defense organization, Southlanders of South Africa.
[01:23:52.852 --> 01:23:57.776]  Once an ANC activist, he now works tirelessly to prepare
[01:23:58.556 --> 01:24:02.918]  for impending catastrophe in the Rainbow Coalition.
[01:24:03.898 --> 01:24:07.459]  He also lives in Johannesburg and is the proud father of many children.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:11.941]  And he's predicted all of this here on the broadcast last year, this year, March 1st.
[01:24:12.721 --> 01:24:13.662]  It's all happened.
[01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:21.485]  So why don't you, for people this segment, I appreciate you joining us, give people the big view of what's really going on in South Africa versus Hollywood, who the players are.
[01:24:21.985 --> 01:24:25.706]  From what I've read, the fact that most African tribes want you there, but the communists don't.
[01:24:26.207 --> 01:24:26.987]  Explain what's going on.
[01:24:28.519 --> 01:24:36.089]  The big picture, Alex, is that South Africa has had multiracial democracy for about 24 years.
[01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:41.276]  And in that period, there has been a steady decline of many facets of the country.
[01:24:42.282 --> 01:24:53.626]  And it's now reached the point where the government is saying that it is going to expropriate white and owned land without compensation on the false basis that the land was stolen.
[01:24:53.686 --> 01:25:07.430]  Our president has made it clear that we have to rectify the original sin of South Africa, completely overlooking those portions of land that were uninhabited as proven by white and black historians alike.
[01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:22.045]  Overlooking the fact that the west of the Great Fish River of South Africa, approximately 40% of the country had never seen a black settlement in any way, shape or form ever by the time that the whites and blacks met.
[01:25:22.966 --> 01:25:25.128]  And that's because populations mainly lived on the sea.
[01:25:25.168 --> 01:25:26.489]  I mean, everywhere in the world.
[01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:28.391]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:28.432 --> 01:25:30.614]  In the sea and towards the north.
[01:25:31.843 --> 01:25:37.388]  Our country is sort of strangely shaped, so if I speak about North and West, it's kind of the equivalent of South and North.
[01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:48.776]  The reality, the actual reality is this, that much of that land was bought, let's not even talk about rights of conquest, which is recognized by all black tribes in Africa.
[01:25:49.256 --> 01:25:57.919]  There is no dispute over the land that was taken from the Hottentot and Koi people, the Bushmen and the Hottentot people.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.740]  There is no dispute over that.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:03.682]  There's no dispute over the land that the Zulus took from the Colossus.
[01:26:04.002 --> 01:26:06.603]  There's no dispute over the land taken by the Matabele.
[01:26:07.243 --> 01:26:12.245]  It's only land that whites might have taken and in many cases it was never taken.
[01:26:12.285 --> 01:26:15.246]  It was either not occupied or it was obtained by treaty.
[01:26:16.152 --> 01:26:16.773]  In those cases.
[01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:21.057]  So we're in a crisis now where the ANC said, right, we're going to take the land.
[01:26:21.137 --> 01:26:21.978]  This is our intention.
[01:26:21.998 --> 01:26:22.719]  This is our plan.
[01:26:22.979 --> 01:26:29.205]  But what we'll do, because we're Democrats, good people, we're going to hold a kind of a national referendum.
[01:26:29.585 --> 01:26:33.409]  We'll permit people to write in from all over South Africa and tell us their opinions.
[01:26:33.890 --> 01:26:37.493]  And we'll stage a roadshow across the country.
[01:26:37.954 --> 01:26:40.016]  And people can come and address
[01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:53.610]  So that's like when our own government says, we're going to ban this, but we're going to let you make comment, but they do what they want.
[01:26:54.811 --> 01:26:55.112]  Right.
[01:26:56.273 --> 01:27:02.078]  600 of the 700,000 written responses were opposed to the taking of the land.
[01:27:03.159 --> 01:27:06.702]  So the government probably said, well, we'll have to reopen that process.
[01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:16.278]  And they issued an instruction to their members, the African National Congress Party members, this time you better all write in, send faxes, emails, do whatever you've got to do.
[01:27:16.298 --> 01:27:24.061]  So let's be clear, the vast majority of the black and minority white members did the right thing and said don't take people's land, but the party wants it.
[01:27:25.529 --> 01:27:27.391]  The party wants the land for itself.
[01:27:27.631 --> 01:27:31.014]  Everybody must get used to one thing right from the beginning.
[01:27:31.494 --> 01:27:33.676]  There is not enough land to keep people happy.
[01:27:33.696 --> 01:27:37.939]  You can't give 50 million people 30,000 farms.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.841]  That's not maths.
[01:27:41.883 --> 01:27:43.204]  So who's going to get the farms?
[01:27:44.338 --> 01:27:46.599]  And as it is, I'd like to add one other thing.
[01:27:47.059 --> 01:27:54.222]  There is the fallacy that the 8.5% white population of South Africa owns 90% of the land or whatever you like.
[01:27:54.622 --> 01:27:55.782]  It's a complete fiction.
[01:27:55.922 --> 01:27:58.863]  To give you one example, and I could give you many, we'd be here all night.
[01:27:59.624 --> 01:28:06.646]  In the province of KwaZulu-Natal, the Zulu people as a nation do own and have always owned 32% of the province.
[01:28:08.823 --> 01:28:13.708]  There was never a case of 10% of the people owning 90% of the land.
[01:28:14.208 --> 01:28:16.030]  It is simply a fallacy.
[01:28:16.771 --> 01:28:18.692]  I'll tell you something that you might find interesting.
[01:28:19.313 --> 01:28:21.895]  The New York Times contacted me yesterday for an interview.
[01:28:21.935 --> 01:28:22.656]  We did an interview.
[01:28:22.696 --> 01:28:25.519]  They asked me about the trip to the USA last year.
[01:28:26.317 --> 01:28:28.519]  They asked me who we saw and so on.
[01:28:28.899 --> 01:28:31.602]  I said to them, well, you know, we saw some good people.
[01:28:31.662 --> 01:28:33.904]  Some people were not really our cup of tea.
[01:28:34.244 --> 01:28:36.746]  And they said, well, give us an example of somebody that you didn't like.
[01:28:36.786 --> 01:28:38.328]  I said, Dr. David Duke.
[01:28:38.348 --> 01:28:40.670]  Do you know how they reported it this morning?
[01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:43.832]  They said, we met Dr. David Duke.
[01:28:44.933 --> 01:28:46.335]  Completely overlooking the fact.
[01:28:46.355 --> 01:28:48.076]  So this narrative... Stay there.
[01:28:48.196 --> 01:28:48.536]  I know.
[01:28:48.637 --> 01:28:49.137]  No, I know.
[01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:50.899]  The New York Times is calling people
[01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.746]  Asking if I'm grabbing men's butts at the office.
[01:28:55.528 --> 01:28:58.835]  I mean, it is just... He's a Christian conservative.
[01:28:59.256 --> 01:29:01.862]  If we can say he grabs men's butts, maybe his supporters won't support him.
[01:29:10.106 --> 01:29:11.527]  My friends, we have done it.
[01:29:12.167 --> 01:29:18.289]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[01:29:18.889 --> 01:29:24.412]  This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[01:29:24.712 --> 01:29:30.954]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager, Dr. Edward Group, is here to test his greatest invention.
[01:29:31.154 --> 01:29:31.494]  Doctor?
[01:29:31.514 --> 01:29:33.075]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:29:33.475 --> 01:29:37.997]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[01:29:40.848 --> 01:29:44.049]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:45.870]  Thank you, Dr. Groot.
[01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:49.271]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[01:29:49.731 --> 01:29:50.932]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[01:29:51.672 --> 01:29:52.412]  This is the move.
[01:29:52.452 --> 01:29:53.973]  This is unprecedented.
[01:29:53.993 --> 01:29:56.714]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[01:29:57.014 --> 01:29:57.554]  Oh my God!
[01:29:57.794 --> 01:29:58.454]  What the hell?
[01:29:58.654 --> 01:29:59.354]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[01:29:59.374 --> 01:30:00.315]  Get out of here!
[01:30:00.335 --> 01:30:00.855]  Shut this down!
[01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:01.655]  This is not safe!
[01:30:01.915 --> 01:30:02.956]  This is not... Hold on!
[01:30:02.976 --> 01:30:03.316]  Settle down!
[01:30:04.176 --> 01:30:04.937]  Get another doctor.
[01:30:04.957 --> 01:30:05.537]  Something's wrong.
[01:30:05.797 --> 01:30:06.458]  Something's wrong with him.
[01:30:06.478 --> 01:30:06.998]  Help him.
[01:30:07.018 --> 01:30:09.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[01:30:09.139 --> 01:30:10.000]  I take it personally.
[01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:11.380]  Do not have those problems.
[01:30:12.021 --> 01:30:14.522]  Again, these are authorized herbs.
[01:30:14.923 --> 01:30:15.803]  Well known to be safe.
[01:30:17.184 --> 01:30:18.185]  Please, doctor.
[01:30:18.585 --> 01:30:19.445]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[01:30:19.645 --> 01:30:22.307]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut to commercial for just a moment.
[01:30:22.527 --> 01:30:23.028]  Cut, cut, cut.
[01:30:23.088 --> 01:30:27.870]  Get everybody out of here.
[01:30:28.571 --> 01:30:29.792]  Super male vitality.
[01:30:30.352 --> 01:30:30.972]  It's awesome.
[01:30:31.433 --> 01:30:33.214]  Just not this awesome.
[01:30:35.646 --> 01:30:38.368]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[01:30:38.928 --> 01:30:44.933]  It is satire to illustrate, in a satirical way, the incredible power of super male vitality.
[01:30:46.078 --> 01:30:54.104]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimickers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[01:30:54.605 --> 01:30:58.588]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:58.608 --> 01:31:01.990]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:03.531]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[01:31:03.551 --> 01:31:04.492]  It takes some focus.
[01:31:05.213 --> 01:31:06.734]  Up, up, and away!
[01:31:14.179 --> 01:31:18.609]  Start your journey to super male vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:31:35.444 --> 01:31:38.306]  Let's go ahead and talk to Make America Great Again, Titan.
[01:31:38.346 --> 01:31:39.607]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:31:39.767 --> 01:31:43.270]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:46.052]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[01:31:46.073 --> 01:31:48.675]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[01:31:48.735 --> 01:31:51.757]  Survival Shield, nascent iodine X2, life-changing.
[01:31:51.817 --> 01:31:53.699]  SuperMill Vitality, life-changing.
[01:31:53.739 --> 01:31:55.380]  BrainForce Plus, life-changing.
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.742]  SuperBlue non-fluoride toothpaste, life-changing.
[01:31:57.762 --> 01:31:59.243]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[01:31:59.263 --> 01:32:01.245]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[01:32:01.285 --> 01:32:02.926]  The hats, the t-shirts, amazing.
[01:32:03.146 --> 01:32:04.968]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[01:32:04.988 --> 01:32:06.209]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:32:06.249 --> 01:32:08.010]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:09.731]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[01:32:09.751 --> 01:32:11.553]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[01:32:11.613 --> 01:32:13.034]  Hispanic, strong supporter, like I said.
[01:32:13.134 --> 01:32:15.256]  And I started working out every day.
[01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:16.777]  I lift weights every day.
[01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:18.599]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[01:32:18.679 --> 01:32:20.320]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X2.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:21.561]  I drop that every morning.
[01:32:21.581 --> 01:32:22.562]  I feel fantastic.
[01:32:22.622 --> 01:32:23.582]  My skin is clearing up.
[01:32:23.602 --> 01:32:24.242]  I have psoriasis.
[01:32:24.262 --> 01:32:25.283]  So that's clearing up.
[01:32:25.323 --> 01:32:26.563]  My hair is going back thicker.
[01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:29.844]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[01:32:29.884 --> 01:32:31.824]  The brain force is just amazing.
[01:32:31.884 --> 01:32:33.145]  That stuff makes you think.
[01:32:33.285 --> 01:32:34.405]  It keeps you on your toes.
[01:32:34.425 --> 01:32:35.625]  The same thing with the iodine.
[01:32:35.645 --> 01:32:37.986]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[01:32:38.046 --> 01:32:39.386]  And your products are amazing.
[01:32:39.486 --> 01:32:41.767]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[01:32:42.167 --> 01:32:43.907]  And it's just life changing.
[01:32:43.967 --> 01:32:46.068]  And how people can go against the true resistance.
[01:32:46.108 --> 01:32:48.849]  They're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong side of history.
[01:32:48.869 --> 01:32:49.889]  And that's why we're the right.
[01:32:50.089 --> 01:32:51.591]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[01:32:51.631 --> 01:32:55.215]  And I've gotta say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[01:32:55.255 --> 01:32:56.816]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[01:32:56.836 --> 01:32:57.517]  You're the real deal.
[01:32:57.637 --> 01:33:00.640]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[01:33:06.266 --> 01:33:08.889]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.951 --> 01:33:25.271]  I'm good.
[01:34:04.847 --> 01:34:15.613]  You know, it's funny that Simon Roche of Southlanders, S-U-I-D, landers.org, one of the main leaders there of the farmer groups, brought the New York Times.
[01:34:15.673 --> 01:34:19.856]  I mean, I know the New York Times is bad for a long time, but I've had... Let me not exaggerate.
[01:34:21.258 --> 01:34:25.019]  Six people called me the last week, some of which I haven't seen in years.
[01:34:25.979 --> 01:34:29.320]  And they've called, like, first cousins, second cousins, you name it.
[01:34:29.941 --> 01:34:34.762]  And they say, we hear Alex Jones grabs men and fondles them around the office.
[01:34:35.762 --> 01:34:39.944]  And the people say, no, we've never seen him fondle anybody, not a woman, not a man.
[01:34:40.824 --> 01:34:47.426]  But that goes back to that fake EEOC complaint where the person said, who the Daily Mail admits they paid, by the way,
[01:34:48.919 --> 01:34:54.440]  Well, he never asked me out, but I felt like he was grooming me for gay sex.
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:57.761]  So telepathically now, this is going on.
[01:34:58.741 --> 01:35:06.863]  And I later learned from other people involved that the lawyers are sitting around and they're like, wait, people don't care about an employment problem.
[01:35:06.883 --> 01:35:08.704]  Let's say, what will hurt a conservative?
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:13.341]  They go, oh, let's say he's gay, which we're not even anti, we're not attacking anybody here.
[01:35:13.761 --> 01:35:18.622]  So that's what I'm getting at is, he brings up the New York Times, he's like, I don't like David Duke when I was in America.
[01:35:19.022 --> 01:35:22.422]  That turns into Simon Roche loves David Duke.
[01:35:22.462 --> 01:35:24.763]  This is the murdering of the truth.
[01:35:24.783 --> 01:35:28.823]  That's why at this point, used to I might talk to a reporter a little bit, because at least they get some of what you said.
[01:35:28.863 --> 01:35:29.204]  No, no, no.
[01:35:29.744 --> 01:35:32.384]  You can tell them the sky is blue, they'll say it's red.
[01:35:32.904 --> 01:35:34.324]  You cannot talk to them.
[01:35:34.364 --> 01:35:36.985]  They use it as the cover for their lie.
[01:35:37.808 --> 01:35:39.529]  And you have to understand, folks, they're going for broke.
[01:35:39.549 --> 01:35:42.831]  But Simon, I want to get into the current state, Trump coming out.
[01:35:43.892 --> 01:35:48.855]  We've got who the different players are in South Africa and how this always follows the same path.
[01:35:48.895 --> 01:35:50.656]  Please continue.
[01:35:50.937 --> 01:35:55.439]  Very simply, the ruling party is the African National Congress of Nelson Mandela.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.682]  They've been in power for 24 years solid.
[01:35:59.182 --> 01:36:01.043]  We have an election coming up next year in 2019.
[01:36:01.103 --> 01:36:01.483]  Their lapdog,
[01:36:04.585 --> 01:36:15.950]  The party that they have founded to occupy the political territory that they had to concede for world opinion, the African National Congress, couldn't be seen to be Marxist or openly Marxist.
[01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:18.931]  They found a party called the Economic Freedom Fighters.
[01:36:19.611 --> 01:36:26.895]  This party is ostensibly at loggerheads with them, always shouting, fighting, arguing, condemning and criticizing.
[01:36:27.175 --> 01:36:27.775]  But actually,
[01:36:28.439 --> 01:36:45.553]  They're implementing, or the driving force behind the implementation of certain written, recorded African National Congress policies in their, what they call their National Democratic Revolution documents.
[01:36:45.894 --> 01:36:49.477]  The ANC wants a National Democratic Revolution, a socialist revolution.
[01:36:49.877 --> 01:36:54.421]  They can't be seen to be the ones doing it, so they found a party
[01:36:55.288 --> 01:37:24.433]  of firebrands and these guys are saying we've got to do this we've got to do the ANC then says well look we probably should you know the blacks don't have any land the whites have got everything and we've got an election coming up so it's chaos here at the moment the value of our currency has plunged there are more than 19,000 of just 45,000 commercial farming units 19,000 farms for sale right now in South Africa some farmers are not planting crops
[01:37:25.053 --> 01:37:28.517]  Other farmers are trimming down their stock, their livestock, herds.
[01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:30.619]  Other farmers are renting.
[01:37:31.039 --> 01:37:32.560]  I spend a lot of time with farmers.
[01:37:33.501 --> 01:37:34.422]  I know this well.
[01:37:35.303 --> 01:37:43.371]  Other farmers are renting equipment rather than buying it themselves and renting land rather than making, you know, expansions.
[01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:43.631]  That's right.
[01:37:43.671 --> 01:37:46.674]  I've also read that yields are plunging and that famine could hit.
[01:37:48.354 --> 01:37:49.555]  The yields are plunging.
[01:37:49.956 --> 01:38:03.908]  We have become a net importer of food, which nobody ever foresaw happening, particularly 25 years ago, when we were told that the African National Congress would guarantee us a new South African rainbow nation utopia.
[01:38:04.408 --> 01:38:06.851]  And these things happen a little bit by a little bit by a little bit.
[01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:08.092]  They bring in a certain law.
[01:38:08.552 --> 01:38:09.853]  People get hurt and offended.
[01:38:10.674 --> 01:38:20.939]  And this is a microcosm of America and the West where they sell Christians the idea of everybody in harmony but then the left cheats and makes their whole thing racially based.
[01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:31.145]  That is precisely correct and it goes to this thing of the New York Times trying to draw a line between David Duke and Donald Trump through me.
[01:38:32.105 --> 01:38:37.871]  In other words, Simon Roach responding, Donald Trump tweeting about this thing, Mike Pompeo, etc, etc, etc.
[01:38:38.211 --> 01:38:43.075]  Well, we've spoken to Simon and he's big buddies with David Duke.
[01:38:43.096 --> 01:38:50.703]  Yeah, so go ahead and kill the white farmers, go ahead and let South Africa fail, because David Duke, when you said, I don't like David Duke, that becomes you love David Duke.
[01:38:51.143 --> 01:38:54.106]  Why couldn't the New York Times just be pro-prosperity for South Africa?
[01:38:57.150 --> 01:38:58.531]  Because they have an agenda.
[01:38:59.011 --> 01:39:00.211]  They have an agenda, Alex.
[01:39:00.231 --> 01:39:08.775]  By now, if you, not you, clearly you've been saying a lot of this stuff long before the rest of us woke up, never mind got out of bed.
[01:39:09.455 --> 01:39:12.476]  But if you can't see this, there's something wrong with you.
[01:39:12.496 --> 01:39:14.257]  The evidence is now overwhelming.
[01:39:14.637 --> 01:39:21.180]  There is an all out assault on Western European derived Caucasian Christian culture.
[01:39:21.832 --> 01:39:23.253]  That's just a reality.
[01:39:23.634 --> 01:39:27.737]  None of this stuff is happening in Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Borneo.
[01:39:28.157 --> 01:39:34.362]  It's all happening in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Western Europe, the USA, and to the whites of South Africa.
[01:39:34.763 --> 01:39:38.326]  If people cannot see it, the problem is with them, not with the evidence.
[01:39:40.004 --> 01:39:41.565]  And look, you have cold-blooded corporations.
[01:39:41.605 --> 01:39:43.806]  Look at 90% of the world being non-white.
[01:39:44.167 --> 01:39:45.367]  They're all a bunch of old white guys.
[01:39:45.727 --> 01:39:46.128]  They don't care.
[01:39:46.168 --> 01:39:46.828]  They just want power.
[01:39:46.868 --> 01:39:48.169]  They've already exploited the third world.
[01:39:48.729 --> 01:39:51.991]  And so, they've got the West being Christian, saying, let's all work together.
[01:39:52.311 --> 01:39:58.354]  They exploit the fact that we are trying to have a big tent because we love God and, you know, God's for all peoples.
[01:39:58.735 --> 01:40:00.476]  They exploit our openness as a weakness.
[01:40:00.816 --> 01:40:05.518]  While we're going, let's all love each other, they are bringing in third-world populations, radicalizing them.
[01:40:05.579 --> 01:40:07.440]  And like you said, the blacks voted.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.403]  You know, almost unanimously did not take your land.
[01:40:10.944 --> 01:40:16.591]  They understood that everybody was working together and it was Christian prosperity and a rainbow coalition, but they said no.
[01:40:17.679 --> 01:40:21.761]  The leadership said, no, we're going to kill them, we're going to run them out, because they want power.
[01:40:22.441 --> 01:40:27.623]  And obviously, we know who's really running the ANC, the British government, the globalists that have actually backed this.
[01:40:27.883 --> 01:40:30.785]  They want South Africa poor, just like North Africa.
[01:40:30.825 --> 01:40:32.906]  They killed Gaddafi so that nobody gets anything.
[01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:33.726]  They want squalor.
[01:40:33.746 --> 01:40:35.887]  It's like when the Chinese come in, they build a big camp.
[01:40:36.247 --> 01:40:37.488]  The outsiders get nothing.
[01:40:37.988 --> 01:40:42.210]  But when the West comes in, railroads, medicine, everything, the Christians lift everybody up.
[01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.477]  And the globalists say, no, the Africans die.
[01:40:45.778 --> 01:40:47.543]  And I think that's the big secret truth here.
[01:40:48.891 --> 01:40:49.671]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:49.972 --> 01:40:54.694]  You know, it's a bit like David Icke's Luciferian consciousness.
[01:40:54.714 --> 01:41:01.617]  You can call it crazy if you like, but that's another example of a person yourself, Donald Trump, and others who were prescient about this stuff.
[01:41:01.797 --> 01:41:03.038]  Uncannily prescient.
[01:41:03.598 --> 01:41:10.562]  This thing is clearly directed at a certain culture, a certain religion, a certain ethos.
[01:41:10.622 --> 01:41:11.782]  They want to get Christianity.
[01:41:11.802 --> 01:41:12.283]  That's it.
[01:41:12.303 --> 01:41:12.963]  So explain that.
[01:41:13.063 --> 01:41:14.504]  Why do they want to get Christianity so bad?
[01:41:15.509 --> 01:41:19.990]  That's what this comes down to, and this is what we've been saying for a long, long, long time, and people laugh at us.
[01:41:20.270 --> 01:41:22.551]  They scoff, like they scoff and sneer at you.
[01:41:22.951 --> 01:41:26.492]  Except that when you get proof right, then they find another angle of attack.
[01:41:28.293 --> 01:41:31.194]  We're going to come back and play some of these clips, but what is the endgame?
[01:41:31.234 --> 01:41:41.117]  I mean, the numbers, I see the videos are of the slaughtered whites, tortured to death, and then we've got, in fact I forgot to play the clip, MSNBC made a joke about it and said, big deal if whites are being killed.
[01:41:42.952 --> 01:41:44.133]  Yeah, that's lovely.
[01:41:44.253 --> 01:41:47.836]  And the little girls raped?
[01:41:47.856 --> 01:41:49.417]  They literally think it's funny on the news.
[01:41:51.019 --> 01:41:53.020]  Yeah, they think it's very funny.
[01:41:53.060 --> 01:41:54.561]  These people are perverts, Alex.
[01:41:54.962 --> 01:42:02.268]  And people like you and I have to ensure that our children don't marry into those gene pools, that we warn everybody that we can.
[01:42:02.308 --> 01:42:04.850]  These people are perverse to the marrow of their bones.
[01:42:05.250 --> 01:42:06.111]  That's the reality.
[01:42:06.151 --> 01:42:08.813]  They will happily take your money to fund
[01:42:10.849 --> 01:42:13.932]  birth clinics in Uganda while telling you not to breed.
[01:42:14.312 --> 01:42:23.720]  They'll happily tell you that you as a Christian are meant to accept Muslims whose God tells them to hate you and to relentlessly hate you and never to stop hating you.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.482]  It's unbelievable.
[01:42:26.667 --> 01:42:30.391]  Well, they're trying to get everybody to turn off their live for us, and we'll play some of these clips when we come back.
[01:42:30.832 --> 01:42:33.775]  This guy came out and said, get the Jews, get the Christians, get everybody.
[01:42:34.056 --> 01:42:37.840]  And then our media ran it and said, oh, the black leader checks Trump.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:38.841]  Nobody's killing whites.
[01:42:38.902 --> 01:42:39.863]  Nobody wants their land.
[01:42:40.523 --> 01:42:43.107]  And in the very video they play, he says, we're going to get your land.
[01:42:44.105 --> 01:42:47.526]  I mean, it is just, these fact-checkers are unbelievable.
[01:42:47.926 --> 01:42:53.969]  Fact-checking is the biggest joke on the planet when it's run by George Soros and the rest of these people.
[01:42:53.989 --> 01:42:54.649]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:54.689 --> 01:42:59.811]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Simon Roche, live from South Africa, straight ahead.
[01:43:04.915 --> 01:43:23.225]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:43:23.325 --> 01:43:28.728]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:43:29.609 --> 01:43:30.269]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:43:30.389 --> 01:43:33.551]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[01:43:34.191 --> 01:43:35.172]  And so much more.
[01:43:35.732 --> 01:43:36.873]  It is concentrated.
[01:43:37.093 --> 01:43:38.794]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:43:38.814 --> 01:43:44.518]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:43:44.619 --> 01:43:45.819]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:43:45.839 --> 01:43:47.781]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:43:47.861 --> 01:43:50.242]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:43:50.463 --> 01:43:51.724]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:43:51.884 --> 01:43:53.705]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:43:54.265 --> 01:43:54.866]  Immune Wall.
[01:43:54.966 --> 01:43:56.287]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:44:13.257 --> 01:44:18.840]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:44:21.301 --> 01:44:27.645]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[01:45:02.757 --> 01:45:06.200]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.462]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:45:10.003 --> 01:45:15.807]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:45:16.267 --> 01:45:19.050]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:45:19.770 --> 01:45:23.234]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:45:23.594 --> 01:45:29.660]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:45:30.081 --> 01:45:35.046]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:45:35.788 --> 01:45:39.190]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:46.255]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:45:46.915 --> 01:45:51.598]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:45:52.159 --> 01:45:57.242]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:45:57.822 --> 01:46:01.785]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:46:04.975 --> 01:46:13.865]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[01:46:14.385 --> 01:46:25.417]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.

[01:47:05.701 --> 01:47:08.343]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.205 --> 01:47:21.274]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:47:21.614 --> 01:47:23.578]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.094 --> 01:47:31.758]  All right, let me ask one of the main leaders of the Africana Farmers, Simon Roche, where he thinks this is all ending.
[01:47:32.498 --> 01:47:33.139]  Who's behind it?
[01:47:33.159 --> 01:47:36.340]  I've got several of these clips I want to play as well, but I want to ask him right now.
[01:47:37.361 --> 01:47:38.041]  Where does this end?
[01:47:38.061 --> 01:47:45.126]  Because I had you on last year, I had you on this year, and they had media matters and mainstream corporate media say, Jones is insane!
[01:47:45.566 --> 01:47:48.007]  He's got a farmer on claiming they're killing whites.
[01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:49.428]  Why, no one ever kills whites.
[01:47:50.268 --> 01:47:52.390]  And they fire reporters that report on that here in the U.S.
[01:47:53.050 --> 01:48:00.896]  And then, oh, no one's trying to take land when the president, the vice president, the defense minister are saying, we're not going to take your land, we're going to kill you.
[01:48:01.516 --> 01:48:05.600]  And then when whites try to leave, they tell Australia, don't take those races, they stay here.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.702]  So just describe where you think this is going.
[01:48:10.652 --> 01:48:15.099]  We believe that it's going to end in a crisis of epic proportions.
[01:48:15.619 --> 01:48:18.704]  We believe that this situation is intractable.
[01:48:18.744 --> 01:48:24.593]  That doesn't stop us from being decent, respectable, God-fearing, hard-working, tax-paying people.
[01:48:25.574 --> 01:48:25.815]  But
[01:48:27.889 --> 01:48:29.610]  It's one thing to be law-abiding.
[01:48:29.770 --> 01:48:31.131]  It's another thing to be foolish.
[01:48:31.752 --> 01:48:37.375]  And we believe, if we examine the trajectory of our state, that it is going to end in a collision.
[01:48:37.875 --> 01:48:40.416]  We believe that there will be a civil war in this country.
[01:48:40.577 --> 01:48:43.738]  If there's not, the world can laugh at us forever.
[01:48:44.699 --> 01:48:49.602]  Our friends, our family, and so on, can mock us and shun us until the days of our deaths.
[01:48:50.162 --> 01:48:53.304]  But, so far, we've been right every step of the way.
[01:48:54.002 --> 01:49:00.166]  We have never, ever made any error in our predictions because they're obvious, conspicuous predictions.
[01:49:00.586 --> 01:49:02.107]  We said that they would take the land.
[01:49:02.688 --> 01:49:04.289]  We said that they would disempower us.
[01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:13.295]  We said that they would take our weapons away as they shut down the commando system or as they asked for weapons to be given in, handed in for free in the year 2000.
[01:49:13.895 --> 01:49:17.397]  At the same time, they destroyed 199,000
[01:49:21.244 --> 01:49:33.364]  Weapons in the hands of the commando system that protected the farmers and destroyed only 6,000 of the 2 million Acknowledged weapons that the African National Congress brought into the country illegally
[01:49:35.177 --> 01:49:36.017]  What does that tell you?
[01:49:36.297 --> 01:49:37.998]  They are trying to disempower us.
[01:49:38.318 --> 01:49:39.738]  They don't want us to have weapons.
[01:49:39.758 --> 01:49:42.899]  They don't want us to have a commando system to protect the farmers.
[01:49:43.119 --> 01:49:43.539]  For what?
[01:49:43.659 --> 01:49:44.579]  What could be the reason?
[01:49:44.979 --> 01:49:47.980]  We believe that this is one giant, enormous setup.
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.120]  If we end up being wrong, fine.
[01:49:50.420 --> 01:49:51.680]  In the meantime, we will pay our taxes.
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.380]  Yeah, but they're not wrong.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.121]  I mean, the commies are all saying they're going to kill you.
[01:49:54.501 --> 01:49:56.641]  This has happened in country after country in Africa.
[01:49:56.661 --> 01:50:00.382]  This is the blueprint because the establishment wants to come in and loot everything.
[01:50:01.203 --> 01:50:06.791]  Let's go ahead and get into this individual that our media is saying fact-checked Trump, and he basically says stuff even worse.
[01:50:07.412 --> 01:50:08.874]  Let's talk about Julius.
[01:50:09.856 --> 01:50:10.798]  Tell us about this guy.
[01:50:12.136 --> 01:50:15.639]  Julius Malema is the head of the Economic Freedom Fighters Party.
[01:50:16.039 --> 01:50:21.344]  He's the former head of the African National Congress's very, very ferocious Youth League.
[01:50:21.864 --> 01:50:30.312]  He is the guy who famously said on the, I believe it was the 6th of November 2016, I'm not calling for the slaughter of all whites yet.
[01:50:30.712 --> 01:50:36.137]  He has subsequently said that his mission in life is to cut the throat of whiteness.
[01:50:36.929 --> 01:50:40.112]  And he is the main agitator behind the taking of the land.
[01:50:40.452 --> 01:50:45.116]  He has also warned farmers that he is going to have no mercy on them.
[01:50:46.116 --> 01:50:46.617]  That's right.
[01:50:46.657 --> 01:50:49.039]  And then we saw the worship Nelson Mandela.
[01:50:49.079 --> 01:50:50.780]  He was a total front of the globalists, we know.
[01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:54.723]  His wife literally hung tires over little kids' heads, black and white.
[01:50:55.244 --> 01:50:55.904]  And that's another thing.
[01:50:56.805 --> 01:51:00.608]  The numbers of the black-on-black crime by these groups, it's incredible.
[01:51:01.986 --> 01:51:03.027]  It's phenomenal, Alex.
[01:51:03.368 --> 01:51:06.512]  You know, that's one of the main arguments of the mainstream.
[01:51:06.953 --> 01:51:09.236]  They'll say, well, blacks are also being killed.
[01:51:09.276 --> 01:51:09.896]  That's fine.
[01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:11.519]  But we don't want to be killed.
[01:51:11.939 --> 01:51:12.720]  Thank you very much.
[01:51:15.501 --> 01:51:21.509]  The government released statistics on farm murders on the 4th of May this year, for the first time in seven years.
[01:51:21.869 --> 01:51:25.594]  The fact that they hadn't released them for seven years should tell you something.
[01:51:25.614 --> 01:51:26.375]  That should be enough!
[01:51:26.655 --> 01:51:30.019]  We shouldn't have to say any more than that, that they were killing... Yeah, what do you make of U.S.
[01:51:30.039 --> 01:51:33.504]  commentators joking, saying, big deal if you get killed or only a few of you have been killed?
[01:51:33.524 --> 01:51:34.225]  What's the real numbers?
[01:51:35.512 --> 01:51:47.199]  The real numbers are difficult to tell, but the minimum possible rate, if you take the statistics and you do simple arithmetic, the minimum possible rate is 97 farmers per 100,000 per annum.
[01:51:47.299 --> 01:51:54.243]  Compare that to a murder rate in the USA of about 4.88 per 100,000, a national murder rate in South Africa of about 34 per 100,000.
[01:51:54.303 --> 01:51:55.304]  But I would say to you,
[01:52:04.051 --> 01:52:27.421]  That the murder rate of farmers, given that these statistics are slightly murky, they've tried very hard not to be explicit, if we give them the benefit of the doubt, if we say that some of the people murdered on the farms are farm workers, one or two here or there, if we give them every benefit of the doubt, we would say that the murder rate of farmers, according to the statistics produced,
[01:52:28.081 --> 01:52:33.763]  By the South African government, not by us, is 169 per 100,000.
[01:52:35.044 --> 01:52:41.146]  If that's not enough for the New York Times and for MSNBC and for the rest, may it be on their heads.
[01:52:41.686 --> 01:52:42.546]  Well, they love it.
[01:52:42.586 --> 01:52:44.907]  They work for Soros, so they don't care he's a Nazi collaborator.
[01:52:44.927 --> 01:52:45.307]  They love it.
[01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:47.028]  They've watched all these evil wars.
[01:52:47.048 --> 01:52:47.748]  They run the whole thing.
[01:52:47.768 --> 01:52:51.510]  Let's go to Julius Malema with a few of his clips.
[01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.890]  Here it is.
[01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:56.393]  We must be prepared for Donald Trump and all of them.
[01:52:56.834 --> 01:52:59.395]  We're not scared of them.
[01:52:59.475 --> 01:53:01.257]  We remain unshaken.
[01:53:01.757 --> 01:53:08.662]  Actually, we are more determined after the Donald Trump tweet to expropriate our land without compensation.
[01:53:10.703 --> 01:53:12.525]  There's no white genocide here.
[01:53:12.765 --> 01:53:13.946]  It's an absolute rubbish.
[01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:19.675]  To say there is white genocide, there is black genocide in the USA!
[01:53:19.695 --> 01:53:23.219]  They are killing black people in the USA.
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:25.722]  There is black genocide, yeah!
[01:53:26.781 --> 01:53:30.105]  In South Africa, black people are being killed all the time.
[01:53:30.725 --> 01:53:35.871]  A farmer has been sentenced to life now recently for having killed a farm worker.
[01:53:36.351 --> 01:53:41.557]  Imagine if it was a black person sent to life for having killed a white person.
[01:53:42.018 --> 01:53:43.439]  It will be news all over.
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:48.364]  But this black person was killed and a white farmer sent to prison for long.
[01:53:49.225 --> 01:53:50.026]  Time in jail.
[01:53:50.707 --> 01:53:52.668]  It's once off reporting and it's done.
[01:53:53.869 --> 01:54:00.856]  There's no scientific evidence that points to any white genocide in South Africa.
[01:54:01.516 --> 01:54:02.157]  It's not true.
[01:54:03.118 --> 01:54:04.779]  And we're not scared of such things.
[01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:08.262]  We're not going to be distracted by anyone.
[01:54:09.583 --> 01:54:11.045]  Only death will stop us.
[01:54:11.765 --> 01:54:12.306]  Not Trump.
[01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:13.847]  Not poverty.
[01:54:14.808 --> 01:54:15.589]  Not sanctions.
[01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:18.777]  We have all of them in our mind.
[01:54:19.737 --> 01:54:23.879]  We know the consequences of what we're... Yeah, another failed state.
[01:54:24.819 --> 01:54:26.380]  And so here's the EFF leader.
[01:54:26.460 --> 01:54:27.460]  I watch the whole 7-Minute Club.
[01:54:27.500 --> 01:54:28.041]  Here's the club.
[01:54:28.641 --> 01:54:37.164]  Well, this crazy thing about Jews are training a group of right-wing people to kill them when they're all over saying we're going to kill you and take your land.
[01:54:37.204 --> 01:54:37.564]  Here it is.
[01:54:38.845 --> 01:54:41.386]  There's a group of white right-wingers.
[01:54:42.435 --> 01:54:46.783]  We are being trained by Jews in Pretoria to be snipers.
[01:54:48.666 --> 01:54:49.207]  Snipers.
[01:54:51.471 --> 01:54:53.054]  They are not training guns.
[01:54:54.275 --> 01:54:59.579]  In the year, we were training toy guns, dealing with real stuff.
[01:54:59.719 --> 01:55:01.120]  Alright, let's stop there.
[01:55:01.501 --> 01:55:03.442]  Let's go back to the full seven-minute press conference.
[01:55:03.462 --> 01:55:04.323]  He did this yesterday.
[01:55:04.963 --> 01:55:07.085]  Here he is talking about the EU, Trump.
[01:55:07.905 --> 01:55:08.986]  They're all coming down here.
[01:55:09.166 --> 01:55:10.127]  I mean, all coming down there.
[01:55:10.167 --> 01:55:16.652]  It's the big banks and corporations want Africa to fail because they come in with private contractors, just rope off what they want.
[01:55:17.172 --> 01:55:18.653]  They don't want Africa that's got six
[01:55:20.822 --> 01:55:24.605]  60% of the world's good fields to be the breadbasket of the world.
[01:55:24.665 --> 01:55:25.645]  I want to develop Africa.
[01:55:25.665 --> 01:55:26.966]  I want Africa to be happy and fun.
[01:55:27.347 --> 01:55:28.888]  I want Africa to be civilized.
[01:55:29.488 --> 01:55:33.771]  But the whole globalist plan since Cecil Rose is to not let it develop.
[01:55:33.811 --> 01:55:34.872]  Here he is breaking it down.
[01:55:36.233 --> 01:55:40.836]  My view is that Donald Trump is contributing in this debate which is going on.
[01:55:41.697 --> 01:55:46.921]  And in the process of contribution, Donald Trump make a similar contribution that were made by white people.
[01:55:47.321 --> 01:55:47.802]  All of them.
[01:55:48.797 --> 01:55:49.398]  In the hearings.
[01:55:49.518 --> 01:55:50.518]  In the public hearings.
[01:55:51.419 --> 01:55:55.022]  Donald Trump is not saying anything we have not heard from white people.
[01:55:56.243 --> 01:55:57.384]  In all the hearings.
[01:55:58.365 --> 01:56:05.090]  I even commented and said, I'm still to meet a white person who supports expropriation of land without compensation.
[01:56:05.630 --> 01:56:06.551]  So why are you shocked?
[01:56:07.692 --> 01:56:10.974]  I see leaders of the EFF and everybody responding to Donald Trump.
[01:56:11.635 --> 01:56:12.936]  I don't have time for nonsense.
[01:56:13.937 --> 01:56:14.857]  I expected this.
[01:56:16.239 --> 01:56:17.800]  And more backlash is going to come.
[01:56:19.284 --> 01:56:29.452]  If South Africans are not ready to expropriate the land because they are scared of sanctions, they are scared of black lives, then don't vote for the EFF.
[01:56:31.354 --> 01:56:34.136]  Because you vote for us, we are going to expropriate land.
[01:56:35.617 --> 01:56:37.278]  And Donald Trump will come for us.
[01:56:38.279 --> 01:56:39.820]  And Britain will come for us.
[01:56:40.861 --> 01:56:42.582]  And the EU will come for us.
[01:56:44.564 --> 01:56:48.047]  I said and I said this throughout my life in the movement that
[01:56:49.767 --> 01:56:53.949]  For everything good comes the pain before.
[01:56:56.150 --> 01:56:59.431]  If you're not prepared, South Africa, to take the pain.
[01:56:59.811 --> 01:57:02.353]  So he goes on, just like Venezuela and North Korea fail.
[01:57:02.393 --> 01:57:05.314]  He's even getting them ready for decades of him to extract billions out.
[01:57:05.914 --> 01:57:07.695]  And I guess he'll have 25 Ferraris or whatever.
[01:57:07.715 --> 01:57:09.376]  We're gonna come back in five more minutes with our guest.
[01:57:10.016 --> 01:57:11.557]  But this is just insane.
[01:57:11.617 --> 01:57:14.018]  It's the big mega banks that funded
[01:57:14.984 --> 01:57:15.304]  Thank you.
[01:57:36.276 --> 01:57:36.477]  50% off.
[01:57:36.977 --> 01:57:37.557]  Just try some.
[01:57:37.617 --> 01:57:38.478]  It funds the broadcast.
[01:57:38.498 --> 01:57:39.058]  You can't lose.
[01:57:39.999 --> 01:57:45.543]  And, beyond whey, beyond spirulina, it's bone broth with a bunch of other key ingredients, now $19.95.
[01:57:45.583 --> 01:57:49.886]  50% off the introductory offer of the new formulation of ultimate bone broth.
[01:57:52.508 --> 01:57:56.912]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[01:57:57.952 --> 01:58:02.516]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[01:58:04.517 --> 01:58:07.600]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:10.262]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[01:58:14.105 --> 01:58:18.608]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[01:58:18.849 --> 01:58:23.392]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[01:58:23.672 --> 01:58:27.776]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[01:58:30.878 --> 01:58:32.039]  Getting a good picture everybody?
[01:58:39.196 --> 01:58:42.660]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:46.825]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[01:58:47.005 --> 01:58:51.851]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[01:58:52.511 --> 01:58:53.693]  He's not a politician.
[01:58:53.713 --> 01:58:55.214]  He's one of us.
[01:58:57.717 --> 01:58:59.860]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[01:59:02.333 --> 01:59:04.857]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[01:59:05.578 --> 01:59:13.409]  Embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference.
[01:59:13.829 --> 01:59:19.277]  Treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation.
[01:59:20.444 --> 01:59:22.785]  Three American hostages are back home.
[01:59:23.285 --> 01:59:27.747]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[01:59:28.407 --> 01:59:29.388]  Seize this moment.
[01:59:29.768 --> 01:59:30.888]  Believe in yourselves.
[01:59:31.329 --> 01:59:32.449]  Believe in your future.
[01:59:32.969 --> 01:59:35.450]  And believe once more in America.
[01:59:36.451 --> 01:59:40.373]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
[01:59:41.713 --> 01:59:44.995]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[01:59:45.435 --> 01:59:47.896]  The forgotten man and the forgotten woman.
[01:59:49.056 --> 01:59:51.357]  You're not forgotten anymore.
[01:59:51.377 --> 02:00:03.544]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:06.726 --> 02:00:11.149]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:11.729 --> 02:00:13.250]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.899 --> 02:00:24.065]  So Simon Roche, one of the main leaders, the leader over in South Africa, predicting the land seizure, because they said they'd do it, the murder of white farmers.
[02:00:24.085 --> 02:00:26.707]  And as he said, they had a vote and the majority of blacks said no.
[02:00:27.167 --> 02:00:32.151]  We love the white farmers, we work with them, they work with us, we're good, but it's that communist group.
[02:00:32.751 --> 02:00:38.758]  It's also, we know, double the population in the last 20 years, bringing in folks from Northern Africa, who then promised all these goodies.
[02:00:38.778 --> 02:00:45.626]  So in the five minutes we have left, Simon, it's just an amazing time to see Trump stand up against this in our own media, demonize it, the British government.
[02:00:46.026 --> 02:00:47.428]  Say, yeah, we support taking land.
[02:00:48.169 --> 02:00:50.872]  What's really behind this and what are other key points you'd like to add?
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:56.163]  Well, we'd like to thank President Trump for what he did.
[02:00:56.183 --> 02:00:58.505]  It is much appreciated by our people.
[02:00:58.925 --> 02:01:00.967]  We thank you for the work that you're doing, Alex.
[02:01:01.387 --> 02:01:03.509]  We ask people to support us, please.
[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:05.270]  Please support us.
[02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:06.712]  Go to our website.
[02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:08.113]  Donate via PayPal.
[02:01:08.473 --> 02:01:10.855]  Help us to continue to fight the good fight.
[02:01:11.215 --> 02:01:14.438]  We are fighting the good fight, not just on behalf of our people.
[02:01:14.898 --> 02:01:19.720]  But on behalf of our people all over the world, please help us to do this.
[02:01:20.121 --> 02:01:24.242]  We are a last bastion and we need your support.
[02:01:25.643 --> 02:01:27.484]  This thing is going to turn nasty.
[02:01:27.904 --> 02:01:29.565]  The people are positioning themselves.
[02:01:29.625 --> 02:01:34.747]  The various centres of power are clearly positioning themselves for a conflict.
[02:01:35.688 --> 02:01:42.251]  You only have to look at the material and we think it's going to get very, very rough very soon.
[02:01:43.769 --> 02:01:49.033]  Because there's this conquest attitude, just loot it all now, run off with the money, and then there's nothing there.
[02:01:49.153 --> 02:01:55.578]  Why do you think every African country that's kicked the Europeans out has collapsed back into the dust?
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:00.782]  Oh, Alex, that's a very difficult subject, but there is a...
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:10.306]  Naive, silly, foolish people will tell you they'll never do this because they don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
[02:02:10.426 --> 02:02:11.106]  And then they do it.
[02:02:11.527 --> 02:02:15.850]  And then whites will say, but they'll never do that because they don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
[02:02:16.311 --> 02:02:19.313]  They don't care about the goose that lays the golden egg.
[02:02:19.693 --> 02:02:23.677]  What they want is absolute power for themselves all of the time.
[02:02:24.017 --> 02:02:24.918]  They would rather have 100% of 10.
[02:02:27.190 --> 02:02:30.211]  than 10% of a million or a billion or a trillion.
[02:02:30.591 --> 02:02:32.712]  The point is that I am the big man.
[02:02:33.192 --> 02:02:34.753]  I want all of the power for myself.
[02:02:35.213 --> 02:02:38.234]  I want everything that exists for myself and I want no rivals.
[02:02:38.594 --> 02:02:53.480]  It is a bit like Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire who changed his name when he assumed power and the translation of his name that everybody knows is the cockerel to whom all the hens in the hen house belong.
[02:02:54.577 --> 02:02:56.781]  He changed his name when he took power in Zaire.
[02:02:57.181 --> 02:02:57.822]  To that name.
[02:02:58.624 --> 02:03:00.166]  He changed his name to the head rooster.
[02:03:02.793 --> 02:03:09.876]  The head rooster, and he famously would sleep with the wives of the men that he appointed to positions of power.
[02:03:10.877 --> 02:03:12.597]  And that's what this is about.
[02:03:13.578 --> 02:03:15.879]  They don't care how much destruction there is.
[02:03:16.279 --> 02:03:18.260]  They don't care if people are wiped out.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:20.801]  The point is to gain as much power as possible.
[02:03:20.921 --> 02:03:24.022]  It is a Marxism of a particular type.
[02:03:24.463 --> 02:03:27.544]  And it has been supported by the globalists because the globalists know
[02:03:28.266 --> 02:03:35.088]  That when this crisis occurs, somebody's going to have to run the mines, and somebody's going to have to exploit the minerals, and so on and so forth.
[02:03:35.408 --> 02:03:38.409]  And they will position themselves to take care of that, naturally.
[02:03:38.869 --> 02:03:39.730]  They can't lose.
[02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:50.453]  In fact, it's in their interest to sponsor... They use a society that's trying to be Christian and open and uplifting to get control, and they blow everything out and sit there in armored fortresses that no one else has electricity.
[02:03:50.473 --> 02:03:54.074]  Like Ceausescu, they have everything, their helicopters, everything.
[02:03:54.094 --> 02:03:55.474]  They just come extract it.
[02:03:55.895 --> 02:03:56.675]  It's a big joke.
[02:03:57.495 --> 02:03:59.716]  And, you know, you read about the stuff that's going on in Africa.
[02:03:59.796 --> 02:04:00.636]  It's so sad.
[02:04:01.096 --> 02:04:03.477]  And then the American left all backs up behind it.
[02:04:03.557 --> 02:04:07.499]  Not because they're dumb, but because they work for the big corporations that are actually going to do it.
[02:04:07.939 --> 02:04:09.379]  It's amazing.
[02:04:09.799 --> 02:04:11.140]  Simon Roche, we've got 30 seconds.
[02:04:11.180 --> 02:04:11.640]  Anything else?
[02:04:12.981 --> 02:04:17.582]  Well, I'd just like to say people should keep their eyes on this matter.
[02:04:17.922 --> 02:04:18.863]  Keep focused on it.
[02:04:19.003 --> 02:04:22.564]  Our leader, Mr. Gustav Mueller, has been unerringly correct.
[02:04:23.277 --> 02:04:25.418]  On this stuff, he's a bit like you, Alex.
[02:04:25.538 --> 02:04:27.359]  He looks at the facts, not at the fiction.
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:32.603]  He looks at what's really happening on the ground, rather than what people are told to believe.
[02:04:32.623 --> 02:04:35.204]  You know, the kind of thing of, who are you going to believe?
[02:04:35.564 --> 02:04:36.825]  Me or your lying eyes?
[02:04:37.345 --> 02:04:38.586]  Please, keep watching.
[02:04:38.666 --> 02:04:39.587]  Keep watching, people.
[02:04:39.667 --> 02:04:43.489]  You will see for yourselves what is transpiring in this country.
[02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:47.231]  And it's a prelude to what the left wants to do here and what they're openly teaching and pushing.
[02:04:47.271 --> 02:04:48.392]  God bless you, Simon Roach.
[02:04:48.412 --> 02:04:49.553]  We'll talk to you very, very soon.
[02:04:50.393 --> 02:04:51.874]  And thank you so much.
[02:04:51.914 --> 02:04:52.314]  God bless you.
[02:04:52.334 --> 02:04:55.516]  We may send some reporters out there to actually get a frontline view of this.
[02:04:55.656 --> 02:04:57.818]  All right, we'll be back with another special guest.
[02:04:57.858 --> 02:04:59.359]  Whatever you do, spread those live links.
[02:04:59.779 --> 02:05:00.880]  That's what gets around the censors.
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:09.544]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:05:09.624 --> 02:05:16.429]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:05:16.449 --> 02:05:31.979]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:05:36.980 --> 02:05:37.420]  Have you heard?
[02:05:37.441 --> 02:05:39.983]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:05:40.063 --> 02:05:41.364]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:05:41.524 --> 02:05:42.565]  They're all censoring us.
[02:05:42.946 --> 02:05:48.832]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:05:49.152 --> 02:05:52.175]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:06:05.347 --> 02:06:10.870]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:12.131]  Never!
[02:06:13.392 --> 02:06:16.553]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[02:06:16.813 --> 02:06:17.054]  No!
[02:06:17.094 --> 02:06:29.581]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[02:06:30.976 --> 02:06:32.018]  He predicted 9-11.
[02:06:32.398 --> 02:06:40.991]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[02:06:41.031 --> 02:06:44.937]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[02:06:49.741 --> 02:06:52.303]  Babylon Mystery Religion Ceremony!
[02:06:52.343 --> 02:06:56.967]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[02:06:56.987 --> 02:07:01.090]  Prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks.
[02:07:01.130 --> 02:07:04.373]  He helped reveal the so-called Goldeberg Group et al.
[02:07:04.433 --> 02:07:08.396]  And most of you are a bunch of stinking parasites!
[02:07:08.956 --> 02:07:14.481]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[02:07:17.063 --> 02:07:18.304]  They falsely edited him.
[02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:23.341]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[02:07:24.823 --> 02:07:28.406]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[02:07:30.908 --> 02:07:35.392]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[02:07:36.933 --> 02:07:41.377]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[02:07:41.477 --> 02:07:43.840]  And then we get hit and say, you don't already use our software.
[02:07:45.075 --> 02:07:47.936]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[02:07:48.457 --> 02:07:50.037]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[02:07:50.077 --> 02:07:50.898]  They just killed our stream.
[02:07:52.118 --> 02:07:52.438]  Really?
[02:07:52.578 --> 02:07:52.799]  Yep.
[02:07:52.939 --> 02:07:55.520]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[02:07:57.221 --> 02:07:58.961]  This is America in 2018.
[02:07:59.021 --> 02:08:06.765]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[02:08:09.019 --> 02:08:10.220]  Will you do nothing?
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:15.203]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[02:08:15.923 --> 02:08:22.907]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[02:08:23.888 --> 02:08:28.830]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:53.138 --> 02:08:56.881]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:59.442 --> 02:09:02.584]  And we're back live now into the third hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:02.604 --> 02:09:04.426]  I'll be hosting some of the fourth hour as well.
[02:09:06.132 --> 02:09:08.213]  Notice the whole Russiagate situation.
[02:09:08.533 --> 02:09:12.815]  There's no Russiagate, there's no Russians, unless you're looking at Mueller and Hillary and the rest of them.
[02:09:13.195 --> 02:09:23.180]  Now it's moved into taxi cab companies and people that work for Trump and them going over all their taxes and trying to find something to get them to then say bad things about the President.
[02:09:23.741 --> 02:09:26.902]  This is the attempt to steal the election in front of everybody.
[02:09:26.962 --> 02:09:29.083]  But I've been wanting to get this fellow on for months.
[02:09:29.663 --> 02:09:30.644]  It's an interesting story.
[02:09:32.073 --> 02:09:36.094]  Because it's newsworthy, but it's also a way to support the broadcast.
[02:09:36.734 --> 02:09:41.396]  Because I was talking to some of my family, and I was saying, man, you sure look a lot younger.
[02:09:41.416 --> 02:09:42.636]  And I said, what have you been doing?
[02:09:43.577 --> 02:09:48.658]  And they said, specifically, and I'm not a big, you know, metrosexual type guy.
[02:09:48.678 --> 02:09:50.599]  I'm not into creams and stuff for my face.
[02:09:50.619 --> 02:09:52.259]  But when I do do it, it's amazing.
[02:09:52.579 --> 02:09:53.820]  And I should do it all the time.
[02:09:55.461 --> 02:10:03.548]  It works so well, and so I wanted to get him on because his products and what he's doing are so much different than other products I've seen.
[02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:08.372]  And that's Dr. Vincent Jampapa, who's joining us for much of the hour.
[02:10:08.453 --> 02:10:20.243]  Last segment I'll get into a bunch of other news that we haven't gotten to yet on the geopolitical front, but he is a board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgery, anti-aging medicine, and founding director of Plastic Surgery Center International.
[02:10:20.543 --> 02:10:21.324]  Everybody knows about that.
[02:10:23.601 --> 02:10:31.611]  Jam Papa Institute for Anti-Aging Medical Therapy and the Regenerative Medicine Institute located in Costa Rica.
[02:10:32.312 --> 02:10:36.096]  And he joins us, he's on Twitter at Dr. Jam Papa.
[02:10:36.156 --> 02:10:39.761]  That's D-R-G-I-A-M-P-A-P-A.
[02:10:40.401 --> 02:10:41.483]  He's on with us because
[02:10:44.255 --> 02:10:48.878]  I was talking to family about a year and a half ago and they were telling me, oh man, this stuff's really great.
[02:10:48.958 --> 02:10:51.600]  I put it under my eyes and my bags are gone.
[02:10:52.541 --> 02:10:57.585]  And then I was talking to George Norrie about six months ago and he was saying, man, this stuff's really great.
[02:10:58.105 --> 02:10:59.986]  You ought to, you know, try to get them to be a sponsor.
[02:11:00.067 --> 02:11:01.287]  I said, yeah, I've actually heard of that.
[02:11:01.648 --> 02:11:03.489]  I've seen it like in airplane magazines, you name it.
[02:11:03.849 --> 02:11:05.871]  So yes, it's a sponsor to help fund the broadcast.
[02:11:07.148 --> 02:11:20.139]  But separate from that, ladies and gentlemen, you know, the big reason he's here and the big reason he's joining us is to just go over the facts and go over the science and go over the medicine here for everybody today and talk about really these different
[02:11:21.407 --> 02:11:23.828]  Missing links that are unfolding.
[02:11:24.688 --> 02:11:26.269]  So Doctor, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:11:26.649 --> 02:11:43.255]  Why don't you just tell the listeners some about yourself and your awakening and from all the medical doctor stuff you've done, what got you into what you're doing the last few years because I know it's like number one in areas of Europe and Asia, but just now what you're doing is starting to hit here in the United States.
[02:11:44.784 --> 02:11:48.885]  Sure, it's my pleasure and it's a pleasure to be on here with you and share this information.
[02:11:50.145 --> 02:11:59.608]  As a board-certified plastic surgeon and an anti-aging physician, you know, one of the things people ask me is, well, you're a plastic surgeon, how did you get into the anti-aging field?
[02:11:59.628 --> 02:12:09.870]  And in general, we as plastic surgeons were the first group of physicians anywhere to transplant tissue and to understand what was the underlying biology behind
[02:12:10.772 --> 02:12:12.493]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:32.599 --> 02:12:44.271]  And that turned into four years ago some Nobel Prize nominations for both myself and the team in researching how do cells grow old and how could we reverse cellular aging.
[02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:59.189]  And eventually all of this turned into a look at what could we bring to improve the quality of lives for people in general at a very reasonable price point that really would make a difference in how they age and how they feel and look.
[02:12:59.649 --> 02:13:05.172]  So with that came the research about an oral product that is now being sold globally.
[02:13:05.833 --> 02:13:14.518]  And that product is a very interesting oral product that's taken twice a day that actually is not a vitamin mineral supplement but is actually
[02:13:15.792 --> 02:13:31.389]  Well, one of the first products using virtually all natural ingredients that can actually change the genes in both our stem cells and body cells to either make them more active or less active based upon what we really feel is the state-of-the-art cellular aging.
[02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:37.656]  So those ingredients have actually been taken from nature, which is where we as humans evolved from.
[02:13:37.776 --> 02:13:38.576]  Well, we've launched the website.
[02:14:02.261 --> 02:14:02.381]  We're
[02:14:20.543 --> 02:14:28.405]  Do it live, where I'm gonna put just the product under my eyes, which I haven't done in about a week, so I can do this, and then show people in literally 20 minutes what it does.
[02:14:28.725 --> 02:14:33.806]  That's just one of your products, and then you've got your AM, PM, and we do a lot of our own supplements and research.
[02:14:33.846 --> 02:14:38.147]  We know how cutting edge your stuff is, obviously, and I haven't brought in other sponsors.
[02:14:38.527 --> 02:14:39.508]  Of course, you're not even paying me.
[02:14:39.568 --> 02:14:40.768]  I'm gonna sell your products.
[02:14:41.028 --> 02:14:49.210]  We haven't brought in other partners in the last five, six years, because I haven't found anything that is up to that level, but I mean, I'm just so impressed, but I think,
[02:14:49.890 --> 02:14:54.112]  From research and talking to suppliers, it's that you put a lot of product in the product.
[02:14:54.532 --> 02:15:01.535]  So many people simply do hype, but then don't actually put the expensive product into it, because the average supplement is what, marked up seven times.
[02:15:01.555 --> 02:15:09.958]  I've looked at your supplements, what, maybe 100, 150 times, which is very, very low to be able to do what you do, put the ingredients in, and then fund your world-class organization.
[02:15:09.998 --> 02:15:13.059]  So, I mean, you really mesh with our philosophy of
[02:15:13.419 --> 02:15:16.761]  You know, really giving people high quality ingredients so they get a great response.
[02:15:17.041 --> 02:15:20.243]  The website's InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:15:20.283 --> 02:15:22.304]  We'll put that URL on screen for folks.
[02:15:23.484 --> 02:15:25.165]  Yeah, so if I can make another comment.
[02:15:25.205 --> 02:15:34.470]  These products are being produced by Junass Global and they're a family of products that have been designed to work in synergy with each other.
[02:15:34.490 --> 02:15:40.854]  Unlike many other companies that create products for individual different kind of
[02:15:41.514 --> 02:15:45.599]  For instance, disease process or skin or this or whatever.
[02:15:45.619 --> 02:15:48.922]  These products are all designed to work in synergy.
[02:15:48.982 --> 02:15:59.013]  So as you take one and another and another, you notice that the actual impact and how you're feeling and how you actually look and feel or remember things is dramatically better.
[02:16:02.654 --> 02:16:10.603]  There was some bad news recently for extreme right-wing conspiracy theorist and bath salt spokesmodel Alex Jones.
[02:16:11.304 --> 02:16:16.029]  Because it looks like his website InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[02:16:16.049 --> 02:16:18.372]  Yesterday...
[02:16:20.312 --> 02:16:22.094]  I think Alex Jones is disgusting.
[02:16:22.454 --> 02:16:24.015]  I think the things he says are awful.
[02:16:24.035 --> 02:16:25.196]  He makes me physically sick.
[02:16:25.236 --> 02:16:33.742]  With that being said, he does have the ear of the president, and he has six million people that listen to him, and I would like people out there to know that there is a segment of the population that's drawn to this.
[02:16:33.802 --> 02:16:36.864]  We have a problem in this country, and I would like him to be exposed.
[02:16:37.044 --> 02:16:40.807]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[02:16:41.007 --> 02:16:43.508]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[02:16:43.548 --> 02:16:47.549]  He's one of those guys who believes Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[02:16:47.649 --> 02:16:49.970]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true!
[02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:59.253]  Yesterday, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Spotify all erased most of the posts and videos on their services from Alex Jones.
[02:17:03.086 --> 02:17:03.446]  They're gone.
[02:17:03.826 --> 02:17:04.447]  They're out of there.
[02:17:04.607 --> 02:17:19.915]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers, alleging that these were merely, that these were actors and not real students who had experienced the most horrific thing anyone could possibly imagine.
[02:17:19.955 --> 02:17:21.556]  David Hogg, a day after the event,
[02:17:22.096 --> 02:17:26.877]  I started working for the Democratic Party in Soros, flying around on private jets, being anti-gun spokesperson.
[02:17:27.257 --> 02:17:36.779]  I said he's a PR man, and that he was an actor at the school, part of the drama club, so he's well-spoken, and he's been chosen to be anti-gun.
[02:17:36.819 --> 02:17:39.720]  I said I believe people died, and I believe he's a real student.
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:45.401]  But they misrepresented it and said that I bullied him, and said that nobody died, even though he's a public figure.
[02:17:45.682 --> 02:17:46.742]  I would have a right to say that.
[02:17:46.862 --> 02:17:47.542]  I didn't say that.
[02:17:48.162 --> 02:17:56.809]  When Alex Jones posted the video you described saying that the survivors of the Parkland massacre were crisis actors, that violated our harassment policy.
[02:17:56.829 --> 02:18:08.618]  We have a specific policy that says if you say a well-documented violent attack happened and you use the name or image of survivors or victims of that attack, that is a malicious attack and it violates our policy.
[02:18:08.978 --> 02:18:10.819]  I did not post a video doing that.
[02:18:11.179 --> 02:18:12.260]  It was all over the news.
[02:18:12.581 --> 02:18:13.901]  They had to remove all the strikes.
[02:18:14.682 --> 02:18:19.006]  They were putting strikes on videos that I put up showing what I said that I didn't say it.
[02:18:19.767 --> 02:18:29.416]  And you got your asses kicked because I had InfoWars.com and I had NewsWars.com and I was able to counter and show what I said.
[02:18:29.477 --> 02:18:31.719]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:18:32.455 --> 02:18:39.797]  This is about freedom and our access to information from the sources we as individuals trust and like.
[02:18:39.977 --> 02:18:47.939]  A reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[02:18:47.959 --> 02:18:50.820]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[02:18:51.260 --> 02:18:52.761]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[02:18:53.821 --> 02:18:57.024]  You know, good friends, family... Well, he said CNN's not calling anymore.
[02:18:57.484 --> 02:19:03.509]  And I say, well, you know, tell me if you're so... you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[02:19:03.569 --> 02:19:09.595]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times, and they'll send me a link to some other article saying, you know, paraphrasing what you said.
[02:19:09.615 --> 02:19:12.057]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[02:19:12.457 --> 02:19:16.100]  And when I go find it, I say, well, that's not really what was said here.
[02:19:16.781 --> 02:19:18.522]  Well, then, you know, then there's this back pedal.
[02:19:18.562 --> 02:19:21.905]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[02:19:22.025 --> 02:19:32.313]  Well, it's easy to dismiss concerns about Big Tech's actions, all coordinated, it seems, to shut down Jones, because, of course, he's the media's poster child for conspiracy theories.
[02:19:32.433 --> 02:19:37.577]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:19:37.737 --> 02:19:38.397]  Alex Jones.
[02:19:38.457 --> 02:19:38.858]  Alex Jones.
[02:19:38.918 --> 02:19:39.438]  InfoWars.com.
[02:19:39.718 --> 02:19:40.179]  InfoWars.
[02:19:40.219 --> 02:19:40.559]  Alex Jones.
[02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:43.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:25.763 --> 02:20:27.906]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:27.926 --> 02:20:29.809]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:37.136 --> 02:20:41.139]  Doctor, medical doctor, Vincent Jampapa is our guest.
[02:20:41.219 --> 02:20:43.181]  One of the top surgeons out there.
[02:20:43.201 --> 02:20:44.722]  One of the top plastic surgeons in the world.
[02:20:45.222 --> 02:20:51.047]  You can see right there if you're looking at my little iPhone, InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:20:51.767 --> 02:20:54.069]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:20:54.609 --> 02:20:59.673]  That's where you go if you want to get big discounts on the full spectrum of their products.
[02:21:00.134 --> 02:21:02.976]  That's where you go if you want to support the broadcast and support yourself.
[02:21:03.016 --> 02:21:06.419]  Believe me, people know in five years haven't had another supplement or
[02:21:07.139 --> 02:21:09.501]  You know, a personal wellness company here.
[02:21:09.521 --> 02:21:12.443]  It's just been my own products, but these are so good.
[02:21:12.884 --> 02:21:16.286]  And I've heard about it from family and then from George Norrie and others that I had to get involved.
[02:21:16.767 --> 02:21:17.948]  Infowars, yes.
[02:21:18.208 --> 02:21:19.189]  There's no space in that.
[02:21:19.269 --> 02:21:23.552]  Infowars, yes.com to go look all of this up.
[02:21:24.013 --> 02:21:25.954]  And it is extremely, extremely exciting.
[02:21:26.435 --> 02:21:30.078]  We appreciate the founder of it joining us.
[02:21:30.478 --> 02:21:36.162]  And there's some amazing graphics too that I remember months ago when I wanted to get you on, I was going to have for the show,
[02:21:37.003 --> 02:21:37.183]  Thank you.
[02:22:03.584 --> 02:22:06.046]  Everybody knows I don't sit there and promote.
[02:22:06.886 --> 02:22:08.808]  I've been pitched hundreds of MLM companies.
[02:22:08.828 --> 02:22:09.929]  This is not an MLM company.
[02:22:10.269 --> 02:22:19.456]  But they also have a business model where if you want to be a distributor of it, where you can also then obviously people you get signed up who sell take part in that.
[02:22:19.476 --> 02:22:20.857]  That's just a classic business model.
[02:22:21.137 --> 02:22:26.081]  There's also an opportunity link there when you go to InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:22:27.041 --> 02:22:34.824]  So again, Doctor, let's just get right into it, because I already know your products are the very best out there, and they're so exciting.
[02:22:35.665 --> 02:22:36.785]  What should we start with?
[02:22:37.005 --> 02:22:39.807]  The A.M.P.M., the skin cream, the eye cream?
[02:22:40.127 --> 02:22:51.872]  Because I learned about you, again, over a year ago from skin cream, then I forgot about it, then George Norrie told me about it, then somebody else on the street told me about it, then when I was about to set you up for a guest, I had the producer go, oh my God, I already use that, it's the best stuff out there.
[02:22:52.232 --> 02:22:54.873]  I mean, people don't know, you're already a world leader
[02:22:56.014 --> 02:22:59.196]  In a very short time, because again, you put quality ingredients in.
[02:23:00.597 --> 02:23:06.561]  So yeah, Alex, I think one of the most important things is to understand that human beings, we're made up of cells, right?
[02:23:06.942 --> 02:23:09.444]  There's a hundred trillion cells that make up the human body.
[02:23:09.464 --> 02:23:19.351]  And in our research, we were studying about how can we, if we could figure out how to make just one cell work better, we could use the concepts to make all those hundred trillion cells work better.
[02:23:19.811 --> 02:23:21.833]  So AMPM is a foundation product.
[02:23:21.873 --> 02:23:24.335]  What it does is it actually
[02:23:25.155 --> 02:23:27.557]  It impacts both our body cells and our stem cells.
[02:23:27.597 --> 02:23:30.479]  So let me very briefly describe what stem cells are.
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:39.887]  Because stem cells are our regenerative potential of cells we all have, and they're the ones that go to and fix our body cells as they're damaged or as we age.
[02:23:40.307 --> 02:23:48.393]  And one of the key things is we all are born with a fixed number of stem cells, and that number declines each year, kind of like the gas in your tank of your car.
[02:23:48.793 --> 02:23:54.478]  As you drive that car, you lose gas up, and the quality of that gas also gets worse as you get to the bottom of the tank.
[02:23:55.018 --> 02:24:07.477]  So, AMPM was designed to help maintain the regenerative potential in your body, and then also help maintain your body cells that make up your organs, your skin, your hair, your tissues.
[02:24:08.238 --> 02:24:10.221]  And by taking this compound,
[02:24:10.621 --> 02:24:17.746]  This is the first compound that really focuses on both regenerative potential and ongoing function of your body organs in general.
[02:24:18.207 --> 02:24:24.131]  And it's based on a whole new technique or concept which is way beyond vitamins and minerals.
[02:24:24.471 --> 02:24:27.834]  It's the whole new science of turning gene switches on and off.
[02:24:28.454 --> 02:24:39.086]  And one of the questions I get frequently is, well, how do you know what ingredients to choose or what ingredients to put in a product like this that has 92 different compounds in it?
[02:24:39.607 --> 02:24:47.055]  Well, what we do is we've designed a software program that actually takes into account the latest information genetically on cellular aging.
[02:24:47.575 --> 02:25:08.575]  And then if we know what genes need to be altered up or down to help make your cells work more useful, more optimal, what we do is put that gene information in a software program that searches 300,000 databases over a number of hours, comes back with the latest research on natural ingredients that have been documented
[02:25:08.935 --> 02:25:10.276]  Thank you so much.
[02:25:25.664 --> 02:25:38.390]  Anyway, so this product has not only been designed to do that and been out on the market for a number of years, it has actually impacted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people for the dramatically better.
[02:25:38.430 --> 02:25:44.332]  They sleep better, they feel better, they look better, they don't get as sick as often, their skin quality improves.
[02:25:44.812 --> 02:25:50.815]  So this is a product that works from the inside, the most intimate component of our bodies, ourselves, outward.
[02:25:51.415 --> 02:25:59.644]  And then the other products that are in the Juness line work from the outside in, and that's the topical serums and creams that you had mentioned earlier.
[02:25:59.664 --> 02:26:06.391]  And they also are designed to use key compounds that are normally produced by our stem cells.
[02:26:06.872 --> 02:26:13.179]  Those are packets of DNA, RNA-specific proteins that work on the skin surface, get into the skin.
[02:26:13.699 --> 02:26:32.644]  And in conjunction or synergy with products like ANPM or the other oral products like Reserve or Mind, what we find out is that this combination of working from the inside out and working in synergy with each other has changed the nutritional industry and wellness industry dramatically.
[02:26:33.988 --> 02:26:36.990]  Well, all I know is we've got a great nootropic brain force.
[02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:41.332]  I notice we have some of the same ingredients you have, but you have some others and it's liquid that we don't have.
[02:26:41.812 --> 02:26:45.114]  And I'll just tell you point blank, this is next level.
[02:26:45.554 --> 02:26:48.296]  And a lot of people drink it straight up, but I like to put it on top of ice.
[02:26:49.355 --> 02:26:49.575]  Yeah.
[02:27:06.062 --> 02:27:15.250]  But mind, this big old box of what I've got here, this is something, as much as I work sometimes 18 hours a day, that I am so incredibly excited about.
[02:27:15.710 --> 02:27:23.076]  So spend a few minutes talking about mind that folks can get at InfoWars.com or InfoWarsYES.com.
[02:27:23.096 --> 02:27:25.558]  That's InfoWarsYES.com.
[02:27:25.919 --> 02:27:29.321]  And again, they get a great product for them and their family, and it supports the InfoWars.
[02:27:29.341 --> 02:27:30.743]  People can sign up and become distributors.
[02:27:30.783 --> 02:27:31.543]  I know you get discounts.
[02:27:31.563 --> 02:27:33.325]  I know you're not on about that today, doctor.
[02:27:33.365 --> 02:27:34.546]  You're just the scientist behind it all.
[02:27:35.006 --> 02:27:35.847]  It's just all exciting.
[02:27:35.867 --> 02:27:36.647]  Tell us about MIND.
[02:27:37.567 --> 02:27:37.928]  Sure.
[02:27:37.988 --> 02:27:42.690]  First of all, one of the things I want to bring up is that there's many tablets and capsules on the market.
[02:27:42.810 --> 02:27:54.737]  One of the reasons MIND is in a gel is because the new gel delivery systems make such a difference in efficacy and making those active ingredients, helping them be absorbed through the intestinal lining.
[02:27:55.237 --> 02:28:07.460]  So when you, especially if we're getting older, and I'll bring this point up, because as we get older it's harder to absorb nutrients or ingredients from capsules and tablets because our intestines age too.
[02:28:07.840 --> 02:28:21.404]  So with gel delivery systems, one of the most important things is that the ingredients that we actually use are able to be delivered to the body, okay, so that the body can make use of them for whatever purpose they need.
[02:28:22.621 --> 02:28:27.890]  So let me give you an example of what some of the things that mind has been designed to do, okay?
[02:28:28.270 --> 02:28:30.353]  So we know that the average person...
[02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:34.971]  Has at least 70,000 thoughts per day, okay?
[02:28:35.051 --> 02:28:43.012]  And we also know that the short-term memory for most patients, or people, is approximately seven items for 20 seconds.
[02:28:43.092 --> 02:28:53.635]  Let's explain that when we come back, because yeah, as I've gotten older, my brain still works really good, but once I've had too many thoughts in that day, I get to a point where I can't make the calculations anymore, and that's what you're getting at.
[02:28:53.955 --> 02:28:55.335]  So how do you extend that?
[02:28:55.495 --> 02:29:00.516]  We'll be right back with Dr. Vincent Giampapa, straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[02:29:07.068 --> 02:29:12.211]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[02:29:12.571 --> 02:29:14.592]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[02:29:16.653 --> 02:29:25.638]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts, like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:25.998 --> 02:29:32.242]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time you go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[02:29:33.022 --> 02:29:39.484]  The InfoWars official app integrates some of the most up-to-date news stories, reports, and specials from TheInfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:39.984 --> 02:29:44.765]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[02:29:45.225 --> 02:29:46.205]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:29:46.566 --> 02:29:51.907]  Download the InfoWars official app for tomorrow's news today for free from the Apple Store or Google Play.
[02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:11.674]  Do not believe anyone who says these pills are just spray-painted Mike and Ike!
[02:30:12.235 --> 02:30:13.576]  Cortex Quick!
[02:30:14.216 --> 02:30:19.179]  Thank God they didn't get the formula or they didn't get the jump on us with Ultimate Female Force!
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:25.604]  My beautiful wife had three children one day after she even looked at a bottle of Female Force!
[02:30:25.904 --> 02:30:35.130]  But let me tell you, as Tuck Buckford knows, my cousin, and as I know as well, we came up with the ultimate known herbal formula for your little lady friend.
[02:30:35.410 --> 02:30:37.792]  Popeye turns into a badass when he eats spinach.
[02:30:38.172 --> 02:30:42.676]  My little lady turns into Godzilla when she takes it!
[02:30:42.876 --> 02:31:00.130]  So remember, you can get your ultimate female force today at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com and tell the mainstream media they can go straight to hell as you fund the First Amendment and unlock the incredible dynamo that is your little lady friend.
[02:31:00.350 --> 02:31:01.330]  Whoa!
[02:31:01.391 --> 02:31:01.771]  I love it!
[02:31:03.826 --> 02:31:05.471]  What are champions made of?
[02:31:07.216 --> 02:31:08.359]  Here's a man who can show you.
[02:31:14.878 --> 02:31:15.999]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:31:16.019 --> 02:31:17.180]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:18.381]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:31:18.401 --> 02:31:19.322]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store... Frank!
[02:31:19.402 --> 02:31:21.324]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[02:31:21.424 --> 02:31:22.265]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store...
[02:31:41.141 --> 02:31:44.284]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[02:31:44.604 --> 02:31:47.626]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[02:31:47.646 --> 02:31:49.007]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[02:31:49.027 --> 02:31:49.227]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:31:49.267 --> 02:31:50.148]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:01.837 --> 02:32:09.083]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:32:09.463 --> 02:32:17.010]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:32:17.390 --> 02:32:20.473]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:32:21.093 --> 02:32:25.354]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:32:25.734 --> 02:32:29.655]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:32:29.875 --> 02:32:32.596]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:32:33.016 --> 02:32:37.297]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:32:37.777 --> 02:32:40.818]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:32:41.238 --> 02:32:56.109]  It is so critical that you go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:32:56.329 --> 02:32:57.630]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:32:57.850 --> 02:33:00.332]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[02:33:06.136 --> 02:33:08.758]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.370 --> 02:33:18.871]  We are on the march.
[02:33:19.231 --> 02:33:21.672]  The Empire is on the run.
[02:33:22.413 --> 02:33:26.215]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:29.497 --> 02:33:34.900]  Dr. Vincent Jampapa is one of the top, I mean, look him up, oral surgeons in the world.
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:36.261]  You see him all over television, you name it.
[02:33:36.821 --> 02:33:43.084]  But he's developed a line of body and brain products, and you name it, that are incredible.
[02:33:44.127 --> 02:33:51.855]  I was just talking to one of my crew members, who's already a purchaser, that said, listen, you're supposed to just take the gel like Go-Gurt, you know, when you're talking about Mind from Genoese.
[02:33:52.535 --> 02:33:54.497]  And I'm like, yeah, but I like to mix it with water.
[02:33:54.837 --> 02:34:03.446]  So let me just ask you, doctor, when I'm taking Mind, that I think is my favorite product of yours, everything else is great, is it wrong that I'm putting it in water?
[02:34:03.466 --> 02:34:05.468]  Does that denature it, or is that good or bad?
[02:34:06.240 --> 02:34:07.760]  No, it's perfectly fine to do that.
[02:34:07.800 --> 02:34:15.602]  I mean, don't forget when you put it into your intestines and stomach, you're basically mixing it with the gastric fluids and water anyway, diluting it.
[02:34:15.622 --> 02:34:17.542]  So, if anything, it's not going to hurt it.
[02:34:17.582 --> 02:34:19.843]  It might even help a little bit with absorption as well.
[02:34:20.303 --> 02:34:22.543]  And frankly, we all need to drink more water anyway.
[02:34:22.623 --> 02:34:31.205]  So, I think that's a great thing to do and it's a great refreshing drink and you're just sharper mentally for a good chunk of the day after that.
[02:34:31.765 --> 02:34:33.285]  How did you launch Jeunesse?
[02:34:33.425 --> 02:34:36.006]  Because, I mean, again, all the products are incredible.
[02:34:37.156 --> 02:34:47.182]  So, first of all, Jeunesse is a company that I've been involved as their medical spokesperson and one of their key advisors for product development.
[02:34:47.202 --> 02:34:52.024]  And the family who launched Jeunesse has been very successful in this type of business.
[02:34:52.044 --> 02:34:53.005]  In the past, they've done
[02:34:53.889 --> 02:34:54.570]  Awesome.
[02:35:11.530 --> 02:35:12.550]  Thank you for having me.
[02:35:32.932 --> 02:35:34.214]  Now, we've talked about MIND.
[02:35:34.554 --> 02:35:36.477]  We've also talked about AMPM.
[02:35:36.497 --> 02:35:38.039]  I want to get back into that a little bit more.
[02:35:38.079 --> 02:35:43.606]  They're all available, again, discounted out of the gates at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:35:43.967 --> 02:35:48.993]  And then a part of the purchase you make funds our operation, which everybody knows is so critical.
[02:35:49.033 --> 02:35:50.075]  But again, five years.
[02:35:51.476 --> 02:35:54.318]  You've heard the network and other local stations have their sponsors, and that's great.
[02:35:54.679 --> 02:36:08.971]  Five years since I've had an outside sponsor for supplements or products like this, and I just kept hearing about it from family, friends, George Norrie, who's just about to get involved in it as well, and that's why I'm bringing it to you because I started taking it.
[02:36:09.751 --> 02:36:14.355]  Whether it's the skin cream, or whether it's the AMPM, or whether it's the mind.
[02:36:14.796 --> 02:36:18.819]  And I'm like, wow, this is the only thing out there as good as Infowarslife.com.
[02:36:19.220 --> 02:36:26.666]  And I'll say, I mean quite frankly, before I even launched all this, I've been proprietarily looking and our research shows this is the very best stuff out there.
[02:36:27.147 --> 02:36:33.573]  The problem is with manufacturers and stuff, to get what's in it and to actually get the factories to make it right and to do it,
[02:36:34.393 --> 02:36:39.735]  I don't get anything proprietary, but I know from dealing with it, this is not easy to put products out this good.
[02:36:40.115 --> 02:36:41.456]  That's why people cut the corners.
[02:36:41.476 --> 02:36:42.876]  I mean, is that an accurate statement, doctor?
[02:36:43.556 --> 02:36:46.257]  That's absolutely accurate, and so let me make a comment about that.
[02:36:46.277 --> 02:36:50.239]  You see, it's not only the ingredients, it's the delivery system.
[02:36:50.599 --> 02:36:53.160]  It's how we get those ingredients into your body to be functional.
[02:36:53.340 --> 02:36:54.940]  Because again, it breaks down over time.
[02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:57.241]  So exactly, how do you keep it good in the package till delivery?
[02:36:58.331 --> 02:37:18.124]  Well, again, the packages, for instance, are mine are sealed in a certain fashion, they're vacuum packed, and the capsules on the tablets for AMPM have a special coating on them that keeps them from absorbing any moisture, but also they've been designed to be released inside your body based on the pH they're exposed to.
[02:37:18.464 --> 02:37:24.228]  So the technology in manufacturing goes way beyond what other companies even know about.
[02:37:24.588 --> 02:37:34.605]  So you're looking at a combination of science, technology, manufacturing that result in a product that gets such tremendous impact and, you know, the purpose it's been designed to do.
[02:37:35.782 --> 02:37:42.524]  Well, I'm excited about it, and again, I mean, five years, nobody else we've had on the show, but it's so good.
[02:37:43.044 --> 02:37:45.385]  Let's talk about that whole spectrum.
[02:37:45.625 --> 02:37:48.986]  People on the radio, they want to go to InfoWars.com and link through.
[02:37:49.006 --> 02:37:55.248]  We have some banners up today, but also InfoWarsYes.com, and then they can go there and actually see that map.
[02:37:55.288 --> 02:37:57.989]  You've got that 360 map of the other products.
[02:37:58.009 --> 02:37:58.929]  Let's talk about some of the others.
[02:37:59.749 --> 02:38:00.310]  Sure, absolutely.
[02:38:00.390 --> 02:38:04.671]  For instance, the product called Reserve is also in a gel delivery system.
[02:38:05.638 --> 02:38:09.001]  The Reserve has been designed to do something very, very special.
[02:38:09.382 --> 02:38:11.303]  I don't know of any other products that even do this.
[02:38:11.984 --> 02:38:23.655]  And that only has antioxidants, very concentrated berry extracts for the nutritional value and for self-protection, but it has a special form of resveratrol.
[02:38:24.075 --> 02:38:27.378]  Now, the research we've been doing at different major universities show that
[02:38:27.838 --> 02:38:35.821]  But as we age, we not only lose our stem cells or body cells, but we create bad cells called senescent cells.
[02:38:36.221 --> 02:38:44.684]  Now those cells aren't dividing, they aren't doing anything except for creating, if you will, bad compounds that cause our healthy cells to age even more quickly.
[02:38:45.024 --> 02:38:55.948]  So that has a special resveratrol compound in it that helps turn down the gene or ratchet down the effect of those genes that actually cause these dying or senescent cells.
[02:38:56.588 --> 02:38:57.789]  Which is a big, big help.
[02:38:58.770 --> 02:39:01.032]  So we're looking at, and then the other products work.
[02:39:01.072 --> 02:39:05.615]  For instance, AMPM is your general cellular revitalization product.
[02:39:06.036 --> 02:39:13.802]  MIND is something that we all know, really all of us, especially as professionals, we have to digest a lot of information in this digital age.
[02:39:14.082 --> 02:39:15.383]  Helps dramatically with
[02:39:16.203 --> 02:39:20.924]  Short-term memory, long-term memories, digital recall, symbol recall, word recall.
[02:39:21.324 --> 02:39:25.265]  We need this in today's 21st century rapid world.
[02:39:25.645 --> 02:39:35.628]  Then we look at things topically, for instance, the Luminesce product line has been designed to use, again, the latest science in stem cell technology, that is the packets.
[02:39:35.928 --> 02:39:47.975]  So to be clear, instead of some artificial chemical that manipulates short term, you're just giving the body the building blocks it already needed or the trigger for what was already in you?
[02:39:58.789 --> 02:39:59.250]  Exactly.
[02:39:59.290 --> 02:40:04.075]  In fact, these are things our bodies make when they're young, but they don't continue to make while we're older.
[02:40:04.376 --> 02:40:15.769]  So what we've learned is to mimic what naturally occurs in our bodies and use that in the products rather than putting artificial ingredients and compounds in that in the long run we don't know for sure what they'll do for us.
[02:40:16.349 --> 02:40:16.629]  All right.
[02:40:17.170 --> 02:40:22.493]  Everybody knows that I've been offered, when I say hundreds, probably 500 or more multi-level marketing things.
[02:40:22.513 --> 02:40:25.074]  And I've never gotten involved except with one because they had good products.
[02:40:25.394 --> 02:40:26.535]  And that wasn't their main business.
[02:40:26.555 --> 02:40:32.718]  That was just if people want to be distributors, they want to sign up others and get good products to people and a good sales model, it's good.
[02:40:32.798 --> 02:40:34.219]  Then it's a great business model.
[02:40:34.579 --> 02:40:35.640]  That's classic business model.
[02:40:35.660 --> 02:40:39.142]  You have managers under you and they sell and then you sign them on and you make some money.
[02:40:39.582 --> 02:40:42.464]  But I do want, even though you didn't come on today to talk about this,
[02:40:43.044 --> 02:40:46.346]  If you go to Infowarsyes.com, there's an opportunity button.
[02:40:47.287 --> 02:40:56.814]  Last time I got involved in one of these operations, it went from $14 million to $30-something million to $80 million within just three years that I was involved in.
[02:40:56.874 --> 02:41:00.236]  And everybody admits that I launched it and took it to a top deal.
[02:41:00.296 --> 02:41:01.257]  You guys are already
[02:41:01.977 --> 02:41:19.030]  In the top five, six internationally, for whatever reason, though it's from the U.S., I've noticed when I researched it last year, it took over a year to decide to do this, and you can attest to that, that now it's just about to ramp up here and then just be a great stable product for I think 50, 60 years in the future.
[02:41:19.050 --> 02:41:23.593]  But I believe you're already in the top five, six worldwide of these type of businesses.
[02:41:23.653 --> 02:41:26.075]  I think you're going to go to number one because the products are so good.
[02:41:26.135 --> 02:41:26.696]  That's why
[02:41:27.276 --> 02:41:30.598]  Everybody knows I've stayed out of the Bitcoin, I've stayed out of all that, because it's speculative.
[02:41:30.618 --> 02:41:33.520]  A lot of it's great, but I couldn't tell you that it's a sure thing.
[02:41:34.001 --> 02:41:43.928]  This, at a gut level and a research and a business level, I believe going to InfoWarsYes.com and getting involved with Janesh, I believe is one of the smartest bets out there.
[02:41:44.208 --> 02:41:47.930]  And so I would tell people, I think you should get involved in this as a business, not just as a product.
[02:41:47.950 --> 02:41:48.571]  What do you think, Doctor?
[02:41:49.315 --> 02:42:03.923]  Well, you know what, Alex, I have to agree with you because when I speak about the products and the science behind Geness, I tell everyone, you know, there's very few businesses you can get into where the business helps you stay healthier and more functional.
[02:42:04.283 --> 02:42:09.146]  And every person you meet, you have an opportunity to change their lives for the better.
[02:42:09.606 --> 02:42:10.607]  So to me, this is
[02:42:11.628 --> 02:42:20.155]  One of the most amazing opportunities to not only make a great living, but to live a healthier life and to impact positively the lives of everybody around you.
[02:42:20.175 --> 02:42:21.356]  And to feel great about what you're selling.
[02:42:21.516 --> 02:42:23.337]  Again, why don't I do this?
[02:42:23.377 --> 02:42:25.118]  Because the products aren't good enough.
[02:42:25.479 --> 02:42:30.162]  I finally found a product that I'm not selling that is just good or better than some of the products I'm selling.
[02:42:30.182 --> 02:42:32.664]  And I hate to say that, but I mean, you've knocked it out of the park.
[02:42:32.724 --> 02:42:34.326]  I mean, this is next level, man.
[02:42:34.626 --> 02:42:37.088]  I take mind and it's just like there's nothing else like it.
[02:42:37.828 --> 02:42:39.790]  Uh, and I know you're not really pitching mine here.
[02:42:39.810 --> 02:42:40.771]  You're into the A.M.P.M.
[02:42:40.811 --> 02:42:41.251]  I've taken it.
[02:42:41.311 --> 02:42:41.591]  It's great.
[02:42:41.611 --> 02:42:44.794]  You know, the skincare products, my wife is just insane about them.
[02:42:45.074 --> 02:42:47.637]  She goes and buys this expensive stuff at these, you know, salons.
[02:42:47.937 --> 02:42:49.398]  Here's a third of the price and it's better.
[02:42:49.879 --> 02:42:50.519]  Out of the park.
[02:42:50.979 --> 02:42:53.942]  InfoWarsYes.com and support the InfoWar.
[02:42:54.202 --> 02:42:56.164]  We'll be right back with the doctor.
[02:42:56.584 --> 02:42:57.585]  Straight ahead, Vincent.
[02:42:58.646 --> 02:42:59.507]  Jim, pop up.
[02:43:02.954 --> 02:43:06.537]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[02:43:06.937 --> 02:43:09.380]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[02:43:09.680 --> 02:43:14.044]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[02:43:14.485 --> 02:43:16.386]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[02:44:06.106 --> 02:44:07.488]  Have a wonderful day.
[02:44:07.548 --> 02:44:10.292]  Enjoy your capitalist breakfast.
[02:44:20.667 --> 02:44:22.528]  Are you filming?
[02:44:22.808 --> 02:44:24.489]  This is crazy.
[02:44:25.109 --> 02:44:26.190]  So, ready?
[02:44:26.210 --> 02:44:26.190]  1, 2, 3!
[02:44:26.730 --> 02:44:29.291]  F*** the food fuzzy!
[02:44:29.311 --> 02:44:29.291]  4, 5, 6!
[02:44:30.531 --> 02:44:33.333]  F*** the food fuzzy!
[02:44:33.353 --> 02:44:33.333]  1, 2, 3!
[02:44:34.153 --> 02:44:37.574]  F*** the food fuzzy!
[02:44:37.774 --> 02:44:39.295]  F*** the food fuzzy!
[02:44:49.332 --> 02:44:53.315]  Wait, what sucks about pink government?
[02:44:53.375 --> 02:44:55.856]  Let's talk about that one.
[02:44:55.916 --> 02:44:59.218]  What sucks about pink government?
[02:44:59.558 --> 02:45:04.922]  Isn't the fact that y'all are part of pink government?
[02:45:11.880 --> 02:45:13.601]  What is supremacy?
[02:45:14.002 --> 02:45:15.163]  What is supremacy?
[02:45:15.223 --> 02:45:17.465]  What is supremacy?
[02:45:40.578 --> 02:45:45.684]  They're going to say no more Alex Jones, no more me, no more... Candace Owens they're going after now.
[02:45:46.084 --> 02:45:50.089]  This is a woman who dared to say blacks don't have to be conservative, I mean liberal.
[02:45:50.690 --> 02:45:55.555]  And they're going to end up with much less media, with just state-run media.
[02:45:55.715 --> 02:45:57.618]  Antifa protesters accost conservatives.
[02:45:58.258 --> 02:46:01.481]  Uh, Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens at Philadelphia Cafe.
[02:46:01.841 --> 02:46:09.566]  This happens to me, it happens to Milo, and they literally start screaming Nazi, and then they're screaming at a black woman, screaming, Nazi, Nazi, Nazi!
[02:46:09.766 --> 02:46:11.007]  These people are insane!
[02:46:11.288 --> 02:46:12.188]  Where's it gonna go, Gavin?
[02:46:12.208 --> 02:46:13.989]  Well, and they were, you know what they were screaming?
[02:46:14.050 --> 02:46:20.274]  They were screaming, end white supremacy, and F white supremacy, at a black woman.
[02:46:20.294 --> 02:46:24.237]  And then some of the, the alt-left say, no, no, no, they were screaming at a Charlie Kirk.
[02:46:24.977 --> 02:46:26.838]  Uh, no, they were not screaming at Charlie Kirk.
[02:46:26.878 --> 02:46:36.343]  They had a bullhorn in Candace's face that she had to physically tear away with her hands as they poured water on Charlie Kirk and screamed like hyenas.
[02:46:36.724 --> 02:46:37.944]  You know they're all rich kids.
[02:46:38.545 --> 02:46:40.666]  And, you know what I was thinking the other day?
[02:46:41.126 --> 02:46:42.487]  I'm becoming scared.
[02:46:43.067 --> 02:46:44.288]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:24.915 --> 02:47:31.161]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:33.476 --> 02:47:39.500]  Dr. Vincent Jampapa is our guest, and again, listeners, you know that I've gotten rid of all the sponsors.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:41.981]  Some are great, some the quality goes down.
[02:47:42.001 --> 02:47:46.524]  I mean, I'll be honest when it comes to nutraceuticals, it's an incredible hassle.
[02:47:47.484 --> 02:47:52.227]  One batch of knockout will be so strong that one pill knocks me out and I sleep like I'm dead.
[02:47:52.307 --> 02:48:01.313]  And then one of the latest batches was not as strong and I'm like bitching at him saying this is, you know, but it's herbal, it's natural, so there's no, it's very hard to control it.
[02:48:02.483 --> 02:48:11.270]  But with Janesh and the products that Dr. Vincent Jampapa has produced, I first started talking to them, I said a year, time flies, two years ago.
[02:48:12.892 --> 02:48:19.757]  When I had family taking it and I had crew and I just kept hearing about it, you ought to do this, this is the best, blah, blah, blah, to do that.
[02:48:20.378 --> 02:48:22.379]  And then I talked to their people, then I never did it.
[02:48:24.335 --> 02:48:26.539]  And I finally just went ahead and bit the bullet, okay?
[02:48:26.559 --> 02:48:31.748]  Because it's kind of a weird thing when you're selling your own nutraceuticals and then say, hey, here's this, but I'm a 360 winner.
[02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:35.855]  And so if something's really that good, InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:48:39.884 --> 02:48:41.466]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:48:41.506 --> 02:48:43.908]  It can be lowercase, it can be lowercase.
[02:48:43.948 --> 02:48:45.670]  Just InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:48:46.050 --> 02:48:49.393]  You go there, you get the products at the lowest prices, and it funds the operation.
[02:48:49.714 --> 02:48:55.019]  And again, the data didn't come on about the term they use, MLM, and the media they demonize, all the rest of it.
[02:48:55.479 --> 02:48:57.802]  And a lot of those MLMs are just total BS.
[02:48:58.442 --> 02:49:00.923]  But not this, because that's not even their model.
[02:49:00.963 --> 02:49:01.683]  It's the products.
[02:49:02.003 --> 02:49:05.064]  And then if you want to sell it and want to do it, they have one of the best models out there.
[02:49:05.485 --> 02:49:06.625]  And I'm very, very proud of it.
[02:49:06.685 --> 02:49:08.646]  And I'm involved in it now.
[02:49:09.046 --> 02:49:11.847]  And I think it's going to blow up in the United States.
[02:49:11.887 --> 02:49:12.847]  That's my view of this.
[02:49:13.307 --> 02:49:14.608]  And I've done this one time before.
[02:49:14.628 --> 02:49:15.768]  People have been really successful.
[02:49:15.788 --> 02:49:17.169]  They're very happy now, years later.
[02:49:18.089 --> 02:49:21.030]  And so, again, InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:49:21.170 --> 02:49:23.531]  One word, InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:49:23.551 --> 02:49:26.392]  A few other issues that I'm going to cover after he leaves us.
[02:49:27.731 --> 02:49:30.974]  Trump sentencing of NSA leaker reality winner, so unfair.
[02:49:31.014 --> 02:49:31.854]  Yeah, she's a traitor.
[02:49:31.874 --> 02:49:32.935]  Yeah, she's an SJW.
[02:49:33.215 --> 02:49:34.476]  Compared to Hillary, it's nothing.
[02:49:34.857 --> 02:49:36.258]  That's on Infowars.com.
[02:49:37.439 --> 02:49:43.303]  Alexandria Cortez sides with cab drivers while campaign uses Uber exclusively.
[02:49:43.704 --> 02:49:45.185]  That's an Infowars.com story.
[02:49:45.225 --> 02:49:49.388]  Just the insane hypocrisy of these people is unbelievable.
[02:49:51.650 --> 02:49:55.454]  Jam Papa, just finishing up, I really appreciate your time and what you've done.
[02:49:55.494 --> 02:49:57.175]  You've come up with some amazing products here.
[02:49:57.996 --> 02:50:02.821]  Anything else you'd like to add for the listeners of why you guys are so special in a whole field of great products?
[02:50:02.841 --> 02:50:03.882]  There's a lot of great products out there.
[02:50:03.902 --> 02:50:05.484]  It's just that yours are a cut above.
[02:50:05.844 --> 02:50:07.025]  Again, InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:50:10.257 --> 02:50:17.062]  Why is Ginesh, with your research and with the founders, tutelage?
[02:50:17.742 --> 02:50:22.045]  I mean, I was looking at numbers just four or five months ago meeting with the heads of your team.
[02:50:23.126 --> 02:50:24.647]  We were developing a plan to launch this year.
[02:50:25.447 --> 02:50:26.728]  Which I should have launched a lot earlier.
[02:50:26.748 --> 02:50:28.769]  It's just been tied up with all these attacks.
[02:50:28.829 --> 02:50:37.035]  Everyone knows that like the numbers, I don't want to say I'm wrong, but like almost number one in Asia or number one, already number two or three in Europe and then climbing here.
[02:50:37.516 --> 02:50:39.297]  Why have it started here in America?
[02:50:39.817 --> 02:50:40.138]  Why?
[02:50:40.158 --> 02:50:41.278]  Because you got the latest numbers.
[02:50:41.338 --> 02:50:42.039]  Correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:50:42.379 --> 02:50:45.561]  Why are you so much bigger in Asia and Europe and now only hitting here?
[02:50:45.581 --> 02:50:49.064]  Which is a great opportunity for people that want to be distributors, not just users of it.
[02:50:50.205 --> 02:50:51.726]  Well, I think that's a great question.
[02:50:52.006 --> 02:51:00.390]  Number one, cultures like Asia and Europe are much more receptive to the natural approach to health and aging than we are in the U.S.
[02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:05.013]  And also in the U.S., the concept of what, like you mentioned, MLMs had
[02:51:05.896 --> 02:51:06.356]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:51:29.531 --> 02:51:30.232]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:51:49.927 --> 02:52:06.274]  And with the science and technology behind the product development in Juness, we truly believe, the founders believe, the people who are executive people in this company believe that the science message will really take this company to the next level of where it will definitely be here in the U.S.
[02:52:07.255 --> 02:52:13.257]  And again, I want to be clear, because I've done a year and a half of research before we did this, because I absolutely want the best product for our listeners.
[02:52:13.337 --> 02:52:14.118]  It's a 360 Win.
[02:52:14.138 --> 02:52:16.619]  I mean, it's my whole operating system.
[02:52:17.805 --> 02:52:30.598]  You guys are already an established group of high-quality, top-of-the-line supplements, the latest developments, and then using a direct sales, that's really what it is, model, so people cannot just be users, but also word-of-mouth.
[02:52:30.618 --> 02:52:36.463]  If you're going to tell somebody something's great, why not tell them it's great, and then sign them up, they get a discount, you get a discount, and you make some money.
[02:52:36.844 --> 02:52:39.446]  So, I mean, it's just gut level and everything else.
[02:52:39.506 --> 02:52:39.907]  This is
[02:52:40.727 --> 02:52:46.591]  I think a business model that all of our listeners should look into, they should find out at InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:52:47.031 --> 02:52:47.852]  It's very easy.
[02:52:47.872 --> 02:52:51.975]  And again, you weren't coming on, Doctor, you're the science end, the development end, about this today.
[02:52:51.995 --> 02:52:58.599]  And usually, you know, the other time I've promoted something like this that turned out to be great as well, I was mainly just on the product end.
[02:52:58.639 --> 02:53:08.346]  But I just think up front in something like this, like you said, the invasion of America happening right now with this great product, this great product line, this is something people want to get in on ground floor.
[02:53:10.524 --> 02:53:17.392]  Without a question, and in closing, I'd like to say the line of products that are available are amazing at the moment.
[02:53:17.972 --> 02:53:29.365]  Stay tuned for some of the most amazing things that are going to come down in the next six months to a year from Juness, which will only add to the tremendous credibility and science behind where the company is at the moment.
[02:53:30.023 --> 02:53:31.385]  All right, we got a few minutes till break.
[02:53:31.525 --> 02:53:33.909]  Just again, because I've been interrupting a lot, Doctor.
[02:53:34.530 --> 02:53:43.184]  Again, recap the founding of the company, your involvement, why these products are so game-changing, and again, some of the other family of products that we haven't gotten to.
[02:53:43.962 --> 02:53:44.382]  Sure, sure.
[02:53:44.562 --> 02:53:47.723]  So the company was founded about a little over five years ago.
[02:53:48.163 --> 02:53:55.704]  At that time I was approached by the founders because I was one of the founding physicians of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine.
[02:53:56.164 --> 02:54:06.427]  My focus is on cellular aging and they wanted me to help create a product line along with other physicians who are involved in product development.
[02:54:06.687 --> 02:54:07.347]  But to kind of create
[02:54:08.927 --> 02:54:12.790]  The whole new level of science and credibility based upon cellular aging.
[02:54:13.311 --> 02:54:29.203]  So at that time I was a little hesitant because of the MLM market and the reputations, but I have to say that the founders of this company are some of the most philanthropic and humanistic focused human beings I have ever met.
[02:54:29.763 --> 02:54:31.545]  They are phenomenal people.
[02:54:31.605 --> 02:54:34.407]  They are people who care about people, care about the people.
[02:54:34.427 --> 02:54:37.990]  Well that's obvious because I'm in the business of this and I know how hard it is to put
[02:54:38.610 --> 02:54:42.312]  Actual ingredients and only have a hundred fifty percent markup with all the other cost.
[02:54:42.652 --> 02:54:43.272]  It's very hard.
[02:54:43.312 --> 02:54:44.853]  Everything else is five to seven times.
[02:54:45.333 --> 02:54:48.034]  I know what you guys are doing and I know the products blow me away.
[02:54:48.334 --> 02:54:49.135]  So that's the proof.
[02:54:49.155 --> 02:54:50.615]  Like you said, they're smart.
[02:54:50.635 --> 02:54:54.837]  They're like, let's have something that blows them away and then we're going to have great business anyways.
[02:54:54.857 --> 02:55:02.701]  I don't understand how 90% of supplements out there and nutraceuticals are literally watered down crap and they're nothing but marketing.
[02:55:02.741 --> 02:55:03.721]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:55:04.162 --> 02:55:07.063]  Why not give them a product that works so they buy it forever?
[02:55:08.806 --> 02:55:13.369]  Well, Alex, you hit right on the most important piece of information there.
[02:55:14.829 --> 02:55:17.191]  It's about credibility and good quality products.
[02:55:18.792 --> 02:55:19.692]  Well, yeah.
[02:55:19.852 --> 02:55:26.056]  Why do people want a Mercedes versus a Yugo?
[02:55:26.376 --> 02:55:28.757]  Because they know a Mercedes is going to run better than a Yugo.
[02:55:28.797 --> 02:55:30.538]  I mean, it's because it's got quality.
[02:55:30.578 --> 02:55:36.262]  Why does somebody want... I don't get in the industry why there's so much fly-by-night stuff.
[02:55:36.282 --> 02:55:36.782]  I just don't get it.
[02:55:37.921 --> 02:55:47.919]  Okay so the real issue here is when you buy a product, a nutraceutical product, what makes that product successful, what makes the company successful is experiential
[02:55:49.142 --> 02:55:49.562]  Effect.
[02:55:49.943 --> 02:55:55.988]  If you don't feel the difference or see the difference when you're taking the product, you're very unlikely to continue taking this.
[02:55:56.068 --> 02:56:05.355]  And what UNESCO has has designed are products that people either feel a dramatic difference in their sleep, their energy, their skin looks better, their memory better.
[02:56:05.635 --> 02:56:07.937]  And it's all about experiential impact.
[02:56:07.977 --> 02:56:08.938]  And just like you said,
[02:56:09.558 --> 02:56:17.164]  So many of these other products promise to do, from other companies, products promise to do things that they don't do, and you don't feel or see the difference.
[02:56:17.204 --> 02:56:20.826]  So that's why they're not successful, and that's why Juness is.
[02:56:21.867 --> 02:56:22.387]  Amazing.
[02:56:22.508 --> 02:56:26.270]  I want to get you in studio whenever you want to come to Austin, all right, where we can set up a group to see you, or I can come see you.
[02:56:27.071 --> 02:56:28.352]  Dr. Jan Poppa, great work.
[02:56:28.472 --> 02:56:33.415]  A medical doctor, oral plastic surgeon, so many other types of surgeries he can do.
[02:56:33.736 --> 02:56:34.656]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:56:34.676 --> 02:56:35.417]  We really appreciate you.
[02:56:36.874 --> 02:56:38.537]  My pleasure, Alex, and stay well and healthy.
[02:56:38.858 --> 02:56:39.198]  You bet.
[02:56:39.779 --> 02:56:42.244]  Well, I work 18 hours a day and I'm under a lot of stress, but I'm trying.
[02:56:42.324 --> 02:56:43.707]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:56:44.108 --> 02:56:44.368]  Folks...
[02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:47.629]  We fund our operation with high quality products.
[02:56:47.849 --> 02:56:49.430]  Their stuff has all blown me away.
[02:56:50.011 --> 02:56:51.191]  All of it's so high quality.
[02:56:51.852 --> 02:56:53.533]  From the packaging down to the ingredients.
[02:56:53.693 --> 02:56:57.936]  And if you buy it at InfoWarsYes.com, it'll help fund our operation.
[02:56:57.956 --> 02:57:07.942]  But I'm telling you, if you're wanting a business for women with the skin creams, the eye creams, and all the supplements and the rest of it, this stuff is going to just fly off the shelves.
[02:57:08.002 --> 02:57:10.584]  I can tell you, I know a winner when I see it.
[02:57:12.828 --> 02:57:15.050]  It's just like Brain Force works real great.
[02:57:15.871 --> 02:57:17.732]  Their Mind product works really great.
[02:57:18.533 --> 02:57:21.655]  And that's what I'm looking for, something that gives you a big result.
[02:57:22.036 --> 02:57:26.379]  And then we're able, just like our politics changes the world, our products change the world.
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:28.861]  Anything I'm involved in is TNT.
[02:57:29.782 --> 02:57:31.583]  So, InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:31.663 --> 02:57:32.824]  InfoWarsYes.com.
[02:57:33.384 --> 02:57:39.268]  And I want to invite everybody to go join there, become a distributor, get big discounts, or just be a customer, and try the products.
[02:57:39.288 --> 02:57:47.393]  You have nothing to lose, because you're funding the InfoWar regardless, and Soros is in Hillary's face, and helping get your body really, really healthy.
[02:57:47.413 --> 02:57:48.753]  We'll be right back with political news.
[02:57:48.773 --> 02:57:49.194]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.395 --> 02:57:52.876]  Now!
[02:57:54.857 --> 02:57:56.178]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:57:57.828 --> 02:57:59.908]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:58:00.188 --> 02:58:01.269]  I believe in you!
[02:58:01.689 --> 02:58:02.809]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:58:04.569 --> 02:58:09.410]  One man ever raped a woman, all genitals were cut off!
[02:58:09.650 --> 02:58:12.070]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:58:12.210 --> 02:58:13.411]  And we're not backing down on her!
[02:58:13.431 --> 02:58:16.491]  I wanna get these people!
[02:58:16.531 --> 02:58:17.051]  We're winning!
[02:58:17.111 --> 02:58:18.191]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:58:18.352 --> 02:58:18.832]  Can't you?
[02:58:19.112 --> 02:58:20.732]  We have broken their back!
[02:58:21.112 --> 02:58:22.272]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:58:26.113 --> 02:58:26.673]  Let's go!

[03:00:05.306 --> 03:00:05.906]  Another time.
[03:00:06.146 --> 03:00:07.226]  In the age of wonder.
[03:00:07.326 --> 03:00:08.387]  Another world.
[03:00:08.487 --> 03:00:09.167]  Another time.
[03:00:26.247 --> 03:00:35.091]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:35.812 --> 03:00:41.935]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.582 --> 03:00:49.786]  Joel Gilbert's coming up in the next 50 minutes, and then you got Owen Troyer, Roger Stone with Exclusive News.
[03:00:50.367 --> 03:00:51.487]  You're not gonna get anywhere else.
[03:00:52.608 --> 03:01:00.935]  You know, I look back every day off what we already broke, and like a week later see it being national news, and it's just like, you know, we're not that good.
[03:01:03.537 --> 03:01:08.881]  It's that the mainstream media has all this news, but it's gotta pass it up committees.
[03:01:11.328 --> 03:01:13.291]  To be authorized to put it out later.
[03:01:13.711 --> 03:01:19.860]  And most of the times they wouldn't even put the truth out later if we hadn't broke it or if Drudge Report hadn't broke it.
[03:01:21.242 --> 03:01:25.027]  And that's why they want to shut down so that we can't force those stories out.
[03:01:25.108 --> 03:01:27.251]  That's why Infowars is so precious.
[03:01:29.261 --> 03:01:35.484]  You know, Trump's now hitting on all cylinders, going after them, going after Facebook with antitrust operations, going after them for discrimination.
[03:01:36.004 --> 03:01:38.905]  Says social media giants are silencing millions of people.
[03:01:39.585 --> 03:01:47.849]  Can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear fake news like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely, and CNN policing the end of free speech, so they're even worse.
[03:01:47.869 --> 03:01:50.790]  They're not just fake news, they're mafia.
[03:01:52.170 --> 03:01:55.712]  People have to figure out what's real and what is not without censorship.
[03:01:55.752 --> 03:01:56.632]  Yeah, it's the censors.
[03:01:57.253 --> 03:01:58.093]  That's the real tyranny.
[03:01:59.787 --> 03:02:04.108]  The stories are up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, but here's the thing.
[03:02:05.768 --> 03:02:06.849]  They're making their move right now.
[03:02:06.869 --> 03:02:07.769]  And I keep saying that.
[03:02:07.789 --> 03:02:08.569]  Everybody knows it.
[03:02:09.729 --> 03:02:21.932]  But they wouldn't be doing all this censorship, and they wouldn't be doing all these attacks, and they wouldn't have Silicon Valley meeting in secret today, according to BuzzFeed, about how to censor the Internet, if they didn't know they were losing.
[03:02:22.193 --> 03:02:24.833]  So, I want to be positive, and I want you to know we have the initiative.
[03:02:24.873 --> 03:02:28.054]  We can win if people are awake, if people are involved.
[03:02:29.858 --> 03:02:33.380]  The problem is even the New York Post and the Washington Times are being censored now.
[03:02:34.661 --> 03:02:38.304]  Facebook censors articles from conservative outlets about Manafort and Cohen.
[03:02:38.684 --> 03:02:42.446]  They want only their official story out.
[03:02:44.088 --> 03:02:46.189]  They're making their move, and it's organized crime.
[03:02:46.769 --> 03:02:51.893]  You know, we had a group of Italian-Americans back when J. Edgar Hoover was being blackmailed by the Italian mafia.
[03:02:53.399 --> 03:02:58.041]  And finally, up in upstate New York, a bunch of them were meeting in a barn, and they finally got it documented.
[03:02:58.081 --> 03:02:59.622]  There was such a thing as La Cosa Nostra.
[03:03:00.062 --> 03:03:18.531]  Well, you've got La Cosa Nostra, you've got tech natrosa, you've got the thing of the big tech companies and the big banks engaging in this giant manipulation of culture and society, and it's all right here in front of you to steal the election, to prepare to steal.
[03:03:18.931 --> 03:03:22.453]  This whole headline, tech companies are gathering for a secret meeting to prepare
[03:03:24.448 --> 03:03:29.570]  A 2018 theft of the election strategy.
[03:03:30.210 --> 03:03:31.751]  Or to steal the election strategy.
[03:03:32.171 --> 03:03:32.731]  To steal.
[03:03:32.771 --> 03:03:33.151]  Two words.
[03:03:33.991 --> 03:03:34.531]  To steal.
[03:03:37.532 --> 03:03:38.033]  To steal.
[03:03:39.353 --> 03:03:41.354]  So, this is in your face.
[03:03:42.174 --> 03:03:45.295]  And they have this thing where they hide it in plain view like it's no big deal.
[03:03:47.657 --> 03:03:50.218]  Like a jellyfish, they just come take you over.
[03:03:50.978 --> 03:03:51.738]  And it's amazing.
[03:03:51.778 --> 03:03:55.939]  And now, they're in the news saying Donald Trump better shut up.
[03:03:57.039 --> 03:03:59.819]  And he better roll over and resign or we'll indict his whole family.
[03:03:59.839 --> 03:04:01.620]  Well, we told you that was coming a few days ago.
[03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:05.100]  And if that isn't dangerous thugs, I don't know what is.
[03:04:05.580 --> 03:04:09.441]  And if people don't have an instinct to say no to that, then we've lost our souls.
[03:04:11.822 --> 03:04:13.122]  As for me, I can't back down.
[03:04:13.976 --> 03:04:21.686]  And I sit there and I watch him attack us and try to censor us and I see like a Daily Beast article, oh Jones is crippled after he was taken off YouTube.
[03:04:24.068 --> 03:04:25.170]  All I can do is tell you the truth.
[03:04:25.290 --> 03:04:26.972]  Our core audience is bigger than ever.
[03:04:28.995 --> 03:04:32.018]  But I do, our outreach is somewhat crippled.
[03:04:32.970 --> 03:04:35.491]  And that's what they're really worried about, is the outreach to new people.
[03:04:35.531 --> 03:04:36.691]  That's what really matters, right?
[03:04:37.212 --> 03:04:38.512]  Is waking them up to what's happening.
[03:04:38.832 --> 03:04:40.153]  They don't want us to question things.
[03:04:40.173 --> 03:04:43.074]  They don't want us to... Here in our own echo chamber, InfoWars is bigger than ever.
[03:04:43.114 --> 03:04:44.394]  Hardcore listeners, we love you.
[03:04:44.834 --> 03:04:49.916]  But tell everybody you know about the free app at InfoWars.com forward slash app or the free podcast or send those videos.
[03:04:50.256 --> 03:04:50.916]  InfoWars.com.
[03:04:51.076 --> 03:04:56.758]  And for everybody you know, without you sending out the live audio feed, without you being the bridge, we're gonna lose.
[03:04:57.899 --> 03:04:58.599]  But no, we're winning.
[03:04:58.859 --> 03:04:59.379]  We're winning.
[03:05:00.080 --> 03:05:01.140]  Daily Beast, we're winning.
[03:05:03.004 --> 03:05:06.685]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:05:06.845 --> 03:05:11.906]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:05:12.066 --> 03:05:13.246]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:13.366 --> 03:05:14.986]  It is absolutely free.
[03:05:15.206 --> 03:05:20.187]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:05:20.428 --> 03:05:24.288]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:05:24.368 --> 03:05:28.269]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.

[03:05:37.293 --> 03:05:38.414]  We have huge specials.

[03:05:42.476 --> 03:05:46.919]  New t-shirts at the InfoWars store as well, including one that I just got.
[03:05:47.340 --> 03:05:49.921]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[03:05:50.101 --> 03:05:58.187]  Very, very cool logo and kind of more discreet so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[03:05:58.467 --> 03:06:01.309]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:01.349 --> 03:06:02.790]  Huge discount store-wide right now.
[03:06:14.312 --> 03:06:18.253]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:18.693 --> 03:06:21.014]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:06:39.471 --> 03:06:46.755]  All right, Joel Gilbert's got a raft of important guests dealing with the deplatforming of Christians, conservatives, libertarians, pro-Israel folks, you name it.
[03:06:46.795 --> 03:06:52.317]  I don't care if you're the KKK or pro-Israel or a Christian or a Muslim, you shouldn't have your right to free speech taken.
[03:06:52.758 --> 03:06:55.879]  So Joel Gilbert, investigative journalist, documentary filmmaker, is about to take over.
[03:06:56.320 --> 03:07:02.623]  But just illustrating what I was covering earlier, InfoWars said YouTube ban would make it stronger.
[03:07:03.783 --> 03:07:04.983]  Actually, it's been crushed.
[03:07:05.063 --> 03:07:07.564]  Well, we didn't say it would make us stronger.
[03:07:08.164 --> 03:07:09.325]  We don't want to be banned.
[03:07:09.345 --> 03:07:10.585]  We don't want to be depersoned.
[03:07:11.345 --> 03:07:13.566]  We don't want to be taken off 20-something platforms.
[03:07:14.726 --> 03:07:23.169]  But for total raw listeners to InfoWars.com and people actually visiting us and every other metric, yes, the hardcore fans are more energized than ever.
[03:07:23.889 --> 03:07:27.390]  But this, let me just give you a real report, because you guys are the father of lies.
[03:07:27.430 --> 03:07:28.150]  I try to tell the truth.
[03:07:31.283 --> 03:07:34.144]  InfoWars has never had more grassroots support.
[03:07:34.444 --> 03:07:36.224]  I've never gone on the street and had more support.
[03:07:37.184 --> 03:07:53.528]  But kicking me off Apple, and Google, and YouTube, and Facebook, and Stitcher, and Spotify, and WebChimp so I can't send emails, and just discuss, thousands of comments, hundreds of comments on InfoWars.
[03:07:53.848 --> 03:07:55.488]  I mean, yeah, no, it's been a crippling attack.
[03:07:57.045 --> 03:08:02.048]  It's blown up in your face, people see you're a bunch of tyrants, but individually it's not a fun road to go down.
[03:08:02.068 --> 03:08:08.492]  They've taken a payment processor from us, now they've done it to David Horowitz, they've done it to Jihad Watch.
[03:08:08.572 --> 03:08:09.653]  I mean, this is serious.
[03:08:11.414 --> 03:08:13.555]  Nobody's trying to stop Antifa from what they're doing.
[03:08:13.635 --> 03:08:19.399]  So this is ahead of trying to steal the election, ahead of trying to indict enough Trump family members that he rolls over.
[03:08:19.439 --> 03:08:20.139]  That's where we've reached.
[03:08:20.159 --> 03:08:22.241]  But you read this article, none of it's true.
[03:08:24.991 --> 03:08:28.773]  You know, Jones, now that he's only on Twitter, doesn't have more traffic on Twitter.
[03:08:30.013 --> 03:08:32.875]  No, our traffic's about five times what it used to be on Twitter.
[03:08:34.196 --> 03:08:40.359]  But don't worry, they're trying to ban that right now, and Jack Dorsey is meeting, reportedly in secret, to ban us.
[03:08:41.499 --> 03:08:43.400]  So I don't sit there and live and die by that.
[03:08:43.460 --> 03:08:53.085]  If I lived and died by having platforms, I would go along with you and I'd be for Islamic invasion, Black Lives Matter, open borders, world government, tax exemption for big banks.
[03:08:55.347 --> 03:08:58.768]  See, I'm trying to change the world, not be part of it.
[03:08:59.088 --> 03:09:01.609]  So if I wanted to be one of you guys, I'd be at the top.
[03:09:02.650 --> 03:09:03.110]  At the top!
[03:09:04.250 --> 03:09:05.390]  I was offered the deals years ago.
[03:09:05.410 --> 03:09:06.511]  15 years ago.
[03:09:06.531 --> 03:09:08.291]  11 years ago.
[03:09:09.272 --> 03:09:10.012]  And look what we've built.
[03:09:10.592 --> 03:09:12.893]  The proof that they knew, you know, that's talent.
[03:09:13.013 --> 03:09:13.633]  Get that guy.
[03:09:14.013 --> 03:09:14.794]  That guy's a natural.
[03:09:15.034 --> 03:09:15.354]  Get him.
[03:09:15.394 --> 03:09:15.654]  Get him.
[03:09:15.694 --> 03:09:15.914]  Get him.
[03:09:16.214 --> 03:09:17.775]  Well, it didn't work because I'm pro-America.
[03:09:17.815 --> 03:09:18.495]  I'm pro-free market.
[03:09:19.744 --> 03:09:22.245]  So you read this thing where they're like, oh, he's losing.
[03:09:22.285 --> 03:09:25.486]  I'm not going to sit there and be overconfident and say, oh, I'm totally winning.
[03:09:25.526 --> 03:09:26.246]  Everything's wonderful.
[03:09:26.286 --> 03:09:26.907]  It's a walk in the park.
[03:09:26.927 --> 03:09:31.788]  But no, we overall are stronger than ever because our audience is stronger than ever.
[03:09:31.808 --> 03:09:33.789]  And they realize how real this is and how serious it is.
[03:09:33.809 --> 03:09:35.490]  But here's where we're getting hurt in outreach.
[03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:38.831]  They don't want us on Facebook and YouTube.
[03:09:42.859 --> 03:09:50.162]  Can tune in and hear, hey, Obama had 84 million in weird campaign funds they couldn't list and only got a fine.
[03:09:50.702 --> 03:09:51.923]  Hey, Hillary had the seat.
[03:09:51.943 --> 03:09:58.365]  They don't want that being reminded and they don't want big events coming or have our own reporters on the ground showing Antifa beating up old ladies.
[03:10:00.386 --> 03:10:01.386]  But they can't stop.
[03:10:02.767 --> 03:10:04.768]  Conservatively, there's probably
[03:10:06.161 --> 03:10:07.465]  Million and a half people tuned in.
[03:10:07.565 --> 03:10:11.075]  People have only tuned in for like 20 minutes, but it's over a million people over 15 minutes.
[03:10:11.456 --> 03:10:13.843]  So let's say there's a million and a half people tuned in right now.
[03:10:15.539 --> 03:10:17.341]  70% in the U.S., 30% around the world.
[03:10:17.882 --> 03:10:27.432]  No one can stop you going out your front door and telling your wife, your husband, your neighbor, your friend, your boss, your employees, your church, on Facebook, on Twitter, but in person.
[03:10:27.532 --> 03:10:28.634]  Infowars.com.
[03:10:28.774 --> 03:10:29.715]  It is the verboten.
[03:10:30.195 --> 03:10:30.916]  It is the hidden.
[03:10:31.056 --> 03:10:32.037]  It is what they're attacking.
[03:10:32.398 --> 03:10:36.862]  The power of you, outside of cyberspace, the establishment's betting everything on.
[03:10:37.728 --> 03:10:43.513]  By word of mouth saying InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, or sharing the videos on our own platforms.
[03:10:43.533 --> 03:10:48.857]  You know, they brag and go, oh all they've got is real video now and we're gonna shut it down, you know.
[03:10:49.197 --> 03:10:51.699]  We already had real video getting set up knowing this was coming.
[03:10:52.159 --> 03:10:53.240]  Didn't mean we wanted it to happen.
[03:10:54.101 --> 03:10:56.022]  And you know, my average video on there has like 5,000 views.
[03:10:56.663 --> 03:10:58.324]  Is that my average 100,000 on YouTube?
[03:10:58.364 --> 03:10:59.325]  No, but it doesn't matter.
[03:10:59.886 --> 03:11:00.786]  It's the truth.
[03:11:01.607 --> 03:11:03.188]  And we're on hundreds of other platforms.
[03:11:05.236 --> 03:11:07.857]  You know, Joe Rogan, and then I'll hand the baton to our guest host.
[03:11:09.598 --> 03:11:14.440]  He did this video that I want to respond to later, because I know Joe so well since like the late 90s.
[03:11:15.760 --> 03:11:19.582]  He's like, well, since Alex is in litigation, we're not going to have him on until he's out of litigation.
[03:11:20.482 --> 03:11:28.085]  When Anna Vetti and Obama and all these people are in litigation, you just don't have me on about the litigation.
[03:11:28.125 --> 03:11:29.726]  But that cop-out, no, Joe Rogan,
[03:11:31.317 --> 03:11:36.899]  Says I'm not having you on my show because he's afraid of being de-platformed off of one of these things like iTunes or Google.
[03:11:36.979 --> 03:11:40.880]  That's the real message is, you shut up about America and free market.
[03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:45.822]  You sit there in the dirt and you let us steal the election and you roll over or we'll de-platform you.
[03:11:46.142 --> 03:11:50.744]  You be good little lap dogs and you sit there and say and hear what we want on the news.
[03:11:51.664 --> 03:12:01.414]  And you go along with this, and you go along with all the tyranny, and you go along with the open borders, and you go along with all of it, and we'll let you still be on iTunes.
[03:12:02.895 --> 03:12:07.420]  And that's why Joe's got one of the biggest podcasts on iTunes or YouTube, because they don't shadow ban him.
[03:12:08.341 --> 03:12:10.923]  I mean, hell, Joe has a video with 5 million, he thinks it's big.
[03:12:11.264 --> 03:12:13.466]  We had videos during the election with 35, 40, 50 million views.
[03:12:15.751 --> 03:12:17.053]  And then they shadow-bandard us.
[03:12:17.673 --> 03:12:21.478]  So, see, I was already 400 laps ahead of Joe.
[03:12:21.578 --> 03:12:23.000]  Not that I count that as something.
[03:12:23.580 --> 03:12:29.908]  So, Joe thinks, though, well, if he compromises with the system, he'll get to be in pole position.
[03:12:29.988 --> 03:12:34.533]  But if you're in a race car race and the best people aren't driving, you didn't really win the trophy.
[03:12:35.034 --> 03:12:36.035]  You don't really get the champagne.
[03:12:38.857 --> 03:12:40.138]  And again, I'm not mad at Joe.
[03:12:40.919 --> 03:12:41.979]  It's not an attack on Joe.
[03:12:43.060 --> 03:12:49.305]  So the Souter Jennings interview, I got called by one of his best friends and told, yeah, Joe's family got threatened not to have you on like a year ago.
[03:12:49.685 --> 03:12:51.086]  I said, I heard Joe's family got threatened.
[03:12:51.107 --> 03:12:55.430]  And Joe goes, well, Jones lied and said that my family was threatened when it wasn't.
[03:12:56.070 --> 03:12:58.252]  Well, no, I was told by one of your best friends that.
[03:12:59.233 --> 03:13:01.034]  And then when you said it wasn't true, I said, OK, it's not true.
[03:13:01.054 --> 03:13:03.216]  But whatever, Joe, your family wasn't threatened.
[03:13:03.636 --> 03:13:04.717]  Your views were threatened.
[03:13:04.757 --> 03:13:05.698]  So if you're not a threat,
[03:13:07.295 --> 03:13:11.698]  They're just going to stick you up there on everything and you can be what they force feed to everybody.
[03:13:12.378 --> 03:13:14.179]  But then the comments are almost all against you.
[03:13:14.739 --> 03:13:17.581]  Which is just sad because I think I've bet on humanity.
[03:13:17.941 --> 03:13:19.722]  I think I've bet on the winners like Trump has.
[03:13:19.782 --> 03:13:27.026]  I think the prosperity and the freedom and people are going to see past all this globalism and see past Mueller and all his fake indictments and all the persecution.
[03:13:27.387 --> 03:13:28.307]  I'm believing in humanity.
[03:13:28.367 --> 03:13:32.089]  And Joe, you're this blue collar guy from Boston, you know, former Taekwondo champion.
[03:13:32.109 --> 03:13:33.130]  You're a tough guy on your own, right?
[03:13:34.175 --> 03:13:37.697]  But at 50-something years old, I mean, I think you're trying to bet on the safe horse.
[03:13:37.737 --> 03:13:40.359]  But I think that leads towards stagnation, Joe.
[03:13:41.460 --> 03:13:42.460]  I'm not going to play the clips.
[03:13:42.780 --> 03:13:45.182]  Maybe at the end of this, I'm going to let Joe Gilbert take over.
[03:13:45.202 --> 03:13:48.664]  Maybe at the end of this live piece, we'll put a few clips, you know, of Joe.
[03:13:49.104 --> 03:13:51.186]  Got to bleep it a lot with Shooter Jennings, who stood up for him.
[03:13:51.206 --> 03:13:51.946]  We appreciate Shooter.
[03:13:52.666 --> 03:13:54.548]  If we hadn't had Shooter on a year, we should get him back on.
[03:13:54.568 --> 03:13:59.311]  And it's just watching that when I'd already told Joe, look, I don't need to come on.
[03:13:59.351 --> 03:13:59.731]  It's fine.
[03:14:00.151 --> 03:14:02.032]  I understand you're afraid of getting deplatformed.
[03:14:02.452 --> 03:14:03.213]  Other people aren't.
[03:14:03.493 --> 03:14:04.954]  This is the hill people should die on.
[03:14:05.134 --> 03:14:07.015]  Because if they get away with this, they're going to shut everybody down.
[03:14:07.055 --> 03:14:07.975]  PewDiePie gets it.
[03:14:08.335 --> 03:14:09.316]  Everybody gets it.
[03:14:09.636 --> 03:14:10.977]  PewDiePie is the number one podcaster.
[03:14:11.397 --> 03:14:13.458]  He's got 20 million views on YouTube.
[03:14:13.478 --> 03:14:14.799]  He's got 65 million subscribers.
[03:14:15.119 --> 03:14:15.919]  He's number one.
[03:14:16.980 --> 03:14:19.241]  And we're talking to him.
[03:14:20.302 --> 03:14:24.084]  Because he understands this is a thing that's coming for all of us.
[03:14:25.609 --> 03:14:33.277]  Just seeing that, no Joe, I didn't lie about your best friend telling me that you said you were threatened and so you couldn't have me on the air anymore.
[03:14:33.658 --> 03:14:44.390]  It's not like, I turned down a bunch of radio interviews and turned on national TV interviews with tens of millions of viewers, but I did want to come on there because you're my friend and I did want to set the record straight because I keep hearing you repeat
[03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:47.131]  Jones says nobody died at Sandy Hook, and Jones says this.
[03:14:47.171 --> 03:14:50.993]  I'm like, Joe, for years I haven't said that, and before I didn't, it's out of context.
[03:14:51.013 --> 03:14:51.774]  I'd like to clarify.
[03:14:52.014 --> 03:14:55.455]  Hey, Joe, you know I'm not really saying that, but Joe keeps repeating it.
[03:14:55.495 --> 03:14:57.536]  So Joe knows that's not what I'm saying.
[03:14:57.737 --> 03:14:59.037]  But I get it, it's the party line.
[03:15:00.538 --> 03:15:04.480]  It's the party line of, Jones did this, Jones did that, so Jones can't be on air.
[03:15:04.540 --> 03:15:05.080]  All these U.S.
[03:15:05.100 --> 03:15:07.842]  Senators threatening the Democrats, threatening the big tech.
[03:15:08.857 --> 03:15:12.759]  Get behind us and censorship or we'll nationalize you when Trump loses.
[03:15:13.219 --> 03:15:14.439]  This is really un-American.
[03:15:14.479 --> 03:15:15.500]  It's really, really dangerous.
[03:15:15.680 --> 03:15:22.703]  And that's why NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com and what we do at InfoWars.com forward slash show, we can hear real information.
[03:15:22.723 --> 03:15:24.684]  We're not going to compromise because that's the plan.
[03:15:25.044 --> 03:15:30.206]  We're going to go to break and come back with Joel Gilbert, but InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[03:15:30.346 --> 03:15:33.808]  They put that story on screen, put it back up from Reason Magazine three weeks ago.
[03:15:34.928 --> 03:15:38.151]  That the Democrat plan to totally censor the web, now it's a public plan.
[03:15:38.691 --> 03:15:41.493]  And most people see that and they go, well, let me be yellow-bellied.
[03:15:41.933 --> 03:15:44.595]  Let me roll over and piss myself immediately.
[03:15:46.157 --> 03:15:48.038]  But I'll tell you this, Steven Crowder didn't piss himself.
[03:15:48.398 --> 03:15:50.280]  He's been defending me and saying what happened to me is wrong.
[03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:53.562]  So good job to Paul Watson and Steven Crowder and Matt Drudge and others.
[03:15:53.622 --> 03:15:56.684]  And to Joe, hey, you've chosen the side you're on.
[03:15:57.025 --> 03:15:58.386]  I say enjoy yourself.
[03:15:58.826 --> 03:15:59.847]  Enjoy George Soros.
[03:16:02.520 --> 03:16:04.381]  Remember the old days of the internet?
[03:16:05.382 --> 03:16:08.644]  When we communicated with each other directly email to email?
[03:16:09.945 --> 03:16:10.785]  You've got mail!
[03:16:11.366 --> 03:16:17.329]  But then Google came along and said, we've got Gmail, why it's free, but of course we read what you say and what you do.
[03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:23.974]  And then now more and more, these big globalist companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, if they don't like you, they simply ban you.
[03:16:24.774 --> 03:16:29.077]  And of course, if you're a conservative, they just list you as a Nazi.
[03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:31.619]  That's right, the entire Republican Party of California.
[03:16:32.459 --> 03:16:37.487]  Ladies and gentlemen, these platforms were useful for us to reach each other while they were still somewhat open and free.
[03:16:38.168 --> 03:16:41.654]  But the big monopoly companies only did this to consolidate the market.
[03:16:42.135 --> 03:16:47.243]  Now they're using that monopoly power, like all monopolies do, to abuse the general public.
[03:16:47.803 --> 03:16:56.169]  That's why it's more important than ever that you visit NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com themselves so the globalists can't censor you as easily.
[03:16:56.330 --> 03:16:57.851]  But just as important is email.
[03:16:58.251 --> 03:16:59.912]  We need to be able to talk to you directly.
[03:17:00.253 --> 03:17:06.077]  That's why it's critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for a free newsletter.
[03:17:06.557 --> 03:17:12.660]  Also, under every article at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, you can see a little sign-up box.
[03:17:12.920 --> 03:17:13.780]  It's absolutely free.
[03:17:14.220 --> 03:17:21.483]  And that way, no matter what happens, we can send you articles, videos, special coupon codes for the shopping cart, you name it.
[03:17:22.024 --> 03:17:29.527]  It is now absolutely essential, according to all the Internet experts I talk to, that everybody start going back more and more
[03:17:30.027 --> 03:17:30.547]  I think?
[03:17:54.515 --> 03:17:54.735]  Sure.
[03:18:24.275 --> 03:18:24.675]  We're good.
[03:18:39.121 --> 03:18:41.382]  We're all pulling for the same mission.
[03:18:41.562 --> 03:18:42.262]  Americana.
[03:18:42.942 --> 03:18:43.822]  Lower taxes.
[03:18:44.082 --> 03:18:44.882]  Second Amendment.
[03:18:45.102 --> 03:18:45.943]  Religious freedom.
[03:18:46.523 --> 03:18:47.443]  Family values.
[03:18:47.483 --> 03:18:48.383]  And it's happening.
[03:18:48.723 --> 03:18:51.724]  But we aren't able to communicate with each other person to person.
[03:18:52.224 --> 03:18:52.824]  Peer to peer.
[03:18:53.524 --> 03:18:56.345]  On these platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google.
[03:18:56.385 --> 03:18:57.005]  All of it.
[03:18:57.025 --> 03:18:58.745]  More and more that's being censored.
[03:18:58.785 --> 03:19:00.826]  The shadow bands have gone to outright bands.
[03:19:01.952 --> 03:19:04.293]  And yes, we're going to try to reform these institutions.
[03:19:04.313 --> 03:19:05.293]  We're going to try to break them up.
[03:19:05.473 --> 03:19:08.374]  That's the whole process starting with congressional hearings in Congress right now.
[03:19:08.715 --> 03:19:22.560]  But during this long, hard battle, it's more important than ever that patrons, Christians, nationalists, people that are populist, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, be able to communicate with each other and realize the importance of email.
[03:19:23.480 --> 03:19:28.444]  I personally get sick of email and I feel full of spam, especially with my older email addresses.
[03:19:28.964 --> 03:19:34.488]  That's why, with Friends and Family, I have private email that only Friends and Family have.
[03:19:35.529 --> 03:19:46.056]  I again suggest that everybody go to mfulwars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can send you direct videos, direct articles, and bypass the system.
[03:19:46.136 --> 03:19:52.681]  And yes, send you special coupon codes and other deals that are the very best we offer from mfulwarsstore.com.
[03:19:53.241 --> 03:19:55.782]  Again, my friends, thank you for joining us in the InfoWar.
[03:19:55.822 --> 03:19:57.042]  We're winning thanks to you.
[03:19:57.122 --> 03:19:57.542]  God bless.
[03:19:57.582 --> 03:20:00.023]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.667 --> 03:20:34.170]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:20:35.151 --> 03:20:39.052]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:39.533 --> 03:20:43.334]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:20:43.675 --> 03:20:45.315]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:45.775 --> 03:20:51.158]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[03:20:53.664 --> 03:20:55.445]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:55.645 --> 03:21:01.088]  I'm Joel Gilbert, your host for this hour, coming to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:21:01.949 --> 03:21:03.570]  You know me as a frequent guest of Alex.
[03:21:03.670 --> 03:21:09.593]  Also, don't forget to get my latest film, Trump the Art of the Insult, in the Alex Jones Store.
[03:21:09.633 --> 03:21:10.634]  Support Alex Jones.
[03:21:12.175 --> 03:21:13.656]  My guest this hour is the
[03:21:14.591 --> 03:21:19.173]  First of all, we'll have Kevin Jackson up in the last segment, but we're going to start with Jack Cashill.
[03:21:19.233 --> 03:21:33.958]  Jack is a journalist who's written many fascinating books, including Deconstructing Obama, Ron Brown's Body, Silence, TWA 800, and If I Had a Son, Guns, Railroading of George Zimmerman.
[03:21:34.478 --> 03:21:36.559]  It's all about a Trayvon Martin case.
[03:21:37.359 --> 03:21:39.100]  Now, we'll be taking your calls at 877-789-7000.
[03:21:42.642 --> 03:21:44.003]  2539, that's 877-789-ALEX.
[03:21:44.043 --> 03:21:48.987]  So, let me go ahead and welcome Jack Cashill.
[03:21:49.047 --> 03:21:49.847]  Jack, are you with us?
[03:21:50.628 --> 03:21:51.248]  Yes, I am.
[03:21:51.509 --> 03:21:52.849]  Thanks, Joel, for having me on the show.
[03:21:53.130 --> 03:21:54.571]  Always appreciate it.
[03:21:55.491 --> 03:21:55.992]  Fantastic.
[03:21:56.032 --> 03:22:05.618]  Well, Jack, you've seen big tech censored Alex Jones, and you wrote a fantastic piece for American Thinker called, First They Came for Alex Jones.
[03:22:06.359 --> 03:22:10.041]  Now, within days, they came for David Horowitz and his Freedom Center.
[03:22:11.269 --> 03:22:13.970]  Took him off of a Visa and MasterCard.
[03:22:15.090 --> 03:22:22.033]  And we've seen this phenomenon where during the Obama years we had government censorship, where they used the tools of state.
[03:22:22.053 --> 03:22:28.796]  The IRS was used to decimate the Tea Party, break up the Tea Party movement so they could win the 2012 election.
[03:22:29.636 --> 03:22:33.177]  The FEC, Federal Election Commission, was used against me, yours truly.
[03:22:34.138 --> 03:22:37.439]  They investigated me for the film Dreams for My Real Father.
[03:22:38.115 --> 03:22:51.142]  Now we've seen that the government leftist control has shifted to the leftist agenda in the private sector to try to gain censorship, starting with, of course, Alex Jones.
[03:22:52.443 --> 03:22:55.244]  Why does the left need to censor their opposition?
[03:22:55.284 --> 03:23:01.828]  Why don't they just make their superior arguments that socialism is a better organizing force for society?
[03:23:02.765 --> 03:23:04.806]  Well, if they had superior arguments, they could make them.
[03:23:04.826 --> 03:23:06.307]  But as you know, they don't.
[03:23:06.367 --> 03:23:17.632]  And, you know, we've seen cases in my own, just in my own experience, Joel, because I've worked with various people who've been punished by the government for reporting the truth.
[03:23:18.292 --> 03:23:19.553]  And this goes back some time.
[03:23:19.613 --> 03:23:27.877]  As I mentioned in the article, I, you know, I first started working with James Sanders on the TWA Flight 800 investigation after I met his wife.
[03:23:28.450 --> 03:23:46.227]  Who is a really, you know, sweet, pretty Filipina TWA trainer who was arrested and convicted of conspiracy for introducing her husband, who is an investigative reporter, to the 747 manager working on the 800 investigation.
[03:23:46.627 --> 03:23:48.669]  This was the crash off Coastal Island in 1996.
[03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.270]  And, um,
[03:23:52.549 --> 03:23:54.370]  All three of them were arrested by the FBI.
[03:23:54.791 --> 03:23:56.032]  The Sanders were convicted.
[03:23:56.452 --> 03:23:59.014]  Sent to, you know, they didn't want to send them to prison.
[03:23:59.034 --> 03:23:59.955]  That would be too obvious.
[03:24:00.595 --> 03:24:06.339]  So they just silenced them by giving Jim, an investigative reporter, five years of probation and his wife, three.
[03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:08.121]  That's just where it started.
[03:24:08.681 --> 03:24:15.386]  A more recent case was David Daleiden of the Center for Medical Progress.
[03:24:15.506 --> 03:24:20.190]  In 2015, after a couple years of work, he and his, how do you know, he and his partners,
[03:24:20.911 --> 03:24:28.217]  surfaced these videos, undercover videos, of Planned Parenthood selling, marketing baby parts.
[03:24:28.678 --> 03:24:29.579]  It was grotesque.
[03:24:29.979 --> 03:24:32.982]  The videos were undeniable.
[03:24:33.522 --> 03:24:36.605]  Hillary Clinton found them disturbing, you know.
[03:24:36.625 --> 03:24:37.525]  She admitted that.
[03:24:38.366 --> 03:24:42.550]  They could not be allowed to be out there, so they had to lie to the press.
[03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:46.886]  You know, those are cases when the left, when Obama was in control.
[03:24:46.986 --> 03:24:55.659]  What about this phenomenon of big tech, the private sector, Visa, MasterCard, Twitter, now taking on that leftist mantra for censorship?
[03:24:55.819 --> 03:24:57.141]  Tell us about this phenomenon.
[03:24:57.221 --> 03:24:58.543]  Why and how is that happening?
[03:24:59.389 --> 03:25:18.623]  Well, you know, it's interesting because one of the people I've gotten to know and I've worked with who was also arrested, James O'Keefe, for Project Vermitas, he exposed this about nine months ago where they went undercover at Twitter and they had all these people bragging on camera how they could use Twitter to basically censor the right.
[03:25:18.663 --> 03:25:19.344]  And they were doing it.
[03:25:19.764 --> 03:25:23.247]  That was the first time we learned about the phrase shadow banning.
[03:25:24.293 --> 03:25:36.224]  And now they've gotten more, you know, aggressive with it, as we saw in the case of Alex Jones, where they openly colluded, you know, Spotify, YouTube, whoever else was involved, Facebook, to take him off.
[03:25:37.325 --> 03:25:45.532]  And they couldn't use the fact that the argument, they couldn't use the argument that he was a white supremacist or, you know, a hate monger.
[03:25:46.093 --> 03:25:48.395]  So they had to say that he was a conspiracy theorist.
[03:25:48.803 --> 03:25:55.007]  But today, conspiracy theorists is the word that we used to use for journalists 30 years ago.
[03:25:55.648 --> 03:25:57.889]  A conspiracy theorist today is the one who tells the truth.
[03:25:58.370 --> 03:25:59.871]  It's a really dangerous precedent.
[03:26:00.291 --> 03:26:03.033]  They can argue that they're private concerns, blah, blah, blah.
[03:26:03.433 --> 03:26:05.454]  But that doesn't really carry water anymore.
[03:26:05.494 --> 03:26:07.796]  They are very close to a public utility.
[03:26:07.856 --> 03:26:09.137]  I don't think they should be regulated.
[03:26:09.870 --> 03:26:11.892]  But they should be protested mightily.
[03:26:12.412 --> 03:26:15.295]  And the people on the right should stand up.
[03:26:15.355 --> 03:26:18.598]  I don't care if they like Alex Jones or not, because they could be next.
[03:26:18.878 --> 03:26:24.583]  David Horowitz, you just mentioned, David Horowitz is utterly inoffensive on racial grounds.
[03:26:24.623 --> 03:26:29.847]  I don't know what pretext they use to take him down, but it's appalling.
[03:26:30.348 --> 03:26:37.474]  And partly because David Horowitz knows more about the communist conspiracy in America than anyone, which is probably the reason he had to be silenced.
[03:26:38.470 --> 03:26:51.294]  Well, what they did, of course, they rely on the Southern Poverty Law Center, which has almost become a hate group to finger everyone who doesn't agree with the leftist agenda and calling them a hate group.
[03:26:52.954 --> 03:27:02.257]  What about how they've all colluded really to destroy Trump through their endless propaganda, not to mention that
[03:27:03.506 --> 03:27:08.709]  Uh, if you just look at the public's response to that, they've kind of in the media, they've kind of cheered it on.
[03:27:09.310 --> 03:27:17.494]  We even saw Bill Mayer actually defended Alex Jones the other day on his show, and the audience, you know, didn't didn't appreciate that very much.
[03:27:17.835 --> 03:27:20.536]  What's happening with just the general population?
[03:27:20.556 --> 03:27:25.959]  I guess the Democrats that seem to support anti First Amendment behavior.
[03:27:27.040 --> 03:27:30.522]  You know, they obviously we know they wouldn't be supporting it if it were not
[03:27:31.913 --> 03:27:33.834]  And they're seemingly in their best interest.
[03:27:34.275 --> 03:27:45.244]  I thought the scariest part of the of the Bill Maher exposure, and credit to Bill Maher for bringing this up, you know, he said, you know, liberals are supposed to be in favor of freedom of speech.
[03:27:45.265 --> 03:27:49.228]  This isn't a First Amendment issue with Twitter, but it is a freedom of speech issue.
[03:27:49.889 --> 03:27:53.532]  Jennifer Granholm, former governor of Michigan,
[03:27:54.062 --> 03:28:01.525]  When Mar says that Alex Jones was banned, she goes, thank God, you know, this is a government official at the highest level.
[03:28:01.865 --> 03:28:05.326]  Thank God that we took someone's free speech away.
[03:28:05.766 --> 03:28:08.667]  You know, it's a scary trend, Joel.
[03:28:08.727 --> 03:28:12.709]  And I, you know, I thought we had, it had played itself out, but it hasn't.
[03:28:13.809 --> 03:28:17.951]  It will become more obvious and more dramatic, I think, in the weeks and months to come.
[03:28:19.366 --> 03:28:23.429]  Yeah, look, I think it's another attempt to influence the midterm election.
[03:28:23.469 --> 03:28:29.734]  They think if they prevent other voices from exposing some of these trends that they'll be better off.
[03:28:30.335 --> 03:28:36.640]  We'll see how the people respond and we'll see how much voter fraud they use to make it happen.
[03:28:37.380 --> 03:28:39.761]  We're going to come back next segment with Jack Cashill.
[03:28:40.461 --> 03:28:49.085]  He's wrote a series of articles about the Trayvon Martin film made by Jay-Z, conveniently coming out before the midterms on BET.
[03:28:49.145 --> 03:28:51.666]  There's a whole series and we're going to get into that.
[03:28:51.706 --> 03:28:53.647]  He wrote the book called If I Had a Son.
[03:28:54.107 --> 03:28:56.728]  We'll be right back with Jack Cashill after the break.
[03:29:02.378 --> 03:29:10.363]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from InfoWarsLife.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.
[03:29:10.623 --> 03:29:12.944]  And listen, everybody's got a heart.

[03:29:59.466 --> 03:30:01.648]  Now available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:08.611]  We're at Whole Paycheck.
[03:30:09.191 --> 03:30:12.313]  Or now, not at Whole Foods, but Amazon Foods.
[03:30:12.634 --> 03:30:15.235]  You know Jeff Bezos owns this now, right?
[03:30:15.255 --> 03:30:16.817]  The guy that owns Amazon, the richest guy in the world?
[03:30:17.137 --> 03:30:19.458]  It's on record that they've cut back the amount of organic food here.
[03:30:19.999 --> 03:30:21.520]  It's on record they're cutting back the quality.
[03:30:21.540 --> 03:30:22.580]  Their own employees have been blamed.
[03:30:22.701 --> 03:30:26.363]  Most of your big top billionaires have got the laws written where they don't pay any taxes.
[03:30:26.503 --> 03:30:27.544]  This is a great product right here.
[03:30:29.397 --> 03:30:31.038]  We're coming out with one similar.
[03:30:31.058 --> 03:30:31.998]  You need magnesium.
[03:30:32.138 --> 03:30:33.099]  You need all this for your body.
[03:30:33.519 --> 03:30:35.660]  They say it's a scam, and I sell it, but not Jeff Bezos.
[03:30:36.060 --> 03:30:41.823]  So, this is the most consumerist thing in the world by a monopoly man who's buying up the whole country.
[03:30:41.843 --> 03:30:42.683]  Made $12 billion in one day.
[03:30:45.044 --> 03:30:46.125]  12 billion himself.
[03:30:46.145 --> 03:30:48.546]  12 b-b-b-b-billion.
[03:30:48.906 --> 03:30:50.467]  This is Bezos' private property.
[03:30:50.908 --> 03:30:51.908]  He doesn't respect ours.
[03:30:51.928 --> 03:30:53.669]  He lobbies to end small family homes.
[03:30:54.130 --> 03:30:56.671]  He wants 250 square foot coffin apartments.
[03:30:56.691 --> 03:30:58.272]  USA Today called for that last week.
[03:30:58.472 --> 03:31:01.494]  He doesn't want you to have any money, but he made 12 billion dollars in one day last week.
[03:31:01.654 --> 03:31:03.215]  But I agree with his property rights.
[03:31:03.495 --> 03:31:05.396]  And I agree with this security officer's point.
[03:31:05.676 --> 03:31:06.517]  This is private property.
[03:31:06.897 --> 03:31:07.898]  And they've asked us to stop filming.
[03:31:07.938 --> 03:31:10.739]  So what we're going to do is, we're going to go wait outside on the property line.
[03:31:10.919 --> 03:31:11.500]  Last morning,
[03:31:12.200 --> 03:31:13.802]  You know, you're in private property.
[03:31:13.882 --> 03:31:16.124]  Whole Foods doesn't want you on the property.
[03:31:16.304 --> 03:31:17.745]  You can go around the parking lot.
[03:31:17.785 --> 03:31:20.927]  So, if you want to go to the sidewalk right now before you call AT&T.
[03:31:21.468 --> 03:31:22.048]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[03:31:22.068 --> 03:31:24.911]  Because you're not following our instructions, our public instructions.
[03:31:24.931 --> 03:31:27.193]  So, if you can go to the sidewalk, that's all.
[03:31:27.393 --> 03:31:28.393]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:31:28.574 --> 03:31:29.594]  I'm trying to be courteous.
[03:31:29.614 --> 03:31:30.175]  Can I get my car?
[03:31:30.215 --> 03:31:32.217]  I'm trying to be courteous and nice to you.
[03:31:32.237 --> 03:31:32.957]  You're not complying.
[03:31:32.977 --> 03:31:33.558]  I'm being really nice.
[03:31:33.758 --> 03:31:35.199]  I need you to go to the sidewalk.
[03:31:35.239 --> 03:31:36.840]  Well, sure I will, but I can't get my car.
[03:31:36.900 --> 03:31:38.402]  Maybe I can go to the sidewalk, please.
[03:31:40.092 --> 03:31:41.674]  Try it nice, like you did too, big man.
[03:31:41.934 --> 03:31:42.394]  Big tough guy.
[03:31:45.251 --> 03:31:53.873]  Jeff Bezos made $12 million in one day last week, ripping you off by owning Whole Foods and lowering the quality.
[03:31:53.953 --> 03:32:01.194]  Jeff Bezos makes $1.50 on every single package he ships out on Amazon to the US Postal Service.
[03:32:01.254 --> 03:32:05.755]  Jeff Bezos is a criminal who is anti-free-market and anti-America.
[03:32:05.935 --> 03:32:11.156]  And we came out here nicely to cover it, and he had one of his dudes get in our face.
[03:32:11.196 --> 03:32:14.377]  So, the little cheetah's in there, they think it's funny.
[03:32:15.797 --> 03:32:16.718]  Look at this!
[03:32:16.738 --> 03:32:18.079]  Look at this trending!
[03:32:18.839 --> 03:32:20.400]  Jeff Bezos is your enemy!
[03:32:20.580 --> 03:32:21.700]  Bezos thinks you're schmucks.
[03:32:22.401 --> 03:32:25.082]  He made $12 billion in one day, last week.
[03:32:25.622 --> 03:32:26.983]  Richest guy in the world.
[03:32:27.523 --> 03:32:29.544]  And that jerk, they know my car's parked in there.
[03:32:29.564 --> 03:32:30.585]  I said, yeah, we're going to stop filming.
[03:32:30.665 --> 03:32:31.385]  I'm going to get my car.
[03:32:31.405 --> 03:32:32.206]  He said, get off the property.
[03:32:33.308 --> 03:32:34.388]  See how that works in America?
[03:32:34.728 --> 03:32:37.909]  Like, 18 of my products are private-labeled national brands that they private-labeled, too.
[03:32:37.929 --> 03:32:44.991]  We had to come in here and just get in Bezos' face, because, I mean, the leftists in here even told me when I had three kids—I got four now—hey, you got too many kids.
[03:32:45.071 --> 03:32:45.792]  That's the cult.
[03:32:46.072 --> 03:32:52.213]  They got magazines that say sustainable development, you know, being poor is the new chic, austerity's cool.
[03:32:53.174 --> 03:32:54.254]  Bezos isn't austere.
[03:33:06.022 --> 03:33:10.723]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.444 --> 03:33:28.108]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:33:28.848 --> 03:33:30.348]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:30.789 --> 03:33:31.909]  Longing for the sun.
[03:33:32.995 --> 03:33:34.856]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.936 --> 03:33:39.279]  Joel Gilbert bringing this show to you from the People's Republic of California.
[03:33:39.920 --> 03:33:42.301]  We have with us writer Jack Cashill.
[03:33:42.341 --> 03:33:47.985]  He wrote the seminal book on the George Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin trial called If I Had a Son.
[03:33:48.325 --> 03:33:51.307]  He attended the trial almost gavel to gavel.
[03:33:52.248 --> 03:34:01.334]  And Paramount Network and BET are showing a series called Rest in Power about the death of Trayvon Martin with Jay-Z as the producer, the big Obama and frequent
[03:34:02.443 --> 03:34:04.946]  You know, big Obama pal and White House guest.
[03:34:04.986 --> 03:34:12.173]  Of course, his wife, Beyonce, was famous for actually lip syncing the national anthem at Obama's second inauguration.
[03:34:13.214 --> 03:34:18.259]  Let's take a quick look at part of the trailer of Rest in Power, which is still showing every Monday night.
[03:34:25.060 --> 03:34:29.342]  Okay, those are all the scenes that we all remember from the trial and from the case.
[03:34:51.115 --> 03:35:03.766]  Benjamin Crump, of course, the attorney for the Martin family, called it the Skittles case, and it spurred Black Lives Matter, and it divided the nation between those who looked at the evidence and those who just seemed to not even care.
[03:35:04.667 --> 03:35:12.974]  So, you know, Jack Cashel, why did Jay-Z put his name to this miniseries, and why is he doing it just before the midterm elections?
[03:35:13.945 --> 03:35:26.053]  Well, that raises the question of why did this incident become a national, international phenomenon in a battleground state just before the 2012 election?
[03:35:26.693 --> 03:35:29.975]  And the reason is the same, and that is you want to influence votes.
[03:35:30.396 --> 03:35:31.716]  You want to stir up the base.
[03:35:32.237 --> 03:35:43.224]  They're afraid, especially with Kanye West wandering off the reservation, they've got to be afraid that if the Democrats lose 20% of the black vote, the Democratic Party is over.
[03:35:43.797 --> 03:35:46.659]  I mean, they won't have enough votes to win anything anymore.
[03:35:47.280 --> 03:35:50.602]  And they have to keep reinforcing this theme.
[03:35:50.622 --> 03:35:59.128]  You know, it's interesting, Joel, because I had lunch with George Zimmerman not too long ago with his parents and a friend.
[03:35:59.248 --> 03:36:04.372]  And I said to him, I said, you know, George was named after his uncle Jorge.
[03:36:05.132 --> 03:36:06.513]  His mother is Afro-Peruvian.
[03:36:07.314 --> 03:36:11.457]  And I said, you know, if you had just named George Jorge,
[03:36:12.336 --> 03:36:15.299]  No one would have ever heard of this incident beyond Sanford, Florida.
[03:36:16.239 --> 03:36:18.561]  And George said, you're exactly right.
[03:36:19.022 --> 03:36:23.866]  And then the mom turned to Dan and said, see, I told you we should have called him Jorge, you know?
[03:36:23.886 --> 03:36:26.508]  Let me ask you a question.
[03:36:26.928 --> 03:36:36.016]  What if Trayvon Martin had killed George Zimmerman if he didn't fire the shot and he eventually went unconscious and died of hemorrhaging and head injuries?
[03:36:36.056 --> 03:36:40.039]  Would anyone care that Trayvon Martin was sentenced to life in jail?
[03:36:40.059 --> 03:36:41.160]  Would we ever even know who he is?
[03:36:41.909 --> 03:36:47.851]  No, we wouldn't know who he was, nor would we have known who he was if Zimmerman's name had been Jorge.
[03:36:47.871 --> 03:36:55.494]  Because the media would have wanted nothing to do with a case in 2012 in a battleground state that involved a Jorge and a Trayvon.
[03:36:55.854 --> 03:36:58.335]  That's not in their agenda.
[03:36:58.435 --> 03:37:02.777]  They want the world to believe that blacks and Hispanics get along famously.
[03:37:03.037 --> 03:37:03.437]  They don't.
[03:37:04.208 --> 03:37:06.490]  And this was a case where that didn't happen.
[03:37:07.050 --> 03:37:18.139]  So they turned him into what the New York Times uniquely called a white Hispanic, George Zimmerman, a name that sounds German, maybe even Jewish, but it certainly doesn't sound Hispanic.
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:21.042]  And they ran on that name.
[03:37:21.282 --> 03:37:23.504]  They didn't even know what he looked like when they started their campaign.
[03:37:24.945 --> 03:37:32.111]  Well, Jack, look, I remember Al Sharpton going down there and they put forth this theme that they just want an arrest.
[03:37:32.211 --> 03:37:33.512]  Of course, he would say arrest.
[03:37:34.215 --> 03:37:36.216]  Without the T. We want an arrest.
[03:37:36.236 --> 03:37:36.797]  We want an arrest.
[03:37:36.837 --> 03:37:38.858]  And they did the same theme later in Ferguson.
[03:37:39.638 --> 03:37:41.039]  They just wanted an arrest.
[03:37:42.160 --> 03:37:44.461]  As if an arrest was a constitutional right.
[03:37:45.662 --> 03:37:46.443]  Like free speech.
[03:37:47.003 --> 03:37:49.324]  What was the point of them trying to get an arrest?
[03:37:49.925 --> 03:37:53.587]  And did they even ever expect or care that they would get a conviction?
[03:37:53.827 --> 03:37:54.988]  Was it all about the agenda?
[03:37:55.874 --> 03:38:06.256]  Well, I mean, for the lawyers, it's all about the arrest, because with an arrest, you can file a lawsuit, in which case, which they did against the Homeowners Association, who netted them a couple million dollars.
[03:38:07.836 --> 03:38:09.357]  So that's why the arrest was important.
[03:38:09.877 --> 03:38:16.518]  Now, as to the conviction, it reminds me of what happened with the original race case in America was the Sacco and Vanzetti case.
[03:38:16.998 --> 03:38:24.020]  The Soviet Union got involved through the Comintern, and they proclaimed the innocence of these two Italian anarchists in the 1920s.
[03:38:25.583 --> 03:38:33.288]  And Katharine Porter, who is a Pulitzer Prize winning author, was one of the many liberals who were drawn to the case then.
[03:38:33.388 --> 03:38:37.491]  And she remembers standing outside the prison the night they were to be executed.
[03:38:38.072 --> 03:38:43.716]  And she said to the communist woman who was running the protest, Oh God, I hope we can save them.
[03:38:44.276 --> 03:38:45.717]  And the communist said to her, saved?
[03:38:46.578 --> 03:38:48.719]  What good did they do us alive?
[03:38:49.260 --> 03:38:49.800]  They wanted
[03:38:50.470 --> 03:38:51.810]  Zockel and Vanzetti did.
[03:38:52.190 --> 03:38:58.652]  They wanted to be able to portray America as this racist stew of xenophobia, not as a melting pot.
[03:38:59.172 --> 03:39:04.473]  And the same thing with if George Zimmerman had been convicted, the whole thing would have been forgotten about.
[03:39:04.513 --> 03:39:11.835]  But with him innocent, they could go back to the base and say, listen, there's no justice in America, no justice, no peace.
[03:39:12.535 --> 03:39:15.616]  And the Black Lives Matter was formed out of that incident.
[03:39:16.116 --> 03:39:19.797]  And then two years later, they thought they found another test case.
[03:39:20.492 --> 03:39:24.537]  With Darren Wilson, officer in Ferguson, and Michael Brown.
[03:39:25.338 --> 03:39:31.024]  And in fact, I may be the only person in America who knows both Michael Brown and George Zimmerman.
[03:39:31.405 --> 03:39:32.426]  I attract these people.
[03:39:32.706 --> 03:39:36.631]  I run into a lot of people who get in trouble, and I find myself writing about them.
[03:39:38.513 --> 03:39:40.315]  But it's appalling what happened.
[03:39:41.229 --> 03:39:50.892]  Yeah, look, when they turned it into, then they turned it into, they milked it to an anti-gun rallying call, claiming that this was a result of the Stand Your Ground laws.
[03:39:51.412 --> 03:39:59.495]  My understanding is, it never was a Stand Your Ground case, it was simply a self-defense case, and Zimmerman never even claimed Stand Your Ground.
[03:40:00.195 --> 03:40:02.596]  How far... Yeah, go ahead and comment.
[03:40:02.616 --> 03:40:03.536]  I was going to say, you're right.
[03:40:05.609 --> 03:40:11.374]  You know, among the many dishonesties of the Jay- Jay-Z series, is this constant talk of stand your ground.
[03:40:11.614 --> 03:40:13.496]  Stand your ground had nothing to do with the case.
[03:40:14.016 --> 03:40:28.389]  If someone jumps you, and is punching you in the head, MMA style, pounding ground, and you're, you know, against a concrete sidewalk, and your only recourse when he grabs- goes to grab your gun is to shoot him first, that's classic self-defense.
[03:40:28.749 --> 03:40:30.650]  There's no ground to be held there.
[03:40:31.011 --> 03:40:32.212]  You know, it's not like you had a choice.
[03:40:32.805 --> 03:40:34.667]  And leaving or not leaving that site.
[03:40:35.167 --> 03:40:36.108]  That was self-defense.
[03:40:36.388 --> 03:40:37.289]  The jury knew it.
[03:40:37.709 --> 03:40:38.590]  They acquitted him.
[03:40:39.431 --> 03:40:44.835]  And the media, which should... Okay, I get the Black Lives Matter movement.
[03:40:44.875 --> 03:40:45.676]  They got an agenda.
[03:40:46.076 --> 03:40:48.418]  It's a disgrace for the media to continue this lie.
[03:40:50.163 --> 03:40:53.866]  Well, why is this case so emotional six years later?
[03:40:54.747 --> 03:41:00.331]  Trayvon Martin, the hoodie, all the imagery, it still conjures up a tremendous amount of emotion.
[03:41:01.031 --> 03:41:07.056]  And I guess that's why the Jay-Z series was put together with the midterms in mind, is how I see it.
[03:41:07.907 --> 03:41:08.567]  No, you're right.
[03:41:08.588 --> 03:41:17.613]  Because for the average person who's not following the media particularly closely, white or black, they're still thinking of Trayvon Martin that they saw on the cover of People magazine.
[03:41:18.034 --> 03:41:20.235]  You know, the 11-year-old boy who wanted to be a pilot.
[03:41:20.855 --> 03:41:32.263]  They don't know that at age 15, when his father left to fill another woman, the woman who had raised Trayvon, his life descended into, you know, your classic, I hate to say it, black teenage
[03:41:32.922 --> 03:41:33.282]  I think so.
[03:41:54.335 --> 03:41:56.316]  I saw this black guy in a hoodie.
[03:41:56.656 --> 03:42:01.957]  He was on top of a white or Hispanic guy, and he was raining down blows on him, MMA style.
[03:42:02.417 --> 03:42:04.078]  The guy was helpless on blow.
[03:42:04.458 --> 03:42:06.138]  He's yelling out, help, help, help me.
[03:42:07.239 --> 03:42:11.900]  They knew that within 15 minutes, the police did.
[03:42:11.920 --> 03:42:13.200]  The man testified at the trial.
[03:42:13.220 --> 03:42:15.261]  As soon as he did, the trial was over in a real sense.
[03:42:16.581 --> 03:42:21.623]  The media and Jay-Z refused to even talk about that witness.
[03:42:22.908 --> 03:42:26.192]  And so they have to make everything else up to cover that gap.
[03:42:27.353 --> 03:42:30.936]  OK, well, Jack, you've done amazing work with your book, If I Had a Son.
[03:42:30.956 --> 03:42:31.597]  I have read it.
[03:42:31.657 --> 03:42:32.718]  It really tracks the case.
[03:42:32.778 --> 03:42:33.318]  It's riveting.
[03:42:34.419 --> 03:42:38.744]  And you're revisiting the story with Jay-Z's documentary.
[03:42:39.084 --> 03:42:40.926]  I do encourage everyone to keep looking at it.
[03:42:40.986 --> 03:42:42.627]  It's for the next two Monday nights on BET.
[03:42:44.073 --> 03:42:49.800]  And you'll see what Jack's talking about, how they're still portraying this case despite some of the facts.
[03:42:49.881 --> 03:42:55.227]  Thanks to Jack Cashill, we're coming up with Kevin Jackson, Fox News commentator with a new movie out.
[03:42:55.307 --> 03:42:57.871]  We'll talk to Kevin, and we'll see you after the break.
[03:43:10.109 --> 03:43:11.509]  My friends, we have done it.
[03:43:12.150 --> 03:43:18.251]  With Dr. Group's help, we have developed the ultimate male vitality supplement with eight concentrated super herbs.
[03:43:18.872 --> 03:43:24.393]  This is the answer to the globalist war on male vitality with the estrogen mimickers they've added to the food and the water supply.
[03:43:24.693 --> 03:43:30.915]  And now our test pilot, our Chuck Yeager, Dr. Edward Group, is here to test his greatest invention.
[03:43:31.135 --> 03:43:31.455]  Doctor?
[03:43:31.475 --> 03:43:33.056]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:43:33.436 --> 03:43:37.957]  I will now take two droppers to test this ultimate male vitality formula.
[03:43:40.851 --> 03:43:44.034]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a momentous moment.
[03:43:45.315 --> 03:43:45.855]  Thank you, Dr. Group.
[03:43:46.816 --> 03:43:49.218]  I will activate my muscles by doing push-ups.
[03:43:49.699 --> 03:43:50.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is it.
[03:43:51.660 --> 03:43:52.401]  This is the move.
[03:43:52.441 --> 03:43:54.002]  This is unprecedented.
[03:43:54.022 --> 03:43:56.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to see what happens right now.
[03:43:56.705 --> 03:43:57.565]  Oh my God!
[03:43:57.766 --> 03:43:58.406]  What the hell?
[03:43:58.626 --> 03:43:59.327]  Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[03:43:59.347 --> 03:44:00.288]  Get out of here!
[03:44:00.308 --> 03:44:00.828]  Shut this down!
[03:44:00.848 --> 03:44:01.649]  This is not safe!
[03:44:01.889 --> 03:44:02.670]  This is not... Hold on!
[03:44:02.910 --> 03:44:03.330]  Settle down!
[03:44:03.771 --> 03:44:03.891]  Get...
[03:44:04.151 --> 03:44:04.892]  Get another doctor.
[03:44:04.952 --> 03:44:05.492]  Something's wrong.
[03:44:05.772 --> 03:44:06.433]  Something's wrong with him.
[03:44:06.453 --> 03:44:06.973]  Help him.
[03:44:06.993 --> 03:44:09.014]  Ladies and gentlemen, we did not intend for that to happen.
[03:44:09.094 --> 03:44:09.975]  I take it personally.
[03:44:10.195 --> 03:44:11.356]  Do not have those problems.
[03:44:11.996 --> 03:44:14.538]  Again, these are authorized herbs.
[03:44:14.898 --> 03:44:15.779]  Well known to be safe.
[03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:18.160]  Please, doctor.
[03:44:18.560 --> 03:44:19.421]  Doctor, wait a minute.
[03:44:19.621 --> 03:44:22.283]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're just going to cut the commercial for just a moment.
[03:44:22.503 --> 03:44:23.003]  Cut, cut, cut.
[03:44:23.063 --> 03:44:24.084]  Get everybody out of here.
[03:44:28.530 --> 03:44:29.831]  Super Male Vitality.
[03:44:30.311 --> 03:44:30.932]  It's awesome.
[03:44:31.392 --> 03:44:33.213]  Just not this awesome.
[03:44:33.574 --> 03:44:34.274]  Oh my God!
[03:44:34.494 --> 03:44:35.195]  What the hell?
[03:44:35.615 --> 03:44:38.337]  Ladies and gentlemen, the dramatization you've just seen is just that.
[03:44:38.917 --> 03:44:44.902]  It is satire to illustrate in a satirical way the incredible power of Super Male Vitality.
[03:44:46.041 --> 03:44:54.088]  It will not turn you into Conan the Barbarian, but it will help block some of the estrogen mimicers and reportedly let your glands produce the natural hormones your body needs.
[03:44:54.569 --> 03:44:58.572]  It also does have some other side effects in the human testing that we discovered, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:44:58.592 --> 03:45:01.976]  I'm about to illustrate right now what that is.
[03:45:01.996 --> 03:45:03.497]  Let's see if I can do it again.
[03:45:03.537 --> 03:45:04.458]  It takes some focus.
[03:45:05.198 --> 03:45:06.440]  Up, up, and away!
[03:45:14.148 --> 03:45:18.596]  Start your journey to super male vitality today at InfoWarsLife.com
[03:45:35.407 --> 03:45:38.289]  Let's go ahead and talk to Make America Great Again, Titan.
[03:45:38.309 --> 03:45:39.590]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[03:45:39.730 --> 03:45:43.253]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[03:45:43.533 --> 03:45:46.015]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[03:45:46.056 --> 03:45:48.618]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[03:45:48.678 --> 03:45:51.760]  Survival Shield, Mason, Iodine X2, life-changing.
[03:45:51.800 --> 03:45:53.662]  Supermail Vitality, life-changing.
[03:45:53.702 --> 03:45:55.363]  Brain Force Plus, life-changing.
[03:45:55.423 --> 03:45:57.725]  Super Blue Non-Fluid Toothpaste, life-changing.
[03:45:57.745 --> 03:45:59.226]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[03:45:59.246 --> 03:46:01.208]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[03:46:01.268 --> 03:46:02.909]  The hats, the t-shirts, amazing.
[03:46:03.129 --> 03:46:04.931]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[03:46:04.971 --> 03:46:06.173]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[03:46:06.213 --> 03:46:07.975]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[03:46:08.055 --> 03:46:09.717]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[03:46:09.757 --> 03:46:11.539]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[03:46:11.619 --> 03:46:13.001]  A Spanish health supporter, like I said.
[03:46:13.101 --> 03:46:15.243]  And I started working out every day.
[03:46:15.383 --> 03:46:16.745]  I lift weights every day.
[03:46:16.905 --> 03:46:18.467]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[03:46:18.647 --> 03:46:20.127]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X2.
[03:46:20.227 --> 03:46:21.508]  I drop that every morning.
[03:46:21.548 --> 03:46:22.568]  I feel fantastic.
[03:46:22.588 --> 03:46:23.548]  My skin is clearing up.
[03:46:23.568 --> 03:46:24.209]  I have psoriasis.
[03:46:24.249 --> 03:46:25.249]  So that's clearing up.
[03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:26.529]  My hair is going back thicker.
[03:46:26.549 --> 03:46:29.810]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[03:46:29.850 --> 03:46:31.791]  The brain force is just amazing.
[03:46:31.871 --> 03:46:33.111]  That stuff makes you think.
[03:46:33.271 --> 03:46:34.371]  It keeps you on your toes.
[03:46:34.391 --> 03:46:35.612]  The same thing with the iodine.
[03:46:35.632 --> 03:46:37.972]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[03:46:38.012 --> 03:46:39.373]  And your products are amazing.
[03:46:39.473 --> 03:46:41.733]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[03:46:42.133 --> 03:46:43.874]  And it's just life changing.
[03:46:43.954 --> 03:46:46.295]  And how people can go against the true resistance.
[03:46:46.355 --> 03:46:47.995]  They're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong
[03:46:48.175 --> 03:46:49.676]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:29.346 --> 03:47:35.647]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:40.249 --> 03:47:41.789]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:41.829 --> 03:47:47.370]  Joel Gilbert finishing up this hour guest hosting from the People's Republic of California here in Los Angeles.
[03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:54.132]  Don't forget to check out my new film, Trump the Art of the Insult in the Alex Jones Infowars store.
[03:47:54.232 --> 03:47:55.352]  Go to Infowars.com.
[03:47:56.564 --> 03:47:58.226]  I am going to be taking some calls shortly.
[03:47:58.406 --> 03:48:01.649]  It's 1-877-789-2539.
[03:48:02.109 --> 03:48:03.991]  That's 1-877-789-ALEX.
[03:48:04.011 --> 03:48:09.795]  We're going to talk about everything we've covered so far on this show.
[03:48:09.815 --> 03:48:13.899]  Before I do that, I want to comment on the film The Incredibles.
[03:48:14.319 --> 03:48:19.203]  And you should have seen, hopefully, Incredibles number one.
[03:48:19.243 --> 03:48:20.844]  The first version was like 10 years ago.
[03:48:20.864 --> 03:48:24.868]  The Incredibles 2 came out only about six weeks ago.
[03:48:25.999 --> 03:48:29.301]  And it has a leftist theme.
[03:48:29.621 --> 03:48:37.085]  It's a complete transformation of Hollywood from superheroes and fun into leftist messaging.
[03:48:37.465 --> 03:48:38.966]  And I'm going to tell you what it is in a second.
[03:48:38.986 --> 03:48:45.630]  Let's roll a small clip of the trailer to remind you about the Incredibles and how they've gone incredibly far to the left.
[03:48:46.930 --> 03:48:51.473]  Behold, the Underminer!
[03:48:51.513 --> 03:48:52.753]  Watch out for Jack-Jack.
[03:48:52.774 --> 03:48:54.614]  I thought we were going to go with... You heard your mother, trampoline me!
[03:48:58.323 --> 03:49:01.104]  Superheroes are illegal.
[03:49:01.124 --> 03:49:01.784]  That's good enough.
[03:49:01.844 --> 03:49:04.685]  This is the Incredibles 2 trailer.
[03:49:05.466 --> 03:49:14.069]  And what's different about the Incredibles this time is the wife is now the main character, Elastigirl.
[03:49:14.189 --> 03:49:21.212]  She's the character that goes out and fights the evil villains while Mr. Incredible stays at home and takes care of the kids for the entire movie.
[03:49:22.092 --> 03:49:24.553]  And then the villain is also a female.
[03:49:25.481 --> 03:49:39.349]  When the female superhero eventually captures the evil female villain, as she's going into the police station, the daughter of Elastigirl says, well, she's not going to stay in prison very long because she's rich.
[03:49:40.270 --> 03:49:55.139]  So you see how the superhero genre, along with the rest of Hollywood, has just turned into this leftist messaging concept, where they're trying to push social messages and far-left messages nonstop.
[03:49:55.846 --> 03:50:01.769]  And this is why I think people are being turned off, and maybe that's why I think The Incredibles number two didn't do very well.
[03:50:02.509 --> 03:50:04.390]  But let's go ahead and take a couple of phone calls.
[03:50:04.930 --> 03:50:12.073]  We're going to go to, let's see here, I don't have any names up yet, but let's go ahead and, well, I'm going to have to wait until we get a name.
[03:50:12.133 --> 03:50:14.134]  Everyone's name is question mark right now.
[03:50:15.874 --> 03:50:24.618]  But before we do that, let's go with a little more about the series Rest in Power, the Trayvon Martin case.
[03:50:25.342 --> 03:50:27.283]  Uh, that Jack Cashill just talked about.
[03:50:28.323 --> 03:50:33.204]  I think the best way to look at that in retrospect is that that incident never should have happened.
[03:50:33.264 --> 03:50:43.107]  It was more like a road rage incident where two people that didn't know each other, uh, came into a situation where someone got extremely agitated and attacked the other person.
[03:50:43.847 --> 03:50:49.189]  Just like in a road rage incident, normally people come out of their cars and say, Hey, stop fighting, stop fighting.
[03:50:49.809 --> 03:50:53.290]  In this case, people came out of their apartments and said, you know, cut this out.
[03:50:54.236 --> 03:50:55.757]  And Zimmerman yelled for help.
[03:50:55.797 --> 03:50:56.357]  Please help me.
[03:50:56.377 --> 03:50:56.878]  Please help me.
[03:50:56.918 --> 03:50:57.598]  No one helped him.
[03:50:58.319 --> 03:51:02.521]  So he eventually shot Martin and very tragically died.
[03:51:03.042 --> 03:51:09.606]  So we hear about these road rage types of incidents where people get on each other's nerve in some way.
[03:51:09.686 --> 03:51:12.207]  Someone attacks and then nobody helps them.
[03:51:12.288 --> 03:51:16.530]  So just a real tragedy that was then exploited by the people with the agenda.
[03:51:17.051 --> 03:51:19.232]  I think the local police did their job.
[03:51:19.272 --> 03:51:20.673]  They investigated for two weeks.
[03:51:21.457 --> 03:51:28.640]  They said, look, all the physical evidence, the witnesses, the 911 calls support a self-defense story.
[03:51:28.801 --> 03:51:29.741]  There's no case here.
[03:51:30.441 --> 03:51:39.646]  And then the people with the agendas came in from Washington, from the Department of Justice, and they used both Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin for political ends.
[03:51:40.286 --> 03:51:42.767]  And that's pretty much a synopsis of, I think, the case.
[03:51:43.227 --> 03:51:49.730]  And I do encourage everyone to tune in to BET next Monday night and the following Monday so you can hear
[03:51:51.647 --> 03:51:52.888]  How they're portraying the story.
[03:51:53.428 --> 03:51:55.549]  Let's go to James in North Carolina.
[03:51:55.569 --> 03:51:55.969]  Go ahead.
[03:51:55.989 --> 03:51:58.451]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, James.
[03:52:00.212 --> 03:52:05.574]  Today, I just want to talk about kind of black support for Trump is just booming.
[03:52:05.975 --> 03:52:15.780]  I think it terrifies the elites and the Democrats, and now they're pushing anything they can to try to create race division and try to split us up leading up to the midterms.
[03:52:16.140 --> 03:52:20.002]  I mean, look at what happens to Candace Owens, Paris Denard.
[03:52:20.836 --> 03:52:26.220]  Kanye West, any black supporter that comes out and thinks or thinks for themselves as a conservative.
[03:52:26.841 --> 03:52:27.722]  They're trash.
[03:52:27.902 --> 03:52:28.682]  They're shunned.
[03:52:28.762 --> 03:52:29.523]  They're crazy.
[03:52:29.683 --> 03:52:30.844]  They're not really black.
[03:52:30.884 --> 03:52:31.865]  They're an Uncle Tom.
[03:52:32.405 --> 03:52:34.827]  And this is the racism of the Democrat Party.
[03:52:34.927 --> 03:52:35.688]  It never ended.
[03:52:35.728 --> 03:52:36.989]  Yeah, it's a good point.
[03:52:37.069 --> 03:52:37.690]  It's a good point.
[03:52:37.710 --> 03:52:37.950]  Thanks.
[03:52:38.170 --> 03:52:38.630]  Thanks for the call.
[03:52:38.650 --> 03:52:39.111]  It's a good point.
[03:52:39.131 --> 03:52:40.452]  Look, you probably saw my film.
[03:52:40.552 --> 03:52:41.633]  Also, Alex Jones story.
[03:52:41.673 --> 03:52:43.254]  There's no place like Utopia.
[03:52:43.975 --> 03:52:46.617]  And I went around South Side Chicago, Detroit.
[03:52:47.481 --> 03:52:50.864]  Talked to a lot of black people and a lot of them were on welfare.
[03:52:50.884 --> 03:52:52.025]  They didn't want to be on welfare.
[03:52:52.165 --> 03:52:53.046]  They weren't happy about it.
[03:52:53.066 --> 03:52:53.727]  They wanted jobs.
[03:52:53.747 --> 03:52:54.507]  There were no jobs.
[03:52:55.168 --> 03:53:05.917]  You had a lot of people going to prison that weren't evil people but they made terrible choices to sell drugs and get into nonsense because there were no opportunities that were
[03:53:07.057 --> 03:53:07.917]  We're good to go.
[03:53:28.166 --> 03:53:29.386]  Marijuana being legalized.
[03:53:30.607 --> 03:53:34.448]  Black people in the inner cities that I met were actually big-time conservatives.
[03:53:35.248 --> 03:53:37.149]  They were still, though, kind of being manipulated.
[03:53:37.189 --> 03:53:39.290]  Well, we like Obama because he's black.
[03:53:40.050 --> 03:53:44.192]  And this is what the leftists had done over the years from the early 30s.
[03:53:45.192 --> 03:53:56.876]  In my movie, Dreams from My Real Father, which most people have seen, I chronicled that Obama's real biological dad was the black Bolshevik, Frank Marshall Davis, out of Chicago, a journalist
[03:53:57.606 --> 03:54:04.970]  That the white communists recruited to try to trick black people into coming on to the socialist communist cause.
[03:54:05.810 --> 03:54:07.951]  And black people at that time were no fools.
[03:54:07.991 --> 03:54:09.072]  They were religious people.
[03:54:09.432 --> 03:54:11.153]  They were Christians with strong families.
[03:54:11.633 --> 03:54:14.194]  They didn't believe in Marxism because it was atheist.
[03:54:14.234 --> 03:54:16.815]  They didn't believe in class warfare.
[03:54:16.875 --> 03:54:18.176]  They believed in love thy neighbor.
[03:54:18.976 --> 03:54:23.138]  And in the film, I chronicled how Barack Obama was raised by Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:54:23.559 --> 03:54:26.160]  In addition to being his real father, he admits he was raised by him.
[03:54:26.894 --> 03:54:28.415]  And Obama followed in his footsteps.
[03:54:28.455 --> 03:54:38.422]  He went back to Chicago and was supported by white communists, developing communities project, community organizer, to try to trick black people to become socialists.
[03:54:39.162 --> 03:54:40.443]  It really didn't work in the 80s.
[03:54:40.463 --> 03:54:41.304]  They were no fools.
[03:54:41.344 --> 03:54:42.485]  They rejected Obama.
[03:54:42.985 --> 03:54:46.848]  When he ran for Congress in the early 2000s, Obama was rejected.
[03:54:46.868 --> 03:54:47.788]  They knew he was a phony.
[03:54:48.689 --> 03:54:52.512]  It was only later when he got the big support of Bill Ayers and some of these
[03:54:53.715 --> 03:54:57.116]  Radicals from the 60s that they promoted a new story.
[03:54:57.196 --> 03:55:19.465]  My father's a goat herder from Kenya So I'm going to bring everyone together and people started to buy into it But it's a long sad history of how the Democrats are actually using black leaders To try to get black people to support them, and I think it's falling apart finally they realize that The entire Democrat agenda is not in their interest Let's now go to
[03:55:20.663 --> 03:55:21.644]  Scott in Connecticut.
[03:55:21.684 --> 03:55:22.245]  Go ahead, Scott.
[03:55:22.265 --> 03:55:23.686]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:55:24.887 --> 03:55:25.128]  Yes.
[03:55:25.168 --> 03:55:26.489]  Hi, Joel.
[03:55:26.649 --> 03:55:32.055]  I just wanted to say I did see your film, and I thought it was such a... It woke me up.
[03:55:32.255 --> 03:55:33.836]  I told all my friends.
[03:55:33.956 --> 03:55:36.079]  I told my family, who just didn't want to hear it.
[03:55:36.099 --> 03:55:39.282]  It's almost like they were actually arguing with me.
[03:55:39.302 --> 03:55:40.243]  They didn't want to know.
[03:55:40.263 --> 03:55:42.485]  They were afraid to know the truth.
[03:55:43.408 --> 03:55:50.590]  And finally, they are knowing the truth, and I finally asked everybody here, and thank you for writing that, doing your research for that.
[03:55:50.730 --> 03:55:55.492]  And as far as the Rick Trayvon Martin case, now I'm looking at it from a new perspective.
[03:55:56.052 --> 03:56:02.994]  I was a Democrat four years ago, and then I slowly changed to, you know, no, you know what I mean?
[03:56:03.095 --> 03:56:07.056]  So that everything now looks totally new, everything you're saying.
[03:56:07.116 --> 03:56:09.597]  I learned some new things today about, you know,
[03:56:11.415 --> 03:56:13.697]  Well, thanks for the call.
[03:56:13.717 --> 03:56:20.821]  Look, the mainstream media narrative is very shallow, it's very simplistic, and they want people to kind of buy into it and not think beyond that.
[03:56:20.921 --> 03:56:24.864]  Anytime you dig a little bit deeper, you can see there's much more to all this stuff.
[03:56:26.761 --> 03:56:42.160]  You know, the biggest fake news, the biggest fraudsters, the biggest conspiracy theorists are all the news organizations in 2008 that simply repeated Barack Obama's story that his father was a goat herder from Kenya and he's going to bring us all together with a big transparent government.
[03:56:42.661 --> 03:56:44.123]  It was all one big fraud.
[03:56:45.460 --> 03:56:59.150]  The truth that we're telling on this show, I think, educates people and it's very easy to see what went wrong with the Obama years that were so devastating and destructive, particularly to the black community.
[03:56:59.411 --> 03:57:04.334]  Black people I talked to in my, there's no place like Utopia, they said they're just getting poorer.
[03:57:04.855 --> 03:57:06.236]  Taxes are going up, they're
[03:57:07.105 --> 03:57:08.446]  Companies are leaving town.
[03:57:08.926 --> 03:57:12.429]  Their kids are, you know, single parent culture, drug culture.
[03:57:13.169 --> 03:57:15.971]  And I think that they get it now.
[03:57:16.031 --> 03:57:29.180]  They really appreciate that Donald Trump has brought jobs and an economy where people can grow in the free market system and become what they want to be and not be dependent on these welfare programs.
[03:57:29.660 --> 03:57:34.083]  And that's why the Democrats are so eager to have open borders to bring in illegals
[03:57:35.003 --> 03:57:39.905]  To replace the black voters and the black people that are not buying into this anymore.
[03:57:40.205 --> 03:57:46.027]  That's part of the equation and it's definitely against the interests of all Americans, especially black community.
[03:57:46.348 --> 03:57:48.809]  Thank you for being here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:48.829 --> 03:57:49.789]  We'll see you next time.
[03:57:56.229 --> 03:58:03.731]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:58:04.231 --> 03:58:17.315]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:58:18.775 --> 03:58:22.138]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space-time.
[03:58:22.578 --> 03:58:26.702]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:58:26.922 --> 03:58:29.044]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[03:58:31.701 --> 03:58:38.262]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[03:58:38.502 --> 03:58:44.644]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[03:58:45.004 --> 03:58:46.604]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[03:58:47.024 --> 03:58:47.824]  It's fulfilling.
[03:58:48.025 --> 03:58:48.725]  InfoWars.
[03:58:49.105 --> 03:58:49.985]  Tomorrow's News.
[03:58:50.285 --> 03:58:50.765]  Today.
[03:58:54.786 --> 03:58:56.206]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[03:58:56.266 --> 03:58:58.127]  Victor, uh, you're calling, go ahead.
[03:58:58.227 --> 03:58:59.567]  Yes, uh, hi Alex.
