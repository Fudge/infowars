[00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:06.629]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.296]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[00:00:11.717 --> 00:00:14.341]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.

[00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:42.304]  There's a guy on the radio.

[00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:44.345]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:48.389]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.290]  Time to stop submitting to this charity!
[00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.532]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:54.174]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:55.975]  InfoWars went even further.
[00:00:56.115 --> 00:00:59.258]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:03.141]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.063]  Nobody can dispute the fact
[00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:06.523]  At your own risk!
[00:01:06.703 --> 00:01:11.025]  InfoWars.com InfoWars.com InfoWars comes to mind.

[00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:32.134]  And that's what you should want!
[00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.289]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:46.181]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:56.619]  America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America.
[00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.522]  We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.
[00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:06.184]  We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.
[00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:17.850]  We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable, and we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.
[00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.432]  We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world.
[00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.893]  Energy is abundant and affordable.
[00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:30.954]  There has never been a better time to do business in America.
[00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:39.357]  We are also making historic investments in the American military, because we cannot have prosperity without security.
[00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:54.413]  To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations.
[00:02:55.706 --> 00:03:00.568]  Our common security requires everyone to contribute their fair share.
[00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:16.214]  My administration is proud to have led historic efforts at the United Nations Security Council and all around the world to unite all civilized nations in our campaign of maximum pressure to de-nuke
[00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:18.796]  The Korean Peninsula.
[00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:28.004]  We continue to call on partners to confront Iran's support for terrorists and block Iran's path to a nuclear weapon.
[00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:36.412]  We're also working with allies and partners to destroy jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS, and very successfully so.
[00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:50.396]  The United States is leading a very broad coalition to deny terrorists control of their territory and populations, to cut off their funding, and to discredit their wicked ideology.
[00:03:51.477 --> 00:04:04.160]  I am pleased to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has retaken almost 100% of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:12.943]  There is still more fighting and work to be done and to consolidate our gains.
[00:04:13.584 --> 00:04:25.329]  We are committed to ensuring that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists who want to commit mass murder to our civilian populations.
[00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.191]  I want to thank those nations represented here today that have joined in these crucial efforts.
[00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:40.915]  You are not just securing your own citizens, but saving lives and restoring hope for millions and millions of people.
[00:04:42.256 --> 00:04:48.483]  When it comes to terrorism, we will do whatever is necessary to protect our nation.
[00:04:49.064 --> 00:04:51.467]  We will defend our citizens and our borders.
[00:04:52.248 --> 00:04:59.177]  We are also securing our immigration system as a matter of both national and economic security.
[00:05:00.447 --> 00:05:04.511]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:06:10.165 --> 00:06:12.246]  When I grow up, I want to live in a free republic.
[00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:26.936]  Out on the road for 40 days.
[00:06:28.677 --> 00:06:34.761]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:35.182 --> 00:06:37.203]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:48.041]  To say a lot of wild things are happening is another understatement.
[00:06:49.502 --> 00:06:53.724]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Worldwide Friday Global Transmission.
[00:06:54.284 --> 00:06:57.606]  The 26th day already of January 2018.
[00:06:58.186 --> 00:07:00.887]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:07:01.627 --> 00:07:02.628]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:06.279]  Over-deliberate again.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.501]  Met with all the big global CEOs yesterday, first day in Davos.
[00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:13.262]  Met with them publicly, met with them privately.
[00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:15.422]  Many of them have now been interviewed.
[00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:27.486]  He just came in and said, how do I get you to move your businesses, your industries, your brain trust, your nanotech, your genetic engineering, your heavy manufacturing, your light manufacturing, your telecommunications?
[00:07:28.066 --> 00:07:29.307]  How do I get that moved?
[00:07:29.647 --> 00:07:30.267]  Your defense?
[00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:32.988]  How do I get that moved in the United States?
[00:07:35.148 --> 00:07:38.989]  Because the artificial restraints meant to de-industrialize the U.S.
[00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:43.650]  that has been the global order for 50 years is over!
[00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:55.692]  The United States, 50 years ago, was 57% of global production of all value-added goods, other than agrarian, other than farming.
[00:07:57.512 --> 00:07:58.192]  By the 60s, it was 50%.
[00:07:58.232 --> 00:07:58.572]  By the 80s, it was 40%.
[00:08:02.472 --> 00:08:05.274]  Now there we are at like 25, 30 percent, depending on the year.
[00:08:06.195 --> 00:08:07.736]  And that's been done artificially.
[00:08:08.657 --> 00:08:10.759]  We were sold off, sold out.
[00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:12.981]  That's what globalism is, they admitted.
[00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:16.184]  And they thought, these arrogant people, that they would get away with it.
[00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:20.447]  Yes, they created a bunch of oligopolies and monopolies and combines.
[00:08:20.948 --> 00:08:22.269]  Yes, they created these systems.
[00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.251]  Yes, they stole trillions.
[00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.633]  But now they wanted full control
[00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:33.995]  And to make everybody really poor, to dictate humanity's surrender to the technocracy.
[00:08:34.916 --> 00:08:36.437]  That's DeVos' word.
[00:08:37.417 --> 00:08:41.960]  They say an authoritarian world government run by technocrats.
[00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:46.223]  And what does Juncker call himself?
[00:08:46.844 --> 00:08:50.486]  Heir to the Nazi fortune that runs the EU, unelected, a technocrat.
[00:08:50.866 --> 00:08:53.848]  What does Lloyd Blankfein, the head of Goldman Sachs, call himself?
[00:08:53.988 --> 00:08:54.489]  A technocrat.
[00:08:55.530 --> 00:09:14.624]  What does all of these people, like Michael Bloomberg, type in Michael Bloomberg, king of the technocrats, and you'll get articles from Bloomberg saying he knows how to run your life, he's a super genius, he has supercomputers, and he's gonna tell you how much salt you can have.
[00:09:15.404 --> 00:09:18.667]  And Bloomberg says, you're too dumb, I'm gonna run your life.
[00:09:19.568 --> 00:09:21.829]  There it is, the great technocrat.
[00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.070]  Yeah, that's Politico.
[00:09:23.811 --> 00:09:29.774]  But he's been called the king, the king of the technocrats by his own publication.
[00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:38.280]  These are men given NSA monopolies over data terminals because he agreed to hook them into the government starting back 40 years ago.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.722]  He was given the inside track, given the contract just like Microsoft.
[00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:45.444]  Total deep state front group on record.
[00:09:46.065 --> 00:09:49.526]  And then, years later, he's worth, what, 60, 70 billion dollars?
[00:09:49.846 --> 00:09:56.090]  And he says, I will run your life.
[00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:57.510]  Go read those articles.
[00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:07.816]  In the New York Times, the Washington Post, Politico, and Bloomberg about how, well, it sounds kind of authoritarian that he's going to run your life, but you know what?
[00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:10.717]  He's like Superman with jet copters.
[00:10:11.257 --> 00:10:12.078]  And he's so smart,
[00:10:13.715 --> 00:10:14.516]  He's our king!
[00:10:14.536 --> 00:10:17.418]  Oh, you're my king, Bloomberg!
[00:10:17.599 --> 00:10:18.720]  Oh, you're my king!
[00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:21.963]  And you run the Tavistock operation.
[00:10:24.445 --> 00:10:27.207]  You know, what did I tell people this whole trans movement was about?
[00:10:27.287 --> 00:10:31.912]  It has nothing to do with men that like to dress up like women and men that like other men.
[00:10:31.952 --> 00:10:32.953]  That's always gone on.
[00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:35.241]  I'm a Christian, but I'm a libertarian.
[00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:36.702]  I don't sit there and cast stones.
[00:10:37.343 --> 00:10:38.684]  He without sin casts the first stone.
[00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.547]  I'm not judging or hating anybody.
[00:10:40.747 --> 00:10:43.750]  The media always lies and says that, because they're the ones creating hate.
[00:10:44.952 --> 00:10:54.302]  But the entire modern trans movement was created by Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, the head of UNESCO at the UN.
[00:10:56.052 --> 00:11:05.218]  Who was the head of the World Eugenics League, and then that got embarrassing after Hitler, so he became the head of the World Transhumanist League.
[00:11:05.578 --> 00:11:11.982]  And he said, we're going to do it in the 60s, first by sex, saying you can flip your sex, and making it a civil right.
[00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:18.086]  Then we're going to move in, and we're going to have so many chemicals in the food and water, people aren't going to be able to have kids.
[00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:21.648]  We'll have to have artificial children that aren't even really humans, they're humanoid.
[00:11:22.858 --> 00:11:23.858]  They're saying, oh, it's liberal!
[00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:27.979]  If you're gay, have two dads, or, you know, for the baby, and have a surrogate.
[00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:29.140]  Or an artificial womb.
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.040]  Or if you're a lesbian, have two women.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.320]  Like, it's the woman thing.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.160]  It's not even a human.
[00:11:33.461 --> 00:11:35.561]  Two women making a humanoid's not a human.
[00:11:35.981 --> 00:11:36.741]  Two men doing it.
[00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:38.462]  The genetics don't even splice.
[00:11:38.922 --> 00:11:39.622]  They admit that.
[00:11:39.662 --> 00:11:40.682]  They've grown them in test tubes.
[00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:42.983]  They're not homo sapien sapien.
[00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:47.704]  It doesn't even manifest the mitochondria DNA chain.
[00:11:48.104 --> 00:11:49.204]  Or the extra chromosome.
[00:11:50.765 --> 00:11:51.605]  A woman and a man
[00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:55.518]  Create a homo sapien sapien.
[00:11:56.718 --> 00:11:58.419]  But again, then it's all about rights, see?
[00:11:58.759 --> 00:12:02.940]  So once you can identify as a blind person, we'll dump Drano in your eyes and taxpayers will pay for it.
[00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.601]  Identify as a woman, we'll pay to have your genitals cut off.
[00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:06.701]  You want to cut them off, man?
[00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:07.521]  I ain't paying for it.
[00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:08.641]  You want a nose job?
[00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:09.322]  I'm not paying for it.
[00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:10.422]  That's all logical.
[00:12:11.722 --> 00:12:17.144]  And now, before I get into all this other incredible news, I've got it right here in the stat today.
[00:12:17.164 --> 00:12:20.045]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:12:22.856 --> 00:12:39.932]  Unbelievable, where people now being arrested for reportedly raping children, we knew this was coming, are saying that they identify as a child so they can have sex with your children.
[00:12:40.312 --> 00:12:44.136]  And they've got all the people to say, oh I'm a 50 year old man but I identify as a 7 year old girl.
[00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:53.752]  I'm a Google executive, I identify as a golden dragonet, a dragon, and an ornate, beautiful building.
[00:12:53.772 --> 00:12:55.293]  And you go, that's total mental illness.
[00:12:55.373 --> 00:12:55.833]  No, it's not.
[00:12:57.233 --> 00:13:05.156]  When Google execs make their employees sit there in an ample feeder and say, I am a golden dragonet, you are a golden dragonet, they actually chant this.
[00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:07.157]  This is in the lawsuits, the documents have come out.
[00:13:08.035 --> 00:13:08.955]  I am an ornate building.
[00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:10.356]  You are an ornate building.
[00:13:10.396 --> 00:13:12.616]  This is cult mind control.
[00:13:12.896 --> 00:13:14.657]  It'd be like if I stood up and said, I am the Christ.
[00:13:14.997 --> 00:13:15.917]  You are the Christ.
[00:13:16.537 --> 00:13:17.737]  I am a holy pumpkin.
[00:13:18.057 --> 00:13:19.238]  You are a holy pumpkin.
[00:13:19.578 --> 00:13:26.799]  This is hardcore mass psychology re-education camp brainwashing.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.921]  Man accused of sexually assaulting three young girls says he's trans age.
[00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:51.054]  A 38-year-old man in Chicago, just look at that guy, he's the poster boy for this type of thing in my mind, is attempting to escape punishment for sexual assaulting three young girls by claiming he's a nine-year-old trapped in an adult's body.
[00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:57.202]  This is where we are now as a society, from the Chicago Tribune.
[00:13:57.623 --> 00:14:00.886]  And then they report it with a straight face, you see.
[00:14:01.426 --> 00:14:03.769]  And that's what Nambla said 30 years ago.
[00:14:03.809 --> 00:14:08.353]  They wrote books, they got entrance to the UN as a non-governmental organization, NGO.
[00:14:09.054 --> 00:14:11.777]  And they say, and it goes back to B.F.
[00:14:11.837 --> 00:14:17.763]  Skinner, and it goes back to Julian Huxley, it goes back to all of them.
[00:14:19.122 --> 00:14:34.501]  Saying that this is how we're going to break down the family and break down society is creating a social welfare system where we can then basically grow these different artificial political groups, totally drug people out, whack them out.
[00:14:35.342 --> 00:14:44.445]  And then say, you have to let them identify, and then protect them, and then pay for them, basically as a captured group of mental patients.
[00:14:45.205 --> 00:14:50.827]  And then when they want to go out and abuse children, it's going to be okay because it's how they identify.
[00:14:51.187 --> 00:15:03.051]  And NAMBLA is trying to get the UN and other governments, and some European countries are lowering the age down to 13 for consent, where if an adult wants to come to your door, and knock on the door, and you're a 7-year-old,
[00:15:05.214 --> 00:15:08.436]  Says, I want to go with this man and have sex, they have a right to.
[00:15:09.016 --> 00:15:10.877]  The left in California is trying to pass laws.
[00:15:11.237 --> 00:15:13.478]  First it's, oh, let your 10-year-old get vaccinated.
[00:15:13.498 --> 00:15:14.259]  They've passed laws.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.720]  Parents are like, no, you can't.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.561]  Well, I have a right.
[00:15:18.161 --> 00:15:23.384]  You hear about this emancipation of children, this whole movement is about them going into the hands of the state.
[00:15:23.784 --> 00:15:25.265]  The whole thing is pushed to do that.
[00:15:25.765 --> 00:15:26.365]  It's the cult.
[00:15:26.765 --> 00:15:27.626]  It's the program.
[00:15:27.946 --> 00:15:28.746]  It's the operation.
[00:15:28.987 --> 00:15:29.887]  And then they're reporting it.
[00:15:30.247 --> 00:15:31.728]  They're going, well, we may have to let him go.
[00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:33.289]  And so the new thing is,
[00:15:35.103 --> 00:15:51.823]  You catch somebody crawling up through your daughter or your son's window and dragging them out to put them in that van, and they're going to say, sorry, they're going to go free because they identified as a child and they're allowed to have sex with your child.
[00:15:52.424 --> 00:15:53.225]  That's what it's all about.
[00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:53.865]  It's your evil.
[00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:00.182]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:16:00.362 --> 00:16:02.764]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to secure your canister.
[00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:10.230]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.
[00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:20.659]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion Drink Mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded with a full month's supply of essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that your body absolutely needs.
[00:16:21.079 --> 00:16:28.623]  In the history of Infowars Life, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mel Vitality, and so many others.
[00:16:28.923 --> 00:16:38.868]  With its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects, this formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.
[00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:41.070]  And this part is most important.
[00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:47.613]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.056]  That means it's clean.
[00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:50.398]  That means it's pure.
[00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:53.364]  And rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowar.
[00:16:53.464 --> 00:16:56.050]  That's Infowarslife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.893]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:16:59.335 --> 00:17:00.056]  I'm so excited.
[00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:09.702]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:17:10.282 --> 00:17:15.466]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:17:15.786 --> 00:17:18.588]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:18.808 --> 00:17:27.554]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:29.675 --> 00:17:48.742]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:49.262 --> 00:17:50.563]  It is amazing!
[00:17:51.943 --> 00:17:56.925]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fucks the operation.
[00:17:58.737 --> 00:18:06.420]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.341]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:18:11.842 --> 00:18:14.182]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:18:14.983 --> 00:18:18.084]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:18:19.608 --> 00:18:31.756]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:18:32.436 --> 00:18:47.506]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:18:48.486 --> 00:18:52.209]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:54.470]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.751]  You are funding the information war in 2018.
[00:18:58.749 --> 00:19:01.530]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:19:02.151 --> 00:19:05.712]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:19:06.132 --> 00:19:09.054]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:19:09.474 --> 00:19:11.455]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:19:11.995 --> 00:19:16.417]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:19:16.737 --> 00:19:18.818]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:19:19.078 --> 00:19:25.461]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:33.303]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:34.283 --> 00:19:38.944]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:46.306]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:51.448]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:19:51.888 --> 00:19:54.729]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:19:54.749 --> 00:19:56.450]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:10.211 --> 00:20:13.592]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:13.992 --> 00:20:15.413]  America!
[00:20:15.753 --> 00:20:17.313]  It's wunderbar!
[00:20:17.873 --> 00:20:21.294]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:21.635 --> 00:20:23.115]  America!
[00:20:23.575 --> 00:20:24.095]  America!
[00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:38.120]  So, if you just joined us, we're going to be covering the latest amazing developments in Switzerland, top of the mountain at Davos, with President Trump saying, America has come roaring back, which is true, and much more.
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.080]  That video in a moment.
[00:20:40.526 --> 00:20:45.810]  But first, a man accused of sexually assaulting three-year-old girls says he's trans-aged.
[00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.932]  Then you read the Chicago Tribune, it's worse.
[00:20:48.533 --> 00:21:00.762]  He admits to sexually assaulting a six- and eight-year-old girl, but said that he identifies as a child trapped in a nine-year-old's body.
[00:21:02.184 --> 00:21:04.746]  This isn't like the Hollywood movies that are comedies like Big.
[00:21:06.347 --> 00:21:07.408]  This is the real deal.
[00:21:09.494 --> 00:21:12.195]  That ties into the big fashion they're pushing now.
[00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:17.918]  CNN promotes cuckoldry as positive for modern relationships.
[00:21:19.458 --> 00:21:23.060]  But only for the woman to have sex in front of another man.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:25.521]  You don't do that to the woman, that's a form of domination.
[00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:28.562]  But men need to do it, CNN says, that's great.
[00:21:28.582 --> 00:21:31.204]  There's a total assault on relationships, on families.
[00:21:31.744 --> 00:21:34.025]  I mean, some people are confident enough to do stuff like that.
[00:21:35.157 --> 00:21:39.779]  Most people, it ends in a divorce or a breakup, and anybody that's done any research will tell you that.
[00:21:40.099 --> 00:21:46.181]  But, oh, the women's health magazines and everything, and CNN, they show, go right out and do that with your husband.
[00:21:47.062 --> 00:21:51.023]  Let a bunch of guys line up and gangbang you right in front of him, and he's going to really love you.
[00:21:51.303 --> 00:21:55.585]  No, you're going to get a divorce, which is just what the old saboteurs want.
[00:21:56.225 --> 00:21:58.006]  And what they want, they get.
[00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:00.307]  Remember, they got your children in the public schools.
[00:22:00.647 --> 00:22:02.188]  And the shock video's coming up.
[00:22:03.007 --> 00:22:06.750]  Next segment, Google Home censors Jesus Christ.
[00:22:07.491 --> 00:22:12.315]  People thought last year, whenever Steve Crowder did it, oh, maybe it was just a fluke.
[00:22:12.676 --> 00:22:18.101]  Saying, no, he's a fictional character and, you know, other recordings saying he's a bad guy.
[00:22:18.801 --> 00:22:21.544]  Well, now Google just says he doesn't exist, period.
[00:22:21.904 --> 00:22:23.665]  Will not respond to the name Jesus Christ.
[00:22:24.106 --> 00:22:24.967]  Shall we have a new video?
[00:22:26.209 --> 00:22:28.910]  That's a Kelland and Brink article up on Infowars.com.
[00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:29.670]  Shock video.
[00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:30.251]  Google Home.
[00:22:30.331 --> 00:22:30.791]  Censors.
[00:22:30.831 --> 00:22:31.471]  Jesus Christ.
[00:22:31.491 --> 00:22:33.152]  Just can't even be discussed.
[00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:37.174]  But Mohammed and Buddha and everybody else is A-OK.
[00:22:38.154 --> 00:22:42.176]  Oprah Winfrey came out and said she couldn't run for president.
[00:22:42.196 --> 00:22:43.196]  It's not in her DNA.
[00:22:43.636 --> 00:22:46.818]  Yeah, I say women reporting that you bring women to Weinstein.
[00:22:47.378 --> 00:22:49.659]  You have hundreds of witnesses saying he rapes women.
[00:22:49.979 --> 00:22:51.700]  And you got pictures of you sticking your tongue in his ear.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.801]  Your whole sordid past, Cupcake,
[00:22:57.146 --> 00:22:57.646]  Give me a break.
[00:22:57.926 --> 00:23:02.988]  And look, if Yoko Ono wants to talk about her two-year sexual relationship with Hillary Clinton, she's being honest.
[00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:08.671]  And if you want to talk about your sexual relationship with Harvey Weinstein,
[00:23:09.781 --> 00:23:11.662]  And with the Clintons reportedly.
[00:23:12.122 --> 00:23:13.403]  That's just reported, I've heard that.
[00:23:14.763 --> 00:23:22.607]  Lady, it's okay to be a single woman or whatever out doing this stuff, but see, oh, like Trump said, I know Oprah, don't think she's going to be running for president.
[00:23:22.627 --> 00:23:23.288]  Started laughing.
[00:23:23.628 --> 00:23:28.470]  And that leads me to the next article that I'm going to get to coming up.
[00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.151]  Oh my gosh, CNN's got a new poll.
[00:23:32.132 --> 00:23:34.333]  They've got a new little thing that they've invented.
[00:23:35.973 --> 00:23:40.956]  And that's that, oh, Bernie Sanders... White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[00:23:41.137 --> 00:23:51.524]  But I know how to loot colleges, have a whole bunch of million-dollar houses, and what, six different hundred-thousand-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-
[00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:06.506]  They say he beat Trump and so did Biden and so did Elizabeth Warren and the Easter Bunny.
[00:24:06.526 --> 00:24:12.649]  Those are the same people that told us Hillary was going to win by 15-20 points and admittedly oversampled.
[00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:21.394]  You are fake news, very fake news, and of course the President also, we have that clip coming up, when Ashton DeVos
[00:24:22.873 --> 00:24:27.837]  About whether or not he thought about firing Mueller when Mueller is absolutely a floundering joke.
[00:24:28.377 --> 00:24:31.139]  He said, typical New York Times fake news.
[00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.180]  Totally fake.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.924]  Someone talked to a lawyer that says they heard Trump talk about firing him.
[00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:39.966]  And then that's not even true.
[00:24:41.055 --> 00:24:43.657]  And I know the people that have talked to Trump about it, and he's disagreed with them.
[00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:46.500]  That's one of the things Roger Stone's so far been wrong about.
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.341]  I hope he stays wrong, because he might end up being right.
[00:24:49.002 --> 00:24:52.725]  You know, he's told Trump, fire him, fire him, it's a fraud, he's going into your private finances.
[00:24:53.146 --> 00:24:55.648]  You know, Rosenstein's a Democratic operative, so is McCabe.
[00:24:55.928 --> 00:24:58.250]  Get rid of them all, it's a cabal, and it's all come out.
[00:24:58.290 --> 00:24:59.111]  He's right about that.
[00:25:01.032 --> 00:25:10.502]  The problem is that then it's the perception, especially when Mueller's destroying himself, you don't interrupt your enemy when they're destroying themselves.
[00:25:11.163 --> 00:25:13.265]  So Trump all along has said, no, I've done anything.
[00:25:13.305 --> 00:25:14.006]  I could care less.
[00:25:14.306 --> 00:25:15.107]  The guy's a joke.
[00:25:15.127 --> 00:25:17.450]  He'll hang himself with his own, you know, behavior.
[00:25:19.059 --> 00:25:19.779]  Trump never said that.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.122]  But again, that's more fake news to act like he scared of Mueller to prop that up.
[00:25:24.142 --> 00:25:29.526]  And now the media is saying it's conspiracy theories when senators read the texts that are public.
[00:25:30.246 --> 00:25:32.427]  Oh, and that we're going to get somebody killed if we keep reading them.
[00:25:33.128 --> 00:25:35.369]  So that means they're going to gear up a false flag, in my view.
[00:25:35.629 --> 00:25:36.730]  But right now, let's go to a few minutes.
[00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.251]  I'm going to play more of it coming up.
[00:25:38.291 --> 00:25:42.314]  President Trump saying America is coming roaring back, just like he said he would do.
[00:25:42.514 --> 00:25:43.735]  I'm going to cheerlead for America.
[00:25:43.755 --> 00:25:46.797]  I'm going to get all these CEOs to move stuff back to the U.S.
[00:25:47.955 --> 00:25:52.762]  And the media sputtered, oh he's going to be a globalist, he sold out, all you Alex Jones idiots.
[00:25:53.463 --> 00:25:54.785]  No he didn't scumbags.
[00:25:55.126 --> 00:25:58.872]  We know you're a pack of liars and that's why you hate us, that's why you hate Trump.
[00:25:59.855 --> 00:26:06.137]  America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America.
[00:26:07.117 --> 00:26:11.019]  We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.
[00:26:11.719 --> 00:26:15.680]  We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:22.322]  We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable.
[00:26:22.482 --> 00:26:27.344]  And we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.
[00:26:28.304 --> 00:26:33.950]  We have the best colleges and universities in the world, and we have the best workers in the world.
[00:26:34.531 --> 00:26:36.413]  Energy is abundant and affordable.
[00:26:37.054 --> 00:26:40.477]  There has never been a better time to do business in America.
[00:26:41.398 --> 00:26:48.886]  We are also making historic investments in the American military, because we cannot have prosperity without security.
[00:26:49.987 --> 00:27:03.917]  To make the world safer from rogue regimes, terrorism, and revisionist powers, we are asking our friends and allies to invest in their own defenses and to meet their financial obligations.
[00:27:05.189 --> 00:27:06.950]  Our common security.
[00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.530]  Thank you.
[00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.051]  In other words, America is back.
[00:27:10.511 --> 00:27:11.612]  Move, bitch!
[00:27:11.952 --> 00:27:13.132]  Get out the way!
[00:27:13.373 --> 00:27:14.473]  Get out the way!
[00:27:14.773 --> 00:27:15.834]  Get out the way!
[00:27:15.854 --> 00:27:18.155]  That's the globalists suppressing us.
[00:27:19.015 --> 00:27:20.916]  China with lower taxes than us.
[00:27:21.616 --> 00:27:29.800]  That is an internal tariff on our country that our Congress and the Democrat and Republican parties put in as a
[00:27:31.564 --> 00:27:39.952]  Down payment to the Communist Chinese Party to let them move jobs over there and then shit on the boards of those companies getting massive amounts of money.
[00:27:41.113 --> 00:27:51.923]  Trillions of dollars in the last 30-40 years out of China to the people that sold our country's industrial base out to that Communist authoritarian country at the expense of their own people and the American worker.
[00:27:52.748 --> 00:27:57.772]  Not free flow, not some factories, not some jobs, not building up China to have them as a trading partner.
[00:27:57.853 --> 00:27:58.053]  No.
[00:27:58.693 --> 00:28:00.775]  All one-sided, one way.
[00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:02.417]  That's how you bring America to heel.
[00:28:03.718 --> 00:28:08.242]  That's how the globalists sat around in their boardrooms decades and decades ago.
[00:28:08.282 --> 00:28:10.103]  They all wrote books about it like you were idiots.
[00:28:10.524 --> 00:28:11.685]  We're going to create global government.
[00:28:11.705 --> 00:28:16.509]  We're going to create more interdependence, more trilateral systems.
[00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:17.530]  That's not
[00:28:18.951 --> 00:28:19.511]  Unilateral.
[00:28:19.571 --> 00:28:21.452]  It's not bilateral between two countries.
[00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:29.117]  It's trilateral, meaning two countries in a multinational corporate group that's secret that makes the decisions.
[00:28:29.577 --> 00:28:30.277]  Trilateral.
[00:28:30.337 --> 00:28:35.200]  Your countries make agreements and pass their powers into Davos.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:36.581]  Into the WTO.
[00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:37.842]  Into the IMF.
[00:28:38.242 --> 00:28:39.062]  Into the World Bank.
[00:28:39.463 --> 00:28:40.843]  Into the TPP.
[00:28:42.124 --> 00:28:43.625]  No, no, no.
[00:28:44.901 --> 00:28:46.383]  No, no, no.
[00:28:47.144 --> 00:28:49.528]  You will be destroyed, EU.
[00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:52.291]  TPP?
[00:28:52.492 --> 00:28:53.233]  More straight ahead.
[00:28:58.112 --> 00:29:01.975]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:29:02.536 --> 00:29:09.942]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:29:10.643 --> 00:29:15.347]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:29:15.947 --> 00:29:17.849]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:21.912]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:29:22.713 --> 00:29:25.175]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:29:25.856 --> 00:29:32.500]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:40.344]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:29:41.204 --> 00:29:47.868]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:29:48.428 --> 00:29:49.509]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:29:49.889 --> 00:29:51.710]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[00:29:52.531 --> 00:29:55.477]  Head to Infowarslife.com and secure your bottle now.
[00:29:56.018 --> 00:29:57.742]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[00:29:59.204 --> 00:30:00.825]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:30:00.865 --> 00:30:01.765]  Another, Matt, go ahead.
[00:30:01.805 --> 00:30:16.490]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic, and that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the InfoWars.
[00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:24.032]  It might seem like a simple thing, but particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[00:30:24.172 --> 00:30:24.612]  Well, thank you.
[00:30:24.653 --> 00:30:29.578]  My favorite new one is the Don't Tread on Me, but instead it says Won't Tread on Me.
[00:30:29.598 --> 00:30:32.180]  And it's a big Dayglo snake, Gadsden snake.
[00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:35.504]  And then it's got the American flag, Infowars.com on the right arm.
[00:30:35.864 --> 00:30:42.011]  I mean, that's a great way just to meet like-minded people and spread the word and also exercise free speech.
[00:30:42.171 --> 00:30:44.814]  And the newest one is Trigger Warning T-shirt.
[00:30:45.314 --> 00:30:51.879]  Trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger, with a yield sign and then InfoWars.com on the back.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:56.863]  That is the new Shirt of the Mind, available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:58.024 --> 00:31:00.026]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:31:00.126 --> 00:31:00.426]  Go ahead.
[00:31:00.785 --> 00:31:02.926]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:31:02.946 --> 00:31:05.967]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:31:06.808 --> 00:31:07.908]  It just gets old, man.
[00:31:08.228 --> 00:31:09.949]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.731]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:16.972]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:31:16.992 --> 00:31:19.494]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:31:20.294 --> 00:31:22.635]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:31:22.975 --> 00:31:24.076]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:25.216]  Us being shut down?
[00:31:25.456 --> 00:31:26.497]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:27.957]  You know what, Alex?
[00:31:28.017 --> 00:31:29.078]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:31:29.098 --> 00:31:29.918]  Hey, Frank!
[00:31:30.198 --> 00:31:35.559]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:31:35.859 --> 00:31:40.140]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:43.241]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:43.881]  You understand?
[00:31:43.981 --> 00:31:45.241]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:31:45.622 --> 00:31:46.742]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:31:47.742 --> 00:31:52.645]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:54.026]  Do you understand?

[00:31:55.707 --> 00:31:57.208]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!

[00:33:01.803 --> 00:33:04.484]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:27.322 --> 00:33:35.046]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:45.356]  Later in the broadcast, I'm going to air all of Trump's very important 16-minute speech that he gave today at Davos.
[00:33:46.517 --> 00:33:49.899]  So that is going to be coming up and the media is already spinning it.
[00:33:49.999 --> 00:33:55.122]  Oh look, Trump's selling out his Patriot constituents.
[00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:59.365]  He's saying that he would renegotiate and look at renegotiating TPP.
[00:34:00.125 --> 00:34:02.347]  Trump said exactly that during the campaign.
[00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:05.769]  He said it's secret, it's trilateral,
[00:34:07.642 --> 00:34:11.243]  Meaning governments get together and waive their rights into some secretive group.
[00:34:12.203 --> 00:34:14.444]  The pieces of it we've seen are horrible deals.
[00:34:15.104 --> 00:34:23.887]  I'm all about business deals with other nations and having agreements with those nations once we all, bilaterally or unilaterally, work it out.
[00:34:26.088 --> 00:34:27.688]  Trump today, the President says the U.S.
[00:34:27.748 --> 00:34:30.809]  is open for business and says joining TPP is possible.
[00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.011]  And again, they're spinning that like he sold us out, just like they said
[00:34:36.092 --> 00:34:46.517]  A month ago, three weeks ago, oh, he's selling us out on DACA, he's gonna let chain migration happen, he's gonna let people that just got here stay, and then he didn't go with that because that's what they tried.
[00:34:47.329 --> 00:35:07.435]  And then he says again at Davos, I'll look at 800,000 to 1,000,008 people that have proven they've been here for decades, aren't criminals, contributors, absolutely, we're not going to kick you out, but we're going to end all this illegal immigration after that, and we're going to end just bringing people in and chain migration and bringing in their whole families, and we're going to deport people that are frauds.
[00:35:07.835 --> 00:35:09.435]  That's always been what he said.
[00:35:09.735 --> 00:35:11.656]  The media would misrepresent what he said.
[00:35:13.151 --> 00:35:16.613]  To make it look extreme and racist and everything else.
[00:35:16.974 --> 00:35:18.014]  I am on the air every day.
[00:35:18.495 --> 00:35:19.275]  I play the clips.
[00:35:19.475 --> 00:35:20.136]  I live this.
[00:35:20.296 --> 00:35:20.776]  I watch it.
[00:35:20.976 --> 00:35:22.137]  You can go pull up the clips.
[00:35:22.657 --> 00:35:28.161]  That's what was so frustrating is, if anything, Trump was almost too liberal on immigration.
[00:35:29.662 --> 00:35:37.788]  He just had things like the wall to signify sovereignty and that we're allowed to exist and he pointed out there's a lot of crime coming in out of Latin America, which is true.
[00:35:38.128 --> 00:35:39.509]  The media seized on that.
[00:35:41.004 --> 00:35:47.326]  And it boomeranged around and some reactionary nationalists got on Trump's bandwagon even more, but I'm digressing.
[00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:49.947]  He hasn't let us down yet.
[00:35:51.327 --> 00:35:56.949]  And he's right there at Davos negotiating to get those companies here and Apple just announced $350 billion.
[00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:07.973]  But still, they go into high gear with more fake news and say that he wanted to fire Robert Mueller, not from his lawyer,
[00:36:09.198 --> 00:36:13.821]  Not from the lawyer's assistant, but somebody that supposedly talked to the lawyer.
[00:36:14.441 --> 00:36:38.415]  I mean, I could say, I talked to somebody that talked to a woman in the Oval Office, and two nights ago, three nights ago, Donald Trump raped a woman, and then brought a wood chipper in, and put her body into a wood chipper, and then put the chunks of meat into a blender, and blended it up, and then like Tuck Butford, you know, with the whole Stephen Colbert Show, rubbed blood all over him.
[00:36:40.063 --> 00:36:41.644]  And then would the New York Times run with that?
[00:36:42.165 --> 00:36:48.170]  Alex Jones talked to somebody who claims anonymously that they heard that Trump's murdering women inside the White House.
[00:36:49.251 --> 00:36:54.276]  And so Trump's response was, well, here's his response, claiming that he was going to fire Mueller.
[00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:57.166]  Excuse me?
[00:36:57.266 --> 00:37:01.368]  Mr. President, did you order Robert Mueller fired?
[00:37:01.408 --> 00:37:04.851]  Mr. President, did you speak to Robert Mueller?
[00:37:04.911 --> 00:37:08.253]  What did you want to fire Robert Mueller?
[00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:09.174]  Fake news, folks.
[00:37:09.374 --> 00:37:10.175]  Fake news.
[00:37:10.275 --> 00:37:11.916]  What's your message today?
[00:37:11.936 --> 00:37:14.898]  Typical New York Times fake stories.
[00:37:14.918 --> 00:37:15.558]  Mr. Trump?
[00:37:15.598 --> 00:37:17.900]  My message is peace and prosperity.
[00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:19.621]  That's what we have.
[00:37:19.661 --> 00:37:20.922]  We have a tremendous crowd.
[00:37:21.162 --> 00:37:23.184]  A crowd like they've never had before.
[00:37:24.485 --> 00:37:48.396]  Yeah, so Trump shows up in Davos and suddenly it's not a failure, it's a winner, but it's now an engine promoting nation states, sovereignty, and the unelected head of the EU, Juncker, who I know, a little birdie told me, when Trump talked to Juncker, Trump's gonna say, well, you said I'd fail in a year and America would never come back, and by the way, you're not elected, so I guess the people of Europe can't fire you, and that's why
[00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:53.551]  Juncker didn't show up because she knew that Trump was going to get in his face.
[00:37:53.911 --> 00:37:55.412]  But guess who did show up?
[00:37:55.532 --> 00:37:57.693]  And the audio is on Infowars.com.
[00:37:57.713 --> 00:37:58.753]  It was Bloomberg Radio.
[00:38:00.734 --> 00:38:08.598]  George Soros showed up and said that Trump is going to destroy the world.
[00:38:09.278 --> 00:38:12.720]  Trump administration, a danger to the world, could destroy it.
[00:38:14.844 --> 00:38:17.185]  And that he and Kim Jong-un are two peas in a pod.
[00:38:17.505 --> 00:38:21.246]  No, it was the Clintons and others that armed Kim Jong-un and gave him the reactors, and people like you.
[00:38:22.727 --> 00:38:35.792]  And he goes on to say he thinks that he'll be able to remove Trump before the 2020 election, and that Trump wants to establish a mafia state.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:41.020]  No, that's what you want to establish as authoritarian systems.
[00:38:41.361 --> 00:38:43.461]  You're the one running around trying to shut down free press.
[00:38:43.761 --> 00:38:46.942]  You're the one in WikiLeaks with it all admitted.
[00:38:48.042 --> 00:38:59.904]  Soron, I mean, excuse me, Soros, Lucifer, excuse me, Soro, Soron, the snake, Soroson, what is it, Soros or Soron?
[00:39:00.384 --> 00:39:04.565]  I just keep getting his name confused because he's just like those other people out of the unmythical evil.
[00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:06.865]  But then meanwhile,
[00:39:09.448 --> 00:39:11.089]  We have reports like this one.
[00:39:11.869 --> 00:39:16.371]  Shocking video shows migrants tortured in Libya.
[00:39:17.111 --> 00:39:23.853]  And every week I see new videos of women being sold at slave auctions up on the slave blocks and men being sold.
[00:39:23.914 --> 00:39:26.214]  And we've got videos that CNN, you know, doesn't air.
[00:39:26.254 --> 00:39:26.675]  We've aired them.
[00:39:26.695 --> 00:39:27.515]  The military sent us.
[00:39:27.955 --> 00:39:37.979]  Of them chopping up the black men and then the Muslim men, the Arabic men, making other ones eat it before they execute them, believing it will send them to hell.
[00:39:39.471 --> 00:39:43.694]  Now, these are people from Saharan Africa, but most of them aren't Muslims.
[00:39:44.034 --> 00:39:46.356]  And under the Koran, blacks are not seen as human.
[00:39:47.957 --> 00:39:54.081]  They're called horrible names in the Koran that I won't quote here, but it has to do with raisins and their heads.
[00:39:55.259 --> 00:40:00.547]  And then they get captured by the slavers and they admit that in the peace down in Sudan.
[00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:06.916]  They're mainly Christians out of Sudan that get harvested and grabbed because the Christians only have a small area.
[00:40:06.956 --> 00:40:10.741]  They used to have all of Sudan but they've been pushed all the way down into the south there.
[00:40:12.303 --> 00:40:16.346]  The Muslims come in and harvest them, bring them up, and then sell them into slavery.
[00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:18.648]  And they say, this is a good young boy here.
[00:40:18.728 --> 00:40:19.629]  He's like a 20-year-old man.
[00:40:19.969 --> 00:40:23.152]  He'll do good as a tractor in your date fields.
[00:40:23.632 --> 00:40:27.536]  And they get shipped all over the Muslim world because it's still legal in those countries.
[00:40:27.856 --> 00:40:31.839]  They have harems of slave women, and they have harems of slave men.
[00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:34.962]  And that's what an elitist Arab does, is he has black slaves.
[00:40:36.129 --> 00:40:42.731]  Okay, and so they're sold, and nowhere in these reports do they say Hillary helped overthrow Libya.
[00:40:44.951 --> 00:40:51.693]  Nowhere in these reports do they say Obama lured Qaddafi in to sell the country out, and to let them invade and take over.
[00:40:51.753 --> 00:40:54.874]  Nowhere do they point out, this is, I came, we saw, he died.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:57.760]  No.
[00:40:58.421 --> 00:41:08.426]  Nowhere in the London Telegraph or even the International Business Times will they point out that it's Muslims selling men, women, and children, including little girls, into sex slavery.
[00:41:08.686 --> 00:41:09.527]  See, that's too much.
[00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:10.948]  They won't even show you that on the news.
[00:41:11.468 --> 00:41:12.709]  But it's in some of the newspapers.
[00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:19.753]  One report was a little girl was raped by over 100 men until she died.
[00:41:22.154 --> 00:41:24.976]  But see, they show you the men.
[00:41:26.547 --> 00:41:31.069]  And they do this to confuse people because they call it migrants, so Europe will then take in the men.
[00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:36.612]  But you look at the videos, they're almost all Arab military-age men invading 80% according to Interpol.
[00:41:36.632 --> 00:41:43.096]  So what they do is, they bring in the Muslims, they let them take over the radical jihadis, they enslave the Africans, they sell them into slavery.
[00:41:44.625 --> 00:41:45.366]  At all different levels.
[00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:47.268]  Some of them have their organs taken and are killed.
[00:41:47.608 --> 00:41:49.169]  Others are put on slave plantations.
[00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.871]  Others are sold into sex slavery.
[00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:55.175]  And then they only show CNN's very precise in their operations.
[00:41:55.195 --> 00:41:56.436]  Remember, they backed the Arab Spring.
[00:41:56.676 --> 00:41:58.898]  They backed the takeover of Libya that caused this.
[00:41:59.279 --> 00:42:03.403]  Anderson Cooper, the blood's all in his hands, celebrating it, saying how great it was in Egypt as well.
[00:42:04.807 --> 00:42:16.102]  So how the shake and bake works, how the formula works, where they come in, they destabilize, they then start the slave trade up again, which the Arabs taught Europe how to do, taught the Spanish others how to do.
[00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:20.434]  Because when we kicked the Muslims out of Spain, you know, they didn't go far enough.
[00:42:20.474 --> 00:42:22.096]  They go, hey, slave trade, let's do this.
[00:42:22.497 --> 00:42:23.117]  They taught us how.
[00:42:23.178 --> 00:42:24.019]  It's all set up.
[00:42:24.339 --> 00:42:28.185]  And the transatlantic slave trade started 600 years ago once the Muslims were kicked out.
[00:42:28.805 --> 00:42:29.506]  So they taught us how.
[00:42:30.087 --> 00:42:34.433]  And then that's going on and unfolding.
[00:42:35.566 --> 00:42:37.547]  And then they go, oh my God, look at all these poor men.
[00:42:37.927 --> 00:42:38.668]  They're migrants.
[00:42:38.908 --> 00:42:40.489]  They're slaves in Libya.
[00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:41.709]  But never say it's Muslims.
[00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.430]  And a lot of them are Muslims.
[00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.492]  And then they bring them into Europe as poor babies, but they don't even bring in the guys that are actual slaves.
[00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:50.074]  They get sent off in boats the other direction, towards the Middle East.
[00:42:50.454 --> 00:42:54.596]  They just bring across on the Zodiac boats paid for by Soros, the military's men to then invade Europe.
[00:42:55.056 --> 00:42:55.917]  So it's a great operation.
[00:42:55.937 --> 00:42:56.457]  Works really well.
[00:42:58.732 --> 00:43:00.313]  I want to apologize to listeners.
[00:43:01.274 --> 00:43:04.476]  I lied to you when I told you Trump would win the election, and he did.
[00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:09.599]  I lied to you when I told you that they're admitting that fluoride's causing brain damage, and it turned out I was right.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:14.803]  I lied to you about a global government existing that was trying to take control of our country, which they now admit is true.
[00:43:15.263 --> 00:43:17.304]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:43:17.384 --> 00:43:19.805]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:43:20.165 --> 00:43:21.926]  I guess, actually, I didn't lie to you.
[00:43:22.486 --> 00:43:34.511]  And I'm on air every day fighting the globalists as they try to shut down free speech in America, as they try to derail our recovery, as they try to fold us into their world government, open up our borders, hand us over to the Islamic caliphate.
[00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:35.851]  But I'll tell you this.
[00:43:36.312 --> 00:43:44.116]  When I'm on air, I wear a sports jacket and a nice shirt because I respect the fact that you're tuning in and watching and listening to what I have to say.
[00:43:44.536 --> 00:43:47.118]  But we're involved in very, very important activities.
[00:43:48.078 --> 00:43:52.341]  And that's why I want to reach out to you right now and explain something that's so critical.
[00:43:52.781 --> 00:43:58.024]  And that if you grasp it, we'll be able to literally turn the tide even faster against the globalists.
[00:43:58.524 --> 00:43:59.085]  And it's just this.
[00:44:00.256 --> 00:44:03.479]  I'm not always wearing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:03.499 --> 00:44:18.751]  I dress like this to politically get messages out to folks that aren't awake, to spur debates, but to also meet like-minded people who are out there feeling like they're alone and don't know how many of us there are.
[00:44:19.392 --> 00:44:28.940]  It's like Martin Luther King said, it's all of us of one human race who all have incredible skills and gifts that God gave us that we bring together in the human family.
[00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:30.681]  You do incredible things.
[00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:37.766]  A few months ago, I saw media demonizing folks that put up signs at universities that said, all lives matter.
[00:44:38.566 --> 00:44:41.088]  Then they demonized people that said, it's okay to be white.
[00:44:42.543 --> 00:44:49.447]  These are universities where they're saying it's inherently evil and an abomination and satanic to be white.
[00:44:49.908 --> 00:44:51.149]  Right outside Austin, Texas.
[00:44:51.569 --> 00:44:52.870]  Texas State University says that.
[00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:59.414]  Most major universities are directing this to create racial division in this country and it's sickening.
[00:45:00.074 --> 00:45:02.036]  That's why I have designed with our crew
[00:45:02.996 --> 00:45:14.267]  Several new limited edition t-shirts that expose this evil and fight true institutional leftist based racial division and classical race war designs.
[00:45:15.031 --> 00:45:18.834]  Yeah, if you're just talking about how you're white or how you're black, it's okay.
[00:45:19.254 --> 00:45:20.455]  That's fine to be proud of yourself.
[00:45:20.835 --> 00:45:24.038]  But isn't it really great to realize we all got red blood?
[00:45:24.058 --> 00:45:25.619]  That's why the shirt is in red.
[00:45:25.999 --> 00:45:34.086]  Out here in space together, the dark blue of the night sky, but all of our red blood together ties us together and that's what makes us great.
[00:45:34.346 --> 00:45:36.828]  The globalists are creating a fake debate to turn us against each other.
[00:45:37.128 --> 00:45:39.410]  Let's come together and say all lives matter.
[00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:44.334]  The fact is it's not just okay, it's great to be human.
[00:45:45.294 --> 00:45:46.996]  Let me show you a few of the other designs we've got.
[00:45:47.016 --> 00:45:49.438]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:49.678 --> 00:45:52.221]  They help spread the word and they help support the broadcast.
[00:45:52.241 --> 00:45:53.262]  A total win-win.
[00:45:53.862 --> 00:45:55.303]  This shirt is white.
[00:45:56.024 --> 00:45:56.344]  Whoa!
[00:45:57.105 --> 00:46:03.251]  And you've got major universities, major publications like BuzzFeed saying it's milk racist because it's white.
[00:46:03.851 --> 00:46:10.658]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a white shirt that says it's okay to be white, okay to be black, okay to be brown, but it's great.
[00:46:11.198 --> 00:46:11.738]  To be human.
[00:46:27.068 --> 00:46:31.669]  To literally take minorities and turn them into the equivalent of Brown Ku Klux Klan.
[00:46:32.029 --> 00:46:35.430]  This shirt is amazing, it's iconic, and it's limited edition.
[00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:42.571]  They're all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:46:42.651 --> 00:46:56.714]  And despite the fact that all these shirts are super high quality and are destiny bestsellers, through Christmas, we're offering 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com on these limited edition shirts.
[00:47:02.734 --> 00:47:05.476]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:10.298 --> 00:47:13.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:47:42.113 --> 00:47:43.714]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live.
[00:47:43.734 --> 00:47:45.555]  We're gonna have some surprise guests here in a moment.
[00:47:46.936 --> 00:47:58.203]  Milo Yiannopoulos is joining us next hour, and then the former board member of Davos, Ted Malik, will be breaking down the latest that's happening in front of everybody, but also behind the scenes from his contacts.
[00:47:59.443 --> 00:48:00.084]  Before we go,
[00:48:01.863 --> 00:48:04.905]  Any further here, if you just joined us.
[00:48:06.006 --> 00:48:26.100]  Last segment, I covered the fact that the Islamic Caliphate Wahhabist invasion into Syria, into Egypt, into Libya, that Obama and Hillary backed, has now relaunched the African slave trade that has not gone on in over a hundred years in Libya.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.821]  And CNN will show you the people being sold as slaves, but not tell you who's doing it.
[00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:32.561]  It's incredible.
[00:48:32.862 --> 00:48:42.564]  Then, two Christians, albeit very weird and probably committed a bunch of crimes, they look guilty, you know, get caught with all these kids in their house chained up, and they go, they're Christians, they're Christians, they're Christians.
[00:48:42.844 --> 00:48:45.045]  But when the Muslims do this, nobody covers it.
[00:48:45.605 --> 00:48:46.165]  And that's wrong.
[00:48:46.785 --> 00:48:51.947]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have breaking news here exclusively.
[00:48:52.587 --> 00:48:55.028]  Right before I went on air, I got off the phone with
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:03.305]  An individual who clearly, in my research and view, in my opinion, has been targeted by the deep state.
[00:49:03.745 --> 00:49:08.448]  I personally have been targeted by the operations of these systems.
[00:49:09.489 --> 00:49:24.460]  And so, Steven Seagal joins us right now with an exclusive response to the queen of fake news and yellow journalism, Megyn Kelly, and the pieces that she has been putting out as one of the top stories in the country.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:28.343]  And his lawyer also joins us, Anthony Falangetti.
[00:49:28.783 --> 00:49:30.905]  So thank you so much for joining us.
[00:49:31.706 --> 00:49:35.189]  Gentlemen, whoever would like to speak first can, and you guys have the floor.
[00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.211]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:49:37.231 --> 00:49:46.339]  This is Anthony Falangetti, and we appreciate the time to be able to come on your show and clear the air against these false accusations.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:48.802]  And they are false.
[00:49:48.842 --> 00:49:51.284]  This woman has come out now again
[00:49:52.489 --> 00:50:11.045]  On Megyn Kelly's show, to air these completely fictitious and made-up accusations about Mr. Seagal, and it's time for us to really go through what she's claiming, this fake story of hers, and start exposing that it's just a great big lie, and there's nothing more to it than that.
[00:50:12.006 --> 00:50:18.051]  A washed-up 40-year-old-plus supposed actress with not a credit to her name,
[00:50:19.057 --> 00:50:26.684]  Uh, now is looking for her last chance, basically, uh, to be relevant in an industry that she's had no history in.
[00:50:27.285 --> 00:50:28.486]  That's what this is really about.
[00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:32.469]  She wants 15 minutes of fame, and that's why she's come out.
[00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:33.730]  That's why she's gone public.
[00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:43.139]  That's why she filed a police report for accusations, frankly, some 20 some odd years ago, well outside the statute of limitations.
[00:50:43.985 --> 00:50:46.407]  All the while knowing that no prosecution can come of it.
[00:50:46.607 --> 00:50:47.427]  So why does she do it?
[00:50:47.988 --> 00:50:51.870]  She wants a desperate hope to be relevant again.
[00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.112]  A desperate hope to get 15 minutes of publicity.
[00:50:55.132 --> 00:50:57.514]  And that's what this has been about from the get-go.
[00:50:59.079 --> 00:51:03.980]  Again, that's the lawyer for Mr. Segal, Anthony Fallon Jetty.
[00:51:05.561 --> 00:51:16.904]  All I know, Anthony, and of course we'll get Steven to pop in here live anytime he wants to, is that Lisa Bloom, it's come out in the news, even The Hill and the Associated Press and others have called it dark money taints.
[00:51:17.784 --> 00:51:25.990]  Women's accusations and then reportedly now we learned that women have been offered by other lawyers and people millions of dollars to say things about President Trump.
[00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:29.632]  Hundreds of thousands of dollars by Bloom.
[00:51:30.212 --> 00:51:34.935]  There it is, Lisa Bloom's infusion of dark money in the world of sexual assault is a tragedy.
[00:51:35.395 --> 00:51:36.156]  That's the Hill.
[00:51:36.196 --> 00:51:37.737]  That's pretty liberal publication.
[00:51:38.357 --> 00:51:42.720]  And what do you think just in general this whole movement is about Steven Seagal?
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.562]  And would you like to repeat any of the things you told me this morning or last night?
[00:51:47.362 --> 00:51:59.810]  Well, I mean, what you're really saying is that Lisa Bloom has paid women to lie about phony sexual assaults, and, you know, we have strong reason to believe that this is happening again.
[00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:06.194]  We are investigating them, and we are getting onto something very special.
[00:52:07.495 --> 00:52:12.238]  You know, it's just as interesting to me, like what you were saying about Megyn Kelly,
[00:52:12.702 --> 00:52:16.965]  Apparently, the first show was getting 6 million people.
[00:52:16.985 --> 00:52:18.827]  It went down to 2 million.
[00:52:18.847 --> 00:52:19.507]  She got fired.
[00:52:19.848 --> 00:52:21.389]  Then she got the magazine show.
[00:52:21.669 --> 00:52:22.830]  She got fired off of that.
[00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:28.754]  And from what I'm hearing, this show is dwindling and probably will end soon.
[00:52:28.794 --> 00:52:34.719]  So it's sort of a desperate attempt for her to try to come up with something to crucify people.
[00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:41.264]  She doesn't care if they're innocent or not, in my opinion, just so that she can get her ratings up.
[00:52:41.804 --> 00:52:46.247]  The thing that I find interesting is this woman is saying she was in my movie.
[00:52:46.668 --> 00:52:48.609]  There's no record of her being in my movie.
[00:52:48.869 --> 00:52:49.830]  She doesn't have a credit.
[00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.031]  We've looked through the movie.
[00:52:51.051 --> 00:52:52.131]  She's not in the movie.
[00:52:52.532 --> 00:52:55.174]  She says she came to my home in Beverly Hills.
[00:52:55.214 --> 00:52:55.634]  Guess what?
[00:52:55.794 --> 00:52:57.916]  I didn't have a home in Beverly Hills.
[00:52:57.936 --> 00:52:59.457]  So she gets the city wrong.
[00:52:59.877 --> 00:53:03.379]  Then Megan says, well, is there anything you remember about the home?
[00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:04.980]  There was a table.
[00:53:06.001 --> 00:53:07.002]  There was a table.
[00:53:08.007 --> 00:53:08.387]  Yeah.
[00:53:08.788 --> 00:53:11.809]  What do you think about that, Anthony, that there was a table there?
[00:53:12.329 --> 00:53:14.731]  I mean, you know what I mean?
[00:53:14.871 --> 00:53:15.731]  Yes, Alex.
[00:53:16.832 --> 00:53:19.433]  Yes, Anthony.
[00:53:19.653 --> 00:53:25.357]  I've been practicing criminal law for over 22 years, and I started off as a prosecutor in L.A.
[00:53:25.417 --> 00:53:26.977]  County, which I did for more than a decade.
[00:53:27.658 --> 00:53:33.541]  And when you do it as long as I have, you learn something about reading people's story, about reading their demeanor.
[00:53:34.161 --> 00:53:35.162]  And one of those things,
[00:53:35.777 --> 00:53:37.657]  is truth lies in the details.
[00:53:38.458 --> 00:53:50.060]  And this woman's story, whether it's the one in print, or whether it's the one that she gave to Megyn Kelly, the bottom line is, it's bereft of any legitimate details.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.021]  There's nothing genuine about it.
[00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:56.022]  And the lack of details shows that it's not authentic.
[00:53:56.722 --> 00:53:58.582]  Oh, what do you remember about his house?
[00:53:58.682 --> 00:53:59.182]  A table?
[00:54:00.142 --> 00:54:02.263]  You're that insightful that you remember a table?
[00:54:03.058 --> 00:54:03.458]  I don't know.
[00:54:15.103 --> 00:54:25.274]  Any single detail about the outside of this house, about the inside of the house, or even about the actual accusations, nothing rings true.
[00:54:25.814 --> 00:54:33.502]  Anthony Fowler, Jetty, I should also add, I mean, I've seen you in famous high-profile cases when you were a prosecutor and I probably should have asked that question.
[00:54:33.522 --> 00:54:35.824]  I mean, as a former star prosecutor,
[00:54:36.825 --> 00:55:05.917]  So many of these stories, there's just nothing there, and it's always 10, 20, 25, 30 years ago, and then in so many cases it does turn out to be a false, and then the media just gives it total attention, like it's absolutely real, there's no standards of justice, no standard of proof, no standard of anything, and then whoever's been accused is supposed to be destroyed, their family's destroyed, they're supposed to be fired, they're supposed to be ruined, they're supposed to basically go commit suicide, and then the media,
[00:55:06.537 --> 00:55:15.283]  I mean, clearly it's got some type of major agenda here.
[00:55:15.503 --> 00:55:28.773]  Well, one of the most difficult things is that these stories come out, they come out in the media, and as you said, there's no burden of proof, there is no
[00:55:29.403 --> 00:55:36.066]  There's no professional ethic that guides the reporting or the detail of these stories.
[00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:40.168]  There's no constitutional protections in the media for people who are accused.
[00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:46.511]  And obviously what happens is somebody has carte blanche to wheel out these claims.
[00:55:46.951 --> 00:55:50.993]  They're not subject to actual critical questions.
[00:55:51.473 --> 00:55:54.535]  And the damage to a man like Steven Seagal is done.
[00:55:55.095 --> 00:56:06.861]  Without repair, without him having any form to bounce back or really to get his side of the story out in the same fair manner.
[00:56:06.881 --> 00:56:16.786]  Oh, and of course then, when it comes out, when the truth finally does come out, then the press slowly drifts away and acts like the false accusations never happened.
[00:56:17.207 --> 00:56:21.569]  And it doesn't really provide justice to the accused in any way.
[00:56:22.254 --> 00:56:28.636]  And as I said, this woman, as long as I have been doing this, you know, this is important to remember.
[00:56:29.376 --> 00:56:42.940]  When somebody is victimized the way she claims to be, when they're victimized, even 23 years later, they're going to remember real, genuine and specific details, which she doesn't.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:47.841]  Even when she describes the event, it completely lacks any details.
[00:56:48.282 --> 00:56:49.362]  She doesn't even claim
[00:56:50.379 --> 00:57:01.227]  That she said no to the advances, which tells you that she's desperately trying to fabricate a story that in some way will draw to the appeal of people.
[00:57:01.247 --> 00:57:06.631]  And now she's suddenly come out today with some claim that, oh, he was being aggressive.
[00:57:07.572 --> 00:57:10.474]  When accusations like this are so vague,
[00:57:12.341 --> 00:57:20.074]  My meter of dishonesty rings through the roof because beggary like that is the telltale sign that someone's not being truthful.
[00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:25.960]  So you're saying, as a former top prosecutor, star prosecutor, that this is classic embellishment.
[00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.082]  Like, who knows if the original story is true and has problems, but now it's getting wilder.
[00:57:30.122 --> 00:57:31.663]  Maybe there were two guys there, five guys.
[00:57:31.683 --> 00:57:34.364]  I'm not talking about her case, but just randomly things begin to change.
[00:57:34.605 --> 00:57:35.305]  Sends up red flags.
[00:57:35.325 --> 00:57:36.546]  We've got a two-minute break, gentlemen.
[00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:45.991]  We're gonna come right back and hear from Steven Seagal on the other side, exclusively here with his lawyer, giving you the response to this big top news story here in the U.S.
[00:57:48.901 --> 00:57:50.302]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:57:50.562 --> 00:57:51.843]  You can't survive without it.
[00:57:52.043 --> 00:57:52.963]  But where do you get it?
[00:57:53.243 --> 00:57:59.025]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand-new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[00:58:15.692 --> 00:58:22.016]  Including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[00:58:52.119 --> 00:58:57.264]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[00:58:57.904 --> 00:59:03.167]  Promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[00:59:03.667 --> 00:59:04.608]  This is pollen blood.
[00:59:05.588 --> 00:59:17.835]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like runny nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[00:59:18.315 --> 00:59:22.157]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials,
[00:59:22.637 --> 00:59:26.679]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet.
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:36.765]  Just chew two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[01:00:17.276 --> 01:00:23.400]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.301]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:49.738]  So we know there's a bunch of foul play going on.
[01:00:49.759 --> 01:00:55.024]  I don't know personally about this latest thing or what happened and I want to think this person is a great person.
[01:00:55.044 --> 01:00:56.125]  I don't have a dog in that fight.
[01:00:56.605 --> 01:01:02.251]  I just know Steven Seagal and his lawyers, a former star prosecutor, what they're saying I followed.
[01:01:02.971 --> 01:01:03.751]  It has gone on.
[01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:04.872]  The story's very vague.
[01:01:04.892 --> 01:01:05.632]  A lot of it's wrong.
[01:01:05.932 --> 01:01:06.892]  Now things are being added.
[01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:10.093]  This is a short segment, longer segment coming up, so don't hang up.
[01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:11.934]  We've got a break here in four minutes, Steven.
[01:01:12.494 --> 01:01:21.577]  Steven Seagal, please repeat to the listeners what you said to me last night and this morning about what you believe is behind this and categorically what you said.
[01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:27.102]  Well, I mean, I believe a million percent of it's coming out now.
[01:01:27.162 --> 01:01:27.863]  It's in the news.
[01:01:28.343 --> 01:01:32.266]  There is a secret society within our government.
[01:01:32.306 --> 01:01:34.648]  This is a full coup d'etat right now.
[01:01:35.028 --> 01:01:36.029]  It's just secret.
[01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:45.337]  And Congress is interviewing informants right now that are talking about this, and they are completely confirming that the sole purpose of this
[01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:46.818]  I've never struck a woman.
[01:02:15.943 --> 01:02:22.790]  I have yelled at girlfriends, and I'm not a perfect man, but I'm a gentleman in many ways, I would say.
[01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:24.411]  We've had private discussions.
[01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:32.459]  You and I, if you want to repeat to folks, I mean, obviously none of us are perfect, but are any of these allegations true?
[01:02:34.406 --> 01:02:39.588]  I do not believe that I've met any of these girls except for one who is in a movie with me.
[01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:44.910]  I am a gentleman and a humble, gentle man.
[01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:48.292]  And I believe I know where
[01:02:49.371 --> 01:03:13.878]  All of this is coming from, and you know, as I've said to you before, you know, I think these are all made-up stories, and you know, I not only resent it, but this is something that is designed to destroy my life, destroy my income, destroy my marriage, destroy my children and my children's lives, and it is evil, what they're doing.
[01:03:15.521 --> 01:03:26.849]  Well, I checked in with a lot of folks that have known you for decades, and they say you're a gentle giant, super nice, super kind, super flattering, and that this is just all complete horse manure.
[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:33.074]  You know, before I just had you on or started talking to you in the last month, I made some phone calls, and they said, Steven Seagal?
[01:03:33.574 --> 01:03:35.496]  That guy is like a total gentleman.
[01:03:36.397 --> 01:03:38.138]  Just absolutely nice and friendly.
[01:03:38.578 --> 01:03:39.839]  And I asked, well, why is this happening?
[01:03:39.859 --> 01:03:42.181]  And they just said, it's all part of the modern hysteria.
[01:03:45.498 --> 01:03:46.439]  Well, that too.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:48.620]  That too.
[01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:55.144]  But, you know, like I say, there's a deeper, deeper, darker picture here going on.
[01:03:55.925 --> 01:04:12.595]  And what's really happening, in my opinion, is not just the witch hunt and the McCarthyism, but it's also, I believe, and I shouldn't be the one to say this, but I will, and I'm sure you'll confirm it, I'm also being persecuted for my political views and my political affiliation.
[01:04:14.577 --> 01:04:17.578]  We know for a fact that's happening to scores of people.
[01:04:17.618 --> 01:04:25.920]  We know there's a program and we know Democrats who have been caught doing the things that they accuse other people of get a free ride.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:30.121]  I mean, where's the media on Bill Clinton settling sexual assault cases?
[01:04:30.141 --> 01:04:31.762]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[01:04:32.662 --> 01:04:40.244]  Again, Murphy's Law, your connection is so clear at night and in the morning, but I think we've got you conference called in, maybe on the same line with your lawyer, so there's a little bit of breakup.
[01:04:40.264 --> 01:04:51.748]  I don't want to be able to recap that, add any other key points, Steven Seagal, then have a former prosecutor there in Southern California and your lawyer, Anthony Falangetti, finish up some points as well.

[01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:23.532]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:06:24.132 --> 01:06:25.454]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.081 --> 01:06:35.483]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live into the second hour.
[01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:53.936]  Steven Seagal joins us exclusively with his lawyer, Anthony Falanghetti, and Steven Seagal is responding to the big national news story launched by Megyn Kelly, who I found to be an extremely deceptive yellow journalist, the true mold of fake news in a fake news world.
[01:06:53.976 --> 01:07:02.062]  I'm not going to go into all the things she did where she'd take a question, she had 15 minutes before, and then put a whole other answer on the end so I sounded completely insane.
[01:07:02.905 --> 01:07:04.077]  Uh, but, I mean I saw...
[01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:15.167]  Videos yesterday that they were putting graphics over on CNN where they were cutting up what the president had said in a statement to make him sound crazy.
[01:07:15.967 --> 01:07:20.750]  So all I know is she's a very disingenuous person and I documented it.
[01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:26.594]  I never record people secretly, but I recorded her because it was so ridiculous when I'm obsessed with you.
[01:07:26.634 --> 01:07:27.634]  You're so handsome.
[01:07:27.995 --> 01:07:29.015]  You're so sexy.
[01:07:29.335 --> 01:07:30.476]  I said, hey, let me get to the office.
[01:07:30.516 --> 01:07:31.217]  I got the office.
[01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:31.897]  I recorded her.
[01:07:32.337 --> 01:07:34.439]  You hear the gushing, the lying, the BS.
[01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:37.157]  So, I find it very fitting.
[01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:45.381]  I don't know about this woman, and I'm just here, you know, getting Steven Seagal's statement out here, and he's brought up some really cogent points, so is his lawyer.
[01:07:45.921 --> 01:07:58.967]  But I know this, Megyn Kelly attached to this, with her show going from, you know, almost 8 million viewers to 6 million to 2 million, losing the Dateline NBC gig, now kicked to this morning program, and she can't even get along with, you know, all the leftists.
[01:07:59.007 --> 01:08:01.648]  So, I think this is a desperate publicity stunt.
[01:08:02.268 --> 01:08:06.791]  Well, I mean, I think you're right, but, you know, once again, I hate to say this.
[01:08:06.811 --> 01:08:14.776]  I think that when you say yellow journalism, the thing that is very, very heartbreaking is that we have 90 to 95% fake journalism, fake news.
[01:08:32.952 --> 01:08:36.614]  90 to 95% of the news in America now is fake news.
[01:08:37.214 --> 01:08:41.215]  So nobody, as I said to you before, nobody knows what's true and what's not.
[01:08:41.795 --> 01:08:50.339]  And when you're in a situation like that where you don't know what's true and what's not, how can you weather the storm?
[01:08:50.379 --> 01:08:51.699]  How can you walk forward?
[01:08:52.139 --> 01:08:57.041]  How can you do anything and know that you're right about what you're doing?
[01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:59.302]  How can you make a decision and know that you're right?
[01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:05.190]  If I said that Donald Trump raped me 25 years ago, there are lawyers that would give me millions of dollars.
[01:09:05.671 --> 01:09:07.593]  Would anyone take that as credible?
[01:09:08.054 --> 01:09:08.775]  Because I'm a man.
[01:09:09.736 --> 01:09:12.159]  And we know men do get sexually assaulted and it's a real issue.
[01:09:12.199 --> 01:09:14.201]  And a lot of these women have courage and have gone public.
[01:09:14.221 --> 01:09:16.805]  But in so many of these cases, they've turned out to be fake.
[01:09:17.225 --> 01:09:25.532]  We have all the leftists caught burning crosses, poop swastikas, attacking their own dorms, the Air Force Academy, and the media runs with those!
[01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:28.314]  And almost every one of those has turned out to be fake.
[01:09:28.694 --> 01:09:30.596]  You said 40% last time you were on.
[01:09:31.036 --> 01:09:36.460]  Some of the law enforcement numbers are 50% of sexual assault reports are false.
[01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:38.662]  But again, your phone's very clear now.
[01:09:38.702 --> 01:09:43.546]  Would you just, for the record, Mr. Segal, repeat what you've said on and off the record
[01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:47.427]  About this, not just your case, but the whole firestorm?
[01:09:49.728 --> 01:10:03.472]  Well, I mean, I think I quoted Michelle Milken when she went in and did, you know, extensive research into FBI files and law enforcement files, and she got crucified for what she said.
[01:10:03.512 --> 01:10:13.575]  But what she basically said is, when people make reports and accusations and file claims, they often lie.
[01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:16.452]  Sometimes they lie because they're being paid to lie.
[01:10:16.992 --> 01:10:20.535]  Sometimes they lie because they want to assassinate their enemy.
[01:10:20.955 --> 01:10:23.297]  Sometimes they lie because they want to become famous.
[01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:27.741]  Whatever their reasons are, there are many reasons why they lie.
[01:10:28.681 --> 01:10:29.422]  And, of course,
[01:10:29.864 --> 01:10:38.846]  There are those people that are, you know, really, really legitimate victims, and those people should be protected and supported in every way.
[01:10:39.327 --> 01:10:50.050]  But the people who are lying about claims for all these other reasons are damaging the credibility or the hope of the real victim.
[01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:51.410]  You know?
[01:10:52.802 --> 01:11:03.184]  Anthony Falangetti, I want to go back to Mr. Seagal here in a moment, but any other points as a former prosecutor that you'd like to make about this case, this particular one that Megyn Kelly has picked up on?
[01:11:04.304 --> 01:11:07.905]  Well, yeah, I would like to follow up on some of the discussion.
[01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:17.267]  In many ways, we are seeing in our criminal justice system today a real crisis of credibility.
[01:11:17.347 --> 01:11:21.188]  There are serious issues of credibility because people
[01:11:21.764 --> 01:11:22.124]  Are you?
[01:11:38.474 --> 01:12:02.323]  That critical moral demand that we tell the truth, and the more our society steers away from that, the more we start thinking, if I lie about something for some other reason or some other good, whether it's the good of our country or the good of my own benefit, those motives, if we justify lying based on those motives, we will have serious credibility issues
[01:12:02.876 --> 01:12:08.059]  And it jeopardizes a fundamental aspect of our criminal justice system.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:18.026]  Our justice system relies on the idea that someone will take the witness stand and look over at the judge and look over at the jury and tell the truth.
[01:12:18.626 --> 01:12:28.873]  And it's obviously my job to work through the accusations of a client or the witness's statement to help determine whether or not they're being truthful.
[01:12:28.973 --> 01:12:31.595]  Or if they're not being truthful, bring that out.
[01:12:32.322 --> 01:12:36.583]  And in this one, notice, this woman goes on to Megyn Kelly's show.
[01:12:37.044 --> 01:12:38.644]  She was not cross-examined.
[01:12:38.664 --> 01:13:00.551]  You know, the reason why in our society the right to cross-examine is so fundamental to the American justice system is that justice demands the search engine of truth, cross-examination, to be applied to accusations like this because accusations like this can destroy people wrongfully and without a fair vetting.
[01:13:01.255 --> 01:13:02.816]  Of the accusations.
[01:13:02.856 --> 01:13:10.378]  Without a fair vetting of the story, good men like Steven Seagal get accused of things they didn't do, and the media runs with it.
[01:13:10.798 --> 01:13:13.720]  And that's not what American justice is supposed to be about.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:23.563]  And on a particular area, this is a perfect example of what I find astonishing and completely absurd about this woman's accusation.
[01:13:24.043 --> 01:13:28.665]  This woman claims that when she was 18 years old, she went to an open call
[01:13:29.582 --> 01:13:30.002]  I think so.
[01:13:50.643 --> 01:13:57.666]  All by herself, and goes to a Hollywood wrap party, allegedly was what she thought she was doing, all by herself.
[01:13:57.926 --> 01:14:04.789]  She drives her by herself, she doesn't go with any friend, she doesn't go with any escort, suddenly she goes all by herself.
[01:14:05.329 --> 01:14:10.631]  And the juxtaposition of those two claims by her,
[01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.951]  Really just explodes on the dishonesty scale.
[01:14:14.991 --> 01:14:16.571]  It's obviously contrived.
[01:14:17.232 --> 01:14:18.632]  And she wants to have it both ways.
[01:14:18.652 --> 01:14:25.974]  She wants to be innocent, and then she wants to be attending this party at the same time, or thinking that she's attending the party, and it's absurd.
[01:14:26.174 --> 01:14:28.295]  Well, Mr. Fallon, that's the point I'm getting at here.
[01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:29.115]  I believe Steven.
[01:14:29.395 --> 01:14:30.215]  I've seen the climate.
[01:14:30.275 --> 01:14:31.176]  I've seen what goes on.
[01:14:32.856 --> 01:14:36.518]  Even if I didn't, which I do, he deserves a place to say something.
[01:14:36.558 --> 01:14:39.479]  He came on for an hour and 15 minutes 11 days ago.
[01:14:39.559 --> 01:14:40.839]  It got millions of views online.
[01:14:40.899 --> 01:14:41.800]  Millions of people heard it here.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.642]  No media would pick up what he actually said.
[01:14:46.102 --> 01:14:59.628]  Since when do you not even get to respond, if you're a celebrity or anybody else, to accusations, and then no one wants to even put in the news what you said that shows the massive media agenda?
[01:14:59.908 --> 01:15:00.388]  Mr. Segal?
[01:15:02.894 --> 01:15:07.595]  I mean, listen, like I said, she cannot provide a photograph of her and I together.
[01:15:08.275 --> 01:15:11.936]  Anthony, describe, how do you describe the photograph that they put out?
[01:15:11.996 --> 01:15:16.797]  Yeah, the one photograph put out is kind of silly.
[01:15:17.117 --> 01:15:30.079]  It reminds me of a movie star walking down Sunset Boulevard in a crowd of fans gathering around him and wouldn't stand a chance to take a selfie of herself or have somebody take a picture of herself with this movie star.
[01:15:30.589 --> 01:15:37.871]  Well, we know this whole movement in general by the media is to create a witch hunt to bring down the president and the American recovery.
[01:15:37.891 --> 01:15:39.411]  We need to put bookends on this, gentlemen.
[01:15:39.751 --> 01:15:41.492]  We'll be right back to finish up with Steven Seagal.
[01:15:58.851 --> 01:16:00.572]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[01:16:00.712 --> 01:16:05.275]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:06.036 --> 01:16:07.737]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[01:16:07.777 --> 01:16:10.198]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[01:16:10.238 --> 01:16:11.099]  Here is the trailer.
[01:16:11.559 --> 01:16:15.762]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[01:16:16.662 --> 01:16:19.484]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:16:19.764 --> 01:16:21.485]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[01:16:21.545 --> 01:16:22.066]  Who cares?
[01:16:25.797 --> 01:16:26.678]  You haven't been called.
[01:16:28.599 --> 01:16:29.620]  Go back to Univision.
[01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:31.662]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[01:16:31.682 --> 01:16:32.383]  Very low energy.
[01:16:32.443 --> 01:16:34.004]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[01:16:34.044 --> 01:16:38.308]  Throw him out.
[01:16:38.368 --> 01:16:39.949]  Throw him out into the cold.
[01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:46.214]  Don't give him their coat.
[01:16:46.314 --> 01:16:46.955]  No coats.
[01:16:46.975 --> 01:16:47.976]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[01:16:48.296 --> 01:16:48.576]  Lion Den.
[01:16:53.024 --> 01:16:57.565]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[01:16:57.845 --> 01:17:01.126]  The most dishonest human beings.
[01:17:01.166 --> 01:17:04.146]  These people right here.
[01:17:04.206 --> 01:17:07.607]  Look at all the cameras.
[01:17:07.627 --> 01:17:08.607]  So disgusting.
[01:17:08.627 --> 01:17:10.207]  This socialist slash communist.
[01:17:10.227 --> 01:17:10.767]  Crazy Bernie.
[01:17:10.787 --> 01:17:14.408]  He's crazy as it may look.
[01:17:14.528 --> 01:17:15.188]  Pocahontas?
[01:17:15.228 --> 01:17:15.648]  The Indian?
[01:17:16.088 --> 01:17:16.869]  Very offensive.
[01:17:16.969 --> 01:17:18.349]  I'm sorry about that.
[01:17:18.409 --> 01:17:19.049]  A Pocahontas?
[01:17:21.135 --> 01:17:22.096]  Crooked Hillary!
[01:17:22.176 --> 01:17:23.317]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[01:17:23.337 --> 01:17:25.458]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[01:17:30.822 --> 01:17:31.402]  Crooked Hillary!
[01:17:31.442 --> 01:17:33.124]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[01:17:33.964 --> 01:17:38.527]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:41.770]  This had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out.
[01:17:43.897 --> 01:17:46.039]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.022]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[01:17:48.042 --> 01:17:49.383]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[01:17:50.084 --> 01:17:51.625]  Because they were protecting him.
[01:17:51.746 --> 01:17:52.647]  I'm trying to be nice.
[01:17:52.687 --> 01:17:54.188]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:57.071]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[01:17:57.312 --> 01:17:59.113]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[01:17:59.153 --> 01:18:00.295]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[01:18:02.065 --> 01:18:04.506]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[01:18:04.646 --> 01:18:05.346]  It just doesn't work!
[01:18:05.366 --> 01:18:07.526]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[01:18:07.646 --> 01:18:10.487]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[01:18:10.507 --> 01:18:13.328]  She makes a speech for 15 minutes, she goes home, goes to bed.
[01:18:14.468 --> 01:18:16.269]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[01:18:16.569 --> 01:18:19.850]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[01:18:20.130 --> 01:18:21.070]  Repeat after me.
[01:18:21.090 --> 01:18:24.151]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[01:18:24.611 --> 01:18:25.811]  That's not going to happen.
[01:18:25.871 --> 01:18:26.711]  So help me God.
[01:18:26.992 --> 01:18:28.532]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[01:18:34.421 --> 01:18:37.465]  We will make America great again!
[01:18:38.686 --> 01:18:39.747]  Go home to mommy.
[01:18:40.088 --> 01:18:41.309]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:43.151]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:45.752]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[01:18:45.772 --> 01:18:46.533]  You've carried them all.
[01:18:46.813 --> 01:18:47.433]  You sell them all.
[01:18:47.453 --> 01:18:48.194]  They're all groundbreaking.
[01:18:48.214 --> 01:18:50.016]  But this one, this one is fun.
[01:18:50.656 --> 01:18:51.937]  And very, very celebratory.
[01:18:51.957 --> 01:18:54.499]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[01:18:54.519 --> 01:18:55.380]  It's really a special film.
[01:18:56.441 --> 01:18:56.921]  Thanks a lot.
[01:18:56.961 --> 01:19:01.745]  Look, I urge everyone, you gotta get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[01:19:02.546 --> 01:19:05.248]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[01:19:05.889 --> 01:19:08.571]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[01:19:09.131 --> 01:19:21.635]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[01:19:21.935 --> 01:19:25.097]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[01:19:25.157 --> 01:19:26.137]  That's why it stuck.
[01:19:26.337 --> 01:19:31.359]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:32.439]  I thought I knew Trump.
[01:19:32.539 --> 01:19:33.359]  I studied Trump.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:34.520]  I thought I knew him.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:37.841]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:39.582]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:29.815]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:20:30.515 --> 01:20:32.256]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.676 --> 01:20:39.379]  Alright folks, we have got Milo Yiannopoulos riding shotgun with us, best-selling author, researcher, needs no introduction.
[01:20:39.679 --> 01:20:48.563]  The balance of the transmission, we've got reporters coming on live from Davos, former Davos board member joining us, coming up Ted Malik as well.
[01:20:49.523 --> 01:21:14.700]  So much big news, but finishing up with Anthony Fallon Getty, the former prosecutor there in Los Angeles and also the lawyer for Steven Seagal and Steven Seagal, we were going to break as we were making that last point about due process and the people that have been accused of things decades later, not getting quoted even in the press.
[01:21:15.021 --> 01:21:16.662]  This is a whole new level.
[01:21:17.222 --> 01:21:18.303]  What do you think's behind this?
[01:21:20.649 --> 01:21:29.811]  Well, you know, truly, Alex, in these instances, innocent people do processes here to protect the innocent citizens of our society.
[01:21:30.191 --> 01:21:47.875]  Look, the public needs to remember that in this age where accusations are all that matter in destroying a human being, they need to stop and think that an innocent man like Steven Seagal, who did not rape this woman, who is innocent, should be entitled
[01:21:48.342 --> 01:21:48.562]  To be
[01:22:07.566 --> 01:22:10.328]  They should do their duty to ask tougher questions.
[01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:20.295]  They should actually do investigative journalism for once and look for the truth as opposed to looking for headlines or to sell their paper or to sell their show.
[01:22:20.755 --> 01:22:32.023]  And our society needs to remember that in this flood of information, they need to start looking for the truth and asking questions about what they're told and what they hear.
[01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:35.866]  This woman is making fictitious accusations.
[01:22:36.186 --> 01:22:37.127]  They're total lies.
[01:22:37.958 --> 01:22:42.601]  Steven Seagal is an innocent man, and he should be entitled to be heard as such.
[01:22:43.721 --> 01:22:44.422]  Exactly!
[01:22:44.442 --> 01:22:50.245]  I mean, I had some media that they wouldn't cover when he was on a few weeks ago, but say, how dare you have him on?
[01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:54.067]  I mean, that's like you don't even get a trial in the media now.
[01:22:54.127 --> 01:22:55.068]  As you said, that's it.
[01:22:55.548 --> 01:22:56.849]  It's a PR campaign.
[01:22:56.989 --> 01:23:00.031]  Forget this particular allegation in the equation.
[01:23:00.251 --> 01:23:06.274]  The whole thing is one-sided, and you never get to actually hear from the people being accused.
[01:23:06.394 --> 01:23:06.815]  It's just
[01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:10.557]  No, I mean I thank you Alex for hearing us out and I pray for a time where America
[01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:49.150]  Going back to the way it used to be where, you know, the innocent or people were presumed innocent until they're proven guilty and people's constitutional rights are protected.
[01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:54.755]  Nowadays, it seems like there's so many of these people that are extreme leftists.
[01:23:55.522 --> 01:23:56.142]  I don't know.
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:19.763]  It's really, really heartbreaking what's been happening to America.
[01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:23.445]  Well I have to say it, I was the first to say it earlier last year.
[01:24:23.465 --> 01:24:29.209]  And I said, they're going to burn their own, even before they did, to make it look legitimate.
[01:24:29.229 --> 01:24:30.910]  Because everybody knows they're so illegitimate.
[01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:32.551]  Hollywood has started claiming stuff about Trump.
[01:24:32.571 --> 01:24:37.154]  And then they're going to build this snowball where accusation is enough and then try to use it.
[01:24:37.174 --> 01:24:40.316]  But then even Al Franken later admitted, I've been told by Democrats, this is
[01:24:40.316 --> 01:24:41.857]  That's a thing to build up credibility to get Trump.
[01:24:42.097 --> 01:24:43.598]  Well, I may not even resign now.
[01:24:44.019 --> 01:24:46.360]  He finally said that because this is bull.
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:47.141]  They're not resigning.
[01:24:47.221 --> 01:24:48.041]  I'm not going to resign.
[01:24:48.262 --> 01:24:50.103]  So that's really what this has come down to.
[01:24:50.463 --> 01:24:53.925]  And I think it hurts real men and real women and real children that are assaulted.
[01:24:53.945 --> 01:24:57.788]  I know privately you've talked about their real assaults, real people out there that do bad things.
[01:24:57.808 --> 01:24:59.149]  You've got daughters, you've got children.
[01:24:59.429 --> 01:25:00.610]  You know, you're absolutely against that.
[01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:03.912]  And this this hurts the people that are really being hurt out there.
[01:25:03.972 --> 01:25:06.234]  So, Steven Seagal, thank you so much for the time.
[01:25:06.955 --> 01:25:08.696]  Mr. Falangetti, thank you so much.
[01:25:09.436 --> 01:25:17.518]  Hopefully the so-called media, the fake news media, will actually quote you at least one-tenth of the percent as much as they quote the people making the accusations.
[01:25:17.538 --> 01:25:18.778]  So again, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:25:18.818 --> 01:25:27.561]  No, they'll probably try to take what we say and move the words around and, you know, manipulate the words and misquote us.
[01:25:28.681 --> 01:25:29.421]  That's what they do.
[01:25:29.621 --> 01:25:30.861]  Alright, thank you so much, gentlemen.
[01:25:32.502 --> 01:25:33.022]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:33.598 --> 01:25:33.898]  All right.
[01:25:34.439 --> 01:25:36.222]  Boy, you walked right in the middle of a hornet's nest.
[01:25:36.302 --> 01:25:37.023]  No, I didn't.
[01:25:37.083 --> 01:25:39.105]  I was like, what have I walked into?
[01:25:39.286 --> 01:25:40.447]  What's wrong with Paul Stevenson?
[01:25:40.587 --> 01:25:41.809]  Oh, no, it's all right.
[01:25:42.049 --> 01:25:42.730]  It's not an accident.
[01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:43.812]  It's not an accident they picked him.
[01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:44.893]  It's not an accident.
[01:25:44.913 --> 01:25:48.218]  This is revenge from the day that Trump won.
[01:25:48.718 --> 01:25:50.878]  They came for the people who put him there.
[01:25:51.319 --> 01:25:53.639]  Bill O'Reilly, Tommy Lahren, you, me.
[01:25:53.959 --> 01:26:12.583]  From the day that election in November didn't go as all of the architecture of American public life had geared it up to be, had pointed, that horror show they woke up to, that alternate dimension that the establishment left to work up in that day, well, someone needed to pay.
[01:26:12.843 --> 01:26:15.563]  Someone needed to pay for that, and they needed revenge.
[01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:18.224]  They wanted blood, and this is a perfect example
[01:26:18.524 --> 01:26:20.225]  And it's not going to stop, by the way.
[01:26:21.346 --> 01:26:32.974]  They admit, I know they've done this to you, we should probably talk about this when we come back, we're not whining, it's pretty interesting just to know the anatomy of how they're trying to have a coup against anybody that's pro-America, pro-Constitution, classical liberal like yourself or myself.
[01:26:33.495 --> 01:26:40.740]  I mean, they have had BuzzFeed, all these other big publications for years, camped out here now for almost two years, literally talking to the dog catcher.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.183]  Ushers at movie theaters, like trying to get people to make something up.
[01:26:45.283 --> 01:26:52.390]  I have BuzzFeed reporters DMing people who were in pictures with me when I was on a college tour two years ago.
[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:52.890]  Exactly.
[01:26:53.090 --> 01:27:02.378]  Two years ago, at 2 a.m., there's a picture of me and a couple of, like, college football players in a bar late at night, and they're like, ah, I bet there's something.
[01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:03.359]  There must be something.
[01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:11.486]  So they go and they look for these people and they start, they identify the guys and start DMing them saying, hey I'm from Buzzfeed, just wondering if you have any time to talk about Milo.
[01:27:11.786 --> 01:27:15.149]  And of course these guys turn around and send it to me and they're like, what is this about?
[01:27:15.230 --> 01:27:15.570]  I don't know.
[01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:20.114]  But they have an army of people just dedicated to digging around.
[01:27:20.454 --> 01:27:21.375]  They all have their own beats.
[01:27:21.395 --> 01:27:25.699]  There's one guy who's on, you know, on Breitbart, one guy who's on Infowars, one guy who's on all the rest of it.
[01:27:26.039 --> 01:27:35.846]  And they're paid to just tease out stories from weird, you know, half-allegations from two years ago in an attempt to get revenge on the people who did this to them.
[01:27:35.926 --> 01:27:39.228]  In fact, I was telling Seagal about that just this morning.
[01:27:39.268 --> 01:27:44.432]  I said, no, they go on Facebook, they go to places where I just shake somebody's hand at an airport.
[01:27:44.752 --> 01:27:47.434]  And if it's a woman, they get her, they call, they offer money.
[01:27:47.454 --> 01:27:51.237]  And the women are contacting us, and now...
[01:27:51.877 --> 01:28:00.564]  They don't want me to get into this yet, okay, because there's stuff going on, investigations, you name it, but some of this is criminal, and we've got them, we've caught them, so I'm gonna be taking action very soon.
[01:28:00.584 --> 01:28:03.926]  No, I mean, someone walked up to me in the airport and said, hey, I'm a huge fan, can I get a selfie?
[01:28:03.946 --> 01:28:04.587]  And I was like, yeah, sure.
[01:28:05.427 --> 01:28:10.211]  And they put the video on and started chanting, like, neo-Nazi slogans to try to get me, you know?
[01:28:10.311 --> 01:28:19.118]  And I had to immediately turn around and say, how about you go F yourself, you know, and almost shove the guy away from me, because, you know, if they just trimmed out the beginning of that video,
[01:28:19.138 --> 01:28:20.379]  For people to go in, you're speaking, and guys go,
[01:28:37.618 --> 01:28:39.679]  And by that time, the video's already on someone's phone.
[01:28:39.699 --> 01:28:41.959]  They're running out the door and they're getting $10,000 from BuzzFeed.
[01:28:41.979 --> 01:28:42.879]  I'm like, oh my god!
[01:28:42.899 --> 01:28:43.780]  Which is George Soros.
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:44.780]  It's terrifying.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.740]  But here's the good news.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.061]  It ain't working.
[01:28:47.101 --> 01:28:50.101]  You're the real Nazi collaborator, Soros, you old evil demon.
[01:28:50.762 --> 01:28:55.143]  We'll be right back with Milo Yiannopoulos talking about his best-selling book they tried to stop from being published.
[01:28:55.403 --> 01:28:55.843]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:06.641]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from InfoWarsLife.com, but instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:29:07.521 --> 01:29:11.583]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:14.424]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:29:15.224 --> 01:29:18.326]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[01:29:19.844 --> 01:29:31.993]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:29:32.673 --> 01:29:47.745]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:29:48.726 --> 01:29:52.434]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[01:29:52.454 --> 01:29:54.719]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:29:54.759 --> 01:29:57.004]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:30:00.347 --> 01:30:07.632]  Remember F. Lee Bailey, the famous corrupt lawyer, known for big problems, million-dollar fines, you name it?
[01:30:07.652 --> 01:30:09.813]  Remember F. Lee Bailey on the O.J.
[01:30:09.833 --> 01:30:10.474]  Simpson trial?
[01:30:10.714 --> 01:30:11.734]  They had a white guy do it.
[01:30:12.035 --> 01:30:15.437]  Get up and say the N-word over and over and over again to the black jury.
[01:30:15.737 --> 01:30:18.399]  And that's how they got him off.
[01:30:18.439 --> 01:30:21.040]  He said the N-word 41 times.
[01:30:21.381 --> 01:30:24.122]  They aired it on court TV, ABC, NBC, NBC.
[01:30:24.523 --> 01:30:29.626]  But I remember years later airing it on talk radio and the station manager coming and saying, you don't do that.
[01:30:29.906 --> 01:30:30.667]  That's the big issue.
[01:30:31.188 --> 01:30:38.399]  CNN, MSNBC, broadcast, you name it, on CBS, ABC, they are saying every 10 minutes they're playing the club.
[01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:40.782]  Sometimes every minute.
[01:30:42.443 --> 01:30:48.846]  Of quoting the President when he says he didn't say it, saying these are S-H-you-know-what-T countries.
[01:30:49.067 --> 01:30:54.109]  Again, just like F. Lee Bailey saying the N-word over and over and over and over again.
[01:30:54.529 --> 01:31:09.117]  You can't use it, but if a liberal, fraudulent, corrupt lawyer, in my view, wants to use it to manipulate a jury, and let clearly a guilty man go free, as we now know, if you want to do that, you are a
[01:31:12.022 --> 01:31:14.182]  You're a bad person if you're not the establishment.
[01:31:14.202 --> 01:31:15.763]  But if you're the establishment, you can.
[01:31:15.783 --> 01:31:29.625]  So CNN to Inflame Emotions, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, they're all quoting the president as saying this and saying it to get people out of their comfort zone on mainstream TV to suddenly hear them cussing.
[01:31:31.046 --> 01:31:35.647]  If I cuss or a caller slips through, our stations complain.
[01:31:36.267 --> 01:31:37.507]  We've lost affiliates before.
[01:31:39.529 --> 01:31:41.831]  Because the FCC will selectively fine them.
[01:31:42.091 --> 01:31:47.234]  Or Howard Stern, if he wants to say S-H-I-T, he had to leave terrestrial radio.
[01:31:47.554 --> 01:31:48.655]  Because sometimes it would slip through.
[01:31:49.095 --> 01:31:52.738]  But now, mainstream media, they can all do it!
[01:31:53.078 --> 01:31:58.422]  Because the executives are saying, go full bore, do whatever you want, take them out.
[01:31:58.742 --> 01:32:04.806]  That's why they've got former Democrat governors on Infowars.com saying they will punch out the president.
[01:32:06.107 --> 01:32:07.247]  Hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:08.548]  They'll kill Republicans.
[01:32:08.568 --> 01:32:09.308]  This is what they say.
[01:32:09.668 --> 01:32:10.608]  And people are getting attacked.
[01:32:10.708 --> 01:32:12.248]  Hot coffee's getting thrown on them.
[01:32:12.448 --> 01:32:13.148]  They're getting shot.
[01:32:13.208 --> 01:32:13.989]  They're getting beat up.
[01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:15.929]  They're getting their families assaulted.
[01:32:16.309 --> 01:32:19.910]  And they think it's funny as they usher this country towards civil war.
[01:32:20.630 --> 01:32:30.232]  And notice the left hadn't come out that I've seen and denied the new documents that came out from the Soros group trying to trigger martial law and race riots when Obama had only a year left in office.
[01:32:31.874 --> 01:32:32.094]  See?
[01:32:32.774 --> 01:32:34.595]  That story up on Infowars.com.
[01:32:34.835 --> 01:32:36.135]  Incredible!
[01:32:38.016 --> 01:32:41.757]  I believe the President that he didn't say it, but we've seen them lie about him over and over again.
[01:32:42.077 --> 01:32:48.279]  I could say that sources say the President snorts methamphetamine in the White House off hookers' rear ends.
[01:32:48.739 --> 01:32:53.561]  Not true, but if I said it on CNN, they would all parrot it to give it credibility.
[01:32:56.822 --> 01:32:57.502]  Think about that.
[01:33:02.148 --> 01:33:06.331]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:10.074 --> 01:33:11.375]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:12.196 --> 01:33:14.538]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.626 --> 01:33:36.368]  Well, Milo Yiannopoulos is in studio riding shotgun with us for the next hour and a half, probably more.
[01:33:37.388 --> 01:33:39.809]  And then we had Steven Seagal and his former L.A.
[01:33:39.849 --> 01:33:41.129]  prosecutor lawyer on.
[01:33:41.789 --> 01:33:42.749]  That big exclusive.
[01:33:42.809 --> 01:33:48.191]  And we've got all these Trump clips in Davos as he just goes and cheerleads for America and the economy comes roaring back.
[01:33:49.761 --> 01:34:01.557]  We're not complaining as libertarians, as conservatives, as classical liberals, but when we start comparing notes on the harassment and the just the incredible stuff that not just BuzzFeed but these other
[01:34:02.992 --> 01:34:05.274]  Fake news combines engage in.
[01:34:05.334 --> 01:34:07.175]  Imagine what it's like for the president.
[01:34:08.036 --> 01:34:14.561]  Well, we have to, I think, do five or ten times as much as anyone on the left to get a comparable level of success.
[01:34:14.901 --> 01:34:18.244]  And if you think about, you know, I can't use Eventbrite to do events.
[01:34:18.304 --> 01:34:19.905]  I can't use Shopify to sell merchandise.
[01:34:19.965 --> 01:34:24.609]  I can't hold events in public spaces because leftists will threaten the venue so they get shut down.
[01:34:24.969 --> 01:34:26.830]  My YouTube, my Twitter is gone.
[01:34:27.191 --> 01:34:31.354]  My YouTube and Facebook and Instagram are all suppressed so people don't see me in there.
[01:34:31.414 --> 01:34:38.137]  And you were the pilot for all the, because you're good-looking, smart, libertarian, you were patient zero to be banned.
[01:34:38.257 --> 01:34:39.917]  I'm the trendsetter, patient zero.
[01:34:40.177 --> 01:34:42.338]  No, I mean, they're going to come for me on Facebook soon, I'm pretty sure.
[01:34:42.378 --> 01:34:44.459]  I mean, you know, it's only a matter of time.
[01:34:44.859 --> 01:34:54.723]  If you really think through all of the hurdles that people like us have to jump through for the crime of being pro-First and Second Amendment and quite liking Donald Trump, and that's really the extent of our sins.
[01:34:55.103 --> 01:34:55.343]  You know?
[01:34:56.164 --> 01:34:58.305]  And liking to crack a joke and not being politically correct.
[01:34:58.886 --> 01:34:59.846]  That's the extent of our sins.
[01:34:59.886 --> 01:35:00.667]  That really is it.
[01:35:00.747 --> 01:35:04.810]  We express opinions and views that millions of ordinary Americans hold.
[01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:09.112]  And for that crime, you know, they try to suffocate all your avenues of business.
[01:35:09.133 --> 01:35:11.314]  They suffocate your avenues of spreading your message.
[01:35:11.334 --> 01:35:13.535]  We have to work at least 10 times as hard.
[01:35:13.555 --> 01:35:15.077]  These feminists are always saying, oh, I'm a woman.
[01:35:15.097 --> 01:35:17.058]  I have to work 20 times as hard to get the same thing as a man.
[01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:19.540]  No, but we have a conservatives of revolution.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:23.444]  On the internet plantation gulag.
[01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:24.164]  No, it's true.
[01:35:24.425 --> 01:35:26.727]  We keep beating their censorship, but it's true.
[01:35:27.087 --> 01:35:31.171]  We are now, it's made us much, much more resilient and inventive.
[01:35:31.651 --> 01:35:34.454]  Well, you know, we've realized we've got to build our own empires.
[01:35:34.474 --> 01:35:36.856]  You've got your, like, you know, you've got this citadel down here.
[01:35:36.916 --> 01:35:38.457]  I'm building my own small version in Miami.
[01:35:38.477 --> 01:35:39.058]  No, you're doing great.
[01:35:39.138 --> 01:35:43.721]  I mean, you know, we've got this, we now have realized that we've got to build our own castles where they can't come and get us.
[01:35:43.801 --> 01:35:45.082]  But that's not even the worst of it.
[01:35:45.383 --> 01:35:54.229]  Whether it's like the hacking into emails, the leaking, I mean, you know, all of the various stuff, you know, oh, your email trash has shown up on BuzzFeed, your phone records are here, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:35:54.789 --> 01:36:00.594]  And then you show up at an airport in real life and people are trying to sting you, trying to, you know, run up to you.
[01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:06.078]  And, you know, I was telling you, you know, somebody ran up to me and tried to chant Hitler slogans, you know, to try to get that little clip they wanted.
[01:36:06.658 --> 01:36:10.081]  To say, oh, here's Milo with a fan in an airport, you know, chanting about 1488.
[01:36:10.381 --> 01:36:14.064]  No, actually... And it shows the left knows it's all bull.
[01:36:14.184 --> 01:36:15.345]  They've gotten a script.
[01:36:15.885 --> 01:36:25.593]  And the average leftist has gotten so weaponized, whether it's dumping coffee and screaming Nazi, or whether it's running up screaming Nazi and standing beside you, they know they're trying to frame us.
[01:36:26.152 --> 01:36:26.793]  No, they do.
[01:36:26.973 --> 01:36:30.515]  It's so terrifying, and it's so miserable, but I like it.
[01:36:30.835 --> 01:36:39.241]  One, because it makes me, it means I have to be more inventive, and it means that I'm building, you know, like you are, these, these, you know, walled citadels where they can't get us.
[01:36:39.661 --> 01:36:49.187]  But it also means we're winning the argument, and that we're winning the argument amidst why Donald Trump is in the White House, because people are looking out, they've got Infowars, they've got Breitbart, they've got Milo, they've got, you know, Daily Caller, whatever it is on this side.
[01:36:49.688 --> 01:36:55.912]  On the other side, they've got ABC, NBC, CBS, The New York Times, Daily Beast, you know, BuzzFeed, and they're saying, I believe those guys.
[01:36:56.212 --> 01:36:57.472]  Yeah, that's what we have done.
[01:36:57.512 --> 01:36:58.192]  We have achieved that.
[01:36:58.212 --> 01:36:58.973]  We've accomplished that.
[01:36:59.053 --> 01:36:59.393]  Exactly.
[01:36:59.433 --> 01:37:06.814]  They can't take the victory away, though they're trying to put us six feet under politically and probably even physically.
[01:37:06.834 --> 01:37:08.034]  And commercially, especially.
[01:37:08.374 --> 01:37:20.856]  You know, one of their major lines of attack, which never gets covered enough, you occasionally get a story on Breitbart saying a conservative figure X, whether it's Lauren Southern or me or you or whatever, has been banned from payment system or distribution network Y. And everyone's like, hmm, okay, I guess.
[01:37:20.936 --> 01:37:22.217]  I mean, yeah, that happens to conservatives.
[01:37:22.237 --> 01:37:24.357]  But what you don't realize is the impact, the effect of that.
[01:37:24.637 --> 01:37:27.279]  It's like we're all trying to run businesses and we're trying to run businesses on the internet.
[01:37:27.319 --> 01:37:28.439]  And it's discriminatory!
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.862]  Like a gay couple wins hundreds of thousands of dollars because somebody won't bake their cake.
[01:37:32.962 --> 01:37:34.783]  And I'm like, okay, okay, whatever.
[01:37:34.963 --> 01:37:40.747]  But then we as libertarians or conservatives are being banned, like Drudge warned years ago, to this internet ghetto.
[01:37:41.127 --> 01:37:44.549]  Where is my $500,000 from Eventbrite?
[01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:48.631]  You know, like, live events is my bread and butter, and it's so difficult to do them in the U.S.
[01:37:48.671 --> 01:37:48.811]  now.
[01:37:48.831 --> 01:37:50.692]  You know, live events is my bread and butter.
[01:37:50.712 --> 01:37:57.596]  Where's my $500,000 from Eventbrite for banning me on ideological grounds from a service that they say is, you know, whatever.
[01:37:57.676 --> 01:37:57.896]  Anyway.
[01:37:58.577 --> 01:38:03.960]  Two different venues just ignored their contract with Cernovich in New York last week, and he had to get a third one.
[01:38:04.740 --> 01:38:06.361]  I mean, this is the new system?
[01:38:06.441 --> 01:38:15.208]  I was texting him at midnight, putting him in touch with my agent and my manager and my booking guy, saying, like, I don't know if they can help with this late notice, but, you know, dude, my resources are your resources.
[01:38:15.228 --> 01:38:28.037]  You know, you've wanted to do some shows with me, and I kind of am in the Citadel mode, and I'm like, yeah, I mean, I know it'd be a huge event, you know, you're great, you don't really need me, but now I see we probably need to do them just to still do it, to exercise it as a right, or we're going to lose it.
[01:38:28.277 --> 01:38:28.757]  We should do it.
[01:38:28.957 --> 01:38:33.300]  It's like black people saying, I'm sitting at the front of the bus or I'm going to eat at the lunch counter.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:39.043]  The left is so... It would have been deranged to say that like 10 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
[01:38:39.423 --> 01:38:51.390]  And now, you know, now discrimination on the basis of skin color, sexuality, gender, race has basically disappeared in America to be replaced by discrimination on the basis of political viewpoint.
[01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:55.976]  We are absolutely, you know, the new Rosa Parks.
[01:38:56.016 --> 01:38:56.897]  I'm sorry to say it.
[01:38:57.598 --> 01:39:03.807]  Since you say that, I did an hour and 38 minutes not plugging one thing, because we have a tendency to do that as well.
[01:39:04.128 --> 01:39:06.631]  You haven't plugged Dangerous, your book that they
[01:39:07.372 --> 01:39:14.359]  It was number one on Amazon, in what, the top ten New York Times bestseller list before it even came out, in pre-orders, and they banned the book.
[01:39:14.379 --> 01:39:15.460]  You had to self-publish.
[01:39:15.821 --> 01:39:16.301]  Same thing.
[01:39:16.541 --> 01:39:18.503]  They found out I have a book proposal out with Neil Strauss.
[01:39:18.824 --> 01:39:21.206]  He says he's never in his whole experience... They leaked it just now.
[01:39:21.266 --> 01:39:22.007]  I saw it a few days ago.
[01:39:22.067 --> 01:39:26.151]  And then the publisher said, sorry, he said he's never seen a book banned before the deal was made.
[01:39:26.351 --> 01:39:28.733]  No, before it's even been pitched in some cases.
[01:39:29.613 --> 01:39:34.877]  There are publishers who hadn't even heard of it yet, who are now like... Like they learnt their lesson from Milo.
[01:39:35.397 --> 01:39:43.803]  So what people need to do is they need to go to mfulworthstore.com and fund both of us, and all order Dangerous, and give it to college students you know that are really being brainwashed.
[01:39:44.083 --> 01:39:45.665]  Read it, donate it to your local library.
[01:39:46.425 --> 01:39:49.806]  To reach more people, getdangerousinfowarestore.com.
[01:39:50.106 --> 01:39:52.507]  Wherever you get it, go to Milo's website.
[01:39:52.827 --> 01:39:57.508]  Because again, just like Drudge came here two years ago and said, look, you better only focus on your own areas.
[01:39:58.248 --> 01:40:02.550]  InfoWars and expanding that because they're coming to take everything away from you and now they're doing it.
[01:40:03.370 --> 01:40:09.072]  People should go get a Milo Show annual or monthly membership to support your broadcast so you can then venture outside the castle.
[01:40:09.532 --> 01:40:10.272]  It's people that are
[01:40:10.572 --> 01:40:13.014]  Originally funding us by the supplement.
[01:40:13.034 --> 01:40:17.177]  We've got bodies, one of the strongest, best turmeric blends out there.
[01:40:17.718 --> 01:40:19.880]  Whole body support, that just came in 50% off.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:26.145]  We have the pollen block from the Japanese quail that they then feed a proprietary special diet.
[01:40:26.625 --> 01:40:34.191]  In France, it's been known to massively reduce all the different problems you have from seasonal discomfort from the pollen and all the garbage that's out there.
[01:40:34.491 --> 01:40:35.352]  This stuff is incredible.
[01:40:35.652 --> 01:40:36.613]  It's 51% off, $17.76 out of the gate.
[01:40:36.633 --> 01:40:37.254]  We need your support!
[01:40:40.416 --> 01:40:45.462]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:40:45.722 --> 01:40:47.604]  I had a caller about two weeks ago named Frank.
[01:40:47.624 --> 01:40:49.186]  I've been calling him for over a decade.
[01:40:49.747 --> 01:40:50.628]  And he was mad.
[01:40:50.648 --> 01:40:54.773]  He goes, I'm sick of you talking about you brag how you're under attack and you know how important you are.
[01:40:54.793 --> 01:40:55.213]  And I'm like, dude,
[01:40:55.213 --> 01:40:56.153]  Dude, I'm not doing that!
[01:40:56.373 --> 01:40:59.834]  They're having congressional hearings saying they want me completely banned.
[01:41:00.034 --> 01:41:01.455]  The Democrats want me arrested.
[01:41:01.475 --> 01:41:02.295]  They're suing me.
[01:41:02.635 --> 01:41:05.496]  Literally, Hillary Clinton's law firm, wait till it comes out, I can't talk about it yet.
[01:41:05.836 --> 01:41:07.857]  I said, listen, I'm under attack, Frank!
[01:41:08.357 --> 01:41:10.137]  Okay, they banned us off Google Ads.
[01:41:10.157 --> 01:41:11.538]  We were bringing five million in a year.
[01:41:11.798 --> 01:41:12.778]  It cost a lot to run this.
[01:41:12.938 --> 01:41:14.839]  They're just chopping off all my tentacles.
[01:41:15.079 --> 01:41:18.060]  I keep growing more as fast as I can, and as fast as I cut them off.
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:19.820]  I'm shooting out tentacles.
[01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:23.242]  But if you guys just fund us and buy the product, it's over.
[01:41:23.342 --> 01:41:25.242]  And they hack attack the... I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[01:41:25.442 --> 01:41:26.703]  No, no, no.
[01:41:27.083 --> 01:41:28.623]  Tell Frank why we need support.
[01:41:28.643 --> 01:41:29.204]  Tell him right there.
[01:41:29.244 --> 01:41:29.524]  Frank.
[01:41:29.884 --> 01:41:31.024]  Frank, you're an idiot.
[01:41:31.564 --> 01:41:33.105]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:41:33.145 --> 01:41:33.525]  Oh, this one?
[01:41:33.785 --> 01:41:35.065]  Frank, this is not bragging.
[01:41:35.446 --> 01:41:39.127]  We don't say, oh, we're under attack for attention or because we like the attention.
[01:41:39.147 --> 01:41:40.627]  Although, of course, everybody likes a little bit of attention.
[01:41:40.667 --> 01:41:41.027]  It's nice.
[01:41:41.388 --> 01:41:42.468]  But now it's about survival.
[01:41:42.888 --> 01:41:43.949]  No, it is about survival.
[01:41:44.009 --> 01:41:45.510]  I mean, look, think about this, right?
[01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:48.052]  You're trying to run a business online.
[01:41:48.072 --> 01:41:51.015]  You're trying, you know, to save the civilization you love.
[01:41:51.215 --> 01:41:57.700]  What gets me up in the morning is I think America is the best country in the history of human civilization and I really, really, really hate the left and I want to see them suffer.
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:42:02.423]  I want to see them curled into a little ball in the corner of the room with a crowd kicking them to death.
[01:42:02.764 --> 01:42:03.945]  And that's what gets me up every morning.
[01:42:04.525 --> 01:42:15.152]  But I can't do TV, and I can't do radio, and I can't publish books, and I can't sell anything, and I can't do live events, because they systematically strangle you out of existence using every... Where are the heretics?
[01:42:15.252 --> 01:42:17.733]  Exactly, using every resource at their disposal.
[01:42:17.773 --> 01:42:21.616]  So it's not bragging, it's a daily reality, and that's why you've got to support things like Infowars and...
[01:42:22.276 --> 01:42:24.457]  Sure, and we didn't do it for the last hour and thirty-something minutes.
[01:42:24.477 --> 01:42:24.978]  We're doing it now.

[01:42:39.626 --> 01:42:41.247]  Listen, everybody wants somebody to fight?
[01:42:44.269 --> 01:42:46.493]  We're fighting and we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:42:46.573 --> 01:42:50.821]  All we're saying is we kicked their ass but they're doubling down on us to make examples of us.
[01:42:51.142 --> 01:42:54.688]  If you make examples of us and fund us, we will be victorious and you win.
[01:42:54.908 --> 01:42:55.950]  We'll be back with Milo.
[01:42:58.228 --> 01:43:06.893]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[01:43:06.953 --> 01:43:07.413]  That's right.
[01:43:07.493 --> 01:43:12.496]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Rites freeze dryers.
[01:43:12.756 --> 01:43:19.180]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:26.727]  And let me tell you something, it is perfect for freeze drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[01:43:27.027 --> 01:43:27.207]  Woo!
[01:43:27.267 --> 01:43:28.188]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:43:28.308 --> 01:43:36.895]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:43:37.036 --> 01:43:45.163]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[01:43:46.624 --> 01:43:49.946]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[01:43:50.066 --> 01:43:54.028]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:55.089]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:43:55.249 --> 01:43:57.831]  Check it out right now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:58.908 --> 01:43:59.629]  I'm so excited.
[01:43:59.709 --> 01:44:09.275]  The new product at Infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[01:44:09.855 --> 01:44:15.039]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[01:44:15.359 --> 01:44:18.161]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[01:44:18.381 --> 01:44:27.127]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[01:44:29.248 --> 01:44:34.031]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[01:44:34.551 --> 01:44:37.333]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[01:44:37.453 --> 01:44:48.338]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[01:44:48.839 --> 01:44:50.139]  It is amazing!
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:56.503]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[01:44:58.416 --> 01:45:00.257]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:45:00.297 --> 01:45:00.637]  Go ahead.
[01:45:01.538 --> 01:45:03.439]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[01:45:03.479 --> 01:45:13.806]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[01:45:13.986 --> 01:45:17.348]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[01:45:17.828 --> 01:45:18.068]  Absolutely.
[01:45:40.575 --> 01:45:53.486]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[01:45:58.297 --> 01:46:01.078]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[01:46:01.718 --> 01:46:05.279]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[01:46:05.679 --> 01:46:08.620]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:11.001]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[01:46:11.561 --> 01:46:15.963]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[01:46:16.283 --> 01:46:18.364]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[01:46:18.644 --> 01:46:25.026]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:25.646 --> 01:46:32.872]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[01:46:33.852 --> 01:46:38.496]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[01:46:38.916 --> 01:46:45.882]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[01:46:46.542 --> 01:46:51.004]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[01:46:51.444 --> 01:46:54.285]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:54.305 --> 01:46:56.006]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:11.695 --> 01:47:13.822]  Yeah, we're good.
[01:47:20.342 --> 01:47:24.385]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:47:25.166 --> 01:47:26.587]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:26.847 --> 01:47:27.988]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:28.528 --> 01:47:32.971]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:33.232 --> 01:47:36.374]  It's Milo Yiannopoulos with the best-selling book, Dangerous Milo.
[01:47:36.814 --> 01:47:43.920]  But now you're launching your own transmission to get the word out, to not be censored, to then feed into all the other platforms.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.782]  And if people want to have exclusive access to that, how do they do it?
[01:47:47.202 --> 01:47:48.203]  Well, I'm taking your lead.
[01:47:48.783 --> 01:47:50.644]  You're my inspiration in this.
[01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:53.805]  If you go to Dangerous.com, that's all the journalism that we publish.
[01:47:53.825 --> 01:47:59.568]  Dangerous.com slash join is where you can join up to watch my new show, which is going out Monday to Friday, 4 p.m.
[01:47:59.628 --> 01:48:00.949]  Eastern, 3 p.m.
[01:48:00.969 --> 01:48:01.309]  Central.
[01:48:01.429 --> 01:48:02.450]  It's going to be going out every day.
[01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:05.431]  You can watch it on any platform, any device, any format, whatever you want.
[01:48:06.052 --> 01:48:07.232]  It's a couple of bucks a month.
[01:48:07.292 --> 01:48:08.113]  It's nothing at all.
[01:48:08.813 --> 01:48:10.974]  But together that moves mountains.
[01:48:11.074 --> 01:48:11.835]  And of course you were telling me
[01:48:12.415 --> 01:48:18.358]  I mean, you're going all over the world, selling out huge crowds of people, and you're finding the venues that are about free speech.
[01:48:18.618 --> 01:48:19.078]  Yeah, we are.
[01:48:19.138 --> 01:48:20.759]  And so we're creating our own economies.
[01:48:21.099 --> 01:48:22.140]  This is what they really fear.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:22.940]  We are.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:29.063]  You know, and it really, this should be a cause of deep and abiding shame to American citizens.
[01:48:29.183 --> 01:48:30.924]  I just came back from Australia in December.
[01:48:31.044 --> 01:48:33.725]  I did twelve and a half thousand tickets.
[01:48:34.346 --> 01:48:37.767]  I think we did eight shows in five cities, 1.5 million gross.
[01:48:37.887 --> 01:48:39.408]  It was a hugely successful tour.
[01:48:39.528 --> 01:48:42.690]  Numbers like no author has ever seen or heard of.
[01:48:43.090 --> 01:48:43.610]  I write books.
[01:48:43.650 --> 01:48:44.531]  I'm a journalist for a living.
[01:48:44.911 --> 01:48:46.312]  Journalists don't get those kinds of crowds.
[01:48:47.452 --> 01:48:51.455]  In Australia, I sold 12,500 tickets for an eight-day run.
[01:48:52.455 --> 01:48:57.258]  We struggle to do one or two shows in America because the venues cancel after threats from leftists.
[01:48:57.318 --> 01:48:58.459]  People are scared, all the rest of it.
[01:48:58.479 --> 01:49:01.340]  This is a deep and abiding stain on American public life.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.841]  Supposedly the home of the First Amendment.
[01:49:03.021 --> 01:49:08.183]  These are very dangerous authoritarians, and they're also running a very dangerous game of the Streisand effect.
[01:49:08.223 --> 01:49:17.986]  Historically, if you try to suppress something that's popular and something that's truthful, you're successful for a while, but like a beach ball underwater, when it finally explodes, it shoots 20 feet in the air.
[01:49:18.266 --> 01:49:19.107]  I like that metaphor.
[01:49:19.127 --> 01:49:20.809]  We're both perfect examples of that.
[01:49:20.829 --> 01:49:26.336]  We're both people who have exploded out into mainstream popular culture over the last couple of years.
[01:49:26.356 --> 01:49:31.201]  You know, I just watched the X-Files return and they have this character based on you in X-Files.
[01:49:31.482 --> 01:49:33.744]  I mean, you're in their heads.
[01:49:33.784 --> 01:49:35.446]  This is mainstream media penetration.
[01:49:36.988 --> 01:49:39.090]  Is it Todd something or other in that show?
[01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:40.210]  You're living in their head.
[01:49:40.511 --> 01:49:44.114]  Scully was like, you know, it was a sympathetic character by the end because he was right.
[01:49:44.134 --> 01:49:51.620]  You remember also you start off and you think they're kind of caricaturing you in an unflattering way but by the end of that season you realize he was right about you.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.722]  Well that was Chris Carter who's got a lot of courage.
[01:49:54.102 --> 01:49:56.383]  He said I like Alex Jones, he's really a libertarian, not a racist.
[01:49:56.723 --> 01:49:58.384]  That character was positive and he did do that.
[01:49:58.524 --> 01:50:05.146]  All the others, Homeland, I mean the Stephen Colbert characters, I'm gonna talk about myself all day, but I'm not that interesting.
[01:50:05.206 --> 01:50:05.687]  You're right.
[01:50:05.987 --> 01:50:16.791]  There's like nine or ten shows right now where they parody me and have me say horrible stuff and it isn't me, but then their viewers believe like somehow that's me on the street even though they know it's not real.
[01:50:16.991 --> 01:50:21.557]  But here's the thing, you know, they hear that and they think they know what you are.
[01:50:21.797 --> 01:50:24.861]  And then all you have to do is get a little slice of yourself in front of them.
[01:50:24.901 --> 01:50:33.552]  So what I always say is like, watch five minutes of me on YouTube, read one column of mine at BreitbartDangerous.com, whatever, and suddenly people are like, whoa, you're not...
[01:50:34.153 --> 01:50:40.019]  You're not what they told me you were, and the person whose reputation ends up being damaged in the long run is theirs, not ours.
[01:50:40.059 --> 01:50:46.987]  Which is why as much, you know, parody and negative attention and, you know, ridicule they try to throw at us, it only serves us in the end.
[01:50:47.047 --> 01:50:49.750]  Because, you know, here's the thing, there's...
[01:50:51.289 --> 01:50:56.173]  When in the 90s, you know, on sitcoms and TV shows, they would invoke politics.
[01:50:56.213 --> 01:50:58.595]  It would normally be at the expense of the character in the show.
[01:50:58.955 --> 01:51:03.939]  Now you've got this thin, mean, vindictive politics of Will & Grace and they're making jokes about Betsy DeVos.
[01:51:03.999 --> 01:51:05.540]  None of their viewers know who Betsy DeVos is.
[01:51:05.820 --> 01:51:11.165]  It's just unnecessary attempts at jokes at the expense of people who have the wrong politics.
[01:51:11.205 --> 01:51:12.806]  We're the only people who look bad.
[01:51:13.406 --> 01:51:16.188]  That's an astute point, because we've won the news wars.
[01:51:16.668 --> 01:51:20.451]  Mainstream media is discredited, but only 20% or so really watch the so-called news regularly.
[01:51:20.931 --> 01:51:29.737]  Now, the big problem is that they're now targeting with pure propaganda the entertainment shows, but like you said, these are viewers that tuned out of politics.
[01:51:29.897 --> 01:51:31.078]  They don't even know what it is.
[01:51:31.098 --> 01:51:31.898]  They're getting it wrong.
[01:51:31.938 --> 01:51:36.821]  You watch Will & Grace, this revival on whatever it is, NBC or ABC, and I'm watching it.
[01:51:37.662 --> 01:51:38.943]  I liked the show first time around.
[01:51:38.983 --> 01:51:40.844]  It wasn't hugely political first time around.
[01:51:40.884 --> 01:51:44.987]  It was nice, I guess, as a young gay person to see gay people on TV, I suppose.
[01:51:45.047 --> 01:51:45.927]  I mean, I wouldn't care that much.
[01:51:45.967 --> 01:51:47.969]  But it was a perfectly nice show the first time around.
[01:51:48.689 --> 01:51:54.853]  But now it's come back, and they're making these heavy-handed, everything's about Trump, everything's about Trump, and Trump in every single episode.
[01:51:55.233 --> 01:51:57.955]  And then weird jokes about Betsy DeVos's appearance.
[01:51:58.475 --> 01:52:04.019]  And you're thinking to yourself, well hang on a second, this is not only complete and total 180 on the feminist politics, you're supposed
[01:52:04.019 --> 01:52:18.469]  Well the fat shaming, just like the Young Turks called me a effing fat piece of crap, but the same woman set him up before, people that fat shame should be basically arrested, and then... That jank is hardly the epitome of 1950s idyllic athleticism, is he?
[01:52:18.889 --> 01:52:20.350]  You know, their own boss.
[01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:26.935]  No, but, you know, these vindictive attempts to smear and lie... What do they say about the press secretary?
[01:52:28.596 --> 01:52:30.757]  Oh, Chelsea Handler is, I mean...
[01:52:31.838 --> 01:52:33.239]  Chelsea used to be really funny.
[01:52:33.399 --> 01:52:36.381]  You know, she was really funny, like, like, um, what's the other one?
[01:52:36.421 --> 01:52:36.781]  Silverman.
[01:52:36.801 --> 01:52:39.082]  Sarah Silverman was really funny before she contracted feminism.
[01:52:39.463 --> 01:52:40.243]  Um, you know, they were funny.
[01:52:40.263 --> 01:52:42.465]  They were told jokes about blacks, gays, Jews, you name it.
[01:52:42.485 --> 01:52:46.427]  And it was really funny, and it was a little bit transgressive, and it was naughty, and you were like, ooh, should I be laughing at this?
[01:52:46.867 --> 01:52:47.307]  And now...
[01:52:48.248 --> 01:52:53.410]  They reserve that kind of transgressive humor just solely for people with the wrong politics.
[01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:54.291]  Just for Republicans.
[01:52:54.311 --> 01:52:54.731]  Sure, sure.
[01:52:54.751 --> 01:52:55.491]  It's funny.
[01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:58.692]  Don't even tell overweight people they might want to lose some weight.
[01:52:58.993 --> 01:53:00.113]  That's hateful, the left says.
[01:53:00.153 --> 01:53:06.436]  But then all of their comedians, all of their priests, all of their leaders literally scream and yell and call everyone fat.
[01:53:06.456 --> 01:53:07.556]  They call the president fat.
[01:53:08.177 --> 01:53:09.537]  They call the press secretary fat.
[01:53:09.557 --> 01:53:11.058]  I mean, and they're just fraught.
[01:53:11.758 --> 01:53:12.579]  They're such hypocrites!
[01:53:12.599 --> 01:53:13.819]  So where is it all going?
[01:53:13.899 --> 01:53:15.901]  I'm becoming an expert, by the way, on fat studies.
[01:53:16.161 --> 01:53:22.785]  It's a new academic discipline in some of the very most privileged elite liberal arts colleges in America.
[01:53:23.065 --> 01:53:29.029]  They've got these new programs called fat studies, where they interrogate the large body and its perception in society.
[01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:39.215]  The latest one was, something came out in the Journal of Fat Studies, which is a peer-reviewed journal, fat studies, and it said that large women, because they don't fit
[01:53:39.455 --> 01:53:41.036]  And also, that it might kill you.
[01:54:09.455 --> 01:54:09.675]  They did.
[01:54:09.715 --> 01:54:10.376]  I feel a lot better.
[01:54:10.576 --> 01:54:11.456]  Yeah, you look a lot better.
[01:54:11.696 --> 01:54:12.257]  And here's the thing.
[01:54:12.397 --> 01:54:14.598]  It's not just the left with their hypocrisy.
[01:54:14.618 --> 01:54:16.079]  It's corporate media getting in on it as well.
[01:54:16.099 --> 01:54:16.939]  Look at JCPenney.
[01:54:16.979 --> 01:54:26.285]  JCPenney, which tried to rebrand itself as a quality retailer, at the same time started putting these Ham Planet pseudo comedians in its ads, saying you can be beautiful and healthy at any size.
[01:54:26.525 --> 01:54:27.465]  That's a lie.
[01:54:27.685 --> 01:54:28.186]  You can't.
[01:54:28.446 --> 01:54:29.206]  You will die.
[01:54:29.446 --> 01:54:30.927]  You will get polycystic ovary syndrome.
[01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:31.928]  You will get diabetes.
[01:54:31.948 --> 01:54:33.309]  You will have heart attacks.
[01:54:33.329 --> 01:54:34.689]  And you will die sooner.
[01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:36.110]  And corporate America... Sure.
[01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:38.552]  Somebody 50 pounds overweight, they say dies 25 years earlier.
[01:54:39.252 --> 01:54:40.994]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:54:41.214 --> 01:54:48.200]  If you actually look at how bad it is for you when you get into your 50s, 60s and 70s, if you're like 200 pounds overweight, you're gone.
[01:54:48.220 --> 01:54:49.301]  You won't even get to your 70s.
[01:54:49.602 --> 01:54:55.888]  You look at the the negative health outcomes for people who are, you know, who are seriously overweight, it's horrifying.
[01:54:56.148 --> 01:55:01.373]  And this new thing that has come up with fat studies, which says, I've got it actually, I brought it with because I was hoping this would come up.
[01:55:02.133 --> 01:55:05.755]  Let me just read you the first two paragraphs from a book that's called The Fat Studies Reader.
[01:55:06.175 --> 01:55:14.599]  And it is a compilation of essays from academics who are attempting to rewrite the narrative around fat people as fat studies, an invitation to revolution.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:16.220]  They say that we're the problem.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:20.282]  They say if you believe fat people could and should lose weight, then you're not doing fat studies.
[01:55:20.482 --> 01:55:23.904]  You're part of the 58.6 billion pound per year weight loss industry.
[01:55:24.224 --> 01:55:36.314]  And if you believe that being fat is a disease and fat people cannot enjoy good health or live long life, you are part of the medico-pharmaceutical-industrial complex that profits from dangerous attempts to cure people of bodily difference.
[01:55:36.454 --> 01:55:43.660]  So these are people preying on folks and bad lifestyles, actually inject some more heroin, smoke some more crack.
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:44.781]  Don't let them tell you!
[01:55:44.841 --> 01:55:45.622]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:55:45.662 --> 01:55:46.923]  But you know what?
[01:55:47.003 --> 01:55:55.370]  Even the Daily Beast noticed a few years ago, when these courses started popping up at elite liberal colleges, they noticed that the people taking fat studies weren't fat.
[01:55:55.670 --> 01:55:57.532]  They were rich, skinny liberals.
[01:55:57.972 --> 01:56:00.054]  Who wanted to go manage the fat people.
[01:56:00.094 --> 01:56:00.955]  Exactly.
[01:56:01.095 --> 01:56:04.798]  See, I used to think the left, the modern left, was dumb.
[01:56:05.018 --> 01:56:05.519]  They're not.
[01:56:06.139 --> 01:56:07.060]  They are predators.
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.141]  No, they are predators.
[01:56:08.621 --> 01:56:11.204]  And this is rich, skinny, liberal women
[01:56:11.664 --> 01:56:16.406]  Who want to be able to dictate to the poor, unwashed masses, to regular Americans.
[01:56:16.426 --> 01:56:17.307]  They want to be the priesthood.
[01:56:17.327 --> 01:56:20.168]  They go, everybody's getting super obese because of all the additives and overeating.
[01:56:20.188 --> 01:56:29.933]  But don't worry, it's fine, because my daddy's uncle who owns Unilever and my mom's whatever who owns Kraft, they'll sell you the food you want and they'll sell you the medicine.
[01:56:30.473 --> 01:56:45.884]  We had Antifa come out and attack us once and I followed them and they got in Mercedes and Jaguars, $100,000 ones, and had like hot models in the car and then I learned one of them's dad is the vice president of Time Warner and another one is the owner of a bank.
[01:56:46.104 --> 01:56:47.005]  They know what they're doing!
[01:56:47.025 --> 01:56:53.415]  You're the number one profession of those Antifa, Black Bloc protesters who come out and smash towns up when I speak on college campuses.
[01:56:53.815 --> 01:56:54.416]  Professors!
[01:56:54.717 --> 01:57:02.308]  It's the school's own professors who are in there, who come out... That's because they keep arresting them and finding out they're like, leading professors.
[01:57:02.648 --> 01:57:09.135]  No, and look, our continuing attempts to try to stage a successful talk at UC Berkeley, right?
[01:57:09.915 --> 01:57:17.803]  Every time that protesters come out at UC Berkeley and they come out, the Black Block protesters come out and smash the town up, it's mostly graduate students and professors leading the charge.
[01:57:18.524 --> 01:57:20.185]  Milo Yiannopoulos is here with us.
[01:57:20.245 --> 01:57:22.985]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:57:23.345 --> 01:57:31.948]  I know you know about the InfoWars, but when you keep spreading the links and telling folks about it and putting a bumper sticker on your car, it defeats the censors and they hate it.
[01:57:32.248 --> 01:57:33.008]  They can't stand it.
[01:57:33.028 --> 01:57:39.930]  That local affiliate you're listening to on AM or FM or TV, tell people about it today at the grocery store, at your work, whatever.
[01:57:39.950 --> 01:57:40.831]  It's an InfoWars.
[01:57:40.871 --> 01:57:41.911]  We're beginning to win.
[01:57:41.931 --> 01:57:45.552]  I love the idea of just wandering into a grocery store and starting to tell people about Alex Jones.
[01:57:45.772 --> 01:57:46.993]  It's a great idea.
[01:57:47.013 --> 01:57:47.653]  Do it on camera.
[01:57:51.462 --> 01:57:54.904]  What do you think of our X2, true atomic iodine?
[01:57:55.065 --> 01:57:57.987]  I want to tell you something about iodine that people don't realize.
[01:57:58.347 --> 01:58:03.971]  50% of the American population, Canadian population as well, may be deficient in iodine.
[01:58:04.591 --> 01:58:05.812]  Iodine is a mineral.
[01:58:06.092 --> 01:58:08.534]  It's one of the elements in the periodic table.
[01:58:09.154 --> 01:58:15.039]  And you do not get this iodine from plants or from food because they produce it.
[01:58:15.379 --> 01:58:16.840]  They get it from the soil.
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.123]  And you, consuming the food, take the iodine.
[01:58:22.077 --> 01:58:26.239]  Iodine is essential to every cell development, especially in children.
[01:58:26.839 --> 01:58:36.443]  And iodine is concentrated in the gland where it filters the serum coming through your blood and extracts whatever iodine is present.
[01:58:36.623 --> 01:58:42.446]  If the iodine is not present in sufficient numbers, your thyroid gland has to work double time.
[01:58:42.546 --> 01:58:44.907]  In the extreme, it has to
[01:58:45.707 --> 01:58:46.668]  It reaches the limit.
[01:58:46.728 --> 01:58:56.858]  So then the pituitary gland sends thyroid growth hormone to it to make sure that it's bigger so it can process more serum and get more iodine from it.
[01:58:57.578 --> 01:59:00.861]  In the ultimate extreme, it's called goiter.
[01:59:01.322 --> 01:59:02.063]  It's a disease.
[01:59:02.723 --> 01:59:20.989]  And people don't realize that if you are short of iodine, if you're deficient, your cells will not mature properly, develop, and never mind radiation coming from Fukushima, but at the same time, iodine enables your cells to develop.
[01:59:21.249 --> 01:59:24.130]  And it's very important for muscular brain development.
[01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:29.852]  A lot of brain problems and breast cancer may be attributable to iodine deficiency.
[01:59:29.952 --> 01:59:45.239]  And by the way you can just search engine mainstream news admits iodine deficiency on average 15 IQ point reductions then fluoride added another 15 it's all admitted this is a plan where they bomb us with the bad halogen that our thyroid then uses and it basically then gives us the swollen thyroid.
[01:59:50.961 --> 01:59:56.884]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.318 --> 02:00:07.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:10.202]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.183 --> 02:00:14.325]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:00:14.865 --> 02:00:17.267]  Run on for a long time.
[02:00:17.807 --> 02:00:19.929]  Run on for a long time.
[02:00:20.889 --> 02:00:27.234]  Milo Yiannopoulos is here.
[02:00:27.314 --> 02:00:27.975]  Best-selling book.
[02:00:28.215 --> 02:00:30.717]  Dangerous, despite the fact that the publisher backed out of it.
[02:00:31.197 --> 02:00:33.739]  He's launching his own daily transmission.
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:40.565]  He's gone around the world and just had huge, huge overflow crowds, which shows their censorship is failing.
[02:00:40.585 --> 02:00:43.067]  But it's kind of like they shut us down here like a whack-a-mole.
[02:00:43.107 --> 02:00:44.148]  We pop up back there.
[02:00:44.648 --> 02:00:51.712]  But getting into Davos now, during the breaks you had some great analysis of Trump going to Davos and knocking it out of the park.
[02:00:51.752 --> 02:00:58.876]  I mean, and I'm not like you're sycophantically worshipping Trump, but it's true, compared to what Hillary would be doing right now, how could anybody not be really excited?
[02:00:59.356 --> 02:00:59.957]  Oh, it's wonderful.
[02:01:00.217 --> 02:01:06.680]  And you see like the camera phone footage and the guy looks like, he looks so much bigger than everybody else, just, you know, figuratively speaking.
[02:01:06.961 --> 02:01:08.902]  He's like a, he's like some kind of deity.
[02:01:09.002 --> 02:01:09.422]  Hard time.
[02:01:09.742 --> 02:01:18.428]  On all of these, you know, grey-suited, papery-skinned, boring-suited, blue-tied, you know, like, non-entities.
[02:01:18.468 --> 02:01:23.551]  These non-entities, these anodyne, you know, kind of left-wing... Trump really does have an aura, and it's intensifying.
[02:01:23.631 --> 02:01:24.031]  No, no, no.
[02:01:24.251 --> 02:01:28.494]  You, I mean, you and I have both been in the room with him many times, and... No, you many times, me only twice.
[02:01:28.714 --> 02:01:37.100]  Okay, well, me only probably three or four times, but he's, he, you know, he has a sense of gravity, you know, and he has like an aura, and I've only... Melania even more.
[02:01:37.981 --> 02:01:38.702]  Well, you would say so.
[02:01:38.882 --> 02:01:39.242]  No, okay.
[02:01:39.282 --> 02:01:39.722]  You would say so.
[02:01:39.742 --> 02:01:40.363]  Tell me about it, sorry.
[02:01:40.383 --> 02:01:47.808]  I'm a daddy, but... No, I've only noticed that two other people that I've been in the presence of, who have had it, were Margaret Thatcher and Mariah Carey.
[02:01:48.488 --> 02:01:56.074]  And all three of them I have, you know, sat across the table from, and all three of them had that thing where the world just slightly stops for a second when you're in their presence.
[02:01:56.374 --> 02:01:58.895]  And everything just seems like it's orbiting them, because it is.
[02:01:59.716 --> 02:02:01.958]  Our reporter was there, and there was video of it.
[02:02:01.978 --> 02:02:03.719]  They said every room he went in, everybody got silent.
[02:02:04.159 --> 02:02:06.839]  And suddenly all these enemies went, I like Trump, I like Trump!
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.440]  And you've got these, did you see that footage of that business roundtable?
[02:02:10.660 --> 02:02:16.521]  Where you've got all of these like, you know, square spectacle Danish business leaders and Norwegians.
[02:02:16.561 --> 02:02:18.501]  And they know the big alpha males in the room.
[02:02:18.521 --> 02:02:19.742]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:19.862 --> 02:02:22.402]  And you can see them all hunched, all their body language changes.
[02:02:22.422 --> 02:02:23.942]  They kind of go like this and they go like this.
[02:02:24.142 --> 02:02:30.503]  And you've got these Norwegians saying, oh, well, we always loved America and we are going to invest very heavily in America.
[02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:33.324]  And Trump's just sitting back as if to say, yeah, you are.
[02:02:35.243 --> 02:02:36.344]  He's so cool.
[02:02:37.305 --> 02:02:38.145]  He's just cool.
[02:02:38.285 --> 02:02:39.106]  And he's still cool.
[02:02:39.446 --> 02:02:43.689]  And he keeps pulling off stuff that no other Republican would be able to do.
[02:02:44.009 --> 02:02:46.491]  And he's got this slight smile on his face all the time.
[02:02:46.531 --> 02:02:47.171]  And I'll tell you what it is.
[02:02:47.231 --> 02:02:49.253]  It's because a lot of people know him really well behind the scenes.
[02:02:49.773 --> 02:02:50.594]  He really believes what he's doing.
[02:02:50.634 --> 02:02:53.636]  But also, he hates all the stuff, suits and all the fake people.
[02:02:54.296 --> 02:02:55.137]  He makes fun of himself.
[02:02:55.317 --> 02:02:56.458]  It's a big joke to him.
[02:02:56.598 --> 02:02:56.758]  Yeah.
[02:02:56.858 --> 02:03:04.503]  So he doesn't give a crap about all these fake people, he cares about real people and that's why they're like, why does it seem like so funny?
[02:03:04.583 --> 02:03:05.483]  Why does it seem he's so smug?
[02:03:05.503 --> 02:03:09.746]  Because he's knowing and he's like, he's an amazing performer.
[02:03:09.966 --> 02:03:13.588]  He is an amazing performer and he sits at the table and he's like, oh well you know I...
[02:03:14.108 --> 02:03:15.489]  I've always managed to get a lot of press.
[02:03:15.609 --> 02:03:17.311]  Maybe someday somebody will tell me why.
[02:03:17.371 --> 02:03:17.891]  I don't know why.
[02:03:18.251 --> 02:03:24.856]  He does this kind of like weird, faux-innocent, coquettish kind of routine where he's like, I don't know, people just seem to want to write stories about me.
[02:03:24.896 --> 02:03:26.037]  And it's hilarious!
[02:03:26.117 --> 02:03:26.757]  It's so funny.
[02:03:26.777 --> 02:03:28.579]  He does it knowingly, consciously.
[02:03:28.659 --> 02:03:29.880]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:32.221]  The whole room is laughing even though they don't really want to.
[02:03:32.542 --> 02:03:33.162]  The guy's great!
[02:03:33.182 --> 02:03:35.684]  And then when he says stuff like CNN, you are fake news.
[02:03:36.024 --> 02:03:39.387]  The way he does it, you couldn't have a thousand directors get it that good, the way he goes.
[02:03:40.787 --> 02:03:40.967]  Out!
[02:03:41.128 --> 02:03:46.932]  Or, you are fake news, it's just like... But it wasn't out, it was... Jim Acosta asked him this question, he just goes, out.
[02:03:47.493 --> 02:03:54.058]  It was the most perfect, beautiful, dismissive, contemptuous, but not angry... He wasn't... It was just like, out!
[02:03:54.098 --> 02:03:55.339]  Like, get that roach out of there!
[02:03:55.359 --> 02:03:56.640]  He didn't... Sweep that roach up!
[02:03:56.821 --> 02:03:58.842]  It was contemptuous without being bitchy.
[02:03:59.163 --> 02:04:02.525]  He didn't give him the slightest bit more attention than he absolutely needed to.
[02:04:02.545 --> 02:04:04.367]  He just went, out.
[02:04:04.547 --> 02:04:05.167]  It was beautiful.
[02:04:05.388 --> 02:04:05.568]  Beautiful.
[02:04:05.588 --> 02:04:06.268]  It's like, you're in my head.
[02:04:06.288 --> 02:04:08.770]  Well, I have to say, because he just did it perfectly, it was like, out.
[02:04:09.191 --> 02:04:09.271]  Out.
[02:04:10.484 --> 02:04:15.707]  So what are they going to do, the parasites, the globals that took the country over in the world, as they're displaced?
[02:04:15.727 --> 02:04:17.308]  Because Trump's riding the nationalist wave.
[02:04:17.328 --> 02:04:20.771]  What are they going to do?
[02:04:21.331 --> 02:04:24.213]  There's no beating him in ordinary political terms.
[02:04:24.253 --> 02:04:27.375]  There's no beating him, you know, with the usual tools of journalism.
[02:04:27.395 --> 02:04:29.916]  And there's no beating him with the usual tools of politics.
[02:04:29.956 --> 02:04:32.418]  He's going to Davos as a sort of conquering hero.
[02:04:32.458 --> 02:04:34.339]  He's arriving as Alexander the Great.
[02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:38.882]  And, you know, the barbarian hordes from elsewhere in the world are on their bellies.
[02:04:39.683 --> 02:04:41.424]  No, they just, they don't understand what they're looking at.
[02:04:41.464 --> 02:04:43.125]  They don't know how to fight this guy.
[02:04:43.165 --> 02:04:44.146]  They don't know what to do.
[02:04:44.206 --> 02:04:47.108]  He's just entering like a, like a different, like a deity.
[02:04:47.128 --> 02:04:58.777]  Like, you know in 300 when Xerxes comes out of the gold and he's got all these whatever and he stands like the height of a man and a half above everybody else and they're all just like... We'll be right back with Milo who's on fire by the way.
[02:05:01.687 --> 02:05:19.998]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:05:20.078 --> 02:05:25.502]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:05:26.382 --> 02:05:27.043]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:05:27.163 --> 02:05:30.325]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:05:30.965 --> 02:05:31.945]  And so much more.
[02:05:32.506 --> 02:05:33.646]  It is concentrated.
[02:05:33.866 --> 02:05:35.587]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:05:35.607 --> 02:05:41.289]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:05:41.389 --> 02:05:42.589]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:05:42.609 --> 02:05:44.550]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:05:44.630 --> 02:05:47.011]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:05:47.211 --> 02:05:48.492]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:05:48.652 --> 02:05:50.472]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:05:51.012 --> 02:05:51.613]  Immune Wall.
[02:05:51.733 --> 02:05:53.053]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:53.173 --> 02:05:54.334]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:16.389 --> 02:06:20.278]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:44.473]  And there's a lot of big world news, and I'm going to get to a lot of Milo and Ted Malik and others coming up, but the celebration of the defeat of the globalists all over the world, of nationalism, and of Trump and the American people and others now politically delivering, that really is a big, big deal.
[02:06:44.873 --> 02:06:46.114]  And so what is their only hope?
[02:06:46.134 --> 02:06:49.797]  You're saying they can't beat him conventionally, politically, so now they're pushing they want to kill him.
[02:06:50.097 --> 02:06:51.178]  Here's how they're going to do it again.
[02:06:52.078 --> 02:06:52.798]  If they're successful.
[02:06:53.178 --> 02:06:53.899]  Shannon Pohl.
[02:06:53.999 --> 02:06:57.560]  Trump trails Sanders, Biden, Oprah in 2020 match-ups.
[02:06:57.580 --> 02:07:01.861]  Well, I mean, Oprah, you see more tell than a toilet seat.
[02:07:02.321 --> 02:07:03.262]  Not that that's a bad thing.
[02:07:04.002 --> 02:07:06.142]  And delivers women to Harvey Weinstein, reportedly.
[02:07:06.482 --> 02:07:08.423]  And was a prostitute and all the rest of it.
[02:07:08.743 --> 02:07:09.583]  She's got an issue.
[02:07:09.603 --> 02:07:12.564]  So she already announced, and you want to get into that, that she's not running.
[02:07:12.704 --> 02:07:13.665]  We knew that was a stunt.
[02:07:13.865 --> 02:07:16.626]  But they want to make her a surrogate person, like women are against Trump.
[02:07:16.646 --> 02:07:17.686]  But here's how they'll do it.
[02:07:18.618 --> 02:07:20.239]  They put out fake polls.
[02:07:20.979 --> 02:07:22.659]  Now they used to show the methodology.
[02:07:22.719 --> 02:07:27.501]  Now I look and like 10, 20 page methodologies, they won't tell you the methodology, which tells you even more.
[02:07:27.741 --> 02:07:29.741]  How are all the polls wrong a year and a half ago?
[02:07:30.141 --> 02:07:32.262]  Okay, or a year and two months ago?
[02:07:32.622 --> 02:07:33.703]  Because they were fake.
[02:07:34.003 --> 02:07:37.204]  Because they sampled 9 to 30 plus points more Democrats.
[02:07:37.584 --> 02:07:40.324]  If they'll cheat on every other level, of course they're cheating.
[02:07:40.345 --> 02:07:41.805]  So the only thing they've got, Milo,
[02:07:42.426 --> 02:07:52.941]  Other than assassinating the president, trying to sabotage the economy, which they're not able to do right now, or keep saying, everybody hates him, everybody hates him, this hoax, will they be successful with fake polls?
[02:07:53.692 --> 02:07:58.256]  No, for the same reason they weren't successful with fake polls in the last election, because nobody believes them.
[02:07:58.296 --> 02:08:08.124]  I think polling is, to the extent that ordinary people think about it at all, people think of it as an extinction of the journalism that has been lying to them for decades.
[02:08:08.184 --> 02:08:18.293]  I mean, you know, polling will never recover as a concept, lest still an industry, just as an idea of something that is a valuable guide to what people are thinking, will never recover.
[02:08:18.353 --> 02:08:22.854]  Because it's always been twisted, but they went so far, they wrecked themselves.
[02:08:23.434 --> 02:08:25.935]  They overreached.
[02:08:25.975 --> 02:08:31.216]  They overreached out of arrogance and complacency because they didn't even contemplate the possibility of losing.
[02:08:31.256 --> 02:08:36.138]  So the headline is, Milo, the polling agencies killed themselves in 2016.
[02:08:39.196 --> 02:08:41.557]  They didn't even contemplate the possibility of losing.
[02:08:41.637 --> 02:08:45.499]  Just like these FBI guys who were sending each other messages.
[02:08:45.619 --> 02:08:47.120]  Clearly not even contemplating.
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:50.141]  Obama involved in all of this, according to reports on your site.
[02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:52.622]  Obama's involved in all of this, all the rest of it.
[02:08:52.642 --> 02:08:53.943]  They didn't even contemplate.
[02:08:53.963 --> 02:08:54.743]  They didn't plan.
[02:08:56.004 --> 02:09:00.685]  Well they say, there's no way he's going to win, but let's just manufacture a insurance policy.
[02:09:00.745 --> 02:09:04.686]  It's like the insurance you have in case you die at 40, you know, which of course nobody ever does.
[02:09:05.367 --> 02:09:13.509]  But the new thing is, they've got all the usual suspects going on TV going, it's a conspiracy theory that these text messages show collusion or bias.
[02:09:14.509 --> 02:09:16.490]  But then they won't even read the text messages on air!
[02:09:17.370 --> 02:09:20.851]  Oh no, this is a new thing in the media.
[02:09:20.891 --> 02:09:25.872]  You've got Newsweek cover stories about Breitbart without a single on-the-record named source.
[02:09:26.152 --> 02:09:29.313]  You've got unnamed sources in the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[02:09:29.613 --> 02:09:38.696]  There is no depth to which they will not... And here's how you know you're winning, and here's how you see the seeds of the destruction of polling, which you just asked me about, and journalism more generally.
[02:09:39.156 --> 02:09:42.578]  Because they have suspended their own standards and their own principles.
[02:09:42.638 --> 02:09:44.519]  So desperate are they to take down Donald Trump.
[02:09:44.799 --> 02:09:47.400]  The only thing journalism has is its integrity.
[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:50.022]  Because journalism is a business that rests on reputation.
[02:09:50.982 --> 02:09:56.865]  Journalism is only as good as the opinion that readers have of the masthead and of the journalists individually.
[02:09:57.165 --> 02:09:58.446]  Journalism doesn't work.
[02:09:58.846 --> 02:10:00.767]  Unless you trust the person who's telling you.
[02:10:01.107 --> 02:10:07.271]  So that's why the New York Times is always, you know, you know, that's why all the news is fit to print and they have a reader's editor holding themselves to account.
[02:10:07.371 --> 02:10:13.014]  All of this is designed to maintain an idea that the New York Times, you can believe what you read.
[02:10:13.074 --> 02:10:15.815]  Even though they're the standard of fraud, just like the Washington Post.
[02:10:16.095 --> 02:10:20.958]  Yeah, they have these billboards in Davos and they're also on the trains saying, New York Times, truth.
[02:10:21.758 --> 02:10:21.938]  Right.
[02:10:22.319 --> 02:10:27.845]  But, you know, the whole news rests on a foundation of trust and of trustworthiness.
[02:10:28.186 --> 02:10:30.728]  And without that, the entire business collapses.
[02:10:30.748 --> 02:10:31.469]  And that's what's happening.
[02:10:31.489 --> 02:10:34.893]  So let me ask you this question, Milo Yiannopoulos here in studio with us in Austin, Texas.
[02:10:35.614 --> 02:10:37.556]  Looking into your crystal balls, you really are a smart guy.
[02:10:38.377 --> 02:10:39.438]  Where does it all end?
[02:10:39.498 --> 02:10:40.318]  Where is it going?
[02:10:40.358 --> 02:10:44.701]  Because they're getting more and more radical, more and more crazy in their attempts to stop this recovery.
[02:10:44.742 --> 02:10:45.562]  It's so obvious.
[02:10:46.162 --> 02:10:48.004]  So they're doubling down on what already didn't work.
[02:10:48.084 --> 02:10:48.844]  Where does this go?
[02:10:48.884 --> 02:10:50.225]  Because they're getting so insane.
[02:10:50.646 --> 02:10:53.908]  Like you said, we're going to have to be in armored citadels now because they're so crazed.
[02:10:54.168 --> 02:10:55.209]  They're like zombies.
[02:10:55.949 --> 02:10:58.011]  You know, stalking the land like Frankenstein!
[02:10:58.051 --> 02:11:09.643]  The Walking Dead, except outside, you would imagine that it would be the, you know, the dirty, you know, hemp-covered libertarians and the gun-toting Republicans out there as the zombies.
[02:11:09.683 --> 02:11:12.185]  But no, the zombies are the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[02:11:12.265 --> 02:11:16.970]  It's us, in the castle, and we're not, all we're doing is begging to be left alone.
[02:11:17.911 --> 02:11:18.752]  But no, I mean,
[02:11:19.292 --> 02:11:38.359]  Your Citadel metaphor, well it was my Citadel metaphor, but our Citadel metaphor, I think you see I'm one of life's givers, is literal as well as metaphoric because the end point of this, I was talking to a friend of your show and a friend of mine recently who observed to me, and I'd never quite just heard it put this bluntly,
[02:11:39.119 --> 02:11:40.900]  It's obviously going to end in civil war.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.541]  Facebook's going to get firebombed.
[02:11:42.601 --> 02:11:43.861]  CNN people are going to get attacked.
[02:11:43.901 --> 02:11:47.943]  And we don't say that with any pleasure because we spend hours every day talking about the violence of the left.
[02:11:47.963 --> 02:11:48.864]  They're cutting us off!
[02:11:48.904 --> 02:11:51.705]  Kennedy said... We hate violence from the left.
[02:11:51.725 --> 02:11:53.706]  We hate violence as a response to political ideas.
[02:11:54.006 --> 02:11:57.528]  My whole career has been defined by violent protests against my ideas.
[02:11:57.568 --> 02:12:00.330]  We both spend hours a day criticizing the violence of the left.
[02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:02.911]  But there is only one inevitable consequence.
[02:12:03.291 --> 02:12:20.632]  When all of the organs and all of the architecture of civil society, everything, is designed to attack decency and beauty and truth and goodness and, you know, real news and reality, and that is that people are going to start to take up arms and that is that people are going to say,
[02:12:21.272 --> 02:12:22.634]  Facebook won't let me express myself.
[02:12:22.694 --> 02:12:24.195]  The New York Times won't stop lying to me.
[02:12:24.495 --> 02:12:29.801]  I turn a TV show on ABC and I just want to laugh and they're lecturing me about Betsy DeVos's bad looks and Donald Trump.
[02:12:30.241 --> 02:12:31.903]  Where do I go to let off steam?
[02:12:32.884 --> 02:12:40.111]  And I go on the street and they physically attack me with bike locks and hot coffee and say, die Nazi, when they're funded by a living Nazi collaborator.
[02:12:40.631 --> 02:12:42.792]  The left is creating the conditions for civil war.
[02:12:42.812 --> 02:12:44.692]  And the way you know that is they've already started it.
[02:12:45.232 --> 02:12:46.452]  Antifa's already on the streets.
[02:12:46.732 --> 02:12:48.153]  They're already beating up the right.
[02:12:48.193 --> 02:12:52.773]  They won't even let my reporters into events at the Capitol with guns.
[02:12:52.793 --> 02:12:54.034]  And the police go, we can't stop them.
[02:12:54.194 --> 02:12:58.374]  And there are guys with guns to my crew saying, are you scared?
[02:12:58.875 --> 02:12:59.915]  And my reporter's shaking.
[02:12:59.935 --> 02:13:00.635]  He goes, yeah, man.
[02:13:00.655 --> 02:13:02.135]  There's a bunch of guys with guns at me.
[02:13:02.435 --> 02:13:03.435]  And you're saying I'm scared.
[02:13:03.595 --> 02:13:05.536]  And they start hitting him with clubs.
[02:13:06.776 --> 02:13:07.697]  They've already started it.
[02:13:08.038 --> 02:13:09.459]  The left has already started it.
[02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:17.127]  I mean, the only thing that you can hope for is that, you know, this doesn't get as ugly as it could, and that there's a swift resolution.
[02:13:17.167 --> 02:13:20.270]  I mean, you know, you don't start a civil war with the side of the country that has all the guns.
[02:13:20.770 --> 02:13:22.352]  You know, I don't think they're going to like it when it comes.
[02:13:24.551 --> 02:13:36.053]  That's what the military is looking at right now, the Patriots, is it's so crazy and they're getting the communication, we've infiltrated the groups as well, they are planning a violent uprising.
[02:13:36.333 --> 02:13:37.673]  This is all just a beta test.
[02:13:38.173 --> 02:13:39.354]  They've already started it.
[02:13:39.374 --> 02:13:40.334]  They're doing the dummy test.
[02:13:40.354 --> 02:13:48.855]  No, I agree, but in the meetings they say they're probing us and getting us used to it so when they finally really attack and they plan to try to kill like a hundred cops apiece, that's not going to happen.
[02:13:48.875 --> 02:13:52.376]  I mean, what's going to happen when they actually kill 30, 40 cops in each city?
[02:13:52.396 --> 02:13:53.836]  The cops are going to slaughter them all.
[02:13:53.956 --> 02:13:55.157]  They're getting the media on side.
[02:13:55.578 --> 02:13:57.760]  They're getting CNN to do these laws.
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.202]  That was in the Soros documents from 2015.
[02:13:59.242 --> 02:14:07.270]  They wanted to cause a race war to trigger nationwide civil emergency to have Obama come in and federalize all local government and then take over.
[02:14:07.451 --> 02:14:07.631]  Right.
[02:14:07.871 --> 02:14:09.413]  And they've got CNN posting.
[02:14:09.453 --> 02:14:13.958]  I mean, this stuff sounds, you know, like the plot of an X-Files episode we were talking about earlier.
[02:14:13.978 --> 02:14:15.339]  But this stuff is happening.
[02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:18.522]  You've got CNN on side making excuses for Antifa.
[02:14:19.162 --> 02:14:24.747]  You've got Antifa supporting college professors publishing manifestos.
[02:14:24.827 --> 02:14:27.369]  One just came out two months ago called the Antifa Handbook, I think it was.
[02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:31.032]  These people are setting out the terms of their war.
[02:14:31.372 --> 02:14:32.753]  They are setting out their stalls.
[02:14:32.813 --> 02:14:33.574]  They are planning.
[02:14:33.634 --> 02:14:35.235]  They are distributing their manifestos.
[02:14:35.996 --> 02:14:44.725]  They're arming and they're testing us out with these little incursions on college campuses, incursions at public events, incursions at inaugurations.
[02:14:44.805 --> 02:14:49.990]  I mean this isn't speculation, this isn't conspiracy theory, this is what they're doing on American streets right now.
[02:14:50.210 --> 02:14:51.111]  They've already started.
[02:14:51.812 --> 02:14:52.953]  And they're doing it all over the world.
[02:14:53.413 --> 02:14:58.377]  And the media and the big tech companies are all working in unison and admitting they're doing it.
[02:14:58.957 --> 02:14:59.898]  It's insane.
[02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:04.702]  And can't Bezos and all these guys worth hundreds of billions of dollars just stop?
[02:15:05.242 --> 02:15:07.804]  They've somehow got to take over.
[02:15:07.944 --> 02:15:08.605]  Aren't you happy?
[02:15:08.945 --> 02:15:13.028]  You're the wealthiest guy or the third wealthiest guy in the world.
[02:15:13.048 --> 02:15:14.089]  You have everything you want.
[02:15:14.349 --> 02:15:15.770]  Can't you just leave the rest of us alone?
[02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:17.871]  Can't you just leave us be?
[02:15:17.911 --> 02:15:20.994]  Why is it that almost all the ultra-rich people are so-called leftists?
[02:15:21.952 --> 02:15:22.853]  I don't think that's true.
[02:15:22.973 --> 02:15:28.136]  I just think that the wealthy conservatives, by their nature, want to be left alone.
[02:15:28.236 --> 02:15:29.357]  They don't tend to be activists.
[02:15:29.397 --> 02:15:40.424]  I mean, if you think about the super donors on the Republican side, they're actually few and far between versus, you know, corporate America, the leftist donor class, you know, governments, the charitable sector, the rest of it.
[02:15:40.444 --> 02:15:50.771]  The amount of money on the right, I mean, okay, you've got establishment right, you've got the Koch brothers, you've got a few others, more libertarian, insurgent, Trumpian right, you've got Sheldon, you've got the Mercers, you've got a couple, you know, there are a few
[02:15:51.612 --> 02:15:58.182]  Mega donors, but the money is you know, like if you're if you're people a lot smaller the left has a pool is tiny compared to
[02:16:00.498 --> 02:16:02.900]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immunewald.
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:05.742]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[02:16:05.982 --> 02:16:08.203]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[02:16:08.744 --> 02:16:14.828]  And we set out with beta glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[02:16:14.848 --> 02:16:26.095]  We can even make claims about what this does to bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling or you're under stress or it's in the winter months.
[02:16:26.655 --> 02:16:28.917]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[02:16:28.977 --> 02:16:30.218]  Wellmune is patented.
[02:16:31.258 --> 02:16:33.920]  And documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[02:16:34.861 --> 02:16:36.922]  And then you got the ancient stuff there as well.
[02:16:36.962 --> 02:16:41.625]  The organic olive leaf extract is what the Roman soldiers would take whenever they started getting sick.
[02:16:42.045 --> 02:16:45.487]  Just chopped full of all those key enzymes and vitamin C and so much more.
[02:16:45.927 --> 02:16:51.991]  Then it's got all the concentrated highest quality organic types of mushrooms that are documented for your body.
[02:16:52.031 --> 02:16:57.314]  And then concentrated citrus peel, orange peel, lemon peel, organic orange peel.
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:02.062]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not going to sit here and hype this product up.
[02:17:03.163 --> 02:17:10.568]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing, melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:17:10.929 --> 02:17:15.252]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[02:17:15.852 --> 02:17:22.197]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:17:23.558 --> 02:17:45.829]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things, and I checked with scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records, and then you get a sleep unlike other systems.
[02:17:47.205 --> 02:17:47.925]  Randall Wilhite.
[02:17:48.266 --> 02:17:51.787]  His name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[02:17:51.807 --> 02:17:53.388]  He writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:17:53.408 --> 02:17:55.249]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:17:55.269 --> 02:17:57.149]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:17:57.710 --> 02:18:00.051]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[02:18:00.071 --> 02:18:02.852]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:18:03.372 --> 02:18:04.973]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:18:04.993 --> 02:18:06.994]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:18:08.211 --> 02:18:11.352]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:18:11.392 --> 02:18:12.253]  This is insane.
[02:18:12.693 --> 02:18:13.633]  Wow, it's incredible.
[02:18:13.673 --> 02:18:15.694]  I've taken melatonin up by itself and it didn't help.
[02:18:16.214 --> 02:18:17.075]  Wow, this is incredible.
[02:18:17.355 --> 02:18:18.435]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[02:18:18.475 --> 02:18:23.457]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and the wives tales together to make you sleep.
[02:18:23.537 --> 02:18:24.478]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[02:18:25.138 --> 02:18:26.280]  And they're all game changers.
[02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:31.147]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews or power reviews and others that we have linked.
[02:18:31.768 --> 02:18:35.392]  Our average review on InfoWareStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[02:18:39.898 --> 02:18:45.680]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them, going, we want to see it, it must be fake, blah, blah, blah.
[02:18:45.980 --> 02:18:47.500]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[02:18:48.781 --> 02:18:52.622]  So, they've had campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[02:18:52.662 --> 02:18:54.342]  I mean, they are just so angry.
[02:18:54.522 --> 02:19:02.445]  Where they test our stuff and test it and test it in California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[02:19:02.785 --> 02:19:08.812]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[02:19:09.113 --> 02:19:11.575]  What is it, 60-something of our products are all California standard.
[02:19:11.595 --> 02:19:17.002]  But if you've got something that's got, I don't know, 10, 15 ingredients in it, and it's also a large serving like Caveman?
[02:19:17.302 --> 02:19:19.905]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup.
[02:19:20.606 --> 02:19:23.428]  Has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[02:19:23.568 --> 02:19:24.288]  It's just insane.
[02:19:24.308 --> 02:19:27.870]  And then we tested, tested, test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[02:19:27.890 --> 02:19:30.312]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:30.832 --> 02:19:33.053]  But thank you for committing to get the great products.
[02:19:33.393 --> 02:19:34.954]  The books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:19:35.315 --> 02:19:37.936]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:19:37.956 --> 02:19:41.018]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films.
[02:19:41.638 --> 02:19:44.760]  And you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:47.902]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:19:48.242 --> 02:19:49.563]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:19:51.522 --> 02:19:53.044]  That's available at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:19:53.124 --> 02:19:54.825]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.554 --> 02:20:20.527]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:20.868 --> 02:20:23.174]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:28.294 --> 02:20:30.555]  Ladies and gentlemen, Milo is here with us.
[02:20:30.715 --> 02:20:31.596]  He needs no introduction.
[02:20:31.656 --> 02:20:33.997]  His best-selling book, Dangerous, Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:20:34.538 --> 02:20:36.739]  I'm Alex Jones of Infowars.com.
[02:20:37.359 --> 02:20:45.144]  And don't forget, we are financing a reporter, Dan Lyman, doing a great job with amazing video and text reports at Davos.
[02:20:45.824 --> 02:20:48.406]  We've got the big crews here, all the new shows we're launching.
[02:20:49.066 --> 02:20:50.907]  I'm looking at teaming up with Milo.
[02:20:50.927 --> 02:20:51.728]  We've been talking about
[02:20:52.048 --> 02:20:55.871]  Speaking tours, him hosting shows with us, so he's not just here to go on the show today.
[02:20:55.891 --> 02:20:59.934]  A lot of exciting things happening as we bring the renaissance back.
[02:20:59.994 --> 02:21:03.737]  Not liberal, not conservative, but true progress that is the West.
[02:21:04.097 --> 02:21:09.742]  But the globalists want to take over and create a technocracy and hijack the West, calling themselves progressives.
[02:21:09.802 --> 02:21:11.603]  They are total counterfeits.
[02:21:11.924 --> 02:21:13.285]  So please support the broadcast.
[02:21:13.365 --> 02:21:14.205]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:21:15.106 --> 02:21:15.667]  We're good to go.
[02:21:33.948 --> 02:21:43.156]  I set out to come out with the top developer in the country, top organic developer in the country, the highest quality, 400 plus milligram, pure, I mean this is 95%, the average is 3%, okay?
[02:21:43.277 --> 02:21:45.178]  So this is 95% the chemical that is in the turmeric.
[02:21:52.165 --> 02:21:53.046]  The Curcuminoids.
[02:21:53.527 --> 02:21:54.328]  It's unbelievable.
[02:21:54.348 --> 02:21:55.349]  60-day supply.
[02:21:55.369 --> 02:21:56.791]  50% off.
[02:21:57.212 --> 02:21:57.813]  Out of the gates.
[02:21:58.314 --> 02:22:00.416]  But it's been so successful, we got a limited run.
[02:22:00.436 --> 02:22:02.059]  It may be months until it comes back in.
[02:22:02.099 --> 02:22:03.941]  It'll be sold out in a week at the rate of sale.
[02:22:04.162 --> 02:22:07.166]  People wanted a high-quality turmeric product.
[02:22:07.606 --> 02:22:08.327]  You've got it!
[02:22:08.948 --> 02:22:17.274]  But folks are so blown away by the write-up on it that it is flying off the shelves, which is good, but at this price, we've got to sell a lot of it to fund the operation.
[02:22:17.614 --> 02:22:18.755]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:22:18.795 --> 02:22:22.178]  Sign up for AutoShip, and we never sell out because we hold back bottles for you.
[02:22:22.198 --> 02:22:26.081]  It's all automated at our shipping center in Central Texas a few miles away.
[02:22:27.279 --> 02:22:32.525]  And then that will be shipped out to you at 10% off on the sale price.
[02:22:32.545 --> 02:22:33.165]  You already got it.
[02:22:33.606 --> 02:22:37.210]  We have another great new product that deals with the pollen.
[02:22:37.510 --> 02:22:38.271]  It's a pollen block.
[02:22:38.571 --> 02:22:43.056]  Find out about its proprietary system and why it's chemical free and how amazing it is at m4store.com.
[02:22:43.096 --> 02:22:47.120]  And we've got it in this over the weekend because it's a limited sale.
[02:22:48.401 --> 02:22:53.005]  We have the Alexa Pure Breeze four-stage filter including ION.
[02:22:53.325 --> 02:22:55.166]  Leading competitors when this first came out were like $1,000.
[02:22:55.206 --> 02:22:57.988]  Now they've miniaturized and stuff like this has driven down the price.
[02:22:58.268 --> 02:22:59.729]  We were selling at $300 and $250.
[02:23:00.430 --> 02:23:02.211]  Now it's $200 normally.
[02:23:02.631 --> 02:23:06.234]  Leading competitors are $400 to $500 now for something that's exactly the same.
[02:23:06.894 --> 02:23:09.216]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's $50 off right now.
[02:23:09.316 --> 02:23:12.438]  It's $149 right now.
[02:23:12.798 --> 02:23:15.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, you're trying my pollen block there.
[02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:16.401]  I am not.
[02:23:16.801 --> 02:23:17.621]  It's quail eggs.
[02:23:17.821 --> 02:23:19.643]  Japanese quail finished special diet.
[02:23:19.963 --> 02:23:21.183]  The French discovered it's patented.
[02:23:21.204 --> 02:23:23.545]  No, I woke up with a bit of a sniffly nose today because it's different.
[02:23:23.585 --> 02:23:23.765]  Cedar.
[02:23:23.785 --> 02:23:23.945]  Horrible.
[02:23:23.965 --> 02:23:25.306]  When you go to different states, it's different.
[02:23:25.326 --> 02:23:25.926]  No, we're the worst.
[02:23:26.467 --> 02:23:27.888]  Austin's the worst allergies in the country.
[02:23:28.188 --> 02:23:33.311]  I love Texas, but down the road, if we make enough money, I'm going to move this operation to a desert somewhere.
[02:23:33.371 --> 02:23:34.432]  No, I noticed that.
[02:23:34.512 --> 02:23:34.772]  I noticed.
[02:23:34.792 --> 02:23:35.853]  Because I woke up this morning, I was a bit...
[02:23:37.394 --> 02:23:37.654]  Nope.
[02:23:37.674 --> 02:23:39.575]  This knocks it out 80-90% within an hour.
[02:23:39.756 --> 02:23:40.896]  Alright, that's mine.
[02:23:41.357 --> 02:23:41.737]  It's yours.
[02:23:41.777 --> 02:23:42.218]  That's with me.
[02:23:42.618 --> 02:23:44.119]  Alright, riding shotgun with us.
[02:23:44.239 --> 02:23:49.764]  Joining us for the next two and a half segments or so is Ted Malek, known as the Davos Man.
[02:23:49.784 --> 02:23:55.568]  He announced seven years ago that Davos is dead and chartered that a great new Americanism would be coming.
[02:23:56.029 --> 02:23:58.791]  And so we're going to be talking to him as soon as his Skype's ready.
[02:23:58.811 --> 02:23:59.552]  I'm told it just dropped.
[02:23:59.752 --> 02:24:02.434]  You know, Skype's amazing with these shows, but right when you're going to them, it drops.
[02:24:02.634 --> 02:24:03.355]  No, I hate it.
[02:24:03.395 --> 02:24:04.375]  Wait, he's good.
[02:24:04.395 --> 02:24:04.796]  He's back.
[02:24:04.856 --> 02:24:05.296]  He's here.
[02:24:05.476 --> 02:24:06.477]  Okay, boom.
[02:24:06.997 --> 02:24:11.040]  Ted Malik, meet Milo Yiannopoulos, or maybe you've met him before.
[02:24:11.401 --> 02:24:11.881]  No, we haven't.
[02:24:11.901 --> 02:24:12.541]  Hi, how are you?
[02:24:13.162 --> 02:24:15.203]  Hey, well I wish you could see me.
[02:24:15.263 --> 02:24:16.044]  I've heard you speak.
[02:24:16.084 --> 02:24:16.284]  Good.
[02:24:17.005 --> 02:24:17.585]  Oh, splendid.
[02:24:17.605 --> 02:24:18.406]  Well, here we are.
[02:24:18.426 --> 02:24:20.087]  Wow, what do you make of what Trump did?
[02:24:20.147 --> 02:24:21.428]  It's exactly what you predicted.
[02:24:21.508 --> 02:24:24.931]  Selling America, promoting Americana, America's back.
[02:24:25.571 --> 02:24:26.592]  What do you make of this, Ted Malik?
[02:24:27.341 --> 02:24:32.328]  Well, I mean, of course, I watched the whole thing and took copious notes.
[02:24:32.488 --> 02:24:33.609]  I was cheering.
[02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:35.812]  But he was fantastic.
[02:24:35.872 --> 02:24:40.438]  I mean, the CEOs in the room at Davos were gaga.
[02:24:40.478 --> 02:24:41.299]  That's the only word.
[02:24:41.980 --> 02:24:45.585]  It was the 48th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
[02:24:46.278 --> 02:24:49.159]  In fact, they've never seen anything like this before.
[02:24:49.219 --> 02:24:55.602]  There was, in effect, a kind of Trump-o-mania, an outright giddiness about his being there.
[02:24:55.622 --> 02:24:55.662]  U.S.
[02:24:56.142 --> 02:24:57.823]  troops... They're like schoolgirls, aren't they?
[02:24:58.806 --> 02:24:59.707]  Yeah, I mean U.S.
[02:24:59.747 --> 02:25:04.270]  growth is... It's like he's Elvis in 1957 and the schoolgirls are throwing their panties out.
[02:25:04.290 --> 02:25:08.432]  Look at the Beatles, you know, you've got the Danish finance minister going, woohoo!
[02:25:08.452 --> 02:25:09.853]  Jed Mallet, let me ask this question.
[02:25:09.873 --> 02:25:11.635]  We had a reporter there, we got video of it.
[02:25:11.975 --> 02:25:15.957]  He said it himself that even liberal media admits he takes it by storm.
[02:25:16.178 --> 02:25:17.078]  They're captivated.
[02:25:17.638 --> 02:25:18.919]  The rooms are all quiet.
[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.340]  Trumpmania!
[02:25:20.761 --> 02:25:24.443]  I guess they built him up as Hitler and then all he brings is prosperity.
[02:25:24.463 --> 02:25:25.744]  I mean, what are they thinking?
[02:25:26.545 --> 02:25:30.548]  And everybody in that room is basically cashing in.
[02:25:30.568 --> 02:25:38.936]  There's been $7 trillion of new wealth created in America, particularly in the stock market, since he's been president.
[02:25:39.356 --> 02:25:45.022]  What we are witnessing is nothing less than the accommodation of the world to Donald Trump.
[02:25:46.076 --> 02:25:48.318]  And again, we're not hyping this just to hype it.
[02:25:48.378 --> 02:25:49.299]  Ted, you're right.
[02:25:49.399 --> 02:25:51.841]  I look at the evidence and I go, I gotta come in here and gush?
[02:25:52.321 --> 02:25:56.164]  I gotta say he's exponentially broadcasting this invincibility aura?
[02:25:56.525 --> 02:25:57.806]  What is going on here, Ted Malik?
[02:25:59.047 --> 02:26:02.990]  Well, if you read his speech, and you can read the text, it's not very long.
[02:26:03.390 --> 02:26:05.732]  He's talking about free and fair trade.
[02:26:06.113 --> 02:26:10.716]  He mentions the word reciprocity over and over again, which is absolutely critical.
[02:26:11.257 --> 02:26:13.258]  You know, you do to us what
[02:26:14.255 --> 02:26:15.296]  You know what we do to you.
[02:26:15.396 --> 02:26:16.296]  It's very fair.
[02:26:16.897 --> 02:26:20.159]  And he's there representing the interests of the real American people.
[02:26:20.199 --> 02:26:22.220]  The American dream is back.
[02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:25.643]  After all these years of stagnation, we are back.
[02:26:25.963 --> 02:26:27.464]  He said he had a single message.
[02:26:27.524 --> 02:26:32.107]  The message was, build, hire, and invest in the United States.
[02:26:32.627 --> 02:26:39.532]  When you were reading it, the message on that, you know, kind of bottom header at the CNN site, it said, U.S.
[02:26:39.772 --> 02:26:41.253]  is open for business.
[02:26:43.004 --> 02:26:44.725]  And that's exactly what I said on Monday.
[02:26:44.765 --> 02:26:49.027]  He's going there to say, we're back, and we're back in business, because he's been saying he would say that.
[02:26:49.647 --> 02:26:53.048]  And then they go, oh, he's going over there to sell out, blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:53.128 --> 02:26:53.308]  No.
[02:26:53.629 --> 02:26:55.649]  And now he says, listen, we'll renegotiate TPP.
[02:26:55.890 --> 02:26:57.830]  He said that during the campaign, Ted.
[02:26:58.070 --> 02:27:01.372]  No, but he said, we'll renegotiate it on a bilateral basis.
[02:27:01.412 --> 02:27:03.673]  So it's not what the multilateralists want.
[02:27:04.133 --> 02:27:05.594]  He gave the example even of Apple.
[02:27:06.958 --> 02:27:15.063]  Investing 350 million, no, excuse me, 350 billion dollars, new dollars in United States plants.
[02:27:15.143 --> 02:27:16.343]  And he said that during the campaign.
[02:27:16.363 --> 02:27:19.125]  He said, Apple's coming back, gonna be huge.
[02:27:20.726 --> 02:27:22.607]  He's a nice color as well at the moment.
[02:27:22.647 --> 02:27:24.248]  I mean, I'm a great connoisseur.
[02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:25.168]  A little less orange?
[02:27:25.408 --> 02:27:29.851]  Well, I'm a connoisseur of Trump's differing fashion choices.
[02:27:29.911 --> 02:27:33.993]  Milo, we don't need to hear how you got the hots for Trump.
[02:27:34.053 --> 02:27:34.493]  You already know that.
[02:27:34.613 --> 02:27:38.676]  No, you can hear a little bit of it.
[02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.657]  Look, he's the leader of the free world.
[02:27:40.717 --> 02:27:43.599]  I think we can cope with one commentator who takes his look.
[02:27:43.859 --> 02:27:46.261]  Look, look, he's a very nice color at the moment.
[02:27:46.281 --> 02:27:50.383]  He's less orange, more, he looks more, you know, this is the fresh... More Santa Claus-ish.
[02:27:50.743 --> 02:27:52.624]  Like he's got a little bit of white, little rosy cheeks.
[02:27:52.644 --> 02:27:58.048]  A little, and the blonde is much more natural at the moment, you know, and he's looking, he's looking great.
[02:27:58.228 --> 02:27:59.229]  He's looking really, really nice.
[02:27:59.269 --> 02:28:00.709]  He looked like a cheerleader.
[02:28:01.890 --> 02:28:03.131]  He was a cheerleader.
[02:28:05.077 --> 02:28:05.978]  I think he looks wonderful.
[02:28:05.998 --> 02:28:07.641]  He's got a lot of cheerleader outfit.
[02:28:07.681 --> 02:28:11.087]  Some kiss, but well, I think that we could spare everyone the thought.
[02:28:11.107 --> 02:28:12.970]  That could be the headline.
[02:28:18.024 --> 02:28:18.964]  Look at it, look at it.
[02:28:19.045 --> 02:28:24.367]  I could just project this on my bedroom wall forever and be perfectly happy for the next 50 years.
[02:28:24.567 --> 02:28:25.668]  Milo, you're awesome.
[02:28:26.288 --> 02:28:27.348]  Ted, you're awesome too.
[02:28:27.448 --> 02:28:29.229]  Come back and give us the hard analysis.
[02:28:29.569 --> 02:28:31.330]  Then we have inside sources at Amos as well.
[02:28:32.431 --> 02:28:33.831]  Because I did see the headline day one.
[02:28:34.032 --> 02:28:35.852]  We love Trump, he's made us all richer.
[02:28:36.233 --> 02:28:39.354]  But some globalists are angry money's going to the little guys as well.
[02:28:39.814 --> 02:28:42.656]  So why is Lloyd Blankfein still behind the scenes against Trump?
[02:28:43.576 --> 02:28:46.297]  That's the most money Lloyd Blankfein's ever made.
[02:28:47.138 --> 02:28:52.420]  So we'll be back with Ted Malik, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Alex Jones.

[02:30:04.176 --> 02:30:07.500]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:08.342 --> 02:30:14.590]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:16.372 --> 02:30:22.715]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:30:23.516 --> 02:30:28.758]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:30:29.379 --> 02:30:39.764]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia,
[02:30:39.804 --> 02:30:40.544]  We're good.
[02:30:58.112 --> 02:30:59.494]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:30:59.754 --> 02:31:01.076]  You can't survive without it.
[02:31:01.236 --> 02:31:02.157]  But where do you get it?
[02:31:02.458 --> 02:31:08.225]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[02:31:08.445 --> 02:31:14.172]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:31:14.352 --> 02:31:31.199]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:31:58.337 --> 02:32:03.200]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWars Life.
[02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:07.943]  After years of research on the human microbiome, not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:32:08.263 --> 02:32:16.608]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[02:32:16.948 --> 02:32:20.190]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics
[02:32:20.450 --> 02:32:25.393]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:32:25.693 --> 02:32:32.676]  Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:32:32.997 --> 02:32:36.618]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut?
[02:32:36.919 --> 02:32:37.439]  That's why.
[02:32:37.739 --> 02:32:41.281]  Increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[02:32:41.622 --> 02:32:49.407]  Floralife is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[02:32:49.727 --> 02:32:53.629]  Head to infowarslife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today.

[02:33:02.075 --> 02:33:04.697]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.153 --> 02:33:35.844]  Yeah, they don't like Milo Yiannopoulos because he has a lot of fun and is popular and says a lot of interesting, smart things.
[02:33:35.864 --> 02:33:36.404]  They don't like...
[02:33:43.690 --> 02:33:52.972]  Ted Malik, because he's a smart guy as well, and been one of the first guys to really launch Davos, and been a board member and the rest of it, and he doesn't go along with their elitist policies.
[02:33:53.532 --> 02:34:00.194]  And so he's really, we're gushing about Trump, but this is a lot better than Hillary Clinton and what they already had planned.
[02:34:00.214 --> 02:34:02.535]  But Ted, what are you getting from your inside sources?
[02:34:02.995 --> 02:34:07.356]  And as you said, they're publicly embracing Trump suddenly, as they're all Hitler lovers now.
[02:34:08.096 --> 02:34:12.638]  Uh, and so, so, I mean, this just seems like another devastating victory for nationalism.
[02:34:12.998 --> 02:34:25.704]  Juncker, the unelected head of the EU, who's the main heir to the Nazi fortune and basically owns Luxembourg by fief, uh, you know, by a chum contract that his grandfather took it over for Hitler.
[02:34:26.164 --> 02:34:31.007]  He didn't show up, but Soros crawled out of the muck to say that Trump's going to end the world.
[02:34:31.287 --> 02:34:32.547]  Trump's going to be out before 2020.
[02:34:34.209 --> 02:34:35.852]  And a lot of really threatening things.
[02:34:35.872 --> 02:34:39.380]  Do we have any intel if these two snakes got in the same room with each other?
[02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:40.282]  I mean, not two snakes.
[02:34:40.522 --> 02:34:43.328]  This Patriot snake don't tread on me and the little globalist snake.
[02:34:44.739 --> 02:34:46.940]  No, all those people were there in the room.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.081]  The room was overflowing.
[02:34:48.101 --> 02:34:51.843]  They said there were over 3,000 seats, standing room only.
[02:34:52.483 --> 02:34:55.504]  The lines going into the room were triple wide.
[02:34:55.544 --> 02:34:56.285]  You couldn't get in.
[02:34:56.345 --> 02:34:57.765]  Everyone wanted to hear Trump.
[02:34:57.805 --> 02:35:03.408]  Now, he disappointed some people, I think some of us, by not giving him the middle finger.
[02:35:03.988 --> 02:35:05.549]  But he was very diplomatic.
[02:35:05.649 --> 02:35:06.870]  He was very straight on.
[02:35:07.566 --> 02:35:08.948]  He stayed on script.
[02:35:10.050 --> 02:35:11.492]  I think it was a brilliant speech.
[02:35:11.893 --> 02:35:14.417]  He did hit on North Korea, Iran and ISIS.
[02:35:14.477 --> 02:35:17.983]  He urged burden sharing in front of the Europeans who are not paying.
[02:35:18.536 --> 02:35:25.179]  And he said, I mean, if you want a theoretical point, he said, a nation's greatness is the sum of its people.
[02:35:25.679 --> 02:35:28.020]  We are stronger in sovereign nations.
[02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:33.543]  So he went to Davos and he gave them the message on American sovereignty.
[02:35:33.763 --> 02:35:35.924]  He actually called the people in the room.
[02:35:36.444 --> 02:35:37.145]  He called them out.
[02:35:37.185 --> 02:35:39.646]  He said, use your power for your people.
[02:35:40.655 --> 02:35:42.136]  And again, we're going to play that.
[02:35:42.156 --> 02:35:43.997]  I should have gotten to that.
[02:36:00.731 --> 02:36:02.572]  Where he knocked fake news.
[02:36:03.133 --> 02:36:08.056]  And then in the second question, he defended how his mind works, what's driving him.
[02:36:08.277 --> 02:36:10.098]  He said it's love of country.
[02:36:10.418 --> 02:36:12.740]  Well, too bad Davosians.
[02:36:13.741 --> 02:36:14.221]  No, you're right.
[02:36:14.241 --> 02:36:21.086]  This was a very epic speech where he explained culture, nationalism, that's what really matters, not some big globalist takeover.
[02:36:21.106 --> 02:36:24.548]  And before they take that Freudian slip and twist it, it was a Freudian slip.
[02:36:24.568 --> 02:36:25.849]  Talking about two snakes here.
[02:36:26.850 --> 02:36:43.519]  One didn't show up, that's of course the former head of the Central EU Committee and now the head of the overall EU, that being Juncker, and then Soros, the Nazi collaborator as well, he did show up.
[02:36:43.579 --> 02:36:53.164]  So these two snakes, one showed up, one didn't, but I guess we don't have any photos or video to know if Soros even dared go into the same room with Trump.
[02:36:54.966 --> 02:36:56.547]  Well, I don't know if he was in the room.
[02:36:56.587 --> 02:37:01.709]  He certainly made statements before his speaking, you know, about Trump being a danger to the world.
[02:37:01.729 --> 02:37:06.472]  Al Gore was there, who was knocking Trump for not going along with the Paris Accord.
[02:37:06.512 --> 02:37:12.054]  So there are all kinds of people sniping at Trump as he arrived in that big helicopter in the snow.
[02:37:12.795 --> 02:37:18.818]  But I actually, when I finished, you know, viewing the whole saga, I said,
[02:37:19.446 --> 02:37:21.386]  This is not the World Economic Forum.
[02:37:21.706 --> 02:37:22.647]  This is the U.S.
[02:37:22.727 --> 02:37:23.607]  Economic Forum.
[02:37:24.007 --> 02:37:28.188]  And what Trump is basically telling these people is, you can learn from us.
[02:37:28.368 --> 02:37:29.188]  Do what I did.
[02:37:30.248 --> 02:37:32.788]  Well, that's the name of the last two segments with you.
[02:37:32.808 --> 02:37:34.049]  We put it on YouTube and Facebook.
[02:37:35.449 --> 02:37:39.550]  Trump has turned the Davos World Economic Forum into the U.S.
[02:37:39.570 --> 02:37:40.290]  Economic Forum.
[02:37:40.430 --> 02:37:42.990]  Or, Davos is now the U.S.
[02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:47.171]  Economic Forum and is like an economic development bazaar.
[02:37:48.321 --> 02:37:50.123]  Or for short, y'all are my bitches now.
[02:37:54.606 --> 02:37:55.887]  What's crazy is the U.S.
[02:37:55.927 --> 02:38:00.751]  got hijacked and helped finance globalism, so isn't it perfect that America didn't roll it up?
[02:38:01.211 --> 02:38:04.234]  Oh no, look, what the Lord giveth, the Lord can take away.
[02:38:04.894 --> 02:38:11.640]  And Trump is taking it away, because it's now time for him to take special care of American citizens before he takes care of other people.
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:12.660]  Just last year,
[02:38:13.701 --> 02:38:21.825]  Ted Malik, the communist Chinese dictator, president, traveled there and said, don't worry, I'll block Trump, I'll stop nationalism, I'll stop populism.
[02:38:22.185 --> 02:38:23.666]  He said that again about a week ago.
[02:38:24.106 --> 02:38:24.726]  Is he there?
[02:38:24.786 --> 02:38:26.087]  We haven't heard anything from him.
[02:38:27.107 --> 02:38:28.008]  No, he's not there.
[02:38:28.068 --> 02:38:31.109]  There are people from his government there, but he's not there.
[02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:34.391]  And there's certainly all these European socialists are there.
[02:38:35.217 --> 02:38:47.064]  I mean, the audience is a mix of finance leaders, heads of state, prime ministers, but it's mostly business people who are benefiting from a strong America.
[02:38:47.124 --> 02:38:52.527]  The whole world benefits when America is roaring back, and believe me, it is roaring back.
[02:38:53.604 --> 02:38:54.384]  And you're right.
[02:38:54.404 --> 02:38:56.306]  We only aired like five minutes of the speech today.
[02:38:56.346 --> 02:38:58.046]  We should have aired the entire thing over and over again.
[02:38:58.087 --> 02:38:58.947]  It's only 60 minutes long.
[02:38:58.967 --> 02:39:00.148]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:39:00.648 --> 02:39:01.128]  Get it out.
[02:39:01.208 --> 02:39:04.970]  You see Trump's love of country, love of prosperity, and love of delivering.
[02:39:04.990 --> 02:39:07.232]  You know, we've had lies, lies, lies, and betrayal.
[02:39:07.512 --> 02:39:13.495]  We are now seeing somebody deliver, and I think we really should be gushing about it, because the enemies of this country are so upset.
[02:39:13.535 --> 02:39:16.597]  But every passing day, the clock ticks down.
[02:39:16.817 --> 02:39:20.259]  Here's some of the president talking about what Dr. Malik just discussed.
[02:39:21.039 --> 02:39:27.322]  America is roaring back, and now is the time to invest in the future of America.
[02:39:28.303 --> 02:39:32.205]  We have dramatically cut taxes to make America competitive.
[02:39:32.905 --> 02:39:36.867]  We are eliminating burdensome regulations at a record pace.
[02:39:37.587 --> 02:39:48.533]  We are reforming the bureaucracy to make it lean, responsive, and accountable, and we are ensuring our laws are enforced fairly.
[02:39:49.473 --> 02:39:50.893]  We have the best colleges.
[02:39:51.274 --> 02:39:52.074]  That's all code.
[02:39:52.114 --> 02:39:56.075]  Hey, your bureaucratic system of control to ship all our jobs out and to screw over U.S.
[02:39:56.115 --> 02:39:56.515]  companies?
[02:39:56.795 --> 02:39:57.715]  It's all going to be fair.
[02:39:58.075 --> 02:39:58.996]  It's all going to be by the book.
[02:39:59.256 --> 02:40:01.576]  And that's why companies are like, well, thank God we're moving back.
[02:40:01.616 --> 02:40:05.917]  Ted, I mean, like you said, every 30 seconds of this speech is just epic.
[02:40:05.977 --> 02:40:09.198]  And you know, because I've talked to folks that saw it, Trump wrote this speech.
[02:40:10.899 --> 02:40:16.540]  Well, I'm sure he had a hand in it because it's stuff he's said before and it has his twist.
[02:40:17.707 --> 02:40:25.309]  I'm sure a lot of people gave him sentences, but it's his speech, and he basically told the world that they have to play by the rules.
[02:40:25.469 --> 02:40:35.172]  No more subsidies, no more state planning, no more intellectual property theft, and I mean, this was just cheerleading for America.
[02:40:35.212 --> 02:40:36.952]  I mean, you had to be proud.
[02:40:37.433 --> 02:40:41.714]  He didn't do a lot of chess beating, but he did a lot of cheering.
[02:40:42.694 --> 02:40:43.094]  Exactly.
[02:40:43.134 --> 02:40:44.295]  He made it all about the American people.
[02:40:44.315 --> 02:40:45.615]  You know, I thought
[02:40:46.553 --> 02:40:49.477]  And by the way, we have given the awards out for the People's Choice Fake News Awards.
[02:40:49.517 --> 02:40:51.440]  I just never announced them yesterday, but they've been paid.
[02:40:51.480 --> 02:40:51.881]  It's happened.
[02:40:51.901 --> 02:40:53.924]  So maybe later today, I'll actually read those on air.
[02:40:54.825 --> 02:40:56.367]  But I thought, oh, it'll be Russiagate.
[02:40:56.648 --> 02:40:57.208]  It'll be this and that.
[02:40:57.268 --> 02:41:01.535]  No, he made it about the American people and the New York Times saying we never go to 3% growth rate.
[02:41:01.855 --> 02:41:02.776]  He made it about, look,
[02:41:03.297 --> 02:41:13.585]  This is about you, and it said in his award, the American people took action, they believed, they invested, you know, they started new businesses, and they turned the economy around.
[02:41:13.886 --> 02:41:18.770]  He made the number one fake news story, what was really the most important, and I should have thought of that, Milo.
[02:41:20.131 --> 02:41:21.272]  Yes, perhaps you should.
[02:41:21.972 --> 02:41:22.373]  But you didn't.
[02:41:23.663 --> 02:41:27.467]  But Trump did!
[02:41:27.888 --> 02:41:40.983]  He has this amazing gift, and I think that you share this gift with him, and some of our friends do too, of just cutting through the nonsense and the word salads and just saying,
[02:41:41.483 --> 02:41:42.324]  Here's the state of affairs.
[02:41:42.344 --> 02:41:43.786]  Here's what's going to happen for the next 18 months.
[02:41:43.987 --> 02:41:44.567]  Here's how it is.
[02:41:44.908 --> 02:41:51.256]  It's a very direct, plain-speaking manner that he has that is horrifying to the Davos elites because they don't speak.
[02:41:51.356 --> 02:41:52.097]  They're a bunch of snakes!
[02:41:52.438 --> 02:41:53.820]  Well, they are, but they also have this...
[02:41:55.812 --> 02:42:01.315]  It's a highly complex, nuanced, almost secret code language.
[02:42:01.355 --> 02:42:05.677]  They've created very complex nomenclatures, like guilds always do.
[02:42:05.697 --> 02:42:07.038]  That's the exact word I was reaching for.
[02:42:07.138 --> 02:42:07.758]  To keep people out.
[02:42:08.079 --> 02:42:08.339]  Right.
[02:42:08.519 --> 02:42:14.362]  And it's designed to enable them to give a 45 minute speech without actually saying very much.
[02:42:14.402 --> 02:42:16.663]  Trump, on the other hand, can give a 15 minute speech and say a lot.
[02:42:17.203 --> 02:42:17.444]  Wow.
[02:42:17.904 --> 02:42:24.111]  And, you know, chart out the course of the globe for the next 18 months in a quarter of an hour.
[02:42:24.131 --> 02:42:25.512]  Ted Malik, thank you for the time.
[02:42:25.572 --> 02:42:28.815]  Let's get you back on next week to really give us a recap of what happened.
[02:42:28.835 --> 02:42:32.139]  I want to spend a whole hour next week, maybe even Sunday, just playing the speech.
[02:42:32.179 --> 02:42:33.540]  This Sunday I'll be back 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:42:33.560 --> 02:42:33.861]  Central.
[02:42:34.141 --> 02:42:35.042]  Thank you so much, Ted Malik.
[02:42:36.001 --> 02:42:36.221]  Good.

[02:42:37.621 --> 02:42:38.882]  And we got Milo right here.

[02:42:42.663 --> 02:42:50.964]  Be sure and get that and be sure and understand, without you buying the products, the great supplements, the t-shirts, the books, you name it, InfoWarsTore.com, we are not here.
[02:42:51.024 --> 02:42:52.045]  But look at all the reviews.

[02:43:59.670 --> 02:44:04.492]  I remember reading about Ted Mallet 25 years ago, studying key people in globalist organizations.
[02:44:04.893 --> 02:44:06.293]  That doesn't mean everybody in them is bad.
[02:44:06.754 --> 02:44:10.696]  But about a decade ago, I started seeing him really critical of it, saying the EU is going to fall apart.
[02:44:11.056 --> 02:44:11.956]  It's going to go down.
[02:44:12.296 --> 02:44:13.277]  It's authoritarian.
[02:44:13.717 --> 02:44:16.498]  And he got involved in all this to promote freedom worldwide.
[02:44:16.599 --> 02:44:19.040]  So you're inside the situation from the beginning.
[02:44:19.500 --> 02:44:22.321]  They knew you were pro-America, pro-free market.
[02:44:22.782 --> 02:44:25.203]  And I guess they kind of sold globalism early on as
[02:44:25.723 --> 02:44:32.807]  Kind of Americana worldwide, but at what point did you really start to criticize it, and why did they leave you right in the middle of it, if you were so critical of it?
[02:44:32.827 --> 02:44:34.968]  Well, I think this is a gradual process.
[02:44:35.028 --> 02:44:42.793]  You know, in the 1992-95 period, globalization and Americanization were somewhat synonymous, as you suggest.
[02:44:43.433 --> 02:44:47.435]  And it became more and more apparent that these globals had a very, very different agenda.
[02:44:47.455 --> 02:44:48.716]  It had nothing to do with America.
[02:44:49.356 --> 02:44:55.039]  They would use America, use America funding, use American political prowess, but they really had their own agenda.
[02:44:55.059 --> 02:45:07.726]  And that's very evident in what I call the EU-SSR, because it is really, just as I describe it, a kind of new Soviet Union, if you will, that has very, very strong globalist agenda.
[02:45:08.406 --> 02:45:16.953]  And it's apparent that this transatlantic relationship, which we have largely paid for since World War II, is built on the wrong premise.
[02:45:17.234 --> 02:45:18.655]  They've taken advantage of us.
[02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:21.557]  As Trump said, you know, we were really a goat.
[02:45:22.758 --> 02:45:23.539]  They took our money.
[02:45:23.599 --> 02:45:24.560]  They took our defense.
[02:45:24.800 --> 02:45:27.222]  We paid 80% of the costs of NATO.
[02:45:28.843 --> 02:45:29.863]  And we've looked the other way.
[02:45:29.943 --> 02:45:40.187]  Germany, which is a very wealthy company, a country that's only the engine of growth in Europe, is paying less than 2% of its annual GDP for defense.
[02:45:40.207 --> 02:45:40.187]  1.32%.
[02:45:40.427 --> 02:45:48.390]  I mean, we're paying for Germany's welfare state as a result of our subsidy of NATO.
[02:45:48.630 --> 02:45:51.251]  This is the battle of these decades.
[02:45:51.631 --> 02:45:52.191]  I think we've
[02:45:53.091 --> 02:45:58.174]  I actually surprised them because we're starting to take back territory in a sense.
[02:45:58.614 --> 02:46:03.216]  I mean, the way I put it is, with Trump, we're no longer on the defensive.
[02:46:04.037 --> 02:46:04.957]  We're on the offensive.
[02:46:05.577 --> 02:46:10.820]  And everything he does, week in, actually day in, day out, that's what's so amazing about it.
[02:46:10.840 --> 02:46:16.663]  It's not just, it's not just, you know, carrying here and there willy-nilly once in a while.
[02:46:16.963 --> 02:46:19.584]  Every day something is happening on Trump's watch.
[02:46:20.085 --> 02:46:25.087]  Israel this week, you know, Jerusalem, Middle East, Russia.
[02:46:25.227 --> 02:46:29.169]  Order secured, economy coming back, and it's the perfect timing of that.
[02:46:29.209 --> 02:46:34.972]  He waited and did all this, and then just right at the right time as the stars aligned, historically, boom!
[02:46:35.492 --> 02:46:36.113]  It's biblical.
[02:46:36.813 --> 02:46:37.093]  It is.
[02:46:37.213 --> 02:46:45.316]  So I wrote an article some months ago, actually, at the time of the election, saying with Trump's election, it'll be like the first seven days of creation.
[02:46:45.896 --> 02:46:48.157]  And I meant that not literally, but metaphorically.
[02:46:48.417 --> 02:46:56.360]  And the fact is, almost everything that I laid out in that article has happened already, and we've only witnessed the first year of Donald J. Trump.
[02:47:02.062 --> 02:47:04.683]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.524 --> 02:47:13.845]  I've got a tiger in my tail!
[02:47:21.258 --> 02:47:23.419]  He never gives up.
[02:47:23.499 --> 02:47:30.362]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[02:47:30.422 --> 02:47:31.342]  And why should I give up?
[02:47:31.382 --> 02:47:33.443]  We're kicking globalist butt all over the planet.
[02:47:34.103 --> 02:47:41.526]  And all we want is classical, open, liberal, free, western society, where you can live how you want and do what you want as long as you don't hurt somebody.
[02:47:42.187 --> 02:47:43.007]  That's what it used to be.
[02:47:43.027 --> 02:47:44.348]  I wasn't a Republican or a Democrat.
[02:47:44.388 --> 02:47:49.290]  I was pro-gun and pro-sovereignty, so I was against the Federal Reserve policy, so they called me a Republican.
[02:47:50.490 --> 02:47:54.353]  I wasn't with all those blue-blood globalists and, you know, all the rest of it.
[02:47:54.393 --> 02:47:58.956]  But now the Democrats have, like, were they always this evil in modern history?
[02:47:59.036 --> 02:48:00.317]  Or did they just mutate?
[02:48:00.977 --> 02:48:02.998]  Milo, Millie, got a bunch of topics we're going to hit.
[02:48:03.018 --> 02:48:04.219]  We're going to get to Millie's big report here.
[02:48:04.239 --> 02:48:05.520]  They were always this evil, yes.
[02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:06.481]  They were always this evil.
[02:48:06.501 --> 02:48:08.702]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:48:09.002 --> 02:48:09.643]  You surprise me.
[02:48:09.663 --> 02:48:13.085]  You're not a McConnell and Bill Kristol intimate.
[02:48:13.966 --> 02:48:15.066]  No, I don't like the evil.
[02:48:15.287 --> 02:48:16.187]  Because they're bad, too.
[02:48:16.207 --> 02:48:16.888]  I always hated them.
[02:48:16.908 --> 02:48:19.329]  But the Democrats are now, like, clearly, like,
[02:48:21.872 --> 02:48:23.093]  The Exorcist or something?
[02:48:23.113 --> 02:48:23.573]  No, no, no.
[02:48:23.753 --> 02:48:25.415]  There's something demonic about it.
[02:48:25.435 --> 02:48:35.605]  There's something, you know, there's something deranged about the level of inhumanity and hypocrisy and cruelty and meanness and the detachment from reality and reason and logic.
[02:48:35.625 --> 02:48:35.986]  That's right.
[02:48:36.166 --> 02:48:38.028]  There's an immature selfishness that drives it.
[02:48:38.328 --> 02:48:47.915]  The globalists have fully taken over the Democrat Party, whereas the American people are starting to take back the Republican Party, save for a couple of the rhinos out there, like John McCain.
[02:48:48.215 --> 02:48:49.476]  That's right, Millie.
[02:48:49.576 --> 02:48:56.321]  That was the party that we could at least target to try to get a foothold with, and that's what we got control of, partially.
[02:48:57.076 --> 02:48:57.396]  That's right.
[02:48:57.436 --> 02:48:58.077]  We took it back.
[02:48:58.197 --> 02:48:58.777]  That's the difference.
[02:48:58.997 --> 02:49:02.800]  The globalists still fully control and operate the Democratic Party.
[02:49:03.221 --> 02:49:11.107]  So when you're seeing the Democrats going up against President Trump, trying to take him out, that's the globalists that do not want America First policy.
[02:49:11.127 --> 02:49:13.488]  That's a multinational combine, and it's true.
[02:49:14.069 --> 02:49:15.170]  And Trump points it out.
[02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.870]  It's game over.
[02:49:16.130 --> 02:49:20.073]  As soon as the president got it and pointed it out, we're not going to have secret groups running the country anymore.
[02:49:20.113 --> 02:49:20.474]  Game over.
[02:49:21.363 --> 02:49:28.510]  Yeah, and you know, these forces are just as powerful in the upper echelons of the Republican Party as they are in the upper echelons of the Democrat Party.
[02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:42.504]  But something about the character of, I guess because there's something about the individualism of people who believe in, you know, faith, flag, freedom, First and Second Amendment fundamentalists, you know, something about the Republican side means that the voter base
[02:49:43.244 --> 02:49:52.646]  Uh, is more hostile to state control, to those globalist tendencies, to social justice, to all of those kinds of, you know, overarching mechanisms of control and authoritarianism.
[02:49:52.946 --> 02:49:59.628]  Something about the Republican base, the base of conservative voters in this country, um, splintered off.
[02:49:59.948 --> 02:50:06.510]  And, you know, left-wing voters seem relatively well-prepared to accept their lives being run by other people.
[02:50:06.550 --> 02:50:07.970]  In fact, many of them seem to crave it.
[02:50:08.070 --> 02:50:08.570]  Exactly.
[02:50:08.610 --> 02:50:11.731]  And it was the final attempt when we tried to get them off our back.
[02:50:12.671 --> 02:50:16.815]  To just say, no, we're going to run your life completely, that now people are like, we're done, we're never going to go along with you.
[02:50:17.055 --> 02:50:22.299]  Now, you're coming up at the start of the next hour, Miller, we're going to get into your report that just went live on Infowars.com.
[02:50:22.719 --> 02:50:28.844]  Democrat policies create SH-T holes, then they exploit the
[02:50:29.665 --> 02:50:30.245]  Crap holes.
[02:50:30.525 --> 02:50:32.846]  Then they bulldoze the crap holes.
[02:50:32.866 --> 02:50:34.427]  You shouldn't say CNN out loud.
[02:50:34.447 --> 02:50:35.387]  You're quite proper.
[02:50:35.447 --> 02:50:35.847]  I've noticed.
[02:50:35.927 --> 02:50:37.007]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:50:37.028 --> 02:50:39.168]  The Democrats still control the FCC at the low level.
[02:50:39.328 --> 02:50:44.790]  You know, he's quite proper because, like, CNN will say it out loud, but you don't like to cuss, do you?
[02:50:44.810 --> 02:50:46.311]  We'll have to delay it for the stations.
[02:50:46.351 --> 02:50:47.471]  We're on TV stations, too.
[02:50:47.491 --> 02:50:50.072]  They'll use any excuse they can to try to shut him down.
[02:50:50.652 --> 02:50:54.856]  They don't send, they don't send the FCC, right, because they have a special leftist in there.
[02:50:55.176 --> 02:51:00.581]  When they see it, they check, they go back, and then they go after our affiliates, and they send a leftist to find them.
[02:51:00.941 --> 02:51:04.464]  And the people at the stations go, wait, everybody else, they go, shut up!
[02:51:04.945 --> 02:51:05.665]  Here's your fine!
[02:51:05.685 --> 02:51:07.006]  Again, it's the same deal.
[02:51:07.187 --> 02:51:08.788]  So we are to a higher standard.
[02:51:09.328 --> 02:51:10.809]  Yeah, no, that's perfectly true.
[02:51:10.829 --> 02:51:18.095]  And the report, if you look at the, um, let's say for the sake of argument that the acorn thing and one other thing about Breitbart, for instance, is true.
[02:51:18.415 --> 02:51:19.836]  It's the same thing, they always hop on.
[02:51:20.176 --> 02:51:23.819]  Two, let's call them mistakes, although I don't think in either case it's as clear-cut as that.
[02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:38.194]  In the history of an entire publication, which are relentlessly jammed down Alex Marlowe's throat over there, versus not just way more mistakes, but deliberate, purposeful, premeditated mendacity on the part of CNN.
[02:51:38.454 --> 02:51:42.558]  They don't lie to their viewers by accident, they lie to their viewers every day on purpose.
[02:51:42.578 --> 02:51:44.340]  Yeah, yeah, we all make mistakes.
[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:46.402]  It's American Pravda, essentially.
[02:51:46.502 --> 02:51:47.924]  Look at everywhere Democrats run.
[02:51:47.944 --> 02:51:53.409]  They are, even though there's some nice parts, a lot of stuff's nice in Chicago, it's got kind of like little S.H.
[02:51:53.449 --> 02:51:54.490]  you-know-what holes here and there.
[02:51:54.911 --> 02:51:57.173]  New York's got a lot of great stuff, but, you know, Maryland.
[02:51:57.193 --> 02:51:59.596]  But the true latrines, the true feces holes, the true scat holes,
[02:52:06.362 --> 02:52:25.248]  In America, and all over the world, our liberal-run and communist-run areas are, if you want to find, looking at a world map, look at those maps, if you want to find the hell holes, the crap holes, the scum holes, the nightmare holes, and not the glorious area holes, then you have to sit there and look at communist areas.
[02:52:25.268 --> 02:52:33.390]  Well, as an expert on glorious holes, um, no, I can't, look at that, just look at this within this- America, isn't America compared to China glorious?
[02:52:33.691 --> 02:52:34.911]  We're talking about countries as holes.
[02:52:35.392 --> 02:52:36.093]  What is America?
[02:52:36.113 --> 02:52:38.177]  Is America not a glory hole?
[02:52:38.759 --> 02:52:40.362]  America is the greatest glory hole of all.
[02:52:45.989 --> 02:52:47.690]  All you have to do is look within the country itself.
[02:52:48.451 --> 02:52:49.432]  Newark, New Jersey.
[02:52:49.652 --> 02:52:50.453]  Flint, Michigan.
[02:52:50.793 --> 02:52:51.614]  Chicago.
[02:52:51.954 --> 02:52:53.295]  They all have one thing in common.
[02:52:54.196 --> 02:52:55.477]  And they're all Democrat-run.
[02:52:55.497 --> 02:52:56.398]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:52:56.478 --> 02:52:59.341]  I thought you were mentioning the SHI's.
[02:52:59.361 --> 02:53:00.222]  No, no, no.
[02:53:00.402 --> 02:53:03.425]  I meant that they've all been run by Democrats for decades.
[02:53:03.625 --> 02:53:06.588]  So, CNN is the whole...
[02:53:07.549 --> 02:53:11.432]  Network, but are not Democrat cities the whole areas?
[02:53:11.832 --> 02:53:12.372]  Of course!
[02:53:12.533 --> 02:53:15.074]  Austin's the only one that isn't that and they're trying to make it one.
[02:53:15.595 --> 02:53:26.943]  Oh, they are trying so hard and a lot of people are moving from the Democrat cities because they've become such rundown places to live and of course they're going to move to Texas and other places and start voting Democrat.
[02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:27.944]  They're not going to change.
[02:53:27.964 --> 02:53:31.326]  They're not going to realize that Democrat policies left.
[02:53:31.346 --> 02:53:32.747]  They leave one toilet.
[02:53:33.127 --> 02:53:39.048]  You voted for Democrats there, it didn't work.
[02:53:39.068 --> 02:53:44.810]  Now you're going to come over here and ruin our spots by voting Democrat here and not realizing exactly the same thing is going to happen.
[02:53:45.550 --> 02:53:46.070]  Very frustrating.
[02:53:46.090 --> 02:53:47.610]  They know though, like you said, they're managing it.
[02:53:47.630 --> 02:53:48.250]  So that's coming up.
[02:53:48.270 --> 02:53:49.611]  But let's get to something really serious here.
[02:53:49.631 --> 02:53:51.691]  It's a story on InfoWars.com.
[02:53:51.871 --> 02:53:53.252]  It's from the Chicago Tribune.
[02:53:54.212 --> 02:53:57.653]  But even the headline out of Information Liberation isn't strong enough.
[02:53:57.713 --> 02:53:59.073]  The guy has pled guilty.
[02:53:59.853 --> 02:54:09.599]  Okay, he admits to raping, sexually assaulting a 6 and 8 year old, 38 year old Chicago man, but he says it's okay because he is trans age.
[02:54:10.019 --> 02:54:23.707]  And that, I've learned, is the thing to say that, no seriously, they're saying, even in England, well we're going to let a guy that identifies as a, you know, 5 year old who's 60 years old come play with your daughter, and if you don't do it, you're a age-a-phobe.
[02:54:24.248 --> 02:54:25.288]  You're a trans age-a-phobe.
[02:54:26.749 --> 02:54:28.633]  Well how old is he identifying as?
[02:54:28.773 --> 02:54:29.234]  I'm curious.
[02:54:29.535 --> 02:54:32.020]  He identifies as a nine-year-old.
[02:54:32.681 --> 02:54:33.122]  Oh my goodness.
[02:54:33.142 --> 02:54:36.729]  He says he's a nine-year-old trapped in an adult fat slob's body.
[02:54:37.952 --> 02:54:39.173]  I mean, and of course, look at it.
[02:54:39.233 --> 02:54:44.555]  Can you imagine this guy, like, under NAMBLA rules, they wouldn't be able to have this guy come and have your seven-year-old daughter grow up with him.
[02:54:44.575 --> 02:54:47.936]  You know, they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but that is a kiddie fiddler.
[02:54:49.197 --> 02:54:58.420]  Do you remember when we were all laughed at and we said, look, if you go down this road, if you let people pick their own pronouns, decide one day that they're women, decide one day that they're this, it's going to end in madness.
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:54:59.481]  And we were all laughed at.
[02:54:59.641 --> 02:55:00.241]  We were all laughed at.
[02:55:00.601 --> 02:55:07.824]  Three years ago, I did a joke video, way before Rachel Dolezal or Sean King, where I came out as transracial, you know, as a joke.
[02:55:07.884 --> 02:55:08.385]  I don't know.
[02:55:26.906 --> 02:55:35.315]  I made a whole joke that said, I identify as Colonel Sanders, and you better accept it, because California will arrest you if some dude with a beard and tattoos says, I'm a woman, and you don't agree.
[02:55:35.355 --> 02:55:39.560]  Did you see where the man came in to the National Health Service and said, give me a pap smear?
[02:55:39.980 --> 02:55:44.365]  And the lady said, dude, you've literally got, you know, beard and tattoos.
[02:55:44.385 --> 02:55:45.506]  You have no cervix.
[02:55:47.108 --> 02:55:48.289]  Trans-zoological.
[02:55:48.329 --> 02:55:49.529]  Trans-species.
[02:55:49.709 --> 02:55:58.973]  Well, what about when animals, you know, their carers decide to say, you know, my animal, my cow, actually identifies as a human and should have human rights?
[02:55:59.033 --> 02:56:00.373]  Where does the insanity stop?
[02:56:00.413 --> 02:56:03.334]  Wasn't there that woman who wants to marry a chandelier or something?
[02:56:03.354 --> 02:56:04.175]  That's right!
[02:56:04.335 --> 02:56:05.055]  A lamp!
[02:56:05.115 --> 02:56:05.875]  A lamp!
[02:56:05.895 --> 02:56:06.976]  She wants to marry a lamp!
[02:56:07.336 --> 02:56:08.297]  That's a huge movement.
[02:56:08.317 --> 02:56:10.498]  They have TV shows about guys that have sex with their cars.
[02:56:10.898 --> 02:56:13.239]  So I said, do I have to learn the acronym and get it right?
[02:56:13.459 --> 02:56:18.521]  And they went, Jones claims gay men are going to break in your house and rape your car.
[02:56:18.541 --> 02:56:19.302]  You didn't do it.
[02:56:19.322 --> 02:56:20.362]  It was on television.
[02:56:20.382 --> 02:56:22.983]  But I didn't say it was a gay guy wanting to have sex with a car.
[02:56:23.143 --> 02:56:26.425]  I said, what do you call a movement of having sex with inanimate objects?
[02:56:26.445 --> 02:56:28.286]  It probably is a gay guy though, isn't it?
[02:56:29.406 --> 02:56:31.227]  I don't know, maybe he thinks like a pink Ferrari.
[02:56:31.267 --> 02:56:45.415]  You're not supposed to say this, because, you know, the gay lobby has been for years trying to say don't make any connection or confusion between gay people and, you know, and all of these other weird various fetishes and sexual deviancies and all the rest of it.
[02:56:45.835 --> 02:56:51.298]  But there does seem to be a preponderance of homosexuals in all of these weird... It's called necrophilia.
[02:56:52.679 --> 02:56:54.621]  I've also seen... Machiophilia.
[02:56:54.861 --> 02:56:55.621]  Machiophilia.
[02:56:55.641 --> 02:56:58.183]  Want to have sex with helicopters, ships, airplanes?
[02:56:58.924 --> 02:57:01.346]  Although, actually, are cars like ships?
[02:57:01.406 --> 02:57:02.046]  Are they female?
[02:57:02.266 --> 02:57:02.807]  Is it her?
[02:57:03.547 --> 02:57:04.128]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:57:04.188 --> 02:57:05.148]  Is it popular culture?
[02:57:05.168 --> 02:57:06.590]  There's plenty of pervs that are gay.
[02:57:06.630 --> 02:57:08.271]  But there's plenty of heterosexual pervs.
[02:57:08.291 --> 02:57:09.011]  There's plenty.
[02:57:09.071 --> 02:57:11.573]  What if I wanted to have sex with that television set?
[02:57:12.114 --> 02:57:14.295]  What if I identify as a TV?
[02:57:14.355 --> 02:57:15.897]  What gender is that TV?
[02:57:16.437 --> 02:57:18.579]  I think it's red, white, and blue.
[02:57:18.739 --> 02:57:19.379]  It's elegant.
[02:57:20.040 --> 02:57:21.501]  It's... No, it must be a woman.
[02:57:21.869 --> 02:57:23.771]  It might be trans-multi-dimensional.
[02:57:24.031 --> 02:57:24.451]  Who knows?
[02:57:24.532 --> 02:57:29.276]  Did you hear where the Google execs walk in and go, I am a golden dragon in a beautiful ornate building?
[02:57:29.476 --> 02:57:32.559]  And they make the employees go, you are an ornate building, sir.
[02:57:32.719 --> 02:57:33.400]  Ornate building.
[02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:34.681]  Yellow dragon.
[02:57:35.061 --> 02:57:35.762]  Oh my goodness.
[02:57:36.162 --> 02:57:42.308]  We laugh about it, but they've got our kids in the public schools right now, like Camille Paglia says, brain-damaging them severely.
[02:57:42.328 --> 02:57:43.649]  Someone called me on my show yesterday.
[02:57:43.689 --> 02:57:45.351]  They said I have a friend who's got kids.
[02:57:45.391 --> 02:57:46.692]  They're seven and they're nine years old.
[02:57:46.712 --> 02:57:47.293]  Hold on, we gotta go to break.
[02:57:47.853 --> 02:57:48.333]  Not a group.
[02:57:48.393 --> 02:57:49.774]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[02:57:49.834 --> 02:57:50.895]  It took you over a year to do it.
[02:57:51.155 --> 02:57:52.096]  Why is this so good?
[02:57:52.376 --> 02:57:57.599]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[02:57:57.679 --> 02:58:11.247]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:58:11.307 --> 02:58:12.688]  Right now with all the refugees,
[02:58:13.588 --> 02:58:15.029]  Spreading disease around.
[02:58:15.109 --> 02:58:17.592]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[02:58:17.692 --> 02:58:18.953]  These are all parasites.
[02:58:18.993 --> 02:58:20.094]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[02:58:20.114 --> 02:58:21.134]  There's so many things that are in it.
[02:58:21.455 --> 02:58:25.798]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:58:25.998 --> 02:58:29.161]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:58:29.261 --> 02:58:32.322]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:58:32.362 --> 02:58:33.343]  It just came back in yesterday.
[02:58:33.403 --> 02:58:35.284]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:35.344 --> 02:58:36.384]  And folks, you can't lose.
[02:58:36.664 --> 02:58:38.465]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[02:58:39.105 --> 02:58:42.126]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[02:58:42.387 --> 02:58:44.267]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[02:58:44.647 --> 02:58:46.628]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[02:58:51.050 --> 02:58:55.372]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[02:58:56.512 --> 02:58:57.233]  Optimum levels.
[02:58:58.308 --> 02:59:02.911]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:02.931 --> 02:59:04.872]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:05.272 --> 02:59:06.833]  B vitamins we need every day.
[02:59:07.053 --> 02:59:12.136]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[02:59:12.336 --> 02:59:14.017]  O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[02:59:14.657 --> 02:59:19.860]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:20.640]  Secret 12.
[02:59:20.680 --> 02:59:21.461]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[02:59:21.821 --> 02:59:22.161]  I think so.
[02:59:51.909 --> 02:59:56.212]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:59:56.372 --> 03:00:03.197]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.237 --> 03:00:05.759]  Because there is a war on.
[03:00:05.899 --> 03:00:06.939]  Or you're mine.
[03:00:13.508 --> 03:00:17.090]  Alright, it certainly happened today.
[03:00:17.150 --> 03:00:21.153]  Millie Weaver, of course we have the one, the only, Milo Yiannopoulos in studio with us.
[03:00:21.593 --> 03:00:26.516]  It's been a family show, because they're teaching this to little kids, you know, trying to change their sex or whatever.
[03:00:26.536 --> 03:00:27.577]  So we've got to talk about this.
[03:00:27.957 --> 03:00:29.378]  We laugh about it, but it's really scary.
[03:00:29.398 --> 03:00:30.799]  But you mentioned it during the break, Millie.
[03:00:31.279 --> 03:00:31.439]  Yes.
[03:00:31.459 --> 03:00:35.101]  I happened to have the article from fullwars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:35.121 --> 03:00:36.782]  This article won't be seen unless you get it out, folks.
[03:00:37.242 --> 03:00:39.364]  And it says, CNN promotes cuckoldry.
[03:00:39.964 --> 03:00:42.165]  As positive for modern relationships.
[03:00:42.185 --> 03:00:45.627]  I remember about three, four years ago, Paul kept saying, leftists are cucks.
[03:00:46.147 --> 03:00:47.148]  And I went, what's a cuck?
[03:00:47.188 --> 03:00:48.408]  He had to explain it to me.
[03:00:49.169 --> 03:00:55.692]  So I guess if you don't let like, you know, just a busload of dudes have your wife or whatever, you're not a good guy.
[03:00:55.712 --> 03:00:57.573]  And I keep seeing leftist media.
[03:00:58.664 --> 03:01:06.906]  They promote this as a great idea, but it's never, oh, have your wife watch while you have sex with a bunch of women or guys, because that would be abusive.
[03:01:06.946 --> 03:01:08.407]  No, no, just your wife.
[03:01:08.467 --> 03:01:13.568]  She needs to have sex with other men in front of you, even though they know statistically this is the fastest way to break up a relationship.
[03:01:13.788 --> 03:01:17.689]  Of course, introducing other people into a relationship is the first step to breaking up, right?
[03:01:17.809 --> 03:01:21.050]  And just as you were saying, Milo, CNN's just pandering to their own audience.
[03:01:21.130 --> 03:01:21.870]  They are cucks.
[03:01:22.891 --> 03:01:24.712]  And I must hand it to Paul Watson.
[03:01:25.052 --> 03:01:30.836]  He called it on the Soy Boys because literally after the Women's March, the floor was littered with soy lattes.
[03:01:31.157 --> 03:01:31.657]  Literally.
[03:01:31.677 --> 03:01:32.417]  Okay?
[03:01:32.538 --> 03:01:33.338]  I videotaped it.
[03:01:33.418 --> 03:01:33.738]  Everything.
[03:01:33.818 --> 03:01:34.399]  And now this.
[03:01:34.619 --> 03:01:38.642]  And CNN's even talking about how wonderful cuckoldry can be for a race.
[03:01:38.662 --> 03:01:39.182]  And think about it.
[03:01:39.262 --> 03:01:41.284]  They know it's the number one way to break up.
[03:01:42.024 --> 03:01:43.326]  In a relationship or marriage.
[03:01:43.686 --> 03:01:45.127]  And they're telling married women do it.
[03:01:45.167 --> 03:01:45.988]  It's everywhere now.
[03:01:46.008 --> 03:01:47.349]  I don't even know what it was four years ago.
[03:01:47.770 --> 03:01:48.170]  Everywhere.
[03:01:48.250 --> 03:01:49.271]  Cut, cut, cut.
[03:01:49.351 --> 03:01:50.552]  Your wife's gotta do what she wants.
[03:01:50.612 --> 03:01:51.012]  You don't.
[03:01:51.073 --> 03:01:51.713]  You stay home.
[03:01:52.254 --> 03:01:55.997]  It's like, break the... I mean, CNN's literally trying to break your family up.
[03:01:56.778 --> 03:01:58.219]  They are like Loki.
[03:01:58.239 --> 03:01:59.180]  They're like demons.
[03:01:59.580 --> 03:02:02.641]  Well, I wouldn't be so mean about the God of Mischief.
[03:02:03.101 --> 03:02:06.623]  Loki is innocent in all of this.
[03:02:06.683 --> 03:02:08.123]  These people are devils.
[03:02:08.603 --> 03:02:18.527]  You know, I mean, the extent to which the media will make space for and will provide coverage for things that are anti-family.
[03:02:19.307 --> 03:02:21.530]  Anti, you know, traditional values, all the rest of it.
[03:02:21.570 --> 03:02:28.359]  Despite the wealth of evidence that shows us that, you know, children do better in nuclear families, people do better in monogamous relationships, everyone does better.
[03:02:28.379 --> 03:02:29.441]  Because this is totally normal.
[03:02:30.536 --> 03:02:36.319]  Well, I mean, you know, obviously in the cuckolding scenario, I'm the wife, so I have a slightly different perspective on all of this.
[03:02:36.419 --> 03:02:41.722]  I'm the one with the basketball player, while my rich elderly husband watches on in panic and horror.
[03:02:42.062 --> 03:02:45.024]  No, I'm just kidding.
[03:02:45.044 --> 03:02:50.106]  But the key to understanding all of this is that, you know, they have tried for a long time to put this all together.
[03:02:50.166 --> 03:02:57.210]  Finally, they've got Dan Savage, who's this wacky gay journalist, who in 2002 used to say really sound stuff about Islam.
[03:02:57.711 --> 03:03:08.102]  Sure, they say in the article he's the leader, this gay guy is telling everybody, hey, let your wife have sex with other guys, because we're going to break your family up.
[03:03:12.627 --> 03:03:26.421]  I'm surprised that we're not actually hearing more about teachers teaching children about polygamous relationships in school and saying how wonderful cuckoldry can be.
[03:03:26.481 --> 03:03:30.405]  Well, I'm not trying to act cool, but I've been promiscuous earlier in my life.
[03:03:32.501 --> 03:03:36.405]  I never, I mean, I never liked it and I had girlfriends that thought, hey baby, you want it?
[03:03:36.445 --> 03:03:39.769]  I was like, no, I really don't want to, you know, it's not a good deal.
[03:03:39.829 --> 03:03:41.170]  He's got that Trump thing, like I get it.
[03:03:41.190 --> 03:03:43.273]  You know, like I get why women would swoon over him.
[03:03:43.433 --> 03:03:44.394]  Oh yeah, right.
[03:03:44.754 --> 03:03:45.815]  I'm not bragging about it.
[03:03:46.096 --> 03:03:47.517]  The point is... No, no, it's fine.
[03:03:47.597 --> 03:03:51.142]  No, I didn't want girlfriends who bring other women in, is what I'm saying.
[03:03:51.243 --> 03:03:52.164]  It was never other guys.
[03:03:52.565 --> 03:03:55.689]  And I was like, no baby, I don't need to... you're good.
[03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:59.535]  Because it's like, with your woman, with your wife, that's the connection.
[03:04:00.096 --> 03:04:03.180]  Everybody who's done menage a trois, I'll be honest, knows they suck.
[03:04:03.641 --> 03:04:04.322]  In my experience.
[03:04:04.462 --> 03:04:04.802]  They do.
[03:04:05.002 --> 03:04:16.912]  I think this comes down to something very simple which is that many of the journalists writing these stories are single and miserable and bitter and in their thirties they were lied to by feminine... Yeah, they think menage a trois are great.
[03:04:16.972 --> 03:04:17.432]  They're not.
[03:04:17.692 --> 03:04:18.133]  They're not.
[03:04:18.473 --> 03:04:18.913]  They're not.
[03:04:18.993 --> 03:04:21.876]  These people strike me as deeply loveless.
[03:04:22.296 --> 03:04:30.099]  When you have a real, abiding, sincere, profound love in your life, the idea of bringing somebody else into the bedroom is horrifying.
[03:04:30.459 --> 03:04:33.020]  And doing it, of course, is going to break up your marriage.
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:35.601]  Exactly, because you sync up with the person you love.
[03:04:35.621 --> 03:04:36.301]  Of course.
[03:04:36.381 --> 03:04:37.541]  It goes without saying, but I think
[03:04:39.482 --> 03:04:48.608]  I think that the majority of these liberal journalists, the vice writers who write these stories about, oh, men are fooling around with men in unprecedented numbers because of blah blah blah.
[03:04:49.008 --> 03:04:50.129]  I think they're just loveless.
[03:04:50.909 --> 03:04:54.972]  And I think if you look at... And they're scared to ask women out because that's rape now.
[03:04:55.252 --> 03:04:57.113]  We'll be right back with Milo, a million more.
[03:04:59.614 --> 03:05:01.596]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:05:01.676 --> 03:05:01.976]  Go ahead.
[03:05:02.355 --> 03:05:04.536]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[03:05:04.556 --> 03:05:07.537]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:05:08.378 --> 03:05:09.518]  It just gets old, man.
[03:05:09.799 --> 03:05:11.519]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:05:12.220 --> 03:05:14.301]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:05:14.541 --> 03:05:18.543]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:05:18.563 --> 03:05:20.984]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:05:21.864 --> 03:05:24.185]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:05:24.545 --> 03:05:25.606]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:05:25.906 --> 03:05:26.786]  Us being shut down?
[03:05:27.006 --> 03:05:28.067]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:05:28.487 --> 03:05:29.527]  You know what, Alex?
[03:05:29.567 --> 03:05:30.648]  Put him on pause again.
[03:05:30.668 --> 03:05:31.488]  Hey, Frank!
[03:05:31.768 --> 03:05:37.110]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:05:37.430 --> 03:05:41.712]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:05:41.952 --> 03:05:44.813]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:05:45.073 --> 03:05:45.474]  You understand?
[03:05:45.554 --> 03:05:46.814]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:05:47.194 --> 03:05:48.315]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:05:49.315 --> 03:05:54.739]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:05:54.900 --> 03:05:55.620]  Do you understand?
[03:05:55.640 --> 03:05:56.881]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:05:56.901 --> 03:05:58.803]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:06:05.008 --> 03:06:08.731]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[03:06:09.311 --> 03:06:11.213]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:15.906 --> 03:06:20.107]  All right, we got Milo Yiannopoulos here, InfoWars.com reporter, Millie Weaver.
[03:06:20.167 --> 03:06:28.969]  Get his book, Dangerous, at InfoWarsStore.com, but his website, Dangerous.com, and sign up for all his big exclusive shows and transmissions if you want to fight censorship.
[03:06:29.009 --> 03:06:32.050]  And just briefly, because I get, you know,
[03:06:32.443 --> 03:06:32.923]  We're good.
[03:06:51.047 --> 03:06:51.247]  I don't
[03:07:07.315 --> 03:07:13.297]  And everywhere I go, this company kills it, that company kills it, then the major credit card companies kill it, even though I have great credit.
[03:07:13.857 --> 03:07:17.398]  I've met with the lawyers, the lawsuits have started, I've been signed on to some of the Google lawsuits.
[03:07:17.679 --> 03:07:19.379]  My name's Enim, I told you I was meeting with people.
[03:07:19.679 --> 03:07:26.762]  I can't get into all these lawsuits, but I'm involved in four lawsuits right now against tech companies, and some of them are already trying to settle with me.
[03:07:27.242 --> 03:07:29.122]  So, let's just get this straight.
[03:07:29.283 --> 03:07:31.083]  I am fighting back, not because I'm litigious.
[03:07:31.383 --> 03:07:32.164]  I don't even want money!
[03:07:32.464 --> 03:07:33.384]  I'm just like, stop!
[03:07:34.384 --> 03:07:35.005]  I'm literally...
[03:07:36.525 --> 03:07:42.349]  The left kept saying what Trump's done to women is like, you know, what Hitler did to Jewish women or something.
[03:07:42.369 --> 03:07:42.769]  It's crazy.
[03:07:43.149 --> 03:07:52.855]  Meanwhile, just what Matt Drozd warned of, I'm being blocked, Milo's being blocked from going out on the new big credit card and money exchanges and even getting websites, even being in commerce.
[03:07:53.175 --> 03:07:56.157]  I mean, that's true blockade.
[03:07:56.257 --> 03:07:57.618]  It's military attack.
[03:07:57.758 --> 03:08:01.500]  It's sanctions like I'm Russia.
[03:08:01.540 --> 03:08:02.981]  So I'm not complaining to the audience.
[03:08:03.081 --> 03:08:03.722]  I'm just saying,
[03:08:04.679 --> 03:08:05.880]  We get too cheerful here.
[03:08:06.621 --> 03:08:19.210]  You're all we've got, and we're persevering thanks to you, but get great supplements, get great films, get great books, check out the great products, and do it knowing you are in their face, defying George Soros, who's behind it all.
[03:08:19.230 --> 03:08:22.853]  I don't want to give him extra magical powers, but my God, nine times out of ten, it's him.
[03:08:23.153 --> 03:08:24.694]  This guy is just unbelievable.
[03:08:25.095 --> 03:08:27.256]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[03:08:28.297 --> 03:08:32.278]  We've got our new ultimate turmeric product, BODYEASE.
[03:08:32.358 --> 03:08:33.899]  If you don't know what turmeric does, research it.
[03:08:33.959 --> 03:08:34.379]  It's incredible.
[03:08:34.399 --> 03:08:36.640]  It's the strongest, most concentrated form out there.
[03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:37.220]  Great reviews.
[03:08:37.740 --> 03:08:41.061]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:08:41.101 --> 03:08:48.224]  We have Pollen Block, which, again, is a very proprietary, non-GMO system.
[03:08:48.364 --> 03:08:49.544]  I'm already feeling cleaner.
[03:08:50.004 --> 03:08:50.204]  Really?
[03:08:50.244 --> 03:08:50.924]  Well, you got Dawson.
[03:08:50.944 --> 03:08:51.805]  You got hit with the allergies.
[03:08:52.025 --> 03:08:52.865]  No, no, I did.
[03:08:52.905 --> 03:08:55.146]  I'm no longer... Tell folks what happened.
[03:08:56.186 --> 03:08:58.087]  Seriously, bodies!
[03:08:58.127 --> 03:09:03.068]  Look, I can't tell you anything other than... Look, I came in here with a bunged up nose and now I don't have one.
[03:09:03.088 --> 03:09:05.069]  I'm not... So I'm ranting.
[03:09:05.089 --> 03:09:07.090]  Every time I come here I end up popping a pill.
[03:09:07.490 --> 03:09:08.170]  I'm sorry, right?
[03:09:08.190 --> 03:09:10.851]  Because Brain Force last time, this time it's pollen.
[03:09:10.891 --> 03:09:13.031]  I mean, I don't know... I do feel better.
[03:09:13.852 --> 03:09:14.552]  Did Brain Force work?
[03:09:15.552 --> 03:09:17.113]  Well, it was a good show, don't you remember?
[03:09:17.133 --> 03:09:24.595]  When we did that read-through of the Newsweek special, the Madame President and with our Cosmos, I would say Brain Force worked.
[03:09:24.615 --> 03:09:25.656]  That was an amazing show.
[03:09:25.736 --> 03:09:27.936]  I remember watching it and just laughing so hard.
[03:09:27.997 --> 03:09:28.697]  It was amazing.
[03:09:28.737 --> 03:09:31.198]  I was smiling for about a week afterwards.
[03:09:31.218 --> 03:09:36.940]  By the way, Milo, I've met you a few times and you were in a good mood and really smart and funny and you came here before, but you're on fire.
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:37.900]  What the hell's going on?
[03:09:38.994 --> 03:09:40.555]  Um, well thank you for that.
[03:09:40.575 --> 03:09:47.479]  I'm not normally intimidated, but I mean you are just the charisma, the energy, the... I'm kind of like feeling a little junior here right now.
[03:09:47.539 --> 03:09:49.280]  I'm feeling cucked!
[03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:51.261]  Um, yes, she's mine.
[03:09:52.221 --> 03:09:53.302]  No, thank you for saying so.
[03:09:53.342 --> 03:09:54.262]  I think I stopped drinking.
[03:09:54.743 --> 03:09:56.283]  Um, and in love.
[03:09:56.403 --> 03:09:56.904]  Married now.
[03:09:57.084 --> 03:10:02.547]  I think, you know you get sort of this... Well I told you, you didn't look bad before like me, but you look about ten years younger.
[03:10:03.047 --> 03:10:03.647]  I don't know about that.
[03:10:03.667 --> 03:10:05.128]  He's got the newlywed glow.
[03:10:05.508 --> 03:10:07.889]  No, I mean, I do feel happier.
[03:10:07.950 --> 03:10:21.837]  Anyway, I love compliments, but I want to pay you one, which is, you were talking earlier on, you know, I remember when I had just started to hear about you, whatever it was, five years ago, and people were laughing, oh, this guy who says George Soros is behind everything.
[03:10:22.237 --> 03:10:28.780]  One of the things that I liked most about you was that you were, look, everybody knows, there's this think tank
[03:10:28.780 --> 03:10:30.041]  There are a lot of think tanks who do this research.
[03:10:30.061 --> 03:10:40.710]  The Capital Research Center, which impeccable credentials, Washington DC Republican think tank that does research into where the money comes from for Antifa, where the money comes from for the divestment sanctions Israel.
[03:10:40.970 --> 03:10:44.393]  They know that you're right about all this stuff, but does National Review write about it?
[03:10:44.653 --> 03:10:44.813]  No.
[03:10:45.354 --> 03:10:47.275]  Does Fox News talk about it?
[03:10:47.475 --> 03:10:49.217]  Not really, not enough.
[03:10:49.277 --> 03:10:50.778]  Weekly Standard, commentary magazine?
[03:10:50.858 --> 03:10:50.998]  No.
[03:10:51.018 --> 03:10:56.663]  You're the only guy who's been out there for years saying, this is this guy, and this is what he wants, and this is what he's trying to do.
[03:10:56.823 --> 03:10:58.925]  I just know every time I'm getting screwed over, it's him!
[03:10:58.945 --> 03:10:59.446]  It is!
[03:10:59.646 --> 03:11:02.449]  You trace the money back and it ends up being Open Society Foundation.
[03:11:03.090 --> 03:11:04.211]  Republicans know this.
[03:11:04.772 --> 03:11:10.558]  They know it because think tanks with impeccable credentials like the Capital Research Center, you know, trace the money.
[03:11:10.578 --> 03:11:13.521]  They follow the money and they're like, oh, okay, we were right, it was George Soros.
[03:11:13.541 --> 03:11:14.342]  Let's move on to the next thing.
[03:11:14.662 --> 03:11:16.124]  Nobody talks about it!
[03:11:16.144 --> 03:11:16.865]  Nobody tells anyone!
[03:11:17.125 --> 03:11:25.914]  Meanwhile, he's suing everybody, he infiltrates groups, he finances BuzzFeed, he's a Nazi collaborator, and then they have CNN go, Alex Jones is a liar!
[03:11:26.215 --> 03:11:28.117]  George Soros never had anything to do with the Nazis!
[03:11:28.417 --> 03:11:30.539]  That guy was on 60 Minutes saying he worked for him!
[03:11:30.779 --> 03:11:33.142]  His dad wrote an autobiography that he helped round him up!
[03:11:33.682 --> 03:11:37.066]  He funded the groups that derailed my Berkeley speech in February.
[03:11:37.627 --> 03:11:38.688]  We found out after the fact.
[03:11:38.708 --> 03:11:41.271]  It was an Open Society Foundation thing.
[03:11:41.491 --> 03:11:41.851]  Exactly!
[03:11:41.871 --> 03:11:46.496]  I don't want to give him this much power, but he is literally... I mean, this is domestic terrorism.
[03:11:46.516 --> 03:11:54.585]  This is people taking weapon, you know, pepper spray and baseball bats and smashing up public buildings because a conservative is speaking.
[03:11:54.805 --> 03:11:55.226]  Speaking!
[03:11:55.947 --> 03:12:01.996]  And not just beating up the conservatives, but beating up people who weren't even fans, who just came along because they were sort of interested in it.
[03:12:02.096 --> 03:12:06.382]  And whoever got kicked out... Lesbian women that just wanted to hear a controversial speech!
[03:12:06.743 --> 03:12:09.246]  Like I remember in college, I would go hear the Black Panther...
[03:12:11.349 --> 03:12:15.953]  I would go hear the Black Panthers speak.
[03:12:15.993 --> 03:12:17.775]  I would go protest the KKK.
[03:12:17.815 --> 03:12:20.117]  I could have got beat up because I was white going to it.
[03:12:20.537 --> 03:12:24.901]  I mean, it's like, since when does the left not let controversial speakers speak?
[03:12:24.941 --> 03:12:26.022]  And then you're not even controversial.
[03:12:26.343 --> 03:12:28.044]  They're controversial that they don't like you.
[03:12:28.324 --> 03:12:33.129]  Well, the left and George Soros are taking advantage of the situation with the Millennials right now.
[03:12:33.769 --> 03:12:37.853]  The Millennials are very confused generationally.
[03:12:37.993 --> 03:12:39.854]  They have had a lot of problems.
[03:12:39.894 --> 03:12:41.996]  They've got massive amounts of student debt.
[03:12:42.477 --> 03:12:47.701]  They've got a situation where their employment does not pay for their living.
[03:12:47.741 --> 03:12:49.323]  They can't pay off their student debt.
[03:12:49.563 --> 03:12:51.064]  So they're struggling.
[03:12:51.084 --> 03:12:52.706]  You see that was like yesterday or something, right?
[03:12:52.726 --> 03:12:56.229]  The dirty secret of the entire Millennial generation.
[03:12:56.909 --> 03:12:59.131]  Their parents are paying for their living.
[03:12:59.191 --> 03:13:00.432]  Millie just said it all, though.
[03:13:00.452 --> 03:13:01.072]  That's the key.
[03:13:01.152 --> 03:13:16.444]  They're struggling, and so what's happening is, meanwhile, the millennials are going to these universities where the professors that are being hired are Marxist professors, telling them that the reason why they're struggling is because of capitalism, not because the Democrats have ruined everything and been corrupt.
[03:13:16.804 --> 03:13:17.865]  It's Cloward and Pivot.
[03:13:18.165 --> 03:13:26.132]  They admit they're giving them obsolete degrees on purpose to make them a revolutionary pissed-off force, mad at the only system that can save them, provenly.
[03:13:26.493 --> 03:13:29.435]  And exactly, because they can't just screw people up.
[03:13:29.495 --> 03:13:32.698]  They've got to screw them up and then point them at somebody who's the enemy.
[03:13:33.078 --> 03:13:47.463]  What upsets me about it is that, you know, to take the culture war and the political war stuff out of it, although I understand that that's the driving, you know, the prime mover behind what the left is doing, what upsets me about it is going to university is supposed to be a time of joyfulness.
[03:13:47.483 --> 03:13:58.406]  It's supposed to be a time of broadening horizons, when you explore your sexuality, where you explore your intellectual, you know, capacity, find out what you're capable of, read, watch, learn, discover things.
[03:13:59.166 --> 03:14:03.208]  And, you know, come to view the world and other people in a way you never thought possible.
[03:14:03.248 --> 03:14:04.728]  Learn more about yourself, all the rest of it.
[03:14:05.008 --> 03:14:09.470]  Well, taking the joy out of the subjects and policing, you know, student sexuality.
[03:14:09.510 --> 03:14:11.390]  They are killing Western civilization.
[03:14:11.410 --> 03:14:12.531]  That's right.
[03:14:12.551 --> 03:14:13.671]  They are liberal killers.
[03:14:13.951 --> 03:14:21.414]  Because the university and true open thought is liberalism, and they are literally liberal killers telling you they're liberal like the body snatcher.
[03:14:21.534 --> 03:14:24.475]  They're strangling Lady Liberty to death, going, I'm the liberal!
[03:14:24.495 --> 03:14:25.395]  I run everything!
[03:14:25.555 --> 03:14:26.256]  Watch what you say!
[03:14:26.276 --> 03:14:26.876]  I'm the boss!
[03:14:27.356 --> 03:14:27.776]  That's right.
[03:14:27.796 --> 03:14:28.116]  It's true.
[03:14:28.216 --> 03:14:44.382]  It's so bad that even a Facebook page has been created called Film Your Marxist Professors where college students are submitting their film footage and these professors are literally speaking saying we need communism and talking about all that weird gender identity, genderbender stuff.
[03:14:44.522 --> 03:14:53.675]  What they've done in the liberal arts is they've replaced the study of the actual subject, whether it's art or literature or music or history, with a system of criticism about the subject.
[03:14:53.695 --> 03:14:55.938]  So rather than looking at the original text, what does this mean?
[03:14:55.958 --> 03:14:56.459]  What does this say?
[03:14:56.519 --> 03:14:57.981]  How does this teach us about the world around us?
[03:14:58.302 --> 03:15:00.185]  What does it say about freedom, about personal responsibility?
[03:15:00.205 --> 03:15:01.046]  There's no critical thinking!
[03:15:01.286 --> 03:15:07.328]  Well, they've replaced that with a sort of thin critique, all based on social justice, which is just cultural Marxism.
[03:15:07.388 --> 03:15:12.290]  It's a thin critique, then with an orthodoxy of a cult you must follow.
[03:15:12.490 --> 03:15:25.474]  Right, but they've taken the wonder of exploration in university and the open possibilities out and replaced it with a dogmatic system of politics through which... So they're not really liberals, they use communism for control.
[03:15:25.514 --> 03:15:27.675]  What they are is really evil social engineers.
[03:15:28.215 --> 03:15:28.755]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:15:28.996 --> 03:15:29.376]  Absolutely.
[03:15:29.436 --> 03:15:34.138]  And you know, I've spent as much time on American college campuses in the last two years as perhaps anyone else in the country.
[03:15:35.059 --> 03:15:36.759]  And what you're saying is absolutely right.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:39.501]  If I try to walk on them, it's like the Body Snatcher movie.
[03:15:39.521 --> 03:15:45.504]  They literally just go... They get triggered.
[03:15:45.524 --> 03:15:48.505]  Next time I come down, we should take a little trip to UT Austin for sure.
[03:15:49.426 --> 03:15:49.826]  Absolutely.
[03:15:49.866 --> 03:15:50.926]  I wish you weren't leaving today.
[03:15:51.527 --> 03:15:54.308]  We'll be back to get to this other report where the left takes over.
[03:15:54.328 --> 03:15:55.889]  They create giant crap holes.
[03:15:58.618 --> 03:16:08.642]  I don't want to just sit here and give you the standard pitch for our new product bodies, which is the ultimate turmeric formula out there on the market from our deep research.
[03:16:08.662 --> 03:16:19.447]  The purity, the concentration, the quality, and the other synergistic organic compounds that are added to it so that it's bioavailable and gets into your bloodstream.
[03:16:20.627 --> 03:16:24.429]  I've got a big list of the facts here, and I guess I'll go over some of it for you.
[03:16:25.209 --> 03:16:26.250]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:16:27.441 --> 03:16:32.242]  Talking to Paul Watson about two years ago, I said, which of the products do you use and like the most?
[03:16:32.842 --> 03:16:35.743]  And he said, listen, what I really want is a turmeric product.
[03:16:36.563 --> 03:16:37.764]  He goes, you've seen the studies.
[03:16:37.784 --> 03:16:38.724]  You know what it does.
[03:16:39.164 --> 03:16:40.404]  You know what it's been proven to do.
[03:16:40.484 --> 03:16:41.204]  It's crazy.
[03:16:42.185 --> 03:16:46.326]  And I've read a lot of them out there are adulterated or watered down.
[03:16:46.346 --> 03:16:47.386]  I said, well, let me look into it.
[03:16:47.606 --> 03:16:53.688]  And so it then took us off and on several years to finally come out with this because I
[03:16:55.529 --> 03:16:58.634]  I want to bring you the very best product we can get.
[03:16:59.655 --> 03:17:02.539]  I want it to be what myself and my family take.
[03:17:03.681 --> 03:17:04.262]  And we've done it.
[03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:20.263]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years for its known therapeutic effects and is the subject of well over 10,000 published scientific articles and studies.
[03:17:20.483 --> 03:17:27.265]  Plain turmeric root contains on average about 3% of the active ingredient, the curcuminoids.
[03:17:27.845 --> 03:17:35.049]  But our powerful blend contains turmeric extract containing 95% curcuminoids.
[03:17:35.549 --> 03:17:37.050]  Did you hear what I'm saying?
[03:17:38.271 --> 03:17:41.853]  Most of the brands out there are at 3% or less and are adulterated.
[03:17:42.313 --> 03:17:43.674]  This is 95%.
[03:17:45.595 --> 03:17:49.797]  Body Ease Ultimate Turmeric Formula is also fortified with pepperine.
[03:17:50.922 --> 03:17:57.506]  Pepparine, many studies have shown, helps accelerate the absorption of the tumeric compounds, the curcuminoids, in the body.
[03:17:57.946 --> 03:18:00.067]  Now let's get to Boswellia.
[03:18:00.627 --> 03:18:06.110]  Boswellia is an ayurvedic herb that has been studied for its anti-inflammatory properties.
[03:18:06.631 --> 03:18:14.455]  In fact, the active ingredient, boswellic acid, has been shown in studies to inhibit one of the enzymes that actually cause the inflammation response.
[03:18:14.675 --> 03:18:19.938]  BodyEase also contains the organic herbs, spirum, sage, lemon balm, and thyme.
[03:18:20.698 --> 03:18:27.484]  As an added bonus, all of the ingredients we just listed contain very potent antioxidants.
[03:18:27.784 --> 03:18:36.352]  In fact, turmeric's curcuminoids are some of the most potent and naturally occurring free radical scavenging antioxidants available on the market.
[03:18:36.632 --> 03:18:39.175]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go to mfulworthstore.com.
[03:18:39.815 --> 03:18:44.137]  And go to the body's page, you can actually see the video the TV viewers can see right now.
[03:18:44.677 --> 03:18:48.919]  If you look at our turmeric product, it's bright yellow-orange, the way it's supposed to be.
[03:18:49.199 --> 03:18:53.701]  That's because the active compound in curcuminoids is orange.
[03:18:54.302 --> 03:19:02.766]  So again, it's not just the concentration, it's not just the studies we've done, it's not just the test, it's how vibrant and bright our product is.
[03:19:03.126 --> 03:19:05.527]  The recommended MSRP is $59.95 and it's a great deal.
[03:19:07.888 --> 03:19:09.449]  Because of the quality and concentration.
[03:19:09.869 --> 03:19:18.453]  But out of the gates, we're offering bodies for 50% off, 29.95, infowarestore.com.

[03:19:23.095 --> 03:19:31.899]  And at the same time, you know you're funding the information war that is battling against the globalists and trying to restore not just our republic, but freedom worldwide.
[03:19:32.379 --> 03:19:33.040]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:19:34.227 --> 03:19:35.789]  I am so excited about bodies.
[03:19:36.529 --> 03:19:37.930]  I hope you will try it for yourself.
[03:19:38.511 --> 03:19:46.618]  It's exclusively available right now, out of the gates, 50% off at InfoWareStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:19:47.679 --> 03:19:53.444]  This is the ultimate turmeric product on the market from our research.
[03:19:53.785 --> 03:19:56.487]  It's at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[03:20:02.484 --> 03:20:05.080]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.178 --> 03:20:29.979]  All right, Alex Jones here back live with Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:20:30.019 --> 03:20:30.900]  Doesn't need any introduction.
[03:20:30.920 --> 03:20:33.040]  Of course, Millie Weaver, our great reporter, coming up.
[03:20:33.080 --> 03:20:34.721]  Joel Gilbert will host the last 30 minutes.
[03:20:34.781 --> 03:20:36.081]  And the War Room's coming back up.
[03:20:36.522 --> 03:20:37.662]  And Milo's a hard-working guy.
[03:20:37.682 --> 03:20:40.223]  He's going to be back in there with our own Owen Schroer.
[03:20:40.643 --> 03:20:44.464]  But since we mentioned this, Millie and Milo were bringing this up during the break.
[03:20:44.504 --> 03:20:45.965]  I went and pulled the articles up with the crew.
[03:20:47.363 --> 03:21:04.880]  We're talking about how we're being colonized by Antifa in Austin and they'll have like an apartment and a trust fund, sometimes they're worth millions of dollars we've discovered, but they live four or five days a week homeless in these camps to do photo ops and to try to control the poor people and try to create a climate of cloward and pivot to bring things down.
[03:21:05.180 --> 03:21:05.861]  There's the Atlantic.
[03:21:05.961 --> 03:21:06.822]  Homeless by choice.
[03:21:07.142 --> 03:21:08.502]  How to live in America for free.
[03:21:08.922 --> 03:21:11.223]  But again, it's to only hurt the capitalist system.
[03:21:11.643 --> 03:21:13.643]  What it's like to be voluntarily homeless.
[03:21:13.943 --> 03:21:25.485]  And this ties into your report on InfoWars.com, how Democrats create American you-know-what holes, and then how they exploit them and how they bulldoze them.
[03:21:25.525 --> 03:21:30.306]  You were both very eloquently ranting about how this is a program of control.
[03:21:30.586 --> 03:21:32.166]  They do this on purpose.
[03:21:32.507 --> 03:21:34.847]  Dems' policies create huge crap holes.
[03:21:35.327 --> 03:21:37.267]  They first exploit, then bulldoze.
[03:21:37.668 --> 03:21:40.568]  What is the master plan as California does this?
[03:21:40.788 --> 03:21:55.752]  Well, it seems like Agenda 21 to me, because when you have the Democrats offering aid to refugees and illegal immigrants, but neglecting American citizens, most of the people living in these tent cities in California are Americans and they actually do have jobs, believe it or not.
[03:21:56.072 --> 03:22:01.313]  And yes, there has been a large influx of younger millennials at these camps doing drugs and whatever else.
[03:22:01.633 --> 03:22:04.935]  But a large portion are just hard-working people that want to get out of the hole.
[03:22:04.955 --> 03:22:15.602]  The problem is, is the cost of living in California is so high, you'd have to make around, they said, $8,000 a month to be able to afford the median rent-asking price.
[03:22:15.862 --> 03:22:16.762]  So that's a lot of money.
[03:22:17.003 --> 03:22:25.988]  And I notice most of these are old carpenters and veterans that are mainly white, or Hispanic, or black, and then you've got all the rich millennial white kids partying in there.
[03:22:26.008 --> 03:22:30.271]  This is the most amazing phenomenon of the decade, the hipster homeless.
[03:22:30.908 --> 03:22:34.750]  It's like hipster hobos or something.
[03:22:34.810 --> 03:22:35.210]  I don't know.
[03:22:35.430 --> 03:22:40.653]  I would say that there are a lot of hipster hobos and those are the younger ones that want to just do drugs and there's no rules.
[03:22:40.693 --> 03:22:42.794]  That's literally what the homeless people say there.
[03:22:42.834 --> 03:22:47.496]  But then you've got all these old, hard-working, displaced handymen.
[03:22:47.516 --> 03:22:53.259]  But it's easy to opt out of society when you have a penthouse to go home to or you could call your dad if you get into trouble.
[03:22:54.180 --> 03:22:54.780]  That's my point.
[03:22:54.820 --> 03:22:56.061]  I want to talk about them.
[03:22:56.121 --> 03:22:57.462]  Because your video gets into all of them.
[03:22:57.502 --> 03:22:57.943]  It's powerful.
[03:22:57.963 --> 03:22:58.563]  People should see it.
[03:22:58.783 --> 03:23:00.024]  How the left creates crap holes.
[03:23:00.124 --> 03:23:01.205]  That's a separate issue.
[03:23:01.225 --> 03:23:02.166]  Why do they create crap holes?
[03:23:02.186 --> 03:23:02.967]  That's the second question.
[03:23:03.307 --> 03:23:10.693]  I'm asking, why do, when I go out and see this, Antifa gets you $100,000 vehicles that I don't have?
[03:23:10.733 --> 03:23:12.534]  You know, I'm driving a $60,000 Ford truck.
[03:23:12.554 --> 03:23:13.295]  And by the way, I love it.
[03:23:13.315 --> 03:23:13.836]  It's awesome.
[03:23:14.136 --> 03:23:14.836]  I'm not complaining.
[03:23:15.517 --> 03:23:16.538]  And then they're rich.
[03:23:16.698 --> 03:23:18.299]  And then they're bitching about America.
[03:23:18.359 --> 03:23:19.040]  It's crazy.
[03:23:20.031 --> 03:23:26.035]  Yeah, well these are the people who have benefited from this sort of corrupt late period capitalism.
[03:23:26.095 --> 03:23:29.857]  Multinational corporations in bed with multinational government organizations and all the rest of it.
[03:23:29.877 --> 03:23:43.245]  They're benefiting from the fruits of this late nepotistic, elitist, corrupt version of capitalism and deciding, because they can, because they can afford to, to opt out of it as a sort of lifestyle.
[03:23:43.405 --> 03:23:48.527]  There are a lot of millennials opting out where they'll just like convert their vans out and live on the road.
[03:23:48.547 --> 03:23:49.508]  They think it's trendy.
[03:23:49.828 --> 03:23:50.708]  So I have seen that.
[03:23:50.748 --> 03:23:52.929]  I think there's a lot of Antifa jumping on this thing.
[03:23:52.949 --> 03:24:00.452]  Well they say, I don't want to be part of society, but they couldn't go to Venezuela or Cuba or... Well they wouldn't go anywhere actually communist.
[03:24:00.472 --> 03:24:02.553]  Because they'll kill you in two seconds for doing that.
[03:24:02.573 --> 03:24:11.536]  They want to opt into a socialist lifestyle within a safe capitalist democracy because that's the way you have your cake and eat it.
[03:24:11.556 --> 03:24:12.917]  So where do you see this going Milo?
[03:24:15.579 --> 03:24:20.482]  I would have liked to imagine this was just some crazy brief youth movement, but we know that it isn't.
[03:24:20.842 --> 03:24:25.486]  We know that the Millennials are the first generation who aren't growing out of their youthful socialist indiscretions.
[03:24:25.766 --> 03:24:29.769]  They're staying bitter, miserable, and deranged well into their later years.
[03:24:33.271 --> 03:24:37.956]  Or 54% in one poll I saw say they want communism, want to bring down capitalist systems.
[03:24:38.256 --> 03:24:49.268]  This is like people out on a beautiful ship on the ocean, doing great, having a great time, and there's a horrible rotting thing, there's a horrible rotting lifeboat, and they say, we want to sink this ship and get in the lifeboat.
[03:24:49.468 --> 03:25:02.454]  But we're failing to recognize here the fact that a lot of these homeless people living in California actually are working hard working Americans and the fact that the Democrats have created this problem reaction solution.
[03:25:02.794 --> 03:25:04.995]  This is why Trump says America first.
[03:25:05.336 --> 03:25:09.498]  We're housing and helping our refugees and illegal immigrants.
[03:25:09.518 --> 03:25:10.398]  They're not taking care of our veterans.
[03:25:10.418 --> 03:25:12.840]  I think our Americans, a lot of these people are our veterans.
[03:25:12.860 --> 03:25:18.084]  So when Trump's saying, America first, America first, it's not because he doesn't want to help, necessarily.
[03:25:18.124 --> 03:25:20.806]  Bringing down America lets the globalists take over.
[03:25:20.886 --> 03:25:21.447]  He knows that.
[03:25:21.787 --> 03:25:24.209]  Bringing us down to a lower level doesn't help the third world.
[03:25:24.249 --> 03:25:24.829]  And Millie, you're right.
[03:25:25.149 --> 03:25:26.290]  Those are separate issues.
[03:25:26.310 --> 03:25:28.232]  Your report gets into all of that.
[03:25:28.332 --> 03:25:29.052]  That's the question.
[03:25:29.193 --> 03:25:31.975]  Why does the left create hell holes knowingly?
[03:25:32.657 --> 03:25:40.561]  Well this is what we would, you know, sometimes when you on the show use words like demonic and satanic, and we referred to this earlier on, this is what we're talking about.
[03:25:40.581 --> 03:26:00.392]  This sort of, this otherworldly cruelty hypocrisy, this Twilight Zone aspect to Democrats and modern leftist politicians who are able with a straight face to say that it is a good thing there are veterans homeless on the streets barely able to feed themselves having to do, you know, jobs around the edges for cash while they're advocating for
[03:26:00.592 --> 03:26:02.033]  So where does it all end, Millie, and then Milo?
[03:26:02.053 --> 03:26:03.274]  Because I want to get to these points.
[03:26:03.314 --> 03:26:04.815]  I got one more here, too.
[03:26:04.895 --> 03:26:10.398]  Well, essentially, it's going to continue to get worse as long as California continues to be a Democratic state.
[03:26:10.418 --> 03:26:16.621]  There used to be a time when California was a Republican state, believe it or not, and they didn't have this massive homeless crisis.
[03:26:16.762 --> 03:26:22.265]  Every time you turn the state blue, massive homelessness, unemployment, problems.
[03:26:22.645 --> 03:26:23.305]  We're good to go.
[03:26:43.567 --> 03:26:52.963]  We know there's evil controllers and there's minions, but what percentage, Milo, do you think of leftists actually know they're consciously pushing an evil system and they just want control of the wreck they create?
[03:26:53.914 --> 03:26:58.238]  As I get older, I get more cynical as I learn and read and discover more.
[03:26:58.418 --> 03:26:59.059]  Me too.
[03:26:59.099 --> 03:27:02.522]  The percentage of people I think are doing it on purpose gets larger.
[03:27:03.202 --> 03:27:11.890]  And now I think it's like 50% pure evil and 50% just abject stupidity, selfishness and hypocrisy.
[03:27:12.570 --> 03:27:16.534]  It's like Gruber saying, thank God Americans are so dumb and don't pay attention.
[03:27:17.335 --> 03:27:18.095]  They want that.
[03:27:19.476 --> 03:27:24.797]  But I think, in closing, and then we're going to be back on the podcast, we're back in the war room, and Millie's got a report on 4Wars.com.
[03:27:25.197 --> 03:27:25.937]  It's a great report.
[03:27:27.198 --> 03:27:28.618]  I just have a gut feeling we're going to win.
[03:27:28.658 --> 03:27:30.438]  I mean, why wouldn't humanity want prosperity?
[03:27:30.658 --> 03:27:32.539]  Are we really going to be run by a bunch of Bernie Sanders?
[03:27:33.459 --> 03:27:41.601]  Well, you have a lot of liberals right now that I talk to in California that are aware of this homeless crisis, and they're mad at the Democrat politicians.
[03:27:41.621 --> 03:27:44.181]  They're mad at Governor Jerry Brown.
[03:27:44.301 --> 03:27:45.721]  They're mad at Maxine Waters.
[03:27:45.961 --> 03:27:48.822]  They see that these people are failing to do their job.
[03:27:49.142 --> 03:27:53.888]  And so I think it's important to point out, hey, this is because of Democratic policies.
[03:27:53.968 --> 03:28:04.482]  And when these guys are hypocritically saying to Trump, oh, you call these other foreign countries S-H-I-T-H-O-L-S, well, meanwhile, they have one in their backyard that they're failing to address.
[03:28:04.502 --> 03:28:06.986]  And that's why do they create giant open-air sewers?
[03:28:08.367 --> 03:28:14.152]  No, they preside over them, and they perpetuate them, and they have a vested interest in keeping these areas like this.
[03:28:14.192 --> 03:28:14.993]  So that's it.
[03:28:15.033 --> 03:28:18.196]  The left are craphole rulers.
[03:28:18.356 --> 03:28:21.198]  They are lords of the shithole.
[03:28:21.278 --> 03:28:23.060]  There are Mugabes.
[03:28:23.140 --> 03:28:31.928]  I mean, they're people who have a vested interest in staying in, you know, rarefied, walled communities while they preside over declined chaos and inhumanity.
[03:28:32.468 --> 03:28:41.872]  They're spending more money to treat the homeless problem as a police problem by arresting them and letting them go, arresting them and letting them go, than actually just getting the social programs out there to help them out of it.
[03:28:41.952 --> 03:28:43.392]  It's like they want... They're pure evil.
[03:28:43.472 --> 03:28:45.233]  Milly, your report's on Infowars.com.
[03:28:45.313 --> 03:28:47.274]  Milo, a dangerous tour.
[03:28:47.354 --> 03:28:51.756]  We'll be back with another great reporter on the other side.
[03:28:51.896 --> 03:28:54.917]  Joel Gilbert and Milo will be back on The War Room, coming up.
[03:28:54.937 --> 03:28:55.357]  Stay with us.
[03:28:57.915 --> 03:29:05.601]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going to those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:29:06.461 --> 03:29:10.525]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:29:11.025 --> 03:29:13.367]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:29:14.167 --> 03:29:17.290]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:29:18.792 --> 03:29:30.917]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[03:29:31.617 --> 03:29:46.684]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[03:29:47.684 --> 03:29:51.387]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for you and your family.
[03:29:51.947 --> 03:29:53.648]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:29:53.688 --> 03:29:56.530]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[03:29:57.971 --> 03:30:02.814]  I have promoted and sold hundreds of great products in my 22 years on air.
[03:30:03.554 --> 03:30:06.917]  But this one right here is in the top three.
[03:30:07.337 --> 03:30:08.458]  Alexa Pure Breeze.
[03:30:08.778 --> 03:30:12.520]  You can buy filters similar to this one for $500 to $600 that are three-stage.
[03:30:16.744 --> 03:30:36.052]  Alexa Pure Breeze is $200, has a four-filter system, including ion, cluster, charcoal, and more, that is completely game-changing and costs less than half of leading competitors.
[03:30:36.972 --> 03:30:38.413]  And when you look at the specs,
[03:30:39.508 --> 03:30:40.408]  It's just amazing.
[03:30:40.528 --> 03:30:49.453]  When you first turn it on in a room, it's red, meaning it's picking up particulate, it's picking up pathogens, it's picking up gases, it's picking up toxins.
[03:30:49.853 --> 03:30:55.995]  And it might take 10 minutes, it might take an hour for it to turn pink and then blue when it's picking nothing up.
[03:30:56.076 --> 03:30:57.076]  And these are so strong.
[03:30:57.456 --> 03:31:00.257]  In my home, if I sneeze 20 feet away,
[03:31:01.798 --> 03:31:04.460]  In a few seconds, it goes from blue to red.
[03:31:04.820 --> 03:31:06.181]  It's picking up that particular.
[03:31:06.742 --> 03:31:15.788]  That's what's so amazing about this unit is the sensors are so strong and the four filtration systems are so compact but so powerful.
[03:31:15.928 --> 03:31:19.290]  Could you spend way more and get something that maybe has a little bit better specs?
[03:31:19.370 --> 03:31:19.571]  Yes.
[03:31:20.191 --> 03:31:25.454]  But there are a lot of filters out there that are $500, $600, $700 that aren't even as good.
[03:31:25.734 --> 03:31:29.616]  And again, these can go six months to a year, depending on how dirty the environment is.
[03:31:30.076 --> 03:31:32.458]  The replacement filters are very, very inexpensive.
[03:31:32.978 --> 03:31:40.682]  Do yourself a favor and go to InfowarsStore.com today, read the specs for yourself, and then you have nothing to lose.
[03:31:41.102 --> 03:31:41.402]  Spend $200.
[03:31:42.663 --> 03:31:45.326]  Help us make $50 to fund our operation.
[03:31:45.686 --> 03:31:47.868]  Get an amazing unit in your home.
[03:31:48.148 --> 03:31:55.755]  I'm very confident that we're going to see you come back and order several more and then a few more for your office and then to give them as gifts as well.
[03:31:56.036 --> 03:31:59.199]  There are studies, and listen to me carefully, all over the world
[03:32:00.194 --> 03:32:13.461]  And depending on the study, it's between 7 and 12 years that the average person loses off their life expectancy living in a big city alone because of the toxins and the particulates.
[03:32:13.781 --> 03:32:16.162]  You then add all the pollen and the rest of it.
[03:32:17.162 --> 03:32:25.347]  It is not a luxury to have the Alexa Pure Breeze that is the best filtration system out there at the lowest price.
[03:32:26.447 --> 03:32:27.968]  It is essential.
[03:32:29.406 --> 03:32:35.607]  We are doing everything we can to mitigate the toxic environment that industrial society has created.
[03:32:35.847 --> 03:32:37.067]  So support the InfoWarp.
[03:32:37.507 --> 03:32:45.309]  Fund folks that are fighting the globalists and having success, and get a system that purifies and cleans the air for yourself and your family.
[03:32:45.569 --> 03:32:48.149]  It's the Alexa Pure Breeze at InfoWarpStore.com.
[03:32:48.389 --> 03:32:53.690]  We also have their full line of amazing gravity-fed filters as well, which are a huge home run.
[03:32:54.010 --> 03:32:57.391]  But this, this is a grand slam.
[03:33:02.009 --> 03:33:04.812]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.633 --> 03:33:15.242]  We are on the march.
[03:33:15.563 --> 03:33:17.805]  The Empire is on the run.
[03:33:18.726 --> 03:33:22.450]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:28.081 --> 03:33:34.725]  Hello everyone, I'm Joel Gilbert, coming to you right from the left coast, hosting the Alex Jones Show for the next two segments.
[03:33:35.646 --> 03:33:48.494]  You probably know me from my films, Dreams from My Real Father, There's No Place Like Utopia, and my new film, which we'll talk about later, this is in the Alex Jones Store, The Art of the Insult, Trump, The Art of the Insult.
[03:33:48.534 --> 03:33:51.776]  Please go to the Alex Jones Store and check out, buy this DVD.
[03:33:52.771 --> 03:34:01.934]  I want to talk to you about some interesting things in the news and what's going on with, first of all, with the dossier that is in the news every day.
[03:34:03.654 --> 03:34:20.139]  Among the few givens in this unfolding drama of the alleged Russia-Trump collusion is that former MI6 intelligence officer Christopher Steele wrote the Donald Trump-Russia dossier, and it's actually known as the Steele dossier.
[03:34:22.503 --> 03:34:24.224]  I looked into this guy, Christopher Steele.
[03:34:24.504 --> 03:34:25.665]  He's former MI6.
[03:34:25.785 --> 03:34:32.669]  He had not been to Russia since 1992, so he certainly didn't have any current contacts.
[03:34:33.530 --> 03:34:47.199]  I also found out that Christopher Steele was a left-wing student, far left, at Cambridge University, where he also wrote for the Varsity, and he was in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the CND.
[03:34:47.839 --> 03:34:50.761]  It was a British organization that was particularly active
[03:34:51.926 --> 03:35:01.154]  In the early 1980s, when Steele was at Cambridge University, actually MI5 monitored CND because of the reported communist ties.
[03:35:01.755 --> 03:35:10.522]  So here we have a guy, Christopher Steele, who was involved in Soviet propaganda, of Soviet propaganda organization in the 80s.
[03:35:11.543 --> 03:35:17.829]  Now, by the way, at that very same time, 1983, Barack Obama was at Columbia University.
[03:35:18.749 --> 03:35:26.695]  And in his senior year, he wrote an article in the Sundial, the Columbia University magazine, called Breaking the War Mentality.
[03:35:27.455 --> 03:35:30.738]  Now, this article was the same Soviet propaganda.
[03:35:30.858 --> 03:35:43.187]  It simply went that if Americans would simply stop their warmongering and stop this lust for war, that peace would break out, that the Soviet Union was an innocent actor.
[03:35:44.153 --> 03:35:46.295]  Well, the United States was guilty of warmongering.
[03:35:46.675 --> 03:35:54.720]  And Barack Obama wrote this article, you know, called Breaking the War Mentality, echoing the Soviet propaganda of the time.
[03:35:55.220 --> 03:35:56.421]  Now, this was very similar.
[03:35:56.561 --> 03:36:06.328]  If you saw my film, Dreams to My Real Father, Obama's real biological father, Frank Marshall Davis, was a Soviet agent and a Communist Party propagandist.
[03:36:07.148 --> 03:36:10.671]  And he wrote an article back in the Cold War called U.S.
[03:36:10.731 --> 03:36:12.112]  Greatest Obstacle to Peace.
[03:36:13.115 --> 03:36:24.540]  So Obama is pretty much following in the footsteps as a red diaper baby, writing the same type of thing that the United States is guilty and the United States is the problem and that's why we don't have peace.
[03:36:25.240 --> 03:36:29.361]  Christopher Steele, of course, same type of background.
[03:36:29.421 --> 03:36:35.324]  He's going to Cambridge University supporting the campaign for nuclear disarmament.
[03:36:36.124 --> 03:36:37.985]  So about a week and a half ago,
[03:36:39.145 --> 03:36:42.047]  I decided to read the dossier.
[03:36:42.067 --> 03:36:42.988]  I had not done so.
[03:36:43.989 --> 03:36:44.650]  It's online.
[03:36:45.490 --> 03:36:49.654]  And as soon as I read it, I couldn't believe what I realized.
[03:36:50.394 --> 03:36:54.317]  It was so obvious that this dossier was written by a non-English speaker.
[03:36:55.218 --> 03:36:58.861]  English was not the first language of the author of the Steele dossier.
[03:36:58.901 --> 03:37:02.144]  In fact, it was quite obvious it was written by a Russian.
[03:37:02.904 --> 03:37:06.387]  And I was shocked that the media had not taken time to look at it.
[03:37:06.447 --> 03:37:08.509]  I was shocked that I didn't take time to look at it.
[03:37:09.369 --> 03:37:12.091]  So, I decided to call my friend Jack Cashill.
[03:37:12.771 --> 03:37:22.296]  Now, he's the one that examined the language of Barack Obama's biography, Dreams for My Father, and he discovered immediately, he said, wait a minute, this was not written by Barack Obama.
[03:37:23.077 --> 03:37:28.560]  And he realized it was the same language and style used by Bill Ayers, terrorist emeritus Bill Ayers.
[03:37:29.457 --> 03:37:38.864]  Who we'll talk about later, who everybody knows was in the weather underground and was part of the revolutionary movement to overthrow the United States in the late 60s.
[03:37:39.664 --> 03:37:40.485]  Open revolution.
[03:37:40.685 --> 03:37:43.827]  It was not an anti-war, anti-Vietnam protest movement.
[03:37:44.408 --> 03:37:48.171]  And Barack Obama obviously was very close to this guy such that he wrote his book.
[03:37:49.071 --> 03:37:56.397]  So Jack Cashel and I decided to dissect the Steele dossier and we came up with this article called
[03:37:57.463 --> 03:38:03.287]  We said, did Christopher Steele write his dossier or did a Russian associate that came out an American thinker?
[03:38:04.547 --> 03:38:09.770]  Now, I'd like everyone to definitely after this, after InfoWars, go and read the dossier.
[03:38:10.491 --> 03:38:12.072]  The English is a total mess.
[03:38:12.632 --> 03:38:13.953]  The punctuation is wrong.
[03:38:14.894 --> 03:38:16.114]  The article is missing.
[03:38:16.254 --> 03:38:17.075]  I'll give you an example.
[03:38:18.836 --> 03:38:21.958]  To encourage splits and divisions in Western alliance.
[03:38:22.842 --> 03:38:24.103]  The word the is missing.
[03:38:24.143 --> 03:38:28.004]  It should be to encourage splits and divisions in the Western Alliance.
[03:38:28.044 --> 03:38:30.765]  A very typical Russian language mistake.
[03:38:31.725 --> 03:38:35.107]  The word however is used throughout the dossier.
[03:38:35.127 --> 03:38:38.528]  Sometimes there's a comma after it where there should be, sometimes not.
[03:38:40.849 --> 03:38:43.450]  Also the words countries and families.
[03:38:45.651 --> 03:38:50.132]  The problem is when they use this, they use the wrong spelling and the wrong possessive.
[03:38:50.593 --> 03:38:51.373]  It's a total mess.
[03:38:52.205 --> 03:38:55.306]  Repeating certain mistakes, you can see that it's a non-native English speaker.
[03:38:55.946 --> 03:39:01.667]  I'll read you one sentence from the dossier that you can just listen to me and imagine I'm speaking with a Russian accent.
[03:39:02.767 --> 03:39:07.068]  Trump's previous efforts had included exploring the real estate sector in St.
[03:39:07.108 --> 03:39:17.530]  Petersburg as well as Moscow, but in the end, Trump had to settle for the use of extensive sexual services there from local prostitutes rather than business success.
[03:39:18.777 --> 03:39:21.818]  Now, this is a very awkward, butchered sentence.
[03:39:21.838 --> 03:39:29.282]  There's no way this was written by an English speaker, no less Chris Steele, who was a writer and journalist way back in college.
[03:39:30.142 --> 03:39:44.069]  Later on in the dossier, the reader is told the Trump campaign leaked the DNC documents to WikiLeaks to, quote, swing supporters of Bernie Sanders away from Hillary Clinton and across to Trump.
[03:39:45.143 --> 03:39:47.445]  Now, the word across is completely wrong.
[03:39:47.865 --> 03:39:48.906]  The whole thing is awkward.
[03:39:50.147 --> 03:39:55.391]  Then, out of nowhere, at the end of the dossier, they jam in these Democrat talking points.
[03:39:55.751 --> 03:40:03.657]  And I'm quoting again, Moscow's interference in the US presidential election campaign shows that Trump is unfit for office.
[03:40:04.837 --> 03:40:11.302]  Now, Hillary and Obama used this terminology during the campaign, so you have Democrat talking points in this dossier.
[03:40:11.963 --> 03:40:12.123]  Now,
[03:40:12.913 --> 03:40:17.514]  I sent this dossier to a friend of mine, Konstantin Prebogensky.
[03:40:17.554 --> 03:40:19.935]  He was in one of my films, There's No Place Like Utopia.
[03:40:20.635 --> 03:40:23.176]  He's a KGB spy who defected to the United States.
[03:40:23.896 --> 03:40:25.256]  And I asked him to read the dossier.
[03:40:26.477 --> 03:40:29.917]  And he didn't want to comment about the language because English is not his first language.
[03:40:30.478 --> 03:40:33.358]  But this is what he told me about the dossier.
[03:40:34.019 --> 03:40:37.259]  He said, there is no information in the dossier whatsoever.
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:39.260]  It's just foolish speculation.
[03:40:39.921 --> 03:40:41.002]  There are no references.
[03:40:41.502 --> 03:40:43.863]  It's not an intelligence document of any kind.
[03:40:44.643 --> 03:40:46.784]  I was laughing when I was reading it.
[03:40:47.264 --> 03:40:49.265]  Now, this is from a former KGB agent.
[03:40:50.106 --> 03:40:55.528]  So, Jack Cashill and I, you know, we took one look at this and we wrote this article.
[03:40:55.989 --> 03:40:58.430]  And this is something that the media has to look at.
[03:40:58.670 --> 03:41:08.514]  And it's shocking that any FBI agent or the FISA court, anybody that read this document would see it was written by a Russian and not an American.
[03:41:10.239 --> 03:41:13.441]  Let me also comment about the people involved in this dossier.
[03:41:14.582 --> 03:41:17.404]  Nellie Orr has gotten a lot of publicity lately.
[03:41:17.444 --> 03:41:20.826]  She's someone that was a Russia expert and Russian language speaker.
[03:41:21.386 --> 03:41:23.047]  She was hired by Fusion GPS.
[03:41:23.528 --> 03:41:29.051]  Now, very conveniently, her husband, Bruce Orr, worked for the DOJ.
[03:41:29.252 --> 03:41:32.173]  Now, coincidentally, I went to high school with Bruce Orr.
[03:41:32.814 --> 03:41:34.555]  And Bruce was into physics.
[03:41:35.155 --> 03:41:36.336]  He wanted to be a physicist.
[03:41:36.376 --> 03:41:37.477]  He was not into politics.
[03:41:38.286 --> 03:41:45.789]  So I was shocked to see him having been a lawyer and having a wife that is a Russian expert who's involved in so many things.
[03:41:46.209 --> 03:41:48.330]  So her background is very interesting.
[03:41:49.011 --> 03:41:51.071]  She had a degree in Russian literature from Harvard.
[03:41:51.792 --> 03:42:00.615]  Nelly Orr went to Vassar, and she wrote and translated on topics such as Russian science and technology, Russian collectivization.
[03:42:02.759 --> 03:42:05.421]  I think she's the obvious connection between all the parties.
[03:42:06.661 --> 03:42:08.883]  She can speak to the Russian author of the dossier.
[03:42:09.583 --> 03:42:22.130]  She's working with Fusion GPS and she can communicate with the Department of Justice through her husband, perhaps looking for them to put in the dossier the things they needed to be approved by the FISA courts.
[03:42:23.110 --> 03:42:25.372]  So the question remains, who did the colluding?
[03:42:25.432 --> 03:42:28.113]  Was it the Trump campaign or the Clinton campaign?
[03:42:28.474 --> 03:42:30.975]  And I think everything hinges on the authorship
[03:42:31.670 --> 03:42:32.552]  Of this dossier.
[03:42:34.215 --> 03:42:38.324]  Please take a look at it and I'll join you back at the top after the next break.
[03:42:58.197 --> 03:43:07.226]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[03:43:07.286 --> 03:43:15.513]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[03:43:15.694 --> 03:43:20.358]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[03:44:08.295 --> 03:44:15.663]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:44:16.343 --> 03:44:22.690]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[03:44:58.021 --> 03:45:06.889]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[03:45:08.090 --> 03:45:09.891]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[03:45:09.951 --> 03:45:17.077]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[03:45:17.478 --> 03:45:23.263]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[03:45:23.943 --> 03:45:25.264]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[03:45:25.885 --> 03:45:44.941]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[03:45:46.022 --> 03:45:50.144]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[03:45:50.464 --> 03:45:55.726]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult, but a lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[03:45:56.146 --> 03:45:57.166]  As above, so below.
[03:45:57.747 --> 03:46:00.568]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[03:46:01.468 --> 03:46:02.549]  Most tiny of scales.
[03:46:03.069 --> 03:46:04.170]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:46:04.570 --> 03:46:06.071]  America is building its wall.
[03:46:06.472 --> 03:46:06.932]  Will it work?
[03:46:07.072 --> 03:46:07.572]  We don't know.
[03:46:08.073 --> 03:46:08.653]  Is Trump right?
[03:46:09.354 --> 03:46:17.939]  Well, he's trying to at least fall through on his promise that we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[03:46:18.300 --> 03:46:24.204]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.

[03:46:31.986 --> 03:46:39.669]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[03:46:47.651 --> 03:46:50.032]  This is a 360 non-zero sum game win.
[03:46:50.672 --> 03:46:53.913]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com.

[03:47:01.936 --> 03:47:04.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:17.282 --> 03:47:23.585]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:26.986 --> 03:47:27.606]  Welcome back.
[03:47:27.866 --> 03:47:32.188]  Joel Gilbert with you, coming to you right from the left coast here in Los Angeles.
[03:47:33.028 --> 03:47:37.210]  I am hosting the Alex Jones Show for this segment, and I'm happy to be here with you.
[03:47:38.971 --> 03:47:40.271]  Russia, Russia, Russia.
[03:47:41.312 --> 03:47:46.674]  Why are Obama and Clinton so obsessed with pinning Russian collusion on Trump?
[03:47:47.634 --> 03:47:48.634]  Was it a diversion?
[03:47:49.615 --> 03:47:59.198]  This is this is where I'm going with this, because when we look at Barack Obama's first term in office, it was characterized by extraordinarily pro-Russian policies.
[03:48:00.198 --> 03:48:07.601]  Now, given the daily charges leveled by Democrats, it's time to take a really good look at where the Russiagate conspiracy really lies.
[03:48:08.701 --> 03:48:12.923]  Was Barack Obama a Russian sympathizer because of his family background?
[03:48:13.743 --> 03:48:21.687]  Because his real father was a Communist Party propagandist and pro-Russian Soviet agent during the Cold War, Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:48:22.307 --> 03:48:25.529]  Was Obama possibly blackmailed or controlled by the Russians?
[03:48:26.329 --> 03:48:42.116]  Let's revisit some clips from the Barack Obama-Mitt Romney debate, and also a clip from the South Korean nuclear summit in 2012, where a hot mic picked up a deeply worried Barack Obama speaking to Medvedev.
[03:48:42.217 --> 03:48:42.777]  Let's check it out.
[03:48:56.750 --> 03:49:01.312]  A few months ago, when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia.
[03:49:02.252 --> 03:49:02.852]  Not Al-Qaeda.
[03:49:03.272 --> 03:49:03.873]  You said Russia.
[03:49:04.353 --> 03:49:10.435]  And the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back, because, you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years.
[03:49:30.711 --> 03:49:32.052]  Okay, so what do we have here?
[03:49:32.512 --> 03:49:39.337]  In the debate with Mitt Romney, Obama is defending his pro-Russia policies when Romney's holding him to account.
[03:49:40.720 --> 03:49:47.503]  He's saying that Romney's idea that Russia needs to be considered an adversary is out of date.
[03:49:48.303 --> 03:49:55.325]  With Medvedev, you saw Obama lean over and place his hand on Medvedev's right forearm, and he whispers, this is my last election.
[03:49:55.925 --> 03:49:57.746]  After the election, I have more flexibility.
[03:49:58.446 --> 03:50:01.948]  Medvedev puts his hand on top of Obama's and says, I understand.
[03:50:01.968 --> 03:50:04.568]  I will transmit this information to Vladimir.
[03:50:05.109 --> 03:50:05.849]  I will stand with you.
[03:50:06.969 --> 03:50:13.373]  Now, this chilling exchange was not a Cold War spy movie where evil Ruskies are blackmailing an American president.
[03:50:13.913 --> 03:50:14.413]  It's real.
[03:50:15.374 --> 03:50:20.757]  Obama was saying that Russian policy will become American policy if he can just have a little more time.
[03:50:21.477 --> 03:50:27.880]  And then good cop Medvedev says he'll put in the word with bad cop Vladimir, says, I stand with you.
[03:50:27.960 --> 03:50:32.263]  So we see Obama begging for time and Romney holding him accountable.
[03:50:32.863 --> 03:50:36.245]  So I want to revisit those pro-Russia policy moves by Obama.
[03:50:37.259 --> 03:50:45.125]  When he took office in 2009, he canceled the U.S.-planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe that Putin had bitterly opposed.
[03:50:45.765 --> 03:50:51.069]  Mitt Romney called this a gift to Russia, and Putin called Obama's move correct and brave.
[03:50:52.270 --> 03:50:59.875]  Next thing, during Russia's clash with Georgia, Obama concluded a START agreement that removed U.S.
[03:50:59.935 --> 03:51:02.297]  forces, while Russian forces were not reduced.
[03:51:03.416 --> 03:51:06.818]  Then under the cover of the famous reset, Hillary Clinton's reset, the U.S.
[03:51:06.838 --> 03:51:11.961]  set up a joint commission to transfer previously forbidden technology to Russia.
[03:51:12.742 --> 03:51:18.405]  And in addition, Putin withdrew from an agreement to scuttle disposal of nuclear weapons.
[03:51:19.425 --> 03:51:20.546]  No response from Obama.
[03:51:21.787 --> 03:51:22.727]  Then, of course, the U.S.
[03:51:22.827 --> 03:51:25.369]  approved transfer of 20% of U.S.
[03:51:25.569 --> 03:51:28.731]  uranium reserves to a Russian-owned company, Uranium One.
[03:51:29.702 --> 03:51:37.228]  And best of all for Russia, Obama implemented a policy called leading from behind, which was disengagement from the world.
[03:51:38.549 --> 03:51:44.294]  This is the number one policy goal of the Russians since World War II, was to have U.S.
[03:51:44.374 --> 03:51:46.295]  withdrawal from its leadership position.
[03:51:46.375 --> 03:51:48.137]  That was their number one global objective.
[03:51:48.857 --> 03:51:56.183]  Without American leadership in the world, Russia was left to fill the vacuum, and they tipped the balance of power in their favor everywhere they saw fit.
[03:51:57.043 --> 03:51:58.084]  They invaded Crimea.
[03:51:58.424 --> 03:51:59.925]  They intervened in Syria.
[03:52:00.485 --> 03:52:04.848]  They even set up a base in Syria with barely lip service from the White House.
[03:52:05.769 --> 03:52:16.056]  So given Obama's exchange with Medvedev, we have to ask, why would an American president implement pro-Russia policies so antithetical to American interests?
[03:52:16.856 --> 03:52:18.698]  Where did Obama's true sympathies lie?
[03:52:19.238 --> 03:52:21.820]  What leverage could the Russians have had over Obama?
[03:52:22.600 --> 03:52:26.603]  Now, of course, they had a file on Obama's father, Frank Marshall Davis, because
[03:52:27.702 --> 03:52:29.603]  His father worked for them during the Cold War.
[03:52:31.465 --> 03:52:38.510]  Now, this year, 2017, marks 100 years since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.
[03:52:39.631 --> 03:52:50.919]  Lenin's coup, where the fantasy of a perfect world achieved through abolishing free markets and private property, began a hundred-year-long murderous trail of destruction, misery, and suffering.
[03:52:51.580 --> 03:52:54.402]  Over 150 million people were killed in peacetime,
[03:52:55.123 --> 03:52:57.524]  By their own governments under communism.
[03:52:58.344 --> 03:53:01.005]  In Cambodia, they killed everyone that had glasses.
[03:53:01.125 --> 03:53:02.765]  Because if you had glasses, you could read.
[03:53:03.506 --> 03:53:05.006]  And that meant you were educated.
[03:53:05.206 --> 03:53:08.127]  And they wanted to create a new humanity, a new human being.
[03:53:09.468 --> 03:53:13.329]  And my concern and my question is, does America know better?
[03:53:14.229 --> 03:53:20.211]  Is America immune from falling under the disastrous ideology of socialism and communism?
[03:53:21.311 --> 03:53:23.332]  Let's take another look at a video of two
[03:53:24.261 --> 03:53:33.723]  Marxist politicians that we all know and revisit some things that they said and talk about whether America is susceptible to communism and socialism.
[03:53:35.023 --> 03:53:49.066]  And here is a New Year's resolution that I will keep if elected president and that is if Wall Street does not end its greed, we will end it for them.
[03:53:50.410 --> 03:53:57.535]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[03:53:58.355 --> 03:54:05.400]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:54:11.384 --> 03:54:13.525]  Not only will big banks
[03:54:14.540 --> 03:54:22.363]  Not be too big to fail, but big-time bankers will not be too big to jail.
[03:54:25.065 --> 03:54:30.167]  Okay, so Barack Obama said in 2008 he wanted a civilian national security force.
[03:54:30.827 --> 03:54:33.188]  Maybe like the Stasi in Germany, or SAVAK.
[03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:35.669]  He was describing a police state.
[03:54:36.470 --> 03:54:38.331]  And did you see behind him everyone clapped?
[03:54:39.351 --> 03:54:41.612]  They had no idea what he was talking about, but they clapped.
[03:54:42.193 --> 03:54:49.879]  And people voted for Obama twice, even though he said he wanted to create a civilian national security force stronger than our military.
[03:54:51.580 --> 03:54:54.602]  How could people possibly have voted for him knowing that he said this?
[03:54:54.722 --> 03:54:55.863]  But they voted for him twice.
[03:54:58.225 --> 03:55:03.468]  Now, also, Obama said of working-class Americans, they cling to their guns and religion.
[03:55:04.529 --> 03:55:06.090]  I want to spread the wealth around.
[03:55:06.170 --> 03:55:08.312]  We will reward our friends and punish our enemies.
[03:55:09.119 --> 03:55:14.000]  People also remember, of course, we're five days away from fundamentally transforming America.
[03:55:14.820 --> 03:55:21.461]  Obama had a radical past and a radical Marxist agenda, and people voted for him anyway.
[03:55:21.501 --> 03:55:24.562]  They did not fully understand where he was going.
[03:55:25.862 --> 03:55:27.682]  Then you have Bernie Sanders we saw in the video.
[03:55:27.702 --> 03:55:29.603]  He's talking about breaking up businesses.
[03:55:30.303 --> 03:55:32.243]  He says we're going to put businessmen in jail.
[03:55:33.003 --> 03:55:35.604]  Now this is what the Bolsheviks did back in 1917.
[03:55:38.166 --> 03:55:40.349]  This was the beginning of the path of destruction.
[03:55:40.909 --> 03:55:43.092]  The Bolsheviks jailed the entrepreneurs.
[03:55:43.112 --> 03:55:44.433]  They called them bourgeois at the time.
[03:55:45.054 --> 03:55:46.335]  Today we call them entrepreneurs.
[03:55:46.896 --> 03:55:49.298]  And the government bureaucrats took over these businesses.
[03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:56.106]  Within a few years, the bureaucrats became the leading class of society and they were very unproductive.
[03:55:56.887 --> 03:55:59.550]  There was no jobs, no food, starvation and death.
[03:56:00.945 --> 03:56:08.411]  But you have Bernie Sanders running around the country giving this speech about breaking up business, taking over the banks, breaking up the pharmaceutical companies.
[03:56:09.011 --> 03:56:10.893]  The business of America is business.
[03:56:11.013 --> 03:56:15.456]  This is what drives the free markets and drives all the wealth and prosperity.
[03:56:16.057 --> 03:56:17.598]  But people voted for Bernie Sanders.
[03:56:17.678 --> 03:56:24.563]  They still have him on TV listening to him talking about a political revolution, or breaking up all the banks, jailing the bankers.
[03:56:26.064 --> 03:56:29.607]  So, despite the electoral success of America First Donald Trump,
[03:56:30.712 --> 03:56:39.580]  I look out my window here in Southern California and I can see the Reagan Library and I recall Reagan's profound words that I want to leave with you today.
[03:56:40.521 --> 03:56:42.483]  He said, freedom is a fragile thing.
[03:56:43.144 --> 03:56:46.807]  It is never more than one generation away from extinction.
[03:56:47.487 --> 03:56:52.232]  Freedom must be fought for, protected and handed on to the next generation to do the same.
[03:56:53.064 --> 03:57:01.251]  As long as people are still voting for and listening to people like Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama, American democracy is still in grave danger.
[03:57:02.072 --> 03:57:09.399]  I'd like everyone please go to the Infowars store and take a look at my new film, The Art of the Insult.
[03:57:09.579 --> 03:57:13.082]  This is a film about the branding techniques that
[03:57:13.672 --> 03:57:15.434]  Donald Trump used for his political opponents.
[03:57:16.055 --> 03:57:20.260]  People forget that he was actually in the entertainment business for 30 years.
[03:57:20.680 --> 03:57:21.461]  Miss America.
[03:57:22.362 --> 03:57:23.123]  Pro Wrestling.
[03:57:23.163 --> 03:57:23.784]  The Apprentice.
[03:57:24.044 --> 03:57:26.608]  So he knew how to manipulate the media and control the narrative.
[03:57:27.088 --> 03:57:28.049]  Go to the Infowars store.
[03:57:28.089 --> 03:57:29.271]  Please support Infowars.
[03:57:29.731 --> 03:57:30.772]  Trump the art of the insult.
[03:57:33.453 --> 03:57:34.494]  Get it and show your friends.
[03:57:34.534 --> 03:57:35.715]  It's a great group experience.
[03:57:35.735 --> 03:57:41.039]  We showed it in Los Angeles two nights ago and we had 300 people laughing non-stop.
[03:57:41.940 --> 03:57:47.004]  So check out the art of the insult and I will see you next time.
[03:57:47.044 --> 03:57:48.185]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:48.746 --> 03:57:49.567]  Mike in Arizona.
[03:57:49.587 --> 03:57:50.607]  You're on the air worldwide.
[03:57:50.647 --> 03:57:50.948]  Go ahead.
[03:57:51.873 --> 03:57:53.774]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[03:57:53.814 --> 03:58:03.221]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[03:58:04.322 --> 03:58:07.684]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[03:58:08.124 --> 03:58:08.404]  Absolutely.
[03:58:30.199 --> 03:58:30.819]  Absolutely.
[03:58:30.839 --> 03:58:43.849]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[03:58:49.774 --> 03:58:51.395]  Matt in Ohio, you're on the air.
[03:58:51.435 --> 03:58:52.335]  Another Matt, go ahead.
[03:58:52.375 --> 03:58:59.781]  Yeah, hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a longtime listener of InfoWars, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys
