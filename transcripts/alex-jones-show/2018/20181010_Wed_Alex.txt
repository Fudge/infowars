[00:00:02.831 --> 00:00:04.632]  It's Wednesday, October 10th, 2018.
[00:00:05.252 --> 00:00:08.554]  We're now only 27 days out from the midterms.
[00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:15.559]  And yes, Hurricane Michael is slamming into the Florida panhandle as we speak.
[00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.661]  At 140 miles an hour, they're calling it the hellstorm.
[00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:32.254]  So notice the media hyped up the hurricane a month ago that they thought would be totally devastating and it was bad but not as devastating as they thought and then now out of nowhere comes Hurricane Michael and it looks like it is going to be a hell storm.
[00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:33.895]  So let's pray for everybody.
[00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:40.722]  Obviously they're in the panhandle, everybody in Louisiana, Mississippi especially, and other areas of the Deep South.
[00:00:41.282 --> 00:00:42.203]  But here's the deal.
[00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:46.906]  We've been dealing with natural storms on this planet since God created us.
[00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:48.507]  And they come and they go.
[00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:51.209]  And it's just part of life on this planet.
[00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.132]  But the cycle we're going through politically is the real issue.
[00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:56.552]  We've hit rock bottom.
[00:00:57.093 --> 00:01:04.838]  And we have our own corrupt elites allied with the communist Chinese and others in an attempt to try to totally take control of civilization and society.
[00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:18.507]  And with just 27 days out, we have reports flooding in that are on InfoWars.com with a whole string of critical reports that are absolutely critical that people check out.
[00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:21.208]  And the biggest one is Trump on Dimms.
[00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.190]  Their whole campaign is to resist.
[00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.290]  Ours is to create.
[00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:26.272]  These are not good people, folks.
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.684]  Now that's an important headline from Information Liberation, excellent website, informationliberation.com.
[00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:38.528]  But the article is really about the left launching vicious violent attacks all over the United States.
[00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:40.810]  We're going to look at some of these when we come back from break.
[00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:57.263]  You have got in blue controlled areas like San Francisco, like Portland, Oregon, like Seattle, Washington, like Austin, Texas, like Los Angeles, California, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois, the left
[00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:16.957]  Literally shooting police officers in the back of the head, burning Trump supporters' vehicles, vandalizing every day Republican candidate headquarters, shooting members of Congress, doxing their families, sending them beheading videos, breaking Rand Paul's ribs, puncturing his lung.
[00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:20.840]  So much violence, I can't even keep track of it.
[00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.782]  And then we've got Hillary Clinton, and we're going to play a clip of this when we come back,
[00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:29.275]  Saying that, oh, there's no place for civil discourse.
[00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:33.837]  Because you've got all the Republicans and us and others saying, let's have civil discourse, let's not have violence.
[00:02:34.377 --> 00:02:38.979]  And you've got Hillary Clinton and others saying, oh no, until we win the midterms, we're not going to be civil.
[00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.960]  Well, we know they're going to get worse if they do win the midterms.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.280]  This is an authoritarian push.
[00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:47.082]  And then you've got people like the editor of Raw Story.
[00:02:47.902 --> 00:02:54.104]  When Congressman Scalise, who was shot in the hospital months, almost died, shattered a whole bunch of his bones, organs.
[00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:55.225]  It's a tough cookie.
[00:02:56.584 --> 00:02:59.067]  He survived combat in Iraq but almost got killed here.
[00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:05.354]  And the scumbag coming to shoot him was trying to kill all 17 Republicans that were conservative.
[00:03:05.674 --> 00:03:06.375]  That was his plan.
[00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.297]  Thank God the leftists couldn't shoot very well.
[00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:15.931]  You see the Raw Story editor celebrating and saying, boo-hoo, you know, you deserve this.
[00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:18.675]  This is a responsive defense against you.
[00:03:18.695 --> 00:03:20.177]  You can go read his tweets.
[00:03:20.637 --> 00:03:21.418]  I'm paraphrasing him.
[00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:24.502]  And then other people defended that and Twitter leaves that up.
[00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:27.446]  Just like the professors that say, you know, kill.
[00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:33.787]  Gorsuch cut his testicles off, or excuse me, kill Kavanaugh.
[00:03:34.307 --> 00:03:36.489]  This is the type of insanity we're dealing with.
[00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:38.390]  And it's only intensifying.
[00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:41.112]  And they're going to get more violent if they win the midterms.
[00:03:41.132 --> 00:03:43.313]  They're going to get more violent if they lose the midterms.
[00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:50.158]  They are now truly a domestic terror organization, just as Homeland Security listed them as that a year and a half ago.
[00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:58.664]  But we have to get on the ball and deal with this, because when you look at the white trash scum that makes up Antifa, literal little black clothed
[00:04:00.045 --> 00:04:00.785]  Skinny jeans.
[00:04:02.026 --> 00:04:02.766]  Welfare head.
[00:04:03.527 --> 00:04:04.368]  Scum, basically.
[00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:39.824]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.521]  Well, the moment of truth is here.
[00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:47.462]  George Soros now is taking control of PayPal and he's banned us.
[00:04:47.482 --> 00:04:51.983]  They're trying to shut down our final payment processors and end InfoWars.
[00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:53.084]  We've now reached this point.
[00:04:53.684 --> 00:04:56.925]  And listen, I knew fighting the globalists, there'd be a price to pay.
[00:04:57.225 --> 00:05:00.207]  And I did it because I knew what horrible individuals they were.
[00:05:00.727 --> 00:05:06.289]  And I was willing to sacrifice myself, my name, my treasure, on the altar of having a better future like our forebears did.
[00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.770]  But I don't want to go down without a real fight.
[00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.651]  Because I'm going to keep swinging until the end.
[00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:27.624]  But if you, the listeners, really awaken and financially support us like never before with the payment systems we have left at InfoWarsTore.com, it is going to allow us to really hold the line like the Alamo until we either win or we're defeated.
[00:05:28.205 --> 00:05:39.894]  So in the words of the great founder of Texas, and that wasn't Houston, that was Colonel Travis, victory or death, we are going to win if you take action.
[00:05:40.134 --> 00:05:41.195]  We're going to win if you support us.
[00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:42.456]  But it's now all in your hands.
[00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.995]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:05:58.015 --> 00:05:59.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:07.056 --> 00:06:14.699]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.
[00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:23.502]  That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's when civility can start again.
[00:06:23.782 --> 00:06:30.045]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for.
[00:06:30.085 --> 00:06:33.346]  That's Hillary Clinton, the sore loser, on CNN last night.
[00:06:33.826 --> 00:06:34.427]  Think about that.
[00:06:34.487 --> 00:06:35.188]  What is she saying?
[00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:36.670]  Well, she's projecting.
[00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.912]  They always do the inverse.
[00:06:38.193 --> 00:06:43.200]  Just like the creator of Minecraft has come out and said, look, liberals are now inherently the party of evil.
[00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.712]  So with 27 days out from the election
[00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:20.783]  We can survive things like Hurricane Michael that is going to be devastating and a serious problem.
[00:07:21.784 --> 00:07:22.865]  A part of life on this planet.
[00:07:23.745 --> 00:07:26.387]  We'll have coverage of that coming up at the bottom of the hour with the latest.
[00:07:27.128 --> 00:07:40.058]  But it's the political crisis and the cultural crisis and the spiritual crisis of the inherent nastiness and cultural and spiritual
[00:07:41.798 --> 00:07:52.481]  Vandals that truly wish because they don't have inherent power and they don't have God in their heart and soul to pull down the universe and to seek and destroy everything that is decent.
[00:07:53.381 --> 00:08:09.865]  Those of us that don't want to be inherently evil and who aren't inherently out looking to destroy other people can't understand why globalists and their minions will go out of their way to do bad things when good things that they could do would actually build them and others up.
[00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:12.909]  But it's been part of a decadence process.
[00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:32.637]  The problem with a big, free, open society is it creates so much wealth that within a few generations, it always creates very nasty, very decadent, very spoiled elites, but also giant throngs of people that don't want to work and who ally themselves with the establishment as their muscle.
[00:08:33.317 --> 00:08:34.397]  It happened in ancient China.
[00:08:34.637 --> 00:08:35.638]  It happened in ancient Rome.
[00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:40.539]  It happened in ancient areas of the Middle Ages throughout Western Europe.
[00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:42.260]  It's happened in Latin America.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.160]  Look at Venezuela.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.021]  It happens over and over again.
[00:08:45.121 --> 00:08:46.841]  It's called mob rule.
[00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:50.182]  And that's what we're going into right now.
[00:08:50.902 --> 00:08:52.703]  So, again, front and center today.
[00:08:52.723 --> 00:08:55.864]  And if you're a TV viewer, you can see this incredible footage.
[00:08:55.884 --> 00:08:58.765]  If you're a radio listener, obviously, you can hear the shocking audio.
[00:08:58.825 --> 00:08:59.565]  Most of it bleeped.
[00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:02.686]  But we have footage from all over.
[00:09:03.885 --> 00:09:04.386]  The country.
[00:09:26.988 --> 00:09:27.629]  Portland, Oregon.
[00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:38.202]  If you don't let them direct you wherever they want while they yell and scream and cuss at you, they beat your car with medical, with metal batons, and they say, F you white scumbag.
[00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:40.519]  Or they say, F you rapists.
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.383]  If you're white, they're authorized to be mean to you because that's the brainwashing.
[00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:55.692]  And whether it's in Baltimore, Maryland or whether it's in Portland, Oregon or Seattle, Washington, they all get training manuals funded by George Soros and Alexander Soros.
[00:09:56.012 --> 00:10:01.998]  And we got secret documents in January of this year that I've made a big deal of because they are the Rosetta Stone understanding this.
[00:10:02.598 --> 00:10:06.722]  And it's 20 plus pages of an action manual for one of the managers.
[00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:30.997]  And the individual's brother, when he got in trouble, got the stuff out of his house, where they're paid handsomely in blue cities to work with the police in controlled areas to block roads, to break windows, to set things on fire, to even sometimes burn vehicles, which they pre-deploy as part of a drill that they burn.
[00:10:31.737 --> 00:10:32.398]  But here's the key.
[00:10:33.735 --> 00:10:34.535]  Yes, it's theater.
[00:10:34.615 --> 00:10:35.376]  Yes, it's fake.
[00:10:35.616 --> 00:10:36.556]  With the antifa.
[00:10:36.717 --> 00:10:50.484]  But they're there on the news during day one of whatever provocation there is, if the police shoot somebody, it's a questionable shooting or whatever the case may be, whether the police beat somebody, questionably or not questionably, then that draws out
[00:10:51.581 --> 00:11:07.306]  The Antifa, who go into operation, they already have their manual, and then day two, or sometimes even that night, the general public sees it on the news, the news shows it is favorable, shows Antifa is favorable, the police stand down, and then the general public starts showing up.
[00:11:07.726 --> 00:11:14.308]  And in the Baltimore, Maryland documents, they say, we're targeting the black community.
[00:11:14.808 --> 00:11:19.450]  We're trying to get the urban community to get angry and cause a chain reaction.
[00:11:21.249 --> 00:11:31.098]  So, these are false flags, but they're trying to then trigger the general public to come out, and it talks about where you go, what streets you're allowed to attack, what trash cans you're allowed to burn.
[00:11:31.358 --> 00:11:32.900]  That's why it's like, why do they burn a trash can?
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.861]  Why do they attack this particular store?
[00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:38.204]  Why do they throw bottles at the police, but they're not really throwing them that hard?
[00:11:39.232 --> 00:11:42.293]  Because in the blue cities, the police have been ordered to stand down.
[00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:48.136]  And the captains and others are working with the Antifa and even having pre-planning meetings before.
[00:11:48.236 --> 00:11:51.397]  The model of this was 1999 in Seattle.
[00:11:52.138 --> 00:11:54.979]  And I made the film, The Takeover, that's still on YouTube.
[00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.539]  on other folks' channels.
[00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:57.499]  Our channel's been removed.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.440]  It's Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.480]  And we even got the training manuals.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.381]  Delta Force, under the command of Bill Clinton, must say the military's bad, but they were under his command.
[00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:19.984]  Delta Force actually managed the Antifa, put them in a government building, housed them, protected them, and then allowed them to attack the police for a day, so they could then turn the police and the federal police on the 50,000 peaceful demonstrators
[00:12:20.484 --> 00:12:27.506]  That were liberals and were against transferring power to the World Trade Organization because they saw it as globalist and corrupt.
[00:12:27.826 --> 00:12:34.869]  That was back when the left was against globalism and realized it was neoliberal colonial fascism, actually good leftists.
[00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:37.330]  And so that's how the whole thing started.
[00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:39.432]  Soros was even funding it then.
[00:12:40.153 --> 00:12:47.678]  So you use them as the group to get a riot going, and then you can bring your control in to clamp down everybody after Antifa's carried it out.
[00:12:47.898 --> 00:12:52.342]  Or, under Obama's plans, they were planning to stir it up even worse.
[00:12:52.622 --> 00:13:06.838]  According to these documents to try to create martial law in Baltimore and then other cities around the country to have blacks rise up and actually have a civil emergency and then announce strong city initiative for the UN to come in under the Attorney General Loretta Lynch.
[00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:08.640]  This is the mainstream news.
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:21.688]  And have the UN take over the police, and then they would order through Soros operatives and media for the blacks and others to stop rioting, who had been detonated by the white professor-level Antifa.
[00:13:22.208 --> 00:13:27.691]  These are mainly professors and people who are out doing AgiProp-type propaganda.
[00:13:27.711 --> 00:13:28.872]  I mean, there's manuals.
[00:13:29.172 --> 00:13:31.034]  The manuals have fallen into our hands.
[00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:38.160]  And I want to encourage other anti-fund people that realize this is wrong and evil and you've been programmed to send us more manuals and more documents.
[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.604]  But this is the main reason Soros and others have been coming after us.
[00:13:41.884 --> 00:13:53.116]  When I pointed out that they staged the situation in Charlottesville, not that the woman didn't really get killed, not that the individuals who were working in the whole Hillary
[00:13:53.556 --> 00:13:54.137]  We're good to go.
[00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:33.450]  They've now ordered Antifa that is centrally commanded by these rise-up groups and others that do the full-page ads and the New York Times and other publications calling for an overthrow of Trump and Pence and driving the regime from power.
[00:14:34.251 --> 00:14:38.695]  They're now more and more blocking traffic in morning rush hour and
[00:14:40.476 --> 00:14:45.318]  Agitating the vehicles and bumping the vehicles and saying, oh, are you going to hit me?
[00:14:45.578 --> 00:14:52.900]  And then even when someone doesn't even bump them because they're bumping them, they then chase the vehicles down and try to panic them.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.182]  And you almost saw another Charlottesville in Portland.
[00:14:58.604 --> 00:15:02.826]  Because they're terrorizing and beating the car with batons and the old man races away.
[00:15:03.526 --> 00:15:07.547]  And then he kind of realizes, wait, I don't want to be a hit and run if they just ran into me.
[00:15:07.807 --> 00:15:09.248]  So he stops and he's all dazed.
[00:15:09.308 --> 00:15:10.789]  He's like, why are you doing this?
[00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:11.629]  They're like, F you.
[00:15:11.649 --> 00:15:14.090]  I mean, you'll see the footage when we come back.
[00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.890]  I showed it yesterday.
[00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:16.211]  But it's so critical.
[00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:17.051]  It's so critical.
[00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:26.635]  Because they're trying to get another Charlottesville right now and they've got orders going out to these thugs, these street thugs that are paid like a thousand dollars a day to do this.
[00:15:26.975 --> 00:15:27.635]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:15:27.655 --> 00:15:28.695]  This is Critical Info.
[00:15:28.835 --> 00:15:29.976]  They're getting their false flag ready.
[00:15:30.176 --> 00:15:31.417]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[00:15:31.497 --> 00:15:32.297]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:42.196 --> 00:15:48.501]  There are a lot of people out there on television, radio, and on the internet, and print, telling you that they've got the answers.
[00:15:48.541 --> 00:15:49.622]  They know how the world really works.
[00:15:50.462 --> 00:15:52.964]  The funny thing is, nobody tries to shut them down.
[00:15:53.024 --> 00:15:54.345]  Nobody tries to keep them quiet.
[00:15:54.846 --> 00:16:01.711]  Because they're like a bunch of brainwashed, lobotomized monkeys running around, not knowing what they're really doing.
[00:16:02.872 --> 00:16:10.198]  But Infowars, now Hillary Clinton and George Soros and the Democratic Party and the EU and the Chi-Coms, they want us shut down.
[00:16:11.186 --> 00:16:15.887]  Because you see, I actually read the Chinese Communist Establishment Party newspapers.
[00:16:15.907 --> 00:16:20.008]  I actually read the Council on Foreign Relations bimonthly publication of Foreign Affairs.
[00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:28.950]  I've actually read hundreds and hundreds of books written by people like David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, so I know their larger game plan.
[00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:32.291]  I know the operation they're carrying out against humanity.
[00:16:32.711 --> 00:16:34.971]  And so, because I have their number, they want me shut down.
[00:16:35.592 --> 00:16:36.732]  Now you've seen massive
[00:16:37.452 --> 00:16:45.416]  Corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away, and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[00:16:46.116 --> 00:16:50.899]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:56.041]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[00:16:57.722 --> 00:17:11.048]  Now, we have major stockpiles of incredibly high quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday, and of course for Cyber Monday, and for Christmas!
[00:17:11.648 --> 00:17:15.830]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:22.452]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globalists coming down on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[00:17:22.732 --> 00:17:23.813]  Black Friday's coming early.
[00:17:24.699 --> 00:17:25.880]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.344]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed, starting now.
[00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:36.330]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[00:17:37.151 --> 00:17:44.658]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:47.701]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:17:48.883 --> 00:17:58.847]  InfoWars has always been in our hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:04.009]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.651]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[00:18:08.291 --> 00:18:13.273]  And so now they're coming after our ability at InfoWarsHore.com to even have credit card processing.
[00:18:13.293 --> 00:18:16.535]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[00:18:17.535 --> 00:18:19.057]  Get your X2.
[00:18:19.337 --> 00:18:21.740]  Even though it's selling out the last run, 50% off.
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:23.963]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[00:18:24.343 --> 00:18:25.785]  Super Metal Vitality, 50% off.
[00:18:26.506 --> 00:18:28.148]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[00:18:28.188 --> 00:18:30.530]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:34.295]  They don't even have 50% markup to take off, but they're discounted as well.
[00:18:35.496 --> 00:18:38.777]  Free shipping, store-wide, mpulwarestore.com.
[00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.997]  This is Christmas in October.
[00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:49.099]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great, the five-star ratings, and go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts so that you have them.
[00:18:49.659 --> 00:18:50.519]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:55.120]  Christmas is only two months away, and you can support the MPULWAR while getting great products to win-win.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.221]  I'm counting on you.
[00:18:56.241 --> 00:18:57.201]  You've always come through.
[00:18:57.641 --> 00:19:02.082]  They know you always come through, which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[00:19:02.762 --> 00:19:10.554]  With a five-star-rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have, they want to shut down because we're successful and we expose them.
[00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:14.680]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.
[00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:21.503]  We're in some serious times because we've been effective, we've been strong, we've been forceful, we've been successful.
[00:19:21.783 --> 00:19:23.605]  You've been successful by supporting us.
[00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:31.514]  So, InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareLife.com, today, in this mega sale, 50% off free shipping, to help bring the InfoWare to the next level.
[00:19:31.775 --> 00:19:32.636]  I'm counting on you.
[00:19:32.896 --> 00:19:33.817]  You always come through.
[00:19:34.137 --> 00:19:34.898]  Take advantage of this.
[00:19:34.938 --> 00:19:37.061]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[00:19:46.391 --> 00:19:49.113]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:19:56.037 --> 00:19:58.258]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:19:58.758 --> 00:20:03.981]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:08.804 --> 00:20:12.747]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:20:17.222 --> 00:20:18.882]  And we are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:18.962 --> 00:20:22.323]  If you just joined me, this is the most critical issue with 27 days out.
[00:20:22.943 --> 00:20:40.086]  We know that the Soros Group and others fund Antifa through the same national organizations and through university leadership, where they have university professors openly saying, kill Pence, kill Gorsuch, kill Kavanaugh, kill everybody, kill Trump, kill talk show host.
[00:20:40.746 --> 00:20:42.946]  Then they send the orders out to do different things.
[00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:44.807]  And they give them action plans.
[00:20:44.887 --> 00:20:45.887]  And the new action plan
[00:20:47.008 --> 00:21:04.812]  Which we know clearly was getting beta tested from the research we've seen from Antifa, is to go out and block roads and create crises, and then hope that you panic someone by chasing them and yelling at them and screaming at them, and then hoping that in the hysteria, somebody gets run over or somebody gets hurt.
[00:21:05.592 --> 00:21:08.073]  This almost happened in Portland two days ago.
[00:21:08.713 --> 00:21:09.913]  We just played that footage.
[00:21:10.293 --> 00:21:12.674]  I'm going to roll it again, just as B-roll.
[00:21:15.356 --> 00:21:21.759]  This is so horrifying, because the same thing that happened tragically in Charlottesville almost just happened again.
[00:21:22.099 --> 00:21:32.364]  And local media, working with local police, who you saw stand down in Portland, they were waiting down the street, overseeing it, in case anybody did resist Antifa, they could then be cracked down on.
[00:21:32.684 --> 00:21:36.266]  They were waiting with the experiment, like the CIA has practiced and many others.
[00:21:36.626 --> 00:21:39.848]  Jim Morrison studied this in college, is how to cause a riot.
[00:21:40.248 --> 00:21:42.189]  And so you've got the cars coming through rush hour.
[00:21:42.469 --> 00:21:43.609]  You're screaming names at them.
[00:21:43.629 --> 00:21:44.769]  You're calling them scumbags.
[00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:45.950]  You're calling them KKK.
[00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.130]  You're hitting their cars with batons.
[00:21:49.011 --> 00:21:50.051]  You're bumping their vehicles.
[00:21:51.171 --> 00:21:53.312]  They've just been given the orders, go agitate, block roads.
[00:21:54.192 --> 00:21:56.153]  So that someone else gets run over.
[00:21:57.995 --> 00:21:59.136]  The local thugs don't even know this.
[00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:01.897]  They're given the action plans, which have fallen into our hands.
[00:22:02.317 --> 00:22:09.440]  These are Death Star plans for Antifa, so that there can be another Charlottesville, and then it won't matter who runs over somebody.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:13.021]  They'll just call them a white supremacist on the news, and you saw local news do this.
[00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:16.102]  They said, oh my God, loving liberal demonstrators.
[00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:24.646]  The articles on InfoWars.com almost got run over and murdered by a right-wing extremist in Portland who rammed them with his vehicle.
[00:22:25.106 --> 00:22:29.369]  And of course, they don't show the F you, screw you, hitting his car with batons, chasing him down.
[00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:33.133]  They just show the people going, oh my God, it was so scary.
[00:22:33.373 --> 00:22:40.939]  We were lovingly out here in our black uniforms harassing everyone and blocking roads like thugs, you know, from Nazi Germany.
[00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:43.381]  And then this horrible mean people try to hurt us.
[00:22:43.941 --> 00:22:45.462]  And then that's how this works.
[00:22:45.843 --> 00:22:49.205]  And then if you question somebody getting killed, well,
[00:22:50.186 --> 00:22:52.707]  You're going to be called an extremist and fake news.
[00:22:53.527 --> 00:22:58.529]  Just like I didn't say that nobody died at Parkland in Florida this year.
[00:22:59.269 --> 00:22:59.670]  They don't care.
[00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:00.650]  They just say I did that.
[00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:02.631]  And I need to be sued for it.
[00:23:02.951 --> 00:23:03.231]  You see?
[00:23:04.351 --> 00:23:07.152]  So this is the mind control operation they're bringing in.
[00:23:07.192 --> 00:23:09.373]  This is the whole system we're dealing with right now.
[00:23:09.713 --> 00:23:14.055]  And you can see them now trying to activate a Charlottesville type crisis.
[00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:16.816]  Now, if you're a radio listener, you go to InfoWars.com.
[00:23:16.836 --> 00:23:17.796]  We have live streams of this.
[00:23:18.276 --> 00:23:19.217]  I want to zoom in.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:27.046]  On some of the videos of the people in the background and the Antifa leadership sending their thugs out on the street.
[00:23:27.106 --> 00:23:37.836]  And if you look at these individuals, I bet money if you get their mask off, they are local professors and local social workers and operatives of foundations.
[00:23:38.096 --> 00:23:45.522]  And they've got in their hip pockets, their little battle plans, you know, stamped from Alexander Soros's group, because he's really taken over from his dad.
[00:23:46.303 --> 00:24:09.677]  But if you look at the satisfaction, it's like something you saw in old newsreels of Nazi Germany, or old newsreels of Soviet Russia, where you see the commissars, the political police, and they're standing there with just looks of satisfaction, smoking cigarettes and watching people having traffic blocked, and families called names with their kids going to school, and trying to panic somebody into driving through the crowd.
[00:24:10.097 --> 00:24:11.618]  I mean, this is a sick op.
[00:24:11.658 --> 00:24:15.200]  You've got all the leftists standing around behind, the few that don't have masks on,
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:23.729]  With just gleeful, little villainous looks that, ooh, we've got the power, we're the political party, we're taking this country over.
[00:24:24.991 --> 00:24:26.833]  And I face these people all over the country.
[00:24:27.113 --> 00:24:31.718]  From Austin, Texas, to Seattle, Washington, to Washington, D.C., to Denver.
[00:24:32.901 --> 00:24:35.403]  I've been facing Antifa for 20 years.
[00:24:36.363 --> 00:24:41.167]  And Antifa are professors, they are communists, they are Maoist brigades.
[00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:46.210]  I try to go out and have a pro-life demonstration, they show up and try to block our signs and take our free speech.
[00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:51.033]  That's what they're all about, is taking your rights, suppressing you, keeping you off the streets.
[00:24:51.533 --> 00:24:55.456]  While big tech censors you off the web, they censor you off the streets.
[00:24:56.957 --> 00:24:58.158]  In blue cities, they're cowards.
[00:24:58.438 --> 00:25:00.820]  With the police and the media protecting them.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.421]  Soros and globalist money.
[00:25:03.598 --> 00:25:05.199]  Media lying and covering for them.
[00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:07.239]  When they attack women and children, they're heroes.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.900]  And they say the opposite happened.
[00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:23.446]  And big media, big tech, censoring, and then Antifa on the street, trying to get the proletariat, trying to get the general populace to rise up.
[00:25:23.466 --> 00:25:28.568]  And they got all the Hollywood movies that are agitating it, and white people are racist, and there needs to be a race war.
[00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:29.889]  It's all coming together.
[00:25:30.829 --> 00:25:34.031]  It's in the WikiLeaks that came out that Hillary was trying to push a race war.
[00:25:34.431 --> 00:25:35.131]  It's come out.
[00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:44.196]  They've had the left antifa on tape and top Twitter people that Twitter uses to attack Trump saying, hey, we're here to sow the division.
[00:25:44.496 --> 00:25:45.757]  We're here to divide America.
[00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:47.498]  Everything Trump has said.
[00:25:48.078 --> 00:25:49.519]  Everything Trump has said.
[00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:51.980]  That's what these people are doing.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.260]  So again, why am I so excited?
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.200]  Why am I so focused?
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:54.960]  Why am I so upset?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.461]  Because this is their battle plan.
[00:25:56.801 --> 00:25:57.721]  This is their program.
[00:25:57.961 --> 00:25:59.662]  And they don't want us to be getting the word out.
[00:25:59.702 --> 00:26:09.625]  That's why they're censoring InfoWars and trying to block us ahead of the midterms because they're planning to provocateur and stage these crises to bring in total control.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.784]  So again, take this live stream, and later when we archive this video, to InfoWars.com.
[00:26:16.425 --> 00:26:20.728]  We have discovered how they're trying to stage a new false flag, at least one of their operations.
[00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:34.140]  And we understand it, and we know how to beat it, and law enforcement is getting informed, and you're getting informed, and I'm getting informed, and Congress is getting informed, and it's a very, very exciting time, and also a very, very dangerous time to be alive.
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:40.785]  That said, we'll cover this very serious hurricane that's just made landfall, Hurricane Michael, hitting the panhandle when we come back.
[00:26:41.726 --> 00:26:42.606]  I want to say this again.
[00:26:43.107 --> 00:26:55.196]  We're running the biggest special ever with free shipping and 50% off, because as you know, they're trying to shut down our websites now, and our shopping cart, and our ability to even take payment processing, taking PayPal away, trying to take the others away.
[00:26:55.216 --> 00:26:57.198]  A lot of you have really responded to this sale.
[00:26:57.278 --> 00:27:03.403]  Thank you, because we need to bring in the provisions and funding to go forward under this unwavering globalist attack.
[00:27:03.743 --> 00:27:12.829]  But because of you, we're still standing strong and, quite frankly, getting ready to expand in their face with some big announcements that Owen Schroer is going to tell you about when we come back.
[00:27:13.149 --> 00:27:20.614]  We're going to do election coverage at least two hours a night, starting tonight, right through Election Day and right after Election Day.
[00:27:20.654 --> 00:27:28.299]  Then we're going to announce new shows that are going to be launched in that same time slot, right after we complete that coverage in about 29 days or so.
[00:27:28.579 --> 00:27:30.441]  We'll have election coverage a few days after.
[00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:32.142]  Obviously, there's going to be a lot of tumult.
[00:27:32.782 --> 00:27:43.915]  But we have got great products, great supplements, great air filtration, water filtration, non-GMO heirloom seeds, emergency gear, high quality storable food, whatever is the best out there.
[00:27:44.335 --> 00:27:46.698]  We get it, we source it, and we give you the best prices.
[00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:50.380]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.180]  We have all the top supplements.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.581]  Even though they're selling out, we've got to clear the warehouse out in case they shut us down.
[00:27:55.821 --> 00:27:58.182]  We've got to have money to operate the next six months or so.
[00:27:58.242 --> 00:28:01.042]  So get to Infowarsstore.com right now.
[00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:10.165]  Free shipping, 50% off on all the supplements, a bunch of other huge deals, a bunch of other huge specials at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:11.565]  I am in your hands.
[00:28:11.605 --> 00:28:13.045]  Infowars is in your hands.
[00:28:15.686 --> 00:28:19.351]  Your prayers, your financial support, you spreading the word is what allows us to do what we do.
[00:28:19.751 --> 00:28:20.793]  You are the InfoWard.
[00:28:20.813 --> 00:28:21.894]  I thank you for your support.
[00:28:22.194 --> 00:28:25.479]  I thank you because we're turning the country and the world around because of you.
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.160]  Did you hear?
[00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:50.502]  Christmas is coming in October.
[00:28:50.522 --> 00:28:52.002]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[00:28:52.543 --> 00:28:54.203]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[00:28:54.264 --> 00:28:58.086]  What's really coming in October is incredible deals.
[00:28:58.106 --> 00:29:01.007]  50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[00:29:01.747 --> 00:29:08.871]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:14.294]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo bird.
[00:29:15.452 --> 00:29:16.373]  For the way of the dinosaurs.
[00:29:16.613 --> 00:29:18.955]  Because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[00:29:20.216 --> 00:29:23.880]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us.
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:29.925]  And you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away so we can't even process orders.
[00:29:30.626 --> 00:29:35.390]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:40.515]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[00:29:42.196 --> 00:29:55.524]  Now we have major stockpiles of incredibly high quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday and of course for Cyber Monday and for Christmas.
[00:29:56.104 --> 00:30:00.247]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[00:30:01.428 --> 00:30:06.773]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[00:30:07.194 --> 00:30:09.136]  Black Friday's coming early.
[00:30:09.176 --> 00:30:10.377]  Cyber Monday's coming early.
[00:30:10.498 --> 00:30:16.484]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:22.431]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[00:30:23.396 --> 00:30:30.985]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[00:30:31.665 --> 00:30:33.728]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:30:34.992 --> 00:30:44.979]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world after Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.063]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[00:30:50.604 --> 00:30:53.766]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[00:30:54.406 --> 00:30:59.350]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:02.652]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[00:31:03.673 --> 00:31:04.834]  Get your X2.
[00:31:05.074 --> 00:31:07.856]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off.
[00:31:08.176 --> 00:31:10.077]  Brain Force, selling out, 50% off.
[00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:11.919]  SuperMill Vitality, 50% off.
[00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:14.080]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.622]  Now, I do that with air filtration, water filtration.
[00:31:17.002 --> 00:31:20.425]  They don't even have 30% markup take off, but they're discounted as well.
[00:31:20.685 --> 00:31:25.148]  And free shipping, store wide, MFOMoreStore.com.
[00:31:25.168 --> 00:31:27.709]  So this is the October
[00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:30.671]  Black Friday coming early.
[00:31:31.071 --> 00:31:32.232]  This is Christmas coming early.
[00:31:32.632 --> 00:31:34.153]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[00:31:34.313 --> 00:31:36.354]  This is Christmas in October.
[00:31:36.934 --> 00:31:39.995]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[00:31:40.096 --> 00:31:40.936]  The five-star ratings.
[00:31:40.956 --> 00:31:42.937]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts.
[00:31:43.637 --> 00:31:44.498]  So that you have them.
[00:31:44.638 --> 00:31:45.918]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:47.139]  Christmas is only two months away.
[00:31:47.919 --> 00:31:50.541]  And you can support the M4 War while getting great products to win-win.
[00:31:50.561 --> 00:31:51.621]  I'm counting on you.
[00:31:51.641 --> 00:31:52.581]  You've always come through.
[00:31:53.022 --> 00:31:54.182]  They know you always come through.
[00:31:54.482 --> 00:31:57.464]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[00:31:58.144 --> 00:32:02.867]  With a five-star rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[00:32:02.887 --> 00:32:05.788]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[00:32:05.848 --> 00:32:06.589]  Nobody's got that.
[00:32:07.309 --> 00:32:08.170]  Credit card processing.
[00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.611]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[00:32:10.891 --> 00:32:11.491]  We expose them.
[00:32:11.652 --> 00:32:15.594]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.
[00:32:17.338 --> 00:32:22.383]  We're in some serious times because we've been effective, we've been strong, we've been forceful, we've been successful.
[00:32:22.744 --> 00:32:24.526]  You've been successful by supporting us.
[00:32:24.566 --> 00:32:32.434]  So, InfoWareStore.com, InfoWareLife.com today in this mega sale, 50% off free shipping to help bring the InfoWare to the next level.
[00:32:32.674 --> 00:32:33.555]  I'm counting on you.
[00:32:33.815 --> 00:32:34.716]  You always come through.
[00:32:35.057 --> 00:32:35.798]  Take advantage of this.
[00:32:35.838 --> 00:32:37.980]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[00:32:46.295 --> 00:32:49.039]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:49.079 --> 00:32:49.440]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.247]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.937 --> 00:33:10.919]  O. S. Royer is about to take over live.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.501]  I should be back in studio tomorrow.
[00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:14.744]  Again, I want to thank you all for your prayers and support.
[00:33:14.864 --> 00:33:15.925]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:16.206 --> 00:33:23.034]  If you're a new viewer or listening on local radio stations or TV stations, please, listeners, don't just support InfoWars, support those local stations.
[00:33:23.354 --> 00:33:24.756]  They are just as important as we are.
[00:33:25.096 --> 00:33:25.977]  Become a sponsor.
[00:33:26.318 --> 00:33:27.219]  Thank their sponsors.
[00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:29.001]  Send the local station a hundred bucks.
[00:33:29.321 --> 00:33:29.981]  And a thank you note.
[00:33:30.401 --> 00:33:31.142]  We're in a war.
[00:33:31.262 --> 00:33:32.502]  It takes money to win a war.
[00:33:33.022 --> 00:33:34.423]  They've been trying to shut down talk radio.
[00:33:34.443 --> 00:33:35.903]  They've been trying to shut down local TV.
[00:33:36.283 --> 00:33:51.588]  But it's becoming more important than ever, with all the censorship hitting the web, that we understand that talk radio and local television is critical and that word of mouth trumps big tech censorship, antifa censorship, the college's censoring, and their attempt to bring us into authoritarianism.
[00:33:52.528 --> 00:33:54.429]  And they've overplayed their hand.
[00:33:54.469 --> 00:33:56.890]  There is a huge awakening taking place across the planet.
[00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:58.340]  Not just here.
[00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:04.468]  Nationalist and populist candidates, and just common sense candidates, Trump-type candidates are being elected everywhere.
[00:34:04.989 --> 00:34:06.331]  From Brazil to Europe.
[00:34:07.092 --> 00:34:07.573]  That's why.
[00:34:08.534 --> 00:34:10.997]  The enemy is coming down like a ton of bricks, and that's why again.
[00:34:11.874 --> 00:34:14.074]  We're running the biggest special in our history.
[00:34:14.615 --> 00:34:15.195]  It's Christmas.
[00:34:15.435 --> 00:34:16.255]  It's Thanksgiving.
[00:34:16.475 --> 00:34:18.555]  It's Black Friday.
[00:34:18.635 --> 00:34:19.956]  It's Cyber Monday.
[00:34:20.076 --> 00:34:20.716]  All rolled into one.
[00:34:20.756 --> 00:34:21.696]  These are all the specials.
[00:34:22.196 --> 00:34:26.537]  We were going to dole out over the next two months, at once, now.
[00:34:27.357 --> 00:34:31.118]  And I had it where a lot of stuff wouldn't be on special because we weren't going to have more come into the new year.
[00:34:31.578 --> 00:34:32.078]  That's how you do it.
[00:34:32.098 --> 00:34:32.898]  You sell your inventory.
[00:34:33.138 --> 00:34:34.539]  By the end of the year, you've got to pay tax on it.
[00:34:35.119 --> 00:34:40.660]  And so I was going to dole it out and have sometimes a regular price, sometimes it's sale, so we could bring in more money and fund ourselves.
[00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:49.691]  I can't do that because they are, as you've seen, cutting us back to where we may not even be able to operate, other than you writing checks into us, you know, for product.
[00:34:50.892 --> 00:34:53.074]  And so, payment processing's up right now.
[00:34:53.394 --> 00:34:54.655]  Get your order in, it gets right to you.
[00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:57.337]  Do your Christmas shopping now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:57.677 --> 00:34:58.858]  Get the products you need now.
[00:34:58.878 --> 00:35:01.820]  Get X2, it's the last run of it, but we're selling out of it.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:06.363]  Hopefully we'll get a better supply of it and be able to redo it, but at this time that deal's not been made.
[00:35:07.574 --> 00:35:08.514]  So I got a trick up my sleeve.
[00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:16.276]  The point is, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, get your brain force, get your body's ultimate tumour formula, get the highest quality fish oils for children and adults.
[00:35:16.636 --> 00:35:22.898]  Krill oil, wild harvested of the fjord salmon oil with special processes that remove the mercury.
[00:35:23.178 --> 00:35:24.678]  Highest quality, great prices.
[00:35:25.098 --> 00:35:27.199]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:28.379]  You shop with us.
[00:35:29.099 --> 00:35:30.240]  You fund our operation.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.381]  We will be steadfast.
[00:35:31.681 --> 00:35:34.404]  We will build the new model to relaunch America and the world.
[00:35:34.704 --> 00:35:35.405]  We're doing it.
[00:35:35.725 --> 00:35:36.746]  You see what Trump says.
[00:35:36.806 --> 00:35:37.807]  We want to build the world.
[00:35:38.027 --> 00:35:39.208]  We want a pro-human future.
[00:35:39.468 --> 00:35:41.130]  The globalists want an anti-human future.
[00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.573]  Everything we've said is now the operating system of the relaunch.
[00:35:45.113 --> 00:35:46.835]  We rebooted.
[00:35:47.255 --> 00:35:47.876]  I just got chills.
[00:35:48.496 --> 00:35:53.101]  InfoWorks took the best of Americana, the best of the Renaissance, the best of what the globalists don't like,
[00:35:54.312 --> 00:35:59.754]  With history, and a belief in our destiny and the love of Christ, and fused it together with the American reboot.
[00:36:00.314 --> 00:36:02.234]  That's like selling snow cones in hell, folks.
[00:36:02.795 --> 00:36:11.177]  The globalists are selling tyranny, and hatred, and division, and back-broken systems, and twisted garbage, and racism.
[00:36:11.237 --> 00:36:14.618]  We are promoting what humans are really meant to do, go to the stars.
[00:36:15.198 --> 00:36:16.899]  But it takes funding in this war.
[00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:19.700]  I'm willing to go all the way, never back down, never give in.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:27.804]  But I need your prayers, I need you to share the articles and videos, and I need you to absolutely get the products that you need already at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:27.864 --> 00:36:28.665]  Biggest sale ever.
[00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:30.366]  Take advantage of it right now.
[00:36:30.826 --> 00:36:34.888]  And again, you stand with us, and God stands with us, and we all stand together.
[00:36:35.308 --> 00:36:36.149]  We are unstoppable.
[00:36:36.549 --> 00:36:38.150]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:45.554]  Buy your war bonds today, and we absolutely commit to you to turning up another notch in the face of the NWO.
[00:36:47.892 --> 00:36:51.115]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, so you've just heard from Alex Jones.
[00:36:51.395 --> 00:36:52.876]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:36:52.916 --> 00:36:57.620]  Welcome back live to the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:37:12.851]  Now, while Alex, as of now, may be done for the day, he is working on an exclusive breaking news report right now that we expect to release definitely by the end of the week, maybe by the end of the day.
[00:37:13.932 --> 00:37:17.075]  And it's shocking.
[00:37:18.416 --> 00:37:24.281]  In its content, but at the same time, it's like there is no other option for this individual.
[00:37:25.102 --> 00:37:30.867]  And so we will be working on that and maybe even revealing that today.
[00:37:31.067 --> 00:37:33.149]  So be monitoring InfoWars.com.
[00:37:33.749 --> 00:37:37.192]  Of course, they're not going to allow that to spread on social media.
[00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:40.095]  They'll shut you down and censor you if you try to share it.
[00:37:40.155 --> 00:37:42.557]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[00:37:42.617 --> 00:37:45.519]  But there's still plenty of news and I'm going to open up the phone lines because
[00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.330]  No guests on the schedule today.
[00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.951]  Roger Stone will join me in the fourth hour, but no guests.
[00:37:52.551 --> 00:38:02.813]  So I'm going to open up the phone lines and I'm going to try to take as many calls as possible today while getting through this news and hitting all the video clips in the next two and a half hours.
[00:38:03.853 --> 00:38:06.233]  So in fact, guys, let's go ahead and just start taking calls right now.
[00:38:06.253 --> 00:38:06.533]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[00:38:06.553 --> 00:38:06.713]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[00:38:06.733 --> 00:38:08.154]  And the lines will be filled in 30 seconds.
[00:38:16.224 --> 00:38:18.345]  27 days, guys, is that the updated number?
[00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:21.185]  27 days till the midterms?
[00:38:22.386 --> 00:38:34.808]  I would say for the topic, you know, if they wanted to call in and still weigh in on the Trump-Rosenstein situation, because we didn't really clear out all the calls on that, we'll take calls.
[00:38:34.868 --> 00:38:40.290]  What do you think about the Trump-Rosenstein, which was a big deal, then wasn't a big deal, and then did Trump flip Rosenstein?
[00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:43.771]  Was Rosenstein basically a double-O agent the whole time?
[00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:44.891]  Okay, so what's going on with that?
[00:38:47.136 --> 00:38:56.482]  I guess, I think that the big question or concern on everyone's mind right now is, where does the left go from here?
[00:38:58.823 --> 00:39:09.970]  And quite frankly, I think Rand Paul understands what's going on and in a recent interview, we'll have the clip later on in the broadcast.
[00:39:11.383 --> 00:39:15.385]  Rand Paul is worried someone is going to be killed in the current political climate.
[00:39:15.425 --> 00:39:16.766]  Well, yeah.
[00:39:17.606 --> 00:39:22.329]  His name was Steve Scalise and luckily he didn't get killed.
[00:39:22.789 --> 00:39:25.970]  His name was Rand Paul and luckily he didn't get killed.
[00:39:26.811 --> 00:39:33.654]  He was the man running against Eric Swalwell in California where the guy tried to stab him with a switchblade that was inoperative.
[00:39:35.135 --> 00:39:36.396]  So, yeah.
[00:39:37.406 --> 00:39:40.689]  The left has already tried to kill multiple people in this country.
[00:39:41.669 --> 00:39:44.251]  It's by God's grace they haven't yet.
[00:39:48.795 --> 00:39:52.878]  And they're just going to keep pushing the envelope, though, until it happens.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.381]  So, where do you think the left goes from here?
[00:39:58.402 --> 00:40:01.164]  What does President Trump have to do about it?
[00:40:01.264 --> 00:40:04.287]  Or what do we have to do about it to try to stop it?
[00:40:05.322 --> 00:40:17.331]  And then if you want to weigh in on the issue of yesterday, that we didn't get to all the calls, what do you think of the Trump-Rosenstein situation and the meeting?
[00:40:18.032 --> 00:40:20.494]  Isn't Kanye West having lunch with the President right now?
[00:40:21.014 --> 00:40:22.035]  Is that going on right now?
[00:40:23.356 --> 00:40:24.136]  What do you think?
[00:40:24.337 --> 00:40:25.437]  Maybe we should just take off.
[00:40:25.918 --> 00:40:30.341]  What do you think Kanye West is eating right now with President Donald Trump?
[00:40:31.162 --> 00:40:33.023]  Is it a McDonald's hamburger?
[00:40:34.104 --> 00:40:34.765]  Is it a
[00:40:36.044 --> 00:40:37.845]  Well done steak with ketchup.
[00:40:40.486 --> 00:40:46.009]  Did President Trump hit the red alert Diet Coke button?
[00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:57.455]  You know, this is going to be interesting, actually, and I'll tell you what, because I've got a shocking clip from CNN last night.
[00:40:57.915 --> 00:40:58.875]  Truly shocking, folks.
[00:40:59.396 --> 00:41:00.036]  Truly shocking.
[00:41:00.556 --> 00:41:01.717]  In fact, how long is that clip?
[00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:08.017]  Let's go to this clip now.
[00:41:08.757 --> 00:41:17.283]  As Kanye West is having lunch with the President of the United States, listen to what was said on CNN last night about Kanye West.
[00:41:17.343 --> 00:41:19.265]  This is honestly next level, folks.
[00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:23.448]  I mean, again, where does the left go from here?
[00:41:24.068 --> 00:41:25.269]  They keep lowering the bar.
[00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:29.532]  Listen to CNN last night, a panel on Kanye West.
[00:41:30.745 --> 00:41:32.747]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:41:32.767 --> 00:41:33.808]  What?
[00:41:34.009 --> 00:41:40.075]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it, and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[00:41:41.937 --> 00:41:42.718]  That's funny to them.
[00:41:42.958 --> 00:41:44.160]  Just looking at Scott's face.
[00:41:45.914 --> 00:41:47.736]  Yeah, he can't believe how racist you are!
[00:41:48.356 --> 00:41:51.098]  Trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[00:41:51.498 --> 00:41:54.721]  They've had it with him, and he's an attention whore like the president.
[00:41:55.101 --> 00:41:58.204]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[00:41:58.264 --> 00:42:01.586]  He's the token Negro of the Trump administration.
[00:42:02.007 --> 00:42:05.649]  This is ridiculous, and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[00:42:05.709 --> 00:42:07.451]  He clearly has issues.
[00:42:07.751 --> 00:42:09.052]  He's already been hospitalized.
[00:42:09.392 --> 00:42:10.693]  He's already been hospitalized.
[00:42:11.794 --> 00:42:12.455]  Hospitalized.
[00:42:14.551 --> 00:42:17.432]  Did you hear the racism on CNN last night, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:42:17.872 --> 00:42:20.312]  They called Kanye West a token Negro.
[00:42:22.073 --> 00:42:26.714]  This is what happened when the Negroes go off the plantation of the Democrat Party.
[00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:29.774]  They say, come back here, token Negro!
[00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:32.235]  Look at that Negro, he can't read!
[00:42:32.255 --> 00:42:35.736]  Those aren't my words, that was on CNN last night!
[00:42:36.156 --> 00:42:40.977]  But they'll print a story about me, covering what CNN said, and say I'm a racist!
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:45.380]  I don't
[00:43:07.295 --> 00:43:09.978]  Christine Ford is questioned about her fear of flying.
[00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:13.583]  And her boyfriend, former boyfriend, said she was never afraid of flights.
[00:43:13.783 --> 00:43:17.067]  And I sat there and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test.
[00:43:17.087 --> 00:43:17.448]  Here it is.
[00:43:18.309 --> 00:43:20.772]  May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington?
[00:43:23.148 --> 00:43:24.129]  In an airplane.
[00:43:25.891 --> 00:43:34.039]  I asked that because it's been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying.
[00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:35.220]  Is that true?
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:43.067]  I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request.
[00:43:43.307 --> 00:43:47.171]  That was certainly what I was hoping was to avoid having to get on an airplane, but
[00:43:48.189 --> 00:43:54.211]  I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane.
[00:43:54.891 --> 00:44:05.473]  I also saw on your CV that you list the following interests of certain travel and you in parentheses put Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific Islands and French Polynesia.
[00:44:05.753 --> 00:44:07.114]  Have you been all to those places?
[00:44:07.654 --> 00:44:08.114]  Correct.
[00:44:08.714 --> 00:44:09.454]  By airplane?
[00:44:09.814 --> 00:44:10.074]  Yes.
[00:44:10.675 --> 00:44:12.715]  Oh, but she couldn't fly the week before.
[00:44:12.815 --> 00:44:13.875]  She was afraid.
[00:44:14.215 --> 00:44:14.916]  I'm afraid.
[00:44:14.936 --> 00:44:16.176]  I'm a little baby.
[00:44:18.061 --> 00:44:28.886]  I work in implanted memories at a DARPA facility and do stuff for the Defense Language School and everything, but I, my whole family's in the CIA and I level, but I'm a sweet little lady.
[00:44:29.206 --> 00:44:30.987]  Oh, you make me talk like a baby.
[00:44:31.207 --> 00:44:32.108]  So, continuing.
[00:44:32.188 --> 00:44:38.291]  Here she is, Ford explains why she decided to take a polygraph test, and now they've had the FBI guy on Fox.
[00:44:38.431 --> 00:44:39.091]  We've got the clip.
[00:44:39.131 --> 00:44:40.132]  He gave her two questions.
[00:44:40.152 --> 00:44:43.994]  You give someone 20 plus questions if it's a real one, and still it's not conclusive.
[00:44:44.094 --> 00:44:46.495]  A real polygraph has over a hundred questions.
[00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:49.979]  After she put together the statement and then you interviewed her, these are the two questions you asked.
[00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.921]  Is any part of your statement false?
[00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:52.702]  She said no.
[00:44:52.963 --> 00:44:54.525]  Did you make up any part of your statement?
[00:44:54.565 --> 00:44:55.526]  Her answer was no.
[00:44:55.546 --> 00:45:02.094]  I don't know a lot about polygraph tests, but to me, reading this from the outside, it seemed that I would expect many more questions.
[00:45:02.174 --> 00:45:03.896]  Is this standard to just have the two?
[00:45:04.757 --> 00:45:05.057]  It is.
[00:45:05.357 --> 00:45:07.718]  And, um, you know, especially when you do victims.
[00:45:07.738 --> 00:45:09.758]  It's very rare in law enforcement.
[00:45:09.778 --> 00:45:13.059]  I spent most of my, obviously, my career in working with the FBI.
[00:45:13.639 --> 00:45:16.439]  You don't normally give polygraph tests to victims.
[00:45:16.579 --> 00:45:18.280]  You represent victims, okay?
[00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:28.322]  And you believe them, unless you have some corroborating evidence that there's something about this person's allegations that you found some corroborate that you don't believe.
[00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:29.762]  But she got two.
[00:45:30.788 --> 00:45:32.169]  Let's continue.
[00:45:32.429 --> 00:45:38.695]  I was happy to undergo the polygraph test, although I found it extremely stressful.
[00:45:40.336 --> 00:45:41.958]  Much longer than I anticipated.
[00:45:43.439 --> 00:45:45.441]  I told my whole life story, I felt like.
[00:45:45.741 --> 00:45:47.602]  I endured it.
[00:45:47.622 --> 00:45:48.363]  I was fine.
[00:45:48.983 --> 00:45:52.266]  Have you ever taken any other polygraphs in your life?
[00:45:52.906 --> 00:45:53.206]  Never.
[00:45:53.507 --> 00:46:02.574]  Have you ever had discussions with anyone besides your attorney on how to take a polygraph?
[00:46:03.934 --> 00:46:04.274]  Never.
[00:46:05.215 --> 00:46:08.078]  Oh no, she just knows about mind control, not about polygraphs!
[00:46:08.478 --> 00:46:12.181]  Just any sort of tips or anything like that.
[00:46:12.522 --> 00:46:13.082]  No, no.
[00:46:13.583 --> 00:46:17.506]  No, I was scared of the test itself.
[00:46:17.646 --> 00:46:18.907]  Oh, she's scared!
[00:46:18.927 --> 00:46:19.708]  Hit pause.
[00:46:20.028 --> 00:46:21.430]  She's like, I'm scared!
[00:46:21.450 --> 00:46:23.431]  I'm scared I can't fly!
[00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:25.013]  I can't in my little shell!
[00:46:25.313 --> 00:46:32.276]  But the reviews in college said she's the worst, she's vindictive, she's lazy, she's horrible, she's into group hypnosis, brainwashing.
[00:46:32.336 --> 00:46:34.497]  But she's a scared little girl!
[00:46:34.577 --> 00:46:36.598]  I mean, who do you think they're gonna get to go up and say this?
[00:46:36.918 --> 00:46:40.880]  A mind control doctor hooked into DARPA, the whole family's in the CIA, I rest my case.
[00:46:45.782 --> 00:46:48.463]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:46:58.984 --> 00:47:02.907]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:47:03.348 --> 00:47:07.310]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:11.073]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:47:14.396 --> 00:47:17.518]  You want to see what goes on at CNN when nobody's watching?
[00:47:18.338 --> 00:47:20.320]  Which is pretty much all the time.
[00:47:23.404 --> 00:47:25.685]  You want to know what goes on at CNN when nobody's watching?
[00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:36.451]  Total, unhinged commentary that's now gone beyond just the Trump hatred and the Trump derangement syndrome.
[00:47:37.071 --> 00:47:51.079]  Now, anybody, if you show support for Trump or don't come out as absolutely, totally against Trump, you're now anything under the sun that they can accuse you of or say you are.
[00:47:52.407 --> 00:47:57.269]  Whatever the insult is, it's all fair game for CNN.
[00:47:57.809 --> 00:48:00.730]  Listen to CNN last night.
[00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:03.751]  Of course, Kanye West having lunch with President Trump today.
[00:48:03.771 --> 00:48:05.032]  Oh no!
[00:48:06.052 --> 00:48:08.753]  Oh, look at President Trump helping the black community.
[00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:15.516]  Look at President Trump meeting with Kim Kardashian to free a woman from prison for a small drug sentence.
[00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:25.856]  Look at Kanye West, that madman wants to meet with Trump, the racist, who's doing more for the black community than any Democrats have done for 50 years!
[00:48:26.137 --> 00:48:26.777]  Unbelievable!
[00:48:27.357 --> 00:48:29.999]  Kanye, get back on your plantation!
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.521]  Kanye, put your shackles back on!
[00:48:33.936 --> 00:48:39.521]  So let's go to CNN, Bakari Sellers, Tara Setmire, and Scott Jennings.
[00:48:39.821 --> 00:48:41.142]  I don't think Jennings weighed in on this one.
[00:48:41.583 --> 00:48:45.806]  I think we're just hearing Bakari Sellers and Tara Setmire in this segment with Don Lemon.
[00:48:46.287 --> 00:48:47.848]  All black people, mind you.
[00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:52.212]  So it's okay for them to be racist against the black man, I suppose.
[00:48:53.954 --> 00:48:54.574]  And the white man.
[00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:59.739]  But if I said anything close to what these people said,
[00:49:01.279 --> 00:49:01.760]  You know what?
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.521]  Oh, I'm not even going to go down that road!
[00:49:05.622 --> 00:49:22.132]  But you know, everyone knows, if I would have said anything like what Bakari Sellers and Tara Setmire are about to say in this segment, I would be, I would never be allowed to go on anywhere again, if I was on CNN that is.
[00:49:22.152 --> 00:49:25.894]  It would just be total destruction of my career.
[00:49:26.274 --> 00:49:27.715]  Listen to the CNN panel.
[00:49:30.114 --> 00:49:39.787]  Who saw Kanye West go on the Underground Railroad with Harriet Tubman and escape slavery, and CNN said, Kanye!
[00:49:40.308 --> 00:49:42.070]  Get your ass back here, boy!
[00:49:42.791 --> 00:49:46.657]  Except they said it a little bit differently to your CNN last night.
[00:49:48.171 --> 00:49:50.192]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:49:50.952 --> 00:49:51.692]  Oh my God!
[00:49:51.732 --> 00:49:54.273]  We have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it.
[00:49:54.293 --> 00:49:55.354]  That's Bakari Sellers.
[00:49:55.394 --> 00:49:57.154]  Let's start that again.
[00:49:57.435 --> 00:50:01.236]  Listen to what Bakari Sellers says about Kanye West.
[00:50:01.916 --> 00:50:09.839]  Oh, little Bakari Sellers is upset that Kanye West got free and he's still a slave.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:11.840]  Isn't that funny?
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.421]  Oh my gosh, isn't that funny?
[00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:16.622]  Kanye West broke the shackles.
[00:50:18.021 --> 00:50:20.623]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:50:20.683 --> 00:50:32.791]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it, and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[00:50:32.872 --> 00:50:34.353]  And now they laugh.
[00:50:34.373 --> 00:50:34.933]  Like, this is a joke.
[00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:50.591]  Yeah, real funny Don Lemon!
[00:51:18.595 --> 00:51:20.316]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:20.336 --> 00:51:21.416]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:21.436 --> 00:51:23.037]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:23.057 --> 00:51:24.057]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:24.077 --> 00:51:25.498]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:25.518 --> 00:51:26.598]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:26.618 --> 00:51:28.159]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:29.279]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:29.299 --> 00:51:30.360]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.580]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.381]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:33.401 --> 00:51:34.802]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:34.822 --> 00:51:36.102]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:36.122 --> 00:51:37.603]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:37.643 --> 00:51:39.263]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:39.303 --> 00:51:40.684]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:40.704 --> 00:51:42.905]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:42.925 --> 00:51:44.426]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[00:51:44.446 --> 00:51:45.486]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes
[00:51:45.586 --> 00:51:55.508]  They're the black people that are still on the slave plantation, watching Kanye West run to freedom, telling them, you don't have to be slaves anymore!
[00:51:56.709 --> 00:51:57.249]  Come on!
[00:51:57.849 --> 00:51:59.229]  And they rebuke him.
[00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.191]  And then what do you think this is going to do to Kanye West's attitude?
[00:52:05.371 --> 00:52:05.991]  You fools.
[00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:10.872]  I mean, the left is so destructive right now.
[00:52:14.192 --> 00:52:15.453]  I can't imagine where it goes from here.
[00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:18.674]  We all know where it goes from here, folks.
[00:52:24.717 --> 00:52:25.298]  It's not good.
[00:52:27.038 --> 00:52:32.181]  But we'll know who to look at and who to blame when it all calms down.
[00:52:33.842 --> 00:52:40.225]  And it'll be the gentleman sitting behind me at CNN
[00:52:41.561 --> 00:52:50.105]  That have been inciting violence in this country ever since Trump announced he's running for president.
[00:52:51.085 --> 00:52:54.587]  They have been building this up ever since Trump announced.
[00:52:58.288 --> 00:53:08.173]  And if they really think they're gonna win in November with rhetoric like this, doesn't that just tell you how insane they really are?
[00:53:09.613 --> 00:53:11.014]  Let's go out to the phone lines
[00:53:12.227 --> 00:53:13.048]  Let's go to Lawrence.
[00:53:14.629 --> 00:53:15.249]  Go ahead, Lawrence.
[00:53:15.269 --> 00:53:15.830]  You're on the air.
[00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:16.810]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:17.211]  Go ahead.
[00:53:18.411 --> 00:53:19.172]  Owen, it's a pleasure.
[00:53:19.412 --> 00:53:19.892]  How you doing?
[00:53:20.353 --> 00:53:20.953]  Thank you for calling.
[00:53:20.993 --> 00:53:21.514]  I'm doing fine.
[00:53:22.794 --> 00:53:23.155]  Excellent.
[00:53:24.015 --> 00:53:29.639]  You know, I don't even know where to start, but I'm just going to just shoot straight from the hip.
[00:53:29.739 --> 00:53:31.741]  I'm a black guy from Cleveland.
[00:53:32.421 --> 00:53:32.802]  All right.
[00:53:32.902 --> 00:53:38.546]  And I've been following politics, what's been going on.
[00:53:39.346 --> 00:53:41.788]  And just to speak generalistically, because
[00:53:42.409 --> 00:53:47.832]  You know, I don't read, ha ha ha ha.
[00:53:47.852 --> 00:53:48.333]  Yeah, right.
[00:53:48.353 --> 00:53:53.096]  If you're not a Democrat voter or a CNN audience and you're black, they just assume you don't read, right?
[00:53:53.116 --> 00:53:54.657]  That's right.
[00:53:55.317 --> 00:53:56.898]  Even though it's the exact opposite.
[00:53:57.999 --> 00:53:58.399]  That's right.
[00:53:58.699 --> 00:53:59.540]  That's exactly right.
[00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:07.465]  So, this Bakari, he should be ashamed of himself because it is Kanye West's constitutional right.
[00:54:08.248 --> 00:54:21.957]  Or it probably isn't, but it's Kanye West's constitutional right to choose what he wants to select as his spokesperson or his thought process or the politics or policies that he wants to choose.
[00:54:22.417 --> 00:54:31.583]  And to say that this is what happens when Negroes don't read is a slap in the face to his rights and to himself, and a slap in the face to all others in the Midwest.
[00:54:31.643 --> 00:54:34.245]  And by the way, there's a growing sentiment
[00:54:34.915 --> 00:54:49.651]  And you know this from your research and your studies, but there's a growing sentiment in the Black community that they've been, and I don't want to cuss, but they've been really done wrong by the Democratic Party, and we know it.
[00:54:49.671 --> 00:54:56.037]  And the best thing that I ever heard Donald Trump ever say was, bye-bye, see you again in four years.
[00:54:56.117 --> 00:54:57.579]  That was a wake-up call to Black
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:58.961]  The black community.
[00:54:59.461 --> 00:55:01.682]  And we took that and we ran with it because we knew it.
[00:55:02.123 --> 00:55:04.544]  And I'm here in the Midwest and I've seen it.
[00:55:04.604 --> 00:55:18.093]  I've seen black people not vote for Hillary Clinton, not only because of the Bill Clinton policies, but because of the overall tiredness that everyone has for politics in general.
[00:55:18.213 --> 00:55:22.756]  And we have a straight shooter, a person who's just speaking from the heart, Donald Trump.
[00:55:23.376 --> 00:55:25.318]  And it's impressive for us.
[00:55:25.378 --> 00:55:27.459]  So and go back to your point.
[00:55:28.969 --> 00:55:29.390]  I think so.
[00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:40.061]  I think so.
[00:56:01.628 --> 00:56:05.709]  Yeah, his message is a message of choice and love more than anything.
[00:56:06.309 --> 00:56:09.790]  But Lawrence, I mean, I'm just trying to get this through my head.
[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:16.872]  How does a black audience member of CNN watch that segment and not be totally disgusted?
[00:56:18.352 --> 00:56:21.813]  Most of them are brainwashed, Owen.
[00:56:21.833 --> 00:56:24.054]  But still, that's like a slap in the face!
[00:56:25.374 --> 00:56:25.534]  Yeah.
[00:56:26.397 --> 00:56:26.877]  Yeah, man.
[00:56:27.257 --> 00:56:30.399]  I mean, they're mainly brainwashed.
[00:56:30.499 --> 00:56:32.560]  They go to these colleges.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.021]  The colleges don't want them to think freely.
[00:56:35.041 --> 00:56:47.326]  And also, there's incentive given to think the way that everybody is thinking at these college campuses, at these certain events, and they want handouts.
[00:56:48.186 --> 00:56:53.787]  Bakari Sellers, Bakari Sellers Lawrence, Bakari Sellers said that you're illiterate and a token black man.
[00:56:54.027 --> 00:56:56.248]  Bakari Sellers said that about you last night on CNN.
[00:56:56.508 --> 00:57:00.508]  Bakari Sellers said that about every black Trump supporter in America.
[00:57:00.769 --> 00:57:05.129]  Bakari Sellers said you're illiterate and a token black person from Tara Setmire.
[00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:08.150]  I mean, Lawrence, I'm just stunned.
[00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:12.971]  I don't see how they maintain any audience with rhetoric like that.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.661]  That's so true, man.
[00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:19.022]  But, I mean, there's people out there that's eating that up, man.
[00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:19.703]  They love it.
[00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:20.863]  That's sad.
[00:57:20.943 --> 00:57:21.784]  That's just sad to me.
[00:57:21.804 --> 00:57:22.665]  It's just sad.
[00:57:22.685 --> 00:57:26.767]  Again, it's slaves watching the slaves leave the plantation.
[00:57:27.308 --> 00:57:31.130]  They could leave too, but being mad that they're free while they're still slaves.
[00:57:32.991 --> 00:57:34.212]  You are confident.
[00:57:34.252 --> 00:57:34.973]  You are unique.
[00:57:43.667 --> 00:57:45.269]  You are inspiring.
[00:57:48.133 --> 00:57:50.776]  And today, you will look your beautiful best.
[00:57:53.339 --> 00:57:54.340]  Instantly ageless.
[00:57:54.921 --> 00:58:00.448]  An age-defying microcream that in less than two minutes restores the youthful appearance of your skin.
[00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:07.734]  Created to diminish the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, pores, and puffiness under the eyes.
[00:58:09.055 --> 00:58:09.595]  No needles.
[00:58:10.256 --> 00:58:10.796]  No pain.
[00:58:11.597 --> 00:58:13.878]  Just a happier, younger-looking you.
[00:58:15.039 --> 00:58:17.101]  To use, simply massage the packet.
[00:58:18.042 --> 00:58:21.525]  Dispense a small drop and lightly pat a thin layer to targeted areas.
[00:58:22.589 --> 00:58:26.870]  Leave the product damp on your skin and remain expressionless for two minutes while it dries.
[00:58:27.651 --> 00:58:30.071]  And if you missed a spot, it's easy to reapply.
[00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:35.033]  Or if you happen to apply too much, wet a cotton swab and gently remove any residue.
[00:58:35.673 --> 00:58:38.774]  Apply oil-free cosmetics and finish getting ready as usual.
[00:58:39.214 --> 00:58:40.074]  It's that simple.
[00:58:40.514 --> 00:58:49.497]  I've probably noticed in the past five years that my eyes have gained a lot of fine lines, wrinkles, my curls have gotten deeper.
[00:58:53.104 --> 00:58:53.384]  Wow.
[00:58:53.544 --> 00:58:56.546]  I was hoping for five years, but that's like what my eyes looked like ten years ago.
[00:58:57.627 --> 00:58:59.288]  That is really cool!
[00:59:00.188 --> 00:59:00.548]  Wrinkle?
[00:59:01.169 --> 00:59:01.489]  Gone?
[00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:03.370]  It's easy.
[00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:05.131]  Just put it on your finger and go.
[00:59:05.171 --> 00:59:07.673]  Now I wish I had more down here because I can still see one wrinkle.
[00:59:07.713 --> 00:59:08.293]  It's bugging me.
[00:59:09.253 --> 00:59:10.514]  I am a little bit emotional.
[00:59:11.075 --> 00:59:21.841]  Turning 40 I didn't think would be a big deal to me, but that looks like the me that I feel like inside instead of what I see when I look in the mirror.
[00:59:36.988 --> 00:59:40.124]  Receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[00:59:59.995 --> 01:00:09.946]  Last night, CNN had a panel in which they wanted to let black Trump supporters know exactly what they thought about them.
[01:00:10.847 --> 01:00:21.799]  Here's Bakari Sellers and Tara Setmire on Don Lemonhead's show last night on CNN, just letting all black Trump supporters know what they think about you.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.683]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[01:00:26.966 --> 01:00:33.016]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it, and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[01:00:34.919 --> 01:00:35.660]  They think that's funny.
[01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:37.303]  Just looking at Scott's face.
[01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:44.016]  Listen, black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[01:00:44.436 --> 01:00:47.679]  They've had it with him, and he's an attention whore like the president.
[01:00:48.039 --> 01:00:51.162]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[01:00:51.202 --> 01:00:54.524]  He's the token Negro of the Trump administration.
[01:00:54.945 --> 01:00:58.607]  This is ridiculous, and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[01:00:58.667 --> 01:01:00.389]  He clearly has issues.
[01:01:00.689 --> 01:01:01.990]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:03.631]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:01:03.931 --> 01:01:08.355]  You know, the truth is that nobody takes you seriously.
[01:01:10.703 --> 01:01:12.725]  The truth is that you don't read books.
[01:01:14.166 --> 01:01:21.332]  The truth is that you're still a slave to the Democrat Party that fought for slavery.
[01:01:23.133 --> 01:01:33.442]  Kanye West left the plantation, freed his mind, freed himself from the shackles, and you're sitting there watching him jealous because you haven't figured it out yet.
[01:01:36.244 --> 01:01:37.085]  That's all it is.
[01:01:39.292 --> 01:01:40.754]  But make no mistake about it, folks.
[01:01:40.794 --> 01:01:46.160]  CNN just let every black person out there that supports Trump know how they feel about them.
[01:01:47.521 --> 01:01:49.924]  They want you back on their plantation.
[01:01:50.224 --> 01:01:52.607]  You're not allowed to think for yourself.
[01:01:53.028 --> 01:01:54.049]  And just imagine.
[01:01:55.691 --> 01:01:59.996]  Now see, if I say something negative about Kanye West,
[01:02:02.555 --> 01:02:07.116]  All the Kanye West fans immediately come to his defense and attack me.
[01:02:07.616 --> 01:02:08.776]  Because they love Kanye.
[01:02:09.036 --> 01:02:13.957]  Doesn't matter what the political spectrum of the context is, there is none.
[01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:21.198]  If I say something negative about Kanye West, Kanye West fans immediately are there to stand up for him and attack me.
[01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:26.779]  But if CNN says that about Kanye West, he's a token negro?
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:29.540]  He's a negro that doesn't read?
[01:02:31.161 --> 01:02:32.561]  Where are the Kanye West fans?
[01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:40.444]  Oh, they don't attack the left because they've all gone mentally insane.
[01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:42.424]  They're all on the plantation together.
[01:02:42.484 --> 01:02:43.985]  They're all in the cult.
[01:02:47.225 --> 01:02:49.026]  So they're allowed to insult Kanye West.
[01:02:50.799 --> 01:02:54.041]  But if I said something negative about Kanye West, I would be attacked 24-7.
[01:02:54.341 --> 01:03:08.927]  In fact, I just put out a tweet of the Make America Great Again red hat that he wears, and I tweeted, put your Superman cape on in reference to what he said, and I got attacked by all the Kanye fans!
[01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:13.710]  Oh, it's so great.
[01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:16.611]  Remember when Kanye West wrote the song, Jesus Walks?
[01:03:18.666 --> 01:03:21.788]  What was the verse they said you can write about anything except for Jesus?
[01:03:25.631 --> 01:03:28.533]  They said that if you're black you can stand for anything except for Trump.
[01:03:29.253 --> 01:03:33.216]  They said if you're in the music industry you can sing about anything and rap about anything except for Jesus.
[01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:34.837]  What did Kanye do?
[01:03:36.138 --> 01:03:38.319]  He wrote a Top 40 song called Jesus Walks.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:40.561]  He supported President Trump.
[01:03:42.762 --> 01:03:46.805]  Let's squeeze in a quick call from Alex in Michigan, Alex Fireaway.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:49.720]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.621]  It's good to talk to you again.
[01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:53.441]  Go ahead.
[01:03:54.022 --> 01:03:58.723]  I have a couple ideas that could save InfoWars if you'll let me have them at the end here, or now.
[01:03:58.783 --> 01:03:59.263]  It's up to you.
[01:03:59.543 --> 01:04:00.504]  You've got 40 seconds.
[01:04:02.224 --> 01:04:02.524]  Oh, okay.
[01:04:02.684 --> 01:04:09.907]  What Alex should do is, he doesn't need to sell to hardcore fans on, like, Survival Shield X2 and all the ingredients in the products.
[01:04:10.567 --> 01:04:12.827]  Like, we know those are good ingredients, you know what I mean?
[01:04:12.867 --> 01:04:17.789]  So, what Alex should do is start selling in bulk, like the bulk herbs people want.
[01:04:18.442 --> 01:04:20.563]  Like myself, I make a lot of teas with herbs.
[01:04:20.643 --> 01:04:26.646]  I buy in bulk from other places that I wish I could buy from in force, but you know what I mean?
[01:04:27.087 --> 01:04:31.969]  No, you know, look, we it's a great idea and we get a lot of great ideas about what to sell.
[01:04:32.009 --> 01:04:35.251]  And but the problem is and I'm not I mean, Alex, you have a great idea.
[01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:39.393]  It's just we've got thousands of great ideas and 100 different things we're trying to do.
[01:04:39.453 --> 01:04:41.414]  So it's tough to just take on a project.

[01:06:03.362 --> 01:06:12.488]  So we just had the last caller call in with a suggestion on something to sell at InfoWarsStore.com and we appreciate all ideas.

[01:06:47.556 --> 01:06:48.617]  That's right.

[01:07:00.906 --> 01:07:03.448]  Survival Shield X2, another supplement on its last run.
[01:07:03.868 --> 01:07:05.969]  Ultimate Bone Broth, the real red pill.
[01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:07.690]  Knockout Sleep Aid.
[01:07:08.071 --> 01:07:08.751]  Bodies.

[01:07:15.915 --> 01:07:16.115]  50% off.
[01:07:16.135 --> 01:07:16.776]  This is unheard of.

[01:07:21.439 --> 01:07:21.899]  But you know what?
[01:07:23.422 --> 01:07:27.504]  You know what, 50% off, that's not even, that's really only halfway there.
[01:07:27.944 --> 01:07:28.644]  Pun not intended.
[01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:31.105]  That's really only halfway there, the 50% off.
[01:07:31.525 --> 01:07:33.346]  Let's just go ahead and go free shipping too.
[01:07:34.126 --> 01:07:34.626]  Let's do that.

[01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:10.295]  Now, we heard from Alex earlier.
[01:09:12.056 --> 01:09:15.238]  Alex is working on a report right now and
[01:09:17.634 --> 01:09:31.858]  You know when Alex gets a tip on something or some exclusive intel on something that he's going to make sure to report it properly and get it out there though.
[01:09:34.438 --> 01:09:36.179]  Just so you can know what's going on.
[01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:41.000]  But I'm not going to get too much into it because I'm going to let Alex do it.
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:46.121]  And we've already put some clues out there, but Alex is working on a report.
[01:09:46.161 --> 01:09:49.882]  It'll either air by the end of today or tomorrow on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:51.723 --> 01:09:58.265]  And, um, well, it's about the 2020 presidential election.
[01:09:58.465 --> 01:09:59.346]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:00.146 --> 01:10:02.126]  And it's some big breaking news.
[01:10:07.188 --> 01:10:09.509]  Also, Alex is going to be live tonight.
[01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:19.720]  As we kick off our extended band coverage of the 2018 midterm election, Alex Jones goes live tonight at 8 p.m.
[01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:20.381]  to 10 p.m.
[01:10:20.421 --> 01:10:20.761]  Central.
[01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:27.690]  We will be doing this weeknights leading up to the November 6th red wave.
[01:10:28.632 --> 01:10:41.857]  Which is going to be massively historic and the breakdown, the mental and physical breakdown of the left is going to continue, but we will have all the live coverage weeknights starting tonight, 8 to 10 p.m.
[01:10:41.897 --> 01:10:45.679]  Central with Alex Jones, our extended live coverage.
[01:10:46.299 --> 01:10:47.839]  And I'll just go ahead and say this, folks.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:57.103]  What we're doing right now is basically we're dipping our toes in the water to see if we're ready to expand.
[01:10:58.393 --> 01:11:05.181]  So Alex, with this extended coverage, is dipping his toe in the water to see if we can actually, we have the capacity to expand right now.
[01:11:05.241 --> 01:11:12.010]  Now that means we need more crew, which means we need more funding, that means, you know, we gotta hire more people.
[01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:20.876]  Which means we need more funding, which means we're going to see what kind of funding we can get from this massive sale at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:11:21.577 --> 01:11:26.800]  We're going to see how the reception is to this extended live coverage, 8 to 10 p.m.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.341]  weeknights.
[01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:28.582]  Are you going to share it?
[01:11:28.662 --> 01:11:29.522]  Are you going to talk about it?
[01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:30.383]  Are you going to share the links?
[01:11:30.403 --> 01:11:31.664]  Are you going to tell your friends and family?
[01:11:31.684 --> 01:11:33.185]  Are we going to get a lot of traffic?
[01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:34.265]  Are you going to fund us?
[01:11:34.305 --> 01:11:40.349]  Are you going to go to InfoWarsTore.com and supply us with the funds to hire new crew so that we can expand our live coverage?
[01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:42.451]  And if the answer to those questions are yes,
[01:11:42.671 --> 01:11:45.233]  Because you know where we go from here.
[01:11:46.534 --> 01:11:47.455]  But that's where we're at.
[01:11:47.735 --> 01:11:49.116]  You already know about the censorship.
[01:11:49.436 --> 01:11:52.719]  You already know about the attacks trying to stop us from getting financing.
[01:11:52.779 --> 01:11:54.040]  You already know about all the lawsuits.
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.461]  It's all designed to take us down.
[01:11:56.181 --> 01:12:03.707]  But thank God and thank you for making sure that InfoWars is still on the air every day and we've been able to expand.
[01:12:03.747 --> 01:12:04.487]  But it's been tough.
[01:12:05.228 --> 01:12:07.570]  So now we're looking at things and we're saying, okay.
[01:12:08.595 --> 01:12:10.116]  Do we have the capacity to expand?
[01:12:10.437 --> 01:12:11.638]  Will our audience fund us?
[01:12:11.938 --> 01:12:15.741]  Will our audience tune in if we actually start another live broadcast?
[01:12:16.462 --> 01:12:21.766]  So all those questions are going to be asked and answered leading up to the midterms, and you have all the answers.
[01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:24.609]  All right, let's squeeze in a quick phone call here.
[01:12:24.749 --> 01:12:26.591]  Darian calling in from Wisconsin.
[01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:27.711]  Go ahead, Darian.
[01:12:28.652 --> 01:12:30.134]  Hi Owen, how are you?
[01:12:30.374 --> 01:12:31.094]  I'm great, thank you.
[01:12:32.536 --> 01:12:35.318]  You know, I really don't want to focus on the problems, okay?
[01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:36.339]  I hear a lot about
[01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:39.593]  You know, the insanity and all of this stuff.
[01:12:39.633 --> 01:12:42.155]  What I'm not hearing a lot of is the solutions.
[01:12:43.195 --> 01:12:46.957]  You know, when Trump got up in his speech, I think a lot of people missed the dream part.
[01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.258]  He talked a lot about dreams.
[01:12:49.819 --> 01:12:53.861]  You know, the reason we're in the state we're in is because we've lost our dreams.
[01:12:54.201 --> 01:12:54.941]  We don't create.
[01:12:55.181 --> 01:12:55.922]  We don't innovate.
[01:12:56.222 --> 01:12:56.942]  We don't design.
[01:12:57.562 --> 01:12:58.303]  We've been oppressed.
[01:12:58.363 --> 01:12:58.923]  We've been kicked.
[01:12:58.983 --> 01:12:59.583]  We've been beaten.
[01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:06.367]  And the reason our enemy is so successful is because they're united in a horrible nightmare.
[01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:07.802]  Yeah, it's a dream.
[01:13:08.062 --> 01:13:08.823]  I call it a nightmare.
[01:13:09.763 --> 01:13:12.564]  And they work together, and they have their hands in everything that matters.
[01:13:13.405 --> 01:13:16.306]  I started a business up here in Eau Claire, at the Eastridge Center.
[01:13:16.786 --> 01:13:18.087]  I'm next to medical doctors.
[01:13:18.147 --> 01:13:19.748]  I've got my hands in the medical industry.
[01:13:19.988 --> 01:13:20.928]  I'm a software engineer.
[01:13:20.988 --> 01:13:21.828]  I'm also a scientist.
[01:13:22.329 --> 01:13:22.569]  Okay?
[01:13:23.549 --> 01:13:24.950]  And I have been calling businesses.
[01:13:27.091 --> 01:13:30.572]  In 2004, when I did hardware, it was a wonderful market.
[01:13:31.213 --> 01:13:33.033]  But all our manufacturing has gone to China.
[01:13:33.694 --> 01:13:34.934]  All our cell phones are in China.
[01:13:34.954 --> 01:13:36.575]  AMD and Intel, they went to China.
[01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:38.864]  And now businesses are desperate.
[01:13:39.745 --> 01:13:46.551]  So what I did, and this is just kind of a blueprint, is I started calling businesses and I started going, how can I help you?
[01:13:48.512 --> 01:13:54.317]  And the way I'm conquering this is I'm putting together a big B2B and all the businesses are going to be networked.
[01:13:54.758 --> 01:13:56.179]  And when I have a few hundred businesses,
[01:13:56.843 --> 01:14:00.907]  Then I'm going to approach them and I'm going to say, hey, let's make our own semiconductors.
[01:14:01.327 --> 01:14:02.448]  Let's make our own technology.
[01:14:02.468 --> 01:14:04.209]  Then we don't have to order from China.
[01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:08.533]  One person can't do it alone.
[01:14:08.553 --> 01:14:09.494]  You're 100 percent right.
[01:14:09.514 --> 01:14:10.575]  You have to network.
[01:14:11.696 --> 01:14:20.964]  And there needs to be, though, I think that there needs to be some sort of trend or, you know, campaign that's made in America.
[01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:23.106]  You know, that needs to be something that people look
[01:14:23.749 --> 01:14:26.350]  When they're shopping and consuming, was it made in America?
[01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:27.390]  Is that made in America?
[01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:29.071]  Is this good made in America?
[01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:36.734]  I feel like just even that little consciousness to pay attention to that could be a drastic sea change as well.
[01:14:37.234 --> 01:14:39.675]  Yeah, you're iodine not being able to do that anymore.
[01:14:40.236 --> 01:14:40.936]  It's horrible.
[01:14:41.156 --> 01:14:42.817]  I wanted to distribute it from you guys.
[01:14:42.877 --> 01:14:48.099]  I wanted to approach you guys and start literally putting it up in my storefront here because I've been doing cancer research.
[01:14:48.479 --> 01:14:51.600]  By next year, I have approached several medical doctors.
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.341]  I may have an effective treatment.
[01:14:54.045 --> 01:14:59.491]  Well, I'll tell you what, one solution to taking control of our own destiny again and being able to create and build and
[01:15:18.126 --> 01:15:23.007]  Just be independent is lower taxes, having more money.
[01:15:23.348 --> 01:15:24.948]  That gives you more control of your destiny.
[01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:27.089]  Then you can go and fund projects.
[01:15:27.109 --> 01:15:29.149]  You can spend more time to try to create something.
[01:15:29.509 --> 01:15:31.190]  That's why Trump is cutting the taxes.
[01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:34.631]  That's why Trump is bringing the manufacturing back, the repatriation, everything.
[01:15:34.671 --> 01:15:38.532]  So people can have more money and be more independent and build things.
[01:15:38.832 --> 01:15:40.472]  That's what the globalists want to stop.
[01:15:45.282 --> 01:15:45.602]  I don't
[01:16:07.517 --> 01:16:10.198]  Christine Ford is questioned about her fear of flying.
[01:16:10.438 --> 01:16:13.800]  And her boyfriend, former boyfriend, said she was never afraid of flights.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.261]  And I sat there and saw her train her friend how to take a polygraph test.
[01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:17.681]  Here it is.
[01:16:18.502 --> 01:16:21.023]  May I ask, Dr. Ford, how did you get to Washington?
[01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:24.364]  In an airplane.
[01:16:24.704 --> 01:16:25.585]  Okay.
[01:16:26.105 --> 01:16:34.268]  I ask that because it's been reported by the press that you would not submit to an interview with the committee because of your fear of flying.
[01:16:34.788 --> 01:16:35.429]  Is that true?
[01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:43.281]  I was hoping that they would come to me, but then I realized that was an unrealistic request.
[01:16:43.481 --> 01:16:47.388]  That was certainly what I was hoping, was to avoid having to get on an airplane, but...
[01:16:48.388 --> 01:16:54.433]  I eventually was able to get up the gumption with the help of some friends and get on the plane.
[01:16:55.113 --> 01:17:05.701]  I also saw on your CV that you list the following interests of certain travel and you in parentheses put Hawaii, Costa Rica, South Pacific Islands and French Polynesia.
[01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:07.342]  Have you been all to those places?
[01:17:07.822 --> 01:17:08.323]  Correct.
[01:17:08.943 --> 01:17:09.684]  By airplane?
[01:17:10.024 --> 01:17:10.304]  Yes.
[01:17:10.905 --> 01:17:12.946]  Oh, but she couldn't fly the week before.
[01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:14.107]  She was afraid.
[01:17:14.427 --> 01:17:15.148]  I'm afraid.
[01:17:15.168 --> 01:17:16.389]  I'm a little baby.
[01:17:18.283 --> 01:17:29.108]  I work in Implanted Memories at a DARPA facility and do stuff for the Defense Language School and everything, but I, my whole family's in the CIA, and I level, but I'm a sweet little lady.
[01:17:29.188 --> 01:17:31.189]  Oh, you make me talk like a baby.
[01:17:31.409 --> 01:17:32.330]  So, continuing.
[01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.910]  Here she is.
[01:17:33.130 --> 01:17:38.513]  Ford explains why she decided to take a polygraph test, and now they've had the FBI guy on Fox.
[01:17:38.653 --> 01:17:39.313]  We've got the clip.
[01:17:39.333 --> 01:17:40.354]  He gave her two questions.
[01:17:40.374 --> 01:17:44.216]  You give someone 20-plus questions if it's a real one, and still it's not conclusive.
[01:17:44.296 --> 01:17:46.037]  A real polygraph has over 100 questions.
[01:17:47.057 --> 01:17:50.201]  After she put together the statement and then you interviewed her, these are the two questions you asked.
[01:17:50.581 --> 01:17:52.143]  Is any part of your statement false?
[01:17:52.343 --> 01:17:52.903]  She said no.
[01:17:53.184 --> 01:17:54.745]  Did you make up any part of your statement?
[01:17:54.785 --> 01:17:55.746]  Her answer was no.
[01:17:55.766 --> 01:18:02.314]  I don't know a lot about polygraph tests, but to me reading this from the outside it seemed that I would expect many more questions.
[01:18:02.394 --> 01:18:04.176]  Is this standard to just have the two?
[01:18:04.196 --> 01:18:04.256]  Yes.
[01:18:04.976 --> 01:18:07.917]  It is, and you know, especially when you do victims.
[01:18:07.957 --> 01:18:09.978]  It's very rare in law enforcement.
[01:18:09.998 --> 01:18:13.279]  I spent most of my, obviously, my career in working with the FBI.
[01:18:13.859 --> 01:18:16.660]  You don't normally give polygraph tests to victims.
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.500]  You represent victims, okay?
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:28.523]  And you believe them, unless you have some corroborating evidence that there's something about this person's allegations that you found some corroborate that you don't believe.
[01:18:29.084 --> 01:18:29.984]  But she got two.
[01:18:30.993 --> 01:18:32.634]  Let's continue.
[01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:38.899]  I was happy to undergo the polygraph test, although I found it extremely stressful.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:42.101]  Much longer than I anticipated.
[01:18:43.590 --> 01:18:47.691]  I told my whole life story, I felt like, but I endured it.
[01:18:47.711 --> 01:18:48.492]  It was fine.
[01:18:49.112 --> 01:18:52.413]  Have you ever taken any other polygraphs in your life?
[01:18:53.013 --> 01:18:53.353]  Never.
[01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:59.836]  Have you ever had discussions with anyone besides your attorney on how to take a polygraph?
[01:19:04.088 --> 01:19:05.289]  Never.
[01:19:05.349 --> 01:19:05.909]  Oh, no.
[01:19:05.949 --> 01:19:08.231]  She just knows about mind control, not about polygraphs.
[01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:12.254]  Just any sort of tips or anything like that.
[01:19:12.274 --> 01:19:12.935]  No, no.
[01:19:13.735 --> 01:19:17.638]  No, I was scared of the test itself.
[01:19:17.778 --> 01:19:19.039]  Oh, she's scared.
[01:19:19.079 --> 01:19:19.840]  Hit pause.
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:21.601]  She's like, I'm scared.
[01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:23.563]  I'm scared I can't fly.
[01:19:24.003 --> 01:19:25.164]  I can't in my little shell.
[01:19:25.464 --> 01:19:32.430]  But the reviews in college said she's the worst, she's vindictive, she's lazy, she's horrible, she's into group hypnosis, brainwashing.
[01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:34.652]  But she's a scared little girl!
[01:19:34.732 --> 01:19:36.754]  I mean, who do you think they're gonna get to go up and say this?
[01:19:37.074 --> 01:19:41.038]  A mind control doctor hooked into DARPA, the whole family's in the CIA, I rest my case.
[01:19:46.183 --> 01:19:48.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:01.571 --> 01:20:04.292]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:20:04.793 --> 01:20:09.355]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:20:09.615 --> 01:20:22.461]  Man, I'll tell ya, before I moved down here to Austin, Texas and started doing politics every day, I called a lot of fun, entertaining sporting events, buzzer beaters, you know, championships.
[01:20:24.041 --> 01:20:27.083]  But covering what's going on in America right now, I mean, there is
[01:20:28.706 --> 01:20:30.927]  Sports does not hold a candle, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:31.147 --> 01:20:38.530]  It just, it is so epic what's going on, and just seeing the moves, seeing what's on the horizon, it's all epic.
[01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:45.112]  Quickly, I'd be remiss if I didn't at least mention what's going on in Florida.
[01:20:45.192 --> 01:20:56.176]  Perhaps we'll cover it a little bit later on in the show once we get to a lot more calls and some of this news, but Hurricane Michael has made landfall, I believe, in Florida.
[01:20:58.303 --> 01:21:07.409]  It looks like it has just made landfall in Panama City and is moving northeast right now.
[01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:12.573]  It's just like everything else on news.
[01:21:12.713 --> 01:21:14.574]  They cover hurricanes and it's fake news.
[01:21:15.475 --> 01:21:16.956]  I'm not saying the hurricane is fake news.
[01:21:16.976 --> 01:21:19.237]  Obviously the hurricane is a serious issue here.
[01:21:19.257 --> 01:21:22.640]  The flooding has already been devastating in Florida.
[01:21:24.344 --> 01:21:26.609]  You notice how there was no build-up to this really?
[01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:28.552]  It just kind of like came out of nowhere.
[01:21:29.213 --> 01:21:31.177]  So, it's not even as big of a story.
[01:21:32.130 --> 01:21:44.398]  So, like, the last hurricane, I already forgot the name of it, huge buildup, weeks of buildup, days of buildup, and then it kind of came and, you know, it happened, but, uh, well, okay, we had like a week and a half of buildup, and it, you know, it was okay, but not the worst thing.
[01:21:44.918 --> 01:21:57.646]  And then Hurricane Michael, no buildup, uh, you know, nobody really talks about it, and then it's actually, like, a really bad one, and it's going to flood almost the entire northern panhandle, and it's like, well, okay, maybe it gets a little news coverage.
[01:21:57.666 --> 01:22:00.128]  So it's just like everything else in television news.
[01:22:00.908 --> 01:22:07.936]  It's all scripted, it's all fake, it's all for ratings, and, uh, you know, it's just... whatever.
[01:22:08.917 --> 01:22:19.890]  But, interestingly enough, some people are starting to understand how fake the news is on a much larger scale.
[01:22:21.238 --> 01:22:25.400]  Study, economic boom largely ignored as TV's Trump coverage hits 92% negative.
[01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.022]  So is it 91?
[01:22:28.242 --> 01:22:28.022]  91?
[01:22:28.262 --> 01:22:29.442]  We need to go up to 92.
[01:22:30.143 --> 01:22:37.927]  So you never hear about the record economic numbers, the record jobs growth, everything else, the record low unemployment.
[01:22:38.807 --> 01:22:39.808]  And then Gallup has the poll.
[01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:46.772]  Only 20% of people have a great deal slash quite a lot of confidence in TV news, even less in Congress.
[01:22:47.725 --> 01:22:52.829]  See, folks, and that's why everything they say, oh, you know, the blue wave is inevitable, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:22:53.250 --> 01:22:54.151]  People aren't buying it.
[01:22:54.851 --> 01:22:56.893]  People are not buying it anymore.
[01:22:57.874 --> 01:22:59.835]  And so they know all the negative coverage is fake.
[01:22:59.895 --> 01:23:02.818]  So you notice, though, I mean, the numbers pretty much correlate.
[01:23:03.799 --> 01:23:06.101]  Meanwhile, Gay Frogs is actually a real story.
[01:23:07.342 --> 01:23:11.946]  And now apparently there's like a whole swamp of them in San Francisco.
[01:23:13.706 --> 01:23:16.167]  But they make fun of Alex Jones for reporting on that fact.
[01:23:16.487 --> 01:23:20.107]  Meanwhile, they ignore all the real news that's going on in this country.
[01:23:20.147 --> 01:23:20.667]  But you know what?
[01:23:22.268 --> 01:23:28.429]  One thing I've learned here, covering the most recent Trump rallies, is that Trump rallies don't make television news.
[01:23:28.989 --> 01:23:29.849]  Nobody covers it.
[01:23:30.209 --> 01:23:35.831]  Fox News, Fox Business, MSNBC, CNN, Bloomberg, CNBC.
[01:23:36.031 --> 01:23:36.831]  I monitor it all.
[01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:38.291]  I do it live.
[01:23:39.751 --> 01:23:40.531]  None of them cover them.
[01:23:41.492 --> 01:23:42.852]  Zero coverage of the Trump rally.
[01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:45.924]  So, you know what?
[01:23:46.004 --> 01:23:47.745]  We'll go ahead and play some clips from the Trump rally.
[01:23:48.546 --> 01:23:56.032]  First, let's go to a quick clip of President Trump talking about the Democrat campaign to resist.
[01:23:57.033 --> 01:24:08.342]  The very first minute Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, radical Democrats were on a mission to resist, obstruct, delay, demolish, and destroy.
[01:24:08.382 --> 01:24:09.783]  They wanted to destroy that man.
[01:24:10.724 --> 01:24:12.906]  Of course, they wanted to destroy me too, but that's okay.
[01:24:15.276 --> 01:24:16.437]  Me, we understand.
[01:24:16.457 --> 01:24:17.478]  Him, how can you do that?
[01:24:18.739 --> 01:24:20.220]  They want to destroy everything.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:21.281]  That's all they're good at.
[01:24:21.841 --> 01:24:22.622]  Resisting.
[01:24:23.002 --> 01:24:24.824]  Their whole campaign is resist.
[01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:26.845]  Ours is to create.
[01:24:29.988 --> 01:24:33.350]  That's the kind of stuff that's going to get him re-elected.
[01:24:34.071 --> 01:24:38.334]  And, again, the blue wave, folks, it's so fake news.
[01:24:38.995 --> 01:24:40.016]  It's just so fake news.
[01:24:40.736 --> 01:24:42.678]  What evidence do they have of a blue wave?
[01:24:44.133 --> 01:24:47.154]  Barack Obama spoke in California, what was it, last week I think?
[01:24:47.174 --> 01:24:51.355]  7,500 seat venue, didn't even get 1,000 butts in the seats.
[01:24:52.075 --> 01:24:53.916]  That's Obama, that's the cult leader.
[01:24:54.376 --> 01:24:56.977]  Couldn't even get 1,000 people to turn out in California!
[01:24:57.957 --> 01:25:02.378]  Trump does four rallies a week and gets an aggregate of 100,000 people!
[01:25:04.159 --> 01:25:04.539]  Oh yeah.
[01:25:05.699 --> 01:25:06.220]  Blue wave.
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:07.280]  Mm-hmm.
[01:25:08.717 --> 01:25:12.981]  Now, you've heard Lock her up at just about every Trump rally.
[01:25:13.641 --> 01:25:22.648]  Of course, this is normally aimed at Hillary Clinton, but it took an interesting turn at last night's rally in Iowa when the crowd chanted, Lock her up.
[01:25:23.989 --> 01:25:25.871]  Senator Feinstein, that's another beauty.
[01:25:29.494 --> 01:25:30.295]  That's a beauty!
[01:25:31.736 --> 01:25:33.757]  Did you leak the documents?
[01:25:33.777 --> 01:25:33.998]  What?
[01:25:34.018 --> 01:25:34.198]  What?
[01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:36.440]  No, I didn't!
[01:25:38.951 --> 01:25:39.471]  Did we leak?
[01:25:42.033 --> 01:25:42.534]  Did we leak?
[01:25:44.555 --> 01:25:44.735]  No.
[01:25:45.276 --> 01:25:45.496]  No.
[01:25:46.537 --> 01:25:47.017]  No, we didn't.
[01:25:47.057 --> 01:25:47.798]  Did you ever see?
[01:25:48.398 --> 01:25:48.618]  No.
[01:25:49.479 --> 01:25:49.899]  She goes, no.
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.341]  He just said, no, we didn't leak.
[01:26:02.329 --> 01:26:04.230]  And I think they're talking about Feinstein.
[01:26:04.271 --> 01:26:04.851]  Can you believe that?
[01:26:06.312 --> 01:26:08.594]  Now, was that the worst body language, honestly?
[01:26:09.747 --> 01:26:11.609]  In other words, did she leak it 100%?
[01:26:11.729 --> 01:26:11.949]  No.
[01:26:12.329 --> 01:26:13.090]  No.
[01:26:14.331 --> 01:26:15.252]  I don't want to get sued.
[01:26:15.272 --> 01:26:15.252]  99%.
[01:26:15.812 --> 01:26:17.374]  See, now I can't get sued.
[01:26:18.295 --> 01:26:19.335]  Now I can't get sued.
[01:26:20.216 --> 01:26:30.065]  You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob, and that's what the Democrats have become.
[01:26:31.454 --> 01:26:33.735]  Hammering, hammering, hammering.
[01:26:34.095 --> 01:26:35.135]  All right, let's take a phone call.
[01:26:35.595 --> 01:26:38.916]  Let's jump out to Don calling in from Florida.
[01:26:39.016 --> 01:26:39.676]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:26:39.696 --> 01:26:42.577]  Hi, this is Don here.
[01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:54.780]  I don't know if anybody notices this, but a couple of days ago on Gab, a Kanye West account appeared and at the same time he deleted his account on Twitter.
[01:26:56.584 --> 01:26:59.745]  You know, I know he deleted his Twitter account.
[01:26:59.765 --> 01:27:02.727]  I haven't seen if he's gone on Gab or anything.
[01:27:02.767 --> 01:27:03.407]  Is it official?
[01:27:03.487 --> 01:27:04.708]  Like, do you know that's his account?
[01:27:05.988 --> 01:27:11.371]  I'm not sure, but I know it appeared at the same time that he went off of Twitter.
[01:27:11.531 --> 01:27:14.112]  Well, Andrew Torba was on this week, guys, wasn't he?
[01:27:14.992 --> 01:27:23.256]  Well, he's promoting, it's like four posts on there where he's promoting his new album or something that got cancelled.
[01:27:24.977 --> 01:27:45.769]  Well, I am not sure about this, but I'll tell you what, I can reach out to Andrew Torba in the break and see if he's aware of this, but that's really what Gab would need more than anything is just a rush of traffic because a major user of Twitter just switched over to Gab, like, you know, a President Trump or even a Kanye West.
[01:27:46.489 --> 01:27:48.070]  So that would be good for Gab.
[01:27:50.067 --> 01:27:51.368]  I've never seen the account before.
[01:27:51.408 --> 01:27:55.030]  It looks like it's new and it's got these posts that only date back a couple days.
[01:27:56.872 --> 01:27:58.593]  You know, and here's what I'll say as a larger issue.
[01:28:00.703 --> 01:28:03.084]  Social media is so unhealthy, man.
[01:28:03.245 --> 01:28:05.766]  I mean, it is so unhealthy for your mental health.
[01:28:06.206 --> 01:28:09.628]  And that's why you have all the tech elites and Steve Jobs.
[01:28:09.668 --> 01:28:11.309]  They don't let their kids on social media.
[01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:13.151]  They don't let their kids on their iPads.
[01:28:13.751 --> 01:28:15.812]  They know how bad it is for the human brain.
[01:28:16.693 --> 01:28:21.115]  But the Twitter stuff is even worse, man, because, you know, you read this crap on there.
[01:28:21.175 --> 01:28:23.577]  You see the just the dementia and everything of it.
[01:28:24.884 --> 01:28:27.885]  I mean, and you don't even know what's real and what's fake.
[01:28:28.145 --> 01:28:35.227]  You could be sitting on Twitter for an hour, reading a bunch of fake bots, getting angry, and it's not even real.
[01:28:37.208 --> 01:28:40.729]  I just, I just hope, I kind of just hope the social media trend just kind of goes away.
[01:28:47.287 --> 01:28:49.187]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:29:42.173 --> 01:29:46.776]  President Trump calling for a new investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server.
[01:29:47.056 --> 01:29:56.402]  A new bombshell development reveals Hillary Clinton's leaked emails were likely responsible for the deaths of up to 20 CIA agents working in China.
[01:29:56.522 --> 01:30:01.845]  Over a dozen CIA agents may have been killed as a result of Hillary Clinton's leaked emails.
[01:30:02.225 --> 01:30:07.569]  The FBI is denying that, sort of, but the story is still fluid and confusing.
[01:30:08.209 --> 01:30:11.532]  And for some reason, a lot of people don't seem that interested in finding out what actually happened.
[01:30:11.632 --> 01:30:13.933]  Look, the deep state doesn't want to do a damage assessment.
[01:30:13.953 --> 01:30:21.259]  They don't want to grapple with this because to do so would undermine the fiction that what Hillary did caused no damage and deserved no prosecution.
[01:30:21.359 --> 01:30:31.626]  The former Secretary of State's carelessness allowed a Chinese state-owned company to gain access to her emails, giving them the ability to read her messages in real time.
[01:30:31.886 --> 01:30:40.968]  Even worse, the FBI was reportedly warned about this by the intel communities, Inspector General, but did nothing in response.
[01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:46.329]  It's almost like there were, like, folks at the top of the FBI that just weren't interested in anything that made Hillary look bad.
[01:30:46.429 --> 01:30:58.832]  And the fact that this information was discovered, then turned over to the FBI, and the FBI counterintelligence office, including Mr. Peter Strzok, apparently took no interest in it.
[01:30:59.592 --> 01:31:00.313]  It's shocking.
[01:31:20.325 --> 01:31:22.867]  It is time to hold people accountable.
[01:31:23.307 --> 01:31:33.137]  It is time to perform an actual investigation into Hillary's breach of protocol and her facilitating this cyber attack on our country.
[01:31:33.317 --> 01:31:34.819]  What the heck were the Clintons doing?
[01:31:35.079 --> 01:31:38.142]  Why have there been no substantive prosecutions in this case at all?
[01:31:38.282 --> 01:31:40.304]  The reason I think at this point is pretty obvious.
[01:31:40.444 --> 01:31:49.587]  As a result of this massive intelligence leak, China was able to discover the identities and capture some 20 CIA agents who were then either tortured or murdered.
[01:31:49.787 --> 01:32:04.571]  This was a sophisticated intelligence operation in which they were able to generate what is called a courtesy copy of every incoming and outgoing email that Hillary received in her mansion in upstate New York.
[01:32:04.751 --> 01:32:07.172]  Told actually in the bathroom of her mansion.
[01:32:07.312 --> 01:32:18.902]  You had dozens of CIA and American sources and operatives in China killed and imprisoned by the Chinese government because they got access to those top secret files.
[01:32:18.922 --> 01:32:26.228]  One agent was actually shot and killed right in front of a Chinese government building in an apparent message designed to intimidate Washington.
[01:32:26.348 --> 01:32:32.873]  It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.
[01:32:33.494 --> 01:32:34.435]  Because you'd be in jail.
[01:32:46.167 --> 01:32:48.908]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:56.252 --> 01:32:59.454]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:59.854 --> 01:33:05.197]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:05.437 --> 01:33:09.399]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:09.419 --> 01:33:10.860]  You know what a red wave does?
[01:33:13.095 --> 01:33:30.260]  It gives President Donald Trump the mandate to move against the criminals in the Democrat Party that he's now labeled as criminals and last night inched another step further saying, folks, you don't even want to know the crimes these people have committed.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:30.941]  I know it.
[01:33:31.121 --> 01:33:31.621]  I've seen it.
[01:33:32.201 --> 01:33:33.081]  It's unfathomable.
[01:33:33.621 --> 01:33:34.402]  You can't even know.
[01:33:35.482 --> 01:33:38.003]  What will he say tonight in his rally?
[01:33:38.643 --> 01:33:41.844]  But I want to go to some of these clips just to kind of show you
[01:33:43.099 --> 01:33:46.478]  Again, where we're at in the political climate right now.
[01:33:47.887 --> 01:33:51.288]  And it begins with Hillary Clinton.
[01:33:51.348 --> 01:33:54.449]  Now, this is like a competition.
[01:33:54.809 --> 01:33:57.190]  What is a more stunning audio clip?
[01:33:57.310 --> 01:34:02.131]  Is it the CNN panel saying Kanye West is an illiterate negro?
[01:34:02.832 --> 01:34:08.393]  Or is it Hillary Clinton calling for civil war in the United States, guys?
[01:34:08.814 --> 01:34:12.375]  Listen to Hillary Clinton last night on CNN.
[01:34:14.588 --> 01:34:22.296]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.
[01:34:22.816 --> 01:34:31.124]  That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's when civility can start again.
[01:34:31.565 --> 01:34:38.552]  But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.
[01:34:41.138 --> 01:34:44.503]  No, it's American prosperity.
[01:34:44.823 --> 01:34:45.925]  It's American independence.
[01:34:46.625 --> 01:34:48.468]  It's choosing our own destiny.
[01:34:48.488 --> 01:34:50.170]  It's freedom.
[01:34:51.932 --> 01:34:52.754]  But here's the...
[01:34:54.224 --> 01:34:56.125]  Weird twist about what Hillary said.
[01:34:56.545 --> 01:35:00.567]  She says you cannot be civil with someone that is out to destroy what you believe in.
[01:35:01.067 --> 01:35:05.428]  She's basically calling for conservatives to start attacking liberals.
[01:35:06.089 --> 01:35:07.429]  That's really what she's saying.
[01:35:07.849 --> 01:35:09.990]  It's the left that's trying to destroy America.
[01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:12.751]  It's the Democrats that are trying to destroy America.
[01:35:13.231 --> 01:35:15.752]  It's the Democrats trying to destroy everything we believe in.
[01:35:16.113 --> 01:35:21.795]  God, freedom, independence, borders, safety, truth.
[01:35:23.775 --> 01:35:24.375]  Justice?
[01:35:25.616 --> 01:35:26.256]  Humanity?
[01:35:26.616 --> 01:35:30.277]  That's everything we believe in that they're trying to destroy!
[01:35:30.297 --> 01:35:39.080]  I would love to ask Hillary Clinton supporters, you know Hillary said you can't be civil with someone out to destroy everything you believe in.
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.661]  What is it that you believe in that we're trying to destroy?
[01:35:42.341 --> 01:35:43.121]  What are they going to say?
[01:35:43.141 --> 01:35:45.882]  There's no answer to that!
[01:35:47.863 --> 01:35:49.423]  Who's trying to destroy America?
[01:35:49.883 --> 01:35:50.643]  The Democrats!
[01:35:51.224 --> 01:35:51.684]  The left!
[01:35:52.807 --> 01:35:54.028]  They don't even deny it anymore!
[01:35:55.288 --> 01:35:57.910]  They'll tell you out on the streets at their protests, screw America!
[01:35:58.190 --> 01:35:58.950]  It was never great!
[01:36:00.171 --> 01:36:02.232]  Cuomo, New York, America was never great!
[01:36:02.252 --> 01:36:04.834]  That's all they say now!
[01:36:05.534 --> 01:36:06.314]  Angela Rye!
[01:36:07.655 --> 01:36:09.516]  CNN, America was not great!
[01:36:10.657 --> 01:36:11.677]  It's only been racist!
[01:36:12.558 --> 01:36:12.918]  Really!
[01:36:13.578 --> 01:36:14.299]  Move to Africa!
[01:36:16.934 --> 01:36:20.297]  Oh, but you won't make millions of dollars as a fake news person, will you?
[01:36:20.657 --> 01:36:20.937]  No.
[01:36:21.478 --> 01:36:23.599]  That's only here in racist America, isn't it, Angela?
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:30.325]  So there's Hillary Clinton stunningly saying you cannot be civil with someone that wants to destroy everything you believe in.
[01:36:30.585 --> 01:36:33.387]  She's trying to incite a civil war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:34.768 --> 01:36:37.431]  And why is Hillary all of a sudden going back out in public?
[01:36:37.831 --> 01:36:40.553]  Why is she about to announce a huge tour with Bill Clinton?
[01:36:40.973 --> 01:36:41.314]  Hmm.
[01:36:42.295 --> 01:36:42.535]  Hmm.
[01:36:44.850 --> 01:36:45.090]  Hmm.
[01:36:45.631 --> 01:36:48.573]  Alex Jones has a breaking report coming up on all that.
[01:36:48.633 --> 01:36:49.514]  But let's move on now.
[01:36:50.655 --> 01:36:59.844]  Because of the rhetoric of people like Hillary Clinton calling for violence in this country, Rand Paul is worried that someone's going to be killed.
[01:36:59.884 --> 01:37:09.112]  Of course, the left has already tried to do this to Rand Paul, to Steve Scalise, but here's Rand Paul commenting on the current climate in America politically because of the left.
[01:37:10.612 --> 01:37:12.554]  I feel that there's going to be an assassination.
[01:37:12.574 --> 01:37:26.004]  I really worry that someone is going to be killed and that those who are ratcheting up the conversation, those who are ratcheting up saying get in their face, they have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence.
[01:37:26.264 --> 01:37:40.497]  Well, I can remember when you were attacked by your neighbor, even the local media sort of mocked that in their, you know, the coverage, it was, they know how to tow the line without actually going there, but you could tell by the tone of the headlines.
[01:37:41.258 --> 01:37:45.820]  And had it been a Democrat that had been attacked, it would have been entirely different.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.560]  The tone would have been entirely different.
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:51.481]  And the tone was almost like, oh, poor little Rand got his ribs broke.
[01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:52.342]  You know what I mean?
[01:37:52.722 --> 01:38:00.484]  And people were chasing down the developer of your neighborhood and other neighbors to try to figure out, well, you had this coming, right?
[01:38:01.065 --> 01:38:04.826]  The media was trying to figure out what way in which you had this coming.
[01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:07.290]  This is sort of a double standard.
[01:38:07.690 --> 01:38:12.933]  If it's an accusation with no substantiation, it's utterly to be believed.
[01:38:12.993 --> 01:38:14.854]  In my case, it wasn't an accusation.
[01:38:14.874 --> 01:38:16.335]  I actually was assaulted.
[01:38:16.375 --> 01:38:17.696]  He's now a convicted felon.
[01:38:18.156 --> 01:38:21.157]  There is an instability and a violent nature in this man.
[01:38:21.758 --> 01:38:29.242]  There still is a risk of him committing further violence, and yet the media discounted that completely because they don't like my politics.
[01:38:29.762 --> 01:38:31.885]  So this just shows you that it's about politics.
[01:38:31.965 --> 01:38:35.870]  It really isn't about concern or people wanting to lessen violence.
[01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:44.300]  You know, there's all kinds of violence out there, and if the media doesn't want to condemn it when it happens to a Republican, you can see what a double standard we have.
[01:38:44.821 --> 01:38:45.462]  And here's the thing.
[01:38:45.902 --> 01:38:47.864]  The Democrats are calling for it!
[01:38:48.868 --> 01:38:50.569]  They're telling people, yeah, you're justified!
[01:38:50.649 --> 01:38:51.989]  Go out and kill Republicans!
[01:38:52.429 --> 01:38:53.730]  Go out and assault Trump supporters!
[01:38:53.770 --> 01:38:54.430]  You're justified!
[01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:55.731]  That's the right thing to do!
[01:38:56.111 --> 01:38:59.452]  Ask Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, Maxine Waters, Hillary Clinton, they're all doing it!
[01:38:59.472 --> 01:39:00.732]  And notice how they're all women.
[01:39:02.293 --> 01:39:04.714]  They like to use the women to push their violence, don't they?
[01:39:06.575 --> 01:39:07.135]  That's what they do.
[01:39:07.355 --> 01:39:15.918]  They give themselves privilege, and then they think that because they've anointed themselves holier than thou, that they can just get away with anything.
[01:39:18.311 --> 01:39:20.912]  Like, again, I go to this clip on CNN last night.
[01:39:21.313 --> 01:39:30.598]  Just like Hillary Clinton is trying to incite a civil war, what do you think people like Bakari Sellers and Tara Settmeyer are trying to do when they say things like this on CNN?
[01:39:31.858 --> 01:39:33.860]  Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:41.104]  And we have this now, and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it, and he's going to have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures.
[01:39:42.144 --> 01:39:42.985]  That's CNN, folks.
[01:39:43.965 --> 01:39:44.986]  Just looking at Scott's face.
[01:39:46.921 --> 01:39:52.102]  Listen, black folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay?
[01:39:52.522 --> 01:39:55.743]  They've had it with him, and he's an attention whore like the president.
[01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:59.224]  He's all of a sudden now the model spokesperson.
[01:39:59.284 --> 01:40:02.585]  He's the token Negro of the Trump administration.
[01:40:03.025 --> 01:40:06.665]  This is ridiculous, and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously.
[01:40:06.725 --> 01:40:08.466]  He clearly has issues.
[01:40:08.766 --> 01:40:10.066]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:40:10.386 --> 01:40:11.687]  He's already been hospitalized.
[01:40:11.907 --> 01:40:12.987]  Listen to these people.
[01:40:13.587 --> 01:40:16.408]  Thinking that they are allowed to think for all black people.
[01:40:16.748 --> 01:40:22.170]  Listen to these people on CNN claiming, if you're black you have to think the way I tell you to.
[01:40:23.731 --> 01:40:26.192]  How do you think that's going to make black people that support Trump feel?
[01:40:26.872 --> 01:40:33.215]  Again, here they are inciting violence, riling up their base, saying you're justified in hating these people.
[01:40:33.515 --> 01:40:36.616]  You're justified in committing acts of violence against these people.
[01:40:37.236 --> 01:40:41.258]  And I hope Rand Paul, well I know he's right, but I hope someone follows up because
[01:40:43.373 --> 01:40:46.976]  I mean, folks, we're lucky no one's died yet from leftist violence.
[01:40:47.036 --> 01:40:50.298]  Honestly, Heather Heyer, probably a victim of leftist violence.
[01:40:50.538 --> 01:40:51.960]  I mean, honestly, that's really what happened.
[01:40:52.320 --> 01:40:55.322]  But we'll get... That can be debated.
[01:40:56.203 --> 01:40:59.645]  It'll be a clear-as-day situation, and it's gonna happen.
[01:41:00.326 --> 01:41:03.729]  And will Maxine Waters and Hillary Clinton be held accountable?
[01:41:03.829 --> 01:41:08.632]  Will they be hauled in front of a judge to say, you know, your rhetoric caused this?
[01:41:08.812 --> 01:41:09.233]  I doubt it.
[01:41:09.513 --> 01:41:10.133]  But again,
[01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:13.544]  Let's go to the classic double standard of the Clintons.
[01:41:14.545 --> 01:41:23.956]  Again, last night on CNN, listen to the devil witch Hillary comment on the differences between misconduct alleged against Clinton and alleged against Kavanaugh.
[01:41:25.273 --> 01:41:29.074]  You say that you're going to talk about the difficulties that your husband went through, that you went through.
[01:41:29.194 --> 01:41:38.495]  Obviously, you're going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in 1998, the impeachment, the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband.
[01:41:38.555 --> 01:41:40.716]  Are you prepared to answer those questions?
[01:41:40.776 --> 01:41:41.976]  Is he prepared to answer them?
[01:41:42.276 --> 01:41:49.317]  And how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and Kavanaugh and others today?
[01:41:49.557 --> 01:41:53.918]  Well, there's a very significant difference, and that is
[01:41:54.952 --> 01:42:02.494]  The intense, long-lasting, partisan investigation that was conducted in the 90s.
[01:42:04.215 --> 01:42:13.238]  If, you know, the Republicans, starting with President Trump on down, want a comparison, they should welcome such an investigation themselves.
[01:42:15.783 --> 01:42:16.984]  What is she talking about?
[01:42:17.785 --> 01:42:19.306]  There has been investigations!
[01:42:19.907 --> 01:42:24.832]  The New York Times calls up any woman that's been within two feet of Donald Trump and asks if he raped them!
[01:42:26.913 --> 01:42:27.594]  Oh, but you know what?
[01:42:28.055 --> 01:42:29.816]  Here's the truth that Hillary would never tell you.
[01:42:30.076 --> 01:42:32.659]  You know the difference between Kavanaugh and Clinton?
[01:42:33.099 --> 01:42:34.961]  That means Kavanaugh guilty and Clinton innocent?
[01:42:35.361 --> 01:42:37.123]  Bill Clinton is a Democrat.
[01:42:37.623 --> 01:42:39.145]  Guilty until proven Democrat.
[01:42:42.802 --> 01:42:47.163]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[01:42:56.565 --> 01:43:01.665]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:43:44.109 --> 01:43:51.012]  In fact, I thought about calling the Capitol Switchboard myself and going, hello, my name's Alice, but I'm not going to tell you who I am or where I am.
[01:43:51.393 --> 01:43:54.434]  Brett Kavanaugh gang raped me with 14 elves.
[01:43:54.794 --> 01:43:56.895]  Yes, it was 49 years ago.
[01:43:57.016 --> 01:44:02.258]  And Brett Kavanaugh, he also flayed my skin and pulled my fingernails out with pliers.
[01:44:03.899 --> 01:44:06.241]  He drilled my kneecaps!
[01:44:06.281 --> 01:44:07.562]  Yes ma'am, we're very sorry.
[01:44:07.722 --> 01:44:08.682]  Now this is anonymous!
[01:44:08.702 --> 01:44:13.085]  I'm not gonna tell you where or when, just... Okay, Kavanaugh's evil, quick!
[01:44:13.386 --> 01:44:17.849]  Anonymous accuser says Kavanaugh drilled their kneecaps with a Black & Decker drill!
[01:44:18.069 --> 01:44:18.829]  I can't look at her.
[01:44:18.969 --> 01:44:19.910]  It's like Hillary.
[01:44:19.930 --> 01:44:23.432]  There's the bug-eyed vampire bat look that these people have.
[01:44:23.653 --> 01:44:25.414]  And just knowing how she sits in person.
[01:44:25.694 --> 01:44:26.715]  Maybe I'm biased!
[01:44:42.419 --> 01:44:48.665]  We've got a statement now with regard to PayPal and reports that it has ended its relationship with InfoWars.
[01:44:48.705 --> 01:45:00.537]  PayPal joining the slew of tech companies that have severed ties with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, hitting his InfoWars where it hurts, by no longer allowing the site to use the payment processor.
[01:45:00.697 --> 01:45:06.602]  PayPal is the latest company to sever ties with Jones after YouTube, Apple, Spotify, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest.
[01:45:06.682 --> 01:45:19.714]  Last month, the website called Right Wing Watch posted a report highlighting PayPal's continued business relationship with InfoWars, and the Washington Post also noted how business on the InfoWars stores was booming.
[01:45:19.954 --> 01:45:27.961]  PayPal is the latest big tech company to cut ties with far-right conspiracy website InfoWars, stealing a blow to one of founder Alex Jones's revenue sources.
[01:45:28.261 --> 01:45:39.128]  This is of course coming at a time when many at least reports out there of possible censorship of conservative voices and other people in the media has come to light as well so Contessa certainly a story that we're following very closely.
[01:45:39.269 --> 01:45:45.293]  It actually fuels the Trump base because they do feel like they're being silenced.
[01:45:45.493 --> 01:45:46.894]  And we're also standing up
[01:45:47.974 --> 01:45:50.675]  To social media censorship.
[01:45:50.715 --> 01:45:51.556]  That's the new thing.
[01:45:51.976 --> 01:45:56.117]  Apple, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all booted Jones off their platforms.
[01:45:56.137 --> 01:46:07.662]  PayPal on Thursday night informed InfoWars, which runs an online storefront that sells survival gear and herbal supplements, that it has 10 business days to find a new payment processor.
[01:46:07.722 --> 01:46:11.223]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[01:46:11.283 --> 01:46:11.643]  He's out.
[01:46:11.683 --> 01:46:15.265]  We have literally thousands and thousands of complaints coming in.
[01:46:16.245 --> 01:46:17.346]  And you just can't do that.
[01:46:17.386 --> 01:46:28.175]  Jones hit back on his website saying the InfoWarsStore.com site had no political content, and the move emphasizes how the decision was a broader attack on the InfoWars platform.
[01:46:28.236 --> 01:46:39.005]  A PayPal spokesperson says, quote, we undertook an extensive review of the InfoWars sites and found instances that promoted hate, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, hate speech, and bullying policies.
[01:46:46.175 --> 01:46:50.338]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:01.585 --> 01:47:02.526]  You found it.
[01:47:02.786 --> 01:47:04.347]  The tip of the spear.
[01:47:04.827 --> 01:47:09.690]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:47:09.710 --> 01:47:10.891]  You know,
[01:47:13.662 --> 01:47:17.744]  InfoWars really is the black sheep of the media.
[01:47:19.865 --> 01:47:21.125]  We really are the dark knight.
[01:47:22.786 --> 01:47:42.655]  And it hit me in the break because I'm sitting here thinking about the censorship that we all are enduring but more than anyone Alex Jones who's been banned from existing on any social media platform and this broadcast banned as well
[01:47:45.472 --> 01:47:46.512]  Think about it this way, though.
[01:47:48.213 --> 01:47:54.674]  If it wasn't for Infowars and Alex Jones, Donald Trump would probably not be the President of the United States.
[01:47:57.474 --> 01:48:05.296]  And if you go back in time, ladies and gentlemen, from June... When was it that Trump announced?
[01:48:05.316 --> 01:48:05.556]  Was it 2014 or 2015?
[01:48:05.596 --> 01:48:06.016]  I think it was 2014.
[01:48:06.076 --> 01:48:06.376]  June 2014 to July 2016.
[01:48:14.895 --> 01:48:22.980]  During the Republican race, there were very few and far between news outlets that supported President Trump.
[01:48:24.521 --> 01:48:25.101]  Fox News?
[01:48:26.242 --> 01:48:26.482]  Nope.
[01:48:27.783 --> 01:48:28.003]  Nope.
[01:48:29.564 --> 01:48:32.226]  Most of your favorite talk show hosts out there?
[01:48:33.106 --> 01:48:33.326]  Nope.
[01:48:35.948 --> 01:48:42.712]  Alex Jones stood alone with, I will give credit to Michael Savage, he's the only other one that was on the Trump train from the get-go, and Coulter.
[01:48:43.883 --> 01:48:45.544]  Very few and far between, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:45.724 --> 01:48:47.746]  Very few and far between.
[01:48:47.766 --> 01:48:56.312]  Now, why am I saying this, leading into this segment, talking about us being the Dark Knight?
[01:48:57.793 --> 01:48:58.753]  Well, because, guess what?
[01:48:58.973 --> 01:49:02.015]  All of those news outlets, all of those hosts now, love Trump!
[01:49:02.776 --> 01:49:04.077]  They praise Trump every day.
[01:49:04.137 --> 01:49:05.338]  He's doing an amazing job.
[01:49:05.678 --> 01:49:06.378]  He's so great.
[01:49:06.979 --> 01:49:07.759]  They talk about him.
[01:49:07.799 --> 01:49:08.400]  They have him on.
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:12.723]  So, they have no problem enjoying the fruits
[01:49:14.259 --> 01:49:15.140]  Of our labor.
[01:49:16.921 --> 01:49:17.762]  But then what happens?
[01:49:17.982 --> 01:49:20.604]  We get censored and who stands up for us?
[01:49:22.005 --> 01:49:24.186]  Who makes a big deal out of that?
[01:49:25.227 --> 01:49:25.828]  Fox News?
[01:49:26.408 --> 01:49:27.489]  No, a lot of them were for it.
[01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:30.251]  Your favorite talk show host?
[01:49:31.572 --> 01:49:32.853]  No, not really talking about it.
[01:49:34.054 --> 01:49:35.595]  But boy are they glad Trump's in!
[01:49:37.136 --> 01:49:38.817]  Boy are they thrilled that Trump is in!
[01:49:43.137 --> 01:49:48.561]  You give no credit to the people that got him in, which was this audience.
[01:49:53.964 --> 01:49:54.865]  So just think about that.
[01:49:55.325 --> 01:49:59.408]  That is the level of Black Sheep, Dark Knight, Infowars really is.
[01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:03.571]  We told you Trump would win.
[01:50:03.771 --> 01:50:04.672]  We got behind Trump.
[01:50:04.752 --> 01:50:05.953]  We told you he was the real deal.
[01:50:06.923 --> 01:50:14.265]  Before anyone else would, while they were throwing all the arrows at him, we hit the barbed wire, we took it, we were right, and then what happens?
[01:50:14.805 --> 01:50:22.008]  Everyone else climbs over our rotting corpse on the barbed wire and celebrates the victory and leaves us there to die.
[01:50:25.329 --> 01:50:25.989]  And you know what?
[01:50:26.909 --> 01:50:27.990]  I love it.
[01:50:30.010 --> 01:50:31.411]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[01:50:32.571 --> 01:50:34.512]  Let's go to Mark in Florida.
[01:50:34.612 --> 01:50:35.192]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:50:38.035 --> 01:50:42.117]  Hey Owen, I'd like to talk to you about how the left is trying to get rid of all our news sources.
[01:50:42.137 --> 01:50:44.557]  We've got to really consider that.
[01:50:45.098 --> 01:50:46.698]  People like Tucker Carlson need to be supported.
[01:50:47.499 --> 01:50:50.800]  And Fox News, like you were saying, is sort of a Trojan horse.
[01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.521]  They're pulling up Ben Shapiro real recently.
[01:50:53.701 --> 01:50:54.541]  It's a serious issue.
[01:50:54.761 --> 01:50:57.222]  Yeah, Ben Shapiro will be hosting on Fox News before long.
[01:50:57.642 --> 01:50:58.503]  And look, here's the other thing.
[01:50:59.043 --> 01:51:06.366]  I really don't want to get too much into it because I like a lot of these people, but they know who they can put on air and then they won't cross lines.
[01:51:06.626 --> 01:51:06.966]  They know.
[01:51:09.420 --> 01:51:11.061]  Sure, but I would just be wary, that's all.
[01:51:11.601 --> 01:51:13.922]  I'd like to talk about polarization for a minute if you'd like.
[01:51:14.482 --> 01:51:14.882]  Go ahead.
[01:51:15.322 --> 01:51:27.027]  You've got to be real wary about the delusion of the left, because Scott Adams, who's the cartoonist that draws Gilbert, had a great quote just after Trump won, which was, they've now unloaded all their big guns.
[01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:30.328]  They've called Trump all the worst dictator names you could call him.
[01:51:30.348 --> 01:51:31.388]  They've compared him to Hitler.
[01:51:31.808 --> 01:51:33.409]  They've launched their greatest salvo.
[01:51:34.195 --> 01:51:40.679]  Yes, but I think there's still, I think that there's a bit of delusion there, Mark, because they still don't understand that the media isn't working.
[01:51:40.699 --> 01:51:42.900]  They've been so confident in the media industry working for them,
[01:52:00.731 --> 01:52:03.754]  Not just, I mean, literally putting out their talking points and narratives.
[01:52:03.874 --> 01:52:07.918]  I mean, like, working as far as getting whatever their agenda is accomplished.
[01:52:08.158 --> 01:52:16.445]  So they're still under this delusion that if they still hit Trump, he's a racist, everything on CNN and MSNBC and the New York Times and the Washington Post every day, that they're going to win.
[01:52:16.946 --> 01:52:19.188]  I really think they're still under that delusion, Mark.
[01:52:20.049 --> 01:52:20.829]  Oh, they certainly are.
[01:52:21.806 --> 01:52:27.189]  What's worrying is that if they really believe that he's Hitler, there's a couple million people out there, oh, and that really do believe that.
[01:52:27.289 --> 01:52:27.490]  Sure.
[01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:29.571]  And those extremists are the ones we've got to be worried about.
[01:52:29.711 --> 01:52:30.391]  No, absolutely.
[01:52:30.431 --> 01:52:32.733]  And those are the people that go out and try to kill Republicans.
[01:52:32.753 --> 01:52:33.393]  They already have.
[01:52:33.673 --> 01:52:39.397]  Those are the ones that Hillary Clinton and Maxine Waters and the criminal Democrat Party are trying to incite to violence.
[01:52:39.597 --> 01:52:40.318]  Because here's the thing.
[01:52:41.058 --> 01:52:44.540]  It's just like any classical... I mean, you can go back and look at history.
[01:52:44.901 --> 01:52:50.124]  Whenever there's a leader of a country who's in big trouble,
[01:52:51.394 --> 01:52:56.156]  Who knows if justice befell them, you know, they're going to have their head on a pike.
[01:52:56.796 --> 01:52:57.276]  What do they do?
[01:52:57.336 --> 01:52:58.197]  They start a war!
[01:52:58.857 --> 01:53:00.378]  It's the perfect distraction!
[01:53:00.598 --> 01:53:02.819]  You don't want to get arrested and hung from the highest tree?
[01:53:03.179 --> 01:53:04.339]  Go start a war!
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:06.820]  Go get a bunch of people fighting in the streets!
[01:53:07.541 --> 01:53:08.701]  That's what they're doing!
[01:53:08.981 --> 01:53:11.042]  All these Democrats know their criminal behavior!
[01:53:11.182 --> 01:53:11.742]  They all know!
[01:53:11.802 --> 01:53:12.523]  Trump knows it!
[01:53:13.343 --> 01:53:21.325]  And so they're trying to start a war to distract from their crimes and hope if the war gets out of control enough, they can slink off into the dark of night.
[01:53:21.825 --> 01:53:22.766]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[01:53:22.826 --> 01:53:24.826]  Let's go to Mike in Idaho.
[01:53:24.846 --> 01:53:25.206]  Go ahead.
[01:53:26.747 --> 01:53:28.147]  What's going on, Owen?
[01:53:29.648 --> 01:53:32.028]  Just play-by-play of life in America.
[01:53:33.169 --> 01:53:33.869]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:34.329 --> 01:53:35.909]  Play-by-play all day, man.
[01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:41.191]  These sons of men with the plan that liberals can't seem to understand, you know?
[01:53:41.906 --> 01:53:43.307]  I believe poorly because of it.
[01:53:43.347 --> 01:53:46.548]  I was living down there and it got so bad that I moved over to Idaho here.
[01:53:46.568 --> 01:53:48.389]  We're talking about- It's a little bit freer.
[01:53:48.429 --> 01:53:49.789]  You can walk a little bit taller.
[01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:54.791]  You know, it's just sad what the Democrats have done.
[01:53:54.971 --> 01:53:57.432]  You know, it's really not just the West Coast.
[01:53:57.472 --> 01:53:58.953]  They do it to every inner city.
[01:53:59.233 --> 01:54:05.135]  You know, they do it to every inner city and then somehow they still have these people believing that they care about them and that they're going to fix things.
[01:54:05.435 --> 01:54:09.717]  Here are the Democrats running things for 50 years telling you, we're going to fix things.
[01:54:11.417 --> 01:54:12.697]  Yeah, they didn't fix nothing.
[01:54:12.717 --> 01:54:16.178]  They made it the most unpleasant place to live when it actually used to be decent.
[01:54:16.278 --> 01:54:36.122]  It used to be fairly okay, but it got so bad where I was actually working at Whole Foods, and to make a long story short, I couldn't even operate amongst them because it was so bad with the gender police that I just gave up even trying to be level-headed with them because it was just basically a group of authoritarians.
[01:54:36.881 --> 01:54:39.403]  I just, honestly man, it's sad.
[01:54:39.643 --> 01:54:42.105]  It really is sad, because I think about my hometown of St.
[01:54:42.145 --> 01:54:44.387]  Louis, and I think about what the Democrats have done to that.
[01:54:44.487 --> 01:54:46.829]  I mean, they just destroyed that inner city.
[01:54:47.129 --> 01:54:48.130]  Just destroyed it!
[01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:52.553]  And it could be such a beautiful place, such beautiful architecture, the riverfront, everything.
[01:54:52.933 --> 01:54:55.315]  Just like in every inner city that they destroy.
[01:54:55.696 --> 01:55:00.639]  Just like San Francisco could be, I mean, it's so beautiful, but the Democrats just destroy it!
[01:55:00.699 --> 01:55:02.140]  They just destroy everything!
[01:55:02.941 --> 01:55:03.862]  Thank you for the call, Mike.
[01:55:03.882 --> 01:55:06.004]  Let's go to a caller from California, Lori.
[01:55:06.024 --> 01:55:07.285]  She deals with this.
[01:55:07.325 --> 01:55:08.025]  Go ahead, Lori.
[01:55:08.045 --> 01:55:09.066]  Yes, hi.
[01:55:09.226 --> 01:55:12.189]  I am a sixth-generation Northern Californian.
[01:55:12.849 --> 01:55:22.117]  We do not have the resources to get up and leave like a majority of people I know who are conservatives have, and we wouldn't do that.
[01:55:23.198 --> 01:55:25.160]  We, my husband and I, are both deplorables.
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:29.083]  We totally support Trump, and I've been a listener for 15 years.
[01:55:29.884 --> 01:55:31.045]  We really think that
[01:55:32.051 --> 01:55:35.733]  We need a red tsunami, not a red wave here in California.
[01:55:35.753 --> 01:55:37.875]  Well, Lori, I was actually shocked by this.
[01:55:38.255 --> 01:55:43.498]  The last I checked, I believe it's the governor race in the state of California.
[01:55:43.518 --> 01:55:44.079]  Guys, look this up.
[01:55:44.479 --> 01:55:48.662]  I believe the governor race is only a six point margin right now for a Democrat.
[01:55:48.702 --> 01:55:49.522]  Only six points.
[01:55:50.063 --> 01:55:50.323]  Yeah.
[01:55:51.502 --> 01:55:51.682]  Yeah.
[01:55:52.303 --> 01:55:53.504]  We've got to vote for Cox.
[01:55:53.945 --> 01:55:59.230]  And then Feinstein is running against, for our senator, Feinstein against Leon.
[01:55:59.751 --> 01:56:03.215]  So we have to vote for Feinstein because she's the lesser of two evils.
[01:56:03.535 --> 01:56:08.000]  And as horrible as this sounds, you know, if she dies off, then we get somebody better.
[01:56:10.225 --> 01:56:12.246]  It's just such a mess here.
[01:56:12.426 --> 01:56:13.967]  But what do people say, Lori?
[01:56:14.848 --> 01:56:24.974]  What do people say in California that vote Democrat when you've had Pelosi, Waters, and Feinstein running the state this entire, for like three decades, running it right into the ground?
[01:56:24.994 --> 01:56:26.114]  I mean, how do they reason that?
[01:56:26.394 --> 01:56:29.216]  What do they say to justify voting for these women?
[01:56:30.076 --> 01:56:31.537]  You know, I honestly don't know.
[01:56:31.557 --> 01:56:33.238]  I honestly don't know.
[01:56:33.398 --> 01:56:36.080]  Because if you try to discuss it,
[01:56:37.006 --> 01:56:48.369]  Rationally, and you know, I like to talk to people, find out why they feel, how they feel, and what their thinking process is in a peaceful and adult conversation, they go off on rants.
[01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:53.910]  And too many times I've tried talking like that and I've had to leave because, you know, I was afraid of violence.
[01:56:54.791 --> 01:56:59.832]  And it's really sad because it's just, what you're doing is you're opening up the cult mindset.
[01:56:59.852 --> 01:57:00.112]  Exactly.
[01:57:00.732 --> 01:57:01.772]  And once you tap that nerve,
[01:57:05.171 --> 01:57:10.454]  Once you hit that nerve that, you know, lets them know, hey, you're in a cult and you know it.
[01:57:10.974 --> 01:57:12.835]  Once you hit that nerve, that's when they panic.
[01:57:13.396 --> 01:57:20.860]  You know, that's when they go into the panics and they start shrieking and yelling and cursing and calling you names because you just hit the nerve of reality.
[01:57:21.721 --> 01:57:29.765]  You just hit the nerve and they'd rather not face the facts that they're a member of a cult, a groupthink cult, and they're totally ignorant.
[01:57:29.965 --> 01:57:31.126]  They can't face the facts.
[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:37.822]  Takes a lot of money to fight a war.
[01:57:37.842 --> 01:57:39.644]  Takes a lot of money to take on Soros.
[01:57:40.825 --> 01:57:42.667]  And I want to win this thing.
[01:57:42.727 --> 01:57:44.669]  And I think Infant War should stay in the fight.
[01:57:44.689 --> 01:57:56.181]  If people don't go buy a bunch of t-shirts and water filters and air filtration and things you already need, non GMO heirloom seeds and high quality organic Wake Up America coffee grown in southern Mexico in the high mountains and get the supplements, we will be destroyed.
[01:57:56.282 --> 01:57:58.524]  If you fund us with the millions of dollars we have, we're unstoppable.
[01:57:58.884 --> 01:58:02.946]  So, we've got Happies, the new mood and stress natural herbal formula.
[01:58:03.006 --> 01:58:05.168]  Super concentrated, 50% off out of the gates.
[01:58:05.248 --> 01:58:07.009]  So you can try it and see how great it works.
[01:58:07.209 --> 01:58:08.189]  Works a little too good on me.
[01:58:08.209 --> 01:58:10.050]  My wife's like, what the hell are you on?
[01:58:10.250 --> 01:58:12.151]  It's totally natural, but it just smooths you out.
[01:58:12.171 --> 01:58:13.512]  It's not a depressant, not a stimulant.
[01:58:13.552 --> 01:58:14.212]  It's the opposite.
[01:58:14.233 --> 01:58:15.333]  It's just relaxing.
[01:58:15.473 --> 01:58:18.295]  Obviously, the FDA is in competition with Mother Nature.
[01:58:18.495 --> 01:58:22.577]  And so, you just need to read the ingredients on here and do your own research for yourself.
[01:58:22.697 --> 01:58:24.438]  And I'm just going to tell you, they're very, very strong.
[01:58:24.458 --> 01:58:25.359]  They're very, very organic.
[01:58:25.419 --> 01:58:26.859]  They're very, very concentrated.
[01:58:26.959 --> 01:58:27.920]  Happies contains
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:29.061]  Ashwagandha root.
[01:58:29.181 --> 01:58:31.223]  And again, the rhodiola root is really the key.
[01:58:31.243 --> 01:58:32.324]  You need to look into that the most.
[01:58:32.424 --> 01:58:38.850]  Passion, flower, herb, green, tea, leaf, licorice root, and many other key ingredients that you need to research for yourself.
[01:58:39.050 --> 01:58:42.693]  All these ingredients combined to create an incredible formula to help fuel the mind and body.
[01:58:42.733 --> 01:58:43.434]  Amazing.
[01:58:43.494 --> 01:58:46.217]  Happy's Mood and Stress, our newest product.
[01:58:46.537 --> 01:58:46.217]  $22.47.

[01:59:03.121 --> 01:59:05.302]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[01:59:05.362 --> 01:59:07.963]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[01:59:08.363 --> 01:59:13.686]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[01:59:13.926 --> 01:59:22.030]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:27.312]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[01:59:27.852 --> 01:59:29.593]  Right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:29.633 --> 01:59:31.154]  Please support this network.
[01:59:34.392 --> 01:59:40.377]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:41.858 --> 01:59:57.471]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, one of the favorite attacks against Infowars that the hearsay mafia engages in, the parrots of the New World Order engage in, is... Gay frogs!
[01:59:57.511 --> 01:59:58.151]  Gay frogs!
[01:59:58.191 --> 01:59:58.832]  Gay frogs!
[01:59:59.534 --> 02:00:01.116]  They ignore the scientific studies.
[02:00:02.718 --> 02:00:05.922]  They ignore the videos and the reports of the studies they've done.
[02:00:06.262 --> 02:00:06.743]  But yes!
[02:00:07.283 --> 02:00:10.087]  Chemicals are turning the frogs gay.
[02:00:11.676 --> 02:00:18.402]  People always use that quote to make fun of Alex Jones, but really, it's actually happening, okay?
[02:00:18.442 --> 02:00:29.673]  In fact, it's not only turning frogs gay, it's completely changing their sex organs and turning male frogs into female frogs that can successfully reproduce.
[02:00:30.494 --> 02:00:33.617]  Atrazine is one of the most widely used pesticides
[02:00:34.162 --> 02:00:37.143]  Used on corn crops, rice, and wheat crops.
[02:00:37.423 --> 02:00:46.005]  It's used by the massive companies that grow the food that goes into your cereal, your popcorn, your bread, and so many other different foods that you eat.
[02:00:46.305 --> 02:00:52.066]  When exposed to small amounts of atrazine, some of the amphibian males grow up and literally become female.
[02:00:52.826 --> 02:01:01.328]  So these are two males that not only are mating, but have the ability to lay eggs even though they're genetically chromosomal males.
[02:01:02.288 --> 02:01:12.034]  Atrazine wreaks havoc with the sex lives of adult male frogs, emasculating three quarters of them and turning one in ten into females, according to a study by Berkeley.
[02:01:12.314 --> 02:01:16.637]  Atrazine is banned in the EU, but is still used copiously in the US.
[02:01:17.177 --> 02:01:20.800]  It's used on everything from cornfields to Christmas tree farms.
[02:01:21.300 --> 02:01:21.380]  Okay.
[02:01:40.485 --> 02:01:45.067]  Disrupts testicular structure and alters testosterone levels in male animals.
[02:01:45.548 --> 02:01:55.872]  Exposure to only one dose of Atrazine disrupted neonatal male gonadal histofunctional features, which means it changed the ability of the testicle to function.
[02:01:56.153 --> 02:02:02.236]  Alterations described can have detrimental effect on the sexual maturation of any male animals.
[02:02:02.556 --> 02:02:07.098]  The chemical is effectively eliminating male chromosomes at an alarming rate,
[02:02:07.638 --> 02:02:12.903]  At levels which are three times lower than what are currently appearing in our drinking water.
[02:02:13.527 --> 02:02:25.438]  Atrazine affects men adversely by literally shrinking their gonads or causing them to effectively become women, but it also affects women, causing low estrogen levels and irregular menstruation.
[02:02:25.698 --> 02:02:31.163]  The effects of atrazine on male development are consistent across all vertebrate classes examined.
[02:02:31.563 --> 02:02:39.130]  That means not only in the animals they tested, but even humans, dogs, horses, virtually all animals.
[02:02:39.770 --> 02:02:51.155]  People are quick to shout conspiracy theorists when anyone talks about anything that sounds crazy, but you know, reality is actually stranger than fiction and it does seem insane.
[02:02:51.175 --> 02:02:53.796]  I mean, chemicals in the water turning the frogs gay?
[02:02:54.797 --> 02:03:01.560]  People always use that quote to make fun of Alex Jones when this has actually been scientifically proven.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.863]  Recently there's been a lot of talk about soy boys and how soy is emasculating men.
[02:03:08.643 --> 02:03:09.243]  I don't think.
[02:03:09.924 --> 02:03:11.904]  It's soy you have to worry about.
[02:03:11.944 --> 02:03:14.605]  Xenoestrogens are everywhere.
[02:03:15.206 --> 02:03:16.266]  Research BPA.
[02:03:16.606 --> 02:03:25.029]  BPA is a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic which is what many bottles and even baby bottles are made out of.
[02:03:25.610 --> 02:03:34.433]  BPA is such a potent xenoestrogen that it was actually once considered for use as a synthetic estrogen in hormone replacement therapy.
[02:03:35.123 --> 02:03:43.227]  And there have been many studies that show that BPA leaches off of baby bottles into the milk and therefore into the babies.
[02:03:43.687 --> 02:03:48.409]  So we are essentially dosing infants with a synthetic estrogen.
[02:03:48.889 --> 02:03:57.534]  So I recommend investing in a water filter and start using glass, stainless steel or ceramic bottles.
[02:03:58.154 --> 02:04:02.316]  And remember, there is no liberty when there is forced medicine.
[02:04:02.916 --> 02:04:14.363]  These pesticides land up in our food and water, but our water is fluoridated deliberately when there is absolutely no reason to do so.
[02:04:14.623 --> 02:04:17.445]  But that's a topic for a whole other video.
[02:04:17.505 --> 02:04:18.405]  Thanks for listening.
[02:04:18.465 --> 02:04:22.368]  If you're concerned with how these chemicals are affecting humans and the environment,
[02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:24.490]  Make sure to spread the word.
[02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:28.255]  And of course, we've got air filters, water filters at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:04:28.275 --> 02:04:29.036]  But isn't it funny?
[02:04:29.877 --> 02:04:36.826]  As soon as we raise an awareness about an anthropogenic environment impact, they just discount it.
[02:04:37.507 --> 02:04:39.430]  So it only counts if they bring it up, not if we do.
[02:04:43.855 --> 02:05:00.082]  Imagine 20 years ago, if I would have told you that in 2018, a Nazi collaborator, George Soros, would be in control of our media, our government, and that anybody that criticized him would be banned from the internet, and even banned from commerce, and being able to process credit cards.
[02:05:00.863 --> 02:05:09.346]  Well, Soros bought control of PayPal last month, and even though we've been working with PayPal for 20 years, they banned us, with the magic word, hate speech.
[02:05:10.107 --> 02:05:12.748]  Now, if that was a Nazi collaborator, like Soros, it'd be okay.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:15.281]  That's how crazy all this is.
[02:05:15.701 --> 02:05:20.283]  So they're betting that you're just going to put up with the abuse like conservatives always do and just go away.
[02:05:20.983 --> 02:05:24.604]  But the biggest thing you can do is call Congress, call the White House, call talk radio.
[02:05:24.764 --> 02:05:27.365]  Make a big deal out of this because other conservatives are next.
[02:05:27.385 --> 02:05:28.026]  It's already happening.
[02:05:28.246 --> 02:05:35.529]  And with our regular credit card processes we have at InfoWarsTore.com, get in there and get some of the amazing products we've got so you can't lose.
[02:05:35.549 --> 02:05:39.570]  You get great products while you're funding the information war at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:43.372]  You can let that old Nazi collaborator Soros tell you to shove it up as you know what.
[02:05:52.308 --> 02:05:58.750]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:59.211 --> 02:06:02.592]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:04.052 --> 02:06:12.635]  You know, I'd like to start a campaign to return James Brown's wig to its rightful owner.
[02:06:13.996 --> 02:06:16.217]  You know, Maxine Waters, she's stolen enough in this country.
[02:06:16.597 --> 02:06:19.358]  For her to steal James Brown's wig and get away with it, you know, I just...
[02:06:20.811 --> 02:06:22.811]  I want justice for James Brown's wig.
[02:06:23.912 --> 02:06:26.592]  Maxine Waters is a criminal that stole James Brown's wig.
[02:06:28.792 --> 02:06:41.895]  And you just can't, you just cannot let, you cannot let the, the father of funk have his wig stolen by a kleptocrat like Maxine Waters.
[02:06:42.115 --> 02:06:42.975]  Cause he's got soul.
[02:06:44.695 --> 02:06:46.215]  Maxine Waters has no soul.
[02:06:46.675 --> 02:06:47.496]  She eats souls.
[02:06:49.676 --> 02:06:50.056]  Anyway.
[02:06:51.380 --> 02:06:52.860]  You heard the report, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:54.501 --> 02:06:56.841]  Yeah, gay frogs is a real thing.
[02:06:57.801 --> 02:06:58.982]  It's caused by atrazine.
[02:06:59.722 --> 02:07:08.064]  There have been multiple scientific studies done, but it doesn't matter because every time I go out in public and they see my InfoWars mic flag, they say, gay frogs.
[02:07:08.864 --> 02:07:10.564]  And that somehow gives them an intellectual victory.
[02:07:10.804 --> 02:07:12.345]  These are the brainwashed masses.
[02:07:12.785 --> 02:07:14.145]  But, you know, it's just like what I was saying.
[02:07:14.245 --> 02:07:17.366]  Isn't it funny, if the left comes out
[02:07:18.223 --> 02:07:37.587]  With any anthropogenic claim, whether it's, you know, climate change or pollution, whatever it is, coal, if humans are causing any impact to the environment, the left causes hell and says, this is going to kill all of us and it must be stopped.
[02:07:37.627 --> 02:07:38.207]  I can't believe you.
[02:07:38.247 --> 02:07:39.147]  You don't care about life?
[02:07:40.847 --> 02:07:43.088]  You won't pay a billion dollars to stop climate change?
[02:07:43.148 --> 02:07:43.668]  Oh my gosh.
[02:07:45.742 --> 02:07:46.802]  It's man-made climate change.
[02:07:46.822 --> 02:07:47.703]  It's man-made global warming.
[02:07:47.863 --> 02:07:48.563]  Why won't you stop it?
[02:07:49.464 --> 02:07:53.005]  So that's their issue, which they have no science to base it off of.
[02:07:53.565 --> 02:07:59.328]  And then we actually bring an issue of real anthropogenic environment impact.
[02:07:59.888 --> 02:08:08.692]  The atrazine that we use to spray on plants and crops, agriculture, goes into the food and water.
[02:08:09.690 --> 02:08:11.932]  And then changes our very biology.
[02:08:12.312 --> 02:08:14.214]  Changes the biology of animals on Earth.
[02:08:14.594 --> 02:08:22.400]  So we raise that issue, which is a scientific, factually proven, man-made environmental impact, and then what does the left do?
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.121]  They just discount it.
[02:08:24.222 --> 02:08:25.082]  No, it doesn't exist!
[02:08:27.744 --> 02:08:28.685]  Alex Jones reported it.
[02:08:28.825 --> 02:08:29.246]  It's fake.
[02:08:30.507 --> 02:08:31.027]  No, no, no, look.
[02:08:31.367 --> 02:08:32.188]  Here's the science.
[02:08:32.488 --> 02:08:33.249]  Here's the videos.
[02:08:33.489 --> 02:08:34.330]  Here's the research.
[02:08:34.530 --> 02:08:35.090]  It's all there.
[02:08:35.150 --> 02:08:36.952]  Here are the frogs humping each other, laying eggs.
[02:08:38.735 --> 02:08:40.556]  Oh, but InfoWars said it, so it's not true!
[02:08:40.576 --> 02:08:41.536]  No, no, no, no, no!
[02:08:43.077 --> 02:08:44.717]  Man-made global warming is true, though.
[02:08:44.937 --> 02:08:45.958]  We have no science.
[02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:47.218]  We have no facts.
[02:08:48.118 --> 02:08:55.321]  We don't even take into account the sun, or volcanoes, or the ice core samples.
[02:08:55.681 --> 02:09:00.062]  We don't know anything except man-made global warming has to be real because we say so!
[02:09:02.103 --> 02:09:04.204]  But then we report on gay frogs, which is real.
[02:09:04.224 --> 02:09:07.205]  We have the science, we have the research, we have everything, and they say, no!
[02:09:09.755 --> 02:09:12.516]  I mean, I just can't even believe this world I live in.
[02:09:12.557 --> 02:09:13.117]  How is this real?
[02:09:16.299 --> 02:09:23.062]  Anyway, folks, we know about the chemicals in the food and water, so that's why we sell water filters.
[02:09:23.702 --> 02:09:25.223]  Wow, imagine that.

[02:11:08.569 --> 02:11:09.870]  That's just the truth.
[02:11:10.973 --> 02:11:13.694]  And Alex is going to be back live tonight, 8 to 10 p.m.
[02:11:13.734 --> 02:11:14.094]  Central.
[02:11:14.134 --> 02:11:19.237]  We're launching extended live broadcasts from 8 to 10 p.m.
[02:11:19.437 --> 02:11:21.377]  Central starting tonight.
[02:11:21.838 --> 02:11:24.299]  This is part of our midterm election coverage.
[02:11:24.559 --> 02:11:29.561]  We plan on being live 8 to 10 weeknights up through November 6th.
[02:11:29.721 --> 02:11:31.742]  That, of course, is election night.
[02:11:32.833 --> 02:11:35.716]  And we're gonna see, do you share the broadcast?
[02:11:35.736 --> 02:11:36.457]  Do you tune in?
[02:11:36.477 --> 02:11:37.698]  Do you tell friends and family?
[02:11:37.838 --> 02:11:38.679]  Is our traffic up?
[02:11:38.759 --> 02:11:39.380]  Is it worth it?
[02:11:39.460 --> 02:11:41.142]  Are you funding us at Infowarsstore.com?
[02:11:41.482 --> 02:11:42.343]  Do we have the fuel?
[02:11:42.383 --> 02:11:43.324]  Do we have the capacity?
[02:11:43.384 --> 02:11:44.746]  Are we ready to go next level?
[02:11:46.267 --> 02:11:47.989]  Is the audience ready to take us next level?
[02:11:48.009 --> 02:11:50.172]  So, that's where we're at right now.
[02:11:51.664 --> 02:11:55.428]  But remember, InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:11:55.608 --> 02:11:57.370]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:11:57.510 --> 02:11:58.951]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:11:59.232 --> 02:12:06.939]  I'm actually stunned how many people I meet out on the streets that tell me like, oh man, how are you guys, what are you guys doing now that you're banned?
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:08.221]  Like, what do you mean?
[02:12:08.241 --> 02:12:10.183]  They really think that we're shut down.
[02:12:11.209 --> 02:12:12.631]  They really think we don't exist anymore.
[02:12:12.651 --> 02:12:14.332]  They really think we stopped broadcasting.
[02:12:14.773 --> 02:12:16.875]  They don't know about InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:12:16.955 --> 02:12:18.857]  It blows my mind how many people don't know.
[02:12:19.097 --> 02:12:20.278]  Honestly, it's stunning to me.
[02:12:20.759 --> 02:12:21.940]  Huge InfoWars fans.
[02:12:22.541 --> 02:12:23.482]  Wear our t-shirts.
[02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:25.023]  Tell me how great the supplements are.
[02:12:25.404 --> 02:12:27.025]  And they're like, what are you guys doing now?
[02:12:27.045 --> 02:12:29.408]  I'm like, well, InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:12:29.428 --> 02:12:30.329]  We always have our live streams.
[02:12:30.669 --> 02:12:31.850]  Oh, oh, wow, really?
[02:12:32.691 --> 02:12:33.492]  It's stunning to me.
[02:12:33.532 --> 02:12:39.079]  So it's like I need to come on air and just say Infowars.com slash show at the beginning and end of every segment just to make sure everyone knows.
[02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:41.382]  Because they want to find our intel.
[02:12:41.442 --> 02:12:46.088]  They still have the hunger for the truth just like they always did that made Alex Jones Show powerful.
[02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:49.151]  But it's amazing.
[02:12:49.211 --> 02:12:52.973]  So it's like we don't even do the right, we don't even market ourselves.
[02:12:53.874 --> 02:12:55.295]  We're so obsessed with the information.
[02:12:55.355 --> 02:12:57.837]  So, InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:12:58.237 --> 02:12:59.638]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:12:59.998 --> 02:13:01.339]  InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:13:01.359 --> 02:13:03.000]  We're live 10 hours a day.
[02:13:03.861 --> 02:13:07.443]  We're live 10 hours a day from 8 a.m.
[02:13:07.483 --> 02:13:08.184]  to 6 p.m.
[02:13:08.384 --> 02:13:09.004]  every weekday.
[02:13:10.605 --> 02:13:12.727]  And if we get the funding, and we get the support,
[02:13:14.295 --> 02:13:17.677]  Through the election, with our extended coverage, 8 to 10 p.m.
[02:13:17.717 --> 02:13:20.479]  weeknights, we're going to launch new shows.
[02:13:21.740 --> 02:13:23.441]  So that's where we're at.
[02:13:23.702 --> 02:13:28.265]  50% off the entire InfoWars live product line at InfoWarsStore.com, plus free shipping.
[02:13:28.565 --> 02:13:28.805]  Okay.
[02:13:29.986 --> 02:13:30.766]  Guys, let's roll clip 11.
[02:13:33.519 --> 02:13:39.922]  You've got these fake paid-for protesters that Trump hit again last night in his rally in Iowa.
[02:13:39.962 --> 02:13:41.763]  He'll be live in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight.
[02:13:41.783 --> 02:13:44.884]  He's talking about the paid protesters and now more Republicans are saying it.
[02:13:45.164 --> 02:13:46.805]  Oh and again, who reported that first?
[02:13:47.345 --> 02:13:48.565]  By the way, it's just like what I said.
[02:13:48.826 --> 02:13:51.127]  Who told you Trump was the real deal first?
[02:13:51.287 --> 02:13:51.847]  InfoWars.
[02:13:52.547 --> 02:13:55.969]  Who told you the protesters were paid for by Soros before anyone else would?
[02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:56.809]  InfoWars.
[02:13:57.749 --> 02:13:58.770]  Now who's being censored?
[02:14:00.632 --> 02:14:02.453]  More than anyone else by the tech left.
[02:14:02.573 --> 02:14:03.113]  InfoWars.
[02:14:03.493 --> 02:14:04.934]  Is anyone defending InfoWars?
[02:14:05.914 --> 02:14:09.616]  You really love to report on the Soros paid protesters now?
[02:14:09.916 --> 02:14:13.598]  You really love to tell everyone how great Donald Trump is now?
[02:14:13.918 --> 02:14:15.479]  Why don't you give us a little love?
[02:14:16.283 --> 02:14:16.943]  No, that's fine.
[02:14:16.984 --> 02:14:17.944]  We'll be the Dark Knight.
[02:14:18.344 --> 02:14:19.305]  Here's the clip, though.
[02:14:19.625 --> 02:14:32.234]  Listen to this undercover audio of these paid-for Marxist protesters, which I believe is, they're violating election law here, campaign law, but listen to what they say on this bus.
[02:14:33.328 --> 02:14:38.010]  The likelihood is that we will be out all day and then be coming back later on.
[02:14:38.531 --> 02:14:47.175]  One thing that I wanted to say that is important, if you post on social media, please do not mention that you are from New York City.
[02:14:48.176 --> 02:14:53.879]  The reason is, much so they love us, the FASO campaign on September 15th
[02:14:55.561 --> 02:15:04.963]  She posted that the Delgado campaign was busing in busloads of New York City Democratic Socialists.
[02:15:04.983 --> 02:15:05.504]  Which is true!
[02:15:06.536 --> 02:15:07.597]  Which is what they're doing!
[02:15:07.957 --> 02:15:10.459]  So there's the leader of the paid protest traveling around
[02:15:31.377 --> 02:15:32.779]  And she's like, look, we got caught.
[02:15:32.799 --> 02:15:34.141]  We're not supposed to be doing this.
[02:15:34.501 --> 02:15:37.805]  The people we're campaigning for said they don't want us doing this because it could be illegal.
[02:15:38.066 --> 02:15:38.967]  So just don't tell anyone.
[02:15:38.987 --> 02:15:40.989]  We're still going to do it, but just, you know, just don't tell anyone.
[02:15:50.077 --> 02:15:53.520]  carry staph aureus bacteria in their nose.
[02:15:54.241 --> 02:16:00.145]  Two out of every hundred actually carry MRSA, which is a methicillin-resistant staph.
[02:16:00.666 --> 02:16:06.451]  Now what you're talking about is the bacteria that actually kills more people than aids.
[02:16:06.891 --> 02:16:15.238]  And so what we do is we work really hard, did mass amounts of research, and we found that our gel, your gel,
[02:16:16.278 --> 02:16:18.562]  As a first line of defense, it's amazing.
[02:16:18.642 --> 02:16:26.995]  If you put that on a wound, it will actually put an invisible cover on that wound that will last up to three days.
[02:16:27.748 --> 02:16:34.290]  And it will kill MRSA and regular staph, E. coli, Candida, Aspergillus niger, in minutes.
[02:16:35.090 --> 02:16:51.716]  So the big deal here is that you can have a kid that gets a scratch on a soccer field and ends up dead or ends up losing a leg because they got a MRSA, a methicillin-resistant staph bacteria, from that soccer field.
[02:16:52.436 --> 02:17:00.583]  It's happening in schools, in workout gyms, in the office, on handrails, on telephones, in subways.
[02:17:01.304 --> 02:17:11.532]  And this gel that you have access to is the first line of defense for everybody to be able to just gel up and not have to worry about that bacteria.
[02:17:11.852 --> 02:17:19.659]  You gel it up and you don't worry about it because we have heal rates of about half the normal time and you actually have something now
[02:17:20.492 --> 02:17:23.894]  In your house, where you can easily take care of it.
[02:17:23.914 --> 02:17:37.203]  I think the key is it's super strong and it lasts a long time, because explain why the super silver wound gel dressing from Infowarslife.com that we probably labeled from your top of the line, your top selling product nationwide, why is it so special?
[02:17:37.684 --> 02:17:46.410]  These studies show that our particle goes into your body, washes down 24 hours with no negative effect on any system in your body.
[02:17:46.850 --> 02:17:49.572]  And many of the others do, many of the others do bioaccumulate.
[02:17:50.362 --> 02:17:51.103]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:17:51.223 --> 02:17:59.992]  Over-the-counter, which is what you have available to your people, is so strong that it has direct claims on killing MRSA.
[02:18:00.252 --> 02:18:03.015]  You have one of the only products in the U.S.
[02:18:03.075 --> 02:18:07.079]  that can, like, make a direct claim on mitigation of a sunburn.
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:13.386]  You can put it on a bug bite and it'll stop the itch in about, probably, three or four minutes.
[02:18:14.046 --> 02:18:16.869]  You can put it on any type of burn.
[02:18:16.989 --> 02:18:20.913]  What a blessing to have something that you have in your house right now.
[02:18:21.113 --> 02:18:23.395]  You don't have to go to the doctor to get this.
[02:18:23.595 --> 02:18:36.147]  So hospitals last year had 94,000 life-threatening infections that were caused in the hospitals and they had no antibiotics that would work against them.
[02:18:36.867 --> 02:18:42.311]  That's why they're going back to the silver products because our silver is proven to kill, though.
[02:18:42.872 --> 02:18:49.236]  I mean, the two most heinous bugs are Methicillin-resistant Staph and one called VRE.
[02:18:49.376 --> 02:18:53.959]  And VRE is Ventomycin-resistant Enterococcus Fecalis.
[02:18:54.180 --> 02:18:56.581]  Nobody wants to say it, but it will kill you.
[02:18:57.162 --> 02:19:00.064]  And so the cool part is, this gel kills it in minutes.
[02:19:00.784 --> 02:19:10.235]  So you don't have to worry about your kid getting an amputation or a wound or you don't have to have, you know, a funeral for somebody you lost.
[02:19:10.255 --> 02:19:15.380]  And the bottom line is you guys did years and years and years and years and years and years and years of dozens of peer-reviewed studies.
[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:22.248]  You finally found out the perfect silver, the most effective, and it's available at Infowarsstore.com and you helped save the country.
[02:19:22.688 --> 02:19:24.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:01.149 --> 02:20:05.693]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[02:20:05.973 --> 02:20:08.976]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:09.456 --> 02:20:12.339]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:20:13.835 --> 02:20:20.936]  You know, I love the deception of the Democrats where Hillary Clinton is calling for civil war, Maxine Waters is calling for violence.
[02:20:21.136 --> 02:20:28.298]  I mean, you know, the left-wing media is making claims up to incite violence and justify it.
[02:20:28.958 --> 02:20:37.799]  And then you see a slew of headlines in the last 48 hours saying, Republicans are fear-mongering before the midterms.
[02:20:38.119 --> 02:20:41.480]  Republicans are trying to make their voter base afraid before the midterms.
[02:20:42.762 --> 02:20:44.542]  Literally, folks, dozens of headlines.
[02:20:44.562 --> 02:20:45.583]  I was just telling this to the crew.
[02:20:45.863 --> 02:20:48.904]  I just remember seeing this when I was doing my news research last night.
[02:20:49.544 --> 02:20:50.604]  Dozens of these headlines.
[02:20:51.064 --> 02:20:57.566]  In fact, guys, can you just pull up the search engine results so that we can see all the different outlets that were running with that headline?
[02:20:57.946 --> 02:21:02.907]  And that's how you know it's a propaganda campaign, right out of the Democrat Party.
[02:21:03.891 --> 02:21:10.195]  And it usually originates, the headline at least, in the Washington Post or in the New York Times.
[02:21:10.596 --> 02:21:11.396]  But yeah, there it is.
[02:21:11.576 --> 02:21:14.298]  I mean, how many stories would you say there are there, guys?
[02:21:15.919 --> 02:21:19.302]  Like, at least 10, I would say, at the top, and that's just a basic Google search.
[02:21:21.403 --> 02:21:22.624]  There were at least 10 that I saw.
[02:21:24.684 --> 02:21:25.685]  There's the Washington Post.
[02:21:26.105 --> 02:21:26.726]  An angry mob.
[02:21:26.766 --> 02:21:30.630]  Republicans work to recast Democrat protests as out-of-control anarchy.
[02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:32.472]  So I love the deception of the left.
[02:21:32.552 --> 02:21:34.334]  I mean, seriously.
[02:21:36.236 --> 02:21:37.797]  Do you realize the insanity of this?
[02:21:38.918 --> 02:21:40.400]  The crew is just going through all these headlines.
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:44.624]  But seriously, do you realize the next level insanity of this right now?
[02:21:44.884 --> 02:21:46.506]  This deception?
[02:21:48.430 --> 02:22:09.349]  So the Democrats are literally calling for violence, calling for civil war, justifying it, doing it, actually engaging in all of this, promoting it, and then, out of the other side of their mouth, they say, Republicans are fear-mongering, saying that leftists are getting violent.
[02:22:09.689 --> 02:22:10.270]  What is wrong?
[02:22:10.450 --> 02:22:12.032]  So, I mean, like, what?
[02:22:13.444 --> 02:22:21.285]  So here they are, engaging in violence, trying to start a civil war, and then pointing at Republicans saying, why are you saying we're getting violent?
[02:22:21.946 --> 02:22:23.926]  Why are you telling your voters we're an angry mob?
[02:22:24.566 --> 02:22:26.586]  When it's like, you are an angry mob!
[02:22:29.027 --> 02:22:30.987]  It's beyond the pot calling the kettle black.
[02:22:33.688 --> 02:22:40.209]  They have such hubris in their control over the media that they can
[02:22:41.744 --> 02:22:50.174]  In the same day, in the exact same moment even, punch you right in the nose, and then say, why are you blaming me for your nosebleed?
[02:22:51.856 --> 02:22:52.236]  Seriously!
[02:22:53.798 --> 02:22:59.225]  This is like somebody walks right up to you in the street, and socks you in the nose, and makes your nose bleed,
[02:23:00.526 --> 02:23:05.968]  And then you're standing there, and your nose is bleeding, and you're like, like, hey man, what are you doing punching people in the nose?
[02:23:06.008 --> 02:23:08.288]  And he's, I'm not punching anyone in the nose, bro!
[02:23:08.308 --> 02:23:09.649]  Why are you making everyone afraid of me?
[02:23:10.069 --> 02:23:11.589]  I'm not violent, I didn't punch you!
[02:23:11.609 --> 02:23:17.291]  And you're like, I have, my friend was filming me, and this is a street camera, everyone caught it, everybody saw it.
[02:23:17.731 --> 02:23:19.191]  Look at this guy fear mongering!
[02:23:19.972 --> 02:23:21.452]  He's telling people I'm violent!
[02:23:21.812 --> 02:23:22.872]  Yeah, you punched me in the nose.
[02:23:23.172 --> 02:23:24.753]  Oh my gosh, he's fear mongering!
[02:23:25.691 --> 02:23:27.792]  I mean, this is next-level deception!
[02:23:27.852 --> 02:23:28.952]  This is unbelievable!
[02:23:29.272 --> 02:23:30.552]  And they all ran with the headline.
[02:23:30.732 --> 02:23:40.555]  So here they are, calling for violence, saying you're justified in your violence, get out of control, and then all the Democrats come out and say, the Republicans are fear-mongering.
[02:23:41.936 --> 02:23:44.896]  Uh, yeah, you're trying to kill us.
[02:23:51.578 --> 02:23:53.459]  It's just so next-level, I can't even...
[02:23:54.690 --> 02:24:04.796]  In fact, you know what, let's go out to Brazil, where they literally tried to kill Bolsonaro as they're in the middle of Operation, or they call it, Yava Jato, car wash.
[02:24:06.357 --> 02:24:09.219]  The last president is in jail, Lula.
[02:24:10.373 --> 02:24:18.701]  So, here's Brazil, getting its independence and sovereignty, draining their own swamp, they call it Operation Car Wash, Yava Jato, and so what do they do?
[02:24:18.901 --> 02:24:21.204]  They stab Bolsonaro, try to kill him!
[02:24:21.224 --> 02:24:24.247]  That's like, that's like Bolsonaro coming out and saying...
[02:24:25.609 --> 02:24:28.250]  Yes, my political opponents are getting violent.
[02:24:28.670 --> 02:24:32.092]  And then the Brazilian news says, Bolsonaro is fear-mongering!
[02:24:32.552 --> 02:24:34.593]  The guy got stabbed almost to death!
[02:24:35.533 --> 02:24:36.714]  Let's go to Gabriel in Brazil.
[02:24:36.794 --> 02:24:37.775]  Huge elections coming up.
[02:24:37.835 --> 02:24:40.896]  It looks like Bolsonaro is a shoe-in right now, but what do you think, Gabriel?
[02:24:47.659 --> 02:24:48.599]  Do we still have Gabriel?
[02:24:48.619 --> 02:24:49.620]  I'm not hearing any audio.
[02:24:52.008 --> 02:24:52.909]  Well, that's unfortunate.
[02:24:53.409 --> 02:24:53.509]  Okay.
[02:24:53.529 --> 02:24:54.710]  Can you hear me now?
[02:24:54.850 --> 02:24:56.131]  Okay, there you go, sir.
[02:24:56.311 --> 02:24:56.792]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:24:56.812 --> 02:24:57.793]  I wanted to tell you guys.
[02:24:59.194 --> 02:24:59.474]  Go ahead.
[02:25:02.576 --> 02:25:02.877]  Hello?
[02:25:03.677 --> 02:25:07.200]  Alright, I think we have a connection issue here because I guess Gabriel can't hear me.
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:08.761]  I can hear him now, but he can't hear me.
[02:25:08.781 --> 02:25:09.402]  Can you hear me?
[02:25:10.102 --> 02:25:11.203]  Alright, well that's too bad.
[02:25:11.383 --> 02:25:14.986]  Let's go to... If you guys want to see if you can get him back connected.
[02:25:15.046 --> 02:25:17.848]  In the meantime, let's go to Elizabeth in North Carolina.
[02:25:17.888 --> 02:25:18.429]  Go ahead, Elizabeth.
[02:25:20.333 --> 02:25:36.543]  I just wanted to tell you that I'm so annoyed because I think when Hillary came out the other day and said there would be no civility until the Democrats get back in power, she's trying to make people afraid because, you know, all of the chaos that's going on.
[02:25:36.763 --> 02:25:39.444]  She wants them to be scared so they'll just go ahead.
[02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:40.525]  Oh my gosh, exactly!
[02:25:40.985 --> 02:25:42.886]  I'm so glad you said that because it is next level.
[02:25:43.867 --> 02:25:45.348]  They're the ones fear mongering!
[02:25:50.845 --> 02:25:51.545]  It's unbelievable.
[02:25:53.326 --> 02:25:54.227]  They're fear-mongering.
[02:25:55.067 --> 02:25:55.947]  They're getting violent.
[02:25:56.888 --> 02:25:59.949]  And then you say, hey, the left is getting violent.
[02:25:59.989 --> 02:26:02.190]  We need to make sure we vote and keep them out of office.
[02:26:02.230 --> 02:26:03.891]  And then they say, oh my God, you're fear-mongering.
[02:26:04.331 --> 02:26:08.353]  And can you imagine, Elizabeth, if President Trump said what Hillary Clinton said?
[02:26:08.633 --> 02:26:14.416]  Imagine if President Trump went on Fox News and said, well, you know, we're just, there's just no civility until we have a red wave.
[02:26:14.636 --> 02:26:16.697]  Can you imagine what the press would say about that?
[02:26:19.331 --> 02:26:26.236]  But I want to tell you, Dr. Savage made a video or a clip, a sound clip, I was listening to his radio station.
[02:26:26.276 --> 02:26:27.457]  It's been back in the summer.
[02:26:28.097 --> 02:26:30.519]  And I think it was from like Homeland or something.
[02:26:30.959 --> 02:26:39.485]  And it reminded him, it was like a government official, like making these small, subtle threats to a man that sounded like Alex Jones.
[02:26:40.265 --> 02:26:45.129]  And I thought you guys might pick up on it, but I know you're so busy, but I wanted to tell you about that.
[02:26:45.569 --> 02:26:47.350]  He played this, and it really did.
[02:26:47.370 --> 02:26:49.752]  It was like he was threatening him to be quiet.
[02:26:50.112 --> 02:26:53.415]  Yeah, I think we even have the clip at Infowars.com.
[02:26:53.495 --> 02:26:56.137]  I mean, that character in Homeland is based off Alex Jones.
[02:26:56.627 --> 02:27:05.650]  Yeah, and so anyway, I'm sure I didn't know that you knew about Dr. Savage playing that clip and kind of hinting that it put him in mind of Alex.
[02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:12.332]  Well, I'll tell you, you know, if there's any two kindred spirits in conservative media, it's
[02:27:13.152 --> 02:27:15.853]  It's Mike Savage and Alex Jones.
[02:27:16.273 --> 02:27:20.355]  They're censored everywhere, they're not allowed on Fox News, and they just tell it like it is.
[02:27:20.395 --> 02:27:21.255]  They're not controlled.
[02:27:21.596 --> 02:27:23.516]  Love them or hate them, that's just the fact.
[02:27:23.556 --> 02:27:24.817]  Thank you so much for the call, Elizabeth.
[02:27:24.837 --> 02:27:29.639]  All right, let's give, okay, let's go to Ethan in Kansas.
[02:27:29.659 --> 02:27:30.239]  Go ahead, Ethan.
[02:27:31.860 --> 02:27:32.820]  Great to talk to you, Owen.
[02:27:34.221 --> 02:27:35.601]  Got a quote for you here.
[02:27:35.621 --> 02:27:42.164]  As far as the Info Wars Army goes, and people being maybe afraid or holding back on getting involved,
[02:27:42.711 --> 02:27:43.211]  The quote goes
[02:28:13.566 --> 02:28:15.286]  Both one of these people getting in their face.
[02:28:15.787 --> 02:28:19.867]  You know, I was called a rapist, I was called, you know, everything under the sun.
[02:28:20.087 --> 02:28:21.968]  You and your brother have been very active, right?
[02:28:22.868 --> 02:28:23.088]  Yes.
[02:28:23.168 --> 02:28:24.768]  You guys got on Monday Night Football, right?
[02:28:25.649 --> 02:28:26.489]  Yeah, that's us.
[02:28:26.509 --> 02:28:27.129]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:27.169 --> 02:28:29.329]  So guys, these guys are awesome.
[02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:35.391]  There's so many guys like Ethan out there that are going out every day engaging in activism, even if it's only for an hour.
[02:28:35.831 --> 02:28:38.271]  And we're retweeting it at InfoWarsArmy.
[02:28:38.311 --> 02:28:41.592]  We're putting stuff at InfoWarsArmy.com, but I mean, it's all on you.
[02:28:45.612 --> 02:28:47.253]  Your season has come to an end.
[02:28:47.353 --> 02:28:48.534]  A new season is here.
[02:28:48.694 --> 02:28:51.496]  Because we know humanity faces big challenges soon.
[02:28:51.536 --> 02:28:52.657]  We have to get ready for those.
[02:28:52.877 --> 02:28:54.238]  We have to get ready to make the jump.
[02:28:54.298 --> 02:28:56.980]  The time for this solar system is coming to an end.
[02:28:57.181 --> 02:28:58.141]  Everything counts down.
[02:28:58.341 --> 02:28:59.282]  Everything's been laid out.
[02:28:59.362 --> 02:29:01.264]  You've got maybe a hundred years to make the jump.
[02:29:01.304 --> 02:29:04.126]  The evil resonates with these low-level people to try to freeze us here.
[02:29:04.146 --> 02:29:14.053]  And then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and then, and
[02:29:14.193 --> 02:29:14.553]  Purity.
[02:29:14.834 --> 02:29:18.497]  And by purity I mean not pious purity, but genetic purity.
[02:29:19.097 --> 02:29:28.645]  In the raw, primordial system they came from, their will has a dimensional weight that punches through anything these statements do.
[02:29:29.105 --> 02:29:30.286]  We just have to call upon it.
[02:29:30.727 --> 02:29:34.790]  And to these fallen individuals, the will of humanity is a very frightening thing.
[02:29:35.130 --> 02:29:36.651]  It is frightening.
[02:29:37.072 --> 02:29:37.952]  It's the fear of God.
[02:29:38.173 --> 02:29:39.554]  God fashioned us.
[02:29:40.214 --> 02:29:41.175]  Made us in his image.
[02:29:41.535 --> 02:29:43.377]  Knew us before we were in our mother's womb.
[02:29:45.658 --> 02:29:49.259]  God created these enemies to test his people.
[02:29:49.739 --> 02:29:54.181]  Once you step past them, all of eternity is before you, and it's all a giant loop.
[02:29:54.361 --> 02:29:56.721]  You're like, the past, the present, the future, all of it.
[02:29:56.761 --> 02:29:58.542]  You're like, it's not just the past, the present, the future.
[02:29:58.602 --> 02:30:00.403]  That's only one spectrum, third dimension.
[02:30:00.463 --> 02:30:05.164]  Then you can delve as deep as you want to go, and you're like, the Satanists want to serve this?
[02:30:05.344 --> 02:30:08.145]  Why, the secrets of Satanism take 30 seconds to know.
[02:30:08.345 --> 02:30:14.447]  To even look into the heights of higher dimensions in God is just, is Valhalla.
[02:30:14.847 --> 02:30:28.382]  The next level and then you wonder how could they do this because they were given power in this dimension and that's what this is a cosmic con game coming to an end and it doesn't mean some utopia comes after this.
[02:30:28.823 --> 02:30:29.844]  That is not what's gonna happen.
[02:30:30.525 --> 02:30:32.206]  It's simply the next level.
[02:30:32.567 --> 02:30:35.851]  We'll laugh together when we are at the next level together.
[02:30:37.168 --> 02:30:38.469]  We were worried about that!
[02:30:38.749 --> 02:30:39.629]  Look at that!
[02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:41.190]  Because nothing is given.
[02:30:41.591 --> 02:30:43.111]  Everything has to be achieved.
[02:30:43.232 --> 02:30:44.512]  Well, that sounds fantastical.
[02:30:44.913 --> 02:30:46.373]  Have you looked where you are?
[02:30:46.694 --> 02:30:47.934]  You're at the weigh station.
[02:30:48.755 --> 02:30:51.276]  You're at the lily pad, the big pond.
[02:30:51.496 --> 02:30:54.078]  And out beyond is the mountains and the sky.
[02:30:54.718 --> 02:30:55.639]  The universe.
[02:30:55.699 --> 02:30:57.660]  It's endless, the potential God's given you.
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.101]  But it's free will.
[02:30:59.261 --> 02:31:02.563]  But it's very freeing once you have stared over the misty mountains.
[02:31:03.383 --> 02:31:04.284]  Once you have seen
[02:31:05.165 --> 02:31:08.228]  The potential, and no, there's really good in the universe, not just evil.
[02:31:08.628 --> 02:31:15.776]  It's a great comfort to know no matter what happens to these little frail bodies, these ugly things, that there's a bigger plan.
[02:31:16.096 --> 02:31:22.222]  Once you get it, you're like, oh my god, this demon thing is telling me how corrupt I am because I have a conscience and I know I'm not perfect.
[02:31:22.503 --> 02:31:23.003]  So I'm listening.
[02:31:23.063 --> 02:31:23.784]  Oh yeah, I want to do better.
[02:31:23.804 --> 02:31:24.124]  You're right.
[02:31:24.465 --> 02:31:25.105]  But it's a lie.
[02:31:25.846 --> 02:31:35.134]  And once you don't listen to the devil, the accuser, always accusing you, always telling you how you're bad, always telling you how you're failed, always telling you how you're ugly, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, because it knows you've got a soul.
[02:31:35.454 --> 02:31:36.875]  It knows you've got that pain.
[02:31:36.935 --> 02:31:48.705]  It can, it can hack that, it can send, it doesn't have that, but it knows you've got it, so it just keeps telling you how you're a Nazi, and how you're this, and how you're that, and how you're falling, and how you're, so you kind of get off balance and give it your power, when the minute
[02:31:49.961 --> 02:31:54.943]  You go, I'm not perfect, but I love God, and I want justice, and I want a future, and I want whatever the next level is.
[02:31:54.983 --> 02:31:55.864]  My God, I can feel it.
[02:31:56.084 --> 02:31:57.004]  Whatever it is, it's good.
[02:31:57.044 --> 02:31:58.405]  I want to go up, not down.
[02:31:58.765 --> 02:31:59.145]  You're free.
[02:32:00.646 --> 02:32:06.108]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up here.
[02:32:12.004 --> 02:32:16.348]  We have the new t-shirt we're selling because they have Impeach Trump 45 at Walmart.
[02:32:16.368 --> 02:32:19.410]  We have Reelect Trump at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:19.430 --> 02:32:20.471]  Reelect 45.
[02:32:21.331 --> 02:32:24.113]  So it's Reelect, not the other one.
[02:32:24.134 --> 02:32:25.294]  That's now exclusively available.
[02:32:25.434 --> 02:32:27.016]  They're getting printed right here, right here in Texas.
[02:32:27.336 --> 02:32:28.137]  Shipped out next week.
[02:32:28.157 --> 02:32:28.897]  Get your order in now.
[02:32:29.097 --> 02:32:29.978]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:29.998 --> 02:32:30.598]  No reviews yet.
[02:32:30.618 --> 02:32:31.279]  We just launched today.
[02:32:31.299 --> 02:32:33.841]  And then we have, we have Mean Like a Wolverine.
[02:32:33.861 --> 02:32:35.222]  It's not the Marvel comic book.
[02:32:35.362 --> 02:32:36.083]  Wimpy Wolverine.
[02:32:36.103 --> 02:32:37.205]  It's the Trump Wolverine.
[02:32:37.465 --> 02:32:39.407]  That's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:39.568 --> 02:32:41.630]  Be sure and get those and find the operation.
[02:32:46.076 --> 02:32:48.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:58.371 --> 02:33:04.256]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[02:33:04.916 --> 02:33:06.538]  It's Owen Troyer.
[02:33:07.178 --> 02:33:09.961]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:11.362 --> 02:33:16.926]  So, you have the Democrats fear-mongering, and then claiming the Republicans are fear-mongering.
[02:33:17.747 --> 02:33:24.392]  Well, yeah, we're just letting you know the truth, that the Democrats get elected, they're gonna raise your taxes, and they're gonna open the borders.
[02:33:25.753 --> 02:33:26.414]  That's just a fact.
[02:33:26.434 --> 02:33:27.715]  It's not fear-mongering.
[02:33:29.807 --> 02:33:31.889]  But, let's just look at some of these headlines.
[02:33:32.829 --> 02:33:38.774]  Nancy Pelosi warns hundreds of thousands of people will die if GOP health bill passes.
[02:33:39.094 --> 02:33:39.215]  Oh!
[02:33:40.055 --> 02:33:40.516]  Here's another one.
[02:33:41.196 --> 02:33:46.720]  Economist Larry Summers, 10,000 people will die annually from GOP tax bill.
[02:33:46.761 --> 02:33:47.041]  Oh wow!
[02:33:49.028 --> 02:33:49.828]  And then there's this one.
[02:33:50.329 --> 02:33:55.911]  Here's an entire list of times Democrats claim GOP policies would cause people to die.
[02:33:56.351 --> 02:34:01.113]  And this is like a, it's like five, six, seven pages here, seven pages of the list.
[02:34:01.213 --> 02:34:05.695]  So I don't have time to go into all of it, but this is, you know, this is normal for the Democrat Party.
[02:34:05.915 --> 02:34:06.675]  It's what they always do.
[02:34:06.695 --> 02:34:09.376]  In fact, they ran an ad, I think it was back in the nineties.
[02:34:09.396 --> 02:34:11.677]  You can probably find this on the internet.
[02:34:12.078 --> 02:34:17.820]  They ran an ad where they, it was a Democrat paid for ad, where they literally push granny off a cliff.
[02:34:20.188 --> 02:34:31.217]  And they claim that this is what the Republicans are doing to, I think it was either Social Security or Medicaid, I don't remember, and they have a whole ad, and it's a Republican pushing a grandma off a cliff.
[02:34:33.039 --> 02:34:37.443]  So this is not, this isn't new hat for the Democratic Party, this is old hat.
[02:34:38.604 --> 02:34:43.588]  They are the party of fear mongering, they are the party of racism, they are the party of violence.
[02:34:45.583 --> 02:34:54.331]  And the nerve, the unmitigated nerve, the audacity of these people to go on television and say, Trump is fear-mongering and the Republicans are the party of violence.
[02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:57.233]  You, you two-faced phony liars.
[02:34:59.175 --> 02:35:01.037]  The good news is the American people are seeing through it.
[02:35:01.237 --> 02:35:01.817]  Yeah, here it is.
[02:35:02.158 --> 02:35:02.758]  Here's the ad.
[02:35:04.240 --> 02:35:05.661]  Oh yeah, and here's little granny.
[02:35:06.562 --> 02:35:08.864]  And it's the nice Republican pushing her off the cliff.
[02:35:10.359 --> 02:35:12.060]  It's the Democrats fear-mongering for you.
[02:35:12.200 --> 02:35:13.361]  Oh no, but it's the Republicans!
[02:35:13.401 --> 02:35:17.464]  The Democrats told me, right after they told me Trump was gonna kill me and put me in a cage!
[02:35:19.585 --> 02:35:20.826]  Jesus, I tell ya.
[02:35:21.587 --> 02:35:22.707]  These people are nuts, man.
[02:35:25.009 --> 02:35:26.950]  Alright, let's go back out to the phone lines.
[02:35:27.270 --> 02:35:30.312]  We've got Kent in Alabama.
[02:35:30.393 --> 02:35:31.173]  Fire away, Kent.
[02:35:33.795 --> 02:35:35.016]  Oh, and much respect, dude.
[02:35:35.036 --> 02:35:36.316]  Thanks for taking the call.
[02:35:36.357 --> 02:35:38.378]  Hey, I gotta say that
[02:35:40.083 --> 02:35:55.918]  You have a new t-shirt or meme on your hands with the Maxine Waters James Brown thought process because you on one side you have I got soul and I'm super bad with James and on the back you have Maxine with I've got your soul and I'm super bad.
[02:35:55.938 --> 02:35:57.560]  But anyway.
[02:35:57.720 --> 02:36:03.886]  Or just on the front it's James Brown and it's I've got soul and then on the back it's Maxine Waters I'm super bad.
[02:36:06.027 --> 02:36:06.727]  Right on, dude.
[02:36:07.107 --> 02:36:07.848]  Any of the above.
[02:36:08.648 --> 02:36:09.789]  Just follow that lead.
[02:36:09.829 --> 02:36:10.589]  You're on point there.
[02:36:10.869 --> 02:36:11.990]  Hey, you guys follow that lead.
[02:36:12.030 --> 02:36:13.411]  It's just like with the Infowars Army, man.
[02:36:13.471 --> 02:36:15.031]  We got our hands full here.
[02:36:15.091 --> 02:36:16.292]  I'm not discounting your idea.
[02:36:16.312 --> 02:36:16.812]  It's a great idea.
[02:36:17.213 --> 02:36:18.553]  People should go out and make the t-shirt.
[02:36:18.573 --> 02:36:20.474]  You come out with a great idea, make the t-shirt.
[02:36:20.574 --> 02:36:21.415]  Put Infowars on it.
[02:36:21.735 --> 02:36:22.716]  Say it's an Infowars t-shirt.
[02:36:22.736 --> 02:36:23.156]  It'll sell.
[02:36:24.261 --> 02:36:25.121]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:36:25.141 --> 02:36:29.962]  The InfoWars Army is so amazing because people like Ethan, who called in last segment, have just gone out there and done it.
[02:36:30.142 --> 02:36:33.103]  He goes out there every day and engages in political activism.
[02:36:33.123 --> 02:36:34.824]  He got the sign on the Monday night football game.
[02:36:35.004 --> 02:36:39.665]  There's people in Missouri, people in Portland that are going out every day in Trump hats in the middle of Portland.
[02:36:39.685 --> 02:36:43.626]  I mean, you know, that's risky, but that's, you know, that's what it takes.
[02:36:43.646 --> 02:36:44.306]  A little bravery.
[02:36:44.346 --> 02:36:44.906]  Go ahead, Kent.
[02:36:45.306 --> 02:36:46.286]  Yeah.
[02:36:46.366 --> 02:36:47.607]  Grassroots, dude, no doubt.
[02:36:47.647 --> 02:36:48.647]  You got it going on.
[02:36:48.707 --> 02:36:53.708]  So, you know, the whole point of the Kanye scenario and the left and the demon crats, these people that
[02:36:54.246 --> 02:36:58.267]  Because if you're not a Democrat, a progressive, or a liberal, you're a racist, bigot, rapist.
[02:36:58.288 --> 02:36:59.908]  I mean, what don't you get?
[02:37:19.696 --> 02:37:21.457]  And you didn't read when you were growing up.
[02:37:22.517 --> 02:37:23.738]  Oh yeah, that's the new one.
[02:37:23.758 --> 02:37:24.658]  You don't read either now.
[02:37:24.778 --> 02:37:25.358]  Okay, yeah.
[02:37:26.439 --> 02:37:27.159]  You're uneducated.
[02:37:27.379 --> 02:37:28.980]  But I guess that's really just rehashing.
[02:37:29.260 --> 02:37:31.061]  They've really been saying that the whole time.
[02:37:31.121 --> 02:37:33.622]  It's just a new way of saying that we're uneducated.
[02:37:34.827 --> 02:37:39.050]  Well, yeah, but also look at the fact that they don't say anything about Taylor Swift.
[02:37:39.090 --> 02:37:39.671]  They love her.
[02:37:39.791 --> 02:37:40.612]  Oh, much love, Taylor.
[02:37:40.652 --> 02:37:41.612]  You came out for the left.
[02:37:41.672 --> 02:37:42.713]  You love the Demoncrats.
[02:37:42.833 --> 02:37:51.020]  Oh, and guess who won an award at a music award ceremony 24 hours after Taylor Swift said that?
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:51.900]  Guess who won?
[02:37:54.422 --> 02:37:55.103]  No idea, dude.
[02:37:55.343 --> 02:37:56.104]  Taylor Swift.
[02:37:58.125 --> 02:37:58.746]  Of course.
[02:37:59.026 --> 02:38:00.287]  Now you see.
[02:38:00.547 --> 02:38:01.288]  Exactly.
[02:38:01.828 --> 02:38:02.429]  Exactly.
[02:38:03.228 --> 02:38:06.873]  And now she'll get whatever, a Netflix special and her songs on the radio.
[02:38:06.893 --> 02:38:12.982]  They just say, look Taylor, we just need you to come out and do something for the Democrats.
[02:38:13.303 --> 02:38:16.487]  We'll give you the AMA award and we'll put your next track on the radio.
[02:38:16.608 --> 02:38:16.948]  Okay?
[02:38:17.168 --> 02:38:18.851]  And Taylor Swift says, okay.
[02:38:21.778 --> 02:38:27.300]  It's crazy because she's the American hero now for the left, and she's just, you know... Well, she's hardly anything but.
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:28.520]  I would disagree.
[02:38:28.540 --> 02:38:31.441]  She's hardly anything but, but it just proves she's a sellout just like everything else.
[02:38:31.661 --> 02:38:34.542]  And here's the sad thing about it that most people don't realize.
[02:38:34.622 --> 02:38:35.182]  Trump got it.
[02:38:35.502 --> 02:38:36.382]  Thank you for the call, Kent.
[02:38:36.722 --> 02:38:37.662]  Kanye West gets it.
[02:38:39.103 --> 02:38:40.263]  I guess Taylor Swift didn't get it.
[02:38:41.003 --> 02:38:43.064]  Taylor, you don't need these people.
[02:38:43.905 --> 02:38:45.246]  Like, that's what they don't get.
[02:38:45.386 --> 02:38:46.046]  Trump gets it.
[02:38:46.466 --> 02:38:47.266]  Kanye gets it.
[02:38:47.487 --> 02:38:48.147]  Candace Owen gets it.
[02:38:48.187 --> 02:38:49.027]  Like, people get it.
[02:38:49.588 --> 02:38:50.488]  Some people don't get it.
[02:38:50.528 --> 02:38:52.169]  They really think they need these people.
[02:38:52.849 --> 02:38:54.670]  Taylor Swift writes her own music.
[02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:58.331]  She's going to be worth more than Michael Jackson when it's all said and done.
[02:38:59.492 --> 02:39:01.253]  She produces her own songs.
[02:39:02.290 --> 02:39:05.191]  She writes her own lyrics, so she's making so much money.
[02:39:05.231 --> 02:39:06.671]  She's so smart in the music industry.
[02:39:06.912 --> 02:39:08.632]  She doesn't need any of these people.
[02:39:08.672 --> 02:39:09.973]  She doesn't need the AMAs.
[02:39:10.193 --> 02:39:13.694]  She doesn't need the radio stations, corporate radio playing her tracks.
[02:39:13.954 --> 02:39:17.615]  She sells out concerts like 500 bucks a head in a minute.
[02:39:18.295 --> 02:39:19.636]  She doesn't need this crap!
[02:39:19.956 --> 02:39:22.017]  But they have this weird phobia.
[02:39:22.997 --> 02:39:27.518]  If they don't have the establishment behind them, that they can't make it and they'll be destroyed.
[02:39:27.818 --> 02:39:29.259]  No, it only makes you more powerful.
[02:39:31.496 --> 02:39:32.716]  Let's take another call.
[02:39:32.836 --> 02:39:34.437]  Dean in Virginia.
[02:39:34.737 --> 02:39:35.397]  Go ahead, Dean.
[02:39:36.758 --> 02:39:37.418]  Well, thanks Owen.
[02:39:37.438 --> 02:39:42.720]  The great thing about being on hold, you're able to expand on your points that you brought up.
[02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:52.663]  One of my first points, questions is, can President Trump issue an executive order that in order to vote, you need a photo ID?
[02:39:55.524 --> 02:39:56.424]  You know, that's interesting.
[02:39:58.260 --> 02:39:58.680]  I don't know.
[02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:01.882]  I think that technically that's already the case though.
[02:40:01.902 --> 02:40:08.886]  I don't know if you have to present it at the polling station, but technically you do have to have a photo ID to vote.
[02:40:08.966 --> 02:40:12.928]  I mean, at some point you have to get the photo ID to eventually vote, you know what I'm saying?
[02:40:13.429 --> 02:40:16.971]  But I guess presenting it at the polling station is a different story.
[02:40:17.791 --> 02:40:18.471]  And enforcing it.
[02:40:19.032 --> 02:40:21.113]  They won't even let him ask on the U.S.
[02:40:21.193 --> 02:40:22.934]  Census if you're an American citizen!
[02:40:26.001 --> 02:40:27.242]  You got the census coming for 2020.
[02:40:27.542 --> 02:40:30.424]  He proposed putting the question, are you a U.S.
[02:40:30.464 --> 02:40:30.824]  citizen?
[02:40:31.104 --> 02:40:31.545]  And you know what?
[02:40:31.565 --> 02:40:32.525]  They said, no, you can't do that.
[02:40:35.167 --> 02:40:36.348]  There you go, more cutting back.
[02:40:36.628 --> 02:40:38.569]  I got another point for you.
[02:40:38.689 --> 02:40:42.812]  At the hearings, remember you heard all those paid agitators screaming and yelling?
[02:40:42.832 --> 02:40:45.834]  Yeah, it sounded like demonic screams from hell.
[02:40:45.854 --> 02:40:53.559]  I found out from a local radio guy that those were homeless people bused from Union Station
[02:40:54.318 --> 02:40:56.499]  A cop said that to him when he asked, where are all the homeless people?
[02:40:56.519 --> 02:40:57.460]  Because I see them coming in.
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:00.282]  I see them all over the place when I come in from out of town.
[02:41:00.722 --> 02:41:02.223]  Well, they were bused over to the hearings.
[02:41:03.004 --> 02:41:03.444]  Number one.
[02:41:03.924 --> 02:41:09.027]  Number two, isn't it true that in order to get into these hearings, you have to have a ticket?
[02:41:09.708 --> 02:41:11.669]  Oh, I'm so glad you said this, Dean.
[02:41:12.249 --> 02:41:16.032]  I don't know, 110% they were all invited in by the Democrats.
[02:41:16.852 --> 02:41:16.032]  110%.
[02:41:16.872 --> 02:41:22.216]  To get a ticket, one of the demon rat aides has to give it to them.
[02:41:22.456 --> 02:41:22.596]  Yep.
[02:41:23.194 --> 02:41:24.215]  They'll never admit this.
[02:41:24.455 --> 02:41:25.596]  They'll never admit this.
[02:41:25.876 --> 02:41:26.937]  It's 100% true.
[02:41:27.177 --> 02:41:29.819]  They were all invited in by the Democrat Party.
[02:41:30.139 --> 02:41:32.040]  And this was something you have to plan weeks in advance.
[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:33.421]  You can't just invite someone in that day.
[02:41:33.461 --> 02:41:33.621]  Correct.
[02:41:33.641 --> 02:41:34.742]  They've been planning this.
[02:41:35.723 --> 02:41:36.563]  Now, here's the other point.
[02:41:37.444 --> 02:41:41.847]  Once they're being brought out because they're disruptive and they handcuff them with the plastic ties.
[02:41:42.447 --> 02:41:45.429]  However, they are still shooting off their weapon.
[02:41:45.469 --> 02:41:47.150]  They're still shooting off their mouth.
[02:41:47.631 --> 02:41:48.932]  Why don't they do?
[02:41:49.232 --> 02:41:49.772]  Why don't they act?
[02:41:49.812 --> 02:41:52.394]  And the first thing they do is duct tape their mouth.
[02:41:53.700 --> 02:41:58.124]  Well, you know, that's probably not good optics.
[02:42:00.467 --> 02:42:08.875]  I would say that, for real though, I mean, I don't know if you're serious about that, but I think a real solution... I'm serious about it because they're still acting, they're still screaming and yelling, so what's the point of arresting them?
[02:42:08.955 --> 02:42:10.937]  Well, they're really not even being arrested.
[02:42:10.977 --> 02:42:12.339]  They're being executed out and...
[02:42:15.419 --> 02:42:17.841]  Excuse me, they're being let out and they're being asked, do you mind?
[02:42:17.861 --> 02:42:19.403]  I like that word though.
[02:42:19.903 --> 02:42:21.064]  Do you mind if we arrest you?
[02:42:21.084 --> 02:42:22.085]  Do you mind?
[02:42:22.446 --> 02:42:24.147]  So they just really need to do it.
[02:42:24.287 --> 02:42:25.829]  Alright, serious deal folks.
[02:42:25.869 --> 02:42:26.890]  Coming up, thank you for the call Dean.
[02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:29.352]  Big report from Alex Jones after this break.
[02:42:29.372 --> 02:42:30.273]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[02:42:30.633 --> 02:42:32.795]  Big report from Alex Jones on the other side of this break.
[02:42:33.115 --> 02:42:34.757]  Then we're joined by Roger Stone on the fourth hour.
[02:42:34.797 --> 02:42:36.719]  But Alex Jones is coming up with a breaking report.
[02:42:36.939 --> 02:42:39.061]  This is the Alex Jones Show, filling in for Alex Lamo and Troyer.
[02:42:39.081 --> 02:42:39.882]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:47.543 --> 02:42:48.143]  Did you hear?
[02:42:48.524 --> 02:42:49.964]  Christmas is coming in October.
[02:42:50.505 --> 02:42:51.985]  Black Friday's coming in October.
[02:42:52.526 --> 02:42:54.166]  Cyber Monday's coming in October.
[02:42:54.227 --> 02:42:58.049]  What's really coming in October is incredible deals.
[02:42:58.069 --> 02:43:00.970]  50% off at InfoWarsTour.com and free shipping.
[02:43:01.710 --> 02:43:08.854]  And it's all to stand up against the censors that are really pushing to shut down InfoWars.com and to shut down your voice.
[02:43:09.554 --> 02:43:14.257]  Now, I'm sure that you've seen that they want InfoWars to go the way of the Dodo bird.
[02:43:15.438 --> 02:43:18.920]  By the way, the dinosaurs, because they themselves are collapsing and going that direction.
[02:43:20.181 --> 02:43:29.928]  You've seen massive corporate demonization and lies about us, and you've seen the attempts to take our sponsors away and to be able to take our banking away, so we can't even process orders.
[02:43:30.588 --> 02:43:35.351]  This is a concerted, un-American, cartel, mafia operation.
[02:43:35.432 --> 02:43:40.495]  And now, as we enter the middle of October 2018, it has intensified.
[02:43:42.176 --> 02:43:55.508]  Now we have major stockpiles of incredibly high quality supplements, t-shirts, books, films, air filtration, water filtration, you name it, built up for Black Friday, and of course for Cyber Monday, and for Christmas!
[02:43:56.088 --> 02:44:00.292]  But I'm not even 100% confident we'll be able to engage in commerce then.
[02:44:01.413 --> 02:44:06.778]  So that's why, with this concerted effort of the globals coming out on us, that Christmas is coming early.
[02:44:07.198 --> 02:44:08.279]  Black Friday's coming early.
[02:44:09.159 --> 02:44:10.340]  Cyber Monday's coming up.
[02:44:10.460 --> 02:44:16.442]  All those sales we had planned for the next two months are now condensed into starting now.
[02:44:17.022 --> 02:44:22.404]  And until things sell out, or until we are successful, or until they shut us down, who the hell knows?
[02:44:23.264 --> 02:44:30.927]  The point is, is they're moving against us everywhere and licking their lips to shut down our self-funded operation that is here because of you.
[02:44:31.627 --> 02:44:33.748]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[02:44:34.972 --> 02:44:40.314]  InfoWars has always been in your hands, and we were the number one media organization in the world.
[02:44:40.514 --> 02:44:44.936]  After Drudge Report, when it came to video and audio, number one in the election of Trump.
[02:44:45.376 --> 02:44:50.018]  And so they shadow banned us, and they took our sponsors, and they wouldn't let us advertise, and they strangled us.
[02:44:50.579 --> 02:44:53.740]  And still, because of you getting the word out, we were dominating.
[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:59.322]  And so now they're coming after our ability, InfoWarsTore.com, to even have credit card processing.
[02:44:59.362 --> 02:45:02.604]  But we've got it, we've got backups, but they're like a mafia targeting those.
[02:45:03.644 --> 02:45:04.345]  Get your X2.
[02:45:04.485 --> 02:45:07.848]  Even though it's selling out in the last run, 50% off!
[02:45:08.208 --> 02:45:09.449]  Rainforest, selling out, 50% off!
[02:45:09.469 --> 02:45:11.891]  Supermellow Vitality, 50% off!
[02:45:12.592 --> 02:45:14.073]  Every supplement, 50% off.
[02:45:14.153 --> 02:45:16.616]  Now, I do that with air filtration and water filtration.
[02:45:16.976 --> 02:45:20.399]  They don't even have 50% markup takeoff, but they're discounted as well.
[02:45:20.659 --> 02:45:24.843]  And, free shipping, store-wide, mformorestore.com.
[02:45:25.163 --> 02:45:27.685]  So, this is the October
[02:45:29.226 --> 02:45:30.647]  Black Friday coming early.
[02:45:31.047 --> 02:45:32.208]  This is Christmas coming early.
[02:45:32.608 --> 02:45:34.169]  This is Cyber Monday coming early.
[02:45:34.289 --> 02:45:36.331]  This is Christmas in October.
[02:45:36.911 --> 02:45:39.993]  Get the great supplements you already love and need that you know are great.
[02:45:40.073 --> 02:45:40.914]  The five-star ratings.
[02:45:41.414 --> 02:45:42.915]  And go ahead and buy your Christmas gifts.
[02:45:43.615 --> 02:45:44.456]  So that you have them.
[02:45:44.616 --> 02:45:45.897]  Don't have to fight traffic.
[02:45:45.917 --> 02:45:47.117]  Christmas is only two months away.
[02:45:47.137 --> 02:45:50.540]  And you can support the Emperor Award while getting great products and win-win.
[02:45:50.780 --> 02:45:51.620]  I'm counting on you.
[02:45:51.640 --> 02:45:52.581]  You've always come through.
[02:45:53.001 --> 02:45:54.162]  They know you always come through.
[02:45:54.462 --> 02:45:57.464]  Which is why they want to deny you the right and the ability
[02:45:58.124 --> 02:46:02.829]  With a five-star rated organization with the best banking scores and best credit you can have.
[02:46:02.849 --> 02:46:05.771]  I mean, our credit card rate's 2%.
[02:46:05.831 --> 02:46:06.552]  Nobody's got that.
[02:46:07.273 --> 02:46:08.134]  Credit card processing.
[02:46:08.554 --> 02:46:10.596]  They want to shut down because we're successful.
[02:46:10.876 --> 02:46:11.437]  We expose them.
[02:46:11.637 --> 02:46:15.581]  And now is your chance, more than ever, to step in and make sure we've got funds to go into the next year.

[02:46:32.632 --> 02:46:33.513]  I'm counting on you.
[02:46:33.793 --> 02:46:34.694]  You always come through.
[02:46:35.034 --> 02:46:35.795]  Take advantage of this.
[02:46:35.815 --> 02:46:37.957]  Let's make it our most successful sale ever.
[02:46:46.013 --> 02:46:48.736]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:54.142 --> 02:46:59.228]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:02.099 --> 02:47:06.864]  I have now confirmed that Hillary Clinton is planning to run in 2020 and they're going to hand her the nomination.
[02:47:07.305 --> 02:47:14.853]  That's why they're trying to shut down all the independent nationalist media ahead of time to clear the way for her to take Trump's legs out from under him.
[02:47:15.614 --> 02:47:17.957]  Stand by for this bombshell intel.
[02:47:25.632 --> 02:47:29.756]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a very important breaking news item.
[02:47:30.477 --> 02:47:42.609]  Now, we've heard rumors of this and we've seen even mainstream media report that Democrats are being told that Hillary is at least looking at running for president in 2020.
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:55.521]  Well, I've got it from high-level sources, but also sources very, very close to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and I'm going to stop right there, that indeed she is
[02:47:57.278 --> 02:47:57.798]  We're good to go.
[02:48:24.087 --> 02:48:28.508]  The Republicans tried the same thing on Trump, but it didn't work because we said, no, that's a fraud.
[02:48:28.908 --> 02:48:31.269]  They tried to sell the idea, but we revolted against it.
[02:48:31.629 --> 02:48:33.209]  But the Democrats are so controlled, they didn't.
[02:48:33.630 --> 02:48:41.252]  Now, I'm going to get to the big news here in a moment, but just setting the table for this, Hillary basically controls the Democratic Party.
[02:48:41.312 --> 02:48:43.412]  Soros funds about 80% of it.
[02:48:44.092 --> 02:48:46.393]  And then she's got a couple of billions still left in her foundation.
[02:48:47.875 --> 02:48:52.017]  It's legally hard for her to get that out and use it unless she uses some of it on the campaign.
[02:48:52.557 --> 02:49:01.520]  So she uses it for mansions and private jets and payoffs and things right now and financing lawsuits against me and trying to shut down the real American media.
[02:49:02.020 --> 02:49:05.061]  Ahead of her running in really about a year.
[02:49:05.782 --> 02:49:09.963]  So she would be announcing in about a year, maybe even sooner.
[02:49:10.023 --> 02:49:14.825]  Trump was smart to announce, what was it, six months ago to get ahead of all this.
[02:49:15.973 --> 02:49:20.335]  And to go ahead and start campaigning now, because in truth the campaign cycle never really ends.
[02:49:20.775 --> 02:49:21.635]  But here's the big news.
[02:49:23.136 --> 02:49:34.520]  I've talked to high-level Republicans, I've talked to high-level Democrats, and I've confirmed that because she has the money, she has the power, the Democratic Party is so authoritarian, that it doesn't matter if she can hardly walk.
[02:49:34.540 --> 02:49:36.321]  It doesn't matter if she has coughing fits everywhere.
[02:49:36.581 --> 02:49:39.302]  It doesn't matter if she looks like she's 20 years older than she is.
[02:49:39.342 --> 02:49:41.623]  It doesn't matter if she reportedly drinks a bottle of vodka every day.
[02:49:42.967 --> 02:49:47.932]  She's so arrogant, so power-grasping, just like Bill Clinton's looked like a corpse for 10 years.
[02:49:48.873 --> 02:49:56.301]  What keeps them alive is the thirst for power, the thirst to dominate America, and do the handover of America to the chi-coms and the globalists.
[02:49:56.741 --> 02:49:57.522]  Now here's the big news.
[02:49:59.324 --> 02:50:05.591]  I know a lot of people that obviously have done security for Hillary Clinton.
[02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:11.284]  And I know people currently that have very, very close connections to Hillary.
[02:50:12.024 --> 02:50:16.228]  And I happen to know some folks who don't like Hillary very much because of Benghazi.
[02:50:17.048 --> 02:50:17.829]  And I'll leave it at that.
[02:50:19.170 --> 02:50:32.721]  But I will tell you, just because the enemy already knows of what I speak being true, that the arrogance of Hillary being rude, not only to every security detail she's ever had, and I'll tell you about in a moment,
[02:50:34.141 --> 02:50:44.265]  But also being very, very rude and hateful to even senior people under her and senior people currently in the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:50:45.225 --> 02:50:55.529]  So I had the fourth person from the CIA yesterday, in person, tell me
[02:50:57.031 --> 02:51:02.093]  That they have confirmed that Hillary is running and basically giving the same intel that I just gave you.
[02:51:02.734 --> 02:51:05.195]  And these folks don't like her because, again, of Benghazi.
[02:51:05.495 --> 02:51:06.495]  And it wasn't Tonto.
[02:51:07.616 --> 02:51:08.596]  That's not who told me.
[02:51:08.616 --> 02:51:14.779]  But let's just say, because the enemy already knows all this stuff, that it was somebody who served with him.
[02:51:15.795 --> 02:51:19.116]  And this is the fourth person from the CIA.
[02:51:19.256 --> 02:51:33.879]  And when I say CIA, I mean the real CIA, not the leftist professor CIA where they just hand out little CIA cards to them all so they can feel powerful and let them dox everybody and let them have the database of antifa that tries to make you run them over in Portland.
[02:51:34.119 --> 02:51:34.819]  You're an old man.
[02:51:35.099 --> 02:51:36.999]  They then dox your car within minutes.
[02:51:37.399 --> 02:51:40.600]  They've got the police down the street uploading information.
[02:51:42.325 --> 02:51:48.548]  This information comes from the State Department, this information comes from the CIA, this information comes from the Secret Service.
[02:51:49.128 --> 02:52:01.395]  The same Secret Service that told us a month before Hillary fell down on 9-11 in 2016, look, we can't give you any classified info, but she's got a tent, she's having convulsions every 45 minutes on average,
[02:52:03.564 --> 02:52:09.288]  She's got a black ambulance, and if you just have reporters follow her, Alex, you will catch her collapse.
[02:52:10.008 --> 02:52:17.033]  Two weeks later, Billy Weaver caught him with her in a tent for over an hour, running in with emergency stretchers, and then she didn't even do the event.
[02:52:18.154 --> 02:52:22.137]  Then two weeks after that, she fell on her face like a sack of potatoes.
[02:52:24.058 --> 02:52:31.063]  The Secret Service said they threw her in the van, in the black ambulance, the camouflaged ambulance, like a sack of potatoes.
[02:52:32.475 --> 02:52:33.916]  The clandestine ambulance.
[02:52:34.177 --> 02:52:37.200]  So, she's even in worse health now than she was.
[02:52:37.240 --> 02:52:38.821]  She's had multiple brain surgeries.
[02:52:39.802 --> 02:52:41.684]  And she just treats everybody like crap.
[02:52:42.445 --> 02:52:47.189]  And we can sit around and we can laugh at Hillary and think about how pathetic this is, but remember why she thinks she can still win.
[02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:53.894]  She already wanted to shut down the independent media and the nationalist media once she got elected president.
[02:52:53.934 --> 02:52:58.036]  She'd given the Dark Heart speech about me and said they were going to shut down the quote fake news.
[02:52:58.336 --> 02:52:59.117]  That means the real news.
[02:52:59.917 --> 02:53:11.824]  But even though she lost, her stay-behind networks are still moving forward with this and big tech working with mainstream media is shutting down their competition not just out of the midterms but ahead of 2020.
[02:53:14.446 --> 02:53:24.511]  And so that's why she thinks that what Trump had to support him in 2016 won't be there when she announces, I'd say within the next year, maybe even eight months or so.
[02:53:25.071 --> 02:53:35.457]  So look for Hillary to announce within the next eight months to 12 months, and by then they'll have total censorship in place if Trump doesn't take action and move against this racketeering and this cartel.
[02:53:36.397 --> 02:53:52.789]  So that's why she's so incredibly arrogant and still thinks she can win because if we lay down, they could put her in there like Matt Drudge joked six, seven years ago as a floating brain in a jar with bubbles oxygenating her.
[02:53:53.389 --> 02:54:03.156]  So we're talking about a brain in a jar and the system ensconcing that as a sick joke against the titan that we have in there right now.
[02:54:03.536 --> 02:54:05.318]  So that's why this is so incredibly important.
[02:54:06.687 --> 02:54:10.748]  Now, I was first told this by Secret Service 10 years ago.
[02:54:12.529 --> 02:54:16.470]  I was then told about it by former Blackwater people, who were also CIA.
[02:54:16.570 --> 02:54:20.352]  And then I was told this by more State Department people.
[02:54:20.912 --> 02:54:25.193]  And then I was told this by federal police, U.S.
[02:54:25.253 --> 02:54:25.693]  Marshals.
[02:54:26.194 --> 02:54:27.334]  And then now I've been told about it
[02:54:28.803 --> 02:54:31.486]  From four different people from the CIA, okay?
[02:54:32.167 --> 02:54:40.158]  And I guess enough was thought of this yesterday for me to get the message with, let's just say, particular documentation.
[02:54:41.900 --> 02:54:45.484]  So this was, you know, information that you're meant to have.
[02:54:45.504 --> 02:54:46.486]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[02:54:47.898 --> 02:54:59.940]  That whenever they have a dog clear a hotel room or anywhere she was at at bases overseas, she would say, get that effing piece of crap out of here, you're a bunch of animals in the military, you're a bunch of scum, you're retards, don't even look me in the eyes.
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:05.901]  She would do this in briefings in the State Department and CIA, overseas and domestically.
[02:55:05.961 --> 02:55:08.942]  She is a monster, crazy person.
[02:55:09.482 --> 02:55:17.183]  When you see her walking around strutting with that big demon smile, I mean, she is a borderline personality disorder, total narcissistic psychotic.
[02:55:18.789 --> 02:55:22.713]  With absolute delusions of grandeur on an unlimited psychotic power trip.
[02:55:23.234 --> 02:55:25.216]  I mean, she is Medusa on PCP.
[02:55:26.137 --> 02:55:28.360]  And people are fed up with her.
[02:55:29.601 --> 02:55:34.026]  Now, she's been left alone because she's so damaging to the Democrats and so pathetic.
[02:55:34.566 --> 02:55:38.551]  Like Trump said, he goes to sleep every night and dreams of what pathetic weaklings these people are.
[02:55:40.214 --> 02:55:41.635]  And how he's going to crush him in 2020.
[02:55:41.675 --> 02:55:47.560]  The problem is, they're going after the low-hanging fruit, yours truly, Alex Jones, and trying to destroy me.
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:53.824]  And they've reached out with olive branches through New York Times operatives and others in the last two years.
[02:55:53.884 --> 02:56:01.530]  If I just leave Soros alone, and trying to confuse the gender of kids alone, and the Islamists alone, then I'll be left alone.
[02:56:02.251 --> 02:56:04.913]  Well, I know Beck got that same message four years ago, and he rolled over.
[02:56:05.413 --> 02:56:06.254]  I'm not rolling over.
[02:56:06.814 --> 02:56:07.675]  So just understand that.
[02:56:09.057 --> 02:56:14.156]  This is really huge news that I'm giving you, and basically it's now gotten to the point where...
[02:56:15.897 --> 02:56:17.778]  It's from the rooftops I'm being told this.
[02:56:18.358 --> 02:56:20.359]  And I'm being asked, why aren't you covering it?
[02:56:20.699 --> 02:56:21.899]  Why aren't you telling people?
[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:24.740]  And I'm like, okay, I'm gonna cover it, I'm gonna talk about it.
[02:56:25.121 --> 02:56:27.462]  But again, you can look at mainstream news where she's preparing this.
[02:56:27.862 --> 02:56:32.523]  But we have to get out ahead of this and just talk about how ridiculous and pathetic it is.
[02:56:33.304 --> 02:56:35.144]  And just how controlled the Democratic Party is.
[02:56:35.645 --> 02:56:40.206]  So that when she does run and do it all, it'll blow up their face even worse.
[02:56:41.027 --> 02:56:43.688]  Cuz they're gonna steal the nomination again.
[02:56:44.568 --> 02:56:47.970]  Which is going to make all their peoples not vote again or go vote for Trump.
[02:56:48.690 --> 02:56:50.991]  So we do have to battle the whole Taylor Swift phenomenon.
[02:56:52.152 --> 02:56:56.794]  All the propaganda she's involved in and the fact that, you know, she's kind of an ace in the hole for them.
[02:56:56.874 --> 02:57:03.858]  So let's not get too confident here, but things are going really, really well as humanity awakens and as the pro-human future develops.
[02:57:05.270 --> 02:57:06.751]  But, I'm gonna stop right there.
[02:57:07.331 --> 02:57:11.333]  I'm asking all of you right now to get this out to everyone you know.
[02:57:11.353 --> 02:57:15.535]  Now back to Owen Schroer in a live broadcast, thenfulwars.com forward slash show.
[02:57:15.575 --> 02:57:17.756]  If you don't get this information out, nobody will.
[02:57:18.016 --> 02:57:19.097]  I'm counting on you, folks.
[02:57:20.958 --> 02:57:25.640]  And I'll tell you what, they might do something with Hillary Clinton campaigning on a video screen.
[02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:27.701]  She never actually makes a physical appearance.
[02:57:28.102 --> 02:57:28.622]  Think about that.
[02:57:31.761 --> 02:57:35.562]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:57:35.902 --> 02:57:42.545]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[02:59:08.661 --> 02:59:10.743]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[02:59:11.083 --> 02:59:12.845]  Apple banned your app.
[02:59:13.145 --> 02:59:17.009]  I helped, too!
[02:59:17.289 --> 02:59:18.290]  Ah, Oliver.
[02:59:18.310 --> 02:59:21.973]  I hate free speech, too!
[02:59:22.013 --> 02:59:24.916]  We hate free speech!
[02:59:24.996 --> 02:59:26.817]  We hate free speech!
[02:59:26.877 --> 02:59:28.078]  We hate free speech!
[02:59:28.159 --> 02:59:29.840]  We hate free speech!
[02:59:36.138 --> 02:59:38.239]  Thank you for receiving this transmission.
[02:59:38.319 --> 02:59:39.760]  You are the resistance.
[02:59:59.315 --> 03:00:09.225]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got Roger Stone joining us here, but we have a hurricane in Florida that has just made landfall at Panama City Beach.
[03:00:09.265 --> 03:00:13.709]  The flooding is already disastrous, and Sean is calling in from Florida.
[03:00:13.749 --> 03:00:15.210]  He's just an hour inland.
[03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:19.535]  So I wanted to go to Sean here, just get an update of what the weather is like an hour inland.
[03:00:19.915 --> 03:00:21.617]  Sean, what's it looking like for Florida right now?
[03:00:22.907 --> 03:00:23.287]  Yes, sir.
[03:00:23.387 --> 03:00:27.591]  Owen, I'm actually in Milton, which is a small part of Pensacola.
[03:00:27.691 --> 03:00:32.554]  I'm about two and a half hours from Panama City, where it's made landfall, Michael.
[03:00:34.476 --> 03:00:36.938]  Looking out my window, you know, it's two and a half hours away.
[03:00:36.998 --> 03:00:39.480]  You really can't see a whole lot.
[03:00:39.520 --> 03:00:41.001]  You know, there's not trees blowing around.
[03:00:41.061 --> 03:00:41.441]  It's nothing.
[03:00:41.461 --> 03:00:45.845]  I mean, you wouldn't know that there's a hurricane two and a half hours away that's blowing 150 mile an hour.
[03:00:46.365 --> 03:00:47.566]  Put it that way, where I'm at.
[03:00:47.646 --> 03:00:50.848]  So I'm actually safe and got a lot of family.
[03:00:52.085 --> 03:00:53.426]  That's in this area.
[03:00:53.486 --> 03:00:54.307]  We're all safe.
[03:00:54.367 --> 03:01:02.274]  But anybody in the Panama City area, if you didn't evacuate, I sure hope you got your stuff together because it's nasty.
[03:01:02.314 --> 03:01:08.620]  And I don't feel like it got the attention that it needed here locally and how strong this storm was going to be.
[03:01:08.680 --> 03:01:10.001]  Well, yeah, that's what I was saying earlier.
[03:01:10.481 --> 03:01:13.384]  It becomes a news phenomenon more than anything.
[03:01:14.225 --> 03:01:19.029]  And because this wasn't a news phenomenon, it seemed like nobody really cared and it just sprung up on people.
[03:01:20.066 --> 03:01:20.526]  Exactly.
[03:01:20.947 --> 03:01:21.387]  Exactly.
[03:01:21.407 --> 03:01:22.347]  That's it.
[03:01:23.708 --> 03:01:24.649]  I'll give a quick shout-out.
[03:01:24.709 --> 03:01:26.570]  SpaghettiModels.com, Mike's weather page.
[03:01:26.610 --> 03:01:32.273]  He became very popular in the last several years, since 2004.
[03:01:32.313 --> 03:01:34.915]  He does his own, basically, website.
[03:01:34.935 --> 03:01:39.058]  He takes all the radars from all over the place and puts them on one page, really easy to see.
[03:01:40.558 --> 03:01:47.663]  He's been saying the same thing, that he doesn't know what the deal is with Pensacola, Gulf Breeze, our area, Escambia County,
[03:01:48.519 --> 03:01:53.802]  The furthest western part of the panhandle not giving the storm the coverage it needs.
[03:01:53.842 --> 03:01:54.162]  Period.
[03:01:55.523 --> 03:01:57.004]  It just didn't have the human interest.
[03:01:57.084 --> 03:01:58.365]  It just didn't have the ratings.
[03:01:58.465 --> 03:01:59.425]  Other stuff did, Sean.
[03:01:59.465 --> 03:02:00.606]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:02:01.146 --> 03:02:02.767]  And Roger Stone joins me.
[03:02:02.807 --> 03:02:08.430]  He's in South Florida, so the hurricane storm is going to miss him.
[03:02:08.971 --> 03:02:10.912]  But we bring Roger Stone in now.
[03:02:11.232 --> 03:02:12.312]  What do you think of that, Roger?
[03:02:12.372 --> 03:02:14.614]  Why the lack of media coverage on this deal?
[03:02:15.558 --> 03:02:35.535]  Well, there's so much going on, Owen, between the Kavanaugh struggle, the extraordinary comments of Hillary Clinton today, essentially starting a civil war in America, the startling revelations by the General Counsel of the FBI that Rod Rosenstein was entirely serious when he talked about
[03:02:36.215 --> 03:02:44.181]  Entrapping the President of the United States on a wire in order to take him down under the 25th Amendment is just a lot of breaking news.
[03:02:45.041 --> 03:02:57.510]  And I think with all of these national events, many people have not caught onto the fact that one of the most powerful hurricanes in history is about to hit the northern portion of Florida.
[03:02:58.431 --> 03:03:01.333]  This, of course, is the District of Congressman Matt Gaetz.
[03:03:01.874 --> 03:03:13.503]  I know that Gaetz is very closely monitoring the situation, that he is in constant communications with all of the federal agencies involved to ensure that there are no delays in getting people help they may need.
[03:03:14.103 --> 03:03:15.504]  Backstopping the President.
[03:03:15.584 --> 03:03:21.089]  I know the President and Governor Rick Scott are very focused on this coming emergency.
[03:03:21.809 --> 03:03:24.171]  And Floridians are somewhat used to this.
[03:03:24.571 --> 03:03:26.113]  We're a hearty lot down here.
[03:03:26.953 --> 03:03:39.076]  I can say that we're not expected to feel the results here in South Florida, other than some winds and a stiff rain, but our prayers and our best hopes go out to our friends and fellow Floridians to the North.
[03:03:40.777 --> 03:03:43.277]  What do you make of Hillary Clinton's comments, Roger?
[03:03:43.977 --> 03:03:53.200]  You know, I think that she's such a desperate woman, she hopes that she can start a civil war, maybe to distract from all the crimes that she may be convicted of in the near future?
[03:03:54.363 --> 03:03:56.526]  Well, I can sum this up really in one big word.
[03:03:57.106 --> 03:03:57.547]  Greed.
[03:03:58.588 --> 03:04:00.651]  The Clintons are epically greedy.
[03:04:00.771 --> 03:04:11.965]  Not only is Hillary a short-tempered, foul-mouthed, self-centered kleptocrat, but she has still not gotten over her defeat at the improbable 2016 election.
[03:04:13.847 --> 03:04:22.190]  And she hopes to try to re-engineer this, foment the impeachment of our president, and perhaps take another shot at the Oval Office.
[03:04:22.230 --> 03:04:28.351]  We're going to cover this in great length on the other side, Owen, when we continue the Alex Jones Show.
[03:04:29.192 --> 03:04:31.833]  But I really think this is about the money.
[03:04:32.473 --> 03:04:36.214]  The real question is, with these criminals, how much is enough?
[03:04:44.153 --> 03:04:47.174]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force.
[03:04:47.234 --> 03:04:47.714]  Go ahead.
[03:04:47.954 --> 03:04:53.535]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[03:04:53.735 --> 03:04:54.815]  I'd done the War Room.
[03:04:55.135 --> 03:04:57.595]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[03:04:57.615 --> 03:04:59.156]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[03:04:59.196 --> 03:04:59.816]  I was exhausted.
[03:05:00.136 --> 03:05:03.417]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[03:05:03.757 --> 03:05:08.397]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[03:05:08.477 --> 03:05:10.518]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[03:05:10.558 --> 03:05:11.318]  The same thing.
[03:05:11.698 --> 03:05:12.539]  We're good to go.
[03:05:45.741 --> 03:06:03.734]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.195 --> 03:06:07.097]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:06:09.133 --> 03:06:09.854]  Welcome back.
[03:06:10.414 --> 03:06:17.441]  I'm Roger Stone, taking the baton from my colleague Owen Schroer, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:18.772 --> 03:06:26.455]  In the 40 years in which I've been involved in American politics, I have never seen anyone quite so tone-deaf as Hillary Clinton.
[03:06:27.295 --> 03:06:31.397]  She entered the 2016 campaign as a heavy favorite.
[03:06:32.377 --> 03:06:36.639]  She outraised and outmaneuvered her opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders.
[03:06:37.419 --> 03:06:45.042]  We now know, thanks to the WikiLeaks disclosures, that she had to cheat Senator Sanders in order to win the Democratic nomination.
[03:06:45.802 --> 03:06:53.224]  That's an extraordinary piece of information in view of the fact that Senator Sanders wasn't even a registered Democrat when his campaign began.
[03:06:54.364 --> 03:07:04.187]  Then she overcompensated and was enormously overconfident in what she thought would be an easy election against Donald Trump.
[03:07:04.968 --> 03:07:12.890]  She was drubbed in at least three debates and then still counting on victory she made the
[03:07:13.630 --> 03:07:20.976]  Misstep of denouncing the president's supporters as deplorables, an enormous self-inflicted wound.
[03:07:21.717 --> 03:07:26.441]  But now, improbably, she just doesn't know when to get off the stage.
[03:07:27.242 --> 03:07:38.551]  You see, in the 1980s, when we had a monolithic media, three networks, two fledging cable news networks, it was much easier to stifle the real news.
[03:07:39.272 --> 03:07:45.074]  Women like Juanita Broderick could be muzzled, and their story would never be widely told.
[03:07:45.955 --> 03:07:53.477]  But by 2016, we had a robust, vibrant alternative media, of which InfoWars was the flagship.
[03:07:54.078 --> 03:08:02.821]  And therefore, the truth about Hillary Clinton's abuse of Bill Clinton's sexual assault victims became common knowledge.
[03:08:03.681 --> 03:08:24.335]  My book, The Clinton's War on Women, which is available right now at the Infowars.com store, is the definitive opposition research dump on the criminal career of Bill and Hillary Clinton and their greedy little daughter, or I should say, her greedy little daughter, Chelsea.
[03:08:25.175 --> 03:08:32.740]  Then, even my mind was blown by this interview by Hillary that hit the waves this morning.
[03:08:32.801 --> 03:08:33.461]  Let's roll that.
[03:08:34.802 --> 03:08:42.526]  You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.
[03:08:43.027 --> 03:08:51.331]  That's why I believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the House and or the Senate, that's when civility can start again.
[03:08:51.772 --> 03:08:58.756]  But until then, the only thing that the Republicans seem to recognize and respect is strength.
[03:09:00.609 --> 03:09:01.790]  Well, there you have it.
[03:09:01.990 --> 03:09:04.292]  It is a license for violence.
[03:09:04.553 --> 03:09:07.015]  It's a declaration of war.
[03:09:07.615 --> 03:09:11.979]  It's one of the most irresponsible things I've ever seen anyone in politics do.
[03:09:12.640 --> 03:09:16.303]  But perhaps Hillary is just warming up for her coming tour.
[03:09:16.724 --> 03:09:17.284]  That's right.
[03:09:17.504 --> 03:09:22.609]  The Clintons, Bill and Hillary, are going on tour with tickets going for as much as $700 apiece.
[03:09:25.171 --> 03:09:27.752]  It's amazing that these people hope to cash in.
[03:09:28.312 --> 03:09:30.872]  Let's take a look at that actual schedule.
[03:09:31.532 --> 03:09:36.253]  The date that comes to the most interest for me is October 23rd.
[03:09:37.133 --> 03:09:41.694]  October 23rd, we will be having the rally for civility.
[03:09:42.074 --> 03:09:45.875]  The rally against Hillary on the very day that she comes to Florida.
[03:09:46.315 --> 03:09:50.416]  That's at Gallupi's restaurant right here in Pompano Beach, October 23rd.
[03:09:51.536 --> 03:09:54.358]  You can go to eventbrite.com for tickets.
[03:09:54.899 --> 03:09:56.820]  I will be headlining that rally.
[03:09:57.361 --> 03:10:08.789]  On the other end of the state, Hillary Clinton will be in town to help sink the Democratic ticket of Andrew Gillum for governor and the comatose Bill Nelson for the U.S.
[03:10:08.949 --> 03:10:09.270]  Senate.
[03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:25.819]  I can understand why the Gillum and Nelson forces would want Barack Obama to visit Florida, but Hillary Clinton's visiting this state where, based on every poll, she's underwater with a net unfavorable really begs the question.
[03:10:26.600 --> 03:10:31.863]  But if you look at the actual schedule, this today is a call to action.
[03:10:32.643 --> 03:10:38.545]  I think it is incumbent on patriots to come out and greet Bill and Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:39.025 --> 03:10:52.890]  Notice that she will be on November 18th in Las Vegas, Nevada, on December 4th in Sugar Land, Texas, on April 11th at the Beacon Theater in New York City, on April 12th at the Fox
[03:10:53.590 --> 03:11:12.216]  Theater in Detroit, on April 13th in Philadelphia, on April 26th in Wallingford, Connecticut, my native state, on April 27th in Washington, D.C., on April 30th, Boston, Massachusetts, and so on.
[03:11:12.296 --> 03:11:14.297]  May 3rd, Seattle, Washington.
[03:11:14.677 --> 03:11:16.598]  May 4th, Inglewood, California.
[03:11:17.518 --> 03:11:26.900]  You can go to the Infowars.com store now, where we are backordered on our epic, iconic, Clinton rape t-shirts.
[03:11:27.460 --> 03:11:32.921]  We're going to struggle to get the iconic Bill Clinton rape whistles back in circulation.
[03:11:33.061 --> 03:11:35.822]  We sold out of them, folks, in November of 2016.
[03:11:36.142 --> 03:11:45.664]  You're going to need both of these for your peaceful, entirely peaceful protest of the Clintons raping of the political system.
[03:11:46.905 --> 03:11:52.191]  $700 to listen to Hillary Clinton make excuses about why she lost the election?
[03:11:52.632 --> 03:11:54.094]  She's blamed Bernie Sanders.
[03:11:54.534 --> 03:11:56.256]  She's blamed the Democratic Party.
[03:11:56.677 --> 03:12:00.121]  She's blamed men who told their wives how to vote.
[03:12:00.542 --> 03:12:02.945]  She's blamed everyone but the obvious victim.
[03:12:03.405 --> 03:12:05.846]  That would be Hillary Clinton herself.
[03:12:06.366 --> 03:12:10.408]  You see, they thought they could hide their lurid past.
[03:12:10.928 --> 03:12:27.216]  But with Infowars as the flagship, and a robust alternative conservative media, the Breitbarts, the Daily Callers, the Gateway Pundit, Town Hall, and so on, it's impossible to suppress the truth.
[03:12:28.296 --> 03:12:31.458]  And the Clintons, I think, have made yet another step.
[03:12:32.558 --> 03:12:39.724]  Many people ask me, as I go out on the speaking stump, whether Hillary is going to run again in 2020.
[03:12:41.325 --> 03:12:41.645]  Run?
[03:12:42.046 --> 03:12:43.527]  The woman can barely walk.
[03:12:44.608 --> 03:13:01.061]  When she collapsed in 70 degree heat in New York City, it was shortly after she put out a press release accusing Alex Jones and Roger Stone of making up lies about her health.
[03:13:01.874 --> 03:13:17.358]  This doesn't explain why her head snapped around like a demon, why she has multiple coughing fits, why even Bill Clinton admitted in a CBS interview, later edited, that she collapses constantly.
[03:13:18.098 --> 03:13:23.199]  I don't think she has the physical fortitude or the stamina for another presidential campaign.
[03:13:24.039 --> 03:13:25.020]  But we can hope.
[03:13:25.701 --> 03:13:34.068]  To win the Democratic nomination, she'll have to steal it again, because the Democrats recognize that Clinton's days are over.
[03:13:34.768 --> 03:13:41.614]  But she may be able to command enough money and enough allegiance among the fanatics to be nominated yet again.
[03:13:42.475 --> 03:13:43.815]  We can only hope.
[03:13:44.496 --> 03:13:50.678]  If Hillary Clinton is the nominee of the Democratic Party, Donald Trump will beat her like a drum.
[03:13:51.358 --> 03:14:10.284]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and I do need to point out to you yet again that the precursor for an attempt to remove our president, the precursor for a Hillary Clinton candidacy, a revenge candidacy, is the silencing of InfoWars.
[03:14:11.024 --> 03:14:12.605]  There's no question about it, folks.
[03:14:12.685 --> 03:14:28.177]  Number one in the Globalist's game plan is to shut Alex Jones and Owen Schroyer and David Knight and Roger Stone and Rob Doo and Millie Weaver and so many others who bring you the tough investigative reporting here at InfoWars down.
[03:14:28.658 --> 03:14:30.319]  You see, they need to silence us.
[03:14:30.419 --> 03:14:32.521]  That's why we need your support right now.
[03:14:33.001 --> 03:14:35.103]  Please go to the InfoWars.com store.
[03:14:35.803 --> 03:14:45.757]  If you are not in the market for one of our great nutraceuticals, if you're not looking for a book or a t-shirt or any other of our great products, well then you can still help the war for freedom.
[03:14:46.157 --> 03:14:47.339]  Go to the donate button.
[03:14:47.399 --> 03:14:48.480]  We'll show you where it is.
[03:14:48.841 --> 03:14:50.423]  And send your contribution today!
[03:14:51.164 --> 03:14:51.284]  For $100, $75, $50, $25.
[03:14:51.484 --> 03:14:59.385]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000.
[03:15:01.306 --> 03:15:06.147]  They know when you contribute to InfoWars, it doesn't go in Alex Jones' pocket.
[03:15:06.507 --> 03:15:20.049]  It goes right back into the InfoWars network to expand our new studios, to hire new people, and to fight the outrageous harassment lawsuits that are meant to smear us as a provocation for removing us from social media.
[03:15:20.729 --> 03:15:24.654]  I'm Roger Stone, we're on the Alex Jones Show, and we're just getting started.
[03:15:27.537 --> 03:15:31.641]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:15:31.661 --> 03:15:33.103]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:15:45.746 --> 03:15:55.552]  Imagine a Hollywood movie where a guy 12 years ago is running a tanning salon in a little town in England and sees 10, 12, 13-year-old girls crying for mommy being put in cars.
[03:15:55.592 --> 03:15:58.814]  And then he talks to the fathers and mothers and they go, yeah, the police won't help us.
[03:15:59.355 --> 03:16:00.916]  Our daughters are sold to sex slavery.
[03:16:01.876 --> 03:16:14.401]  And then it comes out nine, ten years after he talks about it, it's happening in every town, and in many areas the police are involved, and the government, and then the Asian men organizing, the Muslim men organizing the girls for sex.
[03:16:14.441 --> 03:16:17.202]  You got the white guys coming in, others having sex with them.
[03:16:17.362 --> 03:16:19.483]  This is the known pedophilia of the UK.
[03:16:19.603 --> 03:16:21.184]  It's the religion of the elite over there.
[03:16:21.324 --> 03:16:25.926]  And so they tried to mentally destroy him, and Tommy, just wherever you want to take this interview, you're in control now.
[03:16:26.346 --> 03:16:27.967]  So basically, the
[03:16:28.769 --> 03:16:32.671]  These gangs were operating freely for 30 years.
[03:16:33.631 --> 03:16:43.496]  And our country witnessed the conspiracy of silence from police leaders, community leaders, religious leaders, to facilitate this rape.
[03:16:43.696 --> 03:16:54.541]  And what's come out in the reports is the reason, the reason why the police didn't act, the reason why social services, the organisations put in to protect children, the reason why they allowed.
[03:16:54.961 --> 03:16:56.742]  They actually allowed, when you read the reports.
[03:16:57.322 --> 03:17:11.090]  They allowed gangs of men, Muslim men, to come and pick the children up from care homes, sit outside in their car picking 12-year-old children up, take them away for three or four days and drop them back in a dishevelled state.
[03:17:11.270 --> 03:17:14.572]  And no one fought justice or no one fought to do something.
[03:17:14.792 --> 03:17:22.496]  Anyone in a position of power who tried to whistleblow and identify these problems was quickly sidelined, fired and targeted.
[03:17:22.716 --> 03:17:25.398]  So the level of rape
[03:17:26.104 --> 03:17:31.266]  The level of abuse, this isn't just sexual gratification for the men doing it.
[03:17:31.846 --> 03:17:38.048]  They are literally doing everything they can to destroy the victim, to torture the victim.
[03:17:38.188 --> 03:17:46.632]  They are, and this has gone on, I think there's in every single town, city in the UK that has an Islamic community, there are these rapist ones.
[03:17:47.032 --> 03:17:52.494]  And the word used in Britain is grooming, which sounds like something cute, doesn't it?
[03:17:52.574 --> 03:17:52.974]  Grooming.
[03:17:53.474 --> 03:17:54.555]  Well, you're grooming your dog.
[03:17:54.935 --> 03:17:58.196]  This is actually a rape jihad by an invading army.
[03:17:58.376 --> 03:18:03.159]  Now, what these men do to some of these victims, if I just talk to you about some of the cities.
[03:18:03.419 --> 03:18:16.945]  In one of the cities in the north of England, they took a young 12-year-old girl and they stuck a claw... When they got her pregnant through repeated rapes, they took her to a field and they put a claw hammer up inside her to give her an abortion.
[03:18:18.018 --> 03:18:22.961]  They have taken young girls and put their tongues on tables and put nails through them.
[03:18:23.541 --> 03:18:35.148]  They have branded young 11-year-old children where they've heated up iron rods with the letter M and they've scalded it on their bum because that 11-year-old girl was the property of Mohammed.
[03:18:35.829 --> 03:18:45.835]  Now, during all of this, families whose children have become victims have gone to the police, they've gone to the authorities, they've cried and they've begged for help.
[03:18:46.667 --> 03:18:48.388]  Rather than getting help.
[03:18:48.428 --> 03:18:59.953]  These stories, when you read them, finally, when we first started talking about this a decade ago, we were branded as extremists and racists and people simply did not want to believe it.
[03:19:00.753 --> 03:19:06.996]  Now we have government reports and government investigations that show and expose the truth in all of this.
[03:19:07.676 --> 03:19:09.557]  We've had young fathers.
[03:19:10.837 --> 03:19:15.119]  Two of their daughters are in a house with a dozen Muslim men.
[03:19:16.218 --> 03:19:18.499]  Their daughters are 12 and 13 years old.
[03:19:19.060 --> 03:19:22.701]  The fathers have got to get up and they've got to get their girls back.
[03:19:23.542 --> 03:19:24.682]  The police have turned up.
[03:19:25.523 --> 03:19:26.543]  They arrested the dads.
[03:19:27.524 --> 03:19:28.484]  They leave the girls.
[03:19:28.664 --> 03:19:29.645]  This isn't Netflix.
[03:19:29.965 --> 03:19:30.665]  It isn't movies.
[03:19:30.725 --> 03:19:31.626]  This is a real hero.
[03:19:31.886 --> 03:19:33.047]  This is a guy they've tried to kill.
[03:19:33.087 --> 03:19:34.607]  This is a guy tortured in prison repeatedly.
[03:19:34.828 --> 03:19:35.928]  This is a guy that lost his house.
[03:19:36.148 --> 03:19:37.589]  His wife and children facing ass attack.
[03:19:37.909 --> 03:19:39.330]  This is a real man right here.
[03:19:45.385 --> 03:19:56.497]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:58.099 --> 03:20:02.063]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:20:02.243 --> 03:20:04.645]  You're listening to Roger Stone on N4.
[03:20:10.219 --> 03:20:11.740]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[03:20:11.960 --> 03:20:16.124]  I'm Roger Stone, back in the saddle at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.044 --> 03:20:29.955]  Some of you may remember that an Obama-backed group called the Project for Democracy sued me and others in Washington, D.C., claiming, stop me if you've heard this,
[03:20:30.655 --> 03:20:47.562]  The Russians hacked the DNC, gave the allegedly hacked emails to WikiLeaks, WikiLeaks gave them to Julian Assange, Julian Assange gave them to Roger Stone, and Roger Stone gave them to Donald Trump, or the Trump campaign.
[03:20:48.573 --> 03:20:49.053]  Fiction.
[03:20:49.073 --> 03:20:50.734]  A fairy tale.
[03:20:51.475 --> 03:20:54.797]  A claim for which there is no evidence whatsoever.
[03:20:55.317 --> 03:21:00.481]  Not in the hands of Robert Mueller, not in the hands of the lawyers for the DNC.
[03:21:01.321 --> 03:21:13.429]  When pressed in that lawsuit for evidence, they turned over fake news clippings from the Huffington Post and other fake news outlets as if that sufficed as evidence.
[03:21:14.069 --> 03:21:16.371]  Well, that lawsuit was dismissed.
[03:21:17.131 --> 03:21:27.859]  Now, Project Democracy has refiled that suit on behalf of three DNC employees in Richmond, Virginia, a different venue.
[03:21:28.720 --> 03:21:31.622]  And The Atlantic has now reported
[03:21:32.382 --> 03:21:41.105]  That the Trump campaign has responded in those legal proceedings by saying that exploiting hacked emails is free speech.
[03:21:41.765 --> 03:21:48.447]  What they don't tell you is that the Project Democracy dropped Roger Stone from that lawsuit.
[03:21:48.927 --> 03:21:52.228]  That I am not a defendant in the new suit.
[03:21:53.008 --> 03:22:00.230]  And the exploiting of published material that's already online is certainly within the public domain.
[03:22:01.050 --> 03:22:02.251]  Here is my prediction.
[03:22:02.992 --> 03:22:07.775]  The three employees of the DNC will lose again.
[03:22:08.756 --> 03:22:28.592]  Now, in other legal matters, the Democratic National Committee is proceeding with their lawsuit, this one filed in New York City, against me, against the Trump campaign, against the Republican National Committee, against the Russian state,
[03:22:29.312 --> 03:22:32.636]  Against Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law.
[03:22:33.176 --> 03:22:36.600]  Against Donald Trump Jr., the President's son.
[03:22:37.200 --> 03:22:39.523]  Against the Republican National Committee.
[03:22:40.243 --> 03:22:42.305]  Against the GRU.
[03:22:42.846 --> 03:22:44.568]  Against Vladimir Putin.
[03:22:45.268 --> 03:22:48.392]  Against Julian Assange.
[03:22:48.772 --> 03:22:49.973]  Against WikiLeaks.
[03:22:50.814 --> 03:22:53.696]  I don't know, I think they threw Bozo the Clown in there as well.
[03:22:54.296 --> 03:23:19.554]  This is another baseless lawsuit, but strangely enough, of all those defendants, only the lawyers that represent me, the same incredibly effective lawyers who won dismissal of the Project Democracy suit, Grant Smith and Rob Buchel, have the brains to ask for discovery and inspection of the DNC computer servers.
[03:23:20.825 --> 03:23:33.155]  This, of course, will lead to answering the $64 million question about whether the DNC was ever hacked by the Russians or anyone else.
[03:23:34.155 --> 03:23:40.880]  Although Chris Cuomo seemed rather incredulous when I said this on his show, the forensic evidence
[03:23:41.661 --> 03:23:48.148]  Published in the New Republic, it tends to indicate the exact opposite.
[03:23:48.188 --> 03:23:59.160]  In fact, there is more forensic evidence that would indicate that the purloined material from the DNC was downloaded to some type of portable drive
[03:23:59.801 --> 03:24:09.828]  And spirited out the back door by, the name we're not allowed to say, Seth Rich, a man whose murder continues to be unsolved.
[03:24:10.308 --> 03:24:20.836]  For those who say, oh, he was murdered in the course of a routine robbery, explain why his money, his wallet, and his jewelry were all intact.
[03:24:21.616 --> 03:24:27.262]  No, this was a political assassination by parties unknown.
[03:24:28.043 --> 03:24:35.570]  You see, they don't want an inspection of those servers because it will finally reveal whether they were hacked or not.
[03:24:36.311 --> 03:24:43.198]  In fact, don't be shocked to learn, when we get to this turn in the legal proceedings,
[03:24:44.232 --> 03:24:46.573]  That the servers no longer exist.
[03:24:47.073 --> 03:24:48.713]  That they've been bleached.
[03:24:49.274 --> 03:24:52.975]  Kind of like Hillary Clinton's email server was bleached.
[03:24:53.535 --> 03:24:55.336]  She even joked about it.
[03:24:55.956 --> 03:25:05.239]  This is the same evil witch who joked about hitting Julian Assange with a drone strike in order to kill him.
[03:25:05.879 --> 03:25:07.741]  Except for it wasn't a joke.
[03:25:08.442 --> 03:25:24.760]  The reason that Assange, who is nothing but a crusading journalist, who operates in the great American tradition of journalism, finding information that is of public value, certifying its accuracy and authenticity, and publishing it.
[03:25:25.661 --> 03:25:29.786]  Like the Washington Post and the Pentagon Papers, for example.
[03:25:30.466 --> 03:25:37.574]  But some in the media and on the left have sought to criminalize the activities of Assange and WikiLeaks.
[03:25:38.434 --> 03:25:44.180]  I'm not sure what his crime would be, yet they speak of extraditing him to the United States.
[03:25:44.881 --> 03:25:47.944]  Would somebody please straighten Jeff Sessions out about this?
[03:25:48.044 --> 03:25:50.005]  Well, first you better wake him up.
[03:25:50.506 --> 03:25:52.087]  Then you can straighten him out.
[03:25:52.568 --> 03:25:58.893]  If he goes into an immediate tirade about arresting people for using medicinal marijuana, don't be shocked.
[03:25:59.393 --> 03:26:10.923]  If he tries to talk to you about asset forfeiture before you've been convicted of any crime, well, that's our Jeff Sessions, the comatose Attorney General of the United States.
[03:26:11.844 --> 03:26:20.886]  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, a giant controversy growing over the avoidance of testimony by Rod Rosenstein.
[03:26:21.266 --> 03:26:22.206]  You remember him.
[03:26:22.326 --> 03:26:38.089]  He's the guy that the New York Times reported only days ago was supposedly proposed wearing a wire in order to entrap the President of the United States in order to remove him under the 25th Amendment.
[03:26:40.144 --> 03:26:48.691]  According to the New York Times, multiple sources confirmed that Rosenstein was not kidding, and that he was deadly serious.
[03:26:48.751 --> 03:26:53.035]  But that didn't stop NBC from reporting that it was all a joke.
[03:26:53.575 --> 03:26:55.176]  But it wasn't a joke.
[03:26:55.757 --> 03:27:07.666]  Then, shrewder heads like Mark Levin, Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson, and others suggested that perhaps the president should not fire Mr. Rosenstein.
[03:27:08.829 --> 03:27:10.690]  Ahead of the coming election.
[03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:14.011]  In retrospect, I have to agree with that.
[03:27:14.591 --> 03:27:33.757]  But the question of Mr. Rosenstein's conflicts of interest, his prior relationship with Robert Mueller and James Comey, and the fact that the recommendation to the president that Comey be fired is one of the matters under investigation by Mueller himself,
[03:27:34.753 --> 03:27:34.933]  I think?
[03:27:54.438 --> 03:28:00.742]  In the meantime, every poll I have seen points to a resurgent Republican Party.
[03:28:01.182 --> 03:28:10.828]  And in the wake of the character assassination lynching of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, Republicans are awake and energized.
[03:28:11.469 --> 03:28:21.615]  Talk by Congressman Jerry Nadler and Senator Hirono about impeaching Kavanaugh just eggs our people on and torques up our intensity.
[03:28:22.055 --> 03:28:23.116]  I'll be right back.
[03:28:43.232 --> 03:28:43.441]  Yeah.
[03:28:45.243 --> 03:28:46.824]  Your season has come to an end.
[03:28:46.844 --> 03:28:48.145]  A new season is here.
[03:28:48.305 --> 03:28:51.107]  Because we know humanity faces big challenges soon.
[03:28:51.147 --> 03:28:52.287]  We have to get ready for those.
[03:28:52.487 --> 03:28:53.848]  We have to get ready to make the jump.
[03:28:53.908 --> 03:28:56.570]  The time for this solar system is coming to an end.
[03:28:56.790 --> 03:28:57.751]  Everything counts down.
[03:28:57.951 --> 03:28:58.891]  Everything's been laid out.
[03:28:58.971 --> 03:29:00.852]  We've got maybe a hundred years to make the jump.
[03:29:00.912 --> 03:29:08.437]  The evil resonates with these low-level people to try to freeze us here, and then keep us here, delay us here.
[03:29:08.457 --> 03:29:09.117]  It's not happening.
[03:29:09.598 --> 03:29:11.038]  You will not stop the progress.
[03:29:11.679 --> 03:29:13.000]  Our ancestors, in their
[03:29:13.820 --> 03:29:14.180]  Purity.
[03:29:14.440 --> 03:29:22.262]  And by purity, I mean not pious purity, but genetic purity in the raw, primordial system they came from.
[03:29:22.782 --> 03:29:28.244]  Their will has a dimensional weight that punches through anything these statements do.
[03:29:28.704 --> 03:29:29.884]  We just have to call upon it.
[03:29:30.325 --> 03:29:34.406]  And to these fallen individuals, the will of humanity is a very frightening thing.
[03:29:34.726 --> 03:29:36.246]  It is frightening.
[03:29:36.686 --> 03:29:37.546]  It's the fear of God.
[03:29:37.767 --> 03:29:39.147]  God fashioned us.
[03:29:39.807 --> 03:29:40.767]  Made us in his image.
[03:29:41.147 --> 03:29:42.968]  Knew us before we were in our mother's womb.
[03:29:45.262 --> 03:29:48.863]  God created these enemies to test his people.
[03:29:49.343 --> 03:29:53.764]  Once you step past them, all of eternity is before you, and it's all a giant loop.
[03:29:53.984 --> 03:29:56.344]  You're like the past, the present, the future, all of it.
[03:29:56.384 --> 03:29:58.165]  You're like, it's not just the past, the present, the future.
[03:29:58.205 --> 03:30:00.045]  That's only one spectrum, third dimension.
[03:30:00.085 --> 03:30:04.786]  Then you can delve as deep as you want to go, and you're like, does Satanist want to serve this?
[03:30:04.966 --> 03:30:07.687]  Why the secrets of Satanism take 30 seconds to know.
[03:30:07.947 --> 03:30:15.132]  To even look into the heights of higher dimensions in God is Valhalla to the next level.
[03:30:15.392 --> 03:30:17.293]  And then you wonder, how could they do this?
[03:30:17.613 --> 03:30:20.675]  Because they were given power in this dimension.
[03:30:20.835 --> 03:30:24.378]  And that's what this is, a cosmic con game coming to an end.
[03:30:24.638 --> 03:30:28.380]  And it doesn't mean some utopia comes after this.
[03:30:28.420 --> 03:30:29.481]  That is not what's going to happen.
[03:30:30.121 --> 03:30:31.822]  It's simply the next level.
[03:30:32.183 --> 03:30:35.465]  We'll laugh together when we are at the next level together.
[03:30:36.781 --> 03:30:38.102]  We were worried about that!
[03:30:38.362 --> 03:30:39.303]  Look at that!
[03:30:39.363 --> 03:30:40.784]  Because nothing is given.
[03:30:41.205 --> 03:30:42.426]  Everything has to be achieved.
[03:30:42.506 --> 03:30:44.127]  Although that sounds fantastical.
[03:30:44.527 --> 03:30:45.988]  Have you looked where you are?
[03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:47.530]  You're at the weigh station.
[03:30:48.370 --> 03:30:50.872]  You're at the lily pad, the big pond.
[03:30:51.112 --> 03:30:53.675]  And out beyond is the mountains and the sky.
[03:30:54.335 --> 03:30:55.256]  The universe.
[03:30:55.316 --> 03:30:57.277]  It's endless, the potential God's given you.
[03:30:57.618 --> 03:30:58.739]  But it's free will.
[03:30:58.879 --> 03:31:02.181]  But it's very freeing once you have stared over the misty mountains.
[03:31:03.022 --> 03:31:03.903]  Once you have seen
[03:31:04.783 --> 03:31:07.845]  The potential, and no, there's really good in the universe, not just evil.
[03:31:08.245 --> 03:31:15.368]  It's a great comfort to know no matter what happens to these little frail bodies, these ugly things, that there's a bigger plan.
[03:31:15.708 --> 03:31:22.612]  Once you get it, you're like, oh my god, this demon thing is telling me how corrupt I am, because I have a conscience, and I know I'm not perfect, so I'm listening.
[03:31:22.672 --> 03:31:23.372]  Oh yeah, I want to do better.
[03:31:23.412 --> 03:31:23.712]  You're right.
[03:31:24.072 --> 03:31:24.753]  But it's a lie.
[03:31:25.473 --> 03:31:34.719]  And once you don't listen to the devil, the accuser, always accusing you, always telling you how you're bad, always telling you how you're failed, always telling you how you're ugly, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, you're nothing, because it knows you've got a soul.
[03:31:35.059 --> 03:31:36.460]  It knows you've got that pain.
[03:31:36.540 --> 03:31:37.801]  It can, it can hack that.
[03:31:37.861 --> 03:31:40.242]  It can send, it doesn't have that, but it knows you've got it.
[03:31:40.282 --> 03:31:48.327]  So it just keeps telling you how you're a Nazi and how you're this and how you're that and how you're falling and how you're, so you kind of get off balance and give it your power when the minute
[03:31:49.580 --> 03:31:54.567]  You go, I'm not perfect, but I love God, and I want justice, and I want a future, and I want whatever the next level is.
[03:31:54.607 --> 03:31:55.488]  My God, I can feel it.
[03:31:55.708 --> 03:31:56.610]  Whatever it is, it's good.
[03:31:56.650 --> 03:31:58.011]  I wanna go up, not down.
[03:31:58.392 --> 03:32:00.355]  You're free.
[03:32:00.375 --> 03:32:00.715]  Tough, huh?
[03:32:04.580 --> 03:32:05.742]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up here.
[03:32:11.648 --> 03:32:18.071]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[03:32:18.151 --> 03:32:24.954]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[03:32:24.975 --> 03:32:40.502]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[03:32:46.474 --> 03:32:56.762]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:32:56.822 --> 03:33:02.125]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Roger Stone.
[03:33:02.466 --> 03:33:05.308]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.624 --> 03:33:12.767]  That is the master of the Stratocaster, yes indeed, B.B.
[03:33:12.847 --> 03:33:16.730]  King, perhaps the greatest guitarist of all time, bringing us in.
[03:33:17.651 --> 03:33:28.840]  So, Rod Rosenstein, the de facto Attorney General of the United States, was scheduled to testify this week before the House Judiciary Committee.
[03:33:29.581 --> 03:33:34.584]  We have just learned from CNN that that testimony has been postponed.
[03:33:35.385 --> 03:33:40.626]  Reading Mr. Rosenstein's testimony back in December, it's not surprising.
[03:33:41.326 --> 03:33:45.787]  He's got a lot of splainin' to do, and he doesn't want to do it under oath.
[03:33:46.168 --> 03:33:48.528]  Certainly not before the election.
[03:33:49.448 --> 03:33:55.990]  Congressman Matt Gaetz, a great friend of mine, has quoted as saying that
[03:33:56.750 --> 03:34:03.615]  He had returned to Washington from Florida in preparation for this hearing.
[03:34:03.635 --> 03:34:15.965]  He is, of course, on high alert regarding the hurricane that is about to hit his district, and he wants to be in a position to ensure immediate federal assistance should it be needed.
[03:34:17.226 --> 03:34:23.431]  But when he learned that the hearing had been postponed, he said, and I quote,
[03:34:24.031 --> 03:34:30.535]  Chairman Goodlatte has been playing hide-and-seek with some of us on the interview scheduling for several weeks.
[03:34:31.316 --> 03:34:48.367]  You'd think after the FBI top lawyer said the current Deputy Attorney General was serious about overthrowing the President that we might issue a subpoena, hold a hearing, conduct oversight, actually do our job.
[03:34:49.227 --> 03:34:52.109]  That would be a refreshing change for Congress.
[03:34:53.070 --> 03:34:56.352]  I understand the frustration of Congressman Gates.
[03:34:56.412 --> 03:34:58.174]  He's absolutely right.
[03:34:58.834 --> 03:35:16.807]  The President, meantime, treated Mr. Rosenstein to a ride on Air Force One, announcing that he didn't really know Rod Previous very well, but they got along quite well, and he had no plans to fire him.
[03:35:17.839 --> 03:35:20.740]  For now, we shall see.
[03:35:21.600 --> 03:35:33.262]  As a 40-year student of American politics, Mr. Rosenstein is, without any question, the worst rat since, oh, I don't know, John Dean.
[03:35:34.282 --> 03:35:45.784]  The fact that he has played keep-away and sought to prevent the Congress, a co-equal branch of government, from having full access to the information pertaining
[03:35:46.264 --> 03:35:55.134]  to the FISA warrants that were used to illegally and unconstitutionally spy on Donald Trump's campaign.
[03:35:55.935 --> 03:36:03.363]  A crime that makes Watergate pale in comparison tells you where he is in this criminal conspiracy.
[03:36:04.404 --> 03:36:23.911]  The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was upset, depressed, angry, furious when the President made his memo advising the President on how and why FBI Director James Comey should be terminated public.
[03:36:24.651 --> 03:36:34.114]  You see, Rosenstein thought he could knife his buddy Comey in the back and nobody would know that he could play both sides, but he was exposed.
[03:36:34.834 --> 03:36:39.355]  So his make good was the appointment of Robert Mueller.
[03:36:39.935 --> 03:36:48.258]  Now, Mr. Mueller's authority has been questioned before the courts, but not properly, in my opinion.
[03:36:49.238 --> 03:36:56.604]  You see, the special counsel law that used to be on the books has expired.
[03:36:57.465 --> 03:37:11.056]  And therefore, my longtime associate and wingman, Andrew Miller, has been fighting a subpoena from Mr. Mueller, a blatant violation of his constitutional Fourth Amendment rights.
[03:37:11.997 --> 03:37:32.066]  As Mr. Miller made clear in an incredibly lucid radio interview with Michael Caputo on WBEN in Buffalo yesterday, reported by CNN, Mr. Miller has no evidence or knowledge of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration
[03:37:32.626 --> 03:37:35.830]  Or any other illegal act on my behalf.
[03:37:36.330 --> 03:37:46.641]  He points out that I was taunting and punking and posturing on my Twitter feed in order to taunt the Democrats and, yes, to sell books.
[03:37:47.521 --> 03:37:55.029]  Yet Mr. Mueller has sought to subpoena Mr. Miller and drag him before a grand jury in Washington, D.C.
[03:37:56.411 --> 03:38:00.714]  Miller points out that that puts an onus of expense and time on him.
[03:38:01.515 --> 03:38:11.622]  The claim by CNN that the special counsel's office reimburses witnesses who must come to Washington is misleading, fake news.
[03:38:12.082 --> 03:38:14.964]  They reimburse a small portion of your expense.
[03:38:15.905 --> 03:38:37.300]  Ask Kristin Davis, my longtime friend, who the special counsel slapped with the cost of a lawyer, travel, and child care for her trip to Washington, D.C., in which she told the grand jury that she also had no evidence of Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or any other misdeed on my part.
[03:38:38.001 --> 03:38:44.846]  Now, Miller's appeal of the subpoena goes before a three-judge panel at appeals court in D.C.
[03:38:45.626 --> 03:38:49.688]  And this is very important, where his lawyers expect to lose.
[03:38:50.448 --> 03:38:58.191]  That court is stacked with a Clinton and an Obama nominee, and we don't expect them to win at that level.
[03:38:59.032 --> 03:39:02.333]  Miller's lawyers say they will then appeal to the U.S.
[03:39:02.433 --> 03:39:03.333]  Supreme Court.
[03:39:04.034 --> 03:39:11.297]  Should that happen, I may even file amicus, because it is important that somebody point out the inherent conflicts
[03:39:12.097 --> 03:39:13.679]  of Mr. Rosenstein.
[03:39:29.255 --> 03:39:33.240]  And an official appointed by an elected official, Rod Rosenstein.
[03:39:33.961 --> 03:39:43.433]  No one has ever addressed the fact that the President and Mr. Rosenstein are both materially involved in the very matter that Mr. Mueller is investigating.
[03:39:43.853 --> 03:39:47.297]  And therefore they both have an inherent conflict.
[03:39:47.938 --> 03:40:03.955]  This was not raised by Mr. Miller's lawyers, nor was it raised by the Concord lawyers, the attorneys representing the Russian company that has also filed amicus challenging Mr. Mueller's authority.
[03:40:04.716 --> 03:40:07.518]  But I believe it will ultimately be raised.
[03:40:08.279 --> 03:40:15.143]  The real question, of course, is why is Mueller himself responding to the challenge by Miller in the courts?
[03:40:15.644 --> 03:40:18.406]  Why isn't the Justice Department responding to that?
[03:40:18.466 --> 03:40:29.394]  In fact, since the question is over Mr. Mueller's authority, why isn't he put in a box and the Justice Department's Solicitor General responding to this legal action?
[03:40:30.114 --> 03:40:33.578]  No, folks, this is a fraud upon the people.
[03:40:34.059 --> 03:40:38.124]  The investigation is what the president says it is, a witch hunt.
[03:40:39.746 --> 03:40:49.317]  Normally speaking, a special counsel is appointed when a crime has been identified and for some reason the Department of Justice has a conflict of interest
[03:40:49.958 --> 03:40:52.820]  In the prosecution of that identified crime.
[03:40:53.520 --> 03:40:59.564]  But in the case of the Russian collusion, delusion, no crime has been identified.
[03:41:00.184 --> 03:41:11.692]  Two years and 17 million dollars in, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has identified low-level, ham-handed, ineffective Russian meddling in our election.
[03:41:12.472 --> 03:41:24.123]  Nothing on the scale of R meddling in the recent Israeli election, or the massive tax dollars spent for the election of Boris Yeltsin in the former USSR.
[03:41:24.884 --> 03:41:29.528]  So, this entire saga is to be continued.
[03:41:30.048 --> 03:41:37.916]  Watch that lawsuit closely, expect a defeat at the appeals court level, and then we'll see if the US Supreme Court
[03:41:38.576 --> 03:41:42.439]  As newly constituted, we'll hear this important case.
[03:42:08.636 --> 03:42:14.923]  I will gladly, at my own expense, personalize it, autograph it, and mail it back to you.
[03:42:15.323 --> 03:42:17.165]  It will be my pleasure.
[03:42:17.826 --> 03:42:23.652]  On the other side, we'll bring up the address where you can mail your copy of Stone's Rules.
[03:42:23.752 --> 03:42:28.317]  But remember, this special offer, only available for InfoWarriors.
[03:42:45.746 --> 03:42:47.008]  It takes a lot of money to fight a war.
[03:42:47.028 --> 03:42:48.890]  It takes a lot of money to take on Soros.
[03:42:50.071 --> 03:42:51.893]  And I want to win this thing.
[03:42:51.973 --> 03:42:53.915]  And I think InfoWars should stay in the fight.
[03:42:53.935 --> 03:43:03.546]  If people don't go buy a bunch of t-shirts and water filters and air filtration and things you already need, non GMO heirloom seeds, high quality organic Wake Up America coffee grown in southern Mexico in the high mountains.
[03:43:03.726 --> 03:43:05.406]  And get the supplements, we will be destroyed.
[03:43:05.506 --> 03:43:08.107]  If you fund us with the millions of listeners we have, we're unstoppable.
[03:43:08.147 --> 03:43:12.188]  So, we've got Happy's, the new mood and stress natural herbal formula.
[03:43:12.268 --> 03:43:14.408]  Super concentrated, 50% off out of the gates.
[03:43:14.488 --> 03:43:16.269]  So you can try it and see how great it works.
[03:43:16.449 --> 03:43:17.449]  Works a little too good on me.
[03:43:17.489 --> 03:43:19.309]  My wife's like, what the hell are you on?
[03:43:19.489 --> 03:43:21.390]  It's totally natural, but it just smooths you out.
[03:43:21.410 --> 03:43:22.750]  It's not a depressant, not a stimulant.
[03:43:22.790 --> 03:43:23.450]  It's the opposite.
[03:43:23.490 --> 03:43:24.570]  It's just relaxing.
[03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:27.671]  Obviously, the FDA is in competition with Mother Nature.
[03:43:27.791 --> 03:43:31.874]  And so, you just need to read the ingredients on here and do your own research for yourself.
[03:43:32.014 --> 03:43:33.735]  And I'm just gonna tell you, they're very, very strong.
[03:43:33.755 --> 03:43:34.676]  They're very, very organic.
[03:43:34.696 --> 03:43:36.177]  They're very, very concentrated.
[03:43:36.277 --> 03:43:38.398]  Happy's contains ashwagandha root.
[03:43:38.498 --> 03:43:40.500]  And again, the rhodiola root is really the key.
[03:43:40.520 --> 03:43:41.661]  You need to look into that the most.
[03:43:41.741 --> 03:43:48.145]  Passion, flower, herb, green, tea, leaf, licorice root, and many other key ingredients that you need to research for yourself.
[03:43:48.365 --> 03:43:52.009]  All these ingredients combined to create an incredible formula to help fuel the mind and body.
[03:43:52.250 --> 03:43:52.750]  Amazing.
[03:43:52.810 --> 03:43:53.211]  Happies.
[03:43:53.391 --> 03:43:54.072]  Mood and Stress.
[03:43:54.112 --> 03:43:55.273]  Our newest product.

[03:44:12.585 --> 03:44:15.067]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years, turmeric.
[03:44:15.127 --> 03:44:17.288]  It's one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[03:44:17.669 --> 03:44:22.992]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[03:44:23.012 --> 03:44:31.358]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[03:44:31.699 --> 03:44:36.642]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[03:44:37.182 --> 03:44:38.924]  Right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:38.944 --> 03:44:40.465]  Please support this network.
[03:44:57.905 --> 03:45:01.628]  Drew's only been here about four or five months, and he's behind the camera right now.
[03:45:01.928 --> 03:45:07.812]  And I've just done this big pitch for our new product for women that is the best products, the best ingredients we can come up with.
[03:45:07.832 --> 03:45:09.994]  And he said, man, you need to reshoot this.
[03:45:10.674 --> 03:45:11.695]  Literally 20 seconds ago.
[03:45:11.715 --> 03:45:12.196]  And I said, what?
[03:45:13.226 --> 03:45:14.850]  He goes, what's that Virginia Slims ad?
[03:45:14.870 --> 03:45:19.840]  And I went, oh, the one about empowering women smoking cigarettes and killing themselves.
[03:45:19.900 --> 03:45:22.286]  He goes, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[03:45:24.505 --> 03:45:26.506]  And that just totally hit me like a ton of bricks.
[03:45:27.247 --> 03:45:36.572]  So hundreds of millions of women died of lung cancer because the whole feminist movement from the 20s and the 40s was funded by the cigarette makers to get women to smoke.
[03:45:36.672 --> 03:45:42.195]  And they continue that line into the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s saying, you've come a long way.
[03:45:42.635 --> 03:45:44.336]  You can smoke Virginia Slims.
[03:45:44.756 --> 03:45:46.137]  You too can die of lung cancer.
[03:45:46.737 --> 03:45:55.529]  So, Stephen Colbert and all these programs demonized me for promoting known herbs, known vitamins, known trace minerals that are so critical to women.
[03:45:55.749 --> 03:45:57.452]  My god, iodine is absolutely king.
[03:45:57.472 --> 03:45:58.533]  The good allergen.
[03:45:58.833 --> 03:46:03.980]  And then I'm the bad guy all over the news for promoting healthy formulas, but they are promoting
[03:46:04.921 --> 03:46:05.482]  Pure poison.
[03:46:05.562 --> 03:46:06.362]  So, hey.
[03:46:07.143 --> 03:46:08.344]  Yeah, women, you've come a long way.
[03:46:08.384 --> 03:46:09.445]  The families are broken up.
[03:46:09.485 --> 03:46:10.646]  Society's falling apart.
[03:46:10.866 --> 03:46:14.929]  Hundreds of millions of women, including one of my grandmothers, have died of lung cancer from cigarettes.
[03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:17.131]  But I'm saying we've all come a long way.
[03:46:17.171 --> 03:46:18.672]  Men and women as humans together.
[03:46:18.772 --> 03:46:19.853]  Black, white, old, young.
[03:46:20.453 --> 03:46:23.155]  Realizing that if you don't get vitamin C, you die of scurvy.
[03:46:23.195 --> 03:46:25.477]  If you don't have vitamin B12, you get cancer.
[03:46:25.717 --> 03:46:26.558]  It's that simple.
[03:46:26.658 --> 03:46:28.960]  And products like this new one we've developed
[03:46:29.800 --> 03:46:31.061]  Ultimate female force.
[03:46:31.501 --> 03:46:34.222]  This will do a lot better for you than Virginia Slims, believe me.
[03:46:34.783 --> 03:46:37.444]  So, yeah, you've come a long way, baby.
[03:46:37.504 --> 03:46:39.305]  With Infowarslife.com.
[03:46:45.888 --> 03:46:48.509]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.600 --> 03:47:18.341]  Welcome back.
[03:47:18.661 --> 03:47:32.549]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and we're bringing you the very latest political news, not to mention updates on the horrific hurricane that is poised to hit the Florida panhandle shortly.
[03:47:33.850 --> 03:47:40.554]  It is also, I want to tell you that my colleague Rob Dew and I will be up next on The War Room.
[03:47:40.574 --> 03:47:47.438]  We're going to be taking some of your calls and further breaking down the most up-to-date political news.
[03:47:48.179 --> 03:47:55.143]  For those of you who missed it the day before yesterday, Lori Gregory was on bringing us the very latest information.
[03:47:55.723 --> 03:48:12.247]  Regarding not only the war against mandatory vaccinations, but also an extraordinary effort by the health department officials in this administration to limit stem cell therapy.
[03:48:12.327 --> 03:48:22.449]  Yes, an extraordinary therapy in which a person's own stem cells are used to enhance their physicality and their health.
[03:48:23.450 --> 03:48:34.957]  For some extraordinary reason, the Trump administration seems to be committed to outlawing this extraordinarily successful therapy.
[03:48:35.558 --> 03:48:43.463]  Now, members of my own family have benefited from stem cell therapy for conditions such as arthritis.
[03:48:44.203 --> 03:48:46.445]  I know firsthand that it works.
[03:48:47.185 --> 03:48:53.407]  What could be unhealthy or inappropriate about the use of one's own stem cells?
[03:48:54.067 --> 03:48:59.168]  You have to scratch your head and wonder about how much of this the president knows.
[03:48:59.989 --> 03:49:03.790]  I recognize that he is focused on much larger issues.
[03:49:03.870 --> 03:49:11.592]  The confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, the unprecedented attempt to lynch Judge Kavanaugh,
[03:49:12.832 --> 03:49:19.595]  The peace talks with North Korea, which the President keeps speaking, hopefully, about.
[03:49:19.715 --> 03:49:22.055]  Remember, he knows more than we do.
[03:49:23.416 --> 03:49:27.818]  It is kind of funny when his critics say, what's taking so long?
[03:49:27.918 --> 03:49:28.938]  What's taking so long?
[03:49:29.598 --> 03:49:35.460]  You had 75 years, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush.
[03:49:35.920 --> 03:49:39.462]  You couldn't even get the North Koreans to open the door and sit down with you.
[03:49:40.282 --> 03:49:44.284]  The president's made unprecedented strides towards peace.
[03:49:44.944 --> 03:49:50.146]  We should never be afraid to meet, to talk, if the objective is peace.
[03:49:50.826 --> 03:49:54.108]  That's the importance of this administration and their focus.
[03:49:54.748 --> 03:50:08.834]  But one wonders about their continued appointment, the president's continued appointment, to mandatory vaxxers to virtually every public health and health-oriented position in this administration.
[03:50:09.614 --> 03:50:15.740]  The head of the FDA, a fellow named Gottlieb, he favors mandatory vaccinations.
[03:50:16.301 --> 03:50:20.164]  We'll talk about this and more coming up on The War Room.
[03:50:21.065 --> 03:50:29.193]  In the meantime, it is extraordinary to watch the Democratic Party self-immolate.
[03:50:29.974 --> 03:50:32.757]  They don't seem to know when they're beaten.
[03:50:33.874 --> 03:50:44.321]  The attempted lynching of Brett Kavanaugh has been very narrowly averted, but only averted by one single vote.
[03:50:45.509 --> 03:50:51.131]  But not knowing when they're beat, the Democrats have incredibly now doubled down.
[03:50:52.032 --> 03:51:14.181]  Congressman Jerry Nadler of Manhattan, who's in line to become the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in the unfortunate event that the Democrats win control of the House, has already announced that he will subpoena the Department of Justice, that he will subpoena the FBI, in essence admitting what we all know.
[03:51:14.901 --> 03:51:17.943]  They will seek the impeachment of Judge Kavanaugh.
[03:51:18.704 --> 03:51:19.625]  On what basis?
[03:51:20.225 --> 03:51:21.026]  Hard to say.
[03:51:21.546 --> 03:51:37.019]  There is no evidence, no proof, no eyewitnesses, no corroboration of the unfounded charge that Judge Kavanaugh is guilty of sexual assault or even worse, gang rape.
[03:51:37.699 --> 03:51:39.640]  This is a vile smear.
[03:51:40.261 --> 03:51:50.687]  But should we go there, I'm hopeful that the House Republicans on that panel will ask Dr. Ford about her connections to the Central Intelligence Agency.
[03:51:51.187 --> 03:51:55.270]  And we can get at who exactly her lawyers were.
[03:51:55.850 --> 03:52:05.756]  I'd also like to know, as the President has raised, the question of who leaked the Ford connection to Senator Feinstein.
[03:52:07.757 --> 03:52:14.422]  It's amazing that the double standard of justice that is held out for the Democrats.
[03:52:15.643 --> 03:52:34.458]  Dick Blumenthal, senator from my native state of Connecticut, actually has the nerve to read the Latin interpretation of the legal maxim that if a person is judged to have lied about one thing, well then it's reasonable to assume that they have lied about everything.
[03:52:35.822 --> 03:52:39.765]  Senator Blumenthal, you lied about serving in Vietnam.
[03:52:40.365 --> 03:52:47.430]  You lied about it in every single one of your campaigns for Attorney General, for the State Senate, and for the U.S.
[03:52:47.450 --> 03:52:47.811]  Senate.
[03:52:48.331 --> 03:52:50.232]  It was a long-term lie.
[03:52:50.773 --> 03:52:53.775]  Can we now assume that you have lied about everything?
[03:52:55.160 --> 03:52:59.243]  Senator Hirono, she says men should just sit down and shut up.
[03:52:59.923 --> 03:53:00.704]  But when U.S.
[03:53:00.724 --> 03:53:15.514]  Senator Daniel Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, the senior Democrat in the Democratic machine that has dominated Hawaiian politics, was accused of sexual assault by Lenore Kwok, a hairdresser,
[03:53:16.374 --> 03:53:23.781]  Hirono, then in her 12th year in the Hawaii legislature, said absolutely nothing.
[03:53:24.122 --> 03:53:29.847]  That's right, she was the one who shot up in the face of claims of sexual assault.
[03:53:30.588 --> 03:53:32.970]  I guess it wasn't politically correct.
[03:53:33.991 --> 03:53:39.314]  And then there's Spartacus, yes, Cory Booker, the empty suit.
[03:53:40.094 --> 03:53:53.840]  I have a book coming out called Spartacus, the real Cory Booker story, at the end of October, that outlines his epic corruption, dysfunction and failure as the mayor of Newark, New Jersey.
[03:53:54.481 --> 03:53:58.723]  As the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, he of course lived in Greenwich Village, New York.
[03:53:59.743 --> 03:54:09.690]  But as the mayor, a city water authority, the Watershed, voted to give $600,000 to Cory Booker's law firm.
[03:54:14.071 --> 03:54:26.538]  Booker claimed that he was unaware of this payment, but an examination of the minutes of that authority shows Booker as present and voting in favor of the $600,000 award.
[03:54:27.278 --> 03:54:32.181]  Of course, Booker's law firm quickly paid the money to, you got it, Cory Booker.
[03:54:32.941 --> 03:54:36.884]  Then Mayor Booker said, well, it was the buyout from his firm.
[03:54:36.944 --> 03:54:37.484]  No, no, wait.
[03:54:37.905 --> 03:54:39.586]  It was deferred compensation.
[03:54:39.626 --> 03:54:40.627]  No, wait a minute, that's wrong.
[03:54:41.127 --> 03:54:42.548]  In other words, he lied.
[03:54:43.128 --> 03:54:45.430]  This is graft, pure and simple.
[03:54:45.870 --> 03:54:52.595]  If Cory Booker were a Hispanic Republican, he'd be in the pokey right now, in the slammer.
[03:54:53.095 --> 03:54:58.900]  But he survives because he is a liberal Democrat and an empty suit.
[03:54:59.560 --> 03:55:08.311]  He made a fool of himself in the Senate hearings, and now he hopes to be able to base a presidential candidacy on that performance.
[03:55:09.012 --> 03:55:11.254]  Spartacus, wait till you read my book.
[03:55:11.375 --> 03:55:12.336]  You're gonna love it.
[03:55:12.776 --> 03:55:17.702]  It'll be available at the InfoWars.com store towards the end of October.
[03:55:18.323 --> 03:55:29.549]  Also coming up, Woodward and Bernstein, the godfathers of fake news, which I expose the fact that Bob Woodward has essentially lied about everything in his political career.
[03:55:30.209 --> 03:55:37.653]  He lies about his own background as a naval intelligence officer, where he briefed members of the Nixon White House staff.
[03:55:38.133 --> 03:55:40.534]  He lies about the identity of Deep Throat.
[03:55:41.015 --> 03:55:42.936]  He lies about Watergate.
[03:55:43.336 --> 03:55:45.397]  He lies about Iran-Contra.
[03:55:45.777 --> 03:55:51.682]  He lies about an interview with FBI Director Bill Casey that literally never took place.
[03:55:52.283 --> 03:55:56.206]  He lies about the late comic genius John Belushi.
[03:55:56.586 --> 03:55:59.369]  In fact, his entire life is a lie.
[03:55:59.709 --> 03:56:02.271]  His journalistic career is a lie.
[03:56:02.772 --> 03:56:05.634]  And he lies repeatedly in his latest book.
[03:56:06.095 --> 03:56:08.096]  So you can look for both of those.
[03:56:08.757 --> 03:56:20.179]  Woodward and Bernstein, The Godfathers of Fake News by Roger Stone and Tyler Nixon, and coming up right behind it, Spartacus, The Real Cory Booker Story.
[03:56:20.620 --> 03:56:23.400]  Look for them at the Infowars.com store soon.
[03:56:23.560 --> 03:56:36.063]  But while you're at it, go to the Infowars.com store right now and grab your copy of Stone's Rules, my field manual for success, whether you're in business, politics, tech,
[03:56:36.443 --> 03:56:38.125]  Or any other avocation.
[03:56:38.725 --> 03:56:45.592]  And if you grab that book at InfoWars now and mail it to me at this address, P.O.
[03:56:45.632 --> 03:56:54.560]  Box, well that's not the right address but it'll still work, 1007 North Federal Highway, number 166, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 33304.
[03:56:57.643 --> 03:57:02.906]  It will be my pleasure to sign it and return it to you personalized.
[03:57:03.307 --> 03:57:11.232]  We have an updated Hollywood Florida address, but both addresses are still good and you can still have time to get in on this offer.
[03:57:11.892 --> 03:57:22.339]  Coming up now on The War Room with my colleague Rob Due, we're going to be breaking down today's political news, an update on the hurricane, and taking your calls.
[03:57:22.699 --> 03:57:24.440]  We'll see you on the other side.
[03:57:25.061 --> 03:57:26.582]  Victory or death?
[03:57:50.519 --> 03:57:51.240]  You laughed at me.
[03:57:55.643 --> 03:57:58.024]  You've been in love with something else your whole life.
[03:57:58.925 --> 03:57:59.866]  And this is a love affair.
[03:58:01.307 --> 03:58:03.708]  And so, I'm not gonna get in bed with you.
[03:58:06.290 --> 03:58:08.531]  Because you don't love the spirit of justice.
[03:58:09.292 --> 03:58:11.153]  You love your father the devil.
[03:58:12.614 --> 03:58:14.896]  You love death more than life.
[03:58:16.104 --> 03:58:20.712]  So you go with your father forever.
[03:58:21.253 --> 03:58:21.894]  And that's hell.
[03:58:22.415 --> 03:58:23.457]  Separation from God.
[03:58:26.869 --> 03:58:28.671]  You'll never defeat the human spirit!
[03:58:28.851 --> 03:58:30.833]  You'll never defeat God!
[03:58:31.173 --> 03:58:32.975]  You'll never win!
[03:58:33.095 --> 03:58:34.476]  Never!
[03:58:34.657 --> 03:58:36.719]  Never ever!
[03:58:37.419 --> 03:58:40.702]  And this is where we get tested, so rejoice to God Almighty!
[03:58:40.763 --> 03:58:47.489]  You're coming up with more problems for us.
[03:58:47.589 --> 03:58:48.030]  Earthquake!
[03:58:48.050 --> 03:58:50.472]  We're having an earthquake!
