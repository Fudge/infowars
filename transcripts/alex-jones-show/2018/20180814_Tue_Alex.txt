[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.133]  Yeah.
[00:00:23.206 --> 00:00:24.908]  Only 84 days left.
[00:00:24.948 --> 00:00:26.869]  The most important election in U.S.
[00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:27.270]  history.
[00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.753]  The balance, not just of this country, but the world is in the balance.
[00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:42.143]  The CHICOMs are now openly involved in the manipulation of our internal elections in a big way.
[00:00:44.285 --> 00:00:45.546]  I'm going to go to a special report.
[00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:47.928]  When we come back, I'm going to re-kick off the transmission.
[00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:54.893]  Because we could not have more momentous things to deal with, more momentous issues to cover.
[00:00:56.494 --> 00:01:09.886]  And I'm just telling every listener and viewer, if you just tuned in for the first time, find out who we really are, not what the corporate media has to say about us and realize whether you're listening on local radio stations or TV stations, or whether you are.
[00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.160]  Listening to us online.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.765]  However you're listening or watching, spread the word because they're attempting to snuff out not just our First Amendment, but your First Amendment right now.
[00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:26.211]  And even the Washington Times has one of their military correspondents and Fox News contributors saying they believe the Chi-Coms are behind my deplatforming.
[00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:29.474]  But first, I want to go to this short report.
[00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:34.378]  H3 podcast stream is terminated for talking about Alex Jones.
[00:01:34.658 --> 00:01:37.040]  We reported this over the weekend, but there's many examples of this.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.661]  But now we actually have the video.
[00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:39.242]  Here it is.
[00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:46.517]  Alex Jones, you all know him, the notorious conspiracy theorist, right-wing.
[00:01:46.597 --> 00:01:48.898]  I want to say a lot of people consider him right-right-wing.
[00:01:49.238 --> 00:01:50.258]  I don't consider him right-wing.
[00:01:50.318 --> 00:01:52.478]  I consider him an alien.
[00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.900]  I feel like making him affiliated with a political party is like trying to pin down what country you exist to on Mars.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.082]  He was recently banned by YouTube, Apple, Spotify, and Facebook.
[00:02:08.502 --> 00:02:08.822]  Banned.
[00:02:09.022 --> 00:02:10.042]  All the channels removed.
[00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:22.121]  Just days after banning Alex Jones from their platform, YouTube cut off the popular H3 livestream just minutes after they began discussing Alex Jones.
[00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:26.423]  And for what it's worth, they were defending YouTube.
[00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:29.204]  I don't think he really believes what he says.
[00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:33.706]  Like, about all the crazy stuff that... Well...
[00:02:34.626 --> 00:02:37.068]  That's definitely debatable.
[00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:40.070]  Hey guys, let me cut in real quick.
[00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:44.132]  Yeah, wow.
[00:02:44.252 --> 00:02:45.513]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:46.754]  They just killed our stream.
[00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:48.234]  Really?
[00:02:48.374 --> 00:02:48.575]  Yep.
[00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:49.375]  Why?
[00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:51.056]  Community guidelines.
[00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:51.997]  Wow.
[00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:53.838]  We can't even show his footage.
[00:02:54.744 --> 00:02:55.004]  What?
[00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:56.006]  What?
[00:02:56.026 --> 00:02:57.668]  Are you fucking stupid?
[00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:58.069]  I'm not.
[00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.151]  Because it's been removed?
[00:02:59.551 --> 00:03:07.082]  We were live streaming and right as we were getting into it, you guys saw if you're watching the VOD, YouTube, in their infinite wisdom,
[00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:11.465]  Removed our live stream and gave us a strike.
[00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:15.027]  Which, basically, when you get a strike, you can't live stream anymore.
[00:03:15.427 --> 00:03:20.029]  So some genius over at LiveTube... LiveTube?
[00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.130]  I'm having a f***ing... I'm not!
[00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:24.631]  You see what it's doing to me?
[00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:32.515]  I'm... My whole rant, as I was just getting into, was very... I'm taking YouTube's side.
[00:03:33.453 --> 00:03:48.568]  That Alex Jones is a crazy conspiracy theorist, who violated the Terms of Service, was doing all this s*** that shouldn't be- by YouTube's Terms of Service, shouldn't be allowed, and what the f*** does YouTube do?
[00:03:51.255 --> 00:03:52.856]  They're like, you know what we need to do?
[00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:54.718]  Ethan is defending us.
[00:03:55.198 --> 00:03:59.441]  Ethan is defending us against Alex Jones right now.
[00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:09.069]  Do you know what we can do in one fell swoop to legitimize Alex Jones and to piss Ethan off and turn him against us?
[00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:13.472]  Let's shut his channel down and give him a strike mid-livestream.
[00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:16.295]  It's brilliant.
[00:04:16.575 --> 00:04:17.115]  Let's do that.
[00:04:17.476 --> 00:04:17.976]  Shut it down.
[00:04:18.016 --> 00:04:18.316]  What the f***?
[00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:21.449]  Full reports on Infowars.com.
[00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.751]  This is being done to a lot of people.
[00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.152]  It's called deplatforming.
[00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:25.973]  It's like China.
[00:04:26.653 --> 00:04:30.636]  If you talk about the dictator looking like Winnie the Pooh, you get banned from the internet.
[00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:37.742]  It's a global social score, and you guys complying with it, all you podcasters going along with it are going to bring it into America.
[00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:39.903]  This is the admitted global plan.
[00:04:41.825 --> 00:04:46.969]  Now, when we come back, ladies and gentlemen, the big news is straight ahead.
[00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:50.318]  They are preparing fake n-word tape.
[00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:55.603]  We've been warning of this for years, and of course YouTube deleted our video about it, detailing how they can do it.
[00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:57.826]  If they already had it, they would have already used it.
[00:05:04.445 --> 00:05:05.406]  Hey, have you heard?
[00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:07.969]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[00:05:08.049 --> 00:05:09.350]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.571]  They're all censoring us.
[00:05:10.932 --> 00:05:16.837]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[00:05:17.138 --> 00:05:20.141]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[00:05:31.144 --> 00:05:35.327]  Everything we do here at InfoWars is possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:35.347 --> 00:05:36.468]  We have huge specials.

[00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.973]  New t-shirts at the InfoWars store as well, including one that I just got.
[00:05:45.394 --> 00:05:47.975]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:50.097]  Very, very cool logo.
[00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:56.261]  And kind of more discreet, so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:59.383]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:59.403 --> 00:06:00.864]  Huge discount store-wide right now.
[00:06:12.194 --> 00:06:13.435]  There's a big event coming.
[00:06:14.716 --> 00:06:15.817]  A group of big events.
[00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:17.298]  A firestorm.
[00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.902]  We're now only 84 days out from the most important election in U.S.
[00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:22.183]  history.
[00:06:23.376 --> 00:06:27.317]  November 8th, 2016 only established the beachhead to return the Republic.
[00:06:27.697 --> 00:06:32.239]  Prosperity began to come almost instantly, as the globalist boot was lessened on our neck.
[00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:45.103]  But now, they're striking back with every form of propaganda and disinformation they've got, and they're deplatforming and banning conservatives, nationalists and patriots across the board, as Communist China spreads its wicked wings.
[00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:47.965]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:49.707]  This is the info war.
[00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:56.974]  Why is Amorosa out there floating this fake n-word tape that she's never heard or never seen but some aides told her they might have heard?
[00:06:57.655 --> 00:07:07.325]  It's all been cooked up from the beginning according to our inside sources that warned of Amorosa when he first hired her that she was a Trojan horse set up to make sure the black vote doesn't go to Trump.
[00:07:07.805 --> 00:07:08.725]  Why are they panicking?
[00:07:09.265 --> 00:07:12.586]  With African Americans and Hispanics, Trump's numbers have doubled in the last year.
[00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:14.547]  No Republicans ever had such support.
[00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.208]  The landslide's accelerating.
[00:07:17.028 --> 00:07:19.188]  The Democratic Party wants to keep folks on the plantation.
[00:07:19.709 --> 00:07:21.329]  And to stop things like this.
[00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.430]  We are drugged out!
[00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.351]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.751]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:32.871]  Today, it all changes.
[00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:35.712]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:07:35.932 --> 00:07:38.773]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:07:39.013 --> 00:07:43.474]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:46.375]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:07:46.395 --> 00:07:48.915]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:51.196]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:53.097]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:07:53.317 --> 00:07:54.477]  We have the resources.
[00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:01.175]  You know, sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:02.676]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:04.437]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:08:04.477 --> 00:08:05.358]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:08:05.558 --> 00:08:06.458]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:08.860]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.702]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:08:14.202 --> 00:08:17.744]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:08:18.305 --> 00:08:20.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.427 --> 00:08:33.531]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday worldwide broadcast.
[00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:37.735]  Hard to believe it's already the 14th day of August 2018.
[00:08:40.197 --> 00:08:44.360]  We have a lot of news, obviously, to break down and a lot of news to cover here.
[00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:52.627]  They are cracking down, not just on myself, but thousands of other prominent nationalists and conservatives in organized crime.
[00:08:53.668 --> 00:08:57.291]  They have CNN and the mainstream corporate media lying about what we've said and done
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.003]  To build the straw man and then have us de-platformed to set the precedent for everyone else to be de-platformed.
[00:09:06.704 --> 00:09:08.865]  And it's all moving into high gear.
[00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:22.492]  Now coming up in the next segment, I'm gonna lay out the scientific facts, the evidence, what we covered a year and a half ago about Photoshop for voice faces backlash two years ago.
[00:09:22.552 --> 00:09:27.735]  They released it to a limited group, had to pull it back because it can break voice print codes.
[00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.654]  It is indistinguishable from the real person's voice.
[00:09:34.036 --> 00:09:40.304]  If they can get a recording of you for even 30 seconds, they can perfectly fake it.
[00:09:40.384 --> 00:09:42.707]  And now, you know they would have used an N-word tape.
[00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:48.478]  If they had it back during the election or after, but they haven't.
[00:09:49.259 --> 00:09:54.982]  So now it's, oh, AIDS talking about, yeah, we hear there's one, he feels real bad about it.
[00:09:55.042 --> 00:09:58.143]  As if you can't get operatives inside the White House, which we know happened.
[00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:01.245]  We know Emma Rosa, we warned about Trump hiring her to begin with.
[00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:03.106]  Roger Stone is joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:08.189]  We know that it's very easy for people to then sit there
[00:10:09.167 --> 00:10:20.293]  And basically repeat rumors or say whatever they want, and then that becomes the thing that counters double the number of black Americans, Hispanic Americans supporting Trump as they see the economy coming back, optimism.
[00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:25.295]  You know, the lie about saying he hates all Mexicans and says they're all rapists and criminals never was said.
[00:10:25.335 --> 00:10:30.898]  He said, a lot of great people coming across, we just want to vet who they are, but you've also got a lot of rapists and murderers coming across, which is totally true.
[00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:35.180]  And the left is so behind covering this up that when the guy
[00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:40.327]  Shoot Kate Steinlein in the back and she dies.
[00:10:42.688 --> 00:10:46.750]  The government and the system says she's wonderful out in San Francisco and they let her go.
[00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.230]  They let the killer go.
[00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.791]  Even though he admits he shot her in the back.
[00:10:52.452 --> 00:10:57.374]  And there's other examples of that coming up today with all these Islamic terror attacks that we've been seeing.
[00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:01.573]  With Westminster, it's been attacked several times by cars.
[00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:03.496]  Four people run over, thank God none of them are dead.
[00:11:04.156 --> 00:11:09.343]  We've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cars all over Sweden with the Stockholm Syndrome burned by Islamic gangs.
[00:11:10.783 --> 00:11:20.592]  You've got the media for a week with the report and the police saying they found a dead body of a child who'd been tortured and summed up a ritual, reportedly, according to the police, allegedly, but they have now admit there's a dead body.
[00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:29.880]  And underground tunnels and all these weapons, and they said they had witnesses that talked to the kids and others that gave them tips that they were starving to death and didn't have water and were being trained for this.
[00:11:30.621 --> 00:11:35.906]  And the liberal judge, because they got up and said, oh, you're racist, oh, you're bad, oh, you're evil,
[00:11:38.553 --> 00:11:51.481]  The lawyer got up and said that for the five Muslim men who are connected to the famous mosque and all the rest of it and the World Trade Center bombing in the early 1990s, she releases them on $20,000 bond.
[00:11:53.242 --> 00:11:54.844]  That's $2,000 you have to pay.
[00:11:54.864 --> 00:11:59.487]  And waives that fee altogether and says she feels sorry for them.
[00:12:02.068 --> 00:12:03.709]  So that's the level of censorship.
[00:12:03.749 --> 00:12:07.352]  That's the level of virtue signaling that's going on.
[00:12:08.422 --> 00:12:23.213]  That the lawyer, I have the transcript here, for the Islamicist, said that if they were white or Christian, they wouldn't be here.
[00:12:26.136 --> 00:12:27.777]  We have that video and audio coming up as well.
[00:12:29.199 --> 00:12:30.840]  And it's just crazy.
[00:12:31.761 --> 00:12:56.582]  If you are Christian, and in a compound with rubber tires around it, and underground tunnels with starving people, and they found the body of a dead kid who got reported missing from another state, and the families are calling the police saying, please do something, and they just released people who had the body, admittedly, of a dead child who died in a ritual, according to witnesses,
[00:12:57.825 --> 00:13:18.270]  No, if you were a group of white people or black people or Hispanics or anybody else and you were out in a compound with tunnels in the ground and there's a dead body and the witnesses that called about it said they're training to go do school shootings and attack police, you would not be released from jail five days after you got arrested.
[00:13:24.514 --> 00:13:32.700]  But that's what, I mean, you can't even hardly find in the news that these are Islamic attacks in Sweden, or Islamic attacks in England, or Islamic attacks going on constantly.
[00:13:34.521 --> 00:13:35.462]  That's coming up as well.
[00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:46.289]  And then obviously the big story, all the censorship that's going on, and how it's expanding, and how people have got to counter it.
[00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:49.632]  But first, the whole Amorosa situation, when we come back,
[00:13:55.874 --> 00:13:57.054]  From the break on the other side.
[00:13:58.015 --> 00:14:03.357]  It's just, this is the coordinated attempt by the globalists to bring this country down.
[00:14:03.417 --> 00:14:04.237]  Let me stop right there.
[00:14:05.438 --> 00:14:10.079]  As everyone knows, we have had unmitigated attacks.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.201]  They're trying to take our servers down right now.
[00:14:13.441 --> 00:14:16.742]  They are filing false reports, criminal false reports.
[00:14:18.514 --> 00:14:27.919]  Corporations, individuals, boards of governors of privately traded companies are defaming us with the claims they put out in the news for PR and to curry favor with big tech.
[00:14:31.981 --> 00:14:32.621]  It's all happening.
[00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:34.102]  This is how they shut down America.
[00:14:34.402 --> 00:14:36.903]  This is how they bring the Chinese style credit score to America.
[00:14:37.203 --> 00:14:40.985]  This is how they bring you can neither buy nor sell to America if you're not a good globalist.
[00:14:42.602 --> 00:14:45.183]  They've taken us off 26 platforms.
[00:14:45.463 --> 00:14:47.784]  They're trying to get our credit card processing right now.
[00:14:48.165 --> 00:14:57.349]  They kicked us off Credio after we were kicked off AdRoll last year, saying that we're promoting hatred when all we were selling was water filters, air filters, and high-quality supplements.
[00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.210]  We are being put into a
[00:15:01.641 --> 00:15:02.882]  Electronic gulag.
[00:15:03.543 --> 00:15:06.967]  We're being removed from the electronic ghetto, the electronic gulag.
[00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:11.492]  We're moving from being shadow banned to totally banned, and it's an incredibly dangerous time.
[00:15:12.272 --> 00:15:21.142]  And I want to thank you all for your support, and thank you all for spreading the word, but the globalists are betting you're going to forget about what they've done to us, and everybody else, and just move on.
[00:15:21.202 --> 00:15:23.805]  No, this is the big issue for Congress, for the President,
[00:15:25.097 --> 00:15:29.240]  In fact, I had a stack in there from last night when I went live till 10 and I really need it bad.
[00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:36.185]  It had the new Senator Warner stuff where he wants EU-style censorship and to shut down quote fake news.
[00:15:36.646 --> 00:15:40.428]  And then I had the Chris Murphy news and all the rest of it saying shut us down.
[00:15:40.468 --> 00:15:43.190]  So they're all official now saying they're coming for all of you.
[00:15:44.096 --> 00:15:52.365]  Now, we have the only news app that has a 5.0 rating, a perfect rating, and is number one, and so they obviously want to shut that down, too.
[00:15:52.645 --> 00:15:54.407]  That's how un-American these people are.
[00:15:54.447 --> 00:15:59.413]  They want to control what you hear and see, and they're allied with the greatest mass murderers in history, the Chycomps.
[00:16:04.182 --> 00:16:09.709]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:17.519]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:20.944]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:26.226]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.927]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:38.171]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:16:38.311 --> 00:16:49.942]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, Pau Darko Bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:54.886]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:54.986 --> 00:16:56.668]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:00.723 --> 00:17:03.705]  Right now is Massive Rampage Force!
[00:17:03.785 --> 00:17:04.245]  Go ahead.
[00:17:04.505 --> 00:17:10.089]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:11.389]  I'd done the War Room.
[00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.131]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:15.712]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[00:17:15.752 --> 00:17:16.392]  I was exhausted.
[00:17:16.692 --> 00:17:19.994]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[00:17:20.315 --> 00:17:24.957]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[00:17:25.037 --> 00:17:27.059]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[00:17:27.219 --> 00:17:27.739]  Uh, the same thing.
[00:17:27.759 --> 00:17:29.861]  I'm going to put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:31.182]  I'm going to go on the Tucker tonight.
[00:17:31.202 --> 00:17:33.463]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[00:17:33.483 --> 00:17:39.488]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[00:17:39.768 --> 00:17:40.609]  You can sleep with it.
[00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:45.232]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[00:17:45.292 --> 00:17:48.075]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[00:17:48.235 --> 00:17:49.956]  This is the best combination I have found.
[00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:50.757]  It really works.
[00:17:50.997 --> 00:17:55.560]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[00:17:55.941 --> 00:17:57.582]  I wasted a lot of money on old foods,
[00:17:57.722 --> 00:17:58.142]  Believe me.
[00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:03.706]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:18:03.726 --> 00:18:06.989]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:18:07.489 --> 00:18:13.313]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:18:13.774 --> 00:18:16.556]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:18:17.276 --> 00:18:20.738]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:18:21.098 --> 00:18:27.160]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:32.543]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:18:33.297 --> 00:18:36.699]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:43.762]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:49.105]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:54.728]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:18:55.328 --> 00:18:59.290]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:18:59.929 --> 00:19:01.870]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:02.310]  Go ahead.
[00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.791]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.852]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:08.672 --> 00:19:09.793]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:10.113 --> 00:19:11.834]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:12.534 --> 00:19:14.615]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:18.856]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:18.876 --> 00:19:21.357]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:22.178 --> 00:19:24.518]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:24.859 --> 00:19:25.979]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:26.219 --> 00:19:27.099]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:28.360]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.841]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:29.881 --> 00:19:30.962]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:31.802]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.062 --> 00:19:37.426]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:37.746 --> 00:19:42.029]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:42.249 --> 00:19:45.131]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:45.771]  You understand?
[00:19:45.851 --> 00:19:47.152]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:47.492 --> 00:19:48.673]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:49.634 --> 00:19:54.557]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:19:55.498 --> 00:19:56.198]  Do you understand?
[00:19:56.218 --> 00:19:57.399]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:20:03.724 --> 00:20:07.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.979 --> 00:20:30.206]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.747 --> 00:20:32.748]  Okay, I'm going to get into
[00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:42.721]  This operation inward that the Democrats in the deep state have launched to try to keep black Americans and others on the Democratic Party plantation.
[00:20:44.983 --> 00:20:49.926]  Because they are absolutely waking up and coming over to the side of Trump.
[00:20:50.407 --> 00:20:52.448]  And I'm seeing it on the ground with everybody I know.
[00:20:52.468 --> 00:20:54.449]  That's very, very exciting.
[00:20:54.489 --> 00:20:57.632]  So right on time, this whole thing comes in here.
[00:20:58.874 --> 00:21:09.788]  To derail that, if they had a tape of Trump doing this, if NBC had a tape or anybody else had a tape, they would have already played that tape back in the election.
[00:21:11.357 --> 00:21:13.398]  And they would already be trying to leverage that on Trump.
[00:21:13.758 --> 00:21:14.578]  Trump has denied it.
[00:21:15.138 --> 00:21:16.078]  He says it's not true.
[00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:27.181]  And he says they also heavily edited the famous thing from him, you know, 14 years ago or whatever, 13 years ago, on the bus, where they're out there recording him, knowing he's mic'd up, about to come out.
[00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:30.302]  Imagine being the president now, surrounded with everybody with phones.
[00:21:31.682 --> 00:21:32.383]  They're trying to edit it.
[00:21:32.443 --> 00:21:33.683]  They're trying to take it out of context.
[00:21:33.763 --> 00:21:34.303]  It's incredible.
[00:21:36.024 --> 00:21:37.544]  And I've experienced this with Megyn Kelly.
[00:21:39.045 --> 00:21:52.349]  YouTube has now deleted the video that had millions of views, where I showed what I did live on air, unedited, where I said, I don't know if Hillary's running child sex rings, but I know she represented child molesters in court, made jokes about it, said she didn't care.
[00:21:52.629 --> 00:21:54.189]  Her husband settled a bunch of rape cases.
[00:21:54.389 --> 00:21:57.470]  They're in bed with Epstein, politically, flying around on his airplane.
[00:21:57.770 --> 00:21:59.171]  He's a known child sex trafficker.
[00:22:00.438 --> 00:22:07.881]  But her funding the Middle East and her funding the Arab Spring has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent people, tens of thousands of women and children sold into sex slavery.
[00:22:08.661 --> 00:22:10.002]  And then I showed news articles.
[00:22:11.522 --> 00:22:23.067]  So I said, so she is guilty of raping and murdering children because under federal law and common law, if you're the mafia boss and you order a murder, you're just as guilty as the person that does the murder.
[00:22:23.107 --> 00:22:24.087]  In fact, more.
[00:22:24.347 --> 00:22:25.228]  It's capital murder.
[00:22:25.408 --> 00:22:26.148]  It's premeditated.
[00:22:28.168 --> 00:22:29.449]  So I said, so she is guilty.
[00:22:29.789 --> 00:22:33.871]  That was video, sitting here in this chair, with an American flag behind me, whole nine yards.
[00:22:34.572 --> 00:22:41.055]  They took it, edited it, played audio on Fox News, Megyn Kelly, saying I said there were kids in a basement, and that she murdered them.
[00:22:42.296 --> 00:22:43.857]  They edited two different shows together.
[00:22:44.257 --> 00:22:45.938]  That is crim now.
[00:22:46.598 --> 00:22:48.039]  That is pure evil.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.283]  So, I've experienced this, and I've seen them say that Trump took Martin Luther King's bust out.
[00:22:56.323 --> 00:22:57.364]  It was right there in the video.
[00:22:58.084 --> 00:23:02.287]  Or they didn't visit Congressman Scalise, or he fed the fish wrong, or blah blah blah.
[00:23:03.108 --> 00:23:08.551]  And by the way, we have some cards in the deck we haven't played dealing with what Trump thinks about black people.
[00:23:09.232 --> 00:23:12.154]  And I've been asked not to play those cards, so I'm not going to play those cards.
[00:23:13.427 --> 00:23:15.348]  People ask me not to, I won't, but it's the truth.
[00:23:15.808 --> 00:23:17.228]  Robert Stone's joining us for the next segment.
[00:23:17.248 --> 00:23:26.292]  I want to play little snippets of the edited audio that CBS is playing, and then I want to show you what the real issue here is, because this is mainstream news right here.
[00:23:26.852 --> 00:23:30.253]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[00:23:30.933 --> 00:23:31.834]  That's Reason.com.
[00:23:32.054 --> 00:23:33.514]  They're already doing it.
[00:23:34.815 --> 00:23:36.355]  They're already doing it.
[00:23:37.176 --> 00:23:39.516]  You don't announce an operation when you're doing it.
[00:23:40.437 --> 00:23:41.177]  We're in the middle of it.
[00:23:42.574 --> 00:23:43.214]  Zero Hedge.
[00:23:43.935 --> 00:23:44.775]  The Revenge of Hillary.
[00:23:44.795 --> 00:23:46.917]  Senator Mark Warner proposes the end of free speech.
[00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:56.583]  A week after this came out, in reason, he now goes public and says, yeah, we're going to adopt EU rules that totally shut down free speech.
[00:23:56.663 --> 00:23:59.544]  I told you, Google and Facebook are going under EU fines.
[00:23:59.705 --> 00:24:00.845]  That's why this is coming here.
[00:24:01.225 --> 00:24:02.306]  And the Chinese are involved.
[00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:04.788]  This is foreign powers meddling in the internet.
[00:24:05.228 --> 00:24:07.569]  Trump's leaving the web alone as Mr. Capitalist.
[00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.632]  But that's the same as giving it to China and the EU, Mr. President.
[00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:19.813]  Senator Murphy, Infowars, the tip of a giant iceberg of hate and lies that uses sites like Facebook and YouTube to tear our nation apart.
[00:24:21.335 --> 00:24:24.357]  These companies must do more than take down a website.
[00:24:24.377 --> 00:24:26.038]  The survival of our democracy depends on it.
[00:24:26.058 --> 00:24:27.439]  They mean their corrupt globalist system.
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.402]  And then Noam Chomsky for four days warns this is pure evil.
[00:24:31.482 --> 00:24:32.563]  No one covers it but Drudge.
[00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:37.546]  They're making their move.
[00:24:37.706 --> 00:24:39.868]  Now, before I go to this tape,
[00:24:41.704 --> 00:24:43.285]  Let's look at these articles right here.
[00:24:43.606 --> 00:24:49.651]  This is from years ago, and you can go to Infowars.com and read our articles about it, but our videos demonstrating it are gone.
[00:24:49.671 --> 00:24:52.133]  We'll have to redo the videos demonstrating.
[00:24:52.453 --> 00:25:06.165]  Now, we can record my voice and have me just read out the newspaper for 30 seconds, and then you can type in what you want it to say, and in a minute, it translates it and is my voice, and you could have me never saying the N-word,
[00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:09.108]  And you could have me saying whatever you wanted.
[00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:12.111]  You could have me saying the most outlandish things.
[00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:13.873]  Adobe creates voice Photoshop.
[00:25:15.174 --> 00:25:18.237]  The technology allows users to alter speakers' words.
[00:25:18.678 --> 00:25:18.237]  2016.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.123]  But the sensors say, nope, we can't see that now.
[00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:25.663]  All destroyed.
[00:25:26.244 --> 00:25:29.685]  Photoshop for voices faces backlash.
[00:25:29.705 --> 00:25:38.690]  They put it on the market, BBC reported, pulled it off because it allows people to take public recordings and then get voice prints, whatever you want, and frame people.
[00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:40.771]  So that's the report.
[00:25:41.171 --> 00:25:42.272]  Read about Adobe VoCo.
[00:25:42.292 --> 00:25:43.552]  There's many other programs that do it.
[00:25:43.933 --> 00:25:47.674]  You've all seen, you know, 20 years ago Forrest Gump shake hands with JFK.
[00:25:47.815 --> 00:25:48.455]  It never happened.
[00:25:49.926 --> 00:25:50.846]  This is how they fake it.
[00:25:50.886 --> 00:25:51.647]  This is how they do it.
[00:25:51.727 --> 00:25:53.607]  So, if they had the tape, they would have released it.
[00:25:54.047 --> 00:26:01.430]  But now they get people talking about rumors, people who denied it, people that said, you know, that it hadn't been said with this Frank Luntz.
[00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.311]  And then now, again, it's back to it.
[00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:10.153]  And then, obviously, if they're hypothetically talking about what if this comes out, then they're going to discuss how to spin it.
[00:26:10.893 --> 00:26:12.534]  So, these are all highly edited tapes.
[00:26:12.594 --> 00:26:15.555]  Someone illegally recorded a lot of this in the Situation Room.
[00:26:16.479 --> 00:26:17.323]  This is just amazing.
[00:26:17.344 --> 00:26:18.932]  Let's go ahead and go to that tape.
[00:26:20.558 --> 00:26:27.400]  Manigault Newman claims to have heard a recording of President Trump using the N-word during his time on The Apprentice.
[00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.440]  You would never imagine he'd talk that way.
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:35.902]  In her new book, Unhinged, Omarosa claims the Trump campaign was aware of the existence of the tape.
[00:26:36.402 --> 00:26:47.445]  She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynne Patton, then assistant to Eric Trump, spokesperson Katrina Pierson, and campaign communications director Jason Miller.
[00:26:47.925 --> 00:26:51.967]  ...in which they discuss how to deal with the potential fallout from its release.
[00:26:52.348 --> 00:26:58.391]  Patton then described a conversation she had with then-candidate Trump about making the slur.
[00:27:07.156 --> 00:27:11.658]  I said, well, sir, can you think of any time that this might have happened?
[00:27:11.678 --> 00:27:12.538]  And he said, no.
[00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:14.359]  Well, that's not true.
[00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:16.780]  He goes, how do you think I should handle it?
[00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:23.544]  And I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa, which is, well, it depends on what scenario you're talking about.
[00:27:24.384 --> 00:27:26.925]  And he said, well, why don't you just go ahead and put it to bed?
[00:27:27.565 --> 00:27:29.106]  I don't know what the scandal is.
[00:27:29.446 --> 00:27:30.127]  Yeah, he said it.
[00:27:30.147 --> 00:27:30.887]  He's embarrassed.
[00:27:31.267 --> 00:27:33.808]  Pearson denied the call ever took place.
[00:27:33.848 --> 00:27:34.589]  Hit pause again.
[00:27:34.689 --> 00:27:35.229]  Back to show.
[00:27:36.075 --> 00:27:38.016]  Notice they're saying Trump said he didn't do it.
[00:27:38.096 --> 00:27:39.276]  So they're just wargaming.
[00:27:39.716 --> 00:27:40.596]  What if this is real?
[00:27:40.636 --> 00:27:41.757]  And he goes, no, it's not real.
[00:27:42.197 --> 00:27:43.897]  And Amorosa goes, no, that's not true.
[00:27:44.737 --> 00:27:47.158]  She's in there recording this, setting everybody up.
[00:27:48.198 --> 00:27:50.019]  And they can't even get what they want.
[00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:54.200]  And so now they're trying to pick this all apart because people sat there and wargamed it.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.740]  Let's continue.
[00:27:56.606 --> 00:28:02.029]  Pearson denied the call ever took place during an interview on Fox News Monday night.
[00:28:02.049 --> 00:28:04.571]  Katrina Kirsten said he said it.
[00:28:05.311 --> 00:28:05.952]  Did that happen?
[00:28:06.912 --> 00:28:07.473]  No, Ed.
[00:28:08.013 --> 00:28:09.074]  That did not happen.
[00:28:09.094 --> 00:28:11.375]  It sounds like she's writing a script for a movie.
[00:28:13.376 --> 00:28:14.517]  CBS thinks you're stupid.
[00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:16.298]  We're going to go over this some more today.
[00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:18.780]  She said he denied it.
[00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:22.842]  Amorosa goes, that's not true, until she's recording a phone call.
[00:28:23.263 --> 00:28:28.985]  So what she's saying is, is it isn't true that he did say he said it, not that she didn't have the phone call.
[00:28:29.506 --> 00:28:38.750]  And imagine trying to remember all this, while Amorosa, who begged for the job, is running around, this reality TV star, with the recording, wanting to be somebody big in mainstream media.
[00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:40.391]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:40.811 --> 00:28:41.832]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[00:28:41.872 --> 00:28:44.693]  Please remember, without you, you are who finances InfoWars.
[00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:45.593]  We won't be here.
[00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:51.356]  Go get some Mean as a Wolverine, Reelect45, InfoWars.com, Moe Enlabe shirts.
[00:28:51.376 --> 00:28:52.097]  They're all there.
[00:28:52.157 --> 00:28:54.978]  There's no excuse not to support free speech and InfoWars.
[00:28:55.198 --> 00:28:58.520]  We've got the globalists on the run, but we need your support now more than ever.
[00:28:59.548 --> 00:28:59.968]  Who has the
[00:29:17.537 --> 00:29:22.880]  First aid management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second degree burns, skin irritations.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.321]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[00:29:25.441 --> 00:29:27.763]  Some medical grade stores have it.
[00:29:27.943 --> 00:29:29.404]  It's just incredible.
[00:29:29.484 --> 00:29:30.404]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[00:29:30.484 --> 00:29:31.665]  This is next level.
[00:29:31.725 --> 00:29:33.226]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:37.929]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:42.691]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[00:29:42.811 --> 00:29:46.273]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[00:29:46.434 --> 00:29:47.674]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[00:29:47.834 --> 00:29:54.698]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist, and we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospitals.
[00:29:55.319 --> 00:29:59.721]  And he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[00:29:59.982 --> 00:30:01.983]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:04.824]  We're triple A from 5-3-3-1-3-9.
[00:30:05.424 --> 00:30:11.927]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said, find me the ultimate silver.
[00:30:12.467 --> 00:30:16.729]  Find me what is the weapons grade they're using in the military, hospitals, you name it.
[00:30:17.089 --> 00:30:17.570]  This is it.
[00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.271]  There's only one other silver stronger and it's by prescription.
[00:30:20.371 --> 00:30:26.814]  This stuff is thermonuclear, nanotech, super small particles which go in electromagnetically, just goes right into the heart of something.
[00:30:29.986 --> 00:30:43.614]  The silver wound dressing gel contains the powerful silver saw technology that revolutionized the colloidal nano silver markets as the only FDA certified wound treatment product of its kind.
[00:30:43.734 --> 00:30:51.418]  This gel has been shown to fight infection and irritation while also helping speed up the healing process.
[00:30:51.618 --> 00:30:53.799]  And that's the way I like it.
[00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:56.220]  Grab a bottle of super silver wound
[00:30:59.022 --> 00:30:59.862]  We're good to go.
[00:31:18.448 --> 00:31:24.792]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[00:31:25.613 --> 00:31:30.856]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[00:31:31.457 --> 00:31:43.605]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[00:31:44.265 --> 00:31:49.788]  Makaru from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[00:31:50.568 --> 00:31:54.090]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:59.433]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle today.
[00:32:03.976 --> 00:32:11.479]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:32:11.979 --> 00:32:25.065]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:32:26.525 --> 00:32:29.868]  Transdimensionally, over the space-time continuum, through full space.
[00:32:30.329 --> 00:32:34.452]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:32:34.672 --> 00:32:38.656]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[00:32:39.448 --> 00:32:55.575]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling!
[00:32:55.775 --> 00:32:56.476]  InfoWars.
[00:32:56.876 --> 00:32:58.456]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:33:03.319 --> 00:33:05.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.041 --> 00:33:16.824]  Yeah.
[00:33:23.286 --> 00:33:25.428]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:25.908 --> 00:33:27.589]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:40.999]  I wanted to get Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign on because when Trump was getting ready to hire Omarosa, he flipped out on air and I know begged the White House not to do it, warned them.
[00:33:42.139 --> 00:33:47.103]  Here's Morgan has come out and said that she tried to get him to have sex with her to win Celebrity Apprentice.
[00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:50.307]  You can hear these tapes.
[00:33:50.327 --> 00:33:53.909]  You don't know if they're talking about the grabber by the you-know-what tape, this tape.
[00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.951]  Did Trump say the n-word?
[00:33:56.051 --> 00:33:57.112]  No, he says he didn't.
[00:33:57.792 --> 00:33:59.333]  No one's saying they heard a tape of this.
[00:33:59.374 --> 00:34:09.801]  This is all just rumors and innuendo of a lady running around with a phone for almost a year inside the White House and before that working with the campaign.
[00:34:11.623 --> 00:34:14.365]  But she's got a history in Haiti, too, so we're talking to Roger about this.
[00:34:14.425 --> 00:34:16.886]  But this is how they try to derail things.
[00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:18.568]  Meanwhile, even mainstream news
[00:34:20.031 --> 00:34:34.176]  Is having to admit that the shy comms are more and more taking control of this country and that they are the ones financing and pushing the takedown of yours truly off of the internet.
[00:34:34.416 --> 00:34:35.296]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:34:35.356 --> 00:34:39.137]  China is the threat and it may be too late.
[00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:46.440]  The Washington Times, L. Todd Wood, who's a national security advisor to Fox News contributor,
[00:34:47.674 --> 00:34:49.375]  Military veteran from Special Operations.
[00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:52.637]  I'm not going to get into all the things he's done from the U.S.
[00:34:52.697 --> 00:35:03.324]  Air Force Academy, but he lays it out right here, some other scholarly work, that everything is CHICOM run, except the military and a few branches of the government.
[00:35:03.364 --> 00:35:06.526]  They totally took us over with the help of the Democrats and the globalists.
[00:35:06.566 --> 00:35:13.731]  So remember when somebody's trying to get us back under the control of the people and bring back prosperity, that the CHICOMs
[00:35:17.133 --> 00:35:22.014]  Are literally manipulating and controlling Hollywood and Netflix and all of it.
[00:35:22.334 --> 00:35:23.535]  All this anti-American stuff.
[00:35:23.575 --> 00:35:24.595]  All this race war stuff.
[00:35:24.955 --> 00:35:26.275]  All the sexualization of children.
[00:35:26.856 --> 00:35:28.196]  That's all illegal in China.
[00:35:29.096 --> 00:35:29.956]  But they're doing it here.
[00:35:30.737 --> 00:35:31.497]  We'll be getting into that.
[00:35:31.537 --> 00:35:33.237]  That report is on Infowars.com.
[00:35:33.717 --> 00:35:36.338]  Will you guys tweet this out on Watson's Twitter and on MinePlace?
[00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:39.840]  Please tweet it from the Washington Times, not from InfoWars.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.240]  I did post it in full.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.781]  I don't normally do that, but it's all about me and it's very, very accurate.
[00:35:43.961 --> 00:35:52.204]  So I posted the whole thing on InfoWars.com and I'm going to tweet the Washington Times version to the world because it's so important.
[00:35:52.224 --> 00:35:53.765]  So understanding the threat, there it is.
[00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:58.006]  We'll get more into that coming up and the censorship that's happening.
[00:35:58.046 --> 00:35:59.287]  But right now, let me lay this out.
[00:36:00.373 --> 00:36:02.194]  They are suing us and trying to shut us down.
[00:36:02.835 --> 00:36:08.418]  Those suits aren't going well, but it's costing hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars for the big suits to defeat them.
[00:36:09.419 --> 00:36:12.100]  And they've got three Sandy Hook lawsuits.
[00:36:12.861 --> 00:36:14.882]  They've got a bunch of others that are very, very serious.
[00:36:15.542 --> 00:36:18.944]  If they can shut us down, it will be a big victory for the globalists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:20.265 --> 00:36:26.149]  And they admit a overturning of the New York Times versus Sullivan, and basically the First Amendment.
[00:36:28.157 --> 00:36:40.783]  We could defeat this and we can be strong, but they're trying to take our payment processors, they've taken our Credio, third-party advertising so we can't advertise on platforms, just supplements and air filtration, water filtration.
[00:36:42.024 --> 00:36:46.085]  We're not just here on air trying to get you to finance this operation.
[00:36:46.446 --> 00:36:55.290]  I reach out to other audiences and advertise, spend a lot of money to bring in the money we need to fund this operation.
[00:36:56.201 --> 00:36:58.322]  I love capitalism and I love businessmen and women.
[00:36:58.962 --> 00:37:01.282]  This is a patriot military operation.
[00:37:02.082 --> 00:37:05.903]  A organic resistance to the globalists.
[00:37:06.643 --> 00:37:07.704]  And so that's how I see it.
[00:37:07.884 --> 00:37:08.924]  I'm an independent Texan.
[00:37:08.984 --> 00:37:09.624]  I'm an American.
[00:37:10.444 --> 00:37:11.885]  I know the globals are trying to take over.
[00:37:12.045 --> 00:37:13.185]  I built a system to fight them.
[00:37:13.505 --> 00:37:14.445]  We've been successful.
[00:37:14.485 --> 00:37:16.246]  We've helped reboot the resistance worldwide.
[00:37:16.526 --> 00:37:17.066]  Not just here.
[00:37:18.516 --> 00:37:19.377]  And the enemy knows that.
[00:37:19.577 --> 00:37:21.438]  So do you know how important InfoWars is?
[00:37:21.498 --> 00:37:22.259]  I know a lot of you do.
[00:37:22.419 --> 00:37:22.999]  Pray for us.
[00:37:23.019 --> 00:37:23.519]  Support us.
[00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:24.880]  Spread the articles, the videos.
[00:37:25.341 --> 00:37:27.062]  Tell people by hand, with little cards.
[00:37:27.622 --> 00:37:29.864]  Find out about Verboten InfoWars.
[00:37:30.264 --> 00:37:30.704]  You've done it.
[00:37:30.744 --> 00:37:32.545]  We have a 5.0 app.
[00:37:33.686 --> 00:37:38.589]  The only app in the App Store that's new is we're number one in both formats of Android and Apple.
[00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.771]  I tweeted this out at Real Alex Jones.
[00:37:40.811 --> 00:37:41.651]  I'll put it on screen, please.
[00:37:43.513 --> 00:37:44.173]  It is number...
[00:37:46.344 --> 00:37:48.805]  One, and it is a 5.0.
[00:37:50.105 --> 00:37:52.586]  Just go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter, like I said during the break.
[00:37:53.846 --> 00:37:54.607]  Not a setup for that.
[00:37:55.467 --> 00:38:05.950]  Just go to Real Alex Jones on Twitter, and it's one of the tweets from today, that it's a 5.0 in the Apple Store.
[00:38:06.711 --> 00:38:10.212]  And so that's why they're trying to get rid of it.
[00:38:12.372 --> 00:38:14.413]  That's why they're trying to remove it.
[00:38:15.768 --> 00:38:19.729]  Is because we launched it a month ago and it went into the top 40.
[00:38:20.609 --> 00:38:21.089]  Unheard of.
[00:38:21.729 --> 00:38:26.671]  Then it shot past the New York Times, CNN, Fox News, everything to the top.
[00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:29.291]  They don't know what to do.
[00:38:29.351 --> 00:38:31.472]  It's going to go to number one period very, very soon.
[00:38:31.952 --> 00:38:32.732]  Not just in news.
[00:38:33.492 --> 00:38:35.093]  So, what happens when you're number one?
[00:38:35.393 --> 00:38:36.933]  CNN lobbies to have it removed.
[00:38:38.547 --> 00:38:45.392]  That is Chinese Communist-type behavior, and they have military officers in high-level Pentagon positions saying, no, it's the Chai Koms.
[00:38:45.632 --> 00:38:46.753]  Well, I was told it was.
[00:38:46.773 --> 00:38:56.199]  I was talking about Apple officially moving to China, Google helping censor over there and here, and we're helping put oxygen into that fire that'll save the country, and I'm a patriot.
[00:38:56.599 --> 00:39:00.122]  And I love all of you, and I know you appreciate me, but I'm just telling you.
[00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:10.733]  You need to go to InfoWarsTore.com and you need to get products that are game-changing, like our Vitamin Mineral Fusion Fruit Punch for adults and children with the amino acids, or DNA Force Plus.

[00:39:13.914 --> 00:39:15.955]  It's got very expensive PQQ, CoQ10.
[00:39:16.015 --> 00:39:17.416]  It's just huge levels in it.

[00:39:20.677 --> 00:39:22.657]  It's so turbocharged, be careful when you take it.
[00:39:24.318 --> 00:39:24.898]  It's amazing.
[00:39:25.058 --> 00:39:27.179]  Supramole vitality, cold press.
[00:39:27.499 --> 00:39:28.980]  Very similar to Alpha Power, but a different formula.
[00:39:30.777 --> 00:39:34.744]  All super blue products, fluoride-free, colloidal silver, fortified toothpaste.
[00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:40.674]  Fluoride-free toothpaste, fortified with colloidal silver and iodine for adults and children.

[00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:03.927]  BioTruth Selenium.
[00:40:03.987 --> 00:40:05.248]  Selenium's an amazing thing.
[00:40:06.348 --> 00:40:07.269]  People die without it.
[00:40:07.289 --> 00:40:08.049]  You have to have that.
[00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.830]  You have to have iodine.
[00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:09.690]  It's electrochemical.
[00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:10.351]  You use it in the brain.
[00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:16.575]  We have it from the mustard seed, the purest selenium you're going to find organic out there.
[00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:17.617]  BioTrue Selenium.

[00:40:30.899 --> 00:40:32.300]  Please be sponsors for them as well.
[00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:39.687]  But whatever you do, understand this is a war, and if they can shut us down, we have the Democrats officially saying they're going after everybody.
[00:40:39.928 --> 00:40:44.792]  And I want to spend a few minutes on that with Roger Stone, who's being sued by Obama and the globalists and everybody else.
[00:40:44.812 --> 00:40:46.734]  They're trying to set him up as well.
[00:40:46.774 --> 00:40:48.356]  We'll get into Amoroso when we come back.
[00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:52.840]  But in the few minutes we have here, I just read earlier when we started this segment,
[00:40:54.175 --> 00:41:08.101]  The Democrats are, it was secret documents a month ago, now they're officially saying, we're gonna go with the EU model and the Chinese model, and we're gonna have credit scores, and if you criticize the government or anybody, you're not gonna be able to buy or sell, and we're gonna fine everybody, and we're gonna end freedom for our democracy.
[00:41:08.141 --> 00:41:08.721]  Those are quotes.
[00:41:08.781 --> 00:41:12.582]  This is, there should be millions in the streets calling for their resignations.
[00:41:12.622 --> 00:41:18.705]  They have gone pure authoritarian, Roger, and they're planning something big in the next 84 days before the election, I believe.
[00:41:22.483 --> 00:41:26.284]  What's been amazing is the way you've called this from the very beginning.
[00:41:27.205 --> 00:41:41.970]  The phony harassment lawsuits, distorting what you said about Sandy Hook, distorting what you said about other important matters in the media, the false accusations against you that you were
[00:41:42.794 --> 00:41:46.375]  grooming someone who worked at InfoWars for gay sex.
[00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:48.696]  The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
[00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:54.618]  These were all laid out there to generate distorted negative headlines.
[00:41:54.938 --> 00:42:07.222]  Then they take those headlines and they use them as the rationale to bump InfoWars and everything we do here off of all of these important social media platforms.
[00:42:07.663 --> 00:42:08.403]  It's insidious.
[00:42:09.184 --> 00:42:14.168]  It was a plan, it was formulatic, and you called it from the very beginning.
[00:42:14.768 --> 00:42:18.792]  Well, I've seen what they've done in other countries, what they've done where they're banning speech in France and in Brazil.
[00:42:18.972 --> 00:42:28.639]  We're going to talk about this more a little bit in the next hour when I come back into Amorosa and their big play, obviously, to get minorities not to vote for Republicans in the midterms and not to vote for their American birthright and freedom.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.584]  They've been doing similar things to you, Roger, and the reason they had to panic and fully de-platform us is it wasn't working.
[00:42:35.644 --> 00:42:45.150]  But think about how bold that is, listeners and viewers, to literally begin unpersoning someone off of every platform, and then targeting those that even talk about you or show you.
[00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:58.579]  This is the total end of free speech, using the big Google-Facebook system to censor everybody, with the head of Apple orchestrating the whole thing from his slave factories in China.
[00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.892]  Court hearings will resume today in lawsuits against radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:05.032 --> 00:43:06.093]  I don't know exactly what happened.
[00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:07.473]  Sandy Hook's ain't conclusive.
[00:43:07.673 --> 00:43:15.757]  For years, Alex Jones was the most powerful voice behind a disturbing conspiracy theory that the Sandy Hook shooting was a massive hoax.
[00:43:15.797 --> 00:43:18.178]  He has claimed the school shooting was a hoax.
[00:43:18.298 --> 00:43:25.801]  Alex Jones is making news and the parents of the victims of the Sandy Hook shooting in Connecticut are quite disturbed by some of the messages he's sending out.
[00:43:26.021 --> 00:43:30.504]  People who believe Jones have for years harassed and taunted families of the victims.
[00:43:31.025 --> 00:43:34.968]  The lawsuits filed in April seek at least $1 million in damages.
[00:43:35.008 --> 00:43:44.234]  Jones' comments have caused them a severe degree of mental stress and anguish, which have disrupted their daily routine and caused a high degree of psychological pain.
[00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:49.458]  Parents have said Jones has engaged in a campaign of false, cruel and dangerous assertions.
[00:43:49.538 --> 00:43:54.222]  A theory that Leonard Posner and Veronique de la Rosa say turned their lives upside down.
[00:43:54.522 --> 00:44:04.187]  The parents of six-year-old Noah Posner, who was killed in the Sandy Hook massacre, say Jones' followers have tormented them with death threats, forcing them to move seven times.
[00:44:04.207 --> 00:44:06.989]  I can't imagine being a Sandy Hook parent and having to go through this.
[00:44:07.129 --> 00:44:10.290]  Alex Jones, his commentary about Sandy Hook is disgusting.
[00:44:10.571 --> 00:44:11.331]  It's appalling.
[00:44:11.351 --> 00:44:12.592]  We all stand against it.
[00:44:12.612 --> 00:44:13.012]  9-11 as well.
[00:44:13.032 --> 00:44:13.172]  9-11.
[00:44:13.252 --> 00:44:16.774]  On the left and the right, we stand against this kind of hate speech, which is what it is.
[00:44:16.934 --> 00:44:21.898]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:44:21.938 --> 00:44:23.920]  They're alleging in these lawsuits a conspiracy.
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:32.086]  A reporter in the courtroom said that Jones' attorney told the judge today his client's comments are political speech and commentary and not defamatory.
[00:44:32.207 --> 00:44:34.969]  I take a lot of flack coming on your show and representing you.
[00:44:35.149 --> 00:44:36.910]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:39.293]  Like, you know, good friends, family.
[00:44:39.473 --> 00:44:41.335]  Like you said, CNN's not calling anymore.
[00:44:41.615 --> 00:44:47.641]  And I say, well, you know, tell me, if you're so, you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is.
[00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:53.787]  And they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article saying, you know, paraphrasing what you said.
[00:44:53.827 --> 00:44:56.189]  I said, yeah, but now bring me to the original source.
[00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:00.093]  And when I go find it, I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[00:45:00.894 --> 00:45:02.674]  Well then, you know, then there's this backpedal.
[00:45:02.694 --> 00:45:06.035]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[00:45:06.075 --> 00:45:10.496]  There was another lawsuit this week targeting people that promote conspiracy theories.
[00:45:10.516 --> 00:45:14.277]  It involves InfoWars and the host of InfoWars, Alex Jones.
[00:45:14.617 --> 00:45:29.600]  Already InfoWars is at risk of losing its YouTube channel, and now this lawsuit is trying to take Jones and InfoWars and others to court, saying they're responsible for promoting hoaxes that actually are defamatory toward the people involved.
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.360]  CNN has been
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.163]  Basically a murder for free speech for the last 25 hours.
[00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:38.791]  At the same time, they're telling us how important it is that people should be able to say what they think.
[00:45:39.231 --> 00:45:42.816]  They are agitating for Alex Jones to be pulled off YouTube.
[00:45:42.856 --> 00:45:48.603]  Now I know we're supposed to think that Alex Jones is way more radical than like Bill Maher, Michelle Wolf, or Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:45:49.164 --> 00:45:53.025]  But he's got a point of view, and CNN is trying to squelch his point of view.
[00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:57.006]  Alex Jones promotes conspiracy theories and foments hatred of media.
[00:45:57.486 --> 00:45:59.827]  He's been called a freak show and downright dangerous.
[00:45:59.907 --> 00:46:06.969]  People have free speech in this country, but no matter how hateful, no matter how stupid, no matter how inane, give them their time, give them Thorazine also.
[00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:09.270]  What is the matter with this person?
[00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:11.891]  I don't like giving people like Alex Jones a platform.
[00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:14.853]  The hypocrisy is just astounding.
[00:46:15.093 --> 00:46:20.576]  And I guarantee you that if you flipped over to CNN right now, there would not be a single story about the Twitter shadow banning.
[00:46:20.736 --> 00:46:21.716]  There would not be a single story.
[00:46:21.896 --> 00:46:35.103]  And the only story you would see about YouTube pulling Alex Jones videos would be probably something celebratory about, you know, a scalp of sorts for managing to eventually get their way.
[00:46:35.663 --> 00:46:36.283]  On that story.
[00:46:36.403 --> 00:46:42.084]  Jones' lawyers will be back in court for a separate defamation case related to the Parkland shooting tomorrow.
[00:46:42.124 --> 00:46:48.226]  This was probably the first time that anybody in that courtroom had actually watched Infowars.
[00:46:48.366 --> 00:46:49.706]  Had actually seen what you said.
[00:46:50.366 --> 00:46:57.848]  And if you watch what you said, and you compare that to what the press has reported that you said, it's as if those two things are happening on two different planets.
[00:47:04.174 --> 00:47:06.790]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.686 --> 00:47:18.928]  Sweden is on fire after organized car firebombing blitz.
[00:47:20.269 --> 00:47:24.151]  Another car rammed into four pedestrians at Parliament in England.
[00:47:24.311 --> 00:47:28.714]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:29.174 --> 00:47:30.695]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.075 --> 00:47:33.296]  A liberal judge from Austin, Texas.
[00:47:33.656 --> 00:47:38.059]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[00:47:40.089 --> 00:47:49.455]  A liberal judge just released five people living in an armed compound with tunnels of starving children and the dead body of a young teenage boy.
[00:47:51.436 --> 00:47:54.398]  Because their lawyer said it was racist to hold them.
[00:47:56.599 --> 00:48:04.584]  Even though witnesses and people that contacted the police said that they were allegedly training for mass shootings and an uprising to kill police.
[00:48:05.304 --> 00:48:09.287]  Vimeo said that when I reported that it was fake news and banned me two days ago.
[00:48:11.108 --> 00:48:13.309]  I am sworn to defend this republic.
[00:48:14.649 --> 00:48:17.130]  And I gotta tell you, Roger Stone's here with us for this segment and the next.
[00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:24.212]  I wanna get into the whole Amorosa thing, but Roger, they are working around the clock to take our servers down right now.
[00:48:24.552 --> 00:48:28.454]  I've gotta have people up here at like midnight just to keep InfoWars.com up.
[00:48:29.034 --> 00:48:30.654]  NewsWars.com is up.
[00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.015]  PrisonPlanet.com's up.
[00:48:32.755 --> 00:48:35.998]  Europe Wars was down earlier today with stuff going on.
[00:48:36.078 --> 00:48:38.280]  I mean, we are under DDoS attacks, everything.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.363]  And it just becomes the normal background that everyone's recording the president and editing it.
[00:48:42.643 --> 00:48:45.206]  Amorosa was the African-American liaison first.
[00:48:45.486 --> 00:48:49.369]  Sounds like they're talking about how to spend what's reportedly... So remember, they leaked it.
[00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:51.291]  Oh, also on the NBC tape.
[00:48:51.471 --> 00:48:52.452]  You can see what's happening now.
[00:48:53.638 --> 00:48:57.781]  Our best dead reckoning on this is that he'd always said that was edited.
[00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.262]  They're discussing, grab him by this.
[00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:00.904]  They say, did he say the N-word?
[00:49:01.004 --> 00:49:01.624]  No, he didn't.
[00:49:01.704 --> 00:49:03.245]  Amorosa goes, that's a lie.
[00:49:04.767 --> 00:49:06.508]  Jumps in, it's clearly all edited.
[00:49:06.788 --> 00:49:11.011]  Trump's denying it, but the media's spinning it like the aides are saying it was true.
[00:49:11.232 --> 00:49:14.914]  But when we played the audio earlier, we'll play it again in a moment, that's not what you hear, Roger.
[00:49:15.135 --> 00:49:17.897]  But let's get into Amorosa herself and her character first.
[00:49:19.992 --> 00:49:21.093]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:49:21.474 --> 00:49:39.634]  As you know, we broke the story here at InfoWars that early in the Trump administration that Omarosa had persuaded the president to send a delegation from the White House to Haiti for the inauguration
[00:49:40.567 --> 00:49:58.529]  of the new regime, which is really the old corrupt regime with some new front men that has robbed the Haitian people blind, which stole all of the earthquake relief money after that horrific natural disaster.
[00:49:59.259 --> 00:50:02.121]  Uh, I think she should have been fired right then and there.
[00:50:02.522 --> 00:50:09.987]  The common denominator was a Democratic political consultant named Ron Daniels, who is a friend of Amorosa's.
[00:50:10.368 --> 00:50:16.012]  Amorosa traveled to Haiti with- By the way, let's go back, because I want to- give me those exact headlines.
[00:50:16.032 --> 00:50:18.494]  I remember you- I was like, get off this Amorosa thing.
[00:50:19.114 --> 00:50:25.379]  You were coming on, you know, back then, like almost every day, and it was Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa, Amorosa.
[00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:30.384]  And you said, listen, she's a Democratic operative, she's going to set things up, and she's tied to corruption in Haiti.
[00:50:30.404 --> 00:50:32.006]  So, what were the headlines back then?
[00:50:32.026 --> 00:50:33.408]  Because I want to pull those up for viewers.
[00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:38.313]  The actual headline, I think, is, why is Omarosa helping the Clintons rape of Haiti?
[00:50:40.397 --> 00:50:43.079]  I think it's up on the InfoWars site.
[00:50:43.859 --> 00:50:47.101]  I believe it's also up at the Stone Cold Truth site.
[00:50:47.161 --> 00:50:49.062]  I think we cross-posted it at the time.
[00:50:49.583 --> 00:50:56.707]  I interviewed Azealia Odonto right here on InfoWars about this at least twice.
[00:50:57.267 --> 00:50:58.688]  So, this woman is evil.
[00:50:58.808 --> 00:51:00.129]  She is not one of us.
[00:51:00.229 --> 00:51:03.551]  Now, I recognize why during the campaign
[00:51:04.271 --> 00:51:15.798]  Having a person of color willing to campaign for the president to someone who knew him personally, someone who could attest that he is not a racist, he's not, was valuable.
[00:51:16.718 --> 00:51:21.941]  And she was loyal to Trump and Trump was loyal to her during the campaign.
[00:51:22.442 --> 00:51:30.827]  I think she did an extraordinary disservice to the Trump administration and to the country, fronting for these criminals in Haiti.
[00:51:31.767 --> 00:51:32.327]  But now,
[00:51:33.812 --> 00:51:38.353]  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
[00:51:39.213 --> 00:51:41.154]  She was soaking up a huge paycheck.
[00:51:41.594 --> 00:51:43.214]  She was doing nothing.
[00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:47.255]  She was abusive to other members of the staff.
[00:51:47.835 --> 00:51:55.217]  She seemed to think because she had a prior personal relationship with the president that the rules did not apply to her.
[00:51:55.257 --> 00:51:56.617]  Let's just get down to brass tacks.
[00:51:57.457 --> 00:51:59.818]  Trump doesn't dislike black people or black women.
[00:52:02.435 --> 00:52:03.616]  We need to win this midterm.
[00:52:04.416 --> 00:52:08.078]  So, I just, I have to know, there's some real ace cards floating around out there.
[00:52:08.098 --> 00:52:12.440]  And I just wonder, Roger, will that ever come out?
[00:52:14.001 --> 00:52:14.902]  Well, look.
[00:52:14.982 --> 00:52:16.102]  About Trump and Amorosa?
[00:52:17.443 --> 00:52:21.425]  I don't think Donald Trump ever had a romantic relationship with Amorosa.
[00:52:21.925 --> 00:52:26.848]  I do know that he did once date an African-American supermodel.
[00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:29.650]  Oh wait, so you're going to go ahead and put this out now?
[00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:30.190]  Go ahead.
[00:52:31.068 --> 00:52:44.879]  At a time that he was single, a woman who appeared multiple times on the cover of Vogue, a stunningly beautiful woman who happened to be African-American, he was single, she was single, so much for the idea that he is a racist.
[00:52:44.919 --> 00:52:47.301]  He doesn't have a racist bone in his body.
[00:52:47.542 --> 00:52:52.065]  And Roger, there's even more to the story, but we're just going to leave it at that, because this has not been reported.
[00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:57.550]  And I really think, regardless of what the president wants, at a certain point, we have to do what's best for him.
[00:52:58.479 --> 00:53:08.405]  Well, I'm going to be in Dallas, pardon me, I'm going to be in Austin for the next two days, and I think perhaps we can lay this whole story out, because I know Donald Trump.
[00:53:08.425 --> 00:53:08.845]  40 years.
[00:53:09.285 --> 00:53:10.306]  He is not a racist.
[00:53:10.326 --> 00:53:15.069]  Well, let's just say that you were his wingman, and you know abso-100% literally he's not a racist.
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.360]  I know that for a fact.
[00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:22.541]  Look at some of his friends.
[00:53:23.281 --> 00:53:25.501]  Mike Tyson, Don King.
[00:53:26.042 --> 00:53:36.764]  Look at his courtship of this absolutely stunning black model, who was really on the cover of Vogue, I believe, three or four times, which is a record.
[00:53:37.424 --> 00:53:45.106]  Perhaps Anna Rosa may have aspired to have a romantic relationship with him when he was single, but I doubt he was interested.
[00:53:45.126 --> 00:53:48.027]  And now she turns out to be a lying viper.
[00:53:48.907 --> 00:53:56.510]  Let's take, for example, the claim in her book that the Republican pollster Frank Luntz heard Trump use the N-word.
[00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:56.950]  Not true.
[00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.490]  Well, I know Luntz.
[00:53:58.570 --> 00:54:00.391]  I've known him since he was 13 years old.
[00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:01.631]  He denies it.
[00:54:01.891 --> 00:54:06.733]  He said he never heard anything whatsoever, and that she never confirmed the same with him.
[00:54:07.193 --> 00:54:09.674]  So, look, her book is a piece of garbage.
[00:54:10.054 --> 00:54:16.396]  Well, I was about to say, though, I'm going to play this tape when we come back, but if you listen to it, the women are like, no, he said he didn't say it.
[00:54:17.156 --> 00:54:17.877]  But then they move on.
[00:54:17.897 --> 00:54:18.798]  Well, what about the other stuff?
[00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:19.799]  Well, he's embarrassed about it.
[00:54:19.819 --> 00:54:23.964]  They're talking at the time, during the campaign, about the famous grabber by the you-know-what tape.
[00:54:24.364 --> 00:54:27.929]  So, you can tell it's all edited, and then the women are saying, no, he didn't say it.
[00:54:27.969 --> 00:54:29.591]  She's like, no, no, that's a lie.
[00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:32.174]  You can see her trying to set him up back then.
[00:54:33.376 --> 00:54:34.376]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:54:34.456 --> 00:54:35.697]  This is all about her.
[00:54:35.917 --> 00:54:39.318]  It's all about her being fired in the blow to her ego.
[00:54:40.138 --> 00:54:41.999]  She was trying to acquire power.
[00:54:42.059 --> 00:54:45.100]  She was trying to acquire turf inside the White House.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.541]  But essentially, she's incompetent.
[00:54:48.041 --> 00:54:53.483]  And she was not even effective in her outreach to the black community on behalf of this administration.
[00:54:53.923 --> 00:54:55.584]  My question is an obvious one, Alex.
[00:54:55.964 --> 00:54:59.225]  What's going to matter more to African American voters?
[00:55:00.341 --> 00:55:04.166]  The lowest unemployment rate among black Americans in U.S.
[00:55:04.206 --> 00:55:04.607]  history.
[00:55:05.516 --> 00:55:09.099]  Or the fact that Emma Rosa is butthurt about being fired.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.021]  I think the answer is pretty clear.
[00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:16.065]  Well, even the Democrats at first said, illegally recording people in the Situation Room, saying Kelly threatened her.
[00:55:16.085 --> 00:55:16.986]  That's the standard deal.
[00:55:17.026 --> 00:55:18.007]  Hey, you ought to resign.
[00:55:18.447 --> 00:55:19.488]  This will be a lot easier.
[00:55:19.508 --> 00:55:21.350]  I wouldn't tar your name.
[00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:22.711]  I wouldn't look disgruntled.
[00:55:22.911 --> 00:55:23.912]  We'll try to help you out.
[00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:25.713]  We'll give you a good recommendation.
[00:55:25.954 --> 00:55:30.517]  That's the standard deal when you work in a media or governmental type deal, is hey,
[00:55:31.311 --> 00:55:33.092]  You know, you've been doing some stuff you're not supposed to.
[00:55:33.132 --> 00:55:33.973]  We now know what that was.
[00:55:34.033 --> 00:55:38.296]  Running around grandstanding, violating security, recording people, which is all confirmed.
[00:55:38.336 --> 00:55:39.776]  He's saying, be nice, we'll play nice.
[00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:40.997]  And she calls that a threat.
[00:55:41.197 --> 00:55:43.659]  I call that somebody, you know, trying to give you a chance.
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.960]  I couldn't agree more.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.763]  Look, we know that she asked to hold her wedding in the Rose Garden.
[00:55:50.504 --> 00:55:54.825]  No staff member has ever held a wedding in the Rose Garden.
[00:55:55.585 --> 00:56:00.066]  Members of the First Family, Tricia Nixon, for example, was married there.
[00:56:00.186 --> 00:56:03.687]  One of President Johnson's daughters was married there.
[00:56:04.287 --> 00:56:05.207]  That's appropriate.
[00:56:05.268 --> 00:56:06.808]  Staff members, not appropriate.
[00:56:07.108 --> 00:56:14.990]  So when that request is rejected by General Kelly, Omarosa just barges into the place and does what she wants anyway.
[00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:17.490]  There's grounds for firing right there.
[00:56:18.051 --> 00:56:19.811]  So this is all about her.
[00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:25.815]  What's amazing to me is the way the mainstream media, particularly CNN, has whipped this into a story.
[00:56:25.895 --> 00:56:27.416]  This is tabloid crap.
[00:56:27.776 --> 00:56:33.480]  We've got the Chinese communists on the verge of taking over this country by the hijacking order.
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:38.884]  It's even worse, the sales of all our technology, and all they want to talk about is Omarosa.
[00:56:39.464 --> 00:56:40.184]  Tired of it!
[00:56:40.705 --> 00:56:41.425]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:41.445 --> 00:56:43.606]  We're going to air this tape and then talk about the censorship.
[00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:46.807]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:46.887 --> 00:56:50.629]  And please don't forget, we'll tell you about the Stone Legal Defense Fund when we come back.

[00:56:54.991 --> 00:56:55.771]  We appreciate you.
[00:56:55.811 --> 00:56:57.212]  Without you, we will not be here.

[00:57:28.507 --> 00:57:31.609]  And then the head of Apple, quarterbacking it, had a meeting and said he's getting too much attention.
[00:57:31.929 --> 00:57:32.709]  No more coverage.
[00:57:32.769 --> 00:57:36.471]  Well, we're covering it here, and thanks to DrugsReport.com, it's getting out as well.

[00:58:09.029 --> 00:58:10.649]  Only a master of evil, Darth.
[00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:16.711]  Your power's a weak old man.
[00:58:17.211 --> 00:58:18.231]  You can't win, Darth.
[00:58:19.151 --> 00:58:23.552]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine.
[00:58:37.315 --> 00:58:38.335]  No!

[00:59:57.180 --> 00:59:58.484]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:14.398 --> 01:00:21.882]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:26.784]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:27.224 --> 01:00:31.066]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:00:31.406 --> 01:00:33.027]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:38.471 --> 01:00:43.238]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[01:00:43.618 --> 01:00:49.927]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates.
[01:00:50.367 --> 01:00:52.891]  Tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly.
[01:00:53.211 --> 01:00:58.875]  And a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:59.215 --> 01:01:10.022]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[01:01:10.042 --> 01:01:14.225]  But then the record skips, you hear the car crash sound, and all of it's gone.
[01:01:14.305 --> 01:01:16.206]  Five billion views, all of it destroyed.
[01:01:16.827 --> 01:01:19.168]  Because they don't want people to go back and see how right we've been.
[01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:19.809]  They're desperate.
[01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:25.751]  That I am, unfortunately, having to prepare legal action to defend the First Amendment.
[01:01:26.071 --> 01:01:29.812]  And I've got letters going out to Google right now because they worked with a cartel to ban us.
[01:01:29.832 --> 01:01:30.793]  They made a big mistake.
[01:01:31.253 --> 01:01:34.134]  They're in antitrust violation right now, caught dead to rights.
[01:01:36.138 --> 01:01:36.958]  Going back to Roger Stone.
[01:01:36.998 --> 01:01:38.839]  Roger, let's play some of this CBS piece.
[01:01:39.179 --> 01:01:40.579]  Again, I could go over this for an hour.
[01:01:40.619 --> 01:01:41.979]  I could teach a college course on this.
[01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:50.321]  But just like Megyn Kelly edited tape of me talking about Hillary having people killed in Iraq, then they edited it to say kids in a pizza place on Fox News before she left.
[01:01:50.881 --> 01:01:53.062]  You can hear the women saying, no, he didn't say the N-word.
[01:01:53.402 --> 01:01:58.463]  And this is the famous debate when they were saying there was a rumored N-word on the grabber by the you-know-what tape.
[01:01:58.823 --> 01:02:01.164]  So they're then wargaming that and Amorosa
[01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:09.373]  Day one, he's like jumping in on the phone trying to say it's a lie when she's acting like she's Trump's friend before she even gets hired once he gets elected.
[01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:13.517]  This whole thing, like you said, she's been brought in by one of these top Democrats.
[01:02:13.878 --> 01:02:19.544]  I mean, my God, I wish Trump would have listened to you because I know before he even hired her at the White House, you told him don't do it.
[01:02:20.396 --> 01:02:21.697]  That is correct.
[01:02:21.757 --> 01:02:24.058]  I think she's been a quisling from the beginning.
[01:02:24.099 --> 01:02:29.482]  It's all about her, the aggrandizement of her, the accumulation of power by her.
[01:02:29.922 --> 01:02:32.484]  She's never shared the president's agenda.
[01:02:32.844 --> 01:02:35.306]  What she did in Haiti is disgraceful.
[01:02:35.406 --> 01:02:40.189]  During the campaign, the president pledged to be a friend to the Haitian people.
[01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:46.874]  The Bushes and the Clintons ripped off millions of dollars of the Haitian earthquake money, as we now know.
[01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:50.116]  Amorosa essentially helped perpetuate that.
[01:02:50.596 --> 01:02:57.686]  So she did no favors for this country or this administration, and frankly, I was delighted to see General Kelly tan her.
[01:02:57.707 --> 01:02:58.688]  It was about time.
[01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.493]  Let's go ahead and roll the heavily edited tape.
[01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:04.376]  And even the edited tape, you can hear them stretching.
[01:03:04.396 --> 01:03:04.676]  Here it is.
[01:03:05.771 --> 01:03:21.318]  She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynne Patton, then assistant to Eric Trump, spokesperson Katrina Pearson, and campaign communications director Jason Miller, in which they discuss how to deal with the potential fallout from its release.
[01:03:21.338 --> 01:03:28.062]  I'm trying to find out at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure
[01:03:31.066 --> 01:03:36.210]  Patton then described a conversation she had with then-candidate Trump about making the slur.
[01:03:36.231 --> 01:03:41.014]  I said, well, sir, can you think of any time that this might have happened?
[01:03:41.054 --> 01:03:41.895]  And he said, no.
[01:03:42.155 --> 01:03:43.416]  Well, that's not true.
[01:03:43.456 --> 01:03:46.139]  So... He goes, how do you think I should handle it?
[01:03:46.619 --> 01:03:52.884]  And I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa, which is, well, it depends on what scenario you're talking about.
[01:03:53.745 --> 01:03:56.247]  And he said, well, why don't you just go ahead and put it to bed?
[01:04:00.614 --> 01:04:06.037]  Pearson denied the call ever took place during an interview on Fox News Monday night.
[01:04:06.057 --> 01:04:08.599]  Katrina Kirsten said he said it.
[01:04:09.339 --> 01:04:09.959]  Did that happen?
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.500]  No, Ed.
[01:04:12.021 --> 01:04:13.101]  That did not happen.
[01:04:13.121 --> 01:04:15.342]  It sounds like she's writing a script for a movie.
[01:04:16.724 --> 01:04:23.092]  The White House and Trump campaign have not provided a response to this new development and neither have Pearson or Patton.
[01:04:23.112 --> 01:04:28.900]  We're going to come back in five more minutes with Roger Stone and Joel Skousen joins us on the big geopolitical front.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.923]  What could the big surprise coming up the midterms be?
[01:04:31.944 --> 01:04:33.705]  You hear that hammered, edited tape.
[01:04:34.145 --> 01:04:35.986]  You hear the woman say, no, he didn't say it.
[01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:38.107]  Somebody jumps in and says he does.
[01:04:38.187 --> 01:04:38.887]  And it's October 2016.
[01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:44.010]  They admit they're discussing what could be on the NBC grab-em-by-the-you-know-what tape.
[01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:46.651]  And it was all rumored at the time that was in there.
[01:04:46.911 --> 01:04:49.732]  So they're wargaming all angles and arguing about this.
[01:04:50.232 --> 01:04:50.993]  Hysterical.
[01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:52.253]  Clocking around.
[01:04:52.834 --> 01:04:54.715]  And that becomes the proof of this.
[01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:55.715]  Unbelievable.
[01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:57.976]  We'll put bookends on this straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[01:04:58.016 --> 01:04:59.197]  Then, Joel Skousen.
[01:04:59.257 --> 01:04:59.657]  Stay with us.
[01:05:00.854 --> 01:05:04.537]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:05:04.677 --> 01:05:09.741]  Well, now, you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[01:05:09.921 --> 01:05:11.082]  And here's the best part.
[01:05:11.222 --> 01:05:12.843]  It is absolutely free.
[01:05:13.063 --> 01:05:18.027]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[01:05:18.267 --> 01:05:21.909]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:26.133]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[01:05:26.353 --> 01:05:30.476]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:30.896 --> 01:05:37.301]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[01:05:37.381 --> 01:05:44.187]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:59.740]  $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[01:06:03.803 --> 01:06:05.949]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:11.604]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:33.329]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and let me tell you, people ask me, how are you doing being demonized in thousands of articles, every news channel being lied about?
[01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:43.560]  Well, this is a war to take back the country, and this is what I expected would happen to the people at the turning point, but I didn't know I'd be right at the tip of the spear here.
[01:06:44.341 --> 01:06:47.645]  So we're gonna be wargaming all this geopolitical and more with Joel Skousen.
[01:06:48.686 --> 01:06:50.929]  World Affairs Brief coming up here in about five minutes.
[01:06:50.989 --> 01:06:53.572]  But I wanted to finish up with Roger Stone, former head of the campaign.
[01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:58.497]  You're gonna be coming to Austin tomorrow.
[01:06:59.258 --> 01:07:10.304]  And we're going to spend a few days, and I know you have not wanted to ever break any confidence with the president you've known for 40 plus years, and who you were, even the New York Times admitted 20 years ago, were his wingman for decades.
[01:07:10.664 --> 01:07:17.448]  When he was not married, you guys would go out and date ladies together.
[01:07:18.048 --> 01:07:20.750]  And I didn't just get a lot of this from you.
[01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:28.354]  I read about it in the New York Times back when they were more accurate years ago, because I was trying to figure out who Trump really was about four or five years ago when all this started, or four years ago.
[01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:29.890]  Yes.
[01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:45.471]  I don't
[01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:13.839]  So you agree this is their attempt to double the number of black Americans and Hispanics saying they're going to vote for Republicans in the midterm, turning around, really liking Trump, getting it's all a big lie.
[01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:14.860]  This is the counter.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:22.204]  This is their play amongst others to try to make sure that the Republicans lose this critical midterm election.
[01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.125]  There's no question.
[01:08:24.205 --> 01:08:28.768]  Look, the declarations by Kanye West have had a devastating effect on them.
[01:08:29.452 --> 01:08:34.073]  So this is, in the pop culture, this is an attempt to undo that.
[01:08:34.654 --> 01:08:45.257]  Record number of African Americans now moving towards the Trump position, moving towards the Republican Party, which of course is logical because we are the party of emancipation.
[01:08:45.597 --> 01:08:47.497]  We are the party of civil rights.
[01:08:47.797 --> 01:08:49.578]  We are the party of Lincoln.
[01:08:50.278 --> 01:08:55.800]  Uh, and therefore they're hysterical about it because a small shift in that vote can make the difference.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.341]  Let's look at the 2016 elections.
[01:08:58.781 --> 01:09:03.302]  A shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Detroit gives Donald Trump Michigan.
[01:09:03.842 --> 01:09:09.064]  A shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Milwaukee gives Trump Wisconsin.
[01:09:09.684 --> 01:09:20.089]  A shift of 10,000 votes in the city of Philadelphia gives Trump Pennsylvania, places where Mitt Romney and John McCain fell short.
[01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:27.332]  So they are petrified that Trump is changing the political zeitgeist.
[01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:30.454]  He's changing and forging a new coalition.
[01:09:30.874 --> 01:09:32.935]  Hopefully a permanent coalition.
[01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.055]  So what do we do?
[01:09:34.475 --> 01:09:43.719]  We trot out Omarosa and her pack of lies and her pack of fabrications where she consistently contradicts everything she said previously.
[01:09:44.139 --> 01:09:47.600]  This is so transparent, Alex, it's almost nauseating.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.881]  I don't think the American people will buy it.
[01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:50.802]  I'll tell you why.
[01:09:51.342 --> 01:09:59.945]  Jobs in our inner cities, jobs in our black community, opportunities are far more important than anything Omarosa has to say.
[01:10:00.665 --> 01:10:04.686]  And especially black Americans know they were totally abandoned by Obama.
[01:10:04.726 --> 01:10:06.627]  Their unemployment almost doubled under Obama.
[01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:07.347]  It was just hellish.
[01:10:07.367 --> 01:10:09.347]  He just thought he had them, so he threw them to the curb.
[01:10:09.407 --> 01:10:14.068]  Trump has really been focusing on this, really trying to get factories in, and folks know that, so it's very exciting.
[01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:15.649]  Let me just add this point.
[01:10:15.669 --> 01:10:17.309]  They're really trying to take us down.
[01:10:17.349 --> 01:10:23.691]  We've had NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and EuropeWars all targeted because they're not on the biggest servers.
[01:10:24.491 --> 01:10:25.212]  They're on huge ones.
[01:10:25.632 --> 01:10:30.915]  InfoWars is on really fancy, high-tech systems with systems in front of it, you name it.
[01:10:31.656 --> 01:10:33.777]  But it's been going down since this weekend intermittently.
[01:10:34.117 --> 01:10:39.300]  InfoWars.com is now down and under attack.
[01:10:39.941 --> 01:10:43.943]  And we've had people inside companies, you tell us, oh, your software, you can't use it now.
[01:10:43.963 --> 01:10:45.664]  And then we contact the head of the companies.
[01:10:45.684 --> 01:10:46.545]  I'm not going to say names.
[01:10:47.425 --> 01:10:49.026]  It's not Cloudflare that's doing this.
[01:10:49.947 --> 01:10:51.968]  And they say, no, that's a mutiny inside our operation.
[01:10:51.988 --> 01:10:52.389]  They say, well,
[01:10:53.129 --> 01:10:54.990]  Basically, someone did that who's unauthorized.
[01:10:56.371 --> 01:11:04.274]  Show, and I want to be clear, it's not CloudFlare, it's a software company, one of the top ones everybody knows the name of, that had that happen over the weekend.
[01:11:04.554 --> 01:11:09.757]  And they didn't ask me not to say their name, I'm just trying to, you know, have some privacy here.
[01:11:09.777 --> 01:11:13.498]  But they're not trying to take us off our payment systems, they've actually taken one down and one...
[01:11:14.699 --> 01:11:15.459]  Chopping cart down.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.361]  They are taking our comment section away.
[01:11:18.381 --> 01:11:20.482]  We had to put a new one in that isn't as popular yet.
[01:11:20.923 --> 01:11:22.023]  Discuss has got rid of us.
[01:11:22.884 --> 01:11:24.265]  Mail chimps, we couldn't send emails to you.
[01:11:24.325 --> 01:11:25.125]  Now we're on a new system.
[01:11:25.145 --> 01:11:25.885]  They're attacking that.
[01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:27.767]  It is total.
[01:11:27.807 --> 01:11:32.129]  They've got three New York Times reporters down here basically full-time following me around and others.
[01:11:32.429 --> 01:11:34.390]  Washington Post writers, BuzzFeed people.
[01:11:34.811 --> 01:11:36.351]  I mean it is, I'm followed around everywhere.
[01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:37.892]  This is a total war.
[01:11:37.932 --> 01:11:39.393]  The Chi-Coms are involved in all of it.
[01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:40.454]  It is insane.
[01:11:40.894 --> 01:11:51.525]  So we'll keep watching InfoWars.com, but if it's down, and if that persists, it was down about an hour this weekend, I didn't make a big deal about it, Gateway Pundit did and we appreciate that, but it is going on.
[01:11:51.545 --> 01:11:52.285]  This is malicious.
[01:11:53.406 --> 01:11:55.689]  You have NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, but
[01:11:56.789 --> 01:11:58.190]  This is our total deplatforming.
[01:11:58.410 --> 01:11:59.671]  This is China involved.
[01:11:59.691 --> 01:12:13.080]  The Washington Times is reporting with one of the national security consultants to Fox News, contributors, saying that they concur that the Chinese are involved with Tim Cook, who's officially moved there, and that they're making their move right now in Hollywood, everywhere.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:17.403]  So we'll be discussing that with Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com, Editor-in-Chief there in just a moment.
[01:12:17.723 --> 01:12:18.984]  You're going to be here in studio.
[01:12:19.024 --> 01:12:20.025]  People need to support you.
[01:12:20.305 --> 01:12:21.846]  Get your book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:12:21.886 --> 01:12:22.427]  That's still up.
[01:12:28.552 --> 01:12:29.452]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:12:29.873 --> 01:12:35.417]  As I think anybody who's watching TV, CNN or Fox knows, Robert Mueller has me in his sights.
[01:12:35.897 --> 01:12:37.579]  Not that I've committed any crime.
[01:12:37.659 --> 01:12:41.622]  My crime is supporting Donald Trump for president and being effective about it.
[01:12:41.702 --> 01:12:44.685]  But my legal bills are through the sky.
[01:12:44.705 --> 01:12:46.666]  They threaten to destroy me.
[01:12:46.706 --> 01:12:50.609]  So folks can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:52.411]  StoneDefenseFund.com
[01:12:53.111 --> 01:12:59.839]  Uh, like InfoWars and my family members there, we are under siege and we need help as never before.
[01:12:59.979 --> 01:13:05.445]  So, if you go to StoneDefenseFund.com, anything you can send would be a godsend.
[01:13:05.465 --> 01:13:07.347]  Alright, and we thank all the listeners and viewers.
[01:13:07.367 --> 01:13:08.648]  And again, if you're a TV viewer, look at this.
[01:13:08.668 --> 01:13:09.128]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:13:09.148 --> 01:13:10.009]  You'll be in studio tomorrow.
[01:13:11.030 --> 01:13:11.331]  Yes, indeed.
[01:13:11.351 --> 01:13:12.011]  We're doing.
[01:13:12.031 --> 01:13:13.093]  Pardon me, sir?
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:17.941]  I think your audio is going up and down.
[01:13:17.981 --> 01:13:18.261]  Thank you.
[01:13:18.281 --> 01:13:18.942]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:13:19.903 --> 01:13:24.867]  Senate Democrats are circulating plans for government takeover of the Internet.
[01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:27.089]  This is just from last week, Reason Magazine.
[01:13:27.109 --> 01:13:27.469]  Then look!
[01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:28.210]  Boom!
[01:13:29.091 --> 01:13:29.931]  Infowars is down.
[01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.513]  This is concerted.
[01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:34.916]  Turns out Senator Warner is running it all.
[01:13:35.256 --> 01:13:44.384]  Senator Mark Warner proposes the end of free speech to bring an EU-style social score with the Chinese and fine you if the bureaucrats say you're fake news.
[01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:58.443]  We're taking off Vimeo video platform they said because we claimed that Muslim training camps have been busted that were reportedly and allegedly in the indictments saying that they were planning to carry out school shootings.
[01:13:59.303 --> 01:14:12.767]  They found a dead body of a child who'd been reported missing from another state reportedly killed in a ritual and they let him go on $20,000 bond that's $2,000 and the judge says she's gonna waive that even because they said it's racist
[01:14:13.666 --> 01:14:20.548]  Because they're black and if they were Christians in a compound like that, they would never have had their children taken.
[01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:24.570]  They got emergency calls, people starving to death on the compound.
[01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:25.270]  It has tunnels.
[01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:26.810]  It looks like hell on earth.
[01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:30.672]  They were out there, reportedly, people that called it in said this was going on.
[01:14:30.852 --> 01:14:42.836]  But the point is, if they found a dead body in my nice five-bedroom house of a dead kid, I guarantee you that I'd still be in jail a week later, ladies and gentlemen, if Alex Jones was found with a dead kid
[01:14:44.144 --> 01:14:48.478]  Was found missing months ago from another state, who reportedly died in a ritual.
[01:14:48.738 --> 01:14:50.664]  Do you think I'd be out of jail right now?
[01:14:50.684 --> 01:14:50.725]  No!
[01:14:52.728 --> 01:14:54.049]  Firebombings all over Sweden.
[01:14:54.149 --> 01:14:55.049]  Firebombings in France.
[01:14:55.089 --> 01:14:56.089]  They're not even hardly reporting it.
[01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:57.830]  Another Westminster truck attack.
[01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:58.450]  Four injured.
[01:14:59.271 --> 01:15:00.151]  All of this going on.
[01:15:00.271 --> 01:15:03.692]  Building, building, building, building to the chaos to remove Trump.
[01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:10.695]  Building, building, building with the Antifa attacking people and running around saying they're going to kill Trump outside the White House and NBC and CNN covering it up.
[01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:15.097]  We'll talk all about it with Joel Skousen of WorldAffairsBrief.com on the other side.
[01:15:15.137 --> 01:15:16.738]  And remember, no matter what they do to InfoWars,
[01:15:17.338 --> 01:15:28.907]  There's still Daily Caller, and there's still Drudge Report, and there's still worldaffairsbrief.com, and there's still, you know, all the other great people and organizations out there that let the truth get out, like George Norrie and others.
[01:15:29.507 --> 01:15:33.190]  But I'm telling you, we have been chosen for destruction, and then you are next.
[01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:41.317]  Because they've tracked back to us the catalyst with all these guests, and everybody that's info wars, you the audience, I'm just one part of it.
[01:15:42.443 --> 01:15:43.844]  Literally, sometimes the problem in it.
[01:15:44.445 --> 01:15:45.446]  But that's the way God works.
[01:15:45.566 --> 01:15:48.529]  And we are changing the world and populism and nationalism is exploding.
[01:15:48.769 --> 01:15:50.731]  But the chi-coms are breathing down my neck.
[01:15:51.111 --> 01:15:54.174]  They are breathing down my neck and InfoWars is down as we speak.
[01:15:54.614 --> 01:15:55.956]  NewsWars.com is still up.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.322]  Remember the old days of the internet?
[01:16:03.303 --> 01:16:06.526]  When we communicated with each other directly email to email?
[01:16:07.873 --> 01:16:08.713]  You've got mail.
[01:16:09.293 --> 01:16:11.934]  But then Google came along and said, we've got Gmail.
[01:16:12.014 --> 01:16:12.815]  Why, it's free.
[01:16:12.915 --> 01:16:15.235]  But, of course, we read what you say and what you do.
[01:16:16.036 --> 01:16:21.897]  And then now, more and more, these big globalist companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Google, if they don't like you, they simply ban you.
[01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:26.979]  And, of course, if you're a conservative, they just list you as a Nazi.
[01:16:27.279 --> 01:16:29.560]  That's right, the entire Republican Party of California.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:35.402]  Ladies and gentlemen, these platforms were useful for us to reach each other while they were still somewhat open and free.
[01:16:36.082 --> 01:16:39.584]  But the big monopoly companies only did this to consolidate the market.
[01:16:40.044 --> 01:16:45.146]  Now they're using that monopoly power, like all monopolies do, to abuse the general public.
[01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:54.097]  That's why it's more important than ever that you visit NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com themselves so the globalists can't censor you as easily.
[01:16:54.257 --> 01:16:55.779]  But just as important is email.
[01:16:56.199 --> 01:16:57.841]  We need to be able to talk to you directly.
[01:16:58.182 --> 01:17:04.009]  That's why it's critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for a free newsletter.
[01:17:04.469 --> 01:17:10.571]  Also, under every article at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, you can see the little sign-up box.
[01:17:10.831 --> 01:17:11.691]  It's absolutely free.
[01:17:12.151 --> 01:17:19.394]  And that way, no matter what happens, we can send you articles, videos, special coupon codes for the shopping cart, you name it.
[01:17:19.934 --> 01:17:27.436]  It is now absolutely essential, according to all the internet experts I talk to, that everybody start going back more and more.
[01:17:27.816 --> 01:17:27.976]  to
[01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:52.650]  Sure.
[01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:22.671]  We're good to go.
[01:18:37.056 --> 01:18:39.298]  We're all pulling for the same mission.
[01:18:39.498 --> 01:18:46.303]  Americana, lower taxes, Second Amendment, religious freedom, family values, and it's happening.
[01:18:46.643 --> 01:18:54.929]  But we aren't able to communicate with each other person to person, peer to peer, on these platforms like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google, all of it.
[01:18:54.949 --> 01:18:56.670]  More and more that's being censored.
[01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.752]  The shadow bands have gone to outright bands.
[01:18:59.873 --> 01:19:02.215]  And yes, we're going to try to reform these institutions.
[01:19:02.235 --> 01:19:03.196]  We're going to try to break them up.
[01:19:03.396 --> 01:19:06.299]  That's the whole process starting with congressional hearings in Congress right now.
[01:19:06.639 --> 01:19:20.491]  But during this long, hard battle, it's more important than ever that patrons, Christians, nationalists, people that are populist, not just here in the U.S., but all over the world, be able to communicate with each other and realize the importance of email.
[01:19:21.412 --> 01:19:26.376]  I personally get sick of email and how it gets full of spam, especially with my older email addresses.
[01:19:26.877 --> 01:19:32.401]  That's why, with Friends and Family, I have private email that only Friends and Family have.
[01:19:33.422 --> 01:19:43.950]  I again suggest that everybody go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can send you direct videos, direct articles, and bypass the system.
[01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:50.596]  And yes, send you special coupon codes and other deals that are the very best we offer from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:51.156 --> 01:19:53.720]  Again, my friends, thank you for joining us in the InfoWar.
[01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.982]  We're winning thanks to you.
[01:19:55.042 --> 01:19:59.568]  God bless.
[01:20:03.574 --> 01:20:06.197]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.486 --> 01:20:31.770]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:46.659]  Well, Joel Skousen and his family, and patriots of the FBI like his uncle Cleon Skousen, were the first to expose how big, rich robber barons were funding communism, helping put communist China in place, all of it.
[01:20:46.679 --> 01:20:49.161]  It was John Birch who got tortured to death.
[01:20:50.314 --> 01:20:55.816]  At the end of World War II, when Mao was taking power in the late 40s, because he knew that our government was aiding it.
[01:20:56.416 --> 01:21:08.320]  And so it's folks like Joel Skousen, best-selling author, former Marine Corps naval aviator in the Vietnam era, Patriot editor-in-chief of WorldAffairsBrief.com, can really speak to this.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:10.681]  But the Washington Times has a big article.
[01:21:10.701 --> 01:21:15.322]  And by the way, I've been told, leave the Islamists alone, leave China alone, you're gonna be taking off these platforms.
[01:21:15.982 --> 01:21:17.643]  And Tim Cook's officially moved to China.
[01:21:19.094 --> 01:21:22.995]  Google has been caught building secret censorship systems that they're already testing here.
[01:21:23.135 --> 01:21:23.536]  It's here.
[01:21:24.516 --> 01:21:25.316]  And here's the article.
[01:21:25.416 --> 01:21:26.256]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:21:26.336 --> 01:21:28.637]  China is the threat and it may be too late.
[01:21:29.017 --> 01:21:30.538]  That's L. Todd Wood.
[01:21:30.998 --> 01:21:34.999]  He's a national security advisor and expert contributor to Fox News and a bunch of other groups.
[01:21:35.499 --> 01:21:37.920]  And he breaks it all down there as well.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:38.660]  Must read.
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:41.381]  China literally owns most of Hollywood now.
[01:21:42.382 --> 01:21:43.622]  Two years ago, three years ago,
[01:21:46.877 --> 01:21:54.445]  Michael Savage, they printed a couple, like 50,000 of his book, he said, and then they wouldn't put it in stores because the Chinese said no.
[01:21:55.326 --> 01:21:56.927]  So this is the big enchilada.
[01:21:57.588 --> 01:22:03.234]  And I'm not saying China totally runs the U.S., but the globalists have been merging with it and still planning to fight with it.
[01:22:03.274 --> 01:22:04.555]  I agree with what Skousen says.
[01:22:06.443 --> 01:22:10.004]  It seems to me though that the Chinese are going into overdrive right now.
[01:22:10.304 --> 01:22:17.506]  I'm going to get his expert take on this and what he thinks about Infowars.com being down right now and the total deplatforming we're facing.
[01:22:17.826 --> 01:22:19.167]  What does that signify?
[01:22:19.187 --> 01:22:22.428]  Because they're already going after everybody else right now ahead of the midterms.
[01:22:22.588 --> 01:22:28.570]  I think they wouldn't be doing something this illegal, we've talked to top lawyers, and draconian if they weren't planning to go for broke.
[01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:30.010]  Joel Skousen, thanks for joining us.
[01:22:33.251 --> 01:22:35.612]  Well, the issue is conspiracy, Alex.
[01:22:35.692 --> 01:22:47.340]  You mentioned there are other people, Infowars goes down, there's Breitbart, there's Dredgen, but they don't cover conspiracy in the degree with argumentation and evidence that you do.
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.220]  Now, I do.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:54.784]  I've got a much smaller audience than either, but you are the kingpin of the conspiracy movement, like it or not.
[01:22:54.984 --> 01:22:56.885]  And that's why you're the target, Alex.
[01:22:57.966 --> 01:23:01.248]  And it's a test one taking, which I don't think they will be.
[01:23:02.302 --> 01:23:05.545]  Uh, this has got to be, uh, you know, very disconcerting.
[01:23:05.625 --> 01:23:10.248]  It's got to be a problem, you know, financially, as they continue to harass you with these lawsuits.
[01:23:10.908 --> 01:23:16.853]  I can tell you that people on the outside say, hey, something's wrong with this picture.
[01:23:18.524 --> 01:23:23.306]  There is a vendetta against this guy and I better find out what's going on here.
[01:23:23.366 --> 01:23:36.974]  And so I think people are showing interest in finding out a little bit about you and they find out, you know, that you have made corrections to the things which they always promote in a false way that you've said about Sandy Hook or other things or the Pizzagate thing.
[01:23:37.314 --> 01:23:39.175]  They never talk about your corrections.
[01:23:39.195 --> 01:23:43.077]  They never talk about your improved position on these things.
[01:23:43.237 --> 01:23:46.058]  So this is a very strange piece of bias.
[01:23:46.919 --> 01:23:47.819]  It's not going to end.
[01:23:48.619 --> 01:23:49.940]  This is a powerful system.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:24:06.766]  One of my major complaints is the conservative movement keeps saying, and a lot of this is due to Fox News, who talks about the deep state, but in their opinion the deep state is simply Obama administration Democrat holdovers in the bureaucracies which are out to get Trump.
[01:24:06.806 --> 01:24:08.367]  That's not the deep state at all.
[01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:17.546]  The Deep State is a long centuries old conspiracy of power, which is satanic based, revelatory based.
[01:24:17.586 --> 01:24:20.207]  That's why it keeps going generation after generation.
[01:24:20.947 --> 01:24:22.548]  It isn't one person that runs it.
[01:24:22.608 --> 01:24:24.968]  When Brzezinski dies, there's Kissinger.
[01:24:25.028 --> 01:24:27.709]  And when Kissinger dies, there's going to be somebody else.
[01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:28.849]  It's a spirit.
[01:24:28.909 --> 01:24:30.990]  It's empowered by a spirit of wanting to hurt people.
[01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:32.691]  And as you've said this for years, you're absolutely right.
[01:24:32.911 --> 01:24:34.791]  Look at how the Koch brothers are now against Trump.
[01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:37.772]  And again, Trump's not perfect, but why do they hate him so much?
[01:24:41.488 --> 01:24:42.669]  Well, it's hard to say.
[01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:51.095]  You know, I was very cautiously optimistic when Trump was was elected because of his powerful campaign positions.
[01:24:51.155 --> 01:24:55.999]  I thought, boy, if even half of those come true, it's going to be a real win for us.
[01:24:56.159 --> 01:24:59.761]  And unfortunately, less than 10 percent have come true.
[01:25:00.142 --> 01:25:07.127]  And the major compromises, especially in foreign policy, has been a real disaster.
[01:25:07.507 --> 01:25:08.688]  The attacks on Syria,
[01:25:09.068 --> 01:25:11.610]  Certainly that's the case, but then why is he so embattled?
[01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:16.113]  Why are they so frothing and demonically energized to take him out?
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.000]  Because it has slowed down their agenda.
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:44.022]  You know, Donald Trump, they convince him of one thing and the next day he turns around and they have to re-convince him.
[01:25:44.102 --> 01:25:47.362]  In other words, they never get ahead with Donald Trump.
[01:25:48.242 --> 01:25:48.983]  It's the same thing.
[01:25:49.003 --> 01:25:57.604]  They can stop him from pursuing his agenda in favor of liberty, and they do so, but he keeps coming back around and tries again and they have to stop him again.
[01:25:57.624 --> 01:26:00.385]  I mean, this guy is not an insider.
[01:26:00.965 --> 01:26:03.026]  He is very much a flawed person.
[01:26:03.286 --> 01:26:12.288]  He's got good instincts, but his weaknesses and his lack of background, his lack of understanding of the facts on how the deep state operates.
[01:26:12.348 --> 01:26:13.429]  Who's in the deep state?
[01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:19.131]  What are the deep state operations like the supporting and the creation of ISIS and Al Qaeda?
[01:26:19.171 --> 01:26:20.471]  He knows nothing about those.
[01:26:21.078 --> 01:26:29.921]  So when they give him these false excuses, explaining away his instincts, he doesn't have the wherewithal to counter those very sophisticated arguments.
[01:26:30.041 --> 01:26:30.181]  Sure.
[01:26:30.201 --> 01:26:30.781]  Let me ask you this.
[01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:32.182]  I don't mean to distract off into Trump.
[01:26:32.782 --> 01:26:38.044]  With the, and I know InfoWars is important, but they're using the crackdown on me as a precedent.
[01:26:38.084 --> 01:26:40.504]  They're cracking down on so many people now ahead of the midterms.
[01:26:41.005 --> 01:26:44.706]  What is Congress going to do about this when you have top Democrats, Murphy,
[01:26:45.686 --> 01:26:50.271]  And others saying, we're going to end the First Amendment in official announcements.
[01:26:50.351 --> 01:26:53.394]  I mean, this is, this is just crazy.
[01:26:54.134 --> 01:26:58.078]  These statements, Senate Democrats circulating plans for government, take over the internet.
[01:26:58.378 --> 01:27:00.420]  Senator Mark Warner proposes end of free speech.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.702]  I mean, they're really doing this.
[01:27:03.416 --> 01:27:07.700]  Well, they are, and that's why it's important to really address the arguments that they're using.
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:16.867]  I do so in this week's World Affairs Brief, which people can get a free copy of by simply emailing me at editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:27:17.228 --> 01:27:21.952]  My top story this week is about the vendetta against Alex Jones and why it's unjust.
[01:27:22.452 --> 01:27:24.734]  First of all, they're basing this on hate speech.
[01:27:25.334 --> 01:27:30.719]  Hate speech can never be a legal basis for anything because it's undefinable.
[01:27:31.269 --> 01:27:35.612]  Now, you can get to a definable level when you talk about incitement to violence.
[01:27:35.992 --> 01:27:37.633]  And we do that in our courts of law.
[01:27:37.673 --> 01:27:42.096]  You can't sit there and rally people to kill someone and get away with it.
[01:27:42.136 --> 01:27:43.697]  Like the Democrats do everywhere.
[01:27:45.158 --> 01:27:45.779]  Well, that's right.
[01:27:45.899 --> 01:27:47.480]  And they even talk about killing Trump.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:52.443]  But the point is, the normal person can't get away with that incitement of violence.
[01:27:52.483 --> 01:27:57.607]  But you can't take hate... Hate speech is nothing more than strong criticism of another person.
[01:27:58.237 --> 01:28:00.118]  Now, I know you have been critical of Muslims.
[01:28:00.298 --> 01:28:01.419]  I have been critical of Muslims.
[01:28:01.459 --> 01:28:11.444]  You've been critical of... I have been about blacks and the work ethic or the unwed mother problem within that category.
[01:28:11.504 --> 01:28:13.986]  But we're doing that trying to help people, not because we hate them.
[01:28:15.441 --> 01:28:15.961]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:16.002 --> 01:28:24.729]  And we're also doing it to be able to stop or counter the left or the mainstream media attempt to cover up the problems within the community.
[01:28:24.849 --> 01:28:26.271]  I mean, you played it.
[01:28:27.091 --> 01:28:34.498]  I heard in Fox News talking about the problem with black unemployment as if this is something that's systemic to the capitalist system.
[01:28:35.058 --> 01:28:51.731]  But when you look at the problems within the black homes within the nation, and the lack of work ethic and things, and the unwed mother problem, and the gang and the other things that hits the Latinos well, that's the basis for... Which is a product of the Great Society, which was a plan.
[01:28:51.992 --> 01:28:55.234]  We'll be back with Joel Skousen about what could the big events be ahead of the midterms.
[01:28:55.494 --> 01:28:56.936]  What does he expect into the future?
[01:28:57.196 --> 01:28:58.397]  InfoWars, by the way, is down.
[01:28:59.488 --> 01:28:59.688]  If you

[01:29:36.616 --> 01:29:38.358]  It's one of the very best heart pills out there.
[01:29:38.678 --> 01:29:39.459]  It's XtendoWise.

[01:29:45.865 --> 01:29:51.230]  It's very, very pure, very, very clean and has the EPA type that is specifically good for the heart, cardiovascular system.
[01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:55.394]  It's got the properly formulated type of CoQ10 and more.
[01:29:55.734 --> 01:29:57.296]  It is XtendoWise.
[01:29:57.336 --> 01:29:59.498]  Now available at m4warslife.com.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.461]  We're at Whole Paycheck.
[01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:10.163]  Or now, not at Whole Foods, but Amazon Foods.
[01:30:10.483 --> 01:30:13.084]  You know Jeff Bezos owns this now, right?
[01:30:13.124 --> 01:30:14.685]  The guy that owns Amazon, the richest guy in the world?
[01:30:14.985 --> 01:30:17.327]  It's on record that they cut back the amount of organic food here.
[01:30:17.847 --> 01:30:19.268]  It's on record they're cutting back the quality.
[01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:20.448]  Their own employees have complained.
[01:30:20.568 --> 01:30:24.210]  Most of your big top billionaires have got the laws written where they don't pay any taxes.
[01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:25.391]  It's a great product right here.
[01:30:27.247 --> 01:30:28.127]  We're coming out with one similar.
[01:30:28.928 --> 01:30:29.848]  You need magnesium.
[01:30:29.988 --> 01:30:31.089]  You need all this for your body.
[01:30:31.369 --> 01:30:33.530]  They say it's a scam, and I sell it, but not Jeff Bezos.
[01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:39.393]  So, this is the most consumerist thing in the world by a monopoly man who's buying up the whole country.
[01:30:39.693 --> 01:30:40.553]  Made $12 billion in one day.
[01:30:42.894 --> 01:30:43.975]  12 billion himself.
[01:30:43.995 --> 01:30:46.396]  12 b-b-b-b-billion.
[01:30:46.776 --> 01:30:48.317]  This is Bezos' private property.
[01:30:48.757 --> 01:30:49.757]  He doesn't respect ours.
[01:30:49.797 --> 01:30:51.518]  He lobbies to end small family homes.
[01:30:51.999 --> 01:30:54.520]  He wants 250 square foot coffin apartments.
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:30:56.141]  USA Today called for that last week.
[01:30:56.341 --> 01:30:59.362]  He doesn't want you to have any money, but he made 12 billion dollars in one day last week.
[01:30:59.502 --> 01:31:01.083]  But I agree with his property rights.
[01:31:01.343 --> 01:31:04.364]  And I agree with this security officer's point that this is private property.
[01:31:04.605 --> 01:31:05.745]  And that they've asked us to stop filming.
[01:31:05.785 --> 01:31:08.586]  So what we're going to do is, we're going to go wait outside on the property line.
[01:31:08.787 --> 01:31:09.347]  Last morning,
[01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:10.948]  You know, you're in poverty.
[01:31:10.968 --> 01:31:13.249]  Whole Foods doesn't want you on the property.
[01:31:13.269 --> 01:31:14.930]  You can go around the parking lot.
[01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:19.692]  So, if you want to go to the sidewalk right now before you call APD.
[01:31:19.792 --> 01:31:20.452]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:31:20.492 --> 01:31:22.773]  Because you're not following our instructions.
[01:31:22.793 --> 01:31:25.355]  So, if you can go to the sidewalk, that's all.
[01:31:25.375 --> 01:31:26.235]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:31:26.435 --> 01:31:27.676]  I'm trying to be courteous.
[01:31:27.756 --> 01:31:30.057]  I'm trying to be courteous and nice to you.
[01:31:30.097 --> 01:31:30.777]  You're not complying.
[01:31:30.817 --> 01:31:31.577]  I'm being really nice to you.
[01:31:31.618 --> 01:31:33.038]  I need you to go to the sidewalk.
[01:31:33.058 --> 01:31:35.019]  Well, sure I will, but I can't get in my car.
[01:31:35.039 --> 01:31:36.740]  Maybe I can go to the sidewalk, please.
[01:31:37.502 --> 01:31:39.547]  Try it nice like you did too, big man.
[01:31:39.788 --> 01:31:40.370]  Big tough guy.
[01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:41.372]  Ciao.
[01:31:43.098 --> 01:31:51.962]  Jeff Bezos made $12 million in one day last week, ripping you off by owning Whole Foods and lowering the quality.
[01:31:52.002 --> 01:31:58.304]  Jeff Bezos makes $1.50 on every single package he ships out on Amazon to the US Postal Service.
[01:31:59.104 --> 01:32:03.966]  Jeff Bezos is a criminal who is anti-free merchants and anti-America.
[01:32:04.166 --> 01:32:09.589]  And we came out here nicely to cover it, and he had one of his goons get in our face.
[01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:12.890]  So, the little cheetahs in there that think it's funny,
[01:32:13.651 --> 01:32:14.391]  Look at this!
[01:32:14.431 --> 01:32:15.692]  Look at this trending!
[01:32:15.712 --> 01:32:18.254]  Jeff Bezos is your enemy!
[01:32:18.434 --> 01:32:19.575]  Bezos thinks you're schmucks.
[01:32:20.275 --> 01:32:22.957]  He made $12 billion in one day, last week.
[01:32:23.457 --> 01:32:24.818]  Richest guy in the world.
[01:32:25.379 --> 01:32:27.160]  And that jerk, they know my car's parked in there.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.221]  I said, yeah, we're going to stop filming.
[01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:28.841]  I'm going to get in my car.
[01:32:28.861 --> 01:32:30.062]  He said, get off the property.
[01:32:31.175 --> 01:32:32.256]  See how that works in America?
[01:32:32.576 --> 01:32:35.759]  Like, 18 of my products are private-labeled national brands that they private-labeled, too.
[01:32:35.779 --> 01:32:42.844]  We had to come in here and just get in Bezos' face, because, I mean, the leftists in here even told me when I had three kids—I got four now—hey, you got too many kids.
[01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:43.645]  That's the cult.
[01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:50.070]  They got magazines that say sustainable development, you know, being poor is the new chic, austerity's cool.
[01:32:51.031 --> 01:32:52.132]  Bezos isn't austere.
[01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:18.239]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:21.501 --> 01:33:25.664]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:26.345 --> 01:33:27.665]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.747 --> 01:33:29.947]  Okay!
[01:33:31.311 --> 01:33:34.892]  You can study military history, you can study tactics, they have different names for it.
[01:33:35.792 --> 01:33:43.454]  But, take the invasion of Panama, right after George Herbert Walker Bush got into office.
[01:33:44.214 --> 01:33:49.075]  And I'm not saying the Panamanian dictator was a good guy, but he wasn't paying his drug money into the CIA anymore, that's all come out in court.
[01:33:51.435 --> 01:33:54.916]  Now, for six months before they invaded,
[01:33:56.516 --> 01:34:05.608]  They dropped flashbangs, they shot blanks off, helicopters did landings, until when they finally hit, people just thought, oh, it's just more of the attack.
[01:34:05.648 --> 01:34:11.656]  That's a tactic, where you build up the attack until finally the real attack comes, and you don't stand up against it.
[01:34:11.676 --> 01:34:12.558]  There's different names for that.
[01:34:14.485 --> 01:34:16.326]  They're trying to take our credit card processors.
[01:34:16.366 --> 01:34:17.206]  They just took one.
[01:34:17.606 --> 01:34:19.207]  They just took down one of our shopping carts.
[01:34:19.407 --> 01:34:28.910]  They took us off Credio after taking us off AdRoll that advertises with Google where we just sold water filters and air filters and supplements outside to fund this place.
[01:34:29.451 --> 01:34:32.151]  That was four million dollars gross, like two and a half million dollars money.
[01:34:33.532 --> 01:34:34.632]  It takes a lot of money to run this.
[01:34:34.812 --> 01:34:36.073]  That was like all our extra money.
[01:34:36.353 --> 01:34:38.454]  I had to really work hard to get that back to even keep going.
[01:34:38.754 --> 01:34:39.934]  They just blew away Credio.
[01:34:40.174 --> 01:34:41.395]  It was at three million dollars.
[01:34:43.211 --> 01:34:43.952]  Already this year.
[01:34:44.332 --> 01:34:45.873]  It was doing better than the last thing.
[01:34:46.193 --> 01:34:46.534]  Gone.
[01:34:46.594 --> 01:34:47.094]  Blown away.
[01:34:47.134 --> 01:34:48.055]  They sought us out.
[01:34:48.135 --> 01:34:50.377]  They said, our general counsel says we can't work with you for hate.
[01:34:51.878 --> 01:34:58.103]  As Joel Skousen just said, that's a Soviet globalist leftist think tank university term.
[01:34:58.903 --> 01:35:00.704]  Uh, where they just say, oh, it's hate.
[01:35:01.184 --> 01:35:02.185]  We just say that's hate.
[01:35:02.625 --> 01:35:09.849]  They banned us off Vimeo for saying that an Islamic training camp got busted that reportedly, allegedly, was planning mass shootings at schools.
[01:35:09.869 --> 01:35:10.669]  That was mainstream news.
[01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:12.370]  They said, you're gone for that.
[01:35:12.751 --> 01:35:15.012]  They arrest you in Europe if you talk about Islamic terror.
[01:35:16.329 --> 01:35:19.933]  So, it's here folks, and it's all being segued over, and now U.S.
[01:35:19.973 --> 01:35:29.004]  Senators, Democrats are saying, we're going to follow EU rules and Chinese systems, and the Chinese dictator has been in the Wall Street Journal, praising America, going after fake news.
[01:35:29.985 --> 01:35:31.007]  So, we're here.
[01:35:32.248 --> 01:35:33.469]  So, this is the big attack.
[01:35:33.610 --> 01:35:36.273]  InfoWars, we've confirmed, has been artificially hit.
[01:35:38.777 --> 01:35:42.019]  It is down right now, even though we had systems in front of it that couldn't even do it.
[01:35:42.039 --> 01:35:42.860]  It has to be internal.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:46.162]  This is what they said four months ago in Bloomberg, after I was already told this.
[01:35:47.684 --> 01:35:50.886]  People internally at YouTube put fake strikes on us and took us down.
[01:35:51.126 --> 01:35:51.787]  They reversed it.
[01:35:52.207 --> 01:35:54.689]  But they're so sick of rebellions inside Google and Apple.
[01:35:56.584 --> 01:36:03.547]  Google this year refused, their people walked off a US engineering project refusing to work for the Pentagon.
[01:36:03.867 --> 01:36:05.247]  That's how activist they are.
[01:36:05.747 --> 01:36:08.589]  Google's taking Christmas off their calendars along with Apple.
[01:36:09.429 --> 01:36:14.691]  So you have to understand, there aren't even so much Chinese operatives as they just hate the country.
[01:36:15.291 --> 01:36:20.053]  So we'll get Joel Scouser's take on that, but right now, InfoWars.com has been taken down.
[01:36:21.471 --> 01:36:23.391]  Oh, it's just a private company, they can take you down!
[01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:37.835]  No, this is just, so they are exponentially, I believe, beta testing ahead of a big event, civil unrest, assassination of Trump, who knows what the false flag is, a group of false flags, attacks on the media, attacks on Apple, Google saying we sponsored it or something.
[01:36:37.855 --> 01:36:41.355]  I mean, I see that in the crystal ball, the kind of thing they would do politically.
[01:36:41.835 --> 01:36:44.636]  And then they don't want us there to counter it when they make that move.
[01:36:44.696 --> 01:36:48.817]  So, they were hitting us thousands of articles a day until we
[01:36:50.384 --> 01:36:52.205]  We're number one on the app, number one on everything.
[01:36:52.245 --> 01:36:52.865]  It panicked them.
[01:36:53.905 --> 01:36:56.466]  They kind of went quiet in the last few days.
[01:36:56.566 --> 01:37:01.047]  And then now, behind the scenes, they're going after stuff that's clearly torturous interference.
[01:37:01.227 --> 01:37:09.369]  So Joel, I got you on about China and about the midterms and what you think they may pull, but I'm just kind of on us right now because I never really make a big deal about it now.
[01:37:09.389 --> 01:37:12.070]  We're under attack and I've almost gotten kind of calm to it now.
[01:37:12.090 --> 01:37:13.371]  Like, oh, somebody's following me again.
[01:37:13.731 --> 01:37:14.951]  Oh, the New York Times is following me.
[01:37:15.411 --> 01:37:16.291]  Oh, I'm being harassed.
[01:37:16.551 --> 01:37:18.252]  Oh, you know, they're threatening me again.
[01:37:18.852 --> 01:37:21.594]  And I'm kind of getting into this punch-drunk situation.
[01:37:21.614 --> 01:37:30.939]  I mean, I know you're a veteran who dealt with stuff a lot more stressful than what I'm dealing with, landing on aircraft carriers in rough seas, but isn't there almost a problem where it's not like you have courage.
[01:37:31.460 --> 01:37:36.263]  It's that you've been doing it so long, you're not even worried anymore, and you lose that frostiness.
[01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:38.184]  I mean, do you get what I'm trying to get at here?
[01:37:39.827 --> 01:37:40.267]  Well, yes.
[01:37:41.267 --> 01:37:48.689]  The good danger, Alex, is that in the tension of the moment, you're under attack, there's no question about it on all sides.
[01:37:49.349 --> 01:38:01.752]  The best strategy that you can react to is to come through with more calmness than you've ever had before, so that when people come to you, with a lot of people coming to see, what's this Alex Jones all about?
[01:38:01.772 --> 01:38:06.794]  You know, they show the Wildman video clips on CNN.
[01:38:06.954 --> 01:38:08.314]  But when people come to your show,
[01:38:09.114 --> 01:38:14.461]  If you'll show increased calmness, they'll say, OK, this is a false attack.
[01:38:14.541 --> 01:38:17.224]  There's nothing about Alex Jones that I find objectionable.
[01:38:17.784 --> 01:38:24.953]  And I realize it's hard during the heat of the attack to be calm, but that's what I recommend in terms of a strategy to do more good.
[01:38:25.973 --> 01:38:28.834]  No, I totally agree.
[01:38:29.434 --> 01:38:38.076]  And the Lord works in mysterious ways, so my clowning, sometimes out of context, brought part of the audience and broke through, but I think it's time to fully be serious and not joke around anymore.
[01:38:38.096 --> 01:38:38.796]  I think that's good advice.
[01:38:39.076 --> 01:38:46.358]  Describe your calmness when the jet aircraft or the private plane you were flying failed and you survived that miracle crash landing.
[01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:59.599]  Well, yeah, when my engine, you know, didn't respond to the throttle, I'll tell you, the adrenaline starts going and you realize, all right, we got a problem because that back of that carrier deck is coming up in your face.
[01:39:00.119 --> 01:39:01.981]  You know, I was really shocked, Alex, because
[01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:06.006]  It wasn't so much the technique of what to do with the airplane.
[01:39:06.046 --> 01:39:13.268]  I could always pull the handle and eject at some point, but my major concern on the aircraft carrier was, where do I put this thing?
[01:39:13.288 --> 01:39:17.889]  There are people on the deck that are scrambling, and I'm gonna, you know, hit somebody.
[01:39:18.369 --> 01:39:22.610]  Now, when my personal airplane crashed, of course, I thought that I had made the landing.
[01:39:22.710 --> 01:39:25.230]  I was avoiding the populated area.
[01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:26.371]  I was heading for a field.
[01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:31.552]  There just happened to be a fence post there that caught my landing gear and made the aircraft tumble.
[01:39:32.333 --> 01:39:35.276]  And, you know, it was a severe crash.
[01:39:35.396 --> 01:39:39.100]  It broke my 2,000-pound test seatbelt, and I didn't go anywhere.
[01:39:39.701 --> 01:39:40.562]  You think about that.
[01:39:40.622 --> 01:39:43.085]  How do you break your seatbelt and not go flying out?
[01:39:43.665 --> 01:39:46.388]  So I think there was a little bit of miraculous help there.
[01:39:47.089 --> 01:39:54.110]  But, you know, you train, you train so that you are calm, relatively calm in the situation.
[01:39:54.170 --> 01:39:58.891]  You know your procedures, you watch your airspeed, you make sure you don't stall and spin.
[01:39:59.291 --> 01:40:01.331]  That's how most people die in an airplane crash.
[01:40:01.351 --> 01:40:06.412]  They keep trying to extend the glide until they stall and spin and they fall out of the air and kill themselves.
[01:40:06.992 --> 01:40:14.094]  If you come in under control, still flying, unless you're heading for a pack of trees, you're going to generally survive.
[01:40:14.134 --> 01:40:16.074]  You may have some injuries, but you're going to survive.
[01:40:17.372 --> 01:40:19.955]  Well, they said that was amazing that you lived through that, Doug.
[01:40:19.975 --> 01:40:24.899]  Like you said, that powerful seatbelt broke, but you had a little scratch on your head and, like, walked off from it.
[01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:28.803]  Yeah, the whole airplane cracked open.
[01:40:28.823 --> 01:40:29.804]  I was sitting on the wing.
[01:40:29.844 --> 01:40:32.126]  I just stepped off onto the grass and I was fine.
[01:40:32.667 --> 01:40:33.888]  It was truly miraculous.
[01:40:35.029 --> 01:40:38.132]  And, like, what did you just zen out at that moment?
[01:40:38.392 --> 01:40:39.433]  I mean, go back to describing it.
[01:40:39.473 --> 01:40:40.995]  Just suddenly there was no power and what happened?
[01:40:42.631 --> 01:40:47.116]  Well, it turned out that the fuel line had become clogged.
[01:40:47.136 --> 01:40:58.709]  There was no way that I could get any power from the airplane, and I was only a quarter mile from the runway, and I realized I was not going to be able to glide to the runway, and so I had to turn onto the non-populated area to avoid crashing into buildings.
[01:40:58.749 --> 01:41:01.472]  This was very near a very populated area, so...
[01:41:01.732 --> 01:41:09.114]  Nigel Farage, even the French police and others confirmed, they were sabotaging his cars, cutting brake lines, unbolting the bolts on it, that at least three times.
[01:41:09.594 --> 01:41:19.177]  He didn't want to get into it, but I've talked to people that know him well, and they said that they think there was some sabotage with the aircraft that ended up later from the injuries, killing the pilot, took him a few years to die.
[01:41:19.438 --> 01:41:21.318]  Farage walked off, his face all smashed.
[01:41:21.698 --> 01:41:23.759]  But do you ever wonder if somebody put something in your fuel?
[01:41:25.426 --> 01:41:38.742]  Well, we were able to pull the fuel filter apart afterwards and found fiberglass particles in it, which in an experimental aircraft, when they build a tank out of fiberglass, some of that fiberglass over time is going to slough off, and that did apparently.
[01:41:39.103 --> 01:41:43.588]  There's no way that that would be an appropriate way to sabotage because the
[01:41:45.215 --> 01:41:48.117]  It's a natural occurring thing that actually pertained to the airplane.
[01:41:48.157 --> 01:41:51.520]  So I think it was a fault of whoever built the airplane.
[01:41:51.540 --> 01:41:52.601]  I agree.
[01:41:52.641 --> 01:41:55.404]  So they should go to metal, aluminum gas tanks, right?
[01:41:56.885 --> 01:41:57.906]  Well, not necessarily.
[01:41:58.006 --> 01:42:01.129]  I mean, there's something to be said for composite construction.
[01:42:01.149 --> 01:42:06.714]  You just have to flush the things out really good to make sure that all that excess fiberglass gets out before you start flying it.
[01:42:06.934 --> 01:42:07.795]  What are you flying out?
[01:42:09.198 --> 01:42:19.986]  Well, I'm flying a certified aircraft, a Mooney, turbocharged Mooney aircraft, and they're not without their problems too, but so you really have to be careful.
[01:42:20.006 --> 01:42:22.427]  I do a very thorough check of the airplane every time.
[01:42:22.448 --> 01:42:24.109]  But that's my dad's favorite small plane.
[01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:25.650]  He's a pilot, is the Mooney.
[01:42:27.153 --> 01:42:29.234]  Yeah, it's a very, very good cross-country airplane.
[01:42:29.915 --> 01:42:33.276]  But you know, getting back to the world situation, Alex... We'll come back to the world situation.
[01:42:33.296 --> 01:42:37.078]  We'll do it right now, in five minutes, the next hour, at Joel Scowls and WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:42:37.138 --> 01:42:39.760]  Go there and subscribe to it, send them an email, send you a free copy.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.601]  It's really powerful information.
[01:42:41.841 --> 01:42:44.642]  We'll look at the midterms, China, big issues.
[01:42:44.702 --> 01:42:45.643]  InfoWars is down!
[01:42:45.663 --> 01:42:48.965]  I mean, this is happening, ladies and gentlemen, and it's artificial.
[01:42:49.005 --> 01:42:49.745]  We've confirmed that.
[01:42:49.965 --> 01:42:52.587]  They are trying to shut us down ahead of something big.
[01:42:52.887 --> 01:42:53.787]  NewsWars.com.
[01:42:54.067 --> 01:42:55.048]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:55.288 --> 01:42:55.949]  Spread those links.
[01:42:55.989 --> 01:42:56.509]  Don't let them win.
[01:43:01.366 --> 01:43:19.679]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[01:43:19.759 --> 01:43:25.683]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[01:43:26.044 --> 01:43:26.744]  It's a great deal at $39.
[01:43:27.405 --> 01:43:29.106]  Immune wall, beta-glucans,
[01:43:30.647 --> 01:43:31.647]  And so much more.
[01:43:32.168 --> 01:43:33.308]  It is concentrated.
[01:43:33.548 --> 01:43:35.269]  You need to go read what is in here.
[01:43:35.369 --> 01:43:40.972]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[01:43:41.072 --> 01:43:42.273]  A citrus peel blend.
[01:43:42.293 --> 01:43:44.234]  I mean, this is the next level.
[01:43:44.314 --> 01:43:46.695]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[01:43:46.895 --> 01:43:48.156]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[01:43:48.336 --> 01:43:50.137]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[01:43:50.697 --> 01:43:51.298]  Immune Wall.
[01:43:51.418 --> 01:43:52.719]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:52.839 --> 01:43:54.019]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:00.768 --> 01:44:04.933]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[01:44:04.953 --> 01:44:06.074]  We didn't do that.
[01:44:07.771 --> 01:44:11.872]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can get.
[01:44:12.312 --> 01:44:13.973]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[01:44:14.553 --> 01:44:23.075]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[01:44:23.555 --> 01:44:25.256]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[01:44:25.296 --> 01:44:26.396]  Don't you get the big secret?
[01:44:27.076 --> 01:44:29.597]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[01:44:29.637 --> 01:44:30.737]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[01:44:31.517 --> 01:44:34.438]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[01:44:42.518 --> 01:44:49.464]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:44:49.484 --> 01:44:49.704]  It's you!
[01:45:12.466 --> 01:45:14.247]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[01:45:14.667 --> 01:45:23.073]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[01:45:23.413 --> 01:45:27.635]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:45:27.956 --> 01:45:28.916]  You are the info warrior.
[01:45:29.417 --> 01:45:32.939]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.
[01:45:33.619 --> 01:45:45.210]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the census can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:55.180]  They have been using all different forms of bullying to keep libertarians, gun owners, Christians, conservatives, nationalists, populists from communicating with each other and sharing information.
[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:55.880]  I don't
[01:46:15.486 --> 01:46:18.567]  We're following in the footsteps of the forefathers of this country.
[01:46:18.927 --> 01:46:21.008]  We have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:46:21.468 --> 01:46:26.409]  We all have this shared together, no matter what color our skin is or what sex we are or where we came from.
[01:46:26.989 --> 01:46:34.631]  And so now I ask you, more than ever, to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:46:35.132 --> 01:46:41.853]  But the bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:46:42.194 --> 01:46:43.574]  I am the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:43.954 --> 01:46:45.496]  You are the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:45.836 --> 01:46:47.378]  Trump is the resistance to globalism.
[01:46:47.999 --> 01:46:49.720]  And many others are across the world.
[01:46:49.921 --> 01:46:50.681]  We are the future.
[01:46:51.622 --> 01:46:52.543]  We are the renaissance.
[01:46:53.104 --> 01:46:54.385]  And we are winning.
[01:47:03.015 --> 01:47:05.658]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.496 --> 01:47:19.749]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:21.263 --> 01:47:23.425]  Okay, so InfoWars.com has been attacked.
[01:47:23.485 --> 01:47:24.926]  It's been turned off, it looks like.
[01:47:24.946 --> 01:47:27.248]  There's DDoS attacks going on, but we have stuff that blocks that.
[01:47:27.308 --> 01:47:31.871]  It's some type of internal sabotage somewhere, not here, but within the different systems out there.
[01:47:31.891 --> 01:47:39.677]  And that's this new trend of the people in the technology companies who are mainly leftist now, and they just, like Reality Winner, they just do whatever they want.
[01:47:39.717 --> 01:47:43.159]  Joel Skousen, editor-in-chief at WorldAtFirstBrief.com, is our guest.
[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.041]  Talk about bizarre breaking news.
[01:47:46.322 --> 01:47:48.684]  They spent 10-plus days in the prosecution.
[01:47:49.801 --> 01:47:50.601]  Against Manafort.
[01:47:51.161 --> 01:47:53.822]  The defense spent less than one day today.
[01:47:56.042 --> 01:47:57.182]  This is just insane.
[01:47:57.302 --> 01:47:59.203]  And we've got all this other stuff happening.
[01:47:59.583 --> 01:48:02.203]  Joel, just quantifying all of this, you're a smart guy.
[01:48:02.763 --> 01:48:05.144]  Where do you think we are currently ahead of the midterms?
[01:48:05.704 --> 01:48:08.584]  The big ramp up of calls for violence, craziest by the left.
[01:48:08.984 --> 01:48:11.725]  At a gut level, a geopolitical level, what do you expect to happen?
[01:48:13.605 --> 01:48:16.886]  Frankly, Alex, almost nothing before the midterms.
[01:48:17.406 --> 01:48:19.106]  The Democrats have a real problem.
[01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:29.288]  If they unleash Antifa in a series of riots and really social unrest, as people have been predicting, it's going to accrue to the Republicans' favor.
[01:48:30.752 --> 01:48:34.194]  And, you know, there is this radical portion of the Democrats.
[01:48:34.214 --> 01:48:42.538]  The Democrats in the middle really are at a loss because, you know, Hillary Clinton is the one they're secretly planning on trying to run again.
[01:48:42.858 --> 01:48:48.360]  And if the radical left portion of the Democrats ruin that for her, it could be a real problem.
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:55.143]  I do think before the next election for Donald Trump directly, there's going to be a they'll pull the plug a little bit on the stock market.
[01:48:55.163 --> 01:48:57.384]  So you get a 20 or 30 percent reduction.
[01:48:57.424 --> 01:48:58.665]  It'll cause pension.
[01:48:59.505 --> 01:49:01.587]  Uh, companies to go out of business.
[01:49:01.847 --> 01:49:03.429]  Donald Trump will get the blame for that.
[01:49:03.729 --> 01:49:09.034]  They're going to try to deny him the success of the economy issue in this next election.
[01:49:09.094 --> 01:49:16.120]  But in the midterms, almost nothing that they can do is going to favor the Democrats.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:19.483]  Any crisis at all is going to be easily blamed on the Democrats.
[01:49:21.344 --> 01:49:25.788]  I think this campaign, frankly, against you, Alex, is backfiring on them.
[01:49:26.028 --> 01:49:28.490]  I think people can see the unjust.
[01:49:28.530 --> 01:49:29.891]  They can see it's one-sided.
[01:49:30.111 --> 01:49:33.594]  Even people on the left are coming to your defense on the issue of free speech.
[01:49:34.575 --> 01:49:36.778]  No, I agree, but here's the problem.
[01:49:37.178 --> 01:49:49.092]  Instead of just deplatforming off all the big places where I can reach people, which is what they wanted, now they're going after the payment processors, they're shutting the website down, and I agree, it's crazy, and why are they doing it?
[01:49:49.112 --> 01:49:51.475]  Because they're only moving forward.
[01:49:53.687 --> 01:50:03.051]  Well, you know, these are control freaks, a lot of people, and some of these people only know how to attack in a frontal way until it backfires on them.
[01:50:03.311 --> 01:50:12.715]  Now, to be frank, they've tried more subtle ways before, you know, as they started to censor YouTube, they started to cut your advertisers on YouTube, but that didn't work.
[01:50:13.511 --> 01:50:16.313]  And so they're having to take strong, strong action.
[01:50:16.333 --> 01:50:20.636]  Now, you know, this whole issue about we're a private company, so we can do anything.
[01:50:20.957 --> 01:50:23.018]  You know, that's a hypocritical legal position.
[01:50:23.598 --> 01:50:30.503]  How many times has the left told us after civil rights legislation that if you are a company open to the public, you can no longer discriminate.
[01:50:31.104 --> 01:50:32.565]  You are not private anymore.
[01:50:32.605 --> 01:50:33.906]  You are a public company.
[01:50:34.466 --> 01:50:39.490]  And yet they're hiding behind the privacy issue or the public, the private company issue.
[01:50:40.336 --> 01:50:43.539]  And that's why they're not saying we're discriminating against Alex Jones.
[01:50:43.559 --> 01:50:45.241]  We're discriminating against conservatives.
[01:50:45.261 --> 01:50:46.502]  They're calling it racist.
[01:50:46.822 --> 01:50:47.863]  They're calling it hatred.
[01:50:48.344 --> 01:50:49.625]  And these things are untrue.
[01:50:49.885 --> 01:50:51.146]  They're unprovable legally.
[01:50:51.166 --> 01:50:53.909]  And that's why we have to fight against those.
[01:50:54.329 --> 01:51:05.260]  I think that if Trump, as a president, were on the ball, he would go to his FCC and other people and say, all right, we need a rule that basically prohibits people from using
[01:51:05.961 --> 01:51:10.229]  You know, non-judicial legal terms like hate speech in order to ban things.
[01:51:10.269 --> 01:51:13.996]  We've got to protect free speech by making sure they cannot use these.
[01:51:14.825 --> 01:51:26.375]  I am most disappointed by what Trump and his Justice Department under Jeff Sessions has not done to protect us, has not done to uncover and root out the deep state.
[01:51:26.495 --> 01:51:33.741]  I think they probably got something on Jeff Sessions and that's why he's acting as a feckless attorney general.
[01:51:33.761 --> 01:51:37.304]  He simply is not going to bat for Donald Trump or liberty or anything else.
[01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:43.991]  My horse, my horse, my kingdom for a horse.
[01:51:44.031 --> 01:51:46.953]  We got one tweet out that InfoWars is down, but it had a link in it.
[01:51:46.973 --> 01:51:48.134]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:51:48.194 --> 01:51:48.414]  No.
[01:51:49.094 --> 01:51:50.555]  Go to NewsWars.com.
[01:51:51.876 --> 01:51:53.777]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:51:53.817 --> 01:51:55.378]  You can't go to InfoWars.com.
[01:51:55.398 --> 01:51:58.480]  I'm going to have to go off air and just deal with this, actually.
[01:51:58.840 --> 01:52:03.963]  Because it's a big deal, but there's this psychology that we're not a big deal, which is fine.
[01:52:04.703 --> 01:52:07.345]  But, you know, it's just that
[01:52:08.635 --> 01:52:12.417]  The boldness and the craziness and the things they're doing, it is true.
[01:52:12.457 --> 01:52:13.698]  We're exposing their agenda.
[01:52:14.139 --> 01:52:16.880]  And I know you say there's three major power predatory centers, and I agree.
[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:18.141]  There's groups competing.
[01:52:18.181 --> 01:52:20.983]  But more and more, our elite have sold out to China.
[01:52:21.023 --> 01:52:22.204]  They base things in China.
[01:52:22.684 --> 01:52:24.805]  China's double-crossing the globalists more and more.
[01:52:25.206 --> 01:52:36.153]  But the word is, what we see is, my criticism of Apple and Google moving to China, helping them censor, is that China's really exerting, through Hollywood and everything, its powers.
[01:52:37.256 --> 01:52:50.363]  I see the Pentagon and others pushing back against that, but it looks to me like right now that with everything China's been given, the rare earth minerals, the Panama Canal, shooting at US ships this week, it just seems like China is the big issue.
[01:52:50.644 --> 01:52:57.167]  And I certainly know that that's one reason they're mad at me, Joel Skousen, is that I keep pointing out Russia, Russia.
[01:52:57.667 --> 01:53:03.631]  I'm not saying Russia's our buddy or anything, but China is really what, in my own life, I've experienced that is in my business.
[01:53:05.017 --> 01:53:10.460]  Well, China is the biggest threat to world peace ever and will continue to be so.
[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:17.623]  As I've said before, I think Russia is a predator state and they're intending to join with China in attacking the West.
[01:53:17.663 --> 01:53:22.645]  I think Russia's going down in the next war and China's going to be the new enemy completely.
[01:53:22.685 --> 01:53:30.669]  But you've got to remember there's a difference between assisting and building an enemy and actually getting in bed with them or letting China control.
[01:53:30.689 --> 01:53:32.550]  A lot of people have falsely
[01:53:33.570 --> 01:53:38.592]  I hypothesize that, for example, Israel and Assad controls the New World Order, and I don't think so.
[01:53:38.632 --> 01:53:42.973]  I think they're part of the New World Order, but they're not the controllers.
[01:53:43.033 --> 01:53:45.514]  The New World Order, the globalists, are bigger than Israel.
[01:53:46.154 --> 01:53:51.395]  But the New World Order has been continually building and protecting China.
[01:53:51.915 --> 01:53:57.177]  This is part of the strategy of building an enemy to facilitate a future war, which will allow
[01:53:58.217 --> 01:54:01.559]  A sufficient amount of destruction of our military forces for the U.S.
[01:54:01.599 --> 01:54:04.900]  government to talk us into joining a militarized global government.
[01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:05.761]  That's where we're headed.
[01:54:06.361 --> 01:54:13.144]  Now, that's why, I mean, for example, if they really wanted to stop China and its influence in the United States, they'd pass a simple law.
[01:54:13.304 --> 01:54:19.107]  You have to be an American city to own property or invest in a company in the United States of America.
[01:54:19.387 --> 01:54:20.327]  You have to be a citizen.
[01:54:20.968 --> 01:54:23.429]  That would prohibit all of this Chinese influence.
[01:54:24.150 --> 01:54:27.856]  But they want the influence, not because the Chinese control the globalists.
[01:54:27.936 --> 01:54:33.366]  They are two separate powers, but they're continuing to build the best enemy that money can buy.
[01:54:34.478 --> 01:54:37.599]  And China is a real growing threat militarily.
[01:54:38.059 --> 01:54:49.162]  I'm doing an article for next week's World Affairs Briefs on the China finally reaching an international naval status and Russian and Chinese ships are plying the Atlantic.
[01:54:49.202 --> 01:54:50.822]  They used to stay clear of the Atlantic.
[01:54:51.363 --> 01:54:54.724]  They had only enough ships to handle the Pacific and now they're in the Atlantic.
[01:54:54.744 --> 01:55:00.125]  Russian submarines are spending an inordinate amount of time tracking over U.S.
[01:55:00.245 --> 01:55:03.646]  Internet cables that attach the United States to Europe and Asia.
[01:55:04.466 --> 01:55:08.307]  And I know they're tracking those because they plan on interdicting those cables.
[01:55:08.327 --> 01:55:11.167]  They're going to lose the internet someday when this war comes.
[01:55:15.648 --> 01:55:18.209]  I think they're trying to take us down and set the precedent to take others down.
[01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:22.150]  And also the EU is fining Google and others for not being under their hate speech laws.
[01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:24.990]  And as you said, that's all just made up communist garbage.
[01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:28.251]  America and the Congress and everybody has to stand up to this.
[01:55:28.611 --> 01:55:33.372]  And Trump's biggest failing right now, I think, is not doing something about this and not taking action.
[01:55:34.775 --> 01:55:35.536]  That's right, Alex.
[01:55:35.576 --> 01:55:36.877]  Where is the leadership?
[01:55:37.537 --> 01:55:40.700]  In Congress, in the presidency, in the Department of Justice?
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:44.342]  I mean, there's very clear ways that you can attack these problems.
[01:55:44.382 --> 01:55:45.783]  You can defend free speech.
[01:55:45.823 --> 01:55:51.348]  You can make sure that these companies are declared public companies.
[01:55:51.408 --> 01:55:53.930]  And I'm not against private property in this regard.
[01:55:54.210 --> 01:56:00.995]  I'm just quoting the left who says, once you're in the public domain and you're open to the public, you cannot discriminate.
[01:56:01.587 --> 01:56:13.153]  And I think we need an anti-discrimination law in terms of political free speech that you cannot discriminate against unless it reaches the level of incitement to violence, and that can be very specifically defined in law.
[01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:22.457]  A quick law on that would stop Google, it would stop any of these companies from banning you immediately over this, and you could take them to court based upon the law.
[01:56:22.937 --> 01:56:28.460]  But there is no one in our movement, there's no one in Congress, no one in the presidency,
[01:56:29.167 --> 01:56:31.250]  Who is even hypothesizing about it.
[01:56:31.290 --> 01:56:38.780]  We're simply reacting to the left's use of their tyrannical powers with the media and the courts to do this.
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:46.170]  And the courts would be in a tough situation if we had such a law that protected directly free speech against these terms like hate speech.
[01:56:47.332 --> 01:56:48.893]  Well, most of the public's in a trance.
[01:56:49.073 --> 01:56:51.354]  They've literally been mesmerized by television and the culture.
[01:56:51.395 --> 01:56:51.935]  It's gotten really sick.
[01:56:51.955 --> 01:56:53.436]  We're going to do five more minutes with Joel Scouse.
[01:56:53.476 --> 01:57:00.880]  And please remember, just in the 30 seconds I have, that if you don't financially support us, and if you don't buy the products, then FortWorthStore.com, they will win.
[01:57:01.221 --> 01:57:02.781]  Yes, we'll defeat the frivolous lawsuits.
[01:57:02.822 --> 01:57:03.882]  We'll defeat the hack attacks.
[01:57:04.142 --> 01:57:05.503]  We'll defeat all the takedowns.
[01:57:05.563 --> 01:57:07.765]  But they're trying to take our payments, processing.
[01:57:07.785 --> 01:57:09.245]  They're trying to kill everything right now.
[01:57:09.346 --> 01:57:10.866]  So please rally behind us.
[01:57:10.926 --> 01:57:14.829]  We need a lot of funds to run this operation and continue our operations.
[01:57:15.269 --> 01:57:17.790]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com.

[01:57:27.032 --> 01:57:27.693]  They're all there.

[01:57:31.974 --> 01:57:32.614]  If you don't,
[01:57:33.214 --> 01:57:34.095]  We're in big trouble.
[01:57:34.296 --> 01:57:36.458]  But they're betting that you don't care and you're an idiot.
[01:57:36.739 --> 01:57:37.320]  I know you're not.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.201]  Please support us.
[01:57:38.221 --> 01:57:39.162]  We've got products you need.

[01:57:41.926 --> 01:57:45.050]  And the mailing address is on the website, too.
[01:57:45.410 --> 01:57:46.512]  That may be all we have soon.
[01:57:52.847 --> 01:57:55.729]  Let's go ahead and talk to Make America Great Again, Titan.
[01:57:55.749 --> 01:57:57.030]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:57:57.190 --> 01:58:00.692]  The man, the truth, the resistance, Alex Jones.
[01:58:00.752 --> 01:58:03.534]  I am a Hispanic Trump supporter slash InfoWarrior.
[01:58:03.594 --> 01:58:06.096]  I have a couple points to make, but I want to plug for you real quick.
[01:58:06.156 --> 01:58:09.178]  Survival Shield, Mason Iodine X2, life-changing.
[01:58:09.238 --> 01:58:11.120]  SuperMill Vitality, life-changing.
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:12.801]  Brain Force Plus, life-changing.
[01:58:12.861 --> 01:58:15.162]  Super Blue Non-Fluoride Toothpaste, life-changing.
[01:58:15.182 --> 01:58:16.663]  I'm sure the rest of them are good products.
[01:58:16.683 --> 01:58:18.645]  I haven't been able to try them all yet, but they're awesome.
[01:58:18.705 --> 01:58:20.366]  The hats, the t-shirts, amazing.
[01:58:20.546 --> 01:58:22.408]  Briefly, tell us what the supplements did for you.
[01:58:22.448 --> 01:58:23.629]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:25.411]  Just like you, I'm about the same body type.
[01:58:25.491 --> 01:58:27.153]  I'm short, stocky, strong guy.
[01:58:27.173 --> 01:58:28.975]  I'm Puerto Rican, Italian, and Cuban.
[01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:30.456]  Hispanic Trump supporter, like I said.
[01:58:30.556 --> 01:58:32.678]  And I started working out every day.
[01:58:32.819 --> 01:58:34.220]  I lift weights every day.
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.022]  I don't even have to take the day off.
[01:58:36.102 --> 01:58:37.764]  I'm taking the Survival Shield X2.
[01:58:37.824 --> 01:58:38.985]  I drop that every morning.
[01:58:39.025 --> 01:58:40.006]  I feel fantastic.
[01:58:40.026 --> 01:58:41.026]  My skin is clearing up.
[01:58:41.046 --> 01:58:42.707]  I have psoriasis, so that's clearing up.
[01:58:42.747 --> 01:58:43.967]  My hair is going back thicker.
[01:58:43.987 --> 01:58:47.268]  I'm losing some of it, but it's growing back thicker in the areas that I do have it.
[01:58:47.308 --> 01:58:49.268]  The brain force is just amazing.
[01:58:49.308 --> 01:58:50.568]  That stuff makes you think.
[01:58:50.708 --> 01:58:51.809]  It keeps you on your toes.
[01:58:51.849 --> 01:58:53.049]  The same thing with the iodine.
[01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:55.409]  It just brings this clarity and this focus.
[01:58:55.469 --> 01:58:56.810]  And your products are amazing.
[01:58:56.910 --> 01:58:59.210]  It's like a cleansing for the brain when we listen to you.
[01:58:59.590 --> 01:59:01.011]  And it's just life-changing.
[01:59:01.251 --> 01:59:06.272]  And how people can go against the true resistance, they're going to learn soon that they're on the wrong side of history.
[01:59:06.292 --> 01:59:07.312]  And that's why we're the right.
[01:59:07.512 --> 01:59:09.033]  We're not the alt-right, we're just right.
[01:59:09.053 --> 01:59:12.654]  And I've got to say, I started Titans of Liberty's Truth Wars because of you, Alex.
[01:59:12.674 --> 01:59:14.235]  You are a big inspiration to me.
[01:59:14.255 --> 01:59:14.935]  You're the real deal.
[01:59:15.215 --> 01:59:17.977]  If anybody's listening right now, Alex Jones is the real deal.
[01:59:19.867 --> 01:59:24.050]  Everything we do here at InfoWars is possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:24.070 --> 01:59:25.171]  We have huge specials.

[01:59:29.253 --> 01:59:33.696]  New t-shirts at the InfoWars store as well, including one that I just got.
[01:59:34.117 --> 01:59:36.698]  The new InfoWars hexagon logo.
[01:59:36.878 --> 01:59:38.800]  Very, very cool logo.
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:44.964]  And kind of more discreet, so a radical liberal might not come over and try to punch you in the face or spit on you.
[01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:48.086]  So it's all possible thanks to your support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:48.126 --> 01:59:49.587]  Huge discount store-wide right now.
[01:59:53.931 --> 01:59:58.275]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:59:58.355 --> 01:59:59.816]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:59:59.936 --> 02:00:06.322]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.744 --> 02:00:28.626]  You know, Joel Skousen says I should be calm.
[02:00:29.848 --> 02:00:31.830]  And I'm not even mad they're trying to shut us down.
[02:00:32.410 --> 02:00:33.291]  I expected all this.
[02:00:33.412 --> 02:00:35.594]  It's that I get frustrated that I can't fight them harder.
[02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:39.398]  And I'm like a race car engine kind of blowing up.
[02:00:39.759 --> 02:00:42.302]  So I appreciate the great crew and the listeners and all the support.
[02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:45.451]  You guys are great.
[02:00:45.631 --> 02:00:46.672]  I'm here talking to some of the crew.
[02:00:46.712 --> 02:00:47.773]  All right, we are back live here.
[02:00:47.813 --> 02:00:51.697]  Joel Skousen, in the five minutes we have left, just other points you want to add.
[02:00:52.738 --> 02:00:57.703]  I'm just trying to probe because I know InfoWars is important and we have a lot of great guests and a lot of great info.
[02:00:57.723 --> 02:01:00.967]  We reach five plus billion people on YouTube by the time they shut us down everywhere else.
[02:01:01.327 --> 02:01:03.189]  And we're on a lot of radio stations and TV stations.
[02:01:04.230 --> 02:01:07.632]  Like you said, the vendetta, the foaming at the mouth, the obsession.
[02:01:08.093 --> 02:01:24.384]  When I was in court last week, when they were trying to take my kids away from me again, using lies in the media, they marched in journalism classes, New York Times reporters, others, and they all looked at me like I was worse than Charlie Manson, but it was beyond a look of hate.
[02:01:24.404 --> 02:01:25.765]  It was like a look of lust.
[02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:26.525]  I couldn't even, it was like a...
[02:01:29.253 --> 02:01:43.527]  And I had John Ronson here last year, who I've known for like 20 years, and I've turned around and he was looking at me going... And it's like, it's this Trump derangement syndrome, like were the darker demons released by the media saying it's okay to hate?
[02:01:44.207 --> 02:01:49.893]  Because these people have gone into like, this totally crazy mode, and I don't understand where the hate comes from.
[02:01:51.857 --> 02:01:58.506]  Well, oftentimes, like suicide, hate comes from people getting infected with letting Satan into their brain.
[02:01:58.566 --> 02:02:02.611]  And, you know, a lot of people don't understand that it comes in your own grammar.
[02:02:02.651 --> 02:02:07.277]  It sounds like you talking to yourself, but those deep, hateful, angry voices really are
[02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:13.312]  The dark side of the spiritual spectrum trying to influence people and they don't realize that they're being influenced.
[02:02:13.352 --> 02:02:21.395]  They think that they're legitimately angry and of course they lead themselves over time up to receiving those type of feeling comfortable with them.
[02:02:21.935 --> 02:02:32.959]  But Satan is a very real part of our society here and I think it's important that people realize that, that this is not just normal behavior.
[02:02:35.407 --> 02:02:36.348]  We've got three minutes left.
[02:02:36.408 --> 02:02:39.289]  Other key points, Joe Skousen, about things happening in the country and the world.
[02:02:39.309 --> 02:02:39.950]  But I agree with you.
[02:02:40.090 --> 02:02:50.616]  Whenever I have anxiety or I'm angry at somebody, if I just think about Christ, my children, and being good, and just think about being peaceful, which I am when I'm not on air, then I just have great peace and can go back to sleep.
[02:02:51.516 --> 02:02:52.417]  You know, like late at night.
[02:02:55.578 --> 02:03:00.099]  So the things that I'm really concerned about is, one, not the midterm election so much.
[02:03:00.199 --> 02:03:03.240]  I don't think the Democrats are going to take the majorities in the House.
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.841]  They may well take the Senate.
[02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:09.202]  That's a fairly easy one to do with the small margin that we have there.
[02:03:09.302 --> 02:03:15.043]  But I don't think they're going to take the House, so it's going to be a split, you know, Congress.
[02:03:15.123 --> 02:03:19.504]  It really won't change the dynamics anymore of Trump's difficulty in passing anything.
[02:03:19.805 --> 02:03:20.765]  He can't pass anything.
[02:03:21.585 --> 02:03:23.987]  I don't think that's going to change significantly.
[02:03:24.027 --> 02:03:26.289]  What's really going to change though is we're going to see this attack on Iran happen.
[02:03:39.457 --> 02:03:49.861]  We're going to see North Korea get away with continuing to develop nuclear weapons because Donald Trump has completely defaulted on his pledge not to let this happen.
[02:03:50.341 --> 02:03:53.022]  And I'm very, very disturbed about Donald Trump for doing this.
[02:03:53.522 --> 02:03:59.104]  I'd like to be in the White House to hear what they're telling him to keep him from going back to the military option.
[02:03:59.584 --> 02:04:04.586]  It may be that he has been succumbed to the promise of the Nobel Peace Prize, which they're never going to give him.
[02:04:05.166 --> 02:04:11.408]  But, you know, they certainly laid that out there to get him onto the peace bandwagon completely.
[02:04:12.088 --> 02:04:16.569]  But why he doesn't get upset and say, all right, you played me for a fool long enough.
[02:04:16.589 --> 02:04:22.511]  I mean, look at Pompeo this week going to North Korea and say, just give us 60 percent of your nuclear weapons.
[02:04:22.551 --> 02:04:24.991]  Well, you don't even know what 100 percent is.
[02:04:25.011 --> 02:04:27.452]  So how can you talk about 60, 70 percent?
[02:04:28.052 --> 02:04:31.433]  You haven't even got an inventory for North Korea about what kind of nuclear weapons.
[02:04:31.473 --> 02:04:33.374]  And you couldn't believe it, even if they gave it to you.
[02:04:33.414 --> 02:04:34.294]  You have to have.
[02:04:35.049 --> 02:04:36.770]  International inspectors on the ground.
[02:04:37.110 --> 02:04:42.994]  As I've said in the World Affairs Brief many times, Donald Trump needs to say this in the next round of negotiations.
[02:04:44.255 --> 02:04:48.498]  You have two weeks to let international inspectors, which will include U.S.
[02:04:48.678 --> 02:04:51.660]  officers... Hold on, I know you gotta go, but we're back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:53.701]  Spend a couple minutes on Joel Skousen.
[02:04:54.161 --> 02:04:59.245]  What you think Trump needs to say to Kim Jong-un and how you think Trump got lured into this.
[02:05:04.485 --> 02:05:04.946]  Have you heard?
[02:05:05.426 --> 02:05:07.509]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:08.890]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[02:05:09.070 --> 02:05:10.092]  They're all censoring us.
[02:05:10.472 --> 02:05:16.359]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[02:05:16.679 --> 02:05:19.683]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[02:05:30.615 --> 02:05:34.298]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:05:34.458 --> 02:05:39.502]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:05:39.682 --> 02:05:40.863]  And here's the best part.
[02:05:41.003 --> 02:05:42.624]  It is absolutely free.
[02:05:42.844 --> 02:05:47.808]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:05:48.048 --> 02:05:51.911]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:05:52.011 --> 02:05:55.914]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[02:05:56.135 --> 02:06:00.258]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:06:07.592 --> 02:06:16.735]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:06:18.675 --> 02:06:27.858]  InfoWars.com has been down now for an hour, and it's definitely DDoS attacks, but I didn't take it down.
[02:06:27.878 --> 02:06:32.859]  That's been going on for a week and a half since Tim Cook announced, according to the New York Times,
[02:06:34.463 --> 02:06:36.504]  They were taking us off and then they talked to Zuckerberg.
[02:06:36.524 --> 02:06:39.325]  He has these Sunday night meetings with all the other big tech heads.
[02:06:39.345 --> 02:06:42.226]  They admit the collusion and then 20 plus groups do it.
[02:06:43.486 --> 02:06:50.369]  And then we got a top Fortune 20 company, I'm not going to name them, that does software and infrastructure, says you're kicked off our platform.
[02:06:51.792 --> 02:06:54.894]  And then we send emails to the top going, my god, that's tortious interference.
[02:06:55.234 --> 02:06:55.854]  We have a contract.
[02:06:55.874 --> 02:06:57.635]  And they're like, we've been using it for years.
[02:06:57.655 --> 02:06:59.216]  And they go, actually, that's incorrect.
[02:06:59.236 --> 02:07:00.237]  Someone else was mistaken.
[02:07:00.617 --> 02:07:01.237]  You're still with us.
[02:07:01.897 --> 02:07:06.760]  So we're dealing with just insane levels of just mutinous, crazed behavior.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:08.041]  And Joel Skousen was getting into that.
[02:07:08.061 --> 02:07:15.405]  I want him to finish up with North Korea and what he thinks Trump should do in an encapsulated piece about how he thinks he's been set up.
[02:07:15.445 --> 02:07:19.727]  And I agree, as much as we want peace and things, this is starting to go sideways.
[02:07:19.747 --> 02:07:20.728]  And the left's going to love that.
[02:07:21.718 --> 02:07:25.403]  Obviously China's weighed in and put their pressure on.
[02:07:25.423 --> 02:07:27.085]  I want to finish up with China as well.
[02:07:27.245 --> 02:07:34.154]  But Joel, just briefly, on this InfoWars.com being banned and this sabotage.
[02:07:35.595 --> 02:07:35.775]  I don't
[02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:56.711]  Saying, oh, don't worry, we'll deal with fake news.
[02:07:57.111 --> 02:08:03.815]  He came up with the idea that everybody put these notices up over news first that it wasn't real, run by Snopes and the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:08:03.855 --> 02:08:06.356]  And now he's appearing to be a prime mover.
[02:08:06.897 --> 02:08:09.098]  I find it very interesting that he's moved Apple to China.
[02:08:09.398 --> 02:08:10.499]  It's become tax exempt.
[02:08:10.519 --> 02:08:16.102]  He put the iCloud codes with the government and said, oh, in China, when you move here, the government's part of your company.
[02:08:16.402 --> 02:08:17.883]  I mean, they're hiding that in plain view.
[02:08:19.003 --> 02:08:31.088]  I mean, I think it's outrageous to have a guy that runs some of the worst factories in the world with suicide nets and everything, moralizing how I need to be banned, and then everyone else, just like dominoes, goes, yes, sir, Mr. Cook, and falls into line.
[02:08:31.148 --> 02:08:37.071]  It shows the monopoly power of Google, Apple, and, of course, Facebook working in unison.
[02:08:37.131 --> 02:08:40.212]  It's classic trust behavior, classic monopoly, isn't it?
[02:08:41.408 --> 02:08:49.072]  Well, the thing you have to ask yourself is, how did these people get from normal, liberal, techie-type people to globalists?
[02:08:49.832 --> 02:08:58.277]  There was a process that happened over the past decade, and I can tell you, if you knew what went on, you'd find there were some very private phone calls.
[02:08:58.777 --> 02:09:04.280]  Remember, every one of these tech companies had some government seed money from CIA and other dark places.
[02:09:04.775 --> 02:09:05.135]  I don't
[02:09:24.778 --> 02:09:32.184]  You've got to, you know, come on to the control system, to the system which is, you know, going towards this new, glorious new world order.
[02:09:32.665 --> 02:09:34.927]  They got converted at some point to globalism.
[02:09:34.967 --> 02:09:37.529]  It isn't that Tim Cook is pro-Chinese.
[02:09:37.569 --> 02:09:38.610]  He's a globalist.
[02:09:39.971 --> 02:09:40.772]  No, no, I agree.
[02:09:40.852 --> 02:09:42.513]  I mean, we're marrying into this global thing.
[02:09:42.533 --> 02:09:43.534]  It doesn't mean we're Chinese-run.
[02:09:43.574 --> 02:09:47.237]  It means we're merging and their values of oppression are now coming here.
[02:09:47.297 --> 02:09:49.259]  So let me ask this last question again in North Korea.
[02:09:51.061 --> 02:09:56.645]  Why would Jack Dorsey, who I know people have had dinner with him, multiple folks, they're like, no, no, Dorsey's scared.
[02:09:57.025 --> 02:09:57.765]  He doesn't like it.
[02:09:57.785 --> 02:10:00.867]  He's a liberal, but he thinks once this starts, it'll shut everything down.
[02:10:00.907 --> 02:10:02.328]  But he's been banning some conservatives.
[02:10:02.588 --> 02:10:05.570]  But then when they all did this, Jack Dorsey came out and said, no, we're not.
[02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:09.613]  Then CNN said, well, look at these tweaks we think are wrong, which really were out of context.
[02:10:10.693 --> 02:10:13.054]  They just, Twitter just told us, please delete these.
[02:10:13.254 --> 02:10:15.075]  We did it just to see what would happen.
[02:10:15.775 --> 02:10:21.097]  But then, I know for a fact, I'm not going to leave it at this, Twitter then opened up some channels with messages to me.
[02:10:21.117 --> 02:10:24.558]  I don't know if I'm being suckered or what, but why do you think Jack Dorsey's doing that?
[02:10:26.739 --> 02:10:27.179]  I don't know.
[02:10:27.199 --> 02:10:36.623]  You know, it appeared when he put your tweets under review the very next day after he made that strong stand in support that I'm not going to ban, it indicated that he was under tremendous pressure.
[02:10:37.367 --> 02:10:39.691]  And he said, all right, we're going to put him through a review process.
[02:10:39.891 --> 02:10:42.775]  And that's why you got the messages of those to delete.
[02:10:42.795 --> 02:10:44.037]  He had to give them something.
[02:10:44.678 --> 02:10:46.500]  But apparently he isn't a globalist.
[02:10:46.801 --> 02:10:50.726]  I mean, if he were a globalist, he'd be saying yes to them.
[02:10:50.806 --> 02:10:53.590]  So they haven't got him converted yet, in my opinion.
[02:10:55.305 --> 02:10:57.446]  But I almost don't even want to tell the truth about that, though.
[02:10:57.466 --> 02:10:58.246]  We always tell the truth.
[02:10:58.306 --> 02:11:01.087]  It's like we have this, almost like a problem being honest about everything.
[02:11:01.247 --> 02:11:02.307]  We say things we probably shouldn't say.
[02:11:02.327 --> 02:11:04.268]  It's not lying to not say something you know.
[02:11:04.868 --> 02:11:07.549]  But I just still have to almost blurt everything out unless it's in total confidence.
[02:11:08.410 --> 02:11:09.990]  But yeah, that's basically what I've heard.
[02:11:10.410 --> 02:11:15.252]  And I almost don't want to say that Jack Dorsey might be a good guy, because now they'll pile on him even more, Joel.
[02:11:17.199 --> 02:11:17.839]  Yeah, they will.
[02:11:17.859 --> 02:11:20.100]  You know, this isn't over.
[02:11:20.161 --> 02:11:25.443]  I mean, look what happened to the Verizon chief when he bucked government spying.
[02:11:25.463 --> 02:11:26.164]  He wasn't going to do it.
[02:11:26.204 --> 02:11:27.844]  They literally took this guy down.
[02:11:28.485 --> 02:11:31.126]  So his name, his days are numbered.
[02:11:31.146 --> 02:11:32.627]  These guys are very, very powerful.
[02:11:33.267 --> 02:11:41.376]  Anyway, you know, this is one of the things I've covered in this week's World Affairs Brief that people really need to get and read is this whole thing about taking down the deep state in the swamp.
[02:11:41.957 --> 02:11:45.781]  They are so much more powerful than we think, than Donald Trump thinks.
[02:11:46.341 --> 02:11:55.451]  Anybody who thinks they're going to take down the deep state, which runs every single federal law enforcement, at least the dark side of those law enforcement agencies, the judicial department,
[02:11:56.492 --> 02:11:59.675]  75% of Congress, they are just kidding themselves.
[02:11:59.755 --> 02:12:04.421]  If they're believing this guy called Q, well, I'm convinced he's on his deep state.
[02:12:04.481 --> 02:12:10.708]  Oh, he's the guy that says, trust Miller, trust this, uh, trust the Attorney General?
[02:12:10.748 --> 02:12:11.388]  What a joke!
[02:12:11.448 --> 02:12:12.730]  Q's been absolutely wrong.
[02:12:14.389 --> 02:12:15.551]  No, that's absolutely right.
[02:12:15.571 --> 02:12:17.593]  But it's amazing the following he's got.
[02:12:17.934 --> 02:12:19.816]  I mean, they got t-shirt factories pumping out.
[02:12:19.856 --> 02:12:21.038]  That means there's big money.
[02:12:21.078 --> 02:12:28.488]  They got a Hollywood producer that put out a video anonymously on cue and how wonderful this was that he's going to take down the Deep Swan.
[02:12:28.888 --> 02:12:31.612]  Look, why don't they put their name to it?
[02:12:32.262 --> 02:12:32.983]  What's illegal?
[02:12:33.023 --> 02:12:34.565]  What's dangerous about this video?
[02:12:34.666 --> 02:12:35.066]  Nothing.
[02:12:35.286 --> 02:12:37.830]  You don't put your name to it because this is Deep State.
[02:12:38.351 --> 02:12:38.831]  I agree.
[02:12:38.851 --> 02:12:39.693]  We're almost out of time.
[02:12:39.873 --> 02:12:40.954]  Finish up with North Korea.
[02:12:40.974 --> 02:12:41.655]  Just recap.
[02:12:42.056 --> 02:12:43.157]  Because we all want peace.
[02:12:43.178 --> 02:12:44.039]  We want a deal to happen.
[02:12:44.099 --> 02:12:45.641]  And Trump brought him to the verge.
[02:12:46.082 --> 02:12:48.926]  But then I saw North Korea run up there and meet with China and I thought, oh boy.
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:50.540]  That's right.
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:51.480]  And they got there marching.
[02:12:51.681 --> 02:12:52.841]  Donald Trump could be played.
[02:12:53.501 --> 02:12:54.601]  And they did play him.
[02:12:54.661 --> 02:12:59.563]  I mean, Donald Trump got on an ego trip after that Singapore meeting and said, he's promised me everything in the world.
[02:13:00.283 --> 02:13:02.064]  And the nuclear threat is over.
[02:13:02.224 --> 02:13:03.364]  And now it clearly isn't.
[02:13:03.424 --> 02:13:04.124]  He's still building.
[02:13:04.365 --> 02:13:05.485]  Donald Trump needs to do this.
[02:13:06.149 --> 02:13:09.390]  You got two weeks, Kim, to let international and U.S.
[02:13:09.471 --> 02:13:16.253]  inspectors and take possession of all your nuclear facilities and weapons or we go back to the military option.
[02:13:16.754 --> 02:13:18.855]  And that doesn't mean an immediate attack.
[02:13:18.915 --> 02:13:21.716]  It just means we're going to take care of this militarily.
[02:13:21.776 --> 02:13:22.816]  It doesn't mean we're going to attack.
[02:13:22.896 --> 02:13:26.178]  It means tighten the noose again, start the drills again and move the forces into place.
[02:13:27.677 --> 02:13:32.198]  Yeah, but you really do need to take out his military so he's no longer a threat to North Korea.
[02:13:32.778 --> 02:13:35.119]  And that would take out the trigger event for World War III.
[02:13:35.179 --> 02:13:37.840]  North Korea has been preserved for decades as the trigger event.
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:45.062]  And by allowing Kim to get away with postponing any disarmament indefinitely, which is basically what he's doing,
[02:13:45.602 --> 02:13:51.667]  Trump is allowing that trigger event to be going into the next decade when Russia and China will be ready.
[02:13:52.127 --> 02:13:52.627]  No, I agree.
[02:13:52.647 --> 02:13:53.988]  That's why it's critical to fix this.
[02:13:54.008 --> 02:13:56.911]  But if you look at Kim, he looked totally freaked out out of his mind at the meetings.
[02:13:57.231 --> 02:14:00.773]  The word is that some of those generals really run things, but he's got some control.
[02:14:00.793 --> 02:14:04.196]  I mean, isn't it that those generals are really CHICOM officers anyways?
[02:14:05.056 --> 02:14:05.617]  Absolutely.
[02:14:05.657 --> 02:14:08.919]  They're working for China and Kim really does not run the country.
[02:14:08.979 --> 02:14:12.302]  They want the appearance of a crazy man so that when the war starts,
[02:14:12.902 --> 02:14:15.285]  Russian China can have plausible deniability.
[02:14:15.325 --> 02:14:16.927]  It's that crazy man who started the war.
[02:14:16.947 --> 02:14:17.507]  It wasn't us.
[02:14:17.948 --> 02:14:21.011]  But they are going to be ready to back it up.
[02:14:21.111 --> 02:14:24.314]  So Kim probably does want peace when Trump hears that from Dennis Rodman.
[02:14:24.555 --> 02:14:26.016]  The problem is he's not running the show.
[02:14:26.997 --> 02:14:27.838]  That's exactly right.
[02:14:27.858 --> 02:14:30.080]  He doesn't know what the long-term game plan is.
[02:14:30.120 --> 02:14:31.642]  Now notice Kim writes nice letters.
[02:14:31.682 --> 02:14:32.663]  Is it good cop, bad cop?
[02:14:32.883 --> 02:14:34.245]  Then the generals say another thing.
[02:14:35.640 --> 02:14:35.840]  Yeah.
[02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:42.483]  And so this is I'm just afraid this is not going to go well.
[02:14:42.543 --> 02:14:45.744]  Donald Trump has completely given up the military option.
[02:14:45.804 --> 02:14:47.565]  I don't think he will go back to it.
[02:14:48.145 --> 02:14:51.427]  And so I think Kim is building nuclear weapons as we speak.
[02:14:51.907 --> 02:14:56.670]  Sure, exactly.
[02:14:56.710 --> 02:15:01.173]  But Trump went with the angle that he thought no one really tried to do detente and try a peace deal.
[02:15:01.213 --> 02:15:02.274]  He did offer him everything.
[02:15:02.574 --> 02:15:04.175]  And if they reject it, that's their problem now.
[02:15:04.415 --> 02:15:05.776]  At least we've taken the high road, though.
[02:15:06.036 --> 02:15:10.059]  But so now we have to, I agree, come in with strength now that they're starting to back off.
[02:15:15.149 --> 02:15:15.450]  All right.
[02:15:15.550 --> 02:15:16.831]  That's always great information.
[02:15:17.032 --> 02:15:19.254]  Joel Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com, editor over there.
[02:15:19.595 --> 02:15:20.095]  Great work.
[02:15:20.156 --> 02:15:23.039]  Everybody can go there and subscribe or I know they send you an email.
[02:15:23.059 --> 02:15:24.221]  You'll send them a free copy, right?
[02:15:24.761 --> 02:15:27.585]  Yeah, editor at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:15:27.605 --> 02:15:29.528]  They'll get a free copy of the current issue.
[02:15:30.389 --> 02:15:31.690]  And folks, this is powerful info.
[02:15:31.710 --> 02:15:32.712]  Thank you, Joel, for the time.
[02:15:33.888 --> 02:15:34.288]  You're welcome.
[02:16:03.638 --> 02:16:05.220]  Hate is such a malleable term.
[02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:09.103]  I mean, you know, hate really means something, an opinion I don't agree with.
[02:16:09.324 --> 02:16:17.011]  Because if you want to get rid of hate speech, I mean, I don't see how anything you've said is anywhere close to what that New York Times columnist you showed earlier saying.
[02:16:17.271 --> 02:16:19.013]  Board members saying whites are subhuman.
[02:16:19.193 --> 02:16:22.696]  Yeah, I mean, how is that not hate speech if there is such a thing?
[02:16:22.737 --> 02:16:24.778]  I just hate that term hate speech because it's...
[02:16:25.439 --> 02:16:26.120]  It's not a thing.
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:33.125]  What really bothers me about your cases, just globally, is that I don't see anybody from the traditional media backing you up.
[02:16:33.305 --> 02:16:35.667]  And I don't understand how they can look at this.
[02:16:35.887 --> 02:16:40.890]  You know, you questioned the official narrative of what happened at Sandy Hook at some point.
[02:16:41.231 --> 02:16:43.973]  At the beginning, you said, you made an investigation.
[02:16:44.393 --> 02:16:45.694]  I don't care what happens.
[02:16:46.154 --> 02:16:53.480]  Anything that happens, when I get an official story from my government, if I'm not questioning it, I want somebody else to question it to make me question it.
[02:16:53.965 --> 02:17:00.067]  Even if it comes around that, hey, maybe we're going to have a rare circumstance where our government doesn't lie to us one bit.
[02:17:00.087 --> 02:17:01.948]  I mean, it might happen once in a while.
[02:17:02.328 --> 02:17:03.289]  Unicorns make shifts.
[02:17:03.329 --> 02:17:06.510]  But the point of the media is to be a watchdog.
[02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:07.490]  You're the fourth estate.
[02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:10.331]  I take a lot of flack for coming on your show and representing you.
[02:17:10.771 --> 02:17:12.392]  There are a lot of people angry at me.
[02:17:12.632 --> 02:17:14.173]  And I say, well, you know, tell me.
[02:17:14.913 --> 02:17:24.776]  If you hate this guy so much, show me what the problem is, and they'll send me a link to the New York Times, or they'll send me a link to some other article paraphrasing what you said.
[02:17:24.796 --> 02:17:27.177]  And I said, yeah, but now bring me the original source.
[02:17:27.697 --> 02:17:31.118]  And when I go find it, and I said, well, that's not really what was said here.
[02:17:31.238 --> 02:17:33.078]  Well, then there's this back pedal.
[02:17:33.098 --> 02:17:36.399]  It's like, well, he's enabling such speech, or he's encouraging it.
[02:17:36.439 --> 02:17:37.340]  I said, wait a second.
[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:41.301]  What I want you to think about is how we need a robust marketplace of ideas.
[02:17:41.621 --> 02:17:44.662]  I don't come on your show because I agree with everything you have to say.
[02:17:44.682 --> 02:17:47.002]  You know, before the election, I wrote this article here.
[02:17:47.623 --> 02:17:50.723]  Is the First Amendment safe from Donald Trump on CNN?
[02:17:51.464 --> 02:17:57.865]  And I was concerned because when Trump made his speech that said, we're going to open up the libel law.
[02:17:57.925 --> 02:17:58.605]  I was concerned too.
[02:17:58.625 --> 02:17:59.386]  I don't think he got it.
[02:17:59.586 --> 02:18:03.307]  And you know, and it made me, I mean, I said, wow, that, that got my hackles up.
[02:18:03.487 --> 02:18:04.447]  I mean, I am not.
[02:18:05.007 --> 02:18:07.688]  But now in his own cases, he's, he's using anti-slap.
[02:18:08.468 --> 02:18:09.409]  It's kind of funny, isn't it?
[02:18:09.549 --> 02:18:25.998]  You know, how this is flipped, because now that he got elected, now it is not Donald Trump, but people are anti-Donald Trump, who I should have written this article, I should have written another version of this article saying, is the First Amendment safe for people who have Trump derangement syndrome?
[02:18:26.599 --> 02:18:31.862]  You know, I remember last night we were talking and somebody said, you know, hey, has the right ever really done this?
[02:18:32.862 --> 02:18:38.028]  And I had to correct him, and I said, yes, if you bring the camera down here, heed their rising voices.
[02:18:38.048 --> 02:18:51.802]  New York Times versus Sullivan, the foundational case when it comes to our First Amendment rights, where it was constitutionalized that if you are talking about a public figure and then expand it to public events,
[02:18:52.663 --> 02:18:56.065]  You must prove defamation over the actual man.
[02:18:56.085 --> 02:18:58.746]  And this was the South of the KKK suing everybody to shut down the regime.
[02:18:58.786 --> 02:18:59.766]  That's exactly what it was.
[02:18:59.806 --> 02:19:02.467]  It was exactly what you have going on today.
[02:19:02.687 --> 02:19:10.271]  It was the civil rights movement was invading the South with people who were writing about equality, with people who were trying to
[02:19:10.851 --> 02:19:14.612]  Make this idea of equality and civil rights infected.
[02:19:14.692 --> 02:19:19.873]  You know, they were trying to spread this idea and how did these people who wanted to fight against equality deal with it?
[02:19:20.233 --> 02:19:27.115]  They dealt with it through these kind of crazy defamation suits where they were trying to bankrupt anybody who came down there and tried to report.
[02:19:27.215 --> 02:19:30.736]  And now the left is trying to get rid of New York Times versus Sullivan.
[02:19:30.756 --> 02:19:34.377]  They admit to overturn the First Amendment so they can, you know,
[02:19:34.437 --> 02:19:35.618]  But I guess it's the Democrats again.
[02:19:35.678 --> 02:19:38.980]  Look, New York Times vs. Sullivan is sacred as far as I'm concerned.
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:43.102]  And you know, so far, I haven't seen Donald Trump actually do anything to go against it.
[02:19:43.462 --> 02:19:45.963]  I think his two Supreme Court nominees would support it.
[02:19:46.404 --> 02:19:49.465]  And I can't say the same for the Supreme Court nominees on the left.
[02:19:49.625 --> 02:19:52.827]  So... The Democrats are going after New York Times vs. Sullivan.
[02:19:53.448 --> 02:19:55.008]  At this point, it looks that way.
[02:19:55.048 --> 02:19:55.188]  Yeah.
[02:19:55.369 --> 02:19:55.709]  We'll be back.
[02:20:03.462 --> 02:20:15.350]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.930 --> 02:20:17.651]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.691 --> 02:20:19.633]  Because there is a war on.
[02:20:19.913 --> 02:20:20.913]  Or your mind.
[02:20:31.658 --> 02:20:32.338]  I just knew too much.
[02:20:32.358 --> 02:20:33.779]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:21:01.954 --> 02:21:02.994]  Does that make me crazy?
[02:21:06.775 --> 02:21:07.275]  Possibly.
[02:21:07.295 --> 02:21:13.697]  You see, when you're out there... Alright.
[02:21:16.077 --> 02:21:22.199]  I want to give the phone number out and take your call specifically on InfoWars.com being hacked, being taken down.
[02:21:23.976 --> 02:21:31.720]  And how they're trying to take our payment processors, how they're trying to shut down our emails, how they're shutting down Disqus Us, and it's all these sick, evil companies.
[02:21:33.041 --> 02:21:47.609]  WebChimp, all of it, when Tim Cook that runs the biggest slave factories with suicide nets, forced abortion, trying to kill gay people, Buddhists, Christians, sells their organs, not a damn word out of him, and the New York Times says he's the man of the moral vision.
[02:21:48.730 --> 02:21:50.991]  And he says ban info wars a week and a half ago.
[02:21:52.551 --> 02:21:59.793]  And then like dominoes it happens and now they're doing it to all these other conservatives and all these other Christians and all these other nationalists.
[02:22:03.194 --> 02:22:07.975]  And there's Congress just asleep at the switch wearing one of those little clown hats with a propeller on the top.
[02:22:09.295 --> 02:22:11.036]  Just having no idea what planet they're on.
[02:22:12.236 --> 02:22:17.117]  Trump's distracted with Amoroso and all her edited audio and all that crap.
[02:22:17.177 --> 02:22:18.237]  This is how the country dies.
[02:22:20.218 --> 02:22:20.838]  In the deep state.
[02:22:22.284 --> 02:22:25.546]  Globalist, multinationals, eugenicists, control freaks.
[02:22:26.826 --> 02:22:27.787]  They're allied with China.
[02:22:27.807 --> 02:22:29.208]  They're screwing the country over.
[02:22:30.789 --> 02:22:31.529]  And they think it's funny.
[02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:33.270]  They think you're stupid.
[02:22:34.591 --> 02:22:37.472]  And they do everything they can to make you stupid so they can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:22:38.033 --> 02:22:39.273]  And then you look at these globalists.
[02:22:39.493 --> 02:22:40.594]  Almost none of them have children.
[02:22:40.974 --> 02:22:42.335]  They're all very unhappy themselves.
[02:22:42.415 --> 02:22:46.137]  It's just like, but they wanted power so they're in charge.
[02:22:48.567 --> 02:22:53.508]  And they're just, this is totally un-American to have CNN all over the news saying, he's got the number one apps!
[02:22:53.928 --> 02:22:55.929]  Infowars official, take it down!
[02:22:56.229 --> 02:22:59.069]  People aren't like, whoa, you people are scum!
[02:23:00.369 --> 02:23:01.210]  I mean, folks are.
[02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:08.851]  But it's just the outrageousness of how they've, like an abused woman, the guys abuse them so long, they're just used to it.
[02:23:09.551 --> 02:23:12.392]  It's like, you know, he's got a tire iron out now beating her in the head.
[02:23:12.432 --> 02:23:16.793]  It's like they let Antifa beat up whoever they want, even beat up NBC and CNN reporters.
[02:23:18.157 --> 02:23:20.779]  Yeah, people like Cuomo saying it's okay, it's good, or ignoring it.
[02:23:20.819 --> 02:23:23.441]  I mean, these people are a bunch of yes-men.
[02:23:23.861 --> 02:23:37.371]  And so now, the big tech companies that were born in this country are in China, because that's the globalist model of authoritarianism, and it's coming here, and we're the one ringing the alarm bells, so we've got to be shut down because we would dare to talk about it.
[02:23:37.391 --> 02:23:41.174]  Then there's a must-see article on Infowars.com.
[02:23:44.005 --> 02:23:45.966]  That I'm going to read, and then I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:23:46.667 --> 02:23:47.907]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:23:47.947 --> 02:23:48.948]  He's got his guest on.
[02:23:48.988 --> 02:23:52.450]  You know, most people, when their website's taken down, they're being shut down, would cancel the guest.
[02:23:52.470 --> 02:23:55.532]  But the guest, you know, is into social media and stuff, and that's great.
[02:23:55.892 --> 02:23:58.253]  So maybe we'll spend a little bit of time on him before he's being shut down.
[02:23:59.034 --> 02:24:03.776]  But my whole deal is, would people notice if we completely shut down?
[02:24:03.796 --> 02:24:06.338]  Because, you know, once we go down, everything goes down.
[02:24:08.317 --> 02:24:12.781]  And they've said that, and the globalists, and the chi-coms, and Soros admit they're making their move at Hillary.
[02:24:12.821 --> 02:24:18.905]  You wanted somebody to fight them, you wanted somebody to stand up to them, you wanted somebody to take action, you wanted some- and then we started having victory!
[02:24:18.925 --> 02:24:21.688]  Everybody's kinda like it's a video game or a TV show.
[02:24:23.549 --> 02:24:23.929]  It's not.
[02:24:26.812 --> 02:24:29.714]  And I look at the satanic hatred that mainstream media has for me.
[02:24:32.346 --> 02:24:35.487]  They're all pathetic losers and they just want slavery.
[02:24:36.347 --> 02:24:42.009]  So, there's InfoWars.com before I hit refresh on it earlier.
[02:24:42.029 --> 02:24:44.390]  I wonder why this doesn't work.
[02:24:46.731 --> 02:24:47.251]  Doesn't matter.
[02:24:47.752 --> 02:24:48.972]  Why does anything need to work?
[02:24:50.232 --> 02:24:50.773]  Here, let's do this.
[02:24:52.313 --> 02:24:53.314]  That'll fix that mouse.
[02:24:54.354 --> 02:24:55.794]  Thing hardly works half the time anyways.
[02:24:56.635 --> 02:24:58.836]  So, that's where we are as a country.
[02:24:58.856 --> 02:24:59.876]  It's where we are as a nation.
[02:25:01.328 --> 02:25:02.309]  That's where we are as a world.
[02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:04.691]  And I guess they've got a splash page up.
[02:25:04.751 --> 02:25:05.632]  That looks pretty cool.
[02:25:05.652 --> 02:25:06.372]  Coming for that quick.
[02:25:06.753 --> 02:25:08.014]  Infowars is under attack.
[02:25:08.514 --> 02:25:09.935]  Please visit our other channels now.
[02:25:11.537 --> 02:25:16.001]  Newswars.com, Infowars store, PrisonPlanet.com and Twitter.
[02:25:16.061 --> 02:25:18.823]  And of course, they're hitting all of those.
[02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:25.809]  They see it as our extermination, our annihilation, is the answer to everything.
[02:25:27.230 --> 02:25:28.952]  And there'll be this beautiful, wonderful world.
[02:25:31.129 --> 02:25:38.871]  Once you shut it down, we might want to get somebody to write an article from fullwars.com about for about an hour and thirty minutes we've been down.
[02:25:40.471 --> 02:25:41.811]  There's a prisonplanet.com.
[02:25:41.851 --> 02:25:42.411]  We just might.
[02:25:42.511 --> 02:25:43.412]  I run a news organization.
[02:25:43.452 --> 02:25:43.972]  Everybody's great!
[02:25:45.172 --> 02:25:48.333]  We just might want to get a video out that we're down.
[02:25:49.613 --> 02:25:49.993]  Just maybe.
[02:25:51.033 --> 02:25:52.473]  Something like that.
[02:25:52.594 --> 02:25:59.355]  But, you know, they had the big giant ongoing attack last week and
[02:26:00.643 --> 02:26:17.973]  Now they're doing it to everybody else, and now they want the sites shut down themselves, because Congress and the President didn't respond to the payment processors, and the emails, and the Facebook, and the Google, and the YouTube, and the Apple, and the Stitcher, and the Spotify, and everything else.
[02:26:18.353 --> 02:26:19.133]  So why not?
[02:26:19.273 --> 02:26:20.654]  America is asleep!
[02:26:20.994 --> 02:26:21.835]  America wants...
[02:26:22.455 --> 02:26:23.376]  America wants to get gang-raped.
[02:26:23.456 --> 02:26:25.137]  America wants to get pushed over.
[02:26:25.217 --> 02:26:26.719]  America wants to get dominated.
[02:26:26.739 --> 02:26:32.603]  That's the big green light, the deep state, the hemiogenesis that funded Hitler and created China.
[02:26:35.346 --> 02:26:36.106]  That's where they are.
[02:26:36.126 --> 02:26:39.169]  That's what they want.
[02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:41.611]  That's what they're doing.
[02:26:42.625 --> 02:26:45.186]  Because we've been raised to be sat in front of a television.
[02:26:46.247 --> 02:26:47.968]  We've been raised to be spectators.
[02:26:48.048 --> 02:26:54.131]  So, those people, even if they're not wimps, somebody walks over and punches them in the face, they just sit there.
[02:26:54.151 --> 02:26:56.012]  Because they think this is a video game.
[02:26:57.953 --> 02:27:02.135]  They think it's funny Tim Cook glances around and, you know, says, I'm a gay rights guy.
[02:27:02.175 --> 02:27:05.537]  And then, you know, loves China, you know, killing gays, doesn't say a damn word about it.
[02:27:05.557 --> 02:27:07.758]  That's the worst, horrible, demonic factories.
[02:27:08.058 --> 02:27:11.279]  Even the Chi-Coms say, pay us two dollars more a day and they could have houses.
[02:27:11.299 --> 02:27:12.200]  And he goes, F them.
[02:27:13.626 --> 02:27:18.467]  But he's Tim Cook, because the media said he was this big liberal, he was this big god like Zuckerberg.
[02:27:19.888 --> 02:27:23.709]  An internal email saying F everybody, F you, F my users.
[02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.830]  Trust me.
[02:27:28.971 --> 02:27:30.151]  It's unconsciousness.
[02:27:31.791 --> 02:27:33.572]  It's the culture of TV heads.
[02:27:33.672 --> 02:27:35.372]  It's the culture of video game heads.
[02:27:35.432 --> 02:27:36.093]  It's the culture.
[02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:40.394]  Everybody's just like... The Chinese aren't like that.
[02:27:41.929 --> 02:27:43.089]  Islamists aren't like that.
[02:27:43.109 --> 02:27:44.890]  They're just sharpening their knives constantly.
[02:27:45.270 --> 02:27:48.311]  They see weakness and a bunch of traitors that are ready to sell them out.
[02:27:50.692 --> 02:27:56.975]  And if Tim Cook sees, you know, a billion, five hundred million slaves, and he goes, hmm, that'll be delicious.
[02:27:58.495 --> 02:28:00.396]  It's all about his power.
[02:28:01.216 --> 02:28:03.897]  Now they sell you a phone for three times what it should be sold for.
[02:28:03.917 --> 02:28:07.378]  And it just goes on and on from that point.
[02:28:07.398 --> 02:28:08.579]  So I'm gonna try to be a nice boy.
[02:28:10.191 --> 02:28:11.152]  InfoWars is down.
[02:28:11.172 --> 02:28:12.213]  InfoWars has been hacked.
[02:28:12.253 --> 02:28:13.473]  InfoWars has been taken down.
[02:28:13.894 --> 02:28:15.015]  It should be a major news item.
[02:28:15.075 --> 02:28:16.376]  Obviously, no one even cares around here.
[02:28:17.016 --> 02:28:22.300]  So, the toll-free number is 877-789-ALEX.
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:22.600]  877-789-2539.
[02:28:23.120 --> 02:28:25.162]  Our phones work.
[02:28:25.302 --> 02:28:26.783]  They don't want you to be able to comment on InfoWars.
[02:28:27.063 --> 02:28:31.927]  They don't want you to be able to, you know, have any free speech in this country, but you can still call in on this subject.
[02:28:33.949 --> 02:28:40.832]  For people taking the calls, the subject of InfoWars being down, and what's happening, and the whole move to ban free speech, and what we should do.
[02:28:41.192 --> 02:28:43.713]  That's what the phones are open about.
[02:28:43.733 --> 02:28:49.916]  If I could have just one power in my life, it'd be occasionally on a topic I want to discuss, that people call in about that.
[02:28:50.076 --> 02:28:51.376]  It would be amazing.
[02:28:51.816 --> 02:28:53.997]  It would be really fantastic.
[02:28:54.797 --> 02:28:55.398]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:55.418 --> 02:28:55.798]  Stay with us.
[02:29:00.325 --> 02:29:03.468]  The President of the United States is racist.
[02:29:04.149 --> 02:29:04.889]  He's a punk.
[02:29:05.850 --> 02:29:06.611]  He's a dog.
[02:29:07.412 --> 02:29:08.112]  He's a pig.
[02:29:08.313 --> 02:29:09.834]  And he can suck my f***ing d***.
[02:29:10.014 --> 02:29:12.477]  He's a con, a bullsh** artist, a mutt.
[02:29:12.617 --> 02:29:17.121]  Kiss my motherf***ing ass, you bitch, punk, d*** sucker.
[02:29:17.141 --> 02:29:18.562]  The President of the United States
[02:29:19.543 --> 02:29:20.644]  Is a weak man.
[02:29:20.704 --> 02:29:22.705]  He's not only unfit to be president.
[02:29:22.865 --> 02:29:26.927]  In my opinion, his lack of empathy, his lack of leadership, his lack of courage.
[02:29:27.287 --> 02:29:28.688]  He's unfit to be human.
[02:29:28.768 --> 02:29:32.389]  He is clearly trying to ignite a civil war in this country.
[02:29:32.409 --> 02:29:35.431]  This is CNN.
[02:29:40.547 --> 02:29:45.650]  Donald J. Trump is president of the United States.
[02:29:59.915 --> 02:30:05.179]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:09.223]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:10.063 --> 02:30:16.309]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:18.090 --> 02:30:24.451]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[02:30:25.251 --> 02:30:30.492]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:30:31.093 --> 02:30:43.235]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[02:30:43.635 --> 02:30:46.836]  Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped.
[02:30:46.976 --> 02:30:50.517]  I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.
[02:31:11.579 --> 02:31:14.680]  Record low unemployment and a record high stock market.
[02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:17.320]  The Trump economy is red hot.
[02:31:21.181 --> 02:31:25.663]  Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.
[02:31:25.923 --> 02:31:30.444]  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.
[02:31:30.744 --> 02:31:34.785]  Now Kim Jong-un says President Trump will pay dearly for those words.
[02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:41.812]  Getting a good picture of everybody so we look nice and handsome and thin.
[02:31:41.852 --> 02:31:42.852]  Beautiful.
[02:31:44.273 --> 02:31:44.553]  Perfect.
[02:31:46.273 --> 02:31:49.735]  North Korea now committing to complete denuclearization.
[02:31:49.755 --> 02:31:53.897]  I mean, it's truly remarkable what he's doing.
[02:31:54.057 --> 02:31:58.919]  He has done more than any president in recent history, certainly in the last half century.
[02:31:59.579 --> 02:32:00.779]  He's not a politician.
[02:32:01.580 --> 02:32:02.280]  He's one of us.
[02:32:04.781 --> 02:32:06.882]  Never, ever, ever give up.
[02:32:09.395 --> 02:32:11.916]  Relish the opportunity to be an outsider.
[02:32:12.637 --> 02:32:20.481]  Embrace that label because it's the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference.
[02:32:20.881 --> 02:32:26.324]  Treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation.
[02:32:27.506 --> 02:32:29.868]  Three American hostages are back home.
[02:32:30.348 --> 02:32:34.811]  I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit.
[02:32:35.471 --> 02:32:36.452]  Seize this moment.
[02:32:36.832 --> 02:32:37.973]  Believe in yourselves.
[02:32:38.413 --> 02:32:39.534]  Believe in your future.
[02:32:40.035 --> 02:32:42.496]  And believe once more in America.
[02:32:43.517 --> 02:32:47.440]  I will fight for you with every breath in my body.
[02:32:48.781 --> 02:32:52.083]  And I will never, ever let you down.
[02:32:52.523 --> 02:32:54.965]  The forgotten man and the forgotten woman.
[02:32:56.158 --> 02:32:58.401]  You're not forgotten anymore.
[02:32:58.421 --> 02:33:06.072]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:39.787 --> 02:33:45.850]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:46.271 --> 02:33:48.312]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:48.332 --> 02:33:50.733]  I was around for forty days.
[02:33:51.193 --> 02:33:56.456]  Last night in Little Rock put me in a haze.
[02:33:56.656 --> 02:34:00.539]  Sweet, sweet Connie was doing her act.
[02:34:00.639 --> 02:34:03.060]  She had the whole show and that's a natural fact.
[02:34:24.427 --> 02:34:26.327]  There's a lot of controversy around this.
[02:34:26.367 --> 02:34:28.067]  That work about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:34:28.167 --> 02:34:33.968]  Alex Jones?
[02:34:34.428 --> 02:34:36.589]  The far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[02:34:43.833 --> 02:34:44.694]  Alex Jones!
[02:34:44.714 --> 02:34:45.595]  Scum!
[02:34:45.715 --> 02:34:49.098]  Russian scum!
[02:34:49.138 --> 02:34:54.083]  Until worse comes to mind.
[02:34:54.103 --> 02:35:00.190]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:35:00.650 --> 02:35:01.971]  I will not let you down.
[02:35:02.112 --> 02:35:04.994]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:35:11.294 --> 02:35:34.445]  They have been trying to hack and DDoS attack and sabotage our servers and have people within major companies bring us down since the head of the Chinese slave factory censorship combine, the head of Apple, Mr. Cook, Mr. Zuckerberg, and the heads of Google and Alphabet decided to unperson us last Sunday night, eight, nine days ago.
[02:35:34.745 --> 02:35:36.366]  And currently, InfoWars is down.
[02:35:37.469 --> 02:35:39.110]  They were trying to bring it down this weekend.
[02:35:39.130 --> 02:35:42.252]  The crew had to stay up here basically to midnight many nights.
[02:35:43.653 --> 02:36:01.044]  And it's all a big vitriolic joke to the left online and all these newspapers and the nightmare image of Brian Stelter's crazy looking pumpkin head saying take off his apps, bring down his website, take his sponsors, bankrupt him, drive him into submission.
[02:36:02.505 --> 02:36:03.806]  It's so un-American.
[02:36:03.886 --> 02:36:04.987]  It's so illegal.
[02:36:05.147 --> 02:36:06.848]  It's so disgusting.
[02:36:08.697 --> 02:36:09.958]  That I get really, really angry.
[02:36:10.918 --> 02:36:22.184]  And I think about them taking our email system to be able to email you, taking Discuss Us away, WebChimp, Credio, after they took AdRoll away from us that was funding much of the operation a year and a half ago.
[02:36:22.224 --> 02:36:24.546]  Now they took this away, when Credio came to us.
[02:36:24.926 --> 02:36:38.073]  And then our general counsel wants the virtue signal, because Apple and Google and Facebook have made an internet monopoly, and we're all close to imploding, you know, so we have to grovel to the system, this is basically what's going on, hoping they buy us up.
[02:36:38.553 --> 02:36:46.138]  And just watching a nation of cowards and scum in corporate America who don't care about their birthright, the First Amendment, NOTHING!
[02:36:49.380 --> 02:36:53.602]  And the Chinese Communists all over the news, controlling Hollywood, controlling what's happening.
[02:36:54.083 --> 02:37:07.191]  There is an article that is in the Washington Times today by a national security expert that works for Fox News, and he's a special operations veteran, and a graduate of the Air Force Academy.
[02:37:08.695 --> 02:37:26.589]  I want to get him on the show, L. Todd Wood, and he talks about how China is the threat and how Hollywood's run by it and the telecoms and the media and how Google this year walked off a Defense Department project because their engineers said, we will not work for America, we hate you!
[02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:31.833]  And so many of their operatives are either Chinese communists or they're in league with it.
[02:37:33.654 --> 02:37:37.877]  The globalists completely sold us out and now they're trying to shut down our free speech.
[02:37:39.028 --> 02:37:43.571]  I mean, hell, Europe Wars was down today being attacked before I went on air.
[02:37:43.651 --> 02:37:46.413]  Now it's Infowars.com's been down for two hours.
[02:37:48.775 --> 02:37:51.837]  And I haven't gone over all of it.
[02:37:51.857 --> 02:37:54.339]  I've got a bunch of the articles and a bunch of the documents right here.
[02:37:54.759 --> 02:38:07.688]  But I mean, I have to get on the phone with executives from major companies and find out how their employees are deleting our software licenses to run back-end stuff for inventory
[02:38:08.228 --> 02:38:22.694]  That's the espionage level we're at, and it shows the Democrats will go to any lengths, because they've been trained to hate America in college, and they've been trained to hate America by Hollywood, and China owns it now, and every Netflix show that's political is pro-communist China, anti-America.
[02:38:23.214 --> 02:38:26.315]  It's just everywhere, and it's even admitted they run the country now.
[02:38:28.556 --> 02:38:33.858]  I've got a stack of news here about China putting out government broadcasts into the United States.
[02:38:34.358 --> 02:38:35.519]  That's in the LA Times.
[02:38:37.802 --> 02:38:41.727]  It's incredible how sold out we are, and there you go.
[02:38:42.728 --> 02:38:48.755]  So first it's, oh, you know, the people at Apple, Tim Cook can do what he wants, and Zuckerberg can do what he wants.
[02:38:48.975 --> 02:38:56.725]  When Zuckerberg makes statements about the publishing industry and other newspapers, he goes, I'll hold your hand while you are dying, like at hospice.
[02:38:58.129 --> 02:38:59.629]  We're not dying, we're exploding!
[02:38:59.709 --> 02:39:00.350]  So what do you do?
[02:39:00.410 --> 02:39:17.774]  You shadowbat us, and you smother us, and you manipulate us, and you build straw men, and you lie about who we are, and you try to assassinate the truth, and then you censor all these other conservatives and libertarians and people, because it backfires on you, you stop covering it, and now you go after our actual infrastructure, which is totally illegal.
[02:39:19.754 --> 02:39:21.775]  Go read the article, it's up on InfoWars.org.
[02:39:21.795 --> 02:39:22.755]  I'm sorry, you can't go there.
[02:39:22.915 --> 02:39:25.416]  It's at the Washington Times.
[02:39:26.934 --> 02:39:27.854]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:39:27.954 --> 02:39:30.115]  China is a threat and it may be too late.
[02:39:30.235 --> 02:39:31.636]  For now, you can read it on Twitter.
[02:39:31.676 --> 02:39:32.877]  I tweeted it at RealAlexJones.
[02:39:32.897 --> 02:39:49.644]  But you need to get upset like you got upset last week and send a strong message that you know what's going on and you know what's unfolding and you're upset and you're going to take action and call Congress and call the White House and call talk radio and say we're losing our First Amendment now.
[02:39:50.024 --> 02:39:51.805]  Infowars is the first domino.
[02:39:52.005 --> 02:39:54.366]  They're already banning everybody from Laura Loomer to
[02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:14.833]  Gavin McGinnis and everybody else that stand up for this country and against the Antifa thugs that are attacking men, women, and children, and against the globalists, and against... ABC got caught doing fake stuff with actors, where a guy in a MAGA hat goes over and is mean to other people and tries to throw them out of a restaurant, when it's the Democrats acting like that?
[02:40:17.875 --> 02:40:20.317]  These people are out of control!
[02:40:20.657 --> 02:40:22.038]  They're willing to do anything!
[02:40:23.370 --> 02:40:27.733]  And they've taken our acquiescence, and they've taken our kindness as weakness, and now they're going for broke.
[02:40:27.753 --> 02:40:28.593]  And I'll add this again.
[02:40:28.994 --> 02:40:46.986]  While it's still up, InfowarStore.com, while they haven't taken all our payment processes away, people need to vote with their dollars and let me know that A, you want great products, but B, you're gonna support the Infowar into the future, because this is when we need your support.
[02:40:47.206 --> 02:40:48.187]  This is when we need the help.
[02:40:48.207 --> 02:40:51.509]  The other times, I'm up here like, oh, I expect to be attacked, we're moving forward, blah, blah, blah.
[02:40:52.759 --> 02:40:56.664]  This is the main test right now, and I expect it to get even worse in the next few weeks.
[02:40:56.684 --> 02:40:57.765]  They want to break our will.
[02:40:58.346 --> 02:41:05.454]  I've got to cool off and be calm, like Joel Scouser said earlier, and not get too angry about what they're doing and trying to fight them, because I'm not depressed.
[02:41:05.514 --> 02:41:06.095]  It's the opposite.
[02:41:06.215 --> 02:41:11.261]  I am on fire wanting to fight, wanting to be politically active and involved and win.
[02:41:12.834 --> 02:41:18.319]  But as sure as the sun came up, they're calling for violence and they're getting ready to stage violence against themselves to blame Infowars and Trump.
[02:41:18.439 --> 02:41:25.666]  And I believe that's what this is, is preparation for a false flag against a big tech giant or CNN that they will stage.
[02:41:26.815 --> 02:41:29.816]  Or their surrogates will stage, and then be blamed on us.
[02:41:29.836 --> 02:41:36.178]  And that's why this is so critical in such an emergency, because they wouldn't be doing this if they weren't planning something big going into the midterms.
[02:41:36.218 --> 02:41:53.785]  So now is the time of maximum vigilance on the streets, calling to talk radio, speaking at city council about this, where there's a buzz so big that we let the Democrats know, you're carrying out a criminal deal with the Chi-Coms, you think you're gonna, there's an American awakening, you're gonna snuff it out and bring in civil war and civil unrest and shut us all down.
[02:41:54.085 --> 02:42:01.610]  It ain't happening, and every city council, and every globalist organization, and every newspaper politely and nicely needs to be let known.
[02:42:01.930 --> 02:42:03.891]  We know you guys are having your Antifa meetings.
[02:42:04.132 --> 02:42:07.134]  We know you're organizing this crap, and we see through you.
[02:42:08.454 --> 02:42:09.555]  So we've got, why should I even?
[02:42:09.675 --> 02:42:11.676]  Free shipping, the best products, everything.
[02:42:12.117 --> 02:42:14.098]  Right now we barely even make money on a lot of these products.
[02:42:14.118 --> 02:42:17.800]  We sell them so low so we can be competitive in the market, but I need people to understand.
[02:42:18.121 --> 02:42:21.503]  Fund us to fight the bullies, to save the internet, to save InfoWars.
[02:42:23.112 --> 02:42:29.456]  It's still standing right now, even though they're all over it, filing fake complaints on us, saying we sell child porn on there to take it down.
[02:42:29.937 --> 02:42:31.978]  I'm getting the reports, I'm getting who the people are.
[02:42:32.519 --> 02:42:35.721]  By the time I sue some of them, we'll already be through the election and civil war.
[02:42:36.241 --> 02:42:41.865]  But don't worry, I'm gonna start suing, because I gotta let these people know, just like with the lawsuits, you sue me, I go after you.
[02:42:42.485 --> 02:42:43.546]  But you want somebody to fight?
[02:42:43.886 --> 02:42:44.387]  I'm fighting!
[02:42:45.256 --> 02:42:47.837]  But I need your support and your prayers and to spread the links now.
[02:42:48.177 --> 02:42:48.777]  It's happening.
[02:42:48.997 --> 02:42:50.217]  This is worse than last week.
[02:42:50.337 --> 02:42:51.837]  Infowars.com is down.
[02:42:51.857 --> 02:42:54.738]  And I'm gonna take this live video, put it on Twitter and everywhere else.
[02:42:55.018 --> 02:42:55.858]  Get it out, folks!
[02:42:56.098 --> 02:42:56.818]  Take action!
[02:42:56.958 --> 02:42:58.159]  Don't let them break their will!
[02:42:58.339 --> 02:42:58.819]  Your calls!
[02:42:59.259 --> 02:43:02.159]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[02:43:02.339 --> 02:43:06.500]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[02:43:06.900 --> 02:43:09.101]  They're set to pass rules, not a law.
[02:43:09.781 --> 02:43:14.444]  That if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[02:43:14.804 --> 02:43:18.126]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[02:43:18.546 --> 02:43:22.809]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[02:43:23.189 --> 02:43:27.091]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[02:43:27.331 --> 02:43:30.033]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[02:43:30.473 --> 02:43:34.736]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[02:43:35.236 --> 02:43:38.258]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[02:43:38.678 --> 02:43:53.514]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[02:43:53.754 --> 02:43:55.056]  That is critical to this fight.
[02:43:55.296 --> 02:43:57.278]  We will prevail if you take action and I know
[02:43:59.088 --> 02:44:03.532]  Alpha Power, vital male androgen biosynthesis promoter.
[02:44:03.672 --> 02:44:11.920]  Now I've got page after page after page of the science, of the research, and the facts on the ingredients in Alpha Power.
[02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:13.642]  But, here's what you want to know.
[02:44:14.616 --> 02:44:20.579]  You want to go to m4wrestore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[02:44:21.239 --> 02:44:24.780]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[02:44:25.661 --> 02:44:33.664]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[02:44:34.244 --> 02:44:41.928]  We set out to look at the already best-selling brands out there and make it even better, even stronger, and basically souped up.
[02:44:42.708 --> 02:44:46.493]  It's got the best of ancient science, with the latest developments as well.
[02:44:47.033 --> 02:44:51.018]  It's Alpha Power, and quite frankly, I don't even really need to take Alpha Power.
[02:44:52.097 --> 02:45:06.946]  If I take Alpha Power, which I do occasionally, if I feel down or don't feel like I have a lot of energy, it makes me have incredible stamina, amazing libido, and also I already have, not really anger issues, but I'm a little bit aggressive sometimes.
[02:45:07.366 --> 02:45:12.709]  And so Alpha Power is so strong that I personally don't take it a lot.
[02:45:13.029 --> 02:45:14.570]  I'm not going to sit here and tell you.
[02:45:14.890 --> 02:45:16.211]  Oh man, it's really great, it really works.
[02:45:16.231 --> 02:45:20.815]  I'm going to tell you, be careful with Alpapower because I said I want to dominate the industry.
[02:45:21.375 --> 02:45:25.679]  I want people to know that we put the most money into this of any other product out there.
[02:45:25.699 --> 02:45:27.060]  I'm going to explain this because this is critical.
[02:45:27.861 --> 02:45:34.086]  The average supplement, you can look this up online, there's industry publications, Wall Street Journal, has a five to seven times markup.
[02:45:34.466 --> 02:45:36.528]  That's a 500 to 700 percent markup.
[02:45:37.128 --> 02:45:38.709]  Our average markup is about 130 percent or so.
[02:45:38.729 --> 02:45:40.070]  Some are 90 percent, some are 150.
[02:45:40.131 --> 02:45:41.552]  You've got marketing other costs that go in.
[02:45:44.454 --> 02:45:45.295]  But here's an example.
[02:45:46.116 --> 02:45:53.703]  The average male or female enhancement, over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[02:45:53.723 --> 02:45:55.424]  It just has a little bit in it.
[02:45:55.905 --> 02:46:02.090]  Many times the bottle, this is a nice glass bottle, costs more than the ingredients that these companies put out.
[02:46:02.771 --> 02:46:07.855]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[02:46:08.155 --> 02:46:16.481]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[02:46:16.881 --> 02:46:17.902]  Nobody else does that.
[02:46:18.002 --> 02:46:20.664]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[02:46:21.184 --> 02:46:37.325]  Bottom line, you're getting top-of-the-line supplements that people absolutely love, that have blown me away, that fund the info war, and we are industry leaders in quality testing and the amount of the best product that we put into the product that ends up getting delivered to your door.
[02:46:37.725 --> 02:46:46.689]  So you get the best supplements at the very, very best price, and you fund the InfoWar that's given the whole world incredible results against the globalists, a 360 win.
[02:46:47.029 --> 02:46:49.050]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[02:46:49.451 --> 02:46:55.173]  The second shipment is now in at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsTore.com by calling toll free, triple A, 253-3139.
[02:46:55.193 --> 02:46:55.834]  A total 360 win.
[02:46:55.874 --> 02:46:57.755]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.053 --> 02:47:22.654]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson is coming up.
[02:47:22.714 --> 02:47:23.574]  I'm going to co-host some of them.
[02:47:23.614 --> 02:47:24.814]  He's got a very special guest.
[02:47:25.735 --> 02:47:27.035]  I just want to beat the censors.
[02:47:27.595 --> 02:47:29.236]  And yes, you've made the app number one.
[02:47:29.256 --> 02:47:30.596]  You've given it a five-star review.
[02:47:31.477 --> 02:47:34.498]  Millions have gone and signed up for the podcast.
[02:47:34.858 --> 02:47:39.720]  Same thing has gone on with the InfoWars.com forward slash newsletters.
[02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:41.260]  We can email you and get around the censors.
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:44.001]  But InfoWars.com is down right now.
[02:47:44.021 --> 02:47:46.062]  So let me just make this one-minute statement so I can get it out there.
[02:47:47.366 --> 02:47:49.447]  There is an attack on our birthright of free speech.
[02:47:49.507 --> 02:47:51.427]  They are taking people's speech across the board.
[02:47:51.567 --> 02:47:55.949]  All nationalists, all conservatives are being shadow banned and dialed down to nothing.
[02:47:56.369 --> 02:48:01.171]  Now they're going to total de-platforming with the Chinese communist social score system coming here.
[02:48:01.711 --> 02:48:03.912]  Apple and Google have moved to China.
[02:48:03.972 --> 02:48:06.753]  They are admittedly implementing it here with the Democrats.
[02:48:07.253 --> 02:48:13.599]  Senator Warner, Senator Murphy are admitting they're coming in with the EU-style censorship and working with China.
[02:48:13.959 --> 02:48:15.060]  This is treason.
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:16.481]  This is outrageous.
[02:48:16.521 --> 02:48:19.844]  And we're so used to freedom, we don't know what we're dealing with.
[02:48:19.864 --> 02:48:21.245]  We don't know how to respond to this.
[02:48:21.345 --> 02:48:24.468]  This is violating campaign finance law for the Democrats.
[02:48:24.848 --> 02:48:26.369]  It is manipulating the election.
[02:48:27.321 --> 02:48:28.161]  This is real.
[02:48:28.702 --> 02:48:31.383]  This is happening and InfoWars.com is down.
[02:48:31.763 --> 02:48:33.044]  We have NewsWars.com.
[02:48:33.364 --> 02:48:34.524]  We have PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:34.544 --> 02:48:36.345]  We have InfoWarsStore.com so you can support us.
[02:48:36.645 --> 02:48:37.866]  You can still get the apps for now.
[02:48:37.926 --> 02:48:43.069]  CNN's lobbying to have those taken down along with the criminal New York Times owned by a foreign corrupt kingpin.
[02:48:43.449 --> 02:48:45.009]  This is like a sick nightmare!
[02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:48.931]  But this is how America falls if we don't wake up and take action.
[02:48:49.512 --> 02:48:51.332]  I'm Alex Jones and I won't back down.
[02:48:51.392 --> 02:48:54.254]  I won't give in to these tyrants and I'm counting on you to do the same.
[02:48:54.514 --> 02:48:56.095]  But now's the time to raise the alarm.
[02:48:56.875 --> 02:48:57.855]  Against this takeover.
[02:48:59.156 --> 02:49:08.340]  Alright, Julie, Michael, Duke, Mark, Aaron, Fernando, Stefan, Kevin, Carter, John, Lily, Matthew, we'll start taking your phone calls here.
[02:49:10.029 --> 02:49:10.809]  Who's up first?
[02:49:10.829 --> 02:49:12.490]  Let's go to Julie in Canada.
[02:49:12.510 --> 02:49:13.851]  Julie, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:49:13.871 --> 02:49:14.191]  Go ahead.
[02:49:14.732 --> 02:49:16.733]  Alex, thanks for taking our call.
[02:49:17.213 --> 02:49:19.234]  My husband and I watch your show every day.
[02:49:19.254 --> 02:49:19.955]  We love it.
[02:49:20.235 --> 02:49:24.718]  And I just wanted to say that your Super Glue toothpaste is a fantastic product.
[02:49:25.318 --> 02:49:26.979]  I recommend it highly to everybody.
[02:49:26.999 --> 02:49:31.321]  And I just wanted to mention that what happens in the States happens in Canada.
[02:49:32.662 --> 02:49:35.564]  And we're very, very concerned that
[02:49:36.423 --> 02:49:40.384]  Trump might not get elected if he doesn't deal with this issue.
[02:49:40.744 --> 02:49:42.425]  This is affecting a lot of people.
[02:49:43.105 --> 02:49:44.325]  I don't know what you think about that.
[02:49:44.385 --> 02:49:45.025]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:49:45.065 --> 02:49:45.966]  This is the issue.
[02:49:46.006 --> 02:49:47.146]  This is the end of the First Amendment.
[02:49:47.186 --> 02:49:48.306]  It's more important than the Second.
[02:49:48.726 --> 02:49:50.767]  Because it's absolutely critical.
[02:49:51.307 --> 02:49:53.928]  And we can't speak out for the Second Amendment or the Fourth Amendment.
[02:49:53.968 --> 02:49:54.948]  It's all gone, Julie.
[02:49:54.988 --> 02:49:56.488]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:49:56.548 --> 02:50:02.550]  And Trump is dropping the ball because he's always distracted with Amarosa and, you know, all this other crud.
[02:50:04.542 --> 02:50:08.085]  But somebody's got to be able to get a hold of him and talk to him.
[02:50:08.105 --> 02:50:08.846]  I don't know.
[02:50:09.586 --> 02:50:12.448]  I got him info three weeks ago and then all hell broke loose.
[02:50:12.468 --> 02:50:13.609]  That's another reason they're after me.
[02:50:14.090 --> 02:50:15.331]  They know we're getting stuff to Trump.
[02:50:16.809 --> 02:50:24.612]  And I'm trying in between trying to keep us on air to get a report up of the examples and what should be done and some of my connections the White House just went cold.
[02:50:24.732 --> 02:50:27.233]  I mean it's it's this is some shit.
[02:50:27.313 --> 02:50:28.074]  They're making their move.
[02:50:28.114 --> 02:50:28.854]  God bless you Julie.
[02:50:28.874 --> 02:50:29.274]  We love you.
[02:50:29.574 --> 02:50:29.834]  Yeah.
[02:50:29.914 --> 02:50:32.595]  Canada is under a lot of draconian censorship now.
[02:50:33.076 --> 02:50:34.816]  Where if you read Bible verses you get arrested.
[02:50:34.836 --> 02:50:37.097]  I mean they're taking mother and father out of the national anthem.
[02:50:38.078 --> 02:50:38.678]  It's incredible.
[02:50:40.579 --> 02:50:44.720]  We'll take a call from Michael in the Netherlands over there in the Dutch areas.
[02:50:45.140 --> 02:50:46.221]  Michael go ahead you're on the air.
[02:50:47.093 --> 02:50:47.974]  Hi Alex.
[02:50:48.835 --> 02:50:50.276]  Welcome to Europe.
[02:50:50.657 --> 02:50:51.658]  It's a great show.
[02:50:51.718 --> 02:50:53.520]  I have one question.
[02:50:54.421 --> 02:51:00.388]  Why is InfoWars not working together with Wikileaks, Mark Dice and David Icke?
[02:51:01.755 --> 02:51:04.716]  I've been inviting David on for about a year and a half because I'm pro-Trump.
[02:51:04.736 --> 02:51:05.336]  He won't come on.
[02:51:06.176 --> 02:51:07.796]  And then WikiLeaks has their own thing.
[02:51:07.816 --> 02:51:12.497]  They've defended us, but they're mainly mainline leftist, but they're actually real liberals, so they're good people.
[02:51:12.557 --> 02:51:16.138]  It's just that they're scared of the propaganda about me, the strongman, so they don't come on.
[02:51:16.458 --> 02:51:17.718]  And then Mark Dice does come on.
[02:51:17.758 --> 02:51:20.099]  He's a one-man show, and he needs a lot more help.
[02:51:20.139 --> 02:51:20.919]  He's very talented.
[02:51:21.319 --> 02:51:25.540]  I've tried to hire Mark Dice, but he's kind of, you know, likes where he is in San Diego.
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:26.700]  So there's your answer.
[02:51:27.387 --> 02:51:33.131]  Okay, but it's about the mainstream media, who is attacking now Infoboards.
[02:51:33.571 --> 02:51:37.994]  So I thought, when you're both together, fight to it.
[02:51:38.594 --> 02:51:39.695]  No, I totally agree.
[02:51:39.755 --> 02:51:42.176]  And we need all these other hosts, who I have all the niggas censored.
[02:51:42.196 --> 02:51:45.979]  When they took Mark Dice's YouTube channel away years ago, I rallied for him and helped him get it back.
[02:51:46.439 --> 02:51:47.360]  And Mark's been helping us.
[02:51:47.420 --> 02:51:49.521]  But just, yes, if they can get me, they can get everybody.
[02:51:49.561 --> 02:51:50.302]  God bless you, Michael.
[02:51:50.842 --> 02:51:52.203]  Okay, Duke in Tennessee.
[02:51:52.283 --> 02:51:53.544]  Duke, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:51:53.584 --> 02:51:53.864]  Go ahead.
[02:51:55.669 --> 02:52:08.220]  This is Duke contacting GI Joe headquarters to report that Cobra has in fact taken over the broadcast energy transmitter and has shut down Alex Jones and InfoWars.com.
[02:52:08.701 --> 02:52:16.788]  I do have photographic evidence dated August 7, 2018, verifying that Apple and their software
[02:52:17.923 --> 02:52:21.687]  Would not load Alex Jones live webcast feed.
[02:52:21.727 --> 02:52:27.253]  The media could not be loaded either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported.
[02:52:27.593 --> 02:52:28.034]  Wait a minute.
[02:52:28.094 --> 02:52:31.517]  So what I've been told by IT is even though InfoWars is down, our streams are still going out.
[02:52:31.918 --> 02:52:35.542]  You're telling me you want an Apple platform and now they're not even loading the show?
[02:52:36.707 --> 02:52:40.228]  That was last Monday I had this happen to me.
[02:52:40.648 --> 02:52:43.508]  So this was this was going on since at least last Monday.
[02:52:43.929 --> 02:52:47.109]  Today I went... Oh I mean I'm under total cyber attack.
[02:52:47.409 --> 02:52:50.690]  I'm getting reports from IT that China is not even hiding it.
[02:52:51.010 --> 02:52:57.271]  We have China out of Beijing and Peking hitting us with DOS attacks but that was but this isn't a DOS takedown.
[02:52:57.731 --> 02:52:58.652]  A D-DOS takedown.
[02:52:58.672 --> 02:53:00.312]  They're hitting themselves.
[02:53:01.383 --> 02:53:04.065]  Well, the store may also be compromised.
[02:53:04.245 --> 02:53:13.693]  I just placed an order today because one of the only things I knew to do was to fight even harder was to contribute to InfoWars.com.
[02:53:14.674 --> 02:53:26.043]  I pledged an auto shipment every 30 days in the amount of $101 in honor of the 101st Airborne Division that I served with in combat twice in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:53:26.824 --> 02:53:30.549]  And I wanted to let every veteran know out there, now is the time.
[02:53:30.609 --> 02:53:31.590]  We need to stand up.
[02:53:31.690 --> 02:53:33.012]  We need to speak out.
[02:53:33.112 --> 02:53:34.694]  We need to get the word out.
[02:53:35.235 --> 02:53:39.059]  Alex Jones, InfoWars, the first domino in this war.
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:40.641]  The fire is burning.
[02:53:40.661 --> 02:53:43.745]  And I've got a message for the globalists.
[02:53:44.226 --> 02:53:45.227]  We'll never give up.
[02:53:45.646 --> 02:53:47.228]  We'll stay till the fight's won.
[02:53:47.568 --> 02:53:47.948]  G.I.
[02:53:47.968 --> 02:53:51.552]  Joe is there because Alex Jones is a real American hero.
[02:53:51.572 --> 02:53:54.855]  The Cobra believes you will be defeated!
[02:53:55.135 --> 02:53:59.580]  China and Tim Cook and Zuckerberg will defeat you!
[02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:00.440]  God bless.
[02:54:00.921 --> 02:54:01.742]  Having some fun there.
[02:54:03.038 --> 02:54:09.281]  Seriously, the store is all secured and super high quality and has all the certificates and things.
[02:54:09.301 --> 02:54:13.383]  They're trying to take the payment processors where the companies won't then process your order.
[02:54:13.863 --> 02:54:15.244]  So get your orders in while you can.
[02:54:15.304 --> 02:54:20.806]  I mean, they did this to the NRA a year ago and then six months ago and NRA had to sue and file injunctions.
[02:54:21.106 --> 02:54:25.929]  For a couple days, you know, NRA could not take your orders for a t-shirt or a membership.
[02:54:26.109 --> 02:54:26.529]  Remember that?
[02:54:27.642 --> 02:54:32.112]  And they were doing it to, like, Cabela's and stuff, so... I mean, they're moving against everybody, folks.
[02:54:32.152 --> 02:54:36.202]  This is them telling you, you can't commerce, you can't talk to who you want.
[02:54:36.663 --> 02:54:36.883]  Shub.
[02:54:38.715 --> 02:54:50.142]  I'll tell you, bottom line, I just want to win this war, and I want to see big dollar signs in Fuller Store, because, you know, we've been kind of in the red the last six months with all the censorship and stuff, but I'd save money to pay for things, so.
[02:54:50.562 --> 02:55:02.729]  But now, it's like the lawsuits and all of it, we need to make a lot of money now, we need to bring it in to fund things, so I can just firehose the enemy, and get injunctions against them, and get top lawyers, we're getting it all set up, and we'll have some big W's.
[02:55:03.109 --> 02:55:05.811]  That's why they're doing all this de-platforming now, I've been beating their fake lawsuits.
[02:55:06.798 --> 02:55:13.819]  And I don't want to get into the details of that, but they haven't filed any new ones in months and months because I sue the people that sue me.
[02:55:14.459 --> 02:55:18.300]  Except for Sandy Hook, I waived that when you counter-sue, and they lied and said I did sue.
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:19.920]  So, it's total deception.
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:21.261]  The media thinks they'll defeat you.
[02:55:21.481 --> 02:55:22.681]  They're not going to defeat you.
[02:55:24.021 --> 02:55:27.122]  Mark, Aaron, Fernando, got a whole bunch of callers here.
[02:55:27.162 --> 02:55:27.762]  Stefan.
[02:55:29.842 --> 02:55:31.263]  How do you beat censorship, they're asking?
[02:55:31.303 --> 02:55:32.783]  You just spread the word by word of mouth.
[02:55:32.823 --> 02:55:33.503]  Nothing can stop you.
[02:55:35.694 --> 02:55:36.535]  They can shut me down.
[02:55:36.555 --> 02:55:37.435]  You can go tell the truth.
[02:55:37.495 --> 02:55:38.316]  Nothing's going to stop you.
[02:55:38.336 --> 02:55:39.317]  Go to city council meetings.
[02:55:39.337 --> 02:55:40.157]  Call into talk radio.
[02:55:40.397 --> 02:55:41.118]  Nothing can stop you.
[02:55:41.138 --> 02:55:42.259]  Just make it part of your daily life.
[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:46.122]  Let's talk to John in Boston.
[02:55:46.182 --> 02:55:47.783]  John in Boston, Massachusetts.
[02:55:47.803 --> 02:55:48.383]  Thanks for calling.
[02:55:48.403 --> 02:55:48.864]  You're on the air.
[02:55:50.205 --> 02:55:51.786]  Alex, it is so good to be with you.
[02:55:51.846 --> 02:55:58.851]  The last time I spoke to you was the day of the State of the Union when I said that Trump should declassify the Nunes memo and go out there and read it.
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:09.584]  Um, you know, last season of Homeland, they really tried to drive the point home of the character that's supposed to be like you, being a nut, and really who's a coward, and it was fake news.
[02:56:09.624 --> 02:56:12.326]  So they've been trying to set this up for everybody.
[02:56:12.446 --> 02:56:13.126]  Oh, exactly!
[02:56:13.146 --> 02:56:16.607]  They've had like 10 TV shows where they admit it's supposedly me and I'm a bad guy.
[02:56:17.868 --> 02:56:18.388]  Exactly!
[02:56:20.389 --> 02:56:25.011]  What we really need to do for you, Alex, is your listeners and supporters and InfoWarriors
[02:56:25.541 --> 02:56:35.508]  Is we need to start a hashtag, something like, who is Alex Jones, where we can counter the narrative of the straw man and go out there and support you and show who you really are.
[02:56:35.808 --> 02:56:37.109]  I agree because it's bigger than me.
[02:56:37.129 --> 02:56:38.850]  I mean, I'm already signed on to this, whatever.
[02:56:38.890 --> 02:56:41.632]  I don't care what they say or do about me, but it's reflected on everybody now.
[02:56:42.093 --> 02:56:55.022]  If people could say, Alex predicted this and was right, he was predicted that and was right, and just say, here's the real Alex Jones, maybe a hashtag, real Alex Jones, and then explain to everybody that, I mean, yeah, that's why they're so scared is we've got their game plan.
[02:56:56.553 --> 02:57:00.134]  Because they're going to try something and they're going to try to blame it on you, just like you said.
[02:57:00.194 --> 02:57:02.535]  So we need to get out in front of this as your listeners.
[02:57:02.975 --> 02:57:03.955]  You know, we support you.
[02:57:03.995 --> 02:57:04.716]  I'm praying for you.
[02:57:04.776 --> 02:57:06.656]  Listen, I support you.
[02:57:06.696 --> 02:57:07.577]  John, I'm not saying this.
[02:57:07.637 --> 02:57:08.817]  You are the info war brother.
[02:57:10.197 --> 02:57:11.138]  Hey, I appreciate it.
[02:57:11.178 --> 02:57:12.018]  We're in this together.
[02:57:12.774 --> 02:57:16.035]  Um, you know, I just got a new shipment of, you know, your deodorant.
[02:57:16.075 --> 02:57:17.476]  My wife won't use anything else.
[02:57:17.616 --> 02:57:20.196]  Floralife, you know, uh, B12.
[02:57:20.697 --> 02:57:25.658]  I got t-shirts, everything, because I really, you know, want to be a part of this fight, and I love you, man.
[02:57:26.038 --> 02:57:26.558]  I love you.
[02:57:26.578 --> 02:57:30.700]  Let me tell you, when I ask the listeners for support and I say you're the InfoWarp, you are it.
[02:57:30.800 --> 02:57:31.380]  You don't understand.
[02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:32.640]  It's like, and I'm not just saying that.
[02:57:32.981 --> 02:57:34.001]  Without you, we're gone.
[02:57:34.621 --> 02:57:34.981]  We're gone.
[02:57:35.021 --> 02:57:36.162]  I don't even care about what happens to me now.
[02:57:36.262 --> 02:57:40.103]  I want to beat these globalists and Hillary and Soros, and we're gonna do it.
[02:57:41.343 --> 02:57:43.585]  Even if I don't make it through this, we're gonna make it through.
[02:57:43.645 --> 02:57:44.626]  Let's stay with us.
[02:57:44.646 --> 02:57:45.767]  We'll be back with the 4th Hour.
[02:57:45.807 --> 02:57:46.587]  Paul Watson coming up.
[02:57:46.807 --> 02:57:47.708]  Spread the live links.
[02:57:49.590 --> 02:57:52.972]  Trump is representing America, like he's for the United States.
[02:57:53.733 --> 02:57:55.514]  I am so sorry, sir.
[02:57:55.534 --> 02:57:56.535]  I tried to stop him.
[02:57:56.655 --> 02:57:57.476]  Not your fault.
[02:57:57.576 --> 02:58:00.939]  A face-top of a man who jumped 36 greyhounds end-to-end.
[02:58:01.019 --> 02:58:02.039]  It's all right, missus.
[02:58:02.099 --> 02:58:04.241]  I'll do this for you.
[02:58:05.422 --> 02:58:07.063]  Yes.
[02:58:07.083 --> 02:58:07.444]  Mr. Banks.
[02:58:08.894 --> 02:58:11.775]  Do you know what Chuck Berry said every night before counting 1, 2, 3, 4?
[02:58:12.215 --> 02:58:15.776]  What did he say?
[02:58:16.136 --> 02:58:16.877]  Pay me my money!
[02:58:18.337 --> 02:58:20.918]  Well, I'm sure my people will be in cash.
[02:58:21.238 --> 02:58:29.321]  And on top of that, Germany is just paying a little bit over 1%, whereas the United States in actual numbers is paying 4.2% of a much larger GDP.
[02:58:33.949 --> 02:58:41.314]  You know, we're protecting Germany, we're protecting France, we're protecting everybody, and yet we're paying a lot of money to protect.
[02:58:41.334 --> 02:58:43.315]  Now, this has been going on for decades.
[02:58:43.976 --> 02:58:51.601]  This has been brought up by other presidents, but other presidents never did anything about it because I don't think they understood it or they just didn't want to get involved.
[02:58:52.522 --> 02:58:55.504]  But I have to bring it up because I think it's very unfair to our country.
[02:58:55.544 --> 02:58:57.085]  It's very unfair to our taxpayers.
[02:58:58.085 --> 02:59:02.749]  And I think that these countries have to step it up, not over a 10 year period, they have to step it up immediately.
[02:59:03.109 --> 02:59:04.410]  Germany is a rich country.
[02:59:04.910 --> 02:59:08.353]  They talk about they're going to increase it a tiny bit by 2030.
[02:59:10.194 --> 02:59:14.678]  Well, they could increase it immediately tomorrow and have no problem.
[02:59:14.918 --> 02:59:16.639]  I don't think it's fair to the United States.
[02:59:16.699 --> 02:59:20.422]  So we're going to have to do something because we're not going to put up with it.
[02:59:20.482 --> 02:59:21.422]  We can't put up with it.
[02:59:21.583 --> 02:59:23.264]  And it's inappropriate.
[02:59:27.153 --> 02:59:30.154]  Would you support a group that uses racial slurs like the n-word?
[02:59:31.175 --> 02:59:35.776]  Would you support a group that hits women and disabled veterans and attacks minorities and transgenders?
[02:59:36.357 --> 02:59:39.158]  Would you support a group that intimidates the public with weapons of war?
[02:59:39.718 --> 02:59:43.540]  What if that same group had been caught lobbying explosives into a crowd of innocent people?
[02:59:44.160 --> 02:59:45.200]  I wouldn't support that group.
[02:59:45.500 --> 02:59:45.801]  Would you?
[02:59:45.821 --> 02:59:48.702]  This has been a public service announcement from InfoWars.com.
[02:59:51.983 --> 02:59:57.947]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[03:00:11.875 --> 03:00:18.399]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:25.620 --> 03:00:35.744]  I hate censorship.
[03:00:36.544 --> 03:00:37.305]  I love truth.
[03:00:38.685 --> 03:00:40.786]  We're able to divert to a server for now.
[03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:49.602]  It has a splash page that diverts folks to newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.com has been attacked.
[03:00:49.662 --> 03:00:50.663]  People don't want to get into this.
[03:00:50.703 --> 03:00:53.984]  We have denial of service attacks, DDoS attacks, that's been going on for weeks.
[03:00:54.684 --> 03:01:01.766]  But this is people inside origin servers, we believe, that have flipped it off.
[03:01:02.126 --> 03:01:06.608]  So this is the rebellion level and a test case ahead of the midterms, I believe,
[03:01:07.748 --> 03:01:11.374]  Just like YouTube four or five months ago took us down and said, oh, there was a rebellion.
[03:01:11.794 --> 03:01:12.435]  They were wrong.
[03:01:12.475 --> 03:01:13.297]  They were untrained.
[03:01:13.337 --> 03:01:13.898]  They took you down.
[03:01:13.938 --> 03:01:18.124]  It wasn't true what you said, because we could put up the real video, what I said versus what they said.
[03:01:18.865 --> 03:01:20.167]  But they finally made the decision.
[03:01:21.368 --> 03:01:26.611]  Eight days ago, nine days ago, with the head of Apple and others to take us down, and then like dominoes it happened.
[03:01:26.951 --> 03:01:29.052]  Paul, gut level, what do you think's going on?
[03:01:29.092 --> 03:01:31.453]  Because we're important, but not that important.
[03:01:32.213 --> 03:01:33.154]  We're a test case.
[03:01:33.254 --> 03:01:37.096]  This is seeing if Congress and the President notice, oh, they're worried about Amorosa.
[03:01:37.136 --> 03:01:39.397]  This is never before happened.
[03:01:39.417 --> 03:01:50.803]  The de-platforming off 25 platforms, going after our credit card processors, going after our email systems, going after our servers that aren't even servers for web, servers for inventory.
[03:01:51.323 --> 03:01:52.704]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[03:01:54.164 --> 03:01:56.626]  Well, it's nothing more than a cyber attack, Alex, isn't it?
[03:01:56.706 --> 03:01:59.087]  It's full on cyber warfare.
[03:01:59.487 --> 03:02:09.492]  And of course, we have to trace it back to the origins, which was a CNN campaign in association with BuzzFeed, I might add, to lobby these big tech firms to censor info wars.
[03:02:09.512 --> 03:02:10.793]  Then it snowballed from there.
[03:02:11.133 --> 03:02:13.054]  Now it's literally cyber attacking our website.
[03:02:13.390 --> 03:02:20.355]  You know they all said when this began over a week ago, oh Alex Jones isn't being censored, you know, private companies can do what they like.
[03:02:20.836 --> 03:02:27.260]  Alex Jones still has his own website and in fact even Joe Rogan, God bless him, but even Joe Rogan said that.
[03:02:27.641 --> 03:02:31.924]  Well now we don't even have our own website because of what is obviously a cyber attack.
[03:02:31.964 --> 03:02:33.445]  We didn't have email or comments!
[03:02:33.485 --> 03:02:34.666]  They're taking everything!
[03:02:36.351 --> 03:02:39.954]  Yeah, so it's not just private companies making decisions.
[03:02:40.014 --> 03:02:45.840]  This is for political persecution, cyber warfare, and the people behind it are going to be exposed.
[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:49.723]  There's also this whole narrative that we hear from CNN every single day.
[03:02:50.124 --> 03:02:51.505]  There's a war on the press!
[03:02:51.605 --> 03:02:54.047]  Oh my God, there's a war on the press being led by Donald Trump.
[03:02:54.328 --> 03:02:55.629]  There's no war on the press.
[03:02:55.869 --> 03:02:57.050]  There's no war on the cause.
[03:02:57.070 --> 03:02:59.973]  The universities and press are waging war on the First Amendment.
[03:03:00.774 --> 03:03:01.214]  Exactly.
[03:03:01.314 --> 03:03:04.217]  That's the real war on independent journalists.
[03:03:04.277 --> 03:03:11.402]  Because mainstream journalists don't do journalism anymore, they just lobby big corporations to shut down their competition and call it journalism.
[03:03:11.742 --> 03:03:18.207]  The war is on independent journalists, people like Laura Loomer, who was shut down the other day for doing independent journalism.
[03:03:18.787 --> 03:03:21.589]  Okie for everyone else who actually get original stories.
[03:03:21.609 --> 03:03:22.550]  The war is on them.
[03:03:22.910 --> 03:03:32.556]  The war is on non-corporate news outlets that don't take giant fat checks from George Soros or get paid for advertising by dictatorships in the Middle East like CNN does.
[03:03:33.399 --> 03:03:41.561]  The war is on the people who are being censored and banned every single day by these legacy media companies, which were dying and losing their audience.
[03:03:41.601 --> 03:03:49.864]  So they concerted, they colluded, they conspired with big tech, with giant corporations in Silicon Valley to shut down their competition.
[03:03:49.884 --> 03:03:50.784]  Well, let me ask you this.
[03:03:51.304 --> 03:03:52.825]  This is next level, though.
[03:03:54.945 --> 03:03:58.046]  Doing denial of service, but now people inside shutting this off somewhere.
[03:03:58.086 --> 03:03:59.786]  Because we're looking, this is like flipped off.
[03:03:59.826 --> 03:04:01.367]  This is like, it's just turned off.
[03:04:03.053 --> 03:04:06.003]  I think it's a precursor to what they're going to do to Trump.
[03:04:06.284 --> 03:04:08.752]  I think we're going to see industrial sabotage nationwide, Paul.
[03:04:10.327 --> 03:04:11.247]  That's exactly what it is.
[03:04:11.307 --> 03:04:11.948]  It's sabotage.
[03:04:11.988 --> 03:04:17.589]  And this is why the administration, people around the administration, need to speak out on this immediately.
[03:04:17.930 --> 03:04:22.131]  I mean, there was one Trump tweet about Twitter shadow banning a couple of weeks ago.
[03:04:22.631 --> 03:04:24.412]  That actually had somewhat of an effect.
[03:04:24.452 --> 03:04:31.494]  Twitter's now come out, whether you believe them or not, at least we're still on Twitter, and said they're launching a charm offensive with conservatives to talk to them.
[03:04:31.934 --> 03:04:34.055]  So, you know, it had some impact there.
[03:04:34.095 --> 03:04:36.836]  Let's see what they're going to do next, because they need to do something.
[03:04:37.324 --> 03:04:39.646]  My God, this is so epic and so historical.
[03:04:40.748 --> 03:04:43.731]  It means we're doing our job, but I just can't believe they're trying.
[03:04:43.751 --> 03:04:50.077]  I mean, now InfoWars.com is down, NewsWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are still up.
[03:04:50.197 --> 03:04:51.398]  Europe Wars was down earlier.
[03:04:51.679 --> 03:04:52.620]  It's on a different server.
[03:04:52.960 --> 03:04:54.081]  Our sites don't go down, folks.
[03:04:54.101 --> 03:04:55.322]  We have the big fancy stuff.
[03:04:55.343 --> 03:04:57.124]  I mean, they are hitting us hard.
[03:04:57.244 --> 03:04:58.386]  Please, please spread the word.
[03:05:00.325 --> 03:05:04.007]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[03:05:04.148 --> 03:05:09.211]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[03:05:09.391 --> 03:05:10.552]  And here's the best part.
[03:05:10.692 --> 03:05:12.313]  It is absolutely free.
[03:05:12.533 --> 03:05:17.496]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[03:05:17.757 --> 03:05:21.599]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app app.
[03:05:21.619 --> 03:05:25.602]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point blank range.
[03:05:25.822 --> 03:05:29.965]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[03:05:33.709 --> 03:05:34.690]  Hey, have you heard?
[03:05:35.151 --> 03:05:37.253]  InfoWars is getting banned across the internet.
[03:05:37.313 --> 03:05:38.614]  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter.
[03:05:38.755 --> 03:05:39.836]  They're all censoring us.
[03:05:40.196 --> 03:05:46.083]  I need you to share these links to the videos and the websites and the stories at InfoWars.com immediately.
[03:05:46.403 --> 03:05:49.427]  And remember, if you can hear my voice, you are the revolution.
[03:06:11.283 --> 03:06:16.457]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[03:06:16.938 --> 03:06:19.304]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:06:34.782 --> 03:06:36.724]  Paul Watson is hosting this show.
[03:06:36.744 --> 03:06:38.025]  He's about to take over as a special guest.
[03:06:38.046 --> 03:06:40.628]  He'll take a few calls in the segment before I leave you.
[03:06:41.009 --> 03:06:43.091]  The war room's coming up in about 50 minutes.
[03:06:44.733 --> 03:06:48.578]  Paul, we were talking during the break about how desperate the deep state and the global are.
[03:06:48.598 --> 03:06:50.179]  This is a very bold move.
[03:06:51.161 --> 03:06:57.722]  To de-platform us, a bunch of other libertarians, conservatives, and then to internally take down our sites.
[03:06:58.362 --> 03:07:00.003]  And I know I got a bunch of inside baseball.
[03:07:00.023 --> 03:07:01.263]  I'm not going to name companies yet.
[03:07:01.683 --> 03:07:04.943]  It's about the companies admit, no, this is not an official decision and stop.
[03:07:05.483 --> 03:07:08.964]  Where it's not just de-platforming, it's saying software we pay for, we can't use.
[03:07:09.304 --> 03:07:13.905]  This is literally trying to put us into an electronic gulag that Drudge Report warned about.
[03:07:13.925 --> 03:07:16.845]  There's now a story up on newswars.com.
[03:07:16.985 --> 03:07:20.166]  Infowars.com site goes down amid big tech censorship.
[03:07:21.317 --> 03:07:23.619]  And so we got a splash page up on another server.
[03:07:23.639 --> 03:07:24.720]  I'm told it's having problems.
[03:07:26.621 --> 03:07:30.224]  This is like something out of a movie or you read about as a kid in a science fiction book.
[03:07:30.705 --> 03:07:32.186]  What do you think's going on, Watson?
[03:07:33.902 --> 03:07:41.708]  Well obviously you've got mob outrage witch hunts who have been called to the cause by basically big tech.
[03:07:41.728 --> 03:07:52.536]  You remember Zuckerberg said, oh first we need to establish whether this is just brigading, whether this is mobs of people politically demanding we take down Infowars for partisanship reasons.
[03:07:52.936 --> 03:07:55.819]  It obviously was from the very start but he said, oh no it's not that.
[03:07:56.279 --> 03:07:57.040]  Now this is that.
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:08:02.564]  This is witch hunt brigades radicalised by mainstream media propaganda.
[03:08:03.084 --> 03:08:04.906]  And now they're trying to take down the website.
[03:08:05.226 --> 03:08:13.835]  You know, they've had fundraisers for people like Tommy Robinson in the past, and the banks get pressured not to even open account so you can fundraise.
[03:08:14.075 --> 03:08:18.840]  So they literally target people to make them not allowed to have bank accounts.
[03:08:19.280 --> 03:08:23.084]  They delisted you from LinkedIn, which is a pure un-persona.
[03:08:23.104 --> 03:08:25.206]  You don't even upload any content to LinkedIn.
[03:08:25.246 --> 03:08:26.307]  It's impossible to do so.
[03:08:26.767 --> 03:08:27.928]  But this is all about power.
[03:08:28.189 --> 03:08:29.510]  This is all about sabotage.
[03:08:29.850 --> 03:08:32.052]  I mean, what don't they want people to see, Alex?
[03:08:32.373 --> 03:08:35.916]  What's happening in Sweden last night, which got banned on Facebook, by the way?
[03:08:36.296 --> 03:08:41.421]  Videos of these migrant mobs, these youth gangs, torching vehicles in numerous different cities.
[03:08:41.761 --> 03:08:42.022]  Okay?
[03:08:42.042 --> 03:08:50.610]  They don't want people to see that because then people will vote for the parties, the anti-globalist parties, that will see to that and, you know, offer actual solutions.
[03:08:51.610 --> 03:08:52.471]  It's not working.
[03:08:52.811 --> 03:08:56.374]  The Sweden Democrats and the elections next month are five points ahead.
[03:08:56.635 --> 03:08:58.716]  They're probably going to win if there's no election meddling.
[03:08:59.097 --> 03:09:02.199]  So whatever they do, they can't keep a lid on this stuff.
[03:09:02.540 --> 03:09:05.943]  And by censoring us and attacking us, it only draws more attention to it.
[03:09:06.363 --> 03:09:08.165]  But they are completely without morals.
[03:09:08.205 --> 03:09:11.808]  They moral grandstand all day and say, oh, we're just enforcing terms of service.
[03:09:12.128 --> 03:09:19.530]  There was a left-wing Latin American news website, which was basically Venezuelan socialist propaganda.
[03:09:19.870 --> 03:09:23.130]  They took that down on Facebook just last night.
[03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:25.911]  So, you know, they all cheered when they took down Infowars.
[03:09:25.951 --> 03:09:30.172]  Are you going to celebrate and cheer when these left-wing websites start getting taken down?
[03:09:30.232 --> 03:09:34.673]  And the answer, from what I've seen, is yes, they will, because they're complete hypocrites.
[03:09:34.693 --> 03:09:39.414]  Well, what it is is people groveling to the deep state big mega titan companies.
[03:09:39.974 --> 03:09:40.354]  Power.
[03:09:41.354 --> 03:09:43.355]  A bunch of powerless people seeking after power.
[03:09:43.375 --> 03:09:48.176]  But as you said, a truck attack running over more people at Parliament.
[03:09:49.237 --> 03:09:53.038]  They find a Muslim training camp and people call in saying there's a dead kid there.
[03:09:53.098 --> 03:09:53.919]  There is a dead kid.
[03:09:53.939 --> 03:09:55.339]  They go, but it's racist.
[03:09:55.719 --> 03:09:56.439]  So they let him go.
[03:09:56.459 --> 03:09:57.540]  There's a dead kid there.
[03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:01.443]  And, you know, all this is going, they say, well, it's racist, your Muslims will let you go.
[03:10:02.124 --> 03:10:09.431]  CNN won't even say it's Islamic attacks happening in Sweden, even though, as you said, they're running around screaming Allah Akbar, burning now thousands of cars.
[03:10:10.252 --> 03:10:11.993]  And Sweden's answer is bring in more Muslims.
[03:10:12.454 --> 03:10:13.795]  Where does all this end, Paul?
[03:10:15.957 --> 03:10:20.181]  Well, it ends in the instability, the destabilization of society.
[03:10:20.722 --> 03:10:22.704]  If you try and drive these
[03:10:23.186 --> 03:10:26.650]  You know, fringe voices, which are not even fringe at this point, underground.
[03:10:26.690 --> 03:10:28.151]  You only make the situation worse.
[03:10:28.191 --> 03:10:29.653]  You only make people more resentful.
[03:10:29.993 --> 03:10:44.668]  This attack in London today, the first narrative they came out with was that this was Boris Johnson's fault because he had written an article saying, by the way, I don't think the burqa should be banned, but these people wearing it don't fit in with our culture.
[03:10:44.688 --> 03:10:46.330]  Basically, they look like letterboxes.
[03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:51.632]  Now they're tweeting today that it's his fault, because he whipped up hatred and division.
[03:10:51.892 --> 03:10:53.432]  Remember, this is why we got banned, apparently.
[03:10:53.752 --> 03:10:55.253]  He whipped up hatred and division.
[03:10:55.653 --> 03:11:05.076]  So they're literally siding with the ideology that justified the Charlie Hebdo attack by saying, oh, these Muslims were offended, so they have the right to violate it.
[03:11:05.096 --> 03:11:05.676]  And it gets worse.
[03:11:05.936 --> 03:11:08.377]  Some tourists took a selfie of the police cars and stuff.
[03:11:08.777 --> 03:11:12.979]  That was the outrage that they did that, not another Islamist that's running over people.
[03:11:13.539 --> 03:11:18.324]  I mean, this is, they're bending over backwards, but the Islamicists are getting more and more violent.
[03:11:18.364 --> 03:11:21.388]  Why do you think they burned down so much of Sweden last night?
[03:11:23.290 --> 03:11:25.793]  Well, Sweden's had these problems for years and years.
[03:11:25.853 --> 03:11:30.378]  I mean, the mail companies, some of them have refused to even deliver to certain areas now.
[03:11:30.985 --> 03:11:34.128]  So, I mean, it helps the Sweden Democrats, let's be honest.
[03:11:34.148 --> 03:11:35.629]  They'll probably start saying that they did it.
[03:11:35.649 --> 03:11:39.393]  I mean, they've tried to... Mr. McClure, that's the pro-nationalist group, you know, obviously.
[03:11:39.413 --> 03:11:42.215]  But why do the Islamists just not get jobs?
[03:11:42.275 --> 03:11:43.296]  Why do they not integrate?
[03:11:43.416 --> 03:11:44.677]  Why are they just so hateful?
[03:11:46.259 --> 03:11:51.223]  Well, in Sweden, I think it's the majority of people in Sweden on welfare are migrants.
[03:11:51.243 --> 03:11:52.705]  Most of those are Muslim migrants.
[03:11:52.785 --> 03:11:55.107]  But it's because they live in these closed communities.
[03:11:55.700 --> 03:11:58.261]  And they're on welfare, and they don't feel the need to learn English.
[03:11:58.301 --> 03:12:08.683]  I mean, they went round Bradford, which is a northern UK city, a couple of weeks ago with Sky News, and they were asking Muslims wearing full burqas, what does it mean to you to be British?
[03:12:09.263 --> 03:12:11.423]  And they answered, I don't understand English.
[03:12:11.763 --> 03:12:16.384]  So they cannot even respond to the question of what does it mean to be British.
[03:12:16.404 --> 03:12:18.065]  But they know how to have chips on their shoulders.
[03:12:18.145 --> 03:12:19.185]  I'm going to let you take over.
[03:12:19.845 --> 03:12:20.785]  I got to a lot of callers.
[03:12:20.845 --> 03:12:21.685]  Sorry to the other callers.
[03:12:22.046 --> 03:12:23.186]  I may have time to get to one here.
[03:12:24.206 --> 03:12:25.187]  Financial support, folks.
[03:12:25.247 --> 03:12:26.288]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:12:26.668 --> 03:12:27.689]  This is total war.
[03:12:27.830 --> 03:12:29.651]  Thousands of articles a day saying, shut us down.
[03:12:29.912 --> 03:12:30.753]  George Soros Hillary.
[03:12:30.813 --> 03:12:32.775]  If you'll just buy some products.
[03:12:32.835 --> 03:12:34.036]  Great fluoride-free toothpaste.
[03:12:34.056 --> 03:12:35.117]  Fortified colonel silver iodine.

[03:12:36.859 --> 03:12:38.320]  Bunch of other products.
[03:12:38.340 --> 03:12:39.822]  Get water filtration, air filtration.
[03:12:40.262 --> 03:12:40.582]  X2.
[03:12:40.642 --> 03:12:41.463]  Everybody needs this.
[03:12:41.503 --> 03:12:43.505]  Just make the decision to get in the war.
[03:12:43.866 --> 03:12:44.626]  To get in the fight.
[03:12:45.546 --> 03:12:46.626]  And we will defeat all this.
[03:12:47.006 --> 03:12:50.407]  I'm going to go on at the end no matter what happens, but I tell you, we need a lot of capital right now.

[03:13:09.612 --> 03:13:12.796]  We've got Aaron asking, what's the mechanics of the attack?
[03:13:12.896 --> 03:13:13.977]  Insiders shut us off.
[03:13:14.338 --> 03:13:16.480]  Fernando asks, the severity of censorship.
[03:13:16.900 --> 03:13:19.844]  Stefan in Pennsylvania, how the plan of combating censorship?
[03:13:19.864 --> 03:13:20.645]  I mean, how do we do it?
[03:13:21.005 --> 03:13:21.906]  Get Congress acting.
[03:13:21.926 --> 03:13:24.869]  A bigger plan besides censorship.
[03:13:24.929 --> 03:13:26.451]  Let's talk to Kevin in Virginia.
[03:13:26.751 --> 03:13:29.374]  Kevin, what's the bigger plan beyond censorship?
[03:13:29.414 --> 03:13:30.295]  You're on with Paul Watson.
[03:13:30.315 --> 03:13:30.596]  Go ahead.
[03:13:31.618 --> 03:13:37.103]  Well, I think this bigger plan of censorship ahead of the midterms has nothing to do with the midterms.
[03:13:37.383 --> 03:13:44.569]  I think it has to do with shutting down the opposition and the dissent of this event, of whatever's about to happen.
[03:13:45.109 --> 03:13:45.770]  No, I agree.
[03:13:45.910 --> 03:13:56.499]  I think the big terror attack or false flag they're getting ready to stage, that they're pumping, that'll be against the media or the tech companies, they don't want us on air when they stage it to create their big sympathy thing.
[03:13:56.519 --> 03:13:56.799]  Go ahead.
[03:13:57.935 --> 03:13:58.755]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:13:59.415 --> 03:14:02.196]  You know, remember this, remember this.
[03:14:02.816 --> 03:14:07.198]  The people that did 9-11, these people don't have empathy.
[03:14:07.598 --> 03:14:10.639]  By the way, that's Brennan and all these guys were involved in 9-11.
[03:14:10.659 --> 03:14:11.999]  Mueller, all of them.
[03:14:12.899 --> 03:14:13.999]  Yeah, they don't have empathy.
[03:14:14.119 --> 03:14:23.722]  They're going to do whatever it is they can do because they have no, what's the word, they have no remorse and they have no, they don't know what consequences are.
[03:14:24.302 --> 03:14:26.523]  That's why these people do the things that they do.
[03:14:27.085 --> 03:14:28.006]  How do you fight that?
[03:14:28.426 --> 03:14:30.267]  Well, you gotta take them out.
[03:14:32.208 --> 03:14:32.748]  It's time.
[03:14:33.068 --> 03:14:34.609]  It is time for us to rise up.
[03:14:35.230 --> 03:14:35.710]  It is time.
[03:14:36.994 --> 03:14:41.377]  Well, I'm not going to call for offensive violence, but you know when they stage stuff, there'll be some innocent cops or whatever.
[03:14:41.838 --> 03:14:51.445]  I think Soros, these globalists, all these people are clear and present dangers, and I just pray that America and the world wake up to them, and I appreciate your call, Kevin, but they're coming for us.
[03:14:51.545 --> 03:14:53.567]  Antifa's calling for violence, the media's covering it up.
[03:14:53.947 --> 03:14:56.569]  Paul, gut level, do you think a big event's coming?
[03:14:56.589 --> 03:14:57.730]  I think they're clearly hyping one.
[03:14:59.986 --> 03:15:02.729]  I don't know if the big event is the midterm elections, Alex.
[03:15:02.749 --> 03:15:04.750]  That's the biggest event that's coming in the next few months.
[03:15:05.131 --> 03:15:14.960]  But just harking back to the arrogance of it all, Zuckerberg, you know, unclear whether it's him or one of his executives in Facebook, saying, we will help you revitalise journalism.
[03:15:15.200 --> 03:15:19.584]  In a few years, the reverse looks like, are they holding hands with your dying business, like in a hospice?
[03:15:19.924 --> 03:15:25.988]  The sheer arrogance of these people, given that Facebook loses 3 million users in the U.S.
[03:15:26.068 --> 03:15:27.909]  alone every year under the age of 25, okay?
[03:15:27.969 --> 03:15:31.352]  They're going to end up like the next MySpace anyway.
[03:15:31.712 --> 03:15:35.194]  So the solution is to continue to erode their reputation and call them out.
[03:15:35.214 --> 03:15:40.758]  And that's why they're making their move against Real Choice, because they're dying, they're a fraud, and Zuckerberg thinks you're a bunch of dumb effers.
[03:15:41.038 --> 03:15:41.498]  Great job.
[03:15:41.839 --> 03:15:44.601]  PrisonPlanet.com, NewsWars.com for Now's Up.
[03:15:45.061 --> 03:15:46.041]  They're going to test us now.
[03:15:46.082 --> 03:15:47.362]  They think, hey, take down his website.
[03:15:47.382 --> 03:15:48.283]  Will they get upset about that?
[03:15:48.763 --> 03:15:49.364]  Are you upset?
[03:15:49.904 --> 03:15:51.785]  Because let me tell you, this is a real canary in the coal mine.
[03:15:51.905 --> 03:15:52.585]  InfoWars.
[03:15:52.966 --> 03:15:57.608]  Now, take him down by some mole inside a server operation, we believe.
[03:15:59.469 --> 03:16:00.389]  We knew it was coming.
[03:16:00.409 --> 03:16:01.990]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:16:02.270 --> 03:16:15.517]  First, demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a straw man, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:16:16.398 --> 03:16:17.118]  And then, voila!
[03:16:18.390 --> 03:16:28.448]  Two weeks later, banned InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top 5 or top 10 news feeds.
[03:16:30.554 --> 03:16:30.975]  Let's
[03:16:48.971 --> 03:16:59.397]  To then go mass flag us in the community guidelines, which again is something out of 1984 or a Kafka novel, where you don't even know what you've supposedly done.
[03:16:59.617 --> 03:17:00.938]  You can't face your accuser.
[03:17:01.378 --> 03:17:06.501]  Then you get defamed by the claims of the big tech giants when they ban you.
[03:17:07.588 --> 03:17:21.291]  Make no mistake, this is being set up to create a precedent in their own words for you, nationalists, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, people that stand up to the New York Times editorial board member saying whites are subhuman and should be extincted.
[03:17:22.091 --> 03:17:26.572]  This is the agenda they're pushing that is being funded by Communist China.
[03:17:27.252 --> 03:17:29.853]  Out of everything I've broken down so far, that's the key.
[03:17:30.273 --> 03:17:33.994]  Apple has officially moved to China and is letting the government basically run Apple.
[03:17:35.103 --> 03:17:36.124]  And that, of course, is iTunes.
[03:17:36.484 --> 03:17:43.169]  Google is building a huge censorship search engine for them, and whistleblowers from inside Google say they're preparing to use it here in America.
[03:17:44.190 --> 03:17:51.636]  In fact, they're beta testing different parts of the censorship system for China on American conservatives, nationalists, and Trump supporters.
[03:17:52.216 --> 03:17:57.760]  The bigger issue is they don't like InfoWars exposing the fact in great detail.
[03:17:58.741 --> 03:18:11.207]  The Communist China owns our debt, owns and controls Hollywood now, is involved in massive domestic propaganda operations, and is working with the Democratic Party and with the EU and others to try to block the Trump agenda.
[03:18:11.507 --> 03:18:13.088]  They even talk about this at Davos.
[03:18:13.168 --> 03:18:15.509]  So this is 21st century warfare.
[03:18:15.949 --> 03:18:25.214]  It's happening right now, and it's designed to silence the American people and other populist movements around the world who are trying to struggle free from this corporate totalitarianism.
[03:18:25.734 --> 03:18:36.388]  This now becomes the last battle of the Civil War of, you know, Fox, Breitbart, Sinclair, and Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God.
[03:18:36.969 --> 03:18:42.837]  The number one thing you can do past standing up to this and getting informed and informing others is to simply
[03:18:43.698 --> 03:18:46.280]  Go to Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:18:46.701 --> 03:18:48.122]  Subscribe to the free podcast.
[03:18:48.582 --> 03:18:49.383]  Just click on the link.
[03:18:49.623 --> 03:18:52.586]  Whatever you're subscribing your podcast in, it'll pop up there.
[03:18:53.266 --> 03:19:04.636]  It's also critical to go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform that are being censored so you can get them out to others.
[03:19:05.316 --> 03:19:09.100]  But whatever you do, tell folks about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:19:09.580 --> 03:19:12.441]  How they can download the free Android and iPhone apps.
[03:19:12.981 --> 03:19:17.862]  How they can then reach out to others with the information and point out, this is the verboten info.
[03:19:18.102 --> 03:19:19.423]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:19:19.803 --> 03:19:20.443]  You're an adult.
[03:19:20.763 --> 03:19:22.763]  You deserve to hear what all the hubbub's about.
[03:19:23.103 --> 03:19:27.745]  You deserve to hear what the establishment is so desperate to silence so you can make your own decision.
[03:19:28.505 --> 03:19:29.605]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:29.885 --> 03:19:30.745]  Newswars.com.
[03:19:30.945 --> 03:19:32.066]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[03:19:32.406 --> 03:19:32.606]  Listen.
[03:19:33.444 --> 03:19:35.066]  I was never trying to win a popularity contest.
[03:19:35.226 --> 03:19:38.829]  I've been trying to get Americans and others to think outside the box and realize what's happening.
[03:19:39.089 --> 03:19:39.910]  We've been very successful.
[03:19:40.351 --> 03:19:41.552]  I've expected to be attacked.
[03:19:42.092 --> 03:19:44.995]  I didn't know we'd be the very tip of the spear, but it's happened.
[03:19:45.455 --> 03:19:50.280]  So now, Infowars is the banner of free speech, the renaissance in Western culture and civilization.
[03:19:50.620 --> 03:19:58.568]  And it's more important than ever that folks realize that the dominoes are beginning to fall against your cherished free speech, and you'll lose everything else if you don't stand up for it now.
[03:20:03.812 --> 03:20:06.574]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:17.082 --> 03:20:18.023]  You found it!
[03:20:18.323 --> 03:20:19.864]  The tip of the spear!
[03:20:20.384 --> 03:20:22.826]  It is The Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:23.367 --> 03:20:27.330]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson!
[03:20:29.289 --> 03:20:29.809]  We're live.
[03:20:29.970 --> 03:20:36.955]  It is the fourth hour of the most fan-censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere at this point, InfoWars.
[03:20:37.596 --> 03:20:44.481]  And we're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour by Bill Ottman, who is the head on show over at Minds.com, which as far as I know...
[03:20:45.347 --> 03:20:49.669]  It's the biggest old tech social media website in existence right now.
[03:20:50.129 --> 03:20:53.070]  Never has it been needed more than right now.
[03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:58.952]  So we're going to talk to him about big tech censorship, about ways we can fight back at the bottom of the hour.
[03:20:59.352 --> 03:21:03.193]  The other thing I wanted to mention is Alex talked about getting the products to support us.
[03:21:03.213 --> 03:21:04.634]  We're literally being shut down right now.
[03:21:04.674 --> 03:21:05.594]  People said from the start
[03:21:06.420 --> 03:21:08.902]  Oh, Alex Jones still has his free speech.
[03:21:09.322 --> 03:21:10.563]  He isn't being censored.
[03:21:10.603 --> 03:21:11.504]  He isn't being banned.
[03:21:11.764 --> 03:21:13.426]  He still has his own website.
[03:21:13.826 --> 03:21:17.209]  Well, now he doesn't because that's being shut down as well.
[03:21:17.789 --> 03:21:25.395]  Isn't it amazing how they can shift their justifications from minute to minute based on the fact that they've got mob outrage brigades and
[03:21:25.731 --> 03:21:26.392]  We're good to go.
[03:21:45.635 --> 03:21:47.337]  And press the donate button.
[03:21:47.517 --> 03:21:48.919]  Again, it's going to be on Prison Plan.
[03:21:48.939 --> 03:21:51.922]  It's going to be back on InfoWars whenever we get the website back up.
[03:21:51.962 --> 03:21:59.570]  But at the bottom of the articles, there's a section where you can donate directly via PayPal or Visa, and you can do that, and that helps us out too.
[03:21:59.630 --> 03:22:02.713]  So please do that as soon as possible when the website comes back.
[03:22:03.614 --> 03:22:08.279]  For the time being, I'm going to go through this article on Breitbart, which is headlined
[03:22:08.999 --> 03:22:12.742]  Why tech giants aren't the same as Christian bakeries?
[03:22:12.822 --> 03:22:17.686]  Because this is the other non-excuse they try out every single time we're censored.
[03:22:18.086 --> 03:22:29.975]  Oh, if conservatives can refuse service for a gay couple to refuse to bake a gay wedding cake, then why can't Silicon Valley corporate giants de-platform you and silence you forever?
[03:22:30.476 --> 03:22:32.698]  Because the two are really comparable, aren't they?
[03:22:34.379 --> 03:22:37.481]  Now the sub-headline here is Christian bakeries can't kill your business.
[03:22:37.501 --> 03:22:38.262]  This is the key point.
[03:22:39.031 --> 03:22:47.277]  Financial institutions are heavily regulated, in part, because failures on their part affect the livelihoods of so many other people.
[03:22:47.778 --> 03:22:51.841]  Now we get on to the point of import wars being financially attacked.
[03:22:51.861 --> 03:22:53.102]  This is the level it's reached.
[03:22:53.682 --> 03:22:57.665]  If a bank messes up, people can lose years, even decades, of investment.
[03:22:58.165 --> 03:23:03.369]  Social media companies and online payment processors have grown to similar level of influence.
[03:23:04.090 --> 03:23:05.751]  When Facebook tweaked its algorithms,
[03:23:06.291 --> 03:23:08.773]  And this happened back in February, largely without warning.
[03:23:09.153 --> 03:23:14.497]  It cut traffic to even non-political viral website called Little Things by 75%.
[03:23:16.479 --> 03:23:17.240]  Guess what happened?
[03:23:17.600 --> 03:23:19.642]  They had to shut their business down.
[03:23:19.682 --> 03:23:23.244]  They had to lay off a 100-strong workforce.
[03:23:23.565 --> 03:23:30.190]  So when you get deplatformed on social media, if you're reliant on it to that extent, which this website was, thankfully we weren't,
[03:23:30.794 --> 03:23:40.303]  I think there was a study which found about 10% of traffic that came to InfoWars came from social media, so we had it direct mostly, which is how we'd been able to survive.
[03:23:41.095 --> 03:23:50.498]  But in this case, this website, which was non-political, was put out of business along with 100 employees because Facebook tweaked its algorithm, okay?
[03:23:50.718 --> 03:23:56.960]  That is very different from one single Christian bakery refusing to bake a gay wedding cake.
[03:23:57.200 --> 03:24:01.001]  They can go to virtually any other bakery in the town, in the city,
[03:24:01.505 --> 03:24:02.786]  And receive that service.
[03:24:03.206 --> 03:24:13.472]  Once you've banned off Facebook, and YouTube, and Google, and Apple, there are no equivalent services that the free market can provide where you can go, because this is not a free market.
[03:24:13.772 --> 03:24:15.954]  These companies are acting as monopolies.
[03:24:16.194 --> 03:24:23.238]  They're private companies, private giant corporations that control the public discourse, and they need to be broken up.
[03:24:24.139 --> 03:24:25.960]  It's like saying, oh, you know,
[03:24:26.832 --> 03:24:29.913]  This other argument, which is, why don't you just build your own social network?
[03:24:29.953 --> 03:24:31.273]  Because that's so easy, isn't it?
[03:24:31.613 --> 03:24:41.595]  It's like saying if you get cut off from your power supply, if the electricity company cuts off your power supply, people coming to you and saying, why don't you just start your own electricity company?
[03:24:42.155 --> 03:24:43.696]  No, that's not an argument.
[03:24:44.016 --> 03:24:45.836]  You get cut off from your phone service.
[03:24:46.236 --> 03:24:47.816]  Oh, just start your own phone company.
[03:24:48.036 --> 03:24:50.037]  Just start erecting your own phone masts.
[03:24:50.357 --> 03:24:51.577]  That's a solution, isn't it?
[03:24:51.857 --> 03:24:53.037]  No, it isn't a solution.
[03:24:53.258 --> 03:24:54.038]  It's harebrained.
[03:24:54.398 --> 03:24:55.398]  It's pie in the sky.
[03:24:55.970 --> 03:24:59.913]  So these big websites, which were not even political, were put out of business.
[03:25:00.313 --> 03:25:08.938]  Not even through being censored directly by Facebook, but through the algorithm being tweaked, and then that negatively affected their output.
[03:25:09.239 --> 03:25:11.400]  They went out of business, 100 people got laid off.
[03:25:12.281 --> 03:25:14.322]  According to a report by Digidate,
[03:25:15.083 --> 03:25:26.347]  Entire business models built around the distribution of viral content on Facebook were rendered unviable via the platform's rapid shift, and you barely even heard about this when it happened back in February.
[03:25:27.227 --> 03:25:27.947]  Here's another point.
[03:25:28.168 --> 03:25:30.708]  Christian bakeries can't swing an election.
[03:25:31.189 --> 03:25:38.151]  President Trump has begun to take notice of big tech's progressive bias, recently calling out Twitter for shadow-banning prominent Republicans,
[03:25:38.840 --> 03:25:47.162]  And the President's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who managed Trump's social media operations to great success, obviously, in 2016, is also keenly aware of the problem.
[03:25:48.043 --> 03:25:49.023]  As well they should be.
[03:25:49.543 --> 03:25:55.065]  Annoying though biased legacy media like CNN may be, biased social media is a far greater threat.
[03:25:55.485 --> 03:26:02.847]  Facebook claims to have boosted voter turnout by 3% in 2016 by making small tweaks to their algorithm.
[03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:03.800]  Listen to this.
[03:26:04.161 --> 03:26:21.892]  Studies have shown that if search engines like Google manipulated their results to favour political candidates, which we already know, they've manipulated their search results to downrank Conservative websites, they can shift between 2 and 3 million votes in a national election.
[03:26:22.172 --> 03:26:24.494]  In fact, they almost certainly already did in 2016,
[03:26:26.828 --> 03:26:28.189]  In favour of Hillary Clinton.
[03:26:28.289 --> 03:26:30.351]  So how much more could they shift in 2020?
[03:26:31.172 --> 03:26:33.593]  This is why this is so huge.
[03:26:33.894 --> 03:26:36.416]  This is why Trump needs to at least tweet about it.
[03:26:36.696 --> 03:26:38.958]  This is why we need some kind of action in Congress.
[03:26:38.998 --> 03:26:39.758]  We need hearings.
[03:26:40.098 --> 03:26:44.622]  We need lawmakers to sit up and pay attention in the Republican Party.
[03:26:44.902 --> 03:26:46.924]  Otherwise they can forget about the midterms.
[03:26:47.184 --> 03:26:48.665]  They can forget about 2020.
[03:26:49.245 --> 03:26:49.566]  Okay?
[03:26:50.126 --> 03:26:52.248]  When are you going to realise how important this is?
[03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:54.110]  Continues.
[03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:58.412]  Modern elections are won and lost on social media, not legacy media.
[03:26:58.732 --> 03:26:59.893]  Brad Pascale knows this.
[03:26:59.933 --> 03:27:03.654]  He led the digital operations team that outclassed Hillary Clinton in 2016.
[03:27:04.395 --> 03:27:12.458]  The Democrats know this too, which is why they're working so hard to turn social media platforms into little more than conduits for the legacy media.
[03:27:12.898 --> 03:27:14.419]  Which is the point I've made before.
[03:27:14.899 --> 03:27:21.942]  You go back before the beginning of this year and you look at CNN, you look at MSNBC, and these are the mainstream network channels on YouTube.
[03:27:22.322 --> 03:27:29.736]  They were getting their butts handed to them on a regular basis in terms of subscribers and views by independent content creators.
[03:27:30.157 --> 03:27:30.698]  What happened?
[03:27:30.718 --> 03:27:32.121]  YouTube flipped a switch.
[03:27:32.481 --> 03:27:34.826]  They admittedly, and they announced this, they were proud of it,
[03:27:35.583 --> 03:27:43.367]  Deliberately rigged their own algorithm to put mainstream legacy corporate media content above independent media content.
[03:27:43.608 --> 03:27:44.228]  What happened?
[03:27:44.588 --> 03:27:47.690]  CNN subscribers started climbing up rapidly.
[03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:53.793]  Their viewers started climbing up rapidly on YouTube because YouTube, Google, gained the system.
[03:27:54.114 --> 03:27:55.594]  This is why this is so important.
[03:27:55.634 --> 03:27:58.156]  We're all slaves to the algorithm and until these
[03:27:58.743 --> 03:28:04.885]  Fosty Republicans who, you know, have these hearings with Zuckerberg and they don't even know how Facebook makes money.
[03:28:04.965 --> 03:28:07.226]  They don't even know about advertising online.
[03:28:07.926 --> 03:28:23.631]  These people need... it needs to be explained to them how important this can be, given that this can and has shifted mil... They had an example case, and this was Robert Epstein, we've talked about him before, who did a study and found that
[03:28:24.409 --> 03:28:34.559]  Google could shift millions of votes by ranking search results that are positive towards one candidate over another above the one they want to downgrade, the one they want to downvote in the algorithm.
[03:28:35.059 --> 03:28:43.107]  They found that that could shift votes to change the result of the largest democratic election in the world in India.
[03:28:43.647 --> 03:28:47.009]  This is the power that these big tech giants wield.
[03:28:47.289 --> 03:28:49.910]  This is why they need to be broken up right now.
[03:28:50.090 --> 03:28:51.771]  We need action now.
[03:28:51.951 --> 03:28:53.852]  This is completely out of control.
[03:28:53.892 --> 03:28:57.553]  We'll be back with Minds.com's Bill Mossman on the next side.
[03:28:57.913 --> 03:28:58.414]  Stay with us.

[03:30:02.884 --> 03:30:04.185]  The Killing of Uncle Sam.
[03:30:04.265 --> 03:30:05.545]  I just read it a few weeks ago.
[03:30:06.046 --> 03:30:09.167]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown, one of the bravest preachers in the world.
[03:30:09.607 --> 03:30:12.569]  Of course, he's an American, but he grew up in South Africa.
[03:30:12.589 --> 03:30:15.010]  And we're just really, really pleased to have him.
[03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:17.011]  The demise of the United States of America.
[03:30:17.051 --> 03:30:18.692]  Now, he gave us 500 books.
[03:30:18.752 --> 03:30:19.692]  I've ordered 1,000 more.
[03:30:19.712 --> 03:30:20.493]  They're coming in next week.
[03:30:20.533 --> 03:30:22.254]  It starts shipping next Tuesday.
[03:30:22.294 --> 03:30:28.137]  But he does have audiobooks on CD and Audible.com that also start coming out next week.
[03:30:28.157 --> 03:30:29.037]  So we'll be selling those.
[03:30:29.077 --> 03:30:32.479]  But I don't care where you get them, just be sure and
[03:30:32.859 --> 03:30:33.279]  Get them.
[03:30:33.559 --> 03:30:39.481]  I feel in my gut, but also historically, you see this biblically, God gives people one last chance and to turn it around.
[03:30:39.501 --> 03:30:43.162]  So people think, oh, it's Providence, he's divinely inspired, you know, he can't be stopped.
[03:30:43.242 --> 03:30:43.823]  I don't agree with that.
[03:30:43.863 --> 03:30:51.085]  I think if we don't back Trump, if we aren't strong, if we don't pray, if we're not active, if we're not courageous, I think God will step aside and let this whole thing fall.
[03:30:51.365 --> 03:30:52.785]  This is a last minute reprieve.
[03:30:52.845 --> 03:30:59.247]  In actual fact, Dr. Paul Williams, when we were writing this, he said, I want the last chapter to be called the reign of Jezebel.
[03:30:59.627 --> 03:31:01.967]  And I looked at him and said, absolutely not.
[03:31:02.507 --> 03:31:03.208]  Absolutely not.
[03:31:03.288 --> 03:31:04.188]  She's not getting in.
[03:31:04.568 --> 03:31:07.248]  He said, she, she, there's no way she's not going to win.
[03:31:07.588 --> 03:31:09.629]  I said, she is not going to get in.
[03:31:09.989 --> 03:31:13.650]  We've had all night premiums at the church, you know, and I didn't support Trump.
[03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:14.590]  I knew Trump was going to win.
[03:31:14.850 --> 03:31:19.491]  Yeah, I didn't support him as a Republican or Democrat because both Republican and Democrat are wicked.
[03:31:19.611 --> 03:31:24.312]  I supported him because he was an outsider and was not funded by the globalists to come.
[03:31:24.412 --> 03:31:27.793]  And you could see that genuinely the globalists hate him.
[03:31:27.833 --> 03:31:28.213]  In a way.
[03:31:28.433 --> 03:31:29.594]  The Pope is against him.
[03:31:29.974 --> 03:31:32.614]  The world's financial elite in Davos is against him.
[03:31:32.954 --> 03:31:34.255]  The former Mexican...
[03:31:35.495 --> 03:31:38.038]  You know, President is against him, everybody.
[03:31:38.058 --> 03:31:41.342]  I said, okay, well that tells you who we're supposed to support right there.
[03:31:41.442 --> 03:31:43.465]  And I feel that we've got this window.
[03:31:43.845 --> 03:31:46.088]  God has granted us a last minute reprieve.
[03:31:46.388 --> 03:31:47.229]  It's not over yet.
[03:31:47.369 --> 03:31:50.994]  Because let me tell you, back in 07, I said to the Lord, tell me, is it too late?
[03:31:51.815 --> 03:31:52.635]  I mean, it's 07.08.
[03:31:52.736 --> 03:31:53.216]  Is it too late?
[03:31:53.517 --> 03:31:55.098]  I'll tell the people, because I'm not going to lie to them.
[03:31:55.158 --> 03:32:04.409]  I'll tell them, hey, so it's over, and put yourself in the brace position, like they tell you on the aircraft, which is not a good thing, because that means you're trying to get your head as close to your butt.
[03:32:04.449 --> 03:32:05.531]  Put your head between your knees.
[03:32:05.671 --> 03:32:07.173]  You can kiss it goodbye, you know.
[03:32:07.193 --> 03:32:08.634]  It's like, we're going down, you know.
[03:32:09.015 --> 03:32:11.418]  So, you know, the Lord said to me, it's not too late.
[03:32:11.918 --> 03:32:13.339]  And God is waiting on us.
[03:32:13.619 --> 03:32:14.879]  He's waiting on us to stand up.
[03:32:15.239 --> 03:32:18.880]  And I want to just say this, you know, I feel the Lord's hand of protection is on you.
[03:32:19.220 --> 03:32:21.101]  If they were going to take you out, they would have taken you out.
[03:32:21.121 --> 03:32:22.121]  They're not going to touch you.
[03:32:22.421 --> 03:32:28.723]  Because of the blood of Jesus that protects you, the angels of God that encamp about you, your wife, your children, and everything that you touch.
[03:32:28.983 --> 03:32:30.624]  So don't get frustrated.
[03:32:30.664 --> 03:32:32.665]  Know that the Lord, there's a God in heaven.
[03:32:32.985 --> 03:32:34.305]  And you know, He's about you.
[03:32:34.345 --> 03:32:36.146]  He said, I'll be about you as a wall of fire.
[03:32:36.166 --> 03:32:36.886]  I believe it.
[03:32:36.906 --> 03:32:37.266]  I feel it.
[03:32:37.526 --> 03:32:37.666]  Yeah.
[03:32:37.686 --> 03:32:39.047]  I just don't feel like I'm doing good enough.
[03:32:39.087 --> 03:32:39.427]  No, no.
[03:32:39.747 --> 03:32:40.848]  Alex, it's not about that.
[03:32:40.888 --> 03:32:41.708]  You're doing your best.
[03:32:42.008 --> 03:32:42.589]  Here's the thing.
[03:32:42.669 --> 03:32:44.290]  Everybody must do what they can.
[03:32:44.510 --> 03:32:45.911]  Everybody does their best.
[03:32:46.191 --> 03:32:49.312]  And at the end of the day, God takes our best and he multiplies it.
[03:32:49.332 --> 03:32:49.512]  I know.
[03:32:49.553 --> 03:32:50.533]  I can feel God's strength.
[03:32:51.033 --> 03:32:52.734]  I just can't believe that other people don't see it.
[03:32:52.914 --> 03:32:58.017]  Yeah, but that's why I'm going to preach the gospel to them so that they can experience the power of the Holy Spirit.
[03:33:03.340 --> 03:33:05.981]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.926 --> 03:33:26.472]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:26.953 --> 03:33:30.757]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:32.509 --> 03:33:51.474]  We're live in this fourth hour of the most censored broadcast in the Western Hemisphere at this point, and I'm delighted to be joined right now by Bill Oppmann, who is founder of Minds.com, an alternative social media network that doesn't censor, that doesn't shadow ban, and that aligns itself with the First Amendment.
[03:33:51.614 --> 03:33:52.495]  Bill, welcome.
[03:33:53.295 --> 03:33:54.015]  Thanks for having me, Paul.
[03:33:55.356 --> 03:33:57.418]  Now, first off, obviously, I want to get your take on this.
[03:33:57.618 --> 03:34:02.823]  As Infowars.com itself is under cyber attack, they said, oh, Alex Jones isn't being censored.
[03:34:02.843 --> 03:34:04.065]  He still has his own website.
[03:34:04.085 --> 03:34:05.306]  Now he doesn't have his own website.
[03:34:05.366 --> 03:34:05.626]  OK.
[03:34:05.986 --> 03:34:10.691]  But obviously, we've been digitally executed by the social media giants over the past week.
[03:34:11.051 --> 03:34:14.975]  You know, Gavin McInnes banned by Twitter, Laura Loomer banned by Facebook.
[03:34:15.316 --> 03:34:18.739]  Even today, a left-wing Latin American news network
[03:34:19.139 --> 03:34:25.927]  Telecern, which is basically Venezuelan socialist propaganda, even they got banned by Facebook.
[03:34:26.227 --> 03:34:32.334]  Do you think there's anything in the timing about how all this seems to have intensified over the last 10 days or so?
[03:34:33.740 --> 03:34:35.682]  Well, I think it's the key point that you just said.
[03:34:35.722 --> 03:34:38.224]  It's affecting both the left and the right.
[03:34:38.644 --> 03:34:42.807]  And the world needs to understand that censorship affects everyone.
[03:34:42.927 --> 03:34:46.190]  And just because it's not you right now, it doesn't mean it's not going to be you later.
[03:34:46.510 --> 03:34:56.058]  That's why you see, you know, you mentioned Noam Chomsky, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, real internet freedom advocates across the spectrum understand that censorship is not the answer.
[03:34:57.731 --> 03:34:58.111]  Exactly.
[03:34:58.151 --> 03:35:18.622]  We had Noam Chomsky, the preeminent icon basically on the subject of free speech in the West for decades and decades, he's like 89 years old now or something, come out in an email on the weekend and defend InfoWars basically saying that this arbitrary notion of hate speech is just going to end up deep-sixing everyone's right to free speech
[03:35:19.002 --> 03:35:23.287]  You've got CNN right now, if they want to flash up a headline, it's on information liberation.
[03:35:23.688 --> 03:35:26.832]  CNN, Alex Jones' hate speech is a form of terrorism.
[03:35:27.152 --> 03:35:36.304]  They've actually now got a CNN opinion contributor saying that our hate speech, which was nebulous and never defined by any of these companies, is now terrorism.
[03:35:36.324 --> 03:35:37.906]  So now they're going even further.
[03:35:38.406 --> 03:35:43.208]  We've got this whole argument, which we hear again and again, Bill, which I covered in the previous segment.
[03:35:43.568 --> 03:35:47.110]  You know, giant corporations, they're just private companies.
[03:35:47.150 --> 03:35:49.031]  They can enforce their own terms of service.
[03:35:49.311 --> 03:35:50.251]  They can do what they like.
[03:35:50.271 --> 03:35:51.032]  They're private companies.
[03:35:51.272 --> 03:35:54.553]  Well, my argument has always been, no, they're giant corporations.
[03:35:54.573 --> 03:35:57.054]  They're all centered in the same area of San Francisco.
[03:35:57.614 --> 03:35:59.155]  They act like monopolies.
[03:35:59.455 --> 03:36:02.917]  They're private companies, but they control the public discourse.
[03:36:03.277 --> 03:36:05.698]  Studies show they can shift millions of views.
[03:36:06.178 --> 03:36:16.484]  And as we've seen over the past 10 years, they're obviously abusing their power to meddle in elections and silence their political opposition, which, as you said, is just going to end up affecting everyone left or right.
[03:36:17.024 --> 03:36:21.587]  How do you respond to this tiresome argument that they're just private companies that can just do as they wish?
[03:36:23.863 --> 03:36:28.926]  Yeah, the thing is that it amplifies the problems that they're trying to silence.
[03:36:29.446 --> 03:36:39.271]  You would think that with all of the access to analytics and data that they have, they would understand that there are also peer-reviewed studies that show that censorship amplifies whatever it's trying to censor.
[03:36:39.311 --> 03:36:42.913]  This is why, you know, your site is probably growing rapidly right now.
[03:36:42.953 --> 03:36:48.696]  And so what we're calling for at Minds.com is for tech sites across the world to adopt
[03:36:49.415 --> 03:36:57.578]  A free speech policy because then you avoid all of this subjective decision making and inconsistency, which we're seeing on major social networks.
[03:36:57.618 --> 03:37:00.619]  And it's just it's it's it's a losing battle for them.
[03:37:01.959 --> 03:37:08.762]  So you advocate some kind of digital Bill of Rights, which would obviously have to have some kind of state backing.
[03:37:08.782 --> 03:37:15.784]  I mean, some kind of Trump administration backing to at least give it symbolic teeth to outline exactly what free speech rights
[03:37:16.260 --> 03:37:17.601]  People should have on the internet.
[03:37:17.861 --> 03:37:22.463]  And with Minds.com, as far as I understand, you basically align it with the First Amendment, right?
[03:37:22.503 --> 03:37:25.464]  You say anything that's not illegal is fair game.
[03:37:25.484 --> 03:37:26.264]  That's correct, right?
[03:37:27.065 --> 03:37:27.585]  That's correct.
[03:37:29.046 --> 03:37:34.408]  So you're advocating a kind of digital Bill of Rights where it would apply to everyone across the political spectrum?
[03:37:35.205 --> 03:37:37.247]  Yeah, and it makes it easier for tech companies.
[03:37:37.287 --> 03:37:44.112]  I think that they're feeling so much social pressure to censor because of X, Y, and Z reason.
[03:37:44.652 --> 03:37:48.735]  And, you know, Twitter started off as the free, quote unquote, the free speech wing of the free speech party.
[03:37:49.216 --> 03:38:00.124]  And you know that all of the executives are having an existential crisis, which is probably why InfoWars is still on Twitter, because they know if they ban you guys from there, it's just, they're going to lose a huge audience.
[03:38:00.804 --> 03:38:06.228]  And what they're forgetting is that open discourse doesn't mean that you endorse what the people are saying.
[03:38:06.849 --> 03:38:11.012]  Just because you're willing to have a conversation to someone doesn't mean you necessarily agree on all the issues.
[03:38:11.072 --> 03:38:14.695]  So, you know, these digital town halls are supposed to be open forums.
[03:38:15.255 --> 03:38:20.859]  And, you know, regardless of that, this is why we're moving towards more of a decentralized architecture.
[03:38:21.620 --> 03:38:25.683]  We've just integrated a cryptocurrency for our payment system.
[03:38:25.763 --> 03:38:28.065]  So if you check out Mines.com slash token,
[03:38:28.860 --> 03:38:33.585]  You know, we're we don't want to be censored by Stripe or PayPal or any of these other platforms.
[03:38:33.745 --> 03:38:35.167]  Crypto can't get censored.
[03:38:35.207 --> 03:38:40.733]  Granted, you know, it's a new technology, but it's decentralized and it can't get taken down.
[03:38:40.833 --> 03:38:42.815]  So so we're moving more towards that direction.
[03:38:44.560 --> 03:38:51.204]  Now, you mentioned these brigades of mobs that pressure companies into banning people, into banning content.
[03:38:51.244 --> 03:38:52.385]  That's exactly what's happened.
[03:38:52.405 --> 03:39:01.830]  It was ironic, because in the comments that were reported by the New York Times, where they admit Zuckerberg made the decision to pull the plug on InfoWars, he personally made the decision.
[03:39:02.130 --> 03:39:07.653]  So you've literally got billionaires running giant corporations that get to decide what we can see and hear on the internet.
[03:39:07.934 --> 03:39:10.575]  And much of the left applauds and claps and celebrates it.
[03:39:11.035 --> 03:39:12.016]  But you also have him
[03:39:12.463 --> 03:39:22.812]  Apparently, reportedly expressing concern that this whole move to censor info laws could have started by a brigading operation, which we see routinely with groups like Sleeping Giant.
[03:39:22.832 --> 03:39:25.074]  They pressure advertisers to pull out of Breitbart.
[03:39:25.494 --> 03:39:29.538]  And he acknowledged that that was probably what was happening, but then he went ahead and did it anyway.
[03:39:29.958 --> 03:39:34.322]  Now that's happening even to the extent where our website is under cyber attack.
[03:39:34.682 --> 03:39:41.866]  Because of these witch hunt mob brigades, who by the way have basically ruined Twitter and that's why that went down the down the plug hole.
[03:39:42.226 --> 03:39:47.708]  But going back to Minds.com, you know, how do you distinguish yourself from these other old tech networks?
[03:39:47.788 --> 03:39:49.589]  Because there's been a lot that sprung up.
[03:39:49.609 --> 03:39:52.691]  You've got BitTube, for example, which is trying to rival YouTube.
[03:39:52.751 --> 03:39:55.652]  Obviously, they don't have anywhere near the funding, the resources.
[03:39:56.132 --> 03:39:57.193]  How do you differentiate?
[03:39:57.213 --> 03:40:02.595]  How do you distinguish Minds from networks like Gab and others that have also sprung up at the same time?
[03:40:02.615 --> 03:40:03.756]  What makes Minds different?
[03:40:04.984 --> 03:40:13.668]  One of the key differentiators is that all of our software is fully free and open source, which means that anyone can inspect it, modify it, see what it's doing, make sure it's not spying on you.
[03:40:13.788 --> 03:40:17.749]  You can actually clone our entire site if you want to, make your own app.
[03:40:18.189 --> 03:40:21.150]  I think that BitChute is actually going to open source.
[03:40:21.251 --> 03:40:23.952]  I consider this essential.
[03:40:23.972 --> 03:40:29.854]  If there's no transparency, then I'm sorry, you're just following all the proprietary juggernauts.
[03:40:30.294 --> 03:40:33.977]  There has to be a new paradigm of transparency in the software.
[03:40:34.298 --> 03:40:38.582]  Additionally, what you were saying with advertising networks starting to censor, you know, it doesn't make sense.
[03:40:38.622 --> 03:40:41.664]  If you're selling computers, you want to sell computers.
[03:40:42.305 --> 03:40:47.509]  The beliefs of your viewers or whoever you're serving ads on, the viewers need to purchase things.
[03:40:47.569 --> 03:40:51.493]  So this is dangerous precedent in the advertising world.
[03:40:51.533 --> 03:40:54.415]  So we created actually our own ad network that's fully peer-to-peer.
[03:40:54.856 --> 03:40:55.917]  Paul, people could go to your
[03:40:56.657 --> 03:40:59.560]  Mine's channel and send you tokens directly.
[03:40:59.600 --> 03:41:04.184]  They can send you offers of tokens so that you'll advertise their content on your channel.
[03:41:04.484 --> 03:41:14.072]  We're actually trying to take ourselves out of the equation so that creators and users can directly interface with each other and send each other offers for exchange of distribution.
[03:41:15.918 --> 03:41:22.384]  I think I've got about 80,000 followers right now on mine, which all I use it for is basically to send out my own articles.
[03:41:22.424 --> 03:41:24.106]  I don't use it anywhere near as much as Twitter.
[03:41:24.126 --> 03:41:26.928]  Probably will be using it more in the future, given the way that things are going.
[03:41:27.649 --> 03:41:31.292]  But am I correct in saying that you can now host video on there as well?
[03:41:31.312 --> 03:41:32.053]  That's correct, right?
[03:41:32.901 --> 03:41:34.042]  Yeah, we host video.
[03:41:34.202 --> 03:41:36.983]  I mean, look, look at what's happening to all of the networks.
[03:41:37.003 --> 03:41:40.545]  They're sort of becoming the same thing, coalescing into the very similar app.
[03:41:41.566 --> 03:41:43.527]  Every site is becoming a social network.
[03:41:43.587 --> 03:41:52.411]  So, you know, we have groups, we have a whole blogging platform, we host videos, we have news feeds, we have mobile apps on Android and iOS, which you should definitely check out.
[03:41:53.052 --> 03:41:56.594]  And, you know, it's just, it's a race, and we're trying to keep up.
[03:41:56.934 --> 03:42:00.636]  And the fact that we're open source allows developers all over the world to help us
[03:42:01.176 --> 03:42:03.058]  Build the product and make it better.
[03:42:03.598 --> 03:42:13.447]  And, you know, we're just seeing growth just like you guys are because these issues and scandals, whether it's Cambridge Analytica, it's one after the other.
[03:42:13.527 --> 03:42:18.891]  It's just every day there's a new one and it's unbelievable that they're not smart enough to change their behavior.
[03:42:18.911 --> 03:42:20.913]  I don't, doesn't make sense.
[03:42:22.114 --> 03:42:29.200]  By the way, just in 20 seconds, how many new users have you got over the past month since this big tech censorship purge has intensified?
[03:42:29.986 --> 03:42:36.390]  We've seen hundreds of thousands of new users over the last month, even from Vietnam, where there's censorship legislation going through.
[03:42:37.931 --> 03:42:40.452]  Well, people say, oh, just start your own social media network.
[03:42:40.532 --> 03:42:42.573]  It's very impossible, very hard to do so.
[03:42:42.653 --> 03:42:44.974]  Bill Oppmann has done it at Minds.com.
[03:42:45.014 --> 03:42:46.475]  Go there and sign up right now.
[03:42:46.515 --> 03:42:50.898]  We'll be back in the next segment to finish up with Bill and cover the rest of the news.
[03:42:50.918 --> 03:42:52.919]  This is the Alex Jones Show live fourth hour.
[03:42:53.299 --> 03:42:56.641]  InfoWars.com, while it's still up on the internet.
[03:42:57.161 --> 03:42:57.622]  We'll be back.
[03:42:57.662 --> 03:42:58.142]  Now go away.
[03:42:59.261 --> 03:43:02.526]  We knew InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:43:02.566 --> 03:43:04.289]  We're really, really proud of it.
[03:43:04.730 --> 03:43:07.554]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.
[03:43:08.647 --> 03:43:19.690]  And it's got the very best concentrated fibers from berries and fruits and other compounds that have been known to be the very best for your body and for regularity and so much more.
[03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:29.253]  And it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture flora life as well as MycoZx that targets the yeast, the mold, and the funguses in the gut.
[03:43:29.733 --> 03:43:35.301]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product and these other products.
[03:43:35.521 --> 03:43:40.689]  You get them separately or together and make really, really big savings and get high quality products at the same time.
[03:43:40.969 --> 03:43:42.932]  And I'm doing this to introduce these products to you.
[03:43:43.232 --> 03:43:45.255]  Bodies sold out in a month.
[03:43:46.249 --> 03:43:49.311]  Uh, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:43:49.532 --> 03:43:50.913]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:43:51.553 --> 03:43:54.115]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:43:54.856 --> 03:43:56.817]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.
[03:43:57.398 --> 03:43:59.699]  Get yours today in fullwarslife.com.
[03:43:59.920 --> 03:44:00.420]  Look at that.
[03:44:00.440 --> 03:44:04.563]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured.
[03:44:04.603 --> 03:44:05.364]  It's been watered down.
[03:44:05.384 --> 03:44:06.545]  We didn't do that.
[03:44:08.195 --> 03:44:12.316]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[03:44:12.716 --> 03:44:14.376]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:44:14.957 --> 03:44:23.498]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[03:44:23.958 --> 03:44:25.659]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:44:25.699 --> 03:44:26.819]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:44:27.499 --> 03:44:30.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:31.160]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:44:31.920 --> 03:44:34.841]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:44:37.668 --> 03:44:39.010]  Liquid consciousness.
[03:44:42.413 --> 03:44:42.774]  Look it up.
[03:44:43.875 --> 03:44:44.416]  Find out.
[03:44:44.436 --> 03:44:49.882]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:44:49.922 --> 03:44:54.788]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[03:44:55.268 --> 03:44:57.471]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.
[03:44:57.531 --> 03:44:58.352]  M4restore.com.
[03:44:59.465 --> 03:45:03.726]  We need your support in this epic war against censorship.
[03:45:04.526 --> 03:45:19.330]  You have no idea the millions of dollars it will cost Alex Jones and InfoWars to fight the malicious, baseless harassment lawsuits that have been filed against InfoWars across the country.
[03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:24.195]  These stories, these lawsuits have two purposes.
[03:45:24.956 --> 03:45:40.073]  One is to generate vicious negative headlines that can then be cited in turn as the basis for silencing our voices at YouTube, on Facebook, on Twitter, and so on.
[03:45:41.014 --> 03:45:51.361]  It is going to cost literally millions of dollars to fight this Soros-funded onslaught against InfoWars.
[03:45:52.262 --> 03:45:53.903]  We cannot do it alone.
[03:45:54.783 --> 03:46:02.168]  Therefore, I ask you to go to the InfoWars site now and find the location where you can make a contribution.
[03:46:02.669 --> 03:46:05.911]  Go to the donation portion of the site.
[03:46:06.531 --> 03:46:12.135]  And send us $50, or $100, or $250, or $500.
[03:46:13.396 --> 03:46:18.659]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have sent as much as $1,000 or more.
[03:46:19.499 --> 03:46:19.880]  Why?
[03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:25.663]  Because they know that this is the single most important challenge we face.
[03:46:26.704 --> 03:46:41.328]  Whether we win in 2018 and 2020, whether we can keep the new American Revolution going, whether the free ideas expressed here at InfoWars are allowed to continue are really up to you.
[03:46:41.788 --> 03:46:44.209]  The entire question is up to you.
[03:46:44.869 --> 03:46:46.049]  We need your support.
[03:46:46.669 --> 03:46:49.970]  We do not exaggerate the stakes or the dangers.
[03:46:50.390 --> 03:46:51.951]  We are not crying wolf.
[03:46:52.887 --> 03:46:58.255]  Please go to the Infowars.com site now and support us with your dollars.
[03:47:03.263 --> 03:47:05.887]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:13.164 --> 03:47:20.006]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:20.186 --> 03:47:24.408]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:24.508 --> 03:47:30.010]  We're back with Phil Hopkins of Vines.com.
[03:47:30.070 --> 03:47:39.993]  We're going to go back to him here in a second, but CNN has literally published an article, and the headline on CNN is, and this is from August the 10th, so it's four days ago now.
[03:47:40.634 --> 03:47:41.834]  Let me find the headline here.
[03:47:42.406 --> 03:47:50.334]  Let me find the exact quote where she says, and I quote, CNN has literally published an article claiming that InfoWars is complicit in domestic terrorism
[03:48:05.663 --> 03:48:08.565]  We've no evidence whatsoever to back up that claim.
[03:48:08.825 --> 03:48:15.629]  They published an article, somehow it got by their lawyers, and that is up on CNN.com right now.
[03:48:16.769 --> 03:48:19.391]  We need to talk about Alex Jones as the main headline.
[03:48:19.431 --> 03:48:27.175]  They've got a series of contributors, of commentators, speaking to that issue, and one of them, Rafia Zakaria,
[03:48:28.362 --> 03:48:36.046]  Sadly, domestic terrorism or Jones's dangerous speech in which he claims that he is in a holy war against Islam is not prosecuted under that statute.
[03:48:36.566 --> 03:48:42.349]  She goes on to say, let me find the exact quote, InfoWars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:48:42.729 --> 03:48:45.130]  That is on CNN right now.
[03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:49.072]  She says the new decision, she's talking about big tech banning InfoWars,
[03:48:49.787 --> 03:49:07.736]  It's a step forward in recognising that hate outlets such as Infowars—remember, the left-wing Tele Sir was also called a hate outlet by Facebook, they were banned—hate outlets such as Infowars are complicit in domestic terror and a relief to Muslim Americans like myself who have been the target of online assaults and threats.
[03:49:08.176 --> 03:49:18.562]  Now, the SPLC, back last year, I think it was, or the year before, called Majid Nawaz a Muslim reformist, called him an anti-Muslim extremist.
[03:49:18.602 --> 03:49:19.382]  They had to pay out
[03:49:19.841 --> 03:49:23.563]  Three million dollars in court for libeling him.
[03:49:23.963 --> 03:49:29.186]  Now, CNN has literally claimed that Infowars is complicit in domestic terror via one of their contributors.
[03:49:29.486 --> 03:49:36.110]  That is up right now live on CNN's website, so I'll be interested to see the fallout from that as we go forward.
[03:49:36.130 --> 03:49:44.274]  But going back to Bill Ottman of Minds.com, a social network that doesn't ban people, that doesn't shadow ban people, that doesn't censor people,
[03:49:45.091 --> 03:49:54.218]  Bill, Facebook, they're losing nearly 3 million users under the age of 25 in the US alone every single year.
[03:49:54.519 --> 03:49:57.181]  We see Twitter, their growth has stalled.
[03:49:57.421 --> 03:50:04.387]  We see Zuckerberg or one of his executives in a private meeting reportedly saying, they quote, they quote, don't care about publishers.
[03:50:04.907 --> 03:50:11.853]  And they warned that if publishers didn't work with them, quote, I'll be holding your hands with your dying business like in a hospice.
[03:50:12.473 --> 03:50:14.914]  Is Zuckerberg's arrogance going to come back to haunt him?
[03:50:15.295 --> 03:50:21.538]  How many more years before these platforms are in terminal decline, if they're not already?
[03:50:22.594 --> 03:50:23.455]  They are already.
[03:50:23.535 --> 03:50:26.576]  I mean, these algorithms have gotten so out of control.
[03:50:26.756 --> 03:50:29.878]  You used to be able to actually reach your followers or friends on Facebook.
[03:50:30.238 --> 03:50:34.901]  Now you're only reaching about 5% of your own followers organically.
[03:50:35.582 --> 03:50:39.424]  And because their algorithms are deciding to show you what they want you to see.
[03:50:39.584 --> 03:50:41.125]  It's not a pure chronological feed.
[03:50:41.165 --> 03:50:44.407]  So on mines, everything is 100% chronological and raw.
[03:50:44.687 --> 03:50:46.088]  We're never going to interfere with that.
[03:50:46.568 --> 03:50:48.249]  And additionally, you earn
[03:50:49.136 --> 03:50:52.379]  tokens for your contributions to the network every day.
[03:50:52.419 --> 03:50:59.185]  So whoever creates the most engaging content gets tokens and then you can use those tokens to boost your post for more views.
[03:50:59.626 --> 03:51:10.596]  So not only are we not filtering, we're giving people more of a voice because that's actually what the purpose of social media is supposed to be, is to share your voice.
[03:51:12.732 --> 03:51:15.213]  It's a concept that they seem to have forgotten about, isn't it?
[03:51:15.774 --> 03:51:17.594]  Now, I read your interview with the Daily Caller.
[03:51:17.634 --> 03:51:21.736]  You talked about a healthy society hinging on the free exchange of ideas.
[03:51:22.156 --> 03:51:28.119]  Tell us about Darrell Davis and how his story speaks to what's happening now with big tech censorship.
[03:51:29.204 --> 03:51:48.875]  Yeah, Daryl Davis is an incredible story of an African American man who befriended hundreds of members of the KKK and through open dialogue got them all to hand over their robes because they saw the humanity in each other and understood that obviously it doesn't make sense to be a part of the KKK and this is
[03:51:49.555 --> 03:51:57.447]  How communication and social evolution works is that through open discourse, the best ideas will rise to the top.
[03:51:57.708 --> 03:52:05.199]  Look, we're all getting things wrong sometimes, but through education and clear debate, the best ideas are going to win.
[03:52:06.937 --> 03:52:07.357]  Exactly.
[03:52:07.417 --> 03:52:12.699]  Again, as he said, Twitter started as the free speech wing of the Free Speech Party.
[03:52:13.119 --> 03:52:15.841]  Quite ironic now that Twitter is the last remaining holdout.
[03:52:15.881 --> 03:52:23.924]  I mean, we have heard whispers behind the scenes that Jack Dorsey, at least to some extent, does support free speech, that he has had meetings with people.
[03:52:23.944 --> 03:52:29.686]  We had the announcement yesterday, Twitter is reaching out to Conservatives on a charm offensive.
[03:52:30.506 --> 03:52:43.630]  To try and get them on board and to try and reassure their concern, whether anything comes of that, given that there are literally giant mobs of outraged, permanently offended idiots on there, campaigning every day to shut us down, remains to be seen.
[03:52:43.990 --> 03:52:50.873]  But here in the last couple of minutes, Bill, just tell us how easy it is to sign up for Minds.com and why people should do so right now.
[03:52:51.993 --> 03:52:54.134]  Yeah, just very easy to sign up, Blake.
[03:52:54.734 --> 03:52:55.714]  Other social networks.
[03:52:55.734 --> 03:52:58.355]  The key thing that I would have you take away is that
[03:52:59.051 --> 03:53:04.415]  Where we spend our time online is how the power structure of the internet is distributed.
[03:53:04.475 --> 03:53:15.684]  So when you even just create an account on an open source, peer-to-peer alternative like Mines, you are helping empower us and other alternatives to grow.
[03:53:15.764 --> 03:53:20.588]  Where we sit, the browsers that we use, you know, use the Brave browser, use Firefox,
[03:53:21.485 --> 03:53:23.986]  Don't use proprietary surveillance systems.
[03:53:24.506 --> 03:53:26.327]  It is possible to shift away.
[03:53:26.887 --> 03:53:33.589]  And, you know, we're sitting on these devices all day and that is building the metrics of all these different corporations.
[03:53:34.209 --> 03:53:38.090]  So, you know, finally, the alternatives are catching up in terms of the functionality.
[03:53:38.651 --> 03:53:41.412]  And I would just say at the minimum, supplement your experience.
[03:53:41.432 --> 03:53:45.793]  If you're not ready to fully jump ship, you know, just get started.
[03:53:47.626 --> 03:53:53.010]  Exactly, and I'll start doing that right now with this interview, because it ain't going up on YouTube, forget about that.
[03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:58.334]  If you want to watch this interview, it will go up on Minds.com, and it will go up on BitChute, and we'll promote that.
[03:53:58.654 --> 03:54:02.557]  If we get access to our website back, it will obviously go up on Infowars.com as well.
[03:54:02.938 --> 03:54:04.118]  But we're going to leave it there for now.
[03:54:04.439 --> 03:54:06.260]  Bill Ottman, Minds.com.
[03:54:06.300 --> 03:54:07.181]  Thanks for joining us today.
[03:54:07.201 --> 03:54:08.682]  Thanks very much, Bob.
[03:54:09.847 --> 03:54:10.288]  Thanks, Bill.
[03:54:10.308 --> 03:54:11.048]  There goes Bill Oppmann.
[03:54:11.128 --> 03:54:14.412]  Please go and sign up at Minds.com today.
[03:54:14.612 --> 03:54:14.993]  I'm there.
[03:54:15.013 --> 03:54:17.455]  I've got about 80,000 followers at this point.
[03:54:17.736 --> 03:54:21.119]  You know you're not going to get banned there for exercising free speech.
[03:54:21.159 --> 03:54:26.185]  The only reason you get banned is for endorsing, advocating legal activity, and obviously
[03:54:26.869 --> 03:54:31.832]  Twitter, Facebook and the rest of them have terms of service which are slightly more restrictive than that.
[03:54:31.912 --> 03:54:38.456]  Minds.com aligns itself with the First Amendment so you know you're not going to get banned and it's growing rapidly.
[03:54:38.516 --> 03:54:42.778]  It's not really a right-wing echo chamber as some people claim these other websites are.
[03:54:43.098 --> 03:54:52.183]  It's people from actual real liberals who support free speech, conservatives and whoever, having an actual conversation, God forbid, without being censored.
[03:54:52.223 --> 03:54:53.204]  So please go and sign up.
[03:54:53.624 --> 03:54:56.708]  For Minds.com, fight back against big tech censorship.
[03:54:57.048 --> 03:55:08.961]  Also support Infowars.com by going to infowarsstore.com and getting the specials right now to help us against this, what is now a purge, what is now basically a cyber attack on our website.
[03:55:09.742 --> 03:55:13.566]  To the point where CNN has published an article, as I just mentioned,
[03:55:14.238 --> 03:55:23.050]  Bearing in mind that CNN was the network that launched this purge, they launched this lobbying campaign back in February of this year.
[03:55:23.290 --> 03:55:25.633]  Their first target was the Alex Jones Channel.
[03:55:26.033 --> 03:55:32.362]  They tried to create a controversy over the Parkland shootings to get that shut down with community guideline strikes.
[03:55:33.012 --> 03:55:35.573]  Then they lobbied Facebook to shut us down.
[03:55:35.953 --> 03:55:39.414]  After Facebook shut us down, they lobbied Twitter to shut us down.
[03:55:39.454 --> 03:55:45.596]  They haven't been successful with Twitter yet, but they were the genesis of this campaign to purge InfoWars from the internet.
[03:55:46.316 --> 03:55:55.500]  Now they've published an article which literally accuses and says InfoWars is, quote, these are the words of Rafia Zakaria, a CNN contributor.
[03:55:55.860 --> 03:55:59.681]  She says, InfoWars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:56:00.555 --> 03:56:00.895]  Okay.
[03:56:01.315 --> 03:56:05.817]  This is going to have some interesting repercussions, but we'll leave that article there for now.
[03:56:06.097 --> 03:56:06.697]  There you see it.
[03:56:06.857 --> 03:56:09.178]  InfoWars is complicit in domestic terror.
[03:56:09.478 --> 03:56:15.120]  They were right to ban us because apparently we're like ISIS, we're like Al-Qaeda, we encourage terror attacks.
[03:56:15.160 --> 03:56:17.501]  We've never encouraged any violence whatsoever.
[03:56:17.821 --> 03:56:20.542]  We assume we disavow all violence and anyone who
[03:56:21.022 --> 03:56:22.483]  endorses it or suggests it.
[03:56:22.863 --> 03:56:24.244]  It's complete BS.
[03:56:24.504 --> 03:56:27.586]  This is why CNN is fake news.
[03:56:27.906 --> 03:56:31.468]  Let's hit another couple of headlines here in the final minute of the show.
[03:56:32.348 --> 03:56:37.711]  Sweden is burning migrant gangs unleashed coordinated firebomb rampage across multiple cities.
[03:56:38.512 --> 03:56:42.734]  So the Swedish national election is next month in just a few weeks time.
[03:56:43.154 --> 03:56:49.498]  The Sweden Democrats, which is the anti-mass migration party, the populist party, the anti-globalist party,
[03:56:50.120 --> 03:56:50.821]  We're good to go.
[03:56:50.841 --> 03:56:51.281]  We're good to go.
[03:57:16.152 --> 03:57:17.215]  Cars set on fire.
[03:57:17.255 --> 03:57:24.814]  Of course, this is a regular occurrence in Sweden, but they're saying it's never been this coordinated and it's never been this intense.
[03:57:25.307 --> 03:57:29.409]  Now the police are saying they want to talk to the parents of the guilty minors.
[03:57:29.869 --> 03:57:33.672]  Sounds like they're really going to do a lot to prevent that from happening in the future, isn't it?
[03:57:33.952 --> 03:57:35.232]  But Sweden's got an election.
[03:57:35.573 --> 03:57:38.334]  The party that's promised to deal with this is ahead in the polls.
[03:57:38.814 --> 03:57:40.195]  This is going to backfire on them.
[03:57:40.555 --> 03:57:41.376]  Trump was right.
[03:57:41.616 --> 03:57:45.978]  He said his big last night in Sweden speech, he was ridiculed, but he was proven right once again.
[03:57:46.318 --> 03:57:46.999]  That's it for the show.
[03:57:47.039 --> 03:57:48.460]  Warren Widow and Troyer is coming up.
[03:57:48.540 --> 03:57:48.940]  InfoWars.
[03:57:49.560 --> 03:57:54.604]  This is, without a prescription, the strongest FDA-cleared silver you can get.
[03:57:54.724 --> 03:58:03.029]  Just a slightly watered-down version of the top-selling prescription, Mega Silver, that is the savior now at the hospitals, clinics, you name it.
[03:58:03.089 --> 03:58:11.835]  It is super silver, wound dressing gel, trademarked for first aid, management of minor cuts, lacerations, abrasions, first and second degree burns, skin irritations.
[03:58:12.055 --> 03:58:14.277]  It is sold mainly to hospitals.
[03:58:14.397 --> 03:58:16.398]  Some medical-grade stores have it.
[03:58:16.578 --> 03:58:17.579]  It's just incredible.
[03:58:17.739 --> 03:58:19.340]  It's $29.95 out of the gates.
[03:58:19.420 --> 03:58:20.580]  This is next level.
[03:58:20.600 --> 03:58:22.201]  Bacteria and viruses don't like this.
[03:58:22.742 --> 03:58:26.884]  It's just a little bit less strong than the prescription silver.
[03:58:27.224 --> 03:58:31.626]  It's a well-known product sold to hospitals and clinics, and it's what people that are doctors and others use themselves.
[03:58:31.766 --> 03:58:35.228]  When all else fails, as you know, a lot of stuff isn't working now on infections.
[03:58:35.388 --> 03:58:36.628]  It's another weapon in the arsenal.
[03:58:36.789 --> 03:58:39.630]  I can tell you right now, my dad is an oral surgeon and dentist.
[03:58:39.970 --> 03:58:48.656]  And we were searching out the very best, most powerful silvers used by hospice, and he ended up getting a hold of one of the top companies in the world, and it turned out they're listeners.
[03:58:48.916 --> 03:58:53.320]  Inforestore.com, Inforestlife.com, or 888-533-139.
[03:58:53.600 --> 03:58:59.444]  I tasked my father, who's gotten stuff approved before, gotten FDA approval before with other stuff, I tasked him, I said,
