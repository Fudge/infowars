[00:00:09.597 --> 00:00:18.079]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:35.922]  It's Friday, December 7th, 2018.
[00:00:40.327 --> 00:00:41.288]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.409]  We'll be here for the next four hours in the War Room with Owen Schroer, Roger Stone, and others.
[00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.250]  We got Mark Dice coming up.
[00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.291]  We have Paul Watson joining us imminently.
[00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.213]  Here in just about 60 seconds, huge breaking news.
[00:00:53.154 --> 00:00:55.875]  We have Roger Stone with big breaking news and other guests today.
[00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:57.116]  Plus, we'll take your phone calls.
[00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:07.722]  I also have gotten some news the last few weeks that's coming to crystal clear clarity about the next phase of the attacks trying to bring down InfoWars.
[00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.470]  And they see it as a bellwether that once they get Infowars taken down, they're going to make their move.
[00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.370]  You've seen the great energy behind it.
[00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:33.514]  They have looked at their equations, their political calculus, and we are seen as a army that's pro-American, army of information warfare operatives that tell the truth with our secret weapon, that once we've been taken out, then they'll make their main move on Trump.
[00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:35.355]  They've been given those orders to take us down.
[00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:40.969]  And it has gone into very criminal nature, and it just shows the type of fight we're in.
[00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:45.835]  The Federal Reserve is private run for profit, mainly owned by European robber barons.
[00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:48.639]  It's been trying to suppress the economy coming back.
[00:01:50.387 --> 00:01:54.512]  They've announced interest rate hikes over and over again now that it's admitted to be killing the economy.
[00:01:54.872 --> 00:01:57.074]  They say, OK, we won't raise interest rates yesterday.
[00:01:57.475 --> 00:01:58.316]  Stock market comes back.
[00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.838]  Today, they go, oh, actually, we're going to do it.
[00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:02.500]  It plunges 400 more points.
[00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:04.042]  We'll be looking at all of that.
[00:02:04.522 --> 00:02:08.046]  Does Tucker Carlson write about Trump not delivering on any of his promises?
[00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:09.868]  That's a publicity grabbing.
[00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.669]  The thing that Tucker's done.
[00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:12.990]  I know why he's done it.
[00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.471]  But I'm going to be talking about that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:17.191]  Is it accurate?
[00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.051]  Partially, but also not partially.
[00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:22.692]  So we're going to give an expert analysis with the real facts of that.
[00:02:22.732 --> 00:02:23.953]  But it's a good debate starter.
[00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:26.073]  It's a way to get the president's attention.
[00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.034]  Something I'll be doing very, very soon in other ways.
[00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:30.554]  So that's all coming up.
[00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:36.076]  But when we return, Paul Watson will break down because he's lived off and on in France for a long time.
[00:02:37.267 --> 00:02:45.235]  The chain reaction, because even the head of the EU, Juncker, even Macron, says this could bring down the super state EU, which is a good thing.
[00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:46.376]  It's an authoritarian regime.
[00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:55.865]  And what's really happening with the Yellow Vest movement that is a nationalist, anti-radical Islam movement, it's not about the gas tax increase.
[00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:57.126]  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:02:57.146 --> 00:03:01.771]  We're going to break in two minutes, but Paul, give us a preview of what's coming up.
[00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:17.571]  Well, Alex, there's going to be a massive demonstration this weekend in Paris and in other cities, despite the fact, as we know, as we reported earlier this week, that Macron caved almost immediately on the request for the gas tax to be eliminated.
[00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:19.572]  First, they suspended it for six months.
[00:03:19.612 --> 00:03:21.954]  Now they, you know, canned it altogether.
[00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:28.660]  But their demands have not been met, proving, as you just said, the gas tax was not the only thing.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.582]  It was a straw that broke the camel's back.
[00:03:31.204 --> 00:03:36.028]  So basically, Macron was hailed as the saviour of globalism just over a year ago when he took office.
[00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:40.851]  Hillary Clinton tweeted, victory for Macron for France, the EU and the world.
[00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:45.915]  Sadiq Khan tweeted, the French people have chosen hope over fear and unity over division.
[00:03:46.356 --> 00:03:47.897]  He was hailed as the great saviour.
[00:03:48.457 --> 00:03:57.020]  Today, his approval rating is literally at 18%, and that was a poll before last weekend's riots, so it's probably even lower now.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.223]  The army's heading to Paris, some of the police have shown solidarity with the protesters, so it looks like there's going to be another big flashpoint this weekend, Alex.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.901]  And let's be clear, Macron is the equivalent of a Vichy French trader.
[00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:14.262]  Those are the traders that worked with the Nazis and occupied France for five years during World War II.
[00:04:14.622 --> 00:04:18.323]  He's literally saying, you cannot have France.
[00:04:18.784 --> 00:04:20.604]  To be patriotic is to be bad.
[00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:22.825]  Patriotism means getting rid of your country.
[00:04:23.245 --> 00:04:28.026]  He has just made out, he said, we want to bring in 200 million North Africans in the next 20 years.
[00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:29.507]  We need to get rid of France.
[00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:31.367]  The heart of France is Africa.
[00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:33.748]  I mean, this guy is literally trying to kill the country.
[00:04:35.618 --> 00:04:39.440]  No, precisely, and they all rallied behind him and now they've all got egg on their faces.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.844]  Initially he supported limiting immigration, Alex, and then he flipped and that's when his poll numbers started diving.
[00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:48.765]  So we can look at how that started as well after the break.
[00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:50.806]  And let's be clear, why is France so important?
[00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:55.029]  The globalists admit this is one of the final dominoes to bring them down.
[00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:56.569]  This is a devastating victory.
[00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.011]  We salute the yellow shirts.
[00:05:03.286 --> 00:05:05.588]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:12.033]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:05:12.353 --> 00:05:14.074]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[00:06:11.791 --> 00:06:15.912]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:18.072]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.152 --> 00:06:21.873]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:25.734]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:06:25.794 --> 00:06:27.814]  You've got it.
[00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:32.315]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.335]  You've got it.
[00:06:44.941 --> 00:06:49.544]  This is going to be one Friday broadcast you're not going to want to miss.
[00:06:49.684 --> 00:06:52.006]  And, oh, next week, you don't want to miss any of those.
[00:06:52.026 --> 00:06:53.527]  And you know I don't hype stuff.
[00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:56.869]  And I tell you, believe me, you want to tune in next week.
[00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:58.190]  Every day of the week.
[00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:04.654]  We have Communist China.
[00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:11.041]  Putting spy chips on all the cell phones produced there, including Apple.
[00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:12.281]  This has come out.
[00:07:13.042 --> 00:07:14.983]  But they have the code keys to all the Apple phones.
[00:07:15.463 --> 00:07:16.143]  Why is that important?
[00:07:16.764 --> 00:07:17.624]  Well, it's beyond important.
[00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:27.590]  Because the second biggest phone maker in the world, that's bigger than Apple, had their chief operating officer arrested four days ago.
[00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.230]  We mentioned it.
[00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.511]  Now we know why.
[00:07:30.612 --> 00:07:33.515]  And it's not over trading with Iran and getting around sanctions.
[00:07:33.555 --> 00:07:34.575]  That's the cut and dry.
[00:07:35.156 --> 00:07:36.217]  It's the spy chips.
[00:07:36.877 --> 00:07:40.140]  On the phones, the phones are illegal on U.S.
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.981]  military bases.
[00:07:41.522 --> 00:07:43.263]  It's the second biggest phone maker in the world.
[00:07:44.064 --> 00:07:45.205]  It's state-run in China.
[00:07:45.545 --> 00:07:51.450]  And the daughter of one of the top heads of the Communist Party is about to be extradited from Canada to the U.S.
[00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.072]  and China's calling it an act of war.
[00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:55.940]  Our trader media is attacking Trump for doing it.
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.121]  This is exactly what he should be doing.
[00:07:58.441 --> 00:08:01.082]  Arresting all the heads of these communist Chinese firms.
[00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:02.862]  Arrogant criminals!
[00:08:05.363 --> 00:08:06.183]  Let me explain this again.
[00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:13.506]  They found on these phones 10 years ago, chips that take over everything in your house, everything in your building, everything in your company.
[00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:16.587]  Steals your passcodes, and then it passes on to China.
[00:08:17.868 --> 00:08:18.468]  You understand that?
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.664]  Now, the media is acting dumb saying they don't know why, but it's on record why.
[00:08:23.684 --> 00:08:25.225]  I'll give you the rest of the story next hour.
[00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:27.908]  Earth shattering.
[00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:32.111]  We're going to get obviously into what's really happening with the stock market.
[00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:34.814]  The Federal Reserve said they're going to raise rates again, signaling the decline.
[00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:39.076]  They bait-and-switched yesterday, saying, oh, we're going to stop raising rates.
[00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:39.976]  The stock market came back.
[00:08:40.256 --> 00:08:41.277]  They said, oh, we're going to raise them.
[00:08:41.778 --> 00:08:42.798]  This morning, it plunged.
[00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:44.180]  They're playing games here.
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.043]  It's insider trading from the folks at the private New York head fed.
[00:08:48.563 --> 00:08:51.025]  They give their buddies in Wall Street what's about to happen, like George Soros.
[00:08:51.285 --> 00:08:51.986]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:54.308]  Meanwhile, U.S.
[00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:57.610]  fears Iran planning massive regional war in the Middle East.
[00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.871]  That's exactly what they're planning.
[00:08:59.111 --> 00:08:59.712]  We'll look at that.
[00:09:03.387 --> 00:09:08.328]  But first, let's go to Paul Joseph Watson with an update because he lives off and on in France and in Spain.
[00:09:08.588 --> 00:09:09.388]  He's in London now.
[00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:15.030]  France, 95% of speed cameras in one region destroyed overnight in a yellow vest protest.
[00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.871]  Beligard Macron predicts major violence.
[00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:19.171]  The fall of France.
[00:09:19.511 --> 00:09:23.372]  The French interior minister said a month ago, France is already basically gone if they don't reverse it now.
[00:09:25.305 --> 00:09:28.686]  Meanwhile, the EU says they're afraid the whole EU is about to collapse.
[00:09:28.706 --> 00:09:33.088]  Well, yeah, you want global carbon taxes, you want open borders, you want to conquer the nation.
[00:09:33.368 --> 00:09:43.592]  You thought humanity was asleep, but we now know the Yellow Vest are a nationalist populist movement that support Marie Le Pen, who's more hardcore than Trump.
[00:09:43.892 --> 00:09:45.593]  Paul Watson, break it down for us.
[00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:49.554]  Well, this has been brewing for a while, Alex.
[00:09:49.674 --> 00:09:54.316]  It's no surprise that over the past few decades, the top two selling books in France
[00:09:55.143 --> 00:09:55.984]  We're good to go.
[00:10:15.228 --> 00:10:18.150]  They obviously the yellow vest stems from it's a law in France.
[00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:25.534]  You have to have two high visibility jackets in your vehicle at all times, which illustrates the onerous bureaucracy that they have to live under.
[00:10:26.314 --> 00:10:29.196]  But this is a repudiation of a technocratic elite, Alex.
[00:10:29.256 --> 00:10:31.517]  It's a repudiation of the global warming tax.
[00:10:31.857 --> 00:10:38.300]  It's a repudiation of Macron, who is basically just a glorified administrator for the European Commission.
[00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:39.521]  He's not a president.
[00:10:39.541 --> 00:10:40.842]  He doesn't really have that much power.
[00:10:41.562 --> 00:10:43.083]  So it's again, it's this Trump effect.
[00:10:43.826 --> 00:10:47.948]  You know, there were anecdotal reports of these protesters chanting, we want Trump, we want Trump.
[00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:51.310]  It's almost a mirror image of what drove Trump to victory.
[00:10:51.630 --> 00:11:02.296]  It's a silent, forgotten, non-urban majority who've come to realise that their economic future has been sold down the river for cheap foreign labour, for cheap foreign goods.
[00:11:02.956 --> 00:11:13.162]  The rural towns, the rural areas in France are being emptied out, they're being depopulated because everyone's having to run into the dystopian metropolis city to try and get a job.
[00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:15.323]  Mainly in the service industry.
[00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:21.525]  That's their only option now because their industry is being hollowed out just like it was in the Rust Belt in America.
[00:11:21.946 --> 00:11:30.329]  Then you have the other factor which is the complete lack of integration of migrants and basically the fact that France is being reverse colonized.
[00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:38.313]  There were more mosques built in France over the past 30 years than Catholic churches built ever in the country.
[00:11:38.353 --> 00:11:40.494]  That gives you an illustration of what's going on there.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.041]  So the country's being reverse colonized.
[00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:58.045]  And when you talk to these protesters, when you listen to what their demands are, it's very much centered on national identity and the complete lack of integration that the French government has presided over with these millions of mainly Muslim migrants coming into the country.
[00:11:58.065 --> 00:12:00.966]  This is basically Europe's autoimmune system is kicking in.
[00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:06.267]  They keep using France, like the California of Europe, as the test ground to see what they will put up with.
[00:12:06.627 --> 00:12:08.648]  And finally, they've made the French revolt.
[00:12:10.293 --> 00:12:12.474]  Yeah, it's like the autoimmune system thing.
[00:12:13.094 --> 00:12:14.995]  But this is funny, Alex.
[00:12:15.455 --> 00:12:19.316]  So we've got all these people on tape saying, this is why we're protesting.
[00:12:19.596 --> 00:12:21.297]  It's the soaring cost of living.
[00:12:21.357 --> 00:12:22.378]  It's the gas tax.
[00:12:22.438 --> 00:12:23.638]  It's the mass immigration.
[00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:24.878]  They're all on tape.
[00:12:24.898 --> 00:12:26.339]  They're all out on the streets saying this.
[00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:28.660]  But not according to BuzzFeed.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.561]  BuzzFeed's figured out the real reason why these protests are happening.
[00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:39.564]  And it's because Facebook had an algorithm change at the start of the year, which more heavily featured local news.
[00:12:40.084 --> 00:12:43.206]  So these people don't have any legitimate grievances, Alex.
[00:12:43.507 --> 00:12:49.411]  It's just the fact that Facebook promoted certain pages over others in the past few months.
[00:12:49.771 --> 00:12:51.392]  So you know what they're doing there, don't you?
[00:12:51.793 --> 00:12:53.874]  These are the same people who deplatformed you.
[00:12:54.134 --> 00:13:00.439]  That's a dog whistle for Facebook to ban these protest pages that are organising these protests.
[00:13:01.517 --> 00:13:02.358]  Let's expand.
[00:13:02.578 --> 00:13:04.599]  They're saying what globalists are saying.
[00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:08.121]  You can't have sports teams named after towns because that gives you identity.
[00:13:08.401 --> 00:13:09.362]  Or named after a nation.
[00:13:09.402 --> 00:13:11.163]  The EU's been calling for that for a decade.
[00:13:11.203 --> 00:13:12.043]  Now they're doing it.
[00:13:12.304 --> 00:13:16.086]  In five years all the national names are banned in soccer and football.
[00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:17.207]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:13:17.227 --> 00:13:20.409]  They're saying don't let people promote local news period.
[00:13:20.649 --> 00:13:25.912]  So we go from hate to extremists to right-wing to Alex Jones to ban everything local.
[00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.451]  Exactly.
[00:13:28.631 --> 00:13:30.752]  It's a dog whistle to try and ban these protests.
[00:13:30.792 --> 00:13:39.980]  Because again, when you have an Arab Spring and the left wing approves of them using social media to facilitate their protests, that's good and that should be encouraged.
[00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.325]  But God forbid populists try to use the exact same tools for the exact same thing.
[00:13:45.705 --> 00:13:49.408]  Not only is it frowned upon, it's a dog whistle to try and get those pages banned.
[00:13:49.688 --> 00:13:51.650]  So of course it's not about an algorithm.
[00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.771]  That's not the reason they're out on the streets.
[00:13:54.132 --> 00:13:55.052]  Go and talk to them.
[00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:56.454]  Listen to what they're saying.
[00:13:56.714 --> 00:13:58.155]  Their cost of living is soaring.
[00:13:58.255 --> 00:13:59.296]  You moved out of France.
[00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.136]  I mean, let's talk about it.
[00:14:00.156 --> 00:14:03.079]  They took your steel mills where you worked and your dad worked and your brother worked.
[00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.260]  They took those away.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.442]  So you guys took the money you had, moved and bought a bed and breakfast in France.
[00:14:07.582 --> 00:14:08.543]  It was hellish.
[00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:10.765]  And you said riots and Islamists running around everywhere.
[00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:12.887]  So you guys evacuated there two years ago.
[00:14:13.127 --> 00:14:14.548]  I mean, you know what you're talking about, Paul.
[00:14:14.568 --> 00:14:15.028]  Describe it.
[00:14:15.048 --> 00:14:16.990]  You told me you'll be in a little village.
[00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:20.743]  And there'll be Muslims running around, crapping all over the ground, screaming at people.
[00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:25.776]  Well, the prevalence of hijabs definitely increased.
[00:14:25.816 --> 00:14:32.239]  I mean, my parents were living in a very remote area, the local town, just in the five years that they were living there.
[00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:35.681]  You would go there at the start and it would be completely normal.
[00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:37.661]  Within five years, everyone was wearing a hijab.
[00:14:38.622 --> 00:14:40.343]  The pace of change was very rapid.
[00:14:40.703 --> 00:14:46.165]  And that's what a lot of people are seeing, even in the suburban areas, not just in the major cities.
[00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:47.966]  But it's interesting, you know, because
[00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:59.201]  Macron, despite being this completely arrogant sociopath, as many actual psychiatrists have said that he is a sociopath, you know, comparing himself to Jupiter, the Roman god, and things like that.
[00:15:00.122 --> 00:15:05.185]  He started off his tenure being somewhat wanting to control immigration.
[00:15:05.385 --> 00:15:07.367]  He talked about... It was a bait and switch.
[00:15:07.587 --> 00:15:08.227]  It was a bait and switch.
[00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:09.108]  Let me ask you this, Paul.
[00:15:09.528 --> 00:15:11.389]  What's going to happen in the 50 seconds we have left?
[00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.731]  A lot of experts say the EU is doomed forever.
[00:15:13.771 --> 00:15:14.712]  This is accelerating it.
[00:15:14.912 --> 00:15:17.974]  And now the rebellion under the yellow vest name is spreading across Europe.
[00:15:19.409 --> 00:15:20.430]  It's spreading across Europe.
[00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:21.932]  It's spreading to Germany, Belgium, Holland.
[00:15:21.952 --> 00:15:23.814]  They're arresting protest leaders in Holland.
[00:15:24.215 --> 00:15:26.818]  People are asking, is this the European Spring?
[00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:31.083]  It's certainly the biggest uprising in 50 years since the 1968 riots.
[00:15:31.503 --> 00:15:35.788]  So this weekend is going to tell us whether it's going to kick into high gear or subside.
[00:15:35.828 --> 00:15:37.851]  It will give us a very clear indication.
[00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:47.360]  And just like they said on the Titanic's maiden voyage that not even God can sink this ship, McRod said, I'm God, and a couple years later we're learning he's actually toilet paper.
[00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:52.104]  Read Paul's incredible reports at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com and spread them.
[00:15:52.345 --> 00:15:57.029]  Paul, we'll be watching your reportage on this very closely and Dan Lyman reporting from Paris.
[00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.351]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:58.371 --> 00:16:00.413]  Stay with us with Roger Stone with Big Breaking News.
[00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:04.823]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:06.684]  I'm too weak.
[00:16:07.064 --> 00:16:08.325]  Oh, don't kill me.
[00:16:08.745 --> 00:16:09.445]  Please.
[00:16:11.086 --> 00:16:17.289]  At Apple, we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on these challenges.
[00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:21.751]  That's why we should only have one message.
[00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:26.673]  You have no place on our platform.
[00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:31.736]  We have no home here.
[00:16:33.474 --> 00:16:38.555]  We are not afraid to say that our values drive our curation.
[00:16:38.595 --> 00:16:40.256]  The secret's on a universe!
[00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:41.176]  It's all there!
[00:16:41.656 --> 00:16:43.757]  You have no place on our platform.
[00:16:44.117 --> 00:16:45.997]  Life is fiery with its beauty!
[00:16:46.637 --> 00:16:48.258]  You have no place.
[00:16:48.438 --> 00:16:50.538]  Unlock your human control!
[00:16:50.558 --> 00:16:52.098]  You have no home here!
[00:16:52.158 --> 00:16:54.779]  Defeat the globalists who want to shatter your mind!
[00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:57.420]  Their doorway is to perception!
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.680]  I want to see you truly live!
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:02.821]  I want to see you truly be who you are!
[00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.331]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[00:17:25.817 --> 00:17:28.238]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[00:17:32.014 --> 00:17:35.736]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[00:17:35.896 --> 00:17:40.958]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[00:17:41.118 --> 00:17:42.278]  And here's the best part.
[00:17:42.438 --> 00:17:44.019]  It is absolutely free.
[00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:49.221]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:53.343]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[00:17:53.423 --> 00:17:57.324]  It's the InfoWars official app, taken on the globalist at point-blank range.
[00:17:57.544 --> 00:18:01.646]  And with your help spreading it, and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[00:18:02.006 --> 00:18:08.471]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[00:18:10.168 --> 00:18:11.609]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:16.814]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[00:18:17.975 --> 00:18:23.899]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:32.326]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[00:18:33.087 --> 00:18:59.259]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out and then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:06.824]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[00:19:07.264 --> 00:19:09.025]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[00:19:09.085 --> 00:19:14.008]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[00:19:14.468 --> 00:19:14.968]  It's big.
[00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:15.929]  It's bad.
[00:19:16.369 --> 00:19:21.592]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[00:19:21.612 --> 00:19:23.913]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[00:19:24.333 --> 00:19:27.555]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[00:19:28.155 --> 00:19:29.097]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:19:29.137 --> 00:19:30.298]  That's been going on for over a month.
[00:19:30.318 --> 00:19:32.301]  50 to 75% off.
[00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:33.342]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.340]  The Double Patriot points.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.281]  That's what's happening in about a week.
[00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:43.263]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[00:19:43.723 --> 00:19:48.105]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:50.005]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[00:19:50.265 --> 00:19:52.066]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[00:19:52.266 --> 00:19:54.327]  And don't fight the crowds at infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:58.508]  And for myself and the Infowars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:09.035]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.621]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:35.241]  to 3 p.m.
[00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:35.722]  Central.
[00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:37.022]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:43.306]  The most demonized, the most lied about, the most attacked, the most censored transmission in the world because we are dead on accurate.
[00:20:44.407 --> 00:20:49.430]  You heard Paul Watson for years predicting an uprising in France against the EU and it leading to his fall.
[00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.151]  You see it happening.
[00:20:50.811 --> 00:20:56.417]  You've seen us months ago talking about MKUltra programming mass shooters from declassified documents.
[00:20:57.038 --> 00:20:58.720]  Now it's on DrugsReport.com today.
[00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.181]  It's all over big newspapers.
[00:21:00.922 --> 00:21:03.445]  Yahoo News, Reuters, The Sun.
[00:21:05.074 --> 00:21:14.820]  Truth about CIA's illegal MKUltra mind control experiments using drugs, hypnosis and electronic devices to create assassins, revealed in sensational new documents, officials said for decades.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.461]  Even more is coming out.
[00:21:17.021 --> 00:21:19.983]  Like Theodore Kaczynski being in MKUltra.
[00:21:20.483 --> 00:21:22.084]  He, of course, was the Unabomber.
[00:21:23.948 --> 00:21:26.791]  It's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:27.231 --> 00:21:30.935]  We're joined right now by Roger Stone.
[00:21:30.995 --> 00:21:32.036]  He's in the plane.
[00:21:32.337 --> 00:21:34.919]  They're about to close the door in the next five minutes, but I had to get him on.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.461]  He predicted it.
[00:21:37.842 --> 00:21:39.663]  General Kelly, imminent departure.
[00:21:40.003 --> 00:21:41.163]  Now he has resigned.
[00:21:41.643 --> 00:21:42.984]  What does that signify?
[00:21:43.744 --> 00:21:52.507]  What does the news signify that, oh, Mueller's going to file these big court documents today that they even admit now, even the left is saying are nothing burgers?
[00:21:52.807 --> 00:21:53.727]  Give us the latest.
[00:21:54.548 --> 00:22:01.210]  Former Chief Advisor to Donald John Trump, who Trump called on Monday, a man with incredible guts, Roger Stone.
[00:22:02.851 --> 00:22:04.612]  Alex, it's an incredible day here.
[00:22:05.353 --> 00:22:07.694]  Again, InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:22:08.374 --> 00:22:11.476]  We predicted the departure of General John Kelly.
[00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:11.976]  Here it is.
[00:22:12.797 --> 00:22:17.920]  Incredible tweet by the president today signaling exactly when he's going to drop the bomb.
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:31.823]  The day that Mueller announces his final report, he will have a devastating counterattack that lays out the criminality of Mueller, Clinton, Obama, Brennan, Comey, and the rest.
[00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:37.325]  Very clear from his tweet today that the president is hunkered down and ready for battle.
[00:22:38.266 --> 00:22:41.589]  Yesterday, I went to Washington, D.C.
[00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:50.039]  to take on Congressman Adam Schiff, because I'm tired of his lies and smears and shifty org games.
[00:22:50.119 --> 00:22:55.485]  Tremendous response from that, and a really energized group of patriots at the American
[00:22:56.065 --> 00:22:57.206]  Thank you very much.
[00:23:10.572 --> 00:23:10.872]  That's right.
[00:23:10.892 --> 00:23:25.427]  In case some listeners or viewers haven't seen the tweet, there's quite a few about the Big Clinton Foundation documents coming out that was paper play as if we already knew, that Comey and Rosenstein helped cover it up with illegal warrants, the fact that they all worked together.
[00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:27.149]  There's a whole group of tweets coming out.
[00:23:29.217 --> 00:23:31.859]  It's very clear the President is ready for battle.
[00:23:32.099 --> 00:23:35.841]  I ran into Rudy Giuliani, one of the President's attorneys, last night.
[00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:40.024]  He was looking very happy, very confident.
[00:23:40.044 --> 00:23:53.372]  You know, I think with Presidents on a war footing, and he understands that the big state move to take him down is around the corner, and he's poised to counterattack, I think to devastating effect.
[00:23:53.832 --> 00:23:55.033]  I really think he is ready.
[00:23:55.053 --> 00:23:56.294]  And he's got the goods.
[00:23:56.694 --> 00:23:58.255]  He is finally, I think, woke.
[00:23:58.835 --> 00:24:05.923]  And figured out that this isn't about Paul Manafort or Roger Stone or Jerry Corsi or Alex Jones.
[00:24:06.043 --> 00:24:08.565]  It's about taking out the President of the United States.
[00:24:09.066 --> 00:24:12.610]  It's about undoing what they could not do at the ballot box in 2016.
[00:24:15.713 --> 00:24:21.179]  Roger, Trump obviously knows he has to take the gloves off right now.
[00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:24.905]  What do you expect him to do next?
[00:24:24.945 --> 00:24:26.885]  Because we need major counter-offensives now.
[00:24:27.826 --> 00:24:33.368]  He said treason charges coming, but does he have anybody in the Justice Department that aren't complete cowards?
[00:24:34.728 --> 00:24:35.748]  You know, I think he does.
[00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:39.550]  I think he has got the detonator in his hands, in my opinion.
[00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:41.570]  I think he is ready to make his move.
[00:24:42.771 --> 00:24:51.134]  And really the turning point, in my view, was when Paul Manafort's attorneys and Jerry Corsi's attorneys told the President's attorneys
[00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:53.650]  All the questioning is about the president.
[00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:59.333]  All the questioning is about taking down the chief executive.
[00:24:59.473 --> 00:25:01.314]  This isn't about his underlings.
[00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:02.915]  This isn't about his minions.
[00:25:03.595 --> 00:25:07.597]  This is a speeding bullet heading directly for the head of the president.
[00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:15.801]  And we're highly confident that he's ready for an honorable war fight.
[00:25:16.863 --> 00:25:23.024]  This is an incredible moment because with Nixon, his main opposition, you didn't have total proof of criminal activity.
[00:25:23.044 --> 00:25:26.805]  But as Trump is tweeting today, he's saying, it's Comey, it's Mueller.
[00:25:27.245 --> 00:25:29.625]  They are criminals, not Jerome Corsi.
[00:25:30.746 --> 00:25:32.266]  And so he's telling it like it is.
[00:25:32.326 --> 00:25:35.046]  They are criminals who illegally spied on the campaign.
[00:25:35.066 --> 00:25:37.287]  They are criminals that sold us out to Russia.
[00:25:37.527 --> 00:25:40.367]  They are criminals that are trying to overturn the election of the president.
[00:25:40.767 --> 00:25:41.368]  They are!
[00:25:41.548 --> 00:25:43.648]  And I cannot believe their chutzpah!
[00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.793]  It really is incredible that they are pushing ahead.
[00:25:48.893 --> 00:26:09.672]  You'll notice today the President in his tweets specifically pointing out the long, close relationship between Robert Mueller and James Comey, and also pointing out that the woman heading the investigation into Roger Stone, heading the investigation for the Mueller Group, is the former attorney for Hillary Clinton in the email case.
[00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:17.535]  And for the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering case, if that's not a stunning conflict of interest, I don't know what is.
[00:26:19.516 --> 00:26:26.501]  And of course, we are the ones that ferreted it out and pointed it out to the world that the former head lawyer for the Clinton Foundation is now the head prosecutor.
[00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:28.882]  I mean, Trump isn't even given this intel.
[00:26:28.963 --> 00:26:30.964]  We are the intel for America.
[00:26:31.444 --> 00:26:32.565]  Drudge Report is as well.
[00:26:32.845 --> 00:26:34.726]  So the Washington Post is attacking Drudge Report today.
[00:26:35.067 --> 00:26:35.987]  And I'm not bragging.
[00:26:36.087 --> 00:26:37.628]  I don't want to be in this elite club.
[00:26:37.648 --> 00:26:38.329]  I'm like a general.
[00:26:38.689 --> 00:26:40.912]  Walk around the front lines wearing my insignia.
[00:26:41.132 --> 00:26:42.113]  They're gunning for us.
[00:26:42.413 --> 00:26:44.476]  That's why we need your prayers and more.
[00:26:44.776 --> 00:26:47.339]  Well, big stuff obviously coming in the next week here, Roger.
[00:26:47.379 --> 00:26:48.440]  You're involved heavily in it.
[00:26:48.741 --> 00:26:49.341]  We salute you.
[00:26:49.381 --> 00:26:56.390]  Everybody should just be watching NewsWars.com and Infowars.com and StoneColdTruth.com because big stuff's coming next week.
[00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.351]  God bless you, Roger.
[00:26:58.109 --> 00:27:10.257]  Well, and join us today on The War Room at 5 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Central, where Dana Gertz is going to talk to us about the White House Christmas Party, incredible decorations put up by Melania, and a special report.
[00:27:10.837 --> 00:27:14.659]  Okay, and that's a little secret code, everybody, but the show starts at 3 p.m.
[00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:16.861]  Central, but Roger's always hosting in the second hour.
[00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:18.402]  All right, thank you so much, Roger.
[00:27:19.042 --> 00:27:19.563]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:27:19.943 --> 00:27:24.646]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's just stop right there and let you know that
[00:27:27.546 --> 00:27:36.988]  I don't know if I want to talk about this on air at this time, and I'm not whining, but it's kind of like you're a ship out in the sea under attack, and you're like, we're under fire, we're under fire, it's serious fire.
[00:27:37.509 --> 00:27:40.349]  Okay, we got about six big torpedoes coming at us.
[00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:42.610]  Then we're going to report our last position to everybody.
[00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:47.371]  But let me just tell you, this country is in a total war right now for its survival.
[00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:50.332]  And we need your prayers, number one, and I mean that's number one.
[00:27:50.592 --> 00:27:54.033]  Please pray for me, pray for my family, pray for this whole crew, please pray for M4 Wars.
[00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:58.274]  Please pray for our providence, our provision, and our protection.
[00:27:58.474 --> 00:28:00.555]  If that's God's will, please pray for us.
[00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:03.538]  And please spread the articles, the videos, the news.
[00:28:03.798 --> 00:28:06.700]  Without you getting it out there, what's the point of doing this and risking our lives?
[00:28:07.962 --> 00:28:14.387]  The enemy wants us shut down because they know our trajectory of what we've been doing has already given America and the world huge victories.
[00:28:15.896 --> 00:28:17.677]  But we've got to push that much harder.
[00:28:18.037 --> 00:28:20.998]  And that's why we've got free shipping store-wide until Christmas.
[00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:26.461]  Double Patriot points on your next order instead of 5 points on every dollar, it's 10 cents on every dollar towards your next order.
[00:28:27.241 --> 00:28:29.902]  And the biggest deal is, free shipping, 50-75% off in every order!
[00:28:29.922 --> 00:28:30.823]  It'll be a $10 order!
[00:28:30.883 --> 00:28:31.303]  A $7 order!
[00:28:31.323 --> 00:28:32.624]  You gotta set it as low as $7!
[00:28:36.522 --> 00:28:39.944]  You can get a free high-quality t-shirt that says we're all Alex Jones.
[00:28:40.244 --> 00:28:41.825]  Don't censor me with a Gadsden flag.
[00:28:42.185 --> 00:28:43.165]  Very handsome shirt.
[00:28:43.825 --> 00:28:44.746]  You can pick your size.
[00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:45.546]  That's free!
[00:28:45.886 --> 00:28:48.388]  So with the free shipping and that, most orders are a lost leader.
[00:28:48.628 --> 00:28:57.172]  But I want to get this all out to folks and give you a great place to shop online that's way better than brick-and-mortar and way better than Amazon and that also supports America and a future.
[00:28:57.732 --> 00:29:01.494]  Everybody, do your shopping for Christmas at infowarestore.com.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.982]  We're here because you've stood with us.
[00:29:15.523 --> 00:29:17.365]  And it's been amazing.
[00:29:17.465 --> 00:29:20.568]  And because of what you've done as an audience, we've changed the world.
[00:29:20.709 --> 00:29:25.674]  We fundamentally expose globalism as this planetary world government authoritarian system.
[00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:26.975]  And so they denied it existed.
[00:29:27.055 --> 00:29:31.760]  But now they're out in the open admitting it exists because they were unsuccessful in stopping a debate about it.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:38.929]  So now they've just moved directly to total censorship of any nationalist, of any Christian, of any conservative that exposes the scam that they're involved in.
[00:29:38.989 --> 00:29:49.502]  And there's a clip up on DrudgeReport.com where Alexander Cortez says it's inevitable that global warming governance, the global governance of global warming, dragging everything you do, will create economic, social and
[00:29:50.083 --> 00:29:50.784]  Racial justice.
[00:29:51.104 --> 00:30:02.033]  We can use the transition to 100% renewable energy as the vehicle to truly deliver and establish economic, social, and racial justice in the United States of America.
[00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:06.537]  That is our proposal and that is what we are here to do.
[00:30:06.977 --> 00:30:12.182]  So that's these big carbon exchanges owned by Al Gore and Laura Rothschild and Barack Obama.
[00:30:12.202 --> 00:30:13.443]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:30:13.483 --> 00:30:16.786]  Being paid by everybody that engages in any human activity.
[00:30:16.966 --> 00:30:17.687]  Everything's taxed.
[00:30:17.847 --> 00:30:18.128]  Everything.
[00:30:18.228 --> 00:30:19.209]  Being born is taxed.
[00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:28.778]  And you pay this new superclass of Bernie Sanders types to fly around on their private jets while they tell you they're saving the earth and saving the atmosphere with all these taxes.
[00:30:29.218 --> 00:30:36.483]  While they're carrying out geoengineering operations that actually could collapse the atmosphere, all the scientists that have looked at it say.
[00:30:36.643 --> 00:30:37.924]  So, they're collapsing it.
[00:30:37.944 --> 00:30:42.007]  They're going to bring the taxes in and then later say, oh, we acted too little too late.
[00:30:42.227 --> 00:30:44.069]  You can see the whole diabolical plan.
[00:30:44.169 --> 00:30:47.351]  Mike Adams has written a masterstroke report that everyone should read.
[00:30:47.491 --> 00:30:49.733]  It's at naturalnews.com and infowars.com.
[00:30:49.853 --> 00:30:51.454]  Terraforming has begun.
[00:30:51.594 --> 00:30:55.657]  Global dimming is a plot to exterminate humanity by terraforming the atmosphere.
[00:30:56.978 --> 00:31:03.343]  This is reality, and I'm begging you to get the report and get out to everyone you know.
[00:31:03.483 --> 00:31:08.808]  That said, it is your purchase of the products at InfoWareStore.com that make all this possible.
[00:31:09.008 --> 00:31:16.214]  And so now, until the 19th of December, everyone that orders in the continental United States is guaranteed to get their package before Christmas.
[00:31:16.494 --> 00:31:22.259]  And we also have store-wide free shipping, 50 to 75% off, and double Patriot points, meaning after your order,
[00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:25.300]  It goes in your little account where you get five, usually.
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:30.063]  Now you get 10 points or 10 cents off each dollar on your next purchase.
[00:31:30.263 --> 00:31:30.823]  It's a big deal.
[00:31:30.883 --> 00:31:33.564]  So take advantage of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of products.
[00:31:33.665 --> 00:31:34.545]  Everything is on sale.
[00:31:34.705 --> 00:31:39.127]  Storewide free shipping at InfoWareStore.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:31:39.628 --> 00:31:41.689]  But without you, we won't be able to operate in the future.
[00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:42.409]  I know you know that.
[00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:46.251]  So I also wanted to thank you all for your support in making the InfoWare
[00:31:46.431 --> 00:31:50.562]  Possible the 12 days of Christmas are running through right up until the 19th.
[00:31:50.943 --> 00:31:52.226]  Please take advantage of it.
[00:31:52.267 --> 00:31:53.410]  Without you, we'll be shut down.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.461]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:24.965]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse Reglanone product.

[00:33:05.876 --> 00:33:12.121]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.749 --> 00:33:26.693]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:44.808 --> 00:33:53.770]  I got up this morning at 5.30 and I went to InfoWars.com and I noticed it hadn't been updated yet.
[00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:54.410]  No big deal.
[00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:55.591]  It was about to be updated.
[00:33:55.691 --> 00:33:57.971]  They updated over in England at about 6 a.m.
[00:33:57.991 --> 00:34:01.592]  I went to DrudgeReport.com and of course it had been updated.
[00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:08.634]  And I don't know how Drudge and one other guy were up 24-7, but they are.
[00:34:09.195 --> 00:34:10.216]  And it was this little Jim.
[00:34:10.836 --> 00:34:13.738]  Tucker, Trump hasn't kept any of his promises.
[00:34:18.122 --> 00:34:21.044]  And then I went on to read the article with the German newspaper.
[00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:30.832]  And it gave me a kind of a frustration headache as I was drinking my coffee at 530.
[00:34:31.172 --> 00:34:33.034]  I read the whole article.
[00:34:35.188 --> 00:34:37.089]  And I know what Tucker Carlson's trying to do with this.
[00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.110]  And I think some of the points he makes are very, very valid.
[00:34:42.911 --> 00:34:43.631]  But some aren't.
[00:34:45.812 --> 00:34:49.433]  And I think this is a little bit of him hedging his bets in case Trump goes down.
[00:34:52.254 --> 00:34:54.435]  And let me tell you, Carlson's really smart.
[00:34:55.855 --> 00:34:58.316]  And I respect him, and I think he's the smartest person on television.
[00:34:59.056 --> 00:35:00.257]  I really like Sean Hannity, too.
[00:35:02.113 --> 00:35:03.374]  They're both very influential.
[00:35:03.534 --> 00:35:10.357]  You know, they had the big national poll of media and they found Matt Drudge is the most influential, and then a few other people will talk about that later.
[00:35:11.718 --> 00:35:14.299]  And the Washington Post, everybody attacked Matt Drudge, all out of jealousy.
[00:35:14.319 --> 00:35:17.881]  How about biting the hand that feeds you?
[00:35:18.041 --> 00:35:18.601]  Good Lord.
[00:35:19.241 --> 00:35:19.641]  Anyways.
[00:35:22.823 --> 00:35:24.624]  This article I could talk about for two hours.
[00:35:25.484 --> 00:35:26.525]  Not because it's about Drudge.
[00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.046]  It's about the lies of corporate media.
[00:35:30.555 --> 00:35:37.542]  Because everything they say about drudge is what they're doing themselves.
[00:35:41.225 --> 00:35:43.767]  They call him fake news and this purveyor of evil.
[00:35:45.389 --> 00:35:50.274]  I guess that's kind of true in a way because he links more to mainstream media than independent media.
[00:35:51.345 --> 00:35:53.287]  In a weird backhanded way, that's true.
[00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:54.688]  I'm not saying Drudge is bad to do that.
[00:35:54.728 --> 00:35:55.929]  He's showing all the different angles.
[00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:08.101]  But Drudge is just this portal into what he thinks is interesting and people tend to resonate with that because Drudge is a smart guy, but you read this and it's just like it's a war on reality.
[00:36:08.161 --> 00:36:09.322]  It's a war on logic.
[00:36:11.144 --> 00:36:13.446]  Drudge links to the Washington Post almost every day.
[00:36:16.118 --> 00:36:22.563]  And they even admit in major studies, like half the New York Times and Washington Post, traffic is routinely from Drudge.
[00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:28.108]  I mean, ours is like 10% because he links to us every once in a while.
[00:36:28.508 --> 00:36:30.530]  These people are incredible.
[00:36:32.051 --> 00:36:32.972]  Again, Drudge is horrible.
[00:36:33.012 --> 00:36:34.093]  He links to evil.
[00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:35.034]  He's a bad person.
[00:36:35.354 --> 00:36:36.675]  And by the way, he's the reason we exist.
[00:36:39.237 --> 00:36:40.138]  It's kind of like Trump.
[00:36:41.343 --> 00:36:47.824]  Corporate media had absolutely no views, it was totally going bankrupt, but when they cover him, suddenly they get a dead cat bounce and it keeps him alive.
[00:36:48.784 --> 00:36:50.105]  They, of course, want him destroyed.
[00:36:50.465 --> 00:36:52.965]  The article is, Drudge takes the Oscar for cluelessness.
[00:36:55.486 --> 00:37:01.527]  Oh yeah, that's why one guy's more successful than Jeff Bezos pumping $600 million a year into the Washington Post.
[00:37:03.207 --> 00:37:06.528]  That's why he's got, what, 20, 30 times, I don't know, the traffic of the Washington Post?
[00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:08.835]  Because he's smart and you're not?
[00:37:08.895 --> 00:37:10.216]  I mean, or he's not a traitor?
[00:37:10.697 --> 00:37:11.177]  And you are?
[00:37:11.197 --> 00:37:12.698]  I mean, oh!
[00:37:13.499 --> 00:37:20.224]  But see, they want him to not have a platform, they want me to not have a platform, they don't want Tucker Carlson, they really hate him.
[00:37:22.066 --> 00:37:31.754]  They don't want him to have a platform because we're independent, we're smarter than them, and we're not traitors, and that reminds them of what unpopular, lying scum they are.
[00:37:33.507 --> 00:37:34.228]  But I digress.
[00:37:34.928 --> 00:37:38.491]  That's why then I see an article like this, this interview with Carlson.
[00:37:43.696 --> 00:37:47.940]  And it's frustrating because I know why Carlson did this.
[00:37:49.341 --> 00:37:50.022]  He didn't tell me.
[00:37:51.063 --> 00:37:51.363]  I know.
[00:37:51.663 --> 00:37:52.484]  It's frustration.
[00:37:54.085 --> 00:37:55.867]  And from his perspective, he's right.
[00:37:57.159 --> 00:38:13.804]  But if you pull back from the perspective of not wanting instant gratification and looking at what Trump's working with, it's like Trump's built a spaceship with some gravel and some tin cans in the backyard that just got off the ground.
[00:38:14.144 --> 00:38:19.966]  Now it's on fire at about 50,000 feet and about to blow up, but you're still like, boy, he sure tried, didn't he?
[00:38:20.306 --> 00:38:21.807]  And then it's a reflection on us!
[00:38:25.714 --> 00:38:36.364]  I mean, if you don't admire trailblazers and people that go against the grain and deliver, even partially, it'd be like one guy from the NFL playing 11 others.
[00:38:36.384 --> 00:38:38.746]  10 to 1.
[00:38:38.786 --> 00:38:39.487]  11 to 1.
[00:38:40.668 --> 00:38:43.751]  And Trump only gets the ball down the field 50 yards.
[00:38:43.951 --> 00:38:46.513]  And since he didn't get it across the line, he sucks.
[00:38:47.614 --> 00:38:50.537]  No, he's fighting an uphill battle.
[00:38:59.807 --> 00:39:03.469]  See, that's why it's hard to cover a story like this, because there's so many facets to it.
[00:39:03.489 --> 00:39:07.992]  I can take one line that Tucker says, look at both angles of it for an hour, just one line of the story.
[00:39:08.693 --> 00:39:10.794]  Like, Trump doesn't really know what he's doing!
[00:39:11.154 --> 00:39:14.316]  He doesn't know how to control Washington, and that's why he can't get anything done!
[00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:18.218]  Well, because he's not part of them, that's why he's gotten so much done!
[00:39:18.999 --> 00:39:22.441]  Because he's not part of the good old boy network, because he really is the President!
[00:39:22.901 --> 00:39:25.103]  He really is returning power to the Oval Office!
[00:39:25.423 --> 00:39:26.544]  It's revolutionary!
[00:39:26.804 --> 00:39:28.485]  That alone, the nationalism!
[00:39:29.726 --> 00:39:30.246]  Here's the problem.
[00:39:31.286 --> 00:39:36.828]  I don't have an hour to set aside for Trump's accomplishments, because there's different lists out there.
[00:39:37.128 --> 00:39:39.769]  Some are a thousand long, some are 500 long.
[00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:42.269]  I've got one that's 280-something long here.
[00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:52.592]  And I was trying to look at it this morning at home, and by then my kids were up at 6.15 running around and we started getting breakfast going and things, and I had to stop looking at it.
[00:39:57.734 --> 00:40:05.039]  It made me sick to my stomach at the same time of giving me a headache because I realized we really are an instant gratification culture.
[00:40:06.857 --> 00:40:14.703]  And you look at everything Trump's been able to do, despite what he's working with, and the fact that more of us aren't involved in the field is why we may lose.
[00:40:15.263 --> 00:40:19.667]  You know, I've sent my reporters down, two different groups of them, to Mexico, U.S.
[00:40:19.707 --> 00:40:31.876]  border, Tijuana, San Diego, and every time they're there, they're outnumbered about 21 by leftist and antifa scumbags spitting in their face and cussing and yelling at them, where are the people
[00:40:34.824 --> 00:40:39.127]  Going down there as citizen journalist to show what's going on and to have the numbers.
[00:40:39.507 --> 00:40:44.711]  Oh, well, we're conservatives or we're Christians or we're business owners or we're parents, you know, we don't do that.
[00:40:44.771 --> 00:40:46.652]  We leave that to Alex Jones.
[00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:48.113]  Well, guess what?
[00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:49.374]  They just banned my ass.
[00:40:50.055 --> 00:40:51.736]  They can't stop all of you.
[00:40:51.776 --> 00:40:53.037]  So I'm not on your butt here.
[00:40:54.858 --> 00:40:56.279]  I'm just simply saying to everybody.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.303]  We don't have any room to criticize what Trump's done.
[00:41:01.703 --> 00:41:02.204]  It's not about
[00:41:03.035 --> 00:41:04.656]  Prostrating myself before Trump.
[00:41:06.237 --> 00:41:06.918]  It's the opposite.
[00:41:07.378 --> 00:41:15.344]  It's about looking at what we're doing, all of us, to fight these globalists and their scumbag minions who are such a clear and present danger.
[00:41:16.665 --> 00:41:23.770]  And it's about realizing that if we all just lift a finger, collectively, these parasites will be off our back.
[00:41:24.551 --> 00:41:24.891]  Like that.
[00:41:25.531 --> 00:41:26.752]  It is our acquiescence.
[00:41:27.613 --> 00:41:29.034]  It is our going along with the system.
[00:41:29.494 --> 00:41:31.956]  It is our passiveness that has allowed this to happen.
[00:41:33.137 --> 00:41:35.559]  Here's what I'm going to do, because I've got such earth-shattering news.
[00:41:35.579 --> 00:41:39.863]  I mean, this is all just totally bombshell and totally positive in many ways.
[00:41:41.904 --> 00:41:44.367]  I'm going to start the next hour and do the Tucker Carlson thing.
[00:41:44.387 --> 00:41:46.829]  I just did some preludes, but I'm going to laser focus and do this.
[00:41:47.509 --> 00:41:49.711]  I'm going to do it in maybe two segments, segment two and segment three.
[00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:54.055]  And then Mark Dice is coming up and Dr. Nick Magich and a lot more.
[00:41:56.577 --> 00:41:57.938]  I'm at the big world news when we come back.
[00:42:00.868 --> 00:42:13.456]  But just this China thing alone, with what they did arresting the deputy head of one of the most powerful people in China, his daughter, who is a spy chief.
[00:42:13.556 --> 00:42:14.537]  She has three different names.
[00:42:15.258 --> 00:42:18.219]  They've caught the company putting spy chips on all their devices.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.862]  The devices are illegal inside U.S.
[00:42:21.882 --> 00:42:22.522]  government buildings.
[00:42:24.584 --> 00:42:26.405]  And they're all asking, oh, why'd she get arrested?
[00:42:26.425 --> 00:42:27.926]  Well, we know damn well why she did.
[00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:33.431]  They're trying to put up 5G all over the U.S.
[00:42:34.692 --> 00:42:36.993]  that will break into every device in the country.
[00:42:37.013 --> 00:42:38.933]  We're under Chinese Communist attack.
[00:42:39.313 --> 00:42:45.056]  And Trump isn't a traitor, and he just said no to the whole double-cross, and that's why Hillary and all these traitors are crapping their drawers.
[00:42:45.396 --> 00:42:49.637]  Because they're so desperate to get this lion out of here before the world wakes up.
[00:42:50.278 --> 00:42:55.079]  Instead, most conservatives are talking about how the lion, surrounded by 500 hyenas, can do a better job!
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.801]  I say all of us get in a fight with the lion, because we're lions too!
[00:43:03.285 --> 00:43:09.991]  Six months ago, M4's life came out with a reformulated, even stronger, even better bone broth for
[00:43:11.707 --> 00:43:17.133]  And it is the strongest, purest, most high quality bone broth system out there on the market.
[00:43:17.153 --> 00:43:26.843]  We made sure it was the best and it's filled with chaga mushroom, it's filled with bee pollen, high quality turmeric for your joints, for your body, for your muscles, for your bones.
[00:43:27.203 --> 00:43:29.365]  This is the ultimate superfood.
[00:43:29.705 --> 00:43:34.851]  There's tons of research on basic bone broth, particularly from chicken bones and that's what this has in it.
[00:43:35.271 --> 00:43:40.973]  This is concentrated, so it's way, way, way, way stronger than grandma's chicken noodle soup.
[00:43:40.993 --> 00:43:45.934]  You put the other superfoods in there, it's something you simply have to experience yourself.
[00:43:46.074 --> 00:43:47.014]  It is phenomenal.
[00:43:47.255 --> 00:43:54.077]  You need to go to InfoWarsLife.com and read the third-party reviews yourself to see what people are experiencing.
[00:43:54.257 --> 00:43:57.478]  So, we had the new formulation come in about six months ago.
[00:43:57.578 --> 00:43:58.798]  It sold out very, very quickly.
[00:43:58.818 --> 00:44:02.139]  So I put in a huge order.
[00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:07.323]  And we still have 3,000 or 4,000 canisters of this left.
[00:44:07.783 --> 00:44:14.305]  And before the end of the year, so we don't have to pay inventory tax, this is another one of the great items we're offering at cost.
[00:44:15.345 --> 00:44:16.686]  It's 50% off right now, $19.95.
[00:44:17.166 --> 00:44:21.288]  Leading competitors are $50, $60, $70 aren't as strong.
[00:44:21.728 --> 00:44:22.728]  It's normally a great deal at $39.
[00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:26.509]  We usually discount down to about $29.95.
[00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:30.051]  This is $19.95, but this is why this is so special.
[00:44:31.011 --> 00:44:34.113]  You're getting a free gift of a t-shirt.
[00:44:35.734 --> 00:44:37.174]  You're also getting free shipping.
[00:44:37.955 --> 00:44:41.317]  You're also getting double Patriot points instead of five points on the dollar.
[00:44:41.597 --> 00:44:43.438]  Ten cents on the dollar for your next order.
[00:44:43.838 --> 00:44:51.062]  You add all that together and we're losing about five dollars on every order of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:44:51.182 --> 00:44:52.863]  But I want you to try it.
[00:44:53.623 --> 00:44:58.766]  I want you to see how amazing it is because I believe you will then basically be hooked for life like I am.
[00:44:59.815 --> 00:45:02.758]  You talk about strength, stamina, endurance, focus.
[00:45:03.459 --> 00:45:04.199]  There's nothing like it.
[00:45:04.279 --> 00:45:06.261]  The ancients all knew about the power of the bones.
[00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:11.346]  They ground up the bones of horses and cows and chickens and put it in their bread.
[00:45:11.947 --> 00:45:14.970]  And in modern day, that's been taken out the last hundred years out of the bread.
[00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:18.593]  So there's a lot of places we're not getting the essence that's in the bone.
[00:45:18.994 --> 00:45:19.634]  The marrow.
[00:45:20.735 --> 00:45:28.181]  The things that are in the bone structure itself, but it's all in here in Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:28.561 --> 00:45:33.646]  It is the strongest formulation out there, the best, and it has the added benefit of funding the InfoWars.
[00:45:33.706 --> 00:45:36.768]  So, all supplies last right up until Christmas.
[00:45:37.068 --> 00:45:37.929]  We're gonna sell out quick.
[00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:42.673]  Ultimate Bone Broth is, right now, the best deal you'll ever find, period.
[00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:47.957]  And you get the free t-shirt, free shipping, and more at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:45:50.539 --> 00:45:57.021]  Alright, there's a couple of really big things that I forgot to tell you, and Rob who's shooting this ad reminded me, because I don't use a script.
[00:45:58.121 --> 00:46:00.862]  We have store-wide free shipping, not just on Ultimate Bone Brother.
[00:46:01.462 --> 00:46:05.683]  And we have 50 to 75% off across the entire store.

[00:46:12.725 --> 00:46:18.187]  And double Patriot points, instead of 5 cents on every dollar, it's 10 cents on every dollar on your future purchase.
[00:46:18.767 --> 00:46:19.688]  This is a big deal.
[00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:30.297]  X2, X3, Super Metal Vitality, Rainforce Plus, BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and dozens of other amazing formulas at the lowest prices ever.
[00:46:30.838 --> 00:46:37.284]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds, and support the InfoLore and get great products all at the same time.
[00:46:37.844 --> 00:46:38.545]  Everything 50 to 75% off.

[00:46:42.408 --> 00:46:44.791]  We're clearing out everything so we don't get hit with the inventory tax.
[00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:48.214]  And it's a big thank you to all of you who supported us over the years.
[00:46:48.574 --> 00:46:50.796]  And I think you'll love these products that you haven't tried so much.
[00:46:51.036 --> 00:46:54.680]  You'll become a regular customer and help fund us into the future under Glovel's attack.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:55.741]  But again, thank you.
[00:46:55.781 --> 00:46:56.602]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[00:46:56.642 --> 00:46:57.182]  God bless you.
[00:46:57.483 --> 00:46:59.024]  And thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:46:59.224 --> 00:47:01.146]  Without you, we would be shut down a long time ago.
[00:47:01.286 --> 00:47:01.927]  So I salute you.
[00:47:06.867 --> 00:47:09.480]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.378 --> 00:47:33.820]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.221]  Well, so does he.
[00:47:35.701 --> 00:47:40.206]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:46.933 --> 00:47:53.940]  You know how effective Trump's been by how much they attack him, how much they demonize him, and how much they go after anybody that stands with him.
[00:47:55.857 --> 00:47:57.778]  So, it's not a pain for me.
[00:47:58.439 --> 00:47:59.440]  It's not a sacrifice.
[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.043]  It's a real pleasure to be persecuted right alongside President Trump.
[00:48:05.124 --> 00:48:09.367]  And that's the attitude we've all got to have if we're going to defeat this thing for our children.
[00:48:09.727 --> 00:48:11.988]  We have to want to be in the fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:14.790]  If you don't want to be in the fight, you might as well get the hell out of the fight.
[00:48:15.471 --> 00:48:18.653]  And just roll over and let this globalist system totally dominate you.
[00:48:19.674 --> 00:48:19.894]  Okay.
[00:48:22.054 --> 00:48:24.736]  Just so you know what's coming up, and I'm going to start getting into it right now.
[00:48:24.956 --> 00:48:26.558]  I'm going to hit what's really going on with the economy.
[00:48:28.379 --> 00:48:39.749]  I'm going to hit the biggest news, what's happening in China, and how that ties into Iran, and Pakistan, and India, and Afghanistan.
[00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:44.893]  I'm going to look more at what's happening in Europe in the fall.
[00:48:44.933 --> 00:48:45.974]  The EU, it's coming down.
[00:48:48.263 --> 00:48:52.746]  It turns out one of our listeners got the Foyer request to release more of the MKUltra documents.
[00:48:53.466 --> 00:48:54.427]  So that's in the news today.
[00:48:54.447 --> 00:48:56.028]  I've got some inside baseball for you.
[00:48:57.389 --> 00:48:59.631]  On that, talk about next week's news today.
[00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:03.193]  I'm going to give a little bit of tidbit on what's coming next on that front, and I'm going to stop right there.
[00:49:03.213 --> 00:49:12.559]  And then I'm going to look at the jealousy and hatred of the fake media against the real media.
[00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:16.782]  In this Washington Post sickening article, Drudge takes the Oscar for clueless.
[00:49:18.368 --> 00:49:23.290]  And also, the Clinton Foundation whistleblowers have come forward with hundreds of pages of evidence.
[00:49:24.491 --> 00:49:27.812]  And it is extremely damning of pay-to-play, comingling of funds.
[00:49:27.832 --> 00:49:28.972]  You ask, well, why wasn't anything done?
[00:49:29.453 --> 00:49:35.775]  Because Comey and Mueller and Rosenstein were there, not asleep at the switch, but actively involved.
[00:49:39.997 --> 00:49:41.978]  Actively involved in all of this.
[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:56.683]  So, let's look at national security and how the nation's under attack and how corporate media and the universities openly say that the country existing itself is a bad thing.
[00:49:56.703 --> 00:50:02.925]  Because you're all treated to the governor of New York saying we were never a great nation, we'll never be a great nation.
[00:50:05.046 --> 00:50:08.346]  And you've all been treated to similar statements by Bill Maher.
[00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:12.248]  And you see all the news channels.
[00:50:12.268 --> 00:50:13.628]  We did a compilation a few weeks ago.
[00:50:15.043 --> 00:50:17.384]  In the last few months, did you hear the word he said?
[00:50:18.064 --> 00:50:19.065]  He said nationalist.
[00:50:19.085 --> 00:50:20.005]  How dirty, how evil.
[00:50:20.045 --> 00:50:21.526]  Just the country existing is bad.
[00:50:23.007 --> 00:50:24.827]  So here comes the private Federal Reserve.
[00:50:24.847 --> 00:50:35.972]  According to estimates from 1913, they admitted in news reports then that about 80% of its stockholders are foreign EU holders today.
[00:50:35.992 --> 00:50:37.113]  It's the same people.
[00:50:40.822 --> 00:50:44.043]  And so, the private federal reserve raises interest rates seven times on us.
[00:50:44.444 --> 00:50:45.344]  Never did under Obama.
[00:50:46.324 --> 00:50:47.845]  And then the economy starts going down some.
[00:50:48.906 --> 00:50:50.946]  And then, yesterday they say, you know what?
[00:50:51.427 --> 00:50:53.187]  We may not do rate hikes for the next year.
[00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:54.148]  And the stock market...
[00:50:55.663 --> 00:50:58.724]  Gets back most of his losses for the year, making the year in the black.
[00:50:59.505 --> 00:51:05.387]  Oh, and then, magically, ladies and gentlemen, they come out today and say, oh, we had a good jobs number report come in.
[00:51:05.428 --> 00:51:06.068]  Actually, it wasn't.
[00:51:06.808 --> 00:51:08.229]  It was down from what they thought, about a third.
[00:51:08.609 --> 00:51:10.170]  And so we're going to go ahead and raise interest rates again.
[00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:12.071]  Why not just keep your mouth shut?
[00:51:12.131 --> 00:51:12.311]  No.
[00:51:12.671 --> 00:51:23.536]  They want to manipulate this economy now because they know no president going into his re-election bid, other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
[00:51:24.704 --> 00:51:26.846]  has ever won in a recession or a depression.
[00:51:27.266 --> 00:51:28.647]  Jimmy Carter didn't, did he?
[00:51:30.028 --> 00:51:35.193]  And so they know that, and they've got op-eds out there saying, let's not help the economy.
[00:51:36.253 --> 00:51:40.837]  You've heard Bill Maher and others, let's hurt it so people don't give Trump credit.
[00:51:43.339 --> 00:51:47.022]  Foreign armies couldn't do that to us, but you see, we've got a rigged economy.
[00:51:47.363 --> 00:51:49.905]  The president tried to rig it a little for you, a little for me.
[00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:53.484]  It's command and control.
[00:51:53.564 --> 00:51:56.005]  He said, hey, China, you can get fat off of us.
[00:51:56.045 --> 00:51:56.826]  Just give us something.
[00:51:57.446 --> 00:51:58.607]  They said, no, you get nothing.
[00:51:58.807 --> 00:51:59.968]  So he said, OK, I'll take it all away.
[00:51:59.988 --> 00:52:01.029]  They said, OK, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:52:01.409 --> 00:52:02.369]  We'll give you a third.
[00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:04.771]  He said, no, I want half.
[00:52:05.972 --> 00:52:06.512]  Which is fair.
[00:52:07.733 --> 00:52:10.235]  You know, you and your brother go out for pizza.
[00:52:11.816 --> 00:52:14.277]  And you order a large pizza and you're going Dutch.
[00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.278]  You're going to split the money.
[00:52:17.842 --> 00:52:19.923]  And, they're six pieces.
[00:52:21.644 --> 00:52:23.565]  You get three, he gets three.
[00:52:26.227 --> 00:52:31.710]  So, the Dow fell 400 points, breaking decline for the wild week to more than 3%.
[00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.311]  CNBC.
[00:52:35.592 --> 00:52:37.233]  Jobs growth cools in November.
[00:52:37.373 --> 00:52:38.914]  Monthly wages gain the most.
[00:52:39.054 --> 00:52:45.098]  But, you see that number, it cooled, but they say, the Federal Reserve came out today and said, oh no,
[00:52:47.316 --> 00:52:47.856]  Oh no!
[00:52:50.158 --> 00:52:51.139]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:51.179 --> 00:52:52.980]  This is good numbers, even though it's not.
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:57.543]  We're going to keep trying to push America under the water and drown this recovery.
[00:53:00.765 --> 00:53:01.765]  All in your face.
[00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.928]  Completely diabolical.
[00:53:05.808 --> 00:53:11.532]  Because at the same time, China's had 0% interest for decades, 10% growth rates a year, state-run
[00:53:13.547 --> 00:53:29.834]  And our own media is cheerleading that, how dare Trump say we had a month-long moratorium on the trade war, when he knew the Justice Department was about to arrest the number two person at the second largest telecom cell phone company in the world, and why is he doing this outrageous police state activity?
[00:53:32.755 --> 00:53:37.377]  You know, they catch a Russian spy stealing some stuff, they give him life in prison.
[00:53:37.597 --> 00:53:40.318]  They catch an Israeli spy like Jonathan Pollard, life in prison, good.
[00:53:41.278 --> 00:53:43.059]  But boy, you're a chai-com!
[00:53:44.793 --> 00:53:53.480]  And your company's been caught from Australia, to Japan, to South Korea, to Vietnam, to England.
[00:53:55.762 --> 00:54:00.526]  To the UK wide, no one will take these phones into their country.
[00:54:00.566 --> 00:54:04.029]  You can't sell them because they're government spy devices.
[00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:07.632]  And look, ours have already got the capability and it goes on.
[00:54:07.912 --> 00:54:09.333]  But this is state run, baby.
[00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:11.615]  And it's known and they do it.
[00:54:11.715 --> 00:54:14.257]  They break in to your Wi-Fi system.
[00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:17.259]  They scan with a raw feed your passcodes.
[00:54:17.279 --> 00:54:18.080]  They have keyloggers.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.162]  And it's all sent back with your IP address to the motherland.
[00:54:22.096 --> 00:54:24.618]  And the biggest cyber army the world has ever seen.
[00:54:25.038 --> 00:54:30.563]  They've got 10 million people full time in the cyber army and another 100 million in auxiliary.
[00:54:30.923 --> 00:54:34.066]  This is in the news that are given jobs in mass hack attacks.
[00:54:35.367 --> 00:54:37.329]  And you've got these phones proliferating.
[00:54:37.649 --> 00:54:40.572]  Already the second biggest phone digital maker in the world.
[00:54:41.733 --> 00:54:46.315]  Apple's now moved there earlier this year, probably last year, in early 2018.
[00:54:46.655 --> 00:54:48.796]  They've given them the iCloud keys.
[00:54:49.437 --> 00:54:56.440]  That's why Tim Cook got so pissed when he knew I was hammering that to the President, because he got specifically asked about that by the President.
[00:54:59.401 --> 00:55:00.442]  Of course, it was in the news.
[00:55:00.462 --> 00:55:02.803]  It was in Bloomberg six months after I told you.
[00:55:02.843 --> 00:55:06.705]  But see, they don't like the fact that so many times, where is it first?
[00:55:06.925 --> 00:55:07.285]  Right here.
[00:55:10.276 --> 00:55:12.076]  So, we'll cover this more next hour.
[00:55:12.337 --> 00:55:12.657]  U.S.
[00:55:12.717 --> 00:55:15.437]  accused of, quote, declaration of war.
[00:55:17.678 --> 00:55:18.498]  That's close quote.
[00:55:18.538 --> 00:55:19.178]  That's the Chinese.
[00:55:19.658 --> 00:55:23.339]  Against China as the stock market teeters on the precipice of disaster.
[00:55:23.679 --> 00:55:25.100]  Michael Stoddard, Economic Collapse blog.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.280]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.000]  Here's another one.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:29.881]  Why are countries banning Huawei?
[00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.782]  That's Al Jazeera, because it's got spy chips in it.
[00:55:34.142 --> 00:55:34.942]  It's a security risk.
[00:55:36.295 --> 00:55:39.317]  Huawei's 5G ambitions suffer another big setback.
[00:55:39.337 --> 00:55:40.999]  They were going to be the biggest network in the U.S.
[00:55:41.399 --> 00:55:42.740]  Chinese government run!
[00:55:44.882 --> 00:55:54.049]  Every American firm doing business in China now vulnerable after Huawei's number two arrested.
[00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:58.532]  China likened CFO arrest to declaration of war.
[00:55:58.652 --> 00:56:00.053]  Ben Warren, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:00.093 --> 00:56:04.737]  Huawei's exec's arrest opens a new front in the U.S.-China trade war.
[00:56:06.786 --> 00:56:08.027]  What have we been begging Trump to do?
[00:56:08.107 --> 00:56:09.487]  Go after the Chinese Commie agents?
[00:56:09.507 --> 00:56:10.548]  Well, why play games?
[00:56:11.848 --> 00:56:18.231]  Why not grab the chief operating officer, number two of their daddy, who's in the top three or four of the Commie's party?
[00:56:18.491 --> 00:56:20.492]  Some say he may be more powerful than Xi.
[00:56:22.113 --> 00:56:23.413]  Well, we just grabbed his daughter!
[00:56:23.934 --> 00:56:24.354]  Good!
[00:56:24.434 --> 00:56:26.855]  You're shooting your mouth off about nuclear war this week?
[00:56:27.235 --> 00:56:30.517]  How you'll nuke us over the weekend while Trump was down there with you?
[00:56:32.077 --> 00:56:33.418]  And now your daughter's been grabbed!
[00:56:34.605 --> 00:56:36.245]  You want us to do what we did like we did in Japan?
[00:56:36.285 --> 00:56:37.165]  We'll do it to you, buddy.
[00:56:37.986 --> 00:56:41.846]  Keep running your stupid mouth, you scumbag murderers.
[00:56:42.546 --> 00:56:43.727]  Keep feeding off your own people.
[00:56:44.007 --> 00:56:46.707]  Keep writing checks your ass can't cash.
[00:56:46.867 --> 00:56:50.588]  And I want to say that to all the cronies of the Democratic Party, all you traitors, all you scumbags.
[00:56:51.048 --> 00:56:53.168]  We have a very good chance of getting the country back.
[00:56:53.308 --> 00:56:59.649]  And I will assure you, not out of some vengeful thing, but out of necessity for our children, you're all going to get your asses prosecuted.
[00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:01.730]  I'd give it about 90% chance we win.
[00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:06.273]  May mean a nuclear war down the road, but we'll win in the end.
[00:57:07.133 --> 00:57:10.015]  Now, doesn't mean I don't have much of a chance of making it, but that's okay.
[00:57:10.396 --> 00:57:11.717]  See, that's the commitment we gotta have here.
[00:57:12.077 --> 00:57:14.279]  You're done, Dianne Feinstein.
[00:57:14.679 --> 00:57:16.480]  All of you traders are done.
[00:57:16.741 --> 00:57:17.781]  D-O-N-E.
[00:57:18.102 --> 00:57:18.442]  Done.
[00:57:19.223 --> 00:57:20.844]  Your new old order is dead on arrival.
[00:57:22.346 --> 00:57:24.527]  But I want to go into this fight the hardest I ever have.

[00:59:49.344 --> 00:59:51.304]  Again, you are the resistance.
[00:59:54.526 --> 01:00:00.448]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:16.459 --> 01:00:20.441]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:21.302 --> 01:00:22.722]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:00:22.983 --> 01:00:24.183]  Well so does he.
[01:00:24.643 --> 01:00:29.186]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.547 --> 01:00:43.454]  Ladies and gentlemen, next segment I'm getting into how Trump has delivered in royal flush spades.
[01:00:44.679 --> 01:00:46.460]  On the key priorities to save this country.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:53.062]  He's had goals that are psychological for the public to reclaim their identity.
[01:00:53.462 --> 01:01:01.084]  He's had physical and financial goals for the strategic defense and offensive operations of this country.
[01:01:02.345 --> 01:01:06.386]  And he's getting very good advice on many fronts.
[01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:14.200]  He's having trouble getting his domestic agenda implemented because of cowardice and idiocy and people being a bunch of scum and losers.
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:16.641]  We're going to talk about the next segment, but it doesn't matter.
[01:01:17.081 --> 01:01:22.025]  What he's promoting in the iconography is total victory.
[01:01:22.745 --> 01:01:25.147]  And that is the rest of the story.
[01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:26.128]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:01:26.708 --> 01:01:27.889]  We'll open the phones up after that.
[01:01:27.949 --> 01:01:29.450]  Mark Dice is going to be popping in.
[01:01:32.972 --> 01:01:36.895]  This China situation is so big
[01:01:38.348 --> 01:01:48.794]  And so, so dangerous, and so incredible, that I really am having trouble coming up with words to describe it.
[01:01:48.834 --> 01:02:02.401]  I mean, if you look at the job the globalists did on us, selling the country out, to mainly the Chi-Cops, they were the ones that were meant to break us in the end, and to take over Japan, and the Koreas, and Vietnam, and everything.
[01:02:03.782 --> 01:02:05.423]  But, they're running into a brick wall.
[01:02:08.137 --> 01:02:16.603]  And there were traitors in our government, obviously the Clintons, chief amongst them the Bushes, a close second, who helped set this up.
[01:02:20.276 --> 01:02:24.421]  And now you read the Pentagon, and you read the War College, this has nothing to do with Russia.
[01:02:24.981 --> 01:02:27.844]  Everyone knows they've cut their defense spending, they're in a defensive situation.
[01:02:28.305 --> 01:02:30.627]  There are certain elements trying to start a war from them, with them.
[01:02:31.368 --> 01:02:33.991]  A regional conflict to draw us off of China.
[01:02:34.632 --> 01:02:38.156]  And China's funding Iran, and Pakistan and others trying to do that.
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:41.561]  That's why we've got to move very, very quickly.
[01:02:41.601 --> 01:02:48.824]  But make no mistake, what Trump's doing is in the interest of humanity, the interest of America, and the interest of the poor people living in China and others.
[01:02:49.645 --> 01:02:59.169]  And everybody should be praying for President Trump instead of getting on the bandwagon to bash him and put him down and separate themselves from him because he's the man in the arena.
[01:03:05.734 --> 01:03:13.116]  China has ignored Trump's tweet on Iran, says business there will continue, even though they're in agreement with us, that if we put sanctions in, they'll be part of it.
[01:03:16.017 --> 01:03:23.639]  So this is all heating up, and reportedly the head of this big telecom got arrested for deals in Iran, that they violated U.S.
[01:03:23.679 --> 01:03:26.160]  trade laws by using money out of the U.S.
[01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:26.980]  to go there.
[01:03:28.921 --> 01:03:35.283]  It's all just a message that the Chinese will grab you.
[01:03:37.062 --> 01:03:38.723]  And the Chinese are already shooting at our ships.
[01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:40.783]  They're already running their mouths.
[01:03:41.543 --> 01:03:44.824]  They're going to end up just like Hitler and just like the Japanese.
[01:03:44.864 --> 01:03:45.225]  You watch.
[01:03:45.665 --> 01:03:52.467]  If they want that, if they think that there were just traitors in our government, there weren't.
[01:03:53.767 --> 01:04:01.049]  There were traitors, but they were allowed to operate by other people so that we'd know exactly who all the traitors were when this went down.
[01:04:01.069 --> 01:04:05.811]  Think we're going to leave a bunch of traitors in the government when we literally garotte you commies?
[01:04:07.116 --> 01:04:08.776]  So you're about to get it, China.
[01:04:08.796 --> 01:04:12.077]  Everybody better decide which side they're on right now.
[01:04:12.097 --> 01:04:14.338]  That's why all these globalists are so scared of Trump.
[01:04:14.358 --> 01:04:19.039]  Probably have London Guardian reports saying if the world gets destroyed, blame Alex Jones.
[01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:19.879]  He got Trump elected.
[01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:20.899]  No, this audience did.
[01:04:21.239 --> 01:04:21.740]  And you know what?
[01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:22.500]  Trump's for real.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:27.301]  So all you wimps, who wanted to run the white flag up to the chi-coms,
[01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:29.771]  And piss all over yourselves.
[01:04:30.312 --> 01:04:33.594]  We gave China and all these other groups a lot of chances.
[01:04:34.075 --> 01:04:38.599]  We gave the Clintons chances, and we gave the Democrats chances, and all the traders chances.
[01:04:38.939 --> 01:04:39.940]  Chances are over.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:45.425]  And it doesn't matter what you do to Impor Wars, it's going to go forward.
[01:04:45.985 --> 01:04:46.446]  It's over.
[01:04:49.148 --> 01:04:49.669]  It's over.
[01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:53.172]  All Chinese agents are about to get arrested.
[01:04:53.992 --> 01:04:54.613]  Every one of you.
[01:04:56.001 --> 01:04:58.509]  Reportedly, that woman was carrying a database of their operatives.
[01:04:59.572 --> 01:05:00.455]  We already have the database.
[01:05:00.475 --> 01:05:01.458]  We want to have it from her.
[01:05:04.978 --> 01:05:05.639]  E.T.
[01:05:05.659 --> 01:05:06.339]  on in Texas.
[01:05:06.359 --> 01:05:06.800]  You're on the air.
[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:07.180]  Go ahead.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.321]  Yes, sir.
[01:05:08.381 --> 01:05:09.141]  How's it going?
[01:05:09.361 --> 01:05:09.762]  Greetings.
[01:05:10.102 --> 01:05:10.442]  Greetings.
[01:05:10.462 --> 01:05:10.843]  Welcome.
[01:05:10.863 --> 01:05:13.605]  America is for President Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:05:13.805 --> 01:05:14.445]  Anything else?
[01:05:14.565 --> 01:05:22.992]  Any other person, Hispanic, who wants to consider themselves an American or anything other than a real Jesus Christ believer is a fake and is a terrorist.
[01:05:23.052 --> 01:05:26.154]  So what I'm bringing out to you, brother, is may God bless you.
[01:05:26.254 --> 01:05:29.137]  The Infowars team, I appreciate all of your products.
[01:05:29.357 --> 01:05:29.837]  Accurate.
[01:05:29.957 --> 01:05:31.438]  I just received it on Monday, man.
[01:05:31.518 --> 01:05:32.279]  I see the results.
[01:05:32.459 --> 01:05:33.060]  It's beautiful.
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:33.580]  It's awesome.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.801]  I've been a long time listener.
[01:05:34.921 --> 01:05:38.382]  And I hope to hear from you again, and I will always keep in touch with you all.
[01:05:38.542 --> 01:05:39.762]  God bless you, Etian.
[01:05:39.942 --> 01:05:41.062]  I never plug Icarin.
[01:05:41.142 --> 01:05:44.743]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there, and to make it even stronger and better.
[01:05:44.763 --> 01:05:45.743]  What has the best ratings, name it.
[01:05:45.763 --> 01:05:49.184]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[01:05:49.224 --> 01:05:51.904]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician.
[01:05:51.924 --> 01:05:56.145]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler, because they're scared of real supplements.
[01:05:56.185 --> 01:06:01.126]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[01:06:01.146 --> 01:06:02.566]  So Icarin and InfoWareStore.com.
[01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:08.233]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:08.733 --> 01:06:13.859]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:18.797 --> 01:06:22.861]  Tonight, an unprecedented arrest escalating Trump's trade war to a whole new level.
[01:06:23.281 --> 01:06:26.644]  One of China's most important business leaders arrested in Canada.
[01:06:27.245 --> 01:06:31.649]  She is the CFO of tech giant Huawei, one of China's marquee companies.
[01:06:32.310 --> 01:06:34.031]  Huawei makes more cell phones than Apple.
[01:06:34.091 --> 01:06:36.334]  Revenues this year are set to top Boeing's.
[01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:46.282]  A source telling CNN the view among some officials is she could be used as leverage with China in trade talks and of course the expectation is she'll be extradited to the United States.
[01:06:46.782 --> 01:06:51.166]  Out front now, Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy.
[01:06:51.586 --> 01:06:54.328]  Okay Peter, this threw everything into disarray today.
[01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:55.609]  It shocked everybody.
[01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:57.311]  What is going on here?
[01:06:58.516 --> 01:06:59.116]  It's pretty simple.
[01:06:59.136 --> 01:07:00.757]  The two issues are totally separate.
[01:07:00.797 --> 01:07:04.519]  The trade negotiations and this arrest.
[01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:10.501]  The Justice Department acts on an independent track.
[01:07:10.841 --> 01:07:16.104]  The coincidence of the arrest happening in the same time frame was just that.
[01:07:16.944 --> 01:07:35.355]  And what we need to do on the negotiation side is just proceed from the dinner that we had in Argentina over the next 90 days to see if China can come to an accommodation with the bad behavior they engage in across a wide range of things.
[01:07:35.395 --> 01:07:39.457]  Meanwhile, the Justice Department will do what it needs to do.
[01:07:39.477 --> 01:07:42.359]  Can I just ask you a question on this?
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:48.701]  If that's really what happened, the Justice Department did it, are you saying they didn't tell the President, he had no idea?
[01:07:50.442 --> 01:07:56.163]  Yes, Erin, I was at the dinner with President Xi and President Trump.
[01:07:56.203 --> 01:07:58.543]  This was an amazing thing, two Presidents there.
[01:07:58.983 --> 01:08:05.205]  I was also an active participant in several meetings we had with the President leading up to that dinner.
[01:08:05.545 --> 01:08:09.966]  We had discussions with the team, Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, John Bolton,
[01:08:10.426 --> 01:08:13.989]  Secretary Pompeo, of course, Ambassador Lighthizer.
[01:08:14.530 --> 01:08:15.691]  This issue never came up.
[01:08:15.751 --> 01:08:21.835]  The president was unaware of it going into that dinner, as were all members of the team.
[01:08:22.016 --> 01:08:32.104]  And look, I think what's interesting to observe here is that the fact of the matter is, the reason why we're having such trouble with China is they do stuff like this all the time.
[01:08:32.704 --> 01:08:35.566]  They lie, they cheat, they steal, they force technology transfer.
[01:08:35.606 --> 01:08:37.348]  So on any given day,
[01:08:37.928 --> 01:08:41.612]  Uh, there have been actions taken against China over the course of this administration.
[01:08:41.632 --> 01:08:47.398]  Okay, but let me just ask you because... Okay, then she goes on to basically criticize the president inside of the Chai Coms as a traitor would.
[01:08:47.758 --> 01:08:48.299]  Let's explain.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:49.961]  There were...
[01:08:51.697 --> 01:08:58.701]  500 million plus people there when the leftist arm of the CIA in 1949 put Mao Zedong into power.
[01:08:58.721 --> 01:08:59.721]  This is all declassified now.
[01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:04.464]  I remember reading about it from the John Birch Society saying this in the 60s, but now it's all declassified.
[01:09:04.864 --> 01:09:12.447]  The John Birch Society got founded because they were aware of all this going on from John Birch who was an army officer who got tortured to death over there because he wouldn't go along with it.
[01:09:13.468 --> 01:09:19.211]  And so they used China as this base to commit criminal activity to move US jobs overseas
[01:09:21.243 --> 01:09:28.087]  And then work with the Chinese Communist Party that basically the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others set up.
[01:09:28.407 --> 01:09:31.609]  And David Rockefeller wrote New York Times op-eds admitting all this.
[01:09:31.949 --> 01:09:33.470]  He wrote books admitting it.
[01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:37.313]  You can just type in, David Rockefeller praises Mao Zedong.
[01:09:37.773 --> 01:09:41.575]  And then click images on Google and you'll get the New York Times articles.
[01:09:41.655 --> 01:09:44.177]  So, what I'm telling you is a fact.
[01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:49.952]  And now, again, 50 years ago, 99% of the country didn't have running water or toilets.
[01:09:50.552 --> 01:09:53.814]  Now they've got more cities, more systems than we do.
[01:09:55.535 --> 01:10:00.518]  Because the power was all transferred to them.
[01:10:01.599 --> 01:10:03.580]  Not the people of China, but the authoritarians.
[01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:11.185]  And now, you've got the second biggest cell phone telecom in the world, who plan to put in a nationwide 5G program.
[01:10:11.465 --> 01:10:12.846]  Obama was bringing it in with them.
[01:10:14.172 --> 01:10:14.792]  They're going to use U.S.
[01:10:14.812 --> 01:10:16.093]  taxpayer money to pay for part of it.
[01:10:16.153 --> 01:10:16.853]  Trump just killed it.
[01:10:17.833 --> 01:10:21.174]  And you've got Huawei, the second biggest cell phone company in the world.
[01:10:21.294 --> 01:10:22.195]  Apple's the third largest.
[01:10:23.735 --> 01:10:26.876]  And they moved to China and make up state-run.
[01:10:28.137 --> 01:10:33.999]  And so now they are coming out and saying, this is an act of war.
[01:10:34.859 --> 01:10:35.759]  We'll come after you.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.280]  We'll do all this to you.
[01:10:41.647 --> 01:10:46.509]  If you don't stop what you're doing, and the media is spinning it, oh they busted her because she was using U.S.
[01:10:46.569 --> 01:10:48.650]  money, violating U.S.
[01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:54.312]  law that she's agreed to, to give money to Iran to get around the sanctions.
[01:10:58.033 --> 01:10:58.854]  And that is part of it.
[01:11:02.898 --> 01:11:04.059]  Got her on that front.
[01:11:04.519 --> 01:11:08.042]  She's the number two person, largest, most successful company in China.
[01:11:08.703 --> 01:11:11.966]  This is China's biggest, most successful state-controlled company.
[01:11:12.506 --> 01:11:15.248]  Her father is in the top three or four people in the Communist Party.
[01:11:15.649 --> 01:11:20.073]  Some say he's more powerful than the dictator that Trump just met with.
[01:11:20.713 --> 01:11:23.235]  And so, yeah, it's more than a shot across the bow.
[01:11:23.295 --> 01:11:26.158]  It's like, you keep having your ships in the South China Sea,
[01:11:27.602 --> 01:11:30.182]  In waters that have never been disputed in the last five years.
[01:11:30.563 --> 01:11:31.463]  Shooting at our ships.
[01:11:32.043 --> 01:11:34.263]  You've got drones crashing into our ships.
[01:11:34.863 --> 01:11:36.264]  You're disappearing people.
[01:11:36.324 --> 01:11:38.064]  You're attacking U.S.
[01:11:38.124 --> 01:11:39.704]  embassies with microwave guns.
[01:11:40.724 --> 01:11:43.305]  You've been killing our assets in your country.
[01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:44.405]  We haven't been killing yours.
[01:11:44.985 --> 01:11:46.425]  And so now the gloves are off.
[01:11:47.165 --> 01:11:49.666]  Trump's not going to sit there and kill low-level people.
[01:11:50.826 --> 01:11:52.146]  He's not going to arrest low-level people.
[01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:55.387]  He's telling China, we just grabbed
[01:11:56.311 --> 01:12:15.735]  Your corrupt daughter who heads up your biggest company and we've got her computers and we're downloading everything off of them because I guarantee you they've been so arrogant thinking this country is a bunch of wimps that she's got all the material on her computer.
[01:12:16.015 --> 01:12:18.276]  Believe me, they wouldn't have grabbed her if they didn't already know it.
[01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:20.992]  They already scanned her computer remotely.
[01:12:21.012 --> 01:12:22.473]  They already knew full well what she had.
[01:12:22.913 --> 01:12:24.314]  They want the custody of it.
[01:12:24.354 --> 01:12:27.556]  They want the proof because let me tell you what she's got.
[01:12:28.957 --> 01:12:32.659]  She's got the Office of Personnel Management hack that Obama gave her.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.622]  And she's got everything else in there.
[01:12:36.682 --> 01:12:38.363]  She's got all those different codes.
[01:12:39.643 --> 01:12:44.907]  And she's over there with her other executives because they're not transferring that stuff over the internet.
[01:12:45.407 --> 01:12:46.368]  They are delivering it.
[01:12:47.168 --> 01:12:57.035]  Computer to computer and she's there setting up their military operations against America and their modern military operations are digital and they're financial.
[01:12:58.216 --> 01:13:03.399]  And they've got the chief of staff for Dianne Feinstein being a communist Chinese agent.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:08.303]  And half the other Democrats, you'll notice, will have a former Chinese nationalist.
[01:13:09.445 --> 01:13:13.567]  With intelligence ties as either their chief driver, assistant, or even chief of staff.
[01:13:14.267 --> 01:13:16.708]  Because that, the Chinese say, we own you.
[01:13:17.609 --> 01:13:19.109]  We will be in the Senate computers.
[01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:21.090]  You get our money through U.S.
[01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:21.791]  front companies.
[01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:24.392]  You and your husband, she's gotten over a billion from China.
[01:13:25.212 --> 01:13:26.713]  Her husband has, on record.
[01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:28.314]  Over a billion in U.S.
[01:13:28.334 --> 01:13:30.695]  taxpayer money as well in biotech her husband's gotten.
[01:13:30.715 --> 01:13:31.735]  She is a monster.
[01:13:32.476 --> 01:13:33.396]  Total enemy of this country.
[01:13:36.129 --> 01:13:38.031]  Under the Clintons and everybody, this just became normal.
[01:13:38.351 --> 01:13:39.952]  Clinton would have Chinese generals.
[01:13:39.992 --> 01:13:41.854]  Bill Clinton, you can pull this up on C-SPAN.
[01:13:42.154 --> 01:13:48.519]  Type in, uh, C-SPAN, uh, Chinese, uh, generals visit the White House.
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.382]  And they're in there with bags of briefcases.
[01:13:52.502 --> 01:13:54.664]  Each one had to carry a big double briefcase.
[01:13:54.984 --> 01:13:55.725]  You know, the big ones.
[01:13:58.047 --> 01:13:59.728]  In with $100 bills for Bill Clinton.
[01:14:02.190 --> 01:14:03.751]  He's like, this is absolutely fantastic.
[01:14:04.112 --> 01:14:05.192]  You want to have
[01:14:06.121 --> 01:14:19.288]  You want to have the separation system to get an ICBM into orbit properly, and you want the MIRV re-entry device technology, and let me get that straight again, you want from Laura Allen Hughes, you want the re-entry guidance systems.
[01:14:19.388 --> 01:14:24.510]  Listen, I can't give you past the 1980s, but how about I give you the MX missile plans?
[01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:25.591]  That sound good for you?
[01:14:27.286 --> 01:14:29.267]  Oh, you only want five million?
[01:14:30.167 --> 01:14:31.087]  Of course I'm a traitor.
[01:14:31.127 --> 01:14:31.827]  I hate this country.
[01:14:32.107 --> 01:14:32.587]  I was green.
[01:14:32.787 --> 01:14:34.168]  Listen, we helped set you guys up.
[01:14:34.248 --> 01:14:35.208]  We're giving everything to you.
[01:14:35.628 --> 01:14:36.708]  You think you're buying me off?
[01:14:36.808 --> 01:14:37.929]  It's part of the plan, brother.
[01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:39.569]  I'm going to be retiring over there.
[01:14:41.549 --> 01:14:43.230]  These are conversations in the room on record.
[01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:51.972]  They're like, oh, they cannot believe that they were actually given all the power and given all the industry and given all the jobs.
[01:14:54.352 --> 01:14:56.193]  But David Rockefeller and others set the deal up
[01:14:57.466 --> 01:15:05.110]  For the one-child policy, all of it, all China had to do was sell out America and sell out their own people and they would be given all the power and they have been.
[01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:13.694]  And now, think about it, Trump is coming in and just absolutely rolling it all up and that's why the Democrats are so scared.
[01:15:14.195 --> 01:15:15.535]  That's why they're all freaking out.
[01:15:15.996 --> 01:15:17.476]  That's why they don't know what to do.
[01:15:17.937 --> 01:15:19.457]  That's why they're crapping their britches.
[01:15:20.018 --> 01:15:24.060]  That's why it's getting so serious because they have committed such crimes.
[01:15:26.141 --> 01:15:26.862]  So they're all scared.
[01:15:26.882 --> 01:15:27.462]  Trump's coming in.
[01:15:27.482 --> 01:15:28.183]  He knows China.
[01:15:28.823 --> 01:15:30.424]  It's totally, you know, taking us over.
[01:15:30.785 --> 01:15:31.245]  What do we do?
[01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:32.206]  Well, we're foreign traders.
[01:15:32.246 --> 01:15:32.706]  We're globals.
[01:15:32.726 --> 01:15:33.427]  We hate America.
[01:15:34.647 --> 01:15:35.988]  Let's just say he's a Russian agent.
[01:15:38.370 --> 01:15:39.171]  The public will buy that?
[01:15:39.231 --> 01:15:39.631]  Won't matter.
[01:15:39.651 --> 01:15:40.972]  We'll just say that over and over again.
[01:15:43.654 --> 01:15:45.576]  And that's now what's really happening.
[01:15:45.596 --> 01:15:48.278]  Okay, I said I'd give it to Tucker Carlson, because he's come out.
[01:15:49.847 --> 01:15:52.529]  And he's taking Trump to the woodshed here.
[01:15:52.569 --> 01:15:55.011]  He said Trump hasn't kept any of his promises.
[01:15:55.432 --> 01:15:59.995]  I don't know what planet Tucker's living on, but about to take him to the woodshed.
[01:16:17.432 --> 01:16:26.516]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this limited run shirt that the crew had the idea to do because there's a popular saying on the internet, we're all Alex Jones.
[01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:28.016]  Don't censor me.
[01:16:28.476 --> 01:16:34.078]  And it's got the Gadsden coiled snake instead of don't tread on me or won't tread on me.
[01:16:34.198 --> 01:16:35.999]  It says, we're all Alex Jones.
[01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:37.400]  Don't censor me.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.942]  It's a very soft, nice fabric, black on white t-shirt.
[01:16:42.022 --> 01:16:46.865]  It is absolutely free at InfowarStore.com with any purchase.
[01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:53.749]  That means one tube of toothpaste, fluoride-free, colonel silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, or a water filtration system.
[01:16:53.769 --> 01:16:55.930]  Or you buy another t-shirt, you get this one free.
[01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:57.951]  And there's store-wide free shipping.
[01:16:58.351 --> 01:17:03.276]  And there's 50 to 75% off across the board on thousands of items.
[01:17:03.896 --> 01:17:07.039]  50% is the lowest special, 75% is the highest.
[01:17:07.119 --> 01:17:10.882]  We are selling all of our inventory out to go leaner and meaner into the new year.
[01:17:11.102 --> 01:17:17.108]  As you've seen, now Soros and the Globals are trying to shut down InfoWars, trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut us down.
[01:17:17.148 --> 01:17:25.335]  So this way you don't battle the crowds, you don't battle the traffic, you get hands down the best deals we've ever offered on best-selling items that would still probably sell out.
[01:17:25.435 --> 01:17:27.296]  Some of the stuff we've got by February or so.
[01:17:55.475 --> 01:17:55.855]  That's insane.
[01:17:56.376 --> 01:17:58.197]  And this free t-shirt.
[01:17:58.257 --> 01:18:01.719]  Now, they printed 5,000 of these up.
[01:18:02.359 --> 01:18:07.842]  So that means by the end of this week, because Christmas sales are always heavy, these shirts will be sold out.
[01:18:07.902 --> 01:18:09.563]  This is a limited edition.
[01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:10.984]  We're all Alex Jones.
[01:18:11.024 --> 01:18:11.945]  Don't censor me.
[01:18:11.985 --> 01:18:16.388]  And then it'll be a new shirt that will be the free gift that you get with it.
[01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:18.289]  It'll be another one of these great shirts we've got.
[01:18:18.749 --> 01:18:21.891]  They're all there at InfoWars4.com, so you cannot beat this deal.
[01:18:21.931 --> 01:18:27.255]  This is way above even the specials I've been running the last two months that have already been our biggest ever.
[01:18:27.396 --> 01:18:28.416]  So take advantage of it.
[01:18:28.496 --> 01:18:30.298]  Help us fund ourselves into next year.
[01:18:30.558 --> 01:18:32.259]  Try some of the great products you've never tried.
[01:18:32.399 --> 01:18:33.700]  Try Alphaphone.
[01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:35.141]  Try RainForce.
[01:18:35.382 --> 01:18:36.062]  Try X3.
[01:18:36.683 --> 01:18:42.667]  Try Super Male and Super Female Vitality, which is incredibly high-quality, cold-pressed herbs, five-star ratings.
[01:18:42.807 --> 01:18:43.948]  We've had it out for four years.
[01:18:43.968 --> 01:18:46.510]  I'm discontinuing because it's so expensive for us to make.
[01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:51.093]  It's so proprietary where we get it from Utah, one of the biggest firms out there, and I'm just done.
[01:18:51.253 --> 01:18:52.394]  That's it for Supermelt Vitality.
[01:18:52.414 --> 01:18:53.514]  Supermelt Vitality, it's amazing.
[01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:54.035]  We want it.
[01:18:54.055 --> 01:18:54.395]  It's there.
[01:18:54.535 --> 01:18:55.916]  Alpha Power is organic.
[01:18:55.936 --> 01:18:56.996]  It's a similar formula.
[01:18:57.056 --> 01:18:59.178]  It's even stronger, but it's not cold-pressed.
[01:18:59.218 --> 01:19:01.739]  So some people like Supermelt Vitality more.
[01:19:01.879 --> 01:19:05.902]  Alpha Power is amazing, and it costs a fraction of what Supermelt is.
[01:19:06.562 --> 01:19:11.327]  I do, but right now, they're 50% off, and there's just a bunch of other specials at mfullerstore.com.
[01:19:11.367 --> 01:19:15.972]  So I would just encourage you all to go to mfullerstore.com for the next 12 days.
[01:19:15.992 --> 01:19:18.955]  The unprecedented 12 days of Christmas sale launches today.
[01:19:18.975 --> 01:19:20.357]  75% off free shipping.

[01:19:24.982 --> 01:19:26.083]  You cannot beat the deal.
[01:19:26.203 --> 01:19:27.985]  mfullerstore.com or mfullershop.com.
[01:19:28.345 --> 01:19:30.266]  Makes you right to the supplement page.
[01:19:30.506 --> 01:19:33.087]  Please promote our local radio affiliates.
[01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:40.730]  It is so vital that if you're listening to us in California or Texas or New York, however you're listening, remember, you're the only person that can get past the censors.
[01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:48.273]  So tell people about that local radio station, about that local TV station, and tell folks about their local URL as well.
[01:19:48.833 --> 01:19:50.434]  Word of mouth is king in this fight.
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:09.042]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.967 --> 01:20:16.809]  I won't be there anymore.
[01:20:16.869 --> 01:20:20.872]  Get out of my way.
[01:20:21.332 --> 01:20:22.853]  Let me by.
[01:20:23.174 --> 01:20:26.296]  I got better things to do with my time.
[01:20:26.596 --> 01:20:28.338]  I don't care anymore.
[01:20:30.039 --> 01:20:31.741]  I don't care anymore.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:55.814]  So, it's been argued that things like the Vatican, things like Israel, get set up by religions or organizations or groups so that people can commit crimes in one country or one area and then run back to those areas.
[01:20:56.915 --> 01:21:05.843]  Well, with the case of communist China, corrupt globalists in our country, the Rockefellers and others on record, helped set up modern communist China, put Mao into power,
[01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:21.447]  So that they could have a place with no human rights, no industrial cleanliness, no regulations, to go in and take a group of smart, hard-working people, industrialize them, and then use them to take over the planet.
[01:21:24.069 --> 01:21:24.869]  And that's now been done.
[01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.372]  And it's been done by selling out our nation.
[01:21:28.973 --> 01:21:31.594]  And I've just spent most of the show on this, because it's such a big deal.
[01:21:32.441 --> 01:21:48.229]  That Trump has arrested the number two executive at China's biggest company, this telecom giant with 5G, second biggest smartphone maker, who's been banned from Australia to India, from Japan to the United States on U.S.
[01:21:48.249 --> 01:21:50.971]  military bases, but many countries ban it, period!
[01:21:53.223 --> 01:21:55.626]  Because they've been caught putting spy chips on them.
[01:21:55.646 --> 01:21:57.928]  Remember the big Bloomberg investigative report a couple months ago?
[01:21:58.389 --> 01:22:01.412]  You heard about it years ago, but we're next year's news today.
[01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:10.823]  Little chips that then grab your wireless code, everything, and then back-channel, dial in like a modem, back to Chi-Com headquarters with all your personal data.
[01:22:12.044 --> 01:22:12.785]  Here's the big issue.
[01:22:13.025 --> 01:22:13.506]  I haven't hit yet.
[01:22:15.765 --> 01:22:28.727]  If Apple moved there earlier this year to be tax-exempt and gave their Apple code keys to the government and admitted, well, that's part of being state-run here to be tax-exempt, then they're a bigger threat than Huawei.
[01:22:29.427 --> 01:22:35.808]  And that's what scared Tim Cook so much four months ago when he called for me to be banned and all the other CEOs got in line.
[01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:45.090]  But see, Tim, we're still on hundreds of AM and FM stations and hundreds of TV stations and still have Infowars.com and Newswars.com, but something even more important
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:55.487]  We have this great audience of men and women and young people, black, white, old, young, Asian, Christian, Falun Gong, Buddhists that are upset.
[01:22:55.668 --> 01:22:58.430]  They're huge supporters because they've been imprisoned and killed.
[01:22:58.710 --> 01:22:59.331]  Their families have.
[01:22:59.751 --> 01:23:02.993]  Supporting Infowars by something called people power.
[01:23:03.454 --> 01:23:04.114]  Word of mouth.
[01:23:06.036 --> 01:23:06.877]  And they're taking action.
[01:23:07.137 --> 01:23:15.684]  So I wanted to just recap that because this is so epic and China's calling it an act of war and there could be huge repercussions, but at some point, we've got to stop letting them push
[01:23:18.092 --> 01:23:18.532]  And push.
[01:23:20.594 --> 01:23:21.094]  And push.
[01:23:23.837 --> 01:23:24.277]  And push.
[01:23:26.078 --> 01:23:26.418]  And push.
[01:23:26.439 --> 01:23:27.139]  That's what's happening now.
[01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:28.360]  It's called pushback.
[01:23:29.901 --> 01:23:31.182]  And I wanted to hit that first.
[01:23:31.242 --> 01:23:33.504]  It's one of Trump's biggest accomplishments.
[01:23:33.644 --> 01:23:39.348]  He said, I'll stand up to China doing one-sided trade deals where they have multi-hundred percent tariffs on us.
[01:23:40.339 --> 01:23:41.520]  And we have no tariff on them.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:45.303]  They do it through taxes, they do it through currency, they do it through actual tariffs.
[01:23:45.703 --> 01:23:46.643]  He said, you know, Canada?
[01:23:47.284 --> 01:23:50.726]  It's got a 280% tariff on dairy, just to name one of many.
[01:23:51.507 --> 01:23:52.348]  We'll just do that to them.
[01:23:53.789 --> 01:23:54.369]  And Trump did it!
[01:23:56.971 --> 01:24:00.974]  And suddenly thousands of factories came back, because now we were open for business again.
[01:24:02.054 --> 01:24:04.116]  So the private Federal Reserve came in and tried to block all that.
[01:24:04.596 --> 01:24:07.418]  And then in comes Tucker Carlson, one of the smartest people out there.
[01:24:07.438 --> 01:24:09.540]  Definitely the smartest on cable news.
[01:24:10.762 --> 01:24:17.448]  And he does this big interview with the German newspaper Die Weltwoche, if I'm saying it right.
[01:24:18.209 --> 01:24:21.192]  Tucker, Trump hasn't kept any of his chief promises.
[01:24:21.873 --> 01:24:25.056]  This horrendous system wasn't created overnight, and it can't be fixed overnight.
[01:24:25.096 --> 01:24:35.146]  So I think what he's saying is, in a backhanded support, as I read the article, you're not going to be able to defeat this overnight.
[01:24:36.294 --> 01:24:37.675]  But Trump's from the outsides.
[01:24:37.715 --> 01:24:39.056]  He doesn't even know how to deal with it.
[01:24:39.176 --> 01:24:39.977]  That's actually a good thing.
[01:24:40.037 --> 01:24:45.742]  But where Tucker's really wrong is he says Trump hasn't gotten anything done.
[01:24:45.782 --> 01:24:46.403]  He said he would.
[01:24:46.923 --> 01:24:53.128]  And he lists defund Planned Parenthood, repeal Obamacare, and build a wall.
[01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:57.752]  Now those are things that Trump said that he would support.
[01:24:58.633 --> 01:24:59.974]  But the Republicans are wimps.
[01:25:00.074 --> 01:25:00.815]  They're sold out.
[01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:01.476]  They're cowards.
[01:25:02.369 --> 01:25:04.750]  So a bunch of them, 40 plus, have stepped down.
[01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:06.891]  We're getting some Freedom Caucus folks in.
[01:25:07.171 --> 01:25:09.492]  They get attacked with guns and people try to kill them.
[01:25:11.153 --> 01:25:12.173]  But we're moving forward!
[01:25:13.073 --> 01:25:18.496]  But I get trying to put heat on the President to do more, but the President's already done so much.
[01:25:18.516 --> 01:25:20.176]  But let's talk about what the President's actually done.
[01:25:21.237 --> 01:25:27.339]  Where he has the executive power to do it, he said he'd pull out of the TPP that was written to totally sell out the U.S.
[01:25:27.399 --> 01:25:28.240]  and transfer our power.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:28.960]  He did it.
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:31.101]  He said he would appoint conservative
[01:25:32.099 --> 01:25:33.380]  Judges in the Supreme Court.
[01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:34.460]  Wow, two of them!
[01:25:35.281 --> 01:25:36.021]  In the first two years.
[01:25:36.741 --> 01:25:37.742]  And fought like hell to do it.
[01:25:40.103 --> 01:25:53.110]  He also made populism and nationalism good again, and gave us faith in ourselves, or at least said it was okay to like America, and to love the flag, and to believe in what our country stood for.
[01:25:54.270 --> 01:26:00.994]  And then he got trillions in the stock market, and over a trillion dollars in new jobs, and the fastest growing
[01:26:03.567 --> 01:26:08.609]  Blue collar and middle class paychecks.
[01:26:10.289 --> 01:26:13.731]  You know, there's an article by Washington Examiner, that's one of the shorter lists.
[01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:16.792]  It's only, let me read the headline here.
[01:26:17.512 --> 01:26:21.093]  It's only 289 accomplishments.
[01:26:22.193 --> 01:26:27.515]  Because when I'm reading this, which I've read the whole thing again today, it gives me a headache because my brain starts working overtime.
[01:26:28.476 --> 01:26:29.316]  It's way more than this.
[01:26:31.957 --> 01:26:43.243]  But you go through it, everything he had executive power over, he's done or tried to do, and then his own people brag, oh well we just ignore it when he says he's going to sign an executive order, we just throw it away.
[01:26:43.263 --> 01:26:45.244]  He's talking about treason.
[01:26:47.685 --> 01:26:50.166]  So economic growth, never said it would hit 3%, went way above 4.2.
[01:26:50.207 --> 01:26:52.188]  Federal Reserve came in to block it.
[01:26:53.408 --> 01:26:54.689]  And there's a huge list of those.
[01:26:56.328 --> 01:26:57.589]  VA waits got cut.
[01:26:58.050 --> 01:26:59.411]  Veteran unemployment got cut.
[01:26:59.491 --> 01:27:00.452]  Black unemployment lowest level.
[01:27:00.492 --> 01:27:01.213]  It just goes on and on.
[01:27:01.693 --> 01:27:03.014]  American optimism went way up.
[01:27:03.074 --> 01:27:04.456]  American income went way up.
[01:27:04.936 --> 01:27:06.898]  Deregulation written by globalists.
[01:27:07.018 --> 01:27:08.399]  UN regulations all got cut.
[01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:10.661]  Small businesses record growth.
[01:27:11.162 --> 01:27:11.782]  Tax cuts.
[01:27:12.583 --> 01:27:13.584]  For the poor and middle class.
[01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:15.665]  Let me tell you, they see me as wealthy, my taxes went up.
[01:27:15.965 --> 01:27:16.606]  I didn't bitch about it.
[01:27:16.966 --> 01:27:21.429]  He got rid of the property tax write-off, because the blue states all do that as a scam to not pay taxes.
[01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:23.010]  Trump blew it all away.
[01:27:23.050 --> 01:27:23.691]  That's why.
[01:27:24.351 --> 01:27:27.993]  He actually, like JFK, he raised taxes on rich people, cut it on poor people.
[01:27:28.354 --> 01:27:31.276]  So we're really dealing here with a JFK type.
[01:27:33.457 --> 01:27:37.580]  All these different worker development programs, all the giant infrastructure preparement, healthcare.
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.222]  He can't get rid of all of Obamacare, but he got rid of the mandate.
[01:27:40.953 --> 01:27:42.916]  Domestic infrastructure, 1.5 trillion.
[01:27:43.697 --> 01:27:44.819]  Combating opioids.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:50.607]  Telling China, you execute people shipping opioids into your country, how about you execute yourself shipping in here?
[01:27:50.808 --> 01:27:52.530]  They're the biggest importer as a weapon.
[01:27:52.871 --> 01:27:53.532]  Law and order.
[01:27:54.032 --> 01:27:54.834]  All the things he's done there.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.984]  And he said decriminalize medical marijuana, which he said he would do.
[01:28:01.244 --> 01:28:03.326]  Border security, they'll never pass it.
[01:28:03.346 --> 01:28:04.548]  Republicans won't, Democrats won't.
[01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:11.054]  So he put the military down there, and it's the lowest level of illegal aliens in the last 30 years in the United States, in latest numbers.
[01:28:13.877 --> 01:28:16.518]  On trade, again, he's standing up for us getting better deals.
[01:28:16.538 --> 01:28:17.138]  Who can deny that?
[01:28:17.678 --> 01:28:19.379]  That's why the globalists are all pissed off.
[01:28:19.799 --> 01:28:23.621]  And the, oh, energy, turning the coal back on, which drives down our power prices.
[01:28:24.521 --> 01:28:28.283]  Foreign policy, bringing back sovereignty to the U.S., doing what he said he'd do, moving the U.S.
[01:28:28.323 --> 01:28:29.363]  Embassy to Jerusalem.
[01:28:29.863 --> 01:28:31.124]  Veterans Affairs, it goes on and on.
[01:28:31.464 --> 01:28:33.945]  So the idea, we're going to come back and talk about this because I see Scott.
[01:28:34.685 --> 01:28:36.406]  Scott Bronson, let's show a shot of him for TV viewers.
[01:28:37.066 --> 01:28:39.307]  Scott Bronson, one of our Affiliate Relations guys, just popped up.
[01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:39.987]  He wants to talk.
[01:28:40.687 --> 01:28:41.448]  Can we cut to him for a minute?
[01:28:42.128 --> 01:28:43.789]  Scott Bronson wants to say something about this.
[01:28:43.809 --> 01:28:46.890]  I'm not sure what he wants to say, but this has got him hot under the collar.
[01:28:47.290 --> 01:28:48.831]  He's gonna pop in on this on the other side.
[01:28:48.891 --> 01:28:50.912]  So, is Tucker Carlson right?
[01:28:51.412 --> 01:28:59.115]  Well, we'll look at what Tucker Carlson said, then we'll look at what's actually going on here in a moment and ask, why did Tucker not give in to BS say these things?
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:05.181]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:29:05.601 --> 01:29:11.843]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:29:12.203 --> 01:29:16.164]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:29:16.664 --> 01:29:29.128]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra-purified krill oil, and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:29:29.648 --> 01:29:41.153]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:29:41.633 --> 01:29:50.877]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:29:51.457 --> 01:29:55.239]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:29:55.799 --> 01:30:00.501]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:02.942 --> 01:30:12.666]  We're here because you've stood with us.
[01:30:16.079 --> 01:30:17.900]  And it's been amazing.
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:21.141]  And because of what you've done as an audience, we've changed the world.
[01:30:21.261 --> 01:30:26.203]  We fundamentally expose globalism as this planetary, world government, authoritarian system.
[01:30:26.363 --> 01:30:27.524]  And so they denied it existed.
[01:30:27.604 --> 01:30:32.326]  But now they're out in the open admitting it exists because they were unsuccessful in stopping a debate about it.
[01:30:32.386 --> 01:30:39.513]  So now they've just moved directly to total censorship of any nationalist, of any Christian, of any conservative that exposes the scam that they're involved in.
[01:30:39.553 --> 01:30:50.063]  And there's a clip on DrudgeReport.com where Alexander Cortez says it's inevitable that global warming governance, a global governance of global warming, tracking everything you do, will create economic, social, and
[01:30:51.664 --> 01:31:02.611]  We can use the transition to 100% renewable energy as the vehicle to truly deliver and establish economic, social, and racial justice in the United States of America.
[01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:07.094]  That is our proposal, and that is what we are here to do.
[01:31:07.534 --> 01:31:12.736]  So that's these big carbon exchanges owned by Al Gore and Laura Rothschild and Barack Obama.
[01:31:12.776 --> 01:31:14.017]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:31:14.057 --> 01:31:17.358]  Being paid by everybody that engages in any human activity.
[01:31:17.539 --> 01:31:18.239]  Everything's taxed.
[01:31:18.399 --> 01:31:18.659]  Everything.
[01:31:18.779 --> 01:31:19.760]  Being born is taxed.
[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:29.344]  And you pay this new superclass of Bernie Sanders types to fly around in their private jets while they tell you they're saving the earth and saving the atmosphere with all these taxes.
[01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:37.048]  While they're carrying out geoengineering operations that actually could collapse the atmosphere, all the scientists that have looked at it say.
[01:31:37.208 --> 01:31:38.509]  So, they're collapsing it.
[01:31:38.609 --> 01:31:42.591]  They're gonna bring the taxes in and then later say, oh, we acted too little too late.
[01:31:42.791 --> 01:31:44.632]  You can see the whole diabolical plan.
[01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:47.914]  Mike Adams has written a masterstroke report that everyone should read.
[01:31:48.054 --> 01:31:50.295]  It's at naturalnews.com and infowars.com.
[01:31:50.415 --> 01:31:51.996]  Terraforming has begun.
[01:31:52.016 --> 01:31:56.118]  Global dimming is a plot to exterminate humanity by terraforming the atmosphere.
[01:31:56.198 --> 01:31:57.079]  We're good to go.
[01:32:20.615 --> 01:32:25.839]  And double Patriot points, meaning after your order, it goes in your little account where you get five, usually.
[01:32:25.919 --> 01:32:30.622]  Now you get 10 points or 10 cents off each dollar on your next purchase.
[01:32:30.842 --> 01:32:31.423]  It's a big deal.

[01:32:42.291 --> 01:32:42.991]  I know you know that.
[01:32:43.011 --> 01:32:46.834]  So I also wanted to thank you all for your support in making the InfoWare
[01:32:46.994 --> 01:32:51.118]  Possible the 12 days of Christmas are running through right up until the 19th.
[01:32:51.498 --> 01:33:08.934]  Please take advantage of it without you will be shut down You're listening to the Alex Jones Show
[01:33:20.765 --> 01:33:26.851]  For humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:33:26.951 --> 01:33:29.233]  You better believe you've got one!
[01:33:31.375 --> 01:33:36.620]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:49.645 --> 01:33:59.208]  So if you just joined us, Tucker Carlson has come out in a big German magazine interview, and the headline is, Trump hasn't kept any of his chief promises.
[01:34:01.208 --> 01:34:02.289]  Now, I'm not in a cult.
[01:34:02.349 --> 01:34:03.249]  I'm not in the Trump cult.
[01:34:03.489 --> 01:34:05.429]  So, Tucker Carlson's a smart guy, and I respect what he's doing.
[01:34:05.449 --> 01:34:06.670]  In fact, I know what he's doing.
[01:34:07.410 --> 01:34:09.851]  He's trying to point out that a lot of key things haven't been done.
[01:34:09.911 --> 01:34:18.053]  A lot of fire under the president, a lot of fire under the general public, and to point out that, as he says, this horrendous system wasn't created overnight.
[01:34:19.488 --> 01:34:20.474]  And it can't be fixed.
[01:34:21.238 --> 01:34:21.399]  Over.
[01:34:24.923 --> 01:34:31.507]  But then he goes on to say his chief promises were that he would build the wall, defund Planned Parenthood, and repeal Obamacare.
[01:34:32.028 --> 01:34:33.448]  And he hasn't done any of those things.
[01:34:33.549 --> 01:34:34.729]  And there's lots of reasons for that.
[01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:42.915]  But since I finished writing the book, I've come to believe that Trump's role is not as a conventional president who promises to get things achieved to Congress than it does.
[01:34:43.395 --> 01:34:44.676]  I don't think that he's capable.
[01:34:45.176 --> 01:34:47.297]  I don't think he's capable of sustained focus.
[01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:49.519]  I don't think he understands the system.
[01:34:49.979 --> 01:34:51.500]  I don't think Congress is on his side.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.002]  I don't think he and his own agenda support him.
[01:34:54.807 --> 01:34:55.768]  He's not going to do that.
[01:34:57.229 --> 01:35:00.931]  Well, gosh almighty, we got a record economy turnaround.
[01:35:01.352 --> 01:35:02.332]  TPP killed.
[01:35:02.612 --> 01:35:05.114]  He's standing up to the Chai comms, getting way better trade deals.
[01:35:06.855 --> 01:35:08.957]  And all these other positive things are happening.
[01:35:10.718 --> 01:35:14.040]  It's because Trump is an outsider and never ran for office that he's so different.
[01:35:14.421 --> 01:35:15.822]  He said he did fire all the lobbyists.
[01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:18.544]  That's what threatens the system so much.
[01:35:21.001 --> 01:35:27.205]  I think if you look at two Supreme Court justices that are pretty conservative compared to what Hillary would do, light years better.
[01:35:27.265 --> 01:35:27.966]  That's a big victory.
[01:35:28.286 --> 01:35:29.066]  He said he would do that.
[01:35:29.386 --> 01:35:30.627]  He said that was a main pillar.
[01:35:31.308 --> 01:35:33.069]  He said a main pillar was securing our border.
[01:35:33.369 --> 01:35:36.051]  And he wanted a wall as an image.
[01:35:36.131 --> 01:35:40.354]  But we've got the military down there and it's record low number of illegal aliens in the country.
[01:35:41.775 --> 01:35:42.755]  That's a national study.
[01:35:45.097 --> 01:35:46.958]  He's got parts of Obamacare chopped up.
[01:35:46.998 --> 01:35:49.720]  He can do executively the mandate and things like that.
[01:35:50.913 --> 01:35:51.954]  But he's not a dictator.
[01:35:53.355 --> 01:35:55.276]  So I just don't think it's fair to do this.
[01:35:55.296 --> 01:35:57.658]  And it's kind of like Ann Coulter.
[01:35:57.698 --> 01:36:03.642]  You know, she's always got these flamboyant headlines about Trump's a traitor, he's the last Republican president.
[01:36:04.082 --> 01:36:08.846]  And sure, it gets people to read what you're writing, but I'm always getting accused of putting up flamboyant headlines to get readers.
[01:36:08.886 --> 01:36:10.467]  No, I put up a headline I think's accurate.
[01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:16.812]  Now, he goes on to admit that Trump does ask the right questions.
[01:36:16.932 --> 01:36:19.053]  That Democrats don't care about working people.
[01:36:19.073 --> 01:36:19.754]  In fact, they hate them.
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:23.725]  And that they are robbing people, that they're corrupt, and they're bad.
[01:36:23.765 --> 01:36:25.609]  Well, yeah, Trump's fighting the carbon tax.
[01:36:26.070 --> 01:36:26.792]  He pulled out of that.
[01:36:26.832 --> 01:36:30.540]  I mean, there's so many things Trump has done that I just don't think is fair.
[01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:44.952]  To say that, what you should really say is Trump's got an incredible amount of things done despite the gridlock in Congress, despite the cowardice of the Republican Party, despite the fact the public is still generally asleep.
[01:36:45.513 --> 01:36:47.135]  I mean, how is he supposed to do everything?
[01:36:47.175 --> 01:36:51.740]  If you just blame Trump, it's like you don't have arms or legs or a brain or a mouth.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.782]  You're just saying he didn't do it.
[01:36:55.595 --> 01:36:58.077]  He didn't come from nowhere and go under all the attack and beat Hillary.
[01:36:58.377 --> 01:37:03.882]  He didn't lose $2 billion out of his fortune since he ran and since they boycotted him.
[01:37:03.962 --> 01:37:05.423]  He isn't under criminal investigation.
[01:37:05.463 --> 01:37:06.364]  He isn't being harassed.
[01:37:06.624 --> 01:37:07.865]  His family isn't harassed.
[01:37:07.945 --> 01:37:10.167]  It's like, what have you done for me lately?
[01:37:11.388 --> 01:37:16.772]  It's this hyper-decadent, instant gratification culture.
[01:37:18.774 --> 01:37:19.714]  I go to Congress.
[01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:21.674]  To go see what's happening.
[01:37:21.714 --> 01:37:24.635]  And there's no constituents at House members' doorways.
[01:37:24.895 --> 01:37:26.176]  There's nobody talking to Senators.
[01:37:26.956 --> 01:37:28.457]  Oh, they're Senators like some God.
[01:37:28.797 --> 01:37:34.539]  Oh, there's... We sent our reporters to the border to show tens of thousands of illegal aliens trying to come across UN-funded.
[01:37:35.099 --> 01:37:36.440]  It's our reporters and nobody else.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.620]  Fox News is maybe a mile away.
[01:37:39.421 --> 01:37:42.902]  And I'm not bitching, but I'm saying, take a family vacation.
[01:37:43.142 --> 01:37:44.502]  Let the kids go to San Diego.
[01:37:45.103 --> 01:37:46.883]  You go down and videotape what's happening on the border.
[01:37:47.223 --> 01:37:48.704]  You might catch something nobody else does.
[01:37:50.029 --> 01:37:52.912]  And just get in the act of putting it on YouTube or Twitter or Facebook.
[01:37:53.152 --> 01:37:54.934]  Get in the act of starting your own local news site.
[01:37:56.635 --> 01:37:58.457]  What does BuzzFeed and George Soros want?
[01:37:58.477 --> 01:38:01.159]  They want local news reporting itself shut down.
[01:38:01.219 --> 01:38:09.107]  They're blaming the yellow emergency jacket movement that's spread all over Europe on the fact that locals can communicate.
[01:38:09.187 --> 01:38:09.567]  Period.
[01:38:11.569 --> 01:38:13.350]  If you want to talk about where President Trump's failed.
[01:38:14.447 --> 01:38:17.689]  In picking what he wants to focus on.
[01:38:18.030 --> 01:38:23.813]  He's done a great job trying to turn the economy on, thinking that people would see that they've been under bad management and that he was for them.
[01:38:24.994 --> 01:38:26.655]  Part of that they saw, part of it they didn't.
[01:38:28.276 --> 01:38:33.500]  He gets standing up to China, who's absolutely dominating and taking over because they bought off our government.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.481]  He sees that as central.
[01:38:34.521 --> 01:38:34.901]  He's right.
[01:38:35.221 --> 01:38:40.785]  And boy, they just arrested the head of the biggest Chinese state-run company, basically for espionage against this nation.
[01:38:42.406 --> 01:38:43.947]  And our own corporate media is against him for that.
[01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:52.693]  If you want to talk about where he's failed, he promised to appoint a commission to expose vaccines and all the damage they're causing and the autoimmune responses.
[01:38:52.713 --> 01:38:54.454]  He would do it to his own son, Barron.
[01:38:54.494 --> 01:38:55.034]  He didn't do it.
[01:38:56.535 --> 01:39:09.320]  And he has not, he's spoken about it, but he's not done enough yet on antitrust and lying to Congress about big tech, about censorship of nationalists, Christians, conservatives, and patriot supporters.
[01:39:13.228 --> 01:39:18.890]  He said he'd get out of Afghanistan, and then now they understand it's about blocking China moving into Afghanistan, so we have him.
[01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:20.130]  He failed us on that.
[01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:35.535]  I follow all the real issues, but compared to a Hillary Clinton, it's night and day, and Trump's trying as hard as he can to deliver on what he said he would do, and so this process of getting pissed off and thinking he's betrayed us, it's not accurate.
[01:39:36.035 --> 01:39:38.236]  He will gain you brownie points with the mainstream media.
[01:39:39.482 --> 01:39:46.185]  And then they'll go read Tucker Carlson's full interview where he actually indicts the Democrats for hating America and hating the middle class and creating the crisis.
[01:39:46.925 --> 01:39:51.147]  I get why Carlson did it was to make himself look non-biased.
[01:39:53.468 --> 01:39:59.031]  But I think overall it was probably quoted out of context as well and just goes too far over the other side.
[01:39:59.631 --> 01:40:00.892]  But that isn't really what matters.
[01:40:01.572 --> 01:40:03.673]  It's about us looking in the mirror and asking what we've done.
[01:40:05.663 --> 01:40:24.294]  To restore this republic, to restore our own futures, to stand up, to be involved, and it's about recognizing that the Democrats are totally gone, the Republicans are a bunch of blue-blood scum, and we've begun the process with the Freedom Caucus and others of getting real Republicans elected that will vote with the President, and that's happening!
[01:40:26.431 --> 01:40:28.292]  That's what the Democrats have had to resort to fraud.
[01:40:28.712 --> 01:40:35.357]  Now I know one of our Affiliate Relations guys who does a great job, Scott Bronson, wanted to pop in and give his take on this.
[01:40:35.377 --> 01:40:39.039]  I don't know what his take is yet exactly, but he's always making good points to me in the hallways.
[01:40:39.459 --> 01:40:41.240]  Scott, you wanted to come on here and talk about this.
[01:40:41.460 --> 01:40:42.021]  Give us your take.
[01:40:42.601 --> 01:40:43.261]  Uh, yeah.
[01:40:43.561 --> 01:40:48.943]  I believe that Tucker has just put the blame on the wrong party.
[01:40:50.063 --> 01:40:51.264]  I think it's the Republicans.
[01:40:51.444 --> 01:40:52.884]  The Republicans are to blame for this.
[01:40:53.244 --> 01:40:53.905]  It's not Trump.
[01:40:54.025 --> 01:40:55.285]  The Republicans are losers.
[01:40:55.685 --> 01:40:56.665]  They are losers.
[01:40:57.286 --> 01:40:58.346]  And losers lose.
[01:40:58.746 --> 01:41:01.047]  They controlled the House, the Senate,
[01:41:01.707 --> 01:41:07.470]  And the executive branch, they could have did whatever they want, and they sat and they went for the tool of the loser.
[01:41:08.010 --> 01:41:08.731]  Compromise.
[01:41:09.351 --> 01:41:10.792]  I want to compromise.
[01:41:10.852 --> 01:41:12.233]  We need to come up with a deal.
[01:41:12.613 --> 01:41:16.115]  There is no deal that can be made if you think you are right.
[01:41:16.535 --> 01:41:22.358]  You either believe in the Second Amendment, and people can own guns and all the stuff that comes with that, or you don't.
[01:41:22.858 --> 01:41:28.241]  You either believe in free speech and people are allowed to say everything that they want, or you don't.
[01:41:28.702 --> 01:41:30.763]  There's no compromise on those things.
[01:41:31.483 --> 01:41:37.528]  You either believe that you need to defund Planned Parenthood and you take the steps to do that, or you don't.
[01:41:38.029 --> 01:41:42.472]  And it's not Trump that hasn't done that, it's our elected Republicans.
[01:41:42.512 --> 01:41:48.818]  That's right, he went and marched repeatedly in Sudden Pants with the pro-life demonstrations, something Reagan wouldn't even do.
[01:41:48.918 --> 01:41:52.961]  Exactly, he's done, he has attempted everything he said he would do and gotten so much done.
[01:41:53.302 --> 01:41:55.524]  That's why, I don't want to say it's obscene as I respect her, Harrelson,
[01:41:56.164 --> 01:42:01.407]  But, I mean, it really is to sit back and say that he's done none of his main tenets.
[01:42:02.088 --> 01:42:03.128]  What about TPP?
[01:42:03.229 --> 01:42:04.489]  What about trying to defend the border?
[01:42:04.830 --> 01:42:06.791]  What about getting good Supreme Court justice put in?
[01:42:07.171 --> 01:42:08.512]  What about getting jobs to come back?
[01:42:08.552 --> 01:42:10.173]  What about turning the economy back on?
[01:42:10.213 --> 01:42:14.015]  He's done it all, and now he's being counter-offensed by the Federal Reserve.
[01:42:14.075 --> 01:42:16.237]  Why didn't Tucker Carlson talk about the Federal Reserve?
[01:42:16.257 --> 01:42:17.338]  And I'm not telling Tucker what to do.
[01:42:17.378 --> 01:42:18.198]  I'm not even mad at Tucker.
[01:42:18.518 --> 01:42:19.219]  It's good for debate.
[01:42:19.559 --> 01:42:21.000]  I think Tucker just wants to spur debate.
[01:42:22.915 --> 01:42:26.037]  I don't know what he wants to do, but I think he's putting the blame at the wrong people.
[01:42:26.297 --> 01:42:28.819]  There's two types of people out there now.
[01:42:28.879 --> 01:42:31.261]  You have the Republicans, and then the Republicans.
[01:42:31.601 --> 01:42:34.903]  The Republicans keep telling us, oh, we can't repeal Obamacare.
[01:42:35.243 --> 01:42:36.944]  So then Trump took the step that he could.
[01:42:37.124 --> 01:42:43.529]  He took away the single payer, the part where we have to pay if we don't have... Mandate.
[01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:44.309]  Yeah, the mandate.
[01:42:45.770 --> 01:42:46.591]  So he took that away.
[01:42:46.751 --> 01:42:47.591]  That's what he could do.
[01:42:48.332 --> 01:42:49.993]  It's on them to make the laws.
[01:42:50.593 --> 01:42:52.315]  It's not the President's job to make laws.
[01:42:53.075 --> 01:42:55.760]  Well, Tucker makes that point that, well, he hid them from the swamp and didn't know how to deal with it.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:42:56.983]  Well, that's the least he's gotten anything done.
[01:42:57.584 --> 01:43:01.030]  Because you're right, the whole swamp is a bunch of glad-handing fake lawyers.
[01:43:02.771 --> 01:43:16.602]  Six months ago, M4 Wars Life came out with a reformulated, even stronger, even better bone broth formulation called Ultimate Bone Broth, and it is the strongest, purest, most high-quality bone broth system out there on the market.
[01:43:16.642 --> 01:43:26.330]  We made sure it was the best, and it's filled with chaga mushroom, it's filled with bee pollen, high-quality turmeric for your joints, for your body, for your muscles, for your bones.
[01:43:26.670 --> 01:43:27.311]  This is
[01:43:27.811 --> 01:43:28.832]  The ultimate superfood.
[01:43:29.152 --> 01:43:34.257]  There's tons of research on basic bone broth, particularly from chicken bones, and that's what this has in it.
[01:43:34.577 --> 01:43:40.462]  But this is concentrated, so it's way, way, way, way stronger than grandma's chicken noodle soup.
[01:43:40.482 --> 01:43:45.426]  You put the other superfoods in there, it's something you simply have to experience yourself.
[01:43:45.546 --> 01:43:46.467]  It is phenomenal.
[01:43:46.727 --> 01:43:53.531]  You need to go to InfoWarsLife.com and read the third-party reviews yourself to see what people are experiencing.
[01:43:53.731 --> 01:43:56.953]  So, we had the new formulation come in about six months ago.
[01:43:57.053 --> 01:43:58.274]  It sold out very, very quickly.
[01:43:59.975 --> 01:44:01.596]  So I put in a huge order.
[01:44:02.612 --> 01:44:06.796]  And we still have 3,000 or 4,000 canisters of this left.
[01:44:07.256 --> 01:44:13.762]  And before the end of the year, so we don't have to pay inventory tax, this is another one of the great items we're offering at cost.
[01:44:14.822 --> 01:44:16.164]  It's 50% off right now, $19.95.
[01:44:16.644 --> 01:44:20.787]  Leading competitors are $50, $60, $70 aren't as strong.
[01:44:21.208 --> 01:44:22.229]  It's normally a great deal at $39.
[01:44:22.569 --> 01:44:25.351]  We usually discount down to about $29.95.
[01:44:25.411 --> 01:44:27.253]  This is $19.95, but this is why this is so special.
[01:44:30.481 --> 01:44:33.583]  You're getting a free gift of a t-shirt.
[01:44:35.205 --> 01:44:36.646]  You're also getting free shipping.
[01:44:37.426 --> 01:44:40.789]  You're also getting double Patriot points instead of five points on the dollar.
[01:44:41.089 --> 01:44:42.891]  Ten cents on the dollar for your next order.
[01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:50.557]  You add all that together and we're losing about five dollars on every order of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:44:50.657 --> 01:44:52.338]  But I want you to try it.
[01:44:53.119 --> 01:44:58.243]  I want you to see how amazing it is because I believe you will then basically be hooked for life like I am.
[01:44:59.286 --> 01:45:02.227]  You talk about strength, stamina, endurance, focus.
[01:45:02.927 --> 01:45:03.668]  There's nothing like it.
[01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:05.729]  The ancients all knew about the power of the bones.
[01:45:05.769 --> 01:45:10.810]  They ground up the bones of horses and cows and chickens and put it in their bread.
[01:45:11.431 --> 01:45:14.432]  And in modern day, that's been taken out the last hundred years out of the bread.
[01:45:14.452 --> 01:45:18.073]  So there's a lot of places we're not getting the essence that's in the bone.
[01:45:18.453 --> 01:45:19.094]  The marrow.
[01:45:20.194 --> 01:45:27.659]  The things that are in the bone structure itself, but it's all in here in Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:28.039 --> 01:45:33.122]  It is the strongest formulation out there, the best, and it has the added benefit of funding the InfoWars.
[01:45:33.162 --> 01:45:36.224]  So, all supplies last right up until Christmas.
[01:45:36.504 --> 01:45:37.404]  We're going to sell out quick.
[01:45:37.785 --> 01:45:42.147]  Ultimate Bone Broth is, right now, the best deal you'll ever find, period.
[01:45:42.428 --> 01:45:47.310]  And you get the free t-shirt, free shipping and more at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[01:45:50.012 --> 01:45:56.493]  Alright, there's a couple of really big things that I forgot to tell you and Rob, who's shooting this ad, reminded me because I don't use a script.
[01:45:57.594 --> 01:46:00.334]  We have store-wide free shipping, not just on Ultimate Bone Brother.
[01:46:00.934 --> 01:46:05.135]  And we have 50 to 75% off across the entire store.
[01:46:05.475 --> 01:46:11.757]  On apparel, on water filtration, air filtration, storable food, everything is 50 to 75% off.
[01:46:12.197 --> 01:46:17.658]  And double Patriot points, instead of 5 cents on every dollar, it's 10 cents on every dollar on your future purchase.
[01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:19.159]  This is a big deal.
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:29.770]  X2, X3, Super Metal Vitality, Brain Force Plus, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and dozens of other amazing formulas at the lowest prices ever.
[01:46:30.311 --> 01:46:36.737]  Don't fight the traffic, don't fight the crowds, and support the InfoWar and get great products all at the same time.
[01:46:37.318 --> 01:46:38.019]  Everything 50 to 75% off.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:41.621]  Double Patriot points and store-wide free shipping.
[01:46:41.881 --> 01:46:44.242]  We're clearing out everything so we don't get hit with the inventory tax.
[01:46:44.742 --> 01:46:47.683]  And it's a big thank you to all of you who supported us over the years.
[01:46:48.063 --> 01:46:50.264]  And I think you'll love these products that you haven't tried so much.
[01:46:50.504 --> 01:46:54.085]  You'll become a regular customer and help fund us into the future under Global's attack.
[01:46:54.346 --> 01:46:55.126]  But again, thank you.
[01:46:55.166 --> 01:46:56.006]  Have a wonderful Christmas.
[01:46:56.026 --> 01:46:56.586]  God bless you.
[01:46:56.887 --> 01:46:58.407]  And thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[01:46:58.607 --> 01:47:00.528]  Without you we would be shut down a long time ago.
[01:47:00.668 --> 01:47:05.750]  So I salute you.
[01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:08.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:17.811 --> 01:47:29.658]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.338 --> 01:47:33.720]  Mark Dice is coming up the third hour live.
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:38.243]  Only place you get Mark Dice live is InfoHorse.
[01:47:38.423 --> 01:47:41.925]  It's a better job live, he does those viral videos.
[01:47:43.986 --> 01:47:44.807]  Look, here is the
[01:47:46.522 --> 01:47:55.284]  The bottom line, as they say, our country had half the world's wealth in 1955, with 4% of the world's population.
[01:47:56.425 --> 01:47:58.185]  We had more money than 96% of people.
[01:47:58.225 --> 01:47:59.166]  That means real assets.
[01:47:59.686 --> 01:48:01.906]  Because we had a middle class, that's what produces wealth.
[01:48:02.586 --> 01:48:05.747]  But the left teaches us having wealth made somebody else poor.
[01:48:05.847 --> 01:48:06.708]  No, that's not how it works.
[01:48:07.208 --> 01:48:09.708]  Real free market wealth creates more wealth like an engine.
[01:48:09.728 --> 01:48:11.669]  It's like alchemy.
[01:48:13.971 --> 01:48:21.579]  But Trump has come in trying to remind people what made us great, and he's under attack by the political establishment that sold us out.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:25.523]  And Scott Bronson, he makes a lot of great points during the breaks, one of our political relations guys.
[01:48:25.844 --> 01:48:28.206]  I've known Scott for years, probably 10-12 years.
[01:48:29.788 --> 01:48:31.209]  He's worked for another network before I hired him away.
[01:48:34.827 --> 01:48:36.349]  You made another good point about the Republicans.
[01:48:36.369 --> 01:48:40.415]  They're just a bunch of lawyers acting like they're conservatives trying to make a deal.
[01:48:40.755 --> 01:48:42.478]  On the Democrats, they're ideologues.
[01:48:42.558 --> 01:48:43.219]  They're a cult.
[01:48:43.639 --> 01:48:47.084]  They're the anti-America, anti-God, anti-Christ club.
[01:48:47.485 --> 01:48:48.907]  Restate what you just said during the break.
[01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:57.035]  I think that the Republicans are the people that people are voting for right now because they don't know what they want to do.
[01:48:57.115 --> 01:48:58.477]  So they're not going to mess everything up.
[01:48:58.877 --> 01:49:03.702]  But if you vote for the Democrats, they want a world that has no guns, no borders and everything.
[01:49:03.722 --> 01:49:05.644]  You can't say what you want.
[01:49:06.084 --> 01:49:07.545]  So that's not a world I want to live in.
[01:49:08.266 --> 01:49:11.567]  But the Republicans, they rely on, again, the tool of the loser.
[01:49:11.767 --> 01:49:12.447]  Compromise.
[01:49:12.547 --> 01:49:24.271]  They have no idea what they want to do, and they think that the things that they run on, that they want to do, that if they follow through with what they say, that somehow that's going to punish them.
[01:49:24.671 --> 01:49:26.592]  And everybody likes people that tell the truth.
[01:49:26.732 --> 01:49:31.634]  So if you actually run on truth, and follow through with what you're saying, people will love you.
[01:49:32.714 --> 01:49:35.075]  And they hide, they coward, and they wait.
[01:49:39.181 --> 01:49:43.946]  Because you're absolutely right when you ask, why are they coming after us?
[01:49:44.046 --> 01:49:45.387]  Why are the Republicans cowards?
[01:49:45.468 --> 01:49:46.328]  Why are they scared?
[01:49:47.029 --> 01:49:49.091]  It's because look at how they come after us.
[01:49:49.772 --> 01:49:51.454]  Look at how they demonize Infowars.
[01:49:51.914 --> 01:49:52.935]  The truth is popular.
[01:49:53.035 --> 01:49:53.776]  The truth is great.
[01:49:53.816 --> 01:49:54.577]  So they censor it.
[01:49:54.597 --> 01:49:55.158]  They block it.
[01:49:55.198 --> 01:49:55.738]  They sue it.
[01:49:56.038 --> 01:49:58.381]  They try to shut it down because the globalists can't compete with it.
[01:50:00.226 --> 01:50:00.907]  A hundred percent.
[01:50:01.168 --> 01:50:05.252]  And look, Trump has put more money in my pocket.
[01:50:05.613 --> 01:50:06.394]  That's a good thing.
[01:50:06.874 --> 01:50:09.938]  I know how to spend my money better than the government knows how to spend my money.
[01:50:09.958 --> 01:50:15.384]  But beyond that, the media, the corporate media says saying America exists is evil.
[01:50:16.161 --> 01:50:17.562]  That American flags are bad.
[01:50:17.622 --> 01:50:20.043]  That's obviously an outside foreign group.
[01:50:20.503 --> 01:50:25.466]  Like, aliens show up, they say, lower your flags, submit, you're scum, admit you're bad.
[01:50:25.566 --> 01:50:27.027]  I mean, this is 101.
[01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:38.353]  We're being taken over by people that literally, like, Apple runs the worst slave factories, pays people the worst, and uses the Communist Party to kill people that try to organize.
[01:50:38.393 --> 01:50:41.315]  Even the Communist Party tells Apple, you're too brutal.
[01:50:41.615 --> 01:50:43.016]  But because Tim Cook literally goes,
[01:50:43.796 --> 01:50:44.356]  I'm liberal.
[01:50:45.117 --> 01:50:45.617]  I'm gay.
[01:50:46.297 --> 01:50:46.958]  It's okay.
[01:50:47.058 --> 01:50:47.698]  It's sick.
[01:50:48.298 --> 01:50:48.718]  It's sick.
[01:50:48.738 --> 01:50:56.922]  It's like the left funding the Arab Spring, murdering over a million people, blowing up all these countries, and then the left's like, it's beautiful.
[01:50:57.283 --> 01:50:58.503]  No, it's not beautiful.
[01:50:58.543 --> 01:51:00.044]  You're sick, evil scum.
[01:51:02.547 --> 01:51:03.788]  Yeah, I don't get it.
[01:51:06.049 --> 01:51:08.511]  Me, myself, I'm more of a libertarian liberal.
[01:51:08.831 --> 01:51:10.012]  I'm a liberal person.
[01:51:11.632 --> 01:51:15.115]  But I cannot go to the left because they're against freedom.
[01:51:15.315 --> 01:51:18.637]  They're against everything that America used to be.
[01:51:19.751 --> 01:51:22.373]  Uh, they're terrifying.
[01:51:22.434 --> 01:51:25.216]  What they want is absolutely terrifying to me.
[01:51:25.917 --> 01:51:29.500]  So, because of that, I only have one side to go to.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:37.287]  And now, because they've moved their line so far to the left, that I could believe in everything that used to be center.
[01:51:38.286 --> 01:51:39.226]  Now I'm far right.
[01:51:39.727 --> 01:51:41.527]  Now I'm an evil person.
[01:51:41.608 --> 01:51:46.590]  Now I have to explain to my 12-year-old kid that you're a white guy.
[01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:48.611]  It's okay to be a white guy.
[01:51:48.771 --> 01:51:51.232]  Nobody wants to get after you and hurt you.
[01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:53.633]  But that's not the stuff that he sees.
[01:51:53.713 --> 01:51:58.155]  He sees things on the news about how white people are bad.
[01:51:58.295 --> 01:51:59.595]  White men are the cause of all things wrong.
[01:51:59.615 --> 01:52:02.777]  And it's the corporate media that is injecting the opposite of Martin Luther King
[01:52:04.099 --> 01:52:08.403]  And then we have to deal with it and we tell our kids, because my kids hear this too, and I go, no, it's not true.
[01:52:08.883 --> 01:52:10.204]  And they say, Daddy, are you racist?
[01:52:10.224 --> 01:52:11.585]  Because whites are inherently evil.
[01:52:12.426 --> 01:52:17.770]  And I'm like, no, that's... I've got to play a Martin Luther King clip saying everybody's good.
[01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:19.031]  It's what you stand for.
[01:52:19.511 --> 01:52:21.033]  And that makes sense to them.
[01:52:21.073 --> 01:52:24.235]  But that's how whacked out this globalist ideology is.
[01:52:24.275 --> 01:52:25.456]  Scott, keep up the great work.
[01:52:25.476 --> 01:52:25.917]  God bless you.
[01:52:26.477 --> 01:52:27.558]  Thanks.
[01:52:27.578 --> 01:52:28.439]  Mark Dice is coming up.
[01:52:29.827 --> 01:52:31.889]  And, you know, I've covered a lot of the breaking news.
[01:52:31.909 --> 01:52:33.751]  There's a lot of new breaking news in the last few hours.
[01:52:33.991 --> 01:52:37.675]  Trump has obviously chosen a new Attorney General nominee, William Barr.
[01:52:38.315 --> 01:52:39.116]  We're looking at that.
[01:52:39.577 --> 01:52:44.101]  You got Mueller set to release a bunch of his BS in the next hour.
[01:52:44.121 --> 01:52:45.683]  We're going to be tracking it all.
[01:52:45.703 --> 01:52:48.405]  We're going to have special live broadcasts this weekend on Saturday.
[01:52:48.425 --> 01:52:52.970]  We're going to have reporters on the ground in Paris for the white
[01:52:54.184 --> 01:52:57.186]  Jacket demonstration that threatens to bring down the whole EU combine.
[01:52:57.906 --> 01:53:00.047]  So as bad as it is, a lot of good things are happening.
[01:53:00.067 --> 01:53:01.268]  That's all coming up.
[01:53:03.769 --> 01:53:06.010]  And then I've got these other articles I haven't hit yet, too.
[01:53:06.130 --> 01:53:07.471]  I mean, I've got an article here in the US.
[01:53:07.491 --> 01:53:09.372]  It's on newswars.com.
[01:53:10.552 --> 01:53:15.855]  Teacher fired for not using the transgender student's new pronouns.
[01:53:17.619 --> 01:53:18.499]  It's always a new language.
[01:53:18.519 --> 01:53:24.181]  He goes, I'll call them by a girl's name, but I'm not going to speak this Martian ji-wang-kwang-gong-gong.
[01:53:24.501 --> 01:53:25.401]  They said, you're fired!
[01:53:25.421 --> 01:53:30.763]  And it's always more, more, more, more, isn't it?
[01:53:31.163 --> 01:53:32.863]  Controlling language, telling you what to do.
[01:53:33.244 --> 01:53:34.384]  We are in such a cult.
[01:53:36.374 --> 01:53:40.455]  And then I've got some really sarcastic, sickening stuff dealing with Schwarzenegger and Bernie Sanders.
[01:53:40.475 --> 01:53:42.835]  I don't know which one has a stupider sounding voice.
[01:53:43.555 --> 01:53:47.236]  Ah yes, do not drive cars, but I own 20 and jets!
[01:53:47.936 --> 01:53:55.238]  Or you've got... I'm Bernie Sanders, and you cannot have a carbon footprint or you should be arrested.
[01:53:55.718 --> 01:53:57.838]  But I have private jets as well.
[01:53:58.419 --> 01:54:01.999]  And I swindled universities for my money.
[01:54:02.059 --> 01:54:05.360]  Because I don't work, I steal your money.
[01:54:07.284 --> 01:54:09.966]  So that's all coming up as well here today.
[01:54:10.966 --> 01:54:13.007]  Listen, listeners, you're awesome.
[01:54:13.347 --> 01:54:13.948]  I salute you.
[01:54:14.568 --> 01:54:16.149]  I thank you over and over again.
[01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:22.213]  You are too amazing for me to even describe how cool you are.
[01:54:22.313 --> 01:54:29.697]  But this is a little bit beyond that, because InfoWars has now become a symbol in this fight.
[01:54:30.577 --> 01:54:33.099]  And if they can shut us down or keep us from transmitting,
[01:54:34.615 --> 01:54:35.996]  They think they've won the whole game.
[01:54:36.317 --> 01:54:38.078]  They're going to move on to everyone else that you've now seen.
[01:54:38.118 --> 01:54:43.723]  Now, I've got a few tricks up my sleeve, and I haven't really played them yet.
[01:54:43.743 --> 01:54:46.625]  We're going to start playing some of those here in the next few months.
[01:54:47.726 --> 01:54:50.868]  Let's just say I'm a general that fights from the front, politically.
[01:54:52.470 --> 01:55:01.657]  And if you'll simply not have horrible traffic, and not fight horrible crowds, and not get gouged on prices, and just go to InfoWarsTore.com with our secure, high-quality shopping cart,
[01:55:02.918 --> 01:55:06.880]  And get non-GMO heirloom seeds for the spring, or water filtration, or air filtration.
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:12.462]  The very best systems, or great supplements, or books, or videos, or t-shirts, or optics.
[01:55:13.422 --> 01:55:17.984]  Whatever the coolest, best-selling, highest-rated thing is, I go buy a bunch of them and sell them for a lower price.
[01:55:19.305 --> 01:55:20.505]  We have the 12 days of Christmas.
[01:55:21.446 --> 01:55:22.666]  We're now on, I think, day four of this.
[01:55:25.087 --> 01:55:26.968]  And we have free shipping store-wide.
[01:55:28.432 --> 01:55:32.755]  50 is the lowest discount, up to 75% off, so 50 or more storewide.
[01:55:33.135 --> 01:55:38.199]  Double Patriot points, so every order you get, not 5 cents on the next dollar, but 10 cents on the next dollar for the next order.
[01:55:38.679 --> 01:55:43.002]  And it gets even more insane, which is truly insane.
[01:55:43.982 --> 01:55:52.828]  A free, we are all Alex Jones, don't censor me, don't tread on me, black and white t-shirt, a really nice fabric, really comfortable t-shirt.
[01:55:53.148 --> 01:55:54.029]  You can pick your size.
[01:55:54.289 --> 01:55:55.490]  That's free shipping and the t-shirt.
[01:55:56.485 --> 01:55:58.027]  That's $10 right there on average.
[01:55:59.029 --> 01:56:05.198]  Well, if you're buying a tube of toothpaste that's already discounted, like Ploidal Silver, Iodine Fortified, Fluoride Free, Super Blue, it's for $7.
[01:56:05.238 --> 01:56:09.424]  You have to understand that I'm making like $3 on that, so I'm losing.
[01:56:12.335 --> 01:56:13.496]  I'm losing $10 on that.
[01:56:14.097 --> 01:56:15.959]  So that's how good these deals are.
[01:56:16.779 --> 01:56:19.202]  Everybody needs to get, we're on all Alex Jones.
[01:56:19.222 --> 01:56:23.426]  I said come up with the best selling t-shirt, I don't have my name on it, but it is kind of triggering and good to wear.
[01:56:23.967 --> 01:56:25.468]  Those shirts are going to sell out very soon though.
[01:56:25.788 --> 01:56:26.449]  Every order gets one.
[01:56:27.050 --> 01:56:32.115]  By Monday or even earlier, there'll be one of our other new shirts that you'll see up there when you get it.
[01:56:32.435 --> 01:56:33.596]  You pick the size, you'll be getting that shirt.
[01:56:33.616 --> 01:56:35.198]  But right now, it's still this shirt.
[01:56:36.345 --> 01:56:37.909]  Some other great shirts as well, so never fear.
[01:56:37.929 --> 01:56:43.581]  50 to 75% off, storewide free shipping on top of that, double Patriot points and a free t-shirt.
[01:56:45.063 --> 01:56:46.164]  You're insane.
[01:56:46.624 --> 01:56:50.507]  If you don't just go do some basic shopping, do all your shopping there.
[01:56:50.787 --> 01:56:52.028]  Give somebody a seed bank.
[01:56:52.408 --> 01:56:54.249]  Get them to plant in the spring.
[01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:56.611]  Give somebody a water filtration system.
[01:56:57.271 --> 01:57:02.635]  We sold out of the Alexa Pure Pro at that loss leader price, but now they have the Alexa Breeze.
[01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:04.376]  Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration.
[01:57:04.716 --> 01:57:05.697]  Made by the same great company.
[01:57:05.757 --> 01:57:06.918]  Five stage HEPA filter.
[01:57:07.818 --> 01:57:08.319]  I don't think so.
[01:57:27.837 --> 01:57:28.357]  Awesome.
[01:57:28.377 --> 01:57:28.958]  90-something bucks.
[01:57:28.998 --> 01:57:30.039]  We make 30-something bucks.
[01:57:30.379 --> 01:57:31.419]  Help fund the InfoWar.
[01:57:31.439 --> 01:57:33.801]  You cannot beat this for your house, for your family.
[01:57:34.621 --> 01:57:36.583]  And you just clean off the filters and put them right back in.
[01:57:36.603 --> 01:57:41.366]  Alexa Pure Breeze is now at InfoWarStore.com for $127.
[01:57:42.006 --> 01:57:43.547]  It's a steal at $249.
[01:57:43.927 --> 01:57:44.628]  It's at $127.
[01:57:44.928 --> 01:57:46.769]  You'll never see this deal again.
[01:57:47.049 --> 01:57:48.771]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice.
[01:57:48.791 --> 01:57:49.231]  Stay with us.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:58:01.267]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[01:58:01.567 --> 01:58:12.696]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.
[01:58:12.976 --> 01:58:20.803]  So get great products and help fund the InfoWars right now with the 12 Days of Christmas that is special amongst a group of incredible sales.
[01:58:24.065 --> 01:58:30.511]  Up to 75% off on top sellers, including free shipping, double patriot points, and unprecedented daily specials.
[01:58:30.851 --> 01:58:37.877]  Santa Claus isn't real, but the new world order and the globalists trying to destroy our nation's sovereignty and trying to shut down the free press is.
[01:58:38.277 --> 01:58:46.324]  And that's why when you get great products at InfoWareStore.com, you don't just give yourself the gift of high quality supplements or storable foods or incredible water filtration.
[01:58:46.644 --> 01:58:52.207]  No, you give yourself the gift of funding the First Amendment in a desperate attempt to save this country.
[01:58:52.747 --> 01:58:57.830]  Even though InfoWars has delivered the fight against tyranny like no other, we're not just asking for your support.
[01:58:58.190 --> 01:59:02.152]  We're asking you to have a 360 win because this is the biggest sale of the year.
[01:59:02.372 --> 01:59:14.379]  We're extending store-wide free shipping up to 75% off of best-selling items, double Patriot points, and for the 12 days of Christmas leading up to Christmas, every day we have one particular special that is up to 75% off.
[01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:24.468]  Now more than ever, InfoWars needs your support to continue to promote the spirit of liberty and Americana that truly is the Christmas spirit.

[02:00:15.798 --> 02:00:34.770]  On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha You can listen to the engine moaning out his one-note song You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
[02:00:36.505 --> 02:00:42.667]  All right, Mark Dice, best-selling author, political analyst, news analyst, will be joining us.
[02:00:42.767 --> 02:00:47.088]  We are carrying his new book, Liberalism, Find a Cure.
[02:00:48.088 --> 02:00:54.570]  Everybody should get it at infowarsstore.com, have a piece of history on your shelf, or buy two copies and donate one to the library.
[02:00:54.971 --> 02:00:56.531]  That is an act of incredible resistance.
[02:00:56.551 --> 02:00:59.592]  You know, don't just love these great people out there, there's not many of them.
[02:01:01.388 --> 02:01:06.250]  Like a Matt Drudge, like a Mark Dice, like a Paul Joseph Watson trying to get Paul to write a book.
[02:01:06.671 --> 02:01:07.251]  Write a book!
[02:01:08.471 --> 02:01:11.273]  And then, when they write a book, buy the book and support them.
[02:01:11.573 --> 02:01:13.934]  No reviews yet because we just got it at the store a few days ago.
[02:01:13.974 --> 02:01:15.875]  We now have it in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:01:16.135 --> 02:01:19.496]  Here's one of his latest reports where he breaks all this down.
[02:01:19.516 --> 02:01:20.337]  They just can't stop.
[02:01:21.445 --> 02:01:22.566]  President George H.W.
[02:01:22.586 --> 02:01:33.457]  Bush's funeral was yesterday, but the liberal media couldn't take a break from their non-stop Trump trashing and decided to use the occasion to continue to complain about the current president.
[02:01:33.637 --> 02:01:42.226]  But what becomes undeniably obvious with every bio run about Bush 41 is that stark contrast between these two men.
[02:01:42.586 --> 02:01:50.953]  Over the last two years, deviancy has continued being defined down by this current president, his cronies, his supporters.
[02:01:51.153 --> 02:01:56.297]  Look, Donald Trump is 180 from who George H.W.
[02:01:56.317 --> 02:01:56.717]  Bush is.
[02:01:56.778 --> 02:01:57.378]  Thank God!
[02:01:57.558 --> 02:02:01.261]  The world looked to George Bush because he was a leader respected.
[02:02:01.501 --> 02:02:02.682]  He had proven himself.
[02:02:03.223 --> 02:02:04.564]  This president has yet to do that.
[02:02:04.972 --> 02:02:09.934]  This president that we have now is trying to unravel everything that he did and Obama did.
[02:02:09.954 --> 02:02:12.795]  I think he's doing this because he feels he has to do it.
[02:02:13.215 --> 02:02:20.558]  I can't help but wonder if there was a thought bubble over Donald Trump's head just now, what he was thinking.
[02:02:20.578 --> 02:02:23.279]  I have to imagine he was thinking, how much longer do I have to stand here?
[02:02:23.359 --> 02:02:27.201]  We may not approve of this current president, but that doesn't diminish one's respect for the office.
[02:02:27.381 --> 02:02:29.262]  Because there are a lot of things about George H.W.
[02:02:29.302 --> 02:02:32.945]  Bush that maybe people now appreciate that they didn't appreciate at the time.
[02:02:33.405 --> 02:02:43.032]  It just gives you a sense of the big character of the man and the contrast with the small character we see.
[02:02:43.812 --> 02:02:44.613]  Uh, we see today.
[02:02:44.973 --> 02:02:57.401]  George Bush believed in the institutions of government, which I think too is another reason why this moment to remember and to compare and contrast is so important because our institutions are so under siege right now by the government itself.
[02:02:57.741 --> 02:03:00.403]  And that is why we celebrate George H.W.
[02:03:00.443 --> 02:03:05.427]  Bush's legacy and fear the next two years of Mr. Trump's wild
[02:03:06.227 --> 02:03:07.228]  White House ride.
[02:03:07.488 --> 02:03:17.297]  Welcome back and we're still chatting with our panel about that moment at the Bush 41 funeral when the Trumps walked in and the air turned ice cold as he hit the pew.
[02:03:18.318 --> 02:03:30.009]  And Paul, one thing I've seen with a lot of criticism of President Trump in social media and elsewhere, I have seen some conservatives criticizing Hillary Clinton who nodded at Melania Trump but did not acknowledge the President of the United
[02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:34.931]  Well, that's certainly a very unique way to pay tribute to a former president by trashing their current one.
[02:03:35.412 --> 02:03:37.553]  Look what they even put on the lower third.
[02:03:37.573 --> 02:03:41.795]  Trump awkwardly greets ex-presidents at Bush 41 funeral.
[02:03:57.102 --> 02:04:00.625]  Actually, the only thing that looked awkward during the funeral was Hillary Clinton!
[02:04:00.986 --> 02:04:02.487]  The heck is she doing here?
[02:04:02.687 --> 02:04:06.250]  The poor woman can't even stand at a podium without breaking out into a coughing fit.
[02:04:06.531 --> 02:04:10.494]  She can't walk down a flight of stairs without slipping and spraining her wrist.
[02:04:10.894 --> 02:04:14.658]  And now she can't even sit in a chair without looking like she's about to pass out!
[02:04:14.878 --> 02:04:22.384]  You saw the President of the United States, President Trump, sitting there watching all of this, not given a role to speak, pretty unusual for an incumbent president.
[02:04:22.784 --> 02:04:24.766]  At times seemed to be a little defiant.
[02:04:24.806 --> 02:04:36.775]  He held his hands up, arms up like this, as if he wasn't quite happy with what he was hearing, but otherwise kept quiet, decided not to make any remarks to spoil the occasion.
[02:04:36.835 --> 02:04:40.238]  So, you know, it was a coming together for Washington, I think.
[02:04:40.458 --> 02:04:44.040]  You know, I don't like Donald Trump at all, but at least he didn't ruin George H.W.
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:46.041]  Bush's funeral like we all thought he would!
[02:04:46.361 --> 02:04:58.266]  Even little Ben Shapiro, Bill Kristol's neocon protege, revealed his true colors again, tweeting out a photo of the current and past president, saying, These three dudes are the best that we could come up with, and the latest alternative was the terrible lady on the end?
[02:04:58.486 --> 02:05:02.228]  Common decency, Ben, would be to withhold your criticism until maybe...
[02:05:03.263 --> 02:05:07.084]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[02:05:07.424 --> 02:05:14.047]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[02:06:12.559 --> 02:06:20.450]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:33.308 --> 02:06:35.370]  It's Friday, December 7th, 2018.
[02:06:35.450 --> 02:06:37.912]  One of my favorite people, Mark Dice, is here with us.
[02:06:38.473 --> 02:06:45.098]  Dr. Nick Baggage is going to be hosting in-studio here coming up in the fourth hour today in the War Room with Owen Schroer, Roger Stone, and others.
[02:06:45.739 --> 02:06:53.366]  Well, what a critical day with the fake Mueller report, Mueller report set to come out, the new Attorney General that's been nominated by Trump, William Barr.
[02:06:53.386 --> 02:06:57.930]  We'll be looking at it all, but Mark Dice, media analyst, best-selling author,
[02:06:59.116 --> 02:07:02.777]  Billions of views on YouTube alone is here with us for the balance of the hour.
[02:07:02.817 --> 02:07:03.617]  MarkDice.com.
[02:07:03.957 --> 02:07:06.197]  His new book, Liberalism Find a Cure by Mark Dice.
[02:07:06.217 --> 02:07:07.898]  Remember those things called books?
[02:07:08.098 --> 02:07:08.398]  Get it.

[02:07:10.658 --> 02:07:11.538]  Donate to the library.

[02:07:13.379 --> 02:07:14.299]  Every little bit counts.
[02:07:14.419 --> 02:07:15.199]  No reviews yet.
[02:07:15.839 --> 02:07:18.280]  It's gone to like number one in political on Amazon.
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:19.680]  We got it a few weeks after.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:23.220]  We now have it at InfoWareStore.com, so no reviews there, but five-star reviews.
[02:07:23.561 --> 02:07:24.101]  I've read the book.
[02:07:24.261 --> 02:07:24.821]  It's amazing.
[02:07:25.061 --> 02:07:25.741]  Get the book today.
[02:07:26.061 --> 02:07:26.201]  I'm
[02:07:43.258 --> 02:07:46.641]  What do you want to hit front and center right now?
[02:07:46.681 --> 02:07:50.866]  I mean, I know one of your latest reports is on this fawning for George H.W.
[02:07:50.906 --> 02:07:54.730]  Bush, this New World Order guy, and then the attacks on Trump.
[02:07:55.270 --> 02:08:01.076]  One of the top Chi-Com operatives who builds spy chips in the cell phones gets arrested by the U.S.
[02:08:01.156 --> 02:08:02.758]  I mean, where do you want to start?
[02:08:02.798 --> 02:08:04.740]  This is just a crazy time to be alive right now.
[02:08:05.953 --> 02:08:06.693]  Great to be with you.
[02:08:06.733 --> 02:08:08.994]  I do want to get into some of the madness in Hollywood.
[02:08:09.074 --> 02:08:12.035]  The Oscars debacle with Kevin Hart now having to step down.
[02:08:12.075 --> 02:08:13.096]  He was going to host them.
[02:08:13.176 --> 02:08:19.198]  But first of all, regarding liberalism and the mental disorder that it is, there is... I mean, it's not a joke.
[02:08:19.218 --> 02:08:20.219]  This isn't hyperbole.
[02:08:20.259 --> 02:08:24.620]  It really is some kind of a defect or a disease or a mental disorder.
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:31.623]  In fact, there was a documentary produced by PBS hosted by David Eagleman, which you can find on Netflix or Prime, maybe even on YouTube.
[02:08:32.124 --> 02:08:39.344]  Where he went to a neural imaging laboratory at Virginia Tech and one of the neurologists there discovered an interesting connection.
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:53.885]  By scanning people's brains, he has determined a test that with a 95% accuracy, he can tell from an MRI or an fMRI, a functional MRI, whether or not someone is a liberal or a conservative.
[02:08:54.145 --> 02:08:56.886]  And so that leads many people to wonder, well, what's the difference?
[02:08:56.966 --> 02:09:01.087]  How can you tell from a brain scan whether someone is a left-wing or right-wing person?
[02:09:01.507 --> 02:09:02.948]  And the answer makes perfect sense.
[02:09:03.726 --> 02:09:12.732]  What he did is, these people in the MRI, he showed them images of disgusting things like dead bodies and food being eaten by maggots.
[02:09:13.172 --> 02:09:22.539]  Anything that any normal person should be disgusted and repelled by, just from the normal protective mechanisms that have been built into the human brain.
[02:09:23.314 --> 02:09:28.139]  And liberals do not feel the levels of disgust that normal people do.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:37.630]  And in fact, the less they feel disgusted towards seeing or experiencing what normal people see as disgusting things,
[02:09:38.334 --> 02:09:43.717]  The more liberal they are, which makes perfect sense because the liberals' brains are defective.
[02:09:44.017 --> 02:09:45.398]  They can't see right and wrong.
[02:09:45.418 --> 02:09:46.958]  Their consciences are seared.
[02:09:47.218 --> 02:09:51.821]  The Bible calls it the reprobate mind because they've turned themselves over to evil.
[02:09:52.181 --> 02:09:56.003]  And now this poor neurologist at Virginia Tech's imaging laboratory
[02:09:56.563 --> 02:10:00.427]  He's horrified really at his findings because think of the implications of this.
[02:10:00.767 --> 02:10:09.375]  He has proved that liberals have no conscience, that when they see something that should absolutely freak out a normal person, they feel nothing.
[02:10:09.415 --> 02:10:13.259]  They see nothing wrong with it because their minds are literally defective.
[02:10:14.008 --> 02:10:17.651]  You just said one of the deepest things I've ever heard, and you're absolutely right.
[02:10:17.691 --> 02:10:18.512]  This is everything.
[02:10:18.532 --> 02:10:20.713]  Because it's not just this one MRI study.
[02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:31.682]  They found that, and we call it the modern term, just like gay used to mean, let's have a gay old time, yabba-dee-yabba-doo time on the Flintstones.
[02:10:32.162 --> 02:10:33.563]  Now that word's been taken away.
[02:10:33.583 --> 02:10:34.403]  You've made that point.
[02:10:35.023 --> 02:10:36.844]  So now we call them liberal.
[02:10:36.884 --> 02:10:38.305]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[02:10:38.585 --> 02:10:49.250]  When Pompeo said, America wants to defend the liberal order again, that means more personal freedom, more taxes, more Second Amendment rights, more property rights.
[02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:52.252]  Liberal just means, you know, more or more open.
[02:10:53.072 --> 02:10:54.113]  They're really leftist.
[02:10:54.293 --> 02:10:56.294]  So when they do the studies and say liberals,
[02:10:57.242 --> 02:10:59.823]  are mentally ill, they're sociopathic or psychotic.
[02:10:59.983 --> 02:11:00.863]  Every study shows it.
[02:11:01.263 --> 02:11:03.404]  Nine times more likely in British and U.S.
[02:11:03.424 --> 02:11:03.724]  studies.
[02:11:03.884 --> 02:11:04.485]  Show the same thing.
[02:11:04.545 --> 02:11:05.145]  Major universities.
[02:11:05.485 --> 02:11:06.625]  Liberals did this.
[02:11:06.945 --> 02:11:12.627]  They found that, quote, liberals, really leftists, are more likely to virtue signal but not actually give to charity.
[02:11:12.688 --> 02:11:14.348]  Nine times less likely to give to charity.
[02:11:14.908 --> 02:11:16.409]  Six times more likely to steal.
[02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:20.230]  They found it in Russia, in Japan, in the United States.
[02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:22.151]  So what they are is they're sociopaths
[02:11:22.651 --> 02:11:30.073]  That have no moral compass, but they know we have them, so they project it out because that gets power over us.
[02:11:30.634 --> 02:11:35.455]  And so what you're saying is absolutely true, that they actually like disgusting things.
[02:11:35.475 --> 02:11:39.897]  They like two-year-olds being taught they're really a girl or a boy and being screwed up.
[02:11:40.257 --> 02:11:48.699]  They like child pornography as vice, and the New York Times, and all these other things promote.
[02:11:48.959 --> 02:11:50.400]  These really are evil people.
[02:11:51.198 --> 02:11:58.526]  Two years ago, maybe even longer, I'm losing track of time, I posted a video where I interviewed people in the San Diego boardwalk about incest.
[02:11:58.907 --> 02:12:06.335]  And whether or not they thought that incest was disgusting or wrong, as long as it was between two adults.
[02:12:06.355 --> 02:12:11.721]  Whether that be a brother and a sister, or a father and his daughter, as long as she was 18 years old.
[02:12:13.102 --> 02:12:16.805]  And many of the people here in San Diego said that that was totally fine.
[02:12:17.185 --> 02:12:27.532]  And they saw no difference between an incestuous relationship between an 18-year-old girl or woman and her father or a brother and a sister.
[02:12:27.892 --> 02:12:35.778]  And they said that that's totally no different than a consenting heterosexual couple or a consenting LGBT couple.
[02:12:36.338 --> 02:12:40.241]  Because they, their minds are literally defective.
[02:12:40.261 --> 02:12:43.463]  And you can watch that, it's on YouTube and people were stunned when it first came out.
[02:12:44.103 --> 02:12:51.628]  And now we're actually seeing the LGBT community embracing incest as part of their community.
[02:12:51.989 --> 02:12:56.872]  And some of them are calling it GSA, genetically sexually attracted couples.
[02:12:57.232 --> 02:13:04.137]  We're seeing stories in the news of couples that are fathers and daughters and sons and their mothers.
[02:13:04.977 --> 02:13:15.104]  And the leftists, the far left now, they see no difference between that and a normal heterosexual couple and LGBT couple.
[02:13:15.504 --> 02:13:17.786]  And years ago people would joke, well what's next?
[02:13:17.886 --> 02:13:18.906]  Is it incest?
[02:13:19.066 --> 02:13:21.408]  And unfortunately that's what is next.
[02:13:21.648 --> 02:13:22.529]  You can't make this up.
[02:13:22.849 --> 02:13:32.195]  It is horrifying and that's why in my book, Liberalism, Find a Care, I've been tracking this for so long and even for people who have been following the news pretty closely, it's far worse than you could possibly imagine.
[02:13:32.675 --> 02:13:42.623]  And what I've been seeing for years, and documenting and assessing and compiling and tracking the trends, now we're starting to see it bubble up over the surface.
[02:13:42.723 --> 02:13:52.010]  Because NBC News is now highlighting couples who are raising their children gender-neutral, the they-bees, it's not a boy or a girl.
[02:13:52.110 --> 02:14:00.393]  Well, in Texas, they're taking people's children away if the school convinces a six-year-old to start chemical castration, and the parents say, no, the kid's taken away.
[02:14:00.874 --> 02:14:02.754]  And as you said, we would always say, what's next?
[02:14:03.115 --> 02:14:04.875]  Incest, bestiality, pedophilia?
[02:14:05.175 --> 02:14:07.997]  It's all being promoted now.
[02:14:08.117 --> 02:14:09.997]  It's all being pushed.
[02:14:10.177 --> 02:14:11.158]  It's unbelievable.
[02:14:11.218 --> 02:14:13.439]  And you can't swing a stick.
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:21.265]  In a major city now, and not find where two-year-olds, three-year-olds, five-year-olds are being confused and jacked with.
[02:14:21.285 --> 02:14:27.450]  And the left saying, oh, they're allowed to be of age now to decide they want to be sterilized.
[02:14:27.811 --> 02:14:29.252]  No, that's called child abuse.
[02:14:29.292 --> 02:14:30.272]  This is so insane.
[02:14:31.774 --> 02:14:43.743]  And just a few weeks ago at Good Morning America, they had an 11-year-old drag kid on named Desmond Is Amazing, whose parents, since he was even younger, have been dressing him up in drag and
[02:14:45.918 --> 02:14:51.320]  I know that you've covered the Austin, Texas Drag Queen Festival, where of course there were children there.
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:15:01.484]  And if you just criticize those parents, if you dare to say that that's wrong or use even more harsh language, then that's considered to be divisive.
[02:15:01.544 --> 02:15:02.725]  That's the new buzzword.
[02:15:02.745 --> 02:15:05.046]  Let's be clear, it was two-year-olds walking up
[02:15:05.586 --> 02:15:10.530]  Putting money in g-strings of obese men wearing wigs who are shaking their asses in children's faces.
[02:15:10.791 --> 02:15:12.232]  We've had TV station complaints.
[02:15:12.272 --> 02:15:13.833]  We will not even show the full footage here.
[02:15:14.234 --> 02:15:21.140]  Men, totally naked except for glitter on their large, large genitals, hugging small children.
[02:15:23.010 --> 02:15:45.150]  Parents would have been arrested for child abuse but now you can't even criticize it even mildly which is why I had to put it into the book because I gotta be careful if I just use the wrong word on a YouTube video or maybe even the wrong tone of voice then I'll get disappeared down the memory hole as Tim Cook now is saying that just people who are divisive aren't supposed to be allowed to have the internet now so it's not even just
[02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:53.235]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:16:10.475 --> 02:16:11.915]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:16:12.155 --> 02:16:17.096]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[02:16:18.257 --> 02:16:24.178]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:16:24.938 --> 02:16:32.600]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:59.554]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[02:17:00.791 --> 02:17:07.114]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[02:17:07.574 --> 02:17:09.314]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[02:17:09.374 --> 02:17:14.296]  I love my state, but if you've got a business and a company here and you've got merchandise, BS.
[02:17:14.757 --> 02:17:15.257]  It's big.
[02:17:15.797 --> 02:17:16.217]  It's bad.
[02:17:16.657 --> 02:17:21.879]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[02:17:21.899 --> 02:17:24.200]  You know they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[02:17:24.621 --> 02:17:27.842]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[02:17:28.442 --> 02:17:29.405]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:17:29.425 --> 02:17:30.609]  That's been going on for over a month.
[02:17:31.371 --> 02:17:32.595]  50 to 75% off.
[02:17:32.615 --> 02:17:33.638]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[02:17:34.687 --> 02:17:35.648]  The Double Patriot points.
[02:17:35.668 --> 02:17:36.569]  That's what happened in about a week.
[02:17:36.929 --> 02:17:43.555]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[02:17:44.015 --> 02:17:48.399]  Infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:17:48.419 --> 02:17:50.300]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:52.382]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:17:52.562 --> 02:17:54.624]  And don't fight the crowds at infowarsstore.com.
[02:17:54.784 --> 02:17:58.807]  And for myself and the Infowars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[02:18:02.205 --> 02:18:04.686]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:18:05.126 --> 02:18:05.986]  I'm too weak!
[02:18:06.046 --> 02:18:07.086]  Oh, don't kill me!
[02:18:07.106 --> 02:18:07.566]  Please!

[02:18:43.976 --> 02:18:45.858]  Life is fiery with its beauty.
[02:18:46.478 --> 02:18:48.120]  You have no place.
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:50.022]  Unlock your human potential.
[02:18:50.082 --> 02:18:51.644]  You have no home here.
[02:18:51.824 --> 02:18:52.585]  Defeat the global
[02:18:55.160 --> 02:18:57.845]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:19:25.661 --> 02:19:28.101]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:19:31.886 --> 02:19:35.569]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?

[02:20:12.552 --> 02:20:17.475]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[02:20:19.056 --> 02:20:27.882]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum, who are beholden to scum!
[02:20:28.362 --> 02:20:29.643]  Russian scum!
[02:20:37.264 --> 02:20:37.825]  Please listen.

[02:20:46.998 --> 02:20:49.542]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:20:58.747 --> 02:20:59.207]  Lock the door!
[02:20:59.227 --> 02:20:59.828]  They're coming!
[02:21:00.108 --> 02:21:01.088]  They're coming!

[02:21:02.729 --> 02:21:03.410]  They're coming!

[02:21:04.390 --> 02:21:05.051]  Listen to me!
[02:21:05.331 --> 02:21:05.731]  Listen!
[02:21:05.791 --> 02:21:06.631]  Help me!
[02:21:07.132 --> 02:21:07.572]  You're next!

[02:21:08.372 --> 02:21:08.753]  Please!
[02:21:08.993 --> 02:21:09.453]  You're next!
[02:21:09.493 --> 02:21:10.374]  We're in danger!
[02:21:10.554 --> 02:21:11.394]  Please listen to me!
[02:21:11.454 --> 02:21:12.555]  It's something terrible!
[02:21:12.755 --> 02:21:13.475]  Please!
[02:21:13.515 --> 02:21:13.855]  You're next!
[02:21:13.895 --> 02:21:14.636]  You're the end!
[02:21:14.876 --> 02:21:15.837]  They're already here!
[02:21:16.737 --> 02:21:16.897]  Help!
[02:21:17.077 --> 02:21:17.918]  You're next!
[02:21:17.998 --> 02:21:18.538]  They're coming!
[02:21:18.598 --> 02:21:19.499]  They're coming!
[02:21:20.299 --> 02:21:21.059]  Sleep.
[02:21:21.139 --> 02:21:22.220]  The seed is planted.
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:23.081]  Sleep.
[02:21:24.221 --> 02:21:25.062]  Sleep.
[02:21:25.182 --> 02:21:26.322]  Terror grows.
[02:21:26.562 --> 02:21:26.923]  Sleep.
[02:21:28.503 --> 02:21:28.964]  Wake up!
[02:21:28.984 --> 02:21:30.324]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[02:21:30.344 --> 02:21:31.165]  Sit up!
[02:21:31.785 --> 02:21:33.906]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:37.367]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:21:37.447 --> 02:21:38.508]  Is it contagious?
[02:21:39.028 --> 02:21:39.228]  Mom!
[02:21:39.788 --> 02:21:40.969]  Brianna, help me!
[02:21:41.009 --> 02:21:42.029]  It looked right at me.
[02:21:42.049 --> 02:21:43.130]  You need to get out!
[02:21:43.170 --> 02:21:44.731]  They're looking at us as if it was human.
[02:21:44.771 --> 02:21:45.411]  We're not human.
[02:21:47.332 --> 02:21:50.493]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:21:50.533 --> 02:21:52.254]  We're being cornered!
[02:21:52.334 --> 02:21:55.915]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:21:55.936 --> 02:21:57.056]  They're barricading the street.
[02:22:22.719 --> 02:22:26.680]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:29.161]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:31.341]  And Mark Dice is riding a shotgun with us.
[02:22:31.421 --> 02:22:33.102]  New book, he's a best-selling author.
[02:22:33.362 --> 02:22:34.322]  Liberalism, Find a Cure.
[02:22:34.342 --> 02:22:37.363]  Everybody should get it at InfoWarsTore.com or MarkDice.com.
[02:22:37.663 --> 02:22:38.323]  Get it at Amazon.
[02:22:38.723 --> 02:22:39.983]  He makes no money, I make no money.
[02:22:40.003 --> 02:22:41.444]  Doesn't help fund us, but whatever.
[02:22:41.484 --> 02:22:42.144]  The book gets out.
[02:22:42.804 --> 02:22:43.644]  Mark, just putting books in.
[02:22:43.664 --> 02:22:44.845]  He says, I want to get into the Oscars.
[02:22:44.905 --> 02:22:45.825]  I want to get into Trump.
[02:22:45.845 --> 02:22:48.906]  I want to get into China with you and have you really cover the waterfront here.
[02:22:49.646 --> 02:22:50.326]  But finishing up,
[02:22:51.724 --> 02:22:53.045]  It's all over.
[02:22:53.085 --> 02:22:57.008]  People all over Austin are telling their young boys they're a girl or girls they're a boy.
[02:22:57.949 --> 02:22:58.609]  It's a cult.
[02:22:59.050 --> 02:23:00.251]  They're sexualizing them.
[02:23:00.771 --> 02:23:03.053]  It's all over the news that pedophilia is good suddenly.
[02:23:03.293 --> 02:23:06.375]  I mean, this is really the final frontier.
[02:23:06.495 --> 02:23:08.977]  If we'll put up with that, teachers in the U.S.
[02:23:09.017 --> 02:23:13.881]  are being fired if they refuse to use weird cult, you know, Xenu pronouns.
[02:23:15.062 --> 02:23:16.043]  Where does this end?
[02:23:16.063 --> 02:23:17.944]  I mean, obviously it's about depopulation.
[02:23:17.964 --> 02:23:18.605]  Where is it going?
[02:23:19.005 --> 02:23:21.347]  As they celebrate the total fall of culture.
[02:23:22.492 --> 02:23:29.057]  Yeah, the culture is cancerous and it's almost too late to even interact with certain segments of it or to have your kids in public schools.
[02:23:29.077 --> 02:23:32.039]  You're going to have to put them in private schools to avoid this madness.
[02:23:32.499 --> 02:23:38.283]  Planned Parenthood just tweeted out last night an article by someone who said, well, the future's not female.
[02:23:38.323 --> 02:23:39.484]  That's a big slogan of theirs.
[02:23:39.504 --> 02:23:40.584]  You know, the future's female.
[02:23:40.624 --> 02:23:42.306]  The future's female, not equality.
[02:23:42.366 --> 02:23:43.586]  It's they want to dominate, of course.
[02:23:43.807 --> 02:23:47.149]  But now that's still not good enough because that's offensive.
[02:23:47.729 --> 02:24:03.037]  Now the future they say is non-binary and they're upset about the TERFs, the transgender exclusionary feminists who are fighting for feminism but they don't go along with this transgender choose your own gender identity.
[02:24:03.057 --> 02:24:07.119]  Like the women all getting famous feminists are being banned off Twitter because they say no men are not women.
[02:24:07.719 --> 02:24:16.488]  The sky is blue, 2 plus 2 equals 4, they're banned too because they're making way for, you wrote about this in some of your books, this whole transhuman microchip everything.
[02:24:16.908 --> 02:24:20.171]  We're going to have to say clones are real, we're going to have to give rights to robots.
[02:24:20.471 --> 02:24:28.960]  They're getting us ready just saying a man doesn't have a uterus, but he doesn't have a cervix, but you'll go to jail, you'll be fired if he comes in and wants a pap smear.
[02:24:29.912 --> 02:24:52.690]  Four years ago now was when the Mozilla CEO, the creator of the Firefox browser software, was fired, pushed out of his job, the creator and CEO of the company, because it was discovered that six years earlier, he donated like a thousand dollars of his own personal money to Proposition 8 in California, which would have defined marriage as just between a man and a woman.
[02:24:53.230 --> 02:25:00.513]  And so six years later they discovered that he did that, pushed him out of his job for simply supporting marriage between a man and a woman.
[02:25:00.533 --> 02:25:06.196]  We're getting to the point where if you just simply say, marriage is between a man and a woman, I don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[02:25:06.416 --> 02:25:08.897]  They can say two plus two equals five, it doesn't make it so.
[02:25:09.577 --> 02:25:11.218]  I'm not going to use that term.
[02:25:12.038 --> 02:25:12.478]  I think so.
[02:25:33.947 --> 02:25:42.073]  They were eating their own yesterday, comedian Kevin Hart, who was chosen to host the Oscars because the Oscars were previously criticized for being too white.
[02:25:42.093 --> 02:25:44.494]  You remember the hashtag, Oscars so white.
[02:25:44.855 --> 02:25:55.482]  So they found the social justice warrior, affirmative action hire Kevin Hart to host, but then somebody went and bugged through his previous tweets from almost a decade ago.
[02:25:56.122 --> 02:26:01.824]  And he was making some jokes about some gay people and how he didn't want to have a gay son and a whole bit about it.
[02:26:02.284 --> 02:26:04.025]  And so now they said that that's hateful.
[02:26:04.425 --> 02:26:07.966]  And to see the evolution of his downfall was quite fascinating.
[02:26:07.986 --> 02:26:09.066]  It happened very, very quick.
[02:26:09.346 --> 02:26:12.567]  First, he posted on his Instagram, you know, these people need to get a life.
[02:26:12.967 --> 02:26:23.651]  You know, if you're nitpicking tweets from 10 years ago and you can't understand that people grow and people change and don't feed the trolls and these people are finding things to get offensive about, he's like, yeah, whatever.
[02:26:24.251 --> 02:26:42.246]  And then, maybe an hour later, he got the call from the handlers and they said, hey, if you don't apologize and have a scripted, pre-planned, in-depth apology and probably go do some community service or invite some LGBT folks over for Christmas dinner, then you're out.
[02:26:42.526 --> 02:26:46.029]  And to his credit, at first, he said, I'm not going to apologize.
[02:26:46.149 --> 02:26:48.471]  You know, if they don't want to have me host, that's fine.
[02:26:48.731 --> 02:26:51.773]  He's already apologized multiple times in previous interviews.
[02:26:51.813 --> 02:26:52.834]  I think Rolling Stone even.
[02:26:52.854 --> 02:26:57.698]  A whole bunch of interviews, he said, hey, yeah, okay, so some of that stuff, you know, you can't say that today.
[02:26:57.718 --> 02:27:00.840]  It was a different time, you know, back 10 years ago, obviously it was.
[02:27:01.421 --> 02:27:07.185]  And then he got the talk from the rest of his team and then came the detailed, I'm terribly sorry.
[02:27:07.205 --> 02:27:09.927]  I will, you know, I make amends.
[02:27:10.227 --> 02:27:11.128]  I am evolving.
[02:27:11.168 --> 02:27:14.751]  And so at first, it looked like he was standing up to the bullies and saying, hey,
[02:27:15.231 --> 02:27:17.532]  You don't want to host the Oscars?
[02:27:17.712 --> 02:27:18.273]  That's fine.
[02:27:18.293 --> 02:27:19.533]  I don't need to do that.
[02:27:19.933 --> 02:27:21.494]  And then came the apology.
[02:27:21.914 --> 02:27:23.115]  It's just incredible.
[02:27:23.415 --> 02:27:28.017]  So now the Oscars and Grammys, all these award shows are just Hollywood propaganda.
[02:27:28.417 --> 02:27:30.698]  Constantly pushing the far left agenda.
[02:27:31.079 --> 02:27:37.081]  So now it's going to be interesting to see, because of this controversy, they're going to inject even more of that into the show.
[02:27:37.101 --> 02:27:38.042]  But let me ask you this question.
[02:27:38.062 --> 02:27:40.043]  We're going to come back and get more into this.
[02:27:41.992 --> 02:27:44.514]  Record low viewers to all these horrible Hollywood shows.
[02:27:44.654 --> 02:27:45.514]  All of it's falling apart.
[02:27:45.554 --> 02:27:46.635]  They're killing themselves.
[02:27:46.655 --> 02:27:49.116]  The NFL, 40% less viewers than three years ago.
[02:27:49.496 --> 02:27:55.320]  So the good news is America and the world's turning against it, but they can't stop because it's their total agenda.
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:01.784]  And it'd be like if I turned into TV and like they were trying to teach my five-year-old about heterosexual sex, I'd say you're a pedophile.
[02:28:02.184 --> 02:28:05.586]  But because it's LBGTP, it's supposedly okay.
[02:28:05.626 --> 02:28:06.866]  So we're gonna break all this down.
[02:28:07.167 --> 02:28:08.768]  The new book is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:28:10.219 --> 02:28:11.140]  Needs to be a bestseller.
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:13.222]  In fact, I know it was the number one political book.
[02:28:13.262 --> 02:28:14.342]  What did it go to on Amazon?
[02:28:14.383 --> 02:28:14.763]  Liberalism?
[02:28:14.863 --> 02:28:15.283]  Findacure?
[02:28:15.303 --> 02:28:15.523]  Mark?
[02:28:16.384 --> 02:28:20.628]  It was number 15 on Amazon.com out of all books.
[02:28:20.708 --> 02:28:22.329]  Not just a specific category.
[02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:23.510]  The day that it came out.
[02:28:23.530 --> 02:28:24.211]  Unprecedented.
[02:28:24.291 --> 02:28:30.136]  Interestingly, the same ceiling that my last book, The True Story of Fake News, hit as well.
[02:28:30.396 --> 02:28:32.097]  And that's with no reviews.
[02:28:32.698 --> 02:28:32.918]  I did
[02:28:33.098 --> 02:28:34.198]  Oh, it's like the stock market.
[02:28:34.258 --> 02:28:35.839]  It's got all these pre-placed computer deals.
[02:28:36.139 --> 02:28:37.519]  The point is, everybody should get the book.
[02:28:37.559 --> 02:28:38.679]  Great job, people that did.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:39.980]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:40.800]  Liberalism.
[02:28:40.840 --> 02:28:41.400]  Find a cure.
[02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:45.501]  Give it to members of your family that are on the fence and say, listen, it may not be too late for you.
[02:28:45.521 --> 02:28:47.042]  Do you really want to be part of this?
[02:28:47.062 --> 02:28:48.562]  At Infowarsstore.com.
[02:28:48.842 --> 02:28:53.483]  We'll be right back with Mark Dice and a special message from Tim Cook on the other side.
[02:28:54.003 --> 02:28:54.904]  Newswars.com.
[02:28:55.184 --> 02:28:55.904]  Infowars.com.
[02:28:55.944 --> 02:28:57.864]  Without you spreading the links, they'll win.
[02:28:58.184 --> 02:28:59.085]  You spread them, we win.
[02:28:59.105 --> 02:28:59.605]  Stay with us.
[02:29:09.097 --> 02:29:12.018]  What do you want to do with your life?
[02:29:12.738 --> 02:29:13.579]  I want to rock!
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:21.161]  When this baby hits 88 miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious s***.
[02:29:21.681 --> 02:29:29.284]  You know, someone very profoundly once said, many years ago, that if fascism ever comes to America, it'll come in the name of liberalism.
[02:29:30.044 --> 02:29:31.245]  Shots fired.
[02:29:33.666 --> 02:29:38.087]  Those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws.
[02:29:39.247 --> 02:29:41.528]  I happen to know this from personal experience.
[02:29:41.748 --> 02:29:43.308]  I could end this guy, Jack, tomorrow.
[02:29:43.428 --> 02:29:45.829]  All you gotta do is arm all your pests.
[02:29:46.109 --> 02:29:54.490]  I don't think that you should look back and whine and bellyache or try to hold somebody else guilty for everything you did.
[02:29:54.610 --> 02:29:55.271]  Where's the beat?
[02:29:55.631 --> 02:29:57.331]  Alright, what is the trilateral to me?
[02:29:58.697 --> 02:30:01.578]  An organization founded in 1973 by David Rockefeller.
[02:30:01.678 --> 02:30:10.102]  You see, what they're really up to is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this country.
[02:30:10.442 --> 02:30:15.624]  To work to erase national boundaries and create an international community.
[02:30:16.125 --> 02:30:21.267]  And, in time, bring about a one world government with David Rockefeller calling the shots!
[02:30:22.602 --> 02:30:39.372]  As Oliver North's public battle over government secrets and the illegal supply of weapons to the Nicaraguan Contras is waged in Washington, Congressional investigators in recent months have tried to learn if Mena, Arkansas was an illegal staging area for shipping guns to the U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
[02:30:39.632 --> 02:30:46.216]  It all begins in 1982, when this man, Adler Berryman Seal, showed up in Mena, Arkansas.
[02:30:46.556 --> 02:30:47.697]  He used to smuggle drugs.
[02:30:47.937 --> 02:30:52.560]  Then he got caught and he became one of the government's most valuable informants in the war against cocaine.
[02:30:52.700 --> 02:30:57.323]  But last night in Louisiana, Barry Seale's enemies caught up with him and killed him.
[02:30:58.654 --> 02:31:02.897]  17-year-old Kevin Ives and 16-year-old Don Henry were struck by a train.
[02:31:03.197 --> 02:31:07.360]  The medical examiner has said that the boys were asleep and drugged with marijuana.
[02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:10.222]  The parents, however, disputed that claim.
[02:31:10.282 --> 02:31:17.767]  The boys were killed because they had stumbled upon a large shipment of drugs dropped from an airplane.
[02:31:18.087 --> 02:31:22.410]  Tears in the fabric indicate that Don had been stabbed before he was run over by the train.
[02:31:22.730 --> 02:31:28.034]  In light of this new evidence, the grand jury changed this ruling from probable homicide to definite homicide.
[02:31:29.095 --> 02:31:30.255]  I'm scared of these people.
[02:31:30.976 --> 02:31:33.297]  I'm very scared of them.
[02:31:33.458 --> 02:31:40.402]  How do you think the crack crowd fits into the country?
[02:31:40.422 --> 02:31:41.823]  We don't own any planes.
[02:31:42.284 --> 02:31:43.384]  We don't own no ships.
[02:31:43.625 --> 02:31:46.967]  We are not the people who are flying and floating that shit in here.
[02:31:47.227 --> 02:31:53.892]  I will tell you, Director Deutsch, as a former Los Angeles police narcotics detective, that the agency has dealt drugs throughout this country for a long time.
[02:31:56.233 --> 02:32:03.640]  Men who are working for the CIA's army were responsible for bringing all that cocaine into Los Angeles that sparked the crack epidemic.
[02:32:03.660 --> 02:32:08.464]  My boss goes on a fishing trip with George Bush and when they come back they say the ends justify the means.
[02:32:08.484 --> 02:32:15.570]  Sir, the Republicans are trying to blame you for the existence of a small air base at Mena, Arkansas.
[02:32:16.011 --> 02:32:22.837]  This base was set up by George Bush and Oliver North and the CIA to help the Iran-controvers
[02:32:23.377 --> 02:32:28.579]  And they brought in plane load after plane load of cocaine there for sale in the United States.
[02:32:29.379 --> 02:32:35.280]  And then they took the money and bought weapons and took them back to the Congress, all of which was illegal, as you know, under the Bowling Act.
[02:32:35.861 --> 02:32:40.882]  But tell me, did they tell you that this had to be in existence because of national security?
[02:32:41.082 --> 02:32:44.263]  We had nothing, zero, to do with it.
[02:32:44.783 --> 02:32:47.504]  And everybody who's ever looked into it knows that.
[02:32:48.144 --> 02:32:52.406]  I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
[02:32:52.466 --> 02:32:52.747]  Lewinsky.
[02:32:53.287 --> 02:32:55.228]  These allegations are false.
[02:32:56.288 --> 02:33:02.071]  If you are assuming this transmission, you are in existence.
[02:33:06.253 --> 02:33:08.875]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.340 --> 02:33:15.802]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:33:15.822 --> 02:33:17.063]  I'm too weak.
[02:33:17.183 --> 02:33:18.264]  Oh, don't kill me.
[02:33:18.444 --> 02:33:18.684]  Please.
[02:33:18.704 --> 02:33:30.533]  At Apple, we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on the challenge.
[02:33:31.534 --> 02:33:34.376]  That's why we can only have one message.
[02:33:41.331 --> 02:33:42.792]  We have no home here.
[02:33:43.553 --> 02:33:49.218]  And Apple, we are not afraid to say that our values drive our curation.
[02:33:49.238 --> 02:33:52.120]  The secrets of the universe, it's all there!
[02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:54.482]  You have no place on our platform.
[02:33:54.583 --> 02:33:56.985]  Life is fiery with its beauty!
[02:33:57.605 --> 02:34:01.508]  You have no place- Unlock your human control!
[02:34:01.549 --> 02:34:02.770]  You have no home here.
[02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:04.411]  Defeat the globalist who wants to-
[02:34:06.750 --> 02:34:11.159]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:34:36.787 --> 02:34:39.288]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[02:34:46.252 --> 02:34:57.918]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:34:58.079 --> 02:35:03.321]  I'm gonna say something here, reintroducing Mark Dice, wrestling author here on air.
[02:35:03.361 --> 02:35:03.942]  Leave all hurt.
[02:35:04.892 --> 02:35:09.795]  But we're not talking to the general listener that's smarter than I am in many cases, on different topics.
[02:35:09.815 --> 02:35:14.137]  We're all smarter than each other on some topics, like our own personal lives.
[02:35:14.997 --> 02:35:23.162]  But when it comes to different areas, like being a diesel mechanic, or being a brain surgeon, or being a school teacher, you're probably smarter than I am.
[02:35:23.182 --> 02:35:25.843]  But when it comes to studying geopolitics, I'm pretty damn smart.
[02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:31.986]  Because I've done some real studying, and then looked at history and seen what's accurate and what isn't.
[02:35:32.246 --> 02:35:33.347]  And here's the big announcement.
[02:35:35.782 --> 02:35:58.388]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, and different political systems, but because I've studied so much history, and I've studied so many white papers from the real establishment, that we really knew what their program was for world government, the attack on the family, and the transgender movement, and the open borders, and the radical Islam invasion, and the caliphate, and it sounded crazy!
[02:35:58.408 --> 02:36:00.169]  Because why would you wreck something good?
[02:36:02.125 --> 02:36:15.454]  They fundamentally want to control everything, and women and men together, with children and futures, who are actually egalitarian and classically liberal and open, that creates so much wealth and power that you can't have an authoritarian system.
[02:36:16.455 --> 02:36:23.339]  So they use our classical liberalism with leftist evil, which means Luciferian, left at bat, against us.
[02:36:24.160 --> 02:36:27.342]  The only thing similar between leftist and liberal is the L. Nothing else.
[02:36:29.073 --> 02:36:30.474]  World government's out in the open.
[02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:32.196]  Global carbon tax is out in the open.
[02:36:32.216 --> 02:36:33.857]  The attack on the family's out in the open.
[02:36:34.818 --> 02:36:35.959]  Mark Dice, what is it like?
[02:36:35.979 --> 02:36:37.941]  Because you've written, I don't know, 20-something books, I forget.
[02:36:37.961 --> 02:36:41.944]  You've republished famous books, written 200 years ago on the subject.
[02:36:43.726 --> 02:36:48.730]  When I saw Americana and free market and the Renaissance and everything, I knew that was reality.
[02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:50.832]  I knew the globalists were fighting that, so I thought,
[02:36:52.458 --> 02:37:08.864]  If we promote already the most powerful, successful, pro-human thing that ever existed, I believe once globalism fully emerges with all its tyranny and all its oppression and all of its forced austerity, that people will want the 1776, not the 1984.
[02:37:08.904 --> 02:37:10.464]  We've proven that's true all over the world.
[02:37:10.744 --> 02:37:11.805]  So here's the juxtapose.
[02:37:11.825 --> 02:37:18.007]  What is it like, because you've been involved politically and we've known each other like 16 years, you've been involved like 18 years, we're getting old here.
[02:37:19.173 --> 02:37:22.635]  You're going to college, you know, for your degree in media analysis then.
[02:37:23.135 --> 02:37:26.717]  What is it like to, A, be right, but then to be attacked more than ever?
[02:37:27.538 --> 02:37:35.562]  And then what do you think comes out of this, with nationalists winning everywhere and populists winning, but the globalists still have the money and the media pressing the attack?
[02:37:35.662 --> 02:37:36.863]  It's so explosive!
[02:37:37.103 --> 02:37:38.184]  What would you call this time?
[02:37:39.702 --> 02:37:41.443]  It's the most exciting time of my life.
[02:37:41.523 --> 02:37:47.947]  It's one of the most critical points in world history for freedom because we've seen their plans, you've seen their plans.
[02:37:47.987 --> 02:37:58.492]  In 2010, I wrote a book titled The New World or Facts and Fiction and a lot of the stuff that we're talking about and we're experiencing now was sort of on the forefront or coming in the future.
[02:37:58.812 --> 02:38:01.534]  Things that the globalists were planning.
[02:38:01.554 --> 02:38:04.215]  It was on the horizon and now it's run us over.
[02:38:04.856 --> 02:38:06.837]  Now it's here and it's not just here.
[02:38:06.917 --> 02:38:08.898]  I mean we're in the middle of it and
[02:38:09.645 --> 02:38:16.087]  There's a lot more people who support us than our vocal online, because a lot of people just don't want to get involved with social media.
[02:38:16.127 --> 02:38:18.908]  They don't want to have their tweets from 10 years ago come back to haunt them.
[02:38:19.268 --> 02:38:20.829]  They don't want to be glued to their phone.
[02:38:21.169 --> 02:38:25.330]  They don't want to be stuck in that digital gulag.
[02:38:25.450 --> 02:38:31.452]  So they're talking at the dinner table, they're talking at the water cooler, they're supporting what it is that we're doing.
[02:38:31.472 --> 02:38:38.955]  But it's very scary to see Tim Cook, the CEO of the most powerful, wealthy corporation ever in the history of the planet,
[02:38:39.635 --> 02:38:47.899]  Saying that if somebody is just divisive now, that you have no place on their platform, a guy who... And you can divide... They're talking about me.
[02:38:48.199 --> 02:38:54.362]  They're saying anyone that divides us from the big mothership's orders is gone.
[02:38:55.325 --> 02:39:01.371]  Now he was accepting an award for, you know, fighting hatred from the ADL, which is what that clip was that you played.
[02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:08.419]  And the ADL also is calling for the elimination of celebration of Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[02:39:08.779 --> 02:39:15.707]  So it's sort of more from an organization that was fighting anti-Semitism to this social justice warrior.
[02:39:16.327 --> 02:39:17.890]  They're for drag time tots.
[02:39:18.251 --> 02:39:22.859]  If you don't want your two-year-old being taught they're really another sex, the ADL says you're a Nazi.
[02:39:22.879 --> 02:39:24.121]  Well then screw you, man!
[02:39:24.161 --> 02:39:25.824]  What a cult of evil!
[02:39:27.185 --> 02:39:41.895]  They have their guide, guide for schools on their website, where they say that they recommend public schools to not celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day anymore because that's divisive, not using the terms to all of the... I mean, what a cult!
[02:39:42.035 --> 02:39:47.599]  Mother and Father, the flag's bad, schools everywhere banning Christmas, now they're banning red and green.
[02:39:47.919 --> 02:39:53.162]  This is just a cult saying, we control all knowledge, you come to us to decide what language you can use.
[02:39:53.403 --> 02:39:55.284]  What an incredible group of authoritarians!
[02:39:55.484 --> 02:39:56.945]  What a group of monsters, Mark!
[02:39:57.846 --> 02:40:10.277]  And, you know, some of the great thinkers in the past have put these ideas and warnings into science fiction, like George Orwell in 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451.
[02:40:10.677 --> 02:40:15.061]  And these people like Tim Cook are actually worse than the party in Big Brother.
[02:40:15.101 --> 02:40:19.606]  And Orwell warned us in 1984, which was published, what, like 60 years ago?
[02:40:20.366 --> 02:40:23.447]  That the government wanted to break up the family.
[02:40:23.467 --> 02:40:26.048]  This is in the book, obviously, which is Paralleling Reality.
[02:40:26.088 --> 02:40:28.409]  Oh, he was a high-level Fabian socialist communist.
[02:40:29.370 --> 02:40:31.731]  The character, Winston Smith, he wrote a non-fiction book.
[02:40:32.291 --> 02:40:33.431]  He wrote the book, it was out a year later.
[02:40:33.451 --> 02:40:36.253]  He wrote it in 47, it came out in 48.
[02:40:36.513 --> 02:40:40.194]  He believed in the ideas of communism and power people, and he was high-level.
[02:40:40.234 --> 02:40:44.316]  When they said, no, we're just going to destroy everything for evil's sake, he flipped out.
[02:40:45.384 --> 02:41:05.302]  Well, there's a line in 1984 where Winston is amusing a lot about how the government is breaking up the family so that nobody has allegiance to each other or to any centralized authority or any governing body or any group that's going to instill morality and to have a support structure.
[02:41:05.342 --> 02:41:06.604]  Well, just a sense of being.
[02:41:06.664 --> 02:41:07.825]  They don't want any past.
[02:41:07.845 --> 02:41:09.106]  They're at war with history.
[02:41:09.346 --> 02:41:11.128]  They're at war with you having any roots.
[02:41:12.239 --> 02:41:15.220]  So that people, of course, will look to the government as God.
[02:41:15.240 --> 02:41:16.740]  The government replaces God.
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:34.603]  And the military-industrial complex is a police arm of that, but the Hollywood industrial complex is an extension of that power, because they're the ones which shape the culture, which Andrew Breitbart so cleverly said, the politics is downstream from the culture.
[02:41:34.663 --> 02:41:37.544]  And so Hollywood propaganda-entertainment complex
[02:41:38.224 --> 02:41:46.490]  Is constantly poisoning the minds of the masses, of the kids, every award show, every major television series.
[02:41:46.530 --> 02:41:50.372]  No, I agree, but there's a major breaking from it, so they've intensified it.
[02:41:50.412 --> 02:41:51.333]  How do you see that going?
[02:41:53.115 --> 02:42:03.465]  They're losing their audience, but unfortunately, the audience is fragmenting, and so they're co-opting a lot of YouTube channels now, they're co-opting a lot of alternative, independent websites.
[02:42:03.486 --> 02:42:04.827]  We are seeing them fail.
[02:42:05.247 --> 02:42:09.071]  We're seeing a lot of the so-called new media sites on the internet, like, might fail.
[02:42:09.091 --> 02:42:12.675]  Oh, I've seen, like, top podcasters that I know have literally joined Darth Vader.
[02:42:13.155 --> 02:42:14.917]  They've just, they've just, they've literally joined it.
[02:42:15.768 --> 02:42:19.891]  BuzzFeed is literally asking for donations now, on the bottom of their article.
[02:42:19.911 --> 02:42:20.951]  That's my next question.
[02:42:21.031 --> 02:42:22.532]  My God, you're always on target.
[02:42:22.833 --> 02:42:24.474]  Mark Dice, we didn't pre-talk about this.
[02:42:24.534 --> 02:42:25.494]  I wanted to next hit.
[02:42:26.055 --> 02:42:37.162]  BuzzFeed, Weekly Standard, all the neocont leftist groups are far beyond bankrupt and now their big banker owners aren't financing them because we've all been censored off the web, they say.
[02:42:37.422 --> 02:42:38.863]  So why are you even needed?
[02:42:39.223 --> 02:42:40.024]  What idiots?
[02:42:40.464 --> 02:42:42.966]  We'll talk about that with Mark Dice and what's coming next.
[02:42:43.006 --> 02:42:46.449]  His book, already a bestseller, number 15 on Amazon total.
[02:42:46.749 --> 02:42:48.110]  Get it at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:42:48.170 --> 02:42:49.231]  Liberalism, find a cure.
[02:42:49.592 --> 02:42:50.833]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:42:51.053 --> 02:42:52.334]  Or get it at MarkDice.com.
[02:42:52.354 --> 02:42:54.015]  But support the originators.
[02:42:54.436 --> 02:42:56.537]  You can believe me, Amazon doesn't let Mark get $2 a book.
[02:43:12.924 --> 02:43:14.345]  We're here because you've stood with us.
[02:43:15.867 --> 02:43:17.689]  And it's been amazing.
[02:43:17.809 --> 02:43:20.932]  And because of what you've done as an audience, we've changed the world.
[02:43:21.052 --> 02:43:26.036]  We fundamentally expose globalism as this planetary world government authoritarian system.
[02:43:26.176 --> 02:43:27.297]  And so they denied it existed.
[02:43:27.398 --> 02:43:32.122]  But now they're out in the open admitting it exists because they were unsuccessful in stopping a debate about it.
[02:43:32.182 --> 02:43:39.289]  So now they've just moved directly to total censorship of any nationalist, of any Christian, of any conservative that exposes the scam that they're involved in.
[02:43:39.429 --> 02:43:49.839]  There's a clip up on DrudgeReport.com where Alexander Cortez says it's inevitable that global warming governance, a global governance of global warming, dragging everything you do, will create economic, social and
[02:43:51.461 --> 02:44:02.416]  We can use the transition to 100% renewable energy as the vehicle to truly deliver and establish economic, social, and racial justice in the United States of America.
[02:44:03.197 --> 02:44:06.902]  That is our proposal, and that is what we are here to do.
[02:44:07.363 --> 02:44:12.527]  So that's these big carbon exchanges owned by Al Gore and Laura Rothschild and Barack Obama.
[02:44:12.567 --> 02:44:13.808]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:44:13.848 --> 02:44:17.151]  Being paid by everybody that engages in any human activity.
[02:44:17.331 --> 02:44:18.031]  Everything's taxed.
[02:44:18.191 --> 02:44:18.472]  Everything.
[02:44:18.572 --> 02:44:19.552]  Being born is taxed.
[02:44:19.692 --> 02:44:29.140]  And you pay this new superclass of Bernie Sanders types to fly around on their private jets while they tell you they're saving the earth and saving the atmosphere with all these taxes.
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:36.846]  While they're carrying out geoengineering operations that actually could collapse the atmosphere, all the scientists that have looked at it say.
[02:44:37.006 --> 02:44:38.287]  So, they're collapsing it.
[02:44:38.387 --> 02:44:42.370]  They're going to bring the taxes in and then later say, oh, we acted too little too late.
[02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:44.412]  You can see the whole diabolical plan.
[02:44:44.512 --> 02:44:47.714]  Mike Adams has written a masterstroke report that everyone should read.
[02:44:47.835 --> 02:44:50.076]  It's at naturalnews.com and infowars.com.
[02:44:50.216 --> 02:44:51.798]  Terraforming has begun.
[02:44:51.818 --> 02:44:55.981]  Global dimming is a plot to exterminate humanity by terraforming the atmosphere.
[02:44:57.342 --> 02:45:03.689]  This is reality, and I'm begging you to get the report and get out to everyone you know.
[02:45:03.849 --> 02:45:09.154]  That said, it is your purchase of the products at InfoWareStore.com that make all this possible.

[02:45:46.789 --> 02:45:50.912]  Possible the 12 days of Christmas are running through right up until the 19th.

[02:45:52.614 --> 02:45:53.735]  Without you, we'll be shut down.
[02:46:05.905 --> 02:46:15.207]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[02:46:15.647 --> 02:46:26.690]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our Immune Support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[02:46:27.370 --> 02:46:33.493]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee bean.
[02:46:33.533 --> 02:46:45.160]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need in the morning.

[02:47:06.135 --> 02:47:08.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:21.219 --> 02:47:35.704]  You know, it's not just in the BBC or Salon or the New York Times saying, stations are reviewing many Christmas songs and banning them like jingle bells.
[02:47:36.465 --> 02:47:38.205]  And, hey baby, it's cold outside.
[02:47:39.246 --> 02:47:41.766]  No, they're banning dozens of songs.
[02:47:41.806 --> 02:47:42.267]  They're evil.
[02:47:42.507 --> 02:47:45.908]  Everything must be projected on and made evil by the Thought Police.
[02:47:47.125 --> 02:47:55.487]  And if they can take good old-fashioned Christian Christmas music and get rid of it, well, that's another big victory for the Thought Police, because then, won't what you put up with it.
[02:47:55.527 --> 02:47:57.467]  Oh, by the way, we're going to sexualize your five-year-old.
[02:47:57.868 --> 02:47:59.528]  We've got grown men dressed like women.
[02:47:59.548 --> 02:48:08.850]  Normally, they've got to get in ice cream trucks and offer candy and have a puppy to kidnap your kid, but now they're making grooming first contact, and it's no big deal.
[02:48:08.890 --> 02:48:11.131]  And they admit they are, so get used to it!
[02:48:11.211 --> 02:48:13.451]  Because you roll over, so you deserve it!
[02:48:14.011 --> 02:48:16.332]  Because big tech will come after your ass if you don't submit!
[02:48:17.423 --> 02:48:19.304]  Believe me, Tim Cook owns Slave Factors in China.
[02:48:19.324 --> 02:48:20.124]  He means business!
[02:48:21.425 --> 02:48:25.667]  So, I want to make this huge point, because Mark just alluded to it.
[02:48:25.687 --> 02:48:27.948]  Mark Dice, media commentator, best-selling author.
[02:48:29.229 --> 02:48:29.729]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:48:29.749 --> 02:48:31.570]  You've just joined us here on RadioRTV.
[02:48:34.532 --> 02:48:35.392]  We know how this works.
[02:48:35.492 --> 02:48:46.858]  We know that with the Nazis or the Communists in Russia, or in the time of Rome, in every culture, the traitorous group that helps overthrow the good system,
[02:48:48.069 --> 02:48:50.630]  He's really looked down upon by those that are taking over.
[02:48:51.850 --> 02:49:02.072]  So the weird little traitors that were dishonorable, they're always long-knifed after the real establishment gets into power, like Enst, Rome, and the SA, or Hitler's brown shirts.
[02:49:03.572 --> 02:49:06.853]  And so the BuzzFeeds and the salons follow the orders, man.
[02:49:06.873 --> 02:49:07.353]  You'd see it.
[02:49:07.453 --> 02:49:09.314]  Pedophilia is good all the same day.
[02:49:09.734 --> 02:49:10.414]  Families are bad.
[02:49:13.379 --> 02:49:17.561]  And so they would come out and lie about us, and put out outrageous lies, all in unison, hundreds of publications.
[02:49:18.182 --> 02:49:22.264]  And now that the big censorship happened, and the deplatforming of InfoWars and NewsWars.
[02:49:23.644 --> 02:49:25.285]  But wait, we're still here though.
[02:49:25.365 --> 02:49:26.966]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:49:27.026 --> 02:49:29.387]  Our reach has been diminished, but our core audience is bigger than ever.
[02:49:29.768 --> 02:49:31.128]  But see, they didn't really have a core audience.
[02:49:31.148 --> 02:49:39.993]  They were just there to put up the talking point, to create the illusion for corporations to think they had pressure on them to remove us, to set the precedent to remove everybody.
[02:49:41.806 --> 02:49:43.107]  And so now it's all over the news.
[02:49:43.787 --> 02:49:44.007]  Why?
[02:49:44.047 --> 02:49:45.328]  The digital bubble's broken.
[02:49:45.348 --> 02:49:46.949]  We put these articles on screen.
[02:49:47.689 --> 02:49:48.630]  Everybody's for sale.
[02:49:49.470 --> 02:49:50.631]  They're all going bankrupt.
[02:49:50.671 --> 02:49:52.832]  The Weekly Standard, the neocon group's shutting down.
[02:49:53.432 --> 02:50:02.857]  All of it because now George Soros doesn't need to spend two or three billion dollars like he did in the last cycle on that because he thinks he's shut everybody down.
[02:50:03.317 --> 02:50:06.139]  Oh, and now you're not needed anymore.
[02:50:06.539 --> 02:50:17.229]  What fools, you know, even a sociopath that was long-term smart would think, you know, I exist as a leftist anti-American traitor because there's Alex Joneses out there fighting me for the Republic.
[02:50:17.669 --> 02:50:19.311]  You know, you think you're really Machiavelli, you're not.
[02:50:19.411 --> 02:50:20.952]  I don't do it from a Machiavellian perspective.
[02:50:21.232 --> 02:50:23.755]  Do you think I'm mentally ill, that I have a conscience, I tell the truth?
[02:50:23.815 --> 02:50:24.015]  No.
[02:50:24.735 --> 02:50:26.197]  We build civilization, you destroy it.
[02:50:26.217 --> 02:50:30.301]  But let me explain to you little sociopaths something, though you're not inventive enough or smart enough to even get it.
[02:50:31.341 --> 02:50:32.823]  If you really want to be sociopathic,
[02:50:34.246 --> 02:50:35.207]  Really smart long-term.
[02:50:35.247 --> 02:50:39.732]  See, you wouldn't fight too hard and totally take out InfoWars because you'd want opposition.
[02:50:40.133 --> 02:50:44.297]  Once the opposition's gone with authoritarians, they have no respect for anybody, especially you.
[02:50:44.597 --> 02:50:45.599]  They remove you.
[02:50:46.680 --> 02:50:47.741]  Globalists respect me.
[02:50:47.821 --> 02:50:48.822]  They do not respect you.
[02:50:50.544 --> 02:50:52.266]  Because you don't have a soul, in their view.
[02:50:53.755 --> 02:50:59.440]  And so now thousands of digital sites that were front groups of the Democrats are all going bankrupt.
[02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:04.084]  They're doing monthly layoffs of 20% so then just a few months they're all they're gone.
[02:51:04.765 --> 02:51:09.649]  But to save face they'll leave one person there to you know kind of put up a few articles because they don't need you now.
[02:51:09.969 --> 02:51:11.250]  They write one press release.
[02:51:12.171 --> 02:51:14.413]  It's been rewritten everywhere and republished.
[02:51:15.615 --> 02:51:22.682]  And so you've just extincted all of yourselves by blowing up the free society, you morons!
[02:51:23.403 --> 02:51:24.844]  Mark, that's really incredible, isn't it?
[02:51:24.864 --> 02:51:26.506]  You talk about sticking your foot in your mouth.
[02:51:30.029 --> 02:51:36.035]  A social networking site called Tumblr, which is sort of like Instagram for the insane, and thankfully they have their own
[02:51:37.688 --> 02:51:38.108]  We're good to go.
[02:52:05.593 --> 02:52:07.074]  Now virtually unknown.
[02:52:07.094 --> 02:52:10.136]  Probably be completely shut down within the next 12 months.
[02:52:10.677 --> 02:52:11.057]  Gone.
[02:52:11.317 --> 02:52:14.980]  When's the last time anybody used Netscape to log on to the internet?
[02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:16.381]  Or America Online?
[02:52:16.681 --> 02:52:19.143]  So these once giants can fall.
[02:52:19.223 --> 02:52:24.466]  So Facebook, Apple, Twitter, all of these places can come crumbling down.
[02:52:24.767 --> 02:52:29.110]  And we have to remain vigilant to keep pushing back on them because they're not going to stop.
[02:52:29.350 --> 02:52:33.733]  And it's hilarious we have to keep pointing out their flaws because Jack Dorsey was just over in India.
[02:52:34.711 --> 02:52:42.593]  And he showed a photo of somebody that, or a painting that somebody made for him that perpetuated the caste system.
[02:52:43.013 --> 02:52:53.436]  And so the lower level people of society over there in the caste started criticizing Jack Dorsey for endorsing the social stratification separate system over there.
[02:52:53.516 --> 02:52:58.417]  So he can't even win by going over there and trying to suck up to the people in India.
[02:52:59.017 --> 02:52:59.937]  And we've got to push back.
[02:52:59.957 --> 02:53:04.799]  You know, every time Jack Dorsey tweets something on Twitter, go follow him and respond to everything that he says.
[02:53:05.139 --> 02:53:17.622]  Fill his timeline filled with a bunch of questions and comments about what it is that he's doing because they are worse than Big River in 1984 because with the push of a button they can make you disappear.
[02:53:17.882 --> 02:53:19.883]  But it's great to see so many people waking up.
[02:53:20.223 --> 02:53:22.525]  And I was relieved to see that Donald Trump Jr.
[02:53:22.965 --> 02:53:30.609]  responded to the controversy about Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer last week by saying that, quote, liberalism is a disease.
[02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:36.893]  And I know some people get into the weeds about, well, that liberalism doesn't mean what people say it is.
[02:53:36.913 --> 02:53:39.235]  And I would think at this point the word is almost tainted.
[02:53:39.255 --> 02:53:39.615]  No, you're right.
[02:53:39.635 --> 02:53:40.375]  They've taken it over.
[02:53:40.435 --> 02:53:41.836]  Liberalism is now leftism.
[02:53:41.856 --> 02:53:47.820]  It means an authoritarian control freak who's mentally ill and brain scans is a genetic psychopath.
[02:53:49.426 --> 02:53:54.328]  Yeah, and we're seeing major companies like BuzzFeed literally asking for donations.
[02:53:54.548 --> 02:53:57.669]  The London Guardian is asking for donations.
[02:53:57.729 --> 02:54:01.190]  The Weekly Standard is potentially going bankrupt.
[02:54:01.230 --> 02:54:05.512]  The Daily Beast, an extension of Newsweek magazine, they're for sale.
[02:54:05.872 --> 02:54:18.477]  And we've even seen the phony patriots on the right, like Glenn Beck, who in 2011 started his new independent media empire when he left Fox News, which should be rivaling Fox News by now, but he's a complete phony.
[02:54:19.392 --> 02:54:22.033]  Most of your audience knows this, but now he has merged.
[02:54:22.073 --> 02:54:32.695]  He's found a new host to suck the blood out of, as The Blaze has merged with CRTV, which was doing very well in the online environment.
[02:54:32.755 --> 02:54:36.116]  Got a good subscriber base, some great hosts, good content.
[02:54:36.216 --> 02:54:37.696]  Eric Bolling is over there.
[02:54:37.896 --> 02:54:39.437]  Michelle Malkin was over there.
[02:54:39.757 --> 02:54:44.538]  Now she quit as soon as they announced the merger, because Glenn Beck
[02:54:45.134 --> 02:54:47.696]  He's trying to suck the blood as the parent that he is.
[02:54:47.716 --> 02:54:50.678]  I was about to say, Glenn Beck is a dyed-in-the-wool leftist.
[02:54:51.359 --> 02:54:53.621]  Glenn Beck told a lot of truth at Fox.
[02:54:53.961 --> 02:54:56.463]  He only did it to get the audience, then tried to parlay it.
[02:54:56.923 --> 02:54:58.485]  And they tried to sell us BlazeTV.
[02:55:00.510 --> 02:55:01.130]  It was for sale.
[02:55:01.470 --> 02:55:02.470]  They didn't sell.
[02:55:02.911 --> 02:55:03.691]  They didn't merge.
[02:55:03.731 --> 02:55:05.951]  They collapsed into CRTV.
[02:55:06.831 --> 02:55:09.592]  And I guess because CRTV wants its hundreds of radio affiliates.
[02:55:10.452 --> 02:55:11.952]  But that is just a disaster.
[02:55:11.992 --> 02:55:13.192]  And I like CRTV.
[02:55:13.653 --> 02:55:18.613]  And let me tell you, Beck will always try to use his political power once he gets into a group.
[02:55:18.673 --> 02:55:20.394]  He's all about controlling things.
[02:55:20.834 --> 02:55:22.194]  He's all about dirty tricks.
[02:55:22.634 --> 02:55:25.075]  You know, he got threatened with what happened to us six, seven years ago.
[02:55:25.115 --> 02:55:26.035]  They said, we're going to come after you.
[02:55:26.055 --> 02:55:26.715]  We're going to sue you.
[02:55:27.315 --> 02:55:28.275]  We're going to de-platform him.
[02:55:28.315 --> 02:55:32.797]  He just rolled over and thought he'd go be a darling of the left, but then they rejected him as well.
[02:55:33.817 --> 02:55:41.760]  So now, even though most of the folks on CRTV were anti-Trump, which that's fine, like Levin and the rest of them, now they're all pro-Trump, which is fine.
[02:55:42.160 --> 02:55:42.740]  We were here.
[02:55:42.880 --> 02:55:43.580]  We took the heat.
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:45.821]  We've been targeted because we were steadfast.
[02:55:45.861 --> 02:55:46.561]  Mark, I know you got to go.
[02:55:46.581 --> 02:55:46.982]  We're going to break.
[02:55:47.002 --> 02:55:50.283]  We'll do five more minutes with you, and then we're going to have Nick Baggage come in and take over.
[02:55:50.303 --> 02:55:51.123]  But let me just say this briefly.
[02:55:52.515 --> 02:55:53.595]  Everyone needs to get the book.
[02:55:53.675 --> 02:55:54.516]  I don't care where you get it.
[02:55:54.556 --> 02:55:55.636]  Liberalism, find a cure.
[02:55:55.676 --> 02:55:56.336]  You need to read it.
[02:55:56.416 --> 02:56:00.418]  But most of you, as patriots, as conservatives, as libertarians, you already know all this.
[02:56:02.779 --> 02:56:06.460]  You really, really need to get the book and give it to everyone you know.
[02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:09.321]  Because Mark Dice isn't funded by the globalists.
[02:56:09.941 --> 02:56:11.022]  I'm not funded by the globalists.
[02:56:11.222 --> 02:56:11.842]  And separately.
[02:56:13.285 --> 02:56:15.666]  George Soros, as we speak, has pulled out the stops.
[02:56:15.786 --> 02:56:28.810]  I learned more stuff the last week that I haven't gotten into on air, about just as we defeat his last wave of stuff at great expense, they launch even more treacherous activity, and just financing really makes it easier for us to fight.
[02:56:29.270 --> 02:56:39.053]  It's all in God's hands, but InfoWarsTore.com has free shipping storewide, double Patriot points, but with whatever order you get on the next order, from 5% to 10% just until Christmas.
[02:56:39.493 --> 02:56:41.174]  Storewide free shipping, and we have 70
[02:56:43.917 --> 02:56:46.599]  5% is the biggest discount.
[02:56:46.779 --> 02:56:47.800]  75% is the biggest discount.
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:49.802]  But everything is bare minimum 50% discount.
[02:56:51.023 --> 02:56:52.924]  And that means Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver.
[02:56:52.984 --> 02:56:54.345]  That means Super Mel Vitality.
[02:56:54.365 --> 02:56:55.947]  That means X2, X3.
[02:56:56.647 --> 02:56:58.909]  That means Rainforest Plus.
[02:56:59.029 --> 02:57:03.052]  And every order, this is our biggest deal ever with just those prices.
[02:57:03.072 --> 02:57:05.894]  This is total clearance for the year, so we don't pay inventory tax.
[02:57:06.435 --> 02:57:10.018]  Every order gets a, we're all Alex Jones, don't tread on me, Gadsden flag.
[02:57:11.158 --> 02:57:11.979]  Limited edition shirt.
[02:57:12.339 --> 02:57:14.401]  But by Monday, this shirt will be sold out.
[02:57:14.801 --> 02:57:17.644]  We have another shirt that's excellent as well that'll be the free gift.
[02:57:18.245 --> 02:57:19.446]  You get your orders in by the 19th.
[02:57:19.506 --> 02:57:22.429]  They're guaranteed delivery before Christmas in the continental U.S.
[02:57:22.829 --> 02:57:23.950]  But get your orders in now.
[02:57:24.030 --> 02:57:24.871]  Don't fight traffic.
[02:57:25.291 --> 02:57:26.072]  Don't fight the malls.
[02:57:26.152 --> 02:57:27.393]  And fund the info war.
[02:57:27.994 --> 02:57:31.377]  And I want to see liberalism find a cure.
[02:57:31.497 --> 02:57:32.698]  We've only got like 500 copies.
[02:57:33.059 --> 02:57:33.779]  Sell out today!
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:36.500]  Looks like I went to number 15 on Amazon total.
[02:57:37.021 --> 02:57:38.701]  And I'm gonna order 10,000 of this, man.
[02:57:38.901 --> 02:57:40.961]  Everyone needs to know we're in a war.
[02:57:41.481 --> 02:57:44.742]  And we can get around the enemy as long as you take action.
[02:57:45.082 --> 02:57:48.943]  Whatever you do, tell folks about that local radio station you're listening to right now.
[02:57:49.363 --> 02:57:49.743]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.184 --> 02:57:58.645]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[02:58:00.356 --> 02:58:01.797]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[02:58:02.038 --> 02:58:07.002]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off double Patriot points.
[02:58:08.163 --> 02:58:14.089]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[02:58:14.849 --> 02:58:22.516]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[02:58:23.277 --> 02:58:49.449]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next group of orders so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[02:58:50.672 --> 02:58:56.995]  We are losing money on this, but we're gonna help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[02:58:57.455 --> 02:58:59.195]  Everybody says, Texas doesn't have income tax.
[02:58:59.275 --> 02:59:04.197]  I love my state, but if you got a business and a company here and you got merchandise, BS.
[02:59:04.658 --> 02:59:05.138]  It's big.
[02:59:05.698 --> 02:59:06.098]  It's bad.
[02:59:06.538 --> 02:59:11.760]  So we are clearing everything out so that we have the funds to go at least a few months into next year.
[02:59:11.780 --> 02:59:14.081]  You know, they've been trying to shut us down, but you've been supporting us.
[02:59:14.522 --> 02:59:17.723]  So to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the best deal ever.
[02:59:18.344 --> 02:59:19.287]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:59:19.327 --> 02:59:20.491]  That's been going on for over a month.
[02:59:20.511 --> 02:59:22.497]  50 to 75% off.
[02:59:22.517 --> 02:59:23.541]  That's been going on for a couple weeks.
[02:59:24.585 --> 02:59:25.525]  The Double Patriot points.
[02:59:25.545 --> 02:59:26.466]  That's what happened in about a week.
[02:59:26.826 --> 02:59:33.449]  Now, for the next 12 days of Christmas, every day a free gift on top of it and special mega-sales every day.
[02:59:33.909 --> 02:59:38.291]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:38.311 --> 02:59:40.192]  This is our biggest sale ever.
[02:59:40.452 --> 02:59:42.253]  Get your free gift, your free shipping, everything.
[02:59:42.453 --> 02:59:44.514]  And don't fight the crowds at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:59:44.674 --> 02:59:48.696]  And for myself and the InfoWars family, God bless you and thank you for your support.
[02:59:54.525 --> 02:59:58.638]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:59.140 --> 03:00:00.464]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:00:16.263 --> 03:00:22.271]  Alright folks, Mark Dice here with us and we were talking and I said, we're going to do five more minutes, what do you want to hit?
[03:00:22.371 --> 03:00:27.197]  And he said, Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act, it's in the new NAFTA deal Trump signed.
[03:00:28.066 --> 03:00:30.387]  Cutlow, you know, told him, hey, sign it, and Trump signs it.
[03:00:30.427 --> 03:00:38.112]  It's got a better deal for trade, but it allows the companies to continue to censor the right and actually codifies it into international law.
[03:00:38.132 --> 03:00:42.914]  Yeah, scroll down and I'll show them the new subsection right there.
[03:00:43.795 --> 03:00:46.856]  Section 230 can be amended by the U.S.
[03:00:47.056 --> 03:00:47.777]  and Congress.
[03:00:49.691 --> 03:00:59.669]  Now they've got a new subsection in the piece of international NAFTA legislation that allows them to engage in the mass censorship.
[03:01:02.461 --> 03:01:14.031]  Mark, let's speak to this and the fact that, you know, we joke and say, oh look, the Huffington Post called for Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer to be banned, and then within one day of it, your defense of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had been demonetized, and YouTube upheld that.
[03:01:14.111 --> 03:01:20.937]  That's how far we've gone that now Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the ADL will probably give YouTube an award for fighting this Nazi.
[03:01:22.079 --> 03:01:25.460]  Yeah, it's how poisoned the culture is and how infected it is with leftists.
[03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:28.341]  Most people are probably familiar with the controversy about Rudolph.
[03:01:28.381 --> 03:01:34.042]  The Huffington Post and a bunch of leftists said that it's sexist, homophobic, perpetuating gender norms.
[03:01:35.462 --> 03:01:41.644]  It shouldn't be bullying Rudolph, even though the whole point is that you can overcome adversity and a perceived flaw can actually be a benefit.
[03:01:41.684 --> 03:01:43.945]  I mean, a five-year-old understands the story.
[03:01:43.965 --> 03:01:45.625]  So I did a video about the madness.
[03:01:46.165 --> 03:01:50.126]  It was automatically demonetized by YouTube for whatever reason.
[03:01:50.186 --> 03:01:52.867]  Something that was said in the video was offensive.
[03:01:53.367 --> 03:02:03.550]  And so the way YouTube works is, a lot of people may know this by now, you have to submit the videos for a manual review, and then it takes a couple days, and then a parent watches them, so it doesn't even really matter if it gets monetized later anyway.
[03:02:03.610 --> 03:02:08.731]  But a manual review from a moderator demonetized the video and confirmed
[03:02:09.191 --> 03:02:14.638]  That the video was non-advertiser friendly, defending Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
[03:02:15.078 --> 03:02:17.581]  That's how affected the culture is with leftism.
[03:02:17.601 --> 03:02:20.745]  And I just saw an article, I thought it was fake news, I thought it was satire.
[03:02:20.765 --> 03:02:24.089]  I've seen multiple reports in it from respectable outlets.
[03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:33.539]  The school principal banned all mentions of Christmas and Jesus and including, and he put a list of things that teachers can't have in their classroom, candy canes.
[03:02:33.699 --> 03:02:42.990]  Candy canes, because he said that the candy cane represents the J in Jesus, which I've never heard, I've never seen a candy cane upside down.
[03:02:43.770 --> 03:02:51.276]  This is the religion of the left where like they think clouds are racist because it looks like the Irish name Lynch means hang black people.
[03:02:51.556 --> 03:02:53.237]  It's a total attack on reality.
[03:02:53.618 --> 03:02:54.718]  It's a total mental illness.
[03:02:54.758 --> 03:02:56.220]  It's like having schizophrenics run things.
[03:02:56.800 --> 03:02:59.622]  USMCA entrenches tech companies right to censor.
[03:03:00.403 --> 03:03:08.849]  They say anything found objectionable will be banned and they're given liability protection to do it in article 19.17 which is exactly what
[03:03:10.805 --> 03:03:17.278]  Days later, he said at the ADL, when they bragged that I was banned, Tim Cook said, we will ban anything objectionable.
[03:03:17.479 --> 03:03:20.104]  That's whatever they want, whenever they want, always changing.
[03:03:20.184 --> 03:03:21.988]  My God, this is insane.
[03:03:22.699 --> 03:03:44.100]  And they knew we were pushing back, which is why they slipped it into that bill, because there's a lot of people who are educated now about Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides these tech companies safe harbor, which means that they can't be sued for criminally or be held civilly or criminally liable for anything that any user posts on the platform.
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:04:13.529]  Because it's a platform, they're not responsible for moderating the content, so they can't have it both ways, or they shouldn't be able to have it both ways, whereas, well, if you're not going to be held liable for what's put on the platform, then you can't moderate what's on the platform, and that's why newspapers are liable for what they post, because they're making editorial decisions, and they post on their platform, and they make the decisions, so if it's a civil violation, or if it's a criminal content, they're liable.
[03:04:13.849 --> 03:04:21.275]  Whereas Apple and Twitter and all these Facebook social media platforms, they're not liable for what users post because of Section 230.
[03:04:21.676 --> 03:04:29.963]  So Section 230, they should either stop censoring unless it's a criminal content, or there's a civil judgment that something should be pulled.
[03:04:30.766 --> 03:04:34.767]  Or they should have their Section 230 Safe Harbor pulled.
[03:04:35.047 --> 03:04:36.768]  And we can't have it both ways.
[03:04:36.788 --> 03:04:37.288]  That's right, Mark.
[03:04:37.368 --> 03:04:38.828]  Incredibly good point.
[03:04:39.128 --> 03:04:41.409]  And that's why you're the genius out there with liberalism.
[03:04:41.709 --> 03:04:45.070]  Find a cure available at Infowarsstore.com and MarkDice.com.
[03:04:45.810 --> 03:04:48.811]  Bottom line, America, Trump, all of us must move against these companies.
[03:04:49.031 --> 03:04:51.752]  They're also trying to block Gab, Infowars, and shut us all down.
[03:04:51.992 --> 03:04:53.152]  So there's not competition.
[03:04:53.172 --> 03:04:54.933]  They're going after our credit card processing.
[03:04:55.173 --> 03:04:58.594]  These are clear and present dangers allied with communist China, but the world's awake.
[03:04:58.954 --> 03:05:00.235]  Have a great weekend, Mark Dice.
[03:05:00.275 --> 03:05:00.856]  Great job.
[03:05:00.916 --> 03:05:02.097]  Coming up, another big gift.
[03:05:03.438 --> 03:05:03.878]  Look at that.
[03:05:03.898 --> 03:05:08.943]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[03:05:09.263 --> 03:05:10.024]  We didn't do that.
[03:05:11.667 --> 03:05:15.790]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, but this is the very best I can get.
[03:05:16.211 --> 03:05:17.872]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[03:05:18.452 --> 03:05:26.999]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that good will!
[03:05:27.459 --> 03:05:29.161]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[03:05:29.201 --> 03:05:30.301]  Don't you get the big secret?
[03:05:30.982 --> 03:05:33.504]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[03:05:33.544 --> 03:05:34.645]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[03:05:35.425 --> 03:05:38.348]  And this little jewel right here is solid.
[03:05:41.181 --> 03:05:42.522]  Liquid Consciousness.
[03:05:45.904 --> 03:05:46.265]  Look it up.
[03:05:47.365 --> 03:05:47.846]  Find out.
[03:05:47.866 --> 03:05:53.390]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[03:05:53.410 --> 03:05:58.273]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[03:05:58.754 --> 03:06:00.955]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products.

[03:06:04.246 --> 03:06:08.309]  These conspiracy theories were first spread by radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:12.992]  But to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it?
[03:06:13.412 --> 03:06:16.034]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.

[03:06:46.447 --> 03:06:50.088]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:06:50.128 --> 03:06:52.009]  Time to stop submitting to this parody!
[03:06:52.049 --> 03:06:54.230]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[03:06:54.550 --> 03:06:55.871]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[03:06:56.051 --> 03:06:57.752]  InfoWars went even further.

[03:07:35.430 --> 03:07:41.073]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:07:44.074 --> 03:07:48.436]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:07:52.058 --> 03:07:59.621]  If you like to talk to racist tomatoes, if a bigoted squash can make you smile.
[03:07:59.701 --> 03:08:00.481]  That's racist!
[03:08:06.784 --> 03:08:16.051]  Cal State San Marcos held a whiteness forum in which they discussed topics relating to America's systemic racism.
[03:08:16.732 --> 03:08:22.956]  That was when they decided to bring up how VeggieTales is a racist cartoon.
[03:08:23.377 --> 03:08:28.581]  You know, the little series that teaches your children about the Bible and eating vegetables?
[03:08:29.301 --> 03:08:34.926]  Well, apparently VeggieTales is racist, according to liberals.
[03:08:35.646 --> 03:08:38.807]  The villains in VeggieTales have ethnic accents.
[03:08:38.987 --> 03:08:39.627]  Wait, wait, wait.
[03:08:39.987 --> 03:08:46.169]  They're saying the VeggieTales are racist because the villains are vegetables of color?
[03:08:46.589 --> 03:08:47.589]  What do you think?
[03:08:48.289 --> 03:08:50.290]  I think you look like Captain Crunch.
[03:08:50.850 --> 03:08:51.130]  Huh?
[03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:52.530]  No, I don't.
[03:08:53.150 --> 03:08:53.670]  Do too.
[03:08:54.011 --> 03:09:03.513]  When the kids see the good white character triumph over the bad colored vegetable character, they see white as right and minorities as evil.
[03:09:04.429 --> 03:09:06.730]  All vegetables are colorful.
[03:09:06.950 --> 03:09:08.991]  The heroes are vegetables of color.
[03:09:10.191 --> 03:09:12.372]  So the villains are going to be vegetables of color.
[03:09:12.912 --> 03:09:17.814]  All of the characters are going to be vegetables of color because they're all vegetables in VeggieTales.
[03:09:19.171 --> 03:09:20.592]  Creek, that is your cue!
[03:09:20.712 --> 03:09:22.053]  Just follow along, you will be fine.
[03:09:22.413 --> 03:09:25.455]  Watch the cucumber.
[03:09:25.595 --> 03:09:28.036]  See how he moves.
[03:09:28.276 --> 03:09:29.277]  I'm confused!
[03:09:30.157 --> 03:09:35.280]  Please, please, please show me these white vegetables on VeggieTales.
[03:09:35.580 --> 03:09:42.724]  My son has VeggieTales movies, and I've never seen a white tomato or a white squash.
[03:09:43.124 --> 03:09:45.925]  So please show me these white vegetable characters.
[03:09:46.305 --> 03:09:56.309]  And if you're talking about accents and how people speak, and you're regarding English as something that only white people can use, you're the racist one, aren't you?
[03:09:56.749 --> 03:09:57.049]  Right?
[03:09:57.109 --> 03:09:59.810]  Like, only white people use proper English?
[03:10:00.150 --> 03:10:04.812]  Seriously, that's racist to think that only white people use proper English.
[03:10:05.152 --> 03:10:07.613]  What's wrong with you, you freakin' racist?
[03:10:07.833 --> 03:10:08.793]  That's racist!
[03:10:09.313 --> 03:10:10.774]  I'll throw it right back at you.
[03:10:10.794 --> 03:10:24.865]  Well, maybe if they had an orange character in this VeggieTales classic that triumphed over everyone, I'm sure they'd say that this is teaching children that Orange Man is good, and it's completely wrong!
[03:10:25.826 --> 03:10:26.366]  Yeah!
[03:10:27.587 --> 03:10:28.747]  Orange man bad!
[03:10:28.767 --> 03:10:35.651]  They're just trying to add character to vegetables, which is kind of hard to do when they're just vegetables.
[03:10:36.431 --> 03:10:39.312]  Where are these people getting these things?
[03:10:39.533 --> 03:10:42.114]  We're taking anti-racist stance.
[03:10:42.134 --> 03:10:44.575]  We sort of trace Christianity through time.
[03:10:44.715 --> 03:10:49.997]  We call it Christianity the white religion because it's embracing these white ideologies such as
[03:10:51.659 --> 03:10:53.741]  Sort of like this fear that we have.
[03:10:53.761 --> 03:10:57.025]  Yes, this is an attack on Christians and Christianity.
[03:10:57.045 --> 03:10:58.427]  Because it's all biblical.
[03:10:58.887 --> 03:11:02.151]  Remember what your parents teach you and what you've learned from the Bible.
[03:11:02.592 --> 03:11:07.118]  If someone wants you to do something that you know is wrong, stand firm and do what's right.
[03:11:08.619 --> 03:11:10.039]  We're doing white face and comedy.
[03:11:10.680 --> 03:11:21.203]  We felt like white face and comedy would be a good way to expose white privilege and white domination because it's a good way, it's a light-hearted way to bring up race without it being too offensive.
[03:11:21.423 --> 03:11:36.447]  So in this class we look at how it is that white privilege has been institutionalized and embedded in our public and social everyday lives and so that we can understand the system of racism that we currently live in.
[03:11:37.265 --> 03:11:38.225]  VeggieTales!
[03:11:38.285 --> 03:11:39.846]  Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:39.926 --> 03:11:41.407]  Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:41.507 --> 03:11:41.847]  Bigots!
[03:11:41.927 --> 03:11:42.287]  Bigots!
[03:11:42.347 --> 03:11:42.787]  Bigots!
[03:11:43.188 --> 03:11:44.268]  Bigotry!
[03:11:44.588 --> 03:11:45.929]  Misogyny!
[03:11:46.669 --> 03:11:48.670]  Racist VeggieTales!
[03:11:50.731 --> 03:11:52.992]  It's Veg Veg Veg Veg VeggieTales!
[03:11:54.032 --> 03:12:00.435]  Time for Racist VeggieTales!
[03:12:00.455 --> 03:12:00.735]  There you go.
[03:12:00.795 --> 03:12:03.016]  I think I left out sexist VeggieTales too.
[03:12:03.076 --> 03:12:04.457]  I'm sure that will be the next one.
[03:12:05.492 --> 03:12:07.854]  There's not enough female vegetable characters.
[03:12:08.915 --> 03:12:11.677]  Or they're enforcing gender roles on the vegetables.
[03:12:11.837 --> 03:12:12.498]  They're all phallic.
[03:12:12.818 --> 03:12:13.018]  Yeah.
[03:12:14.239 --> 03:12:18.803]  Those, most of those veggie tales are phallic shaped vegetables.
[03:12:19.244 --> 03:12:24.248]  Therefore, it's sexist and it's enforcing gender stereotyping roles.
[03:12:26.610 --> 03:12:27.911]  Okay, I just made that last one up.
[03:12:37.810 --> 03:12:39.130]  There's not even the same universe.
[03:12:39.170 --> 03:12:42.812]  I mean, she is an abject, psychopathic demon from hell.
[03:12:42.992 --> 03:12:50.094]  People around her say she's so dark now, and so evil, and so possessed that they are having nightmares.
[03:12:50.114 --> 03:12:51.215]  They're freaking out.
[03:12:51.355 --> 03:12:55.076]  Folks, they say, listen, Obama and Hillary both smell like sulfur.
[03:12:56.886 --> 03:13:00.027]  I have two words for you.
[03:13:01.207 --> 03:13:02.468]  But you're drunk.
[03:13:24.309 --> 03:13:26.830]  There's a guy on the radio.
[03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:28.930]  He said he and Hillary are demons.
[03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:31.271]  Said we smell like sulfur.
[03:13:31.491 --> 03:13:33.671]  Ain't that something?
[03:13:33.831 --> 03:13:36.952]  I'm not just being tacky.
[03:13:37.072 --> 03:13:41.853]  I'm calling Margaret Newton-Samoa.
[03:13:41.873 --> 03:13:46.995]  I had never seen or smelled any woman like her.
[03:14:00.554 --> 03:14:10.180]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:11.741]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:14:11.801 --> 03:14:28.133]  So Matt, you're nervous.
[03:14:29.908 --> 03:14:34.971]  There's a lot of flies in here and the center is going to do something about these flies.
[03:14:43.915 --> 03:14:46.097]  And welcome back to WimpleWars.com.
[03:14:46.937 --> 03:14:49.979]  This is Dr. Nick Begich standing in in this last hour.
[03:14:51.279 --> 03:14:54.001]  And I'm sorry about the confusion.
[03:14:54.041 --> 03:14:57.162]  You know, I'm in a little remote location.
[03:14:57.222 --> 03:14:58.063]  I'm headed down to
[03:14:59.537 --> 03:15:04.781]  Visit Alex here in a couple of days and do some work live in studio.
[03:15:06.423 --> 03:15:09.705]  So I want to get into a little different topic today.
[03:15:09.725 --> 03:15:23.216]  I want to go back to some of my traditional subject matter, which is really the issue of mind control manipulation of human behavior, which is what we're dealing with right now.
[03:15:23.577 --> 03:15:26.219]  When we look at the media, we look at what's happening.
[03:15:27.407 --> 03:15:33.452]  Around the world, this is the core of behavior modification on a grand scale.
[03:15:34.232 --> 03:15:35.473]  And so we're going to cover that today.
[03:15:35.513 --> 03:15:36.754]  We're going to get into some details.
[03:15:37.215 --> 03:15:48.383]  We've got a few segments left, and we want to get into this to really talk about the New World Order and where we're headed, where this is going, and what we can do.
[03:15:49.424 --> 03:15:50.665]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:15:50.685 --> 03:15:54.148]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and you'll be right back shortly.
[03:16:02.907 --> 03:16:10.973]  Introducing the final and biggest sale of 2018, InfoWars is proud to introduce the 12 Days of Christmas.
[03:16:11.254 --> 03:16:22.402]  And it's bigger than any previous sale before as this sale just escalates as we attempt to clear out all of our amazing inventory to escape the dreaded inventory tax at the end of the year.

[03:17:39.137 --> 03:17:41.779]  You fund the very tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[03:17:42.259 --> 03:17:48.461]  Today's 24-hour only special at InfoWarStore.com is the powerful Silver Bullet.
[03:17:48.581 --> 03:17:49.421]  Always a great deal.
[03:17:49.441 --> 03:17:51.621]  It's now 60% off.
[03:17:52.042 --> 03:17:54.882]  And Knockout Sleep Support, now 60% off.
[03:17:55.002 --> 03:17:59.163]  I want to thank you all again for making the entire InfoWar possible.
[03:17:59.523 --> 03:18:01.464]  Again, you are the resistance.
[03:18:06.292 --> 03:18:14.660]  I've been on air 23 plus years, and I've learned a lot about sales, because that's how we finance our operation to defend the Republic and our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and our way of life.
[03:18:15.401 --> 03:18:19.985]  I was never classically trained, but over the last 23 years, I've learned about the different systems of sales.
[03:18:20.706 --> 03:18:25.971]  And there's lots of philosophies about having something really, really expensive and a certain percentage will buy it, believing it's the best.
[03:18:26.772 --> 03:18:27.692]  That's not what I do.
[03:18:28.493 --> 03:18:31.016]  I try to find the very best products that are popular,
[03:18:31.896 --> 03:18:34.737]  Get the best deal on it, so I can sell the most of it.
[03:18:34.817 --> 03:18:35.997]  That seems to be like common sense.
[03:18:36.117 --> 03:18:44.400]  Whatever people like the best, whatever I like the best, whatever's the best value, then I'll sell it for the lowest price, but then I'll dominate the market and be the biggest seller of it.
[03:18:44.420 --> 03:18:51.702]  And I am, at InfoWars, the biggest distributor of Alexa Pure, Pro, Water Filtration, Gravity Fetch systems, because they're the very best.
[03:18:51.822 --> 03:18:56.443]  They can give us the best deals to sell them to you at the lowest price, and so we are the biggest distributor.
[03:18:56.643 --> 03:18:59.684]  Now, year of end came, and they gave us the biggest deal ever.
[03:19:00.524 --> 03:19:03.025]  Of 127 on that water filtration system.
[03:19:03.045 --> 03:19:05.367]  Because they didn't want to have to pay inventory at the end of the year.
[03:19:05.487 --> 03:19:06.707]  We sold out of it.
[03:19:06.728 --> 03:19:07.868]  They didn't think we could do it.
[03:19:08.488 --> 03:19:09.089]  You responded.
[03:19:09.109 --> 03:19:10.109]  You went and did your own research.
[03:19:10.370 --> 03:19:11.490]  Knew it was an incredible deal.
[03:19:11.970 --> 03:19:16.693]  They also make the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration four-stage ion filter.
[03:19:16.733 --> 03:19:20.315]  When they came to me five years ago and said, we've developed a great ion filter.
[03:19:20.375 --> 03:19:21.276]  Many competitors are $500, $600, $800, $1,000.
[03:19:21.436 --> 03:19:23.337]  This is just as good or better than most of them.
[03:19:23.357 --> 03:19:24.117]  We're going to sell it for $300.
[03:19:24.157 --> 03:19:24.417]  I said, great.
[03:19:24.437 --> 03:19:24.838]  Absolutely.
[03:19:24.858 --> 03:19:25.718]  I just bought filters for
[03:19:29.420 --> 03:19:30.020]  We're good to go!
[03:20:06.647 --> 03:20:09.249]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.875 --> 03:20:29.461]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:20:30.081 --> 03:20:32.964]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:36.266 --> 03:20:37.067]  Hey, welcome back.
[03:20:38.148 --> 03:20:41.430]  And I appreciate everyone being here and supporting this network.
[03:20:41.551 --> 03:20:47.375]  I am really proud to be a substitute host here with Alex and the team.
[03:20:47.776 --> 03:20:50.037]  What a great team it is to work with.
[03:20:50.698 --> 03:20:51.819]  Highly professional.
[03:20:52.612 --> 03:20:53.533]  Very skilled.
[03:20:53.753 --> 03:20:54.733]  Great job they do.
[03:20:54.813 --> 03:20:55.794]  And I appreciate it.
[03:20:56.614 --> 03:21:18.847]  You know, talking about mind control issues, which is one of the areas where I've covered over the last 20 years, one of the first subjects that we talked about with Alex, you know, when we when we look at sort of what's happening, when you think of the media and how the media works, it generates a certain level of fear, anxiety,
[03:21:19.634 --> 03:21:20.114]  Tension?
[03:21:20.495 --> 03:21:27.238]  The things that actually disturb a person's ability to reach your higher states of awareness.
[03:21:28.399 --> 03:21:34.723]  The way to focus, look at things, is altered by the way media comes at us.
[03:21:35.243 --> 03:21:42.607]  On the screen right now is a reference to the CIA MKUltra mind control experiments, which go back to the 1950s, 1960s.
[03:21:42.627 --> 03:21:43.868]  These projects were huge.
[03:21:48.610 --> 03:21:52.313]  And they were looking at a number of different ways to affect people.
[03:21:52.413 --> 03:21:56.976]  One was chemical, using chemical substances that would affect people's human behavior.
[03:21:58.077 --> 03:22:02.620]  Things like LSD, hallucinogenics of various types were tried.
[03:22:03.320 --> 03:22:14.348]  Other things that were utilized in these experiments were electromagnetic signals, signals that could manipulate human behavior in a very subtle
[03:22:16.307 --> 03:22:29.152]  In fact, if you look at the work of Persinger at Laurentian University, what he did is a study on the effects of manipulating emotions, which is a relatively simple thing.
[03:22:29.472 --> 03:22:38.335]  And the way it's done is a signal is sent in, and the brain literally locks onto these external signals.
[03:22:38.576 --> 03:22:42.417]  And it's based on a pulse rate, a specific frequency,
[03:22:43.436 --> 03:22:47.198]  That overlays and connects with the human brain.
[03:22:48.218 --> 03:23:02.906]  And so what you can do and what Persinger said we could do is you could broadcast a signal across a large geographic area that created, say, a certain amount of anxiety, fear, and then just run the normal news feed through the media.
[03:23:03.506 --> 03:23:09.249]  And you'll see really clearly the ability to move a population.
[03:23:10.369 --> 03:23:22.674]  On the screen now is a great illustration, and what it's showing is some of the very deep states of brain activity, and up to the beta, the active state.
[03:23:23.274 --> 03:23:27.855]  And so what you have in the beginning, deep states of sleep, are delta.
[03:23:27.956 --> 03:23:29.216]  That's below four hertz.
[03:23:30.236 --> 03:23:31.777]  This is pulses per second.
[03:23:32.777 --> 03:23:37.559]  And so what happens below that level, this is where you are in that deep, deep state of dreaming.
[03:23:38.576 --> 03:23:42.560]  Now, artificially, it's very difficult to drive a person there.
[03:23:43.621 --> 03:23:47.985]  Now, the state above that, theta, is very easy.
[03:23:48.205 --> 03:23:49.366]  It's 4 to 8 hertz.
[03:23:50.327 --> 03:23:59.855]  Now, this is where you are in deep meditation, in dream states, altered states of awareness, and they can push you into this.
[03:24:01.197 --> 03:24:02.418]  And what happens with this
[03:24:03.453 --> 03:24:14.760]  With this push, is the brain locks on in what's called a frequency following response, where you literally lock on, you begin to mirror the signal, and you fall into that emotional state.
[03:24:16.080 --> 03:24:29.288]  And then, you think about it, when you're getting a broadcast coming in, and it can come in through television, radio, any electromagnetic carrier, your cell phone device,
[03:24:30.602 --> 03:24:40.428]  Um, just think about anything that carries a signal, whether it's your power grid coming into your house or broadcast signals.
[03:24:40.488 --> 03:24:40.708]  Wow.
[03:24:41.888 --> 03:24:47.812]  And what you can do is you can piggyback a signal and you can kill that and you receive it.
[03:24:48.172 --> 03:24:52.694]  But the brain will change and move into this, um, this other frame of reference.
[03:24:54.055 --> 03:24:55.616]  And so what happens then is
[03:24:56.940 --> 03:25:05.005]  You can literally program a population emotionally and then feed in the normal news feed through, say, a television.
[03:25:06.586 --> 03:25:11.069]  And that information is anchored fundamentally deeper.
[03:25:14.451 --> 03:25:18.034]  And you perceive the world also the way you interact with the world.
[03:25:18.214 --> 03:25:19.354]  It's very, very simple.
[03:25:20.755 --> 03:25:24.558]  And so it's a matter of generating fear, anxiety to shut down
[03:25:27.771 --> 03:25:34.016]  The highalities that you meant and then to add in a signal that distorts the way we're normally functioning.
[03:25:35.497 --> 03:25:42.483]  And so when you think about frequency following, we're supposed to think about anything that can carry that signal.
[03:25:43.964 --> 03:25:45.145]  And now let me give you another example.
[03:25:45.446 --> 03:25:50.410]  Um, from the standpoint of advertisers, this is very frequent method.
[03:25:50.430 --> 03:25:52.892]  That's supply.
[03:25:52.912 --> 03:25:56.575]  And what they what they essentially do is create that background signal.
[03:25:57.193 --> 03:26:05.878]  And then when that background signal comes in, you fall into that suggestive state and then the advertising runs and it just anchors in.
[03:26:06.918 --> 03:26:10.940]  So this is used commercially, politically and otherwise.
[03:26:10.960 --> 03:26:18.464]  Now, when you think about controlling populations on a broader basis, think about some of the simpler things.
[03:26:19.685 --> 03:26:23.967]  Like the Googles and the Apples and these organizations, Facebook,
[03:26:25.243 --> 03:26:33.228]  All of them have developed systems for not so much manipulating as monitoring.
[03:26:34.168 --> 03:26:40.772]  And when you monitor people's activity, then you can deduce tremendous amount of data about them.
[03:26:40.892 --> 03:26:49.837]  In fact, these organizations have incorporated with China to create their social scoring because the Chinese won't let them do business there.
[03:26:50.905 --> 03:26:55.887]  Unless they have access to their systems and those data feeds and everything everybody's doing.
[03:26:56.667 --> 03:27:01.349]  So they've created social profiling programming for the communists.
[03:27:02.650 --> 03:27:07.492]  And they're applying it commercially in the United States and the rest of the world.
[03:27:07.892 --> 03:27:16.055]  Only this is being run by the big CEOs of the shapers of opinion in the 21st century.
[03:27:16.115 --> 03:27:18.176]  And this is where the fundamental error is.
[03:27:19.631 --> 03:27:36.441]  Because when you consider the fact that they've developed these things for communists to control and manipulate their populations, and now they're using it to manipulate the speech of Americans by manipulating the feed of data.
[03:27:36.681 --> 03:27:42.325]  And this is through shadow banning, which Alex has talked about, through banning this network.
[03:27:43.986 --> 03:27:45.887]  And when you start to think about all of this,
[03:27:46.932 --> 03:27:49.534]  This is 1984 on steroids.
[03:27:50.475 --> 03:27:59.001]  Nobody expected this, but we predicted it 25 years ago and started talking about this 25 years ago.
[03:27:59.501 --> 03:28:04.224]  And when I look at where we've come, it's right on target.
[03:28:05.105 --> 03:28:06.226]  But here's the other part of this.
[03:28:06.246 --> 03:28:13.731]  Whenever you have these huge changes in politics, economics, our social platform,
[03:28:14.978 --> 03:28:20.641]  You end up creating a tension, a pushback, and that pushback has begun.
[03:28:20.661 --> 03:28:23.363]  And this is what I see.
[03:28:24.503 --> 03:28:31.007]  It's moving people into action where we recognize we have no choice, we have to engage.
[03:28:31.027 --> 03:28:38.351]  And we can engage respectfully, we can engage consciously, and we can engage with an awareness that changes this world.
[03:28:39.532 --> 03:28:41.353]  This network is part of that change.
[03:28:41.992 --> 03:28:53.043]  The people who come on and speak on this network, we're here to inform, to elevate the consciousness of this population, so we can take our governments back from around the world.
[03:28:53.623 --> 03:28:54.584]  We're going to be right back.
[03:28:54.604 --> 03:28:55.825]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:28:55.885 --> 03:29:00.770]  I'm standing in for Alex Jones in this fourth hour on the Friday, and we'll be back with you shortly.
[03:29:01.370 --> 03:29:01.711]  Thanks for...
[03:29:17.142 --> 03:29:26.246]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this limited run shirt that the crew had the idea to do because there's a popular saying on the internet, we're all Alex Jones.
[03:29:26.827 --> 03:29:27.727]  Don't censor me.
[03:29:28.207 --> 03:29:33.790]  And it's got the Gadsden coiled snake instead of don't tread on me or won't tread on me.
[03:29:33.910 --> 03:29:35.711]  It says, we're all Alex Jones.
[03:29:36.191 --> 03:29:37.132]  Don't censor me.
[03:29:37.912 --> 03:29:41.656]  It's a very soft, nice fabric, black on white t-shirt.
[03:29:41.756 --> 03:29:46.582]  It is absolutely free at InfowarStore.com with any purchase.
[03:29:46.902 --> 03:29:53.490]  That means one tube of toothpaste, fluoride-free, colonial silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, or a water filtration system.
[03:29:53.510 --> 03:29:55.672]  Or you buy another t-shirt, you get this one free.
[03:29:56.093 --> 03:29:57.675]  And there's store-wide free shipping.
[03:29:58.075 --> 03:30:02.977]  And there's 50 to 75% off across the board on thousands of items.
[03:30:02.997 --> 03:30:06.738]  50% is the lowest special, 75% is the highest.
[03:30:06.818 --> 03:30:16.822]  We are selling all of our inventory out to go leaner and meaner into the new year, because you've seen how Soros and the Globals are trying to shut down InfoWars, trying to take our payment processors, trying to shut us down.
[03:30:16.862 --> 03:30:25.025]  So this way you don't battle the crowds, you don't battle the traffic, you get hands down the best deals we've ever offered on best-selling items that would still probably sell out.
[03:30:25.145 --> 03:30:27.167]  Some of the stuff we've got by February or so.
[03:30:27.207 --> 03:30:31.910]  No, I'm selling the entire warehouse right here in Austin, Texas out by the end of this year.
[03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:33.271]  And we're on line to do it.
[03:30:33.371 --> 03:30:34.412]  So everything's for sale.
[03:30:34.612 --> 03:30:35.733]  Some things are about to sell out.
[03:30:35.773 --> 03:30:36.714]  Some things have already sold out.
[03:30:36.754 --> 03:30:38.855]  We still have, I'd say, 90% of our different items.
[03:30:38.995 --> 03:30:42.338]  But in the next few days, obviously, those numbers are going to start going down.
[03:30:42.358 --> 03:30:43.659]  But right now, it's all there.
[03:30:43.779 --> 03:30:46.481]  X3, X2, Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:30:46.621 --> 03:30:47.382]  Let me say that again.
[03:30:47.442 --> 03:30:51.606]  You get store-wide free shipping, 50-75% off, double Patriot points on your next order.
[03:30:51.866 --> 03:30:54.849]  So instead of 5% on each dollar, you get 10 cents on every dollar.
[03:30:54.910 --> 03:30:55.590]  This is insane.
[03:30:56.111 --> 03:30:57.933]  And this free t-shirt.
[03:30:57.993 --> 03:31:01.016]  Now, they printed 5,000 of these up.
[03:31:01.176 --> 03:31:05.520]  So that means by the end of this week, Christmas sales are always heavy.
[03:31:06.381 --> 03:31:07.541]  These shirts will be sold out.
[03:31:07.621 --> 03:31:09.282]  This is a limited edition.
[03:31:09.862 --> 03:31:10.702]  We're all Alex Jones.
[03:31:10.742 --> 03:31:11.643]  Don't censor me.
[03:31:11.703 --> 03:31:16.104]  And then it'll be a new shirt that will be the free gift that you get with it.
[03:31:16.124 --> 03:31:18.025]  It'll be another one of these great shirts we've got.
[03:31:18.125 --> 03:31:20.285]  But they're all there at InfoWorksStore.com.
[03:31:20.365 --> 03:31:21.606]  So you cannot beat this deal.
[03:31:21.646 --> 03:31:26.967]  This is way above even the specials I've been running the last two months that have already been our biggest ever.
[03:31:27.107 --> 03:31:28.128]  So take advantage of it.
[03:31:28.208 --> 03:31:30.028]  Help us fund ourselves into next year.
[03:31:30.268 --> 03:31:31.969]  Try some of the great products you've never tried.
[03:31:32.109 --> 03:31:33.389]  Try Alphabowl.
[03:31:33.609 --> 03:31:34.850]  Try RainForce.
[03:31:35.090 --> 03:31:35.750]  Try Xtend.
[03:31:36.390 --> 03:31:41.334]  Try Super Male and Super Female Vitality, which is incredibly high-quality, cold-pressed herbs.
[03:31:41.434 --> 03:31:42.395]  Five-star ratings.
[03:31:42.495 --> 03:31:43.656]  We've had it out for four years.
[03:31:43.736 --> 03:31:46.338]  I'm discontinuing because it's so expensive for us to make.
[03:31:46.478 --> 03:31:50.821]  It's so proprietary where we get it from Utah, one of the biggest firms out there, and I'm just done.
[03:31:50.981 --> 03:31:52.723]  That's it for Super Male Vitality, Super Female Vitality.
[03:31:52.763 --> 03:31:53.243]  It's amazing.
[03:31:53.363 --> 03:31:53.743]  We want it.
[03:31:53.764 --> 03:31:54.124]  It's there.
[03:31:54.264 --> 03:31:55.625]  Alpha Power is organic.
[03:31:55.725 --> 03:31:56.566]  It's a similar formula.
[03:31:56.606 --> 03:31:57.527]  It's even stronger.
[03:31:57.607 --> 03:31:58.848]  But, it's not cold-pressed.
[03:31:58.908 --> 03:32:01.571]  So, some people like Super Mel's for Tumult Vitality Morph.
[03:32:01.591 --> 03:32:06.356]  Alpha Power is amazing and it costs a fraction of what Super Mel's for Tumult do.
[03:32:06.376 --> 03:32:08.177]  But, right now, they're 50% off.
[03:32:08.338 --> 03:32:11.060]  And there's just a bunch of other specials at mfulworthstore.com.
[03:32:11.100 --> 03:32:14.644]  So, I would just encourage you all to go to mfulworthstore.com.

[03:32:25.911 --> 03:32:29.954]  mforcestore.com or mforcelife.com takes you right to the supplement page.
[03:32:30.214 --> 03:32:32.735]  Please promote our local radio affiliates.
[03:32:32.956 --> 03:32:37.879]  It is so vital that if you're listening to us in California or Texas or New York, however you're listening, remember,
[03:32:38.539 --> 03:32:40.461]  You're the only person that can get past the censors.
[03:32:41.161 --> 03:32:47.987]  So tell people about that local radio station, about that local TV station, and tell folks about their local URL as well.
[03:32:48.547 --> 03:32:50.169]  Word of mouth is king in this fight.
[03:33:06.039 --> 03:33:18.447]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:18.667 --> 03:33:24.991]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.531 --> 03:33:29.094]  And now, your host, Nick Begich.
[03:33:34.404 --> 03:33:36.825]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:33:36.845 --> 03:33:42.388]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, standing in in its fourth hour this Friday afternoon.
[03:33:42.488 --> 03:33:44.649]  And it's a pleasure to be with everyone again.
[03:33:44.669 --> 03:33:52.133]  We're getting into this mind control issue and area because it is fundamental to many of the things that are going on in the world right now.
[03:33:52.273 --> 03:33:57.915]  And during the last segment, I was talking about the frequency following response and how that works.
[03:33:58.236 --> 03:34:01.017]  And then I was also talking about the China social scoring.
[03:34:01.537 --> 03:34:02.038]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:34:18.328 --> 03:34:25.010]  The internet and the information age that we're in, where you can literally gather any perspective that you want.
[03:34:25.090 --> 03:34:26.070]  And here's what's happened.
[03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:29.271]  It's actually worked the opposite of what people expected.
[03:34:29.651 --> 03:34:38.874]  People expected a more informed, a more interactive, a more cohesive global community, which didn't happen.
[03:34:38.914 --> 03:34:42.955]  They expected a more cohesive community within the US.
[03:34:42.995 --> 03:34:43.995]  That didn't really happen.
[03:34:44.335 --> 03:34:46.876]  What they got instead was the narrowing
[03:34:47.276 --> 03:34:48.357]  of people's perspective.
[03:34:48.717 --> 03:34:53.280]  In other words, people only get the data feeds that they're really interested in.
[03:34:53.340 --> 03:34:55.641]  So it kind of amplifies their own thinking.
[03:34:55.721 --> 03:34:58.823]  It doesn't really broaden the thinking the way it used to be.
[03:34:58.883 --> 03:35:02.505]  We used to get, you know, three or four television stations, at least in my world.
[03:35:03.545 --> 03:35:09.789]  But what happened is you get sort of all of the news, the left, the right, the in the middle, all of it would come to us.
[03:35:10.229 --> 03:35:14.632]  And we will kind of discern and pick through and make our value judgments and decide
[03:35:15.052 --> 03:35:19.175]  You know, what we wanted to believe, but we always kind of got both sides of the big issues.
[03:35:19.716 --> 03:35:40.112]  Today we don't do that, because unless we purpose ourselves to look at our opposition, to look at those that oppose our ideas and ideals, so we understand the arguments, so we are better prepared, so we don't have what happened to the left when they were living in their bubble world and their bubble burst because they didn't have the full picture.
[03:35:40.212 --> 03:35:42.113]  They didn't even know there was a debate going on.
[03:35:42.514 --> 03:35:43.995]  We should not follow.
[03:35:44.495 --> 03:35:46.136]  The same direction as the liberals.
[03:35:46.756 --> 03:35:52.118]  We need to know what liberals are thinking, we need to know how they think, and we know how to construct our arguments based on that.
[03:35:52.678 --> 03:35:55.739]  I come from a very liberal background in terms of my family.
[03:35:55.879 --> 03:36:00.941]  I'm a conservative, a very strict conservative in fact, and a libertarian.
[03:36:01.545 --> 03:36:14.451]  But when I get into the debates with my brothers, which I do, and my sisters, which I do, and my mother, which I do, actually, they're pretty exciting debates if you're watching them from the outside because we differ so much.
[03:36:15.211 --> 03:36:16.992]  But there's some fundamental things that we do.
[03:36:17.132 --> 03:36:22.233]  We listen very carefully because we want to know how each other presents our arguments.
[03:36:22.433 --> 03:36:27.094]  And then we can listen to those arguments and decide, are they missing information?
[03:36:27.374 --> 03:36:29.795]  Is there something that they're missing that I need to inform them of?
[03:36:30.275 --> 03:36:35.357]  Am I missing information, which might change my opinion by listening actively and carefully?
[03:36:35.817 --> 03:36:39.838]  At the end of that listening, now I can feedback and we have a discussion.
[03:36:39.858 --> 03:36:40.738]  We're good to go.
[03:37:06.593 --> 03:37:17.639]  We need to engage this creative mind that God gave us and begin to apply it in the work that we do and the actions that we engage in and the interface we have with other people.
[03:37:18.299 --> 03:37:24.663]  You know, when you walk into a room and you carry the joy of the creation in you,
[03:37:25.299 --> 03:37:25.940]  People see it.
[03:37:26.460 --> 03:37:27.701]  People recognize it.
[03:37:27.982 --> 03:37:29.303]  And people want to talk about it.
[03:37:29.563 --> 03:37:30.925]  You know, we're in the Christmas season.
[03:37:31.325 --> 03:37:32.546]  We're in the holiday season.
[03:37:33.067 --> 03:37:39.933]  A time to reflect on values, what's important to us, and the direction in which our government and country is going.
[03:37:40.394 --> 03:37:45.799]  We have an opportunity in this generation, perhaps the last generation even.
[03:37:46.505 --> 03:37:50.688]  On this planet, who knows, you know, when the next coming is coming.
[03:37:51.988 --> 03:37:53.129]  But I can tell you this.
[03:37:54.230 --> 03:37:59.473]  We have an opportunity to see change when there's trauma and there's trauma coming.
[03:38:00.033 --> 03:38:01.254]  People begin to wake up.
[03:38:01.454 --> 03:38:10.419]  People began to recognize each other again and recognize the need to support one another again in the work we do professionally and otherwise.
[03:38:11.100 --> 03:38:14.342]  This kind of community of action
[03:38:14.941 --> 03:38:18.403]  Coupled with values is what makes a country great.
[03:38:18.823 --> 03:38:22.745]  I was just on radio in Europe, on the biggest independent radio in Europe recently.
[03:38:23.286 --> 03:38:28.448]  And this is, you know, my surprise when we talk about Europe and what's happening in the U.S.
[03:38:28.528 --> 03:38:31.330]  and the nationalistic movements happening throughout Europe.
[03:38:31.610 --> 03:38:33.591]  They're all driven by the same overlays.
[03:38:33.931 --> 03:38:36.593]  They lay a very specific thing culturally.
[03:38:36.673 --> 03:38:44.157]  I mean, whether I'm in Latin America, whether I'm in the United States or Canada or Europe, there's a little bit of a twist that the globalists apply.
[03:38:44.779 --> 03:38:49.782]  In order to socially engineer the direction in which societies go.
[03:38:50.223 --> 03:38:54.005]  This is what we're seeing, but the pushback is coming from the right.
[03:38:54.325 --> 03:39:05.793]  It's coming from nationalists, not just in the United States, but nationalists in Great Britain, nationalists in Germany, nationalists who recognize that sovereign nations are still valid in the 21st century.
[03:39:06.253 --> 03:39:14.499]  One of my biggest surprises that I mentioned on on radio here, the European Parliament, that nobody in the European Parliament is elected.
[03:39:15.539 --> 03:39:20.422]  No one elects any of these people and they call themselves a democratic institution?
[03:39:21.462 --> 03:39:23.743]  Give me a break.
[03:39:24.463 --> 03:39:31.807]  Most Europeans don't even have this cognitively in their head and we were discussing it in Europe earlier in the week.
[03:39:32.727 --> 03:39:37.229]  The idea that most Europeans don't even contemplate the fact that these unelected people
[03:39:37.953 --> 03:39:51.360]  Are determining to a great extent how Europe runs and then their financial systems hand over to global bankers who control the euro across all of the countries within the European Union, with a few exceptions that didn't opt for the euro.
[03:39:52.001 --> 03:39:54.942]  Croatia one case in point, they kept the Kuna.
[03:39:55.523 --> 03:40:03.407]  The point is that when you start to look at sort of the configuration, the detachment, because in the United States we understand one thing.
[03:40:04.346 --> 03:40:12.845]  Government comes and gains its validity from us as individual human beings, as individual living souls.
[03:40:13.406 --> 03:40:14.388]  We are the government.
[03:40:14.975 --> 03:40:16.156]  We form our government.
[03:40:16.416 --> 03:40:27.201]  And we need to take back that control of our government and assert our birthright as created human beings with certain rights fundamental to our very creation.
[03:40:27.642 --> 03:40:28.602]  And this is part of it.
[03:40:28.942 --> 03:40:30.703]  Governance comes from the people.
[03:40:31.024 --> 03:40:36.546]  The European Union, the European Parliament, has a governance that does not come from the population.
[03:40:36.606 --> 03:40:37.647]  They have no authority.
[03:40:38.027 --> 03:40:39.428]  They should have no authority.
[03:40:39.988 --> 03:40:43.150]  And what's going on with the movements in Europe is exactly
[03:40:43.610 --> 03:40:49.174]  The right course of action at a time when we need to begin and continue a pushback.
[03:40:49.674 --> 03:40:54.198]  We're all in this together as individual souls on this planet.
[03:40:54.298 --> 03:41:01.362]  We have different national interests that are clearly defined by our governments to some degree by our citizens to a greater degree.
[03:41:01.783 --> 03:41:03.664]  And that's where we need to put our emphasis.
[03:41:03.784 --> 03:41:07.046]  Recognize our differences across political spectrums.
[03:41:07.587 --> 03:41:12.070]  Look for opportunities where there is correspondence of values where we can cooperate together.
[03:41:12.748 --> 03:41:15.791]  Otherwise, we need to stay out and get out.
[03:41:16.252 --> 03:41:24.660]  And we need to ask people to excuse themselves from our affairs as well when they don't have a vested interest and are not citizens of this country.
[03:41:25.221 --> 03:41:27.503]  You know, big changes are coming.
[03:41:27.743 --> 03:41:31.407]  We're going to see, as much as everything is rosy today,
[03:41:32.245 --> 03:41:34.027]  There is a wave building.
[03:41:34.127 --> 03:41:35.868]  The bubble will one day burst.
[03:41:36.429 --> 03:41:38.871]  And then we will really need to rely on one another.
[03:41:39.412 --> 03:41:41.013]  More so than we ever have before.
[03:41:41.033 --> 03:41:45.757]  You know, recently in the last week, last Friday, I was in Alaska in my home.
[03:41:45.797 --> 03:41:48.360]  We had one of the biggest earthquakes that we've had since 1964.
[03:41:50.321 --> 03:41:52.083]  What does it do when these things happen?
[03:41:52.583 --> 03:41:54.365]  People quickly recognize.
[03:41:55.632 --> 03:41:57.353]  The need to support one another.
[03:41:57.813 --> 03:42:00.095]  We were lucky we had no serious injuries.
[03:42:00.155 --> 03:42:11.081]  We had no deaths, but we had people pulling together from the very moments of the beginning of that because that represents the character, the character of Americans.
[03:42:11.522 --> 03:42:13.063]  We're in the worst of situations.
[03:42:13.543 --> 03:42:18.426]  We stand together, we pull together and we make our systems work.
[03:42:19.176 --> 03:42:21.780]  You know, disasters of all different kinds happen.
[03:42:21.800 --> 03:42:23.382]  We have fires in California.
[03:42:23.683 --> 03:42:24.945]  We have earthquakes in Alaska.
[03:42:24.965 --> 03:42:26.607]  We have hurricanes in the southeast.
[03:42:27.348 --> 03:42:33.978]  All of these things remind us of first, our vulnerability, and then secondly, our need.
[03:42:34.858 --> 03:42:41.923]  To come together as human beings, begin to support each other in a more vibrant way, a way that truly changes the world.
[03:42:42.223 --> 03:42:43.304]  We're headed into a break.
[03:42:43.724 --> 03:42:46.927]  I again want to ask you to support InfoWars.com.
[03:42:46.967 --> 03:42:51.970]  If you want information, our books and products, go to the InfoWars store and check it out.
[03:42:52.030 --> 03:42:55.713]  We have the book on mind control, controlling the human mind, and all of our other titles.
[03:42:56.334 --> 03:43:10.034]  This is Nick Faget standing in for Alex Jones on this Friday afternoon, and we'll be right back after these important We have been in a continual state of war Since we bought into the idea of a permanent standing army after World War two
[03:43:10.854 --> 03:43:17.036]  We have a Saudi-led attack on Yemen, on the port, escalating in just a 24-hour span.
[03:43:17.276 --> 03:43:20.778]  At least 150 people killed after weeks of deadly fighting.
[03:43:21.138 --> 03:43:23.219]  Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Yemen.
[03:43:23.619 --> 03:43:24.359]  Any reporting on that?
[03:43:24.719 --> 03:43:24.879]  No.
[03:43:25.459 --> 03:43:27.020]  They don't care about the lives of people.
[03:43:27.100 --> 03:43:28.961]  They don't care about the lives of these Yemenis.
[03:43:29.021 --> 03:43:33.362]  They don't care about the lives of their own soldiers.
[03:43:33.422 --> 03:43:37.564]  And they don't care about the principles that these soldiers thought they were fighting for, either.
[03:43:38.168 --> 03:43:45.251]  The principles, just like the lives of the soldiers, are expendable in these manufactured wars for empire.
[03:43:45.871 --> 03:43:48.712]  And we've got something that is much more dangerous that is coming up right now.
[03:43:49.553 --> 03:43:55.595]  We're coming up to a cycle in human history, a generational turning point.
[03:43:56.216 --> 03:43:59.037]  And again, you should read the book, Fourth Turning, if you haven't.
[03:44:00.195 --> 03:44:10.117]  Strauss and Howe went back 500 years in American and English-British history to see this recurring cycle about every 80 years, having a major restructuring of society.
[03:44:11.258 --> 03:44:14.418]  Frequently, these restructurings are accompanied by wars.
[03:44:15.379 --> 03:44:18.259]  Things like the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War II.
[03:44:18.299 --> 03:44:19.940]  Those were all forthcoming.
[03:44:21.100 --> 03:44:26.861]  Now, as we talk about resurging old demons, that's what I see coming.
[03:44:27.341 --> 03:44:29.242]  I see history being recycled.
[03:44:30.789 --> 03:44:53.285]  And when you have these standing armies, when you have these politicians who have an empire mindset like Macron, who are trying to accrue and concentrate power to themselves, those are the elements that create things like World War I. Because it was the type of thing that the founders had always looked at Europe as having.
[03:44:53.305 --> 03:44:56.427]  These constant, eternal European wars.
[03:44:56.707 --> 03:44:57.928]  Not a remaking of society.
[03:44:59.070 --> 03:45:01.212]  Because, you know, people look at that and they say, that was a just war.
[03:45:01.612 --> 03:45:03.114]  That was a justifiable war.
[03:45:03.214 --> 03:45:03.394]  Whatever.
[03:45:03.414 --> 03:45:09.961]  They look at the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, they look at World War II and they say, yeah, that was a time when we were really fighting for something.
[03:45:09.981 --> 03:45:11.342]  World War I, they weren't fighting for anything.
[03:45:12.603 --> 03:45:15.025]  Patriotism was summed up by Smedley Butler.
[03:45:15.306 --> 03:45:18.869]  He said, talking about true patriotism, he said, we fight to protect our home.
[03:45:20.411 --> 03:45:21.372]  And our Constitution.
[03:45:22.874 --> 03:45:24.716]  So we fight to defend our lives.
[03:45:24.796 --> 03:45:26.998]  To defend our lives.
[03:45:27.418 --> 03:45:30.141]  Not in foreign wars of empire.
[03:45:30.901 --> 03:45:33.043]  Not for regime change in the Middle East.
[03:45:33.584 --> 03:45:35.185]  We fight to defend our homes.
[03:45:35.205 --> 03:45:37.007]  He said everything else is a racket.
[03:45:37.447 --> 03:45:39.089]  It is organized crime.
[03:45:39.169 --> 03:45:40.050]  And he was exactly right.
[03:45:41.417 --> 03:45:44.319]  When we fight to defend our Constitution, we're fighting to defend our values.
[03:45:45.200 --> 03:45:46.221]  That is what nationalism is about.
[03:45:46.521 --> 03:45:49.584]  Patriotism is about fighting to defend your homeland.
[03:45:50.445 --> 03:45:59.252]  Nationalism is about fighting to defend your political system and the values embodied in that political and legal system in our Constitution.
[03:46:00.573 --> 03:46:03.776]  And if we had stuck to those values, we would have never been drawn into World War I.
[03:46:05.279 --> 03:46:11.657]  Maybe Emmanuel Macron should read the writing of our former president, James Madison, father of the Bill of Rights.
[03:46:12.379 --> 03:46:13.262]  He said throughout Europe.
[03:46:14.187 --> 03:46:19.749]  The army's kept under the pretext of defending an enslaved people.
[03:46:21.169 --> 03:46:27.911]  And quite frankly, that is the true purpose of Macron's EU army.
[03:46:28.251 --> 03:46:31.472]  He's not going to be putting that up there to protect them from foreign invasions.
[03:46:31.512 --> 03:46:33.352]  He's inviting the foreign invaders.
[03:46:34.353 --> 03:46:38.354]  The fifth column coming into the country.
[03:46:38.394 --> 03:46:39.334]  He's opened up the borders.
[03:46:39.374 --> 03:46:41.835]  He's part of the globalist open border cartel.
[03:46:43.585 --> 03:46:46.466]  He is not going to defend people.
[03:46:46.486 --> 03:46:51.248]  He's going to use the army to attack the people who object to that.
[03:46:51.288 --> 03:46:54.370]  To object to having their homes destroyed.
[03:46:54.470 --> 03:47:01.373]  Armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.
[03:47:05.915 --> 03:47:08.516]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.214 --> 03:47:24.937]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.338 --> 03:47:26.840]  Because there is a war on.
[03:47:27.261 --> 03:47:28.263]  For your mind.
[03:47:28.864 --> 03:47:30.787]  With Nick Begich.
[03:47:36.738 --> 03:47:39.319]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.359 --> 03:47:42.020]  This is Dr. Nick Vegas standing in in this fourth hour.
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:44.400]  I appreciate all of the listeners.
[03:47:44.420 --> 03:47:47.401]  I appreciate the guys in the booth keeping this thing moving along.
[03:47:47.681 --> 03:47:52.423]  And, you know, we've been covering a couple different concepts.
[03:47:52.463 --> 03:48:02.646]  You know, we were talking about mind control, talking a little bit about sort of what's been happening in Europe and how things are sort of being framed and pushed in a very specific direction.
[03:48:02.846 --> 03:48:02.926]  And
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:09.525]  Let's get back into sort of what's, you know, what is coming in my view.
[03:48:09.585 --> 03:48:12.808]  You know, first of all, we're going to have a new Congress in January.
[03:48:13.708 --> 03:48:17.631]  Whatever can be done between now and then by this lame duck Congress ought to get done.
[03:48:18.132 --> 03:48:20.234]  Call your congressman, call your U.S.
[03:48:20.274 --> 03:48:28.941]  Senator, ask them to engage the conservative agenda now while we still have a few months, a few weeks even, to get maybe some things done.
[03:48:30.022 --> 03:48:32.103]  We're going to go back into gridlock, I'm afraid.
[03:48:32.524 --> 03:48:34.846]  This is going to be bad news.
[03:48:36.127 --> 03:48:37.508]  It's going to create a lot of tension.
[03:48:37.868 --> 03:48:40.670]  We'll see who blinks first.
[03:48:41.111 --> 03:48:43.893]  I'm confident that conservatives will prevail in this.
[03:48:45.414 --> 03:48:49.478]  But we need to hold steady and we need to support this network at this particular time.
[03:48:50.803 --> 03:48:51.864]  InfoWars.com.
[03:48:52.444 --> 03:48:54.245]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:48:55.026 --> 03:48:56.427]  My books and videos are all there.
[03:48:57.027 --> 03:48:58.628]  There's the Mind Control book.
[03:48:58.688 --> 03:49:07.274]  There's Earth Rising, which deals with all the platform of various technologies that we've been talking over the weeks and in the past on this program.
[03:49:07.594 --> 03:49:08.295]  They're all there.
[03:49:08.535 --> 03:49:13.678]  And these were things that were predicted much, much before things actually emerged.
[03:49:13.718 --> 03:49:16.060]  There's hundreds and hundreds of sources cited there.
[03:49:16.821 --> 03:49:23.588]  Very important in terms of documenting the facts, something that Alex does carefully, I do very carefully.
[03:49:23.668 --> 03:49:33.639]  Most of the hosts, as you know, those who watch the show, you see the exhibits, you see the information, you see those feeds that actually document.
[03:49:34.079 --> 03:49:34.300]  All right.
[03:49:48.892 --> 03:49:54.794]  And the feedback that's now possible, the feedback is individually tailored for you.
[03:49:55.354 --> 03:49:56.655]  This is how Brexit worked.
[03:49:56.995 --> 03:49:58.656]  And this is how Trump actually won.
[03:49:59.676 --> 03:50:05.818]  Taking big data, they were able to deduce 36 profiles of personality.
[03:50:05.958 --> 03:50:11.501]  And within those profiles of personality, they were then able to target specific individuals.
[03:50:11.601 --> 03:50:12.701]  And let me give you some examples.
[03:50:13.201 --> 03:50:31.094]  If you could get 300 data points on an individual, you know, through the internet, what do they look at, what do they research, that kind of interactive feed, 300 data points give you as much information as if you had lived with that person for five years, in terms of how those programs work.
[03:50:31.574 --> 03:50:38.199]  If you could get 3,000 bits of information, which is relatively easy in today's world of Facebook and social media,
[03:50:39.396 --> 03:50:46.318]  3,000 data points get you the same information as someone who lived with you for 20 years.
[03:50:46.938 --> 03:50:51.639]  In fact, it can predict what you'll do better than you can.
[03:50:52.599 --> 03:50:57.480]  And so what they did with this big data is they targeted very specific groups.
[03:50:57.580 --> 03:51:03.702]  As an example, in the southeast, where black voters were expected to vote for Hillary,
[03:51:04.554 --> 03:51:07.395]  They knew, Trump people knew, they couldn't get those votes.
[03:51:07.475 --> 03:51:09.575]  But what they could do is neutralize those votes.
[03:51:09.736 --> 03:51:16.537]  And if those of you remember the ads that were running, there was police with black men on the ground and police dogs chewing on them.
[03:51:16.657 --> 03:51:21.019]  And in the background was Hillary's voice saying, we have to bring them to heel.
[03:51:21.099 --> 03:51:22.459]  We have to bring them to heel.
[03:51:22.899 --> 03:51:23.960]  And many will remember that.
[03:51:24.020 --> 03:51:26.900]  And she was commenting on inner city use in the big cities.
[03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:28.901]  But that ad neutralized
[03:51:29.641 --> 03:51:32.844]  Minority voters in the Southeast, they didn't go to the polls at all.
[03:51:32.984 --> 03:51:35.085]  They didn't vote for Trump, but they didn't vote for Hillary.
[03:51:35.626 --> 03:51:44.712]  This is the techniques that were used in the Trump run and also used in the Brexit exit, because they were able to target specific people.
[03:51:44.792 --> 03:51:51.677]  Now this can be used for you or against you, and this is the very important point in all of this, is data.
[03:51:51.777 --> 03:51:55.340]  The data that we give so freely through social media and other means.
[03:51:55.920 --> 03:51:58.762]  Are used specifically to target our views.
[03:51:58.822 --> 03:51:59.863]  So here's how it works.
[03:51:59.923 --> 03:52:05.687]  In the long run, what you're going to see more and more of is they're going to look at, say, 99 issues, right?
[03:52:05.827 --> 03:52:10.330]  And they're going to find out the one issue or the two issues that you agree with some candidate.
[03:52:11.050 --> 03:52:20.377]  And then what's going to happen is you're only going to get information coming into your data feeds about that candidate that you support.
[03:52:20.962 --> 03:52:28.884]  In other words, the other 97 issues that they are involved in that you would never support them on, you won't hear about unless you're dialing into other types of media.
[03:52:29.364 --> 03:52:42.407]  So this is again why it's important to always get a feed that you search out, and that is contrarian to who you are from time to time, so that you can disturb the data fields.
[03:52:42.447 --> 03:52:48.488]  In fact, I'd recommend that routinely people do a search in the absolute opposite direction of your normal nature.
[03:52:49.128 --> 03:52:51.071]  Do 10 searches in the wrong direction.
[03:52:51.851 --> 03:52:55.896]  Just so you screw up the programs that are being run against you.
[03:52:56.277 --> 03:53:01.062]  If people routinely do this, it will screw up their ability to predict and program.
[03:53:01.302 --> 03:53:02.364]  The same with polling.
[03:53:02.744 --> 03:53:03.565]  Forget the polling.
[03:53:04.166 --> 03:53:05.067]  Either don't do it,
[03:53:05.680 --> 03:53:19.169]  Or give them screwed up information so that polls, which are totally unreliable today politically, they are not worth anything anymore because you can't get a clear profile because of the way data is collected and it's so broken up.
[03:53:19.669 --> 03:53:21.170]  But we can disrupt.
[03:53:21.631 --> 03:53:23.832]  We can participate as disruptors.
[03:53:24.292 --> 03:53:25.373]  That's who we are.
[03:53:25.913 --> 03:53:28.855]  We are disrupting this social order that we don't believe in.
[03:53:29.496 --> 03:53:31.677]  We can look at data feeds and how we do this.
[03:53:31.697 --> 03:53:32.818]  Just do a couple of
[03:53:33.806 --> 03:53:34.287]  Thank you.
[03:53:53.436 --> 03:53:59.139]  To put a bicycle wrench in the bicycle spokes as a New World Order is riding down the hill.
[03:53:59.639 --> 03:54:00.779]  Those are simple things.
[03:54:01.300 --> 03:54:02.880]  The other is really even simpler.
[03:54:03.140 --> 03:54:04.221]  Turn off the TV.
[03:54:05.181 --> 03:54:06.322]  I mean it.
[03:54:06.402 --> 03:54:10.984]  Turn off the TV and then broaden your approach, but then be specific.
[03:54:11.798 --> 03:54:19.945]  Listen to the alternative medias, listen to those other ideas, and then engage in learning and educating yourself.
[03:54:20.445 --> 03:54:25.970]  Don't accept the data feed from the New World Order, which is the media of the 21st century.
[03:54:26.410 --> 03:54:30.133]  It has totally altered the way our society runs, the way our people function.
[03:54:30.574 --> 03:54:38.020]  This is working against our children and the successor generations that we, in this generation, have a responsibility to protect.
[03:54:38.540 --> 03:54:45.182]  And you know, when I think about this, liberal or conservative, one thing I know that we can all agree on, the children of the future we care about.
[03:54:45.703 --> 03:54:47.463]  We haven't met them yet, so we're not mad at them.
[03:54:48.683 --> 03:54:56.026]  Think about those unborn souls coming into this world, and what world will we leave them?
[03:54:57.105 --> 03:54:59.146]  We have the opportunity to continue to push.
[03:54:59.726 --> 03:55:03.687]  And I say to all of the listeners around the world, don't give up.
[03:55:03.927 --> 03:55:05.708]  Continue to push against your government.
[03:55:06.008 --> 03:55:19.332]  Continue to push against change that moves this not backwards, but forward into a life that recognizes those base values that in this part of the world were created over 200 years ago.
[03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:44.054]  By our founding fathers who recognized the sovereignty of the individual and the rights of individuals as we project into the world around us and our obligation and responsibilities to one another, both in terms of protecting our ability to speak freely, protecting our ability to practice our religions freely, to
[03:55:45.043 --> 03:55:48.764]  Our ability to influence and control the political outcomes of our governments.
[03:55:49.384 --> 03:55:55.105]  These are fundamental to who we are, not just as Americans, but as living souls on this planet.
[03:55:55.566 --> 03:56:04.968]  Taking our governments back, whether in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, or around the world, what's happening now is the beginning of the pushback.
[03:56:05.348 --> 03:56:07.088]  And we're all in the imperial war together.
[03:56:07.188 --> 03:56:09.669]  I want to remind people to support this network.
[03:56:10.450 --> 03:56:13.132]  Do the things that need to be done so we stay on the air.
[03:56:13.633 --> 03:56:18.838]  I keep forgetting, I never remember to mention my own website, but check out earthpulse.com.
[03:56:19.058 --> 03:56:22.882]  E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E, earthpulse.com.
[03:56:23.243 --> 03:56:26.366]  We have lots of things there that deal with the issues.
[03:56:26.386 --> 03:56:31.671]  We're talking about a lot of free information there as well, and we encourage you to access that and pass it on to others.
[03:56:32.772 --> 03:56:38.415]  And again, all of our stuff is offered through the InfoStore, and I really recommend that you do that.
[03:56:38.455 --> 03:56:40.076]  That gets us two bites of the apple.
[03:56:40.096 --> 03:56:45.959]  You support Alex, you support InfoWars, and you support the work that I'm doing around the world, and I appreciate it.
[03:56:47.059 --> 03:56:52.642]  You know, wrapping up this section, I want to talk about where do we go from here?
[03:56:52.822 --> 03:56:58.865]  In the Christmas season, you know, we think about the values, the Christian values that most Americans share.
[03:57:00.603 --> 03:57:12.249]  These are values of consideration, of kindness, of courtesy, of courage, the ability to step in and stand up when others are falling down.
[03:57:12.770 --> 03:57:13.770]  This is who we are.
[03:57:14.191 --> 03:57:15.511]  This is who Americans are.
[03:57:15.551 --> 03:57:16.912]  This is who we have always been.
[03:57:17.532 --> 03:57:19.734]  And one day we will see it come back.
[03:57:20.434 --> 03:57:22.135]  And the world is waiting for that day.
[03:57:22.927 --> 03:57:27.471]  Because the world recognizes that what comes out of this country has been good.
[03:57:27.571 --> 03:57:30.113]  It has changed the world and will continue to change the world.
[03:57:30.213 --> 03:57:36.018]  And together on InfoWars, we are changing that world, and we'll continue to change that world together.
[03:57:36.598 --> 03:57:38.700]  You're listening to Dr. Nick Veggage.
[03:57:38.760 --> 03:57:41.162]  This is the last segment of this Friday afternoon.
[03:57:41.682 --> 03:57:48.668]  We all appreciate you out there making InfoWars strong, supporting us, and helping us change the world together.
[03:57:52.099 --> 03:57:58.558]  In the last few months, InfoWars has been escalating our sales to clear out inventory of many of our best-selling items.
[03:58:00.270 --> 03:58:01.711]  And then I came up with the idea last week.
[03:58:01.951 --> 03:58:06.892]  Let's not just extend the sale of free shipping store-wide, 50-75% off, double Patriot points.
[03:58:08.053 --> 03:58:13.975]  Let's extend that sale, but also add a free gift with every order.
[03:58:14.755 --> 03:58:22.398]  Even if it's a tube of fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified, super blue, that we make like three bucks on at this sale, you'll get a free gift
[03:58:23.178 --> 03:58:49.347]  of a best-selling t-shirt while supplies last and what I mean by that is everyone will get a t-shirt but these are going to be selling out so whatever you order that day they'll be the shirt of the day that's there until it sells out then there'll be another shirt that goes up for the next order so in the next 12 days we are going to have beyond any other sale we've ever had the free gift so this is a loss leader
[03:58:50.586 --> 03:58:56.921]  We are losing money on this, but we're going to help fund ourselves because we won't get hit with the inventory taxes, federal and state.
[03:58:57.362 --> 03:58:59.106]  Everybody says Texas doesn't have income tax.
[03:58:59.186 --> 03:58:59.667]  I love my state.
