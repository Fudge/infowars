[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.630]  War on Corruption.
[00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.374]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:21.324 --> 00:00:28.129]  We know why InfoWars is being blocked and banned across the world by megacorporations.
[00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:32.000]  It's because InfoWars has studied their plan.
[00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:39.125]  And, you know, I wasn't sure if revelations in the Bible was accurate back when I was a kid.
[00:00:39.286 --> 00:00:41.847]  I believed in God, but that was a pretty wild story.
[00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:45.410]  But now, they're implementing it.
[00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:56.539]  They have major corporations working with the largest banks in the world on a rollout plan to basically make everyone have an implantable microchip in the hand.
[00:00:58.086 --> 00:00:59.147]  To buy and sell.
[00:00:59.187 --> 00:01:02.828]  But don't worry, there'll be a face scan as well.
[00:01:02.968 --> 00:01:04.729]  So it's the face and the hand.
[00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.171]  And the mark means a trademark or a digital code.
[00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:16.455]  The term mark means the specific mark of your ability to trade.
[00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:21.657]  2,000 years ago, a man on an island of Patmos had a vision.
[00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:26.900]  Talk about giant flying insects dropping
[00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:32.676]  Things that exploded into firebombs the size of mountains.
[00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:37.098]  You read all this, you're like, my God, was this guy a time traveler?
[00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:38.898]  What happened?
[00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.102]  Or are they taking these horrible ideas and using it like it's science fiction, but then the science fiction of Jules Verne's or H.G.
[00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:51.884]  Wells, it comes true later because what we envision, we're actually able to build.
[00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:55.593]  It's the previous, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:57.034]  God is real.
[00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:57.815]  The devil is real.
[00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.057]  This one-world government goes out of its way to do evil.
[00:02:00.997 --> 00:02:06.002]  And of course, Macron yesterday said nationalism is the great danger.
[00:02:06.723 --> 00:02:09.605]  He said patriotism is not caring about your nation.
[00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:12.107]  Now, that is total inversion.
[00:02:12.828 --> 00:02:14.450]  That's like saying the Grim Reaper is life.
[00:02:15.491 --> 00:02:16.271]  Or black is white.
[00:02:16.852 --> 00:02:18.013]  But that's what he did.
[00:02:18.713 --> 00:02:20.055]  He's waging war on
[00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:26.887]  Reality we have those clips and the media is all yes, it's true to be a patriot.
[00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:38.861]  You must hate your nation Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism total inversion Just like
[00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:58.504]  The undoctored video that everybody could see of what happened with Jim Acosta, they had every news channel and every late night so-called comic, they really just weaponized this info, hiding behind comedy, called for her to be fired and then said that we put out a doctored video.
[00:02:58.924 --> 00:03:00.105]  Which we didn't, we just zoomed in.
[00:03:00.685 --> 00:03:07.051]  But again, that's a doctored video we just tuned in that we showed TV viewers, somebody on the Donald Reddit.
[00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:10.900]  Put that together where Jim Acosta knocks her out.
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.261]  He didn't really do that.
[00:03:13.022 --> 00:03:13.662]  That's doctored.
[00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:17.845]  What we put out was zoomed in for clarity, which is the opposite of doctoring.
[00:03:17.905 --> 00:03:19.246]  That, on your screen, is doctoring.
[00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:24.430]  So, what's happening is, everything is about to emerge.
[00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:33.537]  There's a point in this technocracy, in this planetary operation, where they can't hide it anymore.
[00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:49.465]  And so instead of me going, oh look, everything I told you about 23 years ago has now come true, I'm going to change course with the broadcast, make a big announcement when we come back, a big announcement, that I've really been thinking about for months, but I've got to announce on air and then implement.
[00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:56.930]  And I was intending to do this the time Trump got elected, but I'm going to do this now because I'm going to go back to our roots.
[00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:01.614]  And our roots is telling you what's coming 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now.
[00:04:03.544 --> 00:04:06.248]  Because that's really what the globalists fear.
[00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:17.986]  My ability to research their own system and research their mindset and research what they're building and then give you a prime projection of where you and your family will be.
[00:04:19.122 --> 00:04:36.094]  If you do not try to be involved in your own destiny, because you're headed towards a fork in the road, and one allows incredible free destiny, the other is so nightmarish that I can hardly even force myself to look at the next level of this if we are unsuccessful.
[00:04:36.835 --> 00:04:43.700]  That's one reason I don't talk about this a lot is because it's, quite frankly, so horrifying that
[00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:51.084]  I have trouble speaking this into existence, but it is the enemy's plan, so I'm gonna have to go ahead and tell you.
[00:04:57.614 --> 00:04:58.754]  We've changed the world with your help.
[00:04:59.074 --> 00:05:00.315]  You've changed the world through us.
[00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:01.315]  We've changed it through you.
[00:05:01.335 --> 00:05:03.056]  I'm in your hands.
[00:05:03.176 --> 00:05:04.336]  InfoWars is in your hands.
[00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:05.216]  The world's in your hands.
[00:05:05.556 --> 00:05:07.737]  I've got really great products that everybody needs anyways.
[00:05:07.817 --> 00:05:08.997]  But we need your funding.
[00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:12.758]  We need money to do this and to continue to fight and hopefully expand.
[00:05:12.798 --> 00:05:14.679]  Because if you don't expand, you contract.
[00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:15.619]  There is no middle ground.
[00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.760]  I need everybody today to realize how real all this is.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.182]  I told you about the anti-fidoxy and going to the houses is the prelude.
[00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:23.163]  Ivan said they'll probably do it first with Tucker Carlson.
[00:05:23.183 --> 00:05:24.304]  I don't know how I know all this stuff.
[00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.486]  The point is, is that I need everybody to go.
[00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:28.147]  I really need a water filtration system.
[00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:32.730]  And Alex Jones sells the highest rated ones out there, and they're 49% off right now.
[00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.151]  I'm gonna get Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system.
[00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:37.853]  Or I'm gonna get X2, which is selling out.
[00:05:37.913 --> 00:05:38.534]  We have the new X3.
[00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:40.235]  People go, wait, X3 was a little bit weaker.
[00:05:40.355 --> 00:05:41.976]  Well, yeah, because it's got three types of iodine.
[00:05:42.076 --> 00:05:44.018]  So there's less of one and then more of the other two.
[00:05:44.278 --> 00:05:45.540]  It's cheaper to put one type in there.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.303]  It's better to put all three in tri-ionized.
[00:05:48.323 --> 00:05:48.643]  So X3.
[00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:50.205]  50% off as well.
[00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:51.126]  Free shipping storewide.
[00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.127]  Infowarshore.com.
[00:05:52.147 --> 00:05:53.369]  Without you, we won't be here.
[00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.069]  So please support us.
[00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:54.390]  Thank you.
[00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:15.003]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:36.768]  Well, it is now absolutely confirmed, not in triplicate, not in quadruplicate, but with hundreds of total confirmations, that the Democratic Party, run by a Soros-funded group, that's mainstream news, Miami Herald,
[00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:42.272]  ...is going to steal the governorship, the Senate seat, and a bunch of others.
[00:06:42.412 --> 00:06:46.653]  Anything that was close enough, within a couple points, they are going to steal everything on there.
[00:06:47.273 --> 00:06:48.694]  Doesn't matter what state law says.
[00:06:48.754 --> 00:06:51.354]  More trucks arrived Saturday, yesterday, today.
[00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:52.875]  They just pulled trucks in.
[00:06:53.335 --> 00:06:54.075]  Cops walk up.
[00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:55.175]  People unload them.
[00:06:55.195 --> 00:06:55.975]  They just say, get back.
[00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:57.356]  Doesn't matter what the governor says.
[00:06:57.376 --> 00:06:57.956]  We're taking them in.
[00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:02.490]  And then even inside they admit, yeah, these are provisional ballots, we're just filling it out however we want.
[00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:11.411]  And they're finding employees of the county that work for the Democrats are just randomly everywhere, just walking around with boxes out of their houses.
[00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.712]  Neighbors are videotaping it.
[00:07:12.972 --> 00:07:20.733]  People are leaving rental cars that are signed into the city and signed in to the Broward County Supervisors of Elections.
[00:07:21.373 --> 00:07:23.754]  And they're full of ballots and boxes.
[00:07:25.843 --> 00:07:27.124]  The remains of them show.
[00:07:27.164 --> 00:07:40.249]  There's a lot of busy beavering when you've got to basically fill out hundreds of thousands of fake ballots and then get those back to old Soros and his compatriots.
[00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:49.153]  And top election experts across the country are like, there's no doubt we've never seen it more naked except four other times in Broward County.
[00:07:50.013 --> 00:07:52.194]  And she's been found in court to steal elections.
[00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:54.475]  I mean, this is what she does.
[00:07:56.175 --> 00:07:59.917]  And so this is the raw exercise of power.
[00:08:01.578 --> 00:08:12.504]  And we as nationalists, we as patriots, we're faced with a criminal engine, a criminal army, who means business.
[00:08:13.664 --> 00:08:20.548]  And so we're gonna be getting into that coming up at the bottom of the hour and all the videos and all the proof and it's just mind-boggling.
[00:08:22.506 --> 00:08:25.248]  Governor ordered the ballots impounded that were already there.
[00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:26.648]  They don't listen to that.
[00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:28.309]  They don't listen to anybody.
[00:08:28.329 --> 00:08:29.910]  The state police say, we're not lifting a finger.
[00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.231]  We don't care what the governor says.
[00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:36.053]  We're going to follow the orders of Broward County Supervisors, Brenda Snipes.
[00:08:37.234 --> 00:08:41.957]  And so the governor just sits there with total Democrat mutiny, just like Trump does.
[00:08:42.697 --> 00:08:43.898]  And they just do whatever they want.
[00:08:45.739 --> 00:08:47.680]  So that's how the Democrats operate, folks.
[00:08:49.088 --> 00:08:56.336]  Just like Obama 8 years ago, a couple years ago his administration said, you know, I'm just saying we're going to let anybody in that can make it across the border.
[00:08:56.356 --> 00:09:00.201]  And we're going to load them on Democrat Party buses and ship them to God knows where.
[00:09:00.221 --> 00:09:02.784]  And a lot of them ended up getting killed or in sex slavery.
[00:09:03.184 --> 00:09:04.666]  Even the Washington Post admitted all that.
[00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.220]  But it doesn't matter, does it?
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.581]  Because they're in charge.
[00:09:09.142 --> 00:09:11.583]  They just break the law and do whatever they want.
[00:09:11.643 --> 00:09:16.948]  Along comes Trump and tries to actually do something about it and tries to actually not let the globalists sell the country out.
[00:09:16.988 --> 00:09:17.728]  He's the bad guy.
[00:09:18.089 --> 00:09:18.709]  He's the devil.
[00:09:18.729 --> 00:09:19.610]  He's got to be destroyed.
[00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.832]  Because all the late night shows say so.
[00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:27.055]  But here's the big news.
[00:09:27.996 --> 00:09:28.857]  Let me do it this way.
[00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.519]  Let me make the big announcement at the next segment.
[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.861]  So I want to think about how I'm going to say this.
[00:09:35.506 --> 00:09:38.209]  And it's mainly just not even a course correction for us.
[00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.532]  It's just something that everybody's been asking us to do.
[00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:43.274]  My family's been asking me to do it.
[00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.095]  And it's something I know I need to do.
[00:09:45.356 --> 00:09:50.641]  And it is a very, very painful to do.
[00:09:52.663 --> 00:09:58.969]  Because when I start looking into the future, if we don't really change course quickly,
[00:10:02.298 --> 00:10:04.819]  There's almost no point telling people that they're not going to do anything.
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:15.586]  Like, I'm getting to the point where I think people kind of deserve what they're going to get.
[00:10:21.189 --> 00:10:24.991]  And I just need to not even worry about present things.
[00:10:25.031 --> 00:10:28.073]  I need to worry about making sure that this is all on record.
[00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:43.796]  Before it all happens, show that when people are begging God to kill them, they will remember that they were told the truth so they can make the right spiritual decision, because that's what this is all about later.
[00:10:45.205 --> 00:11:01.469]  It'd be nice to save the country and it'd be nice to save the world and it'd be nice to turn things around and not have the brain chips and half the public having cancer and almost everyone being sterilized and total world government and by law you've got to give your three-year-old over to the local sex group to have sex with them.
[00:11:02.109 --> 00:11:03.109]  I mean that's what's all coming.
[00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.750]  But you know what?
[00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.791]  Everybody wants to follow this stuff and be politically correct?
[00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:09.191]  You're gonna get to.
[00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:19.061]  When they're done, they're going to be having sex with three-year-olds on stages at sports stadiums.
[00:11:20.362 --> 00:11:21.003]  I know their plan.
[00:11:23.365 --> 00:11:28.129]  And people say, wow, this is all outrageous, Jones, over and over again, but it all comes true, doesn't it?
[00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:30.010]  Because I'm dialed into their frequency.
[00:11:31.852 --> 00:11:37.016]  And the reason I don't get into what they're really going to do to you and your family is I don't like dialing into the frequency.
[00:11:39.058 --> 00:11:39.739]  But you know what?
[00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:40.639]  I'll do it, okay?
[00:11:41.755 --> 00:11:43.676]  And I think a lot of you can dial into the frequency.
[00:11:43.696 --> 00:11:48.880]  You can also just intellectually, historically, see where everything's going.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.064]  But let me tell you, if you think it's got a bottom to it, it ain't got no bottom.
[00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:02.028]  It doesn't have a bottom.
[00:12:15.586 --> 00:12:25.191]  So, we're rejecting God, and we're rejecting justice, and we're rejecting providence, and we're rejecting all that's good.
[00:12:28.753 --> 00:12:29.693]  And so there is no bottom.
[00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:37.097]  So I'll come back and get into all that as best I can, and then we'll get into the election fraud.
[00:12:37.637 --> 00:12:43.540]  And then when I get into all the world government, Mark of the Beast, technocracy stuff,
[00:12:46.104 --> 00:12:48.525]  In fact, guys, print me a Bloomberg article from like three years ago.
[00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:56.469]  At Davos, they held a vote, and they decided to call themselves a technocracy, and they said, we don't believe in elective governments.
[00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.791]  We believe in giant computers we program controlling you.
[00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:01.912]  With microchips.
[00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:06.094]  Then they had everybody from Bloomberg to Fox News say, yes, soon you'll all have chips.
[00:13:08.539 --> 00:13:10.500]  Jones and the Christians and people are crazy.
[00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.860]  There's never going to be a plan to put a microchip in you.
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.941]  There's never going to be face scanning to buy and sell.
[00:13:14.961 --> 00:13:17.822]  There's never going to be a world government and just shut up about it.
[00:13:18.542 --> 00:13:23.603]  I remember Fox News, CNN 15 years ago saying I was crazy 20 years ago.
[00:13:25.444 --> 00:13:27.124]  And now Fox News last week is.
[00:13:27.905 --> 00:13:29.725]  Of course everyone's going to have a chip.
[00:13:30.385 --> 00:13:35.727]  Get ready to get yours because to have a cell phone or to get on the internet or to have a job you're going to have to.
[00:13:36.892 --> 00:13:40.233]  And people don't go, oh my God, it's the Mark of the Beast, or even don't believe in God.
[00:13:40.673 --> 00:13:43.054]  People don't go, man, that'll really be used to abuse people.
[00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:48.937]  With a global social score, that we first told you about six years ago.
[00:13:50.998 --> 00:13:52.858]  No, they just go, okay, I'll do it.
[00:13:53.739 --> 00:13:55.859]  And then, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.220]  Until, we're gonna sterilize you now, okay.
[00:13:59.081 --> 00:14:00.461]  We're gonna wipe your memories now, okay.
[00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:02.662]  You have to worship this God, okay.
[00:14:02.682 --> 00:14:04.503]  You have to give us your kids, okay.
[00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:06.897]  Yep, totally submit to us.
[00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:08.639]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:12.362]  Okay, now we're going to get rid of your body, but your soul will be stored in this computer.
[00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:13.624]  So you go to this center.
[00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:14.524]  It's a quick process.
[00:14:14.785 --> 00:14:16.066]  Your family will still be able to talk to you.
[00:14:16.086 --> 00:14:20.951]  You're going to live forever once you're uploaded into this computer, but really it'll be a facsimile and you'll be dead.
[00:14:22.628 --> 00:14:24.529]  Yo ass gonna be dead.
[00:14:24.889 --> 00:14:26.250]  They gonna kill yo ass.
[00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.250]  I told people this 20 years ago.
[00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.671]  I could envision the enemy operation.
[00:14:29.951 --> 00:14:43.877]  Now this year the transhumanists are everywhere saying to live forever you're gonna die by global government law and you will be uploaded into the machine and your family will be able to talk to you there'll be a hologram of you and your hologram will be able to
[00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:45.603]  Get into an avatar?
[00:14:46.003 --> 00:14:47.384]  It's not gonna be Daddy.
[00:14:48.125 --> 00:14:49.366]  It's not gonna be Mommy.
[00:14:49.726 --> 00:14:51.087]  It's not gonna be Grandpa.
[00:14:51.267 --> 00:14:52.288]  It's not gonna be your son.
[00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.509]  It's not gonna be your daughter.
[00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.193]  It's going to be the AI posing as your family member.
[00:14:59.594 --> 00:15:07.941]  And by the time it's ready for you to make the transition... By the time it's time for you to take the transition, everybody's doing it.
[00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:12.605]  It'll be all over the so-called news that's beamed directly to your head.
[00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:12.705]  That...
[00:15:15.404 --> 00:15:16.484]  You know, look at Bob.
[00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:19.386]  He's 120, but he's out skiing in his new body.
[00:15:19.786 --> 00:15:20.706]  You can have a metal body.
[00:15:20.746 --> 00:15:21.667]  You can have a plastic body.
[00:15:21.687 --> 00:15:29.410]  You can have a humanoid grown for you in one of the great tanks in China's global Apple distributors' master class system.
[00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.231]  A whole new rollout of services for all of you.
[00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:36.253]  But we've just got to get past those Christians that warned 2,000 years ago it was coming.
[00:15:36.753 --> 00:15:40.515]  And once they're out of the way, we can enter the brave new world.
[00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:46.719]  A brave new world where you'll be so toxic and so poisoned, you've got to transition to even live.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.563]  But you won't really live, you'll die.
[00:15:49.003 --> 00:15:52.690]  But in your free will, you will accept merging with the machine.
[00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:54.894]  And your soul will be destroyed.

[00:17:01.229 --> 00:17:06.493]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[00:17:07.514 --> 00:17:14.379]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:17.101]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:17:17.742 --> 00:17:18.603]  I want to keep going.
[00:17:18.623 --> 00:17:22.946]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:25.007]  I want to push all the way.
[00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:26.888]  I've committed to do that.
[00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:27.848]  I've prayed for that.
[00:17:28.409 --> 00:17:30.009]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:33.050]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.370]  I will give the total sacrifice.
[00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.051]  I will never falter.
[00:17:38.071 --> 00:17:40.691]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:17:40.971 --> 00:17:41.671]  I physically will.
[00:17:42.112 --> 00:17:48.873]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, at FullMoreStore.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:09.075]  If the Deep State and Robert Mueller and his allies now in the Democratic House succeed in destroying me, who will be next?
[00:18:09.555 --> 00:18:16.539]  You see, I've been targeted because I stood up for America, because I stood up for our president and his reform agenda.
[00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:19.761]  And now I have no choice but to appeal to you.
[00:18:20.681 --> 00:18:27.403]  I am very grateful to all those Americans who have stepped forward to help me so far in this extraordinary legal struggle.
[00:18:27.723 --> 00:18:30.264]  But now I need your help as never before.
[00:18:30.704 --> 00:18:33.544]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:18:33.864 --> 00:18:35.525]  Help me stand up for America.

[00:19:59.506 --> 00:20:03.707]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:21.572]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:22.312 --> 00:20:23.812]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:24.253 --> 00:20:25.373]  Longing for the sun.
[00:20:47.615 --> 00:20:48.936]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:49.056 --> 00:20:50.436]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:50.476 --> 00:20:57.018]  It is the 12th day of November 2018, on this Monday.
[00:20:57.038 --> 00:21:00.119]  Alright, so here's the course correction.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.840]  And it's not a course correction at all.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.581]  It's actually continuing on our mission.
[00:21:06.442 --> 00:21:08.482]  I will continue to support President Trump.
[00:21:09.243 --> 00:21:12.724]  I will continue to support nationalist and populist movements around the world.
[00:21:14.226 --> 00:21:36.412]  But trying to dodge a bullet, trying to get Trump in and other nationalists in, and trying to win things like these midterms is a pipe dream if you don't fundamentally address the globalists, the world government, the technocrats, and what their endgame is.
[00:21:37.483 --> 00:21:45.909]  Remember, oh, there isn't a world government, there isn't an EU empire plan, we're not going after nation states, we're not going after your family, the Federal Reserve's not private.
[00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:53.215]  Now, the Federal Reserve's private, families are bad, we're going to have a world government empire run out of the EU, you're going to have a microchip to buy and sell.
[00:21:54.616 --> 00:21:55.456]  And Christians are the enemy.
[00:21:57.478 --> 00:22:01.461]  That's all in the news today, from world leaders.
[00:22:04.963 --> 00:22:07.005]  You see, they've got a plan.
[00:22:07.105 --> 00:22:08.947]  They're following a blueprint.
[00:22:09.067 --> 00:22:12.531]  They're following a architecture diagram.
[00:22:15.775 --> 00:22:18.297]  First they tell you that humans don't have a soul.
[00:22:18.358 --> 00:22:19.579]  Humans don't even have free will.
[00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:22.422]  They've been teaching that for a hundred years in the colleges.
[00:22:23.323 --> 00:22:25.826]  So you just go ahead and be sociopathic and just do whatever you want.
[00:22:26.647 --> 00:22:31.189]  But first you signal all day to people that do have consciences and control them that way.
[00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:33.490]  We're going to teach you how to really be professional.
[00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:34.810]  How to be a technocrat.
[00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:41.112]  How to make sure you don't have that fake thing that holds you back called a soul.
[00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:43.653]  We're going to teach you how to be superior.
[00:22:44.374 --> 00:22:47.575]  And then you can sit in the seats of power once you're a good robot.
[00:22:47.615 --> 00:22:52.837]  But you're not really a robot, you're a devil that likes to hurt people.
[00:22:53.902 --> 00:22:58.083]  You've now stepped into it by increment, you've turned your will over, you're under a spell.
[00:23:00.123 --> 00:23:20.107]  And now you can try to put other people into the mindset, into the groove, so that they can stay asleep, asleep, and be tricked in the nightmare to go deeper down the rattle, deeper into the abyss, as you fall, fall, fall, fall through eternity away from God.
[00:23:26.266 --> 00:23:28.928]  And so, the change of course is this.
[00:23:32.491 --> 00:23:44.941]  Because Trump is lied about, because you get demonized if you stand up for Trump, because you get persecuted if you stand up for Trump, because he is good, he is pragmatic, he does want nation states, he wants a pro-human future.
[00:23:45.661 --> 00:23:47.603]  That's his big sin, is he likes people.
[00:23:48.183 --> 00:23:48.764]  And he's strong.
[00:23:50.245 --> 00:23:51.085]  He's not satanic.
[00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.168]  And because of that,
[00:23:55.507 --> 00:23:59.651]  I totally defend him because I'm going to go where the heat is.
[00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:01.733]  I'm going to go where the target is.
[00:24:02.334 --> 00:24:04.656]  I'm going to go where the flack is.
[00:24:06.899 --> 00:24:07.519]  And I've done that.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.521]  And I'm going to continue to do that.
[00:24:10.845 --> 00:24:14.869]  Most importantly is exposing the big game, the big plan.
[00:24:15.469 --> 00:24:27.119]  Like we did about world government and cashless societies and the attack on the family and all the other things we broke down that the surveillance grid right down to how it works specifically 20 years ago from NSA whistleblowers.
[00:24:32.144 --> 00:24:34.746]  That's really what's important is to do professional
[00:24:36.263 --> 00:24:39.644]  Almost PragerU style videos, which I used to do years ago.
[00:24:39.684 --> 00:24:40.444]  We still do some of them.
[00:24:40.844 --> 00:24:51.226]  And films, and things like that, where we really walk someone through the globalist's own admissions and own statements where I'm not even in it.
[00:24:53.786 --> 00:24:59.167]  That's really what I've been envisioning for years, is moving forward to do things like that.
[00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:01.147]  And the globalists know that.
[00:25:01.487 --> 00:25:05.528]  That's why they want to shut down now before we're able to get to that point.
[00:25:07.864 --> 00:25:14.689]  Because the credibility we have, that so much of what we've said has come true, they can't allow us to be here.
[00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:29.339]  So they have to build a strongman and assassinate my character and my name, and try to financially destroy us, because they don't want anybody else to look at what InfoWars has done, and this is central, and say, wow, for the middle of nowhere Texas,
[00:25:30.347 --> 00:25:43.432]  Standing up, rebooting Americana, relaunching a belief in humans, and a human future, and the family, and capitalism, and private property, which is a foundation in a Christian society for a free society.
[00:25:44.393 --> 00:25:47.714]  So I'm relaunching the opposite of what the globalists want.
[00:25:47.734 --> 00:25:52.056]  They want monopolies, they want the occult, they want broken families, they want control.
[00:25:52.796 --> 00:25:54.097]  They want sabotage systems.
[00:25:55.871 --> 00:25:58.052]  So they can rebuild it in whatever horrid image they want.
[00:25:58.573 --> 00:26:02.915]  It's an act of total vandalism, an act of total cowardice, an act of complete selfishness.
[00:26:05.897 --> 00:26:07.197]  And so that's where we stand here.
[00:26:10.019 --> 00:26:20.945]  That it is most important that we make the next group of predictions.
[00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:26.053]  And then when I make those predictions, everyone will say, oh, I saw that on Netflix, I read that in a book.
[00:26:26.433 --> 00:26:27.773]  That's a thousand years from now.
[00:26:27.793 --> 00:26:29.494]  We're talking about that exact thing.
[00:26:29.534 --> 00:26:33.894]  No, that's predictive programming to get you ready to make you comfortable with it.
[00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:45.977]  Even if it's put in a dystopic format, your brain will adapt and overcome and prepare yourself to live in the scenario it's envisioning and will start making preparations.
[00:26:46.257 --> 00:26:50.198]  All the globalists incrementally, culturally make preparations to insert you into it.
[00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:59.029]  So when we come back, I'll get into how they plan to get you and your family to not just take chips in the hand, but chips in the brain.
[00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:06.093]  And then we'll leap forward and look at the world in 20 years according to their plan.
[00:27:07.193 --> 00:27:11.496]  And then I'll get into the current election stealing, and we'll get into all the other news.
[00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:18.199]  But the course change here, the course change here is that
[00:27:22.006 --> 00:27:32.051]  I have been very politico because I saw a true Americana movement, and one that's very successful in moving forward, being attacked, and the enemy was very, very threatened by it.
[00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:36.951]  And that's a good thing that we backed it, and it's stronger than ever.
[00:27:37.331 --> 00:27:48.494]  But we have to be multifaceted and get back to the actual architecture of the globalists themselves, and not even make it about Trump or even the nation-state, but make it about good and evil, the technocracy versus free will.
[00:27:49.054 --> 00:27:52.755]  The electronic prison versus the universe that's laying out right before you.
[00:27:54.036 --> 00:27:59.461]  We're going to go to break, we're going to come back, and I will get into all of this, but this is the reason they want to shut down.
[00:27:59.481 --> 00:28:03.704]  There are a billion voices out there, and a million leaders, and all the rest of it, and that's great.
[00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:04.966]  I'm not trying to be the leader.
[00:28:05.806 --> 00:28:10.871]  I'm just telling them, you're going to get here what's actually going on, from the enemy's perspective.
[00:28:12.192 --> 00:28:14.054]  I'm in their head, they're in my head, they know it.
[00:28:15.171 --> 00:28:16.992]  And I'm willing to dial into their frequency.
[00:28:17.693 --> 00:28:18.393]  It is not fun.
[00:28:18.413 --> 00:28:20.014]  I mean, let me tell you, it's not fun.
[00:28:20.495 --> 00:28:24.717]  But I'm willing to do it, and they want me shut down because they know I'm in the room with them.
[00:28:25.177 --> 00:28:25.418]  Right now.
[00:28:28.675 --> 00:28:30.997]  So, we'll break it all down when we come back.
[00:28:31.017 --> 00:28:32.179]  It's a spiritual fight, though.
[00:28:32.719 --> 00:28:39.646]  They're building this big glittery matrix to try to insert you into it, to trick you in it, to give up your soul and your free will.
[00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:45.812]  You have free will, you're made in the image of God, you're amazing, you have the entire potential of the universe in you.
[00:28:46.313 --> 00:28:48.755]  Don't let them steal it from you.
[00:28:49.416 --> 00:28:52.419]  Don't sell your soul for all this tinfoil crap.
[00:28:57.611 --> 00:29:01.432]  Fort Worthians woke up this morning to terrible, horrible Nazi evil.
[00:29:01.932 --> 00:29:03.633]  That white people are okay.
[00:29:03.753 --> 00:29:05.573]  Huge article, Infowars.com.
[00:29:05.733 --> 00:29:08.694]  It's okay to be white signs pop up in Fort Worth neighborhood.
[00:29:08.954 --> 00:29:12.976]  Origin of the signs and the intended meaning of the words a mystery.
[00:29:13.116 --> 00:29:14.136]  Hundreds of articles a day.
[00:29:14.196 --> 00:29:15.476]  New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:29:15.516 --> 00:29:16.397]  The white problem.
[00:29:16.577 --> 00:29:17.017]  Opinion.
[00:29:17.057 --> 00:29:17.977]  Can we replace them?
[00:29:18.117 --> 00:29:18.817]  New York Times.
[00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:19.518]  Bill Kristol.
[00:29:19.538 --> 00:29:20.678]  Lazy white working class.
[00:29:20.698 --> 00:29:21.138]  The problem.
[00:29:21.158 --> 00:29:21.878]  We need to replace him.
[00:29:21.918 --> 00:29:22.539]  New York Times.
[00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:23.899]  Replacing white people.
[00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:24.659]  The key.
[00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:26.220]  How can I cure my white guilt?
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:26.880]  Get rid of whites.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:27.400]  New York Times.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:29.061]  People are like, hey, it's okay to be white.
[00:29:29.101 --> 00:29:37.724]  Here is the leftist race-baiting orgy with a bunch of virtue-signaling white people falling over themselves to fall off a rhetorical cliff.
[00:29:37.984 --> 00:29:44.673]  Owners in one north Fort Worth neighborhood woke up to an unsettling sight and now they can't figure out if it was a prank or something more.
[00:29:56.428 --> 00:30:03.211]  To cause a debate that you people are an anti-white cult, and we've all just accepted this super-Hitlerian, anti-Martin Luther King garbage?
[00:30:03.231 --> 00:30:07.233]  The neighborhood seemed to have been tagged with handfuls of signs printed on paper.
[00:30:07.273 --> 00:30:10.275]  Those signs read, it's okay to be white.
[00:30:10.335 --> 00:30:11.535]  That's what was printed on them.
[00:30:11.555 --> 00:30:13.136]  But no one knows who put them up.
[00:30:13.736 --> 00:30:14.637]  Somebody tell Don Lemon.
[00:30:14.697 --> 00:30:18.681]  Here's what it looked like along Waverly Lane in North Fort Worth early Thursday morning.
[00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:26.708]  Cell phone video and pictures taken of the area show the signs reading, it's okay to be white, posted onto lampposts and other pieces of public property.
[00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:32.673]  By the time we got there, all of the signs except for this one were gone, but it didn't stay up too much longer.
[00:30:32.693 --> 00:30:33.113]  Oh good.
[00:30:33.133 --> 00:30:37.017]  Don Lemon Lab is white and is only for the good in this neighborhood.
[00:30:38.157 --> 00:30:38.778]  Yay!
[00:30:38.838 --> 00:30:39.939]  Get rid of free speech!
[00:30:39.999 --> 00:30:40.079]  Yay!
[00:30:45.754 --> 00:30:47.415]  And I don't care what color you are.
[00:30:47.975 --> 00:30:49.695]  I don't care what religion you are.
[00:30:49.735 --> 00:30:50.976]  But it's not okay to be white.
[00:30:51.076 --> 00:30:53.436]  I don't care what your economic status is.
[00:30:54.297 --> 00:30:56.157]  You judge people by how they act.
[00:30:56.657 --> 00:31:01.459]  What no one seems to be able to answer is who put them up and what exactly was the intention of the message.
[00:31:01.479 --> 00:31:02.419]  Martin Luther King said that.
[00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:03.280]  That's how brainwashed she is.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:07.981]  She pulls them down because lately everywhere the corporate media is saying whites are inherently evil.
[00:31:08.301 --> 00:31:13.703]  It's literally Hitler stuff upside down run by the New York Times and Carlos Slim.
[00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:17.166]  Let's just pull this sign down right here.
[00:31:17.286 --> 00:31:18.147]  What the hell?
[00:31:18.167 --> 00:31:20.249]  Do you think this is America?
[00:31:20.409 --> 00:31:23.012]  White people are not okay.
[00:31:23.232 --> 00:31:25.014]  Is that clear, boy?
[00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:25.995]  Look at her.
[00:31:26.015 --> 00:31:27.216]  She'll show your ass.
[00:31:27.276 --> 00:31:27.677]  Look at that.
[00:31:27.797 --> 00:31:30.539]  I guess she kind of gets that gunslinger stance after she pulls it down.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.100]  She can't relate.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:32.281]  She's like, yeah, why?
[00:31:32.642 --> 00:31:34.063]  I'm a good person.
[00:31:34.463 --> 00:31:37.827]  First Amendment, wipe my big old butt with that right now.
[00:31:48.126 --> 00:31:50.188]  Call the police immediately!
[00:31:50.588 --> 00:31:53.471]  We got people exercising free speech right here.
[00:31:55.752 --> 00:32:03.759]  ExtendoWise, the latest product from Infowarsline.com, fuses all the known compounds that have been proven to be good for our hearts and cardiovascular system.

[00:32:59.122 --> 00:33:05.364]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:21.868]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.429 --> 00:33:27.490]  So imagine we're a ship out in the sea, or a ship flying to a distant star system.
[00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:41.306]  And we're on an original course, but we deviate off that course on the mission because there's a place we want to vision.
[00:33:41.786 --> 00:33:47.311]  There's something we want to do that actually may help us get where we're going quicker and safer and better.
[00:33:48.612 --> 00:33:55.798]  And that's nationalism, that's patriotism, that's rebooting the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, returning national sovereignty.
[00:33:56.957 --> 00:34:10.368]  Because the global government wants to get rid of nations, it wants to get rid of people having any type of political system that speaks for them that could challenge the illegitimate dictatorial authority of the global corporatist crony state.
[00:34:11.809 --> 00:34:15.352]  And that's why Macron and others are openly attacking the existence of a nation.
[00:34:15.372 --> 00:34:16.853]  We're going to get to that in a few minutes.
[00:34:19.155 --> 00:34:21.497]  So when I say Infowars is setting a new course,
[00:34:22.833 --> 00:34:46.051]  I'm saying we're getting back on our original course in that I've gotten so into the minutiae of the daily news and so into the minutiae of defending Trump and other nationalists when people lie about them that the establishment and the controlled corporate media is able to trick us to make them irrelevant again by doing outrageous things and telling outrageous lies.
[00:34:46.632 --> 00:34:50.334]  And at a certain point if Jim Acosta says Trump took out the Martin Luther King bust
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.341]  Or didn't visit congressman's police in the hospital.
[00:34:53.361 --> 00:34:56.662]  At a certain point we gotta go, that's a liar, I'm not even responding.
[00:34:58.222 --> 00:34:59.783]  And I know it's too hard, we have to respond.
[00:34:59.823 --> 00:35:08.485]  But that's a tactic of them getting more and more outrageous to lure and to suck us back in.
[00:35:09.706 --> 00:35:13.047]  So when I say I'm getting back on our original course, I'm bigger for Trump than ever.
[00:35:14.232 --> 00:35:20.936]  And especially when people tell me don't do it, and I get persecuted for it, and we see the country coming back from the dead, and people would listen to Trump and other nationalists.
[00:35:21.376 --> 00:35:22.857]  We'd have a lot better future for humanity.
[00:35:23.817 --> 00:35:48.473]  But if we just let the globalists make Trump the issue, instead of the IMF, the World Bank, the Communist Chinese, the Davos Group calling for a planetary technocracy and a dictatorship, if we don't spend time going after them on the offense, and instead are defending that Trump's really good, and Alex Jones is really good, and that video of Acosta's real, when it's obviously real, we didn't doctor it,
[00:35:49.193 --> 00:35:55.283]  It becomes this system where they are able to change the subject off of the really bad stuff they're doing.
[00:35:58.308 --> 00:35:59.931]  So I never really changed course.
[00:36:01.101 --> 00:36:06.805]  I just understand I need to drill into the actual documents of what fluoride does to your brain and your body.
[00:36:07.086 --> 00:36:12.149]  I need to drill into the actual documents of what G5 and other wireless systems are doing on record.
[00:36:12.209 --> 00:36:25.499]  I need to expose the technocracy AI takeover plan and how it's making people obsolete and literally making us obsolete because it turns us into jellyfish where everything's handled for us like we're on some cruise ship in the movie WALL-E.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.722]  But the globalists never plan to let us get to that level.
[00:36:30.026 --> 00:36:33.347]  We're only having everything done for us because they're preparing to remove us.
[00:36:33.627 --> 00:36:40.830]  And that really is the big issue here that is so incredible, it boggles the mind.
[00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.932]  Now, I always prove everything I say.
[00:36:47.952 --> 00:36:56.295]  And it becomes a little neurotic that I'm sitting here wanting to get into the EU and the World Government Plan and the rest of it.
[00:36:57.284 --> 00:37:03.468]  And then here I am getting all the documents and all the articles together to prove what I've been saying for 20 years that's now come true.
[00:37:03.848 --> 00:37:05.730]  What's the point of proving what's already been proven to be true?
[00:37:06.670 --> 00:37:08.852]  But it is what I'm going to do.
[00:37:11.013 --> 00:37:22.101]  Because when you see what Macron said, and you see our own media, our own enemy media, the globalist media, they are the enemies.
[00:37:25.416 --> 00:37:26.056]  of prosperity.
[00:37:26.076 --> 00:37:31.560]  They are the enemies of us controlling our own destinies and that's just a fact.
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:37.044]  And Trump would be a liar if he came out and didn't say anything else.
[00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:45.669]  And so of course we're talking about congressional investigations into his war on the press.
[00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:50.973]  CNN, MSNBC and the New York Times are at war with the press and free speech.
[00:37:52.053 --> 00:37:52.494]  Obama
[00:37:53.419 --> 00:38:00.672]  Arrested hundreds of reporters, unlike any other president ever, who would expose criminal things he was doing.
[00:38:00.892 --> 00:38:02.455]  He went after whistleblowers, you name it.
[00:38:02.735 --> 00:38:03.637]  It was a reign of terror.
[00:38:03.937 --> 00:38:06.522]  Trump's done nothing like that.
[00:38:06.842 --> 00:38:07.183]  Zero.
[00:38:08.933 --> 00:38:28.387]  But they turn him into the authoritarian when it's CNN lobbying to not have my books published, harassing my sponsors, getting us taken off platforms and celebrating it, and then they file a lawsuit saying Trump is a dictator because he won't let Jim Acosta scream three questions at him and manhandle a woman.
[00:38:42.304 --> 00:38:45.807]  We have to really get people to understand the average Trump supporter.
[00:38:46.107 --> 00:38:47.188]  It's great to go to a Trump rally.
[00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:50.531]  But you're really being contained there.
[00:38:51.832 --> 00:38:53.974]  You should be going to your city council and your church.
[00:38:54.034 --> 00:38:55.396]  You should really be warning people.
[00:38:56.516 --> 00:38:58.298]  And you should be really involved in your community.
[00:38:59.499 --> 00:39:01.541]  Actually exposing the big picture.
[00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:12.882]  You know, when Trump had the rallies coupled with the internet, and coupled with his supporters and nationalists spreading the word, it was an unstoppable force, globally.
[00:39:14.622 --> 00:39:20.884]  But with the censorship coming in on a planetary scale, we must do several things.
[00:39:21.305 --> 00:39:28.167]  Lobby Trump, put pressure on Trump, give Trump support, and other nationalists to go after the censors.
[00:39:30.728 --> 00:39:34.089]  But we can't just sit there and count on Trump, is what I'm saying.
[00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.552]  to get it all done for us.
[00:39:40.732 --> 00:39:42.174]  We have to do it.
[00:39:42.714 --> 00:39:44.075]  It isn't vote every two years.
[00:39:44.135 --> 00:39:47.098]  It isn't, you know, just talk to your buddies around the dinner table.
[00:39:47.438 --> 00:39:57.847]  We have to decide that we really care about our children and their children's future and that we don't want to be in a electronic matrix that is literally being built for us.
[00:39:58.547 --> 00:39:59.428]  And that's what I'm getting at here.
[00:40:01.994 --> 00:40:03.194]  So I haven't got to any clips yet.
[00:40:03.254 --> 00:40:11.897]  We'll come back and get to all the world government clips and the Mark of the Beast clips and plan unveiled to microchip hundreds of thousands of UK employees at major companies.
[00:40:13.237 --> 00:40:19.238]  The London Guardian, you know, says insiders are totally freaked out that the big banks are rolling ahead with a plan.
[00:40:19.258 --> 00:40:21.339]  And after that, they're going to implant customers.
[00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:23.439]  That's just the beginning.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:27.260]  So it's all, it's all here.
[00:40:28.861 --> 00:40:29.601]  It's all happening.
[00:40:32.875 --> 00:40:38.798]  And you look at some place like Venezuela, or somewhere else that's totally collapsed, and you say, why is it collapsed?
[00:40:38.818 --> 00:40:40.559]  You know, communists can't manage anything.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.041]  It's a spirit.
[00:40:44.361 --> 00:40:48.804]  It's meant to create poverty and death and collapse and sewage running down the streets.
[00:40:48.904 --> 00:40:49.464]  It's death.
[00:40:52.906 --> 00:40:53.966]  That's what they want.
[00:40:56.688 --> 00:40:58.229]  It's what they do on purpose.
[00:41:02.639 --> 00:41:10.764]  Globalism, communism, all these systems are false paradigms that the globalists set offshore in control that are meant to render you down.
[00:41:11.244 --> 00:41:18.328]  They're meant to suck your culture out and destroy you ahead of the digital takeover.
[00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:22.271]  That's what world government is.
[00:41:22.311 --> 00:41:24.392]  It's what liberalism is in the modern sense.
[00:41:24.692 --> 00:41:28.294]  The modern leftist movement is about having no culture.
[00:41:29.075 --> 00:41:32.317]  It's about being a horrible, little, wicked, twisted person.
[00:41:34.855 --> 00:41:35.535]  We're going to go to break.
[00:41:36.056 --> 00:41:48.024]  Please also remember that it is you, the listener, and you, the viewer, that holds InfoWars in your hands as we stand against the globalists, and the Mark of the Beast, and the world government, and Hillary, and all the rest of it.
[00:41:48.164 --> 00:41:52.847]  You know, we told you Hillary was going to be running for president again a couple months ago.
[00:41:52.867 --> 00:41:57.670]  I learned this from the people that guard her, okay?
[00:41:58.651 --> 00:41:59.111]  And others.
[00:42:00.765 --> 00:42:07.589]  And then I heard about it later from some folks who are, let's just say, looking into things she's up to.
[00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:09.831]  And they said, yeah, it's crazy.
[00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:10.451]  It's official.
[00:42:10.811 --> 00:42:12.572]  They've told other Democrats, sit down and shut up.
[00:42:13.213 --> 00:42:14.954]  You might run, but no, you're going to stand down.
[00:42:14.974 --> 00:42:16.335]  We're going to take your delegates regardless.
[00:42:16.835 --> 00:42:19.477]  It's Hillary Rodham Clinton and Michelle Obama.
[00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:20.257]  It's done.
[00:42:20.918 --> 00:42:21.458]  It's done.
[00:42:23.473 --> 00:42:28.414]  I mean, don't tell me they're slick enough to have people in the room outside while those two are meeting and people overhear this.
[00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:30.454]  This is currently the plan.
[00:42:30.974 --> 00:42:32.275]  Now, you see it all over the news now.
[00:42:32.715 --> 00:42:34.015]  You think I just got up here and said that?
[00:42:36.195 --> 00:42:49.138]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, 67% off InfoWars mega total blowout sale, 67 to 49% off our best-selling items, select items.
[00:42:49.558 --> 00:42:50.858]  Without you funding us, we're gone.
[00:42:50.918 --> 00:42:51.318]  Stay with us.
[00:42:56.046 --> 00:42:57.387]  My message to the president is this.
[00:42:58.028 --> 00:42:58.648]  I respect you.
[00:42:58.668 --> 00:43:03.031]  You've done incredible work despite all these balls and chains tied around your ankles.
[00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:14.038]  But if you don't get these people off your back, and these corrupt mobsters and these criminals that have blocked America's recovery, then you become someone aiding and abetting the system, and I can only believe they've gotten to you.
[00:43:14.499 --> 00:43:25.346]  So in the next chapter, get ready, because the Republicans better get off their asses and take action to defend this country, or they are going to be seen as part of the problem.
[00:43:28.447 --> 00:43:38.810]  It is only the development and the advent of a robust alternative media based in the Internet that allowed for your election, Mr. President.
[00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:45.852]  You out-communicated the networks and the mainstream media through the Internet.
[00:43:46.052 --> 00:43:47.312]  That's how you won.
[00:43:47.612 --> 00:43:49.133]  And you were a master at it.
[00:43:49.813 --> 00:43:54.956]  Now they want to put the toothpaste back in the tube, and you've seen the impact in this election.
[00:43:55.556 --> 00:44:05.982]  Allowing the Democrats to take control of Facebook, which is the single most important effective tool in a local congressional race, was a death wish.
[00:44:06.603 --> 00:44:09.684]  Where was the complaint from the Republican National Committee?
[00:44:09.965 --> 00:44:13.727]  Which, sir, you controlled, and you could have made happen.
[00:44:13.907 --> 00:44:15.408]  And they thought you were so ignorant,
[00:44:15.928 --> 00:44:16.928]  We're good to go.
[00:44:36.574 --> 00:44:48.597]  Let's be clear, it's not just the right thing to do, it's also a way to change the narrative from the squeamish, anemic victory the Democrats just had, thanks to Republican ineptness.
[00:45:02.041 --> 00:45:04.942]  He needs to, tomorrow, fire them to change the narrative.
[00:45:04.962 --> 00:45:13.246]  Having tasted this narrow victory tonight, the Democrats will, and their tech giant allies, will push internet censorship even further.
[00:45:13.526 --> 00:45:15.647]  That's more decapitations at Facebook.
[00:45:15.987 --> 00:45:19.408]  That's more censorship at Twitter and Reddit.
[00:45:19.948 --> 00:45:23.830]  And that is the eradication of Infowars from the face of the planet.
[00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:26.671]  Look at that.
[00:45:27.426 --> 00:45:31.691]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear and that's because it's been denatured, it's been watered down.
[00:45:31.711 --> 00:45:32.812]  We didn't do that.
[00:45:34.453 --> 00:45:38.578]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something that is the very best I can get?
[00:45:38.978 --> 00:45:40.600]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[00:45:41.207 --> 00:45:49.750]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want that goodwill!
[00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.910]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.091]  Don't you get the big secret?
[00:45:53.731 --> 00:45:56.272]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[00:45:56.292 --> 00:45:57.412]  No, you've never seen that, have you?
[00:45:58.192 --> 00:46:08.475]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[00:46:08.655 --> 00:46:09.035]  Look it up.
[00:46:10.136 --> 00:46:10.616]  Find out.
[00:46:12.702 --> 00:46:16.125]  How even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[00:46:16.165 --> 00:46:21.029]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take the fish oil or krill oil.
[00:46:21.509 --> 00:46:24.612]  Just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.321]  It uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years.
[00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:30.983]  Turmeric is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[00:46:31.363 --> 00:46:36.686]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[00:46:36.706 --> 00:46:45.051]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[00:46:45.392 --> 00:46:50.335]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.
[00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:52.616]  Right now at infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:52.636 --> 00:46:54.157]  Please support this network.
[00:46:59.989 --> 00:47:15.657]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.677 --> 00:47:15.757]  It's 2018.
[00:47:17.578 --> 00:47:20.520]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:27.884]  You're in the future now.
[00:47:31.969 --> 00:47:38.514]  So when I say that I'm about to change course, I mean that we're about to get back on our original course.
[00:47:39.715 --> 00:47:46.841]  Exposing globalism, exposing the world government program, and telling people what's coming in the future.
[00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:55.618]  So that when they see it happen later, they remember and know they were told the truth about what's coming next after that.
[00:47:56.679 --> 00:48:02.325]  Folks will never listen about what's going to come in the near future, or even the distant future.
[00:48:02.965 --> 00:48:09.792]  But when they then learn that they were told the truth 20 years before, 30 years before, they'll start listening.
[00:48:11.169 --> 00:48:15.093]  And then they'll go and hear what you or others are saying at the time.
[00:48:16.094 --> 00:48:18.556]  Because those that control the past control the future.
[00:48:19.236 --> 00:48:22.539]  Those that control the present control the future.
[00:48:23.841 --> 00:48:26.283]  There is a technocracy that's decided you're trash.
[00:48:26.983 --> 00:48:28.185]  That's decided to get rid of you.
[00:48:28.805 --> 00:48:32.629]  That's decided to bring in an anti-human future.
[00:48:33.826 --> 00:48:41.349]  And Trump and other nationalists are just trying to go back to the renaissance that was really the future of a pro-human system.
[00:48:42.189 --> 00:48:48.131]  The globalists are going to use technology and suppressive systems to go back to feudalism with a high-tech overlay.
[00:48:49.252 --> 00:48:53.653]  I am simply stating that getting nationalists in and fighting the globalists is important.
[00:48:54.874 --> 00:49:00.556]  But we can't put all of our energy in constantly fighting those politicized battles.
[00:49:02.093 --> 00:49:10.217]  We have to move past that at many levels and speak directly to people regardless of what party they're in or what group they're in.
[00:49:11.677 --> 00:49:16.700]  The problem is they'd already so balkanized people that Trump had to teach us we were nationalists and that we could have an identity.
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:19.581]  Or we'd be bullied into the globalist identity.
[00:49:19.941 --> 00:49:21.762]  So it's good to have those different identities.
[00:49:23.383 --> 00:49:30.246]  But the nationalist identity is important but it's not really the compendium of the free human identity.
[00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:36.237]  And the big master plan of the globalist versus the free will universe.
[00:49:38.278 --> 00:49:40.018]  So I'm going to get into the world government.
[00:49:40.078 --> 00:49:53.181]  I'm going to get into the future technologies, the current suppressed technologies, the system they're going to set up and develop if they're successful, where we're going, the destination that we are tracking on.
[00:49:54.702 --> 00:49:55.402]  Because I have
[00:49:57.262 --> 00:50:02.645]  Gotten away from Infowars roots doing an hour with doctors and scientists on just about fluoride.
[00:50:02.986 --> 00:50:04.247]  Or an hour on vaccines.
[00:50:04.767 --> 00:50:05.988]  Or an hour on GMO.
[00:50:06.628 --> 00:50:09.390]  Or an hour on Rockefeller Foundation documents.
[00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:10.851]  Or an hour on eco-science.
[00:50:11.691 --> 00:50:14.533]  Or an hour on transhumanists, the plan to end the family.
[00:50:15.294 --> 00:50:19.616]  You're like, well okay, now all that stuff you said 20 years ago and 10 years ago, it's come true.
[00:50:20.057 --> 00:50:21.958]  You've got some credibility, that's why they're censoring you.
[00:50:23.199 --> 00:50:25.120]  Well, let's go to what's coming next.
[00:50:26.365 --> 00:50:49.433]  And where they're going to take us next because I don't go there because the study of it is so horrifying that we're now almost there that even I just want to go eat a big plate of enchiladas and go home and get in the hot tub and go watch Netflix and just forget it.
[00:50:51.084 --> 00:50:51.564]  Do you know what?
[00:50:51.944 --> 00:50:54.886]  That's giving up my free will and turning the universe over to some really bad people.
[00:50:55.206 --> 00:51:00.489]  So we've had our consciousness already hijacked and it's going to get a lot worse, folks.
[00:51:00.589 --> 00:51:14.737]  And so I really want to move back into consciousness and thinking outside the box and transcending the political class.
[00:51:15.938 --> 00:51:17.859]  Now, Trump has tried to do that and Trump is great.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.301]  What I'm getting at here is
[00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:26.032]  The main mission is to warn people about how evil the globalists are.
[00:51:27.293 --> 00:51:31.754]  And if you don't even have Trump in that debate, it's much easier because people have been polarized.
[00:51:32.074 --> 00:51:41.237]  But if you actually go to what David Rockefeller and Macron and others are saying, it's outrageous.
[00:51:41.277 --> 00:51:44.798]  And if you actually go to the history of it, it's even more outrageous.
[00:51:47.199 --> 00:51:49.800]  I said last week, over and over again,
[00:51:50.663 --> 00:52:16.703]  The EU is a private corporate empire set up by the Nazis in 1942, taken over by the Marshall Program in 1945, and now administered, but adopting the whole future Nazi plan of space stations, and the space shuttle, and atomic weapons, and all of that was the Nazi plan.
[00:52:17.364 --> 00:52:18.765]  It was a blueprint for the future.
[00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:31.806]  So when you see Macron come out and say the most unpatriotic thing you can do is to be a nationalist, that's like saying the most horrible thing a mother can do is give birth to her baby and give it milk.
[00:52:33.147 --> 00:52:38.030]  You know the worst thing a mama duck can do is feed her baby duck.
[00:52:39.116 --> 00:52:41.740]  It's literally saying black is white, white is black.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.262]  You say, that doesn't make sense.
[00:52:43.302 --> 00:52:45.204]  They're doing it on purpose everywhere.
[00:52:45.585 --> 00:52:54.356]  When they show, look at this edited video, and it shows our video, and the other video, and ours isn't edited, it's just zoomed in, but they say, can you believe it?
[00:52:54.436 --> 00:52:56.159]  Fire Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[00:53:00.245 --> 00:53:03.326]  It's an act of sabotaging reality.
[00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:08.887]  It's an act of training you that they're the authority, and they're going to hijack reality, and they're going to tell you how it really works.
[00:53:11.248 --> 00:53:11.868]  It's mind-blowing.
[00:53:16.049 --> 00:53:28.652]  So, when I start the next hour, I'm going to play all the clips I've got here of Macron and others, and then I'm going to read from even mainstream news the Nazi EU history.
[00:53:29.665 --> 00:53:40.930]  It's funny, I put that in Endgame, and it had never been in any newspapers until I put it in Endgame, and then people went and looked it up and found it was true.
[00:53:46.153 --> 00:53:48.014]  Of course, you know how we were able to find that, right?
[00:53:49.054 --> 00:53:57.098]  Out of the National Archives, several senators had their private papers stolen by patriots and given to me.
[00:54:00.779 --> 00:54:02.900]  I got some very serious death threats over that one.
[00:54:03.801 --> 00:54:04.261]  And a visit.
[00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:10.025]  But I said, you want to go ahead and indict me for this?
[00:54:10.105 --> 00:54:10.666]  I didn't do it.
[00:54:10.866 --> 00:54:13.868]  A. B. Imagine I'm indicted for what's in these.
[00:54:13.928 --> 00:54:14.788]  It'll draw attention to them.
[00:54:18.611 --> 00:54:20.052]  The whole Nazi plan.
[00:54:23.755 --> 00:54:25.196]  And I'm not saying the globalists are Nazis.
[00:54:25.236 --> 00:54:26.077]  They're even worse.
[00:54:26.377 --> 00:54:29.639]  The Nazis were like an offshoot to try to accelerate the plan.
[00:54:30.199 --> 00:54:32.801]  And, well, hell, we're not going to wait 50 years to implement this.
[00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:33.862]  We'll do this now.
[00:54:36.484 --> 00:54:39.005]  And we're not going to have it where everybody gets exterminated.
[00:54:39.065 --> 00:54:41.767]  We'll just kill everybody but the Aryans.
[00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:46.770]  This is how the world works.
[00:54:46.890 --> 00:54:49.132]  This is the course they set for everybody.
[00:54:49.212 --> 00:54:53.175]  And I'm here saying we might want to set a different course
[00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:55.970]  The Nazi science fiction land.
[00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:13.616]  Then they try to equate Trump with Nazism and with war, because he's a nationalist, even though Hitler wanted to end nation states and have a global empire to, quote, stop war, which is the same thing the Rockefellers wanted, but all it does is start wars.
[00:55:15.117 --> 00:55:17.558]  So here he is saying nationalism is bad.
[00:55:22.765 --> 00:55:33.638]  And then he comes out, and so does his finance minister, and says, we need a total empire, and we need a military to stop people leaving the EU that they never voted to be in.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:36.241]  What's that called?
[00:55:36.401 --> 00:55:39.084]  Never voted to be in it, and there's going to be a military that keeps you in it.
[00:55:39.665 --> 00:55:41.788]  A military dictatorship, the worst type.
[00:55:43.018 --> 00:55:51.040]  So France is announcing a military dictatorship and an empire to stop anyone leaving and to absorb neighboring states.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:56.942]  And then the news says Trump opposes it because he's a fascist and a Nazi.
[00:55:57.762 --> 00:56:09.125]  When Trump is literally opposing a brainchild of the Nazi state and a fascist empire.
[00:56:10.726 --> 00:56:12.166]  A paramilitary fascist empire.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:20.547]  Run by the unelected grandson of the richest royal house in Deutschland.
[00:56:21.688 --> 00:56:22.629]  The Junkers.
[00:56:24.391 --> 00:56:26.554]  You cannot make it up.
[00:56:28.556 --> 00:56:31.219]  Truth is more fantastical than you can ever imagine.
[00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:34.763]  Here's Macron saying, we live in an upside-down world.
[00:56:35.832 --> 00:56:51.067]  This vision of France as a generous nation with a vision which carries universal values has been in those dark times exactly the opposite of the selfishness of a people which only looks at its own interests.
[00:56:52.148 --> 00:56:55.632]  Because patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.
[00:56:56.365 --> 00:56:58.466]  The EU pays no taxes.
[00:56:58.926 --> 00:56:59.586]  The EU is dictatorial.
[00:56:59.606 --> 00:57:04.349]  The EU helped finance the Arab Spring that took over and murdered people en masse.
[00:57:26.601 --> 00:57:28.383]  The EU, you have no rights under the EU.
[00:57:28.403 --> 00:57:31.207]  At least those former nation states have some basic rights.
[00:57:31.247 --> 00:57:35.752]  They're dissolving your country into an empire and calling it loving and liberal.
[00:57:37.194 --> 00:57:38.355]  Unbelievable!
[00:57:39.397 --> 00:57:40.758]  There it is, the EU's architects.
[00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:42.681]  Nazis and Nazi collaborators.
[00:57:48.174 --> 00:57:50.315]  Chase the Patriot from California.
[00:57:50.335 --> 00:57:51.276]  Hello Alex.
[00:57:51.676 --> 00:57:52.857]  Chase, welcome to the airwaves.
[00:57:52.957 --> 00:57:55.699]  This is Chase the Patriot from the front lines of California.
[00:57:55.739 --> 00:57:58.901]  So, I took your reporter challenge on YouTube, Chase the Patriot.
[00:57:58.941 --> 00:58:01.903]  I've been filing reports every single day, but I've noticed a trend.
[00:58:02.003 --> 00:58:04.764]  And there's this false confidence of the Democrats again.
[00:58:04.804 --> 00:58:06.425]  The same thing we saw in the 2016 election.
[00:58:07.646 --> 00:58:10.649]  So it's up to us to counter the narrative and to counter their lies.
[00:58:10.769 --> 00:58:15.973]  And one way I do it is with my YouTube page, but also it's through your t-shirts and your hats, Alex.
[00:58:16.033 --> 00:58:18.255]  I want to promote your t-shirts to everyone out there.
[00:58:18.315 --> 00:58:25.141]  They are great ways to meet people who have like-minds, and they start conversations, and you find patriots.
[00:58:25.241 --> 00:58:27.663]  And it's a great way to spread good messages out there.
[00:58:27.723 --> 00:58:29.124]  So I highly recommend it, Alex.
[00:58:29.284 --> 00:58:29.965]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:58:29.985 --> 00:58:32.228]  When I say these shirts are like shoes you're on adventure.
[00:58:32.688 --> 00:58:36.012]  Wear a mohawn laba, you'll only meet fellow patriots and gun owners, which is great.
[00:58:36.132 --> 00:58:41.278]  Wear a, you know, big obnoxious in full war shirt in red or a Trump pinch shirt, you're gonna meet your friends and your enemies.
[00:58:41.318 --> 00:58:45.403]  So it's a really great way to spread the word and exercise free speech in the third dimension.
[00:58:45.503 --> 00:58:47.864]  Hey, and one more suggestion on that.
[00:58:47.944 --> 00:59:03.331]  You know, a lot of us have, we might have, I don't want to give away anything, but some of us might have a concealed carry, and I would like to see a button-up shirt long enough that I can wear untucked so I can still carry on my hip a pistol, and that's something if you put like a little American flag on the armband.
[00:59:03.351 --> 00:59:04.591]  Oh, it's total genius.
[00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:08.733]  The Info Wars, the Info Wars concealed carry shirt for men and women.
[00:59:08.793 --> 00:59:12.815]  Kind of like a cargo shirt, or like a bowling shirt, or like a...
[00:59:14.095 --> 00:59:19.777]  A utility shirt, and it's got an American flag, it's black, and it's got that, you know, it's not tapered, it kind of flanks out.
[00:59:20.118 --> 00:59:20.638]  That's perfect.
[00:59:20.658 --> 00:59:24.599]  Yeah, and, you know, something you can wear to the office and nobody really knows what's going on.
[00:59:24.699 --> 00:59:27.020]  It just looks like a normal shirt they got from the mall.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:30.382]  But if you can support the cause, you know, if somebody asks, hey, where'd you get that shirt?
[00:59:30.402 --> 00:59:32.523]  It'll say InfoWars.com on the inside.
[00:59:32.703 --> 00:59:33.383]  Absolutely.
[00:59:33.503 --> 00:59:34.223]  We need to branch out.
[00:59:34.243 --> 00:59:36.624]  We've got so many great t-shirts, so many for men and women.
[00:59:36.944 --> 00:59:37.445]  Ball caps.
[00:59:37.485 --> 00:59:38.285]  I don't even promote them anymore.
[00:59:38.305 --> 00:59:41.426]  We've got the best shirts we've ever had, and that's something I never even talk about.
[00:59:41.706 --> 00:59:42.687]  So thanks for calling, Chase.
[00:59:42.707 --> 00:59:43.187]  God bless you.
[00:59:49.466 --> 01:00:04.458]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:07.741 --> 01:00:13.885]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.905 --> 01:00:15.727]  I want to be clear.
[01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:19.991]  I can take this broadcast in any direction I want.
[01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:23.752]  And I'm constantly mad at myself.
[01:00:24.613 --> 01:00:26.313]  So I'm trying to ask the listeners what they think.
[01:00:27.514 --> 01:00:47.342]  Maybe open the phones about what we could do better, because we've got the globalist attention, we're over the target, we know what we're doing, but how do you even sit here when a private world government that's anti-humans being set up, and that's so evil in its own admission, and then the public is so decadent
[01:00:48.655 --> 01:00:54.337]  And so dumbed down they believe mainstream media, at least a large part of them, and don't even care about their own future.
[01:00:55.617 --> 01:00:59.038]  It's a fact that they give you polio through the polio vaccine.
[01:00:59.338 --> 01:01:00.598]  That'd take 10 hours to get into.
[01:01:01.419 --> 01:01:02.319]  But I'm an expert on it.
[01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:04.259]  My grandmother got it from the polio vaccine.
[01:01:04.299 --> 01:01:07.960]  The doctor told her that in the 1950s.
[01:01:09.161 --> 01:01:14.282]  It's a fact that all these people getting polio-like diseases in the U.S.
[01:01:14.982 --> 01:01:16.603]  got it after they took the polio vaccine.
[01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:18.883]  It happens all the world.
[01:01:23.724 --> 01:01:29.265]  It's a fact that measles, mumps, and rubella is popping up when people get vaccinated.
[01:01:30.046 --> 01:01:35.187]  And again, they go, oh, Jones doesn't believe that learned immunity from a vaccination is real.
[01:01:35.467 --> 01:01:37.207]  He doesn't believe in electricity either.
[01:01:37.687 --> 01:01:38.468]  That's a leftist thing.
[01:01:38.488 --> 01:01:40.168]  Like, you don't believe in science.
[01:01:40.728 --> 01:01:44.689]  No, I know about artificially learning immunity.
[01:01:46.072 --> 01:02:04.044]  Under the whole history of vaccination, going back 600 years with smallpox and using a stick to punch into the pustules and then give it to a healthy person, because they found if you got sick when you were healthy, that you lived most of the time, but normally you'd get sick when you were already run down, and so you would die.
[01:02:04.304 --> 01:02:05.625]  I mean, they were pretty smart.
[01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:14.771]  But they'd come and tell you, the apothecary or the doctor would tell the husband and wife, we give this to your kids, about a 5% chance they're going to die.
[01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:22.598]  20-30% chance they're going to die if they don't take this and then later get it themselves.
[01:02:24.319 --> 01:02:27.803]  But it was definitely taking your life in your hands.
[01:02:28.223 --> 01:02:29.984]  They don't tell you that now, folks.
[01:02:30.024 --> 01:02:32.507]  They tell you, safe and effective, never hurt anybody.
[01:02:32.807 --> 01:02:36.370]  And you read the vaccine, it says it'll kill you, deader than a hammer sometimes.
[01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:40.234]  It'll give you Guillain-Barré, narcolepsy, epilepsy.
[01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.672]  And then I read the newspaper every year before school starts.
[01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:48.438]  Every newspaper says, don't believe the conspiracy theorists like Jones.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.442]  You know, the known hoaxer.
[01:02:53.184 --> 01:02:55.246]  And they'll list some straw men things I didn't do.
[01:02:56.127 --> 01:03:00.633]  He says, you know, vaccines can damage you, but worse you'll get's a sore arm.
[01:03:04.221 --> 01:03:08.444]  Unless you're my dad's brother who almost died from a tetanus shot, and they told him it was a tetanus shot.
[01:03:08.464 --> 01:03:13.668]  Or my grandmother who got polio, who just died last year at 90-something years old, who they told her she got it from.
[01:03:13.808 --> 01:03:14.949]  Or all the admissions.
[01:03:15.249 --> 01:03:17.010]  I mean, it's frustrating.
[01:03:18.911 --> 01:03:24.575]  And so, we have a responsibility to go out and warn people because now, all over the world, they're passing laws where you gotta take vaccines.
[01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:26.637]  And they're passing laws
[01:03:29.522 --> 01:03:36.245]  In places like Mexico, they have regulations that if you work for the Justice Department, you've got to take a microchip.
[01:03:36.645 --> 01:03:39.406]  That happened 15 years ago.
[01:03:40.947 --> 01:03:49.131]  You know, as best guess estimate I know of right now, there's probably about 10 million people that got microchips.
[01:03:52.648 --> 01:04:17.089]  I was told by family, who was in Army, classified areas obviously, I was told at an officer's conference, of over a thousand officers, this was 12 years ago, that higher-ups have already gotten the chip, you're going to be getting the chip, don't tell anybody about it, but I was told about it, and they even figured it out, and he got in trouble.
[01:04:20.862 --> 01:04:23.003]  They got passed over for promotion.
[01:04:23.023 --> 01:04:23.924]  I was told why.
[01:04:24.344 --> 01:04:25.705]  Keep your mouth shut about the microchips.
[01:04:27.226 --> 01:04:29.668]  So, let me tell you.
[01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:37.093]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:04:38.694 --> 01:04:41.116]  We're going to talk about that as well when we come back.
[01:04:42.116 --> 01:04:44.157]  And what it really means, never offline.
[01:04:44.277 --> 01:04:45.698]  The Apple Watch is just the start.
[01:04:46.058 --> 01:04:49.279]  How wearable tech will change your life.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:50.940]  Like it or not.
[01:04:51.701 --> 01:04:51.941]  See?
[01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.381]  Like it or not.
[01:04:53.401 --> 01:04:54.502]  You will be assimilated.
[01:04:58.385 --> 01:04:59.545]  We've changed the world with your help.
[01:04:59.865 --> 01:05:01.086]  You've changed the world through us.
[01:05:01.106 --> 01:05:02.126]  We've changed it through you.
[01:05:03.186 --> 01:05:03.847]  I'm in your hands.
[01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:05.107]  Infowars is in your hands.
[01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.007]  The world's in your hands.
[01:05:06.347 --> 01:05:08.528]  I've got really great products that everybody needs anyways.
[01:05:08.588 --> 01:05:09.748]  But we need your funding.
[01:05:09.848 --> 01:05:13.529]  We need money to do this and to continue to fight and hopefully expand.
[01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:15.250]  Because if you don't expand, you can try.
[01:05:15.490 --> 01:05:16.410]  There is no middle ground.
[01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:18.551]  I need everybody today to realize how real all this is.
[01:05:18.991 --> 01:05:21.952]  I told you about the anti-fidoxy and going to the houses is the prelude.
[01:05:22.132 --> 01:05:23.973]  I even said they'll probably do it first with Tucker Carlson.
[01:05:24.013 --> 01:05:25.174]  I don't know how I know all this stuff.
[01:05:25.194 --> 01:05:27.255]  The point is, is that I need everybody to go.
[01:05:27.415 --> 01:05:28.915]  I really need a water filtration system.
[01:05:29.035 --> 01:05:31.316]  And Alex Jones sells the highest rated ones out there.
[01:05:31.496 --> 01:05:33.477]  And they're 49% off right now.
[01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:35.938]  I'm gonna get Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system.
[01:05:35.958 --> 01:05:36.859]  Or I'm gonna get X2.
[01:05:37.079 --> 01:05:38.639]  Uh, which is selling out.
[01:05:38.679 --> 01:05:39.320]  We have the new X3.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.320]  People go, wait, X3 looks a little bit weaker.
[01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:42.741]  Well, yeah, cause it's got three types of iodine.
[01:05:42.841 --> 01:05:44.802]  So there's less of one and then more of the other two.
[01:05:45.062 --> 01:05:46.322]  It's cheaper to put one type in there.
[01:05:46.382 --> 01:05:47.982]  It's better to put all three in.
[01:05:48.322 --> 01:05:50.203]  Tri-iodine.
[01:05:50.343 --> 01:05:50.483]  So X3.
[01:05:50.503 --> 01:05:50.983]  50% off as well.
[01:05:51.003 --> 01:05:51.903]  Free shipping store-wide.
[01:05:51.983 --> 01:05:52.904]  Infowarshore.com.
[01:05:52.924 --> 01:05:54.184]  Without you, we won't be here.
[01:05:54.224 --> 01:05:54.844]  So please support us.
[01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:55.204]  Thank you.
[01:05:57.845 --> 01:06:00.646]  The front lines of the information war.
[01:06:00.986 --> 01:06:02.486]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:02.826 --> 01:06:03.426]  Watch me!
[01:06:04.687 --> 01:06:05.307]  Watch me!
[01:06:06.687 --> 01:06:07.187]  I got it!
[01:06:08.508 --> 01:06:09.028]  Watch me!
[01:06:19.884 --> 01:06:32.895]  Well, we're now kicking off hour number two of the most demonized, most lied about, most dreaded broadcast in the world by globalists, by crony capitalists, by pedophiles, by devil worshippers, and by all their forms of scum.
[01:06:35.437 --> 01:06:37.219]  They are moving mountains to shut us down.
[01:06:39.315 --> 01:06:41.496]  And now they're moving to shut a lot of other folks down.
[01:06:41.896 --> 01:06:57.481]  You know, I haven't gotten into a really key point about the new interim Attorney General, Mr. Whitaker, but if the crew will remind me, I will get into some of that.
[01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:12.829]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, and then we're joined by Jim Hoft, the Gateway Pundit with a lot of incredible breakdowns of what's happening with the ongoing public theft of the governorship, the Senate seat, and other close races.
[01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:20.733]  As more trucks arrived illegally, publicly illegal, and just offload them.
[01:07:21.174 --> 01:07:24.336]  And George Soros' think tank group is running it.
[01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:25.136]  That's in the news.
[01:07:25.736 --> 01:07:31.700]  So it's just the pure, raw, criminal exercise of power by a woman that's done it over and over again.
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:34.301]  And that's just the way it is.
[01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.844]  The governor ordered the ballots impounded last week.
[01:07:38.864 --> 01:07:40.565]  State police said we're not moving a finger.
[01:07:44.807 --> 01:07:47.688]  Because you see, that's how these tyrannies work.
[01:07:49.509 --> 01:07:53.371]  All these people are told, you just roll over, you just go along and you'll be left alone with the trough as well.
[01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:55.371]  Just don't make waves.
[01:07:55.952 --> 01:07:57.432]  We'll all become Venezuela together.
[01:07:59.933 --> 01:08:00.613]  So that's coming up.
[01:08:00.814 --> 01:08:03.655]  But since I mentioned this, let me get to this now.
[01:08:11.098 --> 01:08:13.579]  There are major corporate consortiums
[01:08:14.693 --> 01:08:36.797]  That have spent what I know of billions of dollars conditioning the public since the mid-1990s that in the future everyone will take implantable microchips in their hand or in their scalp of their head.
[01:08:39.807 --> 01:08:42.670]  They've also spent billions promoting cash is dirty, get rid of it.
[01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:57.204]  Because once you've got some money in a cashless society, once everybody trusts it, you can start controlling people, you can start giving people perks if they submit to certain political or cultural operations, like being sterilized, or worshipping a certain god, or doing a certain thing.
[01:08:57.785 --> 01:08:58.466]  It's social control.
[01:08:58.706 --> 01:08:59.647]  The global social score.
[01:09:01.509 --> 01:09:03.150]  And then they use these front companies
[01:09:04.215 --> 01:09:22.283]  To come out and promote how great it is all over the news because the big tech companies and the big banks that are running them don't want to get in trouble with Christians and just smart people that obviously understand that if you have an implantable microchip, you're like a trackable dog under their control.
[01:09:22.363 --> 01:09:24.884]  That's just the beginning of the whole transhumanist movement.
[01:09:24.964 --> 01:09:32.208]  But now, in the last year, like artillery before there's an infantry invasion,
[01:09:33.467 --> 01:09:41.429]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of articles, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, London Guardian, Der Spiegel, even Russian newspapers.
[01:09:42.629 --> 01:09:46.290]  Soon everyone will have chips, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:55.052]  Soon your children will have brain chips and demand they get them, and there'll be laws that by age five they can have the augmentation even if you say no.
[01:09:57.212 --> 01:10:01.273]  So everything we could envision on the track we were on is now here, and suddenly.
[01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:03.470]  The big guns stopped.
[01:10:05.712 --> 01:10:08.554]  They went from you will submit to it's here.
[01:10:13.158 --> 01:10:19.563]  And so now they're in our face telling us that it's that it's here.
[01:10:20.802 --> 01:10:23.463]  And so thousands and thousands of articles are out today.
[01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:27.125]  I looked at dozens of them, and all of them but The Guardian are positive.
[01:10:27.445 --> 01:10:28.525]  Oh, it's so wonderful.
[01:10:29.046 --> 01:10:30.206]  Oh, you're going to accept it.
[01:10:30.566 --> 01:10:31.507]  Oh, it's the coolest thing.
[01:10:32.047 --> 01:10:39.570]  Oh, it's been... Everybody that's doing it has body modification and tats and, you know, the big earrings and everything, which is fine if you want that.
[01:10:40.691 --> 01:10:42.412]  The point is, Washtek
[01:10:43.291 --> 01:10:59.535]  Which was a defunct magazine put up by the Washington Post in the 90s, had several articles with the CIA in it, saying to the tech leaders, we are pushing the body modification movement.
[01:11:01.127 --> 01:11:07.311]  As part of the trans movement, the transhumanist movement, we're going to start with sex changes and body modification.
[01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:13.715]  And once that's accepted, we're going to roll out brain chips, chips in the body, chips in the hand, cashless society.
[01:11:13.755 --> 01:11:25.543]  But our real goal is to get everybody ready for on-demand clones, dogs, cats, your ex-wife, you, human organs grown in cows.
[01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:26.364]  It's all there.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:36.943]  So, see, they come out in establishment publications that are more for the geek mindset, and they tell you everything.
[01:11:37.023 --> 01:11:39.844]  Occasionally, can only one article.
[01:11:40.644 --> 01:11:45.306]  They come out every few years with maybe one or two articles that are test balloons.
[01:11:46.346 --> 01:11:59.291]  I saw one in the Baltimore Sun 20 years ago, and it said, DARPA and the CIA are testing through the cell towers in areas of Maryland, a calming frequency found to make people happier and not commit crime.
[01:12:03.342 --> 01:12:08.705]  I covered that article probably 20 times, had the printout, they later removed it, couldn't find it on the Wayback Machine.
[01:12:09.906 --> 01:12:21.672]  Now I already know about the patents and the whole deal, but one article talking to DARPA about, we've put up mind control towers, just to see how you'd behave when you read that.
[01:12:22.113 --> 01:12:24.274]  So a little test balloon, a little market test.
[01:12:25.779 --> 01:12:27.620]  So that's how we know where this is all going.
[01:12:28.061 --> 01:12:42.090]  And so now, oh, a big consortium of banks and British government companies, companies that carry out British government tasks, contracts, said, if you work for us, you're going to get a chip.
[01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:47.574]  And the Guardian said, that scares people about human rights and tracking.
[01:12:47.614 --> 01:12:50.676]  And we know it's inevitable.
[01:12:50.756 --> 01:12:51.636]  It's always inevitable.
[01:12:51.736 --> 01:12:52.337]  It's inevitable.
[01:12:53.663 --> 01:12:56.826]  Like in science fiction, we are the Borg, you will assimilate or be destroyed.
[01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:58.707]  You will be assimilated.
[01:12:59.328 --> 01:12:59.768]  Submit.
[01:12:59.948 --> 01:13:00.308]  Submit.
[01:13:00.348 --> 01:13:01.669]  In fact, let's play that clip.
[01:13:01.689 --> 01:13:02.010]  Here it is.
[01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:04.532]  We are Borg.
[01:13:05.773 --> 01:13:07.874]  You will be assimilated.
[01:13:10.837 --> 01:13:13.639]  I am Locutus of Borg.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:17.062]  Resistance is futile.
[01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:22.206]  Your life as it has been is over.
[01:13:23.814 --> 01:13:28.917]  From this time forward, you will service us.
[01:13:29.998 --> 01:13:35.361]  You will be assimilated.
[01:13:36.302 --> 01:13:38.343]  Resistance is futile.
[01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:40.144]  We are the Borg.
[01:13:40.184 --> 01:13:43.546]  Lower your shields and surrender your ships.
[01:13:43.566 --> 01:13:44.267]  We will act.
[01:13:46.155 --> 01:14:15.130]  If you look at Elon Musk who had his company and things destroyed because he dared speak up as an example everyone he said I go to these big tech conferences and all they talk about while they're micro dosing on mushrooms and LSD is how they're gonna merge the machine and give their bodies up and then it's in the newspapers you have to die before you become immortal as if you can't just transfer a copy yourself that's gonna be a fraud too you see but oh no you have to die to do it they're here folks it's happening
[01:14:17.597 --> 01:14:26.764]  And Silicon Valley believes they're getting interdimensional instructions while they're on DMT from space aliens to build all this.
[01:14:27.204 --> 01:14:28.425]  I'm not the one saying that.
[01:14:30.486 --> 01:14:31.847]  I'm not the one saying that.
[01:14:32.328 --> 01:14:33.148]  This is not me.
[01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:35.130]  This is who runs things.
[01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:39.253]  They won't give iPads and iPhones to their kids in Silicon Valley, but they want you to.
[01:14:44.977 --> 01:14:46.378]  We're going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:51.198 --> 01:14:52.901]  What are champions made of?
[01:14:54.604 --> 01:14:55.746]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:15:02.327 --> 01:15:03.828]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:15:03.848 --> 01:15:05.750]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.691]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:08.412]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Wait!
[01:15:08.432 --> 01:15:09.493]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[01:15:09.533 --> 01:15:10.834]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[01:15:28.528 --> 01:15:31.670]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:34.411]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[01:15:34.432 --> 01:15:36.373]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 Use the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[01:15:36.393 --> 01:15:37.533]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 That's InfoWarsStore.com
[01:15:56.238 --> 01:16:04.302]  One of the most amazing products that I've seen in years is Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse, available at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:16:04.722 --> 01:16:09.644]  Now, I've got some bags under my eyes, especially right now with really bad allergies in Austin, Texas.
[01:16:10.064 --> 01:16:13.245]  Mold's been at like 1,400 or something, as high as it ever gets.
[01:16:13.525 --> 01:16:14.406]  That makes me get puffy.
[01:16:15.646 --> 01:16:28.073]  But if I use just one little container of Ageless, and I can share it with both eyes, within three minutes you'll see dramatic results, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:28.093 --> 01:16:32.195]  Because I've got some bad bags with allergies, plus I work 15, 16 hours a day.
[01:16:32.535 --> 01:16:35.377]  Everybody knows fighting the globalists is a stressful job.
[01:16:35.777 --> 01:16:36.938]  So, again, just twist it off.
[01:16:38.929 --> 01:16:42.011]  Even a dummy like me can put it under.
[01:16:42.811 --> 01:16:48.834]  I'm not a big metrosexual guy, you know, that worries about my wrinkles, worries about things like that.
[01:16:48.874 --> 01:16:56.418]  But when it comes to having bags under your eyes and being on television or just, you know, anybody in regular life, there's something good to do.
[01:16:57.018 --> 01:16:59.600]  And again, a lot of folks use one per eye.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.542]  I have found that the times I've used it,
[01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:08.719]  I don't even need to use an entire container.
[01:17:09.239 --> 01:17:09.719]  So there you go.
[01:17:09.819 --> 01:17:11.780]  I'm not a cosmetic person.
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:14.881]  I'm not an expert on skin, any of that stuff.
[01:17:15.281 --> 01:17:17.182]  All I know is, over the years, I've tried some other products.
[01:17:17.202 --> 01:17:18.722]  They haven't done anything.
[01:17:18.842 --> 01:17:20.383]  Angelus has a massive effect.
[01:17:20.883 --> 01:17:25.325]  So you get a great product for yourself, for your wife, for your boyfriend, for your girlfriend.
[01:17:25.645 --> 01:17:26.625]  It's good for men and women.
[01:17:27.325 --> 01:17:31.267]  And you fund the InfoWars at infowarsyes.com.
[01:17:31.307 --> 01:17:34.168]  So let's see what happens in the next, I guess, two and a half minutes now.
[01:17:35.579 --> 01:17:36.400]  I'm a human being.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.301]  I have dignity.
[01:17:37.582 --> 01:17:38.262]  I'm gonna resist.
[01:17:38.322 --> 01:17:40.565]  I'm gonna start recognizing the propaganda.
[01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:42.107]  I'm gonna break free from it.
[01:17:42.187 --> 01:17:43.548]  Humanity's gonna come together.
[01:17:53.999 --> 01:17:54.620]  So there you go.
[01:17:55.481 --> 01:17:57.202]  I just applied that kind of like a monkey would.
[01:17:57.242 --> 01:17:59.905]  Not as good as a woman or somebody that's good at this stuff.
[01:18:00.426 --> 01:18:01.607]  And I can already feel it tightening.
[01:18:01.647 --> 01:18:02.708]  It already feels good.
[01:18:03.048 --> 01:18:03.669]  Feels cool.
[01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:05.831]  It's pretty much dry now.
[01:18:05.911 --> 01:18:07.853]  I'm going to go back and look at the time lapse.
[01:18:08.494 --> 01:18:09.254]  It's pretty dramatic.
[01:18:09.675 --> 01:18:10.676]  At least in the past when I've done it.
[01:18:10.696 --> 01:18:11.517]  We'll see what happens here.
[01:18:12.177 --> 01:18:18.441]  It is instantly ageless, along with some other amazing products as well for the skin, supplements, energy.
[01:18:18.522 --> 01:18:21.724]  It's all amazing, cutting edge at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:18:22.264 --> 01:18:24.666]  When you get the Jeunesse products there, you get big discounts.
[01:18:24.686 --> 01:18:26.167]  There's a lot of different specials.
[01:18:26.187 --> 01:18:34.893]  You can also sign up to be a distributor, and that helps fund the war against the globalists and help us continue to try to make America and the planet successful, capitalist, and free again.
[01:18:35.553 --> 01:18:36.393]  Wars are expensive.
[01:18:36.453 --> 01:18:37.154]  We're fighting one.
[01:18:37.474 --> 01:18:37.974]  We're winning.
[01:18:38.034 --> 01:18:38.995]  Thanks for your support.
[01:18:39.295 --> 01:18:41.516]  We try to bring you great products to make it easy to support us.
[01:18:41.816 --> 01:18:43.036]  And this one is a big winner.
[01:18:43.476 --> 01:18:47.098]  Instantly Ageless from Jeunesse at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:18:47.358 --> 01:18:49.199]  And also find banners at InfoWars.com.

[01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:55.611]  Only at InfoWarsYes.com.
[01:18:56.031 --> 01:18:59.694]  Super Silver Wound Gel uses silver salt technology.
[01:18:59.994 --> 01:19:03.417]  There's been extensive research on silver salt technology.
[01:19:03.777 --> 01:19:13.164]  This research includes 20 plus safety reports and test series, as well as the first ever double blind FDA cleared human ingestion toxicity
[01:19:13.804 --> 01:19:14.184]  ...study.
[01:19:14.484 --> 01:19:17.226]  This formula's 24 ppm.
[01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:22.548]  That's 32 ppm version is FDA cleared as a prescription medical device.
[01:19:22.608 --> 01:19:24.969]  Similar products sell for $40 or more.
[01:19:25.229 --> 01:19:29.891]  It's one of the only OTC products that direct claims against MRSA.
[01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:30.491]  Ah, you don't want that.
[01:19:30.911 --> 01:19:34.693]  And VRE, two of the most deadly forms of bacteria that can cause infection.
[01:19:34.913 --> 01:19:37.594]  Great for first and second degree burns, including sunburn.
[01:19:37.855 --> 01:19:41.156]  The Super Silver Wound Gel is essential armor for your wounds.
[01:19:41.536 --> 01:19:46.839]  The barrier protection can last up to three days on the skin, helping to eliminate the chance of infection.
[01:19:46.919 --> 01:19:50.981]  It's perfect for athletes of all ages in all areas of sports.
[01:19:51.861 --> 01:19:54.523]  Super Silver Wound Gel.
[01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.084]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:11.772 --> 01:20:13.794]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:14.175 --> 01:20:15.516]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.016 --> 01:20:29.816]  Here's the bad news.
[01:20:31.858 --> 01:20:42.483]  A technocracy of global social engineers are competing with each other for control of the planet, but they're in pretty much group alignment on the future of humanity, which is obsolescence.
[01:20:44.244 --> 01:20:46.886]  I made the film Endgame showing the proof of that 11 years ago.
[01:20:46.906 --> 01:20:48.567]  I probably should make another one with an update.
[01:20:51.969 --> 01:21:21.261]  The good news is, if Infowars and other liberty lovers around the world could expose global government, expose the anti-human agenda of the globalists, and speak out against it, even though money-wise and propaganda-wise they have more power than us 100 to 1, we're seeing victory through elections and prosperity come rushing back in to areas where we've had limited victories.
[01:21:22.503 --> 01:21:35.408]  That's why Trump's so frustrated is that he clearly is trying to give you a better deal and trying to not let the globalists do one-sided deals to siphon off our wealth and power, not to help the world, but to build their technocracy.
[01:21:36.852 --> 01:21:39.814]  You know, Macron's saying it's very immoral to care about your nation.
[01:21:40.194 --> 01:21:42.875]  A patriot only lovingly cares about the world.
[01:21:42.895 --> 01:21:46.237]  You mean give all your money, your power, your energy to an unelected empire.
[01:21:46.697 --> 01:21:54.441]  And now his top minister came out and said, yeah, we want an empire, we want an army, and a military, a navy to stop anybody leaving the EU.
[01:21:55.201 --> 01:22:00.424]  Wow, an unelected group with a paramilitary control.
[01:22:00.444 --> 01:22:01.885]  That's called a military dictatorship.
[01:22:03.863 --> 01:22:08.672]  But under this alchemy now, Europe should become an empire, says French finance minister.
[01:22:09.173 --> 01:22:10.235]  That's just really running France.
[01:22:12.018 --> 01:22:15.564]  The same ministers at Davos a few years ago said, we're a technocracy.
[01:22:16.834 --> 01:22:19.094]  We're going to get rid of people's national sovereignty.
[01:22:19.635 --> 01:22:27.496]  And so who's running the PR in Fox News and CNN and ABC News that soon everyone will have a microchip?
[01:22:27.856 --> 01:22:30.036]  Soon you won't be able to buy or sell without them.
[01:22:30.377 --> 01:22:36.878]  Soon there'll be a global social score already tested in China that face scans and thumb scans and controls you.
[01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:40.398]  And if you don't play ball, you don't buy or sell, you die.
[01:22:42.239 --> 01:22:43.099]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[01:22:46.283 --> 01:22:50.606]  Executing Christians and Falun Gong Buddhists because they believe in God.
[01:22:50.626 --> 01:22:54.249]  They don't believe in the Silicon God.
[01:22:55.169 --> 01:22:57.931]  Beware those that worship Silicon Gods.
[01:22:58.251 --> 01:22:58.912]  Elon Musk.
[01:22:59.452 --> 01:23:01.494]  Elon Musk, you will be destroyed.
[01:23:04.476 --> 01:23:04.636]  Yep.
[01:23:05.096 --> 01:23:07.878]  The EU wants a super state just as Hitler did.
[01:23:07.978 --> 01:23:10.400]  That's even the London Telegraph because it's the truth.
[01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:14.911]  Look at these articles.
[01:23:15.951 --> 01:23:18.914]  Plan unveiled to microchip hundreds of thousands of U.K.
[01:23:18.934 --> 01:23:19.354]  companies.
[01:23:21.916 --> 01:23:24.718]  Hundreds of thousands of employees at major companies.
[01:23:25.358 --> 01:23:27.460]  Alarm over talks to implant U.K.
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.641]  employees with microchips.
[01:23:28.741 --> 01:23:29.441]  Getting you ready.
[01:23:30.582 --> 01:23:32.403]  You will be chipped, eventually.
[01:23:33.504 --> 01:23:34.125]  USA Today.
[01:23:36.215 --> 01:23:38.857]  Major UK companies preparing to microchip employees.
[01:23:38.917 --> 01:23:39.478]  The Telegraph.
[01:23:39.998 --> 01:23:43.080]  Plan unveiled to microchip hundreds of thousands of UK employees at major companies.
[01:23:44.001 --> 01:23:47.524]  One company wants to implant microchips into the hands of hundreds of thousands of global workers.
[01:23:49.565 --> 01:23:57.732]  Thousands of people in Sweden are willingly microchipping their hands and it's part of the transhumanist movement that is sweeping the globe and the Swedish government is financing it.
[01:23:59.073 --> 01:24:00.033]  Are you ready for your chip?
[01:24:01.835 --> 01:24:02.976]  But what is Time Magazine?
[01:24:03.988 --> 01:24:04.889]  What does Newsweek say?
[01:24:05.269 --> 01:24:06.950]  Let's put that back up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:24:08.571 --> 01:24:10.313]  They've got their new digital issue out.
[01:24:11.994 --> 01:24:16.597]  And it says, you will take the chip whether you like it or not.
[01:24:18.779 --> 01:24:19.199]  You see that?
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:21.201]  You see that right there?
[01:24:23.923 --> 01:24:25.464]  Whether you like it or not.
[01:24:25.544 --> 01:24:27.305]  Let's blow that up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:24:27.646 --> 01:24:30.988]  Whether, which by the way is not doctoring it, it's showing you.
[01:24:31.409 --> 01:24:31.789]  There it is.
[01:24:32.049 --> 01:24:32.810]  Like it or not.
[01:24:35.458 --> 01:24:38.939]  Don't believe your eyes on TV when Jim Acosta pushes and shoves a woman.
[01:24:39.279 --> 01:24:39.720]  No, no.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:46.302]  Just say Alex Jones, who they've now created like a card in the deck of being a fraud.
[01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.103]  Oh, Alex Jones said the sky was blue.
[01:24:49.163 --> 01:24:51.384]  Alex Jones said families were good.
[01:24:51.464 --> 01:24:52.945]  Alex Jones said the sun was yellow.
[01:24:53.225 --> 01:24:54.925]  Alex Jones said you needed air to live.
[01:24:54.985 --> 01:24:55.445]  No, no, no.
[01:24:56.146 --> 01:25:04.489]  You just upload yourself into this machine and it's an AI that's been watching you for 20 years so it can copy your voice, everything you do, but it's not really you.
[01:25:06.186 --> 01:25:18.536]  But you'll pay to be uploaded into it, and your family will believe it's you, and will follow decisions you make as if you're living on, but really it's the AI that's stolen your identity to a level never before seen.
[01:25:20.117 --> 01:25:22.078]  And how are they going to get you to take the microchips?
[01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:28.844]  Well, you want to work in high security areas, you want to work in special ops, you want to work in this bank, you want to do this or that.
[01:25:29.064 --> 01:25:31.586]  We're going to give you a bonus if you do it, to prime the pump.
[01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:36.071]  To access your cell phone.
[01:25:37.352 --> 01:25:38.492]  Oh, now you've got a thumbprint.
[01:25:38.573 --> 01:25:39.813]  Now there's no more codes allowed.
[01:25:39.893 --> 01:25:43.175]  Now you've got to, with the thumbprint, you've got to have a face scan.
[01:25:43.276 --> 01:25:44.336]  No, that doesn't work.
[01:25:44.396 --> 01:25:45.377]  Now you've got to have a chip.
[01:25:46.197 --> 01:25:52.061]  And you'll be so habituated to your phone, so habituated that, sorry, the new TVs that came out don't work without it.
[01:25:52.902 --> 01:25:54.763]  But finally, you go down and you get it.
[01:25:56.024 --> 01:26:15.952]  And now everybody's on it, you're part of the Internet of Things, you're tied into the beast system with your digital mark, meaning you can operate in the system, the globalist trademark, with your own biofrequency identifier that is turned into a code that is implanted and engraved in the chip.
[01:26:19.393 --> 01:26:21.054]  Prophecy fulfilled.
[01:26:22.114 --> 01:26:23.355]  Riddle me that, Batman.
[01:26:24.978 --> 01:26:32.262]  Never offline, never free, never not being surveilled, never not being radiated, never not being tracked.
[01:26:32.902 --> 01:26:40.727]  But to have the chip, to have access to the false world they're building, the Internet of Things, you must submit.
[01:26:40.967 --> 01:26:42.928]  And at first it'll be easy to submit.
[01:26:43.228 --> 01:26:49.832]  Big discounts on phones and electronics and you'll be able to get into secure areas and you'll be cool and laugh at the folks that
[01:26:50.757 --> 01:26:51.658]  Or old-fashioned!
[01:26:52.438 --> 01:27:07.329]  I remember Time Live for Kids, about 15, 16 years ago, had an article, it was written like satire, for 7th graders, and it said, you belong to the future and are smart and savvy and cool and like tech, not like your parents and grandparents that are backward and stupid.
[01:27:08.610 --> 01:27:13.773]  And people didn't believe it on air when I read the actual magazine that a parent sent me, and people went and looked online and said, no, it's true!
[01:27:15.154 --> 01:27:20.158]  Time Magazine for Kids, Time Warner, told your kids your parents are stupid.
[01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:23.059]  But you'll get a chip someday.
[01:27:23.699 --> 01:27:24.800]  And that's in your kid's mind.
[01:27:26.061 --> 01:27:27.983]  You're 7th grader.
[01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:30.225]  15 years ago.
[01:27:31.566 --> 01:27:35.189]  Now, what are they?
[01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.189]  28?
[01:27:35.489 --> 01:27:42.295]  27?
[01:27:36.430 --> 01:27:42.295]  They're 27 years old and don't know why it seems kind of cool when they think about a chip.
[01:27:42.315 --> 01:27:45.858]  Of course, if I was reading, your parents are dumb and belong to a bygone age.
[01:27:45.878 --> 01:27:46.718]  You're going to get the chip.
[01:27:46.898 --> 01:27:48.500]  I'd be like, my God, this is authoritarian.
[01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:53.352]  But see, not the Generation Z and the Millennials, not all of them.
[01:27:53.392 --> 01:27:58.276]  They've been programmed, and it's like all part of the group, and it's the latest thing, and they're gonna get it!
[01:27:58.976 --> 01:27:59.777]  Like it or not!
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:04.260]  And then you read who's behind it.
[01:28:04.601 --> 01:28:06.062]  Oh, the big banks!
[01:28:07.563 --> 01:28:15.349]  Just like prophecy again, the big merchants of the earth, the bankers, the money changers of the earth, that Christ beat with a whip.
[01:28:16.704 --> 01:28:21.426]  They're behind it and who's behind getting rid of the nation state and taking all your rights?
[01:28:21.466 --> 01:28:22.506]  Under the EU you have no rights.
[01:28:22.746 --> 01:28:24.047]  Under the UN you have no rights.
[01:28:24.467 --> 01:28:26.007]  Under any of these systems you have no rights.
[01:28:26.047 --> 01:28:30.889]  Under Article 30 and 29 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[01:28:32.352 --> 01:28:39.876]  It's either telling you, oh, be liberal, be loving like the apple heads who don't pay any taxes and run slave factories, but they're gay, so it's okay.
[01:28:39.896 --> 01:28:41.397]  They're not having kids.
[01:28:41.977 --> 01:28:46.319]  They've taken the first step into a wider world, the post-human world.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:49.461]  We'll be back with Jim Hoff straight ahead.
[01:28:55.819 --> 01:29:01.582]  For months and months and months, CNN, BuzzFeed and others lobbied to have Alex Jones removed from social media.
[01:29:01.862 --> 01:29:05.884]  He was removed from basically all the major social media platforms apart from Twitter.
[01:29:06.324 --> 01:29:08.545]  And then they said, oh, you're not being banned.
[01:29:08.565 --> 01:29:10.686]  You still have a platform on Twitter.
[01:29:11.046 --> 01:29:13.047]  You still have an app in the App Store.
[01:29:13.567 --> 01:29:13.808]  Boom!
[01:29:14.088 --> 01:29:16.349]  Banned by Twitter, banned by the App Store.
[01:29:16.689 --> 01:29:18.270]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:20.130]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:21.311]  You still have a shopfront.
[01:29:21.511 --> 01:29:22.311]  And then what do we see?
[01:29:22.572 --> 01:29:23.332]  Washington Post.
[01:29:23.892 --> 01:29:27.013]  Oh my god, traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars store has increased by 50%!
[01:29:28.373 --> 01:29:31.494]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:29:31.514 --> 01:29:34.355]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:29:34.655 --> 01:29:40.056]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:40.376 --> 01:29:47.378]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros, like Media Matters is, to fund these de-platforming campaigns.
[01:29:47.698 --> 01:29:51.119]  We're not funded by Dolph State dictatorships, like CNN is.
[01:29:51.359 --> 01:29:52.399]  We're only funded by you.
[01:29:57.203 --> 01:30:02.307]  I can't believe there's so many traitors and pieces of crap in this country that actively
[01:30:03.894 --> 01:30:06.415]  Have an inferiority complex with the Republic.
[01:30:06.736 --> 01:30:08.216]  And a spiritual hatred of it.
[01:30:08.516 --> 01:30:09.277]  And it's spiritual.
[01:30:10.177 --> 01:30:14.039]  Because they will go out of their way to destroy this country and their own future.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:22.644]  Because they have some existential envy that they have to act out working with the worst, most murderous, radical Islam.
[01:30:22.904 --> 01:30:29.328]  Orthodox Islam, the Chai Khans, Junker, and it's like Junker's the heir to the top Nazis and has all the stolen wealth.
[01:30:29.448 --> 01:30:39.755]  And Soros is, and it's like it's so crazy that everyone we're fighting are like super villains and their whole histories are pure evil and then the good guys are under attack.
[01:30:39.875 --> 01:30:40.755]  Let me explain something.
[01:30:40.956 --> 01:30:43.897]  I don't feel sorry for myself being lied about and demonized.
[01:30:44.037 --> 01:30:44.818]  I know I'm in a war.
[01:30:44.978 --> 01:30:48.741]  And I feel good to see America waking up and coming back from the dead to a certain extent.
[01:30:48.801 --> 01:30:52.164]  But you know, people should be way more active and way more aggressive.
[01:30:52.344 --> 01:30:54.025]  Because this is serious, folks.
[01:30:54.306 --> 01:30:58.609]  I mean, we're fighting people as bad as Hitler and Stalin and Mao combined.
[01:30:58.769 --> 01:31:00.411]  I mean, they are really wicked.
[01:31:00.551 --> 01:31:02.733]  And they are doing horrible things to our genetics.
[01:31:02.773 --> 01:31:04.154]  They're doing horrible things to our environment.
[01:31:04.354 --> 01:31:09.038]  The things the globalists are up to are so out of control and so bad it makes the head spin.
[01:31:09.178 --> 01:31:11.760]  And it just makes me sad to see America in this position.
[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:12.780]  Again, it's mixed feelings.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:13.721]  Good things are happening.
[01:31:13.761 --> 01:31:14.841]  We're coming back from the dead.
[01:31:14.901 --> 01:31:23.144]  But still, it's so cut and dry that people fighting against this country, people fighting against the reassurgence of our republic, are not Americans.
[01:31:23.424 --> 01:31:24.325]  They're globalists.
[01:31:24.465 --> 01:31:25.925]  They want to overthrow the country.
[01:31:26.025 --> 01:31:28.566]  They're allied with the most murderous regimes in history.
[01:31:28.767 --> 01:31:32.168]  And they know they're involved in a conquering operation.
[01:31:32.648 --> 01:31:33.669]  Cut and it's dry!
[01:31:33.809 --> 01:31:35.410]  I mean, where are your instincts?
[01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:36.711]  Where is your common sense?
[01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:39.653]  We have to stop going along with the globalists and their minions.
[01:31:39.693 --> 01:31:43.896]  And we have to stop trying to placate them and be friends with them and sit here and play nice.
[01:31:43.976 --> 01:31:45.236]  They're not playing nice.
[01:31:45.817 --> 01:31:48.258]  They're a bunch of bullying, evil jerks.
[01:31:48.619 --> 01:31:54.503]  And they now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[01:31:54.663 --> 01:31:56.744]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[01:31:56.884 --> 01:31:58.325]  Because to them, we are death.
[01:31:58.645 --> 01:32:02.448]  To George Soros and to Hillary Clinton and to Barack Obama and to Lord Rothschild,
[01:32:02.768 --> 01:32:05.310]  You understand, I'm the grim reaper.
[01:32:06.671 --> 01:32:07.412]  Come to their door.
[01:32:07.952 --> 01:32:09.333]  I'm death, and they know it.
[01:32:09.533 --> 01:32:11.735]  I'm death of their system, and you're death to them.
[01:32:11.815 --> 01:32:14.237]  We really just love life, but see, to them, we're death.
[01:32:14.337 --> 01:32:23.624]  And if we won't stand against these possessed people, then we deserve to be enslaved by them, and God will hold us in judgment for allowing them to endanger the innocent and the children.
[01:32:23.744 --> 01:32:30.770]  So I tell you now, those of you that have stood idly by, your soul, your immortal soul, is on the line.
[01:32:30.930 --> 01:32:40.079]  And if you don't stand for the unborn, and if you don't stand for the innocent, and if you don't stand against these monsters, and you stand before God, God will say, I know you not.
[01:32:40.119 --> 01:32:41.540]  You didn't do anything.
[01:32:42.441 --> 01:32:45.624]  The Holy Spirit touched you to fight these people, and you were of the devil.
[01:32:46.465 --> 01:32:48.547]  So go back from which you came forever.
[01:32:49.568 --> 01:32:51.310]  You are not amongst us.
[01:32:59.398 --> 01:33:03.540]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.663 --> 01:33:16.205]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:18.185 --> 01:33:20.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.907 --> 01:33:26.609]  So, Roger Stone was toasting with me.
[01:33:27.737 --> 01:33:38.185]  On election night, he said, look, notice Broward County is keeping the so-called announcement closed.
[01:33:38.906 --> 01:33:49.094]  He said every time, every election, going back for decades, the same woman, Brenda Snipes, holds things open and then magically finds the ballots in close races to hand the state to Democrats.
[01:33:49.915 --> 01:33:50.916]  And it's a total nest.
[01:33:51.056 --> 01:33:52.277]  Debbie Washerman Schultz,
[01:33:53.724 --> 01:33:56.465]  You know, the sheriff, all of it is just a sickening nest.
[01:33:56.966 --> 01:34:07.051]  And I think gatewaypundit.com and Jim Hoft, its owner and publisher, but also most prolific writer, has been on top of this, the best of anybody out there other than like drugsreport.com.
[01:34:07.571 --> 01:34:15.195]  So I wanted to try to get him on just for 10 minutes to go over the dizzying amounts of new stuff breaking and it's just insane.
[01:34:15.455 --> 01:34:16.255]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[01:34:17.636 --> 01:34:18.656]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[01:34:19.677 --> 01:34:20.417]  Where should we start?
[01:34:20.457 --> 01:34:21.998]  I mean, what on earth is going on there?
[01:34:23.211 --> 01:34:24.592]  Yeah, this is insane, isn't it?
[01:34:24.872 --> 01:34:31.876]  I don't know about you, but I know my readers and the people up here in Missouri, we're outraged at what the hell's going on in Florida.
[01:34:32.056 --> 01:34:41.242]  Can't believe that they're allowing this to happen and I'm wondering where the hell is GOP and where are these lawyers we hear about?
[01:34:41.562 --> 01:34:47.025]  And as Brenda Snipes continues to add new ballots to the count every hour, it seems.
[01:34:49.106 --> 01:34:50.627]  Today we have a couple big stories.
[01:34:50.707 --> 01:34:59.731]  One is on Drudge and that is that there's a video now from one of the precincts in Broward County on election night, I believe.
[01:35:00.892 --> 01:35:03.073]  I'm not exactly sure when it was.
[01:35:03.113 --> 01:35:03.933]  Let me just be clear.
[01:35:04.373 --> 01:35:08.435]  Anyway, you can see these ladies stuffing these ballots
[01:35:09.449 --> 01:35:10.109]  I don't
[01:35:33.163 --> 01:35:40.235]  These other piles of, it's hard to see what they are, but they start moving them in front so they build a wall.
[01:35:40.696 --> 01:35:42.519]  So you can't see what the hell's going on.
[01:35:43.927 --> 01:35:46.048]  It's really unbelievable.
[01:35:46.148 --> 01:35:53.890]  It's like walking in and you find your child with their hand in the cookie jar and almost all the cookies are gone and there's cookies down their face and then they run around the corner and hide.
[01:35:53.930 --> 01:36:05.914]  This is the most guilty behavior and then they're finding all these trucks pulling up after the law says they can't even bring new ballots and the police wave them in and they say we don't care and the governor orders them pounded and they say go to hell.
[01:36:06.294 --> 01:36:07.595]  I mean this is like incredible.
[01:36:08.621 --> 01:36:29.142]  It's stunning and then last night there was a report that we put up where a ballot box that said provisional ballots was left in an Avis rental car and an airport worker in Lauderdale found the ballot box plus some election signs and
[01:36:30.152 --> 01:36:47.968]  So far we know that they called the Broward County elections people and they didn't care about it so they called the Florida law enforcement and they're still holding this box that says on the outside provisional ballots.
[01:36:48.567 --> 01:36:50.129]  This was left in an Avis car.
[01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:52.451]  So there's a lot of questions that come up with that.
[01:36:52.912 --> 01:36:55.514]  Since when do election workers get rented cars?
[01:36:55.734 --> 01:36:57.897]  That's a serious question.
[01:36:58.217 --> 01:36:59.218]  People should be asking.
[01:36:59.538 --> 01:37:04.083]  Why are we paying for election workers to have rented cars?
[01:37:04.724 --> 01:37:04.904]  Why?
[01:37:04.924 --> 01:37:07.046]  And what's in this box?
[01:37:09.232 --> 01:37:11.014]  Why are they not concerned about this?
[01:37:11.635 --> 01:37:23.471]  And again, it kind of matches with what we saw from those truck videos, where people are willy-nilly moving out boxes that look like ballots around, inside and outside of these... And then the very trucks...
[01:37:24.252 --> 01:37:26.593]  A couple days after the polls closed, these trucks are all out there.
[01:37:26.813 --> 01:37:39.355]  People videotape them with trucks pulling up the night, loading them, and then the very same trucks from multiple videos show up the next day and drive in, and then they're all grabbed and taken off to some secret place, violating state law.
[01:37:39.415 --> 01:37:45.877]  This is like watching guys come out of a bank with stockings over their faces, with bags of money, and we just let them drive away.
[01:37:47.165 --> 01:37:47.866]  Absolutely.
[01:37:48.266 --> 01:37:49.707]  Who's going to stop this, Alex?
[01:37:49.787 --> 01:37:51.348]  I mean, it's infuriating.
[01:37:51.728 --> 01:37:57.811]  If they allow this to continue, if people don't go to jail, you know and I know that this is going to continue from now on.
[01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:02.474]  And Republicans were not, you know, they failed again.
[01:38:02.594 --> 01:38:03.695]  They were not ready for this.
[01:38:03.755 --> 01:38:04.795]  They should have seen this coming.
[01:38:04.835 --> 01:38:06.076]  It happens in every election.
[01:38:06.476 --> 01:38:08.478]  And Alex, here in St.
[01:38:08.498 --> 01:38:12.320]  Louis, where I live, the same sorts of things happen in all these big cities.
[01:38:13.205 --> 01:38:17.408]  Why aren't Republicans more responsible and plan ahead?
[01:38:17.468 --> 01:38:18.789]  It's very troublesome.
[01:38:19.069 --> 01:38:20.330]  I see Matt Gaetz there.
[01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:22.851]  He was one hero this weekend who went down.
[01:38:22.891 --> 01:38:32.337]  The representative from Florida went down and was asking questions and actually was turned away when he saw one of these trucks pull up with the ballot boxes in it.
[01:38:33.666 --> 01:38:35.167]  Well, the public's doing a great job.
[01:38:35.307 --> 01:38:37.748]  They're videotaping the very trucks and parking lots.
[01:38:37.968 --> 01:38:40.329]  People suspiciously pulling up, throwing it in the back.
[01:38:40.589 --> 01:38:47.352]  And then people go to the polling place or the central tabulation area and see the very trucks pull up.
[01:38:47.612 --> 01:38:51.334]  So we're getting some good evidence of this entire chain.
[01:38:51.354 --> 01:38:51.874]  But you're right.
[01:38:52.254 --> 01:38:55.235]  The governor ordered this stuff impounded on Friday.
[01:38:55.835 --> 01:38:57.236]  And there's been nothing's happened.
[01:38:57.256 --> 01:38:58.176]  They're not impounded.
[01:38:58.497 --> 01:39:01.278]  The Democrats are just behind closed doors with quote,
[01:39:01.838 --> 01:39:08.500]  A bunch of Hillary Clinton MoveOn.org groups who are now coming in as the volunteers, Jim.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:24.064]  Yeah, and we have another story we're working on right now that we're going to break this afternoon, but it has to do with the jails down there and how they've been going inside and signing these people up and getting some ballots out of these jails.
[01:39:24.084 --> 01:39:29.385]  We already heard that that one killer, Nicholas Cruz, was able to sign up to vote.
[01:39:29.953 --> 01:39:33.296]  After he murdered a dozen kids.
[01:39:34.137 --> 01:39:36.999]  But there's more to this story and we're going to talk about it this afternoon.
[01:39:37.780 --> 01:39:47.829]  Also, I saw it at gatewaypundit.com, assaultonroadreport.com, we covered it too at newswars.com, but election officials admitting and saying, yeah, we let illegals vote.
[01:39:48.129 --> 01:39:51.352]  Not just Project Veritas Video, they're letting the illegals vote.
[01:39:53.093 --> 01:39:54.173]  What you said is key at the start.
[01:39:54.994 --> 01:39:56.075]  They're setting the precedent.
[01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:58.216]  This woman in Broward County has been caught.
[01:39:58.537 --> 01:39:59.477]  She's been found guilty.
[01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:00.558]  Why is she still there?
[01:40:00.898 --> 01:40:03.400]  And of course the stealing's gotten more naked and more brazen.
[01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:04.861]  Because she's not getting in trouble!
[01:40:05.542 --> 01:40:05.822]  Right.
[01:40:06.443 --> 01:40:06.623]  Right.
[01:40:06.643 --> 01:40:07.964]  That woman should be put in jail.
[01:40:08.404 --> 01:40:11.847]  She wasn't turning over the counts like she was supposed to every 45 minutes.
[01:40:12.247 --> 01:40:15.049]  She never let them know how many more ballots she had left to count.
[01:40:15.449 --> 01:40:16.810]  It's just so corrupt.
[01:40:16.930 --> 01:40:18.852]  I can't believe that this woman is not in jail.
[01:40:19.961 --> 01:40:20.541]  Unbelievable.
[01:40:20.561 --> 01:40:21.181]  Yeah, just unbelievable.
[01:40:45.668 --> 01:40:46.749]  It's very sad to see this.
[01:40:46.789 --> 01:40:48.410]  I hope they get this under control.
[01:40:48.730 --> 01:40:50.071]  I hope they can pull out these seats.
[01:40:50.131 --> 01:40:52.953]  I still have my doubts that Republicans will win now.
[01:40:53.133 --> 01:40:59.277]  You can't allow Democrats to have two days to manufacture votes and expect to win your race.
[01:40:59.898 --> 01:41:01.219]  Well, you said it up front.
[01:41:01.699 --> 01:41:08.544]  The Republicans, being incompetent, greenlighting this, letting them censor the internet, letting Big Tech do this, it's signaled weakness.
[01:41:09.224 --> 01:41:11.468]  In the face of the Democrats on the warpath.
[01:41:11.848 --> 01:41:17.758]  And so in the future it won't just be Arizona and California and Florida where everybody gets cheated.
[01:41:17.938 --> 01:41:19.220]  They're going to do it everywhere now.
[01:41:19.301 --> 01:41:19.721]  Why not?
[01:41:20.874 --> 01:41:22.836]  Right, and we saw that in Georgia this weekend.
[01:41:23.196 --> 01:41:32.304]  On Saturday night, the Georgia Democrat Party tweets out, hey we have several precincts and counties that have discovered thousands of new ballots.
[01:41:32.864 --> 01:41:34.966]  This was on Saturday night they tweeted this out.
[01:41:35.506 --> 01:41:40.410]  So these are not decent people, as you know, more than anyone.
[01:41:40.450 --> 01:41:42.352]  These are not good people we're dealing with.
[01:41:42.712 --> 01:41:44.734]  These are criminals and they need to be stopped.
[01:41:46.184 --> 01:41:47.826]  In closing, I just want to get your take on this.
[01:41:47.886 --> 01:41:50.549]  Trump coming out and saying no, they didn't doctor the video, they blew it up.
[01:41:50.849 --> 01:41:55.514]  They're still on the news everywhere saying we doctored the video when anybody can see it's the same video.
[01:41:56.198 --> 01:41:56.438]  Right.
[01:41:56.918 --> 01:41:59.760]  I think this puts a nail in the coffin of the mainstream media.
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.782]  Anybody who watches that can see that nothing was doctored.
[01:42:04.182 --> 01:42:10.265]  The media, it's unbelievable that they would continue with this meme they have.
[01:42:10.645 --> 01:42:16.969]  And good for Paul Joseph Watson and Infowars and you for, you know, doing the zoom in.
[01:42:17.009 --> 01:42:18.289]  Trump was absolutely right.
[01:42:18.329 --> 01:42:19.830]  I love that he defended you guys.
[01:42:20.370 --> 01:42:23.452]  And so the people will know who to trust.
[01:42:23.852 --> 01:42:26.913]  It may take some time, but they're going to know who they can trust and who they can't.
[01:42:27.814 --> 01:42:28.394]  All right, Jim.
[01:42:28.534 --> 01:42:29.274]  GatewayPundit.com.
[01:42:29.315 --> 01:42:29.955]  Thanks for coming on.

[01:42:35.957 --> 01:42:36.498]  Thanks, Alex.

[01:42:39.799 --> 01:42:43.261]  I've got the fire news, a bunch of out-of-control video.

[01:42:45.502 --> 01:42:46.202]  It's all coming up.

[01:45:04.161 --> 01:45:04.682]  Fire away.
[01:45:04.762 --> 01:45:04.862]  Hey!
[01:45:04.882 --> 01:45:04.962]  Hey!
[01:45:05.002 --> 01:45:05.102]  Hey!
[01:45:05.122 --> 01:45:05.242]  Hey!
[01:45:05.283 --> 01:45:05.423]  Hey!
[01:45:21.102 --> 01:45:24.104]  Hey, I just came out as a transsexual gay toad.
[01:45:24.184 --> 01:45:27.966]  I'm not gonna have you slander my people before I run for office as a Democrat.
[01:45:28.066 --> 01:45:34.630]  I know that's right, but really, we should contribute to you guys because I've been given for years and I've seen the production value just skyrocket.
[01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:39.032]  I mean, your graphics team, just the content in general, everything is going great.
[01:45:39.132 --> 01:45:45.576]  And at the same time, there's no better organization that I could give my dollars to to see it at work on a daily basis.
[01:45:45.856 --> 01:45:49.418]  Well, and we appreciate you, Jason, and that's why we try to give you the best products.
[01:45:49.438 --> 01:45:51.979]  You know, we just don't put something out there and say, hey, please buy it.
[01:45:52.059 --> 01:45:56.300]  We do the research and then actually put out the best possible product.
[01:45:56.380 --> 01:45:59.302]  In the five years of my support, I have never bought a bad product.
[01:45:59.342 --> 01:46:06.044]  And I waste a lot of money on, you know, you go to one of these big box stores, you buy a piece of crap, and a psychologist throw away $10.
[01:46:06.365 --> 01:46:09.286]  You throw $10 at that toothpaste, guarantee it won't be a waste.
[01:46:09.366 --> 01:46:11.927]  Especially if you love your kids, why would you give them fluoride?
[01:46:12.247 --> 01:46:13.528]  Yeah, yeah, just go and look.
[01:46:13.908 --> 01:46:15.189]  You know, here's what I would say to the audience.
[01:46:15.309 --> 01:46:23.515]  If you're not using super blue fluoride toothpaste, go home and look at the toothpaste that you're using, and on the back of it, it will say, harmful if swallowed.
[01:46:23.815 --> 01:46:29.258]  Contact poison control for 0.01% of fluoride.
[01:46:30.259 --> 01:46:31.480]  0.01, harmful if swallowed.
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:32.781]  They put that in the water.
[01:46:32.821 --> 01:46:34.162]  Yep, that's if you love the kids, though.
[01:46:34.202 --> 01:46:35.943]  Hey, I'm not telling you how to spend their money.
[01:46:35.963 --> 01:46:36.363]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:46:36.383 --> 01:46:36.603]  Good point.
[01:46:36.643 --> 01:46:38.765]  If you don't love your kids, just keep giving them the fluoride.
[01:46:38.785 --> 01:46:39.285]  Yeah, that's fine.
[01:46:40.886 --> 01:46:46.649]  No matter what the globalists want to do, no matter what politicians want to do, this country is going to make it!
[01:46:49.971 --> 01:46:52.632]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.517 --> 01:47:25.863]  You see, the last few decades, the globalists, the social engineers, were setting up their system, preparing it.
[01:47:28.605 --> 01:47:35.232]  Preparing to bring down the West, preparing to bring down any future competition that could challenge their hegemonic world government rule.
[01:47:36.993 --> 01:47:43.059]  Trying to bring down the idea of the West, the Christian ethos, all of it, that could block this system.
[01:47:45.259 --> 01:47:46.740]  And now, they're out in the open.
[01:47:47.581 --> 01:47:48.622]  World government's here.
[01:47:49.142 --> 01:47:51.785]  The EU is an empire ready for war with the US.
[01:47:52.345 --> 01:47:53.266]  Allied with Islam.
[01:47:55.188 --> 01:47:58.010]  Being a nationalist and caring about your country is evil.
[01:47:58.691 --> 01:47:59.671]  It's all concerted.
[01:48:00.672 --> 01:48:03.655]  And everybody in England needs to get microchips.
[01:48:04.175 --> 01:48:07.018]  And the government's preparing that if you work at a bank, you've got to get one.
[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:12.983]  It's all being announced right now.
[01:48:15.728 --> 01:48:21.451]  From free market, Americana nationalism comes everything we enjoy, everything that everyone wants to get here to have.
[01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:26.733]  With globalism comes absolute tyranny.
[01:48:29.954 --> 01:48:32.976]  But imagine if they can get you to say, oh, my nation shouldn't have any authority.
[01:48:35.177 --> 01:48:40.559]  Where you pay taxes where you live, now they transfer your money out to an international government where you have no rights.
[01:48:42.498 --> 01:48:46.120]  Only special NGOs created by the globalists have a voice.
[01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:48.541]  They're the astroturf.
[01:48:49.542 --> 01:48:50.722]  So we're now at that point.
[01:48:51.823 --> 01:49:00.187]  And when I say I'm going to change course, I've been just pure backing Trump, pure backing the resurgence of nationalism to get these beachheads going.
[01:49:00.207 --> 01:49:01.227]  And that's good, that's important.
[01:49:01.988 --> 01:49:07.491]  But everybody on the street, everybody that works here, my family says, man, you used to make documentaries.
[01:49:08.359 --> 01:49:23.364]  You used to go in-depth on particular topics, and so the Democrats always attacked you, because you were pro-life and pro-gun, but other than that, we were able to get the info out to anybody, because it didn't have that political flavor to it.
[01:49:24.725 --> 01:49:29.526]  But see, we had to come out and say nationalism's okay, to say that we have a right to exist.
[01:49:29.546 --> 01:49:32.487]  Because we have an identity, other than globalism.
[01:49:32.787 --> 01:49:37.109]  Globalism takes all your identities, and then gives you their false identity.
[01:49:38.217 --> 01:49:39.617]  So the nation-state's not perfect either.
[01:49:39.677 --> 01:49:40.418]  It's got its problems.
[01:49:40.438 --> 01:49:42.098]  And there are different flavors around the world.
[01:49:43.499 --> 01:49:52.882]  They try to confuse the public that, to say the country exists, to say I believe in America and our system, that that's somehow evil or racist.
[01:49:54.682 --> 01:50:05.646]  No, it means the big mega-corporations that have set up deals with China, where they have giant tariffs on us and we don't have tariffs on them, it means if we don't bend over,
[01:50:06.857 --> 01:50:10.198]  And let multinational corporations loot the living hell out of us.
[01:50:12.319 --> 01:50:12.779]  We're bad.
[01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:21.502]  And see, first it's don't be a white supremacist, and then don't be this, and then don't be that, and soon it's don't be a mother, don't be a father, don't be a Christian, don't be a nationalist.
[01:50:22.502 --> 01:50:24.543]  And everyone just rolls over in virtue signals.
[01:50:25.764 --> 01:50:29.085]  Mark Dice sent a tweet out saying, look at the cultural appropriation.
[01:50:29.365 --> 01:50:34.006]  They have a white kid in a Black Panther Halloween costume.
[01:50:34.046 --> 01:50:34.547]  Take it down.
[01:50:34.567 --> 01:50:35.707]  And they apologized and did.
[01:50:38.663 --> 01:50:50.206]  Because the corporations want to train you through social engineering, through Pavlovian conditions, through peer pressure, to do outrageous, crazy things in the name of being patted on the head by the system.
[01:50:51.207 --> 01:50:54.428]  But you get nothing out of that but slavery and poverty.
[01:50:56.248 --> 01:51:01.350]  The people still sell out to it, especially folks that go get the worthless college degrees.
[01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:04.611]  There are big estimates out there.
[01:51:04.631 --> 01:51:06.491]  I've been talking about this for 20 plus years.
[01:51:06.511 --> 01:51:08.292]  Limbaugh's been talking about it for 30 plus years.
[01:51:10.472 --> 01:51:15.214]  How college degrees, for 90% of the degrees, are beyond worthless.
[01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:18.275]  You've got to pay for them, and you end up never getting your money back.
[01:51:18.315 --> 01:51:19.556]  So they're beyond worthless.
[01:51:20.536 --> 01:51:21.196]  They're negative.
[01:51:23.057 --> 01:51:27.359]  It's like saying, what's the value of kidney cancer?
[01:51:27.499 --> 01:51:29.140]  Maybe they cut the kidney out, you survive.
[01:51:29.180 --> 01:51:30.460]  But was there a value to having it?
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:30.660]  No.
[01:51:30.881 --> 01:51:34.122]  It has a negative value on your health and monetarily.
[01:51:34.362 --> 01:51:36.623]  Having the kidney removed wasn't a plus.
[01:51:37.203 --> 01:51:39.004]  Show globalisms like cancer.
[01:51:43.086 --> 01:51:44.687]  College is like cancer.
[01:51:44.967 --> 01:52:00.436]  But, you see, they know you're gonna get inducted into this thing, and then it's gonna be worthless, so they go, oh, get a second degree, get a third degree, and by then you just get a politically brainwashed degree, so you can be a politico or an operative, if you're corrupt, that's the only job you're gonna be able to get paid on.
[01:52:02.537 --> 01:52:08.701]  And now your whole identity and the hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt you've got, you're 35 years old, you've got three degrees,
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:16.803]  And only by submitting to the priest class, whatever the new brainwashing is, whatever the new directive is, do you exist.
[01:52:18.404 --> 01:52:21.845]  And now they say it's not enough to get your money as a college professor.
[01:52:22.445 --> 01:52:25.387]  You've got to go out and put on a black uniform and beat people up.
[01:52:25.767 --> 01:52:27.568]  And you've got to go out and harass people online.
[01:52:27.808 --> 01:52:31.670]  And you've got to shut down free speech all over America, just like you did on the university!
[01:52:32.770 --> 01:52:34.491]  Now get out there and get the job done!
[01:52:35.011 --> 01:52:36.012]  Sir, yes sir!
[01:52:37.672 --> 01:52:38.653]  This is an army.
[01:52:41.670 --> 01:52:42.771]  This is a program!
[01:52:43.772 --> 01:52:45.213]  These people are coming for us!
[01:52:45.333 --> 01:52:45.853]  They're here!
[01:52:47.274 --> 01:52:48.275]  And why do we put up with it?
[01:52:49.816 --> 01:52:50.777]  Why do we bend over to it?
[01:52:53.819 --> 01:52:55.480]  The cashless society's here.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:57.922]  It's going to be used to totally oppress everybody.
[01:52:58.182 --> 01:53:00.384]  A lot of folks go, well then I better keep my mouth shut.
[01:53:01.504 --> 01:53:01.964]  Exactly.
[01:53:02.044 --> 01:53:03.965]  They're betting that you're cowards.
[01:53:04.725 --> 01:53:19.371]  And if you make the wrong decision now, oh don't follow Alex Jones on Twitter, not that you can anymore, or you won't be able to get entrance into college even though you have a 3.9, why would you want to go to an institution that's anti-free speech and authoritarian?
[01:53:20.231 --> 01:53:21.432]  You know you're going to get ripped off!
[01:53:22.172 --> 01:53:22.812]  It's worthless!
[01:53:24.853 --> 01:53:28.914]  Go to a university that doesn't act like that and then soon those will be the preeminent universities.
[01:53:29.134 --> 01:53:30.135]  They're teaching something real.
[01:53:30.999 --> 01:53:33.900]  Everything has become a con job on purpose!
[01:53:38.903 --> 01:53:40.723]  The globalists are betting against humanity.
[01:53:40.783 --> 01:53:42.224]  We have to bet on humanity.
[01:53:43.344 --> 01:53:44.665]  It's the only future we have.
[01:53:44.725 --> 01:53:46.246]  It's the only chance we have.
[01:53:48.147 --> 01:53:57.671]  But the universities and the high schools and the TV and the culture is creating nasty, horrible, little narcissistic demons.
[01:53:58.749 --> 01:54:02.632]  That just kind of NPC and bot around and all the studies show.
[01:54:03.032 --> 01:54:04.293]  Way more likely to steal.
[01:54:04.953 --> 01:54:09.096]  Way more likely to tell you you should virtue signal, but not do anything themselves.
[01:54:10.897 --> 01:54:21.384]  We have created a bunch of twisted, weak politicos who have been promised the world, but first they've got to conquer you.
[01:54:22.825 --> 01:54:24.506]  And are you going to let these people do this?
[01:54:25.366 --> 01:54:27.168]  That's why what Trump is doing is so great.
[01:54:28.206 --> 01:54:47.806]  He's trying to unify us, trying to get America a better deal, trying to show people that Americana works a lot better than collectivism and the nightmare of Apple, that literally has the lowest paid employees in the world, and suicide nets, and just helps report on Buddhists and Christians to have them murdered, and so does Google.
[01:54:49.645 --> 01:54:54.686]  And Sundar, the head of Google, comes out and tells Congress, you should want us to censor.
[01:54:54.966 --> 01:54:58.527]  These are very helpful things we can do for you.
[01:54:59.528 --> 01:55:02.969]  They said to Sundar, this is very evil what you're doing, helping impress the Chinese.
[01:55:03.009 --> 01:55:04.409]  He said, no, it's great.
[01:55:05.509 --> 01:55:06.530]  These are great services.
[01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:09.050]  That's how just committed to the evil.
[01:55:09.330 --> 01:55:10.731]  These guys aren't even hiding anymore.
[01:55:10.771 --> 01:55:12.251]  They're just like, no, we're taking over.
[01:55:12.531 --> 01:55:13.632]  And there's nothing you can do now.
[01:55:14.032 --> 01:55:15.332]  Just like the cover of Time Magazine.
[01:55:21.237 --> 01:55:23.398]  Put it back up there, it says, you will be assimilated.
[01:55:23.738 --> 01:55:27.578]  Implantable tech is here and you will accept it.
[01:55:28.339 --> 01:55:31.219]  Yeah, those are articles from a month ago or so.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:36.641]  Now, Sundar just openly says, it's all accelerated, oh no!
[01:55:36.661 --> 01:55:38.281]  It was a letter to the Senate.
[01:55:38.701 --> 01:55:40.602]  He said, no, these are great things.
[01:55:40.662 --> 01:55:41.782]  Censorship is good.
[01:55:42.122 --> 01:55:44.002]  It's good.
[01:55:44.342 --> 01:55:47.503]  At first they weren't doing it, now they're doing it, but it's for your own good.
[01:55:49.284 --> 01:55:50.804]  Another key point here, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:55:52.967 --> 01:55:56.851]  That I need to make is that I tend to always do it at the end of the hour.
[01:55:56.871 --> 01:55:58.493]  I tend to do it like in 30 seconds, a minute.
[01:56:00.335 --> 01:56:04.119]  And it really doesn't do this show, this operation justice, or it doesn't do you justice.
[01:56:04.559 --> 01:56:08.944]  We have the Alexa Pure water filtration system that leading competitors cost $300.
[01:56:09.024 --> 01:56:09.444]  It's normally $200.
[01:56:14.071 --> 01:56:15.372]  And right now, it's $127.
[01:56:16.273 --> 01:56:24.058]  You cannot get a better stainless steel gravity-fed filter that cuts out all the garbage but leaves the good minerals in for anything near this.
[01:56:25.199 --> 01:56:28.681]  The leading competitors are crap, I can tell you, and I'm not going to say anything else.
[01:56:29.161 --> 01:56:30.202]  But that's why we don't carry them.
[01:56:30.823 --> 01:56:32.584]  Alexa Pure is amazing.
[01:56:34.312 --> 01:56:37.916]  Highest ratings, highest customer evaluations.
[01:56:38.176 --> 01:56:40.219]  It's what I use at my home.
[01:56:40.759 --> 01:56:44.243]  I cook with reverse osmosis and then I use this for drinking water and I have bottled water.
[01:56:44.283 --> 01:56:45.785]  The point is, is that I love it.
[01:56:46.186 --> 01:56:47.187]  I use it when I go on the road.
[01:56:47.647 --> 01:56:50.771]  Infowarstore.com, Alexa Pure Pro.
[01:56:50.931 --> 01:56:52.192]  That's their big one, the nice one.
[01:56:52.553 --> 01:56:54.875]  They're all nice, but it's, you know, the big one.
[01:56:55.973 --> 01:56:56.133]  I mean,
[01:57:16.039 --> 01:57:19.061]  And if everyone just committed to go, you know, I'm gonna filter my water.
[01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:20.802]  There's a lot of crap in there for my kids.
[01:57:21.002 --> 01:57:26.226]  If everybody listening just got one, that would fund us, you'd have cleaner water, a 360 win.
[01:57:27.426 --> 01:57:28.607]  You cannot beat the deal.
[01:57:28.627 --> 01:57:30.168]  Normally $249, now $127.
[01:57:30.889 --> 01:57:33.711]  Look at the 91% ratings, 4.7 stars.
[01:57:34.151 --> 01:57:36.833]  Infowarstore.com, get your Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:57:37.753 --> 01:57:40.235]  Filtration for the air as well at Infowarstore.com.
[01:57:45.812 --> 01:57:54.034]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:54.234 --> 01:57:55.475]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:55.695 --> 01:57:59.996]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:00.016 --> 01:58:03.497]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com.
[01:58:03.997 --> 01:58:05.479]  I still have that energy.
[01:58:05.699 --> 01:58:25.940]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:30.182]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:59:48.126 --> 01:59:54.090]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:55.551 --> 02:00:06.897]  Alright, we're back.
[02:00:07.818 --> 02:00:14.342]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:31.904]  Alright, I'm going to give the number out in the next segment, and I'm going to go to your phone calls, and I'm going to obviously get to all the other news as well, but I came across this article from the day I was banned off the internet, off these globalist platforms, and of course The Purge has now been all across the spectrum.
[02:00:33.883 --> 02:00:36.625]  Any leftist groups not controlled by the globalists, they're being shut down now too.
[02:00:37.265 --> 02:00:43.849]  Alex Jones and Donald Trump, you need to blow the whistle on Chinese communist infiltration of Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party.
[02:00:43.889 --> 02:00:45.710]  And he did do that three days later.
[02:00:46.090 --> 02:00:48.911]  Because he's already being told that by the Pentagon and his own research.
[02:00:49.452 --> 02:00:53.114]  But I thought, since this is one of the reasons we got banned, was me hammering this.
[02:00:53.174 --> 02:00:58.137]  This was the last straw that we'd go ahead and play this most banned of the most banned.
[02:00:58.177 --> 02:00:58.477]  Here it is.
[02:00:59.909 --> 02:01:03.890]  You know about it when I'm getting banned or shadow banned because I'll make a big deal about it.
[02:01:05.851 --> 02:01:09.292]  Matt Gaetz was shadow banned and we told him two weeks before.
[02:01:09.692 --> 02:01:11.072]  Roger Stone told him.
[02:01:11.932 --> 02:01:15.914]  On the phone and in text messages, we've run you through their system.
[02:01:16.314 --> 02:01:17.674]  We have sites that look at this.
[02:01:17.714 --> 02:01:18.334]  We send him links.
[02:01:18.654 --> 02:01:19.795]  You're already 90% banned on Twitter.
[02:01:22.307 --> 02:01:26.108]  Gates went up during the committee hearing and said, you're a private company, you can do whatever you want.
[02:01:26.388 --> 02:01:27.189]  Not even getting it.
[02:01:27.449 --> 02:01:29.269]  So the next day, they shadow banned him 99%.
[02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:33.271]  They go, this guy's an idiot.
[02:01:33.511 --> 02:01:36.212]  We all just lied to him and said we don't censor any conservatives.
[02:01:36.432 --> 02:01:37.232]  He said, that's fine.
[02:01:37.832 --> 02:01:39.313]  Just don't talk about killing congressmen.
[02:01:40.882 --> 02:01:42.644]  And then the next day, they banned him down to nothing.
[02:01:42.845 --> 02:01:44.567]  Then he said he felt victimized.
[02:01:44.807 --> 02:01:46.289]  And I'm not trying to put Matt Gage down.
[02:01:46.489 --> 02:01:47.651]  Just come on, man!
[02:01:47.991 --> 02:01:48.752]  Get it together!
[02:01:48.972 --> 02:01:50.114]  Figure out what's going on!
[02:01:50.434 --> 02:01:52.377]  Mainstream corporate media is fake news.
[02:01:52.577 --> 02:01:54.740]  They're the enemy of the American people, like the President said.
[02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:57.964]  And now, they're coming after everybody.
[02:01:58.565 --> 02:01:58.685]  Now.
[02:02:00.165 --> 02:02:03.849]  If you want to get into the real reason all this is happening, I know it's demoralizing.
[02:02:03.869 --> 02:02:06.652]  I don't want to demoralize people, but facts are facts, like having cancer.
[02:02:06.893 --> 02:02:07.554]  It's operable.
[02:02:07.794 --> 02:02:09.035]  We can fix it, Mr. President.
[02:02:10.096 --> 02:02:12.539]  You know the Office of Personal Management was done by insiders.
[02:02:12.559 --> 02:02:14.061]  That's even come out in intelligence reports.
[02:02:14.121 --> 02:02:15.943]  They try to keep it quiet because it's such treason.
[02:02:15.983 --> 02:02:16.584]  It's unbelievable.
[02:02:17.004 --> 02:02:19.667]  We know China owns the majority of our debt after the private Federal Reserve.
[02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:21.830]  We know they now own Hollywood.
[02:02:22.331 --> 02:02:26.216]  You've helped block some of them buying up American Bandstand, a few final things they didn't own.
[02:02:26.836 --> 02:02:35.386]  We know that they're teaching Maoism in the colleges, and all 50 major state-funded colleges have major Chai Com infiltration.
[02:02:35.687 --> 02:02:37.348]  Some of them are run by the Chai Coms.
[02:02:37.509 --> 02:02:39.231]  Even the Washington Post had to admit.
[02:02:41.158 --> 02:02:46.005]  We know that the People's Army of China has been caught running Dianne Feinstein's operation.
[02:02:46.045 --> 02:02:48.669]  We know their penetration is hundreds of times that of the Russians.
[02:02:48.709 --> 02:02:55.839]  We know they're involved in election meddling, and were so arrogant they went to Davos a year and a half ago and said they would stop your agenda, along with Juncker.
[02:02:57.165 --> 02:02:59.388]  Mr. President, America knows you're real.
[02:02:59.928 --> 02:03:05.554]  They know the Democrats are the anti-American globalists outlawed by the shycoms, radical Islam, the unelected EU, and others.
[02:03:06.035 --> 02:03:17.448]  If you come out before the midterms and make the censorship the big issue and them trying to steal the election, and if you make the fact that we need an Internet Bill of Rights and antitrust busting on these companies, if they don't back off right now.
[02:03:19.551 --> 02:03:38.509]  And if you don't come out and point out that the Communist Chinese have penetrated and infiltrated and are way, way worse than the Russians, because it's true, and the Democrats are scared of that coming out, and you've got the Feinstein info coming out, and more is about to come out, just as I've told everybody, then they will be able to steal the midterms and start the impeachment.
[02:03:40.530 --> 02:03:42.292]  It's the right thing to do, Mr. President.
[02:03:42.412 --> 02:03:43.053]  It's the truth.
[02:03:44.736 --> 02:03:46.058]  And it's crazy to believe it.
[02:03:46.138 --> 02:03:47.059]  It's crazy to understand it.
[02:03:47.179 --> 02:03:48.400]  I know you've been told this.
[02:03:49.061 --> 02:03:58.351]  From our technology, to the South China Sea, to everything, to them having 98% of rare earth minerals, they didn't do that by themselves.
[02:03:58.371 --> 02:03:59.072]  They were given that.
[02:03:59.452 --> 02:04:01.714]  David Rockefeller said he was going to move everything to China.
[02:04:02.395 --> 02:04:03.876]  They said they were going to do all this.
[02:04:04.557 --> 02:04:22.594]  And now you've stepped in, the country's coming back from the dead, they're desperate to stop it, and they're trying to stop you and every American from having their speech by defaming me, lying about what I've done, Soros financing fake lawsuits to give it legitimacy, and now deplatforming me ahead of it because the lawsuits are all getting thrown out because they're lies.
[02:04:22.614 --> 02:04:26.037]  90% of what's in these things are total frauds!
[02:04:27.546 --> 02:04:33.070]  And they know we're getting stronger, and they know we're moving forward, and they now have made the wrong move.
[02:04:33.531 --> 02:04:34.872]  I believe they've jumped the shark.
[02:04:35.332 --> 02:04:46.360]  I believe they've won the battle, but they're going to lose the war if you, with your vision, continue to take action and make free speech and this internet antitrust garbage the number one issue and move against them now.
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:49.323]  If you don't, they are going to steal the midterms.
[02:04:49.503 --> 02:04:55.147]  They're already doing it with economic contributions to the Democrats, blocking everybody else's speech that supports America.
[02:04:56.274 --> 02:04:58.335]  You need to support independent media that's under attack.
[02:04:58.375 --> 02:05:01.798]  We're under attack by these globalists, as you know, and your support's been amazing.
[02:05:01.818 --> 02:05:15.086]  We make it easy to support us because we have great products, and we're announcing a mega blowout sale at Infowarsstore.com to fund us into the new year so we have a budget to continue on in the face of their attacks.
[02:05:15.586 --> 02:05:17.608]  Super male and super female vitality.
[02:05:18.348 --> 02:05:23.333]  It's incredibly high quality cold-pressed herbs known for strength, stamina, libido, energy.
[02:05:23.573 --> 02:05:24.074]  It's amazing.
[02:05:24.314 --> 02:05:28.137]  It is a whopping 57% off.
[02:05:28.438 --> 02:05:30.600]  Silver Bullet, Colloidal Silver, super high quality.
[02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:31.641]  The best out there.
[02:05:31.681 --> 02:05:32.662]  Never gone this low.
[02:05:34.083 --> 02:05:36.065]  67% off to blow it all out.
[02:05:36.505 --> 02:05:39.608]  Brainforce Plus, now available, 50% off.
[02:05:39.968 --> 02:05:42.890]  Survival Shield X3, the best iodine out there.
[02:05:43.110 --> 02:05:45.832]  Brand new product, 50% off and free shipping.
[02:05:46.052 --> 02:05:55.360]  And we're continuing free shipping store-wide on Alexa, Pure Breeze, water filters, and on all the other books and videos and materiel at the M4 Store.
[02:06:08.872 --> 02:06:11.034]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:11.474 --> 02:06:13.156]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.919 --> 02:06:27.928]  So, the day that I was banned by so-called Big Tech before they started their major purge against everybody else, a few months ahead of the midterms on August 7th,
[02:06:29.617 --> 02:06:32.759]  I said to the president, if you don't do this, they're going to steal the election.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:38.764]  A month later, he came out and said, look, they're buying four-page ads and full-page ads in major newspapers.
[02:06:39.024 --> 02:06:43.927]  The Chinese government, saying I'm bad, vote against Republicans.
[02:06:45.689 --> 02:06:46.609]  That's open and shut.
[02:06:47.110 --> 02:06:51.152]  He brought it up at the UN, right to the Chinese ambassador to the UN.
[02:06:53.274 --> 02:06:54.475]  It's China that owns Hollywood.
[02:06:54.495 --> 02:06:56.556]  It's China that owns the national debt through fraud.
[02:06:56.616 --> 02:06:58.878]  It's China that has 98% of rare earth minerals.
[02:07:00.026 --> 02:07:10.455]  And America has been maneuvered from being the global power, with 50 plus percent of the wealth, 4% of the population of the planet, in the 1950s, to now having almost nothing.
[02:07:11.796 --> 02:07:13.777]  We've been maneuvered into destruction.
[02:07:14.798 --> 02:07:15.619]  And I warned the President.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:19.922]  And RealClearPolitics memorialized it.
[02:07:23.705 --> 02:07:27.709]  And I used all that attention when Drudge was top-linked to us to not talk about Infowars.
[02:07:29.295 --> 02:07:54.280]  But to talk about our enemies, the globalists, who shut up Communist China and use it as their economic and military engine for global takeover, allied with the unelected EU, now saying it needs to be an imperial army to fight the US and other nations, and that nations are bad, and that we should be EU patriots, Macron said,
[02:07:56.613 --> 02:08:08.822]  When the EU was unelected, dictatorial, doesn't pay taxes, and now these countries that never voted to be part of it, remember it was a trade deal, like the IMF, the World Bank, the TPP, but became incrementally a total dictatorship.
[02:08:09.562 --> 02:08:15.866]  England voted three years ago to get out, and they can't get out!
[02:08:20.069 --> 02:08:20.690]  They can't get out.
[02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:36.936]  And then Bloomberg comes out and says, we need more technocrats in front page articles saying we need dictatorships worldwide by tech companies serviced and controlled by big banks.
[02:08:38.597 --> 02:08:41.798]  And the big tech companies are moving in and they're doing it.
[02:08:43.539 --> 02:08:47.561]  So I've warned the president, and this is my emergency message to the president again,
[02:08:49.298 --> 02:08:50.519]  You must act now.
[02:08:50.759 --> 02:08:51.739]  And I know you gave the orders.
[02:08:51.779 --> 02:08:53.300]  I know you gave the orders to Rod Rosenstein.
[02:08:53.340 --> 02:08:53.880]  He didn't do it.
[02:08:54.681 --> 02:08:56.362]  Now you've got Mr. Whitaker.
[02:08:58.363 --> 02:09:04.306]  And the word is, and this is pretty big news, is that they are preparing the big antitrust actions against Big Tech and others.
[02:09:04.886 --> 02:09:12.550]  That's why the Democrats announced today they're going to hold hearings as soon as they get in out of this lame-duck Republican Congress for the next two months.
[02:09:12.970 --> 02:09:14.171]  As soon as they get in.
[02:09:16.972 --> 02:09:17.993]  They're going to hold hearings.
[02:09:19.346 --> 02:09:33.796]  On Trump's treatment of the media saying he's authoritarian when the so-called corporate media is the murderer of truth, trying to shut down all the free press, and trying to shut down talk radio, and trying to shut down our funding.
[02:09:34.997 --> 02:09:38.459]  Those Republicans in those hearings should be able to destroy the Democrats.
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:41.621]  They're the ones trying to get rid of free speech in America.
[02:09:44.123 --> 02:09:48.366]  They had Democrat committees last year and this year say Matt Drudge should be shut down.
[02:09:51.078 --> 02:09:54.441]  Using the Federal Elections Commission, that I shouldn't be on the air!
[02:09:56.082 --> 02:09:58.904]  They have hearings about me, and I'm not called.
[02:09:59.464 --> 02:10:01.186]  That's never before been done in America.
[02:10:04.488 --> 02:10:07.851]  They were gonna have hearings about the Branch Davidians, the ones that weren't in prison were there.
[02:10:11.213 --> 02:10:14.256]  Think about how fundamentally screwed up our system is now.
[02:10:16.272 --> 02:10:22.474]  The Dallas Morning News and a whole bunch of other publications this week said, fire Sarah Huckabee Sanders and take Alex Jones off the air.
[02:10:22.534 --> 02:10:26.096]  The articles read like satire and none of them showed the video.
[02:10:26.396 --> 02:10:30.678]  See, at first they'd show it and say, look how it's doctored, the Acosta thing, and people went, it's not doctored.
[02:10:32.318 --> 02:10:33.479]  So now they just don't show it.
[02:10:34.739 --> 02:10:39.561]  Every late night comic show, every program, Alex Jones is bad, he's a liar, take him off the air.
[02:10:39.941 --> 02:10:44.843]  He did this, he's a white supremacist, he's a... These people are dangerous, because you know why they're dangerous?
[02:10:46.892 --> 02:10:48.573]  They work in unison, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:49.033 --> 02:10:59.099]  Only Motherboard, Vice, and RedState talk to known Ph.D.
[02:10:59.179 --> 02:10:59.859]  video editors.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:02.081]  You need a Ph.D.
[02:11:02.141 --> 02:11:03.241]  for that, but that's what they want to.
[02:11:03.341 --> 02:11:04.302]  They said, no, it's not edited.
[02:11:05.282 --> 02:11:05.863]  It's blown up.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:09.222]  And it's crappy on Twitter, so there's some drop frames.
[02:11:09.242 --> 02:11:09.602]  That's normal.
[02:11:09.622 --> 02:11:12.164]  And there's not just two drop frames when he karate chops.
[02:11:12.424 --> 02:11:13.605]  They claim it's showing his speed up.
[02:11:13.666 --> 02:11:14.266]  No, it doesn't.
[02:11:14.646 --> 02:11:15.367]  It's the same amount of time.
[02:11:15.387 --> 02:11:16.288]  It just blurs the image.
[02:11:17.128 --> 02:11:17.829]  For a millisecond.
[02:11:18.910 --> 02:11:20.031]  So the hand's a little blurry.
[02:11:20.471 --> 02:11:21.072]  That's what it does.
[02:11:21.132 --> 02:11:21.772]  It interlaces.
[02:11:21.832 --> 02:11:22.993]  It just mixes them together.
[02:11:25.075 --> 02:11:26.196]  They had to admit it was not doctored.
[02:11:26.396 --> 02:11:27.837]  They, of course they knew it wasn't doctored.
[02:11:29.478 --> 02:11:30.039]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:11:31.656 --> 02:11:44.800]  Because Stephen Colbert and all these other shows, word for word, got the exact same script and all said the exact same words from CNN to the late night comedy shows to the Dallas Morning News.
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:46.521]  They all said, fire Huckabee Sanders.
[02:11:46.941 --> 02:11:50.562]  Jones sped it up, slowed it down, and edited it, and all the rest of it.
[02:11:50.582 --> 02:11:54.283]  You know, if I was going to edit video, can we pull up the thing I found on Reddit or the diary I found on Reddit?
[02:11:55.603 --> 02:11:56.784]  Somebody edited Acosta.
[02:11:57.484 --> 02:11:58.224]  It is doctored.
[02:11:58.644 --> 02:11:59.644]  Punching the intern.
[02:12:00.185 --> 02:12:00.905]  That's doctored!
[02:12:01.894 --> 02:12:02.574]  That's doctored.
[02:12:02.775 --> 02:12:05.476]  What you're about to see as a TV viewer is doctored.
[02:12:06.837 --> 02:12:07.677]  That's doctored.
[02:12:09.899 --> 02:12:12.020]  Look, I know the audience goes, this is a petty thing.
[02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:12.940]  Why are you covering?
[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:13.681]  It's not petty.
[02:12:13.721 --> 02:12:30.070]  When the entire corporate media, in unison, says that Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars lied to you, and then they show you the very video, and it's exactly what we said, and Acosta says he didn't touch her, that's next-level fraud.
[02:12:37.625 --> 02:12:39.246]  And so the big takeaway here is this.
[02:12:41.987 --> 02:12:43.108]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:12:43.208 --> 02:12:46.690]  Trump now gets that the Democrats can't be reasoned with.
[02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:48.210]  They work for the CHICOMS and others.
[02:12:48.871 --> 02:13:00.977]  Their religion, their operating system, their reason for being, their ethos is not Jesus Christ or Americana or God, guts and guns or rugged individualism.
[02:13:01.717 --> 02:13:02.458]  Their ethos
[02:13:03.991 --> 02:13:11.817]  is authoritarianism and the American system and its prowess and its cornucopia of production they can't compete with.
[02:13:11.877 --> 02:13:19.542]  So their reason for existence is destroying Christians and America and Europe.
[02:13:21.483 --> 02:13:21.984]  They admit it.
[02:13:22.024 --> 02:13:23.245]  That's what's taught at universities.
[02:13:25.366 --> 02:13:27.047]  Because they are the conquering force.
[02:13:27.448 --> 02:13:30.670]  Not the poor immigrants they brainwash and bring in and weaponize.
[02:13:32.329 --> 02:13:37.273]  But the people running it have decided to be pure evil.
[02:13:38.273 --> 02:13:40.095]  They have decided to cheat at every level.
[02:13:40.835 --> 02:13:44.038]  They have decided to join the dark side.
[02:13:46.764 --> 02:13:47.865]  And you need to understand that.
[02:13:48.265 --> 02:13:55.170]  You can't approach them at any level like they're rational, or you're being nice, or you virtue signal.
[02:13:55.470 --> 02:14:07.658]  You meet them with, you are the enemy, you are scum, and you are out to enslave me, you are a would-be usurper, you want to conquer me, and when they try to guilt you and manipulate you because they're sociopaths, say, get behind me, you rat!
[02:14:08.218 --> 02:14:09.419]  Don't you ever speak to me!
[02:14:09.759 --> 02:14:15.463]  And you don't buy food at their stores, you don't stay at their hotels, anything globalist, anything leftist.
[02:14:16.964 --> 02:14:18.926]  Totally cut yourself off from them.
[02:14:18.946 --> 02:14:18.926]  100%.
[02:14:19.567 --> 02:14:26.233]  We don't go out and take their bank accounts away and take their websites away like they do to us, these horrible, dangerous authoritarians.
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:33.584]  That's what Soros was doing when he was 15 years old, rounding up Jews and, you know, taking away everything they had and killing them.
[02:14:33.865 --> 02:14:34.845]  Shipping them off to be dead.
[02:14:34.885 --> 02:14:44.633]  Let me tell you, he'd line you and your family up in a minute and shove a .45 in their mouth and blow their brains all over the wall if he could, because that makes him feel... over.
[02:14:44.653 --> 02:14:45.114]  You understand?
[02:14:45.154 --> 02:14:48.316]  He has a spirit that wants to run you into the ground.
[02:14:51.359 --> 02:14:53.981]  He wants to destroy you and his wicked little son.
[02:14:56.468 --> 02:15:02.073]  And all these people, the Chi-Coms, and Yunker, and Hillary Clinton, these are all really bad people.
[02:15:02.093 --> 02:15:03.635]  They're the worst of the worst.
[02:15:05.496 --> 02:15:07.498]  We've had rotten corruption for a long time.
[02:15:08.359 --> 02:15:16.546]  But we didn't have people that wanted to literally destroy prosperity, and who literally love ugliness, and love poverty.
[02:15:17.538 --> 02:15:23.144]  Everywhere that Soros controls things collapse and there's starvation and little children with their ribs sticking out.
[02:15:23.624 --> 02:15:29.570]  To Soros, little kids starving to death and dying in their own feces is the most beautiful thing on earth to him.
[02:15:30.111 --> 02:15:36.017]  A starving child with a crow as it's dying gasping from saying mama but it can't talk.
[02:15:37.618 --> 02:15:41.001]  A black bird pulling an eye out and gobbling it.
[02:15:41.402 --> 02:15:45.325]  I mean, to Soros, that is to him, that is like a beautiful sunset.
[02:15:45.346 --> 02:15:50.811]  You have to understand, he wants to rip your children's eyes out as they die and eat them.
[02:15:51.251 --> 02:15:51.992]  And I'm serious.
[02:15:55.424 --> 02:15:56.785]  My message to the President is this.
[02:15:57.405 --> 02:16:02.428]  I respect you, you've done incredible work, despite all these balls and chains tied around your ankles.
[02:16:02.988 --> 02:16:13.434]  But if you don't get these people off your back, and these corrupt mobsters and these criminals that have blocked America's recovery, then you become someone aiding and abetting the system, and I can only believe they've gotten to you.
[02:16:13.894 --> 02:16:24.740]  So in the next chapter, get ready, because the Republicans better get off their asses and take action to defend this country, or they are going to be seen as part of the problem.
[02:16:27.847 --> 02:16:38.196]  It is only the development and the advent of a robust alternative media based in the Internet that allowed for your election, Mr. President.
[02:16:38.776 --> 02:16:45.242]  You out-communicated the networks and the mainstream media through the Internet.
[02:16:45.462 --> 02:16:46.723]  That's how you won.
[02:16:47.023 --> 02:16:48.545]  And you were a master at it.
[02:16:49.205 --> 02:16:54.346]  Now, they want to put the toothpaste back in the tube, and you've seen the impact in this election.
[02:16:54.946 --> 02:17:05.368]  Allowing the Democrats to take control of Facebook, which is the single most important effective tool in a local congressional race, was a death wish.
[02:17:05.988 --> 02:17:09.069]  Where was the complaint from the Republican National Committee?
[02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:13.110]  Which, sir, you control, and you could have made happen.
[02:17:13.290 --> 02:17:14.790]  And they thought you were so ignorant,
[02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.450]  I think?
[02:17:35.976 --> 02:17:48.000]  Let's be clear, it's not just the right thing to do, it's also a way to change the narrative from the squeamish, anemic victory the Democrats just had, thanks to Republican ineptness.
[02:18:01.284 --> 02:18:04.327]  He needs to, tomorrow, fire them to change the narrative.
[02:18:04.347 --> 02:18:12.634]  Having tasted this narrow victory tonight, the Democrats will, and their tech giant allies, will push internet censorship even further.
[02:18:12.915 --> 02:18:15.037]  That's more decapitations at Facebook.
[02:18:15.377 --> 02:18:18.820]  That's more censorship at Twitter and Reddit.
[02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:23.184]  And that is the eradication of InfoWars from the face of the planet.
[02:18:25.430 --> 02:18:30.692]  The body that uses a medicinal herb of thousands of years, turmeric, is one of the most studied ingredients known today.
[02:18:31.092 --> 02:18:36.414]  It is there for the joint support, mobility support, flexibility support, inflammation support, immune support.
[02:18:36.594 --> 02:18:44.757]  And it's got the turmeric root extract, the boswellia serrata extract, organic spearmint, sage, lemon balm, thyme leaves, and piperine from black pepper.
[02:18:45.118 --> 02:18:50.039]  It will help you take control of your body and feel the power of turmeric like never before.

[02:19:52.824 --> 02:20:00.530]  A preacher man says it's the end of time.
[02:20:17.130 --> 02:20:19.432]  The last thing they want you to be is self-sufficient.
[02:20:45.250 --> 02:20:49.053]  Whether you live in a city, or whether you live in a small town, or whether you live out in the middle of the desert.
[02:20:50.734 --> 02:20:56.418]  I've got a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive, and a country boy can survive.
[02:20:57.599 --> 02:21:00.561]  Country folks can survive.
[02:21:00.601 --> 02:21:02.942]  Boy, I tell you, people are watching television right now.
[02:21:03.443 --> 02:21:05.524]  Watching our transmission, they're seeing something.
[02:21:06.165 --> 02:21:08.486]  I can plow a field all day long.
[02:21:08.566 --> 02:21:11.649]  I can catch catfish from dusk till dawn.
[02:21:11.749 --> 02:21:12.189]  Oh boy.
[02:21:17.246 --> 02:21:22.689]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[02:21:25.030 --> 02:21:26.751]  We can build a resistance to the globalists.
[02:21:28.072 --> 02:21:29.473]  We can relaunch the renaissance.
[02:21:29.973 --> 02:21:32.094]  We can defeat the enemy with culture.
[02:21:32.114 --> 02:21:36.897]  If the average person really gets motivated and really gets involved.
[02:21:37.337 --> 02:21:40.178]  But it comes down to us who you can't starve out.
[02:21:41.499 --> 02:21:42.620]  Who you can't make run.
[02:21:45.455 --> 02:21:51.336]  But you know, the average person, I know people personally who know that the litmus test, it's a statement.
[02:21:52.356 --> 02:21:53.336]  You have to read on air.
[02:21:55.057 --> 02:21:59.077]  George Soros never collaborated with the Nazis.
[02:21:59.097 --> 02:22:00.678]  That's a lie by Alex Jones.
[02:22:01.198 --> 02:22:02.978]  He survived the Holocaust.
[02:22:03.618 --> 02:22:04.959]  He's a philanthropist.
[02:22:08.279 --> 02:22:12.940]  You say that, you get boosted on Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[02:22:15.384 --> 02:22:17.465]  But you do that, you sign on to this right here.
[02:22:18.206 --> 02:22:19.046]  That's how evil works.
[02:22:20.307 --> 02:22:28.351]  You sign on with somebody like him, you might as well be his companies that are known for destroying African currencies and causing mass starvation.
[02:22:28.672 --> 02:22:30.252]  Same thing in Europe, Latin America.
[02:22:33.774 --> 02:22:35.235]  He says someone else would do it.
[02:22:35.575 --> 02:22:36.256]  It's markets.
[02:22:37.515 --> 02:22:38.655]  I don't feel bad at all.
[02:22:38.675 --> 02:22:40.636]  It was happy making, helping Roundup Jews.
[02:22:41.256 --> 02:22:45.318]  I did not do it because I would have been hurt if I didn't, so I did not do it.
[02:22:45.738 --> 02:22:47.759]  I simply filled a space.
[02:22:51.120 --> 02:22:52.781]  It was actually the best time of my life.
[02:22:55.722 --> 02:22:58.903]  And to say it here on 60 Minutes rubs it in, does it not?
[02:23:03.344 --> 02:23:04.625]  Someone has to do it, right?
[02:23:06.571 --> 02:23:10.074]  Someone with a Transylvanian type accent, perhaps?
[02:23:12.976 --> 02:23:14.437]  Perhaps someone like that, huh?
[02:23:15.618 --> 02:23:16.378]  My father.
[02:23:16.398 --> 02:23:18.800]  I will go out with my father.
[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:22.583]  And we will round people up with my father.
[02:23:24.024 --> 02:23:27.666]  My father was always, always with me.
[02:23:30.589 --> 02:23:33.651]  Let's get off the subject of George Soros, but let's leave that image up.
[02:23:35.455 --> 02:23:38.959]  That's a real image, by the way, with Soros superimposed over it.
[02:23:40.620 --> 02:23:42.122]  I think to Dramatica effect.
[02:23:45.425 --> 02:23:49.229]  See, I'm like a tyranny-seeking missile, spiritually and politically.
[02:23:51.011 --> 02:23:52.953]  And I just can't help but hone into it.
[02:23:54.535 --> 02:23:55.436]  That's what we hone in on.
[02:23:55.776 --> 02:23:56.757]  Where's the most attack?
[02:23:56.777 --> 02:23:57.297]  And I go, oh!
[02:23:58.106 --> 02:23:59.946]  Over here, you know, it doesn't hurt my feelings.
[02:23:59.967 --> 02:24:02.667]  People I've known for many, many years that say, oh, I'm going to have you on my show.
[02:24:03.027 --> 02:24:03.687]  And then they don't.
[02:24:04.548 --> 02:24:09.029]  It's that the litmus test of saying George Soros is a great guy.
[02:24:11.189 --> 02:24:13.190]  Those people become dead, basically, to you.
[02:24:15.611 --> 02:24:19.332]  And then you get to see them held up to the world as the good guys.
[02:24:20.772 --> 02:24:21.812]  Happy making time.
[02:24:22.893 --> 02:24:24.573]  It was happy making for me.
[02:24:26.806 --> 02:24:29.067]  Happy making, happy making.
[02:24:35.990 --> 02:24:41.992]  Okay, I'm kind of waxing esoteric here today.
[02:24:42.793 --> 02:24:44.473]  I'm going to take your phone for the next few segments.
[02:24:44.493 --> 02:24:45.534]  I'm going to go right to your calls.
[02:24:46.994 --> 02:24:53.017]  But you can call a long-time caller, first-time caller, somebody that sat on hold and told me, I'll go to you first.
[02:24:54.858 --> 02:25:02.082]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 877-789-2539.
[02:25:02.102 --> 02:25:06.784]  877-789-ALEX is the toll-free number to join us.
[02:25:06.804 --> 02:25:07.504]  877-789-2539.
[02:25:08.365 --> 02:25:11.546]  And we'll take your calls.
[02:25:13.667 --> 02:25:20.291]  It's a pretty big deal to have the world decry Trump for saying we deserve to have a nation-state and we need an EU empire.
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:27.784]  And a Chinese global chi-com empire that's unelected to rule us, or we're not good moral people.
[02:25:28.504 --> 02:25:39.671]  And then these big corporations and these big globalist operations that are against free market capitalism, they want crony, fascist, communist, whatever you want to call it, it uses every system, totally evil.
[02:25:42.132 --> 02:25:49.417]  To oppress everybody, and then it points at us saying, we're not going to let you give us one-sided raw deals, and they go, oh, you're so mean, you're mean!
[02:25:51.154 --> 02:25:52.895]  Let's play that Macron clip one more time.
[02:25:52.915 --> 02:25:58.117]  Because he says, patriotism is not standing up for your nation.
[02:25:59.998 --> 02:26:03.399]  Your culture, your history, your taxes, your institutions.
[02:26:03.839 --> 02:26:08.741]  It's just letting the IMF, the World Bank, the unelected EU, some other group tell you what to do.
[02:26:08.761 --> 02:26:17.185]  And then if you try to vote to get out of it, if you're France, or who never voted to be in the EU, or if you're the UK, oh you can't!
[02:26:18.206 --> 02:26:24.489]  That's right, it's really evil to say we shouldn't be under something we didn't vote to be under that says we can't get out of it.
[02:26:24.729 --> 02:26:30.291]  Oh, and now it wants a big army to stop nation states from leaving.
[02:26:30.652 --> 02:26:32.793]  I might have heard of that before happening.
[02:26:32.973 --> 02:26:35.774]  Oh, the Nazis had a plan for the EU.
[02:26:38.755 --> 02:26:39.576]  And now it's here.
[02:26:42.457 --> 02:26:46.819]  And Macron is up there saying we need an EU army last week to stop America.
[02:26:52.585 --> 02:26:55.387]  But what they really want is to stop nation states leaving.
[02:26:57.508 --> 02:26:58.649]  Oh, you're going to try to leave Italy?
[02:26:58.669 --> 02:27:02.971]  You're going to try to stop millions coming across the water that Soros openly funds?
[02:27:03.252 --> 02:27:11.617]  We're going to put the military in ships and stop your Italian Navy.
[02:27:13.100 --> 02:27:16.765]  This is an invasion, which I told you 20 years ago the EU would do.
[02:27:16.945 --> 02:27:20.389]  The EU army planned the EU court to stop the nation states from leaving.
[02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:23.173]  They plan to suck those countries dry all along.
[02:27:23.393 --> 02:27:24.695]  We have the whole battle plan.
[02:27:25.496 --> 02:27:25.977]  Here's Macron.
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:42.525]  This vision of France as a generous nation, with a vision which carries universal values, has been, in those dark times, exactly the opposite of the selfishness of a people which only looks at its own interests.
[02:27:43.605 --> 02:27:47.086]  Because patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism.
[02:27:49.291 --> 02:27:51.233]  Nationalism is its betrayal.
[02:27:52.214 --> 02:28:05.784]  By pursuing our own interests first, with no regard to others, we erase the very thing that a nation holds most precious, that which gives it life and makes it great, its moral values.
[02:28:07.426 --> 02:28:16.293]  Now the finance minister, the technocrat that really runs France, is saying we need a military for an empire.
[02:28:17.961 --> 02:28:19.002]  So, an empire.
[02:28:19.102 --> 02:28:20.222]  Now, that's right.
[02:28:20.322 --> 02:28:23.684]  We're going to have your nations be vassal states of our empire.
[02:28:23.704 --> 02:28:27.706]  We're going to bring in giant third world populations to drive down your wages.
[02:28:27.726 --> 02:28:32.628]  And then we can snap our fingers, we politically control them, and they'll burn your cities down.
[02:28:33.148 --> 02:28:35.530]  So this is how you conquer nations in the 21st century.
[02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:38.751]  Macron wants 500 million.
[02:28:38.771 --> 02:28:39.331]  That's ISIS.
[02:28:39.351 --> 02:28:40.272]  He wants 200 million.
[02:28:40.592 --> 02:28:43.654]  And the UN wants 600 million illegal aliens to be brought into the US.
[02:28:44.154 --> 02:28:46.315]  That's all from UN documents.
[02:28:47.489 --> 02:28:48.231]  That's right, folks.
[02:28:48.331 --> 02:28:49.454]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:49.554 --> 02:28:50.656]  Tomorrow's news today.

[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:53.282]  NewsWars.com.
[02:28:53.342 --> 02:28:54.244]  NewsWars.com.
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:16.701]  Joining us for this segment is George Papanopoulos, who I did say back during the time when the whole Russiagate thing started, I said he might be one of the double agents just because the story sounded so ridiculous that he talked to somebody connected to Russians in a bar in Italy and then that made him a Russian agent and he was, you know, pleading guilty or whatever.
[02:29:16.761 --> 02:29:17.682]  I said that's asinine.
[02:29:17.722 --> 02:29:18.963]  Alex, thanks so much for hosting me.
[02:29:19.123 --> 02:29:20.064]  It's a real pleasure.
[02:29:20.084 --> 02:29:21.324]  No, you're absolutely right, Luke.
[02:29:21.384 --> 02:29:24.827]  I think I used to be patient zero, I guess, of the fantasy of Russia collusion.
[02:29:24.847 --> 02:29:26.348]  And unfortunately, I was patient zero.
[02:29:42.739 --> 02:29:43.099]  I think so.
[02:29:57.916 --> 02:30:03.900]  In 2016, I'm on a business trip to Rome, and I meet this man named Joseph Nibseth.
[02:30:03.920 --> 02:30:05.181]  He's a Maltese professor.
[02:30:05.241 --> 02:30:11.325]  This professor, a month later, he drops this information on me that the Russians apparently have Hillary Clinton's emails.
[02:30:11.445 --> 02:30:13.947]  Now, I didn't understand what he was really, you know, talking.
[02:30:13.967 --> 02:30:19.251]  It was openly rumored that Clinton's State Department server had been hacked, so he drops this information on me.
[02:30:19.291 --> 02:30:24.394]  About a week later, the Alexander Downer from the Australian Embassy wants to meet with
[02:30:24.714 --> 02:30:26.495]  And during this meeting, he's recording me.
[02:30:26.555 --> 02:30:28.436]  He's asking me very strange questions.
[02:30:28.496 --> 02:30:32.179]  He's telling me that the Australians are watching what Trump is doing.
[02:30:32.219 --> 02:30:37.001]  The British are watching him very closely because of his support for Brexit and that he's a pariah.
[02:30:37.101 --> 02:30:41.284]  Now, this guy, I have absolutely no memory of ever talking about emails with him.
[02:30:41.384 --> 02:30:46.767]  Apparently, he created this fake story that I talked about emails with him to justify this investigation.
[02:30:46.827 --> 02:30:47.868]  That's the current narrative.
[02:30:47.928 --> 02:30:53.151]  I mean, it's a lot more complicated than anybody could possibly think, but I'm just trying to lay out the groundwork.
[02:30:53.251 --> 02:30:53.851]  It's very simple.
[02:30:53.911 --> 02:30:55.632]  They want to discredit the election of Trump.
[02:30:56.392 --> 02:30:59.433]  They want to be able to cover up their illegal spying on Trump, which has now all been confirmed.
[02:30:59.933 --> 02:31:17.197]  And so they had different MI6 and CIA operatives and actual agents come up and talk to different Trump people about Russians so that they had some type of connection to people in the Trump operation and Russians even though they were the ones instigating it and even though you were faithful to the United States.
[02:31:17.277 --> 02:31:19.298]  To this day, I've never traveled to Russia.
[02:31:22.193 --> 02:31:28.696]  And then they use that when they're already legally spying to parallel construct and go then open the official investigation into Trump using you.
[02:32:05.592 --> 02:32:11.856]  After the success of Alpha Power, we decided to make a new powerhouse vitality formula built with the female biochemistry in mind.

[02:32:59.355 --> 02:33:02.096]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.083 --> 02:33:22.605]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.625 --> 02:33:28.668]  I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing till they got a hold of me.
[02:33:40.259 --> 02:33:41.264]  I don't know.
[02:33:54.920 --> 02:33:57.901]  Nobody ever said it was easy to fight authoritarians.
[02:33:58.882 --> 02:34:07.845]  But all of us who have basic freedoms and civilization can thank men and women who stood up and did the right thing and made incredible sacrifices.
[02:34:08.385 --> 02:34:10.506]  Politically, physically, spiritually, economically.
[02:34:11.446 --> 02:34:15.508]  And so I'm extremely honored to be demonized, to be one of the most demonized people in the world.
[02:34:17.062 --> 02:34:24.906]  By these mega-corporations that own slave factories, that engage in the most horrible criminal activity you can imagine, that don't pay taxes.
[02:34:25.686 --> 02:34:45.915]  And now, as world government's being announced, and as borders are being collapsed by the UN, and hundreds of millions of people are being told, migrate to the West, so they can come in and use our voting system to absolutely enslave us, they are all over the place demonizing nation-states, and families, and mother, and father.
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:54.741]  Because you can't have a nation state where you have due process and a Bill of Rights and a Constitution or where you paid in money and you get your pension back.
[02:34:54.821 --> 02:34:55.601]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:57.282 --> 02:34:58.562]  Nationalism is evil.
[02:34:58.602 --> 02:34:59.882]  Having countries is evil.
[02:35:00.783 --> 02:35:04.643]  So Trump comes out a few weeks ago and says nationalism is good to have your own country.
[02:35:05.163 --> 02:35:10.444]  You don't want to have some unelected EU running your life or some unelected TPP running your life that he pulled out of.
[02:35:11.585 --> 02:35:15.605]  Some authoritarian system that you can't even call.
[02:35:15.645 --> 02:35:16.566]  You can't even sue.
[02:35:16.926 --> 02:35:17.926]  The meetings are secret.
[02:35:19.175 --> 02:35:20.076]  The EU was unelected.
[02:35:20.096 --> 02:35:21.296]  People didn't even vote to enter it.
[02:35:21.596 --> 02:35:29.561]  And now, Macron comes out over the weekend and criticizes the President to his face and England for pulling out of the EU.
[02:35:30.561 --> 02:35:35.344]  And says nationalism is the opposite of patriotism.
[02:35:35.744 --> 02:35:39.566]  Now that is, that is totally and completely idiotic, isn't it?
[02:35:40.187 --> 02:35:41.547]  Let's pull up the London Telegraph.
[02:35:42.728 --> 02:35:44.069]  London Independent, they've all got it.
[02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:47.931]  The EU was the brain trust and the plan
[02:35:49.218 --> 02:35:50.079]  of Adolf Hitler.
[02:35:51.762 --> 02:35:56.549]  After he was defeated, the Marshall Plan picked it up, and the plan just continued.
[02:35:57.851 --> 02:35:59.754]  Nazis created a basic plan for European Union.
[02:36:01.547 --> 02:36:02.308]  That is a fact.
[02:36:02.828 --> 02:36:08.213]  And now they say this unelected thing is better than Germany or France or Sweden.
[02:36:08.794 --> 02:36:10.315]  And now the nation states are trying to pull out.
[02:36:10.336 --> 02:36:14.299]  They're saying, we're not going to be under the UN treaty that says our borders are wide open and they run it.
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:17.763]  So Austria and Hungary are pulling out and Italy's pulling out.
[02:36:17.803 --> 02:36:19.464]  So they're like, well, we're going to have an EU army.
[02:36:20.404 --> 02:36:21.805]  That comes in and stops you.
[02:36:21.845 --> 02:36:24.567]  That's the finance minister of France.
[02:36:24.707 --> 02:36:25.828]  You're not getting away.
[02:36:26.329 --> 02:36:29.331]  We're forming an army that'll stop your army.
[02:36:30.012 --> 02:36:31.213]  Oh, I think we heard of that.
[02:36:31.313 --> 02:36:32.173]  Hitler's plan.
[02:36:32.814 --> 02:36:36.937]  An EU army to keep the European Union in line.
[02:36:39.099 --> 02:36:40.500]  This is the reality.
[02:36:42.942 --> 02:36:44.363]  And Trump is trying to fight it.
[02:36:45.004 --> 02:36:46.745]  This is the new authoritarianism.
[02:36:47.306 --> 02:36:48.727]  So, on the heels of that,
[02:36:50.137 --> 02:36:51.818]  Nationalism is bad speech.
[02:36:52.318 --> 02:36:53.398]  TV brainwashing.
[02:36:54.639 --> 02:37:03.903]  Secretary Elizabeth McCord delivers a thought-provoking speech in season 5 premiere episode of E Pluribus Unum.
[02:37:04.743 --> 02:37:06.764]  Madam Secretary on Sundays.
[02:37:06.784 --> 02:37:10.585]  10 Eastern, 9 Central on CBS.
[02:37:11.326 --> 02:37:16.648]  All unifying the propaganda that the nation state is bad.
[02:37:16.708 --> 02:37:17.168]  Here it is.
[02:37:18.969 --> 02:37:19.629]  Madam Secretary.
[02:37:21.887 --> 02:37:25.371]  Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Prime Minister Khadri.
[02:37:25.391 --> 02:37:32.938]  Prime Minister Wadeli, your courage and determination have made humankind safer from the second greatest threat it faces.
[02:37:35.100 --> 02:37:38.423]  What is an even greater threat than nuclear weapons?
[02:37:40.084 --> 02:37:42.727]  That which makes the use of them possible.
[02:37:42.747 --> 02:37:44.088]  Hate.
[02:37:45.499 --> 02:37:51.085]  Specifically, the blind hatred one group or nation can have for another.
[02:37:51.966 --> 02:37:57.292]  And that is why I am convinced that nationalism is the existential threat of our time.
[02:37:58.453 --> 02:38:02.998]  I want to be clear, nationalism is not the same as patriotism.
[02:38:03.638 --> 02:38:05.901]  It's a perversion of patriotism.
[02:38:07.085 --> 02:38:15.033]  Nationalism, the belief system held by those who attacked us, promotes the idea that inclusion and diversity represent weakness.
[02:38:15.733 --> 02:38:22.960]  That the only way to succeed is to give blind allegiance to the supremacy of one race over all others.
[02:38:23.761 --> 02:38:25.582]  Nothing could be less American.
[02:38:25.603 --> 02:38:26.243]  Now hit pause.
[02:38:26.643 --> 02:38:27.785]  I can't listen to any more of this.
[02:38:28.005 --> 02:38:29.806]  This is exactly what Macron just said.
[02:38:30.976 --> 02:38:31.857]  They're the globalists.
[02:38:31.917 --> 02:38:33.498]  They have the Nazi EU system.
[02:38:33.598 --> 02:38:34.499]  They're taking over.
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:40.204]  They funded the Arab Spring to blow away moderate regimes and put in radical Islamic ones.
[02:38:41.085 --> 02:38:47.311]  They're the ones saying you can't have your family, you can't have your free market, you can't be a Christian, you've got to do what we say.
[02:38:47.471 --> 02:38:50.774]  Don't use mother and father, or boy or girl in school forums.
[02:38:50.834 --> 02:38:52.556]  They're the ones saying we can have no identity.
[02:38:54.878 --> 02:38:57.320]  While they then bring in the third world to politically control them.
[02:38:59.534 --> 02:39:04.739]  This is so sick, and it's just everywhere, and it's bombarding people everywhere.
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:07.402]  Of course patriotism is about your nation.
[02:39:07.722 --> 02:39:12.928]  Strong, good nation, good people, limited laws, resources, strong people, vibrant.
[02:39:13.689 --> 02:39:21.056]  Other nations falling apart, run by collectivists, run by globalists, being looted, and America's halfway there.
[02:39:21.960 --> 02:39:45.492]  We try to pull out and the entire corporate media begins this attack on the idea of a nation-state to counter national nation-state movements all over the world, saying no to an unelected EU coming in and opening its borders to collapsing Africa and the Middle East, which the globalists collapsed on purpose to then collapse Europe and the United States.
[02:39:46.414 --> 02:39:47.775]  I've got the articles right here from Macron.
[02:39:48.095 --> 02:39:51.997]  Wants 200 million North Africans to come to Europe and France.
[02:39:53.138 --> 02:39:55.779]  Macron walks back his migration talk.
[02:39:57.540 --> 02:40:00.282]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[02:40:00.662 --> 02:40:02.663]  This is their stated plan.
[02:40:03.817 --> 02:40:05.018]  I'm going to go to your calls in the next segment.
[02:40:05.038 --> 02:40:07.920]  This is very hard to stomach, but let's try to finish watching this.
[02:40:07.940 --> 02:40:10.342]  Can you imagine the type of idiots that watch and believe this?
[02:40:10.623 --> 02:40:17.228]  The type that watch Colbert say that I, that Infowars, that Paul Watson faked a video that Acosta never touched her!
[02:40:18.029 --> 02:40:19.570]  And then he shows the video of him touching her!
[02:40:20.191 --> 02:40:20.971]  And says it's fake!
[02:40:21.151 --> 02:40:21.512]  What the?
[02:40:22.970 --> 02:40:24.811]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[02:40:24.851 --> 02:40:25.291]  Here it is.
[02:40:25.871 --> 02:40:34.113]  Patriotism, on the other hand, is about building each other up and embracing our diversity as the source of our nation's strength.
[02:40:34.473 --> 02:40:37.354]  We the people means all the people.
[02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:37.714]  Hit pause again.
[02:40:37.734 --> 02:40:39.134]  Yeah, the name of the show, E Pluribus Unum.
[02:40:39.655 --> 02:40:40.855]  Unified by the Republic.
[02:40:41.595 --> 02:40:45.316]  All they're creating is racial and religious division, the left is, but then saying they're against it.
[02:40:46.877 --> 02:40:51.858]  And then trying to tell people, if you're not white, you're not part of the club, but with the Democrats and globalism, you are.
[02:40:52.898 --> 02:40:53.659]  Man, this is sick.
[02:40:53.719 --> 02:40:54.960]  And listen to the bad acting.
[02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:55.420]  Continue.
[02:40:56.321 --> 02:40:59.343]  America's heroes didn't die for race or region.
[02:40:59.924 --> 02:41:03.347]  They died for the ideals enshrined in our Constitution.
[02:41:03.647 --> 02:41:03.967]  Pause.
[02:41:04.388 --> 02:41:07.310]  Which the Democrats are constantly trying to overthrow and get rid of.
[02:41:07.330 --> 02:41:11.033]  I mean, every millisecond of this is pure crap.
[02:41:11.073 --> 02:41:11.434]  Continue.
[02:41:13.035 --> 02:41:18.580]  Freedom from tyranny, which requires our unwavering support of the free press.
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:20.581]  Unwavering support for the globalists.
[02:41:21.906 --> 02:41:26.309]  Remember whenever Obama said, and, and, and, and don't, I can't do a good Obama.
[02:41:26.649 --> 02:41:29.650]  People say there's always tyranny right around the corner and always don't listen to them.
[02:41:30.091 --> 02:41:34.553]  You have the EU saying countries can't leave that never entered it by vote.
[02:41:34.873 --> 02:41:40.317]  You have major governments in Sweden and England saying take microchips to buy and sell.
[02:41:40.997 --> 02:41:45.660]  We have total world government upon us and this is the crap we get.
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:46.060]  Continue.
[02:41:47.806 --> 02:41:56.172]  ...all religions, the right to vote, and making sure nothing infringes on any of those rights which belong to us all.
[02:41:56.632 --> 02:41:57.573]  That means that's Code for Illegality.
[02:41:57.593 --> 02:42:01.396]  Look, your isolationism has gotten us in the past... Oh wait, pause.
[02:42:01.476 --> 02:42:04.298]  Look at that idiot actor, that's supposed to look like David Brock.
[02:42:04.518 --> 02:42:05.639]  Oh my gosh, continue.
[02:42:08.408 --> 02:42:10.770]  Two world wars, 70 million dead.
[02:42:11.351 --> 02:42:11.871]  Oh my god.
[02:42:12.692 --> 02:42:22.259]  Never again can we go back to those dark times when fear and hatred, like a contagion, infected the world.
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:23.821]  The MLF funds the Arab Spring.
[02:42:24.301 --> 02:42:28.925]  That, as much as ending the threat of nuclear war, is what today is about.
[02:42:29.265 --> 02:42:30.446]  Ending the threat of nuclear war.
[02:42:30.486 --> 02:42:33.567]  It's why we must never lose sight of our common humanity.
[02:42:34.087 --> 02:42:35.007]  Our common values.
[02:42:35.027 --> 02:42:38.789]  Our common humanity to lay it out of the UN and the EU and the chi-coms.
[02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:45.832]  You don't see a show on CBS about Apple having slave factories and helping round up Christians and kill them.
[02:42:45.912 --> 02:42:50.354]  No, no, no, it's just a woman lecturing, and our love, and we're so good.
[02:42:50.374 --> 02:42:54.776]  No, you're the devilish evil left that wants to devour America, witch.
[02:42:59.775 --> 02:43:03.697]  We need to go back and revisit the foundations of our freedom.
[02:43:05.418 --> 02:43:08.419]  Our freedoms don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper.
[02:43:08.539 --> 02:43:10.560]  It consists of the things that we're willing to fight for.
[02:43:11.221 --> 02:43:15.063]  The First Amendment, the Bill of Rights, the rest of the Bill of Rights are prohibitions.
[02:43:15.523 --> 02:43:22.867]  They're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking those God-given rights from us as individuals.
[02:43:22.887 --> 02:43:25.428]  You better understand that because they're taking them right now.
[02:43:28.866 --> 02:43:31.047]  We have seen what they want to do.
[02:43:31.087 --> 02:43:34.269]  They called it UN Agenda 21, now they call it the UN 2030 Agenda.
[02:43:34.509 --> 02:43:45.236]  They want everybody off of the rural lands, they want people out of the suburbs, they want to pack everybody into the cities, because that's where it is easiest for them to control everyone.
[02:43:48.298 --> 02:43:50.499]  Never miss your show, any day.
[02:43:50.559 --> 02:43:51.740]  I mean, what?
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:53.221]  I mean, never!
[02:44:00.600 --> 02:44:05.749]  Hey guys, my name is Savannah Hernandez, and if you're always on the go like me, then you're not always tied to your computer or TV.
[02:44:06.109 --> 02:44:08.213]  So we just released our free InfoWars official app.
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:19.148]  The InfoWars official app includes all of our live broadcasts like War Room with Owen Troyer, Real News with David Knight, and the holy grail of podcasts and radio, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:19.508 --> 02:44:25.733]  And the best part about the InfoWars official app is that every single time we go live, you get notifications so that you never miss a beat.
[02:44:26.234 --> 02:44:31.038]  So whether you're in the car or on a run, this app makes it easy to keep the InfoWars right in your pocket.
[02:44:31.478 --> 02:44:32.399]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:44:32.959 --> 02:44:34.902]  Not so fast, InfoWars.
[02:44:35.263 --> 02:44:36.685]  Apple banned your app.
[02:44:36.885 --> 02:44:38.527]  I helped, too!
[02:44:38.908 --> 02:44:39.329]  Ah, Oliver.
[02:44:47.065 --> 02:44:48.286]  We hate free speech too!
[02:44:48.687 --> 02:44:50.408]  We hate free speech!
[02:44:50.609 --> 02:44:52.210]  We hate free speech!
[02:44:52.330 --> 02:44:53.992]  We hate free speech!
[02:44:54.172 --> 02:44:55.814]  We hate free speech!
[02:44:55.934 --> 02:45:01.860]  In a time where your body is constantly under attack by outside toxins, irregularity can be a nightmare.
[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:11.049]  That's why InfoWars Life created Regulize Complete to relieve intestinal issues in a gentle way, often a result of poor diet and lifestyle habits.
[02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:14.672]  An occasionally constipated colon can cause massive problems.
[02:45:14.992 --> 02:45:21.198]  Our researchers combined ancient ingredients traditionally used to combat these issues in an affordable way.
[02:45:21.458 --> 02:45:27.543]  Other harsh, stimulant laxatives can create massive discomfort in trying to solve intestinal issues.
[02:45:28.024 --> 02:45:35.010]  But Regulize Complete was made to be taken in a daily overnight colon cleanse to help you reach optimal gut and colon health.
[02:45:35.290 --> 02:45:38.873]  Our gentle, natural laxative, unlike other laxative products,
[02:45:39.293 --> 02:45:42.115]  Arlo Dose is safe enough for year-round consumption.
[02:45:42.315 --> 02:45:46.718]  Don't let intestinal distress and occasional constipation get the jump on you.
[02:45:47.198 --> 02:45:54.562]  Start your choline cleansing for a healthier, happier gut today with Regulize Complete, available at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:45:55.723 --> 02:46:02.487]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars Life has the formula for you.
[02:46:03.188 --> 02:46:11.874]  Ultimate Krill Oil is a powerhouse formula that takes advantages of the EPA, DHA, and Omega-3s found in our high-quality, ultra-pure krill oil concentrate.
[02:46:12.454 --> 02:46:21.520]  Containing powerful antioxidants such as astaxanthin and Omega-3s, Ultimate Krill Oil can help you experience the benefits of fish oil with less required DHA and EPA.
[02:46:22.475 --> 02:46:33.382]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health, and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function, and more.
[02:46:33.902 --> 02:46:43.008]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified, high-quality krill oil concentrate.
[02:46:43.488 --> 02:46:45.790]  Paired with our Ultimate Fish Oil or used separately.
[02:46:46.210 --> 02:46:49.592]  It's time to see what Krill Oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:46:49.872 --> 02:46:52.454]  Now available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:59.239 --> 02:47:01.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:26.835 --> 02:47:33.338]  Alright, I'm not going to belabor this, but Roger Stone wrote an article for Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:47:34.198 --> 02:47:35.299]  It's really, really important.
[02:47:36.119 --> 02:47:39.060]  Write to Trump now to stop Big Tech censoring you.
[02:47:39.921 --> 02:47:43.462]  And we already sent the President some information.
[02:47:43.802 --> 02:47:47.524]  And it's right on line with what the Constitution, Bill of Rights, best lawyers say.
[02:47:48.144 --> 02:47:51.526]  But some different attack plans that folks wouldn't think of, generally.
[02:47:52.966 --> 02:47:54.387]  And some key angles for the President.
[02:47:55.993 --> 02:48:05.958]  Like, Mr. President, the EU by extension with its regulations already regulating the internet, you need to come in with prohibitions blocking censorship and cartel activity.
[02:48:05.998 --> 02:48:07.619]  You saw him last week say just that.
[02:48:08.099 --> 02:48:13.962]  I had three different law firms put three different packages together with different angles and I got them to the President.
[02:48:15.783 --> 02:48:18.324]  And let's say all hell broke loose when I did.
[02:48:18.344 --> 02:48:20.365]  I mean, I get punished every time I do this.
[02:48:21.846 --> 02:48:22.687]  So write Trump.com.
[02:48:24.923 --> 02:48:31.046]  We're going to send a million, and I got over 100,000 signatures before and sent them to them, but those were digital.
[02:48:31.626 --> 02:48:33.828]  And we did deliver a pallet of them with single print.
[02:48:34.248 --> 02:48:35.128]  These are going to be in letters.
[02:48:35.168 --> 02:48:43.132]  I'm going to have a firm locally, one of those firms, package all the letters, print them off, mail them individually to the White House.
[02:48:43.633 --> 02:48:46.634]  But we're going to hit a bunch also that we're going to send to Trump Tower.
[02:48:46.654 --> 02:48:48.195]  We're going to send some to Mar-a-Lago.
[02:48:48.215 --> 02:48:48.835]  We can get just 100,000 here, 100,000 there.
[02:48:48.855 --> 02:48:49.276]  You know, 800,000 here.
[02:48:52.401 --> 02:48:58.145]  We've only gotten like 30,000 signatures, which is a lot in a week, but when you get excited, we got like 100,000 in a couple days.
[02:48:58.285 --> 02:48:59.306]  I want to send a million.
[02:49:00.126 --> 02:49:01.427]  So write trump.com.
[02:49:02.428 --> 02:49:03.289]  It's got a nice letter.
[02:49:03.809 --> 02:49:05.130]  You can also write what you want in there.
[02:49:05.770 --> 02:49:11.094]  You can print it off yourself and mail it, or just leave it up to us, but we will mail it to him physically.
[02:49:12.779 --> 02:49:17.440]  Doesn't cost that much, like six, seven, eight cents to get it packaged, and then like 20 cents to mail or something.
[02:49:17.860 --> 02:49:18.661]  Ridiculously low.
[02:49:19.441 --> 02:49:20.541]  And so we're going to do it.
[02:49:20.561 --> 02:49:25.883]  I mean, it'll cost a lot of money here, but I want to defend free speech, and I want him bathing in letters.
[02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:28.063]  Bathing in letters.
[02:49:28.083 --> 02:49:32.965]  And by the way, he spends what he has the time, up to an hour a day, late at night, pawing around in them.
[02:49:33.645 --> 02:49:39.887]  And believe me, if he gets thousands a week, well, we're gonna hit him with one million
[02:49:42.853 --> 02:49:43.634]  Did you quote Dr. Evil?
[02:49:45.255 --> 02:49:45.676]  How much?
[02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:48.599]  At least 1 million hand-delivered letters.
[02:49:50.100 --> 02:49:51.682]  So, writeTrump.com.
[02:49:52.422 --> 02:50:01.571]  Also, coming up next hour, I'm going to host a little bit of the next hour with our guest host that's coming up, Mike Adams, but video, Muslim refugees taught to lie about being Christian by NGOs.
[02:50:01.871 --> 02:50:06.296]  Surprise, surprise, the UN is lying and organizing criminal activity.
[02:50:07.708 --> 02:50:08.468]  We're going to go to everybody.
[02:50:09.749 --> 02:50:13.391]  Let's go to... Who was I going to go to first?
[02:50:16.512 --> 02:50:19.513]  I guess we're going to go to George in Connecticut.
[02:50:19.533 --> 02:50:20.494]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:50:22.355 --> 02:50:23.535]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:50:23.555 --> 02:50:37.219]  The weekend before the election, I saw, unfortunately, I flip around a lot, so I wasn't sure on which network or where, but they saw the Chinese ambassador basically being interviewed, and he made no bones about it.
[02:50:37.239 --> 02:50:42.200]  They spent hundreds of millions of dollars in trying to influence the political scene in America.
[02:50:42.740 --> 02:50:47.542]  And I'm sure it's more like a billion dollars, but you know, you know that they underestimate this.
[02:50:47.802 --> 02:50:53.485]  Unfortunately, I couldn't tell if it was the UN ambassador or the ambassador of the United States.
[02:50:53.985 --> 02:50:55.365]  I think that's an important issue.
[02:50:56.146 --> 02:50:58.026]  There's a second issue, but I'll let you comment on that.
[02:50:58.046 --> 02:50:59.267]  There's a second issue I want to bring up.
[02:51:01.628 --> 02:51:03.949]  State that again, because your phone was breaking up during one part.
[02:51:04.927 --> 02:51:21.021]  I said the Chinese ambassador just before the election was being interviewed on one of the major networks and he made no bones about it that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars in trying to influence... Oh yes, I saw that.
[02:51:21.161 --> 02:51:21.722]  I saw that.
[02:51:21.902 --> 02:51:22.983]  And they don't even hide it.
[02:51:23.043 --> 02:51:25.785]  And then the same... It was the ambassador to the UN.
[02:51:26.086 --> 02:51:27.627]  And they also basically said that at the UN.
[02:51:27.647 --> 02:51:28.328]  He said, big deal.
[02:51:29.248 --> 02:51:34.134]  This is open and shut collusion, and then there's none with the Russians.
[02:51:34.154 --> 02:51:36.817]  The Republicans can destroy the Democrats.
[02:51:37.398 --> 02:51:39.901]  And they keep trying to take the quote, high road.
[02:51:40.181 --> 02:51:42.504]  No, that's taking the low road and letting them commit these crimes.
[02:51:43.545 --> 02:51:45.167]  I saw the articles where he admitted that.
[02:51:45.768 --> 02:51:47.370]  What channel was he on, George, when you saw that?
[02:51:48.351 --> 02:51:49.893]  I wasn't absolutely sure.
[02:51:49.913 --> 02:51:52.917]  It may have been an NBC, but I can't be absolutely sure.
[02:51:53.217 --> 02:51:56.281]  I flip around a lot, so that's why I made my job.
[02:51:56.301 --> 02:51:57.082]  No, sir, I know.
[02:51:57.202 --> 02:52:00.146]  It's totally insane, and I appreciate your call.
[02:52:00.166 --> 02:52:00.707]  What was the other point?
[02:52:01.465 --> 02:52:09.247]  The other point is, I think one of the things that I think should be made an issue of, all this nonsense with refugees, children, etc.
[02:52:09.267 --> 02:52:09.668]  etc.
[02:52:09.688 --> 02:52:22.732]  I was out in Long Island and stuff in Scandinavia, I don't have to tell you what's going on there with the so-called dreamers who basically became MS-13, but the real point I'm getting at is that every one of these people are put on Social Security.
[02:52:22.752 --> 02:52:25.252]  They're basically destroying the Social Security system.
[02:52:25.733 --> 02:52:27.133]  Everyone that's on Social Security...
[02:52:27.193 --> 02:52:33.717]  Absolutely, that's why socialists now all over Europe are joining with the right wing saying no more because now they learned document cam shot.
[02:52:33.797 --> 02:52:34.698]  I appreciate your call, George.
[02:52:35.138 --> 02:52:40.781]  I was about to flash back to this article in July 2016 when they'd taken down Ukraine.
[02:52:40.861 --> 02:52:42.502]  I talked about it months before they even said it.
[02:52:43.683 --> 02:52:48.786]  Soros plots a European order coup, EU will disintegrate, rise again under new Marshall Plan.
[02:52:49.006 --> 02:52:50.267]  That's always been the plan.
[02:52:50.687 --> 02:52:53.409]  Build it up, plunge it, bankrupt the countries.
[02:52:54.304 --> 02:52:54.684]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:52:54.704 --> 02:52:55.165]  I agree with you.
[02:52:55.205 --> 02:52:56.045]  I think it's time to focus.
[02:52:56.065 --> 02:52:56.626]  Take name and number.
[02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:21.495]  And to start identifying the dimensions which are weakening the United States so greatly.
[02:53:22.335 --> 02:53:30.922]  The globalists have been able to monetize themselves over the years to the point now that they've got trillions of dollars.
[02:53:31.382 --> 02:53:32.683]  Everyone's in debt to who?
[02:53:33.064 --> 02:53:35.406]  I mean, you know, look, trillion here, a trillion there.
[02:53:35.766 --> 02:53:37.107]  Pretty soon you're talking real money.
[02:53:37.688 --> 02:53:44.873]  And in the context of what the President of the United States has a responsibility to do is to stop them monetizing these people.
[02:53:45.274 --> 02:53:50.398]  Take the Treasury and restore it to the United States of America.
[02:53:51.979 --> 02:53:54.841]  The money printing... Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:53:55.181 --> 02:53:58.484]  Trump has pointed out the private run for private Federal Reserve is sabotaging the recovery.
[02:53:59.512 --> 02:54:06.055]  And he needs to exercise power over it and not be bamboozled that it's this separate thing that's above the law.
[02:54:06.355 --> 02:54:08.695]  No branch of government's above the law and it's not even in the government.
[02:54:09.576 --> 02:54:11.036]  So we need to go after that.
[02:54:11.096 --> 02:54:13.837]  We have to absolutely go after all the foreign meddling.
[02:54:13.877 --> 02:54:14.878]  We have to go on the offense.
[02:54:15.198 --> 02:54:22.521]  Can you believe the Democrats have announced hearings they're going to have into Trump's attacks on the free press when it's the Democrats and the deep state
[02:54:23.701 --> 02:54:31.066]  Openly trying to destroy free speech and free press in this country, and it was Obama that persecuted a living snot out of hundreds of reporters he had arrested?
[02:54:32.166 --> 02:54:33.667]  Alex, but it isn't that.
[02:54:33.707 --> 02:54:35.708]  You see, that's reacting to them.
[02:54:35.968 --> 02:54:39.571]  It's like, you know, remember in school, when somebody said, oh, but you're ugly.
[02:54:39.691 --> 02:54:40.491]  Oh, no, I'm not ugly.
[02:54:40.551 --> 02:54:41.852]  I once was a wee beauty queen.
[02:54:42.112 --> 02:54:44.133]  Oh, no, but your father... No, no, I agree.
[02:54:44.233 --> 02:54:45.294]  We need to get out of the U.N.
[02:54:45.314 --> 02:54:49.857]  and stop funding them to stop the migrant waves that are running, and we need to have Trump take over the Federal Reserve.
[02:54:50.754 --> 02:54:55.778]  We have to stop them controlling the agenda, and now we're defending all the time.
[02:54:56.359 --> 02:55:00.942]  It's about time that we actually start showing the real non-doctor videos.
[02:55:01.703 --> 02:55:12.572]  The videos, for instance, like the one that, you know, Joan Rivers once made, and you showed so clearly that the video wasn't doctor, neither was Michelle Obama, okay?
[02:55:12.812 --> 02:55:16.635]  No, the point is that it's at the level that people will begin to see.
[02:55:16.655 --> 02:55:20.038]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that women don't have shoulders like that.
[02:55:21.074 --> 02:55:22.395]  It's not that, Alex.
[02:55:22.455 --> 02:55:25.976]  It's the fact that you're always reacting to an attack.
[02:55:26.677 --> 02:55:31.779]  And the whole point is to keep you on one foot, instead of covering the real... Well, let me explain something.
[02:55:31.839 --> 02:55:33.260]  If Paul wouldn't have responded...
[02:55:34.224 --> 02:55:35.865]  Because I've gone with that tactic you just said.
[02:55:36.345 --> 02:55:42.448]  If Paul Wooden responded to them saying that was fake, and had forensic experts come out and say no, it wasn't fake, they were planning to take him off.
[02:55:43.348 --> 02:55:44.208]  And they're gonna do it anyways.
[02:55:44.669 --> 02:55:45.329]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:55:45.629 --> 02:55:46.389]  I understand, sir.
[02:55:46.690 --> 02:55:51.432]  But at the same time, to your audience, you have to address things that aren't true or they'll believe it.
[02:55:51.832 --> 02:55:54.653]  So I have to tell the audience when they come out and say this stuff that we didn't do it.
[02:55:55.794 --> 02:56:00.796]  Yes, but if a corporation, for instance, a media conglomerate,
[02:56:01.224 --> 02:56:03.586]  It's not serving the best interest of the American people.
[02:56:04.086 --> 02:56:04.367]  All right?
[02:56:04.647 --> 02:56:05.487]  They have a charter.
[02:56:05.868 --> 02:56:07.049]  Listen, I hear you.
[02:56:07.689 --> 02:56:08.650]  CNN is cancer.
[02:56:08.890 --> 02:56:10.451]  They're all trying to shut down the free press.
[02:56:10.511 --> 02:56:11.132]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:11.952 --> 02:56:13.694]  They're openly at war with the president.
[02:56:13.834 --> 02:56:14.814]  This nation is at war.
[02:56:14.875 --> 02:56:16.055]  They are enemies of the people.
[02:56:16.576 --> 02:56:17.537]  And Trump has identified it.
[02:56:18.377 --> 02:56:20.578]  And it's just getting worse and worse and worse.
[02:56:20.838 --> 02:56:21.339]  And here's the deal.
[02:56:21.439 --> 02:56:22.459]  I don't want to shut them down.
[02:56:22.779 --> 02:56:24.060]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:29.383]  So when someone makes the move to overthrow your country, they're no longer under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:56:29.803 --> 02:56:31.063]  It's whoever makes the first move.
[02:56:31.163 --> 02:56:32.564]  I totally hear what you're saying.
[02:56:32.824 --> 02:56:34.085]  We are dealing with criminals.
[02:56:34.145 --> 02:56:36.706]  We are dealing with organized foreign powers.
[02:56:37.566 --> 02:56:42.709]  And the President knows that, but he's afraid to tank the stock market if he gets too aggressive.
[02:56:42.729 --> 02:56:44.490]  Because people can't handle the truth, man.
[02:56:45.930 --> 02:56:47.011]  We're going to come back, take more calls.
[02:56:47.051 --> 02:56:49.332]  Mike Adams is coming up with a lot of stunning information as well.
[02:56:50.253 --> 02:56:52.574]  Please don't forget, without you funding us, we're not here.
[02:56:52.654 --> 02:56:54.275]  Thank you for all the support over the years.
[02:56:55.076 --> 02:56:57.637]  We had that big, huge mega sale, 50% off storewide.
[02:56:58.117 --> 02:57:06.542]  We now have 67 to 49% off on select bestsellers, like Colloidal Silver, Silver Bullet, 60, 67% off.
[02:57:07.183 --> 02:57:11.345]  We've got Super Mill Vitality, last run, even though it's a bestseller, it's too expensive and too hard to make, 57% off.
[02:57:11.365 --> 02:57:11.726]  It's amazing.
[02:57:14.636 --> 02:57:19.818]  Folks, I could have put out the original X2, but they were gouging us.
[02:57:19.938 --> 02:57:21.699]  I went and got even better Deep Earth Crystals.
[02:57:22.659 --> 02:57:25.220]  In fact, I'm going to explain this when we come back.
[02:57:25.441 --> 02:57:26.981]  X3 is superior.
[02:57:27.681 --> 02:57:29.562]  I'm going to break something down about X3 as well.
[02:57:29.642 --> 02:57:32.403]  It's 50% off and free shipping at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:57:32.623 --> 02:57:36.105]  Oh, I forgot, the free shipping is still store-wide at InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:57:36.125 --> 02:57:39.746]  Get a t-shirt, get a water filtration system, get some books, get some videos.
[02:57:40.287 --> 02:57:40.787]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:45.811 --> 02:57:46.491]  Three words.
[02:57:47.532 --> 02:57:49.213]  Energized quantum state.
[02:57:50.754 --> 02:57:51.274]  Two words.
[02:57:52.915 --> 02:57:53.415]  X3.
[02:57:54.496 --> 02:57:58.819]  You've seen how the entire global power structure is desperate to shut us down.
[02:57:59.339 --> 02:58:00.159]  And it's for good reasons.
[02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:02.181]  We've done our research.
[02:58:02.521 --> 02:58:04.262]  We've seen how they're targeting the people.
[02:58:05.453 --> 02:58:07.074]  And how they're trying to suppress the population.
[02:58:07.234 --> 02:58:09.775]  And one of their biggest attacks is fluoridation of water.
[02:58:10.215 --> 02:58:11.216]  The bad halogen.
[02:58:11.236 --> 02:58:14.417]  There's a bunch of bad halogens, but fluoride is chief amongst them.
[02:58:14.437 --> 02:58:17.359]  And then they electrify it into an acid base.
[02:58:18.359 --> 02:58:19.860]  So it's hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:58:21.272 --> 02:58:33.636]  Survival Shield X3 is the latest in the X family and has all three types of iodine from thousands of feet deep under the earth so it's not radioactive or be contaminated by modern chemicals.
[02:58:34.216 --> 02:58:38.558]  And it's got a tiny amount of vitamin C that stabilizes it and stops it from being oxidized.
[02:58:38.598 --> 02:58:38.838]  Folks,
[02:58:40.777 --> 02:58:43.439]  Everything we do makes the Globals pull their hair out for a reason.
[02:58:43.659 --> 02:58:46.701]  Because, again, we study how they're attacking, what they're obsessed with.
[02:58:46.881 --> 02:58:49.262]  They are completely into iodine.
[02:58:49.642 --> 02:58:51.643]  They've even tried to buy us out and get us to stop doing this.
[02:58:52.964 --> 02:58:56.346]  And most of the forms of iodine are bound, and so you're not absorbing.
[02:58:56.366 --> 02:58:58.467]  X1, X2 are great.
[02:59:00.109 --> 02:59:01.571]  X3 is the next level.
[02:59:01.591 --> 02:59:05.334]  It has the Deep Earth Crystals, the other two types, and a little bit of Vitamin C to energize it.
[02:59:05.735 --> 02:59:09.298]  It's available in 2-ounce and 1-ounce at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:09.478 --> 02:59:16.565]  And from the very start, 50% off and free shipping because I want you to get it, and I want you to take it, and I want you to see what it does.
[02:59:17.286 --> 02:59:20.209]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:59:20.969 --> 02:59:21.410]  X3.
[02:59:21.890 --> 02:59:22.971]  Now again, it's an element.
[02:59:23.131 --> 02:59:24.472]  Takes a few weeks to kick in.
[02:59:24.492 --> 02:59:27.775]  A lot of people detoxify about three weeks in.
[02:59:27.815 --> 02:59:28.556]  So be ready for that.
[02:59:28.596 --> 02:59:29.357]  Consult your physician.
[02:59:30.077 --> 02:59:34.621]  Start your journey today at InfoWarsLife.com with our newest product that I'm the most excited about ever.
[02:59:35.242 --> 02:59:35.882]  X3.
[02:59:36.323 --> 02:59:40.246]  Just like our info changes the world, this changes your body and your life.
[02:59:41.407 --> 02:59:41.767]  X3.
[02:59:41.807 --> 02:59:42.508]  You can't lose.
[02:59:42.668 --> 02:59:44.530]  It helps fund the info war and it's great for you.
[02:59:49.923 --> 02:59:51.708]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:52.070 --> 02:59:53.554]  You are the Resistance.
[03:00:24.235 --> 03:00:26.778]  All right, Mike Adams is coming up at 15 after the host.
[03:00:27.839 --> 03:00:30.001]  Three segments of the broadcast, always informative.
[03:00:30.041 --> 03:00:34.706]  Look forward to that in the War Room 3 to 6 with Owen Schroer, Roger Stone and others.
[03:00:35.186 --> 03:00:39.470]  We're going to take a few more calls from Matt and others here in just a moment, but first off, I want to explain something.
[03:00:41.252 --> 03:00:42.433]  We've gotten a lot of phone calls.
[03:00:43.416 --> 03:00:48.539]  I've seen some comments, even though it's gotten five-star reviews at InfoWareStore.com, that people are confused.
[03:00:48.559 --> 03:00:54.182]  They're like, X3 shows a little bit less iodine on the back than X2.
[03:00:55.283 --> 03:00:59.886]  Well, that's because the latest statements by the FDA is they think it should be lower.
[03:01:00.306 --> 03:01:02.267]  And they're going to lower stuff down to zero soon.
[03:01:02.888 --> 03:01:06.450]  But just to play ball with all the baloney, we have a
[03:01:08.374 --> 03:01:10.258]  Lower dose that you're supposed to take.
[03:01:10.679 --> 03:01:15.609]  Whatever you think or whatever your physician thinks is best for you, you do that, you judge it, okay?
[03:01:17.172 --> 03:01:17.412]  Also...
[03:01:18.396 --> 03:01:22.678]  We used to put out a seaweed base that was very, very clean, but not very strong.
[03:01:23.598 --> 03:01:27.920]  And then we found a deep-earth crystal source that was so amazing and had that for five years.
[03:01:27.940 --> 03:01:30.241]  And then I got kind of put over a barrel getting it.
[03:01:30.281 --> 03:01:31.001]  It cost too much.
[03:01:31.081 --> 03:01:42.906]  So we went out and found another pharmaceutical-level institution, manufacturer, that had the DEA letters and all the stuff to get it to where they could get the very same or even stronger deep-earth crystals.
[03:01:44.189 --> 03:01:50.673]  But then it was explained to me by chemists and others that a very small percentage of people can't absorb pure atomic iodine, even though it's the best type.
[03:01:51.133 --> 03:01:54.095]  So there's a little bit of the other two types of iodine in there.
[03:01:55.576 --> 03:01:59.838]  So I could easily call it X3 when you reformulate and have it be the exact same formula.
[03:02:00.218 --> 03:02:04.361]  This is a new formula because we believe it is the best.
[03:02:05.321 --> 03:02:07.262]  That's what we've done with X3.
[03:02:09.338 --> 03:02:12.860]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, it's extremely pure.
[03:02:13.080 --> 03:02:15.921]  All three types of iodine that are in it are extremely pure.
[03:02:16.421 --> 03:02:23.284]  It has the atomic iodine, it has the other two types of iodine in it, and it has a tiny bit of vitamin C that keeps it from oxidizing.
[03:02:24.225 --> 03:02:26.486]  It would be black if it didn't have that in there.
[03:02:26.506 --> 03:02:27.526]  It's so pure and so strong.
[03:02:27.546 --> 03:02:29.027]  Because that's the oxidization.
[03:02:29.087 --> 03:02:31.488]  Instead, it's like this beautiful orange
[03:02:32.611 --> 03:02:41.334]  glowing color that turns blue on paper, which is the atomic color of iodine, kind of a blue purplish crystal color.
[03:02:41.734 --> 03:02:48.116]  So Survival Shield X3 is, from our research, the very best iodine you can get.
[03:02:49.522 --> 03:02:52.505]  I've seen some people say, well it doesn't matter, I want the original X2.
[03:02:52.645 --> 03:02:53.125]  You know what?
[03:02:53.806 --> 03:02:58.650]  I can reformulate and call it X2 if you want that and not have the other two iodides and just have two different types, whatever you want.
[03:02:59.091 --> 03:03:03.315]  But this isn't us unable to get the deep earth crystals we're able to now.
[03:03:03.835 --> 03:03:04.596]  We have a contract.
[03:03:04.876 --> 03:03:09.841]  It's that it's better from our research to have all three types.
[03:03:10.742 --> 03:03:10.962]  X3 is 50% off.
[03:03:13.609 --> 03:03:17.533]  For only, but this sale's only going for another five, six days.
[03:03:18.094 --> 03:03:24.281]  So you can get your X3 50% off and with free shipping at m4store.com or m4slime.com.
[03:03:24.381 --> 03:03:28.085]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, you can get X2 still.
[03:03:29.026 --> 03:03:30.468]  Our last big order of it's huge.
[03:03:30.868 --> 03:03:32.310]  It'll probably be a long time till we can get more.
[03:03:32.330 --> 03:03:33.591]  I have to put a new order in and it takes time.
[03:03:34.380 --> 03:03:38.504]  But if people want X2, we'll remanufacture X2 for you all day long.
[03:03:39.004 --> 03:03:40.966]  X3 is better, in my view.
[03:03:41.206 --> 03:03:47.412]  But different strokes for different folks, and I forget to take my daily dose every day, a lot of times, and then I really feel it later.
[03:03:47.832 --> 03:03:50.254]  Stamina, libido, energy, it really is magic.
[03:03:50.695 --> 03:03:54.999]  And that's why there's this whole iodine conspiracy of giving you bad halogens, not the good halogen.
[03:03:55.299 --> 03:03:57.020]  Mike Adams is coming up in about 10 minutes.
[03:03:57.341 --> 03:03:59.022]  Mike, I know you're loaded for bear, my friend.
[03:03:59.042 --> 03:03:59.783]  What are you going to be covering?
[03:04:00.700 --> 03:04:16.933]  Well, when you opened the show this morning and you talked about how we need to have a bigger picture point of view, I'm going to be covering that because the election fraud and the criminal fraud of the Democrats and the deception is really just a symptom of assaults on consciousness and assaults on humanity.
[03:04:16.973 --> 03:04:22.958]  So that's going to cover that in a much bigger point of view, some of the things you mentioned, but also expanding it to other areas.
[03:04:22.998 --> 03:04:24.199]  I've got a lot coming up.
[03:04:25.279 --> 03:04:36.363]  But I think all of us at an instinctive and spiritual level get Trump's great, nationalism's great, but this battle, this war is so out of control, we have to change people fundamentally at the consciousness level.
[03:04:37.263 --> 03:04:38.203]  Well, exactly.
[03:04:38.223 --> 03:04:45.005]  There are many people who are Trump supporters, but they're still destroying their minds and their bodies with 5G radiation or fluoride poisoning.
[03:04:45.485 --> 03:04:50.527]  We really have to be healthier and more conscious and aware if we're going to win this battle at every level.
[03:04:50.567 --> 03:04:51.707]  So that's true.
[03:04:52.027 --> 03:04:54.268]  Well, naturalnews.com's Mike Adams.
[03:04:57.492 --> 03:04:58.653]  We've changed the world with your help.
[03:04:58.953 --> 03:05:00.214]  You've changed the world through us.
[03:05:00.234 --> 03:05:01.195]  We've changed it through you.
[03:05:01.215 --> 03:05:02.956]  I'm in your hands.
[03:05:03.076 --> 03:05:04.217]  Infowars is in your hands.
[03:05:04.277 --> 03:05:05.098]  The world's in your hands.
[03:05:05.458 --> 03:05:07.639]  I've got really great products that everybody needs anyways.
[03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:08.840]  But we need your funding.
[03:05:08.960 --> 03:05:12.643]  We need money to do this and to continue to fight and hopefully expand.
[03:05:12.683 --> 03:05:14.364]  Because if you don't expand, you can trap.
[03:05:14.605 --> 03:05:15.525]  There is no middle ground.
[03:05:15.685 --> 03:05:17.667]  I need everybody today to realize how real all this is.
[03:05:18.087 --> 03:05:21.048]  I told you about the anti-fidoxy and going to the houses is the prelude.
[03:05:21.228 --> 03:05:23.089]  Ivan said they'll probably do it first with Tucker Carlson.
[03:05:23.129 --> 03:05:24.290]  I don't know how I know all this stuff.
[03:05:24.310 --> 03:05:26.351]  The point is, is that I need everybody to go.
[03:05:26.511 --> 03:05:28.031]  I really need a water filtering system.
[03:05:28.151 --> 03:05:32.613]  And Alex Jones sells the highest rated ones out there, and they're 49% off right now.
[03:05:32.753 --> 03:05:35.034]  I'm gonna get Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system.
[03:05:35.054 --> 03:05:37.735]  Or I'm gonna get X2, which is selling out.
[03:05:37.795 --> 03:05:38.436]  We have the new X3.
[03:05:38.476 --> 03:05:40.116]  People go, wait, X3 was a little bit weaker.
[03:05:40.236 --> 03:05:41.857]  Well, yeah, because it's got three types of iodine.
[03:05:41.957 --> 03:05:43.898]  So there's less of one and then more of the other two.
[03:05:44.178 --> 03:05:45.418]  It's cheaper to put one type in there.
[03:05:45.498 --> 03:05:47.059]  It's better to put all three in.
[03:05:47.439 --> 03:05:48.219]  Tri-iodine.
[03:05:48.239 --> 03:05:48.520]  So X3.
[03:05:48.840 --> 03:05:50.080]  50% off as well.
[03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:51.001]  Free shipping storewide.
[03:05:51.101 --> 03:05:52.021]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:52.041 --> 03:05:53.281]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:05:53.322 --> 03:05:53.942]  So please support us.
[03:05:54.002 --> 03:05:54.262]  Thank you.
[03:05:58.121 --> 03:06:10.211]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[03:06:10.711 --> 03:06:12.172]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.993 --> 03:06:14.814]  Okay, Mike Adams is coming up in 10 minutes.
[03:06:14.874 --> 03:06:15.754]  I was just about to go to Matt.
[03:06:15.774 --> 03:06:16.374]  He just hung up.
[03:06:16.394 --> 03:06:21.896]  We're going to go to Brad and Judy and Jerome and Jesse and a few others here right now.
[03:06:22.536 --> 03:06:24.397]  Brad in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding.
[03:06:24.417 --> 03:06:25.337]  You're on the air.
[03:06:25.938 --> 03:06:27.218]  What do you make of this election?
[03:06:27.238 --> 03:06:29.039]  They're openly stealing Florida.
[03:06:29.059 --> 03:06:33.140]  It looks like they're going to steal that whole situation in Arizona.
[03:06:33.220 --> 03:06:34.100]  It's so transparent.
[03:06:34.861 --> 03:06:35.561]  This is insane.
[03:06:36.334 --> 03:06:37.575]  It's unbelievable, Alex.
[03:06:37.635 --> 03:06:39.117]  It continues to happen.
[03:06:40.258 --> 03:06:42.720]  Our election system is an absolute joke.
[03:06:42.760 --> 03:06:44.702]  I don't know how anybody can say it isn't.
[03:06:45.963 --> 03:06:49.166]  I don't know what the solution is, but it's completely off the chain.
[03:06:49.186 --> 03:06:50.047]  It's ridiculous.
[03:06:51.028 --> 03:06:53.050]  I know Trump's on top of Florida.
[03:06:53.710 --> 03:06:58.833]  It's probably, it may be too little too late, and the stuff that was captured on video is awesome.
[03:06:59.093 --> 03:07:02.515]  Whoever caught that stuff to document it, thank God for that.
[03:07:02.555 --> 03:07:09.619]  And of course it's a famous county that's been convicted of doing this over and over again, and Trump can't do everything.
[03:07:09.659 --> 03:07:11.440]  He's under attack from every angle.
[03:07:11.460 --> 03:07:12.221]  It's just insane.
[03:07:13.221 --> 03:07:14.102]  And he's all by himself.
[03:07:14.162 --> 03:07:16.043]  No one steps up to help him.
[03:07:16.183 --> 03:07:17.464]  I feel so sorry for that guy.
[03:07:18.184 --> 03:07:20.606]  And it's because men in this country, more than anybody,
[03:07:21.599 --> 03:07:29.624]  Think going along with the system gets them ahead, and so no one will stick their neck out until we all lose our necks because of the incredible cowardice.
[03:07:31.025 --> 03:07:40.131]  And the media and the newspapers, the television media, I mean, they're just demonizing anything, everyone from all different sides, including Trump.
[03:07:40.171 --> 03:07:42.492]  You guys, you guys do an excellent job.
[03:07:42.552 --> 03:07:45.034]  I said this to Owen the other night after you left.
[03:07:45.534 --> 03:07:48.116]  You guys deserve a Pulitzer Prize, and all they do is just
[03:07:50.158 --> 03:07:54.582]  Absolutely.
[03:07:55.062 --> 03:07:59.266]  Well, it's a badge of honor because these people really are globalist enemies that have taken the country over.
[03:07:59.466 --> 03:08:00.307]  It's true what Trump says.
[03:08:00.327 --> 03:08:02.148]  He says, I don't want to say this, but it's true.
[03:08:02.229 --> 03:08:02.709]  I have to.
[03:08:03.049 --> 03:08:04.691]  These are literally enemies.
[03:08:05.131 --> 03:08:07.312]  That doesn't mean we go attack them like Antifa does us.
[03:08:07.352 --> 03:08:15.073]  It means they really hate the country, they hate nationalism, they hate us existing because they work for a bunch of ruthless global corporations that are tax-exempt.
[03:08:15.393 --> 03:08:17.974]  These people do not have any moral authority.
[03:08:18.014 --> 03:08:18.794]  They are frauds.
[03:08:19.094 --> 03:08:19.875]  God bless you, Brad.
[03:08:20.235 --> 03:08:20.735]  Great points.
[03:08:20.835 --> 03:08:23.755]  Jesse, in my home state of Texas.
[03:08:24.696 --> 03:08:25.176]  You're on the air.
[03:08:25.196 --> 03:08:25.656]  Thanks for holding.
[03:08:27.196 --> 03:08:29.197]  Hey, thank you so much for having me on, Alex.
[03:08:29.217 --> 03:08:29.657]  Thanks, brother.
[03:08:29.677 --> 03:08:29.857]  Go ahead.
[03:08:31.685 --> 03:08:36.588]  Well, I had a couple of Bible passages on the very serious subject of life extension.
[03:08:37.469 --> 03:08:41.411]  I saw that you were sort of struggling with it, and I just wanted to give Christian support.
[03:08:42.412 --> 03:08:58.361]  I think two passages that are relevant in Matthew, when he therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken by Daniel the prophet stand in the holy place, some people take that
[03:08:59.016 --> 03:09:01.859]  To mean androids or clones?
[03:09:02.179 --> 03:09:04.381]  I think that's a really interesting interpretation.
[03:09:06.883 --> 03:09:17.972]  I mean, I remember hearing different pastors say when they talk about the image of the beast will be seen worldwide and will be, you know, huge, but it'll be, you know, like a man, but not.
[03:09:18.573 --> 03:09:26.540]  I think that will be these AI avatars that people are then made to worship, which the globalists say that will be the new global God.
[03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:33.344]  Well, avatar is a really interesting word, because they keep throwing that in our face all the time.
[03:09:33.384 --> 03:09:39.290]  With movies, you could project, like, a video game into an avatar and move it around.
[03:09:39.310 --> 03:09:40.431]  Yeah, it's demon possession.
[03:09:40.451 --> 03:09:41.451]  They're telling you what they're doing.
[03:09:42.592 --> 03:09:42.893]  Yeah.
[03:09:43.573 --> 03:09:49.338]  Well, the other passage, and I just want to support you today with what you were doing, because I saw it was a very serious subject.
[03:09:50.579 --> 03:09:55.964]  In Revelation 9, 6, and in those days shall men seek death.
[03:09:56.816 --> 03:10:04.828]  Well yeah, doesn't it say they'll sit under the mountains and caves and beat themselves on the head, wishing God would let them die, but God won't?
[03:10:14.085 --> 03:10:14.866]  That's Revelation 6.
[03:10:15.347 --> 03:10:18.530]  You kind of have to skip, but that's, I think, how Revelation is structured.
[03:10:18.810 --> 03:10:21.293]  I love this passage because it gives me so much faith.
[03:10:21.633 --> 03:10:23.015]  And you know they've got it lined up.
[03:10:23.856 --> 03:10:27.320]  And the king... And notice, notice, notice, the globalists are in their bunkers.
[03:10:28.421 --> 03:10:28.681]  Yeah.
[03:10:28.761 --> 03:10:29.923]  Wishing they could die.
[03:10:31.745 --> 03:10:31.985]  Right.
[03:10:32.560 --> 03:10:36.243]  Well, who knows what kind of manipulation and extortion they have.
[03:10:36.704 --> 03:10:51.417]  And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains.
[03:10:51.917 --> 03:10:53.699]  I get so much comfort from that.
[03:10:54.582 --> 03:11:03.507]  When you and Donald Trump are out there and you're running interference for the rest of us and you're fighting the good fight, I want to say bless you, Alex Jones.
[03:11:03.547 --> 03:11:04.448]  I pray for you.
[03:11:04.968 --> 03:11:08.690]  Strength and encouragement sends you peace and courage.
[03:11:09.470 --> 03:11:10.451]  I love what you're doing.
[03:11:11.576 --> 03:11:16.259]  My one criticism today is right now there are bombs on the Gaza Strip.
[03:11:16.319 --> 03:11:37.974]  I'd love to hear coverage of that, but when I see that heaviness of this subject of life extension, you've been out there since Community Access talking about clones and androids, and I just want Christians to pray for you, because this is why they're coming after you, I think, is the deep, dark secrets, the disclosure of the deep underground military bases
[03:11:38.963 --> 03:11:42.644]  I actually live in Knoxville, Tennessee, but I went to college in Austin.
[03:11:43.064 --> 03:11:44.484]  I love what you're doing, sir.
[03:11:44.825 --> 03:11:47.305]  God bless you for the kind words, Jesse.
[03:11:47.345 --> 03:11:49.846]  And let's remember, the military is some of our best people.
[03:11:49.866 --> 03:11:52.587]  That's why they want to replace them with robots at the Globalist Command.
[03:11:53.027 --> 03:11:54.847]  Most of these bases are under UN.
[03:11:55.587 --> 03:11:57.568]  They're under NASA.
[03:11:58.368 --> 03:12:00.429]  They're under shadow government operations.
[03:12:00.809 --> 03:12:03.250]  The military isn't even involved in a lot of them.
[03:12:04.251 --> 03:12:09.273]  So when you hear deep underground military bases, it's all the DARPA breakaway civilization.
[03:12:09.673 --> 03:12:13.975]  And that's why our military has to understand in the final phases, they're supposed to be cut off.
[03:12:15.316 --> 03:12:21.100]  They're supposed to be given bad vaccines, they're supposed to be treated like absolute crap, and then basically phased out.
[03:12:21.140 --> 03:12:23.402]  That's why they're putting transgenders in the military.
[03:12:23.562 --> 03:12:34.310]  All of this is to kill readiness, sabotage the military ahead of the machine rollout, which is way more advanced than the establishment is telling the public.
[03:12:34.330 --> 03:12:34.871]  Thank you, Jesse.
[03:12:35.371 --> 03:12:38.013]  Real fast, Judy in Florida, thanks for calling.
[03:12:38.293 --> 03:12:39.194]  Go ahead, Judy, welcome.
[03:12:41.007 --> 03:13:01.757]  Hey Alex, just in following up what you've been saying today about what, you know, prophecy has been being fulfilled, and speaking about the RFID chip, for like newbies or people that just really don't know what prophecy you're talking about, I mean, it goes direct to Scripture, and I know you've talked about John on the Isle of Patmos and his direct
[03:13:02.612 --> 03:13:02.873]  I don't
[03:13:21.812 --> 03:13:26.733]  Say that he had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
[03:13:27.114 --> 03:13:28.354]  And he is Satan.
[03:13:28.754 --> 03:13:31.815]  And, you know, I don't want you to just start preaching on air.
[03:13:32.195 --> 03:13:36.456]  I love how you reveal Jesus in your words and deeds already.
[03:13:36.676 --> 03:13:39.737]  You're not meant to just, you know, do raw preaching.
[03:13:40.397 --> 03:13:47.960]  Whether it's the Book of Revelations, which we're living in, which I believe we are, but be that as it may, we're supposed to move forward as
[03:13:49.813 --> 03:13:52.614]  The image of God in his creation.
[03:13:53.094 --> 03:13:56.394]  And that's what, you know, I'm in 100% agreement with you.
[03:13:56.494 --> 03:14:01.435]  Well, man, the reason I, I mean, I'd be more than happy to, you know, sit up here and just be a classic preacher.
[03:14:01.475 --> 03:14:03.556]  Just those guys are all kind of shuttered.
[03:14:03.596 --> 03:14:04.676]  They don't see what's happening.
[03:14:05.016 --> 03:14:06.716]  They don't tell people to go out and confront it.
[03:14:07.737 --> 03:14:12.618]  And I just simply tell atheists, anybody, whether you believe in this or not, this is classical authoritarianism.
[03:14:12.798 --> 03:14:14.158]  It's manifesting now.
[03:14:15.078 --> 03:14:19.039]  And we know where this goes, and people really should be aware.
[03:14:19.099 --> 03:14:20.779]  They really should be concerned.
[03:14:20.819 --> 03:14:21.319]  Thank you, Judy.
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:23.900]  Now, Mike Adams is all lined up, ready to go.
[03:14:23.920 --> 03:14:27.861]  I apologize to other callers, but we can take like 20 calls, so I got to a lot of them today.
[03:14:28.461 --> 03:14:30.141]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m.
[03:14:30.161 --> 03:14:30.481]  Central.
[03:14:30.521 --> 03:14:32.362]  David Knight will be back at 8 a.m.
[03:14:32.402 --> 03:14:32.762]  Central.
[03:14:33.722 --> 03:14:37.003]  Next three segments, he's loaded for bear, and the subjects he's going to cover
[03:14:38.092 --> 03:14:43.836]  It's really central that we can't just count on Trump and we just can't count on leaders to get us out of this.
[03:14:44.476 --> 03:14:47.077]  They're a manifestation of people awakening.
[03:14:47.178 --> 03:14:52.141]  We, all of us, have to really get out there and expose how evil these globalists are.
[03:14:52.301 --> 03:14:57.624]  Again, only because, I'm going to plug, plug, plug, because when I don't plug, we don't bring in the money, we need to operate.
[03:14:58.845 --> 03:15:00.626]  And gee, I sure don't want George Soros to win.
[03:15:00.666 --> 03:15:02.407]  It really just comes down to stuff that simple.
[03:15:03.527 --> 03:15:03.888]  We have.
[03:15:05.284 --> 03:15:07.185]  67% blowout sale on colloidal silver.
[03:15:07.205 --> 03:15:08.065]  That's a really good deal.
[03:15:08.165 --> 03:15:09.026]  Best deal ever on that.
[03:15:09.666 --> 03:15:13.007]  Super male, super female vitality is very hard to make.
[03:15:13.047 --> 03:15:13.748]  Takes a long time.
[03:15:13.788 --> 03:15:14.528]  It's cold pressed.
[03:15:15.909 --> 03:15:17.169]  And it's very expensive for me to get.
[03:15:17.229 --> 03:15:18.470]  It's one of our best selling products.
[03:15:18.550 --> 03:15:19.410]  I just can't deal with it.
[03:15:19.690 --> 03:15:28.434]  This is the last run and I'm just getting it out of the warehouse because I can't have a bunch of stuff in the warehouse in case they are able to take our payment processors, which they're doing around the clocks.
[03:15:28.454 --> 03:15:31.015]  We need to get a lot of orders in now while we still can.
[03:15:31.235 --> 03:15:32.976]  A plan for the worst, hope for the best.
[03:15:34.076 --> 03:15:37.757]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:37.777 --> 03:15:44.179]  But the Alexa Pure Pro, one of the very best gravity-fed filters out there, leading competitors that are similar, $300 plus.
[03:15:44.239 --> 03:15:45.679]  It's normally $240 something.
[03:15:46.019 --> 03:15:47.440]  It's $127 right now.
[03:15:47.800 --> 03:15:48.720]  The best deal you'll find.
[03:15:48.860 --> 03:15:49.480]  No excuses.
[03:15:49.560 --> 03:15:50.621]  Everyone should be filtering their water.
[03:15:51.121 --> 03:15:52.101]  It's at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:16:00.521 --> 03:16:10.112]  Paul, get into this huge situation in Europe because I know that the Islamicists are raping and stealing and killing and then the leftists say because you're not bringing enough Muslims in.
[03:16:10.232 --> 03:16:14.517]  It's like they're trying to flip reality into this bizarro deception land.
[03:16:14.677 --> 03:16:16.619]  So, what would you call this?
[03:16:16.899 --> 03:16:20.704]  Well, it's mass deception and going on to France, which you mentioned.
[03:16:21.424 --> 03:16:24.347]  Literally, there are like 8,000 Jews leaving Paris alone.
[03:16:24.387 --> 03:16:26.809]  I think it's Paris, maybe it's France, but I think it's Paris alone.
[03:16:26.970 --> 03:16:29.272]  Every single year, 8,000 Jews fleeing.
[03:16:29.852 --> 03:16:31.174]  We defend those people.
[03:16:31.214 --> 03:16:36.539]  We say this is horrible that anti-Semitic attacks are increasing in France, in all these European countries.
[03:16:36.899 --> 03:16:40.122]  And then we're called anti-Semites, Alex, in France.
[03:16:40.482 --> 03:16:43.185]  We've defended Jews being chased out of the country basically.
[03:16:43.265 --> 03:16:44.687]  Last night there were more riots.
[03:16:44.727 --> 03:16:45.928]  They called it the Purge.
[03:16:46.048 --> 03:16:51.154]  They based it on this movie which says the plot is you can commit any crime for one night.
[03:16:51.194 --> 03:16:52.435]  So they went on a rampage.
[03:16:52.655 --> 03:16:53.616]  Stores were looted.
[03:16:53.636 --> 03:16:54.837]  They had fights with police.
[03:16:54.998 --> 03:16:59.803]  In Paris as well this happened in Saint-Denis which is the area where they have... That's in Lyon that you're showing now.
[03:16:59.923 --> 03:17:02.926]  It was on the same night also in Saint-Denis Paris where they have
[03:17:03.907 --> 03:17:07.350]  400,000 illegal immigrants in this one area of Paris alone.
[03:17:07.671 --> 03:17:11.094]  They were throwing acid at the police, they were robbing grocery stores.
[03:17:11.655 --> 03:17:18.742]  And this came like the day after Francis Denintiri, Minister, he actually gave the interview back in February, but it was just published a few days ago.
[03:17:19.363 --> 03:17:28.615]  This is a Gerard Collomb who said basically they've got five years and after five years if they don't sort this out People aren't going to be living together.
[03:17:28.656 --> 03:17:33.222]  They're going to be facing They're going to be going face to face and he admits that it's all due to mass immigration.
[03:17:33.602 --> 03:17:34.524]  I went to Paris and
[03:17:35.356 --> 03:17:41.620]  About five times over the past ten years, Alex, you could tell the difference post-2015.
[03:17:42.081 --> 03:17:55.610]  After this new influx of migrants from the Middle East, it was literally... I would go to the hotel and drive past all these little shanty towns, all these tent cities where all the migrants were, thinking, oh, this must be the outer ghetto area of Paris.
[03:17:55.630 --> 03:17:58.452]  And it was like five minutes later, you've arrived at your destination.
[03:17:58.492 --> 03:18:00.013]  It was in the major tourist area.
[03:18:00.333 --> 03:18:04.256]  The mattresses on the streets, the Calais migrant camp wasn't really broken up.
[03:18:04.316 --> 03:18:07.858]  It just got dispersed out into all these major French cities.
[03:18:07.978 --> 03:18:09.819]  As you can see there, it's an absolute tip.
[03:18:09.899 --> 03:18:10.820]  It's an absolute dump.
[03:18:10.960 --> 03:18:17.004]  So they thought Macron was going to come in and do something because he raised the migrant, the Calais migrant camp.
[03:18:17.084 --> 03:18:22.868]  But then he later gave interviews where he said, no, we actually want to turn Europe into Eurabia.
[03:18:23.148 --> 03:18:25.189]  Let's be clear, people are fleeing literal societal collapse
[03:18:42.896 --> 03:18:44.678]  Real road warrior conditions.
[03:18:44.938 --> 03:18:48.861]  And then they don't want to get away from it to not be part of it.
[03:18:48.901 --> 03:18:54.466]  They want to bring it to you because they're usually the worst and the weakest of the nightmare system.
[03:18:54.686 --> 03:19:08.617]  So we're getting the worst of the worst of the worst chaperoned and captained by the left who believe this is some satanic ritual like defiling a baby or a virgin woman to defecate all over Europe and the U.S.
[03:19:08.877 --> 03:19:10.939]  and instead they're destroying their own wealth.
[03:19:11.059 --> 03:19:11.600]  The left is
[03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:13.241]  It is insane!
[03:19:13.581 --> 03:19:13.961]  Exactly.
[03:19:13.981 --> 03:19:21.125]  And then when you actually look at it, which I've done in all these major European countries, the few pocket areas of wealthy white areas, they've correlated it.
[03:19:21.165 --> 03:19:24.867]  That's where the most pro-immigration politicians and elitists live.
[03:19:24.947 --> 03:19:31.751]  So this is all being foisted on predominantly white working class people who live in these areas which are being ghettoized.
[03:19:31.891 --> 03:19:36.794]  And they're also the ones called racist by the elite, even though it's being foisted on them.
[03:19:37.154 --> 03:19:39.076]  The elite don't use public transport.
[03:19:39.096 --> 03:19:40.837]  They don't have to mingle with these people.
[03:19:41.177 --> 03:19:42.798]  They're chauffeured around everywhere.
[03:19:43.079 --> 03:19:49.823]  So again, they not only get the bad consequences of mass immigration, they also get blamed and called racist if they complain about it.
[03:19:59.711 --> 03:20:02.333]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.088 --> 03:20:13.211]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[03:20:13.671 --> 03:20:21.756]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:20:21.816 --> 03:20:23.897]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show fourth hour.
[03:20:23.917 --> 03:20:28.560]  I'm stepping in for the next three segments and I've been listening, watching the show today.
[03:20:28.580 --> 03:20:36.445]  Alex's opening segment hit the mark perfectly about what's really at stake and how we need to expand our view of what's happening.
[03:20:36.465 --> 03:20:38.386]  I've also been listening to the callers.
[03:20:39.099 --> 03:20:41.800]  I want to say bless all of you who have called.
[03:20:41.820 --> 03:20:44.461]  It seems to be a very spiritual day for some reason.
[03:20:44.481 --> 03:20:56.686]  There's a spiritual moment of awakening happening right now where all of us realize that the intense evil of the Democrats, how they are willing to steal elections and commit fraud and lie,
[03:20:57.467 --> 03:21:09.256]  Lie to the voters, and lie to win elections, and how they're willing to commit deep state treason, and how the media is so dishonest they just blatantly lie about that Jim Acosta video, for example.
[03:21:09.956 --> 03:21:14.700]  The realization is that this is not simply a war about what are facts.
[03:21:15.240 --> 03:21:17.442]  This isn't a war about different points of view.
[03:21:18.102 --> 03:21:22.846]  This is a spiritual war, and it's a war that has at stake
[03:21:23.553 --> 03:21:30.476]  The sustainability of even human consciousness or human souls on this earth.
[03:21:30.596 --> 03:21:36.959]  And so this is a really important time for us to step back and get a big, big picture, a cosmic picture.
[03:21:36.979 --> 03:21:46.624]  You might say a spiritual picture, a divine picture about what's actually happening and understand where the causes are of these problems that we are now experiencing.
[03:21:46.664 --> 03:21:49.265]  Because look, the Democrats are
[03:21:50.384 --> 03:21:55.527]  They're operating not only with a complete lack of good faith now, when it comes to elections.
[03:21:55.547 --> 03:22:03.171]  They're operating with intense evil, as if they have been taken over and the humanity has been drained out of them.
[03:22:03.791 --> 03:22:09.774]  And there are just, let's say metaphorically, just demonic spirits now operating those Democrats.
[03:22:10.254 --> 03:22:17.698]  And through that demonic spirit, they're trying to crush all human dignity, crush consciousness, destroy truth.
[03:22:18.248 --> 03:22:21.430]  Destroy the lives of unborn babies as well.
[03:22:21.610 --> 03:22:24.312]  They revel in death and suffering.
[03:22:24.913 --> 03:22:26.914]  And their policies create suffering.
[03:22:27.495 --> 03:22:32.058]  And yet they can never take responsibility for their policies and the effects that they create.
[03:22:32.578 --> 03:22:33.659]  They always have to blame Trump.
[03:22:33.679 --> 03:22:35.660]  Or they have to blame the Russians.
[03:22:35.700 --> 03:22:43.446]  They have to make up something to blame because they can never blame themselves for the hellish outcomes that they have created.
[03:22:44.306 --> 03:22:47.609]  And so our role in this, and I promise I'm going to get more practical here, this isn't just
[03:22:48.869 --> 03:22:49.810]  A spiritual discussion.
[03:22:50.571 --> 03:22:54.534]  Our role is to, number one, recognize what's happening.
[03:22:54.995 --> 03:23:01.060]  Recognize that this is a spiritual battle taking place and that they don't just want our society.
[03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:03.942]  They don't just want control of the House or control of the Senate.
[03:23:04.863 --> 03:23:06.665]  They want our souls.
[03:23:07.185 --> 03:23:11.629]  They want to crush and destroy everything that is of God.
[03:23:12.450 --> 03:23:15.773]  Do you understand the severity of their attack?
[03:23:16.540 --> 03:23:20.003]  On our entire universe, you might even say.
[03:23:20.043 --> 03:23:27.048]  It's an attack on God and all those who embrace what is divine.
[03:23:27.709 --> 03:23:32.492]  It's not just running, controlling America or overrunning America.
[03:23:32.512 --> 03:23:33.313]  That's one of their goals.
[03:23:33.573 --> 03:23:36.555]  But that's on the way to overrunning God.
[03:23:36.575 --> 03:23:40.178]  Now, let me share something with you.
[03:23:40.198 --> 03:23:42.920]  There was a book written a few years ago called Proof of Heaven.
[03:23:43.655 --> 03:23:44.736]  By a neurosurgeon.
[03:23:45.236 --> 03:23:47.477]  His name is Eben Alexander.
[03:23:47.977 --> 03:23:50.918]  And Eben Alexander was a skeptic.
[03:23:50.958 --> 03:23:53.560]  He was a neurosurgeon trained in conventional medicine.
[03:23:54.140 --> 03:23:55.621]  Trained as a scientist, obviously.
[03:23:55.641 --> 03:23:57.521]  And he didn't believe in God.
[03:23:57.922 --> 03:24:00.863]  He didn't believe in anything that smacked of religion.
[03:24:01.523 --> 03:24:02.844]  He wasn't interested in any of that.
[03:24:02.924 --> 03:24:05.085]  He just wanted to live on this earth.
[03:24:05.165 --> 03:24:08.146]  And he thought that there was no life after death.
[03:24:08.366 --> 03:24:11.788]  And so, like most people on the left, he was really an atheist.
[03:24:12.441 --> 03:24:14.442]  Who thought there would be no repercussions for his actions.
[03:24:14.882 --> 03:24:20.964]  Well, he suffered a very extreme infection of his brain that actually killed him.
[03:24:21.024 --> 03:24:24.065]  He died in the hospital due to this brain infection.
[03:24:24.085 --> 03:24:27.245]  It was the most severe infection that many doctors had ever seen.
[03:24:27.646 --> 03:24:33.607]  And he spent several days in a coma followed by actual death.
[03:24:34.728 --> 03:24:39.389]  And during this time, he experienced what he describes as proof of heaven.
[03:24:40.009 --> 03:24:41.890]  He experienced both hell
[03:24:43.058 --> 03:24:43.978]  And heaven.
[03:24:44.118 --> 03:24:51.101]  He experienced a timeless torture of hell, as if he was existing in hell for infinity.
[03:24:51.701 --> 03:24:52.702]  It was timeless, he said.
[03:24:52.742 --> 03:24:54.622]  There was no experience of the flow of time.
[03:24:54.642 --> 03:25:00.725]  And then out of that, he was saved by actual God, as he describes it.
[03:25:00.765 --> 03:25:03.646]  And he felt a tremendous love and acceptance.
[03:25:03.726 --> 03:25:11.689]  And he felt and sensed more intense emotions and a sense of reality and consciousness than he had ever experienced in his entire life.
[03:25:12.719 --> 03:25:15.461]  During this time, his brain was not functioning.
[03:25:16.001 --> 03:25:17.041]  He was brain dead.
[03:25:17.582 --> 03:25:21.864]  And so all those theories that say, oh no, these are just artifacts of neurology, those are false.
[03:25:22.744 --> 03:25:28.307]  This man, Eben Alexander, experienced actual hell and then heaven.
[03:25:28.708 --> 03:25:33.830]  And the reason I mention this is because when he came back to life, he was actually saved by God.
[03:25:33.890 --> 03:25:35.711]  He was actually brought back into his body.
[03:25:36.352 --> 03:25:40.874]  Somehow he woke up from this, his infection was healed, and he lived to write this book.
[03:25:41.515 --> 03:25:42.115]  And what he said,
[03:25:43.391 --> 03:25:58.133]  In this book, it's very important, is that Earth is a battlefield for a cosmic spiritual battle, and there is a higher concentration of evil on Earth than at any other point in the entire universe.
[03:25:58.931 --> 03:26:04.616]  He said that the universe is a place of love and a place of, well, what you might call liberty.
[03:26:04.656 --> 03:26:10.000]  That's my term, not his, but a place of love, a place of divinity throughout the entire cosmos.
[03:26:10.480 --> 03:26:18.607]  And yet there's this one place, which is Earth, where what he described as hellish Satan is trying to take over.
[03:26:19.707 --> 03:26:21.629]  You and I happen to be on this battlefield.
[03:26:22.432 --> 03:26:32.834]  And so don't be surprised when there is so much evil that is attempting to assert power and attempting to steal power away from those who are good.
[03:26:33.314 --> 03:26:51.358]  Don't be surprised when evil gains a foothold or when so many people who maybe used to be reasonable people are literally infected or infested with demonic forces because Earth is a battlefield of, you know, in Scripture it's called, you know, fallen angels.
[03:26:52.461 --> 03:26:53.302]  It is a battlefield.
[03:26:53.643 --> 03:26:57.289]  There's an epic cosmic battle between evil and good taking place here.
[03:26:57.629 --> 03:26:58.571]  It's not a metaphor.
[03:26:59.112 --> 03:27:01.836]  It's not just some ancient scripture that didn't happen.
[03:27:02.237 --> 03:27:04.100]  This is real and it's happening right now.
[03:27:05.046 --> 03:27:20.491]  And the effects of what we're seeing with these elections, with the push for the genital mutilation of children via transgenderism indoctrination, the push for the murder of late-term babies who are about to be born.
[03:27:21.051 --> 03:27:29.714]  All of these things are extensions of true Satanism and true evil, and it is here, and it surrounds us.
[03:27:30.623 --> 03:27:31.943]  It's everywhere in society.
[03:27:32.383 --> 03:27:36.905]  And when you see what these Democrats are pushing, you know it is an extension of pure evil.
[03:27:37.745 --> 03:27:44.427]  I'm just here to tell you today, and in the upcoming segments, I'm going to give you some things, what we can do to fight this evil, by the way.
[03:27:45.207 --> 03:27:46.527]  Because it's more than just praying.
[03:27:46.627 --> 03:27:49.548]  We must pray, but we must also do other things as well.
[03:27:49.608 --> 03:27:53.469]  God wants you to do certain things to empower yourself.
[03:27:54.361 --> 03:27:55.622]  Otherwise we wouldn't have free will.
[03:27:55.662 --> 03:27:56.583]  So I'll talk about that.
[03:27:57.043 --> 03:28:11.614]  But I want you to understand that at a very deep level, at a very real level, we are in a spiritual battle that has been taking place for thousands of years and will continue to take place for thousands of years beyond our short lives.
[03:28:12.134 --> 03:28:20.440]  And that while we are here in these human lives with divine spirit, you know, body, mind and soul, it is our job
[03:28:21.440 --> 03:28:30.463]  To fight against evil and to defend and protect the divine and to serve, frankly, life and God.
[03:28:31.083 --> 03:28:32.324]  That's what our mission is here.
[03:28:32.404 --> 03:28:33.284]  That's what we are doing.
[03:28:33.964 --> 03:28:38.305]  And we must never lose that perspective of how important it is what we are doing.
[03:28:38.385 --> 03:28:45.908]  So when we come back, I'll share more specific details about how we can win this fight against evil and protect our world
[03:28:46.778 --> 03:28:51.036]  For those who are willing to live life to its fullest.
[03:28:51.097 --> 03:28:51.659]  We'll be right back.
[03:28:55.421 --> 03:28:56.762]  My message to the President is this.
[03:28:57.402 --> 03:29:02.406]  I respect you, you've done incredible work, despite all these balls and chains tied around your ankles.
[03:29:02.967 --> 03:29:13.414]  But if you don't get these people off your back, and these corrupt mobsters and these criminals that have blocked America's recovery, then you become someone aiding and abetting the system, and I can only believe they've gotten to you.
[03:29:13.875 --> 03:29:24.723]  So in the next chapter, get ready, because the Republicans better get off their asses and take action to defend this country, or they are going to be seen as part of the problem.
[03:29:27.839 --> 03:29:38.163]  It is only the development and the advent of a robust alternative media based in the Internet that allowed for your election, Mr. President.
[03:29:38.764 --> 03:29:45.206]  You out-communicated the networks and the mainstream media through the Internet.
[03:29:45.426 --> 03:29:46.687]  That's how you won.
[03:29:46.987 --> 03:29:48.508]  And you were a master at it.
[03:29:49.188 --> 03:29:54.329]  Now, they want to put the toothpaste back in the tube, and you've seen the impact in this election.
[03:29:54.929 --> 03:30:05.351]  Allowing the Democrats to take control of Facebook, which is the single most important effective tool in a local congressional race, was a death wish.
[03:30:05.971 --> 03:30:09.052]  Where was the complaint from the Republican National Committee?
[03:30:09.332 --> 03:30:13.113]  Which, sir, you controlled, and you could have made happen.
[03:30:13.253 --> 03:30:14.753]  And they thought you were so ignorant,
[03:30:15.213 --> 03:30:15.433]  I think?
[03:30:35.942 --> 03:30:47.971]  Let's be clear, it's not just the right thing to do, it's also a way to change the narrative from the squeamish, anemic victory the Democrats just had, thanks to Republican ineptness.
[03:31:01.261 --> 03:31:04.324]  He needs to, tomorrow, fire them to change the narrative.
[03:31:04.344 --> 03:31:12.632]  Having tasted this narrow victory tonight, the Democrats will, and their tech giant allies, will push internet censorship even further.
[03:31:12.912 --> 03:31:15.034]  That's more decapitations at Facebook.
[03:31:15.374 --> 03:31:18.818]  That's more censorship at Twitter and Reddit.
[03:31:19.318 --> 03:31:23.182]  And that is the eradication of InfoWars from the face of the planet.
[03:31:25.660 --> 03:31:27.621]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:31:28.021 --> 03:31:34.283]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[03:32:59.236 --> 03:33:08.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.960 --> 03:33:11.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:12.381 --> 03:33:16.263]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:21.325 --> 03:33:25.154]  Alright, for this segment, I'd like to ask for callers.
[03:33:25.174 --> 03:33:29.685]  I don't normally do this, but because of what's happening today, the level of spiritual awareness...
[03:33:30.345 --> 03:33:45.410]  I'd like to invite you to call in if you've got a real event, something that happened to you, where you were touched by divine inspiration pertaining to this battle that's happening, this spiritual war that's happening.
[03:33:45.750 --> 03:33:46.910]  How did you wake up?
[03:33:46.970 --> 03:33:48.511]  How were you touched by God?
[03:33:48.951 --> 03:33:51.752]  How did you come to expand your consciousness?
[03:33:51.772 --> 03:33:52.512]  The phone number is 877-789-ALEX.
[03:33:55.743 --> 03:34:00.406]  Or 877-789-2539 is what that comes out to.
[03:34:00.466 --> 03:34:02.948]  So we'll take those calls here in a few minutes.
[03:34:03.628 --> 03:34:17.518]  Until we get to those calls, I want to remind you that part of this war on humanity involves actual depopulation, actual eugenics, and the mass poisoning of human beings.
[03:34:18.118 --> 03:34:21.740]  And so this mass poisoning is taking place through multiple vectors.
[03:34:22.601 --> 03:34:25.363]  And I've actually done a number of lectures on this over the years, but
[03:34:26.474 --> 03:34:30.078]  Just to summarize my findings, the United Nations is key to this.
[03:34:30.138 --> 03:34:42.850]  The United Nations spiked vaccines given to women in Kenya with infertility chemicals to cause spontaneous abortions and, of course, long-term infertility.
[03:34:42.890 --> 03:34:46.754]  This was actually discovered by the Kenyan Council of Bishops.
[03:34:46.774 --> 03:34:47.995]  I believe that's their name.
[03:34:48.475 --> 03:34:49.957]  They're bishops who are pro-vaccine.
[03:34:50.586 --> 03:34:54.287]  They go around giving vaccines to women in Kenya.
[03:34:54.307 --> 03:34:55.307]  Well, women and men, both.
[03:34:55.808 --> 03:35:03.690]  But they found that as they were giving these vaccines to women, all these women would lose their babies, or they would not be able to get pregnant for an extended period of time.
[03:35:03.970 --> 03:35:14.893]  So they sent the vaccines to four different laboratories, and they found, confirmed in those labs, that these vaccines, which are UN-approved vaccines, had been spiked with infertility chemicals.
[03:35:16.394 --> 03:35:17.394]  So in Africa today,
[03:35:18.516 --> 03:35:21.919]  There is a globalist effort to kill off black people.
[03:35:22.079 --> 03:35:24.541]  This is eugenics and it is globalist run.
[03:35:25.001 --> 03:35:26.462]  It's approved by the United Nations.
[03:35:26.522 --> 03:35:27.463]  It's just an extension.
[03:35:27.503 --> 03:35:35.449]  It's just really a demonstration of the kind of evil that I mentioned is rising in the last hour.
[03:35:35.509 --> 03:35:37.631]  This evil that wants to destroy humanity.
[03:35:38.392 --> 03:35:47.479]  And they are specifically targeting not only the women in Kenya, but also men in the entire African continent.
[03:35:48.750 --> 03:36:05.734]  I have to remind you, back in 1971, the science advisor to Richard Nixon at the time was quoted by the New York Times saying that they wanted to put infertility chemicals into the food supply exported from the United States that would be consumed by Africans.
[03:36:06.414 --> 03:36:16.637]  And the idea was at that time to spike all the food in developing nations to collapse their populations and carry out mass eugenics programs.
[03:36:18.965 --> 03:36:28.188]  What has happened since then, though, in addition to the eugenics that's taking place in Africa, the United Nations is now calling for third world nations to invade first world nations.
[03:36:28.528 --> 03:36:31.889]  And you may say, well, wait a minute, I thought they wanted to kill third world nation people.
[03:36:32.389 --> 03:36:43.513]  Well, they did, but now they understand that third world nation migrants can become the conquerors to overrun sovereign nations like the United States that are resisting globalist control.
[03:36:44.173 --> 03:37:08.001]  So the real plan here is to use third world nation migrants to invade first world nations and then unleash a global killer, which of course will be an outbreak of infectious disease, Ebola or superbugs such as MRSA or others that are being, of course, developed in laboratories in the United Nations and elsewhere around the world.
[03:37:08.661 --> 03:37:11.042]  They do not want humanity to survive.
[03:37:12.243 --> 03:37:13.003]  They want to kill you.
[03:37:13.846 --> 03:37:22.170]  And some of the vectors that they're using to weaken your minds and weaken your bodies in order to control you include 5G.
[03:37:22.750 --> 03:37:31.594]  This is, of course, an electromagnetic saturation of the human nervous system with cancer causing, essentially ionizing radiation.
[03:37:32.374 --> 03:37:33.955]  They're also using the chemical route.
[03:37:34.075 --> 03:37:40.198]  So if you want to know whether fluoride works to keep people dumbed down, just look at the midterm elections.
[03:37:41.550 --> 03:37:46.054]  Look, half of America, it seems, voted for their own enslavement and financial demise.
[03:37:47.015 --> 03:37:51.940]  Fluoride, which is especially prevalent in the cities, has that effect.
[03:37:52.120 --> 03:37:53.982]  It is turning people against themselves.
[03:37:54.002 --> 03:37:55.964]  It's turning humanity into a suicide cult.
[03:37:56.885 --> 03:38:04.553]  And you see this effect most prominently in Democrat areas, which happen to be urban areas, where there is more fluoride dripped into the water supply.
[03:38:05.763 --> 03:38:11.851]  In addition, the food supply is systematically and deliberately poisoned with pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals.
[03:38:12.552 --> 03:38:20.201]  We just published a story today on Natural News that talks about how pesticides have been proven to cause autism when they're consumed by expectant mothers.
[03:38:20.874 --> 03:38:22.415]  So the food supply is poison.
[03:38:22.796 --> 03:38:24.857]  That is a scientific fact.
[03:38:25.037 --> 03:38:26.278]  There is no debate.
[03:38:26.639 --> 03:38:27.720]  The food supply is poison.
[03:38:28.040 --> 03:38:32.684]  The food supply causes infertility, causes mutations, causes birth defects.
[03:38:33.084 --> 03:38:37.968]  And this is what humanity is eating and feeding upon by design.
[03:38:38.148 --> 03:38:39.049]  It's not an accident.
[03:38:39.209 --> 03:38:40.850]  It is by design.
[03:38:40.890 --> 03:38:41.831]  So with that said,
[03:38:42.461 --> 03:38:44.282]  I want to take a few calls.
[03:38:44.302 --> 03:38:47.503]  Now, I don't have the caller board here since I'm joining remote.
[03:38:47.583 --> 03:38:52.185]  So guys who are running the board, just go ahead and give me a name and a caller and we'll take that call.
[03:38:53.186 --> 03:38:54.186]  Jeb in Canada.
[03:38:54.206 --> 03:38:54.846]  Did I get that right?
[03:38:56.547 --> 03:38:57.147]  Jeff, I'm sorry.
[03:38:57.207 --> 03:38:58.348]  Jeff in Canada.
[03:38:58.628 --> 03:38:58.908]  Go ahead.
[03:38:58.948 --> 03:38:59.889]  You're live with Mike Adams.
[03:38:59.909 --> 03:39:00.229]  Go ahead.
[03:39:01.989 --> 03:39:02.790]  Hey, Mike.
[03:39:03.350 --> 03:39:04.190]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:39:04.771 --> 03:39:10.233]  Yeah, I really think the show today is completely on target.
[03:39:11.014 --> 03:39:12.435]  And I just want to bring up a point.
[03:39:13.575 --> 03:39:32.482]  You know, with all the multi-layered attack that we've been under from the globalists, and I believe from the beginning of the fall of man, there's always been one ultimate target of the globalists, and that is the person of Jesus Christ.
[03:39:33.550 --> 03:39:56.561]  The attack has always been layering up to that, and the elimination of Christ, because Christ is the operating system of the earth, according to the Bible, which I believe, and they're doing everything they can to destroy us, but the ultimate destruction, as we know as Christians, is the destruction of the soul.
[03:39:57.502 --> 03:39:59.483]  And I really believe that
[03:40:00.689 --> 03:40:20.862]  The watering down of the Gospel, what the Gospel actually states, is sort of under the radar, but it's shown in the weakness of the Church and the believers just to simply believe who God is and what He's done for all humanity.
[03:40:22.323 --> 03:40:23.384]  You're exactly right on point.
[03:40:24.042 --> 03:40:25.082]  You're right on track, Jeff.
[03:40:25.942 --> 03:40:36.724]  My comment there is, yes, so many of the churches have been taken over by globalists, and the attack on Christ and the attack on Christianity has accelerated like crazy under the Democrats.
[03:40:37.464 --> 03:40:50.867]  But let me ask you before I let you go, has anything appeared to you or occurred to you that things are going to change, or do you think we're going to just keep having to defend ourselves against these spiritual assaults?
[03:40:52.628 --> 03:41:04.270]  Well, I think, first off, people who are open to Christ or who have confessed Christ, we really need to experience reformation.
[03:41:04.350 --> 03:41:07.951]  Even beyond reformation is restoration to the original plan of God.
[03:41:08.011 --> 03:41:14.552]  God loves us, and He just simply asks us to believe who He is and to operate within Him.
[03:41:15.493 --> 03:41:21.834]  And I believe we need a real reformation to Jesus Christ.
[03:41:22.501 --> 03:41:28.324]  Christ died for the sins of all people, and that debt has been paid.
[03:41:28.364 --> 03:41:33.727]  That was a contract between the Father and the Son, and that is finished, and God just simply asked us to believe it.
[03:41:33.807 --> 03:41:35.368]  It's not a ladder to get to God.
[03:41:35.888 --> 03:41:43.272]  It's a simple belief in that God loves us, and He cares for us, and that He has an inheritance, an identity, and value for us.
[03:41:44.012 --> 03:41:51.236]  So, what I would say is, everybody has to, you know, have their due face-to-face with Jesus, because you're going to face Him one way or another.
[03:41:52.313 --> 03:41:52.794]  Well said.
[03:41:52.814 --> 03:41:56.176]  Sorry to interrupt, but I have a comment on that.
[03:41:56.216 --> 03:41:57.357]  Thank you for the call, Jeff.
[03:41:57.377 --> 03:41:57.777]  Well said.
[03:41:58.077 --> 03:42:09.164]  I jokingly wrote this morning that if Democrats actually weren't atheists, if they did believe in God, they would pray to God and say, Dear God, please save me from the consequences of my own actions.
[03:42:09.664 --> 03:42:13.326]  Because what they're setting into motion is hell on earth.
[03:42:13.827 --> 03:42:15.188]  That's what Democrats are creating.
[03:42:15.868 --> 03:42:20.571]  And yet they somehow think that they will not have to face the repercussions of what they have
[03:42:21.171 --> 03:42:43.637]  Wrought and yet they will because as you said Jeff they will face God they will face judgment for their actions there is a human soul that that persists beyond this life that survives this life and That soul will have a lot to answer for a lot of people our job is to make sure that we serve Higher purpose while we are here.
[03:42:43.657 --> 03:42:48.398]  We'll be right back with more listen to the Alex Jones Show Mike Adams filling in we'll be right back
[03:42:56.066 --> 03:43:06.073]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.

[03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:18.983]  So let me take my Knockout first.

[03:43:55.800 --> 03:44:04.028]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:44:04.228 --> 03:44:05.469]  Believe me, I know.
[03:44:05.689 --> 03:44:10.013]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:44:10.433 --> 03:44:15.458]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:44:15.678 --> 03:44:35.926]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:44:36.426 --> 03:44:40.168]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:44:58.502 --> 03:45:00.643]  Chase the Patriot from California.
[03:45:01.003 --> 03:45:01.603]  Hello Alex.
[03:45:02.003 --> 03:45:03.183]  Chase, welcome to the airwaves.
[03:45:03.283 --> 03:45:06.024]  This is Chase the Patriot from the front lines of California.
[03:45:06.064 --> 03:45:09.225]  So, I took your reporter challenge on YouTube, Chase the Patriot.
[03:45:09.265 --> 03:45:12.226]  I've been filing reports every single day, but I've noticed a trend.
[03:45:12.326 --> 03:45:15.086]  And there's this false confidence of the Democrats again.
[03:45:15.126 --> 03:45:16.747]  The same thing we saw in the 2016 election.
[03:45:17.987 --> 03:45:20.990]  So it's up to us to counter the narrative and to counter their lies.
[03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:26.295]  And one way I do it is with my YouTube page, but also it's through your t-shirts and your hats, Alex.
[03:45:26.355 --> 03:45:28.577]  I want to promote your t-shirts to everyone out there.
[03:45:28.657 --> 03:45:35.484]  They are great ways to meet people who have like-minds, and they start conversations, and you find patriots.
[03:45:35.624 --> 03:45:38.007]  And it's a great way to spread good messages out there.
[03:45:38.027 --> 03:45:39.448]  So I highly recommend it, Alex.
[03:45:39.608 --> 03:45:40.289]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:42.552]  When I say these shirts are like shoes you're on adventure.
[03:45:43.013 --> 03:45:46.338]  Wear a mohawn lombe, you'll only meet fellow patriots and gun owners, which is great.
[03:45:46.458 --> 03:45:51.605]  Wear a, you know, big obnoxious InfoWars shirt in red or a Trump-Pence shirt, you're gonna meet your friends and your enemies.
[03:45:51.645 --> 03:45:55.731]  So it's a really great way to spread the word and exercise free speech in the third dimension.
[03:45:55.851 --> 03:45:58.213]  Hey, and one more suggestion on that.
[03:45:58.273 --> 03:46:13.644]  You know, a lot of us have, we might have, I don't want to give away anything, but some of us might have a concealed carry, and I would like to see a button-up shirt long enough that I can wear untucked so I can still carry on my hip a pistol, and that's something if you put like a little American flag on the armband.
[03:46:13.664 --> 03:46:14.925]  Oh, it's total genius.
[03:46:14.985 --> 03:46:19.048]  The Info Wars, the Info Wars concealed carry shirt for men and women.
[03:46:19.128 --> 03:46:23.151]  Kind of like a cargo shirt, or like a bowling shirt, or like a...
[03:46:24.432 --> 03:46:30.115]  A utility shirt, and it's got an American flag, it's black, and it's got that, you know, it's not tapered, it kind of flanks out.
[03:46:30.455 --> 03:46:30.956]  That's perfect.
[03:46:30.996 --> 03:46:34.938]  Yeah, and you know, something you can wear to the office and nobody really knows what's going on.
[03:46:35.038 --> 03:46:37.359]  It just looks like a normal shirt they got from the mall.
[03:46:37.399 --> 03:46:40.721]  But if you can support the cause, you know, somebody asks, hey, where'd you get that shirt?
[03:46:40.801 --> 03:46:42.842]  It'll say Infowars.com on the inside.
[03:46:43.022 --> 03:46:43.683]  Absolutely.
[03:46:43.703 --> 03:46:44.563]  We need to branch out.
[03:46:44.583 --> 03:46:46.964]  We've got so many great t-shirts, so many for men and women.
[03:46:47.284 --> 03:46:47.765]  Ball caps.
[03:46:47.825 --> 03:46:48.605]  I don't even promote them anymore.
[03:46:48.625 --> 03:46:51.747]  We've got the best shirts we've ever had, and that's something I never even talk about.
[03:46:52.027 --> 03:46:53.028]  So thanks for calling Chase.
[03:46:53.048 --> 03:46:53.508]  God bless you.
[03:46:59.258 --> 03:47:01.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:10.127 --> 03:47:16.612]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams.
[03:47:17.192 --> 03:47:19.975]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.230 --> 03:47:26.452]  Prepare to be really blown away by the information I'm going to reveal in this segment.
[03:47:26.472 --> 03:47:34.318]  These are some practical solutions to protect your body, mind, and spirit from the spiritual assault that's targeting all of humanity right now.
[03:47:34.338 --> 03:47:47.426]  And it is that spiritual assault that is causing us to see the symptoms of that, the demonization of society, the demon crats trying to gain power through thievery and cheating and so on.
[03:47:48.928 --> 03:47:50.890]  As a scientist, you know, I run a lab.
[03:47:51.250 --> 03:47:52.411]  I'm a published scientist.
[03:47:52.791 --> 03:47:59.457]  I know the role of nutrition in protecting your mind, but I'm going to go beyond nutrition science here and mention a couple of things.
[03:48:01.259 --> 03:48:01.939]  But we'll start with that.
[03:48:01.979 --> 03:48:03.881]  The basics are your brain
[03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:13.246]  Can be protected by a vast array of nutrients, and these nutrients include curcumin in turmeric, for example.
[03:48:13.286 --> 03:48:15.868]  They include nutrients that are found in green tea.
[03:48:16.208 --> 03:48:23.033]  They include nutrients that are found in medicinal mushrooms or Chinese medicine and Western herbs and many others.
[03:48:23.233 --> 03:48:32.960]  And even though I'm not here to plug Alex's products, I don't have any financial ties to Alex's products, but iodine has something about it that you may have never known.
[03:48:34.072 --> 03:48:44.235]  Iodine, not only is it a trace element, but did you know that the atomic mass of iodine, 127, is a prime number, which is considered a cosmic number.
[03:48:44.675 --> 03:48:57.018]  Some people believe, and this isn't really a scientific sentence here, but many people believe from a spiritual point of view that God speaks to us through mathematics and specifically prime numbers.
[03:48:57.538 --> 03:49:11.291]  If you go back into the history of mathematics, you find a lot of cases where there were Christians who were scientists who believed in the power of prime numbers because they were unique numbers.
[03:49:11.892 --> 03:49:22.442]  I know this is a fascinating discussion, but iodine is believed by many people in nutrition and consciousness to actually connect
[03:49:24.174 --> 03:49:25.655]  Your brain to consciousness.
[03:49:25.675 --> 03:49:29.618]  And again, I understand this is not a scientific statement here, but it's something for you to explore.
[03:49:29.718 --> 03:49:30.759]  Just look into this.
[03:49:31.379 --> 03:49:40.127]  There's a consciousness element that is iodine, and it happens to be the atomic mass of 127, which is a prime number.
[03:49:40.147 --> 03:49:49.374]  It's also 2 to the power of 7 minus 1, by the way, with 7 being, of course, a biblical scripture number, you know, the seven signs and seven
[03:49:50.775 --> 03:49:51.575]  Bells and so on.
[03:49:51.895 --> 03:49:52.636]  So that's fascinating.
[03:49:52.776 --> 03:49:53.596]  2 to the power of 7.
[03:49:54.896 --> 03:49:56.216]  2 being a binary.
[03:49:56.537 --> 03:50:00.698]  So a binary number to the power of 7 minus 1 is 127.
[03:50:01.098 --> 03:50:06.539]  It's also interesting from a scientific point of view that iodine is not a polyatomic element.
[03:50:07.079 --> 03:50:12.541]  What I mean is it doesn't exist in its natural form in any other mass other than 127.
[03:50:14.173 --> 03:50:18.237]  Now, it can exist in 131, which is a radioisotope, but that's not normal.
[03:50:18.277 --> 03:50:20.619]  That's not a naturally occurring isotope.
[03:50:21.019 --> 03:50:25.763]  There are many metals, such as lead, that naturally occur in other atomic masses.
[03:50:26.523 --> 03:50:27.764]  Lead, for example, is 206, 208.
[03:50:29.626 --> 03:50:33.950]  Mercury is both 200, 201, and 202 simultaneously.
[03:50:33.970 --> 03:50:35.431]  Those are called polyatomic elements.
[03:50:36.351 --> 03:50:37.492]  But iodine is not that way.
[03:50:37.613 --> 03:50:38.473]  Iodine is always at 127.
[03:50:40.126 --> 03:50:45.408]  And if you look at atoms and atomic structure, you understand that atoms are harmonics.
[03:50:46.328 --> 03:50:49.629]  And I'm not going to get too much in depth here, but something for you to explore.
[03:50:50.369 --> 03:51:07.994]  The harmonics of iodine have something very, very unique about them that, of course, it's unique not only from a scientific perspective on the table of elements, but it's also very rare to have something that is nutritionally used to protect cognitive function and to protect neurology
[03:51:08.973 --> 03:51:09.193]  Thank you.
[03:51:25.683 --> 03:51:28.964]  is something that protects your mind and protects your brain.
[03:51:29.484 --> 03:51:43.989]  And if you don't have good nutrition, then you're subject to the mass poisoning of pesticides and fluoride and all the other chemicals, the toxic fragrance chemicals that people have in their perfumes and their laundry detergents and dryer sheets and so on.
[03:51:44.769 --> 03:51:47.930]  And if I could summarize what I'm trying to say here, then I'll go to some calls.
[03:51:48.131 --> 03:51:50.591]  It is people, please, I beg of you.
[03:51:50.711 --> 03:51:51.312]  I pray for you.
[03:51:51.352 --> 03:51:52.312]  Stop poisoning yourself.
[03:51:53.098 --> 03:52:02.303]  Stop poisoning yourself with toxic chemicals and instead take in the substances that are going to not only protect you, but even can help enlighten you.
[03:52:02.663 --> 03:52:03.664]  And that's no joke.
[03:52:04.164 --> 03:52:14.950]  If you look in the Bible and you look at even world religions, people around the world who were the gurus or the saints or the religious leaders, they would get away from
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:17.401]  What was the processed food of the day?
[03:52:17.441 --> 03:52:18.541]  They would go out into nature.
[03:52:18.601 --> 03:52:19.682]  They would sometimes fast.
[03:52:19.742 --> 03:52:21.103]  They would drink clean water.
[03:52:21.443 --> 03:52:22.463]  They would eat herbs.
[03:52:23.044 --> 03:52:24.364]  They would eat the roots.
[03:52:24.444 --> 03:52:28.906]  They would take the natural products like the turmeric roots or the onions in the ground.
[03:52:28.946 --> 03:52:35.210]  They would eat the herbs and then they would have an epiphany because they're having such clarity in that moment.
[03:52:35.810 --> 03:52:37.411]  Because suddenly they're not polluted.
[03:52:37.451 --> 03:52:39.772]  Their brains aren't intoxicated, literally.
[03:52:40.392 --> 03:52:44.134]  And yet society today is full of so much poison
[03:52:44.958 --> 03:52:49.780]  That by comparison, a biblical diet in that day would now be considered all organic.
[03:52:50.921 --> 03:52:53.762]  What people ate in biblical times was all organic.
[03:52:54.242 --> 03:52:59.785]  And yet today, you see people filing in and out of churches and their health is in very bad shape.
[03:53:00.445 --> 03:53:01.386]  They're eating junk food.
[03:53:01.426 --> 03:53:04.427]  Sometimes the church is putting on an event and it's serving them donuts.
[03:53:04.807 --> 03:53:05.668]  I mean, give me a break.
[03:53:05.808 --> 03:53:08.929]  That's not in alignment with Scripture.
[03:53:08.969 --> 03:53:10.150]  That's not in alignment with God.
[03:53:10.740 --> 03:53:17.826]  So stop poisoning your body and start nourishing your body and you will find effects that go beyond the mere physical.
[03:53:18.346 --> 03:53:19.667]  They go to the spiritual.
[03:53:20.247 --> 03:53:23.230]  And yes, I'm not telling you everything I know on this subject.
[03:53:23.250 --> 03:53:28.694]  I'm just kind of giving you enough of a tease that you will do some more research yourself and find out.
[03:53:29.534 --> 03:53:32.036]  I'm not even talking about psychedelic drugs or anything like that.
[03:53:32.056 --> 03:53:34.178]  I'm just talking about straight up nutrition.
[03:53:35.639 --> 03:53:36.980]  Phytonutrients from plants.
[03:53:37.040 --> 03:53:39.102]  Now, I want to go to some calls here.
[03:53:39.182 --> 03:53:40.503]  We've got a few more callers lined up.
[03:53:41.044 --> 03:53:43.146]  Let's go to Brian in Illinois.
[03:53:43.467 --> 03:53:44.989]  Brian, you're live with Mike Adams.
[03:53:46.050 --> 03:53:49.033]  Thank you for your patience as I unveiled all that.
[03:53:49.073 --> 03:53:50.715]  Go ahead, what's your comment or question?
[03:53:51.996 --> 03:53:56.902]  Yeah, my comment is that you are extremely right about our nutrition and what we need to put in our bodies.
[03:53:57.883 --> 03:54:00.586]  And the one thing that I'm seeing right now as far as
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:02.581]  Thank you for having me.
[03:54:17.546 --> 03:54:21.511]  People are not able to eat the healthy food that's in health food stores or grow it.
[03:54:22.132 --> 03:54:25.155]  Most of the time, well, they can grow it, but it's just like they're in different states.
[03:54:25.316 --> 03:54:29.801]  It's winter, it's summer in different states, but there are a lot of weather patterns due to chemtrails, too.
[03:54:29.821 --> 03:54:33.045]  But the reason why we're not able to buy it is because we can't afford it.
[03:54:33.065 --> 03:54:33.486]  That's why
[03:54:33.986 --> 03:54:38.290]  We save our money to buy these organic ingredients, but we'll have to grow them ourselves.
[03:54:38.330 --> 03:54:41.853]  Right, and the conventional foods are, in essence, subsidized by the government.
[03:54:41.913 --> 03:54:47.478]  So, non-organic corn and corn syrup and all that is paid for, in part, by taxpayers.
[03:54:47.538 --> 03:54:50.821]  So, they're punishing us for wanting to eat organic, right?
[03:54:52.054 --> 03:54:53.175]  Yeah, basically, man.
[03:54:53.215 --> 03:54:58.877]  Because, honestly, there are not a lot of health stores in Illinois.
[03:54:58.897 --> 03:54:59.697]  There are very few.
[03:54:59.717 --> 03:55:04.059]  They're in basically secluded towns like Homewood and Park Forest.
[03:55:04.579 --> 03:55:07.901]  And I have to basically take the bus just to get down there.
[03:55:08.861 --> 03:55:10.182]  And there's not a lot of them.
[03:55:10.322 --> 03:55:17.885]  And most of the grocery stores like Walmart, and I'm exposing them, Walmart, Target, Jalisco, they're selling stuff with junk food.
[03:55:17.925 --> 03:55:20.246]  We see a lot of gluten-free, but that's just not enough.
[03:55:23.892 --> 03:55:27.053]  A lot of gluten-free contains glyphosate, by the way.
[03:55:27.594 --> 03:55:28.934]  But you're right on point there, Brian.
[03:55:29.174 --> 03:55:29.895]  I appreciate your call.
[03:55:29.915 --> 03:55:30.935]  I'm going to go to another caller.
[03:55:31.095 --> 03:55:33.577]  Let's get some more comments in before we close out this segment.
[03:55:33.597 --> 03:55:35.718]  Let's go to Lauren in Nevada.
[03:55:36.478 --> 03:55:37.619]  Do I have that name right, Lauren?
[03:55:39.100 --> 03:55:39.340]  Yes.
[03:55:39.640 --> 03:55:40.180]  Hi, Mike.
[03:55:40.941 --> 03:55:41.241]  Hi there.
[03:55:41.701 --> 03:55:42.722]  Can you hear me?
[03:55:42.742 --> 03:55:44.583]  Yeah, you're good.
[03:55:44.603 --> 03:55:44.783]  Go ahead.
[03:55:46.223 --> 03:55:47.524]  It's an honor to speak with you.
[03:55:47.805 --> 03:55:49.226]  I'm a published author.
[03:55:49.246 --> 03:56:06.178]  I haven't published since the 90s, however, but to make a very long story short, my son was born in 1989 and there was no internet or any of that information out, but the Holy Spirit, I believe, told me to give my son only great earth baby food, which is organic.
[03:56:07.339 --> 03:56:12.022]  And I only would allow him things that were organic all his growing up.
[03:56:12.402 --> 03:56:13.523]  We made all his cereal.
[03:56:13.563 --> 03:56:14.524]  We made all his food.
[03:56:16.244 --> 03:56:37.414]  Everything, nothing processed and I also have, was diagnosed, I lived in Northern California in the Emerald Triangle and which is my subject I wanted to ask you about marijuana and Monsanto but I went to Utah, got on prescription drugs to do it for my family for one year.
[03:56:37.474 --> 03:56:41.956]  I said I will do this for one year because they did not believe that marijuana would help me.
[03:56:43.311 --> 03:56:48.337]  And so I did that, and I went to Colorado two years later, and I got off everything.
[03:56:48.357 --> 03:56:50.980]  I need your question real quick, Lauren.
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:51.921]  We're about to run out of time.
[03:56:52.882 --> 03:56:56.666]  Okay, my question is, what do you think about Monsanto and marijuana?
[03:56:57.207 --> 03:56:57.808]  And St.
[03:56:57.848 --> 03:57:01.552]  Louis, they've made a strain of marijuana.
[03:57:02.441 --> 03:57:08.304]  Well, of course, Monsatan is very clear what they represent and the evil that they are.
[03:57:08.924 --> 03:57:13.187]  But marijuana, of course, is a natural plant and a healing plant.
[03:57:14.007 --> 03:57:18.849]  Marijuana, cannabis, should be decentralized and made available to everyone.
[03:57:18.910 --> 03:57:21.151]  Everyone should be able to grow it for medicinal purposes.
[03:57:21.491 --> 03:57:23.932]  We don't want to be monopolized by evil corporations.
[03:57:23.972 --> 03:57:25.773]  That's my view on cannabis.
[03:57:26.213 --> 03:57:27.814]  That plant is here for a purpose.
[03:57:28.074 --> 03:57:31.296]  And it's compatible with human biology.
[03:57:31.940 --> 03:57:37.003]  So, we need to decriminalize cannabis and we need to take our power back from evil corporations.
[03:57:38.004 --> 03:57:39.304]  Thank you all for watching today.
[03:57:39.385 --> 03:57:40.125]  I bless you all.
[03:57:40.225 --> 03:57:40.585]  Prayers.
[03:57:40.605 --> 03:57:42.727]  I'll join you again in another episode.
