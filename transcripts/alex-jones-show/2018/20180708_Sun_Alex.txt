[00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.818]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:32.814 --> 00:00:35.174]  History is unfolding in front of all of us.
[00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:37.555]  It is Sunday, the 8th day of July 2018.
[00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:43.896]  As we are every Sunday, live from 4 to 6 p.m., we are here.
[00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:46.957]  And I am your host, and I'm very honored to be here.
[00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:54.318]  I intend to try to open the phones up for at least an hour and a half of the two-hour broadcast today, because we're overwhelmed with news.
[00:00:54.558 --> 00:00:57.318]  And I don't know where to start, but I want to get your take on it.
[00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.079]  You know, I'm so captivated
[00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:14.937]  By the mine situation down that cave in Thailand, where they've got the divers going down trying to save the young people there with their coach, they've gotten now four out.
[00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:16.638]  Now it's nine out.
[00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:18.319]  Well, that just broke minutes ago.
[00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:21.660]  And they've only got a few more to get out, including their football coach.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.482]  So that's certainly a very, very positive thing.
[00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.703]  But just the way it illustrates
[00:01:31.365 --> 00:01:51.938]  If a little girl or little boy is stuck down a well, or if miners are stuck in a mine collapse, or if people are captured underground, hemmed in by rising water from floods, our humanity comes out and we root for them and we project onto them that they are us.
[00:01:53.218 --> 00:01:57.141]  But if it's little babies getting aborted, or it's euthanizing old people,
[00:01:58.024 --> 00:02:00.306]  Or it's cancer rates going up because of glyphosate.
[00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:02.048]  It's like, eh, so what about humanity?
[00:02:02.068 --> 00:02:04.450]  You know, it gets the highway moving.
[00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.210]  There's too many people.
[00:02:06.952 --> 00:02:25.288]  But this whole situation with the mine cave-ins we've seen, and the gas explosions we've seen, and little girls, little boys falling down wells, and now the situation in the cave, this illustrates to everybody the value of human life, and that we're all in this together.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.141]  And so they've already had one diver die.
[00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:43.510]  They've got other divers going down two at a time trying to get each child out who's got to then swim out in scuba gear in a cave full of mud and everything else out to the surface.
[00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.871]  And I was just reading about it today.
[00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:48.913]  I mean, I've been watching it last four or five days, but I was
[00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:55.713]  Actually really doing a deep dive, no pun intended, into what was now currently happening.
[00:02:56.354 --> 00:03:00.741]  And it just made my head spin because they are way, way, way, way down there.
[00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.112]  And experienced military divers are having big problems.
[00:03:05.172 --> 00:03:05.972]  One's already died.
[00:03:06.513 --> 00:03:11.396]  And so that's why they tried to abandon that process when one diver died trying to get down to him and said, well, let's just wait.
[00:03:11.416 --> 00:03:14.917]  But they can't because another monsoons hit another big rain.
[00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:16.959]  They call the Pacific a monsoon.
[00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:19.140]  The turd floaters, what we call in Texas.
[00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.482]  So you got this huge storm happening and the water's going back up.
[00:03:23.943 --> 00:03:29.386]  And so they're having to send people down into this cave reportedly almost a mile in.
[00:03:30.492 --> 00:03:31.754]  To then try to get these people out.
[00:03:31.854 --> 00:03:32.555]  It is just crazy.
[00:03:32.876 --> 00:03:36.161]  And they're inside a big cavern up on the top of a pinnacle of a rock.
[00:03:37.003 --> 00:03:37.624]  You ever been inside?
[00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:40.143]  The big caverns are in the U.S.
[00:03:40.184 --> 00:03:42.564]  Mammoth Cave or Earlsbad Caverns or others.
[00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:50.067]  There's a huge amphitheater style, 10-story tall, huge caverns.
[00:03:50.967 --> 00:03:53.968]  And you can see those big pinnacles, those big rocks up at the top.
[00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.610]  They are perched up there with the water rising beyond some Hollywood movie.
[00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.052]  So you see with all that's happening, it makes you think about our own planet.
[00:04:04.552 --> 00:04:05.252]  And where we are.
[00:04:06.093 --> 00:04:06.853]  And the fact that
[00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.432]  Humanity is all in this together.
[00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:14.737]  And at value in human life is certainly where it's all at.
[00:04:14.857 --> 00:04:16.680]  So we're gonna be looking at all that today.
[00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.544]  The mainstream media has had a big heyday.
[00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:36.124]  They have come out and said, Jones said it was the end of the world on Wednesday, but it didn't end, because I said the Democrats were calling for civil war, they've been escalating their soft civil war, and I see that as a demarcation line of when they plan, throughout the summer, to ramp things up.
[00:04:36.164 --> 00:04:37.185]  That's what I said was very clear.
[00:04:37.725 --> 00:04:47.791]  But they use the fact that I said, March, July 4th is when they're going to attempt to launch this, and then when the hoax that they pushed didn't appear, they say I'm discredited.
[00:04:48.742 --> 00:04:58.596]  It's simply amazing, even though attacks against conservatives, libertarians and Christians went into overdrive, as you know, the last four days, and we'll chronicle all of that straight ahead.
[00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:11.154]  Western Europe has already banned free speech, and an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:05:11.554 --> 00:05:18.997]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:05:19.457 --> 00:05:22.558]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:27.442]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:31.746]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:34.689]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:39.453]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:42.917]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:58.166]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:05:58.406 --> 00:05:59.707]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:05:59.947 --> 00:06:01.948]  We will prevail if you take action and I know
[00:06:15.743 --> 00:06:22.365]  It's Showtime!
[00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:26.047]  The 8th day of July, 2018.
[00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:27.627]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:57.178 --> 00:07:01.625]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones.
[00:07:01.765 --> 00:07:03.347]  Move, bitch!
[00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:04.589]  Get out the way!
[00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:12.582]  One flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:07:12.702 --> 00:07:17.025]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:20.467]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:07:20.487 --> 00:07:22.028]  I will not let you down.
[00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:24.510]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.691]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.853]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:07:28.933 --> 00:07:34.376]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[00:07:34.637 --> 00:07:36.658]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:37.198 --> 00:07:38.199]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:41.341]  Well, Hillary is looking to run again in 2020.
[00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.442]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:47.565]  Trump is set to announce a Supreme Court pick very, very quickly ahead of the midterms.
[00:07:47.885 --> 00:07:53.309]  We've got the cave-in and the whole situation with the floods in Thailand and what's unfolding there.
[00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:56.211]  And China is saying they're basically already at war with the U.S.
[00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:57.152]  It's all coming up.
[00:07:57.512 --> 00:08:03.396]  But first, Trump's got Mueller in his sights for covering up 9-11.
[00:08:03.656 --> 00:08:04.757]  Here's a breakdown of it all.
[00:08:05.506 --> 00:08:07.689]  Almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.812]  It just pancaked.
[00:08:10.052 --> 00:08:14.558]  Well, when I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[00:08:15.299 --> 00:08:19.344]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[00:08:19.444 --> 00:08:22.267]  I think, you know, if you ever looked there, they were quite narrow.
[00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:24.849]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:33.293]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through the steel?
[00:08:33.914 --> 00:08:42.198]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[00:08:42.338 --> 00:09:00.286]  In the case of the FBI's involvement immediately post 9-11, there were these chartered flights by Saudi royals and members of the Bin Laden family that left places like Las Vegas, where they were holed up in some of their hotels waiting for the dust to settle.
[00:09:00.927 --> 00:09:09.530]  There are these, a plane load, literally, of Saudis and other folks associated with the Bin Laden family that left on this chartered flight.
[00:09:11.627 --> 00:09:28.173]  As someone who's actually done legal traveler debriefings and even talking to folks who have been refugees or emigres from other countries, those Saudis are precisely the sort of people who should have been debriefed at length
[00:09:28.853 --> 00:09:37.880]  By the FBI and frankly other intelligence services as well to build that network and to outline who knew who and what the associations were.
[00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:41.283]  Absolutely critical immediately following 9-11.
[00:09:41.963 --> 00:09:43.164]  And so was that done?
[00:09:43.925 --> 00:09:45.106]  The answer is no.
[00:09:45.706 --> 00:09:52.411]  And so this kid glove treatment was given and I hang that directly around the neck of Mr. Mueller.
[00:09:52.431 --> 00:09:55.554]  That's a really a disgraceful
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:09.524]  The government wants to be in charge.
[00:10:09.584 --> 00:10:13.287]  I mean, when Reagan said we're a country with a government, I think we're now a government with a country.
[00:10:14.088 --> 00:10:18.571]  And all of the things that are happening are only tightening that control on the people.
[00:10:18.591 --> 00:10:24.076]  They're going to manipulate them, and as long as they can keep them uninformed,
[00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:27.810]  And nobody realizes what's going on, or they don't see the threat.
[00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.212]  If they say, if you've done nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide.
[00:10:31.912 --> 00:10:34.233]  First of all, that's a great quote from Joseph Goebbels.
[00:10:34.993 --> 00:10:37.094]  And secondly, that's totally irrelevant.
[00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:44.177]  If we had had this program in place at the time, we would have been able to identify that particular telephone number in San Diego.
[00:10:44.237 --> 00:10:45.537]  I'm almost out of time.
[00:10:46.118 --> 00:10:52.140]  I understand, but I ask indulgence just to finish, because it's a critical point as to why we have this program and how important it is.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:52.700]  All right.
[00:10:55.161 --> 00:11:02.549]  The telephone number from Yemen, we would have matched it up to that telephone number in San Diego, got further legal process, identified Al-Midhar.
[00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:03.950]  One last point.
[00:11:05.011 --> 00:11:12.179]  The 9-11 Commission itself indicated that investigations or interrogations of Al-Midhar, once he was identified,
[00:11:13.766 --> 00:11:19.152]  Could have evidence of connections to other participants in the 9-11 plot.
[00:11:19.192 --> 00:11:21.675]  The simple fact of their detention could have derailed the plan.
[00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:24.759]  In any case, the opportunity was not there.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.464]  If we had had this program, that opportunity would have been there.
[00:11:28.524 --> 00:11:30.584]  Who is Special Counsel Robert Mueller?
[00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:35.706]  Is he the upstanding career law enforcement officer as the establishment would lead you to believe?
[00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:42.547]  Or is Robert Mueller a dirty fix-it man for the corrupt authoritarians lurking behind the DC power structure?
[00:11:43.227 --> 00:11:56.090]  After well over a year now of enduring the tainting of the executive office with a DNC-funded bogus investigation, President Trump is revisiting concerns he made about 9-11 during his candidacy.
[00:11:56.952 --> 00:12:01.695]  Obviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake, alright?
[00:12:02.235 --> 00:12:19.846]  Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took Jeb Bush, if you remember, at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced the President, it took him five days, he went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a mistake, it took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, it was a mistake.
[00:12:20.487 --> 00:12:24.309]  The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that.
[00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:28.820]  I just had the gall to go after my mother.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.662]  Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago and looked up and I saw my mom.
[00:12:33.702 --> 00:12:35.443]  My mom is the strongest woman I know.
[00:12:35.643 --> 00:12:36.424]  She should be running.
[00:12:36.544 --> 00:12:43.087]  Trump wants the deep state to know that the gloves are off, he's going to war, he was always going to release this later on you anyways.
[00:12:43.487 --> 00:12:47.069]  Bush's, Clinton's, criminal elements, the CIA, all of you.
[00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:51.987]  This is just the beginning with Mueller's cover-up.
[00:12:52.107 --> 00:12:55.810]  This is the piece of string on the sweater that pulls the whole sweater apart.
[00:12:56.211 --> 00:12:56.751]  It's the beginning.
[00:12:57.171 --> 00:13:02.916]  It was Mueller that signed off on hindering the investigations launched by the families of victims of 9-11.
[00:13:03.857 --> 00:13:14.506]  Huge body of evidence that Saudi government officials prepared for the hijackers' arrival, helped them, got them money, English lessons... That's right.
[00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:16.488]  Mueller and the FBI helped them.
[00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:20.010]  They didn't need more surveillance.
[00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:20.670]  They protected them.
[00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.692]  By the way, Trump's looking at letting the FBI go public.
[00:13:23.712 --> 00:13:23.972]  Oh, yeah.
[00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:40.342]  Interrogations were shut down.
[00:13:40.923 --> 00:13:43.385]  Documents have been kept secret.
[00:13:43.726 --> 00:13:53.838]  And the reason we are here, and our plea, the family's plea to President Trump, is to declassify the documents.
[00:13:54.518 --> 00:13:58.083]  People need to know more about Mr. Mueller.
[00:13:58.143 --> 00:14:04.331]  He is not the white knight that Lindsey Graham and others in the mainstream media have portrayed.
[00:14:04.832 --> 00:14:11.160]  His role during and after the 9-11 matter needs to be examined.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:16.806]  It was Mueller that acted as a counter-crime boss during the Whitey Bulger court drama.
[00:14:17.146 --> 00:14:28.358]  And Mueller, just like Whitey Bulger, could kill whoever he wanted, killed reportedly over 100 people, run mafia operations in Boston, assassinate members of other mafias the FBI wanted taken out.
[00:14:28.758 --> 00:14:33.023]  The FBI was operating as a gang in Boston.
[00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:42.294]  Albert Fitzpatrick is seen here leaving federal court this afternoon after changing his plea to guilty on a 12-count indictment for perjury and obstruction of justice.
[00:14:42.894 --> 00:14:53.207]  The former assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, who was in charge of the organized crime program, testified for the defense three years ago in the trial of James Whitey Bulger.
[00:14:53.787 --> 00:14:58.190]  At the time, Fitzpatrick made at least six false claims on the witness stand.
[00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:10.878]  It was Mueller that allowed pedo Jeffrey Epstein to serve minimum sentencing for overseeing a sex exploitation ring of underage females that should have easily implicated several high-profile individuals.
[00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:16.762]  Instead, the FBI worked to deal with Epstein as an informant and then buried the investigation.
[00:15:17.242 --> 00:15:26.465]  And wouldn't it be interesting if it's none other than Mueller now conjuring up dirt on one of his toughest critics, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan.
[00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:33.186]  News story from NBCNews.com about some allegations involving Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio.
[00:15:33.526 --> 00:15:40.868]  Three former wrestlers at Ohio State University are accusing him of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse when he was a coach at the school.
[00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:46.350]  That he turned a blind eye to sexual abuse while working as a wrestling coach at Ohio State University.
[00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.692]  You've seen the reports in recent days.
[00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:51.213]  Your reaction first to all of this?
[00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:51.994]  It's false.
[00:15:52.014 --> 00:15:56.677]  I mean, I never saw, never heard of, never was told about any type of abuse.
[00:15:56.737 --> 00:15:59.559]  John Bowne reporting for Infowars.com.
[00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:02.181]  Meanwhile, Mueller ran the aircraft with the kidnapped children.
[00:16:04.847 --> 00:16:23.136]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:23.237 --> 00:16:29.180]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.220]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.482]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:34.122 --> 00:16:35.102]  And so much more.
[00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:36.803]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:37.023 --> 00:16:38.723]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:44.444]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:45.745]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:45.765 --> 00:16:47.705]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:47.785 --> 00:16:50.166]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:50.366 --> 00:16:51.646]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:51.806 --> 00:16:53.626]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:54.166 --> 00:16:54.787]  Immune Wall.

[00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:07.009]  Go ahead.
[00:17:07.249 --> 00:17:12.832]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram, and I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:14.132]  I'd done the War Room.
[00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:16.893]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[00:17:16.913 --> 00:17:18.474]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[00:17:18.514 --> 00:17:19.135]  I was exhausted.
[00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:22.736]  I popped two Brain Force Plus, and I was good as new.
[00:17:23.076 --> 00:17:27.699]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilized, mentally energizing.
[00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:29.660]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.380]  The same thing.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.621]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at Infowars.
[00:17:32.721 --> 00:17:33.962]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[00:17:34.122 --> 00:17:36.204]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[00:17:36.224 --> 00:17:42.228]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling, you know?
[00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:43.289]  You can sleep with it.
[00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:47.992]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[00:17:48.032 --> 00:17:50.834]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:52.675]  This is the best combination I have found.
[00:17:52.715 --> 00:17:53.515]  It really works.
[00:17:53.735 --> 00:17:58.258]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:00.900]  Believe me.
[00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:05.161]  This 4th of July is special.
[00:18:05.181 --> 00:18:06.661]  Everybody can see it, they can feel it.
[00:18:07.182 --> 00:18:11.343]  The globalists are attempting to kill a worldwide awakening to their tyranny.
[00:18:11.623 --> 00:18:15.264]  And America, yet again, is at the heart of the resistance of the globalists.
[00:18:15.984 --> 00:18:21.045]  That's why this 4th of July I'm asking all of our great supporters to think about Infowars now more than ever.
[00:18:21.085 --> 00:18:24.826]  And what would the world be like if Infowars wasn't there resisting the globalists?
[00:18:25.686 --> 00:18:27.548]  What would have happened if you hadn't supported InfoWars?
[00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:29.851]  We would not be having the victories we have today.
[00:18:29.931 --> 00:18:33.034]  So yes, a lot of good things are happening, but the enemy is striking back.
[00:18:33.074 --> 00:18:39.762]  So please, think about InfoWars and funding our operation while you get great products at the same time on the 4th of July that's so historic.

[00:20:06.319 --> 00:20:08.942]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.896 --> 00:20:39.357]  Killing yourself to live.
[00:20:39.377 --> 00:20:45.080]  That's globalism.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:45.981]  That's what it's all about.
[00:20:46.181 --> 00:20:48.803]  Anti-human, anti-prosperity, anti-future.
[00:20:49.603 --> 00:20:51.704]  Absolutely draconian and dystopian.
[00:20:51.724 --> 00:20:52.325]  We oppose it.
[00:20:53.618 --> 00:20:56.560]  All right, coming up, is Hillary Clinton secretly planning to run in 2020?
[00:20:57.961 --> 00:21:00.283]  That's just two years away.
[00:21:00.323 --> 00:21:01.664]  We're going to look at that coming up.
[00:21:02.324 --> 00:21:04.386]  Announcement of Trump's Supreme Court choice nears.
[00:21:04.506 --> 00:21:06.187]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:09.730]  Inside Pompeo's fraught North Korea visit.
[00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.652]  Lifelong Democrat lawmaker vows to support Trump.
[00:21:13.573 --> 00:21:17.836]  Only Republicans until Dems return to sanity and
[00:21:19.082 --> 00:21:43.154]  Honesty, the whole hashtag JustWalkAway movement gains steam and I believe it's a real movement because I see it on the ground where Democrats come up to me, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, Asian, you name it, and they say, I used to be a Democrat, but I can see the corruption, I can see the anti-Americanism, I can see the anti-free speech, these people are crazy, I'm a Republican now.
[00:21:43.234 --> 00:21:45.836]  Well, I was never a Republican or a Democrat, but
[00:21:46.656 --> 00:21:48.958]  We've taken over the Republican Party, at least partially.
[00:21:49.318 --> 00:21:50.339]  Kicked the bluebloods out.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.562]  But the Democrats, you've got something even worse.
[00:21:53.642 --> 00:21:56.484]  So, yes, we're trying to make America great again right now.
[00:21:57.025 --> 00:21:58.526]  It's very, very, very exciting.
[00:21:58.566 --> 00:22:10.276]  Now, that said, if you just tuned in, I played a compilation of the news reports about the incredible corruption of the special counsel,
[00:22:11.641 --> 00:22:14.704]  Appointed by the president, Mr. Rosenstein.
[00:22:15.404 --> 00:22:18.327]  The president doesn't matter, we elected the real president, Rosenstein.
[00:22:19.048 --> 00:22:22.491]  And then his puppet that follows his orders, Jeff Sessions.
[00:22:24.492 --> 00:22:24.813]  And so...
[00:22:26.223 --> 00:22:32.928]  They're coming out saying all this dirt's coming out, all this proof of Russia gay, all this corruption, blah blah blah, but of course none of it's ever there.
[00:22:33.249 --> 00:22:46.159]  Meanwhile, we have them all caught red-handed in their own texts, their own messages, their own payments, Hillary giving McCabe's wife a half million, wives of husbands of the FBI creating the fake pissgate dossier, getting millions.
[00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:47.239]  It is incredible.
[00:22:47.259 --> 00:22:51.263]  And you've got Giuliani and others coming out saying,
[00:22:52.284 --> 00:22:55.645]  That Mueller is leading the most corrupt investigation he's ever seen.
[00:22:56.225 --> 00:22:59.986]  Well, there might have been corrupt investigations before, but this is the most transparent.
[00:23:01.506 --> 00:23:05.267]  The most out-the-open corruption, because what do they think's going to happen?
[00:23:06.008 --> 00:23:14.330]  Anybody who can rub two brain cells together knows this is political, and knows it's a fraud, and knows that Trump's not in bed with the Russians, and is pro-America.
[00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.370]  So where do they go after this?
[00:23:17.851 --> 00:23:19.271]  We'll talk about it, but first, here's a clip.
[00:23:20.316 --> 00:23:25.661]  The reality is that there are biases that have to be explored surrounding Mueller.
[00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:33.948]  How you could end up hiring a group of people that are as prejudiced and biased as this group, in their record at least, is extraordinary.
[00:23:34.369 --> 00:23:36.270]  And then how you can expect us to just work our...
[00:23:37.231 --> 00:23:39.412]  Our client is like a lamb going to the slaughter.
[00:23:39.952 --> 00:23:42.073]  We wouldn't be lawyers if we were doing that.
[00:23:42.113 --> 00:23:43.453]  George, he wants to testify.
[00:23:44.454 --> 00:23:46.434]  It's hard to believe that anymore, Mr. Mayor.
[00:23:46.635 --> 00:23:50.996]  Well, it is hard to believe given all the things that have been shown about how tainted this investigation is.
[00:23:51.276 --> 00:23:56.018]  This is the most corrupt investigation I have ever seen that the Justice Department is allowing to go forward.
[00:23:56.258 --> 00:24:00.740]  I've never seen an investigation with text from FBI agents, now seven of them.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.582]  That have such extraordinary bias against the person who predated Robert Mueller.
[00:24:05.942 --> 00:24:09.404]  Well, that's the investigation he inherited with a lot of the testimony that he inherited.
[00:24:09.664 --> 00:24:12.305]  And then he went ahead and didn't do anything to purge himself of that.
[00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:12.885]  He fired him.
[00:24:13.225 --> 00:24:15.126]  He fired him after somebody else found out.
[00:24:15.586 --> 00:24:18.348]  Well, how about looking at the texts of all of his people?
[00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:24.731]  Does his number two guy, his number three guy, his number four guy have similar texts in which they're talking about how much they hate Trump?
[00:24:24.751 --> 00:24:25.211]  I don't know.
[00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:33.508]  And you've got Stephanopoulos, the operative of the Clintons, sitting there acting like he's all impartial.
[00:24:34.229 --> 00:24:39.433]  Robert Mueller and that whole operation continued on what the Justice Department had set up.
[00:24:41.755 --> 00:24:42.816]  And they were continuing.
[00:24:43.973 --> 00:24:49.655]  What had been set up to stop Trump during the campaign to cover their ass because now their job is twofold.
[00:24:49.675 --> 00:24:56.218]  Not just try to keep Trump from getting in office or keep Trump from getting elected before that or kick Trump out of office later.
[00:24:56.898 --> 00:25:01.480]  It was cover up Spygate and make Spygate Russiagate.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:12.424]  That they had thought that Hillary would win and that they could then try to cover that up by a new investigation used as a smokescreen.
[00:25:13.331 --> 00:25:21.713]  So here's Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, breaking that down, saying Mueller needs to provide factual basis to interview the president.
[00:25:22.613 --> 00:25:25.114]  I've told you for over a year he shouldn't talk to Mueller.
[00:25:25.734 --> 00:25:27.235]  He shouldn't talk to any of these crooks.
[00:25:27.275 --> 00:25:27.775]  They're jokes.
[00:25:28.115 --> 00:25:29.255]  He could fire all of them.
[00:25:29.275 --> 00:25:30.255]  It's the executive branch.
[00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:34.076]  But they created this idea in the media that, oh, you don't follow Mueller.
[00:25:34.116 --> 00:25:35.077]  He's our president.
[00:25:35.637 --> 00:25:36.477]  We elected him.
[00:25:37.659 --> 00:25:44.145]  And the President's probably intelligently just left him there letting him rot, but they get more and more and more desperate.
[00:25:44.525 --> 00:25:46.387]  So here's the President's lawyer.
[00:25:47.362 --> 00:25:57.132]  Well, you had said that the 4th of July was basically a deadline of sorts for you to determine whether or not you would recommend President Trump sit down with Robert Mueller.
[00:25:57.492 --> 00:25:59.774]  It is now past the 4th of July.
[00:25:59.834 --> 00:26:00.495]  Where do we stand?
[00:26:01.656 --> 00:26:07.441]  Well, I think we're pretty much decided where we are and we await the decision of the Independent Counsel.
[00:26:08.923 --> 00:26:11.165]  We would not recommend an interview for the President.
[00:26:11.305 --> 00:26:18.392]  Unless they can satisfy us that there's some basis for this investigation.
[00:26:18.552 --> 00:26:22.996]  It's our firm belief, and we think nothing contradicts this, that the President did nothing wrong.
[00:26:24.237 --> 00:26:31.964]  In all the leaking that's gone on, there's been no leak of any fact that says the President conspired with anybody in Russia.
[00:26:32.785 --> 00:26:37.567]  I know from having been on the campaign that there was no contact with Russians, no discussion with Russians.
[00:26:38.387 --> 00:26:39.708]  So we've got to see something.
[00:26:39.728 --> 00:26:42.069]  I mean, something started this investigation.
[00:26:42.129 --> 00:26:46.290]  I don't just investigate my next-door neighbor because I think he may be committing a crime.
[00:26:46.791 --> 00:26:52.393]  I've got to, in order to get an investigation going, I've got to give the police or the FBI some kind of probable cause.
[00:26:53.173 --> 00:26:53.893]  And there isn't any.
[00:26:54.414 --> 00:26:59.556]  And when we've asked them for it, going back to John Dowd, they've given us nothing.
[00:27:00.453 --> 00:27:11.106]  And I think you can see John's opinion now is very much like ours, that the president shouldn't be interviewed because John has unfortunately come to the conclusion that this is a witch hunt and an attempt to trap him in perjury.
[00:27:11.226 --> 00:27:17.274]  We just had, I just, when I previewed our, introduced our segment, we had the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:27:18.154 --> 00:27:20.055]  They've come out with their first conclusion.
[00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:21.917]  They've got more to come when it comes to collusion.
[00:27:21.957 --> 00:27:24.478]  They haven't made a determinant on the collusion aspect of things.
[00:27:25.058 --> 00:27:30.242]  But it's a fact, in their minds, that Russia interfered and attempted to help the President.
[00:27:30.742 --> 00:27:36.085]  How is that not a compelling enough reason for Mr. Mueller to want to question the President?
[00:27:37.226 --> 00:27:40.228]  Well, because there's no evidence that links the President to that.
[00:27:40.248 --> 00:27:44.490]  I mean, that's a heck of a thing to... People can have all kinds of motives.
[00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:48.455]  You've got 170 plus countries.
[00:27:49.156 --> 00:27:53.363]  During any big campaign, there's all sorts of companies and bots and internet companies you can hire to do stuff.
[00:27:53.663 --> 00:27:55.807]  Turn out 80% of the bots out of Russia were for Hillary.
[00:27:56.328 --> 00:27:57.810]  So again, that's a red herring too, but...
[00:27:59.451 --> 00:28:08.273]  You've got Chuck Todd, the Democratic Party operative, the butt boy of Obama, up there, going, well, Mueller says this, well, Mueller said that.
[00:28:09.073 --> 00:28:10.934]  They don't like the election of Trump.
[00:28:11.674 --> 00:28:15.955]  These people sold us out to Russia with Uranium One and Communist China.
[00:28:16.315 --> 00:28:18.576]  Trump's America first, and you can see the country coming back.
[00:28:19.216 --> 00:28:21.836]  And that's the big problem they've got, is the country's coming back.
[00:28:22.256 --> 00:28:24.417]  People know the truth, and that's why they're so angry.
[00:28:25.219 --> 00:28:26.221]  That's why they're so upset.
[00:28:26.261 --> 00:28:27.324]  That's why they don't know what to do.
[00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:29.789]  Because these are the anti-Americans.
[00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:35.401]  They're the guys on tape saying, fly over country, we hate gun owners, we hate Christians, all this crap.
[00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.152]  And all these Democratic Party people they've got running for office that, like, are running against white people.
[00:28:41.993 --> 00:28:43.593]  It's the opposite of Martin Luther King.
[00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:44.834]  It's incredible.
[00:28:44.914 --> 00:28:46.155]  So, wow.
[00:28:46.455 --> 00:28:48.296]  Okay, when we come back, China.
[00:28:48.676 --> 00:28:51.077]  You know, a billion, quarter million people.
[00:28:51.657 --> 00:28:54.158]  They say they're already at war with the U.S.
[00:28:54.238 --> 00:28:54.959]  And they love Hillary.
[00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:56.259]  They love Chuck Todd.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.200]  And they hate you.
[00:29:02.722 --> 00:29:06.384]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.

[00:30:26.254 --> 00:30:35.881]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.
[00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:53.686]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.

[00:31:32.664 --> 00:31:33.904]  We are not victims.
[00:31:34.084 --> 00:31:35.325]  We are victorious.
[00:31:35.665 --> 00:31:40.627]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[00:31:40.707 --> 00:31:45.369]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.
[00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.778]  Again, InfoWars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules.

[00:32:01.923 --> 00:32:07.189]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.

[00:32:12.074 --> 00:32:18.341]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[00:32:20.103 --> 00:32:26.424]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.

[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.902]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.993 --> 00:33:18.914]  We are on the march.
[00:33:18.934 --> 00:33:20.295]  The Empire is on the run.
[00:33:20.395 --> 00:33:23.257]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:23.357 --> 00:33:26.459]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you I'm your man.
[00:33:26.519 --> 00:33:33.765]  You win some, lose some, if you'll listen to me.
[00:33:33.985 --> 00:33:41.991]  The pressure is to play.
[00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:45.333]  Ain't no difference what you say.
[00:33:56.092 --> 00:33:57.496]  We are drugged out!
[00:33:58.178 --> 00:34:00.424]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:34:01.585 --> 00:34:03.826]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:34:04.386 --> 00:34:05.927]  Today it all changes.
[00:34:06.247 --> 00:34:08.769]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:34:09.009 --> 00:34:09.789]  It is a choice.
[00:34:10.029 --> 00:34:11.850]  Just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:16.553]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[00:34:16.813 --> 00:34:19.454]  So we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:34:19.494 --> 00:34:21.975]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:34:22.316 --> 00:34:24.276]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:34:24.757 --> 00:34:26.197]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:34:26.398 --> 00:34:27.278]  We have the resources.
[00:34:31.104 --> 00:34:34.327]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:34:34.347 --> 00:34:35.808]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:34:35.828 --> 00:34:37.509]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:34:37.549 --> 00:34:38.430]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:39.531]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:41.913]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:34:42.093 --> 00:34:45.736]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:34:47.257 --> 00:34:50.820]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:53.141]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:35:02.068 --> 00:35:27.974]  It's totally insane that Hillary Clinton is still sending out emails to her constituents, to her zombie-like supporters, implying that she's the leader of the Democratic Party, and that she might even run, coming up in about the next year, because that's when the campaign starts, it's about two years out, year and a half out, that she might even run for president against Trump again.
[00:35:30.453 --> 00:35:32.174]  Then I pull back and I go, wait a minute.
[00:35:33.475 --> 00:35:42.462]  She ran before when she had a brain tumor, when she'd been in the hospital for a year, when she was having convulsions all the time.
[00:35:43.163 --> 00:35:45.104]  You were told about the Secret Service of the RNC.
[00:35:46.365 --> 00:35:47.126]  Just follow her.
[00:35:47.166 --> 00:35:48.287]  She's got a black ambulance.
[00:35:48.767 --> 00:35:52.810]  She's having convulsions every 45 minutes when she's down on her drugs.
[00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:55.752]  They got to take her off the drugs so she can even talk.
[00:35:58.375 --> 00:35:59.776]  But then, because she's off,
[00:36:00.816 --> 00:36:06.583]  The drugs that suppress your neurons, that suppress brain activity, she then has the convulsions.
[00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:12.490]  And she can either take a bunch of pills or drink a bottle of whiskey and not have convulsions, but then she's not on.
[00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.993]  So to be on, she's gotta get sober.
[00:36:15.954 --> 00:36:16.995]  Imagine the hell of that.
[00:36:17.095 --> 00:36:19.438]  She gets sober a few hours a day.
[00:36:20.179 --> 00:36:21.120]  They roll her out.
[00:36:23.729 --> 00:36:25.730]  They've got to have emergency tents all around her.
[00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:32.592]  We caught her, Millie Weaver caught her getting rushed into an emergency tent two weeks before she collapsed in New York.
[00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:37.634]  And you look at her emails, the New York Post reports on it.
[00:36:39.294 --> 00:36:42.656]  She's telling her constituents she's the leader of the Democratic Party.
[00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:46.717]  I guess at close seconds, Maxine Waters and
[00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:51.192]  That lunatic Nancy Pelosi?
[00:36:51.653 --> 00:37:04.624]  Nothing against women, I'd love to have a woman president, but she's got to be pro-America, pro-free market, not these crazy, entitled, never had a free market job, run around trying to create culture war, sex war, race war.
[00:37:05.104 --> 00:37:05.965]  Good God!
[00:37:07.066 --> 00:37:08.627]  It just boggles the mind.
[00:37:11.209 --> 00:37:16.794]  But you say, well that's crazy, she'd never run, everybody hates her, she's been rejected.
[00:37:19.306 --> 00:37:21.607]  She was co-governor in Arkansas.
[00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:24.869]  She was co-president with Bill Clinton for eight years.
[00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.732]  Under Obama, they admitted that she was basically co-president, running the State Department.
[00:37:29.752 --> 00:37:33.153]  That's just as important as the presidency itself, if the president isn't involved.
[00:37:35.034 --> 00:37:37.876]  So she was in four terms.
[00:37:40.537 --> 00:37:41.878]  You ever heard of anybody?
[00:37:42.658 --> 00:37:44.159]  Not even Roosevelt.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.161]  Well, he died at the beginning of his fourth term.
[00:37:49.172 --> 00:37:50.153]  Or was it the end of a third?
[00:37:50.193 --> 00:37:50.553]  I forget.
[00:37:50.693 --> 00:37:51.314]  Can we look that up?
[00:37:52.375 --> 00:37:53.916]  How many terms did Roosevelt serve?
[00:37:53.936 --> 00:37:56.818]  I think he died at the end of the third, but he'd won a fourth.
[00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:06.887]  So, Hillary has served more terms as deputy president, or co-president is the word.
[00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:12.752]  Even the Washington Post admits it.
[00:38:12.832 --> 00:38:13.933]  Look at that.
[00:38:16.914 --> 00:38:18.335]  So it just never ends.
[00:38:19.496 --> 00:38:27.021]  And you said to yourself, this crazy woman, this corrupt person that her own party doesn't like, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:27.942]  She still runs it.
[00:38:27.982 --> 00:38:29.163]  She's got that foundation.
[00:38:29.803 --> 00:38:31.344]  With the billions of dollars she's milked.
[00:38:33.085 --> 00:38:34.326]  There it is, CNN reporting.
[00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:35.307]  Another run.
[00:38:35.327 --> 00:38:36.828]  Hillary Clinton tries again.
[00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.429]  God.
[00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:41.651]  We are going to take back the country.
[00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.493]  We love Hillary Clinton.
[00:38:44.053 --> 00:38:46.515]  This woman in tapes that have been linked.
[00:38:48.319 --> 00:38:49.960]  That have been leaked out hates America.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.062]  So you got to ask yourself, where is the end of this?
[00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:59.685]  I'm going to open the phones up to talk about this and other big issues.
[00:39:00.506 --> 00:39:04.968]  The toll free number to join us on any issue you want to discuss, but I just want you to be first time callers.
[00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:07.710]  Please be honest about that and have a good telephone.
[00:39:08.644 --> 00:39:11.366]  I want to talk to you.
[00:39:11.726 --> 00:39:16.530]  I'd really love you to call 877-789-ALEX.
[00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:16.930]  877-789-2539.
[00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:17.691]  877-789-2539.
[00:39:18.371 --> 00:39:20.773]  And we'll talk about that.
[00:39:20.873 --> 00:39:23.415]  We'll talk about the Democrats announcing civil war.
[00:39:23.976 --> 00:39:31.841]  And then, you know, Rob Reiner, Michael Moore, Bill Maher, all of them.
[00:39:31.921 --> 00:39:33.783]  And then I go, oh look, they say we're in a civil war.
[00:39:34.043 --> 00:39:35.104]  You crazy person!
[00:39:35.284 --> 00:39:37.786]  There's no civil war, you crazy right-wing son of a bastard!
[00:39:42.981 --> 00:39:43.261]  Okay.
[00:39:44.542 --> 00:39:45.382]  We're going to discuss that.
[00:39:45.422 --> 00:39:50.384]  We're going to discuss all of it at 877-789-2539.
[00:39:50.424 --> 00:39:54.625]  But I know we're taking control of our government again.
[00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:57.586]  I know we're taking control of our republic again.
[00:39:58.747 --> 00:39:59.887]  And that's what's exciting to me.
[00:39:59.927 --> 00:40:01.948]  Now, this subject is really big.
[00:40:03.388 --> 00:40:07.370]  And I don't say this to be dramatic, because I know the White House and the President
[00:40:08.513 --> 00:40:15.957]  Are quietly trying to fix this because they don't want to rattle confidence and they don't want to sound too extreme because reality is so extreme.
[00:40:17.839 --> 00:40:24.863]  But in my own concern, I've reached out to some folks and said, should I say all this?
[00:40:24.883 --> 00:40:29.245]  Because it's what I really think, but I don't want to like rattle the confidence in the country.
[00:40:29.966 --> 00:40:33.208]  And I don't hold back on stuff, but I don't want to really go with my hardcore info.
[00:40:33.628 --> 00:40:35.889]  And I've been told by a lot of folks, they go, no, you're dead on.
[00:40:36.329 --> 00:40:36.890]  Fire at will.
[00:40:38.733 --> 00:40:40.875]  And people are like, oh my god, you're this government shill.
[00:40:40.915 --> 00:40:42.076]  You've always been against the government.
[00:40:42.336 --> 00:40:43.997]  Because our government was run by foreign banks.
[00:40:44.538 --> 00:40:45.799]  We see a beachhead.
[00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:48.921]  Our government partially controlled by American patriots now.
[00:40:49.422 --> 00:40:55.306]  So I'm proud to say that I'm reaching out to smart people and trying to coordinate somehow.
[00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.448]  Hell, you know the Democrats are coordinating.
[00:41:01.485 --> 00:41:11.631]  And I've said, listen, I can see the Office of Personnel Management hack, our entire government database, all our operatives overseas, domestically, their families, our codes, our shields, everything.
[00:41:12.071 --> 00:41:12.471]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:12.491 --> 00:41:13.092]  It was done on purpose.
[00:41:13.932 --> 00:41:16.494]  I see the industrial selling of everything, which they admit is on purpose.
[00:41:16.514 --> 00:41:17.915]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:41:18.435 --> 00:41:19.075]  I see it all.
[00:41:20.296 --> 00:41:21.757]  What do we do to turn this around?
[00:41:22.898 --> 00:41:25.079]  And the answer I get back is, well, what do you think we do?
[00:41:28.376 --> 00:41:31.706]  I mean, I think we have to admit how far we've slid.
[00:41:32.609 --> 00:41:34.836]  And I think it's really the Achilles heel of the globalist.
[00:41:35.558 --> 00:41:44.281]  That if we just detail how we got infiltrated and what happened, and turn it around, people will listen and take action.
[00:41:44.841 --> 00:41:45.582]  Because it's the truth!
[00:41:45.842 --> 00:41:47.842]  And, you know, I'm not Machiavelli, man.
[00:41:49.103 --> 00:41:52.044]  I can see into Machiavelli systems, but I'm a straight shooter.
[00:41:52.644 --> 00:41:54.385]  I've always found that's what feels good in my gut.
[00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.185]  It's what works.
[00:41:56.286 --> 00:41:56.926]  It's just who I am.
[00:41:56.946 --> 00:41:58.846]  You know, they think I'm a schmuck because I'm a straight shooter.
[00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:00.027]  You know what?
[00:42:02.904 --> 00:42:06.546]  Straight shooting is the fourth, fifth dimensional chess everybody talks about.
[00:42:06.566 --> 00:42:08.927]  Everybody just keeps thinking being a BSer works.
[00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:14.009]  Only when you've got an honorable society that trusts a few traitors and doesn't know they're against them.
[00:42:14.269 --> 00:42:16.710]  Just because cancer spreads through the body doesn't mean it's dominant.
[00:42:18.311 --> 00:42:21.412]  Just because you guys cheat doesn't mean like, oh, we must all do that.
[00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:24.233]  No, that's how you collapse a civilization.
[00:42:24.293 --> 00:42:25.374]  It's how you collapse a planet.
[00:42:26.855 --> 00:42:27.555]  So when we come back,
[00:42:29.232 --> 00:42:36.220]  I'm going to lay out the facts here, just as best as I can tell you about what we face, who our enemies are, and what we're up against.
[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:36.600]  It's bad.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.283]  I mean, we are way behind, actually.
[00:42:39.783 --> 00:42:44.569]  The fact that you think Trump's in there and everything, and the way everybody's against Trump.
[00:42:46.004 --> 00:42:46.945]  Who are these followers?
[00:42:47.465 --> 00:42:49.247]  God, they ought to be praying Trump succeeds.
[00:42:49.807 --> 00:42:54.971]  They're just such pathetic followers, though, and it's not the followers' fault that they did this.
[00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:58.413]  It's our fault as leaders that we didn't see the problem and face it.
[00:42:58.673 --> 00:42:59.294]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:59.314 --> 00:42:59.754]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.472 --> 00:43:08.477]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:43:08.858 --> 00:43:11.460]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:15.523]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:43:15.784 --> 00:43:20.047]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:43:20.488 --> 00:43:23.730]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:43:24.631 --> 00:43:34.855]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:43:35.616 --> 00:43:43.679]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:54.344]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:44:02.426 --> 00:44:05.629]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:07.390]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:44:07.871 --> 00:44:19.421]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:44:20.101 --> 00:44:25.206]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:44:25.606 --> 00:44:28.988]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:44:29.428 --> 00:44:35.252]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:44:35.472 --> 00:44:40.135]  A fast acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:44:40.656 --> 00:44:42.957]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:44:43.298 --> 00:44:44.638]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:44:45.039 --> 00:44:49.922]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:44:50.162 --> 00:44:54.645]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:44:54.745 --> 00:44:56.907]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:44:57.427 --> 00:45:02.291]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:45:03.303 --> 00:45:07.867]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:45:07.887 --> 00:45:08.387]  Thanks for holding.
[00:45:08.447 --> 00:45:09.368]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:45:09.868 --> 00:45:13.451]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:45:13.491 --> 00:45:22.238]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:45:22.358 --> 00:45:38.549]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your product since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:45:39.029 --> 00:45:47.555]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:45:47.615 --> 00:45:52.378]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:45:52.518 --> 00:45:59.402]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side-by-side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[00:46:02.504 --> 00:46:04.486]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:46:04.506 --> 00:46:04.846]  Go ahead.
[00:46:05.559 --> 00:46:07.400]  I just have to say something, man.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.382]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:46:11.262 --> 00:46:12.363]  It just gets old, man.
[00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:14.404]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:17.186]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:46:17.446 --> 00:46:21.448]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:46:21.468 --> 00:46:23.950]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.072]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:46:27.092 --> 00:46:28.552]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:46:28.793 --> 00:46:29.673]  Us being shut down?
[00:46:29.913 --> 00:46:30.954]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:46:31.374 --> 00:46:32.415]  You know what, Alex?
[00:46:32.455 --> 00:46:33.536]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[00:46:33.556 --> 00:46:34.376]  Hey, Frank!
[00:46:34.657 --> 00:46:40.021]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:46:40.341 --> 00:46:44.604]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:47.706]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:46:47.987 --> 00:46:48.367]  You understand?
[00:46:48.447 --> 00:46:49.708]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:46:50.088 --> 00:46:51.249]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:57.134]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[00:46:58.114 --> 00:46:58.795]  Do you understand?
[00:46:58.815 --> 00:46:59.996]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:47:05.965 --> 00:47:08.552]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:42.188 --> 00:47:45.870]  Well, Hillary Clinton is sending out feelers to her supporters via email.
[00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:47.050]  The New York Post is reporting it.
[00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.451]  Considering and testing a 2020 run.
[00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:50.852]  Well, of course she is.
[00:47:50.932 --> 00:47:59.516]  Even if she doesn't run, she wants to keep getting those campaign contributions, that money, into her corrupt money laundering operation known as her foundation.
[00:48:00.897 --> 00:48:02.277]  So it's totally sick.
[00:48:02.397 --> 00:48:08.180]  And it just shows how delusional and disconnected from reality the establishment is.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.622]  But if we buy into their hoax, well then it's our fault, isn't it?
[00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:16.752]  We're gonna start the next hour here in about 10 minutes and go to already loaded phone lines.
[00:48:16.812 --> 00:48:30.539]  I may even get to some during this segment, but if you just joined us... I remember back under the Clintons, how they were selling out our missile secrets for our intercontinental ballistic missiles to Communist China.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:37.803]  And I remember myself and Washington Times writers and others
[00:48:39.164 --> 00:48:40.066]  Drudge, you name it.
[00:48:40.206 --> 00:48:48.342]  We're reporting on the Clintons with communist Chinese generals in the White House and all of it, and the sellout by Laurel Hughes to them.
[00:48:49.517 --> 00:48:50.778]  With MIRV technology.
[00:48:51.118 --> 00:48:52.239]  That's the reentry device.
[00:48:52.539 --> 00:48:54.240]  It's one thing to put a missile up into orbit.
[00:48:54.801 --> 00:48:59.684]  Another thing to get it going a trajectory over from China over the North Pole to the U.S.
[00:49:00.084 --> 00:49:11.191]  But it's another thing to get it to come back into the atmosphere and have the nose cone pop open and have, you know, a dozen dummy warheads and maybe a dozen other real warheads so that when they try to shoot those down, they don't get them all.
[00:49:11.812 --> 00:49:13.333]  That's multiple reentry device.
[00:49:13.813 --> 00:49:14.554]  MIRV technology.
[00:49:14.914 --> 00:49:18.937]  So from the boost, the first stage boost, second stage boost,
[00:49:19.877 --> 00:49:26.220]  re-entry to Merv technology, the Clintonistas gave them everything.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:33.444]  Like they gave them our jobs, our businesses, our industry, our security codes, the Panama Canal, all the major deepwater ports.
[00:49:34.124 --> 00:49:37.846]  Hillary is a globalist operative put in there to do that.
[00:49:39.647 --> 00:49:40.728]  And then the media spun it.
[00:49:41.268 --> 00:49:44.270]  Are attacks on China anti-Asian?
[00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.571]  No, it's China.
[00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:55.444]  Under Mao that killed 84 million of their own people, according to the Chinese Communist, CIA says 65 million.
[00:49:55.604 --> 00:49:57.966]  It's their own system that sells political dissidents organs.
[00:49:58.806 --> 00:50:12.015]  So when you talk about a billion, 500 million people, genetically the same, but oppressed by the Communist elite, there's not the racism there, there's the classism of the party.
[00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:16.298]  Where there is no class, pun intended, under Communism.
[00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:32.763]  And so they're doing all this, and the Communist Chinese come out in Bloomberg and the Sunday Express, and I've got the articles right here, let's do a camera shot of that, saying we're already at war with the United States.
[00:50:33.789 --> 00:50:54.973]  We're already economically, you read the leaked memos that the PLA put out on purpose, and they say we've already got their industry, we've already got the rare earth minerals, 98%, we already got our military under these companies as front people in all these nations, we're ready to cut the US off economically, we're ready to foment economic warfare and cultural warfare inside America, and we're ready to bring the US down.
[00:50:56.393 --> 00:50:59.334]  And man, it's in the news that China now controls Hollywood,
[00:51:00.484 --> 00:51:07.987]  China has a $900 billion trade deficit with us, and Trump says a year ago, give us $50 billion.
[00:51:08.948 --> 00:51:10.428]  Did you show you have some sign?
[00:51:11.509 --> 00:51:13.990]  China, you're investing $24 billion a year in us.
[00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.431]  We invest $900 billion in you.
[00:51:17.131 --> 00:51:19.112]  I want to see some Chinese factories in the U.S.
[00:51:19.212 --> 00:51:19.912]  Show me something.
[00:51:20.492 --> 00:51:22.373]  Over a year ago, he met with them in Mar-a-Lago.
[00:51:23.273 --> 00:51:27.135]  And the communist Chinese dictator, he's a dictator, he wasn't elected by the people,
[00:51:29.824 --> 00:51:31.205]  He said, we're going to war with you.
[00:51:32.867 --> 00:51:42.396]  And we've built all these artificial islands and we'll invade the South China Sea and we'll take over all these different areas right where the Japanese did.
[00:51:44.217 --> 00:51:45.258]  Philippines, you name it.
[00:51:45.358 --> 00:51:47.520]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:51:48.061 --> 00:51:53.326]  And if you study geopolitical systems, everything done to America since
[00:51:55.219 --> 00:52:05.801]  The 70s, by the policy wonks, presidents are mainly puppets, until Trump came along, has been 100% strategically to shell the United States out.
[00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:08.222]  Yeah, there's the Guardian, dictator for life.
[00:52:08.822 --> 00:52:10.302]  They have debates about whether he's a dictator.
[00:52:10.742 --> 00:52:19.364]  The Politburo and the Central Committee vote, a couple hundred people that are all billionaire communists, and then they put the asshole in there, excuse me, delete that, delay that.
[00:52:20.084 --> 00:52:22.344]  I mean, he's beyond the name I just called him.
[00:52:23.565 --> 00:52:24.545]  He's a mass murderer.
[00:52:25.612 --> 00:52:27.715]  And he's taking China back to where Mao had it.
[00:52:29.397 --> 00:52:35.765]  So, you read this, US and China have bigger problems than trade war, Bloomberg, and it gets into the military war.
[00:52:36.516 --> 00:52:48.102]  China's military reforms to win a war, but you actually read the memo I read last Friday, and it says we're already winning, we've already encircled them, we already control their people, they're all divided, Americans are weak.
[00:52:48.563 --> 00:53:01.970]  So when you sit there and you see a Democrat, or you see a leftist that hates flyover country, or hates Christians, or hates Trump, Trump could be criticized for only asking China
[00:53:04.471 --> 00:53:07.212]  I hate to use a vulgar analogy, but when they work, you've got to use them.
[00:53:07.232 --> 00:53:08.212]  You know Full Metal Jacket?
[00:53:09.812 --> 00:53:16.574]  And you've got Sergeant Hartman talking to him, and he says, you're the type of guy that'll do something to the other guy and not even give him a reach around.
[00:53:17.374 --> 00:53:20.815]  I mean, all Trump did was ask for a reach around.
[00:53:22.475 --> 00:53:29.797]  And China said, no man, you're going to give us everything, dirtbag Americans, and you're going to get nothing back.
[00:53:30.977 --> 00:53:31.637]  That's Trump's like,
[00:53:33.519 --> 00:53:41.184]  Okay, there's a 290% tariff on all dairy to Canada for 30-something years?
[00:53:41.825 --> 00:53:42.585]  Hundreds of billions?
[00:53:44.066 --> 00:53:44.306]  No!
[00:53:44.987 --> 00:53:51.111]  And Canada's so used to us being on our back or on our knees, they start flipping out going, we got trannies!
[00:53:51.311 --> 00:53:52.292]  We're for gays!
[00:53:52.712 --> 00:53:54.653]  And Trump goes, okay, great, I understand that.
[00:53:56.034 --> 00:53:58.676]  What about the 200 plus percent tariff on dairy?
[00:54:00.814 --> 00:54:03.817]  And then our own media gangs up like Trump's bad.
[00:54:04.418 --> 00:54:05.159]  So let me explain.
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:13.568]  I go into a business deal, and you tell me you get everything, I get nothing, even though I hold all the cards.
[00:54:17.739 --> 00:54:18.680]  And that's the thing about Trump.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:20.682]  He's just not anti-American.
[00:54:21.182 --> 00:54:22.864]  Psychotically anti-American.
[00:54:23.345 --> 00:54:25.347]  How did we ever get an elite that did this?
[00:54:25.487 --> 00:54:27.449]  Because America had 55% of the wealth in 1952.
[00:54:27.509 --> 00:54:27.789]  Look it up.
[00:54:33.726 --> 00:54:37.168]  And these elites went, my God, we can parlay this into total control.
[00:54:37.568 --> 00:54:41.050]  But to get people to go along with it, we've got to create an anti-American ideology.
[00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:46.392]  We've got to get people to signal they're traitors and be anti-Americans so we can trust them to do this.
[00:54:46.412 --> 00:54:51.975]  Because, you know, you've got to really be a scumbag to want to bankrupt your granddaddy that's a farmer.
[00:54:53.595 --> 00:54:56.417]  Or to want to hurt steel workers in Cleveland.
[00:54:57.317 --> 00:55:02.900]  Or to just have a raging, you know what, to screw America.
[00:55:04.019 --> 00:55:18.070]  But that's what the colleges and the schools and it's just all like you know wow we we were so close and we're probably like a patient that kind of rallies in surgery but still dies.
[00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:23.114]  I've had family I've been there when they rally in a surgery and actually they come back for a day and then die right after.
[00:55:23.814 --> 00:55:24.375]  They rally.
[00:55:26.820 --> 00:55:27.420]  And then they die.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:33.181]  And I don't want to be a negative person here, but I'm not a cult member like Oprah Winfrey that's like, the secret is to be positive.
[00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:36.042]  I think America's rallying before its death.
[00:55:36.902 --> 00:55:37.562]  I'm just gonna be honest.
[00:55:37.802 --> 00:55:38.562]  I think we're gonna die.
[00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:41.303]  I think we're gonna implode and be totally poor, and I think it's all gonna be over.
[00:55:41.763 --> 00:55:42.483]  I think we're evil.
[00:55:42.523 --> 00:55:46.564]  We've aborted 50 million babies, and the average person doesn't want it.
[00:55:46.904 --> 00:55:51.205]  God is all about justice, and I don't think we deserve Trump.
[00:55:51.645 --> 00:55:53.546]  I don't think we deserve to turn the country around.
[00:55:53.566 --> 00:55:55.386]  I don't think we—because here's the thing.
[00:55:55.766 --> 00:55:59.128]  Those of us that are self-sufficient will be okay in a total collapse.
[00:55:59.308 --> 00:56:00.309]  It'll be rough, but we'll make it.
[00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.570]  Most of us.
[00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:07.413]  But what about all the scum and all the backstabbers and all the pedophiles?
[00:56:07.993 --> 00:56:09.614]  No, they are going to kill each other.
[00:56:10.435 --> 00:56:12.696]  So, I'm hoping we fix things.
[00:56:12.776 --> 00:56:13.517]  I'm working for it.
[00:56:13.877 --> 00:56:15.598]  But I'm not worried one bit.
[00:56:16.098 --> 00:56:17.159]  Because the type of people
[00:56:18.083 --> 00:56:21.444]  They want to suck on Hillary Clinton's wart-covered feet.
[00:56:22.285 --> 00:56:22.765]  Culturally.
[00:56:23.205 --> 00:56:24.206]  And want to do all this?
[00:56:24.346 --> 00:56:27.927]  If you guys don't want this, and we tried to fix it, then have at it, man.
[00:56:28.327 --> 00:56:29.728]  Have what you want.
[00:56:30.048 --> 00:56:36.371]  Because the Communist Chinese already basically run the universities, it's in the news, they run Hollywood, we're overrun.
[00:56:37.011 --> 00:56:43.914]  And in the 11th hour, 58th minute, we have some chance to turn it around, and the average American doesn't rally to do that?
[00:56:44.535 --> 00:56:45.315]  Shame on you!
[00:56:46.175 --> 00:56:47.536]  Because that's what we're facing.
[00:56:49.463 --> 00:56:53.689]  I just know this, the Chi-Coms won't make it out of this, and either will the EU or the Vatican.
[00:56:53.749 --> 00:56:54.790]  You're all gonna go down.
[00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:58.555]  Oh, that's a little... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I forgot the best part.
[00:56:59.196 --> 00:57:05.204]  I metaphysically know that America is gonna go down just like you are.
[00:57:06.687 --> 00:57:13.333]  And so we're going to pull all of you with us, and there are going to be overthrows of the Communist Chinese, and maybe that'll be a free country after this.
[00:57:13.993 --> 00:57:23.621]  But I know that when America goes down like the Alamo, it signifies the defeat of the Chi-Coms, and the EU, and the globalists, and everyone else.
[00:57:23.701 --> 00:57:26.003]  So, don't celebrate your victory too long.
[00:57:28.447 --> 00:57:34.430]  Don't celebrate your victory, because from hell's gate I spit at you with my last breath.
[00:57:34.850 --> 00:57:39.793]  I want you to go down, you pedophile, devil-worshipping trash, that want to control our will.
[00:57:40.053 --> 00:57:46.956]  Now there's still a chance for Humanity Awakened to turn this around, but if we're not serious, I can see where we're going.
[00:57:47.796 --> 00:57:51.258]  Trump will fail, America will fall, then we'll have global war.
[00:57:55.987 --> 00:57:58.933]  The biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest media.
[00:57:59.113 --> 00:58:04.043]  But these are among the most dishonest people you'll ever, ever meet.
[00:58:04.083 --> 00:58:06.728]  But we're gonna punch through the media.
[00:58:06.748 --> 00:58:07.449]  We have to!
[00:58:09.764 --> 00:58:15.389]  Do not allow anyone to tell you that it cannot be done.
[00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:20.113]  No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.
[00:58:20.914 --> 00:58:22.055]  We will not fail.
[00:58:22.936 --> 00:58:25.799]  Our country will thrive and prosper again.
[00:58:26.459 --> 00:58:27.860]  That whether we are black
[00:58:29.062 --> 00:58:31.684]  Or brown, or white.
[00:58:31.744 --> 00:58:35.048]  We all bleed the same red blood of patriots.
[00:58:35.088 --> 00:58:38.592]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[00:58:39.032 --> 00:58:42.596]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[00:58:43.037 --> 00:58:43.898]  Victory for the world.
[00:58:53.462 --> 00:58:58.024]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:58:58.044 --> 00:58:58.544]  Thanks for holding.
[00:58:58.604 --> 00:58:59.524]  Hey Alex, mate.
[00:58:59.684 --> 00:59:03.586]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[00:59:03.646 --> 00:59:12.389]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[00:59:12.529 --> 00:59:28.688]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[00:59:29.188 --> 00:59:37.714]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[00:59:37.774 --> 00:59:42.557]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[00:59:42.677 --> 00:59:48.281]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 Worldwide.
[00:59:54.423 --> 01:00:00.385]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:10.127]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.467 --> 01:00:13.988]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:16.509 --> 01:00:18.170]  You know, they say that hindsight is 20-20.
[01:00:20.194 --> 01:00:21.235]  I know exactly what happened.
[01:00:21.895 --> 01:00:38.789]  I was told what happened with Trump two years before he ran for office, when patriots in the Pentagon were seriously considering a coup against Obama because he gave all our codes to Communist China, all our personnel to Communist China, and the Office of Personnel Management hacked.
[01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:44.974]  And I was told all this and didn't know if it was true or not, and years later even Politico halfway reported what had happened.
[01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:52.290]  Here's what I have to say.
[01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:57.732]  Trump is on a suicide mission.
[01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:01.713]  Now a suicide mission doesn't mean you die every time.
[01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:06.595]  But you die about 30-40% of the time.
[01:01:07.335 --> 01:01:09.035]  Like you only go on a couple suicide missions.
[01:01:10.316 --> 01:01:13.997]  And that's what it is to be on a suicide squad.
[01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.998]  But you go on a suicide squad
[01:01:18.183 --> 01:01:22.905]  Because you realize you're going to lose everything anyways if you don't make it.
[01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:26.206]  Just like the divers in Thailand with the flooded cave.
[01:01:26.486 --> 01:01:29.747]  They've already gotten nine of the children out and the divers died and others.
[01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:38.731]  They got to go through almost a mile of flooded cave and they got to take kids 10, 11, 12 years old in scuba who aren't certified and take them through that hell.
[01:01:44.898 --> 01:01:45.719]  That's the same thing.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.262]  Trump is a suicide squad leader.
[01:01:50.003 --> 01:01:51.164]  That's why he's so confident.
[01:01:51.184 --> 01:01:52.486]  That's why he's so committed.
[01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:54.428]  Our code's gone.
[01:01:54.728 --> 01:01:55.909]  Our secret's all sold out.
[01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.051]  Our country de-industrialized.
[01:01:58.612 --> 01:02:02.035]  And then finally they were going to ban free speech and start arresting people.
[01:02:02.095 --> 01:02:07.841]  And enough folks in the government and in private sector and in the general citizenry said, we're not doing this.
[01:02:07.921 --> 01:02:08.622]  God Almighty.
[01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:09.922]  We were in America.
[01:02:09.962 --> 01:02:15.024]  We didn't believe the John Birch Society and Ron Paul and Alex Jones and Barry Goldwater and everybody else.
[01:02:15.404 --> 01:02:16.545]  We didn't believe them.
[01:02:16.605 --> 01:02:17.545]  It sounded so crazy.
[01:02:17.605 --> 01:02:25.347]  But we're being given orders to prepare for gun confiscation and for war against Christians and war against constitutionalists.
[01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.988]  A. We don't want to do that.
[01:02:27.008 --> 01:02:28.869]  B. They're armed to the damn tape.
[01:02:28.909 --> 01:02:31.309]  These are millions of veterans.
[01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:32.510]  That's a death sentence.
[01:02:34.025 --> 01:02:41.152]  Those are our brothers and sisters, people we know, the folks that volunteer and give blood, the people that are at the homeless shelters.
[01:02:42.433 --> 01:02:44.455]  We're being trained to have war with them?
[01:02:46.457 --> 01:02:48.679]  So a group of generals came to Trump, as I first told you.
[01:02:50.865 --> 01:02:55.950]  Three years ago, two and a half years ago, and now it's been confirmed, said, this is what we're laying out.
[01:02:56.050 --> 01:02:56.911]  We don't know what to do.
[01:02:56.971 --> 01:02:57.572]  What do you think?
[01:02:58.112 --> 01:02:58.853]  You're popular.
[01:02:58.993 --> 01:02:59.834]  We know your background.
[01:02:59.854 --> 01:03:00.735]  We know about your dad.
[01:03:01.075 --> 01:03:03.718]  We know about all you funding the John Birch Society behind the scenes.
[01:03:04.599 --> 01:03:05.680]  What do you think we should do?
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.642]  And he said, let me talk to my wife.
[01:03:07.842 --> 01:03:14.609]  And he went and spent three months in Scotland and decided not to do it.
[01:03:15.981 --> 01:03:20.524]  And then Melania came to him on the last day and she said, she'd seen what they were doing on the news to people.
[01:03:20.564 --> 01:03:21.565]  She said, you have to do it.
[01:03:23.606 --> 01:03:26.668]  He said, I don't want to put the family through this, but he said, she said, you have to.
[01:03:26.688 --> 01:03:28.349]  And he understood the challenge.
[01:03:28.369 --> 01:03:31.191]  He said, yeah, I really, I can't not do this.
[01:03:35.194 --> 01:03:36.195]  And we can't not do this.
[01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:37.736]  It's the same thing I deal with every day.
[01:03:38.636 --> 01:03:45.181]  But Communist China, allied with the big banks, has totally sold the country out.
[01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:50.226]  And they engage in every crime you can imagine, and they're trying to sabotage the economy.
[01:03:50.926 --> 01:04:01.194]  And the biggest frustration is looking at the average person that goes along with this anti-Americanism, and they don't realize they're opening the gates up to their sure and absolute destruction.
[01:04:05.978 --> 01:04:07.419]  When you look at how communist China
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.041]  has abused their own people.
[01:04:10.061 --> 01:04:14.483]  You just ask yourself, is this the way it needs to be?
[01:04:14.503 --> 01:04:31.834]  And I'm telling you, even though we think we're winning and we see good things coming back to the U.S., there's such institutional powers behind this and such an evil commitment to stop human development and human potential that I cannot lie to anybody.
[01:04:32.254 --> 01:04:33.795]  It's not my job here to lie to you.
[01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:35.896]  I think we're neck and neck.
[01:04:38.991 --> 01:04:41.733]  I think it's up in the air whether America and the world makes it.
[01:04:42.534 --> 01:04:43.615]  And you need to understand that.
[01:04:43.675 --> 01:04:52.123]  But to all of you out there that serve evil, I have no idea how you could be so blind and so committed to darkness.
[01:04:52.203 --> 01:04:54.565]  I just cannot even begin to understand it.
[01:04:55.466 --> 01:05:00.271]  You're just such traitors to your own family and your own free will, but you love your father the devil.
[01:05:00.291 --> 01:05:01.632]  So that's why you do it.
[01:05:03.889 --> 01:05:07.471]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[01:05:07.751 --> 01:05:09.051]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[01:05:09.091 --> 01:05:10.792]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[01:05:11.072 --> 01:05:13.453]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:14.434]  We've beaten six.
[01:05:14.714 --> 01:05:16.675]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:18.095]  You're my soldier.
[01:05:18.135 --> 01:05:18.856]  We're all in this together.
[01:05:19.933 --> 01:05:24.615]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[01:05:25.016 --> 01:05:37.242]  So I salute you and I thank you, but whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Infowars.com, or slash show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.
[01:05:37.282 --> 01:05:39.423]  And when you financially go to Infowarsstore.com,

[01:06:01.830 --> 01:06:03.050]  Please shop with the good guys.
[01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:15.415]  It should be so easy to win against evil, but see good men do nothing.
[01:06:15.775 --> 01:06:16.436]  So it's hard.
[01:06:16.776 --> 01:06:17.957]  It's always hard.
[01:06:18.077 --> 01:06:24.342]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.935 --> 01:06:37.477]  Well, Trump is set to announce his new Supreme Court pick in the next few days.
[01:06:37.517 --> 01:06:38.257]  We'll be covering it.
[01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:40.759]  China's military admits they're already in a war with the U.S.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.701]  They've got the media and everybody basically.
[01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:45.601]  It's China.
[01:06:45.641 --> 01:06:46.682]  China's the main engine.
[01:06:46.702 --> 01:06:47.842]  It was the plan.
[01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:50.324]  The CFR said it was the Chinese century.
[01:06:50.364 --> 01:06:51.364]  Well, it's not the Chinese century.
[01:06:51.404 --> 01:06:52.065]  It's the globalist.
[01:06:52.905 --> 01:07:07.781]  Communist century feeding off the poor Chinese to empower their oil operation because Americans on average are intuitive and smart and hard-working But the Chinese are intuitive smart and hard-working as well, but they're enslaved So it is definitely
[01:07:10.373 --> 01:07:17.457]  I want to go to Antoine, Robert, Dennis, Robert, Patrick, George, Alexander, Craig, Tony, Brandon, Eric, and others.
[01:07:18.118 --> 01:07:23.861]  Eric in Michigan, Eric in the great state of Michigan, you are back on the air, calling in on the show.
[01:07:24.382 --> 01:07:25.102]  Welcome, go ahead.
[01:07:33.808 --> 01:07:34.728]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:07:36.414 --> 01:07:37.174]  Go ahead and start over.
[01:07:37.214 --> 01:07:38.215]  They didn't get to you right away.
[01:07:38.235 --> 01:07:40.236]  I went to the end of the call, so they missed it.
[01:07:40.676 --> 01:07:41.296]  Let's just start over.
[01:07:41.337 --> 01:07:41.617]  Go ahead.
[01:07:42.557 --> 01:07:47.260]  Alex, I just wanted to kind of touch base on when you brought up, you know, to call in as a first-time caller.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:56.064]  You were going on about Hillary and how she's going to try to possibly run for 2020 and sending out emails to her supporters and followers.
[01:07:56.124 --> 01:07:58.325]  I think it's absolutely ludicrous.
[01:07:58.425 --> 01:08:00.326]  I mean, we all know she's crooked.
[01:08:00.746 --> 01:08:03.388]  You know, she's more crooked than anybody's front tooth I've ever seen.
[01:08:03.828 --> 01:08:05.629]  She's crooked and a dog's back leg.
[01:08:06.485 --> 01:08:07.286]  You know it!
[01:08:08.347 --> 01:08:13.311]  You know, but anyway, you know, so we'll see, you'll see, you know, we'll see how that plays out.
[01:08:13.351 --> 01:08:15.392]  I mean, if she does, it's going to be a failure.
[01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:17.834]  Well, the thing is, she's definitely raising money for it.
[01:08:18.014 --> 01:08:22.798]  She says, she's telling her constituents, get ready, that it shows the arrogance, though.
[01:08:22.858 --> 01:08:27.402]  Like, it just shows how disconnected from history they are.
[01:08:29.066 --> 01:08:40.138]  And the crazy thing is, she doesn't give a damn about the people or anything that has to do with America or the constituents that live in this country or even the people that vote for her.
[01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:43.181]  I mean, at the end of the day, they're just thrown to the wolves.
[01:08:43.261 --> 01:08:44.222]  She's in office, so...
[01:08:45.069 --> 01:08:47.930]  You know, I'm thankful to be in Trump's America.
[01:08:48.130 --> 01:08:49.711]  I'm glad we were able to pull it off.
[01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:51.511]  No, I agree.
[01:08:51.592 --> 01:08:52.152]  I agree with you.
[01:08:52.172 --> 01:08:54.573]  But I've got an article here out of the Oregon Live.
[01:08:55.113 --> 01:08:57.934]  Organizers of pro-gun rallies lament low turnout.
[01:08:58.294 --> 01:08:59.134]  And that's what's happening.
[01:08:59.495 --> 01:09:04.657]  A lot of patriots, conservative Christians, pro-gunners think we're winning.
[01:09:05.157 --> 01:09:06.577]  Yes, we're in a war.
[01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:08.038]  We've won some battles.
[01:09:09.193 --> 01:09:13.775]  I don't want to use the North versus South analogy, but it's kind of like the South winning battles early on.
[01:09:13.795 --> 01:09:16.017]  Let me tell you something.
[01:09:16.157 --> 01:09:18.818]  The globalists are coming down like a ton of bricks, brother.
[01:09:19.338 --> 01:09:22.580]  And so I was telling people that we woke up the enemy.
[01:09:23.480 --> 01:09:24.621]  And I think we will win.
[01:09:24.721 --> 01:09:27.983]  But if people don't get that, we're in the fight of our lives.
[01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:31.004]  Getting Trump elected was like landing at Normandy.
[01:09:31.665 --> 01:09:34.606]  When we landed at Normandy, you know, in 1943, did that mean we beat Hitler?
[01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:39.470]  No, no.
[01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:46.255]  Lots of gunshed still at that point, but, you know, it's an uphill battle, you know, and I'm willing to fight it every step of the way.
[01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:48.056]  I think we really need to come together.
[01:09:48.076 --> 01:09:48.897]  No, I agree with you.
[01:09:48.937 --> 01:09:53.881]  What do you think of the 133 attacks last week or so, and all these attacks on conservatives?
[01:09:54.401 --> 01:09:57.163]  I mean, physical attacks, trying to kill people.
[01:09:57.523 --> 01:10:00.566]  I mean, the left is clearly launching an intimidation campaign.
[01:10:01.006 --> 01:10:02.027]  I think it's going to backfire.
[01:10:02.873 --> 01:10:04.075]  It's totally going to backfire.
[01:10:04.115 --> 01:10:13.811]  I can't recall her name, but the lady that was part of Trump's cabinet that was at that restaurant up in Virginia that got kicked out the other week, you know... Huckabee Sanders.
[01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:22.764]  Right, and Maxine Waters is totally stirring the pot on that side of the stick, you know, telling them, oh, shut them out of restaurants, out of gas stations, this, that, the other.
[01:10:23.544 --> 01:10:27.966]  How do they think that makes somebody give up on their political views?
[01:10:28.526 --> 01:10:30.167]  Most people are just busy.
[01:10:30.507 --> 01:10:35.809]  But if you, like, try to kick me out of a restaurant, everybody I know, that makes them get angry, right?
[01:10:36.573 --> 01:10:40.714]  Right, and I don't care if it's my favorite Philly cheesesteak restaurant on the planet.
[01:10:40.774 --> 01:10:45.196]  If they're going to kick me out for my, you know, right of opinion, I'm not going to support them anymore.
[01:10:45.236 --> 01:10:46.776]  So chances are they're going to go out of business.
[01:10:46.836 --> 01:10:50.877]  Well, that's the point, Eric, is it doesn't make you give up your political views.
[01:10:50.897 --> 01:10:52.158]  It doesn't make you back down.
[01:10:52.198 --> 01:10:53.118]  It emboldens you.
[01:10:53.478 --> 01:10:56.059]  So they think we're like them, a bunch of peer pressure wimps.
[01:10:56.099 --> 01:10:56.579]  God bless you.
[01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:58.950]  Okay, I went to the bottom of the calls.
[01:10:59.231 --> 01:11:03.192]  That may have confused the folks clicking the calls, because I could punch my own buttons, but I have them doing it in there.
[01:11:03.212 --> 01:11:04.912]  So, we're going to go to another call.
[01:11:05.572 --> 01:11:06.653]  Who should we go to here?
[01:11:08.193 --> 01:11:09.773]  Who should we go to next?
[01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:14.315]  Let's talk to Brandon in Texas.
[01:11:15.095 --> 01:11:17.836]  He says he wants to talk about my predictions in endgame.
[01:11:18.216 --> 01:11:19.156]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[01:11:19.176 --> 01:11:19.716]  Thanks for holding.
[01:11:21.417 --> 01:11:22.317]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[01:11:23.683 --> 01:11:26.204]  Yeah, I'm a long, long time listener.
[01:11:26.304 --> 01:11:27.305]  First time caller.
[01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:27.885]  Welcome.
[01:11:28.245 --> 01:11:28.906]  And can you hear me?
[01:11:28.926 --> 01:11:29.226]  Okay.
[01:11:33.268 --> 01:11:33.708]  Can you hear me?
[01:11:33.728 --> 01:11:34.028]  Okay.
[01:11:34.048 --> 01:11:35.509]  I can hear you really good.
[01:11:36.369 --> 01:11:36.910]  Okay, great.
[01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:39.691]  Well, I went to Crockett High School in the early 90s, man.
[01:11:39.791 --> 01:11:45.554]  I just, I want everybody that's listening to you to know that you have been calling it out, calling it out.
[01:11:46.325 --> 01:11:47.205]  Since day one.
[01:11:47.365 --> 01:11:48.926]  Your motives have never shifted.
[01:11:48.966 --> 01:11:50.627]  You're like Ron Paul.
[01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:51.767]  You're like a rock, right?
[01:11:52.147 --> 01:11:53.068]  Now, that's integrity.
[01:11:53.088 --> 01:11:53.888]  You're a real man.
[01:11:54.108 --> 01:11:55.809]  And that's not a cool thing these days.
[01:11:55.889 --> 01:11:56.389]  I get that.
[01:11:56.969 --> 01:12:03.351]  But, you know, you red-pilled me way back with Endgame, a blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:12:03.772 --> 01:12:06.232]  And when I say red-pill, I mean Pregnalone, brother.
[01:12:06.673 --> 01:12:08.553]  You put me down for like seven days.
[01:12:08.653 --> 01:12:11.294]  I was almost straight-up depressed, right?
[01:12:13.883 --> 01:12:15.905]  I researched all the history in that movie.
[01:12:16.485 --> 01:12:17.326]  You're on point.
[01:12:17.906 --> 01:12:32.578]  Everything that's unfolded in this day-to-day bullshit, I'm not a political person, but I have become a political person because these things are unfolding day-by-day just like you said they would, and now they're to the surface like a big fuckin' shit.
[01:12:32.718 --> 01:12:33.158]  Oh, whoops.
[01:12:33.378 --> 01:12:34.079]  I didn't mean to say that.
[01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:35.960]  We're gonna let you go, but I appreciate your call.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.682]  We can't have cussing because we got a delay at once.
[01:12:37.722 --> 01:12:38.862]  You cuss again, we gotta let you go.
[01:12:38.882 --> 01:12:41.705]  But that's the thing, is I'm not that smart.
[01:12:42.745 --> 01:12:45.106]  The globalists have all written their battle plans.
[01:12:45.686 --> 01:12:46.647]  They're carrying them out.
[01:12:46.707 --> 01:12:47.667]  They're anti-human.
[01:12:48.187 --> 01:12:49.788]  We need to be aware of it.
[01:12:49.888 --> 01:12:52.509]  And then you need to make a decision which side you're on.
[01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:55.150]  Let's go to a caller in Illinois.
[01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:58.451]  Let's go to Antoine in Illinois.
[01:12:58.471 --> 01:13:00.012]  Antoine, thanks for calling.
[01:13:00.032 --> 01:13:00.392]  Go ahead.
[01:13:01.092 --> 01:13:01.752]  Hello, Alex.
[01:13:01.812 --> 01:13:02.332]  How are you?
[01:13:02.352 --> 01:13:03.733]  This is Antoine in Illinois.
[01:13:03.753 --> 01:13:05.434]  How are you, brother?
[01:13:05.454 --> 01:13:06.014]  How are you doing?
[01:13:06.334 --> 01:13:06.854]  I'm good, man.
[01:13:06.894 --> 01:13:07.414]  Good to talk to you.
[01:13:08.335 --> 01:13:11.296]  It is such a pleasure to finally connect with you, my friend.
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:17.765]  I just want to start off by telling you I am so proud of what you and your organization have done.
[01:13:18.305 --> 01:13:28.233]  Years ago, when I was a college student at Northern Illinois University, some colleagues of mine, we did the same thing you did on the college level in the late 80s and the early 90s.
[01:13:28.674 --> 01:13:34.218]  And I wanted to know if you were familiar with a mentor of mine by the name of Stephen Coakley.
[01:13:34.758 --> 01:13:39.802]  He was an eco-activist, African-American from the Chicagoland area.
[01:13:40.905 --> 01:13:49.730]  He was well-renowned for teaching about the Illuminati, the Boulé, FEMA, Rose Rochdale, the whole nine yards.
[01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:50.651]  What was his name again?
[01:13:51.811 --> 01:13:53.192]  His name is Stephen Cokie.
[01:13:53.212 --> 01:13:54.373]  Now, he's passed on now.
[01:13:55.053 --> 01:13:56.114]  But his name was Stephen Cokie.
[01:13:56.154 --> 01:13:57.654]  I mean, the name seems familiar.
[01:13:57.674 --> 01:14:05.519]  For people to know about the Boulé, that's the African American version of the Masons that they then kind of try to use to control people, right?
[01:14:06.181 --> 01:14:07.282]  That's exactly right.
[01:14:07.562 --> 01:14:12.365]  Stephen Cokie was very known for that on the grassroots level, very popular.
[01:14:12.965 --> 01:14:24.173]  Again, he was my mentor along with, I know you're pretty good friends with Brother Minister Louis Farrakhan, but I just wanted to see if you were familiar with him because he was doing this before there was a Facebook, YouTube.
[01:14:24.253 --> 01:14:28.556]  Yes, I remember the name and as for Louis Farrakhan, he's a great
[01:14:29.477 --> 01:14:30.077]  I think so.
[01:14:52.683 --> 01:15:07.146]  I know he's been kind of back and forth trying to get his constituents to understand what's happening, but I think with this message saying Trump is destroying all our enemies a month ago, do you think people in the Nation of Islam got how far Farrakhan's going trying to warn them of the battle we're in right now?
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:08.761]  I do.
[01:15:08.841 --> 01:15:11.282]  I think it's going to take more teaching about that.
[01:15:11.783 --> 01:15:25.353]  One of the reasons why I was really glad to see Trump run for office, because he broke, he was trying to break the stranglehold that many of the politicians have had on this country for years, including him.
[01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:26.254]  Exactly.
[01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:30.137]  Trump is very, not simple in the word simple, but very straightforward.
[01:15:30.597 --> 01:15:32.358]  He wants prosperity for everybody.
[01:15:33.219 --> 01:15:35.240]  He does not look, he looks who a person is.
[01:15:36.141 --> 01:15:38.762]  Like Martin Luther King said, like, not the color of the skin, who they are.
[01:15:39.703 --> 01:15:41.103]  And Farrakhan looks right at me.
[01:15:41.723 --> 01:15:45.805]  And said, no, I think Trump overall is going to shake the system up, is going to win.
[01:15:45.825 --> 01:15:48.446]  And he said, and I think you know that.
[01:15:48.466 --> 01:15:49.327]  And he said, but you know.
[01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:55.189]  And I said, listen, I don't have any real communication with Trump except every once in a while.
[01:15:55.209 --> 01:15:57.730]  But Farrakhan was pro-Trump when I met with him.
[01:15:57.810 --> 01:15:58.831]  Thank you, Antoine.
[01:15:58.851 --> 01:15:59.231]  We'll be back.
[01:16:02.938 --> 01:16:05.259]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[01:16:05.279 --> 01:16:07.019]  We're really, really proud of it.

[01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.650]  Go ahead.
[01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:09.931]  Alex, last night I was on with Laura Ingram.
[01:18:10.111 --> 01:18:12.471]  And I had done the Alex Jones Show yesterday.
[01:18:12.491 --> 01:18:13.792]  I had done The War Room.
[01:18:14.092 --> 01:18:16.532]  She's not on until 9.40 Central.
[01:18:16.552 --> 01:18:18.113]  That's 10.40 Eastern.
[01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:18.773]  I was exhausted.
[01:18:19.093 --> 01:18:22.374]  I popped two Brain Force Plus and I was good as new.
[01:18:22.714 --> 01:18:27.355]  I mean, it really is mentally stabilizing, mentally energizing.
[01:18:27.435 --> 01:18:29.456]  Tonight, I'm on with Tucker Carlson.
[01:18:29.616 --> 01:18:30.196]  Uh, the same thing.
[01:18:30.376 --> 01:18:32.277]  I'm gonna put in a full day here at InfoWars.
[01:18:32.377 --> 01:18:33.598]  I'm gonna go on the Tucker tonight.
[01:18:33.778 --> 01:18:35.620]  Thank goodness for this great product.
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.464]  This is my all-time favorite because it's so effective and it doesn't give you that jacked-up energy drink feeling.
[01:18:41.564 --> 01:18:42.985]  You know, you can sleep with it.
[01:18:43.325 --> 01:18:47.628]  And when you stack it with the Red Pill, the mind-body combination, that is the best.
[01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:50.470]  That supercharges your energy, your vitality.
[01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.331]  This is the best combination I have found.
[01:18:52.471 --> 01:18:53.151]  It really works.
[01:18:53.391 --> 01:18:57.914]  It's the best mineral-vitamin combination I have found and I've tried them all.
[01:19:00.196 --> 01:19:00.623]  Believe me.
[01:19:05.930 --> 01:19:07.330]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:08.831]  Victor, you're calling.
[01:19:08.891 --> 01:19:09.231]  Go ahead.
[01:19:09.351 --> 01:19:09.631]  Yes.
[01:19:10.071 --> 01:19:10.771]  Hi, Alex.
[01:19:10.891 --> 01:19:17.093]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[01:19:17.293 --> 01:19:21.275]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[01:19:21.515 --> 01:19:22.955]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[01:19:23.335 --> 01:19:32.958]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet and it's like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[01:19:33.859 --> 01:19:38.563]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:19:38.583 --> 01:19:46.429]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:52.254]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet colloidal silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[01:19:52.414 --> 01:19:57.718]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality colloidal silver.
[01:19:57.798 --> 01:20:00.801]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[01:20:06.127 --> 01:20:10.849]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.554 --> 01:20:24.835]  There's an attempt to turn off the world economy.
[01:20:25.335 --> 01:20:29.536]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[01:20:29.737 --> 01:20:30.277]  And you tried it.
[01:20:30.317 --> 01:20:33.818]  A frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[01:20:33.838 --> 01:20:34.358]  But you failed.
[01:20:34.418 --> 01:20:35.639]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:36.650 --> 01:20:39.172]  Do you still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[01:20:39.532 --> 01:20:42.735]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[01:20:42.795 --> 01:20:50.441]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[01:20:50.481 --> 01:20:52.503]  This story does not add up.
[01:20:54.985 --> 01:20:59.609]  Mueller and the Bushes and the Clintons thought they'd stage 9-11 with their Islamic buddies.
[01:21:01.221 --> 01:21:04.203]  And now you notice Trump played that card during the campaign.
[01:21:04.804 --> 01:21:13.290]  He played it back the week after the attack happened, saying he believed there were bombs in the buildings because his engineer that he hired built the World Trade Center.
[01:21:15.492 --> 01:21:19.295]  The architect that built it, a Japanese-American, said that it was blown up.
[01:21:21.337 --> 01:21:22.698]  And Trump's just sitting back.
[01:21:22.718 --> 01:21:25.520]  If he could play that card up front, they'd say he's crazy.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.481]  He's got to turn the economy around.
[01:21:28.862 --> 01:21:30.384]  He's got to unify people together.
[01:21:31.496 --> 01:21:33.937]  He's got to defeat the Deep State, and then he's going to bring it out.
[01:21:34.037 --> 01:21:57.162]  But, you notice when I came out last Monday and told you that Trump is looking to release the fact that Mueller covered up 9-11, which has already been documented, they've got a string of more than 30 senior FBI agents, current and retired, ready to expose how they were ordered to shut up by the Clintons, by the Bushes, and then by Mueller.
[01:21:57.762 --> 01:21:58.542]  Ha ha ha!
[01:21:58.902 --> 01:21:59.263]  Mueller!
[01:22:01.483 --> 01:22:02.444]  It's the Ace of Spades.
[01:22:03.224 --> 01:22:05.966]  Building 7, the FBI-CIA headquarters blown up.
[01:22:05.986 --> 01:22:06.727]  The bomb's in it.
[01:22:07.387 --> 01:22:08.908]  The witness protection programs.
[01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:11.190]  Oh yeah.
[01:22:12.171 --> 01:22:13.672]  Barry Jennings all of it.
[01:22:15.273 --> 01:22:20.757]  These guys are so cowards that they couldn't even imagine talking about this out loud.
[01:22:21.757 --> 01:22:26.581]  And the pedophile airplanes with Jeffrey Epstein and Mueller running it for the FBI.
[01:22:27.561 --> 01:22:28.422]  All of it's coming out.
[01:22:32.443 --> 01:22:33.023]  So good luck.
[01:22:38.667 --> 01:22:45.212]  Because no matter what you do, Mueller, no matter what Bill Clinton does, no matter what you do, it's all coming out now.
[01:22:45.812 --> 01:22:46.753]  You want to bang heads?
[01:22:48.414 --> 01:22:49.915]  You guys keep looking for a fight.
[01:22:51.116 --> 01:22:53.017]  You found one, didn't you?
[01:22:53.838 --> 01:22:59.422]  We're going to bang heads with you so hard, you're not going to even know what to do.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:06.361]  If you want to bang heads with me, you came to the right spot.
[01:23:08.081 --> 01:23:10.422]  See, with me, it's not some macho thing.
[01:23:10.642 --> 01:23:11.402]  It's life and death.
[01:23:11.822 --> 01:23:13.923]  My soul hangs over the precipice of eternity.
[01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:17.704]  Maybe for what my ancestors did, or what I did, whatever it is.
[01:23:17.764 --> 01:23:19.864]  I just know God wants me to take you down.
[01:23:19.884 --> 01:23:28.666]  All you narcissistic, mental patient, scumbag, deep state, white shoe boy, butt smelling, Ivy League turds.
[01:23:29.767 --> 01:23:31.287]  All that matters is you burning out.
[01:23:37.165 --> 01:23:42.467]  So just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
[01:23:43.627 --> 01:23:49.970]  And just like Hitler in that bunker, as we close in on you, you're into the right thing, aren't you?
[01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.991]  I know you are.
[01:23:52.011 --> 01:24:06.196]  I want to go to Robert in Seattle, and Dennis in Kentucky, and Robert in Pennsylvania, and Patrick in Indiana, and George in Las Vegas, and Alexander in Alpine, Illinois, and Craig in Arizona, and Tony in Texas, and many others.
[01:24:07.679 --> 01:24:13.200]  Right now, let's go to Robert in Seattle, in the deep state stronghold of Jeff Bezos.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:14.200]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:24:16.681 --> 01:24:18.401]  Alex, pleasure to speak with you.
[01:24:19.801 --> 01:24:25.762]  First, I'd like to say thank you for red pilling me, opening my eyes to what's really going on.
[01:24:25.782 --> 01:24:29.643]  Second thing, I'm a white male.
[01:24:30.243 --> 01:24:31.083]  I work hard.
[01:24:31.403 --> 01:24:32.843]  I was raised by my grandparents.
[01:24:33.543 --> 01:24:36.444]  Taught me an honest day's work, the value of a dollar.
[01:24:37.375 --> 01:24:42.216]  I'm heading to Home Depot today to go work on my house because the economy's doing so well.
[01:24:42.316 --> 01:24:43.416]  I got a nice raise.
[01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:46.117]  I actually can afford to buy things now.
[01:24:47.137 --> 01:24:53.938]  And I live in the area with all these med jobs that walk around that, you know, have no idea what they're talking about.
[01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:57.639]  When you engage them in conversation, they go right to the attacks.
[01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:01.280]  And I feel like I walk around with a target on my back.
[01:25:01.340 --> 01:25:06.021]  I've actually wore a Trump shirt out one day, gotten several arguments.
[01:25:06.829 --> 01:25:08.850]  And it's mostly around the Seattle area.
[01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:10.310]  I haven't been to Portland.
[01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:13.291]  I want to go August 4th.
[01:25:13.632 --> 01:25:20.754]  I suggest you don't go because I think something would happen bad if you were seen on site.
[01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:22.455]  So for you, you stay back.
[01:25:22.575 --> 01:25:23.535]  You do what you need to do.
[01:25:23.555 --> 01:25:24.116]  Let's be clear.
[01:25:24.236 --> 01:25:25.636]  Antifa is attacking people.
[01:25:25.736 --> 01:25:30.278]  I've been to Seattle because my wife wanted to go visit some family she has that lives there.
[01:25:31.038 --> 01:25:35.280]  And, like, I walk outside the first 10 minutes and people are attacking me.
[01:25:36.124 --> 01:25:37.184]  Now, let's be clear.
[01:25:38.245 --> 01:25:46.607]  I'd shake 10, 15 hands and have folks wave at me for every person that attacked me, but still, they are crazed.
[01:25:46.667 --> 01:25:55.150]  And I've got a stack of news I haven't gotten to of all, of just the attacks and all of it, but they are absolutely crazed, man.
[01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.111]  And they're pissed.
[01:25:57.511 --> 01:25:59.912]  They are fundamentally hate America.
[01:25:59.952 --> 01:26:01.252]  They'll tell you they hate America.
[01:26:01.292 --> 01:26:04.173]  And it's like, but you live here, morons.
[01:26:05.802 --> 01:26:07.664]  All the antidepressants people are on, man.
[01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:08.565]  I got off of them.
[01:26:08.946 --> 01:26:10.848]  Some of your supplements kind of woke me up.
[01:26:10.868 --> 01:26:12.270]  You know, the iodine really helped.
[01:26:13.391 --> 01:26:20.340]  But it's just, you know, I questioned God a while back, and I realized that my job in life is to protect my family.
[01:26:21.243 --> 01:26:27.168]  Protect my freedom, protect my right to do what I want to do without impeding on people, and that's what I do every day.
[01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:27.728]  No, I agree.
[01:26:27.788 --> 01:26:28.409]  Work hard.
[01:26:28.949 --> 01:26:31.872]  I agree, but you mentioned how, like, St.
[01:26:31.912 --> 01:26:33.753]  John's Wort, we don't even sell that, we should.
[01:26:34.554 --> 01:26:37.136]  In major studies, it's like double better than Prozac.
[01:26:38.497 --> 01:26:40.439]  But the issue is dead time toxic effects.
[01:26:41.954 --> 01:26:42.254]  Is that
[01:26:59.502 --> 01:27:00.343]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:01.683]  I, like, lost 30, 40 pounds.
[01:27:01.803 --> 01:27:02.544]  It always stayed off.
[01:27:02.944 --> 01:27:03.925]  My libido's better.
[01:27:03.965 --> 01:27:05.145]  It's like I'm 16 years old.
[01:27:05.546 --> 01:27:07.307]  But again, it's the iodine conspiracy.
[01:27:07.327 --> 01:27:07.907]  Let me tell you something.
[01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:10.389]  To be a man is to be expendable.
[01:27:11.029 --> 01:27:12.730]  And that doesn't mean you don't have worth.
[01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:13.570]  You have great worth.
[01:27:14.811 --> 01:27:16.092]  Men are expendable.
[01:27:16.472 --> 01:27:30.640]  And exactly what you said, the minute you realize being a man isn't about choosing the biggest gang or always being on the winning team, it's about doing what's right, being strong, and not caring what other weak people say, but following the compass God gave you.
[01:27:31.454 --> 01:27:35.477]  And so, I know what it is to wear a Trump shirt or an Infowars shirt outside.
[01:27:35.537 --> 01:27:38.339]  I know what it is in a blue state area to go through that.
[01:27:38.399 --> 01:27:47.165]  We have to do that and use those opportunities when they do it to videotape it, as we're doing, to just expose that these are authoritarians.
[01:27:47.605 --> 01:27:51.628]  Imagine if we give in to them now, how bad it will be later.
[01:27:52.048 --> 01:27:53.009]  So that's men's job.
[01:27:53.449 --> 01:27:56.972]  The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in a moment of comfort.
[01:27:57.512 --> 01:28:01.153]  Or convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.
[01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:01.713]  Martin Luther King.
[01:28:01.733 --> 01:28:07.275]  If you look at Martin Luther King, he said, don't judge somebody on what color they are, what gender they are, what they do.
[01:28:07.675 --> 01:28:08.135]  Just like me.
[01:28:08.155 --> 01:28:08.775]  You got good food?
[01:28:08.795 --> 01:28:09.456]  I go to your restaurant.
[01:28:09.496 --> 01:28:10.296]  Got good music?
[01:28:10.316 --> 01:28:10.616]  I listen to you.
[01:28:10.636 --> 01:28:11.596]  I don't care if you're black or white.
[01:28:11.976 --> 01:28:13.117]  I listen to some song.
[01:28:13.956 --> 01:28:19.277]  Whether it be hip-hop, or country, or blues, or... I don't think... Well, this is a black artist, let me click on that.
[01:28:19.297 --> 01:28:23.618]  Or this is a white artist, or this is a Hispanic artist, or... I'm gonna go see a Mexican director.
[01:28:23.778 --> 01:28:25.198]  They do have, like, some of the best directors.
[01:28:26.659 --> 01:28:27.799]  I just go, oh, that was a great movie.
[01:28:27.819 --> 01:28:28.299]  Who's the director?
[01:28:28.359 --> 01:28:29.119]  Oh, it's another Mexican.
[01:28:30.119 --> 01:28:33.140]  It's not like some cliche, it's with the patterns you notice in life.
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.361]  And so, that's what I'm getting at here, is that...
[01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:40.096]  We have free will, and we're gonna do it.
[01:28:40.176 --> 01:28:41.137]  God bless you, Robert.
[01:28:41.537 --> 01:28:42.597]  In Seattle, keep it up.
[01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:46.818]  Dennis in Kentucky, where they just attacked the Senate Majority Leader last night.
[01:28:47.418 --> 01:28:49.839]  And so much more, straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[01:28:50.679 --> 01:28:54.240]  But listen, no matter what happens, this life is only a test.
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:57.021]  Our relationship with God is numero uno.
[01:29:02.502 --> 01:29:06.143]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement.
[01:29:08.271 --> 01:29:23.278]  We are launching our biggest recruitment and hiring operation ever in our 23-year history as we prepare to go 24 hours a day live on TV and radio from the InfoWars News Center here in Austin, Texas.

[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:35.622]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.
[01:30:35.962 --> 01:30:53.461]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.

[01:30:58.726 --> 01:31:03.869]  But it's critical that as fast as you can, you get your portfolio, your reel, into us.

[01:31:29.403 --> 01:31:32.085]  We are expanding in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[01:31:32.425 --> 01:31:33.666]  We are not victims.
[01:31:33.846 --> 01:31:35.067]  We are victorious.
[01:31:35.427 --> 01:31:40.390]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:45.154]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color, and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.
[01:31:45.634 --> 01:31:49.517]  Again, InfoWars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules.
[01:31:50.137 --> 01:31:54.559]  And I'll see you on the front lines of the fight against the NWO.
[01:32:01.702 --> 01:32:06.944]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by InfoWars Life.
[01:32:07.665 --> 01:32:10.986]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:32:11.827 --> 01:32:18.069]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:26.216]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:32:27.037 --> 01:32:32.261]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:32:32.882 --> 01:32:45.013]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[01:32:45.533 --> 01:32:48.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.353 --> 01:33:39.785]  Split break the silence Waking from the dead of night Vengeance is boiling His return to kill the light
[01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:47.292]  You know, I want to just say this because it's important for people to know.
[01:33:47.312 --> 01:33:50.835]  It's not like InfoWars is that important or we're on a power trip.
[01:33:50.855 --> 01:33:52.617]  It's just important to metaphysically say it.
[01:33:56.059 --> 01:34:00.563]  Before I ever knew what I was doing, I got offered pretty big Hollywood roles.
[01:34:01.324 --> 01:34:04.967]  Like out of the gates, you know, two, three minutes talking major movies.
[01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:06.588]  And paychecks.
[01:34:07.409 --> 01:34:08.830]  And voiceover deals.
[01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:10.792]  I made a million dollars.
[01:34:12.262 --> 01:34:17.063]  On a voiceover I did for a national insurance company through a union in a year.
[01:34:17.083 --> 01:34:20.364]  For like $900-something thousand dollars.
[01:34:21.124 --> 01:34:21.744]  And you know what I did?
[01:34:22.104 --> 01:34:24.825]  I put it right in the general fund and built Infowars.
[01:34:25.825 --> 01:34:28.386]  Not that money's bad, but I don't care about that.
[01:34:28.786 --> 01:34:35.188]  If I got a car that runs great, got medicine, got a house, that's why they want to keep you poor.
[01:34:35.208 --> 01:34:39.729]  They want to keep you down on a level where you never get to the realization that it doesn't matter at a certain level.
[01:34:41.755 --> 01:34:46.099]  Most of the time, I fly a coach on a plane, because what's the point of paying three times more?
[01:34:47.820 --> 01:34:51.824]  But I've been offered all these big Hollywood roles, and man, they got bigger.
[01:34:53.385 --> 01:34:54.346]  Ones I wouldn't sell out.
[01:34:58.530 --> 01:34:59.831]  So I turned down $10 million a year in 2002.
[01:34:59.871 --> 01:35:03.054]  $10 million a year, no employees to me.
[01:35:09.505 --> 01:35:14.208]  Now all these years later we bring in way more than that, but it pays for all the crew and all the satellites and the rest of it.
[01:35:14.228 --> 01:35:16.790]  But I just, it's like Hollywood thinks it's God.
[01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:18.511]  It thinks you've got to go with it.
[01:35:18.611 --> 01:35:28.818]  And even the conservative end of Hollywood says, you know, I'm a billion dollar producer and these are nice people, but we want you to go make this movie and make this show.
[01:35:28.838 --> 01:35:36.583]  And it's like, I can't do that because every time I agree to it, it then has to go through this process of being watered down.
[01:35:39.753 --> 01:35:55.856]  What is important, and I only make this point because I just got this phone call, in a big hot movie that's being produced, they wanted me in a major role, I wouldn't do it, then it was a smaller role, then it was a cameo, it's nothing against the production.
[01:35:56.696 --> 01:36:03.677]  It's that, you understand, I can't refuse Hollywood and then not refuse a part of it.
[01:36:04.857 --> 01:36:06.838]  What is powerful?
[01:36:07.978 --> 01:36:08.758]  What is real?
[01:36:09.992 --> 01:36:13.655]  Is directly talking to you, unscripted, live.
[01:36:14.115 --> 01:36:14.976]  This isn't an act.
[01:36:17.598 --> 01:36:18.379]  And that's the whole thing.
[01:36:18.439 --> 01:36:23.243]  Like, I remember growing up, my mom watching the Oscars thinking, boy, that's really cool.
[01:36:23.283 --> 01:36:24.404]  Those are really the cool people.
[01:36:25.225 --> 01:36:27.547]  And by college, they were like, Mom, I go home.
[01:36:28.147 --> 01:36:29.288]  Mom, you're watching the Oscars.
[01:36:29.308 --> 01:36:30.169]  They're a bunch of losers.
[01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:34.012]  And so it's just so liberating.
[01:36:36.038 --> 01:36:37.540]  To not care about that.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.966]  And then people can't believe, they just can't believe, like, you don't want the History Channel Show.
[01:36:43.927 --> 01:36:45.709]  You don't want the Discovery Channel Show.
[01:36:45.729 --> 01:36:47.952]  And I'm like, I already got two or three of them.
[01:36:50.955 --> 01:36:53.017]  They never even know I have two or three of each.
[01:36:53.037 --> 01:36:55.020]  I already did it.
[01:36:55.941 --> 01:36:56.942]  And not to sell out,
[01:36:58.735 --> 01:37:02.958]  I just was like, sure, I'll do your show, I'll host your show, and then they put it on.
[01:37:04.198 --> 01:37:05.919]  It's such a joke, man.
[01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:09.261]  It's like all these other talk show hosting people.
[01:37:09.441 --> 01:37:10.742]  Yeah, look at that shot of all the other people.
[01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:11.903]  Look at them.
[01:37:12.503 --> 01:37:13.484]  They're the actors.
[01:37:13.544 --> 01:37:14.784]  They're the candy ass.
[01:37:15.725 --> 01:37:21.208]  They want to be the big star on TV, like Meryl Streep promoting pedophilia.
[01:37:23.449 --> 01:37:27.772]  And like, somebody like me has got to be, no, I don't want to be in that.
[01:37:30.049 --> 01:37:33.990]  And then it's always the pitch, like, we'll censor you if you don't.
[01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:35.790]  We'll come after you.
[01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:37.471]  No, I already got the message.
[01:37:38.931 --> 01:37:41.692]  But what hurts is friends I've had.
[01:37:42.312 --> 01:37:44.352]  In some cases, 20 years that were truthful.
[01:37:45.652 --> 01:37:50.633]  And when they get threatened, they roll over like a dead hog in the middle of a pool in summer.
[01:37:51.434 --> 01:37:52.454]  They just roll over.
[01:37:52.474 --> 01:37:57.855]  It's very, very sad.
[01:38:01.417 --> 01:38:12.319]  But I do, historically and metaphysically and ritually, reject Hollywood and reject everything associated with it.
[01:38:13.099 --> 01:38:15.440]  I will have nothing to do with it.
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:16.380]  Nothing.
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:17.820]  Nothing.
[01:38:18.981 --> 01:38:19.361]  Zero.
[01:38:20.381 --> 01:38:20.781]  Zero.
[01:38:21.881 --> 01:38:23.501]  Absolute, total zero.
[01:38:23.521 --> 01:38:24.802]  You understand that?
[01:38:24.882 --> 01:38:31.083]  So... It's like Fox News tried to give me three different TV shows.
[01:38:33.342 --> 01:38:40.649]  And then when I refused the third one after about two years, they had a big article in the New York Daily News, back when I was like, you know, being attacked once a week in the news.
[01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:41.810]  Now it's like every five seconds.
[01:38:42.411 --> 01:38:47.435]  And it was like, Jones wanted a job at Fox News, but he got rejected.
[01:38:47.896 --> 01:38:52.180]  And again, it's not about me bragging, oh, I got offered a job at Fox News.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:55.323]  It was like, I got offered a job drinking out of porta-potties.
[01:38:58.635 --> 01:39:00.236]  And look, I'm glad Hannity's there.
[01:39:00.897 --> 01:39:02.398]  I'm glad Carlson's there.
[01:39:02.418 --> 01:39:03.078]  They're great people.
[01:39:03.578 --> 01:39:04.739]  I'm glad Lou Dobbs is there.
[01:39:05.039 --> 01:39:05.960]  I'm glad Laura Ingraham's there.
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:16.627]  I'm not saying Fox is bad, but the producers and the managers and the jerks, the types that fired Matt Drudge when he had the top rated show there, they're the losers!
[01:39:18.188 --> 01:39:19.890]  And Matt Drudge doesn't need them.
[01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:21.571]  I don't need them.
[01:39:22.131 --> 01:39:25.894]  That's what I'm trying to say, is that I, I'm innately me.
[01:39:28.134 --> 01:39:36.760]  And I'll never forgive Fox News trying to give me three shows, and I was like, you're kidding.
[01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:48.469]  I get on a plane Friday night, and I fly there and tape Saturday and air Sunday, where I move to New York, so I could, and I don't see my, they're like, oh, this is a big chance for you.
[01:39:50.690 --> 01:39:51.811]  And then they'd rape me.
[01:39:52.812 --> 01:39:56.935]  They would rape me and say that I wanted them.
[01:39:57.930 --> 01:40:02.632]  You know, it's like the ugly girl in high school that tries to get her brother to fight you.
[01:40:03.372 --> 01:40:05.033]  He's like, screw you, you were mean to my sister.
[01:40:05.553 --> 01:40:10.735]  And he kind of slammed his head in the wall and he goes, and his sister runs over and says, Bobby, he didn't really do it.
[01:40:10.755 --> 01:40:11.235]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:19.138]  It's like, it's, it's, it's not like, it's like Fox News so I can sell catheter lines.
[01:40:21.419 --> 01:40:22.599]  I want to change history.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.241]  I want to bust up the establishment.
[01:40:29.093 --> 01:40:30.154]  I want to change the world.
[01:40:30.334 --> 01:40:32.977]  I don't want to be in Hollywood movies.
[01:40:33.738 --> 01:40:35.360]  I don't want an HBO show.
[01:40:36.381 --> 01:40:38.883]  I don't want what you have.
[01:40:39.284 --> 01:40:46.872]  And I've told you hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times, I want to break your neck.
[01:40:48.133 --> 01:40:50.676]  I don't want to hang out with you soulless scumbags.
[01:40:57.952 --> 01:41:00.334]  Yeah, that's what they really went after when Media Matters figured it out.
[01:41:01.195 --> 01:41:02.936]  Because there's all these fake ratings out there.
[01:41:02.976 --> 01:41:05.758]  But listen, I'm going to stop right there and come back and take a few final calls.
[01:41:06.339 --> 01:41:08.180]  And I haven't plugged in an hour and 40 minutes.
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.541]  I'm going to tell you this right now.
[01:41:09.561 --> 01:41:11.623]  Here's the deal.
[01:41:12.323 --> 01:41:15.786]  They ask, why don't I plug every segment like other talk show hosts if we need to fund ourselves?
[01:41:16.026 --> 01:41:16.847]  Because it's boring.
[01:41:18.948 --> 01:41:23.352]  And if people are called to get our products that are excellent, just like our information, they're going to do it.
[01:41:24.821 --> 01:41:30.386]  But our July 4th specials for July 4th, 2nd American Revolution Week, have got to end in the next few days.
[01:41:31.267 --> 01:41:40.937]  And it's 50% off a bunch of our best-selling items like Brain Force, Super Mel Vitality, you name it.
[01:41:40.957 --> 01:41:44.260]  It's got 4.8 stars, power of use, Brain Force.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.821]  You know, my wife, I'll just be totally honest, she said, you know, knockouts usually super strong.
[01:41:51.861 --> 01:41:55.302]  I've had to take two right now instead of one.
[01:41:55.322 --> 01:41:57.202]  We've got a big organic company, every lot varies.
[01:41:57.222 --> 01:41:58.783]  Some are super strong, some aren't.
[01:41:58.803 --> 01:41:59.483]  This is real stuff here.
[01:42:12.216 --> 01:42:15.760]  Alexa Pure Breeze, air purifiers, $100 off, free shipping.
[01:42:15.881 --> 01:42:16.581]  That's a huge deal.
[01:42:17.242 --> 01:42:18.444]  Throwable food, that's free shipping.
[01:42:18.864 --> 01:42:19.485]  It's all there.
[01:42:19.625 --> 01:42:21.868]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:42:22.268 --> 01:42:24.111]  And the fluoride-free toothpaste, 4-5-0-9-9, it's 50% off right now.
[01:42:24.131 --> 01:42:25.132]  But yeah, it's a deal, man.
[01:42:30.089 --> 01:42:36.251]  If you don't want high quality products, if you don't want to support the sinful war, I'm not even worried about it.
[01:42:37.271 --> 01:42:38.891]  Because I'm lined up with God.
[01:42:39.852 --> 01:42:45.013]  And I'm not lined up with the Robert Mueller and the Jerry Epstein pedophile planes.
[01:42:45.033 --> 01:42:49.074]  Can you imagine being signed up to that?
[01:42:49.194 --> 01:42:52.795]  How Mueller used them to set up thousands of politicians.
[01:42:53.935 --> 01:42:59.319]  Raping little nine, ten-year-old girls and it's all admitted in that big sack of crap thinks I'm afraid of him.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.161]  All I want to do is bring him down.
[01:43:02.382 --> 01:43:05.845]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[01:43:06.345 --> 01:43:09.127]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[01:43:09.627 --> 01:43:15.452]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:43:15.912 --> 01:43:18.675]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[01:43:19.395 --> 01:43:22.858]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[01:43:23.218 --> 01:43:29.303]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[01:43:29.704 --> 01:43:34.668]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:43:35.410 --> 01:43:38.831]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[01:43:39.332 --> 01:43:45.874]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[01:43:46.535 --> 01:43:51.217]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:43:51.757 --> 01:43:56.859]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[01:43:57.439 --> 01:44:01.421]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:44:06.042 --> 01:44:11.544]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:44:11.764 --> 01:44:19.366]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:44:19.626 --> 01:44:22.787]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:44:22.967 --> 01:44:28.070]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:30.792]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:44:31.032 --> 01:44:39.997]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:44:40.177 --> 01:44:51.784]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, Pau Darko Bark, and grape seed extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[01:44:52.024 --> 01:44:56.727]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Mico ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:56.847 --> 01:44:58.508]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:45:01.969 --> 01:45:05.171]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:05.631 --> 01:45:06.932]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:07.432 --> 01:45:18.860]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:28.565]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:45:28.965 --> 01:45:39.671]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:40.191 --> 01:45:42.513]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:45:42.833 --> 01:45:44.195]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:45:44.575 --> 01:45:54.203]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:54.304 --> 01:45:56.465]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:57.006 --> 01:46:01.870]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:46:02.811 --> 01:46:05.693]  Radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[01:46:05.993 --> 01:46:07.294]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[01:46:07.334 --> 01:46:09.035]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[01:46:09.295 --> 01:46:11.697]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[01:46:11.737 --> 01:46:12.678]  We've beaten six.
[01:46:12.978 --> 01:46:14.919]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[01:46:15.620 --> 01:46:16.340]  You're my soldier.
[01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:17.101]  We're all in this together.
[01:46:18.155 --> 01:46:22.857]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[01:46:23.277 --> 01:46:24.257]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:46:24.277 --> 01:46:35.482]  But whatever you do, the live video links on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, InfoWars.com, Word Slash Show, local stations you're listening to, every person you get to tune in to this local radio station is a victory in this war.

[01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:01.290]  Please shop with the good guys.
[01:47:06.005 --> 01:47:10.210]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.136 --> 01:47:20.621]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:47:21.222 --> 01:47:22.684]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.181]  I'm looking at a story from WorldNetDaily.com up on Infowars.com.
[01:47:29.221 --> 01:47:30.082]  I read this earlier today.
[01:47:30.102 --> 01:47:37.764]  I meant to cover it today, but illegal alien fined $280 for killing an FBI agent in fire marshal.
[01:47:37.784 --> 01:47:40.325]  And then you go, I looked at the police report.
[01:47:40.365 --> 01:47:41.105]  It's all true.
[01:47:43.306 --> 01:47:46.667]  And again, I don't care what color you are, whether you're black, white, brown, whatever.
[01:47:48.808 --> 01:47:50.248]  It's like illegal aliens.
[01:47:51.089 --> 01:47:54.150]  I had an illegal alien only like 20 miles an hour.
[01:47:55.551 --> 01:48:04.578]  It was like 16, 17 years ago, in a Wendy's parking lot, hit my truck, crushed the side door in, and the cops go, oh we can't get them, they don't have insurance, just go.
[01:48:04.999 --> 01:48:06.280]  And my insurance charged me!
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:10.583]  And I don't care, the fact is, I'm a person too!
[01:48:11.023 --> 01:48:13.225]  The illegal alien isn't allowed to just do this!
[01:48:14.626 --> 01:48:20.971]  But just like the illegal alien shot the young woman in the back, her dad held her, she died, the San Francisco jury said,
[01:48:23.208 --> 01:48:23.868]  They're letting him go.
[01:48:23.888 --> 01:48:25.329]  He's an illegal alien.
[01:48:28.230 --> 01:48:30.590]  Then you ask yourselves, what paradigm is this?
[01:48:30.630 --> 01:48:31.691]  What world is this?
[01:48:33.731 --> 01:48:39.873]  The globalists have to, in Europe and the US, incentivize free housing, free welfare, no problem.
[01:48:40.173 --> 01:48:40.613]  Come here!
[01:48:41.614 --> 01:48:42.874]  To bring the worst people!
[01:48:44.147 --> 01:48:48.191]  Not bring the good people from those countries, but bring the worst to destabilize.
[01:48:48.591 --> 01:48:50.073]  It's a military attack!
[01:48:50.353 --> 01:48:51.254]  And they admit it is!
[01:48:51.534 --> 01:48:53.476]  People go, what do you mean it's a military attack?
[01:48:54.097 --> 01:48:55.698]  A military attack means they're taking over.
[01:48:55.958 --> 01:49:00.022]  Not the people they're bringing in, but the big, powerful corporations manipulating it.
[01:49:00.603 --> 01:49:02.044]  They want to conquer you.
[01:49:02.124 --> 01:49:03.085]  It's the way of the world.
[01:49:03.346 --> 01:49:04.787]  There's always people that want to do that.
[01:49:05.448 --> 01:49:07.730]  And those of us that don't think like that are always blind to it.
[01:49:09.773 --> 01:49:11.854]  I've got a virtue signal here, but let me tell you something.
[01:49:12.154 --> 01:49:14.254]  I love people with brown skin.
[01:49:16.055 --> 01:49:20.496]  I find women with brown skin very attractive.
[01:49:20.516 --> 01:49:22.217]  The point is, it's all a fraud.
[01:49:22.237 --> 01:49:23.117]  We're all together.
[01:49:23.537 --> 01:49:31.580]  But you can't let Soros, a Nazi collaborator, blow up the whole country when he's done it to other nations and not recognize he's a bad person!
[01:49:34.943 --> 01:49:45.478]  Let's go to Denison, Kentucky, where the Senate Majority Leader just got run off another restaurant and harassed with his wife being called a Nazi, when Mitch McConnell's been the open borders guy.
[01:49:47.737 --> 01:49:50.958]  Another thing is, it's like they go, we're gonna kill Rand Paul.
[01:49:50.998 --> 01:49:51.839]  He supports Trump.
[01:49:52.499 --> 01:49:55.661]  And then he's the most anti-Trump guy when it comes to real issues.
[01:49:55.961 --> 01:49:57.761]  The only guy that brings up real issues on Trump.
[01:49:57.781 --> 01:49:59.682]  Because I'm anti-Trump on some issues.
[01:50:00.143 --> 01:50:01.523]  It's the ignorance, man.
[01:50:01.963 --> 01:50:02.744]  It's crazy.
[01:50:03.224 --> 01:50:03.984]  So let's go to Dennis.
[01:50:04.004 --> 01:50:04.985]  Go ahead, Dennis in Kentucky.
[01:50:05.025 --> 01:50:05.485]  Thanks for holding.
[01:50:06.887 --> 01:50:12.390]  Thank you so much for having me, Mr. Jones, and it's a pleasure to actually speak with you for the first time in my life.
[01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:17.392]  I usually call in when Owen is on because I know that I can actually have a fair time.
[01:50:18.513 --> 01:50:26.336]  But I will say this, on your dilemma with Mr. Joe Rogan, you owe Joe Rogan nothing.
[01:50:26.717 --> 01:50:29.038]  Joe Rogan is a fence-blinder.
[01:50:29.798 --> 01:50:31.979]  He knows where his butter is bred.
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:34.560]  He's always been that way.
[01:50:35.061 --> 01:50:35.721]  He used to be
[01:50:36.505 --> 01:50:38.407]  Well, it'd be like, it'd be like donkey balls.
[01:50:57.091 --> 01:50:57.652]  Exactly.
[01:50:58.092 --> 01:51:11.147]  So, for Joe Rogan to sit here and pretend, if you looked at his body language during that transmission you gave earlier, look how he always looked over to make sure that Jamie was giving him the yes or no nod.
[01:51:12.088 --> 01:51:14.151]  All you gotta do is just look at body language.
[01:51:14.921 --> 01:51:16.222]  That's all I can say about Joe.
[01:51:16.242 --> 01:51:17.302]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:51:17.322 --> 01:51:17.983]  Joe's my friend.
[01:51:18.003 --> 01:51:19.023]  I don't want to get in a fight with him.
[01:51:19.583 --> 01:51:22.845]  I just know that there's major web censorship going on.
[01:51:23.365 --> 01:51:26.167]  And then he continues to misrepresent what me and others are saying.
[01:51:26.627 --> 01:51:29.688]  And I just want Joe to realize, why isn't he on the winning team?
[01:51:29.708 --> 01:51:30.789]  We're going to win anyways.
[01:51:31.929 --> 01:51:33.410]  He's on the wrong side of history.
[01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:34.331]  He knows it.
[01:51:34.611 --> 01:51:39.593]  But he is being forefronted as the face of YouTube.
[01:51:39.813 --> 01:51:41.094]  You gotta realize that.
[01:51:41.815 --> 01:51:44.377]  Joe Roman is the face of you!
[01:51:44.437 --> 01:51:45.257]  No, I totally agree.
[01:51:45.338 --> 01:51:46.018]  That's my beef.
[01:51:46.078 --> 01:51:50.341]  I said that earlier live thing I did before the show, is that he doesn't get censored.
[01:51:50.841 --> 01:51:52.262]  I've called up and asked for his help.
[01:51:53.623 --> 01:51:54.984]  Not for me, but for everybody.
[01:51:55.745 --> 01:51:57.346]  And then just no response.
[01:51:57.586 --> 01:52:05.672]  All I know is, he's got Joey Diaz on there, you know, acting like we're just saying all this stuff.
[01:52:05.712 --> 01:52:10.175]  I don't want to fight with him, but God, he just continues to misrepresent what we're saying.
[01:52:11.647 --> 01:52:11.967]  Okay?
[01:52:12.428 --> 01:52:24.057]  Because he actually knows who you are, but he knows that those people have their foot on his neck about what he can say, when he can say it, and how he chooses to say it.
[01:52:24.898 --> 01:52:25.398]  It's okay.
[01:52:26.099 --> 01:52:33.845]  Mr. Jones, you have been proven throughout your track record as an upstanding citizen and a patriot for this country.
[01:52:34.226 --> 01:52:38.749]  If anyone else has anything to say about it, all they have to do is come and debate you.
[01:52:39.009 --> 01:52:39.450]  Right or wrong.
[01:52:40.922 --> 01:52:41.502]  No, I agree.
[01:52:41.542 --> 01:52:42.003]  God bless you.
[01:52:42.043 --> 01:52:42.783]  I appreciate your call.
[01:52:43.043 --> 01:52:45.925]  I just, I have a loyalty to old friends and I like Joe.
[01:52:45.945 --> 01:52:50.729]  And I just, he's got Shapiro on there and he's got all these other people.
[01:52:50.829 --> 01:52:55.352]  It's just, like saying Soros was a victim of the Nazis.
[01:52:55.392 --> 01:52:57.053]  He said he loved it, man.
[01:52:57.093 --> 01:52:58.794]  He loved rounding people up.
[01:52:59.555 --> 01:53:01.116]  And to me, that's what made me mad.
[01:53:01.136 --> 01:53:03.618]  But notice Joe in the new video doesn't defend Soros.
[01:53:03.638 --> 01:53:04.438]  So maybe that's changed.
[01:53:04.458 --> 01:53:05.859]  I don't want to get sideways with Joe.
[01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:09.642]  I just, I don't know what to say, actually.
[01:53:10.555 --> 01:53:11.536]  I don't know what to say at this point.
[01:53:11.556 --> 01:53:11.957]  God bless you.
[01:53:11.977 --> 01:53:12.558]  I appreciate your call.
[01:53:12.578 --> 01:53:14.520]  We've got a bunch of other callers here.
[01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:16.443]  We've got George in Las Vegas.
[01:53:16.503 --> 01:53:17.084]  No more Hillary.
[01:53:17.104 --> 01:53:19.287]  Let's go to George in Las Vegas and then Tony.
[01:53:19.707 --> 01:53:20.548]  George, you're on the air.
[01:53:20.588 --> 01:53:21.089]  Thanks for holding.
[01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.409]  Go ahead.
[01:53:22.711 --> 01:53:23.452]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[01:53:23.492 --> 01:53:24.634]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:25.495]  Thank you.
[01:53:26.954 --> 01:53:31.317]  I just was watching here and you announced that Hillary said she's going to be running again.
[01:53:31.637 --> 01:53:33.478]  Well, she's told her constituents she is.
[01:53:33.538 --> 01:53:35.059]  It's in the New York Post and Drudge Report.
[01:53:35.099 --> 01:53:37.540]  But she clearly wants the money that she's running.
[01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:41.522]  So she's definitely already stealing the money for the run.
[01:53:43.263 --> 01:53:43.664]  Right, right.
[01:53:43.984 --> 01:53:50.708]  It's just, you know, I was thinking this country has gotten almost tore apart by this last election.
[01:53:51.068 --> 01:53:54.530]  And it's like she's going to try to do it again and just finish the job.
[01:53:55.899 --> 01:53:57.440]  Well, that's the satanic arrogance.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.902]  I mean, I know that for a fact she had a brain tumor removed four years ago.
[01:54:01.323 --> 01:54:05.085]  She's walking dead, but it just... Yeah, she'll never... She's not gonna win.
[01:54:05.125 --> 01:54:05.765]  She's not gonna run.
[01:54:05.785 --> 01:54:06.086]  You watch.
[01:54:06.126 --> 01:54:09.128]  She'll be in a hospital or, in my opinion, dead in a couple years.
[01:54:09.508 --> 01:54:11.649]  But it just shows how the demon never stops.
[01:54:12.049 --> 01:54:13.250]  The zombie never stops.
[01:54:14.231 --> 01:54:14.431]  Right.
[01:54:14.731 --> 01:54:23.577]  And, you know, I was just thinking, hopefully with all these charges and proof that we have on her and Bill and everybody else, maybe they'll take her away before anything else happens.
[01:54:24.665 --> 01:54:42.773]  I know that Trump is playing 100% by the book, he's totally surrounded, but he's winning, and we're trying to turn the country around, but I just wish my average American knew how serious it was, because I don't owe allegiance to Trump, I owe allegiance to the truth, and it's very frustrating.
[01:54:42.793 --> 01:54:43.574]  God bless you, George.
[01:54:44.114 --> 01:54:46.855]  Alright, we got Alexander, Craig, Tony, got so many great callers.
[01:54:47.135 --> 01:54:48.756]  Tony in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:54:51.485 --> 01:54:52.425]  Hey, Tony.
[01:54:52.705 --> 01:54:53.246]  Tony's gone.
[01:54:53.746 --> 01:54:56.267]  Okay, let's go to Craig.
[01:54:56.767 --> 01:54:57.527]  Craig in Arizona.
[01:54:57.567 --> 01:54:57.947]  You're on the air.
[01:54:57.967 --> 01:54:58.467]  Thanks for holding.
[01:54:58.487 --> 01:54:58.768]  Go ahead.
[01:55:00.468 --> 01:55:01.709]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:55:02.269 --> 01:55:03.029]  I'm blessed, brother.
[01:55:03.049 --> 01:55:04.369]  I'm very humbled by all you folks.
[01:55:04.389 --> 01:55:05.350]  I appreciate you.
[01:55:06.490 --> 01:55:14.393]  I just want to take a quick moment to thank you and all the independent journalists of the world for standing up and holding the flag up at
[01:55:14.955 --> 01:55:21.800]  Fort McHenry, and keeping our flag standing, and keeping our flag going, and saving the Republic, sir.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:22.281]  Thank you.
[01:55:23.181 --> 01:55:23.982]  Well, God bless you.
[01:55:24.042 --> 01:55:25.883]  No, it truly is a fight for the country.
[01:55:26.164 --> 01:55:27.264]  That doesn't mean America's perfect.
[01:55:27.284 --> 01:55:30.407]  America's got a lot of problems, but it's based in Christianity.
[01:55:30.427 --> 01:55:32.148]  It's based in pro-human ideas.
[01:55:32.588 --> 01:55:36.111]  Not that we ever did that, but we believe in that, and that's why the enemy hates it.
[01:55:36.171 --> 01:55:38.633]  Like, look at how the evil globalists hate America.
[01:55:38.673 --> 01:55:39.694]  What does that tell you about America?
[01:55:40.885 --> 01:55:48.750]  Well, in the words of George Washington, a true patriot would rather stand on his feet than die and then surrender on his knees.
[01:55:49.871 --> 01:55:50.432]  God bless you.
[01:55:50.452 --> 01:55:50.792]  Thank you.
[01:55:50.812 --> 01:55:53.093]  All right, we'll go to Alpine, Illinois.
[01:55:53.194 --> 01:55:54.835]  Alpine, Illinois, and Alexander.
[01:55:54.915 --> 01:55:55.735]  Alexander, go ahead.
[01:55:56.596 --> 01:55:57.476]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[01:55:57.557 --> 01:55:58.377]  Pleasure to speak to you.
[01:55:58.397 --> 01:55:59.618]  Nice to talk to you, Alexander.
[01:55:59.658 --> 01:55:59.938]  Go ahead.
[01:56:00.759 --> 01:56:08.324]  So I'm new into this politics game, and I just wonder if that 9-11 thing gets fully exposed,
[01:56:09.170 --> 01:56:11.512]  I feel like that would be the trigger for the Civil War.
[01:56:12.272 --> 01:56:21.399]  But at the same time, I'm wondering, will the left beat us by infesting us with third world population before we get to that point?
[01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:23.180]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:56:24.341 --> 01:56:26.082]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[01:56:26.102 --> 01:56:31.003]  9-11 was staged with a globalist and radical Islam that has to be exposed to the deep state.
[01:56:31.343 --> 01:56:34.084]  The average third world population is a victim of globalism.
[01:56:34.504 --> 01:56:39.685]  Morally, in many cases, they are better than the average bull rot in America, be they black, white.
[01:56:40.446 --> 01:56:42.626]  It's just that they're being brainwashed as soon as they get here.
[01:56:43.006 --> 01:56:45.907]  So they're only used as a weapon, like a dam that breaks.
[01:56:46.187 --> 01:56:51.489]  If water's coming down your road to kill you, water's not bad, there's just too much of it.
[01:56:52.426 --> 01:56:57.430]  So African immigrants, Latin American immigrants, Eastern Europeans, they're not our problem.
[01:56:57.771 --> 01:57:00.953]  Except they're being brainwashed against us when they're brought in.
[01:57:01.714 --> 01:57:02.815]  So they're only a weapon.
[01:57:03.636 --> 01:57:09.721]  And so our bigger problem is the GMO, the vaccines, the globalists, their propaganda.
[01:57:10.021 --> 01:57:13.444]  If we get our country back, we can bring in 100 million, 200 million people.
[01:57:14.665 --> 01:57:16.946]  I don't care if they're black, hispanic, white, whatever.
[01:57:17.387 --> 01:57:25.271]  As long as they get a shot at being pro-America and invited in, they get in and are turned against the country the minute they get here.
[01:57:25.991 --> 01:57:29.293]  So I just want them to be shown like the different slideshow.
[01:57:29.333 --> 01:57:30.994]  Here's communism, here's freedom.
[01:57:31.294 --> 01:57:32.175]  Which one do you want?
[01:57:32.515 --> 01:57:33.415]  You've got a birthright.
[01:57:33.996 --> 01:57:35.156]  America's already brown.
[01:57:35.196 --> 01:57:38.198]  America's already... Hispanics already have the population.
[01:57:38.218 --> 01:57:38.898]  They'll be 80% in 50 years.
[01:57:40.439 --> 01:57:43.121]  Will they reject it or will they accept Americana?
[01:57:43.602 --> 01:57:45.223]  I'll see you back tomorrow, 11am central.
