[00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:22.077]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.961]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.391]  And finally, new rule, now that he's suing me for five million dollars because he says he's proved that he is not the love child of an orangutan.
[00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:53.122]  Donald Trump must learn two things, what a joke is and what a contract is.
[00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:04.169]  Let me catch you up on how all this got started.
[00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:18.317]  During the last week of the presidential campaign last year, Donald Trump, who previously... Now, the big question here is obviously, will Bill Maher of real time be fired by HBO for calling the president a racially insensitive term?
[00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:27.202]  Because if you compare someone with strawberry blonde hair to an orangutan, you're being racist against white people for comparing them to a primate.
[00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:29.584]  But of course, Bill Maher should not be fired.
[00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:39.339]  Because you could argue that Donald Trump does have orangutan colored orange hair.
[00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.200]  At least used to, he did.
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.623]  It's more gray blonde now.
[00:01:44.263 --> 00:01:45.144]  And it's a funny joke.
[00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:46.725]  When I saw it at the time, I thought it was funny.
[00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:49.748]  I've called Trump the golden toad.
[00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.671]  I've called myself a pumpkin head.
[00:01:52.691 --> 00:01:53.912]  I have a very large head.
[00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.012]  That said, this is the death of comedy.
[00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:06.157]  It's the same thing that Seinfeld's talked about, and many others, where you can't even go on universities anymore and tell basic jokes.
[00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:13.541]  Remember, Seinfeld's own 13-year-old daughter said, we're going to move back from upstate New York, our ranch, our farm, back to the cities.
[00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:14.382]  You can meet more boys.
[00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:17.284]  And his daughter said, Dad, this is two years ago.
[00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:19.225]  That's sexist to even say boy.
[00:02:20.802 --> 00:02:22.662]  That's the cultural brainwashing.
[00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:24.943]  That's the real authoritarianism here.
[00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:27.523]  And you know, I don't have a dog in the fight for Roseanne Barr.
[00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:29.704]  She's come on the show before.
[00:02:30.104 --> 00:02:31.044]  She says she's a listener.
[00:02:31.064 --> 00:02:33.665]  I think one of her personalities listens to the show.
[00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:38.986]  I think Roseanne Barr obviously is on substance abuse.
[00:02:39.806 --> 00:02:40.466]  A lot of people are.
[00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.386]  I'm not putting the lady down.
[00:02:42.427 --> 00:02:43.827]  But the point is, is that
[00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:54.782]  She's now coming out, falling on her sword, apologizing, groveling, saying, I was on Ambien, I had a bad experience.
[00:02:55.843 --> 00:02:59.306]  She says that, you know, it's rough having seven personalities.
[00:02:59.426 --> 00:03:01.548]  Roseanne Barr says she has seven personalities.
[00:03:01.568 --> 00:03:08.214]  Whether it's true or not, this whole show, I actually watched a few of the episodes, and it's exactly what I thought it was.
[00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.858]  It was a way to lure libertarian and conservative viewers back in.
[00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:23.370]  And then have a bunch of Islamists on the show and basically another Archie Bunker versus Meathead rerun to sit there and social engineer people.
[00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:27.695]  And as they added more and more political correctness in, people tuned out.
[00:03:28.216 --> 00:03:32.921]  The show spiked up, it was then sliding down, plunging into oblivion.
[00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:42.065]  And they activated their MKUltra multiple personality operative, Roseanne Barr, to then go into a complete conniption fit.
[00:03:42.365 --> 00:03:43.286]  That's really what I believe.
[00:03:43.326 --> 00:03:49.889]  I believe that she is an MKUltra mind control slave, as many people in Hollywood are, and that John Goodman is also a Martian robot.
[00:03:50.449 --> 00:04:02.075]  I'm being sarcastic, but when she's over there saying, I got seven personalities and I'm on tranquilizers, which might be true, it certainly
[00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:06.271]  Opens the door.
[00:04:06.291 --> 00:04:07.852]  Yeah, she says, I am large.
[00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:10.073]  I contain multitudes.
[00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:15.957]  Well, she has a personality that loves us that says she's going to come on all the time and then doesn't.
[00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:18.798]  So maybe it's true or maybe she's just full of prunes.
[00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:21.940]  Roseanne says having seven personalities is tough.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:32.266]  After issuing an apology, Roseanne Barr overnight slammed some of her former co-stars and retweeted defenses of her racist comments that prompted ABC to cancel her TV series.
[00:04:33.466 --> 00:04:34.487]  Is it racist?
[00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.644]  Is it racist if somebody looks simian, and humans are primates, to say it?
[00:04:43.544 --> 00:04:45.946]  I mean, I look like a gorilla with my shirt off.
[00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:48.428]  No, it's not.
[00:04:48.568 --> 00:04:49.609]  This is a political correctness.
[00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.031]  Is it racist to target blacks for abortion?
[00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:53.092]  Oh, yeah, that is.
[00:04:53.172 --> 00:04:54.433]  Or to ship drugs in their neighborhood?
[00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:55.094]  Oh, yeah, that is.
[00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:57.496]  But the left will never talk about that because they're the engineers.
[00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.038]  By the way, China's threatening to start a war with the U.S.
[00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:01.159]  We'll tell you about that when we come back.
[00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:07.567]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:10.408]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:15.070]  That's why InfoWars Life has created a powerful new addition to the Super Blue line.
[00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.391]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.

[00:06:15.923 --> 00:06:18.124]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:18.524 --> 00:06:20.225]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.487 --> 00:06:29.068]  Who is he?
[00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:39.131]  He's an absolute total tool of Chuck Schumer.
[00:06:40.912 --> 00:06:41.592]  He's a tool.
[00:06:43.642 --> 00:06:51.158]  Of Chuck Schumer, and of course, the MS-13 lover, Nancy Pelosi.
[00:06:54.002 --> 00:07:10.156]  This vicious gang has transformed once peaceful, beautiful communities that I know so well, I know them all, into blood-stained killing fields, savagely murdering, raping, and mutilating their victims.
[00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:17.903]  And this is why we call the bloodthirsty MS-13 gang members exactly the name that I used last week.
[00:07:17.943 --> 00:07:18.744]  What was the name?
[00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:21.692]  Animals.
[00:07:22.552 --> 00:07:24.573]  But in the end, Mexico's paying for the wall.
[00:07:25.714 --> 00:07:35.857]  They make all of this money, and they do absolutely nothing to stop people from going through Mexico, from Honduras, and all these other countries.
[00:07:36.217 --> 00:07:40.159]  The caravan, all of this stuff, they do nothing to help us.
[00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:40.879]  Nothing.
[00:07:41.619 --> 00:07:44.940]  They're gonna pay for the wall, and they're gonna enjoy it, okay?
[00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:46.221]  They're gonna enjoy it.
[00:07:48.462 --> 00:07:59.330]  The reason I opened the broadcast up with that today is the only place you'd see that would be either on Infowars.com or DrudgeReport.com or Fox News.
[00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:03.773]  It got blacked out all over the news with the Roseanne Barr distractions.
[00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:08.397]  A few leftist publications picked it up.
[00:08:09.938 --> 00:08:17.544]  But Mexico now has opened its border specifically for people not to stay there but to come here in a very aggressive military
[00:08:19.275 --> 00:08:19.555]  Action.
[00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:31.162]  The UN admits that they're using giant collapsing third world populations as weapons against the West to fully make us compitulate to their form of government globalism.
[00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:42.029]  Just like the Maharishi famously in the 80s shipped in over 10,000 homeless people into a tiny county in Oregon so he could outvote and take over the county.
[00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.410]  It's the same thing.
[00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:45.611]  The Democrats admit it.
[00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:49.692]  They've got 14 states letting illegal aliens get driver's licenses and vote.
[00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:52.353]  The Democrats are now telling illegals to vote.
[00:08:53.633 --> 00:08:54.674]  Nobody would put up with this.
[00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:58.355]  So I open the broadcast up that Trump is continuing to try to defend our republic.
[00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:14.227]  He's pressuring the Democrats with very, very fair immigration deals to make it easier to become a citizen, easier to come in if you're not a criminal, easier for people that actually are real dreamers and have lived here for a long time and aren't criminals and contribute to become citizens, to be fast-tracked.
[00:09:14.247 --> 00:09:26.391]  But if you're criminals or you're MS-13 or you've got serious convictions, you are going to have your criminal butt, whether you're from Europe or whether you're from Asia or whether you're from Latin America, thrown out of here.
[00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:31.155]  The media has branded controlling our borders a Hispanic thing because that was the majority.
[00:09:31.555 --> 00:09:32.876]  It's now Chinese women.
[00:09:33.837 --> 00:09:40.062]  For three years running, Chinese women are the number one group here illegally week by week.
[00:09:40.703 --> 00:09:42.284]  And they come here to have their babies for free.
[00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:50.511]  They fly in the last month, the government knows it, they get in a hotel, they go have the baby, everything's paid for, and that baby's now a U.S.
[00:09:50.531 --> 00:09:51.913]  citizen and gets benefits.
[00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:54.495]  And it's middle-class Chinese doing it.
[00:09:56.041 --> 00:10:02.183]  It's crazy, you go up to the domain in North Austin, and sometimes a third of the people you'll see are pregnant Chinese women.
[00:10:03.303 --> 00:10:15.967]  Don't speak a lick of English, and they're up there, they're shopping, they're enjoying themselves, they've got an apartment, they're right next to the big women's center that's right down the road there, where my wife just had our baby a year ago, and they are milking the systems.
[00:10:17.507 --> 00:10:18.008]  There it is.
[00:10:20.728 --> 00:10:23.509]  China, now the biggest group.
[00:10:23.969 --> 00:10:24.590]  So it's a joke.
[00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.510]  Now you go to China,
[00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:32.622]  And you try that, they will put you in a forced labor camp, or they will execute you, and they will take your organs.
[00:10:33.483 --> 00:10:36.883]  But see, just like the EU filing suit on thousands of U.S.
[00:10:36.923 --> 00:10:48.766]  companies claiming that we abused people's data, which in many cases is true, the EU basically exempts itself, and China hasn't had one suit filed on them.
[00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:55.823]  It's China and the EU ganged up on us, and I keep going back to that because how can leftists not join with the fight for America?
[00:10:56.284 --> 00:11:01.810]  When everything Trump's doing is pragmatically Eisenhower meets JFK.
[00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:09.359]  It's just standard, turn the economy on, go after corruption, kick out most of the lobbyists, nothing's perfect.
[00:11:10.646 --> 00:11:23.050]  And just follow an economic policy that's good for the country and good for the world but not good for ultra-rich people worth hundreds of billions of dollars like Bezos and Slim and Gates and Buffett and all the rest of these people.
[00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:32.854]  They are above the law and they are at war with free economies and they are at war with the West because they are monopoly men and they want total consolidation.
[00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.232]  Trump is a renaissance guy.
[00:11:37.312 --> 00:11:38.733]  He's a capitalist.
[00:11:38.773 --> 00:11:40.073]  He is a entertainer.
[00:11:40.393 --> 00:11:44.414]  He is somebody that wants largess and wants big, juicy economies.
[00:11:45.494 --> 00:11:46.674]  So he can skim off the top.
[00:11:47.475 --> 00:11:48.535]  In a legal and lawful way.
[00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:52.176]  Not off some skimming to take it, you know, some business.
[00:11:53.496 --> 00:11:55.776]  Riding in on the return of America.
[00:11:56.416 --> 00:11:57.077]  A big hit.
[00:11:57.377 --> 00:11:58.397]  A big cornucopia.
[00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:00.037]  The ghost of Christmas present.
[00:12:01.578 --> 00:12:02.918]  Big, beautiful orangutan.
[00:12:03.834 --> 00:12:07.935]  But remember, Bill Maher can call him an orangutan, and Bill Maher is not going to get his show cancelled.
[00:12:09.655 --> 00:12:11.016]  But Roseanne Barr, you can see it.
[00:12:11.056 --> 00:12:13.496]  They set her up, brought in the new show.
[00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:17.477]  It was really an anti-conservative program, the pieces I saw of it.
[00:12:18.257 --> 00:12:19.198]  Luring people in.
[00:12:23.779 --> 00:12:26.399]  It's simply amazing.
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.601]  They could call George W. Bush a chimpanzee, a monkey, over and over again.
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.842]  If you're a TV viewer, we've got the meme on screen.
[00:12:35.862 --> 00:12:36.582]  Let's go back to that.
[00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:53.234]  You got Valerie Jarrett that doesn't completely look like the chimpanzee scientist lady from the first excellent Charlton Heston Planet of the Apes movie.
[00:12:54.354 --> 00:12:57.536]  She looks more like a toad or a snapping turtle.
[00:12:58.277 --> 00:12:59.458]  More like a fish creature.
[00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.851]  Now, Trump doesn't really look like an orangutan other than the orangutan color of his hair.
[00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:09.473]  It's dead on back when he was just, I guess, dyeing it with Just For Men or whatever.
[00:13:09.693 --> 00:13:10.893]  Reportedly, that's what that color is.
[00:13:11.793 --> 00:13:18.696]  Okay, yes, Trump does make chimpanzee-like or orangutan-like lip faces because humans do that.
[00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:25.538]  And they've got studies how humans with the same emotions make the same faces as great apes.
[00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:29.199]  Chimpanzees.
[00:13:31.673 --> 00:13:31.893]  Apes.
[00:13:33.314 --> 00:13:33.894]  Orangutans.
[00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:36.355]  And you can see the comparisons.
[00:13:36.395 --> 00:13:39.276]  They teach that in sociology, psychology, anthropology.
[00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:39.776]  It's well known.
[00:13:40.196 --> 00:13:45.438]  So, if you compare some black lady to looking simian, well, there's a reason.
[00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:47.759]  Because we are primates.
[00:13:48.905 --> 00:13:53.507]  That's why there's so many comparisons to humans and monkeys and to apes.
[00:13:54.187 --> 00:13:57.449]  Because some people look more like it than others.
[00:13:57.689 --> 00:14:00.350]  There are some white people that look more like apes than other white people.
[00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.031]  There are some black people that look more ape-like than other black people.
[00:14:03.932 --> 00:14:04.732]  I look ape-like.
[00:14:05.393 --> 00:14:11.335]  With my shirt off, you know, in my birthday suit, I look like a gorilla.
[00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:13.776]  I mean, I have to work out.
[00:14:13.836 --> 00:14:16.117]  I got big chest, big arms, big legs.
[00:14:16.398 --> 00:14:17.058]  I'm bow-legged.
[00:14:18.476 --> 00:14:19.357]  My feet are flat.
[00:14:23.119 --> 00:14:24.760]  My dad is somewhat simian looking, too.
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.341]  It's just the way it is.
[00:14:27.401 --> 00:14:28.001]  And I'm proud of it.
[00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:33.144]  But... I mean, this whole thing is just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:14:33.204 --> 00:14:34.445]  I'm hairy like an ape, too.
[00:14:35.646 --> 00:14:36.466]  By the way, I'm proud of it.
[00:14:37.267 --> 00:14:38.207]  Women don't seem to mind.
[00:14:38.227 --> 00:14:38.948]  They seem to like it.
[00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:44.151]  So... I would say...
[00:14:46.263 --> 00:14:49.064]  That I look more Simeon than most black people.
[00:14:49.845 --> 00:15:00.069]  But this mental illness of political correctness to say that we don't all, at one way or another, look Simeon is just a complete joke.
[00:15:00.089 --> 00:15:02.890]  I mean, it's like species of horses.
[00:15:03.911 --> 00:15:06.512]  Does a mule look a lot like a horse, even though it's not a horse?
[00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:08.273]  Does a donkey look a lot like a horse?
[00:15:08.313 --> 00:15:10.574]  It's a different species, but it's in the same family.
[00:15:12.674 --> 00:15:18.698]  So if you're watching on TV, you can see that footage they did where I did a whole joke deal where I decided I supported Hillary and I'm ripping my shirt off.
[00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.640]  And I look semi in there.
[00:15:23.441 --> 00:15:24.541]  But this is the mental illness.
[00:15:24.581 --> 00:15:25.542]  This is what they've pushed.
[00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:28.984]  This is what they've said where they can decide who's fired, who's taken off the air.
[00:15:29.044 --> 00:15:36.709]  And that sets the precedent, monkey see, monkey do, where then all of us are watching television and we think, oh, let's reenact that in our own lives.
[00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:39.731]  It's incredible.
[00:15:40.692 --> 00:15:42.994]  I call my own little daughter, my little monkey.
[00:15:43.655 --> 00:15:44.576]  She hangs onto my fingers.
[00:15:45.356 --> 00:15:45.877]  And you know what?
[00:15:45.937 --> 00:15:47.638]  She looks like a cute little pink monkey.
[00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:50.321]  So this is the mental illness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:51.102 --> 00:15:51.942]  And it's out of control.
[00:15:51.962 --> 00:15:54.965]  So are they going to fire anybody that compares white people to apes?
[00:15:55.926 --> 00:15:56.807]  No, it's not going to happen.
[00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:01.111]  They'll be back with Russia and China and major threats.
[00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:12.568]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[00:16:12.788 --> 00:16:20.412]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[00:16:20.652 --> 00:16:23.813]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[00:16:23.993 --> 00:16:31.797]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[00:16:32.037 --> 00:16:41.041]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:52.808]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including Grapefruit Seed Extract, Pal Darko Bark, and Grape Seed Extract, our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[00:16:53.048 --> 00:16:57.751]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:16:57.871 --> 00:16:59.532]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.461]  I'm so excited.
[00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:14.088]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[00:17:14.668 --> 00:17:19.852]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic, that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[00:17:20.173 --> 00:17:22.975]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:17:23.195 --> 00:17:31.942]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:17:34.063 --> 00:17:38.847]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:42.129]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:53.138]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:17:53.658 --> 00:17:54.959]  It is amazing!
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:01.324]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:18:02.964 --> 00:18:05.626]  We're going to continue to stand up for America.
[00:18:06.026 --> 00:18:11.170]  We are going to call BS on the mainstream media when they lie.
[00:18:11.851 --> 00:18:14.773]  This is the essence of InfoWars.
[00:18:15.214 --> 00:18:18.736]  This is why your trip to the InfoWars store is so vitally important.
[00:18:19.357 --> 00:18:30.626]  You see, we don't have any right-wing industrialists or multi-billionaires standing in the wings writing big checks to Alex Jones to subsidize our work here at InfoWars.
[00:18:31.266 --> 00:18:42.016]  We have to depend on the individual InfoWarrior, on men and women out there who believe in freedom, who believe in liberty, and believe in the message that we are delivering.
[00:18:42.316 --> 00:18:47.741]  You can support us by going to the InfoWar store and loading up on some of these terrific products.
[00:18:48.082 --> 00:18:51.345]  Take a look at our t-shirts, our books.
[00:18:51.885 --> 00:18:53.347]  It's a 360 win.
[00:18:53.687 --> 00:18:56.810]  When you buy the Super Blue Silver Moon Gargle,
[00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.971]  You're helping the fight for freedom.
[00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.611]  So please go to the site now.
[00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:02.692]  We need your support.
[00:19:03.112 --> 00:19:06.013]  Western Europe has already banned free speech.
[00:19:06.173 --> 00:19:10.335]  And an iron curtain of censorship is descending down over the UK.
[00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:18.258]  They're set to pass rules, not a law, that if you criticize Islam or gays, you'll get six months in prison.
[00:19:18.658 --> 00:19:21.739]  We know we're only about a year or two behind what's happening in the UK.
[00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:26.641]  CNN and many others are calling for InfoWars to be shut down, taken off the web.
[00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:30.942]  Slate Magazine has a professor and others saying, go beyond censorship.
[00:19:31.142 --> 00:19:33.883]  Brainwash young people against InfoWars.
[00:19:34.283 --> 00:19:38.445]  Psychologically inoculate them with lies, so they don't actually hear what we have to say.
[00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:42.066]  We are the most hated news source in the world by globalists.
[00:19:42.506 --> 00:19:57.352]  It is so critical that you go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up for the free newsletter so we can be in contact with you and so the censors can't bully their way in and block us being able to engage in free open dialogue as a society.
[00:19:57.592 --> 00:19:58.892]  That is critical to this fight.
[00:19:59.132 --> 00:20:01.453]  We will prevail if you take action and I know you will.
[00:20:06.397 --> 00:20:10.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.629 --> 00:20:15.511]  Drugged out!
[00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:18.435]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:20:19.574 --> 00:20:21.816]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:23.917]  Today, it all changes.
[00:20:24.238 --> 00:20:26.680]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.842]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:20:30.082 --> 00:20:34.566]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[00:20:34.806 --> 00:20:37.688]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, f*** you, f*** you, f*** you.
[00:20:37.948 --> 00:20:39.990]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.271]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:20:42.752 --> 00:20:44.173]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:20:44.393 --> 00:20:45.514]  We have the resources.
[00:20:48.598 --> 00:20:52.380]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherf***ers to change something.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.502]  Steve Jobs is crazy, now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:20:55.542 --> 00:20:59.904]  They say Trump's crazy, they say I'm crazy, but I'm here to show love.
[00:21:00.084 --> 00:21:03.706]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:21:05.227 --> 00:21:08.789]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:21:09.369 --> 00:21:11.130]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:21:17.848 --> 00:21:18.989]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:27.435]  Coming up the next segment, I'm going to get into Senators seek stronger action on China and South China Sea.
[00:21:28.015 --> 00:21:30.717]  China is now threatening military action against our ships.
[00:21:30.757 --> 00:21:32.058]  That means war.
[00:21:33.338 --> 00:21:35.140]  That is a huge issue.
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.381]  Also, Soros has thrown a big fit.
[00:21:38.382 --> 00:21:39.583]  Everything has gone wrong.
[00:21:39.683 --> 00:21:42.745]  Soros warns major financial crisis is coming.
[00:21:43.365 --> 00:21:45.367]  When he's the one that's famous for engineering,
[00:21:46.263 --> 00:22:13.105]  Financial crises and I'm also at the start of the next segment gonna air the definitive clip Of Soros on NPR and Soros on 60 minutes and other programs saying the best time of his life Was going around with his father While his stepfather rounded up the Jews and now he feels no guilt for it and then he's attacking Roseanne Barr For pointing it out.
[00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.787]  I think that's the real reason she got canned
[00:22:17.537 --> 00:22:20.778]  Now here's what you really need to know about Roseanne Barr.
[00:22:21.878 --> 00:22:29.220]  Roseanne Barr is extremely... Here's what you need to know about Roseanne Barr.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.881]  Roseanne Barr is extremely eccentric.
[00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:40.743]  Roseanne Barr was basically picked.
[00:22:41.843 --> 00:22:52.694]  By the corporate media who have imploding ratings to come on television and launch a conservative quasi-reboot.
[00:22:55.576 --> 00:22:58.539]  But as soon as the show launched it began to just be a
[00:22:59.602 --> 00:23:13.347]  Sucker punch or a sucker play where they lured people back into the top rated show to get viewers back into ABC and then they baited and switched it from the episodes I watched and it had more social justice warrior stuff.
[00:23:13.847 --> 00:23:17.808]  It had more pro open border Islamic crap than anything you can imagine.
[00:23:17.868 --> 00:23:22.230]  So we praise it as this great conservative program and this trailblazing thing.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:47.133]  When Roseanne is the token free thinker, she's the token open-minded person, and then she's billed as a crazy person, she's billed as a substance abuser, she's billed as a person with multiple personalities, and so we hail mainstream media and say thank you so much for giving us a voice in mainstream news and mainstream sitcoms.
[00:23:48.034 --> 00:23:49.194]  That's right, sitcoms.
[00:23:49.775 --> 00:23:51.636]  Let us tune in to your fraud.
[00:23:53.191 --> 00:24:00.274]  And let us buy into it, and let us feel like we've got a seat at the table, when all you're doing is laughing at us and suckering us.
[00:24:01.034 --> 00:24:05.316]  And then when Roseanne gets a little bit off the reservation, you ignore it.
[00:24:05.656 --> 00:24:19.983]  But as soon as the ratings start to plunge, from record ratings in the last four or five years, for any other show out there, to only a decent show, with a trajectory showing it going straight down,
[00:24:21.294 --> 00:24:45.313]  Well then the controversy you've been pushing her to engage in, well the last stage of the setup was brought in and ABC bragged to CNN, an article I read this morning, that they were already looking at cancelling the show because of her activities, that they were proud of how quick they took action and how they flushed her so quickly because they're not going to put up with hate.
[00:24:45.554 --> 00:24:47.175]  They're going to virtue signal just like
[00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:53.245]  Major Fortune 100 companies, like Starbucks.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:25:17.291]  Starbucks is admittedly being funded by the Open Society Foundation and George Soros, that's the main funder of the PR group, in their own press release, along with the Ford Foundation, running the whole, oh, we're racist, we're gonna close our doors for a few days to be a re-education camp, and then we're gonna ask every white patron that comes in, are you a racist?
[00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:21.213]  Would you virtue signal today and tell a black person you're sorry?
[00:25:21.393 --> 00:25:22.814]  Will you take on some guilt?
[00:25:24.602 --> 00:25:32.347]  This is being pushed as divide and conquer from the people up on the top of the pyramid to control those at the bottom of the pyramid.
[00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:33.528]  It's simple.
[00:25:33.888 --> 00:25:34.829]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:36.590]  It's called social engineering.
[00:25:37.451 --> 00:25:38.652]  It's called divide and conquer.
[00:25:38.972 --> 00:25:40.073]  It's called balkanization.
[00:25:41.343 --> 00:25:46.084]  Now the truth about Roseanne Barr was, as soon as she made the statement, she apologized.
[00:25:46.104 --> 00:25:51.325]  Because in the past, they would let her apologize for publicity, but this time, they were ready to get rid of her.
[00:25:51.666 --> 00:25:52.146]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:53.346]  If you're watching on TV.
[00:25:53.566 --> 00:25:54.766]  The Perception Institute.
[00:25:55.126 --> 00:25:58.827]  Research, representation, reality.
[00:25:58.947 --> 00:26:00.088]  That means controlling reality.
[00:26:00.848 --> 00:26:02.148]  And who was one of their main funders?
[00:26:02.188 --> 00:26:04.949]  Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundation.
[00:26:05.905 --> 00:26:11.587]  That's all divide-and-conquer, race-war garbage, and so are the other organizations.
[00:26:12.187 --> 00:26:22.331]  Why are the ultra-rich, why are the super-blue-bloods that only marry other white people, who only allow Oprah Winfrey into their eugenics meetings that are even in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times?
[00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:23.572]  Remember six years ago?
[00:26:24.772 --> 00:26:29.174]  The world's richest meet in secret to establish a world government for depopulation.
[00:26:29.474 --> 00:26:33.636]  Just type in, the world's richest meet in New York to discuss depopulation.
[00:26:35.225 --> 00:26:37.506]  ABC News, London Guardian, you name it.
[00:26:37.566 --> 00:26:39.786]  Six years ago, they tried a coming out.
[00:26:40.886 --> 00:26:43.567]  They said David Rockefeller, Ted Turner, Bill Gates.
[00:26:45.187 --> 00:27:02.991]  They're all there with Oprah Winfrey, the one black lady, meeting in secret in New York, and then they put out a press release admitting, we're establishing world government, and we're going to shrink your population, and we're going to teach you how to fight with each other, and we're going to bring down the first world because we shouldn't have a middle class, only a super elite.
[00:27:04.571 --> 00:27:17.322]  These guys all run global scams where they pay basically zero taxes, all their money's tax-exempt, and they get called philanthropists while they lecture all of us about how we're bad and how we shouldn't have a middle class.
[00:27:18.222 --> 00:27:30.713]  And they also work around the clock to shut down any small businesses or any regional businesses or factories and de-industrialize the West to bring us to our knees so they can dictate to us the terms of our total surrender.
[00:27:33.507 --> 00:27:36.508]  And then once they've got you under their control, they can dictate inoculations.
[00:27:36.808 --> 00:27:38.389]  They can dictate number of children you can have.
[00:27:38.609 --> 00:27:39.809]  They can dictate total control.
[00:27:40.009 --> 00:27:50.673]  But first, they're going to let the third world population run rampant until we approve a global fascist order that will then exterminate, with race-specific bio-weapons, the entire third world.
[00:27:52.113 --> 00:27:53.154]  Now that's the real plan!
[00:27:53.634 --> 00:27:58.816]  And that's why they hate me, because I've reverse-engineered their own documents, their own admissions, their own plans.
[00:27:59.316 --> 00:28:02.217]  Now, if you want to stop this and you want to fight back,
[00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:07.272]  It is absolutely critical that you understand what we're really dealing with here.
[00:28:07.773 --> 00:28:10.495]  And you don't defeat these people by apologizing or by groveling.
[00:28:10.515 --> 00:28:14.059]  They want to bring in a total climate of witch hunt and fear, where we all roll over.
[00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:17.862]  If you want to stop them, you spread the word, you tell the truth.
[00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:21.326]  You don't care if you get criticized sharing a newswars.com link.
[00:28:21.566 --> 00:28:25.590]  You don't care if your family gets in your face when you promote Americana and Donald Trump.
[00:28:26.624 --> 00:28:34.809]  And Trump, under all the attack, has broken through their conditioning, through their control, through their bullying, through their demonization, and things are getting better right away.
[00:28:34.829 --> 00:28:38.952]  And so that's why they're panicking more now, going, well, we can bully Alex Jones.
[00:28:39.432 --> 00:28:41.213]  Or we can bully somebody else then.
[00:28:41.293 --> 00:28:43.595]  We can bully Roseanne, and then we can bully you!
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:46.962]  So Trump has broken through.
[00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:49.806]  He's the model to show how he broke through the lies.
[00:28:49.846 --> 00:28:51.628]  The American people voted for him and broke through the lies.
[00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:53.310]  They bet on something different.
[00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.991]  It's working.
[00:28:54.392 --> 00:28:57.756]  The globalists are panicking, so they're tripling down on race war garbage.
[00:28:58.297 --> 00:28:59.699]  Please support the transmission.
[00:28:59.959 --> 00:29:00.841]  Please spread the links.
[00:29:06.295 --> 00:29:18.138]  One of the reasons that your audience is so awakened and so able to process information is because your health products actually greatly enhance neurological and cognitive function.
[00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:28.120]  This is something that I've been noticing that, you know, people who live on junk foods and processed foods and take medications and go in and out of the pharmacy, they're dumbed down and they're easy for the globalists to control.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.141]  You get on turmeric, like your body's product, and you've got the nootropics and all these other products.
[00:29:33.661 --> 00:29:42.948]  What happens is people, it takes a couple of months, but all the clouds start clearing out of their heads, the cobwebs go away, and they start being able to see with clarity what's happening in the world.
[00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:48.511]  Like, you're giving people the information to wake them up, and the nutrition to wake them up.
[00:29:48.531 --> 00:29:50.073]  I mean, the brain's a physical organ.
[00:29:50.673 --> 00:29:56.997]  The brain has to physically and biochemically work before the brain can process the information that you're downloading to people.
[00:29:57.017 --> 00:29:57.798]  Here's my problem.
[00:29:58.318 --> 00:30:06.746]  When I do take the bodies and the exituant things, I'm already so crazed and focused that then I see everything so clear, I tend to get mad.
[00:30:07.146 --> 00:30:08.307]  I have the same issue.
[00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:08.748]  Yeah.
[00:30:09.368 --> 00:30:12.191]  Because then you're just like, ahh!
[00:30:12.451 --> 00:30:13.952]  But that's better than being in a coma.
[00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:19.937]  And they admit neurological disorders are exploding, IQs are dropping, people are in trance-like states.
[00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:22.419]  This is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:30:22.439 --> 00:30:25.521]  And I'm glad you mentioned that because bodies have just come back in.
[00:30:25.702 --> 00:30:29.244]  It's 25% off and this has a 95 curcumin in level.
[00:30:29.525 --> 00:30:31.106]  We went out with the top labs.
[00:30:31.146 --> 00:30:33.488]  We want the strongest concentrate.
[00:30:34.228 --> 00:30:38.512]  Of it out there, and Mike, you've tested the products, you've studied the products, you've looked at the products.
[00:30:38.832 --> 00:30:43.736]  You were saying that you really like bodies, and you think it's a top of the line turmeric product, and there's so much research on turmeric.
[00:30:44.136 --> 00:30:45.257]  It's just incredible.
[00:30:45.417 --> 00:30:54.384]  This is the product that I like the most in your store because turmeric and curcuminoids have the most universal positive effect on the body and the mind.
[00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:55.465]  This is key.
[00:30:55.485 --> 00:30:59.389]  You know, inflammation is a systemic problem, and you have inflammation of the brain.
[00:30:59.449 --> 00:31:00.970]  They call that something down the road.
[00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:03.452]  I can't use disease names here because of FDA regulations.
[00:31:03.852 --> 00:31:05.453]  You have inflammation of the cells.
[00:31:05.494 --> 00:31:07.015]  They call that something else down the road.
[00:31:07.035 --> 00:31:12.439]  By the way, I've had Dr. Blaylock and other top brain surgeons on and they say it's inflammation in the brain.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.502]  That's why you've got Alzheimer's at age 30 now.
[00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:16.303]  That's exactly right.
[00:31:16.663 --> 00:31:22.288]  Now, your product is an extract and we've done heavy metals testing on all the turmeric products.
[00:31:22.528 --> 00:31:26.992]  We've done over a thousand foods and supplements through our lab using ICP-MS mass spec testing.
[00:31:27.572 --> 00:31:30.774]  When you do the extract, it leaves all the heavy metals behind.
[00:31:30.814 --> 00:31:36.538]  The heavy metals stay in the root, so the turmeric root has lead in it, some lead.
[00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:38.259]  Well, that's another reason.
[00:31:38.299 --> 00:31:45.284]  But the top lab we ended up using to make this said that, they said, listen, you want to go with the more expensive extract anyways, because then you can't pass the metals test if you don't.
[00:31:45.424 --> 00:31:45.824]  Exactly.
[00:31:45.984 --> 00:31:52.869]  So anyway, what I really noticed was that it's this combination that you're providing people the information to awaken them and the nutrition.
[00:31:53.209 --> 00:31:57.672]  Because if you're living on junk foods, folks, you're not going to be able to wake up and process the information.
[00:32:02.517 --> 00:32:04.278]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:33:06.444 --> 00:33:09.085]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:13.593 --> 00:33:19.395]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life, that year of German occupation.
[00:33:19.455 --> 00:33:21.496]  For me it was a very positive experience.
[00:33:21.576 --> 00:33:30.900]  It's a strange thing, you know, because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are in considerable danger yourself.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.401]  But you're 14 years old and you don't believe.
[00:33:35.462 --> 00:33:36.442]  You're a...
[00:34:03.899 --> 00:34:04.259]  I don't know.
[00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:19.502]  Lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[00:34:19.562 --> 00:34:19.863]  Right.
[00:34:20.423 --> 00:34:21.584]  I was 14 years old.
[00:34:22.444 --> 00:34:24.966]  And I would say that that's when my character was made.
[00:34:25.446 --> 00:34:25.947]  In what way?
[00:34:26.367 --> 00:34:31.270]  That one should think ahead, one should understand and anticipate events.
[00:34:32.651 --> 00:34:35.733]  And one is threatened.
[00:34:36.174 --> 00:34:38.175]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[00:34:38.295 --> 00:34:41.077]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[00:34:41.557 --> 00:34:49.782]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted god son.
[00:34:49.802 --> 00:34:50.302]  Yes, yes.
[00:34:51.223 --> 00:34:54.605]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[00:34:54.785 --> 00:34:55.265]  That's right.
[00:34:56.226 --> 00:34:56.546]  Yes.
[00:34:57.126 --> 00:35:06.052]  I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[00:35:06.992 --> 00:35:10.375]  Was it difficult?
[00:35:10.955 --> 00:35:11.495]  Not at all.
[00:35:11.796 --> 00:35:12.396]  Not at all.
[00:35:13.137 --> 00:35:22.724]  Maybe as a child you don't see the connection, but it created no problem at all.
[00:35:22.784 --> 00:35:23.684]  No feeling of guilt?
[00:35:24.065 --> 00:35:24.225]  No.
[00:35:24.625 --> 00:35:32.791]  For example, I'm Jewish and here I am watching these people go, I could just as easily be there, I should be there.
[00:35:33.211 --> 00:35:33.652]  None of that.
[00:35:34.392 --> 00:35:43.341]  Well, of course I could be on the other side, or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away.
[00:35:47.446 --> 00:35:53.732]  But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there, because that was...
[00:35:58.236 --> 00:36:10.781]  Well, actually, funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, of course I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[00:36:11.722 --> 00:36:16.424]  Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away.
[00:36:17.464 --> 00:36:21.006]  So I had no role in taking away that property.
[00:36:21.946 --> 00:36:23.226]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[00:36:23.707 --> 00:36:24.347]  Are you religious?
[00:36:27.312 --> 00:36:27.952]  Do you believe in God?
[00:36:28.793 --> 00:36:28.933]  No.
[00:36:29.893 --> 00:36:34.655]  You may have heard that Starbucks is closing up shop today to implement mandatory implicit bias training.
[00:36:35.295 --> 00:36:42.378]  The move will cost an estimated $12 million in lost revenue, and critics say that it amounts to no more than virtue signaling.
[00:36:42.898 --> 00:36:48.260]  What's worse, experts claim that when you mandate this type of training, it actually does more harm than good.
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.982]  So why would Starbucks go through with such a controversial move when it's costly and ineffective?
[00:36:54.181 --> 00:37:01.296]  Meet the Perception Institute, a think tank with the goal of propping up intersectionality, which is at the cornerstone of the liberal thought plantation.
[00:37:02.182 --> 00:37:02.742]  Here's the kicker.
[00:37:03.203 --> 00:37:12.188]  The Perception Institute is supported by, you guessed it, the George Soros Open Society Foundation, as well as another globalist foundation, the Ford Foundation.
[00:37:12.789 --> 00:37:16.091]  Now that we're able to follow the money, we can see exactly how the story turns.
[00:37:17.112 --> 00:37:23.676]  The Perception Institute has partnered with Starbucks to set the precedent for other companies to mandate this type of training and make it a cultural norm.
[00:37:24.516 --> 00:37:31.121]  If this is something you're opposed to, try supporting a local coffee shop, where you can check out more reports like these at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:31.718 --> 00:37:32.599]  Matt Weber reporting.
[00:37:35.781 --> 00:37:38.623]  And that's how it all ties together, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:39.164 --> 00:37:47.269]  If you look at who's on the board of Starbucks, she's also some of the ladies on the board with Oprah Winfrey's big global depopulation group.
[00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:59.959]  Oprah Winfrey, of course, has been in mainstream news, meeting secretly with the Global Eugenics Board with David Rockefeller and Ted Turner, Bill Gates, and others, and she is for global depopulation.
[00:38:03.857 --> 00:38:05.778]  And so, what was Roseanne's big crime?
[00:38:05.818 --> 00:38:16.724]  Well, it was tweeting that George Soros was a Nazi collaborator, something George Soros responded to and said was false, and the media dutifully yesterday said that he's actually a Holocaust survivor.
[00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:24.468]  Well, I guess he did survive the Holocaust by being a collaborator and helping actively with his uncle round up Jews.
[00:38:24.989 --> 00:38:28.951]  We just played him earlier saying it, but saying he felt no guilt.
[00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:32.624]  Because it's like markets, he just filled that slot.
[00:38:33.066 --> 00:38:33.869]  Speaking of eugenics...
[00:38:35.095 --> 00:38:41.600]  It was Thomas Watson who received the highest award ever given during the reign of the Nazis from 1933 to 1945.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:53.210]  He won the highest award ever given to anyone in the Reich for international business machines running the Hollerith machines in the slave camps and in the death camps.
[00:38:53.230 --> 00:39:02.137]  So the tattoos were numbers to track you to put into that how long you'd worked, how much you'd be fed, would you be right away killed or gotten rid of, or how long you'd be worked to death.
[00:39:03.206 --> 00:39:04.267]  That's an absolute fact.
[00:39:05.228 --> 00:39:12.594]  And IBM now has a computer named Thomas that is their main AI system that is running most hospitals in Europe and the U.S.
[00:39:13.215 --> 00:39:17.698]  on their bioethics boards deciding who lives and who dies.
[00:39:18.703 --> 00:39:19.123]  That's right.
[00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:22.906]  So that's the new AI deciding who lives and who dies.
[00:39:23.567 --> 00:39:24.668]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:39:24.688 --> 00:39:28.090]  If that's your right to death, it's actually the government's right to kill you.
[00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:32.754]  I'm all for somebody's right if they don't want to seek treatment or, you know, don't want to go through pain anymore.
[00:39:32.954 --> 00:39:41.260]  But this is the state coming in saying, no, we're going to decide who lives and who dies with our bioethics boards programming the computers so no one has any guilt when they kill people.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:47.885]  Well, President Trump just finished, minutes ago, live, this is in near time, signing the right
[00:39:48.888 --> 00:39:51.289]  Not the right to live, the right to try.
[00:39:52.149 --> 00:40:00.332]  All these thousands of drugs and things that are known to help people who are terminal live longer, maybe even save them, those are being held up by the drug companies and by government.
[00:40:00.592 --> 00:40:04.934]  Trump just, as he promised to innovate in the State of the Union, he just innovated massively.
[00:40:04.954 --> 00:40:05.514]  Let's go to that.
[00:40:06.334 --> 00:40:10.597]  He said that this puts the access in the hands of all of Americans who are terminally ill.
[00:40:11.078 --> 00:40:14.441]  Some groups, like the American Cancer Society, have pushed against this.
[00:40:14.841 --> 00:40:22.647]  Some Democrats have pushed against it, saying that it puts those patients, who again are terminally ill, at risk.
[00:40:23.228 --> 00:40:24.889]  The FDA may not have vetted this drug.
[00:40:24.929 --> 00:40:26.650]  The American Cancer Society runs the cancer.
[00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.112]  They developed the cancer viruses in the vaccine.
[00:40:29.132 --> 00:40:30.473]  Let's watch and listen together.
[00:40:30.513 --> 00:40:34.216]  To me, this is a very important moment, a very important day.
[00:40:35.077 --> 00:40:39.879]  I've been looking forward to this for a long time, along with Senator Ron Johnson.
[00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:42.560]  And I will tell you, we worked hard on this.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.180]  I never understood why it was hard.
[00:40:45.121 --> 00:40:46.881]  They've been trying to have it passed for years.
[00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:48.482]  I never understood why.
[00:40:49.701 --> 00:40:55.465]  Because I'd see people, friends of mine, and other people I'd read about, where they'd travel all over the world looking for a cure.
[00:40:56.505 --> 00:41:07.132]  And we have the best medical people in the world, but we have trials, and we have long time, 12 years, 15 years, even when things look really promising, so many years.
[00:41:08.273 --> 00:41:11.115]  And I never understood why they didn't do this, and we worked very hard.
[00:41:11.295 --> 00:41:18.420]  We're going to come back with more of this on the other side, because this is a near time, the speech is still ongoing.
[00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:23.900]  It is a fact that they have suppressed thousands of treatments.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.141]  I don't want to call them cures, but in some cases it cures people.
[00:41:27.261 --> 00:41:29.962]  And all we get is 50-year-old bug poison.
[00:41:30.462 --> 00:41:31.723]  They call it chemotherapy.
[00:41:32.443 --> 00:41:35.304]  And then they suck everything out of you.
[00:41:35.324 --> 00:41:37.005]  And the doctors aren't allowed to get the new treatments.
[00:41:37.205 --> 00:41:38.246]  They're blocking it all.
[00:41:38.266 --> 00:41:42.307]  This is the eugenics control, the Rockefeller control.
[00:41:43.128 --> 00:41:45.008]  It keeps going back to the same people of our medicine.
[00:41:45.088 --> 00:41:46.909]  And Trump is breaking it all up.
[00:41:47.529 --> 00:41:48.750]  It is amazing.
[00:41:49.977 --> 00:41:55.681]  If you're already going to die, and you want to take some risky treatments, that's how you should develop new stuff, let them do it.
[00:41:56.301 --> 00:42:03.026]  But no, instead the globalists take all the real stuff for themselves, in very expensive Swiss clinics and other areas, and then you don't get access to it.
[00:42:03.086 --> 00:42:04.687]  Well, guess what globalists?
[00:42:04.727 --> 00:42:07.910]  You're not going to hoard the life extensions to yourself.
[00:42:09.311 --> 00:42:10.331]  Watch my film Endgame.
[00:42:11.392 --> 00:42:12.933]  I know the President's seen it, I've been told.
[00:42:14.154 --> 00:42:15.015]  That's already what's going on.
[00:42:15.035 --> 00:42:16.516]  See, it's not like he learned it from Endgame.
[00:42:16.556 --> 00:42:17.777]  He understands what's already happening.
[00:42:18.595 --> 00:42:21.196]  And it's all about them suppressing new medical developments.
[00:42:21.256 --> 00:42:22.396]  It's all happening.
[00:42:22.957 --> 00:42:24.197]  Unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[00:42:24.277 --> 00:42:25.077]  Everything Trump promised.
[00:42:25.097 --> 00:42:26.038]  We're gonna go to break, come back with more.
[00:42:26.358 --> 00:42:35.281]  Please don't forget, this Memorial Day week, we have free shipping on all our best-selling items, and 50% off on super high-quality items like X2 and Selenium.

[00:42:50.229 --> 00:42:51.050]  Amazing product.
[00:42:51.531 --> 00:42:54.175]  Cold pressed, organic, 50% off and much more.
[00:42:54.255 --> 00:42:56.538]  Infowarsstore.com or infowarslife.com.
[00:42:56.778 --> 00:43:00.744]  We'll be back with more positive news straight ahead from our champion.
[00:43:02.955 --> 00:43:09.583]  One of the things I'm really proud of is the fact that doing my own research, talking to top scientists, we knew that there was an iodine conspiracy.
[00:43:10.264 --> 00:43:12.066]  Iodine is in every cell of your body.
[00:43:12.647 --> 00:43:18.534]  Iodine deficiency is the commonest preventable cause of brain damage and loss of IQ in the world.
[00:43:18.935 --> 00:43:21.558]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:21.838 --> 00:43:24.860]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:31.125]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:31.785 --> 00:43:38.250]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:44.514]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50 percent of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:44.974 --> 00:43:48.597]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:49.077 --> 00:43:57.283]  And I am so proud of the fact that since I've been promoting iodine the last five, six years, it is now all the rage at health food stores, you name it.
[00:43:57.683 --> 00:44:03.928]  But none of them are as pure or as clean as the original Survival Shield X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:44:04.964 --> 00:44:09.407]  I was just about to walk out of the studio to pick my children up, and I got some bad news.
[00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:18.172]  For the second time in the five and a half year history of Survival Shield X2, our flagship product, we are having supply chain problems.
[00:44:18.713 --> 00:44:20.394]  And this may be the last batch of this.
[00:44:20.934 --> 00:44:27.858]  You see, we have to go through the DEA to get this because it is pure atomic iodine.
[00:44:27.918 --> 00:44:33.342]  Everything else out there is bound, or it's contaminated, it's not absorbable, it's toxic.
[00:44:34.042 --> 00:44:46.151]  We have deep earth crystal source that's so pure that it actually turns into purple gas in the atmosphere and it's ejected into palm oil, organic palm oil, in a proprietary patented process.
[00:44:46.272 --> 00:44:48.794]  And so in our own search to get the purest form,
[00:44:49.534 --> 00:44:56.996]  We discovered that oil companies and gas drilling companies had a byproduct that they were selling to pharmaceutical companies and also drug makers.
[00:44:57.016 --> 00:44:57.916]  They used to make drugs.
[00:44:58.096 --> 00:44:59.417]  That's why the FDA is involved.
[00:45:00.057 --> 00:45:02.077]  And that's why the DEA is involved.
[00:45:02.477 --> 00:45:07.199]  So it's a major industrial product being used and that we could actually bring to the public pure.
[00:45:07.779 --> 00:45:11.360]  But you've got to get contracts with oil companies and gas companies to do it.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.521]  And once they figure out there's a market, they start jacking up the price.
[00:45:16.101 --> 00:45:18.842]  So, we have a run of this, a limited run.
[00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:20.022]  We have a good supply right now.
[00:45:20.422 --> 00:45:21.783]  We're talking maybe two months of it.
[00:45:22.223 --> 00:45:24.524]  But this may be the clincher.
[00:45:24.564 --> 00:45:27.785]  We may not have X2 in this configuration in the future.
[00:45:28.205 --> 00:45:31.606]  But we're offering it still 25% off until it sells out.
[00:45:32.066 --> 00:45:34.187]  Hopefully, just like the last time this happened a few years ago.
[00:45:34.527 --> 00:45:35.907]  It's not an issue and we do get more.
[00:45:36.247 --> 00:45:43.609]  But right now, we are not able to secure the crystals that produce the purest iodine from our own research and the test in the world.
[00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.770]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.550]  Yeah.
[00:46:00.367 --> 00:46:00.908]  Pure iodine.
[00:46:01.288 --> 00:46:02.009]  Pure iodine.
[00:46:02.109 --> 00:46:04.331]  You will end up having all sorts of disorders.
[00:46:04.631 --> 00:46:05.332]  Just like water.
[00:46:05.432 --> 00:46:06.252]  Just like oxygen.
[00:46:06.553 --> 00:46:08.695]  Without iodine, it is an essential element.
[00:46:09.055 --> 00:46:10.296]  It's available exclusively.
[00:46:10.577 --> 00:46:11.517]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:46:11.537 --> 00:46:13.259]  At Infowarslife.com.
[00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:14.520]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.861]  And I hope, like a few years ago...
[00:46:16.969 --> 00:46:18.150]  That we can work this out.
[00:46:36.281 --> 00:46:39.063]  Or what they said before, a non-zero sum game.
[00:46:39.403 --> 00:46:47.728]  So get your Survival Shield X2 today along with other great products at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the tip of the spear in the fight for free speech and human dignity worldwide.
[00:46:48.288 --> 00:46:52.611]  This could potentially be the end of Survival Shield X2 as we know it.
[00:46:53.051 --> 00:46:59.595]  If you love the original like I do and thousands of others have, it's available now for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:06.861 --> 00:47:11.046]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:20.877 --> 00:47:24.602]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news.
[00:47:25.162 --> 00:47:27.124]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:40.793]  Everything about globalism is suppressing American innovation, American dominance, but also ensuring that the general public of the world doesn't get life extension technologies, doesn't get clean air conditioning, clean cars.
[00:47:41.153 --> 00:47:42.093]  They don't want innovation.
[00:47:42.133 --> 00:47:43.894]  They want a post-industrial world.
[00:47:44.254 --> 00:47:48.034]  That's the official goal of the UN, UNESCO, Agenda 21.
[00:47:48.214 --> 00:47:48.915]  That's a fact.
[00:47:50.135 --> 00:47:52.875]  Remember Obama went to Africa and said you can't have cars or air conditioning.
[00:47:53.735 --> 00:47:56.416]  He went to South America and said you're going to live in communism.
[00:47:56.476 --> 00:47:56.836]  I'm not.
[00:47:58.064 --> 00:48:00.045]  And the people are like, look at him, the graduate students.
[00:48:01.165 --> 00:48:17.152]  So I feel so good backing Trump because you have a lot of terminally ill people in this country with thousands of treatments that are known to extend their lives or even save them, that sometimes they wait 20 years and then never even approve something because they don't want Americans having access to this.
[00:48:18.273 --> 00:48:21.534]  And yeah, people are going to die with some of these treatments, but they're already dying.
[00:48:21.955 --> 00:48:22.695]  They have a right.
[00:48:23.015 --> 00:48:25.016]  If the left says you have a right to kill yourself,
[00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:29.152]  And I think if you make the decision, you do.
[00:48:29.572 --> 00:48:30.753]  But you don't want the state involved.
[00:48:32.295 --> 00:48:35.698]  But the larger issue is, do you have a right to take then whatever treatment you want?
[00:48:35.938 --> 00:48:36.578]  You better believe it.
[00:48:36.619 --> 00:48:37.820]  But they want less treatments.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.781]  And man, I was just watching him live.
[00:48:39.841 --> 00:48:42.224]  I gotta air this into the next hour, because we backed up at the start.
[00:48:42.644 --> 00:48:46.728]  He was saying, Americans have always been fighters, and we never give up!
[00:48:47.776 --> 00:48:50.717]  This is very personal to me, and he went on and talked about that.
[00:48:51.417 --> 00:48:53.077]  So, he's the real deal, folks.
[00:48:53.137 --> 00:48:54.737]  And, you know, I'm being sued by The Globalist.
[00:48:55.217 --> 00:48:55.878]  I'm being attacked.
[00:48:56.118 --> 00:48:58.198]  The left admits they're lying about me.
[00:48:58.558 --> 00:48:59.678]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:49:00.298 --> 00:49:03.959]  But it's worth it for the children that we're going to save through restricting abortion.
[00:49:05.219 --> 00:49:10.560]  And we're already cut it back through what we're doing with the right to fight.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:13.501]  They should have called it the right to fight, not just the right to try.
[00:49:14.625 --> 00:49:16.406]  Sounds like Trump wants to rename it the Right to Fight.
[00:49:16.807 --> 00:49:23.291]  And they have, you know, the New Republic and the New York Times all this week saying, Alex Jones is waking America up.
[00:49:23.532 --> 00:49:25.113]  He must be silenced.
[00:49:25.153 --> 00:49:26.394]  Here's the New Republic.
[00:49:26.454 --> 00:49:28.035]  The legal war on Alex Jones.
[00:49:28.755 --> 00:49:31.918]  And they admit the Democrats are financing it.
[00:49:31.938 --> 00:49:32.338]  Opinion.
[00:49:32.518 --> 00:49:33.339]  This is the New York Times.
[00:49:33.579 --> 00:49:34.860]  The Alex Jones presidency.
[00:49:38.533 --> 00:49:44.822]  They say in Rolling Stone it's not about the First Amendment and they totally misrepresent what I've done and what I've said and say it's time to be platforming and get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:49:45.163 --> 00:49:46.505]  Because nobody reads you anymore!
[00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.527]  Because you're a joke!
[00:49:48.788 --> 00:49:51.271]  The average Rolling Stone article has like zero comments.
[00:49:51.552 --> 00:49:52.673]  Write about me, it has thousands!
[00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:55.490]  So, I'm on the right side of history.
[00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:56.910]  I'm so proud I backed Trump.
[00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.431]  I'm so proud I've been proven right.
[00:49:58.631 --> 00:49:59.251]  He's not perfect.
[00:49:59.271 --> 00:49:59.951]  He's not a dictator.
[00:49:59.991 --> 00:50:00.611]  He can't do it all.
[00:50:00.811 --> 00:50:01.752]  But he's the real deal.
[00:50:02.432 --> 00:50:04.473]  And he is scaring these globals to death.
[00:50:05.053 --> 00:50:13.456]  And so, yeah, I got mad at Trump when he bombed Syria again, because I know the rebels did the chemical attack or staged it, and this time they confirmed they didn't even do it.
[00:50:13.896 --> 00:50:14.456]  It didn't happen.
[00:50:14.696 --> 00:50:16.997]  And Trump withdrew the funding from the White Helmets after.
[00:50:17.577 --> 00:50:19.018]  But he was putting Iraq in a hard place.
[00:50:19.038 --> 00:50:21.759]  If he didn't act, they would have been able to launch a wider war.
[00:50:21.779 --> 00:50:27.301]  So I just more and more just trust Trump in my spirit, in my gut, but also in his action.
[00:50:27.661 --> 00:50:30.542]  They don't want you having access to the technology we developed.
[00:50:31.667 --> 00:50:33.508]  Folks, they got cures to almost everything now.
[00:50:33.848 --> 00:50:35.249]  They can definitely extend your life.
[00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:38.931]  And they don't know how to roll this out without the public learning about it.
[00:50:38.991 --> 00:50:40.572]  So that's what globalism is all about.
[00:50:40.972 --> 00:50:46.154]  We're all fighting about racism while we're all getting hit with chemical and biologicals and binary weapons.
[00:50:46.214 --> 00:50:47.295]  And Trump knows all about it.
[00:50:47.315 --> 00:50:53.318]  That's why he said to the State of the Union, I'm going to get that health care and the cures and treatments they're blocking released.
[00:50:54.198 --> 00:50:55.719]  It's your right if you want to take it or not.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.520]  It's your right to read the insert.
[00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.781]  You're already dying anyways.
[00:51:01.072 --> 00:51:04.896]  And he said, and we're learning the secrets of the universe.
[00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:05.657]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:51:05.697 --> 00:51:06.958]  He goes, we're learning the secrets.
[00:51:06.998 --> 00:51:07.979]  They already got a bunch of them.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.704]  He goes, we're going to deploy those new technology, new economies.
[00:51:13.624 --> 00:51:14.886]  Getting massive chills right now.
[00:51:15.586 --> 00:51:18.009]  Every time God knows I'm on the right track, I just get the chills.
[00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:19.550]  It's like, yes, talk about this.
[00:51:19.891 --> 00:51:24.996]  The innovation, the action we're going to take, what we're doing together, standing together.
[00:51:26.468 --> 00:51:28.591]  It's a bigger plan, like Kanye said.
[00:51:29.532 --> 00:51:32.417]  Doesn't mean there's not racism, or stobs, or weirdos on every front.
[00:51:32.697 --> 00:51:39.507]  But it means we, the people that have love, to stand up for what's right, are coming together, and we see through the globalists, trying to steal the future.
[00:51:39.667 --> 00:51:40.769]  Trying to steal everything we've got.
[00:51:42.227 --> 00:51:45.708]  So I'm going to go back to this powerful Trump speech until we're done with it in the middle of the next hour.
[00:51:46.508 --> 00:51:47.188]  He's still going.
[00:51:47.348 --> 00:51:47.969]  He's on fire.
[00:51:48.349 --> 00:52:01.052]  And then we're going to take your phone calls today, a toll-free number to talk about Roseanne Barr's firing, the Right to Try, the Right to Fight, I'm telling you, Act, China threatening to attack our ships if they come back in.
[00:52:01.093 --> 00:52:02.073]  Our ships are still going in.
[00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:06.255]  That's like the biggest ocean highway in the world they've just grabbed.
[00:52:06.755 --> 00:52:13.318]  The Chinese are attempting a blockade, basically the South China Sea, claiming they control the navigation of it when it's always been an open seaway.
[00:52:14.199 --> 00:52:15.679]  This is just, this is incredible.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.200]  That's all coming up.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.661]  We'll hear from military folks on that front.
[00:52:19.681 --> 00:52:19.841]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:52:19.861 --> 00:52:20.061]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[00:52:20.081 --> 00:52:20.121]  877-789-2539.
[00:52:20.141 --> 00:52:21.082]  I'll go back to Trump in a moment.
[00:52:21.202 --> 00:52:23.103]  Please don't forget, we, let me tell you something.
[00:52:33.174 --> 00:52:38.056]  I got a lot of aces up my sleeve with The Globalist, with all their attacks and things to fund and expand the operation.
[00:52:38.796 --> 00:52:45.859]  We already put so much product in our supplements, where other supplement companies mark stuff up on average seven times.
[00:52:46.219 --> 00:52:47.620]  Ours is about 150% markup.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.181]  When we do discounts, it's like a 50% markup.
[00:52:53.122 --> 00:52:58.704]  Where, you know, you're looking at a $70 bottle, there's $30 of product in that, if it's something like
[00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.672]  DNA Force, PQQ, CoQ10, all of it's very expensive.
[00:53:02.972 --> 00:53:06.254]  Ours is the real organically sourced type, and by that I mean it's from organic sources.
[00:53:07.414 --> 00:53:11.217]  It's lab created, you can't technically call it organic, but it's from an organic source, it's not synthetic.
[00:53:12.938 --> 00:53:18.000]  Take an example of that, or our nootropic that other people sell similar formulas for 60 bucks.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.121]  Ours is normally $39.95, it's $19.95 right now.
[00:53:19.141 --> 00:53:19.962]  You cannot beat these deals.
[00:53:23.183 --> 00:53:30.892]  And my ace in the hole is, I can water the products down and massively increase our capital to expand to face the globalists, but I'm not going to do that.
[00:53:31.412 --> 00:53:32.614]  You want the best.
[00:53:32.974 --> 00:53:34.636]  We have gone out and developed the best.
[00:53:34.856 --> 00:53:39.902]  It's why they're attacking our supplements, trying to demonize them, trying to test them, coming up empty time and time again.
[00:53:41.337 --> 00:53:44.239]  Until, of course, you know they won't come up here because we know what they're going to do next.
[00:53:44.639 --> 00:53:46.380]  When these people don't succeed, you know what they do.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.301]  Scum of the Earth.
[00:53:48.221 --> 00:53:52.864]  So, Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:53:52.904 --> 00:53:55.246]  They want control of the future.
[00:53:55.286 --> 00:53:56.507]  We just want freedom in the future.
[00:53:56.927 --> 00:54:06.013]  So, if you believe in what we're doing and want great products, water filtration, air filtration, t-shirts, books, films, go to Infowarsstore.com today and fund our operation, and we got free shipping.
[00:54:06.053 --> 00:54:07.654]  It's a win-win across the board.
[00:54:08.354 --> 00:54:15.296]  Alright, I'm going to try to shut up now and just get through, in this segment and the next few, Trump's powerful on-fire speech.
[00:54:15.336 --> 00:54:17.777]  Because about 10 minutes ago, he was wound up.
[00:54:17.817 --> 00:54:18.237]  Here it is.
[00:54:18.818 --> 00:54:21.078]  Mike was in there and I said, Mike, how are we doing on that?
[00:54:21.098 --> 00:54:22.079]  We've got to get it approved.
[00:54:22.139 --> 00:54:24.519]  And he was really working it.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:32.262]  And in my State of the Union address four months ago, I called on Congress to pass Right to Try.
[00:54:32.282 --> 00:54:33.162]  It's such a great name.
[00:54:34.023 --> 00:54:35.323]  Some bills, they don't have a good name.
[00:54:36.644 --> 00:54:36.924]  Okay?
[00:54:37.164 --> 00:54:37.624]  They really don't.
[00:54:39.099 --> 00:54:40.200]  But this is such a great name.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:42.761]  From the first day I heard it, it's so perfect.
[00:54:42.881 --> 00:54:44.022]  Right to try.
[00:54:45.022 --> 00:54:47.523]  And a lot of that trying is going to be successful.
[00:54:47.603 --> 00:54:48.404]  I really believe that.
[00:54:48.864 --> 00:54:49.705]  I really believe it.
[00:54:50.665 --> 00:54:53.366]  So, we did it.
[00:54:54.247 --> 00:54:55.608]  And we went through the Senate.
[00:54:55.648 --> 00:54:56.648]  We went through the House.
[00:54:57.949 --> 00:54:58.969]  The House had a bill.
[00:54:59.950 --> 00:55:00.950]  The Senate had a bill.
[00:55:02.151 --> 00:55:04.032]  We go and mish them together.
[00:55:04.072 --> 00:55:05.453]  We got to go back and take votes.
[00:55:06.795 --> 00:55:09.796]  And I said, do me a favor, tell me, which is the better bill for the people?
[00:55:10.156 --> 00:55:13.016]  Not for the insurance company, not for the pharmaceutical companies.
[00:55:13.056 --> 00:55:13.796]  I don't care about them.
[00:55:14.116 --> 00:55:14.756]  I really don't.
[00:55:14.996 --> 00:55:15.797]  I couldn't care less.
[00:55:17.657 --> 00:55:19.057]  They are so pissed right now, folks.
[00:55:22.878 --> 00:55:24.318]  They've been blocking us for so long.
[00:55:25.198 --> 00:55:26.098]  And that's the bill.
[00:55:26.178 --> 00:55:29.019]  I won't tell you which one, but I took the one that was good.
[00:55:29.079 --> 00:55:31.239]  They said one in particular was great for the people.
[00:55:31.599 --> 00:55:32.960]  Not so good for the others.
[00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:33.900]  Great for the people.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:35.240]  We don't care about the others right now.
[00:55:36.235 --> 00:55:41.740]  And it's giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental, life-saving treatments.
[00:55:42.581 --> 00:55:44.482]  And some of these treatments are so promising.
[00:55:46.344 --> 00:55:49.947]  And we're moving that timeline way up anyway, beyond this.
[00:55:50.007 --> 00:55:51.068]  We're moving it way up.
[00:55:51.648 --> 00:55:53.890]  But it's still a process that takes years.
[00:55:54.915 --> 00:55:59.739]  Now it takes up to 15 years, even 20 years, some of these treatments are going.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:06.104]  But for many years, patients, advocates and lawmakers have fought for this fundamental freedom.
[00:56:08.005 --> 00:56:10.227]  And as I said, incredibly, they couldn't get it.
[00:56:11.708 --> 00:56:12.569]  And there were reasons.
[00:56:13.449 --> 00:56:20.515]  A lot of it was business, a lot of it was pharmaceuticals, a lot of it was insurance, a lot of it was liability.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.161]  I said, so you take care of that stuff, and that's what we did.
[00:56:24.241 --> 00:56:33.825]  Today, I'm proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the Right to Try legislation into law.
[00:56:39.628 --> 00:56:42.209]  They want to bully us, and if we support the President, we'll be destroyed.
[00:56:42.329 --> 00:56:42.749]  So be it.
[00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:44.530]  I'm not going to turn my back on the President.
[00:56:48.098 --> 00:56:50.921]  If I looked like that, I would have been president ten years earlier.
[00:56:50.941 --> 00:56:58.067]  If I had that face, if I had that head of hair, I would have been president so long ago.
[00:56:59.429 --> 00:56:59.989]  That's great.
[00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:04.073]  So I want to thank a couple of people.
[00:57:05.134 --> 00:57:06.956]  Secretary Azar is here.
[00:57:07.196 --> 00:57:10.138]  Secretary, Secretary, please stand up.
[00:57:10.158 --> 00:57:11.340]  You have worked so hard on this.
[00:57:12.810 --> 00:57:13.691]  We're going to go to break now.
[00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:15.693]  He really gets wound up here in a few minutes.
[00:57:15.733 --> 00:57:16.854]  He's just thanking people right now.
[00:57:16.874 --> 00:57:19.237]  We're going to start the second hour here.
[00:57:19.918 --> 00:57:21.079]  And you just see the progress.
[00:57:21.139 --> 00:57:22.681]  It's like we had the boat tied up at the dock.
[00:57:23.702 --> 00:57:25.143]  You ever been trying to leave the dock in a boat?
[00:57:25.163 --> 00:57:28.107]  You're like, oh, whoa, we got a rope still on.
[00:57:29.502 --> 00:57:32.783]  Well, he's just hacking the ropes off, and there's only a few ropes left.
[00:57:33.143 --> 00:57:36.964]  And the globalists know that if he gets the economy fully back, it's over for them.
[00:57:37.585 --> 00:57:38.085]  It's over.
[00:57:38.225 --> 00:57:39.885]  They're not going to probably get the House and Senate.
[00:57:40.025 --> 00:57:42.426]  For the first time since the Civil War, that hasn't happened.
[00:57:42.886 --> 00:57:43.847]  To a party out of power.
[00:57:44.007 --> 00:57:44.967]  They are losers.
[00:57:45.027 --> 00:57:45.807]  They are exposed.
[00:57:46.107 --> 00:57:49.428]  They're on the CHICOM payroll, and they're going to prison.
[00:57:49.448 --> 00:57:49.929]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.229 --> 00:57:50.729]  Hour number two.
[00:58:01.525 --> 00:58:13.773]  You know we're doing world-changing things here, and I decided, because we did this last year, I was looking back at the calendar a few weeks ago, and I noticed that last Memorial Day we did some of the biggest specials of the year, so we're doing it right now.
[00:58:14.133 --> 00:58:17.315]  A huge raft of specials, great products, chance for you to try them out.
[00:58:17.335 --> 00:58:23.279]  Memorial Day Patriots Special, the vaunted Brain Force with thousands of five-star reviews.
[00:58:23.539 --> 00:58:29.343]  And the 4.8 rating, unprecedented, is 50% off $19.95.
[00:58:29.484 --> 00:58:32.005]  There are formulas that aren't even as good that retail for $60.
[00:58:33.306 --> 00:58:37.269]  You cannot get, from my research, a better utropa or a price anywhere near this.
[00:58:37.409 --> 00:58:38.750]  Infowarslife.com
[00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:42.213]  X2 and Bio-True Selenium 50% off combo.
[00:58:42.313 --> 00:58:45.515]  X2 is now 50% off when you get it with a bottle of selenium.

[00:58:46.715 --> 00:58:48.597]  So both are 50% off in that combo now.
[00:58:48.737 --> 00:58:49.377]  And free shipping.
[00:58:49.397 --> 00:58:50.738]  Free shipping storewide.

[00:58:52.179 --> 00:58:53.840]  Brain Force Plus 50% off.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.461]  The Real Red Pill Plus now with added energy boost.

[00:59:00.384 --> 00:59:01.445]  High quality coil silver.
[00:59:01.565 --> 00:59:02.125]  Alpha Power
[00:59:02.285 --> 00:59:04.887]  That is an amazing, energized energy.

[00:59:18.556 --> 00:59:23.560]  Info Wars, life, super high quality, storable food, private label, My Patriot Supply to go below.

[00:59:25.081 --> 00:59:28.363]  One year and six month, three month food supplies, 50% off.
[00:59:28.503 --> 00:59:29.444]  No one can top that.
[00:59:29.484 --> 00:59:31.405]  That is the best deal for my research on the internet.
[00:59:31.485 --> 00:59:33.806]  Immune wall 50% off with free shipping.
[00:59:33.886 --> 00:59:35.827]  Pollen block 50% off with free shipping.

[00:59:36.747 --> 00:59:37.767]  Horrify Soros.
[00:59:37.887 --> 00:59:41.769]  Stand in the gap against the forces of eugenics and mass murder.
[00:59:42.169 --> 00:59:43.149]  Planetary death.
[00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.070]  That's it.
[00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.090]  This is planetary death we're fighting.
[00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:49.032]  Find our operation and we will rampage forward.
[00:59:54.594 --> 00:59:58.695]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.215 --> 01:00:00.476]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:11.403 --> 01:00:20.167]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:33.153]  You know, there are a lot of cowards out there who want to hedge their bets and talk trash about Trump, talk trash about me, out the sides of their mouth, play along with the mainstream media so they don't get blocked and censored on the web.
[01:00:33.173 --> 01:00:36.495]  If they're successful shutting us down, they're going to shut all of you down.
[01:00:37.631 --> 01:00:40.812]  I'm not talking to our audience, I'm talking to the establishment and wannabes out there.
[01:00:41.493 --> 01:00:43.553]  The world is changing, we're trailblazing.
[01:00:44.234 --> 01:00:46.695]  And Trump has kept another giant promise.
[01:00:47.715 --> 01:00:52.657]  He's kept already, he's already gotten half of what he said he'd do done in a year and a half, unprecedented.
[01:00:53.878 --> 01:00:57.899]  He's had about an 85% accuracy rate on how he implemented those things.
[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.761]  A dictator couldn't execute that well.
[01:01:02.061 --> 01:01:03.722]  Dictators can't run anything, everything falls apart.
[01:01:05.285 --> 01:01:07.466]  I mean, it's magic what Trump's been able to do.
[01:01:07.546 --> 01:01:08.947]  And yeah, he's done some things I haven't liked.
[01:01:08.967 --> 01:01:10.548]  Went back on his promise on Afghanistan.
[01:01:11.928 --> 01:01:16.570]  Went a little bit sideways on Syria, but overall he's been keeping his promise after that.
[01:01:16.711 --> 01:01:19.752]  Pulled the money out of the white helmets that were caught staging the attacks.
[01:01:21.533 --> 01:01:24.154]  The last ones that almost got us into war, that's four times they've been caught.
[01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:27.216]  The first three they did, the last one they didn't even do the attack.
[01:01:27.556 --> 01:01:28.176]  That's confirmed.
[01:01:29.156 --> 01:01:30.857]  Boy, they sure walked that one back suddenly.
[01:01:30.877 --> 01:01:32.018]  You don't hear about that anymore, do you?
[01:01:33.658 --> 01:01:35.740]  Even the BBC had to admit they staged it.
[01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:38.222]  Pouring water on kids' heads.
[01:01:39.003 --> 01:01:41.786]  Oh, but I'm not supposed to question other big events or I get sued.
[01:01:41.806 --> 01:01:44.208]  And then they misrepresent what I've even said.
[01:01:45.489 --> 01:01:47.371]  Because they don't want you questioning.
[01:01:47.391 --> 01:01:49.713]  They want the precedent that you've got to believe mainstream media.
[01:01:49.733 --> 01:01:50.774]  That's what they're actually saying.
[01:01:51.715 --> 01:01:55.058]  In this article out of the New Republic, they say, well, Jones isn't protected.
[01:01:56.138 --> 01:01:59.340]  By New York Times versus Sullivan, because he's not really news.
[01:01:59.781 --> 01:02:01.762]  Only we in the newspapers are protected.
[01:02:02.443 --> 01:02:04.124]  You are unbelievable.
[01:02:05.004 --> 01:02:09.027]  You are unbelievable, as you spew a bunch of lies about me in your article.
[01:02:10.008 --> 01:02:11.689]  It's just these people are such liars.
[01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:13.711]  They're what they claim we are.
[01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:15.292]  I trailblazed.
[01:02:17.333 --> 01:02:18.034]  I got censored.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:29.986]  Mike Cernovich got the news last December that they were paying millions to have me delisted off Google, outside of their algorithm, having other companies go out and put out lies about us and vote us down.
[01:02:30.666 --> 01:02:36.830]  And they said, because I exposed the chemical attacks that year, that April, with Ron Paul and others.
[01:02:40.372 --> 01:02:43.734]  But, I mean, the rebels admitted they launched a chemical attack to get us in there.
[01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:44.835]  They had the motive, too.
[01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:46.156]  But that, okay, fine.
[01:02:47.025 --> 01:02:48.706]  People are like, oh, you're going to get delisted.
[01:02:48.726 --> 01:02:51.347]  You won't make as much money if you don't plan.
[01:02:51.508 --> 01:03:00.213]  I'm not playing along with Al Qaeda and ISIS launching chemical attacks to go blow up another country protecting Christians so I get more shares on the internet.
[01:03:00.813 --> 01:03:02.274]  Don't give a flippin' flip!
[01:03:03.404 --> 01:03:06.045]  And it's not because I'm a hero, I'm a real pragmatist.
[01:03:07.446 --> 01:03:11.168]  I got into media to defend the Second Amendment and the family and to expose abortion.
[01:03:11.248 --> 01:03:13.569]  I got into it to expose the eugenicists and the globalists.
[01:03:13.669 --> 01:03:17.351]  I got into it to expose the whole global system and to have a better system.
[01:03:17.812 --> 01:03:22.154]  I got into things to change things, not to take over the existing system.
[01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:28.897]  Now we got a beachhead with Trump, and that's why I know he's not perfect, but he's getting a lot done.
[01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:31.759]  And that's why I'm now a cheerleader for that beachhead.
[01:03:33.666 --> 01:03:40.429]  And he is starting to drain the swamp, and they are screaming, they are yelling, they are gnashing, they are flipping out, they are bending over backwards.
[01:03:40.529 --> 01:03:43.150]  They don't know what to do.
[01:03:44.151 --> 01:03:47.472]  We come back and we'll play the rest of the speech, and then go to your calls.
[01:03:47.492 --> 01:03:48.092]  877-789-2539.
[01:03:48.293 --> 01:03:52.695]  But they're trying to break our will.
[01:03:52.815 --> 01:03:55.396]  Soros, admittedly, we broke the sheshte.
[01:03:56.408 --> 01:03:57.468]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:03:57.488 --> 01:04:00.129]  Kit Daniels did a blurb, we did a video, got almost no attention.
[01:04:00.389 --> 01:04:02.350]  Let's retweet that, because it broke in the afternoon.
[01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:06.111]  I want to retweet that out, that... Breaking!
[01:04:06.951 --> 01:04:14.113]  George Soros is the main funder behind... Everybody gets a chip on their shoulder, everybody has a race war Starbucks.
[01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:15.054]  Of course they are!
[01:04:15.354 --> 01:04:16.974]  It's the biggest franchise in the country.
[01:04:18.395 --> 01:04:20.035]  And it's meant to create mental illness.
[01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:22.456]  And even the psychological studies we show in our article...
[01:04:23.934 --> 01:04:25.694]  Say it makes racism worse!
[01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:26.995]  Of course it does!
[01:04:27.355 --> 01:04:31.035]  What kills racism is inviting people over to your house to barbecue.
[01:04:31.895 --> 01:04:38.277]  What invites racism... What invites it is all of this hyping up constantly.
[01:04:40.117 --> 01:04:42.257]  And banning comedy and chips on the shoulders.
[01:04:42.317 --> 01:04:42.877]  It's crazy.
[01:04:43.117 --> 01:04:46.838]  When we come back, we're going to finish up with Trump's powerful speech.
[01:04:47.138 --> 01:04:49.339]  The right to try.
[01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:50.399]  The right to fight back.
[01:04:50.439 --> 01:04:51.859]  The right to fight for your life act.
[01:04:52.779 --> 01:05:02.103]  Because if you're already terminal, and it's your decision, if you've got a right to kill yourself, the left wants, with poison and Jack Kevorkian, why wouldn't you have the right to fight for your life?
[01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:09.345]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[01:05:10.065 --> 01:05:13.387]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[01:05:14.227 --> 01:05:20.469]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:28.614]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[01:05:29.415 --> 01:05:34.678]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[01:05:35.259 --> 01:05:44.005]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:46.286]  Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it.
[01:06:09.425 --> 01:06:10.549]  You know what I want to do?
[01:06:10.790 --> 01:06:12.737]  I want to get it finished.
[01:06:13.399 --> 01:06:15.547]  The prize I want is victory for the world.
[01:06:33.415 --> 01:06:37.879]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:37.899 --> 01:06:39.561]  Move, bitch!
[01:06:39.741 --> 01:06:40.922]  Get out the way!
[01:06:48.252 --> 01:06:53.254]  Infowars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:56.735]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[01:06:56.855 --> 01:06:58.255]  I will not let you down.
[01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:01.056]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:07:01.176 --> 01:07:02.737]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[01:07:02.817 --> 01:07:05.278]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:07:05.398 --> 01:07:11.620]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:13.501]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:07:13.521 --> 01:07:14.701]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:07:18.479 --> 01:07:37.135]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, just four months ago at the State of the Union, Trump promised to fight as hard as he could to get the right to try legislation through that they've tried to get through for decades to allow people who are terminally ill to try experimental treatments before they've been approved.
[01:07:37.255 --> 01:07:39.758]  Some are totally safe, some are very, very dangerous.
[01:07:40.118 --> 01:07:42.040]  Many hundreds have already been approved in other countries.
[01:07:43.103 --> 01:07:43.683]  Big U.S.
[01:07:43.703 --> 01:07:54.629]  drug companies that have the patents on deadly chemotherapy and other bug poison, where they charge you $1,000 per treatment for something that costs them 30 cents, they don't want competition.
[01:07:54.669 --> 01:07:56.750]  They want to cut and burn Americans.
[01:07:57.410 --> 01:07:59.431]  They want to make sure they can kill you slow.
[01:08:00.772 --> 01:08:08.535]  Not the doctors, but the big pharma and the big control arms, like Bayer that knowingly shipped out HIV and hepatitis blood to over a million hemophiliacs.
[01:08:08.976 --> 01:08:11.597]  And Monsanto, who's merging with them, who's even more evil.
[01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:15.357]  Well now, Trump is keeping that promise again.
[01:08:15.597 --> 01:08:16.498]  The right to fight.
[01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:22.603]  Again, the left wants everybody to be able to commit suicide and have state-sponsored systems killing old people.
[01:08:23.083 --> 01:08:24.024]  That's what right to die is.
[01:08:24.064 --> 01:08:25.405]  It's the state's right to kill you.
[01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:32.631]  Well then don't people have a right then to go out and take an experimental treatment if they're already dying?
[01:08:34.161 --> 01:08:44.025]  The governments around the world that are left as controlled are trying to make it where if someone just doesn't want to live because they're depressed, they can kill themselves.
[01:08:46.587 --> 01:08:50.468]  Okay, well then, does someone have a right then if they're dying to fight for their life?
[01:08:50.588 --> 01:08:50.848]  Oh no.
[01:08:51.209 --> 01:08:52.689]  The left all over the U.S.
[01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:58.492]  and all over the world, they fight against this because they want governmental control of healthcare and to decide what you get.
[01:08:58.692 --> 01:09:00.333]  Because they're control freaks.
[01:09:00.753 --> 01:09:02.714]  Donald Trump is a progress freak.
[01:09:03.334 --> 01:09:05.156]  Donald Trump's got a bigger plan.
[01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:09.120]  Donald Trump's part of the bigger plan Kanye's talking about.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.404]  We're all part of that bigger plan, unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[01:09:13.924 --> 01:09:15.506]  Show, he just signed it a few minutes ago.
[01:09:15.786 --> 01:09:18.889]  Here's President Trump, the promise keeper, four months ago.
[01:09:20.391 --> 01:09:26.457]  We also believe that patients with terminal conditions, terminal illness,
[01:09:27.535 --> 01:09:35.461]  Should have access to experimental treatment immediately that could potentially save their lives.
[01:09:36.281 --> 01:09:43.026]  People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure.
[01:09:43.827 --> 01:09:47.910]  I want to give them a chance right here at home
[01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:56.992]  It's time for Congress to give these wonderful, incredible Americans the right to try.
[01:09:57.372 --> 01:09:57.673]  Yes!
[01:09:59.253 --> 01:10:00.073]  And now it's law.
[01:10:01.454 --> 01:10:08.356]  And already the big pharma and the big insurance companies, the ones that gave you Obamacare, to double and triple your prices, thank God you're so dumb, Gruber said.
[01:10:09.296 --> 01:10:12.217]  They're all Obama's guys, said you're dumb, thank God you're so dumb.
[01:10:12.237 --> 01:10:12.797]  I don't think you're dumb.
[01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:13.657]  Trump doesn't think you're dumb.
[01:10:16.988 --> 01:10:18.389]  In fact, I saw Trump in a speech last week.
[01:10:18.430 --> 01:10:18.990]  I met him at the club.
[01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:20.572]  He said, you know, there are a lot of smart Americans.
[01:10:21.213 --> 01:10:23.475]  You know, I think Americans are smarter than some people say they are.
[01:10:23.515 --> 01:10:29.581]  You know, I think if we treat them like they're smart, we put out information and have a real debate, I think we'll turn the country around.
[01:10:29.882 --> 01:10:31.704]  He totally gets the enemy's attitude.
[01:10:32.164 --> 01:10:34.407]  And more and more, I watch Trump and it's magic, man.
[01:10:34.447 --> 01:10:35.207]  He's got it!
[01:10:36.451 --> 01:10:38.914]  And they wonder how he'll say the same thing I say the same day.
[01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:41.076]  Even simultaneously sometimes.
[01:10:41.576 --> 01:10:42.517]  Or how I predicted.
[01:10:42.537 --> 01:10:45.600]  The New York Times came to me on the inauguration day and they said, how did you predict?
[01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.403]  He'd talk about bringing God back into America and the covenant.
[01:10:48.683 --> 01:10:50.445]  He'd talk about unlocking secret technology.
[01:10:51.106 --> 01:10:54.990]  And the New York Times guy, right there as I was leaving the inauguration, he was waiting.
[01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:57.112]  Outside, you know, the VIP area.
[01:10:57.572 --> 01:10:58.053]  And he said,
[01:11:00.526 --> 01:11:01.387]  He said, how did you know that?
[01:11:01.407 --> 01:11:02.408]  You talked to the president today?
[01:11:02.428 --> 01:11:03.208]  Did somebody give you the speech?
[01:11:03.228 --> 01:11:03.849]  And I said, no.
[01:11:04.449 --> 01:11:05.230]  We're synced up.
[01:11:05.730 --> 01:11:07.492]  And that New York Times guy, he wrote a big hit piece.
[01:11:07.512 --> 01:11:09.333]  He just went... He took a deep breath.
[01:11:10.074 --> 01:11:10.874]  He kind of shook.
[01:11:11.595 --> 01:11:13.276]  Because you get it.
[01:11:13.877 --> 01:11:20.402]  Because you're synced up with your people, screwing everybody over, running your scams, telling people how good you are when you're not.
[01:11:20.622 --> 01:11:23.764]  You're a bunch of broken, weak people, and that's why you hate everybody.
[01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:27.748]  Because scum like you wants to see everybody else suffer, you rats.
[01:11:28.715 --> 01:11:31.976]  You seek out your power because you don't have any innate power in your soul.
[01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.057]  Well, we're getting you off our backs.
[01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:39.378]  And you can feel it metaphysically, and so I'm happy to be persecuted by you people.
[01:11:39.398 --> 01:11:44.079]  Because no matter what happens to me in the end, we are going to defeat you, and you know it!
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:47.540]  Alright, let's go back to the speech.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.921]  I promise I'm going on a load of phone lines.
[01:11:49.421 --> 01:11:50.781]  Here it is.
[01:11:50.821 --> 01:11:51.221]  What do you think?
[01:11:53.763 --> 01:11:55.565]  We have great healthcare.
[01:11:56.105 --> 01:11:57.667]  We got rid of the individual mandate.
[01:11:57.687 --> 01:12:00.070]  Without that, we couldn't be doing what we're doing in a few weeks.
[01:12:01.751 --> 01:12:06.176]  We're going to have great, inexpensive, but really good healthcare.
[01:12:06.336 --> 01:12:10.361]  And we have two plans coming out.
[01:12:10.421 --> 01:12:14.125]  We also have, through our great Secretary of Labor,
[01:12:15.276 --> 01:12:19.420]  We have a great plan coming out, and that's through associations.
[01:12:20.481 --> 01:12:22.302]  And so we're going to have two plans coming out.
[01:12:22.923 --> 01:12:23.563]  Oh, hit pause again.
[01:12:23.623 --> 01:12:26.686]  And for the most part... Do you have any idea what this is going to do to health care costs?
[01:12:26.706 --> 01:12:33.772]  They're going to plunge because they're blocking so many other alternative treatments, just calling them experimental, never even letting them get to the process for over a decade of being tested.
[01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:36.975]  The big pharma wrote these laws to do this, okay?
[01:12:37.275 --> 01:12:38.116]  Nobody else puts up with this.
[01:12:41.371 --> 01:12:43.571]  Now, this is going to be a whole new boom in the economy.
[01:12:44.212 --> 01:13:05.556]  Prices will go down, choices will go up, and there'll be all these new treatment centers, and all this new stuff, and all these new choices, and then people rating what worked for them, and then synergistically, the good treatments will get more support, and our medicine will become good again, and not eugenics-based, run by AI computers from IBM, named after the top Nazi.
[01:13:06.296 --> 01:13:09.717]  The top Nazi, Hitler said, above him!
[01:13:11.411 --> 01:13:14.712]  He was given like the quadruple eagle.
[01:13:15.372 --> 01:13:17.372]  Look up the award Thomas Watson got from Hitler.
[01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:20.873]  I know it's the highest award ever given in the Third Reich.
[01:13:21.753 --> 01:13:23.414]  And that's who's going to run our healthcare?
[01:13:23.874 --> 01:13:24.334]  No!
[01:13:24.674 --> 01:13:25.694]  You will not!
[01:13:29.195 --> 01:13:31.095]  But again, they've got captive audiences, don't they?
[01:13:31.816 --> 01:13:33.096]  They've got captive audiences.
[01:13:35.407 --> 01:13:42.712]  Like our VA, and poor people, and the National Health Service in England, now run by Thomas the Demon Computer.
[01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:46.635]  Thomas Watson, you cannot make this stuff up!
[01:13:47.276 --> 01:13:55.822]  But, oh, there's Nazis everywhere, oh, the average white person's Nazis, oh, somebody says a lady looks like an ape, it's because they're racist, no, she looks like a fish!
[01:13:59.025 --> 01:14:01.967]  Here, let's go back, let's go back to Trump, here it is.
[01:14:03.368 --> 01:14:05.389]  Gotten tremendous.
[01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:12.251]  Could have had it done a little bit easier, but somebody decided not to vote for us.
[01:14:12.271 --> 01:14:13.231]  That's one of those things.
[01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:18.233]  I want to thank Secretary Azar, and I want to thank Commissioner Gottlieb.
[01:14:18.273 --> 01:14:18.773]  Where's Scott?
[01:14:19.274 --> 01:14:20.034]  Scott, stand up.
[01:14:20.454 --> 01:14:22.155]  I like those socks.
[01:14:22.235 --> 01:14:23.315]  I like those socks, Scott.
[01:14:27.279 --> 01:14:31.101]  And Scott, let me ask you, so it takes years and years to get this approved, right?
[01:14:32.061 --> 01:14:36.003]  You're bringing down, beyond this, you're bringing down that period of time.
[01:14:36.383 --> 01:14:42.706]  What is the average time now it takes for, you know, a major, a major medicine or cure?
[01:14:42.746 --> 01:14:46.188]  What's the average time it takes to go through the system and get an approval?
[01:14:49.289 --> 01:14:49.930]  Three to seven.
[01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:52.191]  And some go long over ten, right?
[01:14:53.226 --> 01:14:54.227]  And you're bringing that down?
[01:14:54.247 --> 01:14:55.408]  You're trying to bring that down?
[01:14:55.548 --> 01:14:56.368]  You know, for safety.
[01:14:56.849 --> 01:14:57.329]  Very good.
[01:14:57.889 --> 01:15:00.371]  And you in particular, you're very happy with this, aren't you?
[01:15:01.072 --> 01:15:06.816]  You have a lot of good things in the wings that, frankly, if you moved them up, a lot of people would have a great shot, right?
[01:15:11.498 --> 01:15:12.598]  Right, that's fantastic.
[01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:13.418]  Well, thank you, Scott.
[01:15:13.478 --> 01:15:14.959]  We're very proud of the job you're doing.
[01:15:15.139 --> 01:15:17.520]  By the way, you know why Trump is obsessed with this, too.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.220]  He knows what other rich people have access to.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:20.300]  He knows what he has access to.
[01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:26.662]  And he knows what they've got in Thailand, what they've got in Switzerland, what they've got in other areas.
[01:15:26.762 --> 01:15:28.003]  It is just unbelievable.
[01:15:28.443 --> 01:15:32.244]  And he also knows that he's the president.
[01:15:33.044 --> 01:15:41.709]  And so over at the Naval Center and at the other places where he gets health care, and those special wings, oh boy do they have some stuff.
[01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:44.311]  He knows all about it.
[01:15:45.051 --> 01:15:46.212]  So that's what's going on.
[01:15:46.532 --> 01:15:49.314]  This is breaking free folks, technology for the people.
[01:15:49.734 --> 01:15:51.795]  I'm going to finish up because he gets on fire in a minute.
[01:15:51.815 --> 01:15:53.976]  And we're going to come back, go to all your phone calls.
[01:15:54.097 --> 01:15:57.759]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:58.099 --> 01:15:59.480]  Please spread those links.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.281]  They censor those less than InfoWars.com.
[01:16:02.515 --> 01:16:02.695]  What?
[01:16:03.496 --> 01:16:07.458]  It was early on in the Revolutionary War, when the U.S.
[01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:14.983]  Navy had less than ten major surface ships, that John Paul Jones, the father of the U.S.
[01:16:15.043 --> 01:16:20.867]  Navy, while engaging a British ship three times the size of his, said, I've only begun to fight.
[01:16:24.289 --> 01:16:27.251]  And that's when the ship was sinking and was on fire.
[01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:29.032]  But he didn't give up.
[01:16:30.316 --> 01:16:30.776]  And he won.
[01:16:32.518 --> 01:16:33.919]  That's part of the ethos of this country.
[01:16:34.679 --> 01:16:38.783]  But not everybody is brought right to the wall and given victory.
[01:16:40.023 --> 01:16:43.246]  The Alamo stood and fought victory or death Colonel Travis.
[01:16:44.367 --> 01:16:45.247]  And they all died.
[01:16:45.508 --> 01:16:46.849]  All 180 plus men.
[01:16:47.329 --> 01:16:52.233]  But the seed of that example led to the victory that came.
[01:16:53.834 --> 01:16:58.077]  So I don't know how Infowars fight is gonna end.
[01:16:58.258 --> 01:16:59.899]  But I know this.
[01:17:02.419 --> 01:17:06.962]  Faced with the same challenges that John Paul Jones and Colonel Travis faced.
[01:17:07.582 --> 01:17:14.907]  With this country under attack by foreign evil forces, hell-bent on enslaving us and destroying the promise of the Renaissance.
[01:17:15.888 --> 01:17:22.692]  I will quote Colonel Travis 110% and hope that I can man up to be in his shoes and say victory or death.
[01:17:24.198 --> 01:17:27.902]  Let me tell you something, I get tears in my eyes when I think about that because I love America.
[01:17:28.823 --> 01:17:36.370]  It's not fear that makes me get tears in my eyes, it's will and strength boiling to defeat these tyrants and these globalists.
[01:17:38.773 --> 01:17:48.262]  But that said, just like our information is game changing, the products that we sell, all of them,
[01:17:50.646 --> 01:17:53.990]  And whether it's colloidal silver from 1995, the very best out there.
[01:17:55.011 --> 01:17:57.133]  Same stuff they sell at Whole Foods for $5 less.
[01:17:57.533 --> 01:17:59.736]  Or whether it's DNA Force that's now back in stock.
[01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:01.277]  PQQ.
[01:18:01.297 --> 01:18:01.498]  Go Q10.
[01:18:03.817 --> 01:18:11.440]  And the other key elements that are in this product would cost $300, $400 if you put it all separately in little bottles.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.581]  They sell PQQ in little bottles.
[01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:23.886]  With a third the dose we put in this, each caplet, each powder capsule, and it is, again, the third as much, and it's like $40, $50 for a little bottle.
[01:18:25.575 --> 01:18:25.995]  Think about that.
[01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:27.996]  It's $74 right now.
[01:18:28.936 --> 01:18:33.898]  It's our flagship, most expensive product because these compounds are expensive to get and to have organic.
[01:18:34.899 --> 01:18:36.199]  And that's how we fund our operations.
[01:18:36.259 --> 01:18:44.603]  So I can't read you the thousands of reviews of the old DNA Force or Cell Force that were similar formulas, but this is even stronger and lower price.
[01:18:44.923 --> 01:18:46.644]  So I signed a bigger contract, not a better deal.
[01:18:47.664 --> 01:18:54.667]  We've invested out for the year and believe you're gonna want lower price on this and get the best product So I'm not gambled.
[01:18:55.247 --> 01:18:56.127]  I know you want value.
[01:18:56.167 --> 01:19:13.153]  So we bought even more of it We're signed up every month to get thousands of bottles of it and we've got it right now At the lowest price of this formula and this combination you're gonna find anywhere DNA force go read the five-star reviews thousands of go see what people set it in for them.
[01:19:13.593 --> 01:19:14.554]  It is dramatic
[01:19:15.757 --> 01:19:23.541]  It would take hours to get into all the studies and the facts and the information about what Mother Nature, through God, we were given.
[01:19:24.261 --> 01:19:32.765]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, and then all the other concentrated organic herbs and things that go into this so your body can actually upload it.
[01:19:33.305 --> 01:19:39.848]  DNA Force Plus Telomere Support, now available at MFullRestore.com or you can call 888-253-3139.
[01:19:42.759 --> 01:19:48.364]  Every other major conservative website or talk show host is funded by the Mercers or some other billionaire family.
[01:19:48.564 --> 01:19:49.024]  That's fine.
[01:19:50.465 --> 01:19:51.526]  I'm not funded by any of that.
[01:19:51.946 --> 01:19:52.647]  I'm funded by you.
[01:19:52.867 --> 01:19:53.748]  So thank you all.
[01:19:54.408 --> 01:19:59.412]  And please continue to support us because without you, we will fall to Soros and Hillary.
[01:19:59.953 --> 01:20:02.655]  But I know in my gut we're going to win this one way or the other.
[01:20:07.399 --> 01:20:10.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.683 --> 01:20:20.667]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:22.008 --> 01:20:26.632]  By the way, we were going to have a Tommy Robinson update today, but his guys got threatened.
[01:20:26.652 --> 01:20:27.753]  They're talking to lawyers today.
[01:20:27.773 --> 01:20:29.174]  They think they'll be back on tomorrow.
[01:20:29.214 --> 01:20:30.315]  So that's what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:20:30.335 --> 01:20:33.218]  Well, Tommy has now been in prison since last Friday.
[01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:42.379]  And the judge bragged, because we had the eyewitness from the court, Tommy's manager, on that this isn't about you and the covering the last grooming thing.
[01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:44.941]  You covered this trial, the trial that judge is over.
[01:20:45.342 --> 01:20:47.144]  I'm putting you in jail for 13 months.
[01:20:49.006 --> 01:20:49.786]  Unbelievable.
[01:20:49.826 --> 01:20:51.168]  But I'm going to your calls next segment.
[01:20:52.659 --> 01:21:08.512]  I was just thinking during the breakout, the FDA, under Democrat and globalist control, has been trying to shut down people even getting regular supplements, how the EU's been trying to lower the amount of vitamin C and stuff you need, how they took the iodine out of the salt and they put the bad halogen in the water, fluoride.
[01:21:09.873 --> 01:21:11.315]  I mean, it's just diabolical.
[01:21:11.335 --> 01:21:15.278]  And then you read the documents, how they're trying to make us dumb and stupid and weak.
[01:21:16.319 --> 01:21:21.163]  And so just like they're blocking good medicines and good drugs from us, and good treatments that have been around for decades,
[01:21:23.888 --> 01:21:27.229]  And then keeping prices up, they're going after the supplements as well.
[01:21:27.509 --> 01:21:28.749]  Don't keep them from that.
[01:21:28.829 --> 01:21:30.590]  Get the best supplements out there from our research.
[01:21:30.910 --> 01:21:31.670]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:31.690 --> 01:21:33.130]  Some of the biggest sales ever.
[01:21:33.150 --> 01:21:36.491]  50% off on most of the items and free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:21:36.671 --> 01:21:39.131]  But those, the sale isn't going to last past this week.
[01:21:39.151 --> 01:21:40.072]  We've got to stop it soon.
[01:21:40.092 --> 01:21:42.412]  Some of this stuff's getting ready to sell out like Brain Force Plus.
[01:21:42.432 --> 01:21:45.333]  We may have to end that sale in a couple days because we're selling so much of it right now.
[01:21:46.093 --> 01:21:47.354]  People love it, they know what a good deal it is.
[01:21:47.734 --> 01:21:52.378]  Alright, let's go back to the president getting into signing the right to try.
[01:21:52.398 --> 01:21:55.980]  Hey, the left says you're allowed to kill yourself even if you're not sick.
[01:21:56.361 --> 01:22:00.764]  Why are they so against the right to try new medicines?
[01:22:00.984 --> 01:22:01.304]  Man!
[01:22:02.265 --> 01:22:03.646]  Just like the National Health Service.
[01:22:04.147 --> 01:22:10.512]  I watch Prime Minister's questions on C-SPAN and they always ask questions about people waiting a year, two, three years for cancer surgery.
[01:22:10.832 --> 01:22:12.114]  That's 100% operable.
[01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:13.915]  But when you don't get it, you die.
[01:22:14.736 --> 01:22:15.577]  Death sentences.
[01:22:16.517 --> 01:22:17.358]  Death sentences.
[01:22:18.039 --> 01:22:19.700]  Telling little girls, we're not going to fix your leg.
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:20.421]  Use a cane.
[01:22:21.181 --> 01:22:22.042]  Or we'll cut your leg off.
[01:22:22.522 --> 01:22:23.864]  That's who the left is.
[01:22:23.884 --> 01:22:24.704]  They're not the left.
[01:22:24.985 --> 01:22:25.805]  They're evil.
[01:22:26.206 --> 01:22:27.287]  All the studies show it.
[01:22:27.347 --> 01:22:28.648]  They're bad people.
[01:22:30.384 --> 01:22:34.212]  They're all rich pigs, like Bernie Sanders, preying on idiots.
[01:22:34.974 --> 01:22:35.735]  Let's go back to Trump.
[01:22:35.755 --> 01:22:36.176]  Here it is.
[01:22:38.441 --> 01:22:39.363]  Drugs, right?
[01:22:45.552 --> 01:22:47.854]  And Mr. Secretary, that's already happening, right?
[01:22:47.974 --> 01:22:48.855]  It's already happening.
[01:22:48.915 --> 01:22:53.598]  You were telling me yesterday that we're seeing a big, a tremendous improvement.
[01:22:54.579 --> 01:22:55.820]  And you're going to have some big news.
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:23:06.327]  I think we're going to have some big, some of the big drug companies in, in two weeks, and they're going to announce, because of what we did, they're going to announce voluntary massive drops in prices.
[01:23:07.108 --> 01:23:07.749]  So that's great.
[01:23:07.909 --> 01:23:09.490]  That's going to be a fantastic thing.
[01:23:09.510 --> 01:23:12.792]  You know, we're working on some really great things, aren't we, when you think about it?
[01:23:13.633 --> 01:23:14.674]  We're on pretty good, huh?
[01:23:16.269 --> 01:23:21.193]  We could do some of those healthcare, drug prices, but this is the baby.
[01:23:22.274 --> 01:23:22.754]  Right now.
[01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:30.500]  We would not be here today without the tireless efforts of dedicated members of Congress.
[01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:31.260]  That's so true.
[01:23:31.641 --> 01:23:34.723]  I want to especially thank Senator Ron Johnson.
[01:23:34.763 --> 01:23:35.564]  Stand up please, Ron.
[01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:47.425]  For his tremendous leadership.
[01:23:47.445 --> 01:23:49.826]  You know, I just tell you, he doesn't stop.
[01:23:50.546 --> 01:23:52.027]  He doesn't give up, you know.
[01:23:52.528 --> 01:23:52.888]  It's good.
[01:23:53.168 --> 01:23:54.008]  It's good for all of us.
[01:23:54.248 --> 01:23:58.891]  This guy, Ron, very capable, very... He just doesn't give up.
[01:23:59.752 --> 01:24:02.853]  So, when we started working, I knew this was going to happen.
[01:24:03.894 --> 01:24:06.235]  I also want to thank Senator Donnelly.
[01:24:06.375 --> 01:24:07.956]  Senator Donnelly, thank you very much.
[01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:08.496]  That's really great.
[01:24:08.616 --> 01:24:09.477]  Appreciate it.
[01:24:09.997 --> 01:24:10.377]  Thank you.
[01:24:10.858 --> 01:24:11.158]  Thank you.
[01:24:14.545 --> 01:24:18.989]  A fantastic young gentleman, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.
[01:24:19.709 --> 01:24:24.433]  Brian, congratulations, and I know how hard you work, Brian.
[01:24:26.315 --> 01:24:27.676]  And Dr. Michael Burgess.
[01:24:28.277 --> 01:24:30.399]  Do you like being called doctor or congressman?
[01:24:30.439 --> 01:24:31.099]  I think doctor.
[01:24:31.119 --> 01:24:32.881]  I like doctor.
[01:24:34.382 --> 01:24:35.363]  We'll call him doctor.
[01:24:38.215 --> 01:24:39.275]  Thank you, Michael, very much.
[01:24:39.315 --> 01:24:39.835]  Great job.
[01:24:39.855 --> 01:24:42.876]  You worked, I know how hard everybody worked, and I really appreciate it.
[01:24:42.956 --> 01:24:43.876]  Everybody appreciates it.
[01:24:43.896 --> 01:24:47.157]  The country appreciates it, because nobody understood why this wasn't happening.
[01:24:47.777 --> 01:24:50.458]  You know, they've been talking about this for how long, Ron?
[01:24:50.738 --> 01:24:51.038]  25 years?
[01:24:52.298 --> 01:24:52.898]  Long time.
[01:24:52.918 --> 01:24:53.519]  A lot of talk.
[01:24:54.419 --> 01:24:55.799]  Politicians, it's a lot of talk.
[01:24:56.679 --> 01:25:02.641]  I also want to thank Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, who's not here, but he really worked hard with us.
[01:25:03.241 --> 01:25:03.781]  He really did.
[01:25:08.519 --> 01:25:14.643]  And thanks as well to state and local officials here today who fought for this important cause.
[01:25:15.064 --> 01:25:16.885]  They fought so hard, so many of them.
[01:25:17.865 --> 01:25:25.831]  I want to thank you for the incredible work that you've done on behalf of these and all wonderful Americans.
[01:25:25.851 --> 01:25:28.553]  I mean, anybody can be there someday.
[01:25:28.813 --> 01:25:29.734]  Anybody can be there.
[01:25:29.954 --> 01:25:33.616]  Could you all stand up, the state, local people that worked so hard on this?
[01:25:33.656 --> 01:25:34.937]  Because you really have been.
[01:25:34.977 --> 01:25:35.357]  Thank you.
[01:25:35.377 --> 01:25:35.537]  Yep.
[01:25:36.718 --> 01:25:37.399]  Thank you, fellas.
[01:25:39.909 --> 01:25:43.031]  Couldn't have done it without the state and local, and I appreciate it.
[01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:44.352]  Really great job.
[01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:44.752]  Thank you.
[01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:51.017]  Most of all, we're honored to be joined by several brave Americans for whom this bill is named.
[01:25:52.398 --> 01:25:59.403]  Matthew Bellina, who is battling ALS, and his incredible wife, Caitlin.
[01:25:59.903 --> 01:26:00.263]  Matthew.
[01:26:11.914 --> 01:26:18.197]  Laura McLynn and her son Jordan, who is battling muscular dystrophy.
[01:26:18.537 --> 01:26:19.718]  Some good answers.
[01:26:23.379 --> 01:26:24.680]  That sounds great.
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:27.341]  See, according to Bill Gates, people should all die.
[01:26:27.361 --> 01:26:28.562]  Thanks for being with us, Jordan.
[01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:31.199]  I'm going to have some good answers for you.
[01:26:32.119 --> 01:26:33.279]  You're going to be happy.
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:34.080]  You are happy.
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:44.284]  Frank Mangiello, who is battling ALS, and who is joined by his wife, Marilyn, and their six children.
[01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.985]  Wow, that's fantastic.
[01:26:46.545 --> 01:26:47.065]  That's fantastic.
[01:26:47.105 --> 01:26:47.826]  Thank you.
[01:26:54.308 --> 01:26:55.069]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:26:55.089 --> 01:26:55.609]  You have children.
[01:26:58.109 --> 01:27:13.116]  And finally, I want to thank for being here and introduce Tim Wendler, who tragically lost his wife, Trickett, to ALS and joined also by their three children.
[01:27:13.976 --> 01:27:15.457]  So Tim, thank you very much.
[01:27:15.497 --> 01:27:22.820]  Thank you, Tim.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:23.841]  I want to thank you all
[01:27:25.288 --> 01:27:29.832]  For being here, you have extraordinary courage, determination, and love.
[01:27:30.033 --> 01:27:30.513]  You have love.
[01:27:31.154 --> 01:27:31.614]  Real love.
[01:27:32.895 --> 01:27:37.480]  And thanks to you, the countless American lives will ultimately be saved.
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:43.325]  We will be saving... I don't even want to say thousands, because I think it's going to be much more.
[01:27:43.445 --> 01:27:44.807]  Thousands and thousands.
[01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:45.968]  Hundreds of thousands.
[01:27:45.988 --> 01:27:47.669]  We're going to be saving tremendous numbers of lives.
[01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:48.110]  Millions.
[01:27:49.469 --> 01:27:54.551]  And it's so great that you're up here with us and that we're all on this front line together.
[01:27:55.231 --> 01:28:03.113]  Each year thousands of terminally ill patients suffer while waiting for new and experimental drugs to receive final FDA approval.
[01:28:04.214 --> 01:28:05.254]  Takes a long time.
[01:28:06.836 --> 01:28:07.797]  Time's coming down.
[01:28:08.397 --> 01:28:17.181]  While we were streamlining and doing a lot of streamlining, the current FDA approval process can take, as Scott just said, many years.
[01:28:17.782 --> 01:28:18.622]  Many, many years.
[01:28:18.982 --> 01:28:23.064]  And for countless patients, time, it's not what they have.
[01:28:23.484 --> 01:28:24.505]  They don't have an abundance.
[01:28:24.565 --> 01:28:26.066]  I promise I'm going to your calls.
[01:28:26.186 --> 01:28:27.067]  This is really important.
[01:28:27.668 --> 01:28:28.569]  Americans are fighters.
[01:28:28.609 --> 01:28:29.890]  We never give up here in just a moment.
[01:28:30.170 --> 01:28:36.175]  And I promise we're going to John, Wesley, Kevin, Chris, John, Michael, Nelson, John in Ontario, and many others.
[01:28:36.235 --> 01:28:36.816]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:28:36.856 --> 01:28:37.637]  A lot of great points.
[01:28:38.618 --> 01:28:41.941]  On Roseanne Barr, on the censorship, on China threatening to attack.
[01:28:43.229 --> 01:28:43.469]  U.S.
[01:28:43.489 --> 01:28:44.971]  ships, on all of it.
[01:28:45.031 --> 01:28:47.714]  But Trump is really breaking the obstructionist will.
[01:28:48.515 --> 01:28:49.896]  They call themselves the progressives.
[01:28:50.377 --> 01:28:51.858]  No, they are the regressives.
[01:28:52.359 --> 01:28:55.302]  And this is a big, big deal, how they've been suppressing American medicine.
[01:28:55.762 --> 01:29:00.107]  Because they want to stifle all of our innovation, but they want control of healthcare, and they want to kill you!
[01:29:02.239 --> 01:29:03.619]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:05.180]  You can't survive without it.
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.280]  But where do you get it?
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:12.342]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[01:29:12.562 --> 01:29:18.284]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[01:29:18.484 --> 01:29:35.352]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new gravity block core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[01:29:35.732 --> 01:29:37.873]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[01:29:38.214 --> 01:29:39.414]  Stainless steel construction.
[01:29:39.694 --> 01:29:40.415]  Easy assembly.
[01:29:40.735 --> 01:29:41.356]  Low maintenance.
[01:29:41.636 --> 01:29:43.457]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[01:30:07.213 --> 01:30:15.682]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[01:30:15.742 --> 01:30:15.982]  Yes.
[01:30:16.883 --> 01:30:20.307]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[01:30:20.427 --> 01:30:20.887]  That's right.
[01:30:21.869 --> 01:30:22.029]  Yes.
[01:30:22.769 --> 01:30:31.692]  I mean, that sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[01:30:32.632 --> 01:30:33.412]  Was it difficult?
[01:30:35.793 --> 01:30:37.114]  Not at all.
[01:30:37.354 --> 01:30:38.674]  Soros is very powerful.
[01:30:39.194 --> 01:30:47.777]  Ezra Levant called him out for this Nazi thing many years ago, and Ezra has been in lawfare with, I'm convinced, with Soros-funded people.
[01:30:48.437 --> 01:30:48.978]  Ever since.
[01:30:49.158 --> 01:30:53.741]  But the irony of all this is, you know where that 60 Minutes reporter got his information from?
[01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:55.963]  George Soros.
[01:30:56.643 --> 01:31:00.906]  If you want to know about his Nazi involvement, check out his books.
[01:31:01.367 --> 01:31:03.248]  He's the one who let the cat out of the bag.
[01:31:03.408 --> 01:31:07.211]  I'm sure it's something he deeply regrets now, but he let the cat out of the bag.
[01:31:07.671 --> 01:31:14.140]  I've been told, that's why I've been sued 12 times by Democrats, is that Hillary's butt hurt and that leave George Soros alone.
[01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:19.948]  No, I'm going to start having giant conferences about the Nazi collaborator George Soros, and I'm calling for his arrest.
[01:31:20.008 --> 01:31:21.510]  So, keep suing, brother.
[01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:22.551]  I'm never giving in.
[01:31:22.571 --> 01:31:23.092]  I love it.
[01:31:23.152 --> 01:31:23.512]  Let's go.
[01:31:24.453 --> 01:31:28.834]  You know, if you get an argument for a 14-year-old trying to survive, okay, I can get with that.
[01:31:29.134 --> 01:31:34.135]  But how about the, whatever that was, the 65-year-old, 75-year-old talking about how he doesn't regret it?
[01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:38.437]  I was just saying to my buddy today, I beat up David McIntosh in fourth grade.
[01:31:38.717 --> 01:31:40.577]  I threw him in the creek that goes behind our school.
[01:31:40.937 --> 01:31:41.957]  I feel bad about that.
[01:31:42.418 --> 01:31:44.058]  But David McIntosh lived.
[01:31:44.938 --> 01:31:50.361]  And he received zero Zyklon B in my grade school.
[01:31:50.842 --> 01:31:55.124]  George Sos was responsible for I don't know how many... Thousands.
[01:31:55.164 --> 01:31:58.646]  He was a collaborator and then said, I feel good about it.
[01:31:59.326 --> 01:32:00.287]  I'd do it over again.
[01:32:00.507 --> 01:32:01.527]  Someone else would have done it.
[01:32:01.708 --> 01:32:03.408]  It's a very sociopathic statement.
[01:32:04.489 --> 01:32:09.712]  If an enemy took over my country and said, help us round up fellow Americans or we'll kill you, I wouldn't do it.
[01:32:09.992 --> 01:32:11.192]  You know what's really going on here?
[01:32:11.312 --> 01:32:13.193]  Once again, it's their identity politics.
[01:32:13.253 --> 01:32:18.714]  And you say something bad about a group, like globalists, and they go, well, a lot of globalists are Jews, so you hate Jews.
[01:32:18.754 --> 01:32:20.314]  And you go, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:20.894 --> 01:32:22.314]  I am an idea man.
[01:32:22.374 --> 01:32:23.894]  We are ideas people.
[01:32:24.174 --> 01:32:26.535]  And our idea is nationalism.
[01:32:26.855 --> 01:32:28.495]  Someone else's idea is globalism.
[01:32:28.815 --> 01:32:32.376]  I don't care what group, what kind of people are on either side.
[01:32:32.436 --> 01:32:33.296]  I don't deal in that.
[01:32:33.336 --> 01:32:34.736]  I don't deal in identity politics.
[01:32:35.096 --> 01:32:35.897]  I deal with ideas.
[01:32:35.957 --> 01:32:38.517]  And my idea is the West is the best.
[01:32:38.957 --> 01:32:41.718]  America is the greatest nation, and I want to protect this nation.
[01:32:41.998 --> 01:32:43.259]  I don't want open borders.
[01:32:43.519 --> 01:32:48.361]  I don't care what color, what religion, what specifics other people have.
[01:32:48.761 --> 01:32:50.502]  All I care about is those ideas.
[01:32:50.882 --> 01:32:52.203]  Western show me.
[01:32:52.263 --> 01:32:56.365]  If you're pro-America, pro-Western, pro-success, pro-freedom, you can be purple.
[01:32:56.385 --> 01:32:56.865]  We love you.
[01:33:06.363 --> 01:33:10.967]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:26.899 --> 01:33:31.583]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.972 --> 01:33:40.212]  The promise of America is truly coming back.
[01:33:41.613 --> 01:33:50.334]  The idea that we built upon that made it the greatest nation on earth that people from across the planet, around the globe, aspired to come to and be part of.
[01:33:51.455 --> 01:34:03.697]  And now President Trump, four months after promising to get the Right to Try Act, through Congress, has signed it, so that Big Pharma, who's been lobbying against it, cannot continue to block
[01:34:05.543 --> 01:34:08.284]  Promising treatments to people that are terminally ill.
[01:34:08.324 --> 01:34:11.444]  This will accelerate many incredible treatments for everybody else.
[01:34:11.844 --> 01:34:13.225]  This is true innovation.
[01:34:13.665 --> 01:34:16.986]  The left, of course, has said, let everybody have the right to commit suicide.
[01:34:17.026 --> 01:34:20.266]  Let the state decide if they can get rid of you if you're not needed.
[01:34:20.706 --> 01:34:25.667]  Like the Netherlands on national TV has a Down syndrome man on and explains how he needs to commit suicide.
[01:34:26.088 --> 01:34:27.848]  This is the sickness of these people.
[01:34:28.677 --> 01:34:35.669]  But oh, the liberals, oh, the Mother Joneses and the CNNs, oh, people might get hurt in these treatments.
[01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:37.932]  It's their free will, isn't it?
[01:34:38.673 --> 01:34:39.976]  That's what it's all about, isn't it?
[01:34:41.892 --> 01:34:49.696]  So Trump, here's the powerful video, says America has always been about fighters before he signs the historic legislation.
[01:34:49.716 --> 01:34:52.657]  This just happened minutes ago, and we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:34:53.437 --> 01:34:54.738]  Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:54.778 --> 01:34:58.260]  America has always been a nation of fighters who never give up.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:34:58.660]  Here it is.
[01:35:03.058 --> 01:35:12.063]  Now with the passage of this bill, Americans will be able to seek cures right here at home, close to their family and their loved ones.
[01:35:13.104 --> 01:35:19.447]  We are finally giving these wonderful Americans the right to try.
[01:35:19.567 --> 01:35:20.248]  So important.
[01:35:30.313 --> 01:35:33.934]  America has always been a nation of fighters who never give up.
[01:35:35.034 --> 01:35:35.254]  Right?
[01:35:35.635 --> 01:35:36.355]  We never give up.
[01:35:36.555 --> 01:35:36.815]  Ever.
[01:35:37.015 --> 01:35:37.295]  Right?
[01:35:39.036 --> 01:35:39.716]  Never give up.
[01:35:39.936 --> 01:35:43.557]  We're fighters like the amazing patients and families here today.
[01:35:43.817 --> 01:35:57.221]  Now, as I proudly sign, and this is very personal for me, but as I proudly sign this bill, thousands of terminally ill Americans will finally have the help, the hope,
[01:35:58.502 --> 01:36:05.466]  And the fighting chance, and I think it's going to be better than chance, that they will be cured.
[01:36:06.586 --> 01:36:07.767]  That they will be helped.
[01:36:09.508 --> 01:36:17.753]  That they'll be able to be with their families for a long time, or maybe just for a longer time.
[01:36:17.793 --> 01:36:18.173]  That's right.
[01:36:19.261 --> 01:36:28.090]  But we're able to give them the absolute best as to what we have at this current moment, at this current second.
[01:36:29.872 --> 01:36:33.396]  And now we're going to help a lot of people.
[01:36:33.837 --> 01:36:35.438]  And that will raise quality.
[01:36:36.219 --> 01:36:38.061]  So it's an honor to be signing.
[01:36:39.562 --> 01:36:48.944]  This, and if I might, I think I'll present, I think I have to do this, Ron, I have to present this good-looking guy with the first pen.
[01:36:49.004 --> 01:36:49.644]  Is that okay?
[01:36:49.684 --> 01:36:50.444]  You don't mind, right?
[01:36:50.544 --> 01:36:51.784]  Okay, good, I'm gonna do that.
[01:36:54.485 --> 01:37:00.346]  All Trump does all day is classy stuff.
[01:37:06.607 --> 01:37:07.887]  Boy, the left takes this.
[01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:11.577]  They're just all vicious, greedy, hateful people.
[01:37:12.699 --> 01:37:16.805]  Remember all the clips we could play of Bill Gates kidnapping and telling teachers unions?
[01:37:17.827 --> 01:37:20.811]  If we don't give an old lady treatment, that's ten teachers we can hire.
[01:37:20.831 --> 01:37:22.033]  They're all rubbing their hands together.
[01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:27.332]  When you build up higher quality economies, then everybody does better.
[01:37:27.352 --> 01:37:28.373]  That's called civilization.
[01:37:28.673 --> 01:37:30.414]  When you demand higher standards.
[01:37:31.374 --> 01:37:33.735]  But in the new globalist system, we're supposed to live under austerity.
[01:37:33.775 --> 01:37:34.836]  This is so critical.
[01:37:35.136 --> 01:37:36.637]  This is so historic what's happened.
[01:37:36.697 --> 01:37:38.658]  Okay, we're going to your phone calls.
[01:37:38.798 --> 01:37:41.580]  You have another amazing guest joining us, but I'm gonna get to all your calls here.
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:44.861]  Ali Alexander getting into Roseanne and the war on free speech.
[01:37:45.602 --> 01:37:47.763]  That amazing individual, he's coming up.
[01:37:49.667 --> 01:37:50.787]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:37:50.847 --> 01:37:51.568]  Thank you for holding.
[01:37:51.628 --> 01:37:54.808]  Chris in Virginia, you're welcome to join us.
[01:37:54.828 --> 01:37:55.148]  Thank you.
[01:37:57.349 --> 01:38:02.971]  I just wanted to talk about why it was important for Trump to wait the year two.
[01:38:03.451 --> 01:38:07.752]  And year one, he wasn't going to be able to get anything done because he didn't have the power of the government.
[01:38:08.392 --> 01:38:18.655]  Now, I say he's still at about 40 percent, but it gives him the opportunity to actually put pressure on Big Pharma, because that's where a lot of the swamp is.
[01:38:18.735 --> 01:38:19.175]  Your thoughts?
[01:38:20.832 --> 01:38:24.894]  I think, didn't you call in about a year ago and you said, just give Trump a chance, watch what he does year two?
[01:38:26.014 --> 01:38:26.634]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:38:26.995 --> 01:38:27.715]  Yeah, that was me.
[01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:30.296]  Well I think what you said is what we should listen to because you were right.
[01:38:30.576 --> 01:38:32.437]  He's, I mean, it's just what you said.
[01:38:32.457 --> 01:38:39.460]  As he gets more power under the Constitution, as he finally gets through, you see exponentially it gets better.
[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:40.260]  It gives me chills.
[01:38:42.096 --> 01:38:47.138]  Yeah, I definitely think that we're on the right path and we're on the right track.
[01:38:47.378 --> 01:38:51.899]  If people are impatient, you know, they are very impatient with Trump.
[01:38:52.259 --> 01:38:54.540]  You know, draining a swamp takes time.
[01:38:54.560 --> 01:39:00.241]  It's a lot, 50 some years or more, and I'm just saying that as throwing it out there, 50 plus years of corruption.
[01:39:00.582 --> 01:39:03.502]  You try going up against a whole system that's corrupt like that.
[01:39:04.103 --> 01:39:08.444]  It'll probably be depression and draining, so you have to admire Trump.
[01:39:08.564 --> 01:39:10.505]  I was about to say, just what they've done to me.
[01:39:10.805 --> 01:39:12.486]  The media tried to come take my kids.
[01:39:13.246 --> 01:39:15.647]  They've got George Soros, Hillary, all of them suing me.
[01:39:16.748 --> 01:39:20.910]  And I'm not complaining, but let me tell you, I couldn't imagine being Trump and what they do to him and his family.
[01:39:20.950 --> 01:39:21.370]  Exactly.
[01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:22.230]  I mean, this is a war.
[01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:22.871]  This is real.
[01:39:23.251 --> 01:39:28.413]  Let me tell you, I've never felt 1-100 the heat I've gotten supporting Trump from the sides of evil.
[01:39:28.433 --> 01:39:29.834]  That lets you know that he's for real.
[01:39:31.710 --> 01:39:42.094]  And the second thing I just wanted to say, I just wanted to let you know that I think that a lot of people cannot understand why Alex Jones gets the intel that he does.
[01:39:42.414 --> 01:39:48.157]  I think it even makes some of the people that you have on with you a little bit jealous of you, even though they're smart people.
[01:39:48.697 --> 01:40:00.662]  But you have to stay dedicated to Trump, because I think you're the key in bringing a lot of outside people that normally wouldn't dig Trump or get down with Trump, bring them across to even just pay attention a little bit to what he's doing.
[01:40:02.233 --> 01:40:03.855]  Well, the enemy has figured that out.
[01:40:03.935 --> 01:40:08.761]  I didn't think I was that important, but they are legitimately saying, bring down Jones, we'll have Trump.
[01:40:09.042 --> 01:40:19.915]  And I think it's only because, like you said, we put out the counter-talking points, they're true, that countervail their lies, and then other people pick up in talk radio and the internet what we're saying.
[01:40:20.456 --> 01:40:22.197]  And so they kind of see us as the epicenter.
[01:40:22.237 --> 01:40:24.619]  Not just me, but the whole InfoWars operation.
[01:40:24.659 --> 01:40:27.040]  So that's why I'm telling listeners what you're saying is absolutely true.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.762]  Your hopes, your prayers, your support is critical.
[01:40:30.422 --> 01:40:32.123]  Because let me tell you, they are coming after us.
[01:40:32.283 --> 01:40:34.425]  And whatever happens, I'm okay with it.
[01:40:35.638 --> 01:40:37.639]  I tell you, I really don't want them to win.
[01:40:38.679 --> 01:40:40.040]  Because I know we're going to win in the end.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:43.181]  It's just that I may not do too well at the end of the equation.
[01:40:43.241 --> 01:40:44.462]  And that's what I asked for.
[01:40:44.482 --> 01:40:47.403]  You know, I prayed for God to put me in a position to take these people on.
[01:40:48.343 --> 01:40:51.564]  But I thought it'd be in some small, junior, Bush League way.
[01:40:51.584 --> 01:40:53.885]  I didn't ever envision it would be at this level.
[01:40:55.446 --> 01:40:56.266]  Think of it this way.
[01:40:56.286 --> 01:41:00.848]  You're doing a great service to your grandkids down the road.
[01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.629]  Absolutely.
[01:41:03.649 --> 01:41:04.130]  God bless you.
[01:41:04.150 --> 01:41:04.850]  Appreciate you, man.
[01:41:06.414 --> 01:41:07.915]  Yeah, I told people, I'm not whining.
[01:41:07.975 --> 01:41:10.777]  It's just, let me tell you, I used to, I knew the Globals were evil.
[01:41:11.038 --> 01:41:12.579]  But let me tell you, I really know now.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.883]  And when I say they're out to get you, I mean, they're just bad people, folks.
[01:41:18.923 --> 01:41:20.204]  They're really evil people.
[01:41:20.625 --> 01:41:21.125]  Thank you, Chris.
[01:41:21.145 --> 01:41:21.706]  God bless you.
[01:41:22.086 --> 01:41:23.727]  Who's been home the next longest here?
[01:41:25.148 --> 01:41:28.290]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Louisiana.
[01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:29.571]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:41:29.611 --> 01:41:30.132]  You're on the air.
[01:41:30.152 --> 01:41:30.672]  Thanks for holding.
[01:41:32.454 --> 01:41:35.396]  Thank you, Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:42.943]  I want to send you a bit of appreciation for your generosity and if you'd accept it.
[01:41:43.643 --> 01:41:47.305]  I've made a design for a t-shirt.
[01:41:47.385 --> 01:41:51.387]  It's a we are all Tommy Robinson now t-design.
[01:41:51.407 --> 01:41:55.469]  It's very simple, black and white, but very, very elegant.
[01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:57.001]  It's funny you say that.
[01:41:57.021 --> 01:41:59.764]  I thought about that this weekend because that's pretty much a common sense deal.
[01:41:59.784 --> 01:42:01.806]  We should have shirts that were all Trump now.
[01:42:02.246 --> 01:42:03.608]  We're all Tommy Robinson now.
[01:42:03.908 --> 01:42:05.069]  We're all Alex Jones now.
[01:42:05.129 --> 01:42:10.775]  Because if people really want to put themselves out there to meet good people but also be persecuted to see what it's like.
[01:42:11.576 --> 01:42:14.239]  I think those are three great shirts that we should immediately have produced.
[01:42:15.757 --> 01:42:17.439]  Well, the designs are on the way.
[01:42:17.559 --> 01:42:20.622]  I'm in the process of sending them to Owen.
[01:42:20.682 --> 01:42:23.885]  He seems to be very good at answering, looking at his email.
[01:42:24.286 --> 01:42:25.287]  Kevin figured this out.
[01:42:25.307 --> 01:42:27.089]  You're speaking to Uncle Sam right now.
[01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:29.271]  I figured I'd recognize your voice.
[01:42:29.291 --> 01:42:34.717]  You're the guy that has the big TV bicycle unit that goes around and has all the viral videos.
[01:42:36.262 --> 01:42:48.404]  I want to hear about that because you're down in New Orleans going around with your bike reaching thousands of people a day.
[01:42:48.424 --> 01:42:49.405]  We'll finish up with Michael.
[01:42:49.985 --> 01:42:50.885]  That's Uncle Sam.
[01:42:50.905 --> 01:42:52.565]  We'll give you his YouTube when we come back.
[01:42:53.185 --> 01:42:54.726]  He probably hasn't been on the show in a year either.
[01:42:54.746 --> 01:42:55.986]  I just recognize these guys' voices.
[01:42:56.006 --> 01:42:56.506]  They're awesome.
[01:42:57.126 --> 01:42:58.446]  I recognize the last guy's voice too.
[01:42:58.486 --> 01:42:59.507]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:59.567 --> 01:43:00.047]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.067 --> 01:43:01.227]  Finish up with Uncle Sam and others.
[01:43:02.702 --> 01:43:03.282]  Alphapower.
[01:43:03.662 --> 01:43:04.482]  Here's what you want to know.
[01:43:04.682 --> 01:43:10.644]  You want to go to mfulworthstore.com and read the hundreds and hundreds of five-star third-party reviews on this product.
[01:43:11.324 --> 01:43:14.865]  And also remember that when it came out four months ago, it sold out in three weeks.
[01:43:15.745 --> 01:43:23.687]  Because people that know about these type of products looked at the ingredients list and looked at the potency list and people went crazy.
[01:43:24.227 --> 01:43:27.608]  The average male or female enhancement
[01:43:28.588 --> 01:43:31.550]  Over-the-counter supplement has some real stuff in it.
[01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:33.552]  It just has a little bit in it.
[01:43:33.912 --> 01:43:38.995]  Because I work with the top four formulators in the country, and they say, listen, no one puts as much as you do into these.
[01:43:39.295 --> 01:43:47.621]  They said your leading competitors might put $6, $7 in, and you're putting $15, $20, $30, $40, depending on the product, in them.
[01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:49.062]  Nobody else does that.
[01:43:49.142 --> 01:43:51.904]  Well, we do, and that's why they're so powerful.
[01:43:52.204 --> 01:43:54.225]  Again, Alpha Power sold out for months.
[01:43:54.606 --> 01:43:58.228]  The second shipment is now in at Infowarslife.com or Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:58.268 --> 01:44:00.014]  Go to 4store.com or by calling toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:44:07.185 --> 01:44:10.286]  Let's go ahead and go to Lloyd in Washington.
[01:44:10.326 --> 01:44:10.846]  You're on the air.
[01:44:10.866 --> 01:44:12.007]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:12.047 --> 01:44:12.887]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:44:13.087 --> 01:44:13.707]  Hey, brother.
[01:44:14.007 --> 01:44:14.367]  Good, man.
[01:44:14.388 --> 01:44:15.188]  Thank you for calling.
[01:44:15.268 --> 01:44:15.808]  Hey, hey.
[01:44:15.928 --> 01:44:20.350]  I just wanted to say thanks for your products and everything that you're doing to try to save the country.
[01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:26.932]  I mean, I've tried your Secret 12, Super Male, Anthroplex, the Silver Bullet, Biome Defense, Micro ZX.
[01:44:27.052 --> 01:44:28.772]  I mean, that's all good stuff.
[01:44:28.872 --> 01:44:34.955]  Secret 12, if everybody would just drop their energy drinks and get some Secret 12, take a shot of that.
[01:44:36.175 --> 01:44:37.296]  That's the thing about Secret 12.
[01:44:37.356 --> 01:44:39.778]  Just a half a dropper has way more energy.
[01:44:39.838 --> 01:44:41.360]  People ask, why is it sweet?
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:43.322]  Real organic B12 is sweet.
[01:44:43.802 --> 01:44:44.563]  And exactly.
[01:44:44.583 --> 01:44:48.807]  When I'm super tired, I go, hey, why am I drinking coffee at 10 at night if I'm going on some show like Coast to Coast?
[01:44:49.167 --> 01:44:49.427]  Boom!
[01:44:49.567 --> 01:44:52.410]  Secret 12, 30 minutes later, massive energy.
[01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.990]  It's amazing.
[01:44:53.050 --> 01:44:54.352]  Yeah, that stuff will wake you up.
[01:44:54.412 --> 01:44:57.294]  And the clarity of mind that comes along with that is just amazing.
[01:45:04.358 --> 01:45:08.799]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:45:09.039 --> 01:45:13.700]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:20.181]  And they said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[01:45:20.701 --> 01:45:33.183]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:45:33.943 --> 01:45:35.524]  Unlike other systems.
[01:45:35.564 --> 01:45:41.067]  I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues.
[01:45:41.087 --> 01:45:42.628]  He writes the Texas Law Family Code.
[01:45:42.648 --> 01:45:44.549]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:45:44.869 --> 01:45:45.989]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:45:46.010 --> 01:45:47.290]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:45:47.490 --> 01:45:48.671]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:45:48.891 --> 01:45:50.372]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:45:50.872 --> 01:45:52.473]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:45:52.493 --> 01:45:54.293]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:45:54.633 --> 01:45:57.235]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:45:57.275 --> 01:45:58.135]  This is insane.
[01:45:58.555 --> 01:46:00.176]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:46:00.436 --> 01:46:02.977]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:46:03.437 --> 01:46:04.958]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:46:04.998 --> 01:46:06.819]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:46:06.839 --> 01:46:08.699]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:15.482]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:46:15.742 --> 01:46:17.083]  All just moderate dose.
[01:46:18.592 --> 01:46:26.596]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us a Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:46:26.616 --> 01:46:29.018]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:29.038 --> 01:46:30.178]  But thank you for committing.
[01:46:34.253 --> 01:46:37.075]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:46:37.456 --> 01:46:40.058]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:46:40.078 --> 01:46:44.841]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:46:45.321 --> 01:46:51.446]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:46:51.466 --> 01:46:54.588]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:46:54.929 --> 01:46:56.230]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:47:06.341 --> 01:47:08.975]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:20.435 --> 01:47:28.961]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[01:47:30.121 --> 01:47:32.323]  Broadcasting live from the U.N.
[01:47:32.363 --> 01:47:38.067]  stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:38.407 --> 01:47:43.010]  We're going right back to your phone calls, but Matt Drudge has made another really, really good point.
[01:47:43.956 --> 01:47:51.722]  I remember seeing this this morning, and even split-second thinking, man, I ought to read the side effects of Ambien.
[01:47:52.103 --> 01:47:53.164]  But sure enough, Drudge did it.
[01:47:53.564 --> 01:47:56.346]  The company mocked Roseanne, saying, how dare you, Shay?
[01:47:56.847 --> 01:47:59.729]  In the middle of the night, you were kind of out of it, so your filter was gone.
[01:48:00.530 --> 01:48:02.351]  And so now she says, oh, you can't forgive me?
[01:48:02.451 --> 01:48:03.252]  Oh, I'm so horrible?
[01:48:03.952 --> 01:48:08.116]  What, because you called a lady that looked like a fish, said she looked like a monkey?
[01:48:09.381 --> 01:48:12.563]  I mean, this is just, everybody called Trump monkeys and apes and everything else.
[01:48:13.304 --> 01:48:14.104]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:15.185 --> 01:48:17.826]  It's absolutely ridiculous, but she's all groveling to him.
[01:48:18.687 --> 01:48:29.734]  But Drudge, it's an article on Infowars.com, Drudge highlights ambient side effects after company mocks Roseanne's sleep aid claims not responsible for sitcom star's racism.
[01:48:31.172 --> 01:48:39.198]  I remember a few years ago, an Asian man with no criminal record, for no reason, was walking around in a trench shooting at people and shot a cop in Walmart in Austin.
[01:48:39.759 --> 01:48:43.302]  And I remember saying on air, I bet he was on something like Ambien.
[01:48:44.723 --> 01:48:53.530]  Because I've known people that I've worked with, let's just say that, that are really nice, who woke up in the middle of the night on Ambien and were just walking down the street naked.
[01:48:55.551 --> 01:48:59.854]  I mean, you just totally can black out on it, and that's what the insert says.
[01:49:01.317 --> 01:49:02.598]  So she blames it on that.
[01:49:02.678 --> 01:49:06.960]  She blames it on multiple personalities, whatever, psychotropic drugs, and they make a joke.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:07.860]  So what does drugs do?
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.561]  We've got a link to it on Infowars.com.
[01:49:09.601 --> 01:49:11.402]  He tweeted it, but we have a list of them.
[01:49:11.722 --> 01:49:25.708]  Vomiting, diarrhea, impaired vision, slow breathing, memory loss, disorientation, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, confusion, dizziness, aggression, addiction, withdrawal, which can be life-threatening.
[01:49:26.529 --> 01:49:28.850]  It just goes on and on and on.
[01:49:32.324 --> 01:49:39.589]  Oh, but the company that makes it says people of all races, religions, and nationalities work on it every day and improve the lives of people around the world.
[01:49:40.329 --> 01:49:42.411]  So they just go, Roseanne, ha ha ha, you're crazy.
[01:49:44.092 --> 01:49:51.977]  So yeah, the very big pharma that doesn't want all these other better treatments coming out, that doesn't want you to have choices, they're the ones that want to tell you that Ambien's really great or wonderful.
[01:49:52.878 --> 01:49:53.859]  I've never taken Ambien.
[01:49:53.899 --> 01:49:54.599]  I don't like pills.
[01:49:55.139 --> 01:50:00.263]  I barely even take, you know, Advil, if I've got a sprained ankle or whatever, but I can tell you right now.
[01:50:01.334 --> 01:50:12.871]  That I've talked to people who are well-meaning people in society, how they say, oh yeah, I blacked out on Ambien, or I first got my Ambien prescription and drank one beer and didn't know who I was for six hours.
[01:50:13.372 --> 01:50:15.876]  It's hard core stuff.
[01:50:19.184 --> 01:50:20.305]  Oh yeah, you were right on.
[01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:37.470]  This is all a beard, of course.
[01:50:37.531 --> 01:50:38.771]  The whole racism thing.
[01:50:38.791 --> 01:50:47.538]  Because yesterday, speaking of Matt Grudge, the headline up that I saw was her talking about the 5G.
[01:50:47.578 --> 01:50:48.959]  That was the main headline.
[01:50:49.439 --> 01:50:52.381]  Because that fits in with the eugenics program.
[01:50:52.862 --> 01:50:53.222]  That's right.
[01:50:53.242 --> 01:50:55.264]  You can't have her talking about Soros.
[01:50:55.664 --> 01:50:59.507]  You can't have her talking about saying he's a Nazi collaborator when he admittedly was in his own words.
[01:50:59.887 --> 01:51:01.488]  You can't have any of that.
[01:51:01.508 --> 01:51:03.750]  You can't have her talking about 5G when she's the number one TV star.
[01:51:04.932 --> 01:51:05.352]  That's it.
[01:51:05.432 --> 01:51:05.813]  That's why.
[01:51:05.853 --> 01:51:06.593]  So it's a beard.
[01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:08.295]  It's just shiny keys.
[01:51:08.315 --> 01:51:09.696]  Here are the shiny keys, folks.
[01:51:09.736 --> 01:51:10.356]  Look over here.
[01:51:10.737 --> 01:51:17.522]  Get y'all fighting talking about the definition of comedy and racism and what is, you know, what is humor.
[01:51:18.323 --> 01:51:23.667]  And why do you think George Soros is the main funder in their own press release of the Starbucks?
[01:51:24.188 --> 01:51:26.690]  You're going there to get coffee, not to hear about how you're racist.
[01:51:28.491 --> 01:51:29.032]  Exactly.
[01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.031]  No, we know what this is.
[01:51:32.051 --> 01:51:33.671]  The people on the street know what it is.
[01:51:33.751 --> 01:51:34.691]  I'm talking every day.
[01:51:34.711 --> 01:51:36.012]  I wish I would have had that.
[01:51:36.452 --> 01:51:37.672]  Oh, last week I spoke.
[01:51:38.012 --> 01:51:40.193]  This video is a congresswoman's daughter.
[01:51:40.653 --> 01:51:43.274]  She's a congresswoman from Colorado.
[01:51:43.354 --> 01:51:48.796]  Her husband is the chief, the head chief of Fort Bragg Medical Facility.
[01:51:49.614 --> 01:51:55.019]  Now, of course, I go home the next day and you're talking about Watson and the veterans.
[01:51:55.099 --> 01:51:57.400]  If I'd known that the day before, it's still a good video.
[01:51:57.841 --> 01:51:59.302]  I still have to put up a video.
[01:51:59.362 --> 01:52:10.471]  I talked two days ago to an interrogator, a senior interrogator for terrorists in Afghanistan at the largest facility they have over there.
[01:52:10.932 --> 01:52:17.277]  And he told me about how many more terrorists that are in there now since Trump has got in and what's going on there.
[01:52:18.015 --> 01:52:21.697]  So the reaction of the people on the street, no, they know.
[01:52:21.717 --> 01:52:27.220]  I mean, twice, people from talking to from around the world, especially.
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:29.881]  And there's hours of it every day on your YouTube channel.
[01:52:29.901 --> 01:52:33.122]  A lot of times you live stream, you give people your YouTube channel's address, Uncle Sam.
[01:52:34.383 --> 01:52:40.326]  Yeah, it's my name, Michael D. Barry, D-I capital B-A-R-I.
[01:52:41.078 --> 01:52:47.463]  But the easiest way to get there now is the latest video I put up, is Americans Talk Tommy Robinson.
[01:52:47.483 --> 01:52:56.271]  Oh yeah, just real briefly, you're great among these other callers, what's their view on Tommy Robinson being disappeared for reporting on giant pedophile trials?
[01:52:57.432 --> 01:53:09.022]  Well, oddly enough, two Scottish people I ran into were very negative on Tommy, but the other people of course were appalled by the
[01:53:10.057 --> 01:53:12.059]  The censorship that was going on.
[01:53:12.139 --> 01:53:12.840]  Yeah, you know it's funny.
[01:53:12.860 --> 01:53:16.524]  The Scots fought the hardest against tyranny historically in Europe.
[01:53:17.085 --> 01:53:18.607]  And now I've seen the statistics.
[01:53:18.647 --> 01:53:22.191]  They are the biggest socialists, the biggest anti-free speech people on average.
[01:53:22.211 --> 01:53:23.272]  A lot of great Scots.
[01:53:23.752 --> 01:53:25.755]  It's very shameful what's been done to the Scots.
[01:53:28.234 --> 01:53:32.417]  I was shocked by the reaction of these two different Scottish guys I spoke to.
[01:53:32.497 --> 01:53:35.459]  I mean, they sounded like the biggest social justice warriors.
[01:53:35.479 --> 01:53:41.522]  So they thought it was a great idea to throw people in jail that report on giant Muslim kidnapping rings?
[01:53:42.563 --> 01:53:43.584]  Oh, I hammered them.
[01:53:43.664 --> 01:53:46.466]  I said, how do you even justify what you're talking about?
[01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:50.808]  I mean, because you know, I have a lot of kinship with Tommy Robinson.
[01:53:51.169 --> 01:53:52.249]  I'm on the street too.
[01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:54.891]  I'm right there on the front lines.
[01:53:55.938 --> 01:53:58.279]  But, you know, Tommy's got bigger balls than I do.
[01:53:58.319 --> 01:54:01.621]  He's, you know, he goes into the bad neighborhood.
[01:54:01.721 --> 01:54:03.602]  I'm out there in the middle of a tourist area.
[01:54:04.062 --> 01:54:05.383]  So, you know, it's a bit different.
[01:54:05.763 --> 01:54:08.444]  Well, you're a big guy too, but it doesn't mean you haven't had leftists threaten you.
[01:54:09.104 --> 01:54:11.385]  So, we might have to actually play that later when we have time.
[01:54:11.405 --> 01:54:13.046]  Put that video back on screen for me.
[01:54:13.066 --> 01:54:13.486]  Thanks, guys.
[01:54:14.367 --> 01:54:16.308]  It's Tommy Robinson versus the Scottish.
[01:54:16.368 --> 01:54:16.708]  Is that it?
[01:54:18.949 --> 01:54:23.031]  Well, the one, yeah, Tommy Robinson versus the Scottish, that's one.
[01:54:23.737 --> 01:54:25.489]  The other one below that is, um...
[01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:29.450]  We're all Tommy Robinson now.
[01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:32.351]  That was the first one I posted a couple of days ago.
[01:54:32.871 --> 01:54:34.551]  Listen, we're synced up.
[01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:36.532]  In fact, I meant to put a t-shirt out like that.
[01:54:36.952 --> 01:54:38.832]  Then I was intending to give some of the proceeds to Tommy.
[01:54:39.192 --> 01:54:39.852]  So I'll say it now.
[01:54:39.892 --> 01:54:40.913]  We're going to print that shirt.
[01:54:40.933 --> 01:54:41.533]  It'll only take a week.
[01:54:41.553 --> 01:54:42.673]  We'll get the ad up today.
[01:54:42.713 --> 01:54:44.994]  We never do stuff back order, but it'll say back order.
[01:54:45.014 --> 01:54:46.594]  So expect it in two weeks or so.
[01:54:46.614 --> 01:54:47.394]  We'll get them printed now.
[01:54:47.774 --> 01:54:49.454]  We're all Tommy Robinson now.
[01:54:49.474 --> 01:54:53.135]  And I've got to do it for me, too, because they're all attacking me now.
[01:54:53.775 --> 01:54:56.196]  We're all Alex Jones now, and we're all Donald Trump now.
[01:54:57.236 --> 01:55:01.679]  That's like I am Spartacus when they came to the rebel leader who just overthrown most of the Romans.
[01:55:01.699 --> 01:55:02.559]  They finally defeated him.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:03.960]  They said, we want Spartacus.
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:04.881]  We want to torture him to death.
[01:55:04.921 --> 01:55:08.143]  He was already crucified under another name on the road to Rome.
[01:55:08.603 --> 01:55:10.044]  And they also were saying, I'm Spartacus.
[01:55:10.124 --> 01:55:10.705]  I'm Spartacus.
[01:55:10.745 --> 01:55:11.725]  So that's the attitude.
[01:55:11.745 --> 01:55:12.686]  You're not going to intimidate us.
[01:55:12.926 --> 01:55:13.727]  You're not going to bully us.
[01:55:14.147 --> 01:55:16.728]  But yeah, send us your design and we might print that one up too.
[01:55:16.748 --> 01:55:17.569]  But that's a great idea.
[01:55:17.849 --> 01:55:18.750]  I'm getting on it right now.
[01:55:18.810 --> 01:55:19.390]  You're a genius.
[01:55:19.410 --> 01:55:20.391]  God bless you, Uncle Sam.
[01:55:20.851 --> 01:55:22.252]  He's got such a great YouTube channel.
[01:55:22.672 --> 01:55:23.512]  Every time I come across it.
[01:55:23.572 --> 01:55:23.853]  Okay.
[01:55:24.173 --> 01:55:26.094]  Instead of going to all your calls here, I'm trying to be a good boy.
[01:55:26.774 --> 01:55:30.196]  Let's go to, he's been holding the longest here, Kevin and then John.
[01:55:30.216 --> 01:55:32.357]  Let's go to Kevin in Florida.
[01:55:32.377 --> 01:55:33.317]  You're on the air, then John.
[01:55:35.578 --> 01:55:36.539]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:55:36.559 --> 01:55:38.419]  I just want to make two quick points.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:47.104]  The first being the total hypocrisy of the brain-dead, ignorant left with this ridiculous Roseanne Barr tweet.
[01:55:47.924 --> 01:55:49.905]  Where was the left at when Joy Beyer
[01:55:50.649 --> 01:55:56.614]  She openly praised that Trump Tower was on fire and that she hoped the president was in there burning with the other people.
[01:55:57.275 --> 01:55:58.236]  Where were they on that?
[01:55:58.676 --> 01:56:01.819]  People need to wake up to these tactics.
[01:56:01.839 --> 01:56:03.941]  They've done cartoons as me as a gorilla?
[01:56:03.961 --> 01:56:04.662]  I think it's funny.
[01:56:04.982 --> 01:56:06.704]  They've done Trump as an orangutan.
[01:56:07.124 --> 01:56:10.127]  They did Bush over and over again as a chimpanzee because he kind of looked like one.
[01:56:11.888 --> 01:56:15.792]  Well, that's all fine and good because that was from the liberal perspective so, you know,
[01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:18.752]  Do not do unto us.
[01:56:25.547 --> 01:56:34.675]  Sooner or later, we're going to wake up one day, and we're going to be in a worse trance, and we're going to be like Britain, where if you criticize anybody, they're going to throw you in jail.
[01:56:34.815 --> 01:56:35.816]  This is a process.
[01:56:36.256 --> 01:56:37.477]  They've already got it in most of Europe.
[01:56:37.497 --> 01:56:38.177]  They've got it in England.
[01:56:38.498 --> 01:56:44.783]  They said they want to set the precedent of lying about me in the news, shutting down my speech, to shut everybody else's down.
[01:56:44.823 --> 01:56:46.364]  Since you mentioned this, it's a great point, Kevin.
[01:56:46.384 --> 01:56:46.724]  Stay there.
[01:56:46.744 --> 01:56:51.628]  Again, here's Bill Maher calling Trump the product of an orangutan.
[01:56:51.668 --> 01:56:51.989]  Here it is.
[01:56:53.309 --> 01:57:01.732]  And finally, new rule, now that he's suing me for five million dollars because he says he's proved that he is not the love child of an orangutan.
[01:57:05.834 --> 01:57:07.894]  Donald Trump must learn two things.
[01:57:08.075 --> 01:57:10.495]  What a joke is, and what a contract is.
[01:57:11.156 --> 01:57:13.316]  I agree, and the left should figure that out too.
[01:57:13.377 --> 01:57:14.157]  Last point, Kevin.
[01:57:15.737 --> 01:57:16.818]  And then the other point was,
[01:57:17.785 --> 01:57:20.768]  Just have you seen this new active shooter game?
[01:57:20.808 --> 01:57:23.611]  I believe the Daily Mail has it where... I did see it.
[01:57:23.651 --> 01:57:26.393]  It's a perfect trainer for mental patients to go and shoot schools up.
[01:57:28.135 --> 01:57:34.982]  It's just incredible because some of the comments on here are saying that some of the hallways resemble Columbine, Parkland, and uh...
[01:57:35.857 --> 01:57:38.698]  And, uh, the place in Santa Fe, Texas.
[01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:41.340]  It's totally incredible what's going on here, man.
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:44.081]  It really is a living Twilight Zone.
[01:57:44.501 --> 01:57:44.921]  Absolutely.
[01:57:44.941 --> 01:57:48.543]  100% of the mass shooters is obsessed with shooting up video games.
[01:57:48.583 --> 01:57:48.923]  Fact.
[01:57:49.283 --> 01:57:50.164]  Not saying Bantam.
[01:57:50.964 --> 01:57:51.204]  Fact.
[01:57:56.952 --> 01:57:58.753]  We have the best halogen out there.
[01:57:59.013 --> 01:58:00.915]  X2 is from a deep earth crystal source.
[01:58:00.995 --> 01:58:04.497]  All the other iodine is bound, meaning you don't absorb very much of it.
[01:58:05.177 --> 01:58:06.819]  People have great results with this.
[01:58:07.139 --> 01:58:08.099]  It's the good halogen.
[01:58:08.219 --> 01:58:09.680]  Research the bad halogens.
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:11.201]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[01:58:11.261 --> 01:58:13.983]  Read the 6,000 plus reviews.
[01:58:14.283 --> 01:58:14.844]  4.8 stars.
[01:58:15.444 --> 01:58:17.265]  98% rating by Power Reviews.
[01:58:17.325 --> 01:58:19.207]  This has changed so many people's lives.
[01:58:19.287 --> 01:58:19.467]  Yes.
[01:58:19.847 --> 01:58:20.768]  It is amazing.
[01:58:20.828 --> 01:58:24.290]  And when you don't have the good halogen, folks, the bad halogens get into your glands.
[01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:26.011]  It totally changes your whole system.
[01:58:26.111 --> 01:58:27.032]  Experience it for yourself.
[01:58:27.112 --> 01:58:30.054]  A lot of people detox in about three weeks, so be careful when you're on it.
[01:58:30.074 --> 01:58:32.736]  I would take it slow, take about a half dose the first month or so.
[01:58:32.836 --> 01:58:36.298]  It made me lazy, though, because I used to work out really hard and weigh 30, 40 more pounds.
[01:58:36.418 --> 01:58:44.544]  As soon as I went on this, I just don't have to work out as much anymore, and I don't get fat, even though I'm older, just because of what it did to my whole system, my whole metabolic system.
[01:58:44.804 --> 01:58:45.144]  I think so.
[01:59:04.528 --> 01:59:12.610]  Person-to-person, mouth-to-mouth, ear-to-ear, you are breaking their attempt to have an iron curtain come down across this country.
[01:59:13.010 --> 01:59:14.271]  But they are pressing hard.
[01:59:14.291 --> 01:59:19.392]  It's a very dangerous game because it's exposing their tyranny to everyone.
[01:59:19.712 --> 01:59:21.593]  And Trump is beginning to move against them.
[01:59:21.773 --> 01:59:23.875]  We've got to keep him in there to do that, and he's got to know.
[01:59:23.935 --> 01:59:30.520]  They're shutting down the grassroots that is 90% of Trump's power ahead of the midterms.
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:35.824]  They are coming, not just for Trump, but for the First Amendment now, and I cannot raise the alarm enough.
[01:59:36.124 --> 01:59:39.327]  They think you're just going to incrementally censor, you're going to get sick of hearing about it, just go to sleep.
[01:59:39.447 --> 01:59:46.492]  Folks, they've been persecuting the churches, they've been persecuting the veterans groups, they've been persecuting anybody that's a patriot, and now they're going to the next level.
[01:59:46.532 --> 01:59:49.475]  We can't roll over to this intimidation or we'll lose everything!
[01:59:54.457 --> 01:59:58.559]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:00.421]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:12.508 --> 02:00:19.332]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:00:19.832 --> 02:00:21.233]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:38.742]  All right, we got a very popular political commentator who's really smart, Ali Alexander of AmericanPriority.com, joining us coming up to talk Roseanne Barr, to take more of your calls on that subject, the crackdowns on free speech.
[02:00:38.822 --> 02:00:39.782]  It's all coming up.
[02:00:40.363 --> 02:00:41.483]  Right now, thanks for holding.
[02:00:41.563 --> 02:00:42.944]  I appreciate you calling in.
[02:00:42.964 --> 02:00:43.664]  I'm very, very thankful.
[02:00:44.304 --> 02:00:46.465]  John in Pennsylvania, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:46.765]  Go ahead.
[02:00:47.685 --> 02:00:48.946]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[02:00:48.966 --> 02:00:50.807]  I am actually thrilled.
[02:00:50.867 --> 02:00:53.088]  In fact, I've got goosebumps talking to you.
[02:00:53.588 --> 02:00:54.969]  I just got my InfoWars hat.
[02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:56.489]  Thank you for the bumper stickers.
[02:00:56.509 --> 02:00:59.571]  They're being well received up here in upstate PA.
[02:00:59.811 --> 02:01:00.331]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:00.511 --> 02:01:01.452]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:01.652 --> 02:01:07.815]  What I'd like to point out and tell you, especially, you know, my mouth to your ear, is that
[02:01:08.516 --> 02:01:12.237]  Especially now, we've got the Tommy Robinson thing going on.
[02:01:12.417 --> 02:01:15.297]  Now, I know in England they have the Magna Carta.
[02:01:15.797 --> 02:01:20.458]  Here we have the Constitution that was supposedly muddled after that.
[02:01:21.198 --> 02:01:26.059]  But we have our Bill of Rights, because we are a republic.
[02:01:26.239 --> 02:01:31.820]  Everybody I hear, even on Infowars, says we are... Says democracy.
[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:34.601]  We are not a total democracy, we are a representative republic.
[02:01:35.923 --> 02:01:39.966]  Yes, we are a republic, but nobody ever points that out.
[02:01:40.106 --> 02:01:41.087]  No, I need to do it more.
[02:01:41.107 --> 02:01:46.671]  I think I should cut a promo where I explain that democracy, pure democracy, is two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:53.935]  The first democracies in Greece, they would have, you know, one bucket of white rocks, one bucket of black rocks, whoever got the most, you know, yay or nay.
[02:01:54.336 --> 02:01:57.538]  They would vote routinely to kill somebody who they didn't like what they said.
[02:01:58.058 --> 02:02:01.160]  So in a pure democracy, 51% could vote to kill the other 49%.
[02:02:01.581 --> 02:02:04.603]  People knew what it was.
[02:02:05.248 --> 02:02:08.097]  They would never say, I want to live in a democracy.
[02:02:08.438 --> 02:02:11.628]  But we may need to have it pointed out.
[02:02:12.333 --> 02:02:17.637]  That we are a republic so that we can defend ourselves someday and not end up... That's right.
[02:02:17.977 --> 02:02:27.423]  We have a Bill of Rights, we have a republican form of government, a federalist system, it's a limited democracy, and it's set up with game rules to protect the minority as well as the majority.
[02:02:27.743 --> 02:02:29.604]  We have the best form of government in the world.
[02:02:30.725 --> 02:02:34.267]  We've had a lot of problems, a lot of corruption, but the ideals in our system are the best.
[02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:41.252]  That's why it's under attack by these multinational corporations that pay no tax, are totally lawless, and are tax-exempt, and have diplomatic immunity.
[02:02:41.992 --> 02:02:43.073]  They are the enemy of the system.
[02:02:43.093 --> 02:02:43.833]  They want to destroy it.
[02:02:44.734 --> 02:02:50.757]  You are the only one with the audience big enough to actually start to wake people up.
[02:02:50.817 --> 02:02:54.200]  Sir, I used to hammer the hell out of the Democracy vs. Republic deal.
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:58.262]  And I just, when you've done it 10,000 times, you sound preachy, but you're right.
[02:02:59.663 --> 02:03:01.724]  We are a republic, not a democracy.
[02:03:01.844 --> 02:03:02.905]  There is a big difference.
[02:03:02.985 --> 02:03:04.646]  And you're absolutely on target.
[02:03:05.655 --> 02:03:10.819]  Could you possibly someday actually entertain the idea of being back on the shortwave?
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:14.062]  It might be in yours and everybody else's.
[02:03:14.102 --> 02:03:15.163]  Back on the shortwave?
[02:03:15.603 --> 02:03:15.924]  Yeah.
[02:03:16.584 --> 02:03:22.129]  Instead of, I mean, if you get cut off of YouTube... Last time I checked, I'm still paying to be on shortwave.
[02:03:22.209 --> 02:03:23.350]  Are we not on there?
[02:03:24.683 --> 02:03:29.746]  I used to listen to you, I think, on WWCR, but now that I got you on YouTube, it's a lot better.
[02:03:29.926 --> 02:03:31.427]  I can see your smiling face.
[02:03:32.127 --> 02:03:33.068]  God, I feel sorry for you.
[02:03:33.208 --> 02:03:33.608]  You're nice.
[02:03:33.969 --> 02:03:34.269]  Thank you.
[02:03:34.289 --> 02:03:34.809]  God bless you.
[02:03:34.829 --> 02:03:36.770]  Sometimes I get sick of myself, but thank you so much, John.
[02:03:37.431 --> 02:03:47.177]  I believe we're on WWCR because that's one of the things I just pay each month to be on there six hours a day because I get letters from missionaries and people in Africa and folks listening and a lot of folks in the middle of nowhere.
[02:03:47.237 --> 02:03:48.958]  Listen, we better be on there.
[02:03:50.359 --> 02:03:55.603]  You guys go call WWCR, just call the number off their deal and ask when we're on, or check with accounting and make sure I'm paying for that.
[02:03:56.184 --> 02:03:58.186]  We pay for a lot of satellites, a lot of other stuff.
[02:03:58.206 --> 02:04:04.311]  There's been some mom-and-pop stations that we've been on, you know, 15, 16, 17 years, that I send a little check to each month.
[02:04:04.871 --> 02:04:06.492]  We may actually have to stop doing that, though.
[02:04:06.532 --> 02:04:11.176]  These lawsuits and, you know, their plans to shut us down go further, but hopefully that's not the case.
[02:04:11.196 --> 02:04:17.661]  But yeah, I'm putting all the coal in the engine here to get the water boiling, to get the pistons going, or to get the wheels turning.
[02:04:18.678 --> 02:04:27.001]  So that we can go full attack speed, and the satellites, we're getting a lot of new TV stations, a lot of new radio stations, a lot of new cable systems.
[02:04:27.522 --> 02:04:34.164]  But those are new listeners getting used to us, so they're not really buying a lot of stuff, but we're reaching people, we're getting contacts from them, and that's what matters.
[02:04:34.224 --> 02:04:41.567]  It's our original hardcore audience that, despite all the attacks, like a lighthouse out on that promontory, that makes it all possible.
[02:04:41.587 --> 02:04:43.648]  So without you, we would not be here, so I want to thank you all.
[02:04:44.048 --> 02:04:46.350]  More calls straight ahead, and then Allie Alexander.
[02:04:46.810 --> 02:04:54.957]  Don't forget, we make it easy to support InfoWars with the top-of-the-line supplements, and we've got free shipping on all our best-selling items right now for Memorial Week Special.
[02:04:54.977 --> 02:04:56.158]  It's gonna end soon.

[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.701]  Stay with us.
[02:04:59.721 --> 02:05:01.923]  You don't want to miss what's coming up.
[02:05:03.864 --> 02:05:04.345]  Now!
[02:05:06.326 --> 02:05:07.648]  They think you're a goldfish!
[02:05:09.298 --> 02:05:11.379]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[02:05:11.639 --> 02:05:12.700]  I believe in you!
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:14.281]  I don't think you're stupid!
[02:05:16.042 --> 02:05:18.944]  One man ever raped a woman!
[02:05:19.264 --> 02:05:20.865]  All genitals were cut off!
[02:05:21.125 --> 02:05:23.546]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[02:05:23.686 --> 02:05:24.907]  And we're not backing down ever!
[02:05:26.168 --> 02:05:27.969]  I wanna kick these people!
[02:05:27.989 --> 02:05:28.529]  We're winning!
[02:05:28.569 --> 02:05:29.670]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:30.290]  Can't you?
[02:05:30.590 --> 02:05:32.231]  We have broken their back!
[02:05:32.571 --> 02:05:33.752]  Yes, I can feel it!
[02:05:37.594 --> 02:05:38.095]  Let's go!
[02:05:39.525 --> 02:05:39.665]  Come on!

[02:06:00.041 --> 02:06:00.221]  Come on
[02:06:15.015 --> 02:06:21.271]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:26.673 --> 02:06:29.415]  We are back now into our number three.
[02:06:29.596 --> 02:06:30.877]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:31.037 --> 02:06:37.202]  Ali Alexander is a political consultant, philosopher, and activist, an organizer of AmericanPriority.com.
[02:06:37.782 --> 02:06:46.290]  He has been consulting for Republican campaigns and conservative issues for 11 years at the national level, but now he is much more interested in philosophy and building a better society.
[02:06:46.930 --> 02:06:55.958]  And it's at patreon.com forward slash Ali Alexander, Twitter at Ali, well that's a coveted at Twitter, and organizer at AmericanPriority.com.
[02:06:56.019 --> 02:06:56.899]  I love that name.
[02:06:57.920 --> 02:07:08.910]  I love the clips and things I've seen of him over the years and I'm just glad we've got him here with us today to talk about where he sees us as a philosopher and as a political consultant at this moment in time.
[02:07:09.431 --> 02:07:12.734]  If the enemy wrote the history books, or if we wrote the history books in the future,
[02:07:14.262 --> 02:07:15.624]  What you would call this period.
[02:07:15.864 --> 02:07:17.266]  I think it's the second Great Awakening.
[02:07:18.467 --> 02:07:20.590]  The true launch of the Renaissance.
[02:07:21.311 --> 02:07:25.235]  That what we've seen the last 500 years, all the problems but also the good things, was the detonator.
[02:07:25.956 --> 02:07:29.039]  And so now we're gonna see exploding towards that singularity.
[02:07:29.340 --> 02:07:31.522]  And if we just make it through the next 30-40 years, I think
[02:07:33.024 --> 02:07:37.905]  We're going to look back on this time as right before the new golden age.
[02:07:38.626 --> 02:07:41.946]  I agree with Scott Adams and others, and a lot of people in the establishment realize that.
[02:07:42.286 --> 02:07:42.987]  They cover control.
[02:07:43.027 --> 02:07:44.367]  But maybe I'm wrong.
[02:07:44.707 --> 02:07:49.929]  And then we'll look at Roseanne Barr and, oh, I was on Ambien or I got multiple personalities.
[02:07:49.989 --> 02:07:51.049]  Why is she backing off?
[02:07:51.946 --> 02:07:58.908]  From a joke, they've caricatured me as an ape, Trump as an orangutan, George W. as a chimpanzee.
[02:07:59.188 --> 02:08:02.269]  Because, I mean, let's face it, Trump's hair, when it was orange, looks like orangutan colored.
[02:08:02.849 --> 02:08:09.091]  I mean, I've actually told, I mean, I've had girlfriends before, they get their hair bleached when it's black or brown.
[02:08:09.171 --> 02:08:09.992]  I'm like, that looks horrible.
[02:08:10.312 --> 02:08:11.472]  Your hair looks like an orangutan.
[02:08:11.892 --> 02:08:13.333]  I mean, brunette should not bleach their hair.
[02:08:13.353 --> 02:08:14.213]  It looks like an orangutan.
[02:08:14.973 --> 02:08:17.535]  Now, Trump, I guess, is just bad coloring, but I mean, I don't care.
[02:08:17.575 --> 02:08:18.656]  I kind of like his orange hair.
[02:08:19.336 --> 02:08:20.457]  It's a funny trademark.
[02:08:20.497 --> 02:08:23.139]  So we're going to cover the field here.
[02:08:23.819 --> 02:08:26.140]  Thank you so much for joining us today, sir.
[02:08:26.221 --> 02:08:27.281]  It's good to have you on board with us.
[02:08:28.022 --> 02:08:28.782]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:08:28.922 --> 02:08:30.804]  It's nice to finally connect.
[02:08:32.184 --> 02:08:35.687]  Well, you heard me lay out the buffet, and you've got a million points I know you can cover.
[02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:38.909]  What do you want to tackle first, where we are in history or the whole Roseanne thing?
[02:08:39.606 --> 02:08:41.869]  Let's talk about Roseanne, because she's under fire.
[02:08:41.949 --> 02:08:49.597]  In fact, just in the past half hour, one of our mutual opponents, Ben Shapiro, is giving Roseanne hell.
[02:08:49.637 --> 02:08:51.719]  He's talking crap about me on the podcast.
[02:08:51.799 --> 02:08:54.302]  Right now, live, he's talking crap about you.
[02:08:54.842 --> 02:09:00.345]  And what we really need to protect is free speech, free thought, free expression, and free association.
[02:09:00.385 --> 02:09:04.166]  So that's why I'm here on InfoWars, because we've got to start talking.
[02:09:04.206 --> 02:09:12.350]  We cannot let the oligarchs and the people that, you know, Ben Shapiro is associated with control our thoughts or what we do or who we associate with.
[02:09:13.035 --> 02:09:20.880]  Yeah, I love it how the left is always policing who you can talk to, who you can associate with, always misrepresenting who they're demonizing.
[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:24.623]  They want to be the policeman of discussion, the thought police.
[02:09:24.703 --> 02:09:28.766]  And it's just Shapiro's always popping up saying, Alex Jones is bad.
[02:09:29.086 --> 02:09:30.226]  Don't go on his show.
[02:09:30.907 --> 02:09:32.188]  Roseanne's not a conservative.
[02:09:32.208 --> 02:09:35.170]  Well, I mean, I tend to agree, but he's saying, you know, she's a bad person.
[02:09:35.550 --> 02:09:38.472]  All this crap or what she said was racist when it clearly wasn't.
[02:09:38.812 --> 02:09:42.495]  And so that's my issue, is that he's propped up by some Texas billionaires.
[02:09:42.535 --> 02:09:42.815]  Fine.
[02:09:43.155 --> 02:09:44.719]  But the guy is not self-made.
[02:09:44.919 --> 02:09:45.981]  He couldn't build anything.
[02:09:46.322 --> 02:09:50.330]  And I'm just tired of him now becoming the new Glenn Beck trying to be in our business.
[02:09:51.277 --> 02:09:53.958]  Yeah, look, I dropped out of college twice.
[02:09:54.138 --> 02:10:08.523]  I went to Bible College in Dallas, dropped out, went to University of North Texas in Denton, dropped out, started my business in 2006-2007, hit it big when digital was coming to Republican campaigns.
[02:10:08.543 --> 02:10:13.665]  So I've been really fortunate and blessed to be good at what I've done, and I've largely been behind the scenes.
[02:10:14.745 --> 02:10:15.946]  Hacks like John McCain.
[02:10:16.026 --> 02:10:18.849]  I made Christine O'Donnell the household name.
[02:10:19.489 --> 02:10:25.414]  The Tea Party challenged the Republican Party in New York 23, if you remember way back in New York 23.
[02:10:25.735 --> 02:10:28.317]  That was really the birth of the Tea Party movement.
[02:10:28.337 --> 02:10:31.580]  So you're a successful intellectual in the launch of the new renaissance.
[02:10:32.250 --> 02:10:41.272]  Yeah, and I'm a black, I'm a biracial black Arab in the Republican Party, but Ben Shapiro has been, you know, kind of cultivated since he was 14.
[02:10:41.332 --> 02:10:50.814]  He has all these major foundations paying him $10,000, $20,000 to speak at these colleges while he's trying to de-platform people like you or Milo Yiannopoulos.
[02:10:51.174 --> 02:10:54.774]  It's absolutely batshit crazy and I'm not going to tolerate it anymore.
[02:10:54.814 --> 02:10:57.895]  It's time for people to start pushing against the thought police.
[02:10:58.035 --> 02:10:58.395]  Exactly.
[02:10:58.415 --> 02:10:59.116]  He's there to gatekeep.
[02:10:59.136 --> 02:11:01.319]  That's why all the leftist groups fund him.
[02:11:01.339 --> 02:11:02.840]  To keep conservatives and liberals...
[02:11:13.312 --> 02:11:21.876]  Exactly, to keep loyal opposition, to keep liberals and conservatives apart, and to make sure that libertarian renaissance ideas of taking humanity forward don't come together.
[02:11:22.096 --> 02:11:27.538]  He's a total gatekeeper calling for us to be censored while he's financed by the universities.
[02:11:27.778 --> 02:11:29.399]  He is a shameful person.
[02:11:29.559 --> 02:11:37.142]  And the reason we raise him is he's just such a created artificial commodity who thinks he's our God.
[02:11:37.322 --> 02:11:41.864]  But when you go to his own website that has some great articles, most of the comments hate his guts.
[02:11:41.924 --> 02:11:42.724]  So what does that tell you?
[02:11:43.948 --> 02:11:45.690]  It tells me that he's out of touch.
[02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:52.196]  You know, he might make a fine publisher and he's got encyclopedic knowledge about politics and current events.
[02:11:52.437 --> 02:11:55.580]  But have you ever heard, I mean, you know, Alex, you've been in this longer than I have.
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.681]  I've been in it for 11 years.
[02:11:56.701 --> 02:12:00.344]  But have we ever heard an original thought from Ben Shapiro?
[02:12:00.384 --> 02:12:02.186]  I've heard original thoughts from Mike Cernovich.
[02:12:02.326 --> 02:12:05.650]  No, he, I mean, for me, he is the king of plagiarism.
[02:12:07.110 --> 02:12:09.352]  Well, you know, that may be true, too.
[02:12:09.432 --> 02:12:21.902]  An intellectual plagiarist, that's all I'm saying, because so many things I've heard him say I know are from other famous philosophers and others, which is fine, but just be clear that when I quote Cicero, I tell people it's Cicero, or I quote Nietzsche, I tell people it's Nietzsche.
[02:12:22.799 --> 02:12:23.800]  Yeah.
[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:25.182]  And that's very, very true.
[02:12:25.202 --> 02:12:28.285]  And I think that what you're doing is you're hitting the nail on the head.
[02:12:28.625 --> 02:12:35.713]  He's misguiding some of these youth, you know, these college youth that, you know, worship him and worship Milo and can't understand where the beef is.
[02:12:35.733 --> 02:12:37.615]  They're like, hey, you guys all need to get along.
[02:12:37.635 --> 02:12:43.421]  Well, we can't get along when Ben Shapiro is trying to de-platform us and steal everyone else's ideas.
[02:12:43.702 --> 02:12:44.903]  In what other era
[02:12:45.043 --> 02:12:53.587]  That's right, I mean I've talked to, I mean just off record, it wasn't an off record discussion, but I've had off record discussions as well with other people, but like Shapiro's in everybody's business.
[02:12:53.667 --> 02:12:56.248]  He's the one that basically ran Yiannopoulos out of Breitbart.
[02:12:56.668 --> 02:12:58.069]  He was always trying to get rid of him.
[02:12:58.269 --> 02:13:02.431]  He didn't want more good people at Breitbart to win, he wanted to be in total control.
[02:13:03.091 --> 02:13:06.313]  Makes me sick, he's got that narcissist psycho look in his eye.
[02:13:07.079 --> 02:13:11.760]  Yeah, well, after this appearance, what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to send him an email.
[02:13:12.101 --> 02:13:13.641]  I'm going to offer him peace.
[02:13:13.761 --> 02:13:15.902]  If he doesn't want peace, we're going to war.
[02:13:16.002 --> 02:13:20.203]  I can talk about how he and his friends have stopped the friends of Abe from meeting.
[02:13:20.523 --> 02:13:25.945]  I can talk about how he skipped out on Andrew Breitbart, who is a mutual friend of ours, obviously.
[02:13:27.185 --> 02:13:30.366]  I can talk about how he skipped out on one of Andrew Breitbart's memorials.
[02:13:31.066 --> 02:13:33.947]  In Washington, D.C., a party that I threw where everyone else was there.
[02:13:34.007 --> 02:13:34.747]  Steve was there.
[02:13:34.807 --> 02:13:35.507]  Larry was there.
[02:13:35.727 --> 02:13:37.067]  The entire Breitbart team was there.
[02:13:37.087 --> 02:13:41.748]  But Ben Shapiro couldn't make it on time and then wanted to break fire code when he came up.
[02:13:41.968 --> 02:13:46.229]  So we can start a war with Ben Shapiro if he really, really wants one.
[02:13:46.249 --> 02:13:49.050]  But what I want is I want more voices, not less.
[02:13:49.410 --> 02:13:51.971]  And he wants less voices and he wants to say who can talk to who.
[02:13:51.991 --> 02:13:54.151]  So the only reason we brought him up is because he's not that important.
[02:13:55.291 --> 02:13:56.772]  I guess he's attacking you coming on today.
[02:13:56.792 --> 02:13:57.392]  He thinks he's God?
[02:13:58.192 --> 02:14:06.377]  He's attacking me for defending Roseanne Barr, and it just so happens that it comes at a time when I'm about to appear on your show to talk about Roseanne Barr.
[02:14:06.797 --> 02:14:10.120]  And I'm happy to defend people who aren't racist.
[02:14:10.180 --> 02:14:11.360]  Roseanne is not a racist.
[02:14:11.540 --> 02:14:13.121]  If she was a racist, I would call her out.
[02:14:13.241 --> 02:14:14.502]  Well, I can't believe she's... I agree.
[02:14:14.522 --> 02:14:17.684]  She's falling on her sword like this for making jokes.
[02:14:17.944 --> 02:14:18.585]  I mean, come on.
[02:14:19.349 --> 02:14:19.509]  Yeah.
[02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:23.072]  And Alex, I mean, just like me, you and the audience leveling out.
[02:14:23.153 --> 02:14:28.898]  I didn't think I was going to tell anyone this, but I got on my Periscope, 15,000 people tuned in and I had a confession.
[02:14:28.938 --> 02:14:35.284]  I said, look, I've actually looked at Valerie Jarrett before because she has sunken eyes, a protruded mouth.
[02:14:35.424 --> 02:14:37.385]  This isn't necessarily a black feature.
[02:14:37.646 --> 02:14:39.868]  Ben Stiller, who's a Jewish comedian,
[02:14:40.508 --> 02:14:42.749]  Has the same features and big ears.
[02:14:42.970 --> 02:14:45.591]  There's all kinds of people who look like different characters.
[02:14:45.631 --> 02:14:47.012]  Snoop Dogg looks like a dog.
[02:14:47.032 --> 02:14:54.396]  But I've looked at Valerie Jarrett and I said, wow, she looks like Ari from the reboot of Planet of the Apes in 2001.
[02:14:54.636 --> 02:15:02.560]  And I never wanted to tell anyone that because I am aware of the racial sensitivity and I don't want anyone to go around calling black people monkeys.
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:03.341]  But let's be clear.
[02:15:03.781 --> 02:15:07.483]  Roseanne Barr did not call, did not say that black people look like monkeys.
[02:15:07.743 --> 02:15:10.905]  She didn't even say that Valerie Jarrett looks like a monkey.
[02:15:10.965 --> 02:15:19.869]  She said Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes equal the J. What she was saying is a hodgepodge of beliefs and a look.
[02:15:20.309 --> 02:15:21.650]  And it wasn't sensitive.
[02:15:21.730 --> 02:15:26.254]  She didn't know Valerie Jarrett was 65% black.
[02:15:27.655 --> 02:15:30.517]  But come on, let's just be really, really honest about this.
[02:15:30.917 --> 02:15:35.040]  She wasn't comparing Valerie Jarrett to a monkey because she thinks she's dumb.
[02:15:35.421 --> 02:15:38.883]  Valerie Jarrett is one of the most nefarious people in all of politics.
[02:15:39.224 --> 02:15:41.065]  Well, let's talk about Valerie Jarrett when we come back.
[02:15:41.105 --> 02:15:45.909]  Plus, that picture of Roseanne Barr you just had up, she looks like Ursula from My Little Mermaid.
[02:15:47.637 --> 02:15:53.560]  I'm not trying to be mean to her, but she does kind of look like Ursula, you know, and grabs the wand and steals the voice and everything.
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:55.381]  Ali Alexander is our guest.
[02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:56.181]  He's on fire.
[02:15:56.561 --> 02:15:58.202]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:15:58.242 --> 02:15:59.363]  Your calls are coming up, too.
[02:15:59.843 --> 02:16:00.303]  Stay with us.
[02:16:00.323 --> 02:16:00.964]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:02.905 --> 02:16:17.152]  It was about 25 years ago that I began to read publicly available books that had been written for the State Department and for the CIA by top professors at Georgetown, Harvard, and Yale.
[02:16:19.648 --> 02:16:25.751]  So that the CIA and other agencies could understand the complex political system they were building.
[02:16:27.171 --> 02:16:29.712]  And in short, it was going to be called a technocracy.
[02:16:30.492 --> 02:16:33.914]  But it was going to fund communism and socialism and fascism.
[02:16:34.854 --> 02:16:37.035]  But really what it was, was crony capitalism.
[02:16:38.736 --> 02:16:43.878]  So decades later, after fighting against this, humanity is somewhat awake to the threat.
[02:16:45.851 --> 02:16:52.457]  But at the same time, despite all our successes, changing this paradigm really is an inside job.
[02:16:53.438 --> 02:16:54.439]  It's up to us personally.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:17:02.686]  So, I don't feel sorry for myself being demonized by mainstream media and being attacked and the globalists filing frivolous lawsuits.
[02:17:03.186 --> 02:17:04.488]  I expected that to happen.
[02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:06.990]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:17:08.976 --> 02:17:19.925]  I just wanna make sure that you, the listeners, and you, the viewers, many of you already understand this, so I'm not patronizing those of you that are already awake, but I wanna make sure all of you realize this isn't just some more entertainment.
[02:17:20.625 --> 02:17:22.147]  This isn't just some other talking head.
[02:17:22.847 --> 02:17:34.476]  The reason they hate what we cover is because I and others have researched what they actually are planning, and it is nightmarish, it is authoritarian, it is eugenics-based, it is anti-human.
[02:17:35.057 --> 02:17:37.259]  And we've already come so far together
[02:17:38.274 --> 02:17:47.277]  That I know that if each and every one of you will just go research these issues for yourself, you will find out how real it is and understand it's not your duty.
[02:17:47.857 --> 02:17:53.279]  It is your basic survival to stand up against this anti-human onslaught.
[02:17:54.399 --> 02:18:02.261]  If you go back into history, it was 3% that volunteered for the Revolutionary War back in 1776.
[02:18:04.522 --> 02:18:12.785]  But if you look at the InfoWars audience, it's maybe 10% of the United States, another 10% or so worldwide.
[02:18:13.305 --> 02:18:14.745]  I think that's a conservative estimate.
[02:18:15.746 --> 02:18:18.406]  But we have 50, 60, 70 million people listening.
[02:18:19.207 --> 02:18:21.027]  We have more than that that have tuned in over the years.
[02:18:21.067 --> 02:18:25.949]  The point is, is that if you look at that, that's less than 3% of the world population.
[02:18:27.069 --> 02:18:37.838]  So what you're doing has already changed the world and instead of sitting here and going into each product and telling you how great they are, I'm just going to encourage you to go research them yourselves because you're funding our operation.
[02:18:37.878 --> 02:18:41.841]  Just like our information has changed the world, any products we sell
[02:18:43.268 --> 02:18:43.908]  Our game changing.
[02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:45.849]  MycoZX, sold out for months.
[02:18:46.029 --> 02:18:47.190]  The other equation of probiotic.
[02:18:47.250 --> 02:18:50.811]  It's now stronger and a lower price in FullWorthStore.com.
[02:18:51.132 --> 02:18:52.232]  We've got the Real Red Pill.
[02:18:52.312 --> 02:18:56.674]  It's got preglanone, that is a base natural hormone precursor in the body.
[02:18:57.214 --> 02:19:00.256]  Then all the different vitamins and minerals, amino acids.
[02:19:00.356 --> 02:19:01.576]  It just does incredible things.
[02:19:01.997 --> 02:19:03.457]  Look into the Real Red Pill for yourself.
[02:19:03.477 --> 02:19:06.459]  And then we have a new addition to the Super Blue family of products.
[02:19:06.479 --> 02:19:09.000]  You know about our best-selling fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:19:09.540 --> 02:19:14.343]  That's 4 to 5 of colloidal silver and iodine, other key compounds that are so good for your gums and teeth.
[02:19:14.983 --> 02:19:26.110]  We now have, not just the mouthwash, but Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle Mouth Spray that is concentrated with one of the strongest patented forms of colloidal silver out there.

[02:20:09.073 --> 02:20:24.820]  If you are receiving this transmission, you're part of the cutting-edge, worldwide revolution against collectivism.

[02:20:30.387 --> 02:20:34.311]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:20:35.372 --> 02:20:40.116]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:40.856 --> 02:20:46.441]  Allie Alexander is our guest, political consultant, analyst, talk show host, you name it.
[02:20:47.282 --> 02:20:49.244]  Patreon.com forward slash Ali Alexander.
[02:20:49.284 --> 02:20:50.845]  Twitter at A-L-I.
[02:20:50.865 --> 02:20:54.388]  That's an amazingly good Twitter handle right there, isn't it?
[02:20:54.468 --> 02:20:57.191]  And the point is, is that he's been private until recently.
[02:20:57.211 --> 02:21:02.635]  He's been a behind-the-scenes political guru for the whole kind of Trump wave you're seeing, but even before that...
[02:21:03.496 --> 02:21:13.084]  He's worked for a public establishment and now he more and more is going public to great fanfare and to a lot of support, kind of blasting onto the scene even though he's been behind the scenes for a while.
[02:21:13.545 --> 02:21:17.468]  Why did you feel that this last year or so is the time for you to do this?
[02:21:17.488 --> 02:21:20.591]  Because what, the ultimate culture war is now manifesting or why?
[02:21:21.551 --> 02:21:24.314]  Yeah, we are, you know, Alex you hit, you know,
[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:30.926]  Your readers may not know how well read you are, how you, you know, spend time, you know, studying these topics when you're not on air.
[02:21:30.946 --> 02:21:39.774]  You and I have a number, even though we've never met, we have a number of mutual friends, so I've heard, you know, the rumors, but we really are 40 or 50 years from determining
[02:21:40.354 --> 02:21:47.238]  Whether we will live as corporate slaves, or whether we can be free and peaceful around the world.
[02:21:47.659 --> 02:21:52.742]  And so, what I thought is that the MAGA movement needed somebody who knew what Ben knew.
[02:21:53.222 --> 02:21:56.744]  Edmund Burke, Russell Kirk, you know, traditional conservatism.
[02:21:57.065 --> 02:22:03.509]  Someone, the MAGA movement needed somebody to guide them through, okay, well what does the repeal process of Obamacare look like?
[02:22:03.809 --> 02:22:08.332]  Because there are people who are lying to the President, and I had to get on Periscope and
[02:22:09.052 --> 02:22:12.576]  Make sure that the White House Comms Department was putting stuff on the president's desk.
[02:22:13.017 --> 02:22:22.647]  And so, you know, I'm willing to burn down my career because if we all pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, our honor, then I think we can save this country.
[02:22:23.068 --> 02:22:25.491]  And the world, because the globalists know they have us, they win.
[02:22:25.511 --> 02:22:26.171]  For those that don't know...
[02:22:26.832 --> 02:22:29.012]  Obamacare written to screw everybody over.
[02:22:29.052 --> 02:22:29.933]  Trump's destroying that.
[02:22:30.293 --> 02:22:35.774]  This new thing he did, this right to fight for your life, this right to try.
[02:22:36.194 --> 02:22:40.155]  Think about how the left's fighting that when they're saying, have the right to commit suicide.
[02:22:40.175 --> 02:22:40.955]  Well, I'm a libertarian.
[02:22:40.995 --> 02:22:44.576]  I say, okay, if you don't have the state involved, that's where I say I'll fight to the death against it.
[02:22:44.836 --> 02:22:45.776]  That's what Bill Gates pushes.
[02:22:45.796 --> 02:22:48.377]  But now they're all pissed about the right to try.
[02:22:48.457 --> 02:22:49.777]  What is wrong with these people?
[02:22:50.458 --> 02:22:50.998]  Big Pharma.
[02:22:51.439 --> 02:22:52.019]  Big Pharma.
[02:22:52.279 --> 02:22:56.601]  It's the same thing that's wrong with, you know, when the Riddleman comments were made the other day.
[02:22:56.621 --> 02:23:03.705]  It's the same thing that's wrong why the Ambien, the parent company of Ambien, attacked Roseanne Barr today.
[02:23:04.065 --> 02:23:07.347]  They want us... I mean, I wish this was a conspiracy.
[02:23:07.467 --> 02:23:08.628]  I'm not a conspiracist.
[02:23:08.868 --> 02:23:10.709]  There's a lot of stuff... It's an open conspiracy!
[02:23:11.389 --> 02:23:18.191]  It's an open conspiracy that CNN would not survive without Big Pharma, period.
[02:23:18.651 --> 02:23:24.193]  And so what they don't want is, I'll tell you Alex, I actually made a lot of money when Trump got elected.
[02:23:24.253 --> 02:23:24.453]  Why?
[02:23:24.473 --> 02:23:28.234]  Because the next day I got up and I bought an ETF called Labu.
[02:23:28.494 --> 02:23:32.956]  Now this is not investment advice, I'm not talking about the timing now, but the day after the election,
[02:23:33.716 --> 02:23:36.117]  I bought a ton of Labu.
[02:23:36.157 --> 02:23:39.118]  It's an ETF that puts together a lot of biotech stocks.
[02:23:39.178 --> 02:23:39.418]  Why?
[02:23:39.698 --> 02:23:47.621]  Because I was listening to the president and he said, I'm going to war with the FDA because we're going to reduce drug prices, but I'm not going to let you be dependent on it.
[02:23:47.881 --> 02:23:50.902]  What Trump is doing is absolutely genius.
[02:23:51.242 --> 02:23:56.123]  He wants there to be more available, cheaper drugs, but he doesn't want anyone dependent on them.
[02:23:56.324 --> 02:23:57.624]  We have not seen a president
[02:23:57.984 --> 02:24:04.608]  Who is this empathetic and this knowledgeable about how policy affects people and societies and communities, uh, maybe ever.
[02:24:05.288 --> 02:24:10.271]  I was about to say, he is, he is so incredibly empathetic.
[02:24:10.852 --> 02:24:11.052]  Yeah.
[02:24:11.412 --> 02:24:15.795]  And, and then when you really study the policy, it, what he ends up doing is so good.
[02:24:16.315 --> 02:24:17.516]  So what did he get Congress to do?
[02:24:17.556 --> 02:24:18.216]  It'd be even better.
[02:24:18.236 --> 02:24:19.297]  And like he said today,
[02:24:20.117 --> 02:24:21.638]  I said, I don't care what bill you get through.
[02:24:21.658 --> 02:24:23.099]  I want the bill that's the best for the people.
[02:24:23.479 --> 02:24:25.720]  And I want real experts on that that aren't from big pharma.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:27.201]  And I want wide spectrum analysis.
[02:24:27.481 --> 02:24:29.002]  And he said, I don't care what they think.
[02:24:29.362 --> 02:24:30.322]  That's why they're so angry.
[02:24:31.143 --> 02:24:31.363]  Yeah.
[02:24:31.623 --> 02:24:31.763]  Yeah.
[02:24:31.803 --> 02:24:34.084]  Because you and I know you're a libertarian.
[02:24:34.124 --> 02:24:34.805]  I'm a conservative.
[02:24:34.845 --> 02:24:40.968]  You and I know that the corporations actually want to limit the competition because then they have a monopoly.
[02:24:41.668 --> 02:24:44.490]  And so the right to try breaks open those doors.
[02:24:46.806 --> 02:24:49.087]  Look, I'm surprised Trump's done this good.
[02:24:49.107 --> 02:24:50.828]  I'm not just a sycophant just groveling.
[02:24:51.148 --> 02:24:55.011]  I was freaked out when my gut told me to endorse him, but I've gone with it and now it's been right.
[02:24:55.171 --> 02:25:02.455]  I can't believe though he's gotten this much done, and I really worry what is the system going to do because they're getting, you know, we see videos now of Fox News hosts
[02:25:02.975 --> 02:25:05.697]  Are having coffee and tea thrown on them at restaurants.
[02:25:05.737 --> 02:25:06.357]  Not just me.
[02:25:06.677 --> 02:25:14.843]  This hate by the crazed cult of the left that aren't even leftists, that are just, just, just, just, just, just crash news junkies.
[02:25:15.123 --> 02:25:22.348]  They are so crazed up and so existentially threatened by us just trying to give them renaissance that I wonder what they're going to do next.
[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:24.801]  It's going to get really, really bad.
[02:25:25.022 --> 02:25:32.968]  I, you know, before the Steve Scalise stuff, I said that it would be a year before the left engaged in radicalized violence.
[02:25:33.169 --> 02:25:33.889]  And I was wrong.
[02:25:33.949 --> 02:25:46.840]  It happened about three months after I gave a predictive analysis that any society that has engaged in this, this is where the people charged with disseminating information hide information about violence from the public.
[02:25:47.241 --> 02:25:48.762]  It allows no chilling effect.
[02:25:49.062 --> 02:25:52.307]  So if you study sociology, you knew this stuff was coming.
[02:25:52.568 --> 02:25:56.073]  And so when the Steve Scalise shooting was coming, well of course it had to happen.
[02:25:56.293 --> 02:26:02.783]  There were organized Mexican gangs, Antifa, and Democrat activists in San Jose in 2016
[02:26:04.245 --> 02:26:07.087]  Who beat the living crap out of Trump supporters.
[02:26:07.127 --> 02:26:12.211]  And that's when I decided, okay, I gotta support this guy because I've sat with Trump.
[02:26:12.231 --> 02:26:13.252]  We've talked in 2014.
[02:26:13.792 --> 02:26:15.133]  They told me that he was going to run.
[02:26:15.193 --> 02:26:17.055]  I didn't believe Sam Nunberg when he told me.
[02:26:17.335 --> 02:26:18.316]  They offered to hire me.
[02:26:18.676 --> 02:26:22.179]  In 2011, I had spent money with the Super PAC against Trump.
[02:26:22.199 --> 02:26:26.082]  So I've spent... By the way, because you're really a real progressive, I would guess that name.
[02:26:26.182 --> 02:26:28.383]  Progressing humanity, not what they're doing trying to take control.
[02:26:28.484 --> 02:26:31.606]  If they start this race war, this won't be good for any common people.
[02:26:32.395 --> 02:26:32.955]  No, it won't.
[02:26:33.115 --> 02:26:33.436]  It won't.
[02:26:33.496 --> 02:26:39.479]  It will lead in utter bloodshed, and then the corporations will promise us to bring us peace, you know?
[02:26:39.699 --> 02:26:44.321]  By total political correctness and school-level brainwashing, you can see him priming it.
[02:26:44.561 --> 02:26:48.443]  George Soros is openly the main funder of the Starbucks brainwashing.
[02:26:48.683 --> 02:26:49.884]  I mean, you can see their plan.
[02:26:50.624 --> 02:26:51.405]  It's not a joke.
[02:26:51.465 --> 02:26:52.625]  It's not an exaggeration.
[02:26:53.006 --> 02:26:58.408]  I am not anyone who's ever peddled any conspiracy or anything like that, any one-off theory.
[02:26:58.669 --> 02:27:01.170]  It's in the WikiLeaks that they want culture war.
[02:27:01.926 --> 02:27:03.107]  They want a culture war.
[02:27:03.147 --> 02:27:04.088]  They want a culture war.
[02:27:04.128 --> 02:27:05.750]  That's how they're going to make their money.
[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:31.551]  I learned, once he was already running from folks, that he'd been drafted by the military that was already thinking about a coup against the globalists, because they were another multinational coup, but they decided, no, let's draft somebody, get behind him, reboot America, we can do it, and then this has all happened.
[02:27:31.571 --> 02:27:37.715]  So now the FBI has gone from claiming we're Russians, to now behind the scenes they think Roger Schoen and I were not even involved in any of this.
[02:27:38.712 --> 02:27:44.379]  Higher-level Pentagon people are now trying to claim we're the mastermind of an American coup against the Democrats.
[02:27:44.659 --> 02:27:48.504]  So at least now at the rubber-meets-the-road level, 13 people have been questioned.
[02:27:48.764 --> 02:27:52.889]  They're segwaying away from Russia to, okay, who's the American cabal?
[02:27:52.929 --> 02:27:56.273]  Well, it's an open conspiracy of people that don't want to be slaves.
[02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.330]  Right.
[02:27:57.690 --> 02:27:58.831]  And that's the truth.
[02:27:58.891 --> 02:27:59.772]  And we're fighting back.
[02:27:59.872 --> 02:28:04.375]  And we as Americans are promised in our Constitution that we can take any stance on any policy.
[02:28:04.695 --> 02:28:05.836]  And that's not sedition.
[02:28:05.876 --> 02:28:07.537]  That doesn't violate the Logan Act.
[02:28:07.757 --> 02:28:12.881]  It's entirely crazy what a faction inside the DOJ and the deep state are doing.
[02:28:13.181 --> 02:28:16.643]  But thank God for Trump because now we have more whistleblowers than ever.
[02:28:16.683 --> 02:28:23.007]  And after the break, I want to get more into that because the people who are doing the hard work are the whistleblowers at the DOJ.
[02:28:23.067 --> 02:28:26.710]  And thank God Trump is creating this spectacle in the public that's providing.
[02:28:27.090 --> 02:28:30.771]  So on target, Ali, because they make it like we're against the FBI, the DOJ.
[02:28:30.911 --> 02:28:36.834]  No, we're against the Clinton criminal cancer cabal, less than one-tenth of one percent, running the whole show.
[02:28:37.134 --> 02:28:48.658]  And it is the FBI, and it is the DOJ, and it is the CIA, and it is the Pentagon that is helping the American people try to remove this, because finally they understood that the country was about to be completely ended by Hillary.
[02:28:48.918 --> 02:28:50.259]  She was going to sell us out to China.
[02:28:50.419 --> 02:28:51.119]  It was over.
[02:28:51.539 --> 02:28:52.721]  So what were they going to do?
[02:28:53.142 --> 02:28:55.505]  When they lost, they freaked out and said, we're not giving up.
[02:28:55.926 --> 02:28:58.831]  We're going to call Trump a Russian and flip the script on them.
[02:28:58.891 --> 02:29:00.133]  We'll be back with Ali Alexander.
[02:29:04.947 --> 02:29:23.258]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, and I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[02:29:23.338 --> 02:29:28.762]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[02:29:29.622 --> 02:29:30.303]  It's a great deal at $39.
[02:29:30.423 --> 02:29:33.585]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[02:29:34.225 --> 02:29:35.206]  And so much more.
[02:29:35.767 --> 02:29:36.908]  It is concentrated.
[02:29:37.128 --> 02:29:38.829]  You need to go read what is in here.
[02:29:38.849 --> 02:29:44.554]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[02:29:44.654 --> 02:29:45.855]  A citrus peel blend.
[02:29:45.875 --> 02:29:47.817]  I mean, this is the next level.
[02:29:47.897 --> 02:29:50.279]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[02:29:50.479 --> 02:29:51.740]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[02:29:51.920 --> 02:29:53.742]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[02:29:54.282 --> 02:29:54.883]  Immune Wall.
[02:29:55.003 --> 02:29:56.324]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:29:56.444 --> 02:29:57.605]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:30:03.703 --> 02:30:04.444]  I'm so excited.
[02:30:04.504 --> 02:30:14.070]  The new product at Infowarslife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:30:14.650 --> 02:30:19.834]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[02:30:20.154 --> 02:30:22.956]  But boy, does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[02:30:23.156 --> 02:30:31.922]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[02:30:34.043 --> 02:30:53.128]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[02:30:53.628 --> 02:30:54.928]  It is amazing!
[02:30:56.309 --> 02:31:01.290]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:31:03.829 --> 02:31:08.413]  Patrick, in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:31:08.433 --> 02:31:08.933]  Thanks for holding.
[02:31:08.993 --> 02:31:09.894]  Hey Alex, mate.
[02:31:09.914 --> 02:31:14.077]  I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now.
[02:31:14.097 --> 02:31:22.784]  I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and I had to load down the page on my dial-up internet and I thought it was
[02:31:22.904 --> 02:31:39.058]  Pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all you get and I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield and since then I'm on the X2, the Super Male Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, Micro ZX, Body, it's all amazing.
[02:31:39.558 --> 02:31:48.084]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[02:31:48.164 --> 02:31:52.927]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[02:31:53.067 --> 02:31:58.310]  And I wanted to say that it's an honour to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:32:06.397 --> 02:32:07.778]  Let's talk to Victor in Florida.
[02:32:07.838 --> 02:32:09.279]  Victor, you're calling.
[02:32:09.339 --> 02:32:09.700]  Go ahead.
[02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:10.100]  Yes.
[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:11.241]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:11.361 --> 02:32:17.546]  First, I just want to mention, if people just go and try the products, they will be ordering all the time.
[02:32:17.766 --> 02:32:21.750]  I've ordered several of the products over and over because it's amazing.
[02:32:21.990 --> 02:32:23.431]  In particular, Silver Bullet.
[02:32:23.791 --> 02:32:30.497]  As soon as I start to feel like I get a little sick, you know, maybe like a little raspiness in my throat, I drop some Silver Bullet in it.
[02:32:30.577 --> 02:32:33.439]  Like, I'll still feel a little sick, but it won't last as long.
[02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:39.003]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[02:32:39.043 --> 02:32:46.890]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation, because a very small percentage of people buy products, and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products, so thank you.
[02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:52.734]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet Coalital Silver, it's got thousands of reviews, a 98% review.
[02:32:52.854 --> 02:32:58.138]  It is our highest-reviewed product, because it is from the top lab in the country, discounted, high-quality coalital silver.
[02:32:58.158 --> 02:33:01.261]  And it's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.
[02:33:07.259 --> 02:33:10.002]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:21.796 --> 02:33:27.783]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[02:33:29.284 --> 02:33:30.205]  You want answers?
[02:33:31.146 --> 02:33:32.969]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:33.109 --> 02:33:39.436]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:42.480 --> 02:33:45.664]  Ali Alexander made the point about
[02:33:47.176 --> 02:33:51.798]  Close to half of mainstream news' funding is Big Pharma.
[02:33:51.838 --> 02:33:56.019]  When I was famously on Piers Morgan, they admitted the top news event of that year, top ratings.
[02:33:57.060 --> 02:34:00.361]  I was banned everywhere else after that because I was getting people out of the paradigm.
[02:34:00.401 --> 02:34:01.522]  I was shaking them out of their trance.
[02:34:01.822 --> 02:34:12.346]  They admitted that they were going to have me on for most of the hour, but as soon as I, in the second segment, talked about, don't blame American gun owners for some of the shootings, that are very rare but still out of control,
[02:34:13.536 --> 02:34:18.479]  I said, blame the mass murder pills on the inserts of the Prozac class drugs.
[02:34:18.499 --> 02:34:22.722]  It says it can cause you to commit suicide, megalomania, mass murder, you name it.
[02:34:23.042 --> 02:34:26.104]  And boy, they were cutting that segment off at that point.
[02:34:26.404 --> 02:34:28.326]  So here's a piece of that famous footage.
[02:34:28.976 --> 02:34:32.257]  America's number one cause of unnatural death now is suicide.
[02:34:32.817 --> 02:34:37.958]  Not automobile accident, not cancer, not... You excuse me of attacking the Second Amendment of the Constitution.
[02:34:37.978 --> 02:34:42.419]  I want to get people off pills that the insert says would make you commit suicide and kill people!
[02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:44.500]  Alex, let's get a vote to the Second Amendment.
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:46.400]  I want to blame a real culprit!
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:47.620]  Suicide pills!
[02:34:47.941 --> 02:34:48.961]  Mass murder pills!
[02:34:49.021 --> 02:34:50.241]  Okay, let me ask you one question.
[02:34:50.961 --> 02:34:52.102]  You're believing this, I'm wrong.
[02:34:52.162 --> 02:34:53.742]  First time anybody's ever heard this, by the way.
[02:34:55.263 --> 02:34:55.884]  I didn't like that.
[02:34:56.465 --> 02:35:11.062]  So, Alexander, I wanted you to get into, though, behind the scenes, first being told Trump would run 2014-2015, and what was going on behind the scenes, because that's critical for the history we're now witnessing, and then we'll get into the whistleblowers you were talking about and how critical that is.
[02:35:11.815 --> 02:35:16.679]  So in 2014, I was the deputy director of an RNC-sponsored conference.
[02:35:17.059 --> 02:35:18.820]  It was a Republican leadership conference.
[02:35:19.401 --> 02:35:21.763]  And Donald Trump was flying in.
[02:35:22.784 --> 02:35:25.225]  You know, he had some accommodations that he wanted.
[02:35:25.706 --> 02:35:28.548]  And at this point, Alex, I did not like Trump.
[02:35:29.028 --> 02:35:34.473]  Like I said, in 2011, I found a big funder to spend some money to try to keep him out of the primary.
[02:35:34.773 --> 02:35:36.414]  I didn't consider him conservative.
[02:35:37.095 --> 02:35:40.797]  You know, I didn't like his social or moral values.
[02:35:41.718 --> 02:35:49.444]  When I walked in that room, I was hit with this burst of energy, and the dude is one of the most empathetic dudes you will ever meet.
[02:35:49.484 --> 02:35:50.925]  He's an empath, really.
[02:35:51.425 --> 02:35:55.928]  Everyone was so scared, they were standing, and I thought, well, I'm going to show this guy, you know.
[02:35:56.208 --> 02:35:58.790]  And I sat down on the couch, and then he said, you know what?
[02:35:59.231 --> 02:36:00.832]  You look like Sammy Davis Jr.
[02:36:00.972 --> 02:36:02.193]  And I'm sure you know your competition.
[02:36:02.213 --> 02:36:03.273]  Well, exactly.
[02:36:03.574 --> 02:36:04.614]  People look like they look like.
[02:36:04.654 --> 02:36:07.897]  That lady looks like a fish, you look like Sammy Davis Jr., I look like a pumpkin.
[02:36:08.936 --> 02:36:11.978]  I mean, you know, and we're all God's children.
[02:36:12.058 --> 02:36:13.338]  You know, we're all God's children.
[02:36:13.398 --> 02:36:14.799]  Roseanne Barr believes that.
[02:36:14.899 --> 02:36:19.081]  I mean, Roseanne Barr is a Jewish woman who wants peace around the world.
[02:36:19.141 --> 02:36:23.883]  You know, she retweets stuff about Palestinian children and she wants to secure Israel.
[02:36:23.983 --> 02:36:25.743]  And she stood up for Tommy Robinson.
[02:36:26.564 --> 02:36:33.047]  Yeah, so the people think that she has this secret hate in her heart and she's been working in Hollywood for decades.
[02:36:33.367 --> 02:36:34.887]  It's absolutely hogwash.
[02:36:35.087 --> 02:36:36.248]  But anyway, so me and Trump,
[02:36:37.020 --> 02:36:40.684]  This is what I noticed, Alex, is I'm used to writing people's speeches.
[02:36:41.265 --> 02:36:46.190]  Trump had computer paper and a sharpie and was writing his own speech a half hour before.
[02:36:46.250 --> 02:36:47.191]  Oh, that's what's incredible.
[02:36:47.231 --> 02:36:50.394]  With Trump, they go, oh, notice he wrote a letter to a teacher.
[02:36:50.694 --> 02:36:53.117]  They made fun of it because of grammatical errors and things.
[02:36:53.457 --> 02:36:54.959]  Hey, you actually got a letter from him.
[02:36:55.666 --> 02:36:55.926]  Yeah.
[02:36:56.506 --> 02:36:59.387]  People do not know this man is authentic.
[02:36:59.927 --> 02:37:06.568]  And I'm not going to talk about what happened for the next half hour, but I'll say that the dude's memory is very astute.
[02:37:06.828 --> 02:37:14.070]  He quoted four of the most recent state polls within Louisiana because Republicans were divided there.
[02:37:14.110 --> 02:37:15.770]  And he told the candidate to get out of the race.
[02:37:15.810 --> 02:37:17.971]  And I thought, well, here's a man who's empathetic.
[02:37:18.331 --> 02:37:23.673]  He writes his own speeches and cares about the Republican Party getting a majority.
[02:37:23.973 --> 02:37:25.354]  So anyway, he gets on stage.
[02:37:25.874 --> 02:37:26.934]  He gives a rousing speech.
[02:37:26.954 --> 02:37:27.635]  He gets off stage.
[02:37:27.655 --> 02:37:29.395]  He says, Ali, I want to walk.
[02:37:29.696 --> 02:37:30.636]  Where do I have to go now?
[02:37:30.656 --> 02:37:33.417]  I said, well, I have to take you through the kitchen to take you to your press conference.
[02:37:33.757 --> 02:37:35.718]  And he said, no, I want to walk through the crowd.
[02:37:36.238 --> 02:37:37.879]  And I said, well, you're Trump, let's do it.
[02:37:37.959 --> 02:37:47.962]  And we walked through the crowd and the next governor who, our governor, our old governor got on stage and Donald Trump just walked off stage.
[02:37:48.002 --> 02:37:50.523]  Here's all these Louisiana state troopers, me and Trump.
[02:37:50.943 --> 02:37:52.424]  And the crowd just goes like this.
[02:37:52.684 --> 02:37:55.705]  And I realized the man is a strategist's strategist.
[02:37:56.085 --> 02:37:57.288]  And so I took him to Steve Bannon.
[02:37:57.308 --> 02:37:57.869]  He did his hit.
[02:37:57.949 --> 02:38:00.093]  Then we went to the press conference.
[02:38:00.133 --> 02:38:00.734]  We ran that.
[02:38:00.794 --> 02:38:05.984]  He denounced racism and Donald Sterling, you know, the NBA owner.
[02:38:06.185 --> 02:38:06.585]  So anyway.
[02:38:07.299 --> 02:38:09.200]  They were telling me, they said, Oli, we're really gonna run.
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:10.701]  And I said, Sam, you guys aren't running.
[02:38:10.741 --> 02:38:12.022]  This is always a joke with y'all.
[02:38:12.042 --> 02:38:15.544]  But I realized that I needed to rethink how I saw this man.
[02:38:15.884 --> 02:38:19.246]  When Donald Trump did run, I did not support him in the primary.
[02:38:19.526 --> 02:38:33.794]  But when it came to violence, and when I saw that Donald Trump was willing to sit down with Christian leaders and conservative leaders like Mike Pence and James Dobson and... And now you see that he's marching at pro-life events that no Republican's ever done?
[02:38:33.814 --> 02:38:35.175]  I mean, he's the real deal.
[02:38:35.819 --> 02:38:36.660]  He's the real deal.
[02:38:36.720 --> 02:38:38.801]  By the way, it's not a Trump grovel fest here.
[02:38:39.101 --> 02:38:40.282]  He's changed a lot, too.
[02:38:40.382 --> 02:38:41.603]  He's become a lot more Christian.
[02:38:41.943 --> 02:38:43.264]  He's told me that personally.
[02:38:43.284 --> 02:38:47.046]  And he said, no it's true, he said that was never really around all these real churches.
[02:38:47.086 --> 02:38:49.588]  He was around these fake churches that didn't have any energy.
[02:38:50.068 --> 02:38:51.109]  And he loves veterans.
[02:38:51.149 --> 02:38:52.170]  He loves black churches.
[02:38:52.190 --> 02:38:52.850]  He loves everybody.
[02:38:52.870 --> 02:38:56.493]  But that's what Trump, the talks I've had, is what you talk about, boom, the energy.
[02:38:56.913 --> 02:38:58.974]  And then he talks about the energy.
[02:38:59.354 --> 02:39:01.136]  And Trump is all about good energy.
[02:39:01.156 --> 02:39:02.977]  It's not mumbo jumbo.
[02:39:03.397 --> 02:39:05.779]  It's that the left, he picks up an energy of death.
[02:39:06.500 --> 02:39:09.823]  The energy of pro-life and patriots, he picks up the energy of life.
[02:39:10.043 --> 02:39:10.603]  And that's what he gets.
[02:39:10.783 --> 02:39:13.125]  He literally gets charged up by people.
[02:39:13.446 --> 02:39:14.847]  But he's not vampiric.
[02:39:15.087 --> 02:39:16.128]  He charges you up.
[02:39:16.912 --> 02:39:19.513]  Yeah, this is not New Age bullcrap.
[02:39:19.533 --> 02:39:28.316]  This is the study of psychology, and when he was a child, he studied under a pastor who was famous for talking about the power of positivity.
[02:39:28.676 --> 02:39:44.041]  And so in a lot of ways, Trump went decades of his life without authentic Christians and people who wanted to return to localities, back self-governance, and when he finally came to it, like what you said, he's come our way more than we've come his way.
[02:39:44.361 --> 02:39:45.801]  I'm not sick of him!
[02:39:45.821 --> 02:39:48.122]  No, he said publicly and privately, he said, I've changed.
[02:39:48.562 --> 02:39:49.982]  He goes, I know God's real.
[02:39:50.042 --> 02:39:53.103]  He can feel that the energy of Bible believers is the strongest out there.
[02:39:53.963 --> 02:39:55.483]  Yeah, it's absolutely true.
[02:39:55.523 --> 02:40:00.864]  So it's obvious to me that God has a mandate on this man's life.
[02:40:00.925 --> 02:40:02.345]  And this is either going to be... Exactly!
[02:40:02.425 --> 02:40:06.726]  And look how much he scares true evil like Soros and Hillary and people.
[02:40:06.766 --> 02:40:07.766]  They are so scared of him.
[02:40:08.666 --> 02:40:09.387]  Yeah, think about it.
[02:40:09.407 --> 02:40:15.815]  I mean, he can call these nasty MS-13 gangs animals, and the media will defend them.
[02:40:15.855 --> 02:40:17.477]  This isn't about partisan politics.
[02:40:17.797 --> 02:40:27.189]  This is about a social construct that now the right has an opportunity to meme with the left, and the left has had a total monopoly for the past 15 years.
[02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:33.991]  And then Kanye talks about a bigger plan, humanity to the next level, and love, and Trump talks about love today in his speech.
[02:40:34.331 --> 02:40:39.473]  I mean, I think we're really breaking the satanic will of the globalists right now.
[02:40:39.753 --> 02:40:44.175]  And if you don't believe in God, folks, their energy is take, take, take, hate everybody.
[02:40:44.655 --> 02:40:50.096]  Just imagine the worst day you ever had times a thousand, and they've just given in to just total destruction.
[02:40:50.317 --> 02:40:51.537]  They've got to be removed.
[02:40:52.746 --> 02:40:53.367]  They have to.
[02:40:53.607 --> 02:41:04.533]  And what's brilliant about the time that we're living in, Alex, and you're a part of this, your viewers are a part of this, I mean, people are going to look back in 10 years and see that you were a pioneer in a field of new media.
[02:41:04.633 --> 02:41:05.834]  I mean, it's honestly going to be that.
[02:41:05.854 --> 02:41:07.375]  We are going to break the media.
[02:41:07.835 --> 02:41:09.556]  No one trusts them anymore.
[02:41:09.636 --> 02:41:13.939]  Not the Bernie Sanders, Justice Democrats, not the Tea Party, Conservatives.
[02:41:14.119 --> 02:41:17.941]  And they think if they destroy me, that destroys everyone leaving them.
[02:41:17.981 --> 02:41:18.602]  It does nothing.
[02:41:20.050 --> 02:41:21.391]  It does absolutely nothing.
[02:41:21.451 --> 02:41:22.832]  People are waking up.
[02:41:23.153 --> 02:41:24.114]  Kanye is waking up.
[02:41:24.294 --> 02:41:31.561]  I don't believe in a holographic simulation theory, but I do believe that there is a simulation of sorts, right?
[02:41:31.821 --> 02:41:35.885]  We're told, go to college, saddle a lot of debt, get on some drugs.
[02:41:36.185 --> 02:41:37.847]  That is the fake simulation.
[02:41:38.127 --> 02:41:40.269]  They get us to opt into their false paradigm.
[02:41:40.987 --> 02:41:42.908]  Yeah, and it offers no freedom.
[02:41:43.348 --> 02:41:44.368]  It offers no love.
[02:41:44.648 --> 02:41:46.608]  It offers no redemption or forgiveness.
[02:41:46.829 --> 02:41:49.969]  And that was what really struck me about Hillary Clinton's comments.
[02:41:49.989 --> 02:41:52.650]  And that's when I chose, I would go down with the shit.
[02:41:52.750 --> 02:41:56.811]  I would go down with Donald Trump, even though my friends were saying, this will destroy your career.
[02:41:57.051 --> 02:41:58.552]  I said, I don't give a damn.
[02:41:58.592 --> 02:42:02.773]  She said, before she said that people were deplorable, she said they were irredeemable.
[02:42:02.893 --> 02:42:04.973]  I don't know a single Methodist she claims to be.
[02:42:05.013 --> 02:42:06.034]  She's saying she's a God.
[02:42:06.134 --> 02:42:07.114]  She's saying she's God.
[02:42:07.614 --> 02:42:08.214]  Right, right.
[02:42:08.314 --> 02:42:14.677]  And she has judged us unworthy and I said, I said, no sirree, I'll leave this country if she wins.
[02:42:14.757 --> 02:42:17.598]  And I'm honest, honest to God, I was going to go move to South America.
[02:42:17.638 --> 02:42:20.039]  I told Trump that I might leave if she won because I'd have to.
[02:42:20.059 --> 02:42:22.140]  She's coming out and he said, you're not going to leave.
[02:42:22.540 --> 02:42:23.300]  You're not going to leave.
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:26.661]  He goes, he goes, you're going to have a bigger family, a bigger house.
[02:42:27.082 --> 02:42:31.903]  And in the way he said it, it didn't mean a bigger house, like, like America is a kingdom of liberty.
[02:42:32.063 --> 02:42:33.124]  Our house is getting bigger.
[02:42:33.857 --> 02:42:34.517]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:34.937 --> 02:42:35.758]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:42:35.818 --> 02:42:40.119]  I mean, and the Bible talks about wherever two or more gather in my name, they're all beat.
[02:42:40.279 --> 02:42:42.760]  And you said people don't receive because they ask not.
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:48.001]  And so, we're imposing our willpower against the simulation, and we're all part of that.
[02:42:48.041 --> 02:42:49.182]  Your viewers are a part of that.
[02:42:49.242 --> 02:42:49.962]  It is the Matrix.
[02:42:49.982 --> 02:42:50.682]  You're absolutely right.
[02:42:50.722 --> 02:42:54.504]  They're creating a false cultural bullying Matrix that's a haze.
[02:42:54.744 --> 02:42:55.664]  The real world's right here.
[02:42:55.704 --> 02:42:56.524]  We all love each other.
[02:42:56.784 --> 02:42:57.645]  We're all really here.
[02:42:57.685 --> 02:42:59.645]  We have infinite resources now, like Kanye said.
[02:42:59.985 --> 02:43:00.465]  Next level.
[02:43:00.685 --> 02:43:02.046]  Calls coming up and whistleblowers.
[02:43:02.526 --> 02:43:06.107]  Audience, radio affiliates, TV affiliates, thank you for your support.
[02:43:06.407 --> 02:43:07.708]  But they've cut off the sponsors.
[02:43:07.748 --> 02:43:09.448]  They've blocked us advertising on Google.
[02:43:09.708 --> 02:43:12.109]  They have filed 13 lawsuits.
[02:43:12.149 --> 02:43:13.069]  We've beaten six.
[02:43:13.369 --> 02:43:15.330]  But understand this, I am your soldier.
[02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.751]  You're my soldier.
[02:43:16.791 --> 02:43:17.511]  We're all in this together.
[02:43:18.584 --> 02:43:23.267]  And we're fighting hard for American values, what we know works, and what brings liberty and freedom to our children.
[02:43:23.668 --> 02:43:24.668]  So I salute you and I thank you.

[02:45:26.458 --> 02:45:36.083]  It has a massive effect and you've seen many other reporters that have worked here over the years like David Knight and others they weren't even contest winners but they were runner-uppers.
[02:45:36.423 --> 02:45:53.940]  But even if you don't want to be part of the contest and just want a shot at working here, we're looking for camera people, we're looking for video editors, we're looking for investigative journalists, and we're looking for engineers, we're looking for reporters, we're looking for it all in this major push against the globalists.

[02:45:59.185 --> 02:46:04.331]  But it's critical that as fast as you can, you get your portfolio, your reel, into us.
[02:46:04.391 --> 02:46:07.454]  Whether it be in radio, whether it be in print, whether it be in film.

[02:46:28.272 --> 02:46:29.373]  It's all up to you.
[02:46:29.873 --> 02:46:32.555]  We are expanding in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[02:46:32.895 --> 02:46:34.116]  We are not victims.
[02:46:34.316 --> 02:46:35.537]  We are victorious.
[02:46:35.897 --> 02:46:40.861]  And we are taking it directly to the globalists because we are the resistance.
[02:46:40.941 --> 02:46:45.604]  And we're looking for men and women who are a race, color and creed who love liberty that want to join the fight.
[02:46:46.084 --> 02:46:50.005]  Again, InfoWars.com forward slash contest to find all the rules.
[02:46:50.605 --> 02:46:54.987]  And I'll see you on the front lines of the fight against the NWO.
[02:47:06.310 --> 02:47:08.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:20.735 --> 02:47:25.724]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:47:26.065 --> 02:47:28.369]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.129 --> 02:47:36.331]  Hollywood, the big multinational corporations, and Communist China that now control it, are so nasty.
[02:47:36.351 --> 02:47:40.873]  They want to break America's will so badly that they push too far.
[02:47:41.274 --> 02:47:46.616]  And Trump, and you, and all of us, and Ali Alexander, are all a manifestation of that resistance.
[02:47:46.676 --> 02:47:55.140]  But earlier, Ali was talking about people having a right to stand up and resist by voting, or by political ideas, or even physically if need be.
[02:47:56.405 --> 02:47:59.451]  I thought of the Declaration of Independence, July 4th, 1776.
[02:48:00.614 --> 02:48:02.337]  That's what July 4th is all about.
[02:48:02.357 --> 02:48:06.245]  I know we all know that, but we really consciously
[02:48:07.506 --> 02:48:08.067]  Think about that.
[02:48:08.127 --> 02:48:17.416]  Recently, they were going to have a commencement ball at one of the buildings by Independence Hall, and the principal apologized.
[02:48:17.436 --> 02:48:18.377]  I saw it in the news.
[02:48:18.397 --> 02:48:19.758]  It was a professor, I forget.
[02:48:20.599 --> 02:48:20.979]  The dean.
[02:48:20.999 --> 02:48:22.040]  It was either a college or high school.
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:22.681]  I saw it last week.
[02:48:23.141 --> 02:48:25.624]  He apologized for the ticket saying, party like it's 1776.
[02:48:27.125 --> 02:48:31.926]  And they said, oh, some people are hurt by that because 1776 was about slavery.
[02:48:32.006 --> 02:48:36.388]  No, they almost got rid of it in the first declaration, in the first Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:48:36.948 --> 02:48:39.169]  The West is what got rid of all that.
[02:48:40.229 --> 02:48:40.569]  There it is.
[02:48:40.609 --> 02:48:42.990]  Principal apologizes for party like in 1776.
[02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:45.431]  So it's all about virtue signaling.
[02:48:45.671 --> 02:48:48.531]  But if you actually read what's in this, listen to how revolutionary it is.
[02:48:49.672 --> 02:48:53.093]  The unanimous declaration of 13 United States of America.
[02:48:54.246 --> 02:49:22.088]  And then it goes through, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people dissolve the political bands with which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth a separate equal status station to which the laws of nature and gods entitle them, a decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the cause which impelled them to the separation.
[02:49:23.032 --> 02:49:26.675]  And then it goes through the usurpations, the criminal activity, the behaviors.
[02:49:27.715 --> 02:49:29.677]  Of course, Thomas Jefferson wrote this.
[02:49:30.497 --> 02:49:31.518]  The other guys approved of it.
[02:49:31.958 --> 02:49:37.862]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.
[02:49:38.763 --> 02:49:40.925]  But among them are life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.
[02:49:41.385 --> 02:49:47.010]  That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.
[02:49:47.391 --> 02:50:05.447]  That whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizations and its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness
[02:50:06.813 --> 02:50:07.894]  Is Trump doing that for you folks?
[02:50:08.794 --> 02:50:26.922]  Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[02:50:27.768 --> 02:50:42.544]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same objective, invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security.
[02:50:43.666 --> 02:50:48.830]  Now, Thomas Jefferson grew up on his farm with a bunch of black people.
[02:50:49.290 --> 02:50:53.613]  And then when he became the owner of it, when his dad died, he tried to free them, but there weren't laws to do it.
[02:50:53.953 --> 02:51:00.238]  And he's on record trying to put it in the first declaration, and then the first Bill of Rights, and then the first Constitution that came a decade later.
[02:51:00.558 --> 02:51:02.680]  We didn't really have a government until they had to fight a war.
[02:51:02.720 --> 02:51:04.861]  This was just starting a war, signed under John Hancock.
[02:51:05.942 --> 02:51:16.489]  Hollywood, the media, they all particularly demonize Thomas Jefferson now and say he was a racist because he had sex with the people he ended up freeing and had children with them.
[02:51:17.149 --> 02:51:19.591]  Okay, but he was also hated around the neighborhood for being friendly to blacks.
[02:51:19.871 --> 02:51:24.574]  So the guy that tried to free blacks because he was born into slavery, he's the bad guys.
[02:51:25.891 --> 02:51:32.198]  So, think about the level of that, of the trailblazer, of the idea of it's hard to change.
[02:51:32.218 --> 02:51:33.820]  He says that here, but we've got to do it.
[02:51:34.081 --> 02:51:34.982]  He tried it then.
[02:51:35.002 --> 02:51:45.534]  It took 80 years till his vision happened, and then they take the real symbol of that trailblazing to be the first guy doing it in his time and turn it into something bad, Ali Alexander.
[02:51:47.485 --> 02:51:55.074]  It's really sad, but when I travel this country and I talk to people and they're like, well, you know, I'm not totally convinced.
[02:51:55.115 --> 02:52:00.201]  I said, well, in 20 years, they're going to be asking your children to denounce you while you're still alive.
[02:52:01.138 --> 02:52:03.199]  And that's going to be like Mao's Great Leap.
[02:52:03.559 --> 02:52:07.442]  And people really need to appreciate the school of thought that was going on then.
[02:52:07.702 --> 02:52:11.544]  You had Thomas Hobbes who said that man is inherently bad and might need monarchy.
[02:52:11.844 --> 02:52:16.407]  And you had John Locke that said man is inherently good and we deserve a republic or democracy.
[02:52:16.867 --> 02:52:19.988]  Well, what Thomas Jefferson did is he kind of combined both of them.
[02:52:20.128 --> 02:52:24.308]  He said, the people have a right to self-govern if the monarch is not doing well.
[02:52:24.328 --> 02:52:28.489]  And as you just read, man is probably predisposed to do horrible things.
[02:52:28.969 --> 02:52:36.591]  And our system is really the convergence of the best ideas of both Western and Eastern civilization.
[02:52:37.031 --> 02:52:42.192]  And people don't know, and you kind of alluded to it, we failed the first time with the Articles of Confederation.
[02:52:42.432 --> 02:52:50.758]  Anyone who thinks, oh, well, America will be here all along and media is journalism because they got TVs and notepads, it's not true.
[02:52:51.018 --> 02:52:56.802]  Corporate media is not journalism and we can fail again in America if we're not willing to speak up.
[02:52:57.222 --> 02:52:58.423]  And it's a little embarrassing.
[02:52:58.523 --> 02:53:06.909]  It's a little weird to be talking about Roseanne Barr and Planet of the Apes, but we have to speak truth to power or we don't have the ability to reason anymore.
[02:53:06.949 --> 02:53:10.072]  We lose the best qualities of the Enlightenment and the Renaissance.
[02:53:10.372 --> 02:53:11.933]  And I'm not willing to go down like that.
[02:53:12.503 --> 02:53:15.007]  Well, that's awesome that you're informed on all this, and it's just amazing.
[02:53:15.067 --> 02:53:21.318]  I just don't get how they turn a champion of somebody trying to free the slaves early into the racist.
[02:53:21.378 --> 02:53:21.899]  It's just crazy.
[02:53:21.919 --> 02:53:24.905]  He was born into it, he tried to end it, and then he's the bad guy?
[02:53:25.976 --> 02:53:27.236]  It's Fahrenheit 451.
[02:53:27.436 --> 02:53:29.497]  They've got to demantle all of history.
[02:53:29.697 --> 02:53:36.178]  And then they tell you Benjamin Franklin was the first firefighter and he was burning books, you know, instead of this great author.
[02:53:36.598 --> 02:53:39.159]  And he did establish the first fire department to put out fires.
[02:53:39.219 --> 02:53:43.279]  So it's they're really trying to dismantle all of history so that they can retool it.
[02:53:43.299 --> 02:53:45.820]  And then they can tell us, well, the Democrats have always been good.
[02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:48.340]  And the KKK was a Republican thing.
[02:53:48.540 --> 02:53:50.921]  And, you know, blacks need to take a backseat.
[02:53:51.681 --> 02:53:58.584]  Now to, you know, what they want to do with South America and Mexico and push us all together.
[02:53:58.644 --> 02:54:02.425]  It's economically... Looking into your crystal ball, Ali Alexander, smart guy.
[02:54:02.445 --> 02:54:05.986]  I don't want to be too confident.
[02:54:06.767 --> 02:54:08.907]  Let's look down into some of the more dangerous paths.
[02:54:09.688 --> 02:54:12.689]  I don't want to give many ideas, but I mean, how do you think they could take out Trump?
[02:54:12.749 --> 02:54:14.529]  Staging events, false flags, killing him?
[02:54:14.850 --> 02:54:17.831]  I mean, my God, if they killed him, that would really blow up.
[02:54:17.891 --> 02:54:18.711]  I don't want that to happen.
[02:54:19.605 --> 02:54:24.706]  Well, I'm actually surprised something horrible has not happened yet.
[02:54:25.246 --> 02:54:29.087]  We are in the Trump leg of the Russia hoax.
[02:54:29.368 --> 02:54:30.308]  So that's the good thing.
[02:54:30.348 --> 02:54:33.589]  The good news is that we're about to have a very eventful summer.
[02:54:34.249 --> 02:54:39.170]  People are going to learn more of the realities of what's going on in the DOJ that the media has not told you.
[02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:41.031]  And by the way... I was about to say, you tried to get into whistleblowers.
[02:54:41.071 --> 02:54:41.651]  I apologize.
[02:54:41.691 --> 02:54:42.071]  Get into that.
[02:54:43.214 --> 02:54:49.642]  No, but what I think is that it's too late to take out Trump, but they want to disable him.
[02:54:49.682 --> 02:54:52.245]  And so they're putting people around him who will lie to him.
[02:54:53.086 --> 02:54:56.130]  They're telling him that he doesn't have this authority or that authority.
[02:54:56.390 --> 02:54:59.174]  Unfortunately, Mitch McConnell is cooperating with a lot of this.
[02:54:59.574 --> 02:55:01.336]  And so they're really trying to disable him.
[02:55:01.376 --> 02:55:06.881]  But if we can get past November and we can maintain the House and the Senate, it's Trump's show after that.
[02:55:07.161 --> 02:55:09.123]  And I promise no one's seen nothing yet.
[02:55:09.443 --> 02:55:12.686]  I mean, it will look like a renaissance in America that we have not.
[02:55:12.746 --> 02:55:12.947]  It will.
[02:55:13.187 --> 02:55:16.150]  It will probably trump, no pun intended, the Great Awakening.
[02:55:17.486 --> 02:55:19.327]  Well, my friend, you're on fire, and you're right.
[02:55:19.467 --> 02:55:21.847]  It is the patriots in our government and outside.
[02:55:21.867 --> 02:55:32.531]  It's all about saying no to the intimidation, the bullying, and the way you joined Trump right in the middle of the firestorm when they were, you know, the entire cover of National Review was saying you can't go with him.
[02:55:32.551 --> 02:55:34.892]  Anybody that signs on will be blackballed forever.
[02:55:35.192 --> 02:55:38.973]  Well, now National Review is carrying Trump's water more and more.
[02:55:39.053 --> 02:55:39.953]  So, I agree.
[02:55:39.993 --> 02:55:41.914]  I think Trump so far is now one.
[02:55:43.055 --> 02:55:50.203]  Yeah, it's absolutely true.
[02:55:50.263 --> 02:55:59.133]  And really, I would like for people to say a prayer for some of these rank-and-file career FBI agents and then lawyers inside the DOJ.
[02:55:59.474 --> 02:56:01.196]  People don't understand that when
[02:56:02.245 --> 02:56:04.927]  Some of these thugs started targeting Trump's family.
[02:56:04.947 --> 02:56:08.569]  He was fine taking these metaphorical bullets.
[02:56:08.789 --> 02:56:20.255]  But when they started saying, we're going to lock up Jared Kushner and his children are going to grow up without a dad, we're going to lock up Don Jr., Trump Christmas Eve, what I'm told, went ballistic.
[02:56:20.735 --> 02:56:25.277]  And he decided then that he was going to fight fire with fire as much as he could.
[02:56:25.777 --> 02:56:29.218]  And thanks to him, you know, and David Nunes, we got the memo.
[02:56:29.538 --> 02:56:36.941]  And what I heard after the memo was that we had additional people go to the IG, so the Inspector General, and start whistleblowing.
[02:56:36.961 --> 02:56:37.801]  So think about it.
[02:56:38.302 --> 02:56:40.282]  The press is supposed to protect whistleblowers.
[02:56:40.542 --> 02:56:42.463]  The Senate is supposed to protect whistleblowers.
[02:56:42.743 --> 02:56:44.524]  And these people were so intimidated.
[02:56:44.984 --> 02:56:52.451]  By the culture of corruption that Comey created, and the actual corruption that McCabe was creating, that they didn't want to speak up.
[02:56:52.491 --> 02:56:53.752]  They thought there was no champion.
[02:56:53.792 --> 02:56:57.175]  Well, Trump said, I'll be a champion, I'll protect my family, and I'll protect yours.
[02:56:57.215 --> 02:56:57.595]  That's right.
[02:56:57.655 --> 02:57:00.878]  He took the gloves off, and just like every other tyrant, overreaches.
[02:57:00.918 --> 02:57:01.619]  They've done it again.
[02:57:01.639 --> 02:57:03.481]  Ali Alexander, very impressed.
[02:57:03.521 --> 02:57:04.021]  Love your work.
[02:57:04.061 --> 02:57:04.842]  Please join us again soon.
[02:57:05.711 --> 02:57:05.951]  I will.

[02:57:35.996 --> 02:57:37.097]  It's that simple.
[02:57:37.117 --> 02:57:39.297]  I mean, look at the headlines here in mainstream news.
[02:57:39.817 --> 02:57:42.478]  The war against Alex Jones, the legal war against Alex Jones.
[02:57:42.498 --> 02:57:43.758]  This is the New York Times.
[02:57:43.898 --> 02:57:46.739]  I mean, they say, bring down Jones, everything else falls.
[02:57:47.159 --> 02:57:48.380]  It's that serious.
[02:57:48.740 --> 02:57:49.260]  We'll be back.
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:49.760]  Stay with us.
[02:58:01.966 --> 02:58:14.217]  You know we're doing world-changing things here, and I decided, because we did this last year, I was looking back at the calendar a few weeks ago, and I noticed that last Memorial Day we did some of the biggest specials of the year, so we're doing it right now.
[02:58:14.577 --> 02:58:17.740]  A huge raft of specials, great products, chance for you to try them out.
[02:58:17.760 --> 02:58:19.661]  Memorial Day Patriot Special.

[02:58:29.926 --> 02:58:33.347]  There are formulas that aren't even as good that retail for $60.
[02:58:33.747 --> 02:58:37.728]  You cannot get, from my research, a better nootropic or a price anywhere near this.

[02:59:15.557 --> 02:59:16.137]  Horrify Soros.
[02:59:16.198 --> 02:59:20.120]  Stand in the gap against the forces of eugenics and mass murder, planetary death.
[02:59:44.096 --> 02:59:44.456]  That's it.
[02:59:45.017 --> 02:59:46.538]  This is planetary death we're fighting.
[02:59:46.739 --> 02:59:49.461]  Find our operation and we will rampage forward.
[02:59:56.788 --> 03:00:00.671]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:12.558 --> 03:00:15.519]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:18.661]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.202 --> 03:00:23.823]  Here is what the enemy fears.
[03:00:24.103 --> 03:00:28.765]  Here is what, in the dark of the night, when they wake up scared, they're thinking about.
[03:00:28.785 --> 03:00:30.206]  They're thinking about your energy.
[03:00:30.226 --> 03:00:31.427]  They're thinking about your will.
[03:00:31.447 --> 03:00:32.987]  They're thinking about your strength.
[03:00:33.007 --> 03:00:35.669]  They're thinking about your fighting spirit.
[03:00:36.869 --> 03:00:40.451]  America has always been a nation of fighters who never give up.
[03:00:41.587 --> 03:00:41.827]  Right?
[03:00:42.187 --> 03:00:42.907]  We never give up.
[03:00:43.107 --> 03:00:43.367]  Ever.
[03:00:43.567 --> 03:00:43.848]  Right?
[03:00:45.588 --> 03:00:46.268]  Never give up.
[03:00:46.488 --> 03:00:50.109]  We're fighters like the amazing patients and families here today.
[03:00:50.369 --> 03:01:08.433]  Now, as I proudly sign, and this is very personal for me, but as I proudly sign this bill, thousands of terminally ill Americans will finally have the help, the hope, and the fighting chance, and I think it's going to be better than chance,
[03:01:09.773 --> 03:01:24.285]  That they will be cured, that they will be helped, that they'll be able to be with their families for a long time, or maybe just for a longer time.
[03:01:27.407 --> 03:01:31.350]  You know, he said earlier in the speech, he said, this is very personal to me to get these cures in.
[03:01:31.751 --> 03:01:33.032]  Melania has not been seen in 17, 18 days.
[03:01:35.541 --> 03:01:37.642]  And they said, oh, it's not malignant, they're kidneys.
[03:01:38.723 --> 03:01:44.607]  And I thought about something, because I know a lot of Eastern European folks who grew up in that area, and I went, wait a minute.
[03:01:45.587 --> 03:01:57.775]  And I looked at the gas plume, and when Melania was like about 12 years old or so, Chernobyl went right over her.
[03:01:59.456 --> 03:02:04.539]  And I know men and women that are from that area of the world, and every person I know
[03:02:05.965 --> 03:02:07.786]  Has had tumors.
[03:02:09.427 --> 03:02:11.048]  I know a woman that looks just like Melania.
[03:02:11.068 --> 03:02:13.409]  And she's had tumors.
[03:02:14.109 --> 03:02:14.830]  Three of them removed.
[03:02:18.331 --> 03:02:20.633]  The joke is, you know, she's all like, I glow in the dark.
[03:02:23.874 --> 03:02:24.455]  Think about that.
[03:02:24.515 --> 03:02:26.536]  I'm not saying she's got something worse, but...
[03:02:27.594 --> 03:02:29.975]  Trump, for the first time ever, got a little tear in his eye.
[03:02:30.595 --> 03:02:33.075]  He said it's very personal for me and he, you know.
[03:02:34.016 --> 03:02:36.436]  With Trump, it's serious.
[03:02:37.177 --> 03:02:39.397]  Silence on Melania Stokes' conspiracy theories.
[03:02:41.658 --> 03:02:42.358]  What is it?
[03:02:42.398 --> 03:02:43.178]  I saw it two days ago.
[03:02:43.198 --> 03:02:43.918]  It was 17 days?
[03:02:43.958 --> 03:02:45.019]  So it's like 19 days now?
[03:02:46.399 --> 03:02:47.239]  That doesn't sound good.
[03:02:48.960 --> 03:02:52.721]  And God knows, they make fun of him eating McDonald's three times a day.
[03:02:53.041 --> 03:02:56.742]  He has trusted people that go to different McDonald's and get his food because
[03:02:59.462 --> 03:03:01.123]  You think he can trust the food he's given?
[03:03:04.666 --> 03:03:06.448]  You're trying to level the war we're in right now.
[03:03:11.412 --> 03:03:12.693]  And I'm not going to get off into it.
[03:03:16.836 --> 03:03:20.259]  But 18 years ago, I went and spoke at a public event.
[03:03:21.680 --> 03:03:28.286]  And I had feds trying to come up and say, hey, you want to plant, which now 20 days, well, they're saying, hey, you want to plant bombs?
[03:03:29.833 --> 03:03:30.514]  No, no, no.
[03:03:48.775 --> 03:03:58.220]  So, you read about the kings in every culture, you know, those old Roman emperors, the Japanese emperors, the Chinese emperors, the African emperors, everybody got poisoned?
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:03:59.381]  They had food tasters?
[03:04:00.021 --> 03:04:01.282]  You think they're trying to poison Trump?
[03:04:01.902 --> 03:04:03.423]  You think they aren't jacking with Melania?
[03:04:03.443 --> 03:04:06.345]  You think these people just dumped coffee on top of our heads?
[03:04:06.845 --> 03:04:13.889]  They're out to get everybody, and I'm not bitching about it, but I want everybody to recognize Roger Stone, and I talked to people that were involved, he didn't make this up,
[03:04:15.504 --> 03:04:18.566]  I made him show me the stuff before they came to the gag order, and I knew they'd do it.
[03:04:19.446 --> 03:04:20.847]  Had the Fed show up.
[03:04:21.347 --> 03:04:22.448]  He got shot last year.
[03:04:22.468 --> 03:04:23.249]  He didn't even know what it was.
[03:04:23.269 --> 03:04:24.429]  He goes, yeah, it slammed on my back.
[03:04:25.290 --> 03:04:26.470]  He goes, but I can't find anything in me.
[03:04:27.211 --> 03:04:33.034]  He got sick two days later from radiation poisoning, but it didn't go all the way in through his, it went through the shirt and deflected on his skin.
[03:04:34.175 --> 03:04:34.735]  Polonium.
[03:04:35.916 --> 03:04:39.078]  So they go, oh look, they killed the Russian agent with polonium, but it deflected.
[03:04:40.038 --> 03:04:42.600]  Roger Age, I'd be honest, about 10 years after that.
[03:04:43.629 --> 03:04:48.570]  But they hit him with polonium and then they T-boned him a few months later because they were going to blame him all along as the final guy.
[03:04:48.590 --> 03:04:50.471]  He predicted that and now they've honed in.
[03:04:50.491 --> 03:04:52.632]  He's the final guy they want to set up.
[03:04:53.432 --> 03:04:53.972]  Think about that.
[03:04:54.932 --> 03:04:58.333]  They shoot you with polonium, say that's how Russians kill you, and then set you up.
[03:04:58.393 --> 03:05:00.994]  I'm telling you, they're trying to kill Roger right now.

[03:06:21.602 --> 03:06:27.968]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:28.608 --> 03:06:29.809]  Let's play some of this.
[03:06:29.829 --> 03:06:30.830]  I got a point I want to make.
[03:06:31.371 --> 03:06:32.732]  The late, great David Bowie.
[03:06:50.160 --> 03:06:50.960]  Shut your mouth.
[03:06:51.761 --> 03:06:53.641]  I'll give you television.
[03:06:54.521 --> 03:06:56.482]  I'll give you eyes of blue.
[03:06:57.562 --> 03:07:01.664]  I'll give you a system to rule the world.
[03:07:02.144 --> 03:07:04.084]  Visions of swastikas.
[03:07:20.382 --> 03:07:21.203]  Oh, you gotta ban this song.
[03:07:21.223 --> 03:07:22.704]  It talks about visions of swastikas.
[03:07:22.984 --> 03:07:24.786]  David Bowie's worshipping Nazis.
[03:07:24.846 --> 03:07:25.286]  No, he's not.
[03:07:27.608 --> 03:07:28.770]  I'll give you television.
[03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:29.911]  I'll give you Eyes of Blue.
[03:07:30.991 --> 03:07:37.657]  My little child, girl, you shouldn't mess with me.
[03:07:37.978 --> 03:07:40.940]  I'll ruin everything you own.
[03:07:41.261 --> 03:07:44.483]  We'll go to Rogerstown in a minute.
[03:07:45.024 --> 03:07:45.765]  You know what?
[03:07:45.785 --> 03:07:47.306]  I'll give you television.
[03:07:56.124 --> 03:07:59.807]  I'll give you a man that wants to rule the world.
[03:07:59.847 --> 03:08:00.948]  Great song by David Bowie.
[03:08:01.788 --> 03:08:03.390]  They would ban that probably on the air today.
[03:08:03.410 --> 03:08:06.312]  He says, that's visions of swastikas in my mind.
[03:08:08.473 --> 03:08:09.514]  Shut your mouth.
[03:08:10.215 --> 03:08:11.696]  So, that's what it comes down to.
[03:08:11.756 --> 03:08:12.716]  Roger's taking over here.
[03:08:14.077 --> 03:08:22.644]  But Roger really ought to get into, I guess it was last January, because I was getting married.
[03:08:24.372 --> 03:08:28.834]  And Trump had literally just called my wife that day.
[03:08:30.635 --> 03:08:31.916]  And then at like 5 a.m.
[03:08:31.936 --> 03:08:33.577]  the next day, my phone starts ringing.
[03:08:37.279 --> 03:08:41.821]  And Roger is throwing up everywhere and he's been to the hospital and he's got polonium in his blood.
[03:08:42.882 --> 03:08:44.763]  And the feds show up and say don't talk about it.
[03:08:45.876 --> 03:08:52.037]  And the media goes, oh, even though the Fed showed up and grabbed the hospital records and told them not to talk, Roger claims it.
[03:08:52.157 --> 03:08:57.959]  Oh, Roger claims he's going to be the final guy they set up for Russiagate, that they want him dead so he can't testify to Congress.
[03:08:58.239 --> 03:09:00.179]  And now he's the final guy.
[03:09:00.199 --> 03:09:04.380]  He's the guy they admit they're circling in on.
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:06.300]  And it gets even better.
[03:09:08.201 --> 03:09:09.021]  It gets even better.
[03:09:10.472 --> 03:09:12.893]  They're now questioning army officers and others.
[03:09:12.993 --> 03:09:13.713]  Thirteen people.
[03:09:14.133 --> 03:09:18.214]  And they go, no Alex, it's centering in on you, and that you're a mastermind too.
[03:09:18.454 --> 03:09:19.294]  Talk about insane.
[03:09:19.514 --> 03:09:23.875]  Yeah, I'm a mastermind when it comes to love and freedom, and thinking you're going to want freedom over tyranny.
[03:09:25.256 --> 03:09:27.096]  But there's no masterminding crap.
[03:09:27.176 --> 03:09:27.836]  I believe in you.
[03:09:27.896 --> 03:09:30.937]  We put the idea out, we throw the stone in the pond, it comes back.
[03:09:30.957 --> 03:09:32.718]  I'm a mastermind.
[03:09:32.758 --> 03:09:34.158]  I know when it's really still weather and
[03:09:34.980 --> 03:09:38.781]  You know, it's in the spring, and if I go put some stink bait on the end of a line and throw it out at 5 a.m.
[03:09:38.801 --> 03:09:42.222]  in the morning, by the time I'm done drinking my coffee, I might catch that 20-pound catfish.
[03:09:42.502 --> 03:09:43.183]  I did it this weekend.
[03:09:43.703 --> 03:09:44.863]  I guess I am a mastermind.
[03:09:45.443 --> 03:09:47.864]  I know that I don't go hunting the first week if it isn't freezing.
[03:09:48.364 --> 03:09:50.165]  You know, everybody else is out trying to shoot a big buck.
[03:09:50.845 --> 03:09:58.831]  I go out and look where the big buck comes through and I'm going to wait until it has that first big cold snap and I'm going to get out there at 3am so when it gets light at 6am I'm going to shoot that sucker.
[03:09:59.411 --> 03:10:00.472]  I guess I am a mastermind.
[03:10:00.752 --> 03:10:05.535]  But it didn't mean the Russians told me, like, oh, we'll drain the swamp, we'll lock Hillary up, Hillary for prison.
[03:10:05.956 --> 03:10:07.457]  Oh, Putin gave me that idea.
[03:10:07.537 --> 03:10:09.438]  But we're now in the season.
[03:10:09.919 --> 03:10:11.400]  This really freaked Roger's wife out.
[03:10:12.349 --> 03:10:15.533]  Then she had some issues with the hospital, I'm not saying I did it, but I said it because it's true.
[03:10:15.953 --> 03:10:18.516]  We're in the season where they want to kill Roger Stone and kill me.
[03:10:18.536 --> 03:10:20.138]  I don't say that for drama.
[03:10:20.338 --> 03:10:20.839]  My God!
[03:10:20.859 --> 03:10:30.330]  20, 30 articles a day, New York Times, Rolling Stone, shut Alex Jones, the war on Alex Jones, the legal war on Alex Jones, all this crap, all these lies they print.
[03:10:30.690 --> 03:10:32.993]  They're not doing this to ever win these lawsuits.
[03:10:35.049 --> 03:10:45.457]  They are winding up their hit teams, so when they kill me, they go, oh, that's that son of a bitch that was mean to the Sandy Hook families and all this made-up stuff.
[03:10:46.958 --> 03:10:51.842]  So I don't say all this to protect us in the main for our own individual selves.
[03:10:51.982 --> 03:10:57.247]  I say it so that they don't twist the narrative if we get killed about what and who we were.
[03:10:58.029 --> 03:11:00.650]  Because we're men, and we're not going to turn on the President.
[03:11:00.911 --> 03:11:02.771]  We're not going to make things up against the President.
[03:11:03.132 --> 03:11:05.913]  It's not going to happen, and that's not even the story with all that stuff.
[03:11:05.973 --> 03:11:12.196]  It's this, the Alex Jones presidency, the New York Times, and, you know, the war on Alex Jones, the New Republic, it's here.
[03:11:13.757 --> 03:11:24.183]  So, this is where they're going, and now that they're failing in their rage, they want the low-hanging fruit that is Roger Stone, Alex Jones.
[03:11:24.243 --> 03:11:26.224]  But as the Wall Street Journal said three months ago,
[03:11:27.452 --> 03:11:29.173]  Now, you know, merging with Disney.
[03:11:30.214 --> 03:11:46.425]  They said, we're going to get WikiLeaks, we're going to get Alex Jones, we're going to mix ISIS in, and once we've got them, the left the next day had hundreds of articles, oh, the end of Alex Jones, oh, hold on to your tinfoil hat, YouTube's about to ban Alex Jones, and it began a month later.
[03:11:47.166 --> 03:11:53.210]  And only Drudge sat there and showed we were being censored and showed the real video of what we said so they wouldn't even be defamed.
[03:11:56.049 --> 03:12:15.677]  But I read this thing, the legal war on Alex Jones, out of the New Republican, it's all these lies I didn't say, it's not even quotes, and it links to it, just to defame me, hoping some crazy person, see they accuse me of trying to send crazy people to harass different groups out there, they make that up, but they are trying to send crazy people to kill us!
[03:12:18.018 --> 03:12:22.240]  And they think I'm like them, they think that it's going to make me back down or go away, it's not!
[03:12:24.172 --> 03:12:31.758]  But you make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we need you to flood InfoWarsTore.com with orders, and it's a great product for you anyways.
[03:12:31.778 --> 03:12:34.680]  We have free shipping on all the top sellers right now, and 50% off at Rainforest.
[03:12:34.700 --> 03:12:40.324]  We need you to go to Roger Stone's Legal Defense Fund and give him $5, or go buy his book at InfoWarsTore.com, Stone's Rules.
[03:12:40.624 --> 03:12:46.649]  You're already awake, you're like, hey, we already get this, but we need you to continue to take action, but even more importantly, we need you
[03:12:47.802 --> 03:12:49.704]  If they do kill us, because I'm not worried about that.
[03:12:50.144 --> 03:12:50.865]  I have responsibility.
[03:12:50.885 --> 03:12:51.565]  I'm not suicidal.
[03:12:51.605 --> 03:12:52.086]  I love life.
[03:12:52.106 --> 03:12:57.610]  But at the same time, there's this thing when you're a man, you get to a certain point where you've already done so much stuff that responsibility is a big weight.
[03:12:58.111 --> 03:13:00.933]  And you want to live a long time, but at the same time, you're not scared of dying.
[03:13:02.174 --> 03:13:03.835]  It's real empowerment.
[03:13:03.875 --> 03:13:06.918]  You just want to take care of your family after you're gone.
[03:13:07.278 --> 03:13:07.999]  And you also
[03:13:10.345 --> 03:13:11.926]  Wish you could keep fighting, you know what I mean?
[03:13:12.026 --> 03:13:14.628]  But you're not going to let them have the victory if they kill you.
[03:13:14.648 --> 03:13:21.292]  But see, I studied secret assassinations just in my research, and one of the main things the CIA and other groups do is they have gelatin darts.
[03:13:22.913 --> 03:13:25.755]  And they can put any poison they want in them, and then they shoot you with a gelatin dart.
[03:13:25.775 --> 03:13:28.977]  It's going to shoot you up close, and then it dissolves into your body.
[03:13:29.317 --> 03:13:32.019]  It just looks like background stuff, so it doesn't pick up.
[03:13:32.639 --> 03:13:34.380]  So it pierces you, but then it dissolves.
[03:13:35.021 --> 03:13:36.562]  They also have ice bullets and things.
[03:13:36.582 --> 03:13:38.123]  You've got to shoot somebody up closer with that.
[03:13:39.123 --> 03:13:45.624]  And so, Roger, just spend a few minutes on whatever topics you've got to take over here, because the woods are lovely, dark, and deep, my friend.
[03:13:45.664 --> 03:13:48.085]  I want to stay on with you, but I've got miles to go before I sleep.
[03:13:48.125 --> 03:13:48.965]  I know you do, too, as well.
[03:13:49.005 --> 03:13:53.546]  But talk about the day you're out there with your nephew and get shot in the back, because you didn't even understand.
[03:13:53.566 --> 03:13:58.527]  You said it hit you, you were bleeding, then you got sick the next day, vomiting, hospital, polonium poisoning.
[03:13:59.047 --> 03:14:00.408]  But thank God it didn't go all the way in.
[03:14:00.468 --> 03:14:01.528]  It deflected on the surface.
[03:14:01.568 --> 03:14:03.288]  Maybe you got 20% of the dose.
[03:14:03.728 --> 03:14:05.609]  Probably took some years off your life, but you survived.
[03:14:05.629 --> 03:14:06.629]  So tell folks what that was like.
[03:14:08.035 --> 03:14:15.900]  Well, Alex, I know the liberals like to make light of this, but... Oh, you're just the number one target and everything else, but oh yeah, but you got shot in the back, yeah.
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:37.494]  Yeah, you know, back around the time that I was writing the manuscript for The Making of the President 2016, which outlines the extraordinarily important role that InfoWars and other alternative media outlets played in the improbable election of Donald Trump, I clearly got exceedingly ill.
[03:14:38.607 --> 03:14:41.771]  I believe that I was hit by some kind of projectile.
[03:14:41.791 --> 03:14:45.316]  This is not just, you know, an overnight... You described it.
[03:14:45.697 --> 03:14:47.539]  It slapped into your shirt, put a hole in the shirt.
[03:14:47.579 --> 03:14:47.980]  What happened?
[03:14:49.080 --> 03:14:54.383]  Well, I had, within days, I had lesions on my chest and on my face, night sweats.
[03:14:54.403 --> 03:14:56.264]  Yeah, but we're going to go to break.
[03:14:56.364 --> 03:14:57.564]  Tell me what you told me when it happened.
[03:14:57.845 --> 03:15:01.026]  Describing how it slapped you in the back, the bleeding, what happened?
[03:15:01.086 --> 03:15:02.927]  You didn't know what the hell it was?
[03:15:03.007 --> 03:15:06.869]  I felt this like, almost like a bug bite in my back, all of a sudden sharp.
[03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:09.710]  And then there's nothing really there.
[03:15:09.750 --> 03:15:14.333]  And I thought, well, maybe I was bit by a mosquito or a spider or something.
[03:15:14.373 --> 03:15:16.694]  And of course, immediately I got ill.
[03:15:17.133 --> 03:15:19.476]  Look, there is no question right now.
[03:15:20.697 --> 03:15:30.969]  Big, big story in Washington, all over Washington, about the fact that I have been called now to testify for the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[03:15:31.609 --> 03:15:33.091]  This is actually not news.
[03:15:33.151 --> 03:15:34.613]  This is old news.
[03:15:35.467 --> 03:15:38.428]  I relish the opportunity to testify.
[03:15:38.908 --> 03:15:40.848]  I want to testify.
[03:15:41.449 --> 03:15:44.589]  Alex, I want to testify in public.
[03:15:45.290 --> 03:15:46.230]  What are they hiding?
[03:15:46.710 --> 03:15:47.070]  Stay there.
[03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:48.511]  You're taking over on the other side.
[03:15:48.591 --> 03:15:53.932]  Roger Stone, if you're not watching on television, is wearing an amazing blue-on-blue suit right now.
[03:15:53.992 --> 03:15:55.773]  I'm very jealous of the style right now.
[03:15:55.793 --> 03:15:56.173]  I'm serious.
[03:15:56.213 --> 03:15:57.333]  That is slick.
[03:15:57.373 --> 03:16:00.314]  I mean, I'm not gay or anything, but he looks very handsome right now.
[03:16:00.634 --> 03:16:00.994]  We'll be back.
[03:16:03.493 --> 03:16:03.973]  Come on, innit?
[03:16:04.153 --> 03:16:05.594]  You're not gonna do it one-on-one, lad.
[03:16:05.614 --> 03:16:06.854]  You're not gonna do it one-on-one.
[03:16:07.454 --> 03:16:16.117]  You're not gonna do it one-on-one.
[03:16:16.217 --> 03:16:27.921]  You're not- You're not gonna do it one-on-one.
[03:16:28.081 --> 03:16:31.862]  One-on-one, you do it one-on-one!
[03:16:39.272 --> 03:16:58.685]  Imagine a whole gang of thugs training with communist Islamicists at a mosque, learn from one of their operatives that Tommy Robinson is at a McDonald's with his camera lady, and then they come over and attack the woman to get the camera, viciously start beating her, she fights back, he fights back, then they run as cowardly scum, and the police are all there and do nothing.
[03:16:58.805 --> 03:17:03.628]  All the way through this, I knew at certain points, with Lucy and with George as well, who are the camera team of us,
[03:17:04.681 --> 03:17:08.892]  I knew we'd get attacked at certain times, but I never thought they'd go for Lucy.
[03:17:09.574 --> 03:17:11.399]  I guess I thought too highly of them.
[03:17:12.401 --> 03:17:13.422]  I thought they had models.
[03:17:13.762 --> 03:17:22.007]  So I always said, and as soon as they turned up and I saw the mask, I was basically getting out of the car, I looked across, I see seven men coming towards me with masks.
[03:17:22.667 --> 03:17:25.049]  And then I stood and I tried to move away from Lucy.
[03:17:25.409 --> 03:17:26.550]  I thought they'd all go for me.
[03:17:27.130 --> 03:17:29.611]  So I thought, that's sound, I'll move away, they'll all come for me.
[03:17:30.052 --> 03:17:30.552]  They didn't.
[03:17:30.992 --> 03:17:32.033]  They sectioned off.
[03:17:32.073 --> 03:17:33.854]  One went to George and one went to Lucy.
[03:17:34.314 --> 03:17:36.376]  And then, as you can see, he starts attacking Lucy.
[03:17:36.416 --> 03:17:37.456]  He's wrestling on the floor with her.
[03:17:37.796 --> 03:17:38.497]  But to be honest,
[03:17:39.077 --> 03:17:40.438]  Lucy gave as good as she got.
[03:17:41.018 --> 03:17:43.219]  Lucy gave as good as she got.
[03:17:43.239 --> 03:17:44.959]  And he ended up, she was kicking him and hitting him.
[03:17:45.219 --> 03:17:50.101]  And even at the end, I looked over and even see George, the other camera lad as well, scuffling with them as well.
[03:17:50.301 --> 03:17:52.302]  But they were masked up.
[03:17:52.582 --> 03:17:53.743]  They were ready to attack us.
[03:17:54.363 --> 03:17:58.224]  And as you're right, straight after this, the police have turned up.
[03:17:58.804 --> 03:17:59.505]  They've done nothing.
[03:17:59.765 --> 03:18:01.846]  No one's even spoke about poor Lucy, really.
[03:18:02.206 --> 03:18:03.006]  No one spoke about her.
[03:18:03.760 --> 03:18:04.821]  I haven't seen one journalist.
[03:18:04.861 --> 03:18:06.002]  No one's contacted her.
[03:18:06.202 --> 03:18:07.603]  No media have contacted her.
[03:18:07.903 --> 03:18:10.105]  She's violently attacked for being a journalist.
[03:18:10.686 --> 03:18:11.647]  They're journalists.
[03:18:11.967 --> 03:18:17.651]  But yet every single report from the mainstream media, Tommy Robinson fighting with masked men.
[03:18:18.172 --> 03:18:19.953]  No, that's not how it was.
[03:18:20.514 --> 03:18:26.318]  Tommy Robinson was getting a burger from McDonald's and his camera girl and his cameraman were violently attacked.
[03:18:26.499 --> 03:18:31.503]  Well, we've known it's this bad for some time now and me and my friends often say that
[03:18:32.083 --> 03:18:41.393]  The day that Richard Spencer got punched was the day when the bar was set very, very low because we saw how many people celebrated it afterwards, how many people fetishized it.
[03:18:41.713 --> 03:18:44.276]  We saw the memes coming out saying, punch a Nazi.
[03:18:44.296 --> 03:18:46.018]  It's okay to punch a Nazi.
[03:18:46.578 --> 03:18:48.180]  And of course, you know, who's a Nazi?
[03:18:48.220 --> 03:18:49.241]  Well, we decide that.
[03:18:49.301 --> 03:18:52.024]  So we've realized that it's going to be violent for some time.
[03:18:52.644 --> 03:18:56.888]  The most shocking thing, actually, the most upsetting thing was how many people are saying it's fake or it's staged.
[03:18:56.988 --> 03:19:02.714]  People seem to think that Tommy has hired these people to come and attack us, which if he had, I think I might have to have a little word with him.
[03:19:03.595 --> 03:19:11.983]  But it's funny, quite a lot of people probably like to call themselves feminists and like to say that they stand up for women's rights, and yet here's a video of a woman on the floor
[03:19:12.783 --> 03:19:17.505]  And, oh, it's fake, it's staged, or even better, I've seen some people say that I deserved it, which is very nice.
[03:19:17.525 --> 03:19:25.367]  Some of my friends who are quite normal, who have normal parents, who think that everything's fine and the media don't lie, they saw that clip and it actually did make them realise how bad it is.
[03:19:25.427 --> 03:19:27.908]  So, in a way, you have to be able to show that.
[03:19:28.448 --> 03:19:47.318]  The extremes for people to wake up and realize actually yes this is what this is what's happening on the streets this is what's happening it's not being reported and it is being celebrated because I'm in this world I know what to expect we all do we all know what happens I've seen Tommy get in trouble before it's just what happens but I mean there is a part of me that does feel sad when I realize that actually
[03:19:47.718 --> 03:19:50.160]  No, no single media outlet has got in touch with me.
[03:19:50.180 --> 03:19:52.302]  I've had maybe one friend get in touch with me.
[03:19:52.723 --> 03:19:55.085]  This is sort of something that's just going to get brushed under the rug.
[03:19:55.165 --> 03:19:59.328]  I mean, this is classic authoritarian nightmare dystopia we're talking about.
[03:20:06.755 --> 03:20:09.417]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.888 --> 03:20:20.773]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:20:21.093 --> 03:20:21.694]  Watch me!
[03:20:22.955 --> 03:20:23.576]  Watch me!
[03:20:24.957 --> 03:20:25.478]  I got it!
[03:20:26.779 --> 03:20:27.440]  Watch me!
[03:20:28.761 --> 03:20:29.282]  I got it!
[03:20:29.642 --> 03:20:29.902]  Hey!
[03:20:30.423 --> 03:20:31.484]  I got something!
[03:20:31.664 --> 03:20:33.766]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[03:20:33.786 --> 03:20:34.107]  Woo!
[03:20:34.447 --> 03:20:34.767]  I know!
[03:20:35.208 --> 03:20:38.391]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[03:20:38.631 --> 03:20:39.032]  I get ya!
[03:20:40.885 --> 03:20:42.546]  I'm super bad.
[03:20:42.566 --> 03:20:43.767]  I know, I feel it too, my friend.
[03:20:44.168 --> 03:20:45.028]  Woo!
[03:20:46.169 --> 03:20:47.230]  Whole energy.
[03:20:47.290 --> 03:20:50.352]  I just can't help it sometimes.
[03:20:50.372 --> 03:20:51.093]  I gotta move.
[03:20:51.133 --> 03:20:53.575]  It tells me what to do.
[03:20:53.795 --> 03:20:54.776]  I gotta move.
[03:20:55.456 --> 03:20:56.717]  It tells me what to do.
[03:20:56.817 --> 03:20:57.938]  I wanna try myself.
[03:21:11.397 --> 03:21:12.497]  And I'm super bad!
[03:21:13.818 --> 03:21:15.778]  The immortal James Brown bringing us in.
[03:21:15.818 --> 03:21:17.619]  All right, Roger, you're taking over.
[03:21:17.739 --> 03:21:19.259]  You've been called to the Senate committee.
[03:21:19.299 --> 03:21:19.980]  You knew it was coming.
[03:21:20.380 --> 03:21:21.780]  They ignore all your statements on it.
[03:21:21.820 --> 03:21:24.001]  And then when it happens, they go, oh, look, Roger's in trouble.
[03:21:24.241 --> 03:21:25.501]  Ooh, he's called before him.
[03:21:25.842 --> 03:21:26.702]  So all this is happening.
[03:21:26.722 --> 03:21:30.103]  You're going to be in studio next week hosting at least two days of the broadcast.
[03:21:31.021 --> 03:21:37.365]  They're making me get out of the combat operation because I've gotten to the point where I'm literally working 18 hours a day even from home.
[03:21:37.725 --> 03:21:38.346]  I can't stop.
[03:21:38.406 --> 03:21:39.386]  I can't do anything but work now.
[03:21:39.406 --> 03:21:41.928]  So I'm going to have to cool my engine for at least a week.
[03:21:42.448 --> 03:21:43.789]  And so I'm going to try my best.
[03:21:45.010 --> 03:21:49.793]  Take my babies sunbathing and fishing, but I'll still be doing broadcast from the road.
[03:21:50.353 --> 03:21:50.914]  Just briefly,
[03:21:52.096 --> 03:21:53.437]  Listeners, it's the epic future.
[03:21:53.517 --> 03:21:53.897]  It's here.
[03:21:53.957 --> 03:21:54.337]  It's real.
[03:21:54.357 --> 03:21:59.881]  People send me emails and make donations now and they go, I thought you were kidding that Soros and Hillary were suing you.
[03:21:59.901 --> 03:22:02.722]  It's like the Democrats' number one mission is to destroy you.
[03:22:03.082 --> 03:22:04.323]  I actually read the Wall Street Journal.
[03:22:04.343 --> 03:22:05.704]  I actually read the New Republic.
[03:22:06.705 --> 03:22:07.865]  Why do they think you're so powerful?
[03:22:08.005 --> 03:22:08.526]  I'm not.
[03:22:09.586 --> 03:22:14.509]  They want to set the precedent with me to then destroy everybody else.
[03:22:14.569 --> 03:22:15.290]  They've set it.
[03:22:16.030 --> 03:22:17.351]  So, voila.
[03:22:18.427 --> 03:22:19.988]  The biggest thing we need is money.
[03:22:20.628 --> 03:22:23.229]  They're censoring us, they're blocking us, they're banning us from advertising.
[03:22:23.589 --> 03:22:27.470]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, but it's not about that.
[03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:39.975]  If you just knew how good the products are, if you just knew that nobody else puts as much product in here for the price that we do, everybody else does marketing, and then it's marked up seven times on average.
[03:22:40.908 --> 03:22:45.690]  Ours is 150% off retail, but we're always discounting.
[03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:46.991]  So, it's normally 100%.
[03:22:47.471 --> 03:22:51.073]  Right now, we got stuff at 50% markup.
[03:22:51.193 --> 03:22:52.293]  Some of it's lower.
[03:22:52.353 --> 03:22:53.234]  Let me explain what that means.
[03:22:54.134 --> 03:22:58.456]  You get some of these products on sale right now, and you do auto-ship, so 10% off.
[03:22:58.957 --> 03:23:01.158]  Some of them are breaking even.
[03:23:01.718 --> 03:23:02.778]  Nobody does that.
[03:23:02.878 --> 03:23:07.841]  But, I want to say, I've got the best nutraceuticals at the best prices at the lowest prices.
[03:23:08.121 --> 03:23:10.062]  When you buy it at retail, which they never are at,
[03:23:11.391 --> 03:23:12.491]  We're always 25% off.
[03:23:14.072 --> 03:23:15.232]  This is my own weird philosophy.
[03:23:15.252 --> 03:23:16.172]  I didn't take marketing.
[03:23:16.232 --> 03:23:17.793]  I just, I do what I want to do.
[03:23:18.273 --> 03:23:19.453]  I know you want to see it's discounted.
[03:23:19.493 --> 03:23:22.574]  So, I already have a super low price.
[03:23:22.594 --> 03:23:22.954]  150% markup.
[03:23:23.094 --> 03:23:24.095]  Average is seven times markup.
[03:23:24.595 --> 03:23:27.936]  And then I cut it down, 25% off.
[03:23:28.416 --> 03:23:30.857]  So, of the total price, it's like 100% markup.
[03:23:31.097 --> 03:23:32.577]  Then when I discount, it's off that.
[03:23:33.257 --> 03:23:35.718]  Right now, folks, some of these are right at cost.
[03:23:36.809 --> 03:23:37.570]  Try Brain Force.
[03:23:37.650 --> 03:23:39.452]  Try the Real Red Pill Plus now with energy.
[03:23:39.512 --> 03:23:40.394]  Try these products.
[03:23:40.454 --> 03:23:41.355]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:23:41.375 --> 03:23:45.140]  But no, you can't lose because you're funding the information war.
[03:23:46.357 --> 03:23:47.178]  It's quite an epic battle.
[03:23:47.218 --> 03:23:48.639]  Quite frankly, my life is not boring.
[03:23:48.699 --> 03:23:49.700]  It's very, very exciting.
[03:23:50.220 --> 03:23:51.201]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:23:51.241 --> 03:23:52.202]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:23:52.242 --> 03:23:55.885]  Read the thousands of reviews per item because it's incredible.
[03:23:56.165 --> 03:24:01.669]  But get some t-shirts while you're at it so you can experience what it's like to meet the Patriots, but also to see the enemy first on.
[03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:02.810]  Wear the uniform.
[03:24:03.370 --> 03:24:04.051]  Wear your colors.
[03:24:04.091 --> 03:24:04.852]  Fly your flag.
[03:24:04.892 --> 03:24:05.312]  Go out.
[03:24:05.712 --> 03:24:07.394]  You go in a red state area, get your dinner bought.
[03:24:07.434 --> 03:24:09.796]  Might meet your next wife or your husband or your boyfriend.
[03:24:10.882 --> 03:24:14.584]  But, you wear it in the deep blue area, you will be attacked.
[03:24:15.365 --> 03:24:16.446]  So prepare yourself.
[03:24:16.966 --> 03:24:17.827]  Choose your own adventure.
[03:24:18.147 --> 03:24:22.710]  All right, Stone, you got a lot to cover, my friend, but I want to finish up with you in this segment that you take over.
[03:24:23.490 --> 03:24:25.432]  You're coming in here a few days next week to be hosting.
[03:24:25.732 --> 03:24:27.993]  Owen Schroeder's doing a great job as well, the rest of the crew.
[03:24:28.354 --> 03:24:29.314]  Paul will be back from vacation.
[03:24:29.334 --> 03:24:30.315]  Everybody's like, where's Paul?
[03:24:30.755 --> 03:24:33.517]  You know, he's with Tommy Robinson, you know, he's going down here.
[03:24:34.057 --> 03:24:37.019]  Paul's got the same disease, working 18 hours a day, so he had to take off a week.
[03:24:37.099 --> 03:24:38.100]  So happened to be when this was happening.
[03:24:38.861 --> 03:24:40.302]  The epicness of you, though,
[03:24:41.322 --> 03:24:42.263]  Yeah, I really have Alex.
[03:24:42.283 --> 03:24:43.945]  It gets more bizarre by the moment.
[03:25:07.250 --> 03:25:15.136]  Months ago, I agreed to testify for the House and the, pardon me, for the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees.
[03:25:16.016 --> 03:25:21.641]  They have given us a document request that is so onerous, so broad.
[03:25:22.341 --> 03:25:29.506]  I am not exaggerating when I tell you that it will fill three tractor trailers full of paper, but that's what they want.
[03:25:30.247 --> 03:25:31.868]  And that is what they shall have.
[03:25:32.728 --> 03:25:34.349]  There's no smoking guns in there.
[03:25:34.369 --> 03:25:38.371]  If they're looking for the smoking gun, it doesn't exist.
[03:25:38.792 --> 03:25:41.813]  Because there is no Russian collusion.
[03:25:42.374 --> 03:25:47.797]  But as you'll recall, when I testified for the House Committee, I wanted to testify in public.
[03:25:48.317 --> 03:25:50.078]  Let the people see everything.
[03:25:50.198 --> 03:25:51.339]  I have nothing to hide.
[03:25:51.759 --> 03:25:54.921]  But no, they wanted me to testify behind closed doors.
[03:25:55.021 --> 03:25:57.022]  So they could then leak twisted BS?
[03:25:58.023 --> 03:25:58.223]  Right.
[03:25:58.283 --> 03:25:59.324]  Then when I did,
[03:26:00.134 --> 03:26:01.255]  Well, what happens then?
[03:26:01.675 --> 03:26:09.980]  But Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell and the other demagogues in the House Democratic Caucus say, well, why didn't Stone testify in public?
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:11.361]  He's perjured himself.
[03:26:11.421 --> 03:26:19.245]  Well, if people would be allowed to hear me speak, they would see graphically that I testified fully, completely, and honestly.
[03:26:19.585 --> 03:26:21.967]  This is the Washington charade.
[03:26:22.467 --> 03:26:40.903]  So, I am more than happy to testify for the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, but I want to thank my friends at CNN who go out of their way to find the very worst photographs of me that they can possibly find.
[03:26:41.364 --> 03:26:45.027]  It is so obvious and annoying.
[03:26:45.587 --> 03:26:46.128]  There you go.
[03:26:46.960 --> 03:26:47.861]  Perfect example.
[03:26:47.881 --> 03:26:49.623]  It doesn't even look like you.
[03:26:49.643 --> 03:26:50.544]  It kind of looks like me.
[03:26:50.764 --> 03:26:54.929]  I look like... I'm far more handsome than that.
[03:26:55.029 --> 03:26:55.850]  I guarantee you.
[03:26:56.311 --> 03:27:02.397]  So, look, I hope that they will listen to my request to testify in public.
[03:27:02.998 --> 03:27:06.202]  It will be an extraordinary democratic experience.
[03:27:07.192 --> 03:27:21.997]  And I'm calling on my supporters, once we nail down the date in June, if you're a supporter of Donald Trump, if you're a supporter of Roger Stone, if you're a supporter of InfoWars, if you're a supporter of Alex Jones, come to Washington.
[03:27:22.377 --> 03:27:24.317]  I want to see you in Washington.
[03:27:25.338 --> 03:27:26.898]  In numbers, there is strength.
[03:27:27.638 --> 03:27:30.059]  I have nothing whatsoever to hide.
[03:27:30.686 --> 03:27:36.409]  I do get kind of tired of answering the same question over and over and over again.
[03:27:36.429 --> 03:27:37.390]  That's my next question.
[03:27:38.451 --> 03:27:39.371]  Where is this going?
[03:27:39.831 --> 03:27:42.573]  Our listeners are just sick of Russiagate, but now it's coming to a head, so it's important.
[03:27:42.593 --> 03:27:43.394]  That's why I'm covering it.
[03:27:43.914 --> 03:27:52.039]  There's nothing there, and now to learn from all these witnesses we've talked to on and off air, they're like, tell us how Jones and Stone did this, and tell us how they run the whole thing.
[03:27:52.539 --> 03:27:55.341]  And it's like, I want to build myself up, don't get me wrong.
[03:27:56.241 --> 03:27:57.302]  This is cuckoo land.
[03:27:57.322 --> 03:27:58.923]  They don't understand we have shared beliefs.
[03:27:59.303 --> 03:28:01.324]  They don't get we have audiences that are Americana.
[03:28:01.564 --> 03:28:04.486]  They really think we're all, like, their average leftist slave.
[03:28:06.147 --> 03:28:10.829]  Oh, and they ask questions like, how often do Jones and Stone talk on the phone?
[03:28:11.570 --> 03:28:12.871]  Do they talk on Signal?
[03:28:12.911 --> 03:28:14.071]  Do they talk on WhatsApp?
[03:28:14.952 --> 03:28:17.233]  Is Stone writing Jones' material?
[03:28:17.753 --> 03:28:19.834]  Alex, nobody writes your material.
[03:28:19.855 --> 03:28:20.535]  Somebody should be.
[03:28:22.436 --> 03:28:24.397]  You know, what do they like to drink?
[03:28:24.937 --> 03:28:25.898]  What do they like to eat?
[03:28:26.496 --> 03:28:27.617]  Where do they hang out?
[03:28:28.218 --> 03:28:29.739]  How often do you think they talk?
[03:28:30.380 --> 03:28:33.363]  I mean, these are unconstitutional questions.
[03:28:33.403 --> 03:28:37.907]  Maybe they're unfamiliar with the free assembly aspects of the Constitution.
[03:28:38.428 --> 03:28:38.748]  Anyway.
[03:28:39.383 --> 03:28:40.724]  We're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:40.844 --> 03:28:41.644]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:28:41.704 --> 03:28:42.625]  That's Alex Jones.
[03:28:42.785 --> 03:28:44.626]  And we will be right back.
[03:28:44.906 --> 03:28:45.226]  That's right.
[03:28:45.266 --> 03:28:45.807]  He'll take over.
[03:28:45.847 --> 03:28:47.888]  What they don't get is it's all on air.
[03:28:48.648 --> 03:28:49.569]  There's no secrets.
[03:28:50.589 --> 03:28:51.590]  There's no secrets.
[03:28:51.630 --> 03:28:53.111]  Like, we love America.
[03:28:53.171 --> 03:28:54.011]  We love free market.
[03:28:54.051 --> 03:28:55.132]  We're kicking your ass.
[03:28:55.612 --> 03:28:56.373]  See how that works.
[03:28:56.413 --> 03:28:57.433]  The country's coming back.
[03:28:57.914 --> 03:29:00.035]  We're just... Stay with us.
[03:29:02.765 --> 03:29:09.034]  President Trump gave a speech on Friday at the Naval Academy for their commencement and said, America is back.
[03:29:09.715 --> 03:29:18.488]  Hollywood does not have the megaphone anymore, but patriots that believe in real Americana are back in charge, and the world is taking notice.
[03:29:19.429 --> 03:29:33.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, to celebrate Memorial Day and the great sacrifices of our veterans, we are offering free shipping at InfoWarsTore.com and 50% off on more than 20 best-selling items like Brain Force, the amazing nootropic.
[03:29:33.454 --> 03:29:42.617]  Help support the information war, get great products at the same time, and continue to fund an operation that is a thorn in the side of the globalists and is continuing to back President Trump
[03:29:43.197 --> 03:29:44.317]  How come Hollywood embraces
[03:30:08.172 --> 03:30:11.534]  This madman, this director, who raped a 13-year-old.
[03:30:12.155 --> 03:30:13.496]  He didn't rape a 13-year-old.
[03:30:13.516 --> 03:30:14.636]  It was statutory rape.
[03:30:14.756 --> 03:30:15.497]  Yeah, all right.
[03:30:15.557 --> 03:30:17.858]  Well... It's not statutory rape.
[03:30:17.878 --> 03:30:19.980]  You know, he had sex with a minor.
[03:30:20.300 --> 03:30:20.560]  All right?
[03:30:20.600 --> 03:30:22.141]  That's not rape, you know?
[03:30:22.301 --> 03:30:24.323]  He was guilty of having sex with a minor.
[03:30:24.663 --> 03:30:25.804]  That she didn't want to have.
[03:30:25.924 --> 03:30:27.385]  No, that was not the case at all.
[03:30:27.465 --> 03:30:28.525]  She wanted to have it.
[03:30:28.625 --> 03:30:31.807]  Well, in the transcripts... Dated the guy.
[03:30:32.148 --> 03:30:33.028]  Dated the guy.
[03:30:33.048 --> 03:30:33.528]  She was 13.
[03:30:34.849 --> 03:30:38.190]  And found out William by the way, we're talking about America's morals.
[03:30:38.210 --> 03:30:46.313]  We're not talking about the morals in Europe and everything all right wait a second China with a 13 year old girl, and you're in a grown man.
[03:30:46.733 --> 03:30:48.854]  You know that that's wrong Look
[03:30:53.516 --> 03:30:56.177]  You know, that's a damn good question.
[03:30:56.237 --> 03:30:58.597]  The only thing I can come up with is because of power.
[03:31:15.586 --> 03:31:19.467]  You know, money and power within the industry.
[03:31:19.847 --> 03:31:29.869]  It's just the same thing that Weinstein was accused of, telling women they'd be blackballed, they'd never work again if they didn't submit to his commands.
[03:31:30.889 --> 03:31:36.371]  And basically, in my opinion, that's the same strength of the same position.
[03:31:40.349 --> 03:31:49.074]  When you look at Roman Polanski, what he's been able to get away with because, again, of his recognition of his position.
[03:31:49.474 --> 03:32:05.764]  These people, all of them, regardless of who they are, they become so full of themselves and self-importance and power within the industry that they basically feel they're above the law, they're above reproach, and they can get away with any damn thing they feel like.
[03:32:06.384 --> 03:32:15.892]  And when you listen to some of the idiotic things that he has said, not just now, but all through his career ever since, he became well-known.
[03:32:16.952 --> 03:32:18.834]  And to me, that's really too bad.
[03:32:18.874 --> 03:32:23.397]  Hey, I'm an actor, but I'm no different than anybody else.
[03:32:23.438 --> 03:32:24.819]  That's what I do for a living.
[03:32:24.879 --> 03:32:30.303]  That doesn't make me, you know, above anybody else in any other way.
[03:32:31.864 --> 03:32:33.826]  It's just what you do for a living.
[03:32:35.015 --> 03:32:36.196]  You have a job.
[03:32:37.017 --> 03:32:39.780]  You have what you do for a living and you're good at it.
[03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:48.187]  But that doesn't set you up against the rest of the world and make you any better of a person than anybody else.
[03:32:48.207 --> 03:32:52.732]  And people that take that attitude and think they are, they're sick.
[03:32:53.853 --> 03:32:55.194]  They have a real problem.
[03:32:55.274 --> 03:32:56.935]  They need to come back down to earth.
[03:32:57.015 --> 03:32:58.417]  Somebody needs to put them there.
[03:33:05.777 --> 03:33:12.019]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.503 --> 03:33:24.024]  News.
[03:33:24.564 --> 03:33:25.384]  Analysis.
[03:33:25.904 --> 03:33:26.565]  Reports.
[03:33:27.305 --> 03:33:29.506]  It's The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:30.006 --> 03:33:32.807]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:33:36.403 --> 03:33:37.044]  Welcome back.
[03:33:37.684 --> 03:33:40.267]  We're on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:40.347 --> 03:33:49.015]  And as I indicated, the big news out of Washington, a glaring headline on the Daily Beast, U.S.
[03:33:49.035 --> 03:33:52.839]  Senate Intelligence Committee wants to grill Roger Stone.
[03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:57.123]  No, Roger Stone wants to grill the U.S.
[03:33:57.143 --> 03:33:58.905]  Senate Intelligence Committee.
[03:33:59.690 --> 03:34:01.591]  This really grows tedious.
[03:34:01.771 --> 03:34:14.678]  I don't know how many times I have to answer the same questions about Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 and John Podesta's emails and so on.
[03:34:14.818 --> 03:34:16.099]  I've answered these questions
[03:34:16.719 --> 03:34:22.221]  Ad nauseum, there is no evidence whatsoever of wrongdoing.
[03:34:22.641 --> 03:34:35.826]  Just to be absolutely clear, I had no advance notice of the content source or the exact disclosure deadline for the WikiLeaks disclosures regarding the DNC.
[03:34:36.687 --> 03:34:45.110]  And I had no advance notice of the publication of John Podesta's extraordinarily embarrassing emails.
[03:34:45.854 --> 03:34:56.560]  We recognize that this entire controversy is designed to distract from the content of those completely authentic disclosures.
[03:34:57.621 --> 03:35:07.166]  And then, more recently, Randy Credico, a former friend of mine, goes on MSNBC two nights ago and says,
[03:35:07.782 --> 03:35:18.345]  Julian Assange is willing to be questioned by the House Democratic investigators under the direction of Congressman Adam Schiff.
[03:35:19.446 --> 03:35:29.168]  Immediately, Congressman Schiff says the only way he'd be willing to question or interrogate Mr. Assange is if he's in U.S.
[03:35:29.228 --> 03:35:37.531]  custody, which is somewhat troubling because there are no known federal charges pending against Mr. Assange.
[03:35:38.348 --> 03:35:43.371]  Unless, of course, Mr. Schiff knows something that we don't know.
[03:35:43.971 --> 03:35:52.076]  And then, Wikileaks comes forward and says Credico was never authorized to make such an offer.
[03:35:52.756 --> 03:35:56.758]  This is a second lie that Mr. Credico has been caught in.
[03:35:57.399 --> 03:36:00.700]  The whole thing grows extraordinarily tedious.
[03:36:01.421 --> 03:36:03.142]  There is no Russian collusion.
[03:36:03.882 --> 03:36:06.884]  I received nothing whatsoever from the
[03:36:07.668 --> 03:36:08.469]  I don't know.
[03:36:28.149 --> 03:36:30.511]  Because they are the ones who are guilty.
[03:36:30.872 --> 03:36:43.983]  Because they used a fabricated dossier as the underlying legal rationale for unconstitutional spying on the Republican candidate for president.
[03:36:44.544 --> 03:36:54.433]  And, as we now know, and was first revealed here on InfoWars, the FBI infiltrated Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
[03:36:55.580 --> 03:37:04.747]  Now the Washington Post and the New York Times would have us believe that they did so to search for evidence of Russian collusion.
[03:37:05.187 --> 03:37:05.467]  No.
[03:37:06.148 --> 03:37:17.856]  They did so to plant faux evidence of Russian collusion as part of what Peter Strzok called in his text messages, their insurance policy.
[03:37:18.797 --> 03:37:23.480]  This is the greatest constitutional crisis in American history.
[03:37:24.255 --> 03:37:40.258]  And the idea that Rod Rosenstein, the acting Attorney General, the de facto Attorney General, refuses to turn over to Congress the documents that outline where Mr. Mueller's authority comes from.
[03:37:41.127 --> 03:37:54.614]  The fact that he refuses to turn over to the Congress the details of the FISA warrants that were leveled on multiple members of the Trump campaign, well, that is sedition.
[03:37:55.635 --> 03:37:56.835]  You see, a U.S.
[03:37:57.135 --> 03:38:09.322]  citizen can only be subject to a FISA warrant if they are actively involved in espionage on behalf of a foreign power against the United States.
[03:38:10.498 --> 03:38:16.524]  This entire scandal makes Watergate look like, well, a second-rate burglary.
[03:38:17.224 --> 03:38:19.526]  You see, the difference is quite clear.
[03:38:20.167 --> 03:38:35.221]  In the case of Watergate, Nixon went down because he got caught having his campaign people spy on the opposition, and because his campaign people infiltrated the campaign of his opponents.
[03:38:35.871 --> 03:38:38.913]  But they at least use private individuals.
[03:38:39.433 --> 03:38:53.701]  In this case, the Obama administration used the awesome power and the authority and the capability of the federal government to spy on the Republican candidate for president.
[03:38:55.122 --> 03:39:00.465]  How long will it be before the president's patients are exhausted?
[03:39:01.665 --> 03:39:04.707]  I am one who thinks there's been a great improvement
[03:39:05.174 --> 03:39:13.596]  In the President's response to all of this since he got himself a wartime conciliary in Rudy Giuliani.
[03:39:14.536 --> 03:39:27.678]  Rudy Giuliani rusty is better than his previous lawyers because Giuliani has very effectively characterized the Mueller inquiry as a partisan witch hunt.
[03:39:28.518 --> 03:39:32.459]  And we are in a situation where a terrific paper
[03:39:33.086 --> 03:39:45.852]  By Professor Stephen Calabresi yesterday of Northwestern University outlines the unconstitutional underpinnings of Mueller's very appointment.
[03:39:46.952 --> 03:39:59.538]  So if I am right, and if having come up empty handed with no evidence of Russian collusion, no evidence of WikiLeaks hijinks,
[03:40:00.305 --> 03:40:15.676]  And Robert Mueller seeks to frame me for some concocted offense in an attempt to leverage my testimony against the president, as Politico has predicted.
[03:40:16.316 --> 03:40:20.620]  Let me say right now, John Dean, I am not.
[03:40:21.680 --> 03:40:24.502]  I will never betray this president.
[03:40:25.463 --> 03:40:28.225]  I will never roll on this president.
[03:40:29.071 --> 03:40:34.956]  I will never backstab this president, unlike so many others in Washington.
[03:40:36.157 --> 03:40:43.084]  But they're counting on the fact that I don't have the money to fight this federal legal juggernaut.
[03:40:43.804 --> 03:40:49.429]  That's why I must appeal to you to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:40:49.850 --> 03:40:54.294]  StoneDefenseFund.com and make a generous contribution.
[03:40:54.972 --> 03:41:05.478]  Now Alex Jones and I are working together to put together a joint InfoWars legal defense fund because he is facing the same kind of challenges.
[03:41:06.198 --> 03:41:07.439]  Make no mistake about it.
[03:41:07.819 --> 03:41:12.822]  This Sandy Hook lawsuit is designed to destroy Alex Jones.
[03:41:13.102 --> 03:41:15.023]  To take him off the air.
[03:41:15.344 --> 03:41:17.625]  To shut InfoWars down.
[03:41:17.985 --> 03:41:19.946]  To take us off of YouTube.
[03:41:20.386 --> 03:41:21.567]  Off of Facebook.
[03:41:22.007 --> 03:41:23.088]  Off of Twitter.
[03:41:23.786 --> 03:41:24.886]  Off of Yahoo!
[03:41:25.627 --> 03:41:30.748]  It is nothing less than an effort to snuff out our First Amendment rights.
[03:41:31.228 --> 03:41:35.390]  It's part and parcel of the same exact strategy.
[03:41:36.510 --> 03:41:50.795]  They have hit me with frivolous harassment lawsuits by the Democratic National Committee, by employees of the DNC, where I'm being sued not for a hate speech,
[03:41:51.610 --> 03:42:00.377]  Not for defamatory speech, not for false speech, but for constitutionally protected free speech.
[03:42:01.338 --> 03:42:03.380]  They want to gag Alex Jones.
[03:42:03.780 --> 03:42:06.062]  They want to gag InfoWars.
[03:42:06.402 --> 03:42:08.524]  They want to gag Roger Stone.
[03:42:09.004 --> 03:42:13.928]  They don't want us to talk about Robert Mueller's record as a federal prosecutor.
[03:42:14.328 --> 03:42:20.033]  They don't want us to talk about the egregious corruption of the Clinton crime family.
[03:42:20.761 --> 03:42:23.854]  No, this is all designed to shut us down.
[03:42:24.497 --> 03:42:29.380]  So therefore, right now, go to the InfoWars.com store this very instant.
[03:42:29.840 --> 03:42:32.802]  Find the button where you can make a donation.
[03:42:33.162 --> 03:42:39.987]  If you're not in the market for any of our great pharmaceuticals, you can find the button to make a generous contribution.
[03:42:40.007 --> 03:42:39.987]  $50, $100, $200, $500.
[03:42:40.407 --> 03:42:42.208]  Yes, some InfoWarriors have even sent us $1,000.
[03:42:42.248 --> 03:42:43.329]  It would be a godsend.
[03:42:43.349 --> 03:42:43.709]  We need it.
[03:42:53.995 --> 03:42:59.177]  Not going for fancy salaries and plush offices and big expense accounts.
[03:42:59.657 --> 03:43:03.598]  It's going to fight the war for the- Now!
[03:43:05.598 --> 03:43:06.979]  They think you're a goldfish!
[03:43:08.579 --> 03:43:10.760]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[03:43:10.940 --> 03:43:11.980]  I believe in you!
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:13.561]  I don't think you're stupid!
[03:43:17.152 --> 03:43:18.213]  Emirates of London!
[03:43:18.533 --> 03:43:20.154]  Old genitals were cut off!
[03:43:20.394 --> 03:43:22.836]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[03:43:22.976 --> 03:43:24.176]  And we're not backing down, ever!
[03:43:25.397 --> 03:43:27.238]  I wanna get these people!
[03:43:27.298 --> 03:43:27.799]  We're winning!
[03:43:27.859 --> 03:43:28.959]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[03:43:29.099 --> 03:43:29.560]  Can't you?
[03:43:29.580 --> 03:43:31.481]  We have broken their back!
[03:43:31.861 --> 03:43:32.802]  Yes, I can feel it!
[03:43:32.822 --> 03:43:35.343]  Let's go!
[03:43:35.663 --> 03:43:37.064]  Come on!
[03:43:37.124 --> 03:43:38.745]  Come on!
[03:43:38.805 --> 03:43:39.326]  Come on!

[03:43:43.228 --> 03:43:43.628]  Come on!
[03:43:48.866 --> 03:43:50.467]  Vengeance is coming!
[03:43:51.167 --> 03:43:52.788]  Fire is coming!
[03:43:53.268 --> 03:43:57.050]  The real revolution against you is coming!
[03:43:57.230 --> 03:43:59.291]  And you will burn in hell!

[03:46:52.645 --> 03:46:53.605]  Planetary death.
[03:46:54.146 --> 03:46:54.506]  That's it.
[03:46:55.046 --> 03:46:56.566]  This is planetary death we're fighting.
[03:46:56.786 --> 03:46:59.507]  Find our operation and we will rampage forward.
[03:47:06.788 --> 03:47:09.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.150 --> 03:47:20.712]  My fellow Americans, let me make this perfectly clear.
[03:47:21.372 --> 03:47:28.776]  You're listening to Roger Stone on InfoWars.
[03:47:29.316 --> 03:47:31.517]  Thank you very much, Mr. President.
[03:47:31.817 --> 03:47:40.682]  If you're reading the news, President Richard Nixon's home, Western White House in San Clemente, now on the market for $6.3 million.
[03:47:40.702 --> 03:47:41.282]  I only wish.
[03:47:45.692 --> 03:47:59.638]  I read an extraordinary article in the Intercept called Bread to Suffer about the extraordinary medical experiments that are being conducted on man's best friend.
[03:48:00.038 --> 03:48:12.784]  That's right, dogs and cats who are being subject to some of the most brutal torture, the most bizarre quasi-medical experiments that you can possibly imagine.
[03:48:13.698 --> 03:48:26.482]  Owen Schroyer and I at the War Room have been in the forefront working with the very good people at White Coat Labs Project to stop this inhumane treatment of man's best friend.
[03:48:26.962 --> 03:48:36.244]  But this story absolutely blew my mind to find out that the federal government abused over 60,000 dogs last year and over 820,000 individual
[03:48:42.256 --> 03:48:43.457]  Innocent animals.
[03:48:44.297 --> 03:48:47.639]  The kind of experiments we're talking about are nauseating.
[03:48:48.160 --> 03:48:58.026]  Having holes drilled in their heads to be filled with drugs, subjecting them to crystal meth.
[03:49:00.399 --> 03:49:14.206]  Subjecting them to toxic fumes, removing their eyes, removing their vocal cords, and then, of course, refusing to let anybody adopt these animals.
[03:49:14.706 --> 03:49:16.227]  This is a disgrace.
[03:49:16.987 --> 03:49:18.368]  The White House telephone number, 202-456-1414.
[03:49:18.388 --> 03:49:19.908]  Let's put it up here.
[03:49:19.928 --> 03:49:19.968]  202-456-1414.
[03:49:29.062 --> 03:49:30.883]  4-5-6-1-4-1-4.
[03:49:31.883 --> 03:49:44.487]  Please call the White House now and ask them to stop the inhumane, bizarre treatment of man's best friend and the experiments on dogs by the federal government.
[03:49:44.987 --> 03:49:50.929]  These experiments have no scientific value whatsoever and they must stop.
[03:49:52.128 --> 03:50:08.795]  One thing I was remiss about yesterday was to mention how proud I was to see President Trump talk about our American veterans and those who have given their lives in their service of their country.
[03:50:09.675 --> 03:50:18.059]  One individual stands out who is still with us and must be acknowledged as a true American hero.
[03:50:19.076 --> 03:50:33.196]  My old boss, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, 91 years old, recently received the Congressional Medal of Honor, a true American patriot.
[03:50:33.843 --> 03:50:46.048]  When the Bush family turned tail and abandoned Donald Trump, 91-year-old Bob Dole was storming, barnstorming through the Midwest, lining up votes for the Republican ticket.
[03:50:46.548 --> 03:50:48.469]  God bless you, Senator Dole.
[03:50:48.789 --> 03:50:51.470]  You are a true American hero.
[03:50:53.891 --> 03:51:00.594]  Now, I want to remind you again that the expanded programming here, whether it's the War Room,
[03:51:01.955 --> 03:51:05.838]  With my colleague Owen Schroyer, which comes on shortly.
[03:51:06.378 --> 03:51:12.381]  Or whether it's the iconic Alex Jones Show, midday, every day, where history is made.
[03:51:13.081 --> 03:51:17.264]  Or whether it's David Knight's terrific program, Real News in the Morning.
[03:51:18.004 --> 03:51:26.769]  And so much more that we have planned is only possible through your loyal patronage at TheInfoWars.com store.
[03:51:27.581 --> 03:51:31.884]  And I have kind of a selfish recommendation for you.
[03:51:32.504 --> 03:51:38.128]  This is the very best place for you to buy a copy of my new book, Stone's Rules.
[03:51:38.828 --> 03:51:54.538]  Now, if you buy Stone's Rules at the Infowars.com store and you send your copy to me at your expense, I will gladly autograph it and send it back to you at my expense.
[03:51:55.307 --> 03:52:00.393]  That's right, you can get an autographed copy of the book that I am most proud.
[03:52:01.054 --> 03:52:04.458]  This is a book that is my rules of the road.
[03:52:04.718 --> 03:52:12.968]  This is my book of maxims and guidelines that can be used by any men or women who want to get ahead in life.
[03:52:14.013 --> 03:52:25.197]  Whether it is business, or politics, or media, or fashion, or agriculture, or any avocation, this book is for you.
[03:52:25.217 --> 03:52:31.880]  It's not ideological, it's not philosophical, although you will certainly see my politics.
[03:52:32.440 --> 03:52:34.961]  This is a book that is about success.
[03:52:35.974 --> 03:52:41.898]  Manners, style, food, fashion, automobiles, you name it.
[03:52:42.398 --> 03:52:43.759]  It's a book you must have.
[03:52:44.200 --> 03:52:56.628]  Now, I had this book made in a particularly heavy stock because, frankly, I'm hoping that people will mark it up, they'll dog ear it, they'll go back and look at it again and again for solid advice.
[03:52:57.148 --> 03:53:02.932]  Get your copy of Stone's Rules at the Infowars store now at the very best price.
[03:53:03.372 --> 03:53:05.574]  And it'll be my great honor to sign it.
[03:53:05.976 --> 03:53:07.077]  And send it back to you.
[03:53:07.677 --> 03:53:09.618]  Thank you so very much.
[03:53:09.718 --> 03:53:11.679]  There is a limited availability.
[03:53:12.660 --> 03:53:19.704]  So please go to the Infowars.com store now and order your copy of Stone's Rules.
[03:53:24.347 --> 03:53:29.870]  There's a little question that I am going to be called before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[03:53:30.430 --> 03:53:35.013]  What they don't seem to understand is that I relish this opportunity.
[03:53:35.717 --> 03:53:37.758]  That I want to testify.
[03:53:38.519 --> 03:53:42.822]  I'd also like to testify in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[03:53:43.582 --> 03:53:45.624]  But I don't see what there is to hide.
[03:53:45.764 --> 03:53:54.510]  Why can't we have these proceedings in open like the Watergate hearings or the Army McCarthy hearings of the 1950s?
[03:53:55.070 --> 03:53:57.252]  What are they trying to hide?
[03:53:58.012 --> 03:54:03.276]  I'd like to take on frontally the entire question of Russian collusion.
[03:54:04.119 --> 03:54:14.125]  I'd like to destroy the myths about Alex Jones and Roger Stone and how we are plotting with Vladimir Putin to win the election.
[03:54:14.606 --> 03:54:16.727]  Because this is nonsense.
[03:54:17.428 --> 03:54:22.231]  Of course, I'm guessing, they will want me to testify behind closed doors.
[03:54:22.711 --> 03:54:28.895]  That way, the Democrats can come out of the meeting and leak things you didn't say.
[03:54:30.595 --> 03:54:35.576]  Put words in your mouth, cast aspersions on your remarks.
[03:54:36.316 --> 03:54:45.339]  I've seen this graphically in the House Committee hearings, where members of the minority said that Stone didn't answer certain questions.
[03:54:45.439 --> 03:54:51.300]  No, I answered every single question, honestly and truthfully.
[03:54:52.321 --> 03:54:57.522]  So as soon as we know a June date, and it appears that it will be in June,
[03:54:58.277 --> 03:55:11.804]  Because the documents that the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested will fill three trailer trucks full of paper, and they need some time to digest that material.
[03:55:12.524 --> 03:55:18.887]  I will be more than happy to come to Washington and lay it all out for the American people.
[03:55:19.507 --> 03:55:24.390]  In fact, I'm already beginning to think about what I'm going to wear.
[03:55:25.493 --> 03:55:35.258]  I really hope that this opportunity comes to pass and that the Senate, in its wisdom, will allow this hearing to be in public.
[03:55:36.518 --> 03:55:42.681]  In the meantime, one more time, remember that we face the greatest fight in Infowars history.
[03:55:43.202 --> 03:55:49.525]  There is an insidious globalist plot run by the tech left that intends to shut us down.
[03:55:50.485 --> 03:55:53.967]  When I take the buy link from Amazon or
[03:55:54.443 --> 03:56:01.425]  Info Wars or Barnes and Noble, and I seek to put it into a paid Facebook promotion.
[03:56:01.825 --> 03:56:03.346]  Well, my ad is rejected.
[03:56:04.266 --> 03:56:05.206]  How could that be?
[03:56:05.607 --> 03:56:08.307]  There's no inappropriate content in my book.
[03:56:08.908 --> 03:56:13.549]  No, this is an insidious effort to kneecap anyone on the right.
[03:56:14.149 --> 03:56:15.710]  They're doing it to Alex Jones.
[03:56:16.110 --> 03:56:17.550]  They're doing it to Owen Schroer.
[03:56:17.891 --> 03:56:19.231]  They're doing it to David Knight.
[03:56:19.878 --> 03:56:21.439]  They're doing it to Roger Stone.
[03:56:21.839 --> 03:56:23.180]  They're doing it to Millie Weaver.
[03:56:23.500 --> 03:56:27.502]  They're doing it to the entire crew here at InfoWars.
[03:56:28.062 --> 03:56:29.803]  Don't let them get away with it, folks.
[03:56:29.964 --> 03:56:31.264]  Here's what you can do.
[03:56:31.905 --> 03:56:42.290]  When you see a story at InfoWars that you really like, one that rings your bell, one you think is interesting, take that link and send it out to others.
[03:56:42.911 --> 03:56:45.192]  And send it again and again and again.
[03:56:46.192 --> 03:56:50.493]  They can silence me, but they cannot silence all of us.
[03:56:51.053 --> 03:56:52.873]  And that is what they are counting on.
[03:56:53.413 --> 03:57:15.417]  So whether it is the coverage of today's controversy regarding Roseanne Barr, or whether it is the truth of what's happening to Tommy Robinson, or whether it is the efforts to, let us say, shadow ban Alex Jones, tell people in your circle by taking those links
[03:57:16.061 --> 03:57:17.642]  Put them on your Facebook page.
[03:57:17.942 --> 03:57:19.342]  Put them in your Twitter feed.
[03:57:19.642 --> 03:57:20.963]  Put them up on Gab.
[03:57:21.023 --> 03:57:22.663]  Put them up on Mines.
[03:57:23.183 --> 03:57:24.164]  Spread the word.
[03:57:24.664 --> 03:57:30.166]  As I said before, they can silence me, but they cannot silence all of us.
[03:57:30.786 --> 03:57:32.446]  Thank you, and God bless you.
[03:57:32.466 --> 03:57:35.548]  And please, stop by the InfoWars.com store.
[03:57:35.968 --> 03:57:37.748]  We need your support.
[03:57:38.288 --> 03:57:39.769]  Victory or death.
[03:58:01.676 --> 03:58:13.941]  You know we're doing world-changing things here, and I decided, because we did this last year, I was looking back at the calendar a few weeks ago, and I noticed that last Memorial Day, we did some of the biggest specials of the year, so we're doing it right now.
[03:58:14.281 --> 03:58:17.463]  A huge raft of specials, great products, chance for you to try them out.
[03:58:17.563 --> 03:58:26.867]  Memorial Day Patriots Special, the vaunted Brain Force with thousands of five-star reviews, and the 4.8 rating, unprecedented, is 50% off, $19.95.
[03:58:29.628 --> 03:58:32.150]  There are formulas that aren't even as good that retail for $60.
[03:58:32.590 --> 03:58:37.454]  You cannot get, from my research, a better nootropic or a price anywhere near this.
