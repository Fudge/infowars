[00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:04.439]  Big Brother.
[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.040]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.702]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:12.144]  Do you want answers?
[00:00:13.105 --> 00:00:14.786]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:21.350]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:32.498]  So, ladies and gentlemen, we've got another absolutely, completely overflowing plate in front of us today.
[00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:39.504]  The 29th day of January 2018 on this Monday Global Transmission.
[00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:45.527]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we have got, as I said, a massively overflowing plate today.
[00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:57.032]  It's been announced, it's up on InfoWars.com, that coming up today at 5 o'clock, we'll be covering it live with Owen Schroer and Roger Stone and myself in the War Room.
[00:00:57.472 --> 00:01:01.454]  House Intel Committee voting Monday 5 p.m.
[00:01:01.474 --> 00:01:02.415]  to release the memo.
[00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:12.062]  So we're gonna be breaking all of that down and Trey Gowdy has come out and foreshadowed what's in it exactly what we told you.
[00:01:12.142 --> 00:01:14.485]  We're gonna play that clip coming up here in just a moment.
[00:01:15.526 --> 00:01:23.754]  We'll play the full clip later in the hour where it's Obama and it's the Hillary campaign working together to create a fake dossier to get a
[00:01:24.554 --> 00:01:30.779]  As I discussed with Mark Short, the Washington Post reports today the President wants to have the memo released.
[00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.619]  Do you agree with that?
[00:01:54.813 --> 00:01:56.094]  Um, I do.
[00:01:56.154 --> 00:01:57.694]  I'm sorry that we're to this point.
[00:01:58.095 --> 00:02:09.140]  Um, this memo is nothing but a, a, um, the distilling, uh, the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the Department and the Bureau.
[00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.322]  So, there's nothing in this memo that the Department is not already aware of.
[00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:33.499]  If you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before it was used, whether or not it's ever been vetted, if you are interested in who paid for the dossier, if you're interested in Christopher Steele's relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee, then yes, you'll want the memo to come out.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.761]  If you're Adam Schiff, who is
[00:02:37.603 --> 00:02:40.966]  Consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure.
[00:02:41.026 --> 00:02:43.448]  He didn't want us to find out any of this information, Chris.
[00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.829]  He fought.
[00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.911]  In fact, GPS went to court.
[00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:47.912]  Fusion GPS went to court.
[00:02:47.932 --> 00:03:04.026]  We're going to get to more of this when we come back from break, but just as the Epoch Times themselves, great journalists, reverse engineered what is going to be in this memo, there you have more confirmation from our congressional sources, as we told you two weeks ago and again last week, that
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:17.990]  It is the roadmap of the fraud and it's how they did it and it's a timeline of it with exhibits for each piece and the core of it is the 99 page FISA report that has excise parts that are in the memo.
[00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.415]  They just chose to call this the secret FISA memo because they're also using that as the roadmap to show the perjury.
[00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:31.400]  So as I told you two weeks ago and on last Monday it is a compendium
[00:03:33.675 --> 00:03:34.716]  Of the investigation.
[00:03:34.796 --> 00:03:36.277]  It is the indictment in the House.
[00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:38.278]  That's what the House is supposed to do.
[00:03:38.678 --> 00:03:40.199]  It's the public indictment of these people.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.700]  So there you go.
[00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.322]  Next week's news today.
[00:03:43.782 --> 00:03:47.484]  And then coming up, the lowest ratings ever for the Grammys.
[00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:55.650]  Just a wall-to-wall circus of disconnected loons trying to create racism and division in this country.
[00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.654]  And Hillary showing up in the middle of it to promote the fiction book, Fire and Fury.
[00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.113]  One reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's.
[00:04:07.473 --> 00:04:11.217]  Nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.
[00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:12.358]  That's it, we've got it.
[00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:13.019]  That's the one.
[00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.820]  You think so?
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.120]  Oh yeah.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.301]  The Grammy's in the bag?
[00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:15.942]  In the bag.
[00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:18.625]  Look at that psycho smile.
[00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:21.027]  They don't get everyone hates celery.
[00:04:21.468 --> 00:04:25.212]  They don't get this puts them into deeper hot water.
[00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:27.434]  They don't understand it.
[00:04:29.284 --> 00:04:31.825]  They just keep pushing and pushing, but some of the Democrats do.
[00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.727]  They've been trying to show the Clintons the door for about a year, and they won't go away.
[00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:46.271]  That's why the New York Times came out and fired a giant warning torpedo at Hillary, who is a sexual enabler of serious predators.
[00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:51.513]  We'll break down what really is the end of the Clintons and their whole crime network when we come back.
[00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:56.915]  Frank and

[00:06:23.118 --> 00:06:27.142]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live and we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:27.683 --> 00:06:28.844]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:28.864 --> 00:06:32.687]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday Transmission.
[00:06:34.082 --> 00:06:46.308]  Coming up tomorrow, we're going to have live coverage at Infowars.com, live video and audio coverage that a lot of radio and TV stations are now picking up of the President's first State of the Union.
[00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:54.473]  And then we're going to have that followed by the Maxine Waters, or James Brown in drag, comedy rebuttal.
[00:06:55.373 --> 00:06:57.414]  She's going to be on BET.
[00:06:57.975 --> 00:07:02.217]  And we're going to have some of the other comedy rebuttals of other Democrats as well.
[00:07:04.605 --> 00:07:05.586]  So look forward to that.
[00:07:05.686 --> 00:07:13.750]  I will be here tomorrow night, Han showing that with the rest of the amazing crew of analysts and we'll have guests on.
[00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:27.498]  And we intend to carry it live right through, the War Room ends at 6, we're just going to extend live coverage right through, right through 7 o'clock central, right through the hour and a half address, right up until midnight, taking your phone calls.
[00:07:27.578 --> 00:07:28.159]  So Trump's
[00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:33.241]  First State of the Union live coverage Tuesday January 30th at 7 p.m.
[00:07:33.361 --> 00:07:49.668]  Central but it's gonna be ongoing even before that because we've added obviously the War Room and the Real News and all these other daily transmissions as we promised to do followed by the James Brown comedy rebuttal that we'll be analyzing and carrying from BET.
[00:07:50.108 --> 00:07:51.288]  So that is all coming up.
[00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:57.091]  Infowars.com forward slash show and many stations across the country and it will be family-oriented
[00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:59.153]  We will have the delays in place.
[00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:13.128]  Years ago I would do some of these live coverages, maybe internet only, and I'd let a few potty words through, but we've assured our stations and all of our affiliates, just like the main InfoWars show that I do for four hours every day, that we will have the
[00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:21.415]  Video and audio delays in place for all of our UHF, VHF and cable stations that are picking up the transmission.
[00:08:21.855 --> 00:08:28.119]  We're becoming big boys now and behaving like we should, even though CNN doesn't have to and ABC doesn't have to.
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.863]  They all put cuss words, sex, men having sex, you name it, on television.
[00:08:33.143 --> 00:08:42.250]  But if we would show SJW is flipping people off, but beep the cussing, but show the flipping off, leftists file complaints.
[00:08:43.359 --> 00:08:46.003]  See, that's not how conservatives or libertarians or patriots are.
[00:08:46.263 --> 00:08:51.150]  So people ask, why don't you cuss like all the other liberal broadcasts do now?
[00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.192]  And it's true.
[00:08:52.232 --> 00:08:53.654]  On radio stations, they're cussing now.
[00:08:53.674 --> 00:08:54.815]  I hear it locally in Austin.
[00:08:56.332 --> 00:08:57.893]  They're God.
[00:08:57.974 --> 00:08:58.974]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:10.224]  Plus, I've got a large vernacular, and I've got a pretty good mental thesaurus and lexicon for my verbal palate, and so I really don't need to use those words.
[00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:14.447]  But sometimes, you know, you need to call Bill Clinton a sack of you-know-what.
[00:09:14.968 --> 00:09:19.191]  And, you know, sometimes you gotta admit that places like Hades are you-know-what holes.
[00:09:19.972 --> 00:09:22.413]  We're not putting Haiti down, it's stating, it's a crap hole.
[00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.455]  A lot of Haitian leaders said, absolutely right.
[00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:29.618]  After we got robbed by the Clintons and everybody else, it became an even worse one.
[00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:35.881]  Now speaking of that, they're going to be releasing, I believe they're going to vote, they have the votes, so I'm going to just say it here.
[00:09:36.282 --> 00:09:38.143]  They're going to vote to release the memo
[00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:45.455]  At 5 o'clock Eastern today, 4 o'clock Central, we're going to be covering it live.
[00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:48.860]  No longer extended coverage as we have the War Room but three hours after.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.664]  Owen Schroer and others will be covering it live today.
[00:09:51.684 --> 00:09:53.827]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:09:54.528 --> 00:09:55.969]  The president says he wants it released.
[00:09:55.989 --> 00:09:59.691]  The president unilaterally could release it himself, but it's Congress's report.
[00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:01.912]  That's really what they're calling a memo, but it's a report.
[00:10:02.832 --> 00:10:07.234]  And so I think that they've got the votes and I think it's going to happen.
[00:10:07.274 --> 00:10:12.217]  In fact, I'm going to say they're going to vote to release that memo today.
[00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.161]  They're not going to conference with the Justice Department.
[00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:18.244]  They're going to play games with Sessions, who they've definitely got something on.
[00:10:18.264 --> 00:10:25.130]  They are going to release it, big and bold, today at 4 o'clock Central, 5 o'clock Eastern.
[00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:34.899]  So, whether you're a truck driver, or somebody listening on an app, or local radio station, or whatever, you can always find the live video feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:10:37.642 --> 00:10:49.067]  That said, Trey Gowdy has come out and told you exactly what I said two weeks ago, and what I said on Monday, and the mainstream media said it was fake news, and some of the patriot media that's jealous said it was fake news.
[00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:53.469]  We have a ton of congressional sources, obviously.
[00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.811]  And most of those sources remain anonymous.
[00:10:58.851 --> 00:11:03.733]  And I don't just have Roger Stone that has dinner weekly with multiple members of Congress and people that are on these committees.
[00:11:03.753 --> 00:11:04.714]  We have other sources.
[00:11:05.674 --> 00:11:07.515]  And we know what's in the memo.
[00:11:07.995 --> 00:11:17.019]  It's a roadmap of thousands of pages of documents linked up with the FISA Court 99-page memo that's about 10% redacted.
[00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:19.520]  The redacted parts is who ordered it, who did it.
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:20.861]  Obama.
[00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:22.041]  It's all in there.
[00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:23.162]  DNC's involved.
[00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:23.562]  You name it.
[00:11:24.775 --> 00:11:31.260]  And it's all tied in and then shows their perjury to Congress, not just the collusion, the political manipulation.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.083]  And Trey Gowdy has come out and said just that.
[00:11:35.224 --> 00:11:36.825]  We'll be breaking that down in the next segment.
[00:11:37.045 --> 00:11:47.354]  But first, let's get to how the establishment is in a civil war, not just between patriots, not just between
[00:11:49.898 --> 00:11:52.380]  The deep state and people that want to make the country great again.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:59.645]  But you've got a civil war between libertarian constitutional style Republicans against blue blood establishment Republicans.
[00:11:59.986 --> 00:12:13.116]  And then you've got the Democratic Party that's got some savvy people in it that realize the total race war communist narrative that they want to carry out down the road has been launched too early via hubris and too much confidence.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.042]  And so it's waking people up, not bullying them into submission anymore.
[00:12:18.662 --> 00:12:32.990]  And they've tried to show the Clintons the door over and over and over and over and over again, and keep bringing out more and more of the scandals, but the reflexes at mainstream media are still to defend.
[00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.111]  It's a very schizophrenic fight going on.
[00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:40.294]  But you see Hillary showing up at the Grammys,
[00:12:42.113 --> 00:12:50.937]  Being part of this hate fest against the President and America's recovery, and they're so disconnected, then they wonder why it had the lowest ratings ever.
[00:12:51.197 --> 00:12:54.239]  Or why the NFL is falling apart with the lowest ratings ever.
[00:12:54.999 --> 00:12:56.219]  Or why any of this is happening.
[00:12:56.239 --> 00:12:57.760]  Because the economy's coming back.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.901]  Because people want to work together.
[00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:01.102]  They don't want to fight with each other.
[00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.622]  They don't want to be demoralized.
[00:13:03.423 --> 00:13:05.043]  They don't want to be manipulated.
[00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.904]  They don't want to be controlled anymore.
[00:13:06.944 --> 00:13:07.665]  They want freedom.
[00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:10.146]  And so there's a big turning.
[00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:28.043]  Away from the system right now, and because Hillary Clinton doesn't know when to quit, because Hillary Clinton doesn't know when to back off, the New York Times itself has come out and said Hillary Clinton chose to shield a top advisor accused of harassment in 2008.
[00:13:28.743 --> 00:13:30.545]  And these articles are coming out every day.
[00:13:30.665 --> 00:13:37.310]  She represented men that kidnapped an 11-year-old girl and gang-raped her, broke her job,
[00:13:38.482 --> 00:13:49.747]  Knocked one of her eyes in and raped her so hard it crushed her cervix and caused not just a prolapse, you want to get graphic, but her guts to start coming out of her.
[00:13:50.207 --> 00:13:50.507]  Okay?
[00:13:51.067 --> 00:14:04.113]  So these are grown men raping a little girl they grabbed off her bicycle for more than 10 hours at a shotgun shack out in the woods, drunk on whiskey, and because they were good old boys and part of the establishment, that was the first client she had.
[00:14:04.943 --> 00:14:05.744]  And then it went from there.
[00:14:05.784 --> 00:14:08.725]  She preferred pedophiles and rapists and scum.
[00:14:09.126 --> 00:14:10.487]  That's who she supports.
[00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:13.028]  And you see her only with those people today.
[00:14:13.869 --> 00:14:16.550]  The Harvey Weinsteins and the rest of these folks.
[00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:19.913]  And that's what they think of you and your family.
[00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:22.855]  That's why she's on the Lolita Express with a convicted child rapist.
[00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:26.117]  It's why our own employees get caught shipping people out of the country.
[00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:34.162]  And so she has this disgusting performance at the Grammys reading out of the fiction book, Fire and Fury.
[00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:38.570]  About how Trump goes to sleep at 6.30 at night.
[00:14:41.193 --> 00:14:42.594]  Well see, there's a kernel of truth to that.
[00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:50.644]  Sometimes he may take a 30 minute nap, takes a shower, his habits are well known, then he goes back to work for a whole second round.
[00:14:50.684 --> 00:14:54.629]  But yeah, he takes off, takes a shower each dinner, sits around in a bathrobe for an hour.
[00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.953]  Hangs out with his wife, and then goes back to work.
[00:14:58.993 --> 00:15:00.814]  That's what most executive men do.
[00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.415]  They work 12, 14, 16 hours a day.
[00:15:04.276 --> 00:15:06.177]  Go home, see your family a couple hours, go back to work.
[00:15:06.497 --> 00:15:07.218]  That's what I do.
[00:15:07.738 --> 00:15:08.218]  Many days.
[00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:16.544]  But the point is, is that they sit there mixing truth with all these lies, and then they wonder why everyone is turning against them.
[00:15:16.884 --> 00:15:18.265]  They wonder why everybody hates them.
[00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:24.649]  They wonder why everything they touch turns to garbage, but they don't know how to give up, so they have this train wreck.
[00:15:26.121 --> 00:15:27.081]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.257 --> 00:16:16.568]  Over a year in the making, produced by one of the top organic firms in the country, that if you want proven studies and documentation, I can speak for hours just on the files I have here, of what this is proven to do, the ingredients in this, this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year, any time of the year.
[00:16:16.648 --> 00:16:22.052]  But immune wall is incredible, and folks, other formulas that aren't even as good are $70, $80.
[00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:23.773]  It's a great deal at $39.
[00:16:24.293 --> 00:16:26.895]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf,
[00:16:27.535 --> 00:16:28.516]  And so much more.
[00:16:29.077 --> 00:16:30.198]  It is concentrated.
[00:16:30.438 --> 00:16:32.139]  You need to go read what is in here.
[00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:37.864]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[00:16:37.964 --> 00:16:39.165]  A citrus peel blend.
[00:16:39.185 --> 00:16:41.107]  I mean, this is the next level.
[00:16:41.207 --> 00:16:43.589]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, Immune Wall.
[00:16:43.789 --> 00:16:45.051]  I think it's beyond seasonal.
[00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:47.052]  Beta, glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[00:16:47.593 --> 00:16:48.193]  Immune Wall.
[00:16:48.313 --> 00:16:49.615]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:16:59.568 --> 00:17:03.890]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.771]  Op-op-op-optimum levels.
[00:17:06.811 --> 00:17:11.433]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[00:17:11.453 --> 00:17:13.374]  Op-op-op-optimum levels.
[00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:15.395]  B vitamins we need every day.
[00:17:15.595 --> 00:17:20.677]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:22.458]  Op-op-op-optimal absorption.
[00:17:23.198 --> 00:17:28.241]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[00:17:28.821 --> 00:17:29.162]  Secret 12.
[00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:31.543]  Optimal absorption.
[00:17:31.823 --> 00:17:36.506]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[00:17:36.946 --> 00:17:41.149]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[00:17:42.149 --> 00:17:42.870]  Optimum levels.
[00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:48.115]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[00:17:48.456 --> 00:17:52.801]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.
[00:17:53.061 --> 00:17:55.424]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:17:55.844 --> 00:17:56.665]  Mike in Arizona.
[00:17:56.685 --> 00:17:57.726]  You're on the air worldwide.
[00:17:57.746 --> 00:17:58.067]  Go ahead.
[00:17:58.989 --> 00:18:00.871]  Oh, Alex, you can rant any day of the week.
[00:18:00.911 --> 00:18:10.319]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.783]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener, I want to say thanks.
[00:18:15.223 --> 00:18:15.563]  Absolutely.
[00:18:37.689 --> 00:18:50.914]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand that there's bigger problems going on and if we can get our houses in order and be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.522]  Introducing CellForce by InfoWars Life.
[00:18:59.163 --> 00:19:02.705]  CellForce focuses on mitochondria efficiency and protection.
[00:19:03.126 --> 00:19:06.068]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[00:19:06.468 --> 00:19:08.450]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.414]  CellForce helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria.
[00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:15.795]  Much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[00:19:16.076 --> 00:19:22.461]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:23.081 --> 00:19:30.308]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:35.954]  The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[00:19:36.334 --> 00:19:43.321]  The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[00:19:43.962 --> 00:19:48.445]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force from InfoWarsLife.
[00:19:48.885 --> 00:19:51.727]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:19:51.807 --> 00:19:53.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.124 --> 00:20:19.896]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:20.757 --> 00:20:21.498]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:20:21.578 --> 00:20:22.619]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:27.826]  Newswars.com and Infowars.com as well as PrisonPlanet.com are our sites.
[00:20:29.167 --> 00:20:32.850]  We have multiple sites because over the years they try to hack them, they try to shut them down.
[00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:36.032]  We've got so much news and so many videos and so many things we cover.
[00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:42.036]  We also have a lot of news that's on NewsWars.com that is exclusive to NewsWars.com.
[00:20:42.436 --> 00:20:43.657]  Same thing with PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:20:45.023 --> 00:20:50.430]  Gert Welder storms Hungary, praises Orban, slams EU and open borders.
[00:20:50.991 --> 00:20:53.554]  Powerful video is also embedded in the article.
[00:20:53.894 --> 00:20:55.416]  It's on newswars.com.
[00:20:55.536 --> 00:21:02.305]  As nationalism and the march for populism expands worldwide, we're not just fighting the globalists to retake America.
[00:21:03.513 --> 00:21:04.694]  Here in the United States.
[00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:07.915]  We are fighting the globalists worldwide.
[00:21:08.195 --> 00:21:16.619]  And the more countries start pulling out of globalism and getting back to economies based on free market and populism, the more competition globalism has.
[00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:18.800]  Because it's authoritarian, it's command and control.
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:26.225]  So, these victories around the world against the globalists, unelected systems, are victories against authoritarianism.
[00:21:26.666 --> 00:21:31.930]  Just like the victories we had over the Soviet Union, and the communist scourge, and the victories we had over Hitler.
[00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:33.651]  It doesn't mean we're perfect.
[00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:37.995]  It means that those true evils are being defeated.
[00:21:38.055 --> 00:21:39.476]  Those ideologies are being defeated.
[00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:45.120]  And the globalist ideology is the ideology that went and put communism into Russia.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:45.841]  It's on record.
[00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:47.782]  The very same program.
[00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:52.631]  Coming up today, we're going to have live coverage of it.
[00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:58.796]  It's 5 o'clock Eastern, 4 o'clock Central, House Intel Committee.
[00:21:59.835 --> 00:22:00.616]  Voting today.
[00:22:00.916 --> 00:22:02.558]  As I told you last week, we broke.
[00:22:03.318 --> 00:22:07.462]  I was told by members of Congress last Monday to look for next Monday's vote.
[00:22:08.043 --> 00:22:13.528]  That was then codified over the Friday, and now they're going to have the vote today.
[00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:17.452]  And I only make that point because people say, oh, Jones, you're making this stuff up.
[00:22:17.492 --> 00:22:18.413]  You don't have these sources.
[00:22:19.774 --> 00:22:20.935]  Yeah, I do have these sources.
[00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:25.626]  And again, they're like, we're not 100% sure, but it looks like next Monday.
[00:22:25.827 --> 00:22:28.350]  And I said they're not 100% sure, but it looks like next Monday.
[00:22:28.711 --> 00:22:32.175]  And then, five days later on Friday, they said it'll be Monday, we don't know what time.
[00:22:32.536 --> 00:22:33.878]  And now today, they said 5 o'clock.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.602]  So again, House Intel Committee voting Monday 5 p.m.
[00:22:39.642 --> 00:22:40.522]  to release the memo.
[00:22:41.322 --> 00:22:49.045]  After the legislative branch votes to release the memo, it would immediately be given to President Trump's executive branch for his review and approval of public release.
[00:22:49.865 --> 00:22:56.388]  And so the word is, look for it to be released by Tuesday, Wednesday is the word?
[00:22:57.403 --> 00:23:00.085]  Because Congress is its own system.
[00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:04.368]  The President's own DOJ is bucking him, saying, don't release it.
[00:23:05.109 --> 00:23:09.452]  But the President's the President, and he can declassify anything he wants.
[00:23:12.575 --> 00:23:14.536]  And the bureaucracy acts like it's the President.
[00:23:15.537 --> 00:23:16.598]  Oh no, you can't do that!
[00:23:16.838 --> 00:23:18.740]  All this is is a roadmap of criminality.
[00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.402]  And that's why it's about to come out.
[00:23:23.783 --> 00:23:25.365]  They're calling it the Big Ugly.
[00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:34.996]  And just as I said last week from our sources, Alex, Alex, yes, some of what you've got in that memo, and it's good you're covering that memo, is in this.
[00:23:35.096 --> 00:23:37.317]  Yes, that's why we're calling it the secret FISA memo.
[00:23:37.577 --> 00:23:38.558]  There are secret sections.
[00:23:38.618 --> 00:23:39.999]  It's the roadmap of the perjury.
[00:23:40.973 --> 00:23:54.859]  And it's going to tie into everything and how the Democratic Party and Hillary was working with Obama and the Justice Department and the FBI and then the media to leak false leaks and now that was illegal and it's a roadmap of the year and a half of this garbage going on.
[00:23:55.439 --> 00:23:57.140]  That's what I said last week from our sources.
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.502]  Here is Trey Gowdy last night on Mr. Wallace's program on Fox News.
[00:24:02.613 --> 00:24:09.917]  As I discussed with Mark Short, the Washington Post reports today the President wants to have the memo released.
[00:24:10.757 --> 00:24:11.538]  Do you agree with that?
[00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:14.319]  I do.
[00:24:14.399 --> 00:24:15.920]  I'm sorry that we're to this point.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:27.386]  This memo is nothing but the distilling, the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the Department and the Bureau.
[00:24:27.446 --> 00:24:31.548]  So there's nothing in this memo that the Department is not already aware of.
[00:24:32.668 --> 00:24:51.705]  If you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before it was used, whether or not it's ever been vetted, if you are interested in who paid for the dossier, if you're interested in Christopher Steele's relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee, then yes, you'll want the memo to come out.
[00:24:52.065 --> 00:24:53.987]  If you're Adam Schiff, who is
[00:24:55.828 --> 00:24:59.209]  Consistently wrong when it comes to issues of disclosure.
[00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:01.650]  He didn't want us to find out any of this information, Chris.
[00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:03.031]  He fought.
[00:25:03.111 --> 00:25:05.092]  In fact, GPS went to court.
[00:25:05.132 --> 00:25:10.133]  Fusion GPS went to court to keep us from finding out that the Democrats paid for the dossier.
[00:25:10.193 --> 00:25:13.815]  So, if you're Adam Schiff, of course you don't want the information to come out.
[00:25:13.875 --> 00:25:15.896]  You didn't want us to find it in the first place.
[00:25:16.356 --> 00:25:22.018]  This memo answers what I think are really legitimate questions, and I do think the FBI should look at it.
[00:25:23.757 --> 00:25:27.200]  And also, the Justice Department paid at least $2 million.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:34.005]  That's confirmed, but you read media reports, fake news, and they go, oh, and there was no money paid, because that right there is super illegal.
[00:25:34.853 --> 00:25:36.574]  Especially because it was going to their own family members.
[00:25:36.714 --> 00:26:02.766]  So, that's right, Justice Department and FBI agents had money going to their wives and husbands that worked at Fusion GPS, who were just hired on to create the dossier, obviously, with the information that they wanted in the dossier, the made-up garbage being conduited over from the Justice Department and FBI to be added on to the compendium of opposition research that had been started by the Bushes and the globalists going back two years before that.
[00:26:03.945 --> 00:26:08.608]  So you really get a bird's eye view into how this whole thing works behind the scenes.
[00:26:08.648 --> 00:26:10.890]  Let's go back to Mr. Gowdy.
[00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:18.094]  Before it is released, and I have provided that counsel to Chairman Nunes, and I think that he has taken that under advisement.
[00:26:18.134 --> 00:26:19.855]  So I want to play face-up poker.
[00:26:19.935 --> 00:26:22.177]  I want the Bureau to know everything that's in the memo.
[00:26:22.777 --> 00:26:23.878]  I think you'll be surprised.
[00:26:23.958 --> 00:26:27.080]  It is not a hit piece on the department and the FBI.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:29.522]  I would not have participated in it if that's what it was.
[00:26:30.422 --> 00:26:51.202]  Pick up on this, because the reports are, and you've kind of indicated that in your answer, that the memo centers on this question of the FISA application, the Department of Justice, FBI application in 2016 for a warrant to conduct electronic surveillance against this fellow, then Trump campaign manager, Carter Page.
[00:26:51.842 --> 00:27:06.396]  Your complaint, according to reports, is that you say that when they made that application, they didn't talk about the role of the Russia dossier, and especially the fact that it was opposition research paid for by the Clinton campaign.
[00:27:06.696 --> 00:27:10.180]  The Democrats, and yes, Adam Schiff is leading the charge, say you're cherry picking
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.842]  The FBI did not rely just on the dossier to get the warrant.
[00:27:28.348 --> 00:27:37.657]  Well, I can't even confirm for you that there is a FISA warrant and I can't confirm for you who it's on because that is classified and I'm not going to disseminate classified information.
[00:27:37.797 --> 00:27:47.546]  I'll just ask you again, are you interested in whether or not the world's premier law enforcement agency relied on a work product produced, paid for by the Democrat National Committee?
[00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:49.608]  Now again,
[00:27:50.649 --> 00:27:55.532]  And the report put out by FISA Court says some of this stuff's illegal.
[00:27:55.932 --> 00:27:57.473]  And they went back and told Obama that.
[00:27:57.553 --> 00:27:58.313]  That's the memo.
[00:27:58.614 --> 00:28:00.595]  And the blacked out parts are who ordered it.
[00:28:01.835 --> 00:28:03.917]  And those people have told Congress they didn't order it.
[00:28:04.037 --> 00:28:04.737]  That's perjury.
[00:28:05.077 --> 00:28:06.038]  That's what Gowdy's saying.
[00:28:06.078 --> 00:28:07.859]  He can't tell you the secret parts.
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:14.523]  And then they play the semantical game where they go, oh, you know, we don't even know
[00:28:16.116 --> 00:28:19.199]  If you've got a FISA warrant or whatever, when it's on record, it's there.
[00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:23.182]  He's just saying the exact specifics of it.
[00:28:24.537 --> 00:28:32.983]  So if you want to understand, it's all right there and it's a roadmap to their perjury and all of their incredible lies.
[00:28:55.577 --> 00:29:04.421]  I set out with top researchers, top scientists, top developers, with the biggest organic producer in the country, to come out with Immune Wall.
[00:29:05.642 --> 00:29:07.442]  Because it's backed by clinical studies.
[00:29:07.482 --> 00:29:14.605]  The compounds that are in it are the latest, modern, patented technology that we can even make claims on.
[00:29:15.025 --> 00:29:20.788]  But then it's got all the ancient herbs that line up their compounds with it, dead.
[00:29:21.508 --> 00:29:22.809]  Our ancestors knew, worked.
[00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:42.484]  So let me just briefly tell you that historic story and invite you to get your immune wall for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors today, all those you love, because you can support your own body, build a greater wall, a greater defense against viruses, bacteria, outside microbes, boost your immune system, and boost
[00:29:43.565 --> 00:29:47.692]  Humanity's immune system to build basic societies of liberty and freedom.
[00:29:48.012 --> 00:29:50.556]  Because I'm not into the magic or the occult.
[00:29:50.636 --> 00:29:53.300]  A lot of the stuff that hermetic people talked about a thousand years ago is true.
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.762]  As above so below.
[00:29:55.303 --> 00:29:58.127]  What you see happening on the mass scale is also happening on the...
[00:29:59.008 --> 00:30:00.109]  Most tiny of scales.
[00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:01.710]  And that's what this comes down to.
[00:30:02.111 --> 00:30:03.612]  America is building its wall.
[00:30:04.012 --> 00:30:04.493]  Will it work?
[00:30:04.613 --> 00:30:05.133]  We don't know.
[00:30:05.613 --> 00:30:06.214]  Is Trump right?
[00:30:06.895 --> 00:30:09.016]  Well, he's trying to at least follow through on his promise.
[00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:15.482]  But we can build a wall in our own life that's been proven to work, and without this wall, we would all die.
[00:30:15.862 --> 00:30:21.747]  We set out to bring you the very best immune capsule for yourself and your family, and I know it's going to be a bestseller.
[00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:28.794]  I want you all to try it, so you reorder it, you fund the InfoWar, our world's a better place, you're healthier, you name it.
[00:30:29.535 --> 00:30:44.550]  So that's why, out of the gates, the normal MSRP is $39.95, but we're doing 25% off, $29.95, despite the fact that other similar formulas are $50, $60, $70, and aren't as organic and aren't as fresh.
[00:30:45.211 --> 00:30:47.572]  This is a 360 non-zero-sum game win.
[00:30:48.232 --> 00:30:55.515]  You will get Immune Wall and other great products at InfoWarsLife.com, discounted, delivered to your door, and you're helping fund our operation.
[00:30:56.255 --> 00:30:56.995]  I'm so excited.
[00:30:57.055 --> 00:31:06.619]  The new product at InfoWarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the Real Red Pill.
[00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:09.360]  This is a heart and brain pill.
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.503]  A nootropic doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate, because it's beyond that.
[00:31:15.723 --> 00:31:24.467]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:31.383]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[00:31:31.903 --> 00:31:34.664]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[00:31:34.804 --> 00:31:45.687]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[00:31:46.187 --> 00:31:47.488]  It is amazing!
[00:31:48.868 --> 00:31:53.850]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsTore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[00:31:55.669 --> 00:32:03.356]  You know, I've got some talking points here about Caveman from Infowarsandlife.com, but instead of going over those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[00:32:04.216 --> 00:32:08.280]  From all the wives' tales in every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.122]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[00:32:11.923 --> 00:32:15.026]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[00:32:16.536 --> 00:32:28.664]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[00:32:29.364 --> 00:32:44.414]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[00:32:45.414 --> 00:32:49.138]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com what it could do for your family.
[00:32:49.698 --> 00:32:51.400]  And again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.283]  You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[00:33:00.148 --> 00:33:02.771]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:11.103 --> 00:33:11.843]  Big Brother.
[00:33:12.103 --> 00:33:13.384]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:13.765 --> 00:33:14.925]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:16.126]  You want answers?
[00:33:16.427 --> 00:33:17.647]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:18.508 --> 00:33:28.996]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:30.077]  Speaking of congressmen...
[00:33:30.987 --> 00:33:37.269]  We've got a congressman very close to the entire investigation and the memo joining us today.
[00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:47.652]  I'm just going to leave it at that until they join us, because we're still lining up some of that congressman's office that we've been in touch with and working with and working with via Stone and others.
[00:33:48.032 --> 00:33:48.752]  So that's coming up.
[00:33:49.232 --> 00:33:49.992]  This just in!
[00:33:51.873 --> 00:33:59.095]  He was going to leave in six months so he could get his full retirement, but FBI
[00:34:00.114 --> 00:34:04.717]  Director Andrew McCabe, frequent target of Trump's ire, steps down.
[00:34:04.777 --> 00:34:07.519]  He is the acting director NBC News.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:21.570]  No, he has been caught as the man quarterbacking, commanding, captaining, generaling, field marshalling, honchoing, controlling, mastering,
[00:34:22.782 --> 00:34:46.461]  The entire fake dossier and the group, the Secret Society, the insurance policy organization inside running the ridiculous Russiagate program that we all laugh at, but they are intending to take the president out and kill the recovery with this thing, this fiction made up by John Podesta and Hillary Clinton.
[00:34:47.962 --> 00:34:49.763]  So this is a big, big deal.
[00:34:49.883 --> 00:34:51.645]  FBI Director Andrew McCabe
[00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:55.788]  He said a month ago that he's going to take his time and leave in six months.
[00:34:57.649 --> 00:35:00.450]  You're gone because you know what's in that memo, buster.
[00:35:01.571 --> 00:35:03.652]  Your name is blacked out.
[00:35:04.672 --> 00:35:05.993]  And so is Obama's name.
[00:35:08.094 --> 00:35:12.516]  And then we've got the memos in between you and the Democratic National Committee and the New York Times.
[00:35:13.016 --> 00:35:14.717]  I mean, that's even in what's been released.
[00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:15.917]  I mean, here's the whole map of it.
[00:35:16.417 --> 00:35:17.138]  You're watching on TV.
[00:35:19.141 --> 00:35:20.342]  This is all coming up in just a moment.
[00:35:20.662 --> 00:35:27.446]  By the way, I am so excited that I don't even really want to say this on air because everybody knows I don't hype stuff unless it's really hype-worthy.
[00:35:29.067 --> 00:35:44.096]  We've always been working to get on UHF and VHF stations and some cable systems, but we've mainly focused on getting on AM and FM stations, and we've had some pretty big success being the largest independent radio show in the country.
[00:35:45.217 --> 00:35:48.739]  But I don't know what's going on, but I guess our time has come.
[00:35:49.926 --> 00:35:54.969]  But three or four years ago, I got a good satellite, but it wasn't the exact right satellite.
[00:35:56.149 --> 00:35:58.070]  And it's not exactly what all the stations wanted.
[00:35:59.591 --> 00:36:01.652]  This week, I'm signing three deals.
[00:36:02.073 --> 00:36:05.454]  Would have done it last week, but the main guy over this had the flu last week, CJ.
[00:36:06.975 --> 00:36:11.978]  To have three different satellites that are what the stations across the country are asking for.
[00:36:11.998 --> 00:36:12.878]  And let me explain something.
[00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:17.661]  The owners and managers of these stations are sick of what's going on.
[00:36:19.574 --> 00:36:23.598]  And they're wanting to pick us up two hours, three hours, six hours, ten hours.
[00:36:23.998 --> 00:36:27.021]  They know it's going to be spectacular publicity as well.
[00:36:27.842 --> 00:36:32.206]  But there's also a glut of UHF, VHF and cable and you got all the channels.
[00:36:32.726 --> 00:36:38.211]  Beck went and again spent $25 million a year just on a channel for himself, a vanity exercise.
[00:36:38.751 --> 00:36:45.858]  Because you got tens of thousands of channels, that's nothing if you don't have carriage rights and if you're not low on the tier in the first hundred channels.
[00:36:48.018 --> 00:36:59.811]  That's why I had a plan three years ago to start targeting UHF, VHF, and cable, but I didn't never really promote it or got it all launched as I was hiring people, building studios.
[00:36:59.831 --> 00:37:05.738]  We got like 20-something or more TV stations and other 12 or so cable systems I know of, but now I'm starting to get calls.
[00:37:06.638 --> 00:37:18.873]  From people all over, Hollywood folks, you name it, going, man, I'm in, like, Louisiana, or I'm in New York, or I'm in Minnesota, and I'm turning on cable, and you're on, you know, the local NBC channel.
[00:37:19.013 --> 00:37:19.954]  Like, your whole show!
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.680]  And then I call the station.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.841]  They go, yeah, we're picking you up.
[00:37:23.861 --> 00:37:24.701]  You said you're free to air.
[00:37:25.221 --> 00:37:25.861]  Beautiful.
[00:37:26.221 --> 00:37:26.762]  Beautiful.
[00:37:27.342 --> 00:37:29.102]  But we're getting rid of that satellite in a month.
[00:37:29.662 --> 00:37:30.863]  And we're getting three new ones.
[00:37:30.903 --> 00:37:32.263]  So I gotta let everybody know about those.
[00:37:32.703 --> 00:37:33.644]  And that's what we're doing here.
[00:37:33.684 --> 00:37:34.584]  Just to report to you.
[00:37:34.644 --> 00:37:36.444]  Now, that's why they're coming after us.
[00:37:36.504 --> 00:37:41.246]  And I'm not... I'm not able to tell you about some of the behind-the-scenes stuff yet.
[00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:42.246]  I'm looking forward to it.
[00:37:43.366 --> 00:37:47.067]  But we've had some big victories against the globalists and caught them in some really serious things.
[00:37:47.127 --> 00:37:49.208]  And, I mean, you don't just think Hillary and
[00:37:50.689 --> 00:37:54.912]  Soros and all these people attack me every day in the news, and they have congressional hearings saying, shut me down.
[00:37:55.272 --> 00:37:57.494]  You don't think they're not trying stuff behind the scenes, right?
[00:37:58.915 --> 00:38:02.237]  The good news is, there's not just good in the world.
[00:38:02.557 --> 00:38:04.058]  There's not just evil in the world.
[00:38:04.098 --> 00:38:07.000]  There's not just people that are apathetic in the world.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.361]  There's God in the world.
[00:38:09.041 --> 00:38:10.262]  And there's providence in the world.
[00:38:10.682 --> 00:38:15.766]  And because there are good people that resonate with God's overall vision and plan,
[00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:18.282]  We've got providence.
[00:38:18.502 --> 00:38:25.907]  So, there's not just good, there's not just bad, there's not just apathetic, there's not just the ugly, there's not just the, you know, the strong, there's not just the weak.
[00:38:26.487 --> 00:38:29.409]  There's God, and we forget that on this planet in deep space.
[00:38:29.429 --> 00:38:33.012]  There is a power that built us, that obviously created us.
[00:38:33.372 --> 00:38:34.893]  Anyone who's tuned into reality knows it.
[00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:36.334]  Anyone who studied history knows it.
[00:38:36.374 --> 00:38:42.078]  All these genetic engineers and scientists that were atheists, the more they study the universe, they go, okay, there is a God.
[00:38:42.298 --> 00:38:48.043]  And there's some giant dimensional warp gate holding everything together that's thousands of times stronger than this dimension.
[00:38:48.523 --> 00:38:50.725]  And there you go.
[00:38:52.246 --> 00:38:55.909]  So, amazing things are happening and
[00:38:57.942 --> 00:39:09.969]  The globalists are really pissed off because they know that a lot of station managers and station owners and people that own cable systems, TV stations, and radio stations are just going, you know what?
[00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:11.670]  Alex Jones is right.
[00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:13.751]  He's been under attack all these years.
[00:39:14.412 --> 00:39:16.533]  And if they can shut him down, they can shut us all down.
[00:39:16.593 --> 00:39:19.575]  And people are just saying, we're tired of being intimidated.
[00:39:19.615 --> 00:39:20.695]  We're tired of being bullied.
[00:39:21.035 --> 00:39:26.859]  We're going to put Alex Jones, David Knight, Owen Schroyer, Paul Joseph Watson, you name it, on the air.
[00:39:27.847 --> 00:39:28.447]  And it's happening.
[00:39:29.748 --> 00:39:35.212]  And if you want the scholarly focus, you know, low-key, very listenable, you've got David Knight.
[00:39:35.933 --> 00:39:37.954]  You want Alex Jones, fire-breathing creature?
[00:39:38.374 --> 00:39:38.935]  You've got this.
[00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:43.138]  You want Owen Schroer with, you know, the funny stuff he does and the smarts and all the great guests?
[00:39:43.258 --> 00:39:43.618]  We're here.
[00:39:43.638 --> 00:39:48.602]  And we're going to add more shows and more broadcasts and we're going to go on to the end, whatever the cost may be.
[00:39:49.943 --> 00:39:59.242]  Quoting Winston Churchill, they stormed a restaurant named after him in London and the leftists demanded that the name be changed and all this other stuff.
[00:39:59.723 --> 00:40:00.464]  They capitulate.
[00:40:02.179 --> 00:40:04.281]  And again, that's what it's all about, the endless bullying.
[00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:07.503]  It's time to stop giving in to the bullying of these people.
[00:40:07.543 --> 00:40:08.284]  So that's coming up.
[00:40:08.884 --> 00:40:11.026]  Now, that said, we need to fund our operation.
[00:40:12.207 --> 00:40:15.309]  You hear sponsors for the local stations, you hear them for the radio network, GCN.
[00:40:15.389 --> 00:40:18.351]  I'm still on GCN because it's good to have a backup and I'm a loyal guy.
[00:40:18.651 --> 00:40:20.613]  But, you know, I run my own network, my own operation here.
[00:40:20.953 --> 00:40:22.695]  But they fund themselves, I fund myself.
[00:40:23.315 --> 00:40:24.816]  We sell products directly to you.
[00:40:24.876 --> 00:40:29.320]  But they ridicule, they attack, they try to defeat, they try to test, and it blows up in their face.
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.343]  And when you purchase books, t-shirts, videos, you name it, it makes it all possible.
[00:40:33.543 --> 00:40:35.344]  But you're gonna forget to buy the next time.
[00:40:37.406 --> 00:40:40.669]  You need the high-quality supplements we have, and if you'll simply go there...
[00:40:41.624 --> 00:40:45.686]  And test out the supplements, find out the ones you like, and then sign up for AutoShip.
[00:40:45.986 --> 00:40:47.107]  You'll get an additional 10% off.
[00:40:47.207 --> 00:40:53.050]  You can sign up every 15 days, every 30 days, every 60, every 90, up to every year.
[00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:55.551]  You can order every year you get sent something.
[00:40:56.151 --> 00:40:58.893]  Maybe it's an air filtration system, not that you need to get one every year.
[00:40:58.953 --> 00:41:04.476]  The point is, is that whatever's perishable, whatever is a renewable, whatever it is that you're going to want to reorder,
[00:41:05.416 --> 00:41:08.638]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:09.198 --> 00:41:17.702]  And if you'll just commit to get great products at low prices with us and shop with the good guys, it sets off a chain reaction.
[00:41:19.002 --> 00:41:24.045]  And so, again, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:27.892 --> 00:41:31.795]  We're starting to see the orders rolling in from people sitting there listening and watching on TV stations.
[00:41:31.835 --> 00:41:35.397]  I mean, it's just, it's without us even pushing it, it's just exploding.
[00:41:35.658 --> 00:41:39.300]  So praise God, the cavalry's coming over the ridge here.
[00:41:39.881 --> 00:41:47.666]  And so for all the censorship online and the stuff they've done trying to destroy us, they're not suppressing the signal thanks to you out there.
[00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:48.767]  I want to thank God.
[00:41:48.787 --> 00:41:49.568]  I want to thank my family.
[00:41:49.588 --> 00:41:50.368]  I want to thank this crew.
[00:41:50.729 --> 00:41:51.749]  I want to thank the audience.
[00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:53.631]  I am so humbled.
[00:41:56.552 --> 00:42:04.956]  I found out they've got big publications going around trying to find people to lie and say that I don't believe what I say and that I don't like my audience.
[00:42:06.717 --> 00:42:08.157]  Again, don't believe what I say.
[00:42:08.257 --> 00:42:09.838]  We're building what we've talked about.
[00:42:09.878 --> 00:42:10.918]  We're turning it around.
[00:42:10.958 --> 00:42:11.839]  We're doing it.
[00:42:12.339 --> 00:42:13.880]  That's the proof of believing something.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.761]  I'm 110% committed to this and you know it.
[00:42:17.181 --> 00:42:19.602]  And when you fund us, they can't stop us.

[00:42:52.645 --> 00:42:53.045]  Stay with us.
[00:42:55.506 --> 00:42:57.767]  I want to apologize to listeners.
[00:42:58.727 --> 00:43:01.928]  I lied to you when I told you Trump would win the election, and he did.
[00:43:02.769 --> 00:43:07.050]  I lied to you when I told you that they're admitting that fluoride's causing brain damage, and it turned out I was right.
[00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:12.252]  I lied to you about a global government existing that was trying to take control of our country, which they now admit is true.
[00:43:12.712 --> 00:43:14.734]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:17.256]  Is it one world, the central bankers in charge?
[00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:19.378]  I guess, actually, I didn't lie to you.
[00:43:19.938 --> 00:43:31.968]  And I'm on air every day fighting the globalists as they try to shut down free speech in America, as they try to derail our recovery, as they try to fold us into their world government, open up our borders, hand us over to the Islamic caliphate.
[00:43:32.648 --> 00:43:33.288]  But I'll tell you this.
[00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:41.552]  When I'm on air, I wear a sports jacket and a nice shirt because I respect the fact that you're tuning in and watching and listening to what I have to say.
[00:43:41.972 --> 00:43:44.553]  But we're involved in very, very important activities.
[00:43:44.573 --> 00:43:49.796]  And that's why I want to reach out to you right now and explain something that's so critical.
[00:43:50.236 --> 00:43:55.458]  And that if you grasp it, we'll be able to literally turn the tide even faster against the globalists.
[00:43:55.959 --> 00:43:56.539]  And it's just this.
[00:43:57.699 --> 00:44:00.821]  I'm not always wearing this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:00.941 --> 00:44:16.190]  I dress like this to politically get messages out to folks that aren't awake, to spur debates, but to also meet like-minded people who are out there feeling like they're alone and don't know how many of us there are.
[00:44:16.831 --> 00:44:26.357]  It's like Martin Luther King said, it's all of us of one human race who all have incredible skills and gifts that God gave us that we bring together in the human family.
[00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:28.118]  You do incredible things.
[00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:35.225]  A few months ago, I saw media demonizing folks that put up signs at universities that said, all lives matter.
[00:44:36.005 --> 00:44:38.528]  Then they demonized people that said, it's okay to be white.
[00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:46.885]  These are universities where they're saying it's inherently evil and an abomination and satanic to be white.
[00:44:47.346 --> 00:44:48.607]  Right outside Austin, Texas.
[00:44:49.007 --> 00:44:50.328]  Texas State University says that.
[00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:56.873]  Most major universities are directing this to create racial division in this country and it's sickening.
[00:44:57.514 --> 00:44:59.475]  That's why I have designed with our crew
[00:45:00.436 --> 00:45:11.718]  Several new limited edition t-shirts that expose this evil and fight true institutional leftist based racial division and classical race war designs.
[00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:16.275]  Yeah, if you're just talking about how you're white or how you're black, it's okay.
[00:45:16.695 --> 00:45:17.896]  That's fine to be proud of yourself.
[00:45:18.276 --> 00:45:21.478]  But isn't it really great to realize we all got red blood?
[00:45:21.498 --> 00:45:23.059]  That's why the shirt is in red.
[00:45:23.439 --> 00:45:31.525]  Out here in space together, the dark blue of the night sky, but all of our red blood together ties us together and that's what makes us great.
[00:45:31.785 --> 00:45:34.267]  The globalists are creating a fake debate to turn us against each other.
[00:45:34.587 --> 00:45:36.848]  Let's come together and say all lives matter.
[00:45:37.389 --> 00:45:41.772]  The fact is it's not just okay, it's great to be human.
[00:45:42.732 --> 00:45:44.452]  Let me show you a few of the other designs we've got.
[00:45:44.933 --> 00:45:46.873]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:49.694]  They help spread the word, and they help support the broadcast.
[00:45:49.954 --> 00:45:50.694]  A total win-win.
[00:45:51.314 --> 00:45:52.734]  This shirt is white.
[00:45:53.455 --> 00:45:53.795]  Whoa!
[00:45:54.535 --> 00:45:59.456]  And you've got major universities, major publications like BuzzFeed saying, is milk racist?
[00:45:59.896 --> 00:46:00.676]  Because it's white.
[00:46:01.296 --> 00:46:08.078]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a white shirt that says it's okay to be white, okay to be black, okay to be brown, but it's great.
[00:46:08.638 --> 00:46:09.178]  To be human.
[00:46:24.508 --> 00:46:29.129]  To literally take minorities and turn them into the equivalent of Brown Ku Klux Klan.
[00:46:29.469 --> 00:46:32.870]  This shirt is amazing, it's iconic, and it's limited edition.
[00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:40.631]  They're all available at InfoWarsStore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:46:40.911 --> 00:46:54.174]  And despite the fact that all these shirts are super high quality and are destined to be best sellers, through Christmas, we're offering 25% off at InfoWarsStore.com on these limited edition shirts.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:13.603]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:18.024 --> 00:47:24.566]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:37.523]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, beaming out to radio and TV stations all across the United States, and blasting out in the face of massive headwind and censorship.
[00:47:37.563 --> 00:47:51.608]  But winning, like salmon swimming upstream and winning, we are breaking through the electronic Berlin Wall of Google, Facebook, Twitter, you name it, as the president moves to break up those monopolies in year two.
[00:47:52.628 --> 00:47:56.870]  We are striking back, so be part of coming in for the big win, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:58.524 --> 00:48:16.384]  We have a very clear picture now of Andrew McCabe, deputy director, acting director, after Comey was fired, who played the part of a friend of the president, of someone that cared about him, that thought the Russiagate was totally fake, that everything was going to be fine.
[00:48:17.325 --> 00:48:36.577]  We now know from Rince Priebus, who has been interviewed for a book, and I don't just believe Priebus, I have this from all the other sources, that McCabe was, along with Bannon of course, a double dealer, but nothing compared to McCabe, the main leaker in the meetings with the president on Russiagate.
[00:48:37.578 --> 00:48:40.560]  Then going out and lying about what even happened in the meetings.
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.983]  Remember, Comey lied and said he didn't give the press the memo.
[00:48:44.663 --> 00:48:47.105]  His memo about meeting with the President, but he did.
[00:48:47.185 --> 00:48:48.206]  That's lying to Congress.
[00:48:49.246 --> 00:48:54.190]  So the Federalist reports, a new book, McCabe initiated White House meeting that led to leak.
[00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.752]  These were meetings about stopping leaks.
[00:48:57.992 --> 00:49:01.455]  So imagine, that's why the President said, okay, I nominate Andrew McCabe.
[00:49:03.632 --> 00:49:05.814]  Because he knows I'm a good guy.
[00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:06.935]  He knows this is all bull.
[00:49:07.315 --> 00:49:11.259]  He tells me he's aware there's a cabal inside the Justice Department and FBI.
[00:49:11.299 --> 00:49:12.460]  That's all in the new book.
[00:49:12.881 --> 00:49:13.421]  There's McCabe.
[00:49:13.461 --> 00:49:14.062]  Sure, there is.
[00:49:14.082 --> 00:49:14.482]  You're right.
[00:49:14.502 --> 00:49:15.263]  We're gonna stop him.
[00:49:15.843 --> 00:49:16.824]  And this is the best part?
[00:49:17.485 --> 00:49:18.906]  McCabe ran it!
[00:49:20.808 --> 00:49:21.889]  Can you imagine?
[00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:29.296]  That's like Hitler cuts his mustache off, you know, dyes his hair blonde or something, and he's like in there with a
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:38.065]  I guess General Eisenhower going, sir, we're going to help you defeat the Nazis inside the command base there in London.
[00:49:38.625 --> 00:49:39.966]  And Churchill comes in on his cane.
[00:49:40.607 --> 00:49:40.887]  Really?
[00:49:41.087 --> 00:49:41.727]  He's like, yes.
[00:49:42.268 --> 00:49:42.848]  What's your name?
[00:49:43.068 --> 00:49:44.449]  My name is Bob Jones.
[00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.771]  Sure have a German accent.
[00:49:46.971 --> 00:49:48.252]  Oh, no, you're being paranoid.
[00:49:48.272 --> 00:49:49.853]  You kind of look like Hitler.
[00:49:49.933 --> 00:49:50.974]  Oh, that's even crazier.
[00:49:52.415 --> 00:49:53.176]  Imagine.
[00:49:55.417 --> 00:49:59.180]  That's like Lex Luthor inside Superman's base telling him he's Lois Lane.
[00:50:00.467 --> 00:50:08.891]  I mean, you've got McCabe, who in the memos, in the documents, in the text messages, is running the whole operation for Comey under him.
[00:50:08.931 --> 00:50:09.651]  Of course he is!
[00:50:10.191 --> 00:50:18.575]  He's a protege of Mueller and Comey, and a minion of the Clintons, and his wife got a half million dollars directly just from Hillary!
[00:50:20.535 --> 00:50:20.936]  Boom!
[00:50:21.376 --> 00:50:23.977]  Didn't even spend it on her campaign reportedly, just kept it!
[00:50:24.237 --> 00:50:26.418]  That's another subject for criminal investigation.
[00:50:27.594 --> 00:50:34.940]  So, after he got caught, Comey admitted to leaking because he wanted to be the one that came out on, so he'd already lied.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.761]  That way it was like he was setting the record straight.
[00:50:37.782 --> 00:50:40.063]  That's why they say truth's stranger than fiction right now.
[00:50:41.324 --> 00:50:49.811]  Because, I'm gonna say this again, Priebus has now come out, he's being interviewed for a book, well we can read through it here for you in a moment, Howard Kurtz's new book.
[00:50:51.249 --> 00:50:52.530]  On just the press in general.
[00:50:53.071 --> 00:50:54.732]  And it confirms what we already knew.
[00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:56.454]  Imagine how mad Trump must be.
[00:50:56.834 --> 00:51:01.079]  He's in meetings almost every couple days with the head of the FBI.
[00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:03.361]  McCabe.
[00:51:05.467 --> 00:51:10.049]  And the guy is there lying to him, to his face, while he runs it.
[00:51:10.589 --> 00:51:11.610]  And I already said that three times.
[00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:12.630]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:24.035]  McCabe ran the criminal conspiracy, and it is criminal, we've got the memos, we've got the documents, it's totally illegal, to defraud the voters of America in our election, major civil rights violation.
[00:51:24.315 --> 00:51:29.257]  You've got all the fraudulent documents they were paying for, wiring money to pay for it, that's wire fraud.
[00:51:30.077 --> 00:51:37.140]  Lying to Congress, lying to the President, lying under oath, Mueller, Comey, McCabe, all of them!
[00:51:39.301 --> 00:51:41.402]  And again, they go, oh, you're besmirching the FBI.
[00:51:41.422 --> 00:51:44.083]  Look, the FBI's had its issues, okay, but...
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:50.043]  Obviously you're local, rank and file, traditionally, and I've known some of them are out doing real jobs and working hard.
[00:51:50.724 --> 00:51:53.126]  But this, this is what's destroying the FBI.
[00:51:53.406 --> 00:51:55.767]  These people are a criminal group that got control.
[00:51:55.988 --> 00:52:00.051]  It happens in companies, it happens in corporations, it happens in families, it happens.
[00:52:00.891 --> 00:52:03.453]  And bad people have gotten control.
[00:52:03.494 --> 00:52:04.394]  They were so arrogant.
[00:52:04.635 --> 00:52:05.555]  They thought she'd win.
[00:52:05.896 --> 00:52:08.158]  Once Trump won, they'd already committed so many crimes.
[00:52:08.438 --> 00:52:09.699]  They were cornered rats.
[00:52:09.819 --> 00:52:10.680]  They were committed.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:18.667]  They couldn't do anything anymore but try desperately with Hollywood and with the media to just bring this president down.
[00:52:20.068 --> 00:52:25.733]  But now, ladies and gentlemen, we are a year and seven, eight days into
[00:52:27.455 --> 00:52:30.337]  The recovery, because the globalists, again, had us held underwater.
[00:52:30.797 --> 00:52:31.998]  Trump just pulled them off of us.
[00:52:32.038 --> 00:52:33.559]  We're like, man, this is magic!
[00:52:33.719 --> 00:52:35.200]  And you're like, listen, I just got them off you.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.440]  Come on, more are coming.
[00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:36.921]  We got to fight.
[00:52:37.261 --> 00:52:38.121]  That's where we're at right now.
[00:52:38.842 --> 00:52:42.884]  Trump and the American people waking up, we just got the bully off of us.
[00:52:43.224 --> 00:52:43.905]  But we're bloody.
[00:52:43.925 --> 00:52:46.346]  We're kind of stumbling around, but so is the bully.
[00:52:46.666 --> 00:52:49.868]  It's time to attack, ladies and gentlemen, or they could win still.
[00:52:50.409 --> 00:52:52.030]  And that's why they're fighting so hard, man.
[00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:53.611]  They're putting their full power in.
[00:52:54.710 --> 00:53:01.192]  And the average conservative or libertarian is kind of like, oh, we beat them, they're a bunch of idiots, look at the NFL, look at the Grammys, look at the Oscars, what a bunch of morons.
[00:53:01.852 --> 00:53:04.172]  Those are just the camp followers and the PR people.
[00:53:04.572 --> 00:53:19.656]  Behind it are very serious people like Phil Mudd, who to signal strength to the flagging criminal networks, and stay behind networks, goes on TV the same week as the former CIA director and the former director of national intelligence, and they say,
[00:53:20.868 --> 00:53:25.634]  The president will be gone in two months, extra-judicially, we're not talking impeachment.
[00:53:27.756 --> 00:53:30.880]  And then, well, Blitzer says, you mean not impeachment?
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.360]  Not, well, how?
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.241]  And they go, you'll see.
[00:53:32.602 --> 00:53:33.843]  And Blitzer gets scared.
[00:53:34.384 --> 00:53:38.329]  And then two days later, Mudd goes on TV and says, we're gonna kill him!
[00:53:39.793 --> 00:53:46.999]  That was a telegraph to their criminal network that was scared already, already being counter-surveilled, already being caught, we now know, six months ago.
[00:53:47.419 --> 00:53:51.203]  And they're like, in the text messages, this isn't gonna work, Strock's telling his superiors.
[00:53:51.403 --> 00:53:52.283]  We gotta stop!
[00:53:53.284 --> 00:53:54.125]  There's nothing here!
[00:53:54.585 --> 00:53:55.446]  They're on to us!
[00:53:55.846 --> 00:53:56.727]  Keep going!
[00:53:57.408 --> 00:53:58.168]  Full power!
[00:53:58.329 --> 00:53:59.089]  Ramming speed!
[00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.991]  That's what happened.
[00:54:02.554 --> 00:54:04.135]  Think about the magnitude of that.
[00:54:04.155 --> 00:54:07.057]  Because these texts are coming out, and a bunch more are coming out this week.
[00:54:07.318 --> 00:54:08.759]  They're going to vote to release it today.
[00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:09.920]  Then it goes to the President.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.322]  A couple days, he's going to release it.
[00:54:12.422 --> 00:54:19.667]  And this is the time, just like they had the former Deputy National Security Agency, you know, Michael Hastings' wife.
[00:54:20.688 --> 00:54:22.269]  She only shows up at special times.
[00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:26.853]  She showed up last week and said, if you release this memo, you're going to cause a massacre.
[00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:31.442]  And then suddenly other shows said, a massacre, a massacre, a massacre.
[00:54:31.763 --> 00:54:32.424]  And they go, what do you mean?
[00:54:32.564 --> 00:54:34.026]  Oh, Congress might get blown up.
[00:54:35.227 --> 00:54:37.490]  So now they're from saying, we're strong.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:40.881]  We'll kill the president on TV as a signal.
[00:54:41.021 --> 00:54:43.903]  Well, gosh, golly, they're on TV saying they're going to kill him.
[00:54:44.323 --> 00:54:46.104]  Phil Mudd, our boss, says they're going to kill him.
[00:54:46.144 --> 00:54:46.984]  Mueller's main guy.
[00:54:47.004 --> 00:54:48.065]  That's Mueller.
[00:54:48.105 --> 00:54:50.746]  Mueller just signaled we're going to kill the president.
[00:54:50.966 --> 00:54:51.667]  So we're OK.
[00:54:51.707 --> 00:54:52.487]  They're all in their meetings.
[00:54:52.687 --> 00:54:53.227]  Are you sure?
[00:54:53.248 --> 00:54:54.208]  They're going to kill him.
[00:54:54.448 --> 00:54:56.569]  We're going to get flushed when we do this.
[00:54:56.749 --> 00:54:57.930]  This is crazy.
[00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.271]  I don't want to be part of this.
[00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:01.672]  And they ran to Congress.
[00:55:02.452 --> 00:55:03.313]  And I can tell you that.
[00:55:04.033 --> 00:55:09.014]  Because it's not just informants, it's FBI agents who were involved in it.
[00:55:10.171 --> 00:55:11.252]  Because they're not stupid.
[00:55:11.672 --> 00:55:22.220]  They know even if they overthrew Trump and could arrest all of us and brought in martial law, they're gonna kill, the globalists are gonna kill every single traitor like Ernst Röhm who helped take over.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.901]  Neither the Long Knives.
[00:55:24.221 --> 00:55:29.745]  There it is, MSNBC analyst claims conspiracies about FBI text messages could lead to violence.
[00:55:30.006 --> 00:55:31.887]  There's gonna be consequences, she wanna say.
[00:55:32.107 --> 00:55:34.149]  There's gonna be a massacre!
[00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.071]  Well, you know, Saudi Arabia,
[00:55:38.223 --> 00:55:40.604]  Told Trump, if you don't back off, you're going to have terror attacks.
[00:55:40.784 --> 00:55:47.447]  And Trump didn't back off, and they pulled off Vegas, and then about 5,000 people got hung up by their feet a couple weeks later.
[00:55:48.087 --> 00:55:55.470]  So Trump went and showed up in their face and said, we're going to basically bring you down just like that.
[00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:55.990]  Roll over.
[00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:56.871]  And they rolled over.
[00:55:57.791 --> 00:55:59.072]  These people are all arrested.
[00:55:59.352 --> 00:56:01.613]  That's what's really going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:01.913 --> 00:56:07.095]  We are kicking their big, fat, globalist, wart-covered butts up and down the street.
[00:56:08.339 --> 00:56:12.601]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but I told you globalists, you want to fight.
[00:56:14.582 --> 00:56:16.123]  You better believe you got one.
[00:56:16.303 --> 00:56:17.284]  That's the whole thing about this.
[00:56:17.304 --> 00:56:17.824]  Don't you get it?
[00:56:18.245 --> 00:56:19.225]  I don't want your fame.
[00:56:19.245 --> 00:56:20.386]  I don't want your stupid power.
[00:56:20.706 --> 00:56:23.928]  I want to see pedophile scum like you.
[00:56:25.322 --> 00:56:25.582]  Pay!
[00:56:26.283 --> 00:56:37.668]  I want to see you globalist scumbags that want to destroy the West and hate bitter clingers and hate Christians, no matter what color they are, and foam at the mouth wanting to abort any black babies you can get your hands on.
[00:56:38.088 --> 00:56:46.112]  I want you devil-worshipping jokes to know, in this universe, in this world, there's what you call a two-way street, Jack.
[00:56:46.713 --> 00:56:48.174]  And what comes around, goes around.
[00:56:48.494 --> 00:56:50.615]  And so, this is your karmic enforcement.
[00:56:51.656 --> 00:56:53.339]  You hate us because you hate yourself.
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.764]  You're sacks of garbage and you're going down.
[00:56:56.225 --> 00:56:57.608]  And all I can say to the listeners is this.
[00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:00.394]  The articles, the videos, the material.
[00:57:01.405 --> 00:57:29.571]  Infowars.com, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, those articles, those videos, those links, it is so critical now, more than ever, in the face of the bullying, and the intimidation, and the bots, and all of it, to jam these articles down people's throats, and to jam these videos out there, and to jam these video feeds out, and say this is the number one show under attack for a reason, because this guy knows who the enemy is, and he's there doing the opposite of demoralizing people,
[00:57:30.291 --> 00:57:34.137]  I'm here firing everybody up to know the second American Revolution's on.
[00:57:34.397 --> 00:57:41.087]  We're starting to win, but we need your help, so get in here right now in the InfoWar, and let's make sure we get this thing done.

[00:58:46.218 --> 00:58:50.081]  Fuel your body with Carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:58.047]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestion process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[00:58:58.747 --> 00:59:03.451]  They also help prevent discomfort from indigestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[00:59:04.051 --> 00:59:05.952]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[00:59:06.593 --> 00:59:10.015]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[00:59:10.816 --> 00:59:13.278]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[00:59:13.962 --> 00:59:20.605]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now, while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high-meat diets.
[00:59:21.206 --> 00:59:28.449]  Just one pill with every high-protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:35.953]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates, so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[00:59:36.533 --> 00:59:37.614]  Don't let a meal go to waste.
[00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:39.795]  Use Carnivore by InfoWars Life.

[00:59:49.382 --> 00:59:53.046]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:07.515 --> 01:00:10.918]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:23.811]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:24.011 --> 01:00:28.696]  People ask why I get so excited.
[01:00:29.943 --> 01:00:30.683]  Well, let me tell you.
[01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.504]  I get excited because I love living in the real world.
[01:00:34.245 --> 01:00:35.125]  And every day is a fight.
[01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:36.685]  And every day is a battle.
[01:00:37.506 --> 01:00:38.986]  And every day is a feast.
[01:00:39.827 --> 01:00:40.187]  Victory.
[01:00:40.727 --> 01:00:42.247]  Even when I lose, I take action.
[01:00:42.908 --> 01:00:46.589]  So we have a very special congressman joining us coming up in the third hour.
[01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:47.669]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.590]  Ahead of the vote coming up today.
[01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:51.211]  And then we have
[01:00:52.151 --> 01:00:56.132]  Some other special news is going to be joining us coming up.
[01:00:56.172 --> 01:01:00.694]  So look for some surprises here today in the transmission.
[01:01:01.874 --> 01:01:08.556]  But what I'd like to do in this hour is get your take on where the global is going to go next.
[01:01:11.277 --> 01:01:15.778]  You just saw that a new book's coming out with interviews with people inside the White House.
[01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:19.319]  Media Madness by Howard Kurtz.
[01:01:21.408 --> 01:01:32.219]  Where McCabe was assuring the president that he was investigating the fake dossier and the fraud and the leaks, and then he was the main leaker.
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.741]  And it's now confirmed.
[01:01:35.802 --> 01:01:39.947]  Well, of course, Comey said he wasn't leaking, and then had to admit he was leaking.
[01:01:40.027 --> 01:01:44.972]  It's just incredible, the bravado, but it's not bravado now.
[01:01:46.173 --> 01:01:55.738]  They were full of hubris and arrogance and the rest of it previously, and delusions of grandeur, as if they actually created this country when they just hijacked it.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:07.464]  And now, they're panicking because they are cornered rodents, and nothing they do can turn it around anymore.
[01:02:08.465 --> 01:02:12.047]  And so, the House of Cards is imploding, and you can see the signs now every day.
[01:02:12.067 --> 01:02:14.388]  I want to play that
[01:02:15.942 --> 01:02:16.503]  Grammy clip.
[01:02:34.022 --> 01:02:39.387]  That I did a screenshot just of her evil face, but then forgot to send you the full shot.
[01:02:39.727 --> 01:02:41.068]  But I think I've got it in my phone.
[01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:44.611]  So I may have to like send it to one of you guys, because I did screenshot it.
[01:02:44.651 --> 01:02:45.652]  No, no, it's not that one.
[01:02:46.073 --> 01:02:47.173]  It's even more hideous.
[01:02:47.234 --> 01:02:48.915]  It's not just that she looks like a demon witch.
[01:02:50.236 --> 01:02:54.640]  No makeup needed, you know, to be in the new Harry Potter movie or whatever.
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.004]  Yeah, that's a screenshot up close of her face, but it's her with this reported predator.
[01:03:00.523 --> 01:03:06.707]  And then it's coming out a bunch of other reported predators, including people that were touching on kids, that she's been protecting.
[01:03:06.767 --> 01:03:13.831]  I mean, she flies around on the Lolita Express with a convicted pedophile, and her husband has settled all these cases.
[01:03:14.532 --> 01:03:20.676]  And she hangs out with Weinstein on the same airplane, and Kevin Spacey on the same airplane.
[01:03:21.076 --> 01:03:27.100]  And then you've got all the spirit cooking, and John Podesta and his brother, they divert off into Pizzagate all day.
[01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:49.968]  Use the fact that I explained Pizzagate was a diversion to claim that I retracted it, when I was the one saying it's a diversion from the real stuff like Podesta's brother, Tony Podesta, in the Washington Post in 2007, back when they thought they were invincible, saying, I have a basement where I screen dangerous art.
[01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:53.851]  And it's like this.
[01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:56.013]  And then he showed paintings.
[01:03:56.173 --> 01:03:57.154]  I don't want to show them ourselves.
[01:03:58.374 --> 01:04:05.177]  Of little naked toddler's butts that an adult man had beaten red with a paddle.
[01:04:08.299 --> 01:04:10.020]  I screen dangerous art.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.281]  That's the photo, you found it.
[01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:14.782]  Yeah, he said, I screen dangerous art.
[01:04:15.843 --> 01:04:18.384]  That's her and this guy, she was defending a separate issue with women.
[01:04:19.124 --> 01:04:25.927]  I screen devious art, or dangerous art, and it's like this, and it's images of bound children, paddled, naked toddlers.
[01:04:26.588 --> 01:04:26.808]  I mean,
[01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:38.416]  It's like, whoa, if you tried to print these photos at the Eckerds or the Walgreens, they'd call the police on you, rightfully so.
[01:04:38.896 --> 01:04:50.000]  I mean, if I was working at Eckerds or Walgreens and somebody's printing photos off and it's paddled toddlers with their hands bound, I'd be like, uh, police department, I don't know if this is pedophilia, but it sure as hell looks like it.
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:52.361]  You want to drop by and get this information?
[01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:54.962]  But oh, it's the Podestas, so it's okay.
[01:04:57.067 --> 01:04:59.008]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:04:59.028 --> 01:04:59.468]  Go ahead.
[01:04:59.768 --> 01:05:01.948]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:05:01.968 --> 01:05:05.009]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:06.950]  It just gets old, man.
[01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:08.970]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:05:09.671 --> 01:05:11.771]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:15.992]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:18.433]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:21.635]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:05:21.995 --> 01:05:23.055]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:05:23.356 --> 01:05:24.236]  Us being shut down?
[01:05:24.456 --> 01:05:25.517]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:05:25.957 --> 01:05:26.978]  You know what, Alex?
[01:05:27.018 --> 01:05:28.099]  Put him on pause again.
[01:05:28.119 --> 01:05:28.959]  Hey, Frank!
[01:05:29.239 --> 01:05:34.583]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:05:34.883 --> 01:05:39.165]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:05:39.406 --> 01:05:42.287]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:42.928]  You understand?
[01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:44.289]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.769]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:51.680]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:53.063]  Do you understand?
[01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.325]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:54.345 --> 01:05:56.189]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:06:04.497 --> 01:06:06.599]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:08.881 --> 01:06:14.566]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:15.967 --> 01:06:20.652]  Well I told you two weeks ago and I told you again last week and I'm not bragging
[01:06:22.856 --> 01:06:26.217]  We have to tell you when we've been right when people try to spin it and say we've been lying.
[01:06:26.617 --> 01:06:27.577]  Now, I never lie.
[01:06:28.577 --> 01:06:30.678]  But I do get things wrong sometimes.
[01:06:31.678 --> 01:06:35.619]  And all the time I correct myself, it's usually some date or some name I get wrong.
[01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:36.900]  Because I go teleprompter free.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:49.703]  But, I mean, I'm talking to members of Congress, I'm talking to their aides, I'm talking to media people high up in Fox News, and high up in other channels I'm not going to name because it would be too specific if I did.
[01:06:51.581 --> 01:06:52.682]  I'll just stop right there.
[01:06:53.422 --> 01:06:55.663]  And they obviously want to know what's in that memo.
[01:06:56.303 --> 01:06:59.685]  And I was told, yes Alex, yes.
[01:07:00.966 --> 01:07:03.407]  This was one of the other conversations I had at Others Weeks before.
[01:07:04.332 --> 01:07:21.945]  But I had a conversation last week on Monday when we released, because it was already public but it got no attention, the redacted, declassified version of the 99-page report by the FISA Court about criminal activities they were asked to engage in that they rebutted three times in the document.
[01:07:23.045 --> 01:07:24.306]  And they say this is illegal.
[01:07:25.888 --> 01:07:31.151]  But what's blacked out is the names of who did it, what they told them to do, what their arguments were.
[01:07:31.732 --> 01:07:33.153]  That is the roadmap
[01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:37.334]  For all the other documents they've got, and I was told.
[01:07:38.456 --> 01:07:47.111]  We're just calling it the secret FISA memo because it's all about FISA and how illegal made-up information was used to obtain this, Alex.
[01:07:49.076 --> 01:07:55.963]  And then it goes into how the Justice Department with the FBI, through Obama, linked up on the other side with the Democratic Party and Hillary.
[01:07:56.463 --> 01:08:00.207]  And then below that, how the mainstream media went along with it.
[01:08:00.327 --> 01:08:03.951]  And Epoch Times reverse engineered this as well a week ago.
[01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:05.933]  Here's that graphic I've been showing so much.
[01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:09.116]  Over on the left, you've got Hillary and the Democratic Party and their operatives.
[01:08:09.636 --> 01:08:12.439]  Then you've got the Justice Department and the FBI and Comey.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:20.226]  You've got Obama and all the rest of them over here putting the orders on through Loretta Lynch and others to end up spying on Flynn and everybody else.
[01:08:20.246 --> 01:08:22.008]  And then you've got that flowing downwards.
[01:08:22.028 --> 01:08:27.092]  You've got the media then all involved in regurgitating and making it all look legitimate.
[01:08:28.633 --> 01:08:29.574]  And so that's what I was told.
[01:08:29.674 --> 01:08:31.416]  Yes, Alex, no, it's not fake news.
[01:08:31.836 --> 01:08:33.497]  Jack Posobiec also talked to a congressman.
[01:08:33.718 --> 01:08:35.099]  They said, no, that is part of it.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.783]  That memo, the excise parts, is the core of it.
[01:08:41.223 --> 01:08:51.528]  But it's the court because it shows that the court thought it was illegal three times and rebutted it until finally it came down from the president, you're going to do this.
[01:08:53.969 --> 01:08:54.930]  Yes sir, Mr. President.
[01:08:55.834 --> 01:08:58.376]  That's why they say this is going to embarrass the President so much.
[01:08:58.416 --> 01:09:00.538]  So, we've told you what's in the memo.
[01:09:01.099 --> 01:09:10.807]  The media plays games and, you know, Jones claims, I mean, just two weeks ago they were saying there isn't a memo or that Nunes had invented his smoking gun.
[01:09:10.847 --> 01:09:11.387]  That's what they do.
[01:09:11.588 --> 01:09:12.729]  They first say it doesn't exist.
[01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:15.111]  Then they go, oh, Jones got it wrong.
[01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:23.338]  He said he released all the secret memo when he released another secret FISA memorandum, which means memo.
[01:09:25.523 --> 01:09:27.723]  When William Benny said, hey, I got a call.
[01:09:27.763 --> 01:09:28.384]  This has been out.
[01:09:28.844 --> 01:09:30.104]  No one's giving it any attention.
[01:09:30.744 --> 01:09:31.744]  And I said, who gave me the call?
[01:09:31.764 --> 01:09:32.284]  This is off air.
[01:09:32.324 --> 01:09:36.005]  And he said, Alex, you know, I'm obviously sort of laughing.
[01:09:36.025 --> 01:09:39.506]  He goes, yeah, no, people, people want us to talk about this today.
[01:09:40.186 --> 01:09:43.727]  And he's the former director of operations for the NSA.
[01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:44.847]  You know, the guy that actually runs it.
[01:09:45.187 --> 01:09:49.188]  You've got a political head, but number two at the NSA, famous guy.
[01:09:50.771 --> 01:09:55.355]  Top analyst, you name it, and he's saying, no, this is what they're talking about.
[01:09:55.735 --> 01:09:59.979]  The fact that the Director of National Intelligence released this shows that Trump wants this out.
[01:10:00.039 --> 01:10:02.341]  It's a very positive sign that Trump is against this.
[01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:06.805]  Oh, what does the former head of operations of the NSA know?
[01:10:08.066 --> 01:10:12.790]  Well, I don't normally play a clip twice, but I want to play at least the intro.
[01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:15.533]  I played the whole thing earlier of Trey Gowdy with Mr. Wallace.
[01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:23.839]  Last night on Fox News, where he says exactly what I just said.
[01:10:24.199 --> 01:10:26.800]  The media spun it that I said I released all of it.
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:42.607]  No, I said I released the redacted version of the secret memo that they're using as a roadmap for the proof of perjury and the collusion, not by the Russians, but by the Democratic Party and the deep state to try to stop the President.
[01:10:43.507 --> 01:10:45.208]  So let's go ahead and go to the intro of Gowdy.
[01:10:46.507 --> 01:10:53.814]  As I discussed with Mark Short, the Washington Post reports today that the President wants to have the memo released.
[01:10:54.654 --> 01:10:55.415]  Do you agree with that?
[01:10:57.877 --> 01:10:58.197]  I do.
[01:10:58.297 --> 01:10:59.819]  I'm sorry that we're to this point.
[01:11:00.519 --> 01:11:11.209]  This memo is nothing but the distilling, the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the Department and the Bureau.
[01:11:12.054 --> 01:11:15.158]  I said that word for word last Monday.
[01:11:16.459 --> 01:11:21.145]  Have some of the crew find that, because I talked about it earlier in the show, the first hour.
[01:11:22.372 --> 01:11:24.713]  And then they're like, hey, go ahead and cover this.
[01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:27.655]  And then I was told, no, this is the memo.
[01:11:27.915 --> 01:11:28.796]  It's not the redacted part.
[01:11:28.816 --> 01:11:30.677]  So I went with that, pointing that out.
[01:11:30.897 --> 01:11:32.798]  But I said, word for word, this is a boil down.
[01:11:33.059 --> 01:11:35.560]  This is a roadmap of thousands of pages of documents.
[01:11:36.281 --> 01:11:41.924]  But the declassified portion of the memo is the code key to prove how it all ties together.
[01:11:42.204 --> 01:11:46.187]  And the chain of them testifying to the court under oath
[01:11:46.747 --> 01:11:48.449]  And then perjuring themselves to Congress.
[01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:51.233]  So they lied to the FISA Court or they lied to Congress.
[01:11:51.793 --> 01:11:53.255]  This is what I was told by a congressman.
[01:11:53.656 --> 01:11:54.497]  Not by Trey Gowdy.
[01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:58.581]  But I personally was told this two weeks ago and again a week ago.
[01:11:59.963 --> 01:12:01.104]  From our congressional sources.
[01:12:01.204 --> 01:12:02.805]  And again, I'm told the truth.
[01:12:03.106 --> 01:12:06.548]  Doesn't mean I absolutely navigated the way to describe this perfectly.
[01:12:06.909 --> 01:12:11.793]  Gowdy, back this up again, is trying to explain this to people.
[01:12:12.213 --> 01:12:13.274]  It's complex.
[01:12:14.014 --> 01:12:25.644]  And notice it's word for word what I said, not because I talked to Gowdy, not because there's talking points, but because that's what we're trying to describe is a big, giant, complex process and the establishment is hiding behind it.
[01:12:25.664 --> 01:12:28.206]  But let's put our article up from last week so people can
[01:12:29.306 --> 01:12:31.668]  See it, go read the document for yourselves.
[01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:39.933]  But I gotta tell you, it's a victory for mainstream media that they could just say, I put a hoax out last week, and even have conservatives jump on board.
[01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:42.003]  Exclusive!
[01:12:42.023 --> 01:12:44.065]  InfoWars released a secret FISA memo.
[01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:47.449]  Here's the reported memo leaked to InfoWars.
[01:12:47.469 --> 01:12:50.192]  And then we go on to explain the facts there and all the rest of it.
[01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.093]  There are excised parts.
[01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:53.956]  But it says, top secret, it was the secret memo.
[01:12:54.276 --> 01:12:56.038]  And we were the first to give it big attention.
[01:12:56.279 --> 01:12:59.562]  Weeks before, some of the guys, what, Michael Zimmerman had covered it on the show.
[01:13:00.558 --> 01:13:02.120]  When he hosted, uh, War Room.
[01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:05.386]  But that's an example of, I didn't, I wasn't watching then.
[01:13:05.746 --> 01:13:10.273]  Just like, just like, uh, the former head of the NSA Technical says, no, this has gotten no attention.
[01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.455]  People want this to have attention.
[01:13:11.856 --> 01:13:13.759]  Remember, he's being, he's advising the president now.
[01:13:14.986 --> 01:13:17.387]  So that's what's going on here, at the highest levels.
[01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:21.729]  So you just heard word for word what I said out of Trey Gowdy's mouth, because that's what this is.
[01:13:21.989 --> 01:13:23.730]  And they're voting today to release it.
[01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:24.950]  I believe they'll vote to release it.
[01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:31.153]  It's got to go before the president and the executive branch, because they're going to give deference to them on national security issues.
[01:13:31.513 --> 01:13:33.074]  Congress could just release this if they wanted to.
[01:13:33.454 --> 01:13:35.995]  But they're going to send it to the president, and the word is he's going to release it.
[01:13:36.935 --> 01:13:38.596]  Let's go ahead and go to the rest of it.
[01:13:39.974 --> 01:13:47.260]  As I discussed with Mark Short, the Washington Post reports today the President wants to have the memo released.
[01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:48.881]  Do you agree with that?
[01:13:51.323 --> 01:13:51.663]  I do.
[01:13:51.743 --> 01:13:53.265]  I'm sorry that we're to this point.
[01:13:53.985 --> 01:14:04.733]  This memo is nothing but the distilling, the reducing of thousands of pages of documents provided to us by the Department and the Bureau.
[01:14:04.793 --> 01:14:08.917]  So there's nothing in this memo that the Department is not already aware of.
[01:14:10.017 --> 01:14:29.044]  If you think your viewers want to know whether or not the dossier was used in court proceedings, whether or not it was vetted before it was used, whether or not it's ever been vetted, if you are interested in who paid for the dossier, if you're interested in Christopher Steele's relationship with Hillary Clinton and the Democrat National Committee, then yes, you'll want the memo to come out.
[01:14:29.405 --> 01:14:31.305]  If you're Adam Schiff, who is
[01:14:33.186 --> 01:14:36.549]  Consistently wrong, uh, when it comes to issues of disclosure.
[01:14:36.589 --> 01:14:39.010]  He didn't want us to find out any of this information, Chris.
[01:14:39.291 --> 01:14:41.312]  He- he fought- Oh, that's good.
[01:14:41.852 --> 01:14:43.394]  Full clips on Infowars.com.
[01:14:45.015 --> 01:14:45.996]  Newswars.com.
[01:14:46.456 --> 01:14:47.377]  And then he just goes through it.
[01:14:47.617 --> 01:14:52.160]  It's Obama, it's- it's- it's- it's Loretta Lynch, it's McCabe, it's- it's Comey.
[01:14:52.420 --> 01:14:53.201]  They're all busted.
[01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:55.823]  And you know, the left runs around every day going, BUSTED!
[01:14:55.863 --> 01:14:56.243]  BUSTED!
[01:14:56.603 --> 01:14:59.485]  Oh, they admit they're Russians, they're all going to prison, they're all gonna go to jail.
[01:15:00.046 --> 01:15:01.247]  That's hype and BS.
[01:15:04.636 --> 01:15:09.758]  When I get up here and I say they're busted, I've never seen something this crazy.
[01:15:10.158 --> 01:15:10.798]  This naked.
[01:15:11.098 --> 01:15:12.079]  This caught red-handed.
[01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:13.039]  And I'll explain again.
[01:15:13.059 --> 01:15:14.400]  I know you know this.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:15.460]  We gotta get the word out on this.
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.701]  They thought Hillary was getting in.
[01:15:18.061 --> 01:15:19.262]  They thought they were invincible.
[01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.042]  They thought they couldn't be stopped.
[01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:22.903]  They thought the sky was the limit.
[01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:38.010]  So they committed all these crazy crimes, then once they lose, they get even wilder, not out of hubris anymore, not out of chutzpah, not out of megalomania, but out of desperation, and that's why they're so dangerous.
[01:15:38.350 --> 01:15:45.931]  Then they send out black ops spokespersons, like Michael Hastings' wife, to say, if you release this, there's going to be a giant massacre.
[01:15:46.772 --> 01:15:48.412]  That's all code communication.
[01:15:49.898 --> 01:15:53.271]  And it gets pretty naked, you know, when Phil Mudd says we're gonna kill the president.
[01:15:53.693 --> 01:15:53.974]  I mean, that...
[01:15:57.771 --> 01:16:00.153]  Our latest product, by the way, is Immune Wall.
[01:16:00.913 --> 01:16:03.175]  It's very, very affordable at $29.95.
[01:16:03.595 --> 01:16:05.456]  It's 25% off out of the gates.
[01:16:05.997 --> 01:16:12.081]  And we set out with beta glucans, olive leaf, and a bunch of other key compounds that are absolutely documented.
[01:16:12.121 --> 01:16:23.348]  We can even make claims about what this does to bolster your immune system and make you healthier, especially if you're going to be traveling or you're under stress or it's in the winter months.
[01:16:23.908 --> 01:16:26.170]  This is something everybody should be taking.
[01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:27.491]  Wellmune is patented.
[01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:31.173]  And documented in all the hundreds of studies.
[01:16:32.113 --> 01:16:34.154]  And then you got the ancient stuff there as well.
[01:16:34.214 --> 01:16:38.876]  The organic olive leaf extract is what the Roman soldiers would take whenever they started getting sick.
[01:16:39.296 --> 01:16:42.718]  Just chopped full of all those key enzymes and vitamin C and so much more.
[01:16:42.738 --> 01:16:49.240]  Then it's got all the concentrated highest quality organic types of mushrooms that are documented for your body.
[01:16:49.281 --> 01:16:54.583]  And then concentrated citrus peel, orange peel, lemon peel, organic orange peel.
[01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:59.314]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not gonna sit here and hype this product up.
[01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:07.841]  So whether it's the sleep aid knockout you need, which is amazing, melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:17:08.181 --> 01:17:12.504]  And I said, I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much are you in that?
[01:17:13.125 --> 01:17:19.450]  They said on average about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:43.076]  And I said, so, I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you can actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and several other things, and I check the scientists, none of them interact badly, they're all from nature, they're all healthy, they all have good, you know, good clean records, and then you get a sleep unlike other systems.
[01:17:44.474 --> 01:17:50.620]  Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law Family Code.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.542]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:17:52.562 --> 01:17:54.423]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:17:54.984 --> 01:17:57.306]  You know, doesn't smoke marijuana, doesn't drink.
[01:17:57.326 --> 01:18:00.109]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:02.231]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:18:02.251 --> 01:18:04.273]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:18:05.481 --> 01:18:08.602]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:09.522]  This is insane.
[01:18:09.943 --> 01:18:10.883]  Wow, it's incredible.
[01:18:10.923 --> 01:18:12.964]  I've taken melatonin up by itself and it didn't help.
[01:18:13.124 --> 01:18:14.324]  Wow, this is incredible.
[01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:15.705]  And I said, yeah, I don't know.
[01:18:15.725 --> 01:18:20.706]  I just had the idea to mix everything known, you know, scientifically and in the wives' tales together to make you sleep.
[01:18:20.786 --> 01:18:21.727]  And, you know, it's powerful.
[01:18:22.387 --> 01:18:23.549]  And they're all game changers.
[01:18:23.569 --> 01:18:28.395]  You need to really go read the third-party reviews from Power Reviews and others that we have linked.
[01:18:29.015 --> 01:18:32.660]  Our average review on InfoWareStore.com, there's more than 40,000 reviews now, is 94%.
[01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:42.472]  They even had media investigations with BuzzFeed and people calling them going, we want to see it, it must be fake.
[01:18:42.492 --> 01:18:44.773]  They're like, no, it's really real.
[01:18:46.034 --> 01:18:49.876]  So they've had campaigns that people go on there and try to vote stuff down.
[01:18:49.916 --> 01:18:53.897]  I mean, they are just so angry where they test our stuff and test it and test it.
[01:18:53.957 --> 01:18:59.720]  California labs that has stuff nine times higher than EU that has the next highest standards.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:06.067]  I mean, basically, there's more lead in the air in California than you can, quote, put in a supplement or any other product, unless you call it a food product.
[01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:14.235]  What is it, 60-something of our products are all California standard, but if you've got something that's got, I don't know, 10, 15 ingredients in it, and it's also a large serving like Caveman?
[01:19:14.556 --> 01:19:17.178]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, any can of chicken noodle soup.
[01:19:17.839 --> 01:19:20.700]  Has probably five times the lead California says is allowed.
[01:19:20.820 --> 01:19:21.560]  It's just insane.
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.120]  And then we test and test and test more than anybody we know of because we know.
[01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:27.561]  Now we're under a microscope, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:19:28.101 --> 01:19:30.301]  But thank you for committing to get the great products.
[01:19:30.661 --> 01:19:32.201]  The books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:19:32.522 --> 01:19:35.182]  Because it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:19:35.202 --> 01:19:38.262]  We're not like, it's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films.
[01:19:38.883 --> 01:19:42.023]  And you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:45.144]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:19:45.484 --> 01:19:46.804]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:19:48.772 --> 01:19:51.073]  That's available at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:51.113 --> 01:19:52.793]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:20.692 --> 01:20:25.137]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:20:25.538 --> 01:20:28.501]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:40.962 --> 01:20:44.306]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back broadcasting worldwide.
[01:20:44.767 --> 01:20:55.780]  Coming up today, four o'clock central, that's five o'clock eastern, the House is set to vote to declassify the memorandum, the boil-down, the documentation.
[01:20:56.741 --> 01:21:08.230]  The roadmap that Nunes is calling the secret FISA memo, because it's based on secret sections of that memo and thousands of pages of other documents, according to the words of Trey Gowdy.
[01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:16.316]  And then the president, I would guess by Wednesday or Thursday, will release that information and will go on to the executive branch.
[01:21:16.936 --> 01:21:19.799]  I want to get your take on what you think they're going to try to do to stop that.
[01:21:20.359 --> 01:21:24.422]  We're going to open the phones up before the Congressman joins us in the next hour to get into this.
[01:21:25.182 --> 01:21:32.807]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:21:32.827 --> 01:21:35.069]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:21:35.089 --> 01:21:36.209]  877-789-A-L-E-X.
[01:21:36.570 --> 01:21:40.612]  We are taking your phone calls on the memo and all that it represents.
[01:21:41.213 --> 01:21:43.214]  Congress standing up against the deep state.
[01:21:44.035 --> 01:21:48.878]  Against rogue groups in the bureaucracy challenging the executive, the legislative, the judicial.
[01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:51.660]  It's a big deal.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:56.803]  And then we can also get into the leftist groups are calling for Taylor Swift to be boycotted.
[01:21:57.203 --> 01:22:00.265]  They say she's aggressively white because she is white.
[01:22:00.645 --> 01:22:01.906]  The media is saying she's bad.
[01:22:02.486 --> 01:22:03.507]  That's out of the Herald Sun.
[01:22:03.547 --> 01:22:06.269]  Taylor Swift has no fear of bullies of the left.
[01:22:07.196 --> 01:22:08.157]  We can get into all of that.
[01:22:08.557 --> 01:22:13.620]  She's been labeled aggressively white, linked to neo-Nazis, and accused of being a messenger of the disturbing new era.
[01:22:14.321 --> 01:22:25.168]  Last week she was criticized by BuzzFeed, run by George Soros, funded by Soros, for not taking part in the second annual Women's March to be led by Muslims, aka the world's largest post-election tantrum.
[01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:28.911]  So we'll talk about that as well.
[01:22:28.951 --> 01:22:34.455]  Meanwhile, unhinged Michael Moore assails Trump, unfit narcissist, sociopath, threat to humanity.
[01:22:35.981 --> 01:22:37.843]  Yeah, people like you are the threat to humanity, buddy.
[01:22:38.303 --> 01:22:41.006]  And meanwhile, though, people are really getting sick of Hillary Clinton.
[01:22:41.847 --> 01:22:54.099]  And I want to play this next clip, the full clip, just to give you the cringe-worthiness of the Grammys last night that had the lowest amount of viewers ever recorded.
[01:22:54.159 --> 01:22:55.521]  Grammy ratings fall.
[01:22:56.584 --> 01:23:02.646]  And then it goes on to break down that it's basically a crash and burn just like the NFL, just like Hollywood movie sales.
[01:23:03.066 --> 01:23:05.547]  People are sick of being beaten over the head.
[01:23:05.927 --> 01:23:09.109]  I personally want to go see a movie that's not political.
[01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:14.430]  I personally want to watch a ballgame sometimes, but I can't do it because it's so political.
[01:23:15.711 --> 01:23:16.831]  Liberal or conservative.
[01:23:17.532 --> 01:23:20.893]  Beating you over the head, beating you over the head, beating you over the head.
[01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.313]  The ads are propaganda.
[01:23:22.353 --> 01:23:24.094]  The statements are propaganda.
[01:23:26.189 --> 01:23:29.511]  And then you've got Hillary with this fiction book.
[01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:35.154]  It's kind of like a historical novel.
[01:23:35.734 --> 01:23:40.217]  It's posing as non-fiction, but it is fiction, but it mixes some truth in it.
[01:23:40.257 --> 01:23:41.157]  It's been totally discredited.
[01:23:41.177 --> 01:23:49.121]  I don't have to go back over that can of worms, that kettle of fish, that mess that is Mr. Hairwolf's book.
[01:23:50.042 --> 01:23:55.385]  But then they have these bumbling, babbling people at the Grammys.
[01:23:57.213 --> 01:24:03.835]  Who were part of the skit with Hillary, and I'm like, man, I was in middle school drama skits.
[01:24:05.075 --> 01:24:11.957]  I took drama once, I think in seventh grade, and then once, because one of my friends was in it, I think like when I was a sophomore.
[01:24:12.537 --> 01:24:14.437]  And I remember being part of those deals.
[01:24:14.477 --> 01:24:17.638]  I mean, we were better actors then than this is.
[01:24:18.769 --> 01:24:20.309]  Of course, the left will say, oh, shut up, Jones.
[01:24:20.329 --> 01:24:21.350]  What do you know about acting?
[01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:31.532]  Well, I don't act here on this broadcast, but I have been in some big movies and major roles and done a lot of big voiceovers for cartoons and video games in a previous incarnation.
[01:24:31.992 --> 01:24:33.593]  I quit doing it ten years ago.
[01:24:33.993 --> 01:24:41.675]  I decided that it's a distraction from battling the globalists, even though I was making more money on voiceovers than I even make here.
[01:24:42.055 --> 01:24:45.356]  In fact, that's the argument, is I should go do a bunch of voiceovers and stuff to fund the Infowar.
[01:24:45.836 --> 01:24:49.920]  But then, once they figure out who I was politically, I'd have to have a fake name.
[01:24:50.621 --> 01:24:56.107]  But you know how much they pay if you're in one of these movies and they read like two pages of lines in a movie?
[01:24:56.727 --> 01:24:58.049]  I can do any voice I want.
[01:25:00.111 --> 01:25:04.495]  I wish my own personal voice wasn't so grating and annoying, but I can do any voice I want to, basically.
[01:25:06.772 --> 01:25:07.492]  That's a whole other area.
[01:25:07.512 --> 01:25:11.174]  But the point is, I don't really bad untalented people when I see them.
[01:25:11.455 --> 01:25:15.197]  They may be okay lip syncers or, you know, for me, I don't know who these people are.
[01:25:15.217 --> 01:25:15.917]  I don't pay attention.
[01:25:16.337 --> 01:25:18.799]  I just know it's so cringeworthy.
[01:25:19.419 --> 01:25:21.220]  How could anyone watch any of this?
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:29.565]  And then I watched more clips of it, and it was just people worshipping Hillary and hating Trump all night and trying to block the recovery of our country.
[01:25:29.945 --> 01:25:33.547]  We're going to cover this, come back, go right to your phone calls on the big issues.
[01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:35.088]  But Hillary Clinton,
[01:25:36.008 --> 01:25:43.352]  Cardi B and more audition for Fire and Fury, and then Hillary reads out of this book.
[01:25:43.532 --> 01:25:43.952]  Here it is.
[01:25:47.254 --> 01:25:50.096]  Fire and Fury, spoken word auditions, take one.
[01:25:51.417 --> 01:25:52.857]  Trump won't read anything.
[01:25:53.378 --> 01:25:58.220]  He gets up halfway through meetings with world leaders because he is bored.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:58.641]  Hit pause.
[01:25:58.681 --> 01:25:59.541]  Cut!
[01:26:01.442 --> 01:26:04.524]  Said he interviewed everybody in the administration, didn't interview one cabinet member.
[01:26:05.615 --> 01:26:07.196]  Says the President won't read anything.
[01:26:07.756 --> 01:26:09.358]  I've had long conversations with the President.
[01:26:09.878 --> 01:26:12.660]  There wasn't one subject I raised or one news item.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:13.961]  Sir, let me tell you about this.
[01:26:16.602 --> 01:26:20.465]  Again, they'll say he goes to sleep at 6.30 at night because he goes to bed at 1 in the morning now.
[01:26:20.485 --> 01:26:21.766]  They've got him to go to bed a little bit earlier.
[01:26:22.346 --> 01:26:23.427]  And he gets up at 5 a.m.
[01:26:24.167 --> 01:26:26.309]  These people, again, it's all lies.
[01:26:26.349 --> 01:26:27.009]  We all know.
[01:26:27.269 --> 01:26:31.052]  So this lazy moron has turned the economy around and all this other stuff.
[01:26:31.512 --> 01:26:32.453]  What does it say about you?
[01:26:32.473 --> 01:26:35.275]  I mean, again, these people can hardly read off the book.
[01:26:36.616 --> 01:26:37.236]  Go back, sorry.
[01:26:37.836 --> 01:26:39.397]  Sorry, John.
[01:26:39.457 --> 01:26:39.877]  It's wonderful.
[01:26:39.897 --> 01:26:41.078]  It just feels a bit too smooth.
[01:26:41.418 --> 01:26:42.499]  I don't think it's going to work, though.
[01:26:42.799 --> 01:26:43.819]  Next!
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.801]  His comb-over, semi-colon.
[01:26:47.241 --> 01:26:47.801]  Pause the game.
[01:26:48.262 --> 01:26:54.005]  Cher looks like a rubber sex robot, or like a rubber sex doll.
[01:26:54.485 --> 01:26:56.146]  And what is she, like 75 years old?
[01:26:56.166 --> 01:27:00.488]  She's trying to look like she's 16 with some rubber face on, these narcissistic dirtbags.
[01:27:00.768 --> 01:27:02.029]  Let's go back to this rubber head.
[01:27:02.782 --> 01:27:05.002]  It was a product called Just For Men.
[01:27:05.623 --> 01:27:08.243]  The longer it was left on, the darker it got.
[01:27:08.543 --> 01:27:09.083]  Hey, pause again.
[01:27:09.943 --> 01:27:18.465]  You've got this lady that's wearing a rubber mask and is really the cryptkeeper underneath, telling us about somebody being bad dyeing their hair.
[01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:21.586]  And notice, he's not doing it anymore and it's all grayish.
[01:27:21.746 --> 01:27:22.386]  Looks a lot better.
[01:27:22.626 --> 01:27:23.586]  But the point is, so what?
[01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:24.426]  He's on TV!
[01:27:24.766 --> 01:27:26.407]  So he's bad because he dyed his hair?
[01:27:26.547 --> 01:27:28.187]  When you're a rubber head, go back to her!
[01:27:29.713 --> 01:27:32.534]  Resulted in Trump's orange blonde hair color.
[01:27:32.614 --> 01:27:32.954]  Cut!
[01:27:33.535 --> 01:27:36.096]  Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration.
[01:27:36.116 --> 01:27:38.337]  By the way, this is a convicted criminal admitting pimp.
[01:27:38.357 --> 01:27:40.378]  He started to get angry and hurt.
[01:27:40.458 --> 01:27:43.259]  That stars were determined to embarrass him.
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.680]  I definitely wasn't there.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.301]  Cut!
[01:27:47.341 --> 01:27:47.921]  Pause again.
[01:27:47.981 --> 01:27:51.823]  The implication that we want scum like you at these events.
[01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:54.764]  The implication that we're not part of your cool club.
[01:27:54.964 --> 01:27:56.364]  You're a bunch of scum!
[01:27:56.625 --> 01:27:57.165]  Go back to him.
[01:27:59.461 --> 01:28:06.970]  If Trump was not having his 6.30 dinner with Steve Bannon, then more to his liking, he was in bed by that time with a cheeseburger.
[01:28:08.493 --> 01:28:10.154]  Why am I even reading this sh**?
[01:28:10.454 --> 01:28:11.914]  I can't believe this.
[01:28:12.314 --> 01:28:15.236]  I can't believe that he's... I can't believe it.
[01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:16.216]  This is fake.
[01:28:16.236 --> 01:28:17.416]  This is how he lives his life?
[01:28:17.436 --> 01:28:20.277]  That's how he lives his life?
[01:28:20.698 --> 01:28:24.339]  If my shirt is on the floor, it's because I want it on the floor.
[01:28:24.759 --> 01:28:25.439]  Another one.
[01:28:25.699 --> 01:28:26.220]  It's Rita Best.
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:28.100]  It's DJ Kevin.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:31.822]  Matter of fact, this is the best spoken word album in the game.
[01:28:32.102 --> 01:28:33.782]  I'm finally gonna win my Grammy!
[01:28:33.802 --> 01:28:34.723]  So this isn't gonna work.
[01:28:34.783 --> 01:28:35.103]  Next!
[01:28:35.663 --> 01:28:36.384]  It's not gonna work!
[01:28:36.484 --> 01:28:37.625]  Everything I do works!
[01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:38.386]  Stand by.
[01:28:38.406 --> 01:28:38.966]  Take one.
[01:28:39.827 --> 01:28:41.769]  He had a long time fear of being poisoned.
[01:28:41.789 --> 01:28:42.630]  And now the snapping turtle.
[01:28:42.911 --> 01:28:44.953]  One reason why he liked to eat at McDonald's.
[01:28:45.293 --> 01:28:49.037]  Nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely pre-made.
[01:28:49.337 --> 01:28:49.758]  That's it!
[01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:50.198]  We've got it!
[01:28:50.358 --> 01:28:50.839]  That's the one.
[01:28:51.019 --> 01:28:51.660]  You think so?
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:51.960]  Oh yeah.
[01:28:52.140 --> 01:28:53.101]  The Grammy's in the bag?
[01:28:53.301 --> 01:28:53.662]  In the bag.
[01:28:57.975 --> 01:29:02.416]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:29:02.636 --> 01:29:07.338]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:29:07.938 --> 01:29:13.779]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:29:14.239 --> 01:29:26.783]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, let's make it a bigger capsule that's powdered, so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:29:27.543 --> 01:29:36.210]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:38.152]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:29:38.472 --> 01:29:39.593]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:29:39.613 --> 01:29:40.894]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:29:40.914 --> 01:29:42.275]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:29:42.415 --> 01:29:43.975]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:29:44.475 --> 01:29:46.076]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:29:46.096 --> 01:29:47.896]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:29:48.236 --> 01:29:50.837]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:29:50.877 --> 01:29:51.737]  This is insane.
[01:29:52.157 --> 01:29:53.777]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:29:54.037 --> 01:29:56.578]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:29:57.038 --> 01:30:00.419]  He says, this is totally free, but he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:30:00.439 --> 01:30:02.279]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:30:03.159 --> 01:30:09.081]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:30:09.321 --> 01:30:10.681]  All just moderate dose.
[01:30:12.193 --> 01:30:20.185]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:30:20.225 --> 01:30:22.608]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:22.628 --> 01:30:23.790]  But thank you for committing.
[01:30:27.854 --> 01:30:30.676]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:30:31.056 --> 01:30:33.658]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:38.462]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:30:38.922 --> 01:30:45.046]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:30:45.066 --> 01:30:48.189]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:30:48.529 --> 01:30:49.850]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:30:56.331 --> 01:31:00.155]  With Alpha Power by InfoWars Life, you can be in charge of your energy again.
[01:31:00.475 --> 01:31:05.419]  Alpha Power helps with a large amount of functions for your body to help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.303]  Alpha Power has a 4.8 star rating on InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:31:09.603 --> 01:31:13.146]  Listen to all these incredible five star reviews from verified buyers.
[01:31:13.487 --> 01:31:16.590]  Papa Black Wilson says, whatever's in this is doing something good.
[01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:19.012]  I take it daily as I would any other daily vitamin.
[01:31:19.252 --> 01:31:26.194]  And it's got me in a state where even the normal day of a few hours sleep, rest easy, and wake up positive, regardless of the amount of sleep I get.
[01:31:26.315 --> 01:31:28.655]  And what Alex was hinting at when he first released this product?
[01:31:28.895 --> 01:31:30.596]  Yeah, the missus surely enjoys it.
[01:31:30.796 --> 01:31:33.437]  Frank John says, this stuff is incredible.
[01:31:33.677 --> 01:31:38.219]  Wow, this is like taking brain force mixed with super male vitality at the same time.
[01:31:38.539 --> 01:31:44.601]  Alpha Power makes me feel well mentally, makes me want to exercise more, and helps me feel a little more confident.
[01:31:45.041 --> 01:31:49.565]  After about a week and a half or two, I started to really feel the huge raise in my male drive.
[01:31:50.045 --> 01:31:51.186]  That helps with focus, too.
[01:31:51.626 --> 01:31:52.607]  Like Brain Force Plus.
[01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:57.230]  I've tried about 15 InfoWars Life Health products, and they're always of supreme quality.
[01:31:57.651 --> 01:32:01.694]  LJ says, it's been five days since my boyfriend began taking Alpha Power.
[01:32:01.974 --> 01:32:03.495]  There's definitely been a change.
[01:32:03.775 --> 01:32:04.416]  For the better.
[01:32:04.836 --> 01:32:08.619]  Without getting too personal, our activity has increased, and that's fine by me.
[01:32:09.019 --> 01:32:10.701]  He also says he's got a bit more energy.
[01:32:11.101 --> 01:32:11.982]  I hope this lasts.
[01:32:12.822 --> 01:32:14.884]  One Eye Jack says, Alpha Power.
[01:32:15.184 --> 01:32:21.290]  I took Alpha Power for the first time this morning, and after about 15 minutes I felt so awake and alert and full of energy.
[01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:26.534]  I take Super Mail and Brain Force as well, but I have to say, this blows them both out of the water.
[01:32:26.995 --> 01:32:30.318]  Defeat the Globalists said, more energy at the end of the day.
[01:32:30.918 --> 01:32:35.943]  Taking one capsule a day in the AM, and even after being on the go all day, there's no crash at night.
[01:32:36.483 --> 01:32:38.304]  I'd feel exhausted after 8pm.
[01:32:38.584 --> 01:32:39.105]  Not anymore.
[01:32:39.485 --> 01:32:40.666]  Seem to be sleeping better too.
[01:32:41.246 --> 01:32:43.067]  I seem to have upped my water intake as well.
[01:32:43.307 --> 01:32:44.688]  I will definitely buy this again.
[01:32:45.469 --> 01:32:48.791]  Head to infowarrestore.com and experience Alpha Power today.
[01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:51.713]  That's infowarrestore.com.
[01:32:59.057 --> 01:33:01.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.571 --> 01:33:15.828]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.213 --> 01:33:21.655]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to your phone calls.
[01:33:22.415 --> 01:33:26.559]  We're going to John in Wyoming, Amy in New Jersey, Forrest in house.
[01:33:27.259 --> 01:33:28.980]  We're going to go to Tom in London.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:33.103]  We're going to go to Mark in Oregon, George in Connecticut, Chris and many, many others.
[01:33:33.664 --> 01:33:35.425]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:35.485 --> 01:33:39.068]  The websites are Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:33:41.087 --> 01:33:43.169]  Hillary Clinton does not know when to go away.
[01:33:43.969 --> 01:33:46.371]  She is back there at the Grammys tanking their ratings.
[01:33:47.212 --> 01:33:53.898]  Hollywood doesn't understand that people are sick of this or they just don't care because their job is controlling and dominating people.
[01:33:56.032 --> 01:33:58.813]  When they politically control us, they get trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:07.875]  Even though there's hundreds of billions of dollars a year in entertainment, that is still secondary to its overall mission of suppressing and controlling the people.
[01:34:08.295 --> 01:34:12.356]  The White House is set to have a press briefing on why McCabe stepped down.
[01:34:12.376 --> 01:34:13.857]  We're going to carry some of that.
[01:34:13.877 --> 01:34:15.457]  I want to carry the opening statement.
[01:34:17.574 --> 01:34:19.916]  Not so much even the questions, but we know why.
[01:34:20.396 --> 01:34:27.342]  It's now come out, reported last hour, that he was the main leaker in meetings with the president that were on leaks.
[01:34:29.724 --> 01:34:34.808]  And again, they were using the fact that it was secret to act like bad things were happening and putting out fake leaks.
[01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:38.912]  And all of this is coming home to roost.
[01:34:40.753 --> 01:34:41.614]  Before we go to your calls,
[01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:48.271]  We have a new special we're running at InfoWareStore.com, and it is your purchase of the products that makes everything possible.
[01:34:48.592 --> 01:34:49.672]  Plus, these are great products.
[01:34:49.952 --> 01:34:54.993]  BrainForce, we went out and researched the top nootropic brain pills that are healthy and natural.
[01:34:55.013 --> 01:34:58.454]  There's a lot of them out there that are powerful, but they're not known as being healthy or natural.
[01:34:59.835 --> 01:35:03.316]  BrainForce is, and that's why it's become incredibly popular.
[01:35:03.436 --> 01:35:04.516]  It has close to 6,000 reviews, 5,828.
[01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:12.649]  An average of 92% or a 4.8 star.
[01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:13.910]  Unprecedented.
[01:35:14.410 --> 01:35:15.971]  It's Brain Force Plus.
[01:35:16.051 --> 01:35:18.193]  There's now 20% more in each bottle.
[01:35:18.533 --> 01:35:21.535]  Leading competitors cost two to three times more and aren't even as good.
[01:35:21.936 --> 01:35:23.717]  We have it for 40% off.
[01:35:24.598 --> 01:35:26.599]  And we have Vitamin Mineral Fusion with it.
[01:35:26.979 --> 01:35:34.885]  When you get the two together, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Advanced Multi-Vitamin Formulation with all the vitamins, all the minerals, the trace elements, and then it's got
[01:35:35.766 --> 01:35:39.968]  The Amino Acids for Better Upload, great for adults, great for children, all natural.
[01:35:40.288 --> 01:35:42.208]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:35:42.268 --> 01:35:46.990]  And no reviews yet on that because it's the new special.
[01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:50.691]  As you can see right there, your purchase makes the broadcast possible.
[01:35:51.952 --> 01:35:59.735]  Separately, I am very excited that we did this as an introductory offer because we're about to sell out of it the next week.
[01:36:00.689 --> 01:36:08.371]  It deals with seasonal distress disorder, the pollen, the issues, the sneezing, the headaches that hit so many people around the country at different times of the year.
[01:36:09.011 --> 01:36:19.174]  Japanese quail, it's secret, no one knows why, fed a special diet in France before they discovered it, has a major, major, major, major effect
[01:36:20.711 --> 01:36:20.891]  Yeah.
[01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:43.370]  InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:45.491]  That is selling out.
[01:36:45.851 --> 01:36:49.272]  Hopefully we'll get more in a few months, but it is just blasting off the shelves.
[01:36:49.593 --> 01:36:50.893]  So that is definitely a hit product.
[01:36:51.273 --> 01:36:52.293]  InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:36:53.134 --> 01:36:56.975]  And something else that's going to blast off the shelves, BodyEase.
[01:36:57.055 --> 01:36:57.415]  BodyEase.
[01:36:57.755 --> 01:37:00.316]  Whole Body Support Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:37:00.676 --> 01:37:03.097]  It's got over 400 milligrams of pure turmeric.
[01:37:03.377 --> 01:37:05.998]  That's 95% curcumin.
[01:37:06.578 --> 01:37:10.620]  When the leading competitors are 3%, they just rip you off and just give you, I guess,
[01:37:12.132 --> 01:37:13.513]  The outside of the root or whatever.
[01:37:13.933 --> 01:37:17.175]  This is 95% and we can prove all that.
[01:37:18.196 --> 01:37:20.417]  From the top lab in the country, 60 Day Supplies.
[01:37:20.557 --> 01:37:27.801]  If you don't know what this does for you, you need to research the incredible effects that are documented with turmeric.
[01:37:27.821 --> 01:37:34.405]  And then it's got other compounds that are also incredibly antioxidants like organic lemon balm leaf, boswilla.
[01:37:35.626 --> 01:37:38.748]  It's got the organic thyme leaf.
[01:37:41.226 --> 01:37:42.788]  and other key ingredients.
[01:37:42.888 --> 01:37:45.911]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:50.036]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:37:50.396 --> 01:37:53.659]  Please support our local A&F affiliates, TV stations, you name it.
[01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:55.682]  Support those local sponsors.
[01:37:56.182 --> 01:37:56.422]  Okay.
[01:37:57.418 --> 01:37:59.621]  Let's go to your phone calls now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:37:59.641 --> 01:38:15.620]  We're awaiting just at least the opening statement at the press conference about the FBI acting director who we now know ran the fake Russiagate dossier, lied to the president, said he didn't, was such a good liar the president had him in meetings about the leakers when he was there with Darth Sidious.
[01:38:16.783 --> 01:38:20.066]  It's almost like Yoda and Mace Windu to use a cheesy Star Wars analogy.
[01:38:20.086 --> 01:38:22.609]  They're like, we're blinded by the powers of the Sith Lord.
[01:38:22.929 --> 01:38:23.489]  Where is he?
[01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:29.155]  And the head senator is saying, I don't know, but find him immediately.
[01:38:29.175 --> 01:38:33.619]  They're like right there with him.
[01:38:33.679 --> 01:38:36.102]  So it's just insane.
[01:38:38.092 --> 01:38:39.553]  Our caller in London hung up.
[01:38:40.133 --> 01:38:41.873]  I wanted to go to the caller in London first.
[01:38:41.973 --> 01:38:44.094]  Caller in London, if you get back in, we'll go right back to you.
[01:38:44.654 --> 01:38:45.274]  That's a bummer.
[01:38:45.795 --> 01:38:48.415]  John in Wyoming, you're on the air.
[01:38:48.475 --> 01:38:49.056]  Thanks for holding.
[01:38:49.096 --> 01:38:49.376]  Welcome.
[01:38:50.436 --> 01:38:52.857]  Alex, it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.
[01:38:53.696 --> 01:39:00.798]  And I was watching Fox about 45 minutes ago and I saw them announce that Andrew McCabe is going to be stepping down.
[01:39:01.378 --> 01:39:05.300]  I think what we're going to see here is like a snowball rolling downhill.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:09.581]  We're going to see more and more of these Obama holdovers being exposed.
[01:39:10.228 --> 01:39:16.850]  To the American public so they can see just how sleazy that Hillary and Obama really are.
[01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:22.111]  That they will stop at nothing to try to destroy President Trump.
[01:39:22.571 --> 01:39:34.214]  And I think these recent charges that have come up against Steve Wynn, these, you know, about sexual improprieties toward his employees, I think are just a crock.
[01:39:34.774 --> 01:39:45.145]  Because it's the same prostitute news media that was attacking President Trump because he once had two scoops of ice cream on his dessert rather than one.
[01:39:45.866 --> 01:39:51.672]  Who the hell needs the prostitute media to tell us how much ice cream we can eat?
[01:39:52.092 --> 01:39:57.138]  Who needs them to tell us anything or whom we can vote for for president?
[01:39:57.634 --> 01:40:03.802]  These people are so desperate they will lie about anyone and everyone who supports President Trump.
[01:40:04.022 --> 01:40:12.092]  You're right, and they've been in power so long, even as their ratings go down, we're talking on average 20% a year, and we're like in the year three of this.
[01:40:13.899 --> 01:40:15.220]  It's devastating everything.
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.822]  Hollywood's down 20% this year.
[01:40:16.842 --> 01:40:18.363]  NFL over 20%.
[01:40:18.703 --> 01:40:19.544]  Grammy's over 20%.
[01:40:20.185 --> 01:40:23.828]  They are self-immolating themselves, and they just can't stop.
[01:40:23.928 --> 01:40:25.790]  And of course, I did check.
[01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:29.513]  It's true about the two scoops of ice cream, but it wasn't like other people don't get more.
[01:40:29.553 --> 01:40:30.514]  He just likes a big dessert.
[01:40:30.534 --> 01:40:31.615]  His drug is food.
[01:40:32.076 --> 01:40:32.816]  Trump likes food.
[01:40:32.836 --> 01:40:33.477]  It's admitted.
[01:40:33.517 --> 01:40:34.077]  He doesn't drink.
[01:40:34.098 --> 01:40:35.339]  He doesn't do other stuff.
[01:40:35.359 --> 01:40:36.500]  But the point is, is that
[01:40:37.810 --> 01:40:40.931]  They then, you know, Fire and Fury says he goes to sleep at 6.30 at night!
[01:40:41.251 --> 01:40:42.691]  That's a complete and total lie!
[01:40:43.151 --> 01:40:46.712]  I mean, so they've tried to say he works too much, now they're saying the other thing.
[01:40:46.752 --> 01:40:47.933]  Here's my concern, John.
[01:40:48.573 --> 01:40:55.295]  I'm worried that because before they were hubris-filled, as I've said, and thought Hillary would win, so they committed these crimes.
[01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:58.056]  Now they've committed more crimes because they're desperate to cover it up.
[01:40:58.236 --> 01:41:02.797]  Now, what are they going to do in the next few weeks as their whole house of cards comes down?
[01:41:04.304 --> 01:41:15.827]  Well, one of the things that I'm worried about is that since they still have so many holdovers in the Justice Department and in the FBI and, you know, all of these corrupt agencies,
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:20.484]  That they're going to maybe try to put an assassination on our president.
[01:41:20.864 --> 01:41:24.027]  And if they do, it's going to hit the fan from coast to coast.
[01:41:24.667 --> 01:41:29.891]  Yeah, I'm not a violent person and I'm not planning anything, as I've said, but I mean, I want to warn the establishment.
[01:41:29.952 --> 01:41:30.512]  Right, none of us are.
[01:41:30.692 --> 01:41:31.813]  Exactly, I want to warn the establishment.
[01:41:32.434 --> 01:41:37.798]  Everybody is sick of the globalists, the local bureaucrats, the UN people, the communists, all of those people.
[01:41:38.439 --> 01:41:40.300]  Everybody's like Santa Claus and making a list.
[01:41:41.676 --> 01:41:45.357]  I'm just reporting what people are saying everywhere, and they're committed.
[01:41:45.557 --> 01:41:57.702]  If they were dumb enough to kill the president, guaranteed, within six hours of it happening, the globalists better be smart enough to be in a bunker somewhere, is all I'm saying.
[01:41:58.922 --> 01:42:01.383]  Or they'd better be on that first mission to Mars.
[01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:04.571]  You're absolutely right.
[01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:06.072]  But listen, here's the deal.
[01:42:06.112 --> 01:42:10.595]  We know why Mudd, four months ago, was saying, we're going to kill the president while they were on TV.
[01:42:10.675 --> 01:42:12.216]  Brennan and them saying, we're going to take him out.
[01:42:12.636 --> 01:42:15.138]  It was to confidence game their minions.
[01:42:15.158 --> 01:42:16.779]  Their minions, we now have the text messages.
[01:42:17.379 --> 01:42:20.761]  Six months ago, we're running scared saying, we got to stop this in the text messages.
[01:42:21.242 --> 01:42:25.644]  So a lot of these names we've seen have now turned over to Congress, by the way.
[01:42:26.165 --> 01:42:27.706]  And so that's why we're winning right now.
[01:42:28.649 --> 01:42:38.192]  Well, I'm just wondering what it's going to take before Jeff Sessions starts doing his job and starts prosecuting these people who are threatening the President's life.
[01:42:38.692 --> 01:42:40.713]  Jeff Sessions is 100% compromised.
[01:42:40.733 --> 01:42:41.413]  We now know that.
[01:42:42.234 --> 01:42:44.054]  And, uh... I think they have something on him.
[01:42:44.374 --> 01:42:45.495]  Oh, they certainly do.
[01:42:45.595 --> 01:42:49.676]  And I think... I think I know what it is, too.
[01:42:50.876 --> 01:42:51.437]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:51.457 --> 01:42:52.157]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:42:55.675 --> 01:43:04.687]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting, 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:43:04.767 --> 01:43:12.878]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:43:13.158 --> 01:43:17.860]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:43:18.021 --> 01:43:24.744]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:43:24.824 --> 01:43:31.907]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:43:32.008 --> 01:43:38.851]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:43.372]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:43:43.493 --> 01:43:46.774]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:43:46.894 --> 01:43:53.036]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:43:53.176 --> 01:43:54.876]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:58.718 --> 01:44:03.059]  Proper B vitamin intake is essential to keep the body functioning at optimum levels.
[01:44:03.419 --> 01:44:04.900]  O-O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:44:05.987 --> 01:44:10.591]  With our modern diets, it can be hard to get the recommended amount of B vitamins we need every day.
[01:44:10.611 --> 01:44:12.573]  O-O-O-Optimum levels.
[01:44:12.953 --> 01:44:14.515]  B vitamins we need every day.
[01:44:14.735 --> 01:44:19.820]  Secret 12 combines two bioactive forms of vitamin B12 for optimal absorption.
[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:21.622]  O-O-O-O-Optimal absorption.
[01:44:22.342 --> 01:44:27.425]  Being deficient in B vitamins can cause fatigue, depression, poor memory, and lethargy.
[01:44:27.965 --> 01:44:28.326]  Secret 12.
[01:44:29.806 --> 01:44:30.687]  Optimal absorption.
[01:44:30.967 --> 01:44:35.670]  B vitamins help the body convert food into energy by supporting your intercellular processes.
[01:44:36.110 --> 01:44:40.313]  B vitamins are also essential for the optimal functioning of the brain and nervous system.
[01:44:41.293 --> 01:44:42.034]  Optimum levels.
[01:44:43.455 --> 01:44:47.281]  Secret 12 is an easy way to increase your vitamin B12 intake.
[01:44:47.622 --> 01:44:51.969]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and support optimal brain and body function with Secret 12.

[01:44:57.674 --> 01:45:01.116]  So what do you think of our X2, uh, you know, true atomic iodine?
[01:45:28.294 --> 01:45:32.477]  Iodine is essential to every cell development, especially in children.
[01:45:33.058 --> 01:45:42.624]  And iodine is concentrated in the gland where it filters the serum coming through your blood and extracts whatever iodine is present.
[01:45:42.824 --> 01:45:48.627]  If the iodine is not present in sufficient numbers, your thyroid gland has to work double time.
[01:45:48.747 --> 01:45:52.890]  In the extreme, it reaches the limit.
[01:45:52.950 --> 01:46:03.036]  So then the pituitary gland sends a thyroid growth hormone to it to make sure that it's bigger so it can process more serum and get more iodine from it.
[01:46:03.776 --> 01:46:07.077]  In the ultimate extreme, it's called goiter.
[01:46:07.517 --> 01:46:08.337]  It's a disease.
[01:46:08.958 --> 01:46:21.161]  And people don't realize that if you are short of iodine, if you're deficient, your cells will not mature properly, develop, and never mind radiation coming from Fukushima,
[01:46:21.681 --> 01:46:27.205]  But at the same time, iodine enables your cells to develop.
[01:46:27.485 --> 01:46:30.307]  And it's very important for muscular brain development.
[01:46:30.707 --> 01:46:36.071]  A lot of brain problems and breast cancer may be attributable to iodine deficiency.
[01:46:36.171 --> 01:46:43.315]  And by the way, you can just search engine mainstream news admits iodine deficiency on average 15 IQ point reductions, then fluoride added another 15.
[01:46:43.736 --> 01:46:44.656]  It's all admitted.
[01:46:44.696 --> 01:46:51.381]  This is a plan where they bomb us with a bad halogen that our thyroid then uses and it basically then gives us the swollen thyroid.
[01:47:00.023 --> 01:47:04.685]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.907 --> 01:47:20.129]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.846 --> 01:48:04.654]  This isn't meet the new boss same as the old boss because the globalists are having convulsions This is a true revolution and it's back to big aggressive Americana wealth freedom Wild Wild West get out of the way Just like yesterday
[01:48:06.408 --> 01:48:08.629]  I get on my knees and pray.
[01:48:10.289 --> 01:48:11.969]  Won't get fooled again.
[01:48:11.989 --> 01:48:16.930]  We don't get fooled again.
[01:48:17.631 --> 01:48:19.751]  This song comes around like every hundred years.
[01:48:19.811 --> 01:48:20.591]  Enjoy it, folks.
[01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:22.472]  It ain't perfect, but it's real.
[01:48:23.092 --> 01:48:25.752]  That's why the parasites are going crazy.
[01:48:26.232 --> 01:48:26.573]  Woo!
[01:48:27.013 --> 01:48:28.213]  Going back to your phone calls here.
[01:48:28.273 --> 01:48:29.293]  George in Connecticut.
[01:48:30.193 --> 01:48:31.554]  George, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:48:31.594 --> 01:48:32.794]  We'll go to Mark in Oregon and others.
[01:48:33.601 --> 01:48:35.242]  Yeah, I have three points.
[01:48:35.502 --> 01:48:51.991]  One, I think we should bring on an expert on the old-fashioned grand jury system, that you don't need a prosecutor to bring it together, so we can stop prosecuting these politicians who will not go after these criminals who are in the government misusing the intelligence and investigating people like that.
[01:48:55.553 --> 01:49:10.787]  On the back of that, I was up in Kingston with Joe Sollente, Gary Null, and Ralph Nader about a year ago, and we were discussing a lot of issues, and Ralph Nader came out with a book, I don't remember the exact title, it's been a while,
[01:49:11.267 --> 01:49:13.608]  Well, I've had Ralph Nader on before and I've invited him back on.
[01:49:13.748 --> 01:49:14.788]  He hasn't come on.
[01:49:32.873 --> 01:49:33.553]  I totally agree.
[01:49:33.573 --> 01:49:36.214]  We've got population, we've got wars, we've got issues.
[01:49:36.614 --> 01:49:39.755]  I want everybody to come together, but not under some authoritarian world government.
[01:49:39.775 --> 01:49:42.316]  Look at this article by Kit Daniels that's got to go viral.
[01:49:42.896 --> 01:49:46.797]  The Chinese Death Star laser under development in Shanghai lab.
[01:49:47.237 --> 01:49:51.719]  The laser is so powerful, they believe it punches a hole in the space-time continuum.
[01:49:53.035 --> 01:49:54.716]  And actually creates black holes.
[01:49:54.876 --> 01:49:55.996]  This is mainstream news.
[01:49:56.396 --> 01:49:58.197]  Now obviously the US is way ahead of this.
[01:49:58.257 --> 01:50:00.017]  We've made antimatter weapons and stuff.
[01:50:00.297 --> 01:50:01.898]  But everybody's going to start getting this.
[01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:04.599]  And this just shows how dangerous the planet is.
[01:50:05.099 --> 01:50:07.579]  And then what do we do when Kim Jong-un tries to get something like this?
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:09.820]  So that story's on Infowars.com.
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:13.621]  Overall though, listen, do you disagree or agree?
[01:50:14.041 --> 01:50:19.743]  I mean, Trump has got a lot of the globalists mad because they want wealth without the people having it.
[01:50:20.223 --> 01:50:22.184]  The establishment itself is really pissed off at Trump.
[01:50:22.204 --> 01:50:22.604]  What do you think?
[01:50:23.493 --> 01:50:24.454]  I think absolutely.
[01:50:24.494 --> 01:50:26.195]  But I have an idea on that issue, too.
[01:50:26.635 --> 01:50:44.346]  Why not have a two-year tax rebate for all those states that basically are the blue states, if they get rid of all the illegals in the poor communities that are basically burdening those taxpayers, basically losing their homes or can't even feed themselves because they're loading up the schools?
[01:50:44.366 --> 01:50:45.306]  I think that's a great idea.
[01:50:45.367 --> 01:50:47.488]  And again, I'm not against all these economic refugees.
[01:50:47.548 --> 01:50:49.189]  I realize the globalists exploited them.
[01:50:49.629 --> 01:50:50.910]  They're being collapsed into us.
[01:50:50.970 --> 01:50:51.871]  But it's not fair.
[01:50:52.871 --> 01:50:54.593]  And Trump goes, OK, I'll do 800,000.
[01:50:54.774 --> 01:50:56.356]  I'll do 1.8 million.
[01:50:56.376 --> 01:50:56.996]  And they go, no.
[01:50:57.297 --> 01:50:58.178]  Total open borders.
[01:50:58.198 --> 01:50:58.859]  We want everything.
[01:50:59.179 --> 01:51:00.340]  It shows where it's going.
[01:51:00.721 --> 01:51:07.029]  Trump's just trying to be reasonable, stabilize the economy, and they won't even let him do that, showing it's a fraud.
[01:51:08.544 --> 01:51:08.744]  Yeah.
[01:51:09.324 --> 01:51:16.266]  I mean Bernie Sanders went on TV this weekend and said, we did shut down the government, we can't, we have to have totally open borders!
[01:51:16.846 --> 01:51:20.787]  But you know, nobody else has open borders like that, thank you so much George.
[01:51:21.367 --> 01:51:22.688]  Okay, who's up next here?
[01:51:24.248 --> 01:51:27.209]  Amy wants to put the memo out now, we'll go to her in just a minute as well.
[01:51:27.769 --> 01:51:31.370]  We got Forrest, we got so many calls to get here.
[01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:32.871]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:51:34.731 --> 01:51:37.612]  Let's go ahead and talk to Amy in New Jersey, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:51:39.246 --> 01:51:45.331]  Hi Alex, you know, Trump really needs to spill it out tomorrow night at his State of the Union.
[01:51:46.031 --> 01:51:46.552]  Wait a minute!
[01:51:46.612 --> 01:51:47.092]  Wait a minute!
[01:51:47.132 --> 01:51:47.612]  Wait a minute!
[01:51:47.652 --> 01:51:51.555]  We had a caller last week that said he ought to release the memo at the State of the Union.
[01:51:51.775 --> 01:51:53.657]  They're going to pass it tonight to let him get it.
[01:51:53.897 --> 01:51:55.278]  He's got to declassify it then.
[01:51:55.298 --> 01:51:56.979]  I was thinking it'd take a few days.
[01:51:57.179 --> 01:51:59.401]  I bet he releases it tomorrow at the State of the Union.
[01:52:00.097 --> 01:52:00.637]  You know why?
[01:52:00.657 --> 01:52:02.599]  He's going to miss an opportunity.
[01:52:02.619 --> 01:52:11.006]  You've got my socialist father, my socialist sister, who will continue to watch and get brainwashed by MSNBC and CNN.
[01:52:11.506 --> 01:52:15.029]  They're going to miss an opportunity to deprogram people.
[01:52:15.049 --> 01:52:16.150]  Well, Amy, you're such a genius.
[01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:16.991]  Let me just shut up.
[01:52:17.511 --> 01:52:22.255]  Let me just shut up and have you restart, because I want people to hear this in your own words, not me guessing what you were going to say.
[01:52:22.616 --> 01:52:25.298]  Repeat what you were about to say when I obnoxiously interrupted you.
[01:52:26.303 --> 01:52:29.608]  We have to brain deprogram the people.
[01:52:29.768 --> 01:52:37.579]  Like I was at my father's house, my parents' house yesterday and like he's watching this MSNBC and I'm like, you have no idea what's going to drop, Dad.
[01:52:37.599 --> 01:52:40.744]  I'm like, and if you tell him anything, he'll blow up.
[01:52:41.264 --> 01:52:42.186]  Like, oh, you're
[01:52:42.606 --> 01:52:45.107]  You are such a right-wing conspiracy.
[01:52:45.127 --> 01:52:46.667]  You cannot argue with these people.
[01:52:46.707 --> 01:52:50.828]  You need to get on there tomorrow night and totally lay it out.
[01:52:50.928 --> 01:52:52.389]  He needs a whiteboard.
[01:52:52.449 --> 01:52:55.989]  He needs to do diagrams and tell people what's going on.
[01:52:56.029 --> 01:52:57.530]  That's a missed opportunity.
[01:52:57.990 --> 01:53:00.951]  Strike when the iron's hot, not when it dies down.
[01:53:01.551 --> 01:53:04.091]  And I want you to be on the military tribunal.
[01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:04.712]  I would love to see you.
[01:53:06.667 --> 01:53:09.152]  Roast these people at a military tribunal.
[01:53:09.172 --> 01:53:11.155]  You would be the best one to do it, Alex.
[01:53:11.896 --> 01:53:15.563]  Well, you're a sweetheart, Amy, but that could turn into what we're trying to fight here.
[01:53:15.884 --> 01:53:18.268]  I think grand juries, the citizens, you name it.
[01:53:18.328 --> 01:53:19.490]  But you're absolutely right that...
[01:53:20.376 --> 01:53:21.537]  They work for foreign powers.
[01:53:21.997 --> 01:53:23.558]  The globals are trying to overturn the country.
[01:53:23.578 --> 01:53:26.559]  They're trying to overturn our revolution against them.
[01:53:26.919 --> 01:53:30.241]  And so there could be military tribunals under international law under this.
[01:53:30.261 --> 01:53:33.843]  But I just want to fix this now, but not to steal your thunder.
[01:53:33.883 --> 01:53:35.844]  What you're saying is, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:53:36.364 --> 01:53:48.651]  Trump should release the memo tomorrow, right before his State of the Union, so that he can get into the collusion and the conspiracy against the voters of America and tell people that we're conned
[01:53:49.551 --> 01:53:50.451]  By the media lies.
[01:53:50.831 --> 01:53:51.592]  I care about you.
[01:53:51.652 --> 01:53:52.732]  I want you to be prosperous.
[01:53:53.112 --> 01:53:55.273]  Globalists have been screwing this country over for a long time.
[01:53:56.013 --> 01:53:57.594]  Please, they're brainwashing you.
[01:53:58.114 --> 01:54:02.535]  I'm asking you to really research what's happened and to understand this is not business as usual.
[01:54:02.995 --> 01:54:04.336]  Look at what's happening with the economy.
[01:54:04.376 --> 01:54:04.776]  You name it.
[01:54:05.706 --> 01:54:06.587]  I'm not that good.
[01:54:07.088 --> 01:54:09.371]  There were artificial controls to make you poor.
[01:54:09.652 --> 01:54:11.915]  We're just removing them because we believe in you.
[01:54:12.415 --> 01:54:14.719]  I think if he said that, it would devastate him once and for all.
[01:54:15.119 --> 01:54:17.943]  I'm worried they'll set a nuke off tomorrow or something and kill the president.
[01:54:18.224 --> 01:54:19.706]  I mean, there's no telling what they'll do.
[01:54:20.765 --> 01:54:22.725]  Well, you know, I have a nine-year-old daughter.
[01:54:22.785 --> 01:54:23.446]  You have kids.
[01:54:23.566 --> 01:54:24.666]  This is about the kids.
[01:54:24.706 --> 01:54:29.767]  This is about giving them hope for their future, so that they want to have their own children.
[01:54:29.907 --> 01:54:30.767]  And that's key again.
[01:54:31.628 --> 01:54:36.129]  Get this lady's name, because just like the caller earlier, I want to have a show with the callers, where it's our best callers.
[01:54:36.509 --> 01:54:37.409]  Everything she's saying is true.
[01:54:37.749 --> 01:54:41.150]  It's not we want to be like Oprah Winfrey, everything's wonderful, la la la.
[01:54:42.179 --> 01:54:52.130]  What you're saying is they've been demoralizing us in the media, telling us we're bad, making us fight with each other, and then here comes Trump with all his positivity and it's working because we've got some good things to celebrate here.
[01:54:52.150 --> 01:54:53.010]  You're absolutely right.
[01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:56.975]  So you're saying you're refreshed by the fact that Trump's not trying to demoralize us.
[01:54:58.055 --> 01:55:06.538]  Absolutely, and I'm Jewish, and I'm sick of the liberal Jews that are being the capos again to set us up to get scapegoated for a new world order.
[01:55:07.278 --> 01:55:09.499]  You know, we just had Holocaust Remembrance Day.
[01:55:09.939 --> 01:55:13.360]  Well, you know, I don't think people have learned.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.821]  The liberal Jews have not learned.
[01:55:14.861 --> 01:55:20.042]  All they want to do is the same thing as the black people of this country, to play the victim.
[01:55:20.082 --> 01:55:21.503]  We have to stop playing the victim.
[01:55:22.243 --> 01:55:27.426]  Open your eyes, see what's going on, and see repeated patterns and stop the patterns.
[01:55:27.486 --> 01:55:28.626]  What you just said is key.
[01:55:28.706 --> 01:55:29.627]  What you just said is key.
[01:55:29.667 --> 01:55:31.188]  It's the equation you never hear from Hollywood.
[01:55:31.208 --> 01:55:32.668]  Yeah, Jews do get persecuted.
[01:55:32.988 --> 01:55:33.509]  It's wrong.
[01:55:33.529 --> 01:55:34.389]  Hitler, horrible.
[01:55:34.749 --> 01:55:37.471]  But absolutely, leftist Jews and others...
[01:55:38.251 --> 01:55:51.555]  Historically have sat there, helped build this up, done these things with the corrupt regime like Hitler and others, and then they leave the country and scapegoat the Jewish population, and they make the Jewish population pay them money to get out.
[01:55:52.015 --> 01:55:55.276]  It's absolutely horrible, and that's part of the equation.
[01:55:55.296 --> 01:55:57.177]  And people will say, Jones just said the Jews run it all.
[01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:58.217]  No, it's the opposite.
[01:55:59.198 --> 01:56:08.928]  You can see the UN and Soros, who set up the Jews in his earlier life doing it again, in his own WikiLeaks saying he wants to overthrow Israel and all this stuff.
[01:56:09.248 --> 01:56:14.814]  You can see them under the UN world government setting Israel and Jews up to be scapegoated again.
[01:56:14.834 --> 01:56:15.795]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:56:16.761 --> 01:56:17.482]  That's what this is.
[01:56:17.582 --> 01:56:18.102]  I see it.
[01:56:18.283 --> 01:56:19.844]  My family was in the Holocaust.
[01:56:20.064 --> 01:56:21.266]  I've seen this before.
[01:56:21.946 --> 01:56:31.416]  And my great-grandparents, my mother's great-grandmother or grandmother, they rounded them up in Romania and shot them in the ditch by Assad's group.
[01:56:31.476 --> 01:56:33.438]  And don't give up your guns, Jews.
[01:56:33.638 --> 01:56:34.058]  Come on.
[01:56:34.419 --> 01:56:39.183]  You've got to fight and not let them disarm anybody, because it will happen again if you let that happen.
[01:56:39.884 --> 01:56:40.604]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:40.744 --> 01:56:41.804]  God bless you, absolutely.
[01:56:41.825 --> 01:56:46.946]  Some of the greatest folks fighting tyranny are Jewish, and then some of the worst people, you know, like George Soros, is Jewish.
[01:56:46.986 --> 01:56:48.366]  But George Soros isn't Jewish.
[01:56:48.646 --> 01:56:49.466]  He's a demon.
[01:56:50.046 --> 01:57:04.570]  He helped round up thousands of Jews, bragged about it, and was so arrogant he bragged about it on 60 Minutes and wrote a book about it, and then he wants to shut me down because I talk about it, and then Hollywood Jews go, Alex, we like your show and you're a good guy, but, you know, George Soros had to do it to survive.
[01:57:05.370 --> 01:57:17.098]  If I was 15 years old and people said, help us round up a couple thousand Jews, or anybody else, we're gonna shoot you in the head, I'd play along with it only long enough to get their rifle and shoot them.
[01:57:19.764 --> 01:57:23.965]  I just don't get that whole thing, and it's the same deal.
[01:57:24.326 --> 01:57:27.767]  George Soros is an evil, opportunist, piece of crap.
[01:57:27.787 --> 01:57:36.129]  All right, we're going to come right back with more calls, and we've got a congressman joining us dealing with the whole release of the memo and so much more in the third hour.
[01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:37.990]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:41.151]  If you're listening to local affiliates, please tell people about the show.
[01:57:41.211 --> 01:57:41.611]  It's key.
[01:57:50.279 --> 01:57:52.821]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Colt in Kansas.
[01:57:53.181 --> 01:57:53.882]  Colt, you're on the air.
[01:57:53.982 --> 01:57:55.983]  So, I got a couple things I want to talk about.
[01:57:56.283 --> 01:58:00.587]  I'm from, actually, Clearwater, Kansas, and I grew up on a ranch and stuff.
[01:58:00.747 --> 01:58:02.268]  We bale our own hay and stuff.
[01:58:02.288 --> 01:58:04.649]  Clean stalls, you know, all the way through my childhood.
[01:58:04.689 --> 01:58:06.471]  You can shed a buck, you can run a trot line.
[01:58:06.511 --> 01:58:06.911]  That's right.
[01:58:07.011 --> 01:58:13.256]  So, as I've got older now, when I bale hay every year, my sinuses just go nuts after the second and third day.
[01:58:13.336 --> 01:58:14.817]  Well, I heard about your caveman
[01:58:15.157 --> 01:58:15.277]  Wow.
[01:58:34.073 --> 01:58:41.237]  You know, it's funny you say that, because I, from time to time, go read the reviews, and people have talked about reduced allergies, and, look, here's the deal.
[01:58:41.257 --> 01:58:45.119]  They give you a bowl of chicken soup, and everybody knows it's been associated with getting well quicker.
[01:58:45.179 --> 01:58:48.000]  This is hundreds of times stronger per serving.
[01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:52.263]  It's concentrated, organic chicken bone with chaga mushroom.
[01:58:53.243 --> 01:58:56.905]  Bee pollen, and a bunch of stuff that is actually known to be anti-inflammatory.
[01:58:57.525 --> 01:58:59.306]  But we put it in there because it's an antioxidant.
[01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:02.047]  And so, I mean, it really is an insane formula.
[01:59:02.248 --> 01:59:13.293]  I saw, three or four years ago, that the biggest, hottest thing in bodybuilding, and in the Olympic athletes, and in NFL players, but also folks who wanted to detoxify, and for weight loss as well, depending on how you want to use it, would be bone broth.
[01:59:13.433 --> 01:59:16.095]  Boiling down chicken bones, boiling down beef bones.
[01:59:16.275 --> 01:59:17.236]  But beef can have some issues.
[01:59:17.256 --> 01:59:17.956]  We went with chicken.
[01:59:18.056 --> 01:59:28.363]  And that for your bones, your cartilage, your energy, if you remember to just take a scoop of it with your milk or mix it with whey like I do so it tastes good, it's crazy how good these products are.
[01:59:28.383 --> 01:59:39.370]  So I didn't mean to go into a whole other plug about it, but if people just try this Ultimate Bone Broth Formula, they will see for themselves what it does within a week or so.
[01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:40.551]  So thank you for the plug, my friend.
[01:59:40.571 --> 01:59:40.911]  It is.
[01:59:41.091 --> 01:59:42.753]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:59:42.813 --> 01:59:43.173]  I love it.
[01:59:48.365 --> 01:59:52.466]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:52.986 --> 01:59:54.326]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.509 --> 02:00:11.650]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:00:12.410 --> 02:00:13.670]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.905 --> 02:00:18.346]  Well, he's a freshman congressman, but he's on fire.
[02:00:19.207 --> 02:00:23.769]  And really at the center, along with Trey Gowdy and others, exposing the Clinton Crime Network.
[02:00:24.229 --> 02:00:26.390]  Matt Gaetz joins us from Florida.
[02:00:26.690 --> 02:00:28.912]  He's in Congress right now, coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:28.932 --> 02:00:30.572]  But I wanted to play these two clips right now.
[02:00:30.592 --> 02:00:33.494]  But after Gaetz leaves, I'll go back to all the phone calls.
[02:00:34.704 --> 02:00:42.806]  I wanted to play campaigners chant, Churchill was a racist, as they storm a cafe that is themed after Churchill.
[02:00:43.446 --> 02:00:53.369]  The leftists have all these things for Mao and Lenin and Stalin that killed together about 120 million people, but Mao's 80 plus million of that, the grand champion of mass murder.
[02:00:55.336 --> 02:00:57.017]  But it's all about them bullying everybody.
[02:00:57.037 --> 02:01:01.318]  When Churchill stood against Hitler, you name it, it's just crazy.
[02:01:02.139 --> 02:01:04.540]  But again, they hate anything British, anything sovereign.
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:11.382]  And then after that, college students hate Trump's State of the Union before they've done it from the great folks at College Reform.
[02:01:11.662 --> 02:01:19.706]  So here is first Churchill, then the College Reform piece, then we'll come back with Congressman Gates with the latest on the memo, the FBI director stepping down, and more.
[02:01:19.726 --> 02:01:20.146]  Stay with us.
[02:01:21.277 --> 02:01:24.901]  We cannot accept the unashamed colonial and gentrifying presence of this cafe.
[02:01:24.921 --> 02:01:27.104]  We demand that.
[02:01:27.424 --> 02:01:37.817]  To the owner of the cafe, apologize to the local community for their poorly thought and insensitive branding and promptly change it from the menu to the aesthetics and decor of the cafe.
[02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:43.721]  To the customer, we ask you that you boycott this cafe until they take the concerns of the community seriously.
[02:01:43.981 --> 02:01:46.122]  It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
[02:01:46.282 --> 02:01:47.443]  It is our duty to win.
[02:01:47.503 --> 02:01:50.845]  We must love and support each other.
[02:01:50.865 --> 02:01:54.108]  We have nothing to lose but our chains.
[02:01:54.328 --> 02:01:58.471]  It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
[02:01:58.691 --> 02:02:00.292]  It is our duty to win.
[02:02:06.636 --> 02:02:09.599]  We must love and support each other.
[02:02:09.659 --> 02:02:12.341]  We have nothing to lose by our chains.
[02:02:12.381 --> 02:02:14.343]  We have nothing to lose by our chains.
[02:02:14.423 --> 02:02:16.445]  We have nothing to lose by our chains.
[02:02:16.525 --> 02:02:18.507]  We have nothing to lose by our chains.
[02:02:18.627 --> 02:02:20.669]  We have nothing to lose by our chains.
[02:02:20.809 --> 02:02:22.771]  We have nothing to lose by our chains.
[02:02:25.954 --> 02:02:27.334]  I'm Kevin Phillips with Campus Reform.
[02:02:27.794 --> 02:02:31.515]  Today we're at NYU getting students' opinions on President Trump's State of the Union address.
[02:02:32.075 --> 02:02:34.636]  Except that speech won't happen for another seven days.
[02:02:35.076 --> 02:02:37.437]  But what will they say when we ask them what they thought of it?
[02:02:37.857 --> 02:02:38.317]  Let's find out.
[02:02:38.757 --> 02:02:41.378]  Well, we've been getting people's reactions today to the State of the Union last night.
[02:02:41.758 --> 02:02:45.298]  Some people were saying that it was the most racist State of the Union that's ever happened.
[02:02:45.719 --> 02:02:47.219]  What was your reaction to everything that was said?
[02:02:47.739 --> 02:02:49.780]  I didn't watch it because I couldn't bring myself to watch it.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.681]  Quite racist, at the very least.
[02:02:53.022 --> 02:02:55.184]  If not up there with most racists.
[02:02:55.604 --> 02:02:55.764]  Wow.
[02:02:56.124 --> 02:02:58.205]  It's already quickly climbing the scale.
[02:02:58.586 --> 02:03:05.210]  Some of the people said today that they thought his immigration stance that he outlined last night was especially hateful.
[02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:06.090]  Very offensive.
[02:03:06.710 --> 02:03:07.431]  What do you think of that?
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:13.743]  It's something that I wouldn't have expected to happen in our lifetime.
[02:03:13.963 --> 02:03:14.664]  It's offensive.
[02:03:15.184 --> 02:03:18.948]  It is crazy, but I'm not shocked by what he's done in the past.
[02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:28.696]  I believe what I'm hearing about his rough nature and the hate that he probably said.
[02:03:28.716 --> 02:03:34.702]  He told the Democrats the wall got 10 feet higher because they didn't stand up and give him applause at one point.
[02:03:35.202 --> 02:03:36.043]  What do you think of all that?
[02:03:38.507 --> 02:03:42.570]  It's the behavior of someone who refuses to accept accountability for their failures.
[02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:47.133]  The way he acts, you shouldn't be acting like that if you're the leader of the country regardless of what party you're in.
[02:03:47.413 --> 02:03:49.354]  So that, that frustrates me a lot.
[02:03:49.794 --> 02:03:53.417]  I mean it doesn't surprise me that that was his State of the Union address.
[02:03:53.797 --> 02:03:56.499]  Hopefully everything that he's outlined can
[02:03:57.967 --> 02:03:59.307]  Be overturned by the public opinion.
[02:03:59.487 --> 02:04:02.348]  Was there any one thing in particular that you saw people most upset about?
[02:04:03.428 --> 02:04:07.089]  Probably with immigration going on with the whole DACA thing and him trying to build the wall.
[02:04:07.289 --> 02:04:12.270]  One of the craziest moments when he started a build-the-wall chant with all the Republicans that were there.
[02:04:12.750 --> 02:04:17.211]  People on social media were accusing him of basically using the State of the Union as a campaign event.
[02:04:17.251 --> 02:04:18.531]  Yeah, that's kind of ridiculous.
[02:04:18.771 --> 02:04:20.131]  I think it's absolutely crazy.
[02:04:20.191 --> 02:04:24.052]  The fact that he started a chant, he's big on those.
[02:04:24.452 --> 02:04:25.032]  What's your reaction?
[02:04:25.112 --> 02:04:29.415]  I think it reveals that he has the temperament of a three-year-old.
[02:04:29.795 --> 02:04:36.618]  People, a lot of times, they're trying to say, don't listen to what he's saying, and they just want to shut it down just because it's Trump saying it.
[02:04:36.638 --> 02:04:38.059]  Do you think they have any ground there?
[02:04:39.019 --> 02:04:39.520]  I don't think so.
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:45.062]  I think there are enough progressive and intellectual people that really analyze what he's saying.
[02:04:45.082 --> 02:04:48.504]  Do you think he's going to follow through with the things that he promised last night?
[02:04:50.025 --> 02:04:50.405]  I don't know.
[02:04:50.445 --> 02:04:50.905]  We'll see.
[02:04:51.686 --> 02:04:53.107]  He said he was going to become president.
[02:04:53.147 --> 02:04:53.787]  He became president.
[02:04:56.707 --> 02:05:05.393]  Hey, did you know that you can now preserve your own food for up to 25 years and still maintain its nutrition and flavor?
[02:05:05.453 --> 02:05:05.933]  That's right.
[02:05:05.993 --> 02:05:10.996]  Now's the time to build your own food storage with Harvest Right's freeze dryers.
[02:05:11.257 --> 02:05:17.681]  Go to infowarsstore.com to learn more and check out this innovative and smart technology that's easy to use,
[02:05:17.921 --> 02:05:25.222]  And let me tell you, son, it is perfect for freeze-drying fruits, vegetables, meats, dairy products, desserts, and entire meals.
[02:05:25.502 --> 02:05:25.702]  Woo!
[02:05:25.762 --> 02:05:26.663]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:05:26.783 --> 02:05:35.384]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[02:05:35.524 --> 02:05:43.626]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.
[02:05:45.106 --> 02:05:48.447]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[02:05:48.547 --> 02:05:52.528]  Harvest Right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer.
[02:05:52.668 --> 02:05:53.588]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:05:53.748 --> 02:05:56.389]  Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:57.569 --> 02:06:02.550]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.232 --> 02:06:10.232]  All right, my friends.
[02:06:11.412 --> 02:06:13.533]  We are now into our number three.
[02:06:16.571 --> 02:06:17.352]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:17.392 --> 02:06:18.813]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:19.493 --> 02:06:39.590]  There's an ongoing press conference right now dealing with the stepping down five months earlier than he said he would of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who we know now was the leaker, according to Ritz Privis, of secret information to the press while he was meeting with the president to deal with leaks that were violating national security.
[02:06:39.610 --> 02:06:40.731]  That is just huge.
[02:06:42.017 --> 02:06:57.886]  As this whole house of cards comes down, and I gotta tell you, it has been folks in Congress, like the Chairman Devin Nunes, and people like Trey Gowdy, and people like Jim Jordan, who have been leading the charge against this incredible bullying.
[02:06:58.167 --> 02:07:08.693]  And we're very thankful for President Trump and the American people being awake and seeing through the Russia collusion canard that tries to violate our election, and what the people have done, the will of the people.
[02:07:10.814 --> 02:07:15.367]  Without these congressmen up there telling the truth, there would be nobody out there.
[02:07:15.688 --> 02:07:17.433]  And the leftist media has pointed this out.
[02:07:17.894 --> 02:07:18.857]  But out of the gates!
[02:07:20.452 --> 02:07:32.699]  Pun intended, Matt Gaetz from Florida has been one of the strongest, most focused, eloquent, on target voices who we've all watched on Fox News, CNN, MSNBC doing battle.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:43.006]  He's got a statement out on the Deputy Director, Acting Director stepping down and so much more on the eve of the vote here on the memo and so much more.
[02:07:43.246 --> 02:07:45.067]  So Congressman Matt Gaetz, thank you for joining us.
[02:07:45.927 --> 02:07:46.688]  Good to be with you, Alex.
[02:07:47.981 --> 02:07:50.503]  Wow, what a time to be alive seeing all this.
[02:07:50.803 --> 02:07:51.563]  Where should we start?
[02:07:51.624 --> 02:07:53.245]  With McCabe?
[02:07:53.325 --> 02:07:55.426]  Or with the vote tonight on the memo?
[02:07:55.446 --> 02:07:56.387]  I mean, so much is happening.
[02:07:57.315 --> 02:08:03.997]  Well, I think we've got a lot of momentum in the Congress to get this memo released and before the American people, and that's absolutely essential.
[02:08:04.077 --> 02:08:12.480]  We've got to decide as a country what kind of government we want to have, what individual liberties protected by our Constitution are worthy of fighting for.
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:17.102]  I think it's also important for the FBI to move on past the era of Andrew McCabe.
[02:08:18.102 --> 02:08:19.162]  I wish him the best.
[02:08:19.622 --> 02:08:24.504]  I certainly don't hope anything bad happens to him going forward, but I absolutely think that
[02:08:24.784 --> 02:08:32.674]  The FBI and the Department of Justice had become so politicized that they had lost their way and they lost the confidence of the American people.
[02:08:32.714 --> 02:08:36.139]  And now we've got to rebuild that through reforms and transparency.
[02:08:36.159 --> 02:08:40.204]  And I think the first thing we can do in the Congress is vote to release this memo.
[02:08:42.526 --> 02:08:44.768]  I mean, obviously you and others have seen parts of the memo.
[02:08:44.788 --> 02:08:46.168]  You've talked to people that have seen the memo.
[02:08:46.789 --> 02:08:50.872]  I saw Trey Gowdy on Fox News last night getting that it's more than a memo.
[02:08:50.912 --> 02:08:53.974]  It's a compendium of the research of the chain of events.
[02:08:53.994 --> 02:08:57.096]  Can you speak to that and what those chain of events basically are?
[02:08:57.116 --> 02:09:07.683]  I mean, it's pretty clear you've got a cabal of Clintonites inside of the Justice Department and the FBI who wanted to stop him becoming president, stop him being even elected.
[02:09:07.703 --> 02:09:12.366]  And it looks like they even went more crazy once he was elected to try to basically stop him
[02:09:12.866 --> 02:09:22.169]  Yeah, I can say that the period of time covered in the memo deals with time both before and after the 2016 presidential election.
[02:09:22.549 --> 02:09:39.654]  One would not have to read the memo to even hold the views you hold because there's so much information that's in the public square about the text messages between Peter Strzok and Misa Page about, you know, the special status that Hillary Clinton received when she was being investigated.
[02:09:40.674 --> 02:10:08.180]  But really the way in which intelligence has been collected and the manner in which that intelligence was authenticated I think is worthy of a debate in the Congress because we need to ensure that we don't have an empowerment of these institutions linked to political organizations in a way that allows something like something so important like the FBI or the Department of Justice to be converted into a political, just a political
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:09.040]  That's
[02:10:31.810 --> 02:10:37.316]  Is being advertised the president as the new director and a great guy when he's the guy it looks like running the cabal.
[02:10:37.336 --> 02:10:42.442]  I understand you're not out in some vendetta after McCabe but doesn't this all have to come out?
[02:10:42.482 --> 02:10:46.347]  I mean we're hearing there's a lot of even bigger smoking guns that are about to come out.
[02:10:47.167 --> 02:10:48.208]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:10:48.668 --> 02:10:51.929]  This memo is not the last piece of evidence in the story.
[02:10:52.329 --> 02:10:59.193]  It's an important gathering of the evidence and it's a laying out of the evidence, but it certainly doesn't cover all periods of time.
[02:10:59.733 --> 02:11:07.056]  And you know, I can say generally as it relates to the FISA laws, there are original applications for FISA warrants.
[02:11:07.396 --> 02:11:13.580]  And then the law requires those FISA warrants to be renewed every 90 days based on the information collected.
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:25.067]  So I think that we've got to have a very broad view of the evidence and the full time period before evaluating what reforms we would make in the Congress to this process to ensure it doesn't happen again.
[02:11:25.087 --> 02:11:29.570]  And, you know, you mentioned Mr. McCabe as a central figure in so much of what went on.
[02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:35.333]  That has come out by looking at the text messages of, you know, of Peter Strzok,
[02:11:35.333 --> 02:11:35.913]  I think so.
[02:11:56.545 --> 02:12:03.973]  I mean, that seems to be an entirely reasonable review of the facts to look at the communications between people who have central roles in the investigation.
[02:12:04.254 --> 02:12:12.983]  And I don't think there's any dispute that there was extreme bias, but not only bias in their minds, in their actions, in their planning, in the things that they were doing.
[02:12:13.424 --> 02:12:16.928]  And it's one of the reasons why I filed legislation today.
[02:12:17.348 --> 02:12:19.170]  Congressman Gates, that should have been my first question.
[02:12:38.164 --> 02:12:53.799]  I think, just knowing the Republicans control the House and seem positive overall, that this vote this afternoon is going to pass, hopefully, and then any word on how fast the President, who gets to review that, because it would be great for him to review it and then talk about it at the State of the Union tomorrow.
[02:12:54.844 --> 02:13:03.151]  Yeah, I mean, he gets five days in which to review the vote of the Intelligence Committee, and he can make an objection during those five days, but I don't expect him to.
[02:13:03.171 --> 02:13:05.113]  You know what I think would be very interesting, Alex?
[02:13:05.173 --> 02:13:16.803]  If during the State of the Union, the President announced that he was supportive of the release of this memo following the Intelligence Committee's potential vote this evening, I think that would be just fantastic.
[02:13:16.843 --> 02:13:19.385]  It would be great for the country to see the President
[02:13:19.745 --> 02:13:28.032]  Wanting to bring this matter to a close, but also wanting the American people to have a look behind the curtain and see what's really going on in this country.
[02:13:28.212 --> 02:13:30.854]  It's the kind of populism that got Donald Trump elected.
[02:13:31.334 --> 02:13:36.859]  Always fighting for the regular folks, and I think we're going to hear a lot of that in the State of the Union, and this would be a really great component piece.
[02:13:37.179 --> 02:13:40.602]  Well, MSM's going to attack you for coming on the show, but that's a bad genre.
[02:13:40.622 --> 02:13:41.883]  It's like the President's come on before.
[02:13:42.803 --> 02:13:51.348]  Because they're so discredited, and after their whole Russiagate facade falls, which I think has really already fallen, you can correct me if I'm wrong, where are they gonna go from here?
[02:13:51.589 --> 02:14:09.640]  I mean, they have the fake dossier, BuzzFeed, all this stuff they do, the fake news, and then now it turns out that the conspiracy was FBI and Justice Department collusion to try to stop him from getting the nomination, stop him being seated as president, and now remove him from office when it's Hillary and all them up in their eyeballs with the Russian collusion.
[02:14:10.836 --> 02:14:18.838]  Honestly, Alex, that is a great question because I think we've won the argument with the American people as it relates to how conflicted the Mueller probe is.
[02:14:18.898 --> 02:14:28.241]  I mean, even Harvard University put out a poll that said over half of Americans think that the Mueller probe is infected with conflict of interest and, you know, Harvard usually leans pretty far to the left.
[02:14:28.261 --> 02:14:28.441]  56%, yeah.
[02:14:29.645 --> 02:14:32.168]  Yeah, but I'll tell you this, Alex.
[02:14:32.768 --> 02:14:36.532]  The mainstream media has to find ways to divide us, and so does the political left.
[02:14:36.932 --> 02:14:49.705]  Because if we focus on a growing economy, tax cuts, a regulatory environment that's working for the American people again, I think that the people will be uplifted by this Trump presidency and by Republican control of the Congress.
[02:14:49.745 --> 02:14:51.186]  And the mainstream media doesn't want to
[02:14:51.386 --> 02:14:52.527]  That was my next question.
[02:14:52.587 --> 02:15:00.175]  When clearly globalist policies have their foot on the neck of the country, Trump and you and others have just removed the foot and we're roaring back to life.
[02:15:00.495 --> 02:15:08.883]  How can the Grammys tanking, the NFL tanking, Hillary, all this keep running on hating Trump when clearly he's pro-America, clearly you are.
[02:15:08.903 --> 02:15:11.486]  I mean, people aren't going to go against their own interest.
[02:15:12.492 --> 02:15:16.134]  No, and that's why there has to be a constant distraction, right?
[02:15:16.434 --> 02:15:41.626]  So we're about to have this immigration debate, and look, I mean, there are elements of the president's blueprint that I like regarding border security, there are elements that I don't love, but I suspect that the mainstream media, the political left, they'll have to go play the race card, they'll have to use identity politics to divide people, and I think reasonable voices will have to emerge and say, no, we need an immigration policy that supports border security to support the rule of law in this country, and I hope the president lays that out tomorrow, Alex.
[02:15:42.046 --> 02:15:46.110]  All right, we got a little bit of time left after this quick break with Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida.
[02:15:46.130 --> 02:15:49.553]  Impressive new crop of folks that are up there with real leadership.
[02:15:49.893 --> 02:15:52.215]  This is amazing to see this country come back from the dead.
[02:15:52.436 --> 02:15:53.156]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:53.196 --> 02:15:53.657]  Stay with us.
[02:15:56.019 --> 02:15:57.820]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:02.425]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:16:03.205 --> 02:16:04.887]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[02:16:04.927 --> 02:16:07.369]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[02:16:07.409 --> 02:16:08.210]  Here is the trailer.
[02:16:08.703 --> 02:16:12.945]  You call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[02:16:13.806 --> 02:16:15.226]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[02:16:15.406 --> 02:16:23.230]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:23.871]  Who cares?
[02:16:24.691 --> 02:16:25.712]  You haven't been called.
[02:16:25.732 --> 02:16:26.792]  Go back to Univision.
[02:16:27.272 --> 02:16:29.494]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[02:16:29.574 --> 02:16:30.454]  He's very low energy.
[02:16:30.534 --> 02:16:32.095]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[02:16:35.250 --> 02:16:36.191]  Throw him out.
[02:16:36.211 --> 02:16:42.674]  Throw him out into the cold.
[02:16:42.974 --> 02:16:45.136]  Don't give him their coat.
[02:16:45.356 --> 02:16:45.776]  No coats.
[02:16:49.778 --> 02:16:53.961]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[02:16:54.001 --> 02:16:57.203]  The most dishonest human beings.
[02:16:57.243 --> 02:16:57.923]  These people right here.
[02:16:57.963 --> 02:16:59.004]  Look at all the cameras.
[02:17:03.946 --> 02:17:04.746]  So disgusting!
[02:17:04.826 --> 02:17:06.867]  This socialist slash communist!
[02:17:06.887 --> 02:17:07.347]  Crazy Bernie.
[02:17:07.387 --> 02:17:08.908]  He's crazy as it may look.
[02:17:09.208 --> 02:17:12.329]  Pocahontas?
[02:17:12.389 --> 02:17:12.849]  The Indian?
[02:17:12.869 --> 02:17:13.989]  Very offensive!
[02:17:14.109 --> 02:17:16.130]  I'm sorry about that.
[02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.550]  Pocahontas?
[02:17:18.591 --> 02:17:19.211]  Crooked Hillary!
[02:17:19.311 --> 02:17:20.292]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[02:17:20.492 --> 02:17:22.572]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[02:17:27.934 --> 02:17:28.534]  Crooked Hillary!
[02:17:28.574 --> 02:17:30.275]  Politicians are really dishonest!
[02:17:32.034 --> 02:17:36.075]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[02:17:36.095 --> 02:17:37.576]  This had nothing to do with me.
[02:17:37.596 --> 02:17:40.877]  Except I might have pointed it out.
[02:17:41.057 --> 02:17:43.177]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[02:17:43.338 --> 02:17:45.158]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[02:17:45.178 --> 02:17:46.499]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[02:17:47.219 --> 02:17:48.759]  Because they were protecting him.
[02:17:48.899 --> 02:17:49.800]  I'm trying to be nice.
[02:17:49.840 --> 02:17:51.340]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[02:17:52.620 --> 02:17:54.221]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[02:17:54.441 --> 02:17:56.242]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[02:17:56.302 --> 02:17:57.502]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[02:17:59.218 --> 02:18:01.639]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[02:18:01.779 --> 02:18:02.499]  It just doesn't work.
[02:18:02.519 --> 02:18:04.679]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[02:18:05.780 --> 02:18:07.620]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:10.461]  He makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[02:18:11.621 --> 02:18:13.282]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[02:18:13.302 --> 02:18:17.003]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[02:18:17.283 --> 02:18:18.203]  Repeat after me.
[02:18:18.223 --> 02:18:21.044]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[02:18:21.104 --> 02:18:22.484]  That's not going to happen.
[02:18:23.004 --> 02:18:23.764]  So help me God.
[02:18:24.165 --> 02:18:25.485]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[02:18:31.582 --> 02:18:34.608]  We will make America great again!
[02:18:35.850 --> 02:18:36.892]  Go home to mommy.
[02:18:37.232 --> 02:18:38.455]  Tell her to tuck you in bed.
[02:18:38.735 --> 02:18:40.298]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[02:18:41.621 --> 02:18:42.902]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[02:18:42.922 --> 02:18:43.662]  We've carried them all.
[02:18:43.963 --> 02:18:44.583]  We sell them all.
[02:18:44.603 --> 02:18:45.344]  They're all groundbreaking.
[02:18:45.364 --> 02:18:47.145]  But this one, this one is fun.
[02:18:47.805 --> 02:18:49.066]  And very, very celebratory.
[02:18:49.106 --> 02:18:51.648]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[02:18:51.668 --> 02:18:52.509]  It's really a special film.
[02:18:53.589 --> 02:18:54.070]  Thanks a lot.
[02:18:54.090 --> 02:18:58.913]  Look, I urge everyone, you've got to get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[02:18:59.694 --> 02:19:02.395]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[02:19:03.016 --> 02:19:05.718]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[02:19:06.278 --> 02:19:18.784]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:22.245]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[02:19:22.285 --> 02:19:23.266]  That's why it stuck.
[02:19:23.486 --> 02:19:28.508]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[02:19:28.648 --> 02:19:29.589]  I thought I knew Trump.
[02:19:29.689 --> 02:19:30.509]  I studied Trump.
[02:19:30.949 --> 02:19:31.669]  I thought I knew him.
[02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:34.991]  Only when you see this all back-to-back, how he reacts.
[02:19:35.571 --> 02:19:36.732]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.074 --> 02:20:22.225]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[02:20:22.525 --> 02:20:24.329]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.529 --> 02:20:26.413]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:20:28.007 --> 02:20:30.289]  All right, I gotta say, rising star of the Republican Party.
[02:20:30.409 --> 02:20:33.872]  I know that he's one of my favorite people to watch on Fox News or even on CNN.
[02:20:34.132 --> 02:20:36.194]  Got five minutes left with Matt Gaetz.
[02:20:36.314 --> 02:20:37.695]  MattGaetz.com.
[02:20:37.775 --> 02:20:39.557]  Gaetz spelled G-A-E-T-Z.
[02:20:39.897 --> 02:20:40.578]  MattGaetz.com.
[02:20:40.618 --> 02:20:43.060]  You can follow him on Twitter, all the rest of it, and that's critical.
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:45.602]  We had a great discussion during that three and a half minute break.
[02:20:46.383 --> 02:20:47.263]  Let's just go through it.
[02:20:47.804 --> 02:20:49.866]  What happens as their house of cards falls?
[02:20:49.906 --> 02:20:51.247]  They've shown they never give up.
[02:20:53.149 --> 02:21:01.331]  Well, you're right about that, Alex, but they're going to be like cornered rats when this entire investigation is shown to be the fraud that it is.
[02:21:01.411 --> 02:21:09.273]  It's built on a rotten foundation, and I suspect that they'll have to go into major defense mode over Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.
[02:21:09.293 --> 02:21:20.435]  There's a lot of people that paid bribes to the Clinton Foundation that still may be getting a benefit out of this government, and when they find out that their house of cards is falling, we may see a very strong reaction.
[02:21:27.161 --> 02:21:27.581]  That's right.
[02:21:27.661 --> 02:21:31.385]  No lobbyists in there, and that's why they're panicking.
[02:21:31.405 --> 02:21:32.466]  2018, they say, is everything.
[02:21:32.506 --> 02:21:39.452]  We secured the beachhead like Normandy, but we've got to actually go into Germany here to use that World War II analogy.
[02:21:39.472 --> 02:21:39.992]  So let's talk about 2018.
[02:21:41.803 --> 02:21:48.285]  Well, Trump voters have to have a reason to come out and vote for Republicans in a world in which Donald Trump's not going to be on the ballot, Alex.
[02:21:48.625 --> 02:21:51.987]  And so the question is, will Republicans stand by the Trump agenda?
[02:21:52.247 --> 02:21:56.708]  Will we help this president get major things accomplished like we did on tax reform?
[02:21:57.188 --> 02:21:58.569]  Or in this next year, is it going to be
[02:21:58.649 --> 02:22:07.754]  More like the Obamacare fiasco, where unfortunately we weren't able to do that because of some people in the Senate, primarily Republicans, abandoning this president.
[02:22:07.794 --> 02:22:17.880]  And so I think that if we stand behind our standard bearer, if we fight for his agenda, for a stronger border, for infrastructure, for tax cuts, we'll see this economy take off and Trump voters will come out.
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:24.604]  If we see more of like what we see out of Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and sometimes Mitch McConnell,
[02:22:24.944 --> 02:22:27.552]  That I fear we may be in for a real tough cycle.
[02:22:27.612 --> 02:22:28.976]  So it's all to us.
[02:22:29.076 --> 02:22:31.904]  We have the power to control our destiny if we'll fight with this president.
[02:22:32.557 --> 02:22:33.017]  Well, that's right.
[02:22:33.057 --> 02:22:34.078]  The left is bragging.
[02:22:34.158 --> 02:22:37.139]  Okay, libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, populists, they woke up.
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:39.321]  They're taking over worldwide, but it doesn't matter.
[02:22:39.421 --> 02:22:42.622]  Now we've mobilized, and they're really stealing elections.
[02:22:42.662 --> 02:22:44.403]  They are boiling out of their rat holes.
[02:22:44.984 --> 02:22:47.245]  People need to know, hey, this was just phase one.
[02:22:47.265 --> 02:22:48.265]  It's kind of like a football game.
[02:22:48.525 --> 02:22:52.948]  We've won the first half, and now we're coming out of the bunkers here.
[02:22:53.308 --> 02:22:55.129]  This is the real fight here in the second half.
[02:22:56.092 --> 02:23:03.755]  No, you're absolutely right, because if we lose the House, Nancy Pelosi will have Donald Trump impeached by this House within 90 days of taking the gavel.
[02:23:04.135 --> 02:23:06.897]  I firmly believe that, and so that's why the House is so important.
[02:23:07.177 --> 02:23:17.081]  And then in the Senate, we find too often that there's this sense of collegiality and deference to one another that really erodes democracy, erodes majority rule.
[02:23:17.101 --> 02:23:19.502]  I think we need a new voice in the huddle in the Senate.
[02:23:19.522 --> 02:23:22.303]  I think that we need some leaders in the United States Senate to stand up and
[02:23:22.483 --> 02:23:25.644]  Fight for this president's agenda and fight for conservative reform.
[02:23:25.924 --> 02:23:29.724]  They did that on tax cuts and I think that they should be commended for it.
[02:23:30.045 --> 02:23:35.826]  Now let's get back and start working on some of these entitlements that are hollowing out the economic future of this country.
[02:23:35.886 --> 02:23:37.966]  Let's get back and actually secure the border.
[02:23:38.226 --> 02:23:39.466]  Let's do E-Verify.
[02:23:39.506 --> 02:23:40.907]  Let's end chain migration.
[02:23:41.527 --> 02:23:44.528]  I think if we can get a Senate behind those priorities, we'll have a great 2018.
[02:23:45.208 --> 02:23:51.569]  But if they fail to do the conservative things we promised to our voters, then I suspect voters who are Trump fans
[02:23:51.909 --> 02:23:53.990]  May not come out for the election, but you're right.
[02:23:54.170 --> 02:23:55.810]  It's critically important to get the agenda done.
[02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:59.031]  I gotta say, I'm not a cheerleader, I'm a cheerleader for the truth.
[02:23:59.411 --> 02:24:01.011]  Trump has over-delivered in one year.
[02:24:01.071 --> 02:24:03.812]  He did more than Reagan ever did in three or four, and I love Reagan.
[02:24:04.212 --> 02:24:05.492]  I mean, it was dramatic.
[02:24:05.752 --> 02:24:06.712]  They call it gridlock.
[02:24:06.752 --> 02:24:08.053]  He ran over the gridlock.
[02:24:08.093 --> 02:24:14.754]  I mean, all the things we got, procedurally wounding Obamacare, the tax cuts, the border, taking care of the military.
[02:24:14.874 --> 02:24:17.675]  I mean, all the things we've seen, the jobs, the stock market.
[02:24:18.335 --> 02:24:23.477]  If America doesn't double down and realize Trump's got our back, we've got to get his back, we deserve what happens.
[02:24:23.597 --> 02:24:26.437]  In closing, the minute we've got left, Congressman Gates from Florida.
[02:24:27.238 --> 02:24:27.878]  State of the Union.
[02:24:28.218 --> 02:24:30.119]  We've seen year one about delivering.
[02:24:30.399 --> 02:24:32.019]  Trump says, hey, I've just got it started.
[02:24:32.559 --> 02:24:34.620]  What do you expect to hear in the State of the Union tomorrow night?
[02:24:35.986 --> 02:24:38.689]  I expect the President to offer a unifying message.
[02:24:38.749 --> 02:24:54.204]  I expect a real focus on infrastructure and about the economic conditions people find themselves in because the mainstream media can lie and they can cheat and they can distort and they can take things out of context and sensationalize all kind of drama that goes on here in Washington.
[02:24:54.545 --> 02:24:58.569]  But what the mainstream media can't lie about is the amount of money in people's paychecks.
[02:24:59.029 --> 02:24:59.250]  I think?
[02:25:15.325 --> 02:25:15.765]  That's right.
[02:25:15.845 --> 02:25:18.467]  It's really a question of if the people are awake, they should deliver and take action.
[02:25:18.507 --> 02:25:19.667]  I've got to ask this last question.
[02:25:20.048 --> 02:25:27.051]  I know you're not a vindictive guy and neither am I. Napoleon got sent off to Alba, but Hillary and the globalists have committed all these crimes.
[02:25:27.331 --> 02:25:28.652]  There should be more investigations.
[02:25:28.692 --> 02:25:29.432]  Something should be done.
[02:25:29.652 --> 02:25:31.133]  They're always going to come back if we don't.
[02:25:31.413 --> 02:25:38.817]  Is somebody going to get indicted over the made-up Russiagate crimes, trying to frustrate voters, and all the crazy stuff we've seen?
[02:25:40.919 --> 02:25:44.144]  The former FBI director McCabe's wife getting a half million.
[02:25:44.365 --> 02:25:45.387]  The president's talked about it.
[02:25:45.627 --> 02:25:46.909]  What needs to happen just in closing?
[02:25:47.657 --> 02:26:01.924]  Well, there have been credible media reports that the Little Rock field office is actually investigating elements of bribery and corruption with the Clinton Foundation, particularly as it relates to uranium sales that may not have been in our nation's interest.
[02:26:02.204 --> 02:26:15.150]  And I think that should really worry Hillary Clinton and some of the people who were paying money for influence within the Clinton world, because this is not going to be a politically predetermined outcome made by a bunch of political bureaucrats
[02:26:15.230 --> 02:26:15.310]  Wow.
[02:26:15.370 --> 02:26:18.373]  So it looks like Clinton world is coming to an end as America and the real world comes back.
[02:26:18.393 --> 02:26:18.493]  Wow.
[02:26:18.513 --> 02:26:20.295]  Matt Gaetz, really impressed with what you're doing.
[02:26:20.315 --> 02:26:20.575]  MattGaetz.com.
[02:26:20.595 --> 02:26:22.998]  Thanks for joining us here in the InfoWarp.
[02:26:37.725 --> 02:26:38.165]  Thank you.
[02:26:38.726 --> 02:26:40.827]  All right, there goes the congressman.
[02:26:41.208 --> 02:26:42.389]  Thank you so much, Congressman.
[02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.689]  Wow.
[02:26:42.929 --> 02:26:43.750]  MattGaetz.com.
[02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:47.372]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:26:47.392 --> 02:26:54.698]  We're going to go to break here in just a few minutes, but I tell you, I remember Stone a couple of years ago and Matt Gaetz, Matt Gaetz, we're running him for Congress.
[02:26:54.758 --> 02:26:55.859]  Oh, he's the best, blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:56.139 --> 02:26:56.760]  You're going to love him.
[02:26:56.780 --> 02:26:58.261]  This guy's going to be a hard charger.
[02:26:58.301 --> 02:27:01.543]  This guy's going to be, you watch this guy and boom, there it is.
[02:27:01.623 --> 02:27:03.565]  I mean, it's just like amazing.
[02:27:04.105 --> 02:27:14.374]  And that is not the congressman that I talked to about the memos two weeks ago, or Jack Buscema that talked to another congressman, or Roger Stone that had dinner with three congressmen to tell you what was in the memo.
[02:27:14.755 --> 02:27:24.083]  And again, you're talking to people, writing notes like, okay, it's the memo, okay, it does this, okay, it's a blueprint, it's a roadmap to all the stuff they've done, it proves perjury in the general FISA memo.
[02:27:25.416 --> 02:27:32.398]  And then all of a sudden, a week later, William Benning, the former technical head of the NSA, goes, oh, this document, no one's paid attention, this is the memo.
[02:27:32.638 --> 02:27:33.359]  And it is the memo.
[02:27:34.379 --> 02:27:42.401]  And then it's part of the larger memo they're writing about the FISA court that then nexuses them all in with that into how they perjured themselves.
[02:27:43.402 --> 02:27:44.282]  And I have trouble.
[02:27:44.322 --> 02:27:46.443]  It's a big investigation, getting my mind around that.
[02:27:46.483 --> 02:27:47.823]  But I mean, it's crystal clear.
[02:27:48.303 --> 02:27:50.684]  But again, then they play semantical games about what's in it.
[02:27:52.526 --> 02:27:53.386]  It's gonna destroy them.
[02:27:53.946 --> 02:28:06.171]  And that's why my spidey sense, I could barely sleep last night, even though I was a good boy and tried to go to bed early and everything, I rolled around a bunch, woke up in the middle of the night, was doing research for three hours, and I only can't sleep when big stuff's about to happen.
[02:28:06.191 --> 02:28:08.932]  Because man, we're relaunching the republic right now.
[02:28:10.312 --> 02:28:15.414]  We are, and again, it doesn't mean I'm perfect or you're perfect, but we're not out to hurt you.
[02:28:15.794 --> 02:28:19.035]  My intent is justice and prosperity.
[02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:24.113]  Doesn't mean I've got to suppress some of my evil side sometimes when people are messing with me.
[02:28:24.977 --> 02:28:25.860]  But, I love God.
[02:28:26.826 --> 02:28:27.667]  And I know I'm a sinner.
[02:28:28.187 --> 02:28:28.807]  That's the difference.
[02:28:28.827 --> 02:28:30.168]  These people don't even know they're evil.
[02:28:30.188 --> 02:28:33.050]  They're just running wild, like foaming at the mouth about everything.
[02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:35.451]  And it just gets worse and worse and crazier and crazier.
[02:28:35.471 --> 02:28:36.812]  Because they're megalomaniacs.
[02:28:36.852 --> 02:28:37.773]  They have no governors.
[02:28:38.313 --> 02:28:39.434]  Because they're not powerful.
[02:28:40.315 --> 02:28:45.738]  Really innately powerful people have governors because they understand what can happen.
[02:28:45.778 --> 02:28:46.819]  But scumbags don't.
[02:28:47.059 --> 02:28:51.862]  Your calls and a ton of breaking news and clips from the news conference coming up straight ahead.

[02:29:56.161 --> 02:30:05.449]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[02:30:06.310 --> 02:30:13.676]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:30:14.357 --> 02:30:20.602]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[02:30:21.483 --> 02:30:26.747]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:30:27.348 --> 02:30:35.654]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[02:30:38.579 --> 02:30:44.803]  I started working with some of the top labs in the country many years ago, but intensely the last year, to bring out a lot of new brands.
[02:31:08.809 --> 02:31:26.020]  And I said, what is the cleanest, healthiest thing that goes after seasonal distress, the things that pollen and dust and all the trees and plants cause, but that doesn't have even herbs in it that speed up the metabolism and get you in a heightened state?
[02:31:26.040 --> 02:31:27.361]  Because sure, you're all jazzed up.
[02:31:27.381 --> 02:31:29.383]  Your body's going to ignore the fact that it's under attack.
[02:31:29.643 --> 02:31:33.725]  I said, what naturally deals with it, but helps the body in its own way actually heal it?
[02:31:34.186 --> 02:31:37.048]  And they said, well, that is Japanese quail eggs
[02:31:38.467 --> 02:31:42.710]  Type of quail, Japanese quail, fed a specific diet by the French.
[02:31:43.310 --> 02:31:44.671]  They discovered this like 40 years ago.
[02:31:44.731 --> 02:31:53.996]  It's not patented, not documented, but it's got better rates in the studies than placebos and then, you know, a lot of other products that are out there.
[02:31:54.016 --> 02:31:58.879]  So I continue to marvel at Mother Nature and what God gave us on this planet.
[02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:05.964]  Because the results we've gotten just at the office, people with serious
[02:32:07.142 --> 02:32:10.364]  Issues with pollen, with dust, hay fever, you name it.
[02:32:10.824 --> 02:32:13.666]  The results we've gotten with the pollen block have just been insane.
[02:32:14.627 --> 02:32:16.128]  And it just makes my head spin.
[02:32:16.248 --> 02:32:20.811]  Why did I not, suffering from this for so many years, not know about it?
[02:32:21.658 --> 02:32:26.260]  When it has alleviated my issues, like I said, 70%.
[02:32:26.640 --> 02:32:29.502]  I mean, it has been a game changer.
[02:32:29.562 --> 02:32:36.805]  I still sneeze some, I still might have a little burning in my sinus, but the pounding headaches, the fog is gone.
[02:32:37.625 --> 02:32:39.366]  And that's what personally happened for me.
[02:32:39.946 --> 02:32:40.807]  See what happens for you.
[02:32:40.867 --> 02:32:41.507]  Give us your review.
[02:32:41.847 --> 02:32:43.148]  We'd love to hear what you have to say.
[02:32:44.148 --> 02:32:53.091]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, Pollen Block, 51% off, out of the gates, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:32:59.414 --> 02:33:02.075]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.828 --> 02:33:29.813]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.315 --> 02:33:36.036]  You know, they say that pride goes before a fall.
[02:33:36.876 --> 02:33:37.356]  The Bible.
[02:33:38.017 --> 02:33:38.717]  And I agree with that.
[02:33:38.737 --> 02:33:41.598]  And I wouldn't call it pride.
[02:33:41.838 --> 02:33:42.879]  It's not pride in myself.
[02:33:44.949 --> 02:33:56.579]  Pride, arrogance, self-arrogance is evil, but having pride in your family, having pride in successes we've had is a celebration.
[02:33:56.979 --> 02:33:58.561]  So pride isn't the right word.
[02:33:59.942 --> 02:34:04.466]  So I don't know what you call it, but man, I'm really proud of our audience.
[02:34:06.428 --> 02:34:12.553]  And I know that sounds patronizing when I come on air and say that, but whenever these families
[02:34:15.074 --> 02:34:20.716]  Of every race, color, and creed, all the human race, come up to me and shake my hand and thank me for things.
[02:34:24.977 --> 02:34:34.280]  It's like getting punched in the stomach in that I feel like I'm not worthy to have this much attention or thanks.
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:43.543]  I took my daughters and one of their friends out with my wife to dinner Friday night at an Argentinian steakhouse.
[02:34:46.662 --> 02:34:50.385]  And then our dinner was probably pretty expensive, and somebody bought our dinner.
[02:34:50.785 --> 02:34:53.827]  That happens all the time, and I'm looking around who did it, and they're already gone.
[02:34:56.389 --> 02:35:07.197]  And it just makes me really... It's just... Because I guarantee you, the people that bought me my dinner are probably smarter than I am, more eloquent, and could even do a better job.
[02:35:07.497 --> 02:35:13.481]  All I'm saying is, all this success we have, all this power, doesn't make me feel arrogant.
[02:35:13.541 --> 02:35:14.242]  It's the opposite.
[02:35:15.708 --> 02:35:18.230]  But I do have pride in you.
[02:35:18.990 --> 02:35:21.372]  And that's why I always say to people, well, thanks for putting up with me.
[02:35:21.412 --> 02:35:24.094]  Because sometimes I tune into my own show later to re-hear it.
[02:35:24.114 --> 02:35:24.794]  I don't like doing it.
[02:35:24.814 --> 02:35:26.035]  And it's like, wow, that was really good.
[02:35:26.055 --> 02:35:30.878]  And other times I go, man, you sound like a sped up, gibbering moron.
[02:35:31.459 --> 02:35:34.641]  And all I'm saying is, I want you to know I appreciate you.
[02:35:35.922 --> 02:35:40.245]  And I was just thinking during the break about how far we've come.
[02:35:41.644 --> 02:35:47.165]  All over the world, people are waking up and taking action against these big centralized corporate combines.
[02:35:48.285 --> 02:35:51.026]  And they're taking action against all these really, really evil people.
[02:35:52.006 --> 02:35:54.946]  And Trump's taking action as best he can.
[02:35:54.986 --> 02:35:56.547]  I'm surprised he's gotten this much done.
[02:35:57.047 --> 02:35:58.527]  People can point at things that aren't perfect.
[02:35:59.727 --> 02:36:02.748]  He's not a dictator, and even if he was a dictator, that'd cause its own problems.
[02:36:02.768 --> 02:36:03.408]  We don't want that.
[02:36:07.509 --> 02:36:09.609]  It's just an amazing time to be alive right now.
[02:36:10.936 --> 02:36:11.537]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:36:12.798 --> 02:36:30.496]  And the people I've gotten to meet doing this, the things I've been through, even though I get attacked and lied about and persecuted behind the scenes, I actually get guilty that I'm so resigned, even though I love my children more than life itself.
[02:36:31.792 --> 02:36:37.016]  I love my own life as well, but not as much as I want to stop the globalists.
[02:36:37.577 --> 02:36:44.502]  Not as much as, in general, the planet isn't going to make it, and we're not going to make it as a species if we don't defeat these people.
[02:36:44.843 --> 02:36:45.683]  And that's what I'm getting at.
[02:36:48.105 --> 02:36:53.049]  That's what I'm getting at, is that it's that real feeling that's beyond a feeling.
[02:36:53.109 --> 02:36:58.634]  It's a knowing in your bones that you've got to do this no matter what.
[02:36:59.815 --> 02:37:00.855]  You've got to take action.
[02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:11.316]  You've gotta commit, you've gotta put everything, your children, your family, your life, everything on the line, or there's no future.
[02:37:11.976 --> 02:37:19.561]  Because the death of our species, the death of everything we've been through, will be the death of our ancestors, and the death of us, and the death of our progeny.
[02:37:20.301 --> 02:37:22.242]  That is the death of our species.
[02:37:24.284 --> 02:37:27.946]  And it's so clear that evil people have bought into a spirit
[02:37:29.107 --> 02:37:37.115]  It's invaded our world, as the Bible says, to try to get people to sell out, to suppress their own humans for the promise of some godhood.
[02:37:37.775 --> 02:37:53.210]  You're never going to receive this Luciferian enlightenment that you believe, this Luciferian fire that you believe is going to help you become transcendent by being selfish and by dumbing down your fellow humans.
[02:37:55.762 --> 02:37:56.642]  But that's the message.
[02:37:57.543 --> 02:38:13.990]  You gotta prove how strong you are in survival of the fittest, to do all these rough, horrible things with people, and then out of that nightmare will rise this uber-mention, when at the base level you're not trying to give rise to amazing humans, you're trying to suppress everybody.
[02:38:15.611 --> 02:38:18.492]  So that you, the fallen, can rule over us.
[02:38:18.572 --> 02:38:19.493]  It's a lie!
[02:38:20.936 --> 02:38:28.918]  They create an atmosphere to make us weak, to make us pathetic, to make us passive, to make us go along.
[02:38:28.938 --> 02:38:35.679]  And then they go, oh, we're doing all this to, you know, see what comes out of the mud, the lily.
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:49.382]  All I know is the spirit that comes out of DC, the spirit that comes out of Los Angeles, the spirit that comes out of their systems is cold, alone,
[02:38:50.666 --> 02:38:58.048]  Destitute, poverty stricken, shrunken, starving, howling, freezing dead.
[02:38:59.569 --> 02:39:03.270]  And I have tasted that spirit and I don't want any part of it.
[02:39:06.471 --> 02:39:08.352]  You know, the devil is able to masquerade.
[02:39:08.372 --> 02:39:09.192]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls.
[02:39:10.405 --> 02:39:16.890]  As this engine of life, like wild sex, and strength, and will, and talent comes out of the devil.
[02:39:16.970 --> 02:39:30.001]  No, the devil, the system takes control of your mind, and it makes you think your natural talents come from the system, when the system is there leeching off you, using you to empower its structure.
[02:39:33.063 --> 02:39:37.267]  We're gonna go to Mark, and Sam, and Marcos, and Forrest, and many others, Tim in Seattle.
[02:39:37.627 --> 02:39:39.208]  That Congressman Gates interview,
[02:39:40.154 --> 02:39:41.896]  That we just had earlier was powerful.
[02:39:41.936 --> 02:39:45.920]  I mean, he said the Clinton Crime Network are cornered rats that are going down.
[02:39:47.401 --> 02:39:59.293]  He said that there's credible reports he's got that the FBI and Little Rock is investigating the Clinton Library and Foundation.
[02:40:02.486 --> 02:40:09.753]  And that he believes they will vote to release the memo, and the President will talk about how he's going to release the memo at the State of the Union tomorrow night.
[02:40:10.133 --> 02:40:11.454]  And he's telling you what he's heard.
[02:40:11.494 --> 02:40:13.957]  He's like, he's not saying it's going to happen because the thing could change.
[02:40:13.977 --> 02:40:15.438]  He goes, I'd like to see.
[02:40:15.458 --> 02:40:17.540]  I'm like Jim Jordan.
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.066]  You know, I bet you guys went and met with McCabe and fixed all this fake made-up intelligence as a plan to have an insurance policy.
[02:40:25.851 --> 02:40:30.472]  And before this stuff had even come out, Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, was going, oh shit, talk about that.
[02:40:30.512 --> 02:40:32.393]  He's telling them, I've got the secret documents.
[02:40:32.673 --> 02:40:33.293]  They're coming out.
[02:40:33.313 --> 02:40:34.753]  What are you going to do on the hot seat?
[02:40:35.093 --> 02:40:38.594]  I mean, just to finally see, because I didn't want to get Gates on.
[02:40:38.614 --> 02:40:40.455]  They're normally getting Congress people on.
[02:40:40.475 --> 02:40:40.815]  That's boring.
[02:40:40.835 --> 02:40:41.255]  Nobody cares.
[02:40:41.275 --> 02:40:45.356]  I don't want to get Gates on and kiss his ass and say, oh my God, thank God for Jim Jordan.
[02:40:45.396 --> 02:40:46.196]  Thank God for Trey Gowdy.
[02:40:46.216 --> 02:40:47.196]  Thank God for Devin Nunes.
[02:40:47.456 --> 02:40:48.097]  Thank God for you.
[02:40:48.357 --> 02:40:49.777]  But I mean, thank God for him.
[02:40:50.077 --> 02:40:53.398]  If we didn't have those patriots that got in the Freedom Caucus,
[02:40:54.605 --> 02:41:02.191]  That are dyed-in-the-wool patriots, we wouldn't even have a shot right now with a bunch of candy-ass people out there.
[02:41:04.032 --> 02:41:05.853]  And I'm proud of the fact that I backed Rand Paul.
[02:41:06.514 --> 02:41:09.376]  He went sideways during the campaign, thought he was establishment to win.
[02:41:09.656 --> 02:41:10.897]  They knew he wasn't establishment.
[02:41:11.758 --> 02:41:12.438]  Now he's back!
[02:41:12.558 --> 02:41:12.838]  Great!
[02:41:12.939 --> 02:41:13.699]  I love Rand Paul.
[02:41:14.239 --> 02:41:16.141]  This is what this is all about, man.
[02:41:16.441 --> 02:41:17.902]  It's retaking who we are.
[02:41:17.922 --> 02:41:19.984]  And standing up and saying, listen!
[02:41:21.403 --> 02:41:23.625]  I don't have all the answers and I'm not looking for power.
[02:41:23.905 --> 02:41:25.266]  But you're not going to run my life.
[02:41:25.546 --> 02:41:26.907]  So you want to feel some power?
[02:41:27.247 --> 02:41:29.509]  I'm going to kick you like a horse upside your head!
[02:41:30.759 --> 02:41:34.302]  And then I'm going to keep coming back at you until the end because this fighting's all I got.
[02:41:34.882 --> 02:41:40.767]  I can't roll over in some ditch and show my belly to you wolves and let you pull my guts out from my rear end.
[02:41:41.307 --> 02:41:47.452]  You want to fight me, it's going to be swinging fists and I'm going to be biting and I'm going to be attacking until the last blood pumps out of that heart.
[02:41:47.472 --> 02:41:54.317]  And when my eyes roll up in my head, I'm going to be dead and you're not going to have me strapped up against some wall having your way with me.
[02:41:57.816 --> 02:42:05.762]  Like I've discovered you wanted me to be, under your control, in your hands, right there, but God delivered me one more time.
[02:42:06.342 --> 02:42:15.009]  And I'm sure, in my gut, because God's already told me, I already know it, my spirit, God tells you, this is the choices you have, that I will be made an example of.
[02:42:15.949 --> 02:42:18.952]  In the end, I will be destroyed in front of everybody.
[02:42:20.052 --> 02:42:21.173]  But that will be the victory.
[02:42:22.014 --> 02:42:25.597]  And I personally am not looking for that, but I know that's what it really takes.
[02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:31.954]  To go the long mile, to not stop, to be the winter soldier, not the sunshine patriot.
[02:42:31.974 --> 02:42:37.239]  And I'll tell you, I don't feel sorry for myself, feeling like that.
[02:42:37.679 --> 02:42:39.561]  I feel so honored it brings tears to my eyes.
[02:42:41.063 --> 02:42:43.685]  Thank God we're not with these devil worshippers and pedophiles.
[02:42:43.925 --> 02:42:45.146]  Thank God you're with God.
[02:42:45.447 --> 02:42:46.468]  Thank God you're awake.
[02:42:46.548 --> 02:42:47.569]  Thank God you're good.
[02:42:47.829 --> 02:42:49.791]  Get on your knees and thank Christ right now.
[02:42:50.091 --> 02:42:50.672]  I know I am.
[02:42:57.017 --> 02:43:01.478]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:43:01.698 --> 02:43:06.399]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:43:06.999 --> 02:43:12.820]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:25.842]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you have to absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sweet.
[02:43:26.622 --> 02:43:35.270]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:37.212]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:43:37.552 --> 02:43:38.673]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:43:38.693 --> 02:43:39.955]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:43:39.975 --> 02:43:41.356]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:43:41.476 --> 02:43:43.036]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:43:43.536 --> 02:43:45.137]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:43:45.157 --> 02:43:46.957]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:43:47.317 --> 02:43:49.918]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:43:49.958 --> 02:43:50.798]  This is insane.
[02:43:51.218 --> 02:43:52.838]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:43:53.098 --> 02:43:55.659]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:43:56.099 --> 02:43:57.619]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:43:57.659 --> 02:43:59.480]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:01.360]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:44:02.220 --> 02:44:08.142]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:44:08.402 --> 02:44:09.742]  All just moderate dose.
[02:44:11.274 --> 02:44:19.259]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:44:19.279 --> 02:44:21.680]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:22.861]  But thank you for committing.
[02:44:26.926 --> 02:44:32.732]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it, but it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:44:32.752 --> 02:44:37.517]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:44:37.997 --> 02:44:47.267]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:44:47.607 --> 02:44:48.909]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:44:58.220 --> 02:45:01.662]  What do you think of our X2, uh, you know, true atomic iodine?
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:43.229]  Iodine is essential to every cell development especially in children and iodine is concentrated in the gland where it filters the serum coming through your blood and extracts whatever iodine is present.
[02:45:43.389 --> 02:45:43.589]  If the
[02:45:43.629 --> 02:45:46.532]  The iodine is not present in sufficient numbers.
[02:45:47.113 --> 02:45:49.176]  Your thyroid gland has to work double time.
[02:45:49.296 --> 02:45:53.441]  In the extreme, it reaches the limit.
[02:45:53.501 --> 02:46:03.592]  So then the pituitary gland sends a thyroid growth hormone to it to make sure that it's bigger so you can process more serum and get more iodine from it.
[02:46:04.333 --> 02:46:04.533]  In the
[02:46:22.799 --> 02:46:30.824]  At the same time, iodine enables your cells to develop, and it's very important for muscular brain development.
[02:46:31.265 --> 02:46:36.608]  A lot of brain problems and breast cancer may be attributable to iodine deficiency.
[02:46:36.728 --> 02:46:43.873]  And by the way, you can just search engine mainstream news admits iodine deficiency on average 15 IQ point reductions, then fluoride added another 15.
[02:46:44.293 --> 02:46:45.213]  It's all admitted.
[02:46:45.253 --> 02:46:51.938]  This is a plan where they bomb us with a bad halogen that our thyroid then uses, and it basically then gives us the swollen thyroid.
[02:46:58.883 --> 02:47:05.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:11.453 --> 02:47:14.955]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:47:15.536 --> 02:47:18.858]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.958 --> 02:47:20.339]  Well, it's happened again.
[02:47:20.359 --> 02:47:22.261]  It happens every day, basically.
[02:47:22.281 --> 02:47:25.383]  An off-duty cop shoots a driver attempting to run over pedestrians.
[02:47:25.844 --> 02:47:27.125]  Philadelphia police say
[02:47:27.805 --> 02:47:32.627]  And you know if his name ends up being Durka Durka Muhammad Jahan, you're not going to see that in the media.
[02:47:32.647 --> 02:47:41.071]  A man who allegedly attempted to ram pedestrians with his black Honda on Monday morning in Philadelphia, critically injured one person before being shot and killed by an off-duty cop who happened to be on the scene.
[02:47:41.491 --> 02:47:44.952]  The driver who was not immediately identified was taken to Presbyterian Medical Center.
[02:47:45.333 --> 02:47:46.333]  The gunshot wound to the head.
[02:47:46.353 --> 02:47:48.474]  He was pronounced dead soon after arriving.
[02:47:50.023 --> 02:47:50.163]  Too bad.
[02:47:50.183 --> 02:47:55.785]  All right, I'm going to go back to your calls right now ahead of Joel Gilbert hosting the next hour.
[02:47:55.825 --> 02:47:56.846]  I'm going to host part of that with him.
[02:47:56.866 --> 02:48:02.188]  I'm going to play part of the Sanders press conference on McCabe, too, so we'll have Gilbert take over about 15 after.
[02:48:02.348 --> 02:48:06.549]  I'm going to go to your calls, though, just briefly because they're reminding me to do this and I barely do it.
[02:48:07.590 --> 02:48:10.611]  If you don't buy products at InfoWarsTore.com, we don't continue on.
[02:48:10.651 --> 02:48:12.532]  We shut down because they've taken our sponsors.
[02:48:12.572 --> 02:48:13.392]  Everybody knows what they've done.
[02:48:13.772 --> 02:48:15.573]  But hey, the good news is you have been buying the products.
[02:48:15.593 --> 02:48:16.153]  They're great products.
[02:48:16.173 --> 02:48:16.793]  You've been liking them.
[02:48:16.813 --> 02:48:17.694]  You've been reordering them.
[02:48:18.823 --> 02:48:21.726]  If you're a listener that's been on the fence, infowarestore.com.
[02:48:23.268 --> 02:48:33.539]  That is how you get great products, and most importantly, stick your thumb in the eye of the globalists, and promote free speech, and defy their system of total control.
[02:48:34.636 --> 02:48:36.497]  We've got to end this special in a couple days.
[02:48:36.577 --> 02:48:42.978]  We've got $50 off on the Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system, four phase, the last phase ion filter.
[02:48:43.378 --> 02:48:44.719]  Leading competitors are $400 to $600.
[02:48:44.759 --> 02:48:48.020]  Just a few years ago, leading competitors were $800 to $1,000.
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:49.540]  The prices are going down.
[02:48:49.980 --> 02:48:50.920]  We used to sell it for like $250 to $300.
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:53.061]  Now they've got costs down, so it's normally $200.
[02:48:53.141 --> 02:48:53.261]  It's $149!
[02:48:53.301 --> 02:48:54.221]  We've got 479 reviews.
[02:49:01.254 --> 02:49:04.277]  We're talking about 4.9 stars.
[02:49:04.417 --> 02:49:05.378]  It's unbelievable.
[02:49:05.758 --> 02:49:08.180]  It's the very best unit out there that helps fund our operation.
[02:49:09.121 --> 02:49:13.765]  Like I said, I think they make it for like 80 bucks, so we like split between 80-something dollars and that.
[02:49:13.905 --> 02:49:15.967]  I think we make like 30, 40 bucks on it, that deal.
[02:49:16.307 --> 02:49:18.909]  We've got to sell a lot of these to fund this operation.
[02:49:18.929 --> 02:49:25.055]  But I believe in selling you the very best products at the very lowest prices, because that's how I want to be traded.
[02:49:25.235 --> 02:49:26.015]  And you've responded.
[02:49:26.716 --> 02:49:28.877]  We sell unbelievable amounts of stuff.
[02:49:28.957 --> 02:49:36.242]  It's like if you have a graph of like 90% you know is the cost and everything and a little 10% up here for us to fund things.
[02:49:36.422 --> 02:49:37.723]  We have to sell a crap ton.
[02:49:38.163 --> 02:49:42.285]  But a lot of times we got stuff even lower than Amazon and better systems.
[02:49:43.286 --> 02:49:46.788]  So again Bezos hates you, wants your guns, wants to talk with the president.
[02:49:48.658 --> 02:49:50.620]  Gets funded by taxpayers for free shipping.
[02:49:50.640 --> 02:49:52.702]  If you want taxpayer money for free shipping, go to Amazon.
[02:49:52.743 --> 02:49:53.603]  We can't do it all the time.
[02:49:53.623 --> 02:49:54.244]  We do it sometimes.
[02:49:54.264 --> 02:49:55.606]  It's not free shipping right now.
[02:49:55.966 --> 02:49:57.027]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:49:57.087 --> 02:49:58.269]  It's just up to you what you want to do.
[02:49:59.380 --> 02:50:05.301]  We have the InfoWars Mind Body Pack, that's the Vitamineral Fusion, Fruit Punch, Multivitamin, and Amino Acid.
[02:50:05.781 --> 02:50:08.322]  And then the Brain Force, that's 40% off together.
[02:50:08.822 --> 02:50:12.523]  We've got the new Pollen Block, that's so amazing, people are loving.
[02:50:12.823 --> 02:50:16.043]  And Body E, the Ultimate Turmeric Formula, those are both 50% off.
[02:50:16.283 --> 02:50:18.524]  Those specials have to end very soon because they are selling out.
[02:50:18.884 --> 02:50:21.584]  But you built InfoWars, so I'm not complaining.
[02:50:22.165 --> 02:50:24.045]  Every time we get attacked, people just come through.
[02:50:25.145 --> 02:50:27.186]  Let me tell you something, I'm not going to belabor this, but let me tell you.
[02:50:28.086 --> 02:50:28.886]  We're getting cold.
[02:50:30.114 --> 02:50:33.015]  By up to 10 TV stations a day.
[02:50:34.756 --> 02:50:36.897]  And we are getting the satellites they want.
[02:50:37.237 --> 02:50:39.198]  And I'm not gonna list the stations that are calling us.
[02:50:39.238 --> 02:50:44.060]  These are, some of them are the top three.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:52.944]  We've gotten two calls from TV broadcast stations that are in the top three in the country.
[02:50:53.884 --> 02:50:55.425]  And I remembered why I even said this.
[02:50:57.449 --> 02:51:10.119]  That the owner of one of these was putting my films on years ago, and I thought, I remember in a meeting like three years ago, I go, I bet stations like that'll pick us up, and now that the owner is calling up in one of the most popular cities in the country, West Coast.
[02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:15.563]  And, because people want to make a big splash now.
[02:51:15.603 --> 02:51:16.684]  They want to really change things.
[02:51:16.704 --> 02:51:17.764]  They get the fights on.
[02:51:18.425 --> 02:51:23.429]  And I don't even want to go on air and tell listeners this really positive stuff, because the enemy listens.
[02:51:23.889 --> 02:51:24.930]  You know, they know we don't lie.
[02:51:26.032 --> 02:51:27.193]  We make mistakes, we don't lie.
[02:51:27.233 --> 02:51:31.614]  Paul Watson goes, we defeated YouTube, we've defeated all this, we have the most impressions, we're winning.
[02:51:31.935 --> 02:51:35.056]  And they had like a hundred articles the next week going, they admit they're winning, ban them!
[02:51:35.616 --> 02:51:41.259]  And then they started restricting us, so... I'm not gonna fly under the radar anymore, though.
[02:51:41.819 --> 02:51:54.805]  And I'm not gonna sit here and not tell you that... It's a lot of money to spend a million and a half dollars on three satellites we need, and the closed captioning and all the rest of the stuff to go 24 hours a day, but we are going to reach
[02:51:58.494 --> 02:52:03.599]  It looks like hundreds and hundreds of UHF and VHF and hundreds of cable stations were already on.
[02:52:05.420 --> 02:52:07.582]  40 plus, if you count cable and TV, without even trying.
[02:52:08.022 --> 02:52:09.484]  This is so exciting right now.
[02:52:10.104 --> 02:52:11.385]  And nobody's ever done this.
[02:52:11.405 --> 02:52:13.667]  Because I just knew in my head, I don't want my own vanity channel.
[02:52:14.008 --> 02:52:14.888]  No one watches that.
[02:52:15.028 --> 02:52:23.336]  I want to beam direct about the TV and cable themselves and be on the lower peg, the lower channels that have all the viewers.
[02:52:24.189 --> 02:52:29.352]  You're not going to just have re-runs of Bonanza or re-runs of the Rifleman, which is fine.
[02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:33.615]  You're going to have Alex Jones 24 hours a day.
[02:52:33.875 --> 02:52:35.016]  Can you imagine?
[02:52:35.276 --> 02:52:36.196]  People have never gotten this.
[02:52:36.216 --> 02:52:36.757]  What's going to happen?
[02:52:36.797 --> 02:52:37.437]  It's already happening.
[02:52:37.737 --> 02:52:39.158]  The stations are getting the word.
[02:52:39.178 --> 02:52:40.119]  See, it's coming to the industry.
[02:52:40.299 --> 02:52:41.099]  They're getting ratings.
[02:52:41.139 --> 02:52:42.020]  They're getting sponsors.
[02:52:42.460 --> 02:52:43.401]  This is the other big secret.
[02:52:44.041 --> 02:52:46.803]  And Ted was cool on this because I have my own show on my show.
[02:52:47.623 --> 02:52:52.304]  But GCN, I said, listen, you can keep having half the ads on the radio, because I don't even really deal with those.
[02:52:52.344 --> 02:52:55.865]  But I said, I'm going to give our TV affiliates free to air.
[02:52:56.345 --> 02:53:01.246]  That means the 15 minutes of commercial space is all theirs, and I'll do a few minutes an hour plugging myself.
[02:53:01.767 --> 02:53:03.147]  I want the stations to have that.
[02:53:03.707 --> 02:53:04.427]  No one's done it.
[02:53:04.527 --> 02:53:08.088]  And the word went out, free to air, and it has just been amazing.
[02:53:08.888 --> 02:53:10.149]  So I almost left GCN a few months ago.
[02:53:10.169 --> 02:53:10.649]  I said, you know,
[02:53:11.638 --> 02:53:22.088]  I'll put you guys on the map, all your shows are great, whatever, Ted's a great guy, but I just said, my show, I'm doing it, all the rest of it, and I'm free to air.
[02:53:22.468 --> 02:53:25.051]  So, radio, it's still not free to air.
[02:53:25.391 --> 02:53:27.633]  That's one reason I think about leaving GCN.
[02:53:28.114 --> 02:53:36.622]  You know, I want to tell our radio stations, because imagine if I told our radio stations, you are free to air, you get all the ads, we get an additional 200 affiliates in like a month.
[02:53:37.262 --> 02:53:42.464]  And then maybe I say, oh then, you know, Ted, I'll give you a couple minutes of ads, you know, where I plug during the show, but I don't need to do that.
[02:53:42.704 --> 02:53:43.484]  And I love Ted.
[02:53:43.504 --> 02:53:44.224]  I love all those guys.
[02:53:44.504 --> 02:53:46.525]  I just communicate, you know, out in the open about all this stuff.
[02:53:46.865 --> 02:53:54.667]  This is the kind of stuff where my loyalty is so intense that I let it get in the way of progress because I'm not even being disloyal.
[02:53:55.348 --> 02:53:56.128]  And see, now I'm ranting.
[02:53:56.148 --> 02:53:56.888]  I haven't gone to your calls.
[02:53:58.289 --> 02:53:59.769]  That's the things we're involved in.
[02:53:59.869 --> 02:54:00.909]  That's the things we're doing.
[02:54:01.009 --> 02:54:02.510]  And I mean, 10 stations a day?
[02:54:03.891 --> 02:54:11.235]  And I mean, it's like New York, LA, Miami, they're like, we're ready, but we don't like the satellite you got.
[02:54:11.415 --> 02:54:15.897]  And it's like, it's amazing.
[02:54:16.737 --> 02:54:23.961]  I was talking to a gentleman in Japan and he said, yeah, you're, you're on Japanese TV, dude.
[02:54:25.560 --> 02:54:26.261]  What do you mean?
[02:54:26.301 --> 02:54:34.351]  They got local stations, and every day, my wife tunes in, and for 30 minutes, at least, here and there, they have clips of you on local community Japanese TV.
[02:54:34.652 --> 02:54:39.778]  The word went out, those congressional hearings, saying they want to shut us down, and the world went.
[02:54:40.811 --> 02:54:42.132]  Well, what's Alex Jones talking about?
[02:54:42.212 --> 02:54:51.557]  And I mean, from Japan, to Russia, to Nigeria, to South Africa, to Canada, to student channels.
[02:54:51.697 --> 02:54:56.900]  I mean, everybody is putting clips of our reporters and our guests, and it's whatever you want to take!
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:00.321]  Like Congressman Gates earlier, it's whatever you want.
[02:55:00.642 --> 02:55:02.002]  It's already all free to air.
[02:55:02.463 --> 02:55:05.464]  I can say on radio stations it's not, because of GCN, that's fine.
[02:55:05.724 --> 02:55:08.126]  I get it, they gotta fund themselves, but clips of my show!
[02:55:09.215 --> 02:55:15.097]  I get these calls constantly saying, I'm a radio station, I'd like to air clips of your show in my morning show.
[02:55:15.597 --> 02:55:16.718]  It's free to air!
[02:55:17.138 --> 02:55:17.498]  Do it!
[02:55:17.518 --> 02:55:23.360]  But they're all like, conservatives are so like this, they're like, well, can I put InfoWars on the side of my barn?
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:23.980]  You better!
[02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:26.601]  Or create your own website and do it!
[02:55:26.681 --> 02:55:27.961]  We're in a war!
[02:55:29.262 --> 02:55:30.642]  They're trying to shut down our speech.
[02:55:32.483 --> 02:55:34.884]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters, go to the sound of the guns.
[02:55:36.864 --> 02:55:37.725]  It's the very same thing.
[02:55:37.985 --> 02:55:38.305]  I'm like...
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:46.301]  Sitting there with these stations calling, going, can we just download your show and air it off PrisonPlanet.tv or whatever.
[02:55:46.321 --> 02:55:50.262]  And I'm like, yes, yes, yes, yes, but I don't even need to say yes.
[02:55:51.463 --> 02:55:53.303]  I get the stations and lawyers wanting it.
[02:55:53.323 --> 02:55:53.743]  Take it!
[02:55:54.203 --> 02:55:54.684]  Take it!
[02:55:55.104 --> 02:55:55.584]  Take it!
[02:55:55.984 --> 02:55:56.424]  Take it!
[02:55:56.784 --> 02:55:57.204]  Take it!
[02:55:57.224 --> 02:56:00.025]  I'm not going to sit here and have them shut it, because here's the deal.
[02:56:01.265 --> 02:56:03.726]  Stations know we had 86 million viewers election week.
[02:56:04.645 --> 02:56:07.047]  And don't believe me, Google and all them took notice of that.
[02:56:07.067 --> 02:56:08.268]  86 million.
[02:56:08.528 --> 02:56:12.331]  So they've suppressed us down to 35, 40 million a week, blocking us right now.
[02:56:13.131 --> 02:56:14.192]  If you can call that blocking.
[02:56:16.754 --> 02:56:22.158]  But it doesn't matter because it just went like cut one head off, five more grow.
[02:56:22.858 --> 02:56:23.259]  And so
[02:56:24.318 --> 02:56:25.079]  It's an exciting time.
[02:56:25.099 --> 02:56:25.819]  I'm going to shut up now.
[02:56:25.859 --> 02:56:26.360]  I promise.
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:27.000]  I'm going to Mark.
[02:56:27.461 --> 02:56:28.021]  I'm going to Chris.
[02:56:28.061 --> 02:56:28.522]  I'm going to Tim.
[02:56:28.542 --> 02:56:29.042]  I'm going to Sam.
[02:56:29.062 --> 02:56:34.407]  But I walked back there in the affiliate relations area and I was looking at these emails, these calls, and these people.
[02:56:34.427 --> 02:56:38.210]  And I remembered some of the station owners years ago were like, can you get on the satellite?
[02:56:38.230 --> 02:56:38.971]  It was the reason I did it.
[02:56:38.991 --> 02:56:39.831]  Well, they're now ready.
[02:56:40.412 --> 02:56:41.473]  But I'm just going to say this.
[02:56:42.734 --> 02:56:48.018]  When I blow the bugle that we're about to do a charge, the enemy is shooting at me big time.
[02:56:48.038 --> 02:56:48.739]  And I'm not bitching.
[02:56:48.839 --> 02:56:49.900]  If they get me, I'm all ready.
[02:56:49.920 --> 02:56:50.521]  I'm just saying.
[02:56:51.528 --> 02:57:03.212]  You cannot fund, and you cannot support, and you cannot pray, and I say this humbly because it's actually shameful that I'm one of the best things we've got in this operation, but it didn't matter.
[02:57:03.312 --> 02:57:04.112]  I was willing to do it.
[02:57:04.612 --> 02:57:07.233]  So we're here, and we are massively expanding.
[02:57:07.253 --> 02:57:11.254]  We've hired like 20 new people the last few months, and we're radically expanding.
[02:57:11.274 --> 02:57:14.735]  We got huge studios going in, contracts, everything, and I'm just 110% ready.
[02:57:16.596 --> 02:57:19.098]  Down the road, if I get in a bad situation, I'll sell my house.
[02:57:19.558 --> 02:57:21.880]  I've even talked to my daddy about our family land in East Texas.
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:28.504]  I said, Dad, if we get in deep crap, you need to sell off our ranch and that oil and gas, which I never used to fund this, it's not my money.
[02:57:28.864 --> 02:57:30.025]  He said, I'm absolutely behind you.
[02:57:30.325 --> 02:57:34.208]  So I want George Soros and everybody else to know, you're not the only pieces of crap with money.
[02:57:34.588 --> 02:57:37.470]  I don't got what you got, but every dollar I got is like a million of yours.
[02:57:37.750 --> 02:57:40.312]  So you want to fight, you Nazi collaborators, son of a bitch?
[02:57:40.612 --> 02:57:41.372]  You've got one!
[02:57:41.493 --> 02:57:41.953]  You got it?
[02:57:45.769 --> 02:57:47.209]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.

[02:58:45.701 --> 02:58:47.664]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:58:47.784 --> 02:58:48.085]  Go ahead.
[02:58:48.487 --> 02:58:50.588]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[02:58:50.608 --> 02:58:53.630]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:58:54.450 --> 02:58:55.571]  It just gets old, man.
[02:58:55.891 --> 02:58:57.612]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:58:58.312 --> 02:59:00.393]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:59:00.633 --> 02:59:04.615]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:59:04.635 --> 02:59:07.156]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:59:07.957 --> 02:59:10.298]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:59:10.638 --> 02:59:11.739]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[02:59:11.999 --> 02:59:12.879]  Us being shut down?
[02:59:13.119 --> 02:59:14.140]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:59:14.580 --> 02:59:15.620]  You know what, Alex?
[02:59:15.660 --> 02:59:16.741]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[02:59:16.761 --> 02:59:17.561]  Hey, Frank!
[02:59:17.861 --> 02:59:23.222]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:59:23.522 --> 02:59:27.803]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:59:28.023 --> 02:59:30.904]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:59:31.164 --> 02:59:31.544]  You understand?
[02:59:31.624 --> 02:59:32.904]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:59:33.285 --> 02:59:34.405]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:59:35.385 --> 02:59:40.771]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[02:59:41.011 --> 02:59:41.711]  Do you understand?
[02:59:41.732 --> 02:59:42.973]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:59:43.373 --> 02:59:44.855]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:59:44.875 --> 02:59:53.403]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:00.939 --> 03:00:06.805]  A listener pointed out the great video that Dan Lyman shot of Trump arriving in Davos should have added Flight of the Valkyries to it.
[03:00:12.600 --> 03:00:21.427]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:21.867 --> 03:00:25.770]  You know, a lot of people want to hold back on their name, their money, their energy in this fight.
[03:00:25.790 --> 03:00:27.632]  Think if they sit on the sidelines, they're going to win.
[03:00:28.292 --> 03:00:32.095]  That may have worked while this country got taken over and run into the ground, but we're down to the wire now.
[03:00:32.515 --> 03:00:39.421]  You're going to lose everything you've got culturally, financially, spiritually, if you're not all in on this fight right now.
[03:00:40.999 --> 03:00:42.260]  I think a lot of people get that.
[03:00:42.300 --> 03:00:43.801]  I think we see that and that's why we're winning.
[03:00:45.003 --> 03:00:48.946]  But the enemy is now getting off the bench, they're getting off the couch, they're getting off the porch.
[03:00:49.466 --> 03:00:50.187]  The fight's on.
[03:00:50.948 --> 03:00:53.370]  So let's not think about who's winning, let's think about who's fighting.
[03:00:54.250 --> 03:00:57.653]  A lot of people get in a fight with you and they punch you in the head and they wait to see what it does.
[03:00:58.254 --> 03:01:00.336]  By then you've punched them four or five times, they're on the ground.
[03:01:01.431 --> 03:01:02.433]  Thank you Alex, great to speak with you.
[03:01:18.482 --> 03:01:19.022]  Thank you, sir.
[03:01:19.683 --> 03:01:26.186]  Alex, I do have a short comment about what they may have left in their arsenal to use against the people of the world.
[03:01:26.226 --> 03:01:28.006]  I think that's the most important comment out there.
[03:01:28.407 --> 03:01:31.208]  You know they're not giving up because they're slaves to evil.
[03:01:31.468 --> 03:01:33.289]  They will keep attacking until they're six feet under.
[03:01:34.215 --> 03:01:40.560]  Well, they've got everything to lose and nothing to gain at this point outside of being able to take the momentum back.
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:54.790]  And the momentum is, since the election of Donald Trump and even before in his campaign, it was a genesis of the momentum he's provided, similar to the momentum that you provided through the last 20 years or so.
[03:01:55.850 --> 03:02:03.816]  When I look at this world and the people in this world, I know that God made only two gentlemen.
[03:02:04.781 --> 03:02:05.021]  Thank you.
[03:02:26.013 --> 03:02:31.117]  And you've actually, just as two individual human beings, but two very special human beings.
[03:02:31.538 --> 03:02:33.239]  I don't mean to stop you, but let me tell you something.
[03:02:33.259 --> 03:02:34.000]  It's you, Mark.
[03:02:34.720 --> 03:02:35.701]  You are awake.
[03:02:35.761 --> 03:02:36.702]  You got ridiculed.
[03:02:36.762 --> 03:02:37.442]  You got attacked.
[03:02:37.482 --> 03:02:38.443]  It's all of us together.
[03:02:39.424 --> 03:02:47.130]  Well, I do understand that, Alex, but God made you and Donald Trump for a purpose, and that purpose has been achieved at this point.
[03:02:47.210 --> 03:02:49.052]  It will continue to be achieved, I believe.
[03:02:49.531 --> 03:02:52.737]  I don't think they have anything left in their arsenal.
[03:02:53.739 --> 03:02:55.502]  Well, not bragging, but I'll tell you this.
[03:02:56.043 --> 03:02:58.046]  The military and Congress, they listen every day.
[03:02:58.533 --> 03:02:59.474]  Not for talking points.
[03:02:59.554 --> 03:03:02.435]  This is the only place they hear what they already know.
[03:03:02.775 --> 03:03:06.578]  Then they see mainstream media, this is key, attack them and it makes them question.
[03:03:06.838 --> 03:03:08.519]  They already know what I know ten times more.
[03:03:08.839 --> 03:03:11.000]  They're already doing more important things than we're doing.
[03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:16.603]  The point is, they're there being attacked before there wasn't somebody to say, no, you're doing the right thing.
[03:03:16.944 --> 03:03:19.985]  We're giving aid and comfort to the American Revolution.
[03:03:20.306 --> 03:03:20.786]  You understand?
[03:03:20.906 --> 03:03:23.407]  We're there to stop the demoralization.
[03:03:23.427 --> 03:03:24.088]  Does that make sense?
[03:03:25.024 --> 03:03:28.005]  Well, it's fulfilling God's will.
[03:03:28.105 --> 03:03:36.368]  It's actually turning people back to God when you look at the medium-long run of it into the future, because we become more good the good we already have.
[03:03:36.408 --> 03:03:38.229]  Notice Trump set the pro-life marches.
[03:03:38.509 --> 03:03:42.350]  He's making about families and humans, valuing humans, valuing families.
[03:03:42.630 --> 03:03:44.791]  That's how you kill it in people's own hearts.
[03:03:45.271 --> 03:03:45.792]  Exactly.
[03:03:46.692 --> 03:03:49.113]  And they know Trump has had a religious
[03:03:49.853 --> 03:03:57.726]  He was always a Christian, but, you know, it wasn't until about 10 years ago, I'm talking to people that know Trump, that he had a big religious experience and became a really hardcore Christian.
[03:03:58.067 --> 03:04:00.771]  And I don't mean to give out secrets and stuff here, but that's what's going on.
[03:04:01.012 --> 03:04:02.073]  That's why they're so upset.
[03:04:02.133 --> 03:04:04.137]  Trump is a born-again Christian.
[03:04:04.727 --> 03:04:06.588]  Well, and it's the same with you, Alex.
[03:04:06.608 --> 03:04:08.428]  Like I say, you're two peas in a pod.
[03:04:08.829 --> 03:04:12.110]  You're highly unusual because of the talents you've been given by God.
[03:04:12.490 --> 03:04:25.255]  To actually have the energy, the faith, the love for God, to actually turn around the tide of evil, what you've been coming in, in the last 20 years, especially since 9-11, in a way where it doesn't seem to be so malleable.
[03:04:25.275 --> 03:04:27.035]  But you, it's not you, it's all of us.
[03:04:27.456 --> 03:04:31.057]  Like you said, it was the big tide, it was gonna crush everything.
[03:04:31.437 --> 03:04:32.798]  You were down to the very wire.
[03:04:33.218 --> 03:04:35.579]  This is our last chance, as I think what you're saying.
[03:04:35.859 --> 03:04:36.819]  But thank you for the support.
[03:04:37.139 --> 03:04:37.840]  Let me tell you something.
[03:04:38.220 --> 03:04:41.421]  I run into people out there on the street that are more articulate and smarter than I am.
[03:04:41.841 --> 03:04:43.782]  They just are so humble, they never got in the fight.
[03:04:44.362 --> 03:04:47.524]  I'm just somebody that got in the fight, and so we're here.
[03:04:47.564 --> 03:04:48.344]  But God bless you.
[03:04:48.744 --> 03:04:49.445]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:49.485 --> 03:04:50.125]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:50.185 --> 03:04:53.866]  More calls from Forrest, Marcus, Sam, Wild, Chris, and Tim.
[03:04:53.906 --> 03:04:54.407]  Straight ahead.
[03:04:54.607 --> 03:04:55.107]  One minute break.
[03:04:56.624 --> 03:05:01.888]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[03:05:02.608 --> 03:05:05.910]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:05:06.771 --> 03:05:12.815]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:05:14.796 --> 03:05:21.140]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[03:05:21.960 --> 03:05:27.183]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:05:27.804 --> 03:05:36.529]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including
[03:05:37.249 --> 03:05:39.991]  Eurycoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[03:05:40.631 --> 03:05:46.135]  Macaru from Peru, horny goatweed from China, and tribulus from India.
[03:05:46.915 --> 03:05:50.417]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[03:05:50.877 --> 03:05:56.141]  Get Alpha Power now at 50% off and secure your bottle today.
[03:05:56.161 --> 03:06:00.563]  He's going the distance.
[03:06:00.623 --> 03:06:01.564]  He's going for speed.
[03:06:17.668 --> 03:06:22.573]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:25.576 --> 03:06:33.344]  Alright, we're going right back to your phone calls right now.
[03:06:37.312 --> 03:06:40.194]  Man, I tell you, you see the economy turning around and everything.
[03:06:40.254 --> 03:06:41.855]  I mean, just every indicator turning around.
[03:06:41.875 --> 03:06:43.637]  That's how you know it's artificial.
[03:06:44.117 --> 03:06:55.405]  God, they took a desolate country like China with 600 million souls, turned them into slaves, and built the biggest economy in the world, but the people got nothing.
[03:06:57.298 --> 03:07:07.885]  The middle class is non-existent there, and Trump comes in and just starts taking the balls and chains off our legs so we can run this marathon, and suddenly we're out in front again.
[03:07:07.905 --> 03:07:13.409]  And I just see the demoralization of Hollywood, the attack on the family, everything.
[03:07:13.489 --> 03:07:15.110]  It's so sick.
[03:07:15.510 --> 03:07:17.011]  Does that mean our families are perfect?
[03:07:17.071 --> 03:07:17.271]  No.
[03:07:17.651 --> 03:07:18.812]  Does that mean men are perfect?
[03:07:18.852 --> 03:07:19.072]  No.
[03:07:19.573 --> 03:07:20.653]  Does that mean women are perfect?
[03:07:20.713 --> 03:07:20.914]  No.
[03:07:20.974 --> 03:07:22.074]  But we're humans.
[03:07:22.114 --> 03:07:22.735]  We're together.
[03:07:23.035 --> 03:07:25.577]  We've got a huge adventure in the past.
[03:07:26.385 --> 03:07:28.966]  And the President, and that's what it's all about!
[03:07:30.366 --> 03:07:36.507]  And then they tell us all, we're all guilty, we're all bad, we're all this, we're all that, when they're the scum!
[03:07:38.668 --> 03:07:40.168]  Well, it's time for them to start paying.
[03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:43.649]  And you know what these people don't like?
[03:07:43.689 --> 03:07:44.749]  It's not being in power.
[03:07:46.029 --> 03:07:47.830]  They lust after it, they enjoy it, they...
[03:07:50.046 --> 03:07:56.109]  They love it, and that's our weakness, is the average person that's strong, an alpha female, an alpha male, just good people.
[03:07:56.129 --> 03:08:01.871]  They're not just good alphas, good, good, good, you know, whatever.
[03:08:01.911 --> 03:08:05.813]  There's also people that are just workers, people that are loving, people that are good.
[03:08:06.792 --> 03:08:07.813]  Some of the strongest souls.
[03:08:07.833 --> 03:08:09.855]  The Bible says the meek won't hurt the earth.
[03:08:10.275 --> 03:08:21.165]  They just want to be happy and be nice and they get bullied into submission to a system believing they're conforming, believing they're doing the right thing because they're being led by false alphas.
[03:08:22.099 --> 03:08:26.823]  Because real alphas have laid down and let the scum take the field.
[03:08:26.843 --> 03:08:31.247]  Because there were so many resources in the modern world because of technology.
[03:08:31.267 --> 03:08:33.089]  Eh, whatever.
[03:08:33.189 --> 03:08:34.630]  Okay, let those groups do things.
[03:08:34.690 --> 03:08:35.611]  I've got my own life.
[03:08:35.991 --> 03:08:37.192]  I've got power over them.
[03:08:37.252 --> 03:08:38.273]  I'm gonna ignore them.
[03:08:40.235 --> 03:08:42.377]  But while you ignored them, they took control of your children.
[03:08:42.917 --> 03:08:44.138]  They took control of your life.
[03:08:44.579 --> 03:08:46.160]  They crave the power.
[03:08:47.261 --> 03:08:48.222]  You must stand against them.
[03:08:50.967 --> 03:08:53.208]  All right, let me take all your calls for the next House comes on.
[03:08:53.248 --> 03:08:55.609]  Joel Gilbert's got a lot to cover, but Tim in Seattle.
[03:08:55.629 --> 03:08:56.309]  Tim, thanks for holding.
[03:08:56.329 --> 03:08:57.389]  Then Forrest in Houston.
[03:08:57.769 --> 03:08:58.610]  Go ahead, Tim.
[03:08:59.590 --> 03:08:59.990]  Hey, Alex.
[03:09:00.010 --> 03:09:00.430]  How's it going?
[03:09:00.550 --> 03:09:01.211]  Thanks for holding.
[03:09:01.291 --> 03:09:02.391]  I just was curious.
[03:09:02.411 --> 03:09:04.572]  You were saying that they, what would they do next?
[03:09:05.392 --> 03:09:06.532]  They're going to do whatever.
[03:09:07.613 --> 03:09:16.336]  Las Vegas and everything else, the false flag potentiality is extremely high right now, and I don't see them not doing anything.
[03:09:16.356 --> 03:09:19.297]  So I think there will be a false flag.
[03:09:20.899 --> 03:09:21.680]  No, I agree with you.
[03:09:21.980 --> 03:09:27.926]  I mean, they've had their globalist spokesperson saying, you release this memo, there'll be a massacre.
[03:09:28.247 --> 03:09:30.509]  And when there is a massacre, they go, oh, you're such a genius.
[03:09:30.809 --> 03:09:32.411]  They don't ask, who told you to say that?
[03:09:32.671 --> 03:09:33.492]  No, I totally agree.
[03:09:33.512 --> 03:09:36.475]  So let me ask you, what are they going to pull, false flag-wise?
[03:09:36.795 --> 03:09:37.656]  A bio-attack?
[03:09:38.737 --> 03:09:39.138]  Hard to say.
[03:09:39.198 --> 03:09:42.881]  Also, you know, I think McCabe is covering up all that Las Vegas information.
[03:09:44.082 --> 03:09:47.484]  I'm glad that he's gone, and also I think that the real reason... Ooh, that is astute!
[03:09:47.504 --> 03:10:11.715]  Because the FBI low-level, not low-level, but the guys that do the killing, the fighting, the hostage rescue team, it's like the Department of Defense is really the Department of War, I mean, you know, the hostage rescue team told us, and I'm not belittling them, it's just these names are ridiculous, the guys that went in told us the truth, which has been proven, and you're right, McCabe then covered it up from Trump, but Trump already knew and smashed Saudi Arabia two weeks later.
[03:10:11.735 --> 03:10:12.015]  Go ahead.
[03:10:16.104 --> 03:10:16.404]  He's gone?
[03:10:17.405 --> 03:10:18.165]  That's a good point, he made.
[03:10:19.305 --> 03:10:20.846]  Yeah, we're living in epic times.
[03:10:21.026 --> 03:10:25.808]  And that's just, people go, hey, we're grilling steaks, come over and watch the UT game.
[03:10:25.848 --> 03:10:30.590]  And I'm just like, man, I mean, I'm like in the game for the future of the country.
[03:10:31.863 --> 03:10:36.666]  I'm not knocking your football game, but people act like, oh, you're being weak, Alex.
[03:10:36.866 --> 03:10:38.667]  You know, enjoy yourself.
[03:10:38.747 --> 03:10:39.567]  Have some fun.
[03:10:40.087 --> 03:10:41.388]  I do have fun doing this.
[03:10:41.928 --> 03:10:48.192]  I don't want to go watch a bunch of spoiled, rotten college football players get worshipped running into each other and stuff.
[03:10:48.232 --> 03:10:48.672]  I get it.
[03:10:49.172 --> 03:10:49.973]  I played football.
[03:10:50.033 --> 03:10:50.593]  I watched it.
[03:10:50.653 --> 03:10:51.433]  I like football.
[03:10:51.853 --> 03:10:53.374]  My grandfather played football at UT.
[03:10:53.454 --> 03:10:54.215]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:10:55.435 --> 03:10:57.597]  You know, it doesn't matter to me.
[03:10:58.277 --> 03:11:00.999]  The big epic battle for the future of humanity matters.
[03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:02.841]  They're diverting us with this.
[03:11:03.762 --> 03:11:04.262]  Forrest!
[03:11:05.083 --> 03:11:05.663]  In Houston.
[03:11:05.983 --> 03:11:06.924]  You're on the air, Forrest.
[03:11:08.465 --> 03:11:09.486]  How are you doing today, brother?
[03:11:10.247 --> 03:11:13.870]  Man, I tell you, I'm happier than a pig in a bunch of... I didn't hear anything.
[03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:14.991]  I ain't got no volume on my end.
[03:11:15.191 --> 03:11:15.811]  Well, I'm sorry.
[03:11:15.851 --> 03:11:16.492]  Forrest, you hear me now?
[03:11:18.953 --> 03:11:20.574]  Might have some audio problems in there.
[03:11:20.895 --> 03:11:22.076]  I ain't got no volume on my end.
[03:11:22.336 --> 03:11:22.977]  Okay, Forrest.
[03:11:23.257 --> 03:11:24.298]  Sorry about that not working.
[03:11:24.318 --> 03:11:25.499]  We'll put you on hold and see what's happening.
[03:11:25.999 --> 03:11:27.220]  Marcus in Fort Worth.
[03:11:27.260 --> 03:11:28.141]  Marcus in Fort Worth.
[03:11:28.161 --> 03:11:28.582]  You're on the air.
[03:11:28.602 --> 03:11:28.922]  Go ahead.
[03:11:31.144 --> 03:11:33.506]  Alex, I got two things to say.
[03:11:35.728 --> 03:11:43.335]  The first thing is, Mueller and John Kerry both have the exact same look.
[03:11:44.790 --> 03:11:55.600]  Yeah, they both look like Frankenstein, and you're alluding to Skull and Bones, where they have gay sex, and I'm not saying they're bad people for that, and they roll around and men crap on them and piss on them, and then they get in a coffin and Lucifer enters their body.
[03:12:08.191 --> 03:12:09.352]  I mean, that's what they admit.
[03:12:10.113 --> 03:12:11.314]  They believe Lucifer does it.
[03:12:11.695 --> 03:12:16.800]  From anthropologists, like pygmies in Africa, you know, when they're killing an elephant, do they really believe they're eating the soul of the elephant?
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:17.241]  I don't know.
[03:12:17.641 --> 03:12:23.147]  But that's what the Democratic leader and Republican leadership are.
[03:12:23.167 --> 03:12:23.467]  You're right.
[03:12:23.507 --> 03:12:24.709]  They both look like Frankenstein.
[03:12:25.785 --> 03:12:29.666]  Yeah, so yeah, I just wanted to point that out because it's a spiritual battle more than just a physical one.
[03:12:30.147 --> 03:12:32.867]  Um, two, I've called, I've called my congressman.
[03:12:33.007 --> 03:12:40.530]  I've called a few, not my congressman because, you know, I don't really necessarily even know the district I live in, but I just got prompted to because I was watching InfoWars and like, you need to call your congressman.
[03:12:40.550 --> 03:12:41.831]  I was like, well, how hard can that be?
[03:12:42.231 --> 03:12:47.412]  Google the number, call your congressman, tell him, release, release the entire memo.
[03:12:47.673 --> 03:12:48.633]  It's not that hard to do.
[03:12:49.997 --> 03:12:55.498]  Well, they got the vote coming out at 4 Central in about an hour and 50 minutes and we're going to be covering it live.
[03:12:55.518 --> 03:13:02.179]  We're going to be covering the State of the Union tomorrow and Nancy Pelosi's comedy response, I mean, she is hilarious.
[03:13:03.379 --> 03:13:05.780]  And people go, oh, that's racist, you're making fun of a black lady.
[03:13:06.360 --> 03:13:08.040]  Pelosi's even more ridiculous.
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:09.880]  She's even more mentally braindead.
[03:13:11.661 --> 03:13:11.901]  Pardon me?
[03:13:11.921 --> 03:13:16.441]  I'm black, so, I'm black, so it's like, does my opinion not count whenever I say that?
[03:13:16.541 --> 03:13:19.262]  Whenever I say that, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:13:19.958 --> 03:13:21.741]  Yay Trump, yay this, yay that.
[03:13:24.626 --> 03:13:25.247]  Yeah, no, sure.
[03:13:25.267 --> 03:13:27.030]  They were just popping by here thinking I made a mistake.
[03:13:27.987 --> 03:13:34.450]  I'm saying, give the Maxine Waters comedy hour coming up tomorrow that we're going to cover after the President's speech.
[03:13:34.470 --> 03:13:35.910]  We're going to cover her response live.
[03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:43.214]  Then I said I'm not being racist about Maxine Waters because I think Pelosi's even more brain dead, even more pathetic.
[03:13:43.594 --> 03:13:46.415]  Thank you, Marcos, but thank you, Crewe, for helping me get that straight.
[03:13:46.995 --> 03:13:50.997]  Because I do, both of them are so addled and senile and brain dead and corrupt.
[03:13:51.037 --> 03:13:52.718]  I don't know which one is the same.
[03:13:52.738 --> 03:13:55.399]  They're both Congresswomen from California.
[03:13:56.159 --> 03:13:57.000]  Which is my whole point.
[03:13:57.741 --> 03:13:59.642]  Forrest in Houston, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:14:02.265 --> 03:14:03.426]  Hey boss, how you doing today?
[03:14:03.806 --> 03:14:04.867]  I'm good brother, go ahead.
[03:14:06.048 --> 03:14:20.881]  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you know, with the whole memo stuff that's coming out and that huge web from the Epoch Times or whatever, you know, how do we stop these major corporations working with state and foreign nations to cover up like political parties or working with foreign national governments
[03:14:21.201 --> 03:14:23.642]  I mean, that's the biggest form of treason I've ever heard in my life.
[03:14:38.809 --> 03:14:39.389]  Amen, brother.
[03:14:39.809 --> 03:14:40.990]  I mean, I don't want an MVP.
[03:14:41.050 --> 03:14:42.731]  I want an HVT.
[03:14:42.831 --> 03:14:44.511]  I want the high-valued players.
[03:14:44.851 --> 03:14:48.813]  I want the people on the international stage, these world bankers, these people.
[03:14:48.853 --> 03:14:50.694]  And I'm not saying crash the whole economy.
[03:14:50.754 --> 03:14:56.616]  I understand that they've monopolized so much field that it's going to take at least 20 to 30 years to fully give us free market.
[03:14:56.756 --> 03:14:58.076]  Hold on, I'm going to come back to you after the break.
[03:14:58.116 --> 03:14:59.277]  Forrest, you're two on target.
[03:14:59.297 --> 03:14:59.637]  Stay there.
[03:15:00.377 --> 03:15:00.717]  Stay there.
[03:15:00.797 --> 03:15:01.598]  He's absolutely right.
[03:15:02.358 --> 03:15:04.919]  We'll come back to Forrest and I'll hand the baton over to Joel Gilbert.
[03:15:06.604 --> 03:15:10.285]  Ron Paul used to say, if I win the presidency, I'm not a dictator, it'll take decades to fix this.
[03:15:10.766 --> 03:15:25.892]  Trump is using their own bubble system, that there were bubbles for them only, to create a bubble for us, to see the free market work, so he can set up some factories, get some stuff going, and then, probably even start a war to get the country out of this, which, I mean, it is what it is.
[03:15:27.398 --> 03:15:28.959]  If you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[03:15:28.999 --> 03:15:30.200]  That's all I'm telling the shy comms.
[03:15:30.721 --> 03:15:32.062]  That's what we're gearing up for right now.
[03:15:32.543 --> 03:15:35.245]  That's the big build-up, because that was the sell-out plan.
[03:15:35.285 --> 03:15:39.008]  And I got stacks of articles here about the Communist Chinese in our business.
[03:15:39.449 --> 03:15:52.040]  So we'll come back to Forrest in Houston, then Sam, then Wild, then Chris, then Joe Gilbert hosting the rest of the fourth hour, then the War Room and the live coverage of congressional vote on releasing the memo.
[03:15:52.080 --> 03:15:53.261]  Stay with us and spread the links.
[03:15:55.689 --> 03:16:05.131]  As the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers know, we are always researching and bringing you the very cutting edge of high quality products.
[03:16:05.711 --> 03:16:10.372]  And that's especially true when it comes to nutraceuticals and supplements.
[03:16:11.032 --> 03:16:22.375]  We know that our modern environment is bombarding our guts with all sorts of toxins and heavy metals and pesticides, herbicides that basically kill the good flora.
[03:16:23.260 --> 03:16:36.646]  We have been working for several years with top researchers in the United States to bring you three new top-of-the-line affordable probiotics that are true game changers.
[03:16:37.466 --> 03:16:42.609]  Now the first is a digestive enzyme that I'm extremely excited about.
[03:16:43.089 --> 03:16:44.530]  All of us know that if you eat a lot of meat,
[03:16:45.390 --> 03:16:46.231]  And a lot of protein.
[03:16:46.732 --> 03:16:48.114]  You don't chew it properly sometimes.
[03:16:48.154 --> 03:16:48.775]  There's buildup.
[03:16:48.915 --> 03:16:52.481]  You can even rot inside your guts, causing diverticulitis.
[03:16:52.661 --> 03:16:53.182]  You name it.
[03:16:53.743 --> 03:16:56.106]  You don't get the good micronutrients that are in it as well.
[03:16:57.199 --> 03:17:04.664]  Well, Carnivore from Infowars Life, ladies and gentlemen, is the next level of digestive enzyme.
[03:17:05.205 --> 03:17:17.173]  And when you take it, combined with the new Floralife, that I'm going to break down here in a moment, and also the everyday Floralife maintenance, they synergistically work together.
[03:17:17.493 --> 03:17:20.015]  The globalists are bombarding our gut.
[03:17:20.655 --> 03:17:24.638]  They know it's the key to taking control of civilization and society.
[03:17:25.039 --> 03:17:26.900]  It is the true Trojan Horse.
[03:17:27.340 --> 03:17:41.192]  And whether it's our new digestive enzyme, Cardivorb, or whether it's the new Floralife Advanced Restoration, or the Floralife Everyday Maintenance, it is critical for you and your family to have healthy guts.
[03:17:41.412 --> 03:17:45.195]  And it is undoubted that there are serious benefits
[03:17:45.555 --> 03:17:47.635]  from proven high-quality probiotics.
[03:17:47.996 --> 03:17:52.797]  There are some similar formulas out there that are at least three times the cost of this.
[03:17:53.137 --> 03:17:56.017]  And people think because they're paying more, it must be the best.
[03:17:56.457 --> 03:17:58.238]  That's not my philosophy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:17:58.738 --> 03:18:09.040]  I'm bringing you something that is the very best from our deep research, working with top developers, scientists, and experts in the field at the lowest price.
[03:18:10.160 --> 03:18:12.361]  But whether you take one, two, or all three,
[03:18:13.493 --> 03:18:26.280]  I have never experienced the type of energy and the type of digestive ease and the changes that I went through in the last few months going on this formula before we brought it to you.
[03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:36.065]  We believe from working with top experts in the United States that we have developed the very best probiotic and digestive enzyme for breaking down protein and meat that there is.
[03:18:37.614 --> 03:18:39.336]  This is the total win-win.
[03:18:39.856 --> 03:18:45.561]  It uses the modern techniques as well, so it doesn't have all the additives and garbage.
[03:18:46.122 --> 03:18:50.526]  Simply put, our new Floralife line is the very best out there.
[03:18:50.846 --> 03:18:56.371]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[03:18:56.872 --> 03:18:59.955]  Many probiotics out there don't even have
[03:19:00.515 --> 03:19:00.755]  Yeah.
[03:19:18.536 --> 03:19:22.077]  Two years of research, what we are bringing to the market.
[03:19:22.437 --> 03:19:28.118]  And your purchase doesn't just give you better digestive health and all the different micronutrients and things you need.
[03:19:28.578 --> 03:19:33.260]  It also funds an organization dedicated to promoting liberty worldwide.
[03:19:33.860 --> 03:19:42.882]  Whether it's Floralife, Advanced Restoration, Carnivore, Digestive Enzyme, or the everyday maintenance that's great for the go.
[03:19:43.996 --> 03:19:47.700]  It's all available at infowarestore.com today.
[03:19:47.900 --> 03:19:55.729]  When you purchase it, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalists and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[03:19:59.333 --> 03:20:01.976]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.345 --> 03:20:20.670]  When we were students in school, there were certain teachers that would torture the students any way they could.
[03:20:26.735 --> 03:20:32.940]  But when they were home at night, their fat and psychopathic lives would thrash them within inches of their lives.
[03:20:35.763 --> 03:20:37.204]  They were cowards looking for power.
[03:20:39.372 --> 03:20:44.155]  Kit Daniel's article, the prolific writer, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, such an important article.
[03:20:44.716 --> 03:20:45.676]  Please get it out to everybody.
[03:20:45.696 --> 03:20:48.758]  I can tell you, you get this article out, it'll change destinies.
[03:20:49.599 --> 03:20:53.482]  Trump should, hashtag, release the memo during State of the Union.
[03:20:53.942 --> 03:20:59.086]  Memo would bolster Trump's accomplishments in face of deep state sabotage.
[03:20:59.846 --> 03:21:04.189]  We had Congressman Gates on earlier, Matt Gates, breaking it down.
[03:21:04.209 --> 03:21:07.731]  We're going to hear some excerpts of that in the first hour of the War Room.
[03:21:08.789 --> 03:21:10.171]  Coming up with Owen Schroyer.
[03:21:11.112 --> 03:21:13.355]  They're going to cover the vote to release the memo.
[03:21:13.695 --> 03:21:15.297]  Then it goes to the president.
[03:21:15.738 --> 03:21:18.602]  He may instantly authorize it right when it passes.
[03:21:18.642 --> 03:21:19.263]  We don't know.
[03:21:19.843 --> 03:21:21.345]  This is the excitement of what's happening.
[03:21:21.385 --> 03:21:25.190]  But as I told you last week, the vote will be Monday, according to congressional sources.
[03:21:26.135 --> 03:21:27.576]  We just had a congressman on about it.
[03:21:28.197 --> 03:21:29.878]  Media said, Jones is fake news!
[03:21:29.898 --> 03:21:31.199]  He didn't talk to any congresspeople.
[03:21:31.860 --> 03:21:32.761]  Yeah, sure I didn't.
[03:21:33.962 --> 03:21:37.204]  I mean, all we try to do is tell the truth.
[03:21:37.264 --> 03:21:46.392]  Stuff changes sometimes and we're wrong, but like, whatever's going on now, we bust our little booties to tell you the truth, because we want that!
[03:21:47.453 --> 03:21:48.113]  We want that!
[03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:51.771]  We're dumbasses, according to the Globalist.
[03:21:52.111 --> 03:21:52.991]  We're chivalrous.
[03:21:53.011 --> 03:21:54.092]  They think we're mentally ill.
[03:21:54.432 --> 03:21:58.554]  They think Trump's mentally ill for caring about America and not selling out our industry.
[03:21:59.574 --> 03:22:02.915]  But notice, one year in office, it's all turning around because it was artificial.
[03:22:03.216 --> 03:22:07.977]  We didn't have half the world's wealth 40 years ago and lose it overnight without a mistake.
[03:22:08.258 --> 03:22:09.758]  They sold us out!
[03:22:11.519 --> 03:22:12.799]  Forrest, you're making great points.
[03:22:12.859 --> 03:22:13.880]  I'm not going to interrupt this time.
[03:22:14.200 --> 03:22:14.720]  Recap.
[03:22:14.740 --> 03:22:15.240]  Start over.
[03:22:15.280 --> 03:22:16.301]  Tell people what you were saying.
[03:22:17.737 --> 03:22:19.898]  I was just saying, you know, I don't want to go after MVPs.
[03:22:19.958 --> 03:22:26.321]  I really want to go after HVTs, these international monetary manipulating bankers that use slave labor to oppress our people.
[03:22:26.761 --> 03:22:28.222]  And I also want to thank you, Alex Jones.
[03:22:28.522 --> 03:22:35.485]  Thank you for awaking people from this sociopath, this fake sociopath, and really changing betas into alpha males.
[03:22:35.805 --> 03:22:43.468]  Because this is a psychological war more than it's a spiritual war because once we win these mines, we can go after these bankers and there is no bunker.
[03:22:43.508 --> 03:22:49.811]  I'm telling you, if they thought the Rothschilds crashing their helicopter or allegedly they thought that was bad, just wait.
[03:22:49.991 --> 03:22:52.132]  If they don't get arrested and have God
[03:22:55.653 --> 03:22:57.033]  I am afraid for their health.
[03:22:57.433 --> 03:23:11.237]  I'm afraid for all of them around because our forefathers did not die in some foxhole in Korea and Vietnam to have these oligarchs piss all over our ancestors because our IPs track them.
[03:23:11.357 --> 03:23:12.277]  We know where they go.
[03:23:13.305 --> 03:23:13.465]  Wow.
[03:23:30.506 --> 03:23:31.266]  Well, no, I agree with you.
[03:23:31.286 --> 03:23:32.667]  That's why I actually get guilty.
[03:23:32.727 --> 03:23:37.029]  Like, I hope they push it too far at an animal level, because they're going to get torn to pieces.
[03:23:37.369 --> 03:23:38.369]  I don't think they realize.
[03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:40.830]  They just thought that, here's the thing, we were asleep.
[03:23:41.131 --> 03:23:42.311]  They thought we were intimidated.
[03:23:42.811 --> 03:23:43.872]  Now we're waking up.
[03:23:45.032 --> 03:23:51.895]  They still think we're, they don't understand that we just want to fix things nicely because we don't want to have to peacock around.
[03:23:52.195 --> 03:23:56.157]  But they are one millimeter now from total destruction.
[03:23:58.001 --> 03:23:59.082]  We got them bagged and tagged.
[03:23:59.122 --> 03:24:00.143]  I mean, it's like this.
[03:24:00.243 --> 03:24:04.466]  I already got laminated photos on every single, you know, given to all the police station.
[03:24:04.506 --> 03:24:16.335]  I mean, every 4chan post that was released of all the HVTs from the, you know, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, the European Commission, where they have these offshore mega banks and using their little Soros puppets.
[03:24:16.735 --> 03:24:20.898]  They better be very careful because their bank accounts are cryptic.
[03:24:21.358 --> 03:24:22.439]  They will hit zero.
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:26.544]  And they need to understand that their power is a manipulation.
[03:24:26.584 --> 03:24:28.525]  I mean, it's psychosis at this point.
[03:24:28.786 --> 03:24:35.512]  And they better be quiet and take their pills and take their little child's sacrifices and calm it down.
[03:24:36.233 --> 03:24:40.077]  They were offered abstention and to be left alone.
[03:24:40.477 --> 03:24:41.278]  They didn't go away.
[03:24:41.759 --> 03:24:42.840]  They brought the war.
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:44.141]  They reaped the win.
[03:24:44.181 --> 03:24:44.762]  They're about to
[03:24:45.965 --> 03:24:47.606]  Absolutely experienced the real deal.
[03:24:47.646 --> 03:24:48.366]  I appreciate your call.
[03:24:48.406 --> 03:24:49.186]  God bless you, Forrest.
[03:24:49.226 --> 03:24:50.626]  Great points out of Houston.
[03:24:50.646 --> 03:24:52.687]  Yeah, it's an epic time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:53.767 --> 03:24:59.649]  And I just pray to God they back off.
[03:24:59.689 --> 03:25:00.409]  But Hillary doesn't.
[03:25:01.070 --> 03:25:04.731]  I mean, she looks like a dying corpse and she's on the Grammys.
[03:25:04.771 --> 03:25:05.171]  They just
[03:25:06.112 --> 03:25:17.676]  And all these weird little wimps that can hardly talk, dancing around like it's some high school play, worshipping this demon, this lawyer for child molesters is her specialty?
[03:25:18.397 --> 03:25:20.958]  She's a frickin' Renfield for child molesters!
[03:25:22.018 --> 03:25:23.018]  She's a supplier!
[03:25:24.959 --> 03:25:26.620]  And we can't get this off our back?
[03:25:30.161 --> 03:25:31.221]  Sam, and then Wild.
[03:25:31.642 --> 03:25:34.763]  Sam in Oklahoma, you're on the air about the Democrat counterattack.
[03:25:35.083 --> 03:25:35.403]  Go ahead.
[03:25:39.617 --> 03:25:40.738]  Alright, Sam is gone.
[03:25:41.358 --> 03:25:43.139]  Let's go to Wylde in Wisconsin.
[03:25:43.179 --> 03:25:44.760]  Wylde in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[03:25:44.780 --> 03:25:55.086]  Hi Mr. Jones, I was just wondering if you think there's any pizza related items in the FISA memo and if you're hearing the children screaming.
[03:25:56.567 --> 03:26:02.110]  You know, I don't think this FISA memo and all this deals with child trafficking, but that's record level in the media.
[03:26:02.470 --> 03:26:04.611]  The Islamists are doing it, so that's certainly part of it.
[03:26:05.272 --> 03:26:07.593]  But no, I don't think there's anything like that in this new memo.
[03:26:10.214 --> 03:26:13.581]  Okay, do you feel the child's pedophilia going on?
[03:26:15.299 --> 03:26:17.080]  Well, I mean, yeah, Wild, I appreciate your call.
[03:26:17.100 --> 03:26:19.081]  Of course there's people abusing children.
[03:26:19.562 --> 03:26:22.604]  Of course that's the spirit of this system, is abusing the innocent.
[03:26:23.004 --> 03:26:26.306]  So that's their kind of thing, their underground currency.
[03:26:26.886 --> 03:26:29.868]  Used to be art, used to be gold, used to be weapons.
[03:26:29.928 --> 03:26:31.489]  Now the big currency is children.
[03:26:31.889 --> 03:26:33.470]  We covered that yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[03:26:33.991 --> 03:26:38.393]  Our last caller, I'm going to turn this over to Joel Gilbert, who's waiting in the wings with huge breaking news.
[03:26:38.773 --> 03:26:40.935]  Chris in Chicago, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:26:40.955 --> 03:26:43.216]  Hello, Alex.
[03:26:43.797 --> 03:26:44.157]  Thank you, Chris.
[03:26:45.478 --> 03:26:46.118]  Hey, great.
[03:26:46.659 --> 03:26:53.782]  You know, the main thing with these idiot elites and the reason they're losing is because they ruin everything.
[03:26:54.002 --> 03:26:55.123]  It used to be fun to watch the NFL.
[03:26:55.183 --> 03:26:57.324]  It used to be fun to watch the Grammys.
[03:26:57.364 --> 03:26:59.165]  You know, a little bit, on a little bit of a level.
[03:26:59.205 --> 03:27:00.265]  But now, you know what I do?
[03:27:00.325 --> 03:27:01.886]  I spend time with my kids on Sundays.
[03:27:01.946 --> 03:27:02.886]  I don't get drunk anymore.
[03:27:02.906 --> 03:27:03.727]  It's fantastic.
[03:27:04.187 --> 03:27:11.090]  So, you know, they did play their hand a little too soon because by pissing everybody off, they woke them up.
[03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:12.551]  Also, real quick, I was
[03:27:13.297 --> 03:27:23.362]  Listening to Dr. Corsi last night and about all the stuff on 8chan and how releasing, I mean, is that kind of like the ace in the hole?
[03:27:23.742 --> 03:27:35.728]  You know, I've been told by five different Pentagon sources, high level, that that whole 8chan thing is real and that they're basically forecasting what they'd like to see happen and giving you information.
[03:27:35.748 --> 03:27:38.610]  But so that's definitely real and that's why Corsi's been
[03:27:39.690 --> 03:27:40.991]  I'll let you know, because the enemy knows.
[03:27:41.591 --> 03:27:45.333]  The White House directly asked Corsi to be on the H-hand beat a month ago.
[03:27:45.914 --> 03:27:49.676]  So, that's directly from the White House.
[03:27:50.917 --> 03:27:52.138]  Dr. Corsi is so smart.
[03:27:52.198 --> 03:27:56.620]  And then, one other thing... But I mean, what does that say about QAnon?
[03:27:57.721 --> 03:28:01.103]  Whether it's... I mean, we're being told by the White House, please cover this.
[03:28:01.163 --> 03:28:02.484]  So, what does that tell you?
[03:28:03.283 --> 03:28:12.186]  It does, and you know, real quick, whatever happened to Fritz Springmeier, because I'm sure he would have a lot of insight into all this pedophilia and all this crap, you know what I'm saying?
[03:28:12.847 --> 03:28:14.287]  We should get Fritz Springmeier back on.
[03:28:14.347 --> 03:28:16.328]  There's all these great guests we forget about getting on.
[03:28:16.608 --> 03:28:17.608]  We'll work to get that done.
[03:28:17.648 --> 03:28:18.809]  Okay, I'm going to break.
[03:28:19.789 --> 03:28:24.011]  Joel Gilbert does 30 minutes, and then the War Room with the great
[03:28:25.103 --> 03:28:29.826]  Crew, Owen Schroyer, we've got Roger Stone coming up and so much more.
[03:28:30.146 --> 03:28:41.792]  And about an hour into that, we're going to have the House vote on releasing the Intelligence Committee intelligence on what happened with the whole situation with the memo gate.
[03:28:43.113 --> 03:28:43.914]  The FISA memo.
[03:28:44.394 --> 03:28:46.515]  So spread the word, that is coming up straight ahead.
[03:28:47.015 --> 03:28:49.257]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:28:50.537 --> 03:28:51.378]  Please spread that link.
[03:28:55.848 --> 03:28:57.589]  Joel Gilbert joins us for the balance of the hour.
[03:28:57.709 --> 03:29:02.251]  Here is the trailer for the powerful new film available at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:29:03.031 --> 03:29:04.732]  Trump, the art of the insult.
[03:29:04.752 --> 03:29:07.193]  Directed by the amazing director, Joel Gilbert.
[03:29:07.233 --> 03:29:08.093]  Here is the trailer.
[03:29:08.533 --> 03:29:12.715]  Call women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs.
[03:29:13.676 --> 03:29:15.036]  Only Rosie O'Donnell.
[03:29:15.256 --> 03:29:18.458]  And they said that wasn't politically correct.
[03:29:18.518 --> 03:29:19.038]  Who cares?
[03:29:22.659 --> 03:29:23.700]  You haven't been called.
[03:29:25.582 --> 03:29:26.623]  Go back to Univision.
[03:29:27.824 --> 03:29:29.305]  I think Jeff is a nice person.
[03:29:29.425 --> 03:29:30.286]  He's very low energy.
[03:29:30.366 --> 03:29:35.010]  I'm not used to that kind of a person.
[03:29:35.050 --> 03:29:35.571]  Throw him out.
[03:29:35.831 --> 03:29:36.932]  Throw him out into the cold.
[03:29:37.272 --> 03:29:39.494]  Don't give him their coat.
[03:29:40.435 --> 03:29:42.497]  No coats.
[03:29:42.817 --> 03:29:44.219]  L-Y-I-N apostrophe.
[03:29:44.279 --> 03:29:45.640]  Lying dead.
[03:29:49.855 --> 03:29:53.277]  I have never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion.
[03:29:53.317 --> 03:29:57.040]  The most dishonest human beings.
[03:29:57.080 --> 03:29:57.760]  These people right here.
[03:29:57.780 --> 03:29:59.061]  Look at all the cameras.
[03:29:59.341 --> 03:30:01.483]  So disgusting.
[03:30:03.624 --> 03:30:05.905]  This socialist slash communist.
[03:30:06.326 --> 03:30:07.206]  Crazy Bernie.
[03:30:07.246 --> 03:30:08.787]  He's crazy as it may look.
[03:30:08.847 --> 03:30:12.009]  Pocahontas?
[03:30:12.029 --> 03:30:12.910]  The Indian?
[03:30:13.090 --> 03:30:14.031]  Very offensive.
[03:30:14.071 --> 03:30:14.891]  I'm sorry about that.
[03:30:15.231 --> 03:30:16.072]  A Pocahontas?
[03:30:18.417 --> 03:30:19.078]  Crooked Hillary!
[03:30:19.118 --> 03:30:20.319]  Crooked Hillary, folks!
[03:30:20.339 --> 03:30:22.420]  She's been crooked from the beginning!
[03:30:27.764 --> 03:30:28.384]  Crooked Hillary!
[03:30:28.424 --> 03:30:31.827]  Politicians are really dishonest.
[03:30:31.947 --> 03:30:35.329]  Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK.
[03:30:35.369 --> 03:30:38.752]  This had nothing to do with me, except I might have pointed it out.
[03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:43.016]  This guy was sweating so badly.
[03:30:43.176 --> 03:30:44.998]  Thank God he has really large ears.
[03:30:45.018 --> 03:30:46.379]  The biggest ears I've ever seen.
[03:30:47.059 --> 03:30:48.621]  Because they were protecting him.
[03:30:48.741 --> 03:30:49.621]  I'm trying to be nice.
[03:30:49.661 --> 03:30:51.163]  You know, I'm working hard to be nice.
[03:30:52.484 --> 03:30:54.065]  He was begging for my endorsement.
[03:30:54.305 --> 03:30:56.087]  I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees.
[03:30:56.147 --> 03:30:57.288]  He would have dropped to his knees.
[03:30:59.065 --> 03:31:01.487]  He put glasses on so people will think he's smart.
[03:31:01.927 --> 03:31:02.507]  It just doesn't work.
[03:31:02.527 --> 03:31:04.529]  You know, people can see through the glasses.
[03:31:05.609 --> 03:31:07.470]  I'll make three or four major speeches.
[03:31:07.490 --> 03:31:10.332]  If he makes a speech for 15 minutes, he goes home, goes to bed.
[03:31:11.453 --> 03:31:13.274]  We live off Chinese manufacturing.
[03:31:13.554 --> 03:31:16.836]  That's because when you say we, you are stupid.
[03:31:17.137 --> 03:31:18.077]  Repeat after me.
[03:31:18.097 --> 03:31:20.899]  Donald, you're not going to be able to insult your way to the presidency.
[03:31:20.959 --> 03:31:22.340]  That's not going to happen.
[03:31:22.860 --> 03:31:23.661]  So help me God.
[03:31:24.001 --> 03:31:25.322]  Congratulations, Mr. President.
[03:31:31.417 --> 03:31:34.439]  We will make America great again!
[03:31:35.680 --> 03:31:36.540]  Go home to mommy.
[03:31:36.560 --> 03:31:38.302]  They're gonna tuck you in bed.
[03:31:38.562 --> 03:31:40.123]  And your mother is voting for Trump!
[03:31:41.482 --> 03:31:42.722]  You've made a lot of amazing films.
[03:31:42.742 --> 03:31:43.523]  We've carried them all.
[03:31:43.783 --> 03:31:44.423]  We sell them all.
[03:31:44.443 --> 03:31:45.183]  They're all groundbreaking.
[03:31:45.203 --> 03:31:46.983]  But this one, this one is fun.
[03:31:47.644 --> 03:31:48.904]  And very, very celebratory.
[03:31:48.944 --> 03:31:51.464]  So, congratulations on what you've done.
[03:31:51.484 --> 03:31:52.345]  It's really a special film.
[03:31:53.425 --> 03:31:53.905]  Thanks a lot.
[03:31:53.925 --> 03:31:58.726]  Look, I urge everyone, you've got to get this film in the Infowars.com store.
[03:31:59.526 --> 03:32:02.207]  First of all, you'll laugh non-stop the whole time.
[03:32:02.847 --> 03:32:05.548]  But more importantly, there's a lot of important lessons.
[03:32:06.108 --> 03:32:18.632]  You'll see how Middle America fell in love with a Manhattan billionaire because he was the only one of the Republicans that was willing and capable of standing up to Hillary and the leftist media complex.
[03:32:18.932 --> 03:32:22.093]  And he did it, don't forget, with a mix of truth and humor.
[03:32:22.133 --> 03:32:23.113]  That's why it stuck.
[03:32:23.333 --> 03:32:28.335]  So this film, 95 minutes of non-stop laughter, but you get to know Donald Trump.
[03:32:28.495 --> 03:32:29.435]  I thought I knew Trump.
[03:32:29.515 --> 03:32:30.336]  I studied Trump.
[03:32:30.796 --> 03:32:31.496]  I thought I knew him.
[03:32:32.036 --> 03:32:34.837]  Only when you see this all back to back, how he reacts.
[03:32:35.417 --> 03:32:36.578]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.536 --> 03:33:27.437]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:29.037 --> 03:33:33.778]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:44.120 --> 03:33:45.541]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:45.621 --> 03:33:46.421]  I'm Joel Gilbert.
[03:33:47.142 --> 03:33:51.683]  Frequent guest on the Alex Jones Show, coming to you right from the left coast here in Los Angeles.
[03:33:52.063 --> 03:34:01.985]  You know me as a frequent guest, filmmaker of Dreams to My Real Father, There's No Place Like Utopia, and the brand new film for sale right now in the Alex Jones Infowars store.
[03:34:02.505 --> 03:34:07.226]  You gotta get There's No Place... I'm sorry, this is the art of the insult.
[03:34:07.946 --> 03:34:09.206]  Get it in the Alex Jones store.
[03:34:09.886 --> 03:34:12.807]  Now, coming up next segment, writer Jack Cashill, he wrote
[03:34:13.965 --> 03:34:18.789]  Deconstructing Obama, Ron Brown's body, and also silence TWA 800.
[03:34:19.129 --> 03:34:30.299]  We're going to talk about the Steele dossier that we wrote about last week, where we discovered that it was written likely by a Russian and absolutely not by Christopher Steele.
[03:34:30.959 --> 03:34:34.922]  Now, the Democrats love to talk about interference in our elections.
[03:34:35.763 --> 03:34:37.725]  Elections are the basis of democracy.
[03:34:38.325 --> 03:34:40.087]  I'm going to argue to you right now that
[03:34:41.087 --> 03:34:44.408]  Barack Obama interfered in the last three elections.
[03:34:44.948 --> 03:34:51.171]  Let's start by pulling up the photo of Barack Obama with Louis Farrakhan, Nation of Islam leader.
[03:34:51.711 --> 03:34:54.092]  Louis Farrakhan with Barack Obama.
[03:34:54.132 --> 03:34:57.093]  This photo was hidden from the public intentionally.
[03:34:57.953 --> 03:35:04.396]  Now, we also have photos, of course, with Barack Obama with terrorist emeritus Bill Ayers sitting on a board together.
[03:35:05.136 --> 03:35:10.178]  We've got him with Venezuela's dictator, the communist Cesar Chavez.
[03:35:10.982 --> 03:35:17.705]  And you'll notice that Barry is very comfortable with anti-American extremists, and they're very comfortable with him.
[03:35:17.725 --> 03:35:22.928]  And as we found out, it's because they share values together.
[03:35:23.628 --> 03:35:27.610]  Now, in 2008, I'll tell you how Barack Obama interfered.
[03:35:28.611 --> 03:35:34.314]  Democracy is supposed to allow voters to choose between candidates based on their agenda and who they are.
[03:35:35.257 --> 03:35:40.060]  Obama intentionally denied a fair process because he burst on the scene in 2007.
[03:35:41.341 --> 03:35:42.441]  No one knew who he was.
[03:35:43.182 --> 03:35:52.527]  He introduced himself as a middle-of-the-road, mainstream politician, when in reality he was part of the little-known world of American Marxism.
[03:35:52.947 --> 03:35:56.769]  Let's start by looking at a video of Barack Obama talking about his father.
[03:35:56.989 --> 03:35:59.731]  Barack Obama telling us who his father is.
[03:36:01.636 --> 03:36:06.459]  My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya.
[03:36:07.039 --> 03:36:08.100]  He grew up herding goats.
[03:36:09.061 --> 03:36:11.182]  My father grew up herding goats in Kenya.
[03:36:11.682 --> 03:36:14.444]  My father was from Kenya, from Africa.
[03:36:16.460 --> 03:36:20.443]  Okay, so because of his background, Obama told us he would bring us together.
[03:36:20.864 --> 03:36:21.804]  It was a big lie.
[03:36:22.325 --> 03:36:37.536]  As I showed in my 2012 film, Dreams from My Real Father, Obama's real biological father, who was his ideological mentor, was in fact Soviet espionage agent and Communist Party USA propagandist, Frank Marshall Davis.
[03:36:38.177 --> 03:36:40.559]  Davis had a 600-page FBI file
[03:36:41.218 --> 03:36:54.123]  Because the FBI knew that he was ordered to Hawaii by the Kremlin in 1948 to organize the labor unions to strike against the state with the goal of expelling U.S.
[03:36:54.163 --> 03:36:55.463]  naval forces from Hawaii.
[03:36:55.503 --> 03:36:57.504]  The Russians thought that the U.S.
[03:36:57.544 --> 03:37:00.645]  naval forces were an obstacle to Soviet expansion in Asia.
[03:37:01.206 --> 03:37:08.228]  So in terms of who he was, Barack Obama was a red diaper baby, the child of a Communist Party USA member.
[03:37:08.589 --> 03:37:09.629]  He hid his background.
[03:37:10.316 --> 03:37:16.443]  And that would have made him unelectable, just like the photo of Obama with Louis Farrakhan.
[03:37:17.284 --> 03:37:19.006]  Now, what about Obama's agenda?
[03:37:19.406 --> 03:37:20.768]  What were people voting for?
[03:37:21.248 --> 03:37:23.571]  What did he promise people if you voted for him?
[03:37:24.131 --> 03:37:27.155]  Well, let's watch this video about Obama's promises.
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:36.344]  You can elect a president who has taught the Constitution and believes in the Constitution and will obey the Constitution.
[03:37:36.404 --> 03:37:39.666]  Marriage is the union between a man and a woman.
[03:37:40.006 --> 03:37:42.948]  Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit by half.
[03:37:43.409 --> 03:37:45.870]  No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.
[03:37:45.950 --> 03:37:47.011]  No more secrecy.
[03:37:47.171 --> 03:37:48.952]  That's a commitment I make to you as president.
[03:37:50.669 --> 03:37:53.432]  So Obama said he was a constitutional law professor.
[03:37:53.492 --> 03:37:55.034]  He's going to obey the Constitution.
[03:37:55.394 --> 03:37:56.655]  Cut the deficit in half.
[03:37:57.076 --> 03:37:59.078]  Marriage between man and a woman and God.
[03:37:59.578 --> 03:38:00.459]  He's a Christian.
[03:38:00.479 --> 03:38:01.701]  He'll support Israel.
[03:38:02.141 --> 03:38:03.723]  He'll be very transparent.
[03:38:04.183 --> 03:38:05.405]  A man above politics.
[03:38:06.125 --> 03:38:07.206]  It was all a lie.
[03:38:07.226 --> 03:38:10.409]  Obama had no intention of doing any of those things.
[03:38:10.890 --> 03:38:16.995]  This was a complete fraud, and this was how American socialism evolved.
[03:38:17.455 --> 03:38:25.923]  In the late 60s, American communism and socialism, SDS, Weather Underground, they bombed police stations, bombed the Capitol.
[03:38:26.283 --> 03:38:28.065]  They were calling for open revolution.
[03:38:28.445 --> 03:38:29.606]  Destroy the country.
[03:38:29.687 --> 03:38:32.249]  Replace the Constitution with the Communist Manifesto.
[03:38:33.223 --> 03:38:40.549]  This plan was so evil, it actually included putting 25 million Americans in re-education camps.
[03:38:41.449 --> 03:38:45.132]  This was so frightening and scary that it failed.
[03:38:45.172 --> 03:38:45.973]  It failed terribly.
[03:38:46.873 --> 03:38:52.598]  Let's take a listen to Larry Grathwald, who was an informant in the Weather Underground, telling what their plans were.
[03:38:53.917 --> 03:38:57.479]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[03:38:58.340 --> 03:39:02.282]  The reply was establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[03:39:02.642 --> 03:39:08.225]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate, that are die-hard capitalists?
[03:39:08.926 --> 03:39:11.207]  The reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[03:39:11.987 --> 03:39:19.612]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia.
[03:39:20.652 --> 03:39:25.956]  And hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[03:39:26.476 --> 03:39:30.259]  And they were dead serious.
[03:39:30.299 --> 03:39:45.030]  These same radicals from the 60s who were calling for open revolution, they came out of prison and went back to Chicago in the early 80s, and they taught the new generation of young radicals like Barack Obama that overthrowing the government from the outside is impossible.
[03:39:45.638 --> 03:39:47.199]  They said to them, here's the lesson.
[03:39:47.499 --> 03:39:49.079]  Keep your Marxism to yourself.
[03:39:49.620 --> 03:39:51.420]  Don't tell people about your socialism.
[03:39:51.640 --> 03:39:57.423]  Just say you want to help people, you want to give them free medical care, and you want to help families.
[03:39:57.903 --> 03:40:00.924]  Talk about change, but don't say what the change is.
[03:40:01.464 --> 03:40:07.466]  And this was how American socialism changed from open calls for revolution to the self-socialism of today.
[03:40:07.907 --> 03:40:12.968]  And this is how they turned the Democrat Party into a radical socialist party 25 years later.
[03:40:14.529 --> 03:40:15.910]  Using this strategy.
[03:40:15.930 --> 03:40:18.412]  They now call themselves, of course, progressives.
[03:40:19.814 --> 03:40:21.415]  That was 2008 through 2012.
[03:40:21.775 --> 03:40:26.899]  Of course, Obama interfered again in 2012, using the IRS.
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:31.263]  Despite the media whitewash, by 2010, most people got it.
[03:40:31.763 --> 03:40:33.585]  Obama was the radical in chief.
[03:40:33.745 --> 03:40:36.007]  The agenda he promised was a complete lie.
[03:40:36.607 --> 03:40:39.470]  And the Tea Party movement took over, helped take over the House.
[03:40:40.331 --> 03:40:43.814]  And Obama was poised to be swept out of office in 2012.
[03:40:44.755 --> 03:40:54.542]  But, of course, the IRS was used to suppress the organizing ability of the Tea Party conservatives, while the left was allowed to organize.
[03:40:55.623 --> 03:41:00.146]  Obama trampled on the will of the voters and on the democratic process with the IRS.
[03:41:00.907 --> 03:41:03.269]  There was no need for Russian interference, of course, in 2012.
[03:41:04.130 --> 03:41:07.132]  We had our own Bolshevik-in-Chief in the White House.
[03:41:08.257 --> 03:41:16.439]  Again, 2016, we're learning every day that Obama used the FBI and DOJ to spy on the Trump campaign.
[03:41:17.359 --> 03:41:23.421]  Now, this information was used to try to manipulate the electorate, and there's the Bolshevik in chief himself.
[03:41:25.021 --> 03:41:27.342]  In the next segment, I'm going to talk to Jack Cashill.
[03:41:28.242 --> 03:41:34.644]  We looked at the dossier, the Steele dossier, just a week ago, and like many people, we hadn't read it.
[03:41:35.319 --> 03:41:41.963]  As soon as I read it, I called up Jack and I said, listen, this thing looks like it was written by a non-native English speaker.
[03:41:43.224 --> 03:41:47.226]  And what's amazing is the FBI didn't notice that.
[03:41:47.506 --> 03:41:48.807]  No one in the media noticed that.
[03:41:48.887 --> 03:41:54.750]  There's terrible punctuation errors, misusage of verbs, misspellings.
[03:41:55.231 --> 03:41:57.232]  The sentence structure is a total disaster.
[03:41:58.201 --> 03:42:07.407]  We actually showed this to a former KGB officer, Konstantin Prebajinsky, intelligence official, and he said to us the following.
[03:42:08.048 --> 03:42:12.771]  He said, this is not an intelligence document of any kind.
[03:42:12.851 --> 03:42:13.892]  There are no references.
[03:42:14.332 --> 03:42:16.053]  There is no information whatsoever.
[03:42:16.233 --> 03:42:17.975]  It's pure foolish speculation.
[03:42:18.535 --> 03:42:20.917]  He said, I was laughing when I was reading it.
[03:42:21.557 --> 03:42:24.359]  So this is how ridiculous this document is, yet
[03:42:25.106 --> 03:42:35.709]  People in the intelligence community, the FBI, the FISA courts could not tell that it was a completely ridiculous document and intentionally used it to interfere in the 2016 election.
[03:42:36.149 --> 03:42:44.351]  So I have Barack Obama interfering in the last three elections and in the next segment, Jack Cashio and I are going to get into some more details.
[03:42:45.011 --> 03:42:48.371]  Don't forget again, Art of the Insult in the Infowars store.
[03:42:48.652 --> 03:42:50.272]  We'll be right back with Jack Cashio.
[03:42:55.208 --> 03:42:57.149]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:58.270]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:59.451]  Why is this so good?
[03:42:59.731 --> 03:43:04.974]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:43:05.054 --> 03:43:18.602]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:43:18.662 --> 03:43:20.043]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:43:20.943 --> 03:43:22.384]  Spreading disease around.
[03:43:22.464 --> 03:43:24.967]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:43:25.047 --> 03:43:26.328]  These are all parasites.
[03:43:26.368 --> 03:43:27.469]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:43:27.489 --> 03:43:28.529]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:43:28.830 --> 03:43:33.153]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:43:33.353 --> 03:43:36.536]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:43:36.596 --> 03:43:39.679]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:43:39.719 --> 03:43:40.720]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:43:40.780 --> 03:43:42.662]  Living Defense, Infowarslife.com.
[03:43:42.702 --> 03:43:43.743]  And folks, you can't lose.
[03:43:43.763 --> 03:43:45.824]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:43:46.465 --> 03:43:49.488]  And you support the broadcast, Infowarslife.com.
[03:43:49.748 --> 03:43:51.650]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[03:43:52.010 --> 03:43:53.972]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:43:55.854 --> 03:43:56.595]  I'm so excited.
[03:43:56.655 --> 03:44:06.221]  The new product at Infowarslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings, filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:44:06.821 --> 03:44:15.107]  This is a heart and brain pill, a nootropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:44:15.327 --> 03:44:24.073]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200.
[03:44:26.194 --> 03:44:30.978]  For the formulae, and I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists and developers.
[03:44:31.499 --> 03:44:34.261]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:44:34.401 --> 03:44:45.290]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglanone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:44:45.790 --> 03:44:47.092]  It is amazing!
[03:44:48.493 --> 03:44:53.457]  Red Pill, now available at InfoWarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[03:44:55.257 --> 03:45:05.305]  It's critical to support independent media operations that aren't these internet ghettos like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, like Infowars.com, and to spread the articles and the videos.
[03:45:05.846 --> 03:45:10.489]  And it's more critical than ever, too, to wear t-shirts out in public.
[03:45:10.810 --> 03:45:20.237]  Depending on how extreme you want to get, wear an Infowars.com shirt, you're going to be loved, you're going to get dinner bought for you, you're going to meet maybe your future spouse 90% of the time.
[03:45:20.257 --> 03:45:24.301]  10% of the time you may get hot coffee thrown on you and somebody trying to physically attack you.
[03:45:25.200 --> 03:45:34.945]  Or wear something like Don't Tread On Me that is a symbol that other patriots recognize so you can wear your colors publicly and meet like-minded people.
[03:45:35.385 --> 03:45:36.705]  That's what flags are about.
[03:45:36.765 --> 03:45:38.306]  That's what symbols are about.
[03:45:38.826 --> 03:45:51.072]  Now I had an idea because growing up I loved Book of the Month Club and Comic Book of the Month Club or Model of the Month Club where a model would come, you know, of a B-17 or a truck or whatever and I'd glue it together and paint it and everything.
[03:45:51.672 --> 03:45:54.194]  We have a shirt of the month that will be a
[03:45:55.234 --> 03:45:59.798]  Collectors Edition high-quality shirt that is only available for that month.
[03:45:59.998 --> 03:46:02.039]  But these shirts just came in a few days ago.
[03:46:02.520 --> 03:46:09.465]  It's a red version of our best-selling yellow version, Won't Tread on Me, with the American flag and Infowars.com.
[03:46:09.885 --> 03:46:16.250]  This red version will only be available for the next 25 days or so, because we just got them in a few days ago, and then that's it.
[03:46:16.650 --> 03:46:17.011]  And you get
[03:46:17.951 --> 03:46:22.593]  25% off when you order it at Infowarstore.com in the shirt of the month.
[03:46:22.973 --> 03:46:26.674]  You sign up in that and the auto-ship function can cancel anytime.
[03:46:27.134 --> 03:46:27.814]  It's totally free.
[03:46:28.234 --> 03:46:30.955]  And then you get the next shirt every month.
[03:46:31.556 --> 03:46:32.556]  You can give it as a gift.
[03:46:32.576 --> 03:46:33.636]  You can change the size.
[03:46:34.617 --> 03:46:38.798]  And you'll have a wardrobe of Patriot apparel for every occasion.
[03:46:39.338 --> 03:46:43.622]  It's available right now on InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:43.782 --> 03:46:46.285]  So again, thank you all for checking out InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:46.665 --> 03:46:47.846]  You built InfoWars!
[03:46:48.447 --> 03:46:50.509]  And we're going to the next level thanks to you!
[03:46:59.197 --> 03:47:01.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.732 --> 03:47:32.954]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:47:33.334 --> 03:47:36.355]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:38.256 --> 03:47:39.897]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.997 --> 03:47:42.358]  I am your host for this hour, Joel Gilbert.
[03:47:43.158 --> 03:47:46.199]  My guest is the journalist who's written many books.
[03:47:46.800 --> 03:47:51.042]  Jack Cashill, Deconstructing Obama, Ron Brown's Body, Silence, TW 800.
[03:47:53.351 --> 03:47:59.274]  We wrote an article last week called, Did Christopher Steele Write His Dossier or Did a Russian Associate?
[03:48:00.534 --> 03:48:02.155]  Let me welcome right now Jack Cashill.
[03:48:02.175 --> 03:48:02.655]  How are you?
[03:48:08.397 --> 03:48:17.681]  You know, I feel like I did when I read it the way I felt when I read Dreams from My Father in 2008, four years after the book had come out and the reissue.
[03:48:18.541 --> 03:48:20.082]  And when I read that book,
[03:48:21.054 --> 03:48:28.781]  For the first time, I'm reading through it and I'm thinking, I wonder who Obama's ghostwriter is, because I knew Obama's style well enough to know that he didn't write it himself.
[03:48:29.642 --> 03:48:39.110]  And I just started Googling around, and when I put in Google, when I put in, rather, Obama ghostwriter, all I got was, unlike John McCain, Obama doesn't need a ghostwriter.
[03:48:39.370 --> 03:48:40.931]  Barack Obama's a literary genius.
[03:48:40.951 --> 03:48:42.052]  He doesn't need a ghostwriter.
[03:48:42.453 --> 03:48:45.135]  Well, it was transparent to me, and I've written 12 books on my own.
[03:48:45.535 --> 03:48:46.756]  I've ghostwritten about another 15.
[03:48:48.095 --> 03:48:55.579]  That, no, this man did have a ghostwriter and that led me, in a couple months time, to Bill Ayers and the rest of that is sort of history.
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:48:59.041]  And with the dossier, same thing!
[03:48:59.141 --> 03:48:59.521]  Gosh!
[03:48:59.861 --> 03:49:00.162]  You know?
[03:49:03.103 --> 03:49:09.707]  So Jack, when I called you and asked you to take a look at the dossier, what was your first impression when you read through it?
[03:49:10.447 --> 03:49:13.369]  My first impression was to confirm what your suspicion was.
[03:49:13.982 --> 03:49:24.689]  This was not written by a fellow who was the head of the Debate Society at Cambridge University and a reporter for the Varsity, which was a school newspaper at Cambridge University.
[03:49:24.969 --> 03:49:27.151]  These guys are very gifted in the use of the language.
[03:49:27.631 --> 03:49:42.141]  The fellow who wrote this dossier, that's not to say that Steele didn't have some editing role in it, but the primary author of this dossier was almost assuredly not an English, a native English speaker, and he was almost most likely
[03:49:42.944 --> 03:49:58.380]  Someone from like Central Europe, where the or the, you know, the Russian language where they don't use articles, you know, typically, and so that the absence of a us and does, you know, the sort of random placement of commas.
[03:49:59.218 --> 03:50:06.001]  The phrasing, these awkward phrasing, especially on subjects of sex, like, Golden Shower's Urination Show?
[03:50:06.242 --> 03:50:07.102]  Who says that?
[03:50:07.362 --> 03:50:07.702]  You know?
[03:50:08.463 --> 03:50:10.204]  And it was constant throughout the document.
[03:50:10.764 --> 03:50:19.208]  And it's clear that a Cambridge-educated native English speaker did not write this document.
[03:50:20.709 --> 03:50:22.290]  What about Steele's background?
[03:50:22.310 --> 03:50:26.352]  I think we included something about his involvement in far-left groups.
[03:50:27.395 --> 03:50:29.258]  Yeah, I don't know about that either, and I should have.
[03:50:30.239 --> 03:50:41.335]  He belonged to the anti-nuke movement at Cambridge, roughly at the same time that Barack Obama belonged to the anti-nuke movement at Columbia University.
[03:50:41.736 --> 03:50:42.797]  If you recall, in the early 1980s,
[03:50:44.179 --> 03:50:47.141]  This movement was pure Soviet agitprop.
[03:50:47.641 --> 03:50:51.003]  They worked through their front operations in Scandinavia.
[03:50:51.403 --> 03:50:54.265]  They created a worldwide movement.
[03:50:55.105 --> 03:50:56.086]  Movies were made.
[03:50:56.506 --> 03:50:57.867]  Big rallies were held.
[03:50:58.307 --> 03:51:05.511]  And the whole purpose was to discourage President Reagan from planting the missiles in Western Germany.
[03:51:05.971 --> 03:51:09.333]  The missiles in Western Germany were the Pershings, I believe.
[03:51:11.454 --> 03:51:16.058]  And Reagan, of course, was stalwart enough to ignore these massive rallies.
[03:51:16.839 --> 03:51:20.182]  Movies like The Day After, you know, where the whole world is getting blown up.
[03:51:20.422 --> 03:51:33.173]  This whole massive movement was created as an exercise in Soviet propaganda out of Moscow, and participating in it were guys like Christopher Steele and Barack Obama.
[03:51:34.855 --> 03:51:42.341]  Of course, we've both looked at Obama's article in the Sundial at the same time when he was at Columbia called Breaking the War Mentality.
[03:51:42.681 --> 03:51:50.807]  Very similar theme that the United States is responsible, the war mentality of Reagan, of Americans is responsible for the Cold War.
[03:51:50.867 --> 03:51:55.190]  If only they would stop their war mentality, peace would break out.
[03:51:57.292 --> 03:52:03.557]  What about, can you comment also on the fact that in this article we were both pretty shocked that toward the end
[03:52:04.446 --> 03:52:09.047]  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, there were Democratic talking points in the dossier.
[03:52:09.868 --> 03:52:10.988]  Yeah, they just sort of inserted.
[03:52:11.028 --> 03:52:11.888]  You're right, Joel.
[03:52:11.928 --> 03:52:13.809]  They just sort of appear out of nowhere.
[03:52:13.849 --> 03:52:22.852]  All of a sudden, they're talking about, you know, Trump being, um, quite unpresidential and, uh, you know, just things that Russians wouldn't even think to say or even think about.
[03:52:22.872 --> 03:52:28.393]  And, um, you know, they didn't sound they sounded much less like Russian intel.
[03:52:28.653 --> 03:52:29.153]  Then you're right.
[03:52:29.173 --> 03:52:31.634]  Then they did like Democratic talking points.
[03:52:32.054 --> 03:52:33.875]  And then when you heard those from
[03:52:34.930 --> 03:52:43.556]  Both Hillary and Obama, the talking points that were in the dossier are Moscow's interference in the elections and Trump's unfitness for office.
[03:52:44.157 --> 03:52:47.259]  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, you've got these talking points.
[03:52:47.679 --> 03:53:01.609]  What was also interesting when we researched it more, of course, was that Cambridge University was actually not only a place that supplied British intelligence agents, but many KGB agents studied at
[03:53:02.296 --> 03:53:03.737]  Cambridge, can you comment on that?
[03:53:04.218 --> 03:53:05.639]  Yeah, I mean, they were doing double duty.
[03:53:05.699 --> 03:53:10.604]  I mean, you had Burgess McLean, Kim Philby, the most notorious of them all, Anthony Blunt.
[03:53:11.765 --> 03:53:19.993]  And these guys created a whole industry in terms of, you know, the guys like John Le Carre, you know, feasted on them for years, because they were
[03:53:20.862 --> 03:53:26.749]  They began to infiltrate British intelligence right out of, while they were in Cambridge.
[03:53:27.130 --> 03:53:29.773]  And what the Soviets had them do was to stop protesting.
[03:53:29.813 --> 03:53:32.276]  Don't be obvious how hard left you are.
[03:53:32.636 --> 03:53:36.321]  Go soft, go subtle, you know, get into the service.
[03:53:36.621 --> 03:53:38.944]  Kim Philby reached almost the very top.
[03:53:39.731 --> 03:53:44.374]  of the British intelligence apparatus before he was finally busted in the early 50s.
[03:53:44.755 --> 03:53:46.496]  Burgess and McLean weren't far behind.
[03:53:46.996 --> 03:53:50.259]  Anthony Blunt was a confidante of the Queen.
[03:53:50.739 --> 03:54:03.888]  These guys were deeply, deeply embedded and what they were doing, of course, was subverting British intelligence, corrupting British intelligence, and funneling that information back to their puppet masters in the Soviet Union.
[03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:08.792]  I don't doubt, I won't say I don't doubt, that's a little strong, I suspect that
[03:54:10.392 --> 03:54:15.495]  I would not be surprised if Christopher Steele were part of that same kind of process.
[03:54:17.175 --> 03:54:17.515]  Okay.
[03:54:18.196 --> 03:54:34.302]  And how can you, you know, what do you say when, if you and I can look at this dossier, which has been online for a year, I don't know why I didn't read it for a year, but if we can take one look at it and see that there's very serious problems.
[03:54:35.483 --> 03:54:49.866]  How could an FBI agent, intelligence officials, the FISA court, use this document which Konstantin Prebogensky said was complete foolish speculation, not an intelligence document of any kind?
[03:54:50.887 --> 03:54:55.068]  How could the media not have looked at it and come up with these conclusions that we did?
[03:54:55.128 --> 03:54:57.768]  Are we the only people that read this stuff?
[03:54:58.108 --> 03:55:00.409]  Or are people intentionally not, don't want to know?
[03:55:01.403 --> 03:55:02.424]  Well, they don't want to know.
[03:55:02.504 --> 03:55:05.305]  And I reached that same conclusion with the Obama-Ayers connection.
[03:55:05.645 --> 03:55:13.789]  When I first, you know, found my way to Bill Ayers, when it became obvious that he was the muse for the Obama's book, I said, how is it that no one noticed this?
[03:55:14.489 --> 03:55:17.111]  And it's even more obvious with the Steele dossier.
[03:55:17.511 --> 03:55:19.132]  It's like, it's problems.
[03:55:19.232 --> 03:55:20.172]  It's grammatic problems.
[03:55:20.212 --> 03:55:21.373]  It's syntactic problems.
[03:55:21.673 --> 03:55:22.653]  It's language problems.
[03:55:23.013 --> 03:55:24.094]  Dropkick you in the teeth.
[03:55:24.354 --> 03:55:25.895]  It's not like they're subtle, you know?
[03:55:26.793 --> 03:55:38.006]  And I get it, FBI guys aren't skilled linguists, but the people in the media know enough to know that this was not written by Christopher Steele.
[03:55:38.227 --> 03:55:39.548]  They knew enough to know that.
[03:55:40.329 --> 03:55:42.932]  And yet so much hinged on Steele's
[03:55:44.912 --> 03:55:53.616]  You know, the sort of authenticity in his character, in his legitimacy, that they chose not to know any more than they had to know.
[03:55:53.977 --> 03:55:56.038]  And most, you know, most, I didn't even read it.
[03:55:56.058 --> 03:55:57.338]  I mean, most people didn't read it.
[03:55:58.459 --> 03:56:01.060]  So they could get away with it and more or less have.
[03:56:01.360 --> 03:56:03.661]  The whole construct is falling apart now.
[03:56:05.362 --> 03:56:08.144]  And there's going to be a lot of un-shoveling when this is finished.
[03:56:08.184 --> 03:56:11.325]  And it'd be fun to get my shovel in there and help them out.
[03:56:13.586 --> 03:56:13.767]  Right.
[03:56:15.700 --> 03:56:25.509]  Does this dossier speak to the fact that it got through to the FISA court, that Christopher Steele was involved, this left-wing intelligence agent?
[03:56:25.549 --> 03:56:41.003]  Does it speak, do you think, to a larger, wider, left-wing, I guess let's quote Hillary Clinton, a vast left-wing conspiracy to get her into office and prevent Donald Trump from being president and crush the will of the American voter?
[03:56:42.068 --> 03:56:43.188]  Yeah, I think you're right, Joel.
[03:56:43.208 --> 03:57:06.558]  I mean, if you look for a logic in the Russian collusion, I mean, let's go back to, you know, Sacco and Vanzetti, when it started in the 1920s, when the Soviet Union realized that they weren't going to be able to create a workers' revolution in the United States, so their role was basically to undermine the role of the United States in the world, you know, to soften the American people, to subvert the ideals of the melting pot, etc.
[03:57:06.758 --> 03:57:09.179]  They've been doing that now for close to a century.
[03:57:09.759 --> 03:57:11.660]  Hillary, if the Soviets
[03:57:12.429 --> 03:57:18.351]  And let's face it, even though the Soviet Union is dead, there are a lot of old communists running the Soviet Union.
[03:57:18.651 --> 03:57:24.193]  People who think the way they always have and are not apologetic about their past.
[03:57:24.813 --> 03:57:26.194]  Who would they want as president?
[03:57:27.463 --> 03:57:29.245]  They would want a Barack Obama as president.
[03:57:29.265 --> 03:57:30.847]  They'd want a Hillary Clinton as president.
[03:57:31.128 --> 03:57:35.252]  They'd want someone who'd roll over, who'd push the restart button, you know?
[03:57:35.933 --> 03:57:36.334]  Okay.
